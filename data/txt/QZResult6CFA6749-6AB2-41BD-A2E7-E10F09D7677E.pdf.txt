BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with improved outcome
after treatment for stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A retrospective review of stage
III NSCLC patients treated at who were treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women’s
Cancer Center was done with institutional review board approval. Patients were followed for toxicity, local
and distant failure, and overall survival. Multivariate Cox logistic regression analysis was used to determine
the factors associated with treatment outcome. RESULTS: Between August 2000 and November 2006, 144
patients received concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) for stage III NSCLC. Eighty of 144 patients were men
(56%), and the median age was 61 years (range, 33-81 years). Sixty-two patients (43%) had stage IIIA
NSCLC, and 82 patients (57%) had stage IIIB NSCLC. Radiotherapy (RT) was given concurrently with chemotherapy to all patients; 100 patients (69%) received CRT without surgery, and 44 patients (31%) received
with neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgical resection. The median RT dose was 60 grays (Gy) (range, 46-70
Gy). The median follow-up was 15 months (range, 3-64 months), the median potential follow-up was 37
months (range, 12-84 months), and the median overall survival was 22 months (95% confidence interval, 1528 months). The 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 68% and 47%, respectively. Among the 44 patients
who underwent resection, the median survival was 61 months, and the 2-year survival rate was 73%. On
multivariate analysis, stage at the time of treatment (stage IIIA vs stage IIIB) and use of surgery were the
only factors associated with improved outcome (P ¼.01 and P ¼.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this

those with a single N2 lymph node involved, to those
with multiple, bulky mediastinal and supraclavicular
lymph nodes.3 Consequently, multiple regimens have
been developed to treat this disease. Among the most
common treatment approaches are concurrent chemoradiation (CRT)4,5 and trimodality therapy, which involves
CRT followed by surgical resection.6,7
The role of surgery in the treatment of stage III
NSCLC remains unproven. A randomized phase 3 trial of
CRT versus trimodality therapy produced an impressive
27% 5-year survival rate with trimodality therapy and a
significant improvement in local control over CRT alone
but did not demonstrate an advantage in overall survival
(OS).8 A high surgical mortality rate in 12 of 54 patients
(26%) who underwent pneumonectomy likely contributed to their shorter survival compared with patients who
received CRT without surgery. In a second randomized
trial in Europe, chemotherapy alone as induction therapy
followed by surgery and postoperative radiotherapy was
compared with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy
alone, and no benefit was observed from the addition of
adding surgery (median survival, 16.4 months vs 17.5
months, respectively; P value not significant).9 The conclusions from those 2 studies are uncertain, because neither study met its primary endpoint for improved OS
with surgery, yet the intergroup trial did produce a meaningful improvement in both local control and progression-free survival with surgery. Therefore, thoracic
oncologists are left with several questions: Is surgery effective only when proceeded by both chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, or should concurrent CRT alone should be
the standard of therapy for stage III NSCLC?
The Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer
Center (DF/BWCC) has a long history of treating
patients who have stage III NSCLC with trimodality therapy. Our experience has been reported from the early
1990s and has emphasized the importance of a pathologic
complete response in the mediastinal lymph nodes as a
predictor of outcome.7 Recurrence in the brain was
reported in the late 1990s as a frequent problem after trimodality therapy.9 More recently, the Intergroup study
reported a surgical mortality rate of 26% for patients who
underwent pneumonectomy after CRT, which was
greater than the 6% mortality rate observed in our
single-institutional study of 73 patients who underwent
pneumonectomy after CRT.10 However, the efficacy of
Cancer

trimodality therapy compared with CRT was not
addressed. Therefore, we believed that it would be useful
to review our most recent experience (since 2000) in
patients with stage III NSCLC who were treated with
definitive CRT as well as trimodality therapy at our
institution. There is significant patient selection between
these therapies; therefore, the objective of the current
study was not to compare these groups directly but rather
to report on overall outcomes (both local and distant),
factors associated with local control, and patterns of
recurrence to provide further information for planning
future prospective studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient population
We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC between January 2000 and
October 2006 who were treated with CRT at DF/
BWCC. Patients were identified from an institutional
database of patients who received chest radiotherapy for
NSCLC. The database was created with institutional
review board approval. Patients were included if they had
stage III NSCLC that was treated with concurrent CRT
or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by CRT. The
patients were evaluated initially by a medical oncologist, a
radiation oncologist, and a general thoracic surgeon in a
multidisciplinary clinic. All patients underwent pretreatment staging, which included chest computed tomography (CT) scans, bone scans or [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-Dglucose positron emission tomography scans, and central
nervous system imaging with either contrast-enhanced
CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical staging,
including fiberoptic bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy,
pulmonary function testing, and split-lung ventilation/
perfusion testing, was done routinely in patients who were
considered for pulmonary resection.
Patients who had pleural effusions with cytologic
involvement of NSCLC, those who had recurrent lung
cancer, and those who underwent surgery as the initial
modality of treatment were excluded from this analysis.
All patients had their performance status graded from 0 to
4 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale,
and histology was assessed according to World Health

Organization criteria.11 Race was identified based on documentation at the time of initial consultation.

Chemotherapy
The regimens of systemic therapy that were given concurrently with radiation therapy varied during the course of
the current review, as explained below. In the initial years
of the study (2000-2004), patients typically were treated
with induction carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC],
6) plus paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) for 2 cycles followed by
weekly carboplatin (AUC, 2) plus paclitaxel (50 mg/m2)
with chest radiotherapy.12,13 After presentation/publication of several clinical trials suggesting that patients who
received etoposide/cisplatin had a better outcome,8,14,15
the patients who were deemed fit to receive the cisplatinbased regimen were treated with every-4-week cisplatin
and etoposide (50 mg/m2), and the patients who were
considered candidates for that regimen were given weekly
carboplatin and paclitaxel. These same trials, in addition
to others16,17 that demonstrated the lack of benefit of
induction chemotherapy before CRT, influenced our
group also to offer initial, concurrent CRT as the standard
of care. Cisplatin/etoposide and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel also were used concurrently with radiation therapy
in the neoadjuvant setting. When concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy was not followed by surgical
resection, consolidation chemotherapy with the same
drugs or with docetaxel was administered.15 Patients who
received sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation
alone or patients in whom the chemotherapy regimen varied from our standard practice, as defined above, were
excluded from the analysis. In total, 18 patients were
treated with other regimens: 2 patients received vinorelbine/cisplatin, 4 patients received vinorelbine alone concurrent with radiation, 1 patient received cisplatin/
gemcitabine, and 11 patients received sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation alone.

Radiotherapy
Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy with
CT-based treatment planning was used in all cases. The
patients typically were simulated with Vac-loc bags (MedTec, Orange City, Iowa) and T-Bar immobilization. CT
simulation was performed using slices from 2.5 mm to 3
4158

mm in thickness. Treatment planning was done with the
ECLIPSE planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo
Alto, Calif). The primary target volumes included the
gross primary tumor volume observed on CT and/or positron emission tomography scans and the involved lymph
node stations. Although the use of elective nodal irradiation (ENI) differed according to the treating physician,
the overall trend was to offer ENI less as time progressed,
consistent with reports in the literature during that period.18,19 After 2004, lung heterogeneity corrections were
used using the ‘‘Modified Batho’’ method. The radiation
dose was prescribed to cover at least 95% of the planning
tumor volume (PTV). Patients received radiation daily in
fractions from 1.8 Gy to 2 Gy. The total dose varied
(range, 46-70 Gy) according to the intent of treatment
(preoperative or definitive). Patients who were to undergo
potential surgical resection typically received up to 54 Gy.
Patients who did not undergo surgery typically received
up to 60 Gy before the implementation of lung heterogeneity corrections (in 2004) and from 66 Gy to 68 Gy
when lung heterogeneity corrections were used.

Surgery
Patients were evaluated for surgical resection before the
start of treatment and after CRT. Patients were considered for resection if their disease was deemed anatomically resectable (without invasion of vertebral bodies,
heart, or great vessels) and if they were deemed medically fit to undergo resection. The patients who were
considered for surgical resection were reimaged during
Weeks 4 and 5 of CRT if their resection status was in
doubt or after CRT if resection was planned from the
beginning. Patients who had tumors that were deemed
unresectable continued chest radiotherapy in doses of
60 Gy to 68 Gy.
A complete pathologic response was defined as
the absence of viable tumor cells in the pathologic
specimen, both in the primary tumor and in the
lymph nodes. Mediastinal downstaging was defined as
the absence of tumor on pathologic examination of
resected lymph nodes that previously had been
involved (N2-N1or N0).20 Acute and late toxicity were
scored according to the Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0).21

Patient Follow-Up
Because all patients in this cohort received all of their therapy within the DF/BWCC, they underwent close medical
and radiation follow-up and, as indicated, surgical oncology follow-up. In general the initial follow-up consisted
of scans obtained at 6 to 8 weeks after therapy. Thereafter,
follow-up continued every 6 to 10 weeks as indicated. All
patients were followed to death or to the last known follow-up. Follow-up documentation, including toxicity,
recurrences, and survival, was obtained retrospectively
from the electronic medical records of the DF/BWCC.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this study was the relation
between the treatment modalities and OS. Secondary
endpoints were locoregional control (LRC) and distant
control (DC). Survival and all other endpoints were calculated from the start of treatment. LRC was defined as freedom from any recurrence involving the primary tumor
location or any regional lymph nodes22 All other recurrences were considered distant metastases. We retrospectively reviewed the scans that documented the local
recurrences and compared the location of the recurrence
with the PTV at the time of simulation to determine
whether the local recurrences were in or outside the fields
of treatment.
The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS, LRC, and DC
rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Because of the retrospective nature of this analysis, known
clinical variables that hypothetically were associated with
the outcome variables were examined in a stepwise multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression method. All covariates that were considered in the
regression model were examined as categorical variables
and included age, sex, race, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, TNM classification, use
of induction chemotherapy (yes or no), type of concurrent
chemotherapy(cisplatin/etoposide vs carboplatin/paclitaxcel), consolidation chemotherapy, surgery (yes or no)
and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) status (yes or
no). Hazard ratios (HRs) for each of the variables of interest were calculated with corresponding 95% CIs and P
values. All P values were 2-sided, and P values .05 were
considered significant. Analyses were performed using R

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
In total, 144 patients received CRT for stage III NSCLC
between January 2000 and October 2006. Sixty-two
patients (43%) had stage IIIA disease, and 82 patients
(57%) had stage IIIB disease; of these 82 patients, 15
(18%) had T4N0 or N1 disease. Nearly all patients
(95%) had an excellent performance status (0 or 1). The
majority of patients were men (56%). The patient
characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Treatment Characteristics
Treatment characteristics are summarized in Table 2.
Chemotherapy

There was some variability in the chemotherapy regimens used in this group. Fifty-six patients (39%) received
induction carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy before
CRT. Fifty-three patients received 2 cycles of induction
chemotherapy, including 1 patient who received 1 cycle
and 2 patients who received 3 cycles. CRT consisted of
weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel for 105 of 144 patients
(73%) and cisplatin plus etoposide every 4 weeks for 39 of
144 patients (27%).
Radiotherapy

The median radiotherapy dose for the whole population was 60 Gy (range, 46-70 Gy), and only 1 patient
received <54 Gy (Table 2). The breakdown of the radiotherapy doses was as follows: 46 Gy (1 patient), 54 Gy
(33 patients), 58 Gy (3 patients), 60 Gy (44 patients), 61
Gy to 64 Gy (11 patients), 66 Gy (20 patients), 68 Gy
(20 patients), and 70 Gy (7 patients). For the patients
who received CRT without surgery, the median radiotherapy dose was 60 Gy (range, 46-70 Gy). Fourteen
patients in that group received <60 Gy, and 5 of those
patients received neoadjuvant CRT but did not undergo
surgery because of disease progression (1 patient), treatment-related toxicity (pneumonitis; 2 patients), decline in
performance status (1 patient), and stroke (1 patient).
The remaining 9 patients had been planned to receive

stage IIIA disease, and the remaining 9 patients had stage
IIIB disease. Of the remaining 94 patients who were not
considered for a neoadjuvant approach, the majority
(74 of 94 patients) had stage IIIB disease. Of the patients
who were selected for a neoadjuvant approach, 36 of
50 patients (72%) underwent surgery, and they all had a
complete resection. Of 14 patients initially were deemed
candidates for resection who did not undergo surgery, 6
patients did not have a radiographic response in the mediastinum, and 3 other patients developed clinically evident
distant metastases at the time of restaging before surgery.
Five additional patients had tumors that were not deemed
resectable based on anatomic criteria, including 2 patients
who had grade 2 radiation pneumonitis, 1 patient who
had a decline in performance status, 1 patient who had a
stroke, and 1 patient who developed Guillen-Barre syndrome. Eight patients received CRT as their definitive
approach and then underwent re-evaluation by the

multimodality team: An attempt at surgical resection was
deemed appropriate because of their radiographic
response to CRT. Two of these patients had initial stage
IIIA disease (T2N2), and the remaining 6 patients had
initial stage IIIB disease (4 patients had T2/T3 N3
disease, and 2 patients had T4N2 disease). Among the 44
patients who underwent surgery after CRT, the operations consisted of lobectomy (24 patients; 14 left,
10 right), bilobectomy (2 patients), pneumonectomy
(12 patients; 11 left, 1 right), and wedge resection (6
patients). The median time between the end of CRT and
surgery was 2 months (range, 1-4 months). The patient
and treatment characteristics in the 2 groups (surgery vs
no surgery) are detailed in Tables 1 and 2.

FIGURE 1. This chart illustrates overall survival for all (n ¼
144) patients in the study.

Neoadjuvant Therapy Pathologic Response
Thirty-two of 44 patients (73%) who had documented
mediastinal (N2 or N3) lymph node involvement and
underwent surgery had pathologic lymph node downstaging (from N3/N2 to N1 or N0). A pathologic complete
response was achieved by 7 of 44 patients (16%) who
underwent surgery.
Survival Analysis
At the time of the current analysis, 81 of 144 patients
(56%) had died, and the remaining 63 patients remained
alive. The median follow-up for the entire group was 15
months (range, 3-64 months), and the median potential
follow-up was 37 months (range, 12-84 months). The
median OS for the entire group was 22 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 15-28 months). The rates of OS,
LRC, and DC for the entire group of 144 patients were
68%, 71%, and 51% at 1 year, respectively; 47%, 46%,
and 38% at 2 years, respectively; and 36%, 42%, and
31% at 3 years, respectively (Fig. 1).
The OS rate for the patients who received CRT followed by surgical resection was 93% at 1 year, 73% at 2
years, and 58% at 3 years. Their median survival was in
excess of 3 years. It is noteworthy that the 30-day postoperative mortality rate in this group was only 1 of 44
patients (3%). The 1 patient who died of acute respiratory
distress syndrome/multisystem organ failure 10 days after
undergoing a left upper lobectomy.
The remaining 100 patients received CRT alone
(median dose, 60 Gy; range, 46-70 Gy). The 1-year and
Cancer

September 15, 2009

2-year OS rates for this group were 59% and 37%, respectively, and the median OS was 15 months.
To better understand the factors associated with
improved outcome, univariate and multivariate analyses
were performed using relevant clinical parameters. Univariate analysis revealed that stage at diagnosis (IIIA vs
IIIB) and surgical resection were the only factors associated with prolonged survival (P ¼ .01 and P ¼ .001,
respectively). Age, sex, type of chemotherapy, and race
were not predictive of survival. Surgical resection was the
most important factor associated with longer survival in
the multivariate Cox regression analysis, with an HR of
0.27 in favor of patients who underwent resection (95%
CI, 0.14-0.049; P<.001). In the cohort of patients that
underwent resection (n ¼ 44), 2 clinical factors were significant predictors of improved outcome. Patients who
received initial concurrent CRT before surgery (n ¼ 27)
fared significantly better than those who underwent
induction chemotherapy before CRT (n ¼ 17) in preparation for surgery (HR, 0.20; P ¼ .016). The survival difference between these groups at 2 years was 46% (94% vs
48%) (Fig. 2). In addition, patients who underwent positron emission tomography staging before surgery (n ¼ 28)
had a better outcome than those who only had CT-based
staging (n ¼ 16), with an HR of 0.30 (P ¼ .05) and a significant difference in 2-year survival (92% vs 58%). It is
noteworthy that neither of these factors was significant in
the larger group of patients who received CRT alone.
No statistically significant differences were observed
in OS, LRC, or DC rates, depending on the type of

that the dose of radiotherapy influenced OS, local recurrence, or DM.

Patterns of Recurrence
At the time of this analysis, 90 of 144 patients (63%) had
experienced either distant recurrence (DR), local recurrence, or both. The median time to progression was 9
months (range, 2-57 months). Among the 90 patients
who experienced recurrence or progression, the site of first
recurrence had a component of local recurrence in 33
patients (37%) and a component of DR in 57 patients
(63%). Among the 33 patients who had locoregional recurrence (LRR) as a component of the first site of cancer
progression, 11 patients had LRR only, and none of these
patients had undergone surgical resection. Of the 57
patients who had some component of DR as their first site
of recurrence, 33 had DR only. Ten of the 33 patients
who had DR only were patients who underwent surgery,
and the other 23 of 33 patients had received CRT alone.
Forty-six patients had first recurrences that were both
LRR and DR. Of the remaining 54 patients who did not
develop recurrent disease, 27 had received trimodality
therapy, and 27 patients received CRT only (Table 3)
4162

LRR at any time was observed in 57 of 144 patients
(40%), and it was the first site of recurrence (or progression) in 33 of those patients. The median time from diagnosis to LRR was 11 months (range, 3-44 months) for all
patients and 10.5 months (range, 3-44 months) for
patients who had LRR as their first site of recurrence. The
specific locations of LRR were at the primary site of disease only for 18 of 57 patients (32%), lymph nodes only
for 15 of 57 patients (26%), and the remaining patients
(24 of 57; 42%) developed recurrent disease in the primary site and lymph nodes simultaneously.
Among the 57 patients who had LRR, 31 patients
(54%) recurred within the radiation field, 10 patients
(17%) recurred beyond the radiation field, and 16
patients (29%) recurred both within and outside of the
chest radiation field. Of the 57 patients who developed
LRR, only 7 of 44 patients (%) had undergone surgery,
whereas 50 of 100 patients (50%) received CRT alone. In
32 of these 50 patients, the LRR was their first site of
recurrence.
DR at any time was observed in 79 of 144 patients
(55%) and, in 57 of 79 patients (72%) was the first site of
recurrence. The DR rate was 39% (17 of 44 patients) after
trimodality therapy; in all but 1 of these patients, DR was
the first site of recurrence. The DR rate was 62% (62 of
100 patients) in the group that received CRT only, and
65% of those represented the first site of recurrence. The
most common sites of DR were brain (n ¼ 33), contralateral lung (n ¼ 17), and adrenal (n ¼ 13).
In total, 33 patients (23%) developed brain metastases at any time during follow-up. The brain was the first
site of recurrence in 20 of 33 patients. The median time to
the development of brain metastasis was 9.5 months
(range, 3-60 months), and it was 7.5 months (range, 3-20
months) in patients who experienced brain metastasis as

their initial site of recurrence. The rate of brain metastasis
was 16% (7 of 44 patients) after trimodality therapy and
26% (26 of 100 patients) after CRT alone. The median
time to brain metastasis was 11 months in the trimodality
group and 8.5 months in the CRT-only group.
Toxicity
Treatment-related toxicity is summarized in Table 4.
Nonhematologic toxicities included grade 3/4 nausea and
vomiting for 8 of 144 patients (5%) and acute esophagitis
for 38 of 144 patients (26%). Of the patients who had
acute esophagitis, 6 developed late chronic esophageal
stricture, which required dilatation. The doses for these 6
patients were 54 Gy (1 patient), 60 Gy (2 patients, 66 Gy
(1 patient), and 68 Gy (2 patients), respectively. The rates
of grade 2 and 3 combined-modality pneumonitis were
12% and 1%, respectively. Two patients developed fatal
combined-modality pneumonitis. One of those patients
died 7 months after the completion of CRT and already
had developed distant metastases. The second patient
died 6 weeks after the completion of CRT. The
volume of lung that received 20 Gy in these 2
patients was 34% and 33.5%, respectively. Both
patients received CRT and did not undergo surgery.
These were the only deaths from nonsurgical toxicity
in the entire cohort of 144 patients.

DISCUSSION
Currently, the most prevalent approach to treating stage
III NSCLC in the United States is concurrent chemotherapy plus chest radiotherapy (CRT).24 Typically, this
approach produces a median survival from 17 months to
20 months and a 3-year survival rate of 23% to 27%. The
best current results, from a phase 2 cooperative group trial
Cancer

September 15, 2009

by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG 9504), produced a 29% 5-year survival rate.25-27 The questions arise:
Where does this approach fail, and how can it be
improved? We reviewed our single-institution experience
in patients with stage III NSCLC to determine the patterns of recurrence in patients who received CRT with
and without surgery and compared the results with those
reported in the literature.
Most striking in our cohort was the outcome for the
subset of 44 patients who received CRT followed by surgical resection. These patients had a median survival in
excess of 3 years and had 2-year and 3-year survival rates
of 73% and 58%, respectively. These results compare
favorably to our experience from the 1990s with trimodality therapy in which the 2-year and 3-year survival rates
were 54% and 44%, respectively.9 Explanations for the
apparent improvement in outcome for the more recent
patients may be improved staging or better selection of
candidates.
Clearly, the patients who were selected for surgery in
our cohort represented a more favorable subgroup than
those who received CRT alone. However, on multivariate
analysis, when we corrected for prognostic factors like disease stage, age, and performance status, surgery remained
the most important prognostic factor for survival. To
determine the reason for this, we examined the patterns of
recurrence in our patients. Patients who received CRT followed by resection had a significantly lower rate of local
recurrence (7%) than patients who received CRT alone
(50%). Similarly, there was a lower distant metastasis rate
for the trimodality group compared with the CRT-only
group (39% vs 62%). The distant metastasis rate of 39%
for trimodality treatment is similar to that reported by
Albain et al. in the Intergroup 0139 trial for the surgical
arm (37%), whereas our rate of distant metastasis in the
CRT arm far exceeded that reported in the Intergroup
trial (42%).8
Excellent results with trimodality therapy also have
been reported in other institutions. Takeda et al. reported
100 patients who received trimodality therapy in Japan.
In their study, they used a combined chemotherapy regimen of mitomycin C, vindesine, and cisplatin together
with a somewhat lower dose of radiation (median, 41 Gy)
and demonstrated a median survival of 40 months.28 The
treatment-related mortality rate in that study was 2.5%.
Similar results also were reported by Uy and colleagues,
4163

Original Article

who reported on 40 patients who received cisplatin/etoposide and thoracic radiation (median dose, 45 Gy); those
authors also reported a 40-month median survival and a
treatment-related mortality rate of 7%.29 Finally,
researchers at the University of Maryland reported a study
of 40 patients in which, in addition to giving concurrent
cisplatin-based chemotherapy with thoracic radiation,
they increased the dose of chest radiation to at least 59
Gy. Those authors reported an increase in median survival
to 53 months and a 0% treatment-related mortality
rate.30 To put our results into context with these other single-institution results, we observed a median survival in
excess of 3 years in our 44 surgically treated patients and a
2% treatment-related mortality rate. In our cohort, we
typically delivered higher doses of radiation preoperatively
(median, 54 Gy), similar to the approach and results from
the Maryland group.
Balanced against these excellent results is the concern that CRT followed by surgery may be too toxic for
some patients. In the randomized Intergroup trial, a benefit of adding surgery to CRT was not demonstrated for
the entire group. One hypothesis for the absence of
benefit from surgical resection was the high rate of perioperative mortality (14 of 54 patients; 26%) after pneumonectomy.8 However in different centers (as discussed
above), including our own, the mortality with CRT
followed by pneumonectomy has been modest (range,
0%-13%).11,10,30,31 This suggests that trimodality therapy likely will continue to have a role for select patients
with stage III NSCLC.
Despite the success of trimodality therapy, the majority of our patients (69%) were not deemed candidates
for surgery and received definitive CRT alone. Because
only 20% to 30% of patients with stage III disease are
likely candidates for surgery, what can be done to improve
the outcome of patients who are treated with CRT alone?
Consistent with other reported data, we observed a median survival of 15 months in this group; and, as expected,
there was a higher percentage of patients with stage IIIB
disease (70%).16,32 The analysis of patterns of recurrence
indicated that 50% (50 of 100 patients) developed local
progression after CRT alone. This high rate of local recurrence is consistent with multiple studies that have used
radiation doses in the 60-Gy range.33-35 These data could
argue for testing more aggressive local approaches to this
disease. Evidence exists in a cooperative group setting2,36
4164

that radiation dose escalation to 74 Gy can be achieved in
patients with stage III NSCLC; and, in a single-institutional setting, doses even beyond 80 Gy have been deliverred.37 Two retrospective analyses from Memorial
Sloan-Kettering and the University of Michigan have produced improvements in OS with increased doses of radiation.38,39 Whether these efforts, in turn, will lead to
improved clinical outcome in stage III NSCLC remains
to be seen and is the subject of an ongoing phase 3
randomized trial by the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group examining 74 Gy versus 60 Gy with concurrent
chemotherapy. However, in our data set, we did not
observe any improvement in outcome when the dose of
radiation was examined as a prognostic factor.
The main impediment to improved outcome, however, is the high DR rate. We observed a 62% DR rate
after CRT alone. Although 50% of patients developed a
local recurrence in this series, only 11 of 100 patients
(10%) developed an isolated local recurrence. This low
level of isolated local recurrence, compared with DR, is
consistent with other studies of CRT. In a recent Cancer
and Leukemia Group B phase 3 trial, the isolated local
recurrence rate was 20% compared with a DR rate of
80%.16 In SWOG 9504, there was a 36% local recurrence
rate compared with a DR rate of 64%.15 These data, along
with the frequent occurrence of a short interval between
DR and death among patients with NSCLC, indicate that
more effective systemic therapy is necessary as the primary
method for improving the overall outcome in patients
with this disease.
The brain was the predominant DR site in this series, in that 23% of all patients developed brain metastases. This high incidence of brain metastases is consistent
with the rate observed in our previous experience in
patients with stage III NSCLC patients.9 More significantly, the time to development of brain metastasis as a
first site of failure was 7.5 months. This indicates the significant effect of brain metastases on OS in these patients.
One option, which must be seriously considered in light
of these results, is the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation. That approach is currently under study in the cooperative group setting, and more data on this issue may be
forthcoming.
The current large cohort of patients who were
treated in the era of concurrent CRT provides some observations. First, patients who are able to undergo surgical

resection after CRT have an excellent outcome, and surgery remains a therapeutic option for properly selected
patients who are treated at experienced centers. Second,
the patterns of failure after trimodality therapy differ from
those after CRT alone. Finally, despite the use of concurrent CRT, significant room for improvement in systemic
therapy is needed to limit DR and significantly improve
OS in patients with stage III NSCLC.
