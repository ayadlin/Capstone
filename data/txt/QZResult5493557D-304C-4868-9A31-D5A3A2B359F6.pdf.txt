ABSTRACT
Cancer gene panels (CGPs) are already used in clinical practice to match tumor’s
genetic profile with available targeted therapies. We aimed to determine if CGPs
could also be applied to estimate tumor mutational load and predict clinical benefit
to PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade therapy. Whole-exome sequencing (WES)
mutation data obtained from melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients published by Snyder et al. 2014 and Rizvi et al. 2015, respectively, were
used to select nonsynonymous somatic mutations occurring in genes included in
the Foundation Medicine Panel (FM-CGP) and in our own Institutional Panel (HSLCGP). CGP-mutational load was calculated for each patient using both panels and
was associated with clinical outcomes as defined and reported in the original articles.
Higher CGP-mutational load was observed in NSCLC patients presenting durable
clinical benefit (DCB) to PD-1 blockade (FM-CGP P=0.03, HSL-CGP P=0.01). We
also observed that 69% of patients with high CGP-mutational load experienced DCB
to PD-1 blockade, as compared to 20% of patients with low CGP-mutational load
(FM-CGP and HSL-CGP P=0.01). Noteworthy, predictive accuracy of CGP-mutational
load for DCB was not statistically different from that estimated by WES sequencing
(P=0.73). Moreover, a high CGP-mutational load was significantly associated with
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with PD-1 blockade (FM-CGP
P=0.005, HR 0.27, 95% IC 0.105 to 0.669; HSL-CGP P=0.008, HR 0.29, 95% IC 0.116
to 0.719). Similar associations between CGP-mutational load and clinical benefit to
CTLA-4 blockade were not observed. In summary, our data reveals that CGPs can be
used to estimate mutational load and to predict clinical benefit to PD-1 blockade, with
similar accuracy to that reported using WES.

need for identification of predictive biomarkers for patient
stratification and selection.
	 Human tumors typically harbor different types of
somatic mutations, including nonsynonymous mutations
that alter amino acid residues of a protein. Altered amino
acid residues resulting from nonsynonymous mutations
can create new T-cell epitopes (neoepitopes) from a
previously self-peptide [5-7], serving as neoantigens
capable of eliciting an antitumor immune response.
Neoantigen formation is thus a probabilistic event, where
each nonsynonymous mutation increases the chances of
immunogenic neoantigen formation. Therefore, tumor
mutational load, defined as the number of nonsynonymous
mutations in the tumor, could be used as a predictive
marker for checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Indeed,
emerging data suggest that recognition of such neoantigens
is a major factor in the activity of immunotherapies. In
addition, tumor mutational load estimated by WES has
proven to be directly associated with clinical benefit to
immune checkpoint blockade [8-10].
In a recent report, Snyder et al. [8] showed that
tumor mutational load, estimated by WES, was higher in
melanoma patients presenting long-term clinical benefit
to CTLA-4 blockade when compared to patients with
minimal or no clinical benefit. In addition, they observed
that a high mutational load was significantly correlated
with improved overall survival (OS) in a discovery cohort
and with a non-significant trend towards improved OS
in the validation cohort. Rizvi et al. [9] also reported a
significant association between tumor mutational load,
estimated by WES, and DCB in NSCLC patients treated
with PD-1 blockade. A significant direct association
between high mutational load and PFS was also reported.
In addition, associations between high mutational load,
DCB and PFS were reproduced in an independent
validation cohort [9]. Finally, Le et al. [10] analyzed 41
patients with progressive metastatic carcinomas with
mismatch repair deficiency (MRD) or mismatch repair
proficiency (MRP) treated with PD-1 blockade. MRD
tumors have 10 to 100 times more somatic mutations
than MRP tumors and these tumors frequently contain
prominent lymphocyte infiltrates, indicating an active
immune response [11,12]. Objective response rates and
PFS were significantly higher in patients with MRD
colorectal tumors and MRD non-colorectal tumors.
Together, these studies demonstrated that a high tumor
mutational load, estimated by WES, may be used to
predict response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.
However, WES is not yet routinely available in the
clinical practice, due to its high cost and time-consuming
analysis. On the other hand, cancer-gene panels (CGPs)
composed by ~300-600 well-characterized cancerrelated genes are now commonly used in the clinics to
match tumor’s genetic profile with available targeted
therapies. By analyzing matched tumor-normal DNA,
CGPs can accurately filter rare germline variants and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

enable unambiguous identification of somatic mutations
in therapeutically relevant cancer-genes in a single assay
at a reasonable cost and timeframe [13,14]. Therefore, in
the present study we sought to determine if CGPs could be
used to accurately estimate mutational load and to predict
response to immune checkpoint blockade, without the
need of tumor WES.

RESULTS
CGP-mutational load is associated with clinical
benefit to PD-1 blockade therapy in NSCLC
patients
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) mutation
data obtained from melanoma [8] and non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients [9] were used to select
nonsynonymous somatic mutations occurring in genes
included in the Foundation Medicine Panel (FM-CGP,
Table S1) and in our own Institutional Panel (HSL-CGP,
Table S2). Mutational load estimated using either one of
the two panels was significantly associated with DCB in
NSLC patients treated with PD-1 blockade. The median
number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations calculated
using FM-CGP was 9 and 5 for tumors from patients with
DCB and NDB, respectively (Mann-Whitney P = 0.03,
Figure 1A and Table S3). For the HSL-CGP, the median
number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations was 18.5
and 8 for tumors from patients with DCB and NDB,
respectively (Mann-Whitney P = 0.01, Figure 1B and
Table S4).
Patients were then grouped, according to their
number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations, in a high
(≥7 for FM-CGP and ≥13 for HSL-CGP) and a low CGPmutational load group (<7 for FM-CGP and <13 for HSLCGP). DCB rates and PFS were significantly greater in
patients with a high CGP-mutational load. We observed
that 69% of patients with high CGP-mutational load,
determined by either one of the two panels, presented
DCB. In contrast, DCB was observed in only 20% of
patients with low CGP-mutational load (Fisher’s exact
test P = 0.01 for FM-CGP and HSL-CGP, Table 1).
Noteworthy, predictive accuracy of CGPs-mutational load
for DCB was not statistically different to that estimated
by WES sequencing (P = 0.73, Figure 1C). All three ROC
curves presented similar AUC, sensitivity and specificity
(Table 2). Finally, a high mutational load calculated by
both CGPs was also significantly associated with PFS
(median PFS 14.5 versus 3.4 months, Log-rank P = 0.005,
HR 0.27, 95% IC 0.105 to 0.669 for the FM-CGP and
median PFS 14.5 versus 3.4 months, Log-rank P = 0.008,
HR 0.29, 95% IC 0.116 to 0.719 for the HSL-CGP, Figure
1D-E).

nonsynonymous somatic mutations was 15 and 9 for
tumors from patients with DCB and minimal or no clinical
benefit, respectively (Mann-Whitney P = 0.24, Figure 2B
and Table S6).
Patients were again grouped according to the
number of mutations in a high and a low CGP-mutational

determined for both groups. Durable clinical benefit

patients in the high and low CGP-mutational load groups,
irrespectively of the panel used (Figure 2C-2D).

The catalogue of cancer types therapeutically
manageable with immune checkpoint blockade therapy is
growing at an astonishing pace. However, less than half of
all patients respond to these treatments [3,4]. Identification

pressing issue, since it would minimize unnecessary
exposure of patients to potentially life-threatening
immune-related toxicities, as well as reduce the financial
costs imposed on health systems by expensive drugs.
Some studies have established partial correlations
between outcomes with CTLA-4 blockade and peripheralblood lymphocyte count, markers of T-cell activation, an
“inflammatory” tumor microenvironment and maintenance
of high-frequency T-cell receptor clonotypes precluding
their utilization in clinics [15-17]. Other studies have
reported that pre-treatment programmed cell death
ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor biopsy directly
correlate with response to anti-PD-1 therapies, but many
tumors scored as PD-L1 positive do not respond, while
some responses occur in PD-L1-negative tumors [18-20].
These controversial results probably reflect the sum of
technical issues related to immunohistochemistry staining
and scoring system, as well as to biologic issues related
to PD-L1 expression on other cells present in the tumor
microenvironment, including infiltrating myeloid cells.
Recent studies, however, demonstrated that tumors
with a high load of nonsynonymous somatic mutations
determined by WES are more likely to respond to
checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, as in theory these
tumors would have a higher diversity of neoantigens that
could trigger an immune response when the CTLA-4/
PD-1 inhibition is bypassed [8-10]. Nevertheless, WES
and neoantigen identification is not yet a routine in the
clinical practice and more straightforward and affordable
approaches to estimate tumor mutational load and predict
response to checkpoint blockade are needed.
Here, we demonstrated that the association between
mutational load and clinical benefit to PD-1 blockade is
also observed when CGPs are used to estimate mutation
burden. Noteworthy, predictive accuracy is apparently
lost when smaller CGPs (<150 cancer-genes) are used to
estimate mutational loads, indicating that comprehensive
gene panels, composed of >300 cancer-genes, should be
employed (Figure S1, Table S8-10). Most importantly, we
demonstrated that comprehensive CGPs can be used to
predict response to PD-1 blockade in clinics with similar
accuracy to results reported by Rizvi and colleagues [9].
Our analysis does not support a similar use for
cancer-gene panels in the prediction of response to
CTLA-4. This result, however, is not totally unexpected
since blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors present
distinct mechanisms of action and the association between
mutational load and clinical benefit also seems to be
weaker for CTLA-4 blockade when compared to PD-1
blockade, as previously reported [8]. Although Snyder
and colleagues have observed a significant association
between mutational load and overall survival in the
discovery cohort, a similar result was not reproduced
in the validation cohort, indicating that mutational load
alone is not sufficient to predict clinical benefit to CTLA4 blockade.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Even though all these studies are limited by the
small number of patients analyzed, our results are
encouraging, considering the broader therapeutic activity
of PD-1 blockade alone or its use in combination with
other therapies. Since CGPs are already routinely used
in many cancer centers to guide therapeutic choices, our
findings will certainly accelerate the validation and the
implementation of mutational load estimates as a clinically
useful predictive marker, further extending the current
benefits of immune checkpoint blockade.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We downloaded WES mutation data from melanoma
and NSCLC patients published by Snyder et al. [8] and
Rizvi et al. [9], respectively, and selected nonsynonymous
somatic mutations occurring in genes included in the
Foundation Medicine Panel (FM-CGP; Table S1),
as well as in a CGP developed at our own Institution
(HSL-CGP; Table S2). In both original studies matched
normal DNA, extracted from peripheral blood, was used
to filter germline variants and to enable unambiguous
identification of somatic mutations. Next, we calculated
the CGP-mutational load for each patient enrolled in these
two studies using just mutated genes present in FM and
HSL CGPs. CGP-mutational loads were then associated
with clinical outcomes as defined and reported in the
original articles [8, 9]. Patients included in discovery and
validation cohorts in the original articles were grouped in
a single larger cohort to increase the statistical power of
our analysis.

Statistical analysis
NSCLC patients with partial or stable response
lasting >6 months were classified as DCB, according to
the original article [9]. For the purpose of this manuscript,
melanoma patients presenting radiographic evidence of
freedom from disease or evidence of a stable or decreased
volume of disease for >6 months (described as longterm benefit patients in the original article [8]) were
also classified as DCB. Mann-Whitney test was used to
compare CGP-mutational loads between groups of patients
with DCB and NDB (no durable benefit). Patients were
then divided in a high CGP-mutational load group (defined
as those equal or above the median mutational load of the
cohort) and low CGP-mutational load group (defined as
those below the median mutational load of the cohort).
The proportion of patients with DCB and NDB in each
group was compared using Fisher’s exact test. Log-rank
test was used to compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves for
each group. All these statistical analyses were performed
34225

using GraphPad Prism v.6 (Graphpad Prism Software,
San Diego, CA). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis was used to discriminate DCB and NDB
patients. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and
specificity for each CGP and WES were determined using
MedCalc software (version 15.6.1). Comparison between
AUC values was carried out according to Delong et al.
[21] using STATA software (version 13.0).
