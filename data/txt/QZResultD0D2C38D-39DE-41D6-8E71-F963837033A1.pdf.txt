Abstract
The topoisomerase II poisons doxorubicin and etoposide constitute longstanding cornerstones of chemotherapy. Despite their
extensive clinical use, many patients do not respond to these
drugs. Using a genome-wide gene knockout approach, we identiﬁed Keap1, the SWI/SNF complex, and C9orf82 (CAAP1) as
independent factors capable of driving drug resistance through
diverse molecular mechanisms, all converging on the DNA double-strand break (DSB) and repair pathway. Loss of Keap1 or the
SWI/SNF complex inhibits generation of DSB by attenuating
expression and activity of topoisomerase IIa, respectively, where-

as deletion of C9orf82 augments subsequent DSB repair. Their
corresponding genes, frequently mutated or deleted in human
tumors, may impact drug sensitivity, as exempliﬁed by triplenegative breast cancer patients with diminished SWI/SNF core
member expression who exhibit reduced responsiveness to chemotherapy regimens containing doxorubicin. Collectively, our
work identiﬁes genes that may predict the response of cancer
patients to the broadly used topoisomerase II poisons and deﬁnes
alternative pathways that could be therapeutically exploited in
treatment-resistant patients. Cancer Res; 75(19); 4176–87. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Anthracyclines, with doxorubicin as their prominent example,
constitute an especially effective class of anticancer drugs, as they
intercalate into the DNA and evict histones from the chromatin,
concomitant to inhibiting Topo II after the formation of a DNA
DSB (3, 4). As a result, the DNA damage response is attenuated
and the epigenome becomes deregulated at deﬁned regions in the
genome (3, 5). The cellular pathways contributing to doxorubicin
resistance have been interrogated extensively, and the drug transporter ABCB1 (MDR1), capable of exporting doxorubicin from
cells (2), has emerged as a major player in this context. Despite its
role in drug removal at the blood–brain barrier, inhibition of
ABCB1 failed to satisfactorily revert unresponsiveness to doxorubicin in the clinic (6). Other factors, acting either alone or in
combination with proteins such as ABCB1, have been implicated
in doxorubicin resistance through the downregulation of either
Topo II or other DNA damage response (DDR) pathway constituents (7, 8). Thus far, none of the above factors have been shown
to individually account for the observed variability in patients'
responses to doxorubicin (1, 9). Taken together, the ﬁndings
reported to date suggest the existence of other as of yet undeﬁned
molecular determinants instrumental in the conversion to a
doxorubicin-resistant state.
Herein we report on a genome-wide screen for factors driving
resistance to doxorubicin using a knockout approach in haploid
cells (10). With the aim of approximating the physiologic situation of patient drug exposure, and by extension drug resistance,
in the tissue culture environment, we iteratively subjected cells to
doxorubicin for three brief periods as a means of selecting for
relative drug resistance. Our screening methodology yielded two
previously described contributors to drug resistance: the aforementioned transporter ABCB1 (2) and the stress response gene
Keap1 (11). We also identiﬁed several novel factors: the gene

Topoisomerase II (Topo II) poisons, including those of the
anthracycline and podophyllotoxin families, are among the
major classes of chemotherapeutics used to treat a wide spectrum
of tumors. These drugs trap Topo II onto the DNA and inhibit
DNA religation, hereby "poisoning" the enzyme and generating
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 1). Despite their broad
applicability, resistance constitutes a frequent clinical limitation
(2). Given the serious side effects associated with their administration, development of a comprehensive panel of treatment
predicting factors could provide a useful clinical tool for matching
chemotherapy to individual patients (1).

New Resistance Mechanisms for Topo II Poisons

product of C9orf82 that appears to function as an inhibitor of
DNA damage repair and the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF
complex subunits SMARCB1 and SMARCE1. Depletion of either
Keap1, C9orf82, or SMARCB1 was found to induce cellular
resistance to Topo II poisons, without signiﬁcantly affecting
sensitivity to either Topo I inhibitors or aclarubicin (Acla), an
analog of doxorubicin that does not induce DNA damage (3, 5).
All genes identiﬁed in the resistance screen were found to
regulate Topo II-induced DNA break formation or subsequent
DNA repair. In the clinic, tumors frequently harbor mutations
or deletions in Keap1, C9orf82, or components of the SWI/SNF
complex (12–14). These may be relevant for patient stratiﬁcation
to doxorubicin-based therapies, as illustrated by the correlation
between expression levels of Keap1 and the SWI/SNF complex
subunits and the response of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
patients to doxorubicin-based treatment. Our data provide a
molecular basis for patient selection in the clinic with regards to
the broadly used Topo II poisons in cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and constructs
HAP1 and MelJuSo cells were grown in IMDM supplemented
with 8% FCS. SKBR7 and HCC1937 cells were grown in RPMI
with 8% FCS. HAP1 cells were generated as described in ref. 15,
sequence veriﬁed during the screen, and kept under low passage
afterwards. MelJuSo cells were initially described in ref. 16 and
sequence veriﬁed in 2013 (3); since then identity was conﬁrmed
by staining for marker MHCII. HCC1937 cells were obtained from
ATCC (www.ATCC.org), where they were validated using STR
proﬁling, and kept under low passage after receipt. SKBR7 cells
were a kind gift from Klaas de Lint (Netherlands Cancer Institute,
Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and analyzed using STR proﬁling in 2015. Keap1 knockdown cells were generated by transduction with lentiviral vectors
containing an shRNA sequence targeting Keap1. Keap1 sh1 targeted the 50 -GCGAATGATCACAGCAATGAA-30 sequence of
Keap1 and Keap1 sh2 the 50 -CGGGAGTACATCTACATGCAT-30
sequence. Cells were maintained under puromycin (2.5 mg/mL)
selection to generate stable knockdown cells. For GFP-C9orf82,
the sequence of full-length C9orf82 was cloned from an Image
clone (#4648932) into the mGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) using
the primers 50 -CCCAAAGCTTCCATGACGGGGAAAAAGTCCTC30 and 50 -CCCAGGTACCCTAGGCTGGCTTTTTTATATC-30 . MelJuSo cells were transfected using effectene (Qiagen) and cells
expressing GFP or GFP-C9orf82 were maintained under continuous selection with G418 (200 mg/mL).
Haploid genetic screen
The haploid genetics screen was performed as described (10). In
brief, gene trap virus was produced by transfecting the gene-trap
plasmid together with packaging plasmids in HEK 293T cells.
Virus was harvested, concentrated, and used to infect 1  108
HAP1 cells. After brief passaging to allow for protein turnover,
mutagenized cells were exposed to the doxorubicin regimen
described below. Drug-resistant cells were expanded, genomic
DNA was isolated, and subsequently retroviral insertion sites were
ampliﬁed by inverse PCR and mapped by parallel sequencing
(Illumina HiSeq2000) of the genomic inserts. The enrichment of
insertions in the drug-treated group was calculated by comparing
the number of insertions between the doxorubicin-treated group

www.aacrjournals.org

and an unselected population (15) using a one-sided Fisher exact
test. These values were corrected for false discovery rate using the
Benjamini and Hochberg method (10).
Generation of null alleles using CRISPR-Cas9
CRISPR targeting sequences were designed on the basis of the
tool from crispr.mit.edu (17). Oligos were cloned into the pX330
backbone (18) and transfected using effectene (Qiagen) together
with a vector containing a guide RNA to the zebraﬁsh TIA gene (50 ggtatgtcgggaacctctcc-30 ) and a blasticidin resistance gene with a 2A
sequence that is ﬂanked by two TIA target sites. Cells positive for
both vectors excise the blasticidin resistance gene from the vector
and will sporadically incorporate it into the targeted genomic
locus by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ; ref. 19). Successful
integration of the cassette into the targeted gene disrupts the allele
and renders cells resistant to blasticidin. The targeting sequences
were: SMARCB1: KO1, 50 -TGGCGCTGAGCAAGACCTTC-30 and
KO2, 50 -TGGCGCTGAGCAAGACCTTC-30 , C9orf82: KO1, 50 -CAACGCGGGTACGATGTCCG-30 and KO2, 50 -TGACGGGGAAAAAGTCCTCC-30 , and Nrf2: 50 -TGGAGGCAAGATATAGATCT30 . Cells were selected on blasticidin (10 mg/mL) for two days
and knockout clones were validated by sequencing the genomic
DNA. The following primers were used to detect deletion at the
genomic level: SMARCB1 fw: 50 -CATTTCGCCTTCCGGCTTCGG-30 ,
SMARCB1 rv: 50 -CTCGGAGCCGATCATGTAGAACTC-30 , C9orf82
fw: 50 -GGAAGTGACGCATAACCTGCGAC-30 , C9orf82 rv: 50 -CTGCAAGGAGCCCGAGACG-30 , Nrf2 fw: 50 -GACATGGATTTGATTGACATACTTTGGAGGC-30 , Nrf2 rv: 50 -CTGACTGGATGTGCTGGGCTGG-30 .
Reagents and siRNA transfections
Doxorubicin, etoposide, and topotecan were obtained from
Pharmachemie and daunorubicin was obtained from SanoﬁAventis. Aclarubicin was obtained from Santa Cruz. Antibodies
used for immunoprecipitation, Western blot and microscopy:
mouse anti-Keap1, mouse anti-tubulin, mouse anti-actin (all
from Sigma), rabbit anti-Topoisomerase II, rabbit anti-SMARCB1,
rabbit anti-SmarcA4, rabbit anti-SMARCE1, rabbit anti-ARID1a
(all from Bethyl laboratories), mouse anti-gH2AX, rabbit antiH2A (Millipore).
For siRNA-mediated depletion of SMARCA4 and SMARCB1,
cells were reverse transfected with DharmaFECT transfection
reagent #1 and 50 nmol/L siRNA (Human siGenome SMARTpool; Dharmacon) according to the manufacturing protocol.
Brieﬂy, siRNAs and DharmaFECT were mixed and incubated for
20 minutes, after which cells were added and left to adhere. Three
days later, cells were treated and lysed for SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting analysis or left to grow out for three more days for the cell
viability assay.
Long-term proliferation assays
Cells were seeded into 12-well plates (5,000 cells per well). The
next day, drugs were added at concentrations indicated and
cultured for 2 hours. Subsequently, drugs were removed and cells
were left to grow for 7 to 9 days, ﬁxed using 3.7% formaldehyde,
and stained using 0.1% Crystal violet solution (Sigma). Quantiﬁcation of colonies was done by ImageJ.
Short-term growth inhibition assays
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (2,000 cells per well)
and exposed the next day to the indicated drugs (for siRNA

knockdowns, cells were seeded three days before treatment).
Drugs were removed two hours later and cultured for an
additional 72 hours. Cell viability was measured using the Cell
Titer Blue viability assay (Promega). Relative survival was
normalized to the untreated control and corrected for background signal.
Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting
For coimmunoprecipitation experiments of nuclear proteins,
cells were trypsinized, counted and lysed (25 mmol/L HEPES
pH 7.6, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 25 mmol/L KCl, 0.05 mmol/L EDTA,
10% glycerol and 0.1% NP-40 supplemented with complete
EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)). Nuclei were
isolated by spinning at 1,300  g and subsequently sonicated
for 30 minutes in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150
mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% NP-40 supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)]. Chromatin was removed by centrifugation
(5 minutes at 12,000  g) and the supernatant was precleared
with protein G dynabeads (Life Technologies). Lysate was incubated overnight with 3 mg antibody and 20 mL protein G Dynabeads. Beads were washed extensively and resuspended in SDSsample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% b-mercaptoethanol, 60
mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 6.8 and 0.01% bromophenol blue) before
analysis by SDS-PAGE.
For whole-cell lysate analyses, cells were lysed directly in SDS
sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% b-mercaptoethanol, 60
mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 6.8 and 0.01% bromophenol blue). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Blocking
of the ﬁlter and antibody incubations were done in PBS supplemented with 0.1 (v/v)% Tween and 5% (w/v) bovine milk
powder.
Constant-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
DNA DSBs were quantiﬁed by constant-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
as described (20). In short, HAP1 cells were treated with doxorubicin or Etoposide for 2 hours. Drugs were removed and cells
were lysed and processed immediately to isolate the DNA. Samples were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel to separate faster
migrating broken DNA from intact DNA and fragments of over
>1 MB. Images were analyzed by ImageJ.
Flow cytometry
Cells were treated with doxorubicin (2 mmol/L) for one hour
and trypsinized and ﬁxed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Fluorescence
of doxorubicin was measured directly using a FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and further analyzed by FlowJo
software.
cDNA synthesis and qPCR
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative RT-PCR were
performed as described previously (21). The primers for detection
of Keap1, NQO1, and GAPDH expression were: Keap1 fw: 50 CTGGAGGATCATACCAAGCAGG-30 , Keap1 rv: 50 -GAACATGGCCTTGAAGACAGG-30 , NQO1 fw: 50 -GGGCAAGTCCATCCCAACTG-30 , NQO1 rv: 50 -GCAAGTCAGGGAAGCCTGGA-30 , GAPDH
fw: 50 -TGTTGCCATCAATGACCCCTT-30 , GAPDH rv: 50 -CTCCACGACGTACTCAGCG-30 .
Confocal microscopy
MelJuSo cells were seeded on coverslips and treated as indicated
in the respective experiments. Cells were ﬁxed in 3.7% formal-

4178 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

dehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100.
Staining was performed with the antibodies mentioned above or
with phalloidin (Invitrogen) to stain F-actin and DAPI (Invitrogen) to stain DNA. Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5
confocal microscope.
Chromatin association assay
HAP1 cells were seeded and treated with Etoposide for
15 minutes before lysis when indicated. Cells were lysed in
lysis buffer (25 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.6, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 25
mmol/L KCl, 0.05 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40)
and nuclei were spun down and resuspended at a concentration of 60 million/mL in buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 3
mmol/L EDTA). Twenty-ﬁve microliter samples were adjusted
to the indicated NaCl concentrations to a total volume of 50
mL. After mixing and incubation on ice for 20 minutes, chromatin was spun down and resuspended in sample buffer. After
sonication, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting.
Gene expression analysis of the neoadjuvant breast cancer
cohort
Gene expression data was obtained from 113 pretreatment
biopsies of TNBC patients treated at the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital (associated to the NKI) and scheduled to receive
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients had a breast carcinoma with either a primary tumor size of at least 3 cm, or the
presence of axillary lymph node metastases. A treatment regimen was assigned to each patient, consisting of six courses of
dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (ddAC). If the therapy response was considered unfavorable by MRI evaluation after
three courses, ddAC was changed to capecitabine/docetaxel (XD).
Response to therapy was deﬁned as pathological complete
response (pCR) or no pathologic complete response at the time
of surgery.
Sixty-three Samples were labeled and hybridized to Illumina
6v3 arrays (Illumina). Data were log2 transformed and betweenarray normalized using simple scaling. When a single gene was
represented by multiple probes, the probe with the highest
variance was chosen. The data is made available through the
GEO database, accession GSE34138 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc¼GSE34138; ref. 22). Fifty samples
were proﬁled using RNAseq. Strand-speciﬁc sequencing libraries
were generated using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample preparation guide (Illumina Part # 15031047 Rev. E) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Deep Sequencing was done with a
HiSeq2000 machine (Illumina Inc). The reads are mapped against
the human reference (hg19) using Tophat (version 2.0.6) (23).
Tophat was supplied with a known set of genemodels using a GTF
ﬁle (Ensembl version 66). HTSeq-count (24) was used to deﬁne
gene expressions. This tool generates a list of the total number of
uniquely mapped reads for each gene that was provided in the
GTF. These data were normalized on the basis of the relative
library size using the DESeq2 R package (25) and subsequently log
transformed.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least three times in an
independent manner. All data are presented as means  SD. The
results were analyzed by using a paired two-tailed Student t test

genomic insertion of the virus into the sense direction of a gene
disrupts its expression and often results in a complete knockout of
the gene. HAP1 cells were infected with a gene trap retrovirus to
generate a pool of randomly mutagenized cells and brieﬂy passaged prior to drug exposure. To recapitulate the normal pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in a tissue culture setting, we
exposed these cells for 2 hours to 1 mmol/L doxorubicin, which
is within the peak plasma dose of standard treatment of cancer
patients (26). Cells were treated weekly for 3 weeks, after which
surviving cells were grown out and insertions were mapped and

aligned to the human genome (Fig. 1A). Disruptions of six genes
were signiﬁcantly enriched (P < 0.00005) in the surviving population compared with the untreated control (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1) Among these were two previously reported
factors, ABCB1 (6) and Keap1 (27), as well as novel factors,
including the SWI/SNF subunits, SMARCB1 and SMARCE1, the
C9orf82 gene, and the translation initiation factor Eif4a1. Canonical doxorubicin target Topo IIa appeared just below the threshold, with an adjusted P value of 0.01. ABCB1 contained mostly
antisense mutations following selection, which could enhance its
expression (unpublished observation). All other enriched genes
contained at least ﬁve independent insertions in the sense direction, leading to their inactivation. Identiﬁcation of Keap1 provided validation of the screening methodology, as it has already been
associated with resistance to several anticancer drugs, including
doxorubicin (11, 12, 28).
To validate the screen hits, we generated HAP1 cells stably
expressing either control shRNA or two independent shRNAs
targeting Keap1, which reduced Keap1 expression by 50% to
80% (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1A). These knockdown
cell lines were subsequently exposed to doxorubicin for 2 hours,
followed by drug wash out and outgrowth. As expected, Keap1
depletion conferred doxorubicin resistance as illustrated in both
colony formation and viability assays (Fig. 1D and Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
We then proceeded to validate the novel screen hits. Two
independent CRISPR/Cas9 constructs targeting the SMARCB1
gene (Fig. 1E) rendered the cells more resistant to doxorubicin,
both in colony formation and viability assays (Fig. 1F and
Supplementary Fig. S1C). Independent identiﬁcation of two
members of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex (29),
SMARCB1, and SMARCE1, suggested that deregulation of the
complex as a whole may drive resistance to doxorubicin. Although
we could not validate a role for SMARCE1 in resistance to
doxorubicin, shRNA-mediated depletion of the SWI/SNF core
members SMARCA4 and ARID1A, alongside SMARCB1, induced
resistance to doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E),
supporting the notion that loss of the SWI/SNF complex functionality confers resistance to doxorubicin.
While we did not further pursue the translational elongation
complex subunit Eif4a1, we tested the contribution of the open
reading frame 82 on chromosome 9 (C9orf82) to doxorubicin
sensitivity. A small but signiﬁcant growth advantage was observed
in response to doxorubicin treatment in C9orf82 knockout cells
using a colony formation assay (Fig. 1G and H). Collectively, our
genome-wide screen identiﬁed multiple novel factors capable of
incurring resistance to doxorubicin in a cell culture setting.
Cross-resistance to other DNA-damaging drugs
Doxorubicin is known to act on cells by a combination of Topo
II poisoning, eviction of histones from the chromatin and the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; refs. 3, 4, 30). To
establish which of these mechanisms are affected by Keap1, the
SWI/SNF complex, and C9orf82, we treated the respective knockdown or knockout cell lines with either the different Topo II
poisons daunorubicin (an anthracycline with a structure and
activity similar to doxorubicin) or etoposide (a Topo II poison
structurally unrelated to doxorubicin and incapable of evicting
histones), or with aclarubicin (an anthracycline family member
that evicts histones, induces ROS and inhibits Topo II but does not
induce DNA damage; ref. 31). Silencing Keap1 or eliminating

4180 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

SMARCB1 or C9orf82 rendered cells more resistant to both
etoposide and daunorubicin, but not aclarubicin (Fig. 2A–C) as
indicated by viability as well as colony formation assays. Given
the properties of the three drugs, these observations provide hints
as to the molecular mechanisms underlying doxorubicin resistance via these genes, through the DNA damage arm. Interestingly,
C9orf82 depletion rendered cells more resistant to etoposide than
to doxorubicin or daunorubicin, suggesting that fast DNA repair
may be critical for this gene's mode of action, as doxorubicin and
daunorubicin attenuate DNA repair by eviction of H2AX (5).
Importantly, depletion of none of our hits induced measurable resistance to the topoisomerase I poison topotecan that
induces single-strand DNA breaks (Fig. 2C and D), suggesting
that Keap1, the SWI/SNF complex, and C9orf82 are involved in
the Topo II-dependent DDR pathway.
Keap1 controls the expression of Topo IIa independently of
Nrf2
Of the three validated resistance factors from the screen, Keap1
has been previously linked to chemoresistance (11, 27, 32). Keap1
functions as an E3 ligase adaptor and is known to mediate the
degradation of Nrf2, a transcription factor for oxidative stress
response genes (33). Upregulation of Nrf2 desensitizes cells to
several anticancer drugs, including alkylating and antimitotic
agents, which suggests that downregulation of Keap1 may induce
drug resistance by stabilizing Nrf2 (12, 27, 28). To test this, we
used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate Nrf2 knockout cells
(Fig. 3A), functionally validated by a drastic reduction of expression of Nrf2 target gene NQO1 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Unexpectedly, silencing of Keap1 in the Nrf2-null background still
endowed cells more resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide (Fig.
3A), implying the existence of an Nrf2-independent mechanism
for Keap1 in modulating cellular responsiveness to Topo II–
dependent DNA damage inducers.
Double-strand DNA break analysis indicated that loss of Keap1
signiﬁcantly decreases the amount of such breaks induced by either
etoposide or doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3B). These results were
corroborated by the observed reduction in the DDR as measured
by g-H2AX following exposure to etoposide (doxorubicin evicts
H2AX from the DNA and was therefore not used to measure the
DDR after drug exposure; Fig. 3C). Keap1 silencing did not affect
uptake of doxorubicin (monitored by intrinsic ﬂuorescence of the
drug by ﬂow cytometry, Fig. 3D), suggesting that Keap1 may
control either the levels or activity of the drug target, Topo IIa.
Cells depleted of Keap1 had lower Topo IIa expression levels
relative to the control (Fig. 3E), which was independent of Nrf2
activity (Fig. 3F). A link between Topo IIa expression levels and
resistance against Topo II poisons has been previously suggested
(7, 34, 35). These observations indicate that Keap1 can control
resistance to Topo II poisons by two distinct mechanisms, regulating Nrf2 expression to control a series of stress-response genes
and by mediating the expression of the canonical target Topo IIa.
C9orf82 regulates repair of DNA damage induced by TopoII
poisons
In contrast with the previously studied role of Keap1 in drug
resistance, the role of C9orf82 in this context has not been
addressed, with its only function thus far assigned being negative
regulation of apoptosis (36). We began by addressing the effect of
this gene on Topo II induced DSB formation and repair as
pertaining to Topo II function. Monitoring the DNA DSBs and

the resulting DNA damage response following exposure to either
doxorubicin or etoposide revealed no difference in the initial
levels of DNA damage incurred between the control and C9orf82
knockout cells (Fig. 4A and B). Strikingly, the resolution of the
DNA damage response signal following etoposide treatment (as
visualized by g-H2AX) was signiﬁcantly accelerated in C9orf82
knockout cells (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with

another independently generated C9orf82 knockout clone (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C). Conversely, ectopic expression of
GFP-tagged C9orf82 in MelJuSo melanoma cells (a cell line with
fast DNA repair kinetics) led to a stronger and more persistent
g-H2AX DNA damage response upon etoposide treatment
(Fig. 4C). As DNA repair already takes place during the ﬁrst hour
of etoposide treatment, these data indicate that C9orf82

inﬂuences the kinetics of g-H2AX resolution and hereby the DNA
damage response. To assess whether C9orf82 regulates DSB repair
itself, we determined the DSB repair kinetics in cells overexpressing either GFP or GFP-C9orf82 (Fig. 4D), with the latter resulting
in decreased etoposide-induced DNA DSB repair. This suggests
that C9orf82 decreases the rate of DNA repair.
Although C9orf82 localizes primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 4E), it
is unlikely to directly inhibit DNA repair, as it is not recruited to
Etop-induced g-H2AX foci (Supplementary Fig. S3D). On this
basis, C9orf82 appears to attenuate DNA DSB repair induced by
Topo II poisons, for its loss serves to accelerate DNA damage
repair, thereby promoting resistance to DNA DSB inducers such as
doxorubicin and etoposide. The exact molecular mechanism of
DNA repair modulation by this novel protein is at present unclear.
The SWI/SNF complex controls chromatin loading of Topo II to
confer drug resistance
In addition to the resistance factors described above, we also
identiﬁed two subunits of the SWI/SNF complex involved in

4182 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

the resistance to Topo II poisons. The SWI/SNF complex is
known to modulate transcription through chromatin remodeling (29). In addition, it has recently been shown to mediate
decatenation of chromatids during mitosis by loading Topo IIa
onto the DNA (37). The latter suggests a possible means by
which the SWI/SNF complex may affect the susceptibility of
cells to Topo II poisons, by reducing the chromatin loading and
activity of Topo IIa. To address this, HAP1 cells either proﬁcient
in or depleted of the SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1 were exposed
to etoposide or doxorubicin, and the resulting DNA DSBs were
quantiﬁed. The SMARCB1-depleted cells exhibited signiﬁcantly
lower levels of such DNA breaks (Fig. 5A), as well as reduced
DNA damage response signaling, as visualized by g-H2AX
analysis (Fig. 5B and C). These changes were not a result of
drug uptake deﬁciency (Fig. 5D) or altered expression levels
of Topo IIa (Fig. 5E). Given that SMARCB1 interacts with
Topo IIa (Fig. 5F; ref. 37), the expected reduction in loading
of Topo IIa onto the DNA in cells compromised for SMARCB1
presents a likely explanation for the diminished efﬁcacy of

Topo II poisons in these cells. To conﬁrm this, we assessed
the association of Topo IIa to the chromatin using a chromatin
binding assay as described in ref. 37. Treatment of cells
with etoposide yielded more Topo IIa loaded onto chromatin
(Fig. 4G), indicating this assay can be used to assess Topo IIa
activity and arrest. In line with our hypothesis, SMARCB1
depletion resulted in a decreased amount of Topo IIa loaded
onto chromatin after etoposide exposure (Fig. 4G), indicating
that loss of SMARCB1 reduces the level of Topo IIa that is
poisoned on the chromatin. These results suggest that the SWI/
SNF complex modulates resistance to TopoII poisons by controlling the loading of Topo IIa onto the DNA.
Expression of SWI/SNF subunits in epithelioid sarcoma and
TNBCs correlates to doxorubicin response
Although mutations in the SWI/SNF members are frequently
observed in human tumors (14), their relationship to clinical
outcome is lacking. Epithelioid sarcomas are known to harbor
deletions of the SMARCB1 gene in 60% to 90% of the cases (38,
39) and are commonly treated with doxorubicin-containing regimens. Re-analysis of a previously reported dataset (39) revealed
that patients with a deletion for SMARCB1 experienced more
relapses after treatment (Fig. 6A), suggesting a relationship
between SMARCB1 expression and treatment outcome. To further
assess whether SWI/SNF status correlates directly with patient
responses to treatment with Topo II poisons, we used an expression dataset of 113 human TNBC patients treated at our cancer
center with a regimen of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. We
compared the expression of the SWI/SNF complex subunits
SMARCB1, SMARCA4, SMARCE1, and ARID1a with the clinical

www.aacrjournals.org

response to this treatment. Our analysis showed that patients with
a pathologic complete response had a signiﬁcantly higher expression of SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 (Fig. 6B), but not ARID1a or
SMARCE1 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Furthermore, by analyzing
the other genes identiﬁed from the screen, we found a signiﬁcant
correlation between response and expression for Keap1, but not
C9orf82 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). These data suggest that in
TNBC patients, low expression of SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 is
associated with poor response to a doxorubicin-containing
regimen.
To validate that SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 causally regulate
sensitivity to doxorubicin in TNBC settings, we silenced both
genes in two TNBC cell lines, HCC1937 and SKBR7 (Keap1
silencing was toxic for these cells and could not be tested).
Silencing of both genes rendered cells more resistant to doxorubicin (Fig. 6C) and led to a reduced induction of DNA damage
signaling (Fig. 6D).
Thus, loss or reduced expression of SMARCB1 and SMARCA4
negatively affects doxorubicin-induced DNA DSB formation
and leads to drug resistance in TNBC cell lines and patients.

Discussion
Annually, nearly 1 million cancer patients are treated with Topo
II poisons such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, or etoposide. Yet,
resistance to these drugs persists as a major complication in cancer
treatment. Because the molecular basis for this resistance is not
fully understood, many patients receive ineffective treatments
accompanied by adverse side effects in the absence of the corresponding clinical beneﬁt (1). To facilitate treatment outcome

predictions for doxorubicin relative to other available alternative
drugs, improved insights into the mechanisms of drug resistance
are necessary. Using a genome-wide screening approach, we
identiﬁed and characterized several novel factors involved in
resistance to Topo II poisons. In addition to the previously
described factors, including the drug transporter ABCB1 and
adaptor Keap1, we identiﬁed C9orf82 and the SWI/SNF complex
as novel regulators of doxorubicin resistance. Keap1, C9orf82,
and SWI/SNF can all be placed in the pathway involving Topo IIinduced DNA double-strand break formation and the subsequent
DDR (Fig. 7). Consequently, depletion of these genes does not
confer resistance to either the Topo I inhibitor topotecan, or
aclarubicin, an anthracycline that does not induce DNA DSBs (3).
Keap1 has already been studied in the context of chemosensitivity to several classes of anticancer drugs, including alkylating
agents, antimitotic agents, and Topo II poisons (11, 28, 32).
Inhibition of its cognate substrate Nrf2 sensitizes cells to a number
of these drugs, suggesting that Keap1 inﬂuences sensitivity by

4184 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

virtue of Nrf2 destabilization (11, 28). However, Keap1 controls
several other signaling pathways (40–42), and could thus affect
drug resistance in other ways. We interrogated these two options
by depleting Nrf2 and found that asides from regulating Nrf2,
Keap1 induces resistance to Topo II poisons by controlling
the expression levels of Topo IIa. Clinically, we show that
the expression of Keap1 is correlated to the response of TNBC
patients to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Keap1-inactivating mutations and deletions are frequently observed in human
tumors (43, 44). For example, 12% to 15% of lung tumors have
inactivated Keap1 (43) and as these tumors are frequently treated
with combinations of etoposide and cisplatin, it may be beneﬁcial
to determine patients' Keap1 mutational status to assess the
proper treatment protocol.
We also deﬁned C9orf82 as a novel factor involved in resistance
to Topo II poisons, most notably etoposide. A previous study has
identiﬁed C9orf82 as a negative regulator of caspase-mediated
apoptosis (36), which is not in line with our observations that

experiments. Statistical signiﬁcance was
calculated compared with control

C9orf82 depletion desensitizes cells to etoposide. Our data indicate that C9orf82 is a nuclear protein that controls the rate of DNA
DSB repair after exposure to Topo II poisons. Doxorubicin itself
slows down DNA repair, which might explain why the resistance is
most prominent following etoposide exposure. Given that most
etoposide-induced DNA DSBs are repaired by NHEJ (45),
C9orf82 may impinge on this arm of the DNA repair pathway,
but how is currently unclear. C9orf82 is found mutated in 7% to
11% of glioblastoma tumors (13, 46), which makes it a potential
prognostic factor in the treatment of such patients with etoposide.
However, further studies integrating clinical response data with
mutational analyses are required to substantiate this possibility.
Besides this relatively unknown protein, we characterized the
role of the SWI/SNF complex in the resistance to TopoII poisons.
The SWI/SNF complex is mutated in around 20% of human
tumors (14) and has been linked to tumor suppression (37).
SWI/SNF complex subunits like SMARCB1 control the loading of
Topo IIa onto the DNA and hereby determine the extent of DNA
damage induced following exposure to Topo II poisons.
SMARCB1-depleted cells therefore have less DNA breaks when
exposed to Topo II poisons and thus a growth advantage. As many
of the tumors that harbor mutations in the SWI/SNF complex are
treated with Topo II poisons, drug resistance could arise even
when Topo IIa is expressed.
Several lines of evidence support this notion in patients. For
example, SMARCB1 is mutated in 90% to 100% of the rhabdoid
tumors (47, 48), a very aggressive childhood tumor that is
unresponsive to doxorubicin (49). Also, epithelioid sarcoma
patients harboring deletions for SMARCB1 have a higher chance
of relapse following treatment protocols that usually includes

Topo II poisons (39). Furthermore, we explored a data set of
TNBC patients where both gene expression and treatment
responses were documented. A correlation between treatment
response and expression of SWI/SNF subunits SMARCB1 and
SMARCA4 was observed within patients treated with doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide. No correlation was observed for
SMARCE1 and ARID1a, which could be because SMARCE1 is
not a part of the core complex essential for activity and ARID1a has

Figure 7.
Model of SWI/SNF, Keap1, and C9orf82 regulating different phases of Topo II
poison-induced DNA break formation and DDR. Topo II poisons like
doxorubicin induce DNA DSBs by trapping Topo II on the DNA. If not
sufﬁciently repaired, this leads to cell death. Keap1 controls the expression of
Topo IIa, while SWI/SNF regulates the loading and hereby activity of Topo IIa.
Loss of these genes therefore attenuates DNA DSB formation by Topo II
poisons. In the next phase of the DNA breaks and repair cycle, C9orf82
controls DNA repair. Loss of C9orf82 accelerates DNA repair, reducing cell
death induced by Topo II poisons.

redundancy with ARID1b (29), or because the expression of these
factors is not the limiting factor for the complex to function. Given
the resistance to doxorubicin observed in our cell culture experiments, these data suggest that patients with low or depleted SWI/
SNF expression should not be treated with doxorubicin, but rather
with aclarubicin or topotecan, which are drugs that work through
a different mechanism and that do not show any cross resistance
in our experiments.
In conclusion, we identiﬁed and characterized three factors
controlling sensitivity to the frequently used anticancer drugs
doxorubicin and etoposide. Keap1, C9orf82, and the SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complex all act by affecting DNA DSB
formation or repair following exposure to these drugs. Mutations in these genes are frequently observed in human tumors
and expected to yield tumors that are resistant to these drugs,
as we show for TNBC patients. Proﬁling patients for mutations in these genes can further stratify treatment options as
nonresponding patients can be selected for other treatments
rather than given ineffective treatment containing Topo II
poisons.
