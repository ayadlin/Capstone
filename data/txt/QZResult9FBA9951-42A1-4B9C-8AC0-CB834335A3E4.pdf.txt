ABSTRACT
Capsaicin, the pungent alkaloid of red pepper has been extensively studied
for its many properties, especially the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant ones. It
binds to vanilloid receptor 1, although it has been reported to be able to mediate
some effects independently of its receptor. Another important property of Capsaicin
is the anticancer activity against highly malignant tumors, alone or in combination
with other chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we found that Capsaicin induced
an apoptotic cell death in PEL cells correlated with the inhibition of STAT3. STAT3
pathway, constitutively activated in PEL cells, is essential for their survival. By
STAT3 de-phosphorylation, Capsaicin reduced the Mcl-1 expression level and
this could represent one of the underlying mechanisms leading to the Capsaicinmediated cell death and autophagy induction. Next, by pharmacological or genetic
inhibition, we found that autophagy played a pro-survival role, suggesting that
its inhibition could be exploited to increase the Capsaicin cytotoxic effect against
PEL cells. Finally, we show that Capsaicin induced DAMP exposure, as for an
immunogenic cell death, directly promoted DC activation and, more importantly,
that it counteracted the immune-suppression, in terms of DC differentiation,
mediated by the PEL released factors.

cell death [11, 12]. Besides STAT3, PEL cells relay on
the constitutive activation of other pathways for their
survival [13, 14]. In this study, we investigated whether
Capsaicin would affect PEL cell survival and reduce
the STAT3 constitutive phosphorylation. Moreover, we
explored whether Capsaicin would also induce autophagy
in PEL cells and its role on cell viability. Previous studies
have shown that Capsaicin can induce autophagy either
as a pro-death [15] or as a pro-survival mechanism [16,
17]. The expression level of molecules belonging to
Bcl-2 family, such as Mcl-1, have been reported to be
influenced by the level of STAT3 phosphorylation [18,
19] and regulate both apoptosis and autophagy [20].
Thus, we next evaluated the level of expression of Mcl-1
in PEL cells treated with Capsaicin, in comparison with
cells treated with AG490 STAT3 inhibitor, to investigate
whether STAT3 inhibition could be a possible underlying
mechanism influencing apoptosis and autophagy in PEL
cells treated with Capsaicin. Besides successfully killing
tumor cells, Capsaicin has been reported to have also

INTRODUCTION
Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide)
is the principal component of hot peppers, plants from
the genus Capsicum, member of Solanaceae family.
Capsaicin has been shown to exert many positive effects
on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems and has
also been employed in pain relief, weight loss and cancer
prevention [1]. Besides that, Capsaicin has an anticancer
effect against several solid [2–5] and hematological
tumors [6]. Among them, Capsaicin has been shown to
suppress cell proliferation and trigger apoptosis of Multiple
Myeloma (MM) cells, by reducing STAT3 phosphorylation
and activation [7]. The activation of STAT3 pathway,
mainly due to the effect of tumor-released factors, plays
indeed a critical role in cell survival and chemo-resistance
of MM as well as several other tumor cells [8–10]. STAT3
is constitutively activated also in Primary Effusion
Lymphoma (PEL) cells and its inhibition leads to apoptotic

immune-modulating properties, being able to activate DCs
through the vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1) [21] Moreover,
Capsaicin has given promising results in the activation of
antitumor immune response also in vivo, in animal models,
[22] although contradictory studies showing a negative
effect of Capsaicin on DCs have also been reported [23].
DCs play a pivotal role in the priming of immune response
against novel antigens and their activation is essential for
the complete tumor eradication, especially in the course of
the chemotherapeutic treatments [24, 25]. Thus, we next
investigated the effect of Capsaicin (at the same dose used
to kill PEL cells) on monocyte-derived DCs, and compared
its effect to that obtained by using lipolysaccharide (LPS),
the classical DC activator. Another important effect of
Capsaicin, observed in this study was its capacity to cause
a pre-apoptotic DAMP surface exposure in PEL cells
that may also indirectly lead to DC activation. PEL cells
release a variety of cytokines and soluble factors that,
besides promoting tumor cell survival, impair monocyte
differentiation into functional DCs [26]. So, we finally
evaluated if Capsaicin would be able to counteract
such immune-suppressive effect and rescue monocyte
differentiation into DCs. A treatment like Capsaicin, having
the capacity to induce an immunogenic cell death in tumor
cells, to activate the immune system and to counteract the
tumor-mediated immune-suppression may allow to obtain
the goals of an ideal anticancer therapy.

cells treated with Capsaicin for 12 hours (Figure 1E). All
together these results indicate that Capsaicin induces an
immunogenic apoptosis in PEL cells.

RESULTS

Capsaicin induces caspase-dependent Mcl-1
cleavage and cell death similarly to AG490
STAT3 inhibitor

Capsaicin inhibits STAT3 constitutive activation
in PEL cells
Since PEL cells relay on the constitutive activation
of STAT3 for their survival, we next investigated if
Capsaicin impairment of PEL cell survival would correlate
with a reduction of the STAT3 phosphorylation, as
previously demonstrated in MM [7]. At this aim, both BC3
and BCBL1 cells were treated with Capsaicin for 24 hours
and, as shown in Figure 2A, Capsaicin (200 μM) strongly
suppressed STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. The STAT3
de-phosphorylating effect mediated by Capsaicin was
similar to the effect obtained by treating PEL cells with
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG490 (Figure
2B). Capsaicin-induced STAT3 de-phosphorylation was
reverted by the broad-acting tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor
sodium orthovanadate (OV) [27] (Figure 2C), indicating
that tyrosine phosphatases play a major role in capsaicinmediated STAT3 de-phosphorylation. OV treatment also
reduced the cytotoxic effect mediated by Capsaicin against
BCBL1 PEL cells (Figure 2D), suggesting that STAT3
de-phosphorylation was involved in the Capsaicinmediated cytotoxic effect.

Capsaicin induces an immunogenic apoptotic
cell death in PEL cells

To further demonstrate that Capsaicin mediated
cell death correlated with STAT3 de-phosphorylation,
we compared its effect with the effect mediated by
AG490 STAT3 inhibitor. Since STAT3 inhibition has
been previously reported to reduce the expression of the
anti-apoptotic molecule Mcl-1, [28] its expression level
was evaluated in BC3 PEL cells treated with Capsaicin
or AG490. We found that both treatments, besides
reducing the expression level of Mcl-1, induced the
appearance of its cleaved pro-apoptotic fragment [29]
(Figure 3A and 3B). Concomitantly, an increase of the
PARP-cleavage (Figure 3A and 3B) was observed in
BC3 cells treated with Capsaicin as well as with AG490.
We then investigated if, besides Mcl-1, another member
belonging to the same family, such as Bcl-xL, would be
affected by Capsaicin and/or AG490 and found that it
was slightly reduced by both treatments (Figure 3C and
3D). These results indicate that the reduction of Mcl-1
was a rather specific effect correlated with STAT3 dephosphorylation. Finally, we found that the reduction of
cell survival mediated by Capsaicin as well as by AG490
was reverted by z-VAD-fmk pan-caspase inhibitor
(Figure 3E), according to the caspase3 activation by both
treatments (Figure 3F).

BC3 and BCBL1 PEL cells were treated with
two different doses of Capsaicin (100 and 200 μM) for
24 hours and its effect on cell survival was assessed by
trypan-blue exclusion assay. We found that Capsaicin
reduced cell survival in a dose-dependent fashion, in both
PEL cell lines (Figure 1A). We then found that Capsaicin
induced an increase of the sub-G1 events (Figure 1B),
suggesting the occurrence of an apoptotic cell death.
To further confirm the apoptotic cell death, PEL cells
were treated with Capsaicin in the presence or in the
absence of z-VAD-fmk pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.
As shown in Figure 1C and 1D, z-VAD-fmk was able
to partially revert the percentage of sub-G1 cells as
well as the cell death, as indicated by optic microscopic
observations. From the immunogenic point of view,
an apoptotic cell death can be immunogenic or not
immunogenic, depending on its ability to induce the
surface exposure of Damage Associated Molecular
Patterns (DAMPs) such as HSP90 and Calreticulin,
that in turn activate the immune system. So, we next
investigated whether Capsaicin would induce a preapoptotic DAMP exposure and found that HSP90 and
Calreticulin were detected on the cell surface of PEL

autophagy in PEL cells. Next, the role of autophagy
induced by Capsaicin in PEL cell survival was investigated
by inhibiting it with 3-MA or by silencing Beclin 1, an
essential autophagic gene. The results obtained, showing
that BCBL1 cell survival was reduced (Figure 4C) and
PARP cleavage increased in cells pre-treated with
3-MA (Figure 4D) or knockdown for Beclin 1 before
Capsaicin treatment (Figure 4E, 4F and 4G), indicate that
autophagy played a pro-survival role in PEL cells and that
its inhibition could be exploited to increase Capsaicin
cytotoxicity against these cells.

Mcl-1, besides having an anti-apoptotic role, also
inhibits autophagy by interacting with Beclin1 [18, 30].
Thus, we investigated if, in correlation to the Mcl-1
reduction, Capsaicin would lead to autophagy induction
in PEL cells. At this aim, the main autophagic markers
LC3I/II and p62 were analyzed by western blot. As shown
in Figure 4A, the lipidated form LC3 (LC3II) accumulated
in BCBL1 cells treated with Capsaicin in the presence
of Bafilomycin (Baf), an inhibitor of ATP vacuolase
that, by blocking LC3II degradation, allows to evaluate
LC3 formation and consequently the completeness of
the autophagic flux [31]. Conversely, we found that p62
decreased in cells treated with Capsaicin (Figure 4B),
further indicating that it was able to promote a complete

[32]. Even if Capsaicin was found to be able to induce in
PEL cells the exposure of HSP90 and Calreticulin, that in
turn may indirectly lead to DC activation (Figure 1E), we
next investigated the effect of Capsaicin on the DCs. At
this aim, immature DCs, obtained from monocytes after
6 days of in vitro differentiation were left untreated or
were exposed to Capsaicin (150 μM) for 24 hours, before
analysing the expression of the DC activation markers.
As positive control of DC activation, cells were treated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with LPS (100 ng/ml) for the same time. The results
shown in Figure 5 indicate that Capsaicin up-regulated
the expression of the activation and differentiation
markers CD86, CD80 and CD83, as evidenced by FACS
analysis. The results obtained strongly encourage the use
of Capsaicin as chemotherapeutic agent. These results
are in agreement with a previous study DCs reporting
that Capsaicin activated DCs through the vanilloid
receptor1 [21].

Capsaicin counteracts the immune-suppressive
effects on DCs mediated by PEL-conditioned
medium

in the presence of Capsaicin (Figure 6). Conversely, CD14,
retained by PEL supernatant, was down-regulated by the
Capsaicin treatment (Figure 6). These results suggest that
Capsaicin has the potential to counteract the inhibitory
effect on monocytes differentiation mediated by the PEL
released factors.

Finally, we asked if Capsaicin would be able to
counteract the inhibitory effect mediated by PEL supernatant
on monocyte differentiation into DCs, previously observed
[33]. At this purpose, monocytes, isolated from healthy
donors, were cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 for five days
with or without 20% of PEL supernatant in the presence
or in the absence of Capsaicin. We found that CD1a
expression, strongly reduced by the PEL released factors,
present in the PEL cell conditioned medium, was restored

[2]. STAT3 pathway, inhibited by Capsaicin treatment,
induces cell death in cancer cells resistant to conventional
chemotherapies, as for example MM and pancreatic cancer
[7, 36]. PEL is an aggressive B cell lymphoma associated
with KSHV, characterized by a low response to conventional
chemotherapies. It displays several similarities with MM,
being both characterized by a high level of protein synthesis,
cytokine release and by the reliance on the constitutive
activation of several pro-survival pathways, including
STAT3 [12–14, 37–39]. STAT3 activation depends on the
production of cytokines such as IL-6 produced by the tumor
itself or encoded by KSHV, [40] whose infection plays a
pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this lymphoma [41]. In
this study, we found that Capsaicin strongly reduced STAT3
phosphorylation leading to an apoptotic PEL cell death
and that its effect was similar to AG490 STAT3 specific
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitor. STAT3 inhibition by Capsaicin correlates with its
pro-death effect, as evidenced by the reversion of STAT3
phosphorylation and the rescue of cell survival by OV, a
tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Moreover we found that
Capsaicin as well as AG490 caused the reduction of the full
length Mcl-1 molecule and induced the appearance of its
apoptotic cleaved fragment. Mcl-1 belongs to Bcl2 family
proteins that, besides having anti-apoptotic functions [28]
is also involved in autophagy inhibition by interacting with
Beclin1 [30]. Mcl-1 reduction by Capsaicin could be one
of the underlying mechanisms leading to both induction of
apoptosis and autophagy in PEL cells. The evidence that
autophagy inhibition potentiated the Capsaicin-mediated
cytotoxic effect against PEL cells suggests that this strategy
could be exploited in PEL anti-cancer therapy. It has clearly
established that chemotherapies, even the most efficient in the

induction of cell death, are not able to completely eradicate a
tumor if they do not concomitantly stimulate the cooperation
of the immune system and/or counteract the tumor-mediated
immune suppression [25, 42]. The finding that Capsaicin
induced an immunogenic cell death, in agreement with
previous studies obtained in other tumor cells, [43, 44] that
Capsaicin directly activated DC and, more importantly, that
it counteracted the impairment of monocyte differentiation
into DC induced by the PEL released factors, [26] strongly
encourage its use in PEL anticancer therapy. In conclusion,
we found that at least four goals can be achieved by the use of
Capsaicin: 1) to exert a strong cytotoxic effect on PEL cells,
that could be further increased by autophagy inhibition, 2) to
induce the exposure DAMPs, suggesting the ability to induce
an immunogenic cell death 3) to directly activate DCs and 4)
last, but not least, to inhibit the immune suppression induced
by the PEL released factors. All together, the results obtained
in this study, together with the consideration that Capsaicin is
a natural product, indicate that Capsaicin could be a possible
candidate for an ideal anticancer therapy against PEL as well
as other cancers with similar characteristics.

Immature DC generation
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
healthy donors were isolated by Lympholyte cell separation
media (Cedarlane, CL5020). Monocytes were isolated by
immunomagnetic cell separation using anti-CD14-conjugated
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 1300-50-201). To induce the
differentiation of immature DCs (iDCs), monocytes were
cultured for 6 days with recombinant human granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)(50 ng/mL)
(Milteny Biotec, 130-093-865) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) (20
ng/mL) (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-095-373).

Cell viability
BC3 and BCBL1 cells were plated in 12-well plates
at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml and treated with capsaicin
(200 μM) (Sigma Aldrich, 1091108) or with AG490
(100 μM) for 24 hrs. Similarly, PEL cells were also
pretreated with Sodium Orthovanadate (OV) (100 μM)
(Sigma Aldrich, 450243) for 30 minutes and subsequently
cultured in medium containing capsaicin (200 μM) (Sigma

To also evaluate the impact of autophagy on cell
survival, a siRNA assay was performed. PEL cells
were cultured in 12-well plates at a density of 3 × 105
cells/ml in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS without
antibiotics. These cells, Beclin 1 knocked-down, were
then treated with Capsaicin (200 μM) (Sigma Aldrich,
1091108) for 24 hrs.
After each chemical treatment or RNA interference,
a trypan blue (Euroclone, 72571) exclusion assay was
performed to test cell viability. Live cells were counted by
light microscopy using a Neubauer hemocytometer.

Solution 29:1) (Biorad, 161-0159) in Tris-Glycine-SDS
buffer. Then, the gels were transferred to Nitrocellulose
Membranes (Biorad, Hercules, 162-0115) for 2 hrs in
Tris-Glycine. The membranes were blocked in PBS-0.1%
Tween20 solution containing 3% of BSA, probed with
specific antibodies and developed using ECL Blotting
Substrate (Advansta, K-12045-D20).

Apoptosis assay
Treated and untreated cells (5 × 105) were washed
in PBS 1X and resuspended in 300 μl hypotonic
fluorochrome solution [50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1%
sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton-X-100 and 100 U/ml RNase
A (all from Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature.
DNA content was measured by a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The mean frequencies of
apoptotic subG1 cells were calculated at least from three
independent experiments. The percentage of specific
apoptosis was calculated as follows: % specific apoptosis

Immunofluorescence
PEL cells were treated with Capsaicin (200 μM)
and the expression of surface calreticulin and HSP90
was analyzed 12 hrs later by flow cytometry using the
specific mAbs: anti-Calreticulin (Thermo Scientific,
PA3-900) and anti-HSP90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc., sc-59577).
The expression of surface CD86, CD83 and CD80
was analyzed in untreated and Capsaicin (150 μM) or LPS
(100 ng/ml, Sigma) treated immature DC cells (5 × 105)
using the following human conjugated antibodies: CD86
(Milteny Biotec, 130-094-878), CD83 (Milteny Biotec,
130-094-181), CD80 (Milteny Biotec, 130-097-202), and
the isotype control antibodies (Milteny Biotec, 130-092213 and 130-092-212).
To study the role of Capsaicin in monocyte
differentiation into DCs in the presence or absence of the
inhibitory PEL cell supernatant, the expression of surface
CD14 and CD1a was analyzed using human mAb antiCD14 (Milteny Biotec., 130-080-701) and mAb antiCD1a (BD Pharmingen, 555807)
