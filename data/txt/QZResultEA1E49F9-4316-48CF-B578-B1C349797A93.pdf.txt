Abstract
Chemotherapy has historically been thought to induce cancer cell death in an
immunogenically silent manner. However, recent studies have demonstrated that
therapeutic outcomes with specific chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. anthracyclines)
correlate strongly with their ability to induce a process of immunogenic cell death
(ICD) in cancer cells. This process generates a series of signals that stimulate the
immune system to recognize and clear tumor cells. Extensive studies have revealed
that chemotherapy-induced ICD occurs via the exposure/release of calreticulin
(CALR), ATP, chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) and high mobility
group box 1 (HMGB1). This review provides an in-depth look into the concepts and
mechanisms underlying CALR exposure, activation of the Toll-like receptor 3/IFN/
CXCL10 axis, and the release of ATP and HMGB1 from dying cancer cells. Factors that
influence the impact of ICD in clinical studies and the design of therapies combining
chemotherapy with immunotherapy are also discussed.

Introduction

based on morphological cell changes, chromatin
condensation, and membrane blebbing, and was thought
to occur in the absence of an inflammatory response.
Recently, a consensus has emerged recommending that
the nature of cell death should not simply be defined by
morphological changes, but rather by distinct molecular,
biochemical, and metabolic hallmarks [2, 4]. This has led
to the acceptance of a new apoptotic cell death modality
that elicits antigen specific immune responses against
dead-cell antigens [5]. This type of cell death has been
termed immunogenic cell death (ICD) and was initially
characterized in the context of anti-cancer chemotherapy
[6].
Unlike physiological cell death which induces
signals that lead to tolerogenic clearance of cells,
chemotherapy-induced cell death generates specific
changes in cell surface structures and release of soluble
mediators that allow dendritic cells (DCs) to detect the
dying cell and initiate an anti-tumor immune response

Historically, the anti-cancer benefits of
chemotherapies were considered to be a consequence
of direct cytotoxicity or permanent arrest of the cell
cycle machinery. These therapies were thought to nonspecifically target rapidly proliferating cells, leading to
the assumption that chemotherapies would inadvertently
target proliferating immune cells and result in
immunosuppression. Furthermore, chemotherapies were
thought to induce cell death in an immunologically silent
manner. This led many researchers to neglect the role of
the immune system in cytotoxic chemotherapy, and the
testing guidelines set by regulatory agencies recommended
the use of immunodeficient hosts for examination of drug
effects on cancer cells [1].
Regulated cell death is a physiological phenomenon
that plays an important role in development and
homeostasis [2, 3]. This process was initially characterized

processes is to re-establish homeostasis and promote
survival. However, when these coping mechanisms are
overwhelmed, the pro-survival mechanisms switch to prodeath signals [30]. This is accompanied by translocation
of danger signals to the cell surface and intrinsic
mitochondrial apoptosis [31-33]. CALR represents
the most abundant protein in the ER lumen and gets
translocated to the surface of stressed and dying cancer
cells [22, 34, 35]. This translocation of CALR occurs prior
to translocation of phophatidylserine (PS) to the outer
leaflet of the plasma membrane, hence it is termed a preapoptotic event [22, 34, 35]. The ecto-CALR serves as a
potent “eat me” signal for local patrolling DCs.
The UPR is activated by three distinct sensors:
the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) (an ER kinase
and endoribonuclease) [36, 37], activating transcription
factor 6 (ATF6) [38, 39] and PKC related kinase-like ER
kinase (PERK) (Figure 1) [40, 41]. Under homeostatic
conditions, the three UPR sensors are held in an inactive
state by the chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein
(BiP; also known as GRP78) [39, 42]. During stress,
BiP preferentially associates with misfolded proteins
to prevent them from aggregating, allowing the three
UPR sensors to be activated. Activated ATF6 dissociates
from the ER and translocates to the Golgi, where it is
cleaved. Cleaved ATF6 acts as a transcription factor and
translocates to the nucleus where it binds the ER stress
response element, a potent regulator of ER chaperone
levels [38]. Activation of PERK leads to attenuation
of global protein translation via phosphorylation and
inhibition of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor
2α (eIF2α) [41]. However, phospho-eIF2α does not inhibit
the translation of activation transcription factor 4 (ATF4),
which is a potent transcription factor for genes involved
in amino acid metabolism and transport, oxidationreduction reactions, and apoptosis [40, 43, 44]. Activated
IRE1 has endoribonucleolytic activity that splices X-box
binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA [45]. The spliced
XBP1 transcript is translated and XBP1 translocates to
the nucleus where it controls the expression of genes
promoting expansion of the ER membrane, protein folding,
and degradation of proteins [46]. Unfolded proteins are
normally retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm, where they
are ubiquitinated and degraded via the proteasome. Cells
deficient in IRE1 or XBP1 are defective in ER associated
protein degradation [47].
Although all three branches of the UPR are activated
by general stress events, the timing, duration and signaling
strength of each pathway may vary [48]. Activation of all
three branches of the UPR has been described in cancer
cells responding to cardiac glycosides in vitro [49].
However, inhibition of IRE1 and ATF6 does not affect
the expression of ecto-CALR on the plasma membrane
[16], suggesting that PERK activity is the key UPR sensor
involved in chemotherapy induced ICD. Activated PERK
is considered a classical precursor for ICD-associated

[7]. During this process, DCs engulf parts of the stressed/
dying cell and incorporate antigenic peptides into MHCs
for presentation to T cells. In contrast to tolerogenic cell
clearance, it is essential that DCs engulfing dying cells
also receive maturation signals via cytokines or Tolllike receptor (TLR) signaling in order to activate T cells
optimally and prevent the development of tolerance [810].
While many chemotherapeutics do not elicit ICD
(e.g. etoposide, mitomycin C, cisplatin), some agents
(including anthracyclines and oxaliplatin) have been
shown to cause ICD [6, 11-14]. Additional therapeutic
modalities that have been shown to induce ICD include
radiation therapy [15, 16], oncolytic virus therapy [17,
18] and photodynamic therapy [19]. This review will
focus on mechanisms of chemotherapy induced ICD. The
only way to identify bona fide ICD inducers is through
vaccination challenges [20]; tumor cells treated with
ICD inducers prior to inoculation into immunocompetent
mice protect mice from subsequent challenge with the
same tumor [6, 11, 21, 22]. After screening for proteins
that are upregulated on the surface of cancer cells
undergoing ICD, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein
calreticulin (CALR) exhibited increased translocation to
the plasma membrane [22]. The exposed CALR (ectoCALR) was found to be critical for ICD as knockdown
of CALR expression significantly hampered anti-tumor
immunity [16, 22]. Following the pre-apoptotic ectoCALR mobilization, cells undergoing ICD release ATP,
which is essential for recruitment of antigen presenting
cells (APCs) and the subsequent activation of the
inflammasome to promote IL-1β release by DCs [12, 21,
23-25]. Anthracycline treated cancer cells also upregulate
a TLR3/ type I IFN/ chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10
(CXCL10) signaling cascade that results in protection
from tumor growth [26]. In the late stages of apoptosis
(secondary necrosis), cells passively release high-mobility
group box 1 (HMGB1) which signals via TLR4 on DCs to
enhance antigen presentation [11, 27, 28]. These processes
are discussed in detail below.

ER stress and CALR exposure
The ER serves as a site for protein folding,
modification, and trafficking. In addition, the ER is
also the primary site for lipid biosynthesis and calcium
storage. Physiologic stress such as increased secretory
load, or pathologic stresses such as mutated proteins, can
overwhelm the functional capacity of the ER, leading to
ER stress [29]. The ER responds to stress by activating an
adaptive mechanism called the unfolded protein response
(UPR) [29]. The UPR evokes coping mechanisms such
as expansion of the ER, attenuation of protein translation,
reduced translocation of proteins to the ER, increased
synthesis of chaperones, and increased protein degradation
via the 26S proteasome [29]. The main purpose of these

ecto-CALR expression in vitro [16, 19] and ICD in vivo
[16], but activation of PERK alone does not always result
in increased ecto-CALR [50]. This suggests that ER stress
is required, but not sufficient, to induce ICD-associated
translocation of CALR to the cell surface.
Optimal functioning of ER proteins requires
a calcium rich ER environment. There is increasing
evidence to suggest calcium leakage from the ER is
necessary for ER stress and subsequent surface exposure
of CALR [19, 49, 51]. Calcium ionophores mimic the
CALR-exposing activity of cardiac glycosides, whose
action is blocked by calcium chelators [49]. Reactive
oxygen species (ROS) have also been shown to be critical
for anthracycline-induced ICD, since treatment with
N-acetylcysteine reduced the translocation of CALR
to the plasma membrane [16]. However, ROS alone are

not sufficient to induce ICD. The direct link between ER
stress and ROS in chemotherapy-induced ICD has not
been clearly elucidated. Some authors have proposed
that ROS generated in the ER lumen is not sufficient to
initiate oxidative stress [52, 53]. Intriguingly, calcium
leakage from the ER could provide the missing link
between ER stress and ROS in chemotherapy-induced
ICD. Indeed, calcium release by the ER has been shown
to increase mitochondrial calcium loading [54], which
activates the Krebs cycle [55, 56], and subsequently
promotes generation of ROS from the mitochondrial
electron transport chain [57-59]. It is likely that the
calcium driven mitochondrial ROS, together with ER
lumen generated ROS, may reach the critical threshold
required for ICD. In turn, ROS can further increase
calcium release by sensitizing ER calcium channels [60].

Figure 1: Schematic of the unfolded protein response. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers PERK activation. Activated

PERK attenuates protein biosynthesis by phosphorylating eIF2α which halts global translation, but leads to activation of ATF4. ER stress
also triggers IRE1α activation which initiates the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, producing an active transcription factor, sXBP1. This leads to
the expression of chaperone proteins and proteins involved in protein degradation. In addition, ER stress also activates ATF6 which also
increases chaperone synthesis to alleviate ER stress.

The positive feedback loop between elevated calcium
and increased ROS production may exacerbate ER stress,
and could ultimately drive the pre-apoptotic events of
ICD. This might explain why disrupting this vicious
cycle using either calcium chelators or N-acetylcysteine
prevents chemotherapy-induced ICD [16, 49]. To the
best of our knowledge, no study has demonstrated the
direct link between calcium dysregulation and ROS in
chemotherapy-induced ICD, and it is possible that other
unknown mechanisms may exist.
Once ER stress has overwhelmed the adaptive
capabilities of the UPR, the “pre-apoptotic module” of the
CALR exposure pathway is initiated [16]. ER stress can
induce apoptosis via several mechanisms [61], however,
only caspase-8-mediated activation has been shown to
be essential for ICD [16]. Interestingly, the mechanism
of caspase-8 activation in chemotherapy induced ICD
remains unknown [16]. Shiga toxin 1-induced ER stress
promotes calcium release from ER stores and subsequently
leads to the activation of the calcium-dependent protease
calpain [62], which leads to caspase-8-mediated cell death.
Therefore, it is possible that calpain may be the protease
responsible for activating caspase-8 during chemotherapyinduced ICD. Activated caspase-8 subsequently cleaves B
cell receptor associated protein 31 (Bap31), an ER-sessile
protein [63]. This cleavage generates a pro-apoptotic p20
fragment that interacts with the apoptosis regulator Bcl2

(B cell lymphoma 2) to release sequestered Bax (Bcl2associated protein x) and Bak (Bcl2 agonist killer 1) [16,
63, 64] (Figure 2). Bax and Bak oligomerize to initiate
irreversible events that disrupt mitochondrial permeability,
leading to cytochrome c release and subsequent cell death.
Bap31 is also a calcium gatekeeper, and cleavage of Bap31
allows leakage of calcium into the cytoplasm, which may
further enhance Bax/Bak oligomerization and cytochrome
c release [53, 63]. It is important to note that translocation
of CALR occurs prior to cleavage of caspase-3 (a
terminal event in the intrinsic apoptosis cascade) [16].
Hence CALR translocation is an early event that requires
activation of caspase-8 but precedes downstream
apoptotic events. Pharmacologic inhibition of caspase-8,
or replacement of Bap31 with a non-cleavable mutant,
inhibited CALR exposure induced by anthracyclines or
oxaliplatin [16]. Similarly, knocking out/down Bax or Bak
prevents CALR translocation [16]. Therefore strategies
that enhance this apoptotic module may also enhance
ICD. Once the ER stress response and the subsequent preapoptotic module are complete, the translocation of CALR
to the cell surface is initiated. A direct interaction between
CALR and ERp57, an ER chaperone that plays important
roles in protein folding, MHC loading and quality control
of glycoproteins, was shown to be required for the CALR
translocation to the cell surface [16]. This process involves
actin cytoskeleton-mediated anterograde transport of

Figure 2: Schematic of the apoptotic module in ICD. Unresolved ER stress, calcium dysregulation and elevated levels of reactive

oxygen species (ROS) lead to the activation of caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 subsequently cleaves Bap31 to generate a pro-apoptotic p20
fragment. Bap31-p20 interacts with Bcl2, causing its dissociation from Bax and Bak. This allows for the oligomerization of Bax and Bak,
leading to disruption in mitochondrial permeability, cytochrome c release and subsequent cell death. The formation of Bap31-p20 fragment
also further perturbs calcium homeostasis.

CALR from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, and subsequent
active exocytosis of CALR-containing vesicles [16].
Vesicle associated SNAREs (solubleN-ethylmaleimidesensitive factorattachment proteinreceptors) (e.g. VAMP1) and plasma membrane associated SNAREs (e.g. SNAP
23/25) have been shown to be critical for CALR exposure
[16].
Extracellular and surface-exposed CALR binds to
several cell surface receptors including CD69, CD91,
complement component C1q and mannose binding
lectin [65]. Ecto-CALR functions as a potent “eat me”
signal on apoptotic cells through the binding of CD91
on macrophages and DCs [66]. Similar to CALR,
phosphatidylserine (PS) also serves as an “eat me” signal
on apoptotic cells, but CALR exposure precedes that of
PS [22]. In contrast to CALR, PS mediates clearance of
tumor cells without activating an immune response [67].
PS exposure on cancer cells has also been associated with

immunosuppression, and antibody-mediated inhibition of
PS significantly improves anti-tumor immune responses
[68, 69]. CALR binds CD91 on APCs to promote proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6 and tumor necrosis
factor) [70, 71]. Hence, recognition of CALR on dying
cells is an early event that leads to engulfment of dying
tumor cells by APCs and promotes priming of the adaptive
immune response. In addition to the “eat me” signals on
dying tumor cells, co-stimulatory DAMPs are required to
generate an effective anti-tumor immune response (most
commonly ATP and HMGB1).

The role of ATP in ICD
ATP has been widely studied for its role in energy
metabolism and autocrine/paracrine cell signaling.
Although ATP has a physiologic role in neurotransmission,
it can also be released from cells during pathological

Figure 3: Schematic representation of therapy-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD). Chemotherapy-induced ER stress,
autophagy, TLR3 activation and HMGB1 release are key events in immunogenic cell death. Unresolved ER stress leads to the activation
of the unfolded protein response, initiation of the pre-apoptotic module and subsequent translocation of CALR. CALR is a potent “eat me”
signal for infiltrating DCs. Autophagy plays an important role in accumulation of ATP in phagolysosomes and ATP potently activates the
NLRP3/inflammasome pathway in DCs. Following activation of the inflammasome, DCs secrete IL-1β that is essential in the recruitment
of γδ T cells and IFN-γ+ cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Activation of TLR3 in dying cancer cells also leads to autocrine/paracrine type I IFN
production and the subsequent production of CXCL10. This is followed by the release of HMGB1 during the late stages of apoptosis.

conditions such as mechanical stress, plasma membrane
damage, hypoxia and exposure to cytotoxic agents
[72]. Multiple distinct ICD inducers (oxaliplatin,
mitoxanthrone, doxorubicin) can cause ATP release from
dying tumor cells [21, 72]. Although ATP release could
occur through multiple mechanisms, autophagy is thought
to be the primary mechanism that sustains high ATP levels
in cells undergoing ICD [12].
Currently, it is not clear how autophagy is initiated
in chemotherapy-induced ICD. ER stress is initiated early
following exposure to inducers of ICD and failure of the
UPR results in accumulation of unfolded proteins. Usually
the proteasomal pathway is involved in degradation of
short-lived proteins [73], whereas the autophagy process
is involved in breaking down long-lived or aggregated
proteins [74]. In the case where the UPR/proteasomal
pathway is overwhelmed by the accumulation of misfolded
proteins, excess proteins may form aggregates that trigger
autophagy. ER stress can also directly promote autophagy.
During ER stress, IRE1 signals through TRAF-2 to
activate c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and subsequently
phosphorylate Bcl2 [33]. This promotes the dissociation
of Beclin-1 from Bcl2, an important step in progression
of autophagy. In addition, ER stress can also directly
regulate the transcription of autophagy related genes [75].
Following ER stress, activation of eIF2α/ATF4 pathway
increases the transcription of genes implicated in the
formation, elongation and function of the autophagosome
(Atg16l1,Map1lc3b,Atg12, Atg3,Becn1,andGabarapl2)
[75-78]. Alternatively, activation of the eIF2α/ATF4
pathway can also upregulate the expression of stressregulated protein p8 (also known as candidate of
metastasis-1) and its downstream target, pseudokinase
Tribbles homologue 3 (TRB3) [79, 80]. TRB3 is a known
activator of autophagy via inhibition of the Akt/mTOR
complex 1 (mTORc1) [33, 80]. Other mechanisms of ER
stress-mediated autophagy induction have been reviewed
elsewhere [81], however to the best of our knowledge,
no study has shown these interactions in the context of
chemotherapy-induced ICD. Taken together, ER stresses
can upregulate autophagy via multiple independent
mechanisms. We hypothesize that in the early stages of
ICD, autophagy might be intervening to try and relieve
ER stress. In the event that both UPR and autophagy
fail to rescue the cell, it is possible that both pathways
work together to enhance ICD. If this is true, it suggests a
certain threshold or point of no return for the cell exists,
perhaps linked to mitochondrial permeability.
Autophagy is a catabolic process that results in bulk
degradation of cytoplasmic contents, abnormal protein
aggregates, and excess or damaged organelles [82].
Autophagy cargo is sequestered into double-membraned
compartments (called autophagosomes) that fuse with
lysosomes to degrade their contents and generate raw
materials and energy. Although ATP release from cells
could occur through multiple mechanisms, autophagy has
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been shown to be important for optimal release of ATP
from dying cells [12]. In a series of elegant experiments,
Martins et al. [83] demonstrated that pre-apoptotic
autophagy is essential in promoting the accumulation of
ATP in LAMP1+ (Lysosomal-associated membrane protein
1) autolysosomes. However, subsequent translocation of
LAMP1+ vesicles to the plasma membrane and release
of ATP are autophagy independent. The secretion of ATP
during ICD was dependent on caspase-mediated opening
of pannexin 1 channels. Importantly, autophagy and
LAMP1 failed to influence pannexin 1 channel opening,
but pannexin 1 was indispensable for the translocation
of LAMP1 to the plasma membrane. Hence, it appears
that autophagy is the means by which ATP levels
concentrate in LAMP1+ lysosomal vesicles, and caspase/
pannexin-1 dependent lysosomal exocytosis are key in
the subsequent release of ATP by cells undergoing ICD
[83, 84]. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic targeting
of key components of the autophagosome such as Atg5,
Atg7 or Beclin-1 led to a significant reduction in ATP
release and limited the immunogenicity of dying cancer
cells [12]. Tumor cells deficient in autophagy and ATP
production exhibited impaired recruitment of monocytes,
macrophages and dendritic cells following therapy [12].
Local injections of ectonucleotidase inhibitors (that
block ATP degradation) into tumors was sufficient to
rescue extracellular ATP levels, enhance DC and T cell
infiltration, and improve chemotherapeutic outcomes [12].
This suggests that the process of autophagy is dispensable,
and any source of ATP is sufficient to rescue ICD.
Extracellular ATP has the dual effect of attracting
immune cells and activating the inflammasome pathway.
ATP signaling via P2Y2 receptors on monocytes and DCs
induces their recruitment and differentiation in the tumor
microenvironment [85-87]. Once naïve immune cells are
recruited to tumor sites and have been exposed to “eat
me” signals, they require activation signals to increase
their anti-tumor activities. ATP signaling via P2RX7
receptors is one of the most potent activators of the
NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in DCs and macrophages
[85, 88, 89]. Although P2RX7 is expressed on several cell
types, ATP primarily acts through P2RX7 on DCs during
ICD [21]. The NLRP3 pathway activates the protease
caspase-1, which leads to the processing and secretion
of mature pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-18 [89].
Supporting a key role for the ATP/NLRP3 inflammasome
in response to chemotherapy, Ghringhelli et al. [21]
demonstrated that P2RX7-/-, NLRP3-/-, Caspase- 1-/-, and
IL-1R-/- mice had significantly decreased chemotherapeutic
protection against EG7 lymphoma, CT26 colorectal
carcinoma and MCA205 fibrosarcoma. Furthermore, using
anti-IL-1β blocking antibodies, chemotherapy induced
IL-1β was shown to be required for the recruitment of
IL-17-producing γδ T cells [87] and generation of IFN-γproducing tumor-specific CD8 T cells [21]. Interestingly,
the recruitment of γδ T cells and production of IL-17

occurred prior to tumor-specific IFN-γ production by
CD8 T cells [87]. Therefore mice lacking γδ T cells, IL17 or IL-17R failed to recruit IFN-γ-producing CD8 T
cells. Hence ATP release following cytotoxic therapy can
mediate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, creating
a link between the innate and adaptive immune response.
In particular, activation of the inflammasome in DCs leads
to the production of IL-1β and subsequent recruitment
of γδ T cells and priming of CD8 T cells against tumor
antigens (Figure 3).

and is required for full induction of type I IFN in antiviral immune responses [94, 95]. While TLR3 agonists
have been shown to cause cell death in pancreatic β cells
[96, 97], endothelial cells [98], and cancer cells [99], a
novel role of anthracycline induced TLR3 activation
has been recently described in ICD [26]. TIR domaincontaining adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF), the only
known adaptor protein of TLR3 signaling, can by itself
exhibit pro-apoptotic properties [100-102]. Sistigu et
al. [26] demonstrated that anthracyclines elicit aTLR3
signaling cascade in cancer cells that leads to autocrine/
paracrine type I IFN signaling and the subsequent
secretion of CXCL10 (Figure 4). Genetically knocking
out TLR3 or the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) in cancer cells
ablated this protection, an effect that could be reversed
by administering recombinant type I IFN or CXCL10 in
the respective knockouts [26]. This cascade was essential
for the successful vaccination of mice against tumor
rechallenge. Consistent with this, a type I IFN signature

The role of TLR3 and type-I IFN
in ICD
Ligation of TLRs by microbial ligands is known
to trigger well characterized signaling cascades that
result in anti-microbial immune responses [90], and
occasionally, death of the infected cells [91-93]. TLR3 is
a key endosomal pathogen recognition receptor for dsRNA

TLR4-/- mice but not wild type mice [11]. This suggests
that TLR4 signaling in DCs and not the specific TLR4
ligand produced by dying tumor cell is important for
inducing ICD.
Although chemotherapy-induced HMGB1/TLR4
signaling has primarily been associated with anti-tumor
immune responses, HMGB1 has also been shown to
promote cancer regrowth and metastasis in cells that
survived chemotherapy [120, 121]. Blocking RAGEHMGB1 interactions significantly reduced tumor burden
in both spontaneous and implanted tumor models [121].
Similarly, HMGB1 has been shown to mediate colitisassociated tumors, which can be decreased in incidence
and size by anti-HMGB1 antibody treatment [122]. The
necrotic cells arising from dextran sulfate sodium-induced
colitis may account for the high levels of HMGB1. This
pro-tumorigenic role of HMGB1 may be linked to chronic
inflammation, which has been associated with tumor
development and progression [123]. However, HMGB1
may also have direct deleterious effects on anti-cancer
therapy. HMGB1 can directly inhibit the efficacy of DNA
vaccines and chemotherapy by interacting with T cell
immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3
(TIM-3) on DCs and inhibiting the uptake of nucleic acids
into endosomes [124].
These conflicting roles of HMGB1 could be
attributed to the ability of HMGB1 to switch among
mutually exclusive oxidative states (Figure 5). HMGB1
contains three conserved cysteine residues that are
sensitive to oxidation; Cys23, Cys45 and Cys106 [125].
When all three cysteine residues on HMGB1 are reduced,
HMGB1 binds CXCR4 and acts as a chemoattractant.
Formation of a disulfide bond between Cys23 and Cys45
leads to the preferential binding to TLR4 and induces
pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Further ROSmediated oxidation of all three cysteine residues to
sulfonates abrogates both activities [126]. Terminally
oxidized HMGB1 is associated with increased resistance
to chemotherapy [108, 127]. The mechanism by
which HMGB1 redox state is regulated in the tumor
microenvironment remains unknown, and it is possible
that these changes occur either prior to HMGB1 release
from the dying cell or following the release of HMGB1
into the tumor microenvironment.

is a strong prognostic factor for breast cancer patients
undergoing anthracycline therapy [26]. The availability of
clinical grade TLR3 agonists [103], recombinant type I
IFNs [104], and pre-clinical recombinant CXCL10 [105]
provide promising avenues for targeted cancer therapies.

The role of HMGB1 in ICD	
HMGB1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that
plays an important role in stabilizing nucleosomes,
regulating gene transcription, and DNA repair [106, 107].
In addition to its role in the nucleus, extracellular HMGB1
has key roles in inflammation, cell differentiation, cell
migration, and tumor metastasis [108]. HMGB1 is actively
secreted by macrophages [109], DCs [110], and NK cells
[111] in response to infection or injury. Secreted HMGB1
can promote inflammation by binding the receptor for
advanced glycation end products (RAGE), TLR2, TLR4
and TLR9, whereas HMGB1 pro-inflammatory activity
can be inhibited by binding CD24 [112-115]. When bound
to nucleosomes, HMGB1 can induce a TLR2 mediated
humoral responses against the released DNA/histones
[116]. HMGB1 can also associate with the chemokine
CXCL12 and recruit immune cells to sites of inflammation
[117].
Although early reports suggested that HMGB1 was
only released from necrotic cells [114], there is increasing
evidence showing that HMGB1 can be released during
the late stages of apoptosis [115, 118]. In particular, the
release of HMGB1 was shown to be required for effective
induction of ICD [11]. In this study, the authors vaccinated
mice with anthracycline- or oxaliplatin-treated cells one
week prior to tumor challenge and demonstrated that
antibody mediated blockade of HMGB1 compromised
the efficacy of vaccination. Furthermore, protection
in MyD88 and TLR4-deficient mice (but not other
TLR-deficient mice) was also compromised using this
vaccination strategy. These results implicate TLR4 as the
receptor for HMGB1 that mediates anti-tumor immune
responses via chemotherapy-induced ICD. The activation
of TLR4 on DCs in culture was shown to enhance
the processing of phagocytic cargo, facilitate antigen
presentation, upregulate co-stimulatory molecules and
increase intracellular levels of pro-IL-1β (a substrate for
the inflammasome pathway) [7, 11, 72]. TLR4 signaling
might also prevent the premature lysosomal degradation
of engulfed apoptotic debris and potentially preserve
tumor-associated antigens for presentation [11, 119].
This is consistent with the observation that peptides
that are resistant to lysosomal degradation are more
antigenic [119]. Tumor cells deficient in HMGB1 exhibit
compromised capacity to induce ICD and anti-tumor
immune responses, however, TLR4 agonists rescued the
chemotherapy-induced anti-tumor immune responses
[27]. Similarly, inhibition of lysosomal degradation using
chloroquine enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy in

Considerations for ICD in cancer

These
emerging
concepts
surrounding
chemotherapy-induced ICD bring promises, questions,
challenges, and opportunities that need to be further
investigated to enhance potential clinical benefit. In
particular, the concepts underlying ICD could play an
important role in patient-specific chemotherapy selection,
tumor-specific therapeutic strategies or dose/sequence
selection. In recent years, immune modulation therapy

has gained traction as an emerging standard of care
for many types of cancers. Strategies for combining
immunotherapies with ICD-inducing chemotherapies
could potentially lead to enhanced efficacy and diminished
toxicities associated with current therapeutic strategies.
However, there are currently no well-established protocols
for combining immune modulation therapy with ICDinducing chemotherapies. Several factors that should be
considered when combining immunotherapy with ICDinducing chemotherapy are outlined below.

expression in tumors is associated with disease progression
[27] and poor survival [143]. In addition, breast cancer
patients with a loss-of-function single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly)
were more susceptible to relapse from anthracycline
based therapy [11]. Similarly, a TLR4 gene loss-offunction SNP (Thr399Ile) in patients with head and neck
cancers [144] or colorectal cancers [28] was associated
with worse overall survival following anthracycline and
oxaliplatin based therapies, respectively. Breast cancer
patients responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
epirubicin/docetaxel had higher levels of plasma HMGB1
compared to patients who did not respond to therapy
[145]. Therefore, deficiencies in HMGB1 or mutations
in TLR4 can be an independent predictive factor for
therapeutic success, and perhaps these patients could
benefit from combination therapies that overcome these
defects. As mentioned earlier, the deficiency in antigen
cross-presentation and lack of ICD response in TLR4/mice could be rescued by systemic administration of
chloroquine [11]. Addition of chloroquine to conventional
chemotherapy and radiotherapy was shown to improve
the mid-term survival of glioblastoma patients [146].
However, the HMGB1/TLR4 status of these patients was
not examined in the study.
The clinical relevance of ATP/P2RX7 is
best depicted by a loss of function SNP in P2RX7
(Glu496Ala) which lowers the affinity for ATP [147]. This
polymorphism decreases ATP mediated IL-1β release by
human monocytes, indicative of impaired inflammasome
activation [147]. P2RX7 (Glu496Ala) mutations in
breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline therapy
were associated with significantly lower metastasis free
survival compared to patients bearing normal P2RX7
alleles [21]. This is consistent with the pre-clinical
observations that disrupting ATP/P2RX7 signaling may
affect anthracycline induced ICD and impair response to
therapy. Local administration of recombinant IL-1β and
IL-12 fully restored anti-tumor T cell responses in P2RX7/, NLRP3-/- and Caspase-1-/- mice [21], suggesting that the
use of biologics may potentially benefit patients that have
defects in these pathways. Although ATP release by dying
cells is thought to be derived from autophagy mediated
accumulation in lysosomes, ATP levels in the tumor
microenvironment can also be influenced by the rate of
ATP degradation. Extracellular ATP degradation occurs
through ectonucleotidases such as CD39 and CD73. CD39
degrades ATP to ADP and AMP, whereas CD73 processes
AMP to immunosuppressive adenosine [148]. The role
of CD39 and CD73 in tumor progression was illustrated
by the development of resistance to immunotherapy and
chemotherapy in tumor cells transfected with CD39 or
CD73 [12, 149]. In line with this, high expression of
CD39 and CD73 was correlated with a poor prognosis in
leukemia [150] and colorectal carcinoma [151]. However,
CD39 and CD73 expression on immune cells has also

CALR “eat me” vs CD47 “don’t eat
me” signals
In non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients receiving
autologous DCs loaded with tumor cell antigens (generated
by heat shock or irradiation), levels of CALR exposure on
cancer cells provided an independent prognostic marker
[13]. Similarly, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients
receiving anthracycline therapy, the ability of autologous
T cells to produce an antigen-specific IFN-γ response was
strongly correlated with the tumor associated ER stress
(measured by phospho-eIF2α) and ecto-CALR expression
[128]. Chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin fail to trigger
CALR exposure due to the inability to induce ER stress,
but co-administration of ER stressors such as thapsigargin
or tunicamycin can correct this defect [28, 30, 129131]. Patients who receive bona fide ICD inducers and
fail to upregulate CALR or patients receiving non-ICDinducing chemotherapies such as cisplatin may potentially
benefit from a combination therapy with ER stressors or
administration of exogenous recombinant CALR [16, 22,
131, 132]. However, expression of ecto-CALR alone is
not sufficient to promote clearance of dying cells, since it
is also important that the “don’t eat me” signals mediated
by CD47 are absent or inhibited [128, 133]. CD47 is a
ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that binds
to SIRPα (signal regulatory protein α) on phagocytic cells,
including macrophages and DCs [134, 135], initiating a
cell signaling cascade that inhibits phagocytosis [136,
137]. Cancer cells appear to upregulate CD47 as a
mechanism of immune evasion [138-140]. Indeed,
elevated CD47 expression is strongly correlated with
resistance to anti-cancer therapy [141]. Antibody-mediated
blockade of CD47 was shown to increase macrophagemediated phagocytosis of leukemia and solid tumor cells
in vitro and reduce tumor burden and enhance survival in
vivo [140, 142]. Therefore, combining CD47 blockade
with ICD inducers may theoretically enhance therapeutic
outcomes.

undifferentiated myeloid cells [159]. MDSCs can directly
suppress T cell responses, and indirectly promote immune
suppression through the induction of FoxP3+ regulatory
T cells (Tregs) [160-164]. Given that the benefits of ICD
require antigen presentation by DCs and a functional
T cell response [6, 12, 21, 22, 26, 165], patients that
have suppressed immune systems may exhibit reduced
responses to chemotherapeutics that induce ICD. These
patients may benefit from combination therapies that
combine inducers of ICD with immunostimulation
or targeting of immunosuppressive populations. One
potential strategy would be to combine ICD inducers with
immunostimulatory antibodies that directly modulate
immune functions by enhancing stimulatory signals or
blocking inhibitory signals. These include anti-CTLA-4
(antagonizes cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) [166],
anti-PD1 (blocks programmed death protein 1) [167],
anti-TIM3 (blocks T cell immunoglobulin and mucin
domain-containing protein 3) [168], CD40 agonists
[169] and OX40 agonists [170, 171]. Although a detailed
description of these agents is beyond the scope of this
review, several pre-clinical studies have demonstrated
enhanced protection when these compounds were
combined with cyclophosphamide [172, 173], a known
inducer of ICD. An alternative approach would be
to use immunostimulatory cytokines to complement
ICD inducing chemotherapies. Oxaliplatin used in
combination with IL-12 was able to eradicate pre-existing
metastatic colorectal cancer and protect from tumor
recurrence in a murine model [174]. This combination
strategy was shown to significantly increase the ratio of
CD8 T cells/Tregs and the ratio of CD8 T cells/MDSCs
within the tumors. In addition to ICD-inducing activity,
doxorubicin has been shown to directly deplete and/or
impair the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs [175].
Paradoxically, some chemotherapies that induce ICD
can also induce suppressor cells that can inhibit immune
responses [176-178]. Therefore, the immunological profile
of the patient receiving ICD-inducing chemotherapy needs
to be taken into consideration when designing a patient’s
chemo-immunotherapy treatment.
The immune system is not exempt from the potential
cytotoxicity or cytostatic effects of chemotherapy.
Understanding
how
different
chemotherapies
directly influence the immune system, may enable
us to strategically target tumor cells and manipulate
the immune response. Cytotoxic chemotherapy (at
high doses) is generally non-specific and targets all
proliferating cells, including lymphocytes. While longterm lymphodepletion may be detrimental [179], shortterm lymphodepletion may have beneficial effects in
cancer therapy [180-182]. First, lymphodepletion results
in the elimination of immunosuppressive cells such as
Tregs, which have been shown to inhibit anti-tumor
immune responses and promote peripheral tolerance
[183]. Second, lymphodepletion triggers a resetting of

been shown promote tumor immune escape [149, 152].
Mice deficient in CD39 and CD73 showed enhanced antitumor NK cell [152], and CD8 T cell responses [149],
respectively. Collectively, these studies either directly
or indirectly implicate a protective role of ATP in tumor
control, and suggest that strategies to enhance ATP levels
in the tumor microenvironment might enhance therapeutic
outcomes. In addition, screening cancer patients for SNPs
in TLR4 and P2RX7 could help identify patients who
may benefit from additional therapeutic interventions to
overcome these mutations.

Microbiome
There is increasing evidence to implicate the
microbiome in many physiological processes, and
microbial dysbiosis is associated with pathological
outcomes [153]. In particular, the gut microbiome can
directly influence cancer therapy by regulating host
innate and adaptive immune responses [154, 155].
Germ-free mice or mice pre-treated with antibiotics
exhibit significantly reduced responses to anti-cancer
chemotherapy [154, 155]. Oxaliplatin, a known inducer
of ICD, was shown to eradicate most subcutaneous EL-4
tumors and prolong survival in normal mice, but not in
antibiotic treated or germ-free mice [154]. Similarly,
cyclophosphamide was shown to protect mice from
tumors by disrupting the integrity of the gut mucosa,
resulting in colonization of secondary lymphoid organs
by Gram-positive bacteria and a subsequent Th17dependent anti-tumor response [155]. Antibiotic therapy
was shown to significantly hamper the protective effects of
cyclophosphamide. In addition to influencing the adaptive
immune response, commensal microorganisms may play
a role in the enhancement/inhibition of chemotherapy
induced TLR3/IFN/CXCL10 responses. Given that TLR3
has been well studied in innate anti-microbial responses
against intracellular pathogens, it is possible that microbes
within the tumor microenvironment may directly influence
TLR3 responses. Further studies will be required to
completely delineate the role of the microbiome in
chemotherapy induced ICD in both pre-clinical and
clinical settings.

Patient immune status
One of the hallmarks of cancer progression is
the induction of immunosuppression, which allows
the tumor to evade detection and/or elimination by the
immune system [123, 156]. Tumors suppress the adaptive
immune response at the level of antigen presentation
by downregulating expression of tumor antigens,
antigen processing machinery, and MHC class I and II
molecules [157, 158]. In addition, tumor cells can drive
the expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous population of

the immune system which is characterized by IL-7 and
IL-15 driven homeostatic proliferation of lymphocytes
[180]. This homeostatic proliferation provides a critical
window of opportunity to skew the immune response
towards a specific antigen through vaccination or adoptive
transfer of antigen-specific lymphocytes [181, 184]. In a
pre-clinical lung cancer model, chemotherapy-induced
lymphopenia prior to vaccine administration was shown
to promote expansion of effector T cells relative to Tregs
[184]. Therefore, these specific situations would provide
rational justification for using high doses of chemotherapy
to strategically deplete bulk lymphocytes and create a
space for reshaping the tumor specific immune response.
However, when considering the potential benefits of
chemotherapy induced ICD, it is essential that the
patient’s immune system is able to respond to the dying
cell. Recently, the focus has now switched to metronomic
low dose chemotherapy, which has been shown to
selectively target Tregs and MDSCs without causing gross
lymphodepletion [185, 186].

antigens (TSAs) (neo-antigens). TAAs are more abundant
than TSAs, but TSAs are generally better at inducing
immune responses since they are recognized as non-self.
When chemotherapy induces tumor cell death, these
antigens are released by dying cells and are taken up by
APCs and presented to T cells [188, 189]. Treatment with
5-fluorouracil selectively upregulates the expression of
TAAs such as cancer-testis antigen and carcinoembryonic
antigen, hence increasing the antigenicity associated with
therapy [190]. In transplantable mesothelioma tumor
models expressing ovalbumin as a model antigen, the
tumor classically elicits an immune response against
the dominant epitope SIINFEKL [191]. Treatment with
chemotherapeutics was shown to broaden the range of
tumor antigens recognized by cytotoxic CD8 T cells [191].
However, co-administration of IL-2 at the same time as
chemotherapy completely abolished this phenomenon of
“epitope spreading” and refocused the immune response
towards the dominant SIIFENKL epitope [191]. This
finding suggests that administering immunotherapy too
close to ICD-inducing chemotherapy may have negative
effects on range of antigens recognized. Consistent with a
role in antigen diversification, dacarbazine administration
1 day prior to peptide vaccination in melanoma patients
significantly increased the antigenic repertoire of T
cells and induced greater tumor reactivity, compared
to vaccine therapy alone [192, 193]. In a pilot clinical
study examining the safety and feasibility administering
cyclophosphamide 7 days prior combined treatment

with GM-CSF, pegylated IFN, and DCs loaded with
autologous tumor lysate, cyclophosphamide pre-treatment
increased levels of IL-12p70, NK cell cytotoxicity, and
T cell reactivity to tumor antigens [194]. This study
also found cyclophosphamide pre-treatment reduced
the frequency of Tregs to levels observed in healthy
individuals. Furthermore, pre-clinical studies examining
the effect of administering cyclophosphamide before
or after vaccine therapy, found that cyclophosphamide
administered 1 day before vaccine therapy enhanced antitumor immunity [195, 196]. In contrast, administration of
cyclophosphamide after vaccine therapy had inhibitory
effects on the antigen-specific responses. Therefore,
appropriate sequence and timing of treatment play an
important role in influencing antigenicity and subsequently
determining the outcome of chemo-immunotherapy.

programmed cell death and the signals emanating from
dying cells. Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2015, 16:329-44.

Chemotherapy has long been perceived as the
practice of using chemicals to either limit the proliferation
or cause immunogenically silent death of cancer cells.
Based on this presumption, most pre-clinical work was
done in immunodeficient mice and without consideration
for the role of the immune system in drug efficacy. Recent
advances have challenged this old way of thinking, as the
immune system has been shown to play key roles in tumor
control mediated by chemotherapeutics. In particular, this
concept of “dying the right way” has shifted the focus
back to the immune system. Therefore, immunologic
parameters are slowly gaining recognition as important
therapeutic biomarkers for patients enrolled in clinical
trials [7, 188, 197]. It is important to note that while ICD
is an important component of chemotherapy-associated
anti-cancer immune responses, ICD is not the only way
chemotherapeutics facilitate an immune response against
cancer [4, 7]. Understanding the concepts and mechanisms
that underlie chemotherapy-induced ICD may help shed
light on new strategies for combining chemotherapy with
novel immunotherapy approaches.
