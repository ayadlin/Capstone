Abstract

Introduction

We observed that photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces the
expression and phosphorylation of the inhibitor of apoptosis
(IAP) protein survivin in murine and human cancer cells and
tumors. Survivin inhibits caspase-9, blocks apoptosis, and
is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation.
Survivin is a client protein for the 90-kDa heat shock protein
(Hsp-90), and the binding of survivin to Hsp-90 assists in the
maturation, proper folding, assembly, and transport of this
IAP protein. A derivative of the antibiotic geldanamycin, 17allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), interferes
with proper binding of client proteins, such as survivin, to
Hsp-90 and leads to misfolding of client proteins, ubiquination, and proteasome degradation. We hypothesized that
PDT efficacy may be reduced by treatment-mediated expression and phosphorylation of survivin, and therefore, targeting the survivin pathway could increase PDT responsiveness.
To address this hypothesis, we examined cellular and
molecular responses following exposure to PDT, 17-AAG,
and the combination of PDT plus 17-AAG in human BT-474
breast cancer cells using Photofrin and NPe6 as photosensitizers. Cells treated with the combination of PDT and
17-AAG exhibited decreased expression of the Hsp-90 client
proteins phosphorylated survivin, phosphorylated Akt, and
Bcl-2. The decreased expression of these client proteins was
accompanied by higher apoptotic indexes and increased
cytotoxicity. To confirm a specific role for survivin in
modulating PDT, we used a human melanoma cell line,
YUSAC2/T34A-C4, stably transfected with an inducible
dominant-negative survivin gene under the control of a
tetracycline-regulated (tet-off) promoter. PDT treatment of
melanoma cells expressing the dominant-negative survivin
resulted in increased cleavage of the caspase substrate
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity
when compared with results following PDT of the same
melanoma cell line expressing wild-type survivin. These
results show for the first time that targeting survivin and
possibly other Hsp-90 client proteins improves in vitro PDT
responsiveness and suggest that manipulation of the antiapoptotic pathway maintained by survivin may enhance PDTmediated cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4989–95]

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat a variety of solid
tumors, including malignancies of the lung, esophagus, brain,
prostate, head and neck, and skin (1–3). The Food and Drug
Administration–approved photosensitizer Photofrin as well as
several second-generation photosensitizers are used in a variety
of clinical trials. PDT induces the photochemical generation of
cytotoxic reactive oxygen species within the irradiated tissue,
which leads to tumor cell death through necrosis, apoptosis, and/
or autophagy (4–7). Vascular injury, tissue hypoxia, and inflammatory reactions with concomitant expression of growth factors,
matrix metalloproteinases, cytokines, and prostaglandins are
observed within the treated tumor microenvironment (8–12).
These treatment-related reactions can be associated with an
angiogenic and/or survival phenotype that may play a role in tumor
recurrences following PDT and highlight the need to more fully
understand the molecular responses initiated by PDT.
We recently observed that PDT induces increased expression and
phosphorylation of survivin in murine cancer cells and tumors.
Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family and
has been shown to suppress apoptosis and regulate cell division
(13–15). Phosphorylation of survivin extends the lifetime of this
IAP protein and allows for enhanced protein activity (16–18).
Survivin is detected in malignant lesions and in fetal tissue but is
absent in most adult differentiated tissues (17). A variety of
pharmacologic and environmental stimuli can increase survivin
expression, including UVB exposure, chemotherapeutic agents,
hypoxia, and vascular injury (17). Levels of survivin in clinical
tumor samples correlate inversely with patient prognosis, and upregulation of survivin is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (15, 19). The cytoprotective role of survivin
also extends beyond the tumor cell population to involve
endothelial cells within the tumor microenvironment (17, 20).
Survivin binds to the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp-90) in cells
and is therefore considered a Hsp-90 client protein (21). Hsp-90
provides the necessary intracellular chaperone environment for
proper folding and maturation of a variety of client proteins, many
of which are involved in signal transduction and cell proliferation
(17). Geldanamycin and its clinically related derivative, 17allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), bind to the
ATPase binding region of Hsp-90 and inhibit client protein binding
(22). Disrupting the chaperone function of Hsp-90 results in
destabilization and degradation of its client proteins and, in the
case of survivin, can initiate apoptosis and suppress cell
proliferation (21, 23, 24).
The goal of the current study was to determine if disruption
of the cellular function of survivin would modify the apoptotic
and cytotoxic responses of PDT. We first examined whether

photosensitizers with differing subcellular localization properties
induced PDT-mediated expression of survivin and its phosphorylated form in treated cells. We next used pharmacologic and
genetic approaches to determine if attenuating survivin levels
and activity would modify the effectiveness of PDT in human
cancer cells. Our results indicate that both porphyrin-based
(Photofrin) and chlorin-based (NPe6) photosensitizers induced
increased expression and phosphorylation of survivin. Our results
also show that inhibition of survivin increased PDT-mediated
apoptosis and cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that a
combined modality approach involving PDT and survivin
inhibition may enhance PDT effectiveness.

Materials and Methods
Drugs. Photofrin porfimer sodium (a gift from Axcan Scandipharma,
Inc.) was dissolved in 5% dextrose in water to make a 2.5 mg/mL stock
solution and then stored at 20jC. Mono-L-aspartyl chorin e6 or NPe6
(a gift from Porphyrin Products, Inc.) was dissolved in saline to make a
2.5 mg/mL stock solution and then stored at 20jC. Stock solutions of
photosensitizers were diluted in culture medium before use. 17-AAG
(purchased from A.G. Scientific, Inc.) was dissolved in DMSO at a
concentration of 1 mmol/L and stored at 20jC. The stock solution of
17-AAG was diluted in culture medium immediately before use.
Cell culture and tumor models. Mouse breast cancer (BA) and human
breast cancer (BT-474) cells were grown as monolayer cultures in RPMI 1640
or DMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. BA
tumors were generated by s.c. trochar injection of 1 mm3 pieces of tumor to
the hind right flank of 8- to 12-week-old female C3H/HeJ mice (25). The
human melanoma cell line (YUSAC2/T34A-C4) stably transfected with an
inducible phosphorylation-defective, dominant-negative survivin (Thr34 >
Ala) mutant controlled by the tetracycline (tet) promoter was kindly
provided by D. Grossman (Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT)
and maintained in DMEM containing 5% FCS, 0.5 Ag/mL tetracycline
(Sigma), 1.5 mg/mL G418 (Omega Scientific, Inc.), 2 mmol/L sodium
hydroxide, glutamine, and antibiotics (18).
In vitro and in vivo treatment protocols. For in vitro treatments, cells
were seeded in Petri dishes and incubated either for 24 h in complete growth
medium (BA and BT-474 cells) or for 48 h in complete selection medium
containing G418 in the presence or absence of tet (YUSAC2/T34A-C4 cells) to
allow for attachment. Photosensitization experiments were done as reported
previously (10, 12). Briefly, cells were incubated in the dark in medium
containing 5% serum together with either Photofrin or NPe6
(25 Ag/mL) for 16 h at 37jC. This medium was then removed and the cells
were then incubated for 30 min in fresh growth medium containing 10%
serum (BT cells) or 5% serum (YUSA cells) and then rinsed in medium
without serum before light treatment. Photofrin-incubated cells were
exposed to broad-spectrum red light (570–650 nm) generated by a parallel
series of red Mylar-filtered 30 W fluorescent bulbs using a dose rate of
0.35 mW/cm2. NPe6-incubated cells were exposed to 664 nm light generated
by a diode laser (Miravant Medical Technologies) using a dose rate of
2 mW/cm2. Treated cells were refed with complete growth medium in the
presence or absence of either 17-AAG (BT-474 cells) or tet (YUSAC2/T34A-C4
cells). Survival of BT-474 and YUSAC2/T34A-C4 cells was measured 24 h after
photosensitization using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Control and treated cells were transferred into
flat-bottomed 96-multiwell plates (5  104 per well), and MTT reagent was
added to a final concentration of 5 Ag/mL (26). The cells were incubated at
37jC for 4 h and cleavage of MTT was determined by absorbance at 570 nm
using a microplate reader. Survival of treated cells was normalized to control
cells. Eight samples were analyzed for each dose per experiment, and all
experiments were done in duplicate. In vivo PDT treatment of BA tumors
involved an i.v. injection of Photofrin (5 mg/kg) followed 24 h later with
tumor irradiation using a 630 nm diode laser (Diomed). Light was delivered
via a quartz fiber microlens system. A light dose rate of 75 mW/cm2 and a
total light dose of 50 J/cm2 were used for in vivo PDT treatments.

Detection of apoptosis. Cellular apoptosis was evaluated using a Cell
Death Detection ELISA Plus kit (Boehringer Mannheim) as reported
previously. This assay quantifies mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes
from cell lysates using monoclonal antibodies targeting DNA and histones
in a quantitative photometric sandwich enzyme immunoassay (27). Cells
were analyzed 24 h after treatment. Two samples were analyzed for each
dose and time point per experiment, and all experiments were done in
duplicate. Apoptotic enrichment factors were calculated from absorbance
ratios of treated versus control cells. Results were normalized for protein
concentrations.
Western immunoblot analysis. Protein expression was documented by
Western immunoblot analysis (10, 12). Cells were collected 24 h after PDT
and sonicated in 1 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.)
containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. BA tumors were homogenized
with a polytron in 1 reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Protein samples were
size separated on discontinuous polyacrylamide gels (7.5–14%) and
transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes. Filters were blocked
with 5% nonfat milk and then incubated overnight with either mouse
monoclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; clone C2.10; Novus
Biologicals), mouse monoclonal anti-cleaved PARP (Asp214; Cell Signaling
Technology), rabbit polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated survivin
(Thr34; Novus Biologicals), rabbit polyclonal antibody to survivin (Chemicon International), rabbit polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated Akt
(Ser473; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-Hsp-90 (SPA-846;
Stressgen Bioreagents Corp.), or mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (clone C-2;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Filters were then incubated with either an antimouse or an anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (Sigma), and the resulting
complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence autoradiography (Amersham Life Science). Protein loading was evaluated by subsequently incubating the filters with a mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody
(clone C-4; ICN).
Survivin protein measurements. Quantitative levels of survivin were
obtained for control and treated BT-474 cells using the human Total
Survivin TiterZyme Enzyme Immunometric Assay (EIA) kit (Assay Designs).
Protein concentrations were determined from cell lysates, and survivin
content was calculated per mg of total protein.
Photofrin uptake. Photofrin concentrations were measured in YUSAC2/
T34A-C4 cells growing in the presence or absence of tet using absorption
spectroscopy. Photofrin was extracted from cells by sonication in 0.2 N
NaOH. Porphyrin concentrations were determined from calibration curves
using absorption ratios at 390/470 nm (28). Results were expressed as Ag
Photofrin per mg of total protein.
Statistics. Statistical significance of EIA, ELISA, and MTT results was
determined using a two-tailed Student’s t test. Results with P < 0.05 were
considered significant.

Results
PDT induces expression of survivin and phosphorylated
survivin in treated cancer cells and tumors. A variety of
anticancer agents and exogenous stress conditions, including
exposure to Adriamycin, Taxol, and UVB, can increase survivin
expression (14–18). We initially examined whether PDT influenced
the expression profiles of survivin and phosphorylated survivin in
mouse BA mammary carcinoma cells and tumors. Figure 1A shows
that exposure of BA cells to an IC50 dose of Photofrin-mediated
PDT induced an increase in both survivin and phosphorylated
survivin expression when analyzed 24 h after treatment. Similar
results were observed when BA tumors growing in C3H mice were
treated with Photofrin-mediated PDT and assayed for survivin
levels 24 h after treatment as shown in Fig. 1B.
17-AAG attenuates the expression of Hsp-90 client proteins,
including survivin, and increases apoptosis and cytotoxicity in
PDT-treated cells. Survivin is a Hsp-90 client protein and binding
of survivin to Hsp-90 allows for proper protein folding and

maturation (21, 23, 24). The geldanamycin derivative 17-AAG leads
to proteasome degradation of Hsp-90 client proteins by competing
for the binding of these proteins to Hsp-90. We examined
cellular responses following treatment protocols involving PDT
with or without 17-AAG using human BT-474 breast cancer cells.
Expression of apoptotic-related proteins, including some
Hsp-90 client proteins, is shown in Fig. 2A and B for BT-474 cells
treated with either Photofrin- or NPe6-mediated PDT. At the time
of collection, we observed increased expression of survivin and
phosphorylated survivin. PDT did not alter the levels of
phosphorylated Akt above control photosensitizer alone levels.
Combining PDT with 17-AAG increased the cleavage of PARP from
the native 116-kDa enzyme to an 89-kDa fragment, enhanced
degradation of the Bcl-2 protein, and decreased expression
of survivin, phosphorylated survivin, and phosphorylated Akt.
Quantitative levels of survivin in PDT-treated BT-474 cells were
analyzed using an ELISA assay, and Fig. 2C and D showed a 3-fold
increase when compared with control levels. Cellular incubation
with 17-AAG resulted in decreased survivin levels, which were
not statistically significant, but this trend agreed with the
results obtained by Western immunoblot analysis. Cellular
exposure to 17-AAG did not modulate the expression of Hsp-90
or actin.
Apoptosis and cytotoxicity were determined for control and
treated cells 24 h after Photofrin- or NPe6-mediated PDT as

shown in Fig. 3. Both PDT alone and treatment with 17-AAG
alone caused measurable levels of apoptosis (Fig. 3A and B) and
cytotoxicity (Fig. 3C and D). Combining PDT with 17-AAG
further increased apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Incubation of cells
with DMSO at concentrations used to dissolve 17-AAG did not
affect molecular or cellular responses to PDT treatments (data
not shown).
Inducible expression of phosphorylation-defective, dominant-negative survivin in YUSAC2/T34A-C4 cells increases
apoptosis and cytotoxicity following PDT. YUSAC2/T34A-C4
melanoma cells expressing an inducible (tet-off) survivin mutant
Thr34 > Ala were used to confirm the involvement of the survivin
pathway in modulating the apoptotic response to PDT (18). Cells
were grown either in the presence of tet, which allows expression of
biologically active Thr34-phosphorylated survivin, or in the absence
of tet, which induced the expression of the survivin mutant that
cannot be phosphorylated at Thr34 due to the conversion of
threonine to alanine. Figure 4A (top) shows the expression pattern
for survivin and phosphorylated survivin in this experimental
model. In the absence of tet, the YUSAC2/T34A-C4 cells express a
16.5-kDa mutant survivin, whereas minimal survivin expression
was observed in the presence of tet. In agreement with previous
reports, there was a significant reduction in the expression of
Thr34-phosphorylated survivin for cells cultured in the absence of
tet compared with cells cultured in the presence of tet. Growing the
YUSAC2/T34-C4 cells in the presence or absence of tet did not alter
the uptake of Photofrin as shown in Fig. 4A (bottom) Apoptosis
measurements were obtained 24 h after Photofrin-mediated PDT
for YUSAC2/T34A-C4 cells cultured either in the presence or in the
absence of tet. Figure 4B (top) shows that apoptotic indexes
followed a dose-dependent pattern, and levels were significantly
higher under ‘‘tet-off ’’ culture conditions when the dominantnegative survivin was expressed. These results agree with Western
blot analysis data shown in Fig. 4B (bottom) where a dosedependent cleavage of PARP was observed following PDT only in
the absence of tet, conditions that inhibit survivin phosphorylation.
PDT treatment in the presence of tet (leading to survivin phosphorylation) resulted in reduced apoptosis and cleavage of PARP.
Cytotoxicity measurements for PDT-treated YUSAC2/T34A-C4
cells agreed with observed apoptosis levels. Figure 4C shows that
there was an increase in cytotoxicity for cells cultured in the
absence of tet when the dominant-negative survivin mutant was
overexpressed.

Discussion

Figure 1. Western immunoblot analysis documenting that PDT increases the
expression of survivin and phosphorylated survivin in murine BA breast cancer
cells and tumors. A, BA cells were incubated with Photofrin (PH ; 25 Ag/mL)
for 16 h and then exposed to 157.5 J/m2 of broad-spectrum red light. Cell lysates
from control (C ), Photofrin alone, and Photofrin-PDT cultures were collected
24 h after light exposure and assayed for survivin, phosphorylated survivin
(Phospho-Survivin ), and actin levels. B, C3H mice with s.c. transplanted BA
tumors were injected with Photofrin (5 mg/kg), and then 24 h later, the tumors
were exposed to a 50 J/cm2 dose of 630 nm light. Tumor lysates were collected
24 h after light exposure and assayed for survivin, phosphorylated survivin,
and actin levels.

We show for the first time that PDT increases the expression
of survivin and phosphorylated survivin in malignant cells and
tumors. Overexpression of survivin is associated with the
inhibition of apoptotic pathways, playing a primary role in
antagonizing mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (14, 15). In
addition to modulating apoptosis, growing evidence indicates
that survivin also is involved in regulating cell division. A critical
requirement for survivin stabilization and function is phosphorylation on Thr34 by the mitotic kinase p34cdc2-cyclin B1 (16, 29).
Signaling molecules up-regulated by PDT, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, hypoxiainducible factor-1a, activator protein-1, and nuclear factor-nB,
are inducers of the expression of survivin (8, 9). Likewise, inflammatory cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular injury, and hypoxia are associated with increased expression

Figure 2. 17-AAG decreases survivin and phosphorylated survivin levels in PDT-treated human BT-474 breast cancer cells. Cells were incubated with Photofrin
(A; 25 Ag/mL) for 16 h and then exposed to broad-spectrum red light (315 or 630 J/m2) or with NPe6 (B; 25 Ag/mL) for 16 h and then exposed to 664 nm red light
(1,200 J/m2). Cell lysates from control, photosensitizer alone, 17-AAG alone (1 Amol/L), and PDT-treated cells in the absence ( ) or presence (+) of 17-AAG were
collected 24 h after light exposure and analyzed for protein expression of PARP, cleaved PARP, Bcl-2, phosphorylated Akt (Phospho-Akt ), survivin, phosphorylated
survivin, Hsp-90, and actin by Western immunoblot analysis. Survivin levels were also quantified following Photofrin-PDT (C ) or NPe6-PDT (D ) using a human

and/or stability of survivin and these responses are also increased
following PDT (10–12). Studies are currently under way to
identify exactly how PDT induces expression and activation of
survivin.
Survivin is undetectable in most terminally differentiated
normal tissues but is highly expressed in many malignancies
(30). Patients with tumors expressing high survivin levels generally
have a poor prognosis concomitant with increased rates of
recurrence, resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and a
reduced apoptotic index (19, 20, 30). Therapeutic procedures
targeting survivin could therefore reduce the survival phenotype
observed in tumor tissue without affecting normal tissue (17). In
this regard, a variety of strategies are being tested to target
survivin, including (a) generating antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells
against survivin peptides; (b) use of antisense molecules,
ribozymes, and dominant-negative mutants of survivin; (c) pharmacologic inhibition of survivin phosphorylation; and (d) pharmacologic inhibition of survivin binding to Hsp-90 (21, 23, 30).
Our discovery that survivin expression and phosphorylation are

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

increased following PDT led to the hypothesis that survivin
modulates PDT responsiveness.
To address this issue, we used both a pharmacologic and a
genetic approach to examine the effects of modulating survivin
expression and phosphorylation on PDT responsiveness. We also
examined photosensitizers with differing subcellular localization
properties and observed that PDT using either Photofrin or NPe6
induced expression and phosphorylation of survivin (6). Survivin
is a Hsp-90 client protein and Hsp-90 promotes the proper
folding, maturation, and transport of client proteins within a cell
(21). A clinically relevant derivative of the benzoquinone
ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin, 17-AAG, binds to the ATP/
ADP pocket of Hsp-90, inhibits Hsp-90 function, and leads to the
disassociation and degradation of client proteins (31). We
observed that 17-AAG alone induced measurable cytotoxicity in
human BT-474 breast cancer cells, and this observation agrees
with previous reports for various human cancer cell lines
exposed to this geldanamycin derivative (31, 32). Exposure of
PDT-treated cells to 17-AAG decreased levels of survivin, Akt, and

Bcl-2. This procedure also led to increased PARP cleavage,
apoptosis, and cytotoxicity. Interestingly, this response was
observed using photosensitizers that primarily localize either to
the mitochondria (Photofrin) or to the lysosomes (NPe6). Our
observations agree with studies showing 17-AAG potentiating the
radiation response of tumor cells via an apoptotic mechanism as
well as reducing IC50 levels of chemotherapeutic agents in tumor
cells (31, 32).
Our experiments combining PDT with 17-AAG clearly show that
disrupting Hsp-90 client protein interaction can decrease survivin
levels and increase both apoptosis and cytotoxicity. 17-AAG is in
clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of tumors, and
therefore, combining PDT with 17-AAG may be clinically relevant
(30, 33). However, there are several Hsp-90 client proteins in
addition to survivin that could be involved in modulating PDT,
and therefore, this pharmacologic approach is a nonspecific
targeting protocol. To confirm a specific role for survivin in
modulating PDT, we used a genetic approach involving expression
of an inducible dominant-negative survivin to determine if
selective inhibition of this IAP protein could modulate PDT

responsiveness. Previous studies have shown that suppression of
survivin phosphorylation by the inducible expression of the
phosphorylation-defective, dominant-negative survivin gene
enhances tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth (18).
Our results show that selective targeting of the survivin pathway
can increase PDT-mediated apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Studies are
in progress to determine if PDT enhances survivin phosphorylation
in normal cells and tissue.
In summary, although PDT continues to be an effective
clinical option for treating solid tumors, it also induces
considerable stress within the tumor microenvironment. This
includes both oxidative stress produced by the photochemical
generation of reactive oxygen species and hypoxia resulting from
the rapid vascular damage produced by PDT and/or by the
photochemical consumption of oxygen (8). A consequence of
PDT-mediated stress is the induction of a survival phenotype
associated with increased expression of angiogenic growth
factors, cytokines, proteinases, and antiapoptotic molecules.
Our increasing knowledge of PDT responses at a molecular
level provides significant opportunities to further improve the

therapeutic effectiveness of PDT. Clinically relevant inhibitors
that block angiogenesis, prostanoid release, and proteinase
activation can enhance PDT responsiveness in the laboratory
because there is a differential effect on tumor tissue compared
with normal tissue (8, 12). The data obtained in the current
study suggest that strategies to decrease the survival phenotype
associated with PDT-mediated survivin expression may also
improve PDT effectiveness.
