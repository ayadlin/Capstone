ABSTRACT
Albuminuria is an indicator of cardiovascular risk and renal damage in hypertensive
individuals. Chronic renin–angiotensin system (RAS) suppression facilitates blood
pressure control and prevents development of new-onset-albuminuria. A significant
number of patients, however, develop albuminuria despite chronic RAS blockade,
and the physiopathological mechanisms are underexplored. Urinary exosomes reflect
pathological changes taking place in the kidney. The objective of this work was to
examine exosomal protein alterations in hypertensive patients with albuminuria in the
presence of chronic RAS suppression, to find novel clues underlying its development.
Patients were followed-up for three years and were classified as: a) patients with
persistent normoalbuminuria; b) patients developing de novo albuminuria; and c)
patients with maintained albuminuria. Exosomal protein alterations between groups
were identified by isobaric tag quantitation (iTRAQ). Confirmation was approached
by target analysis (SRM). In total, 487 proteins were identified with high confidence.
Specifically, 48 proteins showed an altered pattern in response to hypertension and/
or albuminuria. Out of them, 21 proteins interact together in three main functional
clusters: glycosaminoglycan degradation, coagulation and complement system,
and oxidative stress. The identified proteins constitute potential targets for drug
development and may help to define therapeutic strategies to evade albuminuria
progression in hypertensive patients chronically treated.

INTRODUCTION

predictive capacity is based on the fact that microvascular
damage is present in the kidney and this and other forms
of target organ damage have been shown to predict
mortality even when global cardiovascular risk (SCOREbased evaluated) is not elevated [4]. Chronic suppression
of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown
to facilitate blood pressure (BP) control and prevent the

development of new-onset albuminuria [5]. Nonetheless,
we and others have shown that hypertensive patients under
chronic RAS suppression may present albuminuria; in
particular, de novo albuminuria developed in up to 16.1%
of normoalbuminuric patients during a three–year period
of follow-up [6, 7]. The physiopathological mechanisms
mediating albuminuria progression in hypertensive
patients under chronic RAS suppression are, however,
underexplored.
Exosomes are biological messengers with proven
roles in regulating immune response, antigen presentation,
RNA and protein transfer, and cell–cell interaction/
signaling. Exosomes from the renal system may provide
with novel clues in the clinical setting of albuminuria
[8, 9, 10]. Indeed, urinary exosomes contain proteins
characteristic of every renal tubule epithelial cell type
and from the urinary collecting system, including proteins
that are characteristic of the membrane and cytoplasm
of the cells in which they have been generated. As such,
they should be regarded not only as waste disposal units,
but also as messengers, carrying molecular indicators
of renal dysfunction and structural injury [11]. This role
for exosomes gains particular importance in complex
scenarios where multi-organ crosstalk takes place
[8, 12]. We previously showed that urinary exosomes
reflect protein changes taking place in the kidney in
diabetic nephropathy [13], thus constituting an accessible
source of “information” compared to renal biopsy.
Additionally, exosomes constitute a sub-proteome of
the urine and its analysis allow approaching molecular
changes that otherwise are hidden if pursued in the whole
urine. Previous studies from our group showed molecular
fingerprints in urine and plasma linked to albuminuria
development in hypertensive patients who are under
chronic RAS suppression. In this study, we investigate a
potential role for urinary exosomes in the search for novel
markers in this clinical setting.

were used for iTRAQ analysis. Two biological replicates
were analyzed per group with each comprising 2–4
individual samples (see Supplementary Figure 1 for
experimental design). Proteomic data derived from this
study are deposited in Peptide-Atlas (accession number
PASS00970).
A total of 487 proteins with more than 3 peptides
were identified in urinary exosomes (Supplementary
Table 1). Among these, 100 proteins were identified for the
first time in urinary exosomes according to the ExoCarta
database (Supplementary Table 2). Exosomal markers
including Tsg101, CD63, annexins A3, A4, A5, A6, and
A7, flotillin-1, clathrin1, and LAMP1 were identified and
no significant differences were found between N, dnA and
MHA groups confirming un-biased exosomal isolation.
Some of the identified proteins have been previously
assigned specifically to Bowman’s capsule, proximal
tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, collecting duct or
bladder, and no differences in response to albuminuria or
hypertension were detected (Supplementary Table 3).

Exosomes have distinct protein signatures in
response to albuminuria
Proteins whose levels were identified to be altered
were those with a significance cut off value of Zq ≥ 1.4
(absolute value) versus the control group, and showing
intra-group consistency of variation between the two
biological replicates analyzed per group. With these
criteria, iTRAQ quantitative analysis revealed 48 proteins
(out of the 487 identified) showing altered levels in
hypertensive patients under chronic RAS suppression as
compared with healthy subjects (Table 1). The magnitude
of protein alteration in Table 1 is represented by a heat
map (red, up-regulation; green, down-regulation versus
the control group). Three main trends could be observed,
being up- or down-regulated in response to: hypertension
without albuminuria (9 proteins), maintained albuminuria
(18 proteins), and de novo albuminuria (21 proteins).
According to the Human Protein Atlas, 56% of the
identified proteins have annotated expression in the
kidney, mainly in the tubule (26 proteins) but also in the
glomerulus (13 proteins). The majority of these proteins
were also identified in a recent study characterizing the
proteome of urinary exosomes specifically released by
podocytes [15].
We evaluated a sub-set of representative proteins
significantly responding to de novo albuminuria,
myeloperoxidase (MPO), olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4)
and antithrombin-III (AT3), using a different analytical
technique (SRM-LC-MS/MS) in an independent cohort
of 40 non-diabetic hypertensive patients under chronic
suppression of RAS and in 14 healthy subjects. In this
target analysis, all subjects who were recruited for the
iTRAQ analysis (but two control individuals) were
included, and individual samples (not pools) were

RESULTS
Exosomal proteins identified in hypertensive
patients under chronic RAS suppression
Urinary exosomes and their potential role in
the physiopathological mechanisms responsible for
albuminuria development in hypertensive patients under
chronic RAS suppression were investigated. Quantitative
iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis was used to
explore exosomal protein alterations, allowing deep
coverage of the analyzed proteome as previously shown
in plasma in this clinical setting [14]. The present work
focused on proteins. While intact endogenous peptides are
also of great interest, and for which different analytical
strategies should be applied, they were beyond the scope
of the present study. Urine exosome samples from the

analyzed. A specific SRM assay was developed with high
sensitivity and high-throughput capacity in alignment with
our previously published study in urine [16]. Changes
in their levels were confirmed for three representative
proteins, OLFM4, AT3 and MPO, chosen in view that they
showed variation in dnA, which is an earlier response in the
pathological process, their variation rate, their abundance
(estimated in view of number of identified peptides) or their
relationship with other proteins previously identified in
plasma/urine in this clinical context (e.g. ceruloplasmin or
MMP9). OLFM4 and AT3 levels were increased and MPO
was decreased in the dnA group. Receiver operating curves
showed good sensitivity and specificity in differentiating
the dnA group from the control group, with t-test values
of 0.029 (MPO), 0.0089 (AT3) and 0.0097 (OLFM4) and

response, defense and wounding (Figure 2). In particular,
the altered proteins are major players in immune
response, complement activation, proteolysis and
metabolic processes, mainly related to metabolism of
sulphur compounds, lipids and polysaccharides. Proteinprotein interaction networks revealed that 21 out of those
48 proteins interacted together, and are implicated in three
main functional clusters: “glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
degradation”, “coagulation and complement system”, and
“oxidative stress” (graphically summarized in Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
Hypertension is associated with end-organ damage,
particularly affecting heart, vessels and kidney, leading
to significant worsening of cardiovascular and renal
prognosis. Albuminuria is an indicator of cardiovascular
risk and of end-stage renal disease. We recently reported
significant alterations in proteins from urine and plasma
in response to albuminuria and its de novo development
in these hypertensive patients [14, 16, 17], demonstrating
that subjacent biological mechanisms have a measurable
molecular phenotype in biological fluids which, in some
cases, may allow for anticipating the response of the
traditional clinical marker (albuminuria). Exosomes have

been shown to reflect molecular changes taking place in
kidney tissue from patients with diabetic nephropathy
[13]. In the present study we searched for the strongest
variations in urinary exosomes linked to albuminuria, in
search of a better understanding of the interconnected
dynamic processes taking place in the non-diabetic
hypertensive kidney under chronic RAS suppression.

such as antithrombin III (AT3, SerpinC1) and protein
C inhibitor (PCI, PAI-3, SerpinA5) [20], both of which
we found increased in urinary exosomes of hypertensive
patients. AT3 is related to homeostasis in the kidney,
and its concentration in urine correlates with albumin
and plasminogen (PLG) excretion [21]. The main
source of PCI is liver; however, its synthesis has also
been reported in kidney where it is produced mainly by
proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) [22]. PCI is a
pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory protein that inhibits
urinary plasminogen activator (uPA), a serine protease that
activates plasminogen by converting it to plasmin, which
acts to lyse fibrin clots. PLG is synthesized in liver but
often extravasates during inflammation. We also found
increased PLG in urinary exosomes from the MHA group.
PLG can bind to annexin A2 (ANXA2), promoting its
activation to form plasmin [23].We found decreased levels
of exosomal ANXA2 and ANXA1 in the MHA group.
Annexins are a family of calcium-dependent phospholipidbinding proteins with anti-inflammatory activity [24].
Down-regulation of both ANXA1 and ANXA2 exosomal
proteins is in agreement with a pro-inflammatory scenario
in this clinical context.
Two exosomal proteins whose levels were altered
in the normoalbuminuric (N) group as compared with
controls are also involved in coagulation and inflammatory

Glomerular basement membrane disruption,
proteases inhibition and inflammatory response
Enzymes linked to the GAG pathway, specifically
beta-galactosidase (GLB1), beta-glucuronidase (GUSB),
N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS) and N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), were increased in
the MHA group, and GLB1 was also increased in the dnA
group (Figure 4). These four enzymes are responsible for
the GAG degradation and may be related to glomerular
basement membrane (GBM) disruption, which could
lead to defective filtering [18]. One of the degradation
products that would be enhanced in pathologic conditions
is the proteoglycan heparan sulphate. Previous findings
suggest that heparan sulphate facilitates the passage
of proteins through the GBM [19]. This proteoglycan
binds to and modulates the effects of several proteins,
including heparin-dependent serine protease inhibitors

Complement system and inflammatory response

response: epithelial growth factor (EGF), which was
increased, and a-2 macroblobulin (A2M), which was
decreased. EGF in the kidney is a modulator of glomerular
dynamics, renal metabolism and tubular transport, and
plays a role in maintaining and repairing the epithelium
[25]. A2M is a major inhibitor of proteases in body
fluids and is the most important inhibitor of circulating
metalloproteinases (MMPs) [26]. The response of the two
proteins, displaying alterations at an early stage when
albuminuria is not present, point to subjacent de-regulation
of renal metabolism. The decrease in the level of A2M
in the N group, together with the up-regulation observed
for the GAG degradation pathway in albuminuria are in
agreement with a deleterious remodeling of the GBM
involving pathological MMP-9 activity, which might
contribute to glomerular hyperfiltration, albuminuria
escape and loss of renal function, as previously published
by us [27].
The level of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT, SerpinA1),
a heparin-independent serine protease inhibitor, was
significantly increased in exosomes from albuminuric
patients, which is consistent with our previous finding that
AAT levels are increased in whole urine from hypertensive
patients who develop albuminuria [16]. AAT has also been
suggested to regulate inflammation and the accumulation of
mesangial matrix, protecting the urinary tract against attack
by proteases, and could be a marker of podocyte stress [28].

A sub-set of the identified proteins is linked to the
complement system, as part of the immune response [29].
The complement system has three activation pathways:
the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways. The level
of mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine
protease-2 (MASP-2) was decreased in exosomes from
the dnA group, while components C3, C4a and C4b
were increased in albuminuria condition, pointing to a
disfavored lectin pathway. Levels of complement C3
and C4 are also increased in chronic inflammation [30].
Moreover, excess protein traffic occurs in proteinuric
nephropathies, causing an inflammatory response with
local increases in C3 [31], and high baseline levels of C3
correlate with higher risk of developing hypertension,
diabetes mellitus or myocardial infarction [30]. Our data
are in accord with these previous observations.

Oxidative stress
We detected an increase in the levels of transferrin
(TF) in exosomal fractions of hypertensive patients
with albuminuria. Transferrin is an iron-binding serum
protein that upregultaes C3 synthesis in PTECs [32].
The iron moiety of transferrin is toxic to PTECs as a
result of intracellular iron accumulation and peroxidative

injury after reabsorption. Conversely, iron depletion was
shown to have a positive effect in inhibiting oxidative
stress in experimental diabetes [33]. Our data indicate
an accumulation of transferrin in kidney in albuminuria,
with a potential deleterious effect via excess iron
accumulation. Ceruloplasmin (CP) levels were also found
increased in patients with hypertension and albuminuria.
CP is a copper-containing glycoprotein antioxidant that
may function as a pro-oxidant in conditions of increased
oxidative stress by inducing ROS production and lowdensity lipoprotein oxidation [34]. We detected a positive
correlation between CP levels in urinary exosomes and
increased albuminuria, as we previously described for
plasma CP from hypertensive patients under chronic RAS
suppression who progress to albuminuria [17].
CP also acts by binding to and inhibiting the activity
of myeloperoxidase (MPO) [35], the exosomal levels of
which were decreased in the dnA group. Following the
same trend than observed for MPO in the N and dnA
groups were two intracellular calcium-binding proteins,
S100A8 and S100A9, which form the heterodimer

calprotectin. MPO and calprotectin have been shown to
work synergistically to stimulate ROS formation [36].
Additionally, calprotectin also inhibits MMPs, whose
activities were previously found to be increased in this
clinical setting [27]. While an increase in the level of blood
S100 proteins in response to inflammation has been widely
documented and positively correlate with cardiovascular
risk, diabetes and proteinuria [37, 38], the opposite
was found here for exosomal fractions in hypertensive
patients with incipient or no albuminuria, which showed
decreased levels of S100A8 and S100A9. This may be
explained on the basis of tissue repair mechanisms. In
kidney disease, controversy exists over the beneficial/
deleterious effect of M1/M2 macrophage polarization. In
one study, a shift in macrophage polarization from M1 to
M2 was related to a decrease in albuminuria [39], while
in another study, repolarization to M1 by drug treatment
inhibited kidney damage progression [40]. In an ischemiareperfusion-induced injury model, mice genetically
deficient for calprotectin presented an increase in
M2-polarized macrophages during the repair phase,

leading to ineffective tissue repair, increased renal damage
and sustained inflammation [41]. This tissue repair effect
may require physical contact between the M2 macrophage
and the injured tubular epithelial cell [42], which we
hypothesize could be mediated by exosomes. Our data
are in agreement with an inefficient tissue repair at early
stages in albuminuria development and maintenance.
This is an initial study that focuses on a largely
unexplored clinical field. We have identified protein
changes in urinary exosomes from hypertensives
developing albuminuria, despite of chronic RAS
suppression with different variation trends. In particular,
some proteins show a dynamic change in the sense that
they respond to dnA and apparently return to normalized
levels in MHA. This finding, also observed in specific
metabolites as shown in previous studies, is not surprising
and we can hypothesized that the mechanisms operating
when the conditions for a progression of albuminuria are
present are reset once albuminuria is more established.
The main limitation of the present study is the low number
of patients and thus the clinical usefulness of the exosomal
proteins identified and the proposed physiological
changes taking place linked to albuminuria development
in hypertensive patients under chronic suppression of
RAS should be validated in larger multicenter cohorts.
Although unavoidable, a potential bias regarding patients’

medication compared to control individuals could be a
limitation of the study. However, particular attention was
paid to protein changes with albuminuria development and
no significant differences were observed between patients’
groups. All them were under RAS suppression and other
drugs, if necessary. As a strength, we would highlight
that this is the first study to explore exosomes as a novel
source of diagnostic/prognostic markers for albuminuria
development in this context. The present findings
complement and extend our previous work in urine,
plasma and circulating extracellular vesicles. We believe
that exosomes contain clues to understand the diverse
progression of hypertension under chronic treatment, and
our data indicates that this issue should be investigated
more in depth.

A schematic workflow is shown in Figure 5. Patient
selection was based on a previous study showing the
development of de novo albuminuria in hypertensive
patients during chronic RAS suppression [7]. In that
study, the evolution of patients from the Hypertension
Unit-Hospital 12 de Octubre who had been under chronic

RAS suppression for at least five years was reviewed.
Baseline data were obtained after a 3-month stabilization
period. From baseline, patients were subsequently
followed for a minimum period of three years, during
which time progression to albuminuria was evaluated.
RAS suppression was maintained during the entire
length of follow-up. Of the normoalbuminuric patients
at baseline, 16.1% developed de novo albuminuria
(i.e., absent at baseline and developed later) during the
3-year period. De novo albuminuria development was
defined as either new-onset high albuminuria (albuminto-creatinine ratio 20–200 mg/g of creatinine in men and
30–300 mg/g of creatinine in women) confirmed in at least
a second occasion among the 6-monthly determinations
performed in three samples of early-morning urine, or
very high albuminuria (> 200 mg/g creatinine in men
and > 300 mg/g creatinine in women). We performed
exosomal analysis at the end of the third year of followup. A group of 40 non-diabetic hypertensive patients were
selected as a representative cohort and classified into the
following three sub-groups: a) patients who remained
normoalbuminuric during the follow-up (defined as N);
b) patients developing de novo albuminuria during the
follow-up (defined as dnA); and c) patients with persistent
albuminuria since baseline and during the follow-up
(defined as MHA, maintained high albuminuria). Table 2

lists the baseline characteristics and medication of patients.
The presence of secondary forms of arterial hypertension
and diabetes mellitus were excluded. A control group of
16 healthy normotensive subjects (defined as C) was also
included (Table 3). The study fulfilled the requirements
of an “Omics” study in terms of group size and technical
workflow [43]. The clinical study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Hospital 12 de Octubre and was
conducted according to the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki. All patients signed written informed consent
before inclusion.

Urine collection and exosome isolation
Urine collection and exosome isolation based on

Briefly, morning urine was collected in a sterile container
and stored at −80ºC until analysis. For exosome isolation,
urine was defrosted at 37ºC and vigorously vortexed
centrifuged at low-speed (17000 g, 10 min, 4ºC), the
supernatant was collected and the pellet was treated with
200 mg/mL dithiothreitol (DTT) in isolation solution
(10 mM triethanolamine, 250mM sucrose, pH 7.6), heated
at 37ºC for 10 min to reduce Tamm-Horsfall polymeric
protein, releasing entrapped exosomes and increasing
exosomal recovery [13, 44, 45]. After a new low-speed

centrifugation (17000 g, 10 min) the resulting pellet was
discarded and the supernatant was pooled together with
the supernatant from the first centrifugation step. This was
then centrifuged at 175000 g for 70 min at 4ºC to pellet
the exosomes. Isolated exosomes were characterized by
electronic microscopy. The typical shape of exosomes
(double membrane, cup-shaped vesicles) and appropriate
size in the range of 50–100 nm was observed [45].

(Supplementary Figure 1). One hundred micrograms of
total protein from each biological replicate was loaded
onto an SDS-PAGE gel to concentrate all the proteins in
a single band. Gel bands were reduced with 10 mM DTT,
alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide, and digested overnight
at 37ºC with 80 ng/mL of modified trypsin (Promega,

(TFA). TFA was added to a final concentration of 1%
and the peptides were desalted onto C18 Oasis-HLB
cartridges and dried-down for further analysis. For stable
isobaric labeling, the tryptic peptides were dissolved in
triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer, and the
peptide concentration was determined by measuring amide
bonds with the Direct Detect system (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA). Equal amounts of each peptide sample were
labeled using the 8-plex iTRAQ Reagents Multiplex Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to
manufacturer›s protocol. Samples were then concentrated
in a Speed Vac, desalted onto C18 Oasis-HLB cartridges
and dried-down for further analysis. To increase proteome
coverage, iTRAQ-labeled samples were fractionated by
mixed-cation exchange chromatography (Oasis HLBMCX columns) into six fractions, and analyzed by
LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using
a C-18 reversed phase nano-column (75 µm internal
diameter × 50 cm, 2 µm particle size, Acclaim PepMap
RSLC, 100 C18; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a
continuous acetonitrile gradient consisting of 0–30% B
in 360 min, 50–90% B in 3 min (A = 0.1% formic acid;
B = 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A flow rate of
200 nL/min was used to elute peptides from the nanocolumn to an emitter nanospray needle for real time
ionization and peptide fragmentation. An enhanced
FT-resolution spectrum (resolution = 70,000) followed by
the MS/MS spectra from the 15 most intense parent ions
were analyzed along the chromatographic run. Dynamic
exclusion was set at 40 s. For peptide identification, all
spectra were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer (1.4.0.29,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) using SEQUEST-HT (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). For database searching at the Uniprot
database, containing all sequences from human and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cRAP contaminants (March 06, 2013; 70024 entries), the
parameters selected were as follows: trypsin digestion with
2 maximum missed cleavage sites, precursor and fragment
mass tolerances of 2 Da and 0.02 Da, respectively,
carbamidomethyl cysteine, iTRAQ modifications at
N-terminal and Lys residues as fixed modifications, and
methionine oxidation as dynamic modification. Peptide
identification was validated using the probability ratio
method [46]; false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated
using inverted databases and the refined method [47],
with an additional filtering for precursor mass tolerance
of 15 ppm [48]. Protein quantification from reporter ion
intensities and statistical analysis of quantitative data to
identify significant proteins were performed using QuiXoT
based on a statistical model [49]. We applied stringent
criteria, considering differentially expressed those proteins
identified with more than three peptides, and log2-ratios
expressed in the form of the standardized variables (Zq) ≥
1.4 (absolute value) with p-values ≤ 0.05, with Zq denoting
the mean of the two replicates versus the control group.

Systems biology analysis
Identified proteins were compared to the entries in
the ExoCarta database, a repository comprising proteins
previously identified in exosomes [50]. Expression and
localization of proteins in renal tubule and glomeruli
were assigned by means of Human Protein Atlas [51]
and scientific literature. PANTHER (Protein ANalysis
THrough Evolutionary Relationships) database [52]
and DAVID (6.7) [53] were used for protein functional
classification. Protein pathway analysis was carried out
using STRING 9.0 software (highest confidence, MCL
clustering tool) [54], a database of known and predicted
protein interactions.

LGC, PJM and MML carried out exosome isolation,
target analysis, and participated in data analysis and
interpretation. MBM participated in data analysis. GRH
and FC participated in the study design and manuscript
draft. JS and EC participated in patients’ recruitment.
JAL and JV participated in iTRAQ analysis. FV, MGB,
LMR and GAL participated in the conceived of the
study, in its design and coordination and helped to draft
the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.

Urine samples from the 40 non-diabetic hypertensive
patients under chronic RAS suppression and 14 healthy
subjects (including those analyzed by iTRAQ) were
used for SRM-LC-MS/MS analysis. All individuals
have been included in the iTRAQ analysis, but samples
were analyzed by SRM individually, not including
pools. Theoretical SRM transitions were designed using
Skyline (1.1.0.2905) [55] and manually inspected.
Protein specificity was confirmed by protein BLAST
and proteotypic peptides were selected for SRM analysis
(Supplementary Table 4). Protein extracts were obtained
from exosomes isolated from individual urine samples. In
total, 30 μg of protein per individual sample was digested
and peptide mixtures were analyzed by SRM-LC-MS/MS
as described [16, 45, 56] using a 6460 Triple Quadrupole
LC/MS/MS (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA,
USA). Briefly, peptide separation was performed on a
ProtID Zorbax 300B-C18-5 μm chip with a 43 × 0.075-mm
analytical column and a 40 nL enrichment column (Agilent
Technologies). Two microliters of sample was injected at
3 μL/min and separation took place at 0.4 μL/min in a
continuous acetonitrile gradient: 70% B at 10 min, 95%
B at 12 min until 14.2 min and 0% B for 2 min (B = 0.1%
formic acid in acetonitrile). The system was controlled by
Mass Hunter LC–MS Acquisition Software (v4.01). The
mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with
capillary voltage of 1970 V, 325°C source gas temperature,
and 5 L/min source gas flow. The fragmentor was set to
130 V, dwell time to 20 ms, delta EMV to 600 V, and
collision energy was optimized for each SRM transition.
For calculation of statistically significant differences
in protein levels between groups, the ROUT method
was applied to detect outliers based on the FDR, setting
Q value to 5%. The Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s
multiple comparisons post-test and 95% confidence level
was then performed. Analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 6 (6.01) software (GraphPad Prism Inc.,
La Jolla, CA, USA) and Metaboanalyst web server (3.0).
