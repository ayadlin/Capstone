ABSTRACT
Melanomas are characterized by activating “driver” mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KIT,
GNAQ, and GNA11. Resultant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling
makes some melanomas susceptible to BRAF (BRAF V600 mutations), MEK1/2 (BRAF
V600, L597, fusions; NRAS mutations), or other kinase inhibitors (KIT), respectively.
Among driver-negative (“pan-negative”) patients, an unexplained heterogeneity of
response to MEK1/2 inhibitors has been observed. Analysis of 16 pan-negative melanoma
cell lines revealed that 8 (50%; termed Class I) are sensitive to the MEK1/2 inhibitor,
trametinib, similar to BRAF V600E melanomas. A second set (termed Class II) display
reduced trametinib sensitivity, paradoxical activation of MEK1/2 and basal activation
of ERBBs 1, 2, and 3 (4 lines, 25%). In 3 of these lines, PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway
signaling is abrogated using the ERBB inhibitor, afatinib, and proliferation is even further
reduced upon the addition of trametinib. A potential mechanism of ERBB activation in
Class II melanomas is minimal expression of the ERK1/2 phosphatase, DUSP4, as ectopic
restoration of DUSP4 attenuated ERBB signaling through potential modulation of the ERBB
ligand, amphiregulin (AREG). Consistent with these data, immunohistochemical analysis
of patient melanomas revealed a trend towards lower overall DUSP4 expression in pannegative versus BRAF- and NRAS-mutant tumors. This study is the first to demonstrate
that differential ERBB activity in pan-negative melanoma may modulate sensitivity to
clinically-available MEK1/2 inhibitors and provides rationale for the use of ERBB inhibitors,
potentially in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors, in subsets of this disease.

RESULTS

GNAQ (Q209) and GNA11 (Q209) [1–5]. Importantly,
all of these mutations have been shown to activate the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway. Notably, BRAF V600E and KIT kinase
domain mutations are associated with high sensitivity
to targeted BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) or
KIT (imatinib, nilotinib) small molecule inhibitors,
respectively [6–12]. In addition to BRAF-specific
inhibition with vemurafenib and dabrafenib, the
MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib is also approved for the
treatment of metastatic or unresectable BRAF V600mutant melanoma [13–16]. The optimum treatment for
other subsets, including NRAS-, GNAQ- or GNA11mutant melanomas, remains to be determined.
Despite the exciting advances in targeted treatment
for melanoma, up to one-third of tumors express none
of these driver mutations, herein called “pan-negative”.
Because they have no identifiable drug target, treatment
options for these patients are extremely limited.
Chemotherapy may be utilized but has limited efficacy and
no clear survival benefit. “Targeted” immunotherapies such
as ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4/
anti-CTLA-4) and anti-programmed death-1/programmed
death 1-ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) monoclonal
antibodies, are emerging as effective treatment for both
driver-positive and -negative melanomas, but efficacy is
not uniform and many patients fail to respond [17–20].
More recently, in melanomas previously considered pannegative for common driver mutations, we identified
non-V600 BRAF mutations at codons L597 and K601
[21] and BRAF fusions [22]. Importantly, both alterations
activate the MAPK pathway and the induced signaling
confers sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition. As a result of
these studies, MEK1/2 inhibitors are being evaluated for
use in the BRAF non-V600-mutant and BRAF fusion
subsets through an ongoing, multicenter Phase II clinical
trial (NCT02296112). Taken together, these data suggest
that constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway is a
critical factor in the pathogenesis of most melanomas.
Current evidence suggests that many pan-negative
melanoma cell lines are sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibitors
without a known molecular basis [23, 24]. Based on these
observations, and because the majority of currently known
driver mutations in melanoma result in MAPK pathway
activation, an open question is whether all pan-negative
melanomas could be treated with MEK1/2 inhibitors.
Here, we investigated sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition
in 16 pan-negative melanoma cell lines and found that
differences in ERBB activation and DUSP4 expression
may modulate responses. In the future, these studies may
lead to novel clinical trials involving pharmacological
inhibition of ERBB family members in combination with
established MEK1/2 inhibitors in otherwise untreatable,
pan-negative melanoma.

Pan-negative melanomas display differential
sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition
At Vanderbilt, patient melanomas are routinely
screened for well-established and targetable driver point
mutations in BRAF (codon V600), NRAS (G12, G13,
and Q61), KIT (W557, V559, L576, K642, and D816),
GNAQ (Q209) and GNA11 (Q209) with a multiplexPCR and capillary electrophoresis-based assay termed
SNaPshot (Supplementary Table S1) [25]. Herein, we
used SNaPshot to identify melanoma cell lines that were
pan-negative by this assay (Supplementary Table S2). To
determine potential differences in the sensitivity of pannegative melanomas to MEK1/2 inhibition, we treated an
initial collection of six SNaPshot pan-negative melanoma
cell lines (Supplementary Table S3) with the clinicallyavailable MEK1/2 inhibitor, trametinib, and calculated the
average IC50 for each in comparison to a well-described
BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma line, SK-Mel-28.
Interestingly, we observed two distinct responses. Three
pan-negative lines were highly sensitive to trametinib with
IC50’s relatively similar to SK-Mel-28 (BRAF V600mutant) and well below the Cmax for trametinib (36.1 nM,
[26]). The other three pan-negative lines exhibited IC50’s
at or above the Cmax of trametinib (Figure 1A). When we
investigated MAPK pathway signaling in these six cell
lines following treatment with trametinib, the lines less
sensitive to trametinib displayed paradoxical activation
of MEK1/2 (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1).
To distinguish between the two groups, we herein termed
the two MEK1/2-inhibitor response groups as Class I and
Class II, respectively.
Paradoxical MEK1/2 activation following MEK1/2
inhibitor administration has been reported previously
in the setting of a Ras mutation [27, 28], a BRAF
V600 mutation and concurrent MEK1 mutation [29],
or BRAF amplification and MEK2 mutation [30, 31]
(Supplementary Table S4). Targeted next-generation
sequencing (Vanderbilt Cancer Panel for MiSeq and
MSKCC IMPACT Assay, refer to Supplementary
Materials and Methods and Supplementary Tables S5
and S6, and see [32]) did not detect any RAS G12, G13,
or Q61 codon mutations (NRAS, KRAS or HRAS) or
MEK1/2 (a.k.a. MAP2K1, MAP2K2) mutations in the six
pan-negative melanoma cell lines. A non-canonical BRAF
N581Y alteration was detected by IMPACT analysis in
WM3912. This alteration is predicted to induce modest
BRAF kinase activity, but is poorly characterized [33, 34]
(Supplementary Table S6). Although RAS activity in both
classes was slightly less than that of an NRAS-mutant cell
line, we observed no significant difference in RAS activity
between the two pan-negative classes (Supplementary
Figure S2).

Class II pan-negative melanoma lines exhibit
active ERBB receptors

Class II pan-negative melanoma lines are
sensitive to EGFR small-molecule inhibition

A previous study of cancer cells not specific to
melanoma reported paradoxical activation of MEK1/2
upon MEK1/2 inhibition in a BRAF-/NRAS-wild-type
setting, citing that signaling in these cells is regulated by
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) [35] (Supplementary
Table S4). We investigated the RTK status of Class
I and II lines by commercial phosphorylated RTK array
and immunoblotting analysis. The phospho-RTK array
indicated that all lines exhibited some degree of low-level
EGFR activity (Supplementary Figure S3A), but only Class
II lines displayed activation of HER2/ERBB2 and HER3/
ERBB3 receptors. Subsequent immunoblotting analysis
confirmed that only Class II lines exhibited endogenous
levels of phosphorylated EGFR, HER2 and HER3 receptors
(Figure 2A). There were no stark differences in expression
of total EGFR, HER2 and HER3 between Class I and II
cells, though Class II cells may harbor slightly increased
levels of these proteins (Supplementary Figure 3B). ERBBphosphorylated Class II lines also displayed elevated levels
of phosphorylated AKT, suggesting that Class II cells may
be dependent not only on MAPK pathway signaling, but
also the PI3K/AKT pathway.

Because Class II lines demonstrated active EGFR,
HER2 and HER3, we next investigated their potential
sensitivity to the ERBB-targeting small molecule inhibitors,
afatinib (irreversible, inhibits EGFR > HER2 > HER3) and
lapatinib (reversible, inhibits HER2 > EGFR). Cell viability
and proliferation analyses confirmed that only Class II lines
were sensitive to afatinib and lapatinib, whereas Class
I cells were resistant to either agent (afatinib, Figure 2B,
Supplementary Figures S4A, S4B; lapatinib, data not
shown). Additionally, treatment with single-agent afatinib
ablated AKT phosphorylation in Class II lines (Figure 2C).
To determine whether Class II cells would be
more sensitive to combined inhibition of the ERBBs and
MEK1/2, we administered both afatinib and trametinib to
the Class II cells. The combination had some effect on cell
viability (Supplementary Figures S4A, S4B), and enhanced
inhibition of proliferation in Class II cells, while no added
effect was observed in Class I cell proliferation (Figure 2B).
Furthermore, combined inhibition of ERBBs and MEK1/2
attenuated both AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, causing
a slight increase in levels of the pro-apoptotic protein, BIM,
in Class II cells (Figure 2C, Supplementray Figure S4C).

(DMSO), 50 nM trametinib, 50 nM afatinib, or the combination, only the Class II lines are sensitive to single-agent afatinib. Additionally,
the combination is more effective at inhibiting proliferation of Class II cells than either single agent. C. Immunoblotting analysis of Class
I and II cells following treatment with DMSO, 50 nM trametinib, 50 nM afatinib or the combination shows that phosphorylation of EGFR,

these lines. nM, nanomolar; p, phosphorylated; tra, trametinib; afat, afatinib. p-values for Figure 2B were calculated using Student’s T-test,

ERBB and AKT activation status may predict
sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition

of phosphorylated ERBBs 1, 2, and 3 and phosphorylated
AKT as observed by immunoblot analysis across the 16
lines (Figure 3C) revealed that Class I-like lines with
high sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition displayed very
little to no phosphorylated ERBBs or AKT. Among
Class II-like lines, the only lines sensitive to afatinib
were CHL-1, HMCB, and MeWo, which, in addition to
ERBB phosphorylation, also exhibited activated AKT. In
contrast, while WM3918 cells expressed high phosphoEGFR, they were not responsive to afatinib and lacked
phosphorylated AKT. Further, no EGFR, HER2 or HER3
mutations were identified in this cell line by the MSKCC
IMPACT assay that would lead to afatinib resistance
(Supplementary Table S6). The other Class II-like
lines (WM1382, VP-Mel-20, VP-Mel-21) exhibited no
phospho-ERBBs but had high or intermediate activation
of AKT. Notably, two lines (VP-Mel-20 and WM3681)
were susceptible to neither ERBB nor MEK1/2 inhibition.

To determine the frequency of ERBB activation
in pan-negative melanomas, we expanded our cohort
to 10 additional SNaPshot pan-negative lines (16 total)
from various institutions (Supplementary Table S3).
Interrogation of the phospho-ERBB status of these 10
lines by immunoblot analysis revealed one additional
line (WM3918) with clearly active EGFR, HER2 and
HER3 (Figure 3A). None of the additional lines were
sensitive to afatinib (Figure 3B). Five of the additional
lines (VP-Mel-36, WM3928F, M375, D35, MM329)
displayed a Class I phenotype in that they were highly
sensitive to trametinib (IC50 << trametinib Cmax) but
resistant to afatinib, indicating that 8 of 16 (50%) of
these pan-negative melanoma cell lines were Class I-like.

Clearly, there may be sub-classes within the Class I, 
Class II designations that are influenced by other, as yet
undetermined signaling pathways.
We should note that the IMPACT assay detected
non-canonical BRAF alterations in VP-Mel-20 (G469R),
VP-Mel-21 (N581I), and as reported above, in WM3912
(N581Y) (Supplementary Table S6). These mutations
are reported to confer MAPK pathway activity but to a
lesser extent than a BRAF V600 alteration [3, 33, 34].
Previously, it has been shown that a cell line harboring
both BRAF G469A and BRAF L584F was sensitive
to the BRAF V600-mutant inhibitor, vemurafenib, but
insensitive to trametinib [36], which is consistent with
our findings. Limited data are available regarding the
sensitivity of tumors harboring the N581 alteration to such
inhibitors. Our results suggest this particular mutation may
have no bearing on whether a melanoma is Class I or II, as
one N581-mutant cell line was represented in each class
(Figure 3C).
In summary, 8 of 16 (50%) pan-negative cell lines
displayed a Class I phenotype. Of the lines with decreased
sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition (Class II phenotype),
ERBB activity was observed in 4 of these 16 lines (25%),
and 3 (18.8% of total) were sensitive to afatinib. Because
~30% of melanomas are currently considered pannegative, one could extrapolate that ~6% of all melanomas
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are Class II-like, however, future studies with clinical
specimens will provide more robust evidence.

Lack of DUSP4 is a potential mechanism for
ERBB activation in class II melanomas
RTK-activated cancers, unlike BRAF V600Eactivated cancers, may harbor lower levels of the ERK1/2
phosphatase, DUSP4 [35]. To determine whether this was
the case in Class II pan-negative melanomas, we analyzed
the six original Class I & II cells by immunoblot analysis
and observed DUSP4 expression existed primarily in
Class I cells, whereas Class II cells harbored little to no
DUSP4 expression (Figure 4A). Immunohistochemical
analysis of BRAF-mutant, NRAS-mutant and pannegative patient melanomas revealed wide heterogeneity
of DUSP4 expression in each subtype. Consistent with our
in vitro data and Class I/Class II subtyping, a large number
of pan-negative tumors exhibited no DUSP4 expression
(Figure 4B). Although differences in EGFR expression
were difficult to show in Class I and II cell lines, Class
II lines potentially harbored greater levels of HER2 and
HER3 than Class I lines. RNA sequencing analysis of
DUSP4, EGFR, HER2 and HER3 expression in pannegative melanomas genotyped through The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed an inverse relationship
between DUSP4 and EGFR expression (p-value = 0.03978)

Figure 4: Lack of DUSP4 is a Potential Mechanism for ERBB Activation in Class II Melanomas. A. Immunoblot analysis

of DUSP4 expression in Class I and II pan-negative melanomas reveals that Class II melanomas express little or no DUSP4 compared with
Class I melanomas. B. Plot of H-scores for immunohistochemistry against DUSP4 in 15 BRAF-mutant, 17 NRAS-mutant and 42 pan-negative
melanomas on a patient tissue microarray (TMA) reveals a wide distribution of DUSP4 expression in all three subsets, but a trend toward lower
overall DUSP4 expression in the pan-negative group. C. Restoring DUSP4 expression in Class II melanoma lines by adenovirus infection leads
to a reduction in active EGFR and HER3. D. By protein array, amphiregulin (AREG) levels are higher in Class II melanomas compared with
Class I melanomas, which was confirmed by ELISA, shown here. Serum-free media and conditioned media from HCT116 cells were used as
negative and positive controls, respectively. The p-value was calculated by Student’s T-test assuming unequal variances. E. Restoring DUSP4
in Class II cells decreases the expression of AREG in MeWo and HMCB Class II cell lines. The p-value was calculated by Student’s T-test
assuming equal variances. adv, adenovirus; ctrl, control; SF media, serum-free media, p, phosphorylated.

(Supplementary Figure S5). Interestingly, when DUSP4
was restored in Class II cells, EGFR and HER3 activation
was diminished by 48 hours (Figure 4C).
Once activated, ERK1/2 can serve as a transcriptional
co-regulator of various proteins, including ERBB ligands
[37]. Since DUSP4 negatively regulates ERK1/2 activity,
ERK1/2-mediated transcription of ERBB ligands may be
altered between Class I and II cell lines. Therefore, we
examined whether Class II cells secreted higher levels
of ERBB ligands compared to Class I cells. Analysis
of conditioned media for four of seven ERBB ligands
(epidermal growth factor, EGF; heparin-binding epidermal
growth factor, HB-EGF; heregulin / neuregulin β1, HRG /
NRGβ1; amphiregulin, AREG) by protein array revealed
potentially higher levels of HB-EGF and AREG in Class
II cells (Supplementary Figure S6A, S6B). Subsequent
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for HBEGF and AREG confirmed upregulation of AREG without
clear differences in HB-EGF expression (Figure 4D,
Supplementary Figure S6C). In addition to suppressing
ERBB activity, DUSP4 restoration in Class II cells
decreased AREG expression in two of the three Class II
cell lines (Figure 4E). These data suggest that a potential
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanism of constitutive ERBB activation in Class II
cells may be associated with lower levels of DUSP4, which
allows for ERK1/2-mediated transcription of ERBB ligands.

DISCUSSION
The identification of MAPK-pathway activating
driver mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ and GNA11
in melanoma has revolutionized the treatment of this
disease beyond standard chemotherapy to include targeted,
small-molecule inhibitors such as vemurafenib, dabrafenib,
imatinib, nilotinib and trametinib. Unfortunately, only twothirds of patients harbor these drivers, leaving the remaining
one-third of “pan-negative” patients with no targeted
treatment option. Since melanoma is widely considered to
be dependent on MAPK pathway signaling for its growth
and survival, we sought to determine if there are subsets of
pan-negative melanoma that display differential sensitivities
to MAPK pathway inhibition in order to ultimately identify
novel therapeutic options for patients.
We ascertained that there are two possible MEK1/2inhibitor response “classes” within pan-negative
melanomas (Table 1, Figure 5): Class I pan-negative

Figure 5: Summary of Class I and Class II Pan-Negative Melanomas. A. Class I pan-negative melanomas are primarily driven

by the MAPK pathway and express generally robust levels of the ERK1/2 phosphatase, DUSP4, but have no endogenously active ERBB
receptors. Class I melanomas behave similarly to BRAF V600-mutant melanomas in that they are highly sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibition.
B. Class II pan-negative melanomas are activated by ERBB receptors, which activate both MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, making them
less susceptible to MEK1/2 inhibition than Class I melanomas, but more susceptible to combined inhibition of ERBBs and MEK1/2. A
potential mechanism for the ERBB activity in Class II’s is the relative lack of DUSP4 expression, presumably allowing ERK1/2-mediated
transcription of ERBB ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG). C. This pie chart displays the breakdown of driver events that sustain
melanoma. Our study has shown that 4 pan-negative melanomas display ERBB activation (25%), but only 3 of those (18.8%) were sensitive
to ERBB inhibition which can be extrapolated to ~6% of all melanomas.

22354

pan-negative melanomas did not harbor mutations in
MEK1 or 2 [29–31], nor did they display increased RAS
activity [27, 28], both of which are implicated in previous
citings of paradoxical MEK1/2 activation upon MEK1/2
inhibition, specifically in the BRAF V600-mutant setting
(Supplementary Table S4). Another study, however,
suggested that tumors driven by receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) would exhibit paradoxical MEK1/2 activation
after MEK1/2 inhibition [35]. Interestingly, only the Class
II pan-negative responders displayed basal activation of
EGFR, HER2 and HER3, associated with phosphorylation
of downstream AKT (Figure 2). Importantly, we show that
Class II cells respond well to the EGFR > HER3 > HER2
inhibitor, afatinib, and combining afatinib with trametinib
elicits even greater effects on proliferation and signaling
than either single agent (Figure 2B, 2C). We also reveal
that a potential mechanism of heightened ERBB activity
in Class II pan-negative melanomas is the relative lack
of DUSP4 expression, a negative regulator of ERK1/2
(Figure 4). By restoring expression of DUSP4 in these
cells, both amphiregulin (AREG) expression and ERBB
activity was diminished (Figure 4C, 4E). Consistent
with our in vitro data, analysis of tissue microarrays
and RNA sequencing expression data from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a wide distribution of
DUSP4 expression in pan-negative samples (Figure 4B)
and an inverse relationship between DUSP4 and EGFR
expression (Supplementary Figure S5).
In addition to identifying ERBB activation in
some pan-negative melanomas, interrogation of a larger
panel of pan-negative melanoma cell lines revealed
the potential for non-ERBB-dependent mechanisms
of MEK1/2 inhibitor resistance as well (Figure 3). For
example, although WM3918 cells were Class II-like in
their limited response to trametinib, unlike the other Class
II lines with ERBB activity, WM3918 did not respond to
afatinib. Since these cells did not display phosphorylated
AKT and did not harbor ERBB mutations known to cause
resistance to this agent, they may be dependent on other,
as yet unidentified, signaling pathways in addition to the
MAPK pathway. Furthermore, the pan-negative lines
VP-Mel-20 and WM3681 were resistant to both MEK1/2
and ERBB inhibition. Studies are ongoing to determine
the pathway(s) and mechanism(s) that distinguish these
melanomas from our proposed Class I / Class II subtypes.
One possible explanation for differences in MEK1/2
inhibitor response may relate to MITF and/or AXL
expression levels. In the BRAF V600-mutant setting,
low AXL/ high MITF expression was shown to correlate
well with MEK1/2 inhibitor sensitivity [38, 39]. To our
knowledge, differences in this signaling axis have not been
specifically interrogated in the setting of pan-negative
melanoma.
Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
and specifically, ERBBs, through mutation [40–46] or
amplification/overexpression [47–51] represent major
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hallmarks of cancers such as lung and breast. Unlike these
cancer types, RTK/ERBB amplification/overexpression
is not considered an intrinsic characteristic of melanoma.
Furthermore, previous pre-clinical studies investigating
the potential for ERBB inhibition in this disease never
correlated genotype (BRAF-mutant, NRAS-mutant,
or pan-negative) to ERBB activation and/or response
to ERBB-directed therapy as we have [52, 53]. ERBB
inhibitors, potentially in combination with RAF inhibitors,
may prove useful in the setting of acquired resistance to
RAF inhibitors in BRAF V600-mutant melanoma [54–58],
but acquired resistance to first-line therapy was not a focus
of our study.
To our knowledge, only one clinical trial exists
that evaluated ERBB inhibition in melanoma. This phase
II trial investigated the efficacy of gefitinib, an EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in a population of 48 patients
with melanoma, unselected for genotype [59]. Although
the median progression-free and overall survival figures
were 1.4 and 9.7 months, respectively, there were two
partial responders (4%) with a medium duration of
response of 10.9 months. For comparison, the median
progression-free survival of BRAF V600-mutant patients
on vemurafenib is 6.8 months [12]. It is possible that these
two “exceptional responders” had Class II-like melanoma,
harboring activated EGFR. Unfortunately, we were unable
to obtain tumor specimens from these two responders to
further investigate their ERBB and/or DUSP4 status.
Notably, however, this figure supports our data, suggesting
that perhaps 6% of melanomas are pan-negative with
ERBB activation (Figure 5C). Again, these theories would
benefit from future analysis of clinical specimens.
Our study helps further define a potential role for
ERBB activity in pan-negative melanoma and how that
activity might modulate therapeutic responses, specifically
to MEK1/2 inhibitors. Our observation of endogenous
ERBB activity and resultant sensitivity to ERBB inhibition
in 3 of 4 Class II-like pan-negative lines suggests that
ERBB inhibitors may be efficacious in this disease,
potentially in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors.
In line with these endeavors, it will be important
to determine the appropriate clinical test by which
to identify Class II patients. Because this phenotype
is not represented by a single driver mutation (point
mutation, insertion, deletion, etc), the assay must
detect differences in protein levels between tumor
and normal tissues. Next-generation whole-genome
or RNA sequencing analyses are certainly useful, but
cannot provide protein expression or phosphorylation
information. Immunohistochemical (IHC) methods, both
traditional and quantitative [60], may be more suitable.
Because an inverse relationship between total EGFR
and DUSP4 expression was observed in TCGA RNA
sequencing data (Supplementary Figure S5), samples
could be analyzed for total levels of EGFR and DUSP4.
Mass cytometry (a.k.a. CyTOF) alternatively has several
22355

advantages over traditional IHC methods. Not only does
mass cytometry allow for highly quantitative, single-cell
analyses of either a few or several targets, but it is also
useful for phospho-protein analyses [61]. Furthermore,
mass cytometry has the ability to analyze live, singlecell suspensions as well as image whole fixed tissues.
Ideally, CyTOF could be used to compare the levels of
phosphorylated ERBBs, phosphorylated AKT, and total
DUSP4 levels in tumor and matched normal samples
from each patient.
In summary, we have identified a subset of pannegative melanoma with reduced sensitivity to MEK1/2
inhibition that is mediated by an axis involving ERBB
activation/DUSP4 expression. Interrogation of a large
number of pan-negative melanoma cell lines for ERBB
activity and sensitivity to trametinib or afatinib revealed
that this Class II phenotype potentially represents 18.8%
of pan-negative melanomas, or ~6% of all melanomas.
As stated above, this number is supported by a phase
II clinical trial evaluating gefitinib in melanoma in
which 4% of the population exhibited responses [59].
Furthermore, these data suggest that ERBB inhibition
may be a therapeutic option for a subset of patients whose
melanomas are considered pan-negative.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
The sources and culturing conditions of all 16 pannegative melanoma lines are listed in Supplementary
Table S3. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was heat-inactivated
(Atlanta Biologicals) and the penicillin-streptomycin
solution was at a final concentration of 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Mediatech).
RPMI-1640 (Mediatech #MT10040 CV), DMEM
(Gibco/Life Technologies #11965). SK-Mel-28 was
provided through MTA with Christine Pratilas (Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) to Kimberly Dahlman
(Vanderbilt) and cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS +
1% pen/strep. Wistar Institute cell lines were cultured
in a solution of 4 parts MCDB-153 media (Sigma,
#M7403) to 1 part Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Gibco/Life
Technologies, #11415–064) and also containing 2% FBS,
1% pen/strep, 5 ug/mL bovine insulin (Sigma # I5500),
and 1.68 mM calcium chloride (VWR #97062–586). The
HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line was kindly provided
by Robert Coffey (Vanderbilt) and cultured in RPMI +
10% FBS + 1% pen/strep. VP-Mel cell lines were derived
from patient melanomas; patients gave consent for the
use of their tissue under VICC-MEL0287. All cells
were tested in-house for mycoplasma contamination and
confirmed to be negative. Additionally, all melanoma cell
lines were subjected to the Vanderbilt SNaPshot assay
for melanoma (Supplementary Table S2), which has been
described previously [25] and recently updated to include
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Growth inhibition assays
Cells were seeded at 3,000 cells per well of a
96-well plate. Following 4- or 5- day treatment with
DMSO or increasing doses of drug in sextuplicate, Cell
Titer Blue reagent (Promega) was added to each well
and fluorescence was measured as per manufacturer’s
instructions on a BioTek microplate reader.

Immunoblotting
All cells were lysed on ice using standard RIPA
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1%
IGEPAL/NP-40 substitute; 0.1% SDS) and supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche
Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor cocktail tablet, EDTAfree, used as per manufacturer’s instructions; 40 mM
sodium fluoride; 1 mM sodium orthovanadate; 1 μM
okadaic acid). Cells were not allowed to reach >85–90%
confluence before harvesting. Lysates were quantified by
Bradford assay and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–12%
Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Following
transfer to PVDF membranes, immunoblot analysis
was performed using antibodies against the indicated
targets. Membranes were incubated in chemiluminescent
reagents (Perkin Elmer) and exposed to film for signal
detection.

Cells were plated evenly into 6-cm dishes in serumcontaining media. The following day, media was replaced
with a solution of 1.5 μL of a control GFP adenovirus
or DUSP4-containing adenovirus, 500 μL of serum-free
media, and 50 uL of 1 M HEPES solution (25 mM final
concentration). Plates were rocked every 15 minutes
for 1 hr. Finally, 1.5 mL serum-containing media was
added to each plate (total volume ~2 mL). 24 hr after
adenovirus infection, cells were treated with DMSO
or 50 nM trametinib for 24 hr. Cells were harvested for
immunoblotting or serum-free conditioned media was
harvested for ELISAs as described in other sections.

One day following even seeding into 6-cm dishes,
serum-containing culture media was replaced with serumfree culture media. After 48 hr, the conditioned media was
harvested, spun at 4°C to pellet loose cells/debris, and used as
per manufacturer’s instructions for the HB-EGF and AREG
ELISAs (Abcam, ab100531 and ab99975, respectively).

Tissue microarray (TMA)
immunohistochemistry for DUSP4
The melanoma TMA was created using formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 17 BRAF-mutant
(14 V600E, 3 V600K), 17 NRAS (8 Q61R, 4 Q61K, 2
Q61L, 1 Q61H, 1 G13V, 1 G12C) and 49 pan-negative
melanoma patients seen at Vanderbilt. All patient tissues
were reviewed for ≥50% tumor content and assessed using
the Vanderbilt melanoma SNaPshot assay [25] to confirm
mutation status. Immunohistochemistry was performed for
DUSP4 (Cell Signaling #5149) as described previously [62]
according to the following parameters: antigen retrieval
using citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (decloaking chamber); dilution
of 1:400; overnight incubation at 4°C; and the Envision
Visualization System from Dako. Tumor regions stained for
nuclear DUSP4 were assessed using a four value intensity
scale (0 to 3) and percentage extent (0 to 100%). The
H-score was calculated by summing the products of both
parameters (range 0–300). The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum
test was applied to the TMA data and post hoc analyses
were performed for pair-wise comparisons among the three
groups (BRAF-mutant, NRAS-mutant or pan-negative).
