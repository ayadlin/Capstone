Phenotypic Proﬁling of DPYD Variations Relevant to
5-Fluorouracil Sensitivity Using Real-time Cellular Analysis
and In Vitro Measurement of Enzyme Activity
Steven M. Offer, Natalie J. Wegner, Croix Fossum, Kangsheng Wang, and Robert B. Diasio

Abstract
In the 45 years since its development, the pyrimidine analog 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) has become an integral
component of many cancer treatments, most notably for the management of colorectal cancer. An appreciable
fraction of patients who receive 5-FU suffer severe adverse toxicities, which in extreme cases may result in death.
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, encoded by DPYD) rapidly degrades 85% of administered 5-FU, and as
such, limits the amount of drug available for conversion into active metabolites. Clinical studies have suggested
that genetic variations in DPYD increase the risk for 5-FU toxicity, however, there is not a clear consensus about
which variations are relevant predictors. In the present study, DPYD variants were expressed in mammalian cells,
and the enzymatic activity of expressed protein was determined relative to wild-type (WT). Relative sensitivity to
5-FU for cells expressing DPYD variations was also measured. The DPYD 2A variant (exon 14 deletion caused by
IVS14þ1G>A) was conﬁrmed to be catalytically inactive. Compared with WT, two variants, S534N and C29R,
showed signiﬁcantly higher enzymatic activity. Cells expressing S534N were more resistant to 5-FU–mediated
toxicity compared with cells expressing WT DPYD. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that selected DPYD
alleles are protective against severe 5-FU toxicity, and, as a consequence, may decrease the effectiveness of 5-FU an
antitumor drug in carriers. In addition, this study shows a method that may be useful for phenotyping other
genetic variations in pharmacologically relevant pathways. Cancer Res; 73(6); 1958–68. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The pyrimidine analog 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrug
capecitabine are frequently prescribed for the treatment of
aggressive cancers, particularly those of the colon and breast.
Like many chemotherapy drugs, 5-FU has a narrow therapeutic
index, with a very small difference between effective and toxic
doses (1). 5-FU is converted to active and inactive metabolites
by the uracil anabolic and catabolic pathways, respectively (2,
3). Anabolism of 5-FU generates cytotoxic metabolites that
inhibit production of thymidine and uridine and are incorporated during DNA and RNA synthesis (reviewed in ref. 4). Only
1% to 3% of administered 5-FU enters the anabolic pathway; the
vast majority (approximately 85%) is catabolized in the liver (3).
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, encoded by the
DPYD gene) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the uracil
catabolic pathway, and as such has a pivotal role in determining the clearance rate and circulating half-life of 5-FU (5, 6).

Early studies showed that DPD deﬁciency prolonged the
half-life of 5-FU by approximately 10-fold (5, 7, 8) and correlated with adverse responses in those treated with the standard
dose of the drug (8–10). Complete deﬁciency of DPD manifests
during childhood as a rare neurologic disorder (11–13). Partial
deﬁciency is more common and presents as a toxic response
(grade 3) to the standard dose of 5-FU (8, 9). These adverse
responses range in severity and include diarrhea, hand-foot
syndrome, stomatitis, mucositis, myelosuppression, neurotoxicity, and, in extreme cases, death (14).
Genetic variations in DPYD have been identiﬁed as a major
contributor to DPD deﬁciency. The most studied DPYD variation,  2A (rs3918290, a G>A base change at the splice acceptor
sequence for exon 14), signiﬁcantly reduces the enzyme activity
of the translated protein and has been shown to prolong the
clearance of 5-FU leading to increased occurrence of severe
toxicity and occasionally death (15, 16). In addition to  2A, 96
nonsynonymous and 2 frameshift variations have been
reported for DPYD (17). For many DPYD variations, clinical
studies have yielded unclear or contradicting results pertaining
to their contribution to severe 5-FU toxicity (18).
The objective of the present study was to develop and
validate a cellular model system that would allow rapid phenotypic assessment of DPYD variations for sensitivity to 5-FU.
In this study, DPYD alleles were expressed in a human cell line,
and enzyme activity of the expressed protein was directly
quantiﬁed. Sensitivity to 5-FU was measured using real-time
cellular analysis (RTCA) of cells expressing DPYD variations.

S534N Variant of DPYD Protects against 5-FU Toxicity

Using the developed system, we have functionally classiﬁed
several commonly studied DPYD alleles. Of the variants studied, 2 showed signiﬁcantly higher levels of enzyme activity
compared with wild-type (WT). This ﬁnding suggests that
individuals carrying these alleles may be protected against
adverse toxicity to 5-FU at the expense of reduced drug efﬁcacy
at the standard dose.

Materials and Methods
Cells
A protein expression screen of commonly used laboratory
cell lines showed that DPD was not detectible in HEK293T
clone 17 (HEK293T/c17) and HCT116 cells (data not shown).
Low passage HEK293T/c17 cells were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; culture CRL-11268) and
grown using standard cell culture conditions of 37 C and 5%
CO2 in a humidiﬁed incubator using Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Denville Scientiﬁc), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin (Mediatech). HCT116 cells were obtained
from ATCC (culture CCL-247) and cultured in McCoys 5A
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin,
and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
ATCC routinely authenticates cell lines in their repository
using short tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling, cell morphology
monitoring, karyotyping, and cytochrome C oxidase I (COI)
testing. Upon receipt from ATCC, cell lines were observed
microscopically to conﬁrm morphology, and population-doubling times were determined by daily counting of viable cells
using the Trypan blue dye exclusion method. Low passage
stocks of both cells lines were prepared and stored in liquid
nitrogen within 2 weeks of receipt from ATCC. For experimental use, cell stocks were thawed and maintained in
culture for no longer than 2 months or a total of 10 passages.
Cell lines were periodically monitored for mycoplasma by
Hoechst staining (Sigma-Aldrich). Culture identity and health
were monitored by microscopy and by comparing the population doubling times to baseline values determined for the
original cell stock received. Culture health was additionally
monitored for RTCA experiments as described by Irelan and
colleagues (19).
Vector construction
Human DPYD was cloned into the pIRES-neo3 expression
vector (Clontech) using the Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Roche).
The  2A, C29R, S534N, I543V, I560S, and V732I variant
constructs were generated using the Phusion Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Finnzymes) using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Plasmid sequences were conﬁrmed at
the Mayo Clinic Advanced Genomics Technology Center
(Rochester, MN) using primers listed in Supplementary
Table S2. DPYD variants were subcloned back into parental
pIRES-neo3 and reconﬁrmed to eliminate potential spurious
mutations introduced into the vector backbone during PCR.
Endotoxin-free plasmid DNA was prepared for transfections
using the NucleoBond Extra Midi EF Kit (Macherey-Nagel).
The pIRES-neo3 vector was used as an "empty vector"
control where indicated.

DPD enzyme activity assay
Low passage HEK293T/c17 cells were seeded at a density of
3  106 per 10-cm plates and transfected after 16 hours with
5 mg plasmid DNA using FuGene HD (Roche). Total protein
lysates were prepared 48 hours following transfection. Cells
were trypsinized (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mmol/L EDTA;
Mediatech), washed with PBS, and resuspended in buffer
consisting of 35 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer at pH
7.4 supplemented with 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.035% 2-mercaptoethanol, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail at the concentration recommended by manufacturer
(Roche). Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice and cleared
of debris by centrifugation. Total protein concentration was
determined using the BioRad Protein Assay. Lysates were
diluted to a standard concentration and stored at 80 C.
Enzyme activity was determined using a modiﬁcation of a
method described earlier by our laboratory (20). Lysates
were incubated with 20 mmol/L NADPH (Sigma) and 825
nmol/L [6-C14]-5-ﬂuorouracil ([6-C14]-5-FU; Moravek Biochemicals) for 30 minutes at 37 C with constant agitation.
Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equivalent
volume of ice-cold 100% ethanol, and samples were then
frozen at 80 C. Precipitated material was removed by
centrifugation and ﬁltering through a 0.2 mm polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) Mini-UniPrep syringeless ﬁlter (Whatman). Conversion of [6-C14]-FU to [6-C14]-5-dihydroﬂuorouracil ([6-C14]-5-DHFU) was determined using two reversephase C18 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
columns (Grace) connected in serial to a PerkinElmer Radiomatic 625TR ﬂow scintillation analyzer. DPD activity was
calculated by measuring the percentage region of interest as
the area under the curve for ([6-C14]-5-DHFU)/([6-C14]-5-FU
þ [6-C14]-5-DHFU) using ProFSA software. Biologic replicates were normalized by z-scores and sample groups compared using two-tailed Student t tests.
Western blotting
Protein lysates were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel
and transferred to PVDF-FL membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked using Odyssey blocking buffer (LICOR). Blots were probed with primary antibodies against
DPD and a-tubulin (both AbCam) and subsequent secondary IRDye800-conjugated goat anti-mouse and IRDye 680conjugated goat anti-rabbit (both LI-COR). Blots were
scanned and band intensities quantiﬁed using the LI-COR
Odyssey Infrared Imaging system.
Cell viability assays
HEK293T/c17 cells were seeded with a target density of
1  104 cells per well of a 96-well plate. After incubation for
16 hours, cultures were transfected with the indicated expression vectors. Media was removed 24 hours after transfection
and replaced with media containing serial dilutions of 5-FU
ranging from 1 nmol/L to 20 mmol/L. Viable cell counts were
estimated using CellTiter-Blue (Promega) 48 hours after treatment as an indicator of cell proliferation. IC50 was determined
by ﬁtting data using a logistic 4P nonlinear model (JMP, SAS
Institute Inc.).

Real-time cellular analysis
Cell settlement, morphology, and proliferation were monitored in real-time using an xCELLigence RTCA system (Acea
Biosciences). This instrument uses an electrical current that is
sent through gold electrodes located on the ﬂoor of each well at
deﬁned time intervals and the electrical impedances recorded.
The electrical impedance readouts are expressed in terms of an
arbitrary unit, the cell index, and are displayed as kinetic curves.
At each time point, the cell index is calculated by Zx  Zy/Zy,
where Zx is the electrical impedance of the electronic sensor in
a particular well containing cells and Zy is the background
impedance of medium alone in that particular well.
Before seeding cells, 50 mL media was added to each RTCA
plate well and the plates scanned on the xCELLigence to
generate a background reading. HEK293T/c17 cells were seeded with a target density of 5  103 cells in 150 mL media per well.
Cells were incubated on the xCELLigence in standard cell
culture conditions, and cell index recorded at 15 minute
intervals. After 20 to 24 hours of culture, cells were transfected
with the indicated plasmid amounts in a 1:3 ratio using FuGene
HD (Roche). Following transfection, cell index was recorded
every 2 minutes for 8 hours and then every 15 minutes
thereafter. Approximately, 20 to 24 hours after transfection,
cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of 5-FU
(Sigma) or vehicle. Cell index was recorded every 2 minutes for
8 hours following treatment and every 15 minutes thereafter.
Objective determination of analysis time points from cell
index data
Cell index proﬁles were smoothed using a spline smoothing
algorithm with l ¼ 1,000. The l coefﬁcient was empirically
determined to adequately remove noise from data without
altering the overall shape of cell index proﬁles. The slope was
subsequently calculated between adjacent data points along
the smoothed cell index proﬁle and the resultant ﬁrst-order
derivative approximation proﬁle was plotted. The change in
slope (second derivative of the cell index proﬁle) was calculated
and used to deﬁne statistical endpoints for the slope proﬁle.
Time points were established following the initial surge in cell
index that occurred directly following the media change at the
time of 5-FU treatment. The "toxicity" time point was deﬁned as
the time when the second derivative of the cell index reached or
approached 0. In cases where the second derivative did not
reach 0, this time point was observed as a peak on the second
derivative curve. The "recovery" time point was similarly
deﬁned as the next time when the second derivative of the
cell index reached or approached 0. All data analyses and
transformations were conducted using JMP (SAS Institute Inc.).
Endpoint quantitation at the deﬁned time points
The cell index slope was determined for a given time point
using the ﬁrst-order derivative approximation of the smoothed
cell index proﬁle. Data were assessed using a 3-effect model to
compare the relative contributions of replicate, DPYD variation
and 5-FU treatment level (grouped by DPYD variation) to the
observed variability within the overall dataset. In cases where
replicate was shown to signiﬁcantly contribute to model error
(P < 0.05), data were normalized relative to that for the

1960

Cancer Res; 73(6) March 15, 2013

untreated culture expressing the same DPYD variation within
the replicate. In all cases where normalization was deemed
necessary, following normalization, replicate no longer contributed to the model variability. All data transformations and
analyses were conducted using JMP (SAS Institute Inc.).
Statistical tests
Speciﬁc statistical tests used for a given experiment are
described in the relevant methods subsection earlier. All data
analyses and transformations were conducted using JMP (SAS
Institute Inc.), unless otherwise noted.

Results
Development of an in vitro system to measure DPD
enzymatic activity
Expression constructs were generated to encode DPYD and a
mimic of the  2A splice product lacking the sequence corresponding to exon 14 (Fig. 1A). Constructs were transfected into
low passage HEK293T/c17 cells, and crude protein lysates were
harvested by sonication after 48 hours of culture. The total
protein concentrations of lysates were determined, and samples were diluted to a standard concentration for subsequent
analyses. The ability of lysates to catalyze the conversion of
radiolabeled 5-FU to DHFU was measured by HPLC as an
indicator of DPD enzyme activity (Fig. 1B). Lysates from cells
expressing WT DPYD were able to efﬁciently reduce 5-FU to
DHFU, whereas lysates from cells transfected with either the
empty vector control or the  2A variant did not show any 5-FU
conversion to DHFU (Fig. 1B). Expression of WT DPD protein
was similar to that of the  2A variant, and no endogenous DPD
expression as noted for cell lysates from cells transfected with
empty vector (Fig. 1C). Extending the reaction times to 24 hours
did not result in any detectible conversion of 5-FU for untransfected cells or for those expressing either the empty vector or

2A (data not shown), further suggesting that HEK293T/c17
cells lack detectible endogenous DPD enzyme activity.
To conﬁrm that the transgenically expressed DPD was
catalytically active in vivo, IC50 for 5-FU was determined (Fig.
1D). Cells transfected with WT DPYD showed signiﬁcantly
higher resistance to 5-FU than untransfected cells (IC50 ¼
8.4 and 3.0 mmol/L, respectively; P ¼ 0.0070). The IC50 for cells
transfected with the empty vector and  2A were 1.7 and 3.6
mmol/L 5-FU, respectively. These cells were signiﬁcantly more
sensitive to 5-FU than those expressing WT DPYD (P ¼ 0.0028
and P ¼ 0.0079). IC50 values were not signiﬁcantly different
between empty vector-expressing cells,  2A-expressing cells,
and nontransfected cells.
Selection of additional DPYD variants for further
functional analyses
We selected 5 additional DPYD variations for further study.
For each of these variants, allele frequencies in the HapMap
and 1,000 genomes populations are presented in Table 1 along
with a summary of references that are relevant to the previously reported contribution of each variation to 5-FU toxicity.
For ease of data interpretation, genetic variants are referred to
in this article by the amino acid change for which they encode.

referred to as DPYD 13) has consistently contributed to 5-FU
toxicity in clinical reports (21–24). The roles of the additional 4
selected variants in 5-FU–related toxicities are less clear. The
I543V variant (rs1801159, previously referred to as DPYD 5) is
widely considered to be a common polymorphism that has not
shown association with 5-FU toxicity (25–27), however, 2
reports suggest otherwise (28, 29). The S534N variant
(rs1801158, previously referred to as DPYD 4) has an unclear
association with 5-FU toxicity. While earlier studies suggested
this allele was linked to drug sensitivity (30–33), more recent
studies using large clinical cohorts have contradicted this

ﬁnding (18, 25–27). V732I (rs1801160, previously referred to
as DPYD 6) has been shown to contribute to 5-FU toxicity only
when the M166V variation (rs2297595) was not present (18).
Several other reports have shown no association with toxicity
for V732I (25–27). Finally, C29R (rs1801265, previously referred
to as DPYD 9A) was identiﬁed in a DPD-deﬁcient patient and
shown to be catalytically inactive (34, 35); however, clinical
studies have failed to establish a link between the variation and
5-FU sensitivity (25–27). Additional studies have suggested
that C29R may in fact serve as a protective allele against 5-FU
toxicity (18, 32).

D, representative immunoblot depicting equivalent expression of DPD variants used for C.

Relative DPD enzyme activity produced by each of the
selected DPYD variants
Each selected variant was transiently expressed and assayed
for DPD enzyme activity relative to that of WT and the
catalytically inactive  2A variation (Fig. 2A). The most striking
result was obtained for S534N, which was 36% more active
than WT (P ¼ 3.4  107). C29R was also signiﬁcantly hyperactive (P ¼ 0.0013), exhibiting 13% higher activity than WT. The
amino acid substitutions I543V and V732I did not signiﬁcantly
affect enzyme activity. Consistent with previous reports, the
I560S substitution impaired DPD enzyme function, showing a
75% reduction in activity relative to WT (P ¼ 5.2  109).
Each variant was expressed at a level similar to that of WT DPD
(Fig. 2B).
To conﬁrm that the observed results were not due to
saturation of the enzymatic reaction, varying amounts of
cellular lysate from cells transfected with empty vector, WT,

2A, I560S, and S534N were assayed for DPD activity (Fig.
2C). For all concentrations except the lowest tested, S534N
showed signiﬁcantly higher enzyme activity than that of WT
(minimum P ¼ 7.1  104). The activity of I560S was
intermediate between WT and  2A (minimum P ¼ 1.8 
106 and P ¼ 8.3  105, respectively). Enzyme activity in
lysate from cells expressing the  2A variant showed no
difference in activity compared with lysate from cells transfected with empty vector. All variants were equally expressed
(Fig. 2D). In addition, the rank order of variations was not
altered by changing the amount of DNA transfected (Sup-

plementary Fig. S1A and S1B) or when expressed in a second
cell line (HCT116 cells, data not shown).
DPYD variants determine 5-FU sensitivity
DPYD variant-expressing cells were continuously monitored
for changes in cell proliferation using RTCA to closely measure
the cellular responses following 5-FU treatment. The culture
plates that are used for RTCA are lined with gold electrodes
(Fig. 3A). A small electric current is passed through the culture
and the impedance recorded. These data are expressed in cell
index units. Changes in cell index can indicate a change in cell
number, morphology, and/or attachment. Cell death reduces
the impedance between electrodes and results in an overall
downward trend in the cell index proﬁle (Fig. 3B). Conversely,
cell proliferation is indicated by an increase in cell index.
To determine an appropriate number of cells to use in
subsequent experiments, various quantities of HEK293T/c17
cells were seeded into the wells of an RTCA plate (Fig. 3C). A
greater starting density of cells resulted in an earlier cell index
plateau, indicative of culture conﬂuency and/or nutrient limitation. On the basis of these results, a seeding density of 5,000
cells per well was chosen for subsequent experiments. To
determine the amount of vector that could be transfected
without inducing a change in the cell index proﬁle, varying
amounts of empty pIRES-neo3 vector were transfected in
parallel (Fig. 3D). Cells receiving 100 ng, and to a lesser extent
50 ng, showed altered cell index proﬁles relative to cells
transfected with either 25 or 12.5 ng plasmid (Fig. 3D). On the

Using the optimized parameters detailed earlier, cells were
transfected with vectors encoding WT DPYD or  2A and
subsequently treated with varying concentrations of 5-FU to

when treated with 2.2 or 20 mmol/L 5-FU. To determine
relevant treatment concentrations for subsequent studies, the
IC50 concentrations for 5-FU were determined. IC50 concentrations for WT and  2A were 6.9 and 3.9 mmol/L 5-FU,
respectively (Fig. 3G). These values were similar to those
obtained using a conventional means of measuring cellular
sensitivity to 5-FU (Fig. 1D).

RTCA classiﬁcation of selected DPYD variants by 5-FU
sensitivity
Given the unexpected hyperactivity that resulted from
changing amino acid 534 of DPD from serine to asparagine,
we decided to more closely study this variation using RTCA.
HEK293T/c17 cells were again plated on RTCA plates and
transfected as described for Fig. 3, except in addition to WT
DPYD and  2A, vectors encoding S534N and I560S were also
transfected in parallel (Fig. 4A). On the basis of the IC50 values
determined in Fig. 3, cells were treated with 3 concentrations of
5-FU (5, 10, and 20 mmol/L) and monitored for an extended
period of time (Fig. 4A). For each variant, an untreated control
was included. Experiments were carried out as 3 independent
biologic replicates, each consisting of 3 technical replicates. A
representative biologic replicate is presented in Fig. 4A. Relative to untreated cells, the cell index proﬁles for S534Nexpressing cells were higher than those for WT,  2A, or
I560S at each 5-FU treatment concentration (Fig. 4A). Cells
expressing  2A showed the greatest reduction in cell index
following 5-FU treatment relative to untreated. Overall, cell
index proﬁles for WT and I560S were similar, although cell
index values tended to be slightly higher for WT following
treatment with 5, 10, or 20 mmol/L 5-FU.
The separation between cell index proﬁles was not always
evident when using a single window of analysis deﬁned by the
kinetics of the untreated samples (Supplementary Fig. S2). To
better use the time-course data generated during RTCA, we
developed a series of data analysis methods in which relevant
measurement times were objectively determined for each sample using deﬁned characteristics of the cell index proﬁle. The
developed methods are detailed in the materials and methods
section and Supplementary Fig. S3. Brieﬂy, a smoothing algorithm was used to remove irregularities between adjacent points
within a cell index proﬁle without altering the overall shape of a
cell index proﬁle (Fig. 4B). The slope of the smoothed cell index
proﬁle at each time point collected was plotted and yielded 2
features common to all proﬁles following drug treatment (Fig.
4B). On the basis of the location along the cell index proﬁle for
these 2 features, they were termed "toxicity" and "recovery" time
points. The slope of the cell index proﬁle at these time points was
measured as a statistical endpoint.
The greatest differences in cell index slopes between treatments were noted for the analysis of the "toxicity" time point
(Supplementary Fig. S4, summarized in Fig. 4C). When treated
with 5 mmol/L 5-FU, cells expressing S534N had a signiﬁcantly
higher slope than those expressing WT, I560S, or  2A (Fig. 4C
and D). For cells treated with 10 mmol/L 5-FU, the toxicity slope
for S534N remained signiﬁcantly higher than that of WT, which
in turn was signiﬁcantly greater than that of I560S or  2A. Cells
treated with 20 mmol/L 5-FU showed largely similar responses
for this endpoint regardless of the DPYD variant expressed.
Comparing the cell index slope at the "recovery" time point,
signiﬁcant differences were also noted for drug treatment
levels and DPYD variants (Supplementary Fig. S5, summarized
in Fig. 4E and F). At the 5 mmol/L treatment level, the recovery
slope for S534N was signiﬁcantly higher than that for WT. WT
was not signiﬁcantly different than I560S; however, the slope
was signiﬁcantly higher than that of  2A. For cultures treated

1964

with 10 mmol/L 5-FU, WT and S534N were not signiﬁcantly
different from each other; however, both slopes were signiﬁcantly higher than those for I560S and  2A. The recovery slopes
were similar for S534N, WT, and I560S when treated with 20
mmol/L 5-FU. For each of the 3 treatments with 5-FU, the
recovery slope for  2A-expressing cells was signiﬁcantly lower
than that for any other constructs tested.
Evaluating variants expressed as heterozygous alleles
On the basis of the reported allele frequencies, all of the
variants studied are most often detected as heterozygotes.
Therefore, we sought to determine if the developed system
could be used to determine if variants signiﬁcantly altered
cellular sensitivity to 5-FU when coexpressed with WT DPYD
to mimic the heterozygous state. Cotransfection of plasmids
encoding WT and S534N resulted in enzyme activity mid way
between single transfections (Fig. 5A and B). Similar results
were obtained for cellular sensitivity to 5-FU by RTCA (Fig.
5C–F).

Discussion
In this report, we show a robust phenotypic assay to
functionally classify nonsynonymous coding variations in the
context of chemotherapy drug toxicity. The most striking
result in this study was obtained for the S534N variant, which
possessed greater enzymatic activity than WT in vitro and was
more protective against 5-FU toxicity when expressed in cells.
To a lesser extent, the more common C29R variation also
exhibited increased enzymatic activity. These ﬁndings support
a model in which hyperactive forms of DPD reduce mean
circulating levels of 5-FU by increased drug catabolism. Circulating levels of 5-FU have been correlated with clinical
toxicity (36, 37). Consistent with our model, clinical studies
by Seck and colleagues (32) and Kleibl and colleagues (18) have
suggested that C29R is protective against 5-FU toxicity. To our
knowledge, the less common S534N variation has not been
speciﬁcally evaluated as a hyperactive allele in clinical trials;
however, based on our results, we speculate that S534N may
also be protective against 5-FU toxicity. As a consequence of
increased drug clearance, hyperactive alleles may also reduce
the effectiveness of 5-FU as an antitumor drug.
The mildly hyperactive phenotype we observed for C29R
contradicts previous reports that have suggested that the
variant is catalytically inactive when expressed in Escherichia
coli (35, 38, 39). Bacteria lack many factors necessary for
efﬁcient folding and posttranslational modiﬁcation of large
multi-domain proteins such as DPD. In addition, eukaryotic
proteins produced in high levels in E. coli have been shown to
be subject to inactivation through aggregation into inclusion
bodies (40). The lack of enzyme activity for C29R previously
reported may have been an artifact of the bacterial expression
system used (35, 38, 39).
Structurally, amino acids 534 and 543 of DPD lie at opposite
ends of the loop-structure that covers the opening of the 5-FU
catabolic domain (Supplementary Fig. S6 and ref. 41). This
domain is a member of the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
(PyrD) conserved domain family (42). On the basis of the

Figure 5. Cotransfection studies to evaluate variants present as heterozygous alleles. A, the indicated quantities of expression plasmids for WT and S534N
were transfected into HEK293T/c17 cells and DPD enzyme activity determined for lysates. For cotransfections (S534N/WT), equal quantities of WT
and S534N expression plasmids were mixed, and the indicated amount of total plasmid was transfected. Error bars indicate SD of three independent
biological replicates. B, expression of DPD and a-tubulin was determined. A representative immunoblot is presented. C–F, HEK293T/c17 cells were seeded
onto RTCA plates and cultured for 24 hours, at which time they were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids or mixture of plasmids (S534N/WT).
After an additional 24 hours, cells were treated with 10 mmol/L (C) or 20 mmol/L (E) 5-FU. The boxed regions in C and E correspond to the enlarged
areas presented in D and F, respectively. Cell index data represent the average values for three technical replicates conducted in parallel and normalized
to 6 hours after 5-FU treatment using the D method.

conservation at the position corresponding to S534N within
the PyrD family, this variation is predicted to impact enzyme
function. The PolyPhen-2 (43) prediction for this amino acid
change is "probably damaging" with a dScore of þ2.13 based on
alignment with 106 homologs. The S534N substitution may
alter the localized protein structure through hydrogen bond
interactions between the asparagine side chain and the peptide
backbone. In contrast, the I543V variation is not predicted to
impact function as isoleucine and valine are chemically and
structurally similar. Given the location within the DPD structure and the increased rate of 5-FU catabolism for the S534N
variant, we postulate that this variation affects the structure of
the loop at the active site opening, and as a consequence,
increases substrate turnover.
To develop this phenotypic assay as a useful tool for genotype/
phenotype analysis, we studied 2 DPYD variations known to be
clinically associated with severe toxicity to 5-FU,  2A and I560S
(8). In our study, cells expressing either of these variants showed
signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation following treatment with 5FU. These results are consistent with the numerous clinical
reports showing that  2A is a null allele (15, 20, 44). The less
common I560S variant has only been reported in a few published
cases (21, 22). In one case, I560S was present in a compound
heterozygous state with  2A, and resulted in markedly reduced
DPD activity and severe toxicity to 5-FU (22). Enzyme function
was also severely reduced in a family member carrying I560S but
not  2A. Morel and colleagues (21) detected I560S in a single

1966

patient who had experienced grade 3 to 4 toxicity following
chemotherapy containing 5-FU. Taken together with these
previous reports, our data suggest that dose reduction, or
avoiding the use of 5-FU in favor of other treatment options,
may be warranted for carriers of either  2A or I560S.
It has long been recognized that genetics have a major role in
the variability of drug metabolism and hence contribute greatly
to the drugs efﬁcacy and toxicity. Personalized medicine
initiatives strive to tailor individual treatment regimens based
on a number of factors, including genetic factors. The results
presented in this article support 5-FU dose reduction in
patients that carry either the  2A or I560S variants to minimize
risk of severe adverse toxicity. Our ﬁndings do not suggest that
C29R, S534N, I543V, or V732I contribute to DPD deﬁciency
individually. In addition, the in vivo cellular model presented
in this article could be used to rapidly identify functional alleles
of interest in a given pathway and use that information to
better individualize therapies. Additional studies currently
underway suggest that this model can be expanded to evaluate
multiple variations within a gene present in both cis and trans
combinations.
