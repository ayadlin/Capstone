ABSTRACT:
Signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and its
downstream effectors, Akt and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), is aberrantly
activated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, where it contributes to leukemic
cell proliferation, survival, and drug-resistance. Thus, inhibiting mTOR signaling in
AML blasts could enhance their sensitivity to cytotoxic agents. Preclinical data also
suggest that allosteric mTOR inhibition with rapamycin impaired leukemia initiating
cells (LICs) function. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic potential of a
combination consisting of temsirolimus [an allosteric mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
inhibitor] with clofarabine, a nucleoside analogue with potent inhibitory effects on
both ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase. The drug combination (CLOTOR) displayed synergistic cytotoxic effects against a panel of AML cell lines and
primary cells from AML patients. Treatment with CLO-TOR induced a G0/G1-phase cell
cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. CLO-TOR was pro-apoptotic in an AML patient
blast subset (CD34+/CD38-/CD123+), which is enriched in putative leukemia initiating
cells (LICs). In summary, the CLO-TOR combination could represent a novel valuable
treatment for AML patients, also in light of its efficacy against LICs.

INTRODUCTION

Despite advances in the treatment, the cure of patients
with AML remains challenging and difficult [2]. In
fact, although intensive chemotherapy induces disease
remission in a large number of patients, many of them
eventually relapse and die. In particular, the outcome of
patients aged ≥60 years remains highly disappointing
[3]. Elderly patients respond less satisfactory to standard
chemotherapy than younger individuals, as reflected by

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is defined as
a clonal disorder characterized by the uncontrolled
proliferation and survival of immature myeloid progenitors
that undergo a differentiation block at various maturation
steps, leading to accumulation of leukemic cells in bone
marrow and inhibition of normal hematopoiesis [1].

RESULTS

higher incidence of treatment-related mortality, lower
complete remission rates, and shorter survival in major
clinical trials [4, 5]. Overall, AML prognosis remains
dismal and new therapeutic approaches are therefore under
active investigation [6]. In AML, aberrant activation of
several signal transduction pathways enhances survival,
proliferation, and drug-resistance of leukemic cells.
Therefore, these signaling cascades are attractive targets
for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies
for AML patients [7]. One promising target for molecular
therapy in AML is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling pathway, which is constitutively activated in 7090% of AML patients and has been shown to be central to
the proliferation, survival, and drug-resistance of leukemic
cells [8, 9]. A major problem in the efforts to treat AML
is the inability of current therapies to efficiently target and
eliminate leukemia initiating cells (LICs), which are the
cells that are thought to initiate and maintain the leukemic
phenotype [10]. The majority of LICs are quiescent and
therefore not sensitive to various chemotherapeutic agents
that kill rapidly dividing cells [11]. This fact could explain
the difficulties in eradicating AML with chemotherapy
alone and the relapses seen in the majority of patients,
despite initial complete responses with drugs regimens
[12]. However, mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, have
displayed cytotoxic activity against LICs in pre-clinical
models of AML [13].
In a recent multicenter, open-label phase II trial
(AML1107) performed by the GIMEMA cooperative
group, it has been studied the efficacy and safety of the
drug combination consisting of low-dosage clofarabine
with the allosteric mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor
temsirolimus (CCI-779, Torisel©) in a group of elderly
patients with refractory/relapsed AML [14]. The results
from this study documented that temsirolimus could be
safely combined with low-dosage clofarabine and that
the combination displayed some encouraging clinical
activity [14]. Clofarabine is a a second-generation
purine nucleoside analogue which has been synthesized
to overcome the limitations and incorporate the best
properties of fludarabine and cladribine. Clofarabine
mainly acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and
DNA polymerase, thereby depleting the amount of
intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for
DNA replication [15]. However, clofarabine displayed
cytotoxic activity also against non-proliferating leukemia
cells, by directly targeting the mitochondria and inducing
apoptosis [16].
In the present study, we have investigated the in
vitro effects of the clofarabine-temsirolimus (henceforth
CLO-TOR) combination on a panel of AML cell lines
and primary cells from AML patients. Our results
could contribute to design in the future more effective
therapeutic protocols based on these two drugs.

The CLO-TOR combination has synergistic
cytotoxic effects in AML cells
The effects of clofarabine, temsirolimus, and
their combination (CLO-TOR) on AML cell lines
were analyzed by first treating the cells with increasing
concentrations of the drugs and then measuring the rates
of survival by MTT assays. Cell lines (U937, HL-60,
OCI-AML3, THP-1, and MOLM-13) were cultured in
the presence of clofarabine or temsirolimus either alone
or in combination at a fixed ratio (1:1) for 24 h (Fig. 1A).
The combined treatment was highly effective in inducing
cytotoxicity in all of the cell lines. The combination
index (CI) values, calculated with Calcusyn software for
dose-effect analysis, indicated the existence of a strong
synergism between clofarabine and temsirolimus (CI<0.3),
especially at lower and intermediate drug concentrations.
The effects of the drugs on proliferation of THP-1 and
MOLM-13 cell lines were analyzed also by cell counting.
Exponentially growing cells were seeded and incubated
with clofarabine (100 nM), temsirolimus (100 nM), and
CLO-TOR (both drugs at 100 nM) for 24 h, then viable
cells were counted. Analysis of the results demonstrated
that CLO-TOR was more efficacious than either treatment
alone in blocking cell proliferation (Fig.1B). To better
assess the effectiveness of CLO-TOR as a potential
therapeutic combination in AML, we examined the
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in 12 AML
patient samples isolated from bone marrow or peripheral
blood. Pathway activation was studied by flow cytometry,
after staining the samples with a phycoerythrin (PE)conjugated anti-CD33 and a PC7-conjugated anti-CD45
antibody, followed by intracellular staining for either Ser
473 p-Akt or Ser 235/236 p-S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP).
Therefore, blast cells could be positively identified by
CD33/CD45/side scatter gating (Fig.1C). All of the
analyzed samples displayed activation of the signaling
pathway, as documented by phosphorylation of both Akt
and S6RP (Fig.1 C).
AML primary cells were then treated with the drugs,
and cell viability was analyzed by MTT assays. A marked
reduction in cell viability at 96 h was detected (Fig.1D).
In Fig.1D it is shown a patient who was very sensible to
CLO-TOR and a patient more resistant to the treatment,
but in whom nevertheless the CLO-TOR combination
displayed a strong synergism, with CIs < 0.4. Of the 12
analyzed patients, 8 were sensitive whereas 4 displayed
various degree of resistance to the drug combination.
Overall, these findings demonstrated that the CLO-TOR
combination has a synergistic cytotoxic activity also
against primary cells from AML patients with up-regulated
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.

The CLO-TOR combination has pro-apoptotic
effects on AML cell lines and block cells in the G0/
G1 phase of the cell cycle

U937 AML cells treated for 24 h with clofarabine or
temsirolimus either alone or in combination documented
a marked increase in G0/G1 phase cells with a decrease in S
and G2/M phase cells. Again, the combined treatment was
more effective than either treatment alone (Fig. 2C). Cell
cycle arrest in G0/G1 was accompanied by an increase in
the expression of p27Kip1, a negative regulator of cell cycle
progression whose levels are under the control of mTOR
signaling [17]. However, the CLO-TOR combination was
more effective than temsirolimus alone in inducing p27Kip1
expression and this was consistent with the effects on cell
cycle progression.

It was then investigated whether cell viability
impairment could be related to apoptosis, using Annexin
V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI)
staining in AML cell lines. After 8 h of treatment, flow
cytometric analysis documented that CLO-TOR was more
effective than either treatment alone in inducing apoptosis
(Fig. 2A). Western blotting analysis of protein extracts
from AML cell lines treated with CLO-TOR documented
the cleavage of procaspase-8, -9 and -3 (Fig. 2B).
Given the fundamental role played by PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling in the control of cell proliferation, the
effects of CLO-TOR on cell cycle progression were also
investigated. Flow cytometric analysis of PI-stained

The CLO-TOR combination induces autophagy
As mTORC1 is an inhibitor of autophagy, it was
investigated whether the CLO-TOR combination could

induce autophagy in AML cells. Induction of autophagy
was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis, which documented the presence of
autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm of MOLM-13
cells (Fig. 3A). However, TEM analysis after CLO-TOR
treatment also revealed the presence of apoptotic cells
and, intriguingly, we found both apoptotic and autophagic
features in the same cells (Fig.3A). To confirm induction
of autophagy, we studied the expression levels of both
beclin-1 and LC3B I/II, two recognized autophagy markers
[18]. Western blot analysis demonstrated an increase in
the expression of both beclin-1 and of the fast migrating
form of LC3B (LC3B II, 14 kDa), while LCB I (16 kDa)
decreased (Fig. 3B). It is worth remembering here that
LC3B-II is bound to the membrane of autophagosome
[19].

We studied the effects of increasing concentrations
of the drugs administered alone or in combination for
24 h on components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway. Western blotting analysis documented that
dephosphorylation of various key components of the
signaling network (Akt, S6RP, 4E-BP1) was mainly
due to the effect of either temsirolimus or CLO-TOR
combination, while clofarabine alone was not able to
induce a significant modulation of this signaling cascade
(Fig.4A). Overall, CLO-TOR was more powerful than
temsirolimus alone in inducing protein dephosphorylation.

The CLO-TOR combination modulates STAT3
and c-Myc in AML cells

The decrease in the levels of Ser 473 p-Akt was consistent
with the capacity of CLO-TOR combination to inhibit
also mTORC2, which is involved in Ser 473 p-Akt
phosphorylation [20].
Considering the relevance of ERK signaling in AML
cells [21, 22], it was analyzed the phosphorylation levels
of ERK 1/2 in MOLM-13 cells treated with the drugs.
Western blotting analysis documented that clofarabine
slightly decreased p-ERK 1/2 levels, whereas temsirolimus
dramatically increased them. However, the CLO-TOR
combination completely prevented the increase in p-ERK
1/2 induced by temsirolimus (Fig. 4B).

It is well known that up-regulated STAT3 activity
is associated with several human tumors, including
AML [23] and that STAT3 inhibition can mediate tumor
regression [24]. Recently, it has been documented that
mTORC2 controls phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser 727
[25]. Therefore, we analyzed Ser 727 p-STAT3 levels
in MOLM-13 cells treated with the drugs. Western blot
analysis demonstrated that STAT3 was dephosphorylated
at Ser 727 maximally after treatment with CLO-TOR for
48 h (Fig. 5A). However, we also observed a reduction in

the amount of total STAT3. Quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis documented that this reduction was
likely due to decreased expression of the STAT3 gene, that
was detected in all AML cell lines already after 24 h of
treatment with CLO-TOR (Fig. 5B). Similar results were
detected in AML primary cells (data not shown).
Phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser 727 is necessary,
in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, for full activation
of STAT3-dependent transcription [26]. Known STAT3 upregulated genes include Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, survivin, Akt, and
c-Myc [27]. Therefore, we analyzed the levels of c-Myc
by both qRT-PCR and western blotting that documented a
marked decrease in the expression of c-Myc mRNA and
protein in all AML cell lines we studied (Fig. 5C-D).

We analyzed the effect of CLO-TOR on mTORC1
signaling and p-ERK 1/2 in 12 AML patient samples.
Three representative patients are presented in Fig. 6A.
Overall, the CLO-TOR combination was more powerful
than either drug alone in dephosphorylating both p70S6
kinase (p70S6K) and 4E-BP1. However, in contrast to the
results obtained using MOLM-13 cells, the drugs did not
result in either increased or decreased phosphorylation of
ERK 1/2 in AML primary cells.

eIF4F complex formation is down-regulated by
CLO-TOR treatment in AML patient samples

incomplete dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 [30, 31]. We
thus performed 7-methyl-GTP pull-down assays in patient
samples treated with CLO-TOR to study the interactions
between eIF4E and eIF4G (active translation) or 4E-BP1
(inactive translation). CLO-TOR decreased the amount
of eIF4G associated with eIF4E, whereas the amount of
4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E increased, thus switching
translation to an inactive state (Fig. 6B). Western blots
analysis performed on whole-cell lysates documented that
the drug combination did not significantly reduce eIF4G,
eIF4E, or 4E-BP1 expression.

Translation of mRNA is tightly regulated at the
initiation level through the assembly of eIF4F complexes.
The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is the limiting step in
the assembly of the translation initiating complex eIF4F,
initiated by the interactions between the eIF4E and eIF4G
proteins [28, 29]. It has been documented that rapamycin
and rapalogs were not effective at blocking the formation
of the eIF4F complex in acute leukemia cells, owing to

The CLO-TOR combination targets the CD34+/
CD38-/CD123+ AML cell subset

p70S6K, S6RP, and 4E-BP1 in the cell lines and patient
samples analyzed. Down-regulation of Ser 473 p-Akt
levels demonstrated that the drug combination was able
to inhibit also mTORC2 activity. This observation is
noteworthy, as previous studies have highlighted that
a major limitation of rapamycin and its analogs is that
they could actually up-regulate p-Akt levels in AML
cells [38]. The ability of CLO-TOR to down-modulate
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is also important, as Tamburini
et al. [30] emphasized that the weak anti-leukemic activity
of the rapalogs was mainly due to the sustained high level
of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in AML cells treated with these
compounds. Conversely, we showed herein that the CLOTOR combination blocked 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Thr
37/46  in AML patient samples. Indeed, phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1 is the limiting step for the assembly of the
translation-initiating complexes. As a consequence of 4EBP1 dephosphorylation, CLO-TOR inhibited the assembly
of eIF4F-initiating complexes, as we have demonstrated.
This could result in a global inhibition of protein synthesis
and thus a decreased expression of oncogenic proteins
regulated at the translation initiation level [39].
Another limitation of rapalogs is that mTORC1
inhibition led to the activation of ERK 1/2 in a variety
of cancer cell lines and primary tumor cells, as well as
in a cohort of patients with metastatic disease who had
undergone therapy with RAD-001 [40]. Mechanistically,
it has been demonstrated that ERK 1/2 activation could
be mediated by a p70S6K-PI3K-Ras signaling pathway
[40]. However, the impact of rapalogs on ERK 1/2
phosphorylation levels has never been studied in AML
cells. Temsirolimus dramatically increased ERK 1/2
phosphorylation in MOLM-13 cells and, intriguingly,
this increase was completely blocked by co-treatment
with clofarabine. Nevertheless, we have not detected any
changes in p-ERK 1/2 levels in AML primary cells treated
with temsirolimus. Therefore, the effects of rapalogs
on ERK 1/2 signaling in AML cells is an issue that will
require further investigation, using a panel of AML cell
lines and a larger number of patient samples.
Another interesting observation emerging from our
study is that CLO-TOR treatment affected the transcription
of the STAT3 gene in AML cell lines and patient samples.
It has been documented that STAT3 gene expression is
regulated by mTOR signaling in cancer cells [41, 42],
however, it is not clear why the addition of clofarabine
to temsirolimus resulted in further down-regulation of
STAT3 gene.
Consistently with the down-regulation of STAT3
expression and phosphorylation, CLO-TOR caused a
decreased expression of c-Myc gene and protein levels.
c-Myc expression down-regulation may be very important
for explaining the cytotoxic effects of CLO-TOR, as a
decrease in c-Myc levels could result in the inhibition of
ribosome synthesis that in turn causes proliferative arrest
or have irreversible consequences, including apoptosis

Relapses from AML are thought to originate from
the outgrowth of a leukemic subpopulation (CD34+/CD38-/
CD123+) displaying both self-renewal and drug-resistance,
referred to as LICs. Therefore, it was investigated whether
CLO-TOR could induce apoptosis this AML patient cell
subset. After electronic gating on the CD34+/CD38-/
CD123+ subpopulation, cells were analyzed for positivity
to Annexin V staining. After 24 h of treatment, the CLOTOR combination was significantly more effective in
inducing apoptosis than the single drugs (Fig. 7A). The
CLO-TOR combination was also able to induce a marked
dephosphorylation of both Ser 473 p-Akt (Fig. 7B) and Ser
235/236 p-S6RP (Fig. 7C) in the CD34+/CD38-/CD123+
cell subset, implying a down-modulation of mTORC1/2
signaling activity in LICs.

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapy is at present the treatment of choice
for treating AML patients [32]. However, great interest
surrounds the development of novel, lees toxic, targeted
therapies, especially for elderly patients [33, 34]. Here,
we have evaluated the in vitro effects of the CLO-TOR
combination on AML cell lines and patient samples.
CLO-TOR reduced cell viability in a panel of AML cell
lines and primary cells from AML patients. The combined
treatment increased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1
phase of the cell cycle. Inhibition of cell proliferation
correlated with up-regulation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1.
It is known that mTOR controls the expression of the
p27Kip1 gene through the Oct 1 transcription factor [35].
Nevertheless, we do not know why clofarabine, when
administered with temsirolimus, potentiated the induction
of p27Kip1 expression.
Moreover, the CLO-TOR combination induced
apoptosis, as documented by cleavage of caspase-3, -8,
and .9. These findings indicated that both the intrinsic
and extrinsic pathway of apoptosis were activated upon
incubation with the drugs. However, we observed that
also autophagy was activated in response to CLOTOR. It should be reminded here that mTORC1 inhibits
autophagy [36]. Interestingly, while clofarabine alone
predominantly induced apoptosis (data not shown),
the CLO-TOR treatment induced both apoptosis and
autophagy in the same cell. Since autophagy could be
a protective mechanism against the cytotoxic effects of
chemotherapeutic drugs [37], it will be interesting in the
future to assess if inhibition of autophagy could increase
the cytotoxicity of the CLO-TOR combination.
CLO-TOR was capable of inhibiting the
phosphorylation of Akt on Ser 473 as well as
phosphorylation of the mTORC1 downstream targets,

20% FBS.

We have also documented that CLO-TOR treatment
caused apoptosis in the CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ cell subset
that is enriched in LICs. Importantly, the combined
treatment was more effective than either drug alone
in inducing apoptotic cell death in this subpopulation.
Moreover, CLO-TOR was able to down-regulate the
phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 and of S6RP at Ser
235/236, implying targeting of both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 in the CD34+/CD38-/CD 123+ subset.
Although clofarabine is used for the treatment
of acute leukemias both in the adults and children [44,
45], surprisingly there are very few data in the literature
regarding the effects of this drug on signaling pathways
that are up-regulated in leukemic cells. It has been
documented that clofarabine induced dephosphorylation
of Akt and some of its down-stream targets (Bad
and FOXO3A) in CCRF-CEM acute lymphoblastic
leukemia cells [46]. Moreover, clofarabine decreased the
expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, including Mcl-1
and Bcl-XL. Here, we have demonstrated that clofarabine
potentiated the effects of temsirolimus on p27Kip1 and
STAT3 expression, as well as on the phoshorylation
levels of Akt, p70S6K, S6RP, and 4E-BP1. It is at present
unclear how clofarabine could influence gene expression
and protein phosphorylation. However, further studies
of these additional effects of clofarabine will be of the
utmost importance, as they could help in designing more
efficacious therapeutic protocols, combining clofarabine
and signal trasduction modulators, for the treatment of
acute leukemia patients.

Cell viability analysis
MTT
(3-[4,5-Dimethylthythiazol-2-yl]-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assays were performed
to assess the sensitivity of cells to drugs, as previously
described [47, 48].
Combined drug effect analysis
The combination effect and a potential synergy
were evaluated from quantitative analysis of dose-effect
relationships, as described elsewhere [49]. For each
combination experiment, a CI (combination index) number
was calculated using the Biosoft CalcuSyn software. This
method of analysis generally defines CI values of 0.9
to 1.1 as additive, 0.3 to 0.9 as synergistic, and <0.3 as
strongly synergistic, whereas values >1.1 are considered
antagonistic.
Cell cycle analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a
PI/RNase A staining according to standard procedures, as
described previously [50].
Annexin V-FITC/PI staining
To determine the extent of apoptosis induction,
flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI-stained
samples was performed [20]. Samples were analyzed on
an FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) with the
appropriate software (CXP, Beckman Coulter).
Flow cytometric detection of AML blasts and LICs
Bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients
were separated by Ficoll/Hypaque density centrifugation
and stained with a PE-conjugated anti-CD33 and a
PC7-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody. They were then
washed with phosphate-buffered saline and processed
for intracytoplasmic staining of either p-Akt or p-S6RP,
using AlexaFluor488®-conjugated antibodies, as reported
elsewhere [14].
For LICs detection, a total of 5×105 primary AML
blast cells were stained with the following conjugated
antibodies: CD34-PC5, CD38-PC7, and CD123-PE.
In some cases cells were further stained with Annexin
V-FITC, while in others they were permeabilized and
stained with AlexaFluor® 488-conjugated antibodies to
either p-Akt or p-S6RP [51].
Analyses were performed on a Navios (Beckman
Coulter) flow cytometer equipped with Kaluza software
(Beckman Coulter). Isotypic controls of the corresponding
fluorochromes were used to define the threshold for
positive-staining cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Clofarabine was provided by Genzyme Europe
(Naarden, The Netherlands), while temsirolimus (CCI779, Torisel®) was from Pfizer Inc. (New York, NY, USA).
For western blotting analysis, primary antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,
USA). All the antibodies for flow cytometry were from
Beckman Coulter (Miami, FL, USA).
Cell culture and primary samples
The AML cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All
cell lines, except U937, were from Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH
(Braunschweig, Germany), and were characterized as
specified (http://www.dsmz.de/human_and_animal_cell_
lines/main.php?contentleft_id=21). Peripheral blood
or bone marrow primary cells from AML patients were
obtained with informed consent according to Institutional
guidelines, isolated using Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare,
Little Chalfont, UK), and cultured in RPMI 1640 with
