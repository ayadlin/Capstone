ABSTRACT
Recent evidence indicates that protein kinase CK1α may support the growth
of multiple myeloma (MM) plasma cells. Here, by analyzing a large cohort of MM
cases, we found that high CK1α mRNA levels are virtually associated with all MM
patients. Moreover, we provided functional evidence that CK1α activity is essential for
malignant plasma cell survival even in the protective niche generated by co-cultures
with bone marrow stromal cells. We demonstrated that CK1α inactivation, while toxic
for myeloma cells, is dispensable for the survival of healthy B lymphocytes and stromal
cells. Disruption of CK1α function in myeloma cells resulted in decreased Mdm2,
increased p53 and p21 and reduced expression of β-catenin and AKT. These effects
were mediated partially by p53 and caspase activity. Finally, we discovered that
CK1α inactivation enhanced the cytotoxic effect of both bortezomib and lenalidomide.
Overall, our study supports a role for CK1α as a potential therapeutic target in MM in
combination with proteasome inhibitors and/or immunomodulatory drugs.

INTRODUCTION

lines (HMCLs) express Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6
co-receptors, as well as high levels of phosphorylated
AKT on Ser473, which depends on mTOR activity [3].
Both β-catenin and AKT act as oncogenes and display
an increased activity in a wide variety of malignant
tumors, including MM [4, 5]. Moreover, BM stromal cells
(BMSC) release Wnt or other growth factors which can
potentially contribute to MM cell drug resistance [4, 6],
triggering β-catenin and the PI3K/AKT signalling [7].
Protein kinase CK1 is a highly conserved family
of monomeric serine/threonine kinases composed by
seven members (α, β, γ1, γ2, γ3, δ, ε) which display
the highest homology in their kinase domain (50–90%
identical) with overlapping substrate specificity. CK1

Multiple myeloma (MM), the second most frequent
hematologic neoplasia accounting for about 10–15% of
all blood tumors [1], is characterized by the progressive
growth of malignant clonal plasma cells (PCs) in
the bone marrow (BM) where they find a favourable
microenvironmental niche. Often myeloma cells develop
resistance to therapy, likely due to a continuous selection
of more biologically aggressive subclones [2].
Among the several signalling pathways regulating
MM cell growth, the Wnt/β-catenin and the PI3K/
AKT cascades are of particular importance for MM
expansion. PCs from MM patients and human MM cell

members regulate membrane biology, molecule transport,
signal transduction, transcription, translation and DNAdamage response [8–10]. CK1α, which is encoded
by the CSNK1A1 gene, mapping on chromosome 5 at
5q32, regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.
CK1α phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser45, priming it
for the subsequent protein kinase GSK3-dependent
phosphorylation at Ser33/37/Thr41, which tags the protein
for proteasome-mediated degradation [11]. However,
CK1α may also phosphorylate LRP6, triggering Wntmediated intracellular signalling [12].
CK1α is also a regulator of the AKT pathway. It has
been reported that in human embryonic kidney cells CK1α
phosphorylates DEPTOR (an mTOR inhibitor), which is
then targeted to the proteasome, thus activating mTORmediated survival pathways [13, 14]. Since mTOR in turn
regulates AKT activation [15], CK1α could indirectly
modulate AKT function.
CK1α also phosphorylates the tumor suppressor
p53 [16] and stimulates the binding of murine double
minute chromosome 2 (Mdm2) to p53, therefore
inhibiting p53 function [17, 18]. In mouse models, CK1α
loss of function in intestinal epithelial cells caused a
strong activation of the Wnt pathway, however it did not
lead to tumor formation as long as p53 function remained
intact [19, 20]. On the opposite, in a murine acute
leukemia (AML) model, CK1α loss of function resulted
in a dramatic disadvantage for the leukemic clone growth,
provided the presence of an intact p53 function [21].
Furthermore, the role of CK1α in mediating tumor cell
survival is supported by the finding that treatment with
the immunomodulatory drug (iMID) lenalidomide (Lena)
induced the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1CRBN (CRL4CRBN)-mediated ubiquitination of CK1α in
del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), in which one
CSNK1A1 allele is lost, with degradation of the residual
CK1α protein [22].
To inhibit CK1α activity, specific small ATPcompetitive molecules have been developed. D4476
(4-[4-(2,3-Dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-5-(2-pyridinyl)1H-imidazol-2-yl]benzamide) is a cell-permeant inhibitor
specific for CK1. It has been demonstrated that D4476
does not inhibit other important kinases (like ERK2, JNK,
MSK1, PDK1 and PKA) and it is the best CK1 inhibitor
commercially available [23].
More recently, it has been demonstrated that CK1α
also sustains MM cell survival [24]. Here, we investigated
CSNK1A1 mRNA expression in a large microarray dataset
of MM cases and analyzed CK1α role in MM cell growth,
also in BM microenvironment models. We found that
CK1α inhibition/silencing causes cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis of MM cells in a p53-Mdm2 dependent manner,
overcoming BMSC-dependent protection. Mechanistically,
CK1α inhibition caused downregulation of the β-catenin
and AKT survival pathways and empowered the cytotoxic
and cytostatic effect of bortezomib (BZ) and Lena.

CK1α expression and cellular localization is
different between MM cells and normal cells
In most available gene expression profiling (GEP)
datasets we found that CSNK1A1 mRNA is significantly
overexpressed throughout the progression from normal
to highly malignant PCs (Oncomine™) [25–27]. Also,
CSNK1A1 mRNA was found overexpressed in XBP1sexpressing transformed PCs from transgenic mice [28].
To further validate these data, we investigated GEP data
of BM plasma cells obtained from 4 healthy controls,
129 MM, 36 plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients,
and 18 MM cell lines. More than 90% of malignant
plasma cells cases overexpressed CSNK1A1 mRNA
compared to controls (Figure 1A). We next performed
a correlation between CSNK1A1 mRNA expression
and the different molecular groups included in the TC
classification: TC1, characterized by the t(11;14) or
t(6;14) with high expression of CCND1 or CCND3;
TC2, characterized by absence of IGH translocation,
low levels of CCND1 and hyperdiploid status; TC3,
characterized by absence of IGH translocation and
CCND2 expression; TC4, showing high level of
CCND2 and the presence of t(4;14); TC5, expressing
the highest level of CCND2 in association with
MAF translocations [29, 30]. CSNK1A1 mRNA was
significantly higher in TC2 samples compared to the
other TC groups (Figure 1B). We have also evaluated
the absolute transcript levels of CSNK1A1 in 17
symptomatic MM and 2 primary PCL patients, included
in GSE66293 proprietary dataset [31], investigated at
diagnosis and first relapse. No significant difference
in CSNK1A1 mRNA expression was observed
between these two conditions (Figure 1C). To further
corroborate the mRNA data, we next performed a
survey of CK1α protein expression in purified CD138+
malignant PCs from MM patients and HMCLs showing
high CK1α protein levels expression in all the samples
analyzed (Figure 1D; Table 1A summarizes the clinical
features of the MM patients investigated in this set of
experiments). Densitometric analysis of CK1α protein
expression confirmed that there is no difference between
newly diagnosed and relapsed patients (Figure 1E).
Previous studies reported that CK1α is detected
in all cellular compartments and that its subcellular
distribution is cell-cycle dependent [32]. We found
that CK1α localized mainly in the cytoplasm of
healthy B lymphocytes, while it was present both in the
cytoplasm and in the nucleus of malignant PCs from
MM and PCL patients and in all the HMCLs tested
(Supplementary Figure 1). This different localization
of CK1α was present also in a MM cell line, called
SaMMi, which was generated in our laboratory from a
primary tumor (see Table 2 for details).

concentration of 10 µM for INA-6 (the most sensitive
MM cell line) reaching 40 µM for H929 and U-266 (the
least sensitive). SaMMi cells were also very responsive
to D4476-induced apoptosis at a concentration as low
as 5 µM. D4476 induced MM cell apoptosis both in
IL-6/stroma dependent (INA-6, SaMMi, U-266) and
independent (H929) HMCLs. Treatment with the vehicle
alone (DMSO) did not cause a significant amount of
apoptosis compared to untreated cells (Figure 2A). To test

To confirm that high levels of CK1α kinase in MM
are functionally relevant, we treated MM cells with the
CK1 inhibitor D4476 at different concentrations for as
long as 48 h. Annexin V/PI staining and FACS analysis
showed that MM cells exposed to D4476 underwent
a remarkable amount of apoptosis starting from the

the effects of D4476 in control cells, we treated PBMCs
from healthy donors with D4476 at different doses for 48 h
and analyzed apoptosis in the CD19+ fraction by flow
cytometry. The CK1 inhibitor did not cause any significant
changes in apoptosis of CD19+ healthy B lymphocytes at
any concentration used compared to DMSO treated cells,
indicating no toxicity for normal B cells (Figure 2B).
Also D4476 treated CD138+ PCs isolated from seven
MM patients underwent, on average, a significant amount
of apoptosis compared to untreated cells (Figure 2C).
When CK1 inhibition was tested also in a model of
protective microenvironment [33] we observed that
BMSCs were not able to protect INA-6 or SaMMi MM
cells from D4476-induced cell death (Figure 2D– 2E).
To note, HS-5 stromal cells protected SaMMi from
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 2)
showing that also this new cell line is suitable for the BM
microenvironment model experiments. CK1 blockade had
cytotoxic consequences mainly on malignant PCs, since
HS-5 cells were spared by D4476-induced cytotoxicity
(data not shown). Most importantly, the apoptotic effect of
D4476 was also found in patient-derived PCs co-cultured
with HS-5 or patient-derived BMSCs (Figure 2F–2G; see
Table 1B for clinical features of patients). To note, even
though we observed higher protection by patient-derived
BMSCs compared to the HS-5 stromal cell line, D4476
was still able to induce MM cell apoptosis. These results
suggest a pro-survival role of CK1 for MM cells also in
the BM microenvironment context.

see methods) determined a boost of apoptosis in INA-6
cells grown alone (Figure 3A–3B), or in the presence of
protective stromal HS-5 (Figure 3C). To check the effects
of CK1α knockdown also in the BM microenvironment
context, we pre-treated INA-6 clones with IPTG for 6
days to induce the silencing of CK1α. Afterwards, control
and silenced cells where co-cultured with HS-5 for
additional 4 days (in the presence or absence of IPTG).
CK1α knockdown determined an increase of apoptosis
also in the context of the microenvironment, as shown by
the increase in the amount of Annexin V positive cells,
a raise of PARP cleavage and decrease of Mcl1 protein
expression level (Figure 3C), therefore overcoming
stromal cells protection. The apoptotic effect of CK1α
silencing was observed also in H929 cells (Figure 3D–3E).
In all samples, immunoblot analysis confirmed that
CK1α was efficiently knocked down. Of note, IPTG
treatment did not change CK1α expression levels and
the apoptotic rate in wt INA-6 or H929 cells compared
to untreated cells, confirming the efficacy/specificity of
the silencing strategy (Figure 3B–3E). The pro-apoptotic
effect of CK1α knockdown was further confirmed by cell
cycle analysis. CK1α silencing determined an increase
in the sub-G1 (apoptotic) phase and a reduction in G0/
G1 phase of the cell cycle (Supplementary Figure 4A),
accompanied by a reduction of Mdm2 and an increase of
p21, (Supplementary Figure 4B) confirming the activation
of a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest.

Inhibition of CK1α leads to a caspase-dependent
β-catenin and AKT degradation

CK1 blockade associates with activation of a
p53-dependent apoptotic cascade

Since β-catenin and AKT signalling pathways
are crucial for MM pathobiology, and given the role of
CK1α in modulating their activity in other cell types,
we sought to investigate the role of CK1α on β-catenin
and AKT transduction cascades in MM. H929, INA-6
and MM patient-derived plasma cells (grown alone or in
co-culture with HS-5 or MM BMSCs) were treated with
the indicated concentrations of D4476 and WB analysis
was carried on. After CK1 inhibition, a reduction of
phosphorylated β-catenin on Ser45 and on Ser33/37/Thr41
and of phosphorylated AKT on Ser473 was observed in all
the tested cells (Figure 4A–4C). However, unexpectedly,
a reduction of total β-catenin and AKT protein levels was
also observed, which could account for the lowering of
the phosphorylated forms. RNAi of CK1α in two MM
cell lines led to similar effects (Figure 4D–4E). To test
if the observed reduction of β-catenin and AKT induced
by CK1α inactivation was proteasome dependent, we
treated H929 and INA-6 cells grown alone or in co-culture
with HS-5 with D4476 for 48 h and with the proteasome
inhibitor BZ for 18 h. D4476 prevented BZ-induced
accumulation of β-catenin and AKT, indicating that the
observed D4476-induced β-catenin and AKT decrease was
not mediated by the proteasome (Figure 5A).

D4476-induced apoptosis was accompanied by
increased expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins
(Bax, Bak, cleaved PARP) and decreased expression
of the pro-survival molecule Mcl1 (Supplementary
Figure 3A). It was previously shown that CK1α promotes
p53 degradation in different cell types [16, 17]. Indeed,
also in INA-6, U-266, and SaMMi MM cells, D4476
caused an increase of p53 protein levels with a consequent
upregulation of its target p21 and a reduction of Mdm2
protein (Supplementary Figure 3B). Altogether, these
findings support the view that D4476-induced apoptosis
could be mediated by the activation of a p53-dependent
response.

CK1α silencing causes apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest
To validate the results obtained with the chemical
inhibition of CK1α, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to
knockdown CK1α protein in INA-6 and H929 cells. As
shown in Figure 3, CK1α knockdown (obtained both with
electroporation of double strand (ds) siRNA or through the
generation of IPTG inducible CSNK1A1 specific shRNAs–

Another AKT or β-catenin degradation mechanism
could involve caspases and the tumor suppressor p53 [34, 35].
Previous studies in other cell types, showed a reduction of
β-catenin upon increasing expression and activity of p53
[35]. Moreover, other works described a caspase-dependent
(mainly caspase 3, 6 and 8) and apoptosis-induced cleavage
of β-catenin [36, 37]. Therefore, to test if this mechanism
could be responsible of β-catenin and AKT degradation upon
CK1α inhibition also in MM cells, we treated INA-6 cells
with D4476 and the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK.
The addition of Z-VAD-FMK, prevented the D4476-induced
reduction of β-catenin and AKT. The efficacy of the caspase
inhibitor was confirmed by Annexin V/PI staining, Pro-caspase
3 and Mcl1 protein detection by WB (Figure 5B). Next, we
checked if other p53-inducing agents could correlate with
a reduction in β-catenin expression in MM. Remarkably,
doxorubicin determined an upregulation of the p53 axis (p53
and p21 increase, reduction of Mdm2 protein level) with
concomitant decrease in total β-catenin level in INA-6 and
H929 (Figure 5C). Taken together, these results suggest that p53
and caspase-mediated apoptosis could be responsible for the
D4476-induced reduction of β-catenin and AKT in MM cells.

[38]), with D4476. CK1 inactivation caused a strong
dose dependent cytotoxicity in UTMC2 cells without
an additive role with BZ. Moreover D4476 cooperated
with BZ in inducing cell death also in the model of
BM microenvironment of INA-6 grown in co-cultures
with HS-5 or patient-derived BMSCs (Supplementary
Figure 5F–5G). Importantly, CK1 inhibition was able
to overcome patient BMSCs-induced resistance to
BZ (Supplementary Figure 5G). To determine if the
inhibition of CK1 and the proteasome could cause either
an additive or a synergic effect in terms of cell growth
arrest, we performed MTT assay evaluating cell viability
after treating H929 cells with increasing concentration
of BZ and D4476 and with the combination of the two
compounds. The results showed that treatment of MM
cells with BZ and the CK1 inhibitor was strongly synergic
(Supplementary Figure 5H), as judged by the calculated
Combination Index (CI) well below 1 (0.560). Moreover,
we evaluated CK1α expression in MM patients with
regards to BZ sensitivity, by analyzing CSNK1A1 mRNA
expression in the public dataset GSE9782 [39]. Patients
included in this study were treated with BZ and the dataset
consisted of 169 patients evaluable for response. A slight
significant difference was evidenced between 85 responder
and 84 not responder MM patients, showing higher
expression levels of CSNK1A1 in not responder patients
(Supplementary Figure 5I).

CK1 inhibition boosts bortezomib induced
cytotoxicity
Since CK1α promotes MM cell survival, we
sought to investigate if its inhibition could empower the
cytotoxicity exerted by bortezomib. To this aim, we first
assessed the extent of apoptosis of MM cells exposed in
culture to D4476 and BZ. D4476 caused an increase of
BZ-induced apoptosis in the BZ sensitive U-266, H929
and INA-6 MM cells (Supplementary Figure 5A–5C).
To evaluate the role of CK1α in BZ resistance, we also
treated RPMI-8226 (a less BZ sensitive cell line) with
subtoxic doses of BZ (5 nM and 7.5 nM) in association
with D4476. In this cell line, higher doses of BZ
(10 nM) are needed to obtained BZ-induced cytotoxicity
(Supplementary Figure 5D). CK1 inhibition in association
with BZ was able to cause a moderately higher level of
apoptosis compared to the single treatments and overcome
BZ resistance in these cells. Furthermore, we have treated
the UTMC2 cell line (which is reported to be BZ resistant

CK1α is degraded by lenalidomide and its
inhibition/silencing reinforces lenalidomide
cytotoxicity
To investigate if CK1α inhibition could modify
iMIDs induced cytotoxicity, we first treated H929
MM cells with different concentrations of Lena for
4 and 7 days and we confirmed a pro-apoptotic and an
antiproliferative/cytostatic effect of Lena in MM cells
(Supplementary Figure 6). We next established that
Lena causes a dose- and time-dependent degradation of
CK1α protein in H929 with a subsequent reduction of its
kinase activity (a decrease phosphorylation of its target
phosphorylated Ser45 β-catenin was shown) (Figure 6A).
A time-dependent Lena-induced degradation of CK1α

was confirmed also in U-266 and INA-6 cell lines at even
earlier time points (4 h treatment) (Figure 6B, 6C).
Next, Lena sensitive (H929, SaMMi) and insensitive
(INA-6) cells were treated with Lena 10 µM for 3 or
7 days. Forty-eight hours before harvesting, D4476 was
added to the cell culture. D4476 strikingly cooperated with
Lena in inducing MM cell death causing an increase of
apoptotic cells compared to single treatments (Figure 7A).
Interestingly, CK1α inhibition overcome Lena resistance
in INA-6 cells. The therapeutic potential of Lena and
D4476 was demonstrated also in models of myeloma BM
microenvironment. Indeed, Lena potentiated the cytotoxic

effect of D4476, overcoming BM protection also in
SaMMi cells grown on HS-5 (Figure 7A, right panel).
To test if the two drugs acts in a synergistic mode,
we performed the MTT viability assay calculating the CI.
H929 cells were treated with increasing doses of Lena or
D4476 and with the combination of the two compounds.
The CI was 0.705 suggesting a synergy between the CK1
inhibitor and Lena in reducing cell viability (Figure 7B).
Next we evaluated the effect of D4476 and Lena
on cell cycle. D4476 plus Lena caused a decrease in
the percentage of cells in G1 and in S/G2M phases and
an increase in the frequency of sub-G1 apoptotic cells,

compared to the single treatments (Figure 7C). Also
Ki-67 staining showed a significant reduction of active
proliferating cells in the combined treatment (Figure 7C).
Moreover, a raise of p21 and a decline of Mdm2 protein
levels were stronger in the combination treatment
compared to the single treatments (Figure 7D).
Next, we treated CK1α-silenced (with siRNA
against CSNK1A1) and control H929 cells with Lena
10 µM for 3 days. The combination of Lena and CK1α
silencing determined a stronger reduction of active
proliferating cells as judged by a marked decline in the
percentage of Ki-67 positive cells as compared to single
treatments. An increase in apoptosis and the derangement
in the cell cycle were also confirmed by a reduction in the

uncleaved PARP, Mdm2 protein and a subsequent increase
in p21. CK1α silencing empowered Lena induced CK1α
protein degradation with subsequent further reduction in
its activity on Ser45 β-catenin. Moreover, the combination
of CK1α silencing and Lena also effectively decrease AKT
phosphorylation and protein level (Figure 8).

DISCUSSION
In the present study we investigated the expression
of CK1α in MM and provided evidence of its role in
sustaining MM cell survival and proliferation. We also
demonstrated that CK1α controls the levels of β-catenin
and AKT, likely preventing their p53/caspase-mediated

silenced for CK1α. CK1α silencing was obtained with electroporation of ds oligonucleotides directed against CK1α (A, D) or using IPTG
inducible CK1α shRNA cellular clones (shRNA#1, shRNA#2, shRNA#3, B,C,E). Cells were treated with IPTG 500 µM (INA-6, and H929
shRNA#1) or 1000 µM (H929 shRNA#3) for 7 days (INA-6 shRNA#1, and H929 shRNA#1 and 2) or 12 days (INA-6 shRNA#2). For the
BM microenvironment model (C) INA-6 wt and shRNA#1 cells were treated with IPTG 500 µM for 6 days and subsequently plated on
HS-5 stromal cells for an additional 4 days in the continuous presence of IPTG. In all experiments, IPTG was added also to wt INA-6 cells
and H929 cells as control. GAPDH or α-tubulin was used as loading control. * indicates p < 0.05. Data represent the mean ± SEM of three

degradation cascade. We confirmed that CK1α is a target
of Lena in MM cells and showed that its inactivation
cooperates with BZ and Lena in inducing MM cell death,
even in the protective niche of the BM microenvironment.
In a recent work, Hu et al. demonstrated that CK1α
sustains MM cell survival [24]. However, no studies have
investigated whether CK1α inactivation, especially in the
MM BM microenvironment, could affect the cytotoxic
effects of novel drugs, such as Lena, in the therapy of this
hematological malignancy.
According to previous studies [24], we confirmed,
in a larger and representative panel, that CSNK1A1
mRNA is overexpressed in MM patients. Interestingly,
we demonstrated for the first time a differential CSNK1A1
mRNA expression between the TC groups. In particular,
higher levels of CSNK1A1 were associated with TC2

patients, who are characterized by the hyperdiploid
status that involves several odd chromosomes including
chromosome 5 where CSNK1A1 is located. Among the 30
TC2 cases investigated, 26 (87%) showed extra copies of
chromosome 5 (data not shown), thus suggesting that a
gene dosage effect could be partially responsible of the
high expression of the CSNK1A1 gene (Figure 1B).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
analyzing CK1α mRNA and protein expression in a large
cohort of MM patients both at diagnosis and relapse. To
note, we did not observe substantial differences between
these two patient groups, suggesting that CK1α levels
could not correlate with the clonal evolution of MM
plasma cells. We also demonstrated an atypical nuclear
diffuse/microspeckled pattern localization in MM
cells, pointing to a myeloma-specific function likely in

regulating gene transcription and/or chromatin DNA
methabolism [13, 32].
The pro-apoptotic effects and alteration of cell
cycle related to CK1α inactivation in MM cells support
its pro-survival function in this malignancy. Both CK1α
inhibition and silencing were able to overcome the BM
microenvironment-dependent protection (Figures 2 and 3).
By contrast, CK1α inhibition did not influence HS-5

stromal cell or healthy B lymphocytes mortality,
suggesting that this effect could be restricted to malignant
MM cells.
Unexpectedly, we found that β-catenin levels decreased
upon CK1α blockade. This was not prevented by proteasome
inhibition, but it was rescued by caspase blockade. Similarly,
CK1α inhibition or silencing was accompanied by AKT
kinase decrease, in line with what expected according to the

CK1α-mediated inhibition of the AKT inhibitor DEPTOR
[14]. Similarly to what demonstrated in lymphoma cells
[34], we provided evidence that, also in myeloma cells
undergoing p53-dependent apoptosis, AKT is downregulated
by a caspase-dependent mechanism.
Moreover, it is known that both AKT [40, 41] and
CK1α [18] can phosphorylate and activate Mdm2 with
the consequent degradation of p53. In addition, AKT
decreases caspase 9 activity by phosphorylation on
Ser196 [42], thus promoting cell survival. A reduction
in AKT protein level could therefore downmodulate
Mdm2 phosphorylation with the subsequent p53 and
caspase activation, in a positive feedback loop. The final
effect would be the arrest of cell cycle and activation
of apoptosis. Since MM cells rely on both β-catenin
and AKT, their downregulation achieved with CK1α
inactivation could be therapeutically relevant. To this
regard, the reduction of BZ-induced AKT and β-catenin
accumulation (a possible drawback of BZ) achieved upon
CK1α inhibition may potentially overcome BZ resistance
(Figure 5). Indeed,
CK1α inhibition synergically
potentiated BZ toxicity in MM (Supplementary Figure 5).
To note CSNK1A1 mRNA expression is higher in BZ
resistant patients, suggesting the possibility that this kinase
might influence the sensitivity to BZ. Importantly, CK1α
inactivation reduced β-catenin and AKT proteins also in
the presence of Lena, and effectively cooperates with this
drug in inducing apoptosis and growth arrest, also in the
BM microenvironment.
Taken together, our data support an oncogenic
role of CK1α in MM, likely by impinging on critical

microenvironment dependent survival pathways
(Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT). Therefore, it would
be worth pursuing to consider the design of novel
selective CK1α inhibitors to be used in the clinical
setting in association with conventional or novel antimyeloma agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and cell cultures
PBMC, MM and HS-5 cell lines, primary BMSCs from
patients were isolated and cultured as previously described
[31, 33, 43]. Malignant CD138+ PCs and healthy B cells were
isolated with EasySep™ kits (STEMCELL Technologies,
USA), after achieving informed consent according to the
declaration of Helsinki. The internal Institutional Board
approved the use of human material. SaMMi cell line was
obtained from a 81 year old woman with a 20% PCs in the
bone marrow. CD138+ SaMMi PCs were cultured in DMEM
20% FBS with the addition of IL-6 2.5 ng/ml. Co-cultures of
HS-5 or BMSCs with INA-6 or patient derived CD138+ PCs
were stabilized as described in [33].The clinical features of
the patients analyzed and the immunophenotype/karyotype
of SaMMi are detailed in Tables 1 and 2.

GEP and data analysis
The study was performed in a cohort of 165 patients,
representative of all the major forms of plasma cell dyscrasia.

controls (Voden, Medical Instruments, Italy), 129 MM, 24
primary PCL (pPCL), 12 secondary PCL (sPCL) patients and 18
HMCLs [31]. With the exception of sPCL, the cohort consists of
newly diagnosed patients. PCs were puriﬁed from BM samples
using CD138 immunomagnetic microbeads (MidiMACS
system, Miltenyi Biotec, CA, USA). Samples were characterized
for the presence of the most frequent chromosomal translocations
and the ploidy status based on fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) evaluation criteria [44]: 48 showed an HD status; 34
were characterized by the t(11;14) or t(6;14) translocations;
19 had the t(4;14) translocation; 6 had either the t(14;16) or
t(14;20) translocations; and 22 did not fall into any of the other
groups. Details regarding the source of all HMCLs have been
previously reported [31, 45, 46] and recently authenticated
by STR profiling and/or gene mutational analyses. For gene
expression analysis, samples were profiled on the GeneChip
Human Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, CA, USA) as described
[47]. The raw intensity expression values were processed by

Robust Multi-array Average procedure (RMA) [48] with the reannotated Chip Definition Files from BrainArray libraries version

shRNA lentiviral transduction
INA-6 and H929 were transduced with the IPTG
inducible lentiviral particles carrying CSNK1A1specific shRNA (pLKO_IPTG_3XLacO, SigmaAldrich, Italy). Three independent shRNAs sequences
were chosen (TRCN0000006044, named shRNA#1,
TRCN0000006287, named shRNA#2, TRCN0000006042,
named shRNA#3). 2 × 104 cells were infected with
a multiplicity of infection of 5, using the spinfection
method (centrifuged at 1000 g for 45 min at 32°C) in the
presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy).
Puromycin selection (0.5 µg/ml) was initiated two days
after transduction. Once a cellular clone was established,
to induce CK1α silencing, cells were incubated with
500/1000 µM IPTG every two/three days for a total of
one (in the case of shRNA#1 and shRNA#3) or two (in the
case of shRNA#2) weeks, time lapse in which we obtained
the best results in terms of CK1α knockdown efficacy.

Data obtained were evaluated for their statistical
significance with the two-tail paired Student’s t test or
ANOVA analysis of variance with post-hoc corrections,
with the Chi square test for trend. Conventional statistical
procedures were applied using standard packages of the R
software. Values were considered statistically significant at
p values below 0.05.
