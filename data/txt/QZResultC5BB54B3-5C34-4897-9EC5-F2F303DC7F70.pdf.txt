Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Effective clinical management of prostate cancer (PCA) has been challenged by significant
intratumoural heterogeneity on the genomic and pathological levels and limited understanding of
the genetic elements governing disease progression1. Here,we exploited the experimental merits of
the mouse to test the hypothesis that pathways constraining progression might be activated in
indolent Pten-null mouse prostate tumours and that inactivation of such progression barriers in
mice would engender a metastasis-prone condition. Comparative transcriptomic and canonical
pathway analyses, followed by biochemical confirmation, of normal prostate epithelium versus
poorly progressive Pten-null prostate cancers revealed robust activation of the TGFβ/BMP–
SMAD4 signalling axis. The functional relevance of SMAD4 was further supported by emergence
of invasive, metastatic and lethal prostate cancers with 100% penetrance upon genetic deletion of
Smad4 in the Pten-null mouse prostate. Pathological and molecular analysis as well as
transcriptomic knowledge-based pathway profiling of emerging tumours identified cell
proliferation and invasion as two cardinal tumour biological features in the metastatic Smad4/
Pten-null PCA model. Follow-on pathological and functional assessment con-firmed cyclin D1
and SPP1 as key mediators of these biological processes, which together with PTEN and SMAD4,
form a four-gene signature that is prognostic of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical
recurrence and lethal metastasis in human PCA. This model-informed progression analysis,
together with genetic, functional and translational studies, establishes SMAD4 as a key regulator
of PCA progression in mice and humans.

Adenocarcinoma of the prostate (PCA) is the most common form of cancer and the second
leading cause of cancer death in American men2. Current methods of stratifying tumours to
predict outcome are based on clinical-pathological factors including Gleason grade, PSA
and tumour stage3. These parameters are widely considered inadequate, which has motivated
the genetic and biological study of PCA progression with the goal of identifying progression
risk biomarkers capable of improving patient management4.
Genetic studies of human PCA has identified signature pathogenetic events5, a number of
which have been validated and mechanistically defined in genetically engineered mouse
models of PCA6. Prostate-specific Pten deletion (Ptenpc−/−) results in prostate intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN) which, following a long latency, can progress to high-grade
adenocarcinoma, albeit with minimally invasive and metastatic features7–10. To understand
this feeble progression phenotype, we conducted transcriptome comparison of Ptenpc−/− PIN
relative to wild-type prostate epithelium (Supplementary Data 1). In addition to the expected
PI3K and p53 (also known as TRP53) pathway representation8, knowledge-based pathway
analysis revealed prominent TGFβ/BMP signalling in Ptenpc−/− PIN (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Immunohistochemical and western blotting analyses of Smad4 expression confirmed robust
increase in Ptenpc−/− PIN compared to wild-type prostate epithelium (Fig. 1a, b). In line with
reported down-regulated expression of SMAD4 in a subset of human primary prostate
tumours11, Oncomine expression analysis showed consistent SMAD4 downregulation in

human PCA metastasis (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2).Loss of SMAD4 in advanced
PCA is further supported by recent report of frequent epigenetic silencing of the SMAD4
promoter in advanced disease12. On the functional level, SMAD4 knockdown in PC3
showed significantly enhanced frequency of metastases to the lung from renal capsule
implantation (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3). These observations prompted speculation
that a SMAD4-dependent barrier constrains PCA progression.
To obtain genetic evidence that Smad4 extinction enables progression, we engineered mice
harbouring Pb-Cre4 and conditional knockout alleles of Pten and/or Smad4 (designated
Ptenpc−/− and Smad4pc−/−) and confirmed prostate-specific deletion (Supplementary Fig. 4).
At 7 weeks of age, both Ptenpc−/− and Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− models develop low-grade PIN
(Fig. 2a). Consistent with previous studies7,8, Ptenpc−/− mice acquired invasive features after
19 weeks of age and most survived beyond 1year of age (Fig. 2b). In contrast, Ptenpc−/−
Smad4pc−/− mice developed focally invasive PCA by 11 weeks (Fig. 2a, arrow) and highly
aggressive invasive PCA with stromal reaction by 15weeks of age (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Fig. 5). All Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− mice died by 32 weeks of age due largely
to bladder outlet obstruction which caused hydronephrosis and renal failure (Fig. 2b,c and
Supplementary Fig.6),where as Smad4pc−/− mice showed no prostate neoplasia beyond
2years of age (Fig.2b and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Molecular pathological analysis of PCA-bearing Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− mice showed
metastatic spread of Krt8 and androgen receptor-positive (Krt8+, Ar+) tumour nodules to
draining lumbar lymph nodes in 25/ 25 cases and lung metastases in 3/25 cases (0.3–3 mm
diameter metastatic nodules)(Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig.8 and Supplementary Table 1).
The histological features of these metastases resembled those of the primary prostate tumour
(Fig. 2d). These observations are in contrast to the Ptenpc−/− PCA-bearing mice which never
developed metastatic lesions when examined at 1year of age (n = 10), and only two
mice(2/8)older than 1.5 years of age contained a solitary lumbar lymph node metastasis and
one of these mice also possessed a solitary lung micrometastasis (Supplementary Table 1), a
constrained progression phenotype that aligns with previous reports7–9. Similarly, 0/20
Ptenpc−/− p53pc−/− PCA-bearing mice developed metastasis during the same observation
period (data not shown).

Having demonstrated the distinctly different metastatic potential of the Ptenpc−/−, Ptenpc−/−
Smad4pc−/−, and Ptenpc−/− p53pc−/− models, we then compared transcriptomes of primary
PCAs from each to gain insight into the molecular determinants of their phenotypic
differences. First, primary anterior prostate tumours with comparable sizes were harvested
from 15-week-old animals from each model for mRNA profiling. Comparisons of Ptenpc−/−
Smad4pc−/− (n = 5) versus Ptenpc−/− (n = 5) or Ptenpc−/− p53pc−/− (n = 3) with Ptenpc−/− (n =
5) prostate tumour transcriptomes defined the Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− or Ptenpc−/− p53pc−/−
signatures (Supplementary Data 2, 3). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to
generate hypotheses on the biological processes that underlie the metastatic phenotype in the
Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− PCAs. In contrast to the Ptenpc−/− p53pc−/− signatures, we found that
the two most significantly enriched gene-categories in the Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− signature
are ‘cellular movement’ and ‘cellular growth and proliferation’ (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Enrichment of cell growth and proliferation genes in Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− PCA concurs
with histopathological observations of markedly increased proliferation index relative to
Ptenpc−/− tumours (Fig. 3a, b). Increased proliferation index was not associated with changes
in apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 10), but rather neutralization of oncogene-induced
senescence (OIS) as reflected by loss of senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining (Fig.
3a, b). A survey of key regulators of G1/S transition and OIS revealed significant induction
of cyclin D1 protein but without significant changes in p53, p21 (also known as Cdkn1a)

and p27 (also known as Cdkn1b) in Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− relative to Ptenpc−/− tumours (Fig.
3c and Supplementary Fig. 11). Complementing this hypothesis-driven survey, cyclin D1
was computationally identified as the only cell cycle regulator in the Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/−
signature that both exhibits human PCA progression-correlated expression in Oncomine and
harbours putative SMAD-binding elements (SBEs) in its promoter lifespan in the Ptenpc−/−
Smad4pc−/− compared with the Ptenpc−/− cohort. c, Gross anatomy of representative

(Supplementary Data 2). Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed
that SMAD4 can bind to one of the SBEs in the cyclin D1 gene promoter (Supplementary
Figs 12 and 13). Correspondingly, TGFβ1 (also known as TGFB1)-treated SMAD4transduced Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− prostate tumour cells show down-regulated cyclin D1
expression (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Finally, enforced cyclin D1 expression significantly
enhanced xenograft tumour growth in vivo (Fig. 3d). Together, these data support the thesis
that cyclin D1 is a key mediator of the cardinal tumour biological feature of increased
proliferation in the metastatic Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− model.

We next obtained available ORFs corresponding to 21 of the 84 ‘Cellular Movement’ genes
(Supplementary Table 2) and assayed their ability to enhance invasion of human prostate
cancer cells. Using the modified Boyden chamber assay, 10/21 ORFs enhanced invasion of
prostate cancer cells including PC3 (Supplementary Table 2). Among these validated
invasion genes, SPP1 was selected for deeper analysis given its PCA progression-correlated
expression in Oncomine, its prognostic potential for BCR in univariate COX proportional
hazard analysis in a data set comprising of transcriptome and outcome data on 79 PCA
patients (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4)13, and its known link to TGFβ signalling under
different cellular contexts1–6. Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses
confirmed increased Spp1 expression in Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− compared to Ptenpc−/−
tumours (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 11) and promoter analysis17 identified a conserved
SBE in the Spp1 promoter which was confirmed by ChIP assay in cells treated with TGFβ1
(Supplementary Fig. 15). In contrast to previous studies showing Smad4 as an inducer of
Spp1 expression through displacement of transcription repressors from Spp1 promoter in a
mink lung epithelial cell line and a preosteoblastic cell line14,16, loss of Smad4 in the
Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− prostate tumour cells results in markedly increased Spp1
expression(Fig.3c and Supplementary Data 2). TGFβ1 treatment correspondingly
suppressed Spp1 expression in SMAD4-dependent manner in Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− prostate
tumour cells (Supplementary Fig. 14b). These observations underscore the context-specific
actions of TGFβ-SMAD4 signalling on its downstream targets18. Next, to verify that Spp1
functionally contributes to the metastatic phenotype in our model, we showed significant
inhibition of invasive activity in vitro upon knockdown of Spp1 in Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/−
mouse PCA cells (Supplementary Fig. 16). Conversely, enforced SPP1 expression enhanced
invasion in vitro of several human lines (Supplementary Fig. 17). Finally, orthotopic
implantation of SPP1-transduced PC3 cells in the prostate exhibited increased lumbar lymph
node metastasis and enhanced metastasis to lung (Fig. 3e–f and Supplementary Fig. 18).
These results strongly indicated that SPP1 is a pro-metastasis invasion gene in human PCA
and in the Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− PCA model.
The in vivo genetic modelling studies, the in silico transcriptomic and pathway analyses,
along with the tumour biological and functional characterizations collectively point to the
inactivation of Pten and Smad4 as well as activation of cyclin D1 (also known as Ccnd1)
and Spp1 as drivers of PCA progression. As such, we posited that these four key PCA
metastasis progression relevant genes may carry prognostic value for metastasis risk in
human PCA (see Supplementary Fig. 19). To this end, we assessed how robustly these four

genes can stratify risk of BCR (> 0.2 ng ml−1) in the data set from ref. 13. Although only
SPP1 was significantly correlated with BCR in univariate analysis, an overall risk score
integrating the four-gene signature by multivariate Cox regression showed significant
association with BCR as well (P-value = 0.0025, and overall C-index = 0.66, see
Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Furthermore, the four-gene model robustly stratified the ref.
13 cohort by K-mean clustering into two groups that exhibited significant difference in risk
for BCR by Kaplan–Meier analysis (Fig. 4a; hazard ratio = 2.6, log-rank test P = 0.012).
Importantly, by C-statistics, this four-gene signature carries independent prognostic
information as it can enhance the prognostic accuracy of Gleason score from C-index from
0.77 to 0.8 (Fig. 4b), even though by itself, the four-gene signature (C-index as 0.75)
performs only as well as Gleason score alone (Fig. 4b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We repeated this analysis in an independent extreme-case-control cohort derived from the
Physicians' Health Study (PHS) (Supplementary Table 6; see Methods for study design),
where we showed that the four-gene model was also capable of enhancing the prognostic
accuracy of Gleason score in predicting metastatic lethal outcome (Fig. 4c; C = 0.716 by
four-gene signature). Although exclusion of non-informative cases may have biased towards
a positive association, the prognostic performance by this four-gene signature is unlikely a
chance occurrence because, by gene-set-enrichment testing, it outperforms 243 other
bidirectional signatures curated in the Molecular Signature Databases of the Broad Institute
(MSigDB, version 2.5) in predicting metastatic lethal outcome in this PHS extreme-casecontrol cohort (Supplementary Fig. 20).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Encouraged by the prognostic value in two independent cohorts using RNA expression yet
mindful of the inherent intra-tumoural heterogeneity of PCA which may obscure expression
differences in whole-tumour transcriptome profiles, we next performed
immunohistochemical staining with validated antibodies against PTEN, SMAD4, cyclin D1
and SPP1 on a tumour tissue microarrays (TMA) comprising a cohort of 405 tumour
specimens randomly selected from men diagnosed with prostate cancer who underwent
radical prostatectomy in the PHS cohort. Staining results were quantified by expert
pathologists (R.L. and M.L.) blinded to the outcome of the cases. Indeed, not only does the
four-protein model improve the prognostic accuracy of Gleason score in combination, it
performs significantly better than Gleason score alone (Fig. 4d; C = 0.774 for Gleason only,
C = 0.829 for four-protein model alone, and C = 0.882 for Gleason + four-protein model; P
= 0.015 for improvement). Moreover, the addition of the four-protein model to the clinical
parameters (Gleason, age at diagnosis, TNM stage; C = 0.842) leads to a significant seven
point increase in the C-statistic (C = 0.913), P-value for difference between full clinical
model versus clinical model + four-protein signature = 0.047 (Supplementary Table 7). The
enhanced prognostic value of ‘Gleason + four-protein model’ was similarly validated in yet
another independent cohort, the Directors Challenge TMA containing 40 prostate cancer
patients with recurrence as outcome (Supplementary Table 8) (Fig. 4e and Supplementary
Fig. 19c; C = 0.704 for Gleason alone versus C = 0.740 for Gleason + four-protein model).
In summary, concomitant Pten and Smad4 inactivation in the prostate epithelium can bypass
OIS, enhance tumour cell proliferation and drive invasion to produce a fully-penetrant
invasive and metastatic PCA phenotype in the mouse (Supplementary Fig. 21). The human
relevance of this Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− model of metastatic PCA is credentialed by the
prognostic significance of a four-marker signature derived from this mouse model in
predicting biochemical recurrence or lethal metastasis in human PCAs. Thus this study will
facilitate the development of a molecularly-based prognostic assay that may complement the
current standard of care to improve evidence-based management of PCA patients, a current
major unmet need.

Establishment of mouse prostate tumour cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumours were dissected from prostates of Ptenloxp/loxp Smad4loxp/loxp PB-Cre4+ (Ptenpc−/−
Smad4pc−/−) mice, minced, and digested with 0.5% type I collagenase (Invitrogen) as
described previously. After filtering through a 40-μm mesh, the trapped fragments were
plated in tissue culture dishes coated with type I collagen (BD Pharmingen). Cells with
typical epithelial morphology were collected, and single cells were seeded into each well of
a 96-well plate. Three independent cell lines (Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/−-1, -2 and -3,) were
established and maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Omega
Scientific), 25 μg ml−1 bovine pituitary extract, 5 μg ml−1 bovine insulin, and 6 ng ml−1
recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich). The prostate tumour
epithelial cells express epithelial marker CK8 detected by immunofluorescence analyses
using CK8 (GTX15465, GeneTex) antibody.
Establishment of inducible Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− SMAD4-TetOn cell lines

Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− prostate tumour cells (see above) were used as parental cells for
establishment of inducible SMAD4 TetOn cells using TetOn Advanced Inducible Gene
Expression System (Clontech). Human SMAD4 coding region inserted into the pTRE-Tight

vector, and a TetOn SMAD4 expression system was generated according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Stable clones were induced to express SMAD4 using 1 μg ml−1
doxycycline (dox), and expression was verified to be comparable to the SMAD4 level in
Ptenpc−/− prostate tumours by western blot analysis of whole-cell extracts, using antiSMAD4 antibody (sc-21742, Santa Cruz) (Supplementary Fig. 12).
RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol followed by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) cleanup and
RQ1 RNase-free DNase Set treatment (Promega) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA and Superscript II
(Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in triplicates with a MxPro3000
and SYBR GreenER qPCR mix (Invitrogen). The relative amount of specific mRNA was
normalized to Gapdh. Primer sequences are available upon request.
Transcriptomic and pathway analyses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For transcriptomic analyses, anterior prostate from mice at 15weeks of age were isolated and
total mRNA extracted, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430
2.0 Arrays by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Microarray Core Facility according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Affymetrix mouse MOE430 raw data (CEL files) were preprocessed using robust multi-array analysis (RMA) of the Affy package of Bioconductor.
The background-corrected, normalized and summarized probe set intensity data were then
analysed using significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) to identify differentially
expressed genes. Using a twofold, FDR 5% cut-off, we generated a 3,532 probe set that
distinguishes differentially expressed genes in anterior prostate samples from Ptenpc−/− (five
mice) versus WT (PB-Cre4) (three mice), 397 probe sets that distinguishes differentially
expressed genes in anterior prostate samples from Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− (five mice) versus
Ptenpc−/− (five mice), and 370 probe sets that distinguishes differentially expressed genes in
Ptenpc−/− p53pc−/− (three mice) versus Ptenpc−/− (five mice). Gene information for all probes
was annotated based on ‘Mouse430_2.na28.annot.csv’ downloaded from the Affymetrix
website. Probes with multiple genes in the Affymetrix annotation file were mapped against
latest mouse genome build (UCSC mm9) for the single matching gene. Probes mapped to
more than one position on mm9 were ignored. Human orthologues of mouse genes were
extracted from HomoloGene build 64(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/). Intersection
of the murine list with the human orthologous genes produced an orthologous set of genes.

All differentially expressed gene lists generated as described above were further analysed
with the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis program (http://www.ingenuity.com/index.html) to
identify canonical pathways, and molecular and cellular functions enriched in the related
gene lists.
cDNA and shRNA constructs
Human cDNAs presented in Supplementary Table 1 were obtained from the Human
ORFeome collection, Japan National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Japan,
and transferred into a modified pMSCV-V5 vector via Gateway recombination. Knockdown
of human SMAD4 and mouse Spp1 were performed by infecting the indicated cells with
lentivirus containing either shSMAD4 or shSpp1 (provided by W. Hahn). The shRNA

Viral production and transduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Approximately 2 × 106 293T cells were seeded in 100 mm plates 15h before transfection
(∼30% confluent) in 10% FBS/DMEM with antibiotics. For MSCV viral production, 3 μg
viral backbone, 2.7 μg gag/pol expression vectors, and 0.3 μg VSV-G expression vector
were diluted to 20 μl using Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and combined with 180ml Opti-MEM
containing 12 μl FuGENE-6 (Roche). This mixture was incubated at room temperature (RT)
for 20 min and added to the 10 ml media covering the 293T cells. For pLKO shRNA
lentivirus production, 10 μg of viral backbone and 10 μg of lentiviral packaging vectors
were diluted to 1,000 μl using Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The resulting mix was combined
with 1,000 μl Opti-MEM containing 30 μl Liptofectamine2000 (Invitrogen), incubated at
room temperature for 20 min and added to 8 ml media covering the 293T cells. The media
was replaced with 10% FBS/DMEM approximately 10 h post-transfection and viral
supernatants were collected at 36 h and 60 h after transfection and combined. Viral
supernatants (5 ml) containing 8 μg ml−1 polybrene were added to target cells that were
seeded 24 h before infection at 70–80% confluence. Cells were infected twice and allowed
to recover in 10% FBS/RPMI 1640 with antibiotics for 12 h following the second infection,
after which cells were selected with 2 μg ml−1 puromycin for 4 days and allowed to recover
in normal medium for 24 h before further experiments.
Transwell invasion assay
Standard 24-well Boyden invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) were used to assess cell
invasiveness following the manufacturer's suggestions. Briefly, cells were trypsinized,
rinsed twice with PBS, resuspended in serum-free media, and seeded at 2 × 105 cells per
well for PC3 cells and Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− cells, 4 × 105 cells per well for BPH1 cells.
Chambers in triplicate were placed in 10% serum-containing media as a chemo-attractant
and an equal number of cells were seeded in cell culture plates in triplicate as input controls.
Following 22 h incubation, chambers were fixedin 10% formalin, stained with crystal violet
for manual counting or by pixel quantification with Adobe Photoshop. Data was normalized
to input cells to control for differences in cell number (loading control).
Orthotopic and renal capsule implantation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Male SCID mice (6 weeks old) were obtained from Taconic. Orthotopic and renal capsule
implantations were performed as described previously25,26. Briefly, a suspension of 1 × 106
cells in 50 μl of a 1:1 mixture of PBS and Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was injected into the
anterior prostate lobe. For renal capsule implantation 5 × 105 cells were suspended in 50 μl
of neutralized type I rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences), allowed to gel at 37 °C for 15min,
covered with growth medium, followed by grafting beneath the renal capsule of mice.
Identification of putative SMAD binding sites (SBEs)
The Smad binding elements (SBEs) in the promoters of the Ptenpc−/− Smad4pc−/− signature
of 267 genes were identified computationally by established methods16. Briefly, the
conserved nucleotides in the 4kb promoter regions of the promoters were isolated and
scanned for enrichment of the SMAD binding motifs in TRANSFAC. Enrichment was
assessed by comparing the target regions to matched control regions at the same distance
from the transcription start sites of random genes. Promoter analysis on these gene sets for
SBEs used the CisGenome software (http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/∼hji/cisgenome/).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ChIP assays with 1 μg of normal mouse IgG (Upstate), normal rabbit IgG (Upstate), antiRNA polymerase II (PoII) (Upstate), anti-acetyl-Histone H3 (Upstate) or anti-SMAD4 IgG
(mouse monoclonal, clone B8, sc-7966, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C were conducted by
established methods16.
Immunohistochemical evaluation of outcome tissue microarrays (TMAs)
Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 5-μm sections of the TMAs to assess
cytoplasmic PTEN (PN37, rabbit polyclonal, 18-0256, Zymed), cytoplasmic SMAD4
(mouse monoclonal, clone B8, sc-7966, Santa Cruz), nuclear cyclin D1 (Rabbit monoclonal,
SP4, RM-9104-R7, Thermo Scientific), and cytoplasmic SPP1 expression (Rabbit
polyclonal, O17, 18625, IBL) after citrate-based antigen retrieval.

TMA slides were scanned using the CRi Nuance v2.8 (Woburn) slide scanner following the
standard bright field TMA protocol. The system acquires images at 20nm intervals and
combines them into a stack file which represents one image. This was done automatically to
create one image for each core on the TMA. The maximum likelihood method was used to
extract the spectra of DAB and haematoxylin, which represent the different elements of
IHC. inForm v0.4.2 software (CRi) was used to analyse the spectral images of each core.
Initially, a training set comprising two classes of tissue was created: ‘tumor’ and ‘other’.
Representative areas for each class were marked on 12–16 images from each TMA. The
software was trained on these areas using the spectra of both the counterstain (haematoxylin)
and the immunostain (DAB) and tested to determine how accurate it could differentiate
between the two classes. This process was repeated until further iterations no longer
improved accuracy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Histological images were then analysed using the ‘nuclear or cytoplasmic’ algorithm. The
multispectral imaging capabilities of the Nuanc slide scanner allows the software to isolate
or segment the nuclei using the unmixed spectra of the nuclear counterstain and the DAB
immunohistochemical stain used in addition for a nuclear biomarker. In turn, cytoplasm is
found based on the non-nuclear tumour area. Threshold settings approximated: scale1,offset
subtraction0,minimum blob size 30, maximum blob size 10,000, circularity threshold 0,
edge sharpness 0, fill hole enabled (nuclear parameters); algorithm 4, area 200, compactness
0.5, Wht threshold 225 (cytoplasmic parameters). The final score was based on the
percentage of the cytoplasmic or nuclear tumour area that was positively stained and this
was represented as a ten bin histogram. This involved each pixel being placed into one of ten
bins based on the intensity of the DAB spectra, with an adjustment of the threshold for the
9th bin by the user in order to create a desirable distribution. By reviewing images and their
scores, a threshold level of these bins was determined that represented real staining, and the
values from the bins above this threshold were added together to create a final score which
represented the per-centage of cytoplasmic or nuclear area that waspositively stained. All
samples were also reviewed by pathologists (R.L. and M.L.) to ensure that assigned scores
were appropriate. TMA cores that were difficult to classify (due to technical artefacts such
as folds in the tissue, air bubbles, cores overlapping or due to difficulty in morphological
classification) were either eliminated from the analysis in order to categorize the tissue
appropriately. The Directors Challenge TMA originally contained 52 patient samples27.
However, as is typical of most heavily used TMAs, some of the samples become exhausted
over time from extensive use by the M.L. lab and the community. After careful quality
control of each core on the TMA by R.L. in M.L. lab, only 40 high quality core samples
were considered usable (Supplementary Table 7). Careful quality control of each core on the
PHS TMA by R.L. in the M.L. lab, 405 high quality core samples were considered usable
(Supplementary Table 5).

Clinical outcome analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The raw Affymetrix HG-U133A expression profiles and clinical information of 79 prostate
cancer patients from the ref. 13 cohort (Supplementary Table 2)12 were generously provided
by W. Gerald. The raw data set was analysed by MAS5 algorithm. Low-expression
probesets with less than 20% present calls across the 79 samples were excluded from the
data. The remaining 13,027 probesets map to 8,763 genes with unique symbols, and the
mean log-transformed probeset levels were used as the gene expression profiles.
A univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was conducted using the R ‘survival’ package
for invasion assay positive genes to identify those expression in PCA tumours was positively
associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR, defined by post-op PSA > 0.2 ng ml−1) in the
ref. 13 data set12.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

K-means clustering algorithm was used with the PTEN/SMAD4/CCND1/SPP1 four-gene
model to identify two cancer sample clusters. The initial centres for the K-means clustering
were set at the two cases with the longest Euclidean distance. Kaplan–Meier analysis for the
survival difference of the two cancer patient clusters was conducted using the R ‘survival’
package. C-statistics analysis was conducted using the R ‘survcomp’ package. The statistical
procedures used in the analyses include a bootstrapping step that estimates the distribution
of C-statistics of all models across 10,000 random bootstrapping instances, and a
comparative step that uses the paired t-test to compare the C-statistics of models and
evaluate the statistical significance28. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis
with the four-gene signature was used to estimate the coefficients of individual genes, which
combined the four-gene expression levels into an integrated risk score model defined.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To validate further the prognostic significance of this four-gene model, we repeated this
analysis in an independent cohort derived from the Directors Challenge cohort27
(Supplementary Table 7) and the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) cohort. PHS cohort
(Supplementary Table 5): the men with prostate cancer included in this study were
participants in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS), an ongoing randomized trial among US
male physicians29,30. The men were diagnosed with histologically-confirmed prostate cancer
after randomization, between January 1983 and December 2004. We obtained archival
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens, either radical prostatectomy (95%) or
TURP (5%) and constructed tumour tissue microarrays for immunohistochemical analyses;
405 had sufficient tumour tissue available for this project. All men in the trial were followed
for mortality, and cause of death was confirmed by a study endpoints committee. In
addition, we retrieved medical records and questionnaire data on the men with prostate
cancer to collect information on treatments, clinical characteristics, as well progression of
the cancer. Through March 2010, 38 men of 405 had developed a lethal metastatic
phenotype, defined by bony metastases or cancer-specific death.
We undertook gene expression profiling as part of a previous project to define molecular
signatures in prostate cancer31 on a subset of the PHS included on the TMAs. As part of the
sampling, we sought to maximize efficiency for studies of lethal prostate cancer by devising
a study design that included men who either died from prostate cancer or developed
metastases during follow up (‘lethal prostate cancer’ cases) or who survived at least 10 years
after their diagnosis without any evidence of metastases (men with ‘indolent prostate
cancer’).We sought to include all lethal cancers, based on follow-up through March 2007,
and took a random sample of indolent cancers for a total sample size of 116 cases. In this
design, we exclude men with non-informative outcomes, namely those who died from other
causes within 10 years of their prostate cancer diagnosis or had been followed for less than
10 years with no disease progression. The natural history of prostate cancer is quite long,
with men dying of prostate cancer even 15 or more years after cancer diagnosis32. Thus, we

excluded prostate cancer cases with less than 10 years follow-up to increase confidence on
the outcome annotation since we are not seeking to estimate survival time. By focusing on
long-follow-up cases, an extreme-case-control study design allows us to maximally identify
lethal versus indolent prostate cancer. In addition, to minimize the potential that C-statistics
estimation might be biased towards a higher lethal composition by such extreme-case-studydesign, we have chosen a logistic regression analysis rather estimating survival analysis.
The tissue based studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Harvard
School of Public Health and Partners Healthcare.
We assessed the enrichment of the four-gene signature to that of 244 bidirectional signatures
curated in the Molecular Signature Databases of the Broad Institute (MSigDB, version 2.5)
by computing an enrichment statistic33.
