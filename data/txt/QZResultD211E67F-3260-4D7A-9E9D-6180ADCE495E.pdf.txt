Abstract
The fast proliferation of cancer cells requires reprogramming of its energy
metabolism with aerobic glycolysis as a major energy source. Sirt6, a class III
histone deacetylase, has been shown to down regulate glycolysis by inhibiting the
expression of several key glycolytic genes. Based on the published study on the
metabolic phenotype of E2F1 -/- mice and SIRT6 -/- mice, we hypothesize that E2F1
enhances glycolysis and inhibits the expression of Sirt6. Indeed, over-expressing of
E2F1, but not its DNA binding deficient mutant, significantly enhanced glucose uptake
and lactate production in bladder and prostate cancer cell lines. E2F1 over-expression
also suppressed Sirt6 expression and function. Moreover, E2F1 directly bound to Sirt6
promoter and suppressed Sirt6 promoter activity under both normoxic and hypoxic
culture conditions. E2F1 siRNA blocked the up-regulation of E2F1 under hypoxia,
increased Sirt6 expression and decreased glycolysis compared to those of scrambled
siRNA transected cells. Furthermore, HDAC1 deacetylated E2F1 and diminished its
transcription suppression of Sirt6 promoter. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor,
trichostatin A (TSA), suppressed Sirt6 promoter activity with increased binding of
acetylated E2F1 to Sirt6 promoter. Mutating the E2F1 binding site on the proximal
Sirt6 promoter abolished the suppression of Sirt6 transcription by TSA. These data
indicate a novel oncogenic role of E2F1, i.e. enhancing glycolysis by suppressing Sirt6
transcription.

INTRODUCTION

expression of glycolytic genes in BAT and GNM of E2F1
-/- mice [2]. In the past few years, accumulating evidence
has highlighted the role of SIRT6, a member of the class
III histone deacetylases in regulating cell metabolism
[3-4]. Through studies of SIRT6 -/- mice and SIRT6 -/mouse Embryonic Stem cells, Zhong et al showed that
SIRT6 co-repressed the hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF1a, by deacetylating histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) in the
promoter of key glycolytic genes like Glucose transporter
type1 (GLUT1) and Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase,
Isoenzyme 1 (PDK1) [3]. SIRT6 -/- mice therefore have
uncontrolled glycolysis and died by 1 month of age due to
a precipitous decrease in serum glucose. Enhanced aerobic
glycolysis was mostly observed in BAT and muscle [3].
This metabolic phenotype is in direct contrast of the E2F1
-/- mice, suggesting that E2F1 may down regulate SIRT6

As a founding member of E2F family of
transcription factors, E2F1 participates in regulating
cell-cycle progression, cell differentiation, DNA repair,
and apoptosis. Depending on the cellular context
and environmental conditions, it can function as
either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene. Early
studies indicated that dysregulation of E2F1 predicted
invasive bladder and skin tumors, and also mediated
chemoresistance [1]. Further studies with the E2F1
-/- mice revealed enhanced oxidative metabolism and
diminished glycolytic metabolism in brown adipose
tissue (BAT) and gastrocnemius muscle (GNM) [2]. This
phenotype is mediated through enhanced expression of
genes involved in oxidative metabolism and diminished

to facilitate glucose metabolism.
Reprogramming of energy metabolism has emerged
as a new hallmark of cancer. Genetic alterations in RAS
and MYC have been shown to create addictions of cancer
cells to certain metabolic pathways [5]. We hypothesize
that the oncogenic role of E2F1 can also be attributed to
its promotion of glycolysis through suppressing SIRT6
expression and activity in cancer cells. The only published
report on SIRT6 regulation to date came from studies with
a mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa1-6, which showed that
a complex of SIRT1, FOXO3a and NRF1 up-regulated
SIRT6 upon nutritional stress [6]. It is unclear whether
this complex directly regulated SIRT6 transcription at
the promoter region. In our study, we find that there is
an E2F binding site at the proximal SIRT6 promoter.
Although E2F1 has been shown to primarily function as
a positive regulator of transcription, it can function as
a transcriptional repressor either alone [7-8] or through
association with specific co-factors, such as HDAC1 [9]
and DNMT1 [10]. Among different cancer types, E2F1
overexpression has been linked to tumor progression in
prostate and bladder cancers [11-12], which indicates a
tumor promoting role of E2F1 in these cancer types. In
addition to inhibiting aerobic glycolysis, SIRT6 has been
shown to promote genomic stability through facilitating
DNA repair [13-15], attenuate inflammation through
damping NF-κB-dependent gene expression [16], and
function like a tumor suppressor through repressing
Warburg effect in cancer cells [17].
Here we tested our hypothesis in bladder and
prostate cancer cell lines and found that E2F1 could
indeed suppress SIRT6 transcription and promote cancer
cell glycolysis. Mechanistically, E2F1 directly bound to
the proximal SIRT6 promoter and formed a complex with
HDAC1. Deacetylation of E2F1 by HDAC1 facilitated
SIRT6 transcription by dissociating E2F1 from the SIRT6
promoter region.

[3]. The lack of activity with over-expressing E2F1 (E138)
indicates that E2F1 needs to bind to DNA to enhance
glycolysis (Figure 1B).
To test further that SIRT6 is involved in the
enhanced glycolysis after E2F1 over-expression, glucose
uptake and lactate production were compared among
pcDNA3.1 vector transfected PC3 cells and PC3 cells
over-expressing SIRT6, E2F1, or both. As shown in
Figure 1C, glycolysis was suppressed after SIRT6 overexpression and enhanced after E2F1 over-expression.
Over-expression of both E2F1 and SIRT6 had a glycolysis
level similar to SIRT6 over-expression. These data
indicate repressing SIRT6 is required in the regulation of
glycolysis by E2F1.

E2F1 binds to SIRT6 promoter and suppresses its
transcription
As a class III histone deacetylase, SIRT6 is known
to deacetylate the acetylation at H3K9 [3]. Indeed,
decreased SIRT6 protein after over-expressing E2F1 in
PC3 and UMUC3 cells led to increased H3K9 acetylation
compared to vector transfected cells (Figure 2A). The
decrease in SIRT6 after E2F1 over expression was also
detected at the RNA level (Figure 2B). Of note, there is
an E2F1 binding site at the proximal SIRT6 promoter.
No potential E2F1 binding sties were identified on the
GLUT1 or PDK1 promoter. We therefore performed dual
reporter luciferase assay after cotransfecting the pcDNAE2F1 construct with the SIRT6 promoter pGL3 reporter
construct. Compared to pcDNA3.1 vector transfected
cells, over-expressing E2F1 suppressed SIRT6 promoter
activity. Minimum suppressions of Sirt6 promoter
activities were observed after cotransfecting the DNA
binding deficient E2F1(E138) with the SIRT6 promoter
reporter construct (Figure 2C). We then mutated the E2F1
binding site on the Sirt6 promoter with strategies reported
previously [18]. Neither E2F1 nor E2F1 (E138) could
suppress Sirt6 promoter activities when the Sirt6 promoter
with mutated E2F1 binding site was used in the reporter
assay (Figure 2C).
To confirm that E2F1 directly binds to SIRT6
promoter, ChIP assay was performed on SIRT promoter
with anti-E2F1 pull down. Compared to empty vector
transfected cells, over expression of E2F1 led to increased
binding of E2F1 to the SIRT6 promoter as detected by the
ChIP assay (Figure 2D). A 200 bp fragment, 1kb upstream
of the SIRT6 promoter E2F1 binding site, was amplified
in the lysate pulled down with anti-E2F1. Given there is
no known E2F1 binding site in this region, the absence of
this fragment served as a negative control.

RESULTS
Over-expression of E2F1 enhances glycolysis
through repressing SIRT6
To test the role of E2F1 in regulating glycolysis, we
over-expressed E2F1 or its DNA binding deficient mutant
E2F1 (E138) in PC3 prostate cancer and UMUC3 bladder
cancer cells. Compared to pcDNA3.1 vector transfected
cells, a significant increase in glucose uptake and lactate
production was observed after over expressing E2F1,
but not E2F1 (E138) (Figure 1A). Compared to vector
or E2F1 (E138) transfected cells, E2F1 over-expression
led to decreased SIRT6 and increased expression of key
glycolysis proteins, GLUT1 and PDK1. Both GLUT1 and
PDK1 transcriptions were normally repressed by SIRT6

luciferase assays. Compared to those under normoxic
conditions, SIRT6 promoter activity was significantly
decreased in PC3 and UMUC3 cells under hypoxia. The
recovery of SIRT6 promoter activity after mutating E2F1
binding site on its proximal promoter was seen under
normoxia as well as hypoxia, but significant at a greater
extent under hypoxia (Figure 3D). Consistent with what
we observed with the E2F1 over-expression experiment
(Figure 2D), the increase of E2F1 under hypoxia was
associated with increased binding of E2F1 to the SIRT6
promoter in the CHIP assay (Figure 3E).

To test further the negative regulation of SIRT6
by E2F1, siRNA was used to inhibit E2F1 expression
(Figure 4A). Compared to un-transfected and scrambled
siRNA transfected UMUC3 cells, knocking down E2F1
with siRNA increased SIRT6 protein, RNA and promoter
activity (Figure 4A and 4B). The increases in Srit6 and
decreases in GLUT1 and PDK1 proteins after knocking
down E2F1 were observed under both normoxia and

hypoxia (Figure 4D). Consistent with these changes
at the gene expression level, significant decreases of
glucose uptake and lactate production were observed at
the function level after knocking down E2F1 with siRNA
under both normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions
(Figure 4E). Given glycolysis was enhanced under
hypoxia; the decrease in glycolysis after knocking down
E2F1 was more significant under hypoxia compared
to normoxia (Figure 4E). These data support further
that increased E2F1 expression and subsequent downregulation of SIRT6 expression is a main mechanism for
enhanced glycolysis in these cell lines.

HDAC1 has been shown to be recruited to the
promoters of E2F1 target genes. It deacetylates E2F1 and
diminishes the binding of E2F1 to its downstream gene
promoters [19]. We then studied whether HDAC1 used
the same mechanism to diminish the regulation of SIRT6
transcription by E2F1. As shown in Figure 5A, complex
formation between E2F1 and HDAC1 was detected with
immunoprecipitation in bladder and prostate cancer
cells (Figure 5A). Knocking down HDAC1 with siRNA
decreased SIRT6 level in PC3 cell (Figure 5B). To study
whether the deacetylase activity of HDAC1 is involved in
this regulation, H141A, an HDAC1 mutant that lacks the

histone deacetylase activity, or the empty vector was then
over-expressed in PC3 and UMUC3 cells. Compared to
their empty vector transfected counterparts, decreases in
E2F1 acetylation and increase in SIRT6 RNA and protein
were detected after over-expressing HDAC1, but not
HDAC1 (H141A) (Figure 5C and 5D).
To test further that deacetylation of E2F1 by
HDAC1 increases SIRT6 transcription, 5637 and DU145
cells were treated with HDAC inhibitor, TSA. As shown
in Figure 6A, a dose dependent increase in acetylation of
E2F1 and histone 3 was acetylation were detected in 5637
and DU145 cells. This is associated with a dose-dependent
decrease in SIRT6 expression and SIRT6 promoter

activities (Figure 6A and 6B). TSA treatment, however,
had minimal effects on SIRT6 promoter activities when
the E2F1 binding site on the proximal SIRT6 promoter
was mutated. To test whether increased E2F1 acetylation
after TSA treatment enhances its binding to the SIRT6
promoter, Chip assay was performed with anti E2F1
pull down. Compared to the E2F1 levels on the SIRT6
promoter of untreated cells, higher levels of E2F1 on
the SIRT6 promoter were detected after TSA treatment
(Figure 6C). These data support further that HDAC1
deacetylates E2F1 and diminishes its negative regulation
of SIRT6 promoter.

DISCUSSION

glycolysis [22]. A highly glycolytic phenotype is also
recently reported in a metastatic prostate cancer mouse
model established with luciferase expressing PC3 cells
[23]. These published data based on in vivo models and
primary tumor samples support our in vitro finding that
E2F1 down regulates SIRT6 transcription and facilitates
aerobic glycolysis.
Despite SIRT6’s important roles in regulating
glycolysis, DNA repair and genome integrity, the upstream
regulation of SIRT6 expression and function has not been
well studied. A significant increase in E2F1 and decrease
in SIRT6 was observed within 24 hours of hypoxic
culture (Figure 3B). The decrease in SIRT6 expression
and function under hypoxia was significantly diminished
after knocking down E2F1 with siRNA (Figure 4D). More
importantly, our data showed that HDAC1 deacetylates
E2F1 and diminished its negative regulation of SIRT6
promoter and increased SIRT6 mRNA and protein
expressions. Based on the reported tumor suppressor role
of SIRT6, the decreased SIRT6 expression after treatment
with HDAC inhibitor, TSA, reflects the complexity of
developing HDAC inhibitor for cancer treatments (Figure
6). Our finding on the repression of SIRT6 transcription
by E2F1 will broaden the therapeutic opportunities
to enhance SIRT6 tumor suppressor activities with
compounds like CDK4/6 inhibitor, which retains E2F1 in
the RB-E2F1 complex by diminishing the phosphorylation
of RB by CDK4/6.

Utilizing prostate cancer and bladder cancer
cell lines, our data support our hypothesis that E2F1
suppresses SIRT6 transcription and facilities cancer cell
glycolysis. Unlike its well documented roles in regulating
cell-cycle progression, cell differentiation, DNA repair,
and apoptosis, the role of E2F1 in promoting cancer cell
aerobic glycolysis has not been reported before. Studies on
BAT and GNM of E2F1 -/- mice have reported that E2F1
inhibits oxidative metabolism and enhances glycolytic
metabolism [2]. E2F1 has also been shown to up-regulate
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) transcription
in C2C12 myoblasts and human cardiac AC16 cells [2021]. Like PDK4, PDK1 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase
activity, and facilities lactate production by diverting
pyruvate away from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
Based on the published data, PDK1 seems to play a
bigger role in regulating this process compared to its other
isoforms, particularly in cancer cells [17]. Our data showed
that E2F1 up-regulates the expression and function of key
glycolysis regulators like PDK1 and GLUT1 through
repressing the transcription of SIRT6, a master regulator
of glycolysis [3]. Although our data do not exclude the
possibility that E2F1 may directly regulate PDK1 and or
GLUT1, no standard E2F1 binding sites were identified
in the PDK1 and GLUT1 promoter regions. Furthermore
forced over-expression of SIRT6 can reverse the glucose
uptake and lactate production induced by E2F1 overexpression (Figure 1C), which indicates that repressing
SIRT6 is required in the regulation of glycolysis by E2F1.
Given several key proteins in the glycolysis pathway are
negatively regulated either directly or indirectly by SIRT6;
repressing SIRT6 transcription is a more effective way for
E2F1 to up regulate aerobic glycolysis compare to directly
activating individual glycolytic genes.
Bladder cancer and prostate cancer cells are chosen
for this study based on the oncogenic role of E2F1 reported
in these 2 malignancies [11-12]. In the case of bladder
cancer, an E2F1 gene expression signature has been
associated with muscle invasive bladder cancer and been
shown to predict progression of superficial bladder cancers
to the more aggressive muscle invasive bladder cancers
[12]. High E2F1 expression is associated with high levels
of GLUT1 and PDK1 in these bladder and prostate cancer
datasets [11, 12]. Given detecting under expressed genes
is not as robust as detecting over expressed gene with gene
expression array; we recently used immunohistochemistry
to study SIRT6 expression in muscle invasive bladder
cancers obtained through radical cystectomy [22].
Consistent with the down-regulation of SIRT6 by E2F1,
The expression of SRIT6 was significantly diminished
when bladder cancers invaded deeper, i.e. progressed
further on the tumor staging. Functional studies with
bladder cancer cell lines indicate that a major function
of SIRT6 in bladder cancer is to down-regulate aerobic

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell culture
Prostate cancer (PC3 and DU145) and bladder
cancer (5637 and UMUC3) cell lines were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
maintained in culture mediums as instructed by ATCC,
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin. For
hypoxia experiments, cells were incubated in a hypoxic
chamber (Biospherix) with constant 0.2% oxygen.

by real-time PCR. Input signal was treated as 100%
binding. Relative promoter occupancy was calculated by
comparing the cycle numbers between input (representing
1% of total lysate) and IP samples.

Immunoprecipitation

Transfection of siRNA

Cells were grown to about 70% confluency, then
washed twice with 1xPBS, and collected in CHAPS buffer
(25 mM HEPES, 2 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.3%
CHAPS). After 20 min of incubation on ice and 10 min of
centrifugation at 4°C, 500 μg of Lysates were pre-cleared
with 30 μl Protein A/G Agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 2h
and supernatants were collected. IPs were performed by
mixing supernatants with 3 μg of E2F1 (Santa Cruz) or
HDAC1 (Santa Cruz) antibodies or IgG (Abcam), together
with 30 μl of protein A/G Agarose beads, for overnight at
4°C. After 3 washes of PBS buffer, the immuno-complexes
were eluted by 10 min boiling in 2x SDS loading buffer.

SIRT6 siRNA pools were purchased from Santa
Cruz. E2F1 and HDAC1 siRNA Smartpools (4 target
specific siRNAs) were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells
were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 5μM
siRNAs. After 6 hours, the medium with siRNA was
removed and cells were incubated with fresh medium
1-2 days before further treatment. A mock siRNA
(Dharmacon) was used as control.

Transfection of plasmid

Real time RT-PCR assay

cDNA 3.1 Plasmid encoding E2F1 and its mutant
(E138) were kindly provided by Dr. Doug Cress. Cells
were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg
plasmids. After 6 hours, the medium with plasmid was
removed and cells were incubated with fresh medium
for two days. An empty vector (invitrogen) was used as
control.

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen); 2 μg total RNA was reversely transcribed
using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Sequences of SIRT6 primers were as
follows: 5”-CTTGGCACATTCCACAA-3” (forward)
and 5”-GCTTCCTGGTCAGCCAGA-3” (reverse).
Amplification reaction assays contained 1× SYBR green
PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystem) at the optimal
concentrations, and amplification was performed using
an ABI PRISM 7000 SDS thermal cycler (Applied
Biosystem). GADPH was used as the reference gene for
normalization.

Luciferase reporter gene assays
Promoter region of SIRT6 about 1.4kb was cloned
into PGL3 luciferase reporter vector. Cells were seeded in
96-well culture plates (Costar) and transfected with 2 ng/
well Renilla luciferase construct along with 0.2 μg/well of
each SIRT6 promoter firefly luciferase reporter construct
in triplicate. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were
measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit
(Promega).

Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) Analysis

Site-directed mutagenesis

ChIP experiments were performed following the
protocol of Chip-IT Express Kit (Active Motif). Briefly,
cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde and incubated
with 1X lysis buffer with a protease-inhibitor mixture,
and sonicated to generate 200-500bp DNA fragments.
After incubation with 5 μg of anti-E2F1 antibody (Santa
Cruz) or anti-HDAC1 antibody (Santa Cruz) and crosslinking reversal, bound DNA was obtained by phenol
chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and
resuspended in 50μl of H2O. PCR was performed with
5 μl of immunoprecipitated target DNA. Input material
corresponding to 1% of total sample was recovered prior
to inmunoprecipitation, and PCR was performed with 1
μl of purified DNA. Primer sets used were the following:
5´ -GGCTCTGTCCTTACGGAATTTA -3´(forward) and
5’ TCTTTGCATGCA GGTGTTTG -3’ (reverse). The
final immunoprecipitation (IP) products were monitored

Mutation on SIRT6 E2F1 binding consensus
was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the
QuikChange Kit from Stratagene according to previous
publication [18] and the pGL3 clones as template. E2F
binding consensus and mutated sequence on SIRT6
promoter region are in Figure 2C. The introduction of
mutations was confirmed by sequencing.

Glucose and lactate uptake assays
For glucose uptake assays, cells were grown
under normoxic or hypoxic condition for 24 hours and
150 μM 2-NBDG (Invitrogen) was added to the media.
Fluorescence was measured in a FACSCalibur Analyzer
