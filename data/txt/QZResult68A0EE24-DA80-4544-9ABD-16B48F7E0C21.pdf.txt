BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate predictors of early distant brain failure (DBF) and salvage whole-brain
radiotherapy (WBRT) after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases and create a clinically relevant risk
score to stratify patients’ risk for these events. METHODS: The records of 270 patients with brain metastases who were treated with
SRS between 2003 and 2012 were reviewed. Pretreatment patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed with univariate and
multivariate analyses. The cumulative incidences of first DBF and salvage WBRT were calculated. Significant factors were used to
create a score for stratifying early (6-month) DBF risk. RESULTS: No prior WBRT, a total lesion volume < 1.3 cm3, primary breast cancer or malignant melanoma histology, and multiple metastases (2) were found to be significant predictors of early DBF. Each factor
was ascribed 1 point because of similar hazard ratios. Scores of 0 to 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were considered to indicate low, intermediate,
and high risk, respectively. This correlated with 6-month cumulative incidences of DBF of 16.6%, 28.8%, and 54.4%, respectively
(P <.001). For patients without prior WBRT, the 6-month cumulative incidence of salvage WBRT was 2%, 17.7%, and 25.7%, respectively (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early DBF after SRS requiring salvage WBRT remains a significant clinical problem. Patient stratification for early DBF can better inform the decision for the initial treatment strategy for brain metastases. The provided risk score may
help to predict early DBF and subsequent salvage WBRT if SRS is initially used. External validation is needed before clinical impleC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Brain metastases are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the adult cancer population and occur in up to 30%
of patients.1 Traditionally, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has been the predominant treatment of choice for multiple
lesions and the predominant adjuvant therapy after surgical resection for a limited numbers of metastases. The use of
WBRT can provide rapid attenuation of neurologic symptoms and reduce the risk of neurologic death.2 However,
WBRT is associated with an increased risk of significant neurocognitive side effects, such as memory loss, as early as 4
months after treatment.3
The increasing use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) either alone or in combination with WBRT is supported by
several randomized trials.4-6 Because of the consistent lack of a survival benefit associated with the addition of WBRT as
well as its detrimental effects on quality of life and neurocognitive function,3,7 there has been a treatment paradigm shift
in favor of initial treatment with SRS alone. This strategy requires close surveillance and is associated with a significantly
increased risk of distant brain failure (DBF). Although most DBF events can be effectively salvaged with additional
SRS,8,9 WBRT is used as a salvage therapy in cases of multiple, large-volume, or extensive DBFs.
The ideal candidate for initial SRS not only would have a limited number of brain metastases, low-volume extracranial disease, and a good performance status but also would have a low risk of early DBF that would necessitate salvage

WBRT. Patients who require short-interval salvage
WBRT are less likely to experience the neurocognitive
benefit of SRS alone, and this results in two successive
modalities of cranial radiotherapy. Alternatively, patients
at low risk for DBF have a higher likelihood of their
disease being controlled with SRS alone, and they would
be expected to maintain a higher quality of life because
the time to WBRT would be prolonged.7 To maximize
the benefits of each modality, it is necessary to improve
the stratification of patients according to the risk of early
DBF. The purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative risk stratification score to predict the risk of shortinterval (6-month) DBF and salvage WBRT using
pretreatment clinical patient and tumor characteristics for
patients with brain metastases treated with SRS alone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this
study. We reviewed the medical records of consecutive
patients treated with single-fraction linear accelerator
(LINAC)–based framed SRS alone between January 2003
and June 2012. Additional eligibility criteria included an
age of at least 18 years, a pathologic diagnosis of cancer,
radiographic evidence of at least 1 brain metastasis (if an
intact lesion), primary SRS or postoperative SRS to the
resection cavity, and at least 4 months of imaging followup. Patients were excluded if they had classically radiosensitive histologies (eg, lymphoma or germ cell tumors),
they had previously undergone cranial SRS, or a combination of WBRT and SRS therapy was planned for the current brain lesion or lesions. Prior WBRT was allowed to
determine the effect of previous WBRT on the subsequent
DBF risk after initial DBF. This left 270 patients with
480 individual lesions eligible for analysis.
Radiation Therapy

Details of SRS planning and delivery have been previously
published.10 In brief, patients were treated with singlefraction LINAC–based framed SRS, and their treatment
was planned with either BrainScan or iPlan treatmentplanning software (BrainLab, Feldkirchen, Germany). All
patients underwent a high-resolution treatment-planning
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with and without contrast before computed tomography simulation.
The treatment-planning MRI scan was registered to the
computed tomography simulation with BrainLab software. The gross target volume was defined as the entire
enhancing lesion or resection cavity, including any residual enhancing disease. The gross target volume was then
Cancer

November 1, 2015

expanded from 0 to 2 mm in all directions to create a
planning target volume. Typical expansions were 1 mm to
the planning target volume for intact lesions and a 1-mm
clinical target volume and 1-mm planning target volume
expansion (for a total of 2 mm) for resection cavities. The
prescribed dose varied according to the lesion size and was
consistent with the findings of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 90-05.11 Targets up to 20 mm in
diameter were typically dosed to 21 Gy, targets that were
21 to 30 mm in diameter were dosed to 18 Gy, and targets
that were 31 to 40 mm in diameter were dosed to 15 Gy.
Follow-Up and Assessment of Progression

Follow-up with MRI occurred 1 month after treatment
and then every 3 months thereafter unless it was clinically
indicated at an earlier time point. DBF was defined as the
occurrence of at least 1 new enhancing intracranial metastatic lesion outside the 80% isodose line of the previously
treated lesion or lesions. Cases for which imaging was
equivocal between local tumor progression and radiation
necrosis were adjudicated by the consensus of the multidisciplinary brain tumor board. When it was necessary,
advanced techniques, including MRI single-photon emission computed tomography, MRI perfusion, brain positron emission tomography, and/or surgical resection,
were used to differentiate radiographic changes. Patients
who had a limited number of DBF lesions or had received
WBRT previously were first considered for salvage with
local therapy (generally SRS). Salvage WBRT was used
for patients with diffuse brain metastases or a significant
number of brain metastases not amenable to local therapy.
This decision was left to the discretion of the treating physician and the patient.
Statistical Analysis

The primary outcomes for this analysis included 1) the
time to first DBF from the first SRS treatment session and
2) the time to salvage WBRT from the first SRS session
for patients without previous WBRT. DBF within 6
months of first SRS was deemed an early event on the basis of clinical experience before the analysis, and this was
the main time point of interest. Pretreatment patient and
tumor characteristics were analyzed with respect to these
outcomes to stratify the risk as low, intermediate, and
high and to generate a clinically usable score for risk stratification. Secondary outcomes included overall survival
(OS), which was the time to death from any cause after
the first SRS session.
The statistical analysis was conducted with SAS 9.3
and R 2.15.3. A competing risk analysis was conducted,
3837

Original Article

and the cumulative incidence was estimated for DBF and
WBRT. For both, death without the event of interest was
considered a competing risk. For the analysis of DBF, if
patients did not experience DBF or death, they were censored at the time of last brain imaging or salvage WBRT.
For the analysis of WBRT, only patients without previous
WBRT were included, and patients without WBRT or
death were censored at the time of last brain imaging. OS
rates were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method.
To determine which factors should be incorporated
into a DBF risk score, a multivariate competing risk analysis was conducted with a proportional subdistribution
hazards regression model as described by Fine and
Gray.12,13 The following variables were considered: sex,
primary cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status, active systemic disease, extracranial
metastatic sites, previous WBRT, number of lesions
treated, age at treatment, and total volume of lesions (centimeters cubed). Continuous variables were categorized
with quintiles, and all categorical variables were dummycoded. Best subset selection was used to choose the final
set of variables. The number of parameters to include in
the final model was determined on the basis of 10-fold
cross-validation.14 To measure model performance, a
cause-specific concordance index (c-index) for competing
risk models was used; it was measured at the time point of
interest, 6 months.15 The smallest number of parameters
with a cross-validated performance estimate within 1
standard error of the best model was chosen.14 Once the
number of parameters to include in the model was chosen,
best subset selection was run for the full sample.
To create DBF risk scores, parameter estimates from
the resulting model were divided by the natural log of 2.
In this way, each 1-point increase in the risk score could
be interpreted as a 2-fold increase in the risk of DBF. To
simplify the scoring system, points were rounded to the
nearest integer because this did not make a substantial difference in the results. To assess the association of the DBF
risk groups with the outcomes, both cumulative incidence
functions with Gray’s test and univariate proportional
subdistribution hazards regression models were used. The
bootstrap cross-validation c-index was reported at 6
months.
RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics

Two hundred seventy patients with a total of 480 brain
metastases were eligible for analysis; the median imaging
follow-up period was 26.2 months (range, 4-112 months)
3838

for patients without DBF, WBRT, or death. Non–small
cell lung cancer (37%), breast cancer (23%), and malignant melanoma (21%) were the most common primary
histologies. Eighty-five patients (31%) had received
previous WBRT, and the median dose was 35 Gy (range,
24-45 Gy).
All patients underwent single-fraction LINAC–
based SRS. Most patients (59%) had a single brain metastasis, with 61 patients (23%) treated for 2 lesions and with
49 patients (18%) treated for 3 lesions (see Table 1 for
additional patient and treatment characteristics).
Recurrence and Salvage WBRT Use

The 6- and 12-month cumulative incidences of DBF for all
270 patients were 30.6% (95% confidence interval [CI],
25.2%-36.2%) and 46.2% (95% CI, 40.1%-52.1%),
respectively (Fig. 1). DBF occurred in 164 patients. Ninetyone (55%) were salvaged with SRS, 42 (26%) were salvaged
with WBRT, 21 (13%) received no therapy, 8 (5%) were
salvaged with surgery, and 2 (1%) were salvaged with fractionated partial brain radiation.
The 6- and 12-month cumulative incidences of salvage WBRT for the 185 patients without previous
WBRT were 15.3% (95% CI, 10.5%-20.9%) and 24.2%
(95% CI, 18.2%-30.6%), respectively (Supporting Fig. 1
[see online supporting information]). The 6- and
12-month cumulative incidences of DBF in this cohort
were 33.9% (95% CI, 27.1%-40.8%) and 48.6% (95%
CI, 41%-55.6%), respectively.
In the multivariate analysis of prognostic factors, the
following parameters were found to be significant predictors of increased risk of DBF: no previous WBRT
(P 5 .025), a total volume of treated lesions < 0.3 cm3
(P 5 .007), a total volume of treated lesions of 0.3 to
< 1.3 cm3 (P 5 .034), a total number of lesions
treated  2 (P 5 .012), and breast cancer (P < .001) or
malignant melanoma histology (P 5 .015; Table 2).
To calculate the DBF risk score, 1 point was added
for each of the following risk factors: no previous WBRT,
total lesion volume for initial SRS < 1.3 cm3, primary
breast cancer or malignant melanoma, and multiple
lesions (2) treated with SRS. The score was calculated
for the 256 patients (95%) with complete data available.
The resulting scores ranged from 0 to 4. Both the lowest
and highest scores occurred infrequently (<5.1%). Consequently, scores of 0 and 1 were grouped together into
the low-risk group. A score of 2 was considered to indicate
intermediate risk, and a score of 3 or 4 was considered to
indicate high risk (Table 3). Ninety-one patients (36%)

dence of DBF for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk
groups was 16.6% (95% CI, 9.8%-25.1%), 28.8% (95%
CI, 20.2%-38.1%), and 54.4% (95% CI, 41.4%-65.6%),
respectively (P < .001; Fig. 2). The hazard ratios (HRs) for
the high- and intermediate-risk groups versus the low-risk
group were 3.04 (95% CI, 2.01-4.61; P < .001) and 1.64
(95% CI, 1.11-2.44; P 5 .013), respectively. The c-index
for this model was 0.657 (Supporting Table 1 [see online
supporting information]).
These risk groups were assessed with respect to the endpoint of salvage WBRT use in the 179 patients without previous WBRT and the necessary data available to calculate the
score. Fifty-two patients (29%) were low-risk, 68 (38%)
were intermediate-risk, and 59 (33%) were high-risk. The
6-month cumulative incidence of salvage WBRT for the
low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups was 2% (95% CI,
0.2%-9.2%), 17.7% (95% CI, 9.7%-27.7%), and 25.7%
(95% CI, 15.2%-37.4%), respectively (P < .001; Fig. 3).
The hazard of salvage WBRT for the high-risk group was 4
times the hazard for the low-risk group (HR, 4.15; 95% CI,
2.03-8.48; P < .001), and the hazard for the intermediaterisk group was twice that for the low-risk group (HR, 2.28;
95% CI, 1.08-4.81; P 5 .03). The c-index of this model,
measured at 6 months, was 0.673 (Supporting Table 2
[see online supporting information]).
Survival

The median OS for all patients was 17.8 months (95% CI,
15.6-21.1 months) with a 1-year OS rate of 66.6%. The
OS rates did not differ significantly between risk groups
(P 5 .84; Supporting Fig. 2 [see online supporting information]). Notably, a DBF event and male sex were significantly
associated with worse OS in the multivariate analysis,
3839

Original Article

whereas an absence of active systemic disease was protective
(Supporting Table 3 [see online supporting information]).
DISCUSSION
There is significant controversy concerning the use and
timing of WBRT and/or SRS for the management of
brain metastases. For patients with 1 to 4 lesions and a reasonable expectation of systemic control, therapy options
include surgical resection followed by radiation therapy,
WBRT plus SRS for a single metastasis, SRS alone, or
WBRT alone. For patients with >4 lesions, WBRT is
generally preferred; however, additional consideration of
SRS may be made for patients with a good performance
status and a low overall tumor volume.16
To better define the standard of care, there have
been several investigations into risk stratification of DBF
after SRS.17-22 Sawrie et al17 (2008) retrospectively investigated a cohort of 100 patients with newly diagnosed
brain metastases, and they revealed >3 metastases, the
presence of extracranial metastases, and melanoma histology as significant predictors of DBF. The rate of 1-year
freedom from DBF for patients without any risk factors
was 83%, whereas it was 26% for all others. The limitaTABLE 2. Multivariate Competing Risk Analysis of

tions of this study included the small number of patients,
the lack of a reported median imaging follow-up period,
substantially higher rates of DBF in comparison with
other similar published reports, and the lack of a competing risk analysis for the 1-year endpoint.
Rodrigues et al22 (2014) published the results of 361
patients treated with LINAC-based SRS for oligometastatic disease to the brain. They designed a recursive partitioning analysis that stratified patients on the basis of the
risk for DBF at 1 year. Significant factors included age,
number of lesions, maximum gross tumor volume, and
performance status. Our study confirmed several of their
findings, including the prognostic value of the number of
lesions, the histology, and a smaller total tumor volume.
Although clinically useful, this study did not relate the
risk of DBF to the need for salvage WBRT.
Ayala-Peacock et al21 (2014) reviewed 464 patients
without prior WBRT who were treated with Gamma Knife.
The study designed a nomogram for predicting DBF at 6
and 9 months and examined the time to salvage WBRT.
Significant predictors of DBF included progressive systemic
disease, the number of metastases, the discovery of new metastases at the time of the SRS planning scan, and melanoma
and squamous cell lung cancer histologies. The earlier
requirement of WBRT was significantly predicted by progressive systemic disease, the number of brain metastases,
the minimum SRS dose, and widespread metastatic disease.
Our study confirmed several of these predictive factors,
including the number of metastases and high-risk primary
histologies. Lesion volume was not included in their analysis. Differences between the studies include our use of cumulative incidence analysis with a competing risk versus the
Kaplan-Meier method, which minimizes the risk of overestimation when there is substantial hazard for the competing
risk. We expanded on the time to salvage WBRT by applying our scoring system toward this endpoint and demonstrated significant and clinically relevant stratification.

Figure 2. Cumulative incidence of distant brain failure by risk
groups.

The absence of prior WBRT significantly increased
the risk of subsequent DBF in this study. We included
patients with prior WBRT to determine and quantify
whether there was a persistent effect on subsequent DBF
even after an initial DBF event. Our study shows that
WBRT does have a protective effect on subsequent DBF
after initial DBF. We hypothesize that WBRT may effectively control the vast majority of microscopic disease in
the brain, but there may be a small resistant population
that manifests as DBF without being the product of systemic reseeding of the central nervous system (CNS). Subsequent local therapy with SRS would then sterilize this
resistant population.
It is known from multiple phase 3 randomized trials
that the omission of WBRT after local therapy (surgery or
SRS) for brain metastases leads to higher intracranial failure rates but without detriment for OS.3,4,6,23 However,
in this study, a DBF event was associated with worse OS
in the multivariate analysis. This discrepancy is likely due
to the fact that our study patient population was significantly higher risk in terms of both CNS and non-CNS
progression than the phase 3 trial study populations. A
higher proportion of patients (20%) had melanoma histology, a significant proportion of patients (18%) had 3
brain metastases treated, and patients with previous
WBRT were included; this meant that a DBF event in
that subset was actually a second brain relapse event. All of
these factors served to increase the mortality risk of DBF
in comparison with the published trials. Although most
patients did receive salvage therapy for DBF, 13% did
not, and this may have also contributed to the increased
risk of death with DBF.

Interestingly, smaller cumulative volumes of metastases predicted a greater risk of DBF. This result reinforces
a similar finding by Rodrigues et al22 (2014), who
reported that a smaller gross target volume was related to a
greater DBF risk at 1 year. A higher risk of DBF for
patients with smaller metastases may theoretically be indicative of primaries with a greater propensity to seed
micrometastases. In addition, small lesions may have the
potential to be missed by initial MRI and manifest as the
early development of multiple small foci.
Initial SRS with observation versus SRS with
WBRT for patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases has been
reported to result in improved neurocognitive outcomes
and acceptable cost-effectiveness in quality-adjusted lifeyears/expectancy without a difference in OS.24,25 Despite
a decrease in the risk of DBF with WBRT, the associated
reduction in quality of life makes this risk and the subsequent cost of salvage therapies justifiable for this particular
population.7 Although initial WBRT has been losing
popularity, it is still a useful and acceptable standard of
care in the setting of multiple initial brain metastases and
may be considered for a patient with a high risk of early
DBF and salvage WBRT.
In addition, several recent advances, including the
use of neuroprotectant drugs and hippocampal avoidance
techniques, have been made that significantly reduce the
neurocognitive detriment of traditional WBRT.26,27
Alternatively, the inclusion of CNS active systemic therapies could be emphasized if initial SRS were used to
reduce the risk of early DBF. Several biologic and immunologic agents have shown CNS activity in patients with
brain metastases; they include erlotinib in lung cancer,28
3841

Original Article

lapatinib and capecitabine in human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2–positive breast cancer,29 and dabrafenib
and ipilimumab in malignant melanoma.30,31 Although
initial or salvage SRS of large numbers of brain metastases
is technically feasible,32 whether the neurocognitive preservation benefits of SRS apply when so many lesions are
treated is not yet known.
The strengths of this study include its large patient
population, homogeneous treatment paradigm and salvage WBRT indications, long median imaging follow-up
period, and use of competing risk analyses. The primary
limitation of the risk score is its unproven nature. To be
fully incorporated into practice, it will require further validation in independent cohorts. Other limitations of this
study include its retrospective nature, single-institution
experience, extended treatment period, and lack of neurocognitive and quality-of-life metrics. The last 2 factors are
critical for choosing between local and regional brain
radiotherapy and are areas of active research.
In conclusion, early DBF after SRS requiring salvage
WBRT remains a significant clinical problem. Patient
stratification for early DBF can better inform the decision
for the initial treatment strategy for brain metastases. No
prior WBRT, a total lesion volume treated with
SRS < 1.3 cm3, primary breast cancer or malignant melanoma histology, and multiple lesions (2) are associated
with an increased risk of early (6-month) DBF.
