ABSTRACT
The efficacy of available lung cancer therapeutic interference is significantly
limited by various resistance mechanisms to those drugs. Activation of the oncogene
YAP underlying the initiation, progression, and metastasis of lung cancer associates
with poor prognosis and confers drug resistance against targeted therapy. In this
study, we evaluated the specificity of norcantharidin (NCTD) in repressing YAP to
inhibit non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) progression. Our study revealed that
YAP signal pathways were aberrantly activated in lung cancer tissues and cells which
rendered more proliferative and invasive phenotypes to human lung cancer cells.
We confirmed that NCTD specifically repressed YAP signaling pathway to interfere
the YAP-mediated non-small cell lung carcinoma progression and metastasis via
arresting cell cycle, enhancing apoptosis and inducing senescence. We also found
NCTD-mediated repression of YAP decreased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and reduced the motile and invasive cellular phenotype in vitro via enhancing
E-cadherin and decreasing fibronectin/vimentin. Mechanistic investigations revealed
that NCTD transcriptionally downregulated YAP and post-translationally modulated
the subcellular redistribution of YAP between nucleus and cytoplasm. Collectively,
our results indicated that NCTD is a novel therapeutic drug candidate for NSCLC which
specifically and sensitively target YAP signal pathway.

INTRODUCTION

negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor Mst in this
kinase cascade transcriptionally activates its downstream
target genes involved in cell growth and survival
[17–21]. The upstream signal molecules phosphorylate
and activate Mst, one of the core suppressor components
inside the hippo pathway. Sav (WW-45) is another core
component of the Mst tumor suppressor pathway, offering
assistance of the activated Mst kinase phosphorylates and
activates Lats, which itself phosphorylates Yap with the
involvement of the Mob. Phosphorylated Yap is retained
in the cytoplasm by interacting with 14-3-3 protein,
so cannot combine with its target transcription factors
to interact with promoters, and is thereby inactivated
[19–25]. However, in the case of the loss of function
of the Mst cell signals, the unphosphorylated Yap gets
into the nucleus and physically binds to the transcription
factors TEAD family proteins, which itself regulates the
target genes of the Mst/Yap pathway such as connective

As the number one cancer killer worldwide
[1–6] and with enormous efforts in surveillance, surgery,
radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy, lung
cancer still remains the most aggressive malignant tumor
with one of the lowest survival rates [7, 8, 9]. The new
approaches to detect, cure, and prevent this malignant
disease are currently in emergent demands.
One of critical challenges for targeted lung cancer
chemotherapies is rapid and unavoidable drug resistance
development. Aberrant activation Mst/Yap pathways

and so on [25–31].
Norcantharidin (NCTD) has been applied in cancer
treatment in China for years. NCTD is a demethylated
form of cantharidin that has an important anticancer role in
breast cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, prostate
cancer, mantle cell lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma,
leukemia, and colon cancer with fewer side effects
[32–37]. NCTD has been found to induce both in vitro and
in vivo inhibitions in growth of a variety of human tumor
cells via modulating functions of cell cycle kinases leading
to tumor cell cycle arrests. NCTD also can activate the
mitochondrial pathway and ROS accumulation to induce
tumor cell apoptosis [38–39] and significantly reduce the
tumor angiogenesis [40–42] However, the underlying
mechanisms by which NCTD inhibits lung cancer
progression and metastasis are still largely undefined.
This study examined the specificity of NCTD in
repressing YAP to inhibit non-small cell lung carcinoma
progression and revealed that NCTD inhibits cell growth
and metastasis, enhances s cell apoptosis and senescence,
and arrest cell cycle in lung cancer cells via specifically
downregulating aberrantly activated YAP signaling. Our
results suggested that NCTD is a novel therapeutic drug
candidate for NSCLC which specifically and sensitively
target YAP signal pathway.

cells. Knockdown of YAP increased E-cadherin protein
and mRNA levels and decreased the protein level of
vimentin in A549 cells (Figure 2A, 2B). Depletion of YAP
also significantly decreased clonal formation (Figure 2C)
and cell migration (Figure 2D) of A549 cells, which
indicates the critical role of YAP in invasive growth of
NSCLC cells.

NCTD represses the activity of YAP in the lung
cancer cells
Norcantharidin (NCTD) was further mechanistically
explored in its interfering YAP signal pathways in lung
cancer cells. NCTD at 8 μM for 36 h decreased YAP in
nuclear and enriched phoshorylated YAP inside cytoplasm
leading to the translocation of Yap from nuclear to
cytoplasm in A549 cells (Figure 3A, 3B). We also found
that NCTD dose-dependently (Figure 3C, 3D, 3G) and
time-dependently (Figure 3E, 3F) reduced Yap mRNA
and protein level, but increased phosphorylated YAP in
A549 cells and H1299 cells (Supplementary Figure S1).
Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis indicates that
the protein level of Yap was obvious reduced in A549
cells treated with 15 μM NCTD for 72 h (Supplementary
Figure S2A). Since NCTD induced repression of YAP
in NSCLC cells, we further examined the effect of
NCTD on YAP downstream signaling pathway. Both
RT-PCR and immunoblotting showed NCTD inhibited
YAP and then consequently decreased YAP downstream
targets CYR61 and CTGF at both mRNA (Figure 3G)
and protein (Figure 3H) levels from 4 µM to 16 µM in
A549 cells for 72 hours in dose-dependent manner.
Additive immunofluorescent staining of those YAP
downstream targets semi-quantitatively demonstrated
that NCTD at 4 µM and 16 µM for 72 hours significantly
decreased both CTGF (Supplementary Figure S2B) and
CYR61(Supplementary Figure S2C) protein level in A549
cells.

RESULTS
Aberrant activation of YAP in lung cancer
specimens
For examination of the expression of YAP in human
lung tumor tissues, we performed both RT-PCR and
immunoblotting and found that mRNA levels of Yap were
higher in lung tumor tissues compared with their adjacent
normal lung tissues in four pairs of specimens (Figure 1A).
As indicated in Figure 1B, the total YAP protein levels
were also significantly elevated in all four lung tumor
tissue compared to their adjacent normal lung tissues.
Meanwhile, the phosphorylated Yap (cytoplasm part) was
lower in these lung tumor samples than these adjacent
normal lung tissues. Immunofluorescent staining of Yap
proteins further showed more accumulated YAP in nuclear
of NSCLC samples relative to their normal adjacent lung
tissues while more p-YAP was localized in cytoplasm
of those normal adjacent lung tissues (Figure 1C, 1D).
Endogenous Yap protein level was also significantly
higher in Calu-6, H1299, and A549 cells than normal cell
line (Figure 1E).

NCTD interferes the YAP-mediated NSCLC cell
proliferation
To investigate the potential biological function of
NCTD in NSCLC cells, our examination of cell cycle
profile in lung cancer cells treated with NCTD revealed
that treatment of NCTD at15 μM for 72 h induced
significant G2 arrests in A549 cells and dramatically
blocked the YAP-induced S introduction as showed in both
representative histograms of cell cycle distribution and
their quantitation analysis (Figure 4A). As in Figure 4B,
4C, in vitro proliferation assay demonstrated that ectopic
expression of YAP, or its variant YAPS127A, or YAP
plus its downstream component TEAD significantly
stimulated A549 and H1299 cells in growth and NCTD
at 15 µM time-dependently and significantly arrested
the proliferation rates of A549 and H1299 cells with or

plus TEAD at least partially blocked NCTD-induced
apoptosis (Figure 5B). Additional immunoblotting
confirmed that NCTD dose-dependently increased proapoptosis protein caspase-3 in A549 and H1299 cells for
72 hours (Figure 5C).

Our results confirmed that NCTD treatment significantly
arrested the proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells in
dose- and time-dependent manners via dose-dependent
repression of activities of YAP and its downstream target
genes, which eventually leads to the cell cycle arrests in
lung cancer cells. In addition, NCTD induced dramatic
reduction in invasive growth of A549 cells implying its
potentials in targeting lung cancer metastasis. Our findings
strongly support the development and application of
NCTD as a novel therapeutic option in the treatment of
human lung cancer.
The efficacy of available lung cancer therapeutic
interference is significantly limited by various resistance
mechanisms to those drugs. YAP is one of the novel
anti-cancer drug targets involved in chemo-resistance in
lung cancer. Activation of the oncogene YAP underlying
the initiation, progression, and metastasis of lung cancer
associates with poor prognosis and may promote metastatic
spread and confer drug resistance against targeted therapy.
Given the selective induction of tumor cell apoptosis
by NCTD without affecting normal cells [24–26] and
highly activation of YAP in lung cancer, it is reasonable
to test the therapeutic efficacy of NCTD in human lung
cancer treatment and its specificity derived from the
selective YAP targeting. Our study revealed that YAP
signal pathways were aberrantly activated in lung cancer
tissues and cells which conferred more proliferative
and invasive phenotypes to human lung cancer cells.
We confirmed that NCTD specifically repressed YAP
signaling pathway to interfere the YAP-mediated NSCLC
progression and metastasis via arresting cell cycle,
apoptosis and senescence. We also found NCTD-mediated
repression of YAP decreased epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and reduced the motile and invasive
cellular phenotype and the metastatic prowess in vitro via
enhancing E-Cadherin and decreasing fibronectin/vimentin.
Given lacking extensive molecular dissection of
mechanisms governing downregulation of YAP by NCTD,
we further examined the NCTD-induced alterations in YAP
expression (mRNA and protein) and post-translational
modification (phosphorylation) in lung cancer cells. Our
results indicated that NCTD not only significantly and
selectively represses transcriptional activity of YAP, it
also enhances the phosphorylation of YAP to facilitate
the cytosol translocation of YAP from nuclear in lung
cancer cells (Figure 3A, 3B). We first found that NCTD
dose-dependently (Figure 3C, 3D) and time-dependently
(Figure 3E, 3F) reduced Yap mRNA and protein level,
but increased phosphorylated YAP in A549 cells, which
may suggest the rationale for the molecular mechanism in
NCTD’s non-resistance therapeutic function for lung cancer.
While our results characterized the anti-cancer
functions of NCTD in preventing NSCLC progression and
metastasis, we have not defined the role of NCTD in the
unavoidable chemoresistance development in lung cancer
treatment. Aberrantly activated YAP not only renders

NCTD interferes the Yap-mediated NSCLC cell
invasiveness and EMT
Cellular invasiveness are the most distinguished
features of tumor cells. In scratch assay (Figure 6A), we
found that treatment of NCTD at 15 µM for 12–24 hours
dramatically decreased Yap-induced enhancement in A549
cell migration. For examining invasive growth of those
lung tumor cells, the matrigel invasion assay identified that
treatment of NCTD at 15 µM for 72 hours dramatically
decreased cell invasive growth and overexpressing
YAP partially blocked NCTD-induced inhibition in cell
invasive growth (Figure 6B).
Since NCTD can inhibit the Yap-mediated invasive
growth of lung cancer cells, we further checked whether
NCTD interferes the YAP-mediated cellular phenotype
switching in lung cancer cells by examining the EMT hall
marks such as E-cadherin, Vimentin and Fibronectin. As
in Figure (6C, 6D), NCTD dose-dependently enhanced
E-cadherin and represses fibronectin as well as vimentin in
mRNA(Figure 6C) and protein (Figure 6D) level in A549
cells for 72 hours, which suggested that NCTD interferes
the YAP-mediated EMT in NSCLC cells.

DISCUSSION
Our study explored the specificity and efficacy of
norcantharidin (NCTD) in inhibiting NSCLC progression
and defined it as a novel therapeutic drug candidate for
NSCLC which specifically and sensitively target YAP
signal pathway.
Although substantial improvements in therapeutic
interference and early diagnosis of lung cancer have
increased survival ability and life qualities of lung
cancer patients over recent decades, it still remains the
most aggressive malignant tumor with one of the lowest
survival rates. To date, almost all NSCLC patients with
advanced and unresectable disease have few choices in
treatments except chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which
bring uncontrollable side effects. Therefore, it is in great
demands now to identify and characterize novel selective
drug candidates with none or low toxicities in lung cancer
therapies.
The potential of NCTD in cancer treatment was
explored as early in 1980s in China [5]. NCTD not only
can inhibit the proliferation of varieties of cancer cell
lines and those in vivo xenografts but also present no side
effects both in vitro and in vivo [24, 25]. Applying NCTD
as a monotherapeutic drug in clinical trials substantially
benefited patients with different human malignancies [6.7].

Collectively, NCTD can function as an efficient
non-resistance therapeutic drug for NSCLC patients via
inhibiting the activation of YAP to increase the apoptosis
and senescence, and arresting tumor cell proliferation.
Notable, we demonstrated that these effects of NCTD
were repressed by transient transfection of Yap. This study
verified and proposed that NCTD has all the potentials
to be selected as a chemotherapeutic candidate for
repressing tumorigenesis and the development of NSCLC
via selectively targeting YAP. NCTD interrupted the cell
cycle progression and rewired cell proportion distribution
among all the cell cycle phases leading to the cell growth
arrest in NSCLC cells. Finally, exceptional growth and
metastasis inhibition by NCTD in our study grants any
further clinical investigation regarding its anti-tumor
effects in NSCLC patients.

cells were grown on coverslips in a 24-well plate overnight
and after 24h, treated with NCTD. After 36 h, cells were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized
by incubation in 3% BSA in PBS for 30 min. The
coverslips were subsequently incubated with rabbit antiYap (CST, #8418), Cyr61(Abcam, 24448) and CTGF

was
determined
by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay in 96-well plates, as previously
described. Cells were incubated with 15 µM NCTD and
indicated plasmids for 72 h followed by MTT for 4 h, and
then 100 μL DMSO (Dimethyl Sulphoxide) was added to
dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was read at
570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Synergy H1, BioTek).
Cell viability was calculated as the relative absorbance
compared to DMSO vehicle control absorbance.

Wound-healing assay

Novelty and impact

Cells were plated in 6-well culture plate and incubated
in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24 h. Single layer confluent cells
were wounded by scraping using 200P micropipette tip, then
washed by PBS and incubated in RPMI containing 2% FBS
with various 15 µg/ml of NCTD and relevant plasmid for
different times. The result of this experiment was analyzed
by the Olympus light microscope.

This studies are the first to examine specific
targeting YAP signaling by NCTD in human lung cancer
treatment, and clearly suggest that activation of the
oncogene YAP is involved in the initiation, progression,
metastasis, and drug resistance against targeted therapy of
lung cancer and can be significantly repressed by NCTD
as monotherapeutic agent. Our studies provide a direct
mechanistic link between NCTD and its molecular targets
in YAP signal pathways in lung cancer therapy.

Transwell migration assay
Transwell migration assay was carried out with a
24-well chamber (Costar 3422, Corning Inc., Corning,
NY). The lower and upper chambers were separated by
a polycarbonate membrane (8 μm pore size). Cells (1 ×
105) were resuspended in RPMI medium containing free
FBS in the upper chamber. The RPMI medium containing
10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. A549 cells
were allowed to migrate for 36 h at 37˚C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The membrane was fixed
in methanol for 20 min at 4˚C, and then stained with
crystal violet. Cells on the upper side of the membrane
were removed by PBS-rinsed cotton swabs. Cells on
the lower side of the membrane were counted under an
Olympus light microscope.
