BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of linifanib (ABT-869), a selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor and plateletderived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, were assessed in this phase 2, single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial. METHODS: Eligible patients had unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and had received  1 prior systemic therapy. Patients
received oral linifanib at a fasting dose of 0.25 mg/kg,. The primary endpoint was the progression-free rate at 16 weeks. Tumor
response was assessed every 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints included the time to disease progression, overall survival, and objective
response rate. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients enrolled, the majority were Asian (89%), had received no prior
systemic therapy (82%), had Child-Pugh class A hepatic function (86%), and had hepatitis B virus infection (61%). The estimated progression-free rate at 16 weeks was 31.8% (34.2% for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function), the estimated objective
response rate was 9.1% (10.5% for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function), the median time to disease progression was 3.7
months (3.7 months for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function), and the median overall survival was 9.7 months (10.4
months for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function). The most common linifanib-related adverse events were diarrhea
(55%) and fatigue (52%). The most common linifanib-related grade 3/4 adverse events were hypertension (25%) and fatigue (14%).
Serum levels of biomarkers cancer antigen (CA) 125, cytokeratin fragment (CYFRA)21.1, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or
antagonist II (PIVKA) demonstrated potential as prognostic indicators of patient response or outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent
linifanib was found to be clinically active in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, with an acceptable safety profile.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has the third highest worldwide mortality of any malignancy.1 Approximately 70% to 85%
of patients with HCC have advanced or unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis.1 HCC is a highly vascularized tumor characterized by overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which correlates with poor prognosis.2-4 Plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor also play important roles in liver fibrosis and the growth of HCC.3
Sorafenib, a multitargeted kinase inhibitor selective for VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-related and PDGF receptor
(PDGFR)-related tyrosine kinases, has activity in a variety of preclinical tumor models, including HCC.2,4,5 Based on
phase 2 and landmark phase 3 trials,6-8 sorafenib is the only agent approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable
HCC.9
There is growing interest in novel agents with broad effectiveness in the treatment of advanced HCC. The VEGFR
and PDGFR selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib demonstrated modest activity in two phase 2 trials in patients
with advanced HCC (objective response rates [ORR] of 2.7% -2.9%)10-12; however, a phase 3 trial of sunitinib versus sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC was terminated in April 2010.13
The novel competitive inhibitor linifanib (ABT-869) has VEGFR and PDGFR selectivity and minimal activity
against unrelated tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases.14-17 Preclinical studies demonstrated potent inhibition of HCC
xenografts by linifanib, both as monotherapy and in combination with rapamycin.18 Evidence of specific antitumor

activity as a single agent was observed in a phase 1 study in
patients with refractory solid malignancies.17 Stable disease was maintained in 2 of the 4 patients with advanced
HCC through 3 months and 12 months, respectively.
Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 hypertension, fatigue, and proteinuria. Continuous dosing of linifanib at
a dose of 0.25 mg/kg once daily was recommended for
phase 2 studies. The efficacy and safety of linifanib in
patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC were
assessed in the current phase 2 study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The single-arm, open-label, multinational phase 2 study
protocol was approved by independent ethics committees
and/or the institutional review boards of the participating
institutions. The study was conducted according to all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines governing clinical study conduct. All patients provided written informed
consent (trial registration number is NCT00517920
[ClinicalTrials.gov]).
Eligible patients were adults with unresectable or
metastatic HCC (according to histologic or cytologic diagnosis or European Association for the Study of the Liver
[EASL] criteria19);  1 nonirradiated measurable lesion
according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors (RECIST)20;  1 prior line of systemic treatment
for HCC; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 2; and adequate bone
marrow (platelet count  50  109/L with splenomegaly
or  75  109/L without splenomegaly), renal (creatinine
 1.5  the upper limit of normal), and hepatic (total bilirubin  3.0 mg/dL) function. Exclusion criteria included
anticancer therapy within 21 days or 5 half-lives before
the administration of linifanib; treatment with a VEGFRtargeted, PDGFR-targeted, or tyrosine kinase-targeted
agent; untreated brain or meningeal metastases; ChildPugh class C hepatic impairment; proteinuria > grade
121; and uncontrolled hypertension.
Linifanib at a fasting dose of 0.25 mg/kg was administered at bedtime: daily to patients with Child-Pugh class
A hepatic function and every other day to patients with
Child-Pugh class B hepatic function to avoid potential
increases in systemic drug exposure due to impaired metabolism. Patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function received the recommended phase 2 dose.17 Patients
with Child-Pugh class B hepatic function were dosed every other day because safety in patients with hepatic
impairment was unknown at the time the study was initiated. Treatment continued until disease progression,
intolerable toxicity, or alternative therapy was required.

Screening and baseline tumor assessments (including
computed tomography [CT] scans of the chest and abdomen) took place 21 days before the first dose of linifanib
was administered. Baseline evaluations included physical
examination, assessment of ECOG PS, pregnancy and laboratory tests, multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or
echocardiogram, and blood samples to determine serum afetoprotein (AFP) levels.22-24 Blood samples were collected
at defined visits to assess serum AFP levels. CT scans were
performed every 8 weeks. Dynamic contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) scans were
obtained optionally at selected study sites. Scans were performed on days 1 and 15, before the administration of linifanib to assess baseline tumor perfusion and endothelial
surface area via the volume transferring constant (Ktrans).
An independent central imaging center performed all
blinded CT and DCE-MRI tumor assessments using
RECIST.20 Survival assessments were collected after treatment, every 4 months to 6 months for 2 years. Echocardiograms or MUGA scans were repeated every 16 weeks.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the progressionfree rate (PFR) at 16 weeks based on radiographic image
assessment as per RECIST.20 Secondary efficacy endpoints included time to disease progression (TTP), overall
survival (OS), and ORR. Safety was assessed by monitoring laboratory results, ECOG PS, and adverse events
(AEs), which were graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3).21
Using a PFR of 20% as the uninteresting rate (H0)
and 40% as the interesting rate (H1), with a sample size of
36 patients, this study had 90% power at a 1-sided type I
error rate of 0.10. The PFR was calculated for all dosed
patients independent of study drug discontinuation.
Time-to-event variables were summarized using the
Kaplan-Meier method.25 TTP was the number of days
from the first dose of linifanib to the earliest evidence of
clinical or radiographic disease progression. Data were
censored at the date of the last tumor assessment (clinical
assessment by investigator or radiographic assessment by
central imaging center, whichever was last) for patients
who did not experience disease progression.
The exploratory biomarkers assessed were measured
using the following assays: VEGF was assessed using the
MILLIPLEX kit (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica,
Mass); placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-related
tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), cancer antigen (CA) 125,26 and
protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II
(PIVKA)27 were assessed using ARCHITECT kits
(Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Ill); cytokeratin

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 44 patients across 6 centers were enrolled from
September 2007 to August 2008. The median age of the
patients was 62.5 years. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Approximately 56% of the 27
patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection received
anti-HBV therapy while on study, including lamivudine
(37%) and entecavir (19%). Approximately 52% of
patients had an ECOG PS of 0. The median dose intensity of linifanib was 79%. The median initial dose was
15.0 mg (range, 10.0 mg-25.0 mg) for all patients.
Endpoints

For all patients, the estimated PFR at 16 weeks was 31.8%
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 18.6%-47.6%). The
median TTP was 3.7 months (95% CI, 1.9 months-5.5
382

months) (Table 2) (Fig. 1A), the median TTP radiographic (TTPr) was 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.6 months-7.3
months) (Table 2), and the median OS was 9.7 months
(95% CI, 6.0 months-12.2 months) (Table 2) (Fig. 1B).
Patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function had
numerically better outcomes than patients with ChildPugh class B hepatic function, including with regard to
PFR (34.2% vs 16.7%) and median OS (10.4 months vs
2.5 months) (Table 2). Four patients (all of whom had
Child-Pugh class A hepatic function) achieved a partial
response (PR), 1 of whom had received prior local (transarterial chemoembolization and transarterial embolization) and systemic (5-fluorouracil and thalidomide)
therapies. The estimated ORR was 9.1% (95% CI, 2.5%21.7%) overall and 10.5% (95% CI, 2.9%-24.8%) in
patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function as per
central imaging (Table 2) (Fig. 2A). In an exploratory
analysis of 30 patients with baseline and postbaseline
AFP, 17 (57%) demonstrated a > 50% reduction in the
AFP level from baseline (Fig. 2B). The median time to the
first instance of a > 50% reduction in AFP from baseline
was 57 days. Changes in AFP did not appear to be

function and 2 with Child-Pugh class B hepatic function).
Additional AEs (regardless of relation with linifanib)
included skin reaction (2.3%) and hypothyroidism
(4.5%). There was 1 death that was possibly related to
linifanib (intracranial hemorrhage on day 112 in a patient
with Child-Pugh class B hepatic function). Contributing
factors to this event, reported by the investigator, included
liver failure resulting in abnormal coagulation times (prothrombin time of 32.5 seconds and activated partial
thromboplastin time of > 180 seconds; International
Normalized Ratio, 2.95), thrombocytopenia (platelet
count, 80,000/lL), and controlled hypertension (patient
had preexisting hypertension). One patient had a  10%
decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction. This was evaluated by the investigator as not being an AE, and was
asymptomatic. One patient with multiple cardiac risk factors had serious AEs of myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and cardiac failure, which occurred 13 days after the
last dose of linifanib and resolved within 9 days.
AEs led to dose interruptions in 30 patients (68.2%)
and dose reductions in 18 patients (40.9%). Patients
received linifanib for a median of 100.5 days (107.0 days
for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function and
24.5 days for patients with Child-Pugh class B hepatic
function). Dose interruptions in  3 patients were due to
hypertension (20.5%), proteinuria (13.6%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (15.9%), rash (6.8%), and fatigue
(6.8%). Hypertension and proteinuria were generally reversible. Dose reductions in  3 patients were due to
hypertension (20.5%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia
(13.6%), and proteinuria (6.8%). Twenty-nine patients
discontinued treatment because of progressive disease
(clinical, radiographic, or AE related to progressive disease), 9 discontinuted treatment because of AEs not
related to progressive disease, and 5 discontinuted treatment for other reasons including loss to follow-up. At the
time of last follow-up, 1 patient continued to receive lini384

sorafenib.
Exploratory Pharmacodynamics

Increases in VEGF were observed but did not reach statistical significance. Increases in PlGF concentrations (P <
.001) and a decrease in sFlt-1 (P ¼ .005) were observed.
Lower baseline concentrations of CA 125, CRP,
CYFRA21.1, and PIVKA were associated with improved
OS (Table 4). An exploratory analysis of biomarker
changes demonstrated that 52% of patients had a  25%
decrease in CA 125 from baseline to day 22 (54% concordance with AFP changes), and demonstrated improved
OS compared with patients without a decreased CA 125
level. Serum PIVKA was decreased in 11 of 30 evaluable
patients and was also associated with improved OS (Pearson correlation value, 0.42; P ¼ .0039).
DISCUSSION
In this phase 2 trial, the activity and safety profile of the
novel VEGFR and PDGFR selective inhibitor linifanib
were evaluated in patients with unresectable or metastatic
HCC. Targeting kinase inhibition, which plays a critical
role in angiogenesis, proliferation, and cell survival, has
been validated as an effective treatment strategy for patients

with HCC in 2 independent phase 3 trials of sorafenib,
which is the only agent to demonstrate a survival benefit in
patients with advanced HCC.7,8 This heterogeneous disease poses a significant challenge due to the majority of
HCC patients having advanced disease and concurrent cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis, and the variable clinical
course of the disease depending on its etiology.1,33 The majority of patients present with unresectable HCC and
diminished hepatic function and therefore have a poor
prognosis and very limited therapeutic options.22 Based on
unplanned, retrospective analyses, patients in phase 3 studies of sorafenib with predominantly HBV-related disease
had shorter TTPr and OS compared with those with primarily hepatitis C virus (HCV)- or alcohol-related disease.7,8 The poorer prognosis for patients with HBVrelated HCC remains controversial. The majority of
patients in the current linifanib trial had HBV infection
(61%) and metastatic disease (66%), which is similar to
patients in 2 HCC studies of the in-class agents sorafenib
and brivanib.8,34 In the current study, the majority of
patients (91%) had good ECOG PS and preserved (ChildPugh class A) hepatic function (86%), as seen in studies of
sorafenib and brivanib therapy in patients with HCC.6-8,34
In the current study, the primary efficacy endpoint,
PFR at 16 weeks, was estimated as 31.8%, resulting in a
positive trial outcome according to the study design,

20% PFR from the 80% CI for the PFR at 16 weeks
(22.8%-40.8%). The TTPr (median, 5.4 months) and
OS (median, 9.7 months) were independently assessed. In
phase 2 studies of sorafenib and brivanib in patients with
HCC, TTPr ranged from 2.8 months to 5.5 months and
OS from 9.2 months to 10.0 months.6,34 In randomized
trials of sorafenib, TTPr prolongation was reported to be
the principal effect, because time to symptomatic disease
progression was not found to be significantly different for
sorafenib compared with placebo.7,8
Linifanib demonstrated clinical activity as a single
agent, with an ORR of 9.1% per central review. A phase 2
study of sorafenib reported a response rate of 2.2%,10
which is consistent with ORRs observed in phase 3 trials
of sorafenib (2.3%-3.3%).7,8 In the current trial, 7 of the
44 patients (15.9%) achieved a confirmed PR as per investigator assessments. Although exploratory, the current
analysis is noteworthy because the investigator assessments determined patient management and continuation
of linifanib. Importantly, the clinical benefit of linifanib
was observed in patients of predominantly Asian ethnicity
(89%), and patients who had received both first-line
(82%) and second-line (18%) treatment. It should be
noted that similar outcomes (with regard to TTP and OS)
were observed in Chinese and non-Chinese patients.35
However, it is unclear whether linifanib provided a benefit
to the limited number of patients with Child-Pugh class B
hepatic function, corroborating the results of other in-class
compounds.36,37 The presence of hepatic impairment or
Child-Pugh status did not appear to have an effect on the
pharmacokinetics of linifanib.38 The patient population in
the current phase 2 study was similar to populations from
the sorafenib portion of the Asia-Pacific phase 3 trial8 in
terms of the percentages of patients with Child-Pugh class
A hepatic function (86% vs 97%), HBV infection (61% vs
71%), HCV infection (9% vs 11%), and extrahepatic dissemination (66% vs 69%). In all, 7% of patients in the current study had 3 target tumor sites (designated as target
lesions), whereas in the sorafenib arm of the Asia-Pacific
trial, 52% of patients had  3 tumor sites, which may have
included nontarget lesions. In the current study, the precise
percentage of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
(BCLC) stage C disease was unknown. Nevertheless, at
least 82% of patients (36 of 44 patients) were known to
have BCLC stage C disease because they had metastatic disease and/or an ECOG PS of 1 or 2 at baseline.
Sorafenib was evaluated in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced HCC in a phase 2 study.
Compared with doxorubicin alone, this combination
resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTPr

(6.4 months vs 2.8 months), OS (13.7 months vs 6.5
months), and progression-free survival (PFS) (6.0 months
vs 2.7 months).39 A separate phase 1 study of sorafenib in
combination with everolimus (2.5 mg or 5.0 mg) did not
achieve a biologically active dose of everolimus for combination treatment, precluding its further development for
the treatment of HCC.40 Pazopanib, another multikinase
inhibitor, demonstrated clinical activity as a single agent
in a phase 1 trial, with an estimated PFS of 17.7 weeks.41
Both sorafenib combination studies reported significant
toxicities,39,40 emphasizing the need to identify and develop more effective single-agent targeted therapies.
Linifanib-related AEs included fatigue, diarrhea,
hypertension, and rash. The most common linifanib toxicities have also been observed in patients with HCC who
are treated with sorafenib6-8 and brivanib.34 The rate of
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%) was
comparable to rates observed with sorafenib (21%45%).6-8 Higher rates of hypertension (39% for any grade
and 25% for grade  3) with linifanib treatment compared with sorafenib trials (5%-19% for any grade and
2% for grade  3),7,8 may reflect an on-target anti-VEGF
mechanism.15 Hypertension rates in patients treated with
linifanib were more similar to those observed in a trial of
brivanib (46% for any grade and 11% for grade  3).34
Hemorrhagic events (including a case of intracranial hemorrhage) were observed, but were more common in the
subset of patients with Child-Pugh class B hepatic
function.
Several biomarkers were evaluated, including those
that were related to VEGFR, such as PlGF, sFlt-1, and
VEGF. The lack of a statistically significant change with
VEGF could be a reflection of the insensitivity of the
luminex-based muliplex assay that was used. Tumor
markers for HCC include the most commonly used
marker, AFP. Serum AFP levels, in conjunction with radiographic imaging, provide a valuable marker for monitoring the burden of metastatic and/or recurrent disease, and
therapeutic response in patients with HCC.22,23 In this
trial, 89% of patients had elevated AFP levels at baseline.
It is interesting to note that, in an exploratory analysis of
30 patients with both baseline and postbaseline AFP,
57% had a > 50% reduction from baseline; these results
are similar to a study of brivanib in which 76% of patients
had elevated AFP levels at baseline and 56% experienced a
> 50% reduction.34
Other investigational tumor markers include CA
125 (conventionally used to monitor ovarian cancer),
CYFRA21.1 (cytokeratin fragments released by tumor apoptosis and necrosis), the inflammatory marker CRP, and
386

PIVKA. Plasma levels of these markers have demonstrated
usefulness as potential prognostic indicators of outcome
in patients with cancer,28,29 including HCC,42-44 because
increased levels may be reflective of increased tumor burden. CA 125 and PIVKA may also provide information
regarding patient responses in addition to AFP. CA 125
was shown to be a more sensitive marker for detecting
HCC compared with AFP.45,46 Use of CA 125 as a monitoring marker in patients with HCC is relatively unexplored but the results presented herein demonstrate an
association between a decrease in CA 125 and a positive
outcome. Further comprehensive studies will be required
to assess and confirm the usefulness of these markers in
patient prognosis and monitoring.
Linifanib is a potent and selective VEGF and PDGF
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that may be given continuously as an oral formulation via once-daily dosing.
The compelling clinical activity and acceptable safety profile observed in the current study indicate that further
evaluation in patients with advanced HCC is warranted.
A global randomized phase 3 study comparing the clinical
activity of linifanib versus sorafenib in patients with HCC
is ongoing.47
