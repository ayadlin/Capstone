Abstract
Epidemiologic and animal studies revealed that capsaicin can act as a carcinogen or cocarcinogen. However, the molecular mechanisms of the cancer-promoting effects of capsaicin are not clear. Here, we report
that capsaicin has a cocarcinogenic effect on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)–promoted skin
carcinogenesis in vivo and is mediated through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but not the
transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). Topical application of capsaicin on the
dorsal skin of 7,12-dimetylbenz(a)anthracene–initiated and TPA-promoted TRPV1 wild-type (WT) and TRPV1
knockout (KO) mice induced more and larger skin tumors in TRPV1/KO mice, suggesting a TRPV1-independent
mechanism. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was highly elevated by capsaicin treatment in tumors and murine embryonic fibroblasts from TRPV1/KO mice. Inhibitors of EGFR/MEK signaling suppressed TPA/capsaicininduced COX-2 expression in TRPV1/KO cells, indicating that activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling
is involved in COX-2 elevation. Capsaicin induced a further induction of TPA-increased COX-2 expression in
EGFR/WT cells, but not in EGFR/KO cells. TPA/capsaicin cotreatment caused EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
and activated EGFR downstream signaling, including ERKs and Akt in EGFR/WT, but not EGFR/KO cells. Specific inhibition of EGFR and TRPV1 indicated that capsaicin-induced ERK activation in A431 cells was dependent
on EGFR, but not TRPV1. Together, these findings suggest that capsaicin might act as a cocarcinogen in TPAinduced skin carcinogenesis through EGFR-dependent mechanisms. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6859–69. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is a principal
pungent ingredient of Capsicum fruits, which are widely
consumed worldwide. It is used in topical creams and its
role in carcinogenesis is controversial. Capsaicin induces the
apoptosis of cancers cells, including myeloid leukemia (1), human hepatoma (2), and colon cancer (3). However, epidemiologic and animal experimental evidence suggests that
capsaicin also acts as a carcinogen or cocarcinogen, particularly during the tumor promotion stage (4). Capsaicin from
chili peppers promoted stomach and liver cancer in BALB/c

mice (5) and also induced duodenal adenocarcinoma in mice
(6). Epidemiologic studies suggested a positive association between the incidence of stomach cancer and the consumption
of chili pepper–rich diets (7). Capsaicin enhanced the metastasis of murine breast cancer cells by reducing the expression
of apoptosis-related genes (8) and induced LNCaP prostate
cancer cell proliferation by increasing androgen receptor expression through the activation of ERKs and Akt (9). Thus, clarifying the underlying molecular mechanisms to reveal whether
or not capsaicin exerts carcinogenic activities is important.
Transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member
1 (TRPV1) is a ligand-gated cation channel with limited
selectivity for calcium ions. TRPV1 is activated by noxious
stimuli including heat, acid, and vanilloid compounds such
as capsaicin (10). Capsaicin is a selective agonist of TRPV1
and causes TRPV1 to be desensitized after activation. TRPV1
is widely expressed in primary afferent neurons and also in
nonneuronal tissues, including skin keratinocytes, fibroblasts, liver, prostate, and bladder smooth muscle (11). Thus,
studying the function of TRPV1 in a broader context than
pain perception is relevant. Although the biological role of
TRPV1 in cells other than primary sensory neurons is unclear, some studies indicated a role for TRPV1 in carcinogenesis. Increased expression of TRPV1 was detected in prostate,
colon, and pancreatic cancers (12), whereas the expression of
TRPV1 was found to decrease as bladder cancer and brain
tumor malignancy progressed (13, 14), suggesting that
TRPV1 might negatively control tumor progression. Our

recent study also suggested that TRPV1 might act as a tumor
suppressor in skin cancer (15).
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor
tyrosine kinase that mediates intracellular signaling in response to various extracellular stimuli. By binding with its
ligands, EGFR activates intracellular signaling cascades including Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/
Akt, and subsequently controls proliferation, migration, and
apoptosis. EGFR is overexpressed in colorectal, pancreatic,
lung, and non–small cell lung cancers (16). Aberrant regulation of EGFR activates downstream signals including ERKs
and Akt resulting in increased tumor cell proliferation, survival, and invasiveness. Thus, modulation of EGFR signaling
is key in preventing cancers. However, a role for capsaicin in
the regulation of EGFR to mediate its carcinogenic effects has
not been reported. Here, we show that capsaicin acts as a cocarcinogen in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)–
induced skin cancer and its action is mediated through
EGFR-dependent mechanisms. Notably, TRPV1, which was
shown to exert a tumor-suppressive effect in skin cancer, is
not a primary target of capsaicin in skin tumor development.

Immunoprecipitation
Cells were cultured to 70% confluence and starved in
serum-free DMEM for 24 hours. Cells were then treated with
50 μmol/L of capsaicin, followed by 20 ng/mL of TPA for various times. Cells were disrupted with lysis buffer (18) and
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes by microcentrifuge.
Lysates (1,000 μg) were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against agarose-conjugated EGFR overnight at 4°C.
After washing, beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot to assess the expression level of phosphotyrosine.

according to the instructions of the manufacturer. cDNA was
synthesized using a reverse transcription system purchased
from Promega, and amplified using i-Star Taq DNA polymerase obtained from iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc. (Korea).
The sense and antisense primers cox-2 mRNA were 5′GGGTTGCTGGGGGAAGAAATGTG-3′ and 5′-GGTGGCTGTTTTGGTAGGCTGTG-3′, respectively, which yielded a 479-bp
PCR product. The amplification conditions for COX-2 were
28 cycles of 94°C for 45 seconds, 60°C for 45 seconds, and
72°C for 60 seconds, followed by one cycle for 5 minutes at
72°C. The sense and antisense primers gapdh mRNA were
5′ - CC CC T T C A T T G AC C T CA A CT A C AT G G - 3′ a n d 5 GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGTC-3′, respectively,

28 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and
72°C for 60 seconds, followed by one cycle for 5 minutes at
72°C. The primers and amplification conditions for HB-EGF
and amphiregulin were previously described and reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was conducted following the same procedure as described (19).
In vivo mouse studies
TRPV1/KO B6, 129S4-Trpv1 mice, and wild-type (TRPV1/
WT) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
Mice were divided into eight groups each of TRPV1/WT
and TRPV1/KO and matched by age and gender. All eight
groups were initiated by topical application of 200 nmol of
7,12-dimetylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) in acetone. Two
weeks later, TPA ± capsaicin or capsaicin-only treatment
was begun and continued twice a week for 21 weeks. Groups
1, 3, 5, and 7 comprised wild-type (TRPV1/WT) mice and
groups 2, 4, 6, and 8 were knockout (TRPV1/KO) mice.
Groups 1 and 2 were treated with acetone only; groups
3 and 4 were treated with 17 nmol of TPA only; groups
5 and 6 were treated with 10 μmol of capsaicin followed
30 minutes later with 17 nmol of TPA; and groups 7 and
8 were treated with 10 μmol capsaicin only. All treatments
were applied topically in acetone. Mice were weighed, photographed, and tumors measured once a week beginning when
first measurable tumors (1 mm3) were observed (week 12).

rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation
with proteinase K solution. To eliminate endogenous peroxidases, slides were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide,
followed by blocking treatment with 3% bovine serum albumin solution. Slides were incubated overnight with an affinitypurified primary antibody at 4°C and then developed using the
Histostain Plus Kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The reaction
was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
and counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Statistical analyses
Where necessary, data are presented as means ± SD. The
Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA was used for single statistical comparisons. A probability value of P < 0.05 was used
as the criterion for statistical significance.

Results
Capsaicin induces TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis
more strongly in TRPV1/KO mice
TRPV1/WT and KO mice were subjected to the wellknown two-stage skin carcinogenesis experiment with
DMBA/TPA. Coapplication of capsaicin with TPA to the
dorsal surface of either TRPV1/WT or KO mice induced significantly more and larger skin tumors compared with TPA
treatment alone (Table 1; Fig. 1A–C). Furthermore, TRPV1/KO
mice developed more skin tumors than WT mice in response
to cotreatment with TPA and capsaicin (Table 1; Fig. 1A–C).
In contrast, treatment with only capsaicin or vehicle did not
induce any skin tumors in either TRPV1/WT or KO mice
(Table 1; Fig. 1C), indicating that capsaicin alone does not
act as a carcinogen. All mice (100%) in both groups developed papillomas in response to TPA and capsaicin by
21 weeks (Fig. 1D), whereas ∼20% of TRPV1/WT mice
versus 75% of TRPV1/KO mice developed tumors in response to TPA only (Table 1; ref. 15). These results suggest

that capsaicin might act as a cocarcinogen through TRPV1independent mechanisms.
Capsaicin increases TPA-induced COX-2 expression
more strongly in TRPV1/KO mice
Increased amounts of COX-2 are commonly found in both
malignant tissues and tumors, including skin cancer (20). We
examined COX-2 protein abundance in tumors extracted
from mouse skin. Both TRPV1/WT and KO mice treated with
capsaicin and TPA together exhibited higher COX-2 protein
levels than groups treated with TPA alone (Fig. 2A), and tumors from TRPV1/KO mice expressed the highest level of
COX-2 as a result of treatment with capsaicin and TPA together (Fig. 2A). Western blot results confirmed that tumor
lysates from TRPV1/KO mice treated with capsaicin and TPA
exhibited significantly higher levels of COX-2 than TRPV1/
WT mice (Fig. 2B). Additionally, tumors from TRPV1/KO
mice cotreated with capsaicin and TPA exhibited higher
COX-2 expression levels compared with mice treated with
TPA alone (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that capsaicin acts
through a TRPV1-independent mechanism to induce COX-2
expression in the presence of TPA.
Capsaicin increases TPA-induced COX-2 expression in
TRPV1/KO cells
Genomic PCR and Western blot analysis verified that the
TRPV1 gene and protein were only detected in TRPV1/WT
MEFs (Fig. 3A). In addition, elevated COX-2 expression levels
were seen in response to cotreatment with capsaicin and
TPA in TRPV1/KO MEFs (Fig. 3B). To determine the signaling molecules involved in COX-2 upregulation by capsaicin
and TPA, chemical inhibitors for EGFR and downstream
MEK signals were used. AG1478 (an EGFR inhibitor) and
U0126 (a MEK inhibitor) distinctly suppressed TPA/capsaicininduced COX-2 expression in TRPV1/KO MEFs, suggesting a
possible role of the EGFR pathway in capsaicin-induced
COX-2 upregulation when TRPV1 is depleted (Fig. 3C).

We then determined the inhibitory effect of AG1478 on the
phosphorylation of MEK, one of the direct downstream substrates of EGFR, and that of U0126 on the phosphorylation of
ERKs, a direct downstream substrate of MEK. TPA/capsaicininduced phosphorylations of MEK and ERK were suppressed
by AG1478 and U0126, respectively, suggesting that each inhibitor blocks its respective target in this cell system (Fig. 3D).

only detected in EGFR/WT MEFs (Fig. 4A). Treatment with
capsaicin alone did not induce COX-2 expression when EGFR
was depleted (Fig. 4B). Similarly, TPA-induced COX-2 expression was only increased by capsaicin in EGFR/WT MEFs
(Fig. 4C). To determine whether TPA-induced COX-2 expression is regulated by capsaicin at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level, we measured cox-2 mRNA levels using
RT-PCR. Capsaicin upregulated cox-2 mRNA expression more
strongly than TPA alone, and the TPA/capsaicin-induced
cox-2 mRNA level was higher in EGFR/WT cells than KO
(Fig. 4D). These results indicate that cox-2 is upregulated
by TPA/capsaicin treatment at the transcriptional level and

support the idea that capsaicin-induced COX-2 expression is
dependent on the EGFR pathway.

indicating that EGFR plays a key role in capsaicin-induced
activation of downstream intracellular signal pathways.

EGFR downstream signaling is sustainably activated
in response to TPA and capsaicin only in the
presence of EGFR
After the activation of EGFR, several intracellular signaling
pathways, including ERK and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt,
are recruited to EGFR and subsequently activated (21). Cotreatment with capsaicin and TPA induced the phosphorylation of ERKs and Akt in EGFR/WT MEFs more strongly than
in EGFR/KO MEFs (Fig. 5A). The more time that passed after
cotreatment with TPA and capsaicin, the more strongly sustained was the phosphorylation of ERKs and Akt in EGFR/WT
MEFs (Fig. 5B). In EGFR/KO cells, however, TPA/capsaicin
treatment had little effect on ERKs or Akt phosphorylation,

Activation of EGFR signaling in response to TPA
and capsaicin is dependent on both EGFR
and Src activation
Treatment with AG1478 or PP2 (an Src inhibitor) showed
that sustained activation of ERKs and Akt was still dependent on EGFR activation but also on Src (Fig. 5C). Next, tyrosine
phosphorylation of EGFR was determined by immunoprecipitating cells with anti-EGFR and subsequent immunoblotting
with a phosphotyrosine antibody. Treatment with TPA and
capsaicin together induced phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine residues (Fig. 5D, top). Because EGFR was reported to be
activated intracellularly by Src kinase, we next examined the
effect of PP2 on TPA/capsaicin-induced EGFR phosphorylation

EGFR-Dependent Cocarcinogenic Effect of Capsaicin

and found that the TPA/capsaicin-induced EGFR phosphorylation was suppressed by PP2 (Fig. 5D, bottom). Phosphorylation of EGFR was also blocked by AG1478 (Fig. 5D, bottom).
To further confirm the importance of Src for TPA/capsaicin-

induced signal activation, we examined the effect of siRNA-Src
on TPA/capsaicin-induced COX-2 expression. Transfection
of siRNA-Src resulted in the complete inhibition of COX-2
expression in response to TPA/capsaicin cotreatment, suggesting the important role of Src activation (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B).
Activation of the EGFR pathway in response to TPA
and capsaicin is mediated through matrix
metalloproteinase activation and
EGF-like ligand production
Several studies showed that EGFR could be transactivated
in the absence of its direct ligands through the activation of
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and subsequent production
of EGF-like ligands (22). We determined that inhibition of
MMP activation by GM6001 (an MMP inhibitor) and the
reduction of HB-EGF, an EGF-like ligand, by a neutralizing
antibody, resulted in the inactivation of EGFR signaling
(Supplementary Fig. S2A), suggesting the involvement of
MMP-dependent EGF-like ligand production in capsaicin/
TPA-induced EGFR transactivation. We next measured the
production of HB-EGF and amphiregulin, a major EGF-like ligand induced by MMP activation, using RT-PCR. Amphiregulin
was highly increased and HB-EGF was slightly induced by cotreatment with TPA/capsaicin from 15 minutes to 4 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). The induction of EGF-like ligands
becomes potentiated at later times, suggesting the contributable role of EGF-like ligands on the sustained activation of
EGFR downstream signaling.

A, EGFR is expressed only in EGFR/WT. Cells were lysed and membrane
and cytosolic fractions separated and EGFR abundance determined by

capsaicin (0, 10, or 50 μmol/L) for 4 h and COX-2 protein abundance

were treated with capsaicin (0, 10, or 50 μmol/L) for 30 min followed by
TPA (20 ng/mL) for 4 h. Cells were lysed and COX-2 expression analyzed
by Western blot. D, capsaicin strongly upregulates TPA-induced cox-2
mRNA expression in EGFR/WT cells. EGFR/WT and KO cells were

EGFR and downstream signaling are activated by
capsaicin in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells
To determine whether capsaicin truly activates EGFR and
downstream signaling, we examined the effect of capsaicin in
A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, which overexpress
EGFR (23). Capsaicin treatment induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr992, which is important for the activation of downstream ERKs and Akt for cell survival (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Through the activation of EGFR, capsaicin induces
phosphorylation of downstream effectors including ERKs in
A431 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). To reveal the mechanism involved in capsaicin-induced ERK phosphorylation,
we used EGFR inhibitors and TRPV1 antagonists. The results
indicated that capsaicin-induced ERK phosphorylation was
dependent on EGFR activation, but independent of TRPV1
activation (Supplementary Fig. S3C). To further reveal whether
capsaicin-induced EGFR activation was dependent on Src and
MMP activations, we examined the effect of PP2 and GM6001.
Capsaicin-induced EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited by
PP2 or GM6001 (Supplementary Fig. S3D), suggesting that
capsaicin induces EGFR phosphorylation through the activations of Src and MMP.

Discussion
TRPV1 is involved in the regulation of pain pathways (24).
Capsaicin initially activates TRPV1 and excites nociceptive
neurons, leading to the perception of pain. However,

Figure 5. Comparison of EGFR downstream signals activated by TPA and capsaicin cotreatment in EGFR/WT and KO MEFs. A, TPA and capsaicin
cotreatment induces sustained activation of ERKs and Akt dose-dependently only in EGFR/WT MEFs. Cells (1.2 × 106) were cultured overnight and starved
for 24 h and then treated with capsaicin (0, 10, or 50 μmol/L) for 30 min followed by TPA (20 ng/mL) for another 4 h. Cells were lysed and the expression
of each protein was analyzed by Western blot. B, cotreatment with TPA and capsaicin induces the phosphorylation of EGFR downstream targets, ERKs
and Akt, time-dependently and more strongly in EGFR/WT MEFs. Cells (1.2×106) were cultured overnight and starved for 24 h and then treated with
capsaicin (0, 10, or 50 μmol/L) for 30 min and then TPA (20 ng/mL). Cells were lysed and protein abundance was analyzed by Western blot. C, sustained
phosphorylation of ERKs and Akt is dependent on EGFR and Src activation. Cells were treated with AG1478 (EGFR inhibitor) or PP2 (Src inhibitor) as
indicated for 30 min followed by capsaicin (50 μmol/L). Cells were then treated with TPA (20 ng/mL) for 4 h. Cells were lysed and phosphorylation of
ERKs and Akt was assessed by Western blot. D, capsaicin induces EGFR phosphorylation in combination with TPA (top). Cells were treated with capsaicin
for 30 min followed by TPA (0, 5, 15, or 30 min). Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphorylated tyrosine.
TPA/capsaicin-induced EGFR phosphorylation is dependent on Src activation (bottom). EGFR/WT MEFs were treated with AG1478 or PP2 30 min before

EGFR-Dependent Cocarcinogenic Effect of Capsaicin

that TRPV1-unresponsive or deficient states might be clinically important with exposure to capsaicin for a prolonged
period. Because capsaicin-induced initial activation of
TRPV1 is inevitably followed by desensitization, the possibility that capsaicin affects intracellular signals independently
of TRPV1 cannot be excluded (26). TRPV1 expression was reportedly reduced in aged mice, an effect that corresponded
with loss of noxious sensitivity in aging animals (27). Thus, to
determine the effects and target proteins of capsaicin when
TRPV1 is physiologically absent is important.
TRPV1 is distributed widely in many cell types other than
sensory neurons (11). In skin, TRPV1 is also expressed in keratinocytes and fibroblasts (28). TRPV1 activation is involved in
inflammatory responses in human keratinocytes through the
release of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandin E2
and interleukin-8 (28), and UV irradiation-increased MMP-1 is
mediated by TRPV1 in keratinocytes (29). In contrast, keratinocytes were reportedly resistant to vanilloid-induced TRPV1 activation and subsequent calcium influx (30). In our previous
studies, we confirmed that TRPV1 expression was depleted in
skin cancer tissues, and lack of TRPV1 corresponded with increased incidence of mouse skin cancer development mediated
by high levels of EGFR (15). These results indicated that agents
activating EGFR signaling could lead to the induction of skin
tumors in TRPV1/KO mice. In the present study, we found that
capsaicin induced DMBA-initiated and TPA-promoted skin carcinogenesis more readily in TRPV1/KO mice than in WT mice,
through the upregulation of COX-2 expression, and EGFR signaling was involved in capsaicin-induced COX-2 expression in
the absence of TRPV1. TRPV1 has been considered as an inflammatory receptor based on the findings that nociception and
proinflammatory mediators are evoked through the activation
of TRPV1 (24). In addition, TRPV1 has been reported to be
elevated in inflammatory diseases of specific tissues including
colon (31), and several cancers such as prostate and pancreatic
cancers (12). Recently, however, a paradoxical role of TRPV1 as
both proinflammatory and protective has emerged (32). For
example, TRPV1 reportedly mediates protection against chemically induced colitis (33).
EGFR is frequently overexpressed and abnormally activated in many types of cancers. EGFR has an extracellular
ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic catalytic domain. After ligands bind
with the ectodomain of EGFR, these receptors form homodimers or heterodimers, leading to the autophosphorylation of
tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain and activation
of the receptors' intrinsic kinase activity (34). Phosphotyrosine residues in the EGFR kinase domain recruit downstream
effectors that contain Src homology-2 or phosphotyrosinebinding domains, resulting in the activation of signaling
pathways including MEK/ERK, Akt, and Src. We found that
capsaicin potentiated TPA-mediated ERKs and Akt phosphorylation only in EGFR-expressing cells through induction
of EGFR phosphorylation. The activation of EGFR downstream signaling by TPA and capsaicin was dependent on
EGFR and Src activation. Additionally, ectodomain shedding
of HB-EGF by MMP was also involved in the TPA/capsaicinmediated EGFR signaling cascades.

Evidence indicates that EGFR can be activated in the
absence of its direct ligands. Cholesterol depletion by methylβ-cyclodextrin was reported to induce EGFR phosphorylation without release of membrane-bound EGFR ligands,
suggesting that ligand-independent EGFR activation can take
place (35). One possible mechanism of ligand-independent
EGFR activation is the direct phosphorylation of the EGFR
kinase domain by intracellular mediators. Previously, the induction of c-Src was reported as a prerequisite of arsenicinduced EGFR and downstream ERK activation (36). We
found that although an EGFR inhibitor blocked TPA/
capsaicin-induced EGFR downstream signals, none of the
inhibitors of MMP, Src, or HB-EGF completely interfered
with the TPA/capsaicin-mediated EGFR downstream signals.
These results suggest that other mechanisms, such as ligandindependent EGFR activation, might be involved.
Even though epidemiologic studies suggested a positive
association between the consumption of capsaicin or chili
pepper–rich diets and the incidence of cancers in humans,
whether the EGFR activation caused by capsaicin is involved
is not clear. Among many cancers, accumulating evidence
focused on the causative effects of capsaicin-containing
diets on stomach or gallbladder cancers (7, 37). Stomach
cancer is a major cancer expressing high levels of EGFR.
According to a recent human study in Chinese patients with
gastric carcinoma, ∼42% of cases showed elevated expression levels of EGFR (38). Another study also revealed that
EGFR overexpression was detected in patients with gastric
carcinoma, which was associated with an unfavorable prognosis (39). Similarly, EGFR overexpression is frequently
reported in patients with gallbladder cancer (40). Our present findings that EGFR activation induced by capsaicin in
skin cancer leads to a cancer-promoting effect underlies
the relevance of epidemiologic reports of capsaicin to the
incidence of EGFR-overexpressed human cancers.
Spice-derived phytochemicals including capsaicin have
suggested potential chemopreventive effects (41). The anticarcinogenic effects of capsaicin are achieved through various mechanisms, including apoptosis (42). A major
mechanism by which capsaicin exhibits its anticarcinogenic
effects might be the inhibition of NF-κB and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 activation. Capsaicin
was reported to block NF-κB activation induced by diverse
agents including phorbol esters in leukemia cells (43) and in
the two-stage skin carcinogenesis model (44, 45). Capsaicin
was found to block signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3 activation as well as to downregulate its
dependent gene products including cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and
survivin (46). Although our study indicates that capsaicin
might act as a cocarcinogen in the DMBA/TPA-promoted
skin cancer model, the anticarcinogenic potential of capsaicin cannot be excluded.
A recent study assessing the oncogenic potential of capsaicin revealed that dermal application of capsaicin did not
lead to the induction of preneoplastic or neoplastic skin
lesions in the Tg.Ac mouse model (47). Consistent with this
result, our study showed that capsaicin alone did not cause
skin carcinogenesis. Capsaicin was reported to cause a

burning sensation and skin irritation when applied topically
and to induce the erosion of gastric mucosa and hepatic necrosis when administrated in large amounts (48). Although
capsaicin could induce cancer cell death, it can also kill normal neuronal cells (49). Although whether capsaicin has
genotoxic and carcinogenic effects remains controversial,
evidence supports these suspected adverse effects of capsaicin. We found that capsaicin might act as a cocarcinogen
by inducing the sustained activation of EGFR downstream signals through activation of EGFR. Capsaicin might promote
cancer cell survival in the absence of TRPV1 (14). Similar to
capsaicin, tumor necrosis factor is suspected to both induce
and reduce cancer cell growth, and was shown to commit cells
to survival when stimulating EGFR transactivation mechanisms, indicating that EGFR could act as a molecular switch determining the antiapoptotic effect of tumor necrosis factor
(50). Thus, capsaicin might commit tumors to survival and
evade apoptosis in the absence of TRPV1 through the activation of EGFR. However, because capsaicin is also reported to
induce proinflammatory signals through the activation of
TRPV1 (28), the possibility that capsaicin induces inflammation and affects cancer development in a TRPV1-dependent
manner cannot be excluded.

In summary, our data suggest that capsaicin has a cocarcinogenic effect in TPA-promoted skin carcinogenesis, and this
effect was more pronounced in TRPV1/KO mice than in WT
mice. Capsaicin induces the sustained activation of EGFR
downstream signals through the induction of EGFR transactivation mediated through Src and MMP-dependent mechanisms. This observation has implications for understanding
the role of EGFR in capsaicin-mediated survival of tumors.
