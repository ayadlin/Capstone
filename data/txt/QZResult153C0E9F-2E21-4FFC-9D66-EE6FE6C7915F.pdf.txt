Abstract
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone type II (GnRH-II) has an
antiproliferative effect on human endometrial cancer cells.
Apoptosis in cancer cells may play a critical role in regulating
cell proliferation. However, more studies are necessary to
elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and develop
potential applications of GnRH-II. Therefore, we explored the
mechanisms of GnRH-II–induced apoptosis and the effects of
GnRH-II on GADD45A activation in human endometrial cancer
cell lines. GnRH-II decreased cell viability in a dose- and timedependent manner. Apoptosis was induced with increased
terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling apoptotic cells after GnRH-II treatment.
Knockdown of the endogenous GnRH-I receptor with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) rescued the cells from GnRH-II–
mediated cell growth inhibition and abolished the induction of
apoptosis. GnRH-II activated extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK)-1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) in a time-dependent manner, and the activation was
abolished by GnRH-I receptor siRNA and MAPK inhibitors.
Cells pretreated with MAPK inhibitors were rescued from
GnRH-II–mediated cell growth inhibition. Moreover, both
inhibitors abolished GnRH-II–induced apoptosis. GnRH-II
induced GADD45A expression, which was abolished by
knockdown of endogenous GnRH-I receptors and MAPK
inhibitors. GnRH-II–stimulated cell growth inhibition was
rescued by knockdown of endogenous GADD45A with siRNA.
Cells treated with GADD45A siRNA were refractory to GnRHII–induced apoptosis. Thus, GnRH-II inhibits cell growth by
inducing apoptosis through binding of the GnRH-I receptor,
activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways, and
induction of GADD45A signaling. This finding may provide a
new concept relating to the mechanism of GnRH-II–induced
antiproliferation and apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells,
indicating the possibility of GnRH-II as a promising therapeutic intervention for human endometrial cancer. [Cancer Res

estrogens is one of the risk factors for endometrial cancer.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is an important molecule of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis related to estrogen
steroidogenesis in the reproduction of vertebrates. GnRH has also
been used for the therapy of reproductive cancers aside from the
physiologic regulation of gonadotropins in the brain (2, 3). In
mammals, GnRH-II is more widely identified than GnRH-I in
peripheral tissues, suggesting that GnRH-II may have additional
functions. Recent studies revealed that GnRH-II has an antiproliferative effect on breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer cells and
might be considered as a possible therapy for gynecologic cancers
(4). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well
known. The GnRH I receptor is a member of the G-protein–
coupled receptor (GPCR) family and its mRNA is expressed in
various human tissues (5). Although a putative GnRH type II
receptor has been identified in the human genome, a full-length
functional GnRH type II receptor mRNA in human tissues is still
uncertain. It is assumed that both GnRH-I and GnRH-II exert their
biological effects by binding to a common GnRH receptor, GnRH-I
receptor, but through different intracellular signaling pathways
(6–8).
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are activated
via two different categories of cell surface receptors, GPCRs and
receptor tyrosine kinases. MAPKs have been considered important
components of GnRH-induced signaling pathways in various cell
types, including endometrial cancer cells (9). We have shown that
the antiproliferative effects of GnRH-II are mediated by the p38
MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2;
refs. 10, 11). Different mechanisms have been suggested for MAPK
activation through GPCRs (12, 13). Generally, activation of the
ERK1/2 pathway is related to cell survival and proliferation. In
contrast, p38 MAPK is mainly activated by stress stimuli such as
DNA-damaging agents that can lead to cell growth inhibition or
apoptosis (14, 15). The growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible
gene 45 (GADD45a) is a cell cycle regulator that encodes a protein
activated by some cellular stress. GADD45a is an important
regulator of cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis
(16–18). Although the up-regulation of GADD45a expression by a
variety of agents that induce apoptosis has been shown, the role of
GADD45a in mediating apoptosis is not well known. GADD45a
interacts with many important intracellular signaling molecules
that may play a role in the regulation of DNA repair, cell cycle
progression, and apoptosis. The underlying molecular mechanisms
have not yet been extensively investigated.
In the present study, we examine the mechanisms of GnRH-II–
induced apoptosis on human endometrial cancer cells and the
effects of GnRH-II on GADD45a activation. We show that GnRH-II
treatment leads to apoptosis of human endometrial cancer cells,
which is mediated by GADD45a activation. Furthermore, we also

find that the antitumor effects induced by GnRH-II and GnRH-II–
stimulated GADD45a activation are through the GnRH-I receptor,
ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The human endometrial cancer cell line
Ishikawa is a well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line (19).
The ECC-1 cell line, derived from well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the
endometrium (20), was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone Laboratories, Inc.), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin and incubated at 37jC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
The cells were grown to 80% confluence and transferred to serum-free
medium for 24 h before treatment with the GnRH-II analogue. The GnRH-II
analogue, D-Arg6-Aza-Gly10-GnRH-II, was purchased from Bachem. The
MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L Na2VO3, 2 mmol/L Na4P2O7,
2% Triton X-100, 2% SDS, 1 Amol/L aprotinin, 1 Amol/L leupeptin, and
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration was
analyzed by a protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin standards
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Equal
amounts of cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.).
Following blocking with TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h,
membranes were incubated overnight at 4jC with anti–GnRH receptor
(Neomarker), anti–caspase-3 (Cell signaling), anti–phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell
signaling), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell signaling), anti–phospho-p38 MAPK
(Biosource), anti-p38 MAPK (Biosource), or anti-GADD45a (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected by
an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. The membrane was stripped with
stripping buffer (62.5 mmol/L Tris, 10 mmol/L DTT, 2% SDS, pH 6.7) at 50jC
for 30 min and reprobed with anti–h-actin (Santa Cruz) as a loading control.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT;
Sigma) was used to determine cell viability. Ishikawa and ECC-1

endometrial cancer cells (2  104 per well) were seeded in a 24-well plate
with 500 AL of medium. Cells were treated with serum-free medium
containing 100 nmol/L GnRH-II for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. MTT was added at
different time points to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and then
incubated for 4 h at 37jC. The medium was removed and DMSO was added
into each well to dissolve the crystals by shaking the plate weakly for 30 min
in the dark. The absorbance values in each treatment were then determined
at 570 nm with an ELISA reader.
Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling assay. DNA strand breaks in apoptotic cells were measured by
the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay using the in situ detection kit POD (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals). Treated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with
0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h on ice according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The permeabilized cells were then rinsed twice in PBS and
reacted with 50 AL of the TUNEL reaction mixture at 37jC for 1 h in a dark,
humidified chamber. After labeling, the cells were washed in PBS, mounted
with Gelvatol, and examined using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped
with a digital camera.
Small interfering RNA transfection. To knock down the endogenous
GnRH-I receptor or GADD45a, cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L
siGENOME ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool GnRH-I receptor small interfering
RNA (siRNA) or GADD45a siRNA (Dharmacon Research, Inc.) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for 24 h. The siCONTROL NONTARGETINGpool siRNA (Dharmacon) was used as a transfection control.
Statistical analysis. Results were presented as mean F SE. Statistical
evaluation was conducted by the t test for paired data. Multiple
comparisons were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
multiple comparison test. Significant difference was defined as P < 0.05.

Results
GnRH-II decreases cell viability in endometrial cancer cells.
The MTT assay was used to investigate the effect of GnRH-II on cell
viability in endometrial cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, 1 nmol/L,
10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, and 1 Amol/L GnRH-II significantly
decreased cell viability and reached a maximal response at 100
nmol/L and 1 Amol/L. In Fig. 1B, 100 nmol/L GnRH-II significantly

decreased cell viability in a time-dependent manner (24, 48, and
72 hours) and reached a maximum at 72 hours. Thus, the GnRH-II
dose response was done by treating with a 100 nmol/L
concentration of GnRH-II for 72 hours in the following experiments.
Experiments using the endometrial cancer cell line ECC-1 gave
comparable results (Fig. 1C and D).
GnRH-II induces apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells. The
changes of cell viability suggested the involvement of cell death
induced by GnRH-II in endometrial cancer cells. Therefore,
measurements of caspase-3 activity and the TUNEL assay were
used to investigate the GnRH-II–induced apoptosis on the Ishikawa
endometrial cancer cells. Immunoblotting results showed that
GnRH-II (100 nmol/L) treatment increased the level of cleaved
caspase-3 expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A).
Experiments using ECC-1 cells revealed comparable results
(Fig. 2B). Furthermore, 100 nmol/L GnRH-II–induced apoptosis
was identified by the TUNEL assay. In consonance with the
immunoblotting results, GnRH-II increased apoptotic cells after

Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. B, effects of si-GnRHR transfection on GnRH-II–

assay. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05,

analysis.

increased caspase-3 activity in a time-dependent manner. B, ECC-1
cells were treated with GnRH-II (100 nmol/L) for 24, 48, and 72 h.
Immunoblotting analysis showed increased caspase-3 activity in a
time-dependent manner. C, the effect of GnRH-II–induced apoptosis was

72 hours of treatment (Fig. 2C). These results revealed that GnRH-II
indeed induced apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells.
The effect of GnRH-II–induced apoptosis is mediated by
GnRH-I receptors in endometrial cancer cells. It is assumed
that both GnRH-I and GnRH-II exert their biological effects by
binding to a common GnRH-I receptor (8). To investigate whether
the effect of GnRH-II on apoptosis was mediated by GnRH-I
receptor, Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells were transfected with
GnRH-I receptor siRNA to knock down the endogenous GnRH-I
receptor. GnRH-II–induced apoptosis was examined by the MTT
assay and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was assessed by
immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, 24 hours of treatment
with 50 nmol/L GnRH-I receptor siRNA down-regulated GnRH-I
receptor expression in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells. Knockdown of endogenous GnRH-I receptor significantly rescued the
cells from GnRH-II–mediated cell growth inhibition (Fig. 3B) and
abolished GnRH-II–increased expression of cleaved caspase-3
(Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicated that GnRH-II–
induced apoptosis in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells was
mediated by GnRH-I receptors.
The effect of GnRH-II–induced apoptosis is mediated by
ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in endometrial cancer cells. To
investigate the molecular mechanism of GnRH-II–induced apoptosis on Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, the activation of ERK1/2

Figure 4. Effects of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling in
Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells. A, effects of GnRH-II
on ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation. Cells were treated
with GnRH-II (100 nmol/L) at different time points. The
phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and phosphorylated
p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK ) levels were analyzed by
immunoblot analysis and showed increases in the levels
of p-ERK1/2 and p-p38 MAPK following 5 min of
stimulation. B, effects of human si-GnRHR transfection
on GnRH-II–induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38
MAPK. The activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK
induced by GnRH-II was investigated after si-GnRHR
transfection, showing significant decreases in the levels
of p-ERK1/2 and p-p38 MAPK. C, effects of PD98059
(PD ) and SB203580 (SB ) pretreatment on type II GnRH–
induced ERK and p38 MAPK activation. Cells were
pretreated individually with 1 Amol/L PD98059 and 1
Amol/L SB203580 for 30 min, followed by stimulation with
100 nmol/L GnRH-II for 10 min. Control culture was
treated with DMSO as a vehicle control. The activation
of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was analyzed by immunoblot
analysis. Bottom, effects of PD98059 and SB203580
on GnRH-II–induced cell growth inhibition. Treatment
with GnRH-II (100 nmol/L) for 72 h resulted in a
significant decrease of cell growth. Pretreatment with
1 Amol/L PD98059 and 1 Amol/L SB203580 individually
attenuated the effects of GnRH-II–induced cell growth
inhibition. D, effects of PD98059 and SB203580 on
caspase-3 activity induced by GnRH-II in endometrial
cancer cells. The cells were pretreated with PD98059
(1 Amol/L) and SB203580 (1 Amol/L) for 30 min. Then,
the cells were treated with GnRH-II for 72 h. The
caspase-3 activity was determined by immunoblot
analysis. PD98059 and SB203580 abolished GnRH-II–
induced activation of caspase-3.

and p38 MAPK was examined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in
Fig. 4A, GnRH-II activated ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in a timedependent manner. The effects of GnRH-II on ERK1/2 and p38
MAPK activation were abolished by transfecting cells with GnRH-I
receptor siRNA, but not with control siRNA (Fig. 4B). To further
evaluate the roles of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in GnRH-II–induced
apoptosis, Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells were treated with
PD98059 and SB203580 plus GnRH-II. As shown in Fig. 4C, cells
pretreated with PD98059 and SB203580 abolished the activation of
ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK stimulated by GnRH-II and were rescued
from GnRH-II–mediated cell growth inhibition. Moreover, both
inhibitors abolished GnRH-II–induced expression of cleaved
caspase-3 (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that GnRH-II induced
apoptosis on Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells through activation
of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.
GnRH-II–induced GADD45A expression is mediated by
ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in endometrial cancer cells. GADD45a
was originally identified as a gene transcribed in response to DNA
damage by UV irradiation (21) and has been reported to be
involved in many biological functions, such as suppressing cell
growth (22), participating in DNA damage repair (23), and
mediating apoptotic signal pathways (24). To determine whether
GADD45a is involved in GnRH-II–induced apoptosis in Ishikawa
endometrial cancer cells, the cells were treated with GnRH-II and

www.aacrjournals.org

the GADD45a induction was detected by immunoblot analysis. As
shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with 100 nmol/L GnRH-II obviously
induced GADD45a expression in a time-dependent manner.
Experiments using the ECC-1 cancer cells gave similar results
(Fig. 5A). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous GnRH-I receptor
abolished GnRH-II–induced GADD45a expression (Fig. 5B). It was
more important to observe that this induction was blocked in
either PD98059 or SB203580 pretreated cells, indicating that ERK1/
2 and p38 MAPK were both critical for GADD45a up-regulation in
response to GnRH-II in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells (Fig. 5B).
GADD45A induction is essential for GnRH-II–induced
apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells. To elucidate the
importance of GADD45a in GnRH-II–induced apoptosis, we
applied siRNA technology to inhibit endogenous GADD45a
expression to determine whether blocking GADD45a expression
could affect the cellular apoptotic responses in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells. The MTT assay showed that GnRH-II–stimulated
cell growth inhibition was rescued by knockdown of endogenous
GADD45a (Fig. 5C). Ishikawa cells treated with GADD45asiRNA
were refractory to GnRH-II–induced activation of caspase-3
(Fig. 5D), suggesting that GADD45a is critical for GnRH-II–induced
apoptosis in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells. Taken together,
these data show that GnRH-II inhibits cell proliferation and
induces apoptosis of Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells by

activating GADD45a through GnRH-I receptors and the MAPK
signaling pathway (Fig. 6).

Discussion
GnRH is a key molecule of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal
axis in reproduction (25). Previous studies showed direct
antiproliferative effects of GnRH-I analogues in human endometrial cancer cells (4, 26). Furthermore, it has been shown that
GnRH-II had a more potent antiproliferative effect than GnRH-I in
endometrial cancer cells, suggesting that GnRH-II could be
considered as a possible therapy for endometrial cancers (4).
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms generated by
GnRH-II to induce the antiproliferation of endometrial cancer cells
are not well known. The GnRH-I receptor is a member of the GPCR
family. GPCRs are characterized by the presence of seven
transmembrane domains and transfer their signals through
multiple G protein subunits, often stimulating multiple signaling
pathways (27). Direct evidence showing the presence of a fulllength, functional GnRH-II receptor mRNA in human tissues is
insufficient, and the issue of whether the GnRH-I receptor mediates
the effects of both GnRH-I and GnRH-II remains unresolved.
In our previous study (2), the expression of GnRH-II and its
inhibitory effects on cell growth were shown in normal human
ovarian surface epithelium cells. It was further shown that GnRH-II
had a more efficient antiproliferative effect than GnRH-I in ovarian
and endometrial cancer cells (4). In the present study, treatment

with GnRH-II resulted in a significant antiproliferative effect in a
time- and dose-dependent manner in Ishikawa and ECC-1
endometrial cancer cells. These findings suggested that GnRH-II
directly induced the antiproliferative effects on the endometrial
cancer cells, indicating that the direct antiproliferative effects of
GnRH-II were confirmed in vitro.
In this study, GnRH-I receptor siRNA was exploited to selectively
knock down GnRH-I receptors in Ishikawa endometrial cancer
cells. Targeting GnRH-I receptors with siRNA significantly reduced
the protein expression of GnRH-I receptors by immunoblot
analysis, indicating that the translation of the GnRH-I receptor
was decreased in these cells. The proliferation of cells transfected
with siRNA was investigated by the MTT assay. Targeting GnRH-I
receptors with siRNA blocked the antiproliferative effects of GnRHII, indicating that the antiproliferative effect of GnRH-II on
endometrial cancer cells is dependent on GnRH-I receptors. This
finding confirmed the previous studies (28, 29) suggesting that
GnRH-I receptors may be a common receptor that mediates the
effects of both GnRH-I and GnRH-II in gynecologic cancer cell
lines.
Apoptosis in tumor cells has been widely shown as having a
critical role in regulating cell proliferation. Previous studies showed
that GnRH-II analogues induced apoptosis in many different cell
types (10, 30–32). To investigate whether GnRH-II induces
apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells, we performed the TUNEL
assay and detected the activity of caspase-3. Treatment with GnRHII resulted in increased TUNEL-positive cells and an increase of

cleaved caspase-3 activity was abolished following si-GADD45a transfection. h-Actin served as a loading control.

GnRH-II Induces Endometrial Cancer Apoposis by GADD45a

Figure 6. The proposed signaling pathways involved in GnRH-II–induced
GADD45a overexpression and apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells. GnRH-II
suppresses the growth of endometrial cancer cells by inducing apoptosis through
binding of GnRH-I receptors and activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK
pathways. The effect of GnRH-II on cell growth inhibition and apoptosis may
be mediated by the GADD45a signaling pathway.

caspase-3 activity, indicating that GnRH-II induced apoptosis in
endometrial cancer cells, probably through activation of the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The antiproliferative effects of
GnRH-II in endometrial cancer cells may be due to increased
apoptosis. Recently, Morgan and colleagues (33) reported that
GnRH agonists mediated the inhibition of cell growth by the
induction of apoptosis in different cells. This study also showed
that GnRH receptors and intracellular signaling play an important
role in the apoptotic process, contributing to the cell type–specific
effects of GnRH on growth.
MAPKs have been regarded as having essential roles in GnRHinduced signaling pathways in pituitary gonadotrope cells (9, 34).
MAPKs develop signaling pathways that mediate cellular responses
to different extracellular stimuli, thereby determining the cell fate.
As we previously reported (10, 11), ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK are
involved in the GnRH-II–induced inhibition of cell growth and the
induction of apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. In the present study,
we observed that GnRH-II (100 nmol/L) activated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in Ishikawa endometrial cancer
cells, which is compatible with a previous study done in COS-7 cells
(6). Moreover, the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was
markedly attenuated by PD98059 and SB203580 in Ishikawa
endometrial cancer cells. These data are compatible with previous
studies that showed that GnRH-I induced the activation of ERK1/2
and p38 MAPK in pituitary cell lines (35, 36). The present results
indicate that the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways might play an
important role in the signaling pathway mediating the effects of
GnRH-II in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells. Treatment with
PD98059 and SB203580 attenuated the antiproliferative effects of
GnRH-II, further indicating that GnRH-II–induced activation of

ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK may have an important role in the
regulation of cell proliferation in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells.
Apoptosis in cancer cells has been well known as an important
process in regulating cell proliferation. The activation of caspase-3
induced by GnRH-II was abolished by PD98059 and SB203580
pretreatment, suggesting that the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling
pathways have an important role in GnRH-II–induced apoptosis in
Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells. Therefore, attempts to manipulate the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling that mediates the
regulation of cell growth and apoptosis may be an approach to
enhance the effects of GnRH-II treatment in endometrial cancer.
Although several studies have shown that GnRH-II inhibits the
proliferation of human cells (37, 38), the exact molecular
mechanisms responsible for the effects are incompletely understood. Increased expression of GADD45 family genes is frequently
observed in response to agents that inhibit proliferation or
promote apoptosis. GADD45a has a direct role in the regulation
of signaling pathways, genomic stability, and apoptosis (39, 40).
Recent studies have shown that GADD45a is stimulated by agents
that induce apoptosis in human tumor cells (16, 41). In
determining GADD45a expression in endometrial cancer cells,
treatment with GnRH-II increased the protein expression of
GADD45a in a time-dependent manner, indicating that GADD45a
may have a role in the GnRH-II–induced growth inhibition of
endometrial cancer cells and apoptosis. Pretreatment with
PD98059 and SB203580 abolished the protein expression of
GADD45a induced by GnRH-II, suggesting that the ERK1/2 and
p38 MAPK signaling pathways may play an important role in
regulating GADD45a expression. Taken together with the previous
results, the induction of GADD45a by GnRH-II was accompanied
by activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways to
regulate GnRH-II–induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in
endometrial cancer cells. This is the first demonstration that
GnRH-II induces apoptosis through the activation of GADD45a.
In aggregate, our data show that GADD45a is close to the
pathways of the MAPKs involved in GnRH-II–induced apoptosis in
endometrial cancer cells. Targeting GADD45a with siRNA blocked
the antiproliferative effects of GnRH-II, indicating that the
antiproliferative effect of GnRH-II in endometrial cancer cells is
highly related to GADD45a expression. GADD45a knockdown
attenuated GnRH-II–induced apoptosis, indicating that GnRH-II
triggered the apoptosis of endometrial cancer cells through a
GADD45a-dependent pathway. GADD45a interacts with several
intracellular signaling molecules that are involved in the control of
DNA damage, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis
(42). In the present study, GADD45a increases in response to
GnRH-II treatment in endometrial cancer cells may mediate
antiproliferation and apoptosis through the ERK1/2 and p38
MAPK signaling pathways.
An enhanced understanding of the mechanism of effects of
GnRH-II on antiproliferation and apoptosis is critical to the
development of efficient therapies for endometrial cancer.
Considering the role of GnRH receptor in the antiproliferative
effects of GnRH-II proved in this study, we further elucidated the
role of GnRH-I receptor in the signaling pathway involved in
GnRH-II–induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells. Using siRNA to knock down GnRH-I receptors
expression, immunoblot analysis revealed that the activity of
caspase-3 was significantly reduced in siRNA-transfected cells,
showing that the apoptosis induced by GnRH-II may depend on
GnRH-I receptors. Additionally, GnRH-I receptor knockdown also

attenuated GnRH-II–induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK,
suggesting that GnRH-II stimulates the activation of ERK1/2 and
p38 MAPK through GnRH-I receptors. Furthermore, silencing of
GnRH-I receptors abolished GnRH-II–induced GADD45a expression, indicating that GnRH-I receptor is responsible for the
observed GADD45a activation in response to GnRH-II in
endometrial cancer cells. Taken together, we show for the first
time that GnRH-II increased the expression of GADD45a through
GnRH-I receptors in endoemtrial cancer cells.
In conclusion, this study suggests that GnRH-II suppresses the
growth of endometrial cancer cells by inducing apoptosis through
the binding of GnRH-I receptors, activation of the ERK1/2 and p38
MAPK pathways, and induction of GADD45a signaling. Our
findings may provide a new insight on the mechanisms of GnRHII–induced antiproliferation and apoptotic effects in endometrial
