ABSTRACT
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are a class of small-molecule
drugs suppressing PARP enzymes activity, inducing the death of cells deficient in
homologous recombination repair (HRR). HRR deficiency is common in tumor cells
with BRCA gene mutation. Since their first clinical trial in 2003, PARP inhibitors have
shown benefit in the treatment of HRR-deficient tumors. Recently, several randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted to investigate the potential benefit of
administration of PARP inhibitors in cancer patients. However, the results remain
controversial. To evaluate the efficiency and safety of PARP inhibitors in patients
with cancer, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of RCTs. According to
our study, PARP inhibitors could clearly improve progression-free survival (PFS),
especially in patients with BRCA mutation. However, our study showed no significant
difference in overall survival (OS) between the PARP inhibitors and controls, even
in the BRCA mutation group. Little toxicity was reported in the rate of treatment
correlated adverse events (AEs) in PARP inhibitor group compared with controls. In
conclusion, PARP inhibitors do well in improving PFS with little toxicity, especially in
patients with BRCA deficiency.

that inhibition of PARP may provide a novel strategy
for cancer therapy.
Genomic instability accompanied with elevated DNA
damage response is one of the most common features of
human cancers [6], while Double strand breaks (DSBs) are
the most severe type of DNA damage. DSBs are repaired
mainly through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and
homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways, which
two play complementary roles [7]. PARP1-dependent
end-joining (PARP-EJ) is a backup NHEJ repair pathway;
when NHEJ is defective, PARP1-EJ pathway is activated
[8, 9]. PARP inhibitors (such as Olaparib, Iniparib, Veliparib,
Rucaparib, and Niraparib), a class of small-molecule drugs
inhibiting PARP enzymes, can induce synthetic lethality

INTRODUCTION
The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs)
are a family of enzymes comprising 18 members, and
they play a vital role in maintaining the stability of the
genome [1]. Among them, PARP-1 and PARP-2 are best
known for their contribution to DNA damage repair.
PARP-1, which was first found ~50 years ago, is activated
by DNA damage and plays a crucial role in the repair of
single-strand breaks [2]. Another family member, PARP-2,
has 69% structural similarity to PARP-1, and some of their
functions overlap [3]. Evidence demonstrates that PARP
is significantly increased in some cancer types, compared
with adjacent non-tumorous tissues [4, 5]. This suggests

in HRR deficiency cancer cells [10]. HRR deficiency
is common in tumor cells, for example with BRCA gene
mutations. In vitro experiments have established that cells
with defective HRR are killed by PARP inhibitors [11]. Since
their first clinical trial in 2003 [12], PARP inhibitors have
shown benefit in the treatment of HRR-deficient tumors.
Many kinds of PARP inhibitors have been designed since
then; for example, Olaparib has been clinically approved for
use in human testing by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in the USA.
However, on the other hand, serious adverse events
have been reported in the PARP inhibitor arms of some
clinical trials, and the therapeutic effect also seemed to
be unsatisfactory [13, 14]. Since their appearance, PARP
inhibitors have attracted controversy as to whether they are
effective and safe anti-tumor agents. Thus, we set out to
make a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) to gain insight relative risks and
benefits of PARP inhibitors in patients with cancer.

mutation status was known in 3 trials, and pooled results
showed a HR of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.11–0.94); 6 trials on BRCA
status unknown or non-mutation subgroup, the HR was 0.78
(95% CI, 0.65–0.95) (Table 2). 4 trials provided data on
Iniparib and 3 trials on Olaparib. For Iniparib, no significant
difference was observed between experiment group and
control group (HR, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.68–1.02) (Table 2). For
Olaparib, a significant improvement in PFS was recorded
in the Olaparib group compared with the control group
(HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–0.80) (Table 2). In the subgroup
analysis by cancer type, 2 trials concerning lung cancer,
and they gave a HR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.83–1.15); 3 trials on
ovarian cancer, the HR of PFS was 0.50 (95%CI, 0.32–0.80);
2 trials about breast cancer, and they gave a HR of 0.72 (95%
CI, 0.56–0.94) (Table 2).
Overall survival rates
Our meta-analysis showed no significant difference
in overall survival rates between the PARP inhibitor and
placebo arms in the overall population (HR, 0.92; 95%
CI, 0.79–1.08) (Figure 3). In the BRCA mutation group,
the HR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.57–1.23); and in the BRCA
status unknown or non-mutation subgroup, the HR was
0.89 (95% CI, 0.73–1.09) (Table 2). Olaparib showed
no statistical difference in overall survival rates, with an
HR of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.78–1.25), compared with controls
group; Similar results was observed in the Iniparib group
(HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67–1.10) (Table 2). In addition,
compared with control group, PARP inhibitors showed no
statistically significant difference in improving the overall
survival (OS) of patients with ovarian (HR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.78–1.25), breast (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.49–1.12), or lung
cancer (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76–1.31) (Table 2).

RESULTS
Literature search
We initially identified 2180 potentially eligible
studies by title and abstract screening. However, 2054
were excluded as they were not relevant to our analysis,
leaving 126 articles for full review. After assessing the
full texts of these potentially relevant studies, 115 were
excluded for the following reasons: 14 contained no
relative outcomes; 88 were phase I or single-arm phase II
trials; 12 were duplicate publication; and 1 used PARP
inhibitors in both the experimental and control groups.
Ultimately, 11 eligible RCTs [15–25] involving a total of
2274 patients were included for analyses. A flow diagram
of the trial selection process is shown in Figure 1. One
article (OZA, 2013) [25] from EMBASE was partly
overlapped with a previous publication (OZA 2015) [15],
but it provided elaborated progression-free survival (PFS)
data on the BRCA status, which was not mentioned in
previous article, so it was also included.
Of all 11 RCTs, 4 were BRCA mutation-correlated;
6 used the PARP inhibitor Olaparib, 4 used Iniparib, and
1 used Veliparib; 4 were about ovarian cancer, 2 about
lung cancer, 2 about breast cancer, 1 about gastric
cancer, 1 about pancreatic cancer, and 1 about ovarian,
peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers. The characteristics
of 11 included trials are presented in Table 1.

Safety
To evaluate the safety of PARP inhibitors, we
analyzed the risk factor of any side-effects in the overall
population with Grade 3 (G3) or more serious adverse
events (AEs). Furthermore, since two PARP inhibitors
were mainly used in the RCTs, we also evaluated the
safety of the Iniparib and Olaparib subgroups separately.
Analysis of patients in the overall population
showed that, compared with the control arms, PARP
inhibitors were associated with a decreased risk of
asthenia (RR, 0.34; 95%CI, 0.14–0.82) but increased
risk of neutropenia (RR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.01–1.29). In
our study, we did not find any association between PARP
inhibitors and other AEs (Table 3). In addtion, there were
no significant differences in the AEs in the Olaparib or
Iniparib subgroup (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

Outcomes
Progression-free survival
7 trials reported PFS of the overall population.
Overall, PFS was significantly longer in the PARP inhibitors
group than in the control group [Hazard ratio (HR), 0.67;
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.50–0.90] (Figure 2). BRCA

Arrangement of data points did not reveal any evidence
of obvious asymmetry. This was further confirmed
by Egger’s linear regression asymmetry test for each
outcome and the results still did not show any evidence of
publication bias (PFS: t = −1.24, P = 0.271; OS: t = −1.30,
P = 0.251) (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).

cancer treatment in the future? According to our study,
PARP inhibitors do well in prolonging the PFS of cancer
patients, despite of some reported adverse events.
In our study, PARP inhibitors significantly improved
the PFS in the overall population (HR, 0.67; 95% CI,
0.50–0.90), while the overall HR of the BRCA status
unknown or non-mutation group was a little higher (HR,
0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.95). However, the difference was
greater in the BRCA mutation group (HR, 0.32; 95%
CI, 0.11–0.94). There is no doubt that BRCA mutation
made a major contribution to the improved results.
Individuals with BRCA mutation are at an increased risk
of developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers [34].
More than 1 million women develop breast or ovarian
cancer every year worldwide, and about 10% of them have
a BRCA mutation [35–37], moreover that cancer patients
with BRCA mutation have better outcomes than nonBRCA carriers [38, 39]. And a recent study [40] suggested
that BRCA mutation should be taken into account when
devising therapeutic strategies. BRCA plays a vital role
in DNA damage repair by the HRR process, while PARP
enzymes are involved in crucial complementary repair
process [41]. With BRCA mutation, cancer cells are
unable to perform HRR efficiently [42], then PARP in turn
plays a major role in repairing damaged DNA to maintain
cell survival. Thus, PARP could be targeted for treating

DISCUSSION
To our best knowledge, this study is the first
systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the
efficiency and safety of the novel antitumor PARP
inhibitors. In our study, all RCTs included were published
from 2011 to 2015, which reflects the popularity of PARP
inhibitors in the past few years. Of all the 2274 patients,
several types of cancers were reported, such as ovarian,
lung, breast, and gastric cancers. Besides these, many
trials [26–32] in different kinds of cancers not eligible for
inclusion are still under way. Although the results have
not come out, it is possible that PARP inhibitors may work
in patients against some certain types of tumors. Various
inhibitors suppressing PARP enzymes were involved in
this study, including Olaparib, Iniparib, and Veliparib. It
is worth noting that Olaparib was recently approved for
use in human testing by the FDA in 2014 [33]. Will PARP
inhibitors be a powerful and safe strategy for personalized

BRCA-mutant tumors using a synthetic lethal approach.
In this analysis, PARP inhibitors appeared to be efficient
in killing BRCA-deficient cancer cells and prolonging
the PFS of patients, mainly due to suppression of PARP
enzyme activity [43].
Since PARP inhibitors have emerged as promising
antitumor drugs, many efforts have been made to develop
compounds such as Olaparib, Iniparib, Veliparib, and
others as antineoplastic agents [44]. In our study, the main
PARP inhibitors included were Olaparib and Iniparib.
Olaparib has already shown benefit in treating patients
with BRCA mutation, and our results confirmed that
again, with an overall HR of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.32–0.80)
between the Olaparib and control arms. Although Iniparib
had a tendency to improve the PFS, the difference did
not reach a statistically significant. The mechanism of
action of Iniparib seems not to be closely correlated to
PARP enzymes, it was reported that Iniparib carries a
carboxyl group swiveled around an amino bond, and this
may weakens its ability to bind PARP [45]. Although
in the four trials with Iniparib it was combined with
gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin, data [46] have
already revealed that Iniparib fails to sensitize cells to
cisplatin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. We suppose that one
possibility of the difference, caused between the Iniparib
and Olaparib subgroups, may be different criteria of
patient enrolment. Patients enrolled in the Olaparib trials
mostly had BRCA mutations, while those in the Iniparib
subgroup mainly had non-mutation BRCA status. It should
also be noted that an initial submission of Olaparib to
FDA was rejected. The application was only accepted
following addition data provided to support that benefit
was restricted to the BRCA mutated patients.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Soon after their development, PARP inhibitors were
used in hundreds of clinical trials, and many different kinds
of tumors with or without BRCA mutation were involved
[47]. For example, Olaparib was reported to be effective
against several tumor types including ovarian, breast,
pancreatic, and prostate cancers [48]. The main tumor
types included in our study were ovarian, breast, and lung
cancers. According to our results, there was significant
statistical heterogeneity in the PFS of the ovarian cancer
subgroup (HR, 0.50; 95%CI, 0.32–0.80), while in the lung
(HR, 0.98; 95%CI, 0.83–1.15) and breast cancer groups
(HR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.56–0.94), there seemed to be no odds
difference between the PARP inhibitor and control arms.
As far as we know, various PARP inhibitors were designed
to suppress tumors with BRCA mutation, no matter what
kind of cancer. Thus, the reason may be that most of the
patients in the ovarian cancer group had BRCA mutation,
while those in lung and breast cancer subgroups did not.
The results would be better if the patients in lung and
breast cancer group were also with BRCA mutation as
those in ovarian cancer group.
Consistent with previous hypothesis, our study show
that cancer patients with BRCA mutation may increase
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors [49]. PARP inhibitors can
induce synthetic lethality in HRR deficient cancer cells,
such as BRCA dysfunction [50]. BRCA mutation was at a
high prevalence among breast cancer patients. About 20%
of breast cancer patients were BRCA mutations carriers
[51, 52]. Beyond breast cancer, several other malignancies,
including ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and
prostate cancer, were also correlated to BRCA mutations
[53]. On top of BRCA, mutations of other DNA repair genes,
such as RAD51, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, may also increase

sensitivity to PARP inhibitors [54]. It is therefore important
to perform genetic testing and in prior to this therapy.
However, PAPR inhibitors failed to improve the OS
of cancer patients in this analysis. Apart from the overall
level, we also analyzed the OS from the perspective of
cancer type, PARP inhibitor category, and BRCA status.
According to our analysis, other than the OS of the
Iniparib subgroup, none of the results showed significant
differences between the PARP inhibitor and control
arms. And even the result in the Iniparib subgroup was
not satisfactory, with an HR of 0.86 (95%CI, 0.67–1.10).
Although PARP inhibitors did not statistically improve the
OS, in some individual trials, they were reported to clearly
increase it. For example, Novello et al17 reported that the
median OS in the PARP inhibitor arm was 12 months
compared with 8.5 months in the control arm; and in
another trial20, the OS was prolonged from 7.7 months
to 12.3 months by PARP inhibitors. Research on PARP
inhibitors is still ongoing, and many aspects need further
improvement. Also, the inherent relationship between
PFS and OS should be taken into account, since PFS
is contained within OS. PARP inhibitors may be able
to effectively improve the PFS, but this was not strong
enough to translate PFS effects into OS improvement.
Today, many traditional anti-cancer drugs are able to
kill tumor cells, but their toxicity to normal cells restricts
their clinical application. PARP inhibitors suppress DNA
repair, and kill cancer cells through “synthetic lethality”
[55]. In this way, PARP inhibitors are applicable across
various cancers, improving the efficacy and reducing the
toxicity of individualized therapies. Our study revealed the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

benefit of the low toxicity of PARP inhibitors. Compared
with the control arms, no treatment-correlated risks
were seen in the Iniparib and Olaparib subgroups. Only
a slightly decreased risk of asthenia (RR, 0.34; 95% CI,
0.14–0.82) and increased risk of neutropenia (RR, 1.14;
95% CI, 1.01–1.29) were seen in the overall population,
suggesting that the PARP inhibitors are well-tolerated.
In conclusion, based on the available observational
studies, PARP inhibitors do better in improving PFS with
little toxicity, especially in patients with BRCA deficiency.
However, they fail to increase the OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study selection
We carried out a comprehensive search to
identify potential articles in PUBMED and EMBASE
up to January 2015, using the search terms: “PARP
inhibitors” or “Olaparib” or “Iniparib” or “Veliparib”
or “Rucaparib” or “Niraparib” or “Talazoparib” and
“cancer” or “tumor” or “carcinoma”, limited to clinical
trials. There was no limit on the language of publication.
In order to ensure the completeness and quality of the
results, relevant scientific meetings were retrieved, and
unpublished trials were checked in the clinical trial
registry (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).
To be included, studies had to be RCTs and had
to report at least one outcome of interest, such as PFS,
OS, and AEs. Single-arm trials and trials in which PARP
inhibitors were used in both arms were excluded, on

Statistical analysis

account of the absence of control groups. Trials in which
PARP inhibitors were used to treat other diseases were also
excluded. In all the included RCTs, PARP inhibitors were
used alone or combination with other chemotherapeutic
agents as the treatment group, while in the control group
placebo or other chemotherapeutic agents were used.
Two investigators reviewed the articles independently to
exclude irrelevant and overlapping studies.

All analyses were done with Stata version
12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) and Review
Manager (version 5.1, The Cochrane Collaboration,
Oxford, UK). A 2-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was
judged as statistically significant. HR and 95% CI were
used to assess the OS and PFS between PARP inhibitors
group and control group. In addition, we extracted
dichotomous data form all studies reporting number
of patients with adverse events and total participants
and pooled them to calculate RR with 95% CI. The
degree of heterogeneity was measured by the I2 statistic,
with I2  <  25%, 25–75% and > 75% to represent low,
moderate and high degree of inconsistency, respectively
[56]. Statistical heterogeneity was defined as an
I2 statistic value of more than 50% [56]. In analyses, if
the heterogeneity was low then we used a fixed-effect
model, or else applied the random-effect model. We
further performed a subgroup analysis by the status

Data extraction
We collected the following information from all the
included RCTs: first author’s surname, year of publication,
number of participants, histology, trial phase, treatment
arm, median age, BRCA status, median OS, and median
PFS. In addition, the HR of the median OS and median
PFS with 95% CIs were extracted from most of the
trials to evaluate the curative effect of PARP inhibitors.
Information on AEs was also retrieved to calculate the
safety of PARP inhibitors.
