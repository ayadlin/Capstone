Abstract
The effects of antiangiogenic therapy on tumors relapsing
after irradiation are not known. To this end, we irradiated
human tumors growing s.c. in nude mice with a single dose
of 20 or 30 Gy. Compared with primary (treatment-naive)
xenografts, the growth rate of recurrent tumors was 1.6-fold
slower, which is consistent with the known ‘‘tumor bed effect.’’
For similar size tumors, recurrences had fewer functional
vessels, a reduced vessel coverage by perivascular cells, and
were more necrotic. Placenta growth factor concentration was
significantly lower in relapses, whereas vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) levels were similar between primary and
recurrent tumors. On the other hand, fibrillar collagen
deposition was significantly increased in recurrent tumors.
This radiation-induced fibrosis was partially responsible
for the slower growth of recurrences; the i.t. injection of
collagenase increased the growth rate of tumor relapses
without affecting primary tumor growth. The mouse-specific
VEGF receptor 2–blocking antibody DC101 induced a 2.2-fold
longer growth delay in recurrent tumors compared with
treatment-naive tumors. DC101 significantly decreased the
interstitial fluid pressure and did not change the functional
vessel density and perivascular cell coverage in both tumor
variants. Interestingly, DC101 induced a rapid (2 days after
treatment initiation) and significant decrease in tumor cell
proliferation in recurrent but not in primary tumors. Thus,
our results show that the stromal compartment and the
response to antiangionenic therapy of primary and in-field
recurrent tumors are significantly different. Our findings
suggest that antiangiogenic agents could be effective in
the treatment of patients with relapses after radiotherapy.

Introduction
The treatment of tumor recurrences after radiotherapy is a
challenging problem. Although extensively studied in animals with
untreated tumors, the effect of antiangiogenic agents on recurrent
tumors following irradiation has not been evaluated in preclinical
studies. To fill this gap in our knowledge, ‘‘primary’’ (treatment-

naive) and ‘‘recurrent/relapsed’’ (previously irradiated) human
tumor xenografts were treated with anti–vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) therapy. We hypothesized that
tumors relapsing after irradiation may respond better to antiangiogenic therapy because (a) the slow growth observed in
recurrent tumors is typically associated with angiogenesis defects
(1–4), and (b) slowly growing, poorly vascularized tumors are
potentially more susceptible to antiangiogenic therapy (5, 6).
Other studies have generally used tumors produced by the
implantation of nonirradiated cancer cells into preirradiated
normal tissue as a model of recurrent tumor growth; our model
is a closer representation of clinical recurrences because we
irradiated neoplastic cells, tumor vessels, and other stromal
components. We show that the blockade of mouse VEGFR2 with
the DC101 monoclonal antibody is therapeutically more effective
against radiation recurrences; this is presumably related to
significant differences between the vasculature and microenvironment of recurrent versus treatment-naive tumors.

Materials and Methods
Tumor implantation and irradiation. As in our previous study (7), the
human lung tumor 54A was implanted s.c. into the calf area of the right
hind leg of athymic NCr/Sed nude (nu/nu) mice. At a size of 6 mm in
diameter, tumors were locally g-irradiated with a single dose of 20 or 30 Gy
(at a dose rate of f5 Gy/min), whereas tumors in the control group were
not irradiated. A schematic representation of the experimental protocol is
represented in Fig. 1A.
DC101 and collagenase treatments and evaluation of tumor
response to therapy. Once treatment-naive and recurrent tumors reached
a diameter of 8 mm (the corresponding volume f260 mm3 is designated as
V o), they were treated with the monoclonal antibody DC101 or collagenase.
Three i.p. injections of DC101 (ImClone Systems, Inc.) were given every
3 days at 27 mg/kg (Fig. 1A). DC101 specifically blocks the signaling of
mouse VEGFR2/Flk-1 and does not cross-react with human VEGFR2/KDR
or mouse and human VEGFR1 (8). Collagenase (clostridiopeptidase A,
Sigma) was administered i.t. (50 Ag/mL in PBS, two injections of 20 AL each
per tumor) thrice every 2 days. Tumor size was measured thrice per week.
The time taken for a tumor to double or triple its initial volume V o was
determined.
Tumor histology and immunohistochemistry. To identify perfuse
vessels, 0.1 mL of biotinylated tomato lectin (Vector Laboratories) was
injected i.v. and 5 min later the mice were sacrificed. The excised tumors
were formalin fixed, embedded in paraffin, and 5-Am sections were cut. To
colocalize the biotinylated lectin and perivascular cells in the same section,
the staining was done with a streptavidin-conjugated fluorochrome (Alexa
647, Molecular Probes, Inc.) and a Cy3-conjugated mouse monoclonal
antibody against a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA; clone 1A4, Sigma).
Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling staining for apoptosis and Ki67 for tumor cell proliferation were
done as previously described (9). To determine the collagen content in

tumors, sections were stained with Masson trichrome. Images were
captured using either an Olympus confocal or bright-field microscope
and then processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems,
Inc.) and/or the NIH Image 1.63 software. A macro within the NIH Image
1.63 software was used to calculate the colocalization of aSMA-positive cells
with perfused vessels. To quantify necrosis, we superimposed an electronic
grid of small squares on randomly sampled images. The percentage of
necrosis was obtained by dividing the number of squares associated with
necrotic areas by the total number of squares.
Expression of angiogenesis-related molecules in tumors. Primary
and recurrent tumors of 8 mm in diameter (n = 6) were snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen and collected at 80jC. Tumors were grinded in liquid
nitrogen and pooled aliquots of the samples were first used to measure

mRNA expression (the remaining material was again stored at 80jC and
used later for protein analysis). Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). To screen for relative gene expression, we used cDNA
gene chips containing 96 human or mouse genes related to angiogenesis
and vessel maturation (GEArray Q Series, SuperArray) and quantified
chemiluminiscent spots on membranes by densitometry (FluoroChem
800 system, Alpha Innotech). The relative abundance of a transcript was
normalized to h-actin. Protein extraction from the stored material was
done using NET buffer. Total protein concentrations were determined in
individual samples by the Standard Lowry Method (Bio-Rad detergentcompatible protein assay). Human and mouse VEGF and human placental
growth factor (PlGF) were measured by ELISA (the Quantikine Immunoassays, R&D Systems, Inc.).

Results and Discussion
Recurrent tumors are more sensitive to DC101 than
treatment-naive tumors. Following a minor increase in size over
the first days after irradiation at 6 mm, apparent tumor dimensions
remained almost unchanged after 20 Gy and slowly decreased by
1 to 2 mm after 30 Gy. Regardless of the dose, when the tumors
relapsed, they reached 8 mm in diameter (the point of DC101
treatment initiation) at a stabilized growth rate. The mean time
(F SD) between tumor irradiation and regrowth to 8 mm was
20.3 F 4.2 and 35.9 F 6.1 days following 20 and 30 Gy, respectively;
treatment-naive tumors grew from 6 to 8 mm typically in 4 to
5 days (Fig. 1A).
Figure 1B shows that after 20 Gy, the time needed to double and
triple tumor volume V o increased 1.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively.
The same sluggish growth was observed for tumors recurring after
30 Gy (n = 9; data not shown). Our tumor growth results are similar
to the experimental findings of other studies and consistent with
the classic tumor bed effect, which usually reaches saturation at
f20 Gy (2). The doses and schedules of fractionated irradiation
commonly used in the clinic may be as effective in inducing the
tumor bed effect as the 20-Gy single irradiation dose used in the
present study (2).
During DC101 therapy, the growth of primary tumors was only
modestly inhibited whereas it was completely arrested in most
tumors recurring after 20 Gy, with an occasional decrease in size

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

(Fig. 1B). After DC101 treatment, primary tumors immediately
started to grow at a rate indistinguishable from nonirradiated
controls. In contrast, several recurrent tumors remained dormant
for a certain period of time following the last antibody injection,
although they eventually regrew at approximately the same rate as
control relapses. The tumor growth delay induced by DC101 (the
difference between DC101-treated and untreated groups) was
significantly longer in recurrent than primary tumors at both 2V o
(P < 0.001) and 3Vo (P < 0.01). Because primary and recurrent
tumors grew at different rates, we also calculated the mean specific
tumor growth delay induced by DC101 (normalized to the tumor
doubling times of the corresponding controls), which was 40%
greater in recurrences. Figure 1C shows the individual tumor
volume doubling times for the four experimental groups. For the
19 recurrent tumors treated with DC101, 3 tumors were relatively
resistant and 6 tumors were especially sensitive (including 2
tumors that were locally controlled for 120 days). The individual
variability within groups was greater for the relapsed tumors,
especially in the case of DC101 treatment (increased intertumor
variabilities of certain growth parameters were also noticed for
tumors implanted in preirradiated sites; refs. 2, 12). The effects of
DC101 on tumor growth parameters were similar when the 30-Gy
dose was used for tumor irradiation instead of 20 Gy (n = 8; data
not shown).
Collectively, our results indicate that DC101 induces a greater
growth retardation in recurrent than primary 54A tumor
xenografts. Although antiangiogenic agents are often used in
combination with radiation, the present data are the first evidence
of highly effective antiangiogenic therapy of post-radiation
recurrences. Probably closest to our findings is the recent study
of Zips et al. (13); they showed that tumors implanted in normal
tissue 10 days after its irradiation were sensitive to the VEGFR2
inhibitor PTK787/ZK222584 at an initial stage of growth, whereas
control tumors growing in nonirradiated tissue were not. The
greater antitumor effect of DC101 on radiation recurrences
occurred after a relatively short period of antibody administration. Therefore, greater benefits may be expected from a longer

administration of antiangiogenic agents. In fact, we have recently
shown in a phase 2 study that AZD2171, a pan-VEGF receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tended to increase median overall survival time in comparison with a historical database and significantly
alleviated edema in recurrent glioblastoma patients (14), although
no comparison with AZD2171 effects in newly diagnosed glioblastomas was studied.
The decrease in functional vascular density in recurrent
tumors is associated with less mature vessels and a reduction
in PlGF concentration. Presumably distinctive, the characteristics
of tumors regrowing after irradiation have been virtually unexplored. Table 1 shows that the percentage of necrotic area was
significantly increased in relapsed versus primary 54A tumors,
whereas the fractions of proliferating and apoptotic tumor cells
were not significantly different. A strong trend for a lower
functional vessel density was also found in recurrent tumors. Our
findings are similar to results obtained for tumors growing in
preirradiated normal tissue, wherein a slower growth rate has been
associated with a reduced vascular density and increased necrotic
loss of nonirradiated cancer cells at a constant proliferation rate
(4, 12, 15, 16).
Although the perfused vessel density was approximately proportional to the viable tumor parenchyma in both tumor types,
in recurrent tumors vessel coverage by perivascular cells significantly decreased by 44% (Table 1). This novel finding for radiation
recurrences may be consistent with a decrease in vessel maturation
observed in tumor xenografts shortly before their apparent
regrowth following radioimmunotherapy (17).

To determine if differences in the vasculature of primary and
recurrent tumors were related to the expression of angiogenesisrelated genes, we used human- and mouse-specific angiogenic gene
arrays. Except for human PlGF expression, which was downregulated by 2.7-fold in relapsed xenografts, the expression of other
genes did not change by more than 2-fold. In agreement with gene
array results, human and mouse VEGF protein levels were not
different between primary and recurrent tumors whereas the
human PlGF concentration was 1.64-fold lower in recurrences
(Table 1). The reduction in PlGF concentration could affect the
density and maturation of blood vessels and decrease the growth
rate of radiation recurrences. PlGF, a specific ligand of VEGFR1, can
potentiate the angiogenic effects of VEGF, enhance the survival of
tumor-associated endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages,
and stimulate the recruitment of perivascular cells and vessel
stabilization (18–20).
Collagenase accelerates the growth of recurrent tumors. We
have shown that the tumor collagen content (collagen type I)
significantly increased at an early time point (5 days) after
irradiation doses of 10 and 30 Gy (21). In the present study, the
quantitative evaluation of the Masson staining revealed a 3.3-fold
higher fraction of tissue occupied by collagen in recurrent than
primary tumors of the same size (Fig. 2A; Table 1). The increased
collagen content observed in recurrent tumors is also consistent
with normal tissue fibrosis after radiotherapy (22, 23); however,
to our knowledge, collagen levels have not been previously reported
for recurrent tumors or tumors growing in preirradiated normal
tissues.

Cancer Research

Based on in vitro studies showing that collagen inhibits the
growth of tumor cells and spheroids (24, 25), we assumed that the
increased collagen deposition in recurrent tumors retarded their
growth. To test this hypothesis, similar to our previous studies, we
injected bacterial collagenase i.t. to degrade collagen fibers (26, 27).
Collagenase did not change the growth of primary tumors but the
growth rate of recurrent tumors was partially restored (Fig. 2B).
Thus, radiation-induced accumulation of collagen affected the
growth rate of recurrent tumors without altering tumor cell
proliferation (Table 1).
DC101 does not affect the vessel density or perivascular cell
coverage but reduces the tumor IFP in both primary and
recurrent tumors. The analysis of the vasculature showed that, in
both tumor types, the DC101-induced growth inhibition was not
associated with parallel changes in the density of perfused vessels
(Fig. 3A) or vessel perimeter covered by aSMA-positive perivascular
cells (Fig. 3B). At the early time points studied (2 and 8 days after the
initiation of DC101 treatment), the vasculature of primary and even
recurrent (with less vessel coverage by perivascular cells) tumors
was relatively more resistant to DC101 than the vasculature of other
tumor types treated with similar or higher doses of DC101 (28–30).
However, consistent with our findings, in a model of colon carcinomatosis, Shaheen et al. (31) found no change in total vessel density
after multiple injections of DC101 over a period of 2 weeks, but the
number of vessels decreased at later time points. Our findings also
provide an additional example of the lack of correlation between
changes in microvessel density during antiangiogenic treatment
and alterations in tumor growth (6, 29).
Although there was no change in the functional vascular density in
both tumor models (Fig. 3A), it is quite possible that DC101 affected

angiogenesis preferentially in recurrent tumors. DC101 immediately
arrested the growth of relapses (Figs. 1B and 3D), suggesting that
their neovascularization was almost completely inhibited. In
contrast, primary tumors continued to grow, only slower (Fig. 1B),
which implies that the formation of new vessels was still active.
To determine if DC101 could affect the vascular function in 54A
tumor xenografts, we measured the tumor IFP, a reliable surrogate
marker of changes in tumor vascular permeability induced by the
inhibition of VEGF signaling. We have shown that DC101 reduces
the tumor vascular permeability and the transfer of plasma
proteins to the interstitial space, thus reducing fluid accumulation
and the tumor IFP (32). To our knowledge, the IFP has not been
compared between primary and recurrent tumors. The mean
baseline IFP was virtually identical in the two tumor variants
(Table 1; Fig. 3C). DC101 induced a significant reduction in IFP in
both primary and recurrent 54A tumors (Fig. 3C), thus suggesting a
reduction of their vessel permeability as well.
DC101 selectively reduces the tumor cell proliferation in
recurrent tumors. We also related the effects of DC101 on
tumor growth to secondary effects on tumor cells (DC101 is highly
specific for mouse VEGFR2; ref. 8). Compared with the corresponding controls (day 0), DC101 increased necrosis in primary
and recurrent tumors (Fig. 4A) whereas neoplastic cell apoptosis
was not significantly changed in both tumor models (data not
shown). Figure 4B shows that DC101 had no more than a tendency
to decrease cancer cell proliferation in the viable areas of primary
tumors. In contrast, in recurrent tumors, DC101 induced a 55%
reduction in tumor cell proliferation on day 2 versus day 0
(P < 0.05). In addition, there were significantly less proliferating cells
in recurrent than primary tumors on days 2 and 8 (Fig. 4B). The

rapid decrease in proliferation (after a single injection of DC101)
in recurrent tumors is intriguing, given that in the present study and
other studies (29, 31), the treatment of primary tumors with DC101
for 1 to 2 weeks did not affect neoplastic cell proliferation. Thus,
neoplastic cells in both tumor variants responded to therapy, but in
recurrent tumors they were more sensitive to the antiproliferative
stimuli triggered by the VEGFR2 blockade. In addition to changes in
the tumor vasculature and collagen content in recurrent tumors
(Table 1), radiation could induce in tumors some other thus far
unidentified alterations, which stimulated the antiproliferative
effects of DC101 therapy. These changes in tumor cell proliferation
may be mediated through specific paracrine interactions between
tumor and endothelial cells or other stromal cells in the irradiated
site. As shown in coculture, endothelial cells or sprouts can
stimulate tumor cell proliferation (33). Such paracrine interactions
are likely distinct in previously irradiated tumors but have not been
specifically studied yet. The mechanisms explaining why DC101
preferentially affected tumor cell proliferation in radiation recurrences need to be further explored.

Conclusion. We uncovered several characteristics of experimental recurrences following irradiation that distinguish them
from primary tumors of the same origin and size and affect their
growth and response to antiangiogenic therapy. Post-radiation
recurrences had fewer functional vessels and a lower vessel
coverage by perivascular cells. The vascular abnormalities, together
with the elevated collagen content, could inhibit the growth of
recurrent tumors. We also show that anti-VEGFR2 treatment has
greater inhibitory effects on tumor cell proliferation and growth in
previously irradiated than treatment-naive tumors.
