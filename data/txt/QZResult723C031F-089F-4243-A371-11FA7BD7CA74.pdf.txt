BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to test cladribine (2-CDA) alone
and in combination with rituximab in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
METHODS. Patients with MCL were treated on 2 sequential trials. In Trial 95-8053, patients received 2-CDA as initial therapy or at relapse. In Trial N0189,
patients received combination 2-CDA and rituximab as initial therapy. In both
trials, 2-CDA was administered at a dose of 5 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1
through 5 every 4 weeks for 2 to 6 cycles, depending on response. In Trial N0189,
rituximab 375 mg/m2 was administered on Day 1 of each cycle.

RESULTS. Results were reported for 80 patients. Twenty-six previously untreated
patients and 25 patients who had recurrent disease with a median age of 68 years
received single-agent 2-CDA. The overall response rate (ORR) was 81% with 42%

months (95% CI, 4.6-13.1 months), and 36% of patients remained alive at 2 years.
Twenty-nine eligible patients with a median age of 70 years received 2-CDA plus
rituximab. The ORR was 66% (19 of 29 patient), and the CR rate was 52% (15 of 29
patients). The median duration of response for patients who achieved a CR had
not been reached at the time of the current report, and only 3 of the patients who
achieved a CR developed recurrent disease at a median follow-up of 21.5 months.

2-CDA for Mantle Cell Lymphoma/Inwards et al.

M

antle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a poor-prognosis
lymphoma with a predilection for elderly men
that comprises 8% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
cases.1,2 The characteristic immunophenotype is
CD201, CD102, CD51, and CD232. A t(11;14)
(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation that juxtaposes
the cyclin D1 gene to the immunoglobulin heavychain (CCND1-IGH) enhancer region, resulting in
overexpression of cyclin D1, typically is present.3-5
There is no standard or curative therapy for
MCL. The regimens used vary by patient age and
eligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT). Hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone with rituximab (R–hyper-CVAD) or without rituximab (hyperCVAD) produces high response rates and has been
used alone or followed by ASCT but is not recommended for patients aged >65 years.6,7 Rituximab
combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) is a common regimen with a 34% to 48% complete response (CR) rate
and a median time to progression (TTP) of 16
months.8,9 It was reported that ASCT in first remission after CHOP induction yielded a 81% CR rate
with promising progression-free survival (PFS) in
patients who were in CR before ASCT.10
Many patients with MCL are not eligible for
ASCT or intensive regimens such as R–hyper-CVAD
because of advanced age or comorbidities. Other
patients are reluctant to be treated on aggressive
regimens. The purine nucleoside analogues typically
are tolerated well and are used extensively in indolent B-cell malignancies.11 The 2 studies described in
the current report were designed to determine the efficacy and toxicity of cladribine (2-CDA)-based therapy for MCL in patients who were not considered
eligible for dose-intense therapy or who preferred a
less aggressive approach.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years,
had measurable or evaluable MCL, had an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance score 3,
and had a life expectancy 12 weeks. Central pathology review confirmed the diagnosis of MCL before
study entry. The diagnostic criteria were the same for
both studies and required demonstration of either
cyclin D1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry
or molecular evidence of a CCND1-IGH translocation
in addition to characteristic immunophenotypic and
morphologic findings. Ki-67 staining was not done
routinely. Patients with central nervous system invol-

109

vement or with a life expectancy <12 weeks were
ineligible.
Trial 95-80-53 accepted patients who were previously treated or untreated; Trial N0189 enrolled
only untreated patients. Previously treated patients
could not have received a purine nucleoside analog.
The institutional review boards of all participating
institutions in the North Central Cancer Treatment
Group (NCCTG) approved these trials, and written
informed consent was obtained from each patient
before study entry.

Study Design
In Trial 95-80-53, patients received 2-CDA 5 mg/m2
intravenously over 2 hours on Days 1 through 5 every
28 days. Prophylactic filgrastim was not allowed.
Patients were to receive 2 cycles and would be
restaged. Patients in CR or who were stable after 2
cycles of treatment went to observation; those in PR
or who had a minor response (defined as a 25%-50%
reduction in the measurable lesions) received 2 additional cycles. After 4 cycles, patients who had
achieved a CR or those who had no further response
had treatment discontinued and were observed;
patients who had further improvement received
Cycles 5 and 6 and then went to observation. There
was no maintenance therapy. Patients who experienced episodes of Common Toxicity Criteria (version
2.0) grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (except fever,
hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal, or infection) went off
treatment. If the patient experienced grade 4 fever,
hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal, or infection at any
time, then treatment was discontinued. Dose adjustments and delays for neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia were specified.
Trial 95-80-53 was designed before the International Workshop guidelines of 1999 and originally
included a minor response category that was defined
as a reduction 25% but <50% in the sum of the
products of the greatest perpendicular dimensions of
the indicator lesion(s) documented for at least 4
weeks.12 Results of this trial will be reported according to the International Workshop guidelines to allow
for comparison with other trials.
In Trial N0189, patients received the same regimen of 2-CDA with the addition of rituximab 375
mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle and either pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneously on Day 6 or
subcutaneous filgrastim on Days 6 through 15. The
schema for treatment was similar to that for Trial 9580-53 with a few exceptions. Patients with a CR or an
unconfirmed CR after 2 cycles received 2 additional
cycles and then went to observation. Patients who
achieved a PR after 2 cycles received 2 additional

cycles and were restaged; if no further improvement
occurred, then they went to observation; those with
improvement or CR received 2 additional cycles for a
total of 6 cycles. Patients with stable disease after 2
cycles went to observation. There was no minor
response category; therefore, a patient with less than
a PR after 2 cycles was classified as having stable disease and went to observation. Patients remained on
observation until progression or the initiation of alternative therapy, which was treated as progression
for statistical purposes. The response criteria were
according to the International Workshop guidelines.

Statistical Methods
The trial of single-agent 2-CDA had a 2-stage design
for each patient population. The objective was to
achieve an ORR of 30% in the recurrent disease
group and 55% in the previously untreated group.
The trial of 2-CDA plus rituximab was designed as a
1-stage, Phase II trial, and the goal was to achieve a
CR rate of 65%. The accrual goal was 28 patients,

and 15 CRs were required to deem the regimen
worth pursuing in future studies. The study design
for each of the 3 cohorts was chosen to provide at
least 90% power for detecting the proposed true
response proportion at a significance level (P) .10.
All patients who met the eligibility criteria,
signed a consent form, and began treatment were
considered assessable for estimation of the response
rate, the distribution of PFS, and the distribution of
overall survival (OS). Confidence intervals (CIs) for
the true response rate were constructed using the
Duffy-Santner approach.13 The duration of treatment
response was defined as the time from the date of
the first observed CR until the date at which disease
progression was noted. PFS was defined as the time
from registration to disease progression. Patients
who died without documentation of progression
were considered to have had tumor progression on
the date of death unless documented evidence
clearly indicated that no progression occurred. Survival was defined as the time from registration to
death. The times to event distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.14

RESULTS
Eighty-one patients were accrued. One patient was
lost to follow-up after 1 cycle of therapy, and a second patient was deemed ineligible, leaving 79 eligible
patients with full follow-up (Table 1). Most patients
were men (81% overall), the median ages were 68
years and 70 years in the 2 studies, and most
patients had stage III or IV disease at study entry.
The majority of patients had an International Prognostic Index 2. The response rates determined for
all 3 groups are reported in Table 2.

Recurrent MCL
Expert pathology review prospectively identified 3
cases of mantle zone variant, 2 cases of blastoid variant, 1 case of nodular variant, and 18 cases of diffuse
variant MCL. Single-agent 2-CDA for recurrent MCL
demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 46%
(11 of 24 patients; 95% CI, 26%-66%) with a 25% PR
rate and a 21% CR rate. One patient was lost to follow-up after a single cycle of therapy and was not
evaluable for response. He was considered stable for
the purpose of this analysis. The median PFS was 5.4
months (Fig. 1). Patients were followed until death or
for a median of 6.3 years (range, 6.2-8.3 years). The
2-year survival rate was 36% (95% CI, 21%-61%), and
the median OS was 1.9 years (95% CI, 1.6-2.2 years).
At last follow-up, all but 2 patients had progressed,
and 3 remained alive. The median PFS was 5.4

months (95% CI, 4.6-13.1 months), and 25% of
patients (95% CI, 13%-50%) were progression free at
1 year.
Patients received a median of 2 cycles of 2-CDA
(range, 1-6 cycles). Seven patients had progressed by
restaging after Cycle 2.
Cladribine was well tolerated (Table 3). Doses
were delayed for 10 cycles in 6 patients and were
modified for 5 patients because of hematologic toxicity. The reasons for discontinuation of treatment
were completion according to the protocol (58%),
progression (33%), toxicity (4%), and patient refusal
(4%). The cause of death was disease related for 14
of the 21 patients (67%). The nondisease-related
causes of death were diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
from bone marrow transplantation, pulmonary embolism, Nocardia infection, and unknown (4
patients).

Initial Therapy With Single-agent 2-CDA
An expert pathology review prospectively identified 3
cases of mantle zone variant, 1 case of blastoid variant, 5 cases of nodular variant, and 17 cases of diffuse variant MCL. Single-agent 2-CDA produced an
ORR of 81% (21 of 26 patients; 95% CI, 61%-93%)
with a 39% PR rate and a 42% CR rate. Patients were

followed until death or for a median of 4.4 years
(range, 3.1-5.9 years). The median response duration
was 16.5 months. The median PFS was 13.6 months
(95% CI, 7.2-22.1 months), 50% of patients were progression free at 1 year (95% CI, 34%-73%), and 21%
of patients were progression free at 2 years. The 2-

year survival rate was 81% (95% CI, 67%-97%), and
the median OS was 4.7 years (95% CI, 2.8-5.2 years).
At last contact, 8 patients (31%) remained alive, and
3 patients (12%) remained progression free at 5
years.
The median number of cycles received was 4
(range, 1-6 cycles). Three patients had disease progression identified while on treatment. Doses were
delayed for 21 cycles in 14 patients and were modified for 6 patients because of hematologic toxicity
(Table 3). The reasons for discontinuation of treatment were completion according to the protocol
(69%), progression (19%), and toxicity (12%). The
cause of death was related to disease for 14 of 18
patient deaths (78%). The nondisease-related causes
of death were esophageal cancer, respiratory failure,
and unknown (2 patients).

Initial Therapy with 2-CDA/Rituximab
Between April 2003 and September 2005, 30 patients
were accrued to the trial of rituximab and 2-CDA.
One patient was deemed a major violation and was
excluded from all analyses, leaving 29 eligible
patients (Table 1). A preliminary pilot study to assess
toxicity of the regimen accrued 6 of the 29 patients.
Prophylactic pegfilgrastim or filgrastim support was
added because of 2 grade 4 neutropenia events that
occurred during the first cycle of treatment in the
pilot for the subsequent 23 patients.
An expert pathology review prospectively identified 2 cases of mantle zone variant, 2 cases of blastoid variant, and 25 cases of diffuse variant MCL.

The ORR for the combination was 66% (19 of 29).
The CR rate was 52% (15 of 29 patients). In addition,
4 of 29 patients (14%) achieved a PR, 7 of 29 patients
(24%) had stable disease according to the protocol
after 2 cycles and were taken off study, and 3
patients (10%) progressed on therapy. Of the 7
patients who had stable disease after 2 cycles, 3
patients would have been classified as having a
minor response under the design of the preceding
study and would have received 2 further cycles of
therapy before restaging. Of the 15 patients who
achieved a CR, only 3 patients had experienced a
relapse at the time of this report (368 days, 665 days,
and 1036 days after starting therapy) with a median
follow-up of 21.5 months in the CR patients. The median OS was not reached, and 43% of patients were
progression free at 2 years (Fig. 2).
Patients received a median of 4 cycles of therapy;
21 of 29 patients (72%) completed treatment according to the protocol design, 3 of 29 patients (10%)
progressed on therapy, 2 of 29 patients (7%) went off
study for an adverse event, 1 of 29 patients (3%)
went off study for alternative therapy for unclear reasons, 1 of 29 patients (3%) went off study because of
patient/physician choice, and 1 patient died on therapy from a cerebrovascular accident. Patients were
followed until death or for a median of 24.9 months
(range, 6.2-39.7 months) for patients who remained
alive. Disease progression was observed in 17 of 29
patients (52%). The PFS rate was 51% at 1 year (95%
CI, 36%-73%) and 43% at 2 years (95% CI, 28%-67%)
(Fig. 2). At last contact, 23 of 29 patients (79%)
remained alive. The 2-year OS rate was 78% (95% CI,
63%-95%).
Hematologic toxicities are listed in Table 3. Three
grade 4 nonhematologic adverse events were
reported. One patient experienced grade 3 pneumonia and sustained a subsequent cerebrovascular accident, resulting in death (grade 5). A second patient
had grade 4 hyperuricemia and grade 4 dyspnea that
were deemed unrelated to treatment at the point of
rapid disease progression.

DISCUSSION
The treatment of MCL remains challenging. Commonly used regimens include R-CHOP8,9,15 and R–
hyper-CVAD.6,7 Both produce high ORRs (>90%) but
do not appear to be curative. Early ASCT may
improve outcomes. Lenz et al8 randomized patients
with untreated MCL to CHOP versus R-CHOP and
reported median times to treatment failure of 14
months versus 21 months, respectively. Patients in
CR or PR aged <65 years were randomized to stem

cell transplantation versus interferon maintenance.
Only 14 patients who received R-CHOP underwent
ASCT. The authors reported that 4 of 14 patients
developed disease recurrence. It will require further
follow-up to determine whether this selected group
experiences long-term PFS.

113

For young, healthy patients, R–hyper-CVAD with
or without ASCT produces high response rates.6,7
Unfortunately, there appears to be a pattern of late
relapses with this approach. This regimen is not
recommended for patients aged >65 years because
of excessive toxicity.
Many patients with MCL are elderly or have
comorbidities that make intensive therapies such as
R-CHOP/ASCT or R–hyper-CVAD difficult. Some
patients who would be eligible prefer to take a less
aggressive approach. We have demonstrated in this
study that 2-CDA and 2-CDA plus rituximab are well
tolerated regimens that produce high response rates.
These results were obtained despite elderly study
populations (median ages, 68 years and 70 years; age
range, 39-86 years). The age distribution reflects
access to the trial for older patients in the community through the NCCTG as well as a bias toward
more aggressive therapy in younger patients. These
sequential trials do not allow any conclusions to be
drawn regarding the impact of the addition of rituximab to 2-CDA on response rates. A small change in
study design may have resulted in a lower ORR (66%
vs 81%) in the combination therapy study, because
patients were required to achieve at least a PR after 2
cycles of therapy to continue on study, whereas
patients who had evidence of a minor response after
2 cycles received 4 cycles before reassessment in the
previous study. The CR rate in the combined trial
(52%) did not reach the 65% target but was slightly
higher than the 42% CR rate in the single-agent trial.
The most striking difference between single-agent 2CDA and combined rituximab plus 2-CDA was the
apparent improved duration of response for patients
who received the combination, although a prospective randomized trial would be required to confirm
this finding. This is reflected in the superior 2-year
PFS rate at 43% versus 21% for 2-CDA alone as well
as in the durability of CRs, because only 3 of 15
patients had developed disease recurrence at a median follow-up of 21.5 months. Another possible contributor to greater response durability would be the
administration of more 2-CDA to patients in CR after
2 cycles of therapy in the second trial, because 4
patients who achieved a CR after only 2 cycles of
therapy received 2 additional cycles, whereas they
would have stopped therapy under the design of the
previous trial. The initial trial was written with conservative 2-CDA exposure because of concerns
regarding cytopenias as well as the hope that brief
duration therapy would be sufficient, which is the
case in hairy cell leukemia. The main toxicity of 2CDA is myelosuppression, specifically, neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia. Others have noted myelosup-

pression using 2-CDA in combination with alkylating
agents.16 Cladribine, either alone or in combination
with rituximab, was not associated with a significant
rate of opportunistic infections in these studies, in
which there was a single incidence of disseminated
Nocardia in a heavily pretreated patient. Antiviral
and antifungal prophylaxis was neither required nor
suggested.
These trials did not provide rituximab maintenance. A recent study of combined rituximab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone (RFCM)
induction followed by rituximab maintenance with 4
doses of rituximab at 3 months and 9 months postinduction demonstrated an improved TTP compared
with no maintenance, although there was no convincing plateau on the TTP curve.17 A recent trial of
modified R–hyper-CVAD (no methotrexate or cytosine arabinoside) in 22 patients was followed with 2
years of rituximab maintenance, and the median PFS
was 37 months.18
There have been other reports of 2-CDA activity
in MCL. Single-agent 2-CDA produced a 58% ORR in
12 patients with MCL.19 This was followed by a second trial that combined 2-CDA with mitoxantrone in
18 patients and demonstrated a 100% ORR with a
44% CR rate.20 Rituximab had a 33% ORR in patients
with recurrent MCL.21 The single-agent activity of
rituximab and 2-CDA led Robak et al22 to treat 9
patients with the combination of rituximab plus 2CDA, and 6 of those patients (66%) responded with 2
CRs (22%). A recent case of a CR in colonic MCL
obtained with combined rituximab plus 2-CDA was
reported.23
Fludarabine is another purine nucleoside analogue that has been tested in MCL, usually in combination with other agents.24 Single-agent fludarabine
yields a moderate ORR of 33% to 41%.25,26 Fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide resulted
in a 100% ORR with a 70% CR rate.27 The main toxicity of the regimen was myelosuppression and infection. In recurrent MCL, the addition of rituximab to
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone
(FCM) improved the ORR to 58% compared with
46% for FCM alone.28 Fludarabine has been used in
conditioning regimens for patients with MCL who
are undergoing reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation.29-31
One concern about using purine nucleoside analogs is potential difficulty in harvesting stem cells if a
subsequent transplantation is anticipated.32,33 Several
new agents have demonstrated activity in recurrent
MCL. The radioimmunotherapy agents tositumomab
(Bexxar) and ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) have
demonstrated single-agent activity that ranges from

30% to35%.34,35 Gopal et al36,37 have studied highdose tositumomab in the transplantation setting for
recurrent MCL. Temsirolimus is a mammalian target
of rapamycin inhibitor that produced a 38% ORR in
patients with relapsed MCL.38 It was reported
recently that bortezomib produced a 33% to 46%
response rate in recurrent MCL.39,40 The immunomodulatory agents thalidomide and lenalidomide also
are being tested in MCL.41-43
Rituximab plus 2-CDA should be included as a
standard induction regimen for older adults with
MCL. Further trials are indicated to determine
whether the results can be improved by the inclusion
of additional agents.
