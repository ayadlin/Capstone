ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide among women. Despite several therapeutic options, 15% of breast
cancer patients succumb to the disease owing to tumor relapse and acquired therapy
resistance. Particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), developing effective
treatments remains challenging owing to the lack of a common vulnerability that
can be exploited by targeted approaches. We have previously shown that tumor cells
have different requirements for growth in vivo than in vitro. Therefore, to discover
novel drug targets for TNBC, we performed parallel in vivo and in vitro genetic shRNA
dropout screens. We identified several potential drug targets that were required for
tumor growth in vivo to a greater extent than in vitro. By combining pharmacologic
inhibitors acting on a subset of these candidates, we identified a synergistic
interaction between EGFR and ROCK inhibitors. This combination effectively reduced
TNBC cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest. These results illustrate the power of in
vivo genetic screens and warrant further validation of EGFR and ROCK as combined
pharmacologic targets for breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

aberrations [2], only a fraction of these events contributes
to tumor formation and progression [3]. In the last decade,
there have been several sequencing efforts to unfold
the mutational landscape of tumors, to identify driver
mutations and develop targeted therapies [3-7]. In the
case of breast cancer, targeted endocrine therapies can
be used for ER+ and HER2+ tumors, but are ineffective
for the triple negative subtype due to the absence of
expression of hormone receptors. In fact, TNBC lacks
such oncogene signatures that would allow tumors to be
sub-grouped and specifically targeted. Aside from p53
mutations (80%), the most common genetic aberration in
TNBC is in PI3K, which occurs in 9% of the cases [6].
Additionally, a set of TNBC displays targetable BRCAlike clinical and pathological features, which render these
tumors sensitive to PARP inhibition [8]. More recently, a

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer and the second most common cause of cancerrelated deaths among women worldwide [1]. Although
several treatment options are available, 15% of breast
cancer patients succumb eventually, due to relapse and/
or distant metastases that are associated with acquired
resistance to current therapies. Especially triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC), which is named so due to the
absence of ER, PR and HER2 receptors and constitute 1520% of all breast cancers, has proven to be challenging
owing to the lack of a common vulnerability that can be
exploited by targeted approaches.
Although tumors generally have a high number
of mutations, genomic instability and chromosomal

detailed analysis of somatic alterations in breast cancer
samples revealed a number of mutations that are specific
to the basal-like breast cancer subtype [9]. However, a
significant proportion of patients are still dependent on
chemotherapeutic approaches.
Although the majority of TNBC tumors initially
respond to conventional chemotherapy, TNBC patients
still have a poor prognosis [10, 11]. Numerous clinical
studies have been conducted in recent years to assess the
effectiveness of targeted agents such as PARP, EGFR
and VEGF inhibitors in different settings. These efforts,
however, either failed to significantly improve patient
survival or were inconclusive [12, 13]. It therefore is
crucial and urgent to identify novel therapeutic targets to
treat TNBC.
At least as important as oncogene addiction is
the concept of non-oncogene addiction or essentiality,
reflecting that genetically unaltered and normally
functioning pathways (which would not be identified by
sequencing) can also be critical to a tumor’s maintenance
[14]. This phenomenon greatly expands the spectrum
of potential drug targets for cancer treatment. In line
with this, and because TNBC lacks genetically obvious
common vulnerabilities, we sought to identify novel drug
targets by performing unbiased genetic screening, which
is a powerful tool that has been widely employed in cancer
research to search for novel targets for therapy [15]. Since
in vitro screens typically fail to cover crucial components
that contribute to tumor progression such as stromal
interactions, immune system, and vascular structure, in
vivo screens have become a more favorable approach [16,
17]. We recently uncovered a synthetic lethal effect of
hypoxia and DNA damage response inhibition by a similar
approach [18], illustrating the power of performing such
screens in an in vivo setting. Therefore, we set out to carry
out parallel in vivo and in vitro loss-of-function shRNA
screens for the identification of novel targets for breast
cancer. Identified targets were subsequently interrogated
with pharmacological inhibitors using combination
screens to identify effective, synergistic combinations.

from the genome-wide TRC library [24] and composed
of ~3000 shRNAs targeting ~500 kinases [18, 25]. Two
TNBC cell lines, HCC1806 and MDA-MB-231, were
transduced with the kinome library in four pools (Figure
1A). After three days of antibiotic selection for successful
transduction and expansion, reference samples were
collected. The remaining cells were either injected into
the mammary fat pads of six NSG mice (in vivo screen)
or seeded in tissue culture dishes in six replicates (in vitro
screen). Tumors were harvested once they reached 50100mm3 and the cultured cells were harvested after two
expansions. The presence of each shRNA in reference, in
vitro and in vivo samples was quantified using genomic
DNA extraction followed by PCR amplification and deep
sequencing.
Before hit calling, we performed several quality
control analyses to confirm that the data generated from
the screens was sufficiently robust for negative selection
analyses. First, quantification of the shRNAs present in
tumors and in in vitro samples showed that the complexity
of the library was maintained throughout the experiment,
as we could detect approximately 3000 unique shRNAs
in the references, cultured cells and tumor samples.
Importantly, the majority of these shRNAs were shared
amongst all sample groups. Specifically, 85% were shared
between the cultured cells and tumors. These findings
indicate that the complexity of the library was well
maintained; this allowed the identification of shRNAs
that were lost due to functional selection of a specific
shRNA rather than random selection of shRNAs as a
result of sampling due to clonal expansion (Figure 1B,
Supplementary Figure 1A).
We observed a high correlation of shRNAs between
biological replicates (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure
1B). Unsupervised clustering analysis showed that, for
each experimental group, all biological replicates clustered
into one branch, suggesting that the abundance of shRNAs
present in these replicates is reproducible and supporting
the robustness of the system (Figure 1D, Supplementary
Figure 1C).

RESULTS

Identification of in vivo-specific targets
In vivo-specific hits were identified based on the
following criteria: 1) an shRNA should be significantly
depleted (p < 0.01) and have an effect size of at least
30% in tumors compared to in vitro samples; 2) a gene
should be represented with at least two shRNAs in the
screen; 3) an shRNA for a selected gene in (2) should not
be enriched more than 20% in in vitro samples compared
to the references; and 4) an shRNA for a selected gene
in (2) should not be enriched in tumor samples compared
to the references. For the genes targeted by shRNAs
fulfilling these criteria, we compared the hit lists from both
HCT1806 and MDA-MB-231 screens to finally generate
a list composed of genes identified in both screens,

Screening for kinases that are required for tumor
growth in vivo
In order to establish a physiologically relevant model
and identify more clinically realistic targets, we performed
an in vivo screen with a parallel in vitro counterpart. This
system allowed us to specifically uncover those genes that
are more critical for tumor survival in vivo compared to in
vitro [18]. Because tumors highly rely on kinase pathways
and new therapies targeting kinases are being widely
explored [23], we chose to use a kinome library derived

corresponding to the fifth selection criterion (Figure 2,
Table 1). The hit list comprised receptor tyrosine kinases
(EGFR, MERTK, IGF1R), intracellular signal transducers
(AKT1, MET, mTOR, RSK2), cytoskeletal regulators
(FAK, ROCK1), and some functionally under-investigated
genes (NEK5, SIK2).

Uncovering synergistic combinations
pharmacologically targeting hits

Establishing single-treatment dose response curves with
each matrix allowed us to compare combined treatments
with the expected additive effects of singe treatments
(Supplementary Figure 2). The results are presented as
synergy scores after calculating the differences between
the expected and the actual effects (Table 2a-2b). Scores
>1 are considered synergistic, provided that the self-self
combination of each drug has a lower score than the
combination score.
To rule out cell line-specific effects, we selected
combinations that showed synergistic effects in both
TNBC cell lines tested. One such combination, two mTOR
inhibitors (AZD8055 and Everolimus), was excluded from
the analysis because both target the same kinase. Within
the same pathway, we observed synergy when combining
AZD8055 or Everolimus with the AKT inhibitor MK2206.
This finding was reassuring, since synergistic effects of
AKT and mTOR inhibition have previously been reported
for other cancer types [27-30]. With this experimental
approach we observed a highly synergistic effect when
combining the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib (EGFRi) with the
ROCK inhibitor GSK269962A (ROCKi) (Supplementary
Figure 3). Based on these results, and on the results of
the shRNA screen on the same cell lines, we focused on
this combination for further investigation of potential
therapeutic applications in TNBC.

by

By using the kinome library for our screens, we
wished to take advantage of the fact that kinases are
relatively easy to target pharmacologically, allowing us
to translate our results to a pre-clinical setting. Notably,
previous experiences on targeted therapy approaches have
shown that most single-agent treatments fail to offer a
long-term solution as tumors commonly recur because of
drug resistance [26]. Moreover, an effective combination
of two or more targeted agents in TNBC is lacking. We
therefore sought to identify synergistic combinations
between our hits in both MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806
cells using an in vitro drug matrix setting. It is important to
point out here that the in vivo-in vitro differences observed
are not absolute but rather reflect sliding windows.
Therefore, certainly when combining the inhibition of
multiple targets, we expected to see significant effects in
in vitro assays also, aiming to find potential new treatment
regimens.
We selected the set of genes from our hit list against
which commercially inhibitors are available that are either
already FDA-approved or are being evaluated in clinical
trials for different types of cancer and other diseases. These
were combined with each other in 5x5 dose matrices.

screen. The identification of multiple unique shRNAs for
both EGFR and ROCK1 rules out a possible off-target
effect. To compare this validation with the screening
results, we studied in more detail the shRNA distribution
in each experimental group of the in vitro and in vivo
screens. As expected, we observed a more pronounced
loss of shRNAs targeting EGFR and ROCK1 in tumors as
compared to both the references and the in vitro cultured
cells (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 3A). We then
transduced TNBC cell lines with the individual shRNAs
against EGFR and ROCK1 and showed efficient silencing
of the target genes (Supplementary Figure 3B). Finally,
we evaluated the effect of EGFR and ROCK silencing on
tumor cell viability in vitro and growth in vivo. In vitro,
cell proliferation followed the same pattern predicted by
the screen results: knock down of either gene showed
little effect on the cell lines, with the exception of hairpin
#2 targeting ROCK1 in HCC1806 cells (Figure 3B,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Supplementary Figure 3C). As all hairpins for ROCK1
successfully depleted the protein, we could not determine
whether this reflected a difference in remaining ROCK1
levels (Supplementary Figure 3B). In vivo, on the contrary,
silencing of either ROCK1 or EGFR impaired growth of
HCC1806 xenografts (Figure 3C).

Combined EGFR and ROCK inhibition
effectively blocks proliferation of TNBC cells
Because the synergistic effect of EGFR and ROCK
inhibitor combination was identified in 72-hour doseresponse assays, we performed longer-term experiments
and confirmed that this combination has a major impact
on the expansion of both MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806
cells while single inhibitor treatment only mildly impairs
growth (Figure 4A). The effect of the inhibitors on EGFR
42862

and ROCK signaling was confirmed by analyzing EGFR,
AKT and MYPT phosphorylation status upon EGFR and
ROCK inhibitor treatments, respectively (Supplementary
Figure 4A). In addition, we found similar results with
other inhibitors of EGFR and ROCK, Afatinib and Fasudil,
respectively, suggesting that this is indeed a target-specific
and not a compound-specific effect (Supplementary Figure
4B). Moreover, double knockdown of EGFR and ROCK
impaired the growth of HCC1806 cells, further supporting
specificity of the effect of the inhibitors combination
(Supplementary Figure 4C).
The growth inhibition caused by EGFRi and
ROCKi combination was not limited to MDA-MB-231
and HCC1806 cells. We observed substantial growth
impairment in a panel of another six TNBC cell lines also

(Figure 4B). Furthermore, compared to each inhibitor
alone, the inhibitory growth effect of the combination
on orthotopic tumors formed by HCC1806 cells was
enhanced, however did not reach statistical significance
(Figure 4C). The combinatorial effect of EGFR and
ROCK inhibition was independent of the expression
levels of EGFR and ROCK proteins or of the phosphoEGFR or phospho-MYPT (downstream target of ROCK)
levels (Supplementary Figure 4D). This proof-of-concept
result warrants further validation and optimization of the
combined pharmacologic targeting of EGFR and ROCK
for TNBC.

Combined EGFR and ROCK inhibition causes
cell cycle arrest

However, we did not find any indication of apoptosis such
as floating cells, PARP or caspase 3 cleavage, or Annexin
V and PI positivity in HCC1806 or MDA-MB-231 cells
(data not shown). We therefore investigated whether either
of the inhibitor treatments or the combination would affect
how these tumor cells progress through the cell cycle.
DNA replication, as revealed by BrdU incorporation
during the S-phase, was only mildly decreased by the
single treatments, whereas the combination of EGFR
and ROCK inhibitors completely prevented MDAMB-231 cells from progressing through this cell cycle
phase (Figure 5A). Upon single treatment, we observed
a two-fold reduction in the number cells that incorporated
BrdU (corresponding to S-phase cells) while combination
treatment caused a four-fold reduction.

We next sought to identify the mechanism by which
combined inhibition of EGFR and ROCK impairs cell
growth. Consistent with the involvement of ROCK in the
regulation of cell shape and movement [31], we observed
major changes in cell morphology upon ROCK inhibitor
treatment (Supplementary Figure 5A). Cells became
flattened, larger and had several protrusions. When EGFR
and ROCK inhibitors were combined, the remaining cells
acquired neuron-like long extensions.
Since we found very few cells surviving the
combination treatment, we investigated whether coinhibition of EGFR and ROCK causes cell death.

into the 4th mammary fat pad of NSG mice. Starting from one day after inoculation, mice were orally treated six times a week with DMSOcontaining vehicle, 90mg/kg EGFRi, 10mg/kg ROCKi, or EGFRi+ROCKi. Tumors were measured twice weekly and the tumor volumes
were calculated by the formula a*b2/2.

We next analyzed the individual cell cycle phases
of single diploid cells. Consistent with the BrdU
incorporation results of the general population, we
observed a two-fold reduction in the number of cells that
went through the S-phase upon EGFR or ROCK inhibitor
treatment. Additionally, ROCK inhibitor alone and in
combination with EGRF inhibition caused a two-fold
increase in the number of cells in G2 phase as well as
an increase in the number of polyploid cells (Figure 5B).
Importantly, the number of diploid cells going through
S-phase upon combination treatment was almost six times
less than singe-drug-treated cells.
Consistently, phosphorylation of pRb, which is
essential for the cells to progress from G1 to S phase, was
not affected in cells treated with either inhibitor alone but
was almost abolished upon combination treatment. The
reduction in pRb phosphorylation was accompanied by
loss of Cyclin A and Cdk2, as well as p27Kip1, which has
an essential role in assembling Cyclin-Cdk complexes [58]

(Figure 5C). These data suggest that combined inhibition
of EGFR and ROCK impedes cells from progressing
through the cell cycle, arresting cells in both G1 and G2
phases of the cell cycle and consequently restricting the
proliferative capacity of TNBC cells.

DISCUSSION
Targeted therapy has arisen as an alternative to
cytotoxic drugs in cancer therapy, in some cases increasing
the response rate of patients as well as overall survival
and progression-free survival [32]. The major challenge
of targeted therapy is the issue of drug resistance, which
eventually develops. More durable clinical responses
are seen when targeted therapies were combined with
radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other targeted compounds
[33, 34]. Here, we report combined EGFR-ROCK
inhibition as a potential combination treatment for triplenegative breast cancer.

We performed two loss-of-function screens in vivo
and in vitro using two distinct TNBC cell lines in order to
uncover common potential targets in TNBC. We ensured
focusing on more clinically relevant targets by 1) using a
library comprising shRNAs targeting kinases which are
generally targetable by drugs; and 2) comparing shRNA
loss in tumors relative to cultured cells, corresponding
to the two arms in the screen. Our hit list contains genes
coding kinases with established oncogenic functions such
as MET [35], EGFR [36, 37], AKT, mTOR [38-40], RSK2
[41] as well as genes that do not (yet) have an established
role in cancer progression (NEK5, SIK2). Our hit list also
comprised genes like ROCK1 and FAK that are known
to play a role in migration, invasion and metastasis but
have only recently been implicated in tumor progression
[42-45].
It is increasingly clear that for durable clinical
responses to occur one needs to develop effective
combinatorial strategies [22, 46]. Moreover, unlike
genetic manipulation by shRNAs, pharmacologic
inhibition of targets allows flexibility in timing, dosing
and order of treatment. For these reasons, we combined
our in vivo screening with an in vitro pharmacologic
approach in order to find more effective, combined
treatment options. We combined eight compounds with
each other in a matrix setting in which five doses of one
drug were combined with five doses of a second drug. We
used this experimental system to assess the effect on the
proliferation of HCC1806 and MDA-MB-231 cells. This
resulted in the identification of two pairs of inhibitors that
showed synergistic effects: EGFR + ROCK, and AKT +
mTOR inhibitors. Since mTOR inhibition increases AKT
activity by disrupting feedback inhibition [47, 48], vertical
targeting of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway has proven to
be a promising approach in several cancer types [27-29],
with clinical trials ongoing [30]. We find this combination
with two different inhibitors targeting mTOR (Everolimus
and AZD8055), validating the accuracy of our system.
The anti-proliferative effect of the combination
of a ROCK and EGFR inhibitor on the other hand, has
not been described before. ROCK, an effector of the
small GTPase Rho, is widely studied in the context
of cell shape and movement. It is known to be a major
regulator of migration, influencing cellular characteristics
such as contraction, actin organization and polarity [49].
Consistent with this, we observed major morphological
changes upon ROCK inhibition in all cell lines we
analyzed. Aside from its critical role in migration, ROCK
inhibition has been shown to cause defects in cytokinesis
[50]. In line with this, we observed an increased number of
G2 and polyploid cells upon treating with ROCK inhibitor.
However, although this slowed down the proliferation rate,
it did not severely impair cell growth in the long run. Also
in vivo, ROCK inhibitor had no impact on tumor growth.
ROCK inhibition as an anti-tumor treatment is not

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

widely investigated but its potential use in combination
with chemotherapy or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors is
increasingly recognized [51]. For instance, ROCK and
Brc-Abl co-inhibition leads to apoptosis and cell cycle
defects in chronic myeloid leukemia cells [52]. We also
recently showed that in combination with either BRAF,
ERK or MEK inhibition, ROCK inhibition delays
melanoma growth [25, 53]. In several TNBC cell lines,
we observed substantial growth impairment in vitro
upon treatment with both EGFR and ROCK inhibitors
compared with single-agent treatment. A similar pattern
was seen for in vivo growth of HCC1806 cells. However,
unlike the recent findings for lung cancer [54], we did not
find a correlation between the response of TNBC cells
to combination treatment and EGFR mutation status,
phospho-EGFR, phospho-MYPT or ROCK protein levels,
suggesting a cell type-specific component.
To begin to explore the mechanistic basis for our
observations, we found that co-inhibition of EGFR and
ROCK induces cell cycle arrest in HCC1806 and MDAMB-231 cells. This was accompanied by a decrease in the
protein levels of cyclin A, Cdk2, p27 and phosphorylated
pRB. Cyclin A - Cdk2 complex is active at two points in
the cell cycle: during onset of S phase and in early G2
phase. The function of Cyclin A - Cdk2 in G2 is thought
to be the regulation of Cyclin B - Cdk1 levels to enter
mitosis [55-57]. Therefore, absence of an active Cyclin A Cdk2 complex would cause insufficient levels of Cyclin B
- Cdk1 complex formation, leading to a failure in mitosis
entry and causing the cells to accumulate at G2 phase.
Although p27 is known to act as a cell cycle inhibitor
by blocking the activity of Cyclin E - Cdk2 complex, it
also aids in the assembly of Cyclin D - Cdk4 complexes
[58, 59], allowing cells to progress through the G1 phase.
Another major inhibitor of the cell cycle is pRB. In its
unphosphorylated form, pRB binds to E2F and inhibits
its transcriptional activity whereas phosphorylated pRB
dissociates from E2F, allowing cell cycle gene expression
and entry into the S phase [60]. Co-inhibition of EGFR
and ROCK in triple-negative breast cancer cells caused
decrease in phosphorylated pRB, p27, Cyclin A and Cdk2
protein levels, correlating with an almost complete loss
of the ability of the cells to replicate and consequently,
proliferate.
In conclusion, we demonstrate here that EGFR and
ROCK are potential in vivo targets for triple-negative
breast cancer in a combination setting: co-inhibition of
EGFR and ROCK has a profound inhibitory impact on
cell proliferation in a panel of TNBC cell lines, in vitro
as well as in mice, which was at least partially explained
by the induction of cell cycle arrest. This proof of concept
warrants further validation and optimization to determine
whether this ought to be studied in the clinic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

shRNAs were quantified after PCR amplification and deep
sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2000). Results were analyzed
with the DESeq package of R/Bioconductor [20,21].
shRNAs that are detected with less than 200 reads on
average in the references and in in vitro samples were
excluded from the analysis. Normalized read numbers
were compared between tumors and cultured cells in order
to determine the shRNAs that were lost 30% more in vivo
than in vitro. Genes targeted with at least two shRNAs
with a false discovery rate < 0.1 were considered hits,
provided that they were not enhanced more than 20% in
in vitro samples compared with the reference samples.

For long-term cell growth assays, cells were seeded
on 6-well or 12-well plates (Corning). Drugs were added
on the following day and media was refreshed every third
day with new compound dilutions. At the end time point,
the cells were stained with crystal violet. ROCK inhibitors
used were GSK269962A (Axon) and Fasudil (Selleck).
EGFR inhibitors used were Gefitinib (MedChem) and
Afatinib (Selleck).
For DNA content and cell cycle analysis,
sub-confluent cells were incubated with 10uM
Bromdeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 1.5 hours, trypsinized, fixed
in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and stained with anti-BrdU and
Propidium Iodide (PI).

Synergy matrix
HCC1806 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded
onto 384-well plates at 103 and 2.5*103 cells/well,
respectively, and treated with 5 serial dilutions of one
drug combined with 5 serial dilutions of a second drug in
a matrix format. The maximum dose used per drug did not
exceed its IC50. In order to obtain a dose-response curve
from the drugs in the matrices, cells were treated with six
more serial dilutions of higher doses of each drug outside
of the matrix. After 72 hours, cells were incubated for two
hours in CellTiter Blue at 1:20 dilution and the absorbance
was measured at TECAN. Synergy matrix calculations
were done as described before [22].

Immunoblot analysis and antibodies
Cells were harvested in ice by scraping in ice
cold 1X PBS and the pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer
(50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, complete protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and phosphatase inhibitors 10
mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
10 mM beta-glycerophosphate). After sonication and
centrifugation the protein concentrations were determined
using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Samples
were loaded on 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide-SDS gels
(NuPAGE) and transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes
(Amersham). Membranes were blocked in 4% skimmed
milk powder dissolved in 0,2% Tween-containing 1X
PBS and incubated with primary antibodies followed by
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies
used were EGFR (sc-03, Santa Cruz), EGFRY2068 (ab5644,
Abcam), ROCK1 (611137, BD), MYPTThr696 (ABS45,
Millipore), ERKThr202/Tyr204 (4370S, Cell Signaling), ERK
(9102, Cell Signaling), Hsp90 (sc-7947, Santa Cruz), p27
(610241, BD), pRBSer807/811 (9308S, Cell Signaling), CDK2
(sc-163, Santa Cruz), Cyclin A (sc-596, Santa Cruz).

In vivo and in vitro screens
A lentivirus-based Kinome shRNA library targeting
~500 kinases and kinase-related genes with ~3000
shRNAs was assembled from the human genome-wide
shRNA collection (TRCHs1.0). The screens were set up
and performed as described before [18]. Briefly, 1.5x106
cells were seeded in 10cm culture dishes and infected for
6 hours (MOI<0.2) with lentivirus-containing supernatant.
After 3 days of puromycin selection (1 mg/ml), the
reference samples were collected. The remaining cells
were either mixed with 1:1 matrigel and injected into
the 4th mammary fat pad of 6 female NOD/SCID IL2γnull
(NSG) mice (0.5x106 cells/mouse), or seeded on 6x10cm
dishes and maintained in culture in parallel (0.5x106
cells/dish). The cells and the tumors were harvested
after two and three weeks, respectively. This procedure
was repeated for each of the 4 Kinome library pools.
For the quantification of shRNAs in all samples, gDNA
was isolated (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, Qiagen) and

somatic mutation patterns and pathway alterations in
human cancers. Nature. 2010; 466:869-73. doi: 10.1038/
nature09208.

All animal work was done in accordance with a
protocol approved by the Netherlands Cancer Institute
Animal Experiment Ethics Committee. Female NSG mice
aged 5-8 weeks were used for all in vivo experiments.
Human breast cancer cells were prepared as 107 cells/
ml suspension in medium, mixed 1:1 with growth factor
reduced matrigel and 100ul of the mixture was injected
into the 4th mammary fat pad of the mice on both sides
(0.5*106 cells/injection). Mice were orally treated
with drugs 6 days/week, starting one day after tumor
inoculation. GSK269962 was dissolved in DMSO at
100mM and diluted in 10% Tween80 and 6.5% ethanol
mix to 10mg/kg. Gefitinib was dissolved in DMSO at
200mM and diluted in 2% Tween80 to 90mg/kg. Tumors
were manually measured twice a week with a caliper and
tumor volume was calculated by the formula a*b2/2 where
‘a’ is the longest diameter and ‘b’ is the perpendicular
diameter to ‘a’. One-Way ANOVA corrected for multiple
comparisons (Holm-Sidak) was used to compare
more than two experimental groups (Prism; GraphPad
Software). Error bars represent standard error of the mean
(SEM).
