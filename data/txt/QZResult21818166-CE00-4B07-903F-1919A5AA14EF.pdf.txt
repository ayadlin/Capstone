Abstract
A number of cancers predominantly metastasize to bone, due to its complex microenvironment and multiple
types of constitutive cells. Prostate cancer especially has been shown to localize preferentially to bones with
higher marrow cellularity. Using an experimental prostate cancer metastasis model, we investigated the effects of
cyclophosphamide, a bone marrow–suppressive chemotherapeutic drug, on the development and growth of
metastatic tumors in bone. Priming the murine host with cyclophosphamide before intracardiac tumor cell
inoculation was found to signiﬁcantly promote tumor localization and subsequent growth in bone. Shortly after
cyclophosphamide treatment, there was an abrupt expansion of myeloid lineage cells in the bone marrow and the
peripheral blood, associated with increases in cytokines with myelogenic potential such as C-C chemokine ligand
(CCL)2, interleukin (IL)-6, and VEGF-A. More importantly, neutralizing host-derived murine CCL2, but not IL-6, in
the premetastatic murine host signiﬁcantly reduced the prometastatic effects of cyclophosphamide. Together,
our ﬁndings suggest that bone marrow perturbation by cytotoxic chemotherapy can contribute to bone
metastasis via a transient increase in bone marrow myeloid cells and myelogenic cytokines. These changes
can be reversed by inhibition of CCL2. Cancer Res; 72(10); 2522–32. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Bone is the predominant site of prostate cancer metastasis,
and patients with advanced-stage prostate cancer commonly
develop metastatic bone lesions (1). Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of skeletal metastasis is not yet completely understood (2). One major obstacle to better understanding skeletal
metastasis is the unusual complexity of the tumor microenvironment in bone (3), due to multiple constituent cell types.
Emerging evidence supports that cells in the bone marrow
microenvironment are actively involved in prostate cancer
metastasis (4).
Bone marrow–derived myeloid lineage cells are critical
regulators of tumor progression and metastasis (5–10). Yang
and colleagues showed that expansion of Gr-1þCD11bþ myeloid cells directly promotes tumor angiogenesis (6) via
increased production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9

(7). Myeloid cells (expressing surface markers CD11b and/or
Gr-1) are a major component of undifferentiated bone marrow
cells, and ultimately differentiate into monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes (10). Parallel to the tumorigenic roles
of myeloid cells, monocyte macrophages also have been shown
to participate in tumor metastasis (11–13). All of these data
collectively support the critical roles of myeloid lineage cells in
prostate cancer progression and bone metastasis. However, it
is not clearly understood how the alterations in the bone
marrow occur, which could provide clues for therapeutic
approaches.
In clinical settings, chemotherapeutic drugs and/or irradiation perturb the bone marrow microenvironment, leading to
alterations in marrow cellular composition. Although chemotherapy and irradiation are both bone marrow suppressive, the
subsequent recovery process may lead to temporary spikes of
certain cell types, including monocytes and neutrophils (14,
15). Therefore, net effects of bone marrow–suppressive agents
could have pro- or antitumorigenic effects. Interestingly, priming the murine host with cyclophosphamide, a bone marrow–
suppressive chemotherapeutic drug, promoted subcutaneous
tumor growth and metastasis in several mouse models (16–19).
Cyclophosphamide is a DNA-alkylating drug commonly
included in chemotherapeutic regimens against breast and
lung cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In addition,
cyclophosphamide is used in the conditioning regimen for
recipients of myeloablative bone marrow transplantation, to
enhance engraftment and suppress the host immune reaction. Intriguing data showing opposite prometastatic effects
of chemotherapeutic drugs remain poorly investigated.

Cyclophosphamide Supports Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis

To our best knowledge, the effects of cyclophosphamide on
skeletal metastasis have never been reported. Given that
prostate cancer has been shown to use similar strategies as
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell homing and that prostate cancer has long been known to home typically to bones
enriched with red marrow (20), we hypothesized that alterations induced by cyclophosphamide in the bone marrow
microenvironment would contribute to prostate cancer
colonization in the bone and/or subsequent tumor growth.
In the current study, we investigated prometastatic effects of
bone marrow suppression in a prostate cancer skeletal
metastasis model and explored the underlying mechanisms
that could be used to design methods of therapeutic
intervention.

Materials and Methods
Cells
Luciferase-labeled PC-3 cells (PC-3Luc) were established
from the PC-3 cell line (American Type Culture Collection;
ATCC), as previously described (20). PC-3Luc cells were regularly authenticated and matched short tandem repeat DNA
proﬁles of the original PC-3 cell line (last tested on May 9, 2009).
Mouse models of prostate cancer
All experimental protocols were approved by the University
of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For
a skeletal metastasis model, the procedure described by Park
and colleagues was followed (21). Brieﬂy, 2  105 PC-3Luc cells
were injected into the left heart ventricle of male athymic mice
(Harlan Laboratories). For an orthotopic bone tumor model,
1  103 PC-3Luc cells were injected in the proximal tibiae as
described (21).
Ex vivo murine bone marrow microvascular angiography
Murine bone marrow vasculature was visualized by a modiﬁed method of Guldberg and colleagues (22) Mice were
anesthetized and perfused sequentially with heparin-supplemented Ringer's lactate (9 minutes), formalin (9 minutes), and
MICROFIL (Flow Tech, 7 minutes) via the intracardiac route.
Following polymerization, femurs were dissected, decalciﬁed,
and scanned by microcomputed tomography (mCT).
Neutralizing antibodies
Anti-mouse CCL2 antibody (C1142, Janssen) and anti-mouse
interleukin (IL)-6 antibody (R&D Systems) were provided by
Janssen, LLC. C1142 is a rat/mouse chimeric antibody speciﬁc
for mouse C-C chemokine ligand (CCL)2/MCP-1 and does not
cross-react with human CCL2 or mouse MCP-5 (23–25). Nonspeciﬁc IgG from mouse serum (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a
control antibody.
Flow cytometry
Bone marrow cells were collected by ﬂushing femurs and
tibiae. Lungs, liver, and kidney were digested in complete
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented with 0.5
mg/mL collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich). One million cells were
used for ﬂow cytometry (BD Bioscience).

www.aacrjournals.org

Complete blood counting with white blood cell
differentials
Blood cell counting was carried out in the University of
Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, using a Forcyte automatic hematology analyzer (Oxford Science).
Quantitative PCR
The mRNA samples were prepared from the ﬂushed bone
marrow cells, followed by real time-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) for CD31 and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Applied Biosystems).
Statistical analyses
Experimental skeletal metastasis experiments were analyzed using linear mixed models. The primary outcome was
the natural log transformed bioluminescence measurement.
Fixed covariates in the model included the groups in the
experiment and time (weeks) and the interaction between
group and time. The repeated measures aspect of the model,
due to multiple measurements over time within each mouse,
was adjusted for using a single order autoregressive correlation
structure. Contrasts were used to test the pairwise comparisons of interest. Analyses were completed using SAS (SAS
Institute) with a type I error of 5%.
All other statistical analyses, including Kaplan–Meier analyses of metastasis-free mice, Student t tests comparing 2
groups, and Mann–Whitney U tests of samples failing to
distribute normally, were conducted with GraphPad Prism.

Results
Cyclophosphamide enhanced experimental prostate
cancer skeletal metastasis in vivo
Cyclophosphamide has been shown to promote subcutaneous tumor growth and experimental metastasis in various
animal models (16–19). Initially, the effects of cyclophosphamide on prostate cancer skeletal metastasis were investigated.
The experimental design is schematically shown in Fig. 1A. The
serum half-life of cyclophosphamide is less than 17 minutes (in
mice) and 6.5 hours (in human), and mice were allowed 7 days
of recovery to insure that the drug was completely cleared, to
avoid any direct antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide (26,
27). Interestingly, mice primed with cyclophosphamide developed signiﬁcantly larger tumors in the hind limb bones after 7
days (Fig. 1B). Cyclophosphamide-treated mice exhibited
increased tumor bioluminescence in the mandible also, but
the effects were variable and not statistically signiﬁcant until
day 35 (Fig. 1C). Because hind limb skeletal metastases are
more clinically relevant, and also murine mandibles are signiﬁcantly different from human (e.g., continuous eruption of
incisors), the hind limb skeletal metastases were the focus of
subsequent investigation. Cyclophosphamide-primed mice
developed hind limb metastases at an earlier time point
(i.e., increased incidence of metastases on day 7, 14, and 21; Fig.
1D), compared with the saline-treated group that developed
detectable hind limb metastatic lesions only after 14 days.
These data suggest that the larger tumor size on day 42 in the
hind limbs of cyclophosphamide-treated mice (Fig. 1E) is

A single dose of cyclophosphamide signiﬁcantly
disrupted bone marrow vascular integrity
Cyclophosphamide has been found to cause damage to
endothelial cells, potentially promoting tumor cell seeding in
the metastatic target organs (28). These data are consistent
with the observation in Fig. 1 showing outgrowth of metastatic
tumors at earlier time points in the cyclophosphamide-treated
hosts. Consequently, an experiment was designed to test
whether a single dose of cyclophosphamide could perturb

endothelial integrity in the bone marrow, which might in turn
lead to increased extravasation of tumor cells immediately
after inoculation. Because immunohistochemistry can only
provide 2-dimensional images of selected cross-sections, a
technique to reconstruct 3-dimensional vascular structures
enclosed in calciﬁed tissues was used (ref. 22; Fig. 2A). In Fig.
2B, this technique clearly showed 3-dimensional structures of
microvessels in the epiphyses and the central sinusoidal vessels
in the diaphyses of saline controls. In sharp contrast, a single
dose of cyclophosphamide very obviously disrupted vascular
integrity and continuity (Fig. 2C). Quantiﬁcation of the images
in Fig. 2B and C showed that bone marrow vascular volume was

signiﬁcantly reduced by cyclophosphamide (Fig. 2D). CD31 (an
endothelial-speciﬁc marker) gene expression in bone was
signiﬁcantly suppressed with cyclophosphamide administration (Fig. 2E), but not in lungs, liver, and kidney (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, bone marrow endothelial cells treated
with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC, a metabolite of
cyclophosphamide with in vitro biologic activity) had signiﬁcantly increased apoptosis (Fig. 2F). Taken together, cyclophosphamide-induced vascular disruption led to altered endothelial cells in the bone marrow.
Cyclophosphamide treatment did not cause systemic
inﬂammation
We next ruled out the possibility that cyclophosphamide
promoted metastasis by systemic inﬂammation secondary to
the bone marrow suppression. Cyclophosphamide-treated
mice had signiﬁcantly reduced body weight, compared with
the saline control groups, and the effects lasted more than 2
weeks (Supplementary Fig. S2A). However, cyclophosphamidetreated mice regained body weight with a similar trend to the
saline-treated controls. In addition, cyclophosphamide-treated mice did not show any signiﬁcant lethargy or signs of
systemic inﬂammation, the latter often signaled by increased
circulating levels of C-reactive protein (Supplementary Fig.
S2B).
Cyclophosphamide pretreatment promoted orthotopic
prostate tumor growth in bone
The potential role of disrupted bone marrow vascular
integrity secondary to cyclophosphamide treatment in the
increased metastatic tumor growth in the bone was further
tested using an orthotopic approach (Fig. 3A). This approach
was designed to circumvent the effects of vascular disruption

2526

that could contribute to initial tumor cell seeding. PC-3 tumors
grew larger after 6 weeks in the cyclophosphamide-treated
bone marrow, than in control (Fig. 3B and C), suggesting that
alterations in the cyclophosphamide-treated murine bone
marrow, not a speciﬁc compromise of vascular integrity, were
responsible for promoting tumor growth and/or metastasis.
Cyclophosphamide transiently expanded myeloid
lineage cells
On the basis of the observation in Figs. 2 and 3, alterations
induced by cyclophosphamide potentially contributing to
tumor growth and/or metastasis were investigated. The
changes of white blood cell (WBC) differential counts were
further investigated serially after cyclophosphamide administration. Total WBC counts were signiﬁcantly reduced 3 to 15
days after cyclophosphamide, indicating that cyclophosphamide suppressed bone marrow, and that the effects lasted
more than 2 weeks (Fig. 4A). However, the WBC count was
increased on day 7 compared with the day 3 cyclophosphamide
group (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, neutrophil number was below
detection on day 3 but signiﬁcantly spiked on day 7, immediately followed by suppression (Fig. 4B). In addition, monocyte
counts showed a similar pattern to neutrophils (Fig. 4C).
Collectively, these data revealed that differentiated myeloid
cells in the peripheral blood (i.e., monocytes and neutrophils)
transiently increased during recovery from cyclophosphamide.
Because both monocytes and neutrophils are differentiated
from myeloid lineage cells in the bone marrow, the nature of
the changes of myeloid lineage cells in the bone marrow
was determined. Flow cytometric analyses of bone marrow
cells from mice treated with cyclophosphamide after 3, 7, 10,
and 15 days revealed that myeloid lineage cells (expressing
CD11b) were signiﬁcantly expanded 7 and 10 days after

increased photon emission from the hind limbs compared with the saline-treated mice (pairwise linear contrasts P < 0.01 at all time points). The 3-day group had
signiﬁcantly increased tumor burden compared with the 7-day group on week 5 imaging (pairwise linear contrasts P < 0.01), whereas the 15-day group had
signiﬁcantly reduced tumor burden compared with the 7-day group (pairwise linear contrasts P < 0.01). Data are median  interquartile range.

than the saline-treated control group, as observed previously.
When tumor cells were injected at a later time point (i.e., 15
days after cyclophosphamide treatment), signiﬁcantly fewer
mice developed hind limb metastatic lesions, suggesting that
levels of bone marrow myeloid cell populations correlate with
hind limb metastases (Fig. 5B and C). The 3-day group had a
similar metastatic pattern as the 7-day group (Fig. 5B) and
increased tumor size compared with the 7-day group (Fig. 5C),
potentially because of prolonged survival of tumor cells in the
systemic circulation overriding the expansion of bone marrow
myeloid cells.
Neutralizing host-derived murine CCL2, but not IL-6,
inhibited cyclophosphamide-induced prostate cancer
bone metastasis
These data described earlier collectively showed that cyclophosphamide provided an environment conducive to experimental prostate cancer skeletal metastasis, potentially mediated by increase of serum cytokines and/or expansion of
myeloid cells. The causal relationship of alterations induced
by cyclophosphamide and tumor metastasis was determined
using the intracardiac metastasis model in combination with

neutralizing antibodies. Mice were treated with neutralizing
antibodies targeting mouse IL-6 or mouse CCL2 during the 7
day recovery phase after cyclophosphamide treatment (Fig.
6A). Consistent with the observation in Fig. 1B, cyclophosphamide treatment signiﬁcantly enhanced the development and
subsequent growth of experimental bone metastasis (Fig. 6B;).
Neutralizing IL-6 did not prevent development of metastases
in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. However, neutralizing
CCL2 signiﬁcantly inhibited cyclophosphamide-induced prostate cancer metastasis in vivo (statistical comparison shown
in Fig. 6C and D), indicating that the upregulation of CCL2 in
response to cyclophosphamide contributed to the development and progression of metastasis. Moreover, administration
of both antibodies against IL-6 and CCL2 had similar effects to
the anti-CCL2 antibody alone group (Fig. 6B–D). Importantly,
neutralizing antibodies were administered before the tumor
cell inoculation, to exclude the possibility of direct effects of the
drug on the tumor cells. Therefore, the effects of neutralizing
antibody were mainly due to the changes exerted on the host
microenvironment. However, preclinical pharmacokinetic
studies showed that anti-CCL2 antibody can remain detectable
in serum up to 10 days after administration, thus the possibility

of direct effects may not be completely excluded (personal
communication).
An alternative chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel, did
not promote skeletal metastases
To further determine the causal role of cyclophosphamideinduced myeloid cell expansion to the development of skeletal
metastasis, the effects of docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent
commonly included in prostate cancer treatment regimens,
were tested. In contrast to cyclophosphamide-mediated prometastatic effects, pretreatment of mice with docetaxel
decreased hind limb skeletal metastasis (Fig. 7B). In addition,
CD11bþ cell enumeration in the docetaxel-treated bone marrow revealed similar but signiﬁcantly blunted alterations in
CD11bþ cells in comparison with the effects of cyclophosphamide (Fig. 7C). Docetaxel-induced myeloid cell expansion
(59.1%  12.1%) at day 7 was not sufﬁcient enough to increase
myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes) in the peripheral
blood (Fig. 7D–F).

Discussion
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain why
bone provides a congenial metastatic microenvironment. For
example, bone is enriched with cytokines and growth factors
that promote tumor cell proliferation, migration, and survival
(32). In addition, bone houses the primary hematopoietic organ
(i.e., bone marrow), containing multiple types of progenitor
cells and hematopoietic cells of various tumorigenic potential.
Previously, Schneider and colleagues showed that expansion of
bone marrow cellularity before inoculation of prostate tumor
cells signiﬁcantly promoted skeletal metastasis (20), suggesting bones with increased cellularity constitute a more congenial microenvironment for metastasis. In this context, it is
reasonable to expect that cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or
irradiation may impact skeletal metastasis.
This study showed for the ﬁrst time that alterations induced
by cyclophosphamide, a common chemotherapeutic drug,
enhanced prostate cancer skeletal metastasis. Furthermore,
we showed that the prometastatic effects of cyclophosphamide

Cyclophosphamide Supports Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis

were signiﬁcantly reversed by suppression of CCL2, which
suggests the causal role of bone marrow myeloid lineage cell
expansion. We showed that a single dose of cyclophosphamide
administration increased myelogenic cytokines, and correspondingly expanded the myeloid cell population in the bone
marrow, as well as the numbers of monocytes and neutrophils
transiently in the peripheral blood.
The unexpected "opposite" protumorigenic effect of such a
chemotherapeutic drug is not a novel observation in other
nonskeletal sites. There have been several reports of chemotherapy-induced metastasis and/or tumor growth (18, 19, 33,
34). Most notably, Carmel and Brown showed that pretreatment of the host with cyclophosphamide, among many other
chemotherapeutic drugs including actinomycin D, vinblastine,
bleomycin, methotrexate, and 5-ﬂuorouracil, resulted in the
most prominent prometastatic effects in a syngeneic sarcoma
lung metastasis model (17). While most of the previous studies
focused on an experimental pulmonary metastasis model, our
data expanded the earlier observations by showing the prometastatic effects of chemotherapy in a skeletal metastasis
model (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Data in the present
study suggest that chemotherapeutic drugs with strong bone
marrow suppression may have the adverse effect of promoting bone metastasis, a ﬁnding that has not been extensively
investigated. Cyclophosphamide is not a standard chemotherapeutic drug for patients with prostate cancer, but recently low-dose metronomic administration of cyclophosphamide
is in clinical trials as an antiangiogenic therapy in prostate
cancer (35, 36). In addition, cyclophosphamide is widely used
for treatment of breast cancer, which also has a strong
propensity for skeletal metastasis. Consequently, the effects
of varying dosages and administration scheduling of cyclophosphamide on bone metastasis warrant extensive further
studies.
The ﬁndings concerning the mechanisms involved in chemotherapy-enhanced metastasis have clinically therapeutic
implications. We showed that the numbers of bone marrow
myeloid cells and myelomonocytic cells in the peripheral blood
are signiﬁcantly increased after cyclophosphamide administration, but not after docetaxel administration, potentially
mediated by the increase of myelogenic cytokines. During the
recovery phase after bone marrow suppression, spikes of
monocytes and neutrophils are frequently observed in
patients, and clinically considered a favorable prognostic sign
(37). Data in the present study conﬁrmed an abrupt increase of
neutrophils and monocytes shortly after cyclophosphamide
administration. Moreover, signiﬁcant increases in CCL2, IL-6,
and VEGF-A, all of which are potent myelogenic factors, were
observed simultaneously or before the expansion of myelomonocytic cells, supporting the roles of these factors in the
expansion of CD11bþ myeloid cells in the bone marrow.
Results of this work conﬁrmed that neutralizing CCL2, but
not IL-6, signiﬁcantly inhibited the prometastatic effects of
cyclophosphamide. It should be noted that anti-CCL2 antibody is speciﬁc to the murine host–derived CCL2, and
does not cross-react with prostate cancer-derived human
CCL2, and that the neutralizing antibody was administered in
only 3 dosages before tumor cell inoculation. Collectively,

www.aacrjournals.org

these data suggest that neutralizing CCL2 reconditions
the premetastatic host microenvironment induced by
chemotherapy.
Although the present data show the efﬁcacy of anti-CCL2
antibody in the cyclophosphamide-induced prostate cancer
bone metastasis model, increased expression of CCL2 (and
subsequent expansion of myeloid cells) may not be the only
mechanism of promoting metastasis after cyclophosphamide
treatment. The ﬁrst alternative explanation for the prometastatic effects of cyclophosphamide is that it could be mediated
by the effects on bone cells. Given that inhibition of osteoclasts
reversed the effects of granulocyte macrophage colony—
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on metastasis in a mouse model
(38), it is possible that the effects of CCL2 neutralizing antibody
in these results were, in part, mediated by inhibition of
osteoclastogenesis. Second, while our results failed to conﬁrm
the causal role of cyclophosphamide-induced endothelial damage in metastasis, the possibility still remains for further
investigation. Cyclophosphamide is currently being tested for
efﬁcacy as antiangiogenic therapy, and disruption of endothelial barrier function can promote extravasation of tumor cells
in the metastatic microenvironment. Previously, Shirota and
Tavassoli showed that cyclophosphamide induces endothelial
damage detectable by electron microscopy, and destroys the
integrity of bone marrow sinus endothelium (indicated by red
blood cells in the extravascular space), leading to enhanced
engraftment of bone marrow transplantation (28). Therefore,
cyclophosphamide effects on metastasis may be varied in
different dosing schedules (i.e., metronomic low dose) or
different tumor models.
In conclusion, this study showed that priming the murine
host with cyclophosphamide altered the bone microenvironment, leading to promotion of prostate cancer bone
metastasis. In addition, suppression of host CCL2 by antibody treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the adverse effects of
cyclophosphamide.
