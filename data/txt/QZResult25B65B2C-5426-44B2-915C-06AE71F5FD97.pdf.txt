Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx
and Pharynx

and Ollivier Laccourreye, MD4

BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to determine the long-term outcomes of patients with
squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and pharynx who were treated with platin-based exclusive chemotherapy (EC) after they achieved a complete clinical response (CCR) to induction chemotherapy.
METHODS: One hundred forty-two who achieved a CCR after platin-based induction chemotherapy were
treated exclusively with additional chemotherapy, and 98.6% were followed for a minimum of 3 years or
until death. Thirty-five patients had >10 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The survival rates at 1 year and 5
years were 95.8% and 61.2%, respectively. The main causes of death were metachronous second primary
tumors (n ¼ 27) and intercurrent disease (n ¼ 21). Death related to EC was not encountered, and only 2
patients (1.4%) had grade 4 toxicity. In multivariate analysis, primary tumor arising outside the glottic larynx (P ¼ .0001) and a Charlson comorbidity index >1 (P ¼ .0001) were associated with a statistically significant reduction in survival. The 1-year and 5-year Kaplan-Meier local control estimates were 76.1% and
50.7%, respectively. Salvage treatment resulted in an observed final local control rate of 93% that varied
from 97.2% in patients who had glottic cancer to 88.7% in patients who had tumor originating from other
sites (P ¼ .097). Combined chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) allowed for the successful
modulation of local therapy in 54.9% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: For selected patients, EC may provide
long-term, durable disease control. For patients who developed recurrent disease after EC, this approach
did not diminish survival and maintained function in the majority of patients. Future work should be
directed toward select markers of response to PF chemotherapy with which to identify those patients who

Since its introduction by Decker et al1 and Jacobs et
2

al, the use of platin-based induction chemotherapy has
evolved from experimental therapy to an integral part of
the comprehensive care3-6 of patients with invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. Beginning in 1981, we began to use induction chemotherapy
before conservation laryngeal surgery.7,8 Since then, our
experience as well as that of others3-5,9-14 has demonstrated that the use of platin-based induction chemotherapy before conventional treatment results in a 20% to
40% rate of complete clinical response (CCR). On the basis of these encouraging results, a novel approach based on
the use of platin-based chemotherapy alone termed
‘‘exclusive chemotherapy’’ (EC) was pioneered at our
institution. There were no specific criteria that were used
initially to select patients for this approach. At first, certain patients who had no residual cancer after a CCR
refused surgery or radiation but would consent to further
chemotherapy. Nonetheless, using this empiric approach,
first, we studied a series of 21 patients with glottic cancer.7
The initial results achieved were confirmed in a larger
cohort of 67 patients with selected SCC of the larynx and
hypopharynx who had achieved a CCR.8
In this final report, we review all patients who
received EC at our department from 1981 to 2004, resulting in a much larger cohort of 142 patients with a longer
duration of follow-up. We critically appraise this experience to identify the limits and benefits of this experimental approach and, in particular, to determine the
feasibility of extending this approach more broadly to
patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). We hypothesized that certain patients with HNC would achieve longterm, durable remission with chemotherapy alone. For
those patients with residual disease after EC, we studied
whether or not the systematic use of additional chemotherapy after CCR would allow us to down-modulate the
intensity of local therapy. Herein, we present the results of
this novel experience in terms of overall survival (OS),
local recurrence-free survival, causes of death, and chemotherapy-related toxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 1981 to 2004, 2271 patients with a previously
untreated, moderately to well differentiated, invasive SCC
of the larynx or pharynx (excluding the nasopharynx and

velum) were managed with an induction therapy regimen
at our institution. Of these patients, 23.9% (545 of 2271)
achieved a CCR. A CCR after induction chemotherapy
was defined as the absence of tumor on control endoscopy
as well as by corroborating radiographic studies after
induction chemotherapy. Of the 545 complete clinical
responders, 26.1% (142 of 545) were managed with EC
and are analyzed in the current retrospective series.
In this inception cohort of 142 patients, the tumor
originated from the glottic larynx in 71 patients, from the
nonglottic endolarynx in 9 patients, from the epilarynx15,16 or the hypopharynx in 43 patients, and from the
oropharynx in 19 patients. The epilarynx is defined as
mucosa along the ‘‘margins’’ of the larynx as it transitions
into the surrounding pharynx. The epilarynx is divided
into the anterior epilarynx (the suprahyoid epiglottis), the
lateral epilarynx (aryepiglottic folds), and the posterior
epilarynx (arytenoids).15,16 Table 1 documents the TNM
staging according to the 2002 International Union
Against Cancer staging classification system.17 Metachronous second primary tumors were defined according to
the criteria first proposed by Warren and Gates18 and by
Nikolaou et al19; thus, each newly diagnosed tumor was
located least 2 cm from the treated field margin of the previous tumor.
Internal review board protocols were not used routinely in France when this approach was first begun; therefore, the decision to use EC was made after a
multidisciplinary discussion in which the roles and benefits of standard therapy (surgery, radiation, chemoradiation) as well as the dangers of chemotherapy were
presented to the patient. Table 2 documents the demographic and comorbidity status according to the Charlson20 index-weighted score (excluding the index cancer).

Before starting the induction chemotherapy regimen, 93 patients (65.5%) were considered amenable to
radiation therapy or to a partial resection sparing the
physiologic functions of phonation, respiration, and deglutition. These patients were defined as Group A.
Among the remaining 49 patients, 43 (30.3%) were amenable only to a surgical resection that did not spare the
physiologic functions of the tumor-laden organ (mandibular resection for 4 patients with oropharyngeal cancer or
permanent stoma and loss of voice for 42 patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer). These patients were
categorized as Group B. The last 6 patients with CCR
(4.2%) were considered unresectable before the induction
chemotherapy regimen and were defined as Group C.
The number of induction chemotherapy cycles varied
from 2 to 3 (depending on the toxicity and the response).
The number of cycles and the agents that patients received
were not standardized. The treatment was tailored individually to each patient’s tumor classification and performance
status. Overall, the total number of courses used for EC varied from 1 to 17 (median, 5 courses). The median course
duration was 5 days. Our main and current regimen
consisted of cisplatin (25 mg/m2 daily) and 5-fluorouracil
(1 g/m2 daily) delivered through an implanted venous (subclavian vein) access device (Baxter HealthCare Corporation,
Deerfield Ill). Over time, other agents, as depicted in Table

3, also were used. The total dosage of the drugs delivered
varied for each patient. Neither taxanes nor long-term maintenance therapies, such as 13-cis-retinoic acid, were used.
The dosages were adjusted to tolerance. Antiemetics and
oral hyperhydration (2 L daily) were used routinely during
the treatment course. Induction chemotherapy was administered with a 15-day to 21-day hiatus between courses (the
ultimate interval was determined by toxicity). Clinical
examinations, blood counts, and serum chemistry performed 15 days after each course allowed for the analysis of
cumulative toxicity (Table 4) according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group criteria.21 Follow-up was calculated as
the time from a patient’s first appointment in our department for the index SCC until the date of either last contact
or death. The median follow-up was 5 years and 3 months.
Ninety-nine patients were followed for a mean duration of
3 years or until death. Thirty-four patients had >10 years of
follow-up, and 1 patient was followed for 19 years.
For the current study, the modulation of local therapy was considered successful after EC when 1) patients
who had unresectable tumors could receive conservation
or nonconservation treatment, 2) patients who required a
total laryngectomy or composite resection could undergo
a conservation surgical approach or radiation therapy,
or 3) a patient who initially was amenable to a conservation surgical approach or radiation therapy achieved local
control with EC alone. Unsuccessful modulation of local
therapy was defined as a patient who was amenable to
conservation therapy before EC but underwent total laryngectomy or composite transmandibular resection or a
patient who had any resectable tumor before EC and
became unresectable after EC.

The variables under analysis are listed in Tables 5
and 6. The data were summarized using standard descriptive statistics and frequency tabulations. Associations
between categorical variables were assessed by using crosstabulation, chi-square tests, or Fisher exact tests, and either Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests were
used to assess the differences between patients’ clinical
characteristics with respect to continuous variables.22 The
distribution of OS was defined from the initiation of EC
to death; the time to local recurrence was defined from the

initiation of EC to local recurrence; and the time to lymph
node recurrence was defined from the initiation of EC to
lymph node recurrence. The distribution of OS, local recurrence-free survival, and lymph node recurrence-free
survival was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier
method. The log-rank test was used to test the differences
in survival between groups. Regression analyses of survival
data based on the Cox proportional hazards model were
conducted on survival data. The assumption of proportional hazards was examined for each variable.23 No

statistically significant. All tests were 2-sided. All analyses
were conducted in SAS statistical software (version 9.1;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and S-PLUS (Insightful

RESULTS
Survival
The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year Kaplan-Meier actuarial
survival estimates were 95.8%, 72.8%, and 61.2%,
respectively. Over the course of this longitudinal study,
77 deaths (54.2%) were recorded. The causes of death
were metachronous second primary tumors (27 patients),
intercurrent disease (21 patients), local recurrence (10
patients), distant metastasis (8 patients), and lymph node
recurrence (4 patients). In the remaining 7 patients, the
cause of death was unknown, but there was no evidence of
the primary cancer at the time of death.

arising from the glottic larynx had improved OS compared with patients who had tumors arising in the epilarynx and hypopharynx (P < .0001) (Fig. 1). There was a
significant statistical decrease in survival for patients who
were not staged initially as N0 (P ¼ .0032), and this was
especially true when patients who were staged as N0 were
compared with patients who were staged as N2 and N3
(P ¼ .0051 and P ¼ .0135, respectively) (Fig. 2). Medical
comorbidity played a significant role in OS; compared
with patients who had a Charlson comorbidity index of 0
or 1, patients who had a Charlson comorbidity index 2
had worse OS (P < .0001) (Fig. 3).
Tumor site and medical comorbidity remained significant in the final multivariate model. Patients who had
primary tumors arising from the glottic larynx had better
OS (P < .0001; hazards ratio [HR], 0.2.97 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.175-0.505]) compared with
patients who had primary tumors arising from the epilarynx and hypopharynx. No significant differences were
detected for patients who had tumors arising from the
oropharynx or supraglottic larynx compared with patients
who had primary tumor arising from the epilarynx and

In univariate analysis, as depicted in Table 6, several

courses of therapy (P ¼ .0072) (Fig. 4) and high total
dose of 5-fluorouracil (37 mg/m2; P ¼ .0014) (Fig. 5)
were associated statistically with increased rates of local recurrence. The median number of cycles of chemotherapy
associated with local control was 5, and patients who
received >5 cycles had an increased risk of local recurrence in univariate analysis (P ¼ .0072). In multivariate
analysis, only high-dose 5-fluorouracil (37 mg/m2) had
a significant effect on local recurrence (P ¼ .0014; HR,

treatment varied according to the group classification
based on the conventional treatment available before the
start of induction therapy. Fifty-seven of 93 patients
(61%) who were considered amenable to a conservative
approach (Group A) achieved local control after EC without the need for radiation and/or conservation surgery.
Thirty-one of 43 patients (72%) who initially were amenable to a nonconservative surgical approach (Group B)
achieved local control (either with EC or with a salvage
conservation approach). Of the 6 patients who presented
initially with unresectable disease (Group C), 4 patients
had local control with EC, and 1 patient had local control
with salvage conservation surgery. Conversely, 11 patients
(7.7%) required more intensive LR therapy (2 patients) or
became unresectable (9 patients).

Consequences of Local Recurrence

Toxicity

In the current series, salvage treatment was received by 54 of
65 patients (83.1%) with local recurrence. Of the remaining
11 patients, palliative treatment was offered to 10 patients,
and the treatment modality for 1 patient was unknown.
The overall final (observed) control rate for patients after
salvage (and post-EC) was 93%. The final local control rate
after salvage therapy varied from 97.2% in patients who had
glottic cancer to 88.7% in patients who had tumors originating from other locations (Fisher exact test; P ¼ .097).
Lymph node recurrence was more likely to occur in patients
who had local recurrence than in patients who achieved
local control (P ¼ .0003, HR, 4.611 [95% CI, 2.02510.499]), and the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year Kaplan-Meier
actuarial lymph node control estimate remained at 100% in
patients without local recurrence compared with 91.8%,
79.7%, and 74.7%, respectively in patients with local recurrence. Patients with local recurrence were more likely to
have progression to distant metastasis (P ¼ .041; HR, 4.866
[95% CI, 1.065-22.235]).

Table 4 documents toxicity associated with the administration of EC. Overall, 30 patients (21.1%) experienced
grade 3 toxicity, and 2 patients had grade 4 toxicity
(1.4%). Eight patients (5.6%) reported neurologic sequelae, including peripheral neuropathy in 5 patients and
intermittent dysesthesias in 3 patients. Eleven patients
(7.7%) had central venous catheter-related complications.
Toxicity-related and/or chemotherapy-related complications did not lead to death.

Since 1981, at the University of Paris V, we have systemically studied the use of platin-based induction chemotherapy for patients with cancers of the larynx and pharynx.
For selected patients who achieved a CCR after platinbased induction chemotherapy, neither radiation nor conservation laryngopharyngeal surgery was performed.
Instead, these patients went on to receive additional cycles
of chemotherapy and were observed. Many were cured.
These small pilot studies7,8 suggested the feasibility of
using EC to achieve durable, long-term locoregional control without diminishing OS.7 Since then, 2 other groups
have explored this approach and have documented similar
results in patients classified with N0/N1 disease.24,25
We present the results from 142 patients with SCC
of the larynx and pharynx who received EC during the
years from 1981 through 2004. This large cohort

represents 26.8% of the patients who achieved a CCR after a platin-based induction chemotherapy regimen during the same period at our institution.
Although all of the patients we studied had SCC
originating from the larynx or pharynx and were treated
with a platin/fluorouracil-based regimen, the study population was diverse in terms of tumor site, tumor and
lymph node classification, medical comorbidity, chemotherapy regimen, and duration of treatment. However,
despite this heterogeneity, we were able to analyze a large
number of patients over a long duration of follow-up;
98.6% of these patients were followed for a mean duration of 3 years, and 35 patients for >10 years. The size of
the study and this lengthy duration of follow-up provide a
unique opportunity to determine clinical parameters that
are correlated significantly with local control and/or survival after EC.
In the current series, the rates of survival achieved at
1 year, 3 years, and 5 years were 94.5%, 71.5%, and
60.2%, respectively. The main cause of death was metachronous second primary tumors and intercurrent disease,
which were much more common than local recurrence,
distant metastasis, and/or lymph node recurrence. The definitive use of surgery and radiation therapy was tailored
for patients who had residual disease after maximally
cytoreductive therapy. Such an approach may diminish
acute and long-term swallowing, airway, and speech dysfunction, which are observed commonly with concurrent
chemoradiation.26 Finally, as in previous studies from our
department7,8 and from other institutions24,25 the toxicity
of EC was tolerable and did not result in death (Table 4).
With this large cohort, we were able to identify (Table 5) several clinical variables that were associated with
diminished survival. Patients who had tumors arising
from the glottic larynx had improved OS compared with
3916

patients who had tumors arising in other sites (P <
.0001). There was a significant decrease in survival noted
in patients who did not initially have N0 disease (P ¼
.01), and this trend was especially true when patients who
had N0 disease were compared with the few patients who
had N3 disease (P < .001). There also was a significant
decline in survival (P ¼ .0007) noted when the Charlson
comorbidity index20 increased from 0 to 5. The development of a metachronous second primary tumor was associated with reduced survival (P ¼ .001). Take together,
these data suggest that the best patients for EC are those
who have tumors originating from the glottic larynx, N0
lymph node status, and low medical comorbidity status.
This conclusion drawn from our univariate analysis is reinforced by the multivariate analysis, which demonstrated
that primary tumor arising outside the glottic larynx and a
Charlson comorbidity index20 score >1 were associated
with a statistically significant reduction in survival. (Table
5) The lymph node status did not appear in the multivariate analysis because of the finding that very few patients
did not have N0 disease. Also, if this approach is used in
patients who have nonglottic tumors classified as N0,
then we believe that the neck should be treated up-front,
because lymph node failure (P ¼ .002) and the subsequent development of distant metastasis (P ¼ .004) were
associated significantly with diminished survival.
Two clinical parameters were associated with diminished local recurrence-free survival (Table 6): patients who
received a total dose of 5-fluorouracil 37 mg/m2 and
patients who received >5 cycles. This is a major finding
when we compare the results achieved in the current report
with the results from our previous reports,7,8 in which multivariate analysis was not performed. These 2 findings suggest that, in certain individuals, there is a threshold dose
past which further systemic therapy is likely not effective,

both in terms of the dose of 5-fluorouracil given and in
terms of extending the number of cycles past 5. These limitations of EC should be considered carefully in the design of
future trials examining this approach.
Overall, 60 patients developed a local recurrence after
EC in the current series. By using the Kaplan-Meier27
actuarial life-table method, actuarial local control estimates
of 73.5% at 1 year, 53.3% at 3 years, and 50.3% at 5 years
were achieved in our series, and no local recurrences were
noted after the fifth year. For each group (Groups A-C),
local control after EC alone was inferior to what has been
described in the literature and accepted as the standard of
care. However, when local recurrences developed, salvage
treatment was possible in 83.3% of patients, resulting in an
overall observed 85.6% local control rate. However, salvage
treatment after EC was quite effective in many patients and
was very much within the standard of care—especially for
patients who had tumors of the glottic larynx. In fact, we
observed that the final local control rate for patients who
had glottic cancer (96%) was significantly better (P ¼
.0001) compared with the rate for patients who had tumors
originating from other locations (71%). This finding suggests that further studies using EC must use extremely rigorous and close follow-up before this approach is
implemented widely.
Indeed, despite these promising results, the use of EC
should not be considered as a standard of care for the treatment of patients with HNC. Multi-institutional, prospective studies of EC must be performed before such an
approach is used widely or advocated. A single-institution
experience in a large referral center could be performed in
which close multidisciplinary follow-up is possible. Close
observation by the physician for local or regional recurrence
and patients’ commitment to this regimen is absolutely
essential for this approach. Further prospective evaluation in
the setting of a clinical trial must be done.
Furthermore, not all patients with HNC are or
should be amenable to this EC approach. We wish to
highlight the potential advantages of EC, which advocates
a purely neoadjuvant approach. With advances in
genomics, proteomics, and systems biology, we believe
that biomarkers can be identified that predict these important outcomes, as has been done in other tobaccorelated cancers, such as lung cancer.28 Future prospective
and multicenter trials of EC can be used to select these
biomarkers and, thus, to identify which patients are best

(or least) suited to receive chemotherapy alone as definitive treatment.
Some may argue that such an approach, in the face
of highly effective radiation therapy with or without
chemotherapy, is not indicated. However, even in the era
of epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy,26,29
the mounting toxicity of current therapeutic regimens26,30,31 suggests that we should continue to explore
alternative approaches for this challenging disease. For
selected patients with laryngopharyngeal carcinoma, EC
may be worth further consideration, especially for those
patients who have tumors of the glottic larynx.
In conclusion, the current data confirmed that EC
can achieve long-term remission and locoregional control
without surgery or radiation in selected patients who have
laryngopharyngeal SCC. Even for those patients who initially responded to EC and later developed recurrent disease, standard salvage therapy still was feasible in the
majority. In fact, for this whole cohort, OS survival was
comparable to results reported with more standard treatment. Finally, EC has permitted us to successfully downmodulate the extent of LR therapy while achieving OS
benefits with a profile of treatment-related toxicity.
