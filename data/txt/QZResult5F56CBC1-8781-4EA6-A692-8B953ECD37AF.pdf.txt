ABSTRACT
The efficacy of glioblastoma chemotherapy is not satisfactory; therefore,
a new medication is expected to improve outcomes. As much evidence shows
that antidepressants decrease cancer incidence and improve patients’ quality
of life, we therefore attempted to explore the potential for fluoxetine to be
used to treat GBM and its possible underlying mechanism. The expression level
of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)
was determined using immunohistochemical staining and PCR analysis.
The mechanism of fluoxetine-induced apoptosis of gliomas was elucidated.
Computer modeling and a binding assay were conducted to investigate the
interaction of fluoxetine with the AMPAR. The therapeutic effect of fluoxetine
was evaluated using an animal model. We found that fluoxetine directly
bound to AMPAR, thus inducing transmembrane Ca2+ influx. The rise in
the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) causes mitochondrial Ca2+
overload, thereby triggering apoptosis. AMPARs are excessively expressed
in glioma tissues, suggesting that fluoxetine specifically executes glioma
cells. Our in vivo study revealed that fluoxetine suppressed the growth of
glioblastomas in brains of Nu/Nu mice, an effect similar to that produced by
temozolomide. Our preclinical studies suggest fluoxetine, a commonly used
antidepressant, might be selectively toxic to gliomas and could provide a new
approach for managing this disease.

INTRODUCTION

clinical and therapeutic aspects, the poor prognosis with
gliomas involves different factors such as accessibility
to surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy [1, 4]. The
anatomic location of gliomas makes it very difficult to
surgically remove them, and it is impossible to avoid any

damage to vital brain regions with radiotherapy. Moreover,
the efficacy of chemotherapy is often impeded by the
poor efficacy of drug delivery due to the diffusion barrier
maintained by the blood-brain-barrier (BBB); it was
reported that nearly 98% of small molecules and 100%
of large molecules tested are incapable of passing through
the BBB [4-6]. Unfortunately, the limited number of
medications that are able to pass through the BBB cannot
efficiently differentiate between healthy and cancerous
cells [3, 6]. This causes serious side effects. Therefore, a
drug which can pass through the BBB and selectively kill
brain tumor cells is highly necessary.
Similar to other cancers, gliomas possess aberrant
cell signaling that enhances their malignant behavior [7,
8]. Glutamate receptors, which are important for survival,
differentiation, proliferation, and migration of cells during
neural development, are highly expressed in gliomas, and
are correlated with the malignancy of gliomas [9]. Recent
reports showed that glutamate receptor antagonists inhibit
cell proliferation of colon cancer, breast cancer, and lung
cancer, and that the antiproliferative effect of the glutamate
receptor antagonists is ascribed to their suppressive effect
on cell division concomitant with an increase in cell
death [9-11]. Nevertheless, due to their poor efficacy in
penetrating the BBB, the glutamate receptor antagonists
have had limited success in clinical applications to brain
tumors [10].
Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for
cancer patients suffering from depressive disorders that
develop in later stages. Recently, retrospective studies
showed that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) reduce
the cancer risk of gliomas and that a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), used as a antidepressant, has an
antiproliferative or cytotoxic effect on certain cancers, due
to its ability to pass through the BBB and directly carry
out its pharmaceutical effects in regions of the brain. It
should be noted that most antidepressants are much safer
than chemotherapeutic agents. With these characteristics,
antidepressants are promising leads for glioma treatment.
Therefore, we attempted to explore the potential for
antidepressants to be used to treat GBM and its possible
underlying mechanism.
The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)
is well-controlled in the cytoplasm, is well-regulated
across organelles under physiological conditions, and is
involved in many biological functions such as secretion,
contraction, metabolism, excitation, etc [12]. However,
an abnormally prolonged increase in [Ca2+]i may induce
cell damage, and even trigger cell death [13]. Although
the pathways underlying cell death are complicated,
mechanisms associated with changes in the mitochondrial
membrane permeability were shown to play important
roles in cell death triggered by a mitochondrial matrix
Ca2+ overload [14, 15]. Interestingly, it was shown that
an SSRI increased [Ca2+]i in different cancer cells such
as oral cancer cells, prostate cancer cells, and bladder
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer cells, and the elevation of [Ca2+]i was mediated
by either transmembrane Ca2+ influx or Ca2+ release
from the internal stores, or both [16-18]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that fluoxetine, one of the most prescribed
SSRI, will increase the [Ca2+]i, thereby triggering apoptosis
in gliomas. In this study, we provide evidence showing a
novel antitumor function of fluoxetine in gliomas and its
possible underlying molecular mechanisms.

RESULTS
Fluoxetine-induced glioblastoma cell death is
Ca2+-dependent and requires transmembrane Ca2+
influx
Therapeutic doses of fluoxetine for depression
patients are in the range of 20-60 mg/day and brain
concentration of fluoxetine can reach up to about 30 μM
[19-22]. Thus, we first investigated the effects of 0-30
μM fluoxetine application on the viability of glioma cells.
Using glioma cell lines derived from both rats (C6) and
humans (U87, GBM8401, and Hs683) as models, we
found that 25-30 μM fluoxetine application decreased the
viability of glioma cells, but had no effect on rat primary
astrocytes and neurons. Both the MTT and LDH assays
showed similar results (Fig. 1A-B).
Previous studies showed that SSRI antidepressants
increase [Ca2+]i in a variety of cells such as oral cells,
prostatic cells, and prefrontal cortex astrocytes and that a
sustained increase in [Ca2+]i induces cell damage and may
even cause cell death [16-18]. However, little is known
about the role of Ca2+ signaling in fluoxetine-induced
death of glioma cells. We therefore examined whether
fluoxetine-induced glioma cell death was associated
with changes in [Ca2+]i. Fluorescence Ca2+ imaging with
Fluo-3-AM revealed that fluoxetine evoked an increase in
[Ca2+]i in U87 and GMB8401 cells, but not in rat primary
astrocytes (Fig. 1C). To further determine what pathways
(i.e., transmembrane Ca2+ influx vs. Ca+2 released from
internal Ca2+ stores) contribute to fluoxetine-induced
[Ca2+]i elevation, cells were placed in medium with zero
Ca2+ added or pretreated with 2-APB, a blocker of the ER
calcium channel, followed by fluoxetine application. As
shown in Fig. 1D-E, fluoxetine exhibited less cytotoxicity
toward cells cultured in calcium-free medium, but
retained a similar toxic effect following pretreatment with
2-APB. Collectively, these data suggest that the influx of
extracellular Ca2+, not the internal release of Ca2+, plays
an important role in fluoxetine-induced glioma cell death.

cells exposed to fluoxetine (Fig. 2A). Fluorescent Ca2+
imaging with Fura-2-AM revealed that fluoxetine elevated
[Ca2+]i in glioma cells within seconds, and the elevation of
[Ca2+]i was abolished when cells were pretreated with
NBQX (Fig. 2B-C).

Multiple subtypes of glutamate receptor were shown
to be expressed in glioblastoma specimens, and are critical
in promoting the malignancy of gliomas [9]. Ionotropic
glutamate receptors, in particular the AMPA receptor
(AMPAR), NMDA receptor, and kinate receptor, are Ca2+permeable. To determine which subtype(s) of glutamate
receptor participated in fluoxetine-induced Ca2+ influx,
we pretreated glioma cells with a specific antagonist (i.e.,
NBQX, an AMPAR blocker, MK-801, an NMDA receptor
blocker, or NS-102, a kinate receptor blocker) followed
by fluoxetine application, and then measured the cell
viability. We found that pretreatment with NBQX, but

expression level. We found that the expression level
of GluR1 was elevated in both glioma cell lines and
patient specimens, compared to controls (Fig. 2D-E).
Moreover, the immunofluorescence image shown that
GluR1 in glioblastoma cell were mainly expressed on
the cell surface. On the contrary, in astrocyte, GluR1
were expressed mostly in the cytosol (Fig. 2F). The

flow cytometry analysis also confirmed that GluR1
expression level in glioblastoma cell lines were higher
than in astrocytes (Fig. 2G). The ratio of AMPAR
on the cell membrane to intracellular pool is highly
regulated. In fact, AMPAR could only transport calcium
when it located on the cell membrane [26]. It indicated
that functional (membrane) GluR1 expression level in
glioblastoma cell line were higher than that in astrocyte.

level is positively correlated with increased grades of

that fluoxetine-induced calcium influx and cell death of

factors, thereby triggering the apoptotic pathway [1315]. To examine the effect of fluoxetine-induced Ca2+
influx on mitochondrial integrity, we examined the
MMP and subcellular distribution of cytochrome c.
Our flow cytometric analysis showed that fluoxetine
respectively decreased the MMP by 62.11%±6.47% and
79.83%±12.86% in U87 and GBM8401 cells (Fig. 4A-B).
The Western blot analysis revealed that after fluoxetine
treatment, a significant amount of cytochrome c was
released from the mitochondrial matrix and was present
in the cytosolic fraction, accompanied by activation of
caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP). On the other hand, removal of Ca2+ from the
extracellular medium during fluoxetine application
abolished the apoptotic events as described above (Fig.

suggestion that fluoxetine induces apoptosis in a caspasedependent manner (Fig. 4D-E).
To further confirm the notion that AMPARs play
an important role in fluoxetine-induced apoptosis, the
same experiments as shown in Fig. 4C were conducted
in glioma cells in which GluR1 was knocked down
by siRNA. Fluoxetine-induced apoptosis was blocked
by GluR1 knockdown (Fig. 4F). These data suggest
that apoptosis triggered by fluoxetine involves a
mitochondrion-dependent pathway and contains GluR1

carried out surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy
to analyze the binding affinity and kinetic rate constants
of ligand-receptor interactions. As shown in Fig. 5C-D,
the sensorgram demonstrates that fluoxetine bound to
GluR1 in a dose-dependent manner, with rate constants,
Ka = 4.8 × 104 M-1 s-1 and Kd = 1.27× 10-3 s-1, and with
binding affinity, KD = 2.66 × 10-8 M. These data indicate
that fluoxetine can directly bind to GluR1.

Fluoxetine directly binds to the GluR1

In order to explore the in vivo relevance of our
findings obtained in vitro, we generated tumor xenografts
by subcutaneously injecting 5 × 106 U87 cells into
nude mice. When the tumor size reached 100 mm3, the
mice were administered fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day, o.p.)

administration, the tumor was considerably reduced on

To determine whether fluoxetine can act as a ligand
and directly bind to GluR1, the interaction of fluoxetine
with GluR1 was simulated by computer modeling. An in

the same binding sites, i.e., they both bound to the same
ligand-binding domain of GluR1 (Fig. 5A-B). To further

day 6, and had become undetectable by day 12, compared
to the controls. Both fluoxetine and TMZ treatments
showed similar results (Supplementary Fig. S1). To
address whether fluoxetine was able to pass through the
BBB and carry out its antitumor activity intracranially,
we implanted 106 luciferase-expressing U87 cells or 2 ×
105 luciferase-expressing GBM8401 cells into the right
striatum of nude mice. The bioluminescent signal revealed
that intracranial tumor growth was significantly inhibited
in fluoxetine- and TMZ-treated mice (Fig. 6A-D). The
data showed that fluoxetine suppressed the growth of
intracranial glioblastoma brain tumors.
To examine whether fluoxetine had damaging effects
on normal brain tissues, mice brains from fluoxetine- and
TMZ-treated mice and control mice were coronally sliced
and then inspected after H&E staining or immunostaining
(Fig. 6E). There was a large amount of cleaved caspase-3
in brain slices from both fluoxetine- and TMZ-treated
mice compared to those of the control group (Fig. 6F).
Most importantly, the cleaved caspase-3 signals were

specifically expressed in the brain tumor region, while
only weak signals were present in the normal brain region.
These data suggests that fluoxetine specifically damages
glioblastoma cells without having deleterious effects on
normal brain regions.

DISCUSSION
Gliomas are one of the most aggressive and common
primary malignant brain tumors. The median survival
time of a glioma patient who receives treatment is only
about 12~15 months, indicating that current medication
is not effective [1, 4]. One possible reason for this short
survival time could be that many chemotherapeutic
drugs commonly used to treat other cancers have poor
efficacy in passing through the diffusion barrier of the
BBB [4, 5]. This results in a marked reduction of drug
delivery to the targeted brain region, thereby limiting its
clinical application in brain tumor treatment [4]. On the
other hand, the few drugs that are able to pass through

Fig. 7: Schematic overview. Fluoxetine activates AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are highly expressed by glioma cells compared

to neuroglia cells, causing transmembrane Ca2+ influx. The sustained increase in [Ca2+]i induces mitochondrial membrane permeability
change, resulting in the release of apoptogenic factors (e.g., cytochrome c) and the formation of apoptosomes, consequently leading to
caspase activation.

the BBB cannot efficiently differentiate between healthy
and cancerous cells, thus causing serious side effects.
One typical example is TMZ, a first-line brain tumor
chemotherapeutic drug. A drug which can pass through
the BBB and specifically induce cell death in glioma cells
has been highly anticipated.
This is the first study to show that AMPARs were
excessively expressed in glioma cells and that fluoxetine,
through its direct binding to GluR1, activated AMPARs
and evoked robust Ca2+ influx. An acute increase in
[Ca2+]i causes mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, thereby
triggering apoptosis (Fig. 7). Moreover, our in vivo
study showed that fluoxetine suppressed the growth of
gliomas in brains of Nu/Nu mice, an effect similar to that
produced by TMZ. Taken together, our study indicates that
fluoxetine is a safe and potential drug that could provide a
new approach for managing gliomas.
Fluoxetine, a specific SSRI, is one of the most
popular antidepressants and has been used for decades.
The mechanism by which fluoxetine treats depression has
long been ascribed to its inhibitory action on serotonin
transporters. Blockade of serotonin reuptake results in an
increase in the serotonin concentration at synaptic clefts,
which in turn activates neurons and relieves depressive
symptoms. Interestingly, it was first shown by Abdul
et al. using prostate carcinoma cell lines as a model
that SSRIs, including both fluoxetine and zimelidine,
inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer[27]. A
study by Levkovitz et al. indicated that SSRI and MAOI
antidepressants activate caspase-3 and induce apoptosis
in rat glioma cell lines [28]. However, the underlying
mechanisms were not elucidated. In 2010, Sivan Tzadok
et al. showed a synergistic anti-proliferative effect of
imatinib when co-applied with fluoxetine, sertraline, or
perphenazine, as tested in human glioblastoma cell lines
[29]. Since FDA-approved medications is more safety
and cost-effective than new agents, the novel use of
old drugs for cancer therapy became a more acceptable
strategy in the pharmaceutical study [30, 31]. Recently,
a new conceptually glioma treatment approach based on
combining temozolomide with nine repurposed drugs,
including a SSRI antidepressant, was proposed [32, 33].
Epidemiological studies conducted in both Britain
and Canada showed that antidepressants reduce the cancer
risk in colon cancer and glioma patients, although some
studies revealed that antidepressants might increase the
incidence of seizures [34-36]. Previous clinical trials
indicated that paroxetine and citalopram markedly
improved cancer patients’ quality of life [37, 38].
Additionally, a retrospective review suggested that using
SSRI antidepressants, including citalopram, escitalopram,
fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, for
glioma treatment did not adversely affect survival rates
[39]. Based on those studies, we attempted to identify
which SSRI antidepressants could be potentially used
for treating glioma cells and studied the underlying
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanisms.
Ishiuchi et al. indicated that the expression level
of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs was positively correlated
with the malignancy of gliomas [40]. Their study found
that malignant glioma cells secreted glutamate into the
extracellular space in an autocrine or paracrine manner,
resulting in the activation of Ca2+-permeable AMPAR and
Akt pathways. This facilitated the growth of glioma cells
and increased their ability to migrate. Our study showed
that fluoxetine directly binds to AMPARs, causing an
elevation in [Ca2+]i. The rise in [Ca2+]i was so rapid that the
mitochondrial matrix had already been overloaded with
Ca2+ before activation of the Akt pathway occurred, and
then as a consequence, apoptosis was triggered. Because
AMPARs are excessively expressed by glioma cells,
fluoxetine was expected to induce massive death of glioma
cells through its interaction with AMPARs.
The monoamine hypothesis states that depression
is due to the dysfunctional homeostasis of monoamine
levels in the brain. It was previously believed that the
administration of SSRI, MAOI, or TCA antidepressants
increases the concentration of monoamines at the synaptic
cleft and thus relieves depressive symptoms. Later,
Svenningsson et al. proposed a different mechanism
suggesting that fluoxetine might have a modulatory role
on the dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein
of Mr 32,000 (DAPRR-32) [41] and that an increase
in phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser-831 and Ser-845,
through activation of these pathways results in facilitation
of calcium influx, and activates the calcium/calmodulindependent kinase II pathway, which in turn enhances the
expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, leading to
a reduction in depressive symptoms.
We were the first group to report that fluoxetine
directly binds to GluR1 to evoke Ca2+ influx, subsequently
triggering apoptosis in glioma cells. Our findings differ
from those of previous studies which showed that
fluoxetine induces apoptosis in glioma cells in an indirect
manner through pathways involving the phosphorylation
of GluR1. Our findings, however, do not exclude those
mechanisms; indeed, both mechanisms may coexist and
have certain contributions to apoptotic signaling in glioma
cells.
Substantial evidence indicates that Ca2+-permeable
AMPARs play an important role in the etiology of many
nervous system diseases such as stroke, epilepsy, and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [42]. Although the molecular
mechanism responsible for degeneration remains unclear,
it is believed that neurons may secrete an enormous
amount of glutamate into the extracellular space, which,
once bound to Ca2+-permeable AMPARs, may induce
massive cell death. Note that, if the mechanism of action
of fluoxetine is similar to that of glutamate, then it is
expected that fluoxetine will cause some damage to the
nervous system; however, it has never been reported that
the use of fluoxetine exacerbates nervous system diseases.

This issue requires further investigation.
The most common sources of brain metastasis are
lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, renal cancer,
and melanomas, among others. The survival time of
patients is markedly reduced once brain metastasis occurs
[43]. As previous epidemiological studies suggest that
antidepressants might reduce cancer risks [34, 35, 37, 38],
future investigations into the expression level of GluR1 in
other cancer cells, especially for those in brain metastasis
cancer, and the effect of fluoxetine on other cancers
would be valuable. Given the data shown in this study
indicating that fluoxetine is a relatively safe and potential
pharmaceutical drug, further investigation is warranted.

Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) measurement
To measure the intracellular concentration, cells
were suspended and incubated with 5 µM Fura-2-AM
(Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37°C. Cells were
then placed in the cell chamber of a spectrofluorometer
(Hitachi FL Spectrophotometer F-4500) equipped
with dual excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm
to respectively measure the Ca2+-bound and -free
forms of Fura-2 at an emission wavelength of 510 nm.
The ratio of the fluorescence at the two wavelengths
(A340 nm/A380 nm) was used to calculate changes in [Ca2+]i as
previously described [45].
To capture real-time [Ca2+]i images, cells were
loaded with 5 µM Fluo-3-AM (Molecular Probes) for 45
min, and then immediately examined on a fluorescence
microscope (Olympus IX81 microscope).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Glioma tumor samples
Tissue samples were collected at Wan Fang Hospital
(Taiwan). All tissue samples and clinical information
were obtained as part of an Institutional Review Board
(IRB)-approved study of the molecular analysis on brain
tumors at Taipei Medical University. Brain tissue samples
included glioblastomas (n = 6) and those of the normal
brain (n = 3).

Cell culture

Measurement of the mitochondrial membrane
potential

Glioblastoma U87, C6, and Hs683 cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and
GBM8401 was obtained from Bioresource Collection and
Research Center of Taiwan. Those cell lines were grown
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (Biological Industries). Primary cortical neuron and
astrocyte cultures were prepared as previously described
[44]. The human glioma cell lines were authenticated
through cell morphology monitoring, growth curve
analysis and short tandem repeat profiling analysis in
2014. The characterization of primary cortical neuron,
primary astrocyte and C6 glioma cell line were confirmed
by NeuN, GFAP or S100 expression, respectively. For the
intracranial xenograft experiment, luciferase-expressing
U87 and GBM8401 cells were established by transfection
of a pGL4.51[luc2/CMV/Neo] vector (Promega) into the
cell lines.

Cells were treated with the indicated concentration
of fluoxetine for 24 h and then incubated with 40 nM
DiOC6(3) (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C. After treatment,
cells were washed and suspended in PBS. DiOC6(3)
fluorescence intensities were measured with a flow
cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson)

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and a real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with the TRI reagent
(Sigma) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Complementary (c)DNA was subjected to PCR with
primers that amplified GluR1-4 (GluR1-4 sense,
CCTTTGGCCTATGAGATCTGGATGTG and common
antisense, TCGTACCACCATTTGTTTTTCA). A second
PCR was performed with primers specific for GluR1
(GluR1 sense, AAGAGGGACGAGACCAGACAAC and
the common antisense one as used for first PCR) [40].
Real-time PCRs were carried out with specific
primers (GluR1 sense: GACGCCGGACCAACTACAC
and antisense: GCTGCAGGGACAAACTTATCA; and
GAPDH sense: GAAATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGG

Cell survival analysis
Cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay, and
cytotoxicity was analyzed by a lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) assay. Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.25
mg/mL MTT (Sigma) at 37°C for 1 hr and the MTTwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blot analysis

and antisense: GAGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCATG). The
expression of GAPDH was used as an internal control.

Cell lysates were prepared by suspending cells in
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet
P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.025% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 mM
PMSF). Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed
on
10%
sodium
dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide
gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with
specific antibodies (anti-cytochrome C, anti-α-tubulin
(Neomarker), anti-caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), anticaspase-3, anti-PARP (Imgenex), anti-GluR1 (Abcam) and
then quantified by the colorimetric substrates.

Immunofluorescence
For immunofluorescence analysis, cultured cells
were properly fixed and permeabilized. After blocked by
1% BSA, cells were incubated with anti-GluR1 antibody
overnight followed by incubated with FITC-conjugated
anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nuclei
were counterstained with DAPI. The images were
acquired using laser confocal microscope (Leica, TCS
SP5 Confocal Spectral Microscope Image System). For
flow cytometry analysis, cultured cells were incubated
with anti-GluR1 antibody under non-permeabilizing
and permeablizing conditions followed by incubated
with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Cells were washed and suspended in
PBS. Fluorescence intensities were measured with a flow
cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson).

Tissue array
Human tissue array of normal and glioma brain
tissues were obtained from US Biomax (Rockville, MD,
USA). Tissues sections were stained with anti-GluR1
antibody (Abcam) and revealed using a polymer detection
system kit (Leica Biosystems). The staining intensity was
blind rated from 1 (weak staining) to 4 (strong intensity of
staining) by pathologist.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy
SPR spectroscopy was used to analysis the binding
affinity and kinetic rate constants of a set of small molecule
interactions [46, 47]. Real-time biomolecular interactions
were analyzed by a Bio-Rad ProteOn™ XPR 36 protein
interaction array system (Bio-Rad). All procedures
followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, to
evaluate the association and dissociation kinetics of
fluoxetine and GluR1, increasing concentrations of
fluoxetine (10, 50, 100, 500, and 100 nM) were diluted
in PBST buffer and injected for 90 s followed by washing
in PBST for 270 s. Sensorgrams for binding interactions
were recorded in real time and analyzed after subtracting
the blank channel. The association rate constant (Ka),
dissociation rate constant (Kd), and equilibrium constant
(KD) were calculated by ProteOn Manager software (BioRad).

Animals
Male athymic nude mice at 5~6 weeks old were
obtained from BioLasco (Taiwan) and maintained
in a specific-pathogen-free facility. All experimental
procedures were approved by the Institute of Animal Care
and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University.

Tumor xenografts
Each animal was anesthetized with an i.p. injection
of xylazine (Sigma) and zolazepam (Zoletil 50, Virbac),
and then secured in a stereotaxic frame. Luciferaseexpressing U87 cells (106 cells in PBS) or GBM8401 cells
(2 × 105 cells in PBS) were intracranially implanted into
the right striatum. One week after implantation, mice were
treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day, o.p., Sigma) or
TMZ (5 mg/kg/day, i.p., Sigma). Luciferase activity was
analyzed on the indicated day by IVIS-200 and Living
Image Software (Caliper LifeSciences).

Computational molecular docking
The protein structure of GluR1 in the docking study
was predicted by homology modeling with Swiss-Model
Workshop [48, 49]. AutoDock 4.2 was used to calculate
the docking position and binding energy of fluoxetine or
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
(AMPA) to GluR1 [50]. We carried out the Lamarckian
genetic algorithm and set 2.5 x 106 evaluations and 100
runs for docking. The lowest binding energy and docking
position of fluoxetine and AMPA are visualized by The
PyMol Molecular Graphics System (Schrödinger).

Histology
Mice were subjected to deep anesthesia and then
transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS and 10%
formaldehyde. Sections were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin and rabbit-anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Abcam)
and revealed using a polymer detection system kit (Leica
