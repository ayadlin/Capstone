Abstract
The EGFR antibody cetuximab is used to treat numerous cancers, but intrinsic and acquired resistance to this
agent is a common clinical outcome. In this study, we show that overexpression of the oncogenic receptor tyrosine
kinase AXL is sufﬁcient to mediate acquired resistance to cetuximab in models of non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where AXL was overexpressed, activated, and
tightly associated with EGFR expression in cells resistant to cetuximab (CtxR cells). Using RNAi methods and
novel AXL-targeting agents, we found that AXL activation stimulated cell proliferation, EGFR activation, and
MAPK signaling in CtxR cells. Notably, EGFR directly regulated the expression of AXL mRNA through MAPK
signaling and the transcription factor c-Jun in CtxR cells, creating a positive feedback loop that maintained EGFR
activation by AXL. Cetuximab-sensitive parental cells were rendered resistant to cetuximab by stable overexpression of AXL or stimulation with EGFR ligands, the latter of which increased AXL activity and association
with the EGFR. In tumor xenograft models, the development of resistance following prolonged treatment with
cetuximab was associated with AXL hyperactivation and EGFR association. Furthermore, in an examination of
patient-derived xenografts established from surgically resected HNSCCs, AXL was overexpressed and activated in
tumors that displayed intrinsic resistance to cetuximab. Collectively, our results identify AXL as a key mediator of
cetuximab resistance, providing a rationale for clinical evaluation of AXL-targeting drugs to treat cetuximabresistant cancers. Cancer Res; 74(18); 5152–64. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) is
composed of three family members: Tyro-3 (Sky), AXL (Ark
or Ufo), and MerTK. Cognate ligand binding to TAM receptors
on the cell surface leads to receptor dimerization, kinase
domain activation, and auto/trans-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located on each receptor's cytoplasmic tail (1).
The activation of TAM receptors stimulate PI3K/AKT and
Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk (MAPK) signaling cascades, leading to
increased cell survival, proliferation, migration, invasion, and
angiogenesis (1–4).
TAM family overexpression and activation have been
observed in many human cancers (1–11). Recently, the AXL
receptor has been implicated in cancer cell resistance to

anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; refs. 12–17) and
other chemotherapeutics (10, 15, 18). Collectively, these data
indicate that AXL functions as a potent oncogene that can
modulate resistance to conventional and targeted cancer
therapies.
Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that has
shown efﬁcacy in treating head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC), metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC),
and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; refs. 19–26). Unfortunately, clinical studies indicate that most patients who
initially respond to cetuximab eventually acquire resistance
(27–29). To understand the mechanisms of acquired resistance, we previously created a model in which the cetuximab-sensitive (CtxS) NSCLC cell line NCI-H226 was treated
with increasing doses of cetuximab for a period of six
months until resistant single cell clones emerged (30).
Analysis of cetuximab-resistant (CtxR) clones demonstrated
that the expression of EGFR and its activation was dramatically increased because of dysregulated EGFR internalization and degradation without mutation of the receptor (30).
Overall, CtxR cells remained highly addicted to the EGFR
signaling network (30–32).
On the basis of these previous ﬁndings, we investigated
whether the AXL receptor played a role in cetuximab resistance. Examination of in vitro NSCLC and HNSCC models of
acquired resistance indicated that AXL was highly overexpressed and activated in CtxR cells. Further analysis indicated
that CtxR cells had increased dependency on AXL for cellular
proliferation, EGFR activation, and MAPK signaling. AXL activity

AXL and Resistance to Cetuximab

was also examined in tumors harvested from de novo–acquired
CtxR NCI-H226 xenografts, where AXL was highly activated and
associated with the EGFR. Finally, AXL was overexpressed and
hyperactivated in HNSCC patient-derived xenografts (PDX)
that were intrinsically resistant to cetuximab therapy. Collectively, this work indicates that AXL plays a role in cetuximab
resistance and provides rationale for the clinical evaluation of
anti-AXL therapeutics for the treatment of cetuximab resistant
cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and development of acquired resistance
The human NSCLC cell line NCI-H226 was purchased from
ATCC and maintained in 10% FBS in RPMI-1640 (Mediatech
Inc.) with 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The HNSCC cell line
UM-SCC1 was provided by Dr. Thomas E. Carey (University of
Michigan, Ann Harbor, MI) and maintained in 10% FBS in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 1% penicillin

Immunoblot analysis
Whole-cell lysis was performed as previously described
(31, 33). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
was used to visualize proteins. For detection of phosphorylated
AXL, cells were treated with pervanadate (0.12 mmol/L Na3VO4
in 0.002% H2O2) for 2 minutes before cell lysis, a method
previously described (10). EGF and TGFa ligands were added
to growth media 45 minutes before lysis.
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were processed for immunoprecipitation as previously
described (34). Five-hundred micrograms of protein, 2 mg of
anti-AXL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cetuximab, or IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used.
Cell proliferation assay
Crystal violet assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies) were performed as previously described
(31, 35). Cellular proliferation was measured 72 hours after
siRNA or drug treatment.
Flow cytometric analysis
Cells were processed as previously described (36) and analyzed using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Propidium iodide was added to each sample at a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mg/mL. Histogram analysis was performed
using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.).
Plasmids, transfection, and stable cell line construction
pDONR223-AXL (Plasmid 23945) was purchased from
Addgene and subcloned into the BamH1/EcoR1 restriction
sites of the pcDNA6.0 expression vector (Life Technologies).
Stable transfection was performed using Lipofectamine LTX
and Opti-MEM I (Life Technology) commencing 48 hours after
transfection via 6 mg/mL blasticidin to the growth media.
Single-cell clones were chosen for expansion and validation
for AXL expression.
cDNA synthesis and qPCR
Total RNA and cDNA synthesis were prepared as previously
described (34). All reactions were performed in triplicate.
To determine the normalized value, 2DDCt values were compared between AXL and 18S, where the change in crossing threshold (DCt) ¼ Ct AXL  Ct 18S and DDCt ¼ DCt(HC1, HC4, or HC8) 
DCt(HP) or DDCt ¼ DCt(NT) DCt(siAXL).
Cetuximab-resistant cell line xenografts and PDXs
CtxR cell line xenografts were established as previously
described (31), and HNSCC PDXs were established and evaluated for cetuximab response as described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
Student t tests were used to evaluate differences in proliferation, AXL mRNA expression, and pAXL-Y779 expression
levels by IHC. Differences were considered statistically significant if  , P < 0.05.

Results

performed 72 hours after transfection with a pooled siAXL or
siNT (Fig. 2A). Loss of AXL expression resulted in statistically
signiﬁcant inhibition of proliferation (25%–35%) in all three
CtxR clones. As compared with parental HP cells, the CtxR
clones demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater decreases in proliferation after AXL knockdown (P < 0.01). Analysis of CtxR clones
after AXL knockdown demonstrated that EGFR activation was
severely diminished at both tyrosine 1068 and 1173, autophosphorylation sites responsible for recruiting Grb2 and Shc (Fig.
2B; ref. 37). In addition, the activation of c-Raf, p44/42 MAPK,
AKT, and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were diminished in all
CtxR clones upon AXL knockdown, whereas the activation of
these molecules were relatively unchanged or slightly increased
in HP cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, ablation of HER2 or HER3
receptors, previously shown to be hyperactivated in CtxR cells
(30), did not affect the phosphorylation of EGFR at either
tyrosine site (Fig. 2B, inset). Collectively, these data demonstrate
that CtxR clones are dependent on AXL for cellular proliferation
via EGFR activation and downstream signaling.
To determine whether AXL and EGFR were physically associated in CtxR clones, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were
performed and indicated that AXL was associated with EGFR in
all CtxR clones but not parental cells (Fig. 2C). EGFR and AXL
cooperation was further analyzed by reciprocally knocking
down EGFR expression with siRNA (Fig. 2D). EGFR knockdown

AXL is overexpressed and activated in a model of
acquired resistance to cetuximab
The NSCLC CtxR clones HC1, HC4, and HC8 have been
previously shown to be resistant to increasing doses of cetuximab as compared to the CtxS NCI-H226 parental cell line HP
(30, 31). Analysis of CtxR clones HC1, HC4, and HC8 demonstrated that all clones expressed increased AXL mRNA and
protein as compared to HP cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, AXL
exhibited increased phosphorylation on tyrosine 702 and 779 in
all CtxR clones. In addition, MAPK and AKT pathways were
hyperactivated and there was increased expression and phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun in CtxR clones.
Moreover, plasma membrane levels of AXL were detected via
ﬂow cytometry, where CtxR cells had approximately 50% to
80% more surface AXL expression as compared to HP cells
(Fig. 1B). Collectively, these data demonstrate that AXL is
overexpressed and activated in established clones with
acquired resistance to cetuximab.

led to a loss of total AXL protein and mRNA expression in CtxR
clones and parental HP cells, as well as diminished activation of
c-Raf, p44/42 MAPK, AKT, rpS6, and c-Jun. To examine whether
EGFR regulation of AXL was contingent on MAPK or AKT
signaling directly, we alternatively knocked down p44/42 MAPK
or AKT1 with siRNA (Fig. 2E). This experiment indicated that
knockdown of p44/42 MAPK led to a loss of AXL mRNA and

protein expression, whereas AKT1 did not regulate AXL expression. These results suggest that EGFR regulates AXL expression
speciﬁcally through MAPK signaling.
Previous studies indicated that the AXL promoter contains
binding motifs for AP-1 family transcription factors, in which
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation of leukemia cells
led to increased AXL expression through MAPK signaling to

the transcription factor c-Jun (38). Because CtxR clones were
found to overexpress c-Jun (Fig. 1A), we hypothesized that
c-Jun may function downstream of MAPK to regulate AXL
mRNA expression. To investigate this, c-Jun was knocked
down with siRNA (Fig. 2F), leading to an approximate 35% to
55% decrease in AXL mRNA levels. Moreover, there was a loss
of AXL protein expression, which appeared similar to the levels
detected after EGFR or MAPK knockdown (Fig. 2D and E).
Importantly, this led to a loss of EGFR activation in CtxR
clones, but not in parental HP cells, indicating that AXL is
required for EGFR activation and subsequent signaling in the
resistant setting. Collectively, these data indicate that AXL
expression and subsequent EGFR activation are regulated
through the MAPK/c-Jun signaling pathway in CtxR clones.

to anti-AXL therapeutics. First, we tested the ability for the
anti-AXL monoclonal antibody MAb173 to inhibit CtxR cell
proliferation (Fig. 3A). CtxR clones were signiﬁcantly growth
inhibited upon treatment with increasing doses of MAb173,
whereas CtxS HP cells were less sensitive. In addition, the
growth-inhibitory effects of CtxR clones were statistically
decreased from the effect on HP cells when treated with
50 and 100 mg/mL of MAb173 (P < 0.01). Consistent with
previous studies (9), MAb173 induced AXL degradation (Fig.
3B). Interestingly, total EGFR protein levels were reduced upon
MAb173 treatment of CtxR clones, in addition to loss of MAPK
signaling. MAb173 did not affect the activation of EGFR or
MAPK signaling in HP cells.
Next, the small-molecule TKI R428, which has greater than
100-fold selectivity for AXL as compared with EGFR or Tyro
and 50-fold greater afﬁnity than Mer (39), was tested for
therapeutic beneﬁt in CtxR clones (Fig. 4A). All CtxR clones
demonstrated robust antiproliferative effects upon treatment
with 0.8 and 1 mmol/L of R428, whereas HP cells were less

from the effect on HP cells when treated with 0.8 and 1 mmol/L
of R428 (P < 0.01). Analysis of CtxR clones after treatment, via
pan-tyrosine, demonstrated that AXL phosphorylation was
inhibited with 1.0 mmol/L of R428, the same dose that elicited
antiproliferative responses (Fig. 4B). In addition, R428 treatment led to a loss of EGFR phosphorylation on tyrosine 1068
and MAPK signaling, whereas these targets were relatively
unaffected in HP cells (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, both MAb173 and

AXL and Resistance to Cetuximab

2,000 mm3, they were harvested and processed for immunoblot
analysis (Fig. 5D) and IHC (Fig. 5E). To detect the levels of total
and activated AXL (Y779), immunoprecipitation analysis was
performed from tumor lysates. Strikingly, a double banding
pattern for total AXL was observed in all CtxR tumors, whereas
a single AXL band was observed in the IgG-treated tumors. The
upper band corresponds to a shift in AXL molecular weight due
to the presence of phosphorylated AXL, which was detected by
the phospho AXL-Y779 antibody (Fig. 5D, arrows). In addition,
AXL was associated with EGFR only in the CtxR tumors by
immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5D). Analysis of whole-cell lysate
indicated that EGFR was also highly activated (indicated by
tyrosine 1068 phosphorylation) in the CtxR tumors that
expressed the highest levels of pAXL-Y779. IHC analysis of IgG
versus CtxR tumors revealed that CtxR tumors had statistically
signiﬁcant increases in pAXL-Y779 staining (Fig. 5E). Collectively, these data demonstrate that AXL overexpression and/or
activation plays a role in acquired resistance to cetuximab
in vitro and in vivo.
To expand these ﬁndings to a more clinically relevant model
system, we determined whether there was a correlation
between cetuximab response and AXL expression in PDXs
established directly from surgically resected HNSCCs. Six
PDXs were established from patients who had not received
prior cetuximab therapy (see Supplementary Table S1 for
clinical characteristics of patients before surgery). For each
PDX, dual ﬂank tumors were established in 16 athymic nude
mice. When tumors reached approximately 200 mm3, the mice
were stratiﬁed into two treatment groups: control (vehicletreated) and cetuximab (n ¼ 8 mice/16 tumors per group).
After completing the treatment regimen, tumor growth was
monitored to evaluate response to therapy. Overall, there were
three cetuximab-sensitive PDXs (UW-SCC36, UW-SCC22, and
UW-SCC52) and three cetuximab-resistant PDXs (UW-SCC1,
UW-SCC17, and UW-SCC25; Fig. 6).
PDXs harvested from early-passaged tumors before treatment were evaluated for AXL expression and activation by IHC
analysis (Fig. 6). The cetuximab-sensitive PDXs had low levels
of AXL and pAXL-Y779 staining, with UW-SCC36 having nearly
absent expression of both markers. In comparison, the three
cetuximab-resistant PDXs expressed 1.8- to 2.5-fold increases
in pAXL-Y779 expression, and 2.5- to 4.3-fold increases in total
AXL expression as compared with the staining intensity

increased phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream MAPK
signaling. Cetuximab dose–response proliferation assays demonstrated that HP-AXL cells were statistically more resistant
to cetuximab as compared with HP-Vector cells (P < 0.01;
Fig. 5B). HC4 cells served as a cetuximab-resistant control in
these experiments. These data demonstrate that the stable
overexpression of AXL can confer resistance to cetuximab in a
CtxS cell line, supporting a putative role for AXL in the
development of cetuximab resistance.
We previously reported that CtxR clones overexpressed
EGFR ligands (36); however, whether EGFR ligands inﬂuenced
cetuximab resistance through regulating AXL activity and/or
association with the EGFR was not investigated. Therefore, HP
cells were stimulated with two EGFR ligands, EGF or TGFa,
and subsequently measured for AXL activation, association
with the EGFR, and cetuximab response (Fig. 5C). Analysis of
HP cells after ligand stimulation indicated that both ligands led
to increased AXL activation and association with the EGFR
(detected by immunoprecipitation analysis). In addition, incubation with either ligand resulted in increased resistance to
cetuximab. Interestingly, the ligand for AXL, Gas6, was not
overexpressed in CtxR clones and did not drive resistance in HP
cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that
EGFR ligands may inﬂuence cetuximab resistance through
stimulating AXL activation and association with the EGFR.
To further analyze the role of AXL in cetuximab resistance,
we developed de novo tumors with acquired resistance to
cetuximab in vivo (31, 32). To develop de novo–acquired
resistance, the CtxS cell line NCI-H226 was inoculated unilaterally into the dorsal ﬂank of 11 athymic nude mice (Fig. 5D).
Once tumors reached approximately 100 mm3, 4 mice were
treated with IgG control antibody (1 mg/mouse) and 7 mice
were treated with cetuximab (1 mg/mouse) by intraperitoneal
injection twice weekly. Tumors treated with IgG grew rapidly
(tumors denoted as IgG-1 to IgG-4 in Fig. 5D), whereas all
cetuximab-treated tumors displayed initial growth control.
Acquired resistance was observed after approximately 30 days
of cetuximab exposure in 6 of the cetuximab-treated mice
(tumors denoted as CtxR-1 to CtxR-5, and CtxR-7), at which
point there was marked tumor growth in the presence of
continued cetuximab therapy (Fig. 5D). One mouse was continued on cetuximab for 90 days until a signiﬁcant increase in
tumor growth was observed (CtxR-6). Once tumors reached

detected in UW-SCC36 tumors. Collectively, these data demonstrate that AXL is overexpressed and activated in PDXs that
are intrinsically resistant to cetuximab therapy.
AXL plays a role in acquired resistance to cetuximab in
HNSCC
To further investigate whether AXL plays a more global
role in acquired resistance to cetuximab, we developed a
model of acquired resistance to cetuximab using the CtxS
parental cell line UM-SCC1 (30). This resulted in a parental
SCC1 cell line (SP) and three cetuximab-resistant clones
(SP7, SP8, and SP11). SP cell growth was inhibited upon
treatment with increasing doses of cetuximab, while the
three HNSCC CtxR clones remained resistant (Fig. 7A).
Analysis of HNSCC CtxR clones indicated that all clones
had increased steady-state expression of AXL as compared
with SP (Fig. 7B). In addition, each clone demonstrated
increased activation of c-Raf, p44/42 MAPK, AKT, rpS6,
and c-Jun (Fig. 7B). To determine whether AXL inﬂuenced
HNSCC CtxR cell proliferation, cells were transfected with
siAXL or NT siRNA and proliferation assays were performed.
Loss of AXL expression resulted in a signiﬁcant inhibition in
cellular proliferation (20%–25%) in HNSCC CtxR clones,
while parental SP cells were nonresponsive (Fig. 7C). The
growth-inhibitory effects of siAXL in HNSCC CtxR clones
were statistically decreased compared with the effect on SP
cells (P < 0.01). Furthermore, all HNSCC CtxR clones
expressed diminished activation of EGFR (by tyrosine
1068 phosphorylation) as well as MAPK and AKT signaling
pathways upon AXL knockdown, whereas the activation of
these molecules was relatively unchanged or slightly
increased in SP cells. Collectively, these data suggest that
AXL plays a role in acquired resistance to cetuximab in
HNSCC.

Discussion
Cetuximab is a commonly used anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that has demonstrated efﬁcacy in treating in HNSCC,
mCRC, and NSCLC (19–26). Although cetuximab treatment has
yielded clinical beneﬁt, both intrinsic and acquired resistance
are common outcomes. Recently, a novel mutation was identiﬁed in the EGFR (S492R) that mediates resistance to cetuximab (40); however, resistance also occurs in the WT setting.
Multiple mechanisms of cetuximab resistance exist, including
upregulation of EGFR ligands (41), nuclear translocation of
EGFR (36), oncogenic shift to vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1; ref. 42), and constitutive activation of downstream signaling molecules such as KRAS (43) and
c-Src (44). This study is the ﬁrst to describe a role for AXL in
mediating cetuximab resistance in the setting of wild type
(WT) EGFR, and thus provides rationale for the development
and use of anti-AXL therapeutics for treatment of CtxR tumors.
Cetuximab resistance is challenging to study due to the lack
of access to patient tissue upon relapse. To model CtxR
mechanisms that may occur in humans, several models of
acquired resistance were established via prolonged exposure of
CtxS cells to cetuximab (30–32). These models indicated that
CtxR clones and tumors had increased expression and dependency on the EGFR (30–32). In this study, AXL was found to
activate EGFR in CtxR clones, whereas HER2 and HER3 receptors did not, suggesting that AXL is a key mediator of EGFR
activity in the resistant setting. Furthermore, EGFR and AXL
were associated in CtxR clones and tumors (Figs. 2C and 5D), a
ﬁnding previously reported in triple-negative breast cancers
(TNBC; ref. 14), tumors that are intrinsically resistant to
cetuximab. Interestingly, EGF mediated AXL-induced signaling pathways in TNBC, whereas Gas6 did not (14), similar to
our ﬁndings in Fig. 5C. Another novel ﬁnding was that EGFR
signaling led to increased AXL mRNA expression in CtxR

Figure 7. AXL mediates acquired resistance to cetuximab in HNSCC. A, Ctx cell clones (SP7, SP8, and SP11) and the Ctx parental cell line (SP) were treated
with increasing doses of cetuximab (1, 10, and 100 nmol/L) for 72 hours before performing proliferation assays. Proliferation is plotted as a percentage
of growth relative to vehicle-treated cells (n ¼ 5 for three independent experiments). B, whole-cell lysate was harvested from cells followed by immunoblotting

clones. The regulation of AXL mRNA was contingent on MAPK
and c-Jun because knockdown of either decreased AXL expression (Fig. 2E and F).
These data support a positive-feedback loop that occurs in
EGFR-dependent CtxR cells (Fig. 8). In this model, resistance is
characterized by increased EGFR ligand production, dimerization, and transactivation of AXL and EGFR. This interaction
results in hyperactivated MAPK/c-Jun signaling, upregulation
of AXL mRNA expression, and maintenance of constitutive
EGFR activation and cetuximab resistance. The de novo CtxR
cell line xenografts support this model, as CtxR tumors
expressed increased total and activated AXL (especially as
compared with IgG-1 and IgG-2). Although c-Jun was capable

www.aacrjournals.org

of regulating AXL mRNA expression in CtxS parental cells, this
regulation did not reduce EGFR activity (Fig. 2F), suggesting
that EGFR and AXL are not coupled in CtxS cells.
Because of limited availability of patient tissue after cetuximab failure, the expression status of AXL and pAXL-Y779 was
evaluated in intrinsically resistant HNSCC PDXs. PDXs are
clinically relevant cancer models because they accurately
maintain many aspects of the parental tumor, including its
histology, gene expression proﬁle, copy number variance, and
metastatic patterns (45, 46). In this study, total and activated
AXL were highly overexpressed in HNSCC PDXs that were
resistant to cetuximab (Fig. 6). The strong correlation between
AXL and cetuximab resistance observed in the PDXs supports

the mechanistic work performed in this study and suggests
that AXL may mediate both intrinsic and acquired resistance
to cetuximab.
To date, AXL has been identiﬁed to play a role in resistance
to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC (16), HNSCC (13), and TNBC (14). In
NSCLC, AXL was overexpressed and activated in EGFR-mutant
erlotinib-resistant cells, where AXL inhibition resensitized
tumor cells to erlotinib (13, 16). In this study, AXL inhibition
was sufﬁcient to inhibit the growth of CtxR clones, but did
not resensitize CtxR clones to cetuximab (data not shown).
This likely occurred because AXL inhibition robustly decreased
EGFR activation; thus, adding cetuximab provided no further
beneﬁt. Although AXL inhibition led to robust antiproliferative
effects in CtxR clones, cell growth was not completely arrested,
suggesting that other RTKs may inﬂuence resistance. Previous
work from our laboratory and others suggests that signaling
emanating from HER2:HER3 heterodimers play a role in
resistance to anti-EGFR agents (30, 47). Thus, targeting AXL

5162

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

and either HER2 or HER3 may result in even more robust
antiproliferative responses because EGFR signaling could be
abrogated through AXL inhibition and HER2:HER3 signaling
could be blocked with anti-HER2 or HER3 agents. Ultimately,
this approach may lead to a complete loss of HER family
signaling capabilities and serve as a powerful strategy for the
treatment of CtxR cancers.
With increasing evidence supporting the role of AXL in
resistance to anti-EGFR agents, the development of anti-AXL
therapeutics is essential. In this study, two novel anti-AXL
therapeutics were tested: MAb173, an anti-AXL–neutralizing
monoclonal antibody, and R428, a selective small-molecule
AXL TKI. In previous studies, researchers demonstrated that
AXL was hyperactivated in Kaposi sarcoma and that MAb173
induced AXL endocytosis and degradation (9). In addition to
AXL, total EGFR expression was decreased upon MAb173
treatment of CtxR cells (Fig. 3B), supporting the existence of
AXL and EGFR heterodimers and the utility of this antibody in
the setting of cetuximab resistance. Furthermore, EGFR was
not degraded in MAb173-treated HP cells, which lack AXL and
EGFR association (Fig. 2C). The anti-AXL TKI R428 has also
shown antitumorigenic effects in multiple cancer models,
including breast cancer (14, 39) and HNSCC (13). The differences in growth inhibition observed between MAb173 and
R428 may result from off-target effects of R428, leading to more
robust antiproliferative responses. R428 has now entered
phase I clinical trials, whereas MAb173 is still undergoing
preclinical testing.
Overall, AXL plays a key role in tumor growth, metastasis,
angiogenesis, and resistance to anti-EGFR agents (12–17). In
addition, AXL inhibition has been shown to enhance the
efﬁcacy of standard chemotherapy regimens (10, 15, 18). With
AXL at the forefront, Tyro and Mer receptors also inﬂuence
parameters of tumor biology (1, 4). In fact, both Tyro and Mer
receptors were differentially overexpressed in the current CtxR
models (unpublished data), promoting further research on the
global role of TAM receptors in cetuximab resistance. Collectively, the studies herein have strong potential for translation
into future clinical trials and therapies for patients with
cetuximab-resistant tumors.
