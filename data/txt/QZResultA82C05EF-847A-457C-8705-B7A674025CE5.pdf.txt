Abstract
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

FOXM1 is implicated in genotoxic drug resistance but its mechanism of action remains elusive.
We show here that FOXM1-depletion can sensitize breast cancer cells and MEFs into entering
epirubicin-induced senescence, with the loss of long-term cell proliferation ability, the
accumulation of γH2AX foci, and the induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity
and cell morphology. Conversely, reconstitution of FOXM1 in FOXM1-deficient MEFs alleviates
the accumulation of senescence-associated γH2AX foci. We also demonstrate that FOXM1
regulates NBS1 at the transcriptional level through an FHRE on its promoter. Like FOXM1,
NBS1 is overexpressed in the epirubicin-resistant MCF-7EpiR cells and its expression level is low
but inducible by epirubicin in MCF-7 cells. Consistently, overexpression of FOXM1 augmented
and FOXM1 depletion reduced NBS1 expression and epirubicin-induced ATM phosphorylation in
breast cancer cells. Together these findings suggest that FOXM1 increases NBS1 expression and
ATM phosphorylation, possibly through increasing the levels of the MRN(MRE11/RAD50/
NBS1) complex. Consistent with this idea, the loss of P-ATM induction by epirubicin in the
NBS1-deficient NBS1-LBI fibroblasts can be rescued by NBS1 reconstitution. Resembling
FOXM1, NBS1 depletion also rendered MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells more sensitive to
epirubicin-induced cellular senescence. In agreement, the DNA repair-defective and senescence
phenotypes in FOXM1-deficent cells can be effectively rescued by overexpression of NBS1.

Moreover, overexpression of NBS1 and FOXM1 similarly enhanced and their depletion
downregulated HR DNA repair activity. Crucially, overexpression of FOXM1 failed to augment
HR activity in the background of NBS1 depletion, demonstrating that NBS1 is indispensable for
the HR function of FOXM1. The physiological relevance of the regulation of NBS1 expression by
FOXM1 is further underscored by the strong and significant correlation between nuclear FOXM1
and total NBS1 expression in breast cancer patient samples, further suggesting that NBS1 as a key
FOXM1 target gene involved in DNA damage response, genotoxic drug resistance and DNA
damage-induced senescence.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy amongst women worldwide, as well as one of
the leading causes of cancer death. Genotoxic drugs, including anti-metabolites,
topoisomerase inhibitors, and anthracyclines as well as radiotherapy are used universally in
the treatment of breast cancer and to reduce the chance of metastasis. These therapeutic
agents are particularly important for the treatment of breast cancers that are not suitable for
or refractory to endocrine therapies. Anthracyclines, including epirubicin, are anti-cancer
antibiotics that have proven efficacy in the treatment of breast, lung and ovarian cancers as
well as leukaemia (1). The primary mechanism of action of anthracyclines is to interfere
with enzymes involved in DNA replication, but these drugs can also induce DNA
intercalation and damage, which will ultimately result in DNA lesions primarily in the forms
of double-stranded breaks (DSBs). The cellular response to DNA damage, the so-called
‘DNA damage response’, involves the recognition of DNA damage, the activation of cell
cycle checkpoints, transcription programmes, DNA damage repair, and senescence and
apoptosis, if the damage is irreparable (2).
DSBs are predominantly repaired by two mechanisms, homologous recombination (HR) and
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (3). Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) central to the DNA damage response
signalling and is activated upon DNA damage by DSBs. Its activation, accompanied by
autophosphorylation on serine 1981 (P-ATM), induces phosphorylation of its downstream
target histone H2AX, leading ultimately to the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to the
sites of damage (4). In addition, the ATM kinase also directly phosphorylates modulator
proteins, including p53BP1, SMC1, BRCA1, NBS1 and CHK2, essential for triggering cellcycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair (5-8). The MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex,
has a key role in sensing DSBs and in the activation of ATM (7). The assembly of the MRN
complex is a rate-limiting step for the recruitment of the ATM and its phosphorylation, and
therefore, the activation of the DNA damage repair response (9). In particular, ATM is
dependent on NBS1 as part of the MRN complex for sensing DSBs, and also as an adaptor
molecule for phosphorylation of its downstream substrates (10, 11).

Cellular senescence is an intrinsic cellular response that restricts unlimited cell proliferation
and has a key physiological role in tumour suppression through preventing cancer initiation
and progression (12). Cells can be induced to undergo premature senescence by intracellular
as well as extracellular stress including irradiation, persistent DNA damage response,
oncogene activation, telomere erosion, oxidative stress, toxins and stem cell reprogramming
(13). FOXM1 is a member of the Forkhead box (FOX) superfamily of transcription factors
that share a conserved winged-helix DNA-binding domain (14). It is ubiquitously expressed
in actively proliferating tissues and plays a crucial role in a wide range of biological
processes, including cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, metastasis, apoptosis, tissue
regeneration and drug resistance. We have obtained evidence that FOXM1 can protect cells
from genotoxic agent-induced senescence by enhancing HR DNA repair. Consistently,
FOXM1 is overexpressed in genotoxic agent resistant cancer cells. In here, we studied the
role of FOXM1 in genotoxic drug resistance and found that FOXM1 regulates NBS1
expression to modulate HR DNA damage repair, which has a role in overcoming DNA
damage agent-induced cellular senescence.

FOXM1 deletion decreases long-term viability and activates cellular senescence in
response to DNA damage

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Recent evidence shows that FOXM1 can protect cells from genotoxic agent-induced cell
death by enhancing DNA damage repair (15-17). However, the role of FOXM1 in
promoting long-term cell viability in response to genotoxic treatment has not been
evaluated. To address this, we treated wild-type (WT) and Foxm1–/– MEFs with a range of
concentrations of epirubicin and studied their long-term viability by clonogenic assays
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The results showed that at 0, 20 and 40 nM epirubicin, the colony
formation capacity of Foxm1–/– MEFs was significantly impaired compared with WT MEFs
(Fig. 1A). To confirm this further, WT and Foxm1–/– MEFs were also exposed to moderate
levels of ionising-radiation (Fig. 1B). At 5 Gy γ-irradiation, the colony formation capacity of
Foxm1–/– MEFs was significantly reduced compared to WT MEFs. As these low epirubicin
concentrations and ionizing irradiation doses do not induce considerable cell death (15), we
reasoned that epirubicin might induce long-term proliferative arrest, implicative of cellular
senescence. To test this conjecture, WT and Foxm1–/– MEFs were assayed for senescenceassociated β-galactosidase (SAβ-gal) activity following low doses of epirubicin treatment
(Fig. 1C). At 20 and 40 nM epirubicin treatment, significantly higher numbers of Foxm1–/–
MEFs displayed distinct SAβ-gal activity and ‘flat cell’ morphology compared with WT
MEFs, suggesting that FOXM1 has a key role in DNA damage-induced senescence.
Moreover, significantly higher numbers of Foxm1–/– MEFs displayed SAβ-gal and senescent
morphology compared with WT MEFs following exposure to 5 Gy of γ-irradiation (Fig.
1D). Senescent cells accumulate γH2AX foci as markers for unrepaired or irreparable
damaged DNA (18). We also found that Foxm1–/– MEFs accumulated significantly higher
numbers of γH2AX foci compared to WT MEFs at prolonged times of 24, 48 and 72 h
following epirubicin treatment, suggesting that FOXM1 deletion renders MEFs more
susceptible to the accumulation of DSBs induced by genotoxic agents (Supplementary Fig.
S2).

FOXM1 depletion resensitizes MCF-7 breast cancer cells to epirubicin-induced cellular
senescence

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We next studied the effects of FOXM1 depletion by siRNA on the long-term viability of
MCF-7 and the epirubicin-resistant MCF-7EpiR breast cancer cell lines by clonogenic
assays (Fig. 2). FOXM1-knockdown sensitized MCF-7 cells to long-term proliferative arrest
at relatively low epirubicin concentrations (eg. 10 and 20 nM) (Fig. 2A), whereas at higher
concentrations (>20 nM) the colony formation ability was completely lost in MCF-7 cells
(data not shown). FOXM1-depletion alone almost completely abolished the colony
formation ability of MCF-7EpiR cells irrespective of the dosage of epirubicin used,
suggesting that MCF-7EpiR cells are dependent on high FOXM1 expression for long-term
survival (Fig. 2B). In addition, similar to what it occur in MEFs, FOXM1 knockdown in
MCF-7 cells enhanced the number of cells exhibiting SAβ-gal activity and morphology at 0
and 10 nM epirubicin (Fig. 2C). Consistent with previous results, FOXM1 knockdown in
MCF-7EpiR cells resulted in almost all cells displaying senescence-associated SAβ-gal
activity and morphology independent of epirubicin levels, suggesting MCF-7EpiR cells have
become dependent on FOXM1 to override senescence (Fig. 2D). Senescent cells accumulate
γH2AX foci as markers for unrepaired or irreparable damaged DNA (18). To confirm this
further, we studied the effects of FOXM1 depletion on nuclear γH2AX foci formation in
MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells following γ-irradiation (Fig. 3A and 3B). Quantification of
γH2AX foci showed that γ-irradiation induced the accumulation of significantly more foci
over the extended time course of 24, 48 and 72 h in FOXM1-knockdown cells in
comparison to control siRNA-transfected MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells, further indicating
that FOXM1 has a critical role in overcoming DNA damage-induced senescence.
FOXM1 enhances NBS1 and P-ATM expression to promote DNA damage repair signalling

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We have shown previously that FOXM1 is essential for HR repair after DSBs (17). To
elucidate the underlying mechanistic role of FOXM1 in DNA damage-induced senescence
and epirubicin-resistance, we next compared the expression patterns of FOXM1 with those
of the early HR sensor proteins, including ATM and components of the MRN (MRE11/
RAD50/NBS1; NBS1 also known as Nibrin and NBN) complex in MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR
cells in response to epirubicin. Western blot analysis showed that the expression level of
FOXM1 protein was induced transiently before declining eventually following epirubicin
treatment in MCF-7 cells, whereas FOXM1 was expressed consistently at high levels in the
resistant MCF-7EpiR cells (Fig. 4A). ATM was expressed at higher levels in MCF-7EpiR
compared to the control MCF-7 cells. Autophosphorylated ATM (P-ATM), indicative of
ATM activity, was constitutively high in MCF-7EpiR cells, whereas the P-ATM signal was
low but inducible by epirubicin in MCF-7 cells. NBS1 as well as its active phosphorylated
form PNBS1 followed similar kinetics as FOXM1 upon epirubicin treatment in both MCF-7
and MCF-7EpiR cells (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting the regulation of NBS1
expression and activity by FOXM1. By contrast, the other MRN components, MRE11 and
RAD50, did not show substantial correlation with the expression patterns of FOXM1 upon
epirubicin treatment. Consistently, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that upon epirubicin
treatment the NBS1 and FOXM1 mRNA displayed similar kinetics in both MCF-7 and
MCF-7EpiR cells, further suggesting FOXM1 may transcriptionally regulate NBS1
expression (Fig. 4B). To test this idea, both MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells were transfected

with non-targeting control (NS) or FOXM1 siRNA pools for 24 h and were subjects to
Western blot and qRTPCR analyses after incubation with epirubicin or vehicle control for
another 24 h. Silencing the expression of FOXM1 caused a significant reduction in the
NBS1 protein and mRNA levels in both MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells, whereas only a
moderate decrease was observed for the RAD50 and MRE11 protein, but not at the mRNA
level, upon FOXM1 knockdown (Fig. 4C and 4D; Supplementary Fig. S4). This suggests
that in contrast to NBS1, RAD50 and MRE11 are not directly regulated by FOXM1, raising
the possibility that their protein expression levels might be stabilized through forming an
active MRN complex. Notably, the expression of P-ATM and P-CHK2 was induced in
MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells after epirubicin treatment. This is likely to reflect the
genotoxic stress response of the cells after epirubicin treatment following the serum
starvation conditions used for siRNA transfection. These stress conditions might also be
responsible for the high levels of cell death and global protein degradation observed in the
MCF-7 cells. It is also noteworthy that P-ATM levels were induced by epirubicin treatment,
but this induction was abolished upon FOXM1 depletion by siRNA, suggesting FOXM1 is
involved in the activation of ATM. Similar results were also observed for the TERT48
human fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, the NBS1 mRNA was also
downregulated after FOXM1 depletion in the breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and
ZR-75-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). To confirm further that FOXM1 modulates ATM
activity through controlling NBS1 expression, we examined the expression of these early
DNA damage sensor proteins in wild-type (WT) and Foxm1–/– MEFs following epirubicin
treatment (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S6). Consistent with results from the breast cancer
cell lines, NBS1 and P-NBS1 accumulated with similar kinetics as FOXM1 in WT MEFs
following epirubicin treatment, but were barely detectable in Foxm1–/– MEFs. By contrast,
RAD50 and MRE11 were expressed at only marginally lower levels in Foxm1–/– MEFs
compared to WT MEFs. The Western blot results also showed that although ATM expressed
at comparable levels in WT and Foxm1–/– MEFs, P-ATM was induced by epirubicin and
expressed at much higher levels in WT compared to Foxm1–/– MEFs. qRT-PCR analysis
also indicated that upon epirubicin treatment the NBS1 and FOXM1 mRNA displayed
similar kinetics in both WT and Foxm1–/– MEFs, further confirming FOXM1 regulates
NBS1 expression (Fig. 5B). Notably, the slight discrepancies between FOXM1 and NBS1
protein and RNA levels can be due to the fact that both FOXM1 and NBS1 expression as
well as activity are also regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms (17, 19, 20).
Nevertheless, together these findings led us to postulate that FOXM1 may target NBS1
expression at the transcriptional level to enhance DNA damage repair signalling and
genotoxic drug resistance.
FOXM1 modulates NBS1 expression and ATM phosphorylation
We next overexpressed FOXM1 in the MCF-7 cells and examined its effects on the NBS1
expression and ATM activity. The result showed that overexpression of FOXM1 caused an
induction of NBS1 levels and ATM phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6A;
Supplementary Fig. S7), further confirming that FOXM1 regulates NBS1 expression and
thus MRN complex formation to promote ATM activation and phosphorylation. It is notable
that despite FOXM1 overexpression, NBS1 levels decreased after 48h of epirubicin
treatment, probably because both FOXM1 and NBS1 are also regulated at postOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 07.

transcriptional levels in response to epirubicin (19). We next studied the effects of NBS1
depletion in the resistant MCF-7EpiR cells (Fig. 6B). Knockdown of NBS1 expression by
siRNA did not affect FOXM1, RAD50 and MRE11 expression but resulted in a
downregulation of P-ATM and P-NBS expression. We also showed that the NBS1 is
required for ATM activition in response to epirubicin by demonstrating that reconstituting
NBS1 expression can restore ATM activity and phosphorylation in response to epirubicin in
the NBS1 deficient NBS1-LBI cells (Supplementary Fig. S8).
FOXM1 regulates NBS1 expression through a FHRE in its promoter
We next investigated if the regulation of NBS1 by FOXM1 is at the promoter level. To this
end, MCF-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with the FOXM1 expression construct and
a luciferase reporter gene under the control of either a human NBS1 wild-type (WT) or a
mutant (mut) NBS1 (1.5kbp) promoter with a putative FHRE (forkhead response element)
(−78bp) mutated (Fig. 6C) (21). We observed the (WT) NBS1 promoter activity was
augmented by FOXM1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the mutant (mut) NBS1
promoter had lower basal promoter activity and was not inducible by FOXM1 (Fig. 6C).
Collectively, these results suggest that FOXM1 is able to transactivate NBS1 gene through
the FHRE located at position −78bp, providing evidence that NBS1 is a direct target gene of
FOXM1. To confirm further that FOXM1 binds to the FHRE of the endogenous NBS1
promoter in vivo, we studied the occupancy of the FHRE region of the NBS1 promoter by
FOXM1 using Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with and without FOXM1
transfection in the MCF-7 cells and before and after 16 h epirubicin treatment in the
MCF-7EpiR cells. The ChIP analysis showed that FOXM1 is recruited to the endogenous
FHRE in both the MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR and its binding to the FHRE increases in
response to epirubicin (Fig. 6D). Together, these findings indicate that NBS1 is a direct in
vivo transcriptional target of FOXM1.

Correlation between NBS1 and FOXM1 expression in breast cancer samples
After establishing that NBS1 is a direct transcriptional target of FOXM1 in breast cancer and
fibroblast cell lines, the correlation of FOXM1 and NBS1 expression were assessed by
immunohistochemistry in breast cancer samples from 116 patients (Fig. 7A) (22). FOXM1
and NBS1 staining was detected in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Statistical
analysis of the expression patterns revealed that there was a strong and significant
correlation between FOXM1 nuclear staining and total NBS1 staining (Pearson
coefficient=0.318, p=0.002), providing further physiological evidence that FOXM1
regulates NBS1 expression in breast cancer patient samples (Fig. 7A). ). In additions, there
was also a trend linking high NBS1 nuclear localization expression to poor survival
(p=0.164 for overall survival, log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier estimate analysis) which by
multivariate Cox regression analysis, when adjusted by patients’ T-stage and lymph-node
involvement was significantly correlated with poorer survival (RR=2.869, p=0.048).
(Supplementary Fig. S9). Further analysis of FOXM1 and NBS1 mRNA transcript
expression in another previously published cohort (2878 breast cancer patients) (23)
revealed that high FOXM1 and NBS1 mRNA expression levels are very significantly
associated with poor survival (p<0.0001 and p=0.0012, respectively for overall survival,
Kaplan-Meier analysis) (Supplementary Fig. S10). The significance of NBS1 in survival

analyses suggests direct involvement of NBS1 in regulating cell senescence and DNA

NBS1 depletion induces senescence associated-phenotypes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Given that FOXM1 is involved in DNA damage-induced senescence after long treatments
with low levels of genotoxic agents and also controls NBS1 expression, we next explore the
role of NBS1 in genotoxic drug-induced senescence, we next studied the effects of NBS1
depletion on the long-term viability of MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells by clonogenic assays
(Fig. 7B). Like FOXM1, NBS1-knockdown sensitized MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells to
long-term proliferative arrest following treatment with epirubicin (Fig. 7B). Consistently,
NBS1 knockdown in MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells also enhanced the number of cells
exhibiting SAβ-gal activity and morphology at 0 and 10 nM epirubicin (Fig. 7C). These
findings strongly suggest that NBS1 protects MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells from entering
senescence.
NBS1 and FOXM1 are required for homologous recombination repair

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We have shown previously that FOXM1 is essential for HR but not NHEJ DNA repair (17).
We next analysed the role of NBS1 and FOXM1 in DSB repair using HeLa cell lines
harbouring an integrated direct repeat green fluorescent protein (DR-GFP) reporter for
homologous recombination (HR) (24, 25). The I-SceI expression plasmid was cotransfected
into DR-GFP HeLa cells with the non-specific (NS), FOXM1, or NBS1 siRNA and the
percentage of GFP-positive cells assayed by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S11).
Knockdown of NBS1 or FOXM1 using siRNA significantly decreased the number of GFPpositive cells in comparison with non-specific (NS) control siRNA in the HR DR-GFP
reporter system (54.0% and 67.6%, respectively) (Fig. 8A). Conversely, overexpression of
NBS1 and FOXM1 significantly increased the DSB repair via HR by 82.9% and 87.3%,
respectively (Fig. 8A). These observations indicate that similar to FOXM1, NBS1
contributes to HR-directed DSB repair. To investigate the functional relationship between
NBS1 and FOXM1 in HR-directed DSB repair, we next examined the effects of NBS1
depletion in the background of FOXM1 overexpression using DR-GFP HeLa reporter
system. The results showed that the HR activity after NBS1 knockdown and FOXM1
overexpression (49.4%) was not significantly higher than NBS1 depletion alone, indicating
that the function of FOXM1 to direct HR repair is linked to NBS1.
Ectopic expression of NBS1 in Foxm1–/– MEFs abrogates the accumulation of γH2AX foci
Finally, to demonstrate that the downregulation of NBS1 expression in FOXM1-depleted
cells is responsible for the accumulation of senescence associated γH2AX foci upon
epirubicin treatment, we next determined whether overexpression of NBS1 in Foxm1–/–
MEFs is able to alleviate the accumulation of γH2AX foci particularly at the longer times of
24, 48 and 72 h (Fig. 8B). Strikingly, Foxm1–/– MEFs co-transfected with pmCherry (red)
and NBS1 displayed significantly fewer foci compared with the adjacent/neighbouring nontransfected cells at the longer time points. The overexpression of NBS1 had the same effects
as reconstituting Foxm1–/– MEFs with pmCherry-FOXM1 (Supplementary Fig. S12). In
contrast, Foxm1–/– MEFs transfected with the empty-pmCherry control have similar kinetics

for senescence-associated γH2AX foci accumulation as the non-transfected cells
(Supplementary Fig. S12). Taken together these findings further suggest that the role of
FOXM1 to repair DSB-DNA damage is related to its ability to control NBS1 expression.

Discussion

Senescence is an intrinsic cellular response that induces irreversible cell-cycle arrest.
Cellular senescence restricts unlimited cell proliferation and has a critical role in both ageing
as well as tumour suppression. It was first observed in cell culture, but has also been proved
to exist in vivo. It is generally perceived that most cancer as well as tissue culture cells have
overcome cellular senescence and achieved immortality (12). However, the present study
shows that breast cancer cell lines as well as immortalized MEFs can be induced into
entering cellular senescence by DNA damaging agents, including epirubicin and ionizing
irradiation. Notably, the doses of DNA damaging agents required for triggering senescent
phenotypes in these cells are substantially lower than that required to induce short-term
proliferative arrest and cell death (15, 17), but are in line with the physiological doses used
in the clinic (26), raising the possibility that cellular senescence may be the predominant
mechanism of action for the genotoxic anti-cancer agents.
FOXM1 has been implicated in genotoxic drug resistance but its role and mechanism of
action are still not yet fully understood. We show here that FOXM1 has a central role in
modulating DNA damage-induced senescence and thus genotoxic agent resistance.
Depletion of FOXM1 sensitized MCF-7 breast cancer cells as well as MEFs into entering
epirubicin-induced senescence, as revealed by the loss in long-term cell proliferation ability,
the time-dependent accumulation of γH2AX foci, and induction of senescence-associated βgalactosidase activity and cell morphology. Conversely, reconstitution of FOXM1 in
FOXM1-deficient MEFs alleviated the accumulation of senescence-associated γH2AX foci.

NBS1 is a component of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex, which has a central role in
processing damaged DNA for repair and in promoting ATM-dependent DNA damage
response signalling (27). In defining FOXM1 targets that have a role in genotoxic agentinduced senescence, we identified NBS1 as a key FOXM1 target involved in DNA damage
repair, genotoxic drug resistance and DNA damage-induced senescence. At the molecular
level, we found that FOXM1 regulates NBS1 at the protein and mRNA levels through an
FHRE on its promoter in response to epirubicin treatment. Consistently, overexpression of
FOXM1 augmented NBS1 expression and ATM phosphorylation, whereas FOXM1
depletion reduced NBS1 expression and ATM phosphorylation upon epirubicin treatment in
breast cancer cells. Like FOXM1, NBS1 was overexpressed in the drug-resistant
MCF-7EpiR cells and its expression level was low but inducible by epirubicin in MCF-7
cells. We also found that NBS1, but not MRE11 and RAD50, levels were modulated by
FOXM1 and in response to epirubicin, suggesting that NBS1 is limiting for the formation of
the MRN complex and that its level sets the threshold for DNA repair activity. Collectively,
these findings suggest that FOXM1 increases NBS1 expression and ATM phosphorylation,
possibly mediated by increasing the levels of the MRN complex. Consistent with this idea,
the loss of P-ATM induction upon epirubicin treatment in the NBS1-deficient NBS1-LBI
human fibroblasts can be rescued by NBS1 reconstitution.

Resembling FOXM1, NBS1 depletion also rendered MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells more
sensitive to epirubicin-induced cellular senescence. In agreement, the DNA repair defect and
epirubicin-induced senescence phenotypes in FOXM1-deficent cells could be effectively
rescued by overexpression of NBS1. Consistently, overexpression of NBS1 and FOXM1
similarly enhanced and their depletion downregulated HR repair. Importantly,
overexpression of FOXM1 failed to augment HR activity in the background of NBS1
depletion, demonstrating that NBS1 is indispensable for the HR function of FOXM1.
Consistent with our findings, a role in DNA damage-induced senescence-associated
inflammatory cytokine secretion has previously been suggested for NBS1 (28). The
physiological relevance of the regulation of NBS1 expression by FOXM1 is further
underscored by the strong and significant correlation between nuclear FOXM1 and total
NBS1 expression in breast cancer patient samples. Furthermore, both FOXM1 and NBS1
mRNA expression is significantly associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer,
supporting a physiological role of FOXM1 and its target NBS1 in genotoxic drug resistance.
In summary, we identify NBS1 as a key FOXM1 target gene involved in DNA damage
response, genotoxic drug resistance and DNA damage-induced senescence. Our data also
suggest that the FOXM1-NBS1 axis can be a reliable prognostic marker and a viable target
for therapeutic intervention for targeting cancer and for overcoming genotoxic agent
resistance in cancer.

Luciferase reporter assay

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cells were co-transfected with the human NBS1 promoter-luciferase reporter and
transfection control Renilla (pRL-TK; Promega, Southampton, UK) constructs using
FuGENE6 (Roche). For promoter analysis, 24 h after transfection, cells were then collected,
washed twice in PBS, and harvested for firefly/Renilla luciferase assays using the DualGlo™ Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
Luminescence was then read using the 9904 TOPCOUNT Perkin Elmer (Beaconsfield, UK)
plate reader.
γH2AX immunofluorescent staining and foci quantification
Cells grown on chamber culture slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) for 15 min followed by permeabilisation for 10 min with
0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocking with 5% goat serum for 30 min at RT. The slides
were incubated with primary antibody anti-γH2AX Ser139 (20E3) (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA, USA) overnight at 4°C. See also Supplementary Methods and Materials.
Senesecence associated β-galactosidase assay
Cells were seeded in six well plates at a density of approximately 20000 cells/well prior to
treatment with epirubicin or γ-irradiation for 48 h. After culture for a further 5 days, cells
were fixed and stained using a Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit #9860 purchased
from Cell Signalling Technology (Beverley, MA, USA). Plates were incubated overnight at
37°C in a dry incubator (no CO2). Cells were then detected for blue staining under a brightfield microscope. The percentage of SA-β-Gal positive cells was calculated by counting the
cells in 5 random fields.
Western blotting and antibodies

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Western blotting was performed on whole cell extracts by lysing cells in buffer as described
(34). Antibodies FOXM1 (C-20), β-Tubulin (H-235) and I-SceI were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibodies for P-ATM (Ser1981; MAB3806),
PH2AX (Ser139; JBW301) were obtained from Upstate (Millipore, Oxford, UK) The NBS1
(3002) and P-NBS1 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (New
England Biolabs Ltd. Hitchin, UK). Total ATM antibody was obtained from Calbiochem
(Millipore, Oxford, UK), and MRE11 and RAD50 were from Novus Biologicals
(Cambridge, UK). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase–linked
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugates as appropriate (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and
visualised using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Pollards Wood, UK).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT–PCR)
Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Complementary DNA generated by Superscript III reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT
primers (Invitrogen, USA) was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as
described (35). Transcript levels were quantified using the standard curve method. For PCRprimer sequences, see supplementary Materials and Methods.

Western blot analysis. (B) Ectopic expression of NBS1 in Foxm1–/– MEFs reduces the
accumulation of γH2AX foci. Foxm1–/– MEFs were either transfected with pmCherry
control plasmids or cotransfected with pmCherry and NBS1 plasmids (Red) and treated with
0.1 μM of epirubicin for 0, 4, 24, 48 and 72 h. The cells were then immunostained for
γH2AX foci (Green) and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) to determine DNA
double-strand breaks. γH2AX foci quantification is shown. Bars represent the average of
γH2AX foci per cell from three independent experiments ± SD. Statistical significance was
