BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), treatment with lenalidomide induces a unique,
previously uncharacterized, immune response called tumor flare reaction (TFR). The clinical significance of this reaction remains unknown. METHODS: Forty-five patients with CLL who were treated with lenalidomide in a phase 2 clinical trial were evaluated for the clinical features, intensity, and duration of TFR. Correlation was made with tumor
response and the immune cellular microenvironment. Steroids for the prophylaxis of TFR was not given to patients in
Group A (n ¼ 29) whereas patients in Group B (n ¼ 16) received low-dose prednisone as well as a slow dose escalation of lenalidomide for the prevention of TFR. RESULTS: Thirty (67%) patients experienced a TFR, with a grade 2 or
3 reaction (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]) observed in 33% of
patients (47% in Group A and 9% in Group B; P ¼ .05). The median time to onset of the TFR was 6 days, and was longer in the patients receiving prophylaxis (4 days vs 9 days, respectively; P ¼ .01). A complete response was observed
in 7 of 30 (23%) patients with TFR and 1 of 15 (7%) patients without TFR. The median progression-free survival was
19.9 months and 19.4 months, respectively, for patients with versus those without TFR (P ¼ .92). CONCLUSIONS: TFR
is a unique immune-mediated phenomenon noted with lenalidomide treatment only in patients with CLL that correlates with clinical response. It can be effectively managed with anti-inflammatory agents. Cancer 2011;117:2127–35.

Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug that has antitumor activity in multiple myeloma and myelodysplas-

tic syndromes.1,2 Although a full understanding of lenalidomide’s mechanism of action still needs to be defined, preclinical evaluations have reported on its ability to modulate the immunological microenvironment via activation of the T and
natural killer (NK) cells3 as well as by down-regulation of several critical prosurvival cytokines in the tumor microenvironment, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, and vascular endothelial growth factor.4 In addition, it may affect
antigen-presenting cell function and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Because of its effect on the tumor
microenvironment as well established antitumor activity in other B-cell cancers, we investigated its clinical efficacy in
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In a phase 2 clinical trial, we observed significant clinical responses to
treatment with lenalidomide alone (updated results: an overall response rate of 58% with an 18% complete response [CR]
rate) in patients with recurrent or refractory CLL.5 Although the majority of side effects noted during the conduct of the

clinical study6 were consistent with those reported previously for lenalidomide, tumor flare reaction (TFR) was a
unique observation6,7 that to our knowledge was not
reported in studies of lenalidomide in the treatment of
other disease entities.1,2,8 It is interesting to note that in
patients with CLL, this reaction was observed during
treatment with both thalidomide and lenalidomide.7,9,10
Clinically, TFR presents as an acute inflammatory
reaction that primarily involves tumor-bearing sites.
Although our initial study reported on this phenomenon
as a possible side effect, to our knowledge to date there has
been no account that completely characterized the clinical
features and the natural course of TFR. Because TFR is
associated with morbidity and, more importantly, mimics
disease progression, its correct diagnosis and management
are critical for its effective use in patients with CLL. More
importantly, the clinical significance of this immunological phenomenon and its correlation with the antitumor
effects of lenalidomide remain unknown. In this article,
we reported to our knowledge for the first time the clinical
features of lenalidomide-associated TFR, described its
effective management strategies, and demonstrated that
the occurrence of TFR is an important immunological
phenomenon that correlates with clinical response in
patients with CLL who are treated with lenalidomide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Trial Design
Forty-five patients with recurrent or refractory CLL were
enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial.6 The first 29 patients
enrolled received single-agent lenalidomide at a dose of 25
mg orally for 21 days of a 28-day schedule (Group A).
These individuals also received allopurinol (at a dose of
300 mg daily, 2 to 3 days before treatment and continued
for up to 14 days) for the prevention of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). In this study, TLS was observed in only 2
patients. We thereafter investigated a lower starting dose
of lenalidomide with subsequent intrapatient dose escalation. Subsequently, 16 patients who were enrolled initiated treatment with lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg/day
and escalated by 5 mg every 1 to 2 weeks to a maximum of
25 mg (Group B). Furthermore, the first 29 patients enrolled did not receive TFR prophylaxis (Group A). However, because of frequent TFR, the subsequent 16 patients
enrolled received low-dose oral prednisone (20 mg daily
for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days) as TFR prophylaxis from treatment on Days 1 to 10 of Cycle 1 (Group
B). TFR prophylaxis was not given in subsequent cycles.

2128

The severity of the TFR was graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0) (ie, grade 1, mild pain not interfering with
function; grade 2, moderate pain [pain or analgesics interfering with function, but not interfering with activities of
daily living (ADL)]; grade 3, severe pain [pain or analgesics interfering with function and ADL]; and grade 4, disabling pain). Treatment with lenalidomide can result in
the development of a rash, independent of TFR. Therefore, patients in whom the only presenting feature was a
rash without any other sign of TFR were excluded from
the TFR group but were included in the non-TFR patient
group.
Immune Effector Cell Profile
Peripheral blood was obtained at baseline for analysis of
the immune cell profile. Samples were analyzed immediately at the time of harvesting for NK and T-cell repertoire
using flow cytometry with the following antibody panels
(all provided by BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif): CD16/
CD56/CD45 panel (NK cells), CD3/CD4/CD45 panel
(CD4þ T lymphocytes), and CD3/CD8/CD45 panel
(CD8þ T lymphocytes). All antibodies were titered and
used at saturating concentrations.
Statistical Analysis
Comparisons between the 2 groups were performed with
the following statistical analysis:the Wilcoxon-MannWhitney U test was used for complete continuous data,
the log-rank test was used for censored time-to-event data,
and the chi-square test was used for discrete variables. If
the time-to-event curves crossed, the modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for censored data was applied.11 The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time-to-event
distributions. If the assumptions of the chi-square test
were violated, the Fisher exact test was applied. For correlative studies, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for bilevel comparison, a nonparametric analysis assessing
whether 2 independent samples of marker values come
from the same distribution. The tri-level comparisons
were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test, testing for equality of medians across 3 groups. Any P value <.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. All calculations
were performed with SAS statistical software (version 9.1;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Clinical Feature of TFR
The TFR often included a sudden onset (within hours of
the first dose) of painful and tender enlargement of

Group A received single-agent lenalidomide therapy (at a dose of 25 mg orally for 21 days of a 28-day schedule) with
no TFR prophylaxis.

Group B received slow dose escalation of lenalidomide (at a dose of 10 mg/day and escalated by 5 mg every 1 to 2
weeks to a maximum of 25 mg) and TFR prophylaxis with low-dose prednisone (at a dose of 20 mg daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days).

disease-involved lymph nodes, the spleen, and/or liver,
which was often accompanied by low-grade fever, localized erythema, and/or generalized rash. The rash was often
diffuse, erythematous, nonpruritic, and maculopapular in
character. One patient also experienced bone pain concurrently with TFR that resolved with resolution of the TFR.
Six of 45 patients also had an increase in their circulating
leukemic cells (CD19þ/CD5þ) in the peripheral blood
that eventually resolved with continued treatment (Table
1). The clinical characteristics of a typical TFR are illustrated in Figure 1.

RESULTS
Patients
A total of 45 patients were enrolled on this clinical study.
The patients had a median age of 64 years and had
received a median of 3 prior treatments. Among the
patients enrolled, 80% were male, 64% had advanced Rai
stage, and 51% overexpressed zeta-associated protein
(ZAP)-70 protein (Table 2).
Occurrence of TFR
Thirty patients (67%) experienced a TFR, 20 of which
(67%) were grade 1, 7 (23%) were grade 2, and 3 (10%)
were grade 3 (Table 2). The onset of the TFR was
recorded as early when it occurred within 24 hours of the
first dose of lenalidomide and, in >90% of cases, was
noted only during the first treatment cycle. The median
time interval from the initiation of lenalidomide treatment to the occurrence of a TFR was 6 days (range, 0
days-56 days). The median time to resolution of the TFR
was 14 days (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 10 days26 days). In Group A (n ¼ 29 patients), 18 (62%)

patients experienced TFR at the 25-mg dose and 1 patient
developed TFR at the 15-mg dose. The median lenalidomide dose at the time of TFR in Group A was 25 mg
(range, 15 mg-25 mg). The majority of TFRs occurring in
Group A were of grade 1 in severity (53%), followed by
37% with grade 2 and 11% with grade 3.
Of the patients in Group B (starting dose of 10 mg),
only 12 patients reached the 25-mg dose through dose
escalation. Six patients required 42 days and 3 patients
required >100 days (105 days, 133 days, and 182 days,
respectively) to reach the 25-mg dose. Four patients did
not reach 25 mg. The time to escalate to 25 mg of lenalidomide was computed (using censored data for patients
who did not reach the 25-mg dose). The median time to
reach the 25-mg dose of lenalidomide for these 16
patients was 46 days from the initiation of treatment
(95% CI, 42 days-63 days). Among patients starting at
the 10-mg dose (n ¼ 16), 9 experienced TFR at the 10mg dose and 2 patients experienced a TFR at a dose of 20
mg of lenalidomide. The median lenalidomide dose at the
time of TFR in Group B was 10 mg (range, 10 mg-20
mg). In Group B, nearly all TFRs (91%) were grade 1,
with none reported as grade 2 and only 1 patient (9%)
experiencing a grade 3 TFR.
Risk Factors for TFR
We further analyzed the baseline clinical features of
patients to ascertain risk factors predictive of TFR. We
observed a statistically significant difference in the median
age of the patients who either developed or did not develop a TFR (61 years vs 71 years, respectively; P ¼ .004
using the 2-sided Wilcoxon test). Furthermore, patients
who developed a TFR tended to have a higher stage of disease (73% with Rai stage III-IV disease vs 47% incidence),

2129

Original Article

although this did not reach statistical significance (P ¼
.08). To determine whether the increased incidence of
TFR in patients with a higher disease stage was because of
bulky disease, we correlated the presence of bulky disease
(defined as any single lymph mode mass measuring 5 cm

in any single dimension) with the clinical disease stage of
the patients. The incidence of bulky disease in patients
with Rai stage I, II/III, and IV disease was 100%, 50%,
and 62%, respectively. There was no significant difference
noted with regard to the incidence of TFR among patients
with bulky versus nonbulky disease (65% [n ¼ 17] vs
63% [n ¼ 5]; P ¼ 1.00). Furthermore, there was no significant association noted between TFR and gender,
number of prior therapies, baseline absolute lymphocyte
count, or ZAP-70 status in either group (P >.1).
Effect on Immune Cellular Microenvironment
Lenalidomide modulates the components of the immune
cellular microenvironment and this might be an important mechanism underlying development of the TFR.
Therefore, we investigated in a subset of patients (n ¼ 18)
whether baseline levels of immune effector cells including
NK and T-lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood correlated with the occurrence and intensity of TFR.
NK Cells
Pretreatment NK cell levels were analyzed as described
earlier. We investigated whether pretreatment NK cell levels predict the intensity of a TFR. The median pretreatment NK cell level in patients with grade 1 versus those
with grade 2 and 3 TFRs was 264 cells/mm3 (range, 361355) and 579 cells/mm3 (range, 164-2439), respectively
(Fig. 2A). Using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, we found a
statistically significant relation between pretreatment NK
cell level and the intensity of the TFR (P ¼ .05). We
observed that individuals who developed more intense
TFRs (grades 2 and 3) had a higher baseline NK cell level

Figure 1. Clinical features of tumor flare reaction (TFR) are
shown. (A) TFR manifesting as a tender increase in the size
of a left cervical lymph node with overlying erythema after 7
days of therapy with lenalidomide is shown in a patient with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The TFR resolved completely
after 2 months with continued therapy. (B) TFR presenting as
lower back pain because of a sudden increase in the size of
retroperitoneal lymph nodes after 7 days of treatment with
lenalidomide is shown. It completely resolved after continued
treatment. The arrow identifies retroperitoneal lymph nodes
noted on computed tomography scan at baseline (pretreatment), during TFR, and at the time of resolution. (C) In some
patients, TFR can also present as an increase in the absolute
lymphocyte count (ALC) in the peripheral blood. Six patients
demonstrated an increase in peripheral blood ALC as a manifestation of TFR. Kinetics of ALC in the peripheral blood circulation of these patients is noted in this figure showing an
initial increase in the ALC with lenalidomide treatment, which
subsequently resolved with continued treatment.

compared with those with less intense or no TFRs (grades

elevated baseline NK cell levels appeared to have a better
quality of response to lenalidomide; among the 5 patients
who achieved a CR, all but 1 patient had a normal or elevated baseline NK cell level. The median pretreatment NK
cell level among patients with a clinical response (CR and
partial response) compared with those with no response [all
others]) was 448 cells/mm3 (range, 100-2439) and 303
cells/mm3 (range, 36-609), respectively. Clinical outcome
(response vs no response) was compared using a logistic
regression model and did not conclusively establish an association between pretreatment NK cell level and clinical outcome (P ¼ .24). The 2 patients with stable disease also had
elevated baseline NK cell levels, indicating that other as yet

unidentified factors may also be important in the antileukemic effect of lenalidomide in patients with CLL.
T Cells

(CD8þ) cells were analyzed as described earlier (Figs. 2B2D). A logistic regression model was used to determine an
effect from T cells with respect to TFR grade (grade 1 vs
grade 2 and grade 3). The logarithmic transform of the T
cell count was used. The median number of CD4þ cells

grade 2 and grade 3 TFRs was 575 cells/mm3 (range, 1412080) and 873 (range, 494-4021), respectively (P ¼ .15).
Using the Kruskal-Wallis test, we observed no significant
relation between of baseline CD4þ counts and the intensity of the TFR (P ¼ .9). It is interesting to note that the
baseline level of CD8þ cytotoxic cells was found to be
correlated with the intensity of the TFR (P ¼ .05). In
addition, the CD4/CD8 ratio at baseline was found to be
a strong indicator of the intensity of the TFR (P ¼ .01).
Management of TFR
In our clinical trial, management of the TFR included the
use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
(ibuprofen at a dose of 400-600 mg every 4-6 hours) with
or without oral morphine sulfate (5-10 mg every 4-6
hours as needed) for additional pain control. Overall, 11

2132

(37%) of the 30 patients exhibiting a TFR required treatment with ibuprofen; 7 (23%) were in Group A and 4
(13.3%) were in Group B. Only 3 (10%) patients (2 in
Group A and 1 in Group B) received supplemental morphine sulfate for pain control. No patients required discontinuation of treatment or a dose reduction of
lenalidomide for a TFR. The high incidence of TFR in
Group A prompted us to investigate the prevention of this
reaction with the use of low-dose corticosteroid therapy.
None of the patients in Group A was given steroids either
for the prevention or treatment of a TFR.

impact of steroids on PFS in patients treated with lenalidomide. The median PFS for patients who did not receive
corticosteroids prophylaxis (Group A) compared with
those who did (Group B) was 23 months versus 17.8
months, respectively (P ¼ .74 by the log-rank test and P

was compared among patients with or without a TFR.
Despite a low sample size in our analysis, the probability
of achieving a CR with lenalidomide alone was found to
be correlated with the intensity of the TFR (Fig. 3). At the
time of last follow-up, 8 patients had achieved a CR (5 in
Group A and 3 in Group B). Among the 15 patients without a TFR, only 1 CR (7%) was observed versus 7 (23%)
patients in the TFR group. Among patients with a grade 1
TFR, there were 4 CRs in 20 patients (20%); among
patients with a grade 2 TFR, there were 2 CRs in 7
patients (29%); and among those with a grade 3 TFR,
there was 1 CR in 3 patients (33&percnt;). The median
progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with or without a TFR was 19.9 months and 19.4 months, respectively (P ¼ .92).
Impact of Steroid Prophylaxis and Slow Dose
Escalation
The impact of slow dose escalation of lenalidomide and
low-dose corticosteroid prophylaxis was evaluated by
comparing Groups A and B. Nineteen (66%) patients in
Group A and 11 (69%) patients in Group B developed a
TFR (P ¼ .83, chi-square test). Among these individuals,
grade 2 and 3 TFRs were observed in 9 patients (47%)
and 1 patient (9%) n Groups A and B, respectively (P ¼
.05). The median time to the onset of the TFR was 4 days
in Group A and 9 days in Group B (P ¼ .01). The median
time to resolution of a TFR was 13 days in Group A and
26 days in Group B (P ¼ .16). We further evaluated the

DISCUSSION
Lenalidomide is clinically active as a single agent in
patients with CLL. Two clinical studies in patients with
recurrent or refractory CLL reported response rates of
58% and 32%, respectively, with lenalidomide monotherapy.5,12 In the current study, TFR, an adverse event
that to our knowledge has not been reported with lenalidomide treatment in patients with other disease entities,
occurred in 67% of individuals with CLL who were
treated with lenalidomide. These rates are lower than
observed in the previous study by Andritsos et al, who
reported serious TFRs in 3 of 4 patients (75%), although
the differences in lenalidomide dose, TFR prophylaxis
administration, study population, and total patient numbers could account for these differences.13
In the current study, the use of an NSAID, ibuprofen, was effective in managing the pain associated with
TFR and rarely oral morphine sulfate was administered
for severe pain. We observed that prophylaxis with prednisone decreased the severity but not the incidence of
TFR. In our experience, TFR was well tolerated, with
none of the patients requiring discontinuation or a dose
reduction of therapy.
Lenalidomide-associated TFR was characterized by
a proinflammatory clinical picture suggestive of an
immune-mediated tumor recognition phenomenon. We
note that the immunomodulatory activity of lenalidomide
in vivo may be integrally related to the development of the
TFR.14 The presence of an adequate amount of NK cells
in peripheral blood circulation appeared to be correlated
with the intensity of the TFR and also improved the
response to therapy. Pre-existing immune factors (such as
NK cells) that are associated with clinical response to lenalidomide suggest that lenalidomide requires immune
components for its antitumor activity. We observed a
higher intensity of TFR in patients who initiated therapy
with lenalidomide at a higher dose and without prophylaxis and the intensity of the TFR appeared to be correlated with a higher probability of achieving a CR. The

exact clinical impact of TFR remains uncertain; although
our analysis was limited by small sample size, it did not
demonstrate any benefit in the PFS despite a higher CR
rate in the TFR group. A potential clinical significance of
TFR maybe a high probability of achieving a CR, which
in turn may be associated with an improved PFS. In the
clinical trial reported by Ferrajoli et al, no association
between TFR and response was noted.12 The disparity in
this observation may reflect different patient populations
and variable dosing schedules as well as starting dose.
Ongoing clinical trials with a large sample size should be
able answer this question.
The identification and careful characterization of a
TFR is important in the treatment of CLL patients with
lenalidomide to avoid unnecessary morbidity or the premature discontinuation of effective therapy. We recommend close monitoring of patients with CLL for signs of
TFR (ie, enlargement of lymph nodes, rash, and changes
in the ALC) during the first 10 days of lenalidomide therapy. It is particularly important to monitor lymph nodes
close to the liver and kidneys. If a TFR occurs, we recommend treatment with an NSAID such as ibuprofen (at a
dose of 400- 600 mg every 6 hours), with steroid use considered only in cases of more intense TFRs. Although in
the current study we did not need to withhold or reduce
the dose of lenalidomide out of concerns for TFR, in
severe cases of TFR this may be warranted along with steroid treatment. Alternatively, a slow dose escalation strategy such as that used in Group B in the current study may
reduce the intensity of TFR and should be considered.
The dose of lenalidomide can be increased again once the
TFR subsides. In severe cases, therapy with low-dose corticosteroids can be used to decrease the severity of the
TFR although, as previously discussed, this can potentially undermine antitumor responses. In our experience,
it is not necessary to discontinue lenalidomide therapy for
a TFR.
In conclusion, the occurrence of a TFR appears to
result from the immune-stimulating activity of lenalidomide in patients with CLL. Preclinical evaluations suggest
that 1 possibly important effect of lenalidomide may be
the activation of T cell-mediated anti-CLL effects.
Although these in vitro observations add new information
regarding the potential immunologic effect of lenalidomide and thus may explain clinical immunologic phenomenon such as TFR, clinical validations are pending.15
Our clinical observation that the intensity of the TFR is
correlated with the probability of achieving a CR is interesting and requires further validation and may suggest

2134

that this is an important phenomenon linked to lenalidomide’s response in patients with CLL. Because of its high
incidence, its considerable morbidity, and its clinical presentation resembling progressive disease, the early recognition and accurate diagnosis of TFR is imperative for the
effective use of lenalidomide in patients with CLL. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the development of the lenalidomide-associated TFR in patients
with CLL.
