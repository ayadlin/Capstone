MDC1 Cleavage by Caspase-3: A Novel Mechanism
for Inactivating the DNA Damage Response
during Apoptosis
phanie Solier and Yves Pommier
Ste

Abstract
Recently, we identified the "apoptotic ring," containing phosphorylated histone H2AX (g-H2AX), as an early
chromatin modification during apoptosis. Because g-H2AX initiates the DNA damage response (DDR), we
tested whether the apoptotic H2AX response leads to the full recruitment of the DDR factors that normally
coordinate DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints. We show that the apoptotic H2AX response does not
recruit the DDR factors because MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1), which normally
binds to g-H2AX in response to DNA damage and amplifies the DDR, is cleaved by caspase-3. This cleavage
separates the BRCT and FHA domains of MDC1 and constitutes a novel mechanism for the inactivation of
DNA repair in apoptotic cells. Also, we show that downregulation of MDC1 increases the apoptotic response
to TRAIL. Together, these results implicate MDC1 in the cellular apoptotic response. Cancer Res; 71(3); 906–13.

Introduction
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is required in multicellular organisms for organ formation, elimination of
damaged or harmful cells, and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Disruption of the equilibrium between cell death and
proliferation leads to tumor formation when cells divide faster
than they die (1). Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that
cleave and inactivate a broad range of cellular proteins, have
been identified as the central effectors of apoptosis (2, 3).
One promising approach for cancer therapy is the development of targeted agents that selectively kill tumor cells by
activating caspases. One such agent is recombinant human
Apo2L/TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), a
proapoptotic agonist that activates the membrane death
receptors DR4 and DR5. Human endogenous TRAIL is
expressed by immune cells as a 281-amino acid polypeptide
involved in the innate immune response, autoimmunity, and
tumor immunosurveillance (4–6). Recombinant Apo2L/TRAIL
is presently in phase II clinical trials against lymphomas and
non–small cell lung cancers (7).

We recently identified the "apoptotic ring" as the nuclear
peripheral staining of phosphorylated histone H2AX
(g-H2AX; refs. 8, 9). The g-H2AX apoptotic ring forms in
the early phase of the apoptotic response to a broad range
of stimuli including TRAIL. g-H2AX (histone H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139 by ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK) is
otherwise a fundamental chromatin response to DNA double-strand breaks (10), serving as a molecular platform for
the docking of protein complexes to chromatin and the
amplification the DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA
repair (10, 11). Direct binding of MDC1 (mediator of DNA
damage checkpoint protein 1) to g-H2AX via the MDC1
BRCT (breast cancer C-terminal) domain (12) is essential
for DDR because it leads to the subsequent recruitment and
assembly of DDR protein complexes including 53BP1 that
repair DNA and regulate cell-cycle checkpoints (13, 14).
Recruitment of MDC1 at DNA damage sites is critical for
the efficient activation of the intra S-phase checkpoint (15).
MDC1 couples DNA double-strand break recognition by
Nbs1 (a member of the MRN complex containing Mre11,
Rad50, and Nbs1) with its H2AX-dependent chromatin
retention (16). Accordingly, MDC1/ mice recapitulate
the phenotype of the H2AX/ mice, including growth
retardation, male infertility, immune defects, chromosome
instability, DNA repair defects, and radiation sensitivity
(17).
The focus of the present study was to determine whether
the apoptotic g-H2AX response (apoptotic g-H2AX ring;
refs. 8, 9) is associated with the recruitment of the DDR
complexes and the role of MDC1 and phosphorylation
of H2AX at its C-terminal tyrosine 142 (18–20) in that
process.

DDR Inactivation during Apoptosis

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Recombinant human soluble TRAIL was obtained from
Alexis (Axxora). Anti-Fas was purchased from Upstate. Camptothecin and cisplatin were from Sigma-Aldrich. The broadspectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (z-Val-Ala-DL-Aspfluoromethylketone) was from Bachem and the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell lines
Human colon carcinoma HCT116 and leukemic Jurkat cell
lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
Normal human prostate epithelial PrEC cell line was obtained
from Lonza.
Western blotting and antibodies
Cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed at 4 C in buffer
containing 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), 10 mmol/L TrisHCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche
Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich).
Viscosity of the samples was reduced by brief sonication. Equal
amounts of proteins were boiled for 5 minutes in Tris-glycineSDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) or heated at 70 C for 10 minutes
in LDS (lithium dodecyl sulphate) sample buffer (Invitrogen),
separated by Tris-glycine or Tris-acetate polyacrylamide gels
(Invitrogen) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Bio-Rad). The membranes were saturated with milk, incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies, washed, and
then incubated for 45 minutes with secondary antibodies:
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Signals were revealed by autoradiography with the Enhanced
Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (Pierce).
Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-caspase-2
(551094; BD Biosciences), anti-PT2609-DNA-PK (ab18356;
Abcam), anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 2118; Cell Signaling), anti-g-H2AX (05-636; Upstate),
anti-PY142-H2AX (07-1590; Millipore), anti-H2AX (07-627;
Upstate), anti-MDC1 (ab11169; Abcam), and anti-tubulin
(MS-581; Lab Vision).
Short interfering RNA
Short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MDC1 was
obtained from Dharmacon (SMARTpool, catalogue number
M-003506-04-0005). Negative control siRNA was obtained
from Ambion (catalogue number AM4635). Cells were seeded
in 6-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells per well 16 hours
before transfection. For each sample, 500 pmoles of siRNA
were mixed with 250 mL of Optimem (Invitrogen; mix A). Five
microliters of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was mixed with
250 mL of Optimem and incubated for 5 minutes at room
temperature (mix B). After combining mixes A and B, reactions were further incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature before adding the siRNA/Lipofectamine complexes
in 2 mL of culture medium. After 5 hours, the medium was
replaced with regular medium and cells were incubated for a
further 96 hours.

Plasmid vector
The GFP-MDC1 construct used has been previously
described (21).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde in
PBS for 20 minutes, washed with PBS, postfixed and permeabilized with cold (20 C) 70% ethanol for 20 minutes, washed
with PBS, blocked with 8% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS

(PT2609-DNA-PK, 1/250 dilution; g-H2AX, 1/500 dilution; PY142H2AX, 1/250 dilution; MDC1, 1/200 dilution) in 1% BSA in PBS
for 2 hours, washed with PBS, incubated with secondary
antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 for 1 hour,
washed with PBS, and mounted by using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were
sequentially acquired with Zeiss AIM software on a Zeiss
LSM 510 NLO Confocal system (Carl Zeiss Inc.).
Sub-G1 analysis
Cells were washed with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized with
cold (20 C) 70% ethanol overnight. The next day, cell pellets
were washed again with PBS, resuspended in PBS buffer
containing 0.2% NP40 and 0.5 mg/mL of RNase A, incubated
at room temperature for 15 minutes, and put on ice 10
minutes before the addition of 50 mg/mL of propidium iodide.
DNA content was determined with a FACScan flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson) and quantified with CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson).
Site-directed mutagenesis
Point mutations were introduced into the MDC1 expression
vector with the "QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit" (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. MDC1 expression vector was used with the
relevant oligonucleotides, and PCR was carried out for 18
cycles. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Primers

In vitro translation–in vitro caspase cleavage assay
In vitro translation was carried out with a coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega)
according to the manufacturer's protocol by using
[35S]methionine (Amersham). A mixture of 6 mL of lysate, 6
mL of buffer, () 1 mL of recombinant caspase (R&D Systems),
() 1 mL of caspase inhibitor 2 mmol/L, and buffer (50 mmol/L
HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS {3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate}, 10
mmol/L EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mmol/L dithiothreitol) was
obtained for a total volume of 12 mL. Ten microliters of
reticulocyte lysate were boiled for 5 minutes in Tris-glycine-SDS sample buffer, separated by 4% to 20% Tris-glycine
polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried, and the radioactive
signals were detected by autoradiography.

Results
Mutual exclusion between the apoptotic ring and
phosphorylation of H2AX on tyrosine 142
Whether the apoptotic g-H2AX response (8–10) is coupled
with the full recruitment/activation of the DDR factors has
recently been questioned (9, 19). Indeed, endogenous phosphorylation of H2AX on its last residue (tyrosine 142; PY142H2AX) has been shown to prevent the binding of MDC1 to the
neighboring phosphorylated serine 139 (g-H2AX; refs. 18, 20)
and retention of Y142 phosphorylation (PY142-H2AX) proposed
to drive the apoptotic response (18). Because this explanation
was apparently consistent with our prior observation that
53BP1 (p53 binding protein 1, one of the DDR chromatin
binding factors downstream of g-H2AX and MDC1) fails to
associate with the apoptotic g-H2AX ring (9), we tested phosphorylation of H2AX at tyrosine 142 (PY142-H2AX) during
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Unexpectedly, we found that tyro-

908

Cancer Res; 71(3) February 1, 2011

sine 142 phosphorylation (PY142-H2AX) decreases after TRAIL
treatment whereas g-H2AX increases (Fig. 1A). The changes in
opposite direction of g-H2AX and PY142-H2AX were confirmed
by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B). To avoid interference
between the g-H2AX antibody and the PY142-H2AX antibody
due to the proximity of the epitopes (residues 139 and 142), we
used phospho-DNA–dependent protein kinase (PT2609-DNAPK) antibody instead of the g-H2AX antibody, knowing that
PT2609-DNA-PK has the same staining as g-H2AX during apoptosis (8, 9). Figure 1B shows that apoptotic cells that stain for
PT2609-DNA-PK are negative or very weak for PY142-H2AX,
further showing the mutual exclusion between the apoptotic
ring and phosphorylation of H2AX on tyrosine 142.
MDC1 and 53BP1 are not recruited to the apoptotic
ring
Our finding that PY142-H2AX decreases during apoptosis
questions the hypothesis of Cook and colleagues (18) stating
that sustained phosphorylation on tyrosine 142 is the main
mechanism for preventing the binding of MDC1 to g-H2AX
during apoptosis. We found that MDC1 staining was significantly reduced in the g-H2AX–positive apoptotic cells (Fig. 2A
and B). Thus, our experiments show that during apoptosis,
and contrary to ionizing radiation (Fig. 2A), MDC1 tends to
decrease and is not recruited to g-H2AX, which, in turn,
probably explains why 53BP1 is not recruited to the apoptotic
g-H2AX ring (9). Notably, after UV damage, which like apoptosis produces a diffuse pan-staining g-H2AX response, 53BP1
does not colocalize with g-H2AX (22, 23).
MDC1 cleavage and inactivation by caspase-3
Next, we used Western blotting to analyze MDC1 in apoptotic cells. Figure 3A and B shows that full-length MDC1
disappears rapidly during TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Concomitantly, TRAIL treatment induces the appearance of a 70kDa polypeptide that reacts with the MDC1 antibody (Fig. 3A
and B, asterisk). The 70-kDa band is decreased by downregulation of MDC1 with siRNA, indicating it is derived from
MDC1 (Fig. 3A). These experiments suggested cleavage of
MDC1 in cells undergoing apoptosis. Apoptotic MDC1 cleavage seems a general process, as we also found it following
treatment with Fas antibody (Supplementary Fig. 1A), as well
as in response to the anticancer agents, camptothecin, and
cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Moreover, apoptotic MDC1
cleavage was observed in both cancer and normal (prostate
epithelial) cells (Supplementary Fig. 1C).
To confirm that MDC1 cleavage at the early phase of
apoptosis was related to caspases, HCT116 cells were treated
with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (24)
together with TRAIL. The apoptotic MDC1 cleavage (disappearance of full-length MDC1 and appearance of the 70-kDa
MDC1 band) was both suppressed by the broad-spectrum ZVAD-fmk (24) but not by the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(Fig. 3B). Because caspase-3 is the main effector caspase, which
migrates to the nucleus during apoptosis (25, 26) whereas
caspase-2 is primarily nuclear as MDC1 (3), we tested which
of those two caspases was responsible for the cleavage of
MDC1. Expression of MDC1 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates

enabled us to carry out in vitro cleavage assays with recombinant caspases. Figure 3C shows that caspase-3 but not caspase2 cleaves MDC1 at multiple sites. Next, we searched caspase-3
consensus sequences in MDC1 (3, 27) and mutated 19 potential
caspase-3 target sites at aspartate residues (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Mutation of aspartate 173 to alanine partially abolished
caspase-3–mediated MDC1 cleavage (Fig. 3D). This caspase-3
disjoins the N-terminus of MDC1 (see Fig. 5).
To determine the impact of MDC1 inactivation on TRAILinduced apoptosis, we tested the effects of TRAIL in HCT116
cells with MDC1 downregulation by siRNA. Figure 4A–C
shows that downregulation of MDC1 increases TRAILinduced DNA fragmentation and caspase-2 activation. These
data indicate an active participation of MDC1 in promoting
apoptosis. It is not excluded that the effect of MDC1 on
apoptosis could be indirect. Inactivation of MDC1 could

www.aacrjournals.org

impair DNA repair, leading to excessive DNA damage and
consequently enhance apoptosis.

Discussion
MDC1 is a large protein (2,090 amino acids; 226 kDa) and
the caspase-3 cleavage site at position 173 is sufficient in
itself to cleave MDC1 between its FHA (forkhead-associated)
and BRCT (breast cancer C-terminal) domains (Fig. 5). The
integrity of MDC1 is likely critical for DNA repair and DDR,
as g-H2AX binds the BRCT domain (12) and ATM the FHA
domain (17, 28) of MDC1. Under normal DNA repair and
checkpoint conditions, the recruitment of ATM by MDC1,
bound to chromatin via g-H2AX, leads to additional H2AX
phosphorylation, which, in turn, recruits more MDC1, 53BP1
and engages a full DDR activation (Fig. 5). Our results

show that during apoptosis, cleavage of MDC1 by caspase-3
prohibits these interactions and therefore aborts the DDR
activation (Fig. 5). Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)
constitutes another example in which disruption of BRCT
and FHA domains disturbs the assembly of DDR complexes;
the most frequent NBS1 mutations cause the scission of
Nbs1 in two distinct segments, one corresponding to the
FHA domain and the other to the ATM and Mre11 binding
sites (29). The fact that MDC1 is cleaved by caspase-3 during
apoptosis is consistent with other studies showing the
cleavage of ATM and DNA-PK, two other critical DNA
damage responsive proteins, after apoptotic stimuli (30–

www.aacrjournals.org

32). The cleavage of ATM inactivates its kinase function,
which prevents DNA repair and DNA damage signaling (31).
Similarly, the cleavage of DNA-PK in late apoptosis abrogates its activity (32).
In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism by
which caspase-mediated cleavage inactivates DNA repair and
checkpoint responses. Moreover, our finding that MDC1
inactivation tends to reduce apoptosis warrants further studies. Indeed, MDC1 inactivation has recently been found in a
significant number of breast and lung carcinomas (33, 34),
which could therefore impact on tumor cell survival and
tumorigenesis.
