of Transcription and Substrates for Nucleotide Excision
Repair in Live Mammalian Cells

Abstract
To overcome drug resistance and reduce the side effects of cisplatin, a widely used antineoplastic agent, major
efforts have been made to develop next generation platinum-based anticancer drugs. Because cisplatin–DNA
adducts block RNA polymerase II unless removed by transcription-coupled excision repair, compounds that react
similarly but elude repair are desirable. The monofunctional platinum agent pyriplatin displays antitumor activity
in mice, a cytotoxicity proﬁle in cell cultures distinct from that of cisplatin, and a unique in vitro transcription
inhibition mechanism. In this study, we incorporated pyriplatin globally or site speciﬁcally into luciferase reporter
vectors to examine its transcription inhibition proﬁles in live mammalian cells. Monofunctional pyriplatin
reacted with plasmid DNA as efﬁciently as bifunctional cisplatin and inhibited transcription as strongly as
cisplatin in various mammalian cells. Using repair-defective nucleotide excision repair (NER)-, mismatch repair-,
and single-strand break repair–deﬁcient cells, we show that NER is mainly responsible for removal of pyriplatin–
DNA adducts. These ﬁndings reveal that the mechanism by which pyriplatin generates its antitumor activity is
very similar to that of cisplatin, despite the chemically different nature of their DNA adducts, further supporting a
role for monofunctional platinum anticancer agents in human cancer therapy. This information also provides
support for the validity of the proposed mechanism of action of cisplatin and provides a rational basis for the
design of more potent platinum anticancer drug candidates using a monofunctional DNA-damaging strategy.

Introduction
cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cDDP, cisplatin) and its
close analogues carboplatin and oxaliplatin are used to treat
about half of all patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer
(Fig. 1; ref. 1). Broader application of platinum-based anticancer drugs, however, is limited by intrinsic or acquired drug
resistance and side effects including emetogenesis, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Extensive efforts have been made to
synthesize and test new platinum-based anticancer agents,
with the promise that compounds with improved antitumor
activity and fewer toxic side effects will be discovered.
The mechanism of action of platinum(II) anticancer agents
has been extensively explored, and many details of the cellular
response to these compounds are now understood. Cisplatin
attacks nuclear DNA to form Pt–DNA cross-links. The major

adducts are intrastrand cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ cross-links including
1,2-d(GpG) cross-links, which efﬁciently block RNA polymerase
II until removed by DNA damage repair pathways (2, 3). Besides
the conventional bifunctional platinum-based anticancer drugs
that contain 2 reactive sites for DNA binding, another class of
compounds, monofunctional platinum anticancer agents with
only one DNA reactive site, have been developed and tested.
Monofunctional platinum(II) complexes such as chlorodiethylenetriamineplatinum(II) chloride, [PtCl(dien)]Cl and [PtCl(NH3)3]Cl do not inhibit DNA-dependent polymerases and are
ineffective against cancer cells (4, 5). Another monofunctional
compound, the aminophosphine-containing platinum(II) complex, cis-[PtCl(C6H11NH(CH2)2PPh2-N,P)(C6H11NH(CH2)2PPh2P)], binds rapidly to DNA forming monodentate adducts at
guanine residues. Although this compound has shown anticancer activity, it only slightly inhibits DNA synthesis and has little
inﬂuence on DNA conformation (6). Some monofunctional
platinum(II)–polyamide complexes, designed for recognition of
speciﬁc DNA sequences, are capable of forming covalent bonds
with DNA, but failed to evoke better cytotoxicity against cancer
cells than cisplatin (7, 8). A series of cationic monofunctional
platinum(II) complexes, cis-[Pt(NH3)2(N-donor)Cl]þ, have been
synthesized and analyzed, and some of the compounds showed
moderate biological activity against in vivo murine tumor
models (9). Like cisplatin, these complexes inhibit DNA polymerase despite their very different DNA-binding modality
(10). The spectrum of activity of one of these compounds,

cis-diammine(pyridine)chloroplatinum(II) [cDPCP or "pyriplatin" (Fig. 1)], against a panel of human cancer cell lines differs
signiﬁcantly from those of cisplatin or oxaliplatin, rendering
pyriplatin a lead compound for generating new platinum anticancer drug candidates (11).
When attached to the N7 position of a guanine residue in
duplex DNA, pyriplatin generates no signiﬁcant structural
distortion (12). An in vitro study revealed that pyriplatin is a
substrate for nucleotide excision repair (NER), but it eludes this
repair pathway much more readily than cisplatin. Studies of
RNA polymerase II (pol II) activity on a DNA duplex containing
a single cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ-dG adduct revealed a transcription inhibition mechanism distinct from that of bifunctional
platinum compounds like cisplatin (13). An X-ray crystal
structure analysis indicated that pyriplatin bound to the N-7
position of a guanosine residue can be accommodated in the
pol II active site in which it forms a standard Watson–Crick
base pair with cytosine of the growing RNA strand. Blockage of
subsequent pol II translocation from the damaged site leads to
inhibition of the pol II transcribing complex. In contrast, for the
cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link, delivery of the damaged nucleosides to the active site is inhibited by a translocation barrier (14). Details of transcription inhibition by pyriplatin in live mammalian cells, especially in comparison to other
bifunctional platinum-based anticancer drugs, and the repair
pathways that are responsible for removal of pyriplatin–DNA
adducts, remain to be elucidated, however.
To address these deﬁciencies, we have in this study
investigated the transcription inhibition proﬁles of pyriplatin and compared them with those of cisplatin and oxaliplatin. We examined the ability of cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and
pyriplatin to inhibit the transcription of a Gaussia luciferase
reporter gene, utilizing globally platinated expression vectors in live mammalian cells. Different repair-deﬁcient cell
lines, including NER-, mismatch repair (MMR)-, and singlestrand break repair (SSBR)-deﬁcient cells, were used to
reveal repair pathways that might be involved in removal
of pyriplatin–DNA adducts. In addition, a site-speciﬁc pyriplatin–dG adduct was incorporated into the Gaussia luciferase expression vector. The transcription inhibition effects
from this single pyriplatin–dG adduct in a 3,986-bp plasmid,
as well as the mechanisms by which the repair-deﬁcient cells
process the site-speciﬁc lesion, were investigated. Our
results shed light on the transcription inhibition effects and
repair mechanisms of pyriplatin–DNA adducts. Moreover,
they provide details about the mechanisms by which this
monofunctional platinum compound generates its antitu-

Materials and Methods
Preparation of globally platinated transcription probes
For global platination experiments, 125 mg/mL (45.4 nmol/L)
of pGLuc, prepared as described in Supplementary Information, was treated with 0, 0.25, 0.51, 1.02, 2.04, and 4.07 mmol/L
cisplatin; 0, 0.23, 0.45, 0.91, 1.81, and 3.63 mmol/L oxaliplatin; or
0, 0.42, 0.84, 1.68, 3.36, and 6.71 mmol/L pyriplatin in 25 mmol/L
Na-HEPES, 10 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer for 16 hours at 37 C
in the dark. A control plasmid without platinum was treated
similarly. The reaction mixtures were then dialyzed against
water and subsequently against TE buffer (10 mmol/L TrisHCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0) to remove unbound platinum.
Quantiﬁcation of Pt content for these globally platinated
plasmids was obtained by ﬂameless atomic absorption spectroscopy on a Perkin-Elmer AAnalyst 600 system. DNA concentrations were measured by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy at 260 nm on an HP 8453 UV-visible spectrometer. The
number of platinum complexes bound per nucleotide, rb, was
computed from this information.
Preparation of a pyriplatin modiﬁed insertion strand
A 16-mer oligonucleotide containing a site-speciﬁc cis-{Pt
(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct was prepared in the following manner. A 25.7 mmol/L aqueous solution of pyriplatin was activated by addition of 0.98 equivalent of AgNO3 followed by
agitation for 8 hours in the dark at room temperature. The
suspension was centrifuged. To a 0.2 mmol/L solution of
50 -CCTCCTCG TCTCTTCC (Integrated DNA Technologies),
where the asterisk denotes the base to be platinated, in 10
mmol/L NaH2PO4, pH 6.3, was added 1.2 equivalent of activated pyriplatin. The reaction mixture was incubated overnight in the dark at 37 C. The reaction was stopped by freezing
the solution. The pyriplatin-modiﬁed insertion strand was
puriﬁed by ion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography [Agilent 1200 HPLC system, Dionex DNAPac PA-100,
linear gradient, 0.34 to 0.45 mol/L NaCl in 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4) over 11 minutes]. After puriﬁcation, the platinated
DNA solution was dialyzed against H2O and lyophilized. The
platination level was conﬁrmed by UV-visible and atomic
absorption spectroscopy, which yielded a Pt/DNA ratio of
1.03  0.01. The insertion strand was further analyzed for
nucleotide composition by enzyme digestion to conﬁrm the

Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. PARP-1þ/þ and PARP-1/ mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFS) were kindly provided by Prof. Paul Chang at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. HEC59 and HEC59þ
Chr2 cells were obtained from Dr. Thomas Kunkel from NIH.
All cells were grown in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 C under
5% CO2. XPF, U2OS-MOCK, and XPF-1128 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with
10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. XPFcorr cells were
maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS, 0.5 mg/mL G418 sulfate,
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HEC59 cells were grown in
DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. HEC59þChr2 cells were grown in DMEM/F12
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and
0.4 mg/mL G418 sulfate. PARP-1þ/þ and PARP-1/ MEFS
were maintained in DMEM medium with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin.

Preparation of site-speciﬁcally platinated plasmids
Site-speciﬁcally platinated pGLuc8temG plasmid containing a cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct between the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the luciferase expression gene
was prepared following the strategy published previously (16).
The gapped plasmid was obtained with the use of Nt.BbvCI and
Nt.BspQI nicking restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs),
followed by annealing with excess 24-mer complementary
strand to remove the nicked strand. A 300 mg quantity of
pGLuc8temG plasmid was digested with 15 U of Nt.BbvCI at
37 C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was heated at 80 C for 20
minutes to deactivate the enzyme and then extracted with
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol to remove the enzyme.
The resulting aqueous phase was dialyzed against H2O overnight at 4 C. The plasmid was further digested with 15 U Nt.
BspQI at 50 C for 1 hour, and the enzyme was heat deactivated
and removed by a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction. The nicked plasmid was mixed with 1000 equivalent of
complementary DNA strand 50 -TTTTGGAAGAGACGAGGAGGTTTT in a buffer of 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 2 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.4 mol/L NaCl, pH 7.4, heated at 80 C for 5 minutes,
and subsequently cooled at 4 C for 5 minutes for 10 cycles. The
gapped plasmid was puriﬁed by isopycnic centrifugation using
a CsCl gradient at 58,000 rpm, 20 C for 24 hours, and quantitated by UV-visible spectroscopy.
The 16-mer insertion strands, either containing a site-speciﬁc cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct or no platinum, were
phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 C for 3
hours. The enzyme was removed by a phenol/chloroform/
isoamyl alcohol extraction. The phosphorylated strands were
ethanol precipitated and stored at 80 C at a concentration of
100 pmol/mL. A 120 mg quantity of the gapped plasmid was
annealed with 100 equivalent of the insertion strand in a buffer
of 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.4 mol/L NaCl, pH
7.4 from 90 C to 4 C at 1 C/min in a thermocycler, followed
by a ligation with 240 U T4 DNA ligase at 16 C for 16 hours.
The platinated plasmid was dialyzed against H2O at 4 C
overnight and further puriﬁed by treatment with 30 U of
BsmBI at 55 C for 1 hour. The closed circular form of plasmid
was puriﬁed and concentrated by isopycnic centrifugation,
followed by n-butanol extraction and ethanol precipitation.
The plasmids were quantitated by a Quant-iT PicoGreen
dsDNA kit (Invitrogen) and stored at 80 C in TE buffer.
To carry out a restriction analysis on ligated platinated or
unplatinated plasmids, a 60 ng quantity of pGLuc8temG
plasmid was incubated with 2 U BsmBI at 55 C for 30 minutes.
The plasmids were analyzed using 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis containing 0.5 mg/mL ethidium bromide. The gels
were documented with a BioRad Fluor-S MultiImager.

Transcription inhibition strategy
To investigate the extent to which pyriplatin–DNA adducts
inhibit transcription and to gauge possible mechanisms for
repairing its monofunctional adducts, transcription assays
were carried out using platinated mammalian expression
vectors in live mammalian cells of different origin (Supplementary Table S1). A Gaussia luciferase expression vector,
pGLuc, which encodes a secretable form of the enzyme under
control of a CMV promoter, was employed. Pyriplatin was
incorporated into pGLuc either globally or site speciﬁcally
between the CMV promoter and the luciferase gene. Platinated
and unplatinated control plasmids were transfected into cells
with cationic liposomes. Subsequently, the cell media containing the secreted luciferase were collected at various time
intervals. An advantage of the secreted luciferase system is
that a time-dependent cellular response to the platinated
plasmids can be monitored without lysing the cells, as is
necessary using other internal reporter enzyme systems (18,
19). The transcription inhibition activity of pyriplatin, and of
cisplatin and oxaliplatin as controls, was determined by quantiﬁcation of expressed luciferase using coelenterazine as substrate. NER-, MMR-, and SSBR-deﬁcient cells were employed
both to monitor transcription inhibition activity of pyriplatin
and to identify potential repair mechanisms of pyriplatin–DNA
adducts in live cells.

XPF (GM08437) cells were obtained from the Coriell Cell
Depositories at Coriell Institute. XPFcorr cells were generously

nucleotide (rb) in the reaction is plotted against the formal
ratio of platinum to nucleotide (rf) for cisplatin, oxaliplatin,
and pyriplatin. The slope of the rb versus rf plot for pyriplatin is
identical to that of cisplatin, but much larger than that for
oxaliplatin. In other words, pyriplatin reacts with DNA as
efﬁciently as cisplatin, and both compounds react more efﬁciently than oxaliplatin.
Construction of a plasmid containing a site-speciﬁc
pyriplatin monofunctional adduct
A GLuc vector containing a site-speciﬁc cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–
dG adduct was constructed following the "gapping" strategy
reported previously (16). pGLuc was modiﬁed to include 2 unique
nicking restriction sites, Nt.BbvCI and Nt.BspQI, for incorporation of 16-mer insertion strands containing either a sitespeciﬁc cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct or no platinum (Fig. 3).
This new plasmid, pGLuc8temG, was then digested with the
nicking restriction enzymes Nt.BbvCI and Nt.BspQI to obtain the
desired gapped plasmid. The 16-mer insertion strands, containing either a site-speciﬁc pyriplatin adduct or no platinum, were
annealed and ligated into the gapped plasmids to form the ﬁnal
constructs. The site-speciﬁcally platinated and unplatinated
control plasmids were designated as pGLuc8temGþIS-PtPy and

Transcription inhibition proﬁles of pyriplatin in
NER-deﬁcient cells
Transcription inhibition proﬁles were obtained for globally
and site-speciﬁcally platinated probes in NER-deﬁcient cells.
Plasmids were transfected into XPF cells, which lack the XPF
gene, and into XPFcorr cells, in which the XPF function was
restored by introduction of the cDNA for XPF (20). pGLuc
globally platinated with pyriplatin was examined ﬁrst, and
expression levels were read after 8, 16, 24, 32, and 44 hours of
incubation. GLuc expression levels normalized to that of
unplatinated plasmid were plotted as a function of Pt/DNA
ratios at various time points (Fig. 4), or as a function of time at
speciﬁc Pt/DNA ratios (Supplementary Fig. S2). After 44 hours,
the transcription levels were substantially restored in both
cell lines, indicating repair of pyriplatin–DNA adducts. There
was stronger transcription inhibition by pyriplatin in XPF
cells. For example, at a Pt/DNA ratio of 23.2, the transcription level recovered from 19.8% at 8 hours to 43.4% at 44
hours in XPF cells, whereas in XPFcorr cells, transcription
recovered from 27.0% at 8 hours to 56.3% at 44 hours. In
addition, D0 values, where D0 is the number of Pt adducts per
plasmid required to reduce transcription levels to 37% of
control (21), were obtained to quantitate transcription inhibition differences between the 2 cell lines (Table 1). The
increase in D0 values at different time points indicates
restoration of transcription, and the higher D0 values in
XPFcorr cells suggest a role for NER in repairing pyriplatin–
DNA damage.
Transcription proﬁles of site-speciﬁcally platinated pGLuc
in XPF and XPFcorr cells were also determined. The transcription levels from a plasmid carrying a single, site-speciﬁc
pyriplatin–DNA adduct were 37%, 49%, and 54% in XPF cells,
and 80%, 115%, and 123% in XPFcorr cells at 24, 48, and 72
hours, respectively. We also studied site-speciﬁc pGLuc plasmids containing a cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ intrastrand 1,2-d(GpG)
cross-link, the major type of cisplatin–DNA adduct, as a
control. Transcription levels in the presence of the cis-{Pt
(NH3)2}2þ 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link were 53%, 59%, and 62% in
XPF cells and 102%, 128%, and 132% in XPFcorr cells at 24, 48,
and 72 hours, respectively (Fig. 5). Transcription levels more
than 100% after 48 hours in XPFcorr cells for both cisplatin and
pyriplatin suggest, perhaps, the stimulation of transcription
from newly repaired plasmids. Restoration of XPF function
signiﬁcantly decreased the transcription inhibition induced by
a site-speciﬁc pyriplatin–dG adduct, further conﬁrming that
NER can remove pyriplatin adducts on DNA. The results from a
cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ 1,2-d(GpG) cross-linked plasmid are in agreement with our previously published data (17), reinforcing the
pivotal role of NER in the repair of cisplatin–DNA cross-links. It
is noteworthy that a cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG monofunctional
adduct inhibits transcription better than a cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ
1,2-d(GpG) cross-link in XPF cells.

was also observed in XPF-1128 cells (Fig. 6). Calculated D0

In addition to cells deﬁcient in NER, MMR-deﬁcient (HEC59)
and MMR-proﬁcient (HEC59þChr2) cells were examined in

to investigate the potential role of MMR in removing Pt–DNA
adducts, including those from cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and pyriplatin. For cisplatin, there was slightly more transcription
inhibition in MMR-proﬁcient compared with MMR-deﬁcient
cells over 44 hours (Supplementary Fig. S6). Transcription
levels increased over 44 hours in both HEC59 and HEC59þChr2
cells. At an adduct level of 19.4 Pt/DNA, transcription increased
from 19.2% to 35.2% of control in HEC59 cells and from 10.1% to
31.6% in HEC59þChr2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). There was
identical transcription inhibition of oxaliplatin in MMR-deﬁcient and MMR-proﬁcient cells, and little recovery over time in
both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7). As for pyriplatinmodiﬁed transcription probes, there were identical transcription proﬁles in both MMR-deﬁcient and MMR-proﬁcient cells
over 44 hours, and slightly greater transcription inhibition
occurred in HEC59þChr2 cells (Fig. 7). D0 values for cisplatin,
oxaliplatin, and pyriplatin in both cell lines are shown in
Supplementary Table S3. Pyriplatin and cisplatin have identical D0 values in HEC59 and HEC59þChr2 cells, and the
values are greater than those of oxaliplatin. There was a small

Transcription inhibition proﬁles of pyriplatin in PARP-1
knockdown cells
PARP-1 knockdown MEFS were studied to reveal the transcription inhibition proﬁles of cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and pyriplatin. A small recovery in transcription levels was observed
for all 3 platinum compounds tested, especially in PARP-1þ/þ
cells (Supplementary Figs. S9 and S10). Pyriplatin had
D0 values identical to those of cisplatin and oxaliplatin in
PARP-1þ/þ and PARP-1/ cells (Supplementary Table S4),
further indicating that pyriplatin inhibits transcription as
strongly as cisplatin and oxaliplatin. A slight increase of
D0 values occurred from 8 and 44 hours in both cell lines for
cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and pyriplatin, and the D0 values were
slightly smaller in PARP-1/ cells.
The transcription proﬁles of site-speciﬁcally platinated
pGLuc in PARP-1þ/þ and PARP-1/ cells were also determined. Transcription levels in the presence of a site-speciﬁc
cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct were 46%, 56%, and 76% in

Transcription assays with site-speciﬁcally platinated plasmids showed identical results to those obtained for globally
platinated transcription probes. Site-speciﬁc pGLuc plasmids
containing a cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link or a cis{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ-dG monofunctional adduct were examined.
Transcription levels were determined after 24, 48, and
72 hours (Supplementary Fig. S8). The transcription inhibition effects of the cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct were the
same as those of a cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link in
both HEC59 and HEC59þChr2 cells. There was a small
increase in transcription inhibition by pyriplatin in HEC59þ
Chr2 cells. The transcription levels in the presence of a cis-{Pt

HEC59 cells and 65%, 76%, and 89% in HEC59þChr2 cells at
24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Discussion
Transcription inhibition is one of the major consequences of
platinum–DNA damage, and there is a correlation between
transcription inhibition by platinum compounds and their
efﬁcacy as anticancer agents (23, 24). Numerous reports have
presented the transcription inhibition of bifunctional platinum
antitumor compounds through reconstituted systems or studies in cell extracts or culture. Different mechanisms of transcription inhibition have been proposed, including hijacking of
transcription factors, physical blocking of RNA polymerases,
and disruption of chromatin structure (24). Knowledge of
transcription inhibition at monofunctional platinum–DNA
adducts in the cell is, however, very limited. Monofunctional
adducts at guanine residues formed by cis-[PtCl(NH3)2(N7ACV) [ACV, acyclovir or 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine],
an active antiviral and antitumor compound, terminate
DNA and RNA synthesis in vitro (25, 26). Other monofunctional platinum(II) compounds, such as [PtCl(dien)]Cl and
[Pt(NH3)3Cl]Cl, or monofunctional adducts of cisplatin, were
unable to inhibit RNA (27–29) or DNA (5) polymerase activity
in vitro. Pyriplatin effectively blocked RNA synthesis in vitro,
and a detailed mechanism of how this monofunctional plat-

inum antineoplastic compound can inhibit pol II has been put
forth (13). This study signiﬁcantly extends our knowledge of
transcription inhibition by monofunctional platinum anticancer agents to live mammalian cells and provides important
information about which repair pathways remove monofunctional Pt–DNA adducts.
Transcription inhibition of pyriplatin in NER-deﬁcient
cells
NER is considered the major pathway for removing cisplatin–DNA 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-links (3, 30, 31).
There are 2 subpathways in NER, namely, transcriptioncoupled NER (TC-NER) and global genome NER. TC-NER–
deﬁcient cells are hypersensitive to cisplatin, indicating its
critical role in the platinum–DNA damage response (30). The
transcription inhibition proﬁle of a reporter gene containing
global cisplatin cross-links, or a site-speciﬁc cisplatin crosslink, is dramatically different in XPF and XPFcorr cells (17).
Here, we studied the transcription inhibition proﬁles of
oxaliplatin and pyriplatin in NER-deﬁcient cells including
XPF cells. Transcription of a globally pyriplatin-damaged
reporter gene recovers slightly over 44 hours, and greater
transcription inhibition occurs in XPF cells, indicating a role
of NER in the repair of pyriplatin–DNA damage. Compared
with the transcription inhibition of cisplatin in XPF and
XPFcorr cells that we reported previously (17), however,
pyriplatin does not evoke signiﬁcant transcription recovery
with time when globally platinated plasmids were used,
indicating that pyriplatin–dG adducts are more difﬁcult for
the cellular machinery to recognize and repair. We also
incorporated pyriplatin site speciﬁcally into the pGLuc
plasmid between the CMV promoter and the GLuc

expression gene to evaluate whether a pyriplatin–DNA
adduct can act as a roadblock to the transcribing pol II
complex in live cells. Robust transcription inhibition by a
single pyriplatin–dG adduct was observed in XPF cells.
Restoration of the XPF function signiﬁcantly restored the
transcription levels of luciferase from a plasmid site-speciﬁcally modiﬁed with pyriplatin. Identical results were
obtained from plasmids globally platinated with pyriplatin
in XPF-knockdown cells, strongly supporting our conclusion that NER plays a key role in the repair of pyriplatin–
DNA damage. Moreover, pyriplatin inhibited transcription
as effectively as oxaliplatin in U2OS cells, despite their
NER-deﬁcient status.
Transcription inhibition of platinum compounds in
MMR-deﬁcient cells
MMR corrects single base mismatches and looped intermediates generated from DNA polymerase slippage during
replication and recombination, as well as some forms of DNA
damage by endogenous or exogenous toxicants (32). DNA mismatches are recognized by hMutSa, a heterodimer of hMSH2
and hMSH6, and hMutSb, a heterodimer of hMSH2 and
hMSH3. The binding of MMR proteins to different types of
platinum–DNA adducts has been studied in vitro. hMSH2
binds with some speciﬁcity to DNA globally damaged by
cisplatin, and hMutSa recognizes cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) but not
1,3-d(GpTpG) cross-links (33–35). Cell-based studies revealed
that MMR-deﬁciency is correlated with cisplatin resistance
(36, 37). This line of evidence, together with other ﬁndings,
implies that, in addition to the role of MMR in platinum damage
repair, MMR proteins bind to cisplatin–DNA damage and
initiate a signal transduction pathway leading to cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis (38).
We examined endometrial HEC59 (hMSH2 deﬁcient) and
HEC59þChr2 (hMSH2 proﬁcient) adenocarcinoma cells to
investigate the transcription inhibition of pyriplatin as well
as the potential role of MMR in the repair or processing
cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and pyriplatin lesions. Transcription
assays with globally platinated plasmids indicated the inhibitory effects of cisplatin and pyriplatin to be greater in
hMSH2-proﬁcient cells. When D0 values are considered,
pyriplatin is as active as cisplatin in inhibiting transcription
of a reporter gene, and oxaliplatin is the most active compound in these cells. Platinum–DNA adducts from cisplatin
and pyriplatin are slightly better transcription inhibitors in
hMSH2-proﬁcient cells, and no signiﬁcant difference was
observed between hMSH2-deﬁcient and hMSH2-proﬁcient
cells when oxaliplatin plasmids were employed (Supplementary Table S3). These results further show that MMR may
play a role, albeit a minor one, in mediating the cytotoxicity
of cisplatin and pyriplatin. The results are in agreement with
a previous model in which MMR proteins bind to cisplatin–
DNA cross-links but not those from oxaliplatin (39). When
site-speciﬁcally platinated plasmids were used, there were
identical transcription inhibition effects for a cisplatin 1,2-d
(GpG) cross-link in hMSH2-deﬁcient and hMSH2-proﬁcient
cells. A cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct, which is as active as
a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link in blocking RNA synthesis,

www.aacrjournals.org

had a moderately stronger transcription inhibition effect in
hMSH2-proﬁcient cells. Taken together, these results suggest that MMR, instead of being the major repair pathway for
removing pyriplatin–DNA adducts, may play a role in initiating apoptosis signaling pathways in response to pyriplatin–DNA damage.
Transcription inhibition of platinum compounds in
PARP-1-knockdown cells
PARP-1 is one of the most abundant nuclear proteins in
eukaryotes. The cellular functions of PARP-1 include modulation of chromatin structure and transcription, as well as
DNA repair housekeeping (40). When genomic DNA is mildly
damaged, PARP-1 is fully activated to recruit repair machinery and signal downstream effectors (41, 42). PARP-1 mainly
detects single-strand breaks (SSB), obligatory intermediates
in base excision repair (BER) and NER. PARP-1 thus participates actively in BER, and there is accumulating evidence
for a role in NER (43). The afﬁnity of PARP-1 for cisplatindamaged DNA has been established by photocross-linking
studies, and in vitro binding assays further revealed the
binding of PARP-1 to DNA damaged by cisplatin, oxaliplatin,
and pyriplatin (44–47). The transcription inhibition effects
of pyriplatin in PARP-1 knockdown cells and the question of
whether or not PARP-1 has a signiﬁcant function in the
repair of pyriplatin–DNA adducts in live cells have never
been explored until now.
To investigate these possibilities, we used PARP-1–knockdown MEFS to reveal the transcription inhibition proﬁle of
pyriplatin and the possible role of PARP-1 in repairing pyriplatin–DNA adducts. Our results from globally platinated
plasmids show that pyriplatin has identical D0 values compared with cisplatin and oxaliplatin; thus pyriplatin, once it
binds to DNA, inhibits transcription as efﬁciently as these U.S.
Food and Drug Administration–approved platinum drugs.
Cisplatin and oxaliplatin display greater transcription inhibition in PARP-1/ cells at both high and low numbers of
platinum adducts on the plasmids, implying a role for PARP-1
in repair of cisplatin- or oxaliplatin-damaged DNA (Supplementary Fig. S9). When plasmids globally platinated with
pyriplatin were examined, transcription inhibition levels were
not notably different for PARP-1 normal versus knockdown
cells, especially at 12.5 and 23.2 Pt/DNA (Supplementary
Fig. S10), suggesting that SSBR may not be a determinative
repair pathway in response to pyriplatin damage. We also
used site-speciﬁcally platinated plasmids in this reporter
assay. Transcription inhibition effects were slightly lower
in the PARP-1 knockdown cells for plasmids containing
a site-speciﬁc cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link or a
cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct (Supplementary Fig. S11).
Nevertheless, the transcription inhibition effects of the monofunctional platinum dG adduct are as strong as those of the
bifunctional platinum 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link. One explanation
for the difference between the results from globally and sitespeciﬁcally platinated plasmids is that PARP-1 is not fully
activated by a single platinum present on the plasmid. The
protein may still bind to the adduct, however, possibly shielding the damage from repair. Such an outcome would result in

results from globally and site-speciﬁcally platinated plasmids
suggest that SSBR is not the major repair pathway to remove

clinical studies for possible development as next generation
platinum anticancer drugs.

Implications for the mechanism of action of cisplatin
and suggestions for improvement of monofunctional
platinum anticancer agents
The mechanism of cisplatin action is a multistep process
including cell entry, activation, DNA binding, and subsequent
cellular responses (2, 3). Cisplatin is transported across the
plasma membrane by both passive diffusion and carrier-mediated active transport. Once cisplatin enters cells, the relatively
low chloride ion concentration of the cytosol favors the formation of activated aquated species. This active form of
cisplatin subsequently attacks nucleophilic centers such as
DNA bases, which are mainly responsible for the cytotoxicity of
the drug. Cisplatin can also bind other molecules such as
glutathione or metallothionein, processes that deactivate the
compound. Formation of the platinum–DNA cross-links
induces a complex series of cellular responses, including
transcription inhibition, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis.
Remarkably, the monofunctional compound pyriplatin seems
to have a mechanism of action very similar if not identical to
that of cisplatin. This commonality of mechanism, despite
dramatically different structures for the Pt–DNA adducts,
provides support for the current consensus mechanism of the
platinum anticancer drugs (1).
Previous reports reveal that pyriplatin is an excellent substrate for organic cation transporters (OCT; ref. 12) but that the
potency of pyriplatin is lower than that of cisplatin against
ovarian, breast, and a variety of other types of cancer cells (11).
From the present results, we conclude that pyriplatin binds to
DNA in cancer cells as efﬁciently as cisplatin. Pyriplatin, once
bound to DNA, inhibits transcription as strongly as cisplatin,
and pyriplatin–DNA adducts are more difﬁcult to remove by
the cellular repair machinery. NER is mainly responsible for
removal of pyriplatin–DNA adducts.
Because pyriplatin and cisplatin share similar DNA binding,
transcription inhibition, and repair pathways, we propose 3
possible reasons to account for the lower cytotoxicity of
pyriplatin compared with cisplatin. First, the cell may not
accumulate pyriplatin as well as cisplatin. Although taken up
by OCTs, pyriplatin may not pass as readily into the cytoplasm
and nucleus of the cell. Second, pyriplatin may be deactivated
more readily prior to DNA binding. Third, transcription inhibition by pyriplatin may not correlate with its cytotoxicity,
which we believe to be unlikely in mammalian systems. This
analysis, combined with previous results on the structures of
site-speciﬁcally modiﬁed DNA, including a transcription complex with pol II, has guided the rational design of signiﬁcantly
more potent monofunctional platinum anticancer agents (12,
13). In particular, as will be described elsewhere, monofunctional cationic platinum complexes bearing more extended
aromatic fused ring heterocyclic ligands than pyridine have
recently been obtained that signiﬁcantly exceed the level of
cisplatin cytotoxicity (G.Y. Park and S.J. Lippard, unpublished
data). Such compounds are currently being evaluated in pre-

In these studies, we established transcription inhibition
proﬁles for pyriplatin–DNA adducts in NER-, MMR- and
SSBR-deﬁcient cells as well as in the corresponding repairproﬁcient cells. Gaussia luciferase reporters were used to
measure the effects of pyriplatin modiﬁcation of DNA, and
plasmid-based reporter assays allowed us to examine transcription inhibition by pyriplatin and the DNA repair capacity in live cells. Pyriplatin reacts with plasmid DNA as
efﬁciently as cisplatin and signiﬁcantly more so than oxaliplatin. It inhibits transcription in live cells to the same
extent as cisplatin when globally platinated plasmids were
used. A single, site-speciﬁc cis-{Pt(NH3)2(py)}2þ–dG adduct
within the 3,986-bp plasmid dramatically inhibits transcription, at least as strongly as a cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ 1,2-d(GpG)
cross-link. NER, rather than MMR or SSBR, plays the most
important role in removing pyriplatin–DNA adducts. We
provide the ﬁrst evidence that a monofunctional platinum
anticancer agent can block RNA synthesis as efﬁciently as
traditional bifunctional platinum anticancer drugs in live
mammalian cells, and our data suggest that the repair
mechanism of the monofunctional platinum compounds
might be similar to that of bifunctional platinum compounds. Our ﬁndings support a role for monofunctional
platinum anticancer agents in cancer chemotherapy.
Because pyriplatin can react with DNA to a level similar to
that of cisplatin and, when bound to DNA, inhibit transcription as effectively as cisplatin, monofunctional platinum
compounds with improved cellular uptake and reduced
ability to bind cellular targets not associated with cytotoxicity may prove to be a promising route to novel platinumbased therapies.
