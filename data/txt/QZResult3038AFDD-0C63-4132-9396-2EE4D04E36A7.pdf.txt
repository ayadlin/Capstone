ABSTRACT
Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 5 protein (TM4SF5) is presumed to serve
as a molecular target to prevent or treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon
cancer in a mouse model. Previously, we reported the efficacy of anti-cancer peptide
vaccine targeting TM4SF5. In addition, we reported an anti-proliferative effect of antiTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody in HCC. Here, we investigated expression of TM4SF5
in 45 primary colon cancer tissues. Almost all of the colon cancer tissues expressed
TM4SF5 based on immunohistochemistry using anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody. The
treatment of human colon cancer cells with anti-TM4SF5 antibody reduced growth of
TM4SF5 expressing cells and enhanced expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin. Using
mouse colon cancer models, we then evaluated the in vivo anti-cancer effect of antiTM4SF5 antibody. Injection of the antibody significantly reduced growth of tumors
priorly established by subcutaneous injection of human colon cancer cells HT-29 in a
xenograft setting. We obtained similar results with mouse colon cancer cell line CT-26
in an allograft setting. Therefore, we suggest that the TM4SF5-specific monoclonal
antibody has a therapeutic effect against colon cancer.

INTRODUCTION

whole tumor cell vaccines, viral vector-based cancer
vaccines, adoptive cell transfer therapy, antibody-based
cancer immunotherapy, and cytokine therapy are another
treatment option [6]. Immunotherapy has gained attention
as the therapeutics has narrow specificity and therefore
may have fewer side effects [7-10].
Understanding the receptor-mediated signaling
pathways involved in cancer development is important
for designing cancer-specific therapeutics targeting
extracellular molecules. Several well-known oncogenic
pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
cancers, including the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF/c-Met),

Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers
in the world. It has high mortality, about 30% ~ 40%
in the United States and Europe, and is more common
in developed countries than in undeveloped countries
[1]. As the number of deaths from colon cancer is
increasing worldwide, prevention, early diagnosis, and
efficacious therapy are critically important [2]. Surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are generally performed,
alone or in combination, to treat patients with colon
cancer [3-5]. Immunotherapeutic approaches using
peptide vaccines, dendritic cell-based cancer vaccines,

and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways
[11-15]. Mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes involved in these receptor signaling pathways are
commonly observed in several cancers including colon
cancer [15,16].
In the past decade, small molecule inhibitors and
antibodies targeting these receptors have been widely
investigated in both preclinical and clinical applications to
block the pathogenesis of cancers [17-21]. Bevacizumab
(Avastin) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal
antibody against VEGF that has proven to be effective for
the treatment of colon cancer, renal cancer, ovarian cancer,
etc. [19-21]. Other neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
against EGFR (cetuximab and panitumumab) have been
approved as therapeutics for colon cancer [22,23].
Tetraspanins, also known as transmembrane
4 superfamily (TM4SF) members, can associate
with various molecules such as integrins, membrane
receptors, immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, and
other tetraspanins to form a multimolecular tetraspanin
web [24,25]. Because of the great heterogeneity in the
composition of the web, tetraspanins are widely involved
in regulation of cell differentiation, activation, growth,
and migration [26-30]. Recent reports revealed that
tetraspanins function as both suppressors and promoters
of metastasis depending on the particular tetraspanins
[31]. Tetraspanins have thus gained attention as diagnostic
and prognostic markers, as well as therapeutic targets for
preventing tumor progression [31,32].
TM4SF5, one of the tetraspanins, was previously
implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [33,34].
TM4SF5 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, loss of contact inhibition, and regulation
of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis through cooperation
with integrins [34,35]. TM4SF5 expression enhanced
migration and invasion, which may contribute to effective
metastasis [36]. Previously, we established a method to
induce production of antibodies using peptide epitopes in
combination with CpG-DNA-liposome complex without
carriers [37]. Using this technology, we showed that
TM4SF5 can serve as a molecular target for HCC and
colon cancer: a peptide vaccine targeting TM4SF5 had
preventive or therapeutic effects against HCC and colon
cancer in mouse models [38-41]. Therefore, we postulated
that TM4SF5-specific monoclonal antibody can serve
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as a therapeutic antibody to treat these cancers and we
recently proved that injection of anti-TM4SF5 antibody
can suppress the growth of HCC tumor in a mouse model
[42].
In this study, we investigated expression of TM4SF5
in colon cancer tissues and the therapeutic effect of the
TM4SF5-specific monoclonal antibody against colon
cancer in a mouse model. We confirmed that injection
of anti-TM4SF5 antibody reduced the growth of tumors
derived from pre-implanted colon cancer cells in mice.

RESULTS
Expression of the TM4SF5 protein in human
colon cancer tissues
In order to investigate expression of the
TM4SF5 protein in colon cancer tissues, we performed
immunohistochemical staining with the anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody. We analyzed 45 samples of primary
colon cancer tissues along with normal colon tissue
samples as a control (tissue microarray A203VII). As
shown in Figure 1A, there was no expression of TM4SF5
in normal colon tissues. However, almost all of the colon
cancer tissues (44 among 45 samples) expressed TM4SF5
(97.8%, staining in >11% of tumor cells) (Figure 1B,
Table 1). Approximately 35.6% of colon cancer tissue
samples expressed TM4SF5 in ≥75% of tumor cells and
~40% of colon cancer tissues were positive for TM4SF5
expression in 74-50% of tumor cells. It is thus concluded
that expression of TM4SF5 can serve as a marker of colon
cancer. However, the levels of TM4SF5 expression did not
correlate with colon tumor grade or stage (Table 2).

Expression of TM4SF5 in human colon cancer cell
lines and the effect of anti-TM4SF5 antibody on
the growth of TM4SF5 expressing cells
To validate TM4SF5 as an efficacious target
for anti-colon cancer therapy, we first examined the
expression of TM4SF5 mRNA in human colon cancer
cell lines. As shown in Figure 2A, HT-29 and LoVo cells

expressed human TM4SF5 mRNA, but HCT116 did not
express TM4SF5. Therefore, these cell lines can be used
as a model. Expression of TM4SF5 was also detected in a
mouse colon cancer cell line CT-26, as previously reported
[40], and therefore CT-26 cells were used for a mouse
allograft model.
We then investigated the effect of the anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody on colon cancer cell growth. The

growth of HT-29 cells and LoVo cells expressing TM4SF5
was delayed by the antibody treatment. However, there
was no change with control IgG treatment. In contrast,
anti-TM4SF5 antibody did not induce a significant change
in the growth of HCT116 cells, which did not express
TM4SF5 (Figure 2B). Therefore, we conclude that the
anti-TM4SF5 antibody has an anti-proliferative effect on
human colon cancer cells expressing TM4SF5 in vitro.

Effect of the anti-hTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
on the expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin in
human colon cancer cells

Figures 3A and 3B, treatment of HT-29 cells with the antiTM4SF5 antibody enhanced expression of E-cadherin
compared to the untreated control or IgG-treated control.
In contrast, there was no prominent difference in HCT116
cells.
In addition to E-cadherin, β-catenin is an essential
component of the cell adhesion complex [43]. We
therefore also investigated expression of β-catenin (Figure
4). Treatment of HT-29 cells with anti-TM4SF5 antibody
clearly enhanced expression of β-catenin. However, there
was no difference in the untreated control or IgG-treated

E-cadherin is a major protein involved in cell-cell
interaction. Previously, we found that treatment of HCC
cells expressing TM4SF5 with anti-TM4SF5 antibody
enhances expression of E-cadherin [42]. We therefore
checked expression of E-cadherin using confocal
microscopy and Western blotting analysis. As shown in

Figure 3: Enhanced expression of E-cadherin in TM4SF5 expressing cells after treatment with anti-TM4SF5 antibody.

A. The expression levels of E-cadherin in the colon cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT116 cells, were analyzed by confocal microscopy after
treatment with PBS, normal IgG, or the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody for 3 days. The secondary antibody control without the anti-Ecaherin antibody staining is shown as (-) E cadherin. B. (Top) The expression levels of E-cadherin in the colon cancer cells were analyzed
by Western blotting. The expression levels of GAPDH are shown as a loading control. These are representative of at least three independent
experiments. (Bottom) The band intensity was measured using Photoshop CS6 and normalized with the amount of GAPDH control.

control. Treatment of HCT116 cells with anti-TM4SF5
antibody induced no change. These results suggest that
enhanced cell-cell interaction induced by treatment with
TM4SF5 antibody contributes to contact inhibition in
TM4SF5 expressing cells.
We previously showed that the anti-TM4SF5
antibody induced changes in actin polymerization and
formation of focal adhesion sites in HCC cells based on
phalloidin and paxillin staining [42]. However, we found
that there was no change in colon cancer cells (data not
shown). Other changes observed in TM4SF5 expressing
HCC cells treated with anti-TM4SF5 antibody were
nuclear translocation of the CDK inhibitor p27kip1 and
increased activity of a small GTP protein RhoA [42].
Therefore, we checked these aspects and found that antiTM4SF5 did not induce a prominent change in colon

cancer cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that
the specific action mechanism of anti-TM4SF5 differs
depending on the specific types of tissue expressing
TM4SF5.

Localization of the injected anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody on colon tumors in vivo
As the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody can
inhibit the growth of colon cancer cell lines in vitro,
we next investigated the in vivo effect of the antibody
on tumors. First, we determined the distribution of the
anti-TM4SF5 antibody after injection into mice. The
anti-TM4SF5 antibody and mouse IgG2a control were
conjugated with DyLight 755 (a fluorescent dye) and

CT-26 cell derived tumors. After 72 h, the distribution of
the labeled antibody was quantified by measuring the total
photon flux (photons/sec) of the fluorescence. As shown in
Figures 5A and 5B, the DyLight 755-labeled anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody was localized in the tumors, whereas

the DyLight 755-labeled IgG2a control was not detected in
the mice. When we cut out the tumor mass and analyzed
microsections of the frozen tissue, we found that many of
the tumor cells were stained with the DyLight 755-labeled
anti-TM4SF5 antibody (Figure 5C). In contrast, we
could not detect any labeling in the control sections
obtained from mice injected with DyLight 755-labeled

of colon tumors compared with PBS or normal mouse
IgG (Figures 6A-C). The antibody treatment did not
affect the body weight during the experiment (Figure
6D). The expression of TM4SF5 in colon tumor tissue
was confirmed by immunostaining with the anti-TM4SF5
antibody (Figure 6E). Analysis of the results of xenograft
experiments revealed that the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody targeting colon tumor cells can decrease tumor
growth in vivo.

treatment with anti-TM4SF5 antibody restores contact
inhibition, resulting in reduced cell growth. However,
some mechanisms of action induced by anti-TM4SF5
antibody in colon cancer appear to be different from HCC.
For example, nuclear localization of p27kip1 was detected
in HCC cells treated with the anti-TM4SF5 antibody;
however a prominent difference after treatment of colon
cancer cells with anti-TM4SF5 antibody was not observed.
Considering a previous report that p27kip1 alterations such
as cytoplasmic  p27kip1  localization  or  p27kip1 loss are
associated with superior prognosis of colon cancer patients
[44], functional recovery of p27kip1 in the nucleus may not
be a viable target of anti-tumor activities in colon cancer.
Nonetheless, we can conclude that the anti-TM4SF5
antibody may have therapeutic effects on colon cancer.
We therefore validated anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody as an efficacious therapeutic against colon cancer
in vivo using mouse xenograft and allograft models. To
confirm the anti-tumor activity of the anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody against colon cancer in vivo, we
administered the anti-TM4SF5 antibody into mice bearing
tumors pre-established by injection with human or mouse
colon cancer cells. The anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
was specifically localized in the tumor tissues (Figure
5) and significantly suppressed tumor growth without
prominent side effects (Figures 6 and 7). The obtained
results demonstrate that this anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody has therapeutic effects in mouse models of colon
cancer, and suggest that injection with anti-TM4SF5
antibody can be an efficacious therapeutics to treat colon
cancer in humans.
Considering that TM4SF5 expression was detected
also in pancreatic cancer tissues [33,42], we can extend the
present research to investigate the expression of TM4SF5
protein in a number of pancreatic cancer tissues and
evaluate the efficacy of the anti-TM4SF5 antibody as a
therapeutic in a mouse model. Through such research, we
can validate the strategy described here to treat pancreatic
cancer in the future. As pancreatic cancer is notoriously
difficult to treat, the outcome of such research would
provide valuable information. Recently, high expression
of TM4SF5 in esophageal cancer tissues was reported: a
high level of TM4SF5 expression was detected in about
45% of evaluated cases and high TM4SF5 expression
was associated with cancer progression and poor patient
survival [45]. It is thus possible that anti-TM4SF5
antibody also has anti-cancer effects on esophageal cancer.
To strengthen the anti-cancer effects of the targeted
therapy using the anti-TM4SF5 antibody, development
of an antibody-drug conjugate may be a better choice,
as previously reported [46,47]. For rational and safer
antibody therapeutics, tremendous efforts to understand
the action mechanism, produce humanized antibodies,
and validate in vivo effects of the antibodies in detail are
warranted.

Anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody inhibits colon
cancer growth in an allograft mouse model
To investigate the effect of anti-TM4SF5 antibody
on colon tumors, we used mouse CT-26 cells and a
mouse tumor allograft model. As shown in Figures 7AC, treatment with the anti-TM4SF5 antibody significantly
suppressed the progression of colon tumors derived from
CT-26 cells. The antibody treatment did not affect the body
weight during the experiment (Figure 7D). Together these
experiments suggest that the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal
antibody can inhibit growth of colon tumors in an allograft
mouse model.

DISCUSSION
It has been reported that TM4SF5 mRNA is
expressed in colon carcinoma, pancreatic tumors, and
HCC [33]. We recently investigated the expression of the
TM4SF5 protein in human HCC specimens using the antiTM4SF5 monoclonal antibody and found that TM4SF5
protein was expressed in all of the 105 HCC tissues
examined [42]. In addition to HCC, TM4SF5 expression
was also detected in colon cancer and pancreatic cancer
tissues [42]. Here, we investigated expression of the
TM4SF5 protein in colon cancer tissues in detail and
confirmed that the TM4SF5 protein is overexpressed in
human colon cancer tissues. In addition, we investigated
in vitro and in vivo effects of anti-TM4SF5 antibody using
colon cancer cell lines and mouse models.
This is the first report directly showing expression
of TM4SF5 protein in a large number of colon cancer
tissues. Based on the immunohistochemistry data of
colon cancer tissue microarrays, TM4SF5 expression was
detected in almost all of the colon cancer tissue samples
we examined, at various expression levels (Table 1). The
expression of TM4SF5 in some colon cancer cell lines was
also examined. Expression of TM4SF5 is thus likely to be
associated with onset or progression of colon cancer cells
and TM4SF5 can be a target to treat colon cancer.
We also confirmed that the anti-TM4SF5 antibody
inhibited growth of human colon cancer cell lines
expressing TM4SF5. Furthermore, we found that the
expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin was enhanced
by anti-TM4SF5 antibody. These results suggest that

other cell lines were maintained in an RPMI 1640 medium
with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
100 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37oC in an
incubator containing 5% CO2.

Production of the mouse anti-human TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody
As described previously [37], we obtained
hybridoma cells producing the anti-hTM4SF5 peptidespecific monoclonal antibody after immunization of
BALB/c mice with the hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide derived
from human TM4SF5 (138NRTLWDRCEAPPRV151) and
CpG-DNA coencapsulated in a DOPE:CHEMS complex.
The anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody was purified from
the ascitic fluid by protein A column chromatography.
As the isotype of anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody is
IgG2a, the real control is normal IgG2a. However, we
previously confirmed that normal IgG can be used as a
control instead of IgG2a [42]. Therefore, we used normal
IgG or IgG2a as an antibody control for in vitro and in
vivo experiments.

To analyze the TM4SF5 expression, we performed
RT-PCR. Total RNAs were extracted with an RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen), and the cDNA was synthesized as described
previously [38]. The standard PCR reaction was performed
for 25 cycles with the following primer sets: mouse
GAPDH,
5’-ATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACG-3’
and 5’-GTTGTCATGGATGATCTTGGCC-3’ (501 bp);
mouse TM4SF5, 5’-CGCTTACTTGCGAAATGACA-3’
and 5’-TTTCCTGCAATCGCCACACA-3’ (174 bp),
human β-actin, 5’-GGGTCAGAAGGATTCCTATG-3’
and 5’-CCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTT-3’ (500 bp);
human TM4SF5, 5’-AGCTTGCAAGTCTGGCTCAT-3’
and 5’-GCTGGATCCCACACAGTACT-3’ (408 bp).

Tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry
For the colon cancer tissue analysis, formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded AccuMax tissue arrays were purchased
from ISUABXIS with the approval of the Institutional
Review Board in Hallym University. The colon cancer
tissue array (A203VII) is composed of 45 cases of colon
cancer tissues in duplicate and 8 normal colon tissues. The
slides were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated in
ethanol, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked
with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. For antigen
retrieval, all sections were boiled in a citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) (ScyTek Laboratories) for 15 min. The slides
were incubated overnight in PBST (PBS, Tween 0.2%)
containing the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody (10
µg/ml) at 4°C, followed by incubation with biotinylated
anti-mouse IgG antibody (Histostain Plus kit, Invitrogen).
They were sequentially reacted with streptavidinconjugated peroxidase, 3’,3’-diaminobenzinidine (0.5 mg/
ml) and hydrogen peroxide and then counterstained with
hematoxylin. After rinsing, the sections were mounted,
dehydrated, and covered with cover slips. All images were
examined using a Nikon Eclipse E-200 microscope. The
percentages of cells expressing TM4SF5 were calculated
as the number of TM4SF5-positive cells divided by the
total number of cells in each tumor type.

MTT assay
To evaluate the effect of the antibody on the growth
of cells, an MTT assay was performed as described
previously [48, 49]. Cells were treated with PBS, normal
IgG, or anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody (10 µg/ml) for
up to 5 days. The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Sigma-Aldrich) solution
was added to each well and then the plates were incubated
for 4 h at 37oC. The medium was removed, and the
formazan crystals were solubilized in DMSO. The color
development was measured using a spectrophotometer at
595 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm.

Confocal microscopy
Cells were cultured on glass cover slips in 4-well
plates 18 h prior to treatment with the anti-hTM4SF5
monoclonal antibody or control IgG (10 µg/ml). After
treatment with the antibody for the indicated time
periods, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100,
and stained with the anti-E-cadherin antibody (rabbit
polyclonal Ab, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7870)
or with anti-β-catenin antibody (rabbit polyclonal Ab,
Upstate Biotechnology, #06-734), for 1 h. After extensive
washing in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the
samples were incubated with Alexa Flour 488 or Alexa
Flour 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) for
1 h. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258, and the

Cell culture
The human colon cancer cell lines HT-29, LoVo,
and HCT116, and the mouse colon cancer cell line CT-26
were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank. CT-26
cells were maintained in a DMEM medium containing

mounted samples were scanned with an LSM 710 (Carl
Zeiss).

5x106 CT-26 cells in 50% Matrigel as previously described
[40]. When tumors reached 5 mm in diameter, the mice
were randomly divided into three treatment groups (8
mice/group): PBS, IgG control, and the anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody. The antibodies (25 mg/kg) were
injected twice weekly into the intraperitoneal cavity.
Tumor diameters were measured using calipers at 2 day
intervals for 18 days following the injection of CT-26 cells,
and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula
width2 × length/2. Finally, the mice were sacrificed 18
days after CT-26 cells injection and the tumors were
weighed. For the xenograft assays, thirty BALB/cAnCrjnu/nu mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the dorsal
right flank with 5x106 HT-29 cells containing 50%
Matrigel. When tumors reached 5 mm in diameter, the
mice were randomly divided into three treatment groups
(8 mice/group): PBS, IgG control, and the anti-TM4SF5
monoclonal antibody. Six mice injected with neither
cancer cells nor antibody were used as a control. The
antibodies (25 mg/kg) were injected twice weekly into the
intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor diameters were measured
using calipers at 5 day intervals for 25 days following
the injection of HT-29 cells, and tumor volumes were
calculated using the formula width2 × length/2. Finally, the
mice were sacrificed 30 days after HT-29 cells injection
and the tumors were weighed.

Western blotting
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Pall Corporation).
The membranes were incubated with primary antibody
for 2 h, washed with PBST, and incubated in HRPconjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were
developed using ECL reagents (Intron Biotechnology).

Biodistribution imaging in vivo
5 mg/ml of the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
and IgG2a control (Bethyl Laboratories) in PBS solution
was adjusted to contain 50 mM borate buffer (pH 8.5). The
antibodies were conjugated with DyLight 755 and purified
using a DyLight 755 Antibody Labeling Kit (Thermo
Scientific). Fifty micrograms of DyLight 755-labeled
anti-TM4SF5 antibody or DyLight 755-labeled IgG2a
control were injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of
BALB/c control mice or mice bearing CT-26 cell derived
tumors. The distribution of the DyLight 755-labeled
antibodies was quantified by in vivo fluorescence using
a real-time IVIS imaging system 200 (Xenogen Corp.).
To investigate the localization of the injected DyLight
755-labeled antibodies in colon tumor tissues, the tissues
were removed at 72 h. The frozen tissues were cut into
4-µm-thick slices using a cryostat and stained with
SYTOX Green dye for nuclei, and the mounted samples
were examined with an LSM 710.

Histology and immunohistochemistry
The tumors were removed and fixed in a 4%
buffered formalin solution overnight, embedded in
paraffin using standard methods, and cut into 5-µmthick sections. The sections were deparaffinized and then
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). To evaluate
the expression of TM4SF5, the deparaffinized sections
were stained with the anti-TM4SF5 monoclonal antibody
(10 µg/ml), according to standard procedures using a
Histostain Plus kit. The samples were then counterstained
with hematoxylin. All images were examined using a
Nikon Eclipse E-200 microscope.

Animals
Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions in the Experimental Animal Center of Hallym
University. Four-week-old male BALB/cAnCrj-nu/nu
mice and BALB/c mice were purchased from OrientBio.
Our animal studies were performed according to the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Veterinary Research
& Quarantine Service of Korea. All procedures involving
animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Hallym University (Permit
Number: Hallym 2011-89, Hallym 2012-81-1). The mice
were sacrificed under Zoletil 50+Rompun anesthesia with
all efforts to minimize suffering.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean + standard deviation.
Statistical significance between two samples was evaluated
using the Student’s t test. A p-value of <0.05 was taken as
statistically significant.
