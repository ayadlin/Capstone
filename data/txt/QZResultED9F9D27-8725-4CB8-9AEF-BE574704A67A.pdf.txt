BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to elicit future patients’ preferences for preoperative chemoradiation
(pre-CRT) for rectal cancer to determine whether patients’ preferences are consistent with current treatment guidelines. METHODS: During a standardized interview, the treatment protocol, risks, benefits, and long-term outcomes
associated with 1) surgery alone (SA) and 2) pre-CRT followed by surgery (CR þ S) were described to healthy individuals, and a threshold task was performed. Each participant was asked which treatment option they would prefer
when the risk of local recurrence was set initially at 15% for both options. If the participant indicated SA (which was
expected), then the risk of local recurrence for CR þ S was lowered systematically until the participant’s preference
changed from SA to CR þ S. This threshold point represented the risk of local recurrence for pre-CRT that the participant would require before they would choose treatment with pre-CRT. RESULTS: Fifty individuals participated in the
study, and the majority were well educated. Twenty-seven of 50 participants (54%) required a risk of local recurrence
with CR þ S of 5% (ie, equivalent to an absolute risk reduction 10%) before they would choose treatment with
pre-CRT. Regression analysis did not identify any variables that were predictive of the participants’ preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants seemed to highly value functional outcomes and seemed willing to accept a higher risk
of local recurrence to achieve this. Therefore, developers of future guidelines may need to downgrade the use of

Although it has been demonstrated that preoperative radiation therapy (pre-RT) and preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pre-CRT) significantly decrease the risk of local recurrence after surgery for rectal cancer, these treatment protocols do
not affect survival and lead to poorer functional outcomes (ie, bowel and sexual function) compared with surgery alone1-7
(Table 1). Therefore, treatment decision making for pre-RT and pre-CRT is challenging because of the inherent tradeoffs
between oncologic outcome in terms of local recurrence and functional outcomes in terms of bowel and sexual function.
More recently, studies from North America and Europe have reported improved outcomes for patients with intermediate-risk tumors.8,9 On the basis of this evidence, experts in North America have suggested that a more selective
approach to the use of pre-CRT likely is indicated.10-12 Gunderson et al pooled the results from 5 North American
randomized controlled trials (n ¼ 3971 patients) and observed that the 5-year disease-free survival and local recurrence
rates for patients who had T2N1 and T3N0 or intermediate-risk tumors were not only similar but had improved outcomes relative to patients who had T2N2 and T3N1 or higher risk tumors9 (Table 2). Merkel et al analyzed the data from

853 patients with rectal cancer from a population-based
cancer registry and demonstrated that the survival and
local recurrence rates were similar for T2 tumors and T3a
tumors (ie, <5 mm extramural depth of invasion). In
addition, the outcomes for these patients with T2 and
T3a tumors were better relative to the outcomes of
patients with T3b, T3c, T3d (ie, >5 mm extramural
depth of invasion), and T4 tumors8 (Table 3). Based on
these studies, a more selective approach to the choice of
pre-CRT is used in the United Kingdom in which
patients who have T3 tumors with <5 mm of extramural
depth of invasion with either N0 or N1 lymph node status
proceed directly to surgery provided the circumferential
resection margin is not threatened.13-16
Furthermore, it seems that physicians are not the
only group supportive of a more selective approach to the
use of pre-CRT. In a recent survey of 152 lay individuals,
86% (range, 73%-93%) chose not to receive neoadjuvant
therapy when they were provided with the specific outcomes from each of 5 randomized controlled trials that

assessed the effectiveness of pre-CRT and pre-RT.1,5,17-20
Furthermore, although the participants were aware of the
10% survival difference demonstrated in the Swedish
trial, only 24% chose to receive pre-RT.
Despite these issues, guidelines published in both the
United States and Canada recommend pre-CRT for all
patients with stage II and stage III rectal cancer and fail
to incorporate the patients’ treatment preferences into
the final treatment recommendation.21,22 Therefore, the
objectives of the current study were 1) to elicit future
patients’ preferences for pre-CRT based on the best available evidence and 2) to identify the demographic and clinical variables that predict patients’ preferences for pre-CRT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Before the study started, ethics approval was obtained
from the research ethics board at each of the participating

Preferences for Pre-CRT in Rectal Cancer/Kennedy et al

Setting and Patient Sample
Healthy individuals who were at average risk for colorectal
cancer and who attended outpatient screening colonoscopy clinics at 2 academic teaching centers in a large city
were contacted by telephone and invited to participate in
the study. Patients were excluded from the study if they
were younger age 50 years, if they had received previous
treatment for colorectal cancer, if they were not able to
speak or understand English, or if they did not give
informed consent.
Study Design
In this study, a cross-sectional survey was administered as
a standardized, 30-minute, personal interview. Each interview consisted of 3 parts, including 1) preinterview questionnaires, 2) the threshold task to elicit participants’
preferences toward pre-CRT, and 3) a debriefing questionnaire. The preinterview questionnaire collected information about clinical and socioeconomic characteristics
(ie, work status, education, annual household income)
and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form
(SF-36), a validated quality-of-life instrument that is used
for the general population.23,24 The debriefing questionnaire consisted of a participant evaluation of the interview
format and consisted of 3 questions rated on a 5-point
Likert scale.
The Threshold Task
The threshold technique is a reliable and valid preference
assessment method that closely mirrors the patient-physician encounter by presenting the risks, benefits, and
outcomes associated with the available treatment options.25-32 For the purpose of this study, the 2 treatment
options were 1) pre-CRT followed by surgery with total
mesorectal excision (TME) 8 weeks after the completion
of pre-CRT (CR þ S) and 2) TME surgery alone (SA).
For both of these options, the surgery protocol was identical to ensure that only the patients’ preferences for preCRT were elicited. The pre-CRT protocol (45 Gray [Gy]
in 25 fractions at 1.8 Gy per fraction over 5 weeks with
continuous-infusion 5-fluororacil at 225 mg/m2 daily for
5 weeks) was selected for this study, because this is the preferred protocol at our center. Furthermore, at our center,
patients are counseled that there is a significant improvement in local recurrence but not survival with pre-CRT
based on data from the Dutch, German, and Polish rectal
cancer trials. Although the Swedish trial did demonstrate
a significant improvement in both local recurrence and
survival, the 5-year local recurrence rate of 27% suggests

Cancer

July 1, 2011

that not all patients underwent TME surgery; therefore, it
is likely that the radiation therapy compensated for nonoptimal surgery, thus leading to a survival benefit.20
Therefore, for the current study, the primary outcome
was local recurrence, and the base-case scenario represented a stage II or stage III midrectal cancer that measured between 5 cm and 10 cm from the anal verge. This
scenario was selected because pre-CRT was considered the
most effective for this subgroup of patients; and, at this
level, a restorative procedure would be performed. On the
basis of results from the Dutch and Polish rectal cancer
trials, the estimated risk of local recurrence 5 years after
undergoing anterior resection alone for a stage II or stage
III tumor that measured 5 cm to 10 cm above the anal
verge was set at 15% (Table 1).3,4,33 Bowel function data
were taken directly from the Dutch trial and also are provided in Table 1.2 Sexual function data were taken from
the study by Hendren et al, in which 180 patients with
rectal cancer were surveyed using the Female Sexual Function Index and the International Index of Erectile Function, both of which are validated scales that evaluate
sexual dysfunction in women and men, respectively.34,35
In this study, the median follow-up was 5 years, and 60%
of both men and women reported significant sexual dysfunction after treatment for rectal cancer. Furthermore,
patients who received pelvic radiation were 5.6 times
more likely (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-11.3 times
more likely; P < .05) to report that surgery made their
sexual life worse. On the basis of these data, the baseline
estimate for a noticeable change in sexual function for CR
þ S was estimated as 60%, and the corresponding baseline
estimate for SA was estimated at 30% based on the lower
limit of the 95% CI for pelvic radiation.
Procedural Steps in the Threshold Task
Each participant received a series of six 8.5  11-inch
flash cards with the headings 1) Diagnosis and Goals of
Treatment, 2) Before Surgery, 3) Surgery, 4) After Surgery,
5) Local Recurrence, and 6) Long-Term Outcomes and Summary using a standardized script. The interview began
with the interviewer reading aloud the Diagnosis and
Goals of Treatment card to the participant. This card
described an individual who had just been diagnosed with
a midrectal cancer (5-10 cm from the anal verge) and now
was considering his or her options for treatment. Participants were told that they would be making a treatment decision based on the information given about the 2
treatment options—CR þ S and SA—and that they were
to answer as though they actually were in the situation

faced by the patient described. After this, the Before Surgery, Surgery, After Surgery, Local Recurrence, and LongTerm Outcomes and Summary cards were read aloud to
the participant and presented the treatment protocol,
risks, benefits, and long-term outcomes associated with
each treatment (Fig. 1) (Summary Card only). The Local
Recurrence card was used to define and review the implications of local recurrence with the participants and is
shown in Figure 2. The purpose of the Local Recurrence
card was to provide a clear overview about local recurrence
(not an extensive discussion), and we believed it was representative of the issues that would be discussed with a
patient who had primary rectal cancer during their initial
assessment and treatment planning. In addition to the
flash cards, probabilistic sliding scales were used to visually illustrate the risk of developing a local recurrence 5
years after surgery (Fig. 3).

2856

After this information was given to the participant,
the threshold task was performed. At the start of the
threshold task, the risk of local recurrence was set at 15%
for both CR þ S and SA. This represented a clinically realistic risk of local recurrence after SA and a hypothetical
risk of local recurrence after CR þ S. The participant was
then asked which of the 2 treatment options they would
prefer initially when the risk of local recurrence was 15%
for both options. It was expected that the majority of participants initially would choose SA, because the risk of
local recurrence was the same for both options and SA was
associated with fewer inconveniences and better functional outcomes relative to CR þ S.
If the participant indicated an initial preference for
SA (as expected), then the risk of local recurrence with SA
remained at 15%, whereas the risk of local recurrence after
CR þ S was lowered systematically by 1% intervals (ie, to

14%, 13%, 12%, and down to a minimum of 0%), making CR þ S more and more appealing until the participant’s preference switched from SA to CR þ S. This
threshold point represented the absolute risk of local recurrence with pre-CRT that would be required before the
participant would choose treatment with pre-CRT. For
example, if the threshold point was 5%, then this meant
that the risk of local recurrence with pre-CRT would have
to be 5% (ie, equivalent to at least a 10% absolute risk
reduction [ARR]) before the participant would choose
treatment with pre-CRT.
Conversely, if the participant initially preferred CR
þ S when the risk of local recurrence was 15% for both
options, then this choice was confirmed with the participant by reviewing the finding that CR þ S was not any
more effective than SA and was associated with more
inconveniences and poorer functional results. Once CR þ
S was confirmed as the participant’s treatment choice, the
participant’s reasons for this choice were obtained to
determine whether or not they understood the task and
the specific reason for this choice. In all cases, if CR þ S
was preferred initially over SA, then the threshold point
was recorded as 15%, which meant that the participant

Cancer

July 1, 2011

would choose pre-CRT even when the risk of local recurrence was the same as that for SA (ie, equivalent to an
ARR of 0%). Before starting the study, the threshold task
was pilot tested on 5 healthy individuals and on 10
patients with rectal cancer who had received previous
CRT to ensure good comprehension and face validity.
Sample Size and Data Analysis
Because this study was descriptive, the sample size was
estimated to ensure a 95% CI around a threshold estimate. A sample size of 50 was required to ensure a 95%
CI with a precision of at least 0.15 for any given proportion of participants.36 Statistical testing was performed
using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). Continuation-ratio ordinal regression models were
constructed to determine demographic or clinical predictors of the participants’ threshold points. For these models, threshold points were grouped based on the natural
distribution of responses and were categorized as from
15% to 14%, from 13% to 6%, from 5% to 1%, and 0%
or not willing to switch. This ordinal outcome was
regressed onto each putative predictor in simple regressions and subsequently into 1 multivariate regression that

included all predictors. Beta coefficients from the models
were exponentiated to provide continuation odds ratios
(ORs). Although similar in concept to a traditional OR,
these ratios denote the likelihood of an individual choosing the next threshold given the current threshold level.37

Participant Characteristics
Sixty-six eligible individuals were invited to take part in
the study, and 50 (76%) completed the interview. Most
individuals declined to participate because of time constraints or prior commitments. The average age of the
study participants was 61 years, and the majority of participants were well educated, worked either full or part time,
earned >50% of the total household income, and indi-

cated that they would prefer an active role in treatment decision making (Table 4).
Distribution of the Participants’ Threshold
Points
The distribution of the participants’ threshold points varied widely across the entire spectrum of available scalar
values (Fig. 4). Overall, 23 of 50 participants (46%) said
that they would choose pre-CRT if the risk of local recurrence with pre-CRT was >5% (ie, equivalent to an ARR
between 0% and 9%). Conversely, 27 of 50 participants
(54%) said that they would choose pre-CRT only if the
risk of local recurrence with pre-CRT was 5% (ie,
equivalent to an ARR 10%). It is noteworthy that 8 of
50 participants (16%) said that they would prefer preCRT even when there was no benefit over SA (ie, equivalent to an ARR of 0%), and 4 of 50 participants (8%) said

Participant Evaluation of the Interview
Format
Although the interview involved a considerable amount of
detailed information, it was our experience that, in real
time, the interviews ran smoothly; and, on average, the
interview was completed within 30 minutes. Although
66% of participants felt that they received the right
amount of information, 22% reported that they would
have preferred a little more information. Overall, 90% of
participants felt that the interview and the threshold task
were easy to understand; and 90% believed that that, if
they actually were faced with the treatment decision
outlined in the clinical scenario, the interview would be
helpful for making a treatment decision.

that they would not agree to pre-CRT even if the risk of
local recurrence with pre-CRT was 0% (ie, equivalent to
an ARR of 15%). The 8 patients who preferred pre-CRT
when it did not include any benefit indicated that they
understood that CR þ S was not any more effective than
SA; however, they believed that, psychologically, they
would feel better knowing that they had done everything
possible to cure their rectal cancer.

Component Scale (PCS) (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08;

risk of local recurrence with pre-CRT. However, none of

DISCUSSION
The results from this study demonstrated that participants’ preferences for pre-CRT were distributed widely,
and there were no clinical or demographic variables associated with the participants’ treatment preferences. The
finding that 54% of participants would not choose preCRT until it offered a risk of local recurrence 5% (ie,
equivalent to an ARR 10% or a 67% relative risk reduction) suggests that a significant proportion of patients
may be willing to accept a higher risk of local recurrence
to avoid pre-CRT.
The current results are important, because they validate and add to the generalizability of 2 previous studies
in this area by Couture et al and Harrison et al.38,39 Taken
together, these 3 studies have demonstrated that both
future patients and patients who currently have colorectal
cancer seem to highly value functional outcomes and may
be willing to accept a higher risk of local recurrence (ie,
forego pre-CRT) to achieve these outcomes. Couture et al
reported that 31 of 47 patients with colorectal cancer
(65%) would not accept postoperative CRT (post-CRT)
until the 10% baseline risk of local recurrence was reduced
to 5% (ie, equivalent to an ARR <5% or a 50% relative
risk reduction).38 In this study, 11 of 47 participants
(23%) were unwilling to accept post-CRT even when the
risk of local recurrence was 0% (ie, equivalent to an ARR
of 10%). In a second study by Harrison et al, 52 of 100
patients with colorectal cancer (52%) were willing to
trade, on average, 24% of their remaining life expectancy
to avoid pre-CRT relative to anterior resection alone.39

2859

Original Article

Figure 4. This chart illustrates the distribution of participants’ threshold points for preoperative chemoradiation (pre-CRT). Note
that patients did not switch to pre-CRT even when the risk of local recurrence with pre-CRT was 0%.

Furthermore, it is not only patients who seem willing to accept a less effective treatment option to achieve
improved functional results. Solomon et al elicited the
attitudes of patients with colorectal cancer and of physicians toward local excision versus abdominal perineal
resection (ie, colostomy) for rectal cancer.40 In their study,
although 50 of 97 patients (52%) were willing to trade life
expectancy to avoid a colostomy and would choose to
undergo transanal excision, significantly more colorectal
surgeons (38 of 43; 88%) and oncologists (93 of 103;
90%) were willing to trade, on average, 12% to 14% of
their remaining life expectancy to avoid a colostomy and
would choose undergo transanal excision. Eddy has classified clinical treatment policies as standards, guidelines,
and options based on the strength of evidence for the
treatment outcomes and the distribution of patients’ preferences for these outcomes.41 In this classification, standards apply when patients unanimously agree on the
overall desirability of the known outcomes, guidelines
apply when the majority agrees on the overall desirability
of the known outcomes, and options apply when patients
are split evenly on the overall desirability of the known
outcomes. On the basis of this classification, it seems rea-

2860

sonable that the use of pre-CRT should be considered as a
treatment option rather than a guideline.
Because it has been demonstrated that being a
women, younger age, and higher education are independent predictors of a preferred active role in the treatment
decision-making process, a regression analysis was conducted to determine whether there were any independent
demographic or clinical predictors for the actual choice of
treatment. Although there were no independent predictors of treatment choice identified in the current study, 2
other studies in patients with breast cancer that used individually tailored decision-support tools demonstrated that
younger age, higher income, and treatment by universitybased physician were independent predictors of a treatment choice for adjuvant chemotherapy.42,43 It is noteworthy that, to our knowledge, there has been no
investigation into the risks and benefits of physician
awareness of these demographic and clinical predictors on
the patient-physician interaction, the preferred role in
treatment decision making, or the actual treatment
choice.
The participants’ positive evaluation of the interview
format suggests that patients wanted to be involved in the

decision-making process, were able to understand the
issues, and believed that the information provided in this
study would be helpful in arriving at a treatment decision
for pre-CRT. Therefore, the interview format used in this
study easily could be developed into a formal decision
board and used to assist both patients and physicians with
treatment decision making regarding pre-CRT.
For this study, healthy patients who were at average
risk for developing colorectal cancer were interviewed
rather than patients with colorectal cancer. Although the
scenario was hypothetical for this group, it did represent a
group of individuals who actually could be faced with this
treatment decision in the future (ie, future patients).
Patients with colorectal cancer were not selected for this
study because we believed that their responses may have
been biased by their previous treatment. Furthermore,
patients who actually had faced a decision about pre-CRT
were not included because we did not believe that their
inclusion would be ethically appropriate or feasible given
the sample size required. However, it is worth noting that
our results are similar to those from the studies by Couture et al and Harrison et al, who interviewed patients
with colorectal cancer. A common criticism of patient
preference studies is that participants do not comprehend
the clinical issues, such as local recurrence, as fully as treating physicians. However, in the studies by Harrison et al
and Solomon et al, physicians were even more willing to
trade life expectancy (and to accept higher rates of local recurrence) than patients, and those findings serve to support the results from our current study.
Finally, the data presented to participants in the current study were based primarily on results from the Dutch
TME trial, which evaluated pre-RT, and not pre-CRT.
These data were used because we believed that they provided the highest quality evidence for local recurrence and
bowel function. More recently, increasing evidence has
indicated that local recurrence rates and functional outcomes with pre-RT and pre-CRT are similar (Table 1).6,7
Similarly, the description of local recurrence used for the
current study reflected the description that was given to
patients at our center and, thus, may or may not be as
detailed as the description used at other centers. Although
the use of these data may have limited our study, it is
unlikely that these data would significantly change the
overall ‘‘big-picture’’ finding that patients’ preferences for
pre-CRT are widely distributed and that patients highly
value functional results after treatment for rectal cancer.
In conclusion, the current report adds to a growing
body of literature that both colorectal cancer patients and

Cancer

their physicians seem to highly value functional outcomes
and may be willing to accept a less effective treatment
option to achieve better functional outcomes. Therefore,
developers of future guidelines will need to strongly
reconsider the use of pre-CRT for all patients with stage II
and stage III rectal cancer and may need to downgrade the
recommendation for pre-CRT from a guideline to an
option for both midrectal and upper rectal cancers.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
Dr. Baxter has received an Early Researcher Award from the
Ontario Ministry of Health and Innovation.
