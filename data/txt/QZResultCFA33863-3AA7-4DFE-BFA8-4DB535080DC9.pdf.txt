BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NBL) is a common pediatric solid tumor, and outcomes for patients with advanced neuroblastoma
remain poor despite extremely aggressive treatment. Chemotherapy resistance at relapse contributes heavily to treatment failure. The
poor survival of patients with high-risk NBL prompted this investigation into novel treatment options with the objective of gaining a
better understanding of resistance mechanisms. On the basis of previous work and on data from publicly available studies, the
authors hypothesized that human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (Her4) contributes to resistance. METHODS: Her4 expression
was reduced with small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to over express intracellular HER4, and the authors tested its impact on tumor cell survival under various culture conditions. The resulting changes in gene expression after HER4 knockdown were measured by using a
messenger RNA (mRNA) array. RESULTS: HER4 expression was up-regulated in tumor spheres compared with the expression in
monolayer culture. With HER4 knockdown, NBL cells became less resistant to anoikis and serum starvation. Moreover, HER4 knockdown increased the chemosensitivity of NBL cells to cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and activated ifosfamide. In mRNA array analysis, HER4 knockdown predominately altered genes related to cell cycle regulation. In NBL spheres compared with monolayers, cell
proliferation was decreased, and cyclin D expression was reduced. HER4 knockdown reversed cyclin D suppression. Overexpressed
intracellular HER4 slowed the cell cycle and induced chemoresistance. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that HER4 protects NBL cells from multiple exogenous apoptotic stimuli, including anoikis, nutrient deficiency, and cytotoxic chemotherapy. The intracellular fragment of HER4 was sufficient to confer this phenotype. HER4 functions as a cell cycle suppressor, maintaining
resistance to cellular stress. The current findings indicate that HER4 overexpression may be associated with refractory disease, and

INTRODUCTION
Neuroblastoma is a common childhood cancer that is diagnosed most frequently before age 1 year.1 Approximately 50%
of patients are at high risk, with survival rates of <40% despite intensive multimodal therapy. Relapsed disease is rarely
cured, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic options for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.
Therapies against the v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ERBB) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2], HER3, and
HER4) have improved outcomes for some patients with common carcinomas.2 We and others have reported the relation
between ERBB receptors and neuroblastoma,3-5 suggesting ERBB signaling promotes neuroblastoma growth and survival.
We previously reported superior in vivo growth inhibition from a pan-ERBB inhibitor compared with EGFR-specific
therapy.4,6 An immunohistochemistry study of neuroblastoma patient samples suggested that HER4 may correlate with
worse outcomes.5 We recently used a publicly available oncogenomic data set to analyze the prognostic impact of HER4
expression in patients with neuroblastoma.7 In 4 independent data sets, higher HER4 expression was correlated significantly with reduced survival (Fig. 1). Notably, these DNA microarray data were generated by different probes that recognize different HER4 sequences, suggesting that the observed difference is unlikely to be caused by artifact. Collectively,
the evidence cited above elevates the importance of HER4 in neuroblastoma and warrants further mechanistic study.

HER4 Confers Stress Resistance in NBL/Hua et al

Figure 1. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (Her4) expression in neuroblastoma was correlated with a worse prognosis
in 4 independent genomic screens. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were generated from (A) the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
Exon Array Neuroblastoma Database (transcript cluster 2597552; cutoff, 0.248); (B) the Oncogenomics Neuroblastoma Prognosis Database (probe 51939; cutoff, 0.78); (C) the Neuroblastoma Prognosis Database-Oberthuer Laboratory (probe

data sets were accessed through the Oncogenomics Section Data Center of the Pediatric Oncology Branch of the NCI (Javed
Khan, MD, principal investigator.)

HER4 forms homodimers or heterodimers with the
other ERBB members to activate signaling by multiple
second messengers, and that signaling is pivotal for its
final biologic effects.2 One means by which HER4 may
contribute to malignant behavior is increased expression
of Her4 in nonadherent tumor spheroids, possibly
because of signaling mediated by cell-cell adhesion.8
Three-dimensional cultured tumor spheroids are known
to have acquired chemoresistance and radioresistance,9-11
which have been reported for various cancer types.9-12
Although neuroblastoma may have the same pattern of
multicellular resistance (MCR),13 very few studies have
focused specifically on elucidating the underlying
mechanism.
The role of HER4 in cancer remains controversial.14-16 HER4 expression was reported as an adverse
prognostic factor in some studies17 but a favorable factor
in others, even in reports on the same tumor type.18,19
These disparate results may arise from the expression of 4
alternatively spliced isoforms of HER4, which differ
in subcellular localization and function.20,21 The alternatively used a exon (JM-a/JM-d isoforms) encodes a
recognition element for disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 preproprotein

(ADAM17)-mediated proteolysis. Isoforms lacking this
exon (juxtamembrane [JM]-b/JM-c) cannot be cleaved by
ADAM17. After 2-step proteolysis by ADAM17
(required first) and then c-secretase, the cytosolic fragment of HER4 (HER4 intracellular domain [4ICD]/p80)
is released from the membrane and may traffic to the nucleus.22 The CYT-1 and CYT-2 isoforms differ in their
subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways
and protein degradation processes.23 Some studies failed
to distinguish between membranous, cytoplasmic, and
nuclear expression of HER4, confounding associations
between expression and outcome.
To assess the role of HER4 in neuroblastoma, we
evaluated HER4 expression under different culture conditions, discovering HER4 up-regulation during cell stress.
HER4 knockdown by small-hairpin RNA (shRNA)
decreased resistance to multiple adverse factors, including
loss of attachment, serum starvation, and cytotoxic agents.
Transduced intracellular HER4 reduced cell proliferation
and protected cells from apoptosis. Our findings suggest
that HER4 plays a protective role against cellular stress in
neuroblastoma, indicating that HER4 expression may be
an unfavorable prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target for neuroblastoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Reagents

The neuroblastoma cell lines IMR32, CHP134, and
LAI-55N were cultured as described previously.4 COL,
cultured as described,16 was previously identified as an
osteosarcoma. However, based on its expression of cluster
of differentiation 56 (CD56 [neural cell adhesion molecule]) and Nestin; its lack of expression of other small,
round, blue cell tumor markers; its massive N-Myc amplification; and its in vivo growth characteristics (pseudorosette formation, metastasis to bone marrow, liver, and
retro-orbital space in severe combined immunodeficient
[SCID] mice), it is now confirmed that COL is a neuroblastoma. All cell lines were authenticated using short tandem repeat DNA fingerprinting by the Characterized Cell
Line Core Facility at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center. For the sphere culture condition,
single cell suspensions mobilized from monolayers were
seeded onto poly(hydroxyethyl)methacrylate-precoated
plates precoated plates (1  105cells/cm2; Sigma-Aldrich
Corporation, St. Louis, Mo). Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin [CDDP]), doxorubicin (DXR), and etoposide (VP-16) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Corporation, and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide (4-H-ifo) was
purchased from Niomech (Bielefeld, Germany).
Cell Proliferation and Viability Assay

Cell proliferation was measured by direct nucleus counting as described previously24 or by Alamar Blue assay in a
96-well format.
Soft Agar Clonogenic Assay

Soft agar clonogenesis was assessed as described previously.25 Cells were seeded in 0.35% top agar at 2000 cells
per well on 0.5% bottom agar in 6-well plates. After 21
days, viable colonies were stained with 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT;
Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo), photographed (ChemiDoc XRS; Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif), and
counted by Quantitive One software (Bio-Rad).
DNA Vector Design and Retroviral Transduction

The shRNA sequences for human HER4 targeting
shRNA were as follows: sense, 50 GATCCCCGCCA
AGAAAGCGTTTGACATTCAAGAGATGTCAAAC
GCTTTCTTGGCTTTTTC30 ; and antisense, 50 TCGA
GAAAAAGCCAAGAAAGCGTTTGACATCTCTTGA

antisense, 50 TCGAGAAAAAGCGCGCTTTGTAGGA
5142

TTCGTCTCTTGAACGAATCCTACAAAGCGCGC
GGG30 . The shRNA was inserted into a circular pSuperior.retro.neoþgfp (OligoEngine) vector after digestion
with BgLII and XhoI (New England BioLabs, Ipswitch,
Mass). HER4 intracellular domain inserts 4ICD-CYT1
and 4ICD-CYT2 were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction analysis using described techniques22 and was
inserted into the multiple cloning site of the MIgR1mKate2-C retroviral expression vector to create a 4ICD
with a c-terminal mKate2 tag. The MIgR1-mKate2-C
vector was generated from the Hes1-MIgR1 vector25 by
replacement of Hes1 (first position) with mKate226 and
replacement of EGFR with a puromycin resistance gene.
Cells were transduced as described perviously,25 selected
for puromycin resistance, then analyzed by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting for far-red fluorescence.
Western Blot Analysis

Cells were lysed and immunoblotted as described.24 Primary antibodies for EGFR and HER4 (antibodies 1902-1
and 1200-1, respectively; Epitomics, Burlingame, Calif)
and for poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase
(PARP) and cyclin D (antibodies 9542 and 2978, respectively; Cell Signaling Inc., Danvers, Mass). Beta-actin
(Sigma-Aldrich Corporation) served as a loading control.
Cell Cycle Analysis

Monolayer-cultured cells were detached by cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). Spheres were
pelleted by centrifuge and disaggregated by incubation
with cell dissociation buffer for 10 minutes in 37 C. The
cell cycle was analyzed with propidium iodide and flow
cytometry as previously described.24
Messenger RNA Microarray Analysis

Col-NC and Col-SH2 cells were grown in 6-well plates
with 4 replicates each of monolayer or spheres. Total
RNA was extracted using a mirVana microRNA Isolation
Kit (Ambion-Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif). Total
RNA was amplified and converted into biotin-labeled
combinational RNA (cRNA) using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego,
Calif). After purification, 0.75 lg cRNA were fragmented
and hybridized to HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChip (Illumina,
Inc.). The chips were scanned with iScan system (Illumina, Inc.), and the signal intensities were quantified and
summarized using GenomeStudio software (Illumina,
Inc.). After removal of the probe sets with intensities
below noise, the data were quantile normalized. The significantly differentially expressed genes were identified
using 2-sample t tests and a beta-uniform mixture model
to control the false-discovery rate at 5%. The pathway

analysis was performed using the significant genes in the
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software.
Bromodeoxyuridine Incorporation Assay

Monolayer cells were treated with bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) for 15 minutes before harvesting, whereas spheres
were incubated with BrdU overnight. The cells were fixed
and treated with DNase, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-BrdU antibody (1:50 dilution; Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and analyzed
with flow cytometry.
RESULTS
HER4 Expression Was Density-Dependent and
Up-Regulated in Sphere Culture

We measured the expression of HER4 in neuroblastoma
cell lines by Western blot analysis. In Col and CHP134
cells, HER4 expression increased with increasing cell density (Fig. 2A). When converted from monolayer to anchorage-independent culture, neuroblastoma cells tended to
aggregate spontaneously and formed tumor microspheres
as previously described.27 We detected a striking up-regulation of HER4 in neuroblastoma spheres; the range of upregulation varied from 1.4-fold to 6.3-fold (Fig. 2B,C).
Notably, cell lines with low basal levels of HER4 exhibited
much higher up-regulation than cell lines with high basal
levels of HER4 expression. Moreover, even in high-expressing HER4 cells LAI-55N that had minor HER4 up-regulation, we observed increased intracellular HER4 expression
(Fig. 2D). We also compared EGFR, HER2, and HER3
expression between monolayer and sphere cultures. Unlike
HER4 expression, EGFR expression did not increase in
sphere culture, whereas basal HER2 and HER3 expression
levels were too low to detect4 and did not increase in sphere
culture (data not shown). These data demonstrate that
HER4 expression varies depending on culture conditions,
suggesting that HER4 may regulate the response to different conditions.
Neuroblastoma Tumor Spheres Exhibited
Chemoresistance

We seeded Col and CHP134 cells onto plates that were
precoated with nonadherent substrate. After 24 hours,
compact spheres were generated spontaneously (Fig.
3A1). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that individual tumor cells adhered tightly with adjacent cells, such
that the cell boundary was obscure (Fig. 3A2). Further
culture for 96 hours resulted in a mixture of healthy, necrotic, and apoptotic cells in the center of the spheres (Fig.
3A3). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that
tight cell-cell adhesion was well established within spheres
Cancer

October 15, 2012

(Fig. 3A4). We compared cell proliferation in monolayer
and sphere culture using an Alamar Blue assay. Tumor
spheres grew at a much lower rate than monolayer culture
with elongated doubling time (Fig. 3B). We reasoned
that, because chemotherapy predominantly affects cells
that are rapidly dividing, the slower growing cells in
spheres may be more resistant to chemotherapy. To
observe whether the sphere culture would cause neuroblastoma cells to be less sensitive to chemotherapy, we
compared cell viability between monolayer culture and
spheres after exposure to drugs that are used clinically for
neuroblastoma therapy: CDDP, DXR, VP-16, and 4-Hifo. Col and CHP134 cells in sphere culture were more
chemoresistant than cells grown in monolayer (Fig. 3C).
These results suggest that neuroblastoma cells can survive
and grow in anchorage-independent conditions by forming spheres, which confers a chemoresistant phenotype,
perhaps because of reduced proliferation.
Knockdown of HER4 Suppressed
Anchorage-Independent Survival

Because HER4 is up-regulated in sphere culture, we investigated whether the up-regulation is proapoptotic or protective for cells. If HER4 is crucial for cells to survival, then
survival will decrease when HER4 is inhibited. To address
this question, we used shRNA to knockdown HER4
expression in Col cells, because they had the greatest HER4
increase when transferring from monolayer to sphere culture. We selected 3 clones that had stable HER4 expression
reductions >95% (Fig. 4A). First, we tested the impact of
HER4 knockdown on proliferation. After 72 hours in
monolayer culture, a slight decrease in cell yield was
observed (Fig. 4B), possibly because of slightly increased
apoptosis, as demonstrated by increased PARP cleavage in
3 shRNA clones (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we conducted a
soft agar clonogenic assay to measure anchorage-independent growth. The cells with HER4 knockdown had a significant reduction in colony formation (P < .001) (Fig. 4C).
The soft agar clonogenic assay measures tumor survival as single cells in the anchorage-independent condition. Multicellular tumor spheres may be more resistant
to cellular stress (see Fig. 3), so we wanted to determine
whether HER4 knockdown also could affect the survival
of tumor spheres. We conducted a cell cycle analysis
based on propidium iodide staining and quantified the
sub-G1 population to represent cell death. We observed
that cells grown in sphere culture exhibited G1 arrest
compared with monolayer culture, consistent with our
observation that tumor spheres are slow-growing. HER4
knockdown caused a slight increase in the sub-G1

(Fig. 4A), indicating apoptosis. Together, these findings
demonstrated that knockdown of HER4 in Col cells
reduced survival in anchorage-independent growth by
increasing apoptosis both in single-cell or multicellular
spheres. This indicates that HER4 is crucial for anoikis
resistance in neuroblastoma.

starvation had any impact on HER4 expression. After culturing Col and CHP134 cells without fetal bovine serum
for 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours, HER4 was up-regulated in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). The HER4
intracellular fragment also increased in proportion to the

in survival during serum deprivation, Col cells with nonsense and HER4–specific shRNA were cultured in monolayers or as spheroids, and fetal bovine serum was

before we measured the cell cycle. In monolayer culture,
HER4 knockdown cells had a higher sub-G1 population
in response to serum deprivation, whereas nonsense control cells had few cells in the sub-G1 population (Fig. 5B).
In tumor spheres, the increase in the sub-G1 population
caused by HER4 knockdown was even more dramatic
because of the coexistence of 2 stress factors (Fig. 5B).
These data indicate that HER4 knockdown caused Col
cells to become less resistant to limited nutrition. Because
Cancer

nutrition insufficiency is a very common event in solid
tumors (because of the high metabolism of cancer), this
finding suggests that HER4 may be critical for tumor cells
to adapt to nutritional insufficiency in neuroblastoma.
HER4 Knockdown Increased Chemosensitivity

We have observed chemoresistance in neuroblastoma tumor spheres, and our previous data support a role for
HER4 in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation.

Therefore, we investigated whether HER4 up-regulation
in tumor spheres contributes to chemo-resistance. We
performed a viability assay on cell lines with knocked
down HER4 after exposure to the drugs commonly used
in treating neuroblastoma. After 72 hours, all HER4
knockdown cells presented lower viability upon treatment

clones had a dramatically greater proportion of the subG1 population compared with nonsense control cells
(Fig. 6B), indicating increased apoptosis. With HER4
knockdown, monolayer cells had increased chemosensitivity, and tumor spheres lost their chemoresistance phenotype. These findings suggest that HER4 is required to
provide neuroblastoma cells with a protective mechanism
against cytotoxic drugs. The resistance to chemotherapy
Cancer

HER4 Confers Stress Resistance in NBL/Hua et al

observed in neuroblastoma cells when cultured as tumor
spheres is partially because of HER4 up-regulation.
HER4 Is Involved in Cell Cycle Regulation

To understand how HER4 contributes to stress protection and chemoresistance, we used a messenger RNA
(mRNA) microarray to identify changes in gene expression induced by HER4 knockdown. Col cells were transduced with HER4-specific or control shRNA and
cultured in either monolayers or spheres; mRNA was isolated from 5 individual biologic replicates under each condition. We measured the gene expression of all samples
using the HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.).
We compared control versus knockdown samples for each
condition, and differentially expressed genes were identified with a 5% false-discovery rate. To categorize these
changes functionally, we used IPA. In monolayers, the
‘‘molecular and cellular functions’’ most altered by Her4
knockdown were cell cycle-associated genes. In the more
stressed sphere condition, however, the most significant
categorized function is ‘‘cell death,’’ as expected from the
data illustrated in Figures 3 through 6. Genes associated
with ‘‘DNA replication, recombination, and repair’’
changed with HER4 knockdown in both conditions (Fig.
7A). We hypothesized that HER4 knockdown would
result in an alteration of the cell cycle, which may contribute to the vulnerability of HER4 knockdown cells. To further explore how HER4 may regulate gene expression, the
associations between HER4 and the identified genes with
differential expression in the ‘‘cell cycle,’’ ‘‘cell death,’’ and
‘‘DNA replication, recombination, and repair’’ categories
were mapped using the network function of IPA centered
on Her4 (Fig. 7A). This network identified potential
mechanisms by which HER4 may regulate the cell cycle
and cell death. However, more studies are required to confirm and elucidate the functional relation of these genes.
To follow-up on the potential role of HER4 in the
cell cycle that we observed in the microarray data, we
measured cell cycle-related molecules in HER4 knockdown and control cells by Western blot analysis. Similar
to previous findings reported by others,27 we observed
that cyclin D was suppressed in spheres compared with
monolayers (Fig. 7B), which was reflected in reduced proliferation and G1 arrest (54.8%  0.7% vs
63.1%  0.7%; P < .001) (Fig. 7C,D). However, HER4
knockdown partially rescued the suppression of cyclin D
caused by sphere culture. In parallel, cell cycle analysis
revealed a significantly smaller proportion of cells in G1phase among HER4 knockdown cells (Fig. 7C). Together, these data suggest that cells would respond protecCancer

October 15, 2012

tively to stress by arresting the cell cycle in G1 phase,
allowing more time for DNA repair. However, HER4
knockdown impairs this mechanism and drives cell cycle
progression, leading to increased apoptosis.
The HER4 Intracellular Domain Suppressed the
Cell Cycle and Conferred Chemoresistance

Because HER4 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), we
wanted to investigate whether the activity of the tyrosine
kinase is responsible for the stress-protective role of
HER4. Because, to our knowledge, there is no HER4-specific RTK inhibitor, we used CI-1033, a pan-ERBB inhibitor, to inhibit HER4 activation. In addition, an
antibody (clone H4.72.8; Thermo Scientific, Braunschweig, Germany) that recognizes the ectodomain of
HER4,28 also was used to inhibit the binding of heregulin, a ligand of HER4, which blocked the activation of the
HER4 tyrosine kinase. However, neither CI-1033 nor the
HER4-blocking antibody reproduced the impact of
HER4 knockdown on the cells (data not shown). Because
the intracellular fragment of HER4 can function as a transcription factor,18,29,30 we asked investigated intracellular
HER4 was sufficient to confer stress protection. To study
how intracellular HER4 would impact the cells, we transduced Col cells with the intracellular HER4 isoforms
CYT-1 and CYT-2. Both HER4 isoforms reduced cell
yield after 3 days of growth (Fig. 8A,B). To determine
whether the loss of cell yield was caused by reduced proliferation, we performed a BrdU incorporation assay to measure S-phase cells. Consistent with the proliferation assay,
Col-CYT-1 and Col-CYT-2 had lower percentages of
dividing cells than control cells, as indicated by the proportion of BrdU-positive cells (Fig. 8C). We further
tested whether this suppressed cell cycle would confer chemoresistance. Although both isoforms conferred resistance to CDDP, overexpression of the CYT-1 HER4
isoform produced a more resistant phenotype (Fig. 8D).
These results support the notion that the HER4 intracellular fragment regulates the cell cycle. Together with previous data, our findings indicate that neuroblastoma cells
adapt to cell stress by up-regulating HER4 to acquire a relatively slow-growing phenotype and to protect themselves
from apoptosis.
DISCUSSION
Resisting cell death is one of the hallmarks of cancer.31
Under less than ideal conditions, such as serum starvation,
loss of attachment, hypoxia, etc, cancer cells usually have
greater resistance to death than normal cells. An improved
understanding of the mechanisms that provide this resistance to stress may clarify the reasons for treatment failure

in patients with cancer. In the current study, we observed
altered expression of HER4 in neuroblastoma cells in
response to changes in the culture environment. In particular, there was up-regulation of HER4 when cells were
exposed to diverse stressors. This led us to consider 2
opposing roles for the function of HER4 inside the cell.
First, HER4 may mediate proapoptotic signaling to trigger cell death. Second, HER4 may mediate the up-regulation or down-regulation of diverse genes required for cells
to survive under stress. Both models have been proposed
by other investigators.8,18 In our study, we sought to
determine whether HER4 acts to promote cell survival or
cell death in neuroblastoma cells and to identify the mechanism by which it acts. Identifying how HER4 contributes to malignant behavior could provide new therapeutic
opportunities.
First, we observed density-dependent HER4 expression: HER4 was up-regulated when cells cultured in vitro
became more confluent. A high level of confluence causes
increased cell-cell adhesion because of the close proximity
of cells to one another. Cell-cell adhesion mediates important biologic functions, including transduction of proliferative signals.8 Low-confluence cell culture is considered
a poor experimental model, because it lacks cell-cell adhesion and bears less resemblance to a solid tumor. Our
findings indicate that cells in greater confluence express
more HER4 than cells in lower confluence, suggesting
that cell-cell adhesion may trigger downstream signals to
increase HER4 expression. It is widely known that cancer
cells typically have no contact inhibition, and this feature
is considered a manifestation of malignancy.31 Here, we
have demonstrated that HER4 is up-regulated upon
reaching confluence. This up-regulation may be 1 of the
mechanisms that regulate the suppression of contact inhibition in cancer cells. Furthermore, over confluence is
stressful because of a lack of sufficient nutrients, space,
etc, which would cause an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and would induce senescence32 and, thus, the
up-regulation of HER4 when over confluence may be
protecting cells from stress. A similar finding was been
observed previously with regard to heat-shock protein 27
(HSP27), a well known cell stress protector.33
We also observed that, when neuroblastoma cells
were grown on nonadherent plates, they aggregated spontaneously to form compact spheroids, which has been
observed in different cancer types.9,34,35 The multicellular
tumor sphere usually is considered a model that holds an
intermediate complexity between monolayer cell culture
and an in vivo model,9 and it may be a useful tool for
mimicking avascular tumor regions and micrometastases
5152

in the prevascularized stage. It is regarded as a better
model than monolayer cell culture, because it resembles
solid tumors more closely in several respects, including
tight cell-cell adhesion,27,36 moderate proliferation rate,27
hypoxic microenvironment,37 and chemotherapy/radiation resistance.10,12,27 One important factor that may
cause therapy ineffectiveness is the intrinsic resistance to
the adverse environment that comes from the 3-dimensional structure within the bulk of tumors: MCR.10 Our
data reveal that HER4 up-regulation is 1 of the events that
occur during the acquisition of MCR. We believe that
HER4 may be an important factor contributing to MCR,
because HER4 knockdown caused a phenotype that was
more vulnerable to the stressors used in our experiment.
This would strengthen the point that it may serve as a
therapeutic target.
The acquisition of anoikis resistance is perceived as
1 of the prominent features of tumorigenesis31 and is associated with metastasis. Some groups used the multicellular
tumor sphere model to study anoikis resistance.27,38,39
Although tumor cells in this model are not fully ‘‘homeless’’ because of the multicellular structure of the sphere,
tumor cells do suffer from loss of attachment in early
stages when cells are still in suspension as single cells. For
tumor spheres as a whole, the anchorage-independent culture condition still is stressful, and the cells had decreased
proliferation. A proteomic analysis of neuroblastoma tumor spheres revealed changes in proteins that regulate the
cell stress response.35 Thus, the stress that cells undergo in
tumor spheres could cause a reactive up-regulation of
HER4 if HER4 indeed is a cell stress regulator. Our
results revealed that knockdown of HER4 made neuroblastoma cells more susceptible to death from loss of
attachment, indicating that HER4 protects cells from
anoikis by regulating response to cellular stress. Because
anoikis resistance is associated with metastasis, it is possible to use HER4 as a target to reduce tumor metastasis.
The effect of reducing tumor metastasis may be increased
by combining HER4-targeted therapy with established
regimens for treating malignant tumors with chemotherapeutics or radiation therapy.
Serum starvation is a well established approach for
inducing a broad range of cellular stress. It induces oxidative stress and causes an accumulation of intracellular
ROS.40 In the current study, we observed the up-regulation of HER4 upon serum starvation in neuroblastoma
cell lines and 293T cells (data not shown). We also demonstrated that HER4 knockdown rendered the cells less
tolerant to serum deprivation. It has been demonstrated
that HER4 signaling protects neural-origin tumor cells

from serum starvation41 and oxidative stress.42 Another
group demonstrated that ROS activates neuregulin-1b/
HER4 paracrine signaling in the heart, suggesting that
HER4 is involved in cardiac adaptation to oxidative
stress.43 Together with our findings, these data support
the proposition that stress-induced HER4 expression may
function protectively to maintain homeostasis and prevent apoptosis.
The role of HER4 in cancer has been controversial.14,18,44-47 One possible explanation for the conflicting
observations may be that different isoforms and the subcellular localizations of HER4 differ in function.15,20 It
has been established that 4ICD functions as a transcription factor in the nucleus.29,48,49 In the current study, our
experimental model using neuroblastoma proposes
another explanation for the contradiction. Our results
demonstrated that HER4 sufficiently protects cancer cells
from different kinds of cellular stressors that can contribute to the malignancy. In contrast, insertion and overexpression of 4ICD suppressed the cell cycle and cell
proliferation, making HER4 take on an ‘‘inhibitory’’ role.
One recent study suggested that high HER4 expression
correlates with a low mitosis karyorrhexis index, an indicator of mitosis activity. However, those investigators also
observed that high HER4 expression was associated with
clinical high-risk groups, metastasis, and poorer survival,5
consistent with our laboratory findings. The regulation of
tumor dormancy affects metastasis and therapeutic
response.50,51 In essence, these observations point to the
idea that tumors growing more slowly may be harder to
treat. Together with our findings, these reports suggest
that, although HER4 may reduce proliferation, its overexpression renders a refractory phenotype, which may be
highly dependent on the microenvironment. Although
the prognostic relevance of HER4 in neuroblastoma needs
to be confirmed with larger scale clinical-pathologic analyses, at the least, levels of HER4 expression should be considered as 1 important factor that influences outcome.
In conclusion, HER4 expression can be induced by
various types of cellular stress in neuroblastoma and functions to protect cells from apoptosis. HER4 knockdown
increases the vulnerability of neuroblastoma cells to chemotherapy. Intracellular HER4 may provide protection
from stress by slowing proliferation and conferring
increased chemoresistance. Further investigation is
required to understand the consequences of HER4 intracellular signaling and whether signaling at the membrane
is required in conjunction with the transcriptional regulation provided by the soluble HER4 fragment to provide
protection from stress. Thus, HER4 has been suggested as
Cancer

a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma and Ewing
sarcoma,8 and this may raise interest in developing new
strategies against HER4 in pediatric solid tumors.
