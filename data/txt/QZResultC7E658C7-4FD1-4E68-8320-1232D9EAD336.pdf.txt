Translation Regulation as a Therapeutic Target in Cancer
Michal Grzmil and Brian A. Hemmings

Abstract
Protein synthesis is a vital cellular process that regulates growth and metabolism. It is controlled via signaling
networks in response to environmental changes, including the presence of nutrients, mitogens, or starvation. The
phosphorylation state of proteins involved in translation initiation is a limiting factor that regulates the formation
or activity of translational complexes. In cancer cells, hyperactivated signaling pathways inﬂuence translation,
allowing uncontrolled growth and survival. In addition, several components of translation initiation have been
found to be mutated, posttranslationally modiﬁed, or differentially expressed, and some act as oncogenes in
cancer cells. Translational alterations can increase the overall rate of protein synthesis as well as activate
regulatory mechanisms leading to the translation of speciﬁc messenger RNAs for proteins that promote cancer
progression and survival. Many recent studies investigating such mechanisms have produced ideas for therapeutic
intervention. This review describes altered mechanisms of protein synthesis in human cancers and discusses
therapeutic approaches based on the targeting of translation. Cancer Res; 72(16); 3891–900. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Protein synthesis is a major factor in determining cell
phenotype and is tightly regulated during growth and development. A recent global analysis of mammalian gene expression showed that mRNA levels can explain 40% of variability
in protein levels, and indicated that the translation rate has a
dominant role in controlling cellular protein levels (1).
Improper protein synthesis can lead to cell apoptosis or
disease. In human cancers, hyperactivation of signal transduction pathways induces cancer growth associated with an
increase in overall protein synthesis. In addition, selective
synthesis of many proteins that inﬂuence cancer progression
or confer resistance to cancer treatment may be regulated
posttranscriptionally via translation initiation. For example, an
analysis of glioma cell response to radiation revealed that the
number of genes whose expression was regulated via translation was 10-fold higher than those regulated via transcription
(2). This indicates that cellular responses that occur via translation alterations may represent major survival pathways.

Cap-Dependent Protein Synthesis in Cancer
Translation proceeds by initiation, elongation, termination,
and ribosome recycling, with most of the regulatory mechanisms occurring during the rate-limiting initiation step. As
previously reviewed (3, 4), during the ﬁrst steps of cap-depen-

dent translation initiation, messenger RNA associates at its
50 UTR with the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F, comprising
the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the scaffold protein eIF4G, and
the 50 UTR unwinding RNA helicase eIF4A that operates in
conjunction with eIF4B. At the 30 UTR end, associated poly-A
binding proteins (PABP) bind eIF4G, leading to the circularization and activation of mRNAs (Fig. 1). The 43S preinitiation
complex [composed of the 40S ribosomal subunit, the eIF2
ternary complex (eIF2, GTP, and Met-tRNA), eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A,
and eIF5] joins the activated RNA structure (via eIF4G and eIF3
interaction) and scans 50 UTR until AUG start codon recognition occurs, followed by the hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and
the release of eIF2-bound GDP, eIF5, eIF3, and eIF1. The
subsequent association of the 60S ribosomal subunit with
eIF5B-bound GTP leads to eIF5B-mediated GTP hydrolysis
and the release of eIF5B-GDP and eIF1, thus allowing the
assembly of the 80S complex, which is then ready for translation elongation. Overexpression of eIF4E, a key player in capdependent translation, leads to oncogenic transformation (5),
and increased eIF4E protein levels are found in the majority of
human cancers, where its expression correlates with a poor
prognosis (6). In addition to the regulation of general protein
synthesis, studies have shown that eIF4E can also preferentially
enhance the translation of carcinogenesis-associated mRNAs,
including regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis,
and invasion (7–10). This suggests that targeting cap-dependent translation or eIF4E may be a promising strategy for
cancer treatment.

Translation Control in Response to Cancer
Stress
During cancer progression, cells are constantly exposed to
different types of stress. Rapid responses based on the accurate
expression of particular proteins may allow their further
growth and survival. Translation regulation is a rapid and

Translation as a Target in Cancer

elegant way of tuning gene expression by intensifying protein
synthesis from existing mRNAs while silencing others, and also
saves transcription-related energy. Thus, in the cancer situation, translational regulation may act to the advantage of
tumor cells.
Lack of oxygen (hypoxia), starvation, or response to DNAdamage inducing therapy represses cap-dependent translation
and leads to a reduction in overall protein synthesis, mostly by
suppression of eIF4F and eIF2 ternary complex assembly by
various mechanisms (11). On the other hand, inhibition of
protein synthesis allows the enhancement or activation of the
translation of mRNA subsets in a cap-independent manner
using secondary RNA structures termed internal ribosomal
entry sites (IRES), which are mostly located in the 50 UTR of
mRNA (12). Highly structured IRES bypass the conventional
scanning process by recruiting the 40S ribosome subunit and
other eIFs directly to the start codons or the 50 UTR region
independently of a cap. Of importance, these mRNAs encode
proteins with oncogenic activity that promote the development, progression, and survival of cancer cells, such as c-MYC
(13), lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)-1 (14), VEGF (15), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a (16), XIAP (17), and BCL2 (18).
In addition, IRES mutations or deregulated IRES-trans-acting factors (ITAF) can further increase the translation of
oncogenic proteins. In multiple myeloma, mutations in
c-myc-IRES were shown to enhance its translation initiation
(19), and a more recent study in the same cancer type (20)
showed an increase in IRES-dependent c-myc translation
via ITAFs such as Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) and
polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB-1), which were
previously reported to be involved in carcinogenesis and
chemotherapy resistance (21–24). These ﬁndings both show
the importance of IRES-driven carcinogenesis and have
therapeutic implications.
Translation initiation factor eIF4G was ﬁrst found to be
overexpressed in squamous cell lung carcinoma (25). eIF4G
recruits the 43S preinitiation complex to mRNA and is part of
the eIF4F complexes. Therefore, its oncogenic activity was
initially suggested to be very similar to that of eIF4E (26).
However, eIF4G was shown to transform NIH3T3 cells without
increasing the eIF4E level (27), and in a more recent study (28),
overexpression of eIF4GI in inﬂammatory breast cancer promoted the formation of tumor emboli by enhanced translation

of IRES-containing mRNAs, including catenin p120 mRNA.
Thus, depending on the circumstances, eIF4G can contribute
to oncogenic transformation either by forming active eIF4F
(required for cap-dependent translation) or by increasing
IRES-dependent translation. Furthermore, many components
of the human eIF3 factor [comprising 13 subunits (a–m)] are
deregulated in cancers. As reviewed recently (29), eIF3a, -c, and
-h are upregulated in human cancers, and individual overexpression of eIF3a, -b, -c, -h, or -i promoted malignant
transformation of NIH3T3 cells (30–32). In contrast, eIF3f is
downregulated in melanoma and pancreatic cancer, and its
overexpression inhibits proliferation and protein synthesis and
induces apoptosis (33). The murine Int-6 gene, encoding eIF3e,
was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (34, 35) that results in the production of a truncated
oncoprotein with transforming activity (36) capable of inducing cap-independent translation, as reported recently (37).
Several subsequent studies of full-length eIF3e showed its
tumor suppressor activity (38–40). However, further reports
indicated its oncogenic activity (41, 42), and a recent screen
identiﬁed eIF3e as a potential biomarker for the early detection
of breast cancer (43). Therefore, as suggested by a recent study
(44), eIF3e's involvement in carcinogenesis may depend on the
tumor type or stage, such that its downregulation may transform normal mammary cells and its upregulation may favor
the progression of malignant tumors. Nevertheless, in addition
to eIF3's important action in recruiting the 40S ribosome
subunit and the eIF2 ternary complex to mRNAs (in either a
cap-dependent or –independent manner), deregulation of eIF3
components (e.g., eIF3a, -e, or -h) can alter the synthesis of
speciﬁc cancer-related proteins and enhance resistance to
cancer therapy (42, 45, 46). However, how the speciﬁc eIF3
components regulate selective translation of oncogenic transcripts is not clear. Mass spectrometry analysis identiﬁed
phosphorylated subunits of eIF3 factor (a, b, c, f, g, h, and j)
in serum-stimulated HeLa cells, implying that it may be
possible to regulate them by phosphorylation (47). Furthermore, eIF3 subunits can interact with non-eIF proteins such as
IFN-induced protein p56, which binds eIF3e and suppresses
translation by inhibiting eIF3-mediated enhancement of ternary complex formation (48), or the tumor suppressor protein
schwannomin, which inhibits cellular proliferation through
direct interaction with eIF3c (49). Finally, eIF3 is a docking site

Figure 1. Targeting mRNA translation in cancer. During carcinogenesis, deregulated signaling pathways inﬂuence protein synthesis by modulating the
translation triggering different types of mRNAs. Activation of RTK signaling pathways, together with hyperactivated downstream oncogenic pathways such as
RAS, MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and PKC, activate the translational machinery via mTOR. Active mTORC1 enhances mRNA translation by the phosphorylation of
4EBPs, leading to release of eIF4E, the scaffold protein eIF4G, and the S6 kinases. Active S6K further phosphorylates S6 ribosomal protein and eIF4B,
and also inactivates both eEF2K (negative regulator of eEF2) and PDCD4, an inhibitor of the helicase activity of eIF4A. Activated by PI3K pathways and by
ribosome interaction, the mTORC2 complex phosphorylates and enhances AKT signaling and the PKC pathway. The TSC1/2 complex, which inhibits
mTORC1, is negatively regulated by AKT and MAPK/RSK1, and is activated by AMPK and GSK3, which also regulate eEF2K and eIF2B, respectively. eIF2B
facilitates the recycling of GDP to GTP on eIF2. eIF2-GTP and Met-tRNA form a ternary complex (eIF2TC), which together with the 40S ribosomal
subunit and other initiation factors further assembles the 43S preinitiation complex. This is recruited to eIF4F-bound mRNA (via eIF4G-eIF3), facilitating capdependent translation. Under conditions of stress and/or inhibition of eIF4F, a cap-independent mechanism of translation can operate via recruitment
of the 43S complex to the start codon by means of an IRES in the mRNA. Stimulation of MAPKs activates MNKs (via ERKs and p38), followed by
PKC-dependent MNK/eIF4G association and eIF4E phosphorylation leading to translation of speciﬁc mRNAs. Hypoxia or stress induces eIF2a
phosphorylation (via PERK, PKR, GCN2, or HRI), which suppresses GTP recycling on eIF2, causing inhibition of global protein synthesis and promoting
the translation of speciﬁc mRNAs that contain uORFs. Inhibitors of translation factors (or the signaling events that control them) that are used in clinical and
preclinical studies are summarized in the text.

for cancer-associated kinases such as mTOR (via eIF3f interaction), and activation of mTORC1 by insulin was shown to
increase the association of eIF3 and eIF4G factors (50). Active
and eIF3-associated mTORC1 phosphorylates and activates
S6K, followed by S6K dissociation from eIF3 factor and subsequent phosphorylation of S6K translational targets (51).
Together, these results suggest that eIF3 is an important
regulatory platform and a potential subject for the development of novel cancer treatments.
A further important mechanism that triggers selective
translation during the response of cancer cells to stress,
including hypoxia or chemotherapy, is part of the unfolded
protein response (UPR) during endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress (52). Phosphorylation of eIF2a by upstream kinases
blocks recycling of GTP on eIF2 by the guanine exchange
factor eIF2B and reduces global protein synthesis. This promotes the translation of mRNAs containing 50 UTR upstream
open reading frames (uORF) that are normally silenced for
translation. In human cancers, induced eIF2a phosphorylation
leads to the synthesis of basic leucine-zipper transcription
factors such as ATF4 (53) and ATF5 (54), which further support
cancer cell survival.
Translation can also be regulated via sequence-speciﬁc
noncoding microRNAs (miRNA), the expression of which is
very often deregulated in human cancers or is induced by
stress. Processed and mature miRNAs together with argonaute
protein and the glycine-tryptophan protein of 182 kDa
(GW182) make up the miRNA-induced silencing complex. This
complex base-pairs with a complementary sequence mostly in
the 30 UTR of mRNAs, leading to deadenylation or repression of
translation initiation or elongation and mRNA decay (55).
Although they are beyond the scope of this review, miRNAs
can undoubtedly control crucial steps in carcinogenesis, and
miRNA-based therapies have already shown promise for
cancer treatment (56). However, the mechanisms of
miRNA-mediated inhibition of cancer-related mRNA translation require further investigation.

Cancer Signaling Networks That Regulate
Protein Synthesis
The major hyperactivated signaling pathways that promote
carcinogenesis include growth factor signaling via activation of
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPK), RAS signaling, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
kinase (PI3K), and AKT signaling. In addition to transcription
activation, these pathways control protein synthesis by phosphorylation and the regulation of translation factors or ribosomal proteins. AKT signaling inactivates the tuberous sclerosis tumor-suppressor TSC1/2 complex, which negatively
regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1), a major regulator of protein synthesis that comprises mTOR, Raptor, and mLst8. In its active form, mTORC1
phosphorylates eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP), leading to the
release and activation of the cap-binding protein eIF4E (57–
59). Inactivation of 4E-BPs by downregulation or hyperphosphorylation correlates with higher tumor grades and reduced
patient survival in prostate (60) and breast (61) cancer, and
leads to an increase in cap-dependent translation (62). Nev-

ertheless, hypophosphorylation of 4E-BPs and the sequestering
of eIF4E can shift translation initiation toward cap-independent mechanisms that support the synthesis of proteins that
may be inﬂuential at certain stages of carcinogenesis. Thus,
4E-BPs and their phosphorylation status are crucial factors
that regulate the assembly of eIF4F and the type of translation
during carcinogenesis.
Active mTORC1 also supports global protein translation by
phosphorylating the scaffold protein eIF4G and the S6 kinase
(S6K) that regulates ribosomal protein S6 and eIF4B factor (63).
S6K also phosphorylates and inactivates eEF2 kinase (eEF2K),
which inhibits elongation factor eEF2, as well as translation
inhibitor programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), leading to its
proteasomal degradation (64). PDCD4 blocks RNA helicase
eIF4A activity, which allows the unwinding of highly structured
50 UTRs of cancer-promoting mRNAs, thus suppressing tumorigenesis and cancer progression (65, 66). In addition to regulating overall protein synthesis, mTORC1 can also increase the
translation of mRNAs with terminal oligopyrimidine tracts in
their 50 UTR that encode ribosomal proteins and translation
factors, thus supporting the translation of key components
required for protein synthesis (67, 68). mTOR pathways also
support ribosome biogenesis by regulating RNA polymerases
(Pol I and III) that generate ribosomal RNAs, and by inﬂuencing
rRNA processing (69, 70). Similarly, a recent study showed that
hyperactivated AKT cooperates with c-MYC and synergistically activates rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis,
highlighting AKT/mTORC1 and c-MYC as an important
growth-regulating network (71). In cancer, the activation of
mTORC1 can also be supported by MAPKs that act downstream of hyperactivated RTKs and RAS pathways. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) can phosphorylate and
inhibit tuberin (TSC2) directly (72) or via activation of RSK
kinase (p90RSK), which further phosphorylates and impairs
TSC2 function (73) and additionally stimulates mTORC1 activity via direct raptor phosphorylation (74). RSKs can also
support protein synthesis in a manner very similar to that
observed for S6K by phosphorylating and regulating IF4B (75)
and eEF2K (76).
On the other hand, the activation of mTORC1 can be
inhibited by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major
sensor of the energy status that induces the activity of the
mTORC1 negative regulator TSC1/2 complex (77). AMPKmediated phosphorylation and activation of TSC2 are strongly
supported by active GSK3 (78), which is negatively regulated by
AKT (79) and other oncogenic pathways, including MAPK,
PKC, and Wnt signaling (80). In addition to mTORC1 inhibition, activated GSK3 inhibits the initiation factor eIF2B (81),
whereas active AMPK can suppress elongation factor eEF2 via
eEF2K, leading to a decrease in global protein synthesis and
cell-cycle arrest (82, 83). In human cancers, suppression of
AMPK activity is maintained by hyperactivated AKT, which
phosphorylates the AMPKa subunit and inhibits its activation
via AMPK-upstream kinase LKB1 (84). Heterozygous loss of
LKB1 function increases the risk of malignant cancers, and loss
of the STK11 (LKB1) gene is very frequent in lung and cervical
cancers (85). Furthermore, in a recent study, AMPK activators
(metformin, phenformin, and A-769662) were found to

Translation as a Target in Cancer

suppress tumorigenesis in PTEN-deﬁcient mice (86), suggesting AMPK pathway reactivation as a potential strategy for
cancer treatment. Metformin and phenformin impair mitochondrial respiration, leading to an increase in the cellular
AMP:ATP ratio that activates AMPK (87), whereas A-769662
can directly bind and activate AMPK by mimicking AMP and
inhibiting AMPK dephosphorylation (88).
The activated mTORC2 complex composed of mTOR, Rictor,
Protor, mLst8, and Sin1 (59) can further enhance AGC kinase
activity by phosphorylating AKT and PKC hydrophobic and
turn motifs in a Sin1-dependent manner (89). A recent study in
yeast, followed by validation experiments in cancer cells,
showed that mTORC2 activation via the PI3K pathway after
insulin stimulation requires association with ribosomes, thus
leading to mTORC2 activity only in growing cells with a high
level of ribosome biogenesis (90). Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that the hyperactivated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling network inﬂuences tumor growth by its effects on crucial
steps of protein synthesis in highly proliferating cancer cells.
Although carcinogenesis is promoted by the activation of
growth pathways, at certain stages of cancer development,
further tumor progression or the survival of cancer cells
depends on the synthesis of a subset of proteins whose
expression is very often controlled by translation. MAPK
interacting kinases (MNK1/2), regulated by upstream ERKs
and p38 kinases, bind to eIF4G and phosphorylate eIF4E (91). A
recent report showed that phosphorylation of eIF4G1 by PKCa
is required for MNK1 binding to eIF4G1, indicating a link
between PKC activity and EIF4E phosphorylation (92). The
PKC kinase family can also support protein synthesis via
phosphorylation of AKT and MAPK, and by inactivation of
GSK3 (93). Of importance, eIF4E phosphorylation at serine-209
by MNKs was shown to be required for eIF4E oncogenic
activity in vivo (94), and an increase in phospho-eIF4E has
been reported in various cancers (95). The role of eIF4E
phosphorylation in regulating translation is not clear. One
study suggested a model in which eIF4E phosphorylation can
occur as a transient event during translation initiation (96).
After assembly of the eIF4F complex, phosphorylation of eIF4E
weakens its afﬁnity for capped RNA, allowing for the release of
eIF4F from the 50 UTR-end of the mRNA and enhancing RNA
unwinding and ribosome migration. In addition to translation
initiation, other studies indicate a role for eIF4E in the nucleus,
where phosphorylated eIF4E promotes the transport of
growth-supporting mRNAs such as cyclin D or HDM2 and
thus contributes to oncogenic transformation (97, 98). Nevertheless, mice lacking both MNK1 and MNK2 develop normally
without detectable eIF4E phosphorylation, indicating that the
MNK/eIF4E pathway is not required for global protein synthesis (99) but may be important in conditions such as stress or
cancer. Indeed, MNK1 activation can be induced by different
types of stress, including radiation, whereas MNK2 shows
much higher basic activity in comparison with MNK1 (91).
A previous study (100) suggested a MNK-induced, cap-independent translation in which the MNK/eIF4E pathway negatively regulates cap-dependent protein synthesis, thereby
enhancing the availability of initiation complexes for capindependent mechanisms of translation. In addition, recent

www.aacrjournals.org

studies showed that downstream MNK pathways enhance the
translation of speciﬁc mRNAs involved in carcinogenesis,
including MCL1 (94), CCL2/7, MMP3/7 (10), and SMAD2
(101). Thus, the activation of MNKs may represent a survival
pathway that is hyperactivated in cancers.
Malignant progression leads to various cancer stresses (e.g.,
hypoxia) that induce the activation of eIF2a kinases such as dsRNA–dependent protein kinase (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic
reticulum kinase (PERK), general control nonderepressible 2
(GCN2), and heme-regulated inhibitor [HRI (102, 103)]. In a
recent study, hyperactivated AKT inhibited PERK-mediated
eIF2a phosphorylation and maintained eIF2a in an unphosphorylated state in proliferating cancer cells (104). Phosphorylated eIF2a inhibits global protein synthesis and reduces
cancer cell proliferation, but it also activates a survival mechanism via regulation of translation. Therefore, eIF2 phosphorylation appears to play a role in the acquisition of a malignant
phenotype by enhancing the translation of speciﬁc proteins
that promote the survival and adaptation of cancer cells to
stress conditions at the expense of global protein synthesis and
proliferation.

Targeting Deregulated Translation in Cancer
In the past decade, the blocking of deregulated signaling
pathways by kinase inhibitors has shown great promise for
cancer treatment. In this review, we concentrate on targeting
kinases that directly and extensively regulate translation factors and protein synthesis.
mTORC1 can be inhibited by rapalogs (rapamycin and its
derivatives) that bind to FKBP-12 and inhibit mTOR in complex 1. Although mTORC2 was thought to be insensitive,
decreased mTORC2 activity after extended rapalog treatment
has been reported (105, 106). In many preclinical and clinical
studies, rapalogs were shown to inhibit tumor growth, vascularization, invasion, and metastasis by reducing global protein
synthesis, as well as by inhibiting mTORC1-speciﬁc mRNA
translation, including cyclin D, c-MYC, and HIF-1a (107).
Although rapalogs have shown promising antitumor effects,
many cancers become resistant to treatment because of mutations in FKBP-12 (108) or an increase in the activity of
compensatory or survival pathways. Rapalog-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 induces the activation of AKT via suppression of an inhibitory effect of S6K on IRS1, which normally
activates the PI3K/AKT pathway (109). In addition, the rapalog-insensitive mTORC2 complex phosphorylates the AKT
hydrophobic motif and further enhances AKT activity. In an
attempt to overcome resistance pathways, investigators have
developed mTORC1/2 inhibitors (e.g., PP242, WYE-132, Torin1,
AZD8055, OSI-027, and INK128) and inhibitors targeting
mTORC1/2 and PI3K (e.g., PI-103, NVP-BEZ235, WJD008, and
GSK2126458), and these agents have shown antitumor activity
superior to that of rapalogs in various in vivo and in vitro cancer
models, including lymphoma, leukemia, glioma, breast, lung,
and renal carcinoma (110–119). mTORC1/2 inhibitors (e.g.,
PP242) were more efﬁcient in the inhibition of global protein
synthesis and in eIF4F complex formation than rapamycin,
illustrating the more-effective approach of targeting cap-

dependent translation in cancer (120). It is worth mentioning
that inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR by PI-103 and rapamycin
was more effective against malignant melanoma compared
with a single-agent treatment, indicating that "vertical inhibition" is a promising strategy to improve therapeutic
approaches (121). Rapalogs can also enhance MNK-regulated
eIF4E phosphorylation in a PI3K-dependent manner (122).
Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of MNK pathways by
CGP57380 sensitized cancer cells to rapalogs and showed
signiﬁcantly stronger effects than a single drug treatment
(101, 123, 124). More recently, in xenograft tumor models,
MNK1-depleted glioma cells showed a decrease in tumor
formation (125), and the MNK inhibitor cercosporamide
(126) suppressed the outgrowth of melanoma pulmonary
metastases and colon carcinoma growth. Thus, targeting
MNK-controlled translational pathways may have potential
as an effective cancer therapy.
As an alternative to the inhibition of signaling pathways,
therapeutic approaches that interfere with the deregulated
translation typical of some cancers have been studied. Treatment with eIF4E-speciﬁc antisense oligonucleotides reduced
eIF4E expression as well as eIF4E-regulated proteins, and
suppressed tumor growth in nude mice bearing human breast
and prostate tumor xenografts (127). Although eIF4E is a
general initiation factor required for cap-dependent translation, the reduction of eIF4E expression appeared to have no
effect on normal tissues, suggesting that cancer tissues are
more susceptible to eIF4E inhibition than normal tissues.
Sequestering of eIF4E by a physical mimic of the m7G cap
structure ribavirin (128) induced the reduction and relocalization of nuclear eIF4E to the cytoplasm, and this was associated
with a clinical response in patients with myeloid leukemia
(129). Furthermore, a synthetic peptide (eIF4GI-1) that disrupts eIF4E/eIF4G association inhibited cap-dependent translation, enhanced eIF4E association with 4E-BP1, and reduced
protein levels of c-MYC and Bcl-xL, showing a preferential
effect on transformed cells, including lymphoma and lung
cancer cells (130). Another compound that inhibits the cap
complex is the antiproliferative and proapoptotic marine
natural product pateamine A, which targets eIF4A and stimulates its RNA binding. This results in sequestration of eIF4A
onto RNA and a reduction in eIF4A's availability to recycle
through the eIF4F complex (131). More recently, des-methyl,
des-amino pateamine A (DMDA-PatA) showed potent anticancer activity in a melanoma mouse model and low cytotoxicity against nonproliferating human ﬁbroblasts (132). Similarly, silvestrol inhibited translation initiation and ribosome
recruitment by targeting eIF4A and interfering with eIF4F
complex formation (133). Silvestrol has exhibited anticancer
activity in mouse cancer models, including breast and prostate
cancer (133) and B-cell leukemias (134). Furthermore, hippur-

istanol, a selective and potent inhibitor of eIF4A RNA-binding
activity (135), showed anticancer activity in an adult T-cell
leukemia mouse model (136).
The translation factor eIF5A requires speciﬁc posttranslational modiﬁcation (hypusination) for full functionality. N1guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7) and ciclopirox olamine
(CPX) are potent inhibitors of deoxyhypusine synthase, which
catalyzes eIF5A hypusination. GC7 and CPX have shown antiproliferative effects in various cell lines (137, 138) and antitumor activity in vivo in breast cancer, melanoma, leukemia, and
myeloma models (139–141).

Conclusions
Deregulated translation not only allows an increase in
protein synthesis in cancer cells and thus further growth, it
also enhances the synthesis of proteins that are advantageous
for the survival of tumor tissues and their adaptation to
environmental changes during disease progression and
response to therapy. Further study of translation regulation
in cancer will undoubtedly uncover novel potential therapeutic
targets. Mechanisms that drive selective translation of speciﬁc
mRNAs also warrant further investigation, especially in deﬁned
types and stages of cancer. Clearly, deregulated signaling networks in cancer regulate translation, and many novel phosphosites that have been identiﬁed in proteomics-based screens
await further characterization (47, 142). Additionally, the analysis of other posttranslational modiﬁcations in the translational machinery may reveal novel regulatory mechanisms that
are suitable as targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, because rapid regulation of translation can enhance
resistance to many cancer treatments, targeting translationbased survival mechanisms in combination with already
approved compounds or with standard-of-care therapy may
substantially improve the success of cancer treatments.
