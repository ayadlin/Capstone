BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a significant side effect of taxane and platinum-based chemotherapy. Several studies have supported the potential benefit of glutathione for the prevention of platinum-induced CIPN. The current trial was designed to determine whether glutathione would prevent CIPN as a result of carboplatin/paclitaxel therapy.
METHODS: In total, 185 patients who received treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin were accrued between December 4, 2009
and December 19, 2011. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n 5 91) or 1.5 g/m2 glutathione (n 5 94) over 15 minutes
immediately before chemotherapy. CIPN was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
Quality-of-Life (EORTC-QLQ) 20-item, CIPN-specific (CIPN20) sensory subscale and the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 2
study arms with regard to: 1) peripheral neurotoxicity, as assessed using both the EORTC-QLQ-CIPN20 (P 5.21) and the CTCAE scales
(P 5.449 for grade 2 neurotoxicity; P 5.039 for time to development of grade 2 neuropathy, in favor of the placebo); 2) the degree
of paclitaxel acute pain syndrome (P 5.30 for patients who received paclitaxel every 3-4 weeks and P 5.002, in favor of the placebo,
for patients who received weekly paclitaxel); 3) the time to disease progression (P 5.63); or 4) apparent toxicities. Subgroup analyses
did not reveal any evidence of benefit in any particular subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study do not support the

INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a significant chemotherapy side effect that manifests as numbness, tingling, and/or pain, generally beginning in the hands and/or feet with proximal progression in a “stocking-andglove” manner.1,2 It is common with platinum-based agents (eg, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin [CBDCA]), vinca
alkaloids, taxanes, and other agents,3 with an estimated incidence of 30% to 40%.2-6 CIPN can significantly impact
patient quality of life; it may lead to dose reductions, dose delays, and/or early termination of chemotherapy. Because there
are limited options available to effectively treat CIPN once it is established, efforts have been made to study means to prevent the development of CIPN.

Glutathione for Prevention of CIPN/Leal et al

Glutathione is a naturally occurring compound consisting of 3 amino acids: glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine; it is an important scavenger molecule that
participates in many detoxification reactions to protect
the body from intracellular oxidants such as free radicals
and reactive oxygen species. It is believed that platinuminduced neurotoxicity is secondary to the accumulation of
platinum within the dorsal root ganglion.7,8 Glutathione
is a nontoxic agent that has been shown to reduce the
accumulation of platinum within the dorsal root ganglion,9 supporting the possibility that this may provide an
underlying mechanism to prevent neurotoxicity.
Multiple previous studies have investigated the efficacy of glutathione for the prevention of CIPN. One
small, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving 33
patients reported that the regimen was safe, although there
were minimal changes in sensory neuropathy.10 Another
placebo-controlled, randomized trial11 involving 33
patients with relapsed ovarian cancer reported that higher
cisplatin doses could be administered with glutathione.
Cascinu et al12 performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial evaluating the ability of glutathione to prevent CIPN in a cohort of 50 patients with
gastric cancer who were receiving a cisplatin-based regimen and reported a decreased incidence of neuropathy in
the glutathione arm. Cascinu et al13 performed a second
small (n 5 52), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of glutathione for the
prevention of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy
in a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer; that trial
also produced results that appeared to be promising. Similar findings were observed by Milla et al14 (n 5 27) in
patients who were receiving combined oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX4). Smyth et al15 conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study in 151 patients who were receiving cisplatin and
reported numerically reduced neurotoxicity among those
who received glutathione (P 5 .22). Lin et al16 reported a
small trial in 14 patients who were receiving adjuvant
FOLFOX and were randomized to receive either 1200 mg
of oral N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione precursor, or placebo; and a reduced incidence of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy was observed among those who received
N-acetylcysteine. Further evidence to support the role of
glutathione in the reduction of neurotoxicity was reported
by Periera et al,17 who observed that neuronal glutamate
toxicity was secondary to the inhibition of cysteine uptake
and, thus, depletion of glutathione stores and resulting
oxidative stress/damage. Pursuant to this extensive body
of preliminary data, the current study was developed to

evaluate the efficacy of glutathione for preventing CIPN
in a cohort of patients who were receiving paclitaxel/
CBDCA chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients who were considered for this trial were adults
scheduled to receive paclitaxel at doses from 150 to 200
mg/m2 and CBDCA at an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) from 5 to 7 every 21 or 28 days for at
least 12 weeks. Alternatively, paclitaxel could be prescribed at 80 mg/m2 weekly for at least 12 weeks with the
same CBDCA dose and schedule. Patients had to have an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(PS) of 0 to 2 and a life expectancy of at least 6 months.
Baseline laboratory values (including a white blood cell
count 3.4 3 109/L, an absolute neutrophil count
1500/lL, platelets 100 3 109/L, hemoglobin 10.0
g/dL, and creatinine 1.5 times the upper normal limit)
were required. Each participant signed an institutional
review board-approved, protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with US federal and institutional
guidelines.
Patients were excluded from study participation for
1) a pre-existing history of peripheral neuropathy greater
than grade 1 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] version
4.0) from any cause (chemotherapy, diabetes, alcohol,
toxin, hereditary, etc); 2) other medical conditions that
would make study participation unreasonably hazardous;
3) prior receipt of paclitaxel and/or CBDCA chemotherapy treatment; or 4) concurrent use of any agents to try to
prevent or treat neuropathy, including gabapentin, glutamine, vitamin B6, and vitamin E.
At study baseline and before each cycle of chemotherapy, patients were required to undergo a history and
physical examination with laboratory evaluation (including a complete blood count and creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels). Procedures for
measuring CIPN were performed at baseline and 1 week
after each dose of chemotherapy. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-ofLife (EORTC-QLQ) CIPN20, which was used to measure the primary endpoint in this clinical trial, is a 20item, CIPN-specific, patient-reported outcome questionnaire that includes 3 subscales to assess sensory, motor,
and autonomic symptoms and functioning, with each
item measured on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very
much). This questionnaire can be completed in 5 minutes
or less and has been well received in previous clinical trials.
In addition, NCI CTCAE version 4.0 was used to

quantify the chronic neurotoxicity associated with chemotherapy using standardized questions regarding neurotoxic symptoms and examples of answers (Table 1) to
allow a more accurate classification of patient symptoms
as grade 1, 2, or 3. Symptoms of paclitaxel-associated
acute pain syndrome were measured by asking patients to
keep a daily symptom log on days 2 through 7 after each
paclitaxel dose with a tool used to define this
syndrome.18,19

recovered to a CTCAE toxicity grade 2, then treatment
was resumed at a 10% dose reduction. Modification or
discontinuation of CBDCA because of neurotoxicity was
at the discretion of the clinician. If CBDCA was discontinued but paclitaxel was continued, then the patient continued glutathione/placebo therapy. If a patient
developed any clinically significant adverse event (AE)
attributed to glutathione/placebo, then the glutathione/
placebo was stopped. In the event that glutathione/placebo was stopped for an AE, the patient continued to be
followed according to protocol criteria. If the patient
required additional chemotherapeutic agents because of
chemotherapy toxicity and/or disease progression, then
the patient was taken off study treatment.

Protocol Treatment

For this clinical trial, a single-stage, parallel group design
was used. The dynamic allocation procedure21 to balance
the marginal distributions of baseline neuropathy,
debulked status, and cancer type was adopted for
randomization.
The primary endpoint was sensory chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy as measured repeatedly by
the sensory subscale of the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 during the first 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The EORTC
QLQ-CIPN20 sensory subscale score was computed by
using a standard scoring algorithm and then converting
scores to a scale from 0 to 100, in which higher scores
indicated less symptoms and better quality of life. A
repeated-measures model was used to compare the

Patients received glutathione 1.5g/m2 or placebo (100 mL
of 0.9% NaCl) intravenously over 15 minutes immediately before chemotherapy. Ideally, patients were to begin
glutathione before their first dose of this chemotherapy,
but they were required to begin before their second dose
of chemotherapy. Glutathione was obtained from Biomedica Foscarna (Ferentino, Italy), a company that makes
the product that was used in the positive studies conducted by Cascinu et al.12,13 It was reconstituted from
glutathione sodium salt (equivalent to 600 mg glutathione) with sterile water.
In the event that a patient developed a CTCAE neurotoxicity grade 3, paclitaxel was held until the patient

inflated by 20% to account for patient ineligibility, cancellation, or major violations.
This trial was monitored at least twice annually by a
Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which was composed
of individuals from within and outside the Alliance for
Clinical Trials in Oncology. Data collection and statistical
analyses were conducted by the Alliance Statistics and
Data Center. Data quality was ensured through a review
of data by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center and by
the study chairperson, according to Alliance policies. All
analyses were based on the study database, which was frozen on January 22, 2013.

This study accrued 195 patients between December 4,
2009 and December 19, 2011 from over 50 individual
sites. Baseline patient characteristics, as detailed in Table
2, were similar in the 2 treatment groups. Patient study
flow is illustrated in Figure 1.
Neuropathy Data
Paclitaxel acute pain syndrome data

Data on patient-reported acute pain syndrome, which has
been described as primarily a manifestation of acute paclitaxel neuropathy18,19 but commonly has been labeled as
paclitaxel-induced arthralgia/myalgia, are illustrated in
Figure 2. The figure illustrates that, for 7 days after each
chemotherapy dose, there was no significant advantage for
glutathione between the 2 study arms (P 5 .30 for the
every-3-week subset vs P 5 .002 for the weekly subset, in
favor of the placebo arm).
Cumulative peripheral neurotoxicity

The data presented regarding peripheral neuropathy
include the patients who received paclitaxel weekly and
those who received it every 3 weeks, because the data were
quite similar in these 2 subsets. Peripheral neuropathy
data for the 2 study arms, as scored using the QLQCIPN20 sensory neuropathy scale (primary endpoint)
(Fig. 3), illustrate that there were no statistically significant differences in the AUC between the 2 study arms
(P 5 .21). The median follow-up for these patients was
326 days.
In addition, no significant benefits for glutathione
were observed when neurotoxicity was assessed by physicians using the CTCAE scale for determining grade 2

neurotoxicity (P 5 .449) or the time to the development
of grade 2 neurotoxicity (P 5 .039, in favor of the placebo arm) (Table 3, Fig. 4). FACT-O data evaluating
changes from baseline values did not reveal any substantial
difference between the 2 study arms.
Effect of Glutathione on Cancer Outcome

There were no significant differences between the 2 study
arms with regard to the time to disease progression in the
gynecologic patients according to carbohydrate antigen
125 (CA 125)-determined disease progression, defined as a
CA 125 elevation >2 times the upper limit of normal on 2
occasions, separated by at least 1 week, when the level had
normalized during therapy or upon completion of therapy.
Evaluation of Glutathione Toxicity

There were no statistically significant or clinically apparent differences in toxicity between the 2 study arms with
regard to multiple evaluated toxicities (including fatigue,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, anaphylaxis, anemia,
and leukopenia).
Subgroup Analyses

Subgroup analyses by age, sex, tumor type, and specific
paclitaxel regimens revealed no compelling evidence of
benefit in any subgroup.
1894

DISCUSSION
The negative findings from the current trial contrast
with the positive pilot findings10-17 that led to its development. Of the data available to investigate the efficacy
of glutathione as a CIPN-preventative agent, most studies were conducted in patients who were receiving either
oxaliplatin-based or cisplatin-based therapy. In comparing the neurotoxicity of the agents involved in the current trial, CBDCA is the least neurotoxic of the
platinum agents and is less neurotoxic than paclitaxel.
Although the current results support the finding that
glutathione is not an effective agent in the prevention of
taxane-induced CIPN when given in combination with
CBDCA, these results may not be applicable for
cisplatin-induced or oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity.
A recently published study by Smith et al26 supports
the view that therapies for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy may be different for different chemotherapy
agents. Their report included data from a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial that
investigated the efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of
established CIPN in a cohort of patients with either
taxane-induced or oxaliplatin-induced CIPN. Those
authors observed a significant decrease in patient-reported
average pain among those who received duloxetine

compared with those who received placebo. However, in a
subgroup analysis, it appeared that duloxetine was efficacious in patients with oxaliplatin-induced CIPN but not
in those with taxane-induced CIPN. This may explain the
differences between our current findings and the findings
reported previously in other pilot trials that examined
oxaliplatin-based or cisplatin-based therapies.
Despite substantial efforts, currently, there are no
recommended agents for preventing chemotherapyinduced neuropathy. A recent large trial illustrated that intravenous calcium/magnesium was not helpful for
oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy27 despite substantial previous enthusiasm for this approach. Similarly, despite
pilot reports suggesting the utility of vitamin E, a larger,
placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial was
not able to substantiate a benefit.28 Acetyl-L-carnitine, despite preliminary reports and supporting animal tumor
data, actually appeared to worsen CIPN in patients who

demonstrated no benefit for an adrenocorticotropic hormone derivative30,31 despite 4 smaller pilot trials that suggested a benefit.32-35
Although this series of negative trials is disappointing, so is the substantial neuropathy caused by commonly
used neurotoxic chemotherapy agents. This calls for
ongoing scientific methods to identify ways of using these
agents for their antitumor activity while preventing
unwanted neuropathy.
Along this line, we are excited about the potential utility of minocycline36-53 and selective serotonin

and duloxetine.26 Efforts are ongoing to address the potential utility of these agents. In addition, work is being done to
address the role of genetic factors as a means of identifying
which patients are at increased risk for developing CIPN.
In conclusion, the results from this study do not support the use of glutathione for the prevention of taxaneinduced CIPN. There was no suggestion of glutathioneassociated toxicity or interference with antitumor activity.
Further inquiries into the efficacy of this drug in patients
who are receiving oxaliplatin-based or cisplatin-based
therapy would be of interest.
