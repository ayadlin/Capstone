effect of VPA on tumor cells differs according to cell type, degree of differentiation, and underlying genetic alterations. Clinical trials with VPA have focused on
acute myeloid leukemia and the myelodysplastic syndromes. When it was used
as monotherapy or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid, which synergizes
in vitro, VPA achieved hematologic improvement in a subset of patients. Similar
to other inhibitors of histone deacetylases, complete or partial remissions rarely
were observed. In this report, the authors reviewed the in vitro and in vivo data
obtained with VPA, and they considered possible combination regimens aimed
at improving therapeutic efficacy. Cancer 2007;110:943–54.  2007 American

alproic acid (VPA) has been used as an anticonvulsant for decades. It suppresses generalized and partial seizures, acts as a
mood stabilizer, and augments the treatment of migraine and neuropathic pain.1 Recently, cancer treatment has become a new sphere of
application for VPA. Similar to other short-chain fatty acids (SCFA),
VPA affects the growth and differentiation of a variety of malignant
cells in vitro.2 In vitro anticancer activity of VPA was detected more
than 10 years ago. Similar to teratogenicity, the antitumor effect is independent of the drug’s antiepileptic activity because VPA can be
modified to exhibit either one effect or the other.3 Antineoplastic activity includes an effect on the cell cycle through prolongation of the
G1 phase.4 VPA also has a differentiating effect, for example, as
shown in neuroblastoma cells, in which it causes increased expression of neural adhesion molecules, decreased expression of n-myc
oncoprotein, and morphologic alterations such as neuritogenesis. In
addition, VPA affects the cytoskeleton,5 inhibiting cell motility and
tumor metastasis, and demonstrates antiangiogenic activity in vitro.6
For a comprehensive review of these earlier studies, see Blaheta
et al.2 It was not discovered until 2001 that the antineoplastic and teratogenic effects depend mainly on the inhibitory action of VPA on
histone deacetylase (HDAC).7,8
HDACs, together with histone acetyltransferases (HAT), are
involved in chromatin modification, which plays a crucial role in the
regulation of gene transcription. The addition of charge-neutralizing
acetyl groups to lysine residues disrupts DNA-histone interaction,

resulting in a more open DNA conformation and a
transcriptionally active state. It is hypothesized that,
by this mechanism, HDAC inhibitors achieve derepression of silenced tumor suppressor genes.9 The discovery that tumor cell differentiation induced by VPA is
coupled with the drug’s capability to inhibit HDAC
instigated a number of preclinical studies and clinical
trials, with a focus on acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

Chemistry and Pharmacologic Properties
VPA was synthesized in 1882, but it was not until
1967 that its anticonvulsant properties were detected.
This discovery occurred incidentally in a clinical trial
in which VPA was used only as a lipophilic vehicle
but showed an anticonvulsive effect in the control
group.1
VPA (di-n-propylacetic acid) is an SCFA with a
small volume of distribution (0.13–0.19 L/kg) attributable to a high degree of ionization at physiologic
pH that renders the drug less lipid-soluble than other
anticonvulsants. Oral bioavailability is nearly 100%. If
needed, the drug also can be administered intravenously. The plasma half-life of VPA is from 9 to 18
hours, and its protein binding is from 80% to 95%.
VPA interacts with other drugs at the level of protein
binding and drug metabolism.
Because of the drug’s multiple effects and the
observation that anticonvulsant activity increases after prolonged treatment, there has been much speculation regarding whether VPA acts through more than
1 mechanism. The best pieces of evidence indicate
that the inhibitory neurotransmitter g-aminobutyric
acid is involved, because VPA causes increased
plasma levels and enhanced synthesis and release in
specific brain regions. VPA also appears to reduce
the release of the epileptogenic amino acid g-hydroxybutyric acid. In addition, VPA exerts direct effects
on excitable membranes.1
Generally, VPA is well tolerated. Neurologic side
effects such as sedation, dizziness, and tremor as
well as mild gastrointestinal toxicities usually occur
early during treatment. The most serious adverse
events are liver failure and teratogenicity. Fatal hepatotoxicity is rare (approximately 1:15.000) and mainly
occurs in children aged <2 years who are treated
with multiple drugs. Teratogenicity manifests itself as
neural-tube defects with a frequency of 1% to 2%.
The teratogenic and anticonvulsive effects can be
ascribed to different structural elements of the substance. Teratogenic action requires a specific structure, including a free carboxyl group, and a carbon
atom number 2 binding a hydrogen atom and 2 alkyl

groups with 3 carbon atoms each.1 Mainly, if it is
used at relatively high serum levels (>100 lg/mL),
then VPA can cause hematologic toxicity. Pancytopenia, severe bone marrow failure, myelodysplasia, and
a clinical picture resembling acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL) have been reported.10 In most
patients, dose reduction was sufficient to reverse
these side effects.

Preclinical Studies of HDAC Inhibition by VPA
In 2001, 2 independent groups published observations
on HDAC inhibition by VPA. Phiel et al. observed that
VPA activates Wnt-dependent gene expression through
inhibition of HDAC, leading to increased b-catenin
expression and derepression of Tcf/Lef.8
Gottlicher et al.7 demonstrated that VPA relieves
the effect of several transcriptional repressors, causes
hyperacetylation of cells in vitro and in vivo, and
inhibits nuclear receptor corepressor-associated
HDAC activity at a concentration of 0.5 mM. In an
MT-450 rat breast cancer model VPA delayed the
growth of primary tumors and reduced the frequency
and size of metastases. With regard to hematopoietic
cells, VPA induced differentiation and apoptosis in
AML cell lines and fresh leukemic blasts, synergized
with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in this regard, but
did not significantly affect the viability of normal hematopoietic stem cells. It also was noted that VPA
preferentially inhibits Class I HDACs. In a later study,
the same group reported that VPA, in addition to
selectively inhibiting the catalytic activity of Class I
HDACs, induces proteasomal degradation of HDAC2,
which is in contrast to other inhibitors.11
HDAC inhibition as a cause of the effect of VPA
on tumor cells was elucidated further by Gurvich
et al.,12 who examined the HDAC-inhibitory activity
of different VPA analogs by measuring acetylation of
core histones H3 and H4 in leukemic cell lines. VPA
inhibits Class I HDACs 1 through 3 and Class II
HDACs 4, 5, and 7 whereas, in contrast to trichostatin-A (TSA), Class II HDACs 6 and 10 are not inhibited. Of the VPA analogs that were tested, VPA itself
showed the greatest potency whereas valpromide, an
analog with antiepileptic but no antineoplastic potency, had the smallest. In the same order that VPA
analogs effected histone acetylation, they also
induced cellular differentiation as well as expression
of simian virus 40, p21, and gelsolin. P21 was needed
for VPA-induced differentiation, because U937 cells
that lacked p21 did not express the differentiation
marker CD11b in response to treatment.
Another effect of VPA relates to the expression of
genes that regulate chromatin structure.13 In addition

Valproic Acid in Myeloid Malignancies/Kuendgen and Gattermann

to inducing rapid hyperacetylation of histones H3
and H4, VPA also caused depletion of structural
maintenance of chromatin (SMC) proteins, SMCassociated proteins, DNA methyltransferase, and heterochromatin proteins, resulting in chromatin decondensation. This was associated with enhanced
sensitivity of DNA to nucleases and increased interaction with intercalating agents.
An effect of HDAC inhibitors on the pattern of
HDAC expression may influence response to cytotoxic treatment.14 In a study on AML blasts and
healthy, CD34-positive progenitors, all 4 HDAC inhibitors that were tested (TSA, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [SAHA], butyrate, and VPA) caused
dysregulation of HDAC expression but produced different patterns. Only the expression of HDAC11 and,
to a lesser extent, SIRT-4 was increased consistently
by all 4 drugs. HDAC9 was induced strongly only by
VPA. Conversely, early induction (from 15 minutes to
1 hour) of HDAC11 only occurred with TSA and
SAHA.
Preliminary data exist on the influence of VPA on
acetylation of nonhistone proteins in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines, in which acetylation
of at least 22 proteins, most of them cytoplasmic,
was regulated by VPA. This included 2 chaperones as
well as proteins involved in the synthesis and stability of RNA.15

VPA-induced growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis
Several workers investigated how VPA induces differentiation and apoptosis and reported that the effects
depend on the level of differentiation and the underlying genetic alterations. Kawagoe et al.16 observed
the induction of apoptosis in several leukemic cell
lines representing pre-B, T-lymphoid, and myeloid
cells. The 2 cell lines that were most sensitive to VPA
both carried the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene
anomaly. VPA induced apoptosis through 2 different
pathways, namely, a caspase-dependent pathway
with drug-activated caspases 8, 9, and 3 and another,
caspase-independent pathway.
In 32D cells transformed by BCR/ABL and FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication
(FLT3-ITD), different pathways are involved in the
induction of apoptosis by combined VPA and ATRA
(VPA1ATRA).17 In Philadelphia chromosome (Pa)positive cells, VPA1ATRA stimulated apoptosis, which
was caspase-dependent but was independent of Akt
pathway inhibition. Conversely, VPA1ATRA did not
induce apoptosis in FLT3-ITD cells. In these cells,
additional blockage of Akt-mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTor) signaling was essential for overcoming apoptosis resistance, and induction of apo-

945

ptosis was caspase-independent. Regarding primary
leukemic cells, VPA1ATRA induced considerably more
apoptosis in Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia
(ALL) cells than in BCR/ABL-negative AML samples.
It was possible to overcome the resistance of AML
blasts by combination treatment with the mTor inhibitor rapamycin.
The selective antitumor effect of VPA and other
HDAC inhibitors appears to involve apoptosis upon
activation of the death receptor pathway.18 Mice with
promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor a
(PML-RARa)-induced leukemia survived significantly
longer when they were treated with VPA. Massive
apoptosis was observed in the bone marrow and
spleen. Healthy mice, in contrast, showed increased
histone acetylation in response to VPA but no effect
on apoptosis or survival. The more potent but less
specific HDAC inhibitor TSA had effects similar to
those of VPA in vitro. In vivo, however, TSA induced
the up-regulation of Fas, but not tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and
caused less apoptosis. VPA induced the up-regulation
of TRAIL, death receptor 5, Fas ligand, and Fas in
leukemic cells, correlating with initiation of the caspase cascade and induction of apoptosis both in
vitro and in vivo. These effects were not observed in
preleukemic or normal cells. Results similar to PMLRAR-induced leukemia were reported in mouse leukemias that expressed the AML 8;21 fusion protein
AML1-ETO. In fresh leukemic blasts from patients
who had AML that did not express PML-RAR or
AML1-ETO, sensitivity to VPA treatment (1 mM) was
observed in 17 of 25 samples. Tumor-selective induction of the death receptor pathway may provide a
mechanistic explanation for the selective toxicity of
HDACs.
VPA inhibits the proliferation of leukemic cells
regardless of their expression of p-glycoprotein and
multidrug resistance associated protein-1. Whereas
VPA induced apoptosis in K562 cells, producing a
decrease in caspase 8 (FLICE)-inhibitory protein
expression, the HL60/MRP cell line demonstrated
resistance to VPA-induced apoptosis. These cells
manifest an imbalance between proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic regulatory proteins, with overexpression of Bcl-2 and absence of Bax.19
In human melanoma cell lines, the HDAC inhibitors VPA and SAHA also induced a distinct modulation of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors that
is a possible mechanism of resistance. Two of 4 cell
lines that were tested were resistant to VPA and
showed an increased expression of the antiapoptotic
factor survivin. The same cells did not increase the
survivin level in response to SAHA but decreased

946

CANCER

the antiapoptotic factor BclXL. Both VPA and SAHA
decreased the level of survivin in VPA-sensitive
cells.20
Trus et al.21 investigated the effects of VPA 1 ATRA
in the AML cell line OCI/AML-2. VPA strongly affected gene expression, increasing the expression of
441 genes and decreasing the expression of 315
genes. Several of these genes were involved in cell
cycle regulation, interferon response, apoptosis, and
differentiation. Examples of decreased gene expression were cyclin A2 and MYC, whereas microtubuleassociated protein kinase, caspase 7, p21, p19 and
the cell surface markers CD9 and major histocompatablity complex Class II molecules were increased.
The addition of ATRA accentuated some responses
but affected a much smaller group of genes. VPA
also modulated p21 expression and the cell cycle in
clinical samples of non-M3 AML and increased apoptosis in 4 of 6 samples tested.
Induction of p21 expression by VPA has also
been demonstrated in t(15;17)-positive leukemic cells
independent of ATRA sensitivity22 and in MLL-related
leukemia, in which VPA also increased messenger
RNA transcripts of p27Kip1.23 In neuroblastoma cells,
VPA, tributyrin, and phenobarbital (PB) induced p21
expression, whereas only VPA induced a concomitant
increase in p27 expression.24
Thus, the induction of p21 expression appears to
be important for VPA-induced cell-cycle arrest and
differentiation, as also observed for other HDAC inhibitors. Mechanisms underlying apoptosis induction
are variable and include both the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways. A caspase-independent pathway
may be related to autophagic cell death, as demonstrated recently for SAHA and PB.25

Effects on normal and leukemic progenitor cells
Although VPA1ATRA induces apoptosis in many leukemia and solid tumor cell lines, it has opposite
effects in hematopoietic stem cells, in which it stimulates proliferation and self-renewal.26 It is noteworthy that this was associated with accelerated cell
cycle progression through the down-regulation of
p21. Another effect was activation of the Wnt-pathway and consecutive induction of homeobox B4
(HoxB4), a transcription factor involved in hematopoietic stem cell renewal. The effect on proliferation
and self-renewal, which was confirmed in leukemic
stem cells,27 could render quiescent leukemic stem
cells but also normal hematopoietic stem cells more
susceptible to cytotoxic drugs.
Similar effects were described in cultured human
CD34-positive cells.28 VPA preserved CD34 positivity,

enhanced ex vivo expansion under the influence of
cytokines, and increased the expression of genes
associated with an early hematopoietic stem cell
compartment (kinase insert domain protein receptor,
CD117, HOXB4). At specific regulatory sites on
HOXB4, histone H4 acetylation was increased.

Effects of VPA beyond the tumor cell
In addition to its effect on tumor cells, VPA also may
modulate immune responses and manipulate the
bone marrow microenvironment. Ichiyama et al.
reported that VPA inhibited the production of tumor
necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)
through the inhibition of nuclear factor jB (NF-jB)
activation in leukemia and glioma cell lines, suggesting that VPA may exhibit an immunosuppressive
effect.29 In the human myeloid leukemia cell lines
U937 and HEL, VPA had a different effect, increasing
gene expression of IL-18, a proinflammatory cytokine
that may be involved in antitumor immunity.30 Compared with sodium butyrate and TSA, VPA apparently
uses other mechanisms to activate IL-18 expression.
Moreover, VPA repressed the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth
factor in Caco-2 cells31 and inhibited proliferation,
migration, and tube formation in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells. Angiogenesis also was inhibited in a chicken chorioalantoic membrane assay
and in a Matrigel plug assay in mice. The effect on
angiogenesis was coupled with the drug’s capability
of inhibiting HDAC.6
Clinical Studies
When it was observed that VPA acted as an HDAC
inhibitor and induced the differentiation of malignant myeloid cells in vitro, we planned to investigate
its clinical activity in AML and MDS. In a pilot study,
we treated 23 patients with VPA either alone or in
combination with ATRA.32 The overall response rate
was 35%. There was a trend toward better responses
in the patients with low-risk MDS, although 3 of 9
patients who had elevated blasts showed a reduction
in blast count.
Therefore, we studied VPA further in 58 patients
with AML.33 The response rate was only 5% according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria
for AML, but it was 16% when IWG criteria for MDS
were used, which capture hematologic improvement. One patient who developed an early recurrence after intensive chemotherapy achieved a
complete response (CR) that lasted for 16 months.
In 2005, we reported follow-up data on 122
patients.34 Similar to our previous series, VPA was

administered to achieve serum concentrations
between 50 lg/mL and 100 lg/mL. ATRA was given
at a dose of 80 mg/m2 per day in 2 divided doses every second week. Twenty-two patients who were treated at a collaborating institution received ATRA at a
lower dose of 15 mg/m2 per day continuously, and
90 patients received VPA monotherapy with the addition of ATRA planned for nonresponders or patients
who developed recurrent disease. Thirty-two patients
received the combination from the start. Sixty-two
patients had AML, and 60 patients had different
types of MDS. The response rate according to IWG
criteria for MDS was 20%. This included 1 CR, 1 partial response (PR), and 22 patients who had hematologic improvement. The response rate was better
when patients received VPA monotherapy (22% vs
13%). There was no difference between the 2 ATRA
dosing regimens. Twenty-nine VPA nonresponders
received additional ATRA without improvement. It is
interesting to note that, of 11 patients who developed
a disease recurrence and, thus, received additional
ATRA, 4 patients had a second response that lasted
significantly longer than their first response (22
months vs 5 months; P 5 .012).
Side effects included a decrease in platelet count
in 29 patients, most likely attributable to disease progression in the majority of patients. In 5 patients, a
causal relation with VPA was suspected. Correspondingly, platelets recovered after dose reduction or
treatment interruption. Twelve patients experienced
central nervous system toxicity, which led to the discontinuation of VPA in 6 patients.
Response rates differed according to FrenchAmerican-British and World Health Organization

tory anemia (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts
(RARS), 36% and 39%, respectively, responded to VPA
treatment, whereas the response rate was much
lower in patients who had RA with excess blasts
(RAEB), RAEB in transformation, chronic monomyelocytic leukemia, and AML (5%, 11%, 0%, and 15%,
respectively). The difference between patients who
had MDS with a normal blast count and patients
who had MDS with an elevated blast count was
highly significant (P 5 .005).
The International Prognostic Scoring System
(IPSS) was a good predictor for response, with an
overall response rate of 50% for low-risk MDS, 22%
for intermediate-I MDS, 11% for intermediate-II
MDS, and only 8% for high-risk MDS (Table 2). There
also was a difference in response duration between
low-risk and high-risk patients that reached borderline significance (P 5 .05) (Fig. 1). Some patients
achieved long-lasting responses, up to 3 years. It is
interesting to note that 2 of those patients had previously responded to immunosuppressive treatment
with antithymocyte globulin.
The response rates also differed according to
karyotype, but the difference was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, CRs, PRs, and most of the
major responses occurred in the group with low-risk
karyotypes. We conclude that the best responders to
VPA treatment were those who had normal bone
marrow blast counts and low IPSS scores. According
to our results, patients should start with VPA monotherapy. In responders, ATRA can be added to extend
the duration of responses.
Other groups also investigated whether VPA is
active against myeloid malignancies. Bug et al. treated 26 patients with poor-risk AML using VPA
(starting dose, 5–10 mg/kg) plus ATRA (45 mg/m2)
continuously.35 In that study, only 19 patients completed at least 4 weeks of treatment, and 7 patients
had to be withdrawn from the study because of rapid

between low-risk and high-risk patients.

disease progression or toxicity. Additional cytoreductive treatment with low-dose cytarabine or hydroxyurea to control leukocytosis was required in 58%
of patients. No CR was observed, 1 patient showed
minor hematologic improvement, and 2 patients
with secondary AML arising from a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) achieved a PR with clearance of
peripheral blasts. It is noteworthy that both of those
patients developed profound granulocytosis concurrent with their reduction of blast cells, reminiscent of
the response to ATRA in promyelocytic leukemia.
Because both patients received additional cytotoxic
treatment, the authors concluded that VPA lacked
sufficient antiproliferative effect. VPA at a moderate
serum concentration of 58 mg/L decreased HDAC2
protein levels in a responding patient and in a nonresponder.
In contrast to Bug et al., we observed that VPA
achieved an antiproliferative effect in 50% of patients
who presented with an elevated white blood cell
(WBC) count. One of our patients with MDS/MPD
had an increase in WBC up to 56,000/lL during
treatment. At the same time, the patient’s blast count
decreased. Subsequently, the WBC count fell rapidly
to a nadir of 1300/lL without cytoreduction, and a
complete peripheral blast clearance was achieved
that lasted for 6 months.
Cimino et al.36 performed a pilot study with VPA
followed by ATRA in a sequential schedule in 8

patients who had refractory or high-risk AML. No
responses according to IWG criteria for AML were
observed, but hematologic improvement occurred
in 2 patients. Hyperleukocytosis developed in 3
patients, including the 2 responders. An increasing
WBC count was associated with diminishing immature cells. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization,
the authors were able to prove differentiation induction in the leukemic clone. HDAC activity was inhibited in blood mononuclear cells from all 7 patients
who achieved VPA serum levels >50 lg/mL. This
VPA effect was correlated with differentiation induction, as demonstrated by morphologic, cytochemical,
immunophenotypic, and gene expression analyses.
Another study also investigated VPA1ATRA in a
sequential schedule.37 VPA was administered to
achieve serum concentrations of 45 lg/mL to 100
lg/mL, and ATRA (45 mg/m2) was added when VPA
reached the targeted serum concentration. Twenty
older patients with AML or MDS were treated.
According to IWG criteria for MDS, 6 patients
demonstrated hematologic improvement, and the
majority of them achieved platelet transfusion independence. No decreased blast counts were observed.
Side effects included grade 3 neurotoxicity in 4
patients. In some patients, hematologic improvement
occurred before ATRA was started, and withdrawal of
ATRA in 2 responders did not spoil hematologic
improvement.
Raffoux et al.38 used VPA and ATRA to treat elderly patients with AML. They observed bone marrow responses in 3 of 11 patients, including 1 CR.
Two additional patients showed hematologic improvement according to MDS criteria. It is noteworthy that 4 of 5 responders in that study had a
normal karyotype. Similar to the other trials, VPA
was administered to reach serum levels recommended for the treatment of seizures. ATRA was
given on a continuous schedule (45 mg/m2 daily) in
combination with theophylline to increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate.
In a Phase I/II study of VPA1ATRA therapy in
patients with high-risk AML, 4 of 20 patients had a
hematologic response.39 One CR and 2 PRs were
achieved. Theophylline was added for patients who
had failed to respond after 28 days. Combined treatment resulted in increased levels of histone acetylation and methylation and induced expression of p15,
p16, and p21. Induction of TRAIL was documented
in 3 patients, 2 of whom showed a clinical response.
In line with a previous in vitro study, specific
changes in HDAC expression patterns were noted,
with the selective up-regulation of HDAC11 and, to a
lesser extent, HDAC9 and SIRT-4.15

Clinical trials with VPA in patients with AML and
MDS are summarized in Table 3. McMullin et al.40
described another option for using VPA. They
reported on a PML-RARa-positive patient with APL
who was unable to continue intensive treatment after
a single course of induction chemotherapy. Because
of seizures, treatment was initiated with VPA and the
patient remained in molecular disease remission for
2.5 years. There is no clear evidence that the prolonged remission was attributable to VPA. Nevertheless, it may be worthwhile to add VPA to current
maintenance regimens to improve the disappointing
results of maintenance treatment in patients with
AML.
When VPA was identified as an HDAC inhibitor,
it was unclear whether this effect could be harnessed
in vivo, considering its strong plasma protein-binding ability and significant toxicity at high doses.
However, all protocols that are presented herein,
employing VPA orally on a continuous schedule at
conventional dosages, demonstrated clinical activity.
Several observations suggest that the desired HDACinhibitory activity indeed was present at the dosages
employed.
First, investigators demonstrated histone acetylation36 as well as degradation of HDAC2.35 In a Phase
I study of patients with cervical carcinoma,41 posttreatment hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 in tumor
cells was observed in 9 and 7 out of 10 patients,
respectively, and tumor deacetylase activity de-

creased in 8 patients. There was a statistically significant difference between pretreatment and posttreatment HDAC activity.
Second, it is believed that the induction of fetal
hemoglobin (HbF) production by SCFAs is mediated
by HDAC inhibition. In 30 children who were treated
with VPA for epilepsy, HbF levels were increased significantly for at least 3 months compared with the
levels in untreated controls. The amount of HbF was
correlated with VPA serum levels.42
Third, at conventional doses, VPA has some
delayed effects, including teratogenicity8,43 and a
mood-stabilizing effect,1 which, in contrast to anticonvulsive activity, are believed to be caused by
HDAC inhibition. Finally, there may be a carcinogenic effect of the drug. Coyle et al. described 3 cases
of secondary leukemia in patients after long-term
treatment for seizures.44 Despite the evidence for
HDAC inhibitory activity of VPA at conventional
doses, the optimal treatment schedule still has to be
determined.
Diverse, structurally different HDAC inhibitors
have entered clinical trials. Preliminary data in AML
demonstrated diminishing blast counts in a subset of
patients but few responses according to conventional
AML response criteria. With phenylbutyrate, another
SCFA, 4 of 16 patients with AML and MDS achieved
hematologic improvement. Other patients developed
transient increases in neutrophils or platelets and
decrements in circulating blasts.45 Gozzini et al.

reported in vitro selectivity of butyrate for blasts
from core binding factor-AML.46 Although VPA was
capable in vitro of inducing differentiation of AML
blasts with various underlying genetic alterations,7
the best responses may be expected in patients with
core binding factor-leukemia.
This view was supported by a study with depsipeptide47 in which responses occurred preferentially
in patients who had translocations known to recruit
histone deacetylases. In a Phase I study of depsipeptide, constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and
nausea prevented repeated dosing. Although some
patients experienced transient declines in blood and
bone marrow blast counts, and 1 patient developed
tumor lysis syndrome, no CR or PR was observed.48
In another Phase I study, the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 achieved no responses in 38 patients
with advanced acute leukemias but induced
increased protein and histone H3/H4 acetylation,
p21 expression, and caspase-3 activation.49
SAHA (Vorinostat) was investigated in a Phase I
trial of 2 oral dose schedules: either 2 times or 3
times daily 314 days every 21 days. The study
included patients with acute or chronic leukemias
and MDS. Forty-one patients were registered: Thirtyone patients had AML, 4 patients had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 3 patients had MDS, 2
patients had ALL, and 1 patient had CML. Side
effects included nausea, vomiting, typhlitis, fatigue,
and diarrhea. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
oral vorinostat was 200 mg either 2 times or 3 times
daily. Overall, 9 patients (21%) had objective evidence of response, including 1 CR, 2 pathologic CRs
(CRp), 1 PR, and 5 complete bone marrow responses.
All responses were observed in patients with AML.50
When we began to investigate the clinical activity
of VPA, we decided to study MDS in addition to
AML, speculating that we may be able to achieve
higher response rates in ‘‘preleukemia’’ compared
with full-blown AML. In fact, we observed the best
responses in patients who had low-risk MDS. Surprisingly, a drug that is supposed to induce apoptosis
succeeded in a clonal bone marrow disorder characterized by increased apoptosis.51 There are several
possible explanations.
1) It is known that VPA exerts different effects in
different cell types. For example, it induces proliferation in early stem cells.26–28 In the trial by Cimino
et al., in vivo maturation of AML blasts induced by
VPA1ATRA was associated with recruitment of cells
from resting G0 and G1 phases into cycling S and
G2-M phases. Moreover, the frequency of apoptotic
cells in the bone marrow of 1 of the responding
patients was reduced greatly after 7 days of treat-

ment.36 2) VPA inhibits angiogenesis,31 which plays a
role in MDS pathogenesis. 3) VPA inhibits the production of TNF-a and IL-6 and the activation of
NF-jB.29 This is relevant, because immunosuppression can be beneficial in patients who have low-risk
MDS.52

Combination Regimens
Because VPA is well tolerated, it appears to be suitable for combination therapy. Based on in vitro synergism with ATRA,7 investigators initiated clinical trials
with VPA1ATRA. The idea is that HDAC inhibition
by VPA is useful first to relieve transcriptional repression of key pathways of myeloid differentiation in
AML blasts. The clinical benefit of adding ATRA
remains to be established. Another differentiationinducing agent is interferon-a, which demonstrated
synergism with VPA in vitro against neuroblastoma
cell lines.53
An attractive combination that currently is being
investigated by several groups is directed toward
reversing the combined epigenetic silencing that
occurs through histone deacetylation and DNA
methylation. Cooperating activity of demethylating
agents and HDAC inhibitors has been demonstrated
in vitro by several investigators.10,54 With regard to
VPA, Yang et al.55 corroborated this approach by
demonstrating a synergistic effect with decitabine in
terms of growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis,
and reactivation of p57KIP2 and p21CIP1.
In a recent Phase I/II trial of this combination
regimen, 54 patients received decitabine (15 mg/m2
per day intravenously) and VPA (escalating doses of
20 mg/kg per day, 35 mg/kg per day, and 50 mg/kg
per day) concomitantly for 10 days every 28 days.56
Neurologic toxicity was common, but toxicities
grade >2 developed only in a few patients who
were treated at the higher dose levels. A dose of 50
mg/kg was identified as safe and was chosen for
Phase II of the trial. Twelve of 54 patients (22%)
and 5 of 10 elderly, previously untreated patients
(50%) achieved a CR or CRp. Remission duration
was 7.2 months, and the median time to response
was 60 days. Although an association between
higher VPA dose levels and response was not
observed in the group as a whole, it could be
demonstrated in the more homogeneous subgroup
of previously untreated patients. This is in keeping
with in vitro data showing that higher concentrations of VPA were superior with regard to synergism, cytotoxicity, and histone acetylation.55
The combination of VPA and demethylating
agents can be augmented by ATRA. The combined
3 drugs can overcome epigenetic barriers to

transcription of a prototypically silenced tumor
suppressor gene, RARb2, in breast cancer cells.57
Preliminary results from a Phase I/II study of the
combination of 5-azacytidine, VPA, and ATRA in
patients with high-risk MDS, patients with recurrent/refractory disease, and patients aged >60 years
with untreated AML recently were presented. Subcutaneous 5-azacytidine was used at a dose of 75
mg/m2 daily 37; oral ATRA was used at a dose of
45 mg/m2 daily 35 starting on Day 3; and oral VPA
doses were 50 mg/kg, 62.5 mg/kg, and 75 mg/kg
daily 37 concomitant with 5-azacytidine. Thirtyone patients were evaluable. Dose-limiting toxicities were neurotoxicity, confusion, and somnolence.
The MTD of VPA was 50 mg/kg. Twelve patients
were enrolled in the Phase II trial. Of the 31 evaluable patients, 9 patients achieved a CR, and 3
patients achieved a CRp, resulting in an overall
response rate of 39%. The response rate in
untreated patients was 56%, and it was 50% for all
patients who were treated at the MTD. The median
number of courses to response was 1 course (range,
1–3 courses). VPA bound levels on Day 2 were significantly higher in responders (P < .005).58
Strictly speaking, the benefit of adding VPA to
demethylating agents can be determined only within
a randomized trial. Nevertheless, the CR rates of the
above-mentioned studies compare advantageously
with trials of decitabine and 5-azacytidine as single
agents. Furthermore, higher VPA doses and serum
levels were associated with higher response rates and
earlier responses. Finally, compared to single-agent
decitabine/5-azacytidine, combination therapy with
VPA diminished the median number of treatment
courses needed to achieve a response.
Other agents that have been tested in vitro in
combination with HDAC inhibitors are APO2L/
Trail59; the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol60 and geldanamycin, a heat-shock protein 90
antagonist, in leukemia cells61; the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, imatinib, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352 in bcr-abl-positive leukemias62–64; and
the mTor inhibitor rapamycin in FLT3-ITD cells.18
HDAC inhibitors modulate cell cycle regulatory proteins. Therefore, combination with cell cycle-specific
cytotoxic drugs may achieve increased cytotoxicity.
In this regard, synergism was observed when HDAC
inhibitors were combined with docetaxel, epothilone
B, and gemcitabine in breast cancer65; combined
with 5-fluorouracil in colon cancer66; combined with
etoposide, camptothecin, doxorubicin, and cisplatinum in glioblastoma67; combined with topoisomerase II inhibitors, cytarabine, and fludarabine in
leukemia14,27,68; and combined with cytarabine,

951

etoposide, and topotecan in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL, and multiple myeloma cells.69,70
Several studies have demonstrated that VPA
synergizes with cytarabine.19,71 The combination
caused G1 arrest and up-regulation of cyclin-D1
expression. VPA also blocked cytarabine-induced
p27-Kip1 down-regulation. The German Leukemia
Study Group I currently compares standard chemotherapy with the same regimen complemented by
VPA and/or ATRA.72

Future Directions
Defining the optimal dosing of VPA will be an important task for future investigations. All studies with
VPA alone or in combination with ATRA employed
conventional-dose VPA on a continuous schedule.
Much higher doses were used in the trials that combined VPA with demethylating agents. Toxicity was
acceptable if VPA was administered on a short-term
basis using an intermittent schedule.56,58 In those
studies, VPA levels were higher in responders, but a
dose dependency of the antileukemic effect is hard
to ascertain when VPA is not administered as a single
agent. In contrast to continual dosing, an intermittent schedule is expected to require higher daily
doses of VPA, because it takes several days to build
up sufficient plasma levels during every new course.
It remains to be determined whether high VPA peak
levels are more important than sufficient steady-state
levels to achieve maximum antileukemic activity.
Even higher VPA doses than those used in combination with demethylating agents appear to be tolerable on a short-term basis. In a Phase I trial that
investigated a combination regimen with epirubicin
in solid tumors, a VPA dosage of 160 mg/kg per day
for 3 days was identified as the MTD.73 For combining VPA with demethylating agents, some investigators propose a maximal effect on gene reactivation
when the demethylating agent is administered first,
followed by the HDAC inhibitor. Other investigators
were unable to confirm that this sequence is important with regard to cell kill.55
In vitro data support the use of VPA in several
types of cancer. In addition to AML and MDS, other
myeloid malignancies such as myeloproliferative syndromes are of special interest. This idea is supported
by in vitro data in CML62 as well as favorable clinical
responses in patients with MDS/MPS32 and secondary AML that developed from MPD.35 Hematologic
improvement also was reported in a patient with
myelofibrosis.74
The discovery of VPA as an anticonvulsive agent
was a milestone in the history of antiepileptic treatment,

952

but newer drugs often are preferred today. Likewise,
in hematologic oncology, VPA should be regarded as
a first-generation HDAC inhibitor. Novel VPA derivatives with more potent antitumor activity as well as
structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors already are
under investigation.75 Nevertheless, VPA remains
attractive for further investigation because of its
well-known pharmacologic and toxicity profile and
because it is a specific inhibitor of Class I HDACs.
Working on optimal treatment schedules, extending
clinical trials to other hematologic malignancies, and
testing the most promising combination regimens
are worthwhile projects for the future.
