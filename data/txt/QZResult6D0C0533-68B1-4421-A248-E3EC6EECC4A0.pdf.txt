Correction: Hydrogen Peroxide-Mediated
Cytosolic Acidiﬁcation Is a Signal for
Mitochondrial Translocation of Bax during
Drug-Induced Apoptosis of Tumor Cells
In this article (Cancer Res 2004;64:7867–78), which was published in the November
1, 2004 issue of Cancer Research (1), errors were identiﬁed in a number of ﬁgures.
In Fig. 2B, the last two lanes (5 and 6) were mistakenly the same as the control lanes
(1 and 2). The correct blot for the data (CatþH2O2) is now shown in the panel. A
similar error occurred in Fig. 2C where zVAD-fmk control (top blot) was mixed up
with the control lanes (medium) from Fig. 2C. The correct blot for zVAD-fmk control
has now been included. The correct control for mitochondrial purity (AIF) is also
included to replace Mn SOD blot.
In Fig. 5E, the cleavage of nuclear PARP is shown. The full-length PARP serves as an
internal control for assessing caspase-3–mediated cleavage. An incorrect b-actin blot
was included, which was not indicated in this panel. This has been deleted in the
corrected panel.
In Fig. 6B, the loading control from Fig. 1G was inadvertently included. This has been
replaced with the correct loading control for the experiment. In Fig. 6D panel, there
was duplication of two pairs of blots: the medium and catalase controls and C1 and
ZVADþC1–treated cells. These mistakes have been corrected with the original
respective blots from the same experiment. The correct mitochondrial purity blot
for Mn SOD for C1-treated fractions is also included.

H2O2 triggers mitochondrial translocation of Bax. A, lysates of HCT116Baxþ/ cells (5  10 ) following exposure to H2O2 for 0–24 hours were subjected to

Western blot analysis using anti-Bax or anti-Bcl-2 antibodies as described in Materials and Methods. B and C, HCT116Baxþ/ cells (1  10 ) were treated with
H2O2 for 12 hours in the presence or absence of either 1,000 U/mL of catalase (B) or 100 mM ZVAD-fmk and cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions
were subjected to Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-Bax (C). Mitochondrial purity was veriﬁed by blotting with a monoclonal antibody against the
mitochondrial protein AIF.

In Fig. 10A (top right panel), the histogram from Bax/ cells was erroneously

The authors greatly regret the errors; however, they have provided all the original data
supporting the validity of the results and the scientiﬁc message. The corrected ﬁgures
appear below.
