Abstract
5-azacytidine (5-aza) is a hypomethylating agent approved for the treatment of
high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It is assumed to act by demethylating
tumor suppressor genes and via direct cytotoxic effects on malignant cells. In vitro
treatment with hypomethylating agents has profound effects on the expression of
killer-cell immunoglobulin-like (KIR) receptors on natural killer (NK) cells, as these
receptors are epigenetically regulated via methylation of the promoters. Here we
investigated the influence of 5-aza on the NK-cell repertoire during cytokine-induced
proliferation in vitro and homeostatic proliferation in vivo in patients with high-risk
MDS. In vitro treatment of NK cells from both healthy donors and MDS patients with
low doses of 5-aza led to a significant increase in expression of multiple KIRs, but
only in cells that had undergone several rounds of cell division. Proliferating 5-aza
exposed NK cells exhibited increased IFN-γ production and degranulation towards
tumor target cells. MDS patients had lower proportions of educated KIR-expressing
NK cells than healthy controls but after systemic treatment with 5-aza, an increased
proportion of Ki-67+ NK cells expressed multiple KIRs suggesting uptake of 5-aza
in cycling cells in vivo. Hence, these results suggest that systemic treatment with
5-aza may shape the NK cell repertoire, in particular during homeostatic proliferation,
thereby boosting NK cell-mediated recognition of malignant cells.

Introduction

(MDS) is a group of clonal stem cell disorders
characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, a potential
for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
which is connected to deregulation of innate immune
and inflammatory signaling [3]. Abnormal cellular
differentiation in MDS can frequently be linked to aberrant
genome-wide and loci-specific DNA hypermethylation
as well as mutations in genes that regulate epigenetic
programs [4].

Epigenetic modifications are a common hallmark
of all human cancers [1] and can include alterations in
methylation patterns where methyl groups are added
or removed from CpG sites in DNA. In hematopoietic
malignancies, the promoter CpG islands of tumorsuppressor genes are often hypermethylated and thus
epigenetically silenced [2]. Myelodysplastic syndrome

Several epigenetic drugs have been developed
for cancer treatment, including the cytosine analogs
5-azacytidine (5-aza) and 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine
(decitabine). 5-aza has been shown to induce a clinical
response in around 50% of patients with MDS and
treatment is associated with prolonged survival [5]. For
the last 10 years, 5-aza has been the first-line treatment
for patients with high-risk MDS and acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) with dysplastic features and 20-29%
marrow blasts [6]. 5-aza and decitabine lack methylation
sites thus effectively acting as DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors (DNMTs). 5-aza particularly inhibits DNMT1,
which is completely depleted after 5-aza exposure due to
the formation of an irreversible covalent bond, leading
to loss of DNA methylation marks [7, 8]. In this way,
methylation-dependent silencing in cancer cell lines is
reversed in a dose-dependent manner, where only low
doses that do not disturb replication show hypomethylating
effects [9].
Besides demethylation, administration of 5-aza
may also delay the progression of MDS by influencing
the immunological control of the malignant clone
[10]. Natural killer (NK) cells express a vast array of
activating receptors that sense cellular stress, including
NKG2D, DNAM-1 and natural cytotoxicity receptors
(NCRs) [11]. Stressed and transformed cells upregulate
MHC class I chain related proteins A and B (MICA/B)
and UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs) (NKG2DL)
that interact with NKG2D, one of the major NK-cell
activating receptors involved in tumor cell recognition
[12]. Absence of transcription of NKG2DL, due to high
levels of DNA methylation, can be detected in tumor cell
lines but expression can be restored by treatment with
demethylating agents [13, 14].
In addition to synergistic signaling through
activating receptors, NK cell cytotoxicity is tightly
controlled by the expression of MHC class I binding
receptors including CD94/NKG2A and killer cell
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). Variegated
expression of these receptors in the NK cell repertoire
confers tolerance to normal cells but also contributes
to determine the functional potential of the cells in a
process termed education [15, 16]. Interactions between
inhibitory KIRs and/or CD94/NKG2A and their cognate
HLA class I ligands at steady state influence the ability of
the cell to respond to environmental changes, including
the recognition of cells with low expression of HLA
class I [17, 18]. KIRs are acquired late during NK cell
differentiation and are also commonly expressed on
terminally differentiated CD56+ T cells [19]. In both
T and NK cells, KIR expression is regulated at the
transcriptional level by epigenetic changes in a complex
and synchronized fashion determined by the activities
from multiple promoters [20]. KIR genes are consistently
demethylated in cells expressing KIRs and methylated in
cells without KIR expression [21, 22]. The transcriptional
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulation of KIR genes leads to a stochastic expression
of KIR proteins at the cell surface, where some NK
cells do not express a single KIR while others express
combinations of multiple KIRs [23, 24]. In vitro, NK cell
lines and primary ex vivo expanded NK cells upregulate
KIRs on their cell surface during decitabine [21, 22] and
5-aza stimulation [25].
In spite of existing in vitro data on the effects of
hypomethylating agents on the NK cell compartment,
little is known regarding the possible effects of 5-aza on
NK cells in vivo. Given the high turn-over of NK cells in
peripheral blood [26] we hypothesized that incorporation
of 5-aza during NK cell homeostasis might lead to altered
expression of KIR, thereby affecting their functionality
through education and possibly impact their ability to
mediate anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, we reasoned that
changes in KIR expression might serve as a sensitive tool
to monitor uptake of 5-aza into circulating cells in vivo,
the evidence for which is sparse [27]. Our data show that
expression of multiple KIRs was rapidly induced on NK
cells during in vitro culture with physiologically relevant
low doses of 5-aza. This effect was tightly linked to IL-2
driven cellular proliferation and therefore most prominent
in less differentiated cells with high proliferative
capacity. Longitudinal assessment of NK cells in MDS
patients undergoing systemic 5-aza treatment revealed
increased frequencies of KIR expression in Ki-67+ NK
cells, indicative of 5-aza uptake during cell division in
vivo. Interestingly, cycling NK cells exposed to 5-aza
in vitro had higher degranulation and IFN-γ production
in response to K562 target cells suggesting enhanced
function post-5-aza exposure. Our data reveal an imprint
of 5-aza on NK cells in vivo and support the notion that the
therapeutic effects of 5-aza may be partially mediated via
epigenetic remodeling of the immune system.

Results
5-aza increases KIR expression on proliferating
NK cells in vitro
To assess the effect of the hypomethylating
drug 5-aza on the NK cell KIR repertoire of healthy
individuals, NK cells were isolated from PBMC and
cultured in vitro with IL-2 in the presence or absence of
5-aza. 5-aza was added consecutively to the culture at
dose-levels in the range of those observed in plasma of
patients receiving systemic treatment [28]. After six days
the frequency of cells expressing KIRs was analyzed
using a flow-cytometry panel that enabled identification
of cells expressing single KIRs or combination thereof
(Figure 1A). Addition of 5-aza significantly increased the
frequency of total KIR-expressing NK cells, of NK cells
co-expressing 2, 3 or 4 KIRs and of each of the analyzed

inhibitory KIRs (Figure 1B-1D). In the three donors
with group B KIR haplotype, a similar increase in the
expression of KIR2DS1 was noted (as illustrated by one
donor in Figure 1A).
As the hypomethylating effects of 5-aza require
incorporation into DNA during cell division [29], we
stratified the analysis based on the number of cell divisions
(Figure 2A) induced by IL-2. The effect of 5-aza on KIR
expression was most evident in cycling cells, where nearly
100% of the cells expressed at least one KIR following
three or more cell divisions (Figure 2B). This was in sharp
contrast to cultures without 5-aza where we observed a
gradual decline in KIR expression, presumingly due to
the preferential proliferation of less differentiated KIRNK cells [30]. Notably, late generation NK cells also
co-expressed multiple KIRs, which was rarely seen in
non-dividing cells (Figure 2C-2E). To assess if 5-aza

preferentially induced specific combinations of KIRs,
we resolved the KIR repertoire of NK cells in generation
3+. Again, the frequency of NK cells expressing three or
more KIRs was higher with addition of 5-aza, although no
specific pattern in the KIR repertoire was noticed (Figure
2F).

5-aza-induced KIR expression is most evident in
NKG2A+CD57- NK cells
To further explore the effect of 5-aza on NK cells,
we stratified the analysis based on the stage of NK cell
differentiation as determined by the expression of NKG2A
and CD57. In agreement with previous results [30] less
differentiated NKG2A+CD57- NK cells proliferated the
most in response to IL-2 (Figure 3A). Although 5-aza

a cohort of high-risk MDS patients. To this end we first
compared the baseline frequencies of NK cell subsets
in healthy donors and patients. The overall frequency of
NK cells and CD56bright NK cells were similar in healthy
controls and patients pre-treatment (Supplementary
Figure 1A-1B). The distribution of NKG2A+CD57- and
NKG2A-CD57+ subsets varied greatly among patients
with a tendency for higher frequencies of more immature
subsets (Supplementary Figure 1C-1D) in line with
previous findings [31]. Notably, however, the frequency of
KIR2DL3+ and KIR3DL1+ NK cells, as well as NK cells
expressing multiple KIRs, was significantly lower in MDS

patients than in healthy donors (Figure 4A-4B). To follow
dynamic changes during therapy, patients were samples
at day one and day five in standard treatment regimes. On
bulk NK cells the KIR repertoire was similar regardless
of 5-aza, even when patients had undergone a total of 4
cycles of treatment (data not shown). However, as the in
vitro data clearly showed that cell division was needed for
5-aza-induced KIR expression, we focused our analysis
on the pool of cells expressing Ki-67, a surrogate marker
for cells having undergone recent in vivo activation/
proliferation [32]. Before treatment, patients displayed
increased levels of Ki-67+ NK cells that returned to
baseline on day five post-treatment (Figure 4C). In line
with the in vitro proliferation data, more Ki-67+ cells
were found within the less differentiated NKG2A+CD57NK cell subset than in the terminally differentiated
NKG2A-CD57+ NK cell in healthy donors as well as
patients (Supplementary Figure 1E). Notably, there was
an increased frequency of Ki-67+ NK cells expressing
KIR2DL3 after five days of 5-aza administration (Figure
4D). Furthermore, the frequency of cells expressing
multiple KIRs was also increased (Figure 4E). When the
Ki-67+ NK cells were stratified into NKG2A+CD57- and
NKG2A-CD57+ subsets, the effect of 5-aza was greater in
the NKG2A+CD57- subset (Figure 4F) concurrent with the
in vitro data (Figure 3B). Thus, these data demonstrate that
5-aza treatment increases the total pool of KIR expressing

NK cells, thereby partly restoring a mature NK repertoire
in MDS patients.

5-aza does not accumulate in NK cells to give KIR
expression upon induced proliferation
As 5-aza has a short half-life in vivo [28], cellular
uptake and storage could play an important role in its
mechanism of action. To address whether NK cells had
been loaded with 5-aza in vivo but not yet undergone
cell division and demethylation of KIR promoters, we
monitored KIR repertoires in pre- and post 5-aza treatment
patient samples after IL-2-induced proliferation in vitro.
Proliferation rates of NK cells in patients were comparable
to healthy donors and in most donors; systemic treatment
with 5-aza lowered the ability of NK cells to proliferate in
response to IL-2 (Supplementary Figure 2A). There was no
effect on KIR expression regardless of the number of cell
divisions during in vitro culture (Supplementary Figure
2B-2E), suggesting that NK cells had not accumulated
intracellular stores of 5-aza.
Moreover, in vitro 5-aza addition to NK cells
from MDS patients sampled pre-treatment induced KIR
expression, although not to the extent observed in NK
cells of healthy donors. In MDS patient samples, around
20% of NK cells that had divided three or more times in

proliferation with or without 5-aza, we removed IL-2
for two days before subjecting the NK cells to a K562
tumor target cell assay. This rest period allowed for the
induced effects of 5-aza to act independently of IL-2
induced hyper-responsiveness. As expected, KIR+ NK
cells were more frequently CD107a+ and produced IFN-γ
as compared to KIR- cells following K562 stimulation
(data not shown). 5-aza-treatment of NK cells led to
significantly higher IFN-γ responses (Figure 5A and 5C),
which was linked to proliferation (Figure 5D). Generation
3+ NK cells also had higher fractions of CD107a+ cells as
compared to the same generation from untreated cultures
(Figure 5E). Because of the variable frequencies of NK

cells reaching generation 3, increased degranulation
after 5-aza treatment was only visible at the bulk level
in some donors (Figure 5B), correlating with killing of
target cells as measured in a FACS-based killing assay
(Supplementary Figure 4A-4B). Both KIR- and KIR+
NK cells displayed enhanced responses to target cell
stimulation following 5-aza treatment, although the KIR+
subset showed the largest increase in IFN-γ production
(Figure 5F-5G). These results revealed that 5-aza had
profound and replication-dependent effects on NK cell
functionality, which were only partly linked to acquisition
of inhibitory KIRs.

MDS patients present with disturbed hematopoiesis
in the myeloid lineage and defects in the number and
subtypes of peripheral cells of multiple lymphoid
lineages [31, 34-36]. MDS NK cells have impaired
responses against tumor targets and immature subsets
are overrepresented [31, 34, 36]. Here we show that
5-aza treatment increases expression of multiple KIRs in
proliferating NK cells both in vitro and in MDS patients
undergoing 5-aza treatment, and that 5-aza exposed
proliferating NK cells display a higher functionality and

may thus contribute to a beneficial anti-leukemic effect in
5-aza treated patients.
Previous reports demonstrated a profound effect
on KIR expression in NK cells in vitro by the 5-aza
related drug decitabine [21, 22]. However, decitabine
has a largely different mode of action compared to 5-aza,
involving incorporation only into DNA in contrast to
the dual integration into both RNA and DNA of 5-aza
[37]. Extending the results of Gao et al. [25] our highresolution analysis of the NK cell KIR repertoire showed
that low-dose 5-aza treatment of NK cells induced a
significant expression of multiple inhibitory KIRs but only
in proliferating cells. Thus, 5-aza was able to affect KIR
promoter methylation despite the relatively lower degree
of incorporation into DNA compared to decitabine. This
is consistent with the need for only minor substitution of
5-aza for cytosine in DNA to inactivate more than 95%
of DNMT1 [38]. We observed no preferential induction
of specific KIRs or combinations of KIRs, suggesting
a non-discriminate demethylation of the CpG islands
adjacent to the KIR gene promotors, in line with the global
demethylation by 5-aza observed in primary MDS CD34+
bone marrow cells [39].
Despite detailed knowledge on the effect of 5-aza on
various immune cell subsets and cancer cell lines in vitro,
little is known regarding 5-aza effects on the immune cell
compartment in vivo. MDS patients had lower fractions of
KIR-expressing NK cells pre-treatment and also tended
to have lower frequencies of the most mature NKG2ACD57+ NK cell subset. These data are consistent with
those previously reported by Hejazi et al. [31], albeit
they noted higher levels of KIR2DL3 in MDS patients.
Interestingly, although we observed lower levels of all
KIRs before therapy, the proliferating Ki-67+ fraction of
NK cells displayed a selective increase in KIR2DL3, also
manifested as higher frequencies of NK cells expressing
multiple inhibitory KIRs. It was previously shown that
the haplotype C1-specific KIR2DL2/3 is acquired earlier
and with higher frequency than the C2-specific KIR2DL1
during NK cell differentiation [40-42] potentially
explaining why the effect was most pronounced in this
NK cell subset. Together these data indicate uptake
of the drug into circulating cells and a demethylating
effect of the drug in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo when
proliferating NK cells were stratified into subsets based
on NKG2A and CD57 expression the effect of 5-aza
was greater in the NKG2A+CD57- subset, suggesting
an overall skewing of the NK cell pool towards a more
mature profile [30] under 5-aza influence. Notably, the
in vivo effect of 5-aza was noted in the absence of IL-2
under steady-state. It is possible that the induction of KIR
will be more pronounced if 5-aza is administrated together
with immunomodulatory therapies or during the early
reconstitution following stem cell transplantation.
When a standard dose of 5-aza is administered
subcutaneously to patients, the highest levels measurable
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in plasma are similar, or slightly higher, to those that can
induce demethylation in vitro [28, 43]. However, 5-aza
is rapidly cleared from circulation with a half time in
plasma of less than one hour [28] partly due to the action
of the enzyme cytidine deaminase, which catalyzes the
deamination of 5-aza, thereby destabilizing the drug
and reducing the in vivo half-life [44]. Administration of
5-aza to MDS patients decreases the number of highly
methylated loci but, surprisingly, the maximal effects
on methylation levels appear one week after the end of
drug administration [45] indicating that shifts in the NK
cell KIR repertoire may be more noticeable at later timepoints.
NK cells can contribute to the killing of MDS
blast cells and disease progression may be associated
with evasion of NK-cell mediated immune surveillance
[46, 47]. Previous studies have demonstrated a strong
association between reduced numbers and function of both
peripheral and bone-marrow NK cells in MDS patients
and disease severity [31, 34, 36, 47]. Here proliferating
NK cells exposed to 5-aza in vitro exhibited considerably
higher responses against K562 cells, suggesting that NK
cells with an active uptake of 5-aza might mount improved
responses against tumor targets. It is important to point out
that this beneficial effect of 5-aza on NK cell cytotoxicity
may only be relevant in conditions of intensified
proliferation since resting NK cells are negatively affected
even at low doses of 5-aza.
NK-cell education regulates cytotoxic responses
against cellular targets and determines the functional
potential of NK cells [15, 16, 30]. Surprisingly, the
potentiating effect of 5-aza was evident in all cycling
NK cells, irrespective of KIR status. This could possibly
be a result of epigenetic remodeling of e.g. the IFN-γ
locus, in similarity to what is observed during NK cell
differentiation [48]. However, we observed no effect
of 5-aza on the expression of granulysin, perforin or
granzyme B or the activating receptors NKG2D or
DNAM-1 (data not shown), indicating a lack of general
upregulation of markers involved in NK cell activation/
effector pathways. It is also possible that NK cells that
had acquired KIR expression during cytokine-induced
proliferation lost expression during the two days of IL-2
‘rest’ and thus contributed to the response of the KIRpopulation. Indeed we noticed a drop in KIR expressing
cells between day 6 and 8 in generation 3+ NK cells.
Other studies have shown that short-term treatment
of resting NK cells with high doses of 5-aza lowers NK
cell reactivity [25, 33]. Such replication-independent
negative influence of 5-aza on NK cells that had not
undergone cell division was also noted in our study
despite the lower doses of 5-aza used. However,
Schmiedel found that although initially impaired, IFN-γ
production was recovered and even increased as compared
to controls when NK cells were treated for 4 days with
5-aza under IL-2 stimulation [33] thereby supporting our

results that proliferating cells with active incorporation
of 5-aza acquire a heightened functionality. A recent
study also demonstrated that decitabine treatment can
depolarize Th2 cells to effectively secrete IFN-γ, signal
via T-bet, and achieve demethylation of critical Th1
specific promoters [49]. The net effect of 5-aza on NK
cell anti-tumor responses was recently investigated in
B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCPALL) bearing humanized mice. It was shown that 5-aza
treatment reduced the tumor burden, which was attributed
to improved NK cell functionality rather than direct effects
of the drug on the tumor [50].
The prospect of engraftment of autologous or
allogeneic NK cells for the treatment of hematopoietic
malignancies has been highlighted in recent years [51].
The effects of 5-aza on the NK cell population may
provide an avenue of experimental modification of KIR
expression in this context. By selecting NK cells from
donors with a given KIR genotype, and culturing these in
the presence of 5-aza, it may be possible to increase KIR
expression and thereby obtain cultures with high density
of cells with enhanced function. Although 5-aza appears to
induce expression of all KIRs, co-culture in the presence
or absence of specific ligands may allow skewing of the
KIR repertoires towards desired specificities [52]. Such
efforts will require careful titration of the 5-aza doses,
since the drug affects proliferative responses even at
lower concentrations. 5-aza modulation of NK cells to
yield specific subsets has been suggested for therapeutic
applications for placental disorders associated with altered
NK cell biology [53] and for pre-treatment of patients
suffering from ALL [50].
In conclusion, these findings suggest that 5-aza
remodeling of components of the immune system may
act in concert with demethylating/cytotoxic effects on the
malignant clones in MDS patients and warrants further
investigations in NK cells of patients undergoing 5-aza
treatment.

days followed by three weeks of rest. Blood samples were
collected at day one (pre-treatment) and day five (posttreatment) of cycle one, and in some cases of cycle four.
Healthy adult donor buffy coats were obtained from the
blood bank at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge,
Sweden. The frequencies of KIR A and B haplotypes were
similar in healthy donors and patients (data not shown)
as estimated based on expression patterns obtained
with a 16-color KIR phenotyping panel, which resolves
KIR2DL1, KIR2DS1, KIR2DL2/S2 expression [54, 55].
No KIR genotyping was performed.

Cell processing
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
healthy controls and patients were isolated by density
gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Hypaque; GE Healthcare)
and NK cell phenotyping was performed directly ex vivo
without culturing. The remaining PBMC were rested
o.n. in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated human AB+ serum and 2 mM
L-glutamine), followed by next-day negative isolation
of NK cells (magnetic-activated cell sorting; Miltenyi
Biotech). Isolated NK cells were labeled with 0.5 µM
CellTrace Violet (Life Technologies), re-suspended
in culture medium supplemented with 500 U/ml IL-2
(Peprotech) at a concentration of 1.5x106 cells/ml and
cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 for six days. For in vitro
5-aza stimulation of healthy donor cultures or MDS patient
samples, NK cells were treated with 1µM 5-azacytidine
(Sigma) for the first 4 consecutive days of the culture.
K562 cells were culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% FBS and 5 mM L-glutamine at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Materials and Methods
Patients and healthy controls
The study was approved by the regional ethics
committee [Stockholm, Sweden, approval number
2006/229-31/3] and was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients (n=11) were recruited
from the Hematology unit at the Karolinska University
Hospital in Huddinge, Sweden. All patients gave their
informed consent. Median age of the cohort was 74 years
(range 45-83 years). According to the dosing schedule of
the Nordic MDS guidelines, patients were administered
100 mg/m2 of 5-azacytidine (5-aza) subcutaneously in
cycles consisting of one dose of 5-aza for five consecutive

nm laser, a 633-nm laser, a 405-nm laser, and a 562-nm
laser. Acquired data were analyzed in FlowJo software
(TreeStar, USA). Gating was performed on live CD19CD3-CD56+ single cells within the lymphocyte gate or on
CD56- K562 cells within a larger forward and side scatter
gate for killing assays.

This work was supported by grants from the
Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Children’s Cancer
Society, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Karolinska
Institutet, Oslo University Hospital, the Norwegian
Research Council, the KG Jebsen Foundation, the SouthEastern Norway Regional Health Authority and the
Norwegian Cancer Foundation. The authors declare no

Functional assays
NK cell function was evaluated after the sixday IL-2-driven proliferation -/+ in vitro 5-aza (as
described above) followed by a period of rest (48 h) in
IL-2-free culture medium. NK cells were then mixed
at a 1:1 ratio with K562 target cells and incubated in a
V-bottom 96-well plate for 4 h at 37C and 5% CO2. For
measurements of NK cell degranulation and intracellular
cytokine production, Monensin (Golgi Stop, 1:1500,
BD Biosciences), Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug, 1:1000, BD
Biosciences) and anti-CD107a PE were added at the
start of the 4 h co-incubation. At harvest, the cells were
surface stained, followed by fixation and permeabilization
(Fix/Perm kit, eBioscience) and subsequent intracellular
staining for IFN-γ. For FACS-based evaluation of NK cellmediated target cell killing, FITC conjugated caspase-3
substrate (FITC-VAD-FMK)(C3) was added at the start
of the 4 h co-incubation. At harvest, cells were stained
with LIVE/DEAD® Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (DCM)
and CD56 BV421. The percentage of lysed target cells
was determined as CD56-DCM+C3+ K562 cells. For all
functional assays, values from unstimulated cultures
were subtracted from stimulated cultures and subsequent
statistical analysis was performed.
