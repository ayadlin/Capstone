Abstract
Prostate cancer is thought to be driven by oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, androgen receptor (AR) signaling,
and activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, but it is uncertain how they may become coordinated during
progression to castration-resistant disease that remains incurable. The mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is
elevated in prostate cancer, where its expression is linked to tumor grade. Notably, Plk1 signaling and lipid
metabolism were identiﬁed recently as two of the top ﬁve most upregulated pathways in a mouse xenograft model
of human prostate cancer. Herein, we show that oxidative stress activates both the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway
and AR signaling in a Plk1-dependent manner in prostate cells. Inhibition of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway
prevented oxidative stress-induced activation of AR signaling. Plk1 modulation also affected cholesteryl ester
accumulation in prostate cancer via the SREBP pathway. Finally, Plk1 inhibition enhanced cellular responses to
androgen signaling inhibitors (ASI) and overcame ASI resistance in both cultured prostate cancer cells and
patient-derived tumor xenografts. Given that activation of AR signaling and the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway is
sufﬁcient to elevate SREBP-dependent expression of key lipid biosynthesis enzymes in castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC), our ﬁndings argued that Plk1 activation was responsible for coordinating and driving
these processes to promote and sustain the development of this advanced stage of disease. Overall, our results
offer a strong mechanistic rationale to evaluate Plk1 inhibitors in combination drug trials to enhance the efﬁcacy
of ASIs in CRPC. Cancer Res; 74(22); 6635–47. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death due to
cancer in males in the United States, with 233,000 news cases
and 29,480 deaths estimated in 2014 (1). Treatment options for
late-stage disease are limited. Androgen-deprivation therapy is
initially effective, but remissions are temporary and the disease
eventually progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). Evidence from experimental and clinical studies suggests that prostate cancer cells are exposed to increased
oxidative stress. A potential role for reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in the regulation of cellular processes controlling malignant transformation holds a lot of promise in understanding
prostate cancer, as this will open doors for the development of

novel therapeutics for the disease (2). Besides acting as a DNAdamaging agent, moderately elevated levels of ROS may act as
secondary messengers that contribute to the oncogenic phenotype by activating many transcription factors and signaling
pathways. Therefore, identiﬁcation of prostate-speciﬁc signaling pathways in response to oxidative stress will provide novel
targets for treatment options (2).
The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical effector of prostate
cancer development and progression. In response to androgen,
activated AR is translocated from the cytoplasm into the
nucleus, acting as a transcription factor that activates many
downstream proteins, such as prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA).
Enough evidence suggests that AR signaling continues to be
essential for prostate cancer development even after castration. In support, current approaches to treat CRPC are to delay
or replace treatment with cytotoxic agents, such as docetaxel,
with androgen signaling inhibitors (ASI), such as abiraterone
and enzalutamide (previously MDV3100; refs. 3, 4). However,
overall survival was only improved by 5 or 2 months in the
recent phase III trials that compared abiraterone or enzalutamide with placebo in patients with CRPC (4–6). Therefore,
new mechanism-based studies are urgently needed to identify
targets and strategies to overcome ASI resistance, thus achieving effective management of CRPC.
It has been established that the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway
plays a critical role in prostate cancer cell survival. The PI3Ks
are enzymes that are responsible for generation of the second
messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) that

activates AKT, which mediates activation of the mTOR complex, a kinase that controls protein translation via activation of
S6K and S6. The tumor-suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and
tensin homolog) acts as a major antagonist to the PI3K
pathway. Although prostate-speciﬁc knockout of PTEN leads
to invasive prostate cancer and ultimately to metastatic cancer
in mice (7), loss-of-function PTEN mutations are detected in
less than 5% of primary prostate tumors, suggesting that
additional mechanisms might be responsible for activation of
the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway in prostate cancer.
Increasing evidence in recent years suggests that deregulation of lipid metabolism is another hallmark of prostate cancer.
For example, high contents of both free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters (CE) of prostate tissues correlate with the
presence of malignancy, likely due to abnormalities in lipid
homeostasis (8). Key players in the regulation of lipid metabolism are the sterol regulatory element binding proteins
(SREBP), a family of three transcription factors (SREBP-1a,
SREBP-1c, SREBP-2) that are attached to the endoplasmic
reticulum as inactive forms. When sterol levels are low, SREBPs
will be activated by SREBP-cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)
to drive expression of enzymes needed for lipid synthesis, such
as fatty acid synthase (FAS), HMGCoA-R, and low-density
lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R; 9). Of note, both the PI3K–
AKT–mTOR and AR pathways act upstream of the SREBP
pathway, resulting in elevation of lipid synthesis (Fig. 7; refs. 10,
11). Cholesterol can serve as a precursor to drive de novo
steroidogenesis to increase intratumoral androgen levels, thus
activating AR signaling (12). Cholesterol, combined with
increased levels of fatty acid, will also increase the formation
of lipid rafts, which have documented roles in activation of the
PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway and cell migration (Fig. 7). Despite
all these progresses, whether and how oxidative stress and
various signaling pathways are coordinated to contribute to
CRPC is not known.
Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a regulator of many cell-cycle
events, such as mitotic entry and cytokinesis (13). A close
correlation between the level of Plk1 expression and prognosis
has been documented. Therefore, it has been proposed that
inhibition of Plk1 is an important strategy for enhancement of
cancer therapy (13). Indeed, the Plk1 inhibitor BI2536 is in
phase II clinical studies for patients with various cancers.
Signiﬁcantly, Plk1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and is
linked to higher grade tumors, suggesting that Plk1 is involved
in tumorigenesis and progression in this tumor entity (14).
Furthermore, RNAi-mediated Plk1 knockdown causes induction of mitotic catastrophe in prostate cancer cells, suggesting
that Plk1 might be a target for prostate cancer management
(14). Of note, Plk1 and lipid metabolism are two of the top ﬁve
most-upregulated pathways after castration in a microarray
analysis of a prostate cancer xenograft model (15). However,
the molecular mechanisms responsible for these encouraging
observations are still undeﬁned. Our data explain how castration-associated Plk1 elevation induces activation of the
PI3K–AKT–mTOR and AR pathways and increase of lipid
biosynthesis, eventually resulting in CRPC. Our ﬁnding supports the notion that inhibition of Plk1 is a novel avenue to
enhance the efﬁcacy of ASI in CRPC.

Plk1 in CRPC

Figure 1. Oxidative stress activates the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway in a Plk1-dependent manner in prostate cells. A, genetic backgrounds of prostate cells
used in the study. B, moderate oxidative stress leads to increased levels of Plk1 in prostate cancer cells. PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with or
without 1 mmol/L of H2O2 for 5 minutes and harvested for anti-Plk1 immunoblotting. C, inhibition of oxidative stress leads to reduced levels of Plk1
protein. RWPE-1, LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cells were treated with or without 20 mmol/L of diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH
oxidase, in the presence of 200 ng/mL of nocodazole for 10 hours and harvested. D and E, oxidative stress activates the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway in RWPE-1
cells. RWPE-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 for 10 minutes (the left four lanes in D) or with 1 mmol/L of H2O2 for different times (the
right four lanes in D and E) as indicated and harvested for anti-p-AKT immunoblotting. F, oxidative stress activates the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway in multiple
prostate cell lines. RWPE-1, LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cells were treated with 1 mmol/L of H2O2 for 5 minutes and harvested. G, PC3 cells were treated with
diamide for various conditions as indicated. H and I, oxidative stress–induced activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway is Plk1 dependent. RWPE-1 (H) or
PC3 (I) cells were depleted of Plk1 by infection with lentivirus. After selection for infection-positive cells with puromycin for 36 hours, cells were treated with 1
mmol/L of H2O2 for 5 minutes and harvested for immunoblotting or FACS. I, right, cells were treated with or without nocodazoel (Noc.) for 12 hours before
treatment with H2O2. J, inhibition of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway did not affect oxidative stress–induced elevation of Plk1 protein. PC3 cells were
preincubated with two inhibitors of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathways (25 mmol/L of LY294002 for 1 hour or 100 nmol/L of rapamycin for 2 hours), treated with 1
mmol/L H2O2 for 5 minutes, and harvested for immunoblotting. K and L, oxidative stress–induced elevation of Plk1 is NF-kB dependent. PC3 or LNCaP cells
were incubated with 100 mmol/L of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) for 10 minutes, treated with or without 1 mmol/L of H2O2 for 5 minutes, and harvested
for RT-PCR to measure Plk1 mRNA levels (K) or to immunoblot with antibodies indicated (L). M, oxidative stress–induced activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR

Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extract preparations
Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared
with a kit from ActiveMotif (catalog no., 40410) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoﬂuorescent staining
Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes,
washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 PBS, and permeabilized with
methanol for 2 minutes. Upon wash with 0.1% Triton X-100
PBS, cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS
for 10 minutes, and incubated with anti-AR antibody for 2
hours at room temperature, followed by incubation with Alexa
Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG (HþL) secondary antibody
(Invitrogen; A21424) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Sigma) for 1 hour.
Depletion and overexpression of Plk1
HEK293T cells in 10-cm dishes were cotransfected with 4
mg of pHR'-CMV-DR 8.20vpr, 2 mg of pHR'-CMV-VSV-G, and 4
mg of pLKO.1-Plk1 for depletion of Plk1 or LV-CMV-Plk1 for
overexpression of Plk1. Supernatants were collected every 12
hours after 24 hours of transfection. Viruses were ﬁltered
through a 0.45-mm pore size ﬁlter, concentrated by spin at
20,000 rpm for 2 hours, resuspended in TNE buffer (50
mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, 130 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA), and rotated overnight at 4 C. Infections were carried
out in the presence of 10 mg/mL of polybrene and 10 mmol/L
of HEPES, followed by selection with 1 mg/mL of puromycin
for at least 36 hours.
Cholesteryl ester measurement by Raman spectrometry
CE measurement by Raman spectrometry was performed
with a compound Raman microscope as described previously
(8).
Patient-derived xenograft model
Mice carrying LuCaP35CR tumors were obtained from Dr.
Robert Vessella at University of Washington (Seattle, WA;
ref. 16). Tumors were ampliﬁed by cutting the original tumors
into about 20 to 30 mm3 pieces and then implanted into
precastrated nude mice. After amplifying enough tumors,
tumors were harvested and cut into about 20 to 30 mm3 pieces
before implanting into 16 precastrated nude mice. When
tumors reached 250 to 300 mm3, mice were randomly separated into four groups (four mice in each group) for different
treatments. Tumor volume was calculated as length 
width2/2. BI2536 was dissolved in 0.1 mol/L HCl and then
diluted in 0.9% NaCl for injection. Blood was collected once a
week and serum PSA level was measured using the PSA ELISA
Kit (Abnova; KA0208).

Results
Plk1 acts upstream of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway
during oxidative stress
To understand how Plk1 is involved in CRPC, we treated
prostate cells with oxidative stress, as castration induces
oxidative stress in vivo, and treatment with hydrogen per-

oxide (H2O2) can partially mimic cellular events after castration. Genetic backgrounds of different prostate cell lines
we used in this study are indicated in Fig. 1A. Treatment of
two prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, with H2O2
led to increased levels of Plk1 (Fig. 1B). In agreement,
inhibition of oxidative stress with diphenyleneiodonium
chloride reduced the levels of Plk1 in multiple prostate cell
lines, including RWPE-1, a nontransformed prostate cell
line that is established by transfection with a single copy of
the human papilloma virus 18 into epithelial cells derived
from the peripheral zone of a histologically normal adult
human prostate (Fig. 1C). Considering that the PI3K–AKT–
mTOR pathway has an established role in prostate cancer,
we next asked whether oxidative stress results in activation
of this pathway as well. As indicated in Fig. 1D–F, treatment
of cells with H2O2 led to phosphorylation of AKT in multiple
prostate cell lines, including RWPE-1. We also asked whether oxidative stress other than H2O2 can cause activation of
the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway as well. Diamide oxidizes
cellular thiols, especially protein-integrated cysteines, provoked a rapid decrease in cellular glutathione, hence caused
oxidative stress. Diamide treatment also activated the
PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway in PC3 cells (Fig. 1G).
Having established that oxidative stress leads to elevation
of Plk1 and activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, we
next asked whether these two events are interrelated and
interdependent. Toward that end, we used lentivirus-based
RNAi to deplete Plk1 in different prostate cell lines, and
found that depletion of Plk1 caused a reduction of the levels
of phospho-AKT (S473) and phospho-S6, either in the
absence or presence of oxidative stress, suggesting that Plk1
acts upstream of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway (Fig. 1H
and I). As a control, we showed that the short treatment with
H2O2 did not affect cell-cycle progression, ruling out the
possibility oxidative stress–induced elevation of Plk1 might
be a secondary effect of cell-cycle arrest (Fig. 1I, right). To
further conﬁrm that oxidative stress–induced activation of
AKT is Plk1 dependent, we also inhibited the PI3K–AKT–
mTOR pathway with various inhibitors, and found that these
inhibitors did not affect oxidative stress–induced elevation
of Plk1, supporting that the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway acts
downstream of Plk1 (Fig. 1J). Mechanistically, oxidative
stress–induced Plk1 elevation and activation of the PI3K
pathway are NF-kB dependent, as addition of pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate, an NF-kB inhibitor, counteracted the
effect (Fig. 1K–M). In agreement with that NF-kB is a
transcription factor, oxidative stress also results in an elevation of mRNA level of Plk1 (Fig. 1K). Involvement of NF-kB
is also supported by its increased phosphorylation upon
oxidative stress (Fig. 1L). As a control, we showed that the
nuclear localization of NF-kB was increased upon oxidative
stress (Fig. 1N). NF-kB, a transcription factor that regulates a
spectrum of biologic responses, is activated by a variety of
stimuli, such as radiation and oxidative stress (17). Certain
cell types, but certainly not all, respond to oxidative stress by
upregulation of NF-kB activity. Our data suggest that NF-kB
plays a critical role in prostate cells in response to oxidative
stress (Fig. 1K–M). How NF-kB affects Plk1 expression has

Plk1 in CRPC

Figure 2. Oxidative stress–induced AR elevation in prostate cancer cells is Plk1 dependent. A, oxidative stress results in elevation of AR level. LNCaP cells were
treated with or without 1 mmol/L of H2O2 for 5 minutes and harvested for anti-AR immunoblotting or RT-PCR. B, inhibition of oxidative stress
reduces AR levels in prostate cancer cells. LNCaP, C4-2, and 22Rv-1 cells were treated with 20 mmol/L of diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) for
24 hours and harvested. C and D, overexpression of Plk1 increases the level of AR protein. C, LNCaP cells were infected with lentivirus that expresses
Plk1 for 24 hours, treated with 20 mmol/L DPI for 12 hours, and harvested. D, C4-2 cells were infected with lentivirus to deplete or overexpress Plk1 for
24 hours and harvested. E and F, inhibition of Plk1 prevents oxidative stress–induced elevation of AR protein. LNCaP cells were preincubated with or without
100 nmol/L of BI2536 for 2 hours, treated with 1 mmol/L of H2O2 for 5 minutes (E) or 1 mmol/L of diamide for 5 minutes (F), and harvested. G, AR of C4-2 cells
are more sensitive to inhibition of Plk1 than AR of LNCaP cells. LNCaP or C4-2 cells were treated with MG132  BI2536 and harvested. H, inhibition
of Plk1 decreases the level of nuclear AR. After LNCaP cells were treated with 100 nmol/L of BI2536 for 2 hours, lysates were subjected to subcellular
fractionation to obtain cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions, followed by anti-AR immunoblotting. Only half of cytoplasmic fractions were loaded
because of the limited volumes of gel wells. I, inhibition of Plk1 decreases AR expression under oxidative stress. LNCaP cells were incubated with 100 nmol/L
of BI2536 for 8 hours, treated with 1 mmol/L of H2O2 or 1 mmol/L of diamide for 5 minutes, and harvested for subcellular fractionation. Cytoplasmic and
nuclear fractions were analyzed by anti-AR immunoblotting. Only half of cytoplasmic fractions were loaded because of the limited volumes of gel wells.
To quantify, we set the intensities of non-BI2536–treated lanes to be 1.0. J, inhibition of Plk1 decreases nuclear AR intensity. LNCaP cells were preincubated
with or without 100 nmol/L of BI2536 for 2 hours, treated with 100 nmol/L of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 2 hours, and harvested for anti-AR
immunoﬂuorescent staining. K, BI2536 inhibits AR activity. LNCaP cells were treated with different concentrations of BI2536, followed by luciferase assay to
measure AR activity. L and M, inhibition of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway antagonizes the oxidative stress–induced activation of AR. LNCaP (L) and C4-2 (M)
cells were preincubated with the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway inhibitors (25 mmol/L of LY294002 for 1 hour, 5 mmol/L of MK-2206 for 2 hours, or 100 nmol/L of
rapamycin for 2 hours), treated with 1 mmol/L of H2O2 for 5 minutes, and harvested. N, inhibition of Plk1 and AKT reduced the level of nuclear Twist
protein in C4-2 cells. O, BI2536 inhibits Twist1 activity. C4-2 cells were treated with BI2536 (10 nmol/L, 12 hours), MK2206 (20 nmol/L, 6 hours), insulin (1 nmol/
L, 6 hours), or BI2536 plus insulin, and harvested for RT-PCR to measure mRNA levels of CLU (clusterin) and AR, two transcription targets of Twist1.

been described previously (18). Plk1 is a transcriptional
target of the RelA subunit of NF-kB and upregulation of
Plk1 induced by cell detachment is RelA dependent (18). Our
ﬁnding suggests that NF-kB might be responsible for elevation of Plk1 in CRPC in which the constitutive activation
of NF-kB is observed (19).
Oxidative stress induces activation of AR signaling in a
Plk1-dependent manner
In addition to the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, continued
activation of AR signaling contributes to CRPC. We therefore
asked whether oxidative stress leads to activation of AR
signaling in vitro. Treatment of LNCaP cells with H2O2
resulted in elevation of both AR protein and mRNA (Fig.
2A), whereas inhibition of oxidative stress with diphenyleneiodonium chloride led to decreased levels of AR in multiple prostate cancer cell lines, including two CRPC cell lines,
C4-2 and 22Rv1 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that oxidative stress is
likely one contributing factor that activates AR signaling in
CRPC. We then asked whether oxidative stress–associated
AR activation is Plk1 dependent with different approaches.
Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Plk1 increased the
expression levels of AR in LNCaP cells either in the presence
or absence of diphenyleneiodonium chloride (Fig. 2C). Plk1
overexpression led to an increase of AR protein in C4-2 cells
as well (Fig. 2D). In agreement, BI2536-mediated inhibition
of Plk1 decreased the expression levels of AR in LNCaP cells
either in presence or absence of oxidative stress (Fig. 2E and
F). We also noticed that AR level of C4-2 cells was much
more sensitive to BI2536 than that of LNCaP cells, indicating
that Plk1 likely plays a more important role in late-stage
prostate cancer (Fig. 2G). Considering that AR is a transcription factor, which has to shuttle into the nucleus to
control its downstream targets, we also analyzed its subcellular localization by fractionation upon inhibition of Plk1. As
indicated, inhibition of Plk1 by BI2536 led to reduced levels
of nuclear AR either in the absence (Fig. 2H) or presence of
oxidative stress (Fig. 2I). The reduced levels of nuclear AR
upon inhibition of Plk1 under different cellular conditions,
such as oxidative stress and dihydrotestosterone treatment,
were also conﬁrmed by anti-AR immunoﬂuorescent staining
(Fig. 2J). Furthermore, treatment of LNCaP cells with BI2536
inhibited AR transactivation activity in a dose-dependent
manner in the AR luciferase assay (Fig. 2K). Because oxidative stress activates both the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway and
AR signaling, we asked whether these two pathways regulate
each other under this condition. As indicated in Fig. 2L and
M, treatment of LNCaP and C4-2 cells with various inhibitors
of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway signiﬁcantly antagonized
oxidative stress–induced AR activation. Therefore, the PI3K–
AKT–mTOR pathway also contributes to AR activation upon
oxidative stress. To understand the underlying mechanism
of this observation, we turned our attention to Twist1
transcription factor. It was shown that AKT phosphorylation
of Twist1 at S42 leads to its activation to promote cell
survival during carcinogenesis (20), and that activated
Twist1 increases AR expression through binding to E-boxes
in AR promoter region upon castration-induced oxidative

stress (21). Because Twist1 is an important mediator
between AKT and AR, we asked whether inhibition of Plk1
affects the nuclear accumulation of Twist1. As indicated,
treatment of C4-2 cells with both BI2536 and MK2206 led to
an obvious reduction of nuclear Twist1 protein level (Fig.
2N). Of interest, the cytosolic fraction of Twist1 was apparently increased upon treatment with BI2536 and MK2206
(Fig. 2N), suggesting that it is the nuclear localization of
Twist1 that is regulated by Plk1 and AKT. Finally, BI2536
treatment clearly inhibited insulin-induced transcription of
CLU and AR, two Twsit1 targets (Fig. 2O), in agreement with
a reduced protein level of nuclear Twist1 (Fig. 2N).
Plk1 affects cholesterol metabolism in prostate cancer
cells via the SREBP pathway
To conﬁrm that Plk1 regulates AR signaling, we then analyzed the status of the SREBP pathway upon inhibition of Plk1
with BI2536. Treatment of LNCaP and C4-2 cells with BI2536
led to reduced levels of cleaved forms of SREBP2 (Fig. 3A) and
SREBP1 (Fig. 3B). To ask whether this observation is limited to
AR-positive cells, we also performed a series of Western blot
analyses with antibodies against SREBP1/2 in PC3 and DU145
cells. Inhibition of Plk1 with BI2536 also reduced the expression levels of cleaved forms of SREBP2 (Fig. 3C) and SREBP1
(Fig. 3D) in PC3 and DU145 cells, suggesting that BI2536induced downregulation of the SREBP pathway is likely a
general phenomenon in prostate cancer. To further conﬁrm
this, we tested whether inhibition of Plk1 affects the downstream targets of SREBP. As indicated in Fig. 3E, BI2536
treatment led to reduced transcription levels of FAS, mevalonate kinase (MVK), and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
reductase (HMGCR), three targets of SREBP, supported by
decreased levels of proteins upon BI2536 treatment (Fig. 3F). Of
note, 4-hour treatment with BI2536 is enough for us to detect
signiﬁcant reductions of these genes in C4-2 cells, whereas 24
hours are needed to observe an apparent inhibition in LNCaP
cells (Fig. 3E), suggesting that androgen-independent C4-2
cells are much more sensitive to BI2536 than androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Considering that SREBP is also regulated by
the Fbw7–GSK3b pathway and that AKT-associated phosphorylation suppresses GSK3b, we thus tested whether BI2536 also
affects the activation of GSK3b. As indicated in Fig. 3G,
inhibition of Plk1 also reduced phosphorylation level of GSK3b,
suggesting that the AKT–GSK3b axis might be also involved in
Plk1-dependent activation of the SREBP pathway. Furthermore, to answer the question whether a general decay of
cellular protein is the cause for reduced AR and FAS levels
following BI2536 treatment, we performed a time-course
experiment in which an apoptosis analysis was included.
BI2536 treatment led to reduced levels of AR and FAS after
8 hours of incubation, but cell death was not detected until 12
hours, ruling out the possibility that Plk1 inhibition-induced
reduction of AR and FAS levels in LNCaP cells is a secondary
effect of cell death (Fig. 3H). For C4-2 cells, as short as 4 hours of
BI2536 treatment is enough for us to detect apparent reduction
of AR and FAS levels.
Using a stimulated Raman scattering microscope, we
recently reported that the high-grade prostate cancer tissues

Plk1 in CRPC

Figure 3. Plk1 affects lipid metabolism in prostate cancer. A, inhibition of Plk1 reduces the active (cleaved) form of SREBP2. LNCaP and C4-2 cells were treated
with BI2536 and harvested for immunoblotting. B, inhibition of Plk1 reduces the active (cleaved) form of SREBP1. C4-2 cells were treated with
BI2536, followed by subcellular fractionation. C and D, inhibition of Plk1 decreases the protein levels of active forms of SREBP1/2 in PC3 and DU145
cells. Cells were treated with or without 100 nmol/L of BI2536 for 12 hours and harvested for immunoblotting with antibodies against SREBP2 (C) or SREBP1
(D). E and F, BI2536 inhibits the SREBP pathway. E, LNCaP (top) and C4-2 (bottom) cells were treated with 10nmol/L BI2536 for 4 or 24 hours and harvested for
real-time qPCR to measure the mRNA levels of three SREBP-regulated genes. F, PC3 and LNCaP cells were treated with BI2536 and harvested for
immunoblotting. G, BI2536 inhibits phosphorylation of GSK3b. Cells were treated with BI2536 and harvested. H, Plk1 inhibition-induced reduction of AR and
FAS levels occurs before massive apoptosis. LNCaP cells were treated with BI2536 for different time and harvested for immunoblotting. I, inhibition of Plk1
blocks the accumulation of CE in PC3 cells. PC3 cells were treated with different concentrations of BI2536 for 60 hours and subjected to Raman microscopic
analysis. The arrow at bottom indicates the 702 per cm peak due to cholesterol ring vibration. J, overexpression of Plk1 increases CE accumulation. PC3 cells
were infected with GFP-Plk1–expressing lentivirus for 24 or 48 hours and subjected to Raman microscopic analysis. The ratio of intensity of the CE peak 702
per cm versus intensity of the peak 1442 per cm in each cell was calculated. Ten cells from each group were randomly selected for CE measurement. K and L,
oxidative stress increases CE accumulation. LNCaP cells were treated with or without 1 mmol/L of diamide for 5 minutes and subjected to Raman microscopic
analysis. Ten cells from each group were randomly chosen to calculate the ratio of intensity of the CE peak 702 per cm versus intensity of the peak 1442 per cm
in each cell. M, inhibition of steroidogenesis antagonizes oxidative stress–induced AR elevation. LNCaP cells, growing in RPMI-1640 medium with 5%
charcoal-stripped FBS, were preincubated with 1 mmol/L of abiraterone for 24 hours, treated with 20 mmol/L of diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) for 12 hours
or 1 mmol/L of H2O2 for 5 minutes, and harvested for anti-AR immunoblotting. N and O, inhibition of lipid rafts decreases activation of AKT. PC3 (N) or DU145

contained signiﬁcantly more CE than the low-grade ones,
suggesting an important correlation of CE accumulation with
prostate cancer progression (8). Of signiﬁcance, inhibition of
Plk1 reduced the level of CE in PC3 cells in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 3I), suggesting that Plk1 acts upstream
of cholesterol synthesis during prostate cancer progression. In
support, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Plk1 increased
CE accumulation in PC3 cells (Fig. 3J), conﬁrming that Plk1
acts upstream of cholesterol biosynthesis in prostate cancer
progression. We next asked whether oxidative stress affects CE
accumulation in prostate cancer. As expected, diamide treatment increased the level of CE in PC3 cells (Fig. 3K and L).
Because Plk1-associated kinase activity affects cholesterol
metabolism and because cholesterol is the precursor of androgen during de novo steroidogenesis, we asked whether there is a
positive feedback loop between AR signaling and cholesterol
biosynthesis (Fig. 7). In other words, Plk1-mediated activation
of AR signaling increases cholesterol biosynthesis via the
SREBP pathway, and elevation of cholesterol levels further
activates AR signaling via de novo androgen biosynthesis. As
indicated, treatment with abiraterone, an inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis, prevented oxidative stress–induced activation of AR signaling, suggesting a positive feedback loop (Fig.
3M). For the similar reason, we also asked whether there is
another positive feedback loop between the PI3K–AKT–mTOR
pathway and lipid synthesis (Fig. 7). In other words, Plk1mediated activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway
increases lipid synthesis via the SREBP pathway, and elevation
of fatty acid and cholesterol levels further activates the PI3K–
AKT–mTOR pathway in lipid rafts. As indicated, treatment
with the lipid raft–disrupting agent, ﬁlipin, a polyene macrolide that binds cholesterol with high speciﬁcity, reduced oxidative stress–induced activation of AKT, supporting a positive
feedback loop as well (Fig. 3N and O).
AR positively regulates Plk1
Given that AR is a transfection factor, we also asked whether
AR regulates the level of Plk1. As indicated, AR expression in
PC3 and 293T cells led to elevation of Plk1 transcription (Fig.
4A) and AR depletion in LNCaP and C4-2 cells resulted in
reduction of Plk1 protein (Fig. 4B). We acknowledge that recent
evidence suggests that AR-vs that lack the functional ligandbinding domain (LBD) also play important roles in resistance
to ASI in CRPC (22–24). AR-vs originate from AR transcripts
with insertions of cryptic exons downstream of the coding
sequences for AR DNA-binding domain (e.g., AR-v7) or with
deletions of exons coding for AR-LBD (e.g., AR-v567es). Microarray data show that AR-WT and AR-vs mediate distinctive
transcriptional programs, as AR-vs preferentially induce elevation of cell-cycle genes, including Plk1 (22). Thus, we asked
whether depletion of AR-vs affects the level of Plk1. As indicated, depletion of both AR-V7 and AR-V1 caused obvious
reduction of the levels of Plk1 protein (Fig. 4C, top) and mRNA
(Fig. 4C, bottom).
Inhibition of Plk1 potentiates the effect of ASI
Because Plk1 elevation leads to constitutive activation of
AR, the major mechanism for development of resistance of

6642

Cancer Res; 74(22) November 15, 2014

ASI, we performed a series of experiments to ask whether
ASI and BI2536 inhibit AR signaling in CRPC cells in a
synergistic manner. A combination of low concentrations
of abiraterone and BI2536 resulted in a much more dramatic
reduction of protein levels of AR-WT in C4-2 (Fig. 4D) and
AR-vs in 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 4E). Moreover, a combination of
low concentrations of enzalutamide (MDV3100) and BI2536
also led to a more signiﬁcant reduction of AR-WT in C4-2
(Fig. 4F) and AR-vs in 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 4G). Of note, elevation
of AR-vs has been reported to contribute to resistance to
inhibition of AR signaling in CRPC (23, 24). Thus, the data
in Fig. 4E and G suggest that a combination of BI2536 and
ASI could be a novel avenue to overcome ASI-resistance due
to elevation of AR-vs. Next, we performed ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to follow any cell-cycle
defect upon drug treatment. As indicated, the presence of
enzalutamide potentiated BI2536-induced G2–M arrest in
22Rv1 cells (Fig. 4H). Furthermore, a combination of BI2536
and enzalutamide strongly antagonized R1881-induced
nuclear accumulation of AR in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4I). We
also asked whether BI2536 and enzalutamide act synergistically in LNCaP cells by measuring the combination index
(CI) with the following equation: CI ¼ (Am)50/(As)50 þ
(Bm)50/(Bs)50, where (Am)50 is the IC50 of drug A in the
combination, (As)50 is the concentration of drug A that will
produce the identical level of effect alone, (Bm)50 is the IC50
of drug B in the combination, and (Bs)50 is the IC50 of drug B
after single administration. Antagonism is indicated when CI
> 1, CI ¼ 1 indicates an additive effect, and CI < 1 indicates
synergy. Our calculations led to a CI value of 0.12, suggesting
that BI2536 and enzalutamide act synergistically to induce
apoptosis (Fig. 4J). Finally, androgen treatment of LNCaP
cells growing in charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (CSS)
medium apparently stimulated Plk1 expression, and enzalutamide treatment of LNCaP cells culturing in normal
medium inhibited the expression level of Plk1, further conﬁrming that Plk1 is an AR target (Fig. 4K).
Inhibition of Plk1 overcomes ASI resistance
Next, we treated MR49F cells, the enzalutamide-resistant
LNCaP cells (25), with enzalutamide and BI2536 and found
that MR49F cells became much more sensitive to enzalutamide in the presence of BI2536, indicated by an almost
complete disappearance of AR protein and a huge increase
of c-PARP (Fig. 5A and B). Furthermore, treatment with
BI2536 plus enzalutamide led to a much stronger G2–M
arrest and androgen-induced AR nuclear localization than
monotherapy in MR49F cells (Fig. 5C and D). Finally, the
castration-resistant LuCaP35CR xenograft tumors, directly
derived from human patients with CRPC (24), were used to
test the efﬁcacy of the combination of BI2536 and abiraterone. As indicated, the combination of BI2536 and abiraterone almost completely blocked tumor growth and elevation
of serum PSA. In striking contrast, monotherapies with low
concentrations of BI2536 or abiraterone did not signiﬁcantly
affect tumor growth and serum PSA levels (Fig. 6A–D). To
support our cell culture–based data, the levels of testosterone, the precursor of dihydrotestosterone, were reduced in

reported that the major component of lipid droplets in
prostate cancer was found to be CE (26).

Discussion
Oxidative stress in prostate cancer
Evidence from both experimental and clinical studies suggests that prostate cancer cells are exposed to increased oxidative stress (2, 27). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that
oxidative stress is inherent in prostate cancer cells (28). Therefore, understanding how ROS regulate cellular processes controlling transformation during the progression of prostate cancer will open doors for the development of novel therapeutics for
prostate cancer (2). In particular, castration, the major approach
for treatment of late-stage prostate cancer (29), signiﬁcantly
increases oxidative stress of the prostate (21, 27, 30). However,
whether and how castration-induced oxidative stress contributes to CRPC is still elusive. Herein, we provide evidence to
show that oxidative stress led to activation of the PI3K–AKT–
mTOR pathway (Fig. 1), activation of AR signaling (Fig. 2), and
elevation of cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 3), three hallmarks of
CRPC. Of note, Plk1 turns out to be a critical molecule that links
all these prostate cancer–speciﬁc signaling pathways. We
understand that 1 mmol/L H2O2 treatment might not be
physiologic relevance. We initially chose such treatment, as
used previously (31), to establish a link among oxidative stress,
Plk1, and signaling pathways that are involved in prostate
cancer. Additional experiments without H2O2 treatment further
conﬁrmed that Plk1-associated kinase activity activates these
pathways is a general phenomenon.
ASI in CRPC treatment
CRPC remains an incurable disease today. AR antagonists,
such as bicalutamide and nilutamide, have been used in
CRPC for three decades. Unfortunately, the duration of
response to these anti-androgens is often less than 4
months; their AR binding is reversible, and paradoxical
agonism of the AR occurs in 10% to 15% of patients (32).
Two most recently FDA-approved drugs to treat CRPC are
abiraterone and enzalutamide, which improve overall survival for 5 and 2 months, respectively (4, 5). Although
abiraterone acetate blocks de novo androgen biosynthesis
from cholesterol, enzalutamide is a direct AR inhibitor. On
the basis of mutual regulation of Plk1 and AR, we hypothesized that inhibition of Plk1 might be a novel approach to
overcome resistance to ASI (Fig. 7). Both cell culture–based
in vitro assays and patient-derived xenograft tumor experiments led to the conclusion that inhibition of Plk1 significantly enhanced the efﬁcacy of ASI in CRPC. Because BI2536
has been well tolerated by patients in clinical trials, and
because we used much lower concentrations of BI2536 and
ASI than the previous publications, the data presented here
support an immediate clinical trial with a combination of
BI2536 and ASI to improve the treatment of CRPC.
Plk1 in drug resistance
Increasing evidence suggests that Plk1 has many nonmitotic
functions. In particular, Plk1 is signiﬁcantly elevated in inter-

6644

Cancer Res; 74(22) November 15, 2014

phase of transformed cells, but not in normal cells, suggesting
that Plk1 must have cancer cell–speciﬁc functions (33). In
support, elevation of Plk1 leads to inactivation of tumorsuppressor p53 via its kinase activity toward GTSE1 and
Topors, two negative regulators of p53 (34, 35). Because many
chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin, act via p53dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, Plk1 elevation has
been proposed to contribute to development of

lication stress such as gemcitabine (39–41). The data presented here demonstrated that Plk1 also plays a critical role
in cellular response to ASI and that inhibition of Plk1
overcomes ASI resistance in CRPC. Although how Plk1
elevation leads to activation of AR signaling and elevation
of cholesterol biosynthesis are currently under heavy investigation in the Liu laboratory, we recently reported one
mechanism that is responsible for Plk1-dependent activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway. We showed that Plk1
phosphorylation of PTEN-S385 leads to its inactivation, thus
activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway (42).
