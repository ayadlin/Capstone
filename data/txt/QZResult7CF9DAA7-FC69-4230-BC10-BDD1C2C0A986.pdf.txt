ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common brain tumor with poor survival rate.
Our results show that penfluridol, an antipsychotic drug significantly reduced the
survival of ten adult and pediatric glioblastoma cell lines with IC50 ranging 2–5 µM after
72 hours of treatment and induced apoptosis. Penfluridol treatment suppressed the
phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and reduced the expression of GLI1, OCT4, Nanog and
Sox2 in several glioblastoma cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibiting
Akt with LY294002 and siRNA, or inhibiting GLI1 using GANT61, cyclopamine, siRNA
and CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in enhanced cell growth suppressive effects of penfluridol.
On the other hand, overexpression of GLI1 significantly attenuated the effects of
penfluridol. Our results further demonstrated that penfluridol treatment inhibited
the growth of U87MG tumors by 65% and 72% in subcutaneous and intracranial
in vivo glioblastoma tumor models respectively. Immunohistochemical and western
blot analysis of tumors revealed reduced pAkt (Ser 473), GLI1, OCT4 and increase in
caspase-3 cleavage and TUNEL staining, confirming in vitro findings. Taken together,
our results indicate that overall glioblastoma tumor growth suppression by penfluridol
was associated with Akt-mediated inhibition of GLI1.

INTRODUCTION

factor, belonging to sonic hedgehog pathway is over
expressed in glioblastoma tumors [2]. GLI1 has also
been shown to exhibit cancer stem cell property by
overexpressing stem cell markers like OCT4, Nanog
and Sox2. It has also been established that resistance of
glioblastoma tumors to current therapies are related to
overexpression of GLI1 [3]. Recently, PI3K/Akt mediated
non-canonical activation of GLI1 has also been shown in
renal cell carcinoma [4].
Published studies have shown reduced risk of
cancer incidence in patients taking neuroleptic drugs [5].
Interestingly, thioridazine, an antipsychotic drug has been
reported to inhibit glioblastoma tumor growth by inducing
autophagy [6]. However, thioridazine is associated
with severe cardiac toxicity thus preventing its clinical
use [7]. Penfluridol is an oral antipsychotic drug used for
schizophrenia. We have recently demonstrated that oral
administration of penfluridol significantly suppresses
the growth of metastatic breast tumors in brain, giving
us the rationale to evaluate it against highly aggressive
glioblastoma [8].

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the highly
malignant and incurable brain tumors. The median
survival rate of glioblastoma patients is only 12%.
Despite availability of several therapeutic alternatives,
glioblastoma still claims thousands of lives each year.
Three major obstacles which exist in current treatment
strategies for glioblastoma are (a) recurrence of tumor
within six months after surgical removal (b) development
of resistance to chemotherapies, and (c) inability of the
drugs to cross blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in order to
reach the brain. Due to lack of effective treatment, 88%
of glioblastoma patients succumb to death within three
years after diagnosis. Currently, glioblastoma is like a
death sentence to the patients. Hence, it is critical to find
new treatment options against this deadly disease.
Despite several advances, little is known about
oncogenic signaling in glioblastoma. Hedgehog signaling
pathway plays a critical role in glioblastoma tumor
progression and pathogenesis [1]. GLI1, a transcription

In the current study, we observed that penfluridol
treatment significantly suppressed the growth of ten
different glioblastoma cell lines. Our results showed Aktmediated suppression of GLI1 with penfluridol treatment
in various glioblastoma cell lines. Oral administration
of penfluridol significantly suppressed the growth of
subcutaneous and intracranial glioblastoma tumors through
mechanism similar to what we observed in the in vitro
experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study reporting suppression of glioblastoma tumor growth
by penfluridol through Akt-mediated inhibition of GLI1.

phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and the expression of GLI1
in a concentration-dependent manner in all the cell lines
tested (Figure 3A–3C and Supplementary Figure 1). Protein
expression of Akt was also reduced by treatment with 7.5 µM
penfluridol in GBM28, SJ-GBM2 and CHLA-200 cells
(Figure 3A–3B and Supplementary Figure 1). In addition,
we observed a notable inhibition of the markers of cancer
stem cells such as OCT4, Sox2 and Nanog. Furthermore,
significant cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP was observed
in a concentration-dependent manner in glioblastoma cells
after 48 h of penfluridol treatment, indicating apoptosis
(Figure 3A–3C and Supplementary Figure 1). Suppression
of OCT4 by penfluridol treatment was also confirmed by
immunofluorescence (Figure 4A). In addition, reduction in
the growth of glioblastoma neurosphere cells was observed
with 5 µM penfluridol treatment (Figure 4B).

RESULTS
Penfluridol suppresses the proliferation of
patient derived adult and pediatric glioblastoma
cell lines

GLI1 silencing enhances the effects of
penfluridol

To evaluate the growth suppressive effects of
penfluridol, we first performed the cytotoxicity assay in
a panel of ten cell lines consisting of five adult patient
derived (GBM43, GBM10, GBM44, GBM28, and
GBM14), two pediatric patient derived (SJ-GBM2 and
CHLA-200) as well as three established glioblastoma
cell lines (U87MG, U251MG and T98G). Our results
showed that with increasing concentrations, penfluridol
significantly suppressed the growth of all the ten
glioblastoma cell lines in a concentration and timedependent manner. The IC50 of penfluridol after 24 h
treatment ranged 4–10 µM in all the glioblastoma cell
lines tested (Figure 1A–1J). The IC50 was reduced to
about 2–5 µM after 48 and 72 h treatment (Figure 1A–1J).
These results suggest the potential cytotoxic effects of
penfluridol in glioblastoma cells.

To establish GLI1 as a target of penfluridol in
glioblastoma, GLI1 was inhibited by pharmacological
inhibitors or knocked down by GLI1 siRNA or CRISPR/
Cas9. Effect of penfluridol in suppressing GLI1 was
substantially enhanced in GBM28, SJ-GBM2 and U87MG
cells in which, GLI1 was either inhibited by specific
inhibitors or knocked down genetically (Figure 5A–5G)
and (Figure 6A). Significant cleavage of caspase 3 as well
as PARP was observed with penfluridol treatment in cells
pretreated with GANT 61, cyclopamine or with GLI1 knock
down using siRNA (Figure 5A–5G). Interestingly, enhanced
inhibition of stem cell markers like OCT4 and Nanog, was
also observed with penfluridol treatment in glioblastoma cells
pretreated with GANT61, cyclopamine or GLI1 knock down
using siRNA (Figure 5A–5G). Nonetheless, transfection of
GBM 28 cells with GLI1 CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in enhanced
cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP with penfluridol treatment
(Figure 6A). These results indicated GLI1 mediated growth
suppressive effect of penfluridol in glioblastoma cells.

Induction of apoptosis by penfluridol
To determine the mechanism of growth suppressive
effects of penfluridol, induction of apoptosis was evaluated
in glioblastoma cells by AnnexinV/FITC assay using flow
cytometer. As shown in Figure 2A–2F, 48 h treatment with
penfluridol resulted in significantly increased apoptosis
in glioblastoma cells. The percent of apoptosis ranged
30–75% after 48 h of treatment with 7.5 µM penfluridol
(Figure 2A–2F).

GLI1 regulates stem cell properties in
glioblastoma cells
Inhibition of GLI1 by established inhibitors like
GANT61 or cyclopamine or knocking down GLI1 using
siRNA or GLI1 CRISPR/Cas9 significantly reduced
the expression of OCT4 and Nanog indicating direct
regulation of cancer stem cells by GLI1 in glioblastoma
cells (Figure 5A–5G) and (Figure 6A). To further confirm
these observations, we determined the expression of OCT4
in wild type and GLI1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF). Our results demonstrated significantly low
expression of OCT4 in GLI1 (−/−) MEFs as compared to
GLI1 (+/+) MEFs (Figure 6B). These results indicate that
GLI1 regulates stem cells properties in glioblastoma cells.

Inhibition of Akt and sonic hedgehog signaling
by penfluridol
To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the growth
suppressive effects of penfluridol, we performed western
blot analysis using whole cell lysates from GBM28,
U87MG, SJ-GBM2 and CHLA-200 cells treated with 0,
1.25, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 µM penfluridol for 48 h. Our results
showed that penfluridol treatment significantly reduced the

Overexpression of GLI1 abrogates the growth
suppressive effects of penfluridol

processes including apoptosis and cell proliferation and
is also required for maintenance of glioblastoma growth.
Our results showed that penfluridol treatment inhibited
the activation of Akt by suppressing its phosphorylation
at Ser473 (Figure 3A–3C). To establish whether Akt
regulate GLI1, glioblastoma cells were treated with PI3K/
Akt inhibitors or Akt was knocked down using siRNA.
Interestingly, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt using
LY294002, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor or knocking down Akt
using Akt siRNA, resulted in reduced expression of
GLI1 (Figure 7A–7E). Enhanced cleavage of caspase 3
and PARP with penfluridol treatment was observed in
SJ-GBM2, GBM28 and U87MG cells where Akt was
inhibited (Figure 7A–7E). We also observed reduced
expression of Sox2 with penfluridol treatment in the cells
where Akt was silenced using AktsiRNA (Figure 7C–7E).

To further establish GLI1 as a target of penfluridol,
we overexpressed GLI1 using GLI1 overexpressing
plasmid. Reduced cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP
was observed with penfluridol treatment when GLI1
was overexpressed, indicating that penfluridol induces
apoptosis and suppresses the growth of GBM cells
through GLI1 inhibition, establishing GLI1 as a target of
penfluridol (Figure 6C–6D).

penfluridol for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cell survival was measured by sulforhodamine B assay to estimate IC50 values. The experiments were
repeated three times with 4–8 replicates in each experiment.

To further delineate the mechanism of GLI1 inhibition
through Akt by penfluridol treatment, effect of
penfluridol on Akt interaction with GLI1 was evaluated
by immunoprecipitation studies. GLI1 expression was
clearly visible in GBM28 cells immunoprecipitated with
pAkt (Ser473) indicating direct association or regulation
of GLI1 by Akt. Nonetheless, this association of Akt with
GLI1 was reduced significantly by penfluridol treatment
(Data not shown).

treated tumors was about 68% less than the tumors
from control group (Figure 8B). Tumors were analyzed
by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry.
In agreement with our in vitro findings, we observed
down regulation of GLI1 and increased cleavage of
caspase 3 in the tumors from penfluridol treated mice
as compared to tumors from control mice (Figure 8C).
In Figure 8C, each band represents lysate from separate
tumor coming from separate mouse. However, modest
decrease in pAkt(Ser 473) and OCT4 level was
observed in the tumors from penfluridol treated mice
as evaluated by immunohistochemistry (Figure 8D).
Our immunohistochemical results further demonstrated
significantly reduced expression of GLI1 and increased
cleavage of caspase 3 in tumors from penfluridol treated
mice (Figure 8D).
In a separate experiment, SJ-GBM2, pediatric
glioblastoma cells were implanted subcutaneously in
athymic nude mice. Mice were treated with 10 mg/kg
penfluridol by oral gavage everyday once each mouse
had palpable tumor. Penfluridol treatment suppressed
the growth of pediatric glioblastoma tumors by 35% as
compared to control group (Supplementary Figure 2A).
Surprisingly, effect of penfluridol in inhibiting the growth
of pediatric glioblastoma was less as compared to what
we observed with adult glioblastoma. This could be
attributed to the fact that H3F3A mutations are common
in pediatric glioblastoma, whereas IDH1 mutations are
common in adult glioblastoma tumors. Tumors collected

Penfluridol suppresses the growth of
glioblastoma in vivo
To test the efficacy of penfluridol in inhibiting
the growth of glioblastoma in vivo, U87MG adult
glioblastoma cells were implanted subcutaneously
in right and left flanks of athymic nude mice. Once
each mouse attained about 70mm3 tumor, mice were
randomly divided into two groups. Experimental group
of mice were treated with 10 mg/kg penfluridol by
oral gavage everyday whereas mice in control group
received vehicle only. Due to excessive tumor burden
in control group, mice were sacrificed at day 48. At the
day of sacrifice, average tumor volume of 3,143mm3 was
observed in control group as compared to 1,068mm3 in
penfluridol treated group, indicating 65% suppression
of glioblastoma tumor growth by penfluridol treatment
(Figure 8A). After terminating the experiment, tumors
were removed and weighed. Average weight of penfluridol

after sacrificing the mice were subjected to western blot
analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In agreement with
our in vitro observations in SJ-GBM2 cells, we observed
reduced pAkt(Ser473) and GLI1, and increased cleavage
of caspase 3 with penfluridol treatment (Supplementary
Figure 2B). These observations were further confirmed by
immunohistochemical analysis in control and penfluridol
treated tumors where similar observations were made
(Supplementary Figure 2C). These results indicated that

penfluridol suppresses glioblastoma tumor growth by Aktmediated inhibition of GLI1.
As a proof-of-principle and to further confirm
the efficacy of penfluridol in inhibiting the growth of
glioblastoma tumors in brain, U87MG-luc cells were
injected intracranially into the brain of mice using
steriotaxic apparatus. Mice were treated with 10 mg/kg
penfluridol by oral gavage every day after 14 days of
tumor cell implantation in the brain. Weight of mice was

taken once a week. No significant change in the average
weight of mice in control and penfluridol treated group
was observed (Supplementary Figure 3). Our results
showed that penfluridol treatment suppressed the growth
of intracranially implanted glioblastoma tumors in brain
by 72% (Figure 9A). We also analyzed luminescence in
the isolated brains from both the groups after euthanizing
the mice. Average brain luminescence from penfluridol
treated group was 94% less as compared to control group
(Figure 9B). The isolated brains with tumors were lysed
for western blot analysis. In agreement with in vitro
observations, penfluridol treatment reduced pAkt(Ser473),
GLI1 and OCT4, and enhanced cleavage of caspase 3
in brain tumors (Figure 9C). As evaluated by TUNEL,
significant apoptosis was observed in the brain with

glioblastoma tumors by penfluridol treatment (Figure 9D).
H & E staining of brain tumors clearly showed smaller
tumor size in the treatment group as compared to control
(Figure 9D).
To study the long term effect of penfluridol
administration, locomotor activity was evaluated using
Versamax chamber in mice implanted with tumors in the
brain and treated with 10 mg/kg penfluridol everyday
by oral gavage for 54 days. No significant difference in
the locomotor activities of mice such as total distance,
horizontal activity, ambulatory activity, rest time,
locomotor clockwise revolution and locomotor counter
clockwise revolution were observed between control and
penfluridol treated group (Supplementary Figure 4A–4F).
These results indicated that chronic administration of

induce any significant behavioral change in mice activities.
However, further in-depth detailed studies are required.

glioblastoma cell lines including patient-derived adult
and pediatric cell lines. We observed that penfluridol
treatment significantly reduced the viability of all the
glioblastoma cells in a concentration and time-dependent
manner with IC50 ranging between 3–5 µM after 48 h of
treatment. Significant apoptosis was observed in all the
cell lines treated with penfluridol. Several recent studies
demonstrated the role of sonic hedgehog signaling,
specifically GLI1 in glioblastoma progression and the
role of GLI1 in imparting stem cells characteristics [2].
Interestingly, GLI1 was found to be up-regulated in
glioblastoma and responsible for chemo-resistance
[9, 10]. We observed that penfluridol treatment reduced
the expression of GLI1 in all the glioblastoma cells in
a concentration-dependent manner. Recently, it was
shown that Akt signaling is required for maintenance of
glioblastoma tumors [11] and non-canonical activation

DISCUSSION
Our current study demonstrated potential anticancer effects of penfluridol in vitro and in vivo against
glioblastoma, which is known to be an incurable type
of brain tumor. Penfluridol is an FDA-approved antipsychotic drug specifically prescribed for schizophrenia.
Thioridazine, another antipychotic drug was recently shown
to inhibit the growth of glioblastoma by inducing autophagy
[6]. However, thioridazine was associated with significant
cardiac toxicity, thus preventing its use in the clinic [7].
In the current study, we evaluated the anticancer effects of penfluridol in a panel of ten different

of GLI1 was observed by PI3K/Akt signaling in renal
cell carcinoma [4]. However, it was not known whether
GLI1 activation was mediated by Akt in glioblastoma.
Our current studies established regulation of GLI1 by
Akt in glioblastoma cells. Our results also demonstrated
that penfluridol treatment suppressed the activation
(phosphorylation) of Akt in a concentration-dependent
manner in all the glioblastoma cell lines tested.
It has been reported that glioblastoma tumors
develop resistance to temozolomide therapy due to

overexpression of GLI1, and that GLI1 imparts stem cell
like properties to cancer cells rendering them ineffective
to chemotherapy [1]. Furthermore, initiation and
maintenance of cancerous phenotype requires intricate
and synergistic interaction with several oncogenic
signaling [12]. In our current study, we demonstrated that
penfluridol treatment inhibited the growth of glioblastoma
cells by Akt-mediated inhibition of GLI1. OCT4, Sox2
and Nanog are basic transcriptional factors that are
expressed in cancer stem cells as well as in embryonic

Figure 5: GLI1 mediated suppression of glioblastoma cell growth by penfluridol treatment. GBM28 and SJ-GBM2 cells

were treated with penfluridol (5 μM) for 48 h after (A–B) cells were pretreated with 30 µM GANT61 for 3 h (C–D) cells were pretreated
with 25 µM Cyclopamine for 3 h (E–G) GBM28, SJ-GBM2 and U87MG cells were transfected with GLI1 siRNA. Actin was used as a
loading control. Figures shown are the representatives blots of three independent experiments.

stem cells [13]. Upregulation of OCT4, Sox2 and Nanog
has been reported in many cancers such as prostate and
breast cancer [14] [15]. Also, these transcription factors
are overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors than
in tumors that are well differentiated [14]. Our results
showed down regulation of cancer stem cell markers
such as OCT4, Nanog and Sox2 by penfluridol treatment.
Inhibiting GLI1 with commercially available inhibitors
like GANT61 and cyclopamine or knocking down
using GLI1siRNA and GLI1 specific CRISPR/Cas9,
significantly enhanced the growth suppressive effects of
penfluridol. Of note, our studies indicated that knocking
down GLI1 reduced the expression of OCT4 and Nanog
showing direct regulation of cancer stem cells by GLI1
in glioblastoma cells. On the other hand, overexpression
of GLI1 using GLI1 specific plasmid, reduced the

growth inhibitory effects of penfluridol, indicating the
specificity of penfluridol for GLI1 in glioblastoma cells.
Interestingly, inhibiting Akt using LY294002 or knocking
down Akt using Akt specific siRNA resulted in not only
down regulation of GLI1 but also enhanced the growth
suppressive effects of penfluridol in our model, indicating
the regulation of GLI1 by Akt.
Recently, we published that penfluridol significantly
suppresses the metastatic tumor growth of breast cancer in
brain by inhibiting integrinα6β4 signaling, supporting our
rationale for current studies [8]. Repression of integrins
with penfluridol treatment in breast cancer was also shown
through reactive oxygen species and Sp transcription
factors in a very recent study [16]. It has been reported
by several published studies that GLI1 regulates integrins
in different cancer models [17, 18]. Anti-cancer activity

in vivo results showed 65% growth suppression of U87MG
xenografts in athymic nude mice. As a proof of principle,
in intracranial tumor model, we observed 72% growth
inhibition of tumors in the brain by penfluridol treatment.
Although, penfluridol, an antipsychotic drug has blood
brain barrier penetrability, interestingly we observed almost
similar efficacy of penfluridol in subcutaneous as well as
intracranial model of glioblastoma. Future investigations
with regard to the availability of penfluridol in peripheral
tissues versus brain are thus required. Interestingly, similar
dose of penfluridol was less effective in inhibiting the
growth of SJ-GBM2, pediatric glioblastoma tumors in
xenograft model. Low efficacy of penfluridol against
pediatric tumor may in part be attributed to the fact that
one third of pediatric glioblastoma is characterized by

of penfluridol was also observed by Chien et al. in
pancreatic cancer cells with IC50 ranging from 9–37 µM
[19] while our current studies showed much lower IC50
in glioblastoma cells ranging 3–5 µM only. Interestingly,
Wu et al. demonstrated anti-tumor activity of penfluridol
through dysregulation of cholesterol whereas our previous
studies showed autophagy mediated cell death by
penfluridol in pancreatic cancer [20, 21].
We demonstrated previously that 10 mg/kg/day
dose of penfluridol by oral gavage significantly inhibited
the growth of metastatic breast tumors in the brain and
orthotopically implanted tumors in the pancreas [8, 20].
In the current study, similar dose of penfluridol by oral
gavage significantly suppressed the growth of glioblastoma
tumors in three different glioblastoma tumor models. Our

H3F3A mutations, whereas IDH1-mutated glioblastoma
is common in adult patients [22]. H3F3A mutation in
pediatric glioblastoma drives the upregulation of oncogenes
[23]. Our results on the efficacy of penfluridol in adult
GBM cells with IDH1 mutations are supported by findings
from other laboratories, which shows that IDH1 mutation
is associated with prolonged overall survival and better
efficacy of temozolomide [24]. On the other hand, H3F3A
mutation is associated with poor prognosis in children

[25] and long term survivors are associated with wild
type H3F3A [25]. Critical molecular differences between
adult and pediatric glioblastoma does not guarantee similar
efficacy of a given drug in both the cases [26]. Nonetheless,
further in-depth studies are required to establish the
reason behind differential efficacy of penfluridol in adult
and pediatric glioblastoma. Consistent with our in vitro
observations, we observed reduced phosphorylation of
Akt at Ser473 and expression of GLI1 and OCT4, as well

as cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP, in the tumors from
penfluridol treated mice as compared to control mice, as
evaluated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry.
Penfluridol induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL
staining. No general toxicity or behavioral side effect was
observed in the brain tumor bearing mice treated with 10
mg/kg/day penfluridol as compared to control mice.

Overall, our studies established the anti-tumor
efficacy of penfluridol against glioblastoma via Aktmediated suppression of GLI1. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report showing suppression
of glioblastoma tumor growth by penfluridol treatment,
setting the foundation for developing penfluridol as a
treatment option for glioblastoma patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

day, cells were treated with different concentrations of
penfluridol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After desired
duration of treatment with penfluridol (24, 48 and 72 h),
cells were fixed using ice cold 10% trichloroacetic
acid followed by washing with water and staining with
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye. Plates were washed with 1%
solution of acetic acid and the optical density was measured
in 10 mM Tris-base solution, using plate reader (BioTek
Instruments, VT) as described by us previously [30].

Ethics statement
All the animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with the ethical standards and according to approved protocol
by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC),
Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.

Cell culture

AnnexinV/FITC apoptosis assay

Patients-derived glioblastoma cells GBM43,
GBM10, GBM44, GBM28, GBM14 as well as U251MG
used in this study were kindly provided by Dr. Jann N.
Sarkaria, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. GBM28
and GBM43 have mutated p53 whereas p16 is deleted in
GBM10, GBM14, GBM43 and GBM44 [27]. Patientsderived glioblastoma cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSN whereas
U251MG cells were maintained in EMEM media
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSN. U87MG and
T98G cells were purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA,
and maintained in EMEM supplemented with 10%FBS and
1% PSN. We started working with U87MG cell line 2–3
years ago when there was no question regarding its origin.
Unfortunately, recently, origin of U87MG was found to be
different than from the reported GBM tumor. However, it
is still established that the origin of U87MG is from tumors
present in the brain. Pediatric patients-derived glioblastoma
cells, SJ-GBM2 and CHLA-200 used in this study were
kind gift from Dr. Patrick Reynold, Children Oncology
Group (COG), Texas Tech University Health Sciences
Center. SJ-GBM2 cells were derived from a five year old
female patient who relapsed after chemotherapy, whereas
CHLA-200 was derived from a twelve year old male patient
after post-mortem who relapsed after chemotherapy. Cells
were maintained in IMDM media supplemented with 20%
Fetal Bovine Serum, 4 mM L-Glutamine, 1X ITS (5 µg/mL
insulin, 5 µg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL selenous acid).
Mouse embryonic fibroblast MEF GLI1+/+ and MEF
GLI1−/− were provided by Dr. Jann N. Sarkaria, Mayo
Clinics, Rochester. MEFs were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10%FBS and 1%PSN as described
by us previously [28]. Neurosphere forming cells, which
form neurosphere were kind gift from Dr. Jann N. Sarkaria.
For neurosphere formation, cells were plated on laminin
coated plate and maintained in serum free media consisting
of Knockout DMEM/F12 media supplemented with
2% serum free media supplement, 2% L-glutamine, 1%
penicillin/streptomycin, 20 ng/ml EFG and 20 ng/ml FGF,
as described previously [29].

AnnexinV/FITC apoptosis assay was performed
using a commercially available kit and according to
manufacturer’s instruction (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA). Approximately 0.2–0.3 × 106 GBM cells
were plated in each well of 6 well plate and left overnight
in the incubator. Penfluridol was added at required
concentrations. After 48 h of treatment, cells were
trypsinized and suspended in PBS. Cells were washed
in PBS and suspended in 150 µl of binding buffer. 4 µl
Annexin-V FITC and 4 µl propidium iodide was added
followed by incubation for 20 minutes in dark. Volume
was adjusted to 300 µL by adding binding buffer. Samples
were analyzed by flow cytometer after mixing the cells
gently (Accuri C6, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and as described
by us previously [20].

Western blot analysis
The whole cell lysates were prepared using 4%
(w/v) CHAPS in urea-tris buffer. 20–60 µg of protein
obtained after lysing the cells were subjected to SDSPAGE and the resolved proteins were transferred to
PVDF membrane. The membranes were probed for
primary antibodies against pAkt(Ser473), GLI1, OCT4,
Nanog, Sox2, Cl PARP, Cl caspase 3 and Actin. All
primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technologies (Danvers, MA) except pAkt(Ser473) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX) and Actin (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Dilution factor was 1:1000 for
all the antibodies from Cell Signaling and 1:2000 for Actin
antibody. The membranes were developed as described by
us previously [8, 31, 32].

Sonic hedgehog inhibitors treatment
GBM28, SJ-GBM2 and U87MG glioblastoma
cells were plated at a density of 0.2–0.3 × 106 cells per
well in a six-well plate. After overnight incubation,
cells were pretreated for 3h with 25 µM cyclopamine
or 30 µM GANT 61. Cyclopamine and GANT 61 were
purchased from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI. After
pretreatment with inhibitors, cells were treated with 5 µM
penfluridol for 48 h and processed for western blotting as
explained above.

Neurosphere assay

Akt inhibitor treatment

Neurosophere of GBM12TMZ-3080RZ cells
were maintained in knockout DMEM/F-12 media
supplemented with SFM supplement, L-glutamine,
penicillin-streptomycin, FGF and EGF. Neurosphere
forming cells were plated on laminin coated culture plate.
Neurospheres were collected from culture plate along with
media. Neurosphere pellet was formed by centrifugation,
re-suspended in Trypsin and placed in the incubator for
three minutes. Pellet was pipetted to further break the
neurospheres. Cells were counted and about 0.1 × 106 cells
per well were plated in an uncoated 6 well plate. After
incubation, cells from neurosphere were treated with 5 µM
penfluridol for another 48 h. Images were taken using light
microscope (Leica).

GBM28 and SJ-GBM2 cells were plated in a six
well plate at a density of 0.2–0.3 × 106 cells per well. Cells
were left for overnight incubation. After incubation, cells
were pretreated for 3 h with LY294002, known PI3K/
Akt inhibitors. LY294002 was purchased from Cayman
Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). After pretreatment with
inhibitors, cells were treated with 5 µM penfluridol for
48 h and processed for western blotting as explained above

Silencing of Akt
GBM 28, SJ-GBM2 and U87MG cells were
transfected with Akt siRNA (Cell Signaling Technologies,
Danvers, MA). Transfection was performed using siPORT
(Ambion Inc, Austin, TX) transfection reagent and as
per manufacturers protocol. Cells were transfected with

U87MG xenograft implantation
Athymic nude mice (4–6 week old) were purchased
from Harlan Laboratory (Livermore, CA). The use and
treatment of athymic nude mice was approved from
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC),
Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo,
Texas. All the experiments were performed under the strict
compliance and regulations. 1 × 106 U87 MG cells in 1:1
mixture of PBS and matrigel were implanted in right and
left flanks of mice. Once tumor volume reached around
70–100 mm3, mice were randomly divided into two groups
with five mice in each group. Group I served as control
and received the vehicle only. Group II received 10 mg/kg
penfluridol by oral gavage every day. Penfluridol stock
was made in DMSO, which was further diluted in water/

Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation was performed as described by
us previously [34, 35]. Briefly, 0.7 × 106 GBM 28 cells
were plated in 100mm tissue culture dishes and treated

PEG300/ethanol/2% acetic acid in 8:3:0.13:1 v/v [8].
Tumor volume was measured twice a week till day 48 by
using vernier caliper as described by us before [36]. At
day 48, mice were humanely sacrificed and tumors were
removed. Weights of all the tumors were taken. A part of
tumor was snap frozen for western blotting and other part
was fixed in formalin for immunohistochemistry.

tumor tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin.
Tissues were sectioned into 5 µM thick sections using
microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL).
The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated by
performing three washes of xylene for 10 minutes each,
two washes of 100% ethanol for 5 minutes each followed
by two washes of 95% ethanol for 6 minutes and one wash
each of 70% and 50% ethanol for 3 minutes. At last the
sections were given two 5 minute washes in distilled water
(dH2O). Unmasking of antigen was done by boiling the
sections in 10mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Sections
were washed and incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide
solution. The sections were blocked with 6% goat serum
in 1% BSA for half hours and incubated with primary
antibodies for cleaved caspase 3 (1:300), pAkt(Ser473)
(1:300), GLI1 (1:300) and OCT4 (1:300) overnight at 4°C.
Next day the slides were stained using Ultravision ONE
HRP polymer kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Thermofisher scientific, Fremont, CA). Counterstaining
of sections was performed with Mayer’s hematoxylin and
dehydrated. The slides were mounted using Permount
(Fisher scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) and imaged using
Olympus microscope (Olympus America Inc, Center
Valley, PA) at 20× magnification. Antibody for cleaved
caspase 3 and OCT4 were purchased from Cell Signaling
whereas antibody for GLI1 and pAkt(Ser473) used for
immunohistochemistry were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX. TUNEL assay was carried
out according to manufacturer’s protocol (TUNEL assay
kit was purchased from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA)

Patient-derived SJ-GBM2 xenograft tumors
Female athymic nude mice (4–6 week old) were
purchased from Harlan Laboratory (Livermore, CA).
All the experiments were performed under the strict
compliance and regulations as mentioned before. 1 × 106
SJ-GBM2 cells in 1:1 mixture of PBS and matrigel were
implanted in flanks of mice. Once tumor volume was
around 50–70 mm3, mice were randomly segregated
into two groups with five mice in each group. Test group
of mice received 10 mg/kg penfluridol by oral gavage
every day till day 39, whereas control mice received
vehicle alone. Experiment was terminated at day 39 by
euthanizing mice with CO2 overdose. The tumors were
removed from each mouse, weight was taken and a part of
tumor was snap frozen in liquid-nitrogen for western blot
analysis. Another part of tumor was fixed in formalin for
immunohistochemical analysis.

Intracranial tumor model of U87MG tumors
Female athymic nude mice (4–6 weeks old) from
Harlan Laboratories (Livermore, CA) were used for
intracranial injection and the experiments were conducted
in strict compliance with the regulations of Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Texas Tech
University Health Sciences Center. U87MG-luc cells
were harvested, washed twice with sterile PBS and resuspended in PBS at a density of 30 × 106 cells per ml.
A suspension of 5 µl containing 0.15 × 106 cells was
injected by intracranial route using stereotaxic apparatus.
Following this, mice were randomly divided into two
groups with eleven mice in each group. Penfluridol at the
dose of 10 mg/kg was administered to mice by oral gavage
after 14 days of tumor cells implantation in the brain and
every day after that. The tumor growth was monitored by
non-invasive in vivo live animal imaging (IVIS Caliper) as
described before [37]. Experiment was terminated at day
54 by humanely euthanizing the mice with CO2 overdose
and mice brain were carefully dissected out, imaged for
luminescence. Few brains from control and penfluridol
treated group mice were snap frozen for western blot
analysis whereas other brains were fixed in formalin for
immunohistochemical and TUNEL analysis.

Mice behavioral analysis
In intracranial experiment, mice from control and
treated group were analyzed for any behavioral side
effect due to penfluridol. Mice were observed for general
signs of toxicity. After 54 days of treatment, behavioral
activity of mice was assessed using Versamax (AccuScan
Instruments Inc., Columbus, OH, USA) and as described
by us before [8]. Versamax is a ventilated chamber
equipped with infrared sensors along the side wall to
monitor mice activity.

Statistical analysis
Prism 6.0 software was used for all the statistical
analysis (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego, CA). Results
are represented as means ± standard deviation (SD) or
standard error of means (SEM). Statistical significance
was analyzed using Student’s t-test and outcomes were
considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.
