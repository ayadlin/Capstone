BACKGROUND: Although greater than 40% of breast cancers occur in patients aged 65 years, these individuals are frequently
undertreated. Taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy is considered the treatment of choice but to the authors’ knowledge has only
limited evidence in elderly patients. METHODS: Patients aged 65 years with a Charlson comorbidity index 2 and pT1/2 pN0/1
disease and either human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, hormone receptor-negative, grade 3 (according to
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]), high uPA/PAI-1 or any stage pT3/4 pN2/3 breast cancer were
randomized to receive 4 cycles of adjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) (epirubicin at a dose of 90 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 600 mg/m2 intravenously [iv] on day 1 every 3 22 days) or 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
5-fluorouracil (CMF) (cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg/m2, methotrexate at a dose of 40 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil at a dose
of 600 mg/m2 iv on days 1 plus 8 every 29 days) versus 6 cycles of nab-paclitaxel and capecitabine (nPX) (nab-paclitaxel at a dose
of 100 mg/m2 iv on days 1, 8, and 15 every 21 days with 1 week of rest every 6 weeks plus capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg/m2
orally on days 1-14 every 21 days). Primary endpoints were treatment discontinuations and overall frequency of adverse events.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 198 patients (6.6%) discontinued EC/CMF and 69 of 193 patients (35.8%) discontinued nPX (P<.001) with 1 and
5 deaths observed during treatment, respectively. Grade 3 to 5 adverse events were more frequent among patients treated with EC/
CMF (90.9%) than among those treated with nPX (64.8%) (P<.001), with hematological toxicities being more frequent with EC/CMF
(88.4% vs 22.3%; P<.001), but nonhematological toxicities (hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, mucositis, fatigue, sensory neuropathy,
thromboembolisms, and metabolic disorders) being more frequent with nPX (58.5% vs 18.7%; P<.001). None of the geriatric scores
(Charlson comorbidity index, Vulnerable Elders Survey [VES-13], Instrumental Activities of Daily Living [IADL], and G8) independently
predicted grade 3 to 5 toxic events or treatment discontinuations. No differences in survival between the treatment groups were
observed after 22.8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with EC/CMF, treatment with nPX led to more treatment discontinuations

Original Article

Today, patients who are at an increased risk of disease recurrence will receive polychemotherapy, usually including
a taxane because taxane-based regimens have demonstrated higher activity compared with non-taxanecontaining therapies.2 Treatment effect appears to be little
affected by age.2 Nevertheless, a multitude of studies have
shown that older women are undertreated and this undertreatment has been linked to higher rates of breast cancer
recurrence and mortality.3,4
Efficacy results from younger patients cannot be extrapolated directly to elderly patients because these individuals might have less tolerance for treatment and
therefore treatment benefits might be smaller. We previously conducted a meta-analysis of 4 (neo)adjuvant
taxane-based trials conducted in all age groups and
demonstrated that weekly paclitaxel appeared especially
feasible in patients aged >60 years.5
To the best of our knowledge, trials restricted specifically to the elderly population are limited. Only one
phase 3 trial addressing the role of adjuvant chemotherapy
specifically in the elderly has been reported to date and
has demonstrated a significantly better disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for the combination
of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) compared
with capecitabine monotherapy.6
Two agents were reported to have a favorable toxicity profile specifically in elderly patients. Nabpaclitaxel, an albumin-bound 130-nanometer particle
form of paclitaxel, was developed to avoid toxicities
associated with the Cremophor vehicle in solvent-based
paclitaxel. A subgroup analysis of patients aged >65
years demonstrated good tolerability of the weekly
nab-paclitaxel regimen.7 Capecitabine at a dose of 2000
mg/m2 demonstrated high efficacy in patients aged 65
years with metastatic breast cancer.8 Patients who received
a dose reduction from 2500 mg/m2 to 2000 mg/m2
because of toxicity did not demonstrate inferior
efficacy in retrospective subgroup analyses.9 Both drugs
have been used in combination with a favorable
toxicity profile.10
Therefore, we conducted the Investigational
Chemotherapy for Elderly patients II (ICE II) trial
to evaluate the compliance with and toxicity of a combination of nab-paclitaxel and capecitabine (nPX) in comparison with the combination of epirubicin and
cyclophosphamide (EC) or CMF in an elderly population (Fig. 1). The study was planned as a sequential
phase 2/3 study with the decision to continue with the
phase 3 part based on the safety results of 100 patients
3640

completely treated in each arm. Because the phase 3
study was not initiated due to slow accrual and limited
financial support, we herein report the results of the
phase 2 portion of the study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Objectives

The primary objective of this phase 2 study was to determine the compliance and toxicity of EC/CMF and nPX.
Secondary objectives were to compare the predictive value
of different geriatric assessment tools for predicting the
compliance with and safety of the study treatment, and to
compare the invasive DFS (iDFS) and OS.
Patients

Female or male patients aged 65 years with a Charlson
comorbidity index11 2 and completely resected unilateral or bilateral, nonmetastatic primary invasive breast
cancer were eligible for trial participation if they had provided written informed consent. Patients were required to
have pT1/2 pN0/1 disease and either human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, hormone
receptor-negative, grade 3, high urokinase plasminogen
activator (uPA) or high plasminogen activator inhibitor 1
(PAI-1) breast cancer or any pT3/4 pN2/3 breast cancer
irrespective of additional risk factors with a time since axillary surgery of 3 months. Patients were not allowed to
have a previous diagnosis of invasive or locally advanced,
nonoperable breast cancer or another incurable primary
malignancy with an event-free survival of <5 years. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status had to be 2 and patients had to have a life expectancy estimate of 5 years. Exclusion criteria included preexisting motor or sensory neuropathy of a severity grade
2; a history of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders; known or suspected significant cardiac diseases;
known hypersensitivity reaction to the compounds or
incorporated substances; known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency; and leukocytes <3.5 g/L, platelets <100 g/L, creatinine or bilirubin >1.25 times the
upper normal limits, and creatinine clearance <50 mL/
minute. Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy and concurrent or previous specific systemic investigational or
established antitumor treatment were not permitted.
Treatment

Patients were allocated to receive as standard treatment either 4 cycles of EC (epirubicin at a dose of 90 mg/m2 and
cyclophosphamide at dose of 600 mg/m2 intravenously
[iv] on day 1 every 3 weeks) or 6 cycles of CMF

(cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg/m2, methotrexate
at a dose of 40 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil at a dose of 600
mg/m2 iv on days 1 plus 8 every 4 weeks) based on the
investigators’ decision or, as experimental treatment, 6
cycles of nPX (nab-paclitaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m2 iv
over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 every 3 weeks with a
week of rest every 6 weeks plus capecitabine at a dose of
1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14 every 3
weeks) (Fig. 1).
Nab-paclitaxel could not be distributed for 9
months during the conduct of the trial, and therefore
patients allocated to nab-paclitaxel during this phase
received paclitaxel instead (12 patients for all cycles and
18 patients for some cycles).
5-HT3 inhibitors, aprepitant, metoclopramide, or
alizapride in combination with corticosteroids were recommended as supportive treatment for EC/CMF; however, no corticosteroids and antihistamines were
recommended for nPX. No primary prophylaxis with
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was recommended.
Sequential radiotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy, and
endocrine treatment were recommended according to
national guidelines.
Study Procedures

Physical examination, ECOG performance status, differential blood counts (weekly), and biochemical measures
including fasting glucose and insulin levels were assessed at
the time of study entry and at every cycle. Mammography,
Cancer

October 15, 2015

breast ultrasound, chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound, bone
scans, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography were performed at the time of study entry and repeated during
chemotherapy when clinically indicated. Four geriatric
assessments scores (Charlson comorbidity index, Vulnerable Elders Survey [VES-13], Instrumental Activities of
Daily Living [IADL], and G8) were assessed at the time of
study entry and at end of chemotherapy (See Supporting
Information Fig. 1).
All patients were followed by physical examination
and breast imaging techniques every 3 months during the
first 2 years and every 6 months for years 2 through 5 for
the diagnosis of local, locoregional, ipsilateral, or contralateral recurrences; distant metastasis; or death.
Statistical Analysis

The ICE II trial is a prospective, multicenter, controlled,
open-label, randomized phase 2/3 study. Randomization
at a 1:1 ratio was performed centrally and stratified
according to participating center, risk assessment method
(pT3/4, pN2/3, or clinicopathological or uPA/PAI-1),
age (aged 65-69 years, 70-80 years, and >80 years at diagnosis), and estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor
(PgR)/HER2 status (ER negative [-]/PgR-/HER2- vs
HER2 positive [1] vs ER1 and/or PgR1/HER2-).
The study was planned as a sequential phase 2/3
study with the decision to continue with the phase 3 part
made after the accrual of 400 patients and based on the
results of an interim safety analysis of 100 patients

completely treated in each arm. We planned 1458
patients for the phase 3 part, seeking an improvement in
the 5-year DFS rate from 75% with EC/CMF to 82%
with nPX, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.74. However, after full accrual of 400 patients into the phase 2 portion, the trial did not continue to phase 3 due to slow
recruitment and a lack of financial support despite approval for continuation by the independent data monitoring committee based on the results of the interim safety
analysis.
All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis in all randomized and treated patients. Compliance
and toxicity were analyzed according to the treatment
received and survival according to the allocated treatment.
The primary endpoints were any premature treatment discontinuation of EC/CMF or nPX as well as any Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0)
grade 3 to 5 adverse event. Secondary endpoints were any
modification of treatment schedule (chemotherapy dose
reduction, dose delay, interruption of capecitabine for >3
days) and the results of the geriatric scores. Secondary efficacy endpoints were any local invasive or distant recurrence of breast cancer, any contralateral breast cancer, any
second malignancy, and any death irrespective of its cause
for iDFS and any death for OS.
Treatment groups were compared using the 2-sided
Pearson chi-square test (for parameters with 3 catego3642

ries), Fisher exact test (for binary parameters), and
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for continuous parameters. Geriatric scores, body mass index, ECOG performance status, number of comedications, hemoglobin and
albumin levels, stage of breast cancer, age at study entry,
and treatment arm were parameters in univariable and
multivariable models to predict treatment discontinuations and grade 3 to 5 adverse events. Time-to-event outcome parameters were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
product-limit method and treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test. P values are reported explicitly without any adjustment for multiple comparisons.
The protocol was reviewed by all responsible local
ethics committees. The conduct of the trial was supervised
by an independent data monitoring committee. The trial
registration number for Clinicaltrials.gov is NCT01204437.

RESULTS
From April 2009 to April 2013, 400 of 423 screened
patients were randomized to the ICE II trial in 63 centers
of the German Breast Group (Fig. 2). A total of 391
patients initiated treatment: 182 with EC, 16 with CMF,
and 193 with nPX. Nine patients (4 in the EC/CMF arm
and 5 in the nPX arm) did not initiate treatment and
therefore were not included in the intent-to-treat population. The as-treated safety population was identical to the
Cancer

October 15, 2015

EC/CMF or nPX in Elderly Patients With Breast Ca/von Minckwitz et al

intent-to-treat population because no crossover occurred
between arms.
Baseline characteristics of the 391 study participants
with a median age of 72 years (range, 65-84 years) were
balanced between treatment arms (Table 1). Approximately two-thirds of the patients fulfilled the eligibility of
having clinicopathologically medium to high-risk pT1/2
pN0/1 breast cancer. Geriatric assessment tools identified
moderately fit patients in 3.3% (Charlson comorbidity
index 2), 13.3% (VES-13 score 2), 5.4% (IADL score
7), and 16.7% (G8 score 14) of patients. The distribution of breast cancer subtypes was comparable to that
expected in younger patients (65.5% with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative disease, 16.9% with
HER2-positive disease, and 17.6% with triple-negative
breast cancers). Mastectomy was performed in 32.5% of
patients.
Overall, 13 patients (6.6%) in the EC/CMF arm
versus 69 patients (35.8%) in the nPX arm discontinued
treatment early (P<.001) (Fig. 2). The main reasons for
discontinuation in both arms were adverse events. Deaths
during treatment occurred in 1 patient due to pulmonary
embolism in the EC/CMF arm and in 5 patients in the
nPX arm (2 because of thromboembolism, 1 because of a
cardiac event, 1 due to febrile neutropenia, and 1 due to
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase insufficiency) (36.8%).
EC/CMF was delayed for medical reasons in 22
patients (11.1%) and nPX was delayed in 71 patients
(36.8%) (P<.001). Dose reductions were necessary in 9
patients (4.5%) and 112 patients (58.0%), respectively,
treated with EC/CMF or nPX (P<.001). Patients treated
with EC/CMF and those treated with nPX demonstrated
a median relative dose intensity of 97.5% and 85.4%,
respectively (P .001).
Grade 3 to 5 adverse events were more frequent with
EC/CMF (90.9%) than with nPX (64.8%) (P<.001),
with hematological toxicities being more frequent with
EC/CMF (88.4% vs 22.3%; P<.001) but nonhematological toxicities (hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, sensory neuropathy, and infections) being more frequent with nPX
(18.7% vs 58.5%; P<.001) (Table 2).
Geriatric assessments changed from before to after
chemotherapy in both treatment arms (Charlson comorbidity index decreased in 7.3% and increased in 13.6%;
VES-13 score decreased in 38.4% and increased in 8.8%;
IADL decreased in 2.0% and increased in 20.9%; and the
G8 score decreased in 42.9% and increased in 5.2% of
patients). Treatment arm, ECOG performance status, hemoglobin level, and VES-13 and G8 scores were found to
be predictive of treatment discontinuations; however,
Cancer

October 15, 2015

only the treatment arm provided independent information in the multivariate model. Treatment arm, ECOG
performance status before the initiation of therapy, and
number of comedications were found to predict grade 3
to 5 toxic events, although only treatment arm and
ECOG performance status were independent factors
(Table 3).
After a median follow-up of 22.8 months, 39 iDFS
events (21 in the EC/CMF arm and 18 in the nPX arm)
and 23 OS events (11 in the EC/CMF arm and 12 in the
nPX arm) were recorded. Hazard ratios were 0.91 for
iDFS and 1.18 for OS with broad 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) (95% CI, 0.49-1.71 [log-rank P 5.776]
for iDFS and 95% CI, 0.52 to 2.66 [log-rank P 5.699]
for OS) (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the ICE II trial is the first
study to investigate a taxane-based polychemotherapy regimen specifically designed for a moderately fit elderly population. The comparator arm was chosen based on the
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) phase 3 study
49907 demonstrating that doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide or (oral) CMF were more effective than capecitabine
monotherapy in patients aged 65 years. Anthracyclinetaxane combinations or sequential regimens can be used in
very fit elderly patients5; however, in many cases the use of
anthracyclines is avoided due to their cardiac toxicity.
Therefore, we built on the inferior monotherapy arm of the
current study and added a taxane. Nab-paclitaxel can be
given without corticosteroids, which is considered advantageous especially among patients at risk of developing or
experiencing deterioration in diabetes. Nevertheless, a significantly higher rate of treatment discontinuations was
reported for the patients treated with the nPX regimen compared with EC/CMF. Reasons were mainly adverse events
followed by investigator decision or patient wish. Grade 3
to 5 adverse events were generally more frequent with EC/
CMF (90.9%) than with nPX (64.8%) (P<.001), with
hematological toxicities being more frequent among
patients treated with EC/CMF (88.4% vs 22.3%; P<.001),
but nonhematological toxicities (hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, sensory neuropathy, and infections) (18.7% vs 58.5%;
P<.001) and deaths (1 vs 5) being more frequent with nPX.
Because the trial stopped after the completion of the phase 2
part and the phase 3 portion was not initiated, the statistical
power of the survival analysis is limited so that the risks cannot be related to the benefits of both treatments. The VES13 and G8 scores were able to predict such treatment discontinuations; however, in a multivariate model, treatment

Figure 3. (Left) Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and (Right) overall survival (OS) of participants in the ICE II (Investigational
Chemotherapy for Elderly patients II) trial by treatment arm. 95% CI indicates 95% confidence interval; CMF indicates

arm was found to be the only independent predictor for this
endpoint. None of the scores was able to predict grade 3 to
5 toxic events, whereas this was independently predicted
only by treatment arm and ECOG performance status.
To the best of our knowledge, only a few smaller studies to date have reported prospective geriatric assessment to
predict tolerability of chemotherapy. The association
between 6 geriatric indicators of frailty and toxicity was
reported for first-line chemotherapy in 78 elderly patients
with metastatic breast cancer.12,13 The frequency of grade 3
to 4 toxicities increased from 19% in patients without a
geriatric indicator to 56% in patients with 2 geriatric indicators and 80% in those with 3 geriatric indicators
(P 5.002). Polypharmacy was the only individual factor
found to be significantly associated with toxicity
(P 5.001). Another study reported the predictive value of
geriatric assessment scores in 123 elderly patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer.14 The Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and IADL score were found to be
predictive of severe toxicity or unexpected hospitalization
(Mini-Mental State Examination), suggesting that not only
physical functioning but also cognitive function should
be taken into account when choosing a regimen for
chemotherapy.
Limitations of the ICE II trial are that it was stopped
after phase 2 part and did not proceed to phase 3 to
adequately assess survival in both treatment arms. The
main reason for the slow accrual was that patients considered fit enough to be treated on the nPX arm also were

considered fit enough to join other chemotherapy studies
or treatments outside of clinical trials for patients without
age limits. Conversely, many elderly patients were considered by local investigators not to be fit enough for any
chemotherapy before registration. One could also argue
that the age limit of the trial was too low to address geriatric issues; however, the majority of patients were aged 70
to 80 years, an age group among which clinical uncertainty regarding whether to administer a taxane is largest.
Tolerability of the treatment might have been better and
more suited for an elderly population with a lower capecitabine dose (eg, 850 mg/m2).
The results of the ICE II trial demonstrated that
nonfrail elderly patients with moderate or high-risk breast
cancer could be treated with taxane-based polychemotherapy; however, compound-specific toxicities lowered relative dose intensity and, together with a higher incidence
of death during treatment, lower potential survival
benefits.
