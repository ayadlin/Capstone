ABSTRACT
The calcium–sensing receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that exerts cell-type
specific functions in numerous tissues and some cancers. We have previously reported
that this receptor exhibits tumor suppressor properties in neuroblastoma. We have
now assessed cinacalcet, an allosteric activator of the CaSR approved for clinical use,
as targeted therapy for this developmental tumor using neuroblastoma cell lines and
patient-derived xenografts (PDX) with different MYCN and TP53 status. In vitro, acute
exposure to cinacalcet induced endoplasmic reticulum stress coupled to apoptosis
via ATF4-CHOP-TRB3 in CaSR-positive, MYCN-amplified cells. Both phenotypes were
partially abrogated by phospholipase C inhibitor U73122. Prolonged in vitro treatment
also promoted dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in CaSR-positive, MYCN-amplified
cells and, irrespective of MYCN status, differentiation in surviving cells. Cinacalcet
significantly inhibited tumor growth in MYCN-amplified xenografts and reduced that of
MYCN-non amplified PDX. Morphology assessment showed fibrosis in MYCN-amplified
xenografts exposed to the drug. Microarrays analyses revealed up-regulation of
cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) in cinacalcet-treated MYCN-amplified tumors. These
were predominantly CTAs encoded by genes mapping on chromosome X, which are
the most immunogenic. Other modulated genes upon prolonged exposure to cinacalcet
were involved in differentiation, cell cycle exit, microenvironment remodeling and
calcium signaling pathways. CTAs were up-regulated in PDX and in vitro models as
well. Moreover, progressive increase of CaSR expression upon cinacalcet treatment
was seen both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, cinacalcet reduces neuroblastoma
tumor growth and up-regulates CTAs. This effect represents a therapeutic opportunity
and provides surrogate circulating markers of neuroblastoma response to this
treatment.

S1A). Two MYCN-amplified cell lines were previously
transfected with pCMV-CaSR-GFP or pCMV-GFP [15].
CaSR protein expression was also present in the
neuroblastoma metastasis from which a PDX model was
generated (Supplementary Figure S1A). However, this
model did not grow in vitro and therefore was only used
for in vivo studies. A second MYCN-non amplified model
was generated for in vitro analyses by stable transfection
of SH-SY5Y cells (Supplementary Figure S1B and S1C).
We have previously reported that acute exposure
to high extracellular calcium (Ca2+o) concentrations
following serum deprivation [18] induces apoptotic cell
death in CaSR-overexpressing neuroblastoma cells [15].
To assess whether cinacalcet is able to increase this effect,
SK-N-LP cells were exposed to DMSO or cinacalcet in
serum deprivation media. As shown in Figure 1, cinacalcet
(doses ranging between 0.1 and 1 μM) increased cleavage
of PARP and caspases-4, -3 , -7 and -9 produced by either
0.5 (Figure 1A) or 3 mM CaCl2 (Figure 1B) in CaSRoverexpressing cells in a time- (not shown) and dosedependent manner, even if 3 mM CaCl2 was already a
potent apoptotic stimulus.
In LA-N-1 cells, cinacalcet also induced apoptosis
in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Analyses by flow
cytometry of annexin V-propidium iodide stained cells
showed a not statistically significant increase of apoptotic
cells upon exposure to cinacalcet (Figure 1C). This effect
was only seen at high doses, in accordance with the
reduced levels of CaSR expression present in this cell line.
These doses of cinacalcet also prompted increased
cleavage of caspases-4 and -7 in LA-N-1 cells, an
additional evidence of ER stress mediated apoptosis
(Figure 1D). In these experiments, tunicamycin (TN) was
used as a positive control of ER-stress induced activation
of caspase-4, an effect promoted by its capacity to induce
Ca2+ exit from the ER [19].

cases display a notable capacity to recur and/or become
refractory and, unfortunately, there is no therapy known
to be curative for them [2].
Several genetic and epigenetic abnormalities have
been associated with this variety of clinical presentations,
including alterations of ploidy, chromosomal aberrations,
MYCN amplification and mutations of ALK [35]. However, few of them are actionable [5]. Long
before many of them were described, differentiated
neuroblastic tumors were reported to be associated
with favorable outcome [6]. Cytodifferentiation can be
pharmacologically induced in neuroblastoma models [710] and, owing to its differentiating properties, retinoic
acid has become part of the standard of care of high-risk
neuroblastomas [11].
Our group described a gene potentially involved in
the differentiation pathways of neuroblastic tumors, the
calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). CaSR was first reported
as a family C G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that
senses plasmatic fluctuations of Ca2+ and regulates the
secretion of parathyroid hormone accordingly [12]. This
GPCR is also expressed in many organs not involved in
calcium homeostasis and in some neoplasias in which it
plays cell-type specific functions [13]. Our initial work
showed that CaSR is expressed in benign, differentiated
neuroblastic tumors and up-regulated upon differentiation
induction [14]. Next, we reported that the CaSR gene
is silenced by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in
MYCN-amplified, unfavorable neuroblastomas [15].
Accordingly, ectopic overexpression of the CaSR
significantly reduced the proliferative and tumorigenic
capacities of neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, CaSRpositive cells underwent apoptosis upon acute reactivation
of the receptor with calcium, its main orthosteric ligand
[15]. In keeping with these findings, a tri-locus haplotype
containing a moderately inactivating variant of the CaSR
was associated with undifferentiated histology, metastatic
disease and poor outcome [16].
Altogether, our published data were consistent with
the hypothesis that the CaSR exerts tumor-suppressor
functions in neuroblastoma. Thus, we next sought to
evaluate whether cinacalcet, an allosteric activator
of the CaSR approved for clinical use [17], might
reduce neuroblastoma tumor cell growth. Based on our
previous work, we hypothesized that it could promote
cytodifferentiation and/or cell death.

Cinacalcet-induced apoptosis in MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cells is prompted
by ER stress and both are dependent on
activation of phospholipase C
We hypothesized that apoptosis following acute
exposure to cinacalcet might be prompted by activation
of phospholipase C (PLC), IP3-mediated calcium leak
from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and consequent ER
stress. Consistent with this mechanism, increased levels of
GRP78, ATF4 and P-eIF2α (Figure 2A), as well as a not
statistically significant up-regulation of CHOP and TRB3
mRNA (Figure 2B), were detected in neuroblastoma cells
following cinacalcet exposure in a time-, dose-, calciumand CaSR-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2A
and S2B).
Moreover, PLC inhibitor U73122 abrogated
phosphorylation of eIF2α in LA-N-1 cells at all
doses of cinacalcet examined (Figure 2C). U73122

RESULTS
Acute exposure to cinacalcet triggers apoptosis
in neuroblastoma cells
Among available neuroblastoma cell lines, only
LA-N-1 cells exhibited detectable endogenous CaSR
mRNA expression [15]. Low levels of CaSR protein
were present in these cells as well (Supplementary Figure

cinacalcet (Figure 2D). More importantly, cleavage
of caspase-3 (Figure 2E) and decreased cell viability
(Figure 2F) induced by cinacalcet in CaSR-positive

neuroblastoma cells were significantly reduced by
U73122.
As expected [20], ER stress and consequent
apoptosis were not induced in MYCN-non amplified SHSY5Y cells (Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D).

Chronic exposure to cinacalcet induces
apoptosis and differentiation in surviving
neuroblastoma cells

evaluated by RT-qPCR (Table 1). Increased expression
of transcripts associated with ER stress was mostly
seen in MYCN-amplified cells (Table 1). Also, higher
induction of differentiation markers was detected in SKN-LP cells, which exhibit a less differentiated phenotype
than LA-N-1 and SH-SY5Y cell lines (Table 1) [21]. In
keeping with differentiation induction, MYCN mRNA
levels decreased in MYCN-amplified cells, together with
down-regulation of inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2)
and reverse transcription telomerase (TERT) in the three
models. Interestingly, up-regulation of CaSR mRNA was
seen in the three cell lines exposed to cinacalcet (Table 1).

A concentration-dependent decrease of cell
viability was observed in neuroblastoma cell lines
exposed to cinacalcet or another calcimimetic, NPS
R-568. Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values of cinacalcet were significantly lower than those
of NPS R-568 in most cases. However, similar IC50 values
were obtained in human fibroblasts and HEK-293 cells
(Supplementary Figure S3A).
When the same neuroblastoma cell lines were
allowed to proliferate in the presence of concentrations
lower than IC50 for 5 days, a moderate dose- and timedependent decrease of cell viability was detected in CaSRpositive cells (Supplementary Figure S3B). This was only
seen in CaSR-negative cells at higher concentrations
(Supplementary Figure S3C). This phenotype was rescued
by pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Supplementary
Figure S3D and S3E), but differences between CaSRpositive and –negative cells were modest.
Next, LA-N-1 cells and SK-N-LP and SH-SY5Y
transfected models were cultured in the presence of
0.5-1 μM cinacalcet or DMSO for 14 days. Increased
cleavage of PARP was seen in cinacalcet-treated cells and
this output was dependent on CaSR expression, time of
exposure (Figure 3A) and dose (Figure 3B). In surviving
cells, morphological features of neuronal differentiation
such as extensive neurite outgrowth were already apparent
at day 3 and reached maximal expression between days
7 and 14 (Figure 3C). Several transcripts associated with
cytodifferentiation (Figure 3D), cell cycle exit, ER stress
(Figure 3E) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) (Figure 3F) were concomitantly up-regulated, as

Cinacalcet inhibits neuroblastoma tumor growth
in vivo and upregulates cancer-testis antigens
Immunocompromised mice carrying xenografts with
different MYCN and TP53 status received either vehicle
or cinacalcet until tumors reached 2 cm3. Mild, nonsymptomatic, hypocalcemia was documented (Figure 4A).
No signs of toxicity were observed (not shown).
In the first experiment conducted with MYCNamplified, TP53-null xenografts, significant tumor growth
inhibition was observed (Figure 4B). This experiment
was replicated and pooled data showed higher statistical
significance (Figure 4C). Inhibition of PDX growth showed
a similar tendency (Figure 4D).
Fibrin clots and heavy collagen deposition around
tumor vessels were identified in LA-N-1 xenografts
following cinacalcet treatment (Figure 4E). Both findings
were significantly less frequent in cinacalcet-treated PDX
(not shown). Occasionally, fibrosis invaded vast areas of
LA-N-1 specimens, but no evidence of fibrosis was found
in normal organs (not shown). Immunohistochemistry
revealed that most cells involved in microenvironment

remodeling, including tumor vessels and fibroblasts, were
of murine origin (Figure 4F). Thus, microarrays analyses
and RT-qPCR were conducted to analyze human and
murine transcripts.
First, a genome-wide expression analysis was
performed to compare human gene expression profiles
in vehicle- and cinacalcet-treated LA-N-1 xenografts.
Low stringency analyses (P-value≤0.01) identified 61 upregulated and 32 down-regulated transcripts (Figure 5A
and Supplementary Table S2, first sheet). This gene set
included only 14 probes with a log fold change value
>1 in cinacalcet-treated tumors. Interestingly, 10 (71%)
of them hybridized with cancer-testis antigens (CTAs)
genes. However, these differences were not statistically
significant after P-value adjustment. Nonetheless, in this
first heat map it was apparent that a group of genes was
specifically modulated in the three tumors exposed to the
longest period of treatment.
This was confirmed by a second analysis that
examined differentially expressed genes in these three
specimens exposed to prolonged cinacalcet treatment (C9C11) compared to the eight control tumors. In this analysis,
adjusted P-value (false discovery rate, FDR) <0.05 and
absolute log fold change >1 were considered significant.
This approach identified a gene profile encompassing
34 probes corresponding to 32 up-regulated and 2 downregulated transcripts (Figure 5B), Supplementary Table S2,
second sheet). Among the first group, 11 (32.3 %) probes
hybridized with CTAs. These were X-CTAs, i.e. CTAs
encoded by genes mapping on chromosome X (GAGE
family and SSX4/4B). The GAGE family was up-regulated
in the first analysis and in vitro models as well (Table 1).
Interestingly, other up-regulated genes in this second heat
map included protein kinase C, alpha (PRKCA), ryanodine
receptor 2 (RYR2) and gamma-aminobutyric-A receptor,
alpha-3 (GABRA3).
Validation of microarrays data and analysis of
relevant candidate genes was conducted by RT-qPCR
(Table 2, Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure S4A).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

These analyses included two genes with a level of
significance right below the cut-off value in the second
heat map given their biological relevance, a non-X
CTA, CCCTC-binding factor (zinc finger protein)-like
(CTCFL), and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor,
type 3 (NTRK3). Up-regulation of CTAs of the GAGE
family was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 5C).
As shown in Table 2 and Supplementary Figure
S4A, besides SSX4/4B and the GAGE family, other
X-CTAs (MAGE-A2, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1) and
CTCFL, were up-regulated in MYCN-amplified specimens
exposed to prolonged cinacalcet treatment. In PDX, only
CTAs of the GAGE family were up-regulated. Increased
expression of genes involved in differentiation, ER
stress and EMT was also found in both models, but more
robustly in MYCN-amplified xenografts.
To identify relevant biological processes promoted
by cinacalcet in neuroblastoma, Gene Ontology (GO)
enrichment analysis was conducted (Supplementary Table
S3, first sheet). Overrepresented processes among upregulated genes were calcium-signaling pathways and ion
transport (adenylyl cyclase type 8 -ADCY8-, RYR2 and
PRKCA), cell adhesion, differentiation (GABRA3, NTRK3)
and also CTAs. Among down-regulated genes, which were
less abundant, transcription factors were overrepresented,
notably inhibitor of differentiation 2 -ID2- and v-myb
avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog -MYB-.
Next, a search for molecular pathways in which
those genes might participate was conducted with
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). The most significant
network included up-regulation of RYR2 and NTRK3,
together with down-regulation of ID2 and fibronectin
-FN1- (Figure 5D and Supplementary Table S3, second
sheet). Other top networks were involved in gene
regulation, cell death and survival.
Genome-wide expression analyses of murine
genes did not find statistically significant differences
between vehicle- and cinacalcet-treated xenografts

up-regulation of RYR2. Intracellular Ca2+ leak via RYR2
and consequent depleted ER stores have been associated
with ER stress in pancreatic β cells [24]. Up-regulation
of ADCY8 represented another in vivo indication of Ca2+
leak from the ER. In non-excitable cells, ADCY8 is
predominantly stimulated by Ca2+ ions entering the cells
via capacitative calcium entry, a mechanism triggered
by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores [25]. Moreover,
CNBD1 (cyclic nucleotide-binding domain-containing
protein 1) was also up-regulated in the second heat map
[26]. Further studies will be necessary to establish whether
increased expression of this domain is an indication of
cAMP production by ADCY8 or whether CaSR might
couple to Gs in this cellular context.
We next evaluated the effects of sustained in vitro
exposure to cinacalcet. Apoptosis was also detected in
MYCN-amplified cells. Other mechanisms of cell death,
including necroptosis, might concur. Moreover, surviving
CaSR-positive cells, irrespective of MYCN status,
displayed morphological signs and expression patterns
consistent with differentiation induction and cell cycle
exit. These effects were more pronounced in cells with
a less differentiated phenotype [21]. Microarrays data
also showed up-regulation of two genes associated with
benign neuroblastomas, GABRA3 [27] and NTRK3 [28],
following prolonged exposure to cinacalcet. Concurrently,
ID2, MYB and FN1 were down-regulated. ID2 is a helixloop-helix transcription factor that acts under the control
of MYC proteins, blocks differentiation and stimulates
cell proliferation [29]. MYB is a transcription factor that
cooperates with MYCN in cell cycle regulation of MYCNamplified neuroblastomas [30]. By RT-qPCR, we also found
a moderate down-regulation of MYCN in PDX and in vitro
models. Down-regulation of MYCN, ID2, TERT and FN1
has been also reported in neuroblastoma cells undergoing
differentiation upon exposure to retinoids [7-10]. Induction
of TERT in LA-N-1 xenografts might be associated with
fibrosis [31]. Interestingly, up-regulation of synaptopodin-2
(SYNPO) could be an additional indication of MYCN
down-regulation, as its main upstream regulator, DKK3, is
negatively modulated by MYCN [32, 33].
Prolonged in vitro exposure to cinacalcet
reproduced quite notably other effects induced by this
drug in vivo, namely up-regulation of CTAs. This good
correlation between our in vitro and in vivo findings
makes less likely that hypocalcemia and associated
hormonal changes account for the phenotypes observed
in vivo. CTAs encompass a large family of antigens that
are considered ideal targets for immunotherapy given
their almost tumor-specific pattern of expression and
strong immunoreactivity [34]. However, the efficacy
of CTA-based immunotherapies is hampered by the
remarkable inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity
expression of these antigens. Attempts to increase
their expression have relied on epigenetic modifiers,
taking into account the primary mechanism regulating

(Supplementary Table S2, third sheet, and Supplementary
Figure S5A). However, Gene Ontology (Supplementary
Table S3, third sheet) and IPA (Supplementary Figure
S5B and Supplementary Table S3, fourth sheet) analyses
showed gene expression changes consistent with
microenvironment remodeling and angiogenesis, most
notably jagged-1, semaphorin-5B and neuropilin-2.
Consequently, a number of candidate genes
were analyzed by RT-qPCR taking into account that
both human and murine cells seemed to participate in
microenvironment remodeling. Down-regulation of
human vascular specific cadherin CDH5 and up-regulation
of mesenchymal markers (COL1A1, VIM) was detected
following cinacalcet treatment. More prominent changes
of murine gene expression consistent with angiogenesis
and fibrosis were seen in cinacalcet-treated MYCNamplified xenografts (Table 2).
Finally, RT-qPCR detected a moderate up-regulation
of CaSR mRNA upon prolonged treatment with cinacalcet in
MYCN-amplified xenografts (Table 2, Supplementary Figure
S4B). This was confirmed at the protein level by Western
blot (Supplementary Figure S4C). In PDX, only a modest
up-regulation was noted at the mRNA level (Table 2).
Altogether, in vivo data were consistent with those
produced in vitro and supported that prolonged exposure
to cinacalcet induces ER stress, differentiation and fibrosis
in neuroblastoma together with upregulation of CTAs.

DISCUSSION
Refractory neuroblastomas remain a remarkable
clinical challenge and novel therapeutic strategies are
needed to change the uniformly fatal outcome of these
patients. Our present data show a targeted therapy that
reduces neuroblastoma tumor growth and induces upregulation of CTAs, thus paving the way for novel
immunotherapeutic approaches and combination
treatments.
Our first analyses were based on our previous
findings and showed that acute exposure to cinacalcet
triggers ER stress and apoptosis in CaSR-positive,
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, dependent on
phospholipase C activation. Massive calcium release from
the ER is a potent inducer of ER stress, and cancer cells are
especially susceptible to this injury [22]. We focused on
GRP78-ATF4-PeIF2α as this pathway has been reported
to mediate ER stress-induced cell death in neuroblastoma
[20]. Induction of these molecules was followed by upregulation of CHOP and TRB3, an indication of ER stress
coupled to cell death [23]. Also, according to an ERcentered mechanism of apoptosis, cinacalcet activated
caspase-4, together with other caspases of the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway [19]. In keeping with literature, MYCNnon amplified cells were less sensitive to ER stress [20].
Microarrays analyses provided in vivo evidence that
cinacalcet triggers ER stress in neuroblastoma, including

CTAs transcription [35]. To our surprise, cinacalcet
induced a robust up-regulation of several CTAs in all
neuroblastoma models examined. Up-regulated CTAs
were mainly encoded by genes mapping on chromosome
X (GAGE, MAGE, SSX4 families and NY-ESO-1), which
are the most immunogenic, and less significantly a non-X
CTA, CTCFL. It has been reported that p53 strongly
represses CTCFL expression [36]. Accordingly, CTCFL
was only up-regulated in the TP53-null model. Given
that CTCFL regulates other CTAs, mainly the MAGE
family [37], it is also likely that lack of MAGEs upregulation in cinacalcet-treated PDX is partially due to
the normal activity of p53 in these tumors.
Expression of GAGE antigens has been reported in
neuroblastoma [38]. However, the roles of CTAs in cancer
remain ill-defined, and some evidences indicate that they
support cancer cell survival, invasion or migration [39],
but expression of CTAs has been associated with better
outcome in glioblastoma patients [40]. Our results show
up-regulation of CTAs in xenografts displaying slower
growth rates and in three in vitro models undergoing
differentiation upon cinacalcet exposure. Thus, while
further studies are warranted to establish the function of
these molecules in cancer, up-regulation of CTAs in our
models is not associated with increased neuroblastoma
aggressiveness. Moreover, this effect might promote
higher effectiveness of CTA-based immunotherapies and
provide surrogate circulating markers of neuroblastoma
response to cinacalcet.
CaSR activation has been described to promote
cardiac fibrosis [41]. In contrast, cinacalcet seems to
reduce collagen deposition in models of kidney failure
[42] and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers is also
associated with CaSR activation in colon cancer cell lines
[43]. In MYCN-amplified xenografts, cinacalcet treatment
was associated with induction of fibrosis while normal
organs were not affected. Indeed, fibrosis of refractory
tumors would be clinically beneficial. Apoptosis and
ER stress could be among initiating events. Although
apoptosis was originally described to eliminate cells
without disturbing surrounding tissues, more recent
evidences support that it might promote fibrosis [44].
Chronic ER stress is also a potent pro-fibrotic stimulus
[45]. Although host cells were noticeably cooperating in
microenvironment remodeling, a number of transcripts
associated with EMT or mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition were modulated in vitro as well. The complex
gene expression patterns observed most likely reflect
overlapping phases of fibrosis taking place simultaneously
given the persistent, but intermittent, nature of the
triggering injury. Nevertheless, the final output indicates
that cinacalcet is mostly a pro-fibrotic stimulus in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas. A factor potentially
contributing to the lesser extent of fibrosis in PDX, besides
being less susceptible to ER stress, is normal p53 function
[46].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Last but not least, cinacalcet also promoted CaSR
up-regulation. This finding is in accordance with literature
[47] and would be clinically relevant should cinacalcet
be used as a treatment for this tumor. Most unfavorable
neuroblastomas exhibit low levels of CaSR expression,
and enforced expression of the receptor notably reduces
neuroblastoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity
[15]. Thus, increase of CaSR expression upon cinacalcet
treatment would reduce neuroblastoma aggressiveness
by itself, and additionally promote a more pronounced
response to the drug over time.
In summary, we show that cinacalcet inhibits
neuroblastoma tumor growth by promoting differentiation,
ER stress, apoptosis and/or fibrosis depending on time of
exposure and cellular context. Cinacalcet also up-regulates
CTAs in neuroblastoma thus providing novel opportunities
for CTA-based immunotherapies and circulating surrogate
markers of neuroblastoma response to this treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Seven neuroblastoma cell lines (LA-N-1, LA1-55n,
SH-SY5Y, SK-N-JD, SK-N-LP, LA1-5s and SK-N-AS)
exhibiting different degrees of differentiation [21], HEK293 cells and human fibroblasts were obtained from the
repository at Institut de Recerca Pediàtrica - Hospital
Sant Joan de Déu (Barcelona, Spain). Unless otherwise
specified, they were grown in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 2 mM
L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100
μg/mL), at 37ºC and 5% CO2.. Mycoplasma polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) tests were routinely performed.
Characterization of cell lines included analysis of MYCN
amplification [14], TP53 sequence and authentication by
STR profiles.

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, PCR and qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Sigma,
St Louis, MO). Retrotranscription, PCR and qPCR were
carried out as described [14, 15]. Real-time PCR runs
were performed in a 7500 SDS system using genespecific Assays on Demand and Taqman Universal PCR
Master Mix, or specific primers (Supplementary Table
S1) and SYBRGreen (Applied Biosystems, Forster
City, CA). Relative expression levels were calculated
according to the 2-ΔΔCt method using TATA-box binding
protein (TBP) as normalizing gene. Only samples with
a TBP Ct lower than 30 were used to ensure RNA
and cDNA quality. Quantitative PCR runs conducted
according to these procedures were shown to produce
highly consistent data (coefficient of variation < 5%, not
shown).

Cell viability and proliferation assays

IRDye680RD goat-anti-mouse IgG (Li-COR #926-68070)
or IRDye800CW goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Li-COR #92632211) were used and blots were visualized with Li-COR
Odyssey system (Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).

Cells were plated into 96-well plates in RPMI1640 10% FBS. Six replicate wells were seeded for each
cell line and condition. Next day, they were treated with
cinacalcet (Selleckchem, Houston, TX), NPS R-568
(Tocris, Minneapolis, MN) or DMSO. Viability was
measured with CellTiter96 Aqueous Cell Proliferation
Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) 72 hours later. IC50
(i.e. drug concentrations achieving 50% decrease in
cell viability) were determined with GraphPad Prism
software. The same experiments were performed in the
presence or absence of 20 μM Z-VAD-FMK (Promega).
Proliferation rates were assessed as reported [15].
To examine the combined effects of cinacalcet and
U73122 (Sigma) on cell viability, cells were plated in 24well plates in RPMI-1640 10% FBS. Four replicate wells
were seeded for each cell line and condition. Next day,
media were replaced by calcium-free Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with
bovine serum albumin (0.2% w/v), 4 mM L-glutamine
and 0.5 mM CaCl2 (these conditions will be mentioned
as serum deprivation media) for 16 hours. Cultures were
then exposed to cinacalcet in the same media containing
0.5 mM or 3 mM CaCl2 and/or U73122. Cell viability was
determined as above.

Mouse xenograft models
Procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Research Ethics Committee. Two in vivo models
were generated in four to six-week-old female athymic
Nude-Foxn1 nu/nu mice (Charles River, Wilmington,
MA). LA-N-1 cells generated a CaSR-positive model
bearing MYCN amplification and mutation of TP53. A
tumor fragment was obtained from the liver metastasis of a
stage 4 neuroblastoma without these two genetic alterations.
Written informed consent was obtained and procedures
were approved by the Institutional Review Board. The
tumor was subcutaneously inoculated and allowed to grow
up to 2 cm3 to generate a patient-derived xenograft (PDX).
LA-N-1 cells (107) resuspended in Matrigel:PBS
(Becton Dickinson) or PDX fragments were
subcutaneously inoculated. Tumors were allowed to
grow until dimensions reached 7x7 mm. Mice were
then randomized to receive either vehicle or cinacalcet
(10 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage 6 days per week until
tumor volume reached 2 cm3. Cinacalcet was prepared
with Mimpara® tablets. Following homogenization in a
mortar, the resulting powder was reconstituted with 0.5%
Tween 20 (20%, v/v) and carboxymethylcellulose (0.25%,
w/v) to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL. Each dose
contained 5 μL of this mixture per gram of mouse weight.
Dimensions of tumors were measured thrice a week using
a digital caliper. Tumor volume was calculated as L x W2/2
in which “L” indicates length in mm and “W” indicates
width in mm. At the end of the experiment, tumors were
excised and half of each specimen was frozen in liquid
nitrogen and the other was fixed in 10% formalin.

Apoptosis assays
Cells were seeded in RPMI-1640 10% FBS. Next
day, they were grown in serum deprivation media for 16
hours. Cultures were then exposed to cinacalcet for 8 or 24
hours in the same media containing 0.5 mM or 3 mM CaCl2.
Floating and adherent cells were collected and stained
with Annexin V-FITC Detection Kit (Life Technologies,
Carslbad, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells
were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur System
and results were processed with CellQuest software (Becton
Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

Ionized calcium concentrations in blood
Blood samples (100 μL) were collected from facial
veins of control and cinacalcet-treated mice once a week
during the first six weeks of treatment. Extractions were
performed before drug/vehicle administration. Ionized
calcium concentrations were measured using an EPOC
Reader (Alere Healthcare, Waltham, MA).

Immunoblots
Cells were exposed to cinacalcet or DMSO, collected
in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH=6.8, 1
mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS. Thirty to fifty μg
proteins were electrophoresed in 8-14% SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Incubation
with primary antibodies (caspase-3, caspase-4, caspase-7,
caspase-9, cleaved PARP, eIF2α, P-eIF2α, GRP78 (Cell
Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), CaSR (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), ATF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX), α-tubulin (Sigma)) was followed by horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega).
Immunoreactive bands were detected with enhanced
chemiluminiscence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia,
Piscataway, NJ). Alternatively, secondary antibody

Immunohistochemistry
Sections (4 μm) of formalin fixed, paraffinembedded tumors were stained with haematoxylineosin (H&E), Masson’s trichrome or processed for
immunohistochemistry to analyze CaSR expression as
described [14]. A similar protocol was carried out with
anti-GAGE7 (Life Technologies) and anti-human nuclei,
clone -3E1.3 (Merck-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).

and “Xarxa de Tumors de Catalunya” for sample
procurement. This study was supported by grants from
Fundació Privada Cellex and Spanish Ministry of Health
(FIS PI14/00040) to CdT.

Total RNA was isolated from 8 xenografts exposed
to cinacalcet and 8 receiving vehicle in the first survival
experiment. These were the last 8 tumors excised in each
group. Genome-wide expression analyses were performed
using Affymetrix Human Gene Array 2.1 ST and Mouse
Gene Array 2.1 ST (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as per
manufacturer’s protocol. Microarrays data were analyzed
at the Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit of Vall d’Hebron
Research Institute (Barcelona, Spain). After standard
quality controls, a cinacalcet-treated sample (C6) was
considered an outlier under the criteria of distance between
arrays and intensity distribution [48] and excluded from
further analyses. Robust Multi-array Average (RMA)
algorithm was used for pre-processing microarray. In
order to minimize the effect of P-value adjustment that
multiple testing implies, normalized data were subjected
to non-specific filtering to remove low (50%) signal and
low (50%) variability genes. Selection of differentially
expressed genes was based on a linear model analysis with
empirical Bayes modification for the variance estimates.
To account for multiple testing, P-values were adjusted
to obtain stronger control over the false discovery rate
(FDR). Differentially expressed genes (P-value ≤0.01)
obtained from comparing the three xenografts exposed
to the longest treatment with cinacalcet (C9-C11) to all
control tumors were used as input for a gene enrichment
analysis against the Gene Ontology [49] using DAVID
tool, which performs Fisher Exact tests to compare the
proportion of significant genes found on each GO category
[50]. A more restrictive gene set (adjusted P-value ≤0.25
and absolute log fold change >0.5) was analyzed using
QIAGEN’s Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis. Microarray
data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus
database (Accession number GSE73509).
