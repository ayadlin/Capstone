Abstract
Most tumors circumvent telomere-length imposed replicative limits through
expression of telomerase, the reverse transcriptase that maintains telomere
length. Substantial evidence that AKT activity is required for telomerase activity
exists, indicating that AKT inhibitors may also function as telomerase inhibitors.
This possibility has not been investigated in a clinical context despite many clinical
trials evaluating AKT inhibitors. We tested if Perifosine, an AKT inhibitor in clinical
trials, inhibits telomerase activity and telomere maintenance in tissue culture and
orthotopic xenograft models as well as in purified CLL samples from a phase II
Perifosine clinical trial. We demonstrate that Perifosine inhibits telomerase activity
and induces telomere shortening in a wide variety of cell lines in vitro, though there
is substantial heterogeneity in long-term responses to Perifosine between cell lines.
Perifosine did reduce primary breast cancer orthotopic xenograft tumor size, but
did not impact metastatic burden in a statistically significant manner. However,
Perifosine reduced telomerase activity in four of six CLL patients evaluated. Two of the
patients were treated for four to six months and shortening of the shortest telomeres
occurred in both patients’ cells. These results indicate that it may be possible to
repurpose Perifosine or other AKT pathway inhibitors as a novel approach to targeting
telomerase.

Introduction

proliferative stem cell compartments by telomerase, a
ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that uses its RNA
component, hTR/hTERC, to template the addition of new
telomere repeats onto the ends of the telomeres. Because
catalytically active telomerase is not expressed in most
human somatic tissue, reactivation of telomerase is a
barrier that nearly all cancer cells must overcome in order
to become a life-threatening tumor [4].
Activation of telomerase is one of the most common
perturbations observed in malignancy, present in roughly
90% of tumors [5]. Given this high rate of activation
in tumors, low redundancy in telomere maintenance
mechanisms and the absence of telomerase activity in
most somatic cell compartments, telomerase inhibitors
could be effective against a broad spectrum of tumors

The ends of chromosomes are protected from
recognition as double strand DNA breaks by telomeres,
nucleoprotein structures on the ends of the chromosomes
which consist of telomeric TTAGGG repeats and
telomere-binding proteins known collectively as the
Shelterin complex (TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, TPP1, POT1 and
Rap1) [1]. Because of the end replication problem and
difficulty in repairing telomeric DNA damage, telomeres
shorten in telomerase-negative human cells at a rate of
50-100 base pairs per cell division [2]. When telomeres
become sufficiently short, an unrepairable DNA damage
signal initiates a p53/p21-mediated growth arrest [3]. This
process is partially prevented in the germ line and certain

with minimal effects on most normal tissues. There are a
number of telomerase inhibitors in clinical testing, notably
Imetelstat, an oligonucleotide competitive inhibitor of the
telomerase active site [6]. Recent setbacks in the clinical
trajectories of telomerase inhibitors [7] underscore the
need for new strategies for telomerase inhibition.
AKT, also known as Protein Kinase B, is a serine/
threonine kinase downstream of PI3K, important in a
wide variety of signaling events [8]. The protein subunit
of telomerase, TERT, has two consensus RXRXXS/T
AKT phosphorylation motifs at S227 and S824, both of
which are involved in proper nuclear localization of the
telomerase holoenzyme [9, 10]. AKT, HSP90, mTOR and
S6 kinase form a complex with TERT [11], and Rapamycin
has been reported to reduce telomerase activity [12]. These
studies provide the rationale that inhibition of AKT may
be a viable anti-telomerase strategy.
Perifosine is an orally available alkylphospholipid
in phase III clinical trials for multiple myeloma.
Perifosine inhibits AKT activity by interfering with
the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT, preventing
its membrane localization and phosphorylation [13].
Perifosine’s oral availability, long half-life in blood
(~100 hours) and low side effect profile [14] make it an
excellent candidate for use as an AKT-mediated antitelomerase therapy, as any anti-telomerase maintenance
therapy must be tolerable for long periods of time.
Here, we report that low, clinically achievable doses of
Perifosine (1.84 µM and 4.6 µM) can induce progressive
telomere shortening in a variety of cell lines from multiple
tumor cell backgrounds without accelerating telomere
shortening in telomerase negative fibroblasts. We also
show that long-term Perifosine treatment can reduce
soft agar colony formation to a greater extent than acute
Perifosine treatment. Further, using both a xenograft
model of an anti-telomerase therapy protocol and
clinical samples from human CLL patients treated with
Perifosine in a phase II clinical trial, we show that longterm Perifosine treatment inhibits telomerase activity and
reduced the shortest telomere lengths over time in vivo.

and 4.6 uM Perifosine (1/8th and 1/2 of the Hela LD50,
respectively) because the blood concentrations from
orally-available doses of Perifosine are reported to be the
same order of magnitude as the LD50 for a number of cell
lines including Hela cells [14, 16]. We observed that 12
of 20 cell lines exhibited telomere shortening after PD 20
(Figure 1A) with a high degree of heterogeneity. Perifosine
did not alter the normal rate of telomere shortening in the
BJ fibroblast telomerase negative cell line, suggesting
telomere shortening was telomerase-dependent. Extended
Perifosine exposure continued to drive telomere shortening
in Hela cells, but did not accelerate telomere shortening
in BJ fibroblasts (Figure 1B). Treatment with Perifosine
also altered telomerase enzymatic activity in most but
not all cell lines tested (Figure 1C). Some cell lines with
reduced telomerase activity did not exhibit telomere
shortening. Additionally, AKT inhibitor IV, another AKT
inhibitor induced telomere shortening upon continuous
administration, though two other compounds that target
this pathway did not cause telomere shortening (Figure
S5).
To determine if Perifosine exposure and concomitant
telomere shortening could impact growth parameters via
a subset of critically short telomeres, we performed a
soft agar colony formation assay on Hela cells that had
not been treated with Perifosine (control cells), Hela
cells treated with Perifosine during the soft agar colony
formation assay (transient treated cells), and Hela cells
treated with Perifosine for 70 population doublings prior
to the assay and during the assay (long-term treated cells).
Long-term Perifosine treatment significantly (p = 0.04)
reduced the number of colonies per well, while transient
treatment with Perifosine did not induce a statistically
significant reduction in colony number (Figure 1D).

Metastatic xenograft test of perifosine as a
telomerase inhibitor
Though other telomerase inhibitors have been
tested in xenograft models, measurement of the telomeres
from human tumor cells separated from mouse support
cells extracted from a xenograft has not been reported
[17-20]. To determine if Perifosine can influence the
growth and telomere dynamics of tumor cells in a more
physiologically relevant setting, we developed a human
breast cancer xenograft model that allowed long-term
primary and metastatic tumor growth, followed by
extraction of human cells and measurement of telomeres
with minimal mouse cell contamination (see methods).
HCC38 breast cancer cells were selected because they
respond strongly to low doses of Perifosine in vitro and
they exhibit very short baseline telomere length (Figure
1A).
Treatment with Perifosine reduced primary tumor
size compared with untreated tumors (Figure 2A), though
long-term treatment with doses sufficient to induce

Results
In vitro effects of perifosine on telomerase activity
and telomere length
To evaluate the effects of Perifosine on telomere
length and telomerase activity, we cultured a panel
of cell lines exposed to clinically relevant Perifosine
concentrations for extended periods of time. Due to the
heterogeneity in signaling dependence in cancer cell
lines [15], we decided to test the way telomere biology
responded to Perifosine in a large panel of cell lines
(Table S1). We assayed cell lines treated with 1.84 uM

telomere shortening in vitro did not produce a statistically
significant reduction in recurrent primary or metastatic
tumor burden as measured by luciferase signal intensity
(Figure 2B). There was no significant difference of mean
telomere length between control and treated tumors
of any type, though telomeres from recurrent primary
tumors and lung metastatic tumors were significantly
shorter compared to primary tumors in the treatment
group, indicating that Perifosine may have functioned as a
telomerase inhibitor in vivo but longer treatments may be
required (Figure 2C).

cancer [21, 22]. Most applications of Perifosine feature
cycles of exposure followed by non-exposure, limiting
the applicability of these trials as models of Perifosinemediated telomere shortening. However, one trial [23]
tested continuous low-dose Perifosine exposure in CLL
patients, and we were able to assay telomere length and
telomerase activity in purified tumor samples from a
subset of these patients with remaining usable samples.
Samples from two patients who had been treated
for 4 and 5 cycles (112 and 140 days) were available
from before therapy, cycle 1 day 8, cycle 4 day 1 (day
84), and at discontinuation of treatment, while four other
patients had samples from before initiation of therapy
and at cycle 1, day 8. Telomerase enzymatic activity was
reduced at cycle 1 day 8 in four of the six patients tested.
Telomerase activity was lower than before initiation of
therapy at discontinuation in both patients treated for 4
or more months (Figure 3A). However, mean telomere

shortening over 20 population doublings of exposure in a variety of cancer cell types, while Perifosine did not accelerate telomere shortening
in the telomerase negative BJ fibroblast line A., though there was a large degree of heterogeneity in response to Perifosine. Prolonged
treatment with Perifosine (70 population doublings) led to further telomere shortening in Hela cells, while not accelerating shortening
in BJ cells B., indicating that long-term treatment with Perifosine could result in continuous telomere shortening. Perifosine treatment
had variable effects on telomerase enzymatic activity C., measured as number of telomerase extension products per cell input, though
changes in enzymatic activity were not always consistent with changes in telomere length. Continuous long-term treatment with Perifosine
interfered with colony formation and growth in soft agar D., suggesting that it may be a viable anti-telomerase therapy.

the reduced telomerase activity measured. To test if the
shortest telomeres in the population were getting shorter,
we performed universal Single TElomere Length Analysis
(Uni-STELA) in order to quantify the length and dynamics
of the shortest telomeres in these samples.
There was a significant reduction in total UniSTELA product length in patient 5, while there was no
change in patient 11 (Figure 4A and 4B). However, there
was a reduction in the mean length of the shortest quartile
of Uni-STELA products in both patients, indicating that
the shortest telomeres were indeed becoming shorter
(Figure 4C). This is important since it is the shortest
telomeres that will result in inhibition of cell growth or
induction of apoptosis [25].

(Figure 3B).

Universal STELA measurement of the shortest
telomeres in Perifosine-treated CLL samples
CLL is composed of varying proportions of
proliferative cells depending on a number of poorlyunderstood factors; for most patients, the majority of
the tumor is both non-proliferative and telomerase
negative, though periodic reversion to a telomerase
positive proliferative state is believed to occur [24]. Due
to this slow turnover, it is possible that quantities of time

treated primary tumors were smaller on average compared to control tumors A. However, neither recurrent primary tumor nor metastatic
tumor load were significantly reduced by Perifosine treatment B. Telomere length in treated recurrent primary and metastatic tumors was
significantly shorter in treated mice C., though there was not a significant difference between control and treated tumors of any type.

Discussion

c-circle abundance roughly equal to SW13, a cell line
known to utilize ALT (Figure S6), suggesting that in this
case a telomerase-dependent telomere shortening effect of
Perifosine may have been prevented because HCC4017
uses ALT to maintain telomeres. Furthermore, Perifosine
may impact telomere length through multiple mechanisms
due to the heterogeneity in response in cell lines in
vitro and that a number of cell lines exhibited telomere
shortening with continuous Perifosine treatment without a
reduction in telomerase activity.
Inhibition of telomerase activity occurred in some
lines that exhibited telomere shortening in response to
Perifosine, though a change in telomerase activity did not

This work has shown that Perifosine, an AKT
inhibitor, can prevent telomere maintenance in vitro, in
xenograft models and in CLL patients continuously treated
with Perifosine. Perifosine did not increase the normal
rate of telomere length reduction in telomerase negative
cells, indicating that the reduction in telomere length was
telomerase-dependent in cancer cells. HCC4017 did not
have telomere shortening in response to Perifosine, and
because of its very low baseline activity we evaluated
it for the presence of c-circles, a marker for Alternative
Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) [26]. HCC4017 had

universally predict an alteration in telomere length. Both
H2009 and H1819 exhibited telomere shortening without a
reduction in telomerase activity, suggesting that Perifosine
may impair telomere maintenance in some backgrounds
in a telomerase enzymatic activity independent manner,
such as by regulating telomerase nuclear localization.
AKT may modulate telomerase activity through a number
of mechanisms, and Perifosine impacts pathways other
than AKT, such as the p38 pathway [27], which may help
explain some of the varying telomere biological responses

to the drug. It is possible that Perifosine’s other activities
may be responsible for the observed telomere shortening.
We found that sub-lethal concentrations of the AKT
inhibitor IV also resulted in telomere shortening over time,
though cells treated with AKT inhibitor I and the Dual
Pathway Inhibitor (two other small molecules reported to
inhibit AKT) did not exhibit telomere shortening in a pilot
series of experiments (Figure S5), suggesting that AKTindependent activities of the drugs in question may be
responsible for the effects on telomerase.

Somatic telomerase activity in mouse cells
coupled with the fact that laboratory mouse telomeres
are an order of magnitude larger than human telomeres
[28] have complicated pre-clinical evaluation of
telomerase inhibitors in the past. In this study, we mostly
circumvented the problem of mouse cell contamination
of tumor samples through brief tissue culture and the
induction of mouse cell death with puromycin treatment
since the human tumor cell line was puromycin resistant.
Because telomere length predominantly changes during
cell division, short periods of time in tissue culture are
unlikely to alter telomere length, though small changes
as a result of 1-4 population doublings in tissue culture
may have occurred. A recent study [17] measured telomere
length in xenografts treated with Imetelstat without
removing mouse cells, and it is possible that their telomere
length data could have been biased by mouse telomere
contamination. Indeed, the band present above the 18.8
kilobase ladder band in the non-tumor-bearing mouse
lung tissue sample in Figure S2 appears in all xenograft
samples in that study, and optimization experiments
conducted prior to this work indicate that the presence
of 20% by mass mouse contamination of a human DNA
sample is sufficient to produce a dramatically biased
measurement of telomere length (Figure S3). Improved
methods to distinguish between murine and human
telomeres in xenograft samples such as that presented
here should improve understanding of telomere biology in
more physiological contexts in the future.
Though there was a difference between primary,
recurrent primary and metastatic tumor telomere length
within the treated group in the xenograft model, there
was not a significant difference in mean telomere length
between control tumors and treated tumors, indicating
that Perifosine was not sufficient to induce dramatic
telomere shortening in this xenograft model during the
relatively short treatment period. It is possible that the
mouse microenvironment included some stimulus that
antagonized the function of Perifosine, such as estrogen
or normoxia, both of which have been associated with
increased telomerase activity [29, 30]. It is also possible
that the observed small differences in telomere length
between tumor sites are the result of founder effects from
the parent population, though this seems unlikely because
telomere length in the primary tumors was longer than
subclones of the parental HCC38+GFP+Luc cell line in
vitro (Figure S1). It remains possible that cells with short
telomeres in the cell population may have dropped out
during the treatment in vivo resulting in a survivorship
advantage to cells with longer telomeres.
This is the first study of a telomerase inhibitor used
in the clinic to evaluate changes in telomere length over the
course of treatment. Telomere length is a vital biomarker
of the efficacy of treatment with a telomerase inhibitor,
since the aim of anti-telomerase therapy is to impose a
replicative limit on tumors through progressive telomere
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

shortening leading to apoptosis. Changes in mean telomere
length were modest, 300-400bp reduction in length of
the shortest quartile, in response to Perifosine. It is also
possible that clonal evolution within the tumor sample
may be partially responsible for the effect observed, and
follow-up studies that monitor STELA product length
in CLL samples treated with drugs that do not modify
telomere length will be required to rule out a clonal
evolution event as the cause. The number of samples
available from this trial was small, and we were unable
to rule out possible confounding effects from factors such
as lifestyle changes that can result in changes in telomere
length [31, 32]. Treatment beginning earlier in the course
of the disease and continuing for longer periods of time
would be predicted to cause further reduction in telomere
length, which is viable given Perifosine’s generally
mild toxicity profile at the doses used. Shortening of the
shortest telomeres is the most important indicator of a
replicative limit [25], and the reduction in length in the
shortest quartile of telomeres observed in these patients
is encouraging. It is possible that Perifosine provided in a
setting of minimal residual disease may prevent relapses
in specific subsets of patients by imposing a limit on
replication.
The reduction in telomerase enzymatic activity
demonstrated in purified tumor samples from Perifosinetreated CLL patients, coupled with the observation of a
reduction in the length of the shortest telomeres indicates
that Perifosine may be a viable anti-telomerase therapy.
Interestingly, mild thrombocytopenia and leukopenia
were observed in the clinical trials of Perifosine. These
toxicities are the same as those observed with another
telomerase inhibitor, Imetelstat [33]. In the genetic
disorders of impaired telomere maintenance such as
Dyskeratosis Congenita [34] similar clinical presentations
have been observed. It is possible that this overlap may
be due to “on target” effects of the drugs via dysregulated
hematopoietic stem cell maintenance via telomerase
inhibition, rather than specific idiosyncrasies of the drugs
themselves.
One other study has examined telomerase activity
in human patients treated with the telomerase inhibitor,
Imetelstat, in PBMCs of pediatric solid tumor patients
[33]. They observed a decrease in telomerase activity,
albeit with a high degree of heterogeneity. Telomerase
enzymatic activity in the tumor or PBMCs is a
mechanistically relevant biomarker of the efficacy of antitelomerase therapy that should be examined in greater
detail in future studies of telomerase inhibitors.
Perifosine can inhibit telomerase activity in vitro
heterogeneously depending on a number of factors yet to
be discovered, and this telomerase inhibition can be used
to limit cell growth. In summary, long-term treatment with
Perifosine induced the shortest quartile of telomeres to
shorten in both CLL patients treated in excess of 4 months
and inhibited telomerase activity in 4 of 6 patients within

measured by luciferase activity. Tumor samples were
disassociated and cultured for telomere analysis at primary
removal in week 6 as well as from both recurrent primary
and lung metastatic tumors in week 12. All xenograft
experiments were conducted under UT Southwestern
IACUC approval.
The treated group was given an initial loading dose
of 62.6 mg/kg Perifosine suspended in sterile PBS by oral
gavage in the first week of treatment followed by weekly
maintenance doses of 35.8 mg/kg Perifosine which are
reported to maintain Perifosine blood concentrations
between 12 uM immediately following a dose and 5 uM
immediately prior to a dose based on previous studies on
Perifosine pharmacokinetics in mice [36].

8 days of initial treatment. Overall these results suggest
Perifosine may be useful as an anti-telomerase therapy.

materials and Methods
Cell culture and in vitro drug treatment
All cells were cultured at 37° C in 5% CO2, in
Media X (HyClone, Logan UT) with the addition of 10%
calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of Perifosine with
media changes and fresh Perifosine added every 3 days;
cells were passaged 1:32 when they approached 100%
confluence.
The other AKT inhibitors, AKT inhibitor I, AKT
inhibitor IV, and the PDK1/AKT/Flt Dual Pathway
Inhibitor (EMD4 Biosciences), were tested under the
same conditions as Perifosine using the concentrations
indicated, replaced every three days.
HCC38 cells expressing a Luciferase (HCC38
+ Luc) construct were obtained from the Brekken lab
(UT Southwestern). HCC38 + Luc cells were infected
with a lentiviral vector bearing an empty pGipZ plasmid
containing GFP and puromycin resistance genes
(HCC38+Luc+GFP).

Explant culture
Following surgical excision, tumor samples were
placed into 750 uL of Gibco Minimum Essential Media
(MEM; Life Technologies) on ice and transported to the
tissue culture facility. Tumor samples were then chopped
into small pieces with autoclaved surgical scissors and
resuspended in 750 uL MEM containing 0.5 mg/mL
Liberase DL research grade (Roche). Tissue was incubated
at 37° C for 60 minutes under agitation at 225 RPM.
Fragments were further dissociated by repeat pipetting
through 10, 5, and 1mL pipettes (5x each), and then
filtered through a 200 micrometer nylon mesh. Samples
were centrifuged at 1500 x g for 5 minutes, and then
resuspended in 10mL Media X + 10% fetal calf serum
+ 5 ug/mL puromycin and plated into 10cm dishes for
cell culture to remove mouse cells. Fresh Media X + 10%
fetal calf serum + 5ug/mL puromycin was replaced 3 days
following cell culture to remove dead cells. On day 7 of
puromycin selection (to remove mouse contaminating
cells), culture dishes were washed 2x with 10 mL
phosphate buffered saline, and then harvested for TRF
analysis by trypsinization (5 minutes).

Soft agar colony formation assay
The soft agar colony formation was performed as
in [35] with a number of modifications. The assay was
performed in triplicate in 12-well plates, at a density of
1500 cells per well. In addition to the two agar layers,
0.5mL Media X +10% calf serum was added either with
the addition of 1.84uM Perifosine (long-term treated
and transiently treated cells) or without the addition of
Perifosine (control cells). Cells were allowed to grow
under these conditions for four weeks, replacing the media
with fresh media every three days. At the conclusion
of week 4, colonies were imaged and counted with the
ImageJ analysis software.

Surgical procedure
For orthotopic mammary fat pad xenograft
injections, mice were anesthetized with 2% continuous
isoflurane and the area of the incision was thoroughly
cleaned with 70% ethanol and betadine. A small incision
was made over the right axillary fat pad and 3x106
HCC+Luc+GFP cells suspended in 50uL autoclaved
PBS+EDTA were injected into the fat pad using a
30-gauge needle. The incision was closed with wound
clips, and mice were placed in a recovery cage on a
heating pad. Mice were given 0.1mg/kg intraperitoneal
buprenorphine analgesia following breathing stabilization
postoperatively and 24 hours later. All surgical instruments
were autoclaved prior to operating and a hot bead sterilizer

Xenograft design
The second mammary fat pads of 30 (15 control and
15 treated) 6-8 week old female NOD/SCID IL2G mice
(obtained from an on-campus supplier) were injected
with 3*10^6 HCC38 breast cancer cells, and tumors
were allowed to grow for 2 weeks before Perifosine was
administered to the treated group. Primary tumors were
measured once weekly in weeks 4 to 6 by digital calipers.
Primary tumors were removed after measurement in week
6. Bioluminescent measurements of recurrent primary
tumor burden were obtained in week 12. The mice were

The primary tumors were removed using the same
anesthesia and pre-surgical conditions as the xenograft
injection procedure. A small incision was made in the skin
directly overlying the tumor, and the skin/subcutaneous
tissue surrounding the tumor was carefully dissected
free from the tumor surface circumferentially using
both blunt and sharp dissection. The entire macroscopic
primary tumor was removed when possible; however
in cases where the primary tumor was involving
surrounding structures (brachial artery, chest wall or
forelimb musculature) a small amount of tumor was left
in situ. Incisions were closed with wound clips, and mice
were placed in a recovery cage on a heating pad, given
buprenorphine analgesia, and monitored until ambulatory.

Universal STELA data was quantified using the
manufacturer’s software (GeneSnap) for the Syngene
G-Box (Syngene, MD), using the quantitative methods
for determining the molecular weight of western blot data.
The TRF ladders run on the gel were used to establish
areas of known molecular weight, and the molecular
weight of each STELA product was established from the
ladders as determined by the software. The automated
band identification algorithm provided with the software
was used to identify peaks, with minimal human curation
to remove obvious errors (e.g. two signals for one band,
clearly misidentified bands).

Bioluminescence imaging

CLL samples (10 million cells/pellet) were purified
as part of the previous IRB approved clinical study at
Duke University Medical Center [23]. Patients in that
study were treated with 50 mg twice daily oral Perifosine
for up to six months. Unused samples from the human
clinical trial protocol were used for these experiments.

Human samples

40 mg/mL D Luciferin (Gold Biotech, MO)
suspended in autoclaved PBS was injected subcutaneously
in mice anesthetized with 2% continuous isoflurane. Mice
were placed on a heated imaging stage for ten minutes,
and then imaged using the IVIS Lumina imaging system
(Perkin Elmer, MA). Luciferase signals were quantified
using the manufacturer’s software. Mice were sacrificed
immediately following acquisition of the recurrent primary
tumor image in week 12; lungs were removed and imaged
under the same conditions.

Statistical analysis
Two-sided t-tests performed with Graphpad Prism 7
software were used to compare group means.

was performed as in [39], with the exception that a prelengthened, pre-annealed form of the panhandle primer
pair was used in order to omit the fill-in step. Panhandle
oligos were pre-annealed by heating at 95ºC for 5 minutes,
followed by cooling to 25ºC at a rate of 1ºC per minute
in New England Biolabs buffer 2 (New England Biolabs,
MA). The sequence of the 42-mer panhandle primer
was 5’-TGTAGCTGAAGACGACAGAAAGGGCGT
GGTGCGGACGCGGG-3’, and the 44-mer was
5’-TACCCGCGTCCGCACCACGCCCTTTCTGT
CGTCTTCACGCTACA-3’.
