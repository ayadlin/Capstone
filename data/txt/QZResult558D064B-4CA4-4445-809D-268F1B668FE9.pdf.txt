ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin is the chemotherapeutic drug of choice for a wide variety of cancers,
and cardiotoxicity is one of the major side effects of doxorubicin treatment. One of
the main cellular targets of doxorubicin in the heart is mitochondria. Mitochondrial
sirtuin, SIRT3 has been shown to protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
We have recently identified honokiol (HKL) as an activator of SIRT3, which protects
the heart from developing pressure overload hypertrophy. Here, we show that HKLmediated activation of SIRT3 also protects the heart from doxorubicin-induced
cardiac damage without compromising the tumor killing potential of doxorubicin.
Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with increased ROS production and
consequent fragmentation of mitochondria and cell death. HKL-mediated activation
of SIRT3 prevented Doxorubicin induced ROS production, mitochondrial damage
and cell death in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. HKL also promoted mitochondrial
fusion. We also show that treatment with HKL blocked doxorubicin-induced cardiac
toxicity in mice. This was associated with reduced mitochondrial DNA damage and
improved mitochondrial function. Furthermore, treatments of mice, bearing prostrate
tumor-xenografts, with HKL and doxorubicin showed inhibition of tumor growth
with significantly reduced cardiac toxicity. Our results suggest that HKL-mediated
activation of SIRT3 protects the heart from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and
represents a potentially novel adjunct for chemotherapy treatments.

INTRODUCTION

Several molecular targets of HKL have been identified,
these include NF-kb, STAT3, epidermal growth factor
receptor, m-TOR, beta catenin and HIF1α [2]. Activities of
all these enzymes are crucial for cell survival, proliferation
and metabolism. Coincidently, SIRT3 also has a profound
effect on regulating activity of these enzymes leading to
the discovery that HKL is also an activator of SIRT3 [1113].
SIRT3 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase localized
primarily in mitochondria, and the only deacetylase
in mitochondria that has robust deacetylase activity.
A mass spectroscopic study revealed that nearly 65%
of mitochondrial proteins were acetylated implying

Honokiol (HKL) is a small molecular weight
polyphenol derived from the tree, magnolia [1]. HKL’s
anti-cancer activity has been studied extensively [2].
HKL was found be effective in several animal models
of cancer including lung, prostate, breast, colon and
pancreatic cancers [3-7]. Besides its cytotoxicity in cancer,
HKL was reported to induce variety of cytoprotective
activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic,
anti-arrhythmic, neuroprotective, anti-oxidative, and antihypertrophic effects [1, 8-10]. Thus, HKL has the potential
to act both as an antitumor and cytoprotective molecule.

a crucial role of Sirt3 in mitochondria [14]. SIRT3
maintains mitochondrial health by deacetylating a
wide variety of enzymes involved in metabolism, ROS
production, apoptosis and mitochondrial dynamics
[15]. In the heart, mitochondrial protein lysine hyperacetylation was found to be associated with induction
of heart failure, and overexpression of SIRT3 protected
hearts against hypertrophic stimuli [16]. Consistent
with this, Sirt3.KO mice develop cardiac hypertrophy
spontaneously [17]. SIRT3 has been shown to augment
Foxo3a mediated anti-oxidant defense mechanisms
[17]. Several other mechanisms are also attributed to
SIRT3-mediated cardioprotection. SIRT3 suppresses the
activity of cyclophilin D, thereby blocking mitochondrial
permeability transition pore opening [18]. SIRT3 can also
block cardiac hypertrophy by augmenting the activity of
LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK [13]. Furthermore,
lipid accumulation-induced cardiac hypertrophy was
mitigated by SIRT3 mediated deacetylation of long chain
acyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) [19].
SIRT3 also acts as a tumor suppressor [20]. Loss
of SIRT3 results in increased ROS production, resulting
in HIF1α stabilization, followed by transcriptional
induction of various cancer promoting genes and a shift
in metabolism towards glycolysis (Warburg effect).
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) overexpressing
Myc/Ras developed into tumors when implanted in the
hind limb of mice, whereas mice implanted with SIRT3+/+
Myc/Ras, SIRT3−/− Myc, or SIRT3−/− Ras MEFs did not,
thus asserting tumor suppressor activity of SIRT3 [11].
The tumor suppressor role of SIRT3 in breast, colon,
osteosarcoma and prostate cancer cells have been also
reported [21]. Correspondingly, a recent study reported
that HKL treatment by increasing the expression of
SIRT3, attenuated palmitate induced decrease in SDH
activity in LX2 cells [22]. These cells also showed
reduced GPR91 and alpha SMA protein expression,
markers of the fibrogenic response [22]. Similarly, we
have recently reported that HKL treatment increases the
activity of SIRT3 [10]. HKL not only blocked the pressure
overload-mediated cardiac hypertrophic response, but also
ameliorated pre-existing cardiac hypertrophy in mice.
Additionally, HKL-treatment blocked cardiac fibroblast
proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts in a
SIRT3-dependent manner [10]. These findings suggested
that whole body SIRT3 activation might concurrently
reduce tumor progression while preventing the cardiac
hypertrophic response.
Suppression of tumor growth, without damaging
the heart, is an enigma researchers have been facing
since the introduction of chemotherapy. Doxorubicin
(Doxo) is a chemotherapeutic drug of choice for a wide
variety of cancer types [23]. Optimal use of doxorubicin
is limited by its cardiotoxicity [24]. Several mechanisms
have been postulated to explain the cardiotoxic effects of
doxorubicin. Even though oxidative stress is established
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as a primary cause of doxorubicin toxicity, interventions
targeted to reduce oxidative stress have been found to be
ineffective [25, 26]. Several oxidative stress independent
mechanisms have also been proposed for doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity. In hearts, doxorubicin can form
a ternary complex with topoisomerase II (Top2b) beta
and DNA, inducing DNA double strand break and
resultant cell death. Correspondingly, cardiomyocytespecific deletion of Top2b has been shown to protect
mice from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity [27].
Another mechanism widely implicated in doxorubicin
toxicity is the interaction of doxorubicin with iron, which
generates substantial amount of ROS by several different
mechanisms. Accordingly, overexpression of ABCB8,
a protein that facilitates iron export from mitochondria,
was shown to protect the heart from doxorubicin-induced
cardiomyopathy in mice [28].
Apart from its acute toxicity, doxorubicin-induced
cardiomyopathy may develop after years of latency, and
these hypotheses are inadequate in explaining the etiology
of chronic doxorubicin toxicity. Recently, our group and
others have shown that activation of SIRT3 can protect
the heart from doxorubicin-induced toxicity [29-31]. In
cardiomyocytes doxorubicin preferentially accumulates
in mitochondria and doxorubicin-induced cellular toxicity
is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction; hence
mitochondria-mediated mechanisms posit a potential
etiology for the onset of delayed cardiotoxicity [28].
Childhood mitochondrial diseases are associated with
progressive neurological, cardiac and liver dysfunction,
whereas adult onset mitochondrial diseases manifest as
a progressive multisystem disorders [32]. Mitochondrial
DNA mutations are the primary cause for many
mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial DNA is more
vulnerable to damage and have more than 10-17 fold
increased mutation rate than nuclear DNA [33]. One of
the major DNA repair enzymes in mitochondria is OGG1.
Decreased OGG1 expression in mitochondria is associated
with mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatoma cells and
tissues [34]. Cardiac overexpression of OGG1 protected
mitochondrial DNA and reduced fibrosis following transaortic constriction, implying a critical role of OGG1 in
blocking mitochondrial DNA damage [35]. Mitochondrial
DNA damage is often associated with oxidation of
guanosine nucleotide and accumulation of 8-oxo-dG
adducts (7-8-dihydro-8-oxo-2 deoxyguanosine). OGG1
hydrolyses 8-oxo-dG adducts from the DNA and the
presence of elevated 8-oxo-dG adducts in DNA represents
deficiency in OGG1 activity [36]. Another mechanism
that helps cells to maintain mitochondrial health and DNA
integrity is mitochondrial fusion which enables the mixing
of mitochondrial contents [37]. Content mixing enables the
human cells to tolerate high levels of pathogenic mtDNA
damage [38]. The major proteins involved in regulating
the mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics, includes DRP1
which promotes mitochondrial fission, whereas fusion

events are regulated by two mitofusins, MFN1 and MFN2,
which are responsible for fusion of outer mitochondrial
membranes, and OPA1, which is involved in the fusion of
inner mitochondrial membranes [37]. Recently, we found
that over-expression of SIRT3 protects the heart from
doxorubicin-induced toxicity while activating OPA1 to
enhance mitochondrial fusion [31].
In this study, we report that HKL can protect
cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced cell death.
We also demonstrate that HKL can block doxorubicininduced cardiac hypertrophic response in mice without
compromising the tumor killing potential of doxorubicin.
Correspondingly, HKL attenuates pathologic cardiac
hypertrophy and fibrosis by activating SIRT3.

We have previously shown that doxorubicin induces
downregulation of SIRT3 and acetylation of mitochondrial
proteins [29]. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with Doxo
promotes ROS production, which can be alleviated by
SIRT3 activation [29]. To test if HKL can effectively
impede the Doxo-induced ROS production, cultures of
cardiomyocytes were treated with Doxo in the presence
or absence of HKL for 24 hours. Cells were stained with
CM-H2DCFDA a non-fluorescent dye that fluoresces upon

oxidation by ROS. We found that cells treated with HKL
suppressed doxorubicin-induced ROS levels (Figure 1A
and 1B). To support these findings, we performed the
cell death experiments. Consistent with our ROS results,
HKL treatment helped to rescue cardiomyocytes from
doxorubicin-induced cell death (Figure 1C and 1D). To
confirm these findings, we analyzed the mitochondrial
membrane potential of doxorubicin treated cardiomyocytes
in the absence or presence of HKL. TMRM is a cell
permeant dye, which fluoresces when accumulated in
the negatively charged polarized mitochondria of healthy
cells. Doxorubicin treated cardiomyocytes showed reduced
TMRM uptake, whereas pre-treatment with HKL rescued
the TMRM uptake in doxorubicin treated cardiomyocytes,
suggesting that HKL protects cardiomyocytes from Doxoinduced mitochondrial damage (Figure 2A and 2B).
Mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics plays a
critical role in maintaining mitochondrial health when cells
are exposed to various stresses [39]. Mitochondrial fusion
helps to alleviate stress by mixing contents of partially
damaged mitochondria. SIRT3 activation promotes
mitochondrial fusion, whereas, doxorubicin is known to
induce mitochondrial fragmentation [31]. We therefore
tested if HKL treatment can alleviate doxorubicin-induced
toxicity by promoting mitochondrial fusion. Rat neonatal
cardiomyocytes were overexpressed with Ad.Mito-GFP
followed by treatment with 5µM doxorubicin for 24hr,
and mitochondrial morphology was monitored by confocal
microscopy. Doxorubicin treatment caused mitochondrial
fragmentation, whereas treatment with HKL preserved
the normal tubular shape of mitochondria, suggesting that

HKL promotes mitochondrial fusion (Figure 3A and 3B).
We also found reduced levels of MFN1 and OPA1, two
fusion proteins involved in the fusion of outer and inner
mitochondrial membranes, respectively. Pre-treatment
with HKL helped to maintain SIRT3 as well as OPA
and MFN-1 levels of cells exposed to doxorubicin. We
also observed increased levels of mitochondrial fission
protein, DRP1 in doxorubicin exposed cells, which was
suppressed by HKL treatment (Figure 3C Supplementary
Figure 1) [40]. SIRT3-mediated deacetylation at K-122
has been shown to increase enzymatic activity of MnSOD.
Correspondingly, increased acetylation of MnSOD is
correlated with loss of SIRT3 activity [41]. Consistent
with this, we found increased activity of SIRT3 in Doxo
plus HKL treated cells as revealed by decreased MnSOD
acetylation (Figure 3C, Supplementary Figure 1). These
results suggest that HKL mitigates mitochondrial damage
by activating SIRT3 and promoting mitochondrial fusion.

HKL protects mice from doxorubicin-induced
cardiac hypertrophy
Our in vitro data showed that HKL has cardioprotective effects against doxorubicin toxicity. To test this
in vivo, mice were treated with three doses of doxorubicin
(5mg/kg) at fifteen-day interval, and the control mice
received vehicle injection. In the treatment group, HKL
administration (0.2mg/kg/day) was started the day before
doxorubicin infusion, and was maintained throughout the
course of the study. In a previous study, this dose of HKL

was found sufficient to protect mice from developing the
TAC induced cardiac hypertrophic response [10]. Cardiac
functions of mice were assessed 15 days after the last dose
of Doxo. Doxorubicin injection resulted in 25% increase
in heart weight/tibia length (HW/TL) ratio, whereas
HKL treated mice showed no noticeable increase as
compared to control (Figure 4A). Additionally, mice that
received doxorubicin plus HKL showed preserved cardiac
function, compared to doxorubicin and vehicle treated
mice (Figure 4B). Consistent with this, doxorubicin plus
HKL treated mice also showed significantly reduced
fibrosis and reduced activation of fetal gene program as
compared to doxorubicin alone treated group (Figure 4C,
D and E). Electron microscopic examination of the heart
sections revealed increased mitochondrial derangement
and loss of myofibrils in doxorubicin treated group, as
compared to the doxorubicin plus HKL treated group

(Figure 4F). Cardiomyocytes death due to apoptosis
and necrosis are considered as one of the main factors
leading to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity [42].
Hence we measured the apoptosis of myocytes using in
situ terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay.
Doxorubicin treated mice showed significantly increased
TUNEL positive cells, compared to mice receiving HKL
together with Doxo (Figure 5A, 5B), suggesting that
similar to our in vitro results, HKL was capable to block
cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo. Bcl-2 is a mitochondrion
associated anti-apoptotic protein, which helps to sequester
pro-apoptotic proteins to inhibit their function [43]. We
therefore examined the expression of Bcl-2 in heart lysates
of different treatment groups of mice. In accordance with
TUNEL assay, Bcl-2 levels were markedly reduced in
mice treated with doxorubicin, compared to mice treated
with Doxo together with HKL (Figure 5C, 5D), suggesting

that HKL might also protect mitochondrial DNA from
doxorubicin induced damage. Intact mitochondrial DNA
has the ability to support PCR amplification, whereas
damaged DNA strand results in non-amplification of DNA.
By utilizing this principle, we tested the effect of HKL on
doxorubicin induced mtDNA damage in cardiomyocytes,

mitochondrial DNA lesions (Figure 6A). Increased DNA
damage is also associated with increased levels of 8-oxodG adducts. To gain further evidence for this, we assessed
the 8-oxo-dG levels in the DNA of doxorubicin or
doxorubicin plus HKL treated cells. We observed reduced
8-oxo-dG levels in doxorubicin plus HKL treated cells,
compared to doxorubicin alone treated cells, suggesting
that HKL can protect cardiomyocytes from doxorubicininduced mitochondrial DNA damage (Figure 6B).
We have previously shown that doxorubicin
downregulates SIRT3 in mouse hearts with concomitant
reduction in OGG1 levels [29]. Here, we tested if
HKL treatment helps to maintain SIRT3 levels and
activity in doxorubicin treated mice hearts (Figure 7A,
Supplementary Figure 2). Consistent with our previous
findings, we found reduced SIRT3 and OGG1 levels
in doxorubicin treated mice hearts, whereas treatment
with HKL helped to maintain both SIRT3 and OGG1
levels. We also found increased MnSOD acetylation
in doxorubicin treated mouse hearts, which was again
blocked in hearts treated with HKL, suggesting that
HKL helped to maintain the SIRT3 activity following
doxorubicin treatment (Figure 7A, Supplementary Figure
2). Consistent with the in vitro results, we also found
increased expression of MFN1 and OPA1 in Doxo plus
HKL treated hearts, compared to doxorubicin alone treated
mice, thus showing the evidence for the ability of HKL
to maintain the mitochondrial fusion dynamics (Figure
7A, Supplementary Figure 2). In agreement with this,
we found that mice infused with doxorubicin, but treated
with HKL showed reduced mitochondrial DNA damage
and reduced accumulation of 8-oxo-dG, compared to mice
infused with doxorubicin alone, suggesting that HKL has
the potential to avert doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial
DNA damage in mice (Figure 7B and 7C). Citrate
synthase is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the first
step of TCA cycle. It catalyzes the condensation of acetate
and oxaloacetate to form citrate, and hence a key marker
for mitochondrial function. Doxorubicin treatment caused
significant reduction in citrate synthase activity, whereas
HKL treatment improved the activity of enzyme in
doxorubicin treated mice (Figure 7D). We also measured
ATP levels in these hearts, and found that, ATP levels were
reduced by nearly 30% in Doxo-infused hearts, whereas
they were generally maintained at control levels in HKL
treated hearts (Figure 7E). Together, these results suggest
that HKL mitigates Doxo-induced mtDNA damage and
improves the mitochondrial function.

subcutaneously in the flank of nude mice. Mice received
first dose of doxorubicin seven days after tumor cell
implantation. Two more doses of doxorubicin were
given at 15-day intervals. HKL treatment was started
one day before doxorubicin infusion. Mice treated with
doxorubicin showed significant reduction in tumor volume
as compared to controls. Similar reduction in tumor
volume was observed in mice that were concomitantly
treated with doxorubicin and HKL (Figure 8A and 8B).
Similar to our earlier results, doxorubicin induced cardiac
hypertrophy associated with reduced cardiac functions, but
not when mice were treated with HKL during doxorubicin
infusion (Figure 8C and 8D). Furthermore, doxorubicin
plus HKL treatment also reduced cardiac fibrosis,
suggesting that HKL can effectively block doxorubicininduced cardiac hypertrophy without compromising the
tumor killing potential of doxorubicin (Figure 8E and 8F).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report that HKL, an activator of
SIRT3 can mitigate doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy
in mice. Doxorubicin treatment downregulated SIRT3,
leading to increased ROS levels and mitochondrial
DNA damage. HKL mitigated Doxo-induced cardiac
injury by activating SIRT3 and reducing cell death. This
was associated with increased mitochondrial fusion
and reduced mtDNA damage. We also found that HKL
could protect the heart from doxorubicin toxicity without
compromising the chemotherapeutic efficacy of the latter.
Together, our studies reveal that HKL is a potent negative
regulator of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Activation of sirtuins is known to protect the heart
from doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity [29-31, 45].
Among seven isoforms of the sirtuin family, SIRT3 is the
major deacetylase present in mitochondria [46]. Sirt3-KO
mice exhibit global hyper-acetylation of mitochondrial
proteins, and accordingly, several disease models show
deficiency of SIRT3. SIRT3 is downregulated in the
muscles of diabetic mice, in the hearts of high fat diet
fed mice as well as in the blood vessels of obese mice
[47-49]. Moreover, in humans a SIRT3-polymorphism
with loss of function is associated with pulmonary arterial
hypertension and propensity to develop diabetes [50-52].
Consequently, reduced SIRT3 levels are reported in several
models of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure [10, 29].
Consistent with our previous results, we observed reduced
SIRT3 levels in Doxo treated mouse hearts [29]. We have
also previously shown that HKL physically binds to and
augments the activity of SIRT3 [10]. In accordance with
that, in the present study, we found that HKL treatment
reversed the Doxo-induced hyper-acetylation of MnSOD.
SIRT3 deficiency is associated with increased
ROS production which is detrimental to the cell [53].
Several factors could account for this effect of SIRT3.
SIRT3 can directly deacetylate and activate MnSOD, an

enzyme that is involved in the conversion of superoxide
to hydrogen peroxide [41]. Further, SIRT3 can contain
ROS levels by deacetylating and activating isocitrate
dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2), an enzyme that consumes
NADPH, thus providing NADPH to convert oxidized
glutathione to glutathione, a major intracellular
antioxidant [54]. In addition to this, SIRT3 negatively
regulates ROS production by deacetylating and activating
several components of the electron transport chain,
which are believed to be responsible for 90% of the ROS
production in mitochondria [55]. In accordance with these
observations, we found that doxorubicin-induced cellular
ROS was mitigated by the SIRT3 activator HKL.
Excessive ROS production is associated with
oxidation of cellular macromolecules leading to cell death.
SIRT3 can block cardiomyocyte apoptosis by activating
many different defense mechanisms. Translocation of
the protein Bax into the mitochondria causes apoptosis.
Deacetylation of Ku70 by SIRT3 augments its interaction
with the pro-apoptotic Bax and prevents its translocation
to mitochondria [56]. Another process that influences
apoptosis is mitochondrial dynamics. Constant
mitochondrial fusion and fission permits the exchange
of mitochondrial contents and Ca2+ signal transmission
[39]. Hence, dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics
is detrimental to the cell. DRP1 is a master regulator of
mitochondrial fission, and over activation of DRP1 is
associated with mitochondrial fragmentation and cell

death [57]. In contrast, MFN1 and OPA1 are proteins
involved in outer and inner mitochondrial membrane
fusion, respectively. SIRT3 mediated activation of OPA1
has been shown to protect cardiomyocyte from cell death
[31]. In agreement with these findings, we found that
doxorubicin treatment reduced protein levels of OPA1
and MFN1, while increasing the expression of DRP1.
HKL treatment helped to maintain these protein levels at
normal levels suggesting that HKL can improve the health
of mitochondria by promoting mitochondrial fusion.
Correspondingly, overexpression of SIRT3 also protects
cardiomyocytes from Doxo-induced cell death [29].
Consistent with these observations, in this study, here we
found that treatment with HKL efficiently blocks Doxoinduced cardiomyocyte cell death.
SIRT3 is a well-established anti-hypertrophic
molecule. Deficiency of SIRT3 is associated with
increased susceptibility to develop cardiac hypertrophy
[17]. We have previously shown that Sirt3.Tg mice
are resistant to develop agonist-induced as well as
doxorubicin-mediated cardiac hypertrophy [17]. Further,
HKL can block and reverse cardiac hypertrophic response
in mice [10]. Consistent with these reports, in the
present study we found that HKL could effectively block
doxorubicin-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction.
We have also shown previously that SIRT3 is a negative

Figure 9: A model illustrating how HKL protects the heart from doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury: Doxorubicintreatment downregulates SIRT3 in the heart resulting in decreased levels of OGG1, MFN1 and OPA1, and increased
levels of ROS in mitochondria, all contributing to mtDNA damage. Doxorubicin can also cause mtDNA damage by directly

binding to DNA. Activation of Sirt3 by HKL augments OGG1, MFN1 and OPA1 and reduces ROS production, thereby mitigating mtDNA
damage by decreasing the oxidative damage as well by increasing the efficiency of DNA repair and mitochondrial fusion dynamics. These
changes promote overall health of mitochondria, and thereby protecting cardiac myocytes from death and development of cardiac failure.

the heart with age [12]. HKL treatment has the potential
to block proliferation of fibroblasts and their transition to
myofibroblasts. Consistent with these observations we
found reduced cardiac fibrosis in doxorubicin-induced
mice treated with HKL. These results suggest that HKL
can effectively block development of cardiac hypertrophy
and fibrosis in response to the Doxo therapy.
Mitochondria contribute to more than 90% of
the ROS generated in cells having high respiratory
rates like cardiomyocytes [58]. Mitochondrial DNA,
because of its proximity to the source of ROS is highly
vulnerable to damage. It is also reported that damages to
mitochondrial DNA are more extensive and persist longer
than nuclear DNA damage following oxidative stress [59].
Mitochondrial DNA also has a 10-17 fold higher mutation
rate, compared to nuclear DNA [33]. Doxorubicininduced mitochondrial superoxide production can cause
damage to mitochondrial DNA [28, 60]. One of the
most abundant products of DNA nucleotide damage is
synthesis of 7-8-dihydro-8-oxo-2 deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) [61]. We have previously shown that doxorubicin
treatment is associated with increased mtDNA damage
and accumulation of 8-oxo-dG [29]. Accumulation of
8-oxo-dG is correlated with reduced levels of OGG1,
a mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme. Over expression
of SIRT3 reduced mitochondrial DNA damage and
maintained OGG1 levels [29, 62]. Similar to this
observation in the current study, HKL treatment reduced
mitochondrial DNA damage, decreased 8-oxo-dG levels
and increased mitochondrial functions. Mitochondrial
DNA mutations are directly associated with the etiology of
many diseases. Co-existence of the disease causing mutant
DNA with wild type DNA is defined as heteroplasmy.
Cells can tolerate mtDNA mutations to a large extent, until
the wild type to mutant DNA ratio increases above certain
threshold for manifestation of the clinical symptoms. This
varies with mutations and tissue types having a value in
the range of 60-90% [63]. Mitochondrial DNA mutations
increase exponentially in post-mitotic tissues [33].
Delayed onset of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity could
be because of the time required to reach the threshold ratio
of mitochondrial DNA mutations needed for dysfunction
of the heart. Further, because fission and fusion processes
help to redistribute mitochondrial metabolites, enzymes,
gene-products and DNA, it is rational to hypothesize that
defects in mitochondrial dynamics may also contribute
to perpetuation of mtDNA damage and development
of delayed cardiotoxicity (Figure 9) [64]. Our findings
suggests that HKL mediated mitochondrial protection
may alleviate delayed cardiac toxicity. In this context,
it is also imperative to consider that HKL has off target
effects on many other critical proteins, including NF-kb,
STAT3, mTOR, and EGFR, which could have added to the
observed effects [2].
Apart from its role in cardiac protection, SIRT3’s
role in cancer metabolism is also well studied. SIRT3 is a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

critical regulator of Warburg effect, a shift in metabolism
towards glycolysis in the presence of oxygen [11]. Sirt3.
KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed increased
glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism, and mice deficient in SIRT3 showed increased
propensity to develop cancers [20]. SIRT3 acts as a tumor
suppressor by inhibiting ROS production and activation
of HIF1α. SIRT3 functions as a tumor suppressor in
a variety of cancers including B cell malignancies,
prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Contrary
to these observations, activation of SIRT3 can also
confer protection to cancer cells. Increased expression
of SIRT3 was found in oral cancer and melanoma [65,
66]. In the present study, we did not find significant
difference in tumor volume between doxorubicin alone
or doxorubicin and HKL treated mice, suggesting that
cancer cell protective function of SIRT3 is not activated
in HKL treated cells. HKL is also well documented for its
role as an anticancer drug. HKL has been shown to reduce
various types of tumors in different animal models. In the
present study, we did not see any addictive effect of HKL
on doxorubicin’s cancer killing potential. This could be
because of the very low dose of HKL used in our study
(0.2mk/kg/day), compared to higher doses in other studies
[67, 68].
In summary, our results suggest that doxorubicininduced toxicity to the heart is associated with reduced
SIRT3 levels. HKL, an activator of SIRT3 can mitigate
Doxo-induced cardiotoxicity by maintaining SIRT3 levels,
and attenuating Doxo-induced mtDNA damage. Based
on our results we believe that HKL has the potential to
protect the heart from Doxo-induced toxicity without
compromising its chemotherapeutic potential.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cardiomyocyte culture
Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were prepared
from neonatal rat hearts. In brief, hearts were removed
from 2- to 3-day-old pups (Sprague-Dawley rats, either
sex) and kept in cold DMEM. Ventricles were cut into 4
to 6 evenly sized pieces using small scissors and digested
using collagenase type II (Worthington). The digested
solution was collected with the cannula-syringe, avoiding
the tissue chunks and was added to one of the already
aliquoted 10 ml FBS (100%). These steps were repeated
six to seven times till no tissue chunks are visible. Tissue
digest was spun and cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM
with 5% FBS. Cells were pre-plated for 1 h to remove
fibroblasts, and unattached cardiomyocytes in suspension
were collected and plated in fibronectin-coated culture
plates. Cardiomyocytes cultures were used after 24 h of
plating.

fragmented (40%), or fragmented mostly (20%). Three
independent experiments by two investigators blinded to
the treatment were carried out. Confocal microscope was
used to visualize the mitochondria.

Honokiol was purified and prepared as described
previously [69].

Citrate synthase activity assay

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection

Citrate Synthase activity was measured using citrate
synthase activity kit (BioVison Inc).

ROS levels were detected using CM-H2DCFDA
(Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
Primary cultures of cardiomyocytes were treated with 10
μM HKL for 24 hours in the presence or absence of 2
μM doxorubicin. Cells were stained with CM-H2DCFDA.
Cells were acquired by FACSCalibur and analyzed with
use of FlowJo. The mean fluorescence intensity of cells
positive for CM-H2DCFDA staining was determined.

Mitochondrial DNA damage assay
Genomic DNA was isolated using Qiagen
Genomic-tip 20/G and Qiagen DNA Buffer Set (Qiagen,
Gaithersburg, MD) per the manufacturer’s instruction.
Eluted DNA was incubated with isopropanol overnight
at -800C and centrifuged 12,000g for 60 min. DNA
was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in TE
buffer. PCR was performed using Ex-taq (Clonetech,
Mountain View, CA). Primer sequences for long
PCR are: forward, 5’ cccagctactaccatcattcaagtag3’
and reverse, 5’gagagattttatgggtgtaatgcggtg3’. Short
PCR was performed using forward primer sequence
5`gcaaatccatattcatccttctcaac3` and the reverse primer
sequences same as long PCR. Resultant PCR products
were quantified using Pico-green (Life Technologies).
Values obtained from the long fragments were normalized
using values from short fragments. The lesion frequency
per amplicon was then calculated as λ = −ln(AD/AO),
where AD/AO is the ratio of amplification of the treated
samples (AD) to the amplification of the control samples
(AO).

Cell death assay
Cardiomyocytes were cultured in 6-well plates and
were treated with 5 μM doxorubicin for 24 hours. Cells
were harvested from tissue culture plates and centrifuged
at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatant was removed,
and cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were
then resuspended in 100μl of cold 1x binding buffer, and
20μl of 7AAD (BD) was added. Samples were incubated
for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. A total of 400
μl of 1× binding buffer was added and analyzed by flow
cytometry using a FacScan analyzer (Becton-Dickinson,
San Jose, CA). Results were processed using FlowJo
software.

TMRM uptake

8-Oxo-dG level estimation

To monitor mitochondrial membrane potential
(ΔΨm), tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM;
Invitrogen), a ΔΨm-dependent cationic dye, was used. In
brief, primary cultures of cardiomyocytes were treated
with 10 μM HKL for 24 hours in the presence or absence
of 2 uM doxorubicin. Cells were stained with TMRM,
acquired by FACSCalibur and analyzed with use of
FlowJo. The mean fluorescence intensity of cells positive
for TMRM staining was determined.

8-Oxo-dG levels were estimated using 8-Oxo-dG
ELISA kit (Trevigen) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

Antibodies and immunoblotting
The OGG1 antibody was purchased from Novus
Biologicals. The actin, GAPDH and MFN1 antibodies
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. MnSOD antibody
was from Millipore. Ac-K122MnSOD antibody was
generated in Dr David Gius lab (Northwestern University).
Anti-SIRT3 and Anti-acetyl lysine antibody was from
cell signaling. All other antibodies were purchased from
BD biosciences. Cells or heart ventricular tissue lysates
were prepared in the RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris·HCl (pH
7.5), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), 5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM
β-glycerol phosphate, and 20 mM NaF and Sigma protease
inhibitors]. Typically, 20-50 μg of protein lysates was used

Mitochondrial morphology
Rat cardiomyocytes were overexpressed with
Ad.Mito-GFP (kindly provided by Paul Schumacker from
Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) and mitochondrial
morphology was determined as reported elsewhere [70,
71]. Briefly, 100 cells were randomly selected for each
treatment group and were designated as being either

ATP estimation

Measurement of mouse heart functions

ATP levels were estimated by using ATP
determination Kit (Molecular Probes) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Chest hair of mice were removed with a topical
depilatory agent and transthoracic echocardiography was
performed under inhaled isoflurane (~1%) for anesthesia,
delivered via nose cone. Limb leads were attached for
electrocardiogram gating, and the animals were imaged in
the left lateral decubitus position with a VisualSonics Vevo
770 machine, using a 30 MHz high-frequency transducer.
Body temperature was maintained using a heated
imaging platform and warming lamps. Two-dimensional
images were recorded in parasternal long- and shortaxis projections, with guided M-mode recordings at the
midventricular level in both views. LV (left ventricle)
cavity size and wall thickness were measured in at least
three beats from each projection and averaged. LV wall
thickness (interventricular septum [IVS] and posterior wall
[PW] thickness) and internal dimensions at diastole and
systole (LVIDd and LVIDs, respectively) were measured.
LV fractional shortening ([LVIDd—LVIDs]/LVIDd) and
relative wall thickness ([IVS thickness+PW thickness]/
LVIDd) were calculated from the M-mode measurements.

Real-time PCR analysis for mRNA levels
Total RNA was isolated from mouse hearts by using
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). The residual genomic DNA
was digested by incubating the RNA preparation with 0.5
units of RNase-free DNase-1 per microgram of RNA in 1
× reaction buffer for 15 min at room temperature, followed
by heat inactivation at 90°C for 5 min. Two micrograms
of DNase-treated RNA were reverse transcribed by use
of Fermentas, RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit. The resultant cDNA was diluted 10-fold before PCR
amplification. A reverse transcriptase minus reaction served
as a negative control. The mRNA levels were measured
by SYBR green real-time PCR. Primer sequences, ANF

Statistical analysis

TUNEL assay

Statistical differences among groups were
determined with either Student’s t-test (for two groups)
or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). P values less
than 0.05 were considered significant.

TUNEL assay was performed on heart sections
using CardioTACS In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (R&D
Systems Inc, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Doxorubicin treatment of mice
For In vivo tumor study, tumors were generated
in Athymic male BALB/c mice from Envigo, USA by
s.c. injection of PC-3 cells (1× 106 cells) with 50-μL
matrigel matrices (Corning). Seven days after tumor cell
implantation, mice were given first dose of doxorubicin.
Doxorubicin reconstituted in 0.85% sterile sodium
chloride was administered by intraperitoneal injection.
Control animals were also treated simultaneously with
identical volume of 0.85% sterile NaCl. Mice were treated
with 5mg/kg doxorubicin every 15 days for a total of three
doses (Cumulative dose 15mg/kg body weight). 15 days
after the last dose of doxorubicin cardiac hypertrophy
and heart functions of mice were studied. HKL treatment
(0.2mg/kg/day, IP) was started the day before doxorubicin
infusion and was maintained throughout the course of
the study. Tumor volume was calculated by ab2/2 where
“a” and “b” are the long and short axes of the tumor.
