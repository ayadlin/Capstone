The Growing Arsenal of ATP-Competitive and Allosteric
Inhibitors of BCR–ABL
Oliver Hantschel1, Florian Grebien2, and Giulio Superti-Furga2

Abstract
The BCR–ABL fusion kinase is the driving mutation of chronic myelogenous leukemias and is also expressed in
a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Recent advances in elucidating the structure, regulation, and signaling
of BCR–ABL have led to the identiﬁcation of allosteric sites that are distant from the ATP-binding pocket and are
critical for BCR–ABL–dependent oncogenic transformation. Here, we review the available data regarding the
molecular mechanism of action and the speciﬁcity of ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting BCR–
ABL. In addition, we discuss how targeting of allosteric sites could provide new opportunities to inhibit resistant
BCR–ABL mutants, either alone or in combination with conventional ATP-competitive inhibitors. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Translocation of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome leads to
expression of the chimeric BCR–ABL protein, which is a
constitutively active tyrosine kinase and a strong driver of
different leukemias in humans. Depending on the chromosomal breakpoint, 2 major isoforms of BCR–ABL, p210 and
p185, can be expressed. The p210 isoform is the molecular
hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML), and either
p185 or p210 is expressed in a subset of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (1). The Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
imatinib (Gleevec or Glivec; Novartis) binds to the ATPbinding cleft of the kinase domain and inhibits the kinase
activity of BCR–ABL. Administration of imatinib leads to
durable remissions in the majority of CML patients when
they are treated in the chronic phase and improves the
outcome in Phþ patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). However, the occurrence of point mutations in the
BCR–ABL kinase domain that reduce the imatinib sensitivity
of BCR–ABL is a leading cause of patient relapse, bearing the
risk of disease progression (2). Over the past few years,
investigators have developed second- and third-generation
TKIs that are active against imatinib-resistant BCR–ABL
mutants. Although some of these inhibitors have already
received regulatory approval, many more are currently under

going clinical trials. Still, short-lived responses in patients
with advanced-phase CML and Phþ ALL, general TKI resistance caused by the T315I mutation, compound mutations (2
or more mutations in the same clone), and foreseeable
problems with the long-term tolerability of all BCR–ABL
inhibitors remain challenging clinical problems (3). Here we
present an overview of the mechanisms of action, speciﬁcity,
and clinical efﬁcacy of BCR–ABL TKIs that bind to the ATPbinding cleft. We also discuss alternative strategies to inhibit
BCR–ABL by targeting allosteric regulatory modules of the
oncoprotein, which could be used to limit the problems
associated with current TKI treatment.

Different Classes of BCR–ABL Inhibitors
On the basis of their molecular mechanism of action, one can
distinguish 2 major classes of TKIs, both of which overlap with
the ATP-binding site (Fig. 1A; ref. 4). Type 1 inhibitors target the
active conformation of the kinase domain, which is catalytically
competent because all elements in the kinase domain are
properly arranged for catalysis and able to bind ATP and
substrate (Fig. 1A, left). In contrast, type 2 inhibitors target the
inactive conformation of the kinase domain. One of the signifying features of type 2 inhibitor binding is the DFG-out conformation, in which the Asp residue of the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly)
sequence motif at the beginning of the activation loop, which is
important for the proper positioning of ATP, is rotated out of the
active site (Fig. 1A, right). In general, it has been assumed that
type 1 inhibitors are less speciﬁc than type 2 inhibitors because
the active conformation is very similar in most kinases. Recently,
however, a systematic survey of the speciﬁcity of 72 type 1 and
type 2 inhibitors, many of which are in clinical use, showed that
this general assumption may be an oversimpliﬁcation because
several highly speciﬁc type 1 inhibitors and rather promiscuous
type 2 inhibitors exist as well (5). In contrast, allosteric inhibitors do not compete with ATP binding and bind to sites on
the kinase domain or other domains in the kinase that are
important regulators of kinase activity.

Different Strategies to Target BCR–ABL

with respect to the orientation of the SH2-kinase domain structure on the left and translated on the xy plane for graphical convenience. The following
PDB entries of the Abl kinase domain were used: imatinib (1OPJ), nilotinib (3CS9), dasatinib (2GQG), ponatinib (3IK3), DCC-2036 (3QRJ), PHA-739358 (2V7A),
VX-680 (2F4J), and GNF-2 (3K5V). Structural data for bosutinib or SGX393 are not publically available.

Imatinib: The "Magic Bullet" in the Treatment of
CML
Imatinib has revolutionized targeted cancer therapy, being
the ﬁrst TKI to be approved for the treatment of human disease
(Fig. 1C; ref. 6). As a type 2 inhibitor, it inhibits ABL kinase
activity with moderate afﬁnity in the 100-nmol/L range. Imatinib
is remarkably speciﬁc and inhibits only a few enzymes in addition to the ABL kinases, including the receptor tyrosine kinases
KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A/B (PDGFRA/B),
Discoidin domain receptor 1/2 (DDR1/2), and the oxidoreductase NQO2 (7). BCR–ABL mutations associated with imatinib
resistance cluster in distinct parts of the kinase domain (Fig. 1B):
G250E, Q252H, Y253H/F, and E255K/V in the Gly-rich loop
(now commonly but incorrectly termed the P-loop); T315I (the
gatekeeper residue); H395P/R in the activation loop; and
M244V, F317L, M351T, E355G, and F359V in other regions of
the kinase domain (8, 9). For most of these mutants, the degree of
TKI resistance is relatively mild, increasing the IC50 value for

www.aacrjournals.org

imatinib by only 10-fold. However, due to plasma/serum
concentrations of imatinib of 2 mmol/L in treated patients,
this mild resistance is sufﬁcient to restore BCR–ABL kinase
activity in CML cells carrying a kinase domain mutation (10).

Nilotinib and Dasatinib: Second-Generation
BCR–ABL TKIs
To meet the demand for inhibition of imatinib-resistant
BCR–ABL mutants, researchers developed the second-generation TKIs nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis) and dasatinib [Sprycel
Bristol-Myers Squibb (Fig. 1C)]. Dasatinib inhibits BCR–ABL at
10- to 20-fold lower concentrations than nilotinib, which is
yet 10- to 20-fold stronger than imatinib (11, 12). All common
imatinib resistance mutations, with the exception of the T315I
gatekeeper mutant, are efﬁciently inhibited by dasatinib and
nilotinib. In vitro screens for drug resistance clearly showed that
the spectrum of emerging resistance mutations is much smaller
with second-generation TKIs as compared with imatinib (13, 14).

Hantschel et al.

Certain differences in the relative sensitivities for particular
mutations in vitro and in cell lines would favor the use of one
second-generation TKI over another. For example, mutations in
the Gly-rich loop appear to be inhibited more efﬁciently by
dasatinib than nilotinib, whereas the F317L mutation is more
sensitive to nilotinib (10). However, because these differences
were determined in vitro, the clinical signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding is debatable (15). Currently, there is no strong support from
clinical data that would suggest the use of a particular drug
depending on a particular BCR–ABL mutation.
In contrast with the similarities observed in targeting imatinib resistance mutations, the mechanism of inhibition and
the speciﬁcity of nilotinib versus dasatinib differ dramatically.
Nilotinib, as a close derivative of imatinib, is a type 2 inhibitor,
whereas dasatinib is a type 1 inhibitor (Fig. 1A; ref. 16). Nilotinib
exploits an auxiliary binding pocket in the Abl kinase domain,
allowing an increase in lipophilic interactions. Together with a
decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds with the target, this
allows a greater ﬂexibility of the binding interface, explaining
the activity of nilotinib for a number of imatinib resistance
mutations (11). Despite having a target spectrum very similar
to that of imatinib, nilotinib shows higher speciﬁcity toward
BCR–ABL inhibition as compared with inhibition of Kit and
PDGFR (7, 11). In contrast, dasatinib inhibits several other
classes of tyrosine kinases, such as the Src, Tec, Csk, and Eph
families, as well as several Ser/Thr kinases besides ABL1/2, KIT,
PDGFRA/B, and DDR1/2 (7, 17). Many of these additional
kinase targets of dasatinib are inhibited with efﬁciencies
comparable to that observed for BCR–ABL, suggesting a
broad-range inhibition of tyrosine kinase signaling in dasatinib-treated cells. Therefore, the common designation of dasatinib as a dual Src–Abl inhibitor is misleading and should be
avoided. Another major difference is that dasatinib has a much
shorter plasma half-life than nilotinib. Initially, to ensure
continuous BCR–ABL inhibition in patients with CML, dasatinib was administered twice a day. Surprisingly, a clinical
comparison of dosing regimens (once vs. twice daily) showed
identical response rates but a signiﬁcantly lower level of certain
severe adverse events, such as pleural effusions and grade 3 to 4
thrombocytopenias, with single daily dosing (18). In line with
this, it was shown that a transient inhibition of BCR–ABL with
dasatinib, as short as 10 minutes, was sufﬁcient to induce
apoptosis in CML cells despite reactivation of BCR–ABL kinase
activity after removal of the inhibitor (19).
Both second-generation TKIs are now approved for ﬁrstline treatment of CML in chronic phase and CML in chronic
and accelerated phases in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant
patients. In addition, dasatinib is also approved for imatinibresistant/intolerant patients with blast crisis CML and Phþ ALL.
Another second-generation TKI is bosutinib (Bosulif/SKI606; Pﬁzer). After successful clinical trials (20), the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration has approved bosutinib to treat CML
patients in all disease stages that show intolerance or resistance to other therapies, including imatinib (21). Bosutinib has
characteristics similar to those of dasatinib. Being a potent
type 1 inhibitor with a broad-target spectrum, bosutinib also
inhibits the majority of imatinib resistance BCR–ABL mutants
other than the T315I gatekeeper mutation (22, 23). In contrast

4892

with dasatinib, however, bosutinib does not inhibit KIT and
PDGFR, and instead has a broad impact on Ser/Thr kinases,
including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
family (23).

Ponatinib and Other Third-Generation BCR–ABL
TKIs: Efﬁcient Targeting of BCR–ABL T315I
Despite the high number of preclinical candidates that
have been presented over the past 10 years, it is only recently
that the ﬁrst 2 third-generation TKIs targeting the pan-resistant BCR–ABL T315I gatekeeper mutant have entered clinical
evaluation. Previous approaches to target BCR–ABL T315I
focused on the use of kinase inhibitors that initially were
developed against other targets. For example, some available
inhibitors against the Aurora family of Ser/Thr kinases (e.g.,
Vx-680 and PHA-739358), which have a bulky gatekeeper
residue, also proved to be potent inhibitors of BCR–ABL
T315I (Fig. 1C; refs. 24, 25). However, clinical assessment
indicated a lack of effectivity and/or intolerable toxicity of
these compounds. Later, it was concluded that the proapoptotic activity of these drugs in CML cells is primarily associated
with inhibition of Aurora kinases and not with primary targeting of BCR–ABL (26).
Among the best-studied early inhibitors against BCR–ABL
T315I was SGX393, which strongly inhibited BCR–ABL T315I
and, in combination with nilotinib or dasatinib, preempted
the outgrowth of resistant clones in an in vitro resistance
screen (27).
In 2009, the type 2 inhibitor ponatinib (AP24534; Ariad
Pharmaceuticals) was shown to inhibit both wild-type and
imatinib-resistant BCR–ABL mutants, including T315I, with
similar potency (Fig. 1C; ref. 28). Additional ponatinib targets
were shown to be the SRC kinases and a number of receptor
tyrosine kinases (KIT, RET, PDGFR, VEGF receptor, DDR,
EPH, TRK, and FGFR family members), indicating mediumrange speciﬁcity (i.e., less speciﬁc than imatinib/nilotinib but
more speciﬁc than dasatinib/bosutinib). An ethinyl linkage
(C-C triple bond) in ponatinib allows binding of the compound
to the kinase domain despite the presence of the bulky isoleucine residue in the T315I gatekeeper mutation, which blocks the
binding of imatinib and second-generation Bcr-Abl TKIs.
Many other binding features of ponatinib are remarkably similar to those observed for nilotinib, such as the methylphenyl
and the triﬂuormethylphenyl rings that occupy almost identical positions when bound to the Abl kinase domain (Fig. 1C;
ref. 28). A phase II clinical trial of ponatinib showed promising
results in patients with the T315I mutation (29).
Recently, another inhibitor of BCR–ABL, T315I was reported
to show inhibitory characteristics similar to those of ponatinib (30). DCC-2036 (Deciphera Pharmaceuticals) uses a carboxamide-substituted pyridine ring to engage the hinge region
and a well-positioned ﬂuor-phenyl ring to evade clashes with
the gatekeeper residue (Fig. 1C). In addition, DCC-2036 binding leads to a displacement of the aC-helix and stabilization of
an inactive conformation of the kinase domain (30). In similarity to ponatinib, DCC-2036 has medium speciﬁcity. In
addition to BCR–ABL, it inhibits SRC kinases and a few

Different Strategies to Target BCR–ABL

receptor tyrosine kinases, including FLT3, TIE2, DDR2,
and MER, as well as EPH, TRK, and PDGFR family members,
but not KIT. The combination of low concentrations of DCC2036 with either nilotinib or dasatinib abrogated the emergence of drug-resistant colonies in cell-based mutagenesis
screens (31).
In summary, since the approval of imatinib in 2001, investigators have made enormous and rapid progress in developing
an arsenal of BCR–ABL TKIs. However, because all current
BCR–ABL TKIs target the ATP-binding site, it is likely that still
other resistance mechanisms will develop. Thus, strategies to
target regulatory modules in BCR–ABL different from the
kinase active site may represent an attractive alternative for
the treatment of CML.

Allosteric Targeting of the Myristate Pocket
Recently, several allosteric regions in the BCR–ABL molecule have been identiﬁed and shown to be potential drug
targets. In the following text, we review the most recent
developments in this active area of research. A structural
analysis of the autoinhibitory mechanisms of ABL revealed a
hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal lobe of the kinase
domain that accommodates the N-terminal myristoyl modiﬁcation of ABL (32, 33). Binding of the myristoyl group to
the myristate pocket induces a conformational change in the
C-terminal helix of the kinase domain that is necessary for
binding of the SH3-SH2 clamp, which keeps the kinase inactive
(34). Because BCR–ABL is not myristoylated, it was suggested
that this additional pocket could be used to target compounds
that mimic myristate binding and push the regulatory interactions toward autoinhibition (31). Indeed, compounds that
bind to the myristate pocket, such as GNF-2 (Fig. 1C), were later
shown to inhibit BCR–ABL–dependent cell growth and different imatinib resistance mutations, but not the T315I mutant
(35). In contrast, the combination of GNF-2 and nilotinib was
shown to prolong survival in a BCR–ABL T315I mouse model
(36). Therefore, the combination of ATP competitive and
myristate pocket inhibitors represents an innovative and
rational way to overcome resistance to either agent alone
[reviewed in Hantschel (37)].

Targeting Distant Allosteric Modules: Regulatory
Roles of the SH2 Domain
Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases show a conserved domain organization, with the SH2 domain preceding the catalytic domain in
most cases (38). Although the canonical function of the SH2
domain is binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, a series
of experiments with different cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases have
revealed additional regulatory roles of the SH2 domain in kinase
regulation that are independent of its primary feature.
Results from biochemical and cellular studies suggested
that the SH2 domain of the tyrosine kinases FES, SRC, and
CSK is necessary for kinase activity (39–41). Likewise, structure–function studies on the Tec-family kinase ITK also
suggested a phosphotyrosine-independent regulatory role
of the SH2 domain that stimulates catalytic activity of the
kinase (42).

www.aacrjournals.org

SH2-Kinase Interface in Active ABL and
BCR-ABL
Direct structural and mechanistic evidence for a stimulatory
function of the SH2 domain was obtained from structurefunction studies of the kinases FES and ABL (43). In the active
conformation of ABL, the SH2 domain binds to the N-terminal
lobe of the kinase domain (Fig. 1C). Similar conformations
were found in the crystal structure of active SRC, CSK, and FES
(44–46). Although superposition of the crystal structures
showed that the contact surfaces between the SH2 domain
and N-terminal lobe of the kinase domains are not conserved in
position or chemical nature among CSK, SRC, FES, or ABL,
mutational studies revealed that disruption of the SH2-kinase
interface led to a decrease in kinase activity in both FES and
ABL (46). Of importance, SH2-domain residues involved in the
formation of the interface are not involved in phosphotyrosine
binding.
The ﬁrst evidence that the interaction between the SH2 and
kinase domains inﬂuences leukemogenesis and can be subjected to pharmacologic interference was recently provided in
a study of BCR–ABL (47). A mutational analysis of the involved
residues in the SH2 domain showed that disruption of the SH2kinase interface reduced catalytic activity, whereas mutations
that stabilized the interface (initially identiﬁed in an imatinibresistant patient with CML) increased BCR–ABL kinase activity (48). Of note, all of these effects were independent of the
phosphotyrosine-binding capability of the BCR–ABL SH2
domain. Therefore, the SH2 domain of BCR–ABL acts as a
true allosteric activator of tyrosine kinase activity. Disruption
of the SH2-kinase domain interface completely abrogated
cellular transformation and leukemia formation in a mouse
bone marrow transplant model. This was accompanied by a
selective loss of activation of the transcription factor STAT5, a
hallmark event that is critical for CML pathogenesis. Disruption of the SH2-kinase interface also increased BCR–ABL's
susceptibility to inhibition by TKIs, and even partly restored
sensitivity toward nilotinib in the pan-resistant BCR–ABL
T315I mutant (47).
Targeting an interdomain association that covers a substantial surface area and has no obvious pockets poses a
signiﬁcant challenge. To target the SH2-kinase domain interface in BCR–ABL, Grebien and colleagues (47) sought to
generate a monobody protein that would bind to the SH2
domain with very high afﬁnity and thus prevent the formation
of the SH2 kinase interface. Monobodies are small, singledomain proteins based on the ﬁbronectin III scaffold that
can be engineered to bind to a bait protein of choice with very
high afﬁnity. It was shown that a monobody that targets
the ABL SH2 domain could indeed interfere with the formation
of the SH2-kinase domain interface in BCR–ABL. This monobody inhibited BCR–ABL kinase activity and induced apoptosis in CML cell lines and primary human CML cells (47).
Delivery of the monobody was achieved through lentiviral
transduction/transfection in these experiments. Although
this manner of delivery may at ﬁrst glance seem to limit the
use of monobody proteins in vivo, other routes of intracellular targeting of monobody proteins should be evaluated for

future therapeutic use. The future will show whether the
SH2-kinase interface in BCR–ABL and other oncogenic tyrosine kinases can be subjected to pharmacologic inhibition
via small molecules that can be applied to treat patients with
resistance to TKIs. Although protein–protein interfaces were
considered to be undruggable until recently, the clinical use
of the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 targeting Bcl-2 family members
led investigators to reconsider this old dogma in drug discovery (49, 50).

Socioeconomic Aspects and Outlook
Despite all efforts to inhibit BCR–ABL, TKI therapy is failing
to cure CML due to the persistence of treatment-insensitive
CML stem cells (51). Therefore, patients with CML must take
imatinib or one of its successors continuously for several years.
Probably not surprisingly, a signiﬁcant fraction of patients do
not take their imatinib pills regularly. This was shown to be the
main reason for a cytogenetic relapse in long-term imatinib
therapy (52). Chronic side effects of TKI treatment, such as
nausea, diarrhea, and skin rashes, are a contributing factor in
this poor compliance. Although these side effects are often
mild and occur only transiently, they are clearly bothersome
and affect the patients' quality of life (3). It was concluded that
imatinib can be safely discontinued in patients who have been
in deep remission for more than 2 years with undetectable
BCR–ABL transcripts (53). In addition, it should be mentioned
that the annual costs of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib
amount to several tens of thousands of dollars per patient.
Depending on the health care system in the country of residence, this may represent a large ﬁnancial burden for the

patient. We anticipate that more BCR–ABL TKIs will be
entering clinical practice in the coming decade, and possible
combinations of these TKIs will be evaluated. Furthermore,
imatinib will lose patent protection in 2015, and data on overall
survival differences with second-generation TKIs as compared
with imatinib will become available. As a result, new guidelines
for ﬁrst-line CML treatment, weighing the beneﬁts and costs of
the different TKIs, may be deﬁned.
Despite all these unknowns, we can state with reasonable
certainty that the hunt for innovative approaches to BCR–ABL
inhibition and CML therapy will continue, keeping the CML
research community at the forefront of therapeutic innovation
and personalized treatment.
