BACKGROUND. The authors estimated and characterized mortality after androgen
suppression therapy (AST) use in men with newly diagnosed localized and recurrent prostate cancer.

METHODS. The study cohorts comprised 102 men who were randomized to radiation therapy (RT) and AST and 46 men who underwent salvage AST for recurrence from a randomized trial that compared external beam RT and 6 months of

severe as compared with no or minimal comorbidity (adjusted HR [AHR], 11.5;
95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2-25.6; P < .001) in men with newly diagnosed
localized prostate cancer but not in men with recurrent prostate cancer (AHR,

CONCLUSIONS. The ability to measure an increase in the risk of death in men
with moderate to severe as compared with no or minimal comorbidity undergoing AST decreases as the risk of PCSM increases, which may explain the discordance in the literature regarding the risk of cardiovascular death and AST use.

vidence has been accumulating describing an association
between androgen suppression therapy (AST) use for prostate
cancer in men of advancing age and an increased risk from nonprostate cancer causes of death and, in particular, myocardial infarction (MI).1-4 Most recently this association was noted in a
hypothesis generating postrandomization analysis to translate into a
trend toward a decrease in overall survival in men randomized to
external beam radiation therapy (RT) and 6 months of AST therapy
as compared with RT alone if their comorbid illness at the time of
randomization was considered moderate to severe,5 defined using
the validated Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) comorbidity
instrument.6 However, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in
that study5 in men with localized disease was estimated at only 2%
8 years after randomization to RT and AST. Given that the increased

risk of death from MIs has been small (ie, 1% to 3%
by 5 years),3,4 this increase could be more easily
observed in a population where the cancer death
rate was also small,5 because in those men fatal MIs
would double the death rate. In contrast, a 1% to 3%
increase in death from fatal MIs may not be easily
observed in men enrolled in the Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group (RTOG) prostate cancer randomized
trials of locally advanced prostate cancer, where cancer death rates approached 20% by 10 years after
randomization.7-9
To test this hypothesis, the current study was
designed to evaluate the prognostic significance of
comorbidity score on the risk of all cause mortality
(ACM) adjusting for age and known prostate cancer
prognostic factors in 2 populations. The first population comprised men with localized prostate cancer at
presentation randomized to undergo RT and AST,
where the death rate from prostate cancer was
observed to be 2% at 8 years after randomization.
The second population of men was derived from the
same randomized study and comprised those who
experienced a recurrence necessitating AST use.4 In
this second population, the death rate from prostate
cancer would be expected to be significantly higher
than in the first population and more similar to men
with locally advanced disease enrolled in the prior
RTOG studies.7-9

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population and Treatment
Between December 1, 1995 and April 15, 2001 206
men (median age, 72.5 years; range, 49-82 years)
with 1992 American Joint Commission on Cancer
clinical stage10 T1b to T2bN0M0 and at least 1 unfavorable prognostic factor were randomized to receive
RT alone (n 5 104) or in combination with 6 months
of AST (n 5 102). RT alone consisted of 3-dimensional conformal RT. Androgen suppression therapy
consisted of a luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist and the antiandrogen flutamide. Unfavorable prognostic factors included a
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of more than 10
ng/mL (maximum, 40 ng/mL); a biopsy Gleason
score of 7 to 10; cancer or radiographic evidence of
extracapsular extension; and/or seminal vesicle invasion using endorectal magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Of these 206 men, 46 required AST use for a
PSA level that approached 10 ng/mL during the
course of follow-up. Thirty-three of the 46 men were
from the 104 men initially randomized to RT, and the
remaining 13 were from the 102 men randomized to
RT and AST. AST use at the time of PSA recurrence

3291

consisted of an orchiectomy in 5 and an LHRH agonist in 41 men. The LHRH agonist was given continuously and in quarterly 3-month depots. Antiandrogens
were not used at the time of recurrence.
The study populations in the current study are
comprised of the 102 men with localized prostate
cancer randomized to RT and AST and the 46 men
who received AST for recurrence. Prostate needle
biopsy specimens underwent central review by a pathologist with expertise in genitourinary pathology.
Before study entry, all men signed an institutional
review board–approved, protocol-specific informed
consent form in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. This trial has been registered on
the National Institutes of Health website http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov with NCT# 00116220. The
exclusion criteria, registration, randomization, stratification, treatment, and quality assurance guidelines
for this study have been previously described.5

The Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27
By using detailed information on pre-existing medical conditions and comorbidities collected at baseline before randomization, a comorbidity score was
assigned using ACE-27, a 27-item validated comorbidity index for use in patients with cancer.6 The
index was used to assign diseases of specific conditions to 1 of 4 levels of comorbidity (grade 0 [none],
grade 1 [minimal], grade 2 [moderate], grade 3
[severe]) according to the severity of the individual
organ system decompensation and prognostic
impact. The instrument can be found at http://oto.
wustl.edu/clinepi/calc.html. An important point,
however, is that this instrument does not capture
prior or current tobacco use. For the purpose of this
study, comorbidity scores were grouped as 0 or 1
versus 2 or 3 based on the prognostic significance
of this grouping shown in a prior study.5
Follow-up and Determination of the Cause of Death
Follow-up started on the day of randomization and
concluded on June 15, 2007 or the date of death,
whichever came first; no patient was lost to followup. Patients were seen every 3 months for 2 years,
every 6 months for an additional 3 years, and then
annually thereafter. At each follow-up, a history and
physical examination including a digital rectal examination (DRE) was performed in addition to a serum
prostate specific-antigen (PSA) level before the DRE.
At the time of PSA failure, in addition to the routine
follow-up assessment, pelvic computerized tomography or MRI and a bone scan were also obtained. AST

administration for PSA failure was recommended
when the PSA level reached 10 ng/mL.
The attending oncologist who followed the
patient until death determined the cause of death.
To record a death as being because of prostate cancer, there had to be documented hormone-refractory
metastatic prostate cancer and evidence that the PSA
level was increasing at the time of the last follow-up
visit despite the use of second line hormonal maneuvers and cytotoxic chemotherapy before death. To record a death from cardiovascular disease, an acute
MI needed to be determined as the immediate cause
of death by the attending oncologist.

STATISTICAL METHODS
Causes of Death and Estimates of All Cause and Prostate
Cancer-specific Mortality
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the
clinical characteristics at randomization and at the
time of initiation of AST for recurrence, and are
shown in Table 1. The method of Kaplan and Meier11
and cumulative incidence12 were used to estimate
and characterize overall survival and PCSM, respectively. Comparisons of these estimates were performed
using log-rank and K-sample tests, respectively.13
Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death or the date of last
follow-up. For the purpose of illustration, estimates

of overall survival and the cumulative incidence of
PCSM stratified by the ACE-276 comorbidity score
were graphically displayed. Two-sided P < .05 was
considered statistically significant.

Predictors of All Cause Mortality
Cox regression multivariable analyses14 were used to
evaluate whether the risk of ACM was significantly
associated with the ACE-27–defined comorbidity
score at randomization in the 102 men randomized
to receive RT and AST and in the 46 men who
received AST for recurrence, adjusting for age and
known prostate cancer prognostic factors. In the later
model time, 0 was defined as the date of AST initiation for recurrence, whereas in the former model
time, 0 was defined as the date of randomization. In
addition to the baseline PSA level, Gleason score, Tcategory, initial treatment at randomization, age at
time of AST initiation for recurrence, and an interaction term for initial treatment and comorbidity, factors know to be significant predictors of PCSM at the
time of recurrence were included in the model. Specifically these factors included the PSA doubling time
(DT) and the interval to PSA recurrence. PSA level,
PSA DT, and the interval to PSA recurrence were log
transformed to ensure they followed a normal distribution and were treated as continuous variables, as
was age. PSA DT was also considered a categorical

variable, as were Gleason score and T-category. PSA
recurrence was defined using the American Society
for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology consensus
definition15 for men undergoing RT and AST as
nadir 1 2 ng/mL. This definition could be used
because men did not start AST for recurrence until
the PSA level approached 10 ng/mL.
For categorical variables, cut-points were determined before the analysis based on established clinically relevant strata.16,17 Specifically, baseline groups
for categorical variables were defined as Gleason

the 2 models was that no deaths were observed in
men with Gleason score 6 or less who received AST
for recurrence. The assumptions of the Cox model
were tested, and no evidence that these assumptions
were violated was found. Unadjusted and adjusted
hazard ratios (AHRs)14 for ACM with associated 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) and P values were calculated for each covariate. R version 2.1.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was

Predictors of All Cause Mortality
Among the 102 men with newly diagnosed localized
prostate cancer randomized to RT and AST, 30 died
after a median follow-up of 8.4 years (interquartile
range [IQR], 7.2-9.6 years). After adjusting for known
prostate cancer prognostic factors and age, there was
an increased risk of death in men with moderate to
severe as compared with no minimal comorbidity
(AHR, 11.5; 95% CI, 5.2-25.6; P < .001), as shown in
Table 3 and illustrated in Figure 3.
Of the 46 men who required AST for recurrence,
24 died after a median follow-up of 5.1 years (IQR,
2.6-6.7) defining time 0 as the date of initiation of
AST for recurrence. In this setting, as noted in Table
4 and illustrated in Figure 4, an increased risk of
death was not observed (AHR, 2.5; 95% CI, 0.2-37.8;
P 5 .51) in men with moderate or severe as compared with no or minimal comorbidity after adjusting for known prognostic factors, initial treatment,
and age at the time of AST initiation for recurrence.
Factors associated with an increased risk of
death in men undergoing AST for recurrence
included both Gleason score 8 to 10 (AHR, 4.3; 95%

Discordance exists in the literature1-9 as to whether
there is a significantly increased risk of death
because of cardiovascular causes after AST use in
men managed with RT and AST as compared with RT
for prostate cancer. A possible explanation for the
discordance is provided in the current study. Namely,
the results of this study show that as the risk of
PCSM increases, the ability to observe a significant
difference in ACM in men with moderate to severe
as compared with no or minimal comorbid illness
lessens. This observation is consistent with the concept of competing risks that has been well described
and evaluated in cancer studies.18 Therefore, the
finding that the PCSM estimates were significantly
higher in the RTOG 8610 study,7 which comprised
men with locally advanced prostate cancer diagnosed
during the pre- to early PSA era, compared with the
current study of men with clinically localized but
unfavorable-risk prostate cancer diagnosed during
the PSA era, could explain the discordance. An additional factor that could explain this lack of significance in the RTOG 8610 study7 was that their
analysis of time to cardiovascular death was not stratified by baseline comorbidity, and in a prior report5
of the current study it appeared that mortality was
only increased with AST use in men with moderate
to severe comorbidity.

3296

CANCER

December 15, 2008 / Volume 113 / Number 12

The clinical relevance of this study’s findings is
that in men with moderate or severe comorbidity, in
particular pre-existing cardiovascular disease and in
whom the risk of PCSM is low, AST use should be
used judiciously. Specifically, it may be best not to
administer AST to such men with known coronary
artery disease (CAD) until the underlying CAD is
addressed.
Several points deserve further consideration.
There are 2 possible reasons why an increase in the
risk of death was noted after the initial 6-month
course of AST in men with moderate to severe as
compared with no or minimal comorbidity but not
in men who underwent continuous and long-term
AST for recurrence. First, it is possible that a small
increase in the risk of death may exist in men with
moderate or severe comorbidity undergoing AST for
recurrence despite a high rate of PCSM. However,
given only 46 men in the recurrent group (6 with
moderate to severe and 40 with no or minimal
comorbidity), this study was not powered to observe
a small risk. Evidence for a possible increase in mortality in the men with recurrent prostate cancer and
moderate to severe as compared with no or minimal
comorbidity is provided by the AHR of 2.5; however,
this value, although >1, is not well defined given the
95% CI range from 0.2 to 37.8. A larger study is
needed to more accurately define this value and to
ascertain if it is truly >1.0. Second, the cumulative
incidence of PCSM in men with recurrent disease
reached 36% 5 years after the initiation of AST for recurrence, whereas this value was 0% after randomization in men receiving RT and AST for de novo
disease. The large proportion of men dying of prostate cancer in the recurrent group and in short order
could have prevented death from being observed as
a result of the AST-induced metabolic syndrome.
Conversely, in men with de novo prostate cancer
treated with RT and AST, no patient died of prostate
cancer for 5 years after randomization, increasing
the likelihood that death from the metabolic consequences of AST would be observed. Next, the results
of this study raise the question of whether neoadjuvant AST, which is used to reduce prostate size
before prostate brachytherapy, should be reconsidered in men with moderate to severe comorbidity
and low-risk disease, where the potential for AST use
to adversely impact survival is higher because the
risk of PCSM is low. In support of this conjecture is 1
study19 in which men of median age 73 years were
treated with prostate brachytherapy, and a significant
association was observed between the use of neoadjuvant AST and an increase in ACM when compared
with men who did not receive neoadjuvant AST. In

that study,19 48% of the men had low-risk disease. A
similar study20 did not find a significant association
between neoadjuvant AST use and overall survival. In
that study,20 however, as compared with the prior
study,19 men were younger (median age, 67 years),
and a smaller proportion (35%) had low-risk disease. Both the lower proportion of men with lowrisk disease and the younger cohort who are less
likely to have moderate to severe comorbidity may
provide the explanation for the discrepancy. Moreover, other studies have reported a decreased overall
survival in men with low-risk21 or localized disease22 receiving AST with an LHRH agonist and/or a
nonsteroidal antiandrogen. Specifically, 1 study
included men with low-risk disease from a 22,816patient study21 derived from a linked database containing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results national cancer registry and Medicare claims
from 1992 to 2000. The second study was the early
Prostate Cancer Program Trial,22 which included
men with localized disease who elected watchful
waiting, presumably because of coexisting comorbid
illness. These men were randomized to receive 150
mg of bicalutamide or placebo. The decrement in
overall survival was noted in the men randomized
to receive bicalutamide as compared with placebo.
In these studies,21,22 however, as well as in the current study, past or current tobacco use was not
adjusted for, and serum testosterone levels to assess
whether the patient was hypo- or eugonadal were
not collected. Such data should be incorporated
into future studies, because they could potentially
impact the results. Finally, whether the increased
risk of death in men with moderate to severe
comorbidity and a low risk of PCSM increases with
increasing duration of AST use or with the reintroduction of AST use, which would be the case when
intermittent AST is used, remains unknown and
deserves further study.
Despite these considerations, it appears that the
ability to measure an increase in the risk of death in
men with moderate to severe as compared with no
or minimal comorbidity undergoing AST decreases
as the risk of PCSM increases. This observation may
explain the discordance in the literature regarding
the risk of cardiovascular death and AST use. Therefore, although 6 months of AST use in conjunction
with RT should continue in men with localized but
unfavorable-risk disease because of the survival benefit demonstrated by a randomized trial,5 AST use
should be more judicious in select men. Specifically,
for men with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and
in whom the risk of PCSM is low, it may be best to
not administer AST until the current state of the

Causes of Death in Prostate Cancer/D’Amico et al

underlying cardiovascular disease is assessed and
addressed.
