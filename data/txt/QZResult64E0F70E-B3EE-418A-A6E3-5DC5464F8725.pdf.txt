ABSTRACT
STAT3 plays a pivotal role in the hematopoietic system, which constitutively
activated by BCR–ABL via JAK and Erk/MAP-kinase pathways. Phospho-STAT3 was
overexpressed in imatinib-resistant CML patients as relative to imatinib responsive
ones. By activation of the STAT3 pathway, BCR–ABL can promote cell cycling, and
inhibit differentiation and apoptosis. Ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27a) performs
extra-ribosomal functions besides imparting a role in ribosome biogenesis and
post-translational modifications of proteins. RPS27a can promote proliferation,
regulate cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis of leukemia cells. However, the
relationship between STAT3 and RPS27a has not been reported. In this study, we
detected a significantly increased expression of STAT3 and RPS27a in bone marrow
samples from CML-AP/BP patients compared with those from CML-CP. In addition,
we also demonstrated that it was a positive correlation between the level of STAT3
and that of RPS27a. Imatinib-resistant K562/G01 cells expressed significantly higher
levels of STAT3 and RPS27a compared with those of K562 cells. RPS27a could be
transactivated by p-STAT3 through the specific p-STAT3-binding site located nt −633
to −625 and −486 to −478 of the RPS27a gene promoter in a dose-dependent manner.
The transactivated RPS27a could decrease the percentage of apoptotic CML cells
induced by imatinib. And the effect of STAT3 overexpression could be counteracted
by the p-STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 or RPS27a knockdown. These results suggest that
drugs targeting STAT3/p-STAT3/RPS27a combining with TKI might represent a novel
therapy strategy in patients with TKI-resistant CML.

INTRODUCTION

drugs and the first-line treatment for CML, resistance
to imatinib seems unavoidable and occurs frequently
during its clinical application. Before the era of TKIs,
CML patients in chronic phase (CML-CP) progressed
to a more accelerated phase (CML-AP) after a median
interval of about 5 years. CML-AP patients might still
respond to treatment for months or years, but eventually
developed a very aggressive blast phase (CML-BP),
after which the median survival was about 6 months.
Some patients progressed directly to CML-BP without an
intermediate phase of acceleration. CML-BP is associated
with dramatic changes in the leukemia cell phenotype:

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a common
hematologic malignancy, characterized by the formation
of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and BCR-ABL fusion
gene [1]. As a constitutively active tyrosine kinase,
BCR-ABL protein gives rise to uncontrolled growth of
myeloid cells in the bone marrow through a series of
downstream pathways [2]. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) imatinib is a specific molecular target-drug for
the treatment of Ph chromosome-positive CML [3–6].
Although it is considered as one of the most effective

enhanced “stemness”, uncontrolled proliferation and
invasion, abrogated differentiation, and early resistance
to TKIs [7, 8]. Previous researches demonstrated that
response to imatinib in patients with advanced CML was
less prominent than that in CML-CP [9, 10]. At present,
the molecular mechanisms responsible for these extensive
changes are still uncertain; most likely, they involve
activation of oncogenic factors, inactivation of tumor
suppressors, or both. And abnormal expression of some
other genes (P-glycoprotein (p-gp), AXL, heat-shock
protein 70 (Hsp-70), STAT3, STAT5, Cancerous inhibitor
of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A), B cell-specific MLV
inte-gration site-1 (BMI-1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) were highly expressed and
SHP-1, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 3 (CDKI3),
Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP), NOTCH2 were lowly
expressed) or alternative signaling pathways activation
may also contribute to imatinib resistance [11–26].
Ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27a) is one of two (the
other one is L40) ribosomal proteins naturally synthesized
as an ubiquitin (Ub) C-terminal extension protein [27, 28].
Besides imparting a role in ribosome biogenesis and posttranslational modifications of proteins, RPS27a could
perform extra-ribosomal functions [29, 30]. In previous
researches, we found that the expression level of RPS27a
was significantly higher in patients with CML-AP/BP
than that in patients with CML-CP. The expression level
of RPS27a was high in K562 cells and even higher in
imatinib resistant K562/G01 cells. The ablation of RPS27a
expression could inhibit the proliferation, induce cell cycle
arrest and potentiate the effect of imatinib on apoptosis
of K562 and K562/G01 cells partially through Raf/MEK/
ERK, P21 and BCL-2 signaling pathways [31]. As the
level of RPS27a expression was associated with clinical
stages in CML patients in our study, it was speculated
that RPS27a might be involved in the transformation of
CML-CP to CML-AP/BP and implicated in the response
to imatinib treatment.
To explore the mechanism of RPS27a up-regulation
in the transition from CML-CP to CML-AP/BP, We
hypothesized that some highly expressed proteins (Pgp, AXL, Hsp-70, STAT3, STAT5, CIP2A, BMI-1 and
ABCG2) in imatinib resistant CML cells contributed to
the up-regulation of RPS27a gene [13–19, 21, 22, 32].
The transcriptional regulation of RPS27a was investigated
using the luciferase reporter assay after transiently
transfecting cells with some common transcription
factors such as P-gp, AXL, Hsp-70, STAT3, STAT5,
CIP2A, BMI-1 and ABCG2. There was a significant
(about twelve-fold) increase in the FL-RPS27a reporter
gene activity in the presence of STAT3. It implied that
STAT3 might transactivate RPS27a gene. And we
detected the level of STAT3 and RPS27a in bone marrow
samples from CML-AP/BP and CML-CP Patients. We
found that STAT3 was up-regulated in the transition
from CML-CP to CML-AP/BP and there was a positive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

correlation between the expression level of STAT3 and
that of RPS27a. And imatinib resistant K562/G01 cells
expressed significantly higher levels of STAT3 and
RPS27a compared with those of K562 cells. STAT3
played a pivotal role in the hematopoietic system. BCRABL could induce activation of STAT3 via two different
pathways, i.e. JAK and Erk/MAP-kinase [32, 33]. And
the level of p-STAT3 was found to be higher in imatinib
resistant CML patients than in imatinib responsive ones.
In the study, we explored the possible relationship of
STAT3 and RPS27a and their roles in CML cells. We
found that RPS27a could be transactivated by p-STAT3
through the specific p-STAT3-binding site located nt −633
to −625 and nt −486 to −478 in the RPS27a gene promoter
in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, it was reported
for the first time, that RPS27a transactivated by p-STAT3
could inhibit the effect of imatinib on apoptosis of K562
cells.

RESULTS
STAT3 is a key activator of the RPS27a
promoter
To explore the mechanism of RPS27a up-regulation
in the transition from CML-CP to CML-AP/BP, We
hypothesized that some highly expressed proteins (P- gp,
AXL, Hsp-70, STAT3, STAT5, CIP2A, BMI-1 and
ABCG2) in imatinib resistant CML cells contributed to
the up-regulation of RPS27a gene. The DNA sequence
of 1.6-kb full-length human RPS27a gene (FL-RPS27a)
was cloned into luciferase reporter constructs. The
transcriptional regulation of RPS27a was investigated
using the luciferase reporter assay after transiently
transfecting cells with pCMV-P-gp, pCMV-AXL,
pCMV-Hsp-70, pCMV-STAT3, pCMV-STAT5, pCMVCIP2A, pCMV-BMI-1 and pCMV-ABCG2. There was
a significant (about ten-fold) increase in the FL-RPS27a
reporter gene activity in the presence of pCMV-STAT3
(Figure 1A). It implied that STAT3 was a key activator of
the RPS27a promoter.

STAT3 and RPS27a are highly expressed in
CML-AP/BP, and K562/G01 cells; and there is a
positive correlation between STAT3 and RPS27a
To explore the possible role of STAT3 and RPS27a
in CML cells, we first investigated the expression levels
of STAT3 and RPS27a in CML-CP and CML-AP/BP.
Relative quantification using qRT-PCR revealed a striking
increase of STAT3 and RPS27a mRNA expression in
bone marrow samples from CML-AP/BP patients than
that from CML-CP patients (Figure 1B and 1C). And
there was a positive correlation between the expression
level of STAT3 and RPS27a (Figure 1D and 1E). Then
we detected the expression level of STAT3 and RPS27a in
18639

bone marrow samples from respective CP and BP of two
CML patients. We found that STAT3 and RPS27a were
simultaneously up-regulated in the transition from CP to
BP of the two CML patients (Figure 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D).
We also compared the expression levels of STAT3 and
RPS27a in K562 with those of K562/G01 cells in order
to explore whether STAT3 and RPS27a played a role in

the responsiveness of cells to imatinib. It was found that
K562/G01 cells expressed significantly higher levels of
STAT3, p-STAT3 and RPS27a compared with those of
K562 cells (Figure 2E and 2F). It was inferred that STAT3
and RPS27a might be involved in the transition from CP to
BP of CML or the responsiveness of CML cells to imatinib
treatment.

RPS27a can be up-regulated by P-STAT3 in
HEK293T cells

(Figure 3A). The overexpression of STAT3 upregulated
levels of p-STAT3 protein and RPS27a protein (Figure 3B).
When the phosphorylation of STAT3 was inhibited, the
up-regulation of RPS27a didn’t occur in HEK293T cells
(Figure 3C and 3D). WP1066 is one of p-STAT3 inhibitors.
The level of RPS27a was down-regulated as the p-STAT3
was inhibited by WP1066 gradually. The above data
indicated that the up-regulation of RPS27a was dependent
on the phosphorylation of STAT3.

To explore the possible relationship of STAT3 and
RPS27a, we investigated the changes of p-STAT3 and
RPS27a expression after STAT3 was over-expressed
in HEK293T cells. Relative quantification using qRTPCR revealed a striking increase of RPS27a mRNA
expression as STAT3 was overexpressed in HEK293T cells

we generated a serial of RPS27a luciferase reporter gene

site (nt −633 to −625 TGCCCGGGA and −486 to −478

into HEK293 cells. As shown in Figure 4A, the luciferase
activity of S934B, S594B and S441B were activated by
p-STAT3. And the luciferase activity of S934B were the
strongest. While the luciferase activity of Mu934B couldn’t
be activated by p-STAT3. It indicated that the element
required for p-STAT3 transactivation activity was mainly
located nt −633 to −625 and nt −486 to −478 upstream
of the RPS27a transcription start site. Moreover, p-STAT3

transactivated the RPS27a promoter in a dose-dependent
manner. S934B luciferase activity was observed to be upregulated as the dose of S934B increased. (Figure 4B) and
a 6-fold increase in S934B luciferase activity was observed
in pCMV5-STAT3 group at a dose of 80 ng. (Figure 4C).
These results showed that p-STAT3 could transactivate
RPS27a in a dose-dependent manner. To further confirm
the specific binding of p-STAT3 to RPS27a promoter
at nt −633 to −625 and nt −486 to −478, chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays were performed using K562/

and the chromatin immunoprecipitated by anti-p-STAT3

the anti-STAT3 antibody group, the immunoglobulin G

The chromatin immunoprecipitation data demonstrated
the in vivo-specific binding of p-STAT3 to promoter of the
RPS27a gene.

To confirm the effect of STAT3 overexpression
in the regulation of cell apoptosis induced by imatinib
of CML cells relies on the transactivation of RPS27a
by p-STAT3. One RPS27a specific shRNA was applied
to down-regulate RPS27a expression in K562-STAT3
cells. As expected, stable infection experiments showed
RPS27a-shRNA could significantly down-regulate
RPS27a expression in K562 -STAT3 cells in mRNA and
protein levels (Figure 6C and 6D). Then we analyzed
chemosensitivity of K562-STAT3-RPS27a-sh and K562STAT3-RPS27a-scr cells to imatinib treatment. As the
expression of RPS27a was down-regulated in K562STAT3- RPS27a-sh cells, MTT assays showed that the
IC50s of imatinib at 48 h and 72 h increased (Figure 6E).
The results indicated that blocking the p-STAT3-RPS27a
pathway could rescue the sensitivity of K562 cells to
imatinib treatment. Then we investigated whether the
enhanced chemosensitivity could induce more RPS27aknockdown K562-STAT3 cells undergoing apoptosis by
using Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647-A/PI double staining.
The results showed that blocking the p-STAT3/RPS27a
pathway significantly increased the percentage of
apoptotic K562-STAT3 cells after incubation with 0.5 μM
and 1.0 μM imatinib for 48 h compared with that of
K562-STAT3-RPS27a-scr cells (Figure 6F). The
results showed the STAT3/p-STAT3/RPS27a pathway
participated in the regulation of chemosensitivity of CML
cells to imatinib treatment.

Transactivation of RPS27a by P-STAT3,
regulates chemosensitivity of CML cells to
imatinib
As STAT3 and RPS27a were highly expressed in
CML-AP/BP and the expression of RPS27a could be upregulated by p-STAT3, the role of STAT3 and RPS27a
in CML cells was elucidated by using K562 cells. We
investigated the level of RPS27a, p-STAT3 and STAT3
after infection with pcDNA3.1-STAT3. As expected, stable
infection experiments showed RPS27a, p-STAT3 and
STAT3 could be significantly up-regulated in K562-STAT3
cells in mRNA and protein levels, compared with those
of K562-con cells (Figure 5A and 5B). Then we analyzed
chemosensitivity of K562-STAT3 cells to imatinib
treatment. As the expression of STAT3 was up-regulated
in K562-STAT3 cells, MTT assays showed that the IC50s
of imatinib at 48 h and 72 h increased (Figure 5C). The
results indicated that overexpression of STAT3 could
inhibit the sensitivity of K562 cells to imatinib treatment.
Furthermore, we investigated whether the inhibited
chemosensitivity could induce less K562-STAT3 cells
undergoing apoptosis by using Annexin V-Alexa Fluor
647-A/PI double staining. The results showed that STAT3
overexpression alone didn’t influence the percentage of
apoptotic cells without imatinib treatment. Interestingly,
STAT3 overexpression significantly decreased the
percentage of apoptotic K562-STAT3 cells after incubation
with 0.5 μM and 1.0 μM imatinib for 48 h compared with
that of K562-con cells (Figure 5D).
To confirm the effect of STAT3 overexpression
in the regulation of cell apoptosis induced by imatinib
of CML cells relies on the overexpression of p-STAT3.
WP1066, one p-STAT3 inhibitor was applied to block
the activity of p-STAT3 protein (Figure 6A). Then we
analyzed chemosensitivity of K562-STAT3 cells to
imatinib treatment. We investigated whether the enhanced
chemosensitivity could induce more K562-STAT3 cells
undergoing apoptosis by using Annexin V-Alexa Fluor
647-A/PI double staining in the presence of WP1066.
As expected, inhibition of p-STAT3 protein by WP1066
significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic
K562-STAT3 cells after incubation with 0.5 μM and
1.0 μM imatinib for 48 h (Figure 6B). The results showed
p-STAT3 inhibitor synergizes with imatinib in CML cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that there was a striking
increase of STAT3 and RPS27a mRNA expression in bone
marrow samples from CML-AP/BP patients than that from
CML-CP. And there was a positive correlation between
the expression level of STAT3 and that of RPS27a. K562/
G01 cells expressed significantly higher levels of STAT3
and RPS27a compared with those of K562 cells. RPS27a
could be transactivated by p-STAT3 through the specific
p-STAT3-binding sites located nt −633 to −625 and nt
−486 to −478 in the RPS27a gene promoter in a dosedependent manner. RPS27a transactivated by p-STAT3
could inhibit the percentage of apoptotic CML cells to
imatinib.
RPS27a can perform extra-ribosomal functions.
RPS27a are overexpressed in mouse liver cancer and
some human tumors [34–36]. In previous study, we found
that RPS27a was highly expressed in CML-AP/BP and
imatinib resistant K562/G01 cells [31]. To explore the
mechanism of RPS27a up-regulation in the transition of
CML-CP to CML-AP/BP, We hypothesized that some
highly expressed proteins in imatinib resistant CML
cells contributed to the up-regulation of RPS27a gene.
We found that STAT3 might transactivate RPS27a gene

patients than that from CML-CP. And there was a positive
correlation between the expression level of STAT3 and
that of RPS27a. Then we detected the levels of STAT3,
p-STAT3 and RPS27a in K562 and K562/G01 cells. It was
found that K562/G01 cells expressed significantly higher
levels of STAT3, p-STAT3 and RPS27a compared with
those of K562 cells. Then we investigated the changes
of p-STAT3 and RPS27a expression after STAT3 was
overexpressed in HEK293T cells. We found that there was
a striking increase of p-STAT3 and RPS27a expression
as STAT3 was overexpressed in HEK293T cells. It was
implied that STAT3 could up-regulated the expression
of p-STAT3 and RPS27a. While upregulation of RPS27a
didn’t occur in HEK293T cells when the phosphorylation
of STAT3 was inhibited. It was implied that p-STAT3
played an indispensible role in the RPS27a up-regulation.
STAT3 plays a pivotal role in the hematopoietic
system [18]. The level of p-STAT3 in imatinib resistant
CML patients is higher than that in imatinib responsive

ones [17]. Combined STAT3 and BCR-ABL1 inhibition
induces synthetic lethality in therapy-resistant CML
[16, 37]. In the study, we explored the possible relationship
of p-STAT3 and RPS27a and their roles in CML cells.
To this end, we generated a serial of RPS27a luciferase
reporter gene constructs to analyze the trans-active
effect of p-STAT3 on RPS27a. Luciferase transcriptional
activity analysis showed that the luciferase activity of
the S934B containing site nt −633 to −625 and nt −486
to −478) fragments, S594B containing site nt −486 to
−478 fragment and S441P containing site nt −633 to
−625 fragment were up-regulated by co-transfected
pCMV5-STAT3 constructs. S934B luciferase activity
was up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner. And the
specificity of the DNA sequence was also verified by using
point-mutated luciferase reporter construct Mu934B. To
confirm the activation of RPS27a by p-STAT3. chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays were performed using K562/
G01 cells. The chromatin immunoprecipitation data

RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR
(qRT-PCR)

demonstrated the in vivo-specific binding of p-STAT3
to promoter of the RPS27a gene. These data suggested
that the STAT3/p-STAT3/RPS27a signal pathway might
participate the transition from CML-CP to CML-BP.
In previous study, we found that RPS27a promotes
inhibits the effect of imatinib on apoptosis of CML cell
lines [31]. In the study, we investigated the regulation of
STAT3/p-STAT3/RPS27a signal pathway on the effect
of imatinib on apoptosis of K562 cells. We found that
overexpression of STAT3 and p-STAT3 could inhibit the
percentage of apoptotic k562 cells by activation of RPS27a
and blocking the p-STAT3/RPS27a pathway significantly
increased the percentage of apoptotic K562-STAT3 cells
after incubation with imatinib. The results showed the
STAT3/p-STAT3/RPS27a pathway participated in the
regulation of chemosensitivity of CML cells to imatinib
treatment.
In conclusion, STAT3 and RPS27a mRNA
expression were up-regulated in the transition from CMLCP to CML-AP/BP. And there was a positive correlation
between the expression level of STAT3 and that of
RPS27a. RPS27a could be transactivated by p-STAT3
through the specific p-STAT3-binding site located nt −633
to −625 and −486 to −478 in the RPS27a gene promoter
in a dose-dependent manner. RPS27a transactivated by
p-STAT3 could inhibit chemosensitivity of CML cells to
imatinib. It appears that drugs targeting STAT3/p-STAT3/
RPS27a combining with TKI might represent a novel
therapy strategy in some patients with TKI resistant CML.

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent
treated with DNase I and 2 µg RNA was reverse-transcribed
using Superscript II RT following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Life technologies, USA). Primers for qRTPCR were designed using Primer premier software 5.0.
Human GAPDH primers used as an internal control
were 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ (forward)
and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ (reverse).
Human RPS27a primers were 5′-AGAAGAAGTCTTAC
ACCACTCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCCATAAACACCC
CAGC-3′ (reverse). Human STAT3 primers were 5′-CAGT
TTCTTCAGAGCAGGTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTGACT
CTTGAGGGTTTT-3′ (reverse). The qRT-PCR products
were 226 bp , 158 bp and 286 bp, respectively. The qRTPCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR kit (Takara,
Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions on the
ABI PRISM7500 real-time PCR system. Thermal cycling
conditions were 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of
5 s at 95°C, and 34 s at 60°C. The qRT-PCR reactions were
performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 2 µl of
sample cDNA, 0.2 µM of each primer.

Western blot
Total protein was extracted using RIPA lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
0.25% Na-desoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF, 25
mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM PMSF and 2 mg/ml Aprotinin).
Protein concentration was determined by the BCA
assay (Solarbio, China). The whole-cell lysates were
heat-denatured at 95°C for 5 min before run on 10%
SDS- PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with
each primary antibody, incubated in secondary antibody
and then detected with enhanced chemi-luminescence
detection reagent (Pierce, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Bone marrow samples were obtained from 20 CMLCP patients and 15 CML-AP/BP enrolled in Department
of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital,
Tongji University School of Medicine. Two bone marrow
samples were obtained from respective CP and BP of two
CML patients (One patient: 38-year-old, male, progressed
to AML. The other one: 45-year-old, female, progressed to
AML). All samples were collected under informed consent
of the subjects. The diagnosis and leukemia classification
were based on 2008 World Health Organization criteria.

Luciferase assay
The DNA sequence of 1.6-kb full-length human
RPS27a gene (FL-RPS27a) was from nt −1644 to −7 of
the promoter sequence of RPS27a. The DNA fragment
was cloned from the total DNA of K562 cells by PCR.
The primers were 5′-AGCCAAGATCTGCCAAGGTA-3′
(forward) and 5′-CACTCCTTAGTGTGACACGCTTT-3′
(reverse). After transfected by calcium phosphatemediated precipitation for 48 h, HEK-293 cells were
collected for assays of β-galactosidase and luciferase
activity according to the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 1000
Assay System Technical Manual (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) by luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

The cDNA sequence of RPS27a was obtained
from GenBank (NM_002954.5). A RPS27a-specific
targeting sequence was designed with the software
from Ambion. The target sequence for RPS27a was
5′-TTAGTCGCCTTCGTCGAGA-3′.
The
shRNA
expressing plasmid specifically targeting RPS27a
was cloned into pLKO-1 vector to obtain pLKOshRNA construct. A scramble shRNA sequence
(AATAGACTCAGCAAATGCG) with no homology to
any human gene was used as a negative control (scr).
For the production of lentivirus, HEK293T cells were
co-transfected with pLKO-shRNA or pLKO-scr and
pCMV, pMDG by Ca3(PO4)2 precipitation. Lentivirus
supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection, and
used to infect K562-STAT3 cells (termed as K562-STAT3RPS27a-sh and K562-STAT3-RPS27a-scr). Infected
cells were selected by puromycin 7 days after infection
for at least 2 weeks to obtain stable clones. Inhibition of
RPS27a expression was measured by qRT-PCR as well as
by Western blot using a rabbit anti-RPS27a monoclonal
antibody (abcam, UK).

This study was supported by Grants from the
National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.
81372391, 31271496, 81570190 and 81529001).
