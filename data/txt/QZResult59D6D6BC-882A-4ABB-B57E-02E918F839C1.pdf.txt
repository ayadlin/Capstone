Abstract

Author Manuscript

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide
with about 600,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Understanding the molecular pathways that
lead to HNSCC is crucial to identify new targets for anti-cancer drug development. Protein kinase
Cε (PKCε) is elevated in HNSCC and regulates the activation of Akt, Stat3, and Rho GTPases. To
date, the molecular mechanism of PKCε dysregulation in HNSCC remains to be elucidated. In
silico analysis identified three putative microRNA-107 (miR-107) binding sites in the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of PKCε. An inverse relationship was revealed between miR-107 and
PKCε in HNSCC cell lines. Delivery of miR-107 reduced PKCε levels in SCC15, SCC25, and
CAL27, three HNSCC cell lines with high PKCε and low miR-107. The activity of a luciferase
reporter construct containing the 3'-UTR of PKCε was down-regulated by miR-107 and mutations
in the three cognate miR-107 binding sites completely ablated the regulation by miR-107.
Treatment with miR-107 significantly blocked cell proliferation, DNA replication, colony
formation, and invasion in SCC25 and CAL27 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-resistant PKCε
was sufficient to partially rescue the loss-of-function phenotype in miR-107-overexpressing
SCC25 cells. Tumor growth in nude mice was retarded by 93 ± 7% in CAL27/miR-107 cells
compared to CAL27/miR-control cells. Lastly, human primary HNSCC tumors with elevated
PKCε had reduced miR-107 expression. Our results demonstrate that PKCε is directly regulated
by miR-107 and moreover, suggest that miR-107 may be a potential anti-cancer therapeutic for
HNSCC.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Approximately 600,000 new cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are
diagnosed worldwide each year (Kamangar et al, 2006; Leemans et al, 2011; Parkin, 2001).
Curative treatment is often achieved in patients presented with early-stage disease through
surgery or radiation. Palliative chemotherapy is the standard approach for patients with
recurrent/metastatic disease. The majority, greater than two-thirds, of HNSCC patients
present with locally advanced disease that requires a modern multi-disciplinary approach
involving surgery, radiation, and pharmacotherapy. However, patients with locally advanced
HNSCC frequently develop loco-regional recurrence and/or distant metastasis after
definitive treatment. The risk of failure is particularly high in patients with inadequate
resection margins, extra-nodal spread, or multiple lymph node involvement (Bonner et al,
2010). In these high-risk patients, primary surgery is often followed by adjuvant radiation
therapy. In spite of this intense treatment regimen, loco-regional recurrence occurs in about
30% of patients, distant metastasis occurs in about 25% of patients, and the five-year
survival rate is a dismal 40% (Laramore et al, 1992). Thus, a critical need remains to
identify and characterize genes that are responsible for promoting an aggressive HNSCC
phenotype prone to relapse and metastasis to allow for better clinical management.

Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine kinases known to play critical roles in
the signal transduction pathways involved in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and
migration (Aziz et al, 2010; Dempsey et al, 2000; Gutcher et al, 2003; Jaken and Parker,
2000). Published work showed that PKCα, ε, and ζ are dysregulated in HNSCC and
contribute to HNSCC development and/or progression. PKCζ was reported to control
EGFR-dependent proliferation of HNSCC cells (Cohen et al, 2006). A recent study showed
that PKCα down-regulates miR-15a to enhance DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in
HNSCC (Cohen et al, 2009). Moreover, elevated PKCα expression was found to be
associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC (Cohen et al, 2009). Our laboratory demonstrated
that PKCε is elevated in HNSCC and promotes an invasive and motile phenotype through
modulation of RhoA and RhoC GTPases (Pan et al, 2006). In primary HNSCC tumors,
PKCα, β, ε, γ, and ζ levels were shown to be elevated but only PKCε was found to be a
prognostic biomarker, even better than the traditional gold standard of TNM staging
(Martinez-Gimeno et al, 1995). This prospective study indicated that elevated PKCε is
significantly associated with an increase in disease recurrence and a decrease in overall
survival (Martinez-Gimeno et al, 1995).
It is clear that PKCε is elevated in HNSCC; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to
increased PKCε levels remain to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-107
directly regulates PKCε in HNSCC. An inverse association was found for miR-107 and
PKCε in HNSCC cell lines and tumor specimens. Over-expression of miR-107 decreased
PKCε levels and reduced the tumorigenic properties of HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo.

Moreover, enforced expression of miR-resistant PKCε partially reversed the loss-of-function
phenotype in miR-107-over-expressing HNSCC cells. Our work revealed a novel
mechanism for PKCε dysregulation in HNSCC and demonstrated miR-107 as a candidate
tumor suppressor in this patient population.

Results
Inverse association between miR-107 and PKCε in HNSCC cell lines

Author Manuscript

Our laboratory and others reported that PKCε is elevated in HNSCC (Cohen et al, 2006;
Martinez-Gimeno et al, 1995; Pan et al, 2006). However, the molecular mechanism of this
observation remains to be elucidated. Several miRs were predicted by TargetScan to bind to
the 3'-UTR of PKCε suggesting that miRs may be a negative regulator of PKCε. We focused
our initial experiments on miR-103a and miR-107 since both miRs have three putative
binding sites in the 3'-UTR of the PKCε gene. As shown in Figure 1, three HNSCC cell
lines, SCC15, SCC25, and CAL27, have significantly elevated PKCε protein levels and
reduced miR-107 expression compared to primary keratinocytes. In contrast, the level of
miR-103a, which has the same seed sequence as miR-107, was variable in the three HNSCC
cell lines (Figure 1C). Compared to primary keratinocytes, miR-103a expression was higher
in SCC15, unchanged in SCC25, and lower in CAL27. These results provide evidence to
demonstrate an inverse association between miR-107 and PKCε in HNSCC.
PKCε is a target of miR-107

To further provide evidence that miR-107 regulates PKCε, HNSCC cells were transiently
transfected with pre-miR-control or pre-miR-107 (50 nmol/L for 48 hours). Transfection
with pre-miR-107 enhanced the expression of mature miR-107 by 329 ± 8-fold, 386 ± 4fold, and 227 ± 11-fold in SCC15, SCC25 and CAL27 cells, respectively (p<0.001). In
comparison to pre-miR-control, delivery of pre-miR-107 resulted in a dramatic decrease in
PKCε levels in SCC15, SCC25, and CAL27 cells confirming that PKCε is a target of
miR-107 (Figure 2A). Next, we determined if miR-107 directly binds to their predicted sites
in the 3'-UTR of PKCε to control PKCε levels. In silico analysis with TargetScan, identified
three putative miR-107 binding sites in the 3'-UTR of PKCε located at nucleotides 27–33
(Site 1), 1517–1523 (Site 2), and 1564–1570 (Site 3). CAL27 cells were co-transfected with
pre-miR-control or pre-miR-107 and a reporter expression vector containing wildtype or
mutant 3'-UTR of PKCε cloned downstream of a luciferase gene (Figure 2C). pre-miR-107
blocked luciferase activity by 55 ± 2% (p<0.01) in cells transfected with the full-length
wildtype 3'-UTR of PKCε. Mutations in one of the three miR-107 sites dampened the
inhibitory effect of pre-miR-107 on luciferase activity; 38 ± 2% inhibition for mutant 1, 32 ±
4% inhibition for mutant 2, and 30 ± 3% inhibition for mutant 3. Interestingly, pre-miR-107
had no effect on luciferase activity in cells transfected with the 3'-UTR of PKCε containing
mutations in all three miR-107 sites (Mut 1–-3). Our work confirmed that miR-107 regulates
PKCε through direct binding in the 3'-UTR of the PKCε mRNA and moreover, optimal
suppression of PKCε requires occupation of all three miR-107 sites.

miR-107 reduces the tumorigenic potential of HNSCC in vitro and in vivo

Author Manuscript

Our previous work demonstrated that PKCε plays a critical role in promoting an aggressive
phenotype in HNSCC (Pan et al, 2006). Since miR-107 was sufficient to dramatically
reduced PKCε levels, the anti-cancer effects of miR-107 on HNSCC cells were assessed. As
shown in Figure 3, cell proliferation, DNA replication, colony formation, and cell invasion
were determined in SCC25 and CAL27 cells following treatment with pre-miR-control or
pre-miR-107 (50 nmol/L). Cell proliferation was reduced in SCC25 cells by 20 ± 2%
(p<0.01) and in CAL27 cells by 28 ± 2% (p<0.01) following pre-miR-107 treatment. premiR-107 blocked DNA replication and colony formation by 72 ± 5% and 70 ± 3% in SCC25
cells and 67 ± 3% and 45 ± 6% in CAL27 cells, respectively (p<0.01). Treatment with premiR-107 inhibited cell invasion by 93 ± 5% in SCC25 cells and 84 ± 8% in CAL27 cells
(p<0.01).

Stable polyclonal miR-control or miR-107 over-expressing CAL27 cells were implanted in
athymic nude mice to determine the effect of miR-107 on in vivo tumorigenicity (Figure 4).
In Figure 4A, CAL27/miR-107 cells had a dramatic increase in miR-107 expression
compared to CAL27/miR-control cells (p<0.005). The levels of PKCε and two other
confirmed miR-107 targets, hypoxia inducible factor 1-β (HIF1-β) and cyclin-dependent
kinase 6 (CDK6), were decreased in miR-107 over-expressing CAL27 cells. Interestingly,
Dicer1, a confirmed miR-107 target in breast cancer, was unchanged in CAL27/miR-107
cells compared to CAL27-miR-control cells. Compared to anti-miR-control transfection,
primary keratinocytes transfected with anti-miR-107 (PK/anti-miR-107) had lower mature
miR-107 expression (70 ± 1% inhibition, p<0.001). Importantly, PK/anti-miR-107 cells
demonstrated an increase in PKCε, HIF1-β, and CDK6 protein levels providing further
evidence that miR-107 is a key regulator of these genes (Figure 4C). Tumor growth was
significantly reduced in the mice implanted with CAL27/miR-107 cells compared to
CAL27/miR-control cells. Mice bearing CAL27/miR-control tumors had a mean tumor
volume of 1691 ± 455 mm3 at 6 weeks post-implantation. In contrast, CAL27/miR-107 cells
were less tumorigenic and had a mean tumor volume of 108 ± 39 mm3 (p<0.005, n=7).
Moreover, mean tumor weight was significantly lowered by 93 ± 2% in CAL/miR-107
tumors compared to CAL27/miR-control tumors (p<0.005, n=7). Importantly, PKCε protein
levels were dramatically lower in tumors from CAL27/miR-107 cells than in tumors from
CAL27/miR-control cells. Taken together, these results indicate that down-regulation of
PKCε by miR-107 is an effective approach to suppress the tumorigenicity of HNSCC in
vitro and in vivo.
miR-resistant PKCε reverses the anti-tumorigenic effects of miR-107

Author Manuscript

In addition to targeting PKCε, other groups have reported that miR-107 directly regulates
HIF1-β and CDK6 (Feng et al, 2011; Lee et al, 2009; Yamakuchi et al, 2010). To provide
direct evidence that down-regulation of PKCε is required for the anti-tumorigenic effects of
miR-107, miR-resistant PKCε was over-expressed in miR-107 expressing SCC25 (SCC25/
miR-107) cells to determine if restoring PKCε would be sufficient to rescue the miR-107
loss-of-function phenotype. SCC25/miR-107 cells were transfected with a wild type PKCε
expression or empty vector without the 3'-UTR of PKCε. In Figure 5A, the SCC25/
miR-107/PKCε cells had the proper genetic alterations and had elevated PKCε levels in a

high miR-107 background. Empty vector-transfected SCC25/miR-107 cells had minimal
effect on cell phenotype as these cells maintained their miR-107 loss-of-function defect
compared to SCC25/miR-controls cells. Importantly, ectopic over-expression of PKCε
partially rescues the defect of SCC25/miR-107 cells and resulted in a significant increase in
cell proliferation (p<0.005), DNA replication (56 ± 8%, p<0.005), colony formation (130 ±
18%, p<0.005), and cell invasion (392 ± 39%, p<0.005) compared with SCC25/miR-107/
empty cells. These results reveal that the tumor-suppressive actions of miR-107 are, at least,
partially through modulation of PKCε levels.
miR-107 is reduced and inversely associated with PKCε in primary HNSCC tumors

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our studies with HNSCC cell lines demonstrated an inverse association between miR-107
expression and PKCε protein levels. Next, we examined miR-107 and PKCε expression in
primary tumors and matched normal adjacent epithelium from previously untreated HNSCC
patients by qPCR. As shown in Figure 6A, a majority (12/17) of HNSCC patients had
significantly lower miR-107 expression in the tumor compared to normal tissue. A 37.5%
reduction in miR-107 expression in the tumor compared to the normal tissue was
demonstrated for this patient cohort (p<0.008, n=17); mean miR-107 expression was 0.005
± 0.0008 for the primary HNSCC tumors and 0.008 ± 0.0007 for the adjacent normal
epithelium. These observations are consistent and further support our results demonstrating
that miR-107 has tumor suppressive actions in HNSCC. In this cohort, four patients were
found to have significantly higher PKCε expression in their primary tumor compared to
normal adjacent epithelium. All four patients with high PKCε were part of the cohort of
twelve patients with reduced miR-107 expression in the tumor. We were unable to
determine PKCε protein levels in this population due to insufficient and/or unavailable
patient specimen. Since miRs are known to regulate mRNA stability and translation,
assessment of PKCε protein may reveal additional patients in the low miR-107 population
with elevated PKCε levels in the tumor. Nonetheless, even with this small sample size,
miR-107 expression was found to be significantly lower (73 ± 13% reduction, p<0.01) in
patients with high PKCε expression than in patients with low PKCε (Figure 6C). Our results
demonstrate that miR-107 is reduced in HNSCC tumors and associated with elevated PKCε
expression in HNSCC.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

miRs are short (20–25 nucleotides) single stranded noncoding RNAs that play a critical role
in the regulation of global gene expression. miRs negatively regulate target protein levels by
suppressing gene mRNA translation and/or enhancing gene mRNA degradation (Filipowicz
et al 2008). Published work has clearly shown that miRs are involved in the regulation of
different signaling pathways including cellular differentiation, proliferation, migration and
apoptosis (Avissar et al, 2009; Calin and Croce, 2006; Croce, 2009; Datta et al, 2008;
Hwang and Mendell, 2006; Liu et al, 2009; Nasser et al, 2008). Thus, it is not surprising that
aberrant expression of certain miRs is associated with cancer development and progression,
including HNSCC (Avissar et al, 2009; Calin and Croce, 2006; Croce, 2009; Datta et al,
2008; Hwang and Mendell, 2006; Liu et al, 2009; Nasser et al, 2008). In the present study,
our results revealed that miR-107 is under-expressed and functions as a tumor suppressor in

HNSCC. Ectopic expression of miR-107 is sufficient to dampen the tumorigenic potential of
HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. PKCε was confirmed as a direct target of miR-107 and
had an inverse relationship with miR-107. Our study indicates that suppression of miR-107
leads to an increase in PKCε resulting in the development of HNSCC.

Author Manuscript

Consistent with our work, other groups have reported that miR-107 functions as a tumor
suppressor in bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancer. miR-107 was dramatically reduced in
bladder carcinoma in situ compared to normal bladder (Ayala de la Pena et al, 2011). An
inverse association between miR-107 and HIF1-β was demonstrated in human colon cancer
specimens (Yamakuchi et al, 2010). Over-expression of miR-107 inhibits HIF1-β levels and
retards tumor growth in HCT116 colon cancer cells (Yamakuchi et al, 2010). Enforced
expression of miR-107 in pancreatic cancer cells, MiaPACA-2 and PANC-1, repressed
CDK6 levels and inhibited cell proliferation (Lee et al, 2009). In contrast, several reports
have shown that miR-107 functions as an oncogene in breast and gastric cancer. Elevated
miR-107 levels were associated with distant metastasis and poorer clinical outcome in breast
cancer (Martello et al, 2010). Over-expression of miR-107 in MCF10A mammary epithelial
cells promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition resulting in a highly metastatic
phenotype thorough modulation of Dicer1 (Martello et al, 2010). In line with this report,
knockdown of miR-107 leads to an increase in Dicer1 and inhibition of cell invasion and
migration in gastric cancer cells (Li et al, 2010). Taken together, these results indicate that
the biology of miR-107 is complex and highly cell-type dependent.

Author Manuscript

Our data showed that CDK6 and HIF1-β levels are decreased whereas Dicer1 levels were
unchanged in CAL27/miR-107 cells compared to CAL27/miR-control cells. This indicates
that miR-107 target genes are not regulated in concert and raises the possibility that other
factors, including additional genetic alterations, may dictate which set of miR-107 targets is
regulated in a particular cell type. Moreover, it is possible that down-regulation of Dicer1
may be a prerequisite for miR-107 to function as an oncogene instead of a tumor suppressor.
Expression of miR-resistant PKCε was sufficient, at least partially, to rescue the loss-offunction phenotype observed for SCC25/miR-107 cells. This key observation indicates that
a critical event for the tumor suppressive actions of miR-107 in HNSCC is to negatively
control the levels of PKCε.

Author Manuscript

Global miR expression analysis showed that miR-107 was significantly down-regulated in
HNSCC tumors compared to matched normal tissue (Wong et al, 2008). In addition, miR
expression profiling between 18 HNSCC cell lines and oral keratinocytes indicate that
miR-107 is decreased at high frequency in HNSCC (Kozaki et al, 2008). Our work showed
that a majority (12/17) of HNSCC patients have reduced miR-107 expression in the primary
tumor and thus, provide additional support that loss of miR-107 is a frequent event in the
development of HNSCC. In this cohort, HNSCC patients with high PKCε mRNA
expression had a dramatic 73% reduction in miR-107 expression compared to patients with
low PKCε mRNA expression. This observation is in line with our in vitro results and
provide further evidence that miR-107 is inversely associated with PKCε in HNSCC.
In summary, our results showed that miR-107 functions as a tumor suppressor in HNSCC
through regulation of PKCε. Reconstitution of miR-107 is sufficient to retard the

tumorigenicity of HNSCC cells. Our study indicates that reduction in miR-107 expression is
a pathogenetic event in HNSCC and suggests that miR-107 may be a potential anti-cancer
therapeutic for this patient population.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture

Author Manuscript

Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SCC15, SCC25, and CAL27)
were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). CAL27 cells were cultured in DMEM medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. SCC25 and SCC15 cells were grown in DMEM/F12
(1:1) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary keratinocytes were obtained from
ATCC and cultured in EpiLife medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with Ca2+
and other growth factors in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. SCC15, SCC25, and CAL27 cell
lines were authenticated using short tandem repeat profiling (ATCC).
Generation of transient and stable cell lines

Author Manuscript

Transient miR-107 and miR-control overexpressing SCC15, SCC25, and CAL27 cells were
generated by transfection with pre-miR-107 or pre-miR-control (50 nmol/L) using
Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were harvest after 48 hours for gene expression, protein levels,
and functional assays. Stable CAL27/miR-107, CAL27/miR-control, SCC25/miR-107 and
SCC25/miR-control were generated by transduction using shMIMIC miR-107 or miRcontrol lentiviral particles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells were incubated
with viral particles (MOI=1:20) mixed with polybrene (at a final concentration of 10μg/ml)
for 12 hours. Subsequently, cells were cultured in complete growth media for 72 hours and
polyclonal populations were selected with 1μg/ml puromycin. SCC25/miR-107 cells were
transiently transfected with an empty vector or a PKCε expression vector (Ex-A1280-MO2;
GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells
were harvested after 48 hours for protein levels and functional assays. Primary keratinocytes
were transiently transfected with anti-miR-control or anti-miR-107 (100 nmol/L) using
Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were harvested after 48 hours for gene expression and protein
levels.
Real-time PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated from HNSCC cells and primary keratinocytes with TRIzol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Expression of PKCε, GAPDH, mature miR-103a, mature
miR-107, and RNU44 were determined using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast RealTime PCR System with validated TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). PKCε expression was normalized to GAPDH and mature miR-103a/
miR-107 expression was normalized to RNU44 using the ΔΔCt method.
Luciferase reporter assay
Wildtype or mutant PKCε-3′UTR psiCHECK-2 plasmid was transiently transfected into
H293T cells. Cells were transfected with 50 ng of psiCHECK-2 along with pre-miR-107 or
pre-miR-control (100 nmol/L) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After
48 hours, cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in the lysis buffer (100 mM potassium

phosphate pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), and measured for Firefly/
Renilla luciferase activities in a luminometer using the Dual-Light System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Renilla luciferase activities were normalized to Firefly
luciferase activities to control for transfection efficiency.
Western blot analysis
Whole cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli loading buffer, boiled, separated by SDSPAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Subsequently, immunoblot analyses
were performed using antibodies specific to PKCε (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), CDK6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), HIF1-β (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA),
Dicer1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology). The signal was
developed with ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after incubation with appropriate secondary
antibodies.

Cell invasion and proliferation
Cell invasion was determined as described from the cell invasion assay kit (BD Biosciences,
Bedford, MA). Cells were harvested and resuspended in serum-free medium. An aliquot (1
× 105 cells) of the prepared cell suspension was added into the chamber and incubated for 24
hours at 37°C in a 10% CO2 tissue culture incubator. Non-invading cells were gently
removed from the interior of the inserts with a cotton-tipped swab. Invasive cells were
stained and counted. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT reagent to detect
metabolic active cells (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Nutley, NJ). Absorbance was
measured at 570nm in the Spectra Max 190 ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA) after overnight incubation.

Tumor growth in nude mice

Cells (500) were plated in complete growth media and allowed to grow until visible colonies
formed (10–12 days). Cell colonies were fixed with cold methanol, stained with 0.25%
crystal violet in 25% methanol, washed and air dried.
DNA replication
Cells (10,000 cells per well) were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to grow for 24 hours.
Subsequently, cells were incubated with serum-free media for 16 hours and then incubated
with complete growth media containing 1 μCi of 3H-thymidine for 6 hours. Cells were
washed with PBS and 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured using a Hitachi
scintillation counter.

CAL27/miR-control or CAL27/miR-107 cells (1×106 cells) were implanted into the flanks
of nude mice (6–8 weeks). After two weeks, tumors were measured once a week using a
digital caliper and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula d1×d2×d3×0.5236,
where d represents the three orthogonal diameters. In addition, tumors were resected and
weighed at the end of the 6-week study protocol. Whole cell lysates were extracted from
tumor tissues and determined for PKCε protein levels.

Analysis of primary HNSCC tissues

Author Manuscript

Seventeen primary tumors were collected at The Ohio State University James Cancer
Hospital from HNSCC patients at the time of surgical resection between 1997 and 2000. All
tissues were diagnosed histologically as HNSCC by a board certified pathologist. Written
informed consent, as required by the institutional review board, was obtained from all
patients. Collected samples were stored immediately in liquid nitrogen at −80°C until
analysis. Total RNA was isolated from the frozen tumors with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Expression of PKCε, GAPDH, mature miR-107, and RNU44 were determined using
the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System with validated TaqMan gene
expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PKCε and mature miR-107
expression were normalized to GAPDH and RNU44, respectively, using the ΔΔCt method.
