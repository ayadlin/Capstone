Abstract
The FGFR1 is a therapeutic target under investigation in
multiple solid tumors and clinical trials of selective tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) are underway. Treatment with a single
TKI represents a logical step toward personalized cancer therapy, but intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms limit
their long-term beneﬁt. In this study, we deployed RNAi-based
functional genomic screens to identify protein kinases controlling the intrinsic sensitivity of FGFR1-dependent lung cancer
and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) cells to
ponatinib, a multikinase FGFR-active inhibitor. We identiﬁed
and validated a synthetic lethal interaction between MTOR and
ponatinib in non–small cell lung carcinoma cells. In addition,
treatment with MTOR-targeting shRNAs and pharmacologic
inhibitors revealed that MTOR is an essential protein kinase

in other FGFR1-expressing cancer cells. The combination of
FGFR inhibitors and MTOR or AKT inhibitors resulted in
synergistic growth suppression in vitro. Notably, tumor xenografts generated from FGFR1-dependent lung cancer cells exhibited only modest sensitivity to monotherapy with the FGFRspeciﬁc TKI, AZD4547, but when combined with the MTOR
inhibitor, AZD2014, signiﬁcantly attenuated tumor growth and
prolonged survival. Our ﬁndings support the existence of a
signaling network wherein FGFR1-driven ERK and activated
MTOR/AKT represent distinct arms required to induce full
transformation. Furthermore, they suggest that clinical efﬁcacy
of treatments for FGFR1-driven lung cancers and HNSCC may
be achieved by combining MTOR inhibitors and FGFR-speciﬁc
TKIs. Cancer Res; 75(20); 4398–406. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

therapeutics is an ongoing subject of intense investigation and
sets the stage for strategies to deploy inhibitors of the resistance
mechanisms following treatment failure of the initial drug.
Thus, "serial monotherapy" has emerged as a logical approach
in clinical oncology for solid tumors, including lung cancer. In
this regard, however, it is important to review the lessons
learned from acquired resistance to antimicrobial and antiviral
monotherapy over the past 60 years (reviewed in ref. 12). The
present strategy to combat acquired resistance to monotherapy
in cancer by deploying sequential therapies to block emergent
resistance pathways (i.e., MET inhibitors after resistance to
EGFR-speciﬁc TKIs) failed as a strategy to cure TB and HIV
infections.
Importantly, therapeutic success in HIV and TB infections was
only achieved when combinations of inhibitors were deployed
that induced rapid and synergistic suppression of the infectious
agent at the onset of therapy, thereby preventing the emergence of
drug resistance (12). We hypothesize that the development of
rational, mechanism-based combinations of inhibitors that
simultaneously inhibit multiple elements within transforming
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) coactivation networks (14) active
in cancer cells may achieve a similar impact on cancer cure or
control. In this study, we deployed functional genomics screens
with a kinome-targeting shRNA library to identify auxiliary pathways that co-signal with FGFR1 in lung cancer and HNSCC cell
lines. Our studies establish MTOR as a protein kinase with
essential properties in some FGFR1-dependent cancer cell lines
as well as auxiliary, synthetic lethal (SL) properties in the context
of FGFR inhibitors in other cell lines. In sum, our ﬁndings identify

Our studies and those of others demonstrate that overexpressed, nonmutated FGFR1 participates as an oncogenic driver
via autocrine FGFs in cell lines derived from lung cancers of all
histologies (1–5), head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCC; refs. 6, 7) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (8).
As a result, multiple early-phase clinical trials of FGFR-targeting
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are now under way, including a
study of the multikinase TKI ponatinib (9) in lung cancer at our
institution (NCT01935336).
The clinical efﬁcacy of FGFR TKIs as single anticancer agents
is not fully realized. Yet, the problem of intrinsic and acquired
resistance to TKI monotherapy has emerged as a major limitation to long-term control or cure of solid tumors (10–13) and
portends similar difﬁculties with single FGFR TKIs as therapeutics. Deﬁning mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted

FGFR1 and MTOR Coinhibition Synergistically Suppresses Growth

MTOR as a protein kinase that contributes to the intrinsic sensitivity of cancer cells to FGFR TKIs such that combined treatment
with MTOR inhibitors and FGFR TKIs elicits synergistic growth
inhibition. Thus, direct MTOR kinase inhibitors are attractive
agents to consider combining with FGFR-speciﬁc TKIs for treatment of FGFR1-dependent lung cancers and HNSCCs.

Cell proliferation assay. Cells were plated at 100 cells per well in
96-well tissue culture plates and treated with inhibitors at
various doses. When the DMSO-treated control wells became
conﬂuent (1,2, weeks), cell numbers were assessed using a
CyQUANT Direct Cell Proliferation Assay (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Materials and Methods

Xenograft tumor studies. H1581 and Colo699 cells were suspended in 50% Matrigel/PBS at 10 million cells per mL and 1
million cells were injected s.c. in both ﬂanks of female nu/nu mice
according to protocols approved by the University of Colorado
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). When at
least one of the tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3, the mice
were randomized into treatment groups (n ¼ 9,10/group) of
diluent control (1% Polysorbate 80), AZD4547 (12.5 mg/kg),
AZD2014 (10 mg/kg) or both AZD4547 and AZD2014. Drugs
were delivered daily by oral gavage (0.25 mL/mouse). Peak
plasma levels of AZD4547 following similar dosing are approximately 1 to 2 mmol/L (15). Also, a total Cmax of 11 mmol/L (free
Cmax of 0.51 mmol/L) is achieved 30 minutes after a single 10 mg/
kg dose of AZD2014 (S. Cosulich, AstraZeneca; unpublished
data). Tumor volumes were determined by caliper measurements
of the long and short diameter performed twice per week using the
modiﬁed ellipsoid formula for volume, V ¼ 1/2(length  width2).
Mice were euthanized when tumors reached a volume greater than
2 cm3 or they exhibited signs of morbidity speciﬁed in the IACUC
protocol.

Cell culture
All cancer cell lines used in this study were submitted to
ﬁngerprint analysis by the University of Colorado Cancer
Center DNA Sequencing and Analysis Core to conﬁrm their
authenticity. Cell lines were routinely cultured in RPMI-1640
growth medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS with
1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 C in a
humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator.
Lentivirus preparation
The Human Kinase TRC shRNA library (obtained from the
Functional Genomics Shared Resource within the University of
Colorado Cancer Center) was packaged in 293T cells as follows.
293T cells were incubated overnight at 37 C in a 5% CO2
humidiﬁed incubator with Turbofect transfection reagent, 5.0 mg
pD8.9, 5.0 mg pCMV-VSV-G and 3.0 mg kinome library. The viruscontaining media from the 293T cells was then ﬁltered through a
0.45-mm ﬁlter after adding 1 mg/mL polybrene and either used
immediately as described or stored at 4 C until ready for use. In
experiments where MTOR was validated as an essential or SL
kinase, two MTOR shRNAs in the pLKO.2 lentiviral vector
(TRCN0000332888 and TRCN0000363722) distinct from those
shRNAs included in the library or an shRNA-targeting GFP as a
negative control were packaged with the pCMV-VSV-G and pD8.9
component vectors. The virus was titered on NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts
and the effect on cell growth was measured by clonogenic growth
assay as described previously.
Functional genomics screens
For details on functional genomics screens, see Supplementary
Information.
In vitro and in vivo growth assays
Clonogenic and anchorage-independent growth assays. To measure
the effect of inhibitors or shRNA-mediated knockdown on cell
growth, cells were seeded at 100 cells per well in 6-well tissue
culture plates in full media. After 24 hours, cells were treated as
indicated and cultured for 14 days with the addition of fresh
media containing inhibitors every 7 days. Plates were rinsed
twice with PBS, ﬁxed, and stained with a solution of 0.5% (w/v)
crystal violet in 6.0% (v/v) gluteraldehyde for 30 minutes at
room temperature. Plates were rinsed in distilled H2O and
photographed. For measurement of anchorage-independent
growth in soft agar, 20,000 cells were suspended in 1.5 mL
media and 0.35% noble agar and overlaid on base layers
containing 1.5 mL media and 0.5% noble agar in 6-well plates.
Wells overlaid with 2 mL media containing drugs were fed once
a week and allowed to grow for 14 to 21 days. Viable colonies
were stained for 24 hours with 250 mL 1 mg/mL nitroblue
tetrazolium. Digital photographs of both clonogenic and soft
agar wells were used to quantify total colony area by Metamorph imaging software (Molecular Devices).

times in TTBS, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature
with alkaline phosphatase–coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies. The ﬁlters were developed using Luminata Classico substrate (Millipore Corporation) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. When blotting phosphorylated proteins, the ﬁlters were stripped and probed for the corresponding total
signaling enzyme level or Na/K-ATPase a-subunit (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.) as a loading control.

Results
A functional genomics-based SL screen with a kinome shRNA
library identiﬁes MTOR as a collaborator with FGFR1
Our recent studies demonstrate through molecular and pharmacologic approaches an autocrine role for nonmutated FGFR1
in multiple cancers, including lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma, and HNSCC (1,2,6,8). On the basis of precedent from
monotherapy with TKIs in other oncogene-driven lung cancers,
including those bearing mutant EGFR or rearranged ALK
(10,11,13), intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms are
predicted to limit the clinical response of FGFR inhibitors as well.
To screen for signal pathways whose activity reduces intrinsic
sensitivity of lung cancer cell lines to FGFR inhibitors, we performed functional genomics-based SL screens with a kinometargeting shRNA library (see Materials and Methods) and lung
cancer cell lines exhibiting high sensitivity (Colo699, H520, and
H1703) and moderate/low sensitivity (H1299 and H157) to
ponatinib (Table 1; ref. 2). Although ponatinib is a multikinase
inhibitor with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 to 8 nmol/L on ABL
and SRC family kinases, FGFR1, 2 and 4, PDGFRs, VEGFRs and
RET (16), our recent studies in lung cancer and mesothelioma cell
lines indicate that sensitivity to the TKI is closely associated with
FGFR1 expression and function (2,8). The cell lines were transduced with lentiviruses encoding the kinome-targeting shRNAs in
the pLKO.1 vector at a multiplicity of infection <1. Following
selection for puromycin resistance, which eliminates nontransduced cells and cells expressing an shRNA-targeting an essential
gene, the cells were treated with or without ponatinib for 3 days
followed by an additional 3 days of culture in medium lacking the
drug. The shRNAs were ampliﬁed from genomic DNA by PCR and
submitted to massively parallel deep sequencing, and the reads
were analyzed by BiNGS!SL-seq (17) to determine the count
frequency of the individual shRNAs in the control and treated
samples. Kinase genes that are SL with respect to ponatinib
treatment are deﬁned herein by signiﬁcantly decreased shRNA

counts in the treated samples with at least two independent
shRNAs.
The functional genomics analysis identiﬁed MTOR as the topranking SL hit in both H157 and H1299 cells, but not in the more
ponatinib-sensitive H520 and H1703 cells (Supplementary Table
S2) or Colo699 cells (data not shown). To validate MTOR as an SL
gene with respect to ponatinib in H157 and H1299 cells, lentiviral-encoded shRNAs distinct from those used in the kinome
shRNA library were transduced into H157 and H1299 cells. As
shown in Fig. 1A, both MTOR-targeting shRNAs reduced MTOR
protein levels relative to a nonsilencing control shRNA-targeting
GFP. Although MTOR silencing, alone, exerted little or no effect
on clonogenic growth of H157 or H1299 cells, enhanced growth
inhibition by ponatinib upon MTOR knockdown was observed in
both cell lines (Fig. 1B-D). Finally, treatment of H157 cells with
ponatinib and the MTOR inhibitor, AZD8055 (18), yielded
signiﬁcantly greater clonogenic growth inhibition than ponatinib
alone (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results validate MTOR as an
SL gene with ponatinib.
MTOR is an essential gene in multiple FGFR1-dependent cancer
cell lines
MTOR was not identiﬁed as an SL protein kinase in H520,
H1703, or Colo699 cells (Supplementary Table S2 and data not
shown). Because the SL screen format (see Supplementary Fig. S1)
eliminates shRNAs targeting essential kinases due to the selection
for stable puromycin resistant cells, it is possible that MTOR
shRNAs were eliminated from the transduced cell population in
Colo699, H520, and H1703 cells. We performed an essential
kinase screen in FGFR1-dependent Colo699 lung adenocarcinoma cells and FGFR1-dependent 584-A2 HNSCC cells (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). The count frequency of
multiple MTOR shRNAs was determined 2 and 7 days after
transduction by sequencing of ampliﬁed shRNAs and the results
are presented graphically in Fig. 2A. Five of six independent
MTOR-targeting shRNAs were eliminated from the pool of recovered shRNAs in Colo699 cells 7 days after transduction. By
contrast, none of the six shRNAs were eliminated from 584-A2
cells after 7 days of incubation. Thus, the results are consistent
with an essential role of MTOR in Colo699 cells, but not 584-A2
cells. The essential function of MTOR in Colo699 cells was further
validated with two shRNA distinct from those used in the kinome
library where strong reduction of clonogenic growth resulted from
transduction of MTOR shRNAs relative to the GFP-targeting
shRNA control (Fig. 2B).

sensitivities of the cell lines to the FGFR inhibitor, AZD4547, and the MTOR inhibitor, AZD8055, were determined with clonogenic or anchorage-independent growth
assays using drug concentrations from 0 to 1 mmol/L. The sensitivity of the cell lines to AZD2014 was measured using cell proliferation assays and the CyQUANT
reagent over drug concentrations from 0 to 1 mmol/L. The primary data for AZD8055 sensitivity on six of the cell lines are shown in Fig. 2C and the IC50 values were

Validation of MTOR as a synthetic lethal gene with FGFR inhibition by RNAi-mediated knockdown. A, H157 and H1299 cells were transduced with either a
negative control shRNA-targeting GFP or one of two independent MTOR targeting shRNAs (TRCN0000363722 or TRCN0000332888), henceforth abbreviated
as MTOR 22 and MTOR 88, respectively. Cells were selected for resistance to puromycin and resulting colonies were harvested and immunoblotted for MTOR
protein levels. The protein level of the a-subunit of Na/K-ATPase was measured as a loading control. B, as in A except H157 cells were treated with 300 nmol/L
ponatinib or DMSO at the time of puromycin selection. Resulting colonies were stained with crystal violet and photographed. A representative well of three
replicates is shown. Mean total colony area ( SEM, n ¼ 3) for the indicated shRNA transductions and ponatinib treatments were quantiﬁed as described in
Materials and Methods, and the data are graphically presented for H157 (C) and H1299 (D) cells, respectively.

As a pharmacologic approach to deﬁne the relative requirement
of MTOR for growth and survival in FGFR1-dependent cancer cell
lines, clonogenic cell growth was measured in a panel of cell lines
in the presence of increasing concentrations of AZD8055.
AZD8055, and the congener, AZD2014 are highly selective for
MTOR in either the TORC1 or TORC2 complexes, with little
activity on other members of the phosphatidylinositol kinase
superfamily (18). In clonogenic/anchorage-independent growth
assays, H157 and 584-A2 cells exhibited low sensitivity (IC50 >
600 nmol/L) and H1299 cells intermediate sensitivity (IC50 180
nmol/L) to AZD8055 (Fig. 2C; Table 1). By contrast, Colo699,
H520, and H1703 as well as the FGFR1-dependent lung cancer
cell line, H1581, and the HNSCC cell line, CCL30, were uniformly
sensitive to AZD8055 with IC50 values <80 nmol/L. This rank
order of sensitivity among the cancer cell lines to AZD8055 was
conﬁrmed with a cell proliferation assay (Supplementary Fig. S4)
and was similar to that observed with AZD2014 (Table 1). The
panel of cell lines was very sensitive to the TORC1-speciﬁc
inhibitor, rapamycin, although little or no difference in relative
sensitivity between the cell lines was observed with IC50 values
ranging from 0.3 to 2 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S5). Together,
the studies indicate that FGFR1-dependent lung cancer and
HNSCC cell lines exhibit variable degrees of MTOR dependency
for growth and survival and explain the observation that MTOR
was not identiﬁed as SL with ponatinib in Colo699, H520, and
H1703 cells because it exerts an essential function in these cell
lines relative to H157 and H1299 cells.
Synergistic growth inhibition by FGFR and MTOR inhibitors in
Colo699 and H1581 cells
Despite the range of MTOR dependencies measured in the
panel of cancer cell lines, we tested whether FGFR and MTOR

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibitors might still yield additive or synergistic growth inhibition in cell lines even when MTOR exhibits an essential phenotype. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, combination treatment
with either ponatinib or AZD4547, a speciﬁc FGFR1,2,3 inhibitor
(15), and AZD8055 resulted in signiﬁcantly greater clonogenic
growth inhibition relative to FGFR inhibitor, alone, in Colo699,
H1703, and H520 cells. To rigorously test for synergistic growth
inhibition resulting from simultaneous blockade of FGFR1 and
MTOR, FGFR1-dependent lung cancer cell lines (H1581 and
Colo699) or an HNSCC cell line (CCL30) exhibiting high sensitivity to AZD8055 (Table 1) were treated in a 96-well plate
format (see Materials and Methods) with multiple concentrations
of AZD4547, alone and in combination with the MTOR inhibitor,
AZD8055. The effects on cell growth measured by the CyQUANT
assay are shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S7, and analysis
of the resulting data by the method of Chou and Talalay (19)
revealed synergistic growth inhibition over multiple concentrations of the two drugs. The greater than additive growth inhibition
by combined AZD4547 and AZD8055 was conﬁrmed with the
distinct MTOR inhibitor, AZD2014 (18), in H1581, Colo699, and
584-A2 cells (Fig. 4) and with rapamycin and AZD4547 in
Colo699 and H1581 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). Thus, the
identiﬁcation of MTOR as an SL pathway with FGFR1 is observed
pharmacologically in multiple FGFR1-dependent cancer cell
lines.
To explore the mechanism by which simultaneous inhibition
of FGFR1 and MTOR yield synergistic growth inhibition, the
activity of signaling pathways known to be regulated by these
protein kinases was monitored by immunoblot analyses.
Figure 5A reveals that AZD4547 inhibited ERK phosphorylation,
but had little or no effect on phosphorylation of the TORC2 site
(S473) of AKT in H1581 and Colo699 cells. In addition, none of

AZD4547 and MTOR inhibitors, AZD2014, alone and combined on growth of H1581 and Colo699 cells. H1581, Colo699, and 584-A2 cells were submitted to anchorageindependent growth assays with 100 nmol/L (H1581) or 300 nmol/L (Colo699, 584-A2) AZD4547 with or without 100 nmol/L AZD2014. After 14 to 21 days,
viable colonies were stained with NBT and total colony area was measured as described in Materials and Methods. The data were normalized to DMSO control
treatments and are the means and SEM (n ¼ 3), where    , P < 0.0001;    , P < 0.001.

TORC1 and TORC2, consistent with the functioning of an RTK
coactivation network (14) in which MTOR is regulated in parallel,
not distal to FGFR1. These results are also observed with rapamycin and AZD4547 except that no inhibition of AKT Ser473
phosphorylation is observed (Supplementary Fig. S9). Dual
blockade of FGFR1 and MTOR, but not inhibition of either target
alone, induced PARP1 cleavage in H1581 cells as measured by
immunoblot analysis, suggesting the induction of apoptosis with
the combination inhibitor treatment (Fig. 5B). As an independent
biochemical measure of apoptosis, the activity of caspase-3 was
assayed in extracts from H1581 cells similarly treated. Figure 5C
shows an approximately 5-fold increase in caspase-3 activity in
cells treated with combined AZD4547 and AZD8055 relative to
control cells or cells treated with the single agents.
It is noteworthy that neither AKT1, 2, nor 3 were identiﬁed as
high-ranking hits in the SL screens (Supplementary Table S2),
despite the ﬁndings in Fig. 5 showing marked inhibition of AKT
phosphorylation by MTOR kinase inhibitors. It is possible that
functional redundancy occurs among the distinct AKT gene products such that silencing of any one AKT gene fails to exert a
phenotype. We tested the ability of two AKT inhibitors, MK2206
(20) and GSK690693 (21) to exert synergistic growth inhibition
with FGFR inhibitors. The sensitivity of Colo699 cells to these AKT
inhibitors is shown in Supplementary Fig. S10A and indicates
only modest sensitivity to the single agents. As shown in Supplementary Figs. S10B and S11, strong synergy of MK2206 and
ponatinib in Colo699 cells and GSK690693 and ponatinib in
H1581 cells was observed. Thus, the ﬁndings in Figs. 3–5 and
Supplementary Figs. S10 to S11 support the parallel activation of
the MTOR–AKT signaling pathway as a modulator of the intrinsic
sensitivity of multiple FGFR1-dependent cancer cell lines to FGFR
TKIs.
Enhanced tumor growth inhibition by combination AZD4547
and AZD2014 in ﬂank xenograft assays
H1581 and Colo699 cells were implanted in the ﬂanks of
female nu/nu mice as described in Materials and Methods. When
the tumors reached approximately 100 mm3, the mice were
randomized into treatment groups; diluent control, AZD4547
(12.5 mg/kg), AZD2014 (10 mg/kg), or the combination of both

drugs. As shown in Fig. 6B and C, treatment of ﬂank H1581
tumors with either AZD4547 or AZD2014 alone yielded little
growth inhibition relative to diluent control (Fig. 6A). In fact, the
modest effect of AZD4547 monotherapy is surprising, considering the potency with which this cell line is inhibited by AZD4547
in vitro (Fig. 3 and Table 1). However, in combination, AZD4547
and AZD2014 yielded signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition (Fig.
6D and E) and signiﬁcantly prolonged survival (Fig. 6F), consistent with the synergistic growth inhibition observed in vitro.
Similar relative activities of AZD4547 and AZD2014 as monotherapies, and in combination were observed following treatment
of ﬂank Colo699 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S12A–S12F),
although the survival beneﬁt afforded by the combination therapy was not statistically signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.06).

Discussion
Using an unbiased RNAi screen, our study highlights MTOR as
an actionable protein kinase that can be targeted in combination
with FGFR1 to achieve synergistic growth inhibition in FGFR1dependent cancer cell lines. The molecular basis for the synergism
appears to involve the collapse of a greater signaling network by
the combination therapy than that achieved by either FGFR1 or
MTOR inhibition alone. The ﬁndings in Fig. 5 support the
dominant regulation of the ERK pathway downstream of FGFR1
and activation of TORC1 targets (p70S6K and S6) and TORC2
targets (pAKT S473) by MTOR. Moreover, this rationally derived
combination of MTOR inhibitors with FGFR inhibitors is consistent with an extensive literature demonstrating beneﬁt of adding MTOR inhibitors to various targeted therapeutics. For example, a rapamycin analogue increased growth inhibition by ponatinib in FGFR2-driven endometrial cancer cell lines (22), and
combining a dual PI3K–MTOR inhibitor with TKIs active on BCRABL yielded increased growth inhibition of CML cell lines (23).
Combination of a BTK inhibitor with the MTOR inhibitor,
AZD2014, induced synergistic killing of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells (24), and the beneﬁt of combining IGF inhibitors
with MTOR inhibitors for reducing growth of Ewing sarcoma cell
lines has been documented (25). The generality of the synergistic
growth suppression achieved with addition of MTOR inhibitors

Signal pathway inhibition and apoptosis induction by AZD4547 and AZD8055 alone, and in combination. A, H1581 and Colo699 cells were incubated with 0.1%
DMSO as a control, AZD4547 (300 nmol/L), AZD8055 (100 nmol/L), or the combination of the two drugs for 2 hours as described in Materials and Methods.
Cell extracts were prepared and submitted to immunoblot analyses for the indicated signaling intermediates. Phospho-AKT (S473) is a measure of TORC2 activity
whereas phospho-p70S6K (T389), phospho-S6 (S235/236), and phospho-Rictor (T1135) are measures of activity through the TORC1 pathway. The ﬁlters were
stripped and reprobed for total ERK, AKT, p70S6K, S6, and Rictor to ensure equal loading of cell protein in each lane. B, H1581 cells were treated for 3 days
with 0.1% DMSO as a control, AZD4547 (300 nmol/L), AZD8055 (100 nmol/L), or the combination of the two drugs. Cell extracts were prepared and
submitted to immunoblot analysis of PARP1 and the a-subunit of the NaK-ATPase as a loading control. The cleavage product of PARP1 is indicated. C, cell
extracts from H1581 cells treated 3 days with 0.1% DMSO, AZD4547 (300 nmol/L), AZD8055 (100 nmol/L), or the combination of the two drugs were
submitted to a caspase-3 enzymatic assay as described in Materials and Methods. The data are the initial rates of the assays in triplicate determinations.
Caspase-3 activity in combination-treated cells is signiﬁcantly different (   , P < 0.0005) from activity in either monotherapy-treated extracts.

indicates the degree to which MTOR participates in cancer signaling networks.
The identiﬁcation of MTOR as an SL protein kinase in the
setting of ponatinib treatment of H157 and H1299 cells as well as
the ability of AZD8055 and AZD2014 to synergize with AZD4547
in Colo699 and H1581 cells supports a model where MTOR
signals in parallel with, not downstream of FGFR1. In this regard,
our results are consistent with the existence of RTK coactivation
networks as reviewed by Xu and Huang (14) where the ERK
pathway distal to FGFR1 and MTOR represents distinct fragile
points. The ability of the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, to synergize
with the MTOR inhibitor, AZD8055, supports this hypothesis
(26). The identiﬁcation of receptors or RTKs that reside upstream
of MTOR in FGFR1-dependent cancer cells remains to be deﬁned.
Also, MTOR exists within two distinct signaling complexes,
TORC1 and TORC2 (27) and the identity of the precise complex
mediating the SL, and essential activities measured in our study
were not resolved. The kinome shRNA library lacked shRNAs to
Raptor and Rictor that would distinguish TORC1 and TORC2 and
speciﬁc silencing of Rictor or Raptor yielded equivocal results
(data not shown). A likely scenario is that both complexes
participate in growth regulation in lung and HNSCC cells and
clearly, both TORC1 and TORC2 are inhibited by AZD8055 and

4404 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

AZD2014 (18). Also, rapamycin strongly inhibited growth (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S8), supporting the critical involvement
of TORC1. It is noteworthy that AKT1, 2, or 3 were not highranking hits in the screens, although redundancy among the three
gene products could preclude identiﬁcation of any with our RNAibased approach. Like MTOR inhibitors, two independent AKT
inhibitors synergized with ponatinib for growth inhibition of
multiple cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S10 and S11), providing
support for AKT as at least one important target of MTOR in these
cancer cells.
In light of the potent in vitro sensitivity of Colo699 and
H1581 cells to FGFR TKIs (Figs. 3 and 4), we were surprised by
the modest degree of growth inhibition achieved with
AZD4547 alone when these cell lines were propagated as ﬂank
xenografts in nu/nu mice (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S12).
Still, this degree of growth inhibition is not inconsistent with
the early results of clinical trials of AZD4547 and BGJ398 in
squamous cell lung cancer where only partial responses have
been observed thus far in less than 20% of patients (28,29). On
the basis of our present studies showing strong in vivo responses
with ﬂank xenografts that are limited to combination treatment
with AZD4547 and AZD2014, we wonder whether targeting
auxiliary pathways such as MTOR will be required to observe

signiﬁcant clinical responses in FGFR1-dependent lung cancers
and HNSCCs. If so, it is important that FGFR1 not be immediately
abandoned as a therapeutic target in these settings based solely on
a marginal clinical response to FGFR TKI monotherapy. Although
the frequent and profound tumor shrinkage responses observed in
lung cancers bearing mutant EGFR or rearranged ALK treated with
TKI monotherapies have established a new expectation for clinical
responsiveness, we hypothesize that cancers driven by nonmutated drivers like FGFR1 may inherently depend more on RTK
coactivation networks for full-transforming potential (14).
Admittedly, clinical investigation of combination therapies is
unwieldy relative to monotherapy and bears increased concern
of drug toxicity. Still, the fact that many lung cancers and the
majority of HNSCC will present with nonmutated oncogene
drivers necessitates careful consideration of combination therapies as a starting point in treatment design.
