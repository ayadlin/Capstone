Abstract
Administration of a combination of yeast-derived B-glucan
with antitumor monoclonal antibodies (mAb) has significant
therapeutic efficacy in a variety of syngeneic murine tumor
models. We have now tested this strategy using human
carcinomas implanted in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice. Combined immunotherapy was
therapeutically effective in vivo against NCI-H23 human non–
small-cell lung carcinomas, but this modality was surprisingly
ineffective against SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinomas.
Whereas NCI-H23 tumors responded to this combination
therapy with increased intratumoral neutrophil infiltration
and C5a production, these responses were lacking in treated
SKOV-3 tumors. Further results suggested that SKOV-3 tumors
were protected by up-regulation of the membrane complement regulatory protein CD55 (decay-accelerating factor).
Blockade of CD55 in vitro led to enhanced deposition of C
activation product C3b and increased cytotoxicity mediated
by B-glucan–primed neutrophils. In vivo, administration of
anti-CD55 mAb along with B-glucan and anti–Her-2/neu mAb
caused tumor regression and greatly improved long-term
survival in animals bearing the previously resistant SKOV-3
tumors. This was accompanied by increased intratumoral
neutrophil accumulation and C5a production. We conclude
that CD55 suppresses tumor killing by antitumor mAb plus
B-glucan therapy (and, perhaps, in other circumstances).
These results suggest a critical role for CD55 to regulate iC3b
and C5a release and in turn to influence the recruitment of
B-glucan–primed neutrophils eliciting killing activity. [Cancer

Introduction
Antitumor monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy holds great
promise as a targeted anticancer therapeutic approach and
has become more widely used in clinical practice (1, 2). The
mechanisms by which antitumor mAbs inhibit or kill tumor cells
are diverse and may include inhibition of growth factor receptor
function, antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity, and complementdependent cytotoxicity. Antitumor mAbs can also effect the
delivery of cytotoxic payloads such as radioisotopes. Complement-

dependent cytotoxicity has not been thought to play a crucial
role in the antitumor effect elicited by most antitumor mAbs due
to overexpression of membrane C regulatory proteins (mCRP) on
most tumor cells. However, most therapeutic chimeric or humanized
mAbs are of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype and can
effectively activate C, resulting in C3b deposition and subsequent
formation of the opsonin iC3b on the surface of tumor cells.
Furthermore, iC3b on tumor cells engages complement receptor 3
(CR3; CD11b/CD18, aMh2 integrin, Mac-1) on the surface of effector
cells, eliciting CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in the presence of
the yeast cell wall h-glucan (3, 4). Our previous studies have shown
that dual occupancy of CR3 by iC3b and h-glucan leads to the
activation of Syk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway in
phagocytic cells (5). Moreover, C activation results in the release of
the chemotactic factors such as C3a and C5a, which can recruit
effector cells including natural killer (NK) cells and granulocytes into
the tumor.
h-Glucans are glucose polymers derived from a variety of plants
and microorganisms. Yeast-derived h-glucans are long polymers of
h(1,3) glucose, with 3% to 6% of the backbone glucose units
possessing a h(1,6) branch (6). Previous studies have shown
significant therapeutic efficacy of yeast-derived h-glucan when it
is coadministered with antitumor mAbs or naturally occurring
antitumor antibodies in a variety of syngeneic murine tumor
models (5, 7–10). In addition, barley h-glucan synergizes with
humanized antitumor mAbs for cancer therapy in xenograft
models (11–13). These emerging data clearly show that h-glucans
can enhance the efficacy of antitumor mAb therapy and suggest
that the mAb/h-glucan combination might be clinically effective.
In animal models, tumor regression and enhanced survival
mediated by h-glucan immunotherapy require serum C3 and
granulocyte CR3 (7, 8). There is also evidence that in the antitumor
effects, neutrophils are the predominant effector cells (8).
Moreover, neutrophil recruitment was shown to be dependent on
leukotriene B4–amplified C5a-mediated chemotaxis (10). In
addition, poly-(1,6)-h-D-glucopyranosyl-(1,3)-h-D-glucopyranose
(PGG) h-glucan has shown direct effect on neutrophil chemotaxis
in vivo and also up-regulates neutrophil chemotaxis toward C5a
(14, 15). Together, these studies support a pivotal role for C
activation and neutrophil chemotaxis in combined mAb/h-glucan
immunotherapy.
Membrane complement regulatory proteins inhibit C activity at
different stages such as inhibition of C3 or C5 convertase formation or blockade of membrane attack complex formation. Upregulation of mCRPs on most human carcinomas indicates that
circumvention of C-mediated tumoricidal activity or tumor
surveillance may be one of the mechanisms of tumor evasion

(16). These molecules include CD46 (membrane cofactor protein),
CD55 (decay-accelerating factor), and CD59. CD46 promotes C3b
and C4b inactivation by factor I whereas CD59 prevents formation
of the membrane attack complex. CD55 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein and plays a critical role in
adaptive T-cell immunity (17, 18). CD55 inhibits C activation via
displacement of C2a from C4b and of Bb from C3b, thereby
interfering with the function of C3 and C5 convertase in both the
classic and alternative pathways (19). This activity has a
significant effect not only on C3b/C5b-initiated progression of
C activation but also on the local release of chemotactic factors
C3a and C5a.
Here, we hypothesized that inhibition of mCRPs could add to
the efficacy of combined h-glucan and antitumor mAb therapy
because both C activation and C-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis
are required for its therapeutic efficacy. This study reaffirms a
critical role for mCRPs in limiting C-dependent antitumor effector
mechanisms and has identified mCRP inhibition as a means to
enhance h-glucan and antitumor mAb immunotherapy. Moreover,
this study identifies that blockade of CD55 enhances h-glucan–
mediated CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at two stages: iC3b
deposition on tumor cells and recruitment of CR3+ neutrophils
primed with h-glucan.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and therapeutic B-glucan. Antihuman CD46-FITC (E4.3)
was purchased from GeneTex, Inc. Antihuman CD55-FITC (1A10), biotinlabeled antimouse C5a (I52-1486), purified anti-C5a antibody, and
appropriately labeled isotype controls were purchased from BD PharMingen. Antimouse and antihuman C3-FITC antibodies were purchased from
Cappel. Biotin-labeled antimouse Gr-1 mAb (RB6-8C5) was purchased from
eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Blocking antihuman CD46 mAb (J4.48) was
purchased from Chemicon. Anti-CD55 hybridoma (HD1A) was generously
provided by Dr. Harris (Cardiff University Complement Biology Group,
Cardiff, United Kingdom; ref. 20). The humanized mAb against Her-2
(Herceptin) was produced by Genentech and anti–epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) antibody was produced by ImClone Systems, Inc.
Therapeutic soluble PGG h-glucan was obtained from Biothera, Inc.
Preparation of F(ab¶)2 fragment of anti-CD55 mAb (HD1A). The
F(ab¶)2 fragment of anti-CD55 mAb was prepared with Pierce ImmunoPure*
F(ab¶)2 Preparation Kit. In brief, anti-CD55 mAb was incubated with
immobilized pepsin and undigested fragments were removed by protein A
chromatography. The products were confirmed by reduced and nonreduced
PAGE gel.
Mice and tumor models. Fox Chase ICR severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were purchased from Taconic. Pilot experiment showed
that these mice do not have any defect on the complement system.
The murine tumor therapy protocols were done in compliance with all
guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Louisville. For the SKOV-3 xenograft model,
6- to 8-week-old SCID mice were implanted s.c. in a mammary fatpad with
10  106 SKOV-3 cells. When a palpable tumor was observed, animals were
divided into groups (n = 7) and given the humanized anti–Her-2 mAb
(0.2 mg i.v. every third day) with or without soluble PGG h-glucan (1.2 mg
i.v. every third day). PBS-treated and PGG only–treated animals served as
controls. For the NCI-H23 xenograft model, the similar protocol described
above was used except the therapeutic mAb. In this model, the humanized
anti-EGFR mAb (0.15 mg i.v. every third day) was used. In experiments
with combined anti-CD55 mAb with anti–Her-2/neu antibody and PGG
h-glucan, animals were divided into groups (n = 8 or 9) and received
treatment with anti-CD55 (0.2 mg i.v. every third day), with or without anti–
Her-2/neu antibody plus PGG h-glucan. Therapy was continued for up to
4 weeks, during which tumor measurements by calipers were calculated as
the average of perpendicular diameters twice weekly. Mice were sacrificed

when tumors reached 12 mm in diameter. In some experiments, survival
was monitored up to 100 or 150 days beyond tumor implantation.
Immunohistochemical staining of tumors for neutrophils and C5a.
Tumors were excised and snap-frozen in tissue freezing medium (optimum
cutting temperature compound, Sakura Finetechnical Co., Ltd.). Tissue
blocks were cut and fixed with cold acetone. To detect tumor-infiltrating
neutophils or released C5a, the sections were blocked with 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) buffer and incubated with an avidin/biotin blocking
kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and then stained with anti–Gr-1-biotin or
anti-C5a-biotin for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with
blocking buffer, the sections were stained with streptavidin-horseradish
peroxidase (Southern Biotechnology Associates) for 1 h at room temperature. After additional washes, horseradish peroxidase substrate (Vector
Laboratories) was added for 30 min at room temperature. Following
additional three washes, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The number of infiltrating neutrophils was calculated as the mean of
the number of Gr-1–positive cells in 10 representative high-power fields
(total magnification, 400).
mCRP expression on tumor cells. For in vitro cell staining, SKOV-3 or
NCI-H23 cells were harvested and Fc receptors were blocked by incubation
with anti-CD32/CD16 mAb. The cells were then stained with anti-CD46FITC or anti-CD55-FITC mAbs and then were analyzed by flow cytometry.
For tumor staining, SKOV-3 or NCI-H23 tumors were excised and sectioned.
After blocking with 3% BSA/PBS, sections were stained with anti-CD46FITC or anti-CD55-FITC mAbs. Images were acquired by fluorescence
microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE300 confocal cell images).
Detection of C activation. To determine whether the therapeutic
antibodies can activate mouse or human C, mouse or human serum was
freshly collected and kept in an ice bath. For every million tumor cells,
100-AL volume of diluted mouse (1:4) or human (1:10) serum containing
10 Ag/mL working dilution of therapeutic mAbs was used. In some
experiments, human C5-depleted sera (Quidel) were used to avoid cell
killing during the process. Tumor cells were mixed and incubated at 37jC
for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold flow cytometry staining
buffer and the tumor cell pellet was resuspended in 100 AL of diluted
detecting antibody (goat anti-mouse or anti-human C3-FITC). Cells were
incubated on ice for 30 min, washed twice as above, and propidium iodide
was used to exclude the dead cells. For the C deposition on tumor cells after
anti-CD46 and anti-CD55 mAb blockade, tumor cells were incubated with
10 Ag/mL anti-CD46 or intact anti-CD55 mAb or the F(ab¶)2 fragment of
anti-CD55 mAb, respectively, for 1 h on ice before serum was added.
In vitro h-glucan–mediated cellular cytotoxicity assay. In vitro
cytotoxicity of SKOV-3 cells by h-glucan–primed human neutrophils was
analyzed using a real-time measure of the impedance of electrical current
by viable target cells adhered to a conductor on the bottom of wells in a 16well plate (Acea Biosciences) according to manufacturer’s instruction (21)
and our previous publication (5).
Measurement of C5a level in serum. Sera from different groups in
SKOV-3 xenograft model were collected after the last treatment and were
measured for C5a by ELISA. The purified rat anti-mouse C5a was used as a
capture antibody and was paired with biotinylated anti-mouse C5a as the
detection antibody. Recombinant mouse C5a protein was used as a
standard.
Statistical analysis. Data from mouse therapy protocols were entered
into Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software) to generate graphs of tumor regression
or survival and to determine the significance of differences between data
sets. Student’s t test was used to compare differences between two tumor
regression curves, whereas the log-rank test was used to determine the
significance of differences between two survival curves.

Results
Combined B-glucan and antitumor mAb therapy for the
treatment of human ovarian carcinoma and human non–
small-cell lung carcinoma. To facilitate translation of h-glucan/
mAb therapy from preclinical models to clinical application, two
human xenograft models were established in SCID mice. SKOV-3 is

a human ovarian carcinoma cell line that expresses high levels of
Her-2/neu and the human non–small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
cell line NCI-H23 expresses abundant EGFR. Both cell lines form
solid tumors when implanted s.c. in SCID mice.
Preliminary in vitro studies showed that both humanized anti–
Her-2/neu antibody (trastuzumab) and anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) are able to activate mouse C leading to iC3b deposition on
tumor cell surfaces (data not shown). Several pilot studies were
carried out to titrate the inoculums of s.c. SKOV-3 and NCI-H23
required to produce a palpable tumor within f7 to 10 days and
this was found to be 10  106 cells for both lines. Furthermore,
in vivo titration of anti–Her-2/neu mAb and anti-EGFR mAb
indicated that administration of 0.2 mg (anti–Her-2/neu) or 0.15
mg (anti-EGFR) mAbs i.v. twice a week resulted in detectable iC3b
on the surface of excised tumors 6 days later.
Based on these preliminary findings, groups of mice were
implanted with 10  106 SKOV-3 or NCI-H23 cells and randomized
to receive either 0.2 mg trastuzumab or 0.15 mg cetuximab i.v.
twice a week or mAb i.v. in combination with 1.2 mg soluble PGG
h-glucan i.v. twice a week or 1.2 mg PGG h-glucan only or PBS
control. As indicated in Fig. 1A, anti–Her-2/neu monotherapy
failed to achieve a significant reduction in tumor burden (P = 0.175,
versus no treatment). In addition, combined therapy with soluble
PGG h-glucan and anti–Her-2/neu antibody failed to cause
significant tumor regression compared with treatment with mAb
alone (P = 0.45). However, combined therapy was able to achieve a
reduction in tumor growth compared with nontreated animals

(P = 0.0025). Despite this reduction in tumor growth rate, the
animals receiving combined therapy were not observed to have
enhanced survival (Fig. 1B).
Mice implanted with NCI-H23 human NSCLC that received antiEGFR mAb alone also did not exhibit significant tumor regression
with respect to nontreated animals (P = 0.177). However, animals
receiving combination therapy with PGG h-glucan, in addition to
anti-EGFR mAb, displayed significant tumor regression compared
with animals receiving mAb alone or untreated PBS control
(Fig. 1C). More importantly, animals receiving combined therapy
were also observed to have significantly enhanced survival, with
80% of mice surviving >150 days after tumor implantation (Fig. 1D).
Neutrophil infiltration and C5a release in tumors. Our
previous studies indicated that neutrophils are the predominant
effector cells in h-glucan immunotherapy (8, 10). To determine
whether the difference in observed therapeutic efficacy between
the two different human carcinomas was due to differences in the
presence and/or activity of effector cells, tumors from animals
in both protocols were excised for immunohistochemical staining.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils
showed a relative paucity of Gr-1+ cells in SKOV-3 tumors
(Fig. 2A). In contrast, massive neutrophil infiltration was observed
in NCI-H23 tumors (Fig. 2A). The number of infiltrating Gr-1+
neutrophils in SKOV-3 tumors was much less than that in NCIH23 tumors (Fig. 2B), suggesting that SKOV-3 tumors had likely
established an immunosuppressive mechanism against the influx
of phagocytes.

Figure 2. SKOV-3 tumors show a paucity
of infiltrating neutrophils and decreased
C5a release as compared with NCI-H23
tumors. Tumor masses from SCID tumorbearing mice treated with humanized
anti–Her-2/neu or anti-EGFR antibody,
as described in Fig. 1, were cryosectioned
and stained with anti–Gr-1 mAb or anti-C5a
mAb. A, poor neutrophil infiltration was
observed in SKOV-3 tumors and massive
neutrophil infiltration was observed in
NCI-H23 tumors. B, quantitative summary
of the neutrophil infiltrate measured as

representative high-power fields. C, a lack
of C5a was observed in SKOV-3 tumors
whereas abundant C5a was exhibited in
NCI-H23 tumors. Representative tumor

specimens. Original magnification,

C activation by naturally occurring tumor antitumor antibodies
or exogenous antitumor mAbs not only targets tumor cells with
covalently bound iC3b but also releases the chemotactic factors
C3a and C5a. Neutrophils express more C5aR (CD88) than C3aR.
Our previous results showed that chemotaxis of granulocytes into
tumors is mediated by C5a but not by C3a (10). Because many
fewer neutrophils were observed in SKOV-3 tumors with respect to
NCI-H23 tumors, we hypothesized that C5a release might be
blocked in SKOV-3 tumors. To test this, both SKOV-3 and NCI-H23
tumors were stained for C5a. Indeed, C5a production was
significantly lower within SKOV-3 tumors with respect to NCIH23 tumors (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data suggest that
therapeutic failure of h-glucan and antitumor mAb in SKOV-3
tumors is due to the loss of C5a-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis
into the tumors.
Overexpression of mCRPs on SKOV-3 tumors prevents
effective B-glucan/mAb immunotherapy. It has been shown
that the C activation cascade is regulated by mCRPs in plasma or
on the cell surface, functioning in normal conditions to prevent
uncontrolled C activation. Overexpression of mCRPs by human
tumors has been widely reported (16) and may be an important
cause of diminished C5a production in tumors. CD46 can promote
inactivation of C3b and C4b by factor I ( forming iC3b and C4d,
respectively) whereas CD55 displaces Bb from C3b and C2a from
C4b, thereby interfering with C3 and C5 activation. Together, CD46
and CD55 play an important role in controlling C3b deposition,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

iC3b formation, and C5a release, events which are critical for
h-glucan–mediated immunotherapy. SKOV-3 and NCI-H23 cells
were assayed for the expression of the mCRPs CD46 and CD55. As
shown in Fig. 3A, SKOV-3 cells overexpress both mCRPs and
display a 1- to 1.5-log shift in staining intensity by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis compared with cells stained with a
control mAb. In contrast, NCI-H23 cells express lesser amounts of
CD46 and CD55. To confirm this difference, both tumor types were
excised and stained with fluorescent-labeled anti-mCRPs. As shown
in Fig. 3B, SKOV-3 tumors exhibited much stronger CD46 and CD55
expression compared with NCI-H23 tumors.
These results suggested that blocking mCRPs on SKOV-3 cells
might lead to augmented C3 activation and iC3b deposition on
tumors. Neither anti-CD46 nor anti-CD55 mAb activated human or
mouse C (Fig. 4A and data not shown), indicating that detected
iC3b was the result of C activation by antitumor mAb. Inhibition of
CD55 with neutralizing mAb enhanced the deposition of either
human or mouse C3b mediated through C activation by anti–Her2/neu antibody (Fig. 4B). To further confirm that anti-CD55 mAb
is a blocking mAb rather than a C-activating mAb, the F(ab¶)2
fragment of anti-CD55 mAb was generated. As shown in Fig. 4C,
the F(ab¶)2 fragment of HD1A mAb and the intact IgG similarly
enhanced iC3b-deposition on SKOV-3 tumor cells mediated by
anti–Her-2/neu antibody (Fig. 4C). In addition, CD55 neutralization
also significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of iC3b-opsonized SKOV-3
cells mediated by h-glucan–primed neutrophil effector cells

(Fig. 4D). However, blocking CD46 had minimal effect on C3b
deposition on target cells and did not promote h-glucan–primed
neutrophil–mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity (Fig. 4D).
Inhibition of CD55 in conjunction with combined B-glucan
and antitumor mAb immunotherapy significantly reduces
tumor burden and leads to long-term survival. Having shown
that CD55 suppresses both C3 activation and h-glucan–mediated
CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vitro, we explored the
therapeutic efficacy of in vivo blockade of CD55 with neutralizing
mAb along with h-glucan/mAb therapy in SKOV-3 tumors. In this
xenograft model, groups of mice with palpable SKOV-3 tumors
received (a) no treatment (PBS injections), (b) anti–Her-2/neu
alone, (c) anti-CD55 mAb alone, (d) both mAbs, (e) anti-CD55 mAb
with PGG h-glucan, ( f ) anti–Her-2/neu antibody with PGG
h-glucan, or (g ) anti–Her-2/neu antibody + anti-CD55 mAb +
PGG h-glucan. After 3 weeks of therapy, mice with anti–Her-2/neu
antibody, PGG h-glucan alone, anti-CD55 mAb alone, anti-CD55
mAb + anti–Her-2/neu antibody, or anti-CD55 mAb + PGG hglucan did not have statistically smaller tumors than PBS-treated
control mice (Fig. 5A and data not shown). However, mice
receiving PGG h-glucan in addition to anti–Her-2/neu antibody
exhibited a significantly reduced tumor burden compared with
untreated animals but not statistically significant compared with
anti–Her-2/neu–treated animals, comparable to the data presented in Fig. 1. Strikingly, mice receiving anti-CD55 mAb in

addition to combined h-glucan therapy had significantly smaller
tumors compared with combined h-glucan therapy. More importantly, 80% of these mice achieved long-term survival (Fig. 5B).
These data suggest that the addition of anti-CD55 mAb to combined
h-glucan immunotherapy in SKOV-3 tumors significantly enhances
the regression of the SKOV-3 tumors and long-term survival
compared with treatment with h-glucan and anti–Her-2/neu
antibody alone.
Increased neutrophil accumulation and C5a release in
SKOV-3 tumors by inhibition of CD55. As shown in Fig. 2,
SKOV-3 tumors had markedly decreased neutrophil infiltration and
detectable C5a within tumors. To determine whether inhibition of
CD55 would enhance C5a production thereby stimulating neutrophil influx into tumors, SKOV-3 tumors treated with different
regimens were excised and immunohistochemical analysis was
done. Consistent with previous observations, there was a marked
absence of infiltrating neutrophils in animals treated with PBS,
anti-CD55 only, anti–Her-2/neu antibody only, or combined PGG
h-glucan and anti–Her-2/neu antibody (Fig. 6A). However, massive
neutrophil infiltration was observed in animals receiving anti-CD55
mAb in addition to combined h-glucan/antitumor mAb therapy
(Fig. 6A and B). Similarly, significantly more C5a was detected
in the animals treated with anti-CD55 in addition to combined
h-glucan immunotherapy (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the serum C5a
level was significantly lower in animals receiving anti-CD55 mAb

treatment compared with animals without anti-CD55 mAb therapy
(Fig. 6D), perhaps reflecting enhanced intratumoral C activation.
Thus, blockade of CD55 by neutralizing mAb overcomes the
immunosuppressive microenvironment established by SKOV-3
tumors, leading to phagocyte influx to tumors.

Discussion
Using two human xenograft tumor models, we have found that
mCRP (in particular, CD55) is capable of suppressing effective
immunotherapy involving administration of h-glucan and antitumor mAbs. Whereas this regimen was quite effective in

treatment of NCI-H23 human NSCLC xenografts, similar xenografts
of SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinoma cells were very resistant
to therapy. The latter seems to be due to elevated expression of
CD55 on SKOV-3 cells, thus inhibiting C3 and C5 convertase
activity and interfering with C3a and C5a release. Ultimately,
decreased C5a results in decreased infiltration of h-glucan–primed
neutrophils into the tumor microenvironment. In support, we find
that inhibition of CD55 with neutralizing mAb significantly
enhances iC3b deposition on SKOV-3 cells and elicits strong
h-glucan–mediated CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vitro.
Significant therapeutic efficacy of h-glucan/mAb administration in
SKOV-3 tumors was achieved on coadministration of anti-CD55
mAb. Blockade of CD55 leads to enhanced intratumoral C5a
deposition, increased neutrophil accumulation, tumor regression,
and improved long-term survival.
The failure of combined h-glucan–mediated immunotherapy in
SKOV-3 tumors was initially thought to be due to loss of Her-2/neu
expression in vivo. However, freshly isolated SKOV-3 cells uniformly
expressed similar levels of Her-2/neu as compared with in vitro
cultured cells (data not shown). Both anti–Her-2/neu antibody
and anti-EGFR antibody are chimeric antibodies that have been
engineered in the human IgG1 framework, and therefore should
activate C. However, the reported mechanism of action of trastuzumab is the inhibition of the formation of Her-2 heterodimers
and internalization of the receptor (22, 23). Thus, blockade of
Her-2 heterodimer formation via anti–Her-2/neu antibody is
associated with decreased cell proliferation. There was no marginal
benefit observed in animals treated with PGG h-glucan alone or
h-glucan in combination with anti–Her-2/neu antibody with
respect to antibody alone–treated animals. These data seem to
confirm previous reports that the mechanism of action of
trastuzumab is independent of immune effector functions including
complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. In a similar manner, cetuximab blocks its ligand
binding to EGFR, Her-1, inhibiting cancer cell cycle progression and
inducing tumor cell apoptosis (24). The shown therapeutic efficacy
in NCI-H23 carcinoma using h-glucan in combination with antiEGFR mAb suggests that the C system can be manipulated in such a
way as to elicit effective antitumor immune responses. In addition,
both anti–Her-2/neu and anti-EGFR mAbs are capable of activating
mouse and human C, leading to iC3b deposition on tumor cells
(data not shown). Therefore, the observed failure of h-glucan–and

anti–Her-2/neu antibody–mediated immunotherapy for Her-2–
overexpressing xenografts was not hypothesized to be an intrinsic
fault of the mAb or h-glucan. Rather, it was hypothesized that
the tumor microenvironment was inhibiting immunotherapy with
h-glucan and antitumor mAb. Indeed, infiltration of neutrophils,
the most important effector cells in h-glucan immunotherapy, was
drastically decreased in SKOV-3 xenografts. In contrast, massive
neutrophil infiltration was observed in NCI-H23 tumors. Thus, a
fundamental difference between these two xenograft models was
the potency of immunosuppression mediated by these two different
human tumors.
To address the role of immune suppression mediated by the
SKOV-3 tumor microenvironment, we sought to explore possible
mechanisms by which SKOV-3 tumors block the influx of
neutrophil to the tumor. C5a is a potent neutrophil chemotactic
factor (25). Thus, it is not surprising to observe decreased C5a
within SKOV-3 tumors, given the paucity of infiltrating neutrophils
relative to the NCI-H23 tumors. C activation is regulated by a
number of regulatory proteins that prevent unchecked C activation
and possible autoimmunity. Indeed, suppression of mCRPs is
known to exacerbate the development of autoimmune diseases
(26–28). Therefore, it was hypothesized that C regulatory proteins
may play a critical role in the regulation of C5a release in tumor
microenvironment. Most tumor cells overexpress variable levels
of mCRPS including CD46, CD55, and CD59 (29, 30). The
overexpression of some of these mCRPs is regarded as a poor
prognostic factor, whereas increased iC3b observed on tumors is
regarded as a favorable prognostic factor (29, 31, 32). These
observations may suggest an in situ role for C-mediated
immunosurveillance of tumors. SKOV-3 cells were observed to
overexpress CD46 and CD55. Up-regulation of CD55 on SKOV-3
cells protected SKOV-3 cells from C-mediated lysis (33). In
addition, up-regulation of CD46 and CD55 would also be expected
to limit the activity of the C3/C5 convertase and therefore result in
decreased opsonization of tumor cells with C3b. Interestingly, the
inhibition of human CD55 in SKOV-3 cells resulted in enhanced
deposition of both human and mouse C3b whereas inhibition of
CD46 only marginally increased C3b deposition on tumor cells. It is
worth noting that in the presence of human C, a limited amount of
C3b was deposited, whereas in the presence of mouse C, a large
amount of C3b was deposited on SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 4B). This may
suggest that human CD55 works less well against the mouse C

system. Nevertheless, blocking human CD55 enhanced mouse C3b
deposition on SKOV-3 cells, confirming previous reports that
human and rodent CD55 are not absolutely species restricted in
their C-inhibiting activities (34, 35). In addition, in vitro cytotoxicity
experiments suggested that inhibition of CD55 would promote
h-glucan–mediated CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity whereas
inhibition of CD46 would provide marginal protection to tumor

cells. The mechanism for this observation may be, in part, due to
the role of CD46 as a cofactor for serum factor I that inactivates
C3b and yields cell-bound iC3b. Because iC3b, and not C3b, is
the high-affinity ligand for the I domain of CR3, it is likely
that inhibition of CD46 activity results in the deposition of more
C3b but in a net decrease in the amount of cell-bound iC3b,
thus ameliorating h-glucan–mediated CR3-dependent cellular

cytotoxicity. In addition, recent studies suggest that CD46 acts
preferentially to inhibit the alternative pathway of C activation
(36, 37). Nevertheless, it was of great interest to explore the role of
in vivo inhibition of mCRPs in the setting of antitumor mAb and
h-glucan immunotherapy, particularly in the SKOV-3 tumor model
that had shown failure previously.
Therefore, blockade of CD55 with neutralizing anti-CD55 mAb
was used in SKOV-3 tumor therapy, in addition to h-glucan and
anti–Her-2/neu antibody therapy, in xenograft models. Although
mCRPs need to work across the species boundary in xenograft
models (29, 38), our data clearly showed regulatory function of
human CD55 for mouse complement system in vitro. Furthermore,
we showed that the addition of anti-CD55 mAb to the combined
h-glucan and anti–Her-2/neu antibody therapy in SKOV-3 cells
yielded significant enhanced tumor regression and long-term
survival with respect to the h-glucan– and anti–Her-2/neu
antibody–treated animals. The enhanced therapeutic efficacy is
associated with increased influx of h-glucan–primed neutrophils
into SKOV-3 tumors. In addition, locally produced C5a was
observed in tumors. The enhanced C activation in SKOV-3 tumors
leads to locally produced C5a thereby recruiting h-glucan–primed
neutrophils to the tumor microenvironment. Thus, blockade of
mCRPs, especially CD55, may synergize with antitumor mAbs to
increase h-glucan–mediated CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity,
thereby enhancing tumor immunotherapy. Indeed, both anti-CD55
mAb and CD55 small interfering RNA enhance complementdependent cytotoxicity mediated by antitumor mAb in vitro
(39–41). Interestingly, the chemotherapeutic drug fludarabine
down-regulates CD55 expression on tumor cells (42). This may well
explain the synergistic cytotoxicity of fludarabine and anti-CD20
mAb (rituximab) in a follicular lymphoma cell line (42). However, one

concern on the use of CD55 mAb blockade in vivo is expression
of CD55 on normal tissues or cells such as RBC (19). This
could potentially lead to hemolytic or vascular disease as a result
of increased C activation on normal cells or targeting by antibodymediated cellular cytotoxicity. This drawback may be overcome by
using bispecific mAb against tumor antigen with higher affinity and
CD55 with lower affinity. A previous study has shown that this
strategy could specifically target tumor cells with minimal binding to
normal cells and increase h-glucan–mediated CR3-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (43). Indeed, bispecific mAb to epithelial cell
adhesion molecule and Crry in rat has shown a significant
therapeutic efficacy for a rat colorectal cancer lung metastasis model
in vivo (44). Moreover, a recent study showed that CD55 is highly
expressed on tumor cells but not on nonneoplastic epithelia,
suggesting that it is feasible to predominately target tumor CD55 (45).
In summary, these observations underscore the importance of
the tumor milieu in the setting of antitumor immunotherapy.
Indeed, it seems that a more complete understanding of the tumor
microenvironment and its potential for local immunosuppression,
such as up-regulation of mCRPs, is required for the ultimate
success of tumor immunotherapy strategies, including h-glucan–
mediated immunotherapy.
