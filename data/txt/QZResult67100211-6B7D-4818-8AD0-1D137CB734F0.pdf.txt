Abstract

Author Manuscript

BCR-ABL transforms bone marrow progenitor cells and promotes genome instability, leading to
development of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib
effectively treats CML, but acquired resistance can develop due to BCR-ABL mutations.
Mechanisms for acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations are not fully understood. Using a novel
culture model of CML acquired resistance, we show that inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase by small
molecule inhibitors or gene knockdown blocks acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and relapse of
CML cells on tyrosine kinase inhibitors. SIRT1 knockdown also suppresses de novo genetic
mutations of HPRT (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase) gene in CML and non-CML cells
upon treatment with DNA damaging agent camptothecin. Although SIRT1 can enhance cellular
DNA damage response, it alters functions of DNA repair machineries in CML cells and stimulates
activity of error-prone DNA damage repair, in association with acquisition of genetic mutations.
These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of SIRT1 for promoting mutation acquisition
in cancer, and have implication for targeting SIRT1 to overcome CML drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a lethal hematopoietic malignancy caused by
oncogenic fusion gene BCR-ABL that activates multiple signaling pathways for cell
proliferation and alters DNA damage repair pathways.1 Development of BCR-ABL tyrosine
kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) was a major milestone in CML treatment that
dramatically increased the 5-year survival of chronic CML patients.2 However, acquired
resistance through genetic mutations of BCR-ABL remains a challenge for CML treatment.
In the accelerated and blast crisis phases of CML, imatinib treatment has poor response and

suffers high frequency of relapse in the patients having response.3 Clinical resistance in
these patients is mediated primarily by genetic mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase
domain.4,5 Among them, T315I mutation is especially problematic because of its frequent
occurrence and failure to respond to treatment with first and second generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitors.6–10 Even in the chronic phase CML, once imatinib is discontinued, the
disease can relapse rapidly with development of BCR-ABL mutations.11 In spite of
significant effort to develop more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to overcome resistance,
mechanisms of acquiring BCR-ABL mutations are not fully clear.

Author Manuscript

To help address resistance mechanisms, we have developed a novel culture model for
acquired resistance using blast crisis CML cell line KCL-22.12 We have shown that
acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations for imatinib resistance does not require pre-existing
mutations or involve aberrant chromosomal rearrangement and mutator phenotype of the
cells. Instead, mutation acquisition is a dynamic process that is influenced by BCR-ABL
gene expression and the native BCR-ABL translocation locus.12 Our study suggests possible
involvement of epigenetic elements on the BCR-ABL translocation locus in deriving the
mutations.

SIRT1 is a mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent histone/protein
deacetylase, and a homologue of yeast silent information regulator 2 that is required for
replicative lifespan extension upon calorie restriction.13 SIRT1 plays direct or indirect roles
in epigenomic regulation by deacetylating histones and chromatin modifiers such as
Suv39h1.14–16 In response to DNA damage, SIRT1 is recruited to DNA double strand break
sites, remodeling local chromatin structure presumably to help repair.17 Multiple DNA
damage repair factors themselves are modified by SIRT1 through deacetylation, including
Ku70,18 Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome protein (NBS1),19 Werner syndrome
protein(WRN),20 and xeroderma pigmentosum c protein 21 for various repair mechanisms.
Loss of SIRT1 results in chromosomal abnormality and translocation in mouse embryonic
cells.18,22 These studies suggest that one important function of SIRT1 is involved in
epigenetic modifications of both local chromatin structure and DNA repair machineries for
facilitating DNA damage repair.

Author Manuscript

While appropriate DNA damage repair restores cellular functions, cells with excessive
damage and unable to repair properly may undergo apoptosis. In this regard, it is important
to note that SIRT1 promotes mammalian cell survival under oxidative and genotoxic
stresses through deacetylation of multiple substrates including p53,23,24 Ku70 25 and FOXO
proteins 26–28. It is plausible that the ability of SIRT1 to promote cell survival and DNA
damage repair may interplay to ensure the survival of cells undergoing DNA damage repair.
However, it is unknown whether SIRT1 may play a role in deriving rare genetic mutations
for cancer drug resistance.
We have shown that tumor suppressor HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1) represses SIRT1
expression to modulate DNA damage response.29 HIC1 is progressively inactivated by
promoter hypermethylation towards blast crisis CML and relapsed leukemia from
chemotherapy.30 We hypothesized that SIRT1 could be activated in CML cells to promote
chemoresistance. We have recently shown that SIRT1 is over-expressed in both primary

CML samples and blast crisis CML cell lines, and that SIRT1 is activated by BCR-ABL in
hematopoietic progenitor cells and this activation is essential for BCR-ABL mediated
leukemogenesis.31 Here we demonstrate that SIRT1 promotes DNA damage repair in CML
cells, but surprisingly, inhibition of SIRT1 suppresses acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations
upon imatinib treatment. SIRT1 knockdown also suppresses de novo genetic mutations of
HPRT gene upon acute DNA damage. The ability of SIRT1 to promote mutation acquisition
is associated with its ability to alter cellular DNA damage repair pathways and increase
error-prone DNA damage repair.

RESULTS
Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 blocked acquired resistance of CML cells to imatinib

Author Manuscript

To examine roles of SIRT1 in CML acquired resistance, we used the KCL-22 cell model
that we have developed.12 KCL-22 cells, originated from a blast crisis CML patient,
undergoes initial apoptosis upon imatinib treatment, but cells re-grow after two weeks with
acquisition of T315I BCR-ABL mutation. For most experiments in this study, the original
KCL-22 cells that have not acquired BCR-ABL mutations or been treated with imatinib
were used as the starting material, referred to as “KCL-22 cells” hereafter. In one subset of
experiments, however, four clonal KCL-22 lines (L1, L7, Ag 3 and Ag 11) that have not
acquired BCR-ABL mutations or been treated with imatinib were used as starting materials.
These clonal KCL-22 lines can acquire different BCR-ABL mutations as described before,12
and they were designated as “clonal KCL-22 cells” or “KCL-22 cell clone(s)” in the text.

Author Manuscript

We first treated KCL-22 cells with SIRT1 inhibitors in the presence or absence of imatinib.
We found that SIRT1 inhibitors, sirtinol, nicotinamide and tenovin-6, all blocked CML cell
relapse when combined with imatinib (Figure 1a–c). Whereas combination of sirtinol with
imatinib increased cell death, tenovin-6 blocked the relapse at as low as 1 μM that was
below the concentrations to increase imatinib-mediated cell killing (Figure 1c and
Supplementary Figure 1). Similarly, nicotinamide blocked cell relapse without enhancing
cell death (Figure 1b).

Author Manuscript

Inhibitors for class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been used for treatment of
hematopoietic malignancies.32 We found that the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) at
2.5 μM and higher concentrations depleted BCR-ABL and killed KCL-22 cells in the
absence of imatinib (Supplementary Figure 2). TSA at low concentrations (1 μM or less)
were insufficient to kill KCL-22 cells, but sensitized KCL-22 cells to imatinib-mediated cell
killing (Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure 2), similar to previous observations of this
class of compounds.33–35 However, TSA at low concentrations failed to prevent relapse of
KCL-22 cells from imatinib and the relapsed cells developed T315I mutation (Figure 1d and
not shown).
Treatment with second generation BCR-ABL inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib also resulted
in relapse and acquisition of T315I mutation in KCL-22 cells, but their combination with
tenovin-6 or sirtinol blocked the recurrence (Figure 1e,f and not shown). We have derived
four KCL-22 cell clones, three of which can acquire different BCR-ABL mutations upon
imatinib treatment, i.e. E255K (clone L1), Y253H (clone L7) and T315I (clone Ag11),

whereas clone Ag3 develops resistance without BCR-ABL mutations.12 We found that
combination of imatinib with sirtinol, but not 1 μM TSA, blocked relapse of all clonal
KCL-22 cells (Figure 1g). Together, these results suggest that SIRT1 inhibitors and HDAC
inhibitors may function distinctly, and combination of SIRT1 inhibition with BCR-ABL
inhibition may be a powerful approach to overcome acquired resistance through BCR-ABL
mutations.
SIRT1 knockdown reduced BCR-ABL mutations and inhibited CML acquired resistance

Author Manuscript

We designed three sets of SIRT1 shRNA to knock down the gene in KCL-22 cells (Figure
2a). The shSIRT1-3 vector exhibited the most robust SIRT1 knockdown that increased cell
apoptosis in the absence or presence of imatinib, whereas shSIRT1-1 and shSIRT1-2 vectors
did not (Figure 2a, b and not shown). By clonogenic assay, all three sets of SIRT1 shRNA
suppressed formation of resistant colonies from KCL-22 cells treated with imatinib and the
efficiency of suppression was proportional to the levels of gene knockdown, with shSIRT1-3
being the most effective (Figure 2c). Mutant colonies derived from scrambled shRNA,
shSIRT1-1 or shSIRT1-2 knockdown were sequenced and confirmed to harbor T315I
mutation (Supplementary Figure 3). In liquid culture, KCL-22 cell relapse on imatinib was
delayed by shSIRT1-2 and completely blocked by shSIRT1-3 (Figure 2d). These findings
are in line with the effect of SIRT1 inhibitors described above and suggest SIRT1 inhibition
suppresses acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and CML cell relapse from imatinib
treatment.

Author Manuscript

To examine if SIRT1 deacetylase activity is required for BCR-ABL mutagenesis, we overexpressed wild type or H363Y deacetylase-deficient SIRT1 24 in KCL-22 cells (Figure 2e).
The expression of either wild type or H363Y SIRT1 did not affect cell growth
(Supplementary Figure 4). Over-expression of wild type SIRT1 elevated mutations but
H363Y SIRT1 expression significantly reduced BCR-ABL mutations (Figure 2f). Together,
our results suggest that high levels of SIRT1 in CML cells promote BCR-ABL mutation
acquisition for acquired resistance, a process that is dependent on SIRT1 deacetylase
function.
SIRT1 promoted de novo genetic mutations of cancer cells upon DNA damage

Author Manuscript

We have shown that acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations under imatinib therapeutic stress is
distinct from formation of spontaneous HPRT mutations that are not required for cell
survival.12 To determine if SIRT1 is involved in regulating mutations under a different
stress condition, we examined effects of SIRT1 knockdown on camptothecin (CPT)-induced
de novo HPRT mutations. CPT is a chemotherapeutic agent that induces DNA damage by
inhibiting topoisomerase I.36 Mock or SIRT1 knockdown KCL-22 cells were cultured with
HAT (hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine) to remove cells bearing pre-existing HPRT
mutations. HAT-selected KCL-22 cells were then treated with CPT to induce DNA damage.
We found that SIRT1 knockdown using shSIRT1-1 or shSIRT1-2 vector drastically
suppressed CPT-induced de novo HPRT mutations in KCL-22 cells (Figure 3a). SIRT1
knockdown also reduced, but to a lesser extent, spontaneous HPRT mutations when these
cells were allowed to grow continuously for one month in culture (Figure 3a). Similarly,
SIRT1 knockdown robustly suppressed CPT-induced de novo HPRT mutations in prostate

cancer PC3 cells (Figure 3b), in which SIRT1 is over-expressed.37,38 Furthermore, we found
that transient exposure of PC3 cells to tenovin-6, sirtinol or nicotinamide for two days was
sufficient to reduce CPT-induced de novo HPRT mutations (Figure 3c). These results
indicate that SIRT1 promotes HPRT mutations under acute CPT-induced stress in a similar
manner to its promotion of BCR-ABL mutations under imatinib therapeutic stress, and that
SIRT1-mediated mutagenesis is independent of cancer cell types.

Author Manuscript

The above findings are surprising given that SIRT1 can promote DNA damage repair,
presumably to suppress genetic mutations.18,22 It has been shown that SIRT1 knockout
impairs DNA damage response in mouse fibroblasts with reduction of γH2AX foci
formation in response to radiation.22 For comparison, we found that SIRT1 knockdown also
reduced γH2AX staining upon CPT treatment in KCL-22 cells (Figure 3d). Accordingly, we
found that SIRT1 inhibitors only slightly increased γH2AX expression in KCL-22 cells in
the presence of imatinib, in contrast to TSA that robustly induced γH2AX expression in the
presence or absence of imatinib (Figure 3e). TSA also more effectively induced γH2AX
expression than SIRT1 inhibitors in prostate cancer cells (Figure 3f). The potent induction of
γH2AX by TSA may be due to its ability to cause actual DNA damage.39 Our results
indicate that suppression of mutation acquisition by SIRT1 inhibition in cancer cells can not
be simply explained by γH2AX change; however, SIRT1 inhibitors do differ from class I/II
HDAC inhibitors for inducing γH2AX expression and suppression of mutation acquisition.
SIRT1 altered DNA damage repair pathways for acquired resistance of CML cells

Author Manuscript

BCR-ABL alters functions of both homologous recombination (HR) and error-prone, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair machineries. BCR-ABL increases expression
of RAD51 that abnormally stimulates HR repair and CML drug resistance.40 BCR-ABL
promotes DNA damage repair but increases genetic mutations in association with the
compromised fidelity of both HR and NHEJ repairs.41 We have shown that acquisition of
BCR-ABL mutations in KCL-22 cells depends on BCR-ABL expression,12 and that BCRABL activates SIRT1 expression.31 To determine if SIRT1 may act as a key downstream
effecter of BCR-ABL to regulate repair machineries for CML acquired resistance, we first
examined the roles of Ku70 that is a key component of NHEJ repair.42 Ku70 is deacetylated
and activated by SIRT1, which promotes both cell survival under stress 25 and DNA damage
repair.18 We found that Ku70 acetylation levels in CML cells was increased in proportion to
the levels of SIRT1 knockdown (Figure 4a), which may inactivate Ku70 functions.25,43
Similarly, over-expression of H363Y deacetylase mutant SIRT1 increased Ku70 acetylation,
whereas over-expression of wild type SIRT1 reduced Ku70 acetylation (Figure 4b).

Author Manuscript

Because the efficient Ku70 knockdown induced apoptosis of KCL-22 cells,31 to segregate
roles of Ku70 in BCR-ABL mutations from apoptosis, we minimally knocked down Ku70
using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 and enriched the transduced cells by
puromycin selection. Low MOI transduction resulted in moderate Ku70 knockdown that did
not increase apoptosis (Figure 4c,d and Supplementary Figure 5), but blocked acquisition of
BCR-ABL mutations in both liquid culture and soft agar assays (Figure 4e,f), suggesting a
crucial role of Ku70 in acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations.

SIRT1 also deacetylates HR repair factor NBS1 (Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome), a
component of MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex,19 and regulates recruitment of
NBS1 and RAD51 to DNA damage foci for repair.18 We found that SIRT1 knockdown
increased NBS1 acetylation in KCL-22 cells (Figure 5a). Knockdown of NBS1 or RAD51
moderately affected cell growth (Figure 5b,c), but suppressed BCR-ABL mutations and
CML cell relapse on imatinib (Figure 5d,e). These results suggest that SIRT1 also regulates
HR repair machineries for BCR-ABL mutation acquisition.

Author Manuscript

To further determine the role of SIRT1 in DNA damage repair in CML cells, we generated
stable KCL-22 cell clones bearing a NHEJ reporter construct EJ5-GFP,44 and clones
carrying a HR reporter DR-GFP.45 After introducing DNA damage on these reporters with
the endonuclease I-SceI by electroporation, we found that NHEJ was more efficient than HR
for DNA damage repair in KCL-22 cells, and that SIRT1 knockdown suppressed both NHEJ
and HR activity with more prominent effect on NHEJ (Figure 6a).

Author Manuscript

Because the procedure of electroporation to introduce I-SceI killed many cells and increased
experimental variation, to improve the assay, we generated an inducible I-SceI expression
lentiviral vector and established stable EJ5-GFP and DR-GFP reporter cell lines with
inducible I-SceI expression. The DNA repair rates for EJ5-GFP and DR-GFP cells after
doxycycline induction were similar to those with I-SceI electroporation, but cell death
remained at the background level (data not shown). Using this system, we found that
knockdown of either SIRT1 or Ku70 reduced NHEJ repair, and simultaneous knockdown of
both genes did not further reduce the repair rate (Figure 6b), further supporting the role of
SIRT1 for activating Ku70 for NHEJ repair. Interestingly, knockdown of NBS1 or RAD51
also reduced NHEJ repair (Figure 6c,d). Although precise mechanisms for such an effect
remain to be elucidated, functional overlap among repair machineries is becoming more
appreciated, for instance, MRN complex is shown to increase NHEJ activity.46–48 Together,
our findings suggest that over-expression of SIRT1 promotes CML acquired resistance
through acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations, which is associated with its ability to modulate
functions of DNA damage repair machineries.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Although SIRT1 is known to enhance DNA damage repair,18,22 our study reveals another
surprising facet of SIRT1 in cancer cells in which it promotes acquisition of genetic
mutations. In CML cells, BCR-ABL promotes genome instability through altering functions
of multiple repair machineries and increasing erroneous DNA damage repair.49 We have
shown that acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations for imatinib resistance is dependent on BCRABL expression,12 and that BCR-ABL transcriptionally activates SIRT1 expression in
hematopoietic progenitor cells.31 Our current study supports that SIRT1 is a key
intermediate of BCR-ABL to alter functions of DNA damage repair machineries and
promote acquisition of genetic mutations for CML drug resistance.
Promoting genetic mutations by SIRT1-regulated DNA damage repair could be a unique
feature of cancer cells. In normal cells, repair fidelity is typically high unless cells are aging
or senescent.50 SIRT1 may function to facilitate DNA damage repair and promote cell

survival. In CML cells, however, BCR-ABL transformation leads to the substantially
increased production of reactive oxygen species and DNA double strand breaks.41 BCRABL alters repair machinery functions to allow rapid repair of DNA damage with reduced
fidelity,41,51 which may critically involve SIRT1, and result in significant increase of repair
errors. The rare genetic mutations generated after erroneous repair in cancer cells may
render survival advantage for resistance when cancer cells are treated with chemotherapeutic
agents. Alternatively, chemotherapeutic stress itself may influence DNA damage repair
process in CML cells, accentuating erroneous repair and promoting de novo acquisition of
mutations for resistance. It remains to be determined how SIRT1 over-expression in cancer
cells may alter DNA damage repair fidelity and how that may cause acquisition of genetic
mutations for cancer drug resistance. We have proposed that the local epigenome of BCRABL translocation locus may play a role in sensing therapeutic stress signals for mutation
acquisition.52 Given that SIRT1 is a stress-response gene and epigenome regulator, it would
be of interest to determine if and how SIRT1 may modulate this process through epigenome
in future.

Author Manuscript

NHEJ is the major repair pathway in higher eukaryotes and also the main contributor for
repair errors.42 Ku70/86 heterodimer is essential for the increased activity of NHEJ and
concomitant DNA misrepair in myeloid leukemia cells.53,54 Consistently, we found that
NHEJ is more effective than HR repair in KCL-22 cells and Ku70 is essential for BCR-ABL
mutation acquisition, which is regulated by SIRT1. Our results also support likely a
crosstalk between NHEJ and other repair machineries. NBS1 is part of the MRN complex
that facilitates the end processing of double strand breaks for HR and NHEJ.46–48 Our
results that knockdown of NBS1 inhibits BCR-ABL mutations and NHEJ repair are in line
with those findings. It is interesting that RAD51 knockdown also reduces BCR-ABL
mutation and NHEJ activity. Although the precise mechanism for this reduction of NHEJ is
not clear, there is evidence of a crosstalk between HR and NHEJ. For example, in response
to DNA damage, HR factor c-ABL that phosphorylates RAD51 42 also phosphorylates
NHEJ factor DNA-PKcs, and competes with Ku70/86 for binding DNA-PKcs.55,56 HR and
NHEJ repair pathways can be even coupled in certain types of damage repair.57

Author Manuscript

Our KCL-22 cell resistance model provides a new tool for uncovering mechanisms of CML
acquired resistance. We demonstrated a proof-of-concept of novel SIRT1 functions in
acquisition of genetic mutations. Although discovered in one cell line, we believe the
conclusion would not be restricted to this cell line or BCR-ABL. First, our mutation
analyses are carried out in two independent systems involving ABL signaling for BCR-ABL
and de novo nucleotide synthesis for HPRT. Second, effects of SIRT1 on HPRT mutations
are also observed in prostate cancer PC3 cells upon DNA damage induced by CPT.
Therefore, we speculate that SIRT1 may have a broader role in acquired resistance of
cancer. Acquired resistance through genetic mutations occurs in targeted therapy of several
types of cancer 58 and SIRT1 is over-expressed in many types of human cancer.37 It would
be interesting to determine if SIRT1 may play a role in acquisition of genetic mutations in
other settings in future.
This study improves our understanding of roles of SIRT1 in cancer drug resistance. This
study also suggests potential therapeutic application of inhibiting aberrant DNA repair

activities through SIRT1 inhibition for cancer therapy. Towards this end, it is important to
note that SIRT1 inhibition can also induce cancer cell apoptosis,23,24,37 and that we have
found that SIRT1 inhibition suppresses BCR-ABL transformation of bone marrow
progenitor cells and leukemogenesis.31 Meanwhile, SIRT1 inhibition is well tolerated by
normal human CD34+ progenitor cells and normal mice.31 SIRT1 (class III deacetylase) and
HDACs (class I and II deacetylases) may have overlapping functions, and inhibitors for
SIRT1 and HDACs can both induce apoptosis. However, we show that they bear important
difference. TSA can cause actual DNA damage and induce robust damage response that may
actually stimulate mutations, whereas SIRT1 inhibitors do not or at least to a much lesser
extent, and therefore, SIRT1 inhibitors have an added advantage to block acquisition of
BCR-ABL mutations. It is likely that inhibition of CML cell survival by SIRT1 inhibitors
may work in concert with blocking BCR-ABL mutations for preventing relapse of CML
cells upon treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In conclusion, our study suggests that
SIRT1 deacetylase promotes acquisition of genetic mutations in CML cells, and targeting
SIRT1 may be valuable for improving CML treatment to overcome resistance.

Drug resistance, BCR-ABL mutation, apoptosis and clonogenic assays
These assays were performed as described previously.12 Briefly, for drug resistance assay,
one half million KCL-22 cells were seeded in 1 ml medium per well in 24-well plates, and
treated with different concentrations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monitored over time.
For sequencing ABL kinase domain, we amplified the ABL kinase domain by RT-PCR of

The following antibodies were used for Western blots: rabbit monoclonal anti-human SIRT1
(Epitomics), mouse monoclonal anti-c-ABL (BD Pharmingen), mouse monoclonal antiKu70 (Neomarker), and rabbit monoclonal anti-NBS1 antibody (Epitomics). To analyze
Ku70 acetylation, we pulled down Ku70 from total cell lysate with anti-Ku70 and protein Aagarose beads (Upstate Biotech) followed by acetylation detection with rabbit anti-acetyl
lysine antibody (Cell Signaling). To analyze NBS1 acetylation, NBS1 was pulled down
using with rabbit anti-NBS1 polyclonal antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) and protein A/G
plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech). The blot was probed with anti-acetyl lysine
antibody followed by rabbit monoclonal anti-NBS1 antibody (Epitomics).
DNA damage induction by camptothecin and de novo mutation analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were pre-selected for four days in HAT medium to remove pre-existing HPRT
mutations. The efficiency of HAT selection was confirmed by plating these cells on soft
agar with 2.5 μg/ml 6-thioguanine, which produced zero colony. HAT-selected cells were
then treated with 0.5 μM CPT for 1 hour, and then cultured for at least 10 days to expand
before being used for soft agar clonogenic assay with 6-thioguanine selection. The rest of
HAT-selected cells were cultured in medium without selection. The change of γH2AX was
analyzed with γH2AX Assay Kit (Upstate Biotech).
DNA damage repair assays

Author Manuscript

Five million KCL-22 cells were transfected with 15 μg linearized repair reporter construct
DR-GFP or EJ5-GFP by electroporation, and cells were selected for puromycin resistance.
Individual clones were plucked from soft agar and expanded to screen for clones carrying an
intact copy of the reporter constructs by Southern blotting as described previously.44,45 The
clones with an intact copy of reporters were transduced by shSIRT1, shKu70, shRAD51 or
shNBS1 for 24h followed by electroporation with 50 μg I-SceI encoding plasmid plus 10 μg
Ds-Red. After another 48 h culture, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP and
Ds-Red expression to determine the repair efficiency. GFP+ cells were the successfully
repaired cells, and repair rate was normalized to Ds-Red transfection efficiency.

Author Manuscript

To generate inducible HR and NHEJ reporter KCL22 cell lines, clonal DR-GFP or EJ5-GFP
cells were infected with a lentiviral vector (pITA.Bleo.rtTA) carrying EF1α promoter-driven
rtTA (reverse tetracycline transactivator) with a bleomycin selection cassette. Cells were
selected with 150μg/mL of zeocin (Invitrogen). We generated another lentiviral vector
(pTZG.puro.iSCE-RFP) expressing mRFP (monomeric red fluorescent protein) and I-SceI
fusion protein driven by tetracycline response element (Tet-on). The zeocin-selected cells
were then infected with pTZG.puro.iSCE-RFP vector. Cells were seeded on soft agar and
clonal cells were plucked and expanded for screening for RFP expression by addition of
1μg/mL doxycycline (Fisher) and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Clones with the
highest RFP expression were used for repair assay. Doxycycline treatment induced RFP
expression in most cells and did not significantly affect cell viability. No GFP expression
was detected in the absence of doxycycline. The repair rate was determined as the
percentage of GFP+ cells over viable cells without normalization to RFP expression. The
