Abstract
Cancer cell chemoresistance arises in part through the acquisition of apoptotic resistance. Leukemia cells
resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis have been found to be sensitive to oridonin, a natural agent
with potent anticancer activity. To investigate its mechanisms of action in reversing chemoresistance, we
compared the response of human leukemia cells with oridonin and the antileukemia drugs Ara-C and VP-16.
Compared with HL60 cells, K562 and K562/ADR cells displayed resistance to apoptosis stimulated by Ara-C
and VP-16 but sensitivity to oridonin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that oridonin upregulated BIM-S
by diminishing the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a, leading to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. In contrast,
neither Ara-C nor VP-16 could reduce miR-17 and miR-20a expression or could trigger BIM-S–mediated
apoptosis. Notably, silencing miR-17 or miR-20a expression by treatment with microRNA (miRNA; miR) inhibitors
or oridonin restored sensitivity of K562 cells to VP-16. Synergistic effects of oridonin and VP-16 were documented
in cultured cells as well as mouse tumor xenograft assays. Inhibiting miR-17 or miR-20a also augmented the
proapoptotic activity of oridonin. Taken together, our results identify a miRNA-dependent mechanism underlying
the anticancer effect of oridonin and provide a rationale for its combination with chemotherapy drugs in
addressing chemoresistant leukemia cells. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4409–19. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Apoptosis, the most common form of programmed cell
death (PCD), is critical in maintaining tissue homeostasis in
multicellular organisms. Defects in apoptotic signaling pathways can result in the unlimited proliferation of cells and might
ultimately lead to the development of cancer. As one of the
hallmarks of cancer (1), the ability to evade apoptosis helps
cancer cells escape from the host immune system and, more
severely, makes them resistant to therapy, such as chemotherapy (2). For example, the K562 chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) cell line was found to be resistant to apoptosis induced
by a variety of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, including
cytarabine (Ara-C), etoposide (VP-16), diphtheria toxin, camptothecin, and paclitaxel (3–7). Therefore, restoring the sensi-

tivity of cancer cells to apoptosis by manipulating apoptotic
signaling pathways may have great signiﬁcance in improving
the efﬁcacy of cancer therapy.
Proteins of the BCL-2 family play crucial regulatory roles in
mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (8–10). In this family, all
members contain at least one of four BCL-2 homology (BH)
domains, designated BH1 to BH4 (11). Members of the BH3only subfamily, including BIM, BIK, BID, BAD, PUMA, NOXA,
BMF, and HRK, contain only the BH3 domain and act as
proapoptotic proteins (12). BIM (BCL-2 interacting mediator
of cell death) was ﬁrst identiﬁed in an expression screen for
proteins that bind to BCL-2 (13), and since then, many isoforms
resulting from alternative splicing have been found. Of these,
BIM-EL (variant 1), BIM-L (variant 6), and BIM-S (variant 11)
are the three main isoforms that have been studied intensively.
Recognized as one of the two BH3-only activator proteins,
BIM can activate the apoptotic executor proteins BAX and
BAK, leading to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria
and the subsequent initiation of apoptosis (14, 15). Increasing
evidence indicates that BIM acts as a tumor suppressor, and
loss of BIM function can lead to tumorigenesis and the
acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy (16). Multiple levels
of regulation have been found to modulate the expression and
the activity of BIM in cells. For example, phosphorylation of
BIM-EL and BIM-L by proteins of the MAPK family (including
ERK, JNK, and MAPK14) can either enhance their apoptotic
activities or promote their degradation (17–20). A class of small
noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNA; miR), has also
been shown to regulate the expression of BIM-EL and BIM-L

posttranscriptionally (21–25). Although BIM-S has been
reported to be the most potent isoform in inducing apoptosis
(13, 16), research on the regulation of BIM-S remains in its
infancy.
Oridonin is a natural diterpenoid isolated from genus Isodon
plants in the 1970s that has attracted increasing attention in
recent years for its potential as a cancer treatment (26). In our
previous mechanistic study, we found that oridonin altered the
expression of MYC-regulated miRNAs in K562 cells, including
miR17-92 and the let-7 family of miRNAs, and induced potent
apoptosis in K562 cells (27). However, it remains unclear why
oridonin can trigger apoptosis in K562 cells that are resistant to
chemotherapy drugs.
With these problems in mind, we examined the different
effects of oridonin and two traditional antileukemia drugs,
Ara-C and VP-16, on multiple leukemia cell lines. We found
that the K562 cell line and its multidrug-resistant subline
K562/ADR displayed resistance to Ara-C- and VP-16–
induced apoptosis but were sensitive to oridonin, whereas
HL60 cells were sensitive to all the three drugs. By downregulating miR-17 and miR-20a miRNAs, oridonin upregulated BIM-S and ultimately led to mitochondria-dependent
apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of
miR-17 or miR-20a restored sensitivity of K562 cells to VP16–induced apoptosis and promoted the proapoptotic activity of oridonin.

Reagents
Oridonin was purchased from JiShi Pharmaceutical, while
cytosine b-D-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C) and etoposide (VP16) were purchased from Sigma. The three agents were
dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) at a concentration of 40, 100,
and 100 mmol/L, respectively, and stored at 20 C before
use in cell culture experiments. The ﬁnal concentration of
DMSO was kept below 0.11% in all cell cultures. When used
in mice, oridonin and VP-16 were dissolved in DMSO at a
stock concentration of 100 mg/mL and freshly diluted with
0.09% NaCl.

Cell viability and apoptosis assays
The cells were cultured in 96-well cell culture plates and
treated the next day as indicated. The effect of drugs on
the number of viable cells was evaluated using MTT assays
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Absorbance (A) was determined at 570 nm with a reference
wavelength of 630 nm. The relative percentage of viable cells
was calculated as follows: viable cells ¼ (Atreatment/ADMSO) 
100%. Inhibition rate was calculated as follows: inhibition
rate ¼ [(ADMSO  AVP-16)/ADMSO]  100%, which represents
the enhanced effect of VP-16 when applied together with
miRNA inhibitors or oridonin.
Apoptosis was determined by ﬂow cytometry using the
Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioVision). The loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential was examined by Rh123
staining and ﬂow cytometry. The cells were analyzed with a
FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences) immediately
after staining. The data were analyzed using FlowJo software
(TreeStar).

Cell culture and transfection
K562 and HL60 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr.
Shimei Zhuang (Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China)
and cultured in Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's Medium
(IMDM), while K562/ADR cell line was purchased from Bogu
Biotechnology and cultured in RPMI-1640 media. The three
cell lines were authenticated using short-tandem repeat
(STR) proﬁling within the last 6 months. HL60/ADR, NB4,
and Jurkat cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Yueqin
Chen (Sun Yat-sen University) and passaged for less than
3 months with RPMI-1640 media. All media were supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. For K562/ADR and HL60/ADR cells, 1 or 0.5
mg/mL of adriamycin (ADR; Sigma) was added in daily
culture, respectively, and removed before experiments. Transient transfections of plasmids and RNA oligonucleotides
were performed using the Neon Transfection System (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instruction.

Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy
Cells with or without oridonin treatment were collected,
resuspended in IMDM medium containing 200 nmol/L Mito
Tracker (Life Technologies), and incubated for 15 minutes at
37 C. Then, the cells were ﬁxed in 4% polyformaldehyde for 10
minutes, loaded onto coverslips and dried, and permeabilized
with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes before they were blocked
with 5% BSA for 1 hour. Primary antibody incubations with
rabbit anti-BIM (#2819; Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-BAX
(#5023; Cell Signaling Technology) were performed at 4 C
overnight, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:250; Beyotime) for 2 hours at room
temperature. After incubating cells with DAPI (5 mg/mL) for
10 minutes, coverslips were mounted onto slides in antifade
mounting medium (Beyotime). PBS was used for all washing
steps. The stained cells were visualized using a TCS SP5
confocal microscope (Leica), and the acquired images were
exported using LAS AF (Leica).

Expression plasmids and RNA oligonucleotides
The coding region sequences of BIM-EL (variant 1), BIM-L
(variant 6), and BIM-S (variant 11) were simultaneously ampliﬁed from K562 cDNA by PCR using the Bim-Forward
(TTGGATCCCGCCACCATGGCAAAGCAACCTTCTGATG) and
Bim-Reverse (TTGAATTCTCAATGCATTCTCCACACCAGG)
primers. Then, the corresponding products were cloned into
the pcDNA3 vector using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites,
and the sequences were conﬁrmed by sequencing.
siRNAs against BIM were synthesized by GenePharma.
The si-Bim-1 (GCUGUAACUUGUAGAAAUA) and si-Bim-2
(GCGGAGAAAUCAAGUUUAA) siRNAs target all isoforms of
BIM, the si-Bim-EL/L (UGACAAAUCAACACAAACC) siRNA
targets the common region of the BIM-EL and BIM-L isoforms,
and the si-Bim-S (CUAUGCAAGGAGGGUAUUU) siRNA
targets the BIM-S isoform only.
miRNA mimics of miR-17 and miR-20a and miRNA inhibitors against all members of the miR17-19b cluster, together
with their corresponding negative control RNAs, were purchased from Dharmacon.

Oridonin Reverses Chemoresistance via miR-17/20a-BIM-S Pathway

Subcellular fractionation
K562 cells with or without oridonin treatment were harvested and washed once in ice-cold PBS buffer. Mitochondria
were isolated from the cytoplasm using the Cell Mitochondria
Isolation Kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Protein concentrations were determined using
the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). Mature miRNA expression was detected by the
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems)
using the miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR Kit
(Exiqon). U6 was used as an internal control unless otherwise
speciﬁed. The data were analyzed using StepOne software V2.0
(Applied Biosystems).
Xenograft construction and drug treatment
All procedures for the experiments involving mice were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun
Yat-sen University.
For the detection of BIM-S in vivo, K562 xenograft-bearing
mouse model was constructed using 5-week-old BALB/c nude
mice (Sun Yat-sen University) and treated intraperitoneally
with oridonin (15 mg/kg) or vehicle (2% DMSO) as previously
described (27). All mice were euthanized after a 12-day treatment, and the tumors were collected and subjected to protein
extraction using TRIzol reagent before Western blot analysis.
For the evaluation of drug efﬁcacy, K562 xenograft-bearing
mouse model was constructed with 7-week-old BALB/c nude
mice (Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center, Guangdong, China) as previously described (27). When the tumors
reached a volume of 100 to 150 mm3, the mice were
randomized into four groups (3 mice/group) and administered intraperitoneally with DMSO vehicle (2%), VP-16 (10
mg/kg), oridonin (10 mg/kg), or VP-16 (10 mg/kg) plus
oridonin (10 mg/kg) every 3 days. Tumor volumes (tumor
length  width2  0.5) were measured with calipers every
day and body weights were monitored daily.
Western blot analysis
The cells were lysed in Triton X-100–containing RIPA buffer
[150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH
7.4), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mmol/L NaF, and 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4] supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche) or in buffer containing 2% SDS as described previously
(27). Equal amounts of protein were loaded and separated by
SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF)
membranes (Millipore), and detected by immunoblotting
using the ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Kit (GE
Healthcare). GAPDH was used as a loading control. The
primary antibodies for caspase-3 (#9662), caspase-9 (#9502),
PARP (#9542), BIM (#2819), BMF (#5889), PUMA (#4976), BAX
(#5023), BAK (#6947), BCL-2 (#2870), MCL-1 (#5453), BCL-XL
(#2764), COXIV (#4850), caspase-7 (#9492), p-JNK (#4668), JNK
(#3708), p-ERK (#9101), ERK (#4695), p-BIM-EL (#4585), and
GAPDH (#2118) were all purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology.

Statistical analysis
The correlation between oridonin activity and the miRNA
expression patterns was evaluated as previously described (27,
28). Brieﬂy, IC50s of oridonin (NSC 637458) against the 48 NCI60 cell lines were obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program screen (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov) and the drug
activity was expressed as log10 IC50, whereas the miRNA
expression patterns were assessed using data from the Israel
laboratory (29). The Pearson correlation coefﬁcients (r), Kendall correlation coefﬁcients (t), and Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients (r) between the activity of oridonin and the gene
expression levels were computed using SPSS software (SPSS
Inc.) with the P values provided.
The data throughout the article are presented as the means
of three independent experiments (three replicates each). Error
bars indicate SD. The signiﬁcant differences were assessed
using Student t test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
K562 and K562/ADR cells are sensitive to oridonin but
not to Ara-C or VP-16
We ﬁrst compared the efﬁcacy of Ara-C, VP-16, and oridonin
on K562 and K562/ADR cell lines, as well as in the drugsensitive cell line HL60, by MTT assays. After a 24-hour
treatment, the percentage of viable HL60 cells was signiﬁcantly
reduced by Ara-C and VP-16 in a concentration-dependent
manner (P < 0.01; Fig. 1A). In contrast, K562 and K562/ADR
cells were minimally affected by either Ara-C or VP-16, even at a
concentration as high as 100 mmol/L. When we treated the
three cell lines with oridonin, however, all these cell lines
exhibited high sensitivities. In particular, treatment with 20
or 40 mmol/L oridonin resulted in a reduction in viable cells of
more than 70% or 65% for the two drug-resistant cell lines,
K562 and K562/ADR, respectively (Fig. 1A).
We next examined the effect of the three agents on apoptosis. FITC–Annexin V/PI double-staining showed that all
three agents effectively induced apoptosis in HL60 cells, whereas only oridonin displayed proapoptotic activity in K562 and
K562/ADR cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, oridonin signiﬁcantly
increased the proportion of Rh123-negative cells (Fig. 1C),
which indicates the occurrence of mitochondria-dependent
apoptosis. It should be noticed that the concentration of
oridonin required for inducing obvious apoptosis in K562/ADR
cells is higher than that in K562 cells (Fig. 1B and C). In
contrast, both Ara-C and VP-16 failed to induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in K562 and K562/ADR cells as
expected (Fig. 1C). These results consistently demonstrate
that both K562 and K562/ADR cells exhibit different sensitivities to the three different agents, being resistant to Ara-C and
VP-16 but sensitive to oridonin.
Oridonin, but not Ara-C or VP-16, induces apoptosis
through upregulation of BIM-S
Given the important role of BCL-2 family proteins in the
process of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, we looked for
change in their expression upon treatment of K562 cells with

the three agents. As shown in Fig. 2A, oridonin depleted the
expression of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 and decreased
the expression of PARP in K562 cells, demonstrating its proapoptotic ability. Of the BCL-2 family proteins detected, the
expression levels of the proapoptotic proteins BMF, PUMA,
BAX, and BAK, as well as the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2,
MCL-1, and BCL-XL, were not affected by the three agents.
However, the expression of the proapoptotic protein BIM was
remarkably altered by oridonin, but not by Ara-C or VP-16 (Fig.
2A). Treatment with oridonin resulted in the occurrence of
higher molecular weight bands above the BIM-EL and BIM-L
isoforms and increased the expression level of the BIM-S

isoform by 2.3-fold in K562 cells. The response of BIM in
K562/ADR cells to these agents was very similar to that in
K562 cells, with retarded bands over BIM-EL and BIM-L and an
increase of BIM-S by 1.6-fold in the presence of oridonin but
not Ara-C or VP-16 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the increase of BIMS by oridonin was consistently observed in other leukemia cell
lines, including HL60/ADR, NB4, and Jurkat (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Combining these data, we hypothesized that changes
in BIM expression upon oridonin treatment might be related to
the apoptosis-inducing ability of oridonin.
In an attempt to understand the response of BIM to
oridonin treatment, we performed immunoﬂuorescence

Oridonin Reverses Chemoresistance via miR-17/20a-BIM-S Pathway

Figure 2. Oridonin increases the expression and mitochondrial localization of BIM-S, which in turn contributes to the proapoptotic ability of oridonin. A, K562
and K562/ADR cells were treated with Ara-C (10 mmol/L), VP-16 (10 mmol/L), oridonin (ori; 20 mmol/L for K562 and 40 mmol/L for K562/ADR), or DMSO (CT) for
24 hours and lysed for Western blot analysis. Images showing the expression of the same protein were cropped from the same blot. The expression of BIM-S
was quantiﬁcated and normalized to GAPDH. B, K562 cells were treated with DMSO or oridonin (20 mmol/L) for 24 hours and immunostained before analysis by
confocal microscopy. Localization of BIM (green), mitochondria (red), nuclei (blue), and BAX (green) are shown. Scale bar, 5 mm. C, mitochondria from K562
cells treated without () or with (þ) oridonin were isolated and subjected to Western blot analysis along with the soluble cytosolic fractions. COXIV and
caspase-7 are markers for mitochondria and cytosolic proteins, respectively. D, knockdown of BIM dramatically protects cells from oridonin-induced
apoptosis. K562 cells were transfected with control (NC) or anti-BIM siRNA. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with 20 mmol/L oridonin for 24 hours
and subjected to FITC–Annexin V/PI staining and ﬂow cytometry (bottom). The speciﬁcity of the siRNAs was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis (top) and the
expression of BIM-S was quantiﬁcated and normalized to GAPDH. E, oridonin upregulates BIM-S in vivo. Top, Western blot analysis of BIM-S expression in

staining in K562 cells. Only a fraction of the BIM pool
was found to colocalize with mitochondria in K562 cells
in the absence of oridonin. However, after treatment with
20 mmol/L oridonin for 24 hours, BIM colocalized very
well with the aggregated mitochondria (Fig. 2B). The same

localization pattern was also observed for BAX (Fig. 2B),
suggesting activation of BAX. In addition, the Western
blotting results supported the increase and accumulation of BIM-S at mitochondria after oridonin treatment
(Fig. 2C).

protein, respectively, in the three cell lines. D, K562 and K562/ADR cells were transfected with miRNA inhibitors, whereas HL60 cells were transfected
with miRNA mimics and analyzed by Western blot analysis 48 hours later.

These data conﬁrm that oridonin upregulates and activates
BIM-S, which was shown to possess the strongest proapoptotic
activity of the BIM isoforms. When overexpressed in K562 cells,
all three main isoforms of BIM (BIM-EL, BIM-L, and BIM-S)
promoted apoptosis, with the percentage of apoptotic cells
induced by BIM-S overexpression being the highest (Supplementary Fig. S2), consistent with previous reports (13, 16).
However, when we knocked down expression of BIM-S by
silencing either all BIM isoforms or the BIM-S isoform specifically, K562 cells gained partial resistance to oridonin-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Therefore, expression of BIM-S contributes
to the proapoptotic ability of oridonin in cellulo. In K562
xenograft models in nude mice, intraperitoneal injection of
oridonin also led to increased expression of BIM-S in tumors
and the delay of tumor growth (Fig. 2E).
Downregulation of miR-17 and miR-20a induced by
oridonin derepresses BIM-S
As shown in Fig. 2A, upon oridonin treatment, we noticed
the appearance of slower migrating bands above the BIM-EL
and BIM-L isoforms in K562 and K562/ADR cells, which we
presumed might be the phosphorylated forms of BIM-EL and
BIM-L, respectively. Indeed, the Western blotting results
showed that oridonin treatment increased the level of phosphorylated BIM-EL as well as the levels of phosphorylated
JNK and ERK (Fig. 3A), which are two kinases that can
phosphorylate BIM-EL and BIM-L as mentioned above. It

4414

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

has been reported that proteins tagged with ubiquitin that
have not been degraded are insoluble in buffers containing
only nonionic detergents; however, these proteins can be
solubilized in SDS-containing buffer (30, 31). As shown in Fig.
3A, the higher molecular weight bands of BIM-EL and BIM-L
disappeared, and the levels of BIM-EL decreased in oridonintreated K562 cells lysed with the nonionic detergent Triton X100 but not in cells lysed with the ionic detergent SDS. These
data suggest that activation of the JNK and ERK kinases in the
presence of oridonin may promote the degradation of BIM-EL
and BIM-L.
In contrast, BIM-S expression was consistently increased by
oridonin, regardless of which type of detergent was used for
lysing the cells (Fig. 3A). Given the potent proapoptotic activity
of BIM-S and its role in oridonin-induced apoptosis, we proceeded to investigate the mechanism underlying the upregulation of BIM-S by oridonin. During our previous studies, we
found that oridonin signiﬁcantly downregulated the expression of the miR17-19b cluster (a truncated miR17-92 cluster,
including miR-17, miR18a, miR19a, miR-20a, and miR19b).
Using data from the Developmental Therapeutics Program
screen, we found that the expression of these miRNAs in 48
NCI-60 cell lines correlated well with oridonin activity (Table
1). This ﬁnding suggested that these miRNAs might be the
targets of oridonin and responsible for the activity of oridonin.
In addition, members of the miR17-19b cluster were predicted
to have potential binding sites within the 30 -untranslated

region (UTR) of BIM-S when analyzed with the TargetScan
program (data not shown; ref. 32), and several members of this
cluster have been shown to inhibit the translation of BIM-EL
and BIM-L, which share a common 30 -UTR with BIM-S (33–35).
Combining all of these ﬁndings, we hypothesize that the
proapoptotic efﬁcacy of oridonin is achieved by downregulating the expression of the miR17-19b cluster and subsequently
derepressing BIM-S.
Results from qRT-PCR showed that oridonin did reduce the
expression of miRNAs in the miR17-19b cluster in multiple
leukemia cell lines under study (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig.
S3). Intriguingly, neither Ara-C nor VP-16 could signiﬁcantly
decrease the expression of these miRNAs, which is in agreement with the observation that they could not upregulate BIMS and induce apoptosis. Within the miR17-19b cluster, miR-17
and miR-20a, two miRNAs that possess the same "seed
sequence," are likely to be the bona ﬁde negative regulators
of BIM-S because that only the inhibitors of miR-17 and miR20a could increase BIM-S protein levels (Supplementary Fig.
S4), and that miR-17 miRNA mimics could target the 30 -UTR of
BIM-S directly in the luciferase reporter assays (Supplementary
Fig. S5). More interestingly, we found that the expression levels
of miR-17 and miR-20a were much higher in K562 and K562/
ADR cells than in HL60 cells, which is inversely correlated with
the expression of BIM-S protein in these cell lines (Fig. 3C).
Knockdown of miR-17 or miR-20a with the corresponding
miRNA inhibitor in K562 and K562/ADR cells signiﬁcantly
increased the expression of BIM-S, whereas ectopic expression
of these miRNAs in HL60 cells reduced BIM-S protein levels
(Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that

Kendall correlation

oridonin decreases the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a and
therefore derepresses BIM-S.
Inhibition of miR-17 or miR-20a by either miRNA
inhibitors or oridonin sensitizes leukemia cells to VP-16
As observed in Figs. 3B and 2A, Ara-C and VP-16 could not
reduce the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a in K562 cells,
which express high levels of miR-17 and miR-20a, nor could
they upregulate BIM-S protein, which might account for the
resistance of K562 cells to Ara-C and VP-16. To test this
possibility, we knocked down the expression of miR-17 or
miR-20a in K562 cells using speciﬁc miRNA inhibitors, and
evaluated the response of these cells to Ara-C or VP-16
treatment. Transfection with antagomiR-17 or antagomiR20a did not affect the efﬁcacy of Ara-C in K562 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6). However, treatment with VP-16 in
antagomiR17- or antagomiR20a-transfected K562 cells
resulted in a remarkable reduction of viable cells (Fig. 4A)
and induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4B), compared with cells
transfected with the control inhibitor.
Given the reduced expression of miR-17 and miR-20a in
K562 cells treated with oridonin, we next examined the possibility of sensitizing K562 cells to Ara-C or VP-16 by cotreatment with oridonin. Oridonin was used at a concentration of 10
mmol/L, which effectively downregulates miR-17 and miR-20a
(Fig. 4C) while having only a mild inhibitory effect on K562 cells
(Fig. 1A). Similar to the effects of antagomi-R17 or antagomiR20a miRNA inhibitor, treatment with oridonin dramatically
enhanced the inhibitory effects of VP-16 but not Ara-C in K562
cells (Fig. 4D and E and Supplementary Fig. S7). Noticeably,

oridonin displayed a synergistic effect with VP-16 both in vitro
and in vivo, as shown by the reduced viability (Fig. 4D) and the
increased apoptosis (Fig. 4E) in cultured K562 cells, as well as
the delay of tumor growth in K562 xenograft-bearing mice (Fig.
4F). Therefore, inhibition of miR-17 or miR-20a, either by
transfection with speciﬁc miRNA inhibitors or treatment with
oridonin, reverses the resistance of K562 cells to VP-16. The
synergistic effect between oridonin and VP-16 can also be
observed in other leukemia cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S8),
although not as obvious as in K562 cells.
miRNA inhibitors of miR-17 or miR-20a enhance
oridonin-induced apoptosis
The results mentioned above indicate a crucial role of miR17 and miR-20a in the proapoptotic activity of oridonin. Thus,
we aimed to determine whether decreasing the levels of miR-17
or miR-20a artiﬁcially could enhance the anticancer activity of
oridonin. Speciﬁc miRNA inhibitors were used to inhibit the
expression of miR-17 or miR-20a in K562 cells before a low
concentration of oridonin was added. A large decrease in the

4416

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

percentage of viable cells was observed in cells treated with
both a miRNA inhibitor and oridonin (Fig. 5A). After treatment
with 5 mmol/L oridonin for 48 hours, the relative number
of viable cells transfected with antagomiR-17 or antagomiR20a decreased to 8.3% or 20.7%, respectively, whereas 72.8% of
cells transfected with a negative control remained viable
(Fig. 5A). In addition, inhibition of miR-17 or miR-20a in
K562 cells further increased the percentage of apoptotic cells
induced by 5 mmol/L oridonin (Fig. 5B). These results indicate
that lowering miR-17 or miR-20a in K562 cells enhanced the
efﬁcacy of oridonin, which provides a novel strategy for the
clinical use of oridonin at a low concentration.

Discussion
The broad-spectrum anticancer activities of oridonin as well
as the underlying mechanisms have been studied for many
years, in the hope of providing evidence for the use of oridonin
in clinical cancer therapy (27, 36–39). Thus far, the mechanistic
studies of oridonin focused on proteins involved in many

Oridonin Reverses Chemoresistance via miR-17/20a-BIM-S Pathway

growth- or apoptosis-related signaling pathways (27, 40).
Although our previous work reported that oridonin altered
miRNA proﬁles in K562 cells (27), the current research
demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that this class of small RNAs
participates in the proapoptotic activity of oridonin. By
reducing the expression levels of miR-17 and miR-20a,
oridonin causes derepression of the proapoptotic BIM-S
protein and the subsequent commitment to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. It seems that downregulation of
miR-17 and miR-20a is essential for the induction of apoptosis by chemotherapy drugs because Ara-C and VP-16
cannot reduce the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a and are
thereby incapable of upregulating BIM-S and triggering
apoptosis in K562 cells and K562/ADR cells.
In addition to revealing the proapoptotic mechanisms of
oridonin, our results support the posttranscriptional regulation of BIM-S by miRNAs of the miR17-92 cluster, speciﬁcally,
miR-17 and miR-20a. The miR17-92 cluster, also known as
oncomiR1, was the ﬁrst oncogenic miRNA cluster to be identiﬁed in the human genome (41). By targeting different cell
cycle–related proteins or tumor-suppressor proteins, miR1792 participates in several oncogenic signaling pathways crucial
for the development of cancer (42, 43). BIM is one of the targets
shown to be downregulated by the miR17-92 cluster in the
development of B cells and several types of cancer (33, 34, 44–
47). However, this type of regulation was mainly described
for the BIM-EL and BIM-L isoforms (34). Because the BIM-S
isoform shares the same 30 -UTR as the other two isoforms
(13, 48), we hypothesized that it was also under the regulation
of miR17-92. Indeed, our results showed that miR-17 and miR20a controlled the expression of BIM-S as well as BIM-EL and
BIM-L. Nevertheless, it was worth notice that only the
expression of BIM-S was upregulated in the presence of
oridonin, whereas the BIM-EL and BIM-L isoforms were
most likely phosphorylated by ERK or JNK and degraded.
Because BIM-S does not contain the phosphorylation sites
found in BIM-EL or BIM-L, it is not surprising that BIM-S has
different miRNA-mediated regulation than that of BIM-EL
and BIM-L upon oridonin treatment. Considering the potent
proapoptotic ability of the BIM-S isoform as shown by us
and other groups, it may be sufﬁcient for oridonin to achieve

www.aacrjournals.org

its proapoptotic activity through an upregulation of BIM-S.
Downregulation or loss of BIM has been linked to resistance
to apoptosis induced by external stimuli (49, 50); thus, our
ﬁnding that oridonin is able to induce BIM-S expression
makes this natural compound a promising agent for BIMtargeted therapy.
Despite previous reports that the BCR-ABL oncoprotein
contributes to resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
in K562 cells (7, 51), the underlying mechanisms remain largely
unclear. With our results, we provide a new understanding of
the chemotherapy resistance of K562 cells as well as K562/ADR
cells that involves miRNAs, namely miR-17 and miR-20a. First,
the expression levels of miR-17 and miR-20a are much higher in
K562 cells and especially in K562/ADR cells than in HL60 cells,
and the latter cell type is more sensitive to chemotherapy. The
different expression patterns of miRNAs results in relatively
low expression of proapoptotic BIM-S in K562 and K562/ADR
cells compared with HL60, therefore confers apoptosis-resistance to these two lines. Second, Ara-C and VP-16 could not
downregulate miR-17 and miR-20a in K562 and K562/ADR cells
and thus were unable to upregulate BIM-S and induce apoptosis. In contrast, oridonin signiﬁcantly reduced the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a, which led to the release of BIM-S
from miRNA-mediated translation inhibition and ultimately
triggered mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Third, inhibition of miR-17 or miR-20a in K562 cells reverses its resistance
to VP-16. Interestingly, the miR17-92 cluster has been reported
to be the downstream target of BCR-ABL and C-MYC in CML
(52). Therefore, our results indicate that the BCR-ABL-MYCmiR-17/20a-BIM-S pathway is the leading cause of chemotherapy resistance of K562 and K562/ADR cells. However, it
seems that regulation of the miR-17/20a-BIM-S pathway by
oridonin is more generalized regardless of the presence of
BCR-ABL, as supported by the data that BCR-ABL–negative
cell lines, such as HL60/ADR and Jurkat, show high sensitivity
to oridonin that involves regulation of the miR-17/20a-BIM-S
pathway as in K562 and K562/ADR cells (Supplementary Figs.
S1, S3, and S8).
Emerging evidence suggests the possibility of dealing with
chemoresistance by modulating the expression of miRNAs in
cancer cells. Meng and colleagues showed that inhibition of

miR21 and miR200b expression increased the sensitivity of
malignant cholangiocytes to gemcitabine (53). In lung cancer
cell lines, the expression of miR-17 was upregulated by STAT-3
and thus contributed to the resistance to the MEK inhibitor
AZD6244. Inhibiting miR-17 expression sensitized the resistant
cells to AZD6244 by inducing the expression of BIM (54). Here,
we report that inhibition of miR-17 or miR-20a expression
results in the upregulation of BIM-S and therefore sensitizes
leukemia cells to VP-16, suggestive of a novel approach to
overcome resistance to VP-16 by combining VP-16 with miR-17
or miR-20a inhibitors. In addition, miR-17 or miR-20a inhibition by miRNA inhibitors augments the anticancer activity of
oridonin, which has great signiﬁcance for lowering the dose of
this natural agent in clinical use to achieve better efﬁcacy and
less toxicity. As for Ara-C, inhibition of miR-17 or miR-20a has
little effect in reversing the resistance of K562 cells, indicating
that effectors other than BIM-S may be required for the
anticancer activity of Ara-C.
Because of their ability to modulate miRNA expression
(27, 55, 56), natural agents may also be used as a novel strategy
in the design of combination therapies to augment traditional
approaches (55). The rationale behind designing a combination therapy is to use agents with different and possibly
complementary mechanisms of action to achieve a better
result in terms of both safety and efﬁcacy (57). Until now,
direct evidence for the combination of miRNA-targeting natural agents with traditional chemotherapy was lacking. In this
study, we showed that a combination of the natural agent
oridonin with the traditional chemotherapeutic drug VP-16
could downregulate miR-17 and miR-20a and could sensitize
K562 and K562/ADR cells to VP-16, thus demonstrating a
synergistic effect. Furthermore, this synergistic effect can also

be observed in K562 xenograft mouse model, in which use of
VP-16 alone has little antitumor efﬁcacy. From a clinical view,
the use of oridonin is much more applicable than miRNA
inhibitors. In addition, oridonin can simultaneously regulate
the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a, therefore is more potent
than the use of a single miRNA inhibitor alone. Our results
provide preclinical evidence for the combined use of oridonin
and VP-16 as a better cancer treatment, especially for those
cancers with miR-17 and miR-20a overexpression and thus are
resistant to standard chemotherapies.
