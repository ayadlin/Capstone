Abstract
Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer
is a prerequisite toward treatment. To enable mechanistic
investigations into the epigenetic regulation of the tumor
suppressor gene cell adhesion molecule 1 (Cadm1) in lung
cancer progenitor cells, we developed 10 cell lines from single,
spontaneously transformed lung tumor cells isolated from
c-Myc and c-Raf double-transgenic mice. Specifically, we
investigated Cadm1 promoter hypermethylation, which was
significantly induced in transgenic transformed cells. Analysis
of 69 CpGs displayed differential methylation pattern between
and within progenitor cell lines, and the degree of methylation
correlated well with transcriptional repression. Indeed,
restoration of Cadm1 gene expression was achieved by
treatment with the experimental demethylating drug 5-aza2¶-deoxycytidine. Furthermore, methylation of core CpGs in
the binding sites of Sp1, Sp3, and zinc finger 5 along the
promoter region of Cadm1 abrogated DNA-protein binding.
Treatment with mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1 or Sp3
binding, resulted in reduction of Cadm1 gene expression,
therefore suggesting a potential role of Sp1/Sp3 in Cadm1
regulation. Identifying molecular rules for the epigenetic
control of tumor suppressor genes enables mechanistic
insights into lung cancer growth and opportunities for novel
therapies. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7587–96]

Introduction
Lung cancer is a leading cause of death, but molecular
mechanisms underlying the disease are largely unknown. Thus,
mouse models for human lung cancer have been developed in
recent years to understand disease mechanisms (see reviews,
refs. 1, 2). These models include mouse strains with spontaneous
or carcinogen-induced tumors, as well as transgenic and knockout
mice, in which lung tumors arise due to engineered genetic
modifications. There is evidence for the proto-oncogenes c-Myc
and c-Raf to play a role in human lung malignancies (3, 4), and
transgenic mouse lines for these proto-oncogenes have been
established to study tumorigenesis of adenocarcinomas derived
from alveolar epithelium (5–7). Transgenic c-Myc mice developed
within 10 to 14 months bronchioloalveolar carcinomas and
papillary adenocarcinomas, whereas transgenic c-Raf mice

exhibited atypical adenomatous hyperplasia as early as 3 months,
postnatally. In the past, proteome mapping of c-Raf tumors has
been reported (8).
Here, we developed 10 cell lines from single, spontaneously
transformed lung tumor cells isolated from mice double-transgenic
for the proto-oncogenes c-Myc and c-Raf. These lines would enable
mechanistic investigations into the regulation of the gene encoding
cell adhesion molecule 1 (Cadm1; Mouse Genome Informatics) in
lung cancer progenitor cells. Cadm1 is the mouse orthologue of
the human gene CADM1 (TSLC1, IGSF4; for other synonyms, see
Human Gene Nomenclature;1 ref. 9). CADM1 displays tumor
suppressor activity in human cancer, particularly non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC; ref. 10). Indeed, loss or reduction of CADM1
protein expression was observed in human lung adenocarcinomas
and correlated with poor prognosis of patients, thus indicating
clinical significance (11–13). Nonetheless, this relationship may not
be true for all types of lung tumors. After analysis of 47 primary
lung adenocarcinoma of patients, only f40% had decreased
CADM1 protein expression (12). Specifically, CADM1 was similar to
healthy tissue in 16 bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (BAC) and 12
adenocarcinomas other than BAC, but a further study on CADM1
protein in 93 lung adenocarcinomas evidenced loss of expression
in 65% of the cases (13). This loss of expression correlated
significantly with the non-BAC component and proliferative
activity of the tumors. Lung adenocarcinomas with high CADM1
expression showed better prognosis than those without expression.
When CADM1 protein was reexpressed in an NSCLC line A549,
induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor growth were
observed, suggesting the potential of CADM1 for gene therapy (14).
In general, the CADM1 gene encodes a 442-aa immunoglobin
superfamily cell adhesion molecule and participates in cell-cell
interactions (15). The CADM1 protein is a transmembrane
glycoprotein consisting of an extracellular domain containing
three immunoglobin-like C2-type domains, the transmembrane
domain, and the cytoplasmic domain (10, 15). In vivo tumorigenesis
in nude mice showed that deletion of the cytoplasmic domain
abrogates the tumor suppressor activity of Cadm1 (16), and
epigenetic silencing through promoter hypermethylation of
CADM1 was observed in lung cancer (10, 17, 18).
Notably, epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is a
frequent phenomenon in cancer ( for instance, see reviews;
refs. 19, 20), but the epigenetic mechanisms are still unknown. To
gain more insights into the epigenetic control of Cadm1 resulting
in transcriptional repression, we have undertaken a comprehensive
analysis of methylated CpGs along the promoter region of Cadm1.
We also determined whether methylation of specific CpGs within

putative binding sites of transcription factors in the promoter

confirmed results by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
supershift functional assays. Identifying molecular rules for the
epigenetic control of tumor suppressor genes in lung cancer
progenitor cells of transgenic c-Myc and c-Raf mouse lung tumors
enables mechanistic insights into lung cancer growth and
opportunities for novel therapies.

Materials and Methods
Lung tumors and lung cancer cell lines. We analyzed 6 lung tumors
and 10 cancer cell lines from c-Myc and c-Raf transgenic mice. The
development of the c-Myc and c-Raf double-transgenic mice and the
histopathology of lung tumors resulting from the overexpression of these
proto-oncogenes form part of a related study on global gene expression
analysis.2 Cells were isolated from lung tumors of 8-month-old transgenic
mice using our protocol for the isolation and primary culture of rodent
respiratory epithelial cells (21). With this protocol, by day 4, mRNA for the
pulmonary surfactant-associated protein C (Sp-C), which is specifically
activated in alveolar epithelium, can be detected in nontransgenic cells.
Normal lungs from three nontransgenic mice were used as control.
Gene expression analysis. Total RNA was isolated from frozen mouse
lung tissues or cell lines with RNeasy Mini kit, and reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR) was undertaken with Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen).
Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed on T3 thermocyclers (Biometra),
whereas quantitative RT-PCR on Light Cycler (Roche) using Thermostart
Taq polymerase (ABgene).
Typically, 25 to 50 ng of cDNA were used for template. Reaction
components and cycling variables are according to standard procedure. For

both semiquantitative and quantitative RT-PCR, the primers used for
Cadm1 consisted of forward primer 5¶-caactatccctcctcccaca-3¶ and reverse
primer 5¶-tagctgtgtctgcgtctgct-3¶.
5-Aza-2¶-deoxycytidine treatment of cells. Cells (3  106) were seeded
in T25 cell culture flasks containing 5 mL of DMEM with 10% FCS,
2 L-glutamine, and 2 penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were cultured 48 h,
treated with fresh 2 Amol/L 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; Sigma)
dissolved in medium for 3 d, and allowed to recover for 2 d.
Prediction of promoter region and DNA methylation analysis. To
predict for the promoter region of mouse Cadm1 and to identify CpG island
in this region, we used the 2,000 nt ( 2,000 bp) of the translation start site
ATG. We used publicly available prediction programs, such as Promoter
2.0,3 Promoter Scan,4 and CpG island searcher.5 Genomic DNA was isolated
in tissue samples and cell lines using Nucleo Spin Tissue (Macherey-Nagel).
Bisulfite treatment was undertaken on 1 Ag genomic DNA using CpGenome
DNA Modification kit (Chemicon International) or EpiTect Bisulfite kit
(Qiagen) using manufacturer’s instructions, but treatment at 65jC instead
of 60jC. Primers for methylation assays (Supplementary Table S1) were
designed with MethPrimer.6 PCR fragments were directly sequenced using
BigDyeTerminator v3.1 kit and ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems), or PCR fragments were cloned using TOPOTA Cloning kit
(Invitrogen) before sequencing. Sequences were analyzed using SeqMan
(Lasergene 7.0). Differential methylation was determined in at least five
clones.
Isolation of protein extracts, Western blot analysis, and EMSA.
Procedures for the isolation of protein extracts, Western blot analysis, and
EMSA have been described previously (22). Protein extracts were isolated
from mouse lung tissues or cell lines. For binding experiments, 2 to 10 Ag
of nuclear proteins were used. Sp1 antibody (Sc-59) and Sp3 antibody

complementary oligonucleotides using standard procedures. For Western
blot analysis, total (100 Ag) or nuclear (30 Ag) protein extracts isolated from
mouse lung tissues or cell lines were used. Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies were
described above, whereas Cadm1 antibody was purchased from Abnova
(Igsf4, H00023705-M01, clone 2A5).
Mithramycin A treatment. Cells (1  106) were seeded in T75 cell
culture flasks containing 5 mL of DMEM with 10% FCS, 2 L-glutamine,
and 2 penicillin/streptomycin for 5 d (f90% confluence), treated with
500 ng/mL mithramycin A for 24 h. Cells were pelleted for isolation of
nuclear extracts and RNA.

Results
Characterization of lung cancer cell lines from c-Myc and
c-Raf double-transgenic mice. To enable mechanistic studies,

we isolated spontaneously transformed tumor cells from mice
double-transgenic for c-Myc and c-Raf (see Fig. 1A and B). After 4
to 7 days of culture, cells from the transgenic mice exhibited the
typical cuboidal phenotype (Fig. 1B). By day 10, some cells began to
attain different morphologic characteristics (Fig. 1B), indicating
individual phenotypes of tumor cells. From single cuboidal cells,
10 cell lines could be established. Double-transgenicity for c-Raf
and c-Myc in the cell lines were confirmed by PCR detection of the
transgenes (Fig. 1C). The 10 cell lines no longer expressed the
mRNA for surfactant proteins (data not shown), which tend to
disappear in culture by day 7 (23). Nonetheless, transcripts of
Vim and Eno2, which are markers of epithelial tumors, were
strongly expressed (Fig. 1D).
Because genetic alterations are known to occur in cancer cells,
we determined by sequencing the presence of any hotspots
mutations in Kras and Trp53 two genes implicated in lung cancer,
particularly in smokers (24). We did not detect sequence alterations

span in values obtained.

in 6 lung tumors and 10 cell lines from the c-Myc and c-Raf doubletransgenic mice. Furthermore, sequencing of the entire Cadm1
gene amplified from these lung tumors and cell lines did not reveal
any mutations.
Cadm1 is repressed in lung tumors and cancer cell lines
from c-Myc and c-Raf double-transgenic mice. We then
examined the gene expression of Cadm1 in three normal lungs
from nontransgenic mice, as well as 6 lung tumors and 10 cancer
cell lines from c-Myc and c-Raf double-transgenic mice. Cadm1
expression was markedly reduced in tumors and cell lines
compared with the three normal lungs from nontransgenic mice
(Fig. 2A). In 7 of 10 cell lines, Cadm1 expression was basically
absent. This loss of Cadm1 gene expression correlated with
corresponding protein expression, which was also reduced in lung
tumors and absent in all cancer cell lines except one (Fig. 2B). For
the cell line B3, which displayed the highest Cadm1 expression
among the cell lines, a faint protein expression was observed (data
not shown). The Cadm1 repression pointed to a possible epigenetic
regulation, especially because two cell lines responded to treatment
with the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC, thereby restoring Cadm1
expression (Fig. 2C).
For comparison with Cadm1, we also investigated the gene
expression of Dal1 (differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of
the lung ), a gene encoding an actin-binding protein and with
which Cadm1 directly associates (25). Dal1 expression was
reduced in the tumors than in controls, but much elevated in the
cell lines (Fig. 2D). This relationship remained essentially true
even when the cell lines were cultured at 50% confluency.
Nevertheless, Dal1 expression seemed to be less at 50%, especially
with hD10, which showed the lowest among the cell lines (data not
shown). Indeed, whereas Cadm1 expression decreased to nonexistent in the cell lines, Dal1 expression remarkably increased
(Fig. 2A versus Fig. 2D). Interestingly though, in the two cell lines
where Cadm1 was restored after 5-aza-dC treatment, Dal1
increased correspondingly (Fig. 2C).
Aberrant hypermethylation in the promoter region of
Cadm1 correlates with loss of gene expression. The absence
of Cadm1 mutations in the lung tumors and cell lines and
restoration of the Cadm1 expression through 5-aza-dC treatment
prompted us to investigate the epigenetic silencing of this gene
through CpG methylation of the promoter region. In the past,
CpG methylation of the Cadm1 promoter has been investigated in
rat and human genomes, but not in mouse. Initially, we annotated
the promoter region of mouse Cadm1 and used the 2,000 nt
( 2,000 bp) upstream of the translation start site ATG of Cadm1 to
identify CpG islands in this region. We used several programs
to predict the CpG island (see Materials and Methods); essentially,
the same results were obtained. For instance, a CpG island was
predicted starting 808 ATG (i.e., length, 809 bp; %GC, 60;
ObsCpG/ExpCpG, 0.846). In human CADM1, the predicted TATA
Box is located 374 to 371 from ATG (see ref. 17) and six CpGs
( 458, 440, 433, 397, 394, 381) are routinely analyzed
for hypermethylation in this gene. Using this information from
human CADM1, we performed alignment using human and mouse
sequences to determine homologous regions (Fig. 3A). There is very
high similarity between human and mouse sequences, especially
within the 200 nt before translation start site.
Most techniques used in identifying methylated CpGs are based
on bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA, which converts cytosine
to uracil, but methylated cytosines remain unaltered in this
process. During PCR amplification, uracil will be converted to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

thymidine, which can then be detected by sequencing. PCR is
performed using a pair of primers not containing CpGs, thereby
amplifying both methylated and unmethylated fragments (bisulfite
sequencing) or a pair of primers that specifically amplify only
methylated fragments (MSP-PCR). To search for methylated CpGs
associated with loss of Cadm1 expression, especially those which
may abrogate binding of transcription factors, we developed five
assays covering a total of 69 CpGs, including five CpGs in the
coding region (Fig. 3B).
Assay 1 (6 CpGs, 944 to 837) and assay 2 (10 CpGs, 682 to
531) are based on bisulfite sequencing, whereas assay 3 (14 CpGs,
456 to 341), assay 4 (27 CpGs, 396 to 180), and assay 5 (37
CpGs, 302 to +41) are based on MSP-PCR and sequencing. Due to
high frequency of CpGs, no PCR primers for bisulfite sequencing
could be obtained to investigate methylation status nearer the
translation start site. The three MSP-PCR assays overlap each
other. After bisulfite treatment and direct sequencing of the PCR
product, a CpG site was scored methylated if the C (methylated)
allele was f20% of the T (not methylated) allele. But for assay 4,
PCR products were cloned before sequencing due to high CG
content, causing difficulties in obtaining clear direct sequencing
electropherograms. Examples and results of the five different
assays are shown in Fig. 4A–C and summarized in Supplementary
Table S3.
Overall, we observed methylation in 69 CpGs, including five
CpGs after the translation start site (see Fig. 4A and C).
Methylation pattern in seven cell lines lacking or with minimal
Cadm1 gene expression was denser than those lines with gene
expression (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, after cloning and sequencing of
clones, differential methylation pattern was observed between and
within cell lines (Fig. 4B and C). The degree of methylation as
determined by methylation index (MI), which is the number of
methylated CpGs over total CpGs, correlated highly with the loss of
gene expression (Fig. 5). Regardless of assay, this correlation was
clearly observed in cell lines than in tumors, which may be caused
by a mixture of normal and tumor cells.
Methylated CpGs within the core binding sequence of
transcription factors lead to abrogation of binding. Methylation of CpGs in the promoter region of genes can lead to
abrogation of binding of transcription factors. Using Transfac,7 we
analyzed for putative binding sites of transcription factors in the
promoter region of Cadm1, in particular those containing CpGs
within the predicted core sequence. Such analysis revealed three
Sp1, an Sp3, and a zinc finger 5 (Zf5) binding sites (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S1). The Sp1 binding sites would affect CpGs
224 (Sp1-3), 211 (Sp1-2), and 164 (Sp1-1), whereas Sp3 that of
CpG 437. The Zf5 binding site would involve CpGs 192, 190,
and 188. Methylation of these CpGs sites was observed especially
in cell lines with markedly reduced Cadm1 expression. For Sp1 site,
CpG 164 (Sp1-1) was more heavily methylated than CpGs 224
(Sp1-3) and 211 (Sp1-2; Supplementary Fig. S1).
We designed oligonucleotide probes and carried out EMSA on
Sp1 using nuclear extracts from the cell line A2C12, in which
Cadm1 was not expressed. The EMSA probes consisted of the
following: wild type, a probe containing two mutated nucleotides
in the core sequence, a probe with methylated CpG in the core
sequence, and a probe with two methylated CpGs outside the

core sequence (see Supplementary Table S2). Compared with
the wild-type probe, binding was dramatically reduced in the
mutated probe, as well as in the probe with methylated CpG
in the core sequence (Fig. 6A). Binding was not abolished in the
probe where methylation occurred outside the core sequence.
Similar results were obtained from nuclear extracts isolated
from normal lung tissues, as well as from the cell line A2C12
that was treated with 5-aza-dC which were used as controls
(data not shown). The Sp1 antibody could supershift the bound
protein and detect a protein of an expected size of 106 kDa in
the nuclear extracts of the cell line A2C12 after Western blot
analysis (Fig. 6A).
Similar experiments were conducted on Sp3, using three
oligonucleotide probes consisting of a wild type, a probe containing
two mutated nucleotides in the core sequence, and a probe in
which the CpG in the core sequence was methylated (see Supple-

mentary Table S2; Fig. 6B). Binding was observed in the wildtype probe, and bound protein was supershifted with the Sp3
antibody. In the mutated probe, no binding was observed, whereas
in the methylated probe, binding was observed, but the bound
protein was not supershifted by the Sp3 antibody. After Western
blot analysis, the Sp3 antibody detected a protein of an expected
size of 100 kDa in the nuclear extracts of the cell line A2C12
(Fig. 6B).
It is of considerable importance that mithramycin A, which is an
inhibitor of Sp1 or Sp3 binding, could block the expression of genes
regulated by these transcription factors (26). On the other hand,
mithramycin A may also function as a demethylating agent on lung
cancer cells (27). To determine such effects on the regulation of
Cadm1, we treated a cell line (B3) that still expressed Cadm1, as
well as a cell line (A2C12) with no Cadm1 expression, both with
500 ng/mL mithramycin A for 24 h (Fig. 6C). We observed a

decrease of Cadm1 gene expression in the cell line B3. In contrast,
there was no restoration of gene expression in A2C12.
To determine methylation of the putative binding site of Zf5 in
the promoter region of Cadm1, we used three oligonucleotide
probes for EMSA as follows: wild type, a probe with all three CpGs
in the core sequence that were methylated, and a probe in which
the nucleotide C in the three CpGs of the core sequence were
mutated to T (see Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 6D). With the wildtype probe, binding was observed with 10 Ag of nuclear extracts
whether from normal lung tissues or from the cell line A2C12,
treated or untreated with 5-aza-dC. This binding was not observed
in the methylated probe. In the mutated probe, binding was also
observed, but this was different from the wild-type and the
methylated probe. Because no Zf5 antibody is available commercially, supershift experiments and Western blot analysis could not
be undertaken.

Discussion
Recent developments in the field of ‘‘epigenetics,’’ i.e., heritable
changes in gene expression without accompanying alterations in
the DNA sequence, show a much wider contribution of epigenetic
alterations in the development of cancer (see reviews; refs. 19,
20, 28). Epigenetic changes, which include DNA methylation,
histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs, can disrupt the
normal stem-cell or progenitor-cell program leading to disease
(19, 29). This epigenetic progenitor model of cancer puts forward
that cancer first arises as an epigenetic alteration of stem/
progenitor cells within a given tissue, which is mediated by
aberrant regulation of tumor progenitor genes. Furthermore, tumor
cell heterogeneity is due in part to epigenetic variation in
progenitor cells, and epigenetic plasticity together with genetic
lesions drives tumor progression. Thus, in line with this view,
epigenetically disrupted stem/progenitor cells might be a crucial
target for cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention.
We thus investigated the epigenetic control of Cadm1 in 10
different cancer progenitor cells of transgenic c-Myc and c-Raf

www.aacrjournals.org

mouse lung tumors. These cell lines were established from single,
spontaneously transformed cells. We also analyzed six lung tumors
from c-Myc and c-Raf double-transgenic mice, as well as three
normal lungs from nontransgenic mice as controls. As compared
with the normal lungs, Cadm1 gene expression was markedly
reduced or absent in lung tumors and cell lines, and this result
corresponded with loss of protein expression. Treatment with
the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC restored Cadm1 expression
in two cell lines, suggesting epigenetic regulation. Using five
different assays, we investigated the methylation status of
69 CpGs, including five CpGs after the translation start site.
Overall, methylation pattern in seven cell lines lacking or with
minimal Cadm1 gene expression was denser than those lines
with gene expression (see Fig. 4). Furthermore, after cloning
and sequencing of clones, differential methylation pattern was
observed between and within cell lines. The degree of methylation
correlated highly with the loss of gene expression, and this correlation was clearly observed in the cell lines regardless of assay
used. Thus, we show transcriptional repression and promoter
hypermethylation of Cadm1 in lung cancer. Investigations into the
different cancer progenitor cells of transgenic c-Myc and c-Raf
mouse lung tumors bring mechanistic insights into the epigenetic
control of Cadm1.
Promoter hypermethylation of CADM1 (TSLC1, IGSF4) that
is associated with loss of gene expression is known in various
cancer in humans, including NSCLC (10, 17, 18). Analysis of
methylation of CADM1 promoter region in primary NSCLCs
showed methylation in 21 of 48 tumors (17). Furthermore,
investigation of 103 primary NSCLCs for association of CADM1
methylation with tobacco smoking and with the clinical characteristics of tumors found methylation in 45% cases (18). Methylation
was observed in all histologic subtypes of NSCLC, including
adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous
carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. In rats, the expression of
the Cadm1 gene and its methylation pattern in lung adenocarcinomas induced by N-nitrosobis (2-hydroxypropyl) amine (BHP)

Sp3 antibody (arrow ). No binding in the mutated probe (Mut ); in the methylated probe (Meth ), there was binding, but the bound protein was not supershifted by
the Sp3 antibody. Right, Western blot analysis, the Sp3 antibody detected a protein of an expected size of 100 kDa in nuclear extracts isolated from cell line A2C12 that
was treated or not treated with 5-aza-dC (Aza ) and used in the EMSA experiment. C, Cadm1 expression after treatment with mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1 or
Sp3 binding. Presence of RNA was controlled by RT-PCR of the housekeeping gene Actb (not shown). Cell line B3 that still expressed Cadm1 , as well as cell line
A2C12 with no Cadm1 expression, were treated with 500 ng/mL mithramycin A for 24 h. Quantitative RT-PCR results show a decrease of Cadm1 expression in
the cell line B3 after mithramycin A (MMA) treatment. Negative control, no DNA. D, EMSA with Zf5 probes, wild type (Wt), a probe with all three CpGs in the core
sequence methylated (Meth ), and a probe in which the nucleotide C in the three CpGs of the core sequence mutated to T (Mut ). For each probe, 2, 5, and
10 Ag of nuclear extracts were used. In the wild-type probe, binding was observed with 10 Ag of nuclear extracts (arrow ). No binding in the methylated probe (Meth );
in the mutated probe, binding was also observed, but this was different from the wild-type and methylated probe.

has been studied as well (30). Cadm1 was highly methylated
in four lung adenocarcinomas, but unmethylated in two normal
lung tissues, suggesting aberrant Cadm1 methylation may be
involved in BHP-induced development of lung adenocarcinomas
in rats.

Results from methylation studies may be influenced by the
number and location of analyzed CpGs sites, as well as the assay
used. To obtain a comprehensive map of methylation in the
promoter region of Cadm1, we used five assays, in which four could
be directly sequenced giving an average level of methylation

Epigenetic Silencing of Cadm1 in Lung Cancer

of a CpG site in the mixture of amplified fragments. Bisulfite
sequencing, when feasible, is the most reliable method. Amplification with methylation-specific primers, which relies heavily on
primer design, may lead to false negatives or positives and could
be biased unless followed by sequencing (see Supplementary
Table S3). This can be exemplified in assay 5 to interrogate 37 CpGs
( 302 to +41). This assay was carried out using a pair of
methylation-specific primers, in which three CpGs ( 302, 298,
296) are contained in the forward primer and two CpGs in
the reverse primer (+38, +41). We were able to amplify fragments in
all samples, whether they are normal lungs, tumors, or cell lines.
But after sequencing, in contrast to the cell lines, no other
methylated CpGs were observed in the normal lungs and tumors,
except those CpGs contained in the primers (see Supplementary
Fig. S1). The degree of methylation obtained with this assay
for CpGs 302 to +41 seems to correlate highly with the loss
of Cadm1 expression (see Fig. 4C). Similar finding was obtained
in the homologous region in human CADM1. After methylation
mapping of CADM1 in human cervical cancer, a 180-bp unmethylated core immediately upstream of the ATG site was
found to correlate most strongly with the active expression of this
gene (31).
CADM1 directly associates with DAL1, a gene encoding an actinbinding protein likewise implicated in the suppression of growth in
lung cancer cells. DAL1 anchors CADM1 to the actin cytoskeleton;
thus, loss of DAL1 expression could lead to decreased cell adhesion
(25). Inactivation of DAL1 due to promoter hypermethylation has
been observed in human lung cancer as well (32–34). We, therefore,
also determined Dal1 expression in our study samples. We found
that Dal1 expression was reduced in c-Myc and c-Raf mouse lung
tumors than in normal lungs, but surprisingly, much more elevated
in the cell lines. Indeed, whereas Cadm1 expression decreased to
nonexistent in the cell lines, Dal1 expression remarkably increased.
A previous study generated mice deficient for Dal1 gene to
elucidate its function in development and tumorigenesis (35).
Dal1 null mice developed normally and were fertile. Rates of
cellular proliferation and apoptosis in brain, mammary, and lung
tissues from the 4.1B/Dal-1 null mice were indistinguishable
from those seen with wild-type mice. Aging studies indicate that
these mice did not have a propensity to develop tumors. These
findings indicate that the Dal1 gene is not required for normal
development and that Dal1 may not function as a tumor suppressor gene.
DNA methylation in the promoter of certain genes is
associated with transcriptional silencing. Such methylation can
affect gene expression by interfering with transcription factor
binding or by recruiting histone deacetylases through methylDNA–binding proteins. Indeed, many of these transcription
factors bind to sequences containing CpGs, and binding can be
hindered by methylation. Our analysis of potential binding sites
of transcription factors in the promoter region of Cadm1
revealed those of Sp1, Sp3, and Zf5 in which CpGs are present
in the core site. The transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 are
ubiquitously expressed and bind to GC-rich promoter region.
Several studies show methylation-dependent disruption of Sp1
or Sp3 binding leading to reduced expression of targeted gene
(36–38). This disruption may even involve methylated CpGs outside the consensus binding site, such as in p21(Cip1) promoter
(36). In p21(Cip1) promoter, by using an electrophoretic mobility
shift assay, methylation within the consensus Sp1-binding site
did not reduce Sp1/Sp3 binding, but methylation outside of

www.aacrjournals.org

the consensus Sp1 element induced a significant decrease in Sp1/
Sp3 binding.
We determined whether methylation of potential Sp1 or Sp3
binding sites in the promoter region of Cadm1 could affect binding.
Our results on Sp1 showed that binding was dramatically reduced
in the mutated EMSA probe, as well as in the probe with
methylated CpG in the core sequence compared with the wild-type
probe. However, binding was not abolished in the probe wherein
methylation occurred outside the core sequence. With Sp3,
mutation in the core consensus site led to no binding, but in the
methylated probe, binding was observed, but the bound protein
was no longer supershifted by the Sp3 antibody. These findings
suggest that Sp1 or Sp3 may be involved in the transcriptional
regulation of Cadm1 in mouse and that promoter hypermethylation can lead to abrogation of binding. Furthermore, we analyzed
the effects of mithramycin A, a drug that modifies GC-rich regions
of the DNA and blocks Sp1 or Sp3 binding on the expression of
Cadm1. Our treatment of a cell line (B3) that still expressed Cadm1
with 500 ng/mL mithramycin A for 24 h led to a decrease of gene
expression, thus further documenting the importance of Sp1 and
Sp3 in causing transcriptional activation. Further studies are
required to determine quantitatively the role of Sp1 and Sp3 in the
transcriptional regulation of Cadm1.
Additionally, Zf5 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that
contains five COOH terminal zinc fingers and a conserved NH2
terminal ZiN/POZ domain. Originally cloned as a transcriptional
repressor from the mouse c-Myc promoter, Zf5 can act as an
activator, as well as a repressor of transcription (39, 40). The POZ
domain contributes to the repressor activity, whereas the active
function results from the DNA-binding ability of the zinc finger
domain. We also investigated whether methylation of the putative
binding site of Zf5 in the promoter region of Cadm1 could affect
binding. Compared with the wild-type probe, binding was not
observed in the methylated probe. This suggests a possible role of
Zf5 in the regulation of Cadm1, but further studies on its activation
are necessary, although a previous report suggested a direct
relationship between intact Sp1 sites and Zf5 in promoter
activation (39). Indeed, activation of the HIV-1 long terminal
repeat by Zf5 depends on Zf5 binding to DNA, three intact Sp1
sites, and the Zf5 ZiN/POZ domain.
In conclusion, we investigated the consequences of c-Myc and
c-Raf overexpression on the epigenetic regulation of the tumor
suppressor gene Cadm1. Indeed, tumor progenitor cells isolated
from lung tumors can be used in determining the molecular basis
for response and resistance to drug therapies or to even predict
which patients are likely to respond to treatment. Unlike studies
with DNA isolated from entire tumors, where results are rather
difficult to interpret due to contamination of normal cells, the use
of spontaneously transformed cancer cell lineages enable mechanistic investigations of Cadm1 gene expression. Notably, the cell
lines exhibited heterogeneity of DNA methylation pattern resulting
in differential repression of Cadm1 expression and response to
5-aza-dC, a demethylating drug in clinical development for the
treatment of leukemia.
A further point of consideration is the plasticity seen in the
lung tumor cell lines. Upon treatment with 5-aza-dC and despite
repeated treatments at different dose levels (e.g., 10 Amol/L) and
prolonged treatment regiments, Cadm1 expression was restored
in two cell lines only, whereas the remaining eight lines from the
same tumors did not respond to this treatment. This shows
epigenetic plasticity in response to treatment with 5-aza-dC.

Knowledge of the precise epigenetic control of tumor suppressor
genes is crucial for their controlled reactivation in lung cancer
cells by epigenetic drugs, which represents a new class of
