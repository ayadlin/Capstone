BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–mediated angiogenesis plays an important role in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ramucirumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF receptor 2. This phase 2 study
investigated ramucirumab in combination with first-line pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in advanced/metastatic NSCLC.
METHODS: Eligible stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC patients with no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized 1:1 to
pemetrexed and carboplatin (or cisplatin) or ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) plus pemetrexed and carboplatin (or cisplatin) once every 3
weeks. Treatment was given for 4 to 6 cycles, and this was followed by a maintenance phase with pemetrexed or ramucirumab and
pemetrexed. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) with a sample size of sufficient power to detect an increase
from 7 to 10.4 months. RESULTS: From October 2010 to October 2011, 140 patients were randomized (pemetrexed-platinum arm, 71;
ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm, 69), and most baseline characteristics were similar for the 2 treatment arms. The median
PFS was 5.6 months for the pemetrexed-platinum arm and 7.2 months for the ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm (hazard ratio,
0.75; P 5.132). The objective response rates were 38.0% and 49.3% for the pemetrexed-platinum and ramucirumab-pemetrexedplatinum arms, respectively (P 5.180). The disease control rate was 70.4% for the pemetrexed-platinum arm and 85.5% for the
ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm (P 5.032). The grade 3 or higher adverse events occurring in 10% or more of patients were
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, nausea, back pain, and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint of significant prolongation of PFS was not met; however, ramucirumab showed evidence of clinical activity in combination with pemetrexed
and platinum in nonsquamous NSCLC patients. The addition of ramucirumab to pemetrexed and platinum did not result in new or

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide: 85% of patients diagnosed with lung cancer will die from the
disease.1 The majority of lung cancers (84%) are classified as non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and there are 3 main
subtypes: adenocarcinomas (40%), squamous cell carcinomas (25%-30%), and large cell carcinomas (10%-15%).2,3 Current standard chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, or pemetrexed combined with a platinum compound, results in overall survival (OS) of 8 to 12 months.4-8

For NSCLC patients with nonsquamous histology,
a combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin results in OS
of 9 to 11 months.9 In patients with nonsquamous histology who have no evidence of progressive disease after 4
cycles of doublet chemotherapy, treatment with pemetrexed in a maintenance setting results in OS of 13.9
months.10
Angiogenesis is a tightly controlled, multistep process that is a component of both normal and pathologic
physiology (including tumor growth and metastasis).11-14
A number of growth factors, including members of the
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, have
been identified as positive regulators of angiogenesis.14
VEGF and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
(VEGFR2) are overexpressed in the majority of cancers.14
A correlation between VEGFR2 expression and tumor
microvessel density has been associated with a poor prognosis, advanced disease, an increased risk of metastasis
and recurrence, and lower relapse-free survival in patients
with a variety of cancers, including NSCLC.15,16 Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the
VEGF ligand, is currently the only antiangiogenic agent
approved for nonsquamous NSCLC.17
Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B; LY3009806) is a fully
human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that
specifically binds to the extracellular domain of VEGFR2
with high affinity. Ramucirumab blocks the interaction of
VEGFR2 and VEGF ligands and inhibits VEGFstimulated endothelial proliferation and migration.18,19
This study was conducted to determine whether the addition of ramucirumab to a standard first-line platinumbased combination chemotherapy regimen would result
884

in prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients
with advanced/metastatic NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Treatment

This was a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter, international, phase 2 study of ramucirumab combined with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in
patients with recurrent or advanced nonsquamous and
squamous NSCLC (Fig. 1). Enrollment was stratified by
histology and completed in the nonsquamous arms independently of the squamous arms. The protocol for this
single study specified that analyses would be conducted
separately according to histology.
Nonsquamous NSCLC patients were randomized
before induction therapy in a 1:1 ratio to receive pemetrexed plus carboplatin (or cisplatin) or ramucirumab plus
pemetrexed and carboplatin (or cisplatin) through a callin interactive voice response system or interactive Web
response system. Patients received the induction combination treatment for a minimum of four 21-day cycles (up
to 6 cycles). Patients without evidence of disease progression then entered a maintenance phase and received
pemetrexed or pemetrexed plus ramucirumab. Ramucirumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/
kg over 60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Pemetrexed
was administered at a dose of 500 mg/m2 intravenously
over 10 to 15 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. In addition,
folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone were coadministered with pemetrexed. Platinum therapy was the investigator’s choice. Carboplatin was administered at a dose

with an area under the curve of 6 over 30 minutes on day
1 of each cycle approximately 30 minutes after the end of
the pemetrexed infusion. Cisplatin was administered at a
dose of 75 mg/m2 over 120 minutes on day 1 of each
cycle. Predefined dose omissions, delays, reductions, and
discontinuations were allowed to manage clinically significant treatment-related toxicity.
Squamous NSCLC patients were randomized before
induction therapy in a 1:1 ratio via the interactive voice
response system/interactive Web response system to
receive gemcitabine plus carboplatin (or cisplatin) or
ramucirumab plus gemcitabine and carboplatin (or cisplatin). Patients treated with ramucirumab plus gemcitabine
and carboplatin (or cisplatin) without evidence of disease
progression then entered a maintenance phase. Patients
treated with gemcitabine plus carboplatin (or cisplatin)
did not enter the maintenance phase. Gemcitabine was
administered intravenously at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 over
30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle. Carboplatin (area under the curve, 5) was administered intravenously over 30 minutes on day 1 of every 21-day cycle.
Ramucirumab and cisplatin were administered as previously stated.
This article reports the results for nonsquamous
NSCLC patients enrolled in this trial because pemetrexed
is indicated for use only in nonsquamous patients. The
study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical
Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The
protocol was approved by each participating center’s ethics
review board, and patients signed written informed consent forms before they underwent any study procedure.
Eligibility

Male or female patients who were at least 18 years of age,
had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV
nonsquamous NSCLC (American Joint Committee on
Cancer, version 7), had measurable disease at the time of
study entry as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1), had an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 to 2, and had adequate organ function were
eligible to participate in the study.
The study exclusion criteria included previous chemotherapy for stage IV NSCLC; recent (within 28 days) or
planned surgery; untreated central nervous system metastases (patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if
they were clinically stable); an increased risk of pulmonary
bleeding as determined by radiologically documented evidence of major blood vessel invasion or encasement by cancer; and a serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone

fracture within 28 days before randomization. Also
excluded were patients at increased risk of bleeding complications as indicated by uncontrolled thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorders; patients with poorly controlled
hypertension; patients who experienced clinically relevant
coronary artery disease, had a myocardial infarction within
6 months before randomization, or had uncontrolled congestive heart failure; and patients who received chronic
daily treatment with aspirin (>325 mg/day) or other
known inhibitors of platelet function. Patients who had a
history of gross hemoptysis within 2 months of trial entry
and experienced any grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal bleeding
within 3 months before study entry were also excluded.
Assessments

The primary objective was to assess PFS in patients treated
with ramucirumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Secondary objectives included the radiographic
objective response rate (ORR; evaluated every 2 cycles [6
weeks 6 3 days] according to RECIST [version 1.1] and
locally reviewed), disease control rate, OS, and safety and
toxicity profile. Patients were followed for survival up to 2
years from randomization. The safety and tolerability of
ramucirumab were assessed on the basis of reported adverse
events (AEs; graded with the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.02), physical examinations, and laboratory tests.
Treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest
(AESIs) were also assessed and were defined as events that
may or may not be associated with ramucirumab therapy,
including infusion-related reactions, hypertension, arterial
or venous thrombotic events, bleeding (hemorrhagic)
events, and proteinuria. Exploratory subgroup analyses for
PFS were performed with a Cox proportional hazards
model for the following: age; sex; ECOG performance status; platinum agent used; initial disease stage at diagnosis;
histology; liver, pleural, and bone metastases; smoking status; prior radiation; maintenance therapy; induction therapy; and central nervous system metastases.
Statistical Analyses

A sample size of 140 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC
allowed a minimum of 103 PFS events at the time of the
primary analysis. This provided 60% power to detect the
expected increase in PFS from a baseline of 7 months
(chemotherapy) based on the results of a phase 3 trial evaluating pemetrexed maintenance therapy20 to 10.4 months
(ramucirumab plus chemotherapy) with a 1-sided logrank test at the 0.05 significance level.
PFS was analyzed for the intention-to-treat population with the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared

with the log-rank test at a 2-sided level of significance of
a 5 0.10. The study was not powered for OS, which was
analyzed with the same method used for PFS.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Disposition

Patient disposition is shown in Figure 2. This article
reports the results for nonsquamous NSCLC patients enrolled in this trial. Results for the squamous portion of the
study are not yet available because the study is still
ongoing. From October 2010 to October 2011, 140
patients were randomized; 136 patients received treatment (pemetrexed plus platinum, n 5 69; ramucirumab
plus pemetrexed and platinum, n 5 67). Baseline characteristics (age, race, and ECOG performance status) were
balanced between the arms; there was a modest imbalance
in the number of females in the ramucirumab arm (Table
1). The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma.
Treatment Duration and Dose Intensity

In the pemetrexed-platinum arm, 66.7% and 44.9% of
the patients completed 4 and 6 cycles, respectively. Exposure to pemetrexed in the ramucirumab-pemetrexedplatinum arm was higher than that in the pemetrexedplatinum arm. The median number of completed chemotherapy cycles for pemetrexed was 5.0 (range, 1-29) for
886

the pemetrexed-platinum arm and 8.0 (range, 1-26) for
the ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm. The median
relative dose intensities for pemetrexed were 97.4%
(pemetrexed plus platinum) and 92.0% (ramucirumab
plus pemetrexed and platinum). Approximately 42% of
the patients in the pemetrexed-platinum arm entered the
maintenance phase.
In the ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm,
74.6% and 61.2% of the patients completed 4 and 6
cycles, respectively. The median number of completed
cycles for ramucirumab was 8.0 (range, 1-26) for the
ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm. The median
relative dose intensity for ramucirumab was 95.8%.
Approximately 60% of the patients in the ramucirumabpemetrexed-platinum arm entered the maintenance
phase.
The majority of the patients received carboplatin
(pemetrexed plus carboplatin, n 5 48; ramucirumab plus
pemetrexed and carboplatin, n 5 47) instead of cisplatin
(pemetrexed plus cisplatin, n 5 21; ramucirumab plus
pemetrexed and cisplatin, n 5 20). The choice of therapy
was similar across the treatment arms. The median number of completed cycles for carboplatin was 4.0 (range, 16) for the pemetrexed-carboplatin arm and 5.0 (range, 16) for the ramucirumab-pemetrexed-carboplatin arm. The
median relative dose intensity for carboplatin was 120.0%

cycles for cisplatin was 4.0 (range, 1-6) for both treatment
arms. The median relative dose intensities for cisplatin
were 98.8% for the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm and 99.2%

platinum arm. As depicted in Figure 4, the HR favored
ramucirumab plus pemetrexed and platinum across most
subgroups; however, the CI often crossed 1.
OS was assessed when the last randomized patient
reached the 2-year survival mark; 53 deaths (76.8%)
occurred in the ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm,
and 49 (69.0%) occurred in the pemetrexed-platinum
arm. Nine ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum patients
and 16 pemetrexed-platinum patients were still alive at
the analysis. The HR was 1.03 (90% CI, 0.74-1.42;
P 5 .892). The median OS was 13.9 months (90% CI,
10.0-17.8 months) with ramucirumab plus pemetrexed
and platinum and 10.4 months (90% CI, 8.2-15.9
months) with pemetrexed plus platinum (Table 2 and
Fig. 5).
Response rates are summarized in Table 2. The
ORRs were 49.3% (90% CI, 39.4%-59.2%) and 38.0%
(90% CI, 28.6%-47.5%) for the ramucirumabpemetrexed-platinum arm and the pemetrexed-platinum
arm, respectively (P 5 .180). The difference in disease
control rates—85.5% (90% CI, 78.5%-92.5%) in the
ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm and 70.4%
(90% CI, 61.5%-79.3%) in the pemetrexed-platinum
arm—was statistically significant (P 5 .032).
Safety Profile

The percentages of patients who experienced at least 1
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of any grade
were similar for the 2 arms (Table 3). Grade 3 or higher
TEAEs occurred in 80.6% of the ramucirumabpemetrexed-platinum patients and in 76.8% of the
pemetrexed-platinum patients. The most commonly
reported TEAEs (20%, any grade) observed at a higher

In the ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm, 3
patients (4.5%) had a grade 5 AE: myocardial infarction,
multiorgan failure, and sudden death. The myocardial infarction and the sudden death were considered possibly
related to ramucirumab. In the pemetrexed-platinum
arm, 5 patients (7.2%) had a grade 5 AE: cardiorespiratory arrest, embolism, hemothorax, myocardial infarction, and respiratory failure.
Treatment-emergent AESIs of any grade occurred in
45 ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum patients (67.2%)
and 28 pemetrexed-platinum patients (40.6%), with 18
ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum patients (26.9%)
and 9 pemetrexed-platinum patients (13.0%) experiencing grade 3 or higher events (Table 4). Individual AESIs
were primarily grade 1 and 2. Individual any-grade AESI
terms occurring at an incidence  5% in either treatment
arm (ramucirumab plus pemetrexed and platinum vs

increase (grade 1-2, 9.0% vs 10.1%; no grade  3), and
gingival bleeding (grade 1-2, 6.0% vs 0%; no grade  3).
For patients who received ramucirumab, no grade 4 or

hemorrhaging (only grade 1-2 hemoptysis occurred
[4.5%]) were reported.
Twenty-two patients (32.8%) in the ramucirumabpemetrexed-platinum arm and 14 patients (20.3%) in the

DISCUSSION
The treatment of advanced NSCLC with combination
chemotherapy that includes a platinum-based agent has
been shown to extend median OS.6 Recent studies have
focused on the addition of targeted biologic agents to
platinum-containing chemotherapy to improve clinical
outcomes. The current study was conducted to determine
whether the addition of ramucirumab, a VEGFR2 inhibitor, to an already effective combination chemotherapy
regimen would result in survival and other benefits
beyond those associated with combination chemotherapy
alone. The primary endpoint of significant prolongation
of PFS was not met; however, there was evidence of clinical activity of ramucirumab plus pemetrexed and platinum in patients with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC not
previously treated with chemotherapy.
The ORR was not significantly improved for
patients receiving ramucirumab versus those receiving
only pemetrexed and platinum–based therapy. However, the disease control rate was significantly higher
for patients receiving ramucirumab versus those receiving only pemetrexed and platinum–based therapy.
Although statistically significant improvements in PFS
and ORR were not achieved, the statistically significant
improvement in the disease control rate suggests some
possible clinical benefit of adding ramucirumab to
established pemetrexed-platinum chemotherapy for the
first-line treatment of nonsquamous NSCLC. However,
because of the previously proven benefit of adding
antiangiogenics to first-line chemotherapy doublets,17
the possibility exists that the benefit of combination
and continuation with pemetrexed in this population is
sufficiently great that the impact of ramucirumab is
less apparent. It is also possible that there is a specific
synergy with some platinum doublets versus others.
The results of this phase 2 study warrant further exploration of the suggested clinical activity of adding ramucirumab to such chemotherapy doublets.
The safety profile of ramucirumab in combination
with pemetrexed-platinum chemotherapy is consistent
with previous clinical investigations of each of these
agents, with no new or unexpected safety findings

Ramucirumab as a single-agent treatment for
advanced gastric cancer (REGARD)21 and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer
Cancer

March 15, 2015

Ramucirumab in Nonsquamous NSCLC/Doebele et al

(RAINBOW)22 has shown significant efficacy. In addition, ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel has
shown a statistically significant improvement in OS in the
second-line treatment of advanced squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC (REVEL).23
Despite demonstrated improvements in efficacy
across tumor types and advances in genomics, no predictive biomarkers have been identified for the inhibition of
angiogenesis.24,25 Germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been investigated as potential biomarker candidates for antiangiogenic treatments, and there may be
potential to substantially improve the therapeutic outcomes of this class of drugs through patient selection;
however, the clinical relevance of these potential candidates remains unknown, and research in this area remains
mostly exploratory.26 Currently, ramucirumab exploratory biomarker assay development is ongoing; retrospective analyses of past and ongoing studies will provide a
robust data set for the identification of potential biomarker targets.
FUNDING SUPPORT
