ABSTRACT
Autophagy is one of the main cytoprotective mechanisms that cancer cells
deploy to withstand the cytotoxic stress and survive the lethal damage induced by
anti-cancer drugs. However, under specific conditions, autophagy may, directly or
indirectly, induce cell death. In our study, treatment of the Atg5-deficient DU145
prostate cancer cells, with the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, induces
mitochondrial damage, autophagy and cell death. Molecular inhibition of autophagy
by silencing ULK1 and Beclin1 rescues DU145 cells from cell death indicating that,
in this setting, autophagy promotes cell death. Re-expression of Atg5 restores the
lipidation of LC3 and rescues DU145 and MEF atg5-/- cells from sorafenib-induced
cell death. Despite the lack of Atg5 expression and LC3 lipidation, DU145 cells form
autophagosomes as demonstrated by transmission and immuno-electron microscopy,
and the formation of LC3 positive foci. However, the lack of cellular content in the
autophagosomes, the accumulation of long-lived proteins, the presence of GFPRFP-LC3 positive foci and the accumulated p62 protein levels indicate that these
autophagosomes may not be fully functional. DU145 cells treated with sorafenib
undergo a caspase-independent cell death that is inhibited by the RIPK1 inhibitor,
necrostatin-1. Furthermore, treatment with sorafenib induces the interaction of
RIPK1 with p62, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and a proximity ligation
assay. Silencing of p62 decreases the RIPK1 protein levels and renders necrostatin-1
ineffective in blocking sorafenib-induced cell death. In summary, the formation of
Atg5-deficient autophagosomes in response to sorafenib promotes the interaction of
p62 with RIPK leading to cell death by necroptosis.

INTRODUCTION

CRPC do not offer significant survival benefits but rather
have a palliative role. Several novel cancer therapeutics
against CRPC have been lately introduced into the clinic,
including single or multi-tyrosine kinase (TKI) inhibitors.
Receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (TK)
regulate multiple signal transduction pathways that
promote growth, resistance to cell death and metastasis

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common
malignancy in men and the metastatic, castration resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) is the second most frequent
cause of cancer related deaths in the western world [1].
Currently, the second line therapeutic modalities for

of most cancers including prostate cancer [2]. Progression
from PCa to CRPC has been associated with the
constitutive activation of receptor TKs (e.g. plateletderived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR), vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR)) and as non-receptor
TK (e.g. Src) [3]. Hence, several targeted TKI such as
sunitinib, erlotinib, dasatinib and sorafenib have been
developed and tested in the clinic for their efficacy against
prostate cancer [4-6].
Sorafenib, a type II TKI, targets the Raf kinases
including Raf-1 and b-Raf, as well as VEGFR-2 and -3,
PDGFR-β, Flt-3 and c-KIT, most of which are known to
be activated in CRPC [5]. Sorafenib has been introduced
in several prostate cancer clinical trials and the initial
data coming out indicate that in some patients, sorafenib
treatment may have beneficial effects but further followups are required [7]. Apart from inhibiting TK, sorafenib,
at clinically relevant concentrations, has been shown to
severely disrupt mitochondrial respiration and function,
by directly inhibiting complex II, III and V of the electron
transport chain [8].
A frequent effect observed in the clinic and in
experimental cancer models treated with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors is the induction of autophagy [9-13]. Autophagy
is regulated by well characterised and orchestrated
sequence of molecular events that lead to the formation of
the autophagosomes, vesicles that engulf the cytoplasmic
content targeted for degradation by the lysosomes [14]. It
is a cytoprotective, physiological process that maintains
homeostasis by relieving the cell from cytotoxic, damaged
organelles as well as support survival during conditions
of metabolic stress [15, 16]. In the cancer setting,
autophagy has a dual role both of which aim to protect
the cancer cells. In the early stages of tumorigenesis,
autophagy plays a tumor suppressive role by eliminating
intracellular insults that may induce DNA damage, genetic
instability and promote irregular cell growth [17]. Thus,
frequently, autophagy is temporarily inhibited to allow for
cancer cell growth. In the later stages of tumor growth
and in metastasis, autophagy plays a tumor promoting
role providing cancer cells with the necessary nutrients,
intracellular and extracellular defences to survive, adapt
and disseminate [17].
Even though in most cases autophagy plays a
cytoprotective role, there are several experimental
evidences pointing towards to being a mechanism of cell
death in a cell type and stress-specific manner [18-20].
Autosis was recently introduced as a mode of autophagic
cell death that is mediated by the inhibition of the Na+,
K+-ATPase pump and has unique morphological features
[20]. Alternatively, autophagy may employ the necroptosis
machinery to induce cell death in Rhabdomyosarcoma
cell lines, upon treatment with the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 antagonist Obatoclax [21]. This newly discovered
cross-talk between autophagy and necroptosis was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also demonstrated in renal cell carcinoma cells where
the induction of autophagy by rapamycin suppresses
the RIPK-dependent necroptosis by facilitating the
degradation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 [22].
Necroptosis is a caspase-independent form of
regulated cell death [23, 24]. It is induced by a wide
variety of stimuli (e.g. cell death ligands, pathogen
recognition receptors, viral RNA sensors, DNA damage
and hypoxia) which converge at the formation of a
supramolecular complex called the necrosome [25].
Formation of the necrosome leads to the activation of
the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), its
substrate RIPK3 and the downstream executioner of
necroptosis, Mixed Lineage Kinase Like (MLKL) [23].
Several experimental evidence with RIPK1, RIPK3 and
MLKL knockout mice as well as clinical studies have
demonstrated that necroptosis plays an important role in a
variety of several pathological conditions including cancer,
myocardial infarction and stroke, ischemia reperfusion
injury and atherosclerosis [26, 27].
In the present study, we provide evidence that
Atg5-deficient DU145 prostate cancer cells undergo
caspase-independent, autophagic cell death in response to
sorafenib. This mode of cell death can be prevented by
either the re-expression of Atg5 or the molecular inhibition
of key autophagy regulators such as ULK1 or Beclin1.
Furthermore we show that induction of autophagy leads
to the activation of necroptosis in a p62-dependent manner
and chemical or molecular inhibition of RIPK1 renders the
cells resistant to sorafenib.

RESULTS
Sorafenib induces autophagy-dependent cell
death in DU145 cells
We have previously shown that sorafenib (Sor)
induces cell death in 22Rv1 and PC3 prostate cancer (PCa)
cell lines [28]. The cytotoxic efficacy of Sor is increased
when autophagy is inhibited by chemical or molecular
means [28]. In contrast to these two PCa cell lines, Sorinduced-cell death in DU145 cells was potentiated upon
inhibition of the autophagic machinery. Silencing of
ULK1, an important regulator of the autophagy-initiation
step, with two specific siRNAs led to a significant
decrease of Sor-induced cell death in DU145 cells
whereas it did not have any effect in PC3 cells (Figure
1A and 1B). We examined further the role of autophagy
in Sorafenib-induced cell death by utilising two different
shRNA constructs against Beclin1 (Figure 1C and 1D).
Stable transfection with these Beclin1 shRNA constructs
also protected DU145 cells from Sor-induced cell death
whereas it potentiated cell death in PC3 cells (Figure
1E). These data indicate that the autophagic machinery is

(cell death marker) and TMRE (functional mitochondria
marker) demonstrated a rapid decrease in mitochondrial
membrane potential at 4h followed by Annexin V positive
staining (Supplementary figure 1E and 1F).
It is known that autophagy is one of the main
mechanisms of removing damaged organelles such as
mitochondria (i.e. mitophagy) from the cells [30]. In
an attempt to correlate the Sor-induced mitochondrial
dysfunction with autophagy, we performed a time lapse
confocal microscopy experiment. DU145 cells stably
transfected with GFP-LC3 were stained with TMRE. After
4h of treatment, mitochondrial depolarisation was evident
and was followed by the appearance of multiple GFP-LC3
foci by 8h up to 24h after Sor treatment (Figure 2A).
The detection of these GFP-LC3 foci was surprising
since it has been shown that DU145 cells do not undergo
autophagy in response to starvation and Valproic acid
treatment due to the lack of Atg5 expression [31]. This
is due to the expression of alternative Atg5 transcripts

Sorafenib induces the formation of LC3 positive
autophagosomes in the Atg5 deficient, DU145 cells
It was previously shown that Sor induces
mitochondrial damage by directly inhibiting complex II,
III and V of the respiratory chain in the mitochondria,
leading to severe mitochondrial damage and depolarisation
in isolated mitochondria and in liver cancer stem
cells [8, 29]. In agreement with these observations,
we found, by transmission electron microscopy and
confocal microscopy, that treatment of DU145 cells with
20µM Sor resulted in extensive mitochondrial damage
(Supplementary figure 1A and 1B). Treatment with Sor
also led to an inhibition of mitochondrial respiration
already at 4h and a decrease in intracellular ATP levels
(Supplementary figure 1C and 1D). Cell death analysis by

that lack one or two exons, leading to the premature
termination of Atg5 protein translation. We confirmed the
lack of Atg5 expression, in our experimental setting, the
lack of LC3 lipidation as well as an observed accumulation
of p62 protein levels compared to PC3 cells, none of

which changed upon treatment with Sor (Figure 2B).
Treatment of DU145 cells with Sor revealed
intracellular structures characteristic of autophagosomes
as judged by confocal microscopy images and time lapse
microscopy of GFP-LC3 transfected cells (Figure 2C and

time-lapse videos 1 and 2). Similar data were obtained
by confocal fluorescent microscopy for stainings of the
endogenous LC3 and p62 proteins (Supplementary Figure
2). Furthermore, GFP-LC3 positive foci, characteristic of
autophagic vesicles were also detected in DU145 cells
treated with the late autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1
(BafA1), (Figure 2C). Interestingly, these GFP-LC3 foci
were similar to those observed in PC3 cells that express
Atg5. The observed induction of GFP-LC3 positive foci
upon treatment with Sor was also evident in MEF cells
that are deficient in Atg5. Importantly, reconstitution of
Atg5 expression in MEF Atg5-/- cells led to a decrease
of GFP-LC3 autophagic foci to levels similar to wt MEF
cells (Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B and 3C).
We examined the presence of LC3 by immunogoldelectron microscopy in the observed, by transmission
electron microscopy, autophagosomal structures (Figure
2D and 2E). We found that LC3 was lining up the
membrane of the autophagosomes in DU145 cells treated
with either Sor or BafA1.
Since we could not monitor the autophagic flux by

one of the classical methods, i.e. by measuring the levels
of LC3 lipidation, we stably transfected the cells with the
tandem GFP-RFP-LC3 construct. This assay is based on
the different pH stability of EGFP and mRFP fluorescent
proteins with yellow foci indicating the presence of
autophagosomes and the presence of red foci the presence
of autophagolysosomes. We found that in DU145 cells,
GFP-RFP-LC3 (yellow) foci formed upon treatment with
Sor or BafA1 but very few red foci, indicative, perhaps of
their inefficient degradation by lysosomes (Supplementary
Figure 4A and 4B). These data were in contrast to PC3
cells in which many foci were RFP positive indicative of
the formation of autophagolysosomes and the subsequent
quenching of EGFP due to low pH.
We also utilised the long-lived protein degradation
assay to assess the functionality and efficacy of the
autophagic process. We have utilised a recently published,
fluorescent variant of the classical, radioactive longlived protein degradation method [32]. We measured
the levels of the long-lived proteins in DU145 cells
by flow cytometry and visualised them by confocal

microscopy (Supplementary Figure 5A and 5B). We
found that treatment with Sor increased the amount of
fluorescently labelled long-lived proteins compared
to control, suggesting that treatment with Sor inhibits
their degradation by autophagolysosomes. Treatment
with BafA1 led to a bigger increase in the levels of the
long-lived proteins (Supplementary Figure 5A and 5B).
To further address the effect of Sor on the autophagic
machinery we used DU145 cells stably transfected with an
shRNA against Beclin1 or transiently with siRNA against
ULK1. In both settings, knockdown of these proteins led
to the accumulation of long-lived proteins in the control
cells and treatment with Sor did not further increase the
levels of long-lived proteins (Supplementary Figure 5C
and 5D). These data indicate that although Sor induces
the formation of autophagosomal structures in an Atg5independent manner, they may be inactive.

Having observed that Sor-induced cell death is
caspase-independent we examined whether necroptosis
is activated. Treatment of DU145 cells with the RIPK1
inhibitor, Necrostatin 1 (Nec-1), inhibited Sor-induced
cell death but had no effect in PC3 cells (Figure 4A)
[33]. Similarly, reconstitution of Atg5 expression in Atg5/- MEFs under the control of the doxycycline-regulated
system further demonstrated that the observed increased
death was due to the loss of Atg5 expression and that this
death can be partially protected by Nec-1 (Supplementary
Figure 7A and 7B). Furthermore, Nec-1 partially protected
PC3 cells from Sor-induced cell death, in which Atg5 was
knocked down with an siRNA (Supplementary Figure
7C). Transient knockdown of RIPK1, with a smartpool of
siRNAs, inhibited Sor-induced cell death and the addition
of Nec-1 further promoted the survival of DU145 cells
(Figure 4B and 4C). Importantly, ectopic expression of
Atg5 in DU145 cells protected from Sor-induced cell
death and co-treatment with Nec-1 further inhibited cell
death (Figure 4D).
Another major molecular player in the autophagic
cascade, mediating the lipidation of LC3 is Atg7. We
examined the total protein levels of Atg7 in DU145 and
PC3 cells. DU145 cells have lower Atg7 protein levels
than PC3 cells and Sor treatment does not have any effect
on them (Figure 4E). Silencing of Atg7 in DU145 had no
effect in Sor inducing cell death which was inhibited by
Nec-1 (Figure 4F and 4G). In contrast, PC3 cells with
lower Atg7 levels were more sensitive to Sor than the
siScr transfected cells and this cell death was not affected
by Nec-1 (Figure 4F and 4G).
We then examined whether the inhibition of Sorinduced cell death by Nec-1 was due to an indirect effect
on the autophagic machinery. The effect of Nec-1 on the
degradation of long-lived proteins was examined by flow
cytometry (Supplementary Figure 8A). We did not observe
any effects of Nec-1 either alone or in combination with
Sor. We also examined whether Nec-1 has any effect on
the formation of the GFP-LC3 positive foci induced by
Sor in DU145 cells. Nec-1 alone did not induce GFPLC3 foci and the combination of Nec-1 with Sor did not
change the number of cells with GFP-LC3 positive foci
compared to Sor alone (Supplementary Figure 8B and
8C). In summary these data indicate that Sor-induced cell
death in DU145 cells is due to the loss of Atg5 expression
and is mediated by necroptosis.

Re-constitution of ATG5 expression rescues
DU145 cells from Sor-induced cell death
The significance of the Atg5 loss of expression in
Sor-induced cell death was examined in DU145 cells by
transiently re-expressing Atg5 (Figure 3A). Reconstitution
of Atg5 expression rescued DU145 cells from Sor-induced
cell death (Figure 3B). These data were recapitulated in
Atg5-/- MEFs which, as observed with DU145 cells, were
more sensitive to Sor compared to WT cells and ectopic
expression of Atg5 leads to the re-constitution of LC3
lipidation and a decrease in Sor-induced cell death (Figure
3C and 3D). Collectively these data further demonstrate
that Sor-induced autophagy in Atg5 deficient cells is
cytotoxic and restoration of Atg5 expression protects the
cells from Sor-induced cell death.

Sorafenib-induced cell death in DU145 cells is
executed by necroptosis
To decipher the mode of cell death induced in
DU145 cells by Sor, we utilised the pancaspase inhibitor
zVAD.fmk and the caspase-9 inhibitor LEHD.fmk. We
found that Sor-induced cell death was not blocked by
either of these two inhibitors, in contrast to LNCaP cells
which were rescued from cell death (Supplementary
Figure 6A). We could not detect caspase-3 activity in
DU145 cells treated with Sor nor cleavage of the caspase
substrate PARP indicating that caspases are not activated
in response to Sor (Supplementary Figure 6B and 6C).
In addition, there were no changes in Bak, Bax, Bcl-xL
and AIF protein levels, nor any activation of Bak and Bax
detected, all of which indicate that Sor induced a caspaseindependent cell death in DU145 cells (Supplementary
Figure 6C, 6D and data not shown). This is in contrast
to 22Rv1 and PC3 PCa cells which undergo caspasedependent cell death in response to Sor [33].

p62 is required for Sorafenib induced necroptosis
in DU145 cells
The p62 is a ubiquitin-binding, scaffold protein
that plays a major role in delivering cytoplasmic cargo
targeted for degradation by autophagy. It has also been
shown that p62 acts as a scaffold protein for the activation
of RIPK1 and the NF-kB pathway [34]. In DU145, there

are accumulated protein levels of p62, a cellular response
usually associated with defective autophagic degradation
of p62 bound substrates. We hypothesised that p62 may
act as a signalling platform for the activation of RIPK1
and RIPK3 in response to Sor. Immunocytochemical
staining of DU145 cells for p62 and RIPK1 revealed
that, upon treatment with Sor, there is an increased colocalisation between these two proteins (Figure 5A).
Co-immunoprecipitation and the proximity ligation
assay (PLA) experiments further demonstrated that Sor
promotes the interaction between RIPK1 and p62 (Figure
5B, 5C and 5D). Importantly, this increased interaction
was not observed in PC3 cells as examined by confocal
microscopy (Supplementary Figure 9).
Having established that p62 interacts with
components of the necroptosome, we examined the role

of this interaction in Sor-induced autophagic cell death.
DU145 cells transiently transfected with control siRNA
(siScr), treatment with Sor did not change the intracellular
levels of RIPK1 (Figure 6A). In contrast, treatment of
PC3 cells with Sor decreased RIPK1 levels. Importantly,
knocking down p62 with a specific siRNA in DU145 cells
decreased the basal levels of RIPK1 protein suggesting
that p62 protects RIPK1 from degradation (Figure 6A).
Furthermore, silencing of p62 decreased the basal levels
of RIPK1 in DU145 cells, rendering Nec-1 ineffective in
blocking Sor-induced cell death (Figure 6B). To further
demonstrate the importance of p62 and RIPK1 in Sorinduced necroptosis we performed clonogenic assays in
DU145 cells. The colonies formed in Sor-treated DU145
cells transfected with siScr increased in the presence of
Nec-1. Knocking down of p62 significantly increased the

clonogenic survival of Sor-treated DU145 cells and Nec-1
did not have any further effect (Figure 6C and 6D). The
importance of p62 for autophagy-mediated necroptosis
was recapitulated with BafA1, where Nec-1 could no
longer block BafA1-induced caspase-independent cell
death in p62 depleted cells (Figure 6E).
To further investigate the involvement of necroptosis
in Sor-induced cell death we utilised RIPK3-/- MEF cells,
a major component and regulator of necroptosis. Wild
type MEF cells were sensitive to Sor. In contrast, RIPK3/- MEF cells were less sensitive to Sor and Nec-1 had no
effect on the levels of cell death (Figure 6F).

In a previous study, we described that sorafenib induces
caspase-dependent cell death in 22Rv1 and PC3 cell
lines and inhibition of autophagy potentiates the efficacy
of this TKI [28, 33]. In this study we provide evidence
that DU145 cells undergo caspase-independent cell death
in response to Sor and that this death is mediated by
autophagy.
It is known that apart from targeting multiple
tyrosine kinases, sorafenib directly impairs mitochondrial
function by acting as an uncoupler and inhibitor of state
II respiration [8]. Indeed, we found that sorafenib inhibits
mitochondrial respiration, decreases mitochondrial
membrane potential and the intracellular levels of ATP
within 4h of sorafenib treatment. Autophagy is the main
mechanism of protection against such intracellular damage
acting to remove the damaged mitochondria by a process
called mitophagy. We have found by time-lapse confocal
microscopy that the mitochondrial depolarisation precedes

DISCUSSION
Sorafenib, a type II TK inhibitor, is an attractive
TKI for the treatment of CRPC since it targets multiple
tyrosine kinase including VEGFR, PDGFR-β and Src.

the formation of GFP-LC3 foci which later on accumulate
and are sustained till the extensive vacuolisation and death
of the cell.
The formation of the GFP-LC3 foci is surprising
since these cells are deficient in Atg5 and the ensuing LC3
lipidation. It was previously demonstrated that mouse
cells lacking Atg5 or Atg7 can still form autophagosomes/
autophagolysosomes and perform autophagy-mediated
protein degradation when subjected to stressors such as
etoposide [35]. This Atg5/Atg7-independent autophagy
is not regulated by Ulk1 and Beclin1 but by Rab9, the
GTPase that drives the formation of the autophagosomes
in the absence of LC3. Our data do not support this model
since we have identified the presence of LC3 positive
foci in structures resembling autophagosomes by several
means: i) confocal microscopy against GFP-LC3 as well
as the endogenous levels of LC3; ii) GFP-RFP-LC3
positive foci; and iii) immunogold electron microscopy
for LC3. The presence of autophagic vacuoles in the
absence of LC3 lipidation has been reported in the Atg5-/purkinje cells which accumulate aberrant autophagosomelike double membrane structures prior to their death
[36]. However, these autophagosome-like structures
are not functional. In our experimental setting, we have
evidence that although Sor induces the formation of these
autophagosomal-like structures, they are not functional as
judged by i) the sustained high levels p62 protein levels;
ii) the lack of content in the immuno-electron microscopy
images; and iii) the increase in the amount of longlived proteins in response to Sor. Thus, we believe that
DU145 cells in an attempt to alleviate the mitochondrial
and other intracellular damages inflicted by Sor, evoke
an autophagic response which due to the lack of Atg5 is
defective or inefficient. In an alternative setting, it may
be that Sor has a direct effect on the lysosomes rendering
them inactive which could explain the accumulation of
GFP-RFP-LC3 positive vacuoles.
The reconstitution of Atg5 expression in DU145
cells rescued the cells from Sor-induced cell death in a
similar manner as ULK-1 and Beclin1 silencing. Similar
findings we had with Atg5-/- MEF and the re-expression
of Atg5 which also rescued them from Sor-induced
caspase-independent cell death. DU145 cells may have
adopted to survive under basal stress conditions and
organellar turnover by activating alternative modes of
autophagy such as Atg5/Atg7 independent autophagy,
micro-autophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy.
However when confronted with the massive mitochondrial
damage as that induced by Sor they activate the classical
autophagic pathway which is inefficient and defective due
to the lack of Atg5 and LC3 lipidation.
Autophagy has a dual role in tumor initiation,
progression and metastasis. It has been shown that
autophagy may act as a tumor suppressive mechanism at
the early stages of tumorigenesis and as a tumor promoting
mechanism at the stages of tumor growth and metastasis.

In both scenarios, however, autophagy acts as homeostatic,
cytoprotective mechanism and this is exploited by cancer
cells to their advantage. We examined the frequency of
Atg5 loss in prostate cancer patients by performing a
tissue micro array and stained for intracellular Atg5 levels
by immunohistochemistry. We found that in the majority
of the clinical samples there is high expression of Atg5 and
there was no correlation with the Gleason score (Figure
7). These findings are in agreement with a previous study
where Kim et al., also found overexpression of Atg5 in
the majority of the prostate cancer patient samples [37].
However, in our study we detected the loss of Atg5
expression in 18% of the CRPC patients. Similar findings
where obtained in 21% of gastrointestinal cancer patients
demonstrating loss of Atg5 expression [38]. Furthermore,
the down-regulation of Atg5 expression has been shown in
colorectal cancer and early cutaneous melanoma patients
with prognostic and diagnostic implications [39, 40].
The tumor growth promoting benefits of Atg5 or Atg7
loss of expression has also been demonstrated in several
experimental models, such as in the BRAFV600E driven lung
carcinomas or in the KRASG12D or driven pancreatic cancer
[41, 42]. Our observation that cancer cells that have lost
the expression of Atg5 may undergo deficient or inefficient
autophagy in response to cytotoxic insults has important
clinical implications. Treatment of cancer cells with
autophagy inhibitors (e.g. hydroxochloroquine, Lys05 or
Vps34 inhibitors) often ameliorates the efficacy of cancer
therapy but in cells with deficient autophagy may promote
the survival of these cells [43]. However, in a subset of
patients where autophagy may be defective, inefficient and
may promote cell death, alternative strategies are required,
such that will promote and induce autophagy in order to
increase the intracellular stress to the point of no return.
Thus, this particular subset of patients would benefit from
inducers of autophagy as a combination therapy like the
mTOR inhibitors (e.g. rapalogues) or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
antagonists (e.g. ABT737 or obatoclax).
There are several reports indicating that autophagy
may promote or act as a cell death mechanism in
response to anti-cancer drugs [18, 19, 21]. The
mechanisms by which autophagy would promote or
mediate caspase-independent cell death are not clearly
defined. Interestingly, the interplay between mitophagy
and necroptosis has been previously reported [44].
Furthermore, it has been previously shown that autophagy
inhibits necroptosis by promoting the degradation of
RIPK1 [22]. The recent demonstration of the importance
of Atg5 in the activation of the necrosome in response
to Obatoclax-induced autophagic cell death provide
further evidence of the extensive cross-talk between the
autophagic and the necroptosis machinery [21]. In this
study we show that necroptosis is the mechanism by
which DU145 cells undergoing Atg5-deficient autophagy
succumb to sorafenib. Pre-treatment of DU145 cells with
necrostatin-1 potently inhibited cell death induced by
37076

sorafenib. Furthermore, MEF cells deficient in RIPK3
are less sensitive to sorafenib compared to wt cells and
this death is necrostatin-independent. In this setting
we propose that Atg5-deficient autophagy allows for
the accumulation of p62 protein levels that promote
the formation of the necrosome and the activation of
the RIPK1/RIPK3 necroptotic cell death pathway. This
hypothesis is supported by the data showing that in DU145
cells, the interaction of p62 with RIPK1 is induced upon
sorafenib treatment and that knockdown of p62 leads not
only to the downregulation of RIPK1 protein levels but
also renders DU145 cells insensitive to necrostatin-1.
However, further experiments are required to determine
the molecular regulation and significance of these findings.
In summary, we provide evidence that defective
or inefficient autophagy will lead to the accumulation of
p62 protein levels which upon intracellular damage or
stress may act as a signalling platform for the activation
of necroptosis as a mode of cell death. From a therapeutic
point of view, we provide evidence that sorafenib, a drug
that is currently on clinical trials for prostate cancer and
used for hepatocellular and renal cancers, may kill cancer
cells by necroptosis when autophagy is defective or
deficient. This finding provides a rationale for screening
of patients for an intact autophagic machinery since
such characterisation would reveal the most efficient
therapeutic modalities in a personalised manner. It
follows that treatment of patients that lack or have mutant
key autophagy regulators would benefit from novel
combination treatments with agents that promote the
induction of autophagy such as the rapamycin analogues
and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 antagonists.

(FLUOS) (Roche, 14461000) [45, 46]. Briefly, 2 x 105
cells per sample were collected, washed in PBS, pelleted,
and re-suspended in incubation buffer (10 mM HEPES/
NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2) containing
1% Annexin V and PI. Samples were kept in the dark and
incubated for 10 minutes prior to addition of another 400
µl of incubation buffer and subsequent analysis on Calibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San José, CA, USA)
using Cell Quest software.
To detect sorafenib-induced changes in
mitochondrial membrane potential, cell were stained with
tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE;
Molecular Probes Inc. T699) as previously described [47].
Briefly, 1 nM TMRE was added to 106 cells and incubated
for 30 minutes. After washing the cells in PBS and TMRE,
they were incubated for 10 minutes in the dark in 100 μl
of incubation buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140
mM NaCl, 5 mM CaC12, 25 nM TMRE) containing 1%
Annexin V FLUOS. Prior to flow cytometric analysis,
another 400 μl of incubation buffer was added. Staining
was detected by FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, San José, CA, USA) and the data analysed with
the CellQuest software, provided by Becton Dickinson.

Cells (4 × 106) were harvested, and resuspended in 300
μl of medium. After closing the lid, mitochondrial State
3 respiration was monitored for 3-4 minutes. State 4
respiration was attained after addition of oligomycin (2.5
µg/ml), an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase. The
maximum activity of the respiratory chain (uncoupled
respiration) was assessed after addition of a protonophore,
carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP 5
µM).

ATP measurements
For ATP content determination DU145 cells were
harvested, collected and lysed using ATP releasing buffer
(Sigma). The concentration of ATP was quantified by
using the ATP Bioluminescent Assay Kit (Sigma, FLAA1KT) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunocytochemistry and time lapse microscopy
The cytotoxic effects of sorafenib on DU145 cell
lines was analysed by staining of mitochondria with
MitoTracker (Mol. Probes, Inc., M7514) and co-staining
with an antibody against cytochrome c as previously
described [49]. Briefly, for mitochondrial staining, cells
were cultured in 12-well plate containing sterile cover
slips for 24h, just before staining they were incubated
for 30 minutes in normal growth medium containing
5 µm MitoTracker (Mol. Probes, Inc.) and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min, permeabilized
using digitonin (10 µg/ml) diluted in PBS for 10 minutes
and stained with anti-cytochrome c antibodies for 1h
at room temperature, followed by rabbit-anti-mouse
FITC-conjugated antibodies (DAKO, F0261). For the
intracellular stainings of p62 (mouse) and RIPK1 (rabbit),
cells were fixed with PFA 4% PFA and permeabilised with
digitonin for 10 min. The cells were then stained with
anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and anti-mouse 594. The images
were recorded on a DAS Leitz DM RB microscope with
a Hamamatsu C4880 dual-mode cooled CCD camera and
further processed using Photoshop software (Adobe).
Time lapse confocal microscope was performed. For
the time lapse confocal microscopy, DU145 cells stably
transfected with GFP-LC3 were stained with mitotracker
as aforementioned and placed in the confocal microscope
time-lapse with heated chamber, lense, stage and provision
of 5% CO. Images were captured every hour for 24h.

Transmission and immuno-electron microscopy
DU145 cells were incubated with 20 µM sorafenib

sections were incubated in 8% H2O2, washed in dH2O and
incubated in 0.01M PBS pH7.4 and blocked with 5% goat
serum (X0907, Dako, Denmark) in PBS for 30 minutes.
Sections were then incubated with LC3 mouse monoclonal
antibody (MBL, M152-3) in a dilution of 1:10 in PBS
containing 1% BSA for 20h at 4oC. Subsequently sections
were incubated in 0.05M Tris/HCl pH7.4, 0.05M Tris/HCl
pH7.2 : 0.2% BSA (1:1) and finally in 0.05M Tris/HCl
pH8.2 : 1% BSA (1:1) followed by incubation with 10nm
colloidal gold conjugated secondary antibody in a dilution
1:10 for 1h at RT. They were then washed in 0.05M Tris/
HCl pH7.2 : 0.2% BSA (1:1), 0.05M Tris/HCl pH7.4 and
dH2O and dried on blotting paper and stained in 7.5%
Uranyl Acetate ethanol solution and then in 0.4% Lead
Citrate aqueous solution at RT. Sections were visualized

μl of separated protein were run on a SDS-PAGE gel and
20 μg of cell lysate run as input.

Assessment of autophagy

Proximity ligation assay (PLA)

For the GFP-LC3 experiments, DU145 cells
were transfected by 4μg of pEGFP-LC3 plasmid using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668-019) based on
manufacturer’s recommendation [50]. Twenty four hours
after transfection the growth media was replaced by
complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418
(Sigma) for selection. EGFP-LC3 positive cells were
selected by MoFlo™ XDP Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter)
and cultured for 3 weeks under G418 selection pressure.
Following treatment, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA
and mounted using Vectashield with DAPI. The images
were recorded on a Zeiss Axioplan-2 microscope with
a Zeiss dual mode cooled CCD camera and Axiovision
software 4.1.

For the proximity ligation assay, the Duolink® In
Situ Detection Reagents Red (Sigma, DU092008) to was
used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
the DU145 cells were cultured on cover slips, treated with
20 μM sorafenib for 24h, fixed with 4% PFA and then
permeabilized using digitonin as described above. RIPK
(mouse) and p62 (rabbit) antibody were used as primary
antibody. After 1h incubation, cells were washed twice and
PLA probe MINUS and PLA probe PLUS were added and
incubated for 1h at 37° C. After washing, ligation reaction
was done for 30 minutes and the amplification was run
for 100 minutes. Then the cells were washed, mounted
and captured by using the LSM 510; Carl Zeiss confocal
microscope. The Zeiss AIM user interface software
was used to process the images to a two-dimensional
illustration of the summary of all dots in each cell Zeiss
550 confocal microscope.

Long lived protein degradation assay
The Click-iT® AHA Alexa Fluor® 488 Protein
Synthesis HCS Assay (L-Azidohomoalanine) (Invitrogen,
C10289) kit was used, as previously described [32].
Briefly, 20,000 cells were plated in a 96-well plate
overnight. The cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with L-methionine free medium (Gibco,
21013-024) for 30 minutes. Afterwards, Click-iT® AHA
(L-azidohomoalanine) reagent (component A) was added
for 18 hours. The cells were washed with complete
DMEM medium for 2 hours, in order to chase out short
lived proteins and were treated with the indicated drugs
for 24 hours. The cells were washed with PBS followed
by fixation with 4% PFA for 15 minutes. The cells were
washed with 3% BSA and permeabilised with digitonin
(10 μg/ml) for 20 minutes. Next, the cells were washed
again with 3% BSA and received Click-iT® AHA supermix
(Component B) and Click-iT® AHA buffer additive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Clonogenic assays
One hundred DU145 cells were plated and cell
transfected with either siScr or siRNA against p62. After
24h cells were treated by 50 µM Necrostatin-1 and/or 20
µM sorafenib for 24h. After 10 days the clones were fixed,
stained with crystal violet and counted.

Prostate cancer tissue microarray
A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from
a series of 41 radical prostatectomy specimens collected
in 2003 at Karolinska Hospital, Solna, Sweden. The
37079

Oncotarget

patients underwent surgery for primary adenocarcinoma
of the prostate. None of them had received hormonal
therapy or radiotherapy, prior to surgery. After fixation,
the prostate was inked, sliced horizontally at 4 mm and
totally embedded. The specimens were dehydrated,
paraffin embedded, cut into 4 μm sections and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. The TMA was constructed using
a Beecher, Manual Arrayer I (Beecher Instruments Inc,
Sun Prairie, WI, USA). A representative tumor core with
a diameter of 1 mm was collected from the main tumor of
each specimen and another core was taken from benign
tissue, usually within benign prostatic hyperplasia in the
transition zone. Intensity and extent of immunoreactivity
and their product (IR) were evaluated in each core by a
trained pathologist (LE). The material was evaluated at
two occasions with a two-week interval. The intensity was
scored from 0 (no staining) to 3 (most intense staining)
based on the strongest staining of the core. The extent
of positive intracytoplasmic staining was evaluated
in a semiquantitative manner. Scoring was based on
percentage of stained epithelial cells and graded from 1
to 3, signifying 1-33%, 34-66%, and > 66%, respectively.
