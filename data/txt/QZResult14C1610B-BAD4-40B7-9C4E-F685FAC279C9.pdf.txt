Abstract
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a highly aggressive
form of the disease for which new therapeutic options are
desperately needed. Previously, we showed that the highaffinity peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor ; (PPAR;)
agonist, RS5444, inhibits cell proliferation of ATC cells via
induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1
(p21). We show here that up-regulation of RhoB is a critical
step in PPAR;-mediated activation of p21-induced cell stasis.
Using multiple independently derived ATC cell lines, we found
that treatment with RS5444 leads to the up-regulation of RhoB
and subsequent activation of p21, and that silencing of RhoB
by RNAi blocks the ability of RS5444 to induce p21 and to
inhibit cell proliferation. Our results show that transcriptional
regulation of RhoB by the nuclear transcription factor
PPAR; is responsible for the induction of p21 mRNA and
protein. We further implicate RhoB as a key signaling effector
for the growth inhibition of ATC, as treatment with a histone
deacetylase inhibitor shown to increase RhoB expression in
lung cancer cells caused the up-regulation of RhoB in ATC
cells accompanied by increased expression of p21 and
inhibition of cell proliferation; this effect occurred even in
ATC cells that were unresponsive to RS5444 due to a lack of
expression of PPAR;. Our results implicate RhoB as a novel
intermediate in critical signaling pathways and as an
additional target for therapeutic intervention in ATC. [Cancer

Introduction
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer with an
approximate incidence rate of 33,550 newly diagnosed cases per
year in the United States (1). Despite a generally good prognosis,
more than 1,500 patients with thyroid cancer die of their disease
annually. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most poorly
differentiated, highly aggressive form of thyroid cancer with a

median survival of f4 months, a 1-year survival rate of <10%, and
99% lethality overall. If detected early, extensive surgery combined
with radiotherapy offers the best chance of local disease control.
To date, chemotherapy (usually doxorubicin plus cisplatin or
paclitaxel) has shown only palliative benefit in advanced ATC
(reviewed in ref. 2), but neither agent has shown curative potential.
More effective targeted therapies based on a better understanding
of the molecular and cellular signaling pathways disrupted in ATC
are therefore needed.
Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor g (PPARg) agonists
have chemopreventive and antitumor activity against a variety of
human cancers associated with transcriptional activation of PPARg
(3–6). These findings are in keeping with the hypothesis that
PPARg can act as a tumor suppressor in several cancers including
thyroid cancer (7, 8). Mechanisms of PPARg-mediated antitumor
activity include the induction of differentiation, promotion of cell
cycle arrest, antiangiogenic effects, and induction of apoptosis (9).
In more differentiated thyroid cancers, PPARg agonists have been
shown to induce apoptosis through cytochrome c/caspase 3 and
PTEN-Akt pathways (10).
We and others have recently shown that the PPARg agonist,
RS5444, inhibits cell proliferation and induces tumor differentiation
(9, 11, 12). In our previous work, we found that RS5444 inhibited
ATC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo but did not induce
apoptosis as a single agent (9). We showed that RS5444 is
dependent on PPARg for its antitumor activity because GW9662, a
pharmacologic antagonist of PPARg, blocked the inhibition of cell
growth by RS5444 (9). We also found that the cyclin kinase
inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 (p21) was up-regulated by RS5444. To date,
p21 has been implicated as a modulator of PPARg-mediated
inhibition of cell proliferation, but this evidence has been limited to
correlative observations (13–16). In our recent study, we found that
p21 was required for PPARg-mediated growth inhibition by RS5444
in ATC cells, and that combinatorial treatment of ATC cells with
RS5444 and paclitaxel resulted in apoptotic synergy. Silencing
experiments showed the requirement of p21 for this observed
synergy (9), but the mechanism by which PPARg agonists might
up-regulate p21 remains unknown.
RhoB is a member of the Ras superfamily of isoprenylated small
GTPases, which regulate actin stress fibers and vesicle transport
(17, 18). Membrane association of RhoB occurs through either
geranylgeranylated (RhoB-GG) or farnesylated (RhoB-F) modifications. RhoB is required for apoptosis in transformed cells that are
exposed to farnesyltransferase inhibitors, DNA-damaging agents,
or paclitaxel (19). In cancer cells, RhoB modulates proliferation,
survival, invasion, and angiogenic capacity (17). RhoB is not
mutated in cancer, but its altered expression and activity seem

RhoB in ATC

crucial to cancer progression and therapeutic responses. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors up-regulate RhoB levels and this upregulation of RhoB can mediate phenotypic reversion, growth
inhibition, cytoskeletal actin reorganization, and apoptosis (20).
We now define a sequential pathway whereby the thiazolidinedione RS5444 acts via a PPARg-dependent mechanism to upregulate RhoB leading to increased expression of p21 followed by
attenuation of cell proliferation. The elaboration of this novel
signaling pathway triggered by PPARg agonists provides insight
into how to target such agents for treatment of ATC. We now
show that the high-affinity histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor,
FK228 (a.k.a. romidepsin), previously shown to stimulate RhoB
expression in lung cancer cell lines (21), also inhibits ATC cell
proliferation via p21 in a RhoB-dependent fashion. These results
identify RhoB up-regulation as a key step for targeting ATC cell
proliferation and tumor progression.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. PPARg agonists RS5444 and troglitazone were kindly
provided by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. GW9662 was purchased from SigmaAldrich, FK228 (NSC 630176, depsipeptide or romidepsin) was a gift from
Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cambridge, MA) and the Division of
Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute. Rosiglitazone
was obtained from ChemPacific.
Cell culture. DRO90-1 (DRO) and ARO81 (ARO) ATC cell lines were
kindly provided by Dr. G.J. Juillard (University of California, Los Angeles,
CA) as were KTC2 and KTC3 ATC cell lines by Dr. Junichi Kurebayashi of
Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan (22). Please note that a recent
publication indicates that DRO and ARO cell lines may be of questionable
thyroid origin (23). THJ-16T and THJ-11T cells were established in the
Copland laboratory and derived from human ATC tumor tissues received
from Dr. Trad Wadsworth (East Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA) and
Dr. Clive Grant (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 (Cellgro) and proliferation studies with 10 nmol/L of RS5444 and
1 ng/mL of FK228 were done as previously described (9, 24). For morphology studies, cells were plated in 12-well plates at initial concentrations
of 2.5  104 cells/well. Cells were treated with either DMSO or 10 nmol/L of
RS5444 (24 h). After treatment, phase images were obtained on an inverted
microscope (Olympus IX71, C Squared Corporation). For real-time PCR
studies, cells were plated in 60 mm plates at 50% confluence and treated
with 10 nmol/L of RS5444 for the indicated incubation periods. For
immunoblotting analyses, cells were plated in 60 mm plates at
initial concentrations of 3  105 cells/plate and were treated with either
10 nmol/L of RS5444, 100 nmol/L of rosiglitazone, 1 Amol/L of troglitazone,
10 Amol/L of GW9662, 1 ng/mL of FK228, or indicated combinations for
indicated incubation periods.
Lentiviral infection. Lentiviral constructs for the packaging of selfinactivating lentiviruses were made in the pLKO.1 vector (Sigma-Aldrich).
The target sequence for PPARg was 5¶-GACAACAGACAAATCACCATT-3¶
and a random scrambled sequence was used for the nontarget vector
(Sigma-Aldrich). Lentiviruses were produced by transient transfection in
293FT cells (Invitrogen) using ViraPower (Invitrogen) and LipofectAMINE
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Target
ATC cells were plated in 10 cm plates and grown to 70% confluence for
the infection of the lentivirus, along with 5 Ag/mL of polybrene according to
the protocols of the manufacturer. After 48 h, 2 Ag/mL of puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added for the selection of infected cells expressing
short hairpin RNA (shRNA).
Luciferase reporter gene analysis. Specific activation of PPRE3-tk-luc
(R. Evans, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) by RS5444 was shown by dual
luciferase assay. An 1876 bp RhoB promoter-luciferase (Daniel Tovar,
Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France) was also examined for
responsiveness to 10 nmol/L of RS5444 or 1 ng/mL of FK228. Cells were
transfected, treated with DMSO control (1:1,000), 10 nmol/L of RS5444, or

www.aacrjournals.org

1 ng/mL of FK228 for 24 h and then luciferase activity was measured as
previously described (9).
siRNA transfection. Cells were either plated in triplicate at 4.0  104
cells/mL in six-well plates or 2  104 cells/well in 12-well plates, allowed
to adhere overnight, and then transfected for 24 to 72 h with 2 to 5 Ag of
either scrambled, or RhoB-specific siRNA duplexes (SI00058933 RhoB 1,
SI00058912 RhoB 3, or SI00058926 RhoB 4; Qiagen) using RNAiFect reagent
(Qiagen). After transfection, cells in the six-well plates were treated with
either DMSO, 10 nmol/L of RS5444, or 1 ng/mL of FK228 for 24 h and then
analyzed by either real-time PCR or immunoblotting. Cells in the 12-well
plates were exposed for 6 days with medium and drug changed every 48 h.
After 6 days, cells were washed with PBS (Cellgro), trypsinized, and counted
with a Beckman Coulter Counter.
Cell lysis and immunoblotting. Cellular lysates and tumor tissue
extractions were collected, analyzed for protein concentration, and
transferred to Immobilon-P membranes as previously described (9).
The membranes were hybridized with antibodies (Santa Cruz, Cell
Signaling, Sigma-Aldrich) as indicated overnight at 4jC followed by
treatment with species-specific horseradish peroxidase IgG (The Jackson
Laboratory) for 45 min at room temperature. Detection was performed
using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Protein
expression from Western analysis was quantitated (Image Quant 5.0
Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare) and mean F SD is reported for
replicates of three.
Plasmids. pcDNA3.1 was purchased from Invitrogen and pcDNA3.1dominant negative RhoB was kindly provided by Séverine Steuve (Free
University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium). The RhoB promoter linked to a
luciferase reporter gene plasmid (hRB rhoB promoter/luciferase, 1876 bp)
was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Tovar (Institut Claudius Regaud,
Toulouse, France). For transient transfection, cells were plated in 60 mm
plates and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for
24 h followed by an additional 24 h, after which cells were treated with
10 nmol/L of RS5444, 1 ng/mL of FK228, or DMSO. Cells were then collected
and mRNA was isolated using RNAqueous (Ambion).
RNA isolation, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.
Total mRNA was isolated from cells using RNAqueous (Ambion) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by ethanol precipitation. Two-step
quantitative reverse transcriptase–mediated real-time PCR was used to
measure changes in the mRNA levels of target genes in ATC cells as
previously described (9). Applied Biosystems’ assays-on-demand assay
mix of primers and TaqMan MGB probes (FAM dye-labeled) for RhoB
(Hs00269660_s1), RhoA (Hs00357608_m1), RhoC (Hs00237129_m1), Rac1
(Hs00251654_m1), cdc42 (Hs00741586_mH), p21 (CDKN1A Hs00355782_m1),
and 18S rRNA (Hs99999901_s1) were used for quantitative PCR measurements. Data was normalized to 18s rRNA for each sample. Fold change
values between treated (RS5444 or FK228) and control samples were
calculated using the DDCt method (25).
Xenograft studies. Tumor implantation of DRO, ARO, and THJ-11T cells
for xenograft studies were performed as previously described (9).
Cell death analysis. Cells were plated and grown to 50% confluence in
100 mm plates followed by 24 h of treatment with either DMSO control,
10 nmol/L of RS5444, 1 ng/mL of FK228, or 0.8% TX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Medium was collected and TX-100 samples were serially diluted as
standards for cell death percentage. Medium was plated and incubated
with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; Thermoelectron) at 1:10 for 30 min in the
dark and then the absorbance was read at 340 nm on a Spectrophotometer
(Molecular Devices). For 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) studies, cells
were plated on slides at 50% confluence overnight and then incubated
in DAPI (Dako) for 3 min followed by washing with PBS + 0.05% Tween.
Apoptosis was characterized by positive DAPI staining and three
microscopic fields in each group were used to calculate the percentage
of DAPI-positive cells. All slides were analyzed under fluorescence
light obtained by an Olympus microscope (Olympus IX71, C Squared
Corporation).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean F SD and
comparisons of treatment groups were analyzed by two-tailed paired
Student’s t test. Data for comparison of multiple groups are presented as

Results
Regulation of cell proliferation by RS5444 is PPAR;
dependent. We previously showed that DRO cells were growthinhibited by 10 nmol/L of RS5444 through a PPARg-dependent
mechanism (9). We now confirm and extend this finding to four
human cell lines (DRO, ARO, KTC2, and KTC3) that have been
engineered to stably express lentiviral shRNA against PPARg
(Fig. 1A). Cells silenced for PPARg expression (PPARg shRNA)
expressed little or no PPARg as compared with nontarget lentiviral
shRNA control cells (Fig. 1B ). Cells were then tested for
transcriptional response to PPARg by transient transfection of
PPRE-tk-luciferase as a transcriptional reporter for PPARg and
showed loss of transcriptional response to 10 nmol/L of RS5444
(Fig. 1C). These results show that PPARg-induced growth
inhibition is a general property of ATC cells.
PPAR; agonists up-regulate RhoB expression, which is
dependent on PPAR;. We observed altered cellular morphology
following treatment with 10 nmol/L of RS5444 (Fig. 2A), which led
us to examine the potential involvement of members of the
RhoGTPase family of small GTPases, as these are known to play
roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (17). Because the primary
effects of PPARg are at the level of transcriptional regulation of

target genes, we used real-time PCR to rapidly screen for changes
in mRNA levels of the members of the RhoGTPase family, and
found that RS5444 consistently up-regulated RhoB expression in all
four cell lines examined (Fig. 2A). Up-regulation of RhoB protein
was shown in DRO and KTC2 cells treated for 24 h with 10 nmol/L
of RS5444 or two related thiazolidinedione PPARg agonists,
100 nmol/L of rosiglitazone, and 1 Amol/L of troglitazone
(Fig. 2B). These effects were confirmed to be dependent on PPARg,
as pretreatment of cells with 10 Amol/L of GW9662, an irreversible
pharmacologic inhibitor of PPARg, blocked the induction of RhoB
(Fig. 2B), as did shRNA silencing of PPARg (Fig. 2C). We also
investigated these effects in mouse xenograft models in which we
previously identified tumor growth inhibition of established tumors
and up-regulation of p21 as a result of 0.025% RS5444 treatment (9),
and found that RhoB expression was strongly up-regulated in
DRO and ARO tumors excised from mice chronically treated with
0.025% RS5444 in the diet for 4 weeks (Fig. 2D). We confirmed
this finding in an ATC cell line (THJ-11T) created in our laboratory
(Fig. 2D). These results show that increased expression of RhoB is
a general response to the activation of PPARg in ATC cells.
RS5444 growth arrest is mediated via RhoB. As RhoB has
been shown to possess antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity
in other types of cancer cells (26), we assessed the role of RhoB
in the inhibition of ATC cell growth by PPARg (Fig. 3). Cells
transfected with scrambled siRNA respond to 10 nmol/L of RS5444
with the up-regulation of RhoB protein (Fig. 3A). Cells transfected

blocked PPARg-mediated transcription as shown in these same cell lines that were transiently transfected with a PPRE3-tk-luc reporter and treated with 10 nmol/L

RhoB in ATC

Figure 2. Changes in morphology and induction of RhoB is PPARg dependent. A, live microscopic images of KTC2 and KTC3 cell lines treated with and without
10 nmol/L of RS5444 for 24 h (magnification, 40) revealed altered morphologies. Real-time PCR for multiple RhoGTPases in cell lines treated with RS5444 for
24 h showed an increase of RhoB mRNA with no appreciable alteration in mRNA levels of the other RhoGTPases. Experiments were performed in triplicate. *, P < 0.05
when compared with untreated control. B, three thiazolidinedione PPARg agonists (10 nmol/L RS5444, 100 nmol/L rosiglitazone, 1 mmol/L troglitazone) induced
RhoB protein expression in DRO and KTC2 cells examined 24 h after treatment. When the irreversible PPARg antagonist GW9662 was added 5 min prior to
thiazolidinedione treatment, induction of RhoB was blocked, demonstrating specificity for PPARg. C, Western analysis of lentivirally infected DRO and KTC2 cells
silenced for PPARg illustrates a lack of RhoB up-regulation in the absence of PPARg when treated with RS5444. D, Western analysis showed induction of RhoB
expression in tumors (DRO, ARO, and THJ-11T) grown in athymic nude mice following chronic oral treatment (4 weeks) with 0.025% of RS5444 versus that of vehicle
control. Results from three random animals from each group.

with RhoB siRNA and treated with RS5444 showed RhoB levels
similar to that of scrambled untreated controls (Fig. 3A). Silencing
RhoB expression revealed that all four lines were RhoB dependent
for RS5444-induced growth arrest (Fig. 3B). Scrambled siRNAtreated cells were growth inhibited by 70% to 80% after exposure
to 10 nmol/L of RS5444 over 6 days with media changes and
the addition of 10 nmol/L of RS5444 every 48 hours (Fig. 3B).
Conversely, cells silenced for RhoB expression showed significantly
less growth inhibition when exposed to RS5444 (Fig. 3B). These
results show that RhoB is an essential intermediate in PPARgmediated growth inhibition of ATC cells.
p21 up-regulation is RhoB dependent. We previously discovered that RS5444 up-regulated p21 protein levels in a PPARg-

www.aacrjournals.org

dependent fashion and that growth arrest was p21 dependent (9).
Here, we tested whether the induction of p21 by RS5444 was
dependent on RhoB. We confirmed in all four cell lines that a
24-hour treatment with 10 nmol/L of RS5444 up-regulates p21
mRNA and protein (Fig. 4A). These events were rapid because
RhoB mRNA levels in DRO cells were elevated 2-fold after 2 hours
and were higher than 8-fold by 24 hours post-RS5444 treatment
compared to time-matched vehicle controls (Fig. 4B); p21 mRNA
levels were elevated 2-fold at 4 hours post-RS5444 treatment and
7-fold at 24 hours compared to controls (Fig. 4C) indicating that
RS5444 transcriptionally up-regulates RhoB and p21. RhoB protein
levels are elevated after 4 hours whereas p21 is elevated by
6 hours, and remain elevated 48 hours after a single treatment

of RS5444 in DRO cells (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these data show that
RhoB mRNA and protein are up-regulated by RS5444 before that
of p21, suggesting that increased expression of RhoB is upstream
of p21 up-regulation. Consistent with this interpretation, we found
that silencing RhoB in DRO and KTC2 cells significantly blocked
the up-regulation of p21 mRNA by RS5444 (Fig. 5A). Similarly,
expression of dominant-negative RhoB also blocked RS5444induced up-regulation of p21 mRNA (Fig. 5B).
We next evaluated the effect of RhoB silencing on protein
expression levels of RhoB, p21, and RhoA (Fig. 5C). We found that
silencing RhoB had no effect on protein expression for RhoA,
demonstrating siRNA specificity, and that stimulation with RS5444
in scrambled siRNA transfected cells showed up-regulation of
RhoB and p21 protein (Fig. 5C). Moreover, we found that RhoB
siRNA inhibited the induction of p21 protein levels by RS5444.
These results show that RhoB is necessary for p21 mRNA and
protein up-regulation by RS5444 (Fig. 5C).
HDAC inhibitor FK228 also up-regulates RhoB. Our results
showed that increased expression of RhoB is an essential upstream
step for PPARg/p21-dependent inhibition of ATC proliferation,
and in doing so, we identified RhoB as a novel point of therapeutic
intervention in ATC. We next wished to test whether this
information could be used to identify PPARg-independent therapeutic approaches for targeting ATC. Previous investigators found
that HDACs suppress RhoB expression in human non–small cell
lung carcinoma cell lines and that HDAC inhibitors up-regulate
RhoB (21, 27). We found that KTC3 cells transfected with scrambled
or three different RhoB siRNAs showed RhoB siRNA 4 almost
completely inhibited the pan-HDAC inhibitor, FK228, from inducing
RhoB mRNA whereas RhoB siRNA 3 showed modest inhibition and
RhoB siRNA 1 showed no inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cell
proliferation of KTC3 cells using these same siRNAs illustrated

differential growth effects when treated with 1 ng/mL of FK228
based on the ability of the siRNA to silence RhoB (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Using scrambled siRNA, cells respond to FK228 with upregulation of RhoB and p21 protein whereas cells transfected with
RhoB siRNA 4 show silenced RhoB and lack of p21 up-regulation in
response to FK228 (Fig. 6A), and that knockdown of RhoB
significantly inhibited FK228-induced growth arrest (Fig. 6B).
These results suggest that HDAC inhibitor–based therapies
could be effective against ATC that are unresponsive to PPARg
agonists. To test this possibility, we evaluated the response to
FK228 in THJ-16T cells, which is a cell line derived from a primary
ATC tumor in our laboratory. THJ-16T cells express no PPARg
and do not show up-regulation of RhoB or inhibition of cell
proliferation in response to RS5444 (Fig. 6C). However, THJ-16T
cells do show up-regulation of RhoB and p21 in response to FK228
and silencing of RhoB expression attenuates FK228-dependent
inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Our novel discovery that PPARg up-regulates RhoB in ATC cells
was prompted by RS5444-mediated alterations in cell morphology
coupled with supporting literature demonstrating that enhanced
RhoB activity was associated with growth inhibition and elevated
p21 (17, 28, 29). RhoA and RhoC share f86% amino acid homology
with RhoB and also mediate actin stress fiber formation. Other
RhoGTPases, which include Rac1 and Cdc42, have been found to
promote oncogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (30, 31). However,
RhoB is antiproliferative and proapoptotic in cancer cells (32), and
overexpression of RhoB can inhibit cell migration, invasion, and
metastasis (33). In head and neck, lung, and brain cancers, RhoB
levels are decreased with tumor progression suggesting that

Figure 3. RhoB up-regulation by RS5444 is necessary for the inhibition of ATC proliferation. A, cell lines were examined by Western analysis to verify that RhoB
expression remained silenced even in the presence of RS5444. Cells were transfected for 24 h with scrambled (Scr ) and RhoB siRNA and treated with 10 nmol/L of
RS5444 for 24 h. B, cellular proliferation of these transiently transfected cell lines showed that growth inhibition is RhoB dependent. Columns, cell numbers were

RhoB in ATC

induction after 10 nmol/L of RS5444 treatment for 24 h. Fold change values were calculated between treated and control samples; columns, mean; bars, SD

C, real-time PCR of p21 mRNA in DRO cells showed induction by 4 h. Data was normalized to 18S; points, mean; bars, SD (n = 4). *, P < 0.05 when compared
with controls. D, immunoblotting of DRO cells treated with RS5444 showed up-regulation of RhoB protein by 4 h and p21 protein by 6 h. No change in RhoA protein
occurred between control and RS5444-treated cells.

silencing this pathway is critical to tumor survival and progression
(34–36). Our data show that RhoB mRNA and protein levels are low
in ATC cell lines with up-regulation following exposure to RS5444
or FK228.
We found that RS5444 regulates RhoB at the transcriptional level
with rapid up-regulation of RhoB mRNA by 2 hours of treatment
and in protein levels by 4 hours. We identified two putative PPARg
response elements ( 1302 to 1282 and 1422 to 1402) in the
RhoB promoter with 70% to 80% homology to a consensus PPARg
response element (PPRE). However, transient transfection of the
RhoB promoter linked to a luciferase reporter (1876 bp promoter
fragment) in DRO, KTC2, and KTC3 did not lead to the induction
of luciferase activity after 24 hours of treatment with 10 nmol/L
of RS5444, even though treatment with 1 ng/mL of FK228 induced
luciferase activity 3-fold to 9-fold (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus,
the transcriptional regulation of RhoB by PPARg may be regulated
by another region of the RhoB gene or by a more complicated
mechanism involving structured chromatin complexes not assay-

able using transfected RhoB promoter linked to luciferase. RhoB
transcript levels have been observed to be transcriptionally
suppressed by HDAC1 and found to be positively regulated when
treated with an HDAC inhibitor (trapoxin A) via an inverted
CCAAT element in the RhoB promoter 451 bp upstream of the
transcriptional start site (27). RhoB is an early response gene
responding to environmental stresses, such as UV irradiation,
which under these circumstances, is mediated by the RNA-binding
protein HuR stabilizing RhoB mRNA (37). Oppositely, oncogenic
signals mediated by the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway suppress RhoB
expression (38). Thus, although multiple mechanisms seem to
regulate RhoB expression in cancer, the important consequence of
our work is that RhoB can be re-expressed in ATC through the use
of drugs, resulting in biologically active protein that opposes tumor
growth.
We describe a novel mechanistic signaling pathway leading
to tumor growth inhibition by two classes of drugs via a RhoBdependent mechanism that is upstream of p21. We show that

PPARg-mediated up-regulation of p21 mRNA occurs through RhoB
by using dominant negative RhoB and siRNA to silence RhoB. Two
reports have identified a potential link between up-regulation of
p21 and RhoB (28, 29). In one report, RhoB-GG induced p21 in a
p53-dependent manner, although this was dispensable because
RhoB-GG still inhibited the growth of p53-null cells that lacked p21
(28). The authors concluded that RhoB-GG suppressed human
tumor cell proliferation by more than one mechanism and that it
promoted apoptosis as well as inhibited cell cycle transit. In the
other report, ectopic expression of RhoB was shown to up-regulate
p21 (17, 28, 29). Our present study is the first to show that
endogenous RhoB is directly responsible for the regulation of p21
mRNA and protein levels by RS5444 and FK228 in p53-wild-type
(DRO and KTC2) as well as p53-mutant (ARO and KTC3) cells (39).
In a recent report, ciglitazone and rosiglitazone increased
apoptosis in several ATC cell lines (40). The lack of induction of
apoptosis by RS5444 (9) is striking because expression of RhoB
induces apoptosis in cancer cells in cell culture (reviewed in ref. 32)
and ectopic tumors grown in mice (41, 42). Even more surprising,
DAPI staining revealed that treatment with FK228 also does not
induce apoptosis in THJ-11T and THJ-16T, with only slight apoptosis
(f12%) in DRO (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Using a LDH assay to
examine overall cell death, FK228 treatment again only slightly
induces cell death (f13%) in DRO with no effect on KTC2 and
KTC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). One study showed that cyclin
B1 is the target for suppression by RhoB causing apoptosis (43). It is
possible that both RS5444 and FK228 could stimulate an
antiapoptotic pathway antagonizing the proapoptotic properties
of RhoB that is independent of the regulatory role of RhoB in cell
proliferation. Alternatively, it may be that induction of apoptosis by

rosiglitazone might be PPARg/RhoB-independent. One additional
consideration is that cellular localization and posttranslational
modification (prenylation and sumoylation) of RhoB are critical
regulators of its effects (32). Site-directed mutagenesis studies
showed the requirement for palmitoylated cysteine 192 and
prenylated cysteine 193 for the tumor-suppressive and proapoptotic
activities of RhoB (27, 28). Understanding these mechanisms could
be important in the selection of the most potent PPARg agonist or
RhoB modulator for combinatorial therapy such as a thiazolidinedione and taxane against ATC (9). Importantly, we found that
chronic daily treatment of mice harboring ATC tumors with 0.025%
of RS5444 in the diet retains the ability to sustain elevated RhoB
over 4 weeks of treatment (Fig. 2D). This also suggests that RhoB
and p21 may be ideal molecular markers of response to therapy and
easily measured in biopsy tissue following treatment.
In summary, we have identified a novel growth-inhibitory
pathway regulated by PPARg and identified a HDAC inhibitor
that up-regulates RhoB mRNA and protein in human ATC cells
(Fig. 6D). Elevated RhoB protein is necessary for these two drugs to
then up-regulate p21 mRNA and protein as well as inhibit cell
proliferation (Fig. 6D). Thus, RhoB is implicated as a critical
signaling node that could be therapeutically targeted in ATC.
Importantly, it is a target that can be up-regulated by multiple
classes of drugs. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins; ref. 44),
prenylation inhibitors (FTI, GGTI; ref. 32), HDAC inhibitors
(FK228), and now, PPARg agonists, up-regulate RhoB in various
cancers. Although the connection to RhoB has not been made in
ATC, the aforementioned classes of drugs inhibit growth in ATC
cells (45–47), most likely acting in part through up-regulation of
functional RhoB. We are currently investigating the role of these

Figure 5. RhoB up-regulation by RS5444 is required to induce p21.
A, real-time PCR of p21 mRNA in DRO and KTC2 illustrates p21
mRNA’s dependence on RhoB induction when stimulated by RS5444.
Cells were transiently transfected and treated as previously
described. Columns, mean fold change of p21 mRNA expression

B, real-time PCR of p21 mRNA using dominant negative (DN ) RhoB
also showed p21 mRNA’s dependence on RhoB induction through
PPARg. Cells were transiently transfected with either pcDNA3.1 or
dominant negative RhoB and then treated with RS5444 for 24 h.
C, silencing RhoB blocked RS5444-stimulated p21 protein
expression in transiently transfected DRO and KTC2 cells. Protein
lysates were examined for RhoB and p21 expression. RhoA
expression was examined to show the specificity of the RhoB siRNA.

Figure 6. The pan-HDAC inhibitor FK228 mediates RhoB-dependent growth inhibition. A, Western analysis of cells verified that RhoB and p21 expression remained
silenced even in the presence of FK228. Cells were transiently transfected as previously described and then treated with 1 ng/mL of FK228 for 24 h. B, silencing

when compared with scrambled control. *, P < 0.05 when compared with RhoB siRNA control or to scrambled siRNA with FK228. C, Western analysis verified
that THJ-16T do not express PPARg protein. THJ-16T were transiently transfected and treated as described previously. RS5444 was ineffective whereas FK228
up-regulated RhoB and p21 protein levels. Thus, silencing RhoB in THJ-16T cells showed that FK228 is RhoB dependent whereas RS5444 had no effect on
proliferation. Columns, mean plotted as a percentage of scrambled control; bars, SD. *, P < 0.01 when compared with scrambled control. D, the signaling pathway
for both PPARg agonists and HDAC inhibitors in ATC is a linear event whereby they induce RhoB leading to p21 up-regulation leading to attenuation of cell proliferation.
PPARg agonists up-regulate RhoB mRNA and protein via PPARg whereas an HDAC inhibitor most likely up-regulates RhoB mRNA via epigenetic acetylation of
the transcriptional complex regulating RhoB transcription.

drugs that mediate RhoB up-regulation and growth inhibition in
ATC. Posttranslational modification and cellular localization of
RhoB as a result of treatment with each of these drugs will also
most likely dictate optimal antitumor activity (32) and allow for
rational selection of combinatorial therapy with maximum benefit
to the patient.
