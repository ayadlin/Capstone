Treatment of Fludarabine-refractory
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Apostolia-Maria Tsimberidou, MD, PhD1 and Michael J. Keating, MB, BS2

The development of resistance to purine analogs defines a poor-risk subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although in recent years chemoimmunotherapeutic combinations such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab have induced response rates of 95% in previously untreated
patients and increased the rates of failure-free survival, CLL remains incurable for many patients because
of a lack of disease response or the development of refractoriness to fludarabine. Fludarabine-refractory
disease is defined as CLL that does not respond to fludarabine or that recurs within 6 months of treatment
with a fludarabine-containing regimen. The natural course of the disease is associated with poor survival.
Salvage therapeutic strategies include alemtuzumab-containing regimens, targeted agents, and allogeneic
stem cell transplantation. Single-agent alemtuzumab induces response in up to 40% of patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, but responses are not durable, and the median survival is approximately 1 to 2 years.
Alemtuzumab is also combined with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and/or rituximab, and other agents
such as lenalidomide and flavopiridol, as well as targeted agents, and used in fludarabine-refractory CLL.
Cumulative evidence suggests that allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an efficacious therapeutic strategy for patients who do not respond to fludarabine or who develop disease recurrence within 12 months
after purine analog treatment. In conclusion, chemoimmunotherapy regimens that include alemtuzumab
and/or rituximab and allogeneic stem cell transplantation improve the prognosis of this disease, but there

Resistance to purine analogs is a challenging issue in the therapeutic management of patients with
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Treatment of CLL is usually deferred until indications for
therapeutic intervention are present.1 When patients do require treatment, they are typically treated with
purine analogs, most commonly fludarabine. In untreated patients, single-agent fludarabine induced
response in 63% to 80% (complete remission [CR], 20% to 38%) of patients.2,3 The median time to disease progression was reported to be 31 months in 1 study,2 and the progression-free survival was 20
months in the other study.3 With fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination therapy, the response
rates ranged from 74% to 94% (CR, 23% to 35%),4 and the median progression-free survival was 32 to
48 months.5,6 Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) combination therapy induced an
overall response (OR) rate of 95% (CR, 70%), and the 5-year disease-free survival rate was 70%.7,8

Therapy in Fludarabine-refractory CLL/Tsimberidou and Keating

In contrast to the encouraging clinical outcomes of
patients with fludarabine-sensitive CLL, the prognosis of
patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL is poor. Several
factors predict a poor response to purine analogs. Deletion
of the p53 gene is the strongest independent adverse prognostic factor for survival,9 and it is associated with the shortest median treatment-free interval and the shortest survival
compared with other cytogenetic groups in patients with
CLL.10 Other factors predicting poor clinical outcomes
include unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable
region gene (IGHV)11 and expression of ZAP-70.12 Patients
with unmutated IGHV genes have been reported to express
higher proportions of CD38þ B-CLL cells, and patients
with both unmutated IGHV genes and 30% CD38þ
have lower rates of response to chemotherapy (including
fludarabine) and of survival compared with patients with
mutated IGHV genes and <30% CD38þ.13 The adverse
prognostic significance of CD38 reported by other investigators has not been confirmed in our series.14 Other investigators have reported that patients with CLL who were
treated with fludarabine and rituximab with unmutated
IGHV or high-risk interphase cytogenetics (del[17p] or
del[11q]) appeared to have a shorter duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.15 In patients treated
with fludarabine or fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide,
17p or 11q deletion was associated with reduced progression-free survival, but did not appear to affect the response
rates.16 IGHV mutational status, CD38 expression, and
ZAP-70 status did not predict outcome of fludarabine-based
chemotherapy.16 In contrast, in our series 11q deletion was
associated with favorable outcomes in patients treated with
fludarabine and rituximab combination therapies.17
Fludarabine-refractory CLL is defined as CLL with
a response less than a partial remission (PR) to a fludarabine-based regimen or a remission lasting <6 months on
discontinuation of treatment with a fludarabine-based
regimen.18 Most of these patients have already been
exposed to and have disease that is refractory to alkylating
agents. This review focuses on treatments for patients
with fludarabine-refractory CLL.

Clinical Outcomes With
Salvage Chemotherapy
In a retrospective review of 147 patients with fludarabinerefractory CLL, Keating et al. reported a 22% response
Cancer

(CR plus PR) rate to the first salvage regimen and a median survival of 10 months.18 The response rate was highest in the purine analog and alkylating agent combination
therapy group (37%; 16 of 43 patients). The response
rates for alkylating agent-refractory, alkylating agent-naive, and alkylating agent-sensitive CLL were 18%, 22%,
and 40%, respectively; the respective survival rates were 8
months, 10 months, and 14 months.18 As expected,
patients who responded lived longer than nonresponders.
Among patients treated with a second salvage regimen,
the best response rates were noted in patients who underwent stem cell transplantation (6 of 9 patients responded)
and in those who received alemtuzumab (4 of 6 patients
responded).18
In patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, the
response rate to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination therapy was 39% (CR, 3%).4 With fludarabine
and mitoxantrone combination therapy, the response rate
was 25% in patients with fludarabine-refractory disease.19
Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone
induced a response in 78% (CR, 50%) of patients with resistant or recurrent CLL.20
In patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL who
were either refractory to alemtuzumab or ineligible for
alemtuzumab because of bulky lymphadenopathy, the
OR to a variety of first salvage therapies, excluding stem
cell transplantation, was 23% (all PRs), and the median
survival was 9 months.21

Alemtuzumab
Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), an anti-CD52 humanized
monoclonal antibody, has been extensively investigated in
CLL (Table 1). It has significant antileukemic activity,
which is higher in the blood, bone marrow, and spleen
and lower in lymph nodes. The US Food and Drug
Administration has approved alemtuzumab for patients
with B-cell CLL who have been treated with alkylating
agents and for whom fludarabine therapy has failed.
In a pivotal multicenter clinical trial, patients from
21 centers in the US and Europe were treated with alemtuzumab.22 The study objective was to assess the OR rate,
using the 1996 National Cancer Institute working group
(NCI-WG) criteria, in patients with B-cell CLL who had
received an alkylating agent and in whom fludarabine
treatment had failed. Fludarabine failure was defined as

failure to achieve PR or CR to at least 1 fludarabine-containing regimen, disease progression while receiving fludarabine treatment, or disease progression in responders
within 6 months of the last dose of fludarabine.
Alemtuzumab was administered intravenously at
doses that increased gradually; the target dose was 30 mg,
3 times weekly, for a maximum of 12 weeks. Infection
prophylaxis was mandatory, from Day 8 until a minimum
of 2 months after treatment was completed. Responses
were assessed at Weeks 4, 8, and 12, and patients were
observed for 34 months. Ninety-three patients were
treated. The median age of the patients was 66 years
(range, 31-86 years), and the median number of prior
therapies was 7. Twenty-four percent of patients had Rai
stage 0-II, 17% had Rai stage III, and 59% had Rai stage
IV disease. The OR rate in an intent-to-treat analysis was
33% (CR, 2%; PR, 31%) (Table 1). Alemtuzumab
induced response in the blood in 83% and in the bone
marrow in 26% of patients. The median time to response
was 1.5 months (range, 0.4-3.7 months), and the median
time to disease progression for all patients was 4.7
months. Sixty-six patients died, and the median overall
survival duration was 16 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 11.8-21.9). Among responders, the median
time to progression was 9.5 months, and the median survival duration was 32 months. Clinical benefit was
observed both in responders and in patients with stable
disease. The most common adverse events were transient
injection-site reactions, generally grade 1 to 2, which were
usually observed during the 1st week. Grade 3 to 4 infections were reported in 25 patients (27%), but only 3
(10%) of the 31 patients who responded to alemtuzumab
treatment developed grade 3 to 4 infections. This study
demonstrated that alemtuzumab increases the median
survival of patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL compared with historical controls.22
Similar results were reported by Stilgenbauer et al.,
who administered alemtuzumab subcutaneously at 30 mg
three times weekly.23 Overall, 109 patients, who had
received a median of 3 prior therapies, were treated. The
response rate was 33% (CR, 4%), and the median progression-free survival and overall survival durations were
7.7 months and 19.1 months, respectively. Among
patients with del11q and del17p cytogenetic abnormalities, the response rates were 39% and 24%, respectively.
Responses (CR or PR) were observed in 22% of unmuCancer

tated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region
(IgVH), 24% of 11q del, 39% of 17p del, and 33% of
mutated p53 cases. Progression-free survival and overall
survival did not differ significantly among the genetic subgroups, particularly mutated p53, 11q del, and 17p del.
Alemtuzumab was administered on an outpatient basis,
and a temporary interruption was required in 68 patients
because of neutropenia (43%), anemia (6%), thrombocytopenia (3%), or infections (40%; cytomegalovirus
[CMV] reactivations 30%). Treatment was discontinued
early in 63 patients because of insufficient response
(44%), hematotoxicity (16%), infection (17%), or CMV
reactivation (13%). The most common toxicities included
hepatotoxicity, hematologic toxicities (grade 3-4 anemia,
42%; thrombocytopenia, 52%; and neutropenia, 54%),
and infections (grade 3-4). With a median follow-up time
of 21.4 months, the investigators reported 56 deaths
because of disease progression (52%), infections (39%),
or non–CLL-related factors (9%). This study confirmed
that alemtuzumab had activity in patients with high-risk
CLL, including those with unmutated IgVH, 11q del, or
17p del.23
Other phase 2 clinical trials have demonstrated that
alemtuzumab therapy results in favorable clinical outcomes (Table 1).24,25 In a phase 2 clinical trial, patients
previously treated with fludarabine and other chemotherapy regimens received alemtuzumab at 6 centers in the
US.24 Alemtuzumab was administered at a target dose of
30 mg over 2 hours, 3 times weekly, for up to 16 weeks.
Twenty-four patients were treated, and responses were
evaluated by an independent panel of experts using 1996
NCI-WG criteria. In contrast to the aforementioned
study, antimicrobial prophylaxis was not mandatory. The
OR rate was 33% (all PRs), and the median time to
response was 4 months (range, 2-5 months). The median
duration of response was 15 months (range, 5 to 38
months), and the median time to disease progression was
20 months (range, 8 to 42 months). The median survival duration was 36 months (range, 9 to 47 months).
Acute infusion-related events, mainly grade 1 to 2, which
were more common and severe during the first week, were
also noted. Eight nonresponders and 2 responders developed major infections. Pneumocystis carinii (or Pneumocystis jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP) was reported in 2 patients
who had not received PCP prophylaxis. The median
CD4þ and CD8þ counts decreased and started recovering

at the end of the study, with further recovery noted after 1
month of follow-up. This study confirmed the antileukemic activity of alemtuzumab in patients with CLL previously treated with fludarabine and demonstrated that
alemtuzumab protocols should include mandatory prophylaxis because of a lymphopenia-associated high incidence of opportunistic infections.24
Intravenous alemtuzumab also induces response in
patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL bearing del17p
or mutated p53.25-27 CLL with these cytogenetic characteristics is typically resistant to chemotherapy.9 In 1995,
Dohner et al. reported that none of 12 patients with a p53
deletion detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization
responded to fludarabine or pentostatin, compared with
20 (56%) of 36 patients without the deletion (P < .001).
Deletion p53 was also an independent factor predicting
shorter survival in multivariate analysis.9
Some investigators suggest that CLL with p53 mutations or deletions may have higher response rates to alemtuzumab than CLL without these abnormalities.25
Among 36 patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL
treated with alemtuzumab, response rates were higher in
patients with p53 mutations and/or deletions (40%),
compared with others (19%), and the median response
duration for the subset of patients with p53 abnormalities
was 8 months (range, 3-17 months).25

patients were treated and the response rate after the first
course of rituximab was 51% (CR, 4%); after the completion of 1 additional courses (28 patients), the OR rate
was 58% (CR, 9%). However, the progression-free survival duration of 18.6 months was inferior to that
reported with first-line plus maintenance rituximab in
patients with follicular lymphoma.31 Rituximab has been
used in combination with granulocyte-macrophage–colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on the basis of in
vitro33 and clinical data in indolent lymphoma demonstrating increased antitumor activity when combined with
GM-CSF.34 This regimen resulted in a 79% response rate
(CR, 36%) in patients with indolent lymphoma,34 but in
those with CLL who were aged 70 years, response rates
were 61% (CR, 7%).35

Alemtuzumab and Rituximab
Alemtuzumab has been evaluated in combination with rituximab in recurrent/refractory CLL.36,37 At our institution,
concurrent alemtuzumab and rituximab therapy induced
responses in 63% of patients (Table 1). The most common
toxicities were infections and infusion-related reactions.
CMV antigenemia was noted in 27% of the patients, but
only 15% were symptomatic and required therapy.36

Lumiliximab
Rituximab
Rituximab (IDEC-C2B8) is a chimeric antibody that
binds to the B-cell surface antigen CD20. Although
highly effective in follicular lymphoma, with an OR rate
of 60%, single-agent rituximab has inferior clinical activity in B-cell CLL, where it is less effective for clearing disease from the bone marrow and has a short response
duration.28-32 Single-agent rituximab induces responses
in 23% to 45% (CR, 0%-3%) of previously treated CLL
patients (Table 1).28-30,32 A phase 2 study demonstrated a
dose-response relationship, as response rates increased
with increasing rituximab dose.28 Response rates (all PRs)
increased from 22% at a dose of 500 to 825 mg/m2 to
43% at a dose of 1000 to 1500 mg/m2 to 75% at the highest dose of 2250 mg/m2 (P ¼ .007).28 In another study,
rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2
weekly for 4 consecutive weeks as a first-line therapy in
CLL and was repeated at 6-month intervals.31 Overall, 44

Lumiliximab (IDEC-152) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 macaque-human anti-CD23 monoclonal antibody. In a
phase 1 study in patients with CLL, single-agent lumiliximab was administered at doses ranging from 125 mg/m2
weekly to 500 mg/m2 3 times weekly, for 4 weeks.38 Overall, 25 patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL were
treated. Lumiliximab-induced adverse events were headache, constipation, nausea, and cough. A decrease in lymphocyte counts was noted in 91% (42 of 46) of all
patients and in 59% of patients with baseline lymphadenopathy, but no confirmed responses were noted.38 On
the basis of these observations, a phase 1-2 study of lumiliximab and FCR combination therapy was initiated in
recurrent CD23þ B-cell CLL. Lumiliximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 or 500 mg/m2 in combination with FCR every 4 weeks.39 Subsequently, results of
this study led to an ongoing multicenter, global, randomized study of lumiliximab and FCR versus FCR alone.40

Review Article

Ofatumumab
Ofatumumab (HuMax CD20), a monoclonal antibody
that targets a different epitope of CD20 than that targeted
by rituximab, is believed to kill rituximab-resistant cells
(Table 2).41 Results of a phase 1/2 clinical trial of ofatumumab in recurrent/refractory CLL were encouraging.
The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and the
most common toxicities were infusion reactions.41 These
results led to an ongoing international study of ofatumumab for patients with CLL that failed to respond to treatment with fludarabine and alemtuzumab or patients with
disease that failed to respond to fludarabine and who were
unable to tolerate or ineligible to receive alemtuzumab.
High-dose Methylprednisolone
High-dose methylprednisolone-containing therapy also
has activity in fludarabine-refractory CLL, including CLL
with a p53 deletion (5 of 10 patients responded).42 In
combination with rituximab, high-dose methylprednisolone induces high rates of OR and CR (in a study of 14
patients, 93% and 36%, respectively) in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL.43
Lenalidomide
Immunomodulating drugs such as lenalidomide are
believed to exert their antileukemic activity via pleiotropic
immunomodulatory mechanisms. These agents decrease
the production of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-a, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin6.44,45 Lenalidomide also modulates an immune effector
cell response through activation of T cells and natural
killer cells and directly induces apoptosis in tumor cells.
Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrated that lenalidomide is
clinically active in CLL.46,47
Treatment with lenalidomide at a dose of 25 mg
orally on Days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle demonstrated that among 23 patients with fludarabine-refractory
CLL, 7 (30%) patients responded to lenalidomide (CR in
1 patient and PR in 6 patients).46 In our institution, lenalidomide was administered starting at a dose of 10 mg
daily, followed by titration upward in 5-mg increments
every 28 days to a maximum daily dose of 25 mg.47 Three
(7%) patients achieved a CR, 1 a nodular partial remission, and 10 a PR, for an OR rate of 32%. Twelve patients
2830

with fludarabine-refractory CLL were treated, and 3
(25%) patients responded to lenalidomide, compared
with a response rate of 38% in 32 patients with fludarabine-sensitive disease. Treatment with lenalidomide was
associated with an OR rate of 31% in patients with 11q or
17p deletions, 24% in patients with unmutated IgVH,
and 25% in patients with fludarabine-refractory disease.47
Adverse events included fatigue, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and gastrointestinal toxicities.46,47 Lenalidomide in combination with rituximab is currently being
investigated in recurrent or refractory CLL.

Flavopiridol
Flavopiridol (alvocidib) is a broad cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that induces apoptosis in leukemic cell lines
and in human CLL cells in vitro.48 Its activity is p53 independent, and it also decreases the expression of the
proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP, which mediate resistance to
apoptosis in CLL cells. When administered as a continuous infusion, flavopiridol had no activity, but the response
rate was 11% when it was given as a 1-hour bolus in
patients with recurrent CLL.49 When administered in
3 cohorts (cohort 1, 30 mg/m2 loading dose followed by
30 mg/m2 4-hour infusion; cohort 2, 40 mg/m2 loading
dose followed by 40 mg/m2 4-hour infusion; and cohort
3, cohort 1 dose for treatments 1 to 4, and then a 30 mg/
m2 loading dose followed by a 50 mg/m2 4-hour infusion), flavopiridol resulted in a 45% PR rate, with a median survival duration that exceeded 12 months.48 These
responses included 5 (42%) of 12 patients with del 17p
and 13 (72%) of 18 patients with del 11q.48 The doselimiting toxicity was hyperacute tumor lysis syndrome.
Although this study suggests that flavopiridol has activity
in fludarabine-refractory CLL, the investigators suggested
that it be used mainly for the elimination of minimal residual disease after cytoreductive therapy.48

Gossypol
Gossypol (AT-101) is a small molecule that mimics the
inhibitory Bcl-2 homology 3 domain of endogenous
antagonists of the Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic proteins
(Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and Mcl-1).50 Gossypol induces apoptosis and enhances the cytotoxicity of rituximab in CLL
cells. In a phase 2 study, gossypol and rituximab
Cancer

Therapy in Fludarabine-refractory CLL/Tsimberidou and Keating

combination therapy was investigated in recurrent/refractory CLL.51 Gossypol was administered at 30 mg/d for 21
or 28 days for 3 28-day cycles. Rituximab was administered at 375 mg/m2 on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 31, 33,
40, 57, 59, and 61. Preliminary results demonstrated that
gossypol and rituximab induced a PR in 42% (5 of 12) of
patients, with improved lymphocyte counts, splenomegaly, and/or lymph node size. The most frequent toxicities
were gastrointestinal effects, fatigue, and neutropenia.
The study was ongoing at the time of last follow-up, with
different gossypol schedules being tested in an attempt to
improve activity and reduce toxicity.51

Obatoclax
Obatoclax (GX15-070) is a synthetic small molecule that
inhibits the binding of the antiapoptotic properties of
Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and Mcl-1 to the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, and is believed to reinstate programmed cell death in transformed cells. In a phase 1 trial
in CLL, the main adverse events were drowsiness and euphoria.52 Although the clinical activity of this agent was
limited (1 unconfirmed PR and 7 cases of stable disease of
15 patients), improvement in thrombocytopenia was
noted in some patients with baseline cytopenias.52

Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitors
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a ubiquitous molecular
chaperone that is necessary for the expression and activity
of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70,53 which is expressed aberrantly in 45% of patients with B-cell CLL, particularly
those with unmutated B-cell receptor genes, and has been
associated with adverse prognosis.54 In vitro studies demonstrated that the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allyl-amino-demethoxy-geldanamycin induces ZAP-70 degradation and
apoptosis in CLL lymphocytes.53 Another Hsp90 inhibitor, CNF2024 (CF1983 mesylate), is currently being
investigated in patients with recurrent CLL or intolerance
to purine analog–based therapy (Table 2).
Talabostat
Talabostat is an oral small molecule inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidases, such as CD26 and fibroblast activation
protein, which is expressed in bone marrow, lymph nodes,
Cancer

July 1, 2009

and the stroma of solid tumors and induces cytokine and
chemokine expression in lymph nodes and the spleen.55
On the basis of its enhancement of the activity of rituximab in patients with B-cell malignancies, talabostat and
rituximab combination therapy was explored in a phase 2
study in patients with CLL who had failed to respond to
fludarabine and/or rituximab therapy. Rituximab was
administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, 15,
and 22, and talabostat was given at a dose of 300 lg orally
twice daily for 6 days after each rituximab infusion. Toxicities were similar to those associated with rituximab alone,
with the exception of edema, which occurred in 25% of
patients.55 The OR rate was 22% (8 of 36 patients), and
the median response duration was 5 months. However,
these response rates appeared to be lower or equal to those
achieved with single-agent rituximab.

SNS-032
SNS-032, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases
2, 7, and 9, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and
regulate RNA polymerase II–dependent transcription, is
being investigated in an ongoing phase 1 study in patients
with CLL and multiple myeloma.56 Seventeen patients
with CLL have been treated with total doses of 15 to 100
mg/m2. Although no drug-related dose-limiting toxicities
(DLTs) were observed through the 50-mg/m2 dose
cohort, tumor lysis syndrome was noted in all CLL
patients treated at a dose of 75 mg/m2, and 1 patient experienced a DLT of vascular leak syndrome. One patient
treated at a dose of 100 mg/m2 experienced tumor lysis
syndrome and a DLT of transaminitis, but no objective
responses have been observed.56

Chemoimmunotherapy
On the basis of the observation that rituximab enhances
the cytotoxicity of both fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, Keating et al. studied FCR in the treatment of
CLL.7 The OR rate in patients with recurrent or refractory CLL was 73% (CR, 32%).57
The superiority of FCR compared with fludarabine
and cyclophosphamide combination therapy in prolonging progression-free survival was shown in the REACH
(Rituximab in thE study of relApsed Chronic lympHocytic leukemia) trial, a multicenter, randomized, open2831

Review Article

label, international phase 3 study that enrolled 552
patients with recurrent or refractory CD20þ CLL.58 Progression-free survival was defined as the length of time
from the date of treatment randomization to the time of
disease progression, recurrence, or death from any cause;
it was 30.6 months for the FCR arm and 20.6 months in
the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination therapy arm (P ¼ .0002).58
Another regimen with activity against fludarabinerefractory CLL is FCR combined with the monoclonal
antibody alemtuzumab (CFAR) in patients with previously treated CLL.59 CFAR consists of cyclophosphamide
at a dose of 250 mg/m2 on Days 3 to 5; fludarabine at a
dose of 25 mg/m2 on Days 3 to 5; intravenous alemtuzumab at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on Days 1, 3, and 5; and rituximab at a dose of 375 to 500 mg/m2 on Day 2, every 4
weeks. Among 33 patients with fludarabine-refractory
CLL treated with CFAR, the OR rate was 58% (CR, 6%;
nodular PR, 9%; and PR, 42%). However, in logistic
regression multivariate analysis, fludarabine-refractory
disease was an independent factor predicting treatment
failure in this study.59
Another regimen with significant antileukemic activity in recurrent or refractory CLL is oxaliplatin, fludarabine, cytarabine, and rituximab (OFAR) combination
therapy.60,61 The rationale for combining oxaliplatin with
fludarabine and cytarabine was based on preclinical data
demonstrating synergistic cytotoxicity between cisplatin
in combination with the nucleoside analogs cytarabine62
and fludarabine.63-65 Oxaliplatin had shown activity in
recurrent/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma,66-69 and it
had been substituted for cisplatin in the dexamethasone,
high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin regimen70,71 and combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
and prednisone72 for the treatment of large-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma.66,67,69,73 The OFAR regimen consists of increasing doses of oxaliplatin (17.5, 20, or 25 mg/
m2/d) on Days 1 to 4 (phase 1); fludarabine at a dose of
30 mg/m2 on Days 2 to 3; cytarabine at a dose of 1 g/m2
on Days 2 to 3; rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on Day
3; and pegfilgrastim at a dose of 6 mg on Day 6, every 4
weeks. The OR rate in patients with heavily pretreated
fludarabine-refractory CLL was 36%. Responses included
7 of 19 (37%) patients with 17p deletions, 2 of 6 (33%)
patients with 11q deletions, 4 patients with trisomy 12,
and 2 of 5 (40%) patients with 13q deletions.60,61 In our
2832

ongoing phase 1-2 clinical trial of the OFAR regimen in
patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL or Richter syndrome, oxaliplatin is given at a dose of 30 mg/m2 daily on
Days 1 to 4; fludarabine at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on Days 2
to 4; cytarabine at a dose of 500 mg/m2 intravenously on
Days 2 to 4; rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on Day 3;
and pegfilgrastim at a dose of 6 mg on Day 6, every 4
weeks. The current response rate in the phase 2 portion of
the study is 64% (unpublished data).

Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
Cumulative evidence suggests that allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (allo-SCT) is an efficacious therapeutic
strategy for patients with CLL that does not respond to
purine analogs or that recurs within 12 months after treatment. The Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation
recommended that younger patients with CLL whose disease does not respond or recurs within 12 months after
purine analog treatment should be considered for alloSCT.74
Other indications include 1) younger patients with
disease recurrence within 24 months after having achieved
a response to purine analog–based combination therapy
or autologous transplantation and 2) patients with p53
abnormalities requiring treatment. The graft-versus-leukemia effect is evidenced by long-term clinical remissions
in poor-risk patients with CLL who undergo SCT; longterm molecular responses with allogeneic, but not autologous, SCT; lower recurrence rates in the presence of graftversus-host disease; an increased risk of recurrence in
patients who receive T-cell-depleted allografts; and anecdotal cases of donor lymphocyte infusion efficacy.
Six published series of unmanipulated allo-SCT
with reduced-intensity conditioning in CLL included 20
to 73 patients each, with 33% to 90% of patients having
fludarabine-refractory CLL. The studies demonstrated
encouraging results, with recurrence rates ranging from
5% to 28% at 2 years and up to 69% at 4 years.74-79

Other Investigational Agents
Ongoing clinical trials are exploring targeted therapies as
single agents or in combination with chemotherapy and a
monoclonal antibody in fludarabine-refractory CLL.80
Cancer

July 1, 2009

Therapy in Fludarabine-refractory CLL/Tsimberidou and Keating

For example, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib
(BMS-354825)80; a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, ABT-26380;
and a third-generation, glycoengineered type II IgG1
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, GA101,81 are being
investigated in CLL. Other targeted agents, such as phenylethyl isothiocyanate, and nutlins,82 warrant investigation in CLL, given their promising in vitro antileukemic
activity.
Conclusions
In summary, fludarabine-refractory CLL is associated
with a poor prognosis, and its treatment continues to be
challenging. The introduction of salvage therapeutic strategies such as alemtuzumab-containing regimens, chemoimmunotherapeutic regimens, targeted agents, and alloSCT has improved the prognosis of this disease. Novel,
more effective therapies are needed.
