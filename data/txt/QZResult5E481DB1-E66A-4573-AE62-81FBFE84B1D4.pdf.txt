he challenges of late-stage development increasingly are becoming clear as the clinical development of therapeutic cancer vaccines continues to progress. Preclinical and clinical research had
indicated that cancer vaccines exert optimal benefit in earlier stage
disease or in adjuvant/minimal residual disease (MRD) settings.
However, clinical trials in these settings can be prohibitively slow
from a development perspective because of the better prognosis of
the patient population and the current lack of early surrogate
markers of efficacy. Therefore, the ‘optimal’ patient population (the
patient group in which the greatest benefit is demonstrated) for any
given vaccine studied in this setting generally must be identified
first through the conduct of a large randomized trial for each indication, then confirmed in a second large randomized trial. On the
basis of the current regulatory paradigm, a late-stage development

program for a cancer vaccine in the earlier stage disease or adjuvant/MRD setting easily could extend
past 10 years. The tight funding environment and
constant evolution in medical practice, which can
make replication of results from the first trial infeasible over such a long timeline, pose additional challenges. In this report, the authors discuss 3 potential
regulatory solutions to better enable the development and commercialization of therapeutic cancer
vaccines: a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-proposed cost-recovery program, conditional marketing
authorization, and a new development paradigm. All
of these solutions aim to balance a complex equation
of biologic rationale, weight of the evidence for efficacy and safety, regulatory expectations, and cost
and timeline of clinical development.

CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT
Compared with many other disease areas, the prognosis for patients with cancer tends to be poorer,
with fewer available treatment options. Therefore,
the clinical development of a cancer treatment often
is more condensed than the typical Phase 1, 2, and 3
development model for other pharmaceutical products. In oncology, an investigational agent usually is
evaluated in 1 or more phase 1/2 trials to determine
dosing and initial safety and to identify preliminary
signals of efficacy, followed by 1 or more controlled,
randomized phase 2/3 trials to better define efficacy
and safety.
When a late-stage clinical trial fails to meet its
primary endpoint, further analyses (either predefined
or post hoc) may identify evidence of benefit in a
subgroup of patients. According to the conventional
regulatory process, a second late-stage study conducted specifically in this patient subgroup is almost
always necessary to confirm the benefit observed in
the first late-stage trial.
In March 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued its major report on the Critical
Path Initiative, which was designed to modernize the
clinical development process by obtaining fundamentally better answers regarding how the safety
and effectiveness of new products can be demonstrated in faster time frames, with more certainty,
and at lower costs. A key element of the initiative
includes use of an adaptive clinical trial design in
which early evaluation of incoming trial data allows
for refinement in patient selection. For trials in which
an apparent benefit is identified for a subgroup of
patients but not in the overall study population,
adaptive clinical trial design potentially can eliminate
the need for a second trial to confirm subset analysis

findings. However, adaptive trial design is only feasible in cases in which early determinants of efficacy,
such as tumor response or biomarkers, are available.
In patients who have little to no measurable
tumor burden, the use of tumor response as a surrogate measure of potential efficacy is not possible.
The advent of molecular biomarkers of minimal residual disease (MRD) (eg, prostate-specific antigen
in prostate cancer or polymerase chain reactionbased quantification of tumor DNA in serum)
provides a potential index of treatment-associated
change in tumor burden. To our knowledge to
date, however, a correlation of such parameters
with accepted clinical endpoints such as survival
has not been validated. In addition, although there
remains great hope and effort, years of research
have yet to identify quantitative indices of vaccineinduced immune activation that correlate with clinical responses. Accordingly, currently, there appears to
be no near-term solution(s) that would allow key
advantages of adaptive trial design to be realized in
the clinical setting best suited for cancer vaccines.

PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL DATA
Extensive preclinical studies evaluating a variety of
vaccine approaches across more than 15 animal
models of human cancers consistently demonstrate
that therapeutic vaccines benefit the host.1–55 These
approaches include tumor-derived heat shock protein-peptide complexes, tumor cells modified to
secrete cytokines, tumor cells modified to express
the immune costimulatory protein B7, and tumor
cells mixed with bacillus Calmette–Guerin, as well as
a select number of strategies that target defined tumor-associated antigens, such as lymphoma-derived
immunoglobulin (idiotype).56–63
Two key points emerge from these studies. First,
therapeutic vaccination against cancer results in benefit to the host, as measured by complete tumor
rejection, prolonged stabilization of tumor growth,
and/or improved survival time. Second, when it has
been examined, greater efficacy has been observed in
the minimal disease setting compared with the efficacy observed in the setting of more advanced disease.1,20,25,27,29,30,32,34,38,41,48,53,64
In clinical studies, cancer vaccines generally are
safe and well tolerated. Several late-stage, randomized clinical trials of cancer vaccines indicate treatment activity in subsets of patients.65–69 This activity,
as predicted by the preclinical body of evidence,
typically is observed in disease settings in which tumor burden is lower—ie, earlier stage disease or with
adjuvant treatment (eg, in conjunction with surgery,

Cancer Vaccine White Paper/Stebbing et al.

such that there is no evidence of disease or residual
disease is minimal). Summarizing decades’ worth of
clinical trials of cancer vaccines conducted across
multiple tumor types, Choudhury et al. recently concluded that those patients who have limited disease
or patients in the adjuvant settings have benefited
most from this kind of targeted therapy approach.70
Examples are discussed below.

OncoVAX
OncoVAX (Intracel Resources) was evaluated in the
adjuvant setting in a phase 3 clinical trial that
involved patients with stage II or III colon cancer
comparing vaccination versus observation after surgical resection. The study indicated that, with a 5.8year median follow-up, there was a statistically significant benefit associated with vaccine for both recurrence-free survival and overall survival in stage II
patients (n 157), but not in stage III patients (n 84).
For stage II vaccine and control groups, the 5-year
recurrence-free survival rate was 79% versus 62%,
respectively (P .009), and the overall survival rate
was 82.5% versus 72.7%, respectively (P .010).69 A
phase 3 confirmatory trial in stage II colon cancer is
planned that will enroll an estimated 600 patients and
will take at least 5 years to complete.
Sipuleucel-T
An exploratory subset analysis of a phase 3 trial evaluating the Sipuleucel-T (APC8015; Dendreon) cancer
vaccine that involves 127 patients with asymptomatic, androgen-independent, metastatic prostate cancer indicated that a subset of patients with Gleason
scores 7 (n 75) appeared to derive the most benefit
from vaccine therapy. In this better prognosis subset,
the median time to disease progression was 16 weeks
for patients who received vaccine versus 9 weeks for
patients who received placebo (P .002; hazards ratio
[HR], 2.2).71 Final 3-year follow-up data demonstrated a median survival benefit of 21%, or 4.5
months, and a 3-fold improvement in survival at 36
months compared with placebo, regardless of Gleason score (P .010; HR, 1.7).65 A biologics licensing
application for Sipuleucel-T has been reviewed, and
the FDA will consider this further with updated overall survival data.
Vitespen
Subset analysis from a phase 3 trial of the Vitespen
cancer vaccine (Antigenics) also indicated a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival among
a group of patients with a better prognosis. The trial,
which involved 728 patients who had nonmetastatic

957

renal cell carcinoma (RCC), compared nephrectomy
versus nephrectomy plus Vitespen. In the per-protocol population of 604 patients (nonmetastatic RCC
without residual disease at baseline after surgery),
there was a 43% improvement in recurrence-free survival associated with vaccine compared with observation among a subgroup of 361 patients with earlier
stage disease: stage I, high-grade; stage II, highgrade; or stage III (T1, T2 and T3a), low grade
(P .018 [nominal, 2-sided]; HR, 0.567).72 This group
of patients with a better prognosis correlates with
‘‘intermediate risk’’ patients, a definition currently
being used by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group in a large, ongoing RCC adjuvant study.73 Data
from that trial continue to be collected and analyzed
to gain additional efficacy information.

aTL
Although the majority of clinical research indicates
greater benefit of cancer vaccines among patients
with earlier stage disease, a subset analysis of a
phase 3 trial of the aTL cancer vaccine (LipoNova) in
patients with nonmetastatic RCC indicated a significant reduction in tumor progression for patients with
T3 tumors but not for patients with T2 tumors.74 The
5-year progression-free survival rate was 81.3% for
patients with T2 tumors who received vaccine
(n 119) versus 74.6% for similar patients in the control arm (n 145; P .216). For patients with T3
tumors, the 5-year progression-free survival rate was
67.5% for those in the vaccine arm (n 58) compared
with 49.7% for those in the control arm (n 57;
P .039). The apparent lesser degree of vaccine benefit
among patients with T2 tumors most likely was
influenced by the 5-year timeframe of observation,
which may not have been long enough to capture
the vaccine’s effect among this group of patients with
earlier stage disease. An updated report with additional overall survival data is expected, and a second
phase 3 study is planned.

REGULATORY CHALLENGES OF CANCER
VACCINE DEVELOPMENT
Compared with traditional cancer drugs, therapeutic
cancer vaccines are biologic agents designed to activate the immune system to target tumor cells with
high specificity, and they generally are regarded as
safe and well tolerated. However, an important barrier that limits vaccine efficacy in the setting of
established cancer (as opposed to prophylactic vaccination) is the development of immune tolerance to
cancer antigens that arises during tumor progression.75 This contributes to the well documented ob-

958

CANCER

servation that therapeutic cancer vaccines are far
more efficacious in settings of lower tumor burden,
such as early-stage or adjuvant/MRD settings, findings that are supported by a large body of preclinical
and clinical data.
Traditional cancer agents typically are evaluated
in settings of high tumor burden, allowing for
quicker data collection and the use of surrogate endpoints, such as tumor response. In contrast, evaluating therapeutic cancer vaccines in ‘better prognosis’
patients with lower tumor burden is challenging
because of the long timelines required to measure
effects on endpoints that are meaningful in this disease setting (eg, overall and recurrence-free survival).
Identification of the ‘optimal’ patient population
for treatment also is difficult in lower tumor burden
settings and entails large randomized trials for each
vaccine in any given indication. Although preclinical
studies indicate that a vaccine has greatest benefit in
early disease, the vaccine’s effect still must be evaluated in humans across a range of early disease stages
to identify exactly which stages or subcategories of
disease are most responsive to the treatment in each
indication and for each vaccine being tested. In addition, any compelling benefit observed in a subgroup
of patients—even if it is statistically significant in
predefined or post hoc analyses—must be confirmed
subsequently in a second randomized trial involving
this subgroup.

PROPOSED REGULATORY SOLUTIONS
To facilitate the clinical development of cancer vaccines in the disease setting in which they are likely
to have the most benefit—the ‘better prognosis’
patient setting (earlier stage of disease or adjuvant/
MRD)—3 solutions are summarized here for consideration separately or in tandem: an FDA-proposed
cost-recovery program, conditional marketing authorization, and a new development paradigm.

Cost recovery
In December 2006, the FDA issued a draft of a proposed rule to amend the regulation concerning charging patients for investigational new drugs. If the
proposed rule becomes effective as it is written currently, then it will permit charging for a broader
range of investigational uses than presently allowed,
which provides a potential mechanism to partially
fund the long and expensive, late-stage trials of cancer vaccines. The proposed rule strictly defines criteria that must be met to qualify for cost recovery and
further stipulates that the price charged for the drug
under this allowance generally would be only for the

direct costs of manufacture and supply of the product. However, given the extraordinary expense of
large and long trials currently needed to demonstrate
efficacy in patients with earlier stage disease, the
applicability of cost recovery in this clinical setting is
questionable. In addition, the success of such an initiative depends on working with the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services and private payers
to ensure adequate patient reimbursement.

Conditional marketing authorization
Another model that has been proposed for consideration is similar to that recently adopted in Europe
and grants conditional marketing authorizations
(CMAs) before full marketing approval for treatments
that provide preliminary scientific evidence to
demonstrate a positive risk-benefit assessment. In
life-threatening or orphan disease settings, CMAs
allow patient access to treatments while confirmatory
data are gathered in a postmarketing environment.
Approval under this scenario requires that the sponsor complete or initiate the studies to provide the
necessary additional data, and authorization is subject to annual renewal or revocation.
Under the conditions of a CMA, it is important
for regulatory authorities to consider the types of
trials that can be executed ethically and reasonably
to provide the confirmatory evidence needed. CMAs
provide an opportunity for greater access to investigational treatments and more comprehensive cost
recovery compared with the FDA cost-recovery
program. Given the significant costs associated with
caring and treating cancer patients who have
advanced disease, prevention of recurrence through
the use of cancer vaccines could translate into significant patient benefit as well as significant cost savings to the health care system. However, as with all
adjuvant studies, benefit will need to be balanced
with the finding that a proportion of patients with
earlier stage disease never will have a recurrence after initial intervention and ultimately may receive
unnecessary treatment.
New development paradigm
A new development paradigm for cancer vaccines
recently was proposed by the Cancer Vaccine Clinical
Trial Working Group (CVCTWG), a group of 50
experts from academia, regulatory bodies, and the
biotech/pharmaceutical industry from America and
Europe that was organized by the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer and the Cancer
Vaccine Consortium.76 The authors proposed a clinical development model in which therapeutic cancer

Cancer Vaccine White Paper/Stebbing et al.

vaccines are investigated in 2 general types of clinical
studies: proof-of-principle trials and efficacy trials.
Designed to account for biologic features of cancer
vaccines, the CVCTWG’s proposed paradigm supports a more flexible, prompt, and focused process
of clinical development with early and informed decision making through prospectively defined decision
points (ie, ‘go’ or ‘no go’), the use of biologic endpoints and adjusted clinical endpoints, and the early
use of randomized trials and adaptive design components when applicable.
The CVCTWG must be commended for their
contributions toward developing a more feasible regulatory pathway for therapeutic cancer vaccines,
which represents an important step in highlighting
the need for regulatory accommodation to enable
accelerated and efficient development of cancer vaccines. However, it remains unclear how the proposed
development paradigm could be applied effectively
in the near term toward the acceleration of cancer
vaccine development in the better prognosis patient
setting. The lack of currently established, early markers of efficacy and the issue of ‘late events’ (the long
timeline required for a meaningful proportion of
patients to experience disease recurrence) remain
impediments to the accelerated decision making inherent in the CVCTWG’s model.
Because therapeutic cancer vaccines appear to
be associated with far fewer toxicities and greater
specificity of action compared with traditional cancer
treatments, this newer category of treatments is a
strong candidate for applying a novel development
and regulatory path. Discussions at a recent cancer
vaccine development and licensure workshop, which
was sponsored jointly by the National Cancer Institute and FDA, indicated that there exists broad consensus, based on decades’ worth of preclinical and
clinical data, that the best biologic setting for a therapeutic cancer vaccines is in patients with earlier
disease, which makes findings from clinical trials in
these patients especially compelling. Given the current lack of novel approaches to accelerating phase 3
clinical trials in this disease setting, consideration
should be given to the type and amount of clinical
efficacy data needed to support regulatory approval
for cancer vaccines, especially given the strong indications of favorable safety and high specificity as
well as the apparent biologic rationale for the application of therapeutic cancer vaccines in the setting
of patients with earlier stage disease.
Changes in regulatory convention are needed to
ensure the continued advancement of this promising
field. Innovation and dialogue in the regulatory process for cancer vaccine development will be critical

959

for the sustained investment of time, effort, and
funds—without which progress in this novel and important area may never come close to realizing its
potential.
