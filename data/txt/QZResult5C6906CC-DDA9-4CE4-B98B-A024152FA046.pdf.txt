Abstract
We have previously shown that evolutionarily conserved
alteration/deficiency in activation (Ada) protein associates
with and promotes estrogen receptor (ER)–mediated target
gene expression. Here, we examined the role of endogenous
Ada3 to recruit histone acetyl transferases (HAT) to an ERresponsive promoter and its role in estrogen-dependent cell
proliferation and malignant phenotype. Using a combination
of glycerol gradient cosedimentation and immunoprecipitation analyses, we show that Ada3, ER, and three distinct HATs
[p300, (p300/CBP-associated factor) PCAF, and general control nonrepressed 5 (Gcn5)] are present in a complex. Using
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that short
hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated knockdown of Ada3 in
ER-positive breast cancer cells significantly reduced the
ligand-dependent recruitment of p300, PCAF, and Gcn5 to
the ER-responsive pS2 promoter. Finally, we use shRNA
knockdown to show that Ada3 is critical for estrogendependent proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines
in two-dimensional, as well as three-dimensional, culture.
Knockdown of Ada3 in ER-positive MCF-7 cells induced
reversion of the transformed phenotype in three-dimensional
culture. Thus, our results show an important role of Ada3
in HAT recruitment to estrogen-responsive target gene
promoters and for estrogen-dependent proliferation of breast
cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11789–97]

Introduction
Estrogens play pivotal functional roles in the development,
differentiation, and oncogenesis in female reproductive organs,
such as the mammary gland and uterus (1, 2). The effects of
estrogens are mediated through estrogen receptor a (ERa) and
ERh, members of the nuclear hormone receptor (NR) family. These
receptors serve as sequence-specific transcriptional regulators by
binding to specific estrogen-responsive elements (ERE) within
target gene promoters (3, 4). In the absence of bound ligands,
NRs repress target gene transcription by associating with histone
deacetylase–containing corepressor complexes. Ligand binding
triggers the release of corepressors and subsequent association

with coactivator complexes that are needed for crucial steps in
gene transcription, including chromatin modification, remodeling,
and recruitment of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (reviewed in
refs. 4–6).
Two groups of NR coactivators have been widely studied: (a) the
p300 and the highly related cAMP-responsive element binding
protein–binding protein (CBP) and (b) the mammalian Mediator
complexes (TRAP, DRIP, ARC, CRSP, SMCC, etc.; refs. 4–6). The p300
and CBP proteins are recruited to ligand-activated, DNA-bound
NRs by the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family (SRC-1, SRC-2,
and SRC-3) of bridging factors (4–6). The SRC proteins have
receptor interaction domains containing LXXLL motifs that
contact the ligand-binding domains (7, 8). The p300 and CBP
proteins are histone acetyltransferases (HAT) that mediate the
acetylation of nucleosomal histones, a covalent modification
generally associated with the enhancement of transcription.
Furthermore, the HAT-dependent acetylation of transcriptional
activators themselves promotes their activity (9).
Recent studies have identified an evolutionarily conserved
coactivator complex as a potential regulator of ER and other
NRs. Initially identified through genetic studies in yeast, the core
components of the alteration/deficiency in activation (Ada)
complex include the adapter proteins Ada3 and Ada2 and general
control nonrepressed 5 (Gcn5), a HAT (10). Mammalian Ada3
exists as a component of a yeast Ada-like complex that includes
Ada2 and Gcn5, indicating evolutionary conservation of its
function (11). Initial studies of mammalian retinoid X receptor
(RXR) and GR expressed in the yeast indicated a requirement
of yeast Ada complex, including the yAda3 gene product, for
transcriptional activation (12). We and others have shown in
mammalian cell systems that Ada3 indeed interacts with NRs,
including RXR and ER (13, 14), as well as some non-NR
transcriptional factors, such as p53 (15–17). Notably, overexpression of Ada3 enhanced ER-mediated target gene expression,
whereas down-regulation of its expression had an opposite effect
(14). These studies have raised the possibility that Ada3, as a
component of ER coactivator complexes, may control ER-mediated
biological outputs in mammalian cells. However, whether Ada3 at
physiologically expressed levels indeed functions in this capacity is
not known. This issue is particularly important because other
multiple adaptor proteins, such as SRCs (see above), have been
previously shown to control ER function in mammalian cells
(1–6, 18). Furthermore, mammalian cells express Gcn5, as well as
closely related HAT, called p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF;
ref. 19); the known interaction of PCAF with p300 might suggest
that Ada3 may not play an important role in ER function.
Alternatively, the ability of PCAF and apparently Gcn5 to interact
with Ada3, as well as p300, might suggest that these proteins may
function in concert and that Ada3 may play a crucial role in their

recruitment to ligand-bound ER on target gene promoters and
subsequent functional responses.
In this study, we show that endogenously expressed Ada3 is
present in a complex that includes ER and multiple HATs (p300,
Gcn5, and PCAF) and that Ada3 is required for the recruitment
of these HATs to an ER target gene promoter in the context of
intact chromatin. We also show Ada3 is required for ER-mediated
proliferation of breast cancer cells in two-dimensional, as well as
three-dimensional, cultures, with a reversal of the transformed
phenotype in three-dimensional cultures of MCF-7 cells upon Ada3
knockdown. These studies underscore a crucial role of Ada3 in
orchestrating ER-mediated gene transcription, as well as downstream biological outputs in the context of breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells and media. The ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7
and ZR-75-1 were grown in a-MEM medium (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For some experiments,
the ER-positive cell lines were cultured for 72 h in a phenol red–free
a-medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS
(Hyclone) to remove residual 17h-estradiol (E2).
Antibodies. Generation of anti-hAda3 rabbit polyclonal antiserum has
been described previously (15). Antibodies against p53 (DO1), ERa, p300,
PCAF, Gcn5, and h-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc. Anti–Flag–horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies were from Sigma.
h-Actin antibodies were from Abcam, Inc.
Generation of stable Ada3 short hairpin RNA knockdown cells. The
hAda3-specific RNA interference sequences used in short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) constructs are GCAATCAGAACAAGCCCTT (#1) and GGTGACAGACGATTCCTGA (#2). The oligonucleotides were cloned in the pSUPERRetro vector (OligoEngine). MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells were infected with
hAda3 RNA interference retroviral supernatants as described previously
(14, 17). Virally transduced cells were selected and maintained in 0.5 Ag/mL
puromycin for 72 h, and expression of endogenous hAda3 was assessed
in the whole-cell lysate using anti-hAda3 polyclonal antibody followed by
Western blotting.
Cell proliferation assay. Cells (2  104) from MCF-7 or ZR-75-1, stably
expressing scrambled shRNA or two independent shRNA against hAda3,
were plated in six-well plates for growth analyses. Cells were seeded in
regular a-MEM medium supplemented with 0.5 Ag/mL of puromycin. After
24 h, medium was replaced with phenol red–free a-medium (plus 0.5 Ag/mL
puromycin) to remove residual E2 and, after that, treated with either vehicle
or 100 pmol/L E2. The cells were trypsinized and counted at the indicated
time points.
Three-dimensional culture on Matrigel. For the three-dimensional
tissue culture system, the procedure was essentially as described previously
(20, 21) with some modifications. Briefly, single-cell suspensions were
prepared by trypsinization and 2.5  103 cells in 0.4 mL of 2% Matrigel
(phenol red–free Matrigel from BD Biosciences) in phenol red–free amedium. For stable cells containing shRNAs, medium was supplemented
all the time with 0.5 Ag/mL puromycin. Cells were plated in eight-well
chamber slides (BD Biosciences) on top of a 40-AL polymerized layer
of 100% Matrigel. The cultures were fed every 3 days. For some samples
after E2 deprivation, 100 pmol/L E2 was included in the feeding medium
through the end of experiment. Phase contrast images were documented
periodically during the entire growth period.
Separation of native hAda3-associated complexes. MCF-7 cells were
cultured for 72 h in phenol red–free a-medium (Hyclone) to remove all
residual E2 and, after that, treated for 24 h with either vehicle or 100 pmol/L
E2. Whole-cell extracts (f4 mg of protein) were dialyzed 3 h at 4jC against
buffer containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The dialyzed
material was centrifuged to remove all insoluble material and then layered
onto 9 mL of a 10% to 30% linear glycerol gradient and centrifuged for
18 h at 41,000 rpm at 4jC using a TH641 rotor (Sorvall). Gradients were

fractionated by collecting 360 AL aliquots. Fractions were trichloroacetic
acid precipitated and then analyzed by Western blotting using specific
antibodies, as indicated in the figure. Additionally, high molecular weight
markers (HMW; Sigma) were centrifuged on the separate gradients, and one
of five from every fraction was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. This allowed the calculation of the apparent
molecular weights corresponding to particular fractions of the gradient.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described previously (22). In
brief, MCF-7 cells were cultured in phenol red–free medium (Hyclone) for
3 days followed by either mock treatment or 10 nmol/L E2 for 30 min. After
that, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link the DNA-protein
complexes. The cross-linking was quenched by adding glycine solution.
Cells were washed with cold PBS. A small portion of the cross-linked,
sheared chromatin solution was saved as input DNA (5%), and the
remainder was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-ERa antibody
(Ab-10, Neo Marker), anti-p300 (RW128, Upstate), anti-RNA polymerase II
(8WG16, Abcam), anti-PCAF (E-8, Santa Cruz), anti-Gcn5 (H-75, Santa
Cruz), and hAda3 (15). Immunoprecipitated DNA was deproteinized by
phenol-chloroform extraction, precipitated by ethanol, and resuspended in
TE buffer. PCR amplifications were performed with primers covering pS2
promoter (region from 353 to 30): forward primer 5¶-GGCCATCTCTCACTATGAATCACTTCTGC-3¶ and reverse primer 5¶-GGCAGGCTCTGTTTGCTTAAAGAGCG-3¶. Control PCR was performed using primers covering
the region upstream to pS2 promoter (region from 679 to 501): forward primer 5¶-GTGATTCTCCTGACTTAACC-3¶ and reverse primer 5¶-TGGCGCAGTGGCTCACGCTG-3¶. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) primers were used as control (14).
Immunoblots and immunoprecipitation. For immunoblots, 80 Ag of
cell lysate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane, and probed with antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were used for signal detection. For immunoprecipitation experiments, MCF-7 cells were maintained in a phenol red–free
a-medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS (Hyclone)
for 72 h and then treated with either 100 pmol/L E2 or vehicle for 24 h.

Results
Ada3 cosediments with multiple HATs upon E2 treatment of
breast cancer cell lines. Whereas yeast Ada3 functions as a component of the ADA complex with Gcn5 as the HAT (23), mammalian
Ada3 was found to associate with p300 (16, 17) and was present in
the same complex as PCAF in a cervical cancer cell line (24). Thus,
Ada3 may form multiple independent coactivator complexes with
various HATs or a larger complex containing multiple HATs. We used
cosedimentation analysis on glycerol gradients to isolate intact
Ada3-containing complexes from untreated and E2-treated breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 to address this issue. Cells were lysed under
mild conditions (50 mmol/L NaCl) to ensure that even potentially
weak protein-protein interactions remained intact. Equal amounts
of protein extracts were subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation
and Ada3-containing complexes were identified by Western
immunoblotting of individual fractions. Internal standards were
used to determine the relative molecular sizes of isolated complexes.
In estrogen-deprived MCF-7 cells, the majority of Ada3 was
found in fractions 11 to 14 (Fig. 1A–D). Upon E2 treatment, the
Ada3 protein showed a shift toward higher molecular weight
fractions ( fractions 13–16), suggestive of association with additional proteins. As expected, a proportion of the ER protein, as well
the Ada3-binding partner p53, was also present in the same
fractions as Ada3 (Fig. 1A–D), confirming our previous studies
(15, 17). Whereas p53 remained relatively unchanged in its location
in the gradients, the ER peak shifted into higher molecular weight
fractions ( fractions 11–14 versus fractions 13–18).

Ada3 Requirement for ER-Dependent Cell Proliferation

We also immunoblotted the fractionated proteins to determine
the location of potential HAT partners of Ada3: p300, Gcn5, and
PCAF. Each of these HATs showed partial cosedimentation with
Ada3, which, with PCAF and Gcn5, was relatively modest before E2
treatment (Fig. 1A); however, the cosedimentation was more clearly
observed upon E2 treatment (Fig. 1B), consistent with their
incorporation into an Ada3-containing complex. The peak p300

fractions did not show a significant shift upon E2 treatment;
however, we have frequently noticed increased intensity of p300
bands in E2 versus untreated cell fractions (Fig. 1). Cosedimentation of the three HAT proteins (p300, Gcn5, and PCAF), as well as
the ER, with Ada3 and their shift into overlapping fraction upon
E2 treatment supports the idea that Ada3 is present in a complex
with these proteins.

MCF-7, either vehicle-treated (A) or treated
with 100 pmol/L of E2 for 24 h (B; f4 mg

were dialyzed 3 h at 4jC against buffer X
[50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L PMSF]
and then layered on top of 9 mL of a 10%
to 30% linear glycerol gradient and
centrifuged O/N at 41,000 rpm at 4jC,
using a TH641 rotor (Sorvall). Gradients
were fractionated by collecting 360 AL
aliquots from the top of the gradients.
Fractions were TCA precipitated and then
analyzed by Western blotting using specific
antibodies, as indicated in the figure. One
fifth from every fraction of the separated
HMW markers was separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomasie

allowed the calculation of the apparent
molecular weight corresponding to
particular fractions of the gradient.

the bands (Y axis) versus fraction number
(X axis). The experiments were repeated
at least thrice.

Ada3 associates with PCAF, Gcn5, and p300 in breast cancer
cell lines. To further substantiate the association of Ada3 with
various HATs, we performed coimmunoprecipitation analyses
using lysates of untreated or E2-treated MCF-7 cells expressing a
Flag-Ada3. Ectopically expressed Flag-Ada3 was used for these
analyses to overcome the uncertainty about the efficiency of
immunoprecipitation because of the comigration of endogenous
Ada3 with the heavy chain of immunoprecipitation antibody
(data not shown). Anti-Flag immunoprecipitation followed by anti–
Flag-HRP immunoblotting showed efficient immunoprecipitation
of Ada3 protein (Fig. 2). As expected, anti-ER immunoblotting
showed a clear association between Ada3 and ER (Fig. 2). Notably,
all three HATs, p300, PCAF, and Gcn5, were also coimmunoprecipitated with the Ada3 protein. These results complement the
cosedimentation analyses, indicating that Ada3 associates with all
three HATs in addition to the ER.
Ligand-dependent recruitment of Ada3 and HATs to an ER
target gene promoter. Given the critical role of coactivator
recruitment to transcriptional activators bound to target gene
promoters (25) and our previous findings that Ada3 is recruited
to native estrogen-responsive promoter pS2 (14), we performed
ChIP analysis of untreated and E2-treated MCF-7 cell chromatin
extracts to assess the corecruitment of Ada3 and HATs on pS2
promoter. As expected, both ER and Ada3 were found to be
bound to pS2 promoter, and treatment with E2 led to a
significant increase in the pS2 promoter occupancy by both
ERa and Ada3 (Fig. 3). Parallel ChIP analysis of HATs showed that
p300, Gcn5, and PCAF are recruited to the pS2 promoter upon E2
treatment (Fig. 3); concurrently, we also observed that RNA
polymerase II was present in ChIPs, as anticipated (26). No
significant signals were detected from either the preimmune
serum or mouse or rabbit IgG (Fig. 3). Control PCR analysis of a
region upstream of the ERE element in the pS2 promoter and
GAPDH promoter also showed no detectable signals (Fig. 3).
These results clearly indicated that all three HATs examined are

Figure 2. Ada3 interacts with PCAF, Gcn5, and p300 in breast cancer cells.
MCF-7 cells stably expressing Flag-Ada3 were starved for 72 h, either
vehicle-treated or treated with 100 pmol/L of E2 for 24 h, and then lysed. Lysates
(3 mg) were incubated with either anti-flag or nonspecific antibodies for 2 h at
4jC. After adding protein G–Sepharose beads at 4jC for 1 h, the bound proteins
were subjected to Western blotting analysis with anti–Flag-HRP to detect
hAda3 or other indicated antibodies to detect various proteins.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

recruited to the pS2 promoter in addition to Ada3 and ER and
raised the possibility that Ada3 may play a role in the recruitment
process (addressed below).
Ada3 is required for optimal association of HATs and ERA
to the pS2 promoter in a native chromatin context. As Ada3
serves as an adapter within the ADA complexes, we surmised that
it might play a role in Gcn5 recruitment to ER target promoters;
as the mechanisms of PCAF and p300 recruitment to ER target
promoter remain to be determined, we also asked if Ada3 plays
any role in their recruitment. For this purpose, we generated
MCF-7 cells stably expressing either a scrambled shRNA or two
independent shRNAs against Ada3. Anti-Ada3 immunoblotting of
cell lysates showed the specific knockdown of Ada3 in Ada3
shRNA but not in control shRNA-expressing cells (Fig. 4). Extracts
of untreated or E2-treated cells were then subjected to ChIP
analyses to assess recruitment of various proteins to pS2
promoter. MCF-7 cells expressing the scrambled shRNA control
showed the anticipated ligand-promoted recruitment of Ada3,
ERa, p300, PCAF, Gcn5, and RNA polymerase II to the pS2
promoter with no signals in negative control lanes (preimmune
serum, mouse or rabbit IgG, or PCR of upstream region in pS2
promoter or GAPDH promoter; Fig. 5). Notably, ChIPs of cells
expressing shRNAs against hAda3 showed a substantial decrease
in the recruitment of ER and all three HATs to the pS2 promoter
compared with cells expressing the control shRNA (Fig. 5). These
results suggest that endogenous Ada3 plays an essential role in
the recruitment of all three HATs examined to an ER target
promoter. Interestingly, Ada3 knockdown also resulted in reduced
ChIP with anti-ER antibodies, indicating that Ada3 also contributes to the stability of ER association with a target promoter in
native chromatin context.
Ada3 is required for ER-dependent cell proliferation. In
view of the critical role of endogenous Ada3 in the recruitment of
HATs (and apparently to the stability of ER occupancy) to an ER
target promoter, as revealed by ChIP analyses of Ada3
knockdown cells, we hypothesized that Ada3 will be required
for downstream functional consequences of ER-dependent
transcriptional activation. Therefore, we compared the level of
E2-induced cell proliferation in control versus Ada3 shRNAexpressing MCF-7 cells, as well as a similar pair of another ERpositive breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-1. Western blot analysis of
cell lysates showed the specific knockdown of Ada3 protein in
Ada3 shRNA-expressing cells compared with scrambled shRNAexpressing cells, with more substantial knockdown with Ada3
shRNA #2 versus #1 (Fig. 4). Assessment of cell proliferation in
response to E2 over time showed the expected E2-induced
proliferation of control shRNA-expressing MCF-7 and ZR-75-1
cells scrambled shRNA, whereas no significant proliferation was
observed in the absence of E2 (Fig. 4). In contrast, cells with
Ada3 knockdown showed a substantial reduction in E2-induced
cell proliferation at all times; the inhibition was more marked
(f50% reduction at day 7) in cells expressing shRNA #2, in
which a higher degree of knockdown was observed compared
with those expressing shRNA #1 (f25% reduction at day 7;
Fig. 4). These results underscore the important role of Ada3 in
estrogen-dependent cell proliferation.
Essential role of Ada3 in estrogen-dependent malignant
phenotype of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional Matrigel
culture. Compared with the conventional two-dimensional tissue
culture system, the Matrigel-supported three-dimensional culture
system allows analysis of normal and cancerous breast epithelial

Ada3 Requirement for ER-Dependent Cell Proliferation

Figure 3. Ada3 is recruited to the endogenous
estrogen promoter along with HATs in a
ligand-dependent manner. Soluble chromatin
was prepared from MCF-7 cells, either
vehicle-treated or treated with 10 nmol/L E2 for
30 min, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies
against ERa, Ada3, p300, Gcn5, PCAF, or RNA
polymerase II. The final DNA extractions were
amplified using pairs of primers that cover the
region of pS2 promoter. PCR amplification of

promoter was used as specificity control.

cell proliferation that more closely mimics that observed in vivo
(27). We therefore assessed the role of endogenous Ada3 in the
E2-dependent proliferation of MCF-7 cells in three-dimensional
culture. For this purpose, MCF-7 cells expressing scrambled or
Ada3 shRNA were cultured for 4 days in phenol red–free Matrigel,
using previously established methods (28), followed by feeding with
medium containing E2 (100 pmol/L) for a period of 2 weeks. In
the absence of exogenous E2, neither the control nor the Ada3
knockdown cells displayed any proliferation (data not shown).
However, when E2 was included in the growth medium, the control
shRNA-expressing cells formed large irregular colonies typical of
breast cancer cell growth on Matrigel (Fig. 6A; refs. 20, 21, 27).
In contrast, MCF-7 cell lines expressing two independent shRNAs
developed markedly smaller structures (Fig. 6A). The extent of
reduction in colony size was quantified by enumerating small
(0.004–0.01 cm2), medium (0.01–0.3 cm2), or large (0.3 cm2 or more)
colonies. Whereas parental and control shRNA-expressing MCF-7
cells form predominantly large and medium-sized colonies, those
with Ada3 shRNA form primarily small colonies (Fig. 6B). Notably,
the colonies formed by Ada3 knockdown MCF-7 cells were more
regular and acinus-like, similar to those reported by the Bissell
laboratory for other treatments that induce a reversal of the
malignant phenotype of breast cancer cells on Matrigel (Fig. 6A;

ref. 29). These results provide evidence that Ada3 protein is
required for E2-dependent proliferation under three-dimensional
growth conditions that closely mimic in vivo cell proliferation.

Discussion
Estrogens play crucial roles in the development and function of
various female reproductive tissues and are critically important in
human cancer (1, 2). For example, nearly 70% to 80% breast cancers
are ER-positive and antiestrogens, and aromatase inhibitors are
now used as a first line of treatment for such patients (1, 2, 30).
Similar to NRs in general, the ability of estrogens to serve as
activating switches to turn on ER-responsive genes and the ensuing
control of cellular functions requires coregulatory proteins;
corepressors keep ER targets repressed, whereas coactivators
promote target gene expression (5–8). The latter is mediated
through the recruitment of HATs, which allow chromatin
remodeling required for optimal transcriptional activation (5–8, 25).
Thus far, the best characterized ER coactivators are members of
the SRC family, which have been linked to the recruitment of
HAT proteins p300 and PCAF (5–8, 31–34). We have previously
identified Ada3, an evolutionarily conserved component of ADA3
coactivator complex, as a coactivator of ER-mediated target gene

expression (14). Here, we show that Ada3 associates with multiple
HATs (p300, PCAF, and GCN5) and that endogenous Ada3 in
human ER-positive breast cancer cell lines is essential for the
recruitment to ER target gene promoters, suggesting its role as a
key organizer of HAT recruitment and ER-dependent transcription.
We further show that Ada3 is essential for ER-dependent functional
responses, as shown by a marked inhibition of estrogen-dependent
proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines with Ada3
knockdown and reversal of the malignant behavior of such cells

when grown in three-dimensional culture on Matrigel. Thus, our
results suggest a critical role of Ada3 as a regulator of ER function
in the context of human ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation
and malignant phenotype.
It is noteworthy that estrogen-regulated gene transcription,
proliferation, and oncogenesis in mammary cell systems require
members of the SRC family (31–34). For example, estrogendependent proliferation of MCF-7 cells was reduced upon SRC-3
depletion (35). Similarly, depletion of SRC-1 or SRC-2 inhibit the

Ada3 Requirement for ER-Dependent Cell Proliferation

Figure 6. Ada3 regulates estrogen-dependent proliferation
of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional cultures and
induces reversion phenotype. A, MCF-7 cells stably
expressing either scrambled shRNA or two independent
shRNAs against hAda3 were grown in phenol red–free
Matrigel in three-dimensional tissue culture system in the
presence or absence of 100 pmol/L E2. After 16 days of
growth incubation, the images were taken under phase
microscopy with either 4 or 15 objective. B, at least
200 acinar structures from different fields were counted
and plotted as a percentage of total counted. Colony size
was measured using the NIH Image J 1.34 program and
was defined by size as small (0.004–0.01 cm2), medium
(0.01–0.3 cm2), or large (0.3 cm2 or more).

expression of estrogen-responsive genes and estrogen-dependent
cell proliferation (32, 33). Furthermore, SRC-3 deletion suppressed
MMTV-v-Ha-ras transgene–induced mammary tumorigenesis in
mice (34). Complementing these studies development and function
of mammary gland, as well as other female reproductive tissues, is
affected in SRC-1 / , SRC-2 / , or Src-3 / mice (32–35). Thus, the
requirement for endogenous Ada3 for HAT recruitment to ER target
gene promoters and, in ER-dependent functional responses,
functions ascribed to SRC proteins was therefore surprising. Several
potential models can explain why both Ada3 and SRC proteins may
be required to promote ER-dependent gene expression and func-

tional responses. One possibility is that these proteins play similar
but redundant roles. Second, it is possible that a multiple coactivator
protein play temporally distinct roles, accounting for their obligatory, rather than redundant, roles. In this regard, p300 together
with SRC-3 was found to be rapidly and transiently (15–30 min after
E2 addition) associated with ER-responsive CATD promoter,
whereas PCAF was found associated much later (45 min; ref. 36).
Finally, it is possible that Ada3 and SRC proteins are components of a
supramolecular coactivator complex and loss of either protein
induces loss of functional complex. Using glycerol gradient
cosedimentation and immunoprecipitation analyses, we showed

that Ada3 is present in the same complex as ER, as well as three HATs
(p300, PCAF, and Gcn5), consistent with the model that Ada3 is a
critical component of a large complex (composed of Ada3, Ada2,
Gcn5, p300, and PCAF), which plays an essential role in transcriptional activation by ER and potentially other transcriptional
activators. Future studies using combinatorial knockdown in cells
and compound mouse knockouts should help test these models.
Ada3 was initially identified as a core component of the yeast
ADA coactivator complex that includes an adaptor protein Ada2,
which in turn associates with a HAT protein Gcn5 (37). Ada3
interacts directly with the activation domains of transcriptional
complexes, thus serving as a key component in the recruitment of
Ada complex and its associated HAT activity to transcriptional
activators bound to specific promoters. Given our current
observations that Ada3 facilitates the recruitment of multiple
HATs, including Gcn5, to ER target promoters, and recent studies
indicating that Ada3 (and other Ada components) assemble into
multiple complexes that can vary significantly from the trimolecular yeast ADA complex, Ada3 may play multiple functional roles in
the context of different transcriptional activators. Adding to this
complexity, mammalian cells seem to contain a Gcn5 complex that
does not include Ada2 (38). Similarly, two distinct Ada2 proteins
exist in higher eukaryotic cells, and studies in Drosophila show that
both Ada2 proteins are essential for development, indicative of
distinct functions (39, 40). In general, however, Ada3 has been
found as an invariant component of many ADA-related complexes
in mammals and other higher eukaryotic cells, suggesting a pivotal
role of Ada3 in coactivator functions of these complexes. In
addition, Ada3 has emerged as a binding partner of the human

ADA3, a putative transcriptional adaptor, consists of
two separable domains and interacts with ADA2 and

papilloma virus E6 oncoprotein (15), suggesting the possibility that
viral oncoproteins may alter the function of Ada3 during
oncogenesis. Thus, detailed analysis of Ada3 and mechanisms of
its function are likely to elucidate basic regulation of gene
expression, as well as its aberrations in cancer.
In conclusion, we provide evidence that Ada3 associates with and
is required for the recruitment of multiple HAT proteins (p300, Gcn5,
and PCAF) to ER target gene promoters and that Ada3 is required
for ER-mediated cell proliferation. Future studies using total and
mammary gland targeted knockout mice should further delineate
the important role of Ada3 versus other known ER coactivators, such
as SRC1 to SRC3 in ER function, either as redundant regulators or as
part of a single complex of temporally coordinated coactivator
complexes. Elucidation of the role of coactivators in ER function
should provide insights relevant to normal reproductive tissue
development and function, as well as oncogenesis.
