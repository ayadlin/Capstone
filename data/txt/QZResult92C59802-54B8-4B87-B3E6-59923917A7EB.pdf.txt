Abstract
Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in primary human colorectal cancer (CRC) by in situ
immunohistochemical staining supports the hypothesis that the adaptive immune response influences the
course of human CRC. Specifically, high densities of TILs in the primary tumor are associated with good
prognosis independent of other prognostic markers. However, the prognostic role of TILs in metastatic CRC
lesions is unknown, as is their role in response or resistance to conventional chemotherapy. We analyzed the
association of TIL densities at the invasive margin of CRC liver metastases with response to chemotherapy
and progression-free survival in a set of 101 large section samples. High-resolution automated microscopy on
complete tissue sections was used to objectively generate cell densities for CD3, CD8, granzyme B, or FOXP3
positive immune cells. A predictive scoring system using TIL densities was developed in a training set and
tested successfully in an independent validation set. TIL densities at the invasive margin of liver metastases
allowed the prediction of response to chemotherapy with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. The
association of high density values with longer progression-free survival under chemotherapy was statistically
significant. Overall, these findings extend the impact of the local immune response on the clinical course from
the primary tumor also to metastatic lesions. Because detailed quantification of TILs in metastatic lesions
revealed a strong association with chemotherapy efficacy and prognosis, we suggest that the developed
scoring system may be used as a predictive tool for response to chemotherapy in metastatic CRC. Cancer Res;

being the most frequent site of distant metastases (1). In 20%
of patients, liver metastases can be resected with curative
intent (2). Neoadjuvant treatment can improve resectability,
but the majority of the patients have nonresectable liver
metastases and receive palliative chemotherapy (3). The overall prognosis of patients receiving systemic palliative chemotherapy is very limited with a median overall survival of
approximately 24 months (4). Modern chemotherapy regimens include monoclonal VEGF or epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) antibodies and lead to objective response
rates of around 40% to 60% (4), whereas a large proportion of
patients experience treatment-related side effects without any
clinical benefit. The only established predictive markers are
K-Ras mutations in the tumor, which predicts nonefficacy to
treatment with EGFR antibodies (5). So far, no biomarkers are
available that help to select patients that are likely to respond
to chemotherapy. Immune cells infiltrating or surrounding
colorectal primary tumors (6) and especially tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) represent important prognostic factors
(7, 8). High densities of TILs were shown to be correlated with
an improved survival in patients with primary CRC (9–14). In

Immune Infiltration and Response to Chemotherapy

Study design and concept
Records of patients with metastatic CRC who underwent
diagnostic excision (or primary resection) of liver metastases
or liver biopsy at different high-volume centers between 1998
and 2008 were reviewed and suitable samples were retrieved.
Immune cell infiltrates at the invasive margin of CRC liver
metastases were analyzed and correlated with response to
chemotherapy in a total of 101 patients with metastatic CRC.
For 33 patients, material from diagnostic excisions (during
resection of the primary tumor or laparoscopy) and detailed
follow-up, including progression-free survival under chemotherapy, were available. The samples from this patient
cohort were used as a training set (see Supplementary Information) to generate a scoring system ("density score") to be
used to predict treatment response. Samples from 68 other
patients were used as a validation set. For the latter, only
dichotomous response data were available. Patient data and
samples from metastatic CRC patients without treatment
were not available. Immune cell antigens were selected on
the basis of literature data, where an association with prognosis but not with treatment response was already identified
and independently confirmed in primary CRC (CD3, CD8, and
granzyme B). The density and distribution of FOXP3-positive
regulatory T cells in metastatic CRC is still unclear and was
therefore also analyzed. The term "prognostic marker" is used
throughout this article according to the REMARK Guidelines.

the SLK Klinikum Heilbronn. No patient died during the
observed period. Follow-up for each patient included the
complete time period until remission or disease progression
occurred and overall survival.
The independent validation set consisted of samples from
patients treated at the aforementioned facilities (22 patients)
and from the prospective multicenter CELIM trial (46
patients), investigating neoadjuvant treatment of nonresectable liver metastases. Patients in the CELIM trial had agreed to
a needle liver biopsy or the use of previously acquired biopsies
or sections from diagnostic excisions from the liver metastases for EGFR immunohistochemistry and for further scientific evaluation. Details of this trial are reported elsewhere (3).
All 101 patients received chemotherapy (irinotecan-based,
platinum-based, 5-FU) either with or without concomitant
antibody therapy (cetuximab or bevacizumab; see Supplementary Information)
In this study, patients were included with stage UICC IV
CRC after metastatic disease was histologically proven.
Included samples either consisted of large liver biopsies
and partially resected liver metastases ("technically nonresectable," see Supplementary Fig. S1) or diagnostic excisions.
All tissue investigated had to contain at least more than 1 mm2
of evaluable invasive margin (see Supplementary Fig. S2). All
patients received (palliative) chemotherapy that was begun
within 8 weeks after diagnosis. So the patients in this study are
from a rare, but clinically highly informative, subgroup among
all patients with CRC. Other patient inclusion criteria were a
Karnofsky performance score of at least 80% and adequate
hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function. Patients with
synchronous liver metastasis were included if the primary
tumor had been resected before chemotherapy. Supplementary Table S1 shows the clinical characteristics of both sets of
patients. Before start of chemotherapy and every 4 cycles
(usually 2 months), staging was conducted by computed
tomography or MRI. Response to chemotherapy was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST). In our investigation, response was defined
as partial (or complete) remission or progressive disease.
Patients with stable disease after initiation of chemotherapy
were further monitored under the same treatment until either
disease progression or remission occurred. Evaluations were
conducted by review of blinded radiologists or as reported
previously (3) and best (unconfirmed) responses were used in
this analysis. Tumor samples were typed for microsatellite
instability using the polymorphic markers BAT25, BAT26, and
CAT25 as described earlier (20) and all metastases were of
microsatellite stable status.

Clinical data
The study was approved by the local ethics committees.
One hundred one tumor samples of metastatic CRC liver
metastases were used for this study after obtaining signed
informed consent from all patients. Progression-free survival
was defined as the time from the beginning of palliative
chemotherapy until disease progression (failure) and was only
available for the training set of 33 patients, consisting of
samples from the University Medical Center Heidelberg and

Immunohistochemical staining
Tissue specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed
for their infiltration with CD3, CD8, granzyme B, and
FOXP3-positive T cells. Tissue sections (4 mm) were prepared
from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the slides were boiled in 10 mmol/L
citrate buffer (pH ¼ 6) for 15 minutes to retrieve the antigens.
The endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation
with 0.6% H2O2 in methanol for 20 minutes. The sections were

clinical course of CRC has not been analyzed systematically so
far. The role of specific immune cell subpopulations and the
role of the immune system in mediating response or resistance to conventional chemotherapy in metastatic CRC is also
not clear (15). Only in few patients, a diagnostic excision or
biopsy is taken from the liver metastasis before chemotherapy
is initiated, so availability of material is limited. Examining a
small series of samples from primary colorectal tumors and
corresponding liver metastases, we have found marked
differences between infiltrate densities on the invasive
margin of liver metastases (16). Following these preliminary
observations, we have now analyzed TIL infiltrates in a large
cohort of metastatic CRC patients using objective highthroughput quantification of immune cells on large whole
slide sections (17–19). We describe here for the first time a
strong association between immune cell density in the
invasive margin of CRC liver metastases and chemotherapy
response, highlighting the importance of the local immune
response in metastatic CRC.

blocked with 10% normal horse serum (VECTASTAIN Elite

Acris), CD8 (1:40 dilution; clone 4B11; Novocastra), GrB
(1:50 dilution; clone 11F1; Novocastra), and FOXP3 (1:100
dilution; clone 236A/E7; Abcam) were applied as primary
antibodies at room temperature for 2 hours. The slides were
incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (1:50
dilution; horse-anti-mouse IgG; VECTASTAIN Elite ABC
kit; Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes at room temperature and AB reagent was applied according to the
manufacturer's instructions (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit;
Vector Laboratories). The antigen detection was conducted
by a color reaction with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB þ
chromogen; Dako Cytomation). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (AppliChem) and mounted with
Aquatex (Merck).
Evaluation of immunohistochemical variables
The number of stained immune cells was counted using a
computerized image analysis system consisting of an NDP
Nanozoomer from Hamamatsu Photonics attached to a personal computer. Complete microscopic images of full tissue
sections were automatically obtained for later automatic or
visual analysis (virtual microscopy), allowing large scale histologic evaluation with high precision across the complete
section. Thus, varying cell densities across the complete tissue
section can be measured objectively. In this analysis, the
average cell density across the measured region was used
for analysis. The invasive margin was defined as a region of 500
mm width on each side of the border between malignant cells
("metastasis" and peritumoral stroma) and liver tissue (see
Supplementary Information).
Manual evaluation of stained immune cells was conducted (in duplicates) without knowledge of the clinicopathologic data by 2 independent observers. Variations in
the enumeration within a range of 5% were reevaluated
and a consensus decision was made. The results were
expressed as the mean of positive stained cells per mm2. A
total of 1,002 mm2 of tissue surface area was analyzed,
with a minimum of 1 mm2 of invasive margin per sample.
Manual cell counts were reassessed with a specifically
developed software program (VIS software suite; Visiopharm) to measure cell densities across a given region
of interest (on average 10 mm2, with up to 40 mm2) as
reported previously (17). The automated cell counts confirmed the manual cell counts, so that the automated
quantification was applied to the validation set of 68
patients, avoiding observer bias (17). All evaluations were
visually checked for consistency.
Statistical analyses
Primary aim of the study was to evaluate the use of TIL
densities to predict response to chemotherapy. A training
set of 33 patients was considered to derive a prediction
model based on CD3, CD8, and granzyme B cell densities
as input variables of the model. In the literature, the
prognostic role for FOXP3 cell densities is unclear for

5672

Cancer Res; 71(17) September 1, 2011

metastatic CRC, therefore these cell densities were analyzed in a second exploratory step (see Supplementary
Information). For the other immune cell surface markers,
we applied recursive partitioning by conditional inference
trees to develop a scoring system to be used as prediction
rule (21). The algorithm works as follows: (i) Test the
global null hypothesis of independence between any of
the input variables and the response. Stop if this hypothesis cannot be rejected. Otherwise select the input variable
with strongest association to the response. This association
is measured by a P value corresponding to a test for the
partial null hypothesis of a single input variable and the
response. (ii) Implement a binary split in the selected input
variable. (iii) Recursively repeat steps (i) and (ii). An
independent set of 68 patients was used to evaluate this
prediction model. A secondary analysis was conducted to
analyze the prognostic value of the derived scoring system
with respect to time to progression by proportional
hazards regression. Survival curves were computed using
the Kaplan–Meier estimator.
To compare clinicopathologic characteristics between the
training and the validation set, the exact Mann–Whitney test
was used for continuous variables. To compare categorical
data, Fisher's exact test was applied.
All statistical analyses were conducted with R version 2.11.0
together with the R package party, version 0.9 (22).

Results
The evaluation of the invasive margin of metastatic liver
lesions showed striking variations in TIL densities at the
invasive margin between different patients (Fig. 1) as was
noted previously (16). While the center of the metastasis often
contains large areas of necrosis, making objective evaluations
difficult, the invasive margin with its clear border showed a
clear heterogeneity of TIL densities between patients also in
this larger patient cohort. For the invasive margin, in the
training set of 33 patients, a scoring system ("density score")
was developed to differentiate between patients with different
levels of TIL densities and to test whether TIL densities were
related to chemotherapy response. An independent set of 68
patients ("validation set") was used to validate the scoring
system with respect to response prediction. Classification by
recursive partitioning of the observed TIL densities (CD3, CD8,
and granzyme B) of the 33 metastatic lesions classified as
responder or nonresponder in the training set revealed the
following prediction rule (see Supplementary Fig. S3): Patients
having a CD3 cell count above 572 cells/mm2 and either a CD8
density of higher than 170 cells/mm2 or a granzyme B density
of higher than 23 cells/mm2 are predicted to respond to
therapy. For practical reasons, the finally derived rule required
a CD3 cell count above 600 cells/mm2 and either a CD8 density
of higher than 200 cells/mm2 or a granzyme B density of
higher than 25 cells/mm2. To incorporate this prediction rule
into a scoring system, a density score was generated. A CD3
density above 600 cells/mm2 receives double impact, CD8 and
GranB have single weight ("2þ1þ1"). The range of the score is
therefore from 0 to 4, where patients with a score from 0 to 2

addition of granzyme B and CD8 evaluation in the scoring
system allowed a more reliable classification than cell counts
for CD3 alone.
The distribution of clinical parameters was investigated:
age and gender as well as chemotherapeutic regimen distributions were similar between the training and validation set.
Information with regard to the distribution of age, gender,
localization, immune cell distribution, microsatellite status,
antibody treatment, and chemotherapeutic regimens can be
found in Supplementary Table S1.
To further corroborate these findings, the use of the scoring
system to predict progression-free survival in the training set
was analyzed. Despite initial success of chemotherapy,
patients can have short intervals to disease progression and
response to chemotherapy not necessarily leads to prolonged
treatment periods with the same treatment regimen (23). With
respect to progression-free survival, significant differences

between the groups with density scores from 0 to 2 ("low
density") and 3 þ 4 ("high density") were found (training set:
P < 0.001). Figure 2A shows the corresponding Kaplan–Meier
plot of groups with scores 0 to 2 and 3 þ 4. Estimated HR for
patients with score 3 or 4 was 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02–0.20) in the
training set. Similar results could be found in the overall
survival analysis (Fig. 2B), where a statistically significant
difference was found between the 2 groups (log-rank test,
P < 0.001). Including additional covariates (age, gender, chemotherapy, and antibody treatment) did not change the
results for the scoring system. The scores of all 33 patients
and the corresponding density score groups are shown in
Figure 3.
On the basis of the above developed scoring system, the
response of patients from the validation set could be predicted
with high accuracy in the validation set. The estimated prediction error was 14.7% with a 95% CI ranging from 8.2%
to 25.0%. All 21 nonresponders of the validation set were

correctly predicted, specificity being 100% (95% CI: 85%–

patients who responded to treatment were predicted to be
nonresponders, sensitivity therefore being 79% (95% CI: 65%–
88%). This might be explained by the high rate of needle
biopsies among these misclassified patient samples (see Supplementary Information).

Additional analysis of FOXP3-positive regulatory T-cell
densities in a subset of 20 patients from the training set
revealed that their number is generally low in the invasive
margin of metastatic CRC liver metastases (see Supplementary Information). CD3-positive T cells outnumbered FOXP3positive lymphocytes by 50–100 to 1. FOXP3-positive regulatory T cells also did not show differences in distribution
between responders and nonresponders.

Immune Infiltration and Response to Chemotherapy

Discussion
The densities and localization of TILs in metastatic liver
lesions of CRC have not been investigated in detail. While
findings reported by Galon et al. (9) corroborated the prognostic significance of TILs in the primary CRC tumor across all
tumor stages and showed a clear role for effector T cells, the
relation of infiltrate densities and response to chemotherapy
in patients with metastatic CRC (stage IV) was not analyzed.
Likewise, the prognostic impact of infiltrates at the site of the
metastases has not been investigated in detail so far. As
patients with metastatic CRC frequently undergo surgery to
remove the primary tumor, the metastases are often the
remaining tumor tissue.
Here, we show for the first time a strong association
between the local immune cell profile and chemotherapy
outcome in CRC liver metastases. This clearly extends the
observed role for the immune system in primary CRC also into
metastatic lesions and further into chemotherapy efficacy. For
the first time in CRC, ample tumor tissue was analyzed with
the remainder of the tumor tissue being monitored during
therapy. Previous work is mainly based on small tissue samples, but clear associations of heterogeneous immune cell
densities and clinical aspects require a large-scale tissue
evaluation (see Fig. 4). This situation is also in contrast to
other work that analyzed only the adjuvant situation, where
the complete metastatic burden is removed and any adjuvant
treatment is given without knowledge of remaining tumor
cells (24). Another advantage of our approach was that the
here reported association was validated in an independent
patient cohort. Also, the immune cell density showed a significant prognostic effect on the progression-free survival
under chemotherapy. T-cell densities at the invasive margin
of metastatic lesions showed considerable differences
between patients who responded to chemotherapy versus
nonresponders (16). The invasive margin of the metastatic
liver lesion and the invasive margin of the primary tumor both
constitute the boundary where malignant cells are in contact
with presumably nonmalignant tissue. While metastatic
malignant cells certainly have a different phenotype from
nonmetastatic tumor cells, an immunologic distinction (e.
g., in immune cell activation) has not been shown between
metastatic and nonmetastatic cells. Our data show that
response to chemotherapy is associated with a high T-cell
density at the invasive margin of metastatic lesions. In addition, there was a significant association of high T-cell numbers
with good prognosis (Figs. 2 and 3). The relative low percentage of nonresponders to chemotherapy (27%) in our cohorts
may be surprising but could be explained by a selection bias
for patients undergoing surgery for presumably resectable
metastatic disease. Furthermore, the validation cohort consisted mainly of patients from a large multicenter trial (3) in
which a high response rate was reported that may explain the
above observation. The presented patient cohort is unique, as
larger numbers of samples from diagnostic excisions of liver
metastases with ample invasive margin are difficult to obtain.
Standard clinical procedure includes only fine-needle biopsies
of (suspected) metastases, if any at all. These standard

biopsies then often do not include an invasive margin area.
Surgical specimens, however, allow ample evaluation of tissue
sections, especially with regard to invasive margins. This
might be an explanation for the misclassified patient samples:
a high rate of 7 needle biopsies of 10 samples among the
misclassified patient samples. The observed heterogeneity of
infiltrate density at the invasive margin within the same
patient (see Fig. 4 for 3 different patient samples) might be
the source for higher misclassification on smaller areas of
invasive margin. Only whole slide quantification allows therefore to generate robust cell quantities along large stretches of
invasive margin.
Previous work by others showed a prognostic significance
for T-cell infiltrates at the invasive margin of the primary
tumor underlining the importance of immune reactions (9,
13). The cutoff values for T cells (at the invasive margin of liver
metastases) used for response prediction in this set of patients
are similar to the cutoff values defined by previous work in
primary tumors (9). The primary site of interaction between
malignant cells and immune cells is the invasive margin in
both primary tumors and in metastases, showing considerable
variation in immune cell composition (see Fig. 4; ref. 16). This
concordance in cutoff values points to an underlying general
relation between proliferating cancer cells and an active
immune response. So our observation in metastatic lesions
supports the findings in the primary tumor with respect to the
prognostic implication and represents the first detailed evaluation of TILs in partially removed metastatic liver lesions. A
complete evaluation of the response to chemotherapy would
of course require a comparative analysis including patients
without chemotherapy, which is unethical in the metastatic
setting. These observations, however, raise important questions about the treatment of patients and might help to
identify metastatic CRC patients likely to benefit from chemotherapy.
The 2 cohorts included different patients with a range of
various different chemotherapy and (immunologic) antibody
treatment regimens and combinations. Nevertheless, the association between immune cell density and treatment outcome
could be detected. As for the effects of chemotherapy on the
immune system, 5-fluorouracil is included in all treatment
regimens and can at least partially deplete or transiently
inactivate inhibitory immune cells (25). Oxaliplatin induces
immunogenic cell death (25) but in our investigation, it did
not show clear superior effects compared with irinotecan. As
different chemotherapeutic agents have different immunologic effects, they might as well have different "threshold levels"
for the immune cell density to have a good prognostic impact,
"threshold levels" that could not be delineated in the current
study. For antibodies, the immunologic aspects are well
recognized (25), but what is the effect of chemotherapy on
immune cells? One important mechanism of chemotherapy
might be the immunomodulation, that is, suppression of
inhibitory immune cell function, allowing the surrounding
T cells to infiltrate and attack cancer cells. This is a hypothesis
that is in line with the cancer immunosurveillance theory
developed by Dunn and colleagues (26–28) and Koebel and
colleagues (29) which suggests that tumors are controlled by

5676

Cancer Res; 71(17) September 1, 2011

the immune system (equilibrium phase) and eventually escape
immunosurveillance (30). The precise elements of this immunosurveillance or immunoediting are unknown. In mouse
models, the administration of chemotherapy could selectively
deplete regulatory T cells while sparing effector T cells and
enhancing dendritic cell function (31). Other studies indicate a
possible role for regulatory T cells specifically in human CRC
(32). As their numbers are very low in metastatic CRC liver
metastases, they do not seem to have large impact in the
metastatic situation. Recent data from CRC patients supported the idea that the complex network of inhibitory and
activating immune signals seems to change during the course
of the disease (33, 34) and there are of course other inhibitory
(immune) cell populations that also have potent suppressive
functions on effector T cells (e.g., myeloid-derived suppressor
cells) that also could be affected by chemotherapy (35). In an
expression profiling study on the invasive margin of CRC liver
metastases by Lassmann and colleagues, mRNA levels of
cyclin D1 and survivin, 2 genes involved in cell proliferation
and antiapoptosis, were associated with hepatic recurrences
(36). As a hypothesis, these upregulated transcripts could also
come from "resistant" inhibitory immune cell subpopulations,
thereby effectively hindering the above-mentioned effects of
chemotherapy on this subset of immune cells.
Our results show the distribution and detailed localization of
T cells at the tumor site-–and especially at the invasive margin
of liver metastases of CRC. The observed densities at the liver
metastases imply a similar impact of these cells as observed in
primary CRC tumors. The presence of the infiltrates is linked
with successful chemotherapy in metastatic CRC. This observation could have implications for the treatment of patients
with advanced CRC. The analysis of immune responses at the
site of metastatic disease might help to select patients likely to
benefit from systemic treatment and on the other hand,
prevent patients unlikely to respond from treatment-related
side effects. These findings can aid in the development of a new
staging system for advanced CRC (37). Taken together, the
presented data will have implications for the assessment of
treatment options for patients with metastatic CRC.
