Abstract
Author Manuscript

Phosphorylated sphingolipids [ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)]
have emerged as key regulators of cell growth, survival, migration, and inflammation1–5. C1P
(Fig. 1a) produced by ceramide kinase is an activator of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2α
(cPLA2α), the rate-limiting releaser of arachidonic acid used for pro-inflammatory eicosanoid
production3,6–9, which contributes to disease pathogenesis in asthma/airway hyper-responsiveness,
cancer, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis. To modulate eicosanoid action and avoid the damaging
effects of chronic inflammation, cells require efficient targeting, trafficking, and presentation of
C1P to specific cellular sites. Vesicular trafficking is likely10 but nonvesicular mechanisms for
C1P sensing, transfer, and presentation remain unexplored11,12. Moreover, the molecular basis for

selective recognition and binding among signaling lipids with phosphate headgroups, namely C1P,
phosphatidic acid (PA) or their lyso-derivatives, remains unclear. Herein, an ubiquitouslyexpressed lipid transfer protein (CPTP) is shown to specifically transfer C1P between membranes.
Crystal structures establish C1P binding via a novel surface-localized, phosphate headgroup
recognition center connected to an interior hydrophobic pocket that adaptively expands to
ensheath differing-length lipid chains using a cleft-like gating mechanism. The two-layer, αhelically-dominated ‘sandwich’ topology identifies CPTP as the prototype for a new GLTP-fold13
subfamily. CPTP resides in the cell cytosol but associates with the trans-Golgi/TGN, nucleus, and
plasma membrane. RNAi-induced CPTP depletion elevates C1P steady-state levels and alters
Golgi cisternae stack morphology. The resulting C1P decrease in plasma membranes and increase
in the Golgi complex stimulates cPLA2α release of arachidonic acid, triggering pro-inflammatory
eicosanoid generation.

During screening of the NCBI human genome database, we noted an in silico predicted
transcript (GenBank NP_001025056.1; glycolipid transfer protein-containing-domain-1;
GLTPD1) encoding a protein sharing sequence identity (17%) with glycolipid transfer
protein (GLTP). Although annotation indicated glycolipid binding and transport activity,
Lys and Arg substitutions occurred at key positions (N52, W96) essential for sugar
headgroup recognition by GLTP (Supplementary Fig. S1a; yellow highlights)13–14. We
validated GLTPD1 mRNA transcript expression in human tissues, finding wide-spread
occurrence and relatively elevated transcript levels in placenta, kidney, pancreas and testis
(Fig. 1b). Cloning and heterologous expression revealed that purified GLTPD1 (GenBank
JN542538) transfers anthrylvinyl-C1P (AV-C1P) between 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer vesicles in protein concentration-dependent
fashion (Fig. 1c,d,; Supplementary Fig. S1b,d) requiring acceptor membranes
(Supplementary Fig. S1c). Testing of lipid specificity revealed no transfer of
galactosylceramide (GalCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), sphingomyelin (SM),
phosphatidyl-choline (PC), phosphatidic acid (PA), or ceramide (Cer) by GLTPD1 (Fig.
1c,d). Slow-down of AV-C1P transfer by potential lipid ligands (nonfluorescent) showed no
‘competition effect’ by S1P (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. S1e,f) and a transfer rate of ~4
C1P molecules/min/protein at 37°C. GLTPD1 was designated ceramide-1-phosphate
transfer protein (CPTP).

The crystal structure of human CPTP/16:0-C1P complex (1.9 Å, Table S1) revealed a twolayered, all α-helical topology (Fig. 1f,g) homologous with GLTP-fold13. αN, α1 and α2
form one layer, α4, α5 and α8 form another layer, and α3, α6 and α7 localize along the
periphery of the two-layer core. A positively-charged surface cavity for anchoring the lipid
headgroup (Fig. 1h) extends through a gateway portal, transforming into a deep interior
hydrophobic cavity that accommodates the sphingosine and acyl chains. αN-helix (Leu10
and Leu14) impart pocket-like features by sealing the bottom. A triad of cationic residues
(K60, R106, R110) in the surface cavity recognizes and binds the C1P phosphate headgroup
(Fig. 2a). The anchoring H-bond network is complex, involving bifurcated hydrogen
bonding by K60 (α2-helix) with the O1 and O2 atoms, bidentate hydrogen bonding by R106
(α4-helix) with the O2 and O3 atoms, and bidentate hydrogen bonding by R110 (α4-helix)
directly and via water bridging to O3. Point mutation supports key roles for K60 and R106

in C1P headgroup recognition with K60A and R106L showing almost no C1P transfer,
while R110 mutation (R110L) shows ~40% transfer (Fig. 2b). The positive-charge of this
site also is enhanced by R97 (α3–4 loop) which hydrogen bonds to the O2 atom of
phosphate via water-bridging. R97 is almost fully active when mutated to L (R97L), but
mutation to acidic E (R97E) reduces C1P transfer to ~55%, supporting its role for attracting
the lipid phosphate headgroup. Cation-pi interaction between R113 (α4-helix) and Y149
(α5–6 loop) provides stabilizing underpinning for the site (Supplementary Fig. S2c), as
R113 mutation (R113L) strongly diminishes activity. Mutants Y149A, R113E, and R113L
show poor C1P transfer, as expected by conformational destabilization (Fig. 2b). All key
residues of the phosphate recognition site appear to be conserved in eukaryotes
(Supplementary Fig. S2a).

The hydrophobic pocket is lined by ~25 nonpolar residues, mainly Phe, Leu, Val, and Ile
(Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. S2b) that prevent water entry while ensheathing the ceramide
aliphatic chains. Mutation of L43, L118, or L146 to positively-charged R or V57 or V158 to
high polarity N compromises hydrophobic pocket functionality and strongly diminishes C1P
transfer (Fig. 2d). More conservative mutation (e.g. W117A) only moderately reduces C1P
transfer, while F42A near the pocket bottom stimulates C1P transfer. Mutation near the
entry portal (I53N) or in the flexible α1–2 loop (F50R) is well tolerated (75–80% active)
(Fig. 2d). Ceramide entry is oriented by hydrogen bonding of the lipid amide oxygen and
nitrogen with H150 and D56, respectively. Hydrogen bond disruption between lipid amide
nitrogen and D56 (D56V) moderately slows C1P transfer, but H150 mutation (H150L)
abolishes activity. Superpositioning of apo- and 16:0-C1P/CPTP structures (rmsd 1.4 Å)
shows K60, R106 and R110 nearly identically positioned in the positively-charged surface
cavities. Yet, large conformational differences exist for I53, W36, W119 and F52 (Fig. 2e)
due to closer packing of certain α-helices in apo-CPTP (Supplementary Fig. S2d,e). Many
Leu and Phe are repositioned, reducing the solvent accessible (SA) volume (40 Å3) (Table
S4) and effectively collapsing the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 2f,g) compared to 16:0-C1P/
CPTP complex (364 Å3).

Author Manuscript

CPTP adaptability for different C1P species is reflected in structures of CPTP complexed
with C1P containing differing-length acyl chains (Fig. 2h–k; 3a–f; Supplementary Fig. S4c–
f). Two lipid-binding conformational modes are apparent. In ‘sphingosine-in’ mode, both
ceramide chains occupy the hydrophobic pocket; whereas, only the acyl chain occupies the
pocket in the ‘sphingosine-out’ mode. For 12:0-C1P/CPTP complex (Fig. 2h–j), both
binding modes occurred in the same asymmetric unit (Fig. 2i, j; Supplementary Fig. S3c,d;
S4a,b) enabling comparison (Fig. 2k) under closest possible conditions. The lipid phosphate
headgroups and amide groups bind exactly as in 16:0-C1P/CPTP complex (Supplementary
Fig. S2b; S3a,b). In sphingosine-out mode (Fig. 2j; Supplementary Fig. S3d), a bend in
sphingosine at C6 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with V153, V154 and the D56
Cβ atom, enabling outward projection. Sphingosine cross-bridging interactions with F50,
I149, A157 and V153 of neighboring, symmetry-related CPTP stabilize further
(Supplementary Fig. S4b). SA pocket volumes reflect the altered sphingosine location, i.e.
261 Å3 for sphingosine-out versus 329 Å3 for sphingosine-in (Table S4). In 18:1-C1P/CPTP
complex (Fig. 3a, b), the cis-double bond kink in the acyl chain increases separation from

the sphingosine chain, maximally expanding the pocket (stereo view; Supplementary Fig.
S4c,d) while leaving the overall chain length in the pocket similar to 16:0-C1P.
Accordingly, the SA volume of the hydrophobic pocket of 18:1-C1P/CPTP is larger (387
Å3) (Table S4) than in 16:0-C1P/CPTP where slightly closer packing by the saturated acyl
chain decreases the SA volume (364 Å3). Shortening the acyl chain length reduces SA
pocket volumes to 104 Å3 for 8:0 and 263 Å3 for 2:0 (Table S4). Structures for 2:0-C1P/
CPTP and 8:0-C1P/CPTP are detailed in Supplementary Fig. S3a,b, S4e,f and Discussion.

Author Manuscript

The functional consequences of CPTP hydrophobic pocket structural adaptability become
clear upon transfer analyses. Pocket expansion accommodates ceramide aliphatic chains in
‘molecular ruler’-like fashion with CPTP adaptability limits optimized for 16:0- or 18:1-C1P
species which are particularly effective competitors at slowing the AV-C1P transfer rate
(Fig. 3g), consistent with maximal pocket expansion and optimal fit (Table S4). It is
noteworthy that C1P containing long lignoceryl (24:0) acyl chains are not very effective
competitors, suggesting poor accommodation in the hydrophobic pocket because of
adaptation limitations. Also 16:0-C1P with dihydrosphingosine base competes less
effectively than 16:0-C1P with naturally-prevalent sphingosine base.

Author Manuscript

Structure determination of di12:0-PA/CPTP complex elucidated the molecular basis of PA
non-transfer (Supplementary Fig. S5a–h; Table S1). PA occupies the same binding site and
its phosphate group interacts with the same positively-charged residues as C1P
(Supplementary Fig. S5b–d). Yet, K60 hydrogen bonding is single rather than bifurcated,
and the lack of the acyl-amide moiety results in no hydrogen bonding with D56, distorting
the position of the phosphate headgroup and both lipid chains and loosening PA binding.
The distorted interaction mitigates PA transfer by CPTP (Supplementary Fig S5e–h and
Discussion).
CPTP architecture not only represents a novel motif for specific binding of phosphosphingolipids, but is previously unknown for any phosphate-modified biomolecule15–17. In CPTP,
the fixed cationic residues of the phosphate recognition site undergo minimal
conformational change upon C1P binding. B-factor distribution analyses show the regions
between α1-α2 and α5-α6 are most flexible (Supplementary Fig. S6a,b), consistent with a
cleft-like gating mechanism facilitating ceramide chain entry/exit. The conserved lipid
orientation in the pocket, with the nonpolar acyl chain always inside regardless of
sphingosine being in or out, supports a concerted mechanism of action in which the acyl
chain enters first and leaves last during membrane interaction (Supplementary Fig. S6c,d
and Discussion).

The conformational adaptability of the inherently flexible, single-cavity, hydrophobic pocket
of CPTP contrasts with lipid cavities in fatty acid binding proteins which use β-barrels/βcups to generate a large, solvent-filled binding site that remains conformationally fixed
whether or not occupied by fatty acid18. A single, fixed, lipid binding cavity also is
characteristic of START lipid binding domains in PC transfer protein19 and CERT20, which
uses an α/β fold built around an incomplete U-shaped β-barrel to bind ceramide21
(Supplementary Fig. S7 and Discussion).

In the human genome, the differing origins of CPTP and GLTP are clear. CPTP (214 aa) is
encoded by a 3-exon transcript originating from GLTPD1 on chromosome 1 (locus
1p36.33). GLTP (209 aa) is encoded by a 5-exon transcript originating from GLTP on
chromosome 12 (locus 12q24.11)22. The shared folding topology encoded by GLTPD1 and
GLTP, despite only limited sequence homology (Supplementary Fig. S8a–e) and different
lipid specificity, provides a striking example of evolutionary convergence and emphasizes
the structural premium placed by eukaryotes on conservation of this fold23–25. The related
architectures of CPTP and GLTP, but with naturally-evolved and remarkably different lipid
headgroup specificity (Supplementary Discussion), suggest that ‘Sphingolipid Transfer
Protein (SLTP) Superfamily” might better reflect the existence of the two major subfamilies:
CPTP, with selectivity for ceramide-linked phosphates; and GLTP, with selectivity for
ceramide-linked sugars.

In cells, CPTP tracked by monospecific antibody or fluorescent epitope tag (EGFP) is
cytosol-localized but also associates with peri-nuclear membranes (e.g. Golgi/TGN/
endosomes), nuclei, and plasma membranes (Fig. 3n–s; Supplementary Fig. S9). No
localization to mitochondria, lysosomes, or ER is detected. CPTP co-localization with
TGN-46 verified interaction with trans-Golgi/TGN, a site where ceramide kinase (CERK)
generates C1P3,26–28 and led us to hypothesize a C1P regulatory/sensing role for CPTP
during CERK-mediated metabolic/signaling events. siRNA-induced CPTP down-regulation
(~90%; Supplementary Fig. S10a) elevated both 16:0-C1P and 24:1-C1P (~4-fold) (Fig. 4a)
and fragmented the Golgi cisternal stacks (Supplementary Fig. S11). RNAi-induced C1P
changes were partially rescued with moderately-active R110L and K60N, but not with
inactive K60A and R106L mutants (Fig. 4b). CPTP overexpression in the absence of RNAi
decreased 16:0-C1P and 24:1-C1P. K60A or R106L overexpression had the opposite effect
(Supplementary Fig. S12) and fragmented the Golgi cisternal stacks (not shown) consistent
with a dominant-negative effect. CPTP depletion measurably decreased sphingosine and
S1P (Supplementary Fig. S10b,c), 14:0-, 22:0-, 24:1-, and 24:0-SM, 16:0monohexosylceramide, and 24:0-Cer, but modestly increased 24:1-Cer (Supplementary Fig.
S10d–f and Discussion). Subcellular fractionation showed increased 16:0-C1P levels in
‘heavy’ membranes (trans-Golgi/endosome-enriched) and nuclear fractions, and decreased
levels in plasma membranes without affecting levels in ‘light’ membranes (cis-Golgi/ERenriched). These CPTP-depletion induced effects were rescued by ectopic wtCPTP
expression (Fig. 4g; Supplementary Fig. S13c and Discussion).

Because CERK-generated C1P induces Group IVA cPLA2α activity which releases
arachidonic acid (AA) used to produce pro-inflammatory eicosanoids26,27, CPTP
involvement was assessed. In siRNA-induced CPTP-depleted cells, arachidonic acid
increased (Fig. 4c) consistent with C1P accumulation at the Golgi/TGN that activates
cPLA2α26. Also elevated were major AA metabolites generated by cyclooxygenase (COX),
lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome p450 (CYP) pathways, i.e. PGE2, PGF2α, 6-ketoPGF1α (COX, Fig. 4d); 5HETE, 8HETE, 12HETE (LOX, Fig. 4e); 11,12 EET (CYP, Fig.
4f). By contrast, AA and eicosanoid levels decreased upon overexpression of wtCPTP but
not K60A or R106L mutant (Supplementary Fig. S14). Parallel siRNA-induced downregulation of CERK (Supplementary Fig. S10), the only established producer of C1P in

mammals, decreased 16:0-C1P (Fig. 4a), AA (Fig. 4c), and eicosanoids (Fig. 4d–f) elevated
by CPTP depletion.

Author Manuscript

Figure 4h depicts a model showing how CPTP could regulate pro-inflammatory eicosanoid
generation. In mammals, the only established pathway for C1P production is via
phosphorylation of ceramide by CERK at the cytoplasmic surface of the trans-Golgi/
TGN3,28. CERK also contains nuclear localization/export signals and traffics to the plasma
membrane via microtubule-driven vesicles in response to hyperosmotic shock28. To produce
C1P, CERK uses ceramide delivered from its ER synthetic site to the Golgi by either
CERT27 or possibly by vesicular trafficking10. C1P elevation by CERK is known to activate
soluble cPLA2α by enhancing translocation to the trans-Golgi/TGN3,26 where cPLA2α
action releases AA needed by eicosanoid producers such as COX-1 or COX-2. siRNAinduced CPTP depletion elevates C1P in the Golgi complex and nucleus, but lowers C1P
plasma membrane levels. We propose that CPTP prevents excess C1P accumulation after
production by CERK, thereby regulating cPLA2α action, diminishing AA release and
downstream generation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. One destination for CPTP-cargo is
the plasma membrane. Models involving CPTP in catabolic C1P generation by
sphingomyelinase D are less plausible because mammalian cells lack this enzyme3
(Supplementary Discussion).

Author Manuscript

Previously, the only identified mechanism for regulating CERK-mediated production of C1P
was by control of ceramide availability via ceramide transfer protein27. It is noteworthy that
siRNA-induced CPTP depletion yields the highest increase in endogenous C1P reported to
date, mostly as 16:0-C1P, and dramatically alters Golgi cisternal stack morphology
suggesting CPTP-mediated transport is essential for maintaining proper Golgi organization
by safeguarding localized C1P levels. The ensuing stimulation in eicosanoid production
triggered by elevated C1P in the Golgi complex potentially implicates CPTP in as of yet
unidentified disease states associated with inflammation.

Protein Expression and Purification

Author Manuscript

GLTPD1 ORFs encoding human and mouse (GenBank JN542538 & NP_077792.2) CPTP
were cloned in pET-SUMO vector (Invitrogen) and expressed in BL21 (DE3) Star cells
(Invitrogen). Soluble CPTP tagged N-terminally with His6-SUMO was affinity-purified by
Ni-NTA chromatography followed by ubiquitin-like protein 1 (Ulp1) SUMO protease
digestion overnight at 4°C to release His6-SUMO tag. Affinity repurification by Ni-NTA
chromatography was followed by FPLC gel filtration chromatography. L-selenomethionine
(Se-Met)-labeled protein for ab initio phasing was produced by feedback inhibition of the
methionine synthesis pathway. Mutants were constructed by QuikChange Site-Directed
Mutagenesis (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing.
CPTP Lipid Transfer Activity Involving Membrane Vesicles
Intermembrane lipid transfer by CPTP was measured in real time by Förster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) between donor POPC vesicles, containing 1 mole% AV-lipid [acyl
chain omega-labeled with anthrylvinyl fluorophore, i.e. (11E)-12-(9-anthryl)-11Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 March 12.

dodecenoyl], and 1.5 mole% 1-acyl-2-[9-(3-perylenoyl)-nonanoyl]-3-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine [Per-PC] and POPC acceptor vesicles at 10-fold excess. In competition
assays, donor vesicles also contained competitor lipids at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mole%29. Briefly,
CPTP addition produces an exponential increase in AV emission intensity (425 nm) as the
protein transports AV-C1P away from the donor vesicles (creating separation from the
‘nontransferable’ Per-PC) and delivers to the POPC acceptor vesicles present in 10-fold
excess. The time-dependent increase in 425 nm emission relative to signal in the absence of
CPTP reflects lipid transfer kinetics. In the absence of acceptor vesicles, no transfer is
observed. The initial lipid transfer rate, νo, is obtained by nonlinear regression analyses (see
Supplementary Methods).
Crystallization and Structure Determination

Author Manuscript

Crystallization hits from initial screens were optimized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion
method and systematically varying pH and individual component concentrations (Table S3).
For data collection, crystals were flash frozen (100 K) in reservoir solutions containing 20%
(v/v) ethylene glycol. Diffraction data sets were collected on 24-ID-C and 24-ID-E
beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and X29 beamline at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. All crystals belonged to different crystal forms. For phasing, single-wavelength
anomalous dispersion (SAD) data were collected for Se-Met-labeled, CPTP/8:0-C1P crystal
complex at Se peak wavelength (Table S2; see Supplementary Methods). Use of Se-CPTP
structure enabled other structures to be solved by molecular replacement (Supplementary
Methods). Statistics for data collection, refinement and SAD phasing are provided in Tables
S1 and S2.
Epifluorescence Microscopy Analyses

BSC-1 cells on coverslips were fixed in −20 °C methanol and labeled with anti-CPTP (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology sc247014), and Golgi markers anti-TGN46, anti-GM 130, and antip230, or endosome markers anti-Rab5 and anti-Rab9 (Cell Signaling) followed by
secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa-488, Alexa-594, or Alexa-660. Cells were counterstained with DAPI, mounted in 10% PBS, 90% glycerol, imaged using a Leica DM RXA2
microscope with a 63x 1.4 NA APO C objective, a Hamamatsu ORCA ER CCD camera,
and Simple PCI software and analyzed as intensity scattergrams with measured correlation
coefficients30. Time-lapse images of living cells expressing EGFP-CPTP were captured with
a Leica DM RXA2 microscope stand equipped with a Yokagawa CSU-10 spinning disk
confocal head and using illumination from a Coherent 488 nm 200mW “Sapphire”
continuous wave optically pumped solid-state laser and 3I Slidebook software31 (see

Immunoblot Analysis
BSC1 cells were grown to semi-confluence, collected by manual scraping, pelleted, and

siRNA-mediated CPTP Down-regulation and Rescue in Cells Ectopically Expressing
Wildtype and Mutant CPTP Constructs

Author Manuscript

Low passage A549 cells (5×105) were grown (10-cm plates) in appropriate medium under
standard incubator conditions (SIC) overnight. Cells were treated with siRNA (Dharmacon)
against CPTP (GLTPD1) or CERK as well as non-targeting siRNA sequence for control per
manufacturer’s protocol and incubated for 48 h under SIC. For rescue experiments, cells
were transfected with either the empty pFLAG-CMV4 (Neor) plasmid or this vector
containing wtCPTP, K60A-CPTP, K60N-CPTP, R106L-CPTP, or R110L-CPTP. Batch
cultures of cells stably expressing the transfected constructs were obtained by selection for
two weeks in regular medium containing G418 (genticin; 500μg/ml) under SIC. Following
selection, cells (5×105) were transferred to 10 cm tissue culture plates and cultured
overnight in regular media without G418 under SIC. Cells then were treated with either
control siRNA or a mixture of 4 siRNA constructs (Dharmacon) designed against the 3′
UTR of endogenous CPTP (GLTPD1) mRNA following standard manufacturer’s protocol
(Supplementary Methods). The 3′UTR was not included in the ectopically-expressed
constructs to ensure siRNA targeting only to endogenous CPTP. Cells were incubated 48 h
in regular media without G418 under SIC. Full serum media was replaced with media
containing 2% serum 15 h prior to harvest.
RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription-PCR, and Quantitative PCR

Author Manuscript

To evaluate downregulation of CERK and CPTP, quantitative PCR was performed26.
Briefly, total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kits (Qiagen). Total RNA (1 μg) was reversetranscribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The level of CERK
transcript was monitored using quantitative PCR and TaqMan technology (Applied
Biosystems) specific to CERK and CPTP with 18 S as control. cDNA was amplified using
an ABI 7900HT with premixed primer-probe sets and TaqMan Universal PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems).
Intracellular Sphingolipid Analyses

Author Manuscript

Cell lipids were harvested using an improved Bligh-Dyer protocol32 (Supplementary
Methods). Sphingolipids were separated by HPLC (Prominence HPLC system, Shimadzu)
using a Kinetix-C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 2.6μ; Phenomenex) and eluted using a linear
gradient (solvent A, methanol:water:formic acid (58:41:1) in 5 mM ammonium formate;
solvent B, methanol:formic acid (99:1) in 5 mM ammonium formate, 20–100% B (3.5 min)
and at 100% B (4.5 min); flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, 60°C). ESI-tandem-MS (API 4000
QTRAP instrument; Applied Biosystems, MDS Sciex) was used to detect C1P32, ceramide,
sphingosine, S1P, sphingomyelin, and monohexosyl ceramide under positive ionization (see
Supplementary Methods).
Eicosanoid Analysis
Eicosanoids were analyzed as detailed by the Lipid Maps Consortium33,34. Culture media (4

(15HETE), (d8) 14,15 epoxyeicosa-trienoic acid and (d8) arachidonic acid. Samples and vial
rinses (5% MeOH; 2 ml) were applied to Strata-X SPE columns (Phenomenex), previously
washed with methanol (2 ml) and then dH2O (2 ml). Eicosanoids eluted with isopropanol (2
ml), were dried in vacuuo and reconstituted in EtOH:dH2O (50:50;100 μl) prior to HPLC
ESI-MS/MS analysis (see Supplementary Methods).
Subcellular Fractionation
Subcellular fractionation was performed by multi-step centrifugation as detailed and
characterized previously27 with minor modifications (see Supplementary Methods). Fraction
enrichment was validated by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S13b) using
organelle markers for: nuclei (anti-lamin AC, trans-Golgi (anti-TGN46), ER (anti-protein
disulfide isomerase (PDI)), and plasma membrane (anti-caveolin-1).

eicosanoid production. C1P is synthesized by ceramide kinase (CERK) which concentrates
in the trans-Golgi network vicinity via its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain during
stimulation. To produce C1P, CERK uses ceramide transported from the ER by ceramide
transfer protein (CERT) which also contains a targeting PH domain. After synthesis, C1P is
transported to subcellular destinations by CPTP and possibly by vesicular trafficking. RNAi
knockdown of CPTP (red X) leads to accumulation and elevation of C1P at the Golgi
complex, a condition that activates soluble cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α),
releasing AA needed for generation of downstream, pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. CPTP
overexpression has the opposite effect on lipid levels. cPLA2α activation occurs by
translocation from the cytoplasm and/or cis-Golgi (red arrows) via enhanced anchoring to
C1P generated by CERK in TGN. COX-1 and inducible COX-2 which use AA to produce
pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, also concentrate in the trans-Golgi/TGN vicinity during
stimulation. For clarity, other eicosanoid generator pathways, i.e. LOX (e.g., cytoplasmic 5lipoxygenase) and CYP (ER-associated cytochrome P-450), are not depicted. Also not
depicted is Golgi cisternal stack fragmentation induced by 24 h of CPTP RNAi.
