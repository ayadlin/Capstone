ABSTRACT
Zoledronic Acid (ZA) rapidly concentrates into the bone and reduces skeletalrelated events and pain in bone metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), but exerts only a
limited or absent impact as anti-cancer activity. Recently, we developed self-assembling
nanoparticles (NPS) encapsulating zoledronic acid (NZ) that allowed a higher intratumor
delivery of the drug compared with free zoledronic acid (ZA) in in vivo cancer models of
PCa. Increasing evidence suggests that Bone Marrow (BM) Mesenchymal stromal cells
(BM-MSCs) are recruited into the stroma of developing tumors where they contribute
to progression by enhancing tumor growth and metastasis.
We demonstrated that treatment with NZ decreased migration and differentiation
into adipocytes and osteoblasts of MSCs and inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Treatment
with NZ reduced the capability of MSCs to promote the migration and the clonogenic
growth of the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. The levels of Interleukin-6
and of the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and FGF-2 were significantly reduced in
MSC-CM derived from MSCs treated with NZ, and CCL5 secretion was almost totally
abolished. Moreover, treatment of MSCs with supernatants from PC3 cells, leading
to tumor-educated MSCs (TE-MSCs), increased the secretion of IL-6, CCL5, VEGF and
FGF-2 by MSCs and increased their capability to increase PC3 cells clonogenic growth.
Treatment with NZ decreased cytokine secretion and the pro-tumorigenic effects also
of TE-MSCS. In conclusion, demonstrating that NZ is capable to inhibit the cross talk
between MSCs and PCa, this study provides a novel insight to explain the powerful
anticancer activity of NZ on PCa.

INTRODUCTION

Therefore, ZA and especially NZ may represent a
potential therapeutic approach for breast and PCa, since it
is potentially able to decrease the supportive role of TME
and in particular of MSCs.
Here, we have compared the functional effects
of free ZA and NZ on osteoblastic and adipocytic
differentiation of MSCs, on osteoclast differentiation of
monocytes and on the capability of MSCs- conditioned
medium to promote the migration and proliferation of PCa
cells.

MSCs are pluripotent progenitor cells that
contribute to the maintenance and regeneration of a
variety of connective tissues, including bone and adipose
tissue [1–4]. MSCs recruited and then “educated” by
tumor cells, through direct and/or indirect interaction
with tumor cells, can support tumor growth, promote
angiogenesis, inhibit the development of an efficient antitumor response, induce drug resistance, invasion and even
metastases [1–7]. MSCs participate in prostate cancer
(PCa) carcinogenesis and growth [8] and are recruited and
activated into Carcinoma-Associated Fibroblasts (CAF)
by molecules secreted by the Tumor Microenvironment
(TME)[9]. Thus, disrupting the interactions between
PCa cells and MSCs could represent a new therapeutic
strategy [10].
Zoledronic acid (ZA) is a biphosphonate used for
many years to reduce skeletal complications related to
the benign and malignant bone diseases characterized by
enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption [11]. ZA exerts
biological activity on MSCs differentiation [12] and
inhibits the secretion by MSCs of cytokines involved
in breast cancer cell migration [13] and in monocytes
recruitment [14]. In PCa cellular models ZA impairs
PCa-induced M2-macrophages polarization and prevents
the M2 macrophages-mediated activation of normal
fibroblasts [15].
Although ZA inhibits proliferation and migration
of cancer cells and induces apoptosis in vitro [16], it
has negligible effects on different tumors in vivo, due to
fast uptake by bone tissue that limits the amount of the
drug reaching the extra-skeletal tumor niches as well as
to its rapid elimination from plasma upon intravenous
administration due to renal excretion [17].
Nanotechnology has been used to improve the
therapeutic index of new or established drugs by
modifying drug absorption, prolonging biological
half-life and reducing toxicity [18–20]. Recently, to
increase  ZA plasma half-life and accumulation into
tumors, new self-assembling PEGylated nanoparticles
(NPs) encapsulating ZA (NZ) was developed,
transforming this biphosphonate in a powerful anticancer agent [21, 22].
NZ offers good technological characteristics, in
terms of homogeneous size distribution and high drug
loading and a strong increase of ZA anti-cancer activity
in vivo [21, 22]. NZ reverts multidrug resistance in
lung cancer [23] and its combination with doxorubicin
overcomes simultaneously chemo-resistance and
immune-resistance in breast cancer [24] thus suggesting
its future clinical development as anticancer agent
[22]. In Prostate cancer (PCa) models, NZ induces
the complete remission of tumor xenografts with low
toxicity, reduces tumor-associated macrophages [22] and
inhibits angiogenesis [22].

RESULTS
Characteristics of self-assembling nanoparticles
PEGylated ZOL-containing NPs were prepared by
mixing CaPZ NPs (final ZOL concentration 0,125 mM)
with DOTAP/chol/DSPEG2000 cationic liposomes. The
resulting self-assembling NPs had a mean diameter of
about 147 nm with polydispersity index < 0.2. According
to previously published papers [21] the nanoparticles had
a positive zeta potential, of about 18 mV.

Effects of NZ on MSCs viability and migration
ZA was shown to significantly affect MSCs
migration whereas it has a slight effect on proliferation
[13]. We treated MSCs with increasing concentrations of
NZ and for comparative purposes with ZA. Thereafter,
we evaluated proliferation and migration of MSCs. Free
ZA did not significantly affect MSCs growth and NZ only
slightly decreased viable cells (about 20% of inhibition
at the highest drug concentration)(Figure 1A). However,
treatment with NZ decreased in a dose dependent manner
MSCs migration and, at the low concentrations, it was
more active than ZA (Figure 1B). Blank NPs did not
significantly affect MSCs proliferation or migration.

Effects of NZ on osteoblast, adipocyte and
osteoclast differentiation
We next evaluated the effects of NZ or ZA on
osteoblastic (OB) and adipocytic (AD) differentiation
in MSCs and on osteoclast (OC) differentiation in
monocytes.
MSCs were treated with NZ or ZA using a pulse
treatment (high drug concentration for a short time).
Treatment with NZ (Figure 2A) and especially with ZA
(Figure 2B) inhibited AD differentiation (Figure 2A and
2B, upper panel) (Oil-red-O staining). In agreement with
Ebert et al. [12], free ZA increased OB differentiation
(Figure 2B, lower panel). Conversely, NZ decreased
MSCs differentiation into OB (Alizarin red staining)
(Figure 2A, lower panel). Blank nanoparticles (NPs,
control) never affected OB or AD differentiation (data
not shown).

ZA blocks pathologic bone resorption by inhibiting
OC function and then by inducing apoptosis [1, 26].
Consistently, we found that also treatment with NZ, as
with free ZA, decreased in a dose dependent manner
osteoclast differentiation of monocytes (Figure 2C).

levels of cytokines/chemokines secreted by MSCs and
known to be involved in prostate cancer progression. We
treated MSCs with increasing amounts of NZ or ZA,
and then we quantified the secretion of IL-6, CCL5,
IL-8, VEGF and FGF-2. Treatment of MSCs with NZ
(10-20 μM) decreased IL-6 secretion of about 40%
(Figure 4A) and almost totally abolished the secretion
of CCL5. Only at the lowest NZ concentration (10 μM)
a slight increase of IL-8 was observed (Figure 4A). The
secretion of the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF (about
40%) and especially of FGF-2 (about 80%) (Figure 4A)
was significantly decreased following treatment with
NZ. ZA treatment of MSCs, as previously reported [13],
used at the same concentrations, increased IL-8 but was
less active than NZ in decreasing IL-6, VEGF and CCL5
levels (Figure 4B).

Effects of NZ on prostate and breast cancer cells
migration induced by MSCs-CM
MSCs increase the motility of PCa [25] and breast
[13] cancer cells. We found that CM from MSCs increased
of about 4-folds the migration of PC3, DU145 and MCF7 cells. CM from ZA-treated MSCs showed a reduced
capacity to promote the migration of MCF-7 breast cancer
cells [13].
We found that also NZ decreased in a dosedependent manner the ability of MSCs-CM to promote
the migration of PC3 and DU145 cells (Figure 3A); the
same effect was observed when MSCs were treated with
ZA (Figure 3B). The treatment of MSCs with NZ, as well
as with ZA, reduced the migration of MCF-7 breast cancer
cells in response to MSCs-CM and was active [13] even
at the lowest (10 μM) drug concentrations (Supplementary
Figure 1A).

Effects of NZ on the clonogenic growth induced
by MSCs-CM
We have previously demonstrated that MSCs-CM
increased the clonogenic growth of PCa cells [5]. Thus,
we evaluated the effects of NZ as well as free ZA on the
ability of MSCs-CM to support the clonogenic growth of
prostate cancer cells (Figure 5). MSCs-CM increased in
a dose-dependent manner the number of colonies formed
by PC3 cells (Figure 5). Treatment of MSCs with free
ZA and especially with NZ inhibited the capability of
MSCs-CM to increase the clonogenic capacity of PC3
cells (Figure 5).

Effects of NZ on cytokines/chemokines secretion
by MSCs
To investigate the potential mechanism responsible
for the downstream effects of NZ, we measured the

To survive and proliferate cancer cells not only
recruit but also shape or “educate” normal cells [26]. We
found that treatment or “education” of MSCs (TE-MSCs)
with PC3 cells-CM increased the secretion of IL-6, CCL5,
VEGF and FGF-2 by MSCs (Figure 6A). Treatment of
TE-MSCs with NZ decreased the secretion of IL-6, CCL5,

radiotherapy resistance [4, 6, 26–30]. Thus, drugs capable
of disrupting microenvironmental interactions mediated
by MSCs may represent a valid approach to treat human
cancer [4, 26], including PCa.
In this study, we demonstrated that NZ, new selfassembling nanoparticles encapsulating ZA, were able
to induce the following effects: i) decreased MSCs
migration; ii) inhibited adipocyte, osteoblast and osteoclast
differentiation; iii) decreased the secretion of chemokines
and angiogenic factors by MSCs; iv) decreased the
capability of CM from MSCs to potentiate clonogenic
growth and migration of PCa cells.
In advanced stage PCa patients are often diagnosed
with bone metastases. PCa cells prevalently cause
osteoblastic lesions, characterized by an excess of bone
formation but in many patients, osteoblastic and osteolytic
metastatic lesions coexist [31–34]. Therefore, the ability
of NZ to decrease osteoclast as well as osteoblastic
differentiation could potentially counteract both bone
destruction mediated by osteoclasts and the formation of
the osteoblastic niches.

Adipocytes from AT or BM [31, 32, 35–38] can
promote cancer progression in PCa and in breast cancer,
suggesting this cell type as a new potential target for
therapeutic intervention [39–41]. In our study, ZA as
well as NZ inhibited adipocytic differentiation of MSCs
but NZ, able to accumulate not only in the bone but
also in the extra skeletal tissues, may represent a better
therapeutic option respect to ZA. This is in line with the
fact that clinical trials have shown that ZA treatment is
effective in reducing skeletal-related events and bone pain
in bone metastatic PCa cancer, but exerts only a limited
or no impact on survival [42], likely because it rapidly
accumulates into the bone but reaches only low intratumor concentrations.
On the other hand, NZ exerts its primary anticancer
activity by killing cancer cells [22] and may inhibit the
interactions of tumor cells with MSCs not only in the
bone as ZA, but also in the primary tumor and in extra
skeletal metastasis. It is worthy of note that in this study
NZ was more effective than ZA also in vitro, suggesting
that the use of self-assembling NPs can represent an

advantage not only to accumulate ZA in tumor tissue,
but also to enhance the ZA uptake into the target cells,
as previously reported [21, 22, 43], or possibly to reduce
the risk of side effects, such as osteonecrosis of the jaws
[21, 44]. At the moment the exact mechanism for which
NZ is more active than ZA is unknown. However, the
authors hypothesize that NZ can enhance the uptake of
ZA into the cells. Other authors demonstrate that ZA
enter into the cells by dynamin dependent endocytosis;
the same authors found that the intracellular uptake
was significantly enhanced in the presence of calcium
or following ZA encapsulation into the liposomes. The
self-assembling developed in this work are based on
calcium salt and cationic lipids, the latter well known
as transfection agents for polyanionic molecules such
as nucleic acids. Thus, considering their composition
(calcium and cationic lipids), it is reasonable to
hypothesize that NZ could significantly increase the
intracellular uptake of encapsulated ZA, compared to
naked ZA.
PCa cells, by producing large amounts of cytokines/
chemokines, can attract inflammatory cells and MSCs in
the TME. In turn, tumor-educated MSCs can recruit and
then interact with immune cells [12, 48], can increase
PCa cell motility and promote metastasis [27, 49] or exert
protective effects against chemotherapy [14, 50]. Thus, NZ
by decreasing the capability of MSCs to recruit PCa and
breast cancer cells might decrease the formation not only
of bone metastasis as free ZA, but also of extra-skeletal
metastasis.
High levels of both IL-6 and of CCL5 correlate
with bad prognosis and an advanced metastatic stage in
prostate and breast cancer [45, 46]. PCa cells express a
functional CCR5 receptor [47] and CCL5 signals from
infiltrating MSCs increase PCa stem cell population
and PCa metastasis [8, 48]. Breast cancer cells express
CCR5 receptor which controls survival, invasiveness and
metastatic ability [49]. Thus, NZ, by reducing IL-6 s and
completely abolishing CCL5 secretion by MSCs may
counteract the consequences of MSCs/PCa [8, 13, 25, 46,
50, 51] and MSCs/breast cancer [49, 52, 53] interactions.
Furthermore, decreasing chemokines secretion by MSCs
may reduce the recruitment of monocytes in the TME [54].
Given that angiogenesis is necessary to sustain
tumor growth and cancer progression, development
and/or discovery of new antitumor agents capable
of inhibiting both tumor growth and angiogenesis is
of paramount importance [55]. Given that MSCs of
the tumor microenvironment produce large amounts
of pro-angiogenic factors to generate the new vessels
needed for cancer cells growth [3, 56], the inhibition of
their secretion may represent an additional therapeutic
strategy [56]. We found that NZ decreased the release by
MSCs, and also by TE-MSCs, not only of chemokines
but also of the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and FGF-2.
The observed down-modulation of IL-6, CCL5, VEGF
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and FGF by ZA and NZ was specific since no reduction
of IL-8 was observed.
MSCs recruited by tumor cells seems to contribute
not only to TME formation but also to tumor growth [4].
Recently, we found that CM from MSCs and especially
from TE-MSCS increased PC3 cell colony growth [5]. Our
data, showing that MSCs-CM from NZ and ZA treated
cells resulted less active in increasing the clonogenic
growth of PC3 cells, suggested that ZA and especially NZ
may decrease the protumorigenic effects of MSCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs
Free ZA, used for comparative purposes, was
from Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland). Selfassembling nanoparticles encapsulating Zoledronic acid
(NZ) were prepared and characterized as previously
reported [21]. Blank self-assembling nanoparticles were
used as control.

Cell lines and culture conditions
Human Bone Marrow-MSCs (Lonza, Verviers,
Belgium) were maintained in MSGM bullet kit (Lonza).
They are positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, and
CD166 and negative for markers of the hematopoietic
lineage, such as CD14, CD34, and CD45. The human
PCa-derived PC3 and DU145 cell lines (DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany) were maintained in RPMI
medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and
0.1% (w/v) L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C in a
5% CO2 fully humidified atmosphere. The human breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 (HTB-22) (ATCC, Rockville,
MD, USA) was maintained in DMEM medium (SigmaAldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS; penicillin/
streptomycin, L-glutamine, 1mM sodium piruvate
(Gibco, Italy) and 1% MEM non-essential amino acid
solution (Sigma-Aldrich).

Generation of tumor educated-MSCs
(TE-MSCs) and preparation of conditioned
medium from BM-MSCs and TE-MSCs
To generate TE-MSCs, MSCs were cultured for 9
days in the presence of 10% of PC3-CM (3 additions). To
obtain CM from MSCs and TE-MSCs, cells were cultured
for 72 h in the presence or in the absence of NZ (10, 20, 30
μM) or ZA, then washed and incubated for additional 24
h in serum free (SF) medium. Conditioned medium (CM)
from MSCs (MSCs-CM) and TE-MSCs (TE-MSCs-CM)
were collected, filtered, aliquoted and stored at -20°C.

concentrations of NZ or ZA (25,50,100 nM). After 14
days of culture cells were used for tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase- (TRAcP) staining. To quantify the
formation of TRAcP positive multinucleated cells, cell
cultures were stained with Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase
Kit (Sigma Diagnostics), according to manufacturer's
instruction. Cells positive for TRAcP and having more
than three nuclei were considered as TRAcP-positive
multinucleated OCs.

CCL5 (Pierce Biotecnology, Rockford, IL, USA),
IL-6 (R&D System, Minneapolis, USA), IL-8 and VEGF
(Immunological Sciences, Rome, Italy) and FGF-2
(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) levels were assayed by
ELISA assay, according with manufacturer’s instructions.

Proliferation and colony assay
MSCs (2×103) were cultured in 96-well flatbottomed plates, allowed to adhere for 24 h and then
treated with NZ or ZA (15-30 μM) or blank nanoparticles
(NPs). After 72 h, proliferation was evaluated by MTT
assay. For clonogenic growth, 100 PC3 cells were plated
in 24-well flat-bottomed plates, allowed to adhere for 24
hours, then cultured in the presence and in the absence
of CM derived from tumor-educated MSCs (TE-MSCs)
or MSCs cultured with or without NZ or ZA (20 μM).
After 7 days, plates were observed under phase-contrast
microscopy and colonies counted.

Cell motility assay
Migration was assessed by FATIMA assay as
previously described [5, 60]. Briefly, MSCs (50.000 cells/
insert) treated with NZ or ZA (10, 20, 30 μM), were tagged
with the lipophylic dye Fast DiI (Molecular Probes) and
then seeded in 150 μl SF medium in the upper side of
fibronectin-coated Boyden chamber inserts. DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS was used as chemoattractant.
In other experiments PC3 and DU145 cells (100.000
cells/inserts) were tagged with the lipophylic dye Fast
DiI (Molecular Probes) and then seeded in 150 μl SF
medium in the upper side of fibronectin-coated Boyden
chamber inserts. Conditioned medium from MSCs treated
or not with NZ or ZA were used as chemoattractants.
Migration was monitored at different time intervals,
using a computer-interfaced GeniusPlus microplate
reader. FATIMA software determined the percentage of
transmigrated cells out of the total amount introduced into
the system.

MSCs differentiation
MSCs (1×104) were cultured in 24-well plates
and allowed to attach and then treated as described
[12]. Briefly, at about 80% cell confluence, cells were
pre-treated with 10 and 20 μM NZ or ZA for 6 h and
then incubated, after a medium change, in osteogenic
medium (OM) (50 nM ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerol
phosphate and 100 nM dexamethasone; Sigma-Aldrich)
or in adipogenic medium (AM) (10 ng/mL Insulin, 1
μM dexamethasone, 60 nM indomethacin, and 0.5 mM
isobutylmethyl-xanthyne; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 weeks
(pulse treatment). Images were taken using an inverted
microscope (Eclipse TS/100; Nikon Instruments, Campi
Bisenzio, Italy) with photomicrographic systems DS
Camera Control Unit DS-L2 (magnification 100x0.25).
Osteogenic and adipocyte differentiation was
assessed by Alizarin Red staining (Sigma-Aldrich) and
with Oil Red-O staining (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.

Software and statistical analysis of data
Values are presented as the mean with the standard
deviation (mean ± SD) of three independent experiments.
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
6 Software (GraphPad, San Diego, California, USA). The
significance of differences was determined by Student's
t-test for comparison between two groups. Analysis of
Variances (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the correlation
of data among three or more groups; consecutive multiple
comparison analysis was performed using Dunnett’s
or Tukey’s tests. P<0.05 was considered statistically
significant. *P <0.05; **P <0.01; ***P <0.001; ****P
<0.0001, treated vs control.

Osteoclastogenic assay and TRAcP staining
Osteoclasts (OCs) were obtained as previously
described [5, 59]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were obtained from buffy coat preparations
from healthy donors and separated on Ficoll-Hypaque
(Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). PBMC were seeded at
optimal density, incubated for 2h at 37°C and then washed
three times with PBS to remove non-adherent cells.
Cultures were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10%
FCS, human M-CSF (Peprotech, London) (30 ng/ml),
and human RANKL (Peprotech) (40 ng/ml). Cells were
fed every 3 days with fresh medium and differentiating

CONCLUSIONS
ZA was recently used in association with Dasatinib
for the treatment of Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis with
good responses [57]. NZ, like ZA [13], inhibited the
migration of MSCs and reduced the secretion of growth
factors involved in breast cancer progression.
Therefore, since free ZA reaches only low intratumor concentrations, this new nanotechnology-based
formulation, able to accumulate also in the extra skeletal

block the cross-talk between MSCs and tumor cells, thus
representing a valid alternative to ZA for the treatment of
non-osseous metastases, not only in PCa but also in breast
cancer.
