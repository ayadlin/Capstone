BACKGROUND. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are active agents in advanced urothelial
cancer. BMS-247550 (ixabepilone) has activity in preclinical models in paclitaxel
resistant models. A phase 2 trial of this epothilone was performed to determine
the activity and toxicity of this agent in a multi-institutional setting in patients
previously treated with 1 prior chemotherapy regimen.

METHODS. Forty-five patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma were treated
with BMS-247550 40 mg/m2 over 3 hours intravenously on Day 1 of a 21-day

dvanced transitional cell carcinoma is a moderately chemosensitive neoplasm. The M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin) regimen, long considered the standard initial
regimen for advanced disease, has gradually been replaced by the
gemcitabine 1 cisplatin (GC) doublet based on a phase 3 trial comparing M-VAC to GC that demonstrated comparable activity with a
somewhat improved toxicity profile favoring GC.1
Over the last 15 years a large number of new agents and combination regimens have been tested in advanced urothelial cancer.
Many of these agents including paclitaxel, pemetrexed, and docetaxel have exhibited activity against advanced transitional cell carcinoma, although none of the doublets/triple combinations studied to
date have demonstrated improved survival compared with the MVAC regimen.2–5
During the past 2 decades a clinically evident stage migration6
has led to earlier appreciation of metastatic disease. Concomitantly
there has been an increased utilization of neoadjuvant and adjuvant
chemotherapy resulting in an increasing proportion of patients fit

enough to be considered for second-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Recent phase 2 studies
evaluating second-line chemotherapy have demonstrated objective response rates in the 10% to 25%
range for a variety of single agents and combination
regimens.7–9
The epothilones are novel nontaxane tubulin polymerization agents obtained by fermentation of the
myxobacteria Sorangium cellulosum. Aza-epothilone
B (BMS-247550; ixabepilone) is a semisynthetic analog of the natural product epothilone B.10 In preclinical models epothilones A and B have broadspectrum antineoplastic activity as demonstrated
against several human cancer xenografts including
paclitaxel-resistant tumors.11 In preclinical models
(BMS-247550; ixabepilone) paclitaxel-resistant tumor
xenografts were also highly susceptible to the antitumor action of BMS-247550.12
Phase 1 trials of BMS-247550 (ixabepilone) tested
several different schedules including a 60-minute
infusion every 21 days, a daily-times-5 every 21-day
schedule, and daily-times-3 every 21-day schedule.
Antitumor responses were seen in patients with a variety of epithelial cancers, many previously treated
with paclitaxel- or docetaxel-containing regimens. A
dosing schedule of 40 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks as
a single agent was recommended and adopted for
phase 2 testing.13–15
Based on the demonstrated activity of taxanes in
advanced urothelial cancer, the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) investigated BMS-247550
(ixabepilone) therapy in patients with progressive
advanced urothelial cancer after front-line chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma (or mixed histologies containing a component of transitional cell carcinoma) of
the urothelium with evidence of progressive, bidimensionally measurable regional or metastatic disease. Patients must have been disease-free from prior
malignancies for at least 5 years, with an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 at entry. Patients must have
demonstrated progressive disease after 1 and only 1
prior cisplatin- or carboplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen (minimum of 4 weeks from completion
of therapy), which may have been given in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant or metastatic setting and may
have included a taxane. Patients must have been at
least 4 weeks out from major surgery. Adequate renal
and hepatic function were required with a serum
creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase

(AST) 2.5, and bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit
of normal. Adequate bone marrow reserve was mandated with a requirement for neutrophils 1500
mm3 and a platelet count 100,000/lL at entry.
Patients with significant congestive heart failure,
severe ventricular arrhythmias, or grade 2 or greater
peripheral neuropathy were excluded. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients.
BMS-247550 was administered intravenously
over 3 hours at a dose of 40 mg/m2 on Day 1 with
cycles repeated every 21 days, but were not started
until the absolute neutrophil count was 1500/lL,
the platelet count 100,000/lL. Dose modifications
of up to 50% were mandated for febrile neutropenia
or neurotoxicity.
Before study entry, all patients underwent physical examination and had their ECOG performance
status and weight documented. There also were pretherapy complete blood count (CBC) and differential,
serum creatinine, BUN, AST, bilirubin, and computed
tomograms (CT) of chest and/or abdomen. A CBC
and the above chemistries were repeated on the first
day of each subsequent therapy cycle. Tumor measurements were performed with each cycle of therapy
if determined by physical examination or every other
cycle if evaluation required chest radiographs or CT
scans.
Each site was required to have approval of this
clinical trial by a local Human Investigations Committee in accord with an assurance filed with and
approved by the Department of Health and Human
Services. All patients provided written informed consent before registration onto this study.
Tumor responses were analyzed using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.
National Cancer Institute (NCI) common toxicity criteria (CTCAE version 2) were used to analyze toxicity.
Patients with objective responses or stable disease
were continued on therapy until development of
unacceptable toxicity.
At the time the study was designed a response
rate of 25% or greater was considered to represent
activity that would be of interest. A response rate of
10% would represent an agent not worth further
study. The study was designed with 2 stages of
accrual. Twenty patients were planned for the first
stage of accrual. If 2 or more responses were
observed among the first 17 eligible patients the
study was planned to accrue up to an additional 25
patients (23 eligible). If 7 or more responses were
observed among 40 eligible patients, the treatment
would be considered worthy of further study.
Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the
characteristics of the patients at study entry. Exact

binomial confidence intervals were computed for
response rates. The method of Kaplan and Meier16
was used to characterize overall survival and progression-free survival. Overall survival was computed
from the time of registration to death. Progressionsurvival was computed from the time of registration
to death or progression, whichever occurred first. For
patients who were still alive and progression free,
then that patient was censored at the date of last disease assessment.

RESULTS
From May of 2001 through January of 2005, 45
patients from 17 ECOG institutions were entered to
the study and were evaluable for toxicity. Three
patients were deemed ineligible, 1 having received 2
previous chemotherapy regimens and 2 patients who
did not have baseline disease measurements within 4
weeks of registration. All 42 eligible patients had
tumors that were histologically pure or predominantly transitional cell carcinoma. The bladder was
the primary site of disease in 33 patients. There were
multiple sites involved in 10 patients, with 9 patients
each having renal pelvis lesions, 8 ureteral, and 2
urethral disease. Thirty patients underwent primary
surgical resection (21 cystectomy, 9 nephrectomy)
Three patients had received their initial therapy in
the neoadjuvant setting, 17 in the adjuvant setting,
and 22 as therapy for metastatic disease. Seventeen
(40%) patients had received chemotherapy including
a taxane as part of their initial therapy.
The median number of BMS-247550 cycles
administered for the entire group was 3 (range, 1–8);
for patients who had previously received a taxanecontaining regimen the median number was 2
(range, 1–6), in contrast to 3.5 (range, 1–8) for
patients without previous taxane exposure. Additional patient characteristics including a breakdown
of known prognostic factors are listed in Table 1.17

Toxicity
Toxicity data were available for all 45 patients, of
whom 12 had a worst degree toxicity grade 4 or
higher. There was 1 treatment-related death secondary to a febrile neutropenic event. Clinically significant hematologic toxicity manifested primarily as
granulocytopenia. Sixteen patients experienced grade
3 or 4 granulocytopenia. However, only 4 patients
experienced neutropenic fever. Five patients had
grade 3 thrombocytopenia and 1 patient developed
grade 3 anemia. Clinically significant (grades 3 and
4) nonhematologic toxicity included 3 patients with
sensory neuropathy, 5 patients with grade 3 fatigue,

4 patients with grade 3 dehydration, and 1 each of
grade 3 renal failure, supraventricular arrhythmia,
and pneumonitis.

Response
Forty-two patients were assessable for response to
therapy, with 6 deemed unevaluable (2 died before
first evaluation, 4 others had incomplete baseline or
follow-up information). Five patients obtained an
objective partial response (PR) for an overall
response rate of 11.9% (90% confidence interval [CI],
5.3%, 26.5%). Three PRs were observed among
patients who had received prior taxane-based therapy. Forty-one patients have progressed or died. The
median progression-free survival was 2.7 months,
with 1- and 2-year estimates of 5% and 2%, respectively (Fig. 1). At the time of this report, 39 (93%)
patients have died. The median follow-up for the 3
remaining patients was 20 months. The median overall survival was 8 months, with 1- and 2-year estimates of 17% and 10%, respectively (Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
Although there has been only modest progress made
in the management of advanced urothelial cancer
over the past 15 years, a clinically relevant stage
migration has occurred, with patients by and large
having improved performance status at diagnosis. In
addition, evidence supporting a survival benefit from
the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy18,19 has significantly increased utilization of perioperative chemo-

therapy, in turn leading to an enlarging number of
patients with metastatic disease having already
received front-line chemotherapy. As a consequence,
there is an expanding, albeit still modest, number of
patients with advanced urothelial cancer fit enough
to receive second-line chemotherapy.
A number of phase 2 trials in the salvage setting
have been reported.4,7,9,20–22 Among the first trials to
evaluate a second line therapy was Witte et al.,7 who
conducted a cooperative group multicenter phase 2
trial evaluation of ifosfamide, demonstrating a
response rate of 20%, with 5 patients obtaining complete response. The toxicity associated with this therapy was not insignificant, with myelosuppression
and renal toxicity being problematic. McCaffrey
et al.4 treated 30 patients with residual or progressive
disease after cisplatin-based combination therapy
with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 administered on a 3week schedule. Four (13%) patients achieved a partial response. Sternberg et al.21 treated 41 patients
who had previously been treated with cisplatin-based
regimens (primarily M-VAC) with gemcitabine and
paclitaxel and observed an impressive 60% response
rate, with 11 patients achieving a complete response.
The median survival in this experience was 14.4
months. Of note, 63% of the patients enrolled had
received their initial chemotherapy in either the
neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings.
Response rates in phase 2 trials of advanced
bladder cancer can be significantly influenced by
patient selection, as described by Bajorin et al.17 In
the salvage setting other factors in addition to those
described by Bajorin et al. will likely influence
response rates, including the time to disease progression, the drugs initially received, and the setting of
initial chemotherapy, ie, adjuvant/neoadjuvant vs
therapy for metastatic disease. Despite variable
objective response rates demonstrated in many

phase 2 trials of cytotoxics in the salvage setting, the
therapeutic goal of treatment in this setting remains
palliation of disease-related symptoms, given the
lack of evidence that therapy impacts either diseasefree or overall survival.
Given the modest activity of BMS-247550 (ixabepilone) noted in this phase 2 trial, the degree of significant myelosuppression including 1 patient death
secondary to neutropenic sepsis is problematic.
Investigators from the Southwest Oncology Group
conducted a phase 2 trial of the same dose and
schedule of BMS-247550 (ixabepilone) in 42 chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced prostate cancer. Although interesting antitumor activity was
observed, grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in
16 and 3 patients, respectively. All grade 4 toxicities
were neutropenia or leukopenia.23
In summary, in this clinical setting, BMS-247550
(ixabepilone) has very modest activity at the expense
of moderate toxicity, primarily myelosuppression.
Further development of this agent in urothelial cancer seems unwarranted.
