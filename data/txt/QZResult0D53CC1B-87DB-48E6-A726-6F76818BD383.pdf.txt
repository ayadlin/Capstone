ABSTRACT
Survival of activated B cell-subtype (ABC) of diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) is driven by chronic B cell receptor (BCR) signaling that activates the
canonical NF-κB pathway. Inhibition of BTK by Ibrutinib has been shown to kill ABC
DLBCL cells that carry activating mutations in the BCR adaptor CD79. However,
mutations in BTK or in downstream components such as CARMA1/CARD11 can
render lymphomas Ibrutinib resistant. Therefore, we assessed here the simultaneous
inhibition of BTK and the protease MALT1 that acts downstream of CARMA1 and is
essential for ABC DLBCL tumor growth. We show that in CD79 mutant cells BTK is a
crucial upstream regulator of MALT1, but dispensable in CARMA1 mutant ABC DLBCL.
Combined inhibition of BTK by Ibrutinib and MALT1 by S-Mepazine additively impaired
MALT1 cleavage activity and expression of NF-κB pro-survival factors. Thereby,
combinatorial Ibrutinib and S-Mepazine treatment enhanced killing of CD79 mutant
ABC DLBCL cells. Moreover, while expression of oncogenic CARMA1 in CD79 mutant
cells conferred Ibrutinib resistance, double mutant cells were still sensitive to MALT1
inhibition by S-Mepazine. Thus, based on the genetic background combinatorial BTK
and MALT1 inhibition may improve effectiveness of therapeutic treatment and reduce
the chances for the development of drug resistances.

INTRODUCTION

(~10%) [4, 5]. Thus, small molecule targeting of the BCRNF-κB signaling axis represents a promising strategy to
treat this highly malignant lymphoma subtype.
The tyrosine kinase BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase) is a key enzyme for B lymphocyte activation by
linking proximal BCR signaling to various downstream
pathways including AKT, calcium release, MAP kinases
and NF-κB activation [6]. BTK is critical for survival
and proliferation of various B cell malignancies, such
as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell
lymphoma (MCL) [6-8]. Good overall response rates in
clinical trials have recently prompted FDA breakthrough
approval of the irreversible BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib (PCI32765) for the treatment of relapsed MCL and CLL [7, 9].
In addition, BTK is required for survival of CD79 mutated
ABC DLBCL cells where it primarily regulates canonical
NF-κB signaling [4, 10]. A first clinical trial demonstrated
partial or complete responses in relapsed/refractory ABC

Activated B cell-type (ABC) of diffuse-large B
cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents one of the most
aggressive lymphoma entities. The high incidence of
refractory and relapsed cases and the 3-year survival
rate of ~ 40 % reflect the critical need for more effective
therapeutic approaches. Survival of ABC DLBCL relies on
chronic activation of the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling
that drives activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway
[1, 2]. Congruently, inactivation of BCR components
or downstream signaling proteins by knock-down or
pharmacological inhibition is highly toxic to ABC DLBCL
[3, 4]. Further, somatic oncogenic mutations in signaling
mediators that connect BCR signaling to NF-κB are
frequent in ABC DLBCL patients. Activating mutations
are found in the BCR proximal adaptor CD79A or CD79B
(~21%) or in the scaffold protein CARMA1/CARD11

DLBCL patients that rely on chronic BCR signaling [11].
Overall, BTK inhibition by Ibrutinib monotherapy seems
to be able to control progression but is not not sufficient
to fully eradicate many lymphomas [12]. Further, the
appearance of Ibrutinib resistances in CLL and MCL
underscores that inhibition of BCR signaling by targeting
BTK alone may not be sufficient to achieve life-long
responses [13-15]
The protease MALT1 acts downstream of CARMA1
in pathological BCR signaling in ABC DLBCL [3].
Congruently, MALT1 proteolytic activity is constitutively
turned on in ABC DLBCL cells and promotes optimal
anti-apoptotic NF-κB activation [16, 17]. Two classes
of small molecule MALT1 inhibitors were recently
identified that showed good preclinical responses in ABC
DLBCL [18, 19]. With Mepazine and Thioridazine, two
first generation anti-psychotic drugs from the class of
phenothiazines have been identified as allosteric MALT1
inhibitors that kill selectively ABC DLBCL cells carrying
oncogenic CD79 or CARMA1 mutations [19]. Structureactivity analyses demonstrated that the S-enantiomer of
Mepazine is the most potent MALT1 inhibitor of this class
of compounds [20].
Here, we determined in how far BTK inhibition by
Ibrutinib is affecting MALT1 activity in ABC DLBCL
cells that carry oncogenic mutations in either CD79 or
CARMA1. By using defined ABC DLBCL cell lines, we
evaluated the advantages of combinatorial treatment with
the irreversible BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib and the allosteric
MALT1 inhibitor S-Mepazine.

using chemical activity-based probes (ABP) that
selectively label the active MALT1 in cellular extracts
[22]. Biotinylated MALT1-ABP was used to label active
MALT1 in ABC DLBCL cells and detection was done on
streptavidin-coated plates by an enzyme linked activitysorbent assay (ELASA) (Figure 1). A single treatment with
increasing concentrations of Ibrutinib (0.3-10 nM) for 18
h reduced MALT1 activity in a dose dependent manner
in CD79 mutant cells HBL1, OCI-Ly10 and TMD8 cells
(Figure 1A). However, MALT1 activity was not affected
in CARMA1 mutant OCI-Ly3 cells. In contrast, the
allosteric MALT1 inhibitor S-Mepazine inhibited MALT1
in all ABC DLBCL cell lines at concentrations between
0.3-10 µM (Figure 1B). To test combinatorial effects,
we incubated the cells with 0.5 nM Ibrutinib to achieve
approximately 50 - 60% reduction of MALT1 activity and
added increasing concentrations of S-Mepazine (Figure
1C). Combinatorial treatment of Ibrutinib and S-Mepazine
augmented MALT1 inhibition in Ibrutinib responsive
cells. Clearly, co-administration of Ibrutinib (0.5 nM) and
S-Mepazine (3 µM) resulted in a significant reduction of
MALT1 activity when compared to single agent treatment
in CD79B or CD79A mutant HBL1, TMD8 or OCI-Ly10
cells, but not in Ibrutinib resistant CARMA1 mutant OCILy3 cells (Figure 1D).
We asked if decreased MALT1 activity also
coincides with a reduction of MALT1 substrate cleavage.
For this, ABC DLBCL cells were incubated with Ibrutinib
(5 nM) and S-Mepazine (10 µM) and cleavage of the
MALT1 substrates RelB and BCL10 was detected by
Western Blot (Figure 2A). Both inhibitors prevented RelB
and BCL10 cleavage in HBL1, TMD8 and OCI-Ly10
cells, but only the MALT1 inhibitor S-Mepazine was able
to effectively inhibited MALT1 substrate cleavage in OCILy3 cells. MALT1 cleaves BCL10 at the very C-terminus
and as observed in previous publications inhibition of
MALT1 promoted strong accumulation of full-length
BCL10 in ABC DLBCL cells [16, 17]. Accumulation
of full-length BCL10 upon MALT1 inhibition was best
detected with an antibody (EP606Y) directed against
the BCL10 C-terminus that does not recognize cleaved
BCL10∆ (Figure 2A). Next, ABC DLBCL cells were
incubated in the presence of Ibrutinib (0.5-5 nM)
and MALT1 inhibition was monitored by detecting
accumulation of uncleaved BCL10 and decline of the
RelB cleavage product (RelB∆) (Figure 2B). Congruent
with the direct effects on MALT1 activity, BTK inhibition
by Ibrutinib inhibited cellular substrate cleavage only in
HBL1, TMD8 and OCI-Ly10 cells in a dose dependent
manner. S-Mepazine was effectively inhibiting RelB and
BCL10 cleavage in all cells independent of the oncogenic
event at concentrations between 0.5-10 µM (Figure 2C).
We assessed combinatorial effects on MALT1 substrate
cleavage and we chose BCL10 accumulation, because
the increase in the uncleaved form can be reliably
monitored in all cells (see Figure 2A). Cells were

DLBCL
To determine responses to Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)
alone as well as Ibrutinib/S-Mepazine co-treatment
on ABC DLBCL cells, we used a set of four wellcharacterized cell lines with distinct genetic lesions in the
BCR signaling pathway. Whereas OCI-Ly3 cells express
an oncogenic CARMA1 coiled-coil mutant (L244P)
[5], HBL1, TMD8 and OCI-Ly10 cells carry upstream
activating mutations in the ITAMs of the BCR adaptors
CD79B (Y196F/HBL1 and Y196H/TMD8) or CD79A
(∆191-208/OCI-Ly10) [4]. The very frequent MYD88
mutation L265P is present in all four DLBCL cell lines
[21]. Whereas all cells are characterized by constitutive
MALT1 activity, only CD79 mutant cells require BTK
expression [4, 16, 17].
We first determined if inhibition of BTK activity
by Ibrutinib affects activity of the downstream protease
MALT1. For this, we directly measured MALT1 activity

combinatorial treatment led to augmented inhibition of

MALT1-dependent BCL10 cleavage in HBL1, OCI-Ly10
and TMD8 cells, but not in OCI-Ly3 cells (Figure 2D).
Taken together, the data show that combination of BTK

OCI-Ly3. D. Combinatorial treatment of Ibrutinib and S-Mepazine significantly reduced MALT1 activity. MALT1 activity in response to

independent experiments ± SD. Significance was calculated by Student’s t-test (*p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.01; ***p ≤ 0.001).

the S-Mepazine triggered decreases of BCLxL and c-FLIP
in CARMA1 mutant OCI-Ly3 cells.
NF-κB-dependent gene expression of IL-6 and IL10 is important for ABC DLBCL cells, because they act on
the cell survival and growth in an autocrine fashion [21].
We determined IL-10 secretion after Ibrutinib treatment
in HBL1, TMD8, OCI-Ly10, and OCI-Ly3 cells (Figure
3C). Strong IL-6 expression was only detected in the ABC
DLBCL cell lines TMD8 and OCI-Ly3 [19] and therefore
we also determined the impact of Ibrutinib on IL-6 in
these two cells (Figure 3D). Again, Ibrutinib was only able
to impair IL-6 or IL-10 expression in ABC DLBCL cells
that express CD79 mutants, but not in CARMA1 L244P
expressing OCI-Ly3 cells. In contrast, S-Mepazine alone
was able to suppress IL-6 and IL-10 expression in all ABC
DLBCL cell lines, but the combination of both BTK and
MALT1 inhibitors was severely augmenting the inhibitory
effects on production of both interleukins in CD79
mutant ABC DLBCL cells (Figure 3E and 3F). Thus, the
combination of BTK and MALT1 inhibitors apparently
additively increases the efficacy over single agent
treatment to suppress expression of NF-κB dependent prosurvival proteins in ABC DLBCL cells.

Augmented depletion of NF-κB dependent
survival factors in CD79 mutant cells by BTK and
MALT1 inhibition
The survival of ABC DLBCL cells is strongly
dependent on constitutive NF-κB activation that promotes
protection from apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic proteins
BCLXL and c-FLIP are induced via NF-κB-dependent gene
expression and are required to maintain survival of ABC
DLBCL cells. To measure the effects of combinatorial
S-Mepazine and Ibrutinib application we detected
BCLXL and c-FLIP proteins in HBL1, TMD8 and OCILy3 cells (Figure 3A and 3B). Upon Ibrutinib treatment
alone, BCLXL and c-FLIP amounts were reduced in HBL1
and TMD8 cells, but not in OCI-Ly3 cells (Figure 3A).
S-Mepazine caused reduced expression of both survival
factors in all three ABC DLBCL cells (Figure 3B).
Whereas a combination of both compounds resulted in
an additive reduction of both proteins in CD79 mutant
HBL1 and TMD8 cells, Ibrutinib did not further reduce

further increased by the parallel incubation of Ibrutinib
and S-Mepazine in CD79 mutant cells. Again, Ibrutinib
was not further augmenting toxicity of S-Mepazine in
OCI-Ly3 cells.
We also determined induction of apoptosis in HBL1,
TMD8, OCI-Ly10 and OCI-Ly3 cells by determining
AnnexinV positive cells 3 days after single agent or
combinatorial treatment (Figure 4B). Whereas Ibrutinib
(1 nM) and S-Mepazine (10 µM) alone weakly induced
apoptosis in Großrutinib sensitive ABC DLBCL cells,
the combination of both drugs significantly enhanced
apoptosis when compared to single agent treatment. As

not toxic to OCI-Ly3 cells, but led to a dose dependent
decline of viable cells in all other ABC DLBCL cell lines.

S-Mepazine administration, but the cells did not react
to Ibrutinib treatment. Thus, the data underscore that
combination of BTK and MALT1 inhibitors can enhance
toxicity in CD79 mutant ABC DLBCL cells.
Binding to phenothiazines is impaired by the
mutation E397A in the allosteric binding site of MALT1
[20]. Congruently, we have been able to show that
expression of MALT1 E397A rendered HBL1 cells
resistant to MALT1 inhibitor treatment, verifying that
Mepazine is exerting toxic effects by acting on MALT1
[20]. Despite the fact that OCI-Ly3 cells that carry
oncogenic CARMA1 mutation are resistant to Ibrutinib
treatment, we wanted to verify that indeed the oncogenic
status of the ABC DLBCL cells independent of their
origin determines drug sensitivity. For this, we expressed
the activating CARMA1 mutant L225LI in HBL1 cells
to potentially render the cells independent of BCR
upstream signaling [5]. HBL1 cells were transduced
with high efficiency (>95%) upon lentiviral infection as
evident from co-expression of the surface marker ∆CD2
(Figure 5A). Strep-Flag-CARMA1 L225LI was expressed
approximately at endogenous levels of CARMA1 in
HBL1 cells. We determined effects of BTK and MALT1
inhibition by measuring IL-10 production (Figure 5B). IL10 amounts in mock infected HBL1 cells were decreased
after Ibrutinib and S-Mepazine treatment either alone
or in combination. Expression of oncogenic CARMA1
L225LI further boosted IL-10 secretion. Despite the
strong induction, IL-10 expression in CARMA1 L225LI
HBL1 cells was still severely reduced by MALT1 inhibitor
S-Mepazine, but much more resistant to incubation of the
BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib.
Finally, we compared toxic effects of Ibrutinib and
S-Mepazine in mock and CARMA1 L225LI expressing
HBL1 cells (Figure 5C). Whereas mock and CARMA1
L225LI infected cells were still sensitive to MALT1
inhibitor S-Mepazine, CARMA1 L225LI conferred
resistance to BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib. Additionally,
CARMA1 L225LI abolished augmented killing by
combinatorial treatment of Ibrutinib and S-Mepazine.
Thus, the data demonstrate that sensitivity to the
compounds as well as combinatorial treatment is indeed
relying on the oncogenic background of the DLBCL cells.

resistances in CLL and MCL stressed the limitations
of BTK monotherapy [13, 15]. Especially the frequent
BTK mutation C481S that hinders binding of Ibrutinib is
leading to relapse in many lymphoma patients. Recently,
a phase 1/2 clinical trial demonstrated that Ibrutinib
produces partial or complete responses in ABC DLBCL
patients that rely on chronic BCR signaling, but is
ineffective in patients carrying activating CARMA1/
CARD11 mutations [11]. Even though so far no BTK
resistant mutations have been described in ABC DLBCL,
clinical responses are apparently not long-lasting, stressing
the necessity to develop drug combinations (reviewed in
[12]). Our results suggest that combinatorial BTK and
MALT1 inhibitor treatment may enhance efficacy, but can
also reduce the chances of resistances that are acquired
either by mutations of the drug targets or indirectly in
downstream components such as CARMA1.
Previous studies have largely focused on combining
BTK inhibitors with inhibitors and candidate drugs that
target parallel oncogenic pathways. In ABC DLBCL
cells, high degree of cooperativity has been reported
for combining Ibrutinib with inhibitors targeting the
parallel SYK-PI3K-AKT-mTORC pathway that emanates
upstream from BTK [4, 23, 24]. Synergistic effects were
also obtained by combining BTK with either BCL2
inhibitors that enhance apoptosis or lenalidomide that
increases toxic interferon responses in ABC DLBCL [10,
24]. Even though compounds targeting parallel oncogenic
pathways exert a strong synergistic response together with
Ibrutinib, this approach may not be sufficient to prevent
the development of Ibrutinib resistances by BTK or
downstream mutations. Therefore, we took an alternative
approach and explored the combinatorial application of
the irreversible BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib with the allosteric
MALT1 inhibitor S-Mepazine, because both compounds
act at different stages of the pathological BCR-NF-κB
signaling axis. Indeed, by correlating inhibitor sensitivity
to oncogenic alterations in well-defined cell lines we could
confirm that BTK is an upstream regulator of MALT1
activity in CD79 mutant, but not in CARMA1 mutant
DLBCL cells. In contrast, MALT1 inhibitor S-Mepazine
was still effective in CARMA1 mutant DLBCL that are
resistant to Ibrutinib. In cells that were sensitive to BTK
inhibition, the combination of both inhibitors resulted
in augmented MALT1 inhibition and concomitantly
decreased expression of BCR-NF-κB regulated proteins
and induced toxicity at lower concentrations of the
individual compounds. Specificity of the inhibitors was
confirmed by expressing oncogenic CARMA1 L225LI or
S-Mepazine binding mutant MALT1 E397A that confers
resistance to BTK or MALT1 inhibition, respectively [20].
In contrast to the synergistic effects observed for
instance by the combination of BTK and PI3K-AKT
inhibitors [24], BTK and MALT1 co-treatment yielded
additive effects on MALT1 activity and killing of
CD79 mutant ABC DLBCL cells. It confirms that both

Resistance mechanisms are a major obstacle for
precision therapy and target directed approaches for

different drugs that target cancer at various stages of
one or more oncogenic pathways are thought to reduce
the chances of drug resistance over single agent therapy.

inhibitors are primarily targeting pathological BCR-NFκB signaling. Nevertheless, inhibiting different steps of
the same oncogenic pathway may enhance efficacy of
treatment and significantly reduce the chances to develop
Ibrutinib resistances compared to single agent therapy. In
addition, lowering the doses of individual pharmaceuticals
may decrease toxic adverse effects, as some side effects
have already been observed in clinical trials with Ibrutinib
[25]. Phenothiazines like Thioridazine or Mepazine
have been used since the 1950ies to treat anti-psychotic
disorders. Thioridazine is still an approved drug opening
up the option of drug repositioning and repurposing
trials in relapsed/refractory ABC DLBCL potentially in
combination with Ibrutinib. By enhancing lymphoma
killing and preventing the development of resistances,
combinatorial regimes may result in more long-lasting
responses and hopefully avoid the necessity for lifelong
treatment with the inhibitors. Furthermore, BTK inhibition
was also shown to impact on CARMA1-NF-κB signaling
in a subset of MCLs [26]. It will be interesting to unravel
whether MALT1 may be active in other Ibrutinib sensitive
lymphomas such as CLL or MCL and to determine
whether combinatorial BTK and MALT1 inhibition may
potentially hold benefits for lymphoma patients beyond
ABC DLBCL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Activity of MALT1 was determined as described
earlier [22]. To this end DLBCL cell lines (5 x 105/ml
per sample) were treated with different concentrations
of Ibrutinib and S-Mepazine for 18 h and lysed in 130
µl co-IP buffer (25 mM hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol, 0.2% NP-40, 1mM DTT, 10 mM sodium
fluoride, 8 mM β-glycerophosphate and 300 μM sodium
vanadate) w/o protease inhibitors. After centrifugation
and removal of 10 µl input control, extract was incubated
with 0.1 µM biotinylated ABP (activity-based probe)
at RT for 1 h to form active MALT1-ABP complexes.
Extract was transferred to streptavidin-coated plates
(Thermo Scientific) and incubated o/n at 4 °C. Plates
were washed with PBS-T (0.05% Tween), blocked with
2% BSA and incubated with primary MALT1 antibody
(2494; Cell Signaling) for 1h at RT. After further washing,
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were added
for 1 h, washed and TMB substrate was incubated for
approximately 15 min. Reaction was stopped with 1M
H2PO4 and luminescence was analyzed in a Biotek reader
at 450 nm (background 570 nm).

Lentiviral transduction
For lentiviral infection of HBL1 cells with the
construct for CARMA1 L225LI HEK293T cells were
transfected each with pMD2.G and psPAX2 lentiviral
packaging plasmids using X-tremeGENE HP Transfection
Reagent (Roche). As a transfer vector we used 2 µg of a
pHAGE construct containing h∆CD2 followed by the T2A
and CARMA1 L225LI sequence. After 3 days the virus
was concentrated in Amicon ultra 100K Centrifugal filters
(Millipore). 200 000 HBL1 cells were transduced via
spin infection for 1 h and 720 g at room temperature. For
increased efficiency of infection we added Polybrene to a
concentratin of 8 µg/ml followed by incubation overnight.
Infection rates of HBL1 cells were monitored by anti
h∆CD2-APC (eBioscience) staining in flow cytometry.

MALT1 ELASA (enzyme-linked activity-sorbent
assay)

Cell culture and reagents
DLBCL cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 % FBS
and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. OCI-Ly10 cell
line was cultured in IMDM medium (Invitrogen) with
20 % human plasma, penicillin/streptomycin and 50
µM β-mercaptoethanol. Jurkat T cells were cultured
like DLBCL cells with 10 % FCS. S-Mepazine HCl
(Kalexsyn) and Ibrutinib (Selleck Chem) were solved
in DMSO and used as indicated. For detection of RelB
cleavage fragment proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Merck;
10 µM) was incubated 1h prior to lysis. Antibodies for
Western Blot were BCL10 (Abcam EP606Y and Santa
Cruz H197), RelB (Cell signaling, C1E4), BCLXL (Cell
Signaling), MALT1 (H300, Santa Cruz), c-FLIP (Alexis
Biochemicals) and β-Actin (I-19, Santa Cruz). IL-6 and
IL-10 ELISAs (Immunotools) were performed according
to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Lentiviral transduction vectors pMD2.G (Addgene
plasmid # 12259) and psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid #
12260) were a gift from Didier Trono.

Viability of DLBCL cell lines was analyzed using
a Vi-Cell cell counter (Beckman Coulter) after four days
of S-Mepazine and/or Ibrutinib treatment in comparison
to DMSO-treated cells. Apoptosis rates of the cells
