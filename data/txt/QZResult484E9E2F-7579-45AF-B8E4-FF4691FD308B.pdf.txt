BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation drives acquired drug resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. However, it was reported that this mutation may exist before drug
exposure. The objective of the current study was to evaluate whether the clinical outcomes are affected by the percentage of preexisting T790M mutations within a tumor. METHODS: Pretreatment tissues were collected from 124 patients with advanced non-small
cell lung cancer with sensitizing EGFR mutations that were detected by direct sequencing. Genotyping for EGFR T790M mutation
was further performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Patients who were positive
for the T790M mutation were divided to 2 subgroups according to T790M mutant signal frequency. RESULTS: The T790M mutation
was found in 31 patients (25.0%). The T790M mutation frequency at which the risk of disease progression after therapy with EGFRTKIs begins to increase was estimated to be 3.2%. The patients with T790M-positive tumors had a shorter time to disease progression
after treatment with EGFR-TKIs (median, 6.3 months vs 11.5 months; P <.001) and overall survival (median, 16.1 months vs 26.5 months;
P 5.065) compared with those with T790M-negative tumors. Among the T790M-positive patients, the patients with high T790M frequency (9 patients) were found to have a shorter time to disease progression (median, 2.4 months vs 6.7 months; P 5.009) and overall survival (median, 9.1 months vs 18.7 months; P 5.018) compared with those with low T790M frequency (22 patients).
CONCLUSIONS: A preexisting EGFR T790M mutation was noted in 25% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Patients with a
high T790M mutation frequency had worse clinical outcomes to EGFR-TKIs than patients with a low T790M mutation frequency.

INTRODUCTION
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are clinically effective in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations.1 However, the majority of the patients with
EGFR-mutant lung cancer who initially benefit from EGFR-TKI therapy eventually acquire resistance to the drug and experience disease progression. The T790M gatekeeper mutation in the EGFR gene is regarded as the most common cause
of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.2,3 This mutation causes substitution of threonine to methionine at codon 790 in
the catalytic domain of EGFR. This substitution increases the receptor’s affinity for adenosine triphosphate and impairs
receptor-drug binding by inhibiting hydrogen bond formation or inducing steric hindrance.2,4 This T790M resistant
mutation was found in approximately 60% of rebiopsy samples obtained from patients with acquired resistance to EGFRTKI therapy.5

De Novo EGFR T790M Mutations Frequency/Lee et al

A subset of patients with sensitive EGFR mutations
did not respond to EGFR-TKI therapy or their response
was shorter than expected.6-8 To the best of our knowledge, the cause of this reduction in the efficacy of targeted
therapy in a molecularly defined patient population
remains unknown. Recently, some case reports and preclinical studies have suggested that the T790M resistance
mutation may exist before EGFR-TKI exposure and may
play a fundamental role in the inherent resistance of
EGFR-mutant tumors to EGFR-TKI therapy.9,10 Based
on these findings, it was assumed that some subclones
with this resistant mutation are present before the initiation of EGFR-TKI therapy, albeit at a low frequency, and
selective pressure from EGFR-TKI therapy may therefore
cause the expansion of these latent resistant subclones,
resulting in the emergence of a resistant phenotype in the
entire population of cells.
Several studies have tried to prove the presence of
preexisting T790M mutations in patients with EGFRmutant lung cancer using genotyping methods that are
more sensitive than the commonly used direct sequencing
method, which is usually unable to detect low-frequency
mutations.11-16 However, the frequency of preexisting
T790M mutations reported in prior studies ranged from
2% to 80%.11-16 For example, the IRESSA Pan-Asia
Study, which used an amplification mutation refractory
system as a method of EGFR mutation analysis, detected
preexisting T790M mutations in 11 of 261 patients with
EGFR mutations (4.2%) whereas the EURTAC study
(European Randomised Trial of Tarceva vs. Chemotherapy), which used TaqMan assay in the presence of a peptide nucleic acid clamp, detected the mutation in 47 of
123 patients (38.2%).15,16 More recently, Su et al provided data regarding the T790M mutation frequency by
using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) method as a
validation test.13 In that study, the investigators compared
mass spectrometry (MS) genotyping assays with standard
direct sequencing in terms of the ability to detect T790M
mutations present at a low frequency in tissue samples
obtained before and after EGFR-TKI therapy. The MS
genotyping method had a detection sensitivity of 1.5%
for T790M mutant alleles and identified more T790M
mutations than did the direct sequencing method in pretreatment (31.5% vs 2.7%) and posttreatment (83.3% vs
33.3%) samples, which was confirmed by NGS. The
authors also reported that patients with the EGFR T790M
mutation demonstrated inferior outcomes during EGFRTKI compared with patients without this mutation.
Although these prior studies suggested the preexistence of resistant clones in patients with EGFR-mutant
Cancer

lung cancer, to our knowledge there were no data regarding the percentage of these resistant clones within each tumor or the clinical outcomes according to the percentage
of these clones. Thus, the objectives of the current study
were as follows: 1) to determine the frequency of preexisting EGFR T790M mutations in Korean patients with
advanced NSCLC harboring sensitive EGFR mutations;
2) to evaluate the clinical outcomes according to the level
of the T790M mutation; and 3) to estimate the minimum
frequency of the T790M mutation within a tumor at
which point it begins to negatively influence the efficacy
of EGFR-TKIs. In the current study, the EGFR T790M
mutation frequency was determined using the MS genotyping assay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Tumor Samples

Patients with advanced NSCLC who underwent routine
direct sequencing of the EGFR gene and who were treated
with an EGFR-TKI (eg, gefitinib or erlotinib) at the
National Cancer Center Hospital (Goyang, Republic of
Korea) between January 2009 and August 2011 were
screened for the current study (see online supporting information). Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
pretreatment tumor tissues were collected for genetic analysis. A pathologist (K.G.L) reviewed hematoxylin and
eosin-stained sections of each tissue sample and identified
tissue areas containing  70% tumor for dissection.
Genomic DNA was extracted from the dissected tumor
tissue using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
Calif) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We
reviewed the patients’ medical records and radiographic
images to assess their characteristics, tumor response, and
survival outcomes. Tumor response was retrospectively
determined in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.17 The current study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the study institution and all patients provided
written informed consent.
Sequence Analysis

Direct sequencing of the EGFR gene was performed by
nested polymerase chain reaction amplification of the
individual exons (exons 18-21), as previously described.18
A deletion mutation in exon 19 and a point mutation
(CTG>CGG) in exon 21 (L858R) were considered sensitive EGFR mutations. Cases with the sensitive EGFR
mutations and a wild-type EGFR gene, were genotyped
further for the T790M mutation in exon 20. Genotyping
for the T790M mutation was performed using matrix2091

assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS
using the standard protocol of the MassARRAY System
(Sequenom, San Diego, Calif).
Sensitivity Analysis of the MS Assay

Serial DNA mixtures of mutant and wild-type DNA were
genotyped by the MS assay to determine the detection
limit and cutoff value for the T790M mutation (see
online supporting information). The T790M-mutant signal calls were detectable in the cluster plot and mass spectrum of the DNA mixtures with a T790M mutation
frequency of 2.5%. The mutant signal frequency was
calculated as follows: mutant signal frequency
(%) 5 (mutant peak height)/(mutant peak height 1 wildtype peak height) 3 100. The calculated mutant signal
frequency in the 2.5% T790M DNA mixture was 2.95%.
Thus, this value was used as the cutoff value for the
T790M mutation in further analysis. The diluted mutant
DNA percentage was linearly correlated with the mutant
signal frequency (R2 5 0.9878) (see online supporting
information).
In Vitro Experiments for Estimating the
Percentage of Resistant T790M Cells

In vitro sensitivity to gefitinib (LC Laboratories, Woburn,
Mass) was measured in 2 pairs of cell line mixtures containing TKI-sensitive cells and TKI-resistant cells with the
T790M mutation: HCC827/H1975 and PC9/PC9GRT790M.19 The HCC827, PC9, and H1975 cell lines
were purchased from Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul,
Korea), RIKEN BioResource Center cell bank (Ibaraki,
Japan), and American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va), respectively. The gefitinib-resistant PC9GRT790M cell line was generated by chronically exposing
PC9 cells to stepwise increasing concentrations of gefitinib and isolation, followed by characterization of a single
resistant clone in the study laboratory. TKI-sensitive cells
and TKI-resistant cells with the T790M mutation were
mixed at the indicated percentages and were treated with
gefitinib for 72 hours. Growth inhibition was measured
using the MTS assay (Promega, Madison, Wis) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and was
compared between groups using the log-rank test. The
Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for
univariate and multivariate survival analyses to determine
hazards ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI). Two-sided values of P < .05 were considered to be
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patients

A total of 173 patients (124 with sensitive EGFR mutations and 49 with wild-type EGFR gene) were further genotyped by the MS-based assay. Patients’ characteristics
were shown in Table 1. Survival data were followed until
the end of April 2013, and the median follow-up duration
was 35.6 months (range, 2.5 months-49.2 months). The
median progression-free survival and OS of EGFR-mutant patients were 9.4 months (95% CI, 6.7 months-12.1
months) and 23.5 months (95% CI, 17.4 months-29.6
months), respectively. However, the median progressionfree survival and OS of patients with wild-type EGFR
were 1.4 months (95% CI, 0.8 months-2.0 months) and
3.5 months (95% CI, 2.2 months-4.9 months),
respectively.
Frequency of the T790M Mutation

The tumor tissues were obtained by biopsy/aspiration
(n 5 135; 78.0%) or by surgical resection (n 5 38;
22.0%). Surgical specimens included 27 primary lung
tumors (15.6%) that were curatively resected at an early
stage of disease. The majority of tumor sites were the lung
and pleura (n 5 134; 77.5%). There was discordance
between tissue samples for genotyping and direct sequencing in 57 patients (32.9%). The MS-based genotyping
assay detected EGFR T790M mutations in 31 of 124
EGFR-mutant patients (25.0%) and in 3 of 49 patients
with wild-type EGFR (6.1%). Patient characteristics and
sampling methods did not differ between the patients
with T790M-positive tumors and those with T790Mnegative tumors (data not shown).

Statistical Analysis

Effects of the T790M Mutation on EGFR-TKI
Efficacy

Differences between pairs of categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Time
to disease progression (TTP) was measured from the first
day of therapy with EGFR-TKIs until the identification
of disease progression. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the first day of treatment with EGFR-TKIs
until death or the most recent follow-up. Survival time

The response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR) were
not significantly different between patients with T790Mpositive mutant tumors and T790M-negative mutant
tumors (RR, 71.0% vs 83.9% [P 5 .115]; DCR, 83.9% vs
92.5% [P 5 .173]). However, the median TTP was significantly shorter in patients with T790M-positive mutant
tumors compared with patients with T790M-negative

(Fig. 1A). Multivariate analysis of TTP demonstrated
that the risk of disease progression was significantly
higher in patients with T790M-positive mutant tumors
than in patients with T790M-negative mutant tumors
(HR, 2.43; 95% CI 1.55-3.80 [P < .001]) (see online

with T790M-positive mutant tumors was also observed
among the subgroup of patients treated with first-line
EGFR-TKIs (6.0 months vs 10.5 months; HR, 2.06;

Dose-Dependent Effect of the T790M Mutation

The optimal cutoff point of T790M mutant signal frequency that demonstrated the most significant HR of disease progression after therapy with EGFR-TKIs in
patients with T790M-positive mutant tumors was
45.7%, which corresponded to percentages of cells within
a tumor of 28.1% based on the cell line mixture study (see
online supporting information). Patients with T790Mpositive mutant tumors were divided into 2 subgroups
according to this cutoff value of T790M mutant signal
frequency. There was no significant difference noted with
regard to the RR and DCR between the groups with high
(n 5 9) and low (n 5 22) T790M mutant signal frequency (RR, 66.7% vs 72.7% [P 5 1.000]; DCR, 66.7%
vs 90.9% [P 5 .131]). However, the median TTP was
found to be significantly shorter in patients with high
T790M mutant signal frequency compared with those
with low T790M mutant signal frequency (2.4 months vs
6.7 months; HR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.26-6.75 [P 5 .009])
(Fig. 1E). In addition, the median OS was significantly
shorter in patients with high T790M mutant signal frequency compared with those with low T790M mutant
signal frequency (9.1 months vs 18.7 months; HR, 6.14;

Estimated Frequency of T790M Mutant Cells for
Inducing Resistance

A total of 124 patients with EGFR-mutant disease were
divided into 2 groups by the cutoff level defined as the
median value of deciles of the T790M mutant signal frequency. The trends in HRs for TTP during EGFR-TKI
therapy according to the cutoff levels of the T790M signal
frequency are shown in the online supporting information. The minimum cutoff level of the T790M signal at
which the risk of disease progression significantly
increased during EGFR-TKI therapy was 5.3%, which
corresponds to 3.2% of the estimated percentage (Fig. 2).
In vitro sensitivity to gefitinib was found to be significantly lower in the cell mixtures containing  10% H1975
cells (TKI-resistant cells) compared with that of pure H827
cells (TKI-sensitive cells) (Figs. 3A and 3B). In addition, in
mixtures of PC9GR-T790M cells and PC9 cells, the minimum percentage of PC9GR-T790M cells that started to
demonstrate a reduction in gefitinib sensitivity relative to
pure PC9 cells was 5% (Figs. 3C and 3D).
DISCUSSION
The current study semiquantitatively measured preexisting EGFR T790M mutations using the MS-based genotyping assay and evaluated the clinical significance of its
level in patients with advanced NSCLC with sensitive
EGFR mutations. The detection sensitivity for the
T790M mutation in the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS assay used in the current study was 2.5%, and a preexisting T790M
mutation was found in 25.0% of patients with EGFRmutant tumors in whom this mutation was not detected
by direct sequencing. The sensitivity and frequency of
the T790M mutation observed in the current study are
not different from those reported in the Taiwanese
study that used the same genotyping method.13 These
results suggest that the preexistence of resistant subclones before TKI exposure is not rare in tumors harboring TKI-sensitive mutations, but the latent resistant
subclones are not always detected by direct sequencing
methods because of their low frequency. Similar findings have been reported for other tumor types, including KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer.20,21 The latest
studies that used deep sequencing methods, either 454
pyrosequencing or BEAMing digital PCR, revealed that
Cancer

July 15, 2014

KRAS mutations mediate acquired resistance to antiEGFR treatment in KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer
and that these alterations exist as latent subclones within
the tumor before the initiation of therapy.20,21
As described above, advances in sequencing technology have provided direct evidence of intratumor genetic
heterogeneity, suggesting the preexistence of infrequent
resistant subclones. However, the impact of these resistant
subclones on clinical outcomes, including response and
resistance to therapy, remains to be elucidated. The results
of the current study revealed that the presence of latent resistant clones was associated with a reduced survival benefit from molecular targeted therapy. Although patients
with preexisting T790M mutations responded to EGFRTKI therapy, the duration of response was much shorter
than that of patients without the T790M mutation. In
particular, the clinical outcome of EGFR-TKI therapy
was worse in patients with high-level T790M mutations
compared with patients with low-level T790M mutations. Thus, the clinical outcome of patients with EGFRmutant tumors harboring a high percentage of the
T790M mutation was as poor as that for patients with
wild-type EGFR. These results suggest that the negative
impact of the T790M mutation on EGFR-TKI efficacy
may be dependent on the intratumoral percentage of the
T790M mutation.
In the current study, we used 2 different approaches
to determine the lowest frequency of the T790M mutation in patients with EGFR-mutant tumors that reduces
the efficacy of EGFR-TKI therapy. In both sets of cell line
mixtures, the mixtures containing 5% or 10% of T790M
cells demonstrated significantly decreased sensitivity to
gefitinib compared with the mixture without T790M
cells, whereas the mixtures containing < 5% or 10% of
T790M cells demonstrated no significant differences in
sensitivity to gefitinib compared with the mixture without
T790M cells. In clinical settings, the lowest frequency of
T790M cells to affect sensitivity to EGFR-TKI therapy
was estimated to be 3.2%. This discrepancy between the
clinical and cell line results may be explained by the difference in the composition of tumor DNA content between
the tissue samples and the cell lines. Although we selected
samples in which the tumor comprised 70% of the sample, the inclusion of nonmalignant normal cells, such as
stromal and inflammatory cells, possibly resulted in
underestimation of the lowest frequency of the T790M
mutation in tissue samples, unlike in tumor cell lines. It is
also possible that different numbers of the T790M allele
within each tumor cell could have contributed to the
discrepancy.

Figure 2. Hazard ratios for TTP following EGFR-TKI therapy
according to the cutoff levels of the T790M mutant signal frequency in 124 EGFR-mutant patients. Hazard ratios were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Based on the current analyses, the frequency of the
T790M mutation that is clinically significant but undetectable by direct sequencing appears to range from 5% to
20%. Thus, should we use more sensitive sequencing
methods, such as NGS, to detect preexisting T790M
mutations at this frequency range in daily practice? It is
still too early to consider NGS as the standard sequencing
method if this is the only goal. However, more sensitive
sequencing methods may be needed to detect lowfrequency gene mutations in clinical trials investigating
the efficacy of new anticancer drugs targeting EGFR
T790M mutation, or new treatment strategies designed to
overcome the limitations of first-generation EGFR-TKI
therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant tumors.
Of tumors acquiring secondary resistance to
EGFR-TKI therapy, those with EGFR T790M mutations generally demonstrate indolent growth and a
favorable prognosis compared with tumors without the
EGFR T790M mutation.22 However, it remains controversial whether tumors harboring a T790M mutation
before EGFR-TKI therapy are as indolent as tumors
acquiring a T790M mutation after EGFR-TKI therapy.
In a retrospective analysis of the EURTAC trial, which
compared the efficacy of erlotinib versus chemotherapy
in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer, the median
OS of patients with a preexisting T790M mutation was
found to be superior to that of patients without a preexisting T790M mutation in both treatment groups.16
However, in the study by Su et al, there was no difference in survival noted between patients with or without
the T790M mutation.13 In contrast to prior studies, the
2096

current study revealed that patients with T790Mnegative tumors had inferior survivals compared with
patients with T790M-positive tumors. It is likely that
the shorter OS of patients harboring the T790M mutation was attributed to their shorter TTP while receiving
EGFR-TKI therapy, considering the post-TKI survival
time was not significantly different between the 2
groups. Thus, it is difficult to reach definitive conclusions regarding whether tumors harboring preexisting
T790M mutations have more indolent progression than
tumors without preexisting T790M mutations.
There are several concerns to bear in mind when
interpreting the results of the current study. First, why did
prior direct sequencing not detect T790M mutations in
tumors in which the MS-based genotyping assay detected
a high frequency of T790M mutations? One explanation
may involve tumor heterogeneity and sampling differences in terms of site, timing, and methods. Of 10 tumors in
which the estimated T790M frequency was greater than
the detection limit of the direct sequencing method, only
2 tumors demonstrated concordance between 2 detection
methods in terms of sampling site, timing, and methods.
Second, several case reports have presented T790M as a
germline mutation from patients with lung cancer who
had a family history.23-25 In the current study, it was difficult to confirm whether a total of preexisting T790M
mutations are somatic mutations because we did not conduct mutational analysis of paired nontumor samples.
However, the detection of germline T790M mutations
was found to be highly unlikely when considering that
any patient with a T790M mutation did not have a family
history of lung cancer. In addition, if the T790M mutation is present as a germline mutation, T790M should be
present in 100% of the cells. The finding that T790M was
detected in only a fraction of tumor DNA means there
was no case of germline mutation in the current study
population.
Several treatments have been developed to overcome
the limitations of the first-generation EGFR-TKIs in
patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer and several
T790M-specific TKIs are currently being evaluated in
clinical trials. Thus, it is important that we understand the
clinical significance of the T790M mutation as the major
cause of resistance to EGFR-TKIs. The results of the current study revealed that the presence of a preexisting
T790M mutation is not a rare event and the frequency of
the T790M mutation within a tumor has a critical effect
on the tumor’s biological characteristics and the clinical
outcomes of EGFR-TKI therapy. The extent of preexisting EGFR T790M mutations is a challenging target for
