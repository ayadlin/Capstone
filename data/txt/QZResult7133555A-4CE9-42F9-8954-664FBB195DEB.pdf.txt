ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic, is a commonly used anticancer drug.
In spite of its widespread usage, its therapeutic effect is limited by its cardiotoxicity.
On the cellular level, Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity manifests as stress induced
premature senescence. Previously, we demonstrated that plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a potent inhibitor of serine proteases, is an important biomarker
and regulator of cellular senescence and aging. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
pharmacological inhibition of cellular PAI-1 protects against stress- and aging-induced
cellular senescence and delineated the molecular basis of protective action of PAI1 inhibition. Results show that TM5441, a potent small molecule inhibitor of PAI-1,
effectively prevents Doxorubicin-induced senescence in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts
and endothelial cells. TM5441 exerts its inhibitory effect on Doxorubicin-induced
cellular senescence by decreasing reactive oxygen species generation, induction of
antioxidants like catalase and suppression of stress-induced senescence cadre p53,
p21, p16, PAI-1 and IGFBP3. Importantly, TM5441 also reduces replicative senescence
of fibroblasts. Together these results for the first time demonstrate the efficacy of
PAI-1 inhibitor in prevention of Doxorubicin-induced and replicative senescence in
normal cells. Thus PAI-1 inhibitor may form an important adjuvant component of
chemotherapy regimens, limiting not only Doxorubicin-induced cardiac senescence
but also ameliorating the prothrombotic profile.

INTRODUCTION

associated secretory phenotype (SASP) or senescence
messaging secretome (SMS) [1, 2]. The SASP plays a
vital role in modulation of gene expression pattern that
is different from proliferating and quiescent cells and
contributes to stimulation and maintenance of senescence
features [1, 5]. Through progressive cellular division, the
telomere length ultimately shortens leading to cellular
growth arrest and replicative senescence. However, cells
may undergo senescence prematurely due to exposure
to a variety of stresses or insults which is known as
stress-activated or induced senescence [1, 2, 5, 6]. The
consequences of senescence in biological processes are
both beneficial and detrimental because while senescence
of highly mitotic preneoplastic cells is desirable,
premature senescence of normal cells is associated with
unwanted accelerated aging processes and adverse side-

Senescence is a cellular process by which cells
stop proliferation irreversibly and undergo morphological
changes due to expression of high levels of cell cycle
inhibitors and sub-set of genes whose products are
involved in senescence [1, 2]. In contrast, due to contact
inhibition cultured normal cells in confluency undergo
reversible growth arrest. Geroconversion, a cellular and
molecular process of conversion of reversible growth
arrest to irreversible growth arrest, leads to senescence
[3, 4]. Although senescent cells are not proliferating or
quiescent, they are metabolically active and synthesize
different pools of cytokines, growth factors and other
regulatory enzymes including IL-6, IL8, IGFBP3, TNFα,
PAI-1, TGF-β etc. and collectively known as senescencewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects in patients treated with oxidative stressors like
Doxorubicin. Senescence can also be induced in cultured
cells using a wide variety of senescence-inducing stimuli
including culture shock stress, high serum-induced cellular
stress, H2O2 and anticancer-drug-induced stresses. Most
of these stresses contribute to generate reactive oxygen
species (ROS), leading to telomere erosion and DNA
damage [1, 2, 5, 6]. Therefore, cells in culture provide an
excellent in vitro model for cellular senescence study and
to delineate its molecular basis.
Although common senescence markers or
regulators play a key role in stress-induced and replicative
senescence, not all major senescence markers are
expressed in every cell type undergoing senescence
[1, 2, 5-7]. A recent study on gene expression profiling
of replicative and different stress-induced senescence
suggests that major markers and regulators of senescence
are common in both replicative and stress-induced
senescent cells [7]. The key features of senescent cells
are: irreversible growth arrest, flattened morphology,
senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase
(SA-β-gal)
expression, elevated expression of cell cycle inhibitors
like p16, p21 and p53, growth factor TGF-β, growth
factor binding protein IGFBP3 and serine protease
inhibitor PAI-1 [8-11]. We and others have established
the significant role of PAI-1 in stress and aging-associated
cellular senescence as well as in development of numerous
human diseases including cardiovascular and renal
diseases [8-17]. The present study was undertaken to test
the hypothesis that pharmacological inhibition of PAI1 activity may protect normal cells from stress-induced
and aging-associated cellular senescence. We were also
interested in delineating the involvement of different
senescence regulators in three major cell types and mode
of action of PAI-1 inhibitor in these pathways.
In order to test our hypothesis we investigated the
role of a small molecule inhibitor of PAI-1, TM5441 in
different stress activated cellular senescence processes
with special emphasis on Doxorubicin. Doxorubicin
or Adriamycin belongs to anthracycline family of
antibiotics. It has been an important component of various
tumor therapies including leukemias, osteosarcomas
and mesotheliomas as it negatively affects the activity
of topoisomerases by intercalating between the base
sequences of DNA [18, 19]. However, the major drawback
of this drug is its cardiotoxic side effects that lead to
cardiomyopathy characterized by abnormal heart function
and development of cardiac fibrosis. Doxorubicin induces
cellular senescence and eventually drives the cells to
the death pathway [18-21]. It is known that PAI-1 is an
important regulator of cellular senescence and importantly
PAI-1 is induced by Doxorubicin in vitro in cultured cells
and in cancer patients undergoing Doxorubicin treatment
[11, 20]. These important findings lead us to test the
hypothesis that pharmacological inhibition of cellular
PAI-1 activity using a specific inhibitor protects cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from doxorubicin-induced senescence, and its associated
complications.
In the present study, we tested the efficacy of a
small molecule TM5441, a potent inhibitor of PAI-1,
in prevention of stress and aging associated cellular
senescence using different cell types. Our results suggest
that TM5441 has protective effect on stress-induced and
aging-induced cellular senescence via upregulation of
ROS quenchers like antioxidant catalase and suppression
of senescence regulators p16-p21-p53-PAI-1 and IGFBP3
signaling pathways. Therefore, PAI-1 is a druggable target
and pharmacological inhibition of elevated PAI-1 levels
may protect healthy cells from stress-induced premature
senescence and accelerated aging process.

RESULTS
TM5441 inhibits Doxorubicin-induced cellular
senescence characterized by morphology and SAβ-gal assay
We have tested the effect of a novel small molecule
PAI-1 inhibitor, TM5441, on Doxorubicin-induced cellular
senescence in three major cell types. Doxorubicin is a
chemotherapeutic agent that induces cellular senescence
via inhibition of Topoisomerase II and DNA damage
[18-21]. Cultured cells (cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and
endothelial cells) were pretreated with TM5441 for 1
day followed by treatment with Doxorubicin for 4 days.
Cellular senescence was confirmed by morphological
changes and or SA-β-gal assay in these cell types. PAI1 inhibitor TM5441-treated cells were morphologically
comparable to vehicle (DMSO) treated cells. Doxorubicin
treated endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes are
morphologically more flattened, a characteristic of
senescent cells. However, co-treatment with TM5441
reduces Doxorubicin-induced morphological changes
(Figure 1A-1D, upper panels). Mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) and mouse cardiac fibroblasts (MCFs)
are morphologically not distinct from control and treated
groups. SA-β-gal assay of control and treated groups
show that while Doxorubicin induces senescence in
endothelial cells and fibroblasts as evidenced by the
presence of significant number of SA-β-gal positive
cells, very few H9c2 cells are SA-β-gal positive under
the same experimental condition. Most importantly,
TM5441 pretreated cells are significantly protected from
Doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence as evidenced
by the decrease in SA-β-gal positive cells in cultures cotreated with Doxorubicin and TM5441 (Figure 1A-1D
lower panels; see also Supplemental Figure 1A-1D). The
levels of SA-β-gal positive cells in endothelial, fibroblast
and cardiomyocyte cultures treated with TM5441 alone
are comparable with that of vehicle DMSO treated cells.

To determine the effects of Doxorubicin and TM5441 on
cellular proliferation, cardiac fibroblasts were pretreated
with TM5441 followed by Doxorubicin treatment for
24 h. At the end of incubation, cellular proliferation
was assessed. Data reveal that Doxorubicin significantly
inhibits cellular proliferation and TM5441 partially blocks
Doxorubicin-induced inhibition of cellular proliferation

protective effect of TM5441, we next examined the
levels of senescence regulators in protein lysates prepared
from control, TM5441 alone, Doxorubicin alone and
Doxorubicin plus TM5441 treated cells by Western
blot. Data shows that Doxorubicin significantly induces
the levels of potent senescence inducers p53, IGFBP3,
PAI-1, p16 and p21 in human endothelial cells (Figure
2A). Most importantly, treatment with PAI-1 inhibitor
TM5441 inhibits the expression levels of p53, PAI-1,
p16, p21 and IGFBP3, the major regulators of cellular
senescence in endothelial cells. Our results show that
TM5441 mediated inhibition of Doxorubicin-induced
p53 is modest. Next we tested the effect of TM5441 on
Doxorubicin-induced senescence regulators p53 and PAI-1
at the transcript levels. Hence, consistent with the protein

data we observed that Doxorubicin significantly induces
PAI-1 mRNA in endothelial cells. While the Doxorubicinmediated induction of p53 mRNA and its suppression
by TM5441 are non-significant (p = 0.15), TM5441
significantly suppresses Doxorubicin-induced of PAI-1
mRNA expression (p = 0.0001) indicating suppression is
regulated at the transcript level (Figure 2B). To determine
the effect of TM5441 on early stage of Doxorubicininduced endothelial senescence, we measured the
protein levels of p53 and PAI-1. Data show that after 24h
treatment of Doxorubicin, the levels of p53 and PAI-1
proteins are significantly elevated at early time point and
TM5441 suppresses the basal as well as Doxorubicininduced elevated levels of p53 and PAI-1 (Supplemental
Figure 3). Therefore, our data clearly predicts that
pretreatment with TM5441 reduces Doxorubicininduced cellular senescence. Since high concentration of
Doxorubicin induces significant DNA damage, we asked
whether low concentration of Doxorubicin (50 nM) (in
our experimental conditions) affects DNA integrity. We
observed that while 50 nM Doxorubicin inhibited cellular
proliferation and induced senescence markers like p53 and
PAI-1, no appreciable DNA damage was observed within
24 h. TM5441 had no effect on the integrity of genomic
DNA as well (Data not shown).
As ERK1/2 MAPK and GSK3α/β are known to

be involved in cellular senescence in certain cell types
[5, 6], we examined the level of pERK1/2 MAPK in
Doxorubicin-induced senescent cells. Results show that
TM5441 fails to block Doxorubicin-induced suppression
of ERK1/2 MAPK activation in endothelial cells
(Figure 2) indicating ERK1/2MAPK is not involved in
TM5441-mediated inhibition of Doxorubicin-induced
cellular senescence. The levels of pGSK3α/β are not
altered by the presence of TM5441 in endothelial cells
(Figure 2). Next the efficacy of TM5441 in prevention of
Doxorubicin-induced senescence in rat cardiomyocytes
was investigated. In H9c2 cells, the level of senescence
regulator p16 protein is elevated by Doxorubicin
compared to basal level. Importantly, PAI-1 inhibitor
TM5441 significantly reduces the Doxorubicin-induced
elevated level of p16 in rat cardiomyocytes H9c2 (Figure
3A upper panel). Doxorubicin treatment causes modest
increase in cleaved caspase3 (active form) levels in
H9c2. However, pretreatment with TM5441 reduces
the levels of cleaved caspase3 in Doxorubicin treated
H9c2 (Figure 3A lower panel). We further investigated
the effect of PAI-1 inhibitor TM5441 on Doxorubicininduced senescence in fibroblasts and the underlying
molecular basis. Western blot analysis of protein extracts
for senescence regulators show that while IGFBP3
level is stimulated by Doxorubicin in mouse embryonic

markers and regulators by Western blot using specific antibodies as indicated.

fibroblasts (MEFs), the level of p16 remains unaltered
compared to basal level of p16. However, PAI-1 inhibitor
TM5441 decreases the potent senescence regulators p16
and IGFBP3 in Doxorubicin treated MEFs (Figure 3B).
In primary cultures of neonatal mouse cardiac fibroblasts,
Doxorubicin induces the levels of p21 and IGFBP3 and
the Doxorubicin-induced stimulation of p21 and IGFBP3
levels are significantly decreased by TM5441 indicating
PAI-1 inhibition efficiently blocks fibroblast senescence
(Figure 3C). In order to understand the signaling
pathways involved in TM5441-mediated suppression of
Doxorubicin-induced fibroblast senescence, we examined
ERK1/2-MAPK, AMPK and GSK3α/β pathways which
are known to be involved in Doxorubicin-induced
senescence and apoptosis [1, 2, 5, 6]. Doxorubicin inhibits

pERK1/2 MAPK levels. However, TM5441 fails to block
Doxorubicin-induced inhibition of ERK1/2 MAP kinase
activation in MEFs (Figure 3B). The levels of pAMPK
and pGSK3α/β are modestly inhibited by TM5441 in the
presence of Doxorubicin in fibroblasts (Figure 3B).
TM5441 blunts Doxorubicin-mediated suppression of
catalase in endothelial cells
As endothelial cells are the major source of PAI-1
and involved in different cardiovascular diseases [8-17],
we choose to use endothelial cells to study the effect of
PAI-1 inhibitor on Doxorubicin-induced ROS and ROS
quenching factors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play

cellular senescence in response to TGF-β and in vitro
culture shock in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Mouse
embryonic fibroblasts were treated with TGF-β or cultured
for prolonged period in the presence or absence of small
molecule TM5441. Cell lysates were prepared and
subjected to Western blot for senescence markers. Protein
analysis results indicate that under this experimental
condition, the level of p21 is not induced by TGF-β,
however PAI-1 inhibitor TM5441 efficiently reduces the
levels of potent senescence regulators p21 and IGFBP3
in TGF-β treated and culture-shocked MEFs respectively
(Figure 5A, 5B). Next we examined the effect of PAI-1
inhibitor TM5441 on cellular replicative senescence in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts. MEFs (passage 6) were
treated with or without TM5441 and passaged up to 11.
Whole cell extracts were prepared from passage 6 (as
early passage) and passage 11 (as late passage) in the
presence and absence of TM5441. Western blot analysis
results show that the levels of senescence markers p21 and
p16 are significantly elevated in passage 11 (late) MEFs
compared to passage 6 (early) MEFs. However, the levels
of p16 and p21 were reduced in passage 11 cells grown
in the presence of TM5441 (10 µM from passage 6 to 11)
(Figure 5C). The levels of PAI-1 are elevated in higher
passage compared to early passage. Presence of TM5441
partially blocks the level of PAI-1 protein in fibroblasts.
These results indicate that PAI-1 inhibitor TM5441 is
effective in blocking aging-associated or replicative
cellular senescence.

a major role in stress-induced diseases and aging. ROS
are produced in both mitochondria and non-mitochondrial
sources as by-products of different metabolic processes
in stressed cells. Several endogenous enzymes including
catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase
(SOD) are involved in protection of ROS-induced
cellular damage [22]. Here we first determine the effect of
TM5441 on Doxorubicin-induced ROS generation using
MitoSOX™ Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator
for live-cell imaging. Data in endothelial cells show
that Doxorubicin induces the level of ROS production
and TM5441 significantly reduces the level of ROS as
evidenced by the level of red fluorescence images of
superoxide-mediated oxidized MitoSOX™ Red reagent
(p < 0.05) (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 4A, 4B).
Next we determined the effect of TM5441 on
mRNA expression levels of ROS quenching molecules
catalase, SOD and glutathione peroxidase in Doxorubicin
treated endothelial cells. The qPCR analysis of total RNA
isolated from control and treatment groups demonstrate
that while Doxorubicin suppresses the expression of ROS
quenching factor catalase, TM5441 induces the basal level
of catalase and blunts Doxorubicin-mediated suppression
of catalase mRNA expression (p = 0.028) (Figure 4B).
Like catalase mRNA, Doxorubicin also reduces the levels
of catalase protein in endothelial cells and fails to inhibit
catalase protein in the presence of PAI-1 inhibitor TM5441
(Figure 4B). Under the same experimental condition, the
level of Glutathinone peroxidase mRNA expression is
not significantly affected by Doxorubicin and TM5441
in this endothelial cell line (Figure 4B). We also noticed
that SOD mRNA level is upregulated by Doxorubicin and
TM5441 suppresses the increased expression of SOD by
Doxorubicin. TM5441 alone modestly induces SOD basal
expression (Supplemental Figure 4C). We suspect that the
elevated level of SOD in the presence of Doxorubicin may
be due to an adaptive response. As TGF-β is also a SASP
or SMS [1, 2], we have determined the level of TGF-β1
mRNA. The level of TGF-β1 mRNA is not affected by the
presence of Doxorubicin. However, TM5441 reduces the
level of TGF-β1 mRNA in the presence of Doxorubicin
(Supplemental Figure 4D). Next we have determined the
effect of Doxorubicin and TM5441 on expression level
of NFκB. NFκB is one of the critical nuclear factors
upregulated by enhanced oxidative stress and plays a key
role in senescence [23]. Our data show that Doxorubicin
induces the level of NFκB and TM5441 suppresses that
induction (Figure 4C).

TM5484, another potent inhibitor of PAI-1,
inhibits cellular senescence
Next we tested the efficacy of another small
molecule TM5484, a potent inhibitor of PAI-1, in
suppression of Doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence
in endothelial cells (Figure 6A) and cardiomyocytes
(Figure 6B). Cells were pretreated with TM5484 for 24 h
followed by Doxorubicin treatment for 4 days. At the end
of treatment, cells were harvested and cell lysates were
prepared and subjected to Western blot. Results reveal
that like TM5441, TM5484 also significantly inhibits
Doxorubicin-induced senescence regulator p16 and p21
in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes (Figure 6A, 6B).

DISCUSSION
Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plays
a pivotal role in cellular senescence during aging and
under pathological milieu. While physiological level
of PAI-1 is essential for maintenance of normal cellular
and physiological homeostasis, complete loss or superphysiological levels of PAI-1 are detrimental for cellular
and physiological processes. Elevated levels of PAI-1
are associated with aging and numerous human diseases

we have demonstrated that genetic or pharmacological
inhibition of PAI-1 activity increases the lifespan in a
murine model of accelerated aging [15]. Importantly,
genetically ablated PAI-1 activity in this accelerated

aging murine model (klotho deficient mice) is associated
with decreased levels of a senescence regulator p16Ink4a
and increased life span [15] indicating enhanced cellular
senescence is a significant contributor in accelerated
aging process. In order to prevent premature cellular

The individual senescent regulator functionally interacts with different other regulators like p53, p16, p21, IGFBP3, PAI-1 and participate
in cellular senescence process in a cell type or stressor-dependent manner. Inhibition of cellular PAI-1 activity using specific small molecule
inhibitor and activation of tPA/uPA axis are able to disrupt this senescent regulatory network and senescence in all three major normal cell

senescence associated with accelerated aging process,
we examined the effect of a druggable small moleculemediated inhibition of stress or aging-associated elevated
levels of PAI-1 in prevention of cellular senescence in
three major cell types, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells
and fibroblasts.
The major findings of the present study provide
substantial evidences in favor of the protective role of
PAI-1 inhibitor TM5441 on Doxorubicin-induced and
replicative senescence and underpinning molecular
basis. We choose to study the effect of TM5441 on
Doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence using three
major cell types. The rationale behind using Doxorubicin
as a senescence stressor in the present study was twofold.
First, Doxorubicin generates reactive oxygen species
(ROS) the major mediator of cellular senescence;
Second, while Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer
drug, its major downside is its cardiotoxic side-effects
due to DNA intercalation leading to cellular senescence,
apoptosis, cardiomyopathy and ultimate death in a
high percentage of patients treated with this drug [19].
Therefore, identification of a druggable small molecule
inhibitor of senescence is an important task to prevent
senescence and apoptosis-associated cardiomyopathy
and abnormal cardiac function. As Doxorubicin induces
the levels of PAI-1, as evidenced by in vitro studies as
well as in patients treated with anticancer drug [11, 20],
inhibition of elevated PAI-1 levels using specific inhibitor
may protect patients from Doxorubicin-induced cellular
abnormality in healthy cells. The present study identified
that PAI-1 inhibitor TM5441 blocks both stress-activated
and replicative cellular senescence via suppression of a
major pool of senescence regulators including p16, p21,
p53, IGFBP3 and PAI-1. It is important to note that the
extent of TM5441 mediated suppression of senescence
regulators are cell-type specific. The next obvious question
is how PAI-1 inhibitor TM5441 blocks the induction of
different senescence mediators or regulators. We propose
that beneficial effect of TM5441 stems from its ability
to prevent Doxorubicin-induced catalase suppression.
Increased catalase expression reduces oxidative stress on
endothelial cells and reduces stress induced premature
senescence (SIPS). This notion is in agreement with
previous observation that overexpressed catalase inhibits
redox-induced PAI-1 expression [24], and also protects
hearts from Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity [21, 25,
26]. Secondly, the cell cycle regulator and senescence
mediator p53 is also known to be induced by DNA
damage and is a known inducer of both PAI-1 and cell
cycle inhibitor p21. Although p53 is a bonafide inducer
of cellular senescence, Leontieva et al. [27] demonstrated
that while low levels of p53 induces geroconversion,
high levels of p53 causes gerosuppression via inhibition
of mTOR. As overexpressed PAI-1 mediates cellular
senescence even in the absence of p53 [9], it is reasonable
to speculate that cellular PAI-1 exerts its pro-senescence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activity directly or indirectly via modulation of other
important senescence regulators.
PAI-1 inhibitor TM5441-mediated suppression of
ROS may at least partially inhibit p53 expression and
that may affect expression of p53 target genes p21 and
PAI-1. Similarly, inhibition of PAI-1 protein level in
TM5441 treated cells may be due to suppression of ROS
generation because ROS augments PAI-1 expression [28].
Thirdly, another important senescent regulator IGFBP3 is
a downstream target of PAI-1-tPA axis where tPA inhibits
IGFBP3 by proteolysis [11]. Using an unbiased analysis of
SASP, recently Ozcan et al. [29] also identified IGFBP3PAI-1 is one of the key signaling pathways involved in
cellular senescence in response to different genotoxic
stressors. The inhibition of Doxorubicin-induced
senescence regulator IGFBP3 by TM5441 may be due
to activated tPA-mediated proteolysis of IGFBP3 in the
absence of active PAI-1. As IGFBP3 is a positive regulator
of cell cycle regulator p16, TM5441-mediated suppression
of p16 is likely due to decreased level of IGFBP3 (Figure
7). It is important to note that a recent study demonstrated
that TM5441 decreased the viability of different cancer
cell lines and reduced tumor growth. However, TM5441
did not potentiate the cytotoxicity of Doxorubicin in
these cancer cell lines [17]. Therefore, these results
together suggest the usefulness and significance of PAI1 specific safe druggable small molecule inhibitor in
preventing senescence of healthy cells during exposure to
chemotherapeutic drug Doxorubicin and also during aging
process.
Lastly, we also investigated whether TM5441
mediated suppression of Doxorubicin-induced senescence
is due to alteration of specific kinase pathway that is
known to be involved in cellular senescence. Previous
studies established the involvement of MAPKs in
senescence and apoptosis in different cell types. For
example, ERK1/2 MAPK, p38 MAPK, AMPK and
AKT play a role in the regulation of cellular senescence
induced by a wide variety of stressors including hydrogen
peroxide, in vitro culture shock, Doxorubicin treatment
etc. [1, 2, 5, 6, 30]. Additionally, activation or inhibition of
these kinases blocks doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte
and other cellular dysfunction [31-36]. Here, we examined
the activity of ERK1/2 MAPK, AMPK and GSK-3α/β
signal transducers in Doxorubicin and PAI-1 inhibitor
TM5441 treated cells. Present study showed that while
the levels of pERK1/2 MAPK is dramatically abrogated
by Doxorubicin, pAMPK levels were modestly affected.
The Doxorubicin-induced inhibition of pERK1/2 MAPK
was not rescued by TM5441 treatment indicating ERK1/2
MAPK may not be involved in the TM5441-mediated
inhibition of Doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence.
The present study also demonstrated that TM5441
modestly inhibits the levels of pGSK3α/β in endothelial
cells treated with Doxorubicin indicating that TM5441
may exerts its rescue effect on Doxorubicin-induced

endothelial cellular senescence via suppression of
GSK3α/β activation.
In conclusion, we have discovered that PAI1 inhibitor TM5441 efficiently decreases the levels
of senescence in three major normal cell types i.e.,
cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells via
suppression of major senescence regulators p16, p21,
p53, IGFBP3 and PAI-1 in a cell-type specific manner
(Figure 7). These cadres of cellular senescence are known
to induce senescence individually as well as coordinately
based on cell type and nature of stressors or insults and
aging process as discussed earlier. Based on our results
in vascular endothelial cells, it is reasonable to conclude
that suppression of ROS generation and activation of
antioxidant catalase play a pivotal role in TM5441mediated suppression of cellular senescence. The
beneficial inhibitory effect of TM5441 on senescence in
these normal cells may be due to suppression of specific
signaling pathway and specific senescence regulator in a
cell type dependent manner. Therefore, it is reasonable
to infer that suppression of PAI-1 using small molecule
inhibitor is an ideal approach to prevent Doxorubicininduced premature senescence of different cells and aging
associated cellular abnormality. Future study using animal
model is necessary to validate the protective role of PAI1 inhibitor on Doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence,
cardiomyopathy and replacement cardiac fibrosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Induction of cellular senescence,
extraction and western blot

Cell culture and treatment with senescence
inducers and PAI-1 inhibitors

Cardiomyocytes H9c2, endothelial cells EA.hy926,
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and neonatal mouse
cardiac fibroblasts (nMCFs) were cultured in 12-well
culture plates and pretreated with TM5441 or TM5484 in
triplicate (10 µM) for 24 h followed by Doxorubicin (50
nM) treatment for 1-4 days. At the end of indicated period
of incubation, cells from three wells were harvested and
pooled. For TGF-β treatment, MEFs were pretreated with
TM5441 for 1h followed by TGF-β for 24 h. For culture
shock, cells were grown for seven days and then treated
with TM5441. Whole cell protein lysates were prepared
using RIPA lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Proteins were pooled
from three control and treated wells. Equal amount of
proteins were loaded on 4-12% Tris-glycine gradient
gel and run at 90 volts for 2 h at room-temperature. The
separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane
using iBlot transfer apparatus (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY). The PVDF membranes were blocked with 10% fat
free milk containing TBST for 2 h at room temperature.
Then membranes were incubated with antibodies against
p16, p21, p53, IGFBP3, PAI-1, pERK1/2, pAMPK,
pGSK3α/β and Actin overnight at 4oC. The membranes
were washed followed by incubation with HRP-tagged
specific secondary antibodies. The membranes were

SA-β-gal assay
The widely used biomarker for senescent cells
is the SA-β-galactosidase activity. SA-β-gal activity
is detectable at pH 6.0 in senescent cells (BioVision,
Milpitas, CA). Beta-galactosidase activity is expressed
from GLB1, the gene encoding lysosomal-galactosidase.
Cardiomyocytes H9c2, endothelial cells EA.hy926, mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and neonatal mouse cardiac
fibroblasts (nMCFs) were cultured in 12-well culture
plates and pretreated with TM5441 for 24 h followed by
Doxorubicin (50 nM) treatment in triplicate for 4 days.
At the end of treatment, cells were processed for SA-βgal using Senescence Assay Kit (Catalog Cat#K320-250;
BioVision, Milpitas, CA). In brief, culture medium was
removed and cells were washed once with 1X PBS
and fixed with fixative solution for 15 min at room
temperature. After fixation, cells were washed twice
with 1XPBS and staining solution containing staining
supplement and X-gal was added to each well and mixed.
Plates were covered with aluminum foil and incubated
overnight at 37°C without CO2. The SA-β-gal staining in
cells were observed under a microscope for development
of blue color and photographed.

Rat cardiomyoblast cells H9c2 proliferate in culture
and serves as an animal-free alternative. H9c2 cells and
primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes show almost identical
hypertrophic responses when exposed to Angiotensin
II and Endothelin-1 based on average cellular area/
hypertrophy and expression of F-actin, s-α-actinin and
BNP [37]. Human endothelial cells EA.hy926 is derived
by fusing HUVEC and human lung carcinoma cell line
A549. This cell line possesses endothelial characteristics.
[38]. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), rat neonatal
cardiomyocytes H9c2, human cardiac fibroblasts and
human endothelial cells EA.hy926 were purchased
from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Neonatal mouse cardiac
fibroblasts were isolated from neonatal wildtype mice and
primary cultures were established. All cells were grown
in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
penicillin and streptomycin and maintained at 37oC in a
5% CO2 incubator. Confluent cultures were typsinized
and 50000-100000 cells/well were subcultured in 12 wellclusters and were pretreated with TM5441 or TM5484 in
triplicate for 24 h followed by Doxorubicin treatment for

Cell proliferation assay

ROS measurement

Cardiac fibroblasts in 24-well culture plates were
pretreated with TM5441 for 24 h followed by Doxorubicin
treatment for 24 h (n = 6 wells). At the end of incubation,
fibroblast proliferation was determined using CyQUANTDirect assay kit according to manufacturer’s instruction
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Number of cells in control
and treatment groups (n = 6 wells) were determined by
ImagePro 9.1 software and presented as mean ± sem.

Human endothelial cells were pretreated with
TM5441 (10 µM) for 24h followed by treatment with
Doxorubicin (50 nM) in triplicate for 2 h. Cells were
washed twice with HBSS and MitoSox Red fluorescent
dye was used to assess mitochondrial O2 production
following manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Cells were incubated with MitoSox Red at 37oC for
30 minutes. At the end of incubation cells were washed
twice with HBSS. Stained cells in three independently
treated wells were photographs in fluorescence microscope
and analyzed. Red fluorescent positive cells were
quantified using Image Pro-9.1 premier software (Media
Cybernetics Inc., Rockville, MD).

DNA damage assay
The effect of TM5441 on Doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage was determined by DNA fragmentation
assay following published method [39]. The genomic
was isolated from DMSO (control), TM5441 alone,
Doxorubicin, and Doxorubicin+TM5541 combo treated
endothelial cells using genomic DNA isolation kit
(Qiagen). The extracted DNA from control and treated
samples were subjected to electrophoresis on ethidium
bromide dye containing 2 % agarose gel and was
photographed in BIORAD imager under UV light.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as Mean ± SEM. The significance
of differences between controls and experimental groups
was estimated by one way ANOVA and the Turkey
Multiple-comparison post hoc test. A value of P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses
were performed with GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc, San Diego).

Quantitative qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNAs from control and treated cultured
endothelial cells in triplicate were isolated and specific
transcript level was determined by qPCR using gene
specific primers. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels
of p53, PAI-1, catalase, glutathione peroxidase 1, NFκB, SOD1, TGF-β and GAPDH were quantified by
complementary DNA synthesis using iScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and quantitative
polymerase chain reaction with SYBR Green
SuperMix for IQ (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg,
MD). Q-gene software was used for quantification.
The qPCR primer sequences are as follows: Catalase
