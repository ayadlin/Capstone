Abstract
Radiation-induced activation of the phosphatidyl inositol-3
kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway requires Akt binding
to phosphatidyl-inositol phosphates (PIP) on the cell membrane. The tyrosine kinase bone marrow X kinase (Bmx) binds
to membrane-associated PIPs in a manner similar to Akt.
Because Bmx is involved in cell growth and survival pathways,
it could contribute to the radiation response within the
vascular endothelium. We therefore studied Bmx signaling
within the vascular endothelium. Bmx was activated rapidly in
response to clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation. Bmx
inhibition enhanced the efficacy of radiotherapy in endothelial
cells as well as tumor vascular endothelium in lung cancer
tumors in mice. Retroviral shRNA knockdown of Bmx protein
enhanced human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC)
radiosensitization. Furthermore, pretreatment of HUVEC with
a pharmacologic inhibitor of Bmx, LFM-A13, produced
significant radiosensitization of endothelial cells as measured
by clonogenic survival analysis and apoptosis as well as
functional assays including cell migration and tubule formation. In vivo, LFM-A13, when combined with radiation, resulted
in significant tumor microvascular destruction as well as
enhanced tumor growth delay. Bmx therefore represents a
molecular target for the development of novel radiosensitizing
agents. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2861–9]

Introduction
The microvasculature is a major component of cancer and
supports tumor growth. We and others have studied the inherent
resistance of tumor vascular endothelium to cytotoxic effects of
ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation activates signal transduction
through the phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway,
which enhances endothelial cell viability (1–3). Akt activity is critical
for this process because dominant-negative Akt mutant (Thr308Ala
and Ser473Ala) overexpression in endothelial cells abrogates
radiation-induced cell survival response (4). Moreover, we have
previously shown that ionizing radiation–induced Akt activation is
eliminated by overexpression of mutant p85 component of PI3K (5).
Mutant p85 functions as a dominant negative by preventing
activation of p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K. This inhibition prevents
the production of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIP) that
activate Akt, resulting in enhanced radiation effect. Therefore,
inhibition of the PI3K signal transduction pathway can abrogate the
endothelial cell survival signaling mediated by Akt.

Although the PI3K/Akt pathway is a major contributor to
radiation resistance seen in tumor microvasculature, other pathways activated shortly after ionizing radiation are also being
investigated. Indeed, the activation of Akt has been shown to be
critically dependent on binding of the pleckstrin homology domain
of Akt to specific PIPs, phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-triphosphate, in
particular, which allows the colocalization of Akt with upstream
activators (6). Bone marrow X kinase (Bmx), also known as
epithelial and endothelial tyrosine kinase, contains a pleckstrin
homology domain as well as Src homology (SH)2 and SH3 domains
capable of interacting with several types of second messengers and
adaptor proteins that are present in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC; refs. 7–13). Bmx is the ubiquitously
expressed member of the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases
with high expression in lung, prostate, and the heart (10, 11). In
addition, salivary epithelium, granulomonocytic cells, endothelial
cells, and epithelial cells express this protein in relatively high
amounts (10, 11, 14–16). Bmx seems to act both upstream and
downstream of PI3K (7, 10, 11, 17–21). Bmx also interacts with
G-proteins (10, 22–24), integrins/NRTKs (7, 25), tumor necrosis
factor receptors (9), as well as various protein tyrosine phosphatases (26) and lipid phosphatases (27).
Because Bmx seems to potentiate proliferative and cell survival
signaling in many cell types, we investigated Bmx signaling
transduction during the radiation response in vascular endothelium. In the present study, radiation-induced Bmx activation in
vascular endothelium was investigated. We show that inhibition of
Bmx activity enhances the effectiveness of radiation on vasculature.
These findings support the hypothesis that Bmx promotes a cell
survival pathway and is a molecular target for drug development in
the treatment of cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HUVECs were purchased from Clonetics and maintained in
EBM-2 medium supplemented with EBM-2 singlequots (Cambrex). HUVECs
were limited to passages 3 to 6. Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were
purchased from American Type Tissue Culture and maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. Cell lines were incubated at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator.
LFM-A13 (30 Amol/L in vitro or 50 mg/kg, i.p. in vivo) and DMSO was
obtained from Sigma. Drug was administered to cells 30 to 60 min before
irradiation. A Mark-1 Irradiator 137Cs (JL Shepard and Assoc.) was used to
irradiate HUVEC cultures at a dose rate of 1.897 Gy/min.
Retrovirus production and HUVEC infection. Negative control and
Bmx shRNA retroviral constructs were purchased from OriGene, Inc. A total
of five different constructs (labeled Bmx A–E) were tested for Bmx
knockdown in HUVEC. The retroviruses were produced according to
manufacturer’s protocol with some modifications. LiNX packaging cell line,
purchased from Open Biosystems, was grown on 10-cm tissue culture plates
to 30% to 40% confluency in medium containing DMEM with 10% FBS
[complete growth medium (CGM)] with hygromycin, penicillin, and
streptomycin supplementation. These cells were then transfected with

retroviral plasmid DNA by incubation with 5 mL transfection mix for 4 to 6 h.
The transfection mix contained 12 Ag of shRNA retroviral vector DNA within
600 AL serum-free DMEM without antibiotics, and 240 AL of room
temperature Arrest-In transfection reagent (Open Biosystems) within
4.4 mL serum-free DMEM without antibiotics, which was prepared and
kept at room temperature for 45 min before transfection to allow for
transfection complexes to be formed. After initial 4- to 6-h transfection, 5 mL
of CGM were added and incubated overnight. The medium was changed and
the cells were incubated for at least an additional 24 h. Supernatant was
collected and filtered through a 45-Am filter to produce the viral stock.
For HUVEC infection, HUVECs were grown on tissue culture plates to
50% confluency. On the day of infection, the HUVECs were incubated in
medium containing 5 Ag/mL polybrene for 4 h before infection. Medium
was then removed and 1.5 mL of virus supernatant supplemented with
5 Ag/mL polybrene were added directly to the cells and allowed to adsorb
for 40 to 60 min, and then 7 mL of HUVEC medium containing 5 Ag/mL of
polybrene were added, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. The medium
was changed to regular HUVEC growth medium, and the cells were
incubated for an additional 2 d to allow for Bmx knockdown.
Cell lysis and immunoblot analysis. HUVECs of passage 3 to 6 were
treated with or without Bmx inhibition (LFM-A13 for 60 min or shRNA
retrovirus infection 48 h before) followed by irradiation and then harvested at
the indicated times. Cells were processed and immunoblotted as described
previously (28). Antibodies were as follows: PY20HRP (BD Biosciences), actin
(Sigma-Aldrich), Bmx and PY40 Bmx (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphoAkt (S473), Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), as well as horseradish
peroxidase–labeled mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich)
except for PY20HRP, which was prelabeled. Films were scanned into Adobe
Photoshop with subsequent densitometry analysis using NIH Image J 1.37v.
Experiments were performed at least thrice.
Immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay. HUVECs of passage 3
to 6 were grown to 70% to 80% confluency and then serum starved for 5 h.
The cells were then treated with sham or 3 Gy irradiation. After treatment,
the cells were incubated at 37jC with 5% CO2 for the indicated times. For
inhibition studies, inhibitor was added at a 1:1,000 dilution 60 min before
irradiation. After incubation, the tissue culture dishes were placed on ice
and washed twice with ice cold 1 PBS followed by lysis using 400 AL
M-PER containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) for 5 min.
The cells were scraped and transferred to Eppendorf tubes, vortexed for
20 sec, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After clearing the lysate by
centrifugation at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4jC, the supernatant was quantified
for protein concentration using bicinchoninic acid method before
immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the Catch
and Release v 2.0 system (Upstate) according to manufacturer’s protocol
with some modification. Briefly, spin columns containing binding resin were
prepared by washing twice with 1 wash buffer (2,000 g/30 sec). After
column preparation, 500 Ag of cell lysate were combined with 2 Ag of antiBmx antibody (H-220; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 10 AL of affinity
ligand, and enough 1 wash buffer to have a 500 AL final volume. This was
added to the capped spin column that was rotated end-over-end overnight
at 4jC. The spin column was washed thrice with 1 wash buffer followed
by elution using 70 AL of 1 nondenaturing elution (native protein elution)
buffer. For in vitro kinase assay, 35 AL of eluate were then combined with
25 AL of kinase buffer containing 25 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L
h-Glycerophosphate, 2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 10 mmol/L
MgCl2 with 1 AL of 10 mmol/L ATP, and this was incubated for 20 min at
37jC. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 AL of 4 SDS sample buffer
and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then run on SDS-PAGE and antiPY20HRP (BD Biosciences) and anti-Bmx (Cell Signaling Technology).
Western blotting was performed to identify phosphorylated protein bands
at 75 to 80 kDa. Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image J.
WST-1 assay. This assay is a modification of an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and was performed per
manufacturer’s protocol (Calbiochem). Briefly, HUVEC were infected with
shRNA retrovirus, and after 48 h of incubation, cells were lifted by
trypsinization, were counted, and were plated at 10,000 cells per well of
96-well microtiter plates in duplicate. These plates were then subjected to 0

or 2 Gy and incubated for 24 h at 37jC with 5% CO2. After incubation, 10 AL
of WST-1 labeling mixture was added to each well and mixed gently before
returning to the incubator for 2 h. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured on
a microplate reader and results were plotted using Microsoft Excel Software.
Clonogenic survival. LLC or passage 3 to 6 HUVECs were grown to 70%
to 80% confluency. Cells were washed with 1 PBS, trypsin suspended, and
were counted and adjusted to specific densities for each condition. The cells
were then plated on tissue culture plates and allowed to attach for 4 h. LFMA13 or DMSO was added at a 1:1,000; dilution followed 60 min later by 0, 2,
4, or 6 Gy. Medium was changed after irradiation. Ten to fourteen days after
irradiation, the plates were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 1%
methylene blue. Colonies were then counted using a dissection microscope
with positive colonies containing at least 50 cells. Surviving fraction was
calculated by the equation (number of colonies formed/number of cells
plated)/(number of colonies for sham irradiated group/number of cells
plated). Dose-enhancing ratios were calculated by dividing the dose (Gy) for
radiation alone by the dose for radiation plus treatment (normalized for
plating efficiency of treatment) for which a surviving fraction of 0.2 is
achieved. These results were then plotted in a semilogarithmic format using
Microsoft Excel software.
Endothelial cell tubule formation assay. HUVEC of passage 3 to 6 were
grown to 70% to 80% confluency. Cells were then washed with 1 PBS and
suspended by trypsinization. Cells were counted and adjusted to 2.5 to
5  104 cells per mL in medium. Seventy-five microliters of Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) were plated into each well of a 96-well plate and allowed
to polymerize at 37jC. Cell suspensions (200 AL; 8–12  103 cells) were added
to each well. After 30 min, DMSO control or LFM-A13 was added. Thirty
minutes later, dishes were treated with sham or 3 Gy and were then incubated
until tubules had formed in control plates (4–6 h). Digital photographs were
taken of individual wells and tubules were counted by an observer blinded
to the treatment conditions. The mean and SE were calculated (n = 3).
Endothelial closure assay. HUVEC of passage 3 to 6 were grown on
glass slides and were subjected to gap formation as described previously
(28). Cells were treated with LFM-A13 or DMSO control before 0 or 3 Gy and
incubated for the indicated times. Photographs of cell defect and
surrounding cells were taken, and relative cell density within the defect
was calculated as follows: (number of cells/original cell defect area)/
(number of cells/surrounding area).
Apoptosis assays. HUVEC were grown to 70% to 80% confluency before
treatment with LFM-A13 or DMSO control. Cells were then irradiated with 0
or 3 Gy and harvested 24 h after irradiation. Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis
Detection kit (BD PharMingen) was used to stain cells [propidium iodide
(50 ng) and Annexin V–FITC (5 ng) were added to 105 cells] for flow
cytometry according to manufacturer’s protocol. For each treatment, the
percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis (FSE) was calculated. Camptothecin (5 Amol/L) treatment for 6 h served as positive control.
HUVEC were also assayed for apoptosis using a 4’,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) staining of the nuclei to identify cells undergoing
morphologic changes. Seventy to eighty percent confluent HUVECs were
treated with or without LFM-A13, incubated for 1 h, and then irradiated at 3
Gy. Cells were returned to the incubator for an additional 24 h before DAPI
staining. Multiple high powered fields (at least seven) were examined by an
observer who was blinded to the experimental conditions for each of the
cultures. The percentage of cells demonstrating apoptotic nuclei were
quantified. The mean and SE were calculated for each treatment group.
Tumor vascular window model. We have previously described the
tumor vascular window model technique (29). Briefly, three mice for each
group had LLC tumors grown within a vascular window such that tumor
vasculature could be visualized within window frames containing a
coordinate system for serial photography. Animals were treated with
LFM-A13 by i.p. injection 60 min before 2 Gy irradiation using an 80 kVp
superficial X-ray machine (Pantak X-ray Generator). Serial color photographs were taken to document blood vessel appearance on days 0 to 7.
Photographs were scanned and processed using Adobe Photoshop software
(Adobe) to mark the center of vessels, verified by an observer blinded to
treatment groups. Vascular length density (VLD) was quantified for each
microscopic field using ImagePro Plus v. 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics,

Bmx Signaling in Irradiated Vascular Endothelium
Inc.). The mean and SE of VLD in each treatment group were calculated and
plotted. All animals used were cared for according to Vanderbilt University’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees guidelines.
Tumor immunohistochemistry. LLCs were s.c. injected into the hind
limb of C57/BL6 mice to form syngeneic homografts. When tumors grew to
200 mm3, (f7 d) the mice were treated with five consecutive daily
treatments of i.p. LFM-A13 followed 45 min later by 3 Gy irradiation using an
80-kVp superficial X-ray generator. Twelve hours after the last radiation
treatment, mice were sacrificed and tumors were harvested, fixed in paraffin,
and sectioned by the Vanderbilt University Immunohistochemistry Core
Facility as we have described previously (28). Immunostaining was with goat
anti-CD34 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and microvascular photos were
analyzed using ImagePro software with pixel number quantified.
Tumor growth delay. LLCs were s.c. injected into the hind limb of C57/
BL6 mice to form syngeneic homografts. When tumors grew to 200 mm3,
(f7 d) the mice were treated with five consecutive daily treatments of i.p.
LFM-A13 followed 45 min later by 3 Gy irradiation using an 80 kVp
superficial X-ray generator. Serial measurements of tumor dimensions were
taken by caliper, and tumor volume was calculated using the modified
ellipsoid formula (length  width  depth)/2. The mean and SE were
plotted using Microsoft Excel software.
Statistical analysis. The mean and SEs for all assays were calculated
using Microsoft Excel software. Student’s t test was performed to determine
P values between treatment groups. P values of V0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Results
Bmx is activated in endothelium upon irradiation. We
examined primary culture vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) to
determine whether Bmx was activated by ionizing radiation,
because of its similarities in structure and signaling with that of
Akt, and was possibly contributing to radiation resistance.
Figure 1A shows a time course of Bmx activation upon irradiation
with a clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy. Tyr40, present in the
pleckstrin homology domain of Bmx, becomes phosphorylated
during its activation (7). Bmx is phosphorylated at 60 minutes after
2 Gy of irradiation. To confirm this finding, we used an in vitro
kinase assay in which Bmx was immunoprecipitated from
irradiated or sham-irradiated endothelial cells and then incubated
with ATP in a kinase reaction. These samples were then run on
SDS-PAGE and probed for antiphosphotyrosine to analyze
autophosphorylation of Bmx. As shown in Fig. 1B, Bmx was
activated after irradiation. Examination of total Bmx revealed no
change in Bmx levels at any of the time points that were assayed.
Densitometric quantitation (mean and SE) from four separate
experiments is shown as well. Interestingly, Bmx showed significant
kinase activity immediately after irradiation and then has a second
peak of lesser activity at 1 hour.
Bmx knockdown enhances radiation efficacy in endothelium.
Because we were able to detect a clear activation of Bmx after a
clinically relevant dose of ionizing radiation, we wanted to
determine whether Bmx activation protects the endothelial cells
from cytoxic damage. Because primary culture endothelial cells,
such as HUVEC, have low transfection yields, we used a retroviral
shRNA system to knockdown Bmx levels before irradiation.
Figure 2A shows five different retroviral constructs (A through E)
for Bmx as well as a negative control construct (Neg) that
were used to infect HUVEC. After 48 hours, infected cells were
harvested and lysates were prepared for total Bmx Western
blotting. As can be seen, construct A (shBmxA) provided f90%
knockdown of Bmx protein levels compared with the negative
control shRNA vector. Bmx knockdown experiments were
performed with or without irradiation. Figure 2B shows MTTbased (WST-1) survival assay with HUVEC infected with either
shBmxA or negative control vectors. After 48 hours, cells were
counted and plated at 10,000 cells per well in duplicate within
96-well dishes. The cells were treated with either sham (0 Gy) or 2
Gy irradiation and incubated for 24 hours. After this incubation,
WST-1 labeling mixture was added to each well and analyzed at
absorbance at 450 nm to determine mitochondrial viability.
Normalized values for absorbance at 450 nm are shown as mean
and SE. Combined Bmx knockdown with irradiation decreases
HUVEC survival.
Pharmacologic inhibition of Bmx. Having established that
Bmx knockdown can enhance radiation efficacy in endothelial
cells, we wanted to determine whether or not pharmacologic
inhibition of Bmx would show the same effect. Bmx-specific
inhibitors (30–33) have been described, particularly LFM-A13,
which targets the Tec family. Because Bmx is the only Tec family
member expressed in endothelium, we studied this drug in
HUVEC. The drug, LFM-A13, has been shown to block vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced signaling through Bmx
inhibition in HUVEC at a dose of 25 Amol/L. Therefore, we used
30 Amol/L LFM-A13 for in vitro studies. Figure 3A shows 3 Amol/L
(subtherapeutic) versus 30 Amol/L LFM-A13 preincubation on
radiation-induced Bmx activation in the in vitro kinase assay at

Figure 2. Retroviral shRNA knockdown of Bmx in HUVEC. A, shRNA retrovirus
knockdown. Multiple shRNA retroviral plasmid constructs (Bmx constructs A–E
and negative control construct) were transfected into LiNX cells to produce
retroviral supernatants as described in Materials and Methods. HUVEC were
infected with the retroviral supernatants and incubated for 48 h. Cells were then
harvested and total protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western
blot analysis using anti-Bmx antibody was used to detect total Bmx levels.

the time points with highest Bmx activation. As can be seen,
30 Amol/L but not 3 Amol/L LFM-A13 attenuates the activation of
Bmx in response to 3 Gy.
Bmx inhibition attenuates endothelial cell viability. To
determine whether LFM-A13 produces a radiosensitization effect
in HUVEC, we studied clonogenic survival assays in HUVEC with
LFM-A13 preincubation (Fig. 3B). HUVEC were pretreated with
DMSO vehicle control or 30 Amol/L LFM-A13 45 minutes before
irradiation with 0, 2, 4, or 6 Gy. Colonies were allowed to form >10
days, which were then counted, and the surviving fraction was
calculated for each radiation dose. These studies indicated that
30 Amol/L LFM-A13 can radiosensitize HUVEC compared with the
control as evidenced by the statistically significant downward
survival curve shift. The dose enhancing ratio was 1.47.
Apoptosis was studied to determine whether this is a
mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity. Figure 3C illustrates the
effect of LFM-A13 on apoptosis within these cells. HUVEC treated
with 30 Amol/L LFM-A13 or DMSO control were subjected to sham
or 3 Gy irradiation and then incubated for 24 hours before
trypsinization and flow cytometric analysis. Annexin V–propidium
iodide staining revealed that drug or 3 Gy alone was not capable of
shifting cells into either early (Q4-1) or late (Q2-1) apoptosis but
that the combination of LFM-A13 and 3 Gy caused a statistically
significant (P < 0.001 versus LFM-A13 or 3 Gy alone) increase in
apoptotis. To confirm these findings, HUVEC were treated with
either 30 Amol/L LFM-A13 or DMSO control with or without 3 or

6 Gy irradiation and incubated for 24 hours. These cells were fixed
and stained with DAPI, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was
quantified. As shown in Fig. 3D, the combination of LFM-A13 and
irradiation resulted in enhancement of apoptosis (*, P < 0.05 versus
DMSO control; **, P < 0.001 versus LFM alone).
Bmx inhibition attenuates endothelial cell function. Functional assays of endothelial cells include cell migration and
capillary-like tubule formation. Figure 4A illustrates the effect of
LFM-A13 and irradiation on endothelial migration across a gap
(endothelial cell closure assay) at 12 and 24 hours. HUVEC were
plated on glass slides and grown to 80% confluency. A gap region,
free of cells, was then created using a 200-AL pipette tip. These
slides were then treated with 30 Amol/L LFM-A13 or DMSO control
for 45 minutes before either 0 or 3 Gy. Cells were fixed and stained
at 12 or 24 hours, and photographs were taken of the gap region
and the surrounding cells to determine the ability of the HUVEC to
migrate across and fill the gap. Relative cell density was calculated
for each condition to control for the cytotoxic effects of treatment
as shown in Fig. 4B. By 24 hours, control cells effectively migrated
across the gap. Thirty micromoles of LFM-A13 or 3 Gy alone had
minimal effect on attenuating endothelial cell closure at both 12
and 24 hours compared with vehicle-treated control. However, the
combination induced a greater than additive effect that was
statistically significant (*, P < 0.05 versus control; **, P < 0.01 versus
LFM-A13). Figure 4C and D show capillary tubule formation assay.
HUVEC plated onto Matrigel were treated with 30 Amol/L LFMA13 or DMSO with or without 3 Gy irradiation and allowed to form
tubules. The cells were then fixed and stained. The number of
tubules were quantified and plotted. Representative photographs
are shown in Fig. 4C and quantified in Fig. 4D. Cells that were
treated with both LFM-A13 and 3 Gy showed a significant
reduction (P < 0.005) in tubules formed compared with cells
treated with either treatment alone.
Bmx inhibition attenuates tumor vasculature. To determine
whether Bmx inhibition enhances radiation-induced destruction of
tumor vasculature in vivo, we used i.p. injection of LFM-A13 before
irradiation. A tumor vascular window chamber was placed on the
dorsum of the C57BL6 mice, and LLC cells were implanted within
the dorsal skin fold to allow for visualization of intravital tumor
vasculature. Serial photographs were taken of the same region of
the tumor, allowing for assessment of blood vessel formation and
destruction. Figure 5A shows the effect of a single 50 mg/kg i.p.
administration of LFM-A13 before 2 Gy irradiation. Representative
photographs show that combination treatment results in dramatic
reduction in tumor blood vessels. These results were quantified for
each treatment condition as mean VLD with SE (Fig. 5B; P < 0.0014
versus LFM-A13 or 2 Gy alone). To confirm these findings, we used
a hind limb syngeneic homograft model for determining vascular
density within tumor sections. LLCs were implanted into the hind
limbs of C57BL6 mice, and after tumors were formed, they were
subjected to either daily LFM-A13 (50 mg/kg i.p. injection) or
DMSO, followed 45 minutes later by 3 Gy or sham irradiation for a
total of five treatments. The tumors were then harvested and
prepared for immunohistochemistry analysis. Vessels were stained
by anti-CD34 as shown in Fig. 5C, and these were quantified as
shown in Fig. 5D. As can be seen, combination treatment was most
effective at attenuating blood vessel formation (P = 0.043 versus
ionizing radiation; P = 0.0001 versus LFM-A13 or vehicle control).
Bmx inhibition did not affect radiation sensitivity of LLC.
Although we have shown the enhancement of radiation by Bmx
inhibition within vascular endothelium, we determined whether

methylene blue. Shown are representative

C, HUVEC were placed onto Matrigel plugs
and were treated with either 30 Amol/L
LFM-A13 or DMSO vehicle control for
30 min followed by 3 Gy irradiation. The
cells were then incubated, and tubules
were allowed to form as shown by the
representative photographs. The cells were

NIH ImageJ software. Columns, mean

LFM-A13 or 3 Gy alone.

Bmx inhibition could also affect radiation sensitization in the lung
cancer cell line (LLC). As shown in Fig. 6A, LFM-A13 showed no
difference in clonogenic survival compared with DMSO control in
LLCs. This suggests that LFM-A13 enhancement of radiation was
limited to its antivascular effect in this tumor model.
Bmx inhibition enhances radiation efficacy in tumor growth
delay. Although LFM-A13 did not affect the radiosensitivity of the
LLCs, LFM-A13 could still enhance radiation effects in vivo as an
antivascular treatment. To determine whether treatment with
LFM-A13 could enhance tumor growth delay in irradiated tumors,
mice bearing LLC hind limb tumors were treated, as in Fig. 5C,
with i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg LFM-A13 or DMSO 45 minutes before
3 Gy or sham irradiation for 5 consecutive days. The mean tumor

volume and SE are plotted for each treatment group in Fig. 6B.
Whereas LFM-A13 or radiation treatment alone resulted in a small
growth delay, combination treatment showed a statistically
significant enhancement of growth delay (P = 0.027). The fold
increase in tumor volume at day 13 is also shown as mean and SE.
These data suggest that LFM-A13 can enhance the efficacy of
therapeutic radiation.

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to determine the role of Bmx in
the radiation response of tumor vasculature. We and others have
shown that radiation induces Akt phosphorylation (4, 29, 34–36).

Bmx Signaling in Irradiated Vascular Endothelium

Because the pleckstrin homology domains of Bmx and Akt bind the
same phosphatidyl-inositol (3, 4, 5) phosphate, we hypothesized
that Bmx might have a similar activation profile in response to
ionizing radiation. Activation of Bmx occurred at clinically relevant
doses of radiation: 2 to 3 Gy. Interestingly, we did note two waves of
activation in the in vitro kinase assay. The early and more
pronounced activation occurred immediately after irradiation,
whereas the later wave occurred after 30 minutes and was less
pronounced. It is possible that the second wave represents a
‘‘maturation event’’ such as phosphorylation of Tyr40 within the
pleckstrin homology domain. Phosphorylation of this site has been
shown to correlate with FAK activation in other cell types (7).
shRNA knockdown of Bmx resulted in radiation sensitization in
HUVEC, suggesting that Bmx inhibition may be a promising
pharmacologic target for radiation enhancement. Although LMFA13 is clinically used as a Btk inhibitor, many groups have used
LFM-A13 as a Bmx inhibitor due to the high homology between

Bmx and Btk. Because Btk is only found in bone marrow–derived
cells, we felt that LFM-A13 could be used effectively for Bmx
inhibition in our model systems. As we show in the in vitro kinase
assay, LFM-A13 effectively attenuates Bmx activation in response
to radiation. To confirm that this drug was not blocking all
pleckstrin homology domain–containing kinases, we performed a
time course and dose response of LFM-A13 with irradiation. Even
at doses as high as 100 Amol/L, we saw no attenuation of radiationinduced Akt phosphorylation indicative of its activation (data not
shown). This drug that specifically targets Bmx not only enhanced
the cytotoxic effects of irradiation on HUVEC but also inhibited the
function of these cultured endothelial cells. Apoptosis and
clonogenic studies revealed that LFM-A13 was capable of inducing
radiosensitization in HUVEC. Moreover, LFM-A13 in combination
with radiation resulted in dramatic effects on endothelial cell
migration as evidenced by the endothelial closure assay and tubule
formation assay.

Figure 5. Tumor vascular destruction is enhanced by Bmx inhibition and radiation. Tumor vascular window model: A transparent window chamber was placed
onto the dorsal skin fold of C57BL6 mice to allow for visualization of blood vessels. LLC cells were injected into the chamber, and once vessels formed (6–8 d), the
mice were treated with one i.p. dose of 50 mg/kg LFM-A13 or DMSO vehicle control for 1 h followed by 0 or 2 Gy. Microscopic photos were taken daily and the
density of blood vessels was quantified for each treatment group. A, representative photographs. B, columns, mean VLD for each treatment group (n = 3); bars, SE.

Figure 6. Bmx inhibition enhances radiation efficacy in syngeneic homograft
lung cancer model. A, LLCs were treated with DMSO or LFM-A13 before 0, 2, 4,
or 6 Gy irradiation for clonogenic survival assay as performed with HUVEC in
Fig. 3. Surviving colonies were plotted as a fraction of cells plated which was
normalized by the plating efficiency for each condition. Points, mean; bars, SE.
B, LLCs were injected into the hind limb of C57BL6 mice, and tumors were
allowed to form. Animals were separated into four treatment groups: DMSO
vehicle control with sham irradiation (C ), LFM-A13 with sham irradiation (L),
radiation alone (X ), or combined LFM-A13 with radiation (L+X ). Treatments were
given as i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg LFM-A13 45 min before 3 Gy was given daily
for 5 consecutive d. Tumor size was measured and volume was calculated.
Points, tumor volume for each group; bars, SE. Tumor growth delay was
determined for 1.5 cm3 volume time point for each group. P value of 0.027 for

*, P < 0.05; combined arm.

The vascular effects were more pronounced in the in vivo tumor
models. Tumor vascular window blood vessels were minimally
inhibited by 2 Gy or LFM-A13 alone. However, in combination,
LFM-A13 and 2 Gy substantially disrupted tumor blood vessel

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

formation. This antivascular effect was confirmed in hind limb
tumor models that showed that daily LFM-A13 and 3 Gy
significantly affected the tumor microvasculature. Tumor growth
delay was displayed in the combination arm that was more than
additive.
Tec family kinase inhibition has been garnering attention,
although mainly in relation to anti-inflammation. Interestingly,
ImClone has developed a Bmx single chain intrabody system
that can partially attenuate Src transformation potential (37).
Recently, Pan et al. (38) has discovered a number of selective
irreversible Btk inhibitors aimed at treating rheumatoid arthritis.
Moreover, CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has been developing their
own novel Btk inhibitors, cgi1316 and cgi1746, for use in
inflammatory diseases. However, LFM-A13, a rationally designed
inhibitor developed by Parker Hughes Institute, has been
extensively tested in preclinical models. The pharmacokinetics
and toxicity data have been previously published (31), which
provided the basis for the present study. The drug seems to be
well-tolerated based on these murine studies. We have also
tested another commercially available Tec family inhibitor,
terreic acid (33), which seemed to be at least as effective as
LFM-A13 in our in vitro studies (data not shown). However,
because very little is known about in vivo toxicity and
pharmacokinetics for terreic acid, we focused our study on
LFM-A13.
Several lines of evidence point to Bmx as a critical player in
angiogenesis, cell survival, and proliferation, particularly in
response to cancer-promoting factors such as VEGF, epidermal
growth factor, androgens, and Src transformation (16, 18, 25,
39–45). Bmx is activated during cellular stress such as hypoxia
(17, 41, 46, 47) and plays a cytoprotective role (39–45). Bmx
activation up-regulates VEGF expression in endothelial cells, and
VEGF can further activate Bmx in a ‘‘feed forward’’ manner (17).
In addition, several cancers, including prostate (48, 49) and breast
(7, 50), express Bmx that is also active. Other studies show that
Bmx interacts with p53 after DNA damage from chemotherapeutics in a bidirectional inhibitory manner (48). Because a
predominant effect of ionizing radiation is DNA damage, this
interaction may play a role in radiation sensitization by Bmx
inhibitors.
Bmx provides an alternative cell survival pathway to that of
PI3K-Akt signal transduction. It is possible that treatments that
have targeted PI3K-Akt signaling might be deriving some of their
efficacy from concomitant Bmx inhibition. Further studies are
necessary to determine whether Bmx inhibition in combination
with PI3K-Akt blockade will provide additional benefit. Nevertheless, Bmx inhibition remains an attractive potential target for
radiation enhancement because Bmx activation occurs rapidly and
transiently after radiation, such that prolonged Bmx inhibition is
probably not necessary for radiation sensitization to occur. This
hypothesis is consistent with our cell culture assays in which the
drug was removed shortly after irradiation. Therefore, it is possible
that short-acting drug formulations may be effective with radiation
with less systemic effects that typically occur with long-term
administration.
In summary, Bmx is a new molecular target for radiation
sensitization based on in vitro and in vivo experimentation in
vascular endothelium. Ongoing studies using various cancer cell
lines will help us to determine whether certain cancers are more
susceptible to Bmx inhibition when treated with radiation.
Ultimately, clinical evaluation of Bmx inhibitors with radiation
