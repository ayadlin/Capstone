Abstract
The flexible heteroarotinoids (Flex-Het) represent a novel type
of atypical retinoids lacking activity in binding to and
transactivating retinoid receptors. Preclinical studies have
shown that Flex-Hets induce apoptosis of cancer cells while
sparing normal cells and exhibit anticancer activity in vivo
with improved therapeutic ratios over conventional retinoid
receptor agonists. Flex-Hets have been shown to induce
apoptosis through activation of the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway. The present study has revealed a novel mechanism
underlying Flex-Het–induced apoptosis involving induction of
death receptor 5 (DR5). The representative Flex-Het SHetA2
effectively inhibited the growth of human lung cancer cells in
cell culture and in mice. SHetA2 induced apoptosis, which
could be abrogated by silencing caspase-8 expression, indicating that ShetA2 triggers a caspase-8–dependent apoptosis.
Accordingly, SHetA2 up-regulated DR5 expression, including
cell surface levels of DR5, and augmented tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–induced
apoptosis. Importantly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated blockade of DR5 induction conferred cell resistance to
SHetA2-induced apoptosis, as well as SHetA2/TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. These results show that DR5 induction is a key
component of apoptosis induced by SHetA2 or by SHetA2
combined with TRAIL. SHetA2 exerted CAAT/enhancerbinding protein homologous protein (CHOP)–dependent transactivation of the DR5 promoter. Consistently, SHetA2 induced
CHOP expression, which paralleled DR5 up-regulation, whereas
siRNA-mediated blockage of CHOP induction prevented DR5
up-regulation, indicating CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation
by SHetA2. Collectively, we conclude that CHOP-dependent DR5
up-regulation is a key event mediating SHetA2-induced
apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5335–44]

with both therapeutic and chemopreventive potential (1). Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with all-trans retinoic acid
is a successful example (2). However, the exploitation of the full
potential of retinoids as chemopreventive and/or therapeutic
drugs, particularly against solid tumors, has been hampered largely
by their local and systemic toxicity and side effects, which are often
associated with their ability to activate nuclear retinoid receptors
(1, 3). Thus, efforts have been made for the past decades to develop
novel retinoid-like compounds or atypical retinoids, which retain
anticancer activity of retinoids with minimal toxicity and side
effects (3). SHetA2 (see structure in Fig. 1A) is such a compound
because it did not activate retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X
receptor receptors in receptor cotransfection assays and reporter
cell lines (4), rescue or induce embryonic malformations in a
RALDH knockout mouse model (5), or cause skin irritancy in a
murine topical irritancy model (6). Thus, SHetA2 functions independently of retinoid receptors (7, 8). Accordingly, SHetA2 lacks
conventional retinoid toxicities, such as skin irritation or teratogenecity, when tested in animal models (5, 6). However, SHetA2
has the ability to induce differentiation or reverse the cancerous
phenotype (9). Moreover, SHetA2 induces apoptosis in cancer cells
while sparing normal cells (7, 10). Importantly, SHetA2 effectively
inhibits tumor growth in vivo without evidence of toxicity (6).
Because of these encouraging results, SHetA2 was chosen for evaluation in the National Cancer Institute’s Rapid Access to
Intervention Development program (Application 196, compound
NSC 726189) and is now in the Rapid Access to Preventive Intervention Development program, showing a potential as a cancer
chemopreventive and therapeutic agent.
It is well known that there are two major apoptotic pathways:
the extrinsic apoptotic pathway involving signals transduced
through death receptors (DR) and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
relying on signals from the mitochondria. Both pathways involve
the activation of a set of caspases, which in turn cleave cellular
substrates and result in the characteristic morphologic and biochemical changes constituting the process of apoptosis (11, 12).
The extrinsic pathway is characterized by the trimerization of cell
surface DRs and activation of caspase-8, whereas the intrinsic
pathway involves in the disruption of mitochondrial membranes,
the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and the
activation of caspase-9. Through caspase-8–mediated cleavage or
truncation of Bid, the extrinsic DR apoptotic pathway is linked to
the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (11, 12).
The death ligand tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) and its receptors have recently attracted
much attention because TRAIL preferentially induces apoptosis in
transformed or malignant cells while sparing most normal cells,

demonstrating potential as a tumor-selective apoptosis-inducing
cytokine for cancer treatment (13). Currently, both TRAIL and
agonistic antibodies against DR4 or DR5 are being tested in cancer
clinical trials (14). Importantly, certain cancer therapeutic agents
sensitize various types of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced or
agonistic anti-DR4 or DR5 antibody–induced apoptosis (13, 15).
Thus, these agents are useful in combination with TRAIL or an
agonistic anti-DR4 or DR5 antibody to augment induction of
apoptosis. It is well known that TRAIL binds to its receptors: DR4
(also called TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (also named Apo2, TRAIL-R2, or
Killer/DR5) to activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (13).
Both DR4 and DR5 expressions are modulated by some anticancer agents (16), including certain synthetic retinoids (17–23).
As a result, these agents very often can sensitize cancer cells to
TRAIL-induced or agonistic DR4 or DR5 antibody–induced
apoptosis (17, 20, 21). Regulation of DR4 or DR5 occurs through
p53-dependent mechanisms (24–26) and p53-independent mechanisms [e.g., nuclear factor-nB, activator protein 1, and CAAT/
enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP); refs. 23,
27–30]. It has been recently shown that CHOP, also known as
growth arrest and DNA damage gene 153 (GADD153), directly
regulates DR5 expression through a CHOP binding site in the
5-flanking region of the DR5 gene (30, 31). Thus, certain drugs
induce DR5 expression through CHOP-dependent transactivation
of the DR5 gene (30–34).
The mechanism of SHetA2-induced apoptosis has been shown to
occur through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway associated with
loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity, generation of reactive
oxygen species, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria,
and activation of caspase-3 in head and neck cancer cell lines (7).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

Likewise, SHetA2 induces apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells
though targeting the mitochondria associated with alterations in
the balance of Bcl-2 proteins, independent of generation of reactive
oxygen species (10). It seems that the mechanisms of SHetA2
may vary in different types of cancer cells. The present study
investigated the effects of SHetA2 on induction of apoptosis and
examined the underlying mechanism in human non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cells, which are typically insensitive to most of
the conventional retinoids (35). Given that other synthetic atypical
retinoids, such as CD437 and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide
(4HPR), modulate the expression of TRAIL DRs and TRAILinduced apoptosis independent of the retinoid receptors (17–23),
we focused on studying modulation of the extrinsic TRAIL
DR-mediated apoptotic pathway in SHetA2-induced apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. SHetA2 was described previously (6) and dissolved in DMSO
at a concentration of 10 mmol/L, and aliquots were stored at 80jC. Stock
solution was diluted to the appropriate concentrations with growth
medium immediately before use. Human recombinant TRAIL was
purchased from PeproTech, Inc.
Cell lines and cell culture. The human NSCLC cell lines used in this
study were described previously (35). These cell lines were grown in
monolayer culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with glutamine and 5% fetal
bovine serum at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and
95% air.
Cell growth assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well cell culture plates and
treated the next day with the agents indicated. Viable cell number was
estimated using the sulforhodamine B assay, as previously described (35).
Combination index (CI) for drug interaction (e.g., synergy) was calculated
using the CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc.).

SHetA2 Induction of DR5 and Apoptosis
Apoptosis assays. Apoptosis was detected either by analysis of caspase
activation using Western blot analysis as described below or by Annexin V
staining using Annexin V–phycoerythrin (PE) apoptosis detection kit (BD
Bioscience) following the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed by flow
cytometry using the FACScan (Becton Dickinson). In the Annexin V assay,
the percentage of positive cells for Annexin V (PE) staining only in the
bottom right quadrant and for both Annexin V and DNA (7-AAD) staining in
the top right quadrant represents the early and late apoptotic populations,
respectively. The percentage of positive cells for DNA staining only in the
top left quadrant represents the necrotic population.
Western blot analysis. Preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and
Western blot analysis were described previously (36). Mouse anti–caspase-3
monoclonal antibody was purchased from Imgenex. Rabbit polyclonal
antibodies against caspase-8, caspase-9, Bid, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), respectively, were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse anti–caspase-10 monoclonal antibody was purchased from MBL
International. Rabbit polyclonal anti-DR5 antibody was purchased
from ProSci, Inc. Mouse monoclonal anti-DR4 antibody (B-N28) was
purchased from Diaclone. Mouse anti-TRAIL monoclonal antibody was
purchased from Imgenex. Mouse monoclonal anti-CHOP antibody (B-3)
was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti–h-actin
polyclonal antibody and mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody was
purchased from Sigma Chemicals.
Detection of cell surface TRAIL receptors. The procedure for direct
antibody staining and subsequent flow cytometric analysis of cell surface
proteins was described previously (33). The mean fluorescent intensity
(MFI) that represents antigenic density on a per cell basis was used to
represent TRAIL receptor expression level. PE-conjugated mouse antihuman DR5 (DJR2-4), anti-human DR4 (DJR1), anti-human DcR1
(DJR3), and anti-human DcR2 (DJR4-1) monoclonal antibodies and
PE mouse IgG1 isotype control (MOPC-21/P3) were purchased from
eBioscience.
Gene silencing using small interfering RNAs. Silencing of caspase-8,
DR5, and CHOP were achieved by transfecting small interfering RNA
(siRNA) using RNAifect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Control (i.e., nonsilencing), caspase-8, DR5,
and CHOP siRNAs were described previously (33, 37). These siRNAs were
synthesized from Qiagen. Cells were plated in six-well cell culture plates and
transfected the next day with the given siRNAs. After 24 h, the cells were
trypsinized and replated in new plates and, on the second day, treated with

SHetA2, as indicated. Gene silencing effects were evaluated by Western blot,
as described above, after indicated times of treatment.
Construction of DR5 reporter plasmid, transient transfection, and
luciferase activity assay. pGL3-DR5( 552) containing a wild-type CHOP
binding site and pGL3-DR5( 552)CHOPm, in which the CHOP binding site
was mutated, were generously provided by H.G. Wang (University of South
Florida College of Medicine; ref. 30). The pGL3-DR5( 420) and pGL3DR5( 240) reporter construct were described previously (33). The reporter
constructs containing 1,400 and 810 bp 5¶-flanking regions of the DR5
gene upstream of the translation start site, respectively, were amplified by
PCR using the plasmid containing a 5¶-flanking region of DR5 gene provided
by Dr. G.S. Wu (Wayne State University School of Medicine) as a template.
These amplified fragments were then subcloned into pGL3-basic reporter
vector (Promega) through KpnI and BglII restriction sites. In the PCR
amplification, the same reverse primer 5¶-CTTAAGATCTGGCGGTAGGGAACGCTCTTATAGTC-3¶ was used to make these constructs. The
upstream primers were 5¶-CTTAGGTACCGCAATAAATCTTGCTACTGC-3¶
( for 1,400) and 5¶-CTTAGGTACCAGCTACATGGGAGGCTGAGG-3¶ ( for
810), respectively. These constructs were named pGL3-DR5( 1,400) and
pGL3-DR5( 810), respectively. The plasmid transfection and luciferase
assay were the same, as described previously (33).
Lung cancer xenograft and treatments. Animal experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory
University. Four-week-old to 6-wk-old female athymic (nu/nu) mice (f20 g
of body weight) were ordered from Taconic and housed under pathogenfree conditions in microisolator cages with laboratory chow and water
ad libitum. The A549 cells (5  106) in serum-free medium were injected s.c.
into the flank region of nude mice. When tumors reached certain size
ranges (50–100 mm3), the mice were randomized into two groups (n = 6 per
group) according to tumor volumes and body weights for the following
treatments: vehicle control and SHetA2 dissolved in sesame oil (oral gavage;
daily). Tumor volumes were measured using caliper measurements once
every 2 d and calculated with the formula V = (length  width2) / 6.

Results
SHetA2 inhibits the growth of human NSCLC cells in vitro
and in vivo and induces apoptosis. We began our study by
examining the effects of SHetA2 on the growth of a panel of human

transfection, the cells were re-seeded in a
six-well plate or in a 96-well plate. On the
second day, the cells were treated with
DMSO or 10 Amol/L SHetA2 (in the
six-well plate; B) or with the indicated
concentrations of SHetA2 (in the 96-well
plate; C ). After 48 h, the cells were
subjected to preparation of whole-cell
protein lysates and subsequent Western
blot analysis (B) or to an estimation
of cell number using the SRB assay (C).

NSCLC cell lines, which are typically resistant to the conventional
retinoids (35). As presented in Fig. 1B , SHetA2 exhibited
concentration-dependent effects on decreasing the number of
six tested NSCLC cell lines with comparable activity, indicating
that SHetA2 effectively inhibits the growth of human NSCLC cells.
The IC50s, which are the concentrations required for inhibiting
cell growth by 50%, were f2 Amol/L for all these cell lines after
a 3-day exposure. Moreover, we showed that SHetA2 exerted
concentration-dependent effects on increasing apoptotic cell
death of the six NSCLC cell lines after a prolonged treatment
(e.g., 48 h). Among these cell lines, H1299 cells were relatively
less sensitive to SHetA2-induced apoptosis, because SHetA2 at
10 Amol/L induced <20% apoptotic cells (Fig. 1C). In addition to
induction of apoptosis, SHetA2 induced either G1 (e.g., H1299) or
G2-M (e.g., H460, A549, and H157) cell cycle arrest (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Together, these results suggest that SHetA2
inhibits the growth of NSCLC cells through both apoptosis
induction and growth arrest.
Using a A549 xenograft model in nude mice, we found that
SHetA2 significantly inhibited the growth of A549 xenografts
(P < 0.05; Fig. 1D), indicating that SHetA2 also effectively inhibits
the growth of human lung tumors in vivo. We noted that there
was a reduction of mouse body weight (10–15%) during the treatment, suggesting that the current treatment schedule with the
maximal tolerated dose of 60 mg/kg may have some toxicity.
SHetA2 induces caspase-8–dependent apoptosis. To show the
mechanism by which SHetA2 induces apoptosis, we determined

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

the effects of SHetA2 on the activation of intracellular caspase
cascades and its dependence on caspase activation. Procaspase-10
was not detected in H157 and H1299 cells or was not altered in
A549 cells. The levels of procaspase-9 and Bid were decreased in a
dose-dependent manner in both H157 and A549 cell lines, but not
in H1299 cells. Consistently, cleavage of procaspase-8, procaspase3, and PARP was detected in SHetA2-treated H157 and A549 cell
lines, but cleavage of these proteins was not detected or only
minimally detected in SHetA2-treated H1299 cells (Fig. 2A). These
results indicate that both caspase-8–mediated and caspase-9–
mediated caspase cascades are activated during SHetA2-induced
apoptosis. Because caspase-8 activation can result in activation
of the caspase-9–mediated cascade, we questioned whether this
was the case in SHetA-induced apoptosis. To this end, we inhibited
caspase-8 activation by silencing caspase-8 expression using a
caspase-8 siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2B, we detected pro-forms
of caspase-8 and cleaved caspase-8 in control siRNA-transfected
cells, but not in caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells, indicating a
successful silencing of caspase-8 expression. Correspondingly,
we detected cleaved forms of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP in
control siRNA-transfected cells, but not in caspase-8 siRNAtransfected cells. Moreover, the effect of SHetA2 on decreasing
cell number was substantially attenuated in caspase-8 siRNAtransfected cells compared with that in control siRNA-transfected
cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, these results collectively show that SHetA2
induces caspase-8–dependent apoptosis. In addition, caspase-9
activation induced by SHetA2 is secondary to caspase-8 activation.

SHetA2 Induction of DR5 and Apoptosis

SHetA2 up-regulates DR5 expression. Given that caspase-8
activation plays a critical role in mediating the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway, we next asked whether SHetA2 activates the DR-mediated
apoptotic pathway. Therefore, we examined the effects of SHetA2
on the expression of DR5, DR4, and their ligand TRAIL. As
presented in Fig. 3A, SHetA2 at 5 or 10 Amol/L increased the levels
of DR5 protein in all the tested cells lines. Under the same
conditions, SHetA2 did not increase DR4 expression; interestingly,
SHetA2 even decreased the levels of DR4 protein in some cell lines
(e.g., A549 and H1792). We failed to detect the basal levels of TRAIL
or increase in TRAIL expression in H460, H157, H1299, and H1792
cells. In cell lines that did express TRAIL (e.g., A549 and Calu-1),
SHetA2 either did not alter TRAIL levels (e.g., A549) or decreased
TRAIL expression (e.g., Calu-1). A time course analysis of DR5

expression in cells exposed to SHetA2 showed that DR5 upregulation occurred 4 hours post–SHetA2 treatment and was
sustained up to 24 hours (Fig. 3B). Given that functional DR5 and
other TRAIL receptors are located on the cell surface, we further
analyzed cell surface TRAIL receptor distributions in cells exposed
to SHetA2. All three tested cell lines (i.e., H157, A549, and H1299)
expressed basal levels of DR5 and DR4. Upon SHetA2 treatment,
surface DR5 but DR4 levels were further increased. The MFIs of
DR5 were 25 and 43 in DMSO-treated and SHetA2-treated H157
cells, respectively; 26 and 45, respectively, in A549 cells; and 11 and
27, respectively, in H1299 cells (Fig. 3C). In H1299 cells, we found
that SHetA2 actually decreased the levels of cell surface DR4. The
MFIs of DR4 in H1299 cells were 20 in DMSO-treated cells and 12 in
SHetA2-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Cell surface DcR1 and DcR2 were

not or only minimally detected in these three cell lines and not
increased by SHetA2 (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results indicate
that SHetA2 primarily up-regulates DR5 expression, including cell
surface DR5 levels in human NSCLC cells.
SHetA2 cooperates with TRAIL to augment induction of
apoptosis. If SHetA2-induced DR5 is functional, we speculated
that inclusion of exogenous recombinant TRAIL in SHetA2
treatment would result in enhanced apoptosis induction. To test
this hypothesis, we treated four NSCLC cell lines (i.e., H1299,
Calu-1, A549, and H157) with SHetA2 alone, TRAIL alone, or both
drugs combined and then assessed cell survival and apoptosis. As
presented in Fig. 4A, the combination of SHetA2 at concentrations
of 2.5 to 10 Amol/L with either dose of TRAIL (20 or 40 ng/mL) was
much more effective in decreasing tumor cell number than either
single agent alone. For example, in Calu-1 cells, both SHetA2 alone
at 5 Amol/L and TRAIL (20 ng/mL) alone decreased cell number by
f30%, but the combination of the two agents reduced cell number
by >80%, which is greater than the sum of the effects of each agent
alone. The CIs for these combinations in all four cell lines were

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

smaller than 1 (Fig. 4B), indicating that the combination of SHetA2
and TRAIL synergistically decreases cell survival. Moreover, we
used Annexing V staining to detect apoptosis in three NSCLC cell
lines (A549, H157, and H460) exposed to the combination of
SHetA2 and TRAIL. During a 24-hour treatment, the SHetA2 and
TRAIL combination was much more effective than each of the
single agents alone in increasing apoptosis (Fig. 4C). For example,
in H157 cells, 10 Amol/L SHetA2 alone and 20 ng/mL TRAIL alone
induced f14% and 17% apoptosis, respectively; however, their
combination caused f54% of cells to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 4C).
By Western blotting, we also detected the strongest bands of
cleaved caspases and PARP or the most reduction of procaspases
and PARP in cells exposed to the combination of SHetA2 and
TRAIL in comparison with those cells treated with SHetA2 or
TRAIL alone (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these results clearly indicate
that SHetA2 synergizes with TRAIL to augment induction of
apoptosis in human NSCLC cells.
Induction of DR5 expression is required for SHetA2-induced
apoptosis and augmentation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To

SHetA2 Induction of DR5 and Apoptosis

show the role of DR5 up-regulation in SHetA2-induced apoptosis
and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we blocked DR5
induction through siRNA-mediated silencing of DR5 expression
and examined its effect on the ability of SHetA2 to trigger
apoptosis and to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As shown in
Fig. 5A, in both H157 and A549 cells, DR5 siRNA transfection
dramatically decreased basal levels of DR5 expression and, more
importantly, abolished SHetA2-induced DR5 expression as detected
by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). As a result, the cleavage of
casapse-8, caspase-3, and PARP were substantially inhibited in cells
transfected with DR5 siRNA, compared with control siRNAtransfected cells (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, SHetA2 had attenuated
effects on decreasing cell number in DR5 siRNA-transfected cells
compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5B). Consistently, we detected less apoptotic cells (f25%) in DR5 siRNAtransfected cells than in cells transfected with control siRNA
(f45%; Fig. 5C). Collectively, these results indicate that DR5
induction is required for SHetA2-induced apoptosis.
In addition, we examined the effect of siRNA-mediated blockage
of DR5 induction on cooperative induction of apoptosis by the
combination of SHetA2 and TRAIL. As shown in Fig. 5D, the
combination of SHetA2 and TRAIL induced f46% apoptosis in
control siRNA-transfected cells but only 23% apoptosis in DR5

siRNA-transfected cells, indicating that DR5 induction is also
important for cooperative induction of apoptosis by the SHetA2
and TRAIL combination.
SHetA2-induced DR5 up-regulation is CHOP dependent. To
understand how SHetA2 up-regulates DR5 expression, we examined the effects of SHetA2 on the transactivation of reporter
constructs with different lengths of DR5 5¶-flanking regions
to identify the region responsible for SHetA2-mediated DR5
transactivation. In a transient transfection and luciferase assay,
SHetA2 minimally increased the luciferase activity of pGL3DR5( 240) while drastically increasing the luciferase activity
of pGL3-DR5( 420), pGL3-DR5( 810), and pGL3-DR5( 1400)
(Fig. 6A, left), indicating that the region between 240 and 420
contains essential element(s) responsible for SHetA2-induced DR5
transactivation. There is a CHOP binding site in this region, which
has been shown to be responsible for DR5 up-regulation by several
anticancer agents (30–32). Thus, we further compared the effects of
SHetA2 on the transactivation of reporter constructs carrying wildtype and mutated CHOP binding sites, respectively. As presented in
Fig. 6A (right), SHetA2 increased the luciferase activity of the
constructs carrying the wild-type DR5 promoter region, but did not
increase the luciferase activity of the construct carrying the DR5
promoter region with the mutated CHOP binding site. These results

CHOP-dependent up-regulation of DR5 is
important for SHetA2 to regulate the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway, including
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This effect may
eventually cooperate with other
mechanisms, e.g., effects on the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway (dashed lines ), to fully
activate apoptosis of cancer cells.

clearly indicate that the CHOP binding site in the DR5 promoter
region is responsible for SHetA2-mediated DR5 transactivation.
We next determined whether SHetA2 increased CHOP levels and,
if so, whether CHOP is responsible for DR5 induction. By Western
blot analysis, we detected a time-dependent DR5 induction accompanied by CHOP up-regulation in cells exposed to SHetA2, both
of which occurred at 4 hours and were sustained up to 12-hour
post–SHetA2 treatment (Fig. 6B, top). Moreover, we blocked
SHetA2-induced CHOP expression using CHOP siRNA to see if
blockage of CHOP induction abrogated the ability of SHetA2 to
up-regulate DR5 expression. Indeed, blockage of the effect of
SHetA2 on CHOP induction also abrogated the ability of SHetA2 to
up-regulate DR5 expression in cells transfected with CHOP siRNA
(Fig. 6B, bottom). Thus, these results clearly indicate that SHetA2induced DR5 up-regulation is secondary to CHOP induction.
Collectively, we conclude that SHetA2 induces a CHOP-dependent
DR5 expression.
SHetA2 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. It is well
known that CHOP is one of the highest inducible genes during
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a critical component of ER
stress-induced apoptosis (38, 39). To determine whether SHetA2
induces ER stress, resulting in CHOP up-regulation, we further
examined modulation of other featured proteins (e.g., Bip/GRP78,
IRE1a, eIF2a, ATF4, and XBP1) of ER stress (39, 40) in cells exposed
to SHetA2. As presented in Fig. 6C, SHetA2 increased the levels of
Bip/GRP78, IRE1a, ATF4, and XBP1 in a time-dependent manner in
both A549 and H157 cells, which occurred early at 2 hours and
were sustained up to 12 hours. In addition, we found that SHetA2
weakly increased levels of p-eIF2a in these cell lines. However,
these effects were transient because SHetA2 increased p-eIF2a
levels only at early times (e.g., 2 hours). Collectively, these results
suggest that SHetA2 induces ER stress in human NSCLC cells.

Discussion
By studying the effects of SHetA2 on the growth of human
NSCLC cells, the present study has shown that SHetA2 effectively
inhibits the growth of human NSCLC cells through induction of
both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Importantly, SHetA2
significantly inhibits the growth of human lung cancer xenografts
in nude mice. Thus, our results show the efficacy of SHetA2 for
treatment of lung cancer and thereby warrant further evaluation of
SHetA2 as a potential anticancer agent against lung cancer. We
noted that, upon SHetA2 treatment, H1299 cells, which are the least
sensitive to induction of apoptosis, primarily underwent G1 arrest,
whereas H460, A549 and H157 cells, which are relatively sensitive to
induction of apoptosis, underwent G2-M arrest. Whether G1 arrest
confers apoptosis resistance to SHetA2 in H1299 cells needs further
investigation.
In this study, we found that SHetA2 increased cleavage of
both caspase-8 and caspase-9. Importantly, silencing of caspase-8
using the caspase-8 siRNA abrogated SHetA2-induced cleavage
of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP and attenuated the ability of
SHetA2 to decrease the survival of lung cancer cells (Fig. 2).
Thus, we conclude that SHetA2 induces caspase-8–dependent
apoptosis. Given that silencing of caspase-8 prevents caspase-9
from activation, it seems that caspase-9 activation is secondary to
caspase-8 activation during SHetA2-induced apoptosis. It has been
shown that SHetA2 activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
in other types of cancer cells (8, 10). In our study, we also observed
the cleavage of Bid, a caspase-8 substrate that mediates caspase-8–

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

dependent activation of mitochondrial apoptosis, in SHetA2treated cells. Thus, it is likely that SHetA2 induces apoptosis
through activation of caspase-8 followed by activation of the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway involving cleavage of caspase-9
and caspase-3.
Moreover, we also found that SHetA2 up-regulated DR5
expression, including cell surface DR5 levels without increasing
the expression of DR4, DcR1, and DcR2, as well as their ligand
TRAIL (Fig. 3), suggesting that DR5 up-regulation may be
important for SHetA2-induced caspase-8 activation and apoptosis.
When combined with recombinant TRAIL, SHetA2 exerted
augmented effects on induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4), suggesting
that SHetA2-induced DR5 is functional. Moreover, siRNA-mediated
blockade of DR5 induction attenuated the ability of SHetA2 to
activate caspases, including caspase-8, to decrease cell survival,
to induce apoptosis, and to augment induction of apoptosis
when combined with TRAIL (Fig. 5). These results provide robust
evidence for a critical role of DR5 up-regulation in mediating
SHetA2-induced, caspase-8–dependent apoptosis, as well as
cooperative induction of apoptosis by the SHetA2 and TRAIL
combination. These findings indicate that SHetA2 is distinct from
4HPR, which induces caspase-8–dependent apoptosis independent
of DRs (41). We noted that SHetA2 actually decreased the levels of
DR4 and TRAIL in some cell lines. The underlying mechanism and
their biological significance are currently unknown and need
further investigation.
DR5 expression can be regulated through p53-dependent and
p53-independent mechanisms (26, 42). In our study, SHetA2
induced DR5 expression in all of the tested human NSCLC cell
lines (Fig. 3), among which only H460 and A549 have wild-type p53
gene (22, 25). Thus, it is likely that SHetA2 induces DR5 expression
independent of p53. Recently, CHOP has been shown to regulate
DR5 expression through the CHOP binding site in the DR5 gene
(30, 31), revealing an important DR5 regulation mechanism. In our
study, SHetA2 increased DR5 promoter activity, suggesting that
DR5 induction occurs at the transcriptional level. The deletion and
mutation analysis of the DR5 5¶-flanking region revealed that the
region containing the CHOP binding site is essential for SHetA2mediated DR5 transactivation (Fig. 6). Moreover, SHetA2 induced
a time-dependent CHOP expression, which was accompanied by
the up-regulation of DR5 expression. Blockage of SHetA2-mediated
CHOP induction by the CHOP siRNA accordingly inhibited DR5
up-regulation (Fig. 6). Collectively, we conclude that SHetA2
induces DR5 expression through a CHOP-dependent mechanism.
It has been suggested that p53 regulates CHOP expression (43).
In our study, SHetA2 increased CHOP expression in both p53
wild-type cells (e.g., A549) and p53 mutant cells (e.g., H157) in a
similar fashion to DR5 up-regulation. Thus, it seems that SHetA2
induces CHOP independent of p53.
It is well known that CHOP is a featured ER stress-regulated
protein involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis (38). Thus, our
finding on CHOP induction by SHetA2 suggests that SHetA2
triggers ER stress. Indeed, SHetA2 increased the levels of Bip,
IRE1a, p-eIF2a, ATF4, and XBP1 (Fig. 6), all of which are additional
featured proteins accumulated or increased during ER stress
(39, 40). Therefore, it seems that SHetA2 induces ER stress in
NSCLC cells. Several studies have shown that 4HPR induces CHOP
expression and ER stress, which are important for 4HPR-induced
apoptosis (44–47). A recent study actually showed that 4HPR
induces CHOP-dependent DR5 expression (17). In this regard, it
seems that SHetA2 and 4HPR share similarities. Our preliminary

data show that cyclohexamide, an inhibitor of general protein
synthesis that can decrease the overall protein burden, but not
salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2a dephosphorylation that can
protect cell from ER stress-induced apoptosis through temporary
slow down of the global protein translation (48), abolished SHetA2induced CHOP expression (see Supplementary Fig. S2). These
results suggest that blockage of eIF2a-mediated protein translation
is not sufficient to prevent CHOP induction by SHetA2, although
eIF2a-signaling pathway is critical for CHOP induction in ER stress
(38). Nevertheless, the relationship between ER stress and CHOP
induction, as well as apoptosis by SHetA2, needs further
investigation.
In practice, our findings that SHetA2 increases DR5 expression
and enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis have meaningful implications. Given the therapeutic potential of TRAIL and agonistic DR5
antibodies, both of which are being tested in phase I clinical trials,
SHetA2 can be used in combination with TRAIL or an agonistic
anti-DR5 antibody to achieve an enhanced cancer therapeutic
effect through augmenting induction of apoptosis of human cancer
cells.
In summary, our study has shown that the novel synthetic
atypical retinoid compound SHetA2 effectively inhibits the growth
of human NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo. For the first time,

we have shown that SHetA2 triggers ER stress and induces CHOPdependent DR5 expression, leading to caspase-8–dependent
apoptosis. Given that SHetA2 also activates the intrinsic apoptotic
pathways, as shown in other studies, we suggest that the intrinsic
and extrinsic pathways may be simultaneously activated by an
initiating stress induced by the drug or by cross-talk between the
extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways (Fig. 6D).
