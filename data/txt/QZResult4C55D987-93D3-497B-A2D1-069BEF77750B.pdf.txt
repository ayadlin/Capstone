Abstract
Despite our improved understanding of cancer, the 5-year survival rate for head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC) patients remains relatively unchanged at 50% for the past three decades. HNSCCs often
metastasize to locoregional lymph nodes, and lymph node involvement represents one of the most important
prognostic factors of poor clinical outcome. Among the multiple dysregulated molecular mechanism in HNSCCs,
emerging basic, preclinical, and clinical ﬁndings support the importance of the mTOR signaling route in HNSCC
progression. Indeed, we observed here that the activation of mTOR is a widespread event in clinical specimens of
HNSCCs invading locoregional lymph nodes. We developed an orthotopic model of HNSCC consisting of the
implantation of HNSCC cells into the tongues of immunocompromised mice. These orthotopic tumors
spontaneously metastasize to the cervical lymph nodes, where the presence of HNSCC cells can be revealed
by histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. Both primary and metastatic experimental HNSCC lesions
exhibited elevated mTOR activity. The ability to monitor and quantitate lymph node invasion in this model system
enabled us to explore whether the blockade of mTOR could impact HNSCC metastasis. We found that inhibition
of mTOR with rapamycin and the rapalog RAD001 diminished lymphangiogenesis in the primary tumors and
prevented the dissemination of HNSCC cancer cells to the cervical lymph nodes, thereby prolonging animal
survival. These ﬁndings may provide a rationale for the future clinical evaluation of mTOR inhibitors, including
rapamycin and its analogues, as part of a molecular-targeted metastasis preventive strategy for the treatment of
patients with HNSCC. Cancer Res; 71(22); 7103–12. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
With approximately 500,000 new cases per year worldwide
(1) and more than 11,000 expected deaths in 2009 in the United
States alone (2), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) ranks sixth among the most common cancers in the
world (3). Despite clear advancements in our understanding of
cancer as a disease, the 5-year survival rate for HNSCC remains
relatively unchanged at 50% for the past 3 decades (2, 3).

Several important factors contribute to this bleak scenario,
including late presentation and consequent delay in the diagnosis of HNSCC lesions, concomitant with the limited availability of effective therapeutic options to reduce the morbidity
and mortality of advanced HNSCC cases (4–7). In this regard,
the head and neck region includes a large fraction of all the
lymph nodes of the human body, and with this rich lymphatic
system, HNSCC has a high propensity to metastasize to locoregional lymph nodes (5, 8–12). Even in patients with no clinical
evidence of lymph nodal metastasis (N0), the incidence of
occult metastasis ranges from 10% to 50% (8–11), and the
status of cervical lymph node metastasis is often considered
the single most important prognostic factor in HNSCCs, with
the presence of lymph node involvement decreasing the overall
survival rate by nearly 50% (5, 9, 12).
Of interest, among the multiple molecular mechanism dysregulated in HNSCCs, emerging basic, preclinical, and clinical
ﬁndings support the importance of Akt/mTOR signaling route
in HNSCC progression (reviewed in ref. 7). Indeed, activation of
mTOR and Akt, the latter acting upstream from mTOR, has
been observed in more than 80% of all HNSCC lesions (6) often
correlating with poor prognosis (13, 14). The activation of
mTOR can result from the enhanced expression and activity
of epidermal growth factor receptors that characterize HNSCC
(15), as well as by the overexpression or the presence of

activating mutations in the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase a (16) or the decreased expression of the PIP3
phosphatase PTEN (17). Furthermore, interfering with mTOR
activity in its complex 1 (mTORC1) by the use of speciﬁc
inhibitors, such as rapamycin (sirolimus) and its analogues
(e.g., CCI-779, also known as temsirolimus, and RAD001,
known as everolimus), has been shown to provoke the rapid
regression of HNSCC tumor xenografts (18), to prevent tumor
regrowth in a minimal residual HNSCC xenograft model (19),
and to decrease tumor burden and the malignant conversion
of potential HNSCC precancerous lesions in multiple genetically deﬁned and chemically induced animal models of HNSCC
(20–22). These observations prompted us to examine whether
mTOR is activated in human HNSCC lymph nodes metastasis
and whether blocking mTOR prevents the metastatic spread
of primary HNSCC lesions. We show here that the activation
of mTOR is a widespread event in clinical specimens of
HNSCCs invading locoregional lymph nodes. Furthermore,
the prolonged treatment with rapamycin and RAD001 diminished the dissemination of HNSCC cancer cells to the cervical
lymph nodes in a newly developed orthotopic HNSCC model,
thereby prolonging animal survival. Thus, the use of mTOR
inhibitors may represent a novel molecular-targeted approach
for metastasis prevention in patients with HNSCC.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents and cell culture
All chemicals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich,
unless indicated. UMSCC2 and UMSCC17B cells were cultured
as previously described (23, 24) in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Media supplemented with 10% FBS, at 37 C in 95% air/5% CO2,
and both cell lines underwent DNA authentication (Genetica
DNA Laboratories, Inc.) prior to the described experiments
to ensure consistency in cell identity.
Establishment and treatment of orthotopic tumor
xenografts in SCID/NOD mice
All animal studies were carried out according to NIHapproved protocols (ASP# 10-569), in compliance with the
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID)/NOD mice (NCI),
4 to 6 weeks of age and weighing 18 to 20 g were used in the
study, were housed in appropriate sterile ﬁlter-capped cages,
and fed and watered ad libitum. All cell and animal handling
and tumor transplantation into the tongue are described in
detail in Supplementary Material. Brieﬂy, all animals bearing
orthotopic HNSCC tumors underwent weekly evaluation of
the tongue for disease onset, and the observed lesions were
assessed for length and width, and tumor volume was determined as described previously (18). Animals were euthanized
at the indicated time points and the cervical lymph nodes
assessed for evidence of metastases.
Histopathologic and immunohistologic analysis
For histopathology, after ﬁxing, each tongue was cut into 4
sections of approximately the same thickness, following its
major axis (20), and tissue processing, immunohistochemical

analysis, image acquisition, and staining quantiﬁcation were
conducted as described in Supplementary Material. Masson
trichrome staining was carried out on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded tissues as previously described (25).
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni or Newman–
Keuls multiple comparison tests was used to analyze the
differences of tumor mass volume between experimental
groups and differences between immunohistochemical quantiﬁcation of each group. The Mann–Whitney test was used to
evaluate differences in total tumor area. Data analysis were
done using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software); values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant for each analysis as described in detail in Supplementary Material.

Results
As we have previously reported, the activation of mTOR is a
widespread event in HNSCC, as judged by the immunohistochemical analysis of the presence of the phospho-serine ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) in representative human HNSCC tissue
sections (Fig. 1A). These tumors are highly angiogenic, as
revealed by the use of the vascular endothelial marker CD31
showing blood vessels within the stroma adjacent to the
tumoral mass positive for pS6 (Fig. 1A). Most human HNSCC
lesions are also highly lymphangiogenic (26), reﬂected by the
presence of intratumoral lymphatic vessels staining positive
for lymphatic vessel endothelia receptor 1 (LYVE-1). Indeed,
the microvessel densities of vascular and lymphatic vessels
were comparable when analyzing consecutive tissue sections
of a representative group of HNSCC lesions (n ¼ 5; Fig. 1B). Of
interest, the presence of active mTOR was also clearly observed
in the epithelial cells of all human-invaded HNSCC lymph
nodes analyzed (n ¼ 8); only isolated lymphocytic subpopulations showed cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in normal, noninvaded areas in human lymph nodes (Fig. 1C). Similarly,
we also observed elevated levels of the serine 473 phosphorylated form of Akt (pAktS473), a downstream target of mTOR
in its complex mTORC2 (27), in most tumor cells from all
invaded lymph nodes evaluated (n ¼ 8; Fig. 1C). All malignant
cells displaying elevated pS6 and pAktS473 in invading tumors
were of epithelial origin, as revealed by staining adjacent
tissue sections for human cytokeratins (Fig. 1C).
To begin addressing whether molecular-targeted approaches could be used to prevent the spread of HNSCC to
locoregional lymph nodes, we took advantage of the availability of highly invasive HNSCC cells to develop an orthotopic model of HNSCC metastasis. Few metastatic models
are currently available in which lymph node metastases
develop, albeit with limited efﬁciency (28–30). In particular,
the evaluation of a large panel of HNSCC-derived cells led
to the identiﬁcation of 2 highly invasive human HNSCC
cell lines, UMSCC2 and UMSCC17B. When orthotopically
injected into the tongue of SCID/NOD mice, these HNSCC
cells grew as highly aggressive tumors, invading the muscle
and all surrounding tissues. For example, intraepithelial

(Fig. 2A and B for UMSCC2 cells and Supplementary Fig. S1A
and S1B for UMSCC17B). Remarkably, these HNSCC cells
also invaded the nerves and local lymph nodes, with visible
tumor masses growing inside the lymphatic vessels (Fig. 2C
and D and Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). These tumors
are highly lymphangiogenic, reﬂecting a characteristic displayed by most human HNSCC lesions (26). Intratumoral
lymphatic vessels staining positive for LYVE-1 were visible
within the tumoral mass (Fig. 2E and Supplementary
Fig. S1E). The adjacent muscle, which has extensive lymphatic networks, served as a positive control. These tumors
are also highly angiogenic, as revealed by CD31 staining.

This enabled us to identify lymphatic drainage to 4 to 5
readily resectable cervical lymph nodes. Indeed, the metastatic spread of HNSCC cells growing orthotopically into the
tongue could be visualized in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)stained lymph node sections as compared with noninvaded
lymph nodes (Fig. 3C–E and Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2D).
Nearly, all mice in the initial cohorts had at least one or more
invaded lymph nodes when sacriﬁced 40 days after tumor
implantation into the tongue (Fig. 3F and Supplementary
Fig. S2E). This provided a simple and quantitative approach
to examine the yet-to-be-identiﬁed factors contributing
to lymph node metastasis and to attempt to halt this lifethreatening process. Noninvaded lymph preserved their rich
cortical network of normal lymphatic vessels (Fig. 3G and

In normal murine oral mucosa and skin, mTOR is activated
in the suprabasal layers lacking proliferative capacity, as
judged by the accumulation pS6 (Fig. 4A and Supplementary

pS6 throughout (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Similarly, the invaded lymph nodes displayed high levels of pS6;

activity (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Thus, both
experimental and human HNSCC metastatic lesions are characterized by the presence of active mTOR pathway. Rapamycin
and RAD001, which block mTOR in its complex mTORC1 (27),
abolished the detection of pS6-positive cells in the primary
tumor site and invaded lymph nodes after its administration
to orthotopic tumor–bearing mice (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D), conﬁrming that the accumulation of pS6 reﬂects the aberrant activity of mTOR in these
tumoral lesions. Interestingly, rapamycin and RAD001 also
reduced pAktS473 levels in the primary tongue lesions and their

mTORC2 activity in HNSCC, likely indirectly, as observed after
prolonged treatment with rapamycin of cultured cells (31).
These observations prompted us to explore the consequences of treating mice harboring HNSCC tumors with
rapamycin and RAD001. Treatment was initiated approximately 10 days after tumor implantation into the tongue when
primary tumors were visible in all mice. As shown in Fig. 5A–D

and Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4D, the impact of rapamycin
treatment was remarkable. Weekly tongue evaluation revealed a signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition caused by rapamycin
and RAD001 administration (Fig. 5A and Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Typical examples of tumor-bearing mice treated
with vehicle control, rapamycin, and RAD001 for approximately 2 to 3 weeks are depicted (Fig. 5B and Supplementary

as it prevented intratumoral lymphangiogenesis without perturbing the normal distribution of lymphatic vessels in the
oral mucosa and muscle (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S5E).
Aligned with this observation, rapamycin inhibits potently the
proliferation of human lymphatic endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). On the other hand, the ability to monitor
and quantitate lymph node invasion in this model system
enabled us to explore whether the blockade of mTOR with
rapamycin could impact HNSCC metastasis. As shown
in Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig. S5F, rapamycin and RAD001
treatment caused a remarkable decrease in the number of
invaded lymph nodes, which was reﬂected in a signiﬁcant
increase in the overall survival of all rapamycin- and RAD001treated animals (Fig. 6G and Supplementary Fig. S5G).

Newly gained molecular understanding of HNSCC initiation
and tumor evolution may soon afford the opportunity to delay
or halt tumor progression. In this regard, among the multiple
aberrant genetic, epigenetic, and signaling events known to
occur in HNSCCs, the persistent activation of the Akt/mTOR
pathway has emerged as potential drug target for HNSCC
treatment. As supported by extensive preclinical investigation,
the use of mTOR inhibitors, including rapamycin (sirolimus)
and its analogues, CCI-779 (temserolimus), and RAD001 (everolimus), can dramatically reduce tumor burden and even
recurrence in HNSCC tumor xenografts and in chemically
induced and genetically deﬁned animal models recapitulating
HNSCC initiation and progression (18–22). Furthermore,
recent clinical evaluation of temserolimus as neoadjuvant
prior to deﬁnitive treatment has revealed that all predicted
biochemical targets for mTOR inhibitors in this tumor type are
hit in the clinical setting, at clinically relevant doses and with

limited side effects, resulting in cancer cell apoptosis and
tumor shrinkage (32). We now show that activation of the
mTOR pathway is a frequent event in human metastatic
HNSCC lesions. Furthermore, by the use of an orthotopic
model of HNSCC in which the local tumoral invasion and
lymph node metastasis can be readily assessed, we now show
that mTOR inhibition with rapamycin can reduce tumoral
growth in the tongue, one of its most frequent sites. As the
immune system plays an important role in tumor metastasis,
the implantation of human HNSCC cells in immunodeﬁcient
mice may not reﬂect the clinical situation fully. While keeping
this potential limitation in mind, this orthotopic animal model
revealed that the treatment with rapamycin prevents the
metastatic spread of the HNSCC lesions, thereby prolonging
animal survival.
The blockade of mTOR in experimental and clinical HNSCC
lesions leads to a rapid decrease in the phosphorylated state of
S6 and 4EBP1 (18, 20, 32), 2 downstream targets of the mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1; ref. 27), which also serves as a biomarker

Figure 6. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin and RAD001 prevents the metastatic spread of primary HNSCC lesions to cervical lymph nodes, extending animal
survival. A, patterns of tumor regression in rapamycin- and RAD001-treated UMSCC2 HNSCC xenografts. After rapamycin treatment, the remnant tumor has
become lobulated, with blocks of neoplastic cells divided by dense collagen strands. Similar results were observed in RAD001-treated animals (not shown).
In the H&E-stained tissue (inset), the collagen is evident by an increase in eosinophilic material between the cells. The small images on the right are higher

be identiﬁed within the tumoral mass (arrowheads). At bottom, intercellular edema and hemorrhages are evident. B–D, the increase in blue-stained
collagen bands is evident in the rapamycin- and RAD001-treated animal (C and D, respectively) as compared with the vehicle-treated mouse (B). Masson

decrease of lymphatic vessel density speciﬁcally within the tumor area, as judged by LYVE-1 staining (   , P < 0.001). F, percentage of metastatic lymph

for the validation of the biochemical activity of mTOR inhibitors in their target tissues. In HNSCCs, rapamycin also causes a
rapid decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt in serine 473
(18–20), a target for mTORC2 (27), suggesting that, as shown
in cultured cell systems (31), prolonged exposure to rapamycin and its analogues can reduce mTORC2 activity, likely
by an indirect, yet unknown mechanism. Similarly, we have
observed a rapid blockade of mTORC2 in the HNSCC orthotopic model system, as judged by decreased levels of pAktS473.

This effect could contribute to the antimetastatic activity of
rapamycin, as mTORC2 is known to be involved in polarized
cell migration in multiple cell types and even in model organisms (33, 34). Thus, the blockade of mTORC2 in HNSCCs might
result in reduced migration of cancer cells toward chemoattractants often implicated in HNSCC metastasis, a possibility
that is under current investigation.
Of interest, melanoma and HNSCCs are one of the few
cancers in which intratumoral lymphangiogenesis is known

Rapamycin Prevents Lymphangiogenesis and Metastasis in HNSCC

to occur (35). Aligned with these observations, although angiogenesis is a frequent event in HNSCC models, we noticed the
formation of a remarkable network of intratumoral lymphatic
vessels in the primary tumor site, which was only observed
in the orthotopic HNSCC system but not when tumors were
implanted in other anatomic locations. The release of multiple
lymphangiogenic growth factors by HNSCCs and stromal
cells within the tumoral microenvironment in the tongue
may account for this remarkable prolymphangiogenic activity
of orthotopically implanted HNSCC cells and their metastatic
potential (36–41), an issue that warrants further investigation.
We also observed the growth of invading HNSCC cells within
the lymphatic vessels, together suggesting that HNSCC cancer
cells can promote the growth and recruitment of lymphatic
endothelial cells or their progenitors and support their survival within the tumor microenvironment. This was nearly
completely prevented by rapamycin and RAD001 treatment,
supporting an antilymphangiogenic function of mTOR inhibitors when administered to mice bearing tumors in their natural
microenvironment. This effect likely involves the impact of
these rapalogs on mTOR function in the tumor cells and/or in
the lymphatic endothelial cells, hence preventing lymphangiogenic signaling. While these possibilities are under investigation, we can conclude that our ﬁndings support a unique
antilymphangiogenic function of mTOR inhibitors, which
could have multiple beneﬁcial clinical implications. Indeed,
while further work may be required to deﬁne precisely how
mTOR inhibitors act in HNSCC, the emerging information
suggests that rapamycin may exert its antitumoral activity at
multiple steps, reducing the growth and size of the primary
tumor, preventing the formation of intratumoral lymphatic
vessels, and likely reducing the migratory activity of HNSCC
cells toward the lymph nodes, thus preventing the locoregional
metastatic spread of primary HNSCC lesions.
Among the factors inﬂuencing patient outcome, the presence of lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis

represents the most important factor predicting a poor
prognosis (5, 9–12). Unfortunately, tumor recurrence in
successfully treated patients with HNSCC is a frequent
event, often accompanied with metastatic disease even in
prior lymph node–negative cases (42). Indeed, patients
with HNSCC often succumb to metastatic disease, compromising both quality of life and overall life expectancy.
Unfortunately, there are still limited therapeutic options to
prevent disease progression and locoregional and distant
HNSCC spread. In this regard, the emerging preclinical and
clinical information about the promising beneﬁcial effects
of mTOR inhibitors in HNSCCs and our present ﬁndings
can now be exploited to prevent HNSCC recurrence and
metastasis. Speciﬁcally, we can envision that the present
study and prior reports may provide a rationale for the
future clinical evaluation of rapamycin and its analogues in
an adjuvant setting, as part of a molecular-targeted strategy
for metastasis prevention after deﬁnitive treatment.
