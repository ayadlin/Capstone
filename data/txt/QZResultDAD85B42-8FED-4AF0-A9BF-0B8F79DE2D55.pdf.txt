ABSTRACT
Cabergoline (CAB), the first-line drug for treatment of prolactinomas, is effective
in suppressing prolactin hypersecretion, reducing tumor size, and restoring gonadal
function. However, mechanisms for CAB-mediated tumor shrinkage are largely
unknown. Here we report a novel cytotoxic mechanism for CAB. CAB induced formation
of autophagosome in rat pituitary tumor MMQ and GH3 cells at the early stage through
inhibiting mTOR pathway, resulting in higher conversion rates of LC3-I to LC3-II,
GFP-LC3 aggregation, and increased autophagosome formation. Interestingly, CAB
treatment augmented lysosome acidification and resulted in impaired proteolytic
degradation within autolysosomes. This blocked the autophagic flux, leading to
the accumulation of p62 aggregation and undigested autolysosomes. Knockdown
of ATG7, ATG5, or Becn1, could significantly rescue the CAB-mediated cell death
of MMQ cells (p < 0.05). CAB-induced autophagy and blockade of autophagy flux
participated in antitumoral action in vivo. In conclusion, our study provides evidence
that CAB concomitantly induces autophagy and inhibits the autophagic flux, leading
to autophagy-dependent cell death. These findings elucidate novel mechanisms for
CAB action.

and ACTH-secreting adenomas [9], making it a valuable
therapeutic drug for pituitary adenomas.
A large body of evidence indicates that DA selectively
activates cell surface dopamine 2 receptors (D2R), leading
to the suppressed transcription and expression of the PRL
gene as well as to decreased synthesis and secretion of
PRL [1, 2, 10]. In addition, DA, BRC, and CAB activate
the short isoform of D2R (D2S) and induce apoptosis
[11–14]. We showed that transfection with D2S expressing
adenovirus sensitizes GH3 xenografts to BRC treatment
in nude mice, as evidenced by increase in apoptosis with
an activation of caspase-3 [15]. CAB-induced apoptosis
may result from caspase activation through ERK, JNK,
and p38MAPK pathways [11, 14–16]. However, other

INTRODUCTION
Prolactinomas are the most prevalent neuroendocrine
tumors, accounting for approximately 40% of all pituitary
adenomas [1]. Dopamine agonists (DAs), including
bromocriptine (BRC) and cabergoline (CAB), are the firstline treatment for these adenomas [1–6]. They effectively
suppress prolactin (PRL) hypersecretion, reduce tumor
size, and restore gonadal function [4, 7]. CAB is longer
acting, more effective, better tolerated, than BRC, with less
side-effects [8]. CAB is also effective in patients resistant
or poorly responsive to BRC [8]. Furthermore, CAB has
been used in treating patients with other types of pituitary
tumors, including acromaglic, clinically nonfunctioning,

mechanisms may also be involved in CAB-mediated tumor
shrinkage, in addition to apoptosis [2].
Crinophagy was the earliest description of
pituitary autophagy, as reported by Christian de Duve
in 1969 [17, 18]. Macroautophagy (called “authophagy”
throughout this paper) involves the sequestration of
cytoplasm by double-layered membranes to form
autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes, in which
their contents are degraded [19–21]. Autophagy serves
as a cytoprotective mechanism in response to stress. In
addition, autophagy can lead to cell death under specific
circumstances, a process known as ‘autophagic cell
death’ (ACD), which is distinguished from the other
form of programmed cell death, i.e. apoptosis [22].
Therefore, ACD is considered as an alternative cell
death mechanism, which is morphologically defined
(especially by transmission electron microscopy, TEM)
as a type of cell death that occurs in the absence of
chromatin condensation but is accompanied by largescale autophagic vacuolization of the cytoplasm [23].
The transition from protective autophagy to cytotoxic
autophagy relies on a balance between autophagosome
production and appropriate lysosomal degradation.
In this study, we provide evidence that CAB
concomitantly induces autophagosome formation and
inhibits the autophagic flux, leading to accumulation of
undigested autophagosomes and/or autolysosomes that
ultimately result in ACD. These findings elucidate novel
mechanisms for CAB action, suggesting that it may be
potentially used in medical management of other tumors
in addition to pituitary adenomas.

To characterize the CAB-induced cell death by
apoptosis, we used Z-VAD-FMK, a pan caspase inhibitor,
to treat the cells. In MMQ cells, Z-VAD-FMK can
only partially block CAB-induced cell death in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, in GH3 cells,
Z-VAD-FMK virtually failed to rescue cells from CABinduced cell death (Fig. 1F). These findings suggest that
CAB induce both apoptosis and non-apoptotic cell death.
Therefore, MMQ cells were treated with CAB for 6, 12,
24 and 48 h, and were examined by transmission electron
microscope (TEM). We noticed that, as early as 6 h of
CAB exposure, large-scale autophagic vacuoles occurred
in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1G and Supplemental Fig. 1A). At
12 h, cell death occurred and reached the peak after 48 h
CAB treatment, in the absence of chromatin condensation
but accompanied by large-scale autophagic vacuoles of the
cytoplasm (Fig. 1G and Supplemental Fig. 1A).
Together, these results indicate that CAB mediates
non-apoptotic cell death.

CAB suppresses mTOR pathway
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mTOR pathway integrates signals from growth factors,
nutrients and stresses to regulate cell survival and death
[25]. We thus tested whether CAB could also inactivate
AKT/mTOR pathway in pituitary cells. We found that
AKT/mTOR signaling was significantly inhibited in the
MMQ and GH3 cells by CAB in a time-dependent manner
as indicated by decreased phosphorylation of AKT and
mTOR as well as decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K
and 4EBP1, two key downstream effectors of the mTOR
pathway (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, rapamycin, an
inhibitor of mTOR, combined with CAB treatment, further
inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR and 4EBP1
(Fig. 2B), and increased MMQ cell death (Fig. 2C).

RESULTS
CAB induces both apoptotic and non-apoptotic
cell death
To test for cell death induced by CAB, MTS assays
were used to analyze in GH3 and MMQ cell lines. CAB
decreased viability of GH3 and MMQ cells in both a
dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with 50 μM
CAB in MMQ cells for 48 h induced cell death by up to
50% (Fig. 1A); however, in GH3 cells, 100 μM CAB was
required to produce a similar effect (Fig. 1B).
Previous studies have demonstrated that D2R
agonists, such as CAB and BRC, induce apoptosis in
pituitary tumors [12–14, 16, 24]. In accordance with
those observations, apoptosis assay using PI and Annexin
V-FITC double staining further revealed that CAB indeed
rendered MMQ and GH3 cells to undergo apoptosis
(Fig. 1C). CAB increased apoptotic related proteins such
as cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, and induced caspasedependent apoptosis in MMQ cells (Fig. 1D). However,
in GH3 cells, CAB can induce cell death without PARP
protein induction (Fig. 1E).

CAB induces autophagy
Having established that CAB suppressed AKT/
mTOR pathway in GH3 and MMQ cells, we next
investigated whether CAB also triggered autophagy, a
novel cellular response to regulate cell fate on mTOR
inactivation. During autophagy activation, microtubuleassociated protein light chain 3-I (LC3-I) is converted
to lipidated LC3-II, which is associated with autophagic
vesicles and displays classical punctate distribution.
This LC3-I to LC3-II conversion is a classical hallmark
of autophagy [26]. As shown in Fig. 3A, CAB induced
LC3-I conversion to LC3-II in MMQ and GH3 cells at
early stages of CAB treatment; furthermore, in GFP-LC3transfected MMQ and GH3 cells, CAB treatment induced
the formation of LC3 puncta, whereas in the vehicletreated control cells LC3-associated green fluorescence
was diffused in cytoplasm (GH3: 8.7 ± 1.5 vs 2.0 ± 0.4,

n = 50, p = 0.008; MMQ: 15.8 ± 2.1 vs 1.5± 0.3, n = 50,
p < 0.001, respectively, Fig. 3B). TEM revealed increased
numbers of autophagosomes and/or autolysosomes in
the GH3 and MMQ cells treated with CAB compared
with those in control cells (GH3: 7.5 ± 1.3 vs. 0.5 ± 0.3,
n = 50, p = 0.002; MMQ: 10.6 ± 0.9 vs. 0.8 ± 0.3, n = 50,
p <  0.0001; Fig. 3C) , suggesting that CAB strongly
induces autophagy activity in these cells.

To rule out the possibility that the accumulation of p62
was due to increased p62 transcription, we measured the
p62 mRNA level. We found that CAB promoted a small
increase in p62 mRNA transcription after 6 h; however,
the p62 mRNA level declined dramatically after 12 h of
CAB treatment (Fig. 4B), indicating that the accumulation
of p62 was not due to increased p62 transcription; but
rather, degradation of the p62 protein was blocked and
autophagic flux was disrupted in CAB-treated cells.
To determine the reason for the disruption of
the autophagic flux, we first ruled out the possibility of
fusion dysfunction between the autophagosomes and the
lysosomes. TEM clearly demonstrated the accumulation
of autolysosomes inside the MMQ cells, indicating
intact fusion function between the autophagosomes and
the lysosomes (Fig. 1G and Fig. 3C). In addition, we
found that after 4 h CAB treatment, MMQ cells showed
a punctate pattern of GFP-LC3 fluorescence, while after
24 h CAB stimulation, GFP-LC3 and lysotracker largely
colocalized, indicating the formation of LC3 and the
intact fusion between autophagosomes and the lysosomes
(Fig. 5A). Staining with lysosensor green DND-189,

CAB blocks autophagic flux by impairing
lysosomal degradation within autolysosomes
Next, the integrity of autophagic flux was evaluated,
because autophagy relies on lysosomes for the degradation
of autophagosomal cargos. We checked whether CAB
could induce the degradation of autophagy cargo p62, a
marker of autophagic flux. Accumulation of p62 has been
used as a marker of autophagy inhibition or indicator
for defects in autophagic degradation [27, 28]. Using
Western blotting, we observed a time-dependent increase
in p62 levels after the CAB treatment in the MMQ and
GH3 cells (Fig. 4A). The increase in p62 was evident as
early as 6 h after initial CAB exposure in the MMQ cells.

fluorescence intensity upon acidification, revealed that
the autolysosomes in MMQ cells after 24 h of CAB
treatment exhibited much higher fluorescence intensity
than that in control cells (Fig. 5B). Flow cytometry further
demonstrated that CAB markedly augmented lysosome
acidification (Fig. 5C).
BafA1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type
H (+)-ATPases, increased the lysosomal pH and reversed
the CAB-mediated lysosomal acidification (Fig. 5D).
Moreover, BafA1 consistently reversed the CAB-induced
decline in cell viability (Fig. 5E) and inhibited the CABinduced LC3-II accumulation and PARP expression at 6 h
and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 5F). Those findings indicate
that CAB augments lysosome acidification, leading to
impaired lysosomal degradation and the accumulation
of p62.
Taken together, our observations indicate that in
sequential events, CAB first triggers autophagy but then
progressively disrupts the autophagic flux, leading to an
accumulation of undigested autolysosomes.

Over-activation of autophagy has been reported
to induce ACD [29, 30]. To test whether increased
autophagy and disrupted autophagic flux was responsible
for cell death, we applied siRNA to effectively
knockdown expressions of ATG7, which is required for
autophagy initiation, and then tested viability of MMQ
cells. Silencing of ATG7 decreased LC3-II levels and
substantially reduced cleaved PARP (Fig. 6A), and also
reduced the number of autolysosomes per cell (7.2 ± 0.8
vs 4.3 ± 0.6, n = 50, p = 0.0072, Fig. 6B). Knockdown of
ATG7 almost completely reversed CAB-mediated decrease
of MMQ cell viability at 24 hours (Fig. 6C). At 24 h, cell
death was decreased by 22% after silencing of ATG7 (from
39% to 17%, shown in Fig. 6D). Furthermore, knockdown
of Becn1 and ATG5, two other autophagy essential genes,
suppressed CAB-induced cell death as well (Fig. 6E
and 6F). Similar to autophagy inhibition by siRNA, the

chemical inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA also reversed
CAB-mediated cell death in MMQ cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed in GH3 cells, too
(Supplementary Fig. 3A and 3B).
Together, these findings indicate that induction of
autophagy by CAB is required for cell death.

DISCUSSION
We demonstrate for the first time that CAB induces
autophagy-dependent cell death as evidenced by [31]: (1)
CAB induces autophagy as indicated by the conversion of
LC3-I to LC3-II, increased GFP-LC3, and autophagosome
formation; (2) CAB blocks autophagic flux, leading
to impaired or retarded autophagic degradation and
substantial accumulation of autophagosomal cargos such
as p62; (3) knockdown of ATG7, ATG5, and BECN1 can
reduce CAB-mediated cell death. These findings elucidate
a novel mechanism for CAB treatment of prolactinomas,
and suggest its potential therapeutic use for other tumors.
CAB converts autophagy into a cell death
mechanism by concomitant induction of autophagy and
inhibition of the autophagic flux. Treatment of CAB
in MMQ and GH3 cells resulted in rapid inhibition of
mTOR activity and striking induction of LC3-II levels,
along with a marked increase in the number and size of
GFP-LC3-positive
autophagosomes,
suggesting

CAB inhibits tumor growth in MMQ
xenograft model
Finally, we investigated whether CAB suppressed
in vivo tumor growth in a MMQ xenograft model. Nude
mice with MMQ xenograft were divided into control
group and CAB treatment group. We found that the tumor
sizes and the weights in the CAB treatment group were
significantly smaller when compared with that of the
control group (273.7 ± 55.5 mm3 in CAB treated group
vs. 669.4 ± 156.7 mm3 in the control group, P = 0.029;
Fig. 7A, 7B and 7C). Tumor weight was 0.35 ± 0.02 gand
0.99 ± 0.22 g in the CAB treatment group and control
group, respectively (P = 0.01). Consistently, substantial
up-regulation of LC3-II and p62 protein, and downregulation of p-4EBP1 were observed in tumors from
CAB treated group (Fig. 7D).

induction of autophagy [32]. On the other hand, CAB
blocks autophagic flux, causing accumulation of p62
and undigested autophagosomes in which autophagic
degradation was impaired or retarded [33]. The optimal
lysosome pH is essential for lysosomal proteases to
regulate degradation; at either lower or higher pH,
lysosome protease activity is impaired [34]. CAB
dramatically increases lysosome acidity, thus generated
an unfavorable environment for proteases and resulted in
impaired lysosomal degradation within autolysosomes,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

leading to blockade of autophagic flux. Following the
blockade of autophagic flux, CAB converts autophagy
into a cell death mechanism which was confirmed by
knock-down of proteins essential for autophagy. Knockdown of ATG7 , ATG5, and Becn1, as well as chemical
inhibition of autophagy, can significantly decrease the
CAB-mediated MMQ cell death, indicating that autophagy
indeed played an important role in the cytotoxicity of
CAB. It has been shown that genetic inhibition of the ATG
genes can prevent autophagic cell death in human U937

indicating that inhibition of apoptotic machinery might
unravel an alternative cell death pathway that involves
autophagy. A number of reports have also confirmed
inhibition of cell death by knockdown of ATG genes,

demonstrating that autophagy plays an essential deathpromoting role [37–40].
In MMQ cell, CAB-induced cell death involves
both apoptotic and autophagic pathway. Our TEM results

large-scale AVs of the cytoplasm, which is rarely seen
in typically apoptosis. Apoptosis and autophagy are two
parallel pathways leading to cell death; each is activated
depending on the stimulus and cell type, and sometimes
may overlapping with each other [41]. It has been shown
that cytotoxic signals can induce autophagy in cells that
are resistant to apoptosis [42], such as those expressing
high Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, or those being exposed to pancaspase inhibitors, such as Z-VAD-FMK [35]. Also,
autophagy may contribute to cytotoxic and apoptosis
response [43]. In addition, autophagy may directly
induce cell death, known as ACD [44]. We showed that
MMQ cells showed Annexin-V staining and activation
of caspase-3, which are features of typical apoptosis; but
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK only partially reduced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell death. It is possible that Z-VAD-FMK can also block
other enzymes at the concentration used in this study,
such as cathepsins, which have previously been reported
to be involved in caspase-dependent and –independent cell
death [45, 46]. Caspase-3 activation is not only a marker
of apoptosis, but also immediately precedes autophagic
cell death as well as ATG gene transcription [47].
Therefore, apoptotic and autophagic modes of cell death
can coexist as consequence of intracytoplamsic release of
lysosomal enzymes upon CAB treatment. Together, they
are parallel pathway both contribute to cell death, as has
been shown before [44, 48].
In summary, this study demonstrates that CAB
upregulates the autophagy response through inhibiting
mTOR pathways, and also augments lysosome

acidification resulting in impaired lysosomal degradation
within autolysosomes, which severely blocks the
autophagic flux and leads to accumulation of undigested
cargos. Persistence of autophagy blockade disrupts
the balance between autophagosome production and
appropriate degradation capacity, which ultimately
results in ACD. These findings present new insights into
our understanding of mechanisms of CAB treatment for
prolactinomas, as well as provide a novel therapeutic
strategy for the medical management of other tumors.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING
We are grateful to Prof. Shlomo Melmed (Pituitary
Center, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, Los Angeles) for his critical evaluation and
linguistic revision of this manuscript.
This project was supported by grants from the
National Natural Science Foundation of China (81271523
and 81471392 to Z.B.W).

Staining
For staining of lysosensor green DND-189, a
pH indicator that exhibits a pH-dependent increase
in fluorescence intensity upon acidification, cells
were labeled with 1 μM LysoSensor Green DND-189
(Invitrogen) for 30 min. After the probe-containing
medium was replaced with fresh medium, the cells
were examined under a fluorescence microscope. For
Lysotracker staining, cells were labeled with 0.5 μM
lysotracker (Invitrogen) for 10 min, and then the probecontaining medium was replaced with fresh medium.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

Five-week-old female athymic nude mice were
purchased from the SLAC (Shanghai, China). One million
MMQ cells in PBS were subcutaneously injected into
the right back of each nude mouse. The animals were
assigned randomly to two groups and the tumors were
allowed to grow to ~50 mm3 in size. At this point,
vehicle or CAB (0.5 mg/kg/d) in 100 μl of 0.9% saline
was administered daily by gavage. Tumor volumes was
measured by a vernier caliper every day and calculated as
(length × width2)/2. Ten days later, all mice were sacrificed
and tumors were harvested, followed by photography
and Western blot. All procedures were performed in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
