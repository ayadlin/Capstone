Abstract
In contrast to prior belief, tumor cell apoptosis is not
necessarily silent but can be immunogenic. By tracing how
anthracyclines and ;-irradiation trigger immunogenic cell
deaths, we found that they were causally connected to the
exposure of calreticulin on the tumor cell surface, before
apoptosis in the tumor cell itself occurred. Furthermore, we
showed that calreticulin exposure was necessary and sufficient to increase proimmunogenic killing by other chemotherapies. Our findings suggest that calreticulin could serve as
a biomarker to predict therapy-associated immune responses,
and that tactics to expose calreticulin might improve the
clinical efficacy of many cancer therapies. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The chemotherapy of cancer is often conceived as analogous to
the antibiotic treatment of microbial infection. A complete and
permanent cure can be obtained by an anticancer agent that would
kill all tumor cells including cancer stem cells and micrometastases.
As in bacterial or viral infection, however, it is plausible that an
immune response elicited against the residual cancer cells might
contribute to the complete eradication of micrometastases and
cancer stem cells (1, 2). Driven by this consideration, we speculated
that chemotherapeutic regimes that would stimulate an immune
response against tumor cells should be particularly efficient (3, 4).
Indeed, some peculiar chemotherapeutic regimens can stimulate
the immune system as a warranted side effect, by acting on the
immune effectors themselves. As an example, low-dose cyclophosphamide can deplete regulatory T cells, thus deinhibiting anticancer
immune responses in mice and humans (5, 6). Imatinib mesylate
can stimulate dendritic cells (DC), natural killer cells, and a cell type
with mixed DC/natural killer characteristics that may act as an
antitumor effector (7). Another possibility to stimulate anticancer
immune responses is to kill tumor cells in a fashion that they are
recognized by the immune system (refs. 8–12; Fig. 1A).
According to current knowledge, cell death, as it physiologically
occurs—at a pace of several million events per second in the

healthy human adult—is nonimmunogenic. This absence of
immunogenicity may be related to the fact that apoptotic cells
emit ‘‘eat-me’’ signals to neighboring cells that lead to the efficient
phagocytic removal of apoptotic corpses, in a way that no immune
response is elicited or that self-tolerance is reinforced (13). Genetic
defects in the phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells could thus lead
to autoimmune disease (14).
Driven by these considerations, we investigated whether some
chemotherapeutic agents might elicit a type of cell death that, at
variance with physiologic cell death, would be immunogenic.
Murine CT26 colon cancer cells or MCA205 fibrosarcoma cells were
treated with a panel of 20 different cell death–inducing agents
in vitro and the dying cells were injected s.c. into immunocompetent histocompatible mice. One week later, the animals were
rechallenged with live CT26 or MCA205 cells, and the absence of
tumor growth was scored as an indication of successful anticancer
vaccination. Using this protocol, we found that most cell death
inducers including agents that damage DNA, mitochondria,
lysosomes, or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) failed to elicit
antitumor immune responses. However, a few lethal agents turned
out to be highly efficient in triggering immunogenic cell death. This
applied to anthracyclines (doxorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxanthrone)
as well as to g-irradiation (8, 11, 15). Importantly, caspase inhibition
by Z-VAD or by the baculoviral caspase inhibitor, p35, which
suppress the late manifestations of apoptosis (yet do not prevent
cell death as such), completely abolished the immunogenicity of cell
death induced by a long treatment (24 h) with doxorubicin (15).
Systematic comparisons of CT26 cells succumbing to immunogenic and nonimmunogenic cell death failed to reveal clear-cut
ultrastructural differences. Both immunogenic cell death inducers
(anthracyclines) and nonimmunogenic death stimuli (such as
etoposide and mitomycin C) were indistinguishable in triggering
the hallmarks of apoptosis including cellular and nuclear
shrinkage with chromatin condensation, outer mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization, and phosphatidylserine exposure on
the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane before viability is lost.
Both immunogenic and nonimmunogenic cell death led to
caspase activation, indicating that activation of this class of
cysteine proteases was required but was not sufficient for
immunogenic cell death (15). We therefore set out to determine
subtle biochemical changes in the plasma membrane surface of
cells undergoing immunogenic versus nonimmunogenic cell death.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoreses coupled to mass spectroscopy revealed that anthracyclines were uniquely capable of
inducing the exposure of calreticulin on the outer face of the
plasma membrane (11).
Calreticulin is a Ca2+-binding lectin chaperone that is mostly
present in the ER lumen. Indeed, calreticulin is frequently used as

Figure 1. Calreticulin (CRT ) exposure in immunogenic cell death. A, the principle of immunogenic chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic agent can have an
immunostimulatory effect, either by a direct action on the immune system or by inducing a type of tumor cell death that elicits an immune response. The
immune system then contributes to the eradication of residual tumor cells. B, signal transduction pathway leading to calreticulin exposure. Anthracyclines or
g-irradiation lead to the activation of one or several unknown caspases and then to the phosphorylation of eIF2a, followed by the translocation of calreticulin to
the cell surface. Anthracyclines or g-irradiation also cause cell death. Inhibitors of the PP1/GADD34 complex stimulate the phosphorylation of eIF2a without
caspase activation and without cell death. The hyperphosphorylation of eIF2a is then followed by the translocation of preformed calreticulin from the ER to the
plasma membrane surface. C, effects of immunogenic cell death on DC. Early calreticulin exposure is required for the uptake of antigen by DC. Additional signals
emanating from the dying tumor cell are required for the maturation of DC, and hence, for optimal MHC class I–restricted presentation of tumor-derived peptides
to CTLs.

an ER-specific marker in subcellular localization studies (16, 17).
However, calreticulin can also appear on the surface of dying cells,
serving as an ‘‘eat-me’’ signal for neighboring phagocytes (14, 18).
Contrasting with the standard kinetics of calreticulin exposure,
which parallels the presence of phosphatidylserine on the cell
surface (18), we found that anthracyclines elicited calreticulin
exposure with very rapid kinetics. Thus, calreticulin exposure
occurred within minutes after the addition of anthracyclines,
whereas phosphatidylserine exposure occurred only after several
hours of treatment. Additional experiments revealed that calreticulin exposed at the cell surface of anthracyclin-stressed (or girradiated) tumor cells translocated as a preformed (rather than
neo-synthesized) protein to the cell surface, correlating with the
phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor
eIF2a. Inhibition of the phosphatase that dephosphorylates eIF2a
(which is composed of a catalytic subunit, protein phosphatase 1 or
PP1, and an adaptor called GADD34) also led to the hyperphosphorylation of eIF2a and efficiently induced the surface
exposure of calreticulin. Chemical inhibitors of PP1 (such as
tautomycin or calyculin A) or of the PP1/GADD34 complex (such
as salubrinal; ref. 19) induced calreticulin exposure on the cell
surface without any major cytotoxic effects (Fig. 1B).
Preapoptotic calreticulin exposure strongly correlated with the
immunogenicity of cell death induced by distinct lethal compounds. More convincingly, we found that the knockdown of
calreticulin by means of a small interfering RNA sufficed to
abolish the immunogenicity of cell death elicited by anthracyclines (11) or g-irradiation (8), as determined by injecting dying
cells into immunocompetent mice and rechallenging the same
animals with live tumor cells. When calreticulin expression was
knocked down with a small interfering RNA, and recombinant
calreticulin protein was absorbed to the surface of the cells,
recombinant calreticulin restored the immunogenicity of cells
subjected to calreticulin knockdown plus anthracyclin treatment.
In addition, recombinant calreticulin could reestablish the
immunogenicity of cells treated with etoposide or mitomycin
C—two agents that induce per se nonimmunogenic cell death
(and fail to expose calreticulin on the surface; refs. 11, 12). These
findings indicate that early calreticulin exposure is both necessary
and sufficient to render cell death immunogenic. The fact that
exogenous recombinant calreticulin (which should be free from
tumor-derived peptides) could substitute for endogenous calreticulin in this setting, also suggests that it is not the presentation of
tumor peptide by calreticulin that accounts for its immunogenic
effect (20).
These results were obtained in prophylactic antitumor vaccination experiments and could be recapitulated in the treatment of
established tumors. Local injection of established CT26 colon
carcinomas (in BALB/c mice) or MC205 fibrosarcomas (in C57Bl/6
mice) with anthracyclines led to the permanent regression of
neoplasias. The treatment of such tumors could only be obtained
in animals bearing an intact immune system and became impossible when dendritic cells, CD4+, or CD8+ T cells were eliminated.
Conversely, local injection of mitomycin C and etoposide (which
induce tumor cell death but not calreticulin exposure), PP1/
GADD34 inhibitors (which induce calreticulin exposure but not cell
death), or recombinant calreticulin alone had no curative effects.
However, the combination of cytotoxic agents plus PP1/GADD34
inhibitors or recombinant calreticulin cured most, if not all, tumors
established in immunocompetent hosts. No such curative effect
was ever seen in athymic nu/nu mice (11, 12). These results indicate

www.aacrjournals.org

that cell death coupled to calreticulin exposure could elicit an
immune response that contributes to the cure of cancer. Indeed,
animals that had been cured from tumors exhibited long-term
immunity against specific tumor antigens.
What then, are the mechanisms through which calreticulin
exposure renders cell death immunogenic? One of the ratelimiting steps in the stimulation of cytotoxic T cell responses is
the uptake of antigenic material by immature DC, which can
present antigenic peptides bound to MHC class I molecules after a
critical maturation step. Hence, cell death must trigger at least
two essential steps to be immunogenic: (a) uptake of antigen by
DC and (b) DC maturation (21). Blockade of calreticulin with an
avian antibody or prevention of calreticulin exposure (either by
caspase inhibition of by calreticulin knockdown) abolished the
recognition of dying tumor cells by DC in vitro and in vivo.
However, inhibition of calreticulin exposure did not affect the
capacity of dying tumor cells to stimulate DC maturation, and
recombinant calreticulin failed to elicit the activation or
maturation of DC (11). This suggests that calreticulin exposure
is essential for the phagocytic recognition of apoptotic cells by
DC, yet is dispensable for DC maturation and activation (Fig. 1C).
Other molecules liberated from dying cells must account for DC
maturation (22).
The aforementioned results may, potentially, have profound
implications for anticancer therapy (23, 24). Provided that these
data can be extrapolated to the human system, we can formulate
the following predictions:
1. Some, but not all, chemotherapeutic regimens can induce
immunogenic cell death with early calreticulin exposure, thus
eliciting a therapy-associated anticancer immune response
that determines disease outcome. It will be important to
determine which anticancer regimens induce calreticulin
exposure and immunogenic cell death. Such regimens may
be particularly efficient in treating cancer if applied in a
context in which patients do not suffer from therapy-induced
immunosuppression.
2. Tumors that fail to expose calreticulin in response to
radiotherapy or immunogenic chemotherapy (e.g., with anthracyclines) should escape from the immunogenic component of
the antitumor response, and hence, should have a particularly
negative prognosis. As a result, it may be interesting to monitor
calreticulin exposure or the presence of all components of the
signal transduction machinery leading to calreticulin exposure
in tumor cells, with the hope of establishing new prognostic or
predictive biomarkers.
3. Therapeutic regimes designed to reestablish calreticulin
exposure ( for instance by inhibiting PP1/GADD34) should
enhance the immunogenicity of cell death, and hence, boost
the therapeutic efficacy of per se nonimmunogenic regimens.
Thus, it may be expected that combinations of tumor-cytotoxic
and immunostimulatory agents would synergize in therapeutic
efficacy.
