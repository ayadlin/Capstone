ABSTRACT
In some tumours, despite a wild-type p53 gene, the p53 pathway is inactivated
by alterations in its regulators or by unknown mechanisms, leading to resistance
to cytotoxic therapies. Understanding the mechanisms of functional inactivation of
wild-type p53 in these tumours may help to define prospective targets for treating
cancer by restoring p53 activity.
Recently, we identified TRIM8 as a new p53 modulator, which stabilizes p53
impairing its association with MDM2 and inducing the reduction of cell proliferation.
In this paper we demonstrated that TRIM8 deficit dramatically impairs p53mediated cellular responses to chemotherapeutic drugs and that TRIM8 is down
regulated in patients affected by clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), an
aggressive drug-resistant cancer showing wild-type p53. These results suggest that
down regulation of TRIM8 might be an alternative way to suppress p53 activity in RCC.
Interestingly, we show that TRIM8 expression recovery in RCC cell lines renders these
cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatments following p53 pathway re-activation.
These findings provide the first mechanistic link between TRIM8 and the drug
resistance of ccRCC and suggest more generally that TRIM8 could be used as enhancer
of the chemotherapy efficacy in cancers where p53 is wild-type and its pathway is
defective.

INTRODUCTION

protein as the efficacy of most chemotherapeutic drugs
is dependent on a successful execution of p53-mediated
apoptosis to override self-sufficiency in growth signals
and insensitivity to antigrowth signals typical of cancer
cells [1-3]. Indeed, tumours harbouring p53 mutations,
which lead to expression of inactive p53 protein, account
for about 50% of all human cancers. These tumours are

associated with chemo resistance and, in general, predict
a considerably worse patient prognosis in comparison
with malignancies with functional p53 [4-6]. Besides
the many tumours that have an inactivating mutation in
the TP53 coding sequence, an additional 40% do contain
a wild-type TP53 gene but the p53 pathway is often
inactivated through alterations in its regulators or rather
still unknown mechanisms [7]. The reactivation of p53
in cancer cells is certainly a promising treatment strategy
[8]. Current p53-based therapeutic attempts focus on
ectopically expressing wild-type p53 in p53-null tumours
or restoring p53 pathway in tumours in which p53 is
incapacitated by alterations of other pathway components
[9]. Among cancers showing rare p53 mutations and
poor response to conventional anti-cancer treatments,
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents an extraordinary
example of the importance of p53 pathway alterations in
therapy resistance. RCC is a family of cancers including
five major subtypes (clear cell, papillary type I and
type II, chromophobe, collecting duct, and unclassified
RCC) that originate from the renal tubular epithelium,
but unlike other epithelial cancers originating from
other districts such as colon, breast, lung, stomach and
bladder, p53 mutations in RCC are particularly rare,
especially in the clear cell subtype (ccRCC) [10-13].
Resistance against most chemotherapeutic agents is partly
mediated by multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)
whose expression is higher in the invasive tumours (e.g.,
ccRCCs) compared with non-invasive kidney tumours,
such as renal oncocytomas (ROs) and decreases in the
more undifferentiated tumours, but still remains at levels
high enough to be drug resistant [14, 15]. Besides this,
resistance against radiotherapy and cytotoxic drugs
depends on the disruption of p53 signalling, although
the importance of p53 alterations in RCC has been the
subject of conflicting observations [16]. However, several
studies showed that mutated p53 found in the papillary,
chromophobe, and ccRCC subtypes, appears to be
accompanied by metastatic progression of the disease and
poor survival of patients with RCC and a correlation of
p53 expression with TNM classification seems to suggest
that p53 mutations might have an important role in the
progression of RCC [17-19]. The induction of the p53
pathway during treatment of RCC clearly could boost
the cellular response to stress stimuli led by cytotoxic
chemotherapy regimens, normally ineffective on the
most aggressive subtype of this family of cancers, i.e.,
ccRCC. Also, immunotherapy with interferon alpha
(INFα) and interleukin 2 (IL2), the first therapeutics to
result in regressions of metastatic renal cell carcinoma,
seems to take advantage of a reactivation of p53. Indeed,
these biological response modifiers, as these cytokines are
often defined, predominantly act through a combination
of the stimulation of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, a direct
antiproliferative activity, and anti-angiogenetic effects,
in which p53 may be involved considering its role in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

controlling cell growth, apoptosis and angiogenesis [20,
21].
In this complex scenario of p53 stability and activity
regulation, we recently identified a new key regulator of
p53 in the cell cycle arrest versus apoptosis decision,
i.e. TRIM8 [22]. We demonstrated that p53 promotes
the transcription of TRIM8, which in turn is able to
interact with p53 preventing the binding to MDM2 hence
resulting in the stabilization of p53. To further strengthen
these recent findings, TRIM8 was found to induce also
the degradation of MDM2. Interestingly, TRIM8 deficit
dramatically impaired p53 stabilization and activation
after a genotoxic stress.
TRIM8 belongs to a subfamily of the RING type
E3 ubiquitin ligases characterized by a tripartite motif
and some of whose members function as important
regulators for carcinogenesis [23]. Each member seems
to have a peculiar function relative to the p53 pathway,
both antagonizing and enhancing p53 response to specific
stimuli [24-26].
Here we show that TRIM8 deficit dramatically
impairs p53 stabilization and activation in response to
chemotherapeutic drugs. By comparing tumour and
corresponding healthy tissues, we found that in patients
affected by ccRCC, TRIM8 expression level is decreased,
while no alterations were observed in ROs. Importantly,
the restoration of TRIM8 levels in RCC cell line makes
them more sensitive to the action of Nutlin-3 and Cisplatin
treatments, through the reactivation of the p53 pathway.

RESULTS
TRIM8 silencing prevents p53 activation after
chemotherapeutic drug treatment
In order to test the effects of TRIM8 deficit on the
p53-dependent cellular response to chemotherapeutic
drugs, different p53 wild-type cell lines (HCT116,
MCF-7, U2OS, HK-2) were transfected with unspecific
shRNA control vector or with TRIM8 specific shRNA.
The abrogation of TRIM8 endogenous expression was
confirmed by western blotting and qRT-PCR (Figure
1B and Supplementary Figure 1). After transfection
the cells were treated with two chemoterapeutic drugs,
namely Nutlin-3 and Cisplatin. MTT proliferation assays
demonstrated that TRIM8 silencing resulted in increased
cell proliferation rate as a result of MDM2 protein
stabilization and accordingly p53 protein degradation in
all cell lines analysed, impairing the anti-proliferative
action of the chemotherapeutic drugs (Figure 1A-B).
As it is well known that Cisplatin and Nutlin-3 induce
p53 activation [27-31], we analysed whether TRIM8
deficit could impair this activation. We found that in
MCF-7, HCT116, U2OS and HK-2 cell lines, Nutlin-3

as well as Cisplatin treatment induced p53 stabilization
and transactivation of p53 target genes (e.g. p21, BAX,
GADD45) (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 2), while
TRIM8 silencing brought down p53 endogenous protein
levels and the transactivation of p53 target genes involved
in cell cycle arrest program (p21 and GADD45) (Figure
1B and Supplementary Figure 2) [22]. Consistently,
TRIM8 depletion prevented p53 phosphorylation on
Ser-15 and Ser-20 upon drug treatments as demonstrated
by the addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132, which

preserved the degradation of p53 and clearly indicated that
p53 is not phosphorylated (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Figure 3). Consistent with these results, we found that
TRIM8 silencing induced MDM2 stabilization, thereby
impairing Cisplatin and Nutlin-3 effect (Figure 1B).
These results strongly suggest that TRIM8 levels
are relevant to the p53-mediated cellular responses to
chemotherapeutic drugs.

TRIM8 expression is down regulated in ccRCC

As shown in Figure 2A, on average tumour samples
expressed TRIM8 at a lower level (3.2-fold; p-value
= 2.33E-06) than non-tumour renal epithelial tissue.
Accordingly TRIM8 protein levels in tumour samples were
lower compared to non-tumour counterpart (Figure 2B).
Intriguingly, this is true for all the ccRCC sample pairs
analysed. Considering the variation of TRIM8 expression
in each ccRCC tissue pair and Fuhrman grade, no
variation was detected indicating that the down-regulation
of TRIM8 expression seems to be independent from the
severity of this type of tumour (Supplementary Figure
4A). Importantly, no alterations in TRIM8 expression were
observed in renal oncocytoma samples compared to nontumour tissue (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 4B).
Since we previously demonstrated that TRIM8 is
a direct p53 target gene [22], we investigated whether
the decreased expression of TRIM8 in ccRCC was due
to p53 mutations. Full-length p53 cDNA was amplified
by PCR starting from total RNA extracted by tumour and
non-tumour tissues. Sequence analysis showed that all the
ccRCC and oncocytoma samples had wild-type p53 (data
not shown). This finding was consistent with literature
data indicating that the p53 gene is infrequently mutated
in kidney cancers.

In the attempt to translate our findings in vivo
and set the basis for the use of TRIM8 as enhancer of
the chemotherapy efficacy, we investigated whether
in tumours highly resistant to chemotherapy, TRIM8
expression levels were lower compared to normal tissue.
Thus we measured TRIM8 expression levels in patients
affected by clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) or
renal oncocytoma (RO). We considered these two subtypes
of RCC as they show very different clinical behaviour,
the first being extremely non responsive to conventional
radiation and chemotherapeutic treatments, while the latter
showing excellent prognosis because of its benign nature.
Twenty patients (10 males and 10 females; mean
age: 63.8 ± 10.8 years), who underwent surgery for
ccRCC at histological analysis, and 4 patients (all males;
mean age: 63.25 ± 4.86) affected by RO were analysed
for TRIM8 expression by qRT-PCR and western blotting
(Figures 2A-B). The relatively low number of RO
samples was due to the rarity of occurrence of this benign
neoplasia. Two samples from each patient were available,
one from renal cancer tissue and one from non-neoplastic
surrounding renal epithelial tissue.

These results suggest that TRIM8 expression
is down regulated in ccRCC but not in the benign
oncocytoma, suggesting that the decrease of TRIM8
expression is linked to a malignant transformation of the
cells.

TRIM8 up-regulation restores p53 tumour
suppressor activity in renal cell carcinoma
In order to rule out a potential role for TRIM8
deficit in determining the resistance of the ccRCC to
chemotherapy due to prevention of p53 full activation,
we evaluated whether the recovery of TRIM8 expression
levels renders the renal tumour cells more sensitive to
conventional chemotherapy.
We took advantage of an immortalized proximal
tubule epithelial cell line derived from normal adult human
kidney (HK-2) and of two renal clear cell carcinoma
derived cell lines (RCC Shaw and Elthem). HK-2 cells,
already used for TRIM8 silencing experiments (Figures
1A-B and Supplementary Figure 1), retain functional
characteristics of proximal tubular epithelium. All cell
lines express wild-type p53. We first measured the TRIM8
expression levels in the three cell lines (Figure 3A-B) and
confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blotting that RCC
derived cell lines had lower TRIM8 mRNA and protein
levels than HK-2, consistently with the results observed
in RCC patients analysed (Figure 2A-B). Exploring the
molecular basis of TRIM8 expression deficit observed in a
p53 wild-type RCC cell lines, we analysed by quantitative
PCR in these cell lines two regions of the TRIM8 gene

The ratio of qPCR signals from both TRIM8 region 1 and 2, and TP63 locus in HK-2 was normalized to 1.0 and used to calibrate the same
ratios in RCC Shaw and Elthem. Data shown are the mean of at least three independent experiments. * p-value < 0.05. ** p-value < 0.01.

and a region of the bi-allelic p63 gene locus as control.
As expected, the p63 gene locus showed nearly identical
quantification cycles (data not shown). After normalizing
gene dosage data and comparing them to HK-2 cells, we
observed a reduction of the 5’ region of TRIM8 gene
(region 1) equal to about 0.5 in RCC Shaw cells and 0.2
in RCC Elthem cells, and similar ratios were calculated
for the 3’ region (region 2), i.e., about 0.4 and 0.1,
respectively in RCC Shaw and Elthem cell lines (Figure
3C). This clearly suggests that TRIM8 expression deficit
in RCC cell lines could be due to the loss of one copy
of the gene, although we cannot exclude other possible
mechanisms.
Next, we analysed the response of these three cell
lines to Cisplatin and Nutlin-3 treatment (Figures 4A-B).

MTT proliferation assays demonstrated that Cisplatin and
Nutlin-3 induced a reduction of HK-2 cell proliferation
rate, but had no effect at all on RCC cell proliferation
rate. Interestingly, the overexpression of TRIM8 in all cell
types induced a great reduction in proliferation rate, which
became more pronounced when the cells were treated with
Nutlin-3 and Cisplatin (Figure 4A).
Next we investigated if the cell proliferation
decrease observed in HK-2 and RCC lines, upon
TRIM8 overexpression, was the result of p53 activation.
Consistent with MTT results, only HK-2 cell line showed
a faint p53 and p21 protein levels increase upon Nutlin-3
or Cisplatin treatment, while TRIM8 overexpression
induced in all cell lines the stabilization of endogenous
p53 and p21 proteins, whose levels were further

Nutlin-3 (10 µM). Western blot of Actin was conducted as control.

increased after Cisplatin and Nutlin-3 treatment (Figure
4B). Interestingly, differently from HK-2 cells where
in parallel with p53 stabilization, MDM2 protein levels
decreased, in both RCC cell lines TRIM8 over-expression
induced a stabilization of MDM2 (Figure 4B), though this
stabilization did not lead to p53 degradation. Currently,
we do not know how MDM2 increases in RCC cell lines
upon TRIM8 overexpression. In order to understand the
mechanism by which MDM2-mediated p53 degradation is
prevented in RCC cells upon TRIM8 over-expression, we
performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which
demonstrated that MDM2-p53 binding is easily displaced
when TRIM8 is expressed (Figure 5), as we previously
found in HCT116 cells [22].
Altogether, these findings demonstrated that
Cisplatin and Nutlin-3 treatments resulted more effective
when TRIM8 expression is restored in ccRCC cells.

is found in tumours with p53 wild-type status [32]. In
addition to MDM2 amplification, deletion of ARF, also
resulting in elevated levels of MDM2, was found to
reduce p53 function [33, 34]. In this context some authors
postulated that p53, or more precisely its transcriptional
activity, is intact in RCC, and that MDM2 alone should
play a pivotal role in treatment resistance [35]. On the
contrary, it has been reported that p53 activity is abolished
in RCC cell lines independently from MDM2 by an
uncommon dominant mechanism [36, 37].
In this rather complex scenario, we assessed
whether TRIM8 deficit would contribute to the p53
inactivity following chemotherapeutic treatment. TRIM8
belongs to the Tripartite Motif protein family, whose
members have been implicated in a variety of processes
like development, differentiation and cancer [38, 39].
Recently, we demonstrated that under a stress condition
p53 promotes the transcription of TRIM8, which in turn
by a positive feedback mechanism interacts with p53,
sustains its stabilization displacing MDM2, and promotes
p53-dependent cell growth arrest [22]. Here we showed
that TRIM8 deficit prevented p53 activation following
drug treatments in several p53 wild-type cell lines (Figure
1B and Supplementary Figures 1, 2). Accordingly, we
found that TRIM8 expression was dramatically down
regulated in ccRCC (Figure 2A-B). This deficit is likely
due to the loss of one copy of the gene (Figure 3C). It
has been previously demonstrated that TRIM8 maps on
chromosome 10q24.3 within a region mostly involved
in deletions and rearrangements in brain tumours [40].
We cannot definitely assert that TRIM8 deficit in Renal

DISCUSSION
ccRCC is the most common subtype of RCC
accounting for about 80% of surgical cases and is
characterized by exceptionally high resistance to radiation
and chemotherapy despite harbouring a wild-type p53.
Conflicting results have been reported on the functionality
of p53 in RCC. One observed mechanism to hamper p53
function is the amplification of its negative regulator
MDM2, detected in about 7% of all human cancers [32].
Although amplification of MDM2 is observed both in wild
type and mutant p53 tumours, a significant correlation

lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the p53 specific antibody DO-1. The immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by
immunoblotting using MDM2- and HA- antibodies to detect respectively MDM2 and TRIM8 physical interaction with p53.

Cell Carcinoma is specifically due to the loss of TRIM8
heterozygosity, as other additional mechanisms, such
as epigenetic silencing, could be involved. In any case,
since very low percentages of RCC cases are found to
have p53 mutations, decreased expression of TRIM8
could be another mechanism to inhibit p53 function in
RCC. Interestingly, TRIM8 expression recovery makes
the RCC cells more sensitive to chemotherapy (Figure
4A-B). The molecular mechanism of such recovery relies
on a TRIM8-mediated displacement of MDM2 from p53
(Figure 5), thus preventing p53 proteasome degradation.
In RCC cell lines, differently from other cell lines [22],
TRIM8 did not promote MDM2 degradation, involving
other unknown mechanisms (Figure 4B). In this case it
is plausible to envision that when TRIM8 is expressed
in cells and supports p53 activation and phosphorylation
upon genotoxic stimuli, MDM2 may not preside to its
degradation any longer and be totally re-directed towards
other oncogenic targets. Indeed, there is a variety of
molecular targets that have been identified because of
their altered expression levels in ccRCC, which may be
important for tumour development and/or progression,
thus becoming potential targets for specific therapies
created to combat these alterations. Not surprisingly, some
known molecular markers of ccRCC include hypoxiainducible factors (HIFs) - that in normal conditions are
negatively regulated by VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) tumour
suppressor protein and positively by the mammalian
Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) [41, 42] - and their
transcriptional targets, notably those encoding vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), transforming growth
factor α (TGFα), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), all involved in
cell proliferation and survival [43, 44]. The hypothesis
that MDM2 activity, after TRIM8 over-expression, could
be directed towards oncogenic targets is supported by
the finding that p53 promotes MDM2-mediated HIF1α
degradation [45-48]. Some of the products encoded by
these genes represent the main target of new therapies
aimed at inhibiting tumour growth acting mainly on
angiogenesis and mTOR pathway.
Many researchers have suggested the strategy of
reactivating p53 in cancer cells as a promising treatment
option [8]. Current p53-based therapeutic strategies
focus on ectopic expression of wild-type p53 in p53-null
tumours or restoration of the p53 pathway in tumours in
which p53 is incapacitated by alterations of other pathway
components [9]. The latter approach greatly expands the
options in target selection for therapeutic intervention
and the first studies performed with mouse models able
to restore p53 activity by means of a genetic switch have
shown that this strategy can lead to regression of tumours
and increased survival of the animal [49-51]. Moreover,
in some cases, the reactivation of the p53 pathway can
be confined exclusively to cancer cells without affecting
normal tissue, hence limiting side effects [7]. Among the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

different strategies for restoring p53 function, targeting
the MDM2-p53 interaction by small molecules is one of
the most investigated. Hence, one strategy to reactivate
p53 in tumour types harbouring a wild-type p53 is to
force the stabilization of p53 protein by liberating it
from the negative control of MDM2. So far, several
potential therapeutic agents able to interfere with the
MDM2-p53 interaction by different mechanisms, such as
Nutlins, benzodiazepines, RITA (Reactivation of p53 and
Induction of Tumour cell Apoptosis), spiro-oxindoles and
quinolinols, have been developed [27, 28, 30, 52-56]. In
this frame it is noteworthy that the recovery of the cellular
protein TRIM8 reactivates the p53 pathway upon drugs
treatment in RCC cell line, because it prevents MDM2
binding to p53, as we have here shown.
In conclusion in the current study, we analyse for
the first time how TRIM8 expression levels may influence
the cellular response to chemotherapeutic drugs. We found
that TRIM8 is dramatically down regulated in clear cell
renal carcinoma (ccRCC), an aggressive drug-resistant
cancer showing wild type p53. Interestingly, we showed
that TRIM8 expression recovery in two different RCC
cell lines renders these cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic
treatments, strongly supporting the role of TRIM8 in
strengthening the p53-mediated response.
Altogether our findings suggest that ccRCC can be
successfully sensitized to conventional chemotherapy if
combined with modalities designed to reactive p53, and
more broadly TRIM8 could be considered a new target for
therapeutic intervention in cancers where p53 is wild type
and its pathway is defective.

quality was determined by running aliquots on the 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Cell proliferation assays by MTT reduction
1 x 105 cells were plated in six-well plates. After
treatments, 200 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) were added
to the cells for 4h at 37°C. The medium was then removed
and the reduced blue formazan crystals were resuspended
in isopropanol prior to reading the absorbance at 580 nm.

Gene dosage analysis

Protein extraction from tissues and cell lines and
Western blot analysis

Two regions (region 1 - hg19 chr10:104409824104409964; region 2 - hg19 chr10:104417047104417193) of the TRIM8 gene and one region (hg19
chr3:189590756-189590945) of the TP63 gene of the
HK-2 and RCC (both Shaw and Elthem) DNA were
amplified by quantitative PCR using SYBR® Select
Master Mix (Life TechnologiesTM). qPCR reactions were
carried out in triplicate using the ABI PRISM 7900HT
platform (Applied Biosystems®, Life TechnologiesTM)
using 50 ng of input DNA template for all cell lines. No
template controls were included as negative controls for
each primer pair (primers sequences are reported in Table
1). Amplification parameters were as follows: hot start
at 95°C for 15 min; 50 amplification cycles (94°C for 15
sec, 62°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec); dissociation curve
step (95° C for 15 sec, 60°C for 15 sec, 95°C for 15 sec).
Fluorescence raw data were exported from the SDS 2.2.1
software (Applied Biosystems®, Life TechnologiesTM)
and analysed with the DART-PCR Excel workbook
[58]. Actual amplification efficiency values (E) for each
amplicon were used to correct Cq values before analysing
these data by the ΔCq method to compare relative gene
quantity.
Two-tailed Student’s T tests were performed to
assess the statistical significance of differences in DNA
content for each locus analyzed. In this study, a p-value of
less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed by Analysis ToolPak
in Microsoft Excel 2010 software.

Tissue samples were homogenate in ice-cold sample
buffer (8M urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mM Tris-base, 65 mM
DTT containing a protease inhibitor cocktail) and after 30
minutes incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged at
13000 x g at 4°C. The surnatants were collected in new
tubes and protein content was assayed by the Bradford
dye-binding method (BioRad Protein assay).
Cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes at a
density of 5x105 cells/ml. After treatments, cells were
lysed and extracted as previously described [57].
For immunoblotting, the following primary
antibodies were used: p53 specific DO-1 (Santa
Cruz, California, USA 1:300), p53-Ser15P (Santa
Cruz, California, USA 1:100), p53-Ser20P (Santa
Cruz, California, USA 1:100), MDM2 specific 2A10
(Calbiochem 1:400), p21 specific C-19 (Santa Cruz,
1:200), TRIM8 specific C-20 (Santa Cruz, California,
USA 1:200), Anti-HA (Bethyl Laboratories, 1:1000),
Anti-Actin Ab-1 antibodies kit (Calbiochem, 1:2000).
Bound primary antibodies were visualized using LumiLight Western Blotting Substrate (Roche™) on a UVITEC
Cambridge Camera.

RNA extraction from patients and cell lines

each TaqMan assay.
Amplification parameters were as follows: hot start
at 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles of amplification (94°C for
15 sec, 60°C for 1 min). Results were first analysed in
SDS 2.2.1 software and then exported in Microsoft Excel
in order to be further analysed by using geNorm which
outputted ACTB and RPL13 as best housekeeping genes
for these samples.
qRT-PCR experiments were performed on ccRCC
and renal oncocytoma samples and on HK-2 and
RCC cell lines to measure TRIM8 expression by using
TaqMan® assay Hs00229451_m1. Expression levels were
calculated relative to the mean expression levels of ACTB
and RPL13 genes, according to the following formula:
relative Expression Ratio (rER) = 2^{(CqTRIM8 – [(CqACTB
+ CqRPL13)/2]}. The reported data represent the average of
at least two independent experiments and are shown with
their standard errors.
Two-tailed Student’s T tests were performed to
assess the statistical significance of gene expression
levels differences observed between the normal and the
ccRCC/RO samples (and also among the different grades
of ccRCC) and the effects of Nutlin-3 or Cisplatin, in
presence or in absence of TRIM8 over-expression, in
HK-2 and RCC cells. In this study, a p-value of less than
0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Tumour and paired adjacent non-tumour renal
parenchyma samples from a total of 24 patients were
used for this work. Immediately after surgery, tissues
were separately stored and frozen at -80°C according to
a standard procedure. From histological examination,
20 samples were classified as clear cell RCCs (10 males
and 10 females; mean age: 63 ± 10.8 years) and 4 were
oncocytomas (all males; mean age: 63.25 ± 4.86 years)
(Table 2).
Furthermore, the pathological staging was
determined according to the latest TNM classification
and grading according to Fuhrman, as reported in Table 2.
Informed consent to take part in this study was obtained
from all the patients. The study was approved by the
Hospital’s Ethics Committee.
Collected ccRCC samples were processed for
total RNA extraction from 50-100 mg of fresh frozen
tissue using the TRIzol reagent (InvitrogenTM, Life
TechnologiesTM). All RNA samples were purified
using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen®) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For HK-2 and RCC cell lines,
total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini
kit (Qiagen). Purified RNA was then quantified using the
NanoDropTM 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific)
and RNA quality was determined by running aliquots on
the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Reverse transcription of 500 ng of total RNA was
performed using QuantiTect® Reverse Transcription kit
(Qiagen®). Control reverse transcription reactions without
RT enzyme were also prepared and controlled by PCR for
gDNA contamination.
Particular attention was paid to the choice of
housekeeping genes. The geNorm VBA applet for
Microsoft Excel was used to determine the most stable
housekeeping genes for ccRCC and renal oncocytoma
samples used in this study from a panel of five reference
genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1 and RPL13) in 8
of the 18 ccRCC and all renal oncocytoma sample pairs
used in qRT-PCR experiments, as previously described.59
For the geNorm analysis, qRT-PCR experiments were
performed in duplicate on the ABI PRISM 7900HT
platform (Applied Biosystems®, Life TechnologiesTM)
using 1.5μl cDNA as template for each reaction
with TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems®, Life TechnologiesTM). TaqMan assays from
Applied Biosystems® were used for the amplification of
ACTB (Hs99999903_m1), B2M (Hs99999907_m1),
GADPH (Hs99999905_m1), HPRT1 (Hs03929098_m1)
and RPL13 (Hs00761672_s1) transcripts. No template
controls (NTCs) were included as negative controls for
