Safety concerns surrounding the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo)
to treat anemia in cancer patients were raised after 2 recent clinical studies
reported a worse survival outcome in patients who received epoetin a or epoetin
b compared with patients who received placebo. Although those findings contrasted with previous clinical studies, which demonstrated no difference in survival for cancer patients who received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs),
some investigators have suggested a potential role for ESAs in promoting tumor

growth through 1) stimulation of Epo receptors (EpoR) expressed in tumors, 2)
stimulation and formation of tumor vessels, and/or 3) enhanced tumor oxygenation. The first and second hypotheses appeared to be supported by some EpoR
expression and ESA in vitro studies. However, these conclusions have been challenged because of poor specificity of EpoR-detection methodologies, conflicting
data from different groups, and the lack of correlation between in vitro data and
in vivo findings in animal tumor models. For this report, the authors reviewed
the biology of EpoR in erythropoiesis and compared and contrasted the reported
findings on the role of ESAs and EpoR in tumors. Cancer 2007;110:477–88.

oncerns that recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) may
adversely affect the survival of cancer patients through promoting tumor growth recently were raised by 2 randomized clinical
trials that used rHuEpo to prevent anemia in patients with breast or
head and neck cancer.1,2 In those trials, decreased survival and
increased tumor progression were observed in patients who received
epoetin a or epoetin b compared with patients who received placebo. These outcomes were in contrast to many clinical trials, which
demonstrated that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are safe
and efficacious for the treatment of anemia in cancer patients.3,4
These trials were criticized for poor study design and execution.4
However, a number of hypotheses were proposed to explain the
potential role of ESAs in promoting tumor proliferation and reduced
survival including, stimulation of tumor expression of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR), tumor neovascularization, enhanced
tumor oxygenation, and, most recently, the role of coadministered
iron,5 although that topic is not addressed herein.
This review reflects conclusions from a comprehensive survey of
the literature that investigated the expression and function of EpoR

in primary tumors and in transformed cell lines and
endothelial cells. Multiple broad searches of the biologic and medical literature were performed on the
Ovid system using multiple databases. Many of the
citations described the effects of ESAs related to receptor expression and signaling, tumor cell proliferation, tumor growth, or tumor progression. The
majority of the articles supported 1 of 2 themes: 1) a
protumor-promoting effect of ESAs and 2) no tumorpromoting effect and/or an antitumor effect of ESAs.

Biology of EpoR
EpoR is a type-1, single-transmembrane receptor
that is expressed as several forms in erythropoietic
progenitor cells, including a full-length form (F-EpoR),
a truncated form (T-EpoR), and a soluble form (SEpoR). T-EpoR and S-EpoR contain the extracellular
Epo-binding domain, but alternative splicing of transcripts truncates the cytoplasmic or transmembrane
domains (Fig. 1A,B).6 T-EpoR knock-in and transgenic
mice had sustained erythropoiesis; however, erythroid
progenitor survival and proliferation at low concentrations of Epo and during stress-induced erythropoiesis
were severely compromised.7,8 It has been reported
that S-EpoR acts as an antagonist in neuronal tissues
by competing with F-EpoR for binding to erythropoietin.9 The physiological roles for these EpoR variants
have not been established.
Translocation of EpoR to the cell surface is an
inefficient process, resulting in <1% of total cellular
F-EpoR molecules reaching the cell surface of hematopoietic cells. This is a consequence of the short
half-life of EpoR protein (1–2 hours), inefficient processing for surface expression, and protein degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum, proteosome,
and lysosomes.10–14 Accessory factors that are
required for EpoR trafficking to the surface also may
be at limiting concentrations. For example, Epo-dependent and Epo-independent subclones of a hematopoietic cell line reportedly expressed EPOR
transcripts and protein, but only Epo-dependent
clones expressed surface receptor.15 In addition,
enforced expression of EPOR messenger RNA in a
human hematopoietic cell line did not increase total
surface EpoR protein.16 One such accessory protein,
Janus kinase-2 (Jak2), binds EpoR in the endoplasmic
reticulum, induces correct protein folding, promotes
surface expression in hematopoietic cells, and is
essential for EpoR signaling.17
Epo or ESAs binding to EpoR homodimers activates Jak2, inducing a signaling cascade to promote
erythroid progenitor survival, proliferation, and differentiation (for review, see Wojchowski et al.18) (Fig. 2).
Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase

1 (SHP-1) and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)
proteins CIS, SOCS-1, and SOCS-319,20 are negative regulators of EpoR signaling. Absence of negative regulation of EpoR signaling is associated with familial
erythrocytosis because of cytoplasmic truncations of
EpoR that remove suppressor binding sites.21,22

EpoR Expression and Signaling in Tumors
EPOR transcription
Tumor cell lines and tumor tissues derived from
neoplasias of the breast,23–26 kidney,25,27 colon,25,26
stomach,26 pancreas,25,26 prostate,25,26,28 female reproductive organs,25,26,29–31 liver,25,32 lung,26 brain,25,32
melanocytes,25,26,33,34 and head and neck35 and from
hematopoietic neoplasias25,26 reportedly were capable
of transcribing the EPOR gene (as determined by nonquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction [RT-PCR] analysis), and it has been suggested
that this expression is indicative of a potential role in
tumor progression. One study reported that 20 of 23
tumor cell lines expressed EPOR transcripts and correlated with immunostaining of EpoR protein in most
cell lines.25 However, in a urinary bladder carcinoma
cell line and in immortalized keratinocytes, no EPOR
transcripts were detected, although the tumor cell
lines reportedly were positive for EpoR protein. These
discrepancies may have resulted from the lack of
specificity of the anti-EpoR antibody used in that
study. The methods used in these RT-PCR studies do
not distinguish between the different splice variants
of EpoR; thus, it is not clear whether functional EpoR
is expressed in these cells. Indeed, high levels of alternatively spliced transcripts that encode attenuated or
antagonistic EpoR forms have been reported in tumor
cell lines.36
Using real-time, quantitative RT-PCR, EPOR transcripts have been detected in normal tissues, including kidney, heart, brain, endothelium, and smooth
muscle,37 but are at significantly lower levels than
the levels detected in bone marrow that contains the
Epo-responsive erythroid progenitors. Similarly,
EPOR transcript levels in breast, colon, lung, lymphoma, ovary, prostate, stomach, ileum, and kidney
tumor tissues and tumor cell lines also were significantly lower than the transcript levels in bone marrow and were no higher than the levels observed in
normal counterpart tissues.38 It also was reported
that EPOR transcript levels were at equivalent levels
in matched tumor and nontumor samples from
patients with lung or colon cancer.38 These findings
are in concordance with reports by other groups that
have used semiquantitative means to evaluate EPOR
transcription. For example, EPOR transcripts in neoplastic prostate were equivalent to levels in normal

EPOR transcript levels in tumor cells are not elevated
above the levels observed in normal tissues, thus
suggesting that there is no selective advantage for
tumors to overexpress the EPOR gene.

Most studies that have reported high levels EpoR
protein expression in tumors have used commercially available antibodies in immunoblotting and

and confusion over the identity of the EpoR protein.
The reported sizes of EpoR using commercial antiEpoR antibodies ranged from 66 kilodaltons (kD) to
78 kD. However, the calculated size of the EpoR protein is 52.6 kD, and maturation with the addition of
carbohydrate could increase the size to approximately 57 kD. However, when a tagged EpoR was
overexpressed, antibodies against the protein tag and
EpoR identified EpoR that was 59 kD.41,42 This was
confirmed further by protein microsequencing.41 All
commercial anti-EpoR antibodies detected multiple
proteins (up to 20 different bands) that differed in
size compared with EpoR.41 The commonly used
Santa Cruz polyclonal antibody C-20 detected a 66kD band, which investigators believed was EpoR;
however, when the 66-kD band detected by C-20 was
protein sequenced, no EpoR peptides were identified.41 Heat-shock proteins (HSP) with homology to
the EpoR peptide used to generate the C-20 antibody
were identified in the 66-kD band, and HSP70 peptides were able specifically to block binding of C-20
to the 66-kD protein41 and reduced or abolished
immunoreactivity of C-20 to nonsmall cell lung carcinoma tumor sections.43 This finding of cross-reactivity to non-EpoR proteins was not surprising,
because the various antibody preparations contain
polyclonal antipeptide antibodies. It is noteworthy
that HSP70 is a potent survival factor for cells under
stress; it is highly expressed in tumors; it is associated with metastasis, poor prognosis, and resist-

ance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy; and it
increases the tumorigenicity of cancer cells in animal
models (for review, see Schmitt et al.44). Therefore, a
recent C-20 EpoR expression study suggesting that
EpoR expression in tissue sections was correlated
with tumor progression and worse survival45 may
have identified an association between the expression of HSP and prognosis.
A limited number of studies have used Epo-binding assays to investigate the presence of EpoR on the
surface of tumor lines.27,46,47 In the tumor lines in
which binding was reported, the binding affinity of
EpoR was substantially lower than the binding affinity to primary erythroid progenitors and cell
lines.27,46–50 A rat pheochromocytoma cell line
reportedly expressed EpoR with a binding affinity
that was 160-fold lower than what was reported previously for EpoR on hematopoietic cells,46 the significance of which is uncertain. Other studies have
reported no or extremely low levels of surface EpoR
(17 Epo binding sites)38,51,52 on tumor cell lines.
This was despite the finding that F-EpoR protein was
detected by immunoblot analysis, in 1 instance at
levels equivalent to those detected in hematopoietic
cells.38,51 Thus, EpoR protein may be synthesized but
may not be transported to the cell surface at detectable levels or at low levels because of limiting accessory trafficking factors.

EpoR signaling
Some in vitro studies have reported a general
increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in cell lines
when exposed to suprapharmacologic doses of
rHuEpo. It was suggested that this was a protumorogenic effect, but no specific pathways were determined.23,29 It was reported that rHuEpo induced
modest translocation of nuclear factor jB (NF-jB) to
the nucleus and up-regulation of antiapoptotic gene
transcription. Again, it was suggested that this was
indicative of a survival response, although no survival studies were performed.32 These data were contradicted by the finding that rHuEpo inhibited NFjB-induced antiapoptotic gene transcription in cell
lines to enhance chemotherapy-induced cell death.53
None of those studies used appropriate vehicle controls; therefore, the results obtained may have been
because of non-Epo proteins that were present in the
diluent.
Although it was concluded in a xenograft study
in vivo that Epo-EpoR interaction activated signal
transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in
tumors, no signaling occurred in the parental cell
lines in vitro.26 Because STAT5 is activated not only
by Epo but also by numerous other cytokines (for

EpoR Expression and Function in Tumors/Sinclair et al.

review, see Seidel et al.54), the significance and relevance of these data to Epo-EpoR signaling are
unclear. In an attempt to address the specificity of
response, the investigators injected S-EpoR and antiEpo antibodies directly into tumors in ex-vivo organ
cultures. They reported that Jak2 and STAT5 signaling
were reduced because of the inhibition of autocrine
or paracrine Epo-EpoR signaling in tumors.30 Multiple sequential injections with large quantities of SEpoR protein (0.3–1.6 lg/mg) and anti-Epo antibodies (32 lg/mg) into the tumors were required to
achieve a reduction in phosphorylated STAT5 from 0
to approximately10-fold. The lack of appropriate negative controls, such as antibody isotypes or irrelevant
protein controls, limits the ability to reach definitive
conclusions from that study. In summary, experiments
that analyze isolated signaling pathways ex vivo are
difficult to interpret in terms of their physiologic or
pathologic significance, because they are complicated
by confounding influences, such as the presence of
additional growth factors, hypoxia, the presence of
endotoxins in recombinant proteins, and potential
off-target effects of antibodies or soluble receptors,
especially when they are used at high doses.

In Vitro Functional Studies
Tumor cell line proliferation in response to rHuEpo
Studies that assess the biologic response of tumor
cell lines to rHuEpo may be more informative than
those that measure only intracellular and cell-surface
expression of EpoR or EpoR signaling pathways.
Numerous investigators have assessed the proliferation of tumor cell lines in response to rHuEpo in
vitro (Table 1). Pharmacologic levels of serum
rHuEpo are approximately 1 U/mL after subcutaneous administration of a single dose of 600 U/kg (at
the high end of recommended therapeutic dosing).55
Concentrations of rHuEpo up to 1000-fold greater
than those used clinically did not lead to proliferation of 6 transformed cell lines, including those
derived from breast, pancreatic, prostate, renal, and
myelogenous tumors (in vitro treatment with rHuEpo
up to 1000 U/mL), even though EpoR transcripts and
protein reportedly were detected in each cell line.25
Likewise, in 8 other studies,56–63 there was no
observed biologic response to rHuEpo, as measured
by proliferation or clonogenic growth in 68 tumor
cell lines. Although several of those studies did not
investigate whether tumor cell lines expressed surface EpoR, 1 study reported that cell lines that
expressed surface EpoR could not be induced to proliferate when they were exposed to rHuEpo.58 Selzer
et al. reported that 50% of spontaneously transformed melanocyte lines expressed EpoR but that

481

their growth characteristics in culture were no different than cell lines that did not express the receptor.33
In contrast, proliferation of tumor cells in response
rHuEpo has been reported in other studies.23,64 However, the biologic significance of these data is uncertain
for a number of reasons. First, the increase in proliferation was within the range of the background noise
observed in typical cell proliferation assays. Second, no
dose/response relations were established. Furthermore,
the proliferative response observed in a breast tumor
cell line23 was not observed in 4 other studies that used
the same cell line.56,57,59,60 To date, there appear to be
only 2 studies that have investigated the relation
between rHuEpo dose and tumor cell line proliferation.27,28 In those studies, the proliferation of a murine
cell line and 7 human renal and prostate cell lines
increased 1.25 to approximately 4-fold after treatment
with 0.5 U/mL to 100 U/mL rHuEpo in both serum-free
and serum-containing media.27,28 The absence of vehicle controls and the general use of suprapharmacologic
doses of rHuEpo in those studies limits their usefulness.
These data contrast with the effect of rHuEpo on an erythroid cell line, in which pharmacologically relevant
doses between 0.01 U/mL and 0.4 U/mL rHuEpo stimulated a 650% increase in proliferation.65

Tumor cell line survival in response to rHuEpo
Another proposed mechanism of Epo action on tumor cells is the inhibition of apoptosis. Studies29
reported that rHuEpo (25–200 U/mL) in combination
with cisplatin improved HeLa cell survival by
approximately 5% to 60% compared with cisplatin
alone. However, only 10% of the cell death induced
by cisplatin was attributed to apoptosis, and 200 U/
mL rHuEpo (a concentration never achieved in
humans) appeared to have a maximal effect that
only reduced this apoptotic fraction to 5%. Treatment of hematopoietic EpoR-expressing 32D cells
with rHuEpo (5 U/mL) reportedly suppressed cisplatin-induced growth arrest and apoptosis at 24 hours
but, subsequently, resulted in increased necrotic cell
death when cell cultures were monitored for longer
periods.66 Suprapharmacologic levels of rHuEpo (>1
U/mL, the maximum concentration observed with
rHuEPO in clinical studies) were required to observe
these effects. In similar studies, the addition of
rHuEpo (30 U/mL) to U87 glioblastoma and HT100
cervical carcinoma tumor cell lines reportedly made
the cells more resistant to ionizing radiation and cisplatin, although no EpoR-mediated signaling was
investigated.67 In contrast to those reports, other
investigators have observed that the magnitude of cell
killing by cisplatin in a variety of cell lines that were
pretreated with rHuEpo (10 U/mL) was not reduced

compared with treatment using cisplatin alone.58 This
was not because the cells were unresponsive to
rHuEpo, because activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was reported.58 Taken together, the results
from studies that investigated the protective effects of
rHuEpo on tumor cells in vitro are conflicting.

ESAs in Animal Models of Tumor Growth
Erythropoietins in animal tumor models
Animal models are more indicative of a physiological
role of ESAs on tumor growth. The in vivo tumor
model studies with ESA treatment generally can be
grouped into 1 of 3 categories: 1) tumor regression,
2) enhancement of tumor-ablative therapies, and 3) no
enhancement of tumor-ablative therapies (Table 2). In
all 23 in vivo studies, ESA administration alone had no
tumor-promoting effect.
In some (but not all) studies, ESAs reportedly
restored the effectiveness of radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy, and chemotherapy in anemic animals that had tumors (Table 2). For example, severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing
small, subcutaneous ovarian tumors showed a significant decrease in tumor progression after treatment

with rHuEpo plus cisplatin compared with control
animals.68 In contrast, rats bearing tumors that
reportedly expressed and signaled through Epo-EpoR
did not demonstrate an enhanced tumor-ablative
effect with chemotherapy.69 There was no enhanced
tumor promotion in the presence or absence of
chemotherapy. In another setting, rHuEpo reportedly
induced tumor regression in a murine model of myeloma by provoking an antitumor immune
response.70 The same investigators recently reported
prolonged survival in 6 patients with advanced multiple myeloma when they received rHuEpo with or
without chemotherapy.71
Others explored rHuEpo in combination with
fractionated radiation in a murine cancer cachexia
model: They concluded that rHuEpo had a beneficial
effect by contributing to radiosensitization and/or
reducing weight loss.72,73 In contrast, no radiosensitizing effect was observed in a rat tumor model with
darbepoetin alpha (DA) at a high dose, even though
there was an increase in tumor oxygenation.74 Therefore, the data surrounding tumor effects of ESAs
were consistent in all models: There was no evidence
of tumor enhancement. However, the ability of ESAs

to enhance the effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy was observed inconsistently.
One group reported that epoetin b had no
effect on tumor growth alone but slightly increased
tumor growth in a nonvalidated transection model
of mock surgery.75 The relevance of that study is
unclear based on the nonvalidated model that was
used.

EpoR agonists or antagonists in tumor growth models
Some investigators have utilized anti-Epo antibodies
or soluble EpoR to treat tumors in nude mice or rats
to investigate the role of the Epo-EpoR axis. Injection
of an anti-Epo antibody or soluble EpoR directly into
female reproductive organ-derived tumors in nude
mice reportedly reduced tumor size.31 It has been
suggested that tumor regression is related to apoptotic death of tumor and capillary endothelial cells.
The relevance of these results is unclear, because

essential controls were lacking: No isotype or irrelevant protein controls were examined, and no inhibition of EpoR signaling was investigated or
documented. In subsequent experiments, several tumor cell lines were transplanted into nude mice and
treated with the Epo antagonistic (EMP-9) and agonistic (EMP-1) peptides.26 Administration of EMP-9
to mice with stomach choriocarcinoma or melanoma
xenografts reportedly inhibited angiogenesis and tumor cell survival; opposite effects were reported with
EMP-1. The results have been challenged on theoretical grounds because of the low in vivo potency of
EMP-1 (compared with rHuEpo, its erythropoietic activity is reduced >65,000-fold76) and lack of hematocrit changes in animals that were administered EMP1 or EMP-9 compared with control animals that
received saline.26 Thus, it is not clear whether tumor
effects unrelated to EpoR agonism or antagonism
account for these results.

Local injection of anti-Epo antibodies, soluble
EpoR, and the Jak2 antagonist AG490 reportedly
increased the death of syngenic tumors in rats.24
Those data are difficult to interpret, because essential
controls were not included: Matched antibody isotype and unrelated soluble receptor controls were
not performed. Furthermore, AG490 is not specific to
Jak2 and is a more potent antagonist of EGFR
(approximately 100-fold),77,78 and it also is active on
Bcr-Abl,79 Her2,77 and Jak3.80

Overexpression of Epo in Mice and Humans
Biologic disorders that alter the levels of Epo in
humans and animals provide additional insights into
the potential role of ESAs in tumor induction or progression. Both primary congenital disorders associated with increased Epo production and mutations
in EPOR that lead to hypersensitivity to Epo are associated with erythrocytosis in humans.21,81 However, a
greater cancer incidence has not been observed in
patients with familial and congenital polycythemias.
Transgenic mice have been developed that express
high levels of Epo.82 There was no increase in tumorigenesis, including erythroleukemia, in those animals
after 2 years of observation.
Epo in Tumor Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis
EpoR expression has been reported in neovessels in
explanted human myocardium,83 chick chorioallantoic
membrane,40 human umbilical cord,84 human placenta,84 tumor xenograft models, and primary human
tumors.26,30,85 However, most of those studies should be
viewed with caution, because they relied on immunoblot
or immunohistochemistry analyses that used nonspecific anti-EpoR antibodies (described above). However,
using Epo-binding studies, cultured endothelial cells
reportedly expressed between 10,000 and 27,000 lowaffinity (Kd 860 to 3800 pM) receptors per cell.48,86
In vitro, rHuEpo reportedly stimulated the proliferation of primary endothelial cells48,86 and endothelial cell
lines.40 It is noteworthy that high doses of rHuEpo
(10 U/mL and 30 U/mL) induced the release of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in some cultured tumor cell lines,32 and it has been suggested that VEGF
acts in a comitogenic fashion with rHuEpo.87 Endothelial migration in response to rHuEpo also has been
reported48 in addition to endothelial cord formation in
primary and immortalized endothelial cell lines40 and
capillary sprouting from explanted human myocardium
and aortic rings.83
In vivo, using both rat mammary adenocarcinoma and mouse colon carcinoma models, no difference was reported in angiogenesis between rHuEpotreated and placebo-treated tumors.88 The effect of

rHuEpo on tumor vascular density also was examined in 2 different glioma xenograft models, and no
increased density was noted.72 In addition, there
were no morphologic alterations in blood vessels in
the treated tumors. However, recent xenograft studies
have suggested that rHuEpo, used at therapeutically
relevant doses, acts on tumor endothelial cells to
enhance tumor shrinkage in the presence of chemotherapy, potentially by increasing the bioavailability
of anticancer drugs.89 Therefore, rHuEPO may provide a beneficial therapeutic effect when combined
with chemotherapy.
Several studies have suggested that rHuEpo can
modestly mobilize endothelial progenitor cells
(EPCs) from the bone marrow to peripheral blood to
promote neovessel development.90,91 However, the
true identification of EPCs92 and the correlation
between circulating EPC levels and tumor growth
remain quite controversial. In some studies, bone
marrow-derived EPCs differentiated into mature endothelial cells and were incorporated into the tumor
vasculature of animals.93 In other studies, bone marrow EPCs did not contribute to tumor vasculature in
mice94 and also reportedly were infrequent in
humans, contributing to <5% of the tumor vascular
endothelium.95 Therefore, if rHuEpo mobilized EPCs,
then the extent would be modest: The significance of
this mobilization is uncertain, and additional factors
may play a role in disease settings.

Tumor Oxygenation
Cellular response to hypoxia includes significant
changes in gene expression that are believed to contribute to cellular resistance to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy and may increase malignancy potential through gene amplification and mutation.
Indeed, it was observed that patients who have
tumors with lower oxygen pressure had significantly
worse disease-free and overall survival, largely
because of locoregional failures.96 It has been proposed that these tumor changes occur through the
induction of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a)
system (for review, see Leo et al.97). However, these
findings conflict with the observation that patients
with Chuvash polycythemia had high levels of HIF1a expression (through acquisition of VHL protein
mutations) but did not have an apparent increase in
tumor incidence.81 These findings suggest that factors other than HIF-1a contribute to tumor initiation,
but hypoxia may play a role in tumor progression.
It has been hypothesized that anemia contributes to the problem of tumor hypoxia and increases
the relative risk of death.98 Studies investigating the
use of ESAs to alleviate the problems of anemia and

EpoR Expression and Function in Tumors/Sinclair et al.

hypoxia in preclinical animal models have reported
that rHuEPO improved tumor oxygenation in xenograft models72,99,100 but also in a mechanism that
was independent of its hemoglobin-raising effects.101
DA corrected anemia in tumor-bearing mice and
sensitized tumor cells to radiation therapy.100 However, a sensitizing effect also was observed when DA
was given 2 hours before radiation therapy, before an
effect on hemoglobin could occur.100 Conversely, in
other studies, the tumor-sensitization effect was not
observed in nonanemic rat tumor models even
though tumor oxygenation was improved.74 Therefore, there was inconsistent evidence of the ability of
ESAs to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in preclinical tumor models.

Conclusions
Numerous investigators have reported EpoR expression in tumors and have assumed a negative impact
on tumor progression and survival. However, many of
the findings and conclusions of these studies are questionable because of problems with the methods that
were used to detect EpoR protein, lack of appropriate
controls, and lack of detection of physiologically relevant surface EpoR on tumor cells. The evidence that
ESAs confer a proliferative or survival advantage for tumor cells is not compelling. For tumor cell lines that
responded to rHuEpo in vitro, either the response was
marginal and/or suprapharmacologic levels of rHuEpo
were required to evoke a biologic response. In contrast,
many tumor cell lines do not respond to rHuEpo, even
when EpoR is expressed. These findings may reflect a
possible absence of intracellular signaling after ligandreceptor interaction, low EpoR density, or nonfunctional EpoR at the cell surface in tumor cell lines. Of
most physiological relevance are in vivo tumor studies,
some of which have demonstrated that treatment with
ESAs reduced tumor growth through radiosensitization, reduced hypoxia, or enhanced tumor immunity.
Most noteworthy, at as of the time that this article was
written, no animal in vivo tumor study has demonstrated that ESAs treatment alone enhances tumor
progression or decreases survival. The on-going, wellcontrolled clinical trials will clarify whether the use of
ESAs in anemic cancer patients is safe.
