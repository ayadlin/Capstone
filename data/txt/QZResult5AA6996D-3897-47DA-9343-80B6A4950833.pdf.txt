The Dark Side of E2F1: In Transit beyond Apoptosis
€tzer
David Engelmann and Brigitte M. Pu

Abstract
E2F1 plays a critical role in cell-cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage.
The latest evidence has uncovered that this tumor suppressor is most relevant for cancer progression and
chemoresistance. Increased abundance of E2F1 triggers invasion and metastasis by activating growth receptor
signaling pathways, which in turn promote an antiapoptotic tumor environment. The data shed light on the
molecular mechanisms underlying E2F1-induced prometastatic activity and predict its radical switch from a
mediator of cell death toward an accelerator of tumor progression. This raises the perspective of new drug targets
at late-stage cancer. Cancer Res; 72(3); 571–5. Ó2012 AACR.

Expanding the E2F Paradigm
More than 2 decades of experimentation link E2F activity to
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB)–dependent cell-cycle
control. E2F proteins are situated downstream of growth factor
signaling cascades, where they regulate genes required for cellcycle progression by acting either as transcriptional activators
or as repressors. Activating members of the E2F family (E2F1-3)
can contribute to oncogenic transformation of rodent embryonic ﬁbroblasts and tumorigenesis when overexpressed. The
absence of activating E2Fs in ﬂies or mammalian ﬁbroblasts
causes cell-cycle arrest, but this block is alleviated by removing
repressive E2F or the tumor suppressor p53. The idea that E2F
function is indispensible for cell proliferation is under debate
and has dominated discussions for years.
Recent work from Chen and colleagues in knockout mouse
models is challenging the current E2F paradigm. The researchers showed that in retinal progenitor cells deﬁcient for
all activating E2Fs, proliferation is bypassed by MYCN (1).
Instead, activating E2Fs have an unexpected prosurvival role
during retinal development via induction of the apoptosis
inhibitory Sirt1-p53 axis. Similar results were obtained from
transgenic mice with conditional E2F triple deﬁciency in
embryonic stem cells. Thus, E2F1-3 function is, contrary to
the current view, expendable for cell division in the majority of
cell types present during organ development and embryogenesis, but it is necessary for suppressing cell death (2). Although
these studies were accomplished in normal tissues, they might
teach us a lesson about the role of E2Fs in cancer. On the basis

of recently published research, we should challenge the prevailing view that cell proliferation is the major and most
important oncogenic mechanism of E2Fs. Even if this function
may have evolved during tumor development, we are only
beginning to understand how E2F family proteins participate
in other, as yet uncharted, biologic processes that contribute
to tumor promotion and, more importantly, to tumor
progression.

Switching Duties: A Tumor Suppressor
Contributes to Cancer Progression
In the past, E2F1 in particular was recognized as a strong
regulator of apoptosis after DNA damage in all types of human
cancer (3). Most human tumors harbor functionally inactivated
RB, resulting in deregulated E2F1 in the transformed cells. In
this context, E2F1-induced apoptosis signaling is viewed as a
fail-safe mechanism that opposes proliferation and oncogenesis through its capacity to activate the p53/p73 pathway of
intrinsic cell death. Whether the balance of E2F1 activity in a
speciﬁc tissue inhibits or promotes tumorigenesis is most
likely dependent upon the context of pro- versus antiapoptotic
signals received by cells at a given time. It has been shown that
tumor cells, especially from advanced lesions, exhibit severe
defects in the cell death pathways that are normally activated
by E2F1, which may otherwise select against apoptotic consequences of deregulated E2F1 in the absence of RB (4). The
ﬁrst evidence indicating that RB and oncogenic signals cooperate to suppress E2F1-induced apoptosis came from data on
Drosophila mutant ﬂies (5). Researchers have shown that E2F1
tumor suppressor activity can be prevented by EGFR/Ras/Raf
signaling during normal development. Another critical inhibitor of proapoptotic E2F1 target genes in serum-stimulated
ﬁbroblasts and human tumor cells in vitro is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, also activated by EGFR,
whereas E2F1-regulated genes involved in the proliferative
program are not affected (6). AKT is also a target of E2F1
(7), suggesting the existence of a self-control mechanism by
which E2F1 modulates its own apoptotic activity in favor of an
RB-independent prosurvival response.

Abnormalities in E2F1 gene expression and/or E2F1 gene
ampliﬁcation are seen in many types of human cancer.
Respective studies indicate that increased E2F1 expression
is frequently and predominantly associated with high-grade
tumors or metastases and unfavorable patient survival
prognosis. Lee and colleagues showed that high expression
of E2F1 and its associated target genes predict the change
from superﬁcial to invasive progression of bladder tumors
(8). Together with the ﬁnding that E2F binding sites are
enriched in promoters of genes whose expression is strongly
associated with invasive tumors, the research of Lee and
colleagues suggests that E2F1 is functionally connected to
cancer invasiveness. Further hints that derepression of E2F1
signaling can pave the way for a progressive cancer disease
come from recent studies showing that loss of the RB/E2Fnegative regulator p16 in patients with gastrointestinal
stromal tumors of the stomach has a major impact on
tumor-related survival (9). These correlations can be linked
to the evasion of advanced tumor cells from E2F1-related
apoptosis. Dysregulated E2F1 has been shown in combination with p53 deﬁciency or activated Ras to accelerate
tumorigenesis. Furthermore, reduced expression of genes
belonging to the E2F1 apoptotic program in breast and
ovarian cancer patients coincides with poorer survival outcomes (6). Together, these ﬁndings emphasize the importance of E2F1 signaling as a mechanism for establishing
cancer drug resistance in association with tumor progression and encourage the view that E2F1 has an additional
oncogenic property independent of its ability to simply
stimulate aberrant growth.
Our recent in vivo data provide the ﬁrst functional evidence that E2F1 is crucial in transformed cells for local
invasion and to form distant metastases (10). This study
showed that knockdown of endogenous E2F1 in a metastatic
melanoma model severely reduces the migratory and invasive potential of skin cancer cells, whereas cell proliferation
is not affected. Melanocytic tumors in mice with blocked
E2F1 expression showed a drastic reduction of pulmonary
metastases, indicating that repression of E2F1 is sufﬁcient to
attenuate the ability of melanoma cells to metastasize. Now
the question arises of how E2F1 accomplishes tumor progression and whether this represents a more general paradigm beyond cell-cycle regulation. In malignant melanoma,
E2F1-dependent progression was found to be mediated
through the upregulation of EGFR and activation of the
cytoplasmic Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and PI3K/AKT
signaling cascades, as well as B-Myb transactivation in vitro
(10). It seems that the EGFR ligand HBEGF is also a transcriptional target of E2F1, providing the possibility for
autocrine stimulation of EGFR signaling in aggressive skin
cancer. In support of this ﬁnding, Sharma and colleagues
uncovered the androgen receptor, which is essential for the
initiation and progression of prostate cancer, as a gene
under control of E2F1 in both cultured tumor cells and
xenografts (11). E2F1 was found to bind the androgen
receptor promoter, and this occupancy was enriched in the
absence of RB. In-depth analysis of human castrate-resistant

572

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

prostate cancer metastases revealed that loss of RB during
cancer progression correlates with increased E2F1 and
androgen receptor levels. These data convincingly show that
EGFR and androgen receptor signaling is essential for
malignant cells overexpressing E2F1 to leave their primary
location and open up the possibility that other cellular or
nuclear growth factor receptors might be regulated by E2F1
in other types of cancer (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, a cell cycle–
independent but developmentally relevant role for the RB/
E2F pathway was found for neural precursor migration in
embryonic mouse models (12). Thus, regulation of cell
motility and invasiveness by the RB/E2F pathway in cancer
may reﬂect a physiologic function, which is tightly controlled during organ development and apparently becomes
reactivated during tumor progression.

E2F1-Binding Cofactors and Cancer Progression
Recently, several studies have increased our understanding of the mechanistic control of E2F-driven gene expression
by cofactors that bind E2F1, thereby having a profound
inﬂuence on its ability to mediate tumor progression. One
category of nuclear cofactors acts by enhancing E2F1's
ability to transactivate target gene promoters. Revenko and
colleagues identiﬁed the AAA nuclear coregulator cancerassociated protein (ANCCA) as a coactivator of E2F1 in
human cancer cells. It directly interacts with E2F1 and is
important for target gene expression in vitro (13). ANCCA
preferentially associates with acetylated histones and serves
as a "pioneer" factor for E2F1 by anchoring at speciﬁc
chromatin locations. A clinical study from the same group
correlates high levels of ANCCA with triple-negative breast
cancers, tumor metastasis, disease recurrence, and poor
survival (14). The study revealed that E2F1-regulated oncogenes, such as the polycomb protein EZH2 and B-Myb, are
highly expressed in these tumors, whereas knockdown of
ANCCA leads to their downregulation. Another cofactor of
E2F1 gene expression that is strongly implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression is the nuclear receptor
coactivator 3 (NCOA3), alias ACTR (15). Because both cofactor-encoding genes are also transactivated by E2F1 itself (16,
17), this opens up the feasibility of feedback loops constituting a deadly alliance, rendering tumors more aggressive
and untreatable. Because nuclear EGFR interacts with E2F1,
leading to the activation of B-Myb expression, it may also be
considered as a cofactor, which, as a target of E2F1, facilitates tumor progression partly via triggering E2F1-dependent gene expression. Other data suggest that cofactordriven E2F1 transcriptional activity of genes facilitating
tumor progression can be induced via nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) signaling (18). Arrestin beta 1
(ARRB1) was shown to be translocated into the nucleus
and to be directly associated with E2F1 upon nAChR stimulation by nicotine in lung cancer cells. ARRB1-E2F1 complexes were signiﬁcantly more abundant in non–small cell
lung carcinoma tissue from smokers relative to matched
normal lung tissue. The ARRB1 protein has been shown to
promote multiple steps of cancer progression, including

E2F1 in Tumor Progression

Figure 1. Transition of E2F1 from a tumor suppressor to an inducer of cancer progression. In tumor cells that have lost the RB locus and simultaneously
overexpress E2F1, oncogenic E2F1 target genes, such as growth receptors (EGFR, androgen receptor), polycomb group proteins (EZH2), and nuclear
cofactors (CoF), are highly upregulated. This upregulation leads to the activation of cytoplasmic (PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK/ERK) and nuclear signaling
cascades related to invasion and metastasis. By activating cofactors, E2F1 constitutes feedback loops, which promote its prometastatic function. The same
pathways abrogate its apoptotic function. Under these conditions, chemotherapy enforces expression of oncogenes, such as mutant p53 (mtp53), and
thereby favors resistance toward apoptosis. The antiapoptotic response is supported by the loss of E2F1 cofactors required for proper activation of
death genes.

invasion and metastasis across a range of cancers (19) and is,
consistent with its oncogenic activity in cooperation with
E2F1, expressed at the highest levels in several metastatic
cancers. Besides cofactors that function as positive regulators of E2F1, receptor-interacting protein of 140 kDa
(RIP140) seems to be a ﬁrst example that such proteins are
also critical for repression of metastatic behavior (20).
RIP140 binds to the RB interaction domain of the E2F1
protein, thereby mimicking RB function. Corresponding with
the activity of E2F1 in aggressive cancers, low levels of
RIP140 are associated with high levels of E2F1 target genes
in basal-like breast tumors that frequently metastasize and
exhibit high mortality rates, whereas RIP140 expression is
high in the luminal subtype.
From this body of knowledge, E2F1 and its cofactors, independent of whether they are activators or repressors, have
entered the spotlight as drug targets. Selective interference with

E2F1 or ANCCA has been shown to prevent metastasis (10) or
tumor growth (14, 21). Therefore, it is reasonable to search for
small-molecule inhibitors that disrupt the binding of E2F1 to
promoters or the interactions between E2F1 and cofactors.

Metastasis Suppressor MicroRNAs Target E2F1
To date, it is not clear how E2F1 itself is upregulated in
metastatic cancer cells. Here, the latest evidence points
toward a contribution of microRNAs. Mir-205 was identiﬁed
as the microRNA with the highest degree of downregulation
in melanoma metastases, and it prevents tumor progression
via direct inhibition of E2F1 expression (22). The small
noncoding microRNA let-7g is known to counteract cancer
cell migration and is clearly downregulated in metastases
from hepatocellular carcinoma patients (23). This candidate
metastasis suppressor was shown to inhibit E2F1-dependent

cell migration via targeting the E2F1 activator HMGA2 (24).
These studies clearly emphasize that E2F1 is at the frontier
of tumor progression targeted by microRNAs opposing
metastasis.

E2F1 Mediates Chemoresistance
As cancers of advanced stage are commonly resistant
against DNA-damaging agents, E2F1 links metastasis to chemoresistance. Indeed, indications are clear that drug-resistant
tumor cells display an upregulation of the oncogenic E2F1signaling network, which mediates therapy evasion (25).
Microcephalin 1 (MCPH1) cooperates with E2F1 to induce
genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis upon chemotherapy in normal and tumor cells through complex formation on
the promoters of these genes (26). Considering the potential
impact of cofactors on E2F1's transcriptional activity, it is
intriguing that decreased levels of MCPH1 are associated with
genomic instability and metastasis (26). In addition, EZH2,
shown to antagonize expression of the E2F1 proapoptotic
target BIM and to drive metastasis (27), abrogates the DNA
damage response (28). Because EZH2 is induced by E2F1 as
well as genotoxic stress, it is reasonable, if not logical, to
assume that anticancer drugs can even potentiate apoptosis
evasion and cancer metastasis. This assumption also becomes
apparent from a recent article by Bug and Dobbelstein (29).
The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in about half of all
human malignancies and accumulates to levels that by far
exceed those of wild-type p53. The consequences of mutant
p53 accumulation include increased chemoresistance and
enhanced ability to metastasize (30). In this context, it seems

interesting that E2F1 binds the TP53 promoter and is necessary
for efﬁcient induction of mutant p53 upon drug treatment
in vitro (29). The ﬁndings are in line with a cell contextdependent synergism between E2F1 and DNA-damaging
agents in the upregulation of genes that are related to cell
survival and tumor progression (3, 31).

Future Perspectives
Together, the research implies that current therapies based
on the enforcement of apoptosis may not be suitable for the
eradication of aggressive cancer cells. In a cellular context in
which E2F1's prometastatic signaling becomes predominant,
conventional anticancer drug therapy will possibly render
adverse effects by supporting cancer progression (Fig. 1).
Consequently, full knowledge of the molecular mechanisms
underlying E2F1-induced tumor progression in an individual
cancer context is vital to avoid therapy failure and to improve
antimetastatic treatment.
