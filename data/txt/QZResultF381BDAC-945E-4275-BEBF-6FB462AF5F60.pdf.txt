Abstract
Angiogenesis is an important therapeutic target in cancer, and
to fully exploit its therapeutic potential, combination chemotherapeutic/antiangiogenic regimens should be optimized and
delivered earlier to more patients. Ideally, this could be
done by a single potent oral agent with established safety.
Rifampicin, a semisynthetic antibiotic derived from the
rifamycins, is one of the most commonly used pharmaceutical
compounds worldwide in the treatment of tuberculosis. Here,
we present the effects of oral rifampicin on human cancer
progression and its antiangiogenic properties, which were
comparable to the angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin. Clinically, low-dose p.o. administration of rifampicin to six highrisk patients with hepatitis C virus–related liver cirrhosis
resulted in a single occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma
during the follow-up period of 97.3 F 29.1 (mean F SD)
months. Experimentally, rifampicin rapidly and markedly
down-regulated the expression of a wide spectrum of
angiogenesis-associated genes in growing human microvascular endothelial cells, thereby suppressing endothelial cell
proliferation and migration. Rifampicin, at higher concentrations, also directly inhibited the growth of a variety of
human cancer cells. P.o. administration of rifampicin significantly inhibited in vivo growth and metastases of subcutaneous human cancer xenografts. Thus, the potent antiangiogenic
properties of oral rifampicin therapy were effective in
suppressing cancer progression. It provides a promising new
addition to antiangiogenic strategies for designing human
cancer therapies. Considering the clinical pharmacokinetics of
rifampicin, which enters the enterohepatic circulation and
undergoes subsequent hepatic accumulation, it may be
especially beneficial as an antitumor agent targeting hepatobiliary tumors. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4760–8]

Materials and Methods

Introduction
Cancer progression and metastasis depend on recruitment of
new capillaries from preexisting vessels, a process known as
angiogenesis (1). Because tumors that are unable to elicit
angiogenesis remain in a dormant state and fail to grow beyond
a few millimeters in size (2), the multistep process of
angiogenesis has fostered an intense search for agents that
might inhibit this process (3). Although tumor growth can be
stunted by a variety of single angiogenesis inhibitors (2),

combination antiangiogenesis protocols can be more effective
than single-agent therapies (3, 4). Furthermore, the combination
of traditional chemotherapy with antiangiogenesis agents, which
targets the endothelial cells of the growing tumor vasculature, as
well as the growing tumor cells themselves, has been shown to
minimize the resistance and adverse effects of chemotherapeutic
agents (4). However, successful clinical application of angiogenesis inhibitors, irrespective of monotherapy or combination
therapy, requires long-term administration, but most of these
entering clinical trials are costly, large molecular weight proteins
requiring parenteral administration (3, 5).
Rifampicin is a semisynthetic antibiotic derived from the
rifamycins, the common structure of which is a naphthohydroquinone or naphthoquinone chromophore spanned by an aliphatic
chain. Rifampicin binds to and activates pregnane X receptor,
which affects cytochrome P450, glucuronosyltransferases, and
p-glycoprotein activities (6). It is extensively used to treat
tuberculosis and for controlling pruritus in patients with chronic
cholestatic liver disease (7). Our encounter with a patient with
pulmonary tuberculosis combined with multiple hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCC), who seemed to show blunted tumor progression while receiving rifampicin, prompted us to study whether oral
rifampicin had a significant tumor-suppressive effect. Our data
revealed involvement of both antiangiogenic properties and a
direct tumor cell inhibitory effect of rifampicin in suppressing
human cancer progression, and, considering its clinical pharmacokinetics, oral rifampicin may be especially beneficial in targeting
hepatobiliary tumors. Furthermore, we found that rifampicin exerts
its antiangiogenic effect through inhibition of the expression of
angiogenesis-associated genes in a manner comparable to the
action of endostatin, an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor known
to down-regulate a variety of growth- and angiogenesis-related
genes in a wide range of endothelial lineage cells (8, 9).

Clinical follow-up. Six patients were followed up monthly at Tokyo
Medical and Dental University Hospital, after a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis
by either liver biopsy and/or a combination of clinical features. During
monthly visits, they underwent physical examination, urinalysis, and
complete blood count, with measurement of serum a-fetoprotein,
prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and serum
chemistry. All patients received a liver ultrasound, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and/or computed tomography (CT) at least every 6 mo. The
protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Tokyo Medical and
Dental University.
In vivo human cancer xenograft experiments. CW-2 human colon
cancer xenograft experiments were conducted in accordance with the
Guidelines for Animal Experimentation, and approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Male
athymic BALB/c Slc-nu mice (Japan SLC) were given free access to
sterile rodent chow and water. CW-2 cells (1.2  106 per animal) were
implanted s.c. in the hind flank region in 8-wk-old mice. When tumors

had reached 200 mm3, animals were moved to a cage supplied with
sterile drinking water containing either 0.2 mg/mL rifampicin/0.25%
DMSO or 0.25% DMSO alone. Tumor growth during the treatment period
was monitored by measuring the tumor mass on the animals using
vernier calipers thrice a week. Tumor volume was calculated as the
product of length  (width)2  0.52. The well-established Lewis lung
carcinoma xenograft experiment was done by Shibayagi, Inc. LL/2 cells
(106 per animal) were s.c. injected into the flank of 8-wk-old male
athymic BALB/c AnNCrj-nu/nu mice (Japan Charles Liver). Animals were
started on 0.8 mg rifampicin, 3-formyl rifamycin SV, rifamycin SV, or
double-distilled water (ddH2O) via a gastric tube once daily during
weekdays when the tumor volume had reached 200 mm3. The tumor
volume was calculated thrice a week as described above. Each group
contained seven mice. On termination of the efficacy portion of the
experiment, animals were euthanized; liver and lungs were excised,
sectioned, and photographed; and the ratio of metastatic to total section
area was calculated. Tumor volume and metastasis data of treated
groups were compared with those of the control group using Wilcoxon’s
rank sum test.
In vivo transsplenic liver metastasis model. The growth of the A549
human lung cancer cells metastasized into liver was evaluated by
Panapharm Laboratories, essentially as described previously (10). In brief,
1.5  106 cells in 0.05 mL PBS were injected into the medial splenic tip of
the anesthetized BALB/cA Jcl-nu nu/nu mice (Japan Crea Laboratory)
through a left lateral flank incision. No significant bleeding or extravasation
was encountered. After 10 min, the spleen was removed to avoid
intrasplenic tumor growth. Four days after injection, the treated mice were
divided into four groups and were started on 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg/d
rifampicin or 30 mg/kg/d 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) via a gastric tube once daily
during weekdays. Rifampicin was dissolved to 0, 5, or 10 mg/mL using 0.5%
carboxymethylcellulose sodium solution, and 10 mL/kg/d was administered
at 10 a.m. after a 2-h fast. After 3 wk, the animals were anesthetized; blood
was withdrawn for the measurement of CA15-3; and the animals were
sacrificed to examine macroscopic metastasis as well as micrometastasis
after fixation.
Mouse dorsal air sac assay. Malignant tumor cell–induced angiogenesis
was assessed by Panapharm Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan) as described
(11). A Millipore chamber prepared by covering both sides with Millipore
filters (0.45-mm pore size) was filled with 5  106 Sarcoma 180 cells
suspended in 0.15 mL PBS. The tumor cell–containing chamber was

www.aacrjournals.org

implanted into a subcutaneous dorsal air sac formed in a 9- or 10-wk-old
female Crlj:CD1 (ICR) mouse by injecting f8 mL of air. Each group of mice
treated with tumor cells was given via a gastric tube with 0, 100, or 200 mg/
kg/d rifampicin once a day or with 200 mg/kg/d silibinin twice daily as a
positive control for 5 d. Rifampicin was dissolved to 10 or 20 mg/mL using
0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium and silibinin to 10 mg/mL (0.9% NaCl,
3% ethanol, 1% Tween 80, and 6.6 mmol/L NaOH). The nontumor control
group, which received chambers containing PBS in place of Sarcoma 180
cells, was given the vehicle alone. On day 5, the implanted chambers were
removed from the subcutaneous fascia of the treated animals, and then a
black ring (Sanko Kagaku, Hiroshima) with the same inner diameter as the
Millipore ring was inserted at the same site. The angiogenic response was
assessed under a dissecting microscope by counting newly formed blood
vessels >3 mm in length within the area encircled by the black ring. The
neovessels were morphologically distinguishable from the preexisting
background vessels by their tortuous nature.
Cell culture. Rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (rPEC) and rat
aortic endothelial cells (rAEC) prepared from the pulmonary artery and
aorta of male Wistar rats, respectively, and diploid rat fibroblasts have been
described previously (9, 12, 13). Human dermal microvascular endothelial
cells (hMVEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (hUVEC) were
purchased from Kurabo and Sanko-Junyaku, and human retinal endothelial
cells (hREC) from Cell Systems Corporation. Human colon carcinoma cells,
CW-2, human gastric cancer cells, MKN-1, and human liver cancer cells,
HepG2, were purchased from RIKEN BioResource Center Cell Bank.
Endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis assays.
Anchorage-dependent cell migration was assessed using the monolayerdenuding protocol as described previously (14). Confluent cultures of
endothelial cells in collagen-coated dishes were pretreated with or without
rifampicin for 16 h, and then denuded with a surgical blade. Cells were
further incubated in 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with
growth factors, whereas phase-contrast photomicroscopy was done at the
indicated times at four distinct sites, and the cell migration rate was
measured. DNA synthesis in confluent cultures was negligible during the
monolayer wounding experiments, and repopulation within 24 h was
almost entirely to the result of cell migration (9). Exponentially proliferating
cells plated in 24-well plates were incubated for 24, 48, or 72 h in the
presence or absence of indicated concentrations of rifampicin, rifamycin SV,
or 3-formyl rifamycin SV. Cells were then released from culture plates by
trypsinization, and cell numbers counted using a Sysmex CDA-500

Autoanalyzer (Toa Medical Electronics) as described previously (9, 15, 16).
Proapoptotic effects were evaluated by adding rifampicin to growing cell
cultures and determining caspase-3 levels as described previously (17).
Evaluation of antitumor activity using a human cancer cell line
panel coupled with a drug sensitivity database. A human cancer cell line
panel, composed of 39 cell lines combined with a database for evaluating
the cell growth inhibition profile, originally established according to the
method of the National Cancer Institute (18, 19), was done by Takao Yamori
(Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research),
as previously described (20, 21). Antitumor activity was assessed by changes
in total cellular protein after 48-h rifampicin treatment using a sulforhodamine B assay (20, 22).
Gene inhibition profile determined by real-time quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR. Exponentially growing hMVECs or hUVECs
supplemented with FBS and growth factors in 6-cm dishes (106 cells) were
treated with the indicated concentrations of rifampicin, rifamycin SV, and 3formyl rifamycin SV for the indicated time. Total RNA was extracted using
QIAzol (Qiagen), and 1 Ag of RNA was reverse transcribed with the firststrand cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen). The expression of angiogenesisassociated genes was quantified by a LightCycler (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals)-based, real-time, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) protocol using Syber Green as described (9, 23). Quantification
of c-myc, integrin-av, ID1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and
hepatocyte growth factor was done by TaqMan fluorescence methods using
a Universal Probe Library (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Chromo 4
Four-Color Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The
fluorescence data were quantitatively analyzed by using serial dilution of
control samples included in each reaction to produce a standard curve.
We have also quantified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and
h-actin mRNA levels to confirm technical validity.

Results
Clinical benefit of low-dose, long-term oral rifampicin in six
patients with hepatitis C virus–related liver cirrhosis. Since
1994, six patients (one male and five females, 58.2 F 3.8 years at
initial visit), confirmed to have HCV-related liver cirrhosis,
volunteered to receive low-dose oral rifampicin therapy (Table 1).
They were at high risk for the development of HCC (24); therefore,
they received monthly follow-up by a hepatologist (Y.T.) and 4- to
6-monthly examinations using liver ultrasound, MRI, and/or CT. All
six patients had HCV genotype Ib with high HCV RNA levels (110–
20,000 kIU/mL), suggesting resistance to IFN-a therapy (25).
Patient 1 received IFN-a treatment in 1991 and 1992 without a
virological or sustained biochemical response. He had mitral
regurgitation as a result of ruptured chordae tendineae but did not
receive cardiac surgery because of liver cirrhosis. He developed
HCC in the S4 portion in May 1993 and another in the S8 portion in
November 1993, both of which were treated with transarterial
embolization with associated chemotherapy. His serum a-fetoprotein, a commonly used tumor marker for HCC, started to increase,
reaching 66 ng/mL in May 1994. He started treatment with
rifampicin 300 mg daily, and within 4 months, his a-fetoprotein
was reduced to 15 ng/mL. Because this decrease of a-fetoprotein
did not necessarily indicate that rifampicin caused regression of
undetectably small HCC, his physician (Y.T.) hesitated to let him
continue with the antibiotic. They agreed to discontinue rifampicin
in September 1995 when liver ultrasonography did not detect any
abnormal mass. Three months later, however, HCC of f2.5-cm

diameter developed in the S8 portion, which was treated with
transarterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection.
Since then, he had just had rifampicin therapy, initially 300 mg and,
after September 1996, 150 mg daily. A mass of 1.5-cm diameter was
detected on the liver surface S4 area by MRI in July 1999, for which
he received open liver biopsy followed by local microwave ablation
in October 1999. Resected liver specimens were histologically
negative for HCC. Despite the very high expected recurrence rate
(26) and frequent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, he was
totally free from HCC until he died suddenly in January 2002
(Fig. 1A). Patient 2 has been followed since July 1992. Her afetoprotein level was normal until May 1998 when it started to
increase sharply. She was prescribed oral rifampicin, 150 mg daily,
in October 1998, but her a-fetoprotein continued to increase,
reaching a peak value of 113 ng/mL in August 1999. This increase
led her physician (Y.T.) to increase the rifampicin dose to 300 mg
daily, which reduced her a-fetoprotein level to 26.4 ng/mL in
March 2000. Her a-fetoprotein never showed a substantial increase
thereafter, even after rifampicin was decreased to 150 mg daily

(Fig. 1B). Patient 3 was referred to Y.T. in February 1998. IFN-a
therapy reduced her a-fetoprotein but was discontinued because of
adverse reactions. In August 1999, her a-fetoprotein increased to
129.2 ng/mL and she was started on rifampicin 150 mg daily, which
reduced her a-fetoprotein level thereafter (Fig. 1C). Patients 4 to 6
started oral rifampicin 150 mg daily in the slim hope that it might
retard the development of HCC. Patients 5 and 6 received IFN-a
before commencing rifampicin therapy, but soon discontinued
because of adverse effects. In June 2006, 10 years after the start of
rifampicin, patient 5 showed clear-cut evidence of HCCs in the S1
and S8 portions, which were treated with transarterial embolization
followed by percutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation.
Surprisingly, as of March 2008, this is the only HCC that developed
in the six patients during the entire rifampicin therapy period of
97.3 F 29.1 (mean F SD) months. Rifampicin induced neither an
adverse reaction nor HCV RNA negativity.

high-risk liver cirrhosis patients, we first studied the effect of oral
rifampicin on cancer progression in well-established mouse
xenograft models implanted s.c. with human colon cancer (CW-2)
cells. BALB/c Slc-nu mice receiving rifampicin in their drinking
water ingested 0.68 F 0.01 mg rifampicin/d (34.0 F 0.9 mg/kg/d)
and showed a significantly reduced rate of tumor growth compared
with those receiving control 0.25% DMSO/ddH2O (Fig. 2A). Mice
receiving rifampicin for 4 weeks showed a mean tumor growth
volume 48% less than the control group (P < 0.05). We next
implanted Lewis lung carcinoma (LL/2) cells subcutaneously in
BALB/c AnNCrj-nu/nu mice (27). The mice that were orally given
either rifampicin, rifamycin SV, or 3-formyl rifamycin SV via a
gastric tube (40 mg/kg/d) showed a significantly slower tumor
growth rate (P < 0.05f0.01; Fig. 2B) and reduced metastatic areas
in the liver and lung in comparison with those receiving control
0.25% DMSO/ddH2O (P < 0.05f0.01; Fig. 2C and D). We next
injected a human non–small cell lung cancer cell line (A549) into
the spleen of BALB/cA Jcl-nu nu/nu mice and, 4 days after
inoculation, started giving rifampicin via a gastric tube for 3 weeks.
Oral rifampicin reduced the degree of metastasis in hepatic
sections as observed photomicroscopically (data not shown) and
dose-dependently inhibited the increase in serum CA15-3 concentration, a specific tumor marker produced by metastasized A549
cells (Fig. 3), indicating reduced growth of the hepatic metastatic
tumor. The effect of oral rifampicin was comparable to or exceeded
that of 30 mg/kg/d 5-FU. These results showed that oral rifampicin
potently suppresses the growth of both inoculated and metastasized cancer independently of mouse strain and tumor origin, and
that two rifamycins also have a comparable suppressive effect on
tumor progression.
In vivo antiangiogenic effect of oral rifampicin. Sarcoma 180
cells induced a robust angiogenic response in the otherwise poorly
vascularized subcutaneous area when inserted in a Millipore
diffusion chamber and implanted in a dorsal air sac of Crlj:CD1
mice (28). Rifampicin (100 or 200 mg/kg/d) was given p.o. via a
gastric tube once daily for 5 days starting after implantation of the
Millipore chamber and was compared with those receiving silibinin
(200 mg/kg/d), a potent angiogenesis inhibitor (29). Control
animals were implanted with a Millipore chamber with or without
Sarcoma 180 cells and received ddH2O. At the end of the treatment,
animals were sacrificed, the chambers removed, and vascularization in the skin in contact with the chamber was observed
microscopically. Oral rifampicin dose-dependently inhibited newly
formed blood microvessels without inducing any toxic effects
(Fig. 4). Administration of 200 mg/kg/d oral rifampicin resulted in
a 63.5% decrease in the number of neovessels (P < 0.0001) and
exceeded the effect of silibinin. To highlight the involvement of
angiogenesis in in vivo rifampicin-induced tumor suppression, its
direct antitumor effect was also assessed. CDF1 mice were
inoculated i.p. with 106 lymphocytic lymphoma cells (P388), and
100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/d rifampicin was administered i.p. on days 1
and 5. Rifampicin did not reduce the median survival of P388inoculated mice, suggesting no antitumor effect in a model where
angiogenesis is not involved. Taken together, the direct antitumor
effect of rifampicin can hardly explain the significant inhibition of
xenograft tumor progression in immunodeficient mice, but its
antiangiogenic effect can reasonably account for this inhibition.
Effects of rifampicin on cell proliferation, migration, and
apoptosis. To determine whether rifampicin and rifamycins
induce in vitro antiangiogenic activities, we tested the antiproliferative activity of rifampicin and rifamycins in vascular endothelial

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

cells. Rifampicin suppressed FBS-stimulated proliferation of
exponentially growing hMVECs (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and
hRECs (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The effects were concentration
and time dependent and also observed to a lesser degree in rPECs
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). 3-Formyl rifamycin SV also exerted an
antiproliferative effect on hMVECs, hRECs, and rPECs (Supplementary Fig. S1D–F). However, rifamycin SV showed significant
cytotoxic effects on the three types of endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig. S1G–I). The inhibitory effects of rifampicin on VEGFinduced proliferation in quiescent hUVECs were also concentration
dependent (25–100 Ag/mL), but not as potent as in growing
endothelial cells (IC50 f60 Ag/mL).
We determined the antiproliferative effect of rifampicin on
human cancer-derived cells and compared their effects with
endothelial cells. Rifampicin suppressed the proliferation of CW-2
and HepG2, but the effects were less potent than on endothelial
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). To evaluate the antiproliferative
activity of rifampicin on human cancer-derived cells, a panel of 39
human cancer cell lines combined with a database was used (20).
This panel was made up of five breast cancer, six glioma, five
colorectal cancer, seven lung cancer, one melanoma, five ovarian
cancer, two renal cancer, six gastric cancer, and prostate cancer cell
lines. Rifampicin at 10 4 mol/L (82 Ag/mL) significantly inhibited
the growth of the cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
sensitivity of each type of cancer cell to rifampicin, as assessed
by the concentration required for 50% growth inhibition (GI50),
was higher than 4.8  10 5 mol/L; the average GI50 value was

metastasis was evaluated by measuring the plasma level of CA15-3, a
specific tumor marker produced by A549. Columns, mean for eight mice;

Figure 4. Inhibitory effect of rifampicin on angiogenic response by human
sarcoma. Sarcoma 180 cells (A431) were implanted into the mouse dorsal air
sac and the indicated doses of rifampicin or silibinin were given via a gastric tube
for 5 d. A, tumor-induced angiogenesis in the skin was evaluated by counting
the number of neovessels microscopically. Columns, mean for eight mice; bars,

rifampicin on A431 cell–induced angiogenesis. The area circled with a black ring
corresponds to the exact portion of the air sac fascia in contact with a Millipore
chamber containing A431 cells. In comparison with nontumor control (i),
the air sac fascia of a control mouse was densely capillarized (ii ), but very

f10 4 mol/L. Therefore, rifampicin directly suppressed the growth
of cancer cells, but the concentrations required for anticancer cell
proliferation were higher than those to inhibit endothelial cells.
Rifampicin and 3-formyl rifamycin SV concentration-dependently (0–40 Ag/mL) suppressed the progression rate of the denuded
edge of monolayer hMVECs, suggesting a migration inhibitory
effect (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). They also inhibited the

www.aacrjournals.org

migration of hRECs (Supplementary Fig. S4C). However, rifampicin
did not acutely block VEGF-induced migration of hUVECs detected
by the Boyden chamber method. We next determined whether
rifampicin has significant proapoptotic activity. Rifampicin 10 to
40 Ag/mL did not induce apoptosis in rPECs, rAECs, hMVECs,
hRECs, or human cancer cells (CW-2, MKN-1, HepG2, U937) when
cultured under serum-supplemented conditions. The results
showed that rifampicin inhibits anchorage-dependent endothelial
cell migration without inducing any appreciable proapoptotic
activity in serum-supplemented conditions. Although these features are characteristic of endostatin, the effects of 40 Ag/mL
rifampicin on endothelial proliferation seem to be more potent
than 10 6 mol/L endostatin (8).
We explored whether rifampicin possesses other features
characteristic of antiangiogenesis and anticancer reagents. We
measured cell-surface ATP synthase activity by quantifying the
nucleotides generated in culture media using the CellTiterGlo
luminescence assay (30) because potent angiogenesis inhibitors,
such as angiostatin, reduce ATP production by binding to the cellsurface ATP synthase h-subunit (31). Rifampicin (10–40 Ag/mL) did
not suppress ATP production of rAECs incubated at 17% CO2 and 5%
CO2, suggesting no effect on ATP synthase activity. The inhibitory
effect of rifampicin on histone deacetylase-1 enzymatic activity was
measured by quantifying 7-amino-4-methyl coumarine after addition
of an acetylated fluorescent peptide to recombinant human histone
deacetylase 1 as a substrate. Rifampicin suppressed histone
deacetylase-1 activity only at very high concentrations (IC50 375
Ag/mL), showing its negligible effect. Rifampicin (0.1–100 Ag/mL) did
not suppress the infiltration of cultured HT1080 human fibrous
sarcoma cells in a Matrigel-based invasion assay (32). Rifampicin at
10 5 mol/L (8.2 Ag/mL) did not modify nerve growth factor–induced
neurite outgrowth of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, the phenotype
associated with colchicine- and Taxol-induced microtubule assembly. Rifampicin (1–100 Ag/mL) did not affect the activities of protein
kinase A, protein kinase C, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase,
or VEGF receptor (Flt-1) kinase (33), whereas it caused 50% to 80%
suppression of protein tyrosine kinase, calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase III (34), only at 100 Ag/mL. Taken together, these
results reveal that rifampicin shows some features characteristic of
other anticancer reagents but only at high concentrations in the
hepatobiliary system.
Down-regulation of angiogenesis-associated genes by
rifampicin. We next determined whether rifampicin rapidly
down-regulated a variety of growth-, migration-, and angiogenesis-associated genes in the endothelium because this phenomenon
is induced by a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, endostatin (8, 9).
Using a real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we quantified the mRNA
levels of angiogenic factors (VEGF and hepatocyte growth factor),
ID1, VEGF receptors (KDR and Flt-1), platelet/endothelial cell
adhesion molecule 1, focal adhesion kinase, endothelin 1,
endothelin receptor type B, integrin-av, integrin-h3, and c-myc in
hMVECs. Rifampicin rapidly down-regulated all of these genes in
a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A); within 4 hours of
rifampicin treatment, mRNA levels of each gene treated with
40 Ag/mL rifampicin decreased to levels comparable to those in
cells deprived of serum and growth supplements for 4 hours. The
ability of rifampicin to down-regulate gene expression is either
absent or far less in nonendothelial cells, such as rat fibroblasts and
human cancer cell lines (HepG2, MKN-1, and CW-2). Rifamycin SV
and 3-formyl rifamycin SV also reduced the mRNA levels of many
genes, including integrin-av, integrin-h3, and c-myc (Fig. 5B); the

spectrum of suppression was almost identical to that of rifampicin.
Similar results were obtained with rPECs, rAECs, and hUVECs.
These results showed that rifampicin and two rifamycins potently
down-regulate proangiogenic gene expression in a variety of
endothelial cells, comparable to the effects of endostatin (8).

Discussion
HCV-related liver cirrhosis is a major risk factor for development
of HCC, with an annual incidence reaching 7.9% in an untreated,
biopsy-proven population (24, 35). Even after initial treatment,
second HCCs develop at new foci in f30% of patients within the
first year, leading to a poor prognosis (26). IFN treatment can
inhibit HCC in patients with moderate liver fibrosis, but only
marginally in liver cirrhosis (35–37). Although the present clinical
observation is restricted to only six patients, it should be
emphasized that only a single HCC developed during the entire
rifampicin therapy period of 97.3 F 29.1 months despite many
features indicating a high risk for HCC (24). First, none had any
apparent benefit from IFN therapy; two did not receive IFN; four

never achieved sustained HCV negativity; and three patients
discontinued IFN due to adverse reactions. Second, they were
relatively old, at 62.0 F 5.2 years, at the start of rifampicin therapy.
Third, they had high serum alanine aminotransferase levels before
rifampicin therapy (38). Fourth, patients 1 to 3 showed increasing
a-fetoprotein levels when rifampicin was started (39). Patient 1,
who had the highest risk for HCC because of relapsing episodes,
developed HCC shortly after discontinuation of rifampicin in 1995,
but HCC never recurred after restarting rifampicin. Because afetoprotein can either be produced by HCC itself or by regenerating
hepatic tissues after significant hepatic injury, its marked decrease
suggests either reduction of HCC, undetectable by ultrasound or
MRI, or suppression of hepatic injury and subsequent regeneration.
Whatever the mechanisms, large-scale prospective trials should be
done to establish the overall clinical usefulness of low-dose oral
rifampicin therapy.
To gain insight into the mechanism behind the clinical benefit of
low-dose, long-term rifampicin therapy, we tested its effects on
cultured endothelial and nonendothelial cells. Rifampicin and two
rifamycins similarly suppressed a variety of mitogenesis- and

levels were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Columns, mean percentage of the level in untreated cells from four repeated experiments; bars, SE.

Rifampicin as an Oral Angiogenesis Inhibitor

angiogenesis-related genes (40) in both human and rat endothelial
cells; the time course and potency, as well as the spectrum of gene
suppression, are comparable to those previously observed with
endostatin (9). There is general agreement that endostatin inhibits
cultured endothelial cell migration, but it is less clear whether
endostatin also affects endothelial cell apoptosis and proliferation
(2, 9, 41–46). In our in vitro study using the same protocol as
our previous endostatin study (9), the antiproliferative effects of
40 Ag/mL rifampicin and 3-formyl rifamycin SV on microvascular
endothelial cells were clearly greater than those seen with the
treatment dose of endostatin. An antimigratory effect was also
evident, but this was not as marked as the antiproliferative effect.
These results show the antiangiogenic properties of rifampicin and
3-formyl rifamycin SV and the potential utility of oral rifampicin as
an angiogenesis inhibitor. Considering that its inhibition of
endothelial cell proliferation is more potent than that of endostatin, rifampicin could even be used in combination with
endostatin, not to mention with other types of angiogenesis
inhibitor, or with chemotherapeutic agents. Rifampicin also
showed direct growth inhibition of a variety of cancer cells, but
only at high concentrations corresponding to bile and urine levels
after oral ingestion. The cell growth inhibition profile (20, 22) was
similar to that of IFN-a, TZT-1027, and vincristine. These results
show that, although rifampicin and 3-formyl rifamycin SV markedly
inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells, the growth-inhibiting
effects of rifampicin on cancer cells are less marked, suggesting
that rifampicin has a more potent effect through antiangiogenesis
rather than a direct cancer-suppressive effect.
For in vivo experiments, we used well-established xenograft
tumor models in mice to test the effectiveness of rifampicin as an
inhibitor of angiogenesis-dependent tumor growth. The growth of
CW-2 colon primary tumors was significantly suppressed by oral
rifampicin. When rifampicin or rifamycins were administered to
Lewis lung carcinoma xenograft mice, lung and liver metastases, as
well as tumor growth, were inhibited to a similar extent. Although
the doses of rifampicin and rifamycins used in animal studies were
>10-fold higher than the doses given to patients, the estimated
plasma levels in these animals must be far lower than those
showing inhibitory effects on cancer cells. Furthermore, we also
performed the mouse dorsal air sac assay, which is well
documented to represent tumor-induced angiogenesis and its
inhibition in mouse xenografts (47, 48). Thus, significant inhibition
of xenograft tumor progression in immunodeficient mice can
barely be explained by the direct antitumor effect of rifampicin, but
can reasonably be accounted for by its antiangiogenic effect.
Despite the potential use of oral rifampicin as a general
angiogenesis inhibitor, its biliary excretion and enterohepatic
circulation may be especially beneficial in accumulating this agent
and its metabolites in the hepatobiliary system. Biliary and hepatic
concentrations of rifampicin and its metabolites are known to be
far higher and more sustained than plasma levels after p.o.

administration (49). Peak plasma rifampicin after single oral doses
of 150 and 300 mg are as high as 2 and 3.5 Ag/mL, respectively, in
normal subjects, whereas hepatic bile and urine levels easily exceed
100 Ag/mL (49). Even at 12 hours after an oral dose of 150 mg,
hepatic bile concentrations of rifampicin and its metabolite still
remain at 100 Ag/mL in normal subjects. In liver cirrhosis, serum
and biliary levels are further elevated and mean half-life is
prolonged because its bile excretion reaches saturation, resulting
in very constant, high levels (50). Such clinical pharmacokinetics of
rifampicin explain the remarkable effect of low-dose, once daily,
oral rifampicin on suppressing HCC in liver cirrhosis and provide a
reasonable rationale for its use as an antiangiogenic agent targeting
the hepatobiliary system. Moreover, our results show that, at
concentrations >100 Ag/mL, rifampicin could exert its direct
growth-inhibitory effects on tumor cells, in addition to its
antiangiogenic activity, thus allowing an efficient combination of
chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy by a single oral agent.
In summary, we have shown the effectiveness of oral rifampicin
in both clinical and experimental settings. Low-dose, long-term
oral rifampicin inhibited the development of HCC in HCV-related
liver cirrhosis patients, whereas a comparatively larger dose of oral
rifampicin significantly suppressed the growth and metastases of
human cancer xenografts in mouse models. In addition, rifampicin
exerted antiangiogenic properties. These include down-regulation
of proangiogenic genes and inhibition of microvascular endothelial
cell proliferation. Rifampicin at higher doses showed direct growth
inhibition of cancer cells. Considering its clinical pharmacokinetic
profile, oral rifampicin could exert its direct tumor-suppressive
effect in the hepatobiliary system and, together with its potent
antiangiogenic properties, may be especially beneficial in targeting
hepatobiliary tumors.
