Abstract
Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) counteracts the
physiological epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
process that is indicative of epithelial plasticity. Because EMT is
involved in cancer, we investigated whether BMP7 plays a role
in breast cancer growth and metastasis. In this study, we show
that decreased BMP7 expression in primary breast cancer is
significantly associated with the formation of clinically overt
bone metastases in patients with z10 years of follow-up. In line
with these clinical observations, BMP7 expression is inversely
related to tumorigenicity and invasive behavior of human
breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, BMP7 decreased the
expression of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker associated with
invasiveness and poor prognosis, in human MDA-MB-231
(MDA-231)-B/Luc+ breast cancer cells under basal and transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B)–stimulated conditions. In
addition, exogenous addition of BMP7 to TGF-B–stimulated
MDA-231 cells inhibited Smad-mediated TGF-B signaling.
Furthermore, in a well-established bone metastasis model using
whole-body bioluminescent reporter imaging, stable overexpression of BMP7 in MDA-231 cells inhibited de novo formation and progression of osteolytic bone metastases and, hence,
their metastatic capability. In line with these observations,
daily i.v. administration of BMP7 (100 Mg/kg/d) significantly
inhibited orthotopic and intrabone growth of MDA-231-B/Luc+
cells in nude mice. Our data suggest that decreased BMP7
expression during carcinogenesis in the human breast contributes to the acquisition of a bone metastatic phenotype. Because
exogenous BMP7 can still counteract the breast cancer growth
at the primary site and in bone, BMP7 may represent a novel
therapeutic molecule for repression of local and bone metastatic growth of breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8742–51]

Approximately 90% of cancer deaths result from the local invasion

the process of metastasis is, therefore, urgently needed. Increased
motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells is reminiscent of
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that occurs
during embryonic development (2, 3). This transition to a more
mesenchymal, motile cellular phenotype is the result of a complex
physiologic process that includes dissolution of adherens junctions, loss of cell polarity, a change to spindle-like cell morphology,
cytoskeletal reorganization, increased cell motility, loss of epithelial markers, and induction of mesenchymal marker (2, 4).
Increased vimentin expression and perturbation of E-cadherin–
mediated cell adhesion appear as hallmarks of this process (4–8).
However, in organogenesis, ‘mesenchymal’ cells may possess
remarkable plasticity and can eventually regain a fully differentiated epithelial phenotype via a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET; refs. 9–11).
Members of the transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) superfamily, which include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), are
involved in the control of many different biological processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and regulation of invasiveness (12–14). In normal and nonmalignant epithelial
cells, TGF-h is a potent growth inhibitor (15, 16). However,
different types of carcinomas often escape this tumor-suppressing
activity and become refractile to growth inhibition (15, 16). Even
more, TGF-h can also potentiate tumorigenesis and contribute to
the progression and invasiveness of various carcinomas (8, 17, 18).
Accordingly, it has been shown that a blockade of TGF-h
(signaling) inhibits tumor cell viability, migration, and metastasis
(19), including the formation of bone metastases (20, 21).
The homodimeric protein BMP7 induces MET in normal and
nontransformed cells (14, 22). For instance, during kidney
development, BMP7 is essential for the condensation and
epithelialization of the metanephric mesenchyme in the kidney,
resulting in the formation of the tubular epithelium (9–11, 14).
Furthermore, BMP7 seems to be involved in the preservation of the
epithelial phenotype (23, 24), decreases fibrogenesis (23–25), and
causes repression of inflammation (26, 27).
In this study, we present a cross-talk between BMP7 and TGF-h
signaling in the regulation of EMT in breast cancer and identify
BMP7 as a potential therapy for metastatic bone disease.

Collection (ATCC)] were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 4.5 g
glucose/L for MDA-231 or RPMI 1640 (ATCC) for T47D and ZR-75-1,
supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen), 100 units/mL penicillin, and
50 Ag/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Culture medium for T47D was
supplemented with 6.5 Ag/mL insulin (Sigma Chemical Co.), and in culture
medium for MDA-231-B/Luc+, a bone-seeking and luciferase-expressing
subclone from MDA-231 (28), 800 Ag/mL geneticin/G418 (Invitrogen) was
added. MCF10A (29) and its fully malignant derivate MCF10CA1a (Barbara
Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI; ref. 30) were cultured as
described previously (30). All cell lines were grown in a humidified
incubator at 37jC and 5% CO2. Mycoplasma contamination was regularly
tested by PCR, but never detected.
Putative BMP7 effects on luciferase expression by MDA-231-B/Luc+ cells
have been tested and excluded (data not shown).
Generation of isogenic BMP7-overexpressing cell lines using
targeted integration. MDA-231 cells that display a unique predilection
for bone (MDA-231-BO2; ref. 31) were selected to generate a stable cell line
that overexpresses BMP7. Stable cell lines were generated using the Flp-In
system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (32). In short,
a MDA-231-BO2-Flp-in host cell line (MDA-231-BO2-Frt11) was generated
by stable introduction of a single copy of a Flp recombinase target (FRT)
site as an integral part of an antibiotic resistancy gene in the genome of
these cells. Subsequently, a luciferase-expressing subclone (MDA-231-BO2Frt11/Luc+) was generated as described previously (28). This clone was used
for the generation of isogenic stable cell lines by transient cotransfection of
an FRT-targeting vector and a Flp recombinase expression vector. The FRTtargeting vector was either a pcDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) expressing
green fluorescent protein (GFP; control) or BMP7 (target gene) under the
control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor. Due to Flp-mediated
recombination at the genomic FRT site, this targeting vector was
incorporated in the genome. Simultaneously, a shift in antibiotic resistance
was introduced allowing positive selection for integrants in the genomic
FRT site only and negative selection for random integrants in one single
step (32). This method allows the generation of isogenic stable cell lines,
which only differ in sequence inserted in the genomic FRT site, thereby
eliminating the need for clonal selection. It is important to note that both
the MDA-231-BO2-Frt11 and MDA-231-BO2-Frt11/Luc+ cell line were
validated for in vivo bone metastasis formation.
Patients. We retrospectively analyzed tumor tissue from 67 primary
unilateral nonmetastatic ductal breast carcinomas excised from women
treated at Centre René Huguenin (St. Cloud, France) from 1980 to 1994. The
samples were examined histologically for the presence of tumor cells. A
tumor sample was considered suitable if the proportion of tumor cells was
>70%. Immediately after surgery, the tumor samples were stored in liquid
nitrogen until RNA extraction.
Standard prognostic factors are presented in Supplementary Table S1. All
patients were treated by hormone therapy only after surgery. The patients
had physical examinations and routine chest radiography every 3 months
for the first 2 years, followed by annual examination (mammograms). The
median follow-up was 11.2 years (range, 1.5–20.3 years). Thirty-five patients
were without relapse (z10 years of follow-up), 17 patients developed
exclusively visceral metastases (liver and/or lung), and 15 patients
developed exclusively bone metastases. Immunohistochemical validation
was done on fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from primary breast
tumor specimens (8 of 67).
ELISA for human BMP7. Levels of BMP7 in conditioned medium were
measured with a commercially available specific ELISA kit using sandwich
enzyme immunoassay technique (R&D Systems). Cells were routinely
cultured for 4 days.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with
the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen) from in vitro cultured cells at 70% to 80%
confluence. Reverse transcription was done with random primers in the
presence of RNase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). Quantitative real-time
reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) was done using commercially obtained
exon-specific primers for BMP7, E-cadherin, vimentin, and h-actin (Applied
Biosystems) on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems). All experiments were done in duplo on four different samples.

For BMP7 mRNA detection in patients, qPCR (including thermal cycling
conditions) was done as described previously (33). Each sample was
normalized based on its TATA box-binding protein (TBP) content. Primers
used were as follows: BMP7 ATGGCCAACGTGGCAGAGAA ( forward) and
CAGCCCAGGTCTCGGAAGCT (reverse) and TBP TGCACAGGAGCCAAGAGTGAA ( forward) and CACATCACAGCTCCCCACCA (reverse). All qPCR
values were normalized using the comparative method of Livak and
Schmittgen (34).
Western blot. Cells were seeded in six-wells plates at a density of 20,000/
cm2 in DMEM with 0.1% Fetal Clone II (FCII; HyClone, Perbio Science
Nederland B.V.) for MDA-231-B/Luc+. After 18 h, cells were stimulated with
recombinant human mature BMP7 [rhBMP7; 0.5 mg batches; Creative
Biomolecules; rhBMP7 was freshly dissolved to a stock solution [1 mg/mL
in 20 mmol/L acetate buffer with 5% mannitol (pH 4.5)] and was obtained
from Dr. Vukicevic, Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Zagreb,
Croatia; ref. 35] and/or porcine TGF-h2 (R&D Systems). After an additional
48 h, cells were lysed and collected in 250 AL lysis buffer [20 nmol/L Tris
(pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 400 mmol/L KCl, 1 nmol/L DTT, aprotinin (1:1,000),
Roche protease inhibitor mix] followed by one or two rounds of freeze/
thawing and used for Western blot analysis as described earlier (36). Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies a-vimentin (diluted 1:500; ab7783, Abcam) and a-Ecadherin (diluted 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Tebu-bio), and a mouse
monoclonal antibody a-h-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as
primary antibodies.
Cells grown on chamber slides. MDA-231-B/Luc+ cells were seeded at
a density of 20,000/cm2 in DMEM with 0.1% FCII in eight chamber slides
(Falcon, Becton Dickinson), and growth factors were added after 18 h.
After 30 h, cells were dried for 5 min and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde
(pH 6.8; Merck, VWR) in PBS for 10 min and stained for vimentin as
described for tissues, with the exception of the antigen retrieval step (see
section ‘histomorphometry, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry’).
Images were acquired using a color charge-coupled device (CCD) camera
mounted on a Nikon Eclipse 610 microscope at a 20-fold magnification.
Subsequently, cells were scored double blind for positive vimentin staining
from four randomly chosen fields by two investigators (J.T.B. and
P.G.M.v.O.).
Transient transfections and transcription reporter assays. MDA-231
cells were seeded at a density of 7,500 cells/cm2 in DMEM with 10% FCII in
24-well plates. On the subsequent day, cells were transiently transfected
with 1 Ag of the indicated constructs using Fugene 6 (Roche) transfection
reagent following manufacturer’s protocol. To correct for transfection
efficacy, 100 ng Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV or pRL-CAGGS, both from
Promega) was cotransfected. On day 3, cells were serum starved for 24 h
before stimulation with TGF-h and/or BMP7 for a duration of 30 h. On day
5, luciferase activities were quantified using Dual-Luciferase Assay
(Promega; ref. 37). Firefly luciferase activity was corrected for Renilla
luciferase activity. The experiments were done in 4-fold and repeated at
least twice. Values are expressed as mean F SE.
Luciferase reporter gene constructs. For intracellular signaling of
TGF-h, the CAGA-luciferase construct, consisting of 12 Smad3/Smad4
binding sequences (CAGA boxes) and the luciferase-coding sequence, was
used. The CAGA boxes confer TGF-h stimulation to a heterologous
promoter reporter construct, whose activity depends on binding of
activated Smad3/Smad4 transcription factor complexes (37).
The BRE-luciferase construct, which is based on the mouse Id1 promoter,
was used to study the presence and functionality of BMP receptors (38).
Animals. Female nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu) were purchased from
Charles River. Animals were housed in individual ventilated cages under
sterile condition, and sterile food and water were provided ad libitum.
Animal experiments were approved by the local committee for animal
health, ethics and research of Leiden University and carried out in
accordance with European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC. For
surgical and analytical procedures, mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection
of a 50 AL 1:1:1 mixture; ketamine HCl (stock solution of 100 mg/mL
Nimatek, Vetimex Animal Health B.V.) + xylazine (2% Rompun, Bayer AG) +
PBS (pH 6.8). At the end of the experimental period, animals were sacrificed
by cervical dislocation.

Animal models. All cells were harvested at 70% to 80% confluence after
changing to geneticin-free medium 24 h before inoculation.
For tumor growth in the bone marrow, single-cell suspensions of 2.5  105
MDA-231-B/Luc+ cells/10 AL PBS were injected into the right tibiae of
6-week-old mice as described previously (28, 39).
Three days after intraosseous inoculation of MDA-231-B/Luc+ cells, the
animals were equally distributed into three experimental groups based on a
comparable tumor burden/mouse, as detected by whole-body bioluminescent reporter imaging (BLI). From this time point (day 0) and during
a subsequent period of 24 days, all animals received vehicle or rhBMP7
(10 or 100 Ag/kg/d) treatment by tail vein injection. The progression of
intraosseous growth was monitored by BLI at days 3, 10, 17, and 24 and by
radiography at days 17 and 24 (28, 39).
Six-week-old mice were also intraosseous inoculated (1.0  105 cells/10 AL
PBS) with either MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(GFP)/Luc+ cells (n = 8) or MDA231-BO2-Frt11(BMP7)/Luc+ cells (n = 5). The progression was monitored
by BLI weekly and by radiography at the end of the experiment (day 28;
refs. 28, 39).

For orthotopic tumor growth, single-cell suspensions of 1.0  106 MDA231-B/Luc+ cells/10 AL PBS were inoculated via a 0.5 mL U-100 insulin needle
(29G 1/2, BD Micro-Fine, Becton Dickinson) into the mammary fat pads of
7-week-old mice. Animals were equally distributed into two experimental
groups based on a comparable tumor burden/mouse, as detected by
BLI. From this time point (day 0), all animals were given vehicle or BMP7
(100 Ag/kg/d) treatment by tail vein injection. Subsequently, the progression
of orthotopically growing tumors was monitored weekly by BLI (28, 39).
Nude mice (4.5 weeks old) were inoculated (5.0  105 cells/100 AL PBS)
in the tail artery with either MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(GFP)/Luc+ cells (n = 13)
or MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(BMP7)/Luc+ cells (n = 8), as described earlier (31).
The progression was monitored by BLI weekly and by radiography at the
end of the experiment (day 28; refs. 28, 39).
After the experimental periods, mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation.
Mammary fat pads and tibiae with tumors were dissected and processed
for further histomorphometrical and immunohistochemical analysis (see
below).

Whole-body BLI of isogenic BMP7- and GFP-overexpressing cell
lines. In animals that were inoculated with either MDA-231-BO2Frt11(GFP)/Luc+ or MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(BMP7)/Luc+, the luciferase activity
was visualized through imaging of whole bodies with an intensified CCD
video camera of the in vivo Imaging System (IVIS 100, Xenogen). The
animals were anesthetized using the isofluorane anesthesia system (XGI-8,
Xenogen) and injected i.p. with 2 mg D-luciferin sodium salt (Synchem
OHG) dissolved in PBS. Animals were kept anesthetized, and measurements
were done 5 min after the injection of D-luciferin. Bioluminescence imaging
was acquired with a 15-cm FOV, a medium binning factor, and exposure
times of 10 to 60 s. Imaging data were analyzed by using the program living
image (Xenogen). Values are expressed as relative light units (RLU) in
photons per seconds.
Radiographical analysis. Radiographic analyses of osteolytic lesions
were assessed by radiography (Kodak X-OMAT TL film, Eastman Kodak Co.)
using a Hewlett Packard X-ray system Faxitron 43805 and quantified using
NIH Image 1.62b7 software as described earlier (39).

Goldner staining, staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP),
H&E staining, or immunohistochemical staining as described previously
(39, 40). Histomorphometric measurements of tumor burden were done on
central sections through the tumor (largest tumor area). Tumor growth in
bone could be readily identified by pancytokeratin staining alone or in
combination with H&E staining. Total tumor areas, as an estimate of total
tumor burden, was measured by image analysis using NIH Image 1.62b7
image analyses software as described previously (39). Subsequently, a
distinction was made between the total tumor burden and the intraosseous
and extraosseous tumor burden as described previously (39).
The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used at a concentration
of 10 Ag/mL: a-human pancytokeratin (DAKO), a-human vimentin
(ab7783), a-human BMP7 (2854ab, directed against prodomain of BMP7,
obtained from Dr. Vukicevic; refs. 35, 41), a-phosphorylated Smad1 (PS1; ref.
42), and normal rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) antibodies as
negative control. Goat a-rabbit IgG (DAKO) was used as secondary
antibody. For antigen retrieval, slides were treated for 10 min at 37jC with
5 Ag/mL proteinase K (Invitrogen). To quantify PS1 and TRAcP staining,
three histological sections per mouse (n = 8) were acquired using a color

scored single blind by two investigators (G.v.d.P. and P.G.M.v.O.).
BMP7 staining on patient material was done similarly, except that 5%
normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch)/0.5% Boehringer Milk
Powder (Boehringer Mannheim)/TTBS was used instead of 0.5% Boehringer
Milk Powder/TTBS for incubation and first antibody dilution, and 0.01 mol/L
citrate buffer (pH 6.0; 7 min at 98jC) was used as antigen retrieval step, unless
stated otherwise.
Statistical analysis. Survival rates were determined using the log-rank
test. Because BMP7 mRNA levels in patients did not follow a Gaussian
distribution, (a) the mRNA levels in each subgroup of samples were
characterized by their median values and ranges, rather than their mean
values and coefficients of variation and (b) relationships between the
molecular markers and clinical and histological variables were tested using
the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Other data are represented as
mean F SE. In vivo tumor growth was analyzed by general linear model
with repeated measurements using a least significant difference (LSD) post
hoc test when applicable. Other statistical evaluations were carried out by
ANOVA using a LSD post hoc test when applicable.

in primary breast tumors developing bone or visceral metastases
were not significantly different from breast cancer patients without
relapse (Supplementary Table S2, column 2 versus 1), and there was
no significant difference observed that patients with primary breast
tumors developing bone metastases had lower BMP7 mRNA
expression levels (P = 0.13; Supplementary Table S2, column 3
versus 1) than patients without relapse. However, BMP7 mRNA
expression levels in primary breast tumors developing bone
metastases were significantly lower when compared with primary
breast tumors developing visceral (lung and/or liver) metastases
(P = 0.027; Supplementary Table S2, column 3 versus 4).
In patient-matched normal ducts of the breast, apical BMP7
staining could be observed (Fig. 1, top). Staining intensity of BMP7
protein in primary breast cancer specimens was in accordance
with BMP7 mRNA levels (Fig. 1, middle). Adult kidneys were used

MCF10CA1a and MDA-231 and its derivate MDA-231-B/Luc+ are
highly tumorigenic and metastatic. This arrangement of the cell
lines inversely correlates with the expression of BMP7 (Fig. 2A).
E-cadherin/vimentin expression ratios, indicative of epithelial
phenotype, are also related to BMP7 expression (Fig. 2A), suggesting
that acquisition of an invasive phenotype coincides with decreased
BMP7 expression.
Immunohistochemical staining of MDA-231-B/Luc+ cells for
vimentin showed a heterogeneous population with 22% vimentinpositive cells (Fig. 2B). Stimulation with BMP7 significantly
decreased the percentage of vimentin-positive cells (5%; P =

0.038 versus control), whereas stimulation with TGF-h significantly
increased the percentage of vimentin-positive cells (49%; P = 0.002
versus control). This increase in vimentin expression by TGF-h
could be blocked completely by coincubation of BMP7 (12%
vimentin-positive cells; P < 0.001 versus TGF-h–treated cells).
These results were further confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2C).
Next, we tested whether BMP7 acts on MDA-231 cells to inhibit
the acquisition of an invasive, mesenchymal phenotype by
antagonizing Smad-dependent TGF-h signaling.
The presence of functionally active TGF-h receptor complexes,
particularly ALK5, in MDA-231 cells was shown by the dosedependent activation of the CAGA-luciferase reporter, whose
activity depends on activated Smad3/Smad4 transcription factor

complexes (Fig. 2D). Addition of BMP7 to TGF-h–stimulated MDA231 cells significantly inhibited the TGF-h–driven CAGA-luciferase
activity (P < 0.001).
Addition of BMP7, but not TGF-h, stimulated BRE4-luciferase
activity, indicating the presence of functioning, activated type I
BMP receptor complexes in MDA-231 cells (Fig. 2D). TGF-h
antagonizes BMP7–induced BRE-luciferase activity (P < 0.001).
It is important to note that BMP7 did not affect proliferation of
MDA-231-B/Luc+ cells in vitro using different cell culture
conditions (1% FCS and 10% FCS; Supplementary Fig. S1).
BMP7 overexpression and experimental bone metastasis. As
detected with ELISA, overexpression of BMP7 in MDA-231 cells
[MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(BMP7)/Luc+] resulted in substantial secretion of BMP7 protein in the medium, 6.55 ng BMP7 protein/106
cells/d. In contrast, BMP7 protein was not detectable in the control
cell line [MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(GFP)/Luc+], <0.03 ng BMP7 protein/
106 cells/d.
Overexpression of BMP7 in MDA-231 cells [MDA-231-BO2Frt11(BMP7)/Luc+] significantly inhibited both the intrabone
growth (P = 0.034), osteolytic area (P = 0.007), and extraosseous

extension (P = 0.042) when compared with control [MDA-231-BO2Frt11(GFP)/Luc+; Fig. 3A]. Moreover, in an experimental model of
bone metastasis using tail inoculation of breast cancer cells,
overexpression of BMP7 in MDA-231 cells [MDA-231-BO2Frt11(BMP7)/Luc+] was shown to significantly inhibit the number
of osteolytic lesions (P = 0.025; Fig. 3B and C). In line with the ELISA
data described above, overexpression of BMP7 protein in tumor cells
was also detected in histological sections in bone metastasis from
MDA-231 cells overexpressing BMP7 [MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(BMP7)/
Luc+], but not in the GFP control cell line (Fig. 3B). In addition, a
trend was noticed for less overall total tumor burden as detected by
BLI (P = 0.10; Fig. 3C). Furthermore, it is important to note that
BMP7 overexpression did not affect the growth rate in vitro
[doubling time MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(BMP7)/Luc+ cells: 21.0 h versus
MDA-231-BO2-Frt11(GFP)/Luc+ cells: 20.9 h].

bone. Breast cancer growth in bone and the formation of osteolytic
lesions was strongly inhibited, particularly in the high-dose BMP7
group (100 Ag/kg/d BMP7; Fig. 4A). Remarkably, mice receiving
100 Ag/kg/d BMP7 had tumors that express higher levels of
cytokeratins and lower levels of vimentin when compared with
vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4B). The number of strong cytokeratinpositive cells was increased by 25% on BMP7 treatment. This
indicates that BMP7 treatment provokes a more epithelial-like
phenotype.
In the vehicle-treated group, the tumor burden increased
strongly over time (Fig. 5A). Tumor growth in mice receiving
10 Ag/kg/d BMP7 was not significantly different from vehicletreated animals, whereas 100 Ag/kg/d BMP7 strongly and
significantly inhibited tumor progression (P = 0.038; Fig. 5A). This
result was confirmed by histomorphometric analysis of total tumor
burden (P = 0.049; Fig. 5A). In addition, no significant difference
was observed in extraosseous tumor volume on BMP7 treatment
(100 Ag/kg/d; P = 0.15; Fig. 5A). Furthermore, radiographic analysis
of the tibiae revealed that mice receiving 100 Ag/kg/d BMP7 show
significantly smaller bone lesions (P = 0.046), although number of
osteoclasts per millimeter bone cortex seemed not to be different
at the end of the experiment (P = 0.528; Fig. 5B). Systemic
administration of BMP7 for the duration of the experiment can
directly act on MDA-231-B/Luc+ bone metastatic cells as visualized
by significantly enhanced nuclear staining for PS1 when compared
with vehicle-treated animals (P = 0.0097; Fig. 5C).

Next, we studied the effects of BMP7 treatment on the growth
of MDA-231-B/Luc+ cells that were orthotopically implanted into
the mammary fat pads of nude mice (Fig. 6A–C). Figure 6B
depicts a representative example from both experimental groups
(vehicle and 100 Ag/kg/d BMP7) as detected by BLI and
histomorphometry. Tumor growth of the orthotopically implanted
breast cancer cells in mice receiving 100 Ag/kg/d BMP7 was
significantly inhibited versus vehicle-treated animals (P = 0.049;
Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Although BMP7 has been proposed as a marker of differentiation
in normal and breast cancer cells (43), the role of BMP7 in breast
cancer progression has remained largely elusive (43–45). In this
report, novel evidence is provided for a role of BMP7 in breast
cancer development and bone metastases. We describe here that
BMP7 expression in patients with primary breast tumors
exclusively developing bone metastases is significantly lower than
in primary breast tumors developing exclusively visceral (lung and/
or liver) metastases. These clinical findings suggest that decreased
BMP7 expression may confer a bone metastatic potential to human
breast cancer cells. Normal ducts of the breast display strong apical
BMP7 protein expression. BMP7 protein expression in patientmatched lymph node metastases was low or absent and, as a
consequence, generally lower than in normal ducts and primary

breast carcinomas.9 Strikingly, BMP7 seems to be expressed
predominantly in tumor cells in the solid tumor area rather than
in migratory tumor cells outside this area (43), indicating that low
BMP7 expression may support the acquisition of a more migratory
invasive phenotype.
It has been well established that the process of EMT provides
mechanisms for breast epithelial cells to overcome physical
constraints imposed on them by intercellular junctions and adopt
a motile phenotype (3, 8, 46). It is becoming increasingly clear that
this local invasive process, representing initial stages of the
metastatic cascade during carcinogenesis, is adapted from the
remarkable epithelial plasticity (EMT) that occurs during embryonic development and postnatal tissue maintenance (2, 47). In
many cancers, TGF-h is a protumorigenic factor that stimulates
‘oncogenic’ EMT (8, 17, 18). In contrast, BMP7 is a strong inducer of
the reverse process (MET) during embryonic development
(9–11, 14) and in renal fibroblasts (22). Moreover, BMP7 can
inhibit TGF-h–induced fibrosis (25) and counteracts TGF-h–
induced EMT in normal renal epithelial cells (24).
We show here that BMP7 mRNA expression is inversely related
to tumorigenicity and invasive behavior of human breast cancer
cell lines. Functional studies reveal that BMP7 overexpression by
breast cancer cells inhibits de novo formation of osteolytic bone
metastases and, hence, the metastatic capability of breast cancer
cells in our in vivo bone metastasis model. Furthermore, BMP7
overexpression significantly inhibited tumor growth in bone. In
keeping with these functional data, daily systemic administration
of BMP7 strongly and significantly impairs both the orthotopic and
intraosseous growth of human MDA-231-B/Luc+ breast cancer cells
in nude mice.
Our in vitro studies reveal for the first time that BMP7 is a potent
inhibitor of TGF-h–induced EMT in MDA-231 cancer cells. In these
cells, BMP7 is able to counteract Smad-dependent TGF-h signaling.
These actions of BMP7 may be of critical importance and could
explain the observed beneficial effects of experimental BMP7
treatment on orthotopic growth and skeletal metastasis. In this
context, it is important to note that inactive TGF-h is concentrated

and stored in high amounts in extracellular bone matrix and can be
released and activated by osteoclastic resorption. Activated bone
matrix–derived TGF-h may act as a paracrine growth factor for
neighboring osteolytic cancer cells that may have colonized the
bone marrow (21, 40, 48). Our in vivo data further support this
notion because BMP7 antagonizes TGF-h signaling routes in
human breast cancer cells that are metastatic to the skeleton. We
hypothesize that the activation process of micrometastases in bone
marrow may bear similarities to EMT that occurs at the primary
site in various epithelial cancers and during ontogeny (49).
Exogenous BMP7, however, could not restore E-cadherin
expression in MDA-231-B/Luc+ cells. Recent observations support
the notion that hypermethylation of the E-cadherin promoter in
MDA-231 cells is involved in E-cadherin expression (6). Apparently,
BMP7 cannot overcome this epigenetic effect.
It is important to note that comparable data have been obtained
in clinical samples of prostate cancer (50) and uveal melanoma.10
Moreover, in human prostate cancer, we observed recently that
BMP7 antagonizes TGF-h–induced EMT concomitant with an
induction of E-cadherin expression (50).
Collectively, our data suggest that BMP7 regulates epithelial
homeostasis in the human mammary gland by preserving the
epithelial phenotype. Decreased BMP7 expression during breast
cancer progression may, therefore, contribute to the acquisition of
a bone metastatic phenotype. Furthermore, exogenous BMP7 can
still inhibit breast cancer growth at the primary site and in bone
marrow. Therefore, BMP7 may represent a novel therapeutic
molecule for repression of local and bone metastatic growth of
human breast cancer.
