ABSTRACT
To generate functional human hepatocytes from stem cells and/or extrahepatic tissues could provide an important source of cells for treating liver diseases.
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have an unlimited plasticity since they can
dedifferentiate and transdifferentiate to other cell lineages. However, generation of
mature and functional hepatocytes from human SSCs has not yet been achieved. Here
we have for the first time reported direct transdifferentiation of human SSCs to mature
and functional hepatocytes by three-step induction using the defined condition medium.
Human SSCs were first transdifferentiated to hepatic stem cells, as evidenced by their
morphology and biopotential nature of co-expressing hepatocyte and cholangiocyte
markers but not hallmarks for embryonic stem cells. Hepatic stem cells were further
induced to differentiate into mature hepatocytes identified by their morphological
traits and strong expression of CK8, CK18, ALB, AAT, TF, TAT, and cytochrome enzymes
rather than CK7 or CK19. Significantly, mature hepatocytes derived from human SSCs
assumed functional attributes of human hepatocytes, because they could produce
albumin, remove ammonia, and uptake and release indocyanine green. Moreover,
expression of β-CATENIN, HNF4A, FOXA1 and GATA4 was upregulated during the
transdifferentiation of human SSCs to mature hepatocytes. Collectively, human SSCs
could directly transdifferentiate to mature and functional hepatocytes. This study could
offer an invaluable source of human hepatocytes for curing liver disorders and drug
toxicology screening and provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying human
liver regeneration.

INTRODUCTION

been suggested as a promisingly alternative therapy
for liver-related diseases [4]. It has been reported that a
number of patients could recover the function of liver
through human fetal hepatocyte transplantation [5, 6].
In addition, hepatocyte transplantation may possess several
advantages over the whole-liver transplantation: i) it is
technically simple; ii) it can facilitate multiple treatment of
a single patient; and iii) it is “reversible” since the native
liver does not need to be removed [6]. Unfortunately,
the availability of primary human hepatocytes is rather
limited, and these cells are hard to proliferate and have
short-term viability in vitro [7]. Therefore, it is urgently

Allogeneic liver transplantation has been regarded
as an effective treatment for the end-stage and inherited
liver diseases [1, 2]. However, severe shortage of
liver donors restricts the clinical applications of liver
transplantation [3]. As examples, there are 18,000
patients waiting for liver transplantation in the United
States of America, but only 5,000 donated livers are
available per year [1]. As a result, numerous patients
with liver disorders die before liver transplantation can
be performed. Human hepatocyte transplantation has

required to seek an ideal cell source from stem cells and/
or extra-liver tissues to generate mature and functional
human hepatocytes for treating patients with the endstage and/or inherited liver diseases. In addition to the
therapeutic application, generation of human hepatocytes
from stem cells and human other tissues could be utilized
for liver disease modeling as well as drug and toxicity
screening.
Stem cells have recently become the most promising
source of hepatocytes. A number of studies have shown
that hepatocytes can be derived from embryonic stem (ES)
cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and the induced pluripotent
stem (iPS) cells [8–10]. The transplantation of hepatocytes
derived from stem cells can recover liver damage [11–13].
However, there are certain hurdles and unresolved risk
before the eventual usage of these stem cells in clinic,
e.g., ethical issues with ES cells, tumorigenesis and the
risk of virus infection associated with the iPS cells [2].
Thus, it is essential to search for a readily available source
from adult stem cells for cell-based therapy of human
hepatocytes. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have an
unlimited plasticity since they can dedifferentiate and
transdifferentiate to other cell lineages. However, the
generation of mature and functional hepatocytes from
human SSCs in vitro has not yet been achieved.
SSCs are a subpopulation of type A spermatogonia
in mammalian testis [14]. Increasing evidence has
demonstrated that SSCs from both mouse and human testes
can acquire pluripotency and can dedifferentiate into ESlike cells which subsequently differentiate into various cell
lineages of three germ layers [15–18]. Nevertheless, the
ES-like cell stage is adverse to clinical application due to
potential tumorigenesis. Notably, it has been shown that
mouse SSCs could transdifferentiate into prostatic, uterine,
and skin epithelium without the ES-like cell stage in vivo
[19]. In this study, we proposed a novel concept that human
SSCs can directly transdifferentiate to mature and functional
hepatocytes, which achieved two significant endpoints.
First of all, direct transdifferentiation of SSCs to human
hepatocytes without the process of dedifferentiation to ESlike cells and embryonic body formation could simplify the
reprogramming procedure. Secondly and importantly, our
direct transdifferentiation using growth factors and hormone
without gene transduction could be much safer to generate
mature and functional human hepatocytes for cell therapy of
liver diseases. Here we present a detailed induction protocol
as well as molecular and cellular evidence supporting
direct transdifferentiation of human SSCs to the cells
with morphological, phenotypic and functional features
of mature human hepatocytes. Significantly, our ability of
generating mature and functional human hepatocytes from
patients’ SSCs could provide an invaluable and new cell
source for the treatment of liver diseases without ethical
issues and immune rejection. This study also sheds a
new insight into molecular mechanisms underlying liver
development and regeneration.

Identification and characterization of human
SSCs
Human SSCs were separated by a two-step
enzymatic digestion and magnetic-activated cell sorting
(MACS) using an antibody against GPR125 pursuant to
the method as previously described [20]. The identity
of freshly isolated cells was characterized using various
markers for male germ cells and SSCs. RT-PCR showed
that the transcripts of VASA, GPR125, UCHL1, PLZF,
GFRA1, RET, and MAGEA4 were present in the freshly
isolated cells (Figure 1A). RNA without RT but PCR
with GAPDH was used a negative control (NC), and
no PCR product was seen in these cells (Figure 1A),
thus confirming the specific expression of these
genes in the freshly isolated human male germ cells.
Immunocytochemistry revealed that UCHL1 (Figure 1B),
PLZF (Figure 1C), and MAGEA4 (Figure 1E) were
expressed in the freshly isolated human male germ cells.
Double immunostaining further displayed that GFRA1
and GPR125 were co-expressed in these cells (Figure 1D).
Replacement of primary antibodies with isotype IgGs,
and no immunostaining was observed in the freshly
isolated cells (Figure 1F), thus verifying specific
staining of these proteins in these cells. In addition, the
expression of GPR125 (Figure 1G) and PLZF (Figure 1H)
was undetected in GPR125-negative cells by MACS.
Together, these results suggest that the freshly isolated
human male germ cells are phenotypically human SSCs.

Direct transdifferentiation of human SSCs to
hepatic stem cells
To induce the transdifferentiation of human SSCs
to hepatic stem cells, we mimicked the condition for liver
embryonic development using the conditioned medium
containing Activin A, bFGF, and Wnt3a (Figure 2A). After
10 days of induction, human SSCs proliferated slightly
(Figure 2B-i), and their morphology were changed and
became oval and stereoscopic in shape (Figure 2B-ii).
Under phase-contrast microscope, the cells assumed a
higher ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm and few organelles,
which was similar to hepatic oval cells (termed hepatic
stem cells).
We next examined the phenotypic characteristics of
the cells induced from human SSCs at transcriptional and
translational levels in order to clarify their identities. RTPCR analyses showed that the cells derived from human
SSCs expressed both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic
specific genes, e.g., CK7, CK19, CK8, CK18, ALB, HNF4A,
FOXA1, GATA4, and AFP (Figure 3A, Figure 4A, lane 2).
Double immunostaining displayed that over 80% of the
cells derived from human SSCs were co-expressing CK18
(a marker for hepatic cells) and CK19 (a hallmark for

biliary epithelial cells) (Figure 3B), thus demonstrating
their bipotency in nature. The high conversion rate was
consistent with our data of flow cytometry showing
that 81.2% of the cells derived from human SSCs were
positive for both CK18 and CK19 (Figure 3C, right panel).
Immunocytochemistry further revealed that AFP, a specific
marker of hepatic stem cells, was highly expressed in the
cells derived from human SSCs (Figure 3D). In addition,
GPR125 (Figure 3E) and VASA (Figure 3F) were hardly
or undetected in these cells derived from human SSCs.
Collectively, these data implicate that human SSCs were
converted into hepatic stem cells.
We asked whether human SSCs dedifferentiated into
ES-like cells during the conversion process. It has been
reported that mouse and human SSCs can dedifferentiate
into ES-like cells which subsequently produce endoderm
lineages of cells [15–18]. The ES-like cells derived from

SSCs acquire ES cell properties, since they are positive for
OCT4, SSEA4, SSEA3, TRA1–60, and TRA1–81 [15–18].
Notably, we didn’t detect the expression of ES cell
markers, including TRA1–60 (Figure 3G), SSEA3 and
TRA1–81 (Figure 3H), in the cells derived from human
SSCs, reflecting that human SSCs didn’t dedifferentiate
into ES-like cells and that they directly transdifferentiated
to hepatic stem cells.

Differentiation of human SSCs-derived hepatic
stem cells into hepatocytes
Hepatic stem cells are bipotent since they
can differentiate to both hepatic lineage and biliary
epithelial cells. We made endeavors to further induce the
differentiation of hepatic stem cells derived from SSCs
using hepatocyte culture medium (HCM) supplemented

Generation of human mature hepatocytes from
human SSCs

with HGF. After 5–10 days of induction (Figure 2A),
hepatic stem cells derived from human SSCs could
proliferate and they changed the morphology similar
to small hepatocytes (Figure 2B-iii). In addition, we
assessed biochemical phenotype of these cells to probe
their identity. As shown in Figure 4A, lane 3, the cells
derived from hepatic stem cells expressed both CK8
and CK18 transcripts at high levels, whereas CK19 and
CK7 mRNA was significantly reduced in these cells,
which implicates that under HCM and HGF induction
hepatic stem cells differentiated to small hepatocytes but
not biliary lineage cells. Immunocytochemistry further
confirmed RT-PCR results. As shown in Figure 4B, the
cells derived from hepatic stem cells co-expressed ALB
and CK8 proteins. Double immunostaining revealed
that CK18 protein was detected in the cells derived
from human SSCs (Figure 4C), and in contrast, CK19
protein was undetected in these cells (Figure 4C).
Furthermore, the cells derived from human hepatic
stem cells expressed a number of hepatocyte-specific
genes at low levels, e.g., ALB, TDO, TF, AAT, TAT,
and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes including
CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP7A1 (Figure 5A, lane 3).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that the hepatic
stem cells derived from human SSCs differentiated to
small hepatocytes but not cholangiocytes.

It has been reported that HGF, oncostain M (OSM)
and dexamethasone (Dex) promote hepatocyte maturation
[21]. Therefore, we employed the combination of HGF,
OSM and Dex to further facilitate the maturation of small
hepatocytes. After 10 days of treatment (Figure 2A),
the cells changed their morphology and became polygonal
appearance (Figure 2B-iv), which was similar to the
morphology of primary human hepatocytes. We next probed
the expression of specific hepatic markers in the cells at
both transcriptional and translational levels. As shown in
Figure 4A, lane 4, high levels of CK8 and CK18 but not
CK7 or CK19 were observed in the cells derived from
human SSCs. Notably, the cells derived from primary
human SSCs had strong mRNA expression of ALB,
TAT, TDO, TF, AAT, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP7A1
(Figure 5A, lane 4). Furthermore, immunocytochemistry
by single and double staining revealed that the
cells derived from human SSCs induced by HGF,
OSM and Dex were positive for AAT (Figure 5B),
ALB and CYP1A2 (Figure 5C). Considered together,
these results suggest that small hepatocytes derived from
human SSCs differentiated into mature hepatocytes with
morphological and phenotypic features.

Mature hepatocytes derived from human
SSCs assumed functional attributes of human
hepatocytes

The expression of b-CATENIN, transcript
factors and cell cycle regulators during the
transdifferentiation of human SSCs into
functional hepatocytes

We measured albumin synthesis, urea production,
and indocyanine green (ICG) uptake and release to test
whether mature human hepatocytes derived from human
SSCs assumed functional attributes of hepatocytes.
Urea production is a characteristic of mature hepatocyte
function. Urea assay showed that the differentiated cells
from human SSCs could remove ammonia from culture
medium (Figure 6A). Albumin synthesis assay is a specific
test for the presence and metabolic activity of mature
hepatocytes. As shown in Figure 6B, the cells derived
from human SSCs possessed the capacity to produce
albumin (0.43 ± 0.07 μg/ml/105 cells), although albumin
production was relatively lower than human hepatocyte
line L02 cells. The ICG test has been used to examine the
function of mature hepatocytes to assess their ability of
excretion for endogenous and exogenous compounds. As
shown in Figure 6C, ICG-positive staining was clearly
seen in the cells derived from human SSCs. Notably,
the ICG uptake in human SSCs-derived hepatocytes was
excreted by 12 hours after removal of ICG from culture
medium (Figure 6D). The uptake and release of ICG from
mature hepatocytes was comparable to those of human
hepatocyte line L02 cells (Figure 6E–6F). In parallel,
ICG uptake was not observed in human germline stem
cell line [22] without HGF, OSM or Dex treatment (data
not shown). Collectively, our results clearly indicate that
the cells derived from human SSCs possess functional
attributes of primary human hepatocytes.

To gain novel insights into molecular mechanisms
underlying the transdifferentiation of human SSCs into
mature hepatocytes, we asked what signaling pathway
was involved during this conversion process. As shown
in Figure 7A, immunocytochemistry showed that the
expression of β-CATENIN protein was upregulated
in hepatic stem cells, small hepatocytes, and mature
hepatocytes derived from human SSCs compared to
human SSCs. RT-PCR further revealed that β-CATENIN
transcript was enhanced remarkably during the conversion
process (Figure 7B–7C). Furthermore, the expression
of transcription factors HNF4A, FOXA1 and GATA4,
was increased gradually from human SSCs to mature
hepatocytes (Figure 7D–7G).
We further examined expression changes of
CYCLIN A2, CYCLIN B1, CYCLIN D1, CYCLIN E1,
CDK1, CDK2, P53 and P21 transcripts during the
transdifferentiation of human SSCs to mature hepatocytes.
As shown in Figure 8A–8F, RT-PCR analysis revealed
that CYCLIN A2, CYCLIN E1 and CDK2 transcripts were
enhanced significantly in mature hepatocytes compared to
human SSCs, hepatic stem cells and small hepatocytes,
suggesting that these cell cycle proteins are involved
in hepatocyte maturation. No obvious change in the
transcripts of CYCLIN B1, CYCLIN D1, CDK1, P21 and
P53 was observed during the conversion of human SSCs
to mature hepatocytes.

DISCUSSION

thus selected to coax the transdifferentiation of human
SSCs into the cells with morphological and phenotypic
characteristics of hepatic stem cells. In morphology, the
cells derived from human SSCs resembled hepatic stem
cells, since they were oval and stereoscopic in appearance
and they possessed stem cell properties. In phenotype, the
cells derived from human SSCs expressed specific genes
of hepatic stem cells, including CK7, CK19, CK8, CK18,
ALB, and AFP. Immunocytochemistry further confirmed
the co-expression of CK18 and CK19 of these cells, which
are hallmarks for hepatic cells and bile epithelial cells,
respectively. Taken together, these results at transcription
and translation levels suggest that the cells derived from
human SSCs assume biopotential nature of hepatic stem
cells. Significantly, the conversion of human SSCs to
hepatic stem cells was relatively efficient using our
induction procedure compared to human ES cells or iPS
cells, because more than 80% of human SSCs could be
converted into human hepatic stem cells, as evidenced by
our double immunostaining and flow cytometry analyses.
Generation of mature hepatocytes from human ES cells
seems to be inefficient due to the low purity (70%) and
large cellular heterogeneity [34], while hepatocytes
derived from iPS cells have a limited regeneration of
the liver [35]. It is worth noting that the cells derived
from human SSCs didn’t express the ES cell markers,
including SSEA3, TRA1-60, and TRA1-81, suggesting
that human SSCs directly transdifferentiated to hepatic
stem cells without dedifferentiation to ES-like cells, which
is essential for simplifying differentiation procedure and
improving safety for their clinical applications.
Hepatic stem cells are biopotential since they can
differentiate to both biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes
[36]. HGF is required for liver development and it is
associated with the ontogenesis of liver [37]. Hepatocyte
differentiation can be induced from mesenchymal stem
cells by HGF and other growth factors [38]. Here we
found that HGF and HCM could induce hepatic stem
cells derived from human SSCs to differentiate into small
hepatocytes. In phenotype, the cells derived from human
SSCs expressed the hallmarks for hepatocytes, including
ALB, TAT, TDO, AAT, TF, and CYP450 enzymes
CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP7A1, whereas the expression
of CK19 and CK7 (markers for bile epithelial cells) was
remarkably reduced or undetected. Small hepatocytes
were further induced to become mature in HCM
supplemented with OSM and Dex. In morphology, the
cells derived from human SSCs became polygonal with a
low nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. Under phenotype, these cells
expressed numerous hepatocyte markers, including ALB,
TAT, TDO, TF, AAT, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP7A1,
and they were negative for CK19 or CK7, hallmarks
for bile epithelial cells. Notably, the cells derived from
human SSCs possessed numerous functional properties
of primary human hepatocytes, e.g., albumin synthesis,
ammonia clearance, and uptake and release of ICG. Taken

It has been reported that hepatic stem cells can
differentiate into hepatocytes [23–25]. However, it is hard
to obtain human hepatic stem cells due to the scarcity of
human liver tissues. Therefore, more attention has been
paid to generate hepatocytes from extra-liver source and
other adult stem cells. We have previously shown that
mouse SSCs could directly transdifferentiate into mature
hepatocytes using the conditioned medium [26]. Notably,
there are distinct differences in cell types and phenotype
of SSCs between human and mice [20]. With regard to
the identity of SSCs, Adark and Apale spermatogonia have
been regarded as human SSCs, whereas As spermatogonia
are generally considered the actual mouse SSCs. There
are also phenotypic differences in SSCs between human
and rodents. As an example, POU5F1 (Oct-4) is a marker
of mouse SSCs, whereas it is not present in human SSCs
[20]. Similarly, KIT is regarded as a marker for mouse
differentiating spermatogonia, but it is undetected in
human spermatogonia [20]. To generate functional and
mature cells from human SSCs has certain advantages
over other cells. Firstly, human SSCs assume unlimited
potentials compared to other adult stem cells, since they
can acquire pluripotency to become ES-like cells. Secondly,
human SSCs can transdifferentiate to cell lineages of other
tissues, highlighting their great plasticity. Thirdly, human
SSCs have no ethical concern associated with human
ES cells. Finally, there is no risk of virus infection and
tumorigenesis to utilize human SSCs compared with human
iPS cells. Here we have for the first time demonstrated that
human SSCs could directly transdifferentiate to the cells
with morphological, phenotypic and functional attributes
of human mature hepatocytes.
We first isolated and purified human SSCs from the
testis tissues of OA patients using enzymatic digestion
and MACS and verified the identity of these cells using
a variety of markers for germ cells and SSCs. VASA has
been recognized as a maker for germ cells [27], while
MAGEA4 and UCHL1 are hallmarks for spermatogonia
[28]. GFRA1 and RET are co-receptors for GDNF and
they have been generally regarded as markers for SSCs
[29, 30], while GPR125 and PLZF are considered
hallmarks for human SSCs [20]. We found that the freshly
isolated human male germ cells expressed VASA, UCHL1,
MAGEA4, GFRA1, RET, GPR125 and PLZF, implicating
that these cells are actually human SSCs in phenotype.
We mimicked the condition for liver development
to induce the transdifferentiation of human SSCs to
functional hepatocytes. It has been reported that canonical
Wnt pathway is involved in specifying definitive
endoderm and it induces direct conversion of non-hepatic
endodermal cells into hepatocytes [31], and bFGF is
essential to initiate the onset of hepatic development [32].
Activin A can efficiently induce endoderm differentiation
of human ES cells [33]. Wnt3a, bFGF and Activin A were

together, these data indicate that human SSCs can directly
transdifferentiate to cells with morphology, phenotype and
function of human mature hepatocytes.
It remains unknown about what signaling pathways
are activated in the transdifferentiation process of human
SSCs to mature hepatocytes. Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway has been suggested to play a crucial role in liver
development [39]. It has been reported that Wnt/β-catenin
signaling is required for liver specification, hepatoblast
proliferation and differentiation, and conditional knockout
of β-catenin in hepatoblast results in underdeveloped liver
[40, 41]. Here we found that the expression of β-CATENIN
and its downstream targets including HNF4A, FOXA1 and
GATA4 was enhanced during the transdifferentiation of
human SSCs into functional hepatocytes, suggesting that
β-CATENIN/HNF4A/FOXA1/GATA4 signaling pathway
might be involved in this conversion process. In addition,
we found that CYCLIN A2, CYCLIN E1 and CDK2
expression was upregulated in mature hepatocytes compared
to human SSCs, hepatic stem cells and small hepatocytes,
suggesting that these cell cycle proteins may be involved in
the maturation of hepatocytes. Together, these findings shed
a novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cell
reprogramming and human liver development. Recently, it
has been shown that wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1
(Wip1) plays an important role in liver regeneration [42,
43]. Nevertheless, our data indicated that the expression
of P53 and P21 were not changed during the conversion
of human SSCs to mature hepatocytes, suggesting that
P53 and P21 are not involved in this transdifferentiation
process.

Review Committee of Ren Ji Hospital (license number of
ethic approval: 2012–01), Shanghai Jiao Tong University
School of Medicine, and an informed consent of testicular
tissues for research only was obtained from all subjects.
All experiments were performed in accordance with
relevant guidelines and regulation of the Institutional
Ethical Review Committee of Ren Ji Hospital.

Isolation of human spermatogonial stem cells
(SSCs)
Testicular tissues from OA patients were washed
exclusively in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
(Gibco) with antibiotics containing penicillin and
streptomycin (Gibco) to remove potential contamination
of Leydig cells and myoid cells. Human SSCs were
isolated using a two-step enzymatic digestion and MACS
according to procedure as previously described [20].
Briefly, human seminiferous tubules were isolated from
testicular tissues by the first enzymatic digestion utilizing
2 mg/ml collagenase IV (Gibco) and 1 µg/µl DNase I
(Gibco) in 34°C water bath for 10–15 min. Male germ
cells were further isolated from seminiferous tubules using
a second enzymatic digestion with 4 mg/ml collagenase
IV, 2.5 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma), 2 mg/ml trypsin
(Sigma), and 1 μg/μl DNase I for 15 min and followed
by differential plating [20]. For differential plating, cell
mixture suspension was seeded into in 10-cm diameter
tissue culture dishes in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) and 103 units/ml
leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Sigma) and incubated
at 34°C in 5% CO2 for 12 hours. When Sertoli cells
attached to the dishes, human male germ cells remained
in suspension and they were collected by centrifuging
at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Human male germ cells were
incubated with GPR125 (Abcam) at 4°C overnight. After
washes with BSA-EDTA-PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
buffer, the cells were suspended in 80 μl upon buffer
supplemented with 20 μl goat anti-rabbit IgG magnetic
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and they were incubated
at 4°C for less than 20 min. After incubation, 400 μl of
BSA-EDTA-PBS buffer were added to the cells to get a
final volume of 500 microliters. The cell suspension was
loaded on the column, and GPR125-negative cells were
first collected. The column was removed from the magnet,
and GPR125-positive human SSCs were collected through
washing with BSA-EDTA-PBS buffer.

CONCLUSION
In summary, we have for the first time demonstrated
that human SSCs can directly transdifferentiate into hepatic
stem cells that are capable of differentiating into the cells
with morphology, phenotype and functional attributes of
mature hepatocytes. Significantly, our ability of generating
mature and functional human hepatocytes from patients’
own SSCs could avoid immunological rejection. This
study thus provides a novel strategy to generate mature and
functional human hepatocytes for cell therapies for liver
diseases and drug toxicology screening and offers new
signaling pathways underlying the development of human
liver and cell reprogramming.

RNA extraction and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

human SSCs were cultured at a density of 1,000 cells/well
in 24-well plates with DMEM/F12 containing 10%
KSR, 100 ng/ml Activin A (Peprotech, Rocky Hills, NJ),
50 ng/ml Wnt3a (R & D System), and 20 ng/ml bFGF
(Peprotech). The conditioned medium was changed every
2 days. After 10 days of induction, this media was replaced
with HCM plus EGF supplement (BD Bioscience,
Bedford, MA) and 20 ng/ml hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF, Peprotech) for 5–10 days. Finally, the resultant
cells were cultivated in HCM supplemented with 10 ng/ml
HGF, 10 ng/ml oncostain M (OSM, Peprotech), and 10-4
mM dexamethasone (Dex, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
for another 10 days.

Total RNA was extracted from primary human SSCs,
the transdifferentiated cells, and the fully differentiated
cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Reverse transcription (RT) of total RNA was
performed using First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Thermo Scientific), and PCR was performed according to
the protocol described previously [45]. The primer pairs
of selected genes, including GPR125, UCHL1, GFRA1,
PLZF, MAGEA4, RET, VASA, cytokeratin 8 (CK8), CK18,
CK7, CK19, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF4A), albumin
(ALB), forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), GATA binding protein 4
(GATA4), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), b-CATENIN, tyrosine

antiproteinase (AAT), tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO),
cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 2
(CYP1A2), CYP3A4, CYP7A1, CYCLIN A2, CYCLIN
B1, CYCLIN D1, CYCLIN E1, CDK1, CDK2, P21, P53,
and GAPDH were designed and listed in Table 1. The
PCR reaction started at 95°C for 5 min and followed by
35 cycles: denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing
at specific temperatures (Tm) as indicated in Table 1
for 45 sec, elongation at 72°C for 45 sec, and finally
extension at 72°C for additional 10 min. The amplified
products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose
gels, and images were captured by chemiluminescence
(Chemi-Doc XRS, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry was performed to determine
the identity of GPR125-positive cells and GPR125negative cells by MACS, and the cells derived from human
SSCs induced by the conditioned medium pursuant to
the procedure described previously [44]. Briefly, cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in
0.4% triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room
temperature. After extensive washes with PBS, cells were
blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich)
for 1 hour and incubated with primary antibodies at a
dilution with 1:100 overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies
used in this study were as follows: UCHL1 (AbD Serotec),
PLZF (Abcam), GFRA1 (Santa Cruz), GPR125 (Abcam),
VASA (Abcam), CK8 (Santa Cruz), CK18 (Santa Cruz),
CK19 (R & D System), AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) (Santa
Cruz), ALB (albumin) (Santa Cruz), TRA1-60 (Chemicon),
TRA1-81 (Chemicon), SSEA3 (Chemicon), AAT (alpha-1
antiproteinase) (Bethyl), CYP1A2 (Santa Cruz), and
β-CATENIN (Santa Cruz). After three washes in PBS, the
cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated or rhodamineconjugated IgG secondary antibodies at a 1:200 dilution for
45 min at 34°C. DAPI (4′ -6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
was used to stain cell nuclei, and the cells were observed
for epifluorescence using fluorescence microscope (Nikon
Eclipse Ti-S, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Immunocytochemical staining was also conducted
to detect MAGEA4 expression in the freshly isolated
cells pursuant to the DAB kit (Gen Tech). After
permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100, the cells
were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench
endogenous peroxidase activity. Cells were blocked in
2% BSA for 30 min and incubated with an antibody to
MAGEA4 at a dilution with 1:50 overnight at 4°C. After
three times of washes in PBS, the cells were incubated
with horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 hour at room temperature and followed by
DAB (3, 3-diaminobenzidine) as a substrate. After
immunostaining, cells were counterstained with
hematoxylin and observed under a light microscope
(Nikon Eclipse Ti-S, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry analysis was carried out on hepatic
stem cells derived from human SSCs as described
previously [46]. The cells were incubated with primary
antibodies against CK18 (Santa Cruz) and CK19
(R & D System) and followed by FITC-conjugated
and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. After
extensive washes, the cells were analyzed by Accuri C6
flow cytometer (Accuri Cytometers, Ann Arbor, MI)
and Cflow software (Accuri Cytometers). Human SSCsderived cells without primary antibodies but with FITCcoupled and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies
served as a negative control.

Albumin synthesis of hepatocytes derived from
human SSCs by enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA)
Albumin synthesis of the cells derived from human
SSCs was evaluated by ELISA. In brief, culture medium
from human primary SSCs, mature hepatocytes derived
from human SSCs, and human hepatocyte line L02
cells was collected every 2 days and stored at −80°C.
The medium supernatant was concentrated with 30 kDa
ultra filter units (Millipore), and ELISA assay was

Urea assay of hepatocytes derived from human
SSCs

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We thank Professor Giulio C. Spagnoli, University
Hospital of Basel, Switzerland, for providing the antibody
to MAGEA4.

The urea nitrogen production was evaluated as
described previously [26]. The cells were cultured in
medium containing 2 mM ammonium chloride (SigmaAldrich) for 24 hours. Thereafter, the medium from human
primary SSCs, mature hepatocytes derived from human
SSCs, and human hepatocyte line L02 cells was collected,
and urea nitrogen concentration was measured using Urea
Assay Kit (Biovision, Mountain View, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The urea production
was normalized to per 105 cells. Fresh culture medium
supplemented with 2 mM ammonium chloride was used
as a negative control.
