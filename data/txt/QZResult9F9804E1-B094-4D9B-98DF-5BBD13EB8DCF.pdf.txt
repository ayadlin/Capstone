Inhibition of AraC-Induced Apoptosis

Abstract
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) used to treat human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells induces features
of normal monocytes, but the mechanisms underlying this response are not fully understood. We hypothesized
that one or more microRNAs (miRNA) known to control mouse hematopoiesis and lineage commitment might
contribute to the ability of 1,25D to control the malignant phenotype. Here we report that 1,25D markedly
induces expression of miR-32 in human myeloid leukemia cells, in which it targets the 30 -untranslated region of
the mRNA encoding the proapoptotic factor Bim to reduce its expression. RNAi-mediated suppression of the
miRNA-processing enzymes Drosha and Dicer increased Bim levels, in support of the concept that Bim is under
miRNA control in AML cells. Antisense-mediated suppression of miR-32 was sufficient to upregulate Bim
expression in AML cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of miR-32 downregulated Bim expression and increased
the differentiation response to 1,25D treatment in a manner that was associated with increased cell survival. The
positive effects of miR-32 on cell survival were confirmed by evidence of increased cell death in AML cells
preexposed to antisense miR-32 before treatment with arabinocytosine, a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat
human AML. Together, our findings indicate that miR-32 blockade is sufficient to elevate Bim expression and
sensitize AML cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Thus, agents which can inhibit miR-32 expression may
offer clinical utility by enhancing therapeutic efficacy in human AML. Cancer Res; 71(19); 6230–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic disease
characterized by blocks at various stages of hematopoietic
differentiation, which lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation
and accumulation of immature myeloid cells in bone marrow
and the peripheral blood. The disease has extremely poor
prognosis, even with the available treatment regimens, which
currently are based on the eradication of the malignant stem
and myeloid precursor cells (blasts) by cytotoxic agents such
as arabinocytosine (AraC). Unfortunately, toxicity of these
drugs to the patients limits their dosage, and recurrences
of the disease are frequent (1). Thus, effective other treatment
modalities are urgently needed.
The differentiation blocks responsible for the disease can be
overcome in cultured AML cells by supraphysiologic concentrations of the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin

D3 (1,25D; refs. 2–4). The rationale for the ability of 1,25D to
achieve this effect has been presented as due to an elevation of
the levels of transcription factors (TF), for example, jun/AP1
and C/EBP beta, which permit the blasts to bypass the barrier
presented by the leukemia-causing mutations, frequently by a
switch from myeloid to monocytic differentiation lineage
induced by these TFs (5–9). However, although all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) has been successfully used in the clinic,
induction of differentiation of AML blasts by 1,25D has so far
not resulted in notable clinical success. The reasons for this
may include the fact that in addition to prodifferentiation
activity, ATRA also promotes cell death and is particularly
effective when combined with arsenic trioxide, a toxic agent
(10, 11). Similarly, increased cytotoxicity is seen when, following AraC exposure, 1,25D is added to cultured AML cells (12,
13). It seems reasonable, therefore, to explore whether changes
in cell survival mechanisms that accompany 1,25D-induced
differentiation can be modified to increase the therapeutic
potential of 1,25D.
Using a miRNA microarray platform, we observed that miR32 was the most highly elevated miRNA in human leukemia 60
(HL60) cells treated with 1,25D. One of the predicted targets of
miR-32 lies in the 30 -untranslated region (UTR) of BCL2L11
gene, which encodes the proapoptotic protein Bim (14, 15).
Therefore, we investigated whether the increased levels of
miR-32 in 1,25D-treated AML cells can be validated by
quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), and if so, whether
miR-32 regulates the expression of Bim, and whether this is

in a list of network-eligible genes associated with the apoptosis signaling pathway.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
HL60-G cells, derived from a patient with promyeloblastic
leukemia (16), and U937 cells, obtained from American Type
Culture Collection were cultured in suspension in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone) in
a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 C. For U937
cells concentration of 1,25D routinely used was 10 nmol/L, as
these cells are less sensitive to 1,25D than HL60 cells, which were
treated with 1 nmol/L 1,25D. Cells were passaged 2 to 3 times a
week and were used in the exponential growth phase. Cells were
routinely tested for Mycoplasma by selective culture techniques.
For all experiments the cells were resuspended in fresh medium,
and each experiment was repeated at least 3 times.
Isolation of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood
and selection of monocytes
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 5 healthy
volunteers according to Institutional Review Board protocol.
Mononuclear cells were isolated by using Histopaque-1077
(Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described (17). Monocytes were
positively selected with CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec
Inc.) as directed by manufacturer's protocol. Homogeneity of
CD14-positive cells was determined by using EPICS XL flow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter).
Chemicals and antibodies
1,25D was a kind gift from Dr. Milan Uskokovic (Bioxell).
Antisense oligonucleotides against Drosha (Cat#L-016996-00)
and Dicer (Cat#L-003483-00) were obtained from Thermo
Scientific, hsa–miR-32 anti–miR miRNA inhibitor (ID:
AM12716) and hsa–miR-32 pre-miR miRNA precursor (ID:
PM12716) were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Complete
protease inhibitor cocktail was purchased from Hoffmann-La
Roche. Antibodies were procured from Cell Signaling Technologies [Bim, Bax, secondary anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse
linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)] and from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Crk-L and Calregulin).
MicroRNA target predictions and pathway analysis
Public web-based prediction sites under miRbase were used
to identify miRNA 32 target binding sites in the 30 -UTR of
human gene transcripts (18). miRBase currently links miRNA32 to targets predicted by microcosm Targets (19), microRNA.
org (20), TargetScan (21), and Pictar-Vert (22), and aims to
provide a more extensive target prediction aggregation service
in the future. In addition, other target prediction online softwares (DIANA-microT, miRanda, and PITA) were used. Targets of miRNAs which were differentially and significantly
(>1.5-fold change and P < 0.05) expressed by 1,25D were
subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity Systems) done by uploading specific miRNA lists into miRNA
array analysis program. The list of gene targets of miRNAs
predicted by IPA was filtered to remove duplicates and genes

Transfection of siRNA against Drosha and Dicer, of
antisense oligonucleotides against miR-32, and of
miR-32 precursor
This was carried out using Endo-Porter delivery reagent
from Gene Tools Inc. Si-Drosha, si-Dicer (Thermo Scientific),
anti–miR-32 inhibitor (a chemically modified, single-stranded
nucleic acid designed to specifically bind to and inhibit
endogenous miRNA molecules), pre–miR-32 (Ambion) and
appropriate nontargeting control oligonucleotides were transfected at a final concentration of 20 nmol/L for 48 hours before
exposure to other compounds.
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted by using Trizol (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer's protocol and reverse transcribed
for quantification by TaqMan microRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (23).
Mature miRNAs were quantitated using 2-step TaqMan RTPCR with TaqMan microRNA kit. MiR-32 expression level was
normalized using U6 rRNA as an internal control (Applied
Biosystems).
qRT-PCR for Bim was carried out using a FastStart DNA
SYBR Green PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) as described before
(23). Fold changes of mRNA levels in target gene relative to the
RNA polymerase II (RPII) control were calculated by relative
quantification analysis. Primers used for Bim were as follows:
upstream 50 -AGTTCTGAGTGTGACCGAGAAGGT-30 , downstream 50 -TCCTGTCTTGTGGCTCTGTCTGT A-30 ; for RP II,
upstream 50 -GCACCACGTCCAATGACAT-30 , downstream 50 GTGCGG CTGCTTCCATAA-30 . The quality of PCR products
were monitored using post-PCR melting curve analysis.
Markers of monocytic differentiation
Aliquots of 1  106 cells were harvested, washed twice with
PBS and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature with
0.5 mL MY4-RD-1 and 0.5 mL MO1-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) antibodies (Beckman Coulter Inc.,) to analyze the
expression of monocytic differentiation surface markers CD14
and CD11b, respectively. The cells were then washed 3 times
with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 1 mL PBS, and analyzed
using EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Isotypic
mouse IgG1 was used to set threshold parameters.
Cell-cycle distribution
The DNA content of the cells was determined as follows: 1 
106 cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS, then fixed
with 75% ethanol at 20 C for 24 hours. Cells were then
collected and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS with 10 mg/mL
RNase (Sigma) and 10 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) for
30 minutes at 37 C. PI-stained cells were analyzed using EPICS
XL flow cytometer. The resultant distribution of DNA content
was gated and analyzed using the multicycle program to
determine the proportion of cells in the sub-G1/G0 fraction,
which represents the nonviable cells.

Western blotting
Western blotting was done using whole-cell extracts as
described before (23). Briefly, membranes were incubated
overnight with different primary antibodies and then blotted
with a HRP-linked secondary antibodies for 1 hour. The

assay system (Pierce Biotechnology), each membrane was
stripped and reprobed for internal control (Crk-L or calregulin). The optical density of each band was quantitated using
ImageQuant 5.0 (Molecular Dynamics).

Each experiment was conducted at least 3 times. The
results were expressed relative to vehicle controls, or as
percentages of the cell population (mean  SE). Significance of the differences between mean values was assessed
by a 2-tailed Student's t test. All computations were done
with an IBM-compatible personal computer using Microsoft
EXCEL.

Results
Upregulation of miR-32 by 1,25D in HL60 and U937 cells
The initial experiments were conducted using a miRNA
microarray platform (24) to identify the expression of miRNAs
after exposure to 1,25D. IPA indicated that only miR-32 was
differentially expressed in both HL60 and U937 1,25D-treated
cells. As shown in Figure 1A, miR-32 was markedly (11-fold)
and highly significantly increased in HL60 cells, but the increase
was less marked and below the level of statistical significance in
U937 cells. However, validation of these results by quantitative
real-time PCR, shown in Figure 1B, showed that although the
increase in miR-32 level was less marked in U937 than in HL60
cells, the increase was statistically significant in both cell lines.
Although TaqMan results were less dramatic than those
obtained by the microarray, they were clearly confirmatory.
Treatment with 1,25D of monocytes isolated from healthy
volunteers also significantly (P < 0.01) increased miR-32 levels.
The proapoptotic protein Bim is a potential target of
miR-32 in AML cells
In silico studies reported in at least 6 public searches
(Fig. 2A) revealed that 30 -UTR of BCL2L11 gene, which encodes
the proapoptotic protein Bim (14, 15), has a potential miR-32
binding site at chromosome 2q13, which is conserved between
human and murine genomes (Fig. 2B). Direct regulation in
AML cells of Bim protein expression by miR-32 was suggested
by the marked decrease in Bim mRNA and Bim protein, its
largest isoform known as Bim-EL (15), in both HL60 and U937
cells after exposure to 1,25D (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with
the report that in human prostate cancer cells LNCaP, a
luciferase reporter construct containing BCL2L11 30 -UTR with

inhibition by miR-32 (25). Although cell type–restricted specificity of miRNA targets is well known, this suggests that Bim
may be a general target of miR-32 in human cells.
Expression of Bim is regulated by miRNAs
To confirm that the above predictions apply to AML cells, we
first tested whether an interference with miRNA processing
affects Bim protein expression in these cells. To accomplish this
we reduced the levels of the RNases which process miRNA
precursors, the RNase III Drosha, which processes miRNAs in
the nucleus, and the cytosolic RNase III, Dicer (26–29). As
shown in Figure 3A, transfection of silencing constructs of

lation of miR-32 expression, though the ambient levels of
miR-32 transcripts were not sufficiently reduced to detect
statistical significance. As expected, the changes in Bim protein
levels were reciprocally affected by the reduction in miRNAprocessing enzymes, with decreased Bim levels noted after
1,25D exposure, which were abrogated and actually increased
by Dicer and Drosha (Fig. 3B). The increase in Bim levels
when miRNA processing is reduced corroborates that Bim
expression is regulated by a miRNA or several miRNAs.

the cellular levels of endogenous miR-32 (Fig. 4A, bars 3–4)

miR-32 in AML cells, and that 1,25D-induced downregulation
of Bim can be reversed by anti–miR-32. In contrast, the levels
of Bax, another proapoptotic protein, are essentially unaltered
by the manipulation of miR-32 cellular levels (Fig. 4C and D).

Precursor miR-32 promotes 1,25D-induced AML cell
differentiation, whereas antisense miR-32 inhibits
differentiation
It has been observed that the processes associated with cell
maturation and acquisition of function include cell increased
cell survival capacity (30–32). We therefore determined the
effect on 1,25D-induced differentiation of the modulation of
cellular miR-32 levels by anti–miR-32 or pre–miR-32 and
found that anti–miR-32 inhibited cell differentiation
(Fig. 5A), whereas pre–miR-32 enhanced differentiation
(Fig. 5B). Thus, the changes in the expression of cell surface
markers of the monocytic phenotype CD11b and CD14 (Fig. 5)
paralleled the cellular levels of miR-32 shown in Figure 4A. The
enhancement of monocytic differentiation by pre–miR-32 was
also shown by the increased expression of the cytoplasmic
esterase NSE, another marker of monocytic phenotype (data

www.aacrjournals.org

not shown). Thus, perhaps indirectly, miR-32 has a minor but
clear role in monocytic differentiation.
Inhibition of miR-32 expression by anti–miR-32
increases the toxicity of AraC to AML cells
The observed effects of miR-32 on the expression of Bim
protein suggest that a reduction of cellular levels of miR-32
should make AML cells more susceptible to the therapeutic
agents used to treat this disease, generally AraC. This was
tested by preincubating AML cells for 48 hours with anti–miR32, then treating the cells with 100 mmol/L AraC for 24 hours,
and determining Trypan Blue permeability, an indication of
necrosis, and the estimation of apoptosis by Annexin V, as well
as by the sub G1/G0 fraction obtained from flow cytometric
measurement of cell-cycle distribution. All 3 sets of determinations showed that anti–miR-32 increases cell death induced

by AraC (Table 1, groups 3 and 4, 7, and 8) and abrogates the
previously reported antiapoptotic effect of 1,25D (31). The
protective effect of 1,25D is seen here for HL60 cells (Table 1,
group 1 vs. group 2), although the complexity of the transfection system does not make this apparent in U937 cells.
Anti–miR-32 also enhanced apoptosis when doxorubicin or
daunomycin were used as the toxic agents (data not shown).
The complementary approach, the use of pre–miR-32, to
show the protective effect of miR-32 on AML cell survival,
confirmed the protective effect (Table 1). In the experiments
in which pre–miR-32 was transfected the changes in cell
survival were less marked than those obtained with anti–
miR-32, with AraC-induced necrosis not being significantly
affected, and only early apoptosis detectable in U937 cells
not treated with 1,25D (Table 1, group 15). This is perhaps
seen because other components of cell survival network play
a greater role than Bim when pre–miR-32 reduces Bim levels,
although increased Bim levels in cells treated with anti–miR-

32 have a more dominant effect on cell survival. Taken
together, the 2 approaches clearly show that the response
of AML cells to therapeutic cytotoxic agents may be increased by lowering cellular miR-32 levels. This raises the
possibility that the combination of differentiation (by 1,25D)
with cytotoxic (AraC) therapy may be further enhanced by
agents or conditions which lower cellular miR-32 levels, such
as anti–miR-32.

Discussion
The studies reported here provide several mechanistic
insights and may also have a translational significance. They
reveal a novel aspect of the mechanism of vitamin D action,
have a bearing on the specificity of miRNA targets, and
enhance the understanding of AML cell survival mechanisms.
The latter may point the way to increasing the effectiveness of
AraC-based induction of disease-free patient survival.

NOTE: Inhibition of miR-32 expression by antisense oligonucleotides increases the toxicity of AraC to HL60 and U937 cells. HL60 and
U937 cells were transfected with 20 nmol/L antisense oligonucleotides against miR-32 for 48 hours and then exposed to 1 nmol/L
(HL60) or 10 nmol/L (U937) 1,25D for further 48 hours. Then the cells were exposed to 100 mmol/L AraC for further 24 hours. To detect
apoptosis, cells were stained using 50 mg/mL Annexin V and 20 mg/mL PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. Annexin V–positive/PInegative cells were considered as early apoptotic, cells doubly positive, as late apoptotic. Bold type shows the statistically significant
differences from the corresponding scrambled controls. P < 0.05; mean values  SD are shown, n ¼ 4. C, vehicle control; D, 1,25Dtreated; A, anti–miR-32; P, pre–miR-32; Apts, apoptosis.

Previous work in our and other laboratories has shown
that 1,25D-induced differentiation of human AML cells is
accompanied by increased cell survival capacity, which is
likely to be multifactorial. These include activation of the
ERK, an AKT pathways (33–36), although the specific details
about the sequence of molecular events are few. One possibility is that the hKSR2 gene, which is directly upregulated
by 1,25D (37), provides an upstream platform for activation
of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which then
signal prosurvival events, as has been shown by knockdown
of hKSR2 expression (31). The prosurvival events include
upregulation of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 (30) and altered Bcl2/Bad ratios (31). Here, we document a role for miR-32 in the
prosurvival events, but its relationship to the other signaling
members of apoptosis/survival network remains to be
elucidated.
The exquisite cell context specificity of miRNA targets is well
known, and any given mRNA may be targeted by different
miRNAs in different cell types or even cell subtypes. (e.g., refs.
38, 39). It is therefore important to note that in both HL60 and
U937 cells, which belong to different FAB subtypes, miR-32
targets Bim (Fig. 4). Also, recent studies in the Croce laboratory
have shown that in 2 subtypes of cultured human prostate
cancer cells, miR-32 inhibits the expression of Bim by a

www.aacrjournals.org

30 -UTR–mediated mechanism (25). Taken together with results
reported here, this suggests that the miR-32–Bim relationship
is of wide significance in human cells. This contrasts with the
targeting of p27Kip1 by miR-181 previously reported in AML
cells (23, 40), whereas in a variety of solid tumors p27Kip1 is
targeted by miR-221/222 (41–43). These examples show that
miRNA targets need to be established 1 cell type at a time.
Currently, there are only a few published reports of the
ability of 1,25D to regulate key cellular functions through
modulation of miRNA expression. Previously, we showed that
an exposure of human AML HL60 and U937 cells to 1,25D
results in downregulation of the miR-181 family, with the most
prominent effect on miR-181a (23). This was associated with
the upregulation of p27Kip1 expression and contributed to
1,25D-induced cell-cycle arrest. More recently, miR-24 was
reported to be upregulated by 1,25D and related to diminished
cell proliferation (44), and a role for miRNA in cell-cycle
control by 1,25D was described in cultured nonmalignant
RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial cells (45). In RWPE-1 cells
1,25D upregulates the DNA helicase MCM7 gene, in which the
miR-106 is embedded in intron 13 (46, 47), which then targets
p21/CDKN1A and contributes to cell-cycle arrest. Thus, this
article provides a new aspect of the accumulating evidence
that miRNAs participate in the critical aspects of vitamin D

regulation of the essential cellular processes, such as those
controlling the cell cycle, cell survival, and cell differentiation.
Selective upregulation of miR-32 in at least some human
cancers, including prostate carcinoma and multiple myeloma,
(25, 48) seems to play a role in malignant transformation by
providing survival advantage to cells with high expression of
miR-32 and reduced levels of Bim. A similar mechanism
described here seems to aid the phagocytic function of
monocytes, which produces intracellular stress as a consequence of generation of ROS needed to dispose of phagocytized material. But because increased survival capacity is a
disadvantage when malignant cells are to be eradicated by
cytotoxic agents, consideration should be given to the design
of differentiation therapy regimens in which compounds or
conditions which reduce the expression of miR-32, or increase

the levels of Bim (49, 50), are administered along with the
therapeutic agents.
