ABSTRACT
Background and aim: High levels of peripheral plasma fibrinogen have recently
been revealed that related to poor clinical prognosis in various types of malignant
tumors. The purpose of this research was to identify the prognostic significance of the
preoperative peripheral serum fibrinogen level in patients with penile cell carcinoma.
Methods: This retrospective research included 72 penile cancer patients with date
about their serum fibrinogen value before surgery who undergone either partial or
radical penectomy at The 2nd Hospital of Tianjin Medical University between January
2002 to January 2012. They had a mean follow-up of 30.8 months. To determine
the factors that were significant in predicting a patient’s prognosis, univariate and
multivariate analyses were performed according to the Cox proportional hazards
regression model.
Results: The 5-year cancer specific survival (CSS) rate was 62.4% of patients
with preoperative fibrinogen levels below 340 mg/dl and 41.9% for those with higher
levels (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the pathological T stage (p <
0.001), tumor grade (p = 0.036), postoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.041), nodal
metastasis(p < 0.001), pathological type (p < 0.001) and fibrinogen (p = 0.023)
were independent prognostic factors for survival. Patients with low fibrinogen level
(<340mg/dl) had significantly longer CSS and the different survival rate were defined
using the log-rank test.
Conclusions: The high preoperative peripheral serum fibrinogen level was
related to poor survival in penile cancer patients. Fibrinogen may serve as a powerful
predictor of CSS in penile cancer patients.

it is higher in Uganda [2]. The main prognostic factor of
the penis is the extent of inguinal lymph node involvement
[3]. There are no classical molecular biomarkers for
clinical practice value of the penis until today. The soluble
eptithelial antigen of penile tumor is short of sensitivity in
the diagnosis of small size tumor and has poor prognostic
significance for survival following operation [4]. The

Penile cancer is a rare but ominous disease,
accounting for 0 ~1% of all malignancies in men. Penile
cancer is estimated 2,030 new cancer cases and 340 deaths
in United States of 2016 [1] .It is relatively common in
the Asia than Europe. According to poor hygiene and
economic conditions, its incidence can reach 10% of all

Lots of articles revealed that an interrelation
exists between haemostatic factors and tumor biological
behavior. The hypercoagulable state is considered to be
correlative with malignancy that it has been showed a
high proportion of 50% in patient with tumor. Fibrinogen,
a 340-kDa glycoprotein that is synthesized in liver and
is transformed into fibrin through the effect of activated
thrombin, play an important role as a coagulation factor.
An enormous number of procoagulant and ﬁbrinolytic
factors were discovered to be overexpressed in malignant
tumors. Plasma ﬁbrinogen as one member of these factors
was involved in. Recent studies have revealed that elevated
preoperative plasma ﬁbrinogen levels are related to poor
outcome in various types of malignancies; however, the
clinical and prognostic value of preoperative plasma
fibrinogen levels in patients with operable penile tumor
has not yet been reported. The object of this retrospective
research was to define the impact of fibrinogen levels at
diagnosis on the prognosis of patient with penile cancer.
To our knowledge we present the ﬁrst comprehensive
study of the prognostic role of preoperative fibrinogen for
CSS.

tumor subtype was defined in the light of the 2010 UICC
Classification. The histologic tumor grade is according
to the classiﬁcation by Broders. Patients who received
perioperative chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy were
excluded. Our hospital and institute databases were used
to obtain patient and tumor information, such as age,
sex, TNM stage, regional lymph node involvement or
distant metastasis, tumor histological subtype, fibrinogen
value, tumor grade, and body mass index (BMI). Table
1 reveals the clinicopathological characteristics of the
patients recruited in this study. Every included patient
was followed up every 2-6 months thereafter to leave the
hospital. All the patients signed informed consent about
the use and publication of their date prior to operation.
This research was affirmed by the ethics committee of the
institution. All the blood samplings were got from less
than 3 days in advance of operated patients. For assaying
ﬁbrinogen, we used the Clauss mode that is in view of
the thrombin clotting time according to Datafai Fibrinogen
and a CA7000 analyzer made in Japan (Sysmex Cooperation).

Statistical analysis
To evaluate the connection between the pretherapeutic plasma fibrinogen level and clinicopathological
factors, the Student’s t-test was performed to acquire mean
values with standard deviation (SD), whereas the MannWhitney U-test and chi-squared test were performed
for categorized data and qualitative data, respectively.
We selected 340 mg/dl as an optimal threshold value
of fibrinogen according to a calculation using receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis. To determine
the factors that were significant in predicting a patient’s
prognosis, a method of multivariate analysis was
performed in the light of the Cox proportional hazards
regression model. And just the variables revealed to be

were associated with worse CSS. And the elevated
fibrinogen value was also proved to be a prognostic factor
of poor CSS according to the cut-off level. However, a
fibrinogen cut-off of 340 mg/dl using ROC analysis was
choose to be optimal in order to achieve higher prognostic
accuracy (Figure 1). Accordingly, fibrinogen≥ 340 mg/dl
with a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.97 (95% CI 1.84-22.97, p <
0.001) than the patient with fibrinogen < 340 mg/dl. The
5-year survival rate of all patients included (n = 72) was
62.4% for fibrinogen < 340 mg/dl(n = 41) and 41.9% for
fibrinogen ≥340 mg/dl (n = 31, p = 0.023, log rank)(Figure
2).
Multivariate regression analysis showed that the
regional lymph node involvement or distant metastasis,
tumor stage, tumor histological subtype, tumor grade,
postoperative Chemotherapy were identified as significant
and independent predict markers of CSS in penile cancer
patient (Table 1, Figures 3-7). In contrast, smoking was not
up to reach statistical significance. And these significance
did not change when adopted step-wise backward LRregression method analyses. However, focusing on the
hyperﬁbrinogenemia of patients with fibrinogen≥340mg/
dl, was defined as poor clinical outcome predictor in
penile tumor patients.

statistically significant through univariate analysis (p <

survival rates were defined using the log-rank test. The
statistical analysis was performed by SPSS version
20.0 for Microsoft windows. All reported p values were
2-sided, and a p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

DISCUSSION

positive feedback cascade may blow up the activity of
cancer cells and fibrinogen. While ﬁbrinogen constantly
present a role in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis
through accelerating tumor neovascularization and
according to accelerate the long-range adhesion of tumor
cells [26, 27], the state of preoperative peripheral serum
fibrinogen may reﬂect the progressive and metastatic
possibility of tumors. On the other hand, ﬁbrinogen and
platelets participate in protecting cancer cells from natural
killer cytotoxicity [28]. However, fibrinogen fragment is
revealed to inhibit angiogenesis and consequently tumor
progression by binding to and suppressing the function of
integrins expressed on endothelial cells [18, 29, 30]. The
effect of fibrinogen in cancer progression is also deemed
to be disputed.
Lots of clinical articles have revealed that high
preoperative peripheral plasma ﬁbrinogen levels are
associated with poor overall survival outcome and diseasefree survival in various malignances. C. Perisanidis
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to
assess the prognostic effect of peripheral ﬁbrinogen in
solid tumors, showing that pretreatment plasma ﬁbrinogen
represents a biomarker of worse survival in tumor patients
[31, 32]. However, the prognostic effect of preoperative
peripheral serum fibrinogen level in penile cell carcinoma
patients has not been elevated. Compared with all the
results, high peripheral plasma fibrinogen levels were
linked to disease CSS in penile cancer patients, and
pretreatment peripheral plasma f﻿﻿ibrinogen levels may be
also an independent predictor for survival in operable
penile cancer patients.
We were conscious of the shortages of a
retrospective research that includes relatively less cases,
and that the optimal cut off value of plasma fibrinogen was
not defined. Prospective articles with a large population
are warranted to define the accurate prognostic effect
of pretherapeutic peripheral plasma fibrinogen levels
in penile cancer patients. Moreover, systematic review
of relative important others prognostic makers such as
HPV or foreskin status, microscopic lymph vascular and
perineural invasion, growth pattern were not included.
Others, all potentially prognostic factors involved in the
analysis were assessable in 72 patients, conducted in
only one center with a small sample that it will not be
generalized. All above potential limitations should be
taken into account when we try to interpret the results.

In the present research, it observed the clinical and
prognostic significance between preoperative plasma
fibrinogen levels and penile cancer. In the univariate
analysis, smoke, tumor stage, tumor grade, postoperative
chemotherapy, nodal metastasis, pathological type and
peripheral plasma fibrinogen levels were associated with
CSS. Multivariate survival analyses showed that nodal
metastasis, tumor stage, pathological type, tumor grade,
postoperative chemotherapy and preoperative plasma
fibrinogen levels are significant independent prognostic
markers for worse CSS in penile cancer patients As the
traditional clinicopathological prognostic factors, such
as diameter and number of the primary tumor, lymph
node metastasis, perineural invasion , chemotherapy and
pathological type have been generally used to predict
survival for patient with malignant solid tumor. Vincenzo
Ficarra et al. and Muneer, A. et al. reviewed the reported
data concerning the prognostic markers in patients
with penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) including
tumor histologic grade, tumor histologic subtype, tumor
pathologic extension and lymphatic and/or venous
embolization, metastasis in regional lymph nodes, tumor
growth pattern,p53, E-cadherin, MMP-2, and MMP-9 [5,
6]. Thereby, we summarize the molecular mechanisms
about the connection between high levels of peripheral
plasma fibrinogen and poor survival outcome of penile
cancer patient.
Fibrinogen, as a major plasma protein, plays highly
important roles in blood clotting, cellular and matrix
interactions, and inflammation [7, 8]. Fibrinogen converted
to insoluble ﬁbrin by activated thrombin signiﬁcantly
affects blood clotting, ﬁbrinolysis, inﬂammatory response,
wound healing and neoplasia [9, 10]. Interleukin (IL)6, immunosuppressive hormone, corticosteroid were
reported to increase fibrinogen synthesis in the liver
[11, 12] and IL-1 paradoxically suppresses fibrinogen
production [13]. However, similar to inflammation, the
mechanism of increased fibrinogen in tumor has not been
clarified. Numerous published experimental research
articles have demonstrated that ﬁbrinogen plays a key
role in cancer progression according to inducing tumor
cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
migration, angiogenesis, hematogenous metastasis and
postoperative recurrence [14-22]. Fibrinogen releases
proliferative signals according to supplying as a scaffold
for binding growth factors, such as FGF-2 [23]and VEGF
[24]. Several growth factors binding could accelerate
cellular adhesion, proliferation and migration during
angiogenesis and cancer cell growth. Fibrinogen helps
platelets to adhere to cancer cells, and platelets, in turn,
induce more peripheral plasma fibrinogen to aggregate
around cancer cells through forming thrombin. Several
publications demonstrated the possibility that tumor
cells themselves may generate fibrinogen [23, 25]. Thus,

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our research supply proof that the
preoperative peripheral plasma ﬁbrinogen level might
be used as a new independent prognostic maker in penile
cancer patients, which revealed that elevated peripheral
plasma ﬁbrinogen levels was associated with a worse CSS
clinical result in patient. Compared to other experimental
biomarkers, although our results await further validation,
