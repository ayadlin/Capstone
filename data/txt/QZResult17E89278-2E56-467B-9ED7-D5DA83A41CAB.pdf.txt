Abstract
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling has been implicated in the resistance to hormonal therapy in breast
cancer. Using a model of postmenopausal, estrogen-dependent breast cancer, we investigated the antitumor
effects of the dual IGF-1R/InsR tyrosine kinase inhibitor BMS-754807 alone and in combination with letrozole or
tamoxifen. BMS-754807 exhibited antiproliferative effects in vitro that synergized strongly in combination with
letrozole or 4-hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant. Similarly, combined treatment of BMS-754807 with either
tamoxifen or letrozole in vivo elicited tumor regressions not achieved by single-agent therapy. Notably, hormonal
therapy enhanced the inhibition of IGF-1R/InsR without major side effects in animals. Microarray expression
analysis revealed downregulation of cell-cycle control and survival pathways and upregulation of erbB in response
to BMS-754807 plus hormonal therapy, particularly tamoxifen. Overall, these results offer a preclinical proof-ofconcept for BMS-754807 as an antitumor agent in combination with hormonal therapies in hormone-sensitive
breast cancer. Cooperative cell-cycle arrest, decreased proliferation, and enhanced promotion of apoptosis may
contribute to antitumor effects to be gauged in future clinical investigations justiﬁed by our ﬁndings. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Hormonal therapies are front-line systemic therapies for
patients with estrogen-responsive breast cancer (ERBC). The
selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen, for
instance, has shown improved survival in breast cancer
patients for more than 25 years (1). However, resistance to
therapies targeting the estrogen receptor signaling pathway
represents a major clinical hurdle (2).
Mounting data suggests that the insulin-like growth factor
(IGF) system is a major determinant in the development of
resistance to therapies targeting estrogen signaling (3). As an
estrogen-dependent gene, IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression
is modulated by estrogen signaling (4). In addition, IGF-1, by a
number of mechanisms, regulates estrogen receptor–dependent transcription (5). The combination of IGF-1 and estradiol

synergistically stimulate growth of ERBC, and cross-talk pathways between these systems have implicated the IGF-1 system
as a mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy in breast
cancer (6–9). Furthermore, the proliferative effects of IGF-1
can be attenuated by tamoxifen and cells that have been
selected to become resistant to tamoxifen have increased
responsiveness to the proliferative effects of IGF-1 (10). Recently, data has suggested that direct interactions between estrogen and IGF-1R may be important for mitogenic estrogen
receptor signaling (11).
Thus, targeting both the IGF signaling pathway and the
estrogen receptor pathway is an attractive strategy for enhancing the clinical activity of endocrine therapy, as well as preventing or delaying the development of resistance. Currently, it
is unclear whether estrogen deprivation or estrogen receptor
inhibition would have a greater antitumor effect in combination with IGF-1 blockade. This distinction becomes important
as the 2 classes of approved endocrine therapies (aromatase
inhibitors and SERMs, respectively) function by these differing
mechanisms. Preclinical data with a monoclonal antibody
(mAb) directed at the IGF-1R has shown enhancement of
tamoxifen activity in vivo (12). However, in postmenopausal
breast cancer patients, aromatase inhibitors are often used as
ﬁrst-line hormonal therapy due to superior activity over
tamoxifen (13, 14). Thus, to optimize the selection of the most
appropriate agent to investigate in combination with IGF-1
blockage, preclinical assessment of activity in an in vivo model
is necessary.
In regards to blocking IGF signaling, the majority of
current strategies aimed at blocking the IGF system focus

on the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). The IGF-1R is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is the major signaling receptor
for the IGF-1 pathway (15). The functional receptor consists
of 2 subunits (a and b) in a heterodimeric structure.
Upon activation by the mitogenic ligands IGF-1 and IGF2, the IGF-1R becomes autophosphorylated, stimulating
the activation of downstream intracellular pathways (namely, the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways) that lead to
tumor proliferation, survival, and metastasis (16). In addition, the IGF-1R half-receptor can dimerize with the
insulin receptor (InsR) tyrosine kinase, which shares a high
degree of homology to the IGF-1R. Dimerization of these
"hybrid-receptors" have different biological activity and
ligand speciﬁcity (17). In particular, the fetal or A isoform
of the InsR seems to have a more mitogenic role in cancer
cell proliferation than its purely metabolic isoform B (18).
The varying biological activities of the InsR isoforms are
likely related to their differing afﬁnities for IGF-1 system
ligands. For instance, whereas the metabolic InsR isoform
B only binds insulin at physiologic concentrations, the InsR
isoform A is able to bind and be activated by IGF-2
(17). Thus, InsR isoform A through dimerization with
IGF-1R or homodimerization may provide mitogenic
stimuli to cancer cells through activation by IGF-2. Accumulated data has implicated the InsR isoform A, or the InsR
total content, as being important in breast cancer progression and survival (19, 20). More recent data suggest it may
also be a mechanism of resistance to therapies that speciﬁcally target the IGF-1 receptor, such as mAb therapies
(21, 22). Patients with node-negative breast cancers, whose
tumors express high InsR content, have worse disease-free
survival than patients with even moderate InsR content
(19). Early studies have also shown that approximately 80%
of breast cancers have an InsR content higher than the
median content found in the normal breast, and approximately 20% of cancers show InsR over 10-fold higher than
the median value of the normal breast tissue (20). Early
studies targeting the IGF-1 receptor in patients with refractory tumors have shown that mAb therapies may induce
upregulation of insulin secretion, suggesting a compensatory mechanism which could possibly activate InsR signaling as a mechanism of resistance (23). Thus, if InsR isoform
A expression is an important mechanism of proliferation of
breast cancer cells and an important mechanism of resistance to IGF-1–targeted antibody therapy, dual kinase
inhibitors of InsR and the IGF-1R may have a therapeutic
advantage.
On the basis of these data, we conducted a preclinical
study investigating the efﬁcacy of a small molecule inhibitor
of the IGF-1R and InsR, BMS-754807, in the estrogen-dependent, aromatase-expressing breast cancer model, MCF-7/
AC-1 both with and without hormonal therapy (24, 25). Our
hypothesis was that complete IGF blockade would increase
the antitumor activity of hormonal therapy in ERBC. We
have also used this model system to evaluate the tolerability
of these treatments in vivo and carry out correlative studies
to identify potential biomarkers of antitumor activity in
response to IGF blockade.

Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against insulin Rb, ERa were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An antibody against
Ki-67 was purchased from Abcam. Horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were
purchased form Invitrogen. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells
stably transfected with the human aromatase gene were
provided by Dr. Angela Brodie and Shiuan Chen (Beckman
Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, California) as
previously reported (26). Cells authentication was done using
16 loci short-tandem repeat proﬁling at the completion of
included studies. Letrozole (Femara, CGS 20267) was kindly
provided by Dr. D. Evans (Novartis Pharma).
Cell culture
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells stably transfected with the
human aromatase gene (MCF-7/AC-1 cells) as previously
described (25) were routinely maintained in DMEM with
10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution, and 750 mg/mL
G418. The culture medium was changed twice weekly.
MTS proliferation assay
The effect of the various drugs and hormones on MCF-7/AC1 cellular growth was examined using the MTS proliferation
assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous; Promega), as previously described
(27). Brieﬂy, cells growing in regular media were transferred to
IMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (charcoal-stripped serum in medium,
CSSM) for 72 hours. This medium was used for all cell growth
assays. The cells were detached from their ﬂask using trypsin
and seeded in 96-well plates at 1.0  103/mL (100 mL) on day 0.
Twenty-four hours later, several concentrations of the hormones or drugs were added at doses indicated in the text. The
cells were incubated for 6 days in the absence and presence of
the tested drugs and hormones. At the end of the treatment, the
MTS dye reduction was assessed as per the product information label. Proliferation was calculated as a percentage of the
nondrug–treated controls. Experiments were done in at least
triplicate. To evaluate the effect of combination treatment with
BMS-754807 and tamoxifen or letrozole or fulvestrant, the
method of Chou and Talalay was used to determine synergy

as described previously (28). Median effect analysis was done
using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). Mean values of the combination index (CI) at the affected fractions of 50% (Fa50) and
75% (Fa75) are shown. A CI value signiﬁcantly less than 1
indicates synergism, a CI not signiﬁcantly different from 1
indicates addition, and a CI signiﬁcantly higher than 1 indicates antagonism.
Postmenopausal intratumoral aromatase mice
xenograft model
Female ovariectomized BALB/c athymic nude mice 4 to 6
weeks of age were obtained from Harlan Laboratories. The
animals were housed in a pathogen-free environment under
controlled conditions of light and humidity and received food
and water. All animal studies were carried out according to the
guidelines approved by the Animal Care Committee of the
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Animals were allowed to acclimatize for 48 hours after shipment before tumor inoculation
was done. For inoculation, subconﬂuent MCF-7/AC-1 cells
were suspended in Matrigel (10 mg/mL) at 2.5  107 cells/
mL. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with 100 mL of
cell suspension on each ﬂank. Tumors were measured weekly
with calipers, and volumes were calculated with the formula
4/3p x r12 x r2 (r1 < r2), in which r1 is the smaller radius.
Treatments began when the tumors reached a measurable size
(250–300 mm3). Mice randomized to treatment groups using
JMP (SAS).
Mice received subcutaneous injection with vehicle, nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor letrozole (10 mg/d) and antiestrogen
tamoxifen (500 mg/d), which were all prepared as suspensions
in 0.3% hydroxypropyl cellulose; IGF-1R/InsR inhibitor BMS754807 (50 mg/kg/d) was prepared in PEG400:water (80:20)
and was administered by daily gavage; the combinations of
letrozole, and/or tamoxifen with BMS-754807 were given at the
full doses. All treatments are given once daily for 28 days
continuously. All animal groups were supplemented with
androstenedione daily for the duration of the experiment.
After 28 days of treatment, 1 of the 2 ﬂank tumors was
surgically excised from each tumor-bearing animal. Animals
were then maintained and observed until the study endpoint
(300% tumor growth from treatment baseline), at which point
the remaining tumor was resected at the time of animal
sacriﬁce. After each resection, tumors were carefully excised
from mouse tissue with portions frozen in OCT medium
(Tissue-Tek) or placed in formalin for further analyses. Differences between the groups were analyzed by ANOVA with
multiple comparison posttests using Prism (Graph Pad).
Mouse weight and blood glucose measurements
Blood glucose levels in all mice were measured from
lateral tail vein pricks in the morning using an Ascensia
Elite XL glucose meter (Bayer) and Glucometer Elite test
strips (Fisher Scientiﬁc). One glucose measurement required
approximately 3 mL of blood. Depending on the volume of
blood that ﬂowed out by a tail vein prick, 1 or 2 glucose
measurements were taken. In the case of 2 measurements,
the average was used in the calculations. Mouse weight was
measured every other day.

Immunohistochemical staining
At autopsy, the tumors were resected and processed for
routine gross and microscopic examination. The tumor tissues
were ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedded in
parafﬁn. Serial sections (5-mm thick) were cut on a microtome
and mounted on glass slides. For histopathologic examination,
every fourth section was dewaxed in Histoclear (National
Diagnostic) and hydrated in graded alcohol solutions and
distilled water for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
examined under a light microscope.
For immunohistochemical staining, prior to use, the slides
were washed 3 times (5 minutes each) in xylene to remove
parafﬁn, 3 times (5 minutes each) with 100%, 90%, and 70%
ethanol (in that order), and hydrated in distilled water before
tissue treatment. Antigens were retrieved by treatment for 45
minutes in 0.001 mol/L sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) in a water
bath (95 C–99 C). The endogenous peroxides activity was
inhibited with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes. Nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked by incubation for 30 minutes with 2%
bovine serum albumin in PBS; specimens were washed 5 times
in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 C with different antibodies, including anti-human Ki-67 (1:500). After 5 further
washes in PBS, specimens were incubated with second antibodies (Invitrogen). Staining reaction was carried out using
HRP-mediated AEC (aminoethyl carbazole) or DAB immunostaining (Zymed Laboratories). Red or brown deposits indicted
the sites of positive immunostaining and were counterstained
with Mayer's hematoxylin solution by standard procedures.
Western blot analysis
Inhibition of IGF-1R and insulin receptor phosphorylation
and ERK/Akt pathways by BMS-754807 alone or combination
with 4-OH tamoxifen (10 mmol/L), letrozole (10 mmol/L), or
fulvestrant (100 nmol/L) were determined by Western blotting.
Brieﬂy, cells were cultured in IMEM steroid–reduced medium
without phenol red for 24 hours, then subconﬂuent MCF-7/AC1 cells were treated with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
BMS-754807 (10 mmol/L), or BMS-754807 (10 mmol/L) plus
hormones for 24 hours in serum-free conditions. For the ﬁnal
15 minutes of drug treatment, 10 nmol/L LongR3 IGF-I was
added to the medium. Lysates were then prepared and analyzed by Western blotting.
Western blotting was done as previously described (27).
Brieﬂy, proteins were extracted from the tumor tissues by
homogenization in buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
1 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and protease/phosphatase
inhibitors (1 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 10 mg/mL
aprotinin, and 1 mg/mL leupeptin). The homogenates were
centrifuged at 2,000  g for 15 minutes at 4 C. After centrifugation at 10,000  g for 5 minutes, the supernatants were
separated and their protein concentrations were measured.
The protein lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immuno-Blot polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane
(catalog no. 162-0177; Bio-Rad), and Western blot analysis was
done as described previously (27). The membranes were
blocked with 5% milk in TBS [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
and 150 mmol/L NaCl] plus 0.05% Tween-20 overnight at 4 C
and then incubated in 5% milk containing primary antibodies

overnight at 4 C. After incubation, membranes were washed 3
times (15 minutes each) with 5% milk, incubated with goat
anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP (1:5,000) in 5% milk for 1
hour at room temperature and washed 3 times (15 minutes
each) in TBS. The bands were detected using an ECL Kit
(Amersham). Densitometry was done using Genetools software (Syngene).
RNA isolation and gene expression proﬁling
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagents (Catalog no.
15596-026; Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA isolated
from tumors surgically excised from each tumor-bearing animal
after 28 days of treatment were used to generate gene expression
data using Affymetrix HT-HG-U133A GeneChip (Affymetrix)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The microarray
data were analyzed by ANOVA using Partek software to identify
genes differentially expressed between different treatment
groups. Gene expression data was analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify pathways that were up- or downregulated in response to in vivo treatments (Ingenuity Systems).
Statistical analysis
Error bars represent SEM. Differences in the mean of 2
samples were analyzed using Student unpaired t test. For
comparisons between multiple samples, ANOVA with Tukey's
multiple comparisons posttest was used. For P values, differences less than 0.001 was considered extremely signiﬁcant ( );
0.001 to 0.01 very signiﬁcant ( ); 0.01 to 0.05 signiﬁcant ( ).
P values more than 0.05 were considered not signiﬁcant (ns).

Results
MCF-7/AC-1 cells are estrogen-driven breast cancers
cells in vitro and in vivo
The MCF-7/AC-1 cells were employed in a series of experiments due to the their responsiveness to estrogen and sensi-

tivity to clinically estrogen-targeting agents, including the
SERM tamoxifen, the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, and the
pure antiestrogen, fulvestrant. To conﬁrm that the MCF-7/AC1 cells were estrogen dependent in vitro, MCF-7/AC-1 cells
were cultured in IMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped
serum, with or without the aromatase substrate androstenedione (1 nmol/L). After 6 days incubation, androstenedione
stimulated a 4-fold growth in MCF-7/AC-1 cells (Fig. 1A).
Furthermore, this androstenedione-induced, estrogen-dependent cell growth can be blocked by 4-hydroxytamoxifen in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). In vivo, AC-1 cells reliably
formed xenografts that were palpable in 3 to 4 weeks upon
androstenedione supplementation (Fig. 1C). Without androstenedione, xenografts did not reliably form. The uteri of AC-1
tumor-bearing mouse were substantially larger in the group
receiving androstenedione compared with controls (Fig. 2A),
supporting the evidence that androstenedione was being
converted to estrogens in vivo and contributing to the proliferative effects on mouse endometrium (Fig. 2B). Thus, in our
model, the tumors being generated are estrogen dependent
and reliably heterotransplanted only in animals receiving
androstenedione, supporting functional aromatase expression
and estradiol production.
Synergistic effect of BMS-754807 in combination with
tamoxifen or letrozole on growth of MCF-7/AC-1 cells in
vitro
On the basis of the ﬁndings above, MCF-7/AC-1 cell proliferation was assessed by treatment with various concentrations
of BMS-754807, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, letrozole, and fulvestrant
either as single agent or 4-hydroxytamoxifen, letrozole, or
fulvestrant in combination with BMS-754807 at a ﬁxed ratio.
At doses of the single agents that had modest antiproliferative
effects, the combination treatment seemed to have a signiﬁcant
antiproliferative effect (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A and C). In comparison
with the single-agent antiproliferative effects, the combination
of BMS-754807 with letrozole, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, or

alone or in combination with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, letrozole, or
fulvestrant. However, the estrogen receptor levels were
decreased in the presence of fulvestrant and letrozole.

fulvestrant was strongly synergistic at the 50% and 75% fraction
affected (P < 0.001; Fig. 3D).
Enhanced effects of combined IGF blockade and
hormonal therapy on AKT and ERK pathway signaling
To investigate possible mechanisms for the synergy between
BMS-754807 and hormonal therapies, we investigated the
effects of BMS-754807 with and without hormonal therapies
on the major proliferation and survival pathways of IGF
signaling–AKT and ERK1/2 (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S2).
BMS-754807 alone very effectively inhibited pIGF-1R and pAKT
and had modest effects on pERK1/2 in MCF-7/AC-1 cells in
vitro. All hormonal therapies investigated enhanced the ability
of BMS-754807 to decreased phosphorylation of IGF-1R and
AKT in the low nanomolar range. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen seemed
to be the most effective at enhancing the inhibition of AKT
phosphorylation in combination with BMS-754807. Fulvestrant was the most effective hormonal therapy at enhancing
the inhibition of IGF-1R phosphorylation by BMS-754807. Only
letrozole seems to substantially reduce the phosphorylation of

Effect of combination of BMS-754807 and tamoxifen or
letrozole on growth of MCF-7/AC-1 cells xenografts in
vivo
To determine whether the in vitro synergy translated into
enhanced tumor regression and improvement in time to tumor
progression, the effects of BMS-754807 in combination with
hormonal therapy was investigated compared with single
agents in vivo. As both tamoxifen and letrozole represent
front-line breast cancer therapies with differing mechanisms
(SERM vs. aromatase inhibitor, respectively), these agents were
selected for in vivo investigations. MCF-7/AC-1 cells were
injected subcutaneously into both ﬂanks of athymic nude mice
supplemented with androstenedione daily (100 mg/mouse/d
s.c.). Once the tumors reached a measurable size of 250 to 300
mm3 (after 4–5 weeks), the mice were randomly assigned to 6
treatment groups so that mean tumor volumes were not
signiﬁcantly different at the start of treatment: control (vehicle
alone), letrozole (10 mg/d s.c.), tamoxifen (500 mg/d s.c.), and
BMS-754807 (50 mg/kg/d), BMS-754807 plus letrozole or plus
tamoxifen. All treatments were given once daily for 28 days
continuously. Animals of all groups were supplemented with
androstenedione daily during the whole experiments.
At the end of 28 days treatment, the tumors in the control
group (203%) doubled in size after 4 weeks, whereas the tumors
in the letrozole (P < 0.0005 vs. control), tamoxifen (P < 0.05 vs.
control), or BMS-754807 (P < 0.005) groups showed signiﬁcant
growth inhibition compared with controls. There was no
signiﬁcant difference in the growth of the tumors in the
single-agent treated groups. The tumors in mice receiving
BMS-754807 with tamoxifen had signiﬁcantly greater antitumor activity compared with either agent alone (Fig. 5A, P <
0.005 for BMS-754807/tamoxifen vs. BMS-754807; P < 0.0005 for
BMS-754807/tamoxifen vs. tamoxifen). Similarly, tumors in
mice receiving BMS-754807 with letrozole had greater antitumor activity than either agent alone (Fig. 5B, P < 0.005 for BMS754807/letrozole vs. BMS-754807; P < 0.05 for BMS-754807/
letrozole vs. letrozole). After 28 days treatment, there was no
signiﬁcant difference between BMS/tamoxifen and BMS/letrozole (P ¼ 0.0514). After 28 days of treatment, the control cohort
animals were sacriﬁced; in the experimental groups, 1 of the 2
ﬂank tumors, which were the biggest, was surgically excised
from each tumor-bearing animal. The mice were then followed
without any treatment except daily androstenedione until the
correlative endpoint (300% tumor growth from treatment
baseline) was met. The tumor volumes were followed by once

Effects of BMS-754807 on mice blood glucose and weight
change
As BMS-754807 is a dual inhibitor with activity against the
IGF-1R and InsR kinase, we explored the tolerability of daily
BMS-754807 as a single agent and in combination with hormonal therapy by assessing blood glucose and animal weight
during the treatment. Comparisons betweens all treatment
groups showed no signiﬁcant difference between any of the
treatment groups during the course of treatment (Fig. 6A; P ¼
0.5622). In contrast, treatment with BMS-754807/tamoxifen
resulted in signiﬁcant weight loss compared with all other
treatment groups (Fig. 6B; P < 0.0001). However, the weight at
treatment end was not different between the treatment groups
(P ¼ 0.2657).
Gene expression proﬁling reveal modulation of cell cycle
and prosurvival pathway genes
To deﬁne the mechanisms of enhanced activity in combination of targeting both the estrogen receptor (ER) and IGF-1R/
InsR, we conducted a microarray study on tumors that were
surgically excised from tumor-bearing animal after 28 days of
treatment. Statistical analyses were done to identify 868 probe
sets representing 698 unique genes that were signiﬁcantly
modulated by any treatment with false discovery rate ¼ 5%
and 2-fold changes when compared with the untreated control
(Supplementary Table S1). Both hormonal agents had similar

7602

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

change in gene expression with some in different directions,
and the combination of BMS-754807 with tamoxifen further
enhanced the changes in gene expression patterns (Fig. 7A).
Both letrozole and tamoxifen decreased IGF-1R expression and
the latter had more signiﬁcant effects, whereas ER expression
was only downregulated by tamoxifen, not by letrozole (Fig. 7B).
BMS-754807 did not alter expression of either IGF-1R or ER
expression, nor did it substantially affect the changes in expression because of hormonal therapy. Signiﬁcant changes were
shown after study treatments in genes involved survival and
proliferation (Fig. 7C and D). Among the cell cycle and survival
genes, BIRC5 (gene for survivin), BCL2, CCNA2 (gene for Cyclin
A2), and MKI67 (gene for Ki-67) were downregulated by study
treatments, though these effects were most profound in the
BMS-754807 þ tamoxifen treatment group, particularly for
MKI67. Receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, MET,
EPHA4, and TGFBR2 were upregulated in response to BMS754807 þ tamoxifen and, to a lesser extent, other study treatments. For example, both hormonal agents increased ERBB4
expression, which was enhanced by BMS-754807; EPHA4, MET,
and TGFBR2 expression were only affected by tamoxifen, not by
letrozole. BMS-754807 in combination with tamoxifen extended the upregulation of these genes; whereas, epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) expression only modestly changed in
response to single drug treatment but increased substantially
by tamoxifen/ BMS-754807 in combination.

BMS-754807 and Hormonal Therapy in Breast Cancer

Figure 4. Inhibition of IGF-1R/InsR,
ERK/Akt phospho signaling
pathways by BMS-754807 alone or
combination with 4-OH Tam
(10 mmol/L), letrozole (10 mmol/L), or
fulvestrant (100 nmol/L). Brieﬂy, cells
were cultured in IMEM steroid–
reduced medium without phenol red
with 1 nmol/L androstenedione for
24 hours, then subconﬂuent MCF-7/
AC-1 cells were treated with either
DMSO, BMS-754807 at the
indicated concentrations, or BMS754807 plus hormones for 24 hours
in serum-free conditions. For the ﬁnal
15 minutes of drug treatment, 10
nmol/L LongR3 IGF-I was added to
the medium. Lysates were then
prepared and analyzed by Western
blotting, as described in the
Methods.

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was done to compare the
involvement of biological functions and canonical signaling
pathways of genes modulated by each treatment condition
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The top signiﬁcant differences in
biological functions (e.g., cell cycle, growth and proliferation,
and cell death) and canonical signaling pathways (e.g., ATM
signaling and p53 signaling) were shown in Supplementary Fig.
S1A and B, respectively. Genes that were further modulated by
tamoxifen and BMS-754807 were involved in cell-cycle regulation (e.g., CCNA2, CCNB1, CCNB2, CCNE2, CDC6, CDC7 CDK2,
CHEK1, and CHEK2), antiapoptosis (e.g., BAG3, BCL2, and
BIRC5), and cell proliferation (e.g., Ki67 and PCNA).

Discussion
We have shown that targeting IGF signaling has antitumor
activity in combination with hormonal therapies. This is
clinically signiﬁcant, as resistance to hormonal therapy is a
common clinical problem that limits survival in patients
with breast cancer (2). As agents targeting IGF-1R/InsR, such
as BMS-754807 are currently undergoing clinical investigation, these data would support the combination of IGFtargeted therapy with hormonal therapy. Interestingly, BMS754807 seems to synergize with hormonal therapies agents
that target ER signaling by different mechanisms with
similar efﬁciency. This would suggest that IGF signaling has
a role in estrogen signaling downstream of the ER. Indeed,

despite having similar in vitro and in vivo efﬁcacy during
treatment, letrozole in combination with BMS-754807
decreased ER expression, whereas tamoxifen in combination
with BMS-754807 led to increased ER expression by Western
blotting (Fig 4). This contrasted the RNA expression of ER in
both cases, suggesting compensatory mechanisms of regulation. In regards to the IGF targeting component, initial
data suggests that the method of IGF targeting does indeed
matter. Preliminary data with the same MCF-7/AC-1 model
suggests that using a mAb against the IGF-1R does not
enhance the efﬁcacy of hormonal therapy in vivo (29, 30).
Although unclear as to why this may be different, mAb
therapy against the IGF-1R induced upregulation of InsR
A expression, which is an IGF signaling receptor (31). This
upregulation of InsR-A expression is not substantially modulated in response to BMS-754807 either as a single agent or
in combination with hormonal therapy. This may also
explain the recent negative clinical trial of the anti–IGF1R mAb AMG-479 in combination with hormonal therapy in
patients with breast cancer (32). These data in summation
would suggest that targeting the InsR is a critical component
of enhancing the antitumor effects of hormonal therapy
targeting in breast cancer.
In regards to targeting the InsR, there are hypothetical
concerns about the safety and tolerability of this approach
(33). This largely contributed to the initial suggestion in the
ﬁeld of selectively targeting IGF signaling with an anti–IGF-1R

tumors grew such that the average of their left and right tumor volumes are between 250 to 300 mm , mice were randomized to each treatment group and given
various treatments for a total of 28 days; treatment groups consisted of 8 to 10 mice per group, and the experiments were repeated 3 times. The tumor
volumes were measured twice weekly. At day 28, the average of the left and right tumor volumes of each mouse and percent change from its pretreatment
average volume was determined, then 1 of the 2 ﬂank tumors was surgically excised from each tumor-bearing animal. Animals were then observed
until study endpoint. Tumor volume was measured at the intervals indicated and expressed as percentage change in tumor volume relative to start of

mAb to avoid metabolic dysregulation and represented the
most viable strategy at the time. However, ironically, among
the most common side effects from anti–IGF-1R–targeted
mAbs is hyperglycemia (22, 34). Importantly, early investigations with IGF-1R/InsR targeting small molecule inhibitors
have shown reasonable tolerability with mild adverse event
proﬁles that include manageable hyperglycemia (35–37). Clinical investigations will be needed to determine whether this is

tolerable and is an effective method of IGF signaling blockade
in combination with hormonal therapy.
The mechanism of synergy between antiestrogen hormonal
therapy and BMS-754807 seems to be multifactorial. We suggest several mechanisms on the basis of the expression analyses that show differences between genes that are modulated
in response to BMS-754807 with tamoxifen and compare this to
the effect of BMS-754807 with letrozole, which had no

improvement in time to study endpoint (Fig. 5C and D). This is
an intriguing comparison as the improvements in the primary
endpoints were similar for BMS-754807 with either tamoxifen
or letrozole (Fig. 5A and B). One can speculate that this results
from the described "withdrawal" response to tamoxifen. Tumor
response after withdrawal of tamoxifen was ﬁrst described
by Legault-Poisson and colleagues (38) and then by other
investigators (39–43). Prospective data has also shown that
up to 40% of patients progressing on tamoxifen had a response
or prolonged stability after tamoxifen withdrawal (44). Withdrawal responses from aromatase inhibitors, however, are not
as well described (45, 46). These clinical ﬁndings may explain
our results following the completion of therapy.
Overall, the DNA microarray data from BMS-754807/tamoxifen-treated tumors suggested a stronger repression of proliferative, cell cycle, DNA damage, and survival markers than
other treatments investigated, including BMS-754807/letrozole. BMS-754807 in combination with tamoxifen had a substantial decrement in Ki-67 gene expression at the end of
treatment in comparison with all other treatments, including
BMS-754807 in combination with letrozole (Fig. 7C). It is
possible that the enhanced effects of the Ki-67 downregulation
after 28 days of treatment with BMS-754807 and tamoxifen led
to the extended beneﬁts of the combination beyond the end of
treatment that were not seen with BMS-754807 in combination
with letrozole. Future studies will be needed to determine
whether this effect contributed to the long-term beneﬁts of the
BMS-754807 plus tamoxifen combination. In addition, canonical pathway analyses for hereditary breast cancer, ATM, DNA
damage, and cell-cycle check point signaling were strikingly
upregulated in response to BMS-754807 þ tamoxifen. Western
blotting also suggested that the combination of BMS-754807

with 4-hydroxytamoxifen maximally blocked survival signaling
through AKT (Fig. 4). Thus, future biomarker evaluations in
studies investigating BMS-754807 in combination with hormonal therapy should include evaluation of cell cycle, DNA
damage, survival, and proliferation markers, including Ki-67.
Expression of the erbB family of receptors, as well as other
receptor tyrosine kinases identiﬁed in Fig. 7D, may also be
important biomarkers of resistance and represent adaptive
mechanisms of escape in response to IGF and estrogen-targeted therapy. Modulation of erbB receptors has been previously described as an adaptive pathway to IGF blockade and
may be sufﬁcient for tumor cells to overcome IGF-targeting
strategies, such as BMS-754807 (27, 47). As erbB-targeted
therapies are available, this may support the rationale for
combinations of BMS-754807 with either EGFR- or HER2targeted therapy in tumors expressing these proteins.
In summary, IGF-1R/InsR inhibition with BMS-754807
enhances the antitumor effects of hormonal therapy in vitro
and in vivo. These preclinical data led us to propose a phase II
noncomparative clinical trial investigating the combination of
BMS-754807 and letrozole or single-agent BMS-754807 in
patients with locally advanced/metastatic, estrogen receptor–positive, nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor–resistant
breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01225172) which
is ongoing. These preclinical data also suggest that BMS754807 with other hormonal agents including tamoxifen or
fulvestrant warrant further investigation.
