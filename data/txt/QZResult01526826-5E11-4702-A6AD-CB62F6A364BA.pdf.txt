Abstract
p21 loss has been implicated in conferring oncogenic activity
to known tumor suppressor gene KLF4 and cancer drug
tamoxifen. Regulators of p21, therefore, play critical roles in
tumorigenesis. Here, we report that X-linked tumor suppressor FOXP3 is essential for p21 expression in normal epithelia
and that lack of FOXP3 is associated with p21 down-regulation
in breast cancer samples. A specific FOXP3 binding site in the
intron 1 is essential for p21 induction by FOXP3. FOXP3
specifically inhibited binding of histone deacetylase 2
(HDAC2) and HDAC4 to the site and increased local histone
H3 acetylation. Short hairpin RNA silencing of either HDAC2
or HDAC4 is sufficient to induce p21 expression. Our data
provides a novel mechanism for transcription activation by
FOXP3 and a genetic mechanism for lack of p21 in a large
proportion of breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2252–9]

Introduction
As a universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 plays an
important role in preventing cell cycle progression by acting at G1
checkpoint (1–4). p21 is down-regulated in many types of cancers,
including the majority of breast cancer (5–7). Absence of p21 has
been shown to confer oncogenic properties to KLF4 (8). Moreover,
p21 loss is causatively related to the tamoxifen-stimulated growth
of breast cancer (9). Surprisingly, p21 mutation is rarely observed in
cancer (10). Instead, p21 has emerged as a major downstream
target of tumor suppressor genes, including p53 (1, 11, 12), BRCA1
(13), CHK2 (14), KLF4 (15, 16), and KLF6 (17). Although p53mediated regulation has been established as a classic example, the
lack of correlation between p53 protein levels (usually used as an
indication of p53 mutation) and the down-regulation of p21 would
argue strongly that p53 mutation is perhaps not the major
underlying cause for p21 loss in breast cancer (5–7). Likewise,
although it has been shown that BRCA1-mediated (13) and Chk2mediated (14) tumor cell cycle arrest and senescence require p21
function, mutations of these two genes had not been established as
the genetic cause for the lack of p21 in the tumors. On the other

hand, epigenetic factors have been suggested as possible mechanisms of p21 silencing in breast cancer cells (18–21).
We reported recently that heterozygous FOXP3 mutation leads
to spontaneous development of mammary tumors (22). The
significance of FOXP3 mutation in human is shown by both
widespread somatic mutation and deletion of the gene in human
breast cancer samples (22). Ectopic expression of the FoxP3 gene
caused profound growth inhibition for breast cancer cell lines both
in vivo and in vitro. Because FoxP3 is a transcription factor, it is
important to identify critical targets of FoxP3 that are responsible
for the tumor suppressor activity of FoxP3. In this context, we have
reported that FoxP3 is a repressor for the HER-2/ErbB2 and Skp2
oncogenes (22, 23). Alternatively, it is possible that FoxP3 may
activate additional tumor suppressor genes. To test this hypothesis,
we used a gene array analysis to identify genes affected by FOXP3.
We uncovered several tumor suppressor genes that were induced
>2-fold after induction of FOXP3. We focused on p21, as it is the
most highly induced tumor suppressor and because of its unique
role in breast cancer biology. Here, we report that FOXP3 is a
potent inducer of p21 in both normal epithelial cells and malignant
breast cancer cell lines. Our data provide a novel mechanism for
FOXP3-mediated activation of tumor suppressor gene.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Rag2 / FoxP3 +/+ and Rag2 / FoxP3sf/sf BALB/c mice have been
described previously (24). Two-month-old virgin mice were used to analyze
the effect of FoxP3 mutation on p21 expression and hyperplasia of mammary
epithelia. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with
accepted standards of animal care and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of University of Michigan.
Cell culture. Breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and immortalized mammary
epithelial cell line MCF-10A were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection. The HO15.19 cell line, which is the c-Myc null derivative
of TGR-1 (25, 26), was a kind gift from Dr. John M. Sedivy of Brown
University. A previously established tet-off FOXP3 expression system in the
MCF-7 cells was also used (22, 23).
Microarray analysis of FOXP3-regulated genes. The FOXP3 tet-off
MCF-7 cells (22, 23) were seeded in six-well plates and cultured with
(2.0 Ag/mL) and without doxycyclin in the culture media. After 48 h of
incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and RNA extraction
was performed with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Contaminated genomic DNA was eliminated with DNase I
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. We conducted mRNA
microarray analyses using HG-U133 Plus 2.0 (Affymetrix) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. We used the most current version of ENTREZ genebased CDFs, as of July 2008, that has been maintained at University of
Michigan for accurate analysis (27). dChip software (University of California
at Los Angeles Clinical Microarray Core) was used to make a heat map of
microarray profiles according to the instruction of the software. Gene

FOXP3+ and FOXP3 cells were calculated by Student’s t test.
FOXP3, p21, and histone deacetylase silencing. Two FOXP3 short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs are FOXP3-993 shRNA and FOXP3-1355
shRNA (Genbank accession no. NM_014009). Oligonucleotides encoding
small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against FOXP3 are 5¶-GCTTCATCTGTGGCATCATCC-3¶ for FOXP3-993-shRNA [993–1013 nucleotides
from transcription starting site (TSS)] and 5¶-GAGTCTGCACAAGTGCTTTGT-3¶ for FOXP3-1355 shRNA (1355–1375 from TSS). The selected
shRNA oligonucleotides were cloned into pSIREN-RetroQ vectors (Clontech) to generate siRNA according to manufacturer’s protocol. The human
p21 shRNA (CGCCTCTGGCATTAGAATTATT), human shHDAC2
(shHDAC2-1, CCGACGGTGATATTGGAAATTA; shHDAC2-2, CGGGCAGATATTTAAGCCTATT), human shHDAC4 (shHDAC4-1, ACGGCATGACTTTATATTGTAT; shHDAC4-2, AGACCGGCATGACTTTATATTG), and control
lentiviral vectors were purchased from Open Biosystems.
Western blot. The anti-FOXP3 (Abcom, 1:1,000), anti-hFOXY (eBioscience, 1:100), anti-p21 (Cell Signaling, 1:1,000), and anti–h-actin (Sigma,
1:3,000) were used as primary antibodies. Anti-rabbit or mouse IgG
horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary antibody at 1:3,000 to 1:5,000
dilutions (Cell Signaling) was used. To ensure equal loading of proteins, the
membranes were stripped under the same conditions as described above.
They were then incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents
(Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to X-ray film for 1 to 5 min.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) was carried out according to published procedure (28). Briefly, the
FOXP3-transfected tet-off cells were sonicated and fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde. The anti-FOXP3, anti–acetyl-H3 (Cell Signaling), anti–
histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), anti-HDAC2, anti-HDAC3, anti-HDAC4,
anti-HDAC5, anti-HDAC7 (Cell Signaling), and anti-IgG (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) antibodies were used to pull down chromatin associated
with FOXP3. The amounts of the specific DNA fragment were quantitated
by real-time PCR and normalized against the genomic DNA preparation

from the same cells. The ChIP real-time PCR primers are listed in
Supplementary Table S3.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Relative quantities of mRNA expression
were analyzed using real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection
System, Applied Biosystems). The SYBR (Applied Biosystems) green
fluorescence dye was used in this study. The primer sequences are listed
in Supplementary Table S3.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed by the
avidin-biotin complex method. Expression of FOXP3 in human breast
cancer or normal tissue samples was determined using immunohistochemistry, as described (22, 23). The p21 mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell
Signaling, 1:100) and biotin goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, 1:200) were
used as secondary antibodies. FOXP3 and p21 staining were scored double
blind.
Statistical analysis. Data are shown as means F SD. Statistical analysis
was performed with Student’s t test for means from two groups. ANOVA test
was used for ANOVA between several groups. m2 test was used to compare
the relationship between the expression of FOXP3 and p21.

Results
p21 is up-regulated after FOXP3 induction and contributes
to its tumor suppressor activity. We used the MCF-7 cell lines
engineered to express FOXP3 in the absence doxycyclin. The cells
cultured in the presence or absence of doxyclin for 48 hours were
compared with five independent RNA isolates in each group by
gene array analysis. A summary of the gene array data, depicting
genes that are induced by >2-fold, is shown in Fig. 1A. The full data
set is shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, and the raw data
are deposited to MIAExpress (accession no. E-MTAB-73).
Among the FOXP3-induced genes are several tumor suppressors,
including p18, p21, LAT2, and ARHGAPS (Fig. 1A). We have chosen

The untransfected cells were removed by

transfection, the protein levels were
determined by Western blotting, using
specific anti-FOXP3, anti-p21, and h-actin
antibodies as loading control. The mRNA
levels of the FOXP3 and p21 transcripts
were quantitated by real-time PCR. The
RNA inputs were normalized against the
housekeeping gene GAPDH . The vector

p21 as the prototype to study the mechanism by which FOXP3
activates tumor suppressors as the relevance of defective p21 in
breast cancer is well established. In addition, real-time PCR showed
induction of p18 is <2-fold (data not shown). We first used realtime PCR and Western blot to confirm the induction of p21 after
the inducible expression of FOXP3. As shown in Fig. 1B, p21
transcripts were induced by 7-fold in the MCF-7-pBI-FOXP3/green
fluorescent protein (GFP) cell line after removal of doxycyclin, but
not the MCF-7-pBI-GFP/control cell line under the same culture
condition. Western blot analysis confirmed that accumulation of
p21 protein followed that of FOXP3 (Fig. 1C). To determine
whether induction of p21 contributed to tumor suppression, we
transfected the MCF-7 cell lines with either control vector or p21
shRNA. The transfectants were cultured in the absence of
doxycyclin for 10 days and were stained by crystal violets. As
shown in Fig. 2B, p21 shRNA specifically increased the number of
colonies in the cell line that expressed FOXP3, but barely so for

those that expressed GFP. Microscopically, the sizes of colonies
were usually larger in the shRNA group, even for those that
expressed GFP only, consistent with the notion that endogenous
p21 in the MCF-7 cells limited its growth potential (Fig. 2A). Even
in the p21-silenced group, FOXP3 transfection still reduces the
number of colonies by nearly 60%, which is consistent with the
contribution of other FOXP3 targets, including those that we have
reported recently (22, 23). Nevertheless, the partial restoration of
the colonies indicated that p21 induction contributes to the tumor
suppressor activity of the FOXP3 gene.
FOXP3 maintains p21 levels in normal mammary epithelial
cells. An important issue is whether FOXP3 expression contributes
to expression of p21 in normal mammary epithelial cells. As shown
in Fig. 2C, the FOXP3 protein can be identified by Western blot in
immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. To
determine the role of FOXP3 in p21 expression, we used FOXP3
shRNA to silence FOXP3 expression and measured the levels of p21

An Epigenetic Mechanism of p21 Induction by FOXP3

transcripts. As shown in Fig. 2D, FOXP3 silencing caused a 5-fold to
10-fold reduction of the p21 transcripts, which revealed a critical
role for FOXP3 in maintaining p21 expression in mammary
epithelial cells. A similar effect was observed when FOXP3 was
silenced in the early passage of primary human mammary
epithelial culture (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To test the role of FoxP3 in p21 expression in vivo, we
microdissected mammary epithelium from 2-month-old Rag2 /
FoxP3sf/sf and Rag2 / FoxP3 +/+ mice. The amounts of p21 transcripts were determined by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
FoxP3 mutation caused f6-fold reduction in p21 transcripts.
Perhaps due to nonmediated decay caused by frameshift mutation,
mammary epithelia from FoxP3 mutant mice lacked FoxP3
transcripts. Correspondingly, dramatically increased numbers of
breast epithelial cells in the Rag2 / FoxP3sf/sf mice have entered
the cell cycle, as judged by Ki67 staining (Fig. 3B). H&E staining of
the mammary tissue indicated extensive ductal hyperplasia in the
Rag2 / FoxP3sf/sf mice (Fig. 3C). These data showed that the FoxP3
mutation leads to reduced p21 expression and increased proliferation of normal epithelium in vivo. Because the young mice had yet
to develop mammary tumor at this age, down-regulation of p21 is
not due to the secondary effect of malignant transformation.
Correlation between expressions of FOXP3 and p21 in
human breast cancer. The majority of breast cancer samples lack
p21 and FOXP3 expression (5–7, 22, 23). An important issue is,
therefore, whether the expression of the two genes is interrelated
among human breast cancer samples. To address this issue, we
analyzed 62 cases of breast cancer samples in TMA for expression
of FOXP3. As shown in Fig. 4, among the FOXP3+ samples, 66% are
also p21+. In contrast, only 30% of the FOXP3 samples expressed
p21. The strong correlation between FOXP3 and p21 expression
suggests that FOXP3 down-regulation may be an important factor
for the lack of p21 among breast cancer tissue.
Specific binding of FOXP3 to the p21 locus is essential for
activation of p21. Two p21 mRNA isoforms (1, NM_078467 and 2,
NM_000389) have been reported with different exon 1–exon 2
junctions. To properly align the genomic structure of the locus, we
sequenced the p21 RNA from the MCF-7 cells after the induction of
FOXP3. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, only isoform 2 was
produced in FOXP3-transfected MCF-7 cells. This allowed us to
assign the position of intron 1 for the p21 locus. As illustrated in
Fig. 5A (top), a large number of forkhead binding motifs RYMAAYA
(29, 30) and TRTKTRC (refs. 31, 32; R = A, G; M = A, C; Y = C, T; K = G,
T) can be identified throughout the p21 gene. To identify the sites
that bind to FOXP3, we induced FOXP3 by culturing the cell line in
the absence of doxycyclin and then used ChIP to determine whether
FOXP3 interact with the p21 locus. To normalize the efficiency of
PCR primers, the products were compared with input DNA
amplified by the same primers. As shown in Fig. 5A (middle),
quantitative analysis show that peak binding activity localized at the
forkhead/HNF-3 binding motif at 0.2 kb 3¶ of TSS. Low but detectable
levels of DNA are observed over an 8-kb fragment, which could be
due to either the low resolution of ChIP or the existence of multiple
weaker binding sites. To confirm the specific requirement for FOXP3
for the signal at 0.2 kb, we also compared the signal to uninduced
pBI-FOXP3/GFP cell lines and pBI-GFP control cell lines cultured in
the presence or absence of doxycyclin. As shown in Fig. 5A (bottom),
the p21 region is precipitated if, and only if, FOXP3 was induced.
To directly show the function and specificity of the FOXP3mediated induction of p21, we first produced three constructs
consisting of overlapping fragments of the 5¶ of the p21 locus

positive. Magnification, 600. Bottom, summary data from 62 independent

(Fig. 5B). Using a dual-luciferase assay, we found that FOXP3mediated induction of p21 requires sequences that are both 5¶ and
3¶ to TSS, with the maximal activity requiring 540 and +365 bp at
5¶ and 3¶, respectively. Further extension at 3¶ significantly reduced
the p21 induction (Fig. 5B). We, therefore, used the optimal
reporter to confirm the function of the forkhead binding site at the
0.2 kb at 3¶ of TSS. As shown in Fig. 5C, whereas wild-type (WT)
reporter is induced by FOXP3 expression, mutation of the forkhead
binding site abrogated induction. These data showed that the
specific cis-element is essential for FOXP3-mediated activation of
p21 locus.
It has been shown that c-Myc can target the p21 promoter and
inhibit its expression (33–35). To determine whether the FOXP3
gene regulates p21 directly, we measured the effects of FOXP3 on
the p21 promoter activity in the c-Myc knockout cell line. As shown
in Fig. 5D, the promoter activity of p21 was significantly induced by
FOXP3 in c-Myc knockout cells. The relatively low induction,
compared with HEK 293 cells, is likely due to the drastically
reduced transfection efficiency of the Myc-deficient cell line.4
Localized chromatin modification as a mechanism for
FOXP3-induced expression of p21. Recent studies showed that
FOXP3-mediated induction of gene expression is associated with
histone acetylation (36). We, therefore, used anti–acetyl-H3 antibodies to monitor local chromatin changes associated with FOXP3
binding. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, in cells expressing FOXP3, H3
acetylation in the +0.2-kb site of p21 was increased by >2-fold. The
increase in the neighboring areas mirrored what was observed with
FOXP3 binding. These data showed that FOXP3 enhances the H3
acetylation of p21, especially at the 0.2-kb region. We carried out

ChIP analysis using antibodies specific for HDAC1 to HDAC7. The
MCF-7 cells with or without FOXP3 induction were compared. As
shown in Fig. 6B, a generalized reduction of HDAC association to
the p21 locus was observed after FOXP3 induction. However, by far,
the strongest effect was observed at the 0.2-kb site, wherein FOXP3
associates with the p21 locus. Moreover, although a reduction of
HDAC1 to HDAC7 was observed after FOXP3 binding, the most
significant reduction was observed on HDAC2 and HDAC4, as
these two HDACs showed the strongest association before FOXP3
induction.
To determine whether HDAC2 and HDAC4 are involved in p21
up-regulation, we used shRNAs to modulate their expression. As
shown in Fig. 6C, two independent shRNAs were specifically

silencing the expression of either HDAC2 or HDAC4. Correspondingly, the levels of p21 transcripts were increased by 2-fold to 3-fold
after the silence of either gene. Note that some of the p21 protein
induced by HDAC shRNAs had a molecular weight of 15 kDa rather
than 21 kDa. This is likely due to the cleavage of p21 associated
with a general increase in histone acetylation, as reported by others
(37). To test if HDAC2 and HDAC4 are necessary mediators of p21
induction by FOXP3, we transfected FOXP3 into MCF-7 cells, in
which HDAC2 and HDAC4 are silenced, and compared the levels of
p21 in either FOXP3-tracnsfected or vector control–transfected
cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, FOXP3-mediated induction of p21 is
abrogated in the HDAC4-silenced cell lines. These data further
support the notion that FOXP3-mediated induction of p21 is

experiment has been repeated twice with similar results. D, p21 transcription is directly induced by FOXP3 by a c-Myc –independent mechanism. Transfection of

15 kDa whereas those in the control group consisted of mostly intact p21. These experiments have been repeated four times with similar results. D, silencing
HDAC4 abrogates induction of p21 by FOXP3. Control or HDAC2/HDAC4-silenced MCF-7 cells were transfected with FOXP3 cDNA. After removal of nontransfected
cells by blasticidin, the levels of p21 transcripts were determined by real-time PCR. Data have been repeated twice. E, diagram of a proposed mechanism of

Discussion
Mechanism of p21 regulation in normal and cancerous epithelial
cells may hold the keys to the molecular mechanism of
carcinogenesis. Here, we present several lines of evidence

demonstrating a critical role of p21 as a downstream target of
FOXP3, and its expression contributes to the FOXP3-mediated
growth inhibition of a breast cancer cell line.
First, in confirming the cDNA microarray data, we showed that
inducible expression of FOXP3 induced the p21 transcripts and
protein in breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The induction is mediated
by transcription regulation, as it is reflected in luciferase assay.
ChIP analysis revealed that a specific site at 0.2 kb downstream of

TSS is necessary for FOXP3-mediated induction by FOXP3.
Moreover, the induction is not an artifact of FOXP3 overexpression,
as shRNA silencing of the FOXP3 gene leads to a dramatic
reduction of p21 in primary mammary epithelial cells.
Second, to determine whether induction of p21 contributes to
growth inhibition of the tumor cell line, we tested whether blunting
p21 induction by shRNA abrogate growth inhibition by FOXP3. Our
data showed the significant, albeit incomplete, rescue of FOXP3mediated growth inhibition. The significant rescue shows an
important role of p21 induction in FOXP3-mediated growth
inhibition in MCF-7 cell line. Other recent studies indicate that
FOXP3 also inhibits growth by repressing the expression of HER-2
and SKP2 (22, 23). Thus, depending on tumor cell lines used,
FOXP3-mediated inhibition of oncogenes and induction of tumor
suppressor may work either independently or in concert to cause
growth inhibition of breast cancer cell line.
Third, our analysis of 62 cases of breast cancer samples showed
a significant correlation between expression of FOXP3 and p21.
Nevertheless, not unlike other tumor suppressor targets, there was
no 1:1 correlation between expression of FOXP3 and p21. For
instance, f30% of cases that stained positive for FOXP3 still lack
detectable p21. This is, in part, due to the fact that nearly one
third of breast cancer samples show somatic missense mutation of
FOXP3 (22, 23). Conversely, nearly one third of the FOXP3 negative
tumor cells still express p21. This can be due to either the falsenegative staining of FOXP3, perhaps relating to the quality of
tumor tissues, or the levels of FOXP3 expression in the first place.
In addition, because p53 can induce p21 expression, it is possible
that the p21 expression in FOXP3-negative tumor samples was due
to functional p53. The limited sample set used in this study cannot
distinguish these possibilities. Regardless of how the discrepancies
are explained, the positive association between p21 and FOXP3 in
clinical samples, when viewed in the context of the data in mice
with FoxP3 mutation and the in vitro analysis of normal and
malignant tumor cells, made a compelling case that FOXP3 is a
major regulator for p21 expression in breast cancer. Recent
studies revealed an interesting role of p21 loss and tamoxifenstimulated growth of breast cancer (9). It is of great interest to
determine whether genetic lesion to FOXP3 may account for
the p21 loss and, therefore, the unusual response to a widely
used drug.

Finally, whereas a number of studies have addressed the
mechanism of FOXP3-mediated gene repression, the mechanism
by which FOXP3 directly induces gene expression remained largely
obscure. A recent report showed association between FOXP3induced gene activation and histone acetylation (36), although the
mechanism and significance of such acetylation have not been
addressed. Our data showed that FOXP3 binding to a specific site
in intron 1 of p21 increased histone H3 acetylation by reducing
binding of HDAC4 and HDAC2 to the same site (Fig. 6E). Gene
silencing with shRNA confirmed the significance of these two
HDACs in p21 expression, although FOXP3 did not repress
expression of either HDAC2 or HDAC4 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Therefore, our data provide a novel mechanism for FOXP3mediated transcription activation. Because FOXP3 has been shown
to recruit histone acetyl transferases (38), it is of interest to
investigate whether this interaction contributes, either directly or
indirectly, to increased H3 acetylation in the p21 locus.
Taken together, our data showed p21 as a downstream target for
FOXP3, the first X-linked tumor suppressor in breast cancer.
Because p21 serves as an important target for all major tumor
suppressor genes of breast cancer and because irreversible genetic
lesion to p21 is relatively rare, it might be possible to reactivate p21
in cancer by inducing FOXP3. Whereas p21 induction can be
achieved by a general silencing of HDAC2 and HDAC4, the induced
p21 are rapidly degraded, presumably due to the simultaneous
induction of other proteins involved in p21 cleavage (37). On the
other hand, our data showed that p21 induced by FOXP3 remained
intact and mediates tumor suppression. Therefore, reactivating
FOXP3 may prove to be a more relevant approach.
