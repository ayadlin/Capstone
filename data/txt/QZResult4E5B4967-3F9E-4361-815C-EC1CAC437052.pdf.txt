ABSTRACT
Current therapies for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) still fail to significantly
increase its survival rate. Here we asked whether Interleukin(IL)-27, which has
revealed powerful antitumor activity and is toxicity-free in humans, is a promising
therapeutic choice for NSCLC patients.
IL-27’s effects were tested on Adenocarcinoma (AC) and Squamous
Cell Carcinoma (SCC) cell lines and xenograft models. IL-27Receptor(R) expression
was assessed in lung tissues from 78 NSCLC patients.
In vitro, IL-27 was ineffective on cancer cell proliferation or apoptosis, but
fostered CXCL3/GROγ/MIP2β expression. In vitro and in vivo, IL-27 down-regulated
stemness-related genes, namely SONIC HEDGEHOG in AC cells, and OCT4A, SOX2,
NOTCH1, KLF4 along with Nestin, SNAI1/SNAIL, SNAI2/SLUG and ZEB1, in SCC cells.
In vivo, IL-27 hampered both AC and SCC tumor growth in association with a prominent
granulocyte- and macrophage-driven colliquative necrosis, CXCL3 production, and a
reduced pluripotency- and EMT-related gene expression. Myeloablation of tumorbearing hosts mostly abolished IL-27’s antitumor effects. In clinical samples, IL-27R
expression was found in AC, SCC, pre-cancerous lesions and tumor infiltrating myeloid
cells, and correlated with advanced stages of disease.
Our data suggest that even immunocompromised or advancer NSCLC patients
may benefit from IL-27’s antitumor properties based on its ability to drive myeloid
cells towards antitumor activities, and down-regulate stemness- and EMT-related
genes in cancer cells.

AC, but are unsuitable for SCC [4, 5]. Moreover, not all
AC patients benefit from these treatments [5]. Development
of effective and well tolerable immunotherapies to replace
or be combined with surgery, radiotherapy or personalized
treatments may be of great value. In the last few years,
Interleukin(IL)-27, a member of the IL-12 family of
cytokines, with important roles in both innate and adaptive
immunity [6, 7], has revealed potent antitumor effects in the

mortality worldwide [1, 2]. Non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC), particularly, adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous

effects in vivo, has been documented by us and others [8–10].
Unexpectedly, in both Calu-6 and SK-MES lines, hrIL-27
treatment considerably (P < 0.05) up-regulated, 18.53 and,
13.7 times respectively, the mRNA expression of CXCL3
(Figure 1C), also known as Growth-Related Oncogene
(GRO)3, GRO protein gamma (GROγ) and Macrophage
Inflammatory Protein 2 beta (MIP2β), an angiogenic ELR+
CXC chemokine [14], identified as a powerful neutrophil
chemoattractant [15, 16], and also driving migration and
adhesion of monocytes and macrophages [17].
Other angiogenesis-related genes were differently
regulated by IL-27 in the two lines (Figure 1C). In
SK-MES cells only, hrIL-27 up-regulated IFNγ (6.13
times) and down-regulated LAMA5, encoding for
Laminin-α5 (4.5 times), and THBS1, encoding for
Thrombospondin-1 (8.64 times), whereas in Calu6 cells, hrIL-27 selec­tively up regulated Cadherin 5
(CDH5), i.e.: Vascular Endothelial (VE)-Cadherin (4.5
times), and the Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1
(TYMP-1) (5.3 times) encoding for Platelet Derived
Endothelial Cell Growth Factor 1 (ECGF1).
Within a range of stemness-related genes (including
NANOG, BMI1, CD44v6, c-MYC, see Supplementary
information), in SK-MES cells, hrIL-27 significantly
(P < 0.05) down-regulated mRNA expression levels
of Octamer-binding Transcription Factor 4A, OCT4A
(5.7 times), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2,
SOX2 (4.0 times), SOX9 (7.1 times), Notch homolog 1,
NOTCH1 (7.0 times), and Krüppel-like factor 4, KLF4
(6.1 times) (Figure 1D), whereas in Calu-6 cells it only
down-modulated mRNA expression of Sonic Hedgehog,
SHH (4.2 times) (Figure 1E). Moreover, in SK-MES cells,
hrIL-27 down-modulated mRNA expression levels of
Nestin (6.7 times), associated with cell stemness and EMT
[18, 19], and within the ZEB, SNAIL and TWIST families
of EMT-activating transcription factors [20, 21], hrIL-27
down-modulated mRNA expression of Snail family
zinc finger 1, SNAI1/SNAIL (5.0 times), Snail family
zinc finger 2, SNAI2/SLUG (4.3 times), and Zinc finger
E-­box binding homeobox 1, ZEB1 (5.0 times) (Figure 1F),
whereas the expression of c-MET, also involved in EMT
[22, 23], and that of ZEB2, TWIST1, and TWIST2 remained
unaffected.

form of anti-proliferation, anti-angiogenesis, and immune
system stimulation in a variety of tumors [8–10]. Its overexpression in murine Lewis lung carcinoma line 1 (LLC1)
cells induces a specific cytotoxic T cell and antibody
response in vivo, and also activates non-immunological
mechanisms reducing cancer cell motility and migration
[11]. Inhibition of AC cell migration, together with downregulation of pro-angiogenesis genes by IL-27 has also been
reported in the human A549 AC cell line [12]. Moreover,
murine IL-27 gene-transfected LLC1 cells have been used to
generate an autologous cell vaccine boosting an efficient T
lymphocyte activation and IFNγ production [13]. However,
definitive in vivo proof of IL-27’s efficacy in pre-clinical
models of human lung AC and SCC is still lacking.
We here investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects
of IL-27 on the regulation of angiogenesis-, stemness- and
epitelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes in
human AC and SCC cell lines and lung tumors grown
in B/T cell deficient mice. Furthermore, by means of
molecular biology and immunohistochemical studies,
we have assessed IL-27Receptor(R) expression in lung
cancer samples and analyzed the rationale for a future
IL-27 application in the clinical setting of NSCLC.

RESULTS
Human lung AC and SCC cell lines express IL27R and respond to IL-27 up-regulating CXCL3
expression and down-modulating stemness- and
EMT-related genes
Since AC and SCC are the most common histotypes
of lung cancers, ~85% of NSCLC [1, 3], we looked to see
whether IL-27 acts as an antitumor agent in these forms.
Expression of both chains of the IL-27R, gp130
and WSX-1 (TCCR, IL-27Rα), was investigated, by flow
cytometry, in a series of cell lines derived from human
lung AC, namely A549, GLC82, Calu-6 or from SCC,
namely Calu-1 and SK-MES. As shown in Figure 1A
and 1B, Calu-6 and SK-MES lines expressed the highest
levels of both chains (gp130: 68% and 65%; WSX-1:
97% and 70% respectively) and were therefore chosen
as representative of AC and SCC histotypes for the
subsequent experiments.
We began by determining whether IL-27 affects
the in vitro proliferation or apoptosis of these lines by
culturing them with or without human (h) recombinant
(r) hrIL-27 for 120 hours, and harvesting an aliquot every
24 hours to be analyzed for CFSE intracellular staining
and for apoptosis. In both lines hrIL-27 was unable to
directly modulate proliferation or apoptosis (not shown).
We next investigated whether IL-27 regulated, in both
lines, sets of genes shaping tumor malignancy and specifically
related to angiogenesis, stemness and invasiveness.

In vivo studies using pre-clinical models of

Calu-6 and SK-MES cell lines respectively, showed
that hrIL-27 considerably reduced tumor growth in

in hrIL-27-treated mice was 54.22 ± 24.2 mm3
versus 241 ± 69 mm3 of tumors from controls
(P = 0.0336) (Figure 2A), whereas the mtv ± SE of SKMES tumors was 59.08 ± 13.1 mm3 versus 123.3 ± 24.5
mm3 of tumors from controls (P = 0.0469) (Figure 2B).
To get an insight into the mechanisms underlying
the in vivo antitumor effects of IL-27, tumor growth/
suppression areas were histopathologically analyzed. The
histologic features of Calu-6 and SK-MES tumors from
control mice, recalled human poorly-differentiated AC
and SSC, respectively. Tumors harvested from hrIL-27treated mice displayed wide areas of colliquative necrosis
characterized by a prominent reactive cell infiltrate,
(Figure 2C and 2D), in addition, SK-MES tumors also
presented evident alterations in cancer cell morphology
ranging from a spindle to a polygonal-round phenotype
(Figure 2D). Inflammatory infiltrates were wider in
both Calu-6 and SK-MES tumors from hrIL-27-treated
mice than in control tumors, because of the significant
(P < 0.05) increase in their granulocyte and macrophage
content, along with cancer cell expression of CXCL3
(Figure 2C and 2D) (Table 3). In addition to the areas of
colliquative necrosis, frequent apoptotic features were
evidenced, by the TUNEL assay, close to granulocytes
identified by their segmented nuclei, (Figure 2C and 2D),
in both Calu-6 and SK-MES tumors from hrIL-27-treated
mice (Figure 2C and 2D) (Table 3).
To understand the molecular mechanism underlying
apoptotic events in vivo, we next assessed in tumors
from hrIL-27-treated and control mice the expression
of apoptosis-inducing proteins Tumor Necrosis Factor
(TNF)α and TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand
(TRAIL). Immunostainings revealed that TRAIL was
almost undetectable, while TNFα expression was distinct
to strong, in the foci of reactive infiltrates, in both tumor
types harvested from hrIL-27-treated mice (Figure 2C and
2D) (Table 3).
Lastly immunohistochemical analyses revealed
that the microvascular network of Calu-6 tumors from
hrIL-27-treated mice was similar to that of the controls
whereas that of SK-MES tumors from hrIL-27-treated
mice was clearly impaired (Figure 2C and 2D) (Table 3) in
association with a weakened laminin network and a faint,
but distinct cancer cell expression of IFNγ (Figure 3A).

tumors (Figure 3B), whereas in SK-MES tumors from
treated animals, the percentage of cells endowed with a
distinct to strong nuclear staining for OCT4A, NOTCH1,
and KLF4 was clearly decreased (Table 3) as was reduced
the percentage of tumor cells displaying both nuclear and
cytoplasmic SOX2 positivity and nuclear SOX9 positivity
(Figure 3C) (Table 3). Expression of Nestin was weakened
in cancer cells forming SK-MES tumors from IL-27treated mice (Figure 3D). Nuclear and cytoplasmic SNAI1
stainings were dramatically and moderately reduced
respectively, and the percentage of cancer cells endowed
with a distinct to strong nuclear SNAI1, SNAI2, and ZEB1
staining also significantly (P < 0.05) decreased following
hrIL-27 treatment (Figure 3D), whereas E-Cadherin
expression was reinforced in tumors from hrIL27-treated
mice (Figure 3D) (Table 3).

Myeloablation by treosulfan thwarts the in vivo
anti-lung cancer effects of IL-27
To assess whether granulocytes and macrophages
may, as suggested by the morphological data, account
for the anti-lung cancer effects of IL-27 in vivo, we next
repeated tumor growth experiments in mice pre-treated
with myeloablative doses of treosulfan to obtain a severe
or complete depletion of bone marrow cells [18].
These experiments revealed that after this treatment
both Calu-6 and SK-MES tumors grew similarly in hrIL27-treated and control mice. In particular, the mtv ± SE of
Calu-6 tumors harvested from myeloablated and IL-27treated mice was 153.4 ± 29.9 mm3 versus 169 ± 33.99
mm3 of tumors from myeloablated controls (Figure 4A).
The mtv ± SE of SK-MES tumors from myeloablated and
IL-27-treated mice was 34.6 ± 4 mm3 versus 33.6 ± 5.65
mm3 of tumors from myeloablated controls (Figure 4B). Of
note, both Calu-6 and, particularly, SK-MES tumors grown
in myeloablated control mice were smaller than tumors
developed in not-myeloablated control mice (Calu-6:
P = 0.0317 and SK-MES: P = 0.0159).
Histological features of both Calu-6 and SKMES tumors developed in myeloablated hrIL-27-treated
mice were similar to those from myeloablated controls.
However, both histotypes, developed in myeloablated
mice, independently from hrIL-27-treatment, presented
small ischaemic necrotic foci (Figure 4C) in association
with an evident (vessel counts: 3 ± 2 in Calu-6, and 5 ± 2
in SK-MES tumors from myeloablated controls, versus 9
± 3 in Calu-6, and 12 ± 4 in SK-MES tumors from nonmyeloablated controls; P < 0.05) decrease of the whole
vascular supply (Figure 4C). These tumours were almost
devoid of granulocyte and macrophage content (Figure
4C). CXCL3 was still firmly expressed by tumor cells
in both Calu-6 and SK-MES tumors from myeloablated
and hrIL-27-treated mice (Figure 4C), while a faint IFNγ
production was only detected in the latter.

IL-27 down-modulates stemness- and EMTrelated genes, particularly in SCC tumors
To assess whether IL-27 regulation of pluripotencyand EMT-related genes also occurs in vivo at protein level,
we carried out immunohistochemical analyses of tumors
from hrIL-27- and PBS-treated mice.
In Calu-6 tumors from hrIL-27-treated animals, the
percentage of cancer cells displaying a distinct to strong
SHH staining was decreased compared with control

tumors grown in PBS treated mice had the features of poorly-differentiated human lung AC (rare glandular lumen) and SSC (epithelial cells

of colliquative necrosis (N) and, particularly for SK-MES tumor cells, the acquisition of a more polygonal-round morphology (inset). Both
histotypes from hrIL-27-treated mice showed a prominent granulocyte (PMN) and macrophage (CD11b/CD18) infiltrate, along with a strong
CXCL3 production by tumor cells in comparison with control tumors. Following hrIL-27 treatment apoptotic events, close to cells endowed
with segmented nuclei (inset), were frequent, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, in both histotypes, whereas they were almost absent in control
tumors, and a distinct to strong expression of TNFα was detected at the sites of reactive infiltrates, whereas it was lacking in control tumors.
The microvascular network supplying Calu-6 tumors from hrIL-27-treated mice was similar to that of control tumors. By contrast, in SK-MES
tumors from hrIL-27-treated mice it was evidently impoverished, in comparison with control tumors. (C and D: H&E, PMN, CD11b/CD18,

Human lung AC and SCC, and their
precursor lesions express IL-27R in neoplastic
and dysplastic cells, microvessels and
tumor-associated reactive cells

provide a new therapeutic option in NSCLC. Previous
studies assessing IL-27’s effects in lung cancer have used
mouse autograft models [11, 13] or, in vitro experiments
with both murine and human lung AC cell lines [11, 12].
Our data confirm, in pre-clinical xenograft models of
human lung AC and SCC, the anti-lung cancer effects of
IL-27. They have also revealed unforeseen implications
for its immunological antitumor capability in the form of
I. boosting the potent granulocyte/macrophage chemoattractant CXCL3, in both AC and SCC cells, leading to
intratumoral myeloid cell recruitment and activation, and
II. re-education of these immune cells from the status of
“cancer feeder”, and host-detrimental [29, 30] towards that
of “cancer killer”, thus host-beneficial [30–32].
Tumor destruction by the prominent neutrophil
and macrophage influx mediated by CXCL3 [15–17]
overcomes, at least in our setting, its well-known proangiogenic effects [14], since microvessel density
remained unaltered in AC and slightly decreased in SCC
tumors from IL-27-treated animals, when compared with
controls. Anti-angiogenesis has a marginal or nil role
in IL-27’s anti-lung cancer efficacy, and apart from a
slight IFNγ induction and LAMININ-α5 down-regulation
observed in SCC cells, IL-27 even down-regulates the
angiogenesis inhibitor THROMBOSPONDIN-1 [33] in
SK-MES cells, and up-regulates VE-CADHERIN [34]
and the pro-angiogenesis gene TYMP-1, encoding for
ECGF1 [35], in Calu-6 cells, but without significant in
vivo consequences for tumor vascularity.
Granulocytes and macrophages are endowed
with IL-27R, and may respond to IL-27 by increasing
their oxidative burst and cytokine production [36–38],
suggesting that the range of action for this cytokine is not
restricted to T cells, the key mediators of its antitumor
effect in an immune-intact host [9]. Our results provide
the first evidence that intratumor recruited and activated
myeloid cells may, in a B/T cell-deficient host, take the
place of T lymphocytes in mediating IL-27’s antitumor
activity, leading to a dramatic colliquative necrosis, and
TNFα-associated apoptotic events in both AC and SCC.
While extending to human SCC in vivo the finding
of IL-27’s down-modulation of EMT transcription
factors such as SNAI1, SNAI2 and ZEB1 [20, 21], our
discoveries identify a novel role for IL-27 as a negative
regulator of pluripotency genes such as SHH in human AC
cells, and SOX2, OCT4A, NOTCH1, KLF4, SOX9 and
Nestin [18, 19] in human SCC cells, both in vitro and in
vivo. EMT, a key event during the early phases of invasion
and metastatization, selects for stem cell property [39],
which, in turn, may condition the self-renewal capability
of a cancer and correlate with its aggressiveness [40, 41].
Down-regulation of critical pluripotency genes by IL-27
increases the propensity of cells to differentiate towards
a less aggressive phenotype [42–44] as shown by their
transition from a fibroblast-like to a polygonal-round
E-Cadherin-positive phenotype.

To determine whether lung cancer patients
could benefit from IL-27’s antitumor effects, we next
immunohistochemically evaluated the expression and
distribution of IL-27R in AC and SCC tissue sections.
Since expression of gp130 has been documented in lung
cancer [24, 25], we only assessed IL-27Rα expression
in both cancerous and normal lung samples (from both
cancer and control patients). In the normal tissue, it
was basically found in mononuclear/macrophage-like
cells fluctuating within alveolar walls (Figure 5D).
Normal bronchial epithelia firmly expressed IL-27Rα
mRNA, whereas in neoplastic samples it was expressed
by the majority of AC, 90%, and SCC, 84% (Table 2)
(Figure 5A and 5D). Furthermore, within AC, metastatic
tumors revealed significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression
levels of IL-27Rα mRNA than normal bronchial epithelia
(Figure 5B). Notably, IL-27Rα expression in microdissected
bronchial epithelium from normal samples of patients with
lung cancer was analogous to that in control patients. These
molecular data showed a good correlation (ρ = 0.82) with
the immunohistochemical findings.
IL-27Rα expression by the primary tumor was
significantly associated with lymph node status (P = 0,001),
and advanced stages of disease (P = 0,02) as assessed by
Fisher’s exact test, whereas no significant association was
observed with patient age or smoking history.
Immunohistochemistry also revealed IL-27Rα
expression in AC and SCC precursor lesions, namely
atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and severe
dysplasia, squamous metaplasia (SM), squamous cell
carcinoma in situ (SCIS) (Figure 5D), respectively
(Table 1). IL-27Rα expression may also be found in
microvessels and infiltrating immune cells (Figure 5C),
mostly identifiable as CD68+ monocytes/macrophages
(Figure 5D) and CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells. They
were found in the stroma of both AC and SCC, scattered
or within the lymph node–like structures, known as
tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) (Figure 5D) [26, 27].
CD15+ granulocytes that may be found in necrotic foci
of rapidly growing tumors also expressed IL-27Rα
(Figure 5D).

DISCUSSION
AC and SCC constitute the commonly diagnosed
lung cancer histotypes [1, 2], but their management still
results in low overall cure rates, suggesting the need for
novel therapeutic approaches. The idea of strengthening
patient’s immune system to fight cancer is of growing
interest for oncologists [28]. Our data indicate that
IL-27, a well-tolerated and toxicity-free cytokine [9] may

small necrotic foci of rapidly developing SCC, also express IL-27Rα (brown dots) (X630, inset at X1000).

Tumor responsiveness to IL-27, however, is the
prerequisite for its entry into clinical trials. Most AC and
SCC express IL-27R, and those with N1 involvement are
often endowed with higher expression levels. Dibra et al.
observed that WSX-1 expression in tumors induces immune
tolerance exerting pro-tumorigenic functions, independently
from IL-27 [45]. Our data, drawn from patient samples,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest that IL-27 may be used to overcome this drawback
and be of particular benefit in advanced lung cancer stages.
The myeloid cell mediated anti-lung cancer effects of IL27 may be exerted in humans, since in our samples IL-27R
is not only expressed by cancer cells, and microvessels,
but also by CD15+ granulocytes, CD68+ monocytes/
macrophages and CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells scattered

in the stroma or arranged in TLS. TLS have been associated
with a favorable clinical outcome in NSCLC [26, 27] and
IL-27 may promote, in these lymphoid structures, an
efficient adaptive antitumor immunity.
Altogether, our results highlight novel aspects
of IL-27’s antitumor potential, specifically in NSCLC,
such as the ability I. to drive myeloid cells towards
antitumor activities, and II. down-regulate stemness genes,
particularly in SCC cells, thus suppressing their selfrenewal potential. IL-27 may thus be proposed for clinical
trials with the prospect of its clinical use in immunedefective or advanced NSCLC patients.

and 25 SCC (10/25 with N1 involvement). Our panel
of 20 premalignant and 58 malignant lesions [47, 48],
and patient’s clinic-pathological characteristics [48, 49]
are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Normal lung tissue was
obtained from both lung cancer patients and control
patients operated for other reasons. Sample collection and
processing are described in the Supplementary information.

Cell culture and flow cytometry
Human lung SCC cell lines, Calu-1 and SK-MES,
and AC cell lines, Calu-6, GLC82 and A549 (ATCC
cell bank) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS
(Seromed Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany). HrIL-27 (R&D
System, Abingdon, UK) was used at 100 ng/ml following
titration experiments. Details on the assessment of IL-27R
expression, tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis by flow
cytometry are provided in the Supplementary information.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Animal experiments were performed at the IRCCS
“San Martino” National Institute for Cancer Research,
Genoa, in keeping with the National and International
regulations (Italian Legislative Order 27/01/1992, n.116,
European Economic Community Council Directive
86/609, OJL 358, Dec. 1, 1987). For studies on human
tissues, written informed consent was obtained from
patients. The study was approved by the Ethical
Committee of the “G. d’Annunzio” University of Chieti
(Italy), and Local Health Authority No.2, in the report
n.14 of 19/07/2012, and performed in accordance with the
principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Assessment of angiogenesis, stemness- and EMTrelated gene expression by real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from Calu-6 and SK-MES cells
cultured for 24 hours in the presence or absence of hrIL27, using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).
Contaminant genomic DNA was removed by DNase
treatment (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, D). RNA was reversetranscribed with the RT2 First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit
(SABioscience, Frederick, MD, USA). Experiments are
described in the Supplementary information.

Patients and samples
Premalignant and malignant lung samples were
obtained from 78 untreated patients with operable NSCLC
staged IA–IIIA according to the pTNM system [46].
NSCLC consisted of 33 AC (12/33 with N1 involvement)

We used the P.A.L.M. Micro Beam System
(Bernried, Germany) for LCM of frozen sections from
normal human lung, AC, and SCC samples. We selected

EMT-related
genes

Assessment of cytokine, Nestin and E-cadherin expression, and counts of microvessels, immune cells, TUNEL positive
cells, stemness and EMT-related gene expressing cells were performed at X400 in a 0.180 mm2 field. At least 3 samples
(three sections/sample), and 6–8 (depending on the tumor width) randomly chosen fields/section were evaluated. Results
are expressed as mean ± SD of CD31 positive microvessels per field; or RB6-8C5 (granulocytes) or CD11b/CD18
(macrophages) positive cells per field; or as mean ± SD percentage of TUNEL positive cells, or stemness- or EMT-related
gene expressing cells evaluated on paraffin embedded sections by immunohistochemistry. *The expression of cytokines,
Nestin and E-Cadherin was defined as absent (─); scarce (±); distinct (+) or strong (++) on paraffin embedded (CXCL3,
IFNγ, Nestin and E-Cadherin) or frozen (TNFα) sections stained with the corresponding Ab. †Values significantly different
(P < 0.05) from corresponding values in tumors developed in PBS-treated mice. ‡ND, not detected.

Statistical analysis

stemness and EMT-gene expressing cells between tumors
from hrIL-27- and PBS-treated mice were assessed by
Student’s t test, and data were reported as mean ± standard
deviation (SD). Between-group differences in the relative

Fisher’s exact test was used to examine the
association between IL-27Rα protein expression, evaluated
by immunohistochemistry, in primary lung tumors,
and clinic-pathological characteristics. The Spearman
rank correlation coefficient (ρ) was used to examine the
correlation between immunohistochemical staining and
