Abstract
Cancer immunosurveillance relies on effector/memory tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells with a T-helper cell 1
(TH1) proﬁle. Evidence for a natural killer (NK) cell-based control of human malignancies is still largely missing.
The KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate markedly prolongs the survival of patients with
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) by direct effects on tumor cells as well as by indirect immunostimulatory effects on T and NK cells. Here, we investigated the prognostic value of tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) expressing CD3, Foxp3, or NKp46 (NCR1) in a cohort of patients with localized GIST. We found that CD3þ
TIL were highly activated in GIST and were especially enriched in areas of the tumor that conserve class I MHC
expression despite imatinib mesylate treatment. High densities of CD3þ TIL predicted progression-free
survival (PFS) in multivariate analyses. Moreover, GIST were inﬁltrated by a homogeneous subset of cytokinesecreting CD56bright (NCAM1) NK cells that accumulated in tumor foci after imatinib mesylate treatment. The
density of the NK inﬁltrate independently predicted PFS and added prognostic information to the Miettinen
score, as well as to the KIT mutational status. NK and T lymphocytes preferentially distributed to distinct areas
of tumor sections and probably contributed independently to GIST immunosurveillance. These ﬁndings
encourage the prospective validation of immune biomarkers for optimal risk stratiﬁcation of patients with
GIST. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3499–510. 2013 AACR.

Rusakiewicz et al.

Indeed, 70% to 80% of GIST harbor an oncogenic mutation
in the type III receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, leading to ligandindependent receptor homodimerization and consequent
kinase activation. The most common mutations of KIT (in
two thirds of cases) are in-frame deletions, insertions, substitutions, or combinations, thereof, affecting the juxtamembrane domain encoded by exon 11. In particular, deletions
involving codon 557/558 are associated with a shorter eventfree and overall survival (7). Among the GIST-bearing wildtype (WT) KIT, 5% to 8% exhibit activating mutations of
PDGFRA affecting its juxtamembrane domain (encoded by
exon 12), the ATP-binding domain (encoded by exon 14) or
the activation loop (encoded by exon 18; ref. 8). GIST lacking
either KIT or PDGFRA mutations called "wild-type GIST" are
heterogeneous and harbor mutations in NF1, BRAF, RAS, or
genes encoding subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase
complex (9).
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate was ﬁrst
administered to a GIST-bearing patient in 2001 (5). Imatinib
mesylate inhibits KIT by directly binding to the ATP-binding
site within the N-terminal lobe of the kinase, stabilizing the
kinase in its inactive conformation (10). To date, the median
survival of patients with advanced GIST treated with ﬁrstline imatinib mesylate is 5 years and 34% of the patients
survive more than 9 years (11, 12). In addition, adjuvant
imatinib mesylate decreases the risk of relapse after resection of a localized GIST (6). However, even long-term imatinib mesylate treatment fails to eradicate GIST cells in both
advanced and localized adjuvant settings, perhaps because
imatinib mesylate has mostly cytostatic effects or because
GIST stem cells do not require KIT signaling for their
survival (13). Moreover, continuous imatinib mesylate exposure can lead to the selection imatinib mesylate–resistant
tumor cells with secondary KIT mutations (14). An important research goal is to develop new inhibitors interfering
with secondary activation loop mutations or targeting new
metabolic pathways relevant for distinct subtypes of GIST
(such as succinate dehydrogenase-deﬁcient tumors).
Another potential strategy consists if mobilizing the
immune system against GIST during/after imatinib mesylate
therapy. Indeed, immunostimulatory bystander or off-target
effects of distinct cytotoxic compounds reportedly contribute to their anticancer effects (15). We found that imatinib
mesylate can promote a KIT-dependent cross-talk between
dendritic and natural killer (NK) cells, leading to IFN-g
production by NK lymphocytes, both in mice and in humans
(16). Importantly, in advanced GIST, NK cell activation
following 2 months of imatinib mesylate treatment constituted a favorable independent predictive factor (17). Moreover, alternative splicing of exon 4 of the NKp30 gene
affecting the signaling of the NK-speciﬁc NKp30 protein
determined the prognosis of patients with metastatic GIST
treated with imatinib mesylate (18). Beyond NK cells, T cells
may inﬂuence the course of GIST. Balachandran and colleagues reported the discovery that, in mouse GIST models,
the antitumor effects of imatinib mesylate relied on the
contribution of CD8þ T lymphocytes (19). Thus, inhibition of
oncogenic KIT by imatinib mesylate in tumor cells could

3500

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

shut down the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
(IDO), thereby promoting the apoptosis of regulatory
Foxp3þ T cells and permitting the activation of tumor
inﬁltrating effector lymphocytes (19).
Very few studies have addressed the immune inﬁltrate of
GIST (20, 21). Using systematic immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and ﬂow-cytometric analyses, we discovered that primary
GIST are inﬁltrated by activated NK cells and CD3þ T cells.
However, the 2 lymphocytes subsets were not localized in the
same tumor areas and inﬂuenced progression free-survival
independently from currently used prognostic parameters
(Miettinen score or KIT mutations) in multivariate analyses.

Materials and Methods
Patients and specimens
The immunohistochemical study was carried out on a total
of 91 parafﬁn-embedded GIST specimen [67 from the localized
GIST cohort (57 no imatinib mesylate; 10 post-imatinib mesylate) and 24 from the metastatic GIST cohort (10 no imatinib
mesylate; 14 post-imatinib mesylate)]. Patients' characteristics
are depicted in Supplementary Table S1. The immunomonitoring studies on fresh tumors were prospectively conducted
on 14 patients with GIST (9 at diagnosis and 5 post-imatinib
mesylate) and 6 patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS)
enrolled for surgery (Supplementary Table S2). Patients' samples were provided by the Gustave Roussy Institute (Villejuif,
France), the University Hospital Virgen de las Nieves (Granada,
Spain), the Leon Berard Centre (Lyon, France), the Bergonie
Institute (Bordeaux, France), the University Hospital Jean
Minjoz (Besançon, France), and the University Hospital
Dupuytren (Limoges, France). An informed written consent
was obtained from patients according to the local ethical
committee. Heparinized blood was drawn from patients before
surgery for the immunomonitoring study. Clinical responses
were assessed by computed tomography scan and the responses were classiﬁed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.
Study approval
Study with GIST and STS specimen was approved by the local
Ethic Committee (2007-A00923-50) with written informed consent received from patients.
GIST tumor dissociation and ﬂow cytometry
Fresh tumors were dissociated within 12 hours postsurgery
following the gentle MACS Dissociator protocol (Miltenyi).
Brieﬂy, resected tumors were cut into small pieces, placed in
tube C with the dissociation buffer (RPMI-1640, 100 U penicillin/streptomycin, 50 U/mL Collagenase IV, 30 U/mL DNAse,
and 280 U/mL hyaluronidase), and processed with the
h_tumor_01 program on the gentle MACS dissociator. The
resulting cell suspension was ﬁltered through a 70-mm cell
strainer (BD Biosciences), washed in PBS and cell viability was
estimated by Hayem Blue. Tumor cell suspensions were analyzed by 12-color ﬂow cytometry and NK cells were deﬁned as
CD45þCD3CD56þ and tumor cells as CD45CD34þKITþ. The
NK receptor and tumor ligand antibodies included in this study
are listed in Supplementary Table S3. Cells were incubated with

conjugated antibodies for 20 minutes at 4 C, washed and ﬁxed
with 1% paraformaldehyde.
For intracellular cytokine staining, patients' PBMC and
tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were seeded in 96-round
bottom plates at 1  105 cells per well in RPMI þ 10% AB serum
with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycine (10
ng/mL and 250 ng/mL, respectively; Calbiochem) plus Golgi
Stop (4 mL/6 mL; BD Bioscience) for 2 hours at 37 C. Cells were
ﬁxed and permeabilized with Fix/Perm reagents (eBioscience)
following manufacturer's protocol. Stained cells were acquired
within 24 hours on Cyan Flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter)
and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).

(106 mol/L) was either added or not added and cells were
incubated for 24 hours. Tumor cell viability was assessed by
Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and the expression
of NK cell ligands was monitored with the antibodies listed in
Supplementary Table S3. In some experiments, imatinib mesylate–treated tumor cell lines (TF417 and TF816) were incubated with healthy volunteers' enriched NK cells (Easy Sep kit;
STEMCELL Technologies) at a ratio 1:5 to monitor CD107a
membrane expression by ﬂow cytometry, following 5 hours of
incubation with 2 mL of anti-CD107a-PE and 10 mmol/L Golgi
Stop (BD Biosciences) as well as IFN-g production by commercial ELISA (BD Biosciences) following 24 hours incubation.

Immunohistochemical staining
Parafﬁn-embedded GIST specimen were assessed for the
inﬁltration by NK, CD3, CD8, Foxp3þ cells, and HLA class I
positivity (EMR8-5) with the antibodies listed in Supplementary Table S3. Brieﬂy, 3-mm thick sections of formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn–embedded GIST specimen were mounted on poly-Llysine–coated slides, deparafﬁnized for antigen retrieval and
then rehydrated through graded alcohols to water. Retrieval
buffers consisted of Tris–EDTA buffer (10 mmol/L Tris and 1
mmol/L EDTA) pH 9 for NKp46, pH 8 for CD8 staining; 0.01
mol/L citrate buffer pH 10 for Foxp3 and pH 7 for EMR8-5.
Slides were incubated for 30 minutes in a 98 C water bath.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited with 3% hydrogen peroxidase (Dako) for 10 minutes and nonspeciﬁc protein
were blocked for 15 minutes (Protein Block; Dako). The primary antibody was incubated for 1 hour, followed by the
secondary antibody, polymer-peroxidase for mouse (NKp46,
EMR8-5), or rabbit (CD3, CD8) monoclonal antibody (EnVision
System; Dako) or Novolink (NOVOCASTRA) for Foxp3, incubated for 45 minutes. Peroxidases were detected with 3-amino9-ethylcarbazole substrate (AEC; Vector Laboratories) for
NKp46 and CD8 or with diaminobenzidine-peroxidase substrate kit (Dako) and the sections were counterstained with
Harris's hematoxylin and dehydrated except for AEC substrate
(NKp46 and CD8) where the slides were mounted using
Glycergel (Dako). Negative controls were made by substituting
primary antibody with isotype controls. CD3 staining was
carried out on fully automated Ventana Benchmark XT system
(Roche Ventana) following manufacturers' recommendations.
Positive cells were counted in 10 random 200 ﬁelds in a
double-blinded fashion. For CD3 staining, slides were digitized
with a slide scanner (Nikon Supercoolscan 8000 ED) and
processed with Pix Cyt software enabling whole slide quantiﬁcation (22).

Statistical analyses
The Fisher exact test, the x2 test, the linear regression test,
and the parametric Wilcoxon test and the nonparametric
Mann–Whitney test were used for comparison of the different
groups. These statistical analyses were conducted with the
GraphPad Prism software version 5. The survival curves were
plotted according to the Kaplan–Meier method, and compared
using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox). Multivariate analyses were
conducted with SPSS 17.0 (IBM SPSS), using the Cox model.

NK/tumor cross-talk in vitro
TF-1 erythroleukemic cell line engineered to express human
KIT gene either resistant (hKIT D816V or TF816, exon 17) or
sensible (hKITD417/8þD419Y or TF417, exon 11) to imatinib
mesylate (kindly provided by Dr. P. Dubreuil, Institut PaoliCalmettes, Marseille, France; ref. 23) were cultivated in RPMI
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA), 1% penicillin/
streptomycin and 2 mmol/L glutamine. A total of 5  105
tumor cell lines (TF417, TF816, and GIST 888) were seeded in
24-well plate overnight. The following day, imatinib mesylate

Results
NK cell inﬁltrates in GIST
We conducted a retrospective immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of 57 localized and 10 metastatic GIST at
diagnosis (imatinib mesylate–free; Supplementary Table S1)
using antibodies directed against CD3, Foxp3, and NKp46
aimed at identifying T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells (Treg),
and NK cells, respectively. The NKp46-speciﬁc staining resided
in ﬁbrous trabeculae (Fig. 1A, left and Fig. 1B), whereas CD3and Foxp3þ cells were mostly localized in tumor foci (Fig. 1A,
middle and right). The primary tumor of metastatic GIST
exhibited similar patterns of TILs (Fig. 1A). There was no
signiﬁcant correlation between the numbers of T, Tregs, and
NK cells (Fig. 1C and D). In the absence of imatinib mesylate
therapy, harboring a KIT exon 11 mutation or a high Miettinen
score is associated with dismal prognosis (24). In localized
GIST, NK TILs were 3 times less frequent in GIST bearing a
KIT exon 11 mutation than in WT GIST (Fig. 1E, left; median of
6 vs. 21/ﬁeld, respectively; P ¼ 0.06). In addition, localized GIST
with low/intermediate Miettinen risk were enriched in
NKp46þ (but not CD3þ) cells and lacked Foxp3þ cells at
diagnosis compared with high Miettinen risk GIST (Fig. 1F,
left, P ¼ 0.04; and right, P ¼ 0.01, respectively). When dissecting
the 3-digit Miettinen score, we identiﬁed NKp46þ cells to be
signiﬁcantly associated with a low mitotic index and a stomach
localization (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B, left; P ¼ 0.04
and 0.01, respectively), whereas the frequency of CD3þ cells
inversely correlated with tumor size (Supplementary Fig. S1C,
middle and right).
To investigate the functional phenotype of NK TILs, we
conducted a comprehensive ﬂow cytometry analysis of NK
cells puriﬁed from 14 freshly harvested and dissociated localized GIST tumors (9 at diagnosis and 5 post-imatinib mesylate), comparing them with autologous circulating NK cells or
to NK cells puriﬁed from 6 STS (Supplementary Table S2). GIST

histochemical analyses of a total of 42 localized GIST (surgery
alone or followed by adjuvant imatinib mesylate, n ¼ 32;
neoadjuvant imatinib mesylate followed by surgery, n ¼ 10)
using the EMR8.5 antibody speciﬁc for a nonpolymorphic
epitope of the heavy chain of MHC class I molecules. Although
most GIST at diagnosis homogeneously express MHC class I
molecules, up to 30% GIST fully lost MHC class I expression
upon imatinib mesylate and 40% GIST became partially (in
areas) MHC class I–negative (Fig. 4A; P ¼ 0.008). Importantly,
T cells tended to accumulate in MHC class I–positive tumors
(Fig. 4B, left; P ¼ 0.03) and areas (Fig. 4C), but disappeared from
MHC class I–negative tumors or areas (Fig. 4B, left and Fig. 4C).
In contrast, NK cells were not enriched in MHC class I–
negative tumors or areas (Fig. 4B, right). The immunohistochemical results were corroborated by ﬂow cytometry gating
on CD45KITþCD34þ cells in 9 GIST at diagnosis and 5 GIST
after in vivo exposure to imatinib mesylate. The level of
expression of MHC class I molecules was higher in GIST at
diagnosis compared with GIST treated with neoadjuvant imatinib mesylate [mean ratio mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI)
staining/MFI isotype control: 11  4 vs. 2  1, respectively; Fig.
4D; P ¼ 0.042], whereas no signiﬁcant difference was observed
for MHC class II, HLA-E, or MICA/B expression (Fig. 4D). When
analyzing the clinical outcome of the 10 patients with neoadjuvant GIST enrolled in this study, we found MHC class I loss
variants in all (4 of 4) patients that were disease-free at 7 years
postdiagnsosis, whereas only half of the patients (3 of 6)
relapsing or dying of their disease manifested loss of MHC
class I expression.

with little interindividual or intraindividual (pre- vs. post-imatinib mesylate) variations as most GIST NK TIL were CD3
CD56bright CD94þNKp80þCD16NKG2ACD158 (Fig. 2F and
G; but expressed variable levels of NKp30/CXCR3/CX3CR1) cells
(Fig. 2G). In STS, NK TILs were not only rare but also CD3
CD56dim CD16þ and low in the expression of CD94 and NKp80
(Fig. 2G).
Altogether, GIST differ from other sarcomas in thus far that
their TIL are enriched in activated CD56bright NK cells that are
devoid of inhibitory receptors and are localized at the tumor
borders. Moreover, GIST TILs contained activated TH1 cells
invading tumor foci.
Imatinib therapy is associated with MHC class I loss
variants and NK cell penetration into tumor foci
We next analyzed the effects of imatinib mesylate therapy
on GIST TIL. Patients received 400 mg imatinib mesylate
daily for an average time of 10.7 months. Although the density
of NKp46 inﬁltrates did not change in ﬁbrous trabeculae
(Fig. 3A and B), the frequency of NKp46þ cells inﬁltrating the
core of localized or metastatic GIST increased after imatinib
mesylate treatment (Fig. 3B, right; P ¼ 0.004 for localized and
P ¼ 0.001 for metastatic GIST). In contrast, Foxp3þ cells
signiﬁcantly decreased, whereas CD3þ cell numbers did not
change (Fig. 3C and D). Hence, the ratio NKp46/Foxp3 in the
tumor nests markedly increased by 4-fold after imatinib
mesylate.
Because both T and NK cell education and activation are
dictated by MHC class I molecules, we conducted immuno-

MHC class I or B7-H6 expression (Fig. 4E). No correlation
between the susceptibility of the target to imatinib mesylate
and the NK cell effector functions could be observed (Fig. 4F).
We conclude that long-term treatment with imatinib mesylate is associated with a progressive loss of MHC class I
molecules on GIST cells, as well as with an increase of NK
cells inﬁltration into the core of the tumor.

the mutational status of KIT did signiﬁcantly inﬂuence PFS.
Combining NK and T-cell scores allowed for the identiﬁcation of
a subgroup of 24% of patients that were NKp46lowCD3low and
had a dismal prognosis (Fig. 5D; P ¼ 0.0005).
Stratiﬁcation of patients with GIST based on the oncogenic KIT mutation and the NKp46 score identiﬁed a subset
of 10% of patients that were KITwt NKp46low (33% of all KIT
WT GIST) with a particularly high relapse rate regardless of
imatinib mesylate adjuvant therapy (Fig. 6A; P ¼ 0.006).
Moreover, stratiﬁcation of patients with GIST based on the

all exon 11–mutated GIST) with a particularly high relapse
rate regardless of imatinib mesylate adjuvant therapy (Fig.

an impact on survival with a 5-year median of PFS for
patients bearing a high score, whereas PFS was unreached
for patients with GIST with Miettinenlow/intermediate score
(Fig. 6C; P ¼ 0.006). Combining both Miettinen and NKp46
parameters, we identiﬁed a subgroup of patients (about one

half of patients with Miettinenhigh GIST) presenting with a
Miettinenhigh NKp46high score and a reduced relapse rate,
similar to patients with Miettinenlow/intermediate scores
(Fig. 6D; P < 0.0001), regardless of imatinib mesylate adjuvant therapy (given that 7 of 11 patients underwent surgery
only). In contrast, patients with GIST with a Miettinenhigh
and NKp46low score exhibited a short PFS (0.91 year vs. 5
years for high Miettinen score alone; Fig. 6D), independently
of adjuvant-imatinib mesylate therapy (given that 53% of
Miettinenhigh NKp46low underwent surgery followed by adjuvant imatinib mesylate therapy). The CD3 score also affected
the fate of high Miettinenhigh GIST in thus far that a subset of
22% GIST (harboring a Miettinenhigh CD3low score) had a
dismal prognosis (Fig. 6E; P < 0.0001). Thus, in localized
GIST, both the CD3þ and NKp46þ inﬁltrates can be considered as independent prognostic factors that add relevant
information to the classical Miettinen score with regard to
the PFS. Overall survival was also analyzed (Table 1). Given
the limited follow-up and the size of the cohort, no significant correlation with immune inﬁltrates was observed.

Discussion
This report represents, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst description of a tumor type that seems to be controlled by a natural
immunosurveillance system that involved both T and NK cells.
We found that imatinib promotes the reduction of MHC class I
expression by tumor cells (which theoretically may reﬂect a
T cell–based immunoediting process) and a relocation of NK
cells to the core of the tumor. Finally, NK and T-cell inﬁltrates
were both independently associated with PFS and may cooperate in addition with tumor cell-intrinsic parameters (featured by the Miettinen score) to inﬂuence the clinical outcome
of GIST.
Since the pioneering observation describing an inverse
correlation between NK cell cytotoxicity and cancer incidence
(25), many independent groups reported that intratumoral NK
cell inﬁltrates in solid tumors are rare, anergic, or irrelevant.
Using tumor tissue microarrays, Sconocchia and colleagues
found that 71% of melanomas, 97% of breast cancers, 92% of
renal cell carcinoma, and 92% of hepatocellular carcinomas
contained no CD56þ cell inﬁltrate, and similar results were
obtained using anti-NKp46 or anti-CD57 antibodies (26). Erdag
and colleagues corroborated these data showing that metastatic melanoma are devoid of NK cells and are rather inﬁltrated by T and B cells (27). Platonova and colleagues carefully
studied the proﬁle of NK TILs in early-stage non–small cell lung
cancers. Few NK cells were observed in the invasive margin,
mostly CD56dim that exhibited reduced levels of activating
receptors (NKp30, NKp80, CD16, and DNAM-1) and a
decreased degranulation and cytokine secretion (28). These
ﬁndings were in accordance with other observations in
similar cancer types even though in some instances, NK
cells were enriched in CD56bright cells (29, 30). In human
papillomavirus (HPV)-related tumors, such as cervix carcinoma and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions,
loss of NCR expression on NK cells correlated with their
weak cytotoxicity, HPV-16 infection, and advanced clinical
stage (31). Even in breast cancers that are prone to be
controlled by NK cells (32) and contain NK TILs enriched in
CD56bright cells, NK TILs exhibited low expression of NCR
and defective functions [antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC), cytokine release, and degranulation]
that inversely correlated with the Nottingham prognostic
index and upregulated NKG2A inhibitory receptors (33). In
contrast, in kidney cancers, high NK TIL content was
associated with high CD16 expression on NK cells but low
cytotoxic function after ex vivo reactivation using interleukin (IL)-2 or NKp46 stimulation (34). More importantly, the
presence of intratumoral NK cells was not associated with
clinical outcome at early stages of lung (28) and colon (26)
cancers.
So, what might be the reason why GIST fail to tolerize
NK cells? Chronic NK cells receptor (NKR) ligand stimulation by tumor cells may account for the downregulation of
DNAM1 or NKG2D on NK cells and perturbed NK TIL
functions, as this has been shown for breast and ovarian
cancers (33, 34). GIST cells failed to express most of the NKR
ligands at diagnosis (Fig. 4D), which may explain that NK
cells conserve high expression of NKR. Moreover, our high

3508

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

content multiplex cytokine/chemokine array analysis on
fresh GIST (not shown) conﬁrmed the local secretion of
stem cell factor and stem cell growth factor (35, 36), which
both could contribute to in situ homeostasis or differentiation of NK TILs.
Does oncogene inhibition (through imatinib mesylate) contribute to strengthening NK cell immunosurveillance against
GIST? Even though imatinib mesylate treatment leads to MHC
class I loss in vivo, it is unlikely that the imatinib mesylate
effects are cell-autonomous and result in enhanced target cell
recognition by NK TILs, for several reasons. First, WT KIT GIST
are particularly enriched in NK cells (Fig. 1E). Second, incubation of imatinib mesylate–sensitive versus imatinib mesylate–resistant KIT transduced tumor cells in the presence of
imatinib mesylate did not reveal the capacity of imatinib
mesylate to modulate degranulation or cytokine release (Fig.
4F). However, as for p53-dependent senescence (37), KIT
inactivation by imatinib mesylate may modulate chemokine
release, speciﬁcally during the dialogue between NK cells and
KIT-expressing tumor cells. Of note, the Cxcl9 and Cxcl10
gradients were inversed by imatinib mesylate treatment from
an initial preference for the peripheral stroma to a later
preference for the tumor core (S. Rusakiewicz; unpublished
data), and this may contribute to the intratumoral homing of
NK TILs. Moreover, KIT inhibition might reduce IDO concentrations, thereby reversing the intratumoral accumulation of
Foxp3þ cells (Fig. 3D; ref. 19), and hence unleash NK cell
effector functions (38).
Which immune biomarker does prevail as a prognostic
biomarker in the course of GIST treated with ﬁrst-line
imatinib mesylate therapy? In contrast to STS, GIST are
heavily inﬁltrated by leukocytes composed of all 3 subsets
(CD4, CD8, and NK) and relatively low numbers of Foxp3þ
CD4þ T cells (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 19). NK TIL
accumulation may, at least in part, be driven through cellautonomous features, given its signiﬁcant association with
the Miettinen score (gastric localization and low mitotic
index; Fig. 1F, left; Supplementary Fig. S1) and the WT status
of KIT gene (Fig. 1E, left). Nevertheless, NK cell inﬁltrates
represent an independent prognostic factor that adds prognostic information to the Miettinen score for optimally
resected primary GIST (Figs. 5 and 6). NKp30 is the only
NKR to be downmodulated on local and circulating NK cells,
and the expression of functionally distinct NKp30 isoforms
dictates PFS after imatinib mesylate therapy (18). In addition, T cells seem to play a major role in the immunosurveillance of GIST harboring exon 11 mutations. The Foxp3
inﬁltrates (as measured in IHC) were positively correlated
with the high-risk Miettinen score (Fig. 1F, right) and to a
lesser extent with the mutational status (exon 11 mutations
of KIT; Fig. 1E, right). The Foxp3 inﬁltrates strongly
decreased post-imatinib mesylate (Fig. 3D). Foxp3þ cells
were as frequent in primary as in metastatic lesions (Fig.
1A, right and 3D). These data are in accordance with
Balachandran and colleagues (19) showing that imatinib
mesylate treatment (mainly in GIST harboring KIT exon
11 mutations) was accompanied by Treg apoptosis secondary to the reduction of IDO. When we analyzed the

prognostic value of Foxp3 inﬁltrates in our cohort, we found
that intratumoral Treg numbers were not associated with
PFS in primary GIST. However, when stratifying the patients
according to the absence or presence of adjuvant imatinib
mesylate treatment postsurgery, we found that the accumulation of Foxp3þ cells and the loss of NKp46þ cells were both
negative predictors of imatinib mesylate responses but were
not prognostic markers (not shown). Further investigations
on larger cohorts will be required to validate these data.
Given that CD3þ T-cell inﬁltrates represent an independent
prognostic marker for PFS in localized GIST, it is tempting to
speculate that they may shape the tumor microenvironment
at early stages (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. S1, S5, and S6;
Supplementary Table 2). Given that both T and NK subsets
did not colocalize within the same areas of the tumor (Figs.
1A and B and 3B and C), did not correlate in the frequency
with each other (Fig. 1C) and added prognostic values to
different mutations (Figs. 5 and 6), we postulate that they
should be considered as cooperating, yet independent factors that both inﬂuence the clinical outcome of localized
GIST.
What are the current recommendations for assessing the
risk of relapse after resection of a primary localized GIST? They
are based on 5 parameters: tumor size, tumor location, mitotic
index (24), mutational status of GIST (39), and more recently
tumor rupture during surgery (40). However, new predictors
are currently being investigated, taking into account the
accumulation of chromosomal aberrations (41–43), the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, the codeletion
of the gene coding for the methylthio-adenosine phosphorylase, and the downregulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27 (44–
46). Prospective studies must evaluate the predictive role of T
and NK cell inﬁltrates and to correlate them with the
aforementioned intrinsic features of GIST. On the basis of
the results obtained in this limited series of patients, we
anticipate that the accurate quantiﬁcation of the density and
function of distinct lymphocyte subsets will reﬁne current
methods of risk stratiﬁcation in GIST and hence possibly

guide therapeutic decisions, including those affecting present and future immunotherapies.
