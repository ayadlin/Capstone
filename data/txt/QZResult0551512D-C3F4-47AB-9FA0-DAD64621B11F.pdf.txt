BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with a poor prognosis, particularly in older
patients. To the authors’ knowledge, few population-based studies of AML treatment patterns and outcomes
exist to date. METHODS: The authors used the Ontario Cancer Registry to identify all patients diagnosed with
AML between 1965 and 2003. Referral to specialized cancer centers (SCCs) and receipt of chemotherapy
were examined as quality of care indicators. Survival outcomes were examined using logistic regression at 30
days, 1 year, and 3 years. RESULTS: A total of 9365 patients (mean age, 58.1 years; range, 0 to 103 years)
developed AML between 1965 and 2003. Overall, 75.1%, 32.9%, and 17.3% of patients survived to 30 days, 1
year, and 3 years, respectively. Although survival improved over time among patients aged 19 to 59 years,
similar improvements were not seen among older patients. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy declined with age (59.0% vs 29.3% among patients ages 19-59 vs 60 years). Fewer patients aged 60
years were referred to a SCC compared with younger patients (20.8% vs 29.9%). Younger age, less comorbidity, later year of diagnosis, receipt of chemotherapy, and being referred to a SCC were associated with better
30-day and long-term survival in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prognosis has improved
over time among younger adults, it remains poor among those aged 60 years. Fewer older patients were
referred to SCCs or treated with chemotherapy compared with younger patients, whereas both factors were
associated with improved survival. Opportunities may exist to improve the quality of care and outcomes

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by abnormal proliferation of immature myeloid cells
with secondary hematopoietic insufficiency.1 AML incidence increases with age, with >60% of patients
being aged 60 years at diagnosis.2 Current treatment of AML consists of intensive chemotherapy with an
anthracycline and cytosine arabinoside.3
Several population-based studies have reported improvements in outcomes for younger people with
AML within the last 30 years.4,5 This is in contrast to older patients, generally referring to those aged 60

years, in whom the prognosis is poor and has remained
virtually unchanged over the past several decades.4 Even
in selected series, 3-year and 5-year survival rates among
older adults are reported to be only 10%6 and 5% to 8%,
respectively.7 The poor prognosis in older adults is
because of a combination of factors, including a larger
proportion of cases with adverse-risk cytogenetics and
other deleterious genetic and epigenetic changes,8-12
lower rates of achieving complete remission with intensive
chemotherapy,12 higher risk of disease recurrence after
achieving remission,6,13 greater comorbidity,14 inability
to tolerate conventional allogeneic bone marrow transplantation regimens,15 and other adverse prognostic factors.12,16 In part because of these aforementioned factors,
older adults with AML receive chemotherapy less often
than younger patients, and clinicians appear to be more
pessimistic with respect to the management and outcomes
for these patients than for their younger counterparts.17
In turn, lower levels of aggressive treatment of older adults
with AML may compound prognostic differences associated with disease biology.
The median overall survival of older patients with
AML was reported to be as low as 2 months in 1 population-based study.18 In contrast, several large randomized
trials and case series from major institutions have reported
1-year survival rates of 50%.19-21 A likely reason for the
discrepancy is referral bias of more medically fit and stable
patients to specialized institutions.22 An alternate possibility is the higher rate of aggressive treatment and highquality care of older patients with AML in specialized centers. However, to our knowledge, there are few high-quality, population-based studies of AML treatment patterns
to address this issue. Menzin et al studied 2657 patients
aged 65 years with AML using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data
between 1991 and 1996.18 The investigators found that
only 30% of patients received any chemotherapy within 2
years of diagnosis.18 In the only other community-based
study of AML, by Xie et al, using SEER data from 1974
to 1993,4 the 5-year survival rate was 30%, 13%, and 3%
for patients ages 20 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and 65
years, respectively, but receipt of chemotherapy was not
examined. More current data are needed to better understand the burden of AML, particularly among older
adults. In addition, AML is a relatively uncommon malignancy, and may benefit from specialized, regionalized
2904

care. Prior studies of AML have not reported on whether
referral patterns to specialized cancer centers vary with age
or other factors, or whether outcomes vary by treatment
center. Such variations, if they exist, may represent an important area for study to identify ways to enhance the care
of older adults with AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Overview
This was a retrospective analysis of provincial cancer registry
data for all patients with newly diagnosed AML between
1965 and 2003. The study received ethics approval from
the Research Ethics Board at the University Health Network. Because of the anonymized nature of the data,
requirements for individual patient consent were waived.

Study Database
The patient cohort was assembled from the Ontario Cancer
Registry (OCR). The OCR is the most comprehensive cancer database in Ontario. Data for the OCR are derived
from 4 main sources. First, hospital discharge abstract data
are received for all inpatient or same day surgery stays in every acute care hospital in Ontario for patients with cancer.
Second, information is received on the diagnosis and management of patients seen at all 9 specialized cancer centers
in Ontario. Third, the OCR collects patient information
from death certificates and pathological reports from all
Ontario hospitals. Nearly 90% of OCR cancer diagnoses
are histologically verified. However, results of cytogenetic
tests are not contained in the OCR. The OCR features
well-defined algorithms and trained data coding personnel
to ensure accurate capture rates.23 Finally, vital status information is obtained from the Registrar General’s office.
Treatment information on chemotherapy is available from 2 sources, including procedure codes from hospital stays captured in discharge abstracts and from
treatment at regional cancer centers. We followed the procedure of Menzin et al18 to define receipt of inpatient
chemotherapy using specific diagnostic and procedure
codes. This was combined with chemotherapy treatment
indicators from specialized cancer centers. Although these
indicators generally capture only intravenous chemotherapy, neither source allows reliable differentiation between

Patient Population
We included all patients with a first diagnosis of AML
(defined using International Classification of Disease
Ninth Edition codes 205.0, 206.0, or 207.0) between January 1, 1964 and December 31, 2003. Sociodemographic
information, all hospital separations, treatment information, and vital status information were obtained for each
patient. Comorbidity was measured using the CharlsonDeyo Index.24,25

Statistical Analyses
We used simple descriptive statistics to analyze the number of patients diagnosed in each 5-year period from 1965
to 2003. Analyses for outcomes, including survival, referral to a specialized cancer center, and receipt of chemotherapy, were assessed using multivariate logistic
regression models. These models evaluated several possible covariates, including age, sex, socioeconomic status
(neighborhood income quartile), comorbidity, health
planning, referral to a specialized cancer center, and
receipt of chemotherapy as appropriate. There are 8 health
planning regions across the province. Each 1 includes at
least 1 specialized cancer center, but regions vary in population density and geographic size. Region A had both the
highest overall population and the highest population
density. Regions B, C, G, and H had moderate population sizes and were a mix of primarily urban and suburban
regions. Regions D and E had relatively small populations
and large geographic sizes, consisting of mostly rural areas.
Region F was a mix of urban and suburban, but was the
second smallest in terms of population size. Analyses of
referral patterns were restricted to patients aged 19
years, because children with acute leukemia are treated in
specialized pediatric tertiary care hospitals.
We examined 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year survival.
Thirty-day survival reflects both disease severity and treatment-related toxicity. One-year and 3-year survival are
common benchmarks in AML trials. Potential predictor
variables were assessed in univariate logistic regression
models and included in multivariate models regardless of
P value, unless there were too few events to allow for

model stability. Goodness of fit for all logistic models was
assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic,26 and
model discrimination was evaluated with the c-statistic.
We repeated these analyses for patients diagnosed in 1995
onward, as the results are more reflective of the current
treatment era. Similar to our analyses of referral patterns,
all regression analyses of survival were restricted to
patients aged 19 years. However, we report raw estimates of 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year survival for patients
aged 0 to 18 years.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 9613 patients were diagnosed with AML during
the study period. The mean age at diagnosis was 58.2
years (median, 64 years; range, 0 to 103 years), with
53.5% male. Of the entire cohort, 6.9% were ages 0 to 18
years, 35.5% were ages 19 to 59 years, and 57.5% were
aged 60 years at diagnosis.
There was a steady increase in the number of newly
diagnosed cases per 5-year interval, from 491 cases
between 1965 and 1970 to 1814 cases between 1995 and
2000, predominantly among the patients aged 60 years
(Fig. 1). Mean age at diagnosis increased steadily over
time, from 49.1 years in 1965 to 62.5 years in 2003 (P <
.001 for linear trend).
The level of comorbidity increased with age group,
with a mean Charlson score of 0.27, 0.43, and 0.72 for
patients aged 0 to 18 years, 19 to 59 years, and 60 years,
respectively (P < .001). Similarly, the proportion of
patients with prior cancer increased from 9.5% for
patients aged 0 to 18 years to 11.2% and 15.8% for
patients aged 19 to 59 years and 60 years, respectively
(P < .001).

Referral Patterns and Receipt
of Chemotherapy
Overall, 39.2% of patients aged 19 years were referred
to a specialized cancer center. This proportion has changed
with time and differs by age group. Over time, the proportion of adult patients referred to a specialized cancer center
has increased from 27.9% in 1965 through 1970 to
52.2% for patients diagnosed in 2001 through 2003. This
increase was primarily seen in patients ages 19 to 59 years
(data not shown). There was a strong negative relation
between increasing age and likelihood of referral to a specialized cancer center, whether age was analyzed as a dichotomous variable (age 19-59 years vs age 60 years; P <
.001) or by decade (P < .001). This is illustrated in Figure 2. There was a weak relation noted between comorbidity and referral to a specialized cancer center, such that
patients with a Charlson score of 1, 2, 3, or higher had an
odds ratio of referral of 0.60 (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.51-0.72), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.81-1.05), and
0.82 (95% CI, 0.68-0.99) compared with patients with a
Charlson score of 0. There was no relation noted between
either sex (P ¼ .74) or income quartile (P ¼ .30) and referral to a specialized cancer center.
Overall, 41.7% of patients were treated with chemotherapy. Fewer patients aged 60 years received chemotherapy compared with patients ages 19 to 59 years
(29.3% vs 59.0%; P < .001). When age was considered
per decade, the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy decreased, particularly among those aged 60
years compared with younger patients (Table 1). There
was no relation noted between sex and receipt of chemotherapy (P ¼ .24). There were significant differences in
the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy by geographic region, ranging from 33.5% to 47.4% (Table 1).

cantly more likely to receive chemotherapy (62.0% vs
28.7%; P < .001), even after adjustment for age. Specifically, among patients ages 19 to 59 years, 73.0% of those
referred to a specialized cancer center received chemotherapy, as opposed to 43.0% who were not referred. Among
patients aged 60 years, the proportions were 49.5% versus 20.5%, respectively. Over time, there was an increase
in the proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy,

among both younger and older patients, reaching a plateau around 1995 for younger patients and a decade earlier for patients aged 60 years. This is illustrated in
Figure 3. When patients were restricted to those diagnosed in 1995 onward, the above differences persisted,
although absolute proportions treated with chemotherapy
increased in all categories (Table 1).
Survival
For the cohort as a whole, 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year survival rates were 75.1%, 32.9%, and 17.3%, respectively.
Across age groups, survival decreased with increasing age.
Among patients aged 0 to 18 years, 19 to 59 years, and
60 years, the 30-day survival was 90.1%, 84.9%, and
67.2%, respectively. One-year survival was 58.0%,
48.8%, and 20.1%, respectively, whereas 3-year survival
was 35.8%, 28.0%, and 8.4%, respectively. Over time,
there was a steady increase in 30-day and 1-year survival,
but this improvement was noted exclusively in younger
patients with no improvement in survival observed among
patients aged 60 years (Fig. 4).
Analyses of predictors of survival were restricted to
patients aged 19 years. On univariate analyses, predictors of 30-day mortality included age (P < .001), Charlson score (P < .001), referral to a specialized cancer center
(P < .001), receiving chemotherapy (P < .001), and geographic region (P < .001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of 30-day mortality
included age, Charlson score, prior cancer, referral to a
specialized cancer center, receipt of chemotherapy, and
geographic region (Table 2).
Univariate predictors of 1-year survival included age
(P < .001), sex (P ¼ .011), year of diagnosis (P < .001),

Charlson score (P < .001), prior cancer (P < .001), referral to a specialized cancer center (P < .001), and receiving
chemotherapy (P < .001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of 1-year mortality
included age, year of diagnosis, Charlson score, referral to
a specialized cancer center, and receipt of chemotherapy
(Table 2).
With respect to 3-year survival, univariate predictors
included age (P < .001), sex (P ¼ .018), year of diagnosis
(P < .001), Charlson score (P < .001), prior cancer (P <
.001), referral to a specialized cancer center (P < .001),
receipt of chemotherapy (P < .001), and geographic
region (P < .001). Significant predictors of 3-year survival
in multivariate logistic regression were age (P < .001),
year of diagnosis (P < .001), Charlson score (P < .001),
referral to a specialized cancer center (P < .001), receipt
of chemotherapy (P < .001), and geographic region (P <
.001) (Table 2). Model fit for all 3 multivariate models
was good, with c-statistics ranging from 0.75 to 0.77
(Table 2).

DISCUSSION
We examined patterns of care of AML using populationbased data spanning nearly 40 years. Our findings can be
summarized as follows. First, an increasing proportion of
patients with AML have been treated with chemotherapy

over time, particularly among people ages 19 to 59 years.
Second, several factors are associated with referral to a specialized cancer center and receipt of chemotherapy,
including age, comorbidity, and geographic region, but
not sex. Third, outcomes have been improving over time,
mostly among younger patients. Consistent predictors of
better survival at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years include
younger age, a later year of diagnosis, less comorbidity,
referral to a specialized cancer center, and receipt of
chemotherapy.
Before discussing these findings in detail, it is important to recognize several important limitations to our
analyses. First, the OCR does not contain information
regarding cytogenetics or other disease markers, nor does
it contain details regarding chemotherapy agent or dose.
As such, we can only make high-level comments about
referral patterns, treatment patterns, and outcomes. Second, administrative data do not include information concerning patient preferences. Many older patients, when
faced with the poor prognosis and significant toxicity of
intensive chemotherapy, may choose best supportive care.
Conversely, we cannot determine what proportion of
patients who did not receive chemotherapy was offered
this option by the treating physician. This is clearly an im2908

portant issue. Third, receipt of chemotherapy is likely to
be undercoded in our database, such that our observed
rates may be lower than in practice. In addition, we could
not separately capture receipt of transplantation, either
bone marrow or peripheral stem cell. However, undercoding of chemotherapy is not likely to change with age,
meaning that our observed age-based patterns of care are
likely to be robust. In addition, our results are remarkably
similar to studies using SEER-Medicare data.18,27 Moreover, our results for receipt of chemotherapy are also similar to Luke et al, who analyzed treatment and survival
patterns associated with myeloid leukemia in South Australia using hospital registry data.5 These results provide
some external validity for our findings. That being said,
given the limitations of the data, the current study should
be viewed as a first step to understanding patterns of care
among patients with AML. Regardless of concerns regarding undercoding of chemotherapy, our survival data are
robust and provide relatively current, population-based
survival data for this disease that complement data from
trials and cohort studies.
The current study also features several strengths.
First, it is a large, population-based analysis. Second, the
data are fairly current, and span nearly 40 years, providing
Cancer

Patterns of Care in AML/Alibhai et al

an almost-unparalleled opportunity to understand AML
over time. Third, there is universal healthcare insurance in
Ontario, which minimizes any economic impact on diagnosis, referral, or treatment patterns.
With respect to our main findings, we noted an
increase in the proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy over time, particularly among younger patients.
In an updated analysis of data originally published by
Menzin et al,18 Lang et al found similar results among
3439 older patients with AML using SEER-Medicare
data, with 29% of patients diagnosed in 1991 treated with
chemotherapy compared with 38% diagnosed in 1999.27
Luke et al reported an increase from 57.5% of patients of
any age with AML treated with chemotherapy between
1977 and 1986 to 85.8% for patients diagnosed between
1995 and 2002.5 However, these investigators used a
broad definition of chemotherapy, including agents such
as interferon and imatinib. By using a narrower definition
of chemotherapy, we found relatively little change in the
use of chemotherapy among patients aged 60 years
between 1985 and 2003. To our knowledge, there are no
other population-based analyses of treatment of AML.
The current study is the first, to our knowledge, to
analyze referral patterns to specialized cancer centers
among patients with AML. Similar to Lang et al27 and
Luke et al,5 we observed a decreasing proportion of cases
receiving treatment with increasing age. This was seen
regardless of year of diagnosis, and differences in the proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy persisted
regardless of whether patients were referred to a specialized cancer center. However, referral to a specialized cancer center was associated with higher proportions of
patients treated with chemotherapy regardless of age.
Perhaps the most provocative of our findings relate
to treatment outcomes and the role of a specialized cancer
center. Consistent with prior literature, we demonstrated
that older people with AML had a poorer short-term and
long-term prognosis compared with younger people.4,5,27
Comorbidity was consistently associated with a poorer
prognosis independent of age, receipt of treatment, and
other factors. The importance of comorbidity on survival
outcomes has been well recognized among other malignancies,28,29 and recently has been described among
patients with AML.30 In addition, receipt of chemotherapy was associated with improved short-term and longterm survival. Two factors may explain this observation.
Cancer

July 1, 2009

First, intensive chemotherapy is clearly associated with
improved survival in younger people with AML,31 and is
likely associated with improved outcomes among people
aged 60 years,19 although the latter point remains controversial, particularly among patients aged 70 years or
those with unfavorable cytogenetics.32,33 Receipt of
chemotherapy also included patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation, which is associated with improved
survival in several subgroups of patients.31 Second, selection bias may explain a component of the improved survival among patients treated with chemotherapy. This is
because patients who are more fit and have more favorable
disease characteristics are more likely to be treated. How
much of a role each of these 2 factors is playing in explaining the improved survival cannot be determined from our
data.
We also found referral to a specialized cancer center
was associated with improved short-term and long-term
outcomes, after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, year
of diagnosis, and receipt of chemotherapy. One possible
interpretation of this finding is that AML is a relatively
uncommon disease that requires specialized assessment
and treatment, similar to other complex malignant conditions for which regionalization of surgical care has been
recommended.34-36 A contributing factor is access to allogeneic transplantation, which is associated with improved
survival and is only available in specialized cancer centers.
Conversely, more healthy patients with better cytogenetics or other disease characteristics that make them more
likely to benefit from chemotherapy may be more likely
to be referred to specialized cancer centers. This selection
bias may explain the better outcomes seen among patients
at these centers. The effect of referral to a specialized cancer center, with odds ratios for improved survival ranging
from 1.29 to 2.35, are of potential clinical importance. At
the same time, effects of referral appear to be attenuated
over time, with less pronounced effects on 3-year survival
compared with 30-day survival (Table 2). In addition,
we were only able to partially adjust for differences in
patient characteristics and treatment by considering
comorbidity, a prior history of cancer, geographic region,
and receipt of chemotherapy in our models. As such, our
data must be viewed as hypothesis-generating, and further
analyses involving more detailed clinical and treatmentrelated information are required to understand these
factors.

We found that geographic region was generally not
a significant predictor of mortality, particularly beyond
30-day mortality. Geographic region was important in
several univariate models, but effects were attenuated in
multivariate models, suggesting that much of the impact
of geographic region is because of a combination of other
variables, such as age, referral to a specialized cancer center, and receipt of chemotherapy. Living in more rural
areas does not appear to be a major factor in determining
outcome after a diagnosis of AML, provided patients have
access to appropriate expertise.
In summary, the number of diagnosed cases of AML
has been rising in the past 40 years, primarily among
patients aged 60 years. Chemotherapy is being increasingly used in the treatment of AML, but utilization
remains lower among those aged 60 years. Survival has
been improving over time, particularly among younger
patients, and important predictors of better survival
include younger age, a more recent year of diagnosis, less
comorbidity, referral to a specialized cancer center, and
receipt of chemotherapy.
