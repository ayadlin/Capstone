BACKGROUND: The efficacy of carboplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab among recurrent glioblastoma (GBM)
patients after prior progression on bevacizumab therapy in a phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial was evaluated.
METHODS: Eligible patients received carboplatin (area under the plasma curve [AUC] 4 mg/ml-min) on day 1,
whereas bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and irinotecan (340 mg/m2 for patients on CYP3A enzyme-inducing anti-epileptics
[EIAEDs] and 125 mg/m2 for patients not on EIAEDs) were administered on days 1 and 14 of every 28-day cycle.
Patients were evaluated after each of the first 2 cycles and then after every other cycle. Treatment continued until
progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or voluntary withdrawal. The primary end point was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6), and secondary end points included safety and median overall survival
(OS). RESULTS: All patients had progression on at least 1 prior bevacizumab regimen and 56% enrolled after either
second or third overall progression. The median OS was 5.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-7.0 months)
and PFS-6 rate was 16% (95% CI, 5.0%-32.5%). The most common grade 3 or 4 events were hematologic and
occurred in 29% of cycles. Nine patients (38%) required dose modification. There were no treatment-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab was associated with modest activity and adequate safety

Outcome for glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor, remains poor with median
overall survival (OS) of only 14.6 months after current standard therapy that includes maximum safe resection followed
by involved-field radiation with temozolomide and adjuvant temozolomide.1 Salvage therapies after recurrence have had
limited activity.2-4 Initial clinical trials with bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody (MAb) against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were conducted among recurrent GBM patients because GBM tumors are highly angiogenic5,6 and secrete high levels of VEGF.7-9 In addition, VEGF targeting MAbs inhibit growth in in vivo orthotopic
GBM xenograft models10,11 and can enhance the antitumor activity of cytotoxic therapy.12-14 Furthermore, significant
clinical benefit associated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy had been noted in other aggressive solid tumors.15-20
Encouraging rates of radiographic response and improved survival reported by initial studies in recurrent GBM21,22 triggered follow-up studies, which ultimately led to accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of
single-agent bevacizumab based on durable radiographic responses.23-25
However, the survival benefit after bevacizumab with or without other systemic agents is modest with most patients
developing progressive disease within 8 to 10 months and dying from refractory tumor soon thereafter.22-24,26-30 Thus,
effective therapy for GBM patients after progression on bevacizumab-based therapy represents a major unmet need.

Original Article

Carboplatin and irinotecan exhibit modest antitumor activity when administered separately among recurrent malignant glioma patients.31-38 In addition, both
agents impair DNA replication via potentially complementary mechanisms and are associated with primarily
nonoverlapping toxicities. We therefore hypothesized that
a regimen combining carboplatin and irinotecan may be
adequately tolerated and associated with greater antitumor benefit than either agent alone. Studies evaluating
this regimen in other cancer populations were the basis for
the dosing schedule utilized in the current study. The rationale for continuing bevacizumab was to avoid rebound,
fulminant progressive tumor after bevacizumab discontinuation39 and to potentially normalize tumor vasculature
to allow enhanced chemotherapy delivery.40

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protocol Objectives
Our primary objective was to evaluate the activity, defined
by progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) of carboplatin and irinotecan combined with bevacizumab among
adults with recurrent GBM who progressed on prior bevacizumab therapy. In addition, we sought to evaluate the
safety of this regimen in this patient population.
Patient Eligibility
Patients were required to have histologic confirmation of
World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4 malignant
glioma (GBM or gliosarcoma) that progressed after prior
bevacizumab-based therapy. Patients with prior low-grade
glioma were eligible if histologic transformation to grade
4 malignant glioma was confirmed. Eligible patients were
also at least 18 years of age; had a Karnofsky performance
status (KPS) 70; and were on a stable corticosteroid
dose for at least 1 week. Additional enrollment criteria
included hematocrit >29%; absolute neutrophil count
>1000 cells/ll; platelet count >100,000 cells/ll; and serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin
within 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal.
At least 4 weeks between surgical resection or chemotherapy, and at least 12 weeks between radiotherapy and
enrollment were required. All patients provided informed
consent. There were no limits based on either the number
of prior episodes of progression or therapeutic regimens
received.
Patients were excluded for grade 3 toxicity on
prior bevacizumab; progressive disease or grade 3
toxicity on prior carboplatin or irinotecan; uncontrolled

5352

hypertension; acute hemorrhage on baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); urine protein:creatinine ratio >1;
homozygosity for the *28UGT1A1 allele; pregnancy or
nursing; active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics;
therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin; and prior stereotactic radiosurgery, radiation implants, or radiolabeled
monoclonal antibody therapy unless there was unequivocal disease progression (such as a new lesion or biopsyproven recurrence).
Treatment Design
Eligible patients for this open-label phase 2 study received
bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days.
Carboplatin was administered at an area under the plasma
curve (AUC) of 4 on day 1 of each 28-day cycle. Irinotecan was administered on days 1 and 14 at 340 mg/m2 for
patients receiving cytochrome P450 CYP3A enzymeinducing anti-epileptics (EIAEDs; phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and primidone) and
at 125 mg/m2 for those not on EIAEDs. Study therapy
continued until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
noncompliance with study protocol guidelines, or withdrawal of consent.
Response Evaluation
Study investigators determined response by neurologic examination and contrast-enhanced MRI after the first 2
treatment cycles and then prior to every other cycle based
on the recently published Response Assessment in NeuroOncology criteria.41 A complete response (CR) required
disappearance of all enhancing and nonenhancing tumor
on consecutive MRIs at least 4 weeks apart, with corticosteroid discontinuation and neurologic stability or
improvement. A partial response (PR) required 50%
reduction in size (product of largest perpendicular diameters) of enhancing tumor with stability or improvement of
neurologic status and corticosteroids. Progressive disease
(PD) included 25% increase of enhancing tumor, a new
enhancing lesion, significant worsening of nonenhancing
tumor including that detected by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or T2 sequences, or clinical
decline. Stable disease (SD) was defined as any assessment
not meeting CR, PR, or PD criteria. Partial responses and
stable disease also required stable or improved signal abnormality on FLAIR sequences.
Dose Modification and Retreatment Criteria
Chemotherapy doses were held for grade 3 or 4, related,
nonhematologic toxicity, grade 3 thrombocytopenia,

GBM Bevacizumab Failure Therapy/Reardon et al

grade 4 neutropenia, and fever and neutropenia (any
grade) until the event resolved to grade 1 or pretreatment
baseline. Thereafter, chemotherapy doses were reduced by
25%. Chemotherapy doses were also reduced by 25% for
any related event that required >2 weeks to satisfy retreatment criteria. Patients who required more than 3 chemotherapy dose reductions were allowed to remain in the
study and receive bevacizumab alone. Bevacizumab was
discontinued for uncontrollable hypertension, grade 2 or
greater hemorrhage, arterial thrombosis, wound dehiscence requiring surgical intervention, intestinal perforation or grade 4 venous thrombosis, proteinuria, or
congestive heart failure. Bevacizumab was held until other
related grade 3 events resolved to grade 1.
Initiation of each cycle required an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1000/mm3; a platelet count
100,000/mm3; creatinine 1.5 times the upper limit of
normal ( ULN), bilirubin 2  ULN and aspartate
aminotransferase 2.5  ULN; proteinuria <3Ã¾ on urinalysis or urine protein: creatinine ratio 1.0; and resolution of any related grade 3 event to grade 1.
Statistical Considerations
Our primary goal was to evaluate the PFS-6 rate of carboplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab among recurrent
GBM patients who had progressed on prior bevacizumab
therapy. At the time this study was designed, benchmarks
for outcome among recurrent GBM patients who had
progressed on prior bevacizumab therapy had not been
established; therefore, we chose to use the historical
benchmark established with temozolomide at first recurrence. Hence, given a PFS-6 rate of 21% among recurrent
GBM patients treated with temozolomide at first recurrence,42 a sample size goal of 24 recurrent GBM patients
was chosen to allow 88% power to differentiate between
PFS-6 rates of 5% and 25% with a type 1 error rate of
0.03.
An interim efficacy analysis after 16 patients were
accrued to each arm was planned a priori. If 12 or more of
these 16 patients progressed or died within 2 months of
study initiation, further accrual would be suspended. The
interim efficacy threshold was met, and therefore the
study completed accrual as specified.
For this study among heavily pretreated patients
with an extremely poor prognosis, rates of unacceptable
toxicity, defined as grade 2 central nervous system
(CNS) hemorrhage or grade 4 or 5 nonhematologic toxicity, of 15% or less were considered desirable, whereas rates
of 40% or greater were considered undesirable. Stopping

rules for unacceptable toxicity based upon boundaries
proposed by Pocock were used to monitor this study after
each group of 4 patients.43 Accrual was not suspended to
formally assess the toxicity profile unless the following
thresholds of unacceptable toxicity were satisfied: 3/4;
4/8; 5/12; 6/16; 7/20; 7/24. The type 1 and
type 2 errors associated with this monitoring were 0.05
and 0.07, respectively. These guidelines did not adjust for
differential length of follow-up of accrued patients.
PFS was defined as the time between the cycle 1 start
date and the date of disease progression or death. PFS was
censored at the time of last follow-up if the patient
remained alive without disease progression, or at the start
of nonstudy treatment if initiated before disease progression. OS was calculated from the start of therapy until
death or last contact if censored. PFS and OS were summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimator including 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Characteristics of the 25 patients who enrolled on this
study between September 2009 and July 2010 are summarized in Table 1. Patients were relatively young (median age, 52 years), more than half had a KPS of at least
90, and 10 (40%) were on corticosteroids at enrollment.
Patients were moderately pretreated with 14 (56%) having 2 to 3 episodes of prior progression. All patients had
progressed after standard therapy with radiation and
temozolomide chemotherapy as well as prior bevacizumab. Most patients (96%) had progressed on 1 prior bevacizumab regimen, whereas 1 patient enrolled after
progression on 2 prior bevacizumab regimens. Thirteen
patients (52%) enrolled after having progressed on bevacizumab used at recurrence, whereas 12 patients (48%) enrolled after progressing on bevacizumab incorporated into
adjuvant therapy for newly diagnosed GBM patients.
Sixty percent of patients progressed previously on bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy, whereas 36%
progressed on bevacizumab monotherapy and 1 patient
progressed on bevacizumab with a targeted agent (sorafenib). Nearly all patients (92%) enrolled while progressing
on bevacizumab therapy; however, 2 (8%) progressed on
bevacizumab and then received either single-agent temozolomide or XL-184, a dual VEGFR-2/met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for 2 to 4 months prior to study
enrollment. Median duration of initial bevacizumab therapy was 9 months with a range of 2 to 34 months.

discontinued study therapy due to recurrent hematologic
toxicity after 4 cycles and is currently receiving her fifth
cycle of nonstudy irinotecan and bevacizumab with stable
disease. Eight patients (32%) remain alive, including
the 2 described above and 6 who are progressed on study
therapy and are currently receiving additional salvage
therapy. Seventeen patients (68%) have died.
Study Drug Administration and Safety
Study drug administration and compliance with treatment for the intent-to-treat study population were excellent. A total of 80 cycles of therapy were administered
including a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-12) per patient.
Twenty-one patients (84%) discontinued study therapy
due to progressive disease. Single patients discontinued
study therapy due to completion of 1 year of therapy with
no evidence of active disease, recurrent grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, noncompliance, and voluntary withdrawal,
respectively.
All patients were assessable for toxicity. Table 2
summarizes the frequency of grade 2 adverse events that
were at least possibly related to the study regimen as a percentage of the total number of cycles administered during
the study. Most adverse events were grade 2, whereas the
most common grade 3 or 4 events were hematologic.
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 6 (24%) and 2
(8%) patients, whereas grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia
occurred in 3 patients (13%), and grade 3 anemia
occurred in 2 patients (8%). Among nonhematologic

events, grade 3 events were limited to fatigue in 3 patients
(13%) and hypertension in 2 patients (8%). Nine patients
(36%) required 1 dose reduction of carboplatin and irinotecan, whereas 2 patients (8%) required 2 dose reductions.
There were no study-related deaths or episodes of intracranial hemorrhage.
Outcome
The median follow-up for all patients was 7.99 months
(95% CI, 6.25-11.02). Outcome analysis was based on
the intent-to-treat population and includes 1 patient who
discontinued study therapy on day 2 of cycle 1 due to voluntary withdrawal. Median OS, PFS, and PFS-6 rate are
summarized in Table 3 and Figure 1. Best radiographic
response was stable disease in 20 patients (80%) and progressive disease in 4 (16%), whereas 1 patient was not
evaluable. None of the patients met criteria for radiographic response. Among 10 patients who were on dexamethasone at study initiation, 5 were able to taper by an
average of 4.6 mg per day, including 2 patients who were
able to completely discontinue dexamethasone. There was
no difference in either PFS or OS among patients who
received adjuvant bevacizumab compared with those who
received bevacizumab at recurrence, nor was there a difference in OS for patients who progressed on bevacizumab
monotherapy compared with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. However, PFS was improved for
patients who progressed on bevacizumab monotherapy
compared with those who progressed on bevacizumab
plus chemotherapy (P Â¼ .0356). Specifically, 44.4% of
patients who were treated after bevacizumab monotherapy remained progression-free after 6 months compared
with 0% of patients who were treated after progression on
bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Bevacizumab is indicated for the treatment of recurrent
GBM patients in the United States, Canada, and a growing number of countries worldwide.25 In addition, bevacizumab is currently being evaluated for newly diagnosed
GBM patients in 2 multinational, blinded placebo-controlled randomized phase 3 studies as well as additional
phase 2 studies.44,45 Thus, a high percentage of GBM
patients are currently receiving bevacizumab either at recurrence or after initial diagnosis. Although bevacizumab
substantially improves rates of radiographic response and
PFS, all patients ultimately progress. Furthermore, survival after bevacizumab progression is poor.
To date, effective treatment after bevacizumab progression has not been identified (Table 3). Two prospective studies have been reported. Among 19 patients with
recurrent GBM who progressed on single-agent bevacizumab, median PFS after initiation of bevacizumab plus irinotecan was only 1.1 months. Overall survival was not
reported for these patients.24 Similarly, among 23 recurrent GBM patients treated with bevacizumab plus protracted daily (metronomic) chemotherapy using either
temozolomide or etoposide after bevacizumab failure, the
median OS was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.8-5.8) and PFS-6
was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.1-18.2).46 Several relatively small
retrospective series (range of evaluated patients, 19-35)
report median OS and PFS-6 probability of 2.2 to 4.1
months and 0% to 4.4%, respectively.26,27,48 Of note, a
retrospective review reported that patients who received
stereotactic radiosurgery with bevacizumab and chemotherapy achieved a median PFS of 2.6 months and a median OS of 7.2 months after prior bevacizumab failure; in
comparison, patients who received bevacizumab and
chemotherapy alone, without a radiosurgical boost, had a
median PFS of 1.7 months and a median OS of 3.3
months. These results suggest that stereotactic radiosurgery may improve outcome for some patients after progression on bevacizumab; however, these findings require
prospective evaluation.
Our phase 2 study demonstrates that continuation
of bevacizumab with carboplatin and irinotecan is associated with a modest improvement in outcome compared
with historical data for recurrent GBM patients who have
progressed on bevacizumab therapy. Although prospective, this small series enrolled patients with relatively
favorable prognostic factors including younger age and
good performance status, thus further evaluation of this
regimen should be considered in a randomized, controlled
trial. Another concern is that our study design precludes

5356

determination of whether therapeutic benefit required
combination of all 3 study agents or if a subset of the study
regimen may have been sufficient to render therapeutic
benefit. Specifically, we did not evaluate whether either
carboplatin alone or carboplatin and irinotecan without
bevacizumab may have improved outcome in our study.
However, it is unlikely that irinotecan alone, irinotecan
plus bevacizumab, or carboplatin plus bevacizumab were
responsible for therapeutic benefit in our study based on
the lack of benefit observed with these regimens in previously reported series.24,26,27,48
The rationale for this study regimen was based on
several considerations. Bevacizumab was included to
avoid fulminant â€˜â€˜reboundâ€™â€™ tumor regrowth that has been
reported upon abrupt bevacizumab discontinuation39 and
because anti-VEGF therapy can normalize tumor vasculature and improve chemotherapy delivery.49 Furthermore,
a retrospective registry series reported that bevacizumab
continuation after progression on a bevacizumab regimen
improves survival in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer.50 The combination of carboplatin and irinotecan
was considered attractive for several reasons. First, each of
these agents has modest antitumor activity when administered separately among recurrent malignant glioma
patients.31-36,38,51 Second, the mechanisms of cytotoxicity
of each agent are potentially complementary. Specifically,
irinotecan inhibits DNA replication by blocking topoisomerase 1, whereas carboplatin induces DNA crosslinks and adducts. Third, the primary toxicities of each
agent, gastrointestinal for irinotecan and hematologic for
carboplatin, are nonoverlapping; thus, combining the 2
agents is expected to be associated with acceptable toxicity. Fourth, pharmacologic metabolism paths of each
agent differ, suggesting that detrimental pharmacologic
interactions associated with a combined regimen are not
expected. Finally, studies using carboplatin plus irinotecan for patients with other aggressive solid tumors have
generated encouraging evidence of antitumor activity and
overall adequate tolerance.52-54
Our study demonstrates that the combination of
carboplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab is associated
with adequate safety, despite enrolling patients who were
moderately pretreated. The type, frequency, and severity
of encountered toxicity was similar to that which has
been reported for each agent when administered separately,31-36,38,51 thus the combination did not cause unexpected events. One factor that may have contributed to
the acceptable safety profile we observed was the exclusion
of patients homozygous for the *28 UGT1A1 allele

because such patients are predicted to be at increased risk
of irinotecan toxicity.55,56
Treatment of GBM patients who progress on bevacizumab therapy is currently a dire unmet need in neurooncology. We demonstrate that carboplatin, irinotecan,
and bevacizumab is associated with modest antitumor
benefit and adequate safety in moderately pretreated
GBM patients who have progressed on bevacizumab. Further evaluation of this regimen is warranted, and the identification of effective therapies for GBM patients who
progress on bevacizumab should be highly prioritized.
