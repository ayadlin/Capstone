BACKGROUND. Postchemotherapy surgery is an essential component in the management of patients with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCT). The authors assessed
their institutional experience of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)
after multiple chemotherapy regimens for advanced GCT.

METHODS. By analyzing the institutional prospective surgical database from 1989
to 2004, 71 patients were identified who underwent RPLND after multiple chemotherapy regimens. Clinicopathologic and treatment trends were characterized, and

predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS) were evaluated.

RESULTS. The histologic findings at RPLND were fibrosis in 36 men (51%), GCT in
20 men (28%), and teratoma in 15 men (21%). Patients who underwent RPLND
from 1989 to 1998 (n ¼ 47), compared with patients who underwent RPLND from
1999 to 2004 (n ¼ 24) were more likely to have GCT (36% vs 13%; P ¼ .04). Patients
who received taxane-containing chemotherapy regimens as salvage therapy had
lower rates of GCT at RPLND (14% vs 42%; P ¼ .01), higher rates of fibrosis (63% vs
39%; P ¼ .04), and similar rates of teratoma (31% vs 33%; P ¼ .9). The 5- and
10-year DSS rates were 74% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 62–86%) and 70%
(95% CI, 56–84%), respectively. Five-year DSS based on worst histology of RPLND
and extraretroperitoneal specimens was 87% (95% CI, 75–99%) for fibrosis, 87% for
teratoma (95% CI, 63–100%), and 47% for GCT (95% CI, 23–71%; P ¼ .004). On
multivariable analysis, retroperitoneal mass 5 cm and GCT were predictors of
worse DSS (P ¼ .03 and P ¼ .005, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS. Taxane-based salvage chemotherapeutic regimens appear to have
decreased the rate of GCT at RPLND. The current data support RPLND in select
patients after salvage chemotherapy, because a considerable proportion has teratoma or GCT, and the 10-year DSS rate after resection is 70%. Cancer 2007;

nduction chemotherapy is the initial treatment for men with clinical
stage IIB or III germ cell tumor (GCT) or patients with elevated serum tumor markers (STM). Approximately 20% to 30% of patients experience disease progression or recurrence and that requires salvage
chemotherapy.1 Depending on their risk profile, from 35% to 70% of
these patients will achieve a complete response to ifosfamide and cisplatin-based regimens.2–4 Patients with disease amenable to surgery

gression during second-line therapy or subsequent recurrence portends a very poor prognosis.
Relatively few contemporary data exist on RPLND
after multiple regimens of chemotherapy. When RPLND
is performed in this setting, it has been reported that
viable GCT occurs in approximately 50% of patients.5–7
Because of the high proportion of men with viable
GCT or teratoma after salvage chemotherapy, surgical
resection of all disease sites is attempted when feasible. The objectives of the current study were to review
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience with RPLND after multiple chemotherapy regimens and specifically evaluate the clinicopathologic
and treatment trends in addition to potential predictors of disease-specific outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval,
we identified 79 patients in our prospective testicular
cancer surgical database who underwent their initial
RPLND between 1989 and 2004 after 2 regimens of

chemotherapy. We excluded 8 patients who underwent RPLND for late recurrences, which we defined as
disease recurrence after >2 disease-free years,8 leaving
71 patients in the final study cohort. No patient underwent repeat RPLND.
At initial diagnosis, patients were classified as good,
intermediate, or poor risk according to the International
Germ Cell Consensus Classification Group (IGCCCG).9
The most common first chemotherapy regimens consisted of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (EP/BEP)
(n ¼ 50) or vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and bleomycin (VAB-6) with or without autologous bone marrow transplantation (AuBMT)
(n ¼ 11), and salvage regimens included paclitaxel, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (TICE) (n ¼ 25);
paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP) (n ¼ 10); etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) (n ¼ 11); etoposide and cisplatin (EC); etoposide and carboplatin
(n ¼ 10); or other regimens (n ¼ 15) (Table 1). After
each chemotherapy regimen, STM levels were obtained,
and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed to assess tumor

response. STM elevation was defined as an a-fetoprotein (AFP) level >15.0 ng/mL or a b-human chorionic
gonadotropin (b-HCG) level >2.2 U/mL that did not
decline according to its serum half-life. Lymph node
size before and after chemotherapy was determined by
measuring the greatest transverse dimension of the
largest mass on CT imaging. In patients with normalized STM levels, an RPLND and surgical resection of
all extraretroperitoneal residual masses were recommended when feasible. For select patients with elevated
STM levels, a desperation RPLND was recommended,
particularly if it was believed that all radiographic disease was resectable and the serum AFP level was elevated. Over the study period, the postchemotherapy
RPLND template varied slightly by surgeon, but a full,
infrahilar, bilateral template was the most common. Preoperatively, it was believed that all 71 patients had disease that was amenable to complete surgical resection.
After RPLND, 5 patients who were treated between
1989 and 1992 received additional chemotherapy.
Since 1993, when it was demonstrated that diseasespecific survival (DSS) did not improve with additional
chemotherapy in this setting,5 all men with viable GCT
at RPLND were placed on postoperative surveillance.
To evaluate trends, the study was divided into 3
distinct time periods (1989–1992, 1993–1998, and 1999–
2004). The chi-square test for independence, with Yates
correction when necessary, was used to compare timespecific trends and histologic findings at RPLND. Univariate predictors of viable GCT or DSS from the time
of RPLND were analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier
method and log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards
regression model that included all variables with a P
value <.05 on univariate analysis was built to predict
DSS. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
(version 14.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics
Patient characteristics prior to RPLND are summarized
in Table 2. The majority of patients (71%) presented
initially with stage III disease. The initial histologic diagnosis was obtained after inguinal orchiectomy in
49 men (69%), after extragonadal biopsy (supraclavicular lymph node, retroperitoneum, or liver) in 19 men
(27%), and laparotomy in 3 men (4%). Prior to secondline chemotherapy, 52 patients (73%) failed to achieve
a complete remission to first-line treatment, and 19
patients (27%) had achieved a complete response followed by disease recurrence at a median of 221 days
(interquartile range, 118–370 days). Prior to RPLND, 64
patients (90%) received 2 regimens of chemotherapy,
and 7 patients (10%) received either 3 or 4 regimens.

6 men (8%). STM levels were elevated prior to RPLND
in 20 men (28%), including AFP elevations in 13 men
(18%) and HCG elevations in 7 men (10%). No patient
had both markers elevated.

Patient and Treatment Characteristics by Year
Trends in clinical characteristics and chemotherapy
regimens are summarized in Table 1. During each period (1989–1992, 1993–1998, and 1999–2004), the proportion of patients with good risk (35%, 42%, 46%,
respectively) and with intermediate or poor risk (65%,
58%, 54%, respectively) remained stable. Overall, induction chemotherapy was EP/BEP in 50 men (70%),
VAB-6 with or without AuBMT in 11 men (16%), VIP
with or without AuBMT in 5 men (7%), and other regimens in 5 men (7%). EP and BEP were used more commonly in the 2 later periods of study (88% vs 35%;
P<.001). The second-line regimen was TICE in 25 men
(35%) and TIP in 10 men (14%). TIP and TICE were
used more frequently after 1992 (73% vs 0%; P < .001).
Of the 7 patients who required a third chemotherapy
regimen, 4 patients received VIP, 1 patient received
paclitaxel, 1 patient received EC, and 1 patient received
an epothilone. In the 2 patients who received a fourth
chemotherapy regimen, VIP and TIP were used in 1
patient each. The proportion of patients achieving a
complete response to induction chemotherapy did not
differ by time period (P ¼ .3). The mean size of retroperitoneal mass prechemotherapy and pre-RPLND did
not change significantly by year (P ¼ .8 and P ¼ .4,
respectively).

RPLND Histology
At RPLND, the histologic findings were viable GCT in
20 men (28%), teratoma in 15 men (21%), and fibrosis
in 36 men (51%) (Table 3). Elements of teratoma were
present in 23 men (32%), and 2 men (3%) had teratoma
with malignant transformation. Men who underwent
RPLND during the 2 earlier periods (1989–1998) were
more likely to have viable GCT than men who underwent RPLND during the most recent years (1999–2004;
36% vs 13%; P ¼ .04). Comparing these periods, the
proportion of men with teratoma only at RPLND (19%
vs 25%; P ¼ .6) or with any element of teratoma (32%
vs 33%; P ¼ .9) was not different.
RPLND histology was not associated with the size
of the retroperitoneal mass (Table 3). For patients who
had retroperitoneal masses that measured <2 cm,
from 2 cm to 4.9 cm, or 5 cm, the rate of viable GCT
ranged from 24% to 31%, the rate of teratoma ranged
from 14% to 25%, and the rate of fibrosis ranged from
44% to 62%. For the 21 patients who had retroperitoneal masses that measured <2 cm, 8 men (38%) had
either viable GCT or teratoma. For the 5 patients without measurable retroperitoneal disease on CT scan, 1
patient had pN2 embryonal carcinoma, and the other
4 patients had fibrosis.
Patients who received taxane-containing chemotherapy regimens as salvage therapy had lower rates of
viable GCT at RPLND (14% vs 42%; P ¼ .01), higher rates
of fibrosis (63% vs 39%; P ¼ .04), and similar rates of teratoma (31% vs 33%; P ¼ .9) (Table 3).

GCT at RPLND included not receiving TIP or TICE as

Clinical Outcome
The median follow-up after RPLND was 30 months for
the entire cohort and 52 months for the patients who
remained alive at last follow-up. Overall, 21 patients
(30%) had disease recurrences after RPLND, including
2 patients who had retroperitoneal recurrences. The 5and 10-year DSS rates for the entire cohort were 74%
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 62–86%) and 70%
(56–84%), respectively. The 5-year DSS rate based on
histology at RPLND was 85% (95% CI, 73–97%) for men
with fibrosis, 77% (95% CI, 49–100%) for men with teratoma, and 56% (95% CI, 33–79%) for men with GCT
(P ¼ .055). The 5-year DSS rate based on worst histology of RPLND and extraretroperitoneal resection was
87% (95% CI, 75–99%) for men with fibrosis, 87% (95%
CI, 63–100%) for men with teratoma, and 47% (95% CI,
23–71%) for men with GCT (P ¼ .004) (Fig. 1).
On univariate analysis, 5-year DSS was worse in
patients who had retroperitoneal masses that measured 5 cm (55% vs 80%; P ¼ .04), elevated HCG levels
(35% vs 79%; P ¼ .007), and viable GCT (47% vs 87%
for teratoma vs 87% for fibrosis; P ¼ .004) (Table 6).
There was a trend toward improved 5-year DSS for
patients who received taxane-based, second-line chemotherapy regimens (86% vs 65%; P ¼ .09). On multivariable analysis, a retroperitoneal mass 5 cm (hazard
ratio, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.1–8.1; P ¼ .03) and viable GCT
(hazard ratio, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.6–12.4; P ¼ .005) predicted
a worse DSS (Table 7).
For a sensitivity analysis, we excluded patients
who had elevated STM levels at the time of RPLND.
Viable GCT either in the retroperitoneum or in extraretroperitoneal sites predicted for worse DSS (P ¼ .001).
Although it was not statistically significant, there was a
trend toward improved DSS for patients who received
TIP or TICE as salvage chemotherapy (P ¼ .2), patients

who had retroperitoneal masses <5 cm (P ¼ .14), and
patients who had teratoma or fibrosis in the retroperitoneum (P ¼ .07).

DISCUSSION
Resection of residual masses after multiple chemotherapy regimens is an integral component of the successful,
multidisciplinary treatment of patients with advanced
testicular cancer.10 The histologic findings after multiple chemotherapy regimens differ substantially from
those generally reported for RPLND after induction
chemotherapy, in which approximately 40% to 45% of
patients have fibrosis, 40% to 45% of patients have teratoma, and 10% to 20% have viable GCT.11,12 For
RPLND after multiple chemotherapy regimens, the largest series of patients, which was reported in 1993 by
Fox et al,5 had 55% with viable GCT, consistent with 2
subsequent studies by Hendry et al6 and Rick et al,7
which showed rates of 42% and 49%, respectively.
In the current study, there were 4 important findings for patients undergoing RPLND after multiple
chemotherapy regimens. First, nearly 50% have either
viable GCT or teratoma. Second, probably as a result of
improved salvage taxane-based chemotherapy regimens, the proportion with viable GCT has decreased
from 36% to 13%. Third, extraretroperitoneal disease frequently harbors viable GCT or teratoma (31%). Fourth,
10-year DSS is favorable at 70%.

higher rate of fibrosis (51%) and a lower rate of viable
GCT (28%). Although it was lower, the frequency of
viable GCT in our study confirms the important therapeutic role of salvage surgery while precluding the
need for additional chemotherapy.
In addition, nearly 33% of all patients in our study
had elements of teratoma at RPLND, regardless of the
year of surgery. Considerable evidence highlights the
importance of complete resection of teratoma. Residual teratoma has the potential for local growth, leading
to local invasion and the growing teratoma syndrome.13

Malignant transformation to sarcoma and various
other histologies has been reported.14 Finally, patients
with teratoma are at risk for late recurrence, which
carries an increased probability of being refractory to
treatment.8
The proportion of patients with viable GCT decreased substantially during the final 5 years of our
study compared with earlier years. This may have
occurred for several reasons. Significantly lower rates
of GCT were observed in patients who received taxane-containing regimens as second-line chemotherapy (14% vs 42%), consistent with recent reports of
complete responses in 70% of patients who received
TIP2 and in 57% of patients who received TICE.4 The
TIP regimen is administered to patients who have developed recurrent disease after achieving a complete
response to induction chemotherapy,2 whereas TICE
is administered after an incomplete response to induction chemotherapy.4 Although patient selection
appeared to be consistent over the study period, with
IGCCCG risk categories at initial chemotherapy and
size of retroperitoneal masses before and after chemotherapy unchanged by year, other factors, such as
improvements in the induction chemotherapy regimens, may have contributed to the lower rate of GCT
in more recent years.
Elements of viable GCT or teratoma were identified
in 31% of patients who underwent extraretroperitoneal
resection. This observation highlights the importance of
resection of all sites of disease after chemotherapy,
including extraretroperitoneal masses, to optimize outcome. Although there is an inherent appeal to determine
the need for extraretroperitoneal resections based on
retroperitoneal histology, we observed an overall 25%
discordance rate between retroperitoneal and extraretroperitoneal histology. Although patients with fibrosis
in the retroperitoneum had a high likelihood of fibrosis
at extraretroperitoneal sites, the number of patients is
small, the 95% confidence limit is from 85% to 100%, and
retroperitoneal histology is not known when extraretroperitoneal resections are performed during the same

surgery. Hence, without complete certainty regarding
fibrosis at extraretroperitoneal sites, we continue to
advocate resection of all extraretroperitoneal sites.
In light of the high-risk features and heavily pretreated nature of our patients, the 5-year DSS rate after
RPLND is excellent at 74%. This compares favorably to
the 5-year overall survival rate of 56% reported by the
Royal Marsden Hospital.6 Not surprisingly, both the
Royal Marsden Hospital report and our study identified worse outcomes for patients with viable GCT at
RPLND and for patients with larger masses; however,
survival is still quite good, emphasizing the need to
resect all residual sites of disease, regardless of size. In
our study, patients with larger masses (5 cm) did not
have a higher rate of viable GCT in the retroperitoneum but did have lower overall survival rates. This
occurred because 2 of 4 patients (50%) with retroperitoneal teratoma  5 cm died of their disease.
We also found a trend toward worse survival when
the b-HCG level was increased prior to surgery, whereas
the AFP level was not associated with outcome. These
findings are consistent with previous reports that an
elevated AFP level at the time of salvage surgery is associated with a more favorable outcome compared with
patients who have an elevated HCG.15,16
In conclusion, in a series of 71 patients who
underwent RPLND after multiple chemotherapy regimens, fibrosis was present in 51% of patients, viable
GCT was present in 28% of patients, and teratoma
was present in 21% of patients. During the latter years
of our study, there was a significantly lower incidence
of GCT that probably was because of improved taxane-containing chemotherapeutic regimens, such as
TIP and TICE. The 10-year DSS rate was 70%. For
these reasons, our data support the continued use of
salvage surgery in 3 separate groups of patients. First,
patients who achieve a complete response to secondline chemotherapy and have no radiologic evidence of
disease should undergo RPLND, because 38% of the
patients in our study who had retroperitoneal masses
<2 cm had GCT or teratoma. Second, patients who
achieve a complete or partial response to chemotherapy with resectable residual masses should undergo
RPLND with extraretroperitoneal resection, as indicated. Finally, highly selected patients with residual
masses and elevated STM levels, particularly AFP, after chemotherapy may be candidates for surgery.
