Abstract
Helicobacter pylori infection is marked by a strong association with various
gastric diseases, including gastritis, ulcers, and gastric cancer. Antibiotic treatment
regimens have low success rates due to the rapid occurrence of resistant H. pylori
strains, necessitating the development of novel anti-H. pylori strategies. Here, we
investigated the therapeutic potential of a novel peptide, Tilapia Piscidin 4 (TP4),
against multidrug resistant gastric pathogen H. pylori, based on its in vitro and in vivo
efficacy. TP4 inhibited the growth of both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant H. pylori
(CagA+, VacA+) via membrane micelle formation, which led to membrane depolarization
and extravasation of cellular constituents. During colonization of gastric tissue, H.
pylori infection maintains high T regulatory subsets and a low Th17/Treg ratio, and
results in expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment with
TP4 suppressed Treg subset populations and pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines.
TP4 restored the Th17/Treg balance, which resulted in early clearance of H. pylori
density and recovery of gastric morphology. Toxicity studies demonstrated that TP4
treatment has no adverse effects in mice or rabbits. The results of this study indicate
that TP4 may be an effective and safe monotherapeutic agent for the treatment of
multidrug resistant H. pylori infections.

INTRODUCTION

studies claim that H. pylori infection may also lead to
non-gastric diseases, such as idiopathic Parkinsonism
and non-arteric optic ischemic neuropathy [8-10]. Metaanalysis has revealed that the efficacy of antibiotic
regimens, including clarithromycin, have declined over
time, due to the increase in resistance [11, 12]. H. pylori
infection is increasingly challenging to cure because of
the dominance of resistance to antibiotics, in particular
metronidazole (MTZ), which is a key component of the
triple-therapy regimen [13]. The protracted nature of H.

Helicobacter pylori are microaerophilic, Gramnegative bacillus bacteria that colonize the gastric mucosa.
It is recognized as the major aetiological factor in gastritis,
gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer [1-5].
Prolonged H. pylori infection and inflammation due to
bacterial virulence and host genetic factors are important
risk factors for several gastro- duodenal diseases, including
gastric malignancy and peptic ulcer diseases [6, 7]. Recent

pylori colonization and failure of treatment necessitated
that treatment strategies change from mono- to triple-, and
ultimately quadruple- and rescue-therapies [14]. Longterm treatments, combined with high doses of antibiotics
and patient noncompliance, have led to the development
of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori, and the spread of
resistant strains. As a consequence, there is an alarming
need for new anti-H. pylori treatments with both superior
therapeutic efficacy and negligible adverse effects.
Cationic gene-encoded host defense peptides (HDP)
are nature’s most diverse and lavish class of antibiotics.
Most higher organisms harness these peptides as part
of their innate immune systems. A subclass of HDP,
known as antimicrobial peptides (AMP), exert direct
antimicrobial activity by damaging bacterial membrane
integrity and/or by translocation through membranes.
AMPs can also inhibit intrabacterial processes, such as
cell wall synthesis, DNA/RNA/protein synthesis, and
even cell division [15]. Thus, AMPs with low molecular
weights, composed of about 12 to 60 amino acids, are
potential novel antimicrobial agents against human
and animal pathogens. Recently, a much larger AMP,
lactoferricin, has been identified, indicative of greater
AMP diversity [16-18]. AMPs also exhibit a wide range
of diversity in sequence, structure, charge, and abundance
of specific amino acids [19]. AMPs may exert potent and
rapid activity against a broad range of bacteria, viruses,
fungi, and protozoa. This is achieved through cell lysis
via direct binding, intracellular processes, neutralization
of endotoxins, and wound healing [15, 20, 21]. More
significantly, these molecules are of particular interest for
potential therapeutic use because of their ability to kill
multidrug resistant microorganisms [22]. Many AMPs
are undergoing preclinical and clinical trials. Pexiganan
(MSI-78), a broad-spectrum AMP, was the first to undergo
commercial development [23]. Omiganan (MBI-226),
another commercial AMP, is a synthetic analogue of
indolicidin, which has broad antibacterial and antifungal
activity [24].
A class of cationic AMPs called Piscidins was
recently found to be expressed by fish mast cells [25].
Piscidin AMPs are made up of 21~ 44 residues, and
possess an amphipathic-helical structure [26, 27].
Synthetic piscidin 2 has fungicidal activity against
Candida albicans, Malassezia furfur, and Trichosporon
beigelii in vitro [28]. In a previous study, we isolated
five novel piscidins from Tilapia, and examined their
antimicrobial and anti-fungal activity, revealing these
compounds to be potent and promising antimicrobial
agents with broad spectra of activity.
A more complete understanding of how these short
amphipathic cationic AMPs bring about bacterial cell
death and host immunomodulation is needed for further
optimization and development for clinical applications.
We previously demonstrated the latent effect of Tilapia
piscidins on clinically-important pathogens [29]. Here,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we report that four representative Tilapia piscidin
peptides exhibit antibacterial activities against H. pylori
in vitro. Tilapia Piscidin 4 (referred to hereafter as
TP4) demonstrated the most potent activity, and was
active against a broad spectrum of strains, while being
remarkably stable at low pH. We further report that TP4
has multiple modes of action, including direct membrane
disruption and interference of intracellular processes,
as well as counterbalancing the host immune system.
We previously reported that TP4 exhibits low toxicity
against human and mouse cell lines, and low hemolytic
activity [29]. In this study, we show that: (i) TP4 exerts
its antimicrobial effects against bacteria via disruption
of membrane potential; (ii) the vulnerability of clinical
isolates to TP4 is not associated with preexisting resistance
to antibiotics; (iii) TP4 reduces H. pylori infection by
specifically inducing host adaptive immune responses
against persistent colonization in gastric tissue; and
(iv) TP4 acts in a synergistic manner with conventional
antibiotics. Collectively, our results suggest TP4 as a
promising agent for use against multidrug resistant H.
pylori.

RESULTS
Determination of MIC and MBC for Tilapia
Piscidins 1~5 against H. pylori
Our previous study demonstrated that the Tilapia
Piscidins are potent against Gram negative and Gram
positive pathogens [29]. In this current study we
investigated the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
of five Tilapia Piscidins against various H. pylori strains,
including antibiotic resistant clinical isolate CI-HP028.
The MIC values are presented in Table 1. With the
exception of TP2, all peptides (TP1, TP3, TP4, and TP5)
inhibited the growth of H. pylori. The peptide with the
strongest efficacy was TP4, and so it was selected for indepth characterization (TP2 was used as a control peptide
due to its lack of anti-H. pylori activity). The data in Table
1 indicate that all four strains of H. pylori are sensitive to
TP4 (MIC- 1.5-3 µg mL-1), irrespective of whether the
strain is sensitive or resistant to antibiotics.

Dose and time killing curves
The rate of antimicrobial activity is important,
as it determines whether the required concentration
is maintained for sufficient time in a harsh gastric
environment. Therefore, we examined dose and time kill
curves against H. pylori. The bactericidal rate was found
to be 99% and 99.9% at MIC and 2 x MIC, respectively.
As shown in Figure 1A, no colonies were recovered
after treatment with 1 x MIC of TP4. The time required

antibiotic resistance

to establish a 99 % killing rate was about 180 minutes.
Incubation with 2 or 4 x MIC increased the killing rate.
Taken together, these data indicate that the efficacy of
TP4 is reliant on both dose and duration. These data also
suggest that TP4 binds to a fixed number of bacterial
targets.

We next compared the time-based bactericidal
activities of TP4 and conventional antibiotics against

for 1 h, and then incubated with the indicated concentrations (1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 fold of MIC) of TP4. Control peptide and H. pylori alone

multidrug resistant clinical isolate CI-HC-028 (certain
strains are metronidazole and clarithromycin resistant)
[30]. We observed that by ~6 hr, TP4 treatment had
reduced H. pylori by >3 log, while, of the antibiotics, only
amoxicillin caused 90% killing within 24 hr (see Figure
1B). Metronidazole caused an initial decrease in cell count,
but gradually lost activity; clarithromycin consistently
reduced c.f.u., but the time taken to 90% reduction was
>24 hr. Thus, there is no correlation between multidrug
resistant (MDR) phenotype and vulnerability to TP4.
Therefore, TP4 is superior to conventional antibiotics
against MDR bacterial strains.

last passage. However, the resistance index for TP4 did
not change during the course of our experiment. These
findings suggest that bacteria may not readily develop
resistance to this AMP.

TP4 exhibits synergistic activity with antibiotics
against resistant H. pylori
Combination therapy often enhances antibiotic
efficacy and mitigates the frequency at which drug
resistance emerges [32]. To determine the suitability of
TP4 for combination therapy, we examined in vitro doseOD fall kinetics of TP4 in combination with AMOX,
CLRN, or METZ antibiotics; these three antibiotics are
traditionally used as the first line of defense against H.
pylori [33]. We report that TP4 has a significant synergistic
effect, reducing the MIC of amoxicillin by one-fourth and
the MIC of metronidazole and clarithromycin by one-half
(see Figure 2B).

Development of drug resistance
Inappropriate antibiotic use and poor compliance
with therapeutic regimens is a major driver of drug
resistance [31]. Here, we established a model for
simulating conditions of drug resistance emergence:
bacteria were exposed to sub-inhibitory doses of
amoxicillin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, or peptide
TP4 in vitro. C3H/HeN mice were infected with the
resulting inocula, and colonized mouse gastric tissue
was subsequently harvested for evaluation of drug
susceptibility (drug resistance index MICp/MICs). This
process was repeated for over 10 passages (see Figure
2A). The resistance index for amoxicillin increased
slightly after passage 6, and remained constant thereafter.
For clarithromycin and metronidazole, the resistance
indices (MIC) gradually increased from passage 3 to the

constituents in a manner that may interrupt biomolecule
synthesis [34]. Thus, we examined whether TP4
induces permeation and disruption of the H. pylori cell
membrane. We assessed membrane integrity using
1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) [35]. Generally, NPN
is blocked by intact bacterial cell membranes. However,
when outer membrane assembly is disrupted, NPN easily
passes through the barrier into the hydrophobic interior
of the outer membrane, resulting in a rapid increase
in fluorescence. We thus examined NPN fluorescence
intensity following TP4 treatment (see Figure 3A). TP4
increased fluorescence at sub-MIC values, indicating that
TP4 effectively permeabilizes membranes. However,
AMOX treatment also caused a slight increase in
fluorescence intensity at higher doses. To confirm that
TP4 increases the porousness of the cell membrane, we
analyzed the surface charge (zeta potential (ζ)/mV) of
bacterial cultures (see Figure 3B) [36]. H. pylori inocula
from blood agar and liquid cultures displayed zeta
potentials of -33.83 and -27.47 mV, respectively. Addition
of TP4 at the MIC to blood agar or liquid inocula of H.
pylori increased the zeta potential to +13.03 and -6.18
mV, respectively. These data strongly suggest that TP4 has
affinity with the H. pylori surface membrane, and thereby
lyses the membrane.

Next, we used TEM to inspect the ultrastructure
of cells following treatment with TP4 (see Figure 4)
and amoxicillin. Low and high-magnification images of
control H. pylori cells reveal long, regular spiral structures,
and few circular coccoid cells with intact cell membranes
(see Figure 4A, 4D). Upon early exposure to amoxicillin,
however, H. pylori appeared as “ghost” cells, with loose
outer membranes. Interestingly, amoxicillin treatment
did not alter the coccoid forms [37, 38] (see Figure 4B,
E), while TP4 treatment resulted in substantial disruption
of bacterial cell membranes through micellization
(see Figures 4C, 4F). TP4 treatment also resulted in an
abundance of readily observable electron-dense structures.
The effects of TP4 detectable shortly after exposure (120
minutes) are consistent with the observed NPN membrane
permeabilization time (see Figure 3A) and the time kill
assay data (see Figure 1A).
At higher magnifications (X7000-15000), we
observed extensive membrane perturbation of H. pylori
following exposure to TP4 (Figure 5A-5C)); specifically,
we observed protruding micelles and membrane sloughing
(see Figure 5A). In addition, we observed missing
membrane sections (see Figure 5B) and nicks indicative
of micellization, as well as detachment of bacterial-TP4

cells incubated with NPN and control peptide, were used as negative controls. NPN fluorescence intensity was recorded as a correlate of
membrane permeation. (B) Zeta-potential (ζ) of H. pylori in the presence/absence of TP4. Striped bars: H. pylori grown in blood agar plates;

pylori virulence protein urease B, which is pivotal for
colonization in the acidic environment of the stomach.
Urease B protein was detected at high levels in the infected
group, while triple therapy decreased protein expression,
and TP4 treatment abolished detectable protein (see
Figure 7D-7E). These data, together with the membrane
and surface charge disruption findings (see Figure 3A and
B), suggest that the H. pylori virulence factors Cag A and
Urease are released in outer membrane vesicles, which
are engendered from the bacterial membrane and possess
the same composition and surface charge as the parent
membrane. In summary, TP4 clears extracellular bacteria
and their outer membrane vesicles.

micelles (see Figure 5C). Outer membrane destruction
was evidenced by the formation of micelles, which in
turn resulted in membrane depolarization and leakage. As
expected, the morphology is consistent with the observed
zeta potential (see Figure 3B). Taken together, these
data indicate that internalized TP4 disrupts intracellular
components, thereby causing H. pylori cell death through
induction of membrane micellization [39-41]. A proposed
mechanism of action representing TP4 action and its
significant events are depicted in Figure 12.

Efficacy of TP4 in vivo against H. pylori in a mouse
model of infection

Histological examination and special staining
analysis

The in vitro data described above suggest that
TP4 has strong activity against H. pylori. We proceeded
to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy and
immunomodulatory properties of TP4 against H. pylori.
The experimental plan to establish in vivo infection is
represented schematically in Figure 6A. At 1 wk post
infection, mice were divided into 3 groups (n = 6) and
treated with PBS, TP4, or PPI-Triple therapy.
After treatment, rapid urease tests were performed to
confirm that H. pylori was present in the gastric tissue of
untreated mice or mice treated with triple therapy, but not
of mice treated with TP4 (see Figure 6B (a)). Furthermore,
; 7 × 105 c.f.u./g of H. pylori was detected in the stomach
tissue of mice in the untreated group; this was significantly
reduced to 5 × 104 c.f.u./g in mice treated with triple
therapy (p=0. 0187) (Figure 6B(b)). Several methods
were unable to detect bacteria in the gastric tissue of mice
treated with TP4, but the probability of bacterial presence
was set as 1 for statistical comparison. As compared with
the triple therapy group, TP4 caused a significant reduction
of bacterial burden (p = 0.00152). This confirms that TP4
treatment significantly cleared the H. pylori burden from
the stomachs of infected mice.

Histological examination of gastric tissue sections
stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed severe
inflammation in infected mice (see Figure 8A, 8B).
Furthermore, the ulcer crater and muscularis mucosae
layer were heavily infiltrated by inflammatory cells. By
intruding upon the chief and parietal cell regions, these
inflammatory cells resulted in superficial damage to the
surface epithelium, which is a known response to severe H.
pylori biased-host immune responses upon colonization.
Triple therapy did not reduce inflammation. However,
treatment with TP4 significantly reduced H. pylori-induced
inflammation, and cleared immune cell infiltration at ulcer
crater and muscularis mucosae, thereby restoring gastric
tissue morphology. Special modified Giemsa staining was
performed to detect H. pylori colonization of the gastric
mucosa (purple colored spirals; see Figure 8C). Untreated
and triple therapy-treated mice exhibited significant H.
pylori burdens in the gastric mucosae; treatment with TP4
monotherapy significantly cleared the H. pylori burden in
gastric tissue. Thus, TP4 treatment considerably reduces
the gastric bacterial burden and restores normal gastric
morphology.

Effects of TP4 on gene and protein expression of
H. pylori virulence factors

Mechanism of host immunomodulation

There is evidence for differing degrees of virulence
between H. pylori strains, arising from the presence or
absence of virulence factors [42, 43]. PCR tools used
to amplify certain putative virulence markers (the cagA
and ureB genes) provide a sensitive means of detecting
H. pylori colonization in the stomach (see Figure 7AC). Infected mice were found to be positive for both
ureB and cagA, confirming colonization at the molecular
level. Treatment with triple therapy failed to eradicate
H. pylori, but decreased band intensity. However, the
TP4-treated group tested negative for both the ureB and
cagA genes. We suggest that PCR for ureB and cagA
may be suitable for use as a diagnostic tool after therapy
[44]. We proceeded to examine gastric lysates for H.

Effects of TP4 on splenic CD4+Foxp3, Th17
T-Cells, and TH17/Treg ratio dynamics in a mouse
model of H. pylori infection
It was previously reported that H. pylori infection
induces regulatory T cells (Tregs), which leads to H.
pylori persistence [45]. Foxp3+ Tregs and interleukin
(IL)-17+ helper T (Th17) cells have been implicated in
host immunity to H. pylori, particularly at gastric mucosal
surfaces. H. pylori persistence may depend on the Th17/
Treg balance, as arbitrated by H. pylori-communicating

Oncotarget

antigen presenting cells [46]. H. pylori evades immune
clearance by tuning the host immune response to sustain
low Th17/Treg. Flow cytometry was used to demonstrate
that TP4 strongly inhibits Treg cells and moderately
suppresses Th17 cells, which increases the Th17/Treg ratio
in splenic T subsets (see Figure 9). This suppression of H.
pylori-biased host immune responses upon treatment with
TP4 dynamically clears H. pylori colonization and reduced
gastric inflammation.

Figure 10). Of these cytokines, IL-10, IL-18, and Il-17
are known to influence tenacious H. pylori colonization
and gastric inflammation. TP4 treatment resulted in
suppression of all of these genes, with the exceptions of
Il-23 and TGF-β. A decrease in IL-10 in vivo results in a
significant reduction of Treg cells, and restores the hostTh17/Treg balance. Further, moderate inhibition of IL-17
facilitates the repair of inflamed gastric tissue (evident in
the histopathology data shown in Figure 8).

Expression of gastric cytokines and T cell markers

In vivo evaluation of TP4 toxicity

We subsequently used real time-PCR to analyze the
expression of genes involved in host immune responses in
the gastric tissues of infected mice treated with or without
TP4. We discovered that gene expression of certain
cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL18, IL-10,
IL-17, Il-23, and TGF-β) and the T-cell marker FOXp3
were profoundly increased during H. pylori infection (see

11B). Furthermore, the body weight of treated animals was
normal until the last day of observation. TP4 treatment did
not induce lesions or irritation during the test period, and
no gross behavioral changes were observed. Hair growth
was also found to be normal, and necropsies did not reveal
any gross abnormalities in organ structure or architecture
[50].

efficiently across the cell membrane [53]. One potential
alternative to antibiotics is AMPs, the efficacy of which
is strongly hinted at by their pervasive presence among
eukaryotes [55]. Thus, here we evaluated the antimicrobial
activity of TP4 against antibiotic susceptible and resistant
H. pylori strains. TP4 is of the Tilapia Piscidin class of
AMPs, with potential activity against many pathogenic
and clinically challenging species, but reportedly not
against Helicobacter species [29]. Much like the AMP
Epinecidin-1, TP4 rapidly kills both Gram negative and
positive bacteria [56]. Here, we provide both in vitro and
in vivo experimental confirmation that TP4 possesses
potent antimicrobial activity against H. pylori, and report
that TP4 permeates the bacterial membrane and balances
the host immune response in a mouse model of H. pylori
infection.
Initially, we evaluated the efficacy of TP4 against
standard laboratory strains. However, the key challenge
facing antibiotic development is the treatment of
infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains. MICbased susceptibility testing was used to show that TP4
is equally efficacious against both antibiotic-sensitive
and-resistant gastric pathogen H. pylori strains. Analysis
of time-dependent kill kinetics revealed marked growth
inhibition as early as 120 minutes post exposure for
different H. pylori strains. The activity of TP4 was found
to be independent of preexisting antibiotic resistance.
These data indicate that TP4 alone or in combination with
a commonly-used antibiotic may reduce therapy duration,

DISCUSSION
The worldwide distribution of “pandrug” and
“multidrug” resistant pathogens has severely compromised
the efficacy of our antibiotics, and dramatically increased
the occurrence of therapeutic failure [51]. Triple and
quadruple therapies have had some success in eradicating
resistant infections, but these also result in adverse
effects, such as diarrhea and soft stool [52]. Excessive
use of antibiotics is also a major cause of imbalances in
the normal flora of the gut region. Moreover, H. pylori
is currently developing resistance to many clinically
important antibiotics, most likely because of the spread of
efflux pumps [54] and changes in bacterial cell membrane
composition which prevent these agents from diffusing

CONCLUSIONS

and be suitable for use against a wide range of antibioticresistant strains.
To elucidate the in vitro mode of TP4 action, we
performed NPN membrane leakage assays, measured
zeta-potential, and examined bacteria under transmission
electron microscopy. We report that TP4 has strong
affinity with the negatively-charged molecular structures
of the membrane and induces membrane micellization,
as evidenced by electron micrographs revealing lost
membrane sections (proposed mechanism of action; Figure
12 (1)). Further analysis demonstrated that the loss of
membrane integrity is accompanied by marked membrane
depolarization, based on both NPN fluorescence and
measurement of zeta potential (see Figure 12 (2 and 3)).
Recent clinical trials using AMPs which interfere
with membrane integrity and function raise the possibility
that TP4 (or other AMPs) may also be valuable for treating
infections, including those caused by MDR bacteria [57].
Even in situations where a given AMP does not exhibit
any improvement in therapeutic ratio as compared with
antibiotics, combination therapy may hold promise for
clinical applications, as suggested by the synergistic
effect of TP4 with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and
metronidazole against antibiotic-resistant strains.
We also demonstrated that monotherapeutic
treatment of animals with TP4 significantly reduced H.
pylori colonization (see Figure 6(b)). This suggests that
TP4 is stable and active in the harsh acidic and proteolytic
environment of the stomach, despite reports that such
conditions are commonly associated with reduced
bioavailability of some antibiotics. Our preliminary
studies on pH stability show that TP4 is active under
physiological acidic conditions, due to maintenance of its
high positive net charge by histidine, lysine, and arginine
[58-60]. Furthermore, TP4 must be able to penetrate the
mucous layer to reach the colonized mucosal surface;
however, the mechanism by which this is accomplished is
not clear at present.
In addition, we have shown here that TP4 selectively
suppresses H. pylori-induced host immune responses (see
Figure 9, 10). H. pylori infection induces Treg cells in
the gastric tissue to suppress effector T cell development
[61, 62]. Such significant Treg polarization aids in the
persistence of H. pylori colonization. It was recently
reported that vaccine efficiency can be improved using
a peptide inhibitor of FOXP3, which impairs Regulatory
T cell development. Similarly, peptide TP4 selectively
suppresses the cytokines and T cell markers responsible
for Treg cell development, thereby balancing the host
immune response for clearance of persistently colonized
H. pylori in gastric tissue. Finally, we performed toxicity
and safety evaluations to establish that TP4 does not cause
dermal irritation or hypersensitivity in mice or rabbits.

1.	We have demonstrated that TP4 exerts potent
antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo against H. pylori
strains (an MDR clinical isolate and the ATCC 43504
strain).
2.	 Treatment with TP4 significantly reduced H.
pylori in a mouse model of infection, as compared to
untreated controls and mice treated with conventional
antibiotics.
3.	 High doses of TP4 did not cause any toxic
effects in mice or rabbits.
4.	 TP4 selectively suppressed the H. pylori-induced
immune response by altering the expression of immuneresponsive genes. Collectively, these results support the
potential development of TP4 as a novel class of anti-H.
pylori therapeutics. These experimental findings lend
further support for future clinical development of TP4 as
a candidate drug, and possible future suitability for use
against human gastric diseases in pre-clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
H. pylori strains and growth conditions
H. pylori strains, American type cell cultures
(ATCC) 43504, 51653, and 700392, and a clinical
isolate CI-HC-028 (provided by Dr. Ming-Shiung Wu,
Department of Internal Medicine, Gastrointestinal
Hepatobilary Division, National Taiwan University
Hospital, Taiwan) were used to determine the antimicrobial
efficacy of TP4. Strains were cryopreserved at -80°C in
brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 20% FBS.
Bacteria were cultured under microaerobic conditions, as
previously described [63]. Briefly, bacteria were spread on
brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plates supplemented with
10% (v/v) sheep blood, and plates were incubated at 37°C
for 24 hr under a microaerobic atmosphere (AnaeropackAnaero, Mitsubishi, Japan).

Synthesis of the antimicrobial peptide TP4
Tilapia piscidin 4 was obtained from Nile tilapia
(Oreochromis niloticus). The peptide possessed the
sequence FIHHIIGGLFSAGKAIHRLIRRRRR, and the
C-terminus was amidated. The peptide was synthesized
by GL Biochem (Shanghai, China) using a solid-phase
procedure of Fmoc chemistry [29, 64]. Crude peptides
were extracted, lyophilized, and purified by reversephase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
The molecular masses and purity of the fractionated
peptide were verified by mass spectroscopy and HPLC,
respectively. The obtained synthetic peptide was >95%
pure, and the peptide was freshly reconstituted in PBS to

generate working stocks prior to each experiment.

In vitro anti-H. pylori assessment

Overnight cultures of H. pylori were scraped and
adjusted to OD 0.05, and 1 ml/tube inocula were prepared
with BHI broth. Solutions of TP4 or clinical antibiotics
were prepared with concentrations corresponding to
their respective MIC, and PBS was used as a control.
The tubes were incubated without shaking at 37ºC under
microaerophilic conditions, and sample aliquots were
taken at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hr. The samples were serially
diluted, and appropriate dilutions were plated in triplicate
onto blood agar plates for bacterial counts. The results
were expressed as mean log (c.f.u. mL-1) with standard
error.

Frozen cultures were streaked onto BHI agar
with 10% sheep blood, and incubated for 24 hr under
microaerophilic conditions [65]. H. pylori cells
undergoing exponential growth were suspended in sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and adjusted to 0.05 OD
using BHI broth; the resulting inoculum was dispensed
onto a microtitre plate. Peptide TP4 was prepared at
various concentrations (0.04 to 50 µg mL-1) using PBS.
Antibiotic resistant clinical isolate CI-HC-028 and three
reference strains were used for susceptibility testing. All
plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions
at 37°C overnight. The MIC was defined as the lowest
concentration of the drug at which there was no visible
growth. For quality control and comparative analyses,
we examined the susceptibility of all four H. pylori
strains to the antibiotics amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and
metronidazole (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).

Membrane perturbation assay based on N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) uptake
The NPN membrane permeation assay was
performed as described previously [66]. Briefly, a starter
culture of H. pylori was grown overnight to 0.05 OD. The
adjusted culture was aliquoted into different tubes with or
without TP4/amoxicillin, and incubated at 37ºC for 360
minutes under microaerophilic conditions. The cells were
washed and resuspended in PBS to a final volume of 250
µl in the presence of 22µg mL-1 of NPN. Tubes containing
PBS with NPN and bacterial cells with NPN served as
controls. NPN fluorescence intensity was recorded using a
Synergy HT (BioTek, U.S.A) fluorescence ELISA reader,
and correlated to membrane potential and permeation.
Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results
are expressed as means with standard error.

Dose- and time-dependent effects of TP4
TP4 peptide solutions (100 µl) at concentrations
corresponding to 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 fold the MIC were
prepared and added to an equal volume of solution
containing bacterial counts of approximately 107 c.f.u.
mL-1 in each well of a 96-well plate. The plates were
incubated at 37°C, and samples were collected at 1, 3,
6, 12, and 24 h. Samples were diluted to the indicated
amounts, and plated in triplicate onto blood agar plates;
bacterial counts were determined after incubation under
microaerobic conditions at 37°C for 24 hr. The results
were expressed as mean log (c.f.u. mL-1) with standard
error.

Effect of TP4 on H. pylori surface charge
Zeta potential studies were performed at room
temperature using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern
Instruments, Worcestershire, UK) equipped with a 633nm HeNe laser [36]. TP4 at the MIC was prepared. A 100
µl volume of each peptide stock dilution was added to
900 µl (0.5 OD) of H. pylori in liquid culture/blood agar
cultures. Positive controls contained filtered buffer instead
of peptide. The bacterial suspensions were dispensed into
disposable zeta cells with gold electrodes, and allowed
to equilibrate for 15 min at 25 °C. The zeta potential for
each sample was calculated. The complete experiment was
carried out twice for each peptide using independentlygrown cultures.

Induction of drug resistance
The drug resistance of bacteria to TP4 and clinical
antibiotics was determined by in vitro culturing of H.
pylori in sub-inhibitory concentrations of TP4 and
antibiotics, followed by repeated in vivo passaging
[52]. H. pylori was administered to C3H/HeN mice and
allowed to colonize the gut; subsequently pure colonies
of H. pylori were isolated on EYE selective media. This
step was repeated for 10 passages. During each passage,
the MICs of TP4 and the conventional antibiotics were
determined. All procedures, care, and handling of mice
were approved by the laboratory animal ethics committee
of National Taiwan Ocean University.

Assessment of H. pylori colonization

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis
of TP4-induced morphological changes in H.
pylori

Harvested stomach lysates were prepared and
serially diluted, and 100 µl aliquots were spread onto
EYE selective agar plates in duplicate. The plates were
incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 37ºC for
24-72 hr. Pink colonies (H. pylori) and total viable counts
were recorded.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used
to examine the mechanism of TP4 action on H. pylori,
overall cell morphology, TP4 translocation into H. pylori,
and binding of TP4 to internal constituents. H. pylori
overnight cultures from BHI-blood agar plates were
collected, and 0.1 OD inocula were incubated with TP4,
Amoxicillin, and/or PBS (PBS only: negative control).
Following drug exposure, H. pylori cells were collected
and successively washed twice in PBS by centrifugation
and resuspension. The cells were then fixed and processed
for TEM using previously described methods [67, 68].
The morphology of the cells was observed using an FEI
Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscope
(FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) operating at 80 keV [69]
at low-power magnification (X1100), and the cell wall
ultrastructure was observed at high-power magnification
(X2, 500/5,000/7,000, or X15, 000). Each grid was
examined under the same settings. Images were recorded
with a 4MP SPOT Insight charge-coupled-device (CCD)
camera.

Expression of H. pylori virulence factor genes
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from gastric
tissue lysates (25 µl) using the Tissue and Cell Genomic
DNA Purification Kit (GeneMark; DP021-50, Taiwan).
The concentration and quality of the DNA was determined
using a NanoDrop N1000 spectrophotometer. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) was performed using gene specific
primers (UreB F: 5’-GGC ACC ACT CCT TCT GCA
AT-3’ R: 5’-CAG CTG TTT GCC AAG TTC TGG-3’,
CagA F: 5’-GAT GTG AAA TCC CCG GGC TC-3’, R:
5’-ACT GCG ATC CGG ACT ACG AT-3’, internal control
16s rRNA F: 5’-ACG CGT CGA CAG AGT TTG ATC
CTG GCT-3’ R: 5’-AGG CCC GGG AAC GTA TTC AC3’ [71]) and 100 ng of gDNA as template. The resulting
PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2 %
agarose gel, and then stained with ethidium bromide [44].

Monotherapeutic efficacy of TP4 against H. pylori
infection in a mouse model

Western blotting
Male C3H/HeN mice were obtained from
BioLASCO Tawian, co., Ltd., and housed at the
Laboratory Animal Facility, National Taiwan Ocean
University, Taiwan. Mice were maintained in pathogenfree sterile isolators, and all food, water, caging, and
bedding were sterilized before use. All animal protocols
with reference number 96025 were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
of the College of Science, National Taiwan Ocean
University. For the H. pylori infection model, six-weekold male mice were randomly divided into three groups
of six mice each. To establish primary H. pylori infection,
mice were intragastrically challenged with ~1x109 c.f.u. of
H. pylori on two days, with an interval of 24 hr [70]. After
colonization (day 9 onwards), the mice were treated with
a monotherapeutic dose of TP4 (8 mg/kg) every day for
14 days; the control group received an equivalent volume
of PBS. Mice were sacrificed 2 wk post-treatment on day
22, and the gastric tissue was processed for urease activity,
quantification of H. pylori, Western blot, histopathology
analysis, T cell subset quantification, and gene expression
analysis.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Urease B protein was used as a marker to confirm
the presence of H. pylori in gastric tissue. Total lysate
protein (25 µg) was loaded onto a SDS gel and separated
by electrophoresis. The protein bands were then
transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After blotting, the
membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in TBS with 0.01%
Tween 20, and proteins were detected using Urease B
specific antibody. A chemiluminescence detector (UVP
BioSpectrum) was used to determine the relative intensity
of the protein bands.

Gastric tissue analyses
Gastric tissue biopsies were fixed in buffered
paraffin and embedded in paraffin wax. A section of about
5 µm was stained with hematoxylin and eosin to analyze
tissue inflammation. For staining against H. pylori, tissue
slides were deparaffinized with xylene and alcohol, and
then rehydrated in water. After washing in PBS, the tissue
section was incubated with modified Giemsa stain for 2-5
minutes, and then washed with PBS. Slides were fixed,
and sections were observed at different magnifications
under light microscopy. The tissues were evaluated as
described previously [72].

morbidity, mortality, and other clinical signs were recorded
and assessed. Dermal Toxicity was assessed by topical
application of TP4 at 10 times the effective dose to skin
at the dorsal side of mice [50, 76]. After administration,
the animals were kept under observation for a minimum
of 48 h. Clinical signs were noted if the animals were in
the morbid stage or presented with any abnormalities.
Eye irritation test in New Zealand white rabbits: Healthy
young adult rabbits were used in the experiment. Eyes
were treated with TP4, PBS (vehicle control), or 0.1%
SDS (positive control). A repeated dose of 1 mg/kg was
administered every day for 7 days. During the treatment
period, the eyes were examined on days 1, 3, 5, and 7,
and allowed to recover until day 14. Clinical signs were
recorded during the test period, and grades were assigned
for ocular reactions observed during each examination
[49]. All procedures, care, and handling of rabbits were
approved by the laboratory animal ethics committee of
National Taiwan Ocean University.

Flow cytometry was performed to quantify mice
splenic T cell subsets [73, 74]. Briefly, splenectomies
were performed on euthanized mice, and the spleens were
transferred into RPMI media. Spleens were minced and
passed through a 100 µl size mesh at room temperature,
and the single cell suspensions were pelleted at 1500 rpm
for 5 min. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 3
ml of RBC lysis buffer, and incubated for 5 min at room
temperature (RT) with gentle tapping to assist in lysis and
cell disintegration; the reaction was halted by the addition
of excess RPMI media. The mixture was centrifuged, and
the pellet was resuspended in RPMI media. The resulting
single cell suspension was aliquoted into flow cytometry
tubes (100 µl/tube). One microliter of fluorescent dyelabeled monoclonal antibody (T-cell subsets; CD4, Th17,
Treg) was added to each tube, and the volume was made
up to 500 µl with PBS. The tubes were covered with foil
and incubated in the dark for 1 hr at room temperature. A
BD FACS Canto-A flow cytometer was used to record the
percentages of T cell subsets.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed and graphs
were generated using SPSS 17.0, Graphpad 5.2 software.
Results are represented as means ± s.e.m. (standard error
of the mean). Statistical analyses were performed using
Student’s t–test, ANOVA. The criterion for significance
was set to p < 0.05.

Gastric cytokines and T cell marker gene
expression
Total RNA from stomachs of C3H/HeN mice was
prepared using the High Pure RNA Tissue Kit according to
the recommendations of the manufacturer (Roche, USA).
For cytokine mRNA quantification, 5 µg of total RNA
was converted into cDNA using a high capacity cDNA
archive kit (Invitrogen). Levels of interleukin IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-18, IL-10, IL-23, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF –α), TGF-β, and FoxP3 mRNA were measured by
Q-PCR using TaqMan gene expression assays for use in
the A CFX Connect™ Real-Time PCR Detection System
(Bio-Rad). Transcript levels were normalized to those
of mRNA of the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and expressed as the
fold change compared to samples from control mice using
the Comparative CT method (Bio-Rad).
