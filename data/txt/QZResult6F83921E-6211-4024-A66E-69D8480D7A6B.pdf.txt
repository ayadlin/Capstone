Abstract

Introduction

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric
brain tumor, and mechanisms underlying its development are
poorly understood. We identified recurrent amplification of
the miR-17/92 polycistron proto-oncogene in 6% of pediatric
medulloblastomas by high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays and subsequent interphase
fluorescence in situ hybridization on a human medulloblastoma tissue microarray. Profiling the expression of 427 mature
microRNAs (miRNA) in a series of 90 primary human
medulloblastomas revealed that components of the miR-17/
92 polycistron are the most highly up-regulated miRNAs in
medulloblastoma. Expression of miR-17/92 was highest in the
subgroup of medulloblastomas associated with activation of
the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway compared with
other subgroups of medulloblastoma. Medulloblastomas in
which miR-17/92 was up-regulated also had elevated levels of
MYC/MYCN expression. Consistent with its regulation by Shh,
we observed that Shh treatment of primary cerebellar granule
neuron precursors (CGNP), proposed cells of origin for the
Shh-associated medulloblastomas, resulted in increased miR17/92 expression. In CGNPs, the Shh effector N-myc, but not
Gli1, induced miR-17/92 expression. Ectopic miR-17/92 expression in CGNPs synergized with exogenous Shh to increase
proliferation and also enabled them to proliferate in the
absence of Shh. We conclude that miR-17/92 is a positive
effector of Shh-mediated proliferation and that aberrant
expression/amplification of this miR confers a growth advantage to medulloblastomas. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3249–55]

Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain
tumor, arises in the developing cerebellum (1). Lack of details
regarding the molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma hinders
the development of targeted therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are
small endogenous noncoding RNAs that play important roles in
many biological processes, including cancer (2). miR-17/92 is a
polycistronic cluster of highly conserved miRNAs that has been
shown to contribute to tumor development in both human and
murine cancers (3). miR-17/92 is located on chromosome 13 in
humans (chromosome 14 in mice); paralogous clusters also exist
including miR-106a/363 and miR-106b/25 (3). A role for miR-17/92
in medulloblastoma and cerebellar development has not been
described.
Cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP) are proposed cells
of origin for a subset of medulloblastomas. CGNPs undergo rapid
sonic hedgehog (Shh)–dependent expansion perinatally in mice
and humans, and excessive Shh pathway activity promotes
medulloblastoma (4). We show that miR-17/92 is amplified and
overexpressed in medulloblastoma, particularly in the medulloblastoma subgroup driven by Shh signaling. In addition, we show
that the miR-17/92 cluster is a target of Shh signaling through
N-myc activity in CGNPs. Overexpression of miR-17/92 synergized
with exogenous Shh in promoting CGNP proliferation and was able
to drive proliferation in the absence of Shh signaling. These
findings suggest that miR-17/92 is an essential component of the
Shh mitogenic signaling apparatus in CGNPs and that its upregulation downstream of aberrantly activated Shh contributes to
medulloblastoma.

Results and Discussion
The miR-17/92 cluster is recurrently amplified in medulloblastoma. We profiled 201 primary human medulloblastomas
using Affymetrix single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to
delineate recurrent copy number aberrations that may contribute

Figure 2. Overexpression of miR-17/92 in human and murine medulloblastomas. A, heatmap showing that components of the miR-17/92 polycistron (yellow box ) are
expressed at low levels in the normal cerebellum, are expressed at elevated levels in medulloblastomas, and cluster together based on their common pattern of
expression. Other miRs, including miR-375, miR-182, and miR-183, are also elevated in a subset of tumors. B, scatterplot analysis showing that components of miR-17/
92 and related paralogues (miR-106a and miR-106b clusters) are the most significantly up-regulated miRNAs in human medulloblastoma compared with normal
cerebellar samples (left ). Mature miRNAs are depicted as circles with diameter determined by the ratio of expression for a given miRNA in the brain versus other
tissues, and the colors reflect the parametric P values between the two classes. Performing the same analysis between medulloblastomas and normal cerebellum
without miR-17/92, miR-106a, and miR-106b clusters shows that only a few miRNAs independent of these clusters are significantly up-regulated in medulloblastoma
(right ). C, summary of the top 20 most significantly overexpressed miRNAs in medulloblastoma compared with normal cerebellum samples. Eleven (of 20) of the
significantly up-regulated miRNAs correspond to components of miR-17/92 or related paralogues, providing strong evidence in support of miR-17/92 overexpression in
medulloblastoma. D, Taqman qRT-PCR analysis of murine medulloblastomas from SmoA1 (top ) and Ptc+/ (bottom ) mice shows up-regulation of the miR-17/92 cluster
in tumors from both of these mouse models. Data for components of the miR-17/92 cluster (blue ) or controls (red) are represented as the fold change between
medulloblastomas from either SmoA1 or Ptc+/ mice and age-matched control cerebella.

miR-17/92 in Medulloblastoma and Neural Precursor Proliferation

to medulloblastoma pathogenesis (8). We identified two medulloblastomas with recurrent, focal, high-level amplification on chromosome 13q31.3, sharing a minimal common region that spans
f1.82 Mb (Fig. 1A). The only gene mapping to this amplified locus
is miR-17/92 (NCBI Build 36.1). Amplification of this miR cluster
has not previously been reported in medulloblastoma. Further
examination of the tumors harboring miR-17/92 amplification
revealed amplification of MYCN and GLI2 (Fig. 1A). We subsequently carried out interphase FISH on a medulloblastoma tissue
microarray to determine the incidence of miR-17/92 amplification
in a nonoverlapping series of 80 medulloblastomas. Low-level
amplification of miR-17/92 was identified in f6% (5 of 80) of cases
(Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results suggest that miR-17/92
functions as an oncogene in a subset of medulloblastomas.
miR-17/92 is overexpressed in human and murine medulloblastomas. We performed a genome-wide survey of 427 mature
miRNAs in a series of 90 primary human medulloblastomas and
10 normal human cerebella ( five fetal and five adult). Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering of samples and differentially expressed
miRNAs in the data set could easily discriminate medulloblastomas
from normal cerebella samples (Fig. 2A). Notably, components of
miR-17/92, including miR-18a, miR-19b, and miR-20a, as well as the
paralogous miR-106a (miR-106a/363 cluster) clustered together, were
expressed at low levels in the normal cerebella and showed considerably higher levels of expression in most medulloblastomas (Fig. 2A).
Statistical comparison of miRNA profiles for medulloblastomas
versus normal cerebella samples revealed consistent overexpression
of miR-17/92 and its related paralogues (miR-106a/363 and miR106b/25) in medulloblastoma (Fig. 2B, left and C; Supplementary
Table S1). Reanalysis of the data after removing the 22 probe sets,
which detect components of miR-17/92 or paralogous clusters, shows
that there are relatively few remaining overexpressed miRs in
medulloblastoma compared with normal cerebella (Fig. 2B, right).
As miR-17/92 was overexpressed in a large percentage of human
medulloblastomas compared with normal cerebella, we examined
its expression in murine medulloblastoma. Medulloblastomas
from NeuroD2-SmoA1 and Ptc+/ mice showed marked overexpression of the miR-17/92 cluster compared with cerebellum
from age-matched tumor-free littermates (Fig. 2D).
miR-17/92 up-regulation is associated with activated Shh
signaling in human medulloblastoma. Aberrant activation of the
Shh pathway through mutation of pathway members has been
documented in 25% to 30% of medulloblastomas (5, 9). To
subclassify the 90 medulloblastomas used in miRNA expression
profiling above, we performed mRNA expression analysis for 17,881
mRNAs on the same cohort of medulloblastomas. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering using 1,300 differentially expressed mRNAs
segregated four unique molecular subgroups: WNT (blue), SHH
(red), Group C (yellow), and Group D (green; Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). These four subgroups were

supported by their expression pattern (Supplementary Table S2)
and specific genomic features, including monosomy 6 (WNT),
chromosome 9q loss (SHH), and isochromosome 17q (Group C and
Group D; Fig. 3A). miR-17/92 was most highly expressed in the SHH
subgroup, followed by Group C, and the WNT subgroup (Fig. 3A
and B and Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table S3).
Confirming previous reports (10), we observed high MYCN
expression in the SHH tumors, whereas MYC levels were most
elevated in WNT and Group C tumors (Fig. 3A and Supplementary
Fig. 3). MYC and MYCN have both been reported to transcriptionally
regulate miR-17/92 (11, 12). We compared miR-17/92 expression
between tumors with higher MYCN/MYC expression to tumors with
lower expression to determine whether miR-17/92 regulation might
also be myc-dependent in medulloblastoma. As shown in Fig. 3C,
components of miR-17/92 (miR-17, miR-20a, miR-92a) and related
paralogues (miR-106a, miR-20b, miR-25, miR-93) represented the
majority of up-regulated miRNAs in medulloblastomas with higher
MYCN/MYC (n = 51) expression compared with lower expressing
MYCN/MYC (n = 39) tumors (Supplementary Table S4).
We carried out Taqman miRNA assays to validate the correlation
between MYCN/MYC and miR-17/92 expression observed on the
array platforms. Samples were divided into three groups of 10
tumors each: higher MYCN, higher MYC, and lower MYCN/MYC
and then quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was
performed for MYCN, MYC, miR-17, and miR-18. As predicted
from the mRNA array data, the high MYCN (P = 3.33E 08) and
high MYC (P = 3.33E 08) tumors did not overlap (Fig. 3D, top and
middle). Importantly, miR-17 (P = 4.92E 05) and miR-18 (P =
3.75E 05) were significantly up-regulated in both the higher MYCN
and higher MYC expressing groups compared with the lower
MYCN/MYC–expressing group (Fig. 3D, bottom). These results
provide strong evidence that up-regulation of the miR-17/92
polycistron may be MYCN/MYC–dependent in medulloblastomas.
miR-17/92 is up-regulated by Shh signaling in primary CGNP
cultures. To determine whether the relationship between activated
Shh signaling and miR-17/92 up-regulation we observed in
medulloblastomas reflected co-option of developmental programs,
we cultured murine CGNPs with or without exogenous Shh
(Fcyclohexamide) for 24 hours and then performed arraybased miRNA profiling. Of 599 mouse miRNAs assayed, 19 were
significantly changed, 9 were up-regulated, and 10 were downregulated (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S5). The miR-17/92
polycistron was up-regulated in Shh-treated CGNPs, but not in the
presence of cycloheximide, indicating that a new protein intermediate needs to be synthesized to regulate miR-17/92 expression.
Validation by qRT-PCR in Fig. 4B shows that the six miRNAs
within the miR-17/92 cluster were consistently up-regulated by
Shh, which was abrogated by cyclohexamide (data not shown).
These results indicate that the association between activated Shh
signaling and miR-17/92 expression is conserved between normal

Figure 3. miR-17/92 is overexpressed in SHH-dependent medulloblastomas and tumors with elevated MYC family expression. A, heatmap showing expression of
MYC, MYCN, and the miR-17/92 cluster suggests a strong correlation between miR-17/92 overexpression and the SHH subgroup as defined by molecular classification
of the 90 primary medulloblastomas used for miRNA profiling. Expression array analysis of protein-coding genes identifies four consistent subgroups: WNT (blue ),
SHH (red), Group C (yellow ), and Group D (green ). Classification of the subgroups into WNT, SHH, Group C, and Group D was achieved by comparing each
of the respective subgroups to the other three using t test statistics (see Supplementary Table S2). miR-17/92 expression is also elevated in the WNT and Group C
subgroups, both of which exhibit higher MYC expression, compared with Group D, which is characterized by lower MYC levels. B, representative miRNAs of the
four molecular subgroups described in A identified using t test statistics. miR-17/92 expression is highest in the SHH subgroup and lowest in Group D. C, division of the
medulloblastoma series into higher MYC/MYCN (n = 51) and lower MYC/MYCN (n = 39) expressing groups identifies highly significant up-regulation of miR-17/92
and related paralogues in the higher MYC/MYCN expressing tumors. Scatterplot analysis shows significant, differentially expressed miRNAs between the two groups of
medulloblastomas. D, qRT-PCR validation of the expression array data in a subset of medulloblastomas (n = 30) confirming the consistent correlation between
MYC/MYCN status and miR-17/92 expression.

miR-17/92 in Medulloblastoma and Neural Precursor Proliferation

Shh mitogenic activity in CGNPs and oncogenic Shh signaling in
medulloblastoma.
miR-17/92 induces proliferation of CGNPs downstream of
N-myc. We have previously shown that N-myc is a downstream
target of Shh whose induction is not protein synthesis dependent
and which can drive CGNP proliferation in the absence of Shh
signaling (7, 13). We asked whether miR-17/92 was regulated by
N-myc in CGNPs. We infected CGNPs with retroviruses carrying
N-myc or the stabilized mutant N-mycT50A that can prolong CGNP
proliferation in vitro (14). N-myc transduction resulted in increased
expression of the miR-17/92 cluster in the presence and absence of
Shh (Fig. 4C). In contrast, neither Gli1 nor Gli2 expression induced
miR-17/92 in the absence of Shh; indeed, Gli1 and Gli2 suppressed
Shh-mediated miR-17/92 expression. These results indicate that the
Shh pathway effectors N-myc and Gli regulate different miRNA
targets.
Because N-myc expression alone is sufficient to drive CGNP
proliferation, we asked whether miR-17/92 contributes to the
N-myc–regulated proliferation program. We infected CGNPs with
retroviruses expressing five of the six miRNAs within the miR-17/92
cluster (pWzl-miR-17-19b; ref. 15). After 48 hours, we measured
CGNP proliferation by quantifying Ki67 staining. Overexpression of
the miR-17/92 cluster increased proliferation in Shh-treated cells
(Fig. 4D). miR-17/92 alone was able to maintain cell proliferation in
the absence of Shh, albeit not at the same levels as Shh alone,
suggesting that its expression does not recapitulate the complete
Shh/N-myc proliferative response.
In summary, we have shown that miR-17/92 amplification and
overexpression are a hallmark of SHH-associated medulloblastoma

in humans and in mice and that its expression correlates with
high levels of MYC family proto-oncogenes. We also show that, in
normally proliferating CGNPs, miR-17/92 is a Shh target whose
expression is regulated by N-myc. Our finding that Shh regulates
expression of an oncogenic miRNA provides additional insights as
to the mechanisms through which Shh drives cell cycle progression. Our observation that miR-17/92 expression increases Shhmediated CGNP proliferation provides insight into its role in
human medulloblastoma, suggesting that high levels of miR-17/92
can provide cells with a selective growth advantage through an
enhanced proliferative capacity. A role for miR-17/92 in tumor cell
survival may also be at play, as its targets identified in lymphoma
include PTEN and the proapoptotic p53 target TP53INP1 (16, 17).
