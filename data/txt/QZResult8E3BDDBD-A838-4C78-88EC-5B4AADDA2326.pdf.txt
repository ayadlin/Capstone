Abstract
Xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) is an important DNA
damage recognition protein that binds to damaged DNA at a
very early stage during DNA repair. The XPC protein is also
involved in DNA damage–induced cell cycle checkpoint
regulation and apoptosis. XPC defects are associated with
many types of solid tumors. The mechanism of the XPC protein
in cancer progression, however, remains unclear. In this report,
we showed the strong correlation between bladder cancer
progression and attenuated XPC protein expression using
tissues derived from patients with bladder cancer. The results
obtained from our immunohistochemical studies further
revealed a strong correlation of XPC deficiency, p53 mutation,
and the degree of malignancy of bladder tumors. In addition,
the results obtained from our studies have also shown that
HT1197 bladder cancer cells, which carry a low-level XPC
protein, exhibited a decreased DNA repair capability and were
resistant to cisplatin treatment. When an XPC gene cDNAexpression vector was stably transfected into the HT1197 cells,
however, the cisplatin treatment–induced apoptotic cell death
was increased. Increased p53 and p73 responses following
cisplatin treatment were also observed in HT1197 cells stably
transfected with XPC cDNA. Taken together, these results
suggest that XPC deficiency is an important contributing factor
in bladder tumor progression and bladder cancer cell drug
resistance. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4578–85]

Introduction
Urinary bladder cancer is the fourth most common neoplasm
found in men from western countries, with urothelial cell
carcinoma being the most common subtype (1). The established
risk factors of bladder cancer include cigarette smoking, exposure
to industrially related aromatic amines, and the uptake of chemical
drugs such as cyclophosphamide. Because of the nature of bladder
as an important void organ, the urotherial cells are continuously
exposed to many DNA-damaging reagents contained in the urine.
Therefore, DNA repair plays an essential role in preventing
deleterious DNA damage–induced effects such as mutation
accumulation and tumor occurrence.
Several DNA repair pathways exist in mammalian cells, and each
pathway effectively removes particular types of DNA damage.

Based on the type of DNA damage, the DNA repair pathways can be
categorized into nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision
repair, mismatch repair, and recombinational repair [both homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining]. The
NER pathway is the major DNA repair pathway for repairing bulky
DNA damage generated by most environmental factors, such as UV
radiation, chemicals, and therapeutic drugs (e.g., cisplatin and
mitomycin). Therefore, the presence of a functional NER pathway is
essential for maintaining genetic integrity and for preventing the
development of many disease conditions from exposure to these
DNA-damaging reagents, such as cancer.
Xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) is a DNA damage
recognition protein that plays an important role in the NER
process. The XPC protein binds tightly with an HR23B protein to
form a stable XPC-HR23B complex (2, 3). Studies indicate that the
XPC-HR23B complex is the first protein component that recognizes
and binds to the damaged sites (4–9). The XPC protein might also
play an important role in other DNA damage–induced cellular
responses, including cell cycle checkpoint regulation and apoptosis
(10, 11). XPC defects have been found in many types of cancer,
including lung and skin cancer (12, 13). XPC knock-out transgenic
mice studies reveal the high incidence of a predisposition to many
types of cancer (12, 14–17). In addition, genetic studies also reveal a
strong association between XPC gene polymorphisms and the
occurrence of many types of cancer (18–21). In light of these
results, however, no studies have been done to directly investigate
the role of XPC defects in bladder cancer progression.
We have studied the relationship of XPC defects with bladder
cancer progression and cancer cell drug resistance. The results
obtained from our immunohistochemical studies using paraffin
wax–embedded tissues from bladder urothelial cell carcinomas
revealed a high incidence of reduced XPC protein expression in
these tissues. Statistical analysis of these immunohistochemical
data showed a strong correlation between XPC deficiency and the
degree of malignancy of bladder tumors. The correlation of XPC
deficiency/p53 mutation and the degree of malignancy of bladder
tumors is also statistically significant. The results obtained from
our bladder cancer cell culture studies also suggest a strong
correlation between a reduced XPC protein and an increased
resistance of bladder cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. These
results suggest that the XPC protein plays an important role in
preventing the occurrence of bladder cancer, and that the XPC
defects lead to a high incidence of bladder cancer occurrence and
bladder cancer cell resistance to cisplatin (treatment).

Materials and Methods

Beijing University. The HT1197 cells were maintained in MEM supplemented
with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The T24 cells were
maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The HeLa
cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The BIU-87 and
EJ bladder cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS.
The pXPC-3 plasmid, which carries an XPC gene cDNA, was kindly
provided by Dr. R. Legerski (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of
Texas, Austin, TX). A 3.4-kb DNA fragment containing the XPC gene cDNA
was further removed from the pXPC-3 plasmid DNA by SfiI digestion and
inserted into the SfiI site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to obtain the
pcDNA3-XPC plasmid.
Tissue sample and immunohistochemistry. The paraffin wax–
embedded tissues of bladder papillary urothelial carcinoma were collected
from patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor in
our department from 2002 to 2004, and a total of 55 tissue specimens were
used for this study. Archival materials from the 55 cases were retrieved from
the surgical pathology files. These tissues, according to the new WHO
classification (2004), were assigned pathologically to papillary urothelial
neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP; 16 cases), low-grade
papillary urothelial carcinoma (24 cases), and high-grade papillary
carcinoma (15 cases). The research was approved by the ethics board of
Southwest Hospital at the Third Military Medical University. Tissue sections
of 5 Am were deparaffinized, rehydrated in graded alcohols, and processed
using the streptavidin immunoperoxidase method (Zymed). In brief,
sections were submitted to antigen retrieval by microwave oven treatment
for 10 min in 0.01 mol/L of citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Slides were subsequently
incubated in 10% normal serum for 30 min, followed by an overnight
incubation at 4jC with the appropriately diluted primary antibody. The
goat anti-human XPC (D-18) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:100 dilution. The mouse monoclonal anti-human p53
(DO-1) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) recognizing an epitope located
between amino acids 11 and 25 was used at a 1:200 dilution. After the
primary antibody, samples were incubated with biotinylated anti-goat or
anti-mouse immunoglobulins for 15 min at 37jC, followed by streptavidin
peroxidase complexes for 15 min at 37jC. 3,3¶-Diaminobenzidine was used
as the chromogen, and hematoxylin was used as a nuclear counterstain.
Immunohistochemical evaluation was conducted by at least two
independent observers that scored the estimated percentage of tumor cells
showing nuclear staining, independently of signal strength. Results were
scored in urothelial carcinoma lesions by estimating the percentage of
tumor cells showing characteristic nuclear staining. An arbitrarily defined
10% cutoff was taken to classify the TCC data into categorical groups
(positive versus negative). The statistical analysis was done by SSCP v10.0
software (SPSS).
Western blot assay. The XPC (D-18), p53 (DO-1), p73 (E-4), and atubulin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The
cells were lysed with the mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce),
and the protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad detergentcompatible protein assay kit. For the Western blot analysis of XPC, cell
lysates (50 Ag total protein) were resolved by electrophoresis in a 10% SDSPAGE gel. The resolved polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to
a polyvinylidene diflouride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was
blocked in TBS-Tween 20 (0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk and
then incubated sequentially with the anti-XPC antibody (1:300), anti-p53
antibody (1:500), and anti-p73 antibody (1:200), followed by incubation with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-goat immunoglobulin G (IgG; for
XPC and p73) and anti-mouse IgG ( for p53). The presence of XPC, p53, and
p73 was visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(Amersham Biosciences). A monoclonal antibody against a-tubulin was
used at a dilution of 1:500 to verify protein loading.
Stable transfection of bladder cancer cells with pcDNA3-XPC
plasmid. The HT1197 cells were seeded onto 100-mm cell culture dishes
and cultured to 70% confluence. The cells were then transfected with the
pcDNA3-XPC plasmid DNA using a cationic lipid (LipofectAMINE 2000;
10 Ag plasmid DNA/50 AL LipofectAMINE/100-mm dish) for 6 h. As a
negative control, some cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 using a same

www.aacrjournals.org

protocol. The medium was replaced with fresh cell growth medium and
cultured for 48 h. The cells were further cultured in G418-containing
medium (500 mg/L; Sigma) for 2 weeks for selection of the G418-resistant
colonies. The colonies were subcultured, and the expression level of XPC
protein in the stably transfected cell lines was determined by Western blot.
Nuclear extract preparation. The nuclear extracts were prepared as
described previously with some modifications (22). Briefly, the cells were
harvested and washed twice with PBS. The cells were then resuspended in
buffer A [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L KCl,
and 0.5 mmol/L DTT] five times the packed cell pellet volume and
incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were lysed by 20 strokes of a Kontes
glass Dounce homogenizer (B type pestle). The homogenate was
centrifuged for 10 min at 25,000  g (4jC) to pellet nuclei. The nuclei
were resuspended in two volumes of buffer C [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9),
25% glycerol, 0.42 mol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA,
0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.5 mmol/L DTT]
and lysed by 20 strokes of a Kontes glass Dounce homogenizer (B type
pestle). The resulting suspension was stirred gently for 30 min at 4jC and
then centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000  g. The clear supernatant was
dialyzed against 50 volumes of buffer D [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9),
20% glycerol, 0.1 mol/L KCl, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, and
0.5 mmol/L DTT] at 4jC for 6 h. The dialysate was centrifuged at 25,000  g
for 20 min, and the supernatant was frozen as aliquots in liquid nitrogen.
In vitro DNA repair assay. The in vitro DNA repair synthesis assay was
done as described previously with some modification (23). Briefly, the
pcDNA3.1 plasmid was treated with 20 Amol/L cisplatin (Sigma) for 4 h to
introduce DNA damage. The DNA repair assay was done in a 25-AL reaction
mixture containing 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 mol/L KCl, 0.2 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 Ag plasmid DNA, 250 Amol/L each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 10 ACi
[a-32P]dCTP (ICN Pharmaceuticals), and 50 Ag nuclear extract. The
reactions were incubated at 30jC for 2 h and then digested with proteinase
K (100 Ag/mL) at 50jC for 30 min. The reaction products were extracted
with phenol/chloroform once, and the plasmid DNA was purified using a
Centricon 30 apparatus (Millipore). The plasmid DNA was then digested
with XhoI and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis using a 1% gel.
Visualization of the plasmid DNA and the incorporated [a-32P]dCTP was
achieved by ethidium bromide (EB) staining and autoradiography.
Quantification of the incorporated [a-32P]dCTP was determined using
Scion image densitometry software.
Colonogenic survival assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using colonogenic survival. Exponentially growing cells were plated at appropriate
densities in 100-mm dishes and exposed to varying concentration of
cisplatin (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 Amol/L) for 2 h after overnight attachment.
The cell were washed and cultured for 14 days in normal growth medium.
The cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies of >50
cells were counted, and the survival adjusted for plating efficiency of cell
types was calculated and plotted.
DNA fragmentation analysis. The adhered cells were gently trypsinized,
mixed with any unattached cells removed with the medium, and pelleted by
centrifugation. DNA was isolated from the pelleted cells using a unique
differential cellular lysis procedure that separates fragmented DNA released
only by apoptotic cells from the native intact DNA of unaffected cells by
centrifugation. The 13,000  g supernatant was treated with RNase A for
30 min at 37jC followed by proteinase K (100 Ag/mL) for 1 h at 45jC.
Aliquots of DNA corresponding to 1  106 cells were resolved by gel (1.2%
agarose) electrophoresis and visualized by EB staining. The apoptotic index
was calculated from the amounts determined for the fraction of released
fragmented DNA to the total DNA in the initial cell pellet.
Flow cytometry assay. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and incubated
at 37jC overnight. The cells were treated with either 20 or 40 Amol/L
cisplatin for 2 h. After washing completely, the cells were cultured in normal
growth medium. The cells were harvested at various time points (16, 24, and
48 h) and fixed with 70% ethanol. The cells were treated with propidium
iodide (Sigma) and RNase A (400 units) for 30 min at 4jC. Cellular DNA
content was analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton
Dickinson), and cell cycle analysis was carried out using ModFit 2.0
software (Becton Dickinson).

Results
Attenuated XPC expression coupled with an increased p53
mutation was correlated to the malignancy of bladder tumors.
To study the correlation of XPC defects to bladder cancer
progression, we first determined the levels of XPC protein in
paraffin-embedded bladder tumor tissues collected by our hospital
in the past 2 years. Because of the prevalence of p53 mutation in
cancer occurrence, we also determined the p53 mutation in these
paraffin-embedded bladder tumor tissues to define the relationship
of XPC deficiency and p53 mutation in bladder cancer progression.
We have taken advantage of immunohistochemistry in this study
because of the availability of paraffin-fixed clinical samples and the

reliability of the immunohistochemistry procedures. In addition,
the immunohistochemistry analysis can also help determine the
p53 mutation because a nuclear localization of p53 represents p53
mutations, which is a widely accepted consensus in most p53
studies (24, 25).
The results obtained from our immunohistochemical studies
revealed that a majority of the XPC protein was localized nuclearly
with both the nucleus and nuclear membrane stained with the
XPC antibody (Fig. 1). Only a small amount of XPC protein was
presented in the cytoplasm as evidenced by the very faint stain of
the cytoplasm with the XPC antibody (Fig. 1). We further analyzed
the correlations of XPC deficiency and p53 mutation in bladder
cancer occurrence. The results obtained from the immunohistochemical studies indicated that the XPC-deficient phenotype
[XPC()] was present in 12.5% of PUNLMP cases (2/16), 33.3% of
low-grade cases (8/24), and 80% of high-grade cases (12/15), and
the p53 mutation phenotype [p53(+)] was observed in 6.2% of
PUNLMP cases (1/16), 33.3% of low-grade cases (8/24), and 66.7%
of high-grade cases (10/15; Table 1). In the case of co-occurrence of
both XPC deficiency and p53 mutation, the results obtained from
the immunohistochemistry stain revealed that the XPC()/p53(+)
phenotype was present in 8.3% of low-grade cases (2/24) and 53.3%
of high-grade cases (8/15) for the tested bladder tumor tissues.
Interestingly, the XPC()/p53(+) phenotype was not detected in
any of the PUNLMP cases (0/16). The statistical analysis of the
immunohistochemistry data indicated that the occurrence rate
of attenuated XPC expression was the highest in the high-grade
tumors (compared with both the PUNLMP and the low-grade
tumors; P < 0.01). No statistical difference was observed between
the PUNLMP and low-grade tumors (P > 0.05). The incidence
of p53 mutation was also higher in the high-grade tumors than
that of the PUNLMP tumors (P < 0.01), but no statistical difference
between the high- and low-grade tumors was seen (P > 0.05;
Table 1). Interestingly, the coincidence of both XPC deficiency and
p53 mutation was also higher in the high-grade tumors than in
those of the PUNLMP and low-grade tumors (P < 0.01). These
results suggest that an attenuated expression of the XPC protein is
indeed correlated with the degree of malignancy of bladder tumors.
These results also suggest a possible synergistic effect of attenuated
XPC expression and p53 mutation in the progression of bladder
cancer.
The expression level of XPC protein was varied among
individual bladder cancer cell lines. To further investigate a
molecular mechanism of XPC protein in the carcinogenesis
process, we extended our studies to bladder cancer cell lines.

Attenuated Expression of XPC in Human Bladder Cancer

repaired in the HeLa nuclear extracts as confirmed by the
incorporation of [a-32P]dCTP into the plasmid DNA (an 8.3-fold
increase over the undamaged plasmid; (Fig. 2B, lane 2 versus
lane 1). In contrast, a lower DNA repair activity was detected when
the cisplatin-damaged plasmid DNA was incubated with HT1197
nuclear extracts (a 4-fold increase over the undamaged plasmid
DNA; Fig. 2B, lane 4 versus lane 3). This result suggests that the
presence of low-level XPC protein in the HT1197 cells significantly
reduced its DNA repair capacity for cisplatin-caused DNA damage.

reactions was calculated as a percentage to the background. Lane 1, pcDNA3

Although the XPC gene polymorphism has been associated with a
risk of urinary bladder cancer, no studies have been conducted to
determine the expression level of the XPC protein in various
bladder cancer cells. Therefore, we determined the XPC protein
level in four bladder cancer cell lines, HT1197, T24, BIU-87, and EJ
(Fig. 2A). HeLa cells were used as a positive control for this study
because the HeLa cells are proficient in DNA repair, especially in
NER. Three of the tested bladder cancer cells, T24, BIU-87, and EJ,
displayed similar levels of XPC protein when compared with the
HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the level of XPC protein was much
lower in HT1197 bladder cancer cells than that of the HeLa cells
(Fig. 2A). Being equivalent to high-grade tumor cells, the HT1197
cells are an advanced and aggressive form of bladder cancer. These
results suggest that different bladder cancer cells carry different
levels of XPC protein. Because the heterogenicity is the hallmark
for bladder cancer cells, this result suggests that the expression
level of the XPC protein in bladder cancer cells is related not only
to cell types but also to the heterogenicity or pathology grade of the
bladder tumors.
The decreased DNA repair abilities of HT1197 cells. Although
XPC gene mutations and polymorphisms have been linked to
defective DNA repair and the predisposition of many types of
cancer (12, 18–21), it is unknown if an attenuated XPC expression
level would affect the DNA repair capacity of the cells. To
determine if the low-level XPC protein in HT1197 is sufficient for
DNA repair of the cells, the DNA repair abilities of HT1197 cells
were measured using an in vitro DNA repair assay (22), and the
HeLa nuclear extracts were used as a positive control for this study
(Fig. 2). The cisplatin-damaged plasmid DNA was effectively

Overexpression of XPC protein resulted in an increased
sensitivity of HT1197 bladder cells with cisplatin treatment. To
further investigate the role of XPC protein in bladder cancer cell
resistance to cisplatin treatment, we transfected the HT1197 cells
with an XPC gene cDNA-expressing vector, and the cells that stably
overexpressed the XPC protein were selected (Fig. 3A). The results
obtained from our Western blotting indicated that clones 2 and 3
expressed much higher levels of XPC protein than the untransfected HT1197 or the empty vector–transfected HT1197 cells
(Fig. 3A). Therefore, clone 2 was used to further study the role of
XPC overexpression in cisplatin treatment–induced cell killing.
We determined the role of XPC overexpression in cisplatin
treatment–induced cell killing using a colonogenic survival assay.
Both HT1197 and XPC gene cDNA-stably transfected HT1197 cells
were treated with cisplatin and plated onto tissue culture dishes to
allow for surviving cells to form colonies. As a control, the empty
vector–stably transfected HT1197 cells were also treated with
cisplatin and plated onto tissue culture dishes to allow for surviving
cells to form colonies (Fig. 3B). The cell survival rate was determined
with the number of colonies formed after the cisplatin treatment
(Fig. 3B). All three groups of HT1197 cells displayed a dosedependent decrease in the number of surviving colonies following
cisplatin treatment. However, the XPC stable–expressing HT1197
cells (HT1197/XPC) were relatively more sensitive to cisplatin
treatment than the untransfected or the empty vector–transfected

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

HT1197 cells. No apparent difference was found between the
untransfected and the empty vector–transfected HT1197 cells with
regard to their sensitivity to the cisplatin treatment. This result
suggests that the overexpression of the XPC protein resulted in an
increased sensitivity of HT1197 cells to cisplatin treatment.
Overexpression of XPC protein caused an increased apoptotic cell death of HT1197 cells after cisplatin treatment. One
of the important mechanisms for cisplatin’s killing effect is the
induction of apoptosis (26). Because the HT1197 cells with
overexpressed XPC protein displayed an increased sensitivity to
cisplatin, we further determined whether this increased sensitivity
was caused by apoptotic cell death. Both HT1197 and HT1197/XPC
cells were treated with cisplatin (0, 10, and 20 Amol/L) for 2 h and
then cultured for 48 h. The cells were harvested, and the cell lysates
were evaluated for DNA fragmentation analysis (Fig. 3C). A
negligible amount of DNA fragmentation was seen in HT1197 cells
treated with 10 Amol/L cisplatin (Fig. 3C, lane 6). In comparison, a
greatly increased amount of DNA fragmentation was detected in
the HT1197/XPC cells treated with cisplatin at the same
concentration (Fig. 3C,lane 3 versus lane 6). This result suggests
that the increased sensitivity of the HT1197/XPC cells was caused
by the cisplatin treatment–induced apoptosis.
The XPC protein was required for cisplatin treatment–
induced cell cycle regulation. The DNA damage checkpoint is a
multistep cellular response, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair,

Attenuated Expression of XPC in Human Bladder Cancer

and/or apoptosis. Because XPC is the first protein component that
binds to damage DNA sites, we postulated that the XPC protein
might serve as an important sensor protein in the DNA damage
checkpoint process. Therefore, we determined the role of the XPC
protein in cisplatin treatment–mediated cell cycle regulation using
a flow cytometry assay (Fig. 4). Consistent with many reports, no
obvious G1-S arrest response was observed in either HT1197 or
HT1197/XPC cells; instead, a predominant S-phase arrest was seen
in both HT1197 and HT1197/XPC cells following the cisplatin
treatment (Fig. 4A–C). The S-phase arrested cell population
reached the highest point (80%) at 16 h after 40 Amol/L cisplatin
exposure. Comparison of the flow cytometry data indicated no
significant difference between HT1197 and HT1197/XPC cells in
the cisplatin treatment–induced S-phase arrest, suggesting that the
XPC protein does not play an important role in the cisplatin
treatment–induced S-phase checkpoint (P > 0.05).
Accompanied with the initial S-phase arrest, the G2-M arrest
appeared 24 h after the cisplatin treatment, and it reached the peak
point at 48 h after the treatment. For the controls, only a small
proportion of the untreated HT1197 and HT1197/XPC cells were at
the G2 phase (10% and 14%, respectively; Fig. 4D and E). However,
the cisplatin treatment led to an increase in G2 cell population.
Importantly, more G2-arrested cell population was observed in the
HT1197/XPC cells than the HT1197 cells following the cisplatin
treatment (Fig. 4B and C): the cisplatin treatment caused an increase
of the G2-arrested cells from 29% to 36% in HT1197 cells, whereas the
same treatment resulted in an increase of the G2-arrested cells from
40% to 55% in the HT1197/XPC cells (Fig. 4C; P < 0.05). The increased
G2-arrested cell population in the HT1197/XPC cells suggests that
the XPC protein plays an important role in the G2-M checkpoint
process in response to cisplatin treatment, and a decrease in XPC
protein results in reduced G2-M arrest under cisplatin treatment.
The XPC deficiency was correlated with attenuated p53 and
p73 induction following cisplatin treatment. The results
described above suggest an important role of the XPC protein in
the cisplatin treatment–induced cellular response. However, the
signal transduction pathway initiated from the XPC protein DNA
damage recognition signal is not well understood. Although the
tumor suppressor protein p53 is known to play an important role
in DNA damage–induced cell cycle checkpoint regulation and
apoptosis, at least two different signaling pathways, one dependent
on p53 and the other independent of p53 but dependent on p73,
exist in mammalian cells (27). To elucidate the mechanism of XPC
protein in cisplatin treatment–induced checkpoint and apoptotic
response, the cisplatin treatment–mediated p53 and p73 responses
were determined in both HT1197 and HT1197/XPC cells (Fig. 5A
and B). Both p53 and p73 displayed a dose-dependent response
following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5). However, the cisplatin
treatment–induced p53 and p73 responses were much weaker in
HT1197 cells than in HT1197/XPC cells. As an internal control, the
level of a-tubulin remained unchanged in both HT1197 cells and
HT1197/XPC cells with or without the cisplatin treatment. These
data are consistent with the results obtained from our previous
studies, which revealed that the XPC protein is involving in the
cisplatin treatment–induced p53 responses (10). The results
obtained from this study provide the initial clue that the XPC
protein DNA damage recognition signal causes cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis through the activation of both p53- and p73-dependent
apoptotic pathways. However, further work needs to be done for
elucidating the mechanism by which XPC regulates p53 and p73
responses to cisplatin treatment.

Discussion
In this report, we have studied the role of XPC deficiency in
bladder tumor progression. Our results showed a strong correlation
between attenuated XPC expressions and the degree of malignancy
of bladder tumor cells. In addition, we have also studied the role of
the XPC protein in DNA damage–induced cellular responses. The
results obtained from our study suggest that the XPC protein plays
an essential role in cisplatin treatment–induced cellular responses,
including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis.
It is known that the genomes of living organisms are insulted
continuously by DNA-damaging agents both endogenously and
exogenously. In response to this DNA damage, two important
mechanisms, DNA repair and cell apoptosis, are used to overcome
the DNA damage–induced deleterious effects such as mutation
accumulation and uncontrolled cell proliferation. The initial
response following DNA damage detection is cell cycle arrest,
which allows DNA repair to take place and DNA damage to be
removed. However, if DNA damage exceeds the capacity of DNA
repair, an appropriate switching mechanism takes place that allows
the damaged cells to undergo an apoptotic cell death process. DNA
repair is important for restoring normal function in the damaged
cells, and apoptosis is essential in eliminating the severely
damaged cells. Given the fact that reduced apoptosis is observed
in most types of cancer, it is important to understand the
mechanism by which DNA damage leads to apoptosis. In recent
years, a subset of DNA repair proteins has been identified that
serve as triggering proteins for cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA
repair. Some apoptotic proteins have also been linked with the
DNA repair process. These proteins include ATM, ATR, BRCA1,
DNA-PK, XPB, XPD, p53, INGING1b, PARP, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and
MSH6, which are termed as DNA repair/proapoptotic dual-role
proteins (28). Regarding the XPC protein, the results obtained from
our recent study suggest an important role in cisplatin treatment–
induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (10). This result,

together with the results obtained from our mutagenesis study
(23) and other reports using XPC gene knock-out mice studies
(12, 15, 16, 29), strongly suggests that the XPC protein plays a
critical role in preventing cancer progression and malignancy
through its important functions in the DNA repair, cell cycle
checkpoint regulation, and apoptosis pathways.
We have studied the mechanisms by which XPC defects lead to
cancer progression. The results obtained from our previous studies
have revealed the requirement of the p53 signaling pathway in the
XPC protein DNA damage recognition–mediated signaling process
(10). The results obtained from this study further show a reduced
p53 response of HT1197 bladder cancer cells following cisplatin
treatment, and this p53 response was partially restored when an
XPC gene cDNA expression vector was stably transfected into
the HT1197 cells. Therefore, these data are consistent with the
results obtained from our previous studies. In addition, the results
obtained from this study also reveal that the XPC protein is
required for regulating p53 in bladder cancer cells following
cisplatin treatment, which suggests that the XPC protein may act
as one of the upstream activators of the p53 protein for the
cisplatin treatment–induced cellular responses. Many studies have
shown the important role of the p53 protein in DNA damage–
induced cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Studies also revealed that
defects of the p53 protein attributed to the increased resistance
attenuated cell cycle arrest, reduced DNA repair activity, and
decreased apoptosis following cisplatin treatment. The results
obtained from this study provide further evidence to suggest the
important role of the XPC protein in cisplatin treatment–induced
apoptosis of bladder cancer cells (Figs. 3–5).
In addition, the results obtained from this study also suggest the
involvement of the p73 signaling pathway, a p53-independent
signaling pathway, in the cisplatin treatment–induced cellular
responses. Because frequent p53 mutations were found in the
majority of cancer patients, these results suggest an important
alternative mechanism for cisplatin treatment–induced cell killing
in these p53-mutant cancer cells. Therefore, the knowledge
obtained from this study has important clinical importance in
the treatment of p53-mutant cancer cells.
Although our studies focused on determining the roles of the
XPC protein in bladder cancer progression and bladder cancer cell
resistance to cisplatin treatment, it is worthy to mention that the
p53 protein can also regulate the XPC protein following DNA
damaging treatment (30–32). It is possible that both the XPC and
p53 proteins can regulate each other in response to DNA damaging
treatment. Because the XPC-HR23B complex quickly recognizes
and binds to the damaged DNA template, it is possible that the
XPC protein may serve as a DNA damage sensor to activate the p53
protein. As a consequence, the active p53 protein may further
regulate the transcription of important DNA damage–responsive
genes, including XPC, resulting in cell cycle arrest to allow for DNA
repair and apoptosis to take place.

The hallmarks of cancer cells are high recurrence, high genetic
instability, and frequent drug resistance. Cancer progression is
associated with multiple gene defects or mutations. One of the
characteristics of bladder cancer is the heterogenesis of the
recurrent tumors, which is usually accompanied with a gradual
progressed malignancy and genetic alterations when compared
with the original tumors (33–36). The cause of this disease,
however, remains unclear. The results obtained from this study
have shown the strong correlation between XPC deficiency/p53
mutation and the degree of malignancy of bladder cancer. It is
possible that either attenuated XPC expression or p53 mutation
will reduce the proper cellular responses of bladder epithelial cells
to the continuous DNA damaging exposure, leading to an
accumulation of mutations in other genes and resulting in an
acceleration in bladder tumor progression. The results obtained
from our recent studies using breast cancer cells also support this
hypothesis: the breast cancer cells that overexpress an error-prone
DNA polymerase iota result in elevated mutation accumulation
following DNA damaging treatment (37).
Although we determined the role of XPC deficiency in bladder
cancer progression, the evoking factors that lead to XPC deficiency
are still unknown. Besides the observed XPC gene polymorphism,
several potential mechanisms can affect the level of XPC
expression: the XPC gene mutation, the transcriptional regulation,
and the protein degradation. The recent discovery of small
ubiquitin-related modifier–related post-translational modification
of XPC may provide some new insight into the stabilization of the
XPC protein (38). Regarding the XPC gene defects, a loss of
heterozygosity of chromosomes 3p, 17p, and 9p are frequently
observed in human bladder cancer patients. Some tumor
suppressor genes have already been identified within these sites,
such as p53, which is located on chromosome 17p, and p16, which
is located on chromosome 9p. However, no candidate genes
associated with bladder cancer are identified at the chromosome
3p region. It is possible that the XPC gene, which is located on the
3p25 region, can be one of the candidate genes for the 3p deletion
that leads to bladder tumor progression (39, 40).
