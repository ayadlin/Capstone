ABSTRACT
Resveratrol (RES) is the most effective natural products used for the treatment
of a variety of cancers. In this study, we tested the effect of RES in enhancing the
efficacy of docetaxel (DTX) treatment in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. The C4-2B and
DU-145 cell lines were treated with RES, DTX and combination followed by evaluating
the apoptosis and cell cycle progression. The combined drug treatment up-regulates
the pro-apoptotic genes (BAX, BID, and BAK), cleaved PARP and down regulates
the anti-apoptotic genes (MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL) promoting apoptosis. In C4-2B
cells the combination up regulated the expression of p53, and cell cycle inhibitors
(p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP), which, in turn, inhibited the expression of CDK4, cyclin D1,
cyclin E1 and induced hypo-phosphorylation of Rb thus blocking the transition of
cells in the G0/G1 to S phase. In contrast, the synergistic effect was not profound in
DU145 due to its lesser sensitivity to DTX. The suppression of cyclin B1 and CDK1
expression in both cell lines inhibits the further progression of cells in G2/M phase.
The current study demonstrates that combination treatment blocks the cell cycle
arrest by modulation of key regulators and promotes apoptosis via p53 dependent
and independent mechanism in PCa.

molecule because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory
and growth inhibitory effects, and is also known to be
advantageous in cardiovascular diseases [6–8]. It has
been reported to modulate several apoptotic (PARP,
Cleaved Caspases), pro-apoptotic (BAX, BID, BNIP3,
BAK) and anti-apoptotic (MCL-1, BCL-XL, BCL-2)
proteins, but very few reports are available regarding
the underlying mechanisms defining the interactions of
those key players involved in the cell cycle progression
and cell death. Previous studies showed that RES induced
anti-proliferation/apoptosis in various cancers, such as
prostate, breast, colon, gastric and melanoma [5, 9–11],
and was also found to be involved in the inhibition of ABC
transporters, and regulation of several pathways such as
PTEN/AKT [5].
The relationship between cell cycle and apoptosis
was evident in the role of p53, which is a well-known
tumor suppressor gene that induces the target genes
p21WAF1/CIP1 and BAX for cell cycle arrest and cell death

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most leading
causes of cancer-related death worldwide. In 2016,
approximately 180,890 cases of PCa were newly
diagnosed and 26,120 deaths have been estimated in
the United States [1]. Chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel
(DTX) is a well-known microtubule-stabilizing agent
and commonly used during the treatment of hormonerefractory PCa patients [2]. Unfortunately, long-term
treatment of DTX acquired resistance in PCa is due to
microtubule mutations and activation of drug efflux pumps
[3, 4]. There are many apoptosis regulators, genetic and
epigenetic factors involved in the initiation, progression,
and metastasis of human PCa malignancy [5].
Resveratrol (RES) (3,4,5-trihydroxystilbene),
a polyphenolic phytoalexin is commonly available in
natural compounds such as grapes, berries, peanuts,
and soybeans. RES is a promising chemopreventive

[12]. Cell proliferation is mediated by several signaling
molecules and checkpoints (CDKs) that regulate cell
division. The progression through the cell cycle is
positively regulated by cyclins (D and E)/cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDK4, CDK6, and CDK2) complex, which
phosphorylates retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (pRb)
protein for the transition of cells from G1 to S phase, with
the release of the E2F transcription factors. However, the
kinase inhibitor proteins p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1 and p57 KIP2
binds to cyclin D/ CDKs (4 or 6) complex or cyclin E/
CDK2 complex and block G1/S transition. Other protein
families (e.g. INK4) were also reported to bind to the
cyclin/CDKs involved and inhibiting the progression of
G1 phase. Besides these, CDK1/cyclin (A or B) complex
mediates the role of cell cycle progression into G2 and M
phase [13].
Previous studies suggested that RES inhibited
the cell proliferation by interfering with the several
transcriptional factors. Another study on RES reveals that
lack of apoptosis is regulated by the cell cycle inhibitors
(p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1 and p53), cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDKs) and other transcription factors [7, 14]. Several
reports have demonstrated that RES interfere in the cell
cycle progression by blocking the G1/S or G2/M phase
on different cancers [15–17]. The p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1
expressions are induced by p53, which is a well-known
inhibitor of CDKs family proteins. Previous reports
have also shown that p21WAF1/CIP1 plays an important role
in apoptosis by inducing pro-apoptotic and inhibiting
the anti-apoptotic proteins, and it also lead to cell cycle
arrest in androgen-dependent and independent PCa cell
lines. Moreover, less expression of p27KIP1 was reported
to be associated with the aggressiveness of PCa [18, 19].
The androgen receptor was reported to regulate the G1/S
transition, CDKs activity, and pRb gene, which controls
the androgen-dependent cell proliferation in PCa [20].
Therefore, triggering the pathways for apoptosis and
blocking the cell cycle progression could be the new
approach for the treatment of PCa.
In the current study, we used resveratrol (RES), a
natural compound with chemopreventive potential, to test
its ability to enhance the effectiveness of docetaxel (DTX),
as well as, to explore the property of the combined drug
treatment (RES+DTX) in the cell cycle modulation of
androgen independent (AI) PCa cell lines.

The viability assay determined the optimal IC50 values of
RES, DTX and combination of drugs for apoptosis in C42B and DU145 cells. In order to establish whether or not
the collective effects of RES and DTX were synergistic,
the combination index (CI) was calculated according to
the Chou and Talalay median effect principle [21]. Drugs
were applied to PCa cells at concentration relative to
their respective IC50 values keeping the ratio of one drug
to the other constant. The relative growth rates were
calculated in comparison with PCa cells in the absence
of any cytotoxic drugs. The C4-2B cells had IC50 values,
47μM (RES), 10nM (DTX) and DU145 cells had 35μM
(RES), 31nM (DTX). The combination Index was found
to be 0.56 (CI= 0.56) in C4-2B cells treated with 20μM
RES and 10nM DTX and 0.87 (CI=0.87) for DU145
cells treated with 22μM RES and 10nM DTX after 48h
of treatment. This data suggests that the synergistic effect
of RES+DTX was more efficient in C4-2B cell line
compared to DU145 cell line after 48 h of treatment. To
determine the viability, cells were stained, which gives the
blue and green color of live and dead nuclei, respectively.
These immunofluorescent images (Figure 1A) further
confirm that in both C4-2B and DU145 cells, dead nuclei
were found within the cells treated by the combination of
RES+DTX compared to RES or DTX alone.
To evaluate the synergistic effect of resveratrol and
docetaxel on apoptosis, PCa cell lines were treated with
47μM (RES), 10nM (DTX), 20μM +10nM (RES+DTX)
for C4-2B and 35μM (RES), 31nM (DTX), 22μM+10nM
(RES+DTX) for DU145 for 48 h and upon treatment, cells
were stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI and analyzed
by FlowJo software version 10.2. In the Figure 1B, data
were shown in quadrant Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4, which
represent necrotic [Annexin (-)/ PI (+)], late apoptotic
[Annexin (+)/ PI (+)], viable [Annexin (-)/PI (-)] and
early apoptotic [Annexin (+)/PI (-)] cells respectively.
In C4-2B cells, apoptosis induced by a combination of
drugs was significantly higher (early 36.6% and 19.4%
late) compared to the cell treated with DTX (early 26.6%
and late 15.3%) and RES (early20.5% and late 8.5%)
only. However, the combined treatment of (RES+DTX)
in DU145 cells showed early, and late apoptosis, which is
29.6% and 19.8%, respectively, compared to DTX (early
20.3% and late 9.5%) and RES (early 8.9% and late 7.6%)
alone. These results signify the role of RES in combination
with DTX, which induced the apoptosis in both PCa cells.

anti-apoptotic protein in PCa cells

Effect of resveratrol and docetaxel alone or
in combination on viability, cytotoxicity, and
apoptosis of PCa cells

To determine the effectiveness of RES induced
apoptosis in PCa, cells were treated with a known
concentration of RES, DTX, and RES+DTX for 48 h.
Expression of the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in C42B cells after treatment of RES (47μM), DTX (10nM)
and combination (RES+DTX, 20μM+10nM) showed

The cytotoxic effect of resveratrol (RES) at 24 and
72 h was not effectve, but at 48 h, resveratrol-induced
apoptosis was prominent in a dose-dependent manner
either alone or in combination with docetaxel (DTX).

that the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes (BAX, BID,
and BAK) and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes
(MCL-1, BCL-2, and BCL-XL), the changes in the protein
expressions were normalized to GAPDH expression.
The up-regulation of apoptotic marker cleaved PARP
expression in the cells treated with the combination of
drugs confirms the effectiveness of the RES and DTX
in inducing apoptosis (Figure 2A). In DU145, cells were
treated with the doses of RES (35μM), DTX (31nM) and
combination (RES+DTX, 22μM+10nM) and after 48 h the
cell death was monitored. The pro-apoptotic genes (BAK,
BID, and BAX) were up- regulated in which BAX and BID

expression were more significant in the cells treated with
both the drugs. The down-regulation of the expression
of the anti-apoptotic gene MCL-1 was more prominent
in the cells treated with both the drugs compared to BCL-2
and BCL-XL as shown in densitometry (Figure 2B). Our
results further demonstrated that the combined treatment
enhanced the expression of cleaved PARP in C42B
compared to DTX or RES solely; however, no significant
difference was found in DU145 for cleaved PARP
expression when treated with DTX alone or in combination
with RES. These results indicate that resveratrol induces
the pathway of apoptosis thus facilitating cell death.

processed for immunofluorescent staining. It showed abundant expression of live nuclei in control compare to any treatment group, whereas
the number of dead nuclei was more within the cells treated with the combination of both drugs. Similarly; in DU145 cells, most of the
dead nuclei were found in the treatment of RES+DTX (22μM, 10nM) compared to the control (DMSO +Cells), (RES (35μM) or DTX

combination of drug (RES+DTX) for both PCa cell lines. Data are representative mean of three independent experiments ± s.d.

cells

(BAX, BID, and BAK) and anti-apoptotic (BCL-2, BCLXL, and MCL-1) markers in C4-2B and DU145 cells
(Figure 3A and 3B). The expressions of MCL-1, BCLXL and BCl-2 were significantly down-regulated in both
androgen-independent DU145 and C4-2B PCa cells. The
pro- apoptotic markers (BAX, BAK, and BID) and PARP
were shown to be significantly up-regulated in cells treated
with the combination of drugs after 48 h of treatment
compared to control. This observation showed that RES
enhances the docetaxel-mediated apoptosis in both cell

To validate the previous finding on apoptosis, we
further confirmed the expression of the pro-apoptotic and

Resveratrol-induced cell cycle distribution in C42B and DU145 cells

22μM+10nM (RES+DTX) for 48h showed the increased
percentage of cells in G2/M phase (69.7%) with
concomitant reduction of cells in S (8.5%) and G0/G1
(17.8%) phases (Figure 4B). These results suggest that
the combination of resveratrol and docetaxel causes the
highest number of cells arrested at G2/M phase compared
to resveratrol and docetaxel alone in both PCa cell lines.

In order to examine the distribution of cell cycle
progression, we confirmed the effect of RES in various
cell cycle phases using Flow cytometry. RES blocked the
cell cycle progression at G1/S or G2/M phase in a different
way in C4-2B and DU145 cells. We calculated the area
under the peaks to determine the phase within the cell
cycle, using Flow Jo software v10.2. The treatment of
C4-2B cells with RES (47μM) for 48h showed that the
distributions of cells in G0/G1, S and G2/M phases were
46.6%, 20.9 % and 38.6%. However, with DTX alone
(10 nM), the distributions were 21%, 10.5% and 42.8%,
respectively. The combined treatment with RES+DTX
(20μM+10nM) resulted in a marked increase in the
percentage of cells blocked at G2/M phase (58.2%) and
significantly reduced the percentage of cells at G0/G1
(19.1%) and S (5.6%) phases (Figure 4A). Similarly,
DU145 cells treated with 35μM (RES), 31nM (DTX),

Resveratrol modulates the expression of cell
cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1 and Cyclin
kinases in PCa cells
To investigate the effect of combination
(RES+DTX) on cell cycle progression, we performed
the western blot analysis and examined the synergistic
effect on G0/G1, S and G2/M phase within the cell cycle
in C4-2B and DU145 cells. The changes in the protein
expression of cell cycle regulators, such as p21WAF1/CIP1,
p27KIP1 (inhibitors of CDK family), p53, cyclin D1, CDK4
and cyclin E1, were validated, which are involved in G1/S

and after 48h cells were stained with propidium iodide for cell cycle analysis and detected by flow cytometry. Percentage of cells was
calculated by using FlowJo software, and a maximum number of cells was found to be arrested in the G2/M phase when treated with the
combination of RES+DTX compared to RES or DTX alone. B. DU145 cells were treated with RES, DTX and the combination (RES+DTX)

transition (Figure 5A). RES activated the p53 expression
and induced the increased expression of protein p21WAF1/
CIP1
and p27KIP1 in C4-2B cells, which are the inhibitors
of CDK/cyclin complex and mainly regulate the G1/S
transition. The enhanced expression of inhibitors p21WAF1/
CIP1
and p27KIP1 in cells treated with the combination of
drugs decreased the expression of PCNA (proliferating cell
nuclear antigen) to stop the further progression of DNA
replication and cell cycle. Similarly, RES in combination
with DTX inhibit the expression of cyclin D1, CDK4,
cyclin E1 and induce the hypo-phosphorylation of Rb
protein to inhibit the transition of cells towards G1/S
phase. Furthermore, the combination of drugs induced
a significant decrease in expression of cyclin B1 at 48h,
which are involved in the G2/M transition.

We further examined the antitumor effect of
RES in combination with DTX on cell cycle regulatory
protein in DU145 cells after 48h of treatment (Figure 5B).
Similar to C4-2B cells, RES enhanced the expression of
p53, which induces the increased expression of p21WAF1/
CIP1
and p27KIP1 in combination with DTX (22μM+10nM)
compared to DTX (31nM) and RES (35μM) only, which
further inhibit the CDK4/cyclin D1 complex by downregulation of the protein expression. Unlike C4-2B cells,
in DU145 no significant effect on expression of CDK1,
CDK2 and cyclin E1 was observed when treated with the
combination of drugs compared to RES alone. Moreover,
pRb was nonfunctional in the treatment groups, suggesting
that inhibition of cell growth may be independent of pRb,
and p53, which was also not expressed in DTX treated

Figure 5: Dose-response effects of RES, DTX, and combination of RES+DTX treatment for cell cycle regulation of
PCa cells. 3x106 cells were treated with the drugs in time and dosage- dependent manner for cell cycle regulation analysis. A. C4-2B
cells treated by the combination of drugs [RES+DTX (20μM, 10nM)] showed upregulation of the expression of p53, cell cycle inhibitors
(p21WAF1/CIP1and p27KIP1) and downregulation of p-RB, CDK/cyclin complexes compared to RES (47μM) or DTX (10nM) alone at 48 h
treatment. B. For DU145, p53 has less expression when treated with DTX (31nM) compared to RES (35μM) and combination (RES+DTX,
22μM+ 10nM). Other cell cycles regulatory protein cyclins (D1, E, and B1) CDKs, showed the effectiveness of RES+DTX in DU145.

DU145 cells. However, the pronounced reduction of antiproliferation marker PCNA was observed in cells treated
with both the drugs. The significant reduction of cyclin B1
in combination showed the highest number of cells arrested
at G2/M phases in DU145 cells. Together, these results of
C4-2B and DU145 cells suggest that the inhibition of the
cell cycle regulator by the synergistic effect of resveratroldocetaxel combination could be one of the possible
molecular events associated with the G2/M arrest, which
leads to inhibition and cell death.

significantly down regulated in the cells treated with
both RES and DTX. The down-regulation of PCNA and
up-regulation of PARP cleavage further substantiates
the synergistic effect of resveratrol and docetaxel on
promoting apoptosis in PCa. The synergistic effects of
RES and DTX on stimulating apoptosis in C4-2B and
DU145 were further justified by the quantitative RT-PCR
analysis.
The cell cycle progression is controlled by a
series of signaling cascades by which cell replicates its
DNA, divide and proliferate. Three checkpoints G1, S
and G2/M control the DNA replication and cell death
in cancer cells, which are controlled by p53, the master
regulator as well as other positive (CDKs and cyclins)
and negative (p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1) regulators of the cell
cycle (Figure 6). Up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1,
and down-regulation of cyclin D1/CDK complexes inhibit
the progression through the cell cycle from G1 to S phase
resulting in cell cycle arrest. Earlier studies demonstrated
that RES up-regulates the expression of p53 in both AD
and AI cell line, which induces the G1/S growth arrest
by the up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1, and downregulation of cyclin D1/CDK complexes [26–28]. In
order to evaluate the potential role of RES in enhancing
the effect of DTX in cell cycle arrest while used in
combination, the expressions of potential key regulator
proteins involved in cell cycle progression were tested
[23, 29]. Our data suggested that combined treatment of
the C4-2B cell line with RES and DTX indicates that the
up-regulation of p53 expression stimulates the expression
of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 and suppresses the expression
of cyclin D1/CDK4 complex thus blocks the progression
of cells from G1 to S phase. On the other hand, the E2F
is the family of transcription factors that are controlled
by the retinoblastoma protein pRb, and also regulates the
transition of cells from G1 to S phase. Previous studies
suggested that the hypo-phosphorylated pRB suppresses
the growth and finally blocks the progression of the cells
from G1 to S phase, but in the hyper-phosphorylation state,
it promotes the progression of malignant cell in the cell
cycle [30]. During G1 phase, cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs) phosphorylate pRb with the of releases of E2F
transcription factor for facilitating the genes for cellcycle progression. The Current study revealed that the
expression of the cyclin E1and CDK2 was significantly
inhibited in cells treated with a combination of drugs
compared to single drug alone. The down-regulation
of cyclin E1/CDK2 correlates with the blocking of
the cell at G1/S by inhibition of pRb. Similar studies
have reported that cyclin E expression was increased in
several malignancies such as leukemia, breast, prostate,
etc. [31–33] and down-regulation of cyclin E decreased
the proliferation rate of PCa cells. Further investigation
on cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, showed that the
combination of RES with DTX treatment promotes a
marked increase in the number of cells in mitosis phase,

DISCUSSION
Docetaxel is the most widely used chemotherapeutic
agent to target metastatic PCa, but prolonged use of
docetaxel results in drug resistance and toxicity in cancer
patients. Using the natural compound in the combination
therapy is a popular approach to combat the negative
aspects of using a chemotherapeutic agent alone. Previous
studies showed that resveratrol has anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic effects on prostate, breast, colon cancers
and other malignancies [5, 9, 22, 23]. The current study
demonstrated that the combined treatment of resveratrol
and docetaxel targeted the cell cycle regulatory molecules,
thus blocking proliferation and inducing apoptosis, which,
in turn, suppressed the growth and survival of PCa.
Our result corroborates the findings of other reports
based on RES-mediated apoptosis of PCa cells. Here,
we investigated the synergism between RES and DTX
in enhancing the activation of the p53 pathways, which
has been shown to play a central role in the induction
of apoptosis and disruption of DNA replication, thus
mediating the cell cycle arrest. Our finding showed that
combined drug treatment (RES+DTX) resulted in an
elevated level of p53 in C4-2B cells. Upon activation
of the p53 pathways, the pro-apoptotic proteins (BAX,
BID, and BAK) were up-regulated and anti-apoptotic
proteins (BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-XL) were downregulated in C4-2B. However, in DU145 cells, the effect
of combined treatment was not reflected in the p53
activation, although there was a significant increase in
pro-apoptotic protein BAX and profound decrease in antiapoptotic protein BCL-XL. The combination index (CI),
which is the standard measure of the combined effect of
the drugs (RES+DTX) as well supported the findings of
the significantly lower synergistic effect in DU145 cells.
This is also evident from the previous studies where
DU145 cell line was more sensitive to docetaxel alone but
has greater cell survival when two drugs were combined
[24]. Moreover, the increased level of PARP expression
further confirmed the effectiveness of combined drug
(RES+DTX) treatment in both cell lines in inducing
apoptosis, which was being supported by existing studies
[25]. The expression of the proliferating marker PCNA

replication and repair) for tumor development was also

and the effect was associated with the down-regulation
of cyclin B1 and CDK1 expression. Previous reports also
legitimize our findings that the arrest of G2/M checkpoint
transition is regulated by cyclin complexes and inhibitory
phosphorylation of cdc-family protein [34–36].
However, RES was shown to be more effective in
inducing apoptosis via upregulation of p53 compared
to DTX or DTX+RES treated group in DU145. The
synergistic effect of RES+DTX was also more profound
in C4-2B compared to DU145 cells. Previous studies
authenticated our findings, which showed that the
upregulation and phosphorylation of p53 are closely
associated with the docetaxel sensitivity in DU145.
Although RES enhanced the effect of DTX in C4-2B in

inducing apoptosis via upregulation of p53, the effect was
not prominent in DU145 due to its lesser sensitivity to
DTX. Additionally, the apoptosis pathway is independent
of p53, which is in accordance with the previous studies
[12].
The expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 was
upregulated in DU145 cells with combined drug treatment.
However, no significant effect on the expression of CDK1,
CDK2 and cyclin E1 was observed in cells treated with
RES+DTX compared to RES alone. The lack of pRB
expression in DU145 cells indicates that the arrest in cell
cycle checkpoint follows a different mechanism independent

Figure 6: Resveratrol inhibits PCa cell proliferation via modulating molecular pathways involved in cell cycle
progression and apoptosis. As illustrated in the figure, cell cycle has four distinct phases: G1 or gap 1(cells grow and prepare to

synthesize), S or synthesis (DNA Synthesizes), G2 or second gap (cells ready to divide) and M or mitosis phase (cell division occur). The
cell cycle progression is controlled by a series of signaling cascade by which cell replicates its DNA thus allowing cell division and growth.
The expression of the key regulatory gene p53 was elevated with the resveratrol treatment and also with the combination of RES+ DTX
at the 48h time point. P53 acts as a transcription factor by binding to specific DNA sequences and induce the increased expression of proapoptotic gene BAX and cell cycle inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1and p27KIP1. The up-regulation of BAX and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic
(BCL-2 family) gene causes the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol and activates caspase cascade family protein
cleaved PARP that induced the apoptosis. Moreover, the p21WAF1/CIP1and p27KIP1 binds to cyclin D, E /CDK complex and inhibits kinase
activity, and blocks the G1/S transition of the cells. The treatment with RES arrests the transition of cells at G2/M checkpoint by altering
the CDK1/cyclin B complex formation. Moreover, the elevated level of p21WAF1/CIP1and p27KIP1 inhibits cell cycle progression through the
interaction with PCNA and stops the further DNA replication.

G2/M checkpoint arrest in presence of 17allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) [37]. It is further
evident that p21 plays an important role in apoptosis by
inducing the pro-apoptotic protein (BAX) and inhibiting
anti-apoptotic protein (BCL-2) and is independent of p53
expression [18, 38, 39]. The present study also reveals
that the combined treatment of RES+DTX down-regulates
the expression of cyclin B1 and CDK1 in DU145 cells,
which established the findings from the cell cycle study
that promotes the accumulation of cells in G2/ M phase,
which is associated with increase or decrease in the cell
population in G0/G1 and S phases. Our findings in DU145
cells provide the relevance for using the combination of
drugs in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phases, which could be the
effective target for controlling the growth and proliferation
of PCa cells. Likewise, another study on DU145 cells
reveals that 88% cells were arrested at G2/M phase when
treated by the combination of silibin and doxorubicin for
48 h [36]. Overall our results suggest that the combined
treatment was more compelling in cell cycle arrest at G2/M
phase in both C4-2B cells and DU145 cells compared to the
resveratrol-treated group.
Finally, the present study demonstrates that RES
in combination with DTX deciphered apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest in PCa cell line C4-2B and DU145, although
the effect was less profound in DU145. Moreover, upregulation of apoptotic and down-regulation of the
anti-apoptotic marker at protein and mRNA expression
level further confirmed the effectiveness of resveratrol
while used in combination with docetaxel. The higher
expression of cell cycle inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1
and lower expression of cyclin-dependent kinases
CDK1, CDK4, cyclin E1 and cyclin B1 in PCa cells also
proves the combinatorial effect of RES and DTX, which
stop the transition of cells from G1/S and G2/M phase.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the therapeutic
efficacy of resveratrol in combination with low dosages of
docetaxel could lead to improving the clinical outcomes of
prostate cancer treatment in clinical setting.

bromide) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Growing cells were
trypsinized and collected using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA
(Fisher scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and seeded in 96well plates at a cell density of 10,000 cells /well. Cells
were treated with docetaxel (5, 10, 50 nM), resveratrol
(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 μM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and
combination of drugs each well per concentration,
and incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h at 37°C and 5% CO2
incubator. MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and
incubated for 2-3 h, the purple formazan crystal was
dissolved in 100μL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma),
and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a
spectrophotometer (Spectramax M5, Molecular devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). The IC50 (half maximum inhibitory
concentration) value was calculated for both cell lines.
After determining the IC50 values for RES and DTX
for each C4-2B and DU145 cell line, a combination of
RES+DTX were evaluated for synergy, additives, and
antagonism, using combination index (CI) method
introduced by Chou [40]. The combination index (CI)
method was based on the non-exclusive model and
following equation was used for the calculation: CI= RES/
(RES)x + DTX/(DTX)x + (RES)(DTX)/(RES)x(DTX)x . To
determine the effect of the drug combination, CI values
were tested for synergy (CI<0.9), additive (0.9<CI<1.1)
and antagonism (CI>1.1) respectively. The combination
index experiment was repeated in triplicate at each
drug concentration level, and the relative growth rates
calculated in comparison with PCa cells in the absence of
any cytotoxic drugs.

Immunofluorescence assay
Twenty-thousand (20,000) cells were seeded in
per well of a 12 well plate overnight and then treated
with known concentration of RES, DTX and RES+DTX
combination for 48h at 37°C and 5% CO2 incubator. After
treatment cells were washed with PBS and incubated with
2drops/ml of cell viability imaging kit (Thermo Scientific,
USA) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Images were captured by a
fluorescent microscope with DAPI and FITC/GFP filter
using EVOS FL microscope (Thermo Scientific, USA).

Immunoblots analysis was conducted on total
untreated cell lysates or lysates of DU145 and C4-2B
cell lines treated with known concentration of drugs
(resveratrol, docetaxel, and combination of resveratrol and
docetaxel) for 48h, Protein concentrations of the cell lysates
were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay
kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The equal amounts
(30 μg) of protein from the cell lysates were denatured
by boiling in Laemmli buffer for 5 minutes, resolved by
4-12% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes using iBlot dry blotting system
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The membranes were
blocked in TBS (20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl)
(Fisher scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) containing 0.1% Tween
20 and 5% non-fat dry milk (Biorad, USA) for one hour at
room temperature. Primary antibodies against p53, PCNA,
pro-apoptotic (BAX, BAK, BID), anti-apoptotic (BCL-2,
BCL-Xl, MCL-1), cleaved PARP, and cell cycle regulators

cyclin E, CDK1, CDK2, and CDK4) purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (MA, USA) and were added to the
membranes at concentration (1:500 to 1:1000 dilution) and
incubated overnight at 4°C in 5% non-fat milk containing
TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline-Tween 20). Membranes were
then washed and corresponding horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for one
hour followed by extra washes. Immunoreactive proteins
were visualized on Image Quant LAS4000 (GE HealthcareBiosciences, Pittsburgh, PA) using chemiluminescent
detection reagent (Thermo fisher Scientific, Rockford,
IL). The membranes were stripped, blocked in 5% nonfat milk for one hour, and reprobed with glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Cell signaling,
USA) to ensure equal loading. The band intensities were
quantified using the Image-J software (NIH).

Statistical analysis
