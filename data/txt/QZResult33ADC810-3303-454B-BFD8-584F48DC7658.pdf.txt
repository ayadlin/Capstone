SIRT1 and AMPK Mediate Hypoxia-Induced Resistance of
Non–Small Cell Lung Cancers to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin
Dong Hoon Shin, Yong-Joon Choi, and Jong-Wan Park

Abstract
SIRT1 is an NADþ-dependent protein deacetylase induced by metabolic stresses, such as nutrition or oxygen
deprivation. Although SIRT1 contributes to aging and metabolic disorders, its role in cancer progression and
therapeutic responses remains controversial. Because hypoxia occurs widely in solid tumors, where it provokes
drug resistance, we investigated the involvement of SIRT1 in hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. SIRT1 was
downregulated in a panel of non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells exposed to hypoxia for 48 hours. The
master metabolic kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was inactivated under the same conditions, likely
due to attenuation of the SIRT1/LKB1-mediated AMPK activation process. Notably, hypoxic inactivation of this
SIRT1–AMPK pathway led to cisplatin and doxorubicin resistance. Mechanistic investigations suggested that this
pathway supported the cytotoxic response to cisplatin and doxorubicin by licensing an apoptotic process
controlled by mitochondria. We conﬁrmed the involvement of this pathway in a mouse xenograft model of human
NSCLC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a SIRT1 activator SRT1720 augmented the antitumor effects of
cisplatin, and these effects could be blocked by administration of an AMPK inhibitor compound C. Taken
together, our results offer preclinical proof-of-concept to target the SIRT1–AMPK pathway as a strategy to
overcome hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in NSCLC. Cancer Res; 74(1); 298–308. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Solid tumors almost always contain hypoxic areas when they
are radiologically detected. In tumors, oxygen consumption is
increased by proliferating cancer cells and inﬁltrating immune
cells, and also oxygen delivery is impaired due to the abnormal
vasculature network and the high interstitial pressure (1, 2).
When cancer cells are challenged intermittently or constantly
by hypoxic stress, they set their metabolism to an energysaving mode and refrain from proliferating. Many clinical and
experimental studies have demonstrated that cancer cells
exposed to hypoxia acquire resistance to anticancer drugs.
Basically, drugs are poorly delivered to hypoxic areas with
circulation disturbance, and cancer cells are better able to
survive after adapting to the hypoxic insult (3). Many molecules
have been suggested to be responsible for the hypoxia-induced
drug resistance (4). However, the mechanisms underlying
chemoresistance are quite different according to cancer contexts and drugs, and complicated even in a cell-line treated
with single drug.

Sirtuins belong to the class III histone deacetylase (HDAC)
family that includes seven isoforms (SIRT1-7) in mammalian
cells. They require NADþ as a substrate to deacetylate the
lysine residues in histones and non-histone proteins (5, 6).
SIRT1 is considered as the prototype of mammalian sirtuins
because its structure is most similar to that of the yeast Sir2.
SIRT1, which is mainly located in the nucleus, regulates gene
expressions by changing the chromatin structures and by
modulating the activities of transcription factors (7, 8). As its
activity depends on the ratio of NADþ/NADH, SIRT1 acts as a
redox sensor to cope with metabolic imbalance under nutrition- or oxygen-deﬁcient conditions (9). As a whole, SIRT1
helps cells utilize glucose and survive under harmful conditions. In addition, SIRT1 is critical in diverse biologic processes,
such as cell division, differentiation, senescence, and tumorigenesis (10, 11).
Cumulative evidence has supported the involvement of
SIRT1 in cancer progression. SIRT1 exerts its tumor suppressive activity by inhibiting oxidative stress, inﬂammation, proliferation, and angiogenesis, by counteracting genotoxic stress,
and by inducing apoptosis and autophagy (12–15). In contrast,
SIRT1 also provides cancer cells with survival and expansion
advantages, which are achieved through p53 inactivation, Myc
activation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (16–18).
Besides these Janus-faced roles in cancer promotion, SIRT1
might determine tumor responses to anticancer drugs.
Although SIRT1 has not been intensively explored in terms of
cancer chemotherapy, previous studies have supported the
notion that SIRT1 plays some positive roles in tumor acquisition of chemoresistance (19). Whether SIRT1 participates in
the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance is unclear.

Roles of SIRT1 and AMPK in Hypoxia-Induced Drug Resistance

During hypoxia, the cellular ratio of NADþ/NADH declines
because the dehydrogenation of NADH to NADþ in the mitochondrion is impaired, which results in decreased functionality of SIRT1 (20). In addition, the increased NADH triggers the
repressor C-terminal-Binding Protein-1 (CtBP) to associate with
Hypermethylated In Cancer 1 (HIC1) on the SIRT1 promoter,
reducing the expression of SIRT1 (21). Taken together, SIRT1
action is generally regarded to be inhibited under hypoxia.
On the basis of the previous concept about the SIRT1mediated chemoresistance, theoretically, SIRT1 inhibition
under hypoxia may sensitize cancer cells to anticancer drugs.
However, in reality, chemoresistance is induced under hypoxia.
To clarify this dichotomy, the present study was designed and
performed. In particular, we focused on the role of SIRT1 in the
hypoxia-induced resistance against cisplatin or doxorubicin in
non–small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies
SRT1720, EX527, A769662, cisplatin, and doxorubicin were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals and compound C from EMD
Millipore. Antibodies against SIRT1, PGC-1a, cytochrome c,
Lamin B, Caspase-9, PARP, and b-actin were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies against AMPKa, pAMPKa,
mTOR, pmTOR, Caspase-3, and Beclin-1 from Cell Signaling
Technology; antibodies against Bcl-2 family (Bad, Bak, Bid, Bax,
Bim, Bcl-x, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bag-1) from Abcam. Anti-HIF-1a
antiserum was raised in rabbits, as previously described (22).
Cell culture and hypoxic incubation
NSCLC (H1299 and A549), ﬁbrosarcoma (HT1080), gastric
cancer (MKN28), ovarian cancer (SKOV3), breast cancer
(MDAMB-231), brain cancer (SHSY5Y and SKNMC), hepatoma
(Hep3B and HepG2), renal cancer (786O and RCC4), cervical
cancer (HeLa and SiHa), colon cancer (HT29, HCT116 and CT26),
and head and neck cancer (YD10B) cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection; other NSCLC cell lines
(HCC15, HCC366, and HCC827) from Korea Cell Line Bank. The
cell lines were passaged for less than 6 months after being authenticated by DNA ﬁngerprinting, which was performed using the
AmplFLSTR Identiﬁler PCR Ampliﬁcation Kit by Korean Cell
Line Bank. The cells were cultured in minimum essential medium, Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium, or RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Cells were incubated in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere at 37 C at 20% O2/5% CO2 for normoxic
condition or at 1% O2/5% CO2 for hypoxic condition.
Cell viability assay
After cells (2  103) were cultured in 96-well plates under
normoxia or hypoxia for 2 days, cell viability was measured
using MTT dye. Quadruplicate wells were used for each analysis and at least three independent experiments were done.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 1%
NP40, 5 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors. After being boiled in a denaturing SDS sample buffer,

www.aacrjournals.org

samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE and then transferred
onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 C with a primary antibody, incubated for 1 hour with a HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody, and visualized using the ECL Plus Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with 5 mL of anti-LKB1 or anti-AMPK antiserum, or
preimmune serum at 4 C for 2 hours, and immune complexes
were further incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (GE
Healthcare) at 4 C for 4 hours. Immunocomplexes were eluted
by 10-minute boiling in a denaturing SDS sample buffer and
subjected to immunoblotting with anti-SIRT1, anti-LKB1, or
anti-acetyl-lysine antibody.
Analysis of mitochondrial morphology
Cells were rinsed with 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer and ﬁxed
in 3.5% glutaraldehyde (pH 7.4) for 24 hours at 4 C. After being
washed in the cacodylate buffer containing 5% sucrose, cells
were post-ﬁxed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hour at 4 C. Cells
were gradually dehydrated in ethanol (50% to 100%) and
inﬁltrated with Spurr's resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences)
over 2 hours. The resin was replaced with fresh Spurr's resin
poured in inverted BEEM embedding capsules (Ted Pella, Inc.)
and allowed to be polymerized at 60 C for 36 hours. Beam
capsules were snapped off and attached cells were analyzed by
electron microscopy. Parameters of mitochondrial morphology (area and perimeter) were quantiﬁed using the ImageJ
program (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Tumor xenograft
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with a
protocol approved by the Seoul National University Animal
Care and Usage Committee (Approval number, SNU-130104).
Nude mice (BALB/cAnNCrj-nu/nu) from Charles River
Japan Inc. (Shin-Yokohama) were injected at a dorsal ﬂank
site with 1  106 cells in saline. Tumor volume was measured
with calipers (volume ¼ a  b2  0.52, where a is the widest
width and b is the perpendicular width) once every 3 days.
When tumors reached a volume of 80–100 mm3 (termed day
0 in this study), mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
3 times a week with DMSO, cisplatin, SRT1720, or compound
C. On day 21, mice were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation. Each
tumor was cut into two parts, which were ﬁxed with 4%
formalin or frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Statistical analysis
Each result is expressed as the mean and SE or SD, which
was calculated using Microsoft Excel 2010. We used unpaired,
two-sided Student t test for all tests and statistical difference
was considered signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

increased under hypoxia in H1299, A549, Hep3B, and HT1080,
but did not in HCT116 and MCF7 (Fig. 1A). We checked SIRT1
in 21 different cancer cell lines and also hypoxia inducible factor
1a (HIF-1a) to verify cellular responses to hypoxia. SIRT1
expression in hypoxia was variable in cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Notably, ﬁve NSCLC lines (H1299, A549, HCC15, HCC366,
and HCC827) displayed hypoxic repression of SIRT1 at the
mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1B and C). Given that HIFs are
crucial in hypoxia-induced gene regulation, we examined the
regulation of SIRT1 expression by HIF-1a or HIF-2a. SIRT1
expression under either normoxia or hypoxia was not affected by
overexpression or silencing of HIF-1a and HIF-2a (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that SIRT1 is expressed independently of

HIFs. We next examined the role of SIRT1 in chemoresistance by
manipulating SIRT1 expression. Under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions, the IC50 values for cisplatin and doxorubicin in
H1299 and A549 cells were signiﬁcantly reduced by SIRT1 expression, whereas these were raised by SIRT1 knockdown (Fig. 1D
and Supplementary Fig. S3A). These results indicate that SIRT1
overexpression sensitizes NSCLC cells to the anticancer drugs
whereas its knockdown confers drug resistance. Given that the
effects of SIRT1 were shown in normoxic and hypoxic conditions,
SIRT1 may sensitize cancer cells to the drugs regardless of the
oxygen tension. Moreover, even in HCT116 cells that did not
show drug resistance and SIRT1 downregulation during hypoxia
(Fig. 1B), the IC50 values for both drugs were decreased or

Roles of SIRT1 and AMPK in Hypoxia-Induced Drug Resistance

increased by SIRT1 expression or knockdown, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The chemosensitization by SIRT1 may not
be a hypoxia-speciﬁc event. To conﬁrm the role of SIRT1 in response to chemotherapy, we examined the effects of a SIRT1
activator, SRT1720, and a SIRT1 inhibitor, EX527, on cisplatin- or
doxorubicin-induced cell death. Hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in both cell lines was attenuated by SRT1720, but was
augmented by EX527 (Supplementary Fig. S4). To test whether
SIRT1 determines the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and doxorubicin in naturally occurring hypoxia, a colony formation assay
was carried out because typically the core part of a colony is
hypoxic due to limited oxygen diffusion (23). As was expected,
colony numbers substantially decreased in the presence of
cisplatin or doxorubicin. The anticancer effects were potentiated
by SRT1720, but diminished by EX527 (Fig. 1E). All of these
results suggest that the SIRT1 downregulation during hypoxia

induces tumor resistances against cisplatin and doxorubicin
and that SIRT1 restoration sensitizes hypoxic NSCLC cells to
the drugs.
AMPK is inactivated in NSCLC cells during hypoxia,
leading to tumor resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin
SIRT1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) act as
metabolic sensors to revise the energy metabolisms according
to nutritional states. They play this role independently, or do so
cooperatively, by regulating each other and by sharing common target molecules (24, 25). Therefore, we measured phospho-Thr172 AMPKa (an active, catalytic subunit of the AMPK
complex) levels in NSCLC cells subjected to hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S1). As was shown for SIRT1, phosphorylated
AMPKa (pAMPKa) was diminished under hypoxia in NSCLC
cells (Fig. 2A). The pAMPKa level correlated well (r2 ¼ 0.94)

with SIRT1 level in NSCLC cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). This
result encouraged us to check the dependence of AMPKa
phosphorylation on SIRT1. AMPKa phosphorylation was regulated SIRT1 dependently under both normoxic and hypoxic
conditions (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the mTOR phosphorylation at
Ser2448 was negatively regulated by SIRT1, suggesting that the
SIRT1-activated AMPK inhibits mTOR phosphorylation. An in
vitro assay of AMPK activity also demonstrated that SIRT1
activates AMPK (Fig. 2C). Seeking to determine how SIRT1
activates AMPK, we were prompted by a previous report (26) to
check the possibility that SIRT1 deacetylates and activates
LKB1, which functions to activate AMPK. When SIRT1 was
downregulated during hypoxia or knocked-down using siRNA,
the acetylated form of LKB1 noticeably increased, but was

reduced in hypoxia by SIRT1 expression (Fig. 2D), suggesting
that SIRT1 activates AMPK in NSCLC cells by deacetylating
LKB1. Moreover, AMPKa sensitized NSCLC cells to cisplatin
(Fig. 2E) and doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
The SIRT1–AMPKa pathway underlies hypoxia-induced
chemoresistance in NSCLC cells
To conﬁrm that the hypoxic inactivation of the SIRT1–
AMPK pathway confers drug resistance to NSCLC cells, NSCLC
cells were treated with SIRT1 and AMPK modulators in
combination (Fig. 3A). A SIRT1 inhibitor (EX527) induced drug
resistances under normoxia, which was reversed by an AMPK
activator (A769662). In contrast, a SIRT1 activator (SRT1720)
sensitized cancer cells to cisplatin and doxorubicin under

Roles of SIRT1 and AMPK in Hypoxia-Induced Drug Resistance

hypoxia, which was reversed by an AMPK inhibitor (compound
C). Likewise, another SIRT1 activator, resveratrol augmented
the anticancer actions of both drugs in H1299 and A549 cells
under hypoxia, but such effects of resveratrol were abolished by
compound C (Supplementary Fig. S6). To rule out off-target
effects of small molecules, we checked cell viabilities using the
plasmids and siRNAs for SIRT1 and AMPKa (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3A, SIRT1 knockdown
signiﬁcantly induced resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin
under normoxia, and this effect was abolished by AMPKa
overexpression. Under hypoxia, SIRT1 overexpression augmented the anticancer effects of cisplatin and doxorubicin,
but the SIRT1 effects were attenuated by AMPKa knockdown.
Moreover, the EX527-induced chemoresistance in normoxia
was overcome by AMPKa expression, whereas the SRT1720induced chemosensitization in hypoxia was attenuated by
AMPKa knockdown (Fig. 3C). To determine whether the SIRT1
deacetylase function determines tumor responses to drugs, a
deacetylase-defective, dominant-negative mutant of SIRT1
(H363Y) was expressed (27). SIRT1_H363Y induced cisplatin
and doxorubicin resistance under normoxia, which was
reversed by AMPKa expression (Fig. 3D). These results suggest
that the SIRT1–AMPK pathway determines the sensitivities of
NSCLC cells to cisplatin and doxorubicin.
SIRT1–AMPK inactivation under hypoxia protects tumor
cells from apoptosis in the presence of cisplatin or
doxorubicin
To understand how the SIRT1–AMPK pathway determines
tumor responses to cisplatin and doxorubicin, various apo-

ptotic markers in cisplatin- or doxorubicin-treated NSCLC
cells were measured. The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells was reduced by SIRT1 knockdown, but was increased
by AMPKa expression. The TUNEL-positive cell population
was signiﬁcantly reduced under hypoxia. This effect of hypoxia
was attenuated by SIRT1 expression, which was reversed by
AMPKa knockdown (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S7A).
Likely, caspase-9 in NSCLC cells treated with the drugs was
activated in a SIRT1- and AMPK-dependent manner (Fig. 4B
and Supplementary Fig. S7B). As the release of mitochondrial
cytochrome c (Cyt-c) is the initial event of apoptosis, we
evaluated the Cyt-c release by costaining Cyt-c (green) with
Mitotracker (red; Supplementary Fig. S8). Normally, Cyt-c
colocalizes with Mitotracker, which produces yellow ﬂuorescence due to a green–red overlap. However, the yellow areas
under normoxia were reduced in cancer cells treated with the
drugs, but increased with siSIRT1, which was reversed by
AMPKa expression. Under hypoxia, however, Cyt-c still localized within mitochondria even in the presence of the drugs,
but it was dispersed by SIRT1 expression, which was reversed
by AMPKa knockdown. The localization of Cyt-c was also
rechecked in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions by
Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S9). To conﬁrm the
involvement of SIRT1 in drug-induced apoptosis, we measured
the cleaved forms of caspase-3 and PARP. Caspase-3 and PARP
were cleaved under normoxia in the presence of cisplatin
or doxorubicin. The drug-induced cleavages were attenuated
under hypoxia, which was reversed by SIRT1 expression (Fig.
4C). Moreover, the hypoxia-induced resistance to cisplatin was

attenuated by SIRT1 expression, which was reversed by a
caspase inhibitor (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the
hypoxic inactivation of the SIRT1–AMPK pathway renders
cancer cells resistant to caspase-mediated apoptosis induced
by anticancer drugs.
Hypoxic inactivation of the SIRT1–AMPK pathway
reduces apoptosis by inhibiting mitochondrial activity
Mitochondria play a central role in apoptotic cell death
under genotoxic stress induced by anticancer agents (28, 29).

As both SIRT1 and AMPK promote mitochondrial biogenesis (25), we hypothesized that they determine tumor
sensitivities to cisplatin and doxorubicin by ensuring mitochondrial biogenesis. To examine mitochondrial structure,
transmission electron microscopy was used to examine
NSCLC cells in normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 5A, left).
Mitochondrial parameters like area, number, and perimeter
were measured using the ImageJ program (Fig. 5A, right).
Mitochondria decreased in number and size during hypoxia.
These changes were prevented by SIRT1 restoration, which

Roles of SIRT1 and AMPK in Hypoxia-Induced Drug Resistance

was attenuated by AMPKa knockdown. In addition, the mitochondrial parameters were reduced under normoxia by SIRT1
knockdown, which was reversed by AMPKa expression. To
evaluate mitochondrial function, ATP levels were measured in
NSCLC cells (Fig. 5B). The normoxic ATP levels were reduced
by SIRT1 knockdown, which was recovered by AMPKa expression. ATP levels decreased during hypoxia were recovered by
SIRT1 expression, which was attenuated by AMPKa knockdown. These results suggest that the inactivation of the SIRT1–
AMPK pathway leads to mitochondrial suppression under
hypoxia. These ﬁndings strongly indicate that the hypoxic
inactivation of the SIRT1–AMPK pathway blocks mitochondriogenic apoptosis through mitochondrial suppression and
subsequently desensitizes cancer cells to anticancer drugs.

The anticancer effect of cisplatin is augmented in H1299
tumors by activation of the SIRT1–AMPK pathway
We examined whether the anticancer effect of cisplatin is
modulated through the SIRT1–AMPK pathway in H1299 xenografted tumors. Cisplatin reduced tumor volume and weight by
23% and 50%, respectively, 21 days after the ﬁrst drug injection.
Cisplatin in combination with SRT1720 retarded tumor growth
more efﬁciently, but the combination effect was abolished by
an additional treatment with compound C (Fig. 6A and B).
Body weights of mice on day 21 were not signiﬁcantly different
among the six experimental groups (Fig. 6C). Representative
photographs of excised tumors are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S10. To evaluate AMPK activity and apoptosis in xenografts, Western blotting of tumor tissue homogenates was

carried out. AMPKa in grafted tumors was activated by
SRT1720 injection but was inactivated by compound C injection. The combined treatment with SRT1720 and cisplatin
increased the levels of cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3. However, the addition of compound C attenuated the combination
effect (Supplementary Figs. S11A and S11B). The tumor levels
of activated AMPKa and caspases were quantiﬁed using the
ImageJ program and compared among the groups (Fig. 6D).
Apoptotic death of cancer cells in H1299 xenografts was
examined using TUNEL staining. SRT1720 sensitized tumors
to cisplatin but compound C desensitized tumors (Supplementary Fig. S11C). The in vivo results supported the notion
that the SIRT1–AMPK pathway can be a target for sensitizing
NSCLC cells to cisplatin.

Discussion
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide in terms
of incidence and mortality, and NSCLC constitutes approximately 80% of all primary lung cancers (30, 31). Chemotherapy
for NSCLC is based on the combined treatment of cisplatin and
another anticancer drug, including gemcitabine, irinotecan,
taxanes, and vinorelbine (32). Although these combination
regimens have produced better therapeutic results than cisplatin alone, the best regimens can only give an overall
response rate of less than 50% (33). Strategies to further
improve the survival of patients with NSCLC involve discovery
or development of more effective drugs, or the sensitization of
NSCLC cells to preexisting drugs. For the latter strategy, the
mechanisms underlying chemoresistance need to be clearly
understood. Yet, this goal is difﬁcult to achieve because
resistance is multifactorial, involving pharmacokinetic resistance, cellular resistance, and the microenvironment. The
present study focused on the mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced chemoresistance, and implicated hypoxic repression of SIRT1 in the resistance of NSCLC cells to cisplatin and
doxorubicin.
In the present study, we ﬁrst investigated whether SIRT1
participates in the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in
NSCLC cells. As SIRT1 was downregulated during hypoxia, we
tested the possibility that the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance could be attributed to SIRT1 repression. SIRT1 was
required for the cytotoxic actions of cisplatin and doxorubicin,
which was shown in the experiments controlling SIRT1 expression and activity. SIRT1 activated AMPK by deacetylating and
activating the AMPK activator LKB1. The involvement of the
SIRT1–AMPK pathway in the tumor-killing actions of cisplatin
and doxorubicin was also demonstrated by controlling the
expressions and activities of AMPKa and SIRT1. Furthermore,
the SIRT1–AMPK pathway promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and by doing so ensured mitochondriogenic apoptosis in
the presence of cisplatin or doxorubicin. Under hypoxia,
however, the drug-mediated apoptosis was attenuated due to
mitochondrial suppression induced by the SIRT1–AMPK inactivation. The graphical summary of this mechanism is presented in Fig. 7.
Although the relation between SIRT1 and cancer has been
extensively investigated in the past decade, the roles of SIRT1

in tumorigenesis and tumor development are still controversial. The oncogenic role of SIRT1 has been supported by clinical
and pharmacologic reports showing that SIRT1 is highly
expressed in some human cancers and that tumor growth can
be retarded by SIRT1 inhibition (34). For example, Li and
colleagues found that SIRT1 was highly expressed in stem cells
of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; ref. 35). They also
demonstrated that SIRT1 inhibition could suppress the growth
of CML both in vitro and in vivo due to p53 activation (35). In
contrast, many studies using mice with genetically modiﬁed
SIRT1 levels have consistently demonstrated that SIRT1 serves
as a tumor suppressor (36). Because it targets a variety of key
factors determining cell fate, SIRT1 could act as a tumor
suppressor or promoter depending on cell context. In the
present study, we treated H1299 tumor-bearing mice with
SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator) for 3 weeks, but observed no
signiﬁcant change in tumor growth (Fig. 6A). This result
suggests that SIRT1 does not play a critical role in H1299
tumor growth. Nonetheless, SIRT1 could be a promising target
for cancer therapy because it participates in the apoptotic
process induced by anticancer drugs.
SIRT1 regulation under hypoxia is dependent on the cell
context. As shown in Fig. 1B, the hypoxic repression of SIRT1
was not observed in about 50% of tested cell lines. In particular,
RCC4, MKN28, and HeLa cells induce SIRT1 expression during
hypoxia. Indeed, the hypoxic regulation of SIRT1 expression
remains as a conﬂicting phenomenon. Chen and colleagues

Roles of SIRT1 and AMPK in Hypoxia-Induced Drug Resistance

demonstrated that SIRT1 in Hep3B and HT1080 cell-lines
is induced under hypoxia at the transcriptional level by both
HIF-1a and HIF-2a (37). In contrast, Zhang and colleagues
showed that the SIRT1 transcription in ﬁbroblasts is noticeably repressed under hypoxia in a CtBP-dependent fashion
(21). Presently, SIRT1 was constantly downregulated in the
tested NSCLC cell lines. To rule out the possible involvement
of HIF-1a/2a in SIRT1 regulation, we overexpressed or
knocked-down both HIFs in NSCLC cells, but found no differences in SIRT1 levels under either normoxia or hypoxia. More
deﬁned experiments should be done to elucidate why SIRT1
under hypoxic conditions is differentially regulated among cell
lines.
AMPK is activated in response to poor energy states, such
as nutrient deﬁciency, severe exercise, and other cellular
stresses, due to increased levels of AMP, a product of ATP
breakdown. AMP binds to the g-subunit of the AMPK
complex, which allosterically promotes the LKB1-mediated
phosphorylation and activation of the catalytic a-subunit
(26). AMPK restores energy homeostasis by facilitating the
catabolic processes of glucose and fatty acid. Many recent
studies have supported the existence of bidirectional crosstalk between AMPK and SIRT1. In terms of the AMPK
regulation of SIRT1, Canto and colleagues demonstrated
that AMPK stimulates SIRT1 activity in myoblasts by
increasing the ratio of NADþ/NADH (38). In contrast, Lan
and colleagues demonstrated that SIRT1 activates AMPK
signaling in human embryonic kidney cells by deacetylating
LKB1 at Lys48 (39). Brieﬂy, after being deacetylated by
SIRT1, LKB1 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it forms an active complex with STE20-related
adaptor protein (STRAD) and mouse embryo scaffold protein (MO25), and then activates the a-subunit of AMPK. Of
the two regulatory routes, the SIRT1–AMPK pathway might
be involved in NSCLC cell responses to cisplatin and doxorubicin because the SIRT1 action on drug resistance could
be reversed by inhibiting AMPK. Moreover, the acetylated
(inactive) LKB1 level increased during hypoxia due to SIRT1
suppression. However, we did not check whether the AMPKto-SIRT1 pathway determines anticancer effects.
The metabolic sensors SIRT1 and AMPK have been reported
to promote mitochondrial biogenesis through the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1a (PGC1a) signaling pathway. PGC-1a binds and activates nuclear
respiratory factor 1 and 2, mitochondrial transcription factor
A, and estrogen-related receptor gamma transcription factors
that express the nuclear genes essential for mitochondrial
replication and respiratory function (40). Under energy-deﬁcient conditions, the intracellular levels of AMP and NADþ
increase, leading to activation of both AMPK and SIRT1. Then,

PGC-1a is phosphorylated and deacetylated cooperatively by
the two enzymes, and activates the genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis in the nucleus (38). Hypoxia may drive cell
metabolism toward the adaptation to energy deprivation
because the energy level also drops during hypoxia. However,
mitochondrial biogenesis should be blocked during hypoxia
because the mitochondria become useless for ATP generation
due to lack of oxygen and instead produce free electron-driven
toxic metabolites like reactive oxygen species. Fig. 7 depicts a
proposed mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced mitochondrial suppression.
On the basis of the present results, we can suggest a new
potential strategy for overcoming the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in NSCLC. The combination of a SIRT1 activator or/and an AMPK activator with conventional anticancer drugs like cisplatin and doxorubicin. Considering that
drug-induced apoptosis is triggered in hypoxia by activating
the SIRT1–AMPK pathway, this strategy may be useful for
augmenting the anticancer effects of molecularly targeted
drugs. In this case, however, the outcome of the SIRT1–
AMPK activation might depend on the target signaling of the
drugs because SIRT1 and AMPK can cross-talk with multiple
signaling pathways that confer a survival beneﬁt on the cells.
The advantages and disadvantages of SIRT1–AMPK activation in cancer therapy should be carefully evaluated before
its clinical application.
