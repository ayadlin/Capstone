ABSTRACT
The anticancer drug 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) inhibits de novo purine synthesis
and acts as an antiproliferative agent by interfering with protein, DNA and RNA
synthesis and promoting apoptosis. Metabolic reprogramming is crucial for tumor
progression to foster cancer cells growth and proliferation, and is regulated by
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as
well as the oncogenes Myc and hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). We hypothesized
that 6-MP impacts metabolic remodeling through its action on nucleotide synthesis.
The aim of our study is to provide a comprehensive characterization of the metabolic
changes induced by 6-MP in leukemic T cells. Our results indicate that exposition to
6-MP rapidly reduces intracellular ATP concentration, leading to the activation of
AMPK. In turn, mTOR, an AMPK target, was inhibited, and the expression of HIF-1α and
Myc was reduced upon 6-MP incubation. As a consequence of these inhibitions, glucose
and glutamine fluxes were strongly decreased. Notably, no difference was observed
on glucose uptake upon exposition to 6-MP. In conclusion, our findings provide new
insights into how 6-MP profoundly impacts cellular energetic metabolism by reducing
ATP production and decreasing glycolytic and glutaminolytic fluxes, and how 6-MP
modifies human leukemic T cells metabolism with potential antiproliferative effects.

INTRODUCTION

approved to prevent rejection of solid organ transplants
and is an effective therapy to maintain remission of
autoimmune diseases [2, 3, 5, 10]. Specifically, 6-MP is
widely prescribed to block tumor growth of childhood
acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) [1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10–15].
Numerous mechanisms are involved in the
antiproliferative effects of 6-MP, which include its
incorporation into nucleic acids chains (leading to
DNA damage and apoptosis) and its ability to inhibit
de novo purine synthesis [1–6, 10]—which is crucial for
lymphocyte proliferation because these cells rely more on
de novo pathway than on the salvage pathway [5, 16, 17].
6-MP can also inhibit de novo biosynthesis of ATP and
GTP [18]. In addition, recent evidence indicates that
6-MP inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) /

The thiopurine drugs, including azathioprine,
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG),
are purinergic antimetabolite agents with profound
antiproliferative effects [1–6]. Azathioprine is converted
into 6-MP, whose enzymatically driven metabolites
6-thioguanine nucleotides and 6-methylmercaptopurine
interfere with RNA, DNA and protein synthesis as well
as promote apoptosis of proliferating T cells [1–3, 6–9].
Although the precise molecular mechanism involved in
the inhibition of T cells still remain unclear, thiopurines
are prescribed for the treatment of numerous diseases
involving T cells activation and proliferation [1–6].

[8], suggesting that these drugs might interfere with
metabolic checkpoints and impact metabolic reprogramming
in normal T cells and cancer [19]. In line with its possible
role in cell metabolic reprogramming, 6-MP regulates
the activity of members of the orphan nuclear receptor
NR4A family, which acts as key transcriptional regulators
of glucose and lipid metabolism [20]. In addition, 6-MP
modifies the transcriptional activity of hypoxia inducible
factor 1α (HIF-1α) [21] and inhibits enzymes implicated
in glycolysis, such as phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK2) and
hexokinase (HK) [22].
Metabolic reprogramming promotes glycolysis,
glutaminolysis, and biosynthesis of nucleotides and lipids
to support cell growth and proliferation [19, 23], and, as
such, is a major feature of cancer cells. To produce ATP,
proliferating cells shift glucose metabolism from oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis [24–27],
a process far less efficient than OXPHOS [19, 23–25, 
27, 28] but one that generates biosynthetic precursors
through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) [19, 23, 26]
and facilitates the production of a pool of purine and
pyrimidine nucleotides to support cancer cell growth and
proliferation [19, 23]. Critical regulators of metabolic
reprogramming in proliferating cells, referred to as
metabolic checkpoints, include mTOR, AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) and the oncogenes Myc and HIF1α [19, 23].
We conducted the present study to test whether 6-MP
impacts T cell metabolism. We performed a comprehensive
analysis of the metabolic changes promoted by 6-MP
in proliferating T cells, and we demonstrated that 6-MP
inhibits ATP synthesis and promotes global shutdown of
glucose metabolism, leading to an energetic distress.

incubation, the cytosolic form of LC3 (LC3-I) is converted
into the LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate
(LC3-II), which is recruited to autophagosomal membranes.
In addition to promoting cell death, 6-MP slightly reduced
cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner based on
the measurement of the Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl
ester (CFSE) dilution (Figure 1C) using mitomycin C as
a positive control. In line with a reduction in proliferation,
6-MP promoted an accumulation of cells stalled in sub-G1
phase in a time-dependent manner, with 34% of cells in the
sub-G1 phase (fragmented nuclei) after 72 h compared with
13% in the vehicle-incubated cells (Figure 1D), whereas
the proportion of cells in the G1 phase decreased from 38%
to 27%, as expected. This suggests that 6-MP induces cell
cycle alterations by blocking cell cycle at sub-G1 phase.
Together, these results indicate that 6-MP blocks cell cycle
progression and promotes T cell apoptosis.

6-mercaptopurine induces ATP, ADP and AMP
depletion and promotes energetic stress
Since 6-MP interferes with purine metabolism,
we hypothesized that 6-MP reduces ATP production
thereby promoting energetic stress and impacting T cell
metabolism. 6-MP induced a significant reduction in
intracellular ATP content as early as 2 h after initiating
exposition, and this reduction became progressively
more pronounced through 48 h (Figure 2A). Consistent
with an impact of 6-MP on nucleotide synthesis, ADP
and AMP levels are also significantly reduced at 48-h
exposition (Figure 2B). Moreover, ADP/ATP ratio and
AMP/ATP ratio are significantly increased after 48 h
of incubation with 6-MP. Because AMPK is a cellular
energy sensor that depletion or with high AMP/ATP
ratio, we examined the phosphorylation status of the
threonine 172 located in the catalytic subunit of AMPK
by immunoblotting (Figure 2C) [32–34]. We analyzed
the expression levels of phospho-AMPK and total AMPK
after 16- and 48-h incubations with either 6-MP or vehicle
(V). 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide
(AICAR), an analogue of AMP, activates AMPK and was
used as positive control. After 16-h exposition to 6-MP,
no statistical difference was observed in the activation
of AMPK compared to vehicle (V). However, after 48 h
of incubation with 6-MP, phosphorylation of AMPK was
significantly increased. Having shown that 6-MP promotes
ATP depletion and the consequent activation of AMPK,
we reasoned that metabolic modifications likely occur
in response to this energetic stress. 6-MP significantly
altered the level expression of genes involved in glycolysis
and glutaminolysis (Figure 3A, 3B and Supplementary
Figures 2 and 3). Glycolysis-related genes such as glucose6-phosphate isomerase (GPI); hexokinase 2 (HK2);

RESULTS
6-mercaptopurine promotes T cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis
Using a standard concentration of 50 μM [8, 20, 21],
we first determined the impact of 6-MP on Jurkat T cells
proliferation and viability. 6-MP significantly reduced cell
viability in a time-dependent manner (Figure 1A), and
after a 48-h incubation, 50 μM 6-MP reduced viability
by approximately 30% compared with cells treated with
vehicle (V). Since a diminution in cell viability can
result from reduced proliferation and/or increased cell
death, we assessed the impact of 6-MP on apoptosis. We
observed a time-dependent increase in apoptosis, and after
a 48-h incubation with 50 μM 6-MP, 30% of the cells
were apoptotic (Figure 1B), which confirms that 6-MP
promotes apoptosis [29–31]. Furthermore, 6-MP induces
autophagosomes accumulation after 48 h and 72 h of
incubation compared to vehicle (Supplementary Figure 1).
Indeed, LC3 immunoblotting indicates that upon 6-MP

solute carrier family 1, member 5 (SLC1A5); solute carrier
family 38, member 1 (SLC38A1); solute carrier family 3,
member 2 (SLC3A2) and glutamate dehydrogenase 1
(GLUD1) were significantly upregulated. On the other
hand, the expression of genes involved in purine or
pyrimidine synthesis (Figure 3C) including hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), carbamoylphosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and
dihydrooratase (CAD) and transketolase (TKT) were
significantly reduced.
Interestingly, this profile is similar (albeit with
higher intensity) to that of induced by energetic stress
(e.g., glucose/glutamine starvation), during which GPI,

SLC2A3, ENO1, LDHA and of GLUD1 are upregulated,
and genes involved in the PPP pathway and the synthesis
of purines (HGPRT, and inosine 5′-monophosphate
dehydrogenase (IMPDH) 1 and 2, and TKT) and in
the synthesis of pyrimidines (CAD) are significantly
downregulated, which reinforces the assumption that 6-MP
promotes energetic stress in proliferating T cells. Even the
physiological impact of these transcriptomic changes still
requires further elucidation, it is conceivable that these
expression profiles correspond to metabolic rewiring that
would optimize glycolytic and glutaminolytic pathways
(e.g., overexpression of glucose and glutamine transporters
and key enzymes of glycolysis) to produce ATP in
response to an energetic stress. Together, our findings

energetic stress resulting into the altered expression of
genes involved in nucleotide synthesis as well as glucose
and glutamine metabolism.

influx, we observed no difference between vehicle (V)
and 6-MP (Figure 5A), suggesting that 6-MP does not
modify glucose uptake. The expression of SLC2A1,
also known as Glut1 (glucose transporter 1; the main
glucose transporter involved in metabolic reprogramming
[36, 37]), was weakly and very transiently increased upon
6-MP exposure (Figure 5B), indicating that 6-MP has no
effect on glucose influx; in addition, Glut3 expression
was not impacted by 6-MP (Figure 5C). Together, these
results indicate that the metabolic alterations associated
with 6-MP are likely not caused by inhibition of cellular
glucose uptake.

6-mercaptopurine inhibits metabolic checkpoints
and decreases glycolytic and glutaminolytic
fluxes
Having shown that 6-MP promotes energetic stress
and impacts the expression of genes involved in glycolysis
(i.e., the degradation of glucose into pyruvate [35]) and
glutaminolysis, we hypothesized that 6-MP modulates the
expression of metabolic checkpoints, leading to alteration
of cell metabolism. The expression levels of HIF-1α and
Myc were significantly decreased in T cells incubated
with 6-MP for 24 h and 48 h (Figure 4A, 4B), and in the
same experimental conditions, 6-MP also significantly
reduced p70S6K phosphorylation, indicating that mTOR
activity was inhibited. These effects were maintained up
to 72 h of exposition to 6-MP (Supplementary Figure
4). Consistent with the downregulation of metabolic
checkpoints in T cells, the metabolic activity of T cells
was profoundly impacted by 6-MP. As measured by the
rate of CO2 released from U-14C-glucose and U-14Cglutamine, glucose and glutamine oxidation capacities
through the TCA (tricarboxylic acid cycle) followed by
OXPHOS (Figure 4C, 4D), were significantly decreased
by 60% and 35%, respectively, after a 48-h incubation
with 6-MP, indicating that the oxidation capacities of
Jurkat cells from glucose and glutamine substrates were
drastically reduced upon exposition to 6-MP. Since 6-MP
inhibited glucose degradation from glycolysis to TCA
and OXPHOS, glucose metabolism could be redirected
toward lactic acid production (i.e., pyruvate conversion
into lactate [35]). However, the production of lactate,
which is a marker of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect
[25, 28]) and is reflected by the extracellular lactate
concentration, was significantly decreased by 30% (Figure
4E), indicating that aerobic glycolysis is also inhibited by
6-MP. Together, these data indicate that 6-MP inhibits
the metabolic checkpoints mTOR, HIF-1α and Myc and
decreases both the glucose and glutamine catabolism
through glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

DISCUSSION
We provide for the first time a comprehensive
characterization of the impact of 6-MP exposition in
proliferating T cell metabolism. Our results indicate that
6-MP produces an early drop in ATP production followed
by transcriptional reprogramming of genes involved in
glycolysis, glutaminolysis and nucleotide synthesis; these
changes are similar to those observed upon energetic
stress. These metabolic alterations are associated with
the inhibition of the metabolic checkpoints mTORC1,
HIF-1α and Myc are functionally characterized by a
reduction of the glycolytic and glutaminolytic fluxes. As a
unifying mechanism, we propose that, following early ATP
depletion occurring during 6-MP treatment, the metabolic
sensor AMPK is activated by phosphorylation, and, in
turn, inhibits mTORC1. Besides the inhibition of purine
synthesis, the biochemical basis for rapid ATP depletion
induced by 6-MP remains to be established. Since
mTORC1 regulates the expression of Myc and HIF-1α,
mTORC1 inhibition upon ATP depletion may induce the
inhibition of Myc and HIF-1α expression. Consequently,
a marked reduction of the glycolytic and glutaminolytic
fluxes is observed due to a decrease of the expression of
enzymes and transporters under the control of Myc and
HIF-1α involved in glycolysis such pyruvate kinase M and
in glutaminolysis such as GLS1 and 2. In addition, ATP
depletion induced by 6-MP could impact glycolytic and
glutaminoytic fluxes as a result of the inhibition of ATPdependent enzymes, such as hexokinase.
These results provide new insights into how
incubation with 6-MP, which induces ATP depletion,
promotes metabolic stress and adds a possible mechanism
by which 6-MP inhibits cell proliferation. In addition, this
finding underscores the critical role of ATP production in
proliferating T cells, including the Jurkat T cell line [38].
Jurkat cells have high intracellular ATP concentration
and generate more extracellular ATP than resting T cells.
As a result, increased purinergic signaling through P2X
receptors elevates the baseline levels of cytosolic Ca2+ in
Jurkat cells, which fosters proliferation [38]. Consistent
with this, we have recently demonstrated that 6-MPresistant lymphoblastoid cell lines grow more slowly

6-mercaptopurine does not modify either glucose
uptake or Glut1 and Glut3 expression
Cellular glucose influx is a rate-limiting step of
glycolysis, and we observed global shutdown of glucose
metabolism in cells exposed to 6-MP. Therefore, we
asked whether 6-MP can reduce glucose uptake to cause
energetic stress and metabolic disruption. Upon measuring
the cellular uptake of 3H-2-Deoxyglucose (a radioactive
glucose analogue phosphorylated by hexokinases but
that cannot undergo glycolysis) to monitor glucose

than 6-MP-sensitive cells, suggesting the importance
of basal proliferation rate of cells in anticipating the
antiproliferative action of 6-MP [15]. Together, these
results underscore the critical role of the maintain of ATP
homeostasis in leukemic T cells and offer the opportunity
to reassess the beneficial effects of 6-MP as a therapeutic
approach in association with other antiproliferative agents
that would target multiple metabolic pathways crucial
for cell proliferation. In addition, it would be interesting
to determine if variations in key molecules regulating
glycolysis and glutaminolysis could be surrogate
biomarkers of the interindividual variability in the clinical
response to 6-MP by and if so monitoring metabolic
reprogramming could be useful to predict 6-MP efficacy.
Whether the effect of 6-MP on the metabolic
reprogramming of Jurkat T cells can be generalize to
other situations during which T cells rapidly grow such
as naive T cells upon antigen presentation (that is, in a
non-oncological setting) remains to be demonstrated.
Our results cannot be directly translated into medical
situation other that leukemia because Jurkat cells may
not be informative of normal T cell responses. This cell
line is not dependent on T-cell receptor (TCR) signals for
nutrient utilization, cell cycle progression and growth. In
addition, due to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)

loss, Jurkat T cells have a deregulated PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway activation with constitutively elevated Akt
activity. Hence, our findings are relevant for leukemiarelated situations, but cannot be directly extrapolated into
adaptive immunity. However, when accounting for the role
of metabolic checkpoints, including HIF-1α and mTOR,
and metabolic reprogramming in naive T-cell polarization
and proliferation [39–41], it is reasonable to envision that
the immunosuppressive properties of 6-MP, are, at least
partially, explained by its effects on ATP production.
Along these lines, deciphering the impact of other
immunosuppressive agents on metabolic reprogramming,
including mycophenolate mofetil which inhibits the ratelimiting enzyme of de novo purine synthesis, could yield
new insights on its mechanisms of action with important
therapeutic implications. Indeed, identifying molecular
circuitries that regulate cell metabolism and could
eventually be targeted by immunosuppressive drugs is
a strong approach to design drugs that block metabolic
checkpoints in a complementary manner.
Nevertheless, the impact of 6-MP on metabolic
reprogramming appears to be cell-dependent, as opposing
effects have been reported. 6-MP induces stabilization of
HIF-1α in the HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell line [21],
whereas 6-MP decreases HIF-1α protein expression in

our model. Regarding glucose uptake, in the L6 model
of rat skeletal muscle, 6-MP increases glucose uptake
and Glut4 (SLC2A4, solute carrier family 2, member 4)
translocation to the cell surface, a process mediated
by NR4A3 [42]. The fact that T cells do not express
Glut4 [37] may explain why 6-MP does not promote
increased glucose uptake in our model. Since the precise
mechanisms that cause the adverse effects of 6-MP (e.g.,
acute liver and pancreatic injuries, sinusoidal epithelial
damage (peliosis)) are mostly unknown, one cannot
exclude that metabolic perturbations induced by 6-MP
in metabolically sensitive cells could be involved in the
occurrence of these side effects. In addition, multiple
mechanisms are likely involved in the regulation of critical
metabolic pathways by 6-MP, and which may be cell-type
dependent. For example, we observed that 6-MP activated
autophagy, as a probable result of mTOR inhibition and
ATP depletion, whereas in HCT116 colorectal cancer
cells and HEC59 human endometrial cancer cells,
6-TG-induced DNA damage and P53 activation drove
autophagy [43]. Nevertheless, these distinct mechanisms
are not exclusive, and whether P53 signaling is activated
upon 6-MP exposure remains to be determined. The
impact of the energetic stress induced by 6-MP on cell
viability, and in comparison with established mechanisms
such as incorporation 6-TG in DNA, Rac-1 inhibition
and de novo purine synthesis remains to be established.
However, the specific delineation of the impact of the
energetic stress induced by 6-MP is complicated by the
interdependence of the signaling pathways activated
in the same time by 6-MP. For example, DNA damage
induced by 6-TG activate P53 signaling, which, in turn,
can impact metabolic checkpoints and cell metabolism.
In addition, the metabolic changes induced by 6-MP
correspond to an adaptive process, and AMPK activation,
mTOR inhibition and autophagy have prosurvival, rather
than proapoptotic properties. Since these “beneficial”
pathways are activated in parallel to prodeath pathways
(such as DNA damage and P53) the net effect on cell
viability will depend on many parameters, including cell
type, the intensity and the duration of the stress, and the
coexistence of sensitizing factors.
In conclusion, our findings offer new insights on
the cellular effects of 6-MP on metabolic alterations by
demonstrating that 6-MP promotes an early energetic
stress that impacts proliferation and increases apoptosis
in proliferating T cells. The most significant result of our
study was the inhibition of the metabolic checkpoints
mTOR, HIF-1α and Myc by 6-MP which was associated
with global inhibition of glycolytic and glutaminolytic
fluxes into the TCA cycle. Finally, our findings might
provide an original rational approach to better redesign
therapeutic combinations of antiproliferative agents
with the aim of controlling cell metabolism by targeting
different metabolic pathways.

Cell culture and chemicals
Jurkat T leukemia cells (clone E6-1, Lot Number
60628582, received November 2014) were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA). Jurkat cells are T lymphocytes obtained
from a peripheral blood of 14 years-old male with acute
T cell leukemia, and they express CD3 and CD25. In the
manuscript, we used the terms “T cells” or “Jurkat cells”
indistinctively. Cells were maintained at 37°C in RPMI

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/mL of penicillin and
50 μg/mL of streptomycin. Cell cultures were maintained
at a density of 5 × 105 cells/mL. This cell line was
mycoplasma-free (Mycoalert Mycoplasma Detection
Kit, Lonza, Slough, UK). 6-MP, 5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) and mitomycin C
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA).
Energetic stress was produced in culturing cells for
16 h in a medium SILAC RPMI 1640 (ref. A2494201
from Gibco®) without glucose and glutamine and not
supplemented with FBS but with 50 U/mL of penicillin
and 50 μg/mL of streptomycin.

Viability studies
Jurkat cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 105
cells/mL), and the relative number of living cells
per well was determined by using the CellTiter 96®
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay with
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)2-(4-sul-fophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Cell apoptosis assay
The cell apoptosis assay was performed as described
previously [44]. Jurkat cells were seeded in 12-well
plates (5 × 105 cells/mL) and incubated with 50 μM 6-MP
or vehicle (V) for 24, 48 or 72 h. After the incubations,
apoptosis was analyzed by mixing 25 µL of cell suspension
with 25 µL of an ethidium bromide (EB, 500 μg/mL) and
acridine orange (AO, 150 μg/mL) mixture. Cell morphology
was studied using a fluorescence microscope. Between 100
and 200 cells were counted per condition. Live cells were
stained green, and apoptotic cells were stained orange with
shrunken and fragmented nuclei. Among all cells counted,
the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated.

RNA extraction and real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
RNA extraction and RT-qPCR was performed
as previously described [45]. Briefly, total RNA was
43056

Lactate measurements

extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit® (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transcription expression levels were assessed by using
a SYBR Green RT-qPCR kit with an ABI-PRISM 7900
sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). The fold changes for each tested gene
were normalized to the housekeeping gene ribosomal
protein L13A (RPL13A). The relative expression of
each gene was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method [46].
Accordingly, the expression level of a given gene in
the control samples (vehicle-treated) using the 2−ΔΔCT
method was set to 1. Comparison of the expression of
genes after exposition was visualized as heat maps.
Primers sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Lactate secretion was measured using the Lactate
Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision Inc,
Milpitas, CA, USA) in Krebs phosphate buffer (at pH
7.6, 6.3 g/L NaCl, 320 mg/L KCl, 140 mg/L CaCl2,
148  mg/L KH2PO4, 267 mg/L MgSO4 and 1.91 g/L
NaHCO3) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The absorption values were plotted against a lactate
standard curve to determine the lactate concentrations in
the samples.

Metabolic assays
Glucose and glutamine oxidation flux were
determined by the rate of 14CO2 released from 14C-Uglucose and 14C-U-glutamine, respectively. Jurkat cells
were treated for 48 h with 50 µM 6-MP. Then, 5 × 106 cells
were resuspended in 950 μL of Krebs-Ringer phosphate
buffer supplemented with either 5 mM 14C-U-glucose
(11 GBq/mmol, isotopic dilution 1/1000, Perkin Elmer)
or 4 mM 14C-U-glutanime (9.69 GBq/mmol, isotopic
dilution 1/1000, Perkin Elmer). After a 90-min incubation
at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 250 μL of 6
N H2SO4, and CO2 was recovered for 1 h in benzethonium
hydroxide. The radioactive CO2 was counted by using
liquid scintillation (Ultima Gold, Perkin Elmer).

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Immunoblotting was performed as previously
described [47]. Total protein lysates were separated
by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide (SDSPAGE) gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions
and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membrane (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
They were incubated with Anti-Phospho-p70 S6
Kinase (Thr421/Ser424), Anti-c-Myc, Anti-AMPKα,
Anti-Phospho-AMPKα (Thr172) (1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology); or Anti-HIF-1α, Anti-Glut1
(1:1000, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA);
Anti-Glut3 (1:1000, Novus Biologicals, Littleton,
CO, USA); Anti-LC3B (1:2000, Cell Signaling
Technology) or Anti-β actin (1:10000, Sigma-Aldrich)
and were visualized using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated polyclonal secondary antibodies (Dako
(Cambridge, UK) or Cell Signaling Technology Inc
(Hitchin, UK)) and detected by an ECL reagent® (GE
Healthcare). Digital images were analyzed by ImageJ
Software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Glucose uptake
Glucose uptake was measured according to the
method described by Hardonnière et al. [48] with some
modifications. After the incubation of cells with 50 µM
6-MP for 48 h, 5 × 106 cells were washed with PBS and
incubated in 5 mL of RPMI 1640 glucose-free medium
supplemented with 10% SVF and 2 mM of glutamine at
37°C for 3 h. After this starvation period, cells were washed
and incubated with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer for an
additional 30 min at 37°C followed by incubation with
0.1 mM 3H-2-Deoxyglucose (isotopic dilution of 1:4000)
for 10 min at 37°C. After the cells were gently washed
twice with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, the
cell pellets were lysed by adding 250 μL of 0.1 N NaOH.
Half of the sample content was transferred into scintillation
vials, and the radiolabelled glucose incorporated into the
cells was measured by using Ultima Gold and reading
the samples on a liquid scintillation counter. The protein
content for each condition was assayed by using the
remaining half of the sample with a Pierce™ BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

ATP detection assay
A total of 103 cells per well were plated in 96-well
plates, and the ATP levels were measured using an ATPlite
2 steps Kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s conditions. Luminescence was
measured at a microplate luminescence counter Enspire
Multilabel Reader 2300 (Perkin Elmer). Each condition
was measured in triplicate.

ADP and AMP detection assay

Flow cytometry

AMP, ADP and AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios were
measured using ATP/ADP/AMP Assay Kit (University at
Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Luminescence was measured as for ATP detection
assay. Each condition was measured in triplicate.
