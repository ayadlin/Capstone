Testing for Uridine Diphosphate
Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 Before
Irinotecan Administration for
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of using a pharmacogenetic test for uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 1A1*28 (UGT1A1*28) variant homozygosity before
administering irinotecan to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: A decision-analytic
model from the Medicare payer perspective followed hypothetical patients who were treated with combined 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan. Under usual care, patients received a full dose of irinotecan.
With genetic testing, irinotecan dosage was reduced 25% in homozygotes with the UGT1A1*28 variant allele. Test performance, chemotherapy toxicity, and quality-of-life weights were derived from clinical literature and product labels, and costs were derived from 2007 Medicare fee schedules. Chemotherapy efficacy
after dose reduction, adverse event risk, and other parameters were varied in 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The authors also calculated the value of investing in further studies of chemotherapy efficacy after homozygote dose reductions. RESULTS: Pretreatment genetic testing costs less ($272 savings
per patient tested) and yields slightly improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.1 quality-adjusted day
per patient tested; approximately 2 quality-adjusted hours). Results depended on treatment efficacy but
not adverse event risk assumptions. The results indicated that testing would avoid 84 cases of severe neutropenia, including 4.4 deaths. At a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year, the therapeutic efficacy of irinotecan in homozygotes after dose reduction had to be 98.4% of full-dose efficacy for genetic
testing to remain preferred. Future studies to determine whether this efficacy level can be achieved have
an economic value of $22 million. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that pharmacogenetic testing for UGT1A1*28 variant homozygosity may be cost effective, but only if irinotecan dose reduction in
homozygotes does not reduce efficacy. Future studies to evaluate reduced-dose efficacy in homozygotes

Cost Effectiveness of UGT1A1 Testing/Gold et al

KEY WORDS: genotype testing, UGT1A1, irinotecan, cost-effectiveness analysis, colorectal cancer.

In 2008, colorectal cancer was diagnosed in >150,000
men and women in the United States.1 Despite advances in
screening and early detection, nearly 20% of patients present with metastatic disease.1 Many others will develop
recurrent and/or unresectable colorectal cancer after completing adjuvant therapy and will be eligible for palliative
chemotherapy to control their disease. Although oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimens (eg, combined folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin plus
bevacizumab) currently are favored for first-line treatment,
regimens that contain irinotecan are accepted and sued
widely in the first-line, second-line, and third-line (metastatic) settings.2,3
Neutropenia is a serious side effect of irinotecan treatment, particularly in patients with decreased uridine
diphosphate (UDP)-glucunorosyltransferase activity.4
Administered as a prodrug, irinotecan undergoes enzymatic
conversion by carboxyesterase-2 to yield the clinically active
metabolite, SN-38. This active form interferes with tumor
cell division by inhibiting the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I.5 SN-38 is eliminated from the body through the biliary system after a process of glucuronidation (conjugation
to glucuronic acid) through the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 enzyme. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated that individuals who are
homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 variant are at increased
risk of irinotecan-related neutropenia and diarrhea, particularly when irinotecan is administered at higher doses.4,6-9
This likely is because of markedly reduced messenger RNA
transcription, leading to decreased overall enzyme production, slower SN-38 glucuronidation, and a greater SN-38
plasma concentration over time, which results in prolonged
exposure to the unconjugated form of SN-38.10 Approximately 11% of North Americans may be homozygous for
this allele, although it is known that the prevalence is lower
among Asian-Americans and African-Americans compared
with Caucasians.5
In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved a UGT1A1 genotype test to help identify patients with a greater risk for decreased UDP-glucunorosyltransferase activity11 and, thus, with an increased

risk of irinotecan-induced neutropenia. The manufacturer’s label for irinotecan now recommends that physicians ‘‘consider’’ a dose-reduction of ‘‘at least 1 level’’
(equivalent to approximately a 17% to 34% dose reduction) when administering the drug to patients who are
known to be homozygous for UGT1A1*28, but the final
label also notes that the precise dose reduction in this population is unknown.12
Data are limited regarding the effects of irinotecan
dose reduction on the incidence of side effects or on overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. A recent
meta-analysis indicated that lower doses (<150 mg/m2),
versus medium doses (150-250 mg/m2) and high doses
(>250 mg/m2), were associated with a lower probability
of severe neutropenia in homozygotes.9 In addition, little
is known about the costs associated with implementing
UGT1A1 testing. Indeed, few cost-effectiveness studies
have been conducted of pharmacogenetic tests for inherited mutations of any kind.13 The objective of the current
study was to perform an economic evaluation of the use of
pharmacogenetic testing to guide dosing of irinotecan versus irinotecan administration according to usual care in
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model Overview
We created a decision-analytic model from the Medicare
payer perspective using TreeAge Pro 2008 (Williamstown, Mass)14 to evaluate the cost effectiveness of testing
for the UGT1A1*28 genotype before irinotecan administration in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer compared with usual care (no testing) (Fig. 1). Hypothetical
patients in the model were treated with 5-fluorouracil and
leucovorin plus irinotecan (FOLFIRI) at a standard intermediate dose (175 mg/m2) that was calculated for a
patient who had a body surface area of 1.85 m2 (eg, an
individual 5 feet, 10 inches tall who weighed 70 kg).15,16
We chose to study the FOLFIRI regimen for the model
because it is the irinotecan-containing regimen for which
the most data on UGT1A1*28 testing and outcomes

currently are available. In the usual care strategy, all
patients received a standard intermediate dose of irinotecan. In the genetic testing strategy, patients underwent
UGT1A1*28 testing before FOLFIRI administration.
Those who were identified as homozygous for the
UGT1A1*28 variant allele received a 25% dose reduction
of irinotecan therapy to 131.25 mg/m2 based on the
FDA’s label suggesting a dose reduction of at least 1 level,
whereas all other patients received the full dose.
We began by assuming that the FOLFIRI regimen
had 100% efficacy in all patients and had the same efficacy
at a reduced dose among homozygotes as a full dose among
heterozygotes or wild types, because there is slower glucuronidation and a greater plasma concentration of SN-38 in
homozygotes.6 Then, this assumption was varied along
with other model inputs in 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. A recent study indicated that response rates
were not different between homozygotes, heterozygotes, or
wild types, although homozygotes experienced more frequent dose reductions because of adverse events.17
We report incremental costs and quality-adjusted
life expectancy when comparing the 2 strategies and the
economic value of additional investment to reduce uncertainties in the modeling assumptions. We also report the
estimated number of severe neutropenia events and deaths
avoided by testing.
Adverse Events and Life Expectancy
Severe adverse events associated with irinotecan include
grade 3 or 4 (severe) neutropenia.18,19 The risks of severe
neutropenia were derived from randomized trials of irinotecan administration in genotyped populations (Table 1).8,20
Among homozygotes, the probability of severe neutropenia
3860

declined from 14% to 3.7% after genetic testing and dose
reduction (vs 3.7% in the rest of the population) based
on a study indicating that such dose reductions decreased
the risk of a severe adverse event to a risk that was statistically equivalent to that of heterozygotes and wild types
(P ¼ .2).8 We reduced this benefit in sensitivity analyses.
A fraction (23%) of patients experiencing severe neutropenia were assumed to be admitted to the hospital for
management of febrile neutropenia,21 and the remainder
were assumed to be treated on an outpatient basis.
Because of the very small number of deaths caused by
adverse events reported in each trial,15,22-26 we assumed
that the probability of death during a hospitalization for
severe or febrile neutropenia was 0.1% (Table 1). The
assumed life expectancy after FOLFIRI treatment was 24
months.27

Test Characteristics and Allele Prevalence
Genetic testing was assumed to be conducted using the Invader molecular assay developed by Third Wave Technologies (Madison, Wis), an FDA-approved test for
UGT1A1*28 genotyping.28 Sensitivity and specificity of
the assay were reported on the FDA website as 100%.29
However, we assumed sensitivity and specificity of 99.99%
to allow for a small chance of a laboratory error that would
affect test results. In the North American population, the
prevalence of homozygotes was estimated at 11%.30

Quality of Life and Costs

severe neutropenia (Table 1). A baseline weight of 0.83
was used for the population of metastatic colorectal cancer
patients.31 Severe neutropenic events were assumed to last
1 week, leading to an additional decrement in quality of
life during that week. Febrile neutropenia alone reportedly has been associated with a quality-of-life value of
0.42 (equivalent to a utility decrement of 0.58 from perfect health).32 The quality of life of patients experiencing
both metastatic colorectal cancer and a severe neutropenic
event (febrile neutropenia) simultaneously was estimated
at 0.42 during 1 week using a lowest value approach.33
We used the Medicare payer perspective to evaluate
costs. The model included costs of UGT1A1*28 testing,34
costs of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia,35 cost of a
Cancer

a reduced dose in homozygotes.37 The model did not
include the cost of subsequent chemotherapy, because the
wide variety of possible treatments available impaired our
ability to calculate this cost with an acceptable degree of
accuracy. We wanted to estimate the maximum amount
of future medical costs that might be incurred as a result
of patients living longer because of the use of the test while
still having the test be cost effective. Therefore, we estimated the threshold value at which the benefit of genetic
testing would be offset by the additional expected lifetime
medical costs from improved survival induced by genetic
testing. All costs were reported in 2007 US dollars.

Quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3% per year, in accordance
with the recommendation of the Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine.38

Sensitivity Analyses
We performed 1-way sensitivity analyses on the efficacy of
FOLFIRI dose reduction, incidence of and mortality
from severe neutropenic events, genetic test performance,
cost, and quality-of-life model inputs for a specified range
of values (Table 1). It is noteworthy that we varied the efficacy of a dose reduction from 75% to 100% of full-dose
efficacy; in the model, a reduction in efficacy resulted in a
proportional reduction in life expectancy after FOLFIRI
treatment (eg, a 75% reduction in efficacy resulted in
a reduction in life expectancy from 24 months to
18 months). We also considered different methods for
combining quality-of-life weights for severe neutropenia
and metastatic colorectal cancer.33
We evaluated the impact of substituting a societal
perspective for the Medicare payer perspective by adding
$900 to reflect the value of patient time associated with
hospitalization39 and reducing the cost of the
UGT1A1*28 test from $103 (the Medicare reimbursement rate) to $75, which represented the estimated cost to
conduct the test in a hospital laboratory.

By using results from the probabilistic sensitivity
analysis with a WTP threshold of $100,000 per QALY,
we estimated the value of obtaining better quality data to
reduce uncertainties in our model and, thus, the value
that represented the maximum amount that should be
spent to conduct a study of dose reductions in homozygotes. First, we calculated the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). EVPI can be interpreted as the value of
completely removing the possibility of making an incorrect decision based on the current analysis because of its
inherent uncertainty.42 Then, we calculated the expected
value of partial perfect information (partial EVPI) for
resolving just the uncertainty about the efficacy of a
reduced dose of irinotecan in homozygotes. The partial
EVPI represents the maximum value society should be
willing to pay to eliminate the uncertainty about the efficacy assumption alone. We assumed that the test would
continue to be useful for 5 years before being replaced by
new technologies and that the size of the population to
which the test could be applied was 29,260 patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer annually,21 63% of whom we
estimate are aged 65 years based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 1973 through
2002.43 Finally we compared the partial EVPI with how
much a clinical study might cost to improve decision
making concerning dose reductions.

RESULTS
Value of Information
We conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations that varied all noncost variables simultaneously with a willingness-to-pay
(WTP) threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life
year (QALY).40 We applied triangular distributions41 for
all parameters, in which the peak was equal to the initial
value and the lower and upper bounds were equal to the
lowest or highest values reported in the literature. The
exceptions to triangular distributions were those for which
data were very limited: chemotherapy efficacy, quality-oflife weights, and probability of hospitalization for neutropenia. We selected uniform distributions for these parameters, because they reflect the highest possible degree of
uncertainty and are the least ‘‘informative,’’ as they represent the distribution of possible values as a straight line
within a range.

Adverse Events and Cost Effectiveness
For every 10,000 patients tested, 1100 (11%) would
receive a 25% dose reduction as a result of being identified
as homozygous for UGT1A1*28. On average, this treatment strategy would avoid 84.5 cases of severe neutropenia (including 4.5 deaths because of neutropenia) and
would save $2.7 million in treatment costs. Taking into
account the cost of testing and assuming no reduction in
treatment efficacy, the average cost savings and qualityadjusted life expectancy savings per patient tested were
$272.34 and 0.073 quality-adjusted days (Table 2),
respectively (not even 2 quality-adjusted hours). If all
29,000 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer diagnosed each year in the US received chemotherapy that
included irinotecan, then the estimated net annual savings
could be as high as $7.96 million and 6 QALYs as a result

of avoiding 245 severe neutropenic events (including 13
fatal events).
The results were sensitive to the efficacy of a reduced
dose and were somewhat sensitive to the cost of the
genetic test, but not to the risk of an adverse event. In 1way sensitivity analyses, the estimated efficacy of a
reduced dose of irinotecan administered to homozygous
carriers after testing must be at least 98.4% of full-dose efficacy for testing to remain the preferred strategy at a
WTP threshold of $100,000 per QALY (Table 2), which
means that efficacy in homozygotes must hold nearly constant after a dose reduction. The cost of the genetic test
must be <$395 (vs the current Medicare cost of $103) for
testing to remain the preferred strategy at a WTP threshold of $100,000 per QALY; at < $375, testing both cost
less and increased QALYs. Results were not sensitive to
the range of values tested for adverse events (incidence of
and mortality from severe neutropenia); for example, if
the probability of severe neutropenia after dose reduction
in homozygotes was 10.5% (25% reduction) versus 3.7%,
then the threshold for treatment efficacy of a reduced dose
was 98.3%. Results were also not sensitive to life expectCancer

ancy, genetic test performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity), or quality-of-life weights (data not shown). Adopting
a societal perspective by incorporating patient time costs
and a lower test cost did not change the optimal strategy
or trends in the sensitivity analyses.
The threshold analysis indicated that, for genetic
testing to remain the dominant strategy, the average cost
for the 13 patients who would avoid death because of a
severe neutropenic event cannot exceed $618,955 per
patient during their remaining life expectancy after completion of the FOLFIRI regimen. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, testing dominated usual care in only 9.1% of
simulations. Usual care was preferred in 72% of simulations and in an additional 7.5% when usual care resulted
in an increase in QALYs, but it was above the WTP
threshold of $100,000 per QALY (Fig. 2).

irinotecan dose reduction in homozygotes would be justified based on a WTP threshold of $100,000 per QALY if
irinotecan remained an accepted and widely used treatment alternative for patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer in the United States for the next 5 years. Because
Medicare primarily provides health insurance coverage for
patients aged 65 years (including approximately 18,000
patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer in
this age group each year), the partial EVPI just from the
Medicare perspective was $13.8 million. The total EVPI
was $21.4 million, or $13.4 million from the Medicare
perspective, which was slightly lower than the partial
EVPI. The higher partial EVPI is probably because of the
large and important effect of the efficacy variable in the
model, which is not reflected fully in the total EVPI,
because uncertainty in other model parameters is correlated with uncertainty in the efficacy parameter and works
in the opposite direction.

DISCUSSION
Pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to fundamentally alter risk-benefit tradeoffs associated with pharmacotherapy, introducing ‘‘personalized medicine’’ concepts
into clinical practice. Cost-effectiveness analyses of pharmacogenetic tests can provide important insights into the
3864

relative economic value of this new management paradigm, but few of these cost-effectiveness studies have been
published.13,44 To our knowledge, this is the first costeffectiveness study of UGT1A1*28 testing to guide
chemotherapy dosing of irinotecan. Testing itself would
cost up to $3 million per year, given the test cost and eligible population. We observed that incorporating
UGT1A1*28 testing into the clinical management of
patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer treated
with irinotecan may result in lower overall medical costs
and higher quality-adjusted life expectancy, but our findings were sensitive to several uncertainties in the model’s
parameter estimates, as indicated by the sensitivity analyses. In particular, maintenance of the clinical efficacy of
irinotecan after dose reduction in UGT1A1*28 homozygotes was a key determinant of cost-effectiveness results.
That is, if treatment efficacy is not fully maintained after
the FDA-recommended dose reduction of irinotecan,
then testing will not be a cost-effective alternative. The
small reduction in treatment-related risks (severe neutropenia and/or death) gained by testing is outweighed by
the risk of shortened survival because of under-treatment.
However, limited data in this area do suggest that homozygotes experience slower glucuronidation and a greater
plasma concentration of SN-386 and that response rates
are not different between homozygotes, heterozygotes, or
wild types, even with differential dose reductions across
groups.17
Our analysis indicates that the federal government
should be willing to invest in further research to reduce
the uncertainty associated with UGT1A1 genotype testing
and irinotecan dose reduction. Specifically, at a WTP
threshold of $100,000 per QALY and with a 5-year time
horizon for the genetic testing technology, the federal government should consider investing at least $13.8 million
specifically to evaluate the efficacy of a reduced irinotecan
dose in UGTA1*28 homozygous patients with colorectal
cancer aged 65 years. By comparison, the estimated
expected cost to conduct an average phase 3 clinical trial is
$27.1 million (in 2000 US dollars),45 although some analysts consider this to be a 2-4-fold overestimate.46,47 The
cost to conduct a clinical trial in homozygotes may differ
substantially from this amount, however, because irinotecan is not a novel therapeutic entity and already has been
proven effective in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Alternatively, an observational clinical study could be

considered that might provide valuable information more
quickly.
This analysis is subject to limitations. First, the
probabilities of severe neutropenia and death from neutropenia in patients with colorectal cancer were difficult
to estimate, because data were drawn from randomized
controlled trials using different regimens, patients were
monitored more closely in clinical trials than in usual care
(with dose reductions for patients with adverse events),
and the number of events or deaths in any 1 trial was small
or nil. Because we used estimates drawn from clinical trials, our results may underestimate the value of genetic
testing to avoid these events. Conversely, dose reductions
reported in some studies were greater than the dose reduction we modeled based on the FDA label. Results were
consistent, however, when we varied the amount of dose
reduction benefit from avoiding adverse events. Second,
there were only 2 published clinical trials that reported
results in a relatively small number of genotyped patients.
So, although genetic test sensitivity and specificity are
fairly well established, estimates of clinical sensitivity and
specificity—or the probabilities that a positive test predicts an adverse event or death—have a wide range.
Although we accounted for the finding that a patient with
severe neutropenia could be hospitalized versus treated on
an outpatient basis, this is likely to depend on local care
patterns and patient ability to self-manage at home. Varying this parameter, however, did not affect the model
results.
We also did not consider alternative dosing
approaches. For instance, the results from a study by Toffoli and colleagues8 indicated that successfully administering full-dose irinotecan in UGT1A1*28 homozygotes can
produce superior response rates compared with nonhomozygotes (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval,
0.04-0.89), albeit with higher rates of hematologic and
nonhematologic toxicities (odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-17.9). This suggests that the magnitude of the recommended dose reduction in homozygotes
should be considered carefully, because a potential effectiveness advantage (ie, improved response rate and/or survival) may be compromised significantly. In addition,
alternative dosing regimens of irinotecan may have different safety profiles, and the importance of UGT1A1*28
status may be enhanced or reduced depending on pharmacodynamic parameters associated with the dosing schedCancer

ule. Finally, prophylactic use of agents like pegfilgrastim
or filgrastim could help reduce the incidence of neutropenia in homozygotes,48 thereby allowing a full dose of irinotecan to be used in the first cycle but also contributing
to the cost of this treatment strategy.
Our analysis focused on the use of irinotecan for the
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The broad therapeutic application of irinotecan (eg, tumors of the upper
gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system49-51) also
should be taken into account when considering both the
clinical impact of dosing recommendations and the
potential economic value of pharmacogenetic testing. The
proportion of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
who eventually will receive irinotecan is not known; however, if <29,214 cancer patients were expected to receive
irinotecan in a year, then the value of future research
would decrease.
Cost-effectiveness analysis can help policy makers
evaluate the clinical utility of new medical technologies
like pharmacogenetic tests, make decisions about reimbursement, and identify priorities and investment levels
for further research. In the case of UGT1A1*28 testing,
we observed that routine testing may improve clinical outcomes and quality of life slightly but is only cost saving if
clinical efficacy (survival) is maintained after an irinotecan
dose reduction in homozygotes. Further studies to evaluate the impact of irinotecan dose reduction on clinical efficacy would be worth an investment of up to $13.8 million
dollars based on the impact of such testing on costs, life
expectancy, and quality of life for Medicare beneficiaries
alone and even more if all use of irinotecan were considered.
