BACKGROUND. Topical antifungal treatments are recommended but rarely used as
first-line therapy for oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in patients with cancer.
Miconazole Lauriad 50-mg mucoadhesive buccal tablet (MBT) Loramyc reportedly delivered rapid and prolonged, effective concentrations of miconazole in the
mouth. The objective of the current study was to compare MBT with miconazole
500-mg oral gel (MOG) in patients with head and neck cancer.

METHODS. Two hundred eighty-two patients with head and neck cancer received
a 14-day treatment of either single-dose MBT or MOG administered in 4 divided
doses. The primary endpoint was clinical success at Day 14, and secondary endpoints included clinical success at Day 7, clinical cure, improvement in clinical
symptoms, mycologic cure, recurrence rate, and safety.

RESULTS. The success rate was statistically not inferior (P <.0001) in the MBT population to the rate observed in the MOG group (56% vs 49%, respectively; P < .0001).
After adjustment for the extent of lesions and salivary secretions, a trend toward
superiority was observed in favor of MBT (P 5 .13), particularly among patients
with multiple lesions (P 5 .013). Results for secondary endpoints were comparable
to those observed for the primary endpoint. Compliance with MBT was excellent,
and >80% of patients completed treatment. Both treatments were safe.

CONCLUSIONS. The success rate of MBT Loramyc was significantly not inferior to
that of MOG in the treatment of cancer patients with OPC; and, after adjusting

thus, may be recommended as first-line treatment in cancer patients who have OPC as

C

andida is present in the oral cavity in 40% to
60% of healthy individuals and is not harmful. In
immunocompromised patients, it can become
aggressive, induce oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC),
invade the digestive tract and even lead to systemic
infections.1
OPC is the most common oral fungal infection
in cancer patients,2–5 with a mean incidence between
30% and 70%.6 Its occurrence is favored by chemotherapy- and/or radiation therapy-induced xerostomia and mucositis.7 In cancer patients, it results in
oral discomfort and marked reduction in food and
liquid consumption, it contributes to poor nutritional
status, and it strongly deteriorates quality of life.6
Patients with head and neck cancer are particularly susceptible to OPC, because they usually suffer
from both markedly reduced salivary secretion and
radiation therapy-induced mucositis.8–13 The occurrence of OPC in these patients further deteriorates
the oral mucosa; increases pain, dysphagia, and anorexia; alters taste; and contributes toward worsening
nutritional and general status. Recurrence occurs in
approximately 33% of patients.13
The objectives of the treatment of OPC are to
eliminate signs and symptoms of the disease and to
prevent recurrence. The Infectious Disease Society of
America recommends treating initial episodes of
OPC with topical treatments and reserving systemic
treatments for frequently recurrent episodes of OPC
and for esophageal dissemination.14 In practice,
these recommendations are not followed mainly
because of the need for 4 to 6 daily dosing and the
poor taste acceptance of topical agents, which compromise patient compliance and may lead to poor/
moderate efficacy. Consequently, despite their risk
for drug-drug interactions and liver toxicity, oncedaily dosing azole agents that improve patient compliance progressively have replaced topical drugs.
The large use of fluconazole recently has been
implicated in the selection and development of resistant strains of Candida and in the increase in the
incidence of nonalbicans species.15,16 Thus, there is
need for a topical agent that is as effective as systemic agents, well tolerated, administered once daily,
and does not increase the risk of emergence of resistance.

Miconazole has a broad-spectrum antifungal activity against the most frequent Candida observed in OPC,
including C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis.17,18
It is worth noting that no initial resistance has been
described, and resistance in chronically treated
patients rarely is reported. Topical miconazole is
used infrequently in patients with OPC because of
the multiple daily dosing and bad taste.19 A new, 50mg miconazole mucoadhesive buccal tablet (MBT)
Lauriad reportedly demonstrated the ability to deliver high and prolonged salivary miconazole concentrations without significant plasma exposure.20
Salivary concentrations were >10 times higher than
those of miconazole gel and persisted over the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (1 lg/mL) for
>12 hours after a single 50-mg gingival application.
Moreover, the reduction in drug dose precluded the
risk of systemic exposure, drug-drug interactions, and
liver toxicity. Finally, 17 of 18 volunteers preferred the
gingival mucoadhesive tablet, which was well
tolerated.21
The objective of the current clinical trial was to
comparing the clinical efficacy of a once-daily
administration of miconazole (Loramyc, BioAlliance
Pharma, Paris, France) 50-mg MBT with that of
miconazole oral gel (MOG) administered in 4 equal
daily doses of 125 mg. Both treatments were administered for 14 days to patients with head and neck
cancer who had OPC. MOG was chosen as a comparator at the request of drug agencies to evaluate the
intrinsic effects of this new targeted formulation and
to control for drug variability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Men and women aged >18 years who underwent
radiation therapy for head and neck cancer with clinical signs and symptoms of OPC who had either a
first episode or a recurrence of OPC were eligible for
the study. OPC had to be confirmed by direct mycologic examination and positive fungal culture with
>100 colonies.
Patients were excluded if they had systemic or
disseminated candidiasis outside the oropharyngeal
cavity, if they had received systemic antifungal treatment within the last 14 days, if they were receiving

206

concomitant treatments that could interfere with
miconazole (anticoagulants, hypoglycemic sulfonylureas), if they had liver failure (defined as aspartate
and/or alanine transferase levels >5 times the upper
limit of the normal values and/or reduced prothrombin time [<80%]), or if they were unable to understand or follow the study procedures. Exclusion
criteria also included poor general condition (an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status >2), recent participation in another trial, and
women of childbearing age with no acceptable contraception methods or treatment.
The study was approved by independent ethics
committees and was performed in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice, Guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use and the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients signed a written informed-consent form
before participation in the study.
Eligible patients were randomized to receive either miconazole Lauriad 50-mg MBT (Loramyc,
BioAlliance Pharma) once daily or MOG 500 mg
(Daktarin; Janssen-Cilag) daily in 4 125-mg divided
doses for 14 days. Patients were instructed to apply
the MBT on the gum once daily in the morning.
MOG was to be kept in the mouth as long as possible before swallowing.

Study Procedures
Baseline assessments were performed on Day 1, efficacy assessments were conducted on Days 7 and 14,
and recurrence assessments were conducted on Days
30 and 60. At all visits, the Murray Scoring Scale was
used to evaluate the extent of the oral candidiasis
lesions (0, none; 1, single localized; 2, multiple localized; 3, extensive or confluent). Candidiasis symptoms (odynophagia, burning/soreness) were evaluated
by using a rating scale from 0 to 3 in which 0 indicated the absence of symptoms, 1 indicated mild
symptoms, 2 indicated moderate symptoms, and 3
indicated severe symptoms. Direct microscopic examination of yeasts and fungal cultures were undertaken at Days 0 and 14, at Day 7 in patients who had
a complete clinical response, and during follow-up in
the event of recurrence. The duration of tablet adhesion and local safety were self-evaluated daily by
questionnaire for patients who were randomized to
the MBT group. At each visit, any clinical adverse
event that was reported spontaneously by patients
and/or observed by investigators or any biologic
adverse events were reported and graded according
to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity
Criteria.

Endpoints
The primary endpoint was the success rate at Day
14, which was defined as complete or partial clinical
response. A complete clinical response was defined
as the complete disappearance of OPC lesions, and a
partial clinical response was defined as improvement
by 2 points of the Murray Scoring Scale compared
with the score at baseline. All other responses were
considered failures. An amendment introduced a
blind assessment of the primary criterion performed
in each investigational center by an independent
healthcare member who was unaware of the study
drug allocated to each patient. It was implemented
after the inclusion of 59 patients.
Secondary endpoints were the success rate at
Day 7, the percentage of complete responses at Days
7 and 14, the percentage of clinical cures (sign- and
symptom-free patients), improvement in candidiasis
symptoms (defined as a decrease of 1 point in the
score coding for the severity of symptoms compared
with the score at baseline), the percentage of mycologic cures (defined as complete eradication of
Candida or <10 colonies per plate), the recurrence
rate in responders, and the progression rate in nonresponders. The time to recurrence was calculated.
Finally, biologic, local, and general safety was compared between treatments.
Statistical analyses were performed in modified
intent-to-treat (mITT) (all randomized patients who
received at least 1 treatment dose and had 1 efficacy
evaluation after randomization) and per-protocol
populations. Safety analyses included all patients
who received at least 1 dose of study medication.
A noninferiority statistical approach was used; a
clinical margin of 20% was chosen taking into
account that severe local oral conditions could
impede the correct adhesion of MBT to the gum. In
the absence of data on the efficacy of MOG in
patients with head and neck cancer who underwent
radiation therapy, a 50% efficacy rate was assumed.
A sample size of 103 patients per treatment arm was
required to obtain a 90% power to demonstrate the
noninferiority of MBT to MOG (a level, 5%; b level,
20%; both 1-sided). To compensate for a potential
10% dropout rate and for the 59 patients who were
included before implementation of the abovementioned amendment, the number of patients to be
enrolled was increased to 286. Continuous data
were compared using either the Student t test or
the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. For binary
data, the 2 treatment groups were compared using
the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test. The
Mantel-Haenszel test was used to evaluate ordinal
quantitative data.

RESULTS
In total, 306 patients were enrolled in the study from
May 2002 to June 2004; 282 patients (141 per treatment group) were included in the mITT population,
and 294 patients (147 per treatment group) were
included in the safety population (Fig. 1). The
baseline characteristics for the mITT population are
presented Table 1. Patient demographics, characteristics, and disease histories were not different
between the 2 treatment groups. However, the percentage of patients with reduced or absent salivary
secretion and with multiple or confluent oral
lesions were marginally higher in the MBT group
(21% and 71%, respectively) compared with the percentages observed in the MOG group (13% and 58%,
respectively; P 5 .09 and P 5 .06, respectively). Pretreatment samples determined that C. albicans was
the only causative organism in 63% of patients,
whereas C. nonalbicans was the only species in 25% of
patients.
After 14 days of treatment, the success rate in
the MBT group was statistically not inferior to
(P < .0001) or and numerically higher than the success rate in the MOG group (56% vs 49%, respectively;
P < .0001). The noninferiority margin was 4.8%. Per
protocol, and sensitivity analyses confirmed the
robustness of data. Complete responders accounted
for almost all of the success rate (Table 2).

Because patients were distributed unevenly in
terms of the extent of lesions and severely impaired
salivary secretions, a complementary statistical analysis adjusting for these parameters was performed.
The results from that analysis indicated a strong
trend toward superiority in favor of MBT (P 5 .13)
(Table 3). After adjustment, the success rate at Day
14 in patients who had multiple lesions was 58.7% in
the MBT group versus 37.5% in the MOG group (57%
increase; P 5 .013). Likewise, in patients without
impaired saliva secretion at the time of their inclusion, the success rate at Day 14 was 100% in the
MBT group versus 40% in the MOG group (150%
increase; P 5 .034) (Table 3). Clinical success at Day
7 was achieved in 14% of the MBT group and in 20%
of the MOG group (noninferiority; P 5 .0016; 95%
confidence interval, 22.8% to 15.2%).
Clinical symptoms improved in 70.3% and 76.5%
of patients in the MBT and MOG groups, respectively
(P value nonsignificant [NS]). Among patients who
had burning/soreness at inclusion, 63.5% and 56%
were symptom-free in the MBT and MOG groups,
respectively (P value NS), and 57.6% and 50% of
patients were odynophagia-free, respectively, among
those who reported odynophagia at baseline (P value
NS). Likewise, erythema and inflammation disappeared in >50% of patients in both groups, and
mucositis disappeared in 43.6% of patients in the

MBT group (vs 57.6% in the MOG group; P value
NS). At the end of treatment, 39.1% of patients in
both treatment groups were free of signs and symptoms (clinical cure; P value NS).

Fourteen days after the end of treatment, recurrence occurred in 19% and 12.5% of complete
responders in the MBT and MOG groups, respectively. Forty-five days after the end of treatment, the
recurrence rates were 21.5% and 17%, respectively.
On average, the time to recurrence was 18.75 days
and 20.60 days posttreatment for the MBT and MOG
groups, respectively. There was no clinical extension
of oral lesion to the esophagus and no systemic
spread in either group. The progression rate in nonresponders at Day 60 was low: 4.3% in the MBT
group versus 3.9% in the MOG group.
Despite critical local conditions, MBT adhesion
was very good; 92.2% and 61.6% of tablets adhered
for 6 hours and 12 hours, respectively. Approximately 50% of tablets still adhered to the gum at
bedtime. Only 9 (6%) of patients applied <11 tablets
during the study period and were considered noncompliant. Only 6% of tablets were swallowed without occurrence of adverse events. Adhesion for >6
hours was slightly less frequent in the first 2 days of
treatment (85% of patients) than later (92-100% of
patients).
In total, 130 adverse events (69 events in the
MBT group and 61 events in the MOG group) were
reported spontaneously. There were no differences in
safety profile between the MBT and MOG groups.
The incidence of adverse events (29.3% vs 27.2%,
respectively) was similar between the 2 treatment
groups. There were no age or sex effects in either
treatment group, and no differences were observed
in the severity of adverse events between groups
(data not shown). Fewer serious adverse events were
reported in the MBT group (0.7% vs 4.7% in the
MOG group).
Adverse events that occurred with an incidence
>1% are listed in Table 4. Nausea and vomiting were
associated more frequently with MOG, and dysgeusia
was associated more frequently with MBT. However,
this latter event was reported exclusively in only 1
investigational center and likely was related to radiation therapy.
Local tolerability, which was assessed only in the
MBT group using a self-administered questionnaire,
was satisfactory. Overall discomfort (5.3%), burning
(7.2%), bad taste (7.2%), and pain (1.8%) were
reported in few patients. Patients did not report any
adverse events specifically related to the MBT formulation or to the duration of tablet adhesion to the
gum.
A significant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was reported in 3 patients in the MOG
group. There were no reports increased in ALT in the
MBT group.

DISCUSSION
Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer substantially affects the condition of the oral cavity, including mucositis, deteriorated functioning of salivary
glands, and risk of fungal infection. These potentially
may cause pain while eating, possibly leading to a
temporary suspension of radiation therapy for up to
15 days.22 These effects are aggravated if radiation
therapy is combined with chemotherapy.22 OPC is
the most frequent infection in these patients.13 The
incidence of Candida colonization reaches 93%; and
the incidence of oral candidiasis varies widely from
17% to >29% Candida colonization in patients with
head and neck cancer, peaks 6 months after radiation therapy, and slowly declines to above normal
values after 18 months.23 Patients, especially when
they suffer from associated radiation-induced mucositis, remain at risk of OPC during this period. The
occurrence of OPC increases the risk of treatment-

oral antifungal agents for the treatment of OPC.
Indeed, in this trial, miconazole 50 mg MBT administered once daily provided clinical success (complete
or partial disappearance of oral lesions) in >55% of
patients with head and neck cancer, and a strong
trend toward superiority over miconazole 500 mg gel
(MOG) administered in 4 divided doses was observed
when the statistical analysis was adjusted for baseline salivary secretions and extent of candidiasis
lesions, factors that were unbalanced between the
groups at baseline particularly in this population
with multiple lesions. Clinical cure was observed in
approximately 40% of patients. These results can be
compared with those reported with oral fluconazole
administered at a dose of 50 mg per day for 14 days,
which induced a clinical response in 53% of patients,
although a clinical cure was obtained in only 21% of
patients.24
In patients with xerostomia, the efficacy of oral
antifungal agents is likely to be low, because they are
not excreted into saliva. Topical treatments are suited
better for treating such patients. Our data indicated
that, even if success rates with MBT were lower in
these patients (46.7%) than in patients who had normal (100%) or reduced salivary secretion (56.2%), they
remained clinically meaningful and largely superior to
the rates observed with MOG (31.6%). This suggests
that miconazole is released adequately from MBT and
diffuses correctly in the xerostomic mouth.
There was no relation in the current study
between clinical success or clinical cure and mycologic cure. This was expected, because Candida is a
commensal host of oral mucosa, and most patients
who are treated for head and neck cancer continue
to harbor Candida long after they achieve a clinical
cure. In fact, mycologic eradication is not an objective of antifungal treatment and rarely is achieved,
even with systemic agents, with which 40% to 70%
eradication rates were observed, depending on the
population treated and the treatment received.25
Recurrence rates after antifungal treatment have
not been reported in patients who have head and
neck cancer with OPC. The rates observed with both
MBT and MOG were low and were maintained for at
least 60 days. The majority of recurrences occurred
within 1 month after the end of treatment. No predictive factors for recurrences have been identified.
There was no correlation between recurrence and
the persistence of Candida at the end of treatment.
Furthermore, no correlations have been identified
between treatment failure or recurrence and the
occurrence of new Candida species or the emergence of resistant yeasts at the end of the treatment
period.

The efficacy of MBT was achieved with a 10-fold
lower miconazole dose than that of the topical gel
(50 mg vs 500 mg) using a once-daily administration
schedule instead of a 4-times-daily administration.
Rapid, high, and sustained salivary concentrations
were obtained with mucoadhesive tablets.20 Along
with good compliance, the MBT may contribute to a
decreased risk of emergence or selection of resistant
strains.
Overall, miconazole 50 mg MBT was tolerated
well, and the nature and severity of the adverse
events with MBT were in accordance with the pharmacologic properties of miconazole. There were no
differences in the safety profile between miconazole
MBT and gel formulations. Miconazole MBT did not
induce increases in liver enzymes that may be deleterious in patients who are receiving multiple toxic
treatments for their cancer and are at risk of liver
metastases.
Miconazole MBT displayed excellent local tolerability: Only a small proportion of patients reported
local adverse events, and the acceptability of this
new treatment was good, as demonstrated by the
very high compliance rate for a topical treatment.
Tablet adhesion to the mucous membrane was excellent, with >90% and >60% of tablets adhering to the
gum for at least 6 hours and 12 hours, respectively.
Effective adhesion ensures a continuous release of
miconazole and may contribute to the very good
patient compliance and favorable efficacy rate
obtained in patients with head and neck cancer.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to adequately evaluate compliance in the MOG group to verify this
assumption.
Lefebvre et al. reported that fluconazole suspension was a useful and well suited therapeutic alternative in patients who were treated for head and neck
cancer, because it is administered once daily, well
absorbed, and easy to swallow.24 MBT shares the
same advantages and may be suited even better for
these patients, because it provides an efficacy rate
similar to that reported with oral agents, and it may
prevent the emergence of resistant strains that have
been described with fluconazole.26,27 Therefore, in
clinical practice, miconazole MBT may facilitate compliance with Infectious Diseases Society of America
recommendations to treat OPC with topical agents.
