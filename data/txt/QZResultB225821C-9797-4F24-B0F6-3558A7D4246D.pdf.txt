ABSTRACT
Therapeutic resistance to trastuzumab caused by dysregulation of long noncoding
RNAs (lncRNAs) is a major obstacle to clinical management of HER2-positive
breast cancer. To investigate which lncRNAs contribute to trastuzumab resistance,
we screened a microarray of lncRNAs involved in the malignant phenotype of
trastuzumab-resistant SKBR-3/Tr cells. Expression of the lncRNA GAS5 was decreased
in SKBR-3/Tr cells and in breast cancer tissue from trastuzumab-treated patients.
Inhibition of GAS5 promoted SKBR-3 cell proliferation, and GAS5 knockdown partially
reversed lapatinib-induced inhibition of SKBR-3/Tr cell proliferation. GAS5 suppresses
cancer proliferation by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-21, leading to the
de-repression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN), the endogenous target
of miR-21. Moreover, mTOR activation associated with reduced GAS5 expression was
required to suppress PTEN. This work identifies GAS5 as a novel prognostic marker
and candidate drug target for HER2-positive breast cancer.

is a potent and reversible inhibitor of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) and the ErbB2 receptor
[9]. In the present study, we aim to determine the potential
role of lncRNA regulation in enhanced tumor suppression
activity of lapatinib in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer
cells.

INTRODUCTION
HER2 overexpression and amplification are detected
in 15%–20% of breast cancers and correlate with poor
prognosis and short survival [1, 2]. Anti-human HER2
antibody therapy using trastuzumab is used to treat
HER2-positive, early-stage, and metastatic breast cancers
but less than 35% of patients initially respond [3, 4]. The
remainder are inherently resistant or acquire resistance
during disease progression. Trastuzumab resistance
remains an obstacle for treatment of these patients [5–7].
A recently discovered mechanism of trastuzumab
resistance is the dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs). Previous studies showed that lnc-ATB
promotes trastuzumab resistance and invasion–metastasis
cascade in breast cancer by competitively binding to miR200c, thereby upregulating ZEB1 [8].
Novel agents targeting different signaling pathways
could overcome the limitations of trastuzumab. Lapatinib

RESULTS
GAS5 is downregulated in SKBR-3/Tr cells and
trastuzumab-treated breast cancer tissues
Microarray analysis with replicates for 10,802
lncRNAs was performed to examine differences in
lncRNA expression in SKBR-3 and SKBR-3/Tr cells;
the signal was normalized, averaged, and plotted. 357
lncRNAs were down-regulated and 472 were up-regulated
using a twofold change as the split point (Figures 1a, 1b).

The result agrees with a previously study that showed
increased lnc-ATB [8]. GAS5 was among the top 15
down-regulated lncRNAs. The expression of GAS5 was
confirmed by real-time PCR monitoring and normalization
to 18s (Figure 1c). The results of Real-time PCR
analysis showed that GAS5 expression was significantly
downregulated in trastuzumab-resistant patients with
breast cancer (Figure 1d).

Low expression levels of GAS5 correlated with
advanced TNM stage and histological grading (P < 0.05,
Figures 2c and 2d). Kaplan–Meier survival estimates
showed that low GAS5 expression in breast cancer tissues
was associated with poor disease free survival (DFS) (P =
0.015, log-rank test) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.048,
log-rank test) (Figure 2e and 2f).

Downregulation of GAS5 is associated with poor
prognosis of human breast cancer

GAS5 knockdown promotes SKBR-3 cell
tumorigenesis and metastatic potential in vitro
and in vivo

We determined GAS5 expression in 86 pairs of
breast cancer tissues and corresponding non-tumor tissues
by qRT-PCR analysis. Transcript levels of GAS5 were
decreased in most breast cancer tissues (Figure 2a). GAS5
expression was downregulated in all HER2-positive
breast cancer specimens (n = 20) relative to pair-matched
noncancerous tissues (Figure 2b).

We transfected si-GAS5 into SKBR-3 breast cancer
cells; GAS5 knockdown increased cell proliferation
(Figure 3a). Colony formation assays revealed that siGAS5 transfected SKBR-3 cells formed more colonies
than control cells (Figure 3b). Immunostaining results
revealed that the number of Ki-67-positive cells increased
in GAS5 knockdown cells compared to si-Scramble cells

(Figure 3c). Western blot analysis revealed that Ki-67
expression was higher in the si-GAS5 group (Figure 3d).
In order to confirm the effect of GAS5 in vivo, we
subcutaneously inoculated the SKBR-3 cells transfected
with si-GAS5 or si-Scramble into nude mice. Consistent
with in vitro results, tumors in the si-GAS5 group grew
more quickly up to 16 days after the injection than in the
control group (Figure 3e). The average size of tumors

derived from GAS5 knockdown cells increased by 66.1%
(Figure 3f). Furthermore, immunostaining revealed that
the number of Ki-67-positive cells were higher in tumors
from GAS5 knockdown cells (Figure 3g). Western blot
analysis further revealed that Ki-67 expression was higher
in these tumors (Figure 3h).
To determine the role of GAS5 in tumor metastasis
in vivo, we injected 2.5 × 106 si-GAS5 stably transfected

weeks after injection, the mice were euthanized. Mice
that received si-GAS5 cells had more tumors on the
lung surface than those administered with the control
cell si-Scramble Vector (Figure 3i). Histological analysis
confirmed the presence of metastatic tumors in the
lungs of these mice (Figure 3i). Furthermore, there were
more Ki-67-positive cells in tumors formed from GAS5
knockdown tissues (Figure 3i).

cells after the transfection (Figure 4c).

GAS5 knockdown downregulates PTEN
expression in breast cancer
PTEN is a key modulator of trastuzumab sensitivity
in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. qPCR and Western
blot showed PTEN was downregulated in SKBR-3/Tr cells
(Figures 4d and 4e). Lapatinib increased PTEN mRNA
and protein in SKBR-3/Tr cells (Figures 4d and 4e). We
transfected si-GAS5 into SKBR-3 cells and confirmed
transfection by qPCR. GAS5 knockdown reduced the
mRNA and protein expression levels of PTEN. Knockdown
of GAS5 downregulated lapatinib-induced expression of
PTEN in SKBR-3/Tr cells (Figures 4d and 4e).

Lapatinib alleviates trastuzumab resistance by
up-regulation of GAS5
Lapatinib blocked the proliferation of SKBR-3/Tr
cells and upregulated GAS5 (Figures 4a and 4b). MTT
assays showed that knockdown of GAS5 reversed growth

GAS5 competitively binds endogenous miR-21
targeting PTEN

(Figure 4i). Our data suggest GAS5 increases PTEN levels
by competitively binding to miR-21.

We stably overexpressed si-miR-21 or si-Scramble
in SKBR-3 cells. The inhibition of GAS5 decreased PTEN
mRNA and protein levels, and the inhibition of GAS5 on
PTEN was abolished by depletion of miR-21 (Figures
4f and 4g). The expression levels of GAS5 and PTEN
mRNA in the same set of 86 breast cancer tissues were
measured (Figure 4h). GAS5 transcript level correlated
with PTEN mRNA level. The level of PTEN protein
expression, determined by immunohistochemistry, was
significantly higher in the GAS5 high-expression group
compared with that in the GAS5 low-expression group

Lapatinib upregulates GAS5 in trastuzumabresistant breast cancer through mTOR pathway
To analyze the signaling pathways downstream
of EGFR involved in regulating GAS5, we performed
Western blot assays on lapatinib-treated SKBR-3/Tr
cells. p-Akt and p-mTOR protein levels were reduced
in lapatinib-treated cells relative to controls (Figure 5a),
while Akt and mTOR were minimally changed. This
finding indicates that lapatinib may inhibit the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway. Additionally, inhibition of

resistant cells. a. Lapatinib inhibits proliferation of SKBR-3/Tr cells. b. Relative expression of GAS5 in SKBR-3/Tr cells treated with

mTOR by rapamycin increases the expression of GAS5
(Figure 5b). In summary, GAS5, regulated by mTOR
pathway, serves as a ceRNA of miR-21 to regulate PTEN
in the development of breast cancer trastuzumab resistance
(Figure 5c).

by genome-wide microarray analysis; reduced GAS5
expression was verified by qPCR. GAS5 knockdown
induced SKBR-3 cell viability and strengthened Ki-67
expression.
Knockdown of GAS5 promoted cell proliferation
and tumor growth in vivo. GAS5 expression was markedly
decreased in the tumor tissues relative to surrounding noncancerous tissue. Low GAS5 expression in breast cancer
patients correlated with histological grading and advanced
TNM stage. These findings indicate that GAS5 is reduced
by trastuzumab and may act as a tumor suppressive gene
regulator in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.
To overcome the limitations of trastuzumab, new
agents targeting different signaling pathways are urgently
needed. The small-molecule lapatinib is classified
as a dual inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2, preventing
downstream signaling events [9, 16]. We confirmed that
lapatinib suppresses the proliferation of SKBR-3/Tr cells
by upregulation of PTEN and GAS5. Lapatinib inhibition
of cell growth was impaired by knockdown of GAS5 with
downregulation of PTEN in this study. These findings
suggest that lapatinib partially inhibits the proliferation
of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells through the
upregulation of PTEN and GAS5. Multiple signaling
pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, mitogen-activated
protein kinase, and Wnt/β-catenin, are activated by EGFR
to enhance proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis
of cancer cells [17]. We demonstrate that inhibiting mTOR
signaling by rapamycin reversed the GAS5-induced
upregulation of PTEN.

DISCUSSION
This study sought to unravel the molecular
mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance. Beyond the wellknown HER2 and EGFR, other pathways, such as HER3
or insulin-like growth factor receptor, activation of PI3K/
Akt/mTOR, overexpression of c-MET or up-regulation
of Src activity, and loss of PTEN or MUC4, are involved
[12, 13].
Recent studies link lncRNAs to the development
of chemoresistance. For example, a differentially
expressed lncRNA ARA was validated in MCF-7/ADR
and HepG2/ADR cells [14]. LncRNA-UCA1 increases
cisplatin resistance during bladder cancer chemotherapy
by increasing the expression of Wnt6 and thus
represents a potential target to overcome bladder cancer
chemoresistance [15]. lncRNA ATB is among the most
upregulated lncRNAs in trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells and in the tissues of trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer patients [8].
Given their important regulatory effects on cancer
progression, we infer that a relationship exists between
lncRNAs and trastuzumab resistance. GAS5 was among
the 15 most downregulated lncRNAs in SKBR-3/Tr cells

development and progression of various human tumors. EGFR strongly activates another kinase, Akt, via a lipid kinase, PI3K, leading to
activation of mTOR. Activation of mTOR signaling blocks GAS5, which works as a ceRNA for miR-21 and decreases the expression of
PTEN. Downregulation of PTEN favors cancer cells growth and migration. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01.

Given the important regulatory effects of PTEN
and GAS5 on trastuzumab resistance, we infer that a
relationship exists between PTEN and GAS5. Several
RNA transcripts, including lncRNAs, have been identified
as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), such as
CCAT1 and H19 [18, 19]. Previous studies showed that
GAS5 functions as a ceRNA for miR-21, and that miR21 promoted tumor proliferation and invasion by targeting
PTEN [20]. As a tumor suppressor, GAS5 enhances
PTEN expression by inhibiting miR-103 expression in
endometrial cancer [21]. Here, we found GAS5 functions
as a molecular sponge for miR-21, increasing PTEN
expression. The GAS5 transcript level was correlated
with PTEN mRNA level and protein level in breast cancer
tissues.
From a broader perspective, the identification
of GAS5 as an important prognostic factor for breast
patients warrants further investigation of its functional
roles. This study may provide a strategy and facilitate
the development of GAS5 directed diagnostics and
therapeutics against trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.

were cloned into the pENTER/U6 vector. The U6
promoter and interference fragment were amplified by
PCR and subcloned into the SpeI site of pCDH-CMVMCS-EF1-Puro vectors (System Biosciences, CA,
USA). Lentiviruses were produced by transfecting HEK
293T with a 3-plasmid system according to the manual’s
instructions.

Microarray analysis
Total RNA was extracted from the treated SKBR3 and SKBR-3/Tr cells. lncRNAs in the RNA samples

(Kangchen Bio-tech, Shanghai, China) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantile normalization and
data processing were performed using the GeneSpring

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunohistochemistry and scoring system

Tissue samples and clinical data collection

The resected specimens were paraffin embedded and
expression of PTEN and ki-67 were detected using labeled
streptavidin biotin. The intensity of positive staining was
determined by integrated optical density. The results were
graded according to the intensity (0-negative, 1-weak,
2-moderate, and 3-strong) and percentage of positive
cells [0, 1 (1–24%), 2 (25–49%), 3 (50–74%), and 4 (75–
100%)], with discrepancies resolved by consensus. The
grades were multiplied to determine a score.

Human breast cancer specimens (n = 86) were
obtained from the Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical
University. Clinicopathological data, including patient
age and sex, tumor size, lymphatic invasion, lymph node
metastasis, distant metastasis, pathological stages, and
clinical stage, were obtained from the patient database.
Normal breast tissues were collected from the same
patients at a site distant from the primary tumor as control
samples. This study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of Weifang Medical University. Written
informed consent was obtained from each patient.

MTT assay and colony formation assay
Cell proliferation was tested with the tetrazolium
salt 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide reagent (MTT, Sigma) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 2 × 103 cells were
plated in each well of the 96-well plates with 200 μL
medium. Prior to analysis, 20 μL of MTT (2.5 mg/
mL) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. The
medium was then removed, and the cells were solubilized
in 150 μL of dimethylsulfoxide for colorimetric analysis
(wavelength, 490 nm) on a microplate spectrophotometer.
Growth values were calculated as follows: (OD treated
cells/OD untreated cells) × 100. The experiments were
performed in triplicate, and cell proliferation curves were
plotted using the absorbance at each time point.
For colony formation assay, 100 cells were plated
into six-well plates and incubated in RPMI 1640 with 10%
FBS at 37°C. After 7 days, the cells were fixed and stained
with 0.1% crystal violet. The number of colonies was
counted. The experiments were performed in triplicates
and repeated three times.

Cell culture, chemical, and plasmids
The HER2 overexpressing human breast cancer
cell line SKBR-3 was purchased from the Chinese
Type Culture Collection, Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China) and verified by mycoplasma and cell
vitality detection. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, MA, USA) at 37°C
in a humidified air atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Trastuzumab (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was dissolved
in sterile water. Trastuzumab-resistant SKBR-3/Tr cells
were obtained by continuous culture with 5 mg/mL
trastuzumab for 6 months as previously reported [8, 10],
and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 250 μg/
mL trastuzumab. Lapatinib was purchased from Selleck
Chemicals. SKBR-3 cells or SKBR-3/Tr cells were

of 1 × 108 cells/mL. 100 μL of the suspended cells were
subcutaneously injected into a single side of the posterior
flank of each mouse. Tumor growth was examined
every 3 days, and tumor volumes were calculated using
the equation V = 0.5 × D × d2 (where V, volume; D,
longitudinal diameter; d, latitudinal diameter) [11]. 15 days
post-injection, mice were euthanized, and subcutaneous
growth of each tumor was examined.
