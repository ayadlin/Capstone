Imiquimod directly inhibits Hedgehog signalling by stimulating
adenosine receptor/protein kinase A-mediated GLI
phosphorylation
F Wolff1, A Loipetzberger1, W Gruber1, H Esterbauer2, F Aberger1 and AM Frischauf1
Imiquimod (IMQ), a nucleoside analogue of the imidazoquinoline family, is used in the topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma
(BCC) and other skin diseases. It is reported to be a TLR7 and TLR8 agonist and, as such, initiates a Th1 immune response by
activating sentinel cells in the vicinity of the tumour. BCC is a hedgehog (HH)-driven malignancy with oncogenic glioma-associated
oncogene (GLI) signalling activated in a ligand-independent manner. Here we show that IMQ can also directly repress HH signalling
by negatively modulating GLI activity in BCC and medulloblastoma cells. Further, we provide evidence that the repressive effect of
IMQ on HH signalling is not dependent on TLR/MYD88 signalling. Our results suggest a mechanism for IMQ engaging adenosine
receptors (ADORAs) to control GLI signalling. Pharmacological activation of ADORA with either an ADORA agonist or IMQ resulted in
a protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated GLI phosphorylation and reduction in GLI activator levels. The activation of PKA and HH pathway
target gene downregulation in response to IMQ were abrogated by ADORA inhibition. Furthermore, activated Smoothened
signalling, which positively signals to GLI transcription factors, could be effectively counteracted by IMQ. These results reveal a
previously unknown mode of action of IMQ in the treatment of BCC and also suggest a role for ADORAs in the regulation of
oncogenic HH signalling.

INTRODUCTION
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are slowly growing, locally invasive
tumours of the skin, which arise from the basal layer of the
epidermis and from hair follicles.1 BCC is caused by an aberrant
activation of the Hedgehog (HH)/glioma-associated oncogene
(GLI) signalling pathway, most frequently in response to genetic
inactivation of the HH/GLI repressor Patched, or more rarely by
genetic activation of the essential pathway effector Smoothened
(SMO).2,3 It comprises 80% of non-melanoma skin cancers.4 BCC
presents as several distinct subtypes, is the most common tumour
in populations of European ancestry and usually occurs on sunexposed areas.5 The most common therapy involves surgical
excision of the tumour. This can, however, be disﬁguring, and
non-surgical approaches are being implemented. Furthermore,
BCC can become quite large and intractable, but rarely
metastasizes (far less than 1% of cases). These tumours require
non-surgical treatment. For treatment of malignant BCC, GDC0449 (Vismodegib), an inhibitor of the HH signal transducer
SMO, has just recently been approved, although resistance
frequently evolves and severe side effects, such as muscle
cramps and weight loss, possibly via the activation of noncanonical SMO signalling,6 can result in signiﬁcant drop-out rates
of up to 50%.7–10
Small superﬁcial BCCs are topically treated with Imiquimod
(IMQ) (Figure 1a),11,12 a synthetic nucleoside analogue of the
imidazoquinoline family. The mode of action is described as
immune modifying, primarily targeting sentinel cells of the skin.

IMQ initiates TLR7 and TLR8 signalling, which leads to the
secretion of Th1 cytokines. This inﬂammatory milieu activates
cytotoxic functions of CD8 þ cells to attack the tumour.13,14 IMQ
has also been reported to induce apoptosis.15 Furthermore, it
can bind to adenosine receptors (ADORAs), a group of
G-protein-coupled receptors.16 ADORAs are widely expressed
throughout the body. They are involved in a variety of
physiological processes, such as proliferation, cell death and
stress signalling,17 and the extracellular concentration of the
natural ligand, adenosine, is elevated in pathological situations,
such as solid tumours.18,19 ADORAs are expressed in a range
of tumours and inﬂuence immunesurveillance processes.20
Of note, in Drosophila, adenosine has been linked to the
regulation of Hh signalling by triggering the formation of the
truncated transcriptional repressor form of Cubitus interruptus,
the ﬂy homologue of vertebrate GLI proteins, in haematopoietic
precursor cells.21 Whether ADORA signalling affects mammalian
HH signalling has not yet been addressed.
The HH signalling pathway is well known for its role in
embryonic development from ﬂies to vertebrates.22 In the adult
organism, it is involved in the regulation of stem cell maintenance
and tissue homeostasis.23,24
Several components of the HH pathway, including the GLIs,
have been shown to localize to the primary cilium, an antenna-like
cellular compartment required for sensing the three HH ligands
(Sonic/Indian/Desert HH) and transforming this extracellular signal
into a coordinated cellular response.25–27 The activation of HH

signalling by Sonic HH or Smoothened agonist (SAG) leads to
ciliary translocation and activation of SMO, a process repressed by
the unliganded HH receptor Patched.28–31
The three zinc ﬁnger transcription factors, GLI1, GLI2 and
GLI3,32–34 mediate HH signalling by controlling the HH target gene
expression in response to pathway activity. GLI1 is a direct
transcriptional target of GLI2 and GLI3, enhancing the overall level
of GLI activator in response to HH signal activation.35–37 GLI1
transcription, therefore, serves as a robust and sensitive functional
read-out for the HH pathway activity. In the absence of HH
signalling, GLI3 and, to some extent, also GLI238–40 act as a
transcriptional repressor.41–44 The GLI2/3 repressor activity is
regulated by proteolytic processing into a C-terminally
truncated transcriptional repressor form, a process involving
phosphorylation of GLI2/3 by protein kinase A (PKA).40,45 Thus,
PKA has a critical role in the negative regulation of GLI activity.
We show here that IMQ negatively regulates HH/GLI signalling
as evidenced by the downregulation of Gli1 mRNA and protein
levels in murine BCC cells and HH-responsive human cancer cells.
IMQ treatment induces phosphorylation of GLI in a PKAdependent manner, thereby promoting the formation of GLI
repressors. Our results provide evidence that the anti-tumour
effect of IMQ can arise not only from the previously reported
initiation of anti-tumour immune responses but also from direct
effects of IMQ on aberrant HH/GLI signalling in the tumour cells.
Our data also suggest that ADORAs participate in modulating
oncogenic HH signalling in mammalian carcinoma cells.

RESULTS
IMQ negatively affects HH signalling in murine BCC cell lines
To test whether IMQ can directly modulate HH signalling in the
absence of any immune effector cells, we treated the Patcheddeﬁcient murine BCC cell line BSZ246 with IMQ and measured its
effect on the Hh pathway activity by quantifying the expression of
two direct Hh target genes, Gli1 and Hhip. IMQ reduced mRNA
expression of both target genes several fold compared with that
of control-treated cells (Figure 1b). We also observed Gli1 protein
downregulation (Figure 1c). Comparable results were obtained
also for ASZ001 cells,46 another Patched-deﬁcient murine BCC cell
line (Supplementary Figure 1). These results show that IMQ exerts
a cell-autonomous negative effect on HH signalling by repressing
the activation of canonical HH/GLI target genes.

Repression of HH/GLI signalling by IMQ is independent of the
TLR7/8–MYD88 signalling axis
As IMQ is known to be a TLR7 and TLR8 agonist,47 we asked
whether these two receptors contribute to the repressive effect of
IMQ on HH/GLI signalling. We ﬁrst measured the expression levels
of the two Tlrs and their common signal transducer Myd88 in the
two murine BCC cell lines (BSZ2 and ASZ001) by real-time PCR
ampliﬁcation. As shown in Figure 2a, Tlr7 and Tlr8 are expressed at
very low levels, if at all, in these cell lines compared with that in
murine splenocytes known to express physiological levels of Tlr7/8.
This is in line with the lack of TLR7/8 in other epidermal cells and
cell lines, such as human HaCaT and foreskin keratinocytes.48,49
Signalling via TLRs involves MYD88, an essential effector protein in
the TLR signalling cascade.50 To address a possible contribution of
TLR/MYD88 signalling to IMQ-mediated repression of Hh signalling,
we ﬁrst measured the expression of Myd88 at the RNA and protein
levels. As shown in Figures 2a and b, Myd88 is expressed in the cell
line BSZ2 at moderate levels. To address the functional involvement of Tlr/Myd88 signalling in IMQ-mediated Hh/Gli repression,
we performed stable, lentiviral RNA interference knockdown of
Myd88. Of note, we found that RNA interference directed against
Myd88 did not affect the ability of IMQ to repress Hh/Gli signalling
in BCC cells. As shown in Figures 2b and c, we did not observe any
signiﬁcant difference in IMQ-mediated Gli1 repression between
Myd88-expressing and Myd88-deﬁcient cells. As ﬁrst, Myd88 is
dispensable for IMQ-mediated downregulation of Gli1, and second,
the major known IMQ targets Tlr7/8 are not expressed at
detectable levels, we conclude that IMQ does not repress Hh/Gli
signalling by targeting the Tlr7/8–Myd88 signalling axis in murine
BCC cell lines.

Modulation of ADORA activity contributes to IMQ-induced
suppression of HH signalling by stimulating PKA-mediated GLI
phosphorylation
In addition to binding to TLRs, IMQ has been shown to bind
ADORAs also, thereby affecting adenylate cyclase (AC) and PKA
activity.16 This is of particular interest, as adenosine/ADORA
signalling has recently been identiﬁed as a negative regulator of
HH signalling in ﬂies by the activation of PKA.21 We therefore
asked (i) whether the modulation of ADORA signalling by
agonists/antagonists affects the HH/GLI pathway activity and (ii)
whether IMQ and ADORA agonists are able to induce

PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GLI as mechanisms of the
HH/GLI pathway repression.
To test this, we used a selective ADORA2A agonist (CGS 21680)
and an antagonist (SCH 442416) to pharmacologically target this
receptor. As shown in Figure 3a, the antagonist completely
abrogated the IMQ-mediated downregulation of Gli1 and Hhip
target gene transcription in the murine BCC cell line. We also
monitored the phosphorylation status of GLI2 by using an
inducible GLI2-expressing HaCaT human keratinocyte system.
Here the antagonist reduced the steady-state phosphorylation of
GLI2 and counteracted IMQ-induced GLI2 phosphorylation
(Figures 3b and c). The ADORA2A agonist CGS 21680, on the
contrary, induced steady-state phosphorylation of GLI2 and
further increased IMQ-induced GLI2 phosphorylation (Figures 3b
and c). These data suggest that IMQ modulates GLI transcriptional
activity through ADORAs and subsequent phosphorylation of
GLI2. PKA is a well-known negative regulator of GLI transcriptional
activity. Phosphorylation of GLI2 and GLI3 by PKA primes for
subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3b and CK1, thereby triggering proteolytic processing of GLI to its repressor forms.40,51–53 As
modulation of PKA by IMQ is mediated through ADORAs and by a
direct effect on AC,16 we hypothesized that PKA has a role in IMQmediated repression of HH signalling. Similar to treatment with
the canonical PKA activator Forskolin, IMQ treatment of HaCaT
cells clearly induced phosphorylation of GLI2. Furthermore, the
AGC kinase inhibitor H89 inhibited phosphorylation of GLI2 by
both IMQ and Forskolin (Figure 3d). This is consistent with a
scenario where PKA is activated by IMQ promoting a change in
the phosphorylation status and consequent destabilization of
GLI2. In summary, these data provide evidence that IMQ
negatively modulates GLI protein activity through changes in
ADORA activity with subsequent activation of PKA.
IMQ promotes GLI3 repressor formation and antagonizes HH
signalling in a human medulloblastoma cell line
To test the effect of IMQ on GLI processing in a more physiological
system with an activated endogenous HH signal cascade, we ﬁrst
turned to murine BCC cells (BSZ2). As a read-out for Gli activity, we
monitored the ratio of Gli3 full length to repressor forms by
quantitative western blot analysis.51 As shown in Figure 4a, IMQ
reduced the ratio of full length to repressor in BSZ2 cells.
Compared with cyclopamine, IMQ reduced this ratio somewhat
more slowly. Still, the increase in Gli3 repressor clearly shows the
repressive effect of IMQ on Hh signalling. To further address
whether HH signal inhibition by IMQ is cell type- and speciesOncogene (2013) 5574 – 5581

speciﬁc, or more broadly effective also in human, non-BCC cells,
we analysed the effect of IMQ on inducible HH signalling, GLI
expression and GLI processing, using the HH-responsive human
medulloblastoma cell line (DAOY).54,55 Notably, IMQ very potently
interfered with the activation of GLI1 expression in DAOY cells
treated with SAG (Figure 4b). Consistent with the model that IMQ
blocks HH signalling by promoting PKA-mediated GLI phosphorylation and repressor formation, IMQ effectively re-established the
GLI3 repressor form in SAG-stimulated DAOY cells (Figure 4c).
As manipulations affecting the primary cilium indirectly interfere
with HH signalling, we also analysed as a control the possible
impact of IMQ on ciliogenesis. As shown in Figure 4d, IMQ-treated
DAOY cells display normal primary cilia, indicating that IMQ does
not affect HH signalling by disturbing the formation of the primary
cilium. Together, these data show that IMQ is able to directly
inhibit HH signalling by inducing PKA-mediated GLI phosphorylation and proteolytic repressor formation.
ADORA2A and ADORA3, but not ADORA1A and 2B, are
overexpressed in human BCC
IMQ is used in the treatment of BCC. On the basis of our results
indicating that ADORAs contribute to IMQ-induced suppression of
HH signalling, we investigated the expression levels of ADORAs in
human BCC. We tested ﬁve human BCC samples for the expression
of the four ADORA mRNAs and compared the expression levels in
the BCC samples with that in three normal skin samples. ADORA3
was expressed at levels similar to that of GLI1, which was
overexpressed in BCCs. ADORA2A mRNA levels are higher in BCC
samples compared with that in the normal skin, whereas ADORA1
and ADORA2B expression in the BCC samples is comparable to
that in the normal skin. This supports the hypothesis that topical
treatment with IMQ of BCCs not only activates an anti-tumour Th1
response but also engages ADORAs on BCC cells, thereby directly
reducing oncogenic HH/GLI signalling.

DISCUSSION
Deregulated HH signalling drives tumourigenesis in a number of
human malignancies, including medulloblastoma and BCC. Metastatic and advanced BCC can be treated using antagonists
targeting the important HH signal transducer SMO.7,56
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of SMO antagonists, such as
Vismodegib, in BCC therapy is limited by tumours developing
resistance or regrowth upon cessation of treatment.57
Furthermore, up to 50% of Vismodegib-treated patients

discontinued treatment due to severe side effects.8,9 Thus,
combined treatment strategies become increasingly important
to enhance efﬁcacy and to circumvent the establishment of
resistance. IMQ is approved for the treatment of superﬁcial BCC.
Although the immune-modulating functions of IMQ have been
investigated extensively,13,58,59 a possible direct effect on HH
signalling in BCC cells has not been addressed so far. As HH
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

signalling is the major pathway driving the development and
maintenance of BCC, we investigated the potential effect of IMQ
on this pathway. Here we show that IMQ promotes PKA activity
followed by HH/GLI target gene downregulation. Importantly, in
contrast to the known immune modulatory effect of IMQ on
sentinel cells, MYD88 is not involved in this mechanism in BCC
cells. In addition, TLR7 and TLR8 are barely expressed in the
tumour cell lines used. Together, this suggests that IMQ represses
HH signalling independently of its immune modulatory functions,
thus unraveling a new therapeutic mode of action of IMQ in BCC.
Furthermore, we also observe the HH-repressive effect of IMQ in a
human medulloblastoma cell line. This shows that IMQ can repress
HH signalling in different tumour types and points to a general
mechanism of IMQ-induced HH repression, which is not restricted
to BCC cells only.
The downregulation of HH signalling is often mediated by PKA,
which is recognized as an important negative regulator of GLI
transcriptional activity. GLI2 and GLI3 proteins harbour several PKA
target sites, which are important for proteasomal processing. Mice,
homozygous for these mutant PKA sites, die in utero and show
increased stability of Gli2 protein, indicating that PKA activity is
essential for proper Gli2 function.40 As GLI2 and GLI3 control the
transcription of GLI1,60,61 we propose that IMQ downregulates HH
signalling and GLI1 expression, respectively, by reducing GLI2/3
activity through PKA activation. IMQ leads to phosphorylation of
GLI2 (Figures 3b–d). Of note, the epitopes detected are
phosphorylated substrates of AGC kinases to which PKA
belongs.62 As the PKA kinase inhibitor H89 blocks GLI2
phosphorylation induced by either IMQ or Forskolin, we
conclude that IMQ, similar to Forskolin, modulates AC and
subsequently PKA activity. These results are supported by data
showing that IMQ can modulate the activity of AC and PKA.16 To
further strengthen the evidence for a role of PKA in IMQ-mediated
repression of HH signalling, we determined the ratio of GLI3 full
length to the repressor form. In two cellular cancer models
(murine BCC and HH-responsive human medulloblastoma cell
lines), IMQ treatment leads to increased formation of GLI3
repressor (Figures 4a and c), in line with enhanced PKA activity.
We suggest that IMQ modulates the activity of the GLI
transcription factors by engaging signalling components of other
pathways. PKA can be controlled by a multitude of signalling
events.63,64 ADORAs are known to engage PKA to mediate
downstream signalling. Recently, it has been shown that the
single Adora of Drosophila facilitates Cubitus interruptus repressor
formation in haematopoietic precursor cells through PKA
activation.21 In CHO cells, Schön et al.16 found that IMQ can
bind ADORAs and modulate AC activity. We observed that all four
ADORA subtypes are expressed in human BCC samples (Figure 5).
Together, these data support the idea that IMQ contributes to
topical therapy by repressing HH/GLI signalling in BCC through
the modulation of ADORA activity. Speciﬁcally, our results suggest
that binding of IMQ to ADORA2A leads to GLI2/3 phosphorylation,
similar to binding of the ADORA2A agonist (CGS 21680). The
quantiﬁcation of GLI2 phosphorylation signals (Figure 3c) reveals
that IMQ induces a phosphorylation signal signiﬁcantly stronger
than the signal induced by the agonist CGS 21680. This may be
due to an additional receptor-independent activation of PKA by
IMQ. A direct modulation of the AC activity and, thus, PKA by IMQ
has been observed by Schön et al.16 in CHO cells lacking any type
of ADORA. However, the ADORA2A antagonist SCH 442416
counteracts the effect of IMQ on GLI2 phosphorylation (Figures
3b and c) and also abrogates the effect of IMQ on target gene
expression in the murine BCC cells (Figure 3a). These data support
the role of IMQ as an ADORA2A agonist as shown in Figures 3b
and c. We can, however, not exclude effects of IMQ on HH
signalling through other ADORAs, as Ki-values of IMQ to ADORA1/
A2A and the A3 receptor are in a similar range16 and we found
other ADORAs to be expressed in the cell lines used in this study

(Supplementary Figure 2a). As human BCCs overexpress ADORA2A
and ADORA3 (Figure 5a), our experiments together strongly
suggest that IMQ acts through ADORAs to repress HH signalling
during BCC therapy.
As our data suggest that IMQ can interfere with HH signalling
downstream of SMO on the level of PKA (Figure 5b), IMQ is of high
interest and might be useful for the treatment of SMO-inhibitorresistant tumours. As a large number of selective ADORA agonists
and antagonists have already been described,65 testing for their
Oncogene (2013) 5574 – 5581

potential to interfere with HH signalling may be a promising
strategy to ﬁnd new molecules, which can aid the development of
combined therapies for HH-driven tumours.
