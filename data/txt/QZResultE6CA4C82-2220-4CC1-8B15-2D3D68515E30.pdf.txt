Abstract
Even though myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, the molecular
alterations that lead to marrow failure have not been well elucidated. We have previously shown that the
myelosuppressive TGF-b pathway is constitutively activated in MDS progenitors. Because there is conflicting
data about upregulation of extracellular TGF-b levels in MDS, we wanted to determine the molecular basis of
TGF-b pathway overactivation and consequent hematopoietic suppression in this disease. We observed that
SMAD7, a negative regulator of TGF-b receptor I (TBRI) kinase, is markedly decreased in a large meta-analysis of
gene expression studies from MDS marrow-derived CD34þ cells. SMAD7 protein was also found to be
significantly decreased in MDS marrow progenitors when examined immunohistochemically in a bone marrow
tissue microarray. Reduced expression of SMAD7 in hematopoietic cells led to increased TGF-b–mediated gene
transcription and enhanced sensitivity to TGF-b–mediated suppressive effects. The increased TGF-b signaling
due to SMAD7 reduction could be effectively inhibited by a novel clinically relevant TBRI (ALK5 kinase) inhibitor,
LY-2157299. LY-2157299 could inhibit TGF-b–mediated SMAD2 activation and hematopoietic suppression in
primary hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, in vivo administration of LY-2157299 ameliorated anemia in a
TGF-b overexpressing transgenic mouse model of bone marrow failure. Most importantly, treatment with LY2157199 stimulated hematopoiesis from primary MDS bone marrow specimens. These studies demonstrate that
reduction in SMAD7 is a novel molecular alteration in MDS that leads to ineffective hematopoiesis by activating
of TGF-b signaling in hematopoietic cells. These studies also illustrate the therapeutic potential of TBRI
inhibitors in MDS. Cancer Res; 71(3); 955–63. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal stem
cell disorders characterized by cytologic dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis (1–3). Although approximately a third
of patients may progress to acute leukemia, refractory
cytopenias are the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with MDS (4). In fact, approximately two
thirds of patients present with lower risk disease characterized by a hypercellular marrows with increased rates of

apoptosis in the progenitor and differentiated cell compartments in the marrow (5–8). Ineffective hematopoiesis arising
from abortive maturation leads to peripheral cytopenias.
Higher grade or more advanced disease categories are
associated with a significant risk of leukemia transformation
with a corresponding lower apoptotic index and higher
percentage of marrow blasts.
Cytokines play important roles in the regulation of normal
hematopoiesis and a balance between the actions of hematopoietic growth factors and myelosuppressive factors is
required for optimal production of different hematopoietic
cell lineages. Excess production of inhibitory cytokines amplifies ineffective hematopoiesis inherent to the MDS clone. TGFb is a myelosuppressive cytokine that has been implicated in
the hematopoietic suppression in MDS. The plasma levels of
TGF-b have been reported to be elevated in some (9–13) but
not all studies (14–17) and are supported by greater TGF-b
immunohistochemical staining in selected studies. In addition
to direct myelosuppressive effects, TGF-b has also been implicated in the autocrine production of other myelosuppressive
cytokines [TNF, IL-6 (interleukin 6), and IFN g] in MDS (18).

Conflicting data may arise from technical limitations of bone
marrow immunohistochemical analyses of a secreted protein
as well as the biological heterogeneity of the disease itself. Thus,
we investigated the role of TGF-b in MDS by direct examination
of receptor signal activation to conclusively determine its role
in the pathogenesis of ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS. We
determined that the SMAD2 is upregulated and overactivated
in MDS bone marrow progenitors, thereby demonstrating
sustained TGF-b signal activation in this disease. We also
determined that inhibition of SMAD2 activation can stimulate
hematopoiesis from primary MDS progenitors, demonstrating
its activation by TGF-b receptor as an important event in
ineffective hematopoiesis. Because there is conflicting data
about upregulation of extracellular TGF-b levels in MDS, we
next sought to determine the molecular basis of TGF-b receptor-I (TBRI) overactivation and subsequent SMAD2 phosphorylation/activation in this disease in the present study. We
observed that SMAD7, a negative regulator of TBRI kinase,
is markedly decreased in MDS and that this leads overactivation of TGF-b signal transduction even in the absence of
increased levels of extracellular TGF-b. Our studies also show
that this can be reversed by a clinically relevant novel inhibitor
of TBRI kinase, LY-2157299, and points to the therapeutic
potency of this approach in MDS.

Materials and Methods
Cells lines and reagents
Human CD34þ cells were isolated from bone marrows of
normal or MDS patients, after obtaining informed consent
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Albert Einstein
College of Medicine. Bone marrow CD34þ cells from various
normal donors were also obtained from AllCells. K562 and HS5 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (American Type
Culture Collection). Erythropoietin and transforming growth
factor-b1 (TGF-b1) were bought from R&D Systems. The
phos-SMAD2 (S465/467) and actin antibodies were from Cell
Signaling Technology, and SMAD2 antibody from Invitrogen.
TBRI inhibitor LY-2157299 was provided by Eli Lilly. LY2157299 was diluted in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide; 20
mmol/L of stock solution) and kept at 20 C until use.

instructions, by using the Nucleofector machine (Amaxa). The
CD34þ cells were thawed and cultured for 2 hours, 2  106
cells were resuspended in 100 mL human CD34þ nucleofection
solution (Amaxa). Samples were transferred into cuvettes and
transfected by using program U08. CD34þ cells were collected,
dispensed in the wells of a 24-well plate containing 1 mL of
prewarmed StemSpan (StemCell Tech), supplemented with
100 ng/mL human FLt-3, SCF, and TPO. The lentiviral transfected CD34þ cells were sorted 24 hours later according to the
green fluorescent protein (GFP) intensity using Moflow (Becton Dickinson). Quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR for SMAD7
expression was done on total RNA from HS-5 and K562 cells
obtained by RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized
with SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase III (Invitrogen). Realtime PCR was performed with SYBR green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and SMAD7 and GAPDH (control) were
simultaneously amplified with specific primers.

Meta-analysis
NCBI's GEO database was searched for gene expression
studies on MDS and normal CD34 cells. A total of 3 MDS data
sets with 89 unique MDS CD34þ studies (20, 21) and 61 normal
CD34þ data sets from 6 studies (20–24) were identified and
downloaded. The data was integrated using unigene IDs.
Studies were done using Affymetrix U133A/B and Plus 2.0
platforms. After interarray quantile normalization, SMAD7
expression was assessed and visually represented as a heat
map using R statistical software. All genes belonging to TGF-b
signaling pathway were examined in the database. To
strengthen the criteria for selecting genes that were differentially expressed in MDS, we only selected genes that were
significantly different in the combined data set as well as in the
2 major MDS cohorts (20, 25) when studied independently.

Cell lysis and immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer as previously described (19). In the experiments in which the effects
of LY-2157299 were studied, DMSO (diluent)-treated cells
were used as control. Immunoblotting was performed as
previously described (19).

Murine experiments
Transgenic mice expressing a fusion gene (Alb/TGF) consisting of modified porcine TGF-b1 cDNA under the control of
the regulatory elements of the mouse albumin gene (26) were
used under animal institute approved protocol. Mice were
given LY-2157299 at a dose of 100 mg/kg/d in NaCMC/SLS/
PVP/antifoam solution by gastric lavage using a curved 14 G
needle. Blood counts were analyzed by Advia machine. Mice
femurs were flushed and bone marrows cells were used for
clonogenic assays.

ShRNA knockdown experiments (only used
nucleofection and not virus)
The human lentiviral shRNAmir (pGIPZ) containing the
hairpin sequence (TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGAGCTGTGTTGCTGTGAATCTTATAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTATAAGATTCACAGCAACACAGCCTGCCTACTGCCTCGGA)
targeting
SMAD7 and the nonsilencing negative control were obtained
from OpenBiosystems. Nucleofection of CD34þ cells or MDS
BM MNCs was performed according to the manufacturer's

TGF-b gene reporter assay
HS-5 cells were plated in 6-well plates 24 hours before
transfection. Cells were transfected in triplicate with SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction
using the reporter plasmid (pGL2-3TP-Lux; ref. 27). pSV-BGal was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. After an
overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with serumfree medium with or without LY-215 as necessary for the
experiment. After 48 hours, cells were treated with 10 ng/mL

Immunohistochemistry on bone marrow tissue
microarray
Tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed from formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsies from
patients with MDS and control patients with anemia whose
bone marrow showed no evidence of neoplasia. The tissue
blocks were procured from Jacobi Hospital after approval by
the Internal Review Board. For each patient, three 0.5-mm
cores were placed in a tissue array using a manual arrayer
(Chemicon International). Sections of the TMAs were cut to 5mm thickness, placed on positively charged slides, and heated
to 60 C for 1 hour. They were then deparaffinized in xylene
and rehydrated with graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Antigen
retrieval was accomplished by microwaving the slides in Dako
Target Retrieval Solution, pH 6.0 (Dako Cytomation, Dako),
and subsequently steaming them in a vegetable steamer for 30
minutes. The slides were stained using a rabbit polyclonal
anti-SMAD7 antibody, provided at 1:200 dilution, followed by
Dako EnVision labeled polymer-HRP anti-rabbit antibody.
Antibody binding was detected using DAB chromogen (Cell
Marque). The slides were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with graded alcohols, cleared with xylene,
and coverslipped using Cytoseal 60 (Thermo Scientific). The
tissue cores were then scored for weak versus strong staining
for SMAD7 by a hematopathologist who was blinded to the
patient identities. Tissue cores that did not contain at least
10% evaluable marrow were excluded from the analysis.

Results
SMAD7 is reduced in bone marrow progenitors in lowgrade MDS
To determine the molecular events that lead to overactivation of TGF-b signaling in MDS, we examined the expression
of genes that are involved in and regulate the TGF-b signaling
cascade in a large number of MDS patient samples. We used a
meta-analysis of publicly available microarray studies in MDS,
comprising a total of 89 unique MDS patient CD34þ gene
expression profiles and 61 normal CD34þ controls. These data
were obtained from published studies (20–25, 29), were integrated using Unigene protein IDs, subjected to interarray
normalization and then used for analysis. This strategy was
shown to be biologically valid strategy for analysis previously

Hematopoietic progenitor cell assays
Hematopoietic progenitor colony formation was determined by clonogenic assays in methylcellulose, as in our
previous studies (19, 28). All participants in the study signed
informed consent, approved by the Institutional Review Board

by us (30). Our analysis of this integrated data set demonstrated that the SMAD7, a negative regulator of the TGF-b
receptor kinase, was the most significantly differentially
expressed gene in MDS and was markedly reduced in most
cases (Fig. 1; mean log2 expression 8.31 in controls vs. 6.32 in
MDS cases; P < 0.0001; Benjamini–Hochberg correction, multiple testing). Subgroup analysis revealed that SMAD7 was
significantly reduced (>2 mean log fold reduction) in both
low- and high-grade MDS samples, though most of the cases
examined belonged to low-risk MDS (83/89 cases). Subgroup
analysis within low-grade MDS revealed lower expression in
cases with and without deletion of chromosome 5q, demonstrating that decrease in SMAD7 is a widespread and significant change in MDS bone marrow stem cells.
To confirm these results, bone marrows of patients with
MDS were assessed for the SMAD7 expression by immunohistochemistry. A TMA containing bone marrow samples
from MDS and control bone marrow biopsies was prepared
to minimize staining variability between individual slides.
MDS bone marrow samples were compared with 24 agematched controls with non-MDS causes of cytopenias (iron
deficiency anemia, chemotherapy-related anemia, hyperplenism, drug-induced marrow suppression, autoimmune anemia,
myelofibrosis and unexplained cytopenias in the absence of
any dysplasia). Significant reduction in SMAD7 was seen in
bone marrow cells of patients with low-risk MDS (75% of
samples had reduced expression vs. 9% of controls; P < 0.05;

proportions test; Fig. 2). Because SMAD7 is ubiquitously
expressed, we also investigated the phenotypes of bone marrow cells that had reduced levels of this protein. Histologic
examination revealed that SMAD7 was reduced in hematopoietic progenitors of all lineages in MDS including erythroid
and myeloid progenitors.
Reduction in SMAD7 can lead to increased sensitivity to
suppressive effects of TGF-b on hematopoiesis
We wanted to study the effect of SMAD7 reduction on TGFb signaling in the hematopoietic system. A lentiviral vector–
based shRNA vector targeting SMAD7 was developed (Fig. 3A)
and was successfully able to inhibit SMAD7 expression when
compared with scrambled control in various hematopoietic
cells. (Fig. 3B). Primary bone marrow–derived CD34þ stem
cells were infected with lentiviruses containing anti-SMAD7
and control shRNA constructs and then GFP selected and
grown in methylcellulose in the presence and absence of
varying amounts of TGF-b. Downregulation of SMAD7 led
to significantly increased sensitivity to TGF-b and very low
amounts of TGF- b was able to significantly inhibit erythroid
colony formation when compared with controls.
Next, we wanted to study the effect of SMAD7 downregulation on TGF-b signaling at the transcriptional level. Luciferase
reporter assays that were dependent on SMAD2 binding
demonstrated that shRNA-mediated downregulation of
SMAD7 led to increase in TGF-b–mediated gene transcription
in bone marrow stromal cells stably transfected with lentiviral
shRNAs, as previous studies have shown that SMAD7 can
inhibit TGF-b receptor I kinase (TBRI) in other model systems,
we hypothesized that reduction in SMAD7 levels leads to
overactivation of TBRI and subsequent downstream signaling
in hematopoietic cells in MDS. To test this, we used a specific
inhibitor of TBRI kinase (LY-2157299) and observed that

inhibition of this kinase abrogates the stimulation of TGF-b
gene transcription that is induced by SMAD7 downregulation.
LY-2157299 is an effective and functionally active
inhibitor of TGF-b signaling in hematopoietic cells
Having demonstrated an important role of SMAD7 reduction and subsequent TGF-b receptor I kinase activation in
hematopoiesis, we next wanted to test the efficacy of LY2157299, a novel clinically relevant small-molecule inhibitor of
TBRI (31-35). We first demonstrated that LY-2157299 was able
to potently inhibit TBRI-mediated SMAD2 activation in hematopoietic cells (Fig. 4A and B). Next, we tested whether LY-215
was able to reverse the inhibitory effects of TGF-b in primary
hematopoietic stem cells. Primary CD34þ cells were grown in
methylcellulose in the presence and absence of TGF-b and LY2157299. As predicted, TGF-b led to quantitative and qualitative inhibition of hematopoietic colonies (Fig. 4C and D). LY215 was also able to abrogate the suppressive effects of TGF-b
on erythroid and myeloid colonies in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C and D) thus demonstrating its functional ability in
hematopoiesis.
LY-2157299 can improve anemia in a model of bone
marrow failure
To further examine the efficacy of LY-2157299 in vivo, tested
it in a transgenic mouse expressing a fusion gene (Alb/TGF)
consisting of modified porcine TGF-b cDNA under the control
of the regulatory elements of the mouse albumin gene. (26).
We have shown that these mice constitutively secrete TGF-b,
become anemic and have histologic marrow findings that
mimic human MDS, thus serving as an in vivo model of bone
marrow failure. (36) These mice were randomized into treatment or placebo groups on the basis of pretreatment hematocrits. Blood counts were measured after 14 days of oral

¼ 5 mmol/L). TGF-b1–induced control normalized Luciferase activity was significantly increased after SMAD7 knockdown. This increase was potently

administration of LY-2157299 or vehicle. TBRI inhibitor treatment led to inhibition of constitutive SMAD2 activation in
murine bone marrows (Fig. 5) and significant increases in
hematocrit in these mice demonstrating the specificity of LY2157299 in inhibiting TGF-b signaling and abrogating the
hematopoietic defects induced by it (Fig. 5).
LY-2157299 can stimulate MDS hematopoiesis
Finally, we tested the ability of LY-2157299 in vitro in 10
primary MDS bone marrow samples. These patients had lowgrade MDS and did not have increased blast counts (Table 1).
Mononuclear cells from the bone marrow were grown in
methylcellulose with cytokines in the presence and absence
of varying doses of LY-2157299. MDS bone marrow cells
exhibit poor hematopoietic colony formation in concordance
with the hematopoietic failure seen in these patients (Table 1).
Treatment with the TBRI inhibitor, LY-2157299, resulted in a
significant increase in erythroid (BFU-E) and myeloid (CFUGranulocytic Monocytic) colony numbers in all patients
(results depicted as means; Fig. 6). These results point to a

high therapeutic potential of TBRI inhibition by LY-2157299 in
low-grade MDS.

Discussion
The discovery of effective treatments for MDS has been
challenged by the limited insight into molecular pathogenesis of the ineffective hematopoiesis seen in these disorders.
Even though TGF-b levels have been shown to be elevated in
subset of MDS cases, our previous work has shown that
intracellular signaling is activated in large proportion of
cases. Thus, based on our findings, SMAD7 downregulation
may be the key mechanism driving the suppression of
hematopoiesis in MDS via overactivation of the TGF-SMAD2
pathway. This would also explain increased TGF-b signal
transduction even in the absence of large amounts of
circulating TGF- b that has been observed in various studies
in MDS patients (14–17).
SMAD7 is an important regulatory protein that has been
implicated in TGF mediated effects in many disease and

cancer models (37). In fact, genome-wide association studies
have shown SMAD7 SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism)
to be most significant alterations (38) in colorectal cancer
demonstrating its importance in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. Another recent study showed that decreased SMAD7
is also seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and contributes
to TGF-b–mediated fibrosis seen in this disease (39). Our
studies demonstrate the role of SMAD7 in hematologic malignancies for the first time and implicate its reduction as an
important molecular alteration in preleukemic bone marrow
failure disorders such as MDS. The bone marrow at earlier
stages of MDS is hypercellular and is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis affecting both stem and progenitor
cells. Because TGF-b is a well-known critical regulator of
hematopoiesis and affects both stem and progenitor growth
and maturation (40), increased TGF-b signaling may potentially explain the dysplastic appearance of progenitors as well
as ineffective hematopoiesis of stem cells seen in these
patients.

There could be many possible reasons for SMAD7 reduction
in MDS. Nearly 40% of MDS cases are characterized by deletions affecting chromosomes 5, 7, 18, 20, Y, and others. In fact,
the deletion of chromosome 18/18q, in which the SMAD7 gene
is located, was noticed to be the fourth commonest deletion in
the largest cohort of MDS patients described recently (41). In
addition, it has been shown that reduction in levels of genes
that are deleted in MDS can have functional consequences on
disease pathobiology as illustrated recently by the deletion of
ribosome gene, RPS14, in subset of MDS with chr5q deletion
(42). Thus, SMAD7 reduction could be a result of 18q deletions
seen in patients. Recent studies using high resolution array–
based technologies have shown that small deletions can also be
seen commonly in MDS and thus can also affect the SMAD7
locus in patients that do not have large 18q deletions as seen on
conventional karyotyping studies (43). In addition to genomic
deletions, gene silencing in MDS also occurs via aberrant
promoter methylation (44, 45). In fact, DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and decitabine, have been approved
for the treatment of this disease. Furthermore, newer data from
genome-wide methylation studies suggests that epigenetic
silencing may be a dominant pathologic alteration in the
disease pathophysiology of MDS (46). Thus, it is quite possible
that SMAD7 is also silenced epigenetically in MDS and this may
result in increased TGF-b signaling and resulting hematopoietic suppression.
Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the activation of TGF-b pathway by SMAD7 reduction can be reversed in
TBRI inhibition, especially with a clinically relevant inhibitor
that is effective in vitro and in vivo. Ineffective hematopoiesis is
the cause of most of morbidity in patients with low-risk MDS.
Two thirds of all MDS cases are at the low-risk stage, have a
lower chance of progressing to leukemia and mainly suffer
problems associated with low blood counts. Thus, strategies
aimed at raising blood counts are needed to treat these
patients. Our data provides a rationale for using inhibitors
of TGF-b signaling and especially inhibitors of TBRI in this
stage of MDS. The type I TGF-b receptor selectively participates in TGF-b signaling whereas other activin-like and TGF-b

receptors can also participate in BMP and activin ligand
signaling (47, 48). Therefore, LY-2157299 selectively inhibits
TGF-b signaling, as it has demonstrated specificity for the
TGF-b type I receptor. LY-2157299 is a selective dihydropyrrolopyrazole, small-molecule inhibitor that competitively
binds to the ATP-binding site of the TBRI kinase domain
(31–34). This compound is clinically relevant and is presently
being tested in phase I trials in advanced malignancies. In
addition, other small-molecule and large-molecule TBRI inhibitors are also in development (33, 49) for various other
indications. Our findings provide a preclinical rationale for
bringing LY-2157299 and other similar agents into clinical
trials for MDS.
