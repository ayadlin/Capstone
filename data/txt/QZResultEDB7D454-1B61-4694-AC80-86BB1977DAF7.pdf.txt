In series dominated by adenocarcinoma histology, approximately 5% of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harbor an anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement. Crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant activity against ALK, has demonstrated high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival in ALK-positive patients enrolled in phase 1/2 clinical trials. In
2011, crizotinib received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of proven ALK-positive NSCLC using an FDA-approved diagnostic test. Currently, only break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization testing is FDA
approved as a companion diagnostic for crizotinib; however, many other assays are available or in development. In the current review,

INTRODUCTION
Patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements
can derive significant clinical benefit from crizotinib (Xalkori; Pfizer, La Jolla, Calif), a small molecule inhibitor of the
ALK tyrosine kinase.1 In August 2011, crizotinib received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of proven ALK-positive NSCLC using an FDA-approved diagnostic test.2 To date, only fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Vysis break-apart probe kit (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, Ill) is FDA
approved for this indication. However other tests exist, and several of those are, or may become, commercially available
and may seek regulatory approval in the future.
ALK Biology

ALK is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase involved in development that is largely silenced in most adult tissues.3
Oncogenic activation of ALK can occur through several different mechanisms.4 Although primary activating mutations
have been described in other cancers, ALK activation in NSCLC involves gene rearrangements that place 1 of several different 50 fusion partners and their associated promoters upstream of the region encoding the 30 kinase domain of ALK.5-7
The most common ALK rearrangement in NSCLC is a paracentric inversion on the short arm of chromosome 2 juxtaposing the 50 end of the echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene with the 30 end of the ALK gene.8
Rare reports of constitutive activation of the ALK tyrosine kinase resulting from fusion with genes other than EML4 in
NSCLC, including transforming growth factor (TFG), kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B), kinesin light chain 1
(KLC1), and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 3 (PTPN3), also have been described.9-12 In the EML4-ALK
fusions, it is known that the 50 EML4 partner can be variably truncated, creating different EML4-ALK variants, the biologic significance of which is under investigation.7,13-15
ALK Testing in Non–small Cell Lung Cancer

Although ALK activation in NSCLC was described only in 2007, since the middle 1990s, multiple different methods for
detecting ALK activation have been explored in the lymphoma field, several of which have been applied to NSCLC.16-18
In addition, new techniques have been developed since the discovery of ALK in NSCLC. The pros and cons of these
different techniques are described in detail below and in Table 1. A schematic of the major techniques is provided in

influence protein levels and location; preferentially detects
higher levels of expression that may (or may not) be
associated more with outcome from specific intervention;
allows use of archival FFPE tissue; requires only a small
amount of tissue, but the exact number of cells needed for
reliability of assay has not been determined; technical

Fluorescence in situ hybridization

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing
involves using fluorescently labeled DNA probes to bind
to and localize specific genomic regions in the tumor
nuclei on tissue sections. The Vysis ALK break-apart
FISH test (Abbott Molecular) was used as the diagnostic
test in all of the initial and ongoing registration clinical trials of crizotinib.1,22 ALK break-apart FISH sets also have
been used in conjunction with separate break-apart FISH
probe sets focusing on the partner genes (eg EML4 breakapart probe sets).12,23 Fusion probe sets, which use fluorescent probes to identify the specific translocation partner for FISH, also exist, but none of these alternative
FISH techniques been used prospectively in any ALK
inhibitor trials to date.24,25
Break-apart ALK probe set

The 50 and 30 fluorescent probes in the Vysis breakapart assay bind to areas upstream and downstream,
respectively, of the common rearrangement breakpoint in
exon 20 of the ALK gene. In the color pairing used in the
commercial assay, the 50 probe is labeled with green fluorophores, and the 30 probe is labeled with orange fluorophores (but the signal generated is usually detected with
1468

the interference filter set in the red wave length range and,
thus, is observed as red). In the normal ALK gene state,
the red and green signals are sufficiently closely apposed
that, together, they are referred to as a fused signal, sometimes registering as a composite yellow signal. Within
each cell, the different component signals (red, green, or
fused) form different positive or negative patterns. When
rearrangement occurs, the red and green signals separate
farther apart than in the native state. In the classic ‘‘split’’
positive pattern, isolated red and green signals separated
by at least 2 signal diameters are observed, even a single
example of which is sufficient to designate a cell as positive. In addition, if an isolated red (30 ) signal occurs without a coexistent green signal being present to identify a
split pattern, then such ‘‘single red’’ patterns also are considered positive.1,26 A single red pattern is presumed to
indicate that a rearrangement has occurred with either loss
of the 50 probe binding site completely or within the plane
of section. One positive pattern (split or single red) usually prevails in tumors, suggesting that true 50 loss may be
occurring, although mixed positive patterns can be
observed.26 In contrast, fused and single green (50 ) patterns (given that the latter may involve loss of a binding
site located in the kinase domain itself) are considered

Diagnostic Assays for ALK in NSCLC/Weickhardt et al

Figure 1. This is a schematic of major anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) testing methodologies. (a) Note that reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) focused solely on the ALK kinase domain, searching for a threshold signal in a
quantitative assay, is not fusion partner-specific; whereas RT-PCR that spans the common breakpoint in rearrangements is fusion
partner-specific and searches for the presence/absence of a generated amplicon. EML4 indicates echinoderm microtubuleassociated protein like 4; EML4 v1 and EML4 v2 refer to two of the possible variants of EML4. Break-apart fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) testing is not fusion partner-specific. IHC is also not strictly fusion partner-dependent. However, because
transcriptional activity is set by the promoter/enhancer of the 50 fusion partner, and different fusion proteins may have both different intracellular locations (because of an association between the 50 oligomerization domains in the fusion protein with the
native form of the 50 partner as well as with the rearranged form) and, along with different fusion variants, potentially different
half-lives, the absolute protein expression levels and patterns of staining with IHC may vary, depending on the exact ALK fusion
and/or variant present.19-21 Techniques not presented here include FISH testing using fusion probe sets, chromogenic in situ
hybridization, and next-generation sequencing. (b) Different break-apart FISH testing patterns include (clockwise from top left)

negative in relation to predicting benefit from ALK inhibitor intervention.26 It is noteworthy that, because not every copy of ALK in a cancer cell is rearranged, both fused
and rearranged signals coexist in the same cell (ie, in a positive cell, at least 1 fused signal and 1 isolated red signal,
either with or without an isolated green signal per cell, are
likely to be observed). The different patterns are illustrated in Figure 1b.

Although the detection of specific patterns determines whether an individual cell is counted as a positive,
it is the overall proportion of positive cells across multiple
cells in the same tumor that determines whether the tumor itself is designated ALK-positive or ALK-negative.
Copy number gain of both native and rearranged ALK signals has been noted in NSCLC. Although copy number
gain of rearranged signals has been associated with
1469

Review Article

acquired resistance to crizotinib, the mean copy number
per cell of either type of signal is not currently considered
in the determination of initial ALK positivity.27-29 In
vitro responses to very high concentrations of crizotinib
(median, 1750 nM) have been noted in cell lines manifesting native copy number gain.30 However, at more
physiologically achievable doses (<250 nM), there
appears to be no association with native copy number and
responsiveness to crizotinib.31 In addition, in most cases
of native copy number gain, the pattern of gain is diffuse
within tumor cells, consistent with it reflecting general
chromosomal aneusomy rather than a specific selection
for this region. Abundant focal amplification of native signals does occur, but it is very rare (0.8% of ALK negative
cases) and may be worthy of more detailed exploration in
the future as an ‘‘atypical negative’’ (see below).31
In the clinical trials of crizotinib, a tumor specimen
was defined as positive for an ALK rearrangement if
>15% of scored tumor nuclei demonstrated a positive
pattern.1,26 Within the FDA-approved companion diagnostic, this percentage currently is listed as 15%. This
cutoff point was chosen because it appeared to sit within a
natural gap in the continuum of ‘‘percentage cells positive’’ that allows distinguishing true-positive tumors from
the technical background noise of the assay.26,32,33 More
recently, as larger numbers of samples have been analyzed,
small proportions of negative samples appear to closely
approach the >15% cutoff point for determining tumor
positivity.31 To reliably determine whether any of these
may represent false-negatives, either reinterrogation of the
samples with alternative diagnostic techniques and/or an
assessment of their response to crizotinib would be
required. It is noteworthy that several retrospective and
prospective studies evaluating different diagnostic techniques and prospective studies evaluating the response to
crizotinib of borderline and atypical negative cases (such
as single green signals or native copy number gain) are
planned under both commercial and cooperative oncology group guidance.
Because positive cell counts in positive tumors usually are far less than 100%, does this reflect clonal heterogeneity within the tumor, with ALK rearrangement
considered either a late event in tumorigenesis or an
expendable event in some situations, or does it reflect false
cellular negative results generated within the assay?25
When a series of contiguous high-power fields of ALKpositive tumors were evaluated, and each individual field
was assessed for whether it did or did not meet positive tumor criteria, no evidence of positivity as a focal event
could be observed.26 There appears to be no correlation
1470

between the percentage positive cells and the maximal
percentage shrinkage according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in ALK-positive
tumors treated with crizotinib (correlation coefficient [r]
¼ 0.192; P ¼ .3).34 In addition, there is a strong linear
correlation between the percentage positive cells and the
copy number of isolated red signals (contributing to both
of the accepted positive patterns; ie, split and single red
patterns; r ¼ 0.743; P ¼ .0001).34 This finding is consistent with multiple copies of the relevant signal increasing
the chances of detecting a positive pattern in any given
cell.34 Overall, these data suggest that the majority of negative cells in ALK-positive tumors represent false cellular
negatives rather than true biologic negatives.
Given the potential for both false cellular positives
and negatives with the break-apart FISH assay, analyses of
very small numbers of cells could be misleading.26 The
FDA-approved assay requires counting a minimum of 50
tumor cell nuclei for a first reader with a requirement for
counting an additional 50 cells by a second reader in cases
with >10% but <50% positive tumor cell nuclei.
In terms of the quantity and quality of tissue
required to conduct the ALK FISH assay, even very small
samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue or a single unstained section on a slide may be
adequate for analysis. Bone biopsies usually are considered
unsatisfactory for FISH analysis because of the effect of
decalcification on the quality of the genomic DNA.35
This may sometimes be avoided by the use of ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid-based decalcification agents.32,33
Alternatively, a bone aspirate performed after the bone biopsy needle is inserted can be used to prepare a cell pellet
suitable for further processing without requiring decalcification treatment.
The Implications of US Food and Drug
Administration Approval of the Vysis
Break-Apart Probe Set

Within the initial phase 1 study of crizotinib, the ALK
break-apart FISH assay was used by means of purchased
reagents at individual investigators’ sites. Within subsequent studies, a kit version of the same assay was used,
and a central vendor was used to form the basis for FDA
approval of the Vysis kit.
Generally, FDA approval reduces the requirement
for individual laboratories to perform extensive clinical
and technologic validation for the assay. Specifically, a
laboratory can conduct a verification (instead of a validation) to confirm that the assay performs as intended in the
course of routine operations. This also reduces the upfront
costs to establish an assay in a particular laboratory.
Cancer

Diagnostic Assays for ALK in NSCLC/Weickhardt et al

However, to remain ‘‘on-label,’’ all elements of the assay
must be performed exactly according to FDA-approved
instructions. This includes identification of specific pieces
of equipment by brand and model number and branded
reagents. For laboratories that already offer similar testing,
the procurement of a specific piece of instrumentation
exclusively for the assay and the use of specifically branded
reagents when a laboratory already has established
procedures for similar assays may be problematic. Not
surprisingly, FDA-approved assays often cost more
than their non-FDA–approved counterparts. In addition,
once assays become FDA approved, the non-FDA–
approved counterpart from the same company may be
discontinued.
One significant advantage of FDA approval of assays
is the standardization of interpretive criteria. In the example of ALK rearrangement testing, the percentage of positive cells required to call a specimen positive would be
standardized for the FDA assay, whereas a laboratory performing an in-house, non-FDA–approved assay may determine its own cutoff. Although the validity of individual
cutoffs can be debated, standardization across laboratories
certainly makes interlaboratory comparison more meaningful and simplifies the clinical interpretation of reports.
Break-Apart Chromogenic In Situ Hybridization

Recently, brightfield, dual-color, break-apart chromogenic
in situ hybridization (CISH) assays have been described.
Possible benefits of this technique include simultaneous
assessment of tissue morphology while observing the relevant genetic abnormality and minimal signal quenching
over time. Major limitations of this approach include
reduced ability to discern the degree of split between 50
and 30 signals because of larger diameter signals and
reduced visual contrast of signals compared with FISH.
In a recent report, assuming that break-apart FISH represents the current gold standard, 5% (1 of 19) of ALK
FISH-positive cases (determined using Vysis break-apart
probes) were reported as negative using CISH.36

cycle using fluorescently labeled probes, and the cycle at
which this reaction reaches a threshold level is recorded.
Whereas earlier approaches required fresh-frozen tissue
because of the known impact of formalin fixation in the
degradation of RNA, newer commercially developed
PCR techniques may overcome such limitations and allow
accurate assessments from FFPE tissue.38,39,42
Fusion partner-specific polymerase chain
reaction primer sets

Fusion partner-specific PCR techniques have the
ability to identify the exact fusion partner in an activating
ALK rearrangement from FFPE tissue, and it has the
potential to distinguish different breakpoints in the same
50 partner.38,39,42 Because of the variable length of EML4
sequence combined with typically shorter RNA fragments
derived from FFPE tissue, multiple EML4 primers are
used to minimize the amplicon size. Some fusion partners
or breakpoint variants may be missed if the primers contained in the assay are not specifically designed to evaluate
these alterations. When ALK FISH-positive cases were retrospectively analyzed for EML4-ALK transcripts by RTPCR in the initial phase 1 study of crizotinib, transcripts
could not be detected in 31% of cases.1 Although some of
these RT-PCR–negative cases may represent a failure of
technique, they also may represent uncommon EMLALK variants or non-EML4 fusion variants that were
being missed by the primer sets used in the assay. Similarly, in a Japanese study that examined the use of RTPCR for EML4-ALK, 4 of 12 (33%) ALK FISH-positive
samples were negative, raising further concerns regarding
the sensitivity of PCR as a broad screening assay for
ALK.43 Finally, although the specificity of RT-PCR as a
screening tool is likely to be extremely high, especially if
the amplified regions of combinational DNA (cDNA) are
sequenced, the dangers of cross-contamination, for example, from reuse of the same blade at sectioning, means that
false-positive results may occur with this highly sensitive
technique.

Polymerase Chain Reaction

Several reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)-based techniques for detecting ALK rearrangements exist.37-40 PCR of genomic DNA for fusion genes
can be problematic, and most PCR techniques for detecting ALK rely on determining the presence of specific messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript.41 The presence and size
of amplicons are evaluated, either with or without DNA
sequencing, to rule out the possibility of false (ie, nonspecific) priming. Quantitative PCR assays are similar, except
that detection of amplicons is measured after each PCR

exploit the observation that ALK is expressed at negligible

gene is used (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B
[COX5B]).40 It remains unknown whether the expression
of native ALK in the brain will affect the validity of the
test when applied to tissue from brain metastases.16
Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for ALK, which also
capitalizes on the minimal expression of native ALK in
most normal tissues,6 is a another potential method of
detection, and various antibodies are currently in commercial development (Table 2).44,46,47 Although IHC is now
the dominant ALK screening methodology in lymphomas
because of the high level of expression observed with the
common 50 partners in ALK-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in other ALK-positive diseases, including NSCLC,
the expression level of the fusion protein is lower, and the
development of routine IHC has been more problematic.44,45,50 In addition, it should be noted when reviewing
the available literature on IHC for ALK in NSCLC that a
single, uniform technique, or comparator, has not been
evaluated. Instead, there is significant variance in the antibody being considered; the number and type of specimen
being examined; which antigen retrieval, antibody detection, and amplification techniques were used; which scoring technique was used; what ‘‘gold standard’’ was used for
comparison; and how intensively the reliability and reproducibility of the overall technique across different laboratories and observers was examined. If only FISH-positive
cases are assessed in a study, then, although the sensitivity
of a second technique like IHC can be determined, its
specificity cannot.1,45 When mixtures of FISH-positive
and FISH-negative cases are assessed, both sensitivity and
specificity may be determined, but the degree of enrichment of the cohort being tested for factors associated with
ALK positivity may significantly affect the transferability
of the results to differently selected/unselected populations. For example, if only reasonable sized studies that
compare IHC versus break-apart FISH testing are considered, then the cohorts explored range from unselected,
consecutive case series comprising approximately 70% adenocarcinoma to series that only assessed either adenocarcinomas occurring in never-smokers or nonsquamous
cancers known to be epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) wild-type/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor nonresponders (Table 2).47,48 When different antibodies have
been compared head-to-head in NSCLC, D5F3 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, Mass) appeared to be both
more sensitive (100% vs 67%) and more specific (99% vs
97%) than the ALK1 antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria,
Calif).44 In contrast, studies using other antibodies have
1472

reported increased sensitivity through the use of several different signal amplification steps.24,45,49 Semiautomated
quantification using an Aperio-derived score intensity (the
average absorbance of pathologist-determined positive
areas multiplied by the percentage of area staining above
baseline) has been used,44 but most of the scoring systems
reported have used a visual, semiquartile range (0 to 3þ),
with the fine details of how each scoring category within
the range is defined varying between studies (Table 2).44
At its best, IHC has reported sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97% compared with FISH testing, and the IHC
kappa value for interobserver agreement is 0.94.44 However, sensitivities as low as 67% and interobserver agreement as low as 0.5 also have been reported.44,46
Consequently, it would appear that, although IHC
already seems to perform sufficiently well in some expert
centers to allow it to be considered as a primary screening
tool, standardization of IHC to reliably reproduce the
results of such high-performing centers across multiple
sites is required. Numerous technical steps in tissue preparation and processing and IHC procedures are subject to
laboratory-to-laboratory variability, including preprocessing fixation time, fixation parameters, specific chemical
composition of processing and embedding reagents, type
of antigen retrieval performed, heating device for antigen
retrieval, primary antibody incubation time, detection system, and counterstaining method.51 Consistent with the
potential for sample processing before IHC to affect outcomes, even when multiple samples from the same patient
have been assessed in the same center, variation in IHC
signal scoring from positive, through equivocal, to negative has been reported, despite the persistence of FISH
positivity.44 Should an antibody gain FDA approval for
ALK testing, acceptable ranges for many of these different
parameters probably would be specified. The most notable
previous example relating to the challenges of IHC standardization is in the evaluation of breast human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer.52,53
Even after significant experience with HER2 IHC testing,
multiple studies have highlighted continuing interlaboratory discordance rates of up to 35%.54-56 However, if test
variability and interpretation can be addressed, then the
potentially lower cost and greater ease of performing the
test eventually may lead to widespread use of the assay
beyond key expert centers, either alone or as a screening
test before FISH testing (see above).

multiple analytes simultaneously. The use of NGS for
detecting gene copy number alterations and rearrangements is feasible, and this broad discovery approach already has been used to identify several novel ALK
rearrangements and other relevant fusion genes in
NSCLC.9,57-60 However, adoption, particularly of
quicker, focused approaches, examining only specific panels of genes, is growing in the clinical setting. Like in
PCR-based approaches, if a focused approach is taken,
then fairly detailed knowledge of what is being searched
for is required to avoid missing a significant number of
rearrangements. Perhaps the major potential advantage of
using an NGS approach is that a well designed panel may
be able to provide information on a significant number of
the known gene mutations, gene rearrangements, and
copy number alterations across multiple different cancers
within a single multiplexed assay, minimizing the decision-making required for clinicians or pathologists when
considering which test to order for each patient. Thus, as
the amount of tissue required and the cost of NGS
decreases and clinical laboratories and regulatory bodies
increasingly validate these platforms, the convenience and
cost-effectiveness of screening for multiple different
abnormalities in populations at the same time (as opposed
to running multiple, discrete assays) is likely to drive the
wider adoption of this approach.61 There are multiple different NGS platforms, such as PacBio RS (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, Calif), Ion Torrent PGM (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif), and Illumina HiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, Calif)62; however to our knowledge,
there are no large data series that allow comparison of
ALK detection between these platforms and the current
gold standard of break-apart FISH testing.
Other Techniques

Because ALK fusions represent abnormal proteins that do
not occur in nontransformed tissues, proteomic-based
approaches potentially applicable to small volumes of
many different body fluids or tissues examining for the
presence of specific fusions have been reported but are not
commercially available to date.19,63
Rationalizing the Differences Between ALK
Detection Techniques

Given the high clinical benefit reported in ALK FISHpositive patients who received treatment with crizotinib,
we must assume that break-apart FISH testing represents
the current gold standard for detecting ALK positivity.
When considering any other technique, several questions
arise. First, how reliably do these other techniques capture
the same FISH-positive population? Specifically, what is
1474

their sensitivity and specificity for detecting these same
cases across different laboratories and different observers?
In the most simplistic assessment, any technique with reproducible 100% sensitivity and specificity may be a reasonable alternative to break-apart FISH testing, with
preference for 1 test over the other being based on the feasibility/expertise of any chosen provider and the costs to
the payer. However, what happens if a new test detects less
than the number of FISH-positive cases? Are these falsenegative results, or could the new assay be even more accurately delineating those patients who will derive clinical
benefit from crizotinib than the FISH test, given that not
100% of FISH-positive patients will benefit from crizotinib?1,28 Similarly, if an alternative methodology detects
more than the number of FISH-positive cases, then are
these false-positive results or a new population set to benefit from crizotinib that previously was missed (Fig. 2)?
Currently, we do not know the answers to these questions.
Detailed clinical outcomes from crizotinib therapy are
only available from patients enrolled on clinical trials, all
of whom were proven to be ALK-positive using the Vysis
break-apart FISH assay.1,28 However, within well constructed studies in the future, examining the benefit from
crizotinib in patients who are prospectively known to be
positive or negative by multiple different ALK detection
assays, we should be able to start to address these issues
directly.
It is possible that, ultimately, a single test may not
be adequate. Sometimes, 1 technique may be preferable
over another on a case-by-case basis, depending on the
specimen available. For example, decalcified bone specimens may be more appropriate for IHC than for
FISH.24,26,49 Two-tiered approaches using 1 primary
assay and a different secondary assay to confirm or deny
the true ALK nature of equivocal cases already have been
proposed. IHC or RT-PCR could be used to explore
FISH equivocal cases on the basis of either cell counts
close to, but below, the cutoff point for determining tumor positivity or with atypical negative cytogenetic patterns.31,45 More commonly, however, as with Her2, 2tiered testing has been proposed using IHC as a potentially more convenient and/or cheaper primary assay,
reserving FISH as potentially a more stringent but more
labor-intensive and/or more expensive second assay for
equivocal IHC cases.46,47,53,54 This approach rests on
emerging data that, for several different antibodies and
scoring techniques, completely negative IHC cases appear
to be true-negatives with respect to FISH and that strong
IHC-positive cases (eg 3þ) tend to be uniformly FISHpositive.46-49 Therefore, confirmatory ALK FISH testing

Diagnostic Assays for ALK in NSCLC/Weickhardt et al

Figure 2. Hypothetical comparisons are illustrated for different diagnostic techniques versus a biologically ‘‘true’’ anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive patient population. Definitive determination of the validity of techniques with higher or lower positivity rates will depend on head-to-head clinical comparisons entailing the expansion of access to ALK inhibitors beyond only
patients who have positive results from break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.

Figure 3. This schematic illustrates a possible 2-tier testing
strategy for detecting anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and confirmatory ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for IHC equivocal
cases. For the purposes of this illustration, an IHC staining
score of 3þ would be considered true-positive, and an IHC
score of 0 would be considered true-negative. The resource
and cost-effectiveness implications of this approach will
depend on the ultimate cost of a validated IHC assay, the
absolute number of cases falling within the equivocal category, and the proportion of cases that are FISH-positive
residing within the equivocal category. These equivocal category variables will be affected both by the specific IHC assay
used and by any aspects of patient enrichment applied to
the tested population.

would only need to be applied as a second screen to capture the small numbers of missed ‘‘true’’ ALK-positive
cases by testing, for example, either only IHC 2þ cases or
both 2þ and 1þ cases (Fig. 3). When such a scenario is
modeled, because of differences in the techniques used
and in the degree of preselection of the cohorts assessed,
the proportions of true ALK-positive specimens that fall
within any ‘‘equivocal’’ IHC group vary significantly
between studies (Table 2). For example, estimates of
FISH positivity rates among IHC 2þ cases range from
33% to 85%.46-48 To determine the potential cost saving
in practice of a 2-tiered approach, the absolute size of the
Cancer

1þ and 2þ groups would have to be known.46,48 In addition, because only the break-apart FISH assay is currently
FDA approved, the true cost of a reliable IHC assay to
accurately inform cost-effectiveness calculations currently
remains unknown. However, to illustrate the potential of
a 2-tiered approach, combining 2 recent ALK IHC
articles together to include 554 screened cases in total, a
combined strategy may entail FISH screening 48 IHC 2þ
cases and 1þ cases to identify 5 additional ALK FISHpositive cases.46,47 At its most simplistic, in this example,
such a tiered approach may be cheaper but as effective as
using FISH on everyone, provided that a validated IHC
assay was at least 9% (48 of 554) less expensive than the
FISH assay (cost of IHC assay ¼ X, cost of FISH assay ¼
Y, with overall cost saving to the 2-tiered approach if 554
Y > 554 X þ 48 Y).Alternatively, if payers are not committed to finding every ‘‘true’’ ALK-positive case but
would consider adopting approaches with <100% sensitivity if they are significantly cheaper, then the cost of the
life-years lost and gained from such approaches would
have to be calculated and the payers’ acceptability of these
costs determined.50,61
In conclusion, the approval of crizotinib offers a
new specific therapeutic option for patients with ALKpositive NSCLC. Maximizing the appropriate use of crizotinib depends on the deployment of assays for detecting
ALK positivity that are accurate, reproducible across multiple centers, and scalable. Currently, break-apart FISH is
the only testing methodology recommended for ALK testing within the draft College of American Pathologists/
International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/
Association of Molecular Pathology guidelines.63 PCR,
IHC, and (potentially) NGS tests are now also available
locally and, in some cases, commercially and offer some

advantages and disadvantages. Factors like changing costs
and local experience may influence the initial choice of
assay. However, future studies will be required to directly
compare and contrast these different testing methodologies in relation to predicting benefit from crizotinib.
