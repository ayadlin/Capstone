ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor. Even with aggressive
treatment, prognosis for patients is poor. One characteristic of glioblastoma cells
is its intrinsic resistance to apoptosis. Therefore, drugs that induce alternative cell
deaths could be interesting to evaluate as alternative therapeutic candidates for
glioblastoma. Salinomycin (SLM) was identified through a chemical screening as a
promising anticancer drug, but its mechanism of cell death remains unclear. In the
present work we set out to elucidate how SLM causes cell death in glioblastoma cell
lines (both established cell lines and brain tumor stem cell lines), aiming to find a
potential antitumor candidate. In addition, we sought to determine the mechanism
of action of SLM so that this mechanism can be can be exploited in the fight against
cancer. Our data showed that SLM induces a potent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
followed by the trigger of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and an aberrant
autophagic flux that culminated in necrosis due to mitochondria and lysosomal
alterations. Of importance, the aberrant autophagic flux was orchestrated by the
production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Alleviation of ROS production restored
the autophagic flux. Altogether our data suggest that in our system the oxidative
stress blocks the autophagic flux through lipid oxidation. Importantly, oxidative stress
could be instructing the type of cell death in SLM-treated cells, suggesting that cell
death modality is a dynamic concept which depends on the cellular stresses and the
cellular mechanism activated.

INTRODUCTION

The three main cell death modalities described
for cancer cells are apoptosis, autophagic cell death
and necrosis [6]. In the context of tumor development,
apoptosis, which is associated with specific morphological
cell changes [7], can be understood as acting as a barrier
to tumor growth [8]. Macroautophagy (herein autophagy)
is a cellular resistance mechanism with the ability to
recycle cellular organic material with the objective to
produce energy, when autophagy is overloaded, it could
culminate with cell death, a phenomenon referred to as
autophagy-associated cell death or autophagy-mediated

Of all primary brain tumors, glioblastoma is
the most aggressive. Despite the rigorous treatment,
recurrence occurs in most patients, and median survival
is just 14.6 months [1–3]. One feature that characterizes
glioblastoma is that its cells show an intrinsic resistance
to apoptosis [4, 5]. Therefore, drugs that induce cell death
in ways other than apoptosis are alternative therapeutic
candidates for glioblastoma, and the study and evaluation
of such drugs will potentially provide useful knowledge.

cell death [9, 10]. Cell death by necrosis can occur in
several ways, all of which lack the features of apoptosis or
autophagy-associated cell death. This modality includes
a broad variety of molecular pathways with specific
morphologic features: cytoplasmic swelling, rupture of the
plasma membrane, swelling of organelles, and moderate
chromatin condensation [11]. Cell death by necrosis
can be “programmed” - in which case it is referred to
as regulated necrosis - or not. Despite the considerable
amount of information that has been obtained on the
subject of regulated necrosis cell death, no definitive
markers have been identified, and, therefore, the main
distinguishing criteria for necrosis cell death are the lack
of both apoptosis and autophagy-associated cell death [10].
Salinomycin (SLM) is a coccidiostat that has
proven to be a highly effective agent at killing not only
bulk tumor cells but also cells in the recalcitrant cancer
stem cell compartment [12]. Despite the well-known
antitumor effect of SLM, the mechanism by which SLM
brings about cell death remains poorly understood. Several
reports have addressed the question of the modality of cell
death induced by SLM, but there is still no consensus:
some authors have proposed apoptosis, others autophagic
cell death and others necrosis [13–16].
SLM acts as an ionophore for K+ and Na+ ions
[17], which means that the cellular concentrations of
these cations will be balanced by SLM, thereby altering
membrane potentials (ΔΨ), such as the mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm), and that of the lysosome
through these ions movement [18]. It is rational to think
that SLM brings about cell death by inducing mitochondria
and lysosome dysfunction due to the loss of membrane
potentials, which in both organelles involves Na+ and/or
K+ [19, 20]. The above considerations, we believe, make
SLM a particularly interesting candidate drug to evaluate
in glioblastoma.
In the work we report here, we set out to elucidate
how SLM causes cell death in glioblastoma cell lines.
Understanding the biological underpinnings of SLMinduced cell death could aid in designing more effective
and less toxic therapeutic strategies, whether based on
SLM itself or not, for glioblastoma. In our experimental
system, SLM was at the cross roads of various different
modalities of cell death, and study of SLM shed much
light on the various mechanisms and processes involved.

comparing it with that of temozolomide (TMZ), the firstline treatment for glioma. SLM had a lower half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) than TMZ in all the cell
lines tested regardless of differentiation status (Figures 1A
and S1A and Table 1).
In view of the suggestion that SLM preferentially
targets the cancer stem cell compartment [12], we
compared SLM IC50 in GSCs versus established cell lines.
SLM had lower IC50 in GSCs than established cultures
(Figure 1B). Moreover, the self-renewal capacity, which is
an intrinsic property of stem cells, was markedly reduced
in SLM-treated BTSCs relative to TMZ-treated BTSCs;
similarly, neurosphere size was smaller and markers of
undifferentiation were drastically reduced in SLM treated
BTSCs when compared with TMZ (Figures 1C–1D and
S1B–S1D).
In summary, in vitro SLM exerts a robust cytotoxic
effect in established glioma cell lines and BTSC cell lines.

SLM treatment does not trigger apoptosis and
blocks the autophagy flux in glioma cell lines
It has been shown that SLM treatment results in the
upregulation and activation of several key Endoplasmic
Reticulum (ER) stress proteins [21], including the
multifunctional proteins BIP and CHOP [22]. In our
study, we observed an increase in BIP and CHOP levels
for 48 h after treatment with SLM, indicating ER stress
and activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)
(Figure 2A). CHOP is a transcription factor which
promotes apoptosis [23, 24]; however, we did not detect
activation of effector caspases in cells treated with
SLM (Figures  2A–2C and S2A). We further confirmed
the absence of apoptosis evaluating FITC-Annexin V
and PI staining in SF188 and GSC11 cell lines after
treatment with different SLM concentrations. The results
showed that SLM treatment did not increase the number
of apoptotic cells when compared with untreated cells.
Administration of TMZ significantly increased the
percentage of apoptotic cells in comparison with control
or SLM-treated cells (Figure S2B). These data allowed
us to rule out apoptosis as the mechanism of cell death
induced by SLM.
Next we interrogated whether SLM induces
autophagic cell death. Treatment of glioma cells (GSC11
and SF188) with SLM resulted in a moderate but significant
increase in the percentage of acidic vesicles when
compared with vehicle or TMZ treated cells, (18 ± 6.3%
and 21 ± 4% for SLM 10–7 and 10–6M, respectively for
GSC11 cell lines and 21 ± 3.5% and 21 ± 7% for SLM
10–7 and 10–6M, respectively for SF188) (Figure S2C).
We proceeded to assess cellular morphology by electron
microscopy. TEM images showed that there were more
intracellular vesicles in SLM-treated cells than in untreated
cells and confirmed the formation of autophagosomes,
autolysosomes and/or lysosomes in cells treated with SLM

(Figure 2D). At the biochemical level, we observed time
and dose dependent LC3-I to LC3-II conversion in SLM
treated cells; this LC3 lipidation suggests an increase in
autophagosome synthesis (Figures 2E and S2D). The
amount of p62 protein, however, was not reduced by
SLM treatment (Figures 2E and S2D). These data suggest
insufficient degradation of the cargo in autolysosomes and,
therefore, a block in the autophagic flux.
To gain a deeper understanding of the process,
we combined SLM with either bafilomycin A1 (BafA1;
a specific vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor), which is an
inhibitor of autophagy, or RAD001 (everolimus), which
promotes autophagy. Treatment with either SLM alone
or BafA1 alone led to an accumulation of LC3-II and
p62. Combined treatment with SLM plus BafA1 resulted
in an even greater accumulation of p62, suggesting that
some degree of p62 degradation occurred in cells treated
with SLM alone. As expected, treatment with RAD001
alone resulted in a decrease in the amount of p62 levels.
Combined treatment with SLM and RAD001 resulted in
normal amounts of p62, indicating that SLM blocked the
p62 degradation driven by RAD001 (Figures 2F and S2E).

SLM can act as an ionophore for Na+ and K+
therefore it could lead to an unstable Donnan potential
and therefore interfere with lysosome maturation
(Figure S3A). The maturation of cathepsin B requires
an acidic environment that is only obtained in mature
lysosomes [25]. For this reason, active cathepsin B is a
possible marker for lysosome maturation. We observed
that treatment with SLM led to a decreased in active
cathepsin B levels in a concentration and time dependent
manner (Figures 2G and S3B). Active cathepsin B
decrease was not observed in cells treated with the positive
autophagy stimuli RAD001.
Next, we treated cells with a combination of SLM
and Nifedipine (Nife), which is a voltage sensitive
calcium-channel blocker [26]. Cells treated with a
combination of SLM plus Nife had dramatically fewer
amount of acidic vesicles than untreated cells and cells
treated with SLM alone (Figure S3C). Cells treated with
SLM plus Nife had less active cathepsin B than cells
treated with SLM alone (Figure 2H), which suggests
that SLM plus Nife blocked acidification and in turn the
maturation of cathepsin B.

Altogether the above results indicate that combination
of both drugs blocks the acidification and in turn the
maturation of cathepsin B. In addition, the impaired
autophagic flux observed in SLM-treated glioma cells can
be attributed to diminished lysosome activity

death monitoring the localization of the mitochondrial
protein AIF [31]. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed
that high doses of SLM resulted in release of AIF from
mitochondria into the cytoplasm from where it spread and
entered the nucleus (Figure 4B). AIF is an endonuclease
and, if in the nucleus, could induce DNA damage [32].
We observed double strand breaks in SLM-treated cells
(Figure 4C) and it is possible that this DNA damage is
induced as a consequence of AIF internalization.
In summary, our data reveals that SLM can disrupt
the ΔΨm and induce MOMP with the consequent release
and spreading of AIF.

SLM induces necrosis cell death
We proceeded to determine whether the cell death
induced by SLM could be through necrosis. We examined
the most widely-accepted executioners of necrosis:
low levels of intracellular ATP (energetic catastrophe),
lysosome membrane permeability (LMP) and osmotic
swelling [27, 28].
A time-dependent analysis of cell morphology
after SLM treatment corroborated an increment of
autophagosomes in cells in the early stages of treatment
(T = 24 h). At later times SLM-treated cells displayed
moderate chromatin condensation and cytoplasmic
swelling with rupture of the plasma membrane, both of
which are features associated with necrosis (Figure 3A)
[11, 28]. The observed cell morphology confirmed that
apoptosis was not the mechanism of cell death. In addition,
cells treated with increasing doses of SLM displayed
a decrease in intracellular ATP levels (Figure 3B). We
studied cathepsin B localization, which indicates the
degree of LMP [29], and observed that treatment with
high doses of SLM (5 × 10–6 M) resulted in the release
of cathepsin B from lysosomes (Figures 3C and S4A).
Altogether, these data suggest that SLM induced regulated
necrosis in glioblastoma cell lines.

SLM induced ROS modulates the UPR and the
autophagy flux in glioma cells
Another important consequence of disruption of the
ΔΨm is an increment in oxidative stress [33]. We found
SLM to trigger, in a concentration dependent manner,
an increased in the amount of ROS (Reactive Oxygen
Species) in glioma cell lines (Figure 5A). Apigenin (Api)
was used as a positive control since it is a well-known
H2DCF-DA oxidative agent [34].
To better understand the role of ROS in our model,
we used N-Acetyl-cystein (NAC) to reduce the oxidative
stress brought about by SLM [35]. Cells treated with
SLM plus NAC had lower levels of the protein ER stress
markers BIP, P-PERK and P-elF2α than cells treated with
SLM alone. These results indicate that there is a decrease
in the UPR when we reduced the amount of ROS with
NAC (Figures 5B). Regarding autophagy, LC3-II levels
remained constant in cells treated with SLM, regardless
of whether the cells were also treated with NAC, and this
indicates that the formation of autophagosomes occurred
independently of the induced oxidative stress. Importantly,
p62 levels were lower in cells treated with SLM plus
NAC when compared with cells treated with SLM alone
(Figures 5B and S5A). Finally, the addition of NAC to
the SLM treatment did not reduce the extent of cell death
(Figures 5C and S5B). These results suggest that SLM
induced an autophagic process but also increased the

SLM alters ΔΨm
Because SLM has been shown to alter ΔΨm
[30], we turned our attention to mitochondria. SLM
treated cells displayed significantly lower ΔΨm than
untreated cells (P < 0.05; Figure 4A), indicating the
possibility of alteration in mitochondrial functionality.
Next, we evaluated the mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP), which could trigger cell

production of ROS, which could have been interfering
with the autophagic flux; addition of NAC, however,
seemed to allow autophagic flux to continue and finally
induce cell death.

associated with processes in mitochondria. We propose
that the PONR in our system was mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization, and that, after MOMP, cell
death would be irreversibly triggered through the release
of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins such as Cyt C
or AIF, which would determine the mode of cell death:
apoptosis or programmed necrosis. In relation to this
line of thinking, note that other authors have proposed
that mitochondrial membrane permeabilization be
regarded as a checkpoint for apoptosis or cell death by
necrosis [38]. In our model, SLM triggered necrosis,
and we hypothesize that this is because apoptosis is
inhibited by a lack of intracellular ATP resulting from
mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial membrane
permeabilization results in programmed cell death, and
for this reason we propose that the cell death that occurred
in our experimental system is best described by the
term programmed-regulated necrosis. There are several
modalities of programmed-regulated necrosis that include
necroptosis [28], which is the best characterized process.
Without the evaluation of necrosome formation or death
receptors activity it is not possible to conclude that this is
the submodality of necrosis that takes place in our system.
That SLM increases ROS levels has been
demonstrated by several authors [13, 16, 17, 39], which
suggest that high levels of ROS are an overall consequence
of the SLM treatment. We propose that oxidative stress
is produced by a low mitochondrial ΔΨ. A large leak in
electron transport is known to generate superoxide anion
[40, 41], and these radicals can rapidly dismutate to H2O2,
which worsens the redox balance [42]. We demonstrated
that although oxidative stress did not interfere with
cytotoxicity in our model, it did play an important role
in determining the mechanism of cell death. Reducing
oxidative stress with NAC reduced the ER stress and the
UPR. Studies by other researchers indicate that ROS can
induce an increment of unfolded proteins, and when this
happens the UPR serves as an anti-oxidant mechanism
that can degrade the oxidized unfolded proteins [43]. In
parallel to its effect on the UPR, we found that oxidative
stress inhibited autophagy. We observed that lowering the
oxidative stress decreased the levels of p62 (Figures 5B and
S5A), which implies restoration of autophagic flux. Another
consideration to be taken into account is that an increase of
ROS levels can alter lysosomal lipids, and this could affect
lysosome-autophagosome fusion [44, 45]. In our study, in
cultures treated with SLM plus NAC there was frequently
co-localization of cathepsin B and Lamp1 (Figures 6B and
S6B), and so LMP had not occurred in the majority of cells.
On this basis, we propose that in our model
autophagic flux in SLM-treated cells was blocked by lipid
oxidation due to oxidative stress. Importantly, oxidative
stress could be instructing the type of cell death in SLMtreated cells, suggesting that cell death modality is a
dynamic concept which depends on the cellular stresses
and the cellular mechanism activated.

ROS modulates autophagy flux in SLM-treated
cells through lysosome membrane permeability
(LMP)
In order to validate our data, we analyzed the levels
of active cathepsin B after treatment with SLM/NAC.
Interestingly, the levels of active cathepsin B decreased
after SLM treatment even when NAC was also present.
The amount of p62, however, was lower with NAC
(Figure 6A). The implication is that even though NAC
addition did not restore active cathepsin B levels, there
was sufficient residual lysosomal activity to degrade p62.
Finally, we evaluated LMP as a possible
phenomenon that could be interfering with the autophagic
flux. In physiological conditions cathepsin B is localized
inside of the lysosomes therefore we assessed the
localization of cathepsin B. We used lamp 1 as lysosomal
marker. Control (untreated) cells showed a co-localization
of cathepsin B and lamp 1. SLM-treated cells displayed a
cathepsin B staining pattern spread throughout the cells
and outside the boundaries of lysosomes compatible
with LMP. In cells treated with SLM plus NAC, we
observed a different active cathepsin B pattern, with signal
accumulation of cathepsin B in specific places (Figures 6B
and S6A). The data are consistent with the hypothesis
that SLM treatment triggers an autophagic process that
cannot proceed adequately because of LMP resulting from
oxidative stress. Addition of NAC, however, enabled, the
autophagic flux to continue (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
The objective of this work was to elucidate the
mechanism of cell death induced by SLM in glioblastoma
cells, with the ultimate aim of facilitating rational design
of therapeutic intervention for the disease.
There are several hypotheses which could explain
the enhanced toxicity of SLM in GSC. One reasonable
explanation is that the GSC compartment has a diminished
ability to manage cation exchange. Recently, several
authors have found an association between Na+/K+
exchange and stem/progenitor cell characteristics and also
poor prognosis, such as, aggressive and resilient tumoral
growth [36, 37]. An implication of this hypothesis is that
disruption of the balance of Na+ and K+, as brought about
by SLM, could be therapeutic.
Understanding the point where the cell will
inexorable die (also called Point of Not Return: (PONR))
could help us to understand why SLM is so efficient
at triggering cell death. In our model, the PONR was

MATERIALS AND METHODS

(1:1, vol/vol) supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine
Serum, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA). All
the cell lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2 at 37ºC.

Cell lines and culture conditions
The adult cell lines GSC23, GSC11, GSC7-2,
GSC2-27, GSC5-22, GSC2, GSC231, GSC7-11, GSC10-6,
GSC11-28 and GSC229 were kindly provided by Dr.
Lang (Department of Neurosurgery; MD Anderson
Cancer Center, USA). BTSC lines were maintained as
neurospheres [47]. The pediatric cells line SF188, KNS42,
RES259, RES186 were kindly provided by Dr. Jones
(Institute of Cancer Research, UK). The established cell
lines: U87 MG, U373 MG, U251 MG and T98G were
obtained from the ATCC. Attached cell cultures were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle/F12  medium

Reagents
Cells were treated with different compounds: SLM
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), TMZ (Dpt. of Pharmacy,
University Hospital of Navarra), BafA1 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO), RAD001 (Everolimus, Selleck Chemicals,
Houston, TX), Nife (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), NAC
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Each of these reagents
was resuspended according with the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Figure 7: Schematic representation of the authors’ proposed model of the action of SLM in glioblastoma cells. (A) SLM

induces a direct alteration in mitochondrial ΔΨ and as consequence a disruption in the Donnan potential of the lysosomal membrane. SLM
thus partially inhibits lysosome maturation leading to a reduction in the amount of active cathepsin (B) Although there is no doubt that
SLM induces an aberrant autophagic flux, the role of the Donnan potential in this respect is not clear. In the case of mitochondria, SLM
induced a decrease in the ΔΨ and an increase in the levels of intra-mitochondrial calcium and ROS. In our proposed model, this oxidative
stress triggers the UPR. The elevated levels of calcium and ROS inside mitochondria results in MOMP which leads to release of AIF. Once
AIF spreads into the nucleus, it damages DNA through its endonuclease activity. The presence of AIF would establish a feedback loop that
would cause cell death by a mechanism of regulated necrosis. In parallel to this, we propose that it should not be ruled out that the action
of SLM involves other different molecular routes that could lead to regulated necrosis. For example, a mitochondrial membrane alteration
would directly cause a deficit of ATP, which would cause energetic failure, which would, in turn, provoke cell death by regulated necrosis. In
addition, impairment of mitochondrial activity would trigger mitophagy, with engulfment of the organelle and initiation of autophagy. A key
role in our proposed model is played by oxidative stress, which blocks autophagic flux, probably through a process involving lipid oxidation.

Cell viability assay

Immunoblotting analysis

Cell lines were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells
per well in a 96-well plate. Cells were treated with SLM
and/or TMZ at concentrations ranging from 1 × 10–9 M to
1 × 10–3 M. Seven days later, cells were incubated with
MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 2 h at 37ºC.
Afterwards, supernatants were removed and DMSO
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added (50 μl) to
each well. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength
of 540 nm in a Sunrise microplate reader with Magellan
software (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

After the indicated treatments total cell proteins
were extracted on ice with buffer lysis (1% tween in PBS)
in the presence of freshly added protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined using
the Bradford method. A total of 40 μg/lane protein extract
was separated by Tris/Glycine SDS-PAGE and transferred
to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories;
Hercules; CA). Non-specific binding was blocked with
non-fat milk 5% in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature.
Blots were incubated with the following antibodies: P62
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), LC3A/B, BIP, ATF4,
P-elF2α, CHOP, caspase 3, cleaved caspase 7, P-H2A.X
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), cathepsin B
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Lamp1 (Abcam plc,
Cambridge, UK). As housekeeping markers we used
GAPDH (Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK), GRB2 (BD
Transduction Laboratories™, San Jose, CA) and α-Tubulin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Amersham’s enhanced
chemiluminescence protocol (Perkin Elmer Waltham,
MA) was used to develop membranes.

ATP assay
After the indicated treatments, cells were rinsed
three times with PBS and counted in a Neubauer
chamber (Celeromics, Grenoble, France) for the
subsequent standardization. Boiled deionized water
was used to wash away broken cellular membranes
and inhibited ATPase molecules [48]. After vortexing
and centrifuging the mixture (4ºC, 12,000 g for 5 min),
a 20 μL suspension of each sample was quantified by
bioluminescence with the ATP kit from Molecular
Probes (Invitrogen). The reagents and reaction mixture
were combined according to the protocol of Molecular
Probes; Bioluminescence was detected using Lumat LB
9507 (Midland, Canada).

Caspase assay
After the indicated treatments, cells were
incubated with Caspase-Glo Reagent and, after one
hour, bioluminescent fluorescence was detected using
spectrofluorometer (SpectraMAX gemini XS, Molecular
devices). Luminescence is proportional to the amount
of caspase activity present, and so the proportional
fluorescence intensity of treated cells relative to non-treated
cells enables determination of differences in calpain activity.

Determination of mitochondrial membrane
potiential, ΔΨ, using the Rhodamine-123 probe
Cells that had previously been treated with the
reagents tested were incubated with Rhodamine-123
(RH-123) (10 µM) during 30 min at room temperature
with protection from light. Cells were then rinsed twice
with medium and incubated for an additional 30 min
with medium supplemented with serum. After this time
106 cells/ml were resuspended in PBS (500 μl) and
PI 5 μM. Membrane potential was measured with a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using the
CellQuest software.

Quantitative real-time PCR experiments
The relative levels of RNA messenger of:
p62, Musashi, Sox2 and Nestin were standardized
with 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), by real time PCR
(RT-PCR) using an ABI 7700 sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The
expression levels relative to 18S were calculated using
the ddCt method [49], P values were calculated by
analysis of variance using Microsoft Excel. Primer
sequences used were as follows: P62 (forward primer
5′- GCACCCCAATGTGATCTGC -3′; reverse primer
5′-CGCTACACAAGTCGTAGTCTGG -3′), Mushashi
(forward primer 5′-GGGACTCAGTTGGCAGACTAC-3′;
reverse primer 5′-CTGGTCCATGAAAGTGACGAA-3′),
Nestin (forward primer 5′-CTGCTACCCTTGAGAC
ACCTG-3′; reverse primer 5′-GGGCTCTGATCTCTGC
ATCTAC-3′), Sox2 (forward primer 5′-ACCGGCGGCA
ACCAGAAGAACAG-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCGCCG
CGGCCGGTATTTAT-3′).

Measurement of ROS production using the
2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate probe
Cells were plated in 6-well plates and incubated
with the different treatments. 48 hours later, cells were
collected by centrifugation (5 min, 1500 rpm) and
resuspended in whole medium. Then cells were incubated
with the probe -2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA; from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen) (40 µg/ml) a
37ºC. At this point cells were rinsed twice with PBS and
then analyzed by flow cytometry.

Glioblastoma cells were cultured on glass coverslips
and fixed with methanol. Samples were blocked in phosphatebuffered saline/fetal bovine serum 10%. Cells were then
incubated with antibodies directed against the following
proteins: AIF (Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK), Lamp1 and
Cathepsin B (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 h
at room temperature. Afterwards, samples were incubated
with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 594, monkey antirabbit and/or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA). All antibodies were
used in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions. The
cover slips were mounted with mounting medium with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories INC, Burlingame, CA). Finally, the
fluorescence signals were visualized and digital images were
obtained with the fluorescence microscope Zeiss Axioplan
2ie (Zeiss International, Germany).
