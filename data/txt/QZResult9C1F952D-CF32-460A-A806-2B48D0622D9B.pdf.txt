Abstract
The immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumors hampers the induction of antitumor immunity by
vaccines or immunotherapies. Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands have the potential to treat tumors, but they can
exert a mixture of positive and negative effects on inﬂammation in the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we
show that speciﬁc small molecule inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) relieve immunosuppression to
heighten the proinﬂammatory effects of TLR ligands that support antitumor immunity. Multiple strategies to
inhibit PI3K in dendritic cells (DC) each led to suppression of interleukin (IL)-10 and TGF-b but did affect IL-12 or
IL-1b induction by the TLR5 ligand ﬂagellin. In three different mouse models of cancer, combining ﬂagellin with a
class I PI3K inhibitor, either with or without a DC vaccine, delayed tumor growth and increased survival, with
some animals exhibiting complete rejection and resistance to secondary challenge. Tumor growth suppression
was associated with increased accumulation of polyfunctional T cells that secreted multiple effector cytokines,
including IFN-g, IL-17, and IL-2. Therapeutic protection was abolished in mice deﬁcient in IL-17 or deprived of
IFN-g. Together, our results indicate that PI3K inhibition heighten the antitumor properties of TLR ligands,
eliciting tumor regression directly but also indirectly by relieving suppressive signals that restrict potent
antitumor T-cell responses. These ﬁndings suggest important uses for PI3K inhibitors in heightening responses
to cancer immunotherapy and immunochemotherapy. Cancer Res; 72(3); 581–91. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The induction of effective antitumor immune responses is
hampered by several factors, including the immunosuppressive
nature of the tumor environment and poor inﬁltration of immune
cells into the tumor mass. Antitumor responses can be induced
in vivo by adoptive transfer of in vitro activated autologous dendritic cells (DC) primed to present tumor rejection antigens. Because
DCs play a critical role in directing adaptive immune responses,
this approach has considerable potential for generating antitumor
effector T cells and the ﬁrst DC-based cancer vaccine has recently
been licensed (1). Nevertheless, tumor vaccines still have limited
success in mediating tumor regression (2, 3).

Activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) on DCs leads to
maturation and induction of cytokines that regulate adaptive
immunity against pathogens and tumors. The TLR7/8 agonist,
imiquimod is used in the treatment of superﬁcial basal cell
carcinoma (4). However, other studies with TLR agonists have
met with limited success in treating human cancers (5). This
may reﬂect the dual nature of responses induced by TLR
agonists, with the production of both pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines (5). This dual activity coupled with the
suppressive tumor environment, replete with anti-inﬂammatory cytokines and regulatory T (Treg) cells, has limited wider
clinical application of TLR agonists as tumor therapeutics.
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is
an important target for tumor therapy by virtue of its role in cell
survival and its dysregulation in tumors (6, 7). Several inhibitors of PI3K or mTOR have already been tested in phase I and II
clinical trials (7–9). The class 1 PI3K are a family of dualspeciﬁc lipid and protein kinases that control many cellular
functions, such as growth, proliferation, and apoptosis (10) and
consist of PI3Ka, PI3Kb, PI3Kd (class-IA), and PI3Kg isoforms
(class IB). Expression of PI3Ka and b is ubiquitous, whereas
PI3Kd and g are expressed mainly by leukocytes (11).
PI3K is also activated by TLR signaling in innate immune
cells, in which it seems to regulate inﬂammatory cytokine
production (12, 13). However, the precise role for PI3K subtypes in DC activation and cytokine production remain unclear
(12–16). In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that

inhibition of speciﬁc isoforms of PI3K will inhibit anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, allowing enhancement of inﬂammatory
cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-12, thereby promoting antitumor immunity (17). We show that synthetic inhibitors of
different PI3K isoforms not only mediate tumor cell killing, but
in combination with TLR agonists promote IFN-g- and IL-17–
secreting T cells, leading to eradication of tumors in vivo.

Immunoblot analysis for phosphorylated PI3K
DCs were stimulated as described above; after 15 minutes
cells lysates were prepared and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels
and blotted onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore). Total PI3K
p85, phospho-PI3K p85/55, total PI3K p110, p110b, p110d, and
pan-Actin were detected using the appropriate antibodies (Cell
Signaling Technology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Materials and Methods

Tumor challenge model
Mice were challenged with B16 melanoma (2  105 B16.F10
cells in C57BL/6 mice), CT26 carcinoma (5  105 CT26.WT cells
in BALB/c mice), or LLC (1  106 LL/2 cells in C57BL/6 mice).
All 3 tumor cell lines form solid tumors in mice when challenged subcutaneously with tumor cells into the ﬂank. Tumorbearing mice were treated with subcutaneous injections of 5 
105 to 9  105 DCs or with direct injections (subcutaneously at
the site of the tumor) of ﬂagellin (200 ng/mouse; dose determined by titration for signiﬁcant in vivo cytokine production
following subcutaneous immunization) and/or class I PI3K
inhibitor (0.042 or 0.42 mg/mouse) on days 3, 10, and 17
posttumor induction. In certain experiments, mice were
injected intraperitoneally every 2 days from day -1 with 0.5 mg
of anti-mouse IFN-g antibody (clone XMG1.2).

Animals and cell lines
C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Harlan. IL-17-deﬁcient
(il-17/) mice (18) were provided by Y. Iwakura (University of
Tokyo, Japan). Use and care of mice was approved by the Trinity
College Dublin ethics committee and the Irish Department of
Health. B16.F10 melanoma, CT26.WT colon carcinoma, and
[LL/2 (LLC1)] Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (LGC Standards).
PI3K inhibitors
Synthetic inhibitors of PI3K subtype signaling were purchased and used at concentrations determined by reference to
manufactures' instructions and titrations to determine minimum concentrations to negatively affect secretion of IL-10 and
positively affect secretion of IL-12p70 from ﬂagellin-stimulated
DCs (PI3-kinase a Inhibitor 2 (Cayman Chemical) was used at
10 nmol/L (19); PI3Kb signaling was inhibited by the addition
of 100 nmol/L TGX-221 (Cayman Chemical; ref. 20); PI3Kd
signaling was inhibited by addition of 10 mmol/L IC87114
(Caltag Medsystems; ref. 21); AS252424 (Cayman Chemicals)
was used to inhibit PI3Kg signaling by addition to cultures at 50
nmol/L (22). For inhibition of class I PI3K signaling, the pan
class I PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 was used at 50 nmol/L for in
vitro stimulations and at 0.042 or 0.42 mg/mouse for in vivo
experiments (Axxora; L.C. Laboratories; refs. 23, 24).
DC activation and transfer
Mouse bone marrow–derived DCs were generated as previously described (25). DCs were pretreated with PI3K inhibitors
for 30 minutes prior to stimulation with ﬂagellin (100 ng/mL
from S. Typhimurium; Invivogen; dose determined by reference to
manufacturers' instructions and titration for induction of signiﬁcant IL-12p70 and IL-10 production by DCs), and 1 hour before
the addition of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; 5 mg/mL) or
heat-shocked irradiated B16 tumor cells (hs/irB16) (26) at a 1 to 1
ratio to DCs. After washing, 5  105 to 10  105 cells were injected
subcutaneously; IL-10, IL-12p70, TGF-b, and IL-1b (R&D Systems) concentrations were quantiﬁed in supernatant by ELISA.
Intracellular cytokine expression was determined as described
(27) using ﬂow cytometric analysis on cells stained with antiCD11c-PE-Cy5 (eBioscience), anti-IL-10-PE (eBioscience), and
anti-IL-12p70-biotin (Becton Dickinson) followed by streptavidin A780 (eBioscience). DCs were also stained for expression
of maturation markers using speciﬁc antibodies [MHC class
II-FITC (ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate), CD40-FITC, CD86-A780
(all eBioscience), CD80-PE (BioLegend), CD205-Alexa 647 (AbD
Serotec)]. Cells were analyzed using Summit software on a
CyanADP ﬂow cytometer (Dako).

T-cell responses
Popliteal lymph nodes (1  106/mL) from mice 7 days after
DC transfer into the footpad were restimulated with KLH (10
mg/mL) for 72 hours before IFN-g, IL-10, and TGF-b concentrations were detected in supernatants by ELISA, or cells
stained for intracellular cytokines. Tumor-speciﬁc T-cell
responses were tested by stimulating splenocytes from
tumor-bearing mice with 1 to 20 mg/mL of an immunodominant CD8 T-cell peptide sequence (mTRP-2180–188; Genscript;
ref. 28). After 72 hours cell proliferation was measured by 3Hthymidine incorporation and cytokine concentrations in
supernatants were measured by ELISA.
The phenotype of tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes was determined by ﬂow cytometric staining tumor cells on day 22
posttumor induction. Single-cell suspensions of tumors were
stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin
(Sigma) for 2 hours prior to the addition of brefeldin A (5
mg/mL) for 4 hours. Cells were then stained for expression of
CD3, CD4, CD8, IFN-g, IL-2, IL-17, and IL-10 using the Intrastain kit (Dako). Cytokine producing cells were acquired using a
CantoII cytometer (BD). Analysis and presentation of distributions was done using FlowJo v9.2 (Tree Star Inc) and SPICE
version 5.1, downloaded from National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases Exon Website (29, 30).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using SigmaPlot 11 software
(Systat Software). Kaplan–Meier survival curves of mice in the
tumor challenge model were analyzed by the log rank survival
test. Differences between multiple groups were compared
using a one-way ANOVA with the Holm–Sidak method for all
pair wise comparisons (normally distributed data) or the
Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks with the Tukey test
method for multiple pair wise comparisons (nonnormally

between 2 groups were compared using the student's t test.
P values of less than 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
PI3K controls TLR-induced regulatory cytokine
production by DCs
We examined the involvement of PI3K signaling in the
activation of DCs with a range of TLR agonists. Stimulation
of murine bone marrow–derived DCs with the TLR2 agonist,
zymosan, the TLR3 agonist, Poly I:C, the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the TLR5 agonist, ﬂagellin or the TLR9

agonist, CpG induced secretion of varying concentrations of IL12p70 and IL-10 (Fig. 1A). Addition of a PI3K class I inhibitor
signiﬁcantly suppressed secretion of IL-10 by DCs stimulated
with TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 agonists, and signiﬁcantly
enhanced IL-12p70 in response to TLR2 and TLR5 activation.
In contrast, inhibition of PI3K enhanced IL-12p70 and IL-10
production by TLR9-stimulated DCs and suppressed TLR3induced IL-12p70 secretion (Fig. 1A). Because ﬂagellin induced
IL-12p70 and IL-10 production, the latter suppressed by the
PI3K inhibitor, and because it has been shown to be a safe and
effective infectious disease vaccine adjuvant in humans (31),
this TLR5 agonist was chosen for further investigation, with a
view to using it as an adjuvant for a cancer vaccine.

zymosan (Z; 25 mg/mL), the TLR3 ligand, Poly I:C (I; 200 mg/mL), the TLR4 ligand, LPS (L; 100 ng/mL), the TLR5 ligand, ﬂagellin (F; 100 ng/mL) or the
TLR9 ligand, CpG (C; 25 mg/mL) in the presence and absence of a class I PI3K inhibitor (0.025 mmol/L). After 24 hours of culture, IL-10 and

We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that DCs expressed TLR5 using ﬂow
cytometry analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We next examined the effect of a range of PI3K inhibitors with speciﬁcity
for different isoforms of PI3K on TLR5-induced cytokines by
DCs. Like the PI3K class I inhibitor, inhibitors of PI3Ka, b, d,
and g, signiﬁcantly suppressed IL-10 secretion by ﬂagellinstimulated DCs (Fig. 1B and C). Inhibition of PI3Kb or class I
signaling also suppressed both basal and ﬂagellin-induced
TGF-b secretion (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Inhibition of
PI3Ka or g signiﬁcantly suppressed IL-12 production, whereas inhibition of PI3Kb or d or class I did not signiﬁcantly
alter IL-12 production detected by ELISA (Fig. 1B). These
ﬁndings were conﬁrmed over a range of doses of inhibitors;
each of the inhibitors suppressed IL-10 production by ﬂagellin-activated DCs and PI3Ka and g, but not b or d or class
I suppressed IL-12 production over a wide dose range
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Intracellular cytokine staining conﬁrmed that inhibitors of PI3Ka, b, d, and g signiﬁcantly
suppressed IL-10 production, whereas inhibition of PI3Kb or
d signiﬁcantly enhanced IL-12, and inhibition of PI3Ka or g
signiﬁcantly suppressed IL-12 production (Fig. 1C). DC
maturation was also largely unaffected by inhibitors of
PI3Kb or d (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Class IA PI3K are composed of a p85 or p55 regulatory and a
p110 (p110a, b, or d) catalytic subunits. Flagellin activation of
DCs promoted phosphorylation of PI3K p85, as shown by
Western blot analysis with an antibody speciﬁc for phosphorylated PI3K p85 and p55 regulatory subunits (phosphorylation
of p55 was not detected; Fig. 1D). Inhibitors of PI3Kb, d, g, and
class I, but not PI3Ka, attenuated ﬂagellin-induced phosphorylation of PI3K p85 (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig. S4). Expression
of total p110 or p110b or d was not appreciably affected by any
of the inhibitors examined. Although expression of total P85
was reduced by PI3Kb and class I inhibitors, expression of
phospho P85 relative to total P85 was reduced by inhibitors of
PI3Kb, d, g, and class I (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results
suggest that TLR agonist–induced signaling via PI3Kb and d
seems to be critical for the induction of IL-10 and TGF-b, but
not IL-12 or maturation signals in DCs.
Inhibition of PI3K in DCs modulates their ability to
induced T-cell response in vivo
Because activation of DCs with ﬂagellin in the presence of a
PI3K inhibitor induced a cytokine proﬁle of low IL-10 and TGFb and high IL-12, these DCs should promote the induction of
Th1, but not Treg cells. We tested this hypothesis using a DCadoptive transfer model, in which DCs were activated in vitro
with ﬂagellin and the model antigen, KLH, in the presence or
absence of a class I PI3K inhibitor and injected subcutaneously
into naive mice. Assessment of KLH-speciﬁc T-cell responses
in the lymph node 7 days later revealed that transfer of KLHpulsed and ﬂagellin-stimulated DCs to naive mice induced
KLH-speciﬁc T cells that secreted IFN-g, IL-10, and TGF-b
(Supplementary Fig. S5). In contrast, the responses induced by
transfer of DCs treated in vitro with KLH, ﬂagellin, and PI3K
inhibitor was more Th1-polarized, with high levels of KLHinduced IFN-g and signiﬁcantly lower antigen-induced IL-10 or
TGF-b. Thus inhibition of PI3K suppresses innate IL-10 and

TGF-b production by TLR5-activated DCs, and allowed them
to selectively prime Th1 cells in vivo.
Inhibition of PI3Kb and d signaling modulates cytokine
production by DC tumor vaccine
We next examined the ability of PI3K inhibitors to
modulate cytokine production by TLR-activated DCs pulsed
with killed tumor cells. DCs stimulated with ﬂagellin and
hs/irB16 produced signiﬁcant levels of the proinﬂammatory
cytokines IL-12p70 and IL-1b, but also produced high levels
of anti-inﬂammatory molecules, IL-10 and TGF-b (Fig. 2A
and B). Treatment of DCs with PI3K inhibitors (b or d or pan
class I) signiﬁcantly reduced production of IL-10 and TGF-b
in response to ﬂagellin and hs/irB16, although having
no effect on production of IL-12p70, IL-1b (Fig. 2A and
B) or IL-23 (data not shown). Although the PI3Kd and class I
inhibitors did enhance expression of CD86, and the PI3Kb
inhibitor reduced expression of MHC class II, in general
inhibition of PI3K signaling did not adversely affect expression of maturation markers by ﬂagellin-activated DCs
(Fig. 2C).
Inhibition of PI3K signaling in DCs signiﬁcantly
enhances their antitumor efﬁcacy
We next examined if inhibitors of PI3K could improve the
efﬁcacy of DC-based tumor immunotherapy using an experimental model of melanoma. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice
with DCs pulsed in vitro with hs/irB16 alone or with ﬂagellin
showed minor but insigniﬁcant decreases in tumor growth
when compared with control PBS-treated mice (Fig. 3A) or DCs
treated with medium only (data not shown). In contrast,
treatment with DCs pulsed in vitro with hs/irB16 and ﬂagellin
in the presence of PI3K inhibitor showed a signiﬁcant decrease
in tumor growth and signiﬁcant increase in survival, when
compared with all other groups (Fig. 3A and B). Indeed, 40% of
mice completely rejected the tumor challenge following
administration of DC vaccine with the PI3K inhibitor and were
resistant to rechallenge with tumor (Supplementary Fig. S6),
suggesting induction of potent and functionally active effector
memory T-cell responses in these animals.
Mice treated with DC vaccine pulsed with B16 antigen,
ﬂagellin, and the PI3K inhibitor had signiﬁcantly decreased
numbers of tumor-inﬁltrating IL-10–secreting CD4þ and CD8þ
T cells and increased IFN-g–secreting T cells (Fig. 3C and D).
These results showed that protection induced with DC vaccine
pulsed with hs/irB16, ﬂagellin, and class I PI3K inhibitor was
associated with augmented antitumor effector T-cell responses
in vivo.
Direct administration of PI3K inhibitor and TLR agonist
induces antitumor immunity
We next tested the possibility that both the immunomodulatory and tumor cell killing effects of PI3K inhibitors could be
exploited in vivo by combining direct injections of a PI3K
inhibitor with a TLR agonist using 3 distinct tumor models.
We ﬁrst showed that inhibition of class I PI3K signaling
resulted in rapid cell death of B16 melanoma cells, CT26
carcinoma cells, and LLC cells in vitro (Fig. 4A). We next

assessed the ability of PI3K inhibitor to modulate TLR-induced
innate cytokine production in vivo, using a sepsis-type model,
based on LPS-induced serum cytokines. Injection of the TLR4
agonist LPS induced detectable concentration of IFN-g, IL12p70, IL-10, and TNF-a in the serum 4 hours later. Coinjection
of the PI3K inhibitor signiﬁcantly decreased LPS-induced IL10, did not affect IL-12p70, and signiﬁcantly enhanced TNF-a
and IFN-g concentrations in the serum (Supplementary Fig.
S7). This is consistent with the in vitro data using DCs (Figs. 1
and 2) and shows that the PI3K inhibitor has immunomodulatory effects on TLR-induced responses in vivo.
We next examined effect of coadministration of ﬂagellin and
PI3K inhibitor on tumor growth in vivo using 3 distinct models
(B16 melanoma, CT26 carcinoma, and LLC). Treatment, by
subcutaneous administration at the tumor site, with PI3K
inhibitor or ﬂagellin alone induced a modest delay in tumor
growth in all 3 models, but only in the LLC model did single
treatments with ﬂagellin or PI3K inhibitor signiﬁcantly affect
survival of mice. In contrast, treatment of tumor-bearing mice
with a combination of the PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin significantly decreased tumor growth and signiﬁcantly increased
survival in all 3 models (Fig. 4B and C). All mice treated with the
PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin rejected the LLC. In the B16 model,
mice that completely rejected the tumors were found to be
resistant to rechallenge with the tumor (Supplementary Fig.
S8). These ﬁndings suggested that the combination of PI3K

inhibitor and ﬂagellin is a highly effective therapy for inducing
antitumor immunity.
PI3K inhibitor promotes tumor-speciﬁc T-cell responses
by acting directly on the tumor cell and by modulating
TLR-induced cytokine production by DCs
To conﬁrm our hypothesis that direct cotreatment with
PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin was acting to both directly kill
tumor cells and to modulate antitumor immune responses, we
examined the requirement for class I PI3K inhibitor and
ﬂagellin at both the tumor killing stage and the immune
initiation stage of treatment. B16 melanoma cells were treated
in vitro with either ﬂagellin and/or class I PI3K inhibitor for 24
hours before being used as a source of antigen for DCs that
were also treated with ﬂagellin and/or PI3K inhibitor. In
addition, heat shock and irradiated B16 cells were also included as a source of antigen to serve as a positive control. These
DCs were then used to stimulate spleen cells (as a source of
memory T cells) taken from mice 40 days after injection of
tumors, which had been rejected by treatment in vivo with
subcutaneous injections of PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin. When
either unstimulated or FLG-activated DCs were used to present any of the tumor cell preparations (hs/ir, ﬂagellin, PI3K
inhibitor, or ﬂagellin and PI3K inhibitor treated-B16 cells), the
dominant response was the secretion of IL-10 (Fig. 5). In
contrast, DCs that were activated in vitro with PI3K inhibitor

signiﬁcant IFN-g and proliferative responses, with low IL-10
production (Fig. 5). This Th1 response was dependent on the
tumor cells serving as a source of antigen having been efﬁ-

ciently killed by either heat shocking and irradiating or being
exposed to PI3K inhibitor, as B16 cells treated with ﬂagellin
alone did not induce such responses (Fig. 5). Indeed, tumor

PI3K Inhibitors Improve Efﬁcacy of TLR-Based Tumor Vaccine

Recent reports have suggested polyfunctional effector T cells
that simultaneously secrete multiple effector cytokines are
more effective in killing tumor cells (32, 33) than cells that
secrete IFN-g alone. We therefore examined the possibility that
treatment with PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin could induce
polyfunctional CD4þ and CD8þ T cells that secrete combinations of IFN-g, IL-2, and IL-17 in vivo. Tumor-inﬁltrating
lymphocytes were stained with antibodies speciﬁc for surface
CD3, CD8, and CD4 and intracellular IL-10, IFN-g, IL-2, and IL17 and ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis done
and results analyzed using SPICE software. Control tumorbearing mice showed very little polyfunctional T-cell activation, with tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ T cells secreting IL-10 or IL17, but little IFN-g or IL-2 (Fig. 6B, Supplementary Figs. S9 and
S10). In contrast, tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ T cells from mice
treated with ﬂagellin and PI3K inhibitor produced signiﬁcantly
less IL-10 than tumor-bearing control mice and had increased
numbers of polyfunctional tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ T cells that
simultaneously secreted combinations of IFN-g, IL-2, and IL17. In particular, we found a high frequency of IFN-g þIL-17þ,
IFN-g þIL-2þIL-17þ, IFN-g þIL2þ CD4þ T cells inﬁltrating into
tumors in treated mice. A similar pattern of responses was
observed with tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells (Supplementary
Fig. S11).

Figure 5. PI3K inhibitors promote tumor-speciﬁc T-cell responses by both
killing tumor cells and modulating TLR agonist–induced cytokine
production by DCs. DCs were activated with the indicated combinations
of ﬂagellin, PI3K inhibitor, and B16 cells treated with heat shocking and
irradiating, ﬂagellin, or ﬂagellin with PI3K inhibitor as indicated, for 24
hours. DCs were then used to stimulate splenocytes from mice treated
with PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin that had rejected the implanted tumors
and proliferation by 3H-thymidine incorporation (A) and IFN-g (B) and IL10 (C) secretion quantiﬁed by ELISA.

inducing similar levels of IFN-g secretion to those induced by
DC-presenting antigen from hs/irB16 cells. These results supported the hypothesis that inhibition of PI3K signaling is
serving 2 discrete functions in vivo, direct killing of tumor
cells and promoting effector T cells through modulation of TLR
agonist-activated DCs.
Treatment with PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin induces
polyfunctional T cells
To determine whether treatment with ﬂagellin and PI3K
inhibitor induced antitumor responses in vivo, we assessed
tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell responses using the TRP-2 peptide
(28). Spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice treated with ﬂagellin and PI3K inhibitor proliferated and secreted IFN-g in
responses TRP-2 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, TRP-2–speciﬁc
responses were almost undetectable in mice treated with PI3K
inhibitor or ﬂagellin alone (Fig. 6A). These results indicated
that treatment of mice with ﬂagellin and PI3K inhibitor was
able to induce tumor antigen–speciﬁc type 1 T cell responses.

IL-17 and IFN-g are required for effective antitumor
immunity
Having shown that treatment with PI3K inhibitor and
ﬂagellin enhanced the inﬁltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells
that secreted IFN-g and IL-17, we examined the role of these
cytokines in mediating the reduction in tumor growth. B16
tumors were induced in wild-type (WT) and il-17/ mice or
mice treated with an anti-IFN-g neutralizing antibody, and
mice were treated with PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin or PBS as
a control. Treatment with PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin
signiﬁcantly decreased tumor growth in WT mice but not
in il-17/ mice or following neutralization of IFN-g
(Fig. 7A), showing that both IFN-g and IL-17 are both
required to mediate the antitumor effect of the combination
immunotherapy (Fig. 7A).
Assessment of CD4þ T cells inﬁltrating into the tumor mass
revealed that treatment with PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin
dramatically increased in the numbers of CD4þ T cells coproducing IFN-g and IL-17 with no IL-10 (Fig. 7B and Supplementary Fig. S12). The frequency of IFN-g–secreting tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes was signiﬁcantly lower in ﬂagellin and
PI3K inhibitor treated IFN-g–depleted compared with WT
mice. However these mice still had a high frequency of
IL-17–secreting T cells (Fig. 7B and Supplementary Fig. S12)
and had a lower frequency of cells secreting IL-10 and IL-17 or
IL-10 alone. Tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ T cells from il-17/ mice
treated with ﬂagellin and PI3K inhibitor lacked the high
proportion of IL-17 and IFN-g coproducing cells seen in
WT ﬂagellin and PI3K inhibitor–treated mice. However,
CD4þ tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes from treated il-17/
mice contained signiﬁcantly more cells secreting IFN-g alone
than treated WT mice (Fig. 7B; Supplementary Fig. 12). Collectively, the data showed that neither IFN-g–secreting T cells

mice were able to signiﬁcantly reduce tumor growth, indicating a key role for both IFN-g and IL-17 in PI3K inhibitor and
ﬂagellin treatment and providing further evidence that coproduction of these 2 effector cytokines is required for successful
tumor rejection.

Discussion
The signiﬁcant new ﬁnding of this study is that a TLR agonist
and PI3K inhibitor, which have separately shown promise in
treating tumors in humans, when combined are highly effective, either as a direct therapy or as part of a DC vaccine against
a variety of murine tumors, through the combined effect of
tumor killing and speciﬁc enhancement of polyfunctional T
responses that secrete IFN-g and IL-17.
The recent approval of Provenge by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, hormone-resistant metastatic prostate
cancer, suggests that the promise of active immunotherapies
for cancer may ﬁnally be fulﬁlling its potential (1, 34). However,
despite the approval of this ﬁrst DC vaccine, and the large
numbers of similar cell-based therapies and vaccines currently
in advanced clinical trials (34), the objective outcomes of these
treatment approaches fall well short of the desired cure for
cancer. Despite the ability to induce antitumor immune cells

588

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

in vivo, current immunotherapeutic approaches rarely induce
tumor regression in advanced patients. Overcoming the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor is a particular challenge
because we have to overcome local immune tolerance which
allows immune system to prevent responses against selfantigens.
The approach described in this article, which exploits but
modulates the ability of pathogen-derived molecules to induce
potent immune responses, provides a new strategy to overcome tumor immunosuppression and poor immunogenicity of
tumor antigens. The activation of innate immunity by TLR
agonists and other PAMPs, although effective at driving adaptive immunity via IL-12 and IL-1, is counteracted by simultaneous induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, including
IL-10 and TGF-b. We have identiﬁed a critical role for the PI3K
signaling pathway in the production of the immunosuppressive molecules induced by TLR agonist activation of DCs.
Indeed, we found that blocking PI3K signaling, especially
PI3Kb and d, in DCs inhibited IL-10 and TGF-b production
and modulated T-cell responses away from regulation and
toward polyfunctional effector T cells that were able to mediate
tumor killing and rejection in vivo.
Our ﬁndings in murine models are complemented by a
recent study with human DCs, which has shown that blocking
mTOR, a pivotal downstream mediator of the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway, promoted IL-12 and suppressed IL-10

production in response to TLR-dependent and TLR-independent stimuli (35). This suggests that PI3K inhibitors can
modulate TLR-induced cytokine production by human DCs,
and combined with our study, suggests that they may also
enhance antitumor immunity in humans. When coupled with
the immune stimulatory effects of TLR agonists, the overall
effect of inhibiting class I PI3K signaling directly in vivo was to
promote effector T cells responses and tumor regression.
Therefore, the use of PI3K inhibitors as a direct combination
therapy with TLR agonist induced similarly effective tumor
regression to the adoptive transfer of DCs primed in vitro with
PI3K inhibitor and ﬂagellin. However, direct administration
has the advantage over DC transfer of not requiring expensive
and time-consuming preparation of cells from individual
patients and exploits the capacity of the PI3K inhibitors to
mediate tumor cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest (9), allowing
us to exploit their immunomodulatory and tumor cytotoxic
effects.
It is well established that IFN-g, produced by CD4, CD8,
and innate immune cells, plays a major role in antitumor
immunity (17). The role of IL-17–secreting T (Th17) cells and
T cells coproducing IL-17 and IFN-g is less clear. There is

www.aacrjournals.org

some evidence to suggest that IL-17–mediated inﬂammation
may promote the development of tumors (36). However, it
has also been shown that Th17 cells may function in tumor
rejection either by acting directly on tumor cells or by
activating and recruiting other immune cells that mediate
tumor cell killing (36–38). We found that the PI3K inhibitor
suppressed IL-10 and TGF-b, but not IL-1b, IL-12p70, or
IL-23 by DCs, and this was consistent with the induction of
IFN-g and/or IL-17 producing T cells in vivo. Whereas TGF-b
in combination with IL-6 induces differentiation of Th17
cells, IL-1b with IL-23 promotes IL-17 production by Th17
cells (39). Indeed, it is likely that inhibition of IL-10 and
TGF-b are the critical factors attenuated by the PI3K inhibitor which enhance the potency of ﬂagellin as an adjuvant. It
has been shown that TGF-b and IL-10 promote induction of
Treg cells (40, 41). In addition, we have shown that IL-10–
defective DCs pulsed with TLR agonists and hs/ir tumor cells
are more protective than similarly pulsed wild-type DCs (26).
We have also reported that blocking TGF-b enhances Th1
and Th17 responses to infectious disease and autoantigens
(42, 43). Our demonstration that IL-10þ Treg cells are
reduced in vivo in mice treated with ﬂagellin and the PI3K

inhibitor, together with the ﬁnding that PI3K inhibitor
suppresses IL-10 and TGF-b production by TLR5-activated
DCs, is consistent with this conclusion.
We found that the antitumor effects of cotreatment with
TLR agonist and PI3K inhibitor were dependent on both
IFN-g and IL-17. Treatment with ﬂagellin and PI3K inhibitor
substantially enhanced the frequency of IFN-g þIL-17þ and
IFN-g þIL-17þIL-2þ CD4þ T cells tumor inﬁltrating the
tumors and this was associated with rejection or reduction
in growth of the tumor. We do not have direct evidence that
cells that coproduce il-17 and IFN-g mediate tumor rejection; however, we have shown nonredundant roles for IL-17
and IFN-g. The protective effect of the combination therapy
was abrogated in il-17/ mice or in mice treated with a
neutralizing anti-IFN-g antibody. The importance of polyfunctional T cells secreting multiple il-17 effector cytokines
in mediating antitumor effects is increasingly being recognized (32, 33). We found that production of IL-17 or IFN-g
alone by tumor-inﬁltrating T cells was not sufﬁcient to
mediate tumor rejection; signiﬁcant numbers of il-17–
secreting T cells were detected in mice depleted of IFN-g,
and signiﬁcant numbers of T cells secreting IFN-g were
detected in il-17/ mice, yet neither group of mice were
capable of controlling the B16 tumors. These observations
indicate that the antitumor effects induced with our combination therapy is mediated by T cells that secrete multiple
effector cytokines, including IFN-g and IL-17. Although
IL-17 and IFN-g coproducing cells have previously been

identiﬁed, this is the ﬁrst study to show a host protective
role for these cells in the control of disease and suggests that
they may be an important cell type to induce in the development of immunotherapeutic and vaccine approaches
against cancer in humans.
Our ﬁnding show that PI3K inhibitors have considerable
efﬁcacy in modulating antitumor immune responses induced
by TLR agonists in 3 distinct tumor models. This combination
is an attractive approach for translation to the clinic, given its
ability to mediate tumor regression via the induction of
signiﬁcant tumor-speciﬁc polyfunctional T-cell responses,
even against a poorly immunogenic and aggressive melanoma
tumor model.
