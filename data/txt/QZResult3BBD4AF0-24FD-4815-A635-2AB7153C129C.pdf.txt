ABSTRACT
The pro-apoptotic protein Bnip3 is induced by hypoxia and is present in the core
regions of most solid tumors. Bnip3 induces programmed necrosis by an intrinsic
caspase independent mitochondrial pathway. Many tumor cells have evolved
pathways to evade Bnip3-mediated death attesting to the physiological relevance of
the survival threat imposed by Bnip3. We have reported that acidosis can trigger the
Bnip3 death pathway in hypoxic cells therefore we hypothesized that manipulation
of intracellular pH by pharmacological inhibition of the vacuolar (v)ATPase proton
pump, a significant pH control pathway, may activate Bnip3 and promote death
of hypoxic cells within the tumor. Here we confirm that bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), a
selective vATPase inhibitor, significantly increased death of breast cancer cells in
a hypoxia and Bnip3-dependent manner and significantly reduced tumor growth in
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 mouse xenografts. Combined treatment of cells with BafA1
and the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 further augmented cell death. Combined treatment
of mice containing MDA-MB-231 xenografts with BafA1 and the ERK1/2 inhibitor
sorafenib was superior to either treatment alone and supported tumor regression.
BafA1 and sorafenib treatments alone reduced MDA-MB-231 cell metastasis and
again the combination was significantly more effective than either treatment alone
and was without apparent side effects. These results present a novel mechanism to
destroy hypoxic tumor cells that may help reverse the resistance of hypoxic tumors
to radiation and chemotherapy and perhaps target tumor stem cells.

INTRODUCTION

expression of multidrug resistance genes and selecting for
cells with mutated p53 [8-10].
The rate of glycolysis, already high in many aerobic
tumor cells, is increased even more in hypoxic regions
resulting in elevated lactic acid production and acidosis,
a situation that is further compounded by inefficient
vascular/lymphatic clearance of metabolic waste products
[11-13]. Tumors typically maintain a neutral intracellular
pH by elevated activity of carbonic anhydrase and
aggressive extrusion of protons [14-16]. The latter is
accomplished by the activity of at least four major ion
channels including the vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase),

Most solid tumors are characterized by regions
of transient hypoxia that frequently correlate with poor
clinical prognosis [1-3]. The hypoxic regions result from a
high oxygen demand of rapidly dividing cells at the tumor
periphery combined with a disorganized vasculature [4,
5]. The hypoxic zones typically boarder a necrotic core
that is deprived of blood supply [6, 7]. Tumor hypoxia
contributes to chemo and radiation therapy resistance
and generates a more malignant, metastatic phenotype by
favoring increased rates of mutagenesis, up-regulating the

the Na+/H+ exchanger, the bicarbonate transporters and
the monocarboxylate transporters [17, 18]. The vacuolar
ATPase belongs to a family of proton pumps associated
primarily with endosomes but present in the plasma
membrane in cancer cells [19, 20]. Pharmacological
inhibition of the vacuolar ATPase activity inhibits
autophagy and may promote apoptosis by reducing the
pH buffering capacity and promoting intracellular acidosis
[21].
Bnip3 is an atypical member of the BH3-only
subfamily of proapoptotic proteins with possible roles in
programmed cell death and autophagy, and myocardial
and neuronal ischemia/reperfusion injury [22-24].
Bnip3 is a hypoxia-regulated gene and its expression is
low to absent at normal physiological oxygen tension
but increases dramatically upon exposure to hypoxia/
ischemia [25]. Co-expression of Bnip3 and HIF-1α has
been demonstrated in multiple types of tumors including
prostate, lung, and endometrial [26-28]. More than 70% of
invasive breast cancer and 60% of ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) express Bnip3. In non-small cell lung carcinoma,
high levels of Bnip3 expression are associated with poor
clinical outcome and in prostate cancer Bnip3 expression
strongly correlates with the cancer stage or “Gleason”
score [26, 28].
The identity of Bnip3 as a positive prognostic
indicator of tumor progression appears paradoxical with its
role as a pro-apoptotic mediator, and some have concluded
that Bnip3 can actually provide a survival function by
increasing reparative autophagy [29, 30]. Alternatively,
our group has proposed that Bnip3, accumulated during
hypoxia is inactive and the death function requires a
second activation step such as coincident acidosis [31,
32]. This appears to be the case at least in striated cardiac
and skeletal myocytes where hypoxia alone does not
cause cell death despite marked elevations of Bnip3 33. In
contrast massive Bnip3-dependent cell death is seen when
hypoxia is combined with acidosis, a condition frequently
associated with chronic hypoxia or ischemia [32]. The
death pathway mediated by Bnip3 under conditions of
hypoxia-acidosis is characterized by the opening of the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore, release of
cytochrome c, calpain but not caspase activation and
extensive DNA fragmentation [25, 33, 34]. Because the
Bnip3 death pathway is so aggressive, we were interested
to determine whether it could be induced in hypoxic
breast cancer cells by blocking one of the major proton
ejection channels thereby disrupting the intracellular pH
buffer capability. To this end we found that inhibition
of the V-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 (Baf1A) indeed
activated the Bnip3 death pathway in vitro and in vivo.
We found that cell death by this mechanism was enhanced
by simultaneous inhibition of the ERK1/2 signaling
pathway. Using xenograft models we demonstrate that the
combination of Baf1A with the ERK inhibitor, sorafenib,
significantly improved treatment efficacy causing both

RESULTS
Bafilomycin A1 (Baf1A) induces cell death and
causes Bnip3 stabilization
Previously we reported that acidosis combined
with hypoxia conferred enhanced stabilization and
accumulation of Bnip3 relative to hypoxia at neutral
pH [31]. Therefore we asked whether inhibition of the
V-ATPase in cancer cells under hypoxic conditions
supported a similar stabilization and accumulation of
Bnip3 by conferring intracellular acidosis. As shown in
Figure 1, exposure of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells to hypoxia caused a progressive increase in
Bnip3 protein that started at 6 hrs of hypoxia and peaked
at 24 hrs. Despite induction of Bnip3 we observed no cell
loss during 72 hrs of hypoxic exposure. However, when
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the
V-ATPase inhibitor Baf1A before exposure to hypoxia,
Bnip3 protein levels were significantly increased relative
to hypoxia alone and there was a significant increase in
cell death (65 ± 8.5%; p < 0.05; verses untreated controls)
at 72 hrs. A similar increase in Bnip3 protein was observed

when MCF cells were treated with V-ATPase specific
siRNA (Figure 1E). To begin to address the mechanism of
Baf1A toxicity we measured other BCL-2 family members
and found no change in expression of the anti-apoptotic
proteins Mcl-xl and Bcl-2 or NOXA, another BH3-only
pro-apoptotic protein (Figure 1 F and G). In contrast
Baf1A treatment dramatically affected the expression of
the BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins PUMA and Bim.
PUMA protein levels were increased under hypoxia and,
similar to Bnip3 were further increased by Baf1A whereas
Bim expression was eliminated by Baf1A treatment. In
experiments not shown we found that inhibition of the
sodium bicarbonate transporter or the sodium hydrogen
exchanger with DIDS and amiloride respectively were
without effect on Bnip3 protein or cell death therefore the
effects were selective for the V-ATPase (Data not shown).
We have previously reported that the half-life of
Bnip3 is increased by hypoxia-acidosis and this accounts
significantly for the elevated levels of Bnip3 caused by
acidosis [31]. To determine whether Baf1A treatment
also increased Bnip3 protein half-life MCF7 cell were
exposed to hypoxia alone or hypoxia plus Baf1A and
protein translation was blocked with cyclohexamide.
Western blot analyses revealed that Baf1A treatment
increased the half-life of Bnip3 protein by 2.7 fold (n = 3)
over hypoxia alone (Figure 2A). Previously we reported
that acidosis reduced the susceptibility of Bnip3 protein
to digestion by proteinase k suggesting a conformational

change or membrane insertion in response to acidosis
[31]. To determine if Baf1A conferred a similar decrease
in Bnip3 proteinase k susceptibility, whole cell extracts
were prepared from MCF7 cells exposed to hypoxia
alone or hypoxia-Baf1A. The extracts were exposed to
increasing concentrations of proteinase k and the level
of Bnip3 protein determined by Western blot. As shown
in Figure 2B, Baf1A treatment significantly reduced
the susceptibility of Bnip3 to digestion by proteinase
k. In contrast, digestion of actin by proteinase k was
unaffected by Baf1A treatment and BAK, an integral
outer mitochondrial membrane protein, was unaffected
by proteinase k treatment under either condition. These
results indicate that inhibition of the vacuolar ATPase
increases Bnip3 protein stability possibly by promoting
intracellular acidosis and driving membrane insertion as
we have previously demonstrated [31].

knockdown Bnip3 protein. As shown in Figure 3A, Bnip3
expression was significantly reduced by Bnip3-specific
but not random sequence siRNA. Treatment of hypoxianeutral cells with Bnip3-selective or random sequence
siRNA did not affect cell viability as assessed by trypan
blue exclusion (Figure 3B). However cells exposed to
Baf1A-hypoxia, sustained significant loss of viability
which was ameliorated by Bnip3-selective siRNA (p <
0.02). To confirm that Baf1A can activate Bnip3 dependent
cell death we over-expressed Bnip3 in normoxic cultures
in the presence and absence of Baf1A. As shown in
Figure 3C, Bnip3 expression alone was without effect
on cell morphology relative to empty vector. In contrast,
treatment of cultures with Baf1A caused cell detachment
and rounding characteristic of cell death. The effect was
abolished when Baf1A treated cells were transfected with

a Bnip3 transmembrane deletion mutant (Βnip3ΔΤΜ).
The transmembrane domain of Bnip3 has been shown by
ourselves and others to be required for Bnip3 mediated
death [32, 35]. These results suggest that Baf1A activates
the Bnip3 death pathway in hypoxic MCF7 cells.

Pathway of Bnip3 mediated cell death.
We have reported that cell death caused by hypoxiaacidosis is associated with the release of cytochrome
c from the mitochondria but not caspase activation
[32, 33]. Instead our results suggest that calpains are
activated under these conditional and may be the central
mediators of cell death. To determine if a similar death
pathway is activated by the combination of hypoxia and
Baf1A we used subcellular fractionation to measure
cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. As shown
in Figure 4A cytochrome c was not significantly present
in the cytoplasmic fraction of aerobic or hypoxia-neutral

cultures but the levels increased markedly in extracts of
hypoxic cultures treated with Baf1A. Despite the apparent
increased cytoplasmic cytochrome c levels there was no
increase in caspase 3 activity (Figure 4B). Similarly Baf1A
treatment was not associated with the cleavage of ICAD,
a target of activated caspase 3 (Figure 1C). We conclude
that caspase-dependent cell death does not contribute to
cell loss by exposure to hypoxia-Baf1A. These results
are consistent with previous studies by Zhang et al. [36].

activation we measured the cleavage products of the

to vehicle-treated control animals. In this study Baf1A
reduced the rate of tumor growth but it did not cause
tumor regression (tumor volumes at day 50: vehicle 4.0
fold (p = 0.0077, n = 8) and Baf1A 2.0 fold (p = 0.031,
n = 10) over tumor volume at day 1 of Baf1A treatment.
To determine whether we could induce tumor regression
by a different delivery method that circumvented the
vasculature, we delivered Baf1A to MCF7 generated
xenografts by intratumoral injection. As shown in figure
5C, tumor volumes were reduced 45% (p<0.05; n = 10)
by Baf1A treatment compared to vehicle. However, and
more importantly, Baf1A treatment caused significant
tumor regression with 25% smaller tumor volumes than
at the onset of treatment. In comparison vehicle treated
tumors grew 138% larger over the same treatment period.

phosphorylation levels declined with increasing hypoxiaBaf1A exposure whereas there was a parallel increase
of MEK1/2 phosphorylation. Analysis of proteins
downstream of ERK1/2 revealed a reduction in ELK
phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of p90RSK
(Fig 7A). Interestingly, p90RSK is known to increase
the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger by phosphorylation,
an effect that may reduce the intercellular acidosis
caused by the loss of V-ATPase activity [37]. Inhibition
of ERK1/2 with U0126 reversed the Baf1A mediated
hyperphosphorylation of p90RSK (Figure 7B); an effect
predicted to inhibit protection by p90RSK. Similarly
pro-apoptotic Bim is targeted for ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation by ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
We found that Bim degradation during hypoxia-Baf1A
treatment was also prevented by U0126 treatment.
Therefore ERK inhibition is predicted to augment BafAmediated cell death in hypoxic tumor cells by blocking
multiple pathways associated with acidosis and intrinsic
apoptosis (Figure 7C).

MAPK pathways are activated by Baf1A
treatment.
Our results show that Baf1A treatment promotes
tumor cell death and can regress tumor volumes. As an
approach to investigate a more aggressive Baf1A-mediated
treatment we investigated the effects of Baf1A on survival
MAP kinases. As shown in Figure 6A, the phosphorylation
levels of ERK, p38 and JNK were all increased by Baf1A
treatment in both aerobic and hypoxic cells. Notably, the
effects of Baf1A on p38 and JNK were not dependent on
oxygen availability. However, ERK phosphorylation was
increased in the hypoxia-Baf1A group relative to normoxia
in the absence and presence of Baf1A. To determine
whether MAPK activity interfered with Baf1A-induced
cell death we used selective inhibitors of each of these
pathways and quantified cell death by LDH release. When
JNK or p38 were inhibited in aerobic cultures with or
without Baf1A there were trends for increased cell death
(Figure 6B). In contrast inhibition of either kinase in the
hypoxia-Baf1A group was associated with significantly
reduced cell death. This data suggests that p38 and JNK
may enhance Baf1A toxicity. Next we examined cell death
in the presence of ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. As shown
in Figure 6C and D, ERK inhibition alone increased the
level of cell death in both aerobic and hypoxic cultures.
ERK inhibition in the presence of Baf1A synergistically
increased cell death in both culture conditions. Baf1A and
U0126 mediated cell death was reduced when cells were
treated with Bnip3 specific siRNA suggesting that Bnip3mediated cell death is compromised by ERK1/2 activation
during Baf1A treatment (Figure 6E). These results suggest
that ERK activation is a survival response of these cells to
Baf1A treatment, an effect that may be mediated by pH.
To better understand the cytoprotective action of
ERK in the context of Baf1A-induced cell death, we
exposed MDA-MB-231 cells to hypoxia in the presence
and absence of Baf1A and quantified c-raf-MEK1/2ERK1/2 signaling. As shown in Figure 7A, c-raf protein

ERK inhibition augments the anti-tumor actions
of Baf1A.
Next we were interested in determining the
therapeutic potential of combinatorial treatment of
Baf1A with the ERK inhibitor sorafenib. Sorafenib is
an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including Raf and is
currently approved clinically for the treatment of renal
and liver cancers [38, 39]. As shown in supplemental
Figure 1 we found that treatment of MDA-MB-231-luc
cells with 0.5 μM of sorafenib was sufficient to reduce
ERK phosphorylation caused by hypoxia and Baf1A. To
determine the effect of sorafenib on tumor progression we
generated MDA-MB-231-luc xenografts in nude mice.
Mice with tumor volumes > 100mm3 were treated with
either sorafenib alone or combined with 1mg/kg Baf1A
i.p. as described in Methods. As shown in Figure 8A
and B, sorafenib treatment significantly blocked tumor
growth at all times relative to vehicle treated control mice.
Tumor volume in the vehicle group increased in a linear
manner reaching a final volume ~ 4x the starting size. In
contrast tumor volumes in sorafenib-treated animals were
not significantly different to those observed at the start
of treatment. It should be noted that sorafenib prevented
tumor growth but did not cause substantial tumor
regression. In contrast to sorafenib alone, the combination
of sorafenib and Baf1A resulted in a significant reduction
in tumor volume by treatment day 12 and continued to
decrease tumor volume by a factor of 40% of the starting
tumor volume by day 55. This data indicates that the
combination treatment of Baf1A and sorafenib not only
prevents tumor growth but promotes tumor regression.
Next we determined the effects of combinatorial
Baf1A and sorafenib treatment on tumor metastasis using

the same MDA-MB-231-luc xenografts. Metastasis were
determined by non-invasive luciferase as described in
Methods. Examples of metastatic localization and the
effect of drug treatment are shown in Figure 8C and D.
Metastases were found in the right and left lymph node,
the neck and the area of the lungs/thymus. Metastatic
quantification revealed that 82% of vehicle treated
mice exhibited 1 or more metastases. The number of
mice with metastasis was significantly reduced by both
Baf1A (5 out of 10 animals) and sorafenib (5 out of 10
animals) treatments. The number of metastasis was
further significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by the combined
treatment with only 1 of 8 mice displaying metastasis in

the sorafenib + Baf1A group (Figure 8E).

DISCUSSION
Our results show that treatment of hypoxic MCF7
and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with the V-ATPase
inhibitor Baf1A activated Bnip3-dependent cell death. The
effect was mimicked by knockdown of V-ATPase with a
selective siRNA and blocked by a Bnip3-selective siRNA.
A caspase independent programmed death pathway that
involves mitochondrial permeability transition was
implicated and is consistent with our previous results and

results from other laboratories [32, 33]. We hypothesize
that at least part of the mechanism of cell death involves
Bnip3 activation by intracellular acidosis. Baf1A
treatment also activated MAPK promoting survival and
this was countered by a combination treatment of Baf1A
and ERK 1/2 inhibition. The in vitro effects were well
replicated in vivo in breast cancer xenografts. Baf1A
treatment significantly blocked tumor growth and even
cause regression when delivered directly into the tumor.
Combination therapy with Baf1A and the MAPK inhibitor
sorafenib optimally inhibited tumor growth, conferred
tumor regression and reduced metastasis. These are the
first studies to show activation of the Bnip3 death pathway
by modulation of proton flux and its possible relevance to
the treatment of breast and possibly other cancers.
Hypoxic tumors are known to activate elaborate
defense mechanism specifically to evade Bnip3–mediated
death. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer
Bnip3 transcription is prevented by hypermethylation of
the Bnip3 promoter [40, 41]. In glioblastoma and nonsmall lung carcinomas Bnip3 protein is sequestered
in the nuclei where it may actually block apoptosis by
suppressing transcription of the apoptosis-inducing factor
(AIF) and death receptor 5 (DR5) genes [42, 43]. Our
studies suggest a third mechanism whereby intracellular
acidosis is avoided and Bnip3 in hypoxic regions is
maintained in a latent state through the aggressive
extrusion of protons by the V-ATPase pump. Hypoxic
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells remained fully viable
during 72 hrs of severe hypoxia despite the expression of
Bnip3. Loss of cell viability and Bnip3-dependent death
was only evident after treatment with Baf1A. Knock-down
of Bnip3 with siRNA reversed Baf1A induced cell death.
These results are consistent with our previous result that
described Bnip3 death pathway mediated by hypoxiaacidosis in cardiac myocytes and confirm a requirement
of increase intracellular acidosis to activate cell death by
Bnip3 [31, 32]. The results are also consistent with other
reports that elevated Bnip3 alone does not induce death or
autophagy in hypoxic cells [44] [45].
Baf1A treatment was found to increase the
phosphorylation levels of the mitogen activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways including JNK,
p38 and ERK. The ras/raf/ERK signaling pathway is of
particular interest since one or more mutations in proteins
associated with this pathway has been found in many types
of cancers [46]. Unlike JNK and p38 that may assist in
Baf1A induced cell death, ERK activation was protective.
Consequently ERK inhibition synergized with Baf1A to
enhance toxicity and promote cell death. ERK was found
to phosphorylate the proapoptotic protein Bim targeting it
for degradation, and caused increased phosphorylation of
p90RSK. P90RSK has been shown to positively regulate
the activity of the Na+-H+ exchanger an activity that may
contribute to pH regulation [37, 47]. Therefore ERK
activation exerts a dual survival response to block Bnip3www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mediated death by enhancing pH regulation and blocking
Bim-mediated death by proteosomal targeting.
To determine therapeutic potential of Baf1A on
tumor growth in vivo we used xenograft models of
moderately aggressive non-metastatic breast cancer
(MCF7) and highly aggressive metastatic breast cancer
(MDA-MB-231). Baf1A reduced the rate of tumor growth
by ~50% in each of the xenograft models. Importantly,
we observed no toxic side effects of Baf1A at the
concentration used. This is in agreement with other studies
that have examined Baf1A on tumor growth [48, 49]. The
therapeutic effects of Baf1A were significantly enhanced
by the addition of the ERK inhibitor sorafenib.
Tumor metastasis is a critical factor in cancer
patient morbidity and is becoming increasingly linked
to extracellular acidification [50-52]. In metastatic
breast cancer cells both migration and invasiveness
are increased when the cells are exposed to acidic
conditions [53, 54]. Inhibition of the V-ATPase with
Baf1A is able to reduce the migration and invasiveness
of cancer cells in vitro suggesting a direct role for the
V-ATPase in tumor metastasis [20]. In rapidly dividing
metastatic breast cancer cells the V-ATPase is localized
to the plasma membrane whereas in less aggressive breast
cancer cells the V-ATPase is localized to the lysosomes
[20]. Using the highly aggressive and metastatic breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB-231-luc, we observed a 50%
reduction in the number of metastatic tumors in the
presence of Baf1A alone that was further reduced by
the combination of Baf1A and sorafenib. It has been
proposed that proton extrusion by the V-ATPase produces
a permissive environment for tumor cell metastasis by
regulating protease digestion of the extracellular matrix,
by increasing tumor cell growth and migration, and by
increasing angiogenesis [55-57] [58].
Breast cancer treatment is largely determined by the
stage and characteristics of the tumor. Treatment strategies
include mastectomy and lumpectomy usually followed by
radiation, chemo and hormone therapy. In most of these
cases the acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironments
negatively impact the success of these treatments by
inducing radiation and chemotherapy resistance and by
selecting cells with enhanced metastatic phenotypes
[59-61]. However, the majority of breast cancer cells
and cancers cells in general may hold the keys to their
own demise in the expression of the hypoxia regulated
apoptotic protein Bnip3. We believe that our results
warrant further studies on combination therapy focused
on maximal Bnip3 activation in the hypoxic zone, and
blockade of compensatory pathways by which the tumor
cells evade such death. The targeting of hypoxic tumor
cells is particularly exciting because these are the cells that
confer resistance to radiation and chemotherapy and may
in fact harbor tumor stem cells capable of regenerating the
entire tumor [62] [63].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

siRNA treatment:

RPMI Medium, and Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) were
purchased from Gibco/Life Technologies (Grand Island,
NY). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted.

Bnip3 and V-ATPase proteins were knocked down
as previously described [64] using protein specific siRNA
obtained from Dharmacon (Thermo Scientific). Cells were
transfected overnight with 10 nM Bnip3 siRNA, or 20,
50, or 100 nM V-ATPase siRNA or random sequence
siRNA using DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell culture:
Human breast cancer cells MCF7, and MDAMB-231 were purchased from ATCC. MDA-MB231-lucerifase cells were purchased from Cell Biolabs
Incorporated. Cells were maintained in RPMI media
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin.

Cell transfection:
Cells were transfected with vectors expressing GFP,
Bnip3 or Bnip3 transmembrane deletion mutant using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) [32]. After 6 hr the
transfection media was removed and the cells imaged 48
hr following Baf1A treatment.

Xenografts:

Caspase 3 activity:

All animal protocols were approved and conducted
in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and
use of animals. Xenografts were generated using MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231-luciferase human breast cancer cells.
Subconfluent cultures where trypsinized and resuspended
in cool RPMI and Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical) at
a 1:2 ratio. Xenografts were generated by injecting 0.1 ml
of Matrigel/medium mixture containing 5 x 106 cells into
the right flank of nude mice (Charles River Laboratory).
Tumor volumes were determined by measuring tumor
length and width with calipers and the tumor volume
determined using the formula L x W2/2. Once the tumor
volumes reached 100 mm3, the animals were divided
into randomly assigned treatment groups receiving either
1) vehicle, 2) 1mg/kg nM Baf1A administered every
two days in a volume of 0.1 ml, 3) 40 mg/kg sorafenib
administered daily by gavage, or 4) Baf1A + sorafenib
administered as described above. In certain experiments
mice were injected with 150 mg/kg luciferin and the tumor
burden and metastasis visualized using a Xenogen IVIS200 imaging system (UM Oncogenomics Core facility).

Caspase 3 activity was determined using a
fluorometric assay from R&D systems, as per the
manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed using a Victor
1420 Multilabel counter.

Cell death assays:
Cell death was determined by trypan blue extrusion
as previously described and by lactate dehydrogenase
release using a commercially available kit (Roche).

Subcellular fractionation:
Cells were fractionated as previously described [33].
In brief, after treatment, cells were washed with PBS and
suspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 320 mM sucrose,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors and homogenized using a teflon-glass
homogenizer. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged
at 1,500 x g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet the nuclei and
unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged
at 10,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C to pellet mitochondria.

Hypoxia:
Cells were exposed to hypoxia using a BioTrace
anaerobic chamber as previously described [32]. Chamber
oxygen concentration was continually monitored and
maintained at 0.5% oxygen with 5% carbon dioxide. To
insure adequate glucose concentrations during hypoxia,
cell culture media was supplemented with 10 mM glucose.
Cells were lysed under hypoxia using ice-cold hypoxic
buffers.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blot analysis:
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and western blots
performed as previously described [64]. Western blot
densitometry was determined using Image J software
from NIH. Western blot analysis was performed using
antibodies to Bnip3 (Abcam), V-ATPase (EMD Millipore),
PUMA, NOXA, Bim, Mcl-xl, Bcl-2, Bak (Cell Signaling
Technologies), cytochrome c (Pharmingen), ICAD (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), α-fodrin (Chemicon International),
