Similar Exponential Process in Advanced Cancers

Abstract
Successful cancer treatments are generally deﬁned as those that decrease tumor quantity. In many cases, this
decrease occurs exponentially, with deviations from a strict exponential being attributed to a growing fraction of
drug-resistant cells. Deviations from an exponential decrease in tumor quantity can also be expected if drugs have
a nonuniform spatial distribution inside the tumor, for example, because of interstitial pressure inside the tumor.
Here, we examine theoretically different models of cell killing and analyze data from clinical trials based on these
models. We show that the best description of clinical outcomes is by ﬁrst-order kinetics with exponential decrease
of tumor quantity. We analyzed the total tumor quantity in a diverse group of clinical trials with various cancers
during the administration of different classes of anticancer agents and in all cases observed that the models that
best ﬁt the data describe the decrease of the sensitive tumor fraction exponentially. The exponential decrease
suggests that all drug-sensitive cancer cells have a single rate-limiting step on the path to cell death. If there are
intermediate steps in the path to cell death, they are not rate limiting in the observational time scale utilized in
clinical trials—tumor restaging at 6- to 8-week intervals. On shorter time scales, there might be intermediate
steps, but the rate-limiting step is the same. Our analysis, thus, points to a common pathway to cell death for
cancer cells in patients.

Introduction
In a landmark paper published in Cancer Research in 1964
that described a mouse leukemia model, Skipper formulated
two laws of tumor kinetics that have been inﬂuential in
designing treatment schedules and combination therapies
(1, 2). The ﬁrst law states that dividing cancer cells if left
undisturbed grow exponentially. The second law states that
when treated with a ﬁxed amount of a therapy, the fraction of
cancer cells killed remains the same irrespective of the total
number of cancer cells. Although the cellular mechanism of the
ﬁrst law can be traced to symmetric cancer cell division, the
molecular roots of the second law are still unknown. For
example, as a tumor becomes smaller one could expect a
larger fraction might be killed if a ﬁxed amount of a therapy

is being used, or if the drug is not uniformly distributed in a
tumor, one may anticipate that some parts of the tumor will be
more susceptible than others. The second law might also be in
conﬂict with the fact that tumors are heterogeneous. Recent
evidence highlighting the genetic diversity of tumors (3) suggests that the cells comprising a tumor have different susceptibilities to killing by a given therapy. Therefore, one might
argue a less susceptible fraction is left behind, and the fraction
of cells killed with the same dose should decrease with each
consecutive drug administration. In agreement with Skipper
(Fig. 1), we have previously shown through analysis of tumor
measurements obtained from patients that tumor growth
occurs exponentially and that the rate of this exponential
growth is constant (4–8). The rates are far slower than those
of the leukemia models used by Skipper, but the exponential
nature of growth was conﬁrmed. We have further shown that in
patients with advanced metastatic cancer, the growth rate
constant correlates well with overall survival. Although these
data have additionally suggested that the regression of tumors
is also exponential, we wished to examine other possibilities for
the regression of tumor, given the existence of numerous
proposed models of how therapies affect tumors. To do this,
we mathematically modeled the occurrence of cancer cell
death in several ways and analyzed tumor measurements or
biomarker data from clinical trials in which a diverse group of
anticancer agents was studied in advanced cancers. In analyzing data from these trials, we will show that although the
therapies are mechanistically different, ranging, for example,
from microtubule-targeting agents to activated T cells, in all

cases, the sensitive tumor cells disappear exponentially. We
propose, based on general mathematical grounds, that there is
a common feature by which cells die when treated with
anticancer agents.

Results
We present three theoretical models: (i) a "constant fraction
or exponential model," where a constant fraction of cells is
killed with each drug administration; (ii) a "constant number
model," where a constant number of cells are killed with each
treatment; and (iii) a "tumor surface model," where only
(principally) cells on the surface of the tumor are killed with
each treatment (Fig. 2). All three models can be analyzed using
a simple mathematical approach.
To obtain a relation between the number of sensitive cells
and time, we can express at some point of time the relation
between the number of sensitive cells at that time and at a time
shortly before that time. If the number of cancer cells in the
tumor is N then
N ðat time t þ DtÞ
¼ N ðat time tÞ  Nkilled ðbetween time t and t þ DtÞ; ð1Þ
where Nkilled is the number of cells killed by a therapy during
time interval Dt. For the three models then, we have the
following:

www.aacrjournals.org

*

Constant fraction or exponential model: Nkilled in any time
interval Dt during treatment is Dt f N, where f is a
fraction of the total number of cells (N) in the tumor at
time t. The fraction f N is the number of cells killed per
unit time and is proportional to the total number of cells
in the tumor.
Constant number model: Nkilled in any time interval Dt
during treatment is Dt C, where C is the number of
cells killed per unit time. Nkilled in time interval Dt is
constant and is "independent of the number of cells
in the tumor," being dependent only on the time
interval Dt.
Tumor surface model: Nkilled is the number of cells on the
surface of the tumor and if we assume that the tumor is
spherical we can obtain an expression for the relation
between the fraction of cells on the surface of the tumor and
the total number of cells in the tumor (see the
Supplementary Information).

One can cast the three models in a differential form by
using DN to mean the change in cell number during time
Dt, with N as the total number of cells at the outset. The
equations describing the three models are:

Constant fraction or exponential model, where the same
fraction of cells is killed with each treatment and the number
is that fraction:

In each of the three cases, the number on the right-hand side
is different and it depends on the details of the model. However,
the details do not alter the fact that:
*

*

*

In the constant fraction or exponential model, this number,
representing the fraction of tumor killed, multiplies the ﬁrst
power of the total cell number (N) in the tumor.
In the constant number model, the right-hand side contains
only a number.
In the tumor surface model, the number multiplies the twothird power of the total number of cells (N) in the tumor.

We have assumed that the rate at which a therapy kills
cells does not vary with time. This might not be the case. For
example, combination therapies with antiangiogenic drugs
that possibly normalize the vasculature should be expected
to lead to changes in the rate of killing. Reducing angiogenesis could starve the tumor of nutrients and also have a
negative effect on the delivery of a therapy, thus slowing the
kill rate, or normalization of leaky blood vessels with a
decrease in their tortuosity could improve blood ﬂow so
that delivery of a therapy to the tumor improves, increasing
kill rate.
The number of cells in a tumor correlates with its volume.
Given this, the solutions of the equations describing the three
models are displayed in Fig. 3A:

*

*

*

In the constant fraction or exponential model, the volume
decreases exponentially with time.
In the constant number model, the volume decreases linearly
with time.
In the tumor surface model, the volume decreases as the
third power.

Often the sum of the longest measured linear distances or
the longest diameters of the radiographically assessed tumor
are used as a criterion for response as described in RECIST. In
this case, the solutions of the equations describing the three
models are displayed in Fig. 3B:
*

4656

In the constant fraction or exponential model, the (sum of
the) longest diameter still decreases exponentially but with
one third of the rate.

Cancer Res; 74(17) September 1, 2014

In the constant number model, the (sum of the) longest
diameter of the tumor decreases as the cubic root of time.
In the tumor surface model the (sum of the) longest diameter
of the tumor decreases linearly in time.

Given the above theoretical models, we examined data from
a diverse group of clinical trials to investigate how different
therapies affect tumors—speciﬁcally how these different therapies bring about regression of tumors. In most patients, the
tumor ﬁrst shrinks at the start of treatment and after reaching
a minimum, increases in size, as drug resistant cells comprise
an increasingly larger fraction of the tumor. We have shown
and reported previously that growth of the resistant fraction is
well modeled as an exponential, which we have estimated with
the growth rate constant, g (4–8). Whether the resistant
fraction preexists before therapy begins, or resistance is
acquired after therapy has begun, there will be a time when
the sensitive cells are continuing to be killed while the resistant
cells are growing. The exponentially growing fraction of cells
also exists during that part of the time course, corresponding to
a decrease in the overall tumor size—a decrease that is
occurring because the quantity of tumor being killed is still
greater than the quantity growing exponentially, so the net
result is the reduction in size. Because these two processes are
occurring concurrently, we include in our analysis of the killing
process, the exponentially growing fraction in each model as
described below. The equations that describe the tumor volume (number of cells) and the longest diameter of the tumor
are shown in Table 1.
The constants f, d, and g are estimated from the data of
quantities of tumor obtained while a patient receives a given
therapy. The data are either measurements of the longest
diameter of tumor masses seen radiographically or the values
of serum markers recorded as treatment is administered and
response is assessed. Note that the exponential model is
described by the same equation whether volume or diameter
is used. The fraction or proportion of the initial tumor that is
sensitive to treatment and will eventually decay or regress is
represented by f and is to be distinguished from the fraction
that is killed with each cycle of treatment. The decay or
regression rate constant represented by d describes the rate at
which the fraction of tumor that is sensitive to the therapy is
disappearing. The growth rate constant represented by g
describes the rate at which the fraction of tumor that is
resistant or relatively resistant to the therapy is growing, and
as we have discussed, this growth occurs exponentially.
Finally, the fraction of the initial tumor that is resistant or
relatively resistant to the therapy is equal to (1  f), given
that f has been deﬁned as the fraction of the initial tumor
that is sensitive to the therapy. All the analyses of the killing
process include the exponentially growing fraction (1  f)
egt, where (1  f) is the fraction of the tumor resistant or
relatively resistant to the therapy in each model. Although the
constant fraction or exponential model represents the exponential decrease we have reported before (4–8), the other two
models—constant number and tumor surface—represent
nonexponential models.

measures of tumor quantity. The data from each individual
patient was ﬁt to all equations in Table 1. The results of this
attempt, summarized in Table 2, show the one equation that
best ﬁt each dataset from 2,027 patients. In actual practice, we
analyze the constant fraction (exponential) equation more
accurately than shown in Table 1—with four derivations (4–
8) that appear in Table 2 as dx, gx, gd, and g þ d þ . In cases
where growth was not detected—only tumor shrinkage—the
equation simpliﬁes to edt (dx in Table 2), given no growth has
occurred and the exponential growth portion of the equation,
egt, can be ignored. Similarly, where only tumor growth without
shrinkage was observed, the equation simpliﬁes to egt (gx
in Table 2), the exponential decay portion of the equation,
edt, having been removed. The terms gd and g þ d þ  refer to
the equations used in cases, where there is simultaneous
occurrence of an exponential decrease of the sensitive tumor
fraction and an exponential increase of the resistant or relatively resistant tumor fraction. The full equation, termed g þ d
þ  in Table 2 and shown in Table 1 as [f edt þ (1  f) egt],
includes , the fraction of cells sensitive to the therapy and (1 
) the fraction of cells resistant or relatively resistant to the
therapy. The gd model is a simpliﬁed version that is a sum of
the two exponentials. From the data in Table 2, it is clear that
models with exponential tumor regression best ﬁt the data for
widely different treatments. Examples of such best ﬁts are
depicted in Fig. 4, which shows individual patient tumor
measurement data modeled by the equations listed for each
ﬁgure. As can be seen in Table 2, the various forms of the
exponential equations modeled the data best in more than 80%
of patients. The same is true if one limits the analysis to only
those 385 cases where tumor regression without growth was
observed. In this group, the data from 361 (93%) were ﬁt best by
the exponential equation. Six examples of exponential regression are depicted in the top two rows of Fig. 4, with three
examples of patient data ﬁtting the nonexponential regression
equations shown in the bottom row.

Discussion
We have discussed several models that describe how cell
death could occur when a treatment is applied to a cancer.
Analysis of data from various clinical trials suggests that
models (equations), in which the regression or decay of tumor
occurs exponentially, best describe the rate of cell death in
human tumors. These results establish, in a diverse group of
human cancers treated with a diverse group of therapies, the
validity of Skipper's original observation in an L1210 leukemia
model, albeit at a much slower rate (1, 2). An exponential

decrease in the quantity of tumor cells means that with each
successive treatment the same fraction of cells is killed every
time.
Exponential decay is observed in one step in radioactive
decay, where the probability for decay of an unstable element
to another stable element is unchanged as time passes (18). If
the decay is not exponential, either the substance is a mixture
of elements that have different decay rates or the elements
decay into intermediate states, which in turn decay to the ﬁnal
stable element. In this latter case, the decay is not exponential
in time, but a sum of exponentials on a time scale. If all
transition rates are the same, the model can be solved explicitly
as shown in the Supplementary Information. In this case, the
solution is described by a power of time multiplied by an
exponential (19). Another biologic phenomena in which a
fractional or exponential kill occurs is with antibiotics and
bacteria (20). In this case, the quantity of viable bacteria also
decreases exponentially with each drug application. In contrast, nonexponential laws, reﬂecting the existence of more
than one rate-limiting process have been observed in the case
of the age dependence of cancer incidence (19, 21). In this case,
more than one gene mutation is needed for cancer to occur and
the incidence curves are not exponential but rather are
described by power laws.
The data analyzed here, showing tumor regression in most
cases occurs exponentially, argues against the existence of an
intermediate step in the process of cell death. This does not
mean cells that are damaged cannot repair their damage and
rejoin the viable fraction. This is shown in Fig. 5, where each
treatment damages some cells, a fraction of which die while the
remaining repair the damage and rejoin the viable fraction. In
the latter case, if the fraction that repairs the damage is
constant, then cell death occurs exponentially. It also does
not mean only one molecular event occurs before cell death. A
complex set of events might take place, but these must always
lead to cells that are either fully viable or dead, that is, the
ensuing treatment begins from the same initial state as the
previous treatment administration. That there is no intermediate step may be a consequence of the doses used with cancer
therapies; if these doses are always administered at high
enough amounts, then the different steps required for cell
death are accomplished within one treatment. This seems
unlikely given the observation of exponential cell death with
a myriad of drugs and with modalities other than drugs. But if
the reason an intermediate step is not "detected" is because
doses are excessive, then a deviation from exponential or
fractional cell death would be an indication the treatment is
insufﬁcient in quantity.

Cancer Research: Physics in Cancer Research
Figure 4. Examples of individual data from nine different patients' "best ﬁt" to any of the seven models discussed in the text and summarized in Table 2.

Our data also imply that although a tumor may be
composed of cells harboring different mutations and expressing crucial genes at different levels, the cells in tumor die
through a common pathway. This conclusion is reached,
because if different pathways existed and the rates of cell
death for each of pathways were different, the decrease of
the tumor quantity would be nonexponential. This does not
mean cells in all tumors must die in the same way. Cells in a
lymphoma or a testicular cancer may die as a result of

4660

Cancer Res; 74(17) September 1, 2014

apoptosis, whereas cells in another solid tumor die via a
different pathway. Alternately all cancer cells in all tumors
could die via apoptosis, only at varying rates. In this scenario, the rate-limiting step could be cytochrome C release
or caspase activation. Thus, the original observations of
Skipper on the L1210 leukemia model suggesting meaningful
increases in survival depended on increasing the fraction of
tumor cells that die following treatment is more relevant for
solid tumors than we have considered in recent years. If we

Figure 5. Three scenarios of treatment action. In the scenario shown in the top, a treatment affects a constant fraction of 30% of cells (red) and these die. In the
scenario depicted in the middle, some of the treatment-affected cells (green) repair their damage, rejoin the viable tumor cell pool, and continue contributing to
the growth of the tumor, reducing the fraction of cells killed to 20%. Here, drug-resistant cells that increase cell number irrespective of treatment are
not shown. Also the sensitive cells (blue) are assumed not to be dividing between treatments. Data obtained at the next assessment cannot distinguish
between these two possibilities and only captures the net regression rate. In the bottom, a scenario in which a constant (18) number of cells are killed
each time the treatment is administered. With the ﬁrst treatment, the same number of cells was killed, but subsequently the cells were killed at increasingly
larger proportions in the bottom scenario, because the number of cells that were killed stayed the same, whereas in the top and middle scenarios,
the number of cells killed decreased in time.

kill the same fraction of tumor cells at each step, the data
imply that we must increase that fraction—a very old
concept, but one now supported by actual patient data.
In summary, we have discussed several models of cell death
following treatment of human cancers. We have analyzed data
from a diverse group of clinical trials and demonstrate that in
patients treated with diverse therapies, cell death occurs
preferentially in an exponential manner. A corollary of this
exponential cell death is that there can be no intermediate with

www.aacrjournals.org

a signiﬁcantly different rate-limiting step in the occurrence of
cell death; cells are not incrementally damaged by successive
therapies but rather, having been damaged by a therapy, either
die or repair the damage. A second corollary is that cell death in
a tumor follows a common pathway. Together with previous
analyses demonstrating exponential growth as the preferred
pattern of tumor growth, we hope this information can be used
to better understand how therapies work and how to make
them better.
