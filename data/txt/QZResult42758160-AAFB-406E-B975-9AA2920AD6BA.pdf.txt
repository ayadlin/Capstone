Melanoma is a neoplasm with a rising incidence. Early-stage melanoma is curable, but advanced, metastatic melanoma almost uniformly is fatal, and patients
with such advanced disease have a short median survival. Systemic therapy
remains unsatisfactory, inducing complete durable responses in a small minority

atients with metastatic melanoma have a short median survival,
generally in the range of only 6 to 9 months in most reported
series. Systemic therapy induces complete durable responses in a
very small minority of patients.1 Most discouragingly, the median
survival has not improved appreciably despite decades of investigations of cytotoxic, immunologic, and now molecularly targeted
agents. In this review, we have focused on the current role of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and
the future prospects for improvements for multiagent chemotherapy
and chemotherapy combined with immunomodulatory and/or

Dacarbazine and Temozolomide
Single-agent chemotherapy produces objective response rates of
<20%. However, a few patients—most of them with metastases to
the skin, soft tissue, lymph nodes, or lungs and a good performance
status as well as normal blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme
levels (International Union Against Cancer/American Joint Committee on Cancer M1a and M1b)—achieve long-term disease control
with a good quality of life, and some of them may achieve a cure.2
Historically, dacarbazine (DTIC) has produced response rates of
from 15% to 25% in single-institution trials with median response
durations of 5 to 6 months, but <5% of responses are complete.3
Long-term follow-up of patients treated with DTIC alone shows that
<2% can be anticipated to survive for 6 years. However, in recent

Phase III trials that used strict response assessment
criteria, the response rates with single-agent DTIC
did not exceed 12%.4–7 It has been demonstrated that
single doses of DTIC (850–1000 mg/m2) are tolerated,
appear to deliver clinical improvements similar to
those observed with multiple doses that provide the
same total dose per cycle, and should be the reference standard for randomized trials comparing new
therapies with DTIC.8
DTIC remains the only currently used cytotoxic
drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma (hydroxyurea also was granted approval for the
treatment of this disease but has never been
employed widely). Despite its low single-agent activity, DTIC has remained the mainstay of many combination chemotherapy regimens; and evaluations of
resistance-reversing agents, and despite >20 years of
research, it is remains the standard against which
most new chemotherapy agents are compared.
A closely related agent is temozolomide (TMZ),
an oral congener of DTIC that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of variety of solid tumors,
especially in brain malignancies, which is a manifestation of its far greater ability to penetrate the central
nervous system (CNS). Taking into account the high
rate of CNS recurrence as a site of failure after cytotoxic chemotherapy, TMZ may represent a viable alternative to DTIC, which is ineffective against CNS
metastases, even if the single-agent efficacy in nonCNS disease is similar for both drugs.9 The singleagent activity of TMZ in metastatic melanoma has
been established in several Phase I/II studies.10,11 In
a randomized trial of 305 patients with advanced
melanoma, TMZ showed efficacy at least equivalent
to that of DTIC in terms of objective response rate,
time to progression, and overall and disease-free survival.5 in that study, the median survival was 7.7
months for patients who received TMZ and 6.4
months for patients who received DTIC. The median
progression-free survival essentially was identical in
the TMZ-treated group (1.9 months) and the DTICtreated group (1.5 months). Overall, TMZ was tolerated very well and showed an advantage in terms of
improvement in the quality of life. More patients
showed improvement or maintenance of physical
functioning at Week 12. That trial excluded patients
who had brain metastases. Because the trial design
was intended to demonstrate the superiority of TMZ
over DTIC, rather than equivalence, the FDA did not
accept the results of that trial as grounds for approving a melanoma indication for TMZ.
There are suggestions that the administration of
TMZ in multiple doses per day or as a prolonged

daily administration may overcome some chemotherapy drug-resistance mechanisms. The rationale
for those suggestions lies in an evaluation of recent
data on the mechanism of action of TMZ. Five-(3methyltriazen-1-y) imidazole-4-carboximide, which is
the active metabolite of DTIC and the end product
of spontaneous metabolism of TMZ, methylates guanine residues in DNA at the O6 position.10 Increased
levels of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (ATase)
are associated with resistance to agents that produce
O6 methylation (DTIC, TMZ, and nitrosoureas). Administration of TMZ results in decreased ATase activity within 4 hours of an oral dose that persists in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells for at least
24 hours.12 Daily administration resulted in the progressive depletion of ATase activity over the 5 days of
treatment. Thus, on each day of treatment, there is
increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of TMZ
resulting from the decrease in ATase activity induced
by the prior day’s chemotherapy. Currently, there is
an ongoing trial by the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) comparing DTIC with prolonged daily administration of
TMZ. The extended dose of TMZ (75 mg/m2 per day)
administered for 6 weeks followed by a 2-week rest is
tolerated well and may be used in patients who have
a borderline performance status. Other agents that
lower ATase are Lomeguatrib (Patrin, PM), which is
an orally bioavailable, highly potent O6-MeG analog
that is tolerated well as a singe agent13 and poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor.14

Other Single Agents
Cisplatin and carboplatin have shown modest activity as single agents in patients with metastatic melanoma. Cisplatin as single-agent therapy induced a
15% response rate with a short median duration of 3
months.1,15 Evidence that the activity of cisplatin
may be dose-dependent has come from single-institution studies. Doses up to 150 mg/m2 in combination with amifostine produced tumor responses in
53% of patients.16 However, all of those responses
were partial, and the median response duration was
only 4 months. In a randomized Phase II study of
cisplatin and WR-2721 versus cisplatin in 94 patients,
the response rates were 23.3% and 16.3%, respectively, and the median survival was 7.58 months.17 A
response rate of 19% has been reported in 26 chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic melanoma
who received carboplatin. In those patients, there
were 5 partial responses, and thrombocytopenia was
the dose-limiting toxicity.18 Oxaliplatin has yet to be
tested extensively in patients with melanoma.
Although in vitro studies have suggested that it may

Chemotherapy for Metastatic Melanoma/Gogas et al.

be more active than cisplatin or carboplatin,19 a
small Phase II trial in 10 patients who had received
and failed prior chemotherapy produced no objective
responses.20
The nitrosoureas (carmustine, lomustine [CCNU],
and semustine [methyl-CCNU]) induce objective responses in from 13% to 18% of patients. They cross
the blood-brain barrier; however, at conventional
doses, little or no activity was observed against melanoma brain metastases.1,15,21 Furthermore, the nitrosureas induce prolonged myelosuppression. Despite
this, they have been included frequently in multiagent
chemotherapy regimens, presumably for their ability
to penetrate into the CNS. Fotemustine is probably
the most active nitrosourea in metastatic melanoma. It
has been tested in 5 Phase II trials on 351 patients
with response rates of 20% to 25% and complete
response rates of 5% to 8%.22–26 Fotemustine was the
first drug to show significant efficacy in brain metastases, but it never has been widely available in the
United States.
The vinca alkaloids, particularly vindesine and
vinblastine, have produced responses in approximately 14% of patients,27 and the taxanes have produced responses in from 16% to 17% of patients.28–30
None of those drugs have been evaluated as single
agents in Phase III trials; however, based on the experience with DTIC, it is likely that the Phase III trial
objective response rates for all of them would be less
than the rates reported from the various small Phase
II trials that have been conducted to date. All of
these drugs are rarely used currently as single-agent
therapy in metastatic melanoma, but they frequently
have been incorporated into combination chemotherapy and biochemotherapy regimens. Finally, a
potentially active new drug is ABI-007 (abraxane),
which is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation
of paclitaxel with an improved therapeutic index. It
has been tested in a Phase II trial in 37 previously
treated and chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic melanoma and produced a >30% overall
response rate. ABI-002 will now be explored in a randomized Phase III trial.31

COMBINATION CHEMOTHERAPY
Because single-agent chemotherapy regimens have
demonstrated only modest activity in the treatment
of metastatic melanoma, in an attempt to improve
response rates, many combination regimens have
been evaluated in clinical trials. Although it is legitimate to question the advantages that may accrue
from the use of multiple agents with minimal singleagent activity and no laboratory or clinical evidence

457

of synergistic interactions, the lack of viable alternatives drove the conduct of these trials more than any
biologic rationale. Initially, 2-agent regimens were
used in which DTIC was combined with a nitrosourea, vinka alkaloid, or platinum compound. In
most of those trials, response rates from 10% to 20%
were observed, and there was little evidence to suggest superiority to single-agent DTIC.32–36
After those disappointing results, investigations
of more aggressive, multiagent regimens were conducted. Phase II studies of 3- and 4-drug combinations generally produced response rates that ranged
from 30% to 50% in single-institution studies. Two of
the most widely studied combinations are cisplatin,
vinblastine, and DTIC (CVD) and the Dartmouth regimen. The 3-drug combination CVD that was developed by Legha et al at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center produced responses in 40%
of 50 patients, a 4% complete response rate, and a
median response duration of 9 months.37 However,
in a randomized trial comparing CVD with singleagent DTIC that involved approximately 150 patients,
the CVD arm produced a 19% response rate compared with 14% for the DTIC arm, and there was no
differences in either response duration or survival.38
The 4-drug combination of cisplatin, DTIC, carmustine, and tamoxifen (CBDT), also called the Dartmouth regimen, produced responses in 46% of 141
patients (16 complete responses and 49 partial
responses). The median response duration was 7
months.39 The authors suggested that the inclusion
of tamoxifen was essential, with response rates of
10% for the 3 cytotoxic drugs in the same doses
when tamoxifen was omitted.40 However, a randomized Phase III trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada that compared CBDT with
cisplatin, DTIC, and carmustine (CBD) produced a
response rate of 30% for the CDBT arm compared
with 21% for the CBD arm (P ¼ .187). In fact, twice
as many patients achieved a complete remission in
the CBD group compared with the group that
received tamoxifen (6% vs 3%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .33).
However, in that study, more patients in the tamoxifen group achieved a partial remission (27% vs
14%). This difference was of borderline significance
(P ¼ .05). Gender did not seem to be a factor: The
response rate and the median survival for women in
the tamoxifen group did not differ statistically compared from those for women in the chemotherapyalone group. Similarly, there was no difference
between men in the treatment groups. Progressionfree survival and overall survival did not differ significantly between the 2 arms (P ¼ .86 and P ¼ .52,

458

CANCER

respectively).41 In another randomized Phase III trial,
the CDBT combination was compared with singleagent DTIC. That cooperative group trial involved
240 patients, and the response rate was 10.2% for the
DTIC regimen compared with 18.5% for the CDBT
regimen (P ¼ .09). The median survival was 7 months,
with no significant difference between the 2 treatment arms. Toxicity was substantially greater for the
combination regimen, with bone marrow suppression,
nausea, emesis, and fatigue significantly more frequent with CDBT than with DTIC.42 Taken together,
to date, controlled trials have produced no compelling evidence to support the value of combination
chemotherapy, with or without tamoxifen, in patients
with metastatic melanoma. It is difficult to justify the
use of either CVD or CBDT instead of single-agent
DTIC or TMZ for the treatment of most patients with
metastatic melanoma.

COMBINATIONS OF CHEMOTHERAPY WITH
IMMUNOMODULATORY OR HORMONAL AGENTS
Tamoxifen and Interferon a
Similar to investigations of multiagent cytotoxic
chemotherapy, combinations of cytotoxic drugs that
have minimal efficacy with immunomodulatory or
hormonal agents have been investigated despite the
lack of a compelling rationale. The results of adding
tamoxifen to CBD chemotherapy were discussed
above; however, tamoxifen also has been added to
single-agent DTIC in several studies. Results from a
small, randomized trial of DTIC without or with tamoxifen indicated that combination therapy may be
more effective.43 A response rate of 28% and a median survival of 41 weeks were reported for patients
who received DTIC plus tamoxifen compared with a
response rate of only 12% and a median survival of
23 weeks for patients who received DTIC alone.
Similar results were reported with the combination of DTIC plus interferon a (IFN-a). In a small,
randomized trial that compared DTIC without or
with IFN-a2b, the combination therapy produced 12
complete responses and 4 partial responses in 30
patients compared with only 2 complete responses
and 4 partial responses among 30 patients who
received DTIC.44 The median response and survival
were prolonged significantly for the DTIC plus IFNa2b arm in that trial. To further evaluate the potential benefits of combining DTIC with either tamoxifen, or IFN-a, or both, the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a 4-arm, 2  2,
factorial design, Phase III trial that failed to confirm
the initial encouraging observations.4 The overall
response rate in that trial (ECOG 3690) was 18%

(range, 12–21% for the 4 arms), and the median time
to treatment failure was 2.6 months. The median survival was identical (9.1 months) for all 4 arms tested.
In that trial, there was no advantage in terms of
response or survival attributable to the addition of
IFN-a2b, tamoxifen, or both agents to DTIC. In a
recent meta-analysis of 6 published, randomized trials
that combined a total of 912 patients who were randomized to receive chemotherapy or biochemotherapy with or without tamoxifen, no improvements in
the rates of overall response, complete response, or
survival were demonstrated.45
Although results from early, limited, Phase II and
III trials suggested a benefit of tamoxifen, IFN-a2b,
or cisplatin when added to DTIC for patients with
metastatic disease, those benefits have not been confirmed in large-scale, multicenter, Phase III trials (Table 1). The main reason for such discrepancies
between the findings from single-institution studies
and the findings from large, multicenter, cooperative
trials probably is selection bias. Differences in performance status, percentages of patients with visceral
involvement, and number of metastatic sites easily
could account for some of the observed differences;
in fact, all of those factors are known to have an
impact on both response rate and survival.46

Thalidomide
It has been reported that the combination of a lowdose, daily schedule of TMZ with thalidomide has
significant clinical activity in patients with metastatic
melanoma.47 The overall objective response rate of
32% was higher than that achieved with TMZ alone,
and further study is warranted. However, the legacy
of failure left by prior attempts to combine cytotoxic
agents with immunodulators and other drugs in the
absence of a compelling biologic rationale suggests
that the combination of TMZ plus thalidomide
should not be accepted as a standard therapy until
and unless demonstrates superiority in Phase III
trials or at least until the high response rate can be
confirmed in larger, multi-institutional Phase II trials
using strict response assessment criteria. In addition,
it should be noted that, in a Phase II study of TMZ,
thalidomide, and whole-brain radiation therapy in
patients with brain metastases from melanoma that
was conducted by the Cytokine Working Group in 40
patients, no patient exhibited a systemic response.48
Biochemotherapy
In recent years, trials have evaluated the role of combination chemotherapy with other agents, such as
IFN-a and interleukin 2 (IL-2). Many investigators
have combined IL-2 with both IFN-a and chemo-

therapy in an attempt to improve both the response
rate and the percentage of durable complete remissions. A large body of data now exists demonstrating
that such biochemotherapy combinations can produce response rates in the range from 40% to 60%
with an approximately 10% complete response
rate.49–51 Durable remissions exceeding 5 years were
achieved by approximately 5% to 10% of patients.
Recurrences beyond the 2-year time point were
uncommon, thus suggesting that these patients who
exhibited durable responses may have achieved a
cure.51,52 However, many of the most active biochemotherapy regimens are associated with moderate to severe toxicity that has limited their broader
use and acceptance. Many trials have been performed in an attempt to identify biochemotherapy
regimens that may be administered in an outpatient
setting, with less toxicity, and using lower doses of
intravenous or subcutaneous IL-2.52,53 Unfortunately,
biochemotherapy regimens that involved low-dose,
subcutaneous IL-2 administration appeared to produce lower response rates than were observed generally with regimens that involved intravenous IL-2.53
Two meta-analyses of patients with metastatic
melanoma who were treated in studies that used various combinations of chemotherapy, biotherapy, or
biochemotherapy demonstrated an improvement in
response rates, but not in survival, with the use of
biochemotherapy. In a report by Keilholz et al,54
patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated
with IL-2/IFN-a/chemotherapy, IL-2/IFN-a without
chemotherapy, and IL-2/chemotherapy without IFNa regimens had response rates of 45%, 21%, and
15%, respectively. However, in that trial, survival did
not differ significantly between the groups (10.5
months), with 20% and 10% survival rates at 2 years
and 5 years, respectively, that did not differ among
the groups. In a second meta-analysis of combined
studies that involved 7711 patients with advanced

melanoma from 168 published trials, treatment with
an IL-2/IFN-a/chemotherapy combination resulted
in a significantly improved response rate compared
with treatment that used chemotherapy or IL-2based biotherapy.55
Although the results of those meta-analyses
speak for themselves, in the evidence-based treatment
of malignant melanoma, the superiority of biochemotherapy regimens to either IL-2-based immunotherapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy should be derived from
Phase III clinical trials; thus, 7 prospective, randomized studies in the United States and Europe evaluated aggressive biochemotherapeutic regimens that
contained IL-2 and IFN-a (Table 2). Those results
were inconsistent and were not compelling. However,
it is worthwhile describing several of the randomized
trials in more detail.
In a prospective European trial, 138 patients with
metastatic melanoma were randomized to receive
IFN and decreasing doses of IL-2 with or without cisplatin.56 The results of that trial demonstrated a significant increase in the response rate from 18% to
33% in the group that received biochemotherapy
compared to the group that received biotherapy and
an increase in progression-free survival from 53 days
to 92 days without any statistical differences in terms
of survival.
A second trial that was conducted by the EORTC
evaluated cisplatin, DTIC, and IFN-a with or without
IL-2.57 Evaluation of 363 treated patients demonstrated
no statistical improvement in response rate with the
addition of IL-2 (22.8% vs 20.8%, respectively) and in
progression-free survival (median, 3.0 months vs 3.9
months, respectively). The median survival was 9 months
in both arms, and the 2-year survival rate was 12.9%
and 17.6%, respectively (P ¼ .32). Another study that
was conducted by Rosenberg and colleagues58 at the
National Cancer Institute-Surgery Branch randomized
102 patients with stage IV melanoma to receive either

chemotherapy (DTIC, cisplatin, and tamoxifen) or biochemotherapy (IL-2, IFN-a, DTIC, cisplatin, and tamoxifen). Although the response rate in the
biochemotherapy arm (44%) was almost twice that of
the chemotherapy arm (27%), the difference was not
statistically significant (P ¼ .07). Furthermore, there
was a survival advantage in the chemotherapy arm
compared with the biochemotherapy arm (median
survival, 5.8 months in the biochemotherapy arm vs
10.7 months in the chemotherapy arm; P ¼ .05). There
has been speculation that this survival finding may
have been caused by the administration of high-dose
IL-2 as salvage therapy to a significant proportion of
the patients who failed to respond to chemotherapy
alone.
The study by Eton et al (CVD vs CVD with intravenous IL-2 and subcutaneous IFN-a) in 183 evaluable patients was the only one that demonstrated a
statistically significant advantage of biochemotherapy
over chemotherapy alone in terms of the response
rate (48% vs 25%, respectively), the complete response
rate (7% vs 2%, respectively), and the median time to
recurrence (4.9 months vs 2.4 months). A modest but
statistically significant increase in median overall
survival (11.9 months vs 9.2 months, respectively)
was observed.59
A large, Phase III trial that involved 482 patients
compared CVD chemotherapy with CVD plus intravenous IL-2 and subcutaneous IFN-a (a modified
version of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center’s concurrent biochemotherapy regimen; ECOG trial E3695). Important aspects of the
E3695 protocol were that it was large enough to distinguish clinically meaningful differences in survival
and durable responses and that it involved a population with a relatively large percentage of patients

who had prior IFN exposure in the adjuvant setting.
There were no statistically significant differences
between the chemotherapy and biochemotherapy
arms in response rates, progression-free survival, or
overall survival. It should be noted that there were
many inevaluable patients, many patients were not
treated according to the protocol, and more patients
were randomized to the biochemotherapy arm.60
Nonetheless, the conclusion from that and all randomized trials of biochemotherapy performed to date
was inescapable—that biochemotherapy should not
be used routinely outside of a clinical trial. However,
biochemotherapy may be useful in a symptomatic
patient with rapidly progressive disease to provide
symptomatic relief if high-dose IL-2 (FDA approved)
is not an option.

COMBINATIONS OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WITH TARGETED THERAPIES
The intrinsic resistance of melanoma to conventional
chemotherapy has led investigators to evaluate new
approaches such, as protein kinase inhibitors (eg,
sorafenib), agents that act on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or on apoptotic mechanisms (eg,
oblimersen sodium; previously referred to as G3139),
and antiangiogenic agents (eg, bevacizumab, SU5416,
MEDI-522, PI-88).

Sorafenib plus Chemotherapy
Sorafenib (Nexavar, previously referred to as BAY 439006) targets the adenosine triphosphate-binding site
of the BRAF kinase and inhibits both wild-type and
mutant BRAF in vitro. In addition, the spectrum of kinases inhibited by sorafenib includes CRAF, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 2, platelet-derived

Chemotherapy for Metastatic Melanoma/Gogas et al.

growth factor receptor b, p38, flt-3, and c-kit.61 Preclinical studies demonstrated a significant retardation in
the growth of human melanoma tumor xenografts
with sorafenib.62 In a Phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib as a single agent was established at 400 mg twice daily, and the most common
toxicities were gastrointestinal (mainly diarrhea), dermatologic (skin rash, hand-foot syndrome), and fatigue.63 In a Phase II trial that was conducted in 20
patients with refractory metastatic melanoma, sorafenib showed modest activity with 1 partial response
and 3 patients who achieved stable disease.64 In
another Phase II, randomized, discontinuation trial, no
objective responses were achieved, and 19% of
patients achieved stable disease.65 However, in a Phase
I/II study that combined carboplatin and paclitaxel
with escalating doses of sorafenib in 35 patients, a
promising response rate of 31% was observed, and
another 54% of patients experienced stable disease
that lasted 3 months.66 That study recently was
updated to include 105 patients, and the current
response rate is 27%. It is noteworthy that responses
to sorafenib have not been correlated to date with
BRAF mutation status.65 Responses were observed in
previously treated patients and in at least 1 patient with
a noncutaneous primary melanoma. A second Phase II
trial of the same regimen conducted at another institution (Vanderbilt University) yielded similarly promising
results (unpublished results). On this basis, 2 Phase III
trials have been launched to assess the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel plus sorafenib versus placebo in
chemotherapy-naive patients (E2603) and in previously
treated patients. Relatively little is known about the inherent activity of carboplatin and paclitaxel as systemic
therapy for patients with stage IV melanoma, particularly at the doses employed in the Phase II trial and,
now, in the Phase III trial. In report on previously treated patients, no responses were observed among 19
patients who received the 2-drug combination,67
whereas a second trial in chemotherapy-naive patients
resulted in 3 partial responders and 7 patients with
stable disease among 15 evaluable patients.68 Thus, it is
likely that the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel, by itself, has inherent activity in metastatic melanoma. The results of the Phase III trials will define the
real impact of adding sorafenib to this regimen in
patients with metastatic melanoma. A randomized
Phase II trial of 2 schedules of TMZ plus sorafenib also
is underway, and the preliminary results have been
considered encouraging.69

Anti-CTLA-4 Antibodies and Chemotherapy
Two human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies
have been tested in clinical trials: MDX-010 and CP-

461

675,206. Responses have been observed with both
antibodies administered as single-agent therapy in
patients with metastatic melanoma,70,71 providing a
rationale for combinations with chemotherapy. In a
Phase II study, the activity of MDX-010 alone or in
combination with DTIC was assessed. There were 2
partial responses in the antibody alone arm and 1
complete response and 4 partial responses in the
antibody plus DTIC arm, suggesting more activity for
the combination.72 In the long term follow-up of that
study, 1 additional complete response was observed
in the combination arm, and durable clinical
responses were noted.73 These results are intriguing,
but it remains unclear whether the activity of the
combination is simply additive or truly synergistic,
and further study probably is warranted in preclinical models.

Anti-BCL2 Antisense Oligonucleotide
Oblimersen sodium (anti-BCL2 antisense oligonucleotide) originally was tested in a Phase I/II trial in
combination with DTIC that was followed by a randomized Phase III trial in 771 patients. The primary
endpoint of that trial was overall survival, which was
not statistically significantly different between the 2
arms (9.1 months for the combination arm vs 7.9
months for DTIC alone arm), although overall and
complete response rates were significantly better for
the combination arm (overall response, 11.7% vs
6.8%, respectively; P ¼ .019) and progression-free survival was improved with the combination arm (74
days vs 49 days; P ¼ .0003). In an updated analysis,
for the subgroup of patients with LDH values 2
times the institutional upper limit of normal, there
was a statistically significant survival benefit for
combination therapy (10.2 months vs 8.7 months;
P ¼ .02).7 These data support the idea that oblimersen has at least modest activity when it is combined
with DTIC and justify further studies of this compound and similar strategies to overcome drug resistance in melanoma, as discussed by Eggermont.74
MEDI-522
MEDI-522 is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the aVb3 integrin. aVb3 is essential
for endothelial cell proliferation, maturation, and
survival; and, when it is blocked, proliferating endothelial cells undergo apoptosis and regress. In addition, aVb3 is highly expressed in melanomas and is
associated with tumor growth.76 In preclinical studies
using aVb3 antagonists, inhibition of melanoma tumor growth independent of its antiangiogenic effects
was reported.76 MEDI-522 has been investigated in 3
Phase I, dose-escalation studies in patients with re-

fractory cancer. In the Phase II trial, 57 patients
received MEDI-522 alone, and 55 patients received
MEDI-522 plus DTIC. MEDI-522 with or without
DTIC generally was well tolerated and was active in
patients with metastatic melanoma. The median survival was 12.6 months for the group that received
MEDI-522 with DTIC and 9.4 months for the group
that received MEDI-522 without DTIC.77 Those
results provided the impetus to evaluate single-agent
MEDI-522 in a confirmatory Phase III trial in patients
with melanoma.

CONCLUSIONS
A discouragingly long list of targeted agents already
have been tested in patients with melanoma and
have failed. This failure may attributed to the empiricism of trials that generally combined agents
because they were there (CVD, IL-2, and IFN) and a
general lack of studies that evaluated the posited
mechanisms of action for the agents used in combination, such as antisense to BCL2 or combinations
of antiestrogens with chemotherapy, to name a few—
in which the pursuit of tissue studies to validate the
hypothetical intervention likely would have been
helpful critically in reformulating the approaches
before huge trials were undertaken. We are entering
a new era for the systemic therapy of melanoma in
which the molecular events that drive tumor progression, on the one hand, and the suppression of the
host immune response to tumor, on the other,
increasingly are understood. With this understanding,
the pursuit of trials that target the events critical to
progression and the lesions with immunity, which
may be associated with progression, increasingly are
feasible. It is incumbent upon investigators to design
clinical trials that can inform us why we succeed
when we do and, perhaps equally important, why we
fail when we fail at the levels of the tumor and the
immune response. We have a pressing need for more
effective single agents, which, either alone or in combination with agents that may abrogate resistance
and agents that may impact collateral pathways in a
rational manner, will achieve more a significant
impact on this disease.
