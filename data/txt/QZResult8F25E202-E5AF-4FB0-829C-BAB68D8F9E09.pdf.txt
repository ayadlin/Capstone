ABSTRACT
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial mechanism in carcinoma
progression, describes the process whereby epithelial cells lose their apico-basal
polarity and junctional complexes and acquire a mesenchymal-like morphology.
Several markers are considered to be authentic indicators of an epithelial or
mesenchymal status; however, there is currently no comprehensive or systematic
method with which to determine their functional relevance. Previously, we identified
a 33-gene EMT signature comprising 25 epithelial and 6 mesenchymal genes that
best describe this concept of the EMT spectrum. Here, we designed small-scale siRNA
screens targeting these six mesenchymal signature genes (CD99L2, EMP3, ITGA5,
SYDE1, VIM, ZEB1) to explore their functional relevance and their roles during EMT
reversal by nintedanib (BIBF1120) in a mesenchymal-like SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell
line. We found that neither cell proliferation nor cytotoxicity was affected by silencing
any of these genes. SKOV3 cells expressing siRNA against mesenchymal genes (ZEB1,
EMP3, CD99L2, ITGA5, and SYDE1) showed enhanced colony compaction (reduced
inter-nuclear distance). Inductions of E-cadherin expression were only observed in
SYDE1- and ZEB1-silenced SKOV3 cells. In addition, only SYDE1-silenced SKOV3 cells
showed increased anoikis. Finally, we identified that SYDE1 and ZEB1 were downregulated in nintedanib-treated SKOV3 cells and SYDE1- and ZEB1-silenced SKOV3
cells showed enhanced nintedanib-induced up-regulation of E-cadherin. Nintedanibtreated SKOV3 cells also showed colony compaction and decreases in EMT scores both
in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that SYDE1 and ZEB1 are functionally relevant in
EMT reversal. This study thus provides a proof-of-concept for the use of in vitro siRNA
screening to explore the EMT-related functions of selected genes and their potential
relevance in the discovery of EMT reversing drugs.

INTRODUCTION

mesenchymal cells [1]. In terms of understanding
cancer progression, the EMT process explains how in
situ carcinoma cells transform the cellular state from
epithelial to mesenchymal, with the cells transitioning
through intermediate/metastable phases as they invade

the local environment to metastasize [2, 3]. Transitioned
carcinoma cells also acquire stem cell-like properties,
which are reflected in their capacity to replicate seemingly
uninhibited in the new location [2, 4, 5]. During carcinoma
progression, cancerous cells are exposed to numerous
EMT-inducing cues that lead to this acquisition of this
transitioned or ‘EMTed’ phenotype [6]. The gain and/or
loss of various molecules is regarded as being indicative of
an EMTed phenotype [1, 7], with many of these molecules
identified to be direct transcriptional targets of the EMT
inducers SNAI and ZEB transcription factor family
members [1]. With the exception of E-cadherin function—
one of the best studied mechanisms in EMT—most of
these EMT genes have not been extensively characterized
for their functional relevance in terms of drug discovery
or the regulatory pathways involved with their activity.
During the course of EMT, E-cadherin is involved in the
dynamic modulation of cell adhesion, which endows cells
with altered migratory and invasive properties [8, 9].
Numerous EMT markers have been described, with
almost 21 cancer-specific EMT signatures reported [10].
These EMT signatures show various degrees of correlation
among each other, and, together, paint a picture of the
continuous spectrum of EMT [10]. However, there has
been limited comprehensive and systematic analysis to
determine the functional relevance of each of the EMT
markers derived from these EMT signatures. Previously,
we defined EMT as a spectrum comprising four
phenotypic subgroups—Epithelial (E), Intermediate E,
Intermediate M, and Mesenchymal (M)—and uncovered a
33-gene EMT signature that best describes this phenotypic
spectrum [6]. This gene list includes genes that are
implicated in EMT as well as novel genes that have yet
to be reported as having functional relevance in EMT.
We have used this 33-gene EMT signature to classify an
ovarian carcinoma (OC) cohort into different EMT states
and correlated this classification with progression-free
survival [6]. Our previous studies therefore suggest that
these EMT genes can reflect certain functions related
to the aggressiveness of carcinoma cells. It is uncertain
though whether these EMT signature genes could serve as
a potential readout or bear functional relevance in terms of
reversing the EMT process.
EMT is reversible [3, 7], and this reversibility
has emerged as an increasingly attractive, alternative
therapeutic strategy for carcinoma [11] as compared
with conventional cytotoxic agents that are aimed at
eradication. Reversing EMT shares a similar concept
to that of differentiation therapy [12]. However, robust
models for the discovery of potential EMT reversal
agents and their associated mechanisms are limited.
An EMT model, established by silencing E-cadherin in
human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE_shEcad), has
been useful in screening for chemical compounds or
target pathways that would have preferential cytotoxicity
towards the cancer stem cell population in breast cancers
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[13, 14]. These studies, however, do not provide a
working model that directly searches for non-cytotoxic
EMT reversing agents. We have previously shown that
a model incorporating the NBT-2 rat bladder carcinoma
cell line offers a robust screening platform for the
identification of EMT reversing agents [15]. The readout
for this NBT-2 model is the inhibition of growth factorinduced cell scattering, which is an important phenotype
during EMT. However, these models still cannot provide
the mechanistic view to explain how EMT reversal was
achieved.
To this end, here we outline a proof-of-concept
for the use of six mesenchymal genes derived from the
33-gene EMT signature in their functional relevance to
EMT reversal. We designed small-scale siRNA screens to
explore the in vitro functions of these six mesenchymal
EMT genes using four assays—cytotoxicity, colony
compaction, induction of E-cadherin gene expression,
and anoikis resistance. Furthermore, we explored the
functional contribution of these six mesenchymal genes
in the presence of an EMT reversing agent, nintedanib
(BIBF1120). Our findings demonstrate the utility of this
six-mesenchymal gene signature in ascertaining relevant
functions during EMT reversal.

RESULTS
The six-gene mesenchymal signature is correlated
with disease outcomes
We validated the expression levels of the 33 genes
from the EMT signature [6] on a panel of OC cell lines,
SGOCL(43), and confirmed that six mesenchymal genes
showed good correlation with mesenchymal(Mes)-like
phenotypes (for details, refer to Supplementary Materials).
We first explored whether this six-mesenchymal gene
signature showed any clinical relevance using microarray
datasets across various cancer types; this analysis was
chosen to assign Epi-like or Mes-like subgroups and
correlate the subgroups with survival (Figure 1). For
progression/disease-free survival (PDFS), which includes
progression-free and recurrence-free survival rates, the
Mes-like subgroups showed significantly shorted PDFS
in the ovarian and colorectal cancer datasets (Figure 1A).
For overall survival (OS), the Mes-like subgroups showed
significantly poorer outcomes in the ovarian, gastric, and
pancreatic cancers (Figure 1B). This result was concordant
with our previous report on the correlation between EMT
status defined by a generic EMT signature and survival
outcomes [10]. Our analysis indicates the strong clinical
importance of the six-mesenchymal gene signature
and therefore warrants further understanding of their
functional relevance.

Mesenchymal signature genes have little effect on
proliferation

Colony compaction is increased by the inhibition
of mesenchymal signature genes

We were interested to know whether these six
mesenchymal signature genes would have functional
relevance in reversing EMT. Assays were designed using
a custom-made siRNA library for the six-mesenchymal
signature genes, assembled into 6-well, 96-well and 24well formats, to test the knockdown efficiency and the
effects of these genes on cell proliferation (cytotoxicity)
and morphology (colony compaction) (Figure 2A). The
optimization of this siRNA screen is described elsewhere
[16]. The knockdown efficiency of these six mesenchymal
genes ranged from 63% to 88% (Figure 2B). We first
examined the effects of these six mesenchymal genes
on cell proliferation using an MTS assay 72 hours posttransfection in the Intermediate Mesenchymal SKOV3
cell line. As shown in Figure 2C, the transient knockdown
of the mesenchymal genes in SKOV3 cells showed no
significant effect on cell proliferation as compared with
the negative control siRNA (Figure 2C, Table 1). Thus, our
data suggest that these mesenchymal signature genes had
minimal to no effect on cell proliferation or cytotoxicity.

Colony compaction is one of the hallmarks of
epithelial-like cells. We next investigated the effect
of knocking down the six mesenchymal signature
genes on colony compaction by examining the internuclear distances. As shown in Figure 2D, the transient
knockdown of five out of the six mesenchymal genes in
SKOV3 cells resulted in significantly decreased internuclear distances. Whereas the negative control cells
showed an average inter-nuclear distance of 43.9 µm, the
siZEB1-, siEMP3-, siCD99L2-, siITGA5-, and siSYDE1SKOV3 cells showed significantly reduced mean internuclear distances of 39.5, 36.6, 34.4, 34.0, and 38.7 µm,
respectively (p = 0.0002; 4.02E-09; 8.52E-17; 2.28E-18;
3.76E-05). Cells treated with siVIM had an average internuclear distance of 43.6 µm, demonstrating that transient
knockdown of VIM had no effect on colony compaction
in SKOV3 cells. The degree of colony compaction in
response to these siRNAs ranged from 10% to 22%
(Table 1). Overall, our data suggest that, by manipulating
the expression of certain mesenchymal genes, the EMT
phenotype can be partially altered.

SYDE1 and ZEB1 mesenchymal signature genes

(Figure 3B). Our data therefore indicate that SYDE1 and
ZEB1 act upstream E-cadherin and its expression.

Anoikis resistance is altered by the inhibition of
mesenchymal signature genes

Despite observing significant colony compaction
upon knocking down mesenchymal signature genes, we
did not observe any full reversal of EMT phenotypes
under the conditions tested (Supplementary Figure 2). This
prompted us to examine if this partial EMT reversal was
associated with the restoration of the prototypic epithelial
gene, E-cadherin/CDH1. Only siSYDE1- and siZEB1SKOV3 cells showed a significant up-regulation in
CDH1, up to 1.58- (p = 0.026) and 4.99-fold (p = 0.0008),
respectively (Figure 3A & Table 1). E-cadherin protein
expression was confirmed by western blotting, which
showed a similar trend, with increased E-cadherin protein
expression found in siSYDE1- and siZEB1-SKOV3 cells

The reversal of EMT has been shown to correlate
with altered anoikis resistance [6]. We thus also sought to
explore whether these six mesenchymal signature genes
would contribute to anoikis resistance. We compared
the percentage of the Annexin-V-positive populations
at 48 h and 96 h in ultra-low attachment cultures, with
this time difference use to assess any increments in cells
entering apoptosis. For the cell fractions entering the early
anoikis phase (Annexin-Vhigh/PIhigh population), we found
no significant difference in anoikis resistance, with the

exception of a slight increase for the siVIM cells at 48 h
as compared with the siOTP control (Figure 3C, upper).
For cells in the late anoikis phase (Annexin-Vhigh/PIlow
population), we measured a significant increase in the
siSYDE1 cells at both 48 h (2.35 % to 3.05 %) and 96 h
(11.85 % to 15.85 %) (Figure 3C, lower), as compared
to the siOTP control. The siZEB1 cells did not show
significant increase in Annexin-Vhigh populations. These
results suggest that, between the two genes that regulate
E-cadherin expression, SYDE1 further regulated anoikis
resistance ability.

in a gene expression profiling meta-analysis of 1,538
OC samples [16]. As shown in Figure 3D, these six
mesenchymal genes were all overexpressed in the
Mes molecular subtype of OC, a subtype designated as
having the worst OS. A binary comparison between the
Mes subtype versus the other subtypes using the MannWhitney Test showed the most extreme significance
of the overexpression of EMP3, ITGA5, SYDE1, and
ZEB1 in the Mes molecular subtype (Table 1). Since
these six mesenchymal genes had minimal roles on cell
proliferation, we concluded that the aggressiveness of the
Mes molecular subtype might not be due to preferential
growth advantage. Instead, this aggressiveness might be
attributed to the ability of the EMT phenotype to respond
to changes in the microenvironment, such as overcoming
anoikis.

in the Mes molecular subtype of OC
Since the six-mesenchymal gene signature predicted
worse PDFS and OS in OC (Figure 1), we validated the
expression patterns of these six mesenchymal genes

Triple angiokinase inhibitor, nintedanib, restores
E-cadherin expression during EMT reversal

kb CDH1 and CDH3 promoter constructs, and SKOV3
cells were then treated with DMSO or 5 µM nintedanib
for 24 h. Using the dual-luciferase assay, we found that
nintedanib induced a significant increase in the promoter
activities of E-cad, CDH1, and CDH3 (Figure 4B, 4C),
and that this increase linearly correlated with nintedanib
concentrations; indeed, a 50% induction of E-cad
promoter activity was determined at about 1 µM, with
induction plateauing at 5 µM (Figure 4D). Furthermore,
5 µM nintedanib concomitantly up-regulated both
E-cadherin protein and CDH1 transcript levels (Figure
4E, 4F). In a wash-out experiment after 5 µM nintedanib
for 24 h or prolonged treatments for up to 3 days without
replenishment, we noted that the mean fold-change in
CDH1 transcript levels dropped between 1.4–1.5-fold
(Figure 4F). Finally, consistent with the promoter activity
results, the induction of CDH1 gene expression followed
a dose-dependent trend (Figure 4G). Collectively, these
data indicate that E-cadherin gene induction follows a
dose-dependent, linear function of the active concentration
of nintedanib, and we can therefore conclude that EMT
reversal and E-cadherin restoration caused by nintedanib
were not due to random off-target effects.

EMT reversal can be achieved by tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), such as the Src-kinase inhibitor
saracatinib (AZD0530), which acts to up-regulate
E-cadherin expression both in vitro and in vivo [6]. Here,
we treated Intermediate Mesenchymal SKOV3 cells with
nintedanib (BIBF1120), another TKI that has phenotypic
EMT reversing effects (Figure 4A). We have previously
demonstrated that a short version of the E-cadherin
promoter region containing the E-box sequences can be
used to reflect an increase in CDH1 promoter activity upon
EMT reversal [6]. CDH1 maps to the human chromosome
16q22.1 and is in tandem with CDH3, the gene coding for
P-cadherin, which shares similar control at the upstream
promoter region [24]. To test if nintedanib would have
the same induction of CDH1 promoter activity, we
cloned the putative 1.2-kb promoter region around the
transcriptional start site (TSS) (Supplementary Table 1) for
CDH1 and CDH3 into a pGL3basic luciferase expression
vector. Transient transfection was performed with the

mediates
the
nintedanib-induced
E-cadherin restoration and EMT reversal

by mesenchymal signature genes other than ZEB1.
We utilized a custom-made siRNA library for the six
mesenchymal signature genes to test the differences in the
nintedanib effects on E-cadherin induction (Figure 5A).
Consistent with the siRNA-only results, siSYDE1 and
siZEB1 increased CDH1 expression by 1.5- and 4.3-fold,
respectively, in DMSO-treated SKOV3 cells (Figure 5B,
5C). As expected, nintedanib treatment caused significant
CDH1 induction in all siRNA-treated groups as compared
with the DMSO control. The nintedanib-treated siSYDE1
and siZEB1 SKOV3 cells showed the highest CDH1
induction at 12.1- and 31.4-fold, respectively (Figure 5B,
5C). These data indicate that nintedanib alone might act
through the down-regulation of the mesenchymal genes,
SYDE1 and ZEB1, to directly restore CDH1 expression.
Further silencing of SYDE1 and ZEB1 might sensitize the

We continued to explore the possible mechanism of
nintedanib-mediated E-cadherin induction by examining
changes in the expression of several known EMT players:
CDH1, ERBB3, SNAI1, and ZEB1. The induction of
epithelial genes CDH1 and ERBB3 followed a dosedependent trend following nintedanib treatment (Figure
4G). However, nintedanib only caused a significant
reduction in ZEB1 but not SNAI1 expression (Figure 4G);
this is different from saracatinib, which reduces SNAI1
but not ZEB1 expression [6]. Interestingly, nintedanib
also induced a 2-fold down-regulation in the mesenchymal
gene SYDE1 (data not shown). We next asked whether the
EMT reversing effect of nintedanib might be mediated

Combination of EMT reversing TKIs significantly
enhances E-cadherin restoration but causes cellcycle arrest

cells for nintedanib-induced EMT reversal.
Interestingly, nintedanib-treated siCD99L2, siEMP3,
siITGA5, and siVIM SKOV3 cells also showed slightly
higher CDH1 induction (8.87-, 7.82-, 8.02-, 7.36-fold,
respectively) compared with the siOTP control (6.66fold) (Figure 5C). This suggests that transient silencing of
these mesenchymal signature genes further sensitizes the
nintedanib-induced CDH1 induction in these Intermediate
Mesenchymal SKOV3 cells. The expression of SYDE1 and
ZEB1 remained unchanged (data not shown) under these
conditions; therefore, we speculate that the mechanisms
might be SYDE1- and ZEB1-independent for these
siRNAs. In terms of colony compaction, as measured
by inter-nuclear distance, nintedanib treatment did not
induce further changes following silencing of all six
mesenchymal genes as compared with the siOTP control
(Figure 5D), suggesting that nintedanib alone causes
colony compaction effects independent of the induction
of CDH1 expression.

We went on to test if the combination of EMT
reversing TKIs would have a synergistic effect on EMT
reversal and E-cadherin restoration. SKOV3 cells were
labeled with green fluorescence protein (GFP) and then
treated with saracatinib and nintedanib as single agents
or in combination (double TKI or dTKI). As shown in
Figure 6, the combination of 2.5 µM saracatinib and 2.5
µM nintedanib significantly increased CDH1 transcript
levels as compared with 5 µM of each agent alone (Figure
6A). However, E-cadherin protein levels did not show
further enhancement (Figure 6B). To confirm whether
the combination could further change the EMT status of
SKOV3-GFP cells, we used gene expression microarray
analysis, and derived quantitative EMT scores for these

cells as described previously [10]. The dTKI-treated
SKOV3-GFP cells demonstrated a trend toward a decrease
in EMT scores as compared with the control (Figure 6C).
Nintedanib-treated SKOV3-GFP cells showed a slightly
lower EMT score as compared with those treated with
saracatinib or both drugs in combination. The effect
of saracatinib-nintedanib combination on E-cadherin
promoter activity was further assessed based on ChouTalalay combination index (CI) [30]. The CI analysis
showed that saracatinib-nintedanib combination indeed
had a synergistic effect (Supplementary Figure 3B, 3C).
We also noticed that these dTKI-treated cells showed
slower propagation rates in vitro and, upon performing
cell cycle analysis, these dTKI-treated cells demonstrated
significantly decreased G2/M and increased G0/G1
populations (Figure 6D). The gene ontology (GO) analysis
from the expression microarray data of these dTKI-treated
cells also supported our findings (Supplementary Figure
3A). Therefore, we suspected that these dTKI-treated cells
might not have enhanced sensitivity towards conventional
chemotherapeutics, such as mitotic inhibitors. As shown
in Figure 6E, the GI50 of nintedanib-treated SKOV3GFP cells to paclitaxel, docetaxel and vincristine did not
differ much from the DMSO-treated cells. Therefore, we
concluded that these TKIs with EMT reversing effects,
as single agents or in combination, might not be ideal
to induce chemo-responsiveness or to reverse chemoresistance. However, we did observe that when treating
the SKOV3 cells in vivo xenografts with saracatinib and
nintedanib as single agents or in combination, the EMT
scores of the xenografts were decreased, suggesting a
reversal (Figure 6F). In addition, these dTKI-treated
xenografts demonstrated enhanced resectability during
tumor harvesting, suggesting further modifications to the
tumor microenvironments.

µM, respectively (Figure 7B). In A549 cells, both the
transcript and protein expressions of E-cadherin were
significantly increased following nintedanib treatment
(Figure 7C, 7D). The increase of CDH1 transcript in A549
cells was negatively correlated with the decrease of ZEB1
expression (Figure 7D). In concordance with SKOV3
cells, the expressions of another epithelial marker ERBB3
were also significantly induced in A549 and T24 cells and
had an increasing trend in Mia-Paca2 cells (Figure 7D).
Our data supported that nintedanib had a general EMT
reversal effect on cancer cell lines with an intermediate
EMT state in the in vitro system.

DISCUSSION
Various EMT markers have been touted as reliable
indicators of an epithelial or mesenchymal status; yet,
their functional relevance along the EMT spectrum has
not been clearly established. In this study, we provide a
proof-of-concept for the use of in vitro siRNA screening
to ascertain the role of these indicators in EMTrelated functions. Using six mesenchymal genes from
a previously established 33-gene EMT signature, we
identified that transient silencing of mesenchymal genes
ZEB1, EMP3, CD99L2, ITGA5, and SYDE1 reduced the
inter-nuclear distance in SKOV3 cells without affecting
cell proliferation, thereby causing a partial EMT reversal.
Furthermore, we show that reversing the EMT phenotype
in SKOV3 cells with nintedanib was accompanied by an
up-regulation of CDH1, at both the gene expression level
and at the promoter region, as well as a down-regulation
of the mesenchymal genes, SYDE1 and ZEB1. Downregulating these two mesenchymal genes, SYDE1 and
ZEB1, further enhanced the effect of nintedanib in CDH1
induction, suggesting that nintedanib might act via SYDE1
and ZEB1 to mediate E-cadherin restoration and EMT
reversal effects.
SKOV3 cells transiently silenced with siRNA
against CD99L2 and ITGA5 showed the greatest reduction
(~20%) in inter-nuclear distance and, consequently,
increase in colony compaction. CD99L2 is a much lessstudied gene as compared with ITGA5 yet they are both
known to mediate cell adhesion. CD99L2 encodes a cellsurface protein that is similar to CD99 and plays a role
in the later stages of leukocyte extravasation across the
endothelial basement membrane [17]. ITGA5 encodes the
integrin alpha 5 chain, which undergoes post-translational
cleavage in the extracellular domain to yield disulfidelinked light and heavy chains that join with beta 1 to
form the fibronectin receptor [18]. α5β1 integrin has
an unambiguous role in promoting angiogenesis and
carcinoma metastasis in ovarian and lung carcinoma,
glioblastoma, and melanoma [19]. Patients with high
α5β1 integrin expression are often associated with poorer
outcomes. From our dataset, the ITGA5 expression level
was also significantly higher in the Mes molecular subtype

Nintedanib-induced EMT reversal in selected
lung, bladder, and pancreatic cancer cells
To test if the nintedanib effect in EMT reversal
is exclusive for ovarian cancer, three additional cell
lines A549, T24, and Mia-Paca2 representing lung,
bladder, and pancreatic cancer were selected for testing.
These three cell lines were selected due to their similar
EMT scores to SKOV3 [10] suggesting that they are at
a similar intermediate EMT state. As shown in Figure
7A, all three cell lines demonstrated significant colony
compaction and reversal to a more epithelial phenotype.
The bladder adenocarcinoma cell line T24 and the
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line Mia-Paca2 showed
induction of E-cadherin promoter activity upon nintedanib
treatment (Figure 7B). The 50% required doses for
E-cadherin promoter induction concentration (EpIC-50)
identified for nintedanib to restore E-cadherin expression
in both T24 and Mia-Paca2 cells were 260 nM and 3.5

of OC, which is correlated with worse survival. Therefore,
it has become an attractive therapeutic target in solid
tumors, with various therapeutic approaches, including
humanized antibodies, non-peptide antagonists with RGDlike motifs, and non-RGD like peptides, which interfere
with integrin binding [19].
We identified SYDE1 and ZEB1 to be the
downstream mediators for nintedanib-induced CDH1
(E-cadherin) restoration. The transcriptional control
of CDH1 by ZEB1 has been extensively demonstrated
in various settings during EMT [2]. There has been no
previous association that SYDE1 might play a role in the
transcriptional control of CDH1. SYDE1, the gene coding
for Synapse Defective Protein 1 Homolog 1, is the human
ortholog for syd-1 in C. elegans and Drosophila. Syd1 is an important regulator in pre-synaptic active zone
assembly [20, 21]. SYDE1 was included in a prognosisassociated 3-gene signature in renal cell carcinoma [22].
Its functional roles in mammals are not clear. Transient
silencing of SYDE1 and ZEB1 significantly enhanced
the nintedanib-induced CDH1 transcript expression.
This suggests that down-regulation of SYDE1 and ZEB1
might “prime” the cells towards the epithelial side of
the spectrum to become more “Intermediate Epithelial”like, and this, in turn, sensitizes the cell’s response
to nintedanib in terms of EMT reversal. Intriguingly,
nintedanib has been shown to exert no effect on either
the EMT phenotype or E-cadherin expression in lung or
pancreatic cancer xenograft models [23]. In our hands,
SKOV3 xenografts have shown a significant induction
of E-cadherin expression and decreased EMT scores
following nintedanib treatment. The fact that nintedanib
initiated a dose-dependent induction of E-cadherin
promoter activity suggests that the effect is unlikely to
be a random, off-target effect. We further demonstrated
that this reversal can be applied to other in vitro cell
lines in lung, bladder, and pancreatic cancers. Therefore,
the transcriptional control of the E-cadherin gene at the
proximity of the promoter site provides the crucial key to
understanding reversibility.
In humans, CDH1 is located on the plus strand of
chromosome 16q22.1 and is arranged in tandem with
the P-cadherin gene, CDH3, which is situated 14-Kb
upstream of CDH1. We identified that CDH1 and CDH3
were both up-regulated following nintedanib treatment.
We previously reported that E-cadherin expression can
be restored in SKOV3 cells by Saracatinib (AZD0530)
[6]. CDH3 promoter activity was also significantly
enhanced in SKOV3 cells following saracatinib treatment
(unpublished data). The promoter regions of CDH1 and
CDH3 are highly conserved, harboring a GC-rich region
with an SP1 binding site, a CAAT box, and two AP2
binding motifs without a TATA box. It is worth noting that
the E-box sequences are only located in the CDH1, not
CDH3, promoter region [24]; thus, CDH1 transcription
can be negatively regulated by the binding of the SNAI
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and ZEB transcriptional repressor families to the E-boxes
[25]. Data elucidating the transcriptional control of
CDH3 at its promoter, however, has been limited. The
expression of CDH1 and CDH3 in the OC cell line panel,
SGOCL(43), were highly correlated with an Epithelial
phenotype, with the highest expression occurring at this
stage of the EMT spectrum (Supplementary Figure 1).
CDH1 and CDH3 showed a concordant up-regulation
following nintedanib treatment in SKOV3 cells, which
have a low basal expression of CDH1 and CDH3.
This suggests that there could be a synchronized effect
on the common regions within the 1.2-kb promoter
sequences. One possibility would be that the regulation
of CDH1 and CDH3 promoter activation by nintedanib
is independent of E-boxes because of its absence in the
CDH3 promoter region. Since we also observed a similar
increase in the promoter activity using the short version
of the E-cadherin promoter (-108 to +125), we speculate
that the responsive elements of nintedanib must be within
the overlapping 207-bp (-108 to +99) region of the
E-cadherin gene. Another possibility is that the regulation
of CDH1 promoter activation still depends on E-boxes
and the CDH3 promoter activation follows a separate
mechanism. This could be supported by the suppression
of ZEB1 following nintedanib treatment. Nevertheless, the
functional consequence of the concordant up-regulation
of CDH1 and CDH3 warrants further investigation. Many
studies have elucidated the potential roles of P-cadherin
in interfering with E-cadherin functions and in facilitating
metastasis [26-28]. Therefore, relying on one marker (such
as E-cadherin) alone to design a screening platform for
EMT reversing agents might not be optimal. Based on the
unique similarity of the promoter structure between CDH1
and CDH3, we propose prospectively a high-throughput
screening (HTS) model utilizing the CDH1 and CDH3
promoter activities as the major readouts to screen for
EMT reversing compounds that would only preferentially
induce CDH1 expression.
The increased induction of E-cadherin gene
expression following the co-treatment of nintedanib with
siRNAs against the six mesenchymal genes reveals that
transient silencing of these mesenchymal signature genes
further sensitized the nintedanib-induced CDH1 induction.
It is clear that SYDE1 and ZEB1 might be the crucial
regulatory nodes mediating the nintedanib effect in CDH1
induction. Further depletion of either SYDE1 or ZEB1
significantly enhances the nintedanib-induced CDH1 upregulation, suggesting that the restoration of E-cadherin
expression or reversal of EMT can be achieved more
efficiently by targeting the pivotal regulatory nodes. The
induction of SYDE1 or ZEB1 downstream of nintedanib
might explain why silencing the mesenchymal genes such
as CD99L2, EMP3, ITGA5, and VIM alone did not lead to
any significant up-regulation of E-cadherin. The effects of
E-cadherin induction seen in nintedanib in combination
with siRNAs against CD99L2, EMP3, ITGA5, VIM

resulted from the BIBF1120 effect on the down-regulation
of SYDE1 and ZEB1. Targeting ZEB1, a transcription
factor, has been demonstrated by delivering its specific
targeting micro-RNA mimics via nanoliposomes [29].
However, the strategy to target SYDE1 is still elusive, as
the understanding of its role(s) in human cancers is very
limited.
In conclusion, we explored two strategies to
ascertain the utility of EMT reversal in carcinoma: the
first, assessing EMT-related biological functions, such as
the induction of colony compaction; the second, inducing
re-differentiation of mesenchymal-like cells by the upregulation of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin. We
also reported, for the first time, that a triple angiokinase
inhibitor, nintedanib, exerts EMT reversal effects in
both colony compaction and restoration of E-cadherin
expression via the regulation of two mesenchymal genes,
SYDE1 and ZEB1. The non-redundant nature of these
two strategies provides an in vitro screening platform for
the study of EMT-related functions and the utilization of
selected EMT markers for drug discovery.

Nucleic acid isolation
RNA was isolated based on the protocols described
in the miRNeasy Kit (#217004, Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA). Briefly, cells were lysed in QIAzol reagent (800
µL/10 cm2 culture surface area), and the lysate vigorously
mixed with 160 µl of chloroform before separating
the aqueous phase via centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15
min, 4°C). RNA was precipitated with 1.5× volume of
absolute ethanol (of aqueous phase) and purified using
the spin columns (provided in the kit). Isolated RNA
was subsequently resuspended in nuclease-free water
(provided in the kit). RNA concentration was determined
using the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and RNA integrity
was analyzed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Protein extraction and western blotting

Survival correlation of six mesenchymal signature
genes in various cancer datasets

Protein was isolated on ice using cold RIPA
buffer (#R0278, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA)
supplemented with protease (#539134) and phosphatase
(#524625) inhibitor cocktails (Calbiochem, San Diego,
CA, USA). Protein concentration was quantitated using
the BCA Protein Assay Kit (#23225, Thermo Fischer
Scientific). SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was performed
using 7.5% acrylamide gels that were transferred onto
PVDF membranes (#IPFL00010; Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA). Immunoblotting was performed by blocking
the membranes with 5% skim milk (Nacalai Tesque)
diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), followed by
incubating with mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin
(#610182, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA;
1:2500) or mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (#A1978,
Sigma-Aldrich; 1:5000). Following washing steps, the
membranes were then incubated with IRDye 800CWconjugated (#926-32210) or IRDye 680-conjugated
(#926-32220; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA)
goat anti-mouse antibodies. Following final washing steps,
the western blots were scanned using an Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).

Microarray gene expression data with survival
information for breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovarian,
and pancreatic cancers were extracted from the previously
processed dataset [10]. Briefly, the data were first
downloaded from Gene Omnibus (GEO; http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or ArrayExpress (https://www.
ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/). Second, the data were RMAnormalized, and finally, combined and standardized using
ComBat. In each dataset, the expression values of the six
mesenchymal signature genes were converted into ranks
and, subsequently, the average of the ranks was computed.
The median of the average was used to define epitheliallike (< median) and mesenchymal-like (≥ median). A
Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to measure the
correlation with overall and progression/disease-free
survival (PDFS). PDFS includes progression-free, local
recurrence-free, and distant recurrence-free survival. A
log-rank test was used to assess significance of survival
curve differences.

genes were used to study the gene knockdown effect
on Intermediate Mesenchymal SKOV3 OC cell lines,
respectively. KDalertTM GAPDH Assay Kit (#AM1639,
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to
optimize the transfection conditions and efficiency in each
cell line according to the manufacturer’s protocol before
the actual experiment. An OTP-none targeting pool was
used as the negative control. siRNAs were transfected
into each cell line in triplicate via reverse transfection
concomitant with cell seeding in 96-well plates on Day
1. In brief, 50 nM of siRNA was pre-incubated with 0.3
µl of DharmaFECT 3 transfection reagent for 30 min,
and then seeded onto cultures of 4000 SKOV3 cells per
well, respectively. At 72-h post-transfection, the cell
proliferation rate was determined using an MTS assay
(#G5430, CellTiter 96® Aqueous NonRad Proliferation
Assay; Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA), according to
manufacturer’s protocol.

Cells were seeded in 6-well ultra-low attachment
plates and transfected with siRNAs against the six
mesenchymal genes and control siOTP genes. After 48 and
96 h of incubation, the cells were collected and trypsinized
into single cell suspensions. The cells were then washed
twice with PBS and counted using a hemocytometer.
Equal numbers of cells were taken from each siRNA and
siOTP genes and then transferred into a 15-ml Falcon
tube (BD Biosciences). The cells were resuspended in
100 µl of 1× Annexin binding buffer. Five µl of Pacific
Blue Annexin-V (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 µl of 100 µg/ml
Propidium Iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) working solution were
added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Data
were acquired using a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).

Cloning of promoter constructs of CDH1 and
CDH3

Colony compaction assays for transient
knockdown of 6 mesenchymal signature genes

The putative 1.2-kb promoter regions of CDH1 and
CDH3 around the transcriptional start site (TSS)—ranging
from -1.0-kb to +0.2-kb of the TSS (Supplementary
Table S1)—were first cloned from the genomic DNA
of OVCA420 and HEY cells using PCR. The correct
fragments were confirmed and purified using agarose gel
electrophoresis. The gel-purified fragments were then
digested using restriction enzymes (RE) and columnpurified before cloning into a pGL3basic luciferaseexpressing vector (#E1751, Promega) in E. coli competent
cells (#C4040-03 One Shot® TOP10 Chemically
Competent E. coli, Life Technologies). Positive clones
were selected and further confirmed by sequencing. The
cloning sequences, cloning primers, and RE sites are
summarized in Supplementary Table S1.

KDalertTM GAPDH Assay Kit (#AM1639, Life
Technologies) was first used to optimize the transfection
conditions and efficiency in SKOV3 in a 24-well format,
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse
transfection was performed as described above with some
modifications: 50 nM of siRNA with 0.4 µl DharmaFECT
3 transfection reagent was used on 5000 SKOV3 cells
per well. Cells were seeded onto 33-mm diameter
coverslips and incubated for 72 h before fixation with
4% paraformaldehyde (#15714S Paraformaldehyde 32%
solution, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA,
USA). Immunofluorescence staining was performed for
E-cadherin (#610182, BD Biosciences; 1:100) and DAPI
(#H-1200 Vectashield Mounting Medium for fluorescence
with DAPI, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA,
USA).

In vitro EMT reversal assays

Analysis of inter-nuclear distance

Cells of interest were grown in complete media in
either 6-well plates (#140675, Nunc, Denmark) or 100mm dishes (#150350, Nunc) to allow growth until 60%
confluence prior to drug treatment. DMSO (#D8418,
Sigma-Aldrich; 0.05%), as a control, or nintedanib
(BIBF1120) at various concentrations were added for 24
h or 3 days (without replenishment) and the cells were
then subjected to downstream assays. Cells were examined
under a light microscope with phase contrast rings
(Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) to document
morphological changes. RNA and protein were harvested
and subjected to QPCR analysis and western blotting,
respectively, as described above. For promoter assays,
cells were seeded into 96-well plates (#3904, Corning Inc.,
Corning, NY, USA) at a density of 0.5–1.0×104 cells per

SKOV3 cells grown, fixed, and stained with
DAPI on coverslips were used for the inter-nuclear
distance analysis. To measure the inter-nuclear distance,
random images of the cell colonies were captured at 40×
magnification using an upright microscope (Zeiss Axio
Imager M2; Zeiss Microimaging; Thornwood, NY, USA).
The inter-nuclear distance was measured from the center
of one nucleus to that of a neighboring/adjacent nucleus.
The distance between the two nuclei was measured by
selecting ‘Distance Measure’ option in the ZEN software
(Zeiss Microimaging). A minimum of 200 inter-nuclear
distances were taken to obtain the mean inter-nuclear
distance for each condition.

of EMT signature genes or vector control plasmid using
XtremeGENE HP (#6366236001, Roche Applied Science;
Indianapolis, IN, USA) with a 2:1 HP:DNA ratio. The

manufacturer’s protocol.

plates at an optimal density pre-determined to ensure that
80% confluence was attained by the end of the assay.
Following an overnight incubation, the cells were treated
with either DMSO (vehicle control) or 5 µM BIBF1120
for 24 h, then nine concentrations of each drug (two-fold
dilution series over a 128-fold concentration range) and
co-treated with either DMSO or 5 µM BIBF1120 for 48 h
on the following day. The percentage of the cell population
responding to the drug relative to the negative controls was
measured using a CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay, following the manufacturer’s
recommendations (#G5430, Promega). Dose-response
curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism® version
5.04 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA), to
derive a growth inhibitory concentration of 50% (GI50;
drug concentration for 50% growth inhibitory effects on
cells) for each drug treatment in at least three independent
experiments. A Mann-Whitney U-test of GraphPad Prism
was used to statistically evaluate the averaged GI50s
between SKOV3-GFP DMSO-treated and SKOV3-GFP
BIBF1120-treated cells.

Gene expression microarray analysis for EMT
scores and gene ontology (GO)
Microarray gene expression data of SKOV3 cells
(GFP- and drug-treated) were RMA-normalized. A log2 fold-change relative to SKOV3-GFP was subsequently
computed for each gene and for each drug treatment.
Differentially expressed genes with log-2 fold-change
relative to SKOV3-GFP that were consistently greater than
+1.5 or lesser than -1.5 among replicates were deemed
significant. Gene ontology analysis was conducted using
the significant differentially expressed genes and DAVID
v6.7 (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp). Falsediscovery rate less than 25% was deemed significant.

SKOV3 xenograft experiments for EMT reversal
All animal work adhered to the Agency for Science,
Technology and Research (A*STAR; Singapore),
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
guidelines on the use and handling of animals. SKOV3Luc-D3 cells (Xenogen Co., Alameda, CA, USA) at a
density of 3.5×106 in 100 µl of PBS were injected into
the intraperitoneal cavity of 4-week-old female BALB/c
nude mice. At 6 weeks post-implantation, the mice were
randomly divided into control and treatment groups (n =
5 animals per group). For the treatment group, mice were
administered via oral gavage with 50 mg/kg AZD0530, 50
mg/kg BIBF1120, or 25 mg/kg AZD0530 plus 25 mg/kg
BIBF1120 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) for 5 days
a week for 2 weeks. The drug was re-suspended in 0.5%
hydroxypropyl methycellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1%
polysorbate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). The control group
received the vehicle buffer alone. The growth of tumor
xenografts was monitored by bioluminescence using the
IVIS system 2000 series (Xenogen Co.). The xenografts
were harvested at 8 weeks post-implantation for gene
expression microarray analysis (Affymetrix GeneChip
Human Gene 1.0ST Array, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to
ascertain the EMT scores, and then subjected to paraffin
embedding followed by immunohistochemical staining for
E-cadherin (#3195S, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA).

Cell cycle analysis
SKOV3-GFP cells were synchronised by serum
starvation in 10-cm dishes. After synchronization, the
serum-free medium was removed and the cells were
washed with 1×PBS and replenished with fresh medium
containing DMEM with 10% FBS together with the TKIs
or vehicle control. After 48 h, the cells were harvested,
washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with ice-cold 70%
ethanol overnight at 4°C. The cells were then centrifuged
at 600 ×g for 10 min at 4°C, and the ethanol discarded.
The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells
were then counted, and equal numbers of cells from each
condition were transferred into 5-ml round tubes. The
cells were treated with 10 µg/ml RNase A (Roche Applied
Science) for 10 min at room temperature and then stained
with 200 ng/ml of Propidium Iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) in
the dark for 15 min. Cell cycle analysis was performed
using BD LSR II (BD Biosciences) and analysed using the
FlowJo flow cytometry analysis software (Tree Star, Inc.,
Ashland, OR, USA).

GI50 assay of mitotic inhibitors
SKOV3-GFP cells were tested for their sensitivity
to paclitaxel, docetaxel and vincristine with BIBF1120.
Paclitaxel (#T7402) and vincristine (#V8879) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and docetaxel was
provided by Dr Wang Ling Zhi at Cancer Science
Institute of Singapore. The cells were seeded in 96-well
