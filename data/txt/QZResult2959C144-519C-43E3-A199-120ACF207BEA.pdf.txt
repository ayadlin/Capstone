ABSTRACT
Objective: A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the short-term
efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.
Methods: Randomized controlled trials of different chemotherapy regimens for
advanced gastric cancer were included in this study. Network meta-analysis combined
direct evidence and indirect evidence to evaluate the odds ratio and draw surface
under the cumulative ranking curves of different chemotherapy regimens in advanced
gastric cancer.
Results: The results of surface under the cumulative ranking curves showed
that S-1 and capecitabine regimens were better than fluorouracil. As for multidrug combination regimens, the disease control rate of cisplatin + capecitabine,
docetaxel + cisplatin + fluorouracil and etoposide + cisplatin + capecitabine regimens
were relatively better, while fluorouracil + adriamycin + mitomycin regimen was
relatively poorer when compared with cisplatin + fluorouracil regimen. Additionally,
the overall response ratio of cisplatin + capecitabine, paclitaxel + fluorouracil,
docetaxel + cisplatin + fluorouracil and etoposide + cisplatin + fluorouracil regimens
were relatively better, while the disease control rate of fluorouracil + adriamycin +
mitomycin regimen was relatively poorer when compared with cisplatin + fluorouracil
regimen. Furthermore, the results of cluster analysis demonstrated that cisplatin
+ capecitabine, etoposide + cisplatin + capecitabine, S-1 + paclitaxel and S-1 +
irinotecan chemotherapy regimens had better disease control rate and overall
response ratio for advanced gastric cancer patients.
Conclusion: This network meta-analysis clearly showed that multi-drug
combination chemotherapy regimens based on capecitabine and S-1 might be the
best chemotherapy regimen for advanced gastric cancer.

approximately one million new cases annually worldwide
and 850,000 deaths from GC, or about 12% deaths of
all cancer [3]. GC is a multifactorial disease caused by
environmental and lifestyle factors, other recognized risk
factors include smoking, obesity, dietary factors, radiation,
Helicobacter pylori infection, pernicious anemia and
partial gastrectomy, etc. [4]. Early detection is possible
with screening, but most GC patients are diagnosed at

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer (GC) is the 4th most common
malignant disease and the 2nd most frequent cause of
cancer-related deaths around the world [1]. GC is accepted
as a pathophysiologically heterogeneous disease, which
is associated with hematogenous metastasis, predominant
lymphatic spread, or intra-abdominal spread [2]. There are

an inoperable advanced stage which requiring palliative
chemotherapy [5]. The most widely used drugs as single
agents for chemotherapy are fluorouracil, doxorubicin,
cisplatin, mitomycin C, epirubicin, and etoposide, and
newer chemotherapeutic agents include the taxanes,
oxaliplatin oral fluoropyrimidines, and irinotecan [6].
Despite the advances achieved over the recent decades, the
prognosis of patients with advanced GC (AGC) remains
poor [7]. New chemotherapy regimens are desperately
needed for the benefit of improving the dismal prognosis
of AGC.
Currently, there is no globally accepted
chemotherapy regimen for AGC, some are used as single
agents, while others are used as part of combination
regimens. Fluorouracil is one of the most widely used
agents in the treatment of AGC, and it is a part of all
the primary multidrug regimens that have been reported
[8]. Fluorouracil monotherapy, as a standard treatment
for AGC, is associated with manageable toxicity, a
response rate of approximately 20%, and OS times of
between 5~7 months in phase III randomized studies
[9]. Recently, capecitabine and S-1, belonging to oral
fluoropyrimidines, are suggested to be more tolerable
than fluorouracil; and both of them showed exhibit
antitumor activity against AGC [10–12]. Capecitabine
(Xeloda, F. Hoffmann–La Roche) is known as an oral
fluoropyrimidine, which is designed to mimic a continuous
infusion of fluorouracil, and it has shown good response
rates in AGC patients when given as monotherapy or
in combination with other agents in phase II studies
[6]. Study has shown that replacing fluorouracil with
capecitabine plus cisplatin avoids the need for continuous
infusions and the combinations of two agents have
few overlapping toxic effects [13]. S-1 is a novel oral
fluoropyrimidine consisting of a tegafur (5-FU prodrug),
5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine (the dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase inhibitor) and potassium oxonate
(suppresses the gastrointestinal toxicity of tegafur) [14].
In 2007, one phase III trials in Japan (the JCOG9912 trial)
demonstrated that S-1 was not inferior to fluorouracil [15].
The other was the SPIRITS trial, which suggested that the
combination therapy of S-1-plus-cisplatin was superior
to S-1 monotherapy [12]. Since there are controversies
in different studies,, no consensus has been reached on
the optimal chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of
AGG in terms of single drug chemotherapy regimen and
multi-drug combination chemotherapy regimens based on
fluorouracil, capecitabine and S-1.
Network meta-analysis is a relatively new statistical
technique that gives access to compare both direct and
indirect evidence, even when two of the interventions
have not been directly compared [16]. Network metaanalysis can summarize randomized clinical trials (RTCs)
of several different treatment strategies, and supply point
estimates for their association with a given endpoint,
together with an estimate of incoherence. Therefore, we

performed a network meta-analysis to compare the shortterm efficacies of different chemotherapy regimens in the
treatment of AGC.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of included study
Through electronic databases, 3791 relevant
studies were initially identified. We excluded 684 studies
for duplicates, 101 for non-human studies, 2420 for no
relation to research topic. The remaining 586 articles were
further excluded according to the following factors: 124
studies related to targeted therapy, 287 studies related to
surgical treatment and 110 studies related to radiotherapy.
Eventually, 35 RCTs, published between 1991 and 2014,
were eligible for this network meta-analysis [11, 17–50].
These 35 RCTs altogether included 4555 GC patients
treated with twenty-four chemotherapy regimens including
cisplatin + fluorouracil (CF), docetaxel + cisplatin (DC),
irinotecan + cisplatin (CI), cisplatin + capecitabine
(CX), S-1 + cisplatin (S-1C), docetaxel + fluorouracil
(DF), paclitaxel + fluorouracil (PF), fluorouracil +
leucovorin (FL), docetaxel + oxaliplatin (DO), S-1 +
irinotecan (S-1I), S-1 + paclitaxel (S-1P), etoposide +
adriamycin + cisplatin (EAC), docetaxel + cisplatin +
fluorouracil (DCF), etoposide + cisplatin + fluorouracil
(ECF), fluorouracil + adriamycin + mitomycin (FAM),
fluorouracil + adriamycin + methotrexate (FAMTX),
etoposide + leucovorin + fluorouracil (ELF), fluorouracil
+ leucovorin + irinotecan (FLI), etoposide + cisplatin
+ capecitabine (ECX), fluorouracil + leucovorin +
cisplatin (FLC), and cisplatin + etoposide + leucovorin +
fluorouracil (CELF), and the majority of patients received
CF and FAMTX chemotherapy regimens (Figure 1a1b). Of these 35 enrolled studies, 15 studies were from
Caucasians, and 20 studies were from Asians; additionally,
29 studies were two-arm trials and 6 studies were threearm trials. The baseline characteristics of included studies
are displayed in Table 1.

Pairwise meta-analysis for short-term efficacy
of twenty-four chemotherapy regimens in the
treatment of advanced gastric cancer
We carried out direct pairwise comparisons for
the short-term efficacies of twenty-four chemotherapy
regimens in the treatment of AGC, and the results
suggested that the efficacies of fluorouracil, FAM and
FAMTX chemotherapy regimens were relatively poorer
in DCR of AGC patients when compared with CF regimen
(fluorouracil: OR = 0.37, 95%CI = 0.17~0.57; FAM: OR =
0.40, 95%CI = 0.02~0.78; FAMTX: OR = 0.50, 95%CI =
0.17~0.83) (Figure 2a). The efficacies of fluorouracil and
FAMTX chemotherapy regimens were relatively poorer in
ORR of AGC patients (fluorouracil: OR = 0.28, 95%CI =

capecitabine in terms of single drug regimen, while the
results of SUCRA showed that the chemotherapy regimens
of S-1 and capecitabine were better than fluorouracil.
Various chemotherapeutic agents have been used for
improving response rate (RR), progression-free survival
(PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life in patients
with AGC [51]. Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is
commonly used for AGC, which has been suggested
to have a survival benefit in comparison with the best
supportive care [31]. Study has shown that without the
inconvenience and complications associated with central
venous catheters for fluorouracil, capecitabine maintains
a constant level of 5-FU, which is therefore expected to
have improved efficacy and tolerability when compared
with protracted infusion 5-FU [52]. In the 1990s, S-1, as
an oral derivative of 5-FU, was produced for the treatment
of GC. As a single agent, S-1 was expected to have a high
response rate of 46%, which rapidly established itself as
a standard treatment for GC in Japan and was also used
widely in clinical practice [32]. The presence of these new
generation agents could play important roles in improving
patient outcomes, and presenting the access to establish
novel chemotherapeutic strategies and personalized

medicine, which would help for each individual to select
the optimal therapy and dose based on both the tumor and
the patient [53]. In consideration of the ORR, OS as well
as safety results, J-L Lee in his study provided evidence
that patients with AGC could benefit from capecitabine
or S-1 monotherapy with minimal adverse events [54]. A
subset analysis of the FLAGS trial demonstrated that S-1
seemed to have better efficacy than 5-FU in diffuse type
GC [55]. Both capecitabine and S-1 are more tolerable
than 5-FU, and has been shown to present antitumor
activity against AGC [56]. To some extent, single agent
chemotherapy could be regarded as a good and safe firstline treatment for AGC, and it can avoid the compounding
effects of other agents when combination therapy is used.
The network meta-analysis clearly shows that
multi-drug combination chemotherapy regimens based
on capecitabine and S-1 might be the best chemotherapy
regimen for AGC. Various attempts have been made
since the 1970s, in order to improve the results of
chemotherapy through using multi-drug combination
chemotherapy regimens. Randomized trials that making
comparisons between monotherapy with combination
regimens have consistently indicated increased response

rates and survival rates in favor of combination regimens
[57]. A randomized phase III trial have compared the
combinations of fluorouracil with other agents in AGC:
infusional 5-FU plus cisplatin (FUP) vs etoposide, LV
and 5-FU (ELF) vs 5-FU, doxorubicin and methotrexate
(FAMTX) [46]. However, a chemotherapy combination
containing infusional 5-FU has the disadvantage of
implanting a central venous catheter, and this procedure
increases the incidence of subsequent complications,
the costs of treatment administration, and the level of
discomfort for the patient. The oral fluoropyrimidines
(capecitabine and S-1) have shown particular promise,
which therefore have the potential to reduce the times
of medical examinations related to intravenous injection
(i.v.) administration, to reduce the necessary resources
for the implantation of the i.v. device, as well as to

eliminate catheter-related adverse events [58]. Koizumi W
proposed that combined with other promising drugs (eg.
cisplatin, irinotecan and taxanes), oral fluoropyrimidinebased combination therapy was suggested to yield good
results, and especially, the combination of cisplatin and
oral fluoropyrimidines showed high efficacy, which was
expected to be a standard therapy for AGC [12]. When
S-1 was combined with other cytotoxic drugs, such as
irinotecan and cisplatin, it was found to be promising,
with relatively favorable safety profiles and response rates
of 50 % [59]. A randomized phase III study concerning
cisplatin and capecitabine (CX) combination therapy in
AGC patients showed that CX produced an ORR of 46%
and a median PFS of 5.6 months, which were remarkably
better than the poor results with FU/cisplatin (CF) regimen
[60]. All these verified that multi-drug combination

chemotherapy regimens based on capecitabine and S-1
showed better efficacy than that based on fluorouracil.
Our network meta-analysis offers several important
insights: (1) this study is the first network meta-analysis
comparing twenty-four chemotherapy regimens in
the treatment of AGC, and it bears important clinical
implications; (2) we formulated comprehensive search
strategy for minimizing possibilities of publication
bias; (3) the article referred to both direct and indirect
comparisons; (3) the posterior probabilities of SUCRA
were utilized to distinguish the slight differences in
chemotherapy regimens. However, several limitations of
this meta-analysis deserve comment: (1) the presence of
missing data in some of the enrolled studies might bias the
results; (2) there showed a slight difference in the baseline
characteristics of included patients in this network metaanalysis because of different eligible criteria in these
studies; (3) since the S-1 agents in enrolled studies were
derived from Asian countries, the S-1 regimens are widely
used for AGC in Japan [43]. Furthermore, the interethnic
differences of capecitabine were observed in genetic
changes, which resulting in different efficacy [34]. There
might be a certain racial difference, and subgroup analysis
could not be carried out for this reason. These limitations
might lead to a slight reduction in the validity of our
overall results.
The network meta-analysis clearly shows that
multi-drug combination chemotherapy regimens based
on capecitabine and S-1 might be the best chemotherapy
regimen for AGC. However, due to the limitations in our
study, our conclusion is needed to be confirmed by a more
adequately designed study for future clinical applications.

only treated with chemotherapy while without any
surgical treatments; (4) end outcomes included disease
control rate (DCR) and overall response rate (ORR). The
exclusion criteria included: (1) studies with insufficient
data; (2) non-RCTs, duplicated publications and AGC
patients received surgical treatment or radiotherapy. Two
reviewers extracted data from the enrolled studies using a
specifically designed form. Additionally, a third reviewer
was consulted if agreement could not be reached between
these two reviewers.

Statistical analysis
First, we conducted pair-wise meta-analyses of
direct evidence by using the random-effects model, which
was supplemented with R version 3.2.1 and the Meta
package. Second, random-effects network meta-analysis
was performed with the gemtc package. Lu and Ades
reported that by linking to Open BUGS, network metaanalysis models the relative effects fitting a generalized
linear model (GLM) under the Bayesian framework
[61]. The relative effects were converted to a probability,
which could judge whether a treatment was best or worst,
with the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA)
curve of each treatment [62] presented as a percentage,
ranging from 0%~100% (0%: worst; 100%: best). Based
on SUCRA curve, the summary estimates were showed in
league tables through ranking the treatments according to
priority of the most significant influence on the outcome
under consideration [62]. Our command of cluster rank
was used in the production of clustered ranking plots
in STATA. Outcome1 and outcome2 were regarded as
the data variables which containing the SUCRA values
for all the treatments in a network. The different colors
referred to the estimated clusters, which were used to
group the treatments in accordance with their similarity
in terms of both outcomes. The concept of design-bytreatment interaction supplied a useful general framework
to explore the inconsistency. Particularly, the application
of design-by-treatment interactions successfully dealt
with complications arising from the multi-arm trials in
an evidence network [63]. Lu and Ades also described
that a model motivated mainly by loop inconsistency.
We provided all models by using mvmeta, which was a

using the restricted maximum likelihood [64].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature search
PubMed, Embase, Ovid, EBSCO and Cochrane
Library were searched from the inception of each
database to July 2015. The search was conducted using
the combination of keywords and free words strategy,
the terms included “chemotherapy”, “pharmacotherapy”,
“cisplatin”, “fluorouracil”, “Capecitabine”, “Docetaxel”,
“Paclitaxel”, “Oxaliplatin”, “S-1” and “gastric cancer”,
etc. A manual search was also performed for the reference
lists of published articles, and literature searches were
supplemented by perusing the reference lists of previous
meta-analyses.
