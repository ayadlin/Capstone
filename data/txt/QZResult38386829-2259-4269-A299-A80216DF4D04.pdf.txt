Abstract

Author Manuscript

The signaling mediated by c-MET and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been
implicated in malignant progression of cancer involving stimulation of proliferation, invasion, and
metastasis. We studied the c-MET/HGF axis as a mediator of tumor-stromal interaction in ovarian
cancer and the value of targeting c-MET for the treatment of ovarian cancer. To assess c-MET
signaling, we established in vitro models of the microenvironment using primary and
immortalized human fibroblasts from normal ovary and tumor samples and epithelial ovarian
cancer cell lines. We found that fibroblast from normal ovaries secreted high levels of HGF (1,500
to 3,800 pg/mL) as compared to tumor-derived fibroblasts (undetectable level) and could elicit
cellular biological responses on c-MET expressing ovarian cancer cells including increase of cell
proliferation and migration (2- to 140-fold increase). HGF secreted by fibroblasts was also found
sequestered within extracellular matrices (ECMs) and when degraded this ECM-derived HGF
stimulated cancer cell migration (1.5- to 24-fold). In cells containing constitutive c-MET
phosphorylation, recombinant HGF and fibroblast-derived HGF negligibly affect c-MET
phosphorylation on Tyr1234 and Tyr1003. However, both sources of HGF increased the
phosphorylation of c-MET on Tyr1349, the multi-substrate docking site, by more than 6-fold and
led to activation of downstream signaling transducers. DCC-2701 (Deciphera Pharmaceuticals,

LLC), a novel c-MET/TIE-2/VEGFR inhibitor was able to effectively reduce tumor burden in vivo
and block c-MET pTyr1349-mediated signaling, cell growth, and migration as compared to a HGF
antagonist in vitro. Importantly, DCC-2701’s anti-proliferative activity was dependent on c-MET
activation induced by stromal human fibroblasts and to a lesser extent exogenous HGF. Our data
suggest for the first time that DCC-2701 may be superior to HGF antagonists that are in clinical
trials and that pTyr1349 levels might be a good indicator of c-MET activation and likely response
to targeted therapy as a result of signals from the microenvironment.

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic malignancies
diagnosed in the U.S. (1). Rapid progression of ovarian cancer without symptoms makes this
disease deadly and difficult to clinically manage (2).

Author Manuscript

Stromal cells play a significant role in malignant progression of cancer (3, 4). In particular,
fibroblasts and their derived extracellular matrices (ECMs) compose a large part of stroma
and are associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer development (5). Fibroblasts
secrete many paracrine signalling factors that promote proliferation, invasion, and migration
of cancer cells (3, 4). Those growth factors secreted by fibroblasts are incorporated into the
ECM and can transduce signals to cancer cells without being released (solid-phase ligands)
or following degradation of the ECM and their release (6). Therefore, stromal components in
the ovary might be important contributors of rapid progression of ovarian cancer and
interruption of their interaction with cancer cells may be an important therapeutic target.

Author Manuscript

Among many stromal growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is expressed mainly
in mesenchymal cells and acts on epithelial cells (7, 8). This epithelial-stromal relationship
of c-MET and HGF was reported in normal ovary as well (9). HGF is also one of the known
growth factors that can bind to extracellular matrix proteins or proteoglycans (10, 11),
thereby being sequestered within ECMs to elicit biological responses when it is necessary.
More importantly, HGF is a unique cytokine that induces pleiotropic biological responses,
involving proliferation, invasion, and dissemination of cancer cells (7, 12). Recent reports
reiterate a significant role of fibroblast-derived HGF in mediating disease progression as
well as immediate innate resistance to targeted therapies (13, 14). In addition,
overexpression of c-MET, the only known receptor for HGF, has been reported in many
cancers of epithelial cell origin including ovarian cancer (12, 15).
The versatile biological effect of c-MET/HGF signalling made it an attractive therapeutic
target and many small molecules of c-MET kinase inhibitors and antibodies targeting HGF
or c-MET have been developed. Encouragingly, targeting c-MET using PF-2341066 (16) or
foretinib, a multikinase inhibitor (17), exhibited effective anti-tumor activities against
ovarian cancer in animal models. However, no anti-tumor effect was observed in an ovarian
cancer clinical trial conducted using AMG-102, humanized IgG2 directed against HGF,

capable of preventing HGF binding to c-MET and subsequent c-MET activation (12, 18,
19). This disappointing clinical outcome might be due to the ineffective penetration of
antibody-based drug into tumors, the inability to completely sequester ligand, and/or that cMET activation may be independent of HGF in ovarian cancer.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we evaluated c-MET and HGF signalling as a mediator of stromal-cancer cell
interaction in ovarian cancer using human ovarian fibroblast and their derived ECMs. We
evaluated a novel c-MET/TIE-2/VEGFR inhibitor, DCC-2701, and assessed its ability to
inhibit the HGF/c-MET axis stimulated by stromal-cancer cell interactions. We report that
human ovarian fibroblasts secrete HGF that lead to increased growth and migration of
ovarian cancer cells. HGF that was sequestered within fibroblast-produced ECMs was also
functional upon degradation of the ECM by tumor cells. Fibroblast-derived HGF increased
the c-MET phosphorylation on Tyr1349 and cells with maximum activation of c-MET were
more susceptible to drug inhibition.

RESULTS
Ovarian cancer cells exhibit enhanced migration by interaction with ovarian fibroblasts
and their derived ECMs

Author Manuscript

A transwell co-culture system was used to evaluate the effect of factors secreted by
fibroblasts or released from fibroblast-derived ECMs on ovarian cancer cell migration.
Ovarian cancer cells were allowed to migrate in the presence of different fibroblasts and
their derived ECMs. Ovarian cancer cells were not highly migratory without the signals
produced by ovarian fibroblasts with the exception of SKOV3 cells (Figure 1a), e.g.,
immortalized human fibroblasts from normal ovaries (IHFNO-303 fibroblasts) enhanced
migration by more than 30-, 4-, 20-, 140-, and 1.9-fold in OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR5,
PEO1, and SKOV3, respectively. In comparison, OVCAR10 cells did not respond to
fibroblast signals (Figure 1a). OVCAR3, OVCAR4 and SKOV3 cells exclusively showed
increased migration in the presence of IHFNO-303 while other fibroblasts, IHFNO-402 and
IHFOT-208, could also promote the migration of OVCAR5 and PEO1 cells (Figure 1a).
Cells exhibiting significantly enhanced migration in response to IHFNO-303 fibroblasts also
exhibited significantly increased (p < 0.05) migration in the presence of IHFNO-303 derived
matrix (Figure 1a & b). Increase of cell migration was modest or minimal by the interaction
with ECMs derived from IHFNO-402 and IHFOT-208 (IHFNO-402M and IHFOT-208M,
respectively).
HGF is a major stromal growth factor that contributes to the enhanced cell migration by
fibroblasts

Author Manuscript

In order to determine the factor(s) that promotes migration of ovarian cancer cells, we
evaluated a larger panel of growth factors and cytokines (data not shown). Only one of the
growth factors, HGF, corresponded to the migration patterns seen in Figure 1. Therefore,
HGF levels were further established by ELISA from fibroblast- and ECM-conditioned
media in the presence and absence of ovarian cancer cells. As shown in Figure 2a, HGF
concentration was significantly higher in conditioned media derived from IHFNO-303 and
IHFNO-303M (average of 3,800 pg/mL and 800 pg/mL, respectively) compared to serum

free or standard media. None of the cancer cells produced detectable level of HGF with the
exception of OVCAR10 cells that secreted 620 pg/mL of HGF (Figure 2a). We also
obtained conditioned media from primary fibroblasts derived from normal ovaries and
ovarian tumors and measured HGF levels. In human fibroblasts derived from normal ovaries
(HFNO-), 4 out of 6 fibroblasts secreted high level of HGF (1,500 to 2,200 pg/mL), but
none of the fibroblasts derived from ovarian tumors (HFOT-) secreted measurable HGF
levels (Figure 2b). The levels of HGF secreted by primary ovarian fibroblasts were
comparable to their immortalized counterpart (Figure 2a & b). Similarly, HGF levels were
high in the stromal compartment of normal ovaries (Supplementary Figure S1) and lower in
the tumor stroma, although some tumor samples with extensive stromal components
expressed high levels of HGF (Supplementary Figure S1).

We next evaluated if extraneously added recombinant human HGF induces a similar
migratory response in ovarian cancer cells. All the cells responsive to IHFNO-303 fibroblast
and IHFNO-303M enhanced their migration upon exposure to recombinant HGF (100
ng/mL) with 3-, 4-, 9-, 11-, and 1.6-fold increase in OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR5, PEO1,
and SKOV3 cells, respectively, compared to their basal levels (Figure 2c). This HGFinduced cell migration was effectively inhibited by a HGF neutralizing antibody (Figure 2c),
making no significant difference compared to non-stimulated cells. As observed with
fibroblasts (Figure 1a), recombinant HGF did not enhance the migration of OVCAR10 cells
(Figure 2c). Therefore, ovarian cancer cells responded to recombinant HGF similarly to
IHFNO-303 fibroblast (4 ng/mL of HGF level) but required higher levels; e.g., 25 times
more recombinant HGF was required to achieve similar increase of OVCAR4 migration by
IHFNO-303 fibroblasts (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure S2) and SKOV3 cells (Figure
2c). In OVCAR5 cells, recombinant HGF-induced migration was lower at all concentrations
tested (2 to 200 ng/mL) compared to IHFNO-3O3 fibroblast and was not further enhanced
by increasing the concentration more than 100 ng/mL (Supplementary Figure S2). These
results suggest the possible contribution by other secretory factors produced by the
fibroblasts. Nevertheless, cancer cell migration stimulated by IHFNO-303 fibroblast and
IHFNO-303M were effectively blocked by a HGF neutralizing antibody in all responsive
cells (Figure 2d), further supporting that fibroblast-derived HGF is the primary growth
factor contributing to the enhanced cell migration. The same concentration of IgG antibody
did not affect cell migration (Supplementary Figure S3).

Author Manuscript

In order to examine other factors that might affect cell migration promoted by HGF,
recombinant HGF was added to the conditioned media of IHFNO-402 and IHFOT-208; two
fibroblast lines that produce undetectable levels of HGF and that weakly induce tumor cell
migration (Figure 1). Interestingly, a dramatic enhancement of HGF-induced migration
(Supplementary Figure S4a) was observed for both OVCAR5 and PEO1 cells (>2.5- and 8fold, respectively). This finding suggests that common secretory factors derived from
fibroblasts might affect cell migration induced by recombinant HGF. It is well established
that HGF binds to glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate (HS) (20) and this
type of post-translational modification can alter the biological activity of HGF (21, 22).
Therefore, we examined whether HS can modulate cell migration induced by recombinant
HGF in ovarian tumor cells. We observed that cell migration was reduced by the treatment
of IHFNO-303 CM with heparanse III which cleaves HS (Supplementary Figure S4b), while

the addition of exogenous HS along with recombinant HGF enhanced migration in
OVCAR5 cells (Supplementary Figure S4c). HS itself did not affect the cell migration and
the migration enhanced by the addition of HS was effectively suppressed by a HGF
neutralizing antibody (Supplementary Figure S4d), suggesting that stimulation of migration
attributed by HS is dependent on the presence of HGF.

c-MET expression levels were measured in the ovarian cancer cells and compared with their
migratory response to HGF. OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR5, PEO1, and SKOV3 cells that
migrated in response to IHFNO-303, IHFNO-303M, and recombinant HGF expressed cMET but OVCAR10 cells which were non-responsive to any source of HGF did not (Figure
2e). Some cancer cells, e.g., OVCAR5 and PEO1 cells, highly expressed phosphorylated cMET on Tyr1234/1235 and Tyr1003 but their constitutive level on Tyr1349 was relatively low
or undetectable (Figure 2e). c-MET expressing cancer cells also increased their cell
proliferation in response to recombinant HGF (Supplementary Figure S5).

We next examined that IHFNO-303 conditioned media (IHFNO-303 CM) containing
fibroblast-derived HGF and recombinant HGF similarly induce c-MET signaling in ovarian
cancer cells that express c-MET. In OVCAR4 cells, c-MET was not phosphorylated without
HGF (Figure 3). All tested c-MET phosphorylation sites, Tyr1234/1235, Tyr1003, and Tyr1349,
were phosphorylated upon exposure to both IHFNO-303 CM and recombinant HGF but not
IHFOT-208 CM which contains undetectable level of HGF (Figure 2a). Phosphorylation of
c-MET (all three sites) was detected as early as 5 min following treatment and reached the
maximum level between 30 min to 2 hr and lasted until 24 hr. OVCAR4 cells constitutively
expressed p-AKT and p-ERK at low levels but the increase of phosphorylation on both AKT
and ERK was apparent 30 min after treating cells with either source of HGF and lasted until
24 hr. IHFOT-208 CM appeared to also activate AKT and ERK independent of c-MET and
to a lesser degree compared to IHFNO-303, suggesting the presence of additional
stimulatory growth factors secreted by the fibroblasts. Similar patterns of c-MET activation
in response to IHFNO-303 CM, recombinant HGF, and IHFOT-208 CM were observed in
OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cell lines (Supplementary Figure S6). However, AKT and ERK
activation induced by HGF was less apparent in cells with constitutively high level of pAKT and p-ERK and therefore, phosphorylation of AKT and ERK might not be a good
indicator of c-MET activation. In OVCAR5 cells where c-MET is constitutively
phosphorylated (Figures 2e & 3), phosphorylation levels on Tyr1234/1235 and Tyr1003 were
not affected by IHFNO-303 CM although their levels were further elevated by recombinant
HGF. In contrast, phosphorylation of c-MET on Tyr1349 was highly induced by both
IHFNO-303 CM and HGF, subsequently increasing both p-AKT and p-ERK levels. Similar
patterns were observed in PEO1 cells that also possess constitutive c-MET phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure S6).

DCC-2701, a small molecule of c-MET inhibitor, effectively inhibits c-MET activation
induced by HGF-providing microenvironment

Author Manuscript

The effect of DCC-2701, a novel c-MET/TIE-2 inhibitor currently in development (23) was
tested on c-MET-mediated signal transduction in OVCAR5 and PEO1 cells that
constitutively express phosphorylated c-MET. Cells were treated with serum free media or
IHFNO-303 CM containing DCC-2701 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 µM for 1 hr.
Both constitutive (serum free) and HGF-induced (IHFNO-303 CM) c-MET phosphorylation
was effectively inhibited by DCC-2701 in OVCAR5 and PEO1 cells (Figure 4). DCC-2701
acted on all three phosphorylation sites tested, Tyr1234/1235, Tyr1003, and Tyr1349 (Figure 4).
It is noteworthy that c-MET on Tyr1349, the multisubstrate docking site, was highly induced
by physiological HGF and the HGF-induced phosphorylation was effectively inhibited by
DCC-2701. It was apparent that inhibition of phosphorylation on Tyr1349 by DCC-2701
resulted in subsequent suppression of AKT phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner in
OVCAR5 cells (Figure 4). The p-ERK level was not greatly affected by the drug treatment
(Figure 4) probably because these cells contain constitutively high expression of p-ERK.

Author Manuscript

Next, we examined the extent of c-MET inhibition by DCC-2701 over time. OVCAR5 and
PEO1 cells were maintained in serum free media or IHFNO-303 CM containing 1.25 µM
DCC-2701, a concentration sufficient to block the phosphorylation of all three c-MET
phosphorylation sites (Figure 4) for varying time periods up to 24 hr. Cells were also treated
with IHFNO-303 CM containing a HGF neutralizing antibody (2.5 µg/mL) to compare the
effect of two different types of c-MET/HGF inhibitors on c-MET signaling. DCC-2701
completely blocked both constitutive and induced c-MET phosphorylation at all tested sites
for up to 24 hr in OVCAR5 and PEO1 cells (Figure 5). The effect of DCC-2701 was more
apparent on cells cultured with IHFNO-303 CM (HGF-provided by stromal
microenvironment), completely abrogating c-MET Tyr1349 phosphorylation. In this
physiological condition, DCC-2701 effectively blocked the activation of c-MET and
subsequently inhibited phosphorylation of AKT induced by IHFNO-303 CM in OVCAR5
cells over 24 hr (Figure 5). In comparison, the HGF neutralizing antibody was not effective
in inhibiting activation of c-MET and its downstream effectors (Figure 5) probably due to its
function of sequestering secreted HGF rather than directly inhibiting c-MET activity.
DCC-2701 reduces the cell viability and migration capability activated by the HGFproviding microenvironment

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the effect of DCC-2701 on ovarian cancer cell growth, cells were cultured
within standard media or IHFNO-303 CM containing DCC-2701 in a concentration range
from 0 to 10 µM. Cell growth rate for 72 hr was estimated using the CellTiter Blue reagent.
DCC-2701 reduced the viability of ovarian cancer cells maintained in standard media, but at
high concentrations of drug (Figure 6a). Cell viability was more effectively reduced by
DCC-2701 when c-MET was maximally activated by IHFNO-303 CM; IC50 values 2 ~ 3
fold less when compared to standard media (Figure 6a). DCC-2701 at concentration of 2.5
µM inhibited cell viability by over 70% in IHFNO-303 CM compared to about 10% in
standard media in OVCAR5 and PEO1 cells that possess constitutive c-MET
phosphorylation (Tyr1234/1235, Tyr1003 but not Tyr1349). IHFNO-303 CM increased cell
viability in varying degree depending on cell lines, higher in OVCAR3, OVCAR4,

OVCAR5, and PEO1 (30–60%) and relatively lower in OVCAR10 and SKOV3 (10–20%)
(data not shown). In order to test whether the greater effect of DCC-2701 within
IHFNO-303 CM is due to the HGF-induced activation of c-MET, similar experiment was
conducted using standard media containing recombinant HGF (100 ng/mL) in OVCAR5 and
OVCAR10 cells that represent c-MET positive and negative cells, respectively. IC50 value
of DCC-2701 was 1.3-fold lowered in OVCAR5 cells by the addition of HGF in the
standard media whereas no difference was observed in OVCAR10 cells (Figure 6b). The
addition of a HGF neutralizing antibody (0.5 to 4 µg/mL) into IHFNO-303 CM did not
change the cell viability in OVCAR5, PEO1, and SKOV3 cells tested (Supplementary
Figure S7). DCC-2701 also significantly inhibited cell migration induced by IHFNO-303
CM in OVCAR5 and SKOV3 cells at lower concentrations than required to inhibit cell
viability (Figure 6c). Although DCC-2701 has activity against, VEGFR2, none of the lines
tested expressed detectable level of the receptor (data not shown).

DCC-2701 effectively reduces ovarian tumor growth in vivo
A xenograft nude mouse model, generated by subcutaneous inoculation of SKOV3 cells was
used to examine the anti-tumor effects of DCC-2701. After 28 days of treatment, the tumor
burden was significantly decreased by an average of 53% and 52% in DCC-2701 treatment
groups 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively relative to the vehicle-treated control group (p < 0.05)
(Figure 7). The toxicities of DCC-2701 was also assessed by monitoring body weight,
mortality unrelated to tumor, and clinical signs of mice in each treatment group. The doses
and schedules in the study did not cause discernible adverse effects for DCC-2701, as shown
by no significant loss (< 20%) of body weight (Supplemental Figure S8). No general signs
of toxicity were noted at necropsies of all remaining mice at the end of the study among all
groups (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

The c-MET/HGF axis has been an attractive therapeutic target in many types of cancers. In
ovarian cancer, cancer cells overexpress c-MET and high expression of c-MET is related
with an adverse prognosis (24). Moreover, some c-MET inhibitors tested (e.g., PF-2341066
and foretinib) effectively inhibited ovarian cancer development and metastases in animal
models (16, 17), implicating that the c-MET/HGF axis is a promising target in human
ovarian cancer. However, ovarian cancer patients did not benefit from the monotherapy of
AMG102 (a humanized HGF antagonising antibody), rendering early termination of the trial
(Martin personal communication). This discouraging result might be due to inefficient
penetration of the antibody and/or possible ligand-independent activation of c-MET in
ovarian cancer. These potential limitations in targeting HGF and delivery of antibody-based
therapy suggest that small molecule inhibitors targeting c-MET might be a better approach.
Therefore, we evaluated the activity of DCC-2701, a c-MET/TIE-2/VEGFR inhibitor on
ovarian cancer cell growth and migration. Given that c-MET and HGF typically act in a
paracrine manner, it is important to understand c-MET regulation and evaluate c-MET
inhibitors within the physiologically relevant microenvironment. We used human ovarian
fibroblasts and their derived ECMs to exploit the interaction of c-MET and HGF within
physiological context.

Most ovarian cancer cell lines tested expressed c-MET. Interestingly, c-MET expression was
limited to cells that possess epithelial cell characteristics (25) while the cells presenting
mesenchymal phenotypes such as OVCAR10 lacked expression (Figure 2e). In agreement
with our observation, A2780 cells that fall into mesenchymal cell category (25) did not
express c-MET (24).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Constitutive c-MET phosphorylation was observed in some ovarian cancer cells, e.g.,
OVCAR5 and PEO1, (Figure 2e) where the effect of IHFNO-303 CM was minimal on cMET phosphorylation sites, Tyr1234/1235 and Tyr1003 (Figure 3 & Supplementary Figure
S6). In comparison to cells constitutively expressing phosphorylated c-MET,
phosphorylation on Tyr1234/1235 and Tyr1003 were highly induced upon exposure to
IHFNO-303 CM in OVCAR3, OVCAR4, and SKOV3 cells that do not constitutively
express phosphorylated c-MET. More importantly, regardless of constitutive c-MET
phosphorylation status, IHFNO-303 CM greatly enhanced the level of c-MET
phosphorylation on Tyr1349 and subsequently increased the phosphorylation of downstream
signal transducers, e.g. AKT and ERK (Figure 3 & Supplementary Figure S6).
Phosphorylation of Tyr1349 and Tyr1365 in the carboxy-terminal tail creates a docking site
for the recruitment of multiple transducers and adaptors and therefore, is critical for
activation of downstream signaling (12, 26–28). Thus, our results suggest that ovarian
cancer cells with constitutively active c-MET, can be further stimulated via stromal derived
HGF. These results correlate with the dramatic increase of cell migration in response to
IHFNO-303 (fibroblast that secrete high level of HGF) and IHFNO-303M (ECMs derived
from IHFNO-303) in all cancer cells that express c-MET (Figures 1a & 2d). This is also in
agreement with the observation that c-MET activating mutations still depend on active HGF
to acquire their catalytic activity (29). In addition, it is important to point out that in cells
that possess constitutive c-MET phosphorylation, the level of phosphorylation on Tyr1349 is
a better indicator of c-MET activation as a result of stromal-epithelial cells interactions,
which is in agreement with a previous report (30).

Author Manuscript

Importantly, our studies suggested for the first time that c-MET targeted therapies maybe
more effective when c-MET is activated by stromal interactions (Figures 4 & 5). This is in
agreement with great increase of phosphorylated levels of c-MET on Tyr1349 and
subsequent increase of p-AKT and p-ERK levels under HGF-providing microenvironment
(Figure 3) and therefore, making cells more dependent on c-MET activity for their growth
(data not shown). DCC-2701 at the higher concentration (>5 µM) led to decreased cell
viability in OVCAR10 cells that are negative for c-MET expression, suggesting DCC-2701
might have some off-target effect at non-physiologic concentrations. However, at lower
concentrations (~1 µM) the effect of DCC-2701 appeared to be limited to c-MET expressing
cells that are maximally activated. Interestingly, in OVCAR5 and PEO1 cells that contain
constitutive phosphorylated c-MET, DCC-2701 (2.5 µM) inhibited cell viability by over 70
% in IHFNO-303 CM compared to about 10% in standard media. Greater effect of
DCC-2701 treatment within the HGF-provided condition might partially explain why
response to many c-MET targeting small molecules did not correlate well with c-MET level
alone (19). The HGF neutralizing antibody was only able to suppress the c-MET activation
to the constitutive level or higher and did not effectively abolish the induction of AKT
phosphorylation in OVCAR5 cells (Figure 5) and did not affect cell viability. Therefore, our

study suggests that the antibody-based therapy may not completely inhibit c-MET activation
and that partial inhibition might be sufficient to reduce cell migration (Figure 2d) but has
little effect on cell viability (Supplementary Figure S7).

Furthermore, we found that not all fibroblasts secreted high amount of HGF or have predeposited trapped HGF within the ECM (Figure 2a & b). In our studies fibroblasts that
secrete high level of HGF were all derived from normal ovary but not from ovarian tumors.
Tumor-derived fibroblasts (e.g. IHFOT-208) secreted HGF but measurable amounts were
detected only after concentrating their conditioned media (data not shown). We do not know
whether those fibroblasts produce less HGF or have defect of secretion as seen in fibroblasts
derived from pulmonary fibrosis (31). Similarly, stromal HGF levels were high in normal
ovaries in vivo (Supplementary Figure S1). High levels of HGF was also observed in some
tumor stroma (Supplementary Figure S1), but most noticeably in tumors that possess a high
proportion of stroma relative to tumor cells. Perhaps these tumor-associated fibroblasts are
part of the “invasive front” and that upregulation of c-MET activity in the tumor cells at the
invasive front contributes to the invasive phenotype. Another important finding from our
studies is that HGF derived from fibroblast was sequestered within ECMs (Figure 2a) and
ECM-derived HGF triggered the same biological response (Figure 2d). Recombinant HGF
can bind to ECMs, and proteases (e.g., urokinase-type plasminogen activators, MMPs) can
release and activate ECM-bound HGF (32). We speculate that incubating cells within a 3D
matrix at 37°C may induce some degree of protease-mediated ECM degradation which
causes the release of bound HGF (25). In addition, serine proteases and/or MMPs secreted
by cancer cells (25) might further increase the release of ECM-bound HGF and activation of
released HGF. This is the first experimental demonstration that HGF produced by fibroblast
is stored within ECMs and elicits biological response in interaction with cancer cells.
Binding of HGF to ECMs may be an important mechanism to enrich HGF in a local area
and provide the complexity of c-MET regulation (6). These results suggest that proteolytic
release of HGF from the ECM at the invasive front could provide a gradient for tumor
invasion at the border with normal tissue.

A caveat of our study was that exogenous HGF alone could not fully reproduce the
biological activities observed for fibroblast-conditioned media. For example IHFNO-303
enhanced tumor cell migration by 2- to 140-fold; however, migration induced by
recombinant HGF alone was significantly lower (Figure 2c & d). This observation suggests
that other factors in the conditioned medium might cooperate with HGF to induce migration.
We speculated that post-translational modification of HGF by glycosaminoglycan such as
heparan sulphate (HS) might contribute to this difference. It has been reported that HGF can
bind to HS (20, 33) and that the subsequent modifications could alter the biological activity
of HGF in wound healing and mitogenic activity (22, 34). As such we demonstrated that
treatment of HGF with HS could alter the cell migration capability of ovarian tumor cells
induced by recombinant HGF (Supplementary Figure S4). Although exogenously added HS
and HGF was inferior to the induction induced by fibroblast-conditioned media and HGF,
our results imply that post-translational modifications of growth factors such as HGF might
be one mechanism to promote tumor growth via factors produced by the microenvironment.
In addition, different sources of HS have different binding activity to HGF (21), suggesting

that HS derived from fibroblast may have a critical structural domain for the binding of
HGF. Thus, our data suggest that fibroblasts also secrete factors such as HS that can modify
the biological activity (e.g., stimulatory effect on cell migration) of HGF and further
contribute to tumor progression; however, additional proteomic based studies will be
required to fully characterize tumor-associated modifications of HGF.

In conclusion, ovarian cancer cells, regardless of their constitutive activated c-MET levels,
can be further stimulated via stromal derived HGF. The biological response induced by this
physiological HGF was effectively inhibited by a novel c-MET inhibitor, DCC-2701 in vitro
as well as in a xenograft mouse model of ovarian cancer. Overall, these studies suggest the
potential clinical value of DCC-2701 for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancers that
are dependent on or addicted to c-MET activity for their growth and that pTyr1349 levels
might be a good indicator of c-MET activation and likely response to targeted therapy as a
result of signals from the microenvironment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures and fibroblast-derived ECM production

Author Manuscript

Ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR5, OVCAR10, PEO1, and SKOV3
(35, 36) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 0.3 U/mL insulin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL
streptomycin. Primary fibroblasts (e.g. HFNO-303, HFNO-402, and HFOT-208) were
obtained as previously described (37) from human ovarian tissues or ovarian tumors under a
protocol approved by the FCCC institutional review board. Immortalized lines of
HFNO-303, HFNO-402, and HFOT-208 (IHFNO-303, IHFNO-402, and IHFOT-208,
respectively) were derived by stably introducing human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) and subculturing for more than 30 passages. Fibroblasts were evaluated for their
mesenchymal characteristics; e.g., negative for keratin and positive for α-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA), vimentin (Supplementary Figure S9). Fibroblasts were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a humidified
incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All the reagents formulated for media were purchased from
Mediatech, Inc. (Manassas, VA) except for insulin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).
In vivo-like 3D matrices were produced from immortalized fibroblast lines in 24-well plate
(50,000 cells per well), as previously described (38–41) and stored in phosphate buffered
saline at 4°C until used for both migration assay and measurement of HGF concentration by
ELISA.

Antibodies and drugs
Antibodies used for c-MET/HGF signaling were phospho-c-METY1234/1235, phospho-cMETY1003, phospho-c-METY1349, c-MET, phospho-AKTS473, AKT, phospho-ERK1/2,
ERK1/2, and GAPDH. All the above antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Anti-pan-keratin (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), antivimentin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and anti-α-SMA (Sigma-Aldrich) were used to
ensure the purity and fibroblast-like phenotype of isolated fibroblasts. Anti-HGF (goat

antibody) and goat IgG were purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) and
used as a HGF neutralizer or a negative control, respectively. Human recombinant HGF was
purchased from R & D Systems. A small molecule of c-MET inhibitor, DCC-2701, was
kindly gifted by Daniel Flynn (Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC. Lawrence, KS). Heparan
sulfate and heparase III were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell migration assay

Author Manuscript

The migration capacity of cancer cells was estimated using 24-well Transwell plates with
polycarbonate membranes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Ovarian cancer cells (40,000 cells/
well) were plated on the membrane (upper well). Prior to plating cancer cells, fibroblasts
(125,000 cells/well) were plated in the lower well and 24 hr after seeding, their media were
changed into serum free media and conditioned for 24 hr. Similarly, ECMs derived from
different fibroblasts produced (in the lower well) and stored were conditioned under serum
free media for 24 hr at 37°C before plating cancer cells. Whenever necessary, recombinant
human HGF and HGF neutralizing antibody were added at the lower well 1 hr before plating
cancer cells. For DCC-2701 drug treatment, both ovarian cancer cells and lower wells were
treated with the vehicle control (DMSO) or drug for 1 hr before assembling upper and lower
wells. Cells were allowed to migrate for 24 hr and the cells remaining in the top of the
membrane were gently removed using a cotton swab. Cells migrated onto the bottom side
were fixed and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich). Random nine
fields of stained nuclei per membrane were imaged at 10 X using Nikon 80i fluorescent
microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with image acquisition and processing
software, MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). The number of nuclei in
each field was counted and averaged. Data were expressed as mean ± SE from three
independent experiments.

Cell viability assay
Ovarian cancer cells (2,000–3,500 cells/well depending on cell lines) were cultured
overnight in 96-well plates. Cell viability was assessed after the addition of DCC-2701 or
vehicle control at the indicated concentrations for 72 hr using the CellTiter Blue Cell
Viability Assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). The number of viable cells was assessed
by the determination of a fluorescent end product (resorufin) at 590 nm as a result of
conversion of a redox dye (resazurin) by living cells for 3 hr using a fluorescent Infinite 200
PRO plate reader (Tecan US, Inc., Morrisville, NC).
Measurement of HGF concentration by ELISA

Author Manuscript

Tumor cells and fibroblasts were grown in 24-well Transwell plates as described above in
cell migration assay. Cell culture media (50 µl) from the lower wells were centrifuged at
10,000x g for 15 min to remove cell debris and examined for HGF levels using the
Quantikine Human HGF ELISA kit (R & D Systems) according to manufacturer’s
instructions.

Immunoblot analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were cultured as indicated and lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50
mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with both protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Diagnostics
Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rockford, IL). Equal amount of denatured proteins (30 µg per lane) were
separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (25).
Protein detection was achieved using Western Lightning TM Plus-ECL Enhanced
Chemiluminescence Substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
DCC-2701 Efficacy in an In Vivo Xenograft Mouse Model

Author Manuscript

All procedures were performed following the guidelines adopted by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Kansas Medical Center. Female athymic nude mice
(NCr-nu/nu8 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River. Five million SKOV3 cells in
PBS mixed with an equal volume of cold BD Matrigel™ Matrix High Concentration (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank of
each mouse. When tumor volumes reached approximately 100 mg on average at 2 weeks,
mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups and were treated as follows: 0.4% hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose vehicle control, oral gavage, once daily (n=10) or with DCC-2701 at 5, 10
or 20 mg/kg, oral gavage, once daily (n=10/arm). The treatment lasted 28 days, and tumor
volume and body weight were measured every 2 or 3 days, respectively. Tumor volume in
mg is calculated by the following formula: volume = (length × width2/2).
Indirect immunofluorescence staining

Author Manuscript

Tissue microarrays (TMAs) contain two independent 1 mm cores per normal ovary or tumor
were obtained and evaluated under a protocol approved by the KUMC institutional review
board. TMAs were subject to immunofluorescence staining to evaluate HGF expression
levels in the stroma of normal ovaries and tumors. Sections of TMAs were deparaffinised
and incubated with primary antibody (anti-HGF antibody, R & D systems) and secondary
antibody as described (25) after antigen retrieval treatment and blocking procedure. HGF
expression was visualized using Nikon 80i fluorescent microscope.
Statistical analyses

Author Manuscript

Two sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests (equivalent to the Mann-Whitney test) were
performed to examine if cell migration rates were changed (induced and/or suppressed) by
treatments compared to untreated condition (as shown in Figures 1a, 2c, 2d, and 6c) using R
(version 2.15.1). Two-way analysis of variance was conducted to determine if there were
significant effect of fibroblasts (ECMs), cancer cell and their interaction on secreted HGF
levels (used in Figure 2a). In order to examine the effect of DCC-2701 treatment on tumor
burden, one-way analysis of variance was performed with post-hok analysis by the method
of Shapiro-Wilk. P-values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant.

of cancer cells by ELISA. Culture media did not contain detectable level of HGF. Asterisks

derived from normal ovaries (HFNO-) and ovarian tumors (HFOT-). (c) Recombinant
human HGF (100 ng/mL) promoted migration of OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR5, and
PEO1 but not OVCAR10 cells. Cell migration induced by HGF was prevented by a HGF
neutralizing antibody (1 µg/mL). (d) IHFNO-303 fibroblast and its derived ECMs,

effectively inhibited by a HGF neutralizing antibody (1 µg/mL). (e) OVCAR3, OVCAR4,
OVCAR5, PEO1, and SKOV3 that increased migration in response to HGF expressed cMET but OVCAR10 cells, irresponsive to HGF did not express c-MET. c-MET
corresponding to 170kD and 145 kD is pro-form and mature form, respectively. Nonspecific band (110 kD) was also detected using the antibody for phosphorylated c-MET on

Induction of c-MET mediated signal transduction by conditioned media derived from

induced phosphorylation of c-MET on all phosphorylation sites, Tyr1234/1235. Tyr1003, and
Tyr1349 and subsequently increased phosphorylation of c-MET downstream signaling
molecules, AKT and ERK. In OVCAR5 cells that possess constitutive c-MET
phosphorylation, fibroblast HGF only increased the phosphorylation of c-MET on Tyr1349
without affecting the other sites, Tyr1234/1235 and Tyr1003. Increase of phosphorylation of
Tyr1349 was accompanied by enhanced activation of downstream signaling.

IHFNO-303 CM containing DCC-2701 in a range of 0 (vehicle control) to 10 µM and grown
for an additional 72 hrs. Cell growth was measured using CellTiter Blue reagent. Cell
viability relative to vehicle control (% inhibition) is shown. DCC-2701 more effectively
inhibited cell viability when exposed to fibroblast condition media (IHFNO-303 CM)
relative to media alone. (b) OVCAR5 and OVCAR10 cells that represent c-MET positive
and negative cells, respectively, were plated overnight. Media were replaced with freshly
prepared standard media or the media supplemented with recombinant HGF containing
different concentrations of DCC-2701. Cell viability was estimated as described in (a). (c)
OVCAR5 and SKOV3 cells were pretreated with DCC-2701 at the indicated concentration
for 1 hr and were allowed to migrate for 24 hr in the presence/absence of IHFNO-303
fibroblast in Transwell plates. Average number of migrated cells per field ± S.E. is shown.
Compared with (IHFNO-303 plus no drug), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p <
0.0005 (n=3; using Wilcoxon rank sum test).

Anti-tumor effects of DCC-2701 in a xenograft nude mouse model of ovarian cancer.
SKOV3 cells were implanted on the right flank of each mouse and tumor volume was
measure twice a week using a caliper. Vehicle control or different dose of DCC-2701 was
administered daily by oral gavage after the tumor volume reached about 100 mg (at 2 weeks
after cell implantation). The mean tumor burdens (mg, (L × W2)/2, L and W are orthogonal
tumor length and width, respectively) ± S.E. are shown. The final tumor burden of groups
treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg of DCC-2701 for 28 days was significantly lower (p < 0.05)
compared to the vehicle treated group. One mouse in the DCC-2701 treatment group at 10
mg/kg was removed from the analysis due to an inadvertent death related to the oral gavage.
