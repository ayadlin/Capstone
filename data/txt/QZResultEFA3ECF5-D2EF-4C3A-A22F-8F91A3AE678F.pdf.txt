ABSTRACT
Osteoporosis is a disorder of bone and its development is closely associated
with oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Chlorogenic acid (CGA)
has potential antioxidant effects and its pharmacological action in osteoblasts is
not clearly understood. The present study aimed to clarify the protective effects
and mechanisms of CGA on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in
osteoblast cells. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with H2O2 to induce oxidative stress
model in vitro. Cells were treated with CGA prior to H2O2 exposure, the intracellular
ROS production, malondialdehyde content, nitric oxide release and glutathione
level were measured. We also investigated the protein levels of heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1), the nuclear translocation of transcription factor NF-erythroid 2-related
factor (Nrf2) and the phosphorylation levels of Akt in CGA-treated cells. The results
showed that pretreatment of CGA could reverse the inhibition of cell viability and
suppress the induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. Additionally, it significantly
reduced H2O2-induced oxidative damage in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore,
it induced the protein expression of HO-1 together with its upstream mediator Nrf2,
and activated the phosphorylation of Akt in MC3T3-E1 cells. LY294002, a PI3K/Akt
inhibitor, significantly suppressed the CGA-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and
HO-1 expression. Reduction of cell death mediated by CGA in presence of H2O2 was
significantly inhibited by Zinc protoporphyrin IX (a HO-1 inhibitor) and LY294002.
These data demonstrated that CGA protected MC3T3-E1 cells against oxidative damage
via PI3K/Akt-mediated activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which may be an effective
drug in treatment of osteoporosis.

INTRODUCTION

enzymes, inducing apoptosis of osteoblasts and
inhibiting bone formation [4–6]. In terms of the possible
importance of ROS in bone metabolism, it is essential
for cells to effectively up-regulate antioxidants, decrease
ROS generation and scavenge free radical, which may
contribute to bone loss and antagonize osteoporosis.
Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2
(Nrf2), also known as NF-E2-like 2 (NFE2L2), plays
an essential role in the cellular defense against various
inflammatory and oxidative stress-induced diseases,
including osteoporosis, which is a transcription factor that
binds to antioxidant response element and regulates the

Oxidative stress is a crucial initiating factor in a
variety of pathological conditions including osteoporosis,
resulting from excessive generation of ROS or damage of
the anti-oxidative stress defense system in impairment of
osteoblastic bone formation [1]. Most of studies reported
that the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is associated with
oxidative stress in osteoblasts [2, 3]. Overproduction
of ROS disrupts the balance between oxidation and
antioxidant defense systems, leading to bone loss by
promoting lipid peroxidation and lowering antioxidant

RESULTS

production of multiple anti-oxidative enzymes [7–11].
Under stress conditions, Nrf2 dissociates from Kelchlike ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) and translocates
into the nucleus to activate the expression of antioxidantresponsive genes and induction of phase II detoxifying
enzymes, which is considered as a major regulator of
oxidant resistance and involved in the maintenance
of the cellular redox homeostasis, and elimination of
reactive oxidants and electrophilic agents [8, 10, 11].
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a well-known intracellular
inducible phase II enzyme, is involved in defense
against various oxidative-inducing agents, including
LPS [9], hydrogen peroxide [12], hypoxia [13] and
subsequent lethality [14]. Upon oxidative stress, HO-1
is up-regulated and enhancement of HO-1 expression is
potentially important in iron homeostasis, antioxidant
defense, and anti-resorption of bone [15–17]. The HO-1
gene is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level,
and transcriptional regulation of HO-1 protein expression
is mediated by Nrf2 activation [18]. In particular, a noncytotoxic pharmacological agent may maximize the
intrinsic anti-oxidant potential of cells and represent a
promising therapeutic intervention in treating a variety of
disorders related to oxidative stress and inflammation via
increasing HO-1 expression [18, 19]. Indeed, PI3K/Akt is
a key survival signaling pathway in governing the cellular
defense system against oxidative injury, and regulating
cell proliferation survival and apoptosis associated with
Nrf2 activation and HO-1 induction [20, 21]. Therefore,
the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a vital role in the Nrf2mediated antioxidant response, making it a potential
target of drug therapy by modulating Nrf2 as an upstream
signaling molecule.
So far, numerous polyphenols have been identified
and proposed as the therapeutic agents to counteract
oxidative stress-related diseases, which is involved in the
balance between the cellular production and elimination of
free radicals [22]. CGA, a type of polyphenolic compound
formed by esterification of caffeic and quinic acids, is
the major active ingredient found in many traditional
Chinese medicines such as Flos Lonicerae Japonicae
and Eucommia Ulmoides, and it is also abundant in
some fruits, dietary vegetables, and daily beverages like
coffee, pineapple, beans, strawberries and apples [23].
Previous reports have demonstrated that CGA exhibits a
wide range of diverse pharmacological effects, including
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-carcinogenic
activities [3, 24, 25]. However, the antioxidant effects
and molecular mechanisms of CGA in osteoblasts have
not been elucidated yet. Therefore, the present study
established an in vitro experimental model of osteoblasts
exposed to H2O2 to evaluate the effect of CGA on H2O2induced oxidative stress of the osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells,
and investigate whether CGA conferred an antioxidant
defense capacity via modulation of PI3K/Akt activity and
activation of Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions.

H2O2 inhibits MC3T3-E1 cells proliferation and
induces apoptosis
The results showed that the viability of MC3T3-E1
cells exposed to H2O2 was decreased in both time- and
dose- dependent manners (Figure 1A). MC3T3-E1 cells
were stained with DCFH-DA to assess the effect of
H2O2 on the intracellular ROS production. Intracellular
ROS production significantly increased with passage
of time in H2O2-treated MC3T3-E1 cells (Figure 1B).
Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the apoptotic
osteoblasts increased with the increase of the dose of H2O2
(Figure 1C). As observed under microscope, treatment
with H2O2 (400 μM) for 4 h resulted in significant cell
shrinkage and a decrease in the rate of cellular attachment
compared to the control group (Figure 1D). According to
the results, the concentration (400 μM) of H2O2 for 4 h
was chosen to be the model condition of oxidative stress
in osteoblast cells for further research.

CGA promotes MC3T3-E1 cells proliferation
Cell viability was tested after being treated with
different concentrations (0, 5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 μM)
of CGA for 24 and 48 h. Various concentrations of CGA
had a marked role in promoting cell proliferation without
cytotoxicity, and this effect was in a time- and dosedependent manner in the range of 25 to 400 μM (Figure 2).

CGA improves cell viability and reduces
MC3T3-E1 apoptosis after H2O2 exposure
The results demonstrated that H2O2 exposure
markedly reduced cell viability, which was attenuated by
CGA treatment (Figure 3A). The results of cell apoptosis
detection by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI double
staining showed that after exposure to H2O2 for 4 h, CGA
lowered apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B,
3C). Compared with the control group, exposure to 400
μM H2O2 for 4 h activated caspase-3 of the MC3T3-E1
cells. CGA treatment was found to reduce caspase-3
activity in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). This
result suggests that CGA inhibited caspase 3-mediated cell
apoptosis induced by H2O2.

CGA inhibits H2O2-induced oxidative stress in
MC3T3-E1 cells
Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with H2O2 alone
clearly increased the levels of ROS, MDA and NO, and
decreased GSH content. In contrast, pre-treatment with
CGA significantly reversed the effect of H2O2-induced
ROS, MDA, GSH (Figure 4A–4D), and NO level
(Figure 4E) in a dose-dependent manner, respectively.

CGA increases HO-1 expression and it protects
oxidative stress in MC3T3-E1 cells

a dose- and time-dependent manner, while no significant
changes were found in the total Akt protein level (Figure
6C, 6D). These finding suggested that CGA-induced HO-1
expression and Nrf2 nuclear translocation, which may be
associated with PI3K/Akt signaling pathway

Western blot analysis demonstrated that 100 μM
CGA treatment significantly increased HO-1 protein level
in a time-dependent manner (Figure 5A). Furthermore,
cells were treated with various doses of CGA (0, 25, 50,
100 μM) for 3 h, and CGA concentration -dependently,
increased HO-1 protein expression (Figure 5B). ZnPP IX,
a HO-1 inhibitor, significantly reduced the expression of
HO-1 induction by CGA (Figure 5C). The increased cell
viability by CGA after exposure to H2O2 was significantly
inhibited by ZnPP IX (Figure 5D), indicating that HO-1
induction is responsible for increased cell viability with
CGA-pretreated cells under oxidative stress condition.

Role of PI3K/Akt on CGA-induced HO-1
expression and Nrf2 nuclear translocation in
MC3T3-E1 cells
Our results revealed that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt
pathway significantly suppressed Akt phosphorylation and
the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by CGA (Figure
7A, 7B). Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/
Akt significantly suppressed the protein level of HO-1
induced by CGA (Figure 7C).

CGA increases Nrf2 nuclear translocation and
activates PI3K/Akt pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells

Role of PI3K/Akt pathway on cytoprotection
induced by CGA in MC3T3-E1 cells

Western blot analysis showed that nuclear Nrf2
protein expression increased at 1 h, 3 h, and continued
to rise up to 6 h, whereas Nrf2 protein in the cytoplasm
decreased at 3 h, 6 h, and continued to rise up to 12 h
compared with the control group (Figure 6A). CGA
concentration-dependently induced translocation of Nrf2
from cytosol to nucleus (Figure 6B). Our data showed that
CGA treatment notably enhanced Akt phosphorylation in

LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, abolished
the protective effect of CGA against H2O2-induced

(Figure 8), indicating that the protective role of CGA
was through the PI3K/Akt pathway, a vital upstream
signaling pathway that mediated the Nrf2-related
cytoprotective effect.

DISCUSSION

efficiently inhibits osteoblast apoptosis and ameliorates
hormone-induced femoral head necrosis [32]. Therefore,
the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of CGA
against oxidative damage were explored in the current
study. The MTT colorimetric assay showed that CGA
can increase the proliferation capabilities of osteoblasts.
Moreover, the results showed that CGA significantly
attenuated H2O2-induced cell damage through increasing
cell viability, decreasing apoptotic rate and caspase-3
activity in MC3T3-E1 cells.
MDA is frequently used to measure the degree of lipid
peroxidation, which is closely related to cell damage [33].
GSH is a vital antioxidant that scavenges hydrogen peroxide
and ROS [34]. When excessively produced, NO may react
with superoxide anion radicals, leading to the strong oxidant,
peroxynitrite, and destroying functional tissues [35]. In the
current study, CGA significantly decreased ROS and NO
production, and the content of MDA, while increasing the
level of GSH in MC3T3-E1 cells. These findings indicated
that blocking H2O2-induced apoptosis by CGA may be
mediated by an increase in antioxidant capacity, and/or the
prevention of oxidative stress.
HO-1, one of the pivotal cytoprotective enzymes in
cellular defense, is a key protein that plays an important

Several observational studies showed that ROS
production reduces the bone formation of osteoblastic
cells, decreases bone mass and alters bone microarchitecture in age-related osteoporosis or in secondary
osteoporosis [1, 4, 15]. H2O2, as involvement of oxidative
stress, may induce the self-generation of free radicals and
produce a wide range of damages including apoptosis,
necrosis or autophagy of various types of cells, including
osteoblast cells [26–28]. In this study, MC3T3-E1 cells
were exposed to H2O2 to perform a model of oxidative
damage, we found that treating MC3T3-E1 cells with H2O2
resulted in reduction of cell viability, ROS production and
apoptosis. Moreover, bone pathophysiology is highly
sensitive to ROS production, contributing to define the
cellular and molecular basis of the biological activities
of ROS [29]. Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that
exogenous administration of antioxidants should be
investigated as a potential approach to protect cells against
ROS for the treatment of osteoporosis. Previous studies
have revealed the antioxidant effect of CGA, effectively
scavenging free radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation
[25, 30, 31]. Recent report demonstrated that CGA

role in the cellular adaptation to oxidative stress inflicted by
pathological events in a wide variety of cells [7, 8, 12, 36].
Many investigations have confirmed that upregulation
of HO-1 contributes to the cellular defense mechanism
in response to oxidative insults [20, 34, 37]. The

present study showed that CGA treatment significantly
upregulated HO-1 protein expression in a dose- and
time-dependent manner, indicating that CGA exhibited
antioxidant activity by upregulation HO-1 expression.
Moreover, inhibition of HO-1 can partially reverse the

increased cell viability induced by CGA in the presence of
H2O2. These data clearly demonstrated that the increased
HO-1 protein expression in MC3T3-E1 cells is responsible
for CGA-induced protective effect against H2O2-induced
cytotoxicity, implicating that CGA confers protection
against oxidative stress by increasing HO-1 levels.
Nrf2 is known as an upstream mediator of AREdependent phase II enzyme expression [38]. The Nrf2
translocation has been further demonstrated to upregulate the expression of antioxidant genes [7, 36, 37],
which plays an essential role in the induction of HO-1 and
may provide a useful therapeutic approach to combating
oxidative stress. Furthermore, current study reveals that
the induction of HO-1 expression is mediated by Nrf2
activation in MC3T3-E1 cells [18]. Western blot analysis
depicted that CGA treatment significantly increased Nrf2
protein level in the nucleus from 1 h to 6 h and in a dose
range of 50 μM to 100 μM, which suggested that CGA
may up-regulate HO-1 protein expression by activating
Nrf2 signaling pathway. When MC3T3-E1 cells were
treated with CGA for a long period time (12 h), nuclear
Nrf2 dramatically decreased, which indicated that Nrf2
anti-oxidative stress pathway just adaptively responded to
CGA treatment in a short time.
Furthermore, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is
commonly involved in HO-1 expression and in Nrf2dependent transcription in diverse cell types in response

to oxidative stress and different stimuli [7, 33, 37, 39].
Therefore, the current experiments were designed to
determine a role for PI3K/Akt as a possible regulator
of cell survival in CGA-induced HO-1 expression.
In the present findings, CGA was found to increase
the phosphorylation level of Akt protein, suggesting
that enhancement of Akt protein phosphorylation may
contribute to the CGA-induced HO-1 expression.
However, LY294002, a specific PI3K/Akt inhibitor,
significantly suppressed the nuclear localization of Nrf2
and markedly blocked HO-1 protein expression in the
presence of CGA. Moreover, inhibition of PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway partially reverse the increased cell
viability and decreased apoptotic rate induced by CGA in
the presence of H2O2, it indicating that PI3K/Akt pathway
plays a central role in the mechanism of CGA-induced
Nrf2/HO-1 activation.
Our findings demonstrated that CGA activates
nuclear translocation of Nrf2, induces the expression
of HO-1, and reduces H2O2-induced cell death in vitro
via activating PI3K/Akt pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells as
shown in Figure 9. However, it has to be emphasized
that whether there is the same effect of CGA in vivo or in
other cell lines. Moreover, further investigations will be
carried out in the future to reveal that whether other redoxsensitive transcription factors and targets, such as activator
protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [8, 16],

microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Foster, California, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cellular apoptosis was determined using the
Annexin V-EGFP/PI Cell Apoptosis Detection Kit
(KeyGEN, Nanjing, China). Briefly, cells were plated
into 6-well plates and treated with LY294002, CGA or
H2O2 according to the experimental design. Following
each specific treatment, cells were harvested, then washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for
10 min. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 1× binding
buffer and transferred to sterile flow cytometry glass
tubes 5 μl of Annexin V-EGFP and 5 μl of propidium
iodide were added and incubated at room temperature
(25°C) in dark conditions for 15 min. Finally, detection
was performed using flow cytometric analysis according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Beckman, Fullerton,
California, USA).

Assay of Annexin V-EGFP/PI apoptosis

(HPLC) purity] was purchased from National Institutes for
Food and Drug Control (Beijing, China). 3- (4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dipheny l tetrazolium bromide (MTT),
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and Zinc protoporphyrin IX
(ZnPP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
(Sigma, USA). Minimum essential medium (α-MEM)
and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Gibco
(Grand island, NY, USA). Primary antibodies to HO-1
(Cat # ab13248), Nrf2 (Cat # ab62352) and corresponding
secondary antibodies (Cat # ab6721, Cat # ab6728) were

against Akt (Cat # 4685), and p-Akt (Cat # 4060) were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,
USA).

Measurement of ROS production
The level of ROS was detected by measuring
intracellular ROS formation using a ROS detection kit
(Beyotime, Haimen, China). Briefly, MC3T3-E1 cells,
cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h before treatment, were
pretreated with CGA (0, 25, 50, 100 μM) and then exposed
with H2O2 (400 μM) for 1 h to induce ROS production.
Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated
with 5μM 2′, 7′- dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA) for 30 min. Fluorescence staining was visualized
using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, IX71), and
fluorescence assays were measured and quantified using
a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan, Sunrise) at
excitation/emission 525/610 nm and a flow cytometer
(Beckman, Fullerton, California, USA) at excitation/
emission 488/525 nm.

Cell culture and treatment
The mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were cultured in α-MEM
medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics
(100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL streptomycin) at 37°C
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All cells were
washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, PH 7.2–7.4)
before incubation with CGA or H2O2. After reaching 85%
confluence, the cells were treated with medium containing
different concentrations of CGA (0, 25, 50, 100 μM) for 1,
3, 6 h before treatment with H2O2 (400 μM) for 4 h. ZnPP IX
(5 μM) or LY294002 (20 μM) was treated for 1 h before CGA
treatment. CGA, ZnPP IX or LY294002 were dissolved in
DMSO, and the final DMSO concentration was ≤ 0.1% (v/v).

Determination of caspase-3 activity
MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and
then treated with CGA (0, 25, 50, 100 μM) for 3 h prior
to 400 μM H2O2 treatment for 4 h. In brief, treated cells
were extracted using lysis buffer (Beyotime, Haimen,
China), and then the supernatants were collected and
incubated with the substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA (acetyl-AspGlu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide), which produces yellow pNA.
Absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (BioRad, Foster, California, USA) at a wavelength of 405 nm.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by MTT reduction
assay. In brief, MC3T3-E1 cells were pre-incubated with
α-MEM containing 10% FBS overnight in 96-well plates

group were lysed and prepared to determine MDA and
GSH contents using commercial colorimetric assay kits
(Beyotime, Haimen, China) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. In addition, culture supernatants were
collected and assayed to measure NO release using a NO
assay kit (Beyotime, Haimen, China). The results were
calculated with reference to a standard curve and expressed
as nM/mg protein for MDA and GSH and μM for NO,
respectively.

MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with the indicated
agents according to the experimental design. Total
cellular protein of MC3T3-E1 cells was extracted using
a total protein extraction kit (KeyGEN, Nanjing, China),
and nuclear and cytoplasmic extractions were prepared
using a nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (KeyGEN,
Nanjing, China), respectively. The protein content was
quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime,
Haimen, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred to a poly-vinylidine difluoride membrane
(PVDF, Millipore, MA, USA). After being blocked, the
membranes were incubated over night at 4°C with specific
primary antibodies. Then membranes were probed with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature and detection was performed by an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (ECL, Beyotime, Haimen,
China). The results were normalized to β-actin or PCNA
and analyzed using Image J (National Institutes of Mental
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, our results showed that CGA
protected MC3T3-E1 cells against H2O2-induced caspase
3-dependent cell death by decreasing ROS, MDA and
NO production, while increasing GSH content, it also
demonstrated that CGA augments the cellular antioxidant
defense capacity by enhancing Nrf2 nuclear translocation
and upregulating HO-1 induction, and that the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway plays a central role in this mechanism,
thereby protecting osteoblasts from oxidative damage.
