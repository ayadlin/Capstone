ABSTRACT
MicroRNA array analysis revealed that miR-217 expression was decreased in
anti-cancer drug-resistant Malme3MR cancer cells. CAGE, a cancer/testis antigen,
was predicted as a target of miR-217. Luciferase activity and ChIP assays revealed
a negative feedback relationship between CAGE and miR-217. miR-217 and CAGE
oppositely regulated the response to anti-cancer drugs such as taxol, gefitinib and
trastuzumab, an inhibitor of HER2. miR-217 negatively regulated the tumorigenic,
metastatic, angiogenic, migration and invasion potential of cancer cells. The xenograft
of Malme3MR cells showed an increased expression of pEGFRY845. CAGE and miR-217
inhibitor regulated the expression of pEGFRY845. CAGE showed interactions with EGFR
and HER2 and regulated the in vivo sensitivity to trastuzumab. The down-regulation
of EGFR or HER2 enhanced the sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. CAGE showed direct
regulation of HER2 and was necessary for the interaction between EGFR and HER2 in
Malme3MR cells. miR-217 inhibitor induced interactions of CAGE with EGFR and HER2
in Malme3M cells. The inhibition of EGFR by CAGE-binding GTGKT peptide enhanced
the sensitivity to gefitinib and trastuzumab and prevented interactions of EGFR with
CAGE and HER2. Our results show that miR-217-CAGE feedback loop serves as a
target for overcoming resistance to various anti-cancer drugs, including EGFR and
HER2 inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

B-cell lymphomagenesis [7]. The over expressed TGF-β1
in inflammation triggers the deregulation of the miR-217SIRT1 pathway and then promotes the EMT process, which
might be involved in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer
[8]. Human cytomegalo virus infection of endothelial cells
induces angiogenesis by miR-217/SIRT1 and miR-217/
FOXO3A axis [9]. miR-217 acts as an endogenous
inhibitor of SirT1, which promotes endothelial senescence
[10]. miR-217 regulates E2F3 and inhibits invasion of
hepatocellular carcinoma cells [11]. miR-217 plays a tumor
suppressor role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma [12].
miR-217 regulates KRAS and function as a tumor suppressor
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [13]. TGF-beta activates
Akt in glomerular mesangial cells by inducing miR-217,
which target PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue),

miRNAs (micro RNAs) are a class of endogenous
21–23-nucleotide (in mammals) non-coding RNAs that
regulate the expression of target genes either through
translational inhibition or destabilization of mRNA [1–4].
miRNAs regulate tumorigenesis and cellular proliferation.
miR-136 plays a tumor-suppressive role by repressing
EMT and pro-metastatic traits via targeting Smad2 and
Smad3 [5]. Smad2-dependent inhibition of miR-30s in
podocytes is required for the activation of p53 and the
induction of apoptosis by TGF-β [6]. miR-217  downregulates the expression of a DNA damage response and
repair gene network and in turn stabilizes Bcl-6 expression
in germinal center (GC) B cells and also promotes mature

an inhibitor of Akt activation [14]. miR-217 functions as a
tumor-suppressive miRNA and inhibits the osteosarcoma
tumorigenesis through targeting WASF3 [15]. These reports
indicate roles of miRNAs in tumorigenesis and cellular
proliferation.
miRNAs regulate anti-cancer drug-resistance.
For example, miR-199a suppresses tumorigenicity and
multidrug resistance of ovarian cancer-initiating cells [16].
miR-27a reverses the multidrug resistance phenotype by
regulating the expression of MDR1 and β-catenin [17].
The miR-200 family regulates EMT and sensitivity to
paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells [18]. Over-expression
of miR-200c increases trastuzumab (Ttm) sensitivity
[19]. Ph (+) leukemia cells acquire resistance to tyrosine
kinase inhibitors via down-regulation of miR-217 [20].
miR-326, which is increased in anti-cancer drug-resistant
cancer cells, regulates the response to anti-cancer drugs
by forming a negative feedback loop with HDAC3 [21].
miR-217 acts as a tumor suppressor and regulates the
resistance to cisplatin in lung cancer cells [22]. Anti-cancer
drug-resistant breast cancer cells spread resistance capacity
to sensitive ones by releasing exosomes and that such
effect could be partly attributed to the intercellular transfer
of specific miRNAs such as miR-30a [23]. miR-30a,
miR-382, and miR-136  were down-regulated in
bromocriptine-resistant prolactinomas in comparison
with bromocriptine-sensitive prolactinomas [24]. miR-136
reverses cisplatin resistance by targeting E2F [25].
These reports indicate role of miRNAs in anti-cancer
drug-resistance.
EGFR serves as a molecular target for therapy of
uveal melanoma [26]. EGFR phosphorylation is associated
with chemo-resistance in colorectal cancer cells [27]. The
miR-200 family regulates sensitivity to EGFR therapy in
bladder cancer cells [28]. CD44-EGFR interaction leads
to an enhanced melanoma cell motility [29]. Because
anti-cancer drug-resistance is related with the enhanced cell
motility, it is plausible that EGFR may regulate the response
to anti-cancer drugs. CD44 induces chemo resistance in
breast cancer cells [30]. HER2 is expressed in a wide range
of human melanoma cells and serves as a target for T cell
mediated immunotherapy of human melanoma [31]. HER2
interaction with CD44 promotes gastric tumor progression
and metastasis [32]. CD44 expression levels are higher in
trastuzumab-resistant cell lines and its knockdown leads to
an increased response to trastuzumab [33]. Trastuzumabresistance is associated with the activation of EGFR
signaling [34, 35]. EGFR neutralizing antibody cetuximab
restores trastuzumab sensitivity of breast cancer BT474T798M cells and xenografts, suggesting that increased
EGFR ligand production was causally associated with
trastuzumab resistance [36]. These reports suggest that
EGFR activation is related with the resistance to EGFR
inhibitor and HER2 inhibitor.
CAGE, a cancer/testis antigen, is present in the
sera of gastric cancers [37], endometrial cancers [38]
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and patients with hematological malignancies [39].
Hypomethylation of CAGE increases the expression of
CAGE [40]. CAGE displays oncogenic potential and
regulates the expression of cyclins [41]. CAGE confers
resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs, such as taxol
and celastrol, by regulating the expression of p53 through
interaction with HDAC2 [42]. miR-200b forms a negative
feedback loop with CAGE and regulates the response to
anti-cancer drugs [43]. miR-200c, a member of miR-200
family, shows inverse correlations with EGFR
amplification [44]. DNMT1, a negative regulator of CAGE
[42], reduces cancer cell proliferation and migration by
inhibiting EGFR-Akt signaling [45]. This suggests the
role of CAGE in EGFR signaling. miR-200s negatively
regulates in vitro EGF/EGFR-mediated thyroid cell
invasion and in EMT in vivo [46]. These reports suggest
the role of CAGE in EGFR signaling in relation with anticancer drug-resistance.
In this study, we investigated the mechanism of
anti-cancer drug-resistance conferred by CAGE. miR-217
and CAGE formed a negative feedback loop and oppositely
regulated the response to anti-cancer drugs in vitro and
in vivo. We showed that miR-217 inhibitor increased the
expression of pEGFRY845 and induced the interactions of
CAGE with EGFR and HER2. We showed that CAGE
directly regulated the expression of HER2 through its
binding to the promoter sequences of HER2. Experiments
employing CAGE-binding peptide showed the importance
of EGFR activation in anti-cancer drug resistance conferred
by CAGE. We showed that the activation of EGFR, and
CAGE interactions with EGFR and HER2 were necessary
for the resistance to taxol, gefitinib and trastuzumab in
melanoma. Therefore miR-217-CAGE feedback loop may
offer valuable target for overcoming resistance to various
anti-cancer drugs such as taxol, EGFR inhibitor and HER2
inhibitor. The effect of CAGE on the response to EGFR
inhibitor and HER2 inhibitor and the mechanism associated
with it has not been reported.

RESULTS
miR-217 expression level is inversely correlated
with CAGE
We previously reported the role of CAGE in
anti-cancer drug-resistance [43]. We wanted to identify
miRNAs that would regulate the expression of CAGE.
miRNA array analysis showed that the expression level
of miR-217 and miR-335 was lower in Malme3MR cells
(anti-cancer drug-resistant cancer cells) than in Malme3M
cells while miR-326 showed higher expression level in
Malme3MR cells than in Malme3M cells (Figure 1A).
miR-326 forms a feedback loop with HDAC3 and regulate
the response to anti-cancer drugs [21]. Quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expression
level of miR-217 was lower in anti-cancer drug-resistant

cells (anti-cancer drug-resistant gastric cancer cells), than
in SNU387, Malme3M and AGS cells (Figure 1B). The
expression level of miR-217 was lower in MDA-MB231
cells, malignant breast cancer cells, than in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 1B). Immunoblot blot analysis showed that the
expression of CAGE, a cancer/testis antigen, was higher
in Malme3MR, SNU387R, and AGSR and MDA-MB-231
cells than in Malme3M, SNU387, AGS, and MCF-7 cells
(Figure 1C). Anti-cancer drug, such as taxol, decreased the
expression of miR-217 (Figure 1D) while increasing the
expression of CAGE mRNA (Figure 1D). Taken together,
these results imply that miR-217 may be associated with
the response to anti-cancer drugs.

wild type 3ʹ-UTR-CAGE, but not with mutant 3ʹ-UTRCAGE, in Malm3MR-miR217 and SNU387R-miR-217 cells
(Figure  2B). In SNU387 cells, the luciferase activity
associated with wild type 3ʹ-UTR-CAGE was lower than
the luciferase activity associated with pGL3-promoter
(Figure  2C). However, SNU387 cells did not affect the
luciferase activity associated with mutant 3ʹ-UTR-CAGE
(Figure  2C). miR-217 inhibitor increased the luciferase
activity associated with wild type 3ʹ-UTR-CAGE
(Figure  2C). Taken together, these results suggest that
miR-217 targets CAGE.

miR-217 negatively regulates the expression of
CAGE

Because miR-217 expression level was inversely
correlated with CAGE (Figure 1B and 1C), we examined
whether miR-217  would target CAGE. TargetScan
analysis predicted the binding of miR-217 to the 3ʹ-UTR
of CAGE (Figure 2A). Cells that stably express miR-217
(Malme3MR-miR-217 and SNU387R-miR-217) showed lower

We next examined the effect of miR-217 on

respectively (Figure 3A). qRT-PCR analysis showed that
Malme3MR-miR-217 and SNU387R-miR-217 cells also showed
lower expression level of CAGE at the transcriptional level
(Figure 3A). The over-expression of miR-217 decreased
the expression of CAGE in Malme3MR and SNU387R cells
(Figure 3B). miR-217 inhibitor increased the expression
of CAGE in Malme3MR-miR-217 and SNU387R-miR-217 cells
(Figure 3C). The down-regulation of miR-217 by miR-217
inhibitor in Malme3M cells increased the expression of

that miR-217 negatively regulates the expression of CAGE.

between miR-217 and CAGE. qRT-PCR analysis showed
that Malme3MR cells showed lower expression level of
miR-217 than Malme3M cells (Figure 4A). Malme3MR
cells stably expressing anti-sense CAGE (Malme3MRAS-CAGE
) showed higher expression level of miR-217 than
Malme3MR cells (Figure 4B). miR-217 promoter contains
binding sites for various transcription factors such as AP1,
SP1, YY1, C/EBP and GATA-1 (Figure  4B). Although
miR-217 promoter does not contain the potential binding
site for CAGE, we examined the possibility of the direct
regulation of miR-217 by CAGE. ChIP assays showed the
binding of CAGE to the promoter sequences of miR-217
in Malme3MR cells, but not in Malme3MR-AS-CAGE cells
(Figure 4C). The down-regulation of CAGE in Malme3MR
cells prevented CAGE from binding to the promoter
sequences of miR-217 (Figure 4C). Taken together, these
results suggest that miR-217 and CAGE form a negative
feedback loop to regulate the response to anti-cancer drugs.

CAGE directly regulates the expression of
miR-217
Because miR-217 expression level showed an
inverse correlation with CAGE (Figure  1B and 1C),
we examined the possibility of a negative feedback loop

(Figure  5A), suggesting that the increased expression
of CAGE is associated with the resistance to taxol and
trastuzumab. Malme3MR-miR-217 cells showed higher
sensitivity to taxol and trastuzumab than Malme3MR
cells (Figure 5B). miR-217 inhibitor induced resistance
to taxol and trastuzumab in Malme3MR-miR-217 cells
(Figure 5B). miR-217 inhibitor increased the expression

of CAGE in Malme3MR-miR-217 cells (Figure 5C).
Malme3M cells showed higher caspase-3 activity in

response to taxol and trastuzumab (Figure 5D). miR-217

Because miR-217 regulated the expression of
CAGE (Figure 3B), we examined the effect of miR-217
on the response to anti-cancer drugs. Malme3MR cells,
but not Malme3M cells, showed resistance to anticancer drugs such as taxol and trastuzumab, an inhibitor
of HER2 (Figure 5A). CAGE increases the expression
of cyclinD1 in A2F and AP-1-dependent manner [41].
CyclinD confers resistance to trastuzumab [47]. We
hypothesized that miR-217 would regulate the response
to trastuzumab through its effect on the expression of
CAGE. miR-217 inhibitor conferred resistance to taxol
and trastuzumab in Malme3M cells while miR-217 mimic
enhanced the sensitivity to taxol and trastuzumab in
Malme3MR cells (Figure 5A). Taxol and trastuzumab
induced the expression of CAGE in Malme3M cells

assessed for weight loss. Five mice were used for the injection of each cell line. Each value represents an average obtained from five
mice of each group. Data are expressed as mean  ±  SD. Immunoblot of tumor lysates was performed. Immunohistochemistry staining

necessary for conferring resistance to anti-cancer drugs.
For this, we made a series of CAGE deletion constructs
(Figure 10A). These constructs increased the expression of
pEGFRY845, but not the expression of EGFR, in Malme3M
cells (Figure 10B). However, CAGE deletion construct
that completely lacks DEAD box domain (KH-1) did not
induce the expression of pEGFRY845 in Malme3M cells
(Figure 10B). The down-regulation of CAGE decreased
the expression of pEGFRY845 and MDR1 in Malme3MR
cells (Figure 10C). With the exception of KH-1construct,
CAGE constructs conferred resistance to taxol and EGFR
inhibitors such as cetuximab and gefitinib (Figure 10D).
CAGE constructs also conferred resistance to celastrol
(data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that
CAGE regulates the response to EGFR inhibitors through
its effect on the expression of pEGFRY845.

The down-regulation of EGFR increased caspase-3
activity in response to taxol, gefitinib and trastuzumab in
Malme3MR cells (Figure 11E). Full-length CAGE did not
prevent caspase-3 activity from increasing, in response
to anti-cancer drugs, in Malme3MR cells transfected
with siEGFR (Figure 11E). Taken together, these results
suggest that EGFR mediates anti-cancer drug-resistance
conferred by CAGE.

We next examined the effect of EGFR on the
response to anti-cancer drugs. The down-regulation of
EGFR enhanced the sensitivity to taxol, gefitinib and

in response to these anti-cancer drugs in Malme3MR

resistance to taxol in association with CAGE. CAGE
showed interactions with HER2 and EGFR in Malme3MR
cells (Figure 12B). Immunofluorescence staining showed
lack of expression of CAGE and HER2 in Malme3M cells
(Supplementary Figure S3A). CAGE showed co-localization
with EGFR and HER2 in Malme3MR cells (Supplementary
Figure S3B). The down-regulation of CAGE decreased the
expression of pEGFRY845 and HER2 in Malme3MR cells
(Figure  12B). Malme3MR cells transfected with siCAGE
did not show the interaction of CAGE with EGFR or HER2
or the interaction between EGFR and HER2 (Figure 12B).
Full-length CAGE, but not KH1 deletion construct, increased
the expression of pEGFRY845 and HER2, and induced
interaction of EGFR with CAGE and HER2 (Figure 12C).
These results suggest that EGFR and HER2 are necessary
for anti-cancer drug-resistance conferred by CAGE. Fulllength CAGE, but not KH1 deletion construct, conferred
resistance to trastuzumab in Malme3M cells (Figure 12D),
prevented caspase-3 activity from increasing in response to
trastuzumab in Malme3M cells (Figure 12E) and prevented
cleavage of PARP in response to trastuzumab in Malme3M
cells (Figure 12F). HER2 promoter contains potential
binding sites for HDAC2. CAGE, through interaction with
HDAC2, confers resistance to anti-cancer drugs [42]. This
led us to hypothesize that CAGE would bind to the promoter
sequences of HER2. ChIP assays showed the binding of
CAGE to the promoter sequences of HER2 (Figure 12G),
suggesting that CAGE directly regulates the expression of
HER2. Taken together, these results suggest that CAGE may
confer resistance to trastuzumab through its interaction with
and direct regulation of HER2.

Malme3MR cells showed higher expression

(Supplementary Figure S5A). Malme3MR-miR-217 cells
showed lower expression of CAGE and pEGFRY845 than
Malme3MR cells (Supplementary Figure S5A).
Unlike Malme3MR cells, Malme3MR-miR-217 cells did
not show the interaction between CAGE and EGFR
(Supplementary Figure  S5A). miR-217 inhibitor
increased the expression of CAGE and pEGFRY845 and
induced the interaction between CAGE and EGFR
in Malme3M cells (Supplementary Figure  S5B).
Malme3MR –miR-217 cells showed lower expression of
CAGE, HER2 and pEGFRY845 than Malme3MR cells
(Supplementary Figure S5C). Malme3MR –miR-217 cells
did not show the interaction between CAGE and
EGFR or the interaction between CAGE and HER2
(Supplementary Figure  S5C). miR-217 inhibitor
increased the expression of CAGE, pEGFRY845 and HER2
in Malme3MR-miR-217 cells (Supplementary Figure S5C).
miR-217 inhibitor also induced an interaction between
CAGE and EGFR and an interaction between CAGE
and HER2 in Malme3MR-miR-217 cells (Supplementary
Figure S5C). miR-217 inhibitor targets CAGE to regulate
the expression of pEGFRY845 and HER2 and interactions
of CAGE with EGFR and HER2 (Supplementary
Figure S5D). Taken together, these results indicate that
miR-217 regulates the response to EGFR inhibitors and
trastuzumab through its effect on the interactions among
CAGE, EGR and HER2.

The down-regulation of CAGE decreases the
tumorigenic potential of Malme3MR cells and
confers in vivo sensitivity to trastuzumab
Because CAGE conferred resistance to
trastuzumab in vitro (Figure  12D and 12E), we
examined the effect of CAGE on the in vivo response
to trastuzumab. Malme3MR cells showed in vivo
resistance to trastuzumab (Supplementary Figure S4A).
The down-regulation of CAGE decreased the
tumorigenic potential of Malme3MR cells and enhanced
in vivo sensitivity of Malme3MR cells to trastuzumab
(Supplementary Figure S4A). Immunoblot analysis
of tumor tissue lysates showed that the in vivo downregulation of CAGE decreased the expression of
pEGFRY845 and HER2 (Supplementary Figure  S4B).
Immunoprecipitation of tumor tissue lysates showed
that the in vivo down-regulation of CAGE prevented
the interaction of CAGE with EGFR and HER2 and the
interaction between EGFR and HER2 (Supplementary
Figure S4B). Taken together, these results suggest that
CAGE regulates the in vivo response to trastuzumab in

HER2 is necessary for an interaction between
CAGE and EGFR, and regulates the response to
anti-cancer drugs
The down-regulation of HER2 enhanced
the sensitivity to taxol, gefitinib and trastuzumab
(Figure 13A), increased caspase-3 activity (Figure 13B)
and PARP cleavage (Figure 13C) in response to these anticancer drugs. The down-regulation of HER2 decreased
the expression of pEGFRY845, but not CAGE or EGFR
(Figure  13D), and prevented the interaction between
CAGE and EGFR (Figure  13D). The down-regulation
of EGFR did not affect the interaction between CAGE
and HER2 (Figure 13D) or the binding of CAGE to
the promoter sequences of HER2 (Figure  13E). Taken
together, these results suggest that HER2  may confer
resistance to anti-cancer drugs by regulating the activation
of EGFR and the interaction between CAGE and EGFR.

probable that CAGE, through interaction with Sp1, binds
to the promoter sequences of miR-217  to regulate the
expression of miR-217. CAGE increases the expression
of cyclin D1 in an AP1 and E2F-dependent manner
[41]. It is probable that Sp1 may increase the expression
of cyclin D1. It is probable that miR-217  negatively
regulates the expression of cyclin D1. miR-217 negatively
regulates the tumorigenic potential (Figure 7A) and the
angiogenic potential of cancer cells (Figure 7C and 7D).
We previously reported that recombinant CAGE protein
enhances the angiogenic potential of cancer cells [43]. It
would be necessary to examine the effect of miR-217 on
the expression of angiogenic factors. miR-217 inhibitor
promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and

HDAC3 by negatively regulating the expression of SIAH2
[48]. Therefore miR-335 may negatively regulate the
expression of CAGE. It would be interesting to examine
the effect of mR-335 on the expression of DNMT1, Sp1,
GATA-1 and Elk-1. For better understanding mechanism
of anti-cancer drug-resistance, it would be necessary to
identify miRNAs that are regulated by CAGE.
ChIP assays show the binding of CAGE to the site

tumor stage, lymphatic invasion, vascular infiltration and
distant metastasis [50]. We show that miR-217 negatively
regulates the metastatic potential of cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure 1A and 1C). It would be necessary
to examine the effect of miR-217 on factors that regulate
the metastatic potential of cancer cells. This would be
helpful for better understanding of the mechanism of anticancer drug-resistance conferred by CAGE.
Taxol increases the phosphorylation of EGFR
[51–53]. EGFR inhibition enhances sensitivity to taxol
in prostate cancer cells [54]. PD168393, an inhibitor
of EGFR, potentiates cytotoxic effect of taxol against
prostate cancer cells [54]. These reports suggest that
taxol-resistance is related with the resistance to EGFR
inhibitors. Taxol increases the expression of pEGFRY845
in Malme3M cells (Figure 9A). CAGE increases the
phosphorylation of EGFR, but not the expression of EGFR
(Figure 10B). CAGE confers resistance to taxol, gefitinib
and cetuximab (Figure  10D). Src kinase inhibition
enhances antitumor activity of taxol in ovarian cancer and
taxol increases the expression of pSrc [55]. It is therefore
probable that src is responsible for the activation of EGFR.
It would be necessary to examine the effect of Src on the
phosphorylation of EGFR by CAGE.
EGFR interacts with HER2 [56] and high-level
expression of EGFR attenuates the effect of anti-HER2directed antibodies in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells
[57]. This implies that the resistance to EGFR inhibitors
is closely related with the resistance to HER2 inhibitor
such as trastuzumab. We show that the down-regulation of
EGFR enhances sensitivity to trastuzumab (Figure 11A).
Taxol increases the expression of HER2 as well as CAGE
(Figure 12A) and the expression of HER2 is regulated by
CAGE in Malme3MR cells (Figure 12B and 12G). HER2
promoter contains binding site for p53 (Figure  12B).
P53 negatively regulates the expression of CAGE (42).
It is probable that p53 negatively regulates the expression
of HER2 by binding to the promoter sequences of HER2.
HER2 interacts with CAGE and EGFR in Malme3MR
cells (Figure  12B). HER2 regulates the expression of
pEGFRY845 (Figure 13D). CDCP1 binds to HER2 through
its intracellular domain, thereby increasing HER2
interaction with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src,
leading to trastuzumab resistance [58]. Src kinase pathway
is involved in trastuzumab–resistance in HER2-amplified
breast cancers [59]. EGFR and HER2 are transactivated
by c-Src and MMPs [60]. It is probable that HER2,
through interaction with src, regulates the expression
of pEGFRY845. Given the fact that CAGE interacts with
HER2, it is probable that CAGE interacts with src. miR7 reverses trastuzumab resistance through its effect on
EGFR and Src kinase [61]. It would be interesting to
examine the effect of miR-7 on the expression of CAGE
and miR-217. It is probable that miR-7 may negatively
regulate the expression of CAGE.

CAGE-binding 269GTGKT273 peptide enhances
the sensitivity to taxol in Malme3MR cells (personal
observations). GTGKT peptide decreases the expression
of pEGFRY845 (Figure  14A). It would be interesting to
examine the effect of GTGKT on src activity. GTGKT
peptide may inhibit the interaction between HER2 and
src. For better understanding of the effect of GTGKT
peptide on anti-cancer drug-resistance, it will be
necessary to identify binding sites for GTGKT on CAGE.
Because CAGE regulates the expression of pEGFRY845
(Figure 12B), it is probable that CAGE displays kinase
activity. If so, it will be necessary to examine the effect
of GTGKT peptide on kinase activity of CAGE. Because
GTGKT peptide enhances sensitivity to gefitinib and
trastuzumab (Figure  14B), it is probable that GTGKT
peptide may negatively regulate the tumorigenic and
metastatic potential of Malme3MR cells.
Notch-1 is associated with the resistance to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors [62]. Trastuzumab increases Notch
activity, which leads to resistance to trastuzumab [63]. Notch
directly binds to the cyclin D1 promoter sequences to induce
the expression of cyclin D1 [64]. Malme3MR cells express
higher expression level of Notch-1 than Malme3M cells
(personal observations). It is probable that Notch signaling
regulates the expression of CAGE and the response to
EGFR inhibitors and HER2 inhibitors. It would be necessary
to identify miRNAs that regulate the expression of Notch-1
for better understanding the mechanism of anti-cancer drugresistance conferred by CAGE.
TargetScan analysis predicts the binding of mR495,-329,-338, and -362–3p to the 3ʹ-UTR of HER2.
miR-338–3p inhibits proliferation by regulating cyclinD1,
and HBx down-regulates miR-338–3p in hepatocellular
carcinoma [65]. It will be necessary to examine the effect
of miR-338–3p on the expression of CAGE, miR-217 and
HER2. It would be interesting to examine the effect of
miR-338–3p on the expression of transcriptional factors
such as Sp1, YY1, AP1 and GATA-1. miR-362–3p reduces
cell viability, and proliferation mainly due to cell cycle
arrest [65]. E2F1 serves as a target of miR-362–3p [66].
CyclinD1 expression is dependent on E2F1 [41]. It is
therefore probable that miR-362–3p negatively regulates
the expression of CAGE. ChIP assays show the binding
of CAGE to miR-362–3p promoter sequences (personal
observations), suggesting a negative feedback loop between
CAGE and miR-362–3p. It is probable that miR-362–3p
may regulate the response to gefitinib and trastuzumab.
Over-expression of miR-495 in glioma cells downregulates
the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and
inhibits retinoblastoma phosphorylation, and knockdown
of CDK6 results in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition
and inhibition of cell proliferation [67]. miR-495 targets
the 3ʹ-UTR of the MDR1 gene and reduces expression of
the MDR1 gene [68]. This suggests the role of miR-495 in
the response to anti-cancer drugs. It would be necessary
to examine the effect of miR-495 on the expression of

pEGFRY845, interactions of CAGE with EGFR and HER2.
The identification of more targets of these miRNAs will be
necessary for better understanding the mechanism of anticancer drug-resistance conferred by CAGE.
In this study, we show that miR-217-CAGE
feedback loop regulates the response to various anti-cancer
drugs, such as taxol, gefitinib, cetuximab and trastuzumab,
through regulation of EGFR activation and CAGE
interactions with EGFR and HER2. The effect of CAGE
on the phosphorylation of EGFR and on the interaction
between EGFR and HER2 has never been reported. The
effect of CAGE on the response to EGFR inhibitor and
HER2 has not been reported, either. miR-217-CAGE loop
serves as a target for the overcoming resistance to EGFR
inhibitors and HER2 inhibitors in melanoma patients.

UTR were obtained using the TargetScan program.

Cell lines and cell culture
Cancer cell lines (SNU387R, Malme3MR and AGSR)
made resistant to celastrol, a microtubule-targeting drug
were established by stepwise addition of celastrol. Cells
surviving drug treatment (attached fraction) were obtained
and used throughout this study. Malme3MR or SNU387R
cells that stably express miR-217 (Malme3MR-miR-217 or
SNU387R-miR-217) were also selected by G418 (400 μg/ml).
Malme3MR cells that stably express anti-sense CAGE
(Malme3MR- As-CAGE) were also selected by G418. Taxolresistant cancer cell lines (Malme3MR-Taxol) were made
by stepwise addition of taxol. Cancer Cells were grown
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 units/ml penicillin, and 100  μg/ml streptomycin
(Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained in 5% CO2 at
37°C. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
were isolated from human umbilical cord veins according
to the standard procedures [43].

Chemo invasion assays
The invasive potential of cancer cells was
determined by using a transwell chamber system with 8-μm
pore polycarbonate filter inserts (CoSTAR, Acton, MA).
The lower and upper sides of the filter were coated
with gelatin and Matrigel, respectively. Trypsinized
cells (5 × 103) in the serum-free RPMI 1640  medium
containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to
each upper chamber of the transwell. RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in
the lower chamber and cells were incubated at 37°C for
16 h. The cells were fixed with methanol and the invaded
cells were stained and counted. Results were analyzed
for statistical significance using the Student’s t test.
Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.

used.

Transfection

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR)

All transfections were performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Lipofectamine and
Plus reagents (Invitrogen) were used. The construction
of siRNA was carried out according to the instruction
manual provided by the manufacturer (Ambion,
Austin, TX). For miR-217 knockdown, cells were
transfected with 50  nM of oligonucleotide (inhibitor)
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The sequences used were:
5ʹ-UACUGCAUCAGGAACUGAUUGGA-3ʹ (miR-217
inhibitor); and 5ʹ- GCCUCCGGCUUCGCACCUCU-3ʹ
(control inhibitor).

Total miRNA was isolated using the mirVana miRNA
isolation kit (Ambion). miRNA was extended by a poly
(A) tailing reaction using the A-Plus Poly (A) Polymerase
Tailing Kit (Cell Script). cDNA was synthesized from
miRNA with poly (A) tail using a poly (T) adaptor primer
and qScript™ reverse transcriptase (Quanta Biogenesis).
The expression level of miR-217 or other miRNA gene was
quantified with SYBR Green qRT-PCR kit (Ambion) using
a miRNA-specific forward primer and a universal poly (T)
adaptor reverse primer. The expression of miR-217 was
defined based on the threshold (Ct), and the relative
expression levels were calculates as 2- [(Ct of miR-217)-(Ct of U6)]
after normalization with reference to the expression of U6
small nuclear RNA. For quantitative PCR, SYBR PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used in a CFX96
Real-Time System thermocycler (BioRad).

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well
plates and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v) for
10 min and then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100
for 10  min. Nonspecific antibody binding sites were
blocked by incubation with 1% BSA in TBST for 30 min.
Cells were then incubated with primary antibody specific
to CAGE (1:200; BD Biosciences), HER2 (1:200; Santa
Cruz), EGFR (1:200; BD Biosciences) or pEGFRY845
(1:200; Santa Cruz) for 2 h, followed by washing with
TBS-T three times. Anti-goat IgG-FITC (for detection
of pEGFRY845, EGFR and HER2) or anti-rabbit Alexa
Fluor 586 (for detection of CAGE) secondary antibody
(Molecular Probes) was added to cells and incubated
for 1 h. Cover slips were then washed and mounted by
applying Mount solution (Biomeda, Foster City, CA).
Fluorescence images were acquired using a confocal laser
scanning microscope and software (Fluoview version 2.0)
with × 60 objective (Olympus FV300, Tokyo, Japan).

pGL3–3ʹ UTR-CAGE
To generate the pGL3–3ʹ-UTR-CAGE construct, a
136-bp human CAGE gene segment encompassing 3ʹ-UTR
was PCR amplified and subcloned into the XbaI site of
pGL3 luciferase plasmid. The mutant pGL3–3ʹ-UTR-CAGE
construct was made with the QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Luciferase activity assay was
performed according to the instruction manual (Promega).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
Assays were performed according to manufacturer’s
instruction (Upstate). For detection of binding of
protein of interest to miR-217 promoter sequences,
specific primers of miR-217 promoter-1 sequences [5′GTAATATAATAAACAAGAAAACTTTTGGAAGTG-3′
(sense) and 5′- GTTTTCCTCCCTGCCAGCTTT ATT -3′
(antisense)], miR-217 promoter-2 sequences [5′-ACC

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded
tissue
sections
were
immunostained using the Vecta stain ABC Elite Kit (Vector
Laboratories). Tissue sections were deparaffinized with
xylene and washed in ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase
activity is blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide and H2O
for 10min. Slides were then blocked with 5% normal
goat serum in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T)
for 1 h. For immunohistochemistry, a primary antibody
to CAGE (1:100, Santa Cruz), MDR1 (1:100, Santa
Cruz), EGFR (1:100, Santa Cruz), pEGFR Y845 (1:100,
Santa Cruz) or IgG (1:100, Santa Cruz) was added and
incubation continued at 4°C for 24 h. After washing with
TBS-T, slides were treated with biotinylated secondary
antibody for 30 min. After washing, slides were incubated
in the ABC complex for 30 min, and then stained with

In vivo matrigel plug assay

diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma). For H & E staining,
tumor tissue samples were fixed in 10% (v/v) buffered
formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 μm, and
then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were
mounted using Fixo gum rubber cement (Mercateo,
München, Germany).

Seven week-old BALB/C mice (DBL Co., Ltd,
Korea) were injected subcutaneously with 0.1 ml of
matrigel containing the conditioned medium and 10 units
of heparin (Sigma). The injected matrigel rapidly formed
a single, solid gel plug. After 8 days, the skin of the mouse
was easily pulled back to expose the matrigel plug, which
remained intact. Hemoglobin (Hb) content in the matrigel
plugs was measured using the Drabkin reagent (Sigma,
USA) for quantification of blood vessel formation.

Tumorigenic potential
Athymic nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu, 5–6-week-old
females) were obtained from Orient Bio Inc. (Seoul, Korea)
and were maintained in a laminar air-flow cabinet under
aseptic conditions. All animal experiments were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Kangwon National University (KW-140707–1). Cancer
cells (1 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal
flank area of the mice. Tumor volume was determined
by direct measurement with calipers and calculated by
the following formula: length × width × height × 0.5.
To determine the effect of miR-217 inhibitor on in vivo
tumorigenic potential of cancer cells, control inhibitor
(40 μg/kg or 50 μM/kg) or miR-217 inhibitor (40 μg/kg
or 50 μM/kg) was injected following the establishment of
sizable tumor by Malme3M cells, via tail vein five times
in a total of 30 days. To compare the tumorigenic potential
of Malme3MR and Malme3MR-miR-217 cells, Malme3MR
or Malme3MR-miR-217 cells (1 × 106) were injected
subcutaneously into the dorsal flank area of the mice. To
determine the effect of CAGE on the in vivo resistance to
trastuzumab, scrambled siRNA (100 nM) or CAGE siRNA
(100 nM) was injected along with or without trastuzumab
(10 mg/kg), following the establishment of sizable tumor by
Malme3MR cells, via tail vein 4 times in a total of 25 days.

Intravital microscopy
Male BALB/c mice (6–8 week old) were obtained
from Daehan Biolink (Korea). In vivo angiogenesis was
assessed as follows. The mice were anesthetized with
2.5% avertin (v/v) via intraperitoneal injection (Surgivet,
USA), and abdominal wall windows were implanted.
Next, a titanium circular mount with eight holes on the
edge was inserted between the skin and the abdominal
wall. Growth factor-reduced matrigel containing the
conditioned medium was applied to the space between
the windows, and a circular glass cover slip was placed
on top and fixed with a snap ring. After four days, the
animals were anesthetized and injected intravenously
with 50 μl of 25 ng/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled
dextran (molecular weight, Mr ~2,000,000) via the tail
vein. The mice were then placed on a Zeiss Axiovert
200 M microscope. The epi-illumination microscopy
setup included a 100-W mercury lamp and filter set for
blue light. Fluorescence images were recorded at random
locations of each window using an electron-multiplying
charge coupled device camera (Photo Max 512, Princeton
Instruments, USA) and digitalized for subsequent analysis
using the Metamorph program (Universal Imaging,
USA). The assay was scored from 0 (negative) to 5
(most positive) in a double-blinded manner.

In vivo metastasis assay
Female athymic nude mice were used for the
studies. Malme3M Cells (106 cells in PBS) were injected
intravenously into the tail vein of 4-week old athymic nude
mice, and the extent of lung metastasis was evaluated.
Control inhibitor (50  μM/kg) or miR-217 inhibitor
(50 μM/kg) was injected intravenously into the tail vein
of athymic nude mice five times. After 4 weeks, the mice
were sacrificed and analyzed for the lung colonization.
The lungs were rinsed with PBS and then fixed and stained
with Bouin›s solution. After 24 h, the lungs were rinsed in
water to remove excess Bouin’s solution and the extent of
lung metastases was quantified. To determine the effect of
miR-217 mimic on the metastatic potential of cancer cells,
Malme3MR or Malme3MR-miR-217 cells (106 cells in PBS)
were injected intravenously into the tail vein of 4-week
old athymic nude mice. Control mimic (50  μM/kg) or
miR-217 mimic (50 μM/kg) was injected intravenously
into the tail vein of athymic nude mice five times. After
4 weeks, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed for the
lung colonization.

Endothelial cell tube formation assays
Growth factor–reduced matrigel was pipetted into
pre-chilled 24-well plates (200  µl matrigel per well)
and polymerized for 30  min at 37°C. The HUVECs
were placed onto the layer of matrigel in 1 ml of M199
containing 1% FBS. After 6 to 8 h of incubation at 37°C
in a 95%:5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2, the endothelial
cells were photographed using an inverted microscope
(magnification, × 100; Olympus). Tube formation was
observed using an inverted phase contrast microscope.
Images were captured with a video graphic system. The
degree of tube formation was quantified by measuring the
length of tubes in five randomly chosen low-power fields
(×  100) from each well using the Image-Pro plus v4.5
(Media Cybernetics, San Diego, CA, USA).
