ABSTRACT
Using microarray information from oro-pharyngeal data sets and results from
primary human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK) expressing Human Papilloma Virus
(HPV)-16 E6/E7 proteins, we show that p63 expression regulates signalling molecules
which initiate cell migration such as Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and induce
invasion in 3D-organotypic rafts; a phenotype that can be reversed by depletion of
p63. Knockdown of Src or FAK in the invasive cells restored focal adhesion protein
paxillin at cell periphery and impaired the cell migration. In addition, specific inhibition
of FAK (PF573228) or Src (dasatinib) activities mitigated invasion and attenuated the
expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), a pivotal MMP in the
MMP activation cascade. Expression of constitutively active Src in non-invasive HFK
expressing E6/E7 proteins upregulated the activity of c-Jun and MMP14, and induced
invasion in rafts. Depletion of Src, FAK or AKT in the invasive cells normalised the
expression/activity of c-Jun and MMP14, thus implicating the Src-FAK/AKT/AP-1
signalling in MMP14-mediated extra-cellular matrix remodelling. Up-regulation of Src,
AP-1, MMP14 and p63 expression was confirmed in oro-pharyngeal cancer. Since p63
transcriptionally regulated expression of many of the genes in this signalling pathway,
it suggests that it has a central role in cancer progression.

p63, a member of the p53 transcription factor
family, is essential for development of stratified epithelium
and limbs as inherited recessive mutations in the p63 gene
cause cranial developmental problems with cleft palate,
skin defects and hypoplasia of breasts in humans [5, 6].
Recent microarray studies have highlighted the oncogenic
properties of certain p63 isoforms in inducing epithelial
to mesenchymal transition, cell migration, extracellular
matrix (ECM) remodelling and invasion [7–9].
Aberrant activities of proteins regulating cell
motility can promote invasion. Genes from the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase family i.e. protein tyrosine kinase
2 (PTK2; which encodes focal adhesion kinase (FAK))
and Src are known regulators of cell migration [10, 11].
Activation of FAK (Tyr576/577) and Src (Tyr416) are regulated
by mutual phosphorylation events at the indicated
amino acids near cell-matrix adhesion sites, leading
to the formation of an activated Src-FAK complex. In
addition, Src activity is also regulated by phosphorylation

INTRODUCTION
Cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCC) are increasing globally by 600,000/annum.
A significant proportion of HNSCC are oro-pharyngeal
cancers and at least 25% of these cancers are associated
with the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection, in
particular HPV-16, which also causes cervical cancer
[1, 2]. Oro-pharyngeal cancer patients with HPV infection
respond better to the available therapies than the HPVnegative indicating a potential diversity in these cancers.
The oncogenic transformation of HPV-positive tumours is
believed to be triggered by integration of viral genome into
the host chromosome, leading to upregulated expression
of E6 and E7 proteins which are well known to degrade
p53 and retinoblastoma proteins, respectively. The E6 and
E7 proteins transcriptionally regulate many cellular genes
including the p63 family, which are overexpressed in oropharyngeal cancers [3, 4].

of the C-terminal negative regulatory Tyr530 site, as
point mutations or loss of C-terminal residues results
in constitutively active Src, which is often seen in
colon cancers patients [12, 13]. Studies with tumour
tissue arrays  have shown a direct correlation between
activated  Src-FAK complex and increase in tumour
progression [14–16]. The activated Src-FAK complex is
known to mediate the phosphorylation of scaffold proteins
like paxillin at Tyr118 to trigger the disassembly of focal
contacts, which is prerequisite for cell migration [17].
Cancer cells also secrete increased amounts of
proteinases like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which
degrade different components of ECM and basement
membrane to facilitate the invasion [18]. MMPs are zincdependent endopeptidases which are activated through
cleavage of their precursors either by proteases like
plasmin or other active MMPs including collagenases
(MMP1), gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), stromelysins
(MMP3) and membrane-type MMPs (MMP14). Most of
these MMPs are overexpressed in most types of HNSCC
and are linked with poor prognosis of the disease. Thus,
the signalling pathways regulating the gene expression of
these MMPs are critical in disease progression [19].
In the tumour microenvironment, the increased
presence of inflammatory mediators stimulate the
expression of MMPs through induction of either
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (JNK) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT
signalling pathways [19]. We have previously shown that
AKT, a serine/threonine kinase, regulates epithelial cell
migration and invasion [20, 21]. Despite these findings,
the underlying molecular mechanisms driving epithelial
invasion after HPV16 infection still remains obscure, and
is the focus of this study.
Here, we show that p63, Src, PTK2, c-Jun (activator
protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor) and MMP14 genes
are upregulated in patients with oro-pharyngeal cancers.
Using human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK) expressing
HPV16 E6 and E7 genes (E6/E7-HFK) we show that
increased expression of p63 promotes migration and
invasion in a Src-FAK-dependent mechanism. We further
identified Src as pivotal regulator of ECM remodelling via
AKT/AP-1/MMP14 dependent pathway.

(pBabe) HFK with early and late passage E6/E7-HFK
indicates that invasion only occurs in late passage cells
(>12 passages) (Fig. 1A and 1B), which is independent
of cell proliferation as confirmed by similar BrdU
incorporation in E6/E7-HFK (Supplementary Fig. 1A).
Furthermore, mitomycin-C (inhibitor of cell proliferation)treated late passage cells demonstrated higher rate of cell
migration (p <0.05) compared to the mitomycin-C-treated
control and early passage E6/E7-HFK (Supplementary
Fig. 2A and 2B) and indicated cell migration and not
proliferation is essential for invasion.
Analysis of mRNA (Fig. 1C) and protein (Fig. 1D)
levels of p63 indicated that p63 is upregulated in cells
expressing E6/E7 genes and further increased in late
passage population. Stable shRNA mediated depletion of
p63 (Fig. 1E and 1F) in late passage E6/E7-HFK resulted
in a significant decrease in the invasive incidents (Fig. 1G
and 1H) suggesting that p63 expression is pivotal for
invasion. In addition, transient knockdown of p63 isoforms
by two different siRNA molecules (Fig. 2G) in late passage
E6/E7-HFK impaired the cell migration suggesting that
p63 is required for a migratory phenotype (Fig. 1I–1K).

p63 transcription factors modulate cell
migration via Src-FAK signalling
Comparison of our previous genome wide ChIP-seq
analyses of p63 function [9, 23] with microarray analyses
of OPSCC [24] identified a number of p63 target genes
whose expression like that of p63 (Fig. 2A) was elevated
in both HPV positive, as measured by p16INK4A [p16+], and
HPV negative [p16-]) oro-pharyngeal cancers compared
to normal tissue [23]. In particular, we observed that
both HPV-positive and -negative OPSCC tumours had
elevated levels of Src and PTK2 (encodes focal adhesion
kinase (FAK)) genes (Fig. 2A), which were associated
with p63 binding sites detected by ChIP-seq in normal
cells [23]. Importantly, only the Src expression correlated
significantly with p63 levels in OPSCC tumours (Fig. 2B).
In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of total Src
were higher in late passage E6/E7-HFK compared to the
other cell populations, albeit total FAK and paxillin levels
were relatively unchanged (Fig. 2C and 2D). Src levels
correlated with a marked increase in the activation of
the Src-FAK complex as represented by elevated levels
of pFAK-Y397 (auto-phosphorylation), pSrc-Y416 and
pFAK-Y576/577 resulting in enhanced levels of pPaxillin-Y118
which is a well-known target of the activated Src-FAK
complex (Fig. 2D). In addition, late passage cells also
appeared to have high rates of focal adhesion turnover,
as suggested by increased cytoplasmic localisation of
paxillin and pFAK-Y397 (Fig. 2E). In contrast, control HFK
exhibited distinct peripheral localisation of paxillin, which
coincided with faint peripheral localisation of pFAK-Y397.
The early passage E6/E7-HFK exhibited an intermediary

RESULTS
p63 expression is required for invasion of late
passage E6/E7-HFK
To investigate the role of p63 in oro-pharyngeal
squamous cell cancers (OPSCC) we utilised transformed
HFKs expressing high risk HPV16 E6 and E7 genes, which
we have previously shown to invade into the collagen-I
plugs when cultured with retinoblastoma-depleted
fibroblasts [20, 22]. Importantly, comparison of control

phenotype with punctate membrane staining of paxillin
(Fig. 2E).
To confirm the correlation between p63 and
Src-FAK signalling axis, the transient knockdown p63
isoforms by two different siRNA molecules in late passage
E6/E7-HFK significantly reduced the mRNA and protein
levels of PTK2 and Src and attenuated their activities as
confirmed by depleted levels of pPaxillin-Y118 (Fig.  2F
and  2G). These results indicate that p63 transcription
factors regulate the expression and activities of FAK and
Src signalling molecules, which may explain the impaired
cell migration observed earlier after p63 knockdown.

passage E6/E7-HFK compared to normal and early
passage E6/E7-HFK (Fig. 4A), whereas, MMP14 levels
were elevated (p < 0.05) even in early passage E6/E7HFK compared to control and remained elevated in the
late passage population (Fig. 4A). These results were
supported by a gradual increase in protein levels of
MMP1 and 2 from non-invasive to the invasive population
(Fig.  4B). Importantly, while protein levels of MMP14
mirrored its mRNA expression, its enzymatic activity, as
reported by the presence of cleaved MMP2 protein and
extracellular MMP2-mediated digestion of gelatin, were
elevated only in the invasive late passage E6/E7-HFK.
This was also the case with MMP9 activity, which is
potentially activated downstream of MMP2 (Fig. 4B).
Since MMP14 is well known to regulate the
activities of MMP2 and MMP9 [25], we examined the
effect of transient knockdown of MMP14 in late passage
E6/E7-HFK (Fig. 4C and 4D). Depletion of MMP14
expression caused a marginal reduction in mRNA
and protein levels of MMP1 while having no effect on
the mRNA/protein expression of MMP2 and MMP9.
However, the extracellular activities of MMP2 and MMP9
were dramatically reduced in the MMP14-knockdown
cells (Fig. 4D). These results confirm the well known
cascade of MMP activation and illustrate the importance
of MMP14 [25]. Knockdown of MMP14, significantly
attenuated the invasive incidents (Fig. 4E and 4F) without
affecting cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 1C), thus
highlighting the significance of MMP14 expression in
driving invasion.

Src-FAK signalling regulates cell migration
and invasion
To confirm the role of Src-FAK signalling axis
in enhanced migration of late passage E6/E7-HFK, we
depleted Src or FAK expression in these cells by transient
siRNA knockdown (Fig. 3A and 3B). As expected since
Src activity is in part dependent on FAK activity, the FAK
or Src knockdown reduced pSrc-Y416 and pPaxillin-Y118
levels without altering the protein levels of total paxillin
and p63 (Fig. 3B) and resulted in impaired cell migration
compared to scrambled control (Fig. 3C and 3D)
indicating that Src-FAK signalling enhanced cell migration
through modulating the stability of focal adhesions. The
reappearance of paxillin at cell periphery after FAK or
Src knockdown confirms this notion and was similar to
control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3 vs Figure 2E). Since
p63 levels were unchanged in Src or FAK-depleted cells,
these results indicate that p63 is not a transciptional target
of Src-FAK signalling (Fig. 3B).
To ascertain the importance of FAK and Src in
invasion and since we had used short acting siRNAs
for the above experiments, we compared the effect
of the specific inhibitors of FAK (PF573228) and Src
(dasatinib) activities with control (DMSO), which
resulted in significant decreases in the number of invasive
incidents (Fig. 3E and 3F), with a minimal effect on cell
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 1B).

Src-FAK signalling regulates MMP14-dependent
ECM remodelling
Since specific inhibition of Src or FAK activities
inhibited invasion, we next sought to determine their
effect on the expression and activity of MMP14 since
Src-signalling can regulate MMP levels [26]. Transient
knockdown of FAK or Src (Fig. 5A) or specific inhibition
of their activities appeared to deplete the mRNA and
protein levels of MMP14 concomitant with reduction of
the MMP2-mediated digestion of gelatin, thus confirming
the attenuated MMP14 activity (Fig. 5B-5D). These
results indicate that Src-FAK signalling may modulate
the MMP14-mediated ECM remodelling by altering its
expression and activity.
To further test this hypothesis we compared the
effects of adenoviral-mediated wild type Src (Src-WT),
constitutively active (Src-531) or kinase dead mutant
(Src-KD) expression in early passage E6/E7-HFK, which
do not invade. Our results indicate increased number
of invasive incidents only in the Src-WT and Src-531
expressing cells (Fig. 5E and 5F), which was independent of
proliferation as confirmed by similar BrdU uptake between
all the groups (Supplementary Fig.  1D). Furthermore,
the Src-WT and Src-531 expressing cells show elevated

MMP14-mediated ECM remodelling is pivotal
for invasion
We have previously reported elevated levels
of MMP1 and MMP14 in tissue sections from oropharyngeal cancer patients and also identified MMP14 as
a direct p63 regulated gene in normal HFK [9, 22]. The
microarray analysis of oro-pharyngeal cancers indicated
increased levels of MMP1, but not MMP2, 9 and 14 in
these tumours compared to normal tissue (Supplementary
Fig. 4A) suggesting a potentially important role of MMPs
in invasion.
The mRNA analysis indicated that levels of
MMP1,  2 and 9 are upregulated (p < 0.05) in the late

mRNA and protein levels of MMP14 alongside elevated
levels of pSrc-Y416 and pFAK-Y576/577 which indicates the
formation of activated Src-FAK complex and confirms
that Src-mediated modulation of MMP14 expression and
activity is pivotal for invasion (Fig. 5G and 5H). Depletion
of Src or FAK did not affect p63 levels (Fig. 3B).

therefore suggesting the Src-FAK-mediated activation
of AKT signalling pathway (Fig. 6G). The reduction in
c-Jun and p-c-Jun-S73 levels supported our previous data
following the depletion of AKT (Fig. 6D) as their protein
levels were also depleted after Src or FAK knockdown
(Fig. 6G). These results indicate that Src-FAK signalling
modulates AKT activity, which in turn regulates the
activity of AP-1 transcription factors. Indeed, specific
inhibition of FAK and Src activities in rafts established
with the invasive population showed a pronounced
reduction in the nuclear staining of p-c-Jun-S73 compared
to vehicle treated control (Fig. 6H) and a subsequent
reduction in invasion as previous shown (Fig. 3E and 3F).
In addition, the cells expressing the constitutively active
Src-531 molecule demonstrated increased protein levels
of c-Jun and p-c-Jun-S73, which confirms the Src-mediated
AP-1 activation (Fig. 6I).

AKT activity modulates MMP14 levels via an
AP-1-dependent mechanism
We have previously shown that AKT signalling
regulates cell migration and expression of MMPs [21, 22],
so we investigated if AKT maybe downstream of the
Src-FAK complex. There were marginal and dramatic
increases in the levels of pAKT-S473 in early and late
passage E6/E7-HFK, respectively, compared to control,
although the total AKT levels were similar between the
groups (Fig. 6A).
Since c-Jun, an AP-1 transcription factor, can be
activated by AKT signalling pathway and it can regulate
transcription of MMP14 [26, 27], we determined the
expression and activity of c-Jun by analysing its total
and serine73 phosphorylation level, respectively (Fig. 6A
and 6B). This revealed that protein expression of c-Jun
increased in both early and late passage E6/E7-HFK
compared to the controls which was coupled with
incremental increase in c-Jun activation as measured
by p-c-Jun-S73 levels (Fig. 6A and 6B). Furthermore,
the microarray analysis of OPSCC indicated increased
levels of c-Jun in OPSCC compared to normal tissue
(Supplementary Fig. 4B).
Therefore, to explore the link between AKT,
c-Jun and MMP14, we compared effects of transient
knockdown of total AKT in late passage E6/E7-HFK.
Our results reveal significant decreases in the mRNA
and protein levels of MMP14 and c-Jun following the
knockdown of total AKT, which correlates with depletion
of p-c-Jun73 (Fig. 6C and 6D). Since p63 levels were
unchanged in AKT-depleted cells, these results indicate
that AKT  signalling may regulate MMP14 expression
via AP-1-dependent mechanism. Indeed, the transient
knockdown of c-Jun by two different siRNA molecules
significantly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of
MMP14 confirming this idea (Fig. 6E and 6F).

p63 transcription factors modulate the activation
of AKT/AP-1 signalling
Our earlier results have shown a reduction in
invasion after p63 knockdown. Since AKT activation is
pivotal for cell migration and invasion, the role of p63
in activating AKT/AP-1 signalling was investigated.
The transient knockdown of p63 by two different siRNA
molecules in late passage E6/E7-HFK inhibited AKT
activation as evident by diminished levels of pAKT-S473
although the total AKT levels remained unchanged
(Fig. 7A). The p63 knockdown also reduced the mRNA
and protein levels of c-Jun and MMP14, thus indicating
that these proteins are potential transcriptional targets of
p63 (Fig. 7A and 7B). In addition, rafts establish with late
passage E6/E7-HFK expressing stable p63 knockdown
demonstrated a striking disappearance of p-c-Jun-S73 from
the nuclei (Fig. 7C). Since cell proliferation remained
similar in the p63-depleted cells (Supplementary Fig. 1E),
invasion is due to both p63-mediated regulation of AP-1
transcription and activity.
Since p63 and c-Jun regulate expression of many
genes, further studies were designed to confirm the
link between these transcription factors and to study
their significance in relation to invasion. Transient
knockdown of p63 or c-Jun (Fig. 8A) in late passage E6/
E7-HFK depleted the protein expression and activity of
MMP14, and significantly reduced (p < 0.01) the invasive
incidents on rafts (Fig. 8A-8C) with minimal effects on
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 1F). The same was true
when we expressed the constitutively active Src molecule
(Sc-531) in the p63 or c-Jun depleted late passage cells
(Fig. 8A-8C), suggesting that p63 and c-Jun are required
for  invasion even in the presence of high levels of
activated Src. Presumably this activity maintains levels
of c-Jun and MMP14 for activation by Src-FAK/AKT.
While the knockdown of p63 reduced c-Jun levels in the

Src-FAK signalling modulates AP-1 via
AKT pathway
Since the activation of the Src-FAK complex
drives invasion in E6/E7-HFK in part by regulating the
expression and activity of MMP14, we explored the
connection between Src signalling and AKT-dependent
AP-1 activity. Transient knockdown of total FAK or Src
proteins in the invasive population dramatically reduced
pAKT-S473 levels without altering the total AKT levels,

late passage E6/E7-HFK, the reverse was not observed
which confirms that c-Jun is a target of p63 isoforms
(Fig. 8A). These results emphasize the role of p63 as an
upstream regulator of Src-FAK/AP-1 signalling through
transcriptional regulation and activation.
To further validate our in vitro results from primary
HFK expressing E6/E7 genes, oro-pharyngeal cancer
sections with known HPV status (as confirmed by two
independent methods i.e. p16 staining and chromogenic
in situ hybridisation (CISH)) were used to study the
expression and localisation of p63, c-Jun, Src and MMP14.
In normal epidermis adjacent to either HPV positive or
negative tumours, intense nuclear localisation of p63
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was found only in the basal epithelial cells, with staining
gradually fading in supra-basal epithelial population
indicating differentiation and stratification of the normal
epidermis (Fig. 8D). On the contrary, intense nuclear
localisation of p63 was found throughout both HPV
positive and negative tumours but was absent in the stromal
cells. Similarly, the nuclear localisation of c-Jun appeared
to be mainly in the basal and supra-basal regions of normal
epithelium adjacent to both HPV positive and negative
tissue and gradually disappeared due to stratification
(Fig. 8D). However, pronounced nuclear localisation
of c-Jun was observed  in HPV positive and negative
tumour areas and co-localised with p63 staining (Fig. 8D).

Quantification of the level of increase in tumour tissue of
both p63 and c-Jun is shown in Fig. 8D. In the stromal
compartment, intense nuclear staining of c-Jun was only
observed around the tumour areas of the sections, which
may reflect the presence of enhanced paracrine signalling
in the tumour microenvironment (Fig. 8D).
Oro-pharyngeal tumour sections were also stained
for Src and MMP14. Weak cytoplasmic staining for Src
and MMP14 was observed in the basal cells, but was not
present in the stratified layers of normal epithelium in the
HPV positive and negative tumour sections (Fig. 9A). On
the contrary, intense cytoplasmic/membrane localisation of
Src and MMP14 was observed in both HPV positive and
negative tumour areas and this is quantified in Fig. 9A.

migration in fibroblasts with peripheral reappearance of
large focal contacts [10, 11, 17]. Specific inhibition of
FAK (PF573228) and Src (dasatinib) activities impaired
cell migration and invasion in organotypic cultures, with
minimum affects on cell proliferation. Suppression of Src
and FAK activities in breast cancer support our data and
emphasise the Src-FAK-evoked cell migration is a major
event in the biology of invasion [11].
The pronounced expression and activity of MMP1,
2, 9 and 14 in oro-pharyngeal tumours and in the invasive
E6/E7-HFK indicates that MMPs have a significant role in
invasion. However, MMP14 is up-regulated in both HPV
positive and negative tumours suggesting that this pathway
is active in both types of cancer. Our knockdown studies
in E6/E7-HFK confirm that the MMP14 activity is pivotal
in driving invasion. This conclusion is of no surprise since
MMP14 is known to activate gelatinases and also acts as a
collagenase by digesting collagen-I, II and III to promote
invasion [31]. In addition, MMP14 also plays a key role in
potentiating cancer cell migration [32, 33]. These results
are in agreement with recent findings, which indicate
a poor 5-year survival rate in patients with increased
MMP14 expression regardless of HPV status and make
it a potential target since its selective inhibition blocked
tumour growth, invasion and angiogenesis [34, 35].
Since specific inhibitors of Src and FAK were
effective in reducing the number of invasions, we
hypothesised that the increased Src-FAK activity may
regulate expression and/or activity of MMP14. Gene
knockdown or inhibition of FAK and Src activities
attenuated the mRNA, protein levels and activity of
MMP14. While MMP14 levels are similar in early
and late passage E6/E7 expressing HFKs, only the latter
invade since only the late passage cells have increase
Src levels and activity. The importance of this is shown
when adenovirus-mediated Src-WT or its constitutively
active construct (Src-531) are expressed in early passage
E6/E7-HFK, which do not normally invade, enhanced
mRNA and protein expression of Src and MMP14
with concomitant increase in their activities resulted in
invasion on rafts. These results indicate that activated
Src transcriptionally regulates MMP14 levels and also
regulate its posttranslational modification and cytoplasmic
trafficking, which are paramount to its activity.
Recent studies in gastric carcinoma, breast  cancer  and
chondrosarcoma cells exemplify the Src-FAK-mediated
regulation of MMPs like MMP9 and MMP13 via
activation of AP-1 transcription factors like c-Jun and
c-Fos [36, 37]. In addition, active Src is known to directly
phosphorylate MMP14 at Tyr573 and promote its monoubiquitination at Lys581, which enhances its cytoplasmic
trafficking and increases cellular migration and invasion
through collagen-I matrix [38, 39]. In breast cancers,
activated Src-FAK signalling enriches the cell surface
with active MMP14 to promote metastasis, thus indicating

DISCUSSION
Here, we have shown for the first time that enhanced
expression of Src induces invasion in E6/E7-HFK by
(a)  destabilising focal adhesions leading to potentiated
cell migration; and (b) regulating expression and activity
of MMP14, a pivotal proteinase, via AKT-dependent
activation of AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun to promote
ECM remodelling. This is all controlled by p63 regulating
expression and/or activities of Src, FAK, AKT, c-Jun
and MMP14.
Recent studies analysing RNA-seq and microarray
data sets from HPV-positive and negative HNSCC have
shown an increase in the levels of several transcription
factors including p63 [28, 29]. We observed an increase in
p63 expression after the expression of HPV16 E6 and E7
genes in primary HFK. However, the induction of invasive
incidents was observed only in rafts established with late
passage populations of cells (>12 passages) suggesting
that p63-mediated genomic alterations are required for
the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells. Our
recent genome-wide analysis of p63 binding sites in HFK
identified many p63 targets, which are involved in several
pathophysiological processes including cell differentiation,
motility, proliferation and ECM remodelling [8, 9].
The high levels of PTK2 and Src, known regulators
of cell migration, alongside significant correlation
between Src and p63 in OPSCC tumours, implicates Src
signalling in the invasive of E6/E7-HFK. Although the
mRNA and protein levels of FAK were similar in the noninvasive and invasive population of HFK, its enhanced
autophosphorylation was only observed in the invasive
population and may be due to up-regulation and clustering
of integrins, which are also known targets of p63 [8, 30].
In addition, p63 appears to regulate the expression of
these tyrosine kinases as its depletion decreased levels
and inhibited the formation of activated Src-FAK
complex, thus impairing cell migration. These results go
hand in hand with previous studies on FAK-null mice
and Src knockdown cells, which also showed impaired

posttranslational modification and membrane localisation
are essential in MMP14-mediated invasion [40, 41].
To delineate the Src-FAK-dependent downstream
signalling pathways, which may induce the expression
of MMP14, we focused on c-Jun, since its expression
and phosphorylation transcriptionally regulate MMPs
and could be linked with tumour progression [36]. Since
p-c-Jun-Ser73 levels were higher in the invasive population
of E6/E7-HFK, it suggests an enhanced transcriptional
activity of AP-1 could induce MMP14 expression. Indeed,
ectopic levels of Src-WT or Src-531 in early passage
E6/E7-HFK enhanced the p-c-Jun-Ser73 levels and upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of MMP14.
In contrast, knockdown of c-Jun depleted the MMP14
expression and abrogated the invasion on rafts. Previously,
we had shown the AKT-mediated induction of MMP1 via
ETS2-dependent mechanism [22]. Since ETS transcription
factors regulate the expression and activity of c-Jun
in melanoma cells, AKT signalling may also regulate
expression and activity c-Jun [42]. Specific inhibition or
depletion of AKT reduced the mRNA and protein levels
of c-Jun and MMP14 and supported our hypothesis [43].
Our recent genome wide ChIP-seq analysis [9]
and the results presented here, identify MMP14 as target
of p63. Hence, we studied the role of p63 in regulating
the Src/FAK/AKT/AP-1/MMP14 signalling pathway.
Knockdown of p63 in the invasive population attenuated
the mRNA and protein expression and/or activities of
Src, FAK, AKT, c-Jun and MMP14 indicating that p63
orchestrates the Src-mediated invasion. Since the ectopic
levels of Src failed to induce expression/activity of
MMP14 in cells depleted of either p63 or c-Jun, it appears
that p63 and AP-1 transcription factors synergistically
regulate the expression of MMP14 (Fig. 9B) [44].
In summary, p63 drives invasion in E6/E7-HFK
by modulating Src-FAK signalling which (a) triggers
focal adhesion disassembly leading to cell migration, and
(b) evokes expression and activity of MMP14 resulting
in enhanced ECM remodelling. The combination of
specific inhibitors of Src or FAK with MMP14 can be of
therapeutic importance in a cancer that is overdue new
treatments.

PF573228 (Tocris, UK) or dasatinib in their respective
medium. Each organotypic raft was sliced in three parts
(approximately 1–1.5 cm each) before embedding in
paraffin and sectioned to generate three equal sized raft
sections. These sections were used for H&E staining and
immunofluorescence experiments. The invasive incidents
were quantified using the three H&E stained sections from
each raft and represented as invasive incidents/cm. This
was carried out for three independent rafts generated form
different HFKs cultures and statistics were performed
using the number of invasive incidents/cm recorded from
three independent experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Transient knockdown

Cell culture

50 nM of either non-specific (Scram) or specific
siRNA targeting total FAK, Src, AKT, c-Jun, p63 and
MMP14 (Supplemental Fig. 5) were used to knockdown
the target gene and protein expression in E6/E7-HFK as
previously described [23].

Site-directed mutagenesis and
adenovirus generation
The human wild type (WT)-Src construct
(pDONR223-Src)
(Addgene)
was
used
to
generate constitutively active (Src-531) and kinase dead
(Src-KD) constructs by introducing STOP codon after
Tyr530 and replacing lysine by  methionine  (K298M),
respectively,
by
QuikChange
II-Site-directed
Mutagenesis (Stratagene, UK) according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines [47]. After mutations
were confirmed by Bigdye terminator sequencing
reaction (Life technologies, UK), 5 μg of individual
constructs were recombined with the adenoviral pAd/
CMV/V5-DEST Gateway vector (Life technologies,
UK) using Gateway-LR Clonase-II enzyme mix (Life
technologies, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines. All recombinant adenovirus were generated
using 293T cells and were purified and titrated as
previously described [48].

Retroviral constructs and stable knockdown
The stable knockdown by shRNA molecules in
late passage E6/E7-HFK was achieved by retroviral
transduction of pSuper-retro-neo constructs (scram, p63).
The retroviral shRNA constructs were produced in 293T
cells by using the phoenix system as previously described
[22, 49].

Primary human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK)
expressing either control vector (pBabe) or HPV16
E6/E7 genes were cultured in Epilife medium (Life
technologies, UK) to generate early (<10 passage) and
late passage (>12 passage) cells [45]. The 3D-organotypic
rafts were maintained in the E-medium for 14 days as
previously described [46]. The late passage HFK cultured
as monolayer or on the rafts were treated with either

before introducing a scratch wound with a yellow pipette
tip. Three bright field images were taken immediately
after the scratch-wound was generated (time = 0 hr) and
again in the same field after 20 hours. The rate of cell
migration  was calculated by the formula: (wound area
at t  = 0 hr  - wound area at t = 20 hr)/20 for the three
areas of each scratch wound and represented as μm2/hr.
This was  carried out in three independent experiments
of scratch-wounds generated from three different HFKs
cultures and statistics were performed using data from all
the three independent experiments.

Small aliquots of cell suspension were mixed with
equal volume of 0.1% trypan blue for 5 minutes. The
mixture was pipetted on haemacytometer, and percentage
of viable cells was calculated by counting unstained cells
per 100 cells.

Microarray analysis
The HNSCC microarray analysis was carried out
as previously described [23]. Briefly, differential gene
expression analysis of Robust Multi-array Average
normalized data [24] was used to compare HPV-positive
and -negative tumours with normal tissue using a threeway ANOVA model incorporating tumour/normal, site and
HPV status.

RNA extraction and quantitative real
time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
RNA extraction was carried out using Trizol (Roche,
US) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For
qRT-PCR, RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA by
transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche, US)
and the relative mRNA levels of genes were measured as
previously described [23].

Statistics
Results were presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical
analysis was performed by using IBM SPSS 20.0 software
and comparing the mean by student’s t-test and one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnet’s post
hoc analysis. The P < 0.05 was considered to be significant
in all the experiment.

Western blotting
The protein levels of FAK, p63 (4A4), MMP1,
MMP2, BrdU (Santacruz Biotech), Src, pFAK-Y395,
MMP14 (Abcam), paxillin (BD biosciences),
pPaxillin-Y118, pFAK-Y576/577, pSrc-Y496, pAKT-S493, total
AKT, p-c-jun-S73, c-Jun (Cell Signaling) and β-actin
(Sigma-aldrich) were detected in whole cell lysates by
immunoblotting as previously described [50].

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Immunofluorescence

None

To study the cellular localisation of proteins,
monolayer of HFK was fixed (4% paraformaldehyde),
permeabilised and exposed to primary and speciesspecific secondary antibodies as previously described
[50]. To study proliferation, the rafts were pulsed for
16 hours with BrdU prior to sectioning. The antigens
in the raft and oro-pharyngeal tumour sections were
retrieved by heat induced epitope retrieval methods (tris
buffer, citrate buffer) and the proteins were visualised
through 20× magnification as previously described [49].
The intensities of staining were quantified by calculating
the Q-score for proteins in normal and tumour areas.
Q-score = Sum of (degree of intensity (-, +, ++, +++) ×
(% of tissue section))
