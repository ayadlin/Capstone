Abstract
The ALK kinase inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066) is clinically effective in patients with ALK-translocated
cancers, but its efficacy will ultimately be limited by acquired drug resistance. Here we report the identification
of a secondary mutation in ALK, F1174L, as one cause of crizotinib resistance in a patient with an inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) harboring a RANBP2-ALK translocation who progressed while on crizotinib
therapy. When present in cis with an ALK translocation, this mutation (also detected in neuroblastomas) causes
an increase in ALK phosphorylation, cell growth, and downstream signaling. Furthermore, the F1174L mutation
inhibits crizotinib-mediated downregulation of ALK signaling and blocks apoptosis in RANBP2-ALK Ba/F3 cells.
A chemically distinct ALK inhibitor, TAE684, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG are both effective in models
harboring the F1174L ALK mutation. Our findings highlight the importance of studying drug resistance
mechanisms in order to develop effective clinical treatments for patients with ALK-translocated cancers.

Introduction
Chromosomal translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have been detected in several human
malignancies including in anaplastic large cell lymphomas
(ALCL), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT), and
non–small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC; refs. 1–3). ALK
translocated fusion proteins include the entire ALK kinase
domain and lead to constitutive ALK kinase activity and
oncogenic transformation both in vitro and in vivo (3). Somatic
mutations in the ALK kinase domain, including at position
F1174L, have been detected in neuroblastomas and are also
transforming in vitro and in vivo (4, 5). These findings have led
to preclinical and clinical development of ALK kinase inhibi-

tors including PF-2341066 (crizotinib; ref. 6). ALK kinase
inhibitors lead to apoptosis in vitro and tumor shrinkage in
mouse models of EML4-ALK NSCLC (7, 8). To date, significant
clinical activity, including tumor shrinkage in 60% of patients,
has been observed in a phase I trial of crizotinib in EML4-ALK
NSCLC (9). Furthermore, clinical efficacy of crizotinib has
been observed in an IMT patient harboring an ALK translocation (10). However, despite these dramatic effects, as with
other kinase inhibitors, drug resistance (herein termed
acquired resistance) to ALK kinase inhibitors is likely to
emerge. An understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms will be important for the development of additional ALK
kinase inhibitors and/or combination therapeutic strategies.

Patients
The patients were treated in a clinical trial that was
sponsored by Pfizer. Tumor biopsies were obtained under
an IRB approved protocol. Both patients provided written
informed consent. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified using RNeasy minielute cleanup kit
(Qiagen).
ALK genomic analyses
The ALK kinase domain was sequenced from all of the
available specimens. Exon 23 of ALK was amplified from DNA
using exon-specific primers, PCR products cloned into a
TOPOTA vector (Invitrogen), transformed into bacteria, and
individual clones sequenced. The PCR primers and conditions

LSI ALK Dual Color) as previously described (11).

Flag-M2 agarose (Sigma-Aldrich). ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using the mouse monoclonal antihuman CD246 (clone: ALK1, DAKO) as previously described (11).

Expression constructs and cell culture
The full length RANBP2-ALK cDNA from patient A and the
EML4-ALK (variant 1) cDNA from the H3122 cell line were
cloned into pDNR-Dual (BD Biosciences). The F1174L mutation was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with mutant-specific primers according to the
manufacturer's instructions and as previously described
(12). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Retroviral infection and culture of Ba/F3 cell were performed
using previously described methods (12). Polyclonal cell lines
were established by puromycin selection and subsequently
cultured in the absence of interleukin-3 (IL-3). Uninfected Ba/
F3 cells or those expressing EGFR delE746_A750 or the JP1536
empty vector were used as controls.

Cell proliferation and growth assays
Crizotinib was provided by Pfizer. TAE684 was synthesized as previously described (7). Growth and inhibition of
growth were assessed by MTS assay according to previously
established methods (12). All experimental points were set
up in 6 to 12 wells and all experiments were repeated at least
3 times.

Antibodies and Western blotting
Cell lysis, Western blotting, and immunoblotting were
performed as previously described (12). Anti-phospho-ALK
(DF53), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and anti-total-Akt were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Total ERK1/2 and
phospho-ERK1/2 (pT185/pY187) antibodies were from Invitrogen. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-

Results and Discussion
We identified 2 patients with ALK-translocated cancers that
developed clinical acquired resistance to crizotinib. Patient A,
with IMT, achieved a partial response with crizotinib therapy
lasting 8 months but subsequently developed regrowth of
several tumor lesions and had these surgically removed (Supplementary Table S1; see ref. 10). Both pre- and posttreatment
tumor specimens had evidence of viable tumor, expressed
ALK by IHC, and contained an ALK translocation (Fig. 1A).
There was no evidence of ALK amplification in the posttreatment tumor (data not shown). This patient's tumor was
known to harbor the RANBP2-ALK translocation (10). Sequencing of the entire ALK kinase domain demonstrated that one

of the clinically progressing tumor lesions contained a F1174L
mutation (Fig. 1B). This was not detected by direct sequencing, or by cloning and sequencing of individual clones, in the
2 other progressing lesions, or by direct sequencing in two
other tumors that were clinically stable at the time of surgery
(Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, it was not detected in
the pretreatment tumor specimen even by cloning and
sequencing of individual clones (Supplementary Table S1).
Patient B, with EML4-ALK NSCLC, achieved a partial response
with crizotinib treatment but developed acquired resistance
following 5 months of therapy. At the time of progression, a
liver biopsy of a growing lesion was performed (Supplementary Table S1). EML4-ALK variant 1 was identified by RT-PCR,
but no secondary mutations in ALK were detected in the
acquired resistance tumor specimen.
We next evaluated the biologic impact of the F1174L
mutation. Both RANPB2-ALK and RANBP-ALK F1174L led to
IL-3 independent growth of Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 2A) but the

10040

growth was faster in the presence of the F1174L mutation.
This increased growth rate was mirrored by a greater baseline
ALK phosphorylation of RANBP2-ALK F1174L compared with
RANBP2-ALK (Fig. 2B) and by increased downstream AKT and
ERK 1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). The RANB2-ALK F1174L
cells were significantly more resistant to crizotinib (Fig. 2D)
and the F1174L mutation diminished crizotinib-mediated
inhibition of ALK signaling and blocked apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). We also introduced the F1174L
mutation into the background of EML4-ALK found in NSCLC
(3). Similar to RANPB2-ALK, the EML4-ALK F1174L Ba/F3 cells
grew faster (Fig. 3A), had a greater baseline ALK phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), and were more resistant to crizotinib growth
inhibition than EML4-ALK Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 3C). Consistent
with these findings on growth, greater concentrations of
crizotinib were required to inhibit ALK phosphorylation in
the EML4-ALK F1174L cells compared with those with EML4ALK alone (Fig. 3B). Collectively, our studies demonstrate that

the F1174L mutation imparts both biologic and drug resistance properties to cancers harboring ALK translocations.
Furthermore, patients with neuroblastoma harboring the
F1174L ALK mutation may have a transient or no clinical
benefit from crizotinib treatment using the current dosing
schedules (13).
Crizotinib is administered continuously daily (250 mg BID),
reaching a median through plasma concentration of 57 nmol/
L of free drug and is clinically effective at this dosing in ALK
rearranged IMT and NSCLC (9, 10, 13). Our preclinical studies
suggest that higher doses of crizotinib could be used to
overcome the F1174L-mediated resistance mechanism
(Fig. 2D). This could potentially be achieved using intermittent
administration of higher doses of crizotinib, to achieve a
higher Cmax, sufficient to inhibit ALK phosphorylation in
the presence of F1174L. Similarly, some imatinib resistance
mutations (including F359V, M244V, Q252H, and E355G),
many of which effect the conformational change in ABL, cause

www.aacrjournals.org

a relative drug resistance that can be overcome by higher drug
doses in vitro and in some cases clinically by using higher
doses of imatinib (14, 15). In order to develop additional
therapeutic strategies, we evaluated a structurally unrelated
ALK kinase inhibitor, TAE684, and the heat shock protein
(HSP) 90 inhibitor 17-AAG in the crizotinib resistant models
(7, 16). Although the F1174L mutation slightly increased the
IC50 for TAE684 against RANBP-ALK Ba/F3 cells (59 nmol/L
with F1174L; 22 nmol/L without), the IC50 was still substantially below the concentrations of crizotinib (IC50 200 nmol/L)
required to inhibit growth and ALK phosphorylation in the
parental RANBP-ALK Ba/F3 cells (Figs. 2B and D and 4A).
Similar findings were observed for EML4-ALK Ba/F3 cells
(Fig. 4A and data not shown). The effects of TAE684 on growth
were also mirrored at the level of ALK phosphorylation
(Fig. 4B). Recent clinical studies have identified antitumor
activity of the HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504 in ALK-translocated
NSCLC (17). We thus evaluated the effects of the HSP90

F1174L Ba/F3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of TAE684 for 6 hours. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG

selected other neuroblastoma mutations are shown in green, and the gatekeeper residue L1196 is shown in magenta. Note that F1174 is not in contact
with the ATP-binding cleft. Interestingly, these neuroblastoma mutations cluster along a helix formed in the activation loop (A-loop, colored orange)
in this inactive structure. The mutations may destabilize this helix to promote the active conformation. They may also affect the position of the C-helix (pink),
which is known to play a key regulatory role in some kinases. Figure is drawn from PDB ID 3LCT (18).

inhibitor 17-AAG in models harboring the F1174L mutation
(Fig. 4C). Ba/F3 cells with and without F1174L were equally
sensitive to 17-AAG in vitro (Fig. 4C). As many ALK inhibitors
are in preclinical development and several HSP90 inhibitors
currently undergoing clinical development, our findings provide direct therapeutic strategies for patients that develop
crizotinib resistance.
The structural basis for the crizotinib resistance of the
F1174L mutation is not entirely clear. Examination of the
recently published crystal structure of ALK in an inactive
conformation reveals that the F1174L mutation is not in direct
contact with the ATP-binding pocket, where both crizotinib
and TAE684 are expected to bind (Fig. 4D; see refs. 18, 19).

10042

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

Thus, the F1174L mutation is unlikely to confer resistance via
direct steric interactions. Crizotinib is known to bind an
inactive conformation of MET (20) and a recently released
crystal structure in complex with ALK indicates that it binds
a distinct inactive conformation in ALK (PDB ID 2XP2). The
activating F1174L mutation must promote the active conformation of the kinase and therefore may disfavor binding
of crizotinib analogous to some imatinib resistance mutations in ABL (14). A more definitive understanding of the
mechanism of resistance, and the differential effect of the
mutation on crizotinib versus TAE684, will require detailed
binding and structural studies of these inhibitors with the
F1174L mutant.
