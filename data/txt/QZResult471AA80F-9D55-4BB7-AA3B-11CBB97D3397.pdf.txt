Abstract
Notch pathway signaling plays a fundamental role in normal
biological processes and is frequently deregulated in many
cancers. Although several hypotheses regarding cancer subpopulations most likely to respond to therapies targeting the
Notch pathway have been proposed, clinical utility of these
predictive markers has not been shown. To understand the
molecular basis of γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) sensitivity in
breast cancer, we undertook an unbiased, de novo responder
identification study using a novel genetically engineered
in vivo breast cancer model. We show that tumors arising
from this model are heterogeneous on the levels of gene expression, histopathology, growth rate, expression of Notch
pathway markers, and response to GSI treatment. In addition,
GSI treatment of this model was associated with inhibition of
Hes1 and proliferation markers, indicating that GSI treatment
inhibits Notch signaling. We then identified a pretreatment
gene expression signature comprising 768 genes that is significantly associated with in vivo GSI efficacy across 99 tumor
lines. Pathway analysis showed that the GSI responder signature is enriched for Notch pathway components and inflammation/immune-related genes. These data show the power of
this novel in vivo model system for the discovery of biomarkers predictive of response to targeted therapies, and provide
a basis for the identification of human breast cancers most
likely to be sensitive to GSI treatment. [Cancer Res 2009;69

Introduction
The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in multiple
fundamental processes including stem cell maintenance and differentiation, cell fate determinations during embryonic development,
and proliferation (reviewed in refs. 1–3). Given these key functions,
it may not be surprising that deregulated Notch signaling has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of both leukemias and solid tumors.
Aberrant Notch1 activation causes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in mouse models, and activating mutations in
Notch1 have been reported in over 50% of human T-ALLs (4).

Among solid tumors, deregulated Notch signaling has been implicated in neuroblastoma, glioma, breast cancer (5–10), and others.
In human breast cancers, expression of Notch1 and Jagged1 are
associated with poor prognosis (11, 12), and loss of the Notch pathway antagonist Numb occurs frequently, leading to increased
Notch signaling (13). Therefore, inhibition of Notch pathway signaling using small-molecule γ-secretase inhibitors (GSI) could be
a promising therapeutic approach for breast cancer.
Several hypotheses regarding subsets of patients most likely to
respond to GSI therapy have been proposed. For example, the observation of frequent activating mutations in Notch1 led to the hypothesis that GSI treatment could be efficacious in T-ALL.
However, although Notch1 was inhibited in all T-ALL lines tested,
only a subset was sensitive to GSI treatment (4). Subsequent studies showed that mutational loss of PTEN is a critical determinant
of GSI resistance in Notch1 mutant T-ALL, revealing significant
cross-talk between the Notch and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways (14). In addition, mutation or homozygous deletion of the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 has been shown to lead to GSI
resistance in T-ALL (15), and it has been suggested that loss of
Numb expression could be a means of identifying tumors most
likely to respond to GSI (13). These results show that Notch signaling is complex, involving cross-talk with other signaling pathways,
and that predictors of response may be tumor context dependent.
To understand the molecular basis of GSI sensitivity in breast
cancer, we undertook an unbiased, de novo responder identification study using an in vivo preclinical breast cancer model. In this
transgenic model, breast tumors expressing human HER2 carrying
the oncogenic V659E mutation arise on an INK4a/ARF −/− background where both p53 and Rb tumor suppressor functions are
compromised (“BH” model; ref. 16). Each tumor is subsequently
resected and propagated into multiple animals as s.c. allografts,
enabling both molecular profiling and in vivo drug response determination on the same tumor (“BH” archive; ref. 17). We leveraged
this model to identify a pretreatment gene expression signature
that is associated with in vivo GSI efficacy. Pathway analysis was
used to show that this signature was enriched for Notch signaling
and inflammation/immune related genes. These data show the
power of the breast Her2 (BH) model for the discovery of biomarkers predictive of response to targeted therapies and facilitate the
prediction of which human breast cancers are more likely to respond to GSI treatment.

human Her2 (V659E) transgene using the reverse transactivator protein
under the control of the MMTV-LTR promoter. ES cells carrying these modifications were injected into 3-d-old C57Bl/6 mouse blastocysts, resulting in
chimeric mice made up of cells originating from normal and modified stem
cells. These chimeric animals, upon doxycycline administration, developed
invasive mammary adenocarcinomas with a 2- to 6-month latency.
Primary tumors from this model were surgically resected and minced.
Tumor cells were isolated using a cell strainer and in the presence of RPMI
(RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum w/pen-strep). Viable cell count was
determined and ∼0.1 × 106 cells per mouse were injected s.c. in NCR-nude
(Taconic Farms) animals for subsequent propagation in the presence of Matrigel (BD Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane, Phenol red free from BD
Biosciences). After two rounds of in vivo propagation, tumor material was
cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. To characterize the propagated and archived tumors, ∼0.1 × 106 cells from each individual tumor line were thawed
and injected s.c. in BalbC-nude animals (at least five mice per tumor line).
When the tumors reached a mean size of 500 to 800 mm3, animals were sacrificed and tumors were surgically removed for further characterization.
In vivo, maximum tolerated dose, and efficacy studies for GSI in BH
tumor models. The small-molecule cyclic sulfamide GSI, MRK-003 (18),
was administered orally as a suspension in 0.5% methylcellulose (Sigma)
for in vivo studies. A pilot dose tolerability, and efficacy study and identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the BH model were performed as described in the Results section. For efficacy studies, each tumor
line was injected into the s.c. space of a cohort of BalbC nude mice. Each

tumor model had at least 10 animals treated with vehicle and 10 animals
treated with MRK-003. Efficacy studies using BH450 were repeated thrice
throughout the large-scale efficacy study and used as an internal control.
Animals were treated weekly with MRK-003 at a dose of 300 mpk. Tumor
volumes were measured twice weekly using calipers, and gross tumor
weights were measured at the study end point.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
mouse breast cancer tissues were sectioned at 5-μm thickness. Sections
were analyzed for Ki67 (1:200, clone SP6, Neomarkers), rat anti-Hes1 antibody
(2 μg mL−1, clone NM1, MBL International), or rabbit anti-cow cytokeratin
(1:500, #Z0622, DAKO). Automated staining was performed using the ChromoMap kit on the Discovery XT (Ventana Medical Systems) under standard conditions (19). For quantification of Ki67 staining, percentage of positively
stained cells compared with unstained cells was calculated from 9 to 10 whole
tumor sections per vehicle or GSI-treated arm using Ariol imaging system.
Pharmacokinetic analysis. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture,
and ∼800 μL of blood was transferred into a microvial containing EDTA
as an anticoagulant. The blood was then spun to pellet and plasma was
collected and transferred into a 96-well plate for PK analysis. The MRK003 concentrations in mouse plasma were analyzed by high-pressure liquid
chromatography.
Gene expression profiling. Total RNA isolated from frozen tissues was
converted into fluorescence-labeled cRNA that was hybridized to DNA oligonucleotide microarrays as described previously (20, 21). Universal mouse
reference RNA from Stratagene was used as the reference and hybridized

Discovery of GSI Response Signature

with each individual sample on a custom mouse 44 k array. Ratios of transcript abundance in each individual sample versus pooled samples were
calculated with normalized intensity data. Gene expression data analysis
was done with Matlab (version 7, The Mathworks).
ANOVA and leave-one-out cross-validation to identify the responder
signature. Gene expression data for each tumor was expressed as a ratio relative to the mean profile of all samples. We first filtered out genes that did not
show significant variability by removing genes that had P value of >0.01 and
a fold change difference of <1.5-fold in all samples compared with the mean.
For each tumor, we calculated the statistical significance of drug response by comparing the mean tumor volume or mean tumor weight of
the samples in the drug-treated arm to the mean tumor volume or mean
tumor weight in the vehicle-treated arm. A t test was performed at the
study end point to derive a P value for both tumor volume and tumor
weight change. By thresholding on the P value for tumor volume and
weight change, we could define a responder group and nonresponder group
and perform ANOVA to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the two groups. Because the determination of a threshold to identify
responder and nonresponder groups is arbitrary, we used the following
procedure to determine the optimal threshold combination to use as the
criterion to call responders and nonresponders.
For both volume and weight change P value, we iterated through all possible combinations of thresholds of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1. For each
threshold combination, we used P < 0.01 and mean fold change of >1.3 to
identify genes differentially expressed between responder and nonresponder groups, and performed leave-one-out cross-validation, iterating through
all non–group 1 tumors (see Results for a description of group 1). For each
iteration, a set of genes was selected using all but one sample, and this set
of genes was used to predict the membership of the one sample that was
left out. The criteria for declaring responder and nonresponder were determined based on the maximal prediction power (72%) and the minimal false
discovery rate (14%).

Evaluation of the predictive power of the signature by receiver operating characteristic curve. We calculated a composite responder signature score for each tumor sample. We then varied the threshold of the score
from minimum to maximum (with 0.1 increments) and assigned a “Responder” and “Nonresponder” label to each sample based on whether the
sample's score passed the threshold. By comparing the responder identity
determined by this signature score with the responder identity we previously determined, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the score
at each threshold value and plotted the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve.
Gene function and network analysis. Pathway analysis was performed
using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems).6 Genes that were
elevated in responders compared with nonresponders and that were associated with a canonical pathway in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge
Base were considered for the analysis. The significance of the association
between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in two
ways: (a) a ratio of the number of genes from the data set that map to
the pathway divided by the total number of genes that map to the canonical pathway, and (b) Fisher's exact test was used to calculate a P value
determining the probability that the association between the genes in
the data set and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone. Gene
interaction networks were visualized using the Target Gene Information
Network Analysis and Visualization application developed at Rosetta Inpharmatics (22).

breast tumors, INK4a/ARF −/− ES cells were engineered to carry a
doxycycline inducible oncogene (HER2 V659E) with the reverse
transactivator protein expressed under the control of the MMTV
promoter to ensure selective expression in mammary tissue (Fig. 1A).
These oncogene carrying ES cells were injected into blastocysts from
C57Bl/6 mice to generate chimeric animals that were administered
doxycycline immediately after weaning. Within 2 to 6 months after
exposure to doxycycline, all of the animals developed tumors in
one or more mammary gland. More than 100 such individual primary tumors were excised and reimplanted s.c. into several immunocompromised hosts to enable the generation of an archive of
cryopreserved tumor lines for studying variation in phenotype
(Fig. 1B). These secondary tumors were harvested, and cell suspensions were prepared from the tumors from each line, which
were pooled before cryopreservation. All tumor lines were similarly propagated and cryopreserved to yield an archive of 107 tumors
with sufficient material for multiple studies. All subsequent studies began with cells from the second propagation.

Two individual tumors from each tumor line, isolated freshly after the third propagation, were harvested, and their RNA was subjected to microarray analysis (Fig. 2A). A good concordance of
microarray signatures was observed between biological replicates
of a given tumor line (data not shown). Unsupervised clustering
analysis of all tumors revealed the presence of three major clades,
indicating significant heterogeneity at the gene expression level between the different tumors in the BH archive. Analysis of the
in vivo growth of each of the 107 tumor lines on third propagation
showed significant variation in latency (measureable tumors appeared between 1 and 12 days after implantation of 10,000 tumor
cells) and growth rate (tumors reached 400 mm3 between 7 and 32
days postimplantation; Fig. 2B).
Histopathologic analysis revealed tumors from different primary
tumor lines showed different morphologic features including level
of stromal cell involvement, luminal or basal features, and level of
cytokeratin staining (Fig. 2C). In addition, heterogeneity in Notch
pathway activation was assessed by analyzing the expression of the

Notch ligand Jag1 and expression of the downstream Notch transcriptional targets Hes1 and Dtx2 (Fig. 2D). The expression of all
three genes was markedly variable, with Hes1 expression varying
6.3-fold across the population. These data indicate that the 107
BH tumors from the archive display significant heterogeneity at
multiple levels, although the tumors all originated from inducible
Her2 expression. Such a tumor model with large sample size and
intertumor heterogeneity is ideally suited for large-scale efficacy
studies to discover biomarkers predictive of response.
Effects of once weekly doses of MRK-003 on growth of tumor
BH450. In an effort to determine the dosing concentration
and regimen for this model, 10 BH tumor lines were selected at
random and were treated with 200 mg/kg MRK-003 thrice per
week for a 2-week duration. Significant body weight loss was observed using thrice weekly dosing regimen. Meanwhile, concurrent
in vivo studies revealed that a once weekly dosing regimen was well
tolerated, efficacious, and resulted in downregulation of HES1 protein levels (23). We therefore tested various once weekly oral doses
of MRK-003 (75, 150, 300, and 450 mpk) in BH450, a GSI-sensitive
tumor from our initial study. Once-a-week dosing of MRK-003 was
well tolerated and animals continued to gain weight even after
three cycles of dosing (data not shown). At the end of the third
dosing cycle, terminal blood samples were collected by cardiac
puncture at 4, 24, and 72 hours for pharmacokinetic measurements. Maximal drug concentration in plasma was observed
4 hours after dose administration, and the drug concentration fell
to trough levels at 72 hours postdose (Fig. 3A). There was no significant difference in drug exposure between 300 and 450 mpk
dose levels. Tumor volume measurements indicated that weekly
MRK-003 dosing was efficacious in this tumor line and showed a
dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth progression (Fig. 3B).
To examine the effects of MRK-003 treatment on individual tumor cells, tumor sections obtained at the study end point were
stained for the proliferation marker Ki67 (Fig. 3C), for the apoptosis marker terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL), and for the Notch pathway activation
marker Hes1 (Fig. 3C). Quantitative analysis of these sections revealed a significant reduction of Ki67+ cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 3D) in
MRK-003–treated tumors compared with vehicle. A similar level of
inhibition was observed for Hes1, but TUNEL staining revealed no
significant difference between drug treatment and controls (data
not shown). Together, these results show that MRK-003 inhibited
Notch signaling and reduced tumor cell proliferation but had no
clear effect on inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Next, 99 additional
tumor lines were subjected to drug treatment to analyze any variation in response to MRK-003 across the archive of independent
BH tumors. We chose to use 300 mpk once weekly dosing for 2
weeks as the preferred dosing regimen for analysis of the sensitivity of each tumor to MRK-003.
Variation of responsiveness to MRK-003 in the BH archive.
As shown in Fig. 4, with the once weekly dosing regimen, there was
considerable variation in response to MRK-003 with % treated versus control (T/C) values ranging from <40% among the most responsive tumors to 100% among the most resistant when
measured by tumor weight. Both tumor weight and volume were
measured because some tumors with apparently large volumes
were observed to have significant areas with acellular cysts following drug treatment that confounded the analysis of tumor growth
inhibition. Analysis of MRK-003 levels in plasma 6 hours after the
final dose for all tumors indicated that drug exposure was comparable in all animals and there was no correlation between blood

levels and responsiveness measured either by weight or volume
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
To identify gene expression patterns predictive of response, we
first attempted to classify tumors into binary responder and nonresponder groups using the two end points independently. However, there were no signatures that could be identified that were
differentially expressed between the responder and nonresponder
groups in a statistically significantly manner. In addition, we did
not find signatures that showed significant correlation with the
weight and volume measurements independently when these end
points were treated as continuous variables (data not shown).
Next, we explored responder/nonresponder classification using
the statistical significance of the weight or volume difference between
the MRK-003–treated and vehicle-treated groups. We used the t test P
value for difference between mean tumor volume or weight in MRK003–treated study arms relative to vehicle-treated study arms for each
tumor. When we classified responder and nonresponder using the
P value for both volume and weight as a threshold, we discovered
signatures that were significantly above the noise level. To find the
optimal thresholds to declare responders and nonresponders, we

performed a leave-one-out cross-validation to scan for the combination of P value thresholds for volume and weight change that lead to
the maximal prediction power (see details in Materials and Methods).
We found the following criteria to be optimal: responder, mean tumor
volume is <0.05 and mean tumor weight is <0.1; nonresponder, mean
tumor volume is >0.1 and mean tumor weight is >0.01.
GSI sensitivity signature. When characterizing the global pattern of gene expression across the data set, a subset of 19 tumors
clearly showed a distinct gene expression profile, with thousands
of genes being differentially expressed between this subset and the
remaining tumors. The designation of “group 1” was given to this
subset (Fig. 2A, brackets). We noted that all group 1 tumors had the
nonresponder phenotype. Because the large scale differences between group 1 and non–group 1 tumors are the main source of
variability across the data set, the fact that all group 1 tumors
are within one phenotype category (nonresponder) is confounding.
Since non–group 1 tumors contain a significant number of both
responders and nonresponders, we excluded group 1 from subse-

quent attempts to identify responder signatures. Using the thresholds described above to partition tumors into responder and
nonresponder groups, we performed an ANOVA calculation to determine the number of genes differentially expressed between responder and nonresponder along a range of significance levels. As
shown in Fig. 5A, we tested the robustness of the calculation by
performing a permutation test to assess the number of genes that
would be identified in randomly permuted data (randomly assigning responder/nonresponder labels to tumors in each permutation). Using our responder/nonresponder criteria, the number of
genes identified was ∼10 times that expected by chance.
Requiring P < 0.01 and mean fold difference of 1.3 in gene expression between responder and nonresponder groups resulted in a signature that was large enough to capture potentially relevant biology
while maintaining an acceptable false discovery rate. Through this
procedure, we obtained a set of 768 genes that represents the “GSI
sensitivity signature” in this model (genes listed in Supplementary
Table S1; Fig. 5B). Using this set of genes, we produced a composite

score for each tumor (the average of genes upregulated in responders relative to nonresponders minus the average of genes downregulated in responders relative to nonresponders). We then evaluated
the predictive power of this gene signature using ROC analysis. The
ROC curve of the prediction is shown in Fig. 5C. The sensitivity and
specificity of the prediction reaches 70% and 62%, respectively.
We next asked if the GSI sensitivity signature can classify the
group 1 tumors as nonresponders. As shown in Fig. 5D, when we
ranked all the tumors according to the composite score, we found
that all group 1 tumors were classified as nonresponder. These results suggest that our GSI sensitivity signature captured the subset
of overall differences between group 1 and other tumors that are
responsible for their resistance to GSI treatment.
Gene function analysis. To gain insights into the signaling
pathways involved in GSI sensitivity, we performed pathway anal-

ysis to uncover relationships among genes associated with GSI response. We used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis6 software tool to
identify canonical signaling pathways statistically enriched in the
GSI sensitivity signature. As shown in Fig. 6A, eight canonical signaling pathways were identified as being significantly enriched
among genes that were upregulated in responders relative to nonresponders. These include interleukin (IL)-10 signaling and chemokine signaling among others. Interestingly, the Notch canonical
signaling pathway was significantly enriched in the responder
signature. Specific genes in the Notch pathway include deltex
homologue 2 (Dtx2, a transcriptional target of Notch signaling),
Furin (a component of the γ-secretase complex), Notch4, and Rbpj
(mammalian homologue of suppressor of hairless). Increased activation of each of these genes is predicted to result in increased
Notch signaling activity. No canonical signaling pathways were

identified as being significantly enriched among genes that were
upregulated in nonresponders relative to responders.
We also interrogated biological function by assessing the interconnectedness of genes using the Target Gene Information Network Analysis and Visualization application developed at Rosetta
Inpharmatics to identify networks formed on the basis of known
interactions among genes (22). Among genes upregulated in responders compared with nonresponders, an interaction network
of 69 genes was identified (Fig. 6B), suggesting that these genes
participate in similar biological processes. Gene ontology biological process annotations involving inflammation and immune
system processes were most significantly enriched within this interaction network. The most highly interconnected gene was chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). Three canonical members of
the Notch signaling pathway were also identified in this network:
Furin, Notch4, and Rbpj. No interaction networks were identified
among genes that were upregulated in nonresponders compared
with responders.
Previous reports have indicated that loss of function of the
Notch pathway inhibitor NUMB results in increased activity of
Notch pathway signaling (24). Fig. 6C shows that the GSI sensitivity
signature is significantly anticorrelated with Numb mRNA expression across the tumor set, consistent with a loss of Numb activity
being associated with increased dependence on Notch signaling
and increased GSI sensitivity. Taken together, these data indicate
that a de novo analysis of gene expression patterns associated with
GSI response uncovered a significant upregulation of Notch signaling components in the baseline profiles of responders compared
with nonresponders. In addition, other pathways involved in immune-related signaling, which likely also contribute to the determination of GSI sensitivity in this model, have been identified.

Discussion
Here, we describe the use of a genetically engineered mouse
model of breast cancer to perform the largest reported study for
de novo identification of molecular predictors of response to Notch
pathway inhibition. This model is based on the generation of a
large set of independent but genetically similar murine breast tumors that can be used to relate variation in tumor phenotypes, including drug responsiveness, with patterns of gene expression.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that treatment of these tumors with GSI resulted in downregulation of Hes1 expression and
inhibition of proliferation markers. This is consistent with the predominant tumor inhibitory activity of MRK-003 being through its
reported GSI activity and at least in part through its inhibition of
the Notch signaling pathway. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that inhibition of processing of other γ-secretase substrates
by MRK-003 might contribute to tumor growth inhibition.

Although all primary mouse tumors from this model originate
from the same genetic background, we observed significant heterogeneity across tumors at many levels. Such heterogeneity likely reflects additional genetic changes acquired by each tumor during
the initial establishment of the tumor, and/or during propagation
of each primary tumor to form allografts. As such, although the initial
oncogenic event is common across this tumor set, significant heterogeneity is manifest by the time of drug treatment and response determination. We used this heterogeneity to identify a baseline gene
expression signature that is predictive of responsiveness to MRK-003.
Pathway analysis of the GSI response signature identified significant enrichment of multiple canonical signaling pathways among
genes upregulated in responders, including IL-10, chemokine, and
Notch pathway signaling. Pretreatment Notch pathway enrichment
in responders is consistent with GSI acting via Notch pathway inhibition, and indicative of a greater dependence on the Notch pathway in tumors that are GSI sensitive. The identification of other
pathways indicates that GSI effects are complex, and further studies are needed to explore the relationship of IL and chemokine signaling with GSI response in more detail.
Future studies will likely involve the assessment and validation
of this GSI response signature in other preclinical model systems
and relating baseline signature levels to GSI efficacy in clinical
studies. Because the data presented here are derived from a
Her2-driven tumor model, this GSI responder signature may be
most applicable to Her2-positive human breast tumors. However,
given the large amount of heterogeneity observed across the BH
tumor population, it could be possible that the GSI responder signature would be relevant for other breast tumor populations.
In summary, we used an in vivo breast cancer model that enabled the large-scale de novo identification of molecular predictors
of response to γ-secretase inhibition. As the tumors in the BH archive have already been characterized on the molecular level and
archived for storage, treatment of this cohort with other drugs
would enable a similar analysis to that reported here. As such, in
addition to providing a responder hypothesis for GSI, the BH tumor cohort represents a novel resource for preclinical responder
ID in breast cancer.
