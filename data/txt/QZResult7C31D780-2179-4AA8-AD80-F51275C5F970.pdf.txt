ABSTRACT
Late stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually has a low survival rate because
it has high potential of metastases and there is no effective cure. 3′3-Diindolylmethane
(DIM) is the major product of the acid-catalyzed oligomerization of indole-3-carbinol
present in cruciferous vegetables. DIM has been proved to exhibit anticancer
properties. In this study, we explored the effects and molecular mechanisms of antimetastasis of DIM on HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. We chose two HCC cell lines
SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H that have high potential of invasion. The results showed
that DIM inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of these two cell lines
in vitro. In addition, in vivo study demonstrated that DIM significantly decreased the
volumes of SMMC-7721 orthotopic liver tumor and suppressed lung metastasis in nude
mice. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is found over activated in HCC cells. We found
that DIM decreased the level of phospho-FAK (Tyr397) both in vitro and in vivo. DIM
inhibition of phospho-FAK (Tyr397) led to down-regulation of MMP2/9 and decreased
potential of metastasis. DIM also repressed the migration and invasion induced by
vitronectin through inactivation of FAK pathway and down-regulation of MMP2/9
in vitro. We also found that pTEN plays a role in down-regulation of FAK by DIM. These
results demonstrated that DIM blocks HCC cell metastasis by suppressing tumor cell
migration and invasion. The anti-metastasis effect of DIM could be explained to be its
down-regulated expression and activation of MMP2/9 partly induced by up-regulation
of pTEN and inhibition of phospho-FAK (Tyr397).

actin cytoskeleton to coordinate cell motility and
cell invasion [2]. Interaction between integrins and
extracellular matrix(ECM) lead to the activation of FAK
through phosphorylation and autophosphorylation at the
tyrosine 397(Tyr397). The activation of FAK is the key
regulatory point for several signaling pathways. Activated
FAK interacts with PI3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt
(PI3K/AKT) axis to interrupt apoptotic pathways and
increase tumor cell migration [3–5]. Activated FAK
regulates survival and metastasis signaling pathways
through PI3K/AKT pathway and downstream signaling
including MMPs and IAPs activation in HCC [6, 7]. Both
FAK and phosphorylated FAK Tyr397 have been shown
to be overexpressed in HCC samples and HCC cell lines.
In addition, increased FAK and phospho-FAK (Tyr397)

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is one of the most
common and aggressive human malignancies around the
world, especially in developing countries [1]. Although
great progress was attained in cancer treatment, most HCC
patients die from cancer invasion or distant metastasis to
other organs. Therefore, preventing metastasis of cancer
cells is one of the effective strategies for the successful
management of HCC.
The mechanism of cancer invasion and metastasis
is a complicated multistep process involving multiple
genetic alterations. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), a
125 kD non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, is the key
signaling nexus connecting integrins and the dynamic

expression were correlated with tumor stage, vascular
invasion and intrahepatic metastasis in HCC [2]. These
data suggest that deregulation of FAK plays an important
role in HCC malignant progression. Many ways for
inhibition of FAK including siRNA and small molecule
inhibitors has been shown to decrease cellular migration
and invasion in multiple tumor types, including HCC
[8–10]. Therefore, inactivation of FAK pathway could be
a good way to inhibit metastasis of human HCC.
A number of studies demonstrate that diets
rich in fruits and vegetables could reduce the risk of
cancers through some kinds of promising anti-cancer
phytochemicals in them [11]. One of the potential
phytochemicals is 3′3-Diindolylmethane (DIM).
DIM is the predominant active product of the acidcatalyzed oligomerization of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a
phytochemical from vegetables of the family cruciferous
[12]. DIM has been reported to reduce carcinogen-induced
breast and lung tumor formation in rodent models [13, 14].
The growth of bladder and breast cancer xenografts were
also shown to be inhibited by DIM administration [15].
It has also been showed that DIM blocks the metastasis
of many types of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo,
including breast cancer [16], prostate cancer [17, 18],
lung cancer [16] and bladder cancer [19]. However, the
mechanism underlying the role of DIM on HCC treatment
still remains elusive. We initiated this study to investigate
the anti-cancer properties of DIM and elucidate the
underlying mechanisms.
In this study, we investigated the role of DIM in the
anti-metastasis effect on HCC cell lines SMMC-7721 and
MHCC-97H. These cells have high potential of invasion. We
found that DIM dose-dependently inhibited proliferation,
migration, adhesion and invasion of SMMC-7721 and
MHCC-97H in vitro. Oral administration of DIM inhibited
lung metastasis of SMMC-7721 xenograft in BALB/c nude
mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DIM increased the
expression of pTEN and inhibited the phosphorylation of
FAK Tyr397, in succession led to the down-regulation of
MMP2/9.

un-treated cells. The inhibition has statistical significance
(all P < 0.01). With increasing the dose and time of
treatment, the effect of inhibition increased accordingly.
These results suggested that DIM could efficiently inhibit
the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This
result was consistent with previous works of us and
others.

FAK and MMP2/9 up-regulated in SMMC-7721
and MHCC-97H cells
To investigate the ability of migration and invasion
of HCC cells, we used transwell assay and found that
SMMC-7721 and MNCC-97H cells invaded through the
transwell membrane coated with Matrigel more efficient
than other cell lines as shown in Fig 2A. Previous studies
show that FAK is overexpressed in HCC cell lines, and
the level of FAK expression correlated with cell migration
and invasion [2]. We explored the expression of FAK and
phosphorylated FAK (Tyr397) in these cell lines and
found that SMMC-7721 and MNCC-97H cells have
higher levels of FAK and phosphorylated FAK (Tyr397)
compared with other cell lines with lower potential of
invasion (Fig 2B). This result was consistent with previous
report [2]. Because MMP2/9 play important roles in tumor
invasion and metastasis [20, 21], FAK contributes to the
invasion and metastasis of HCC partly through regulating
expression and activation of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 [2].
We tested the expression of MMP2/9 in these cell lines
and found that there were higher expressions of MMP2/9
in SMMC-7721 and MNCC-97H cells compared with that
in other cell lines (Fig 2B). Therefore, SMMC-7721 and
MHCC-97H cells were chosen to be our target cells in the
following steps to study the inhibitory effects of DIM on
the metastasis of HCC cells.

DIM inhibited the adhesion, migration and
invasion of SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H cells
Tumor metastasis is a dynamic hallmark of cancer
which consists of three essential events; migration of
cancer cells from a primary foci to secondary organs,
adhesion of cancer cells at the secondary site and invasion
of extracellular matrix (ECM) of secondary organ [22, 23].
We used wound healing assay to investigate the migration
ability of SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H cells. As shown
in Fig 3A, we found that treatment of 30, 40 and 50 μM
DIM for 72 h reduced the ability of SMMC-7721 cells to
migrate from one end of wound to the other. This result
was further confirmed by transwell assay. We found that
DIM significantly reduced the number of SMMC-7721
and MHCC-97H cells migrating through the transwell
membrane to the lower chamber in a concentrationdependent manner, in which DIM at the concentration
of 15 μM decreased migrating SMMC-7721 cell number
to 52% and MHCC-97H cell numbers to 67% of the

RESULTS
DIM significantly inhibited the proliferation of
HCC cells
The inhibitory effect of DIM on HCC cells
was tested on HCC cell lines including SMMC-7721,
MHCC-97H, QGY-7701, Bel-7402 and HepG2 cells. As
shown in Fig 1, treatment with increasing concentration of
DIM at 40, 50 and 60 μM for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h obviously
inhibited the proliferation of these cells in a time- and
dose-dependent manner. Specifically, after treatment of
DIM at 40 μM for 24 h the survival rate of SMMC-7721
cells was 71%, MHCC-97H cells 75%, QGY-7701 cells
78%, Bel-7402 cells 82%, and HepG2 83% of control

were treated without or with increasing concentration of DIM (30, 40 and 60 μM for 24, 48 and 72 h). After treatment, WST-1 was added
and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Light absorbance was recorded at 450nM. Inhibition of DIM on cell proliferation was calculated based on

of statistical significance and could also be seen at the
concentration of 10 μM in both cell lines. These results
demonstrated that DIM could inhibit the migration of
HCC cells.
The inhibitory effect of DIM on cell adhesion was
also investigated on these two cell lines. The results
were shown as Fig 3C. We found that DIM significantly
decreased the number of cells adhered to cell culture
dishes in a concentration-dependent manner. At the
concentration of 50 μM, DIM decreased the adhered cell
number of SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H to 35% and 22%
of control respectively (P < 0.01).
The inhibitory effect of DIM on invasion was
investigated by examining the ability of SMMC7721 and MHCC-97H cells cross through a simulated
extracellular matrix. As shown in Fig 3D, treatment of
DIM at concentrations from 10 μM to 20 μM inhibited

the invasion ability of SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H at a
concentration-dependent manner. When cells were treated
with DIM at 10 μM, only 77% and 50% of SMMC-7721
and MHCC-97H could invade through the simulated
extracellular matrix and migrate to the insert part. In the
presence of 20 μM DIM, SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H
could hardly transverse and migrate into the lower part
of insert. Taken together, these results indicated that DIM
acted directly on SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H to inhibit
the processes of proliferation, migration and invasion.

MMP-2 and MMP-9

MMP2/9. The FAK specific inhibitor PF-562271 inhibits
the phosphorylation of FAK tyrosine 397 (Tyr397). We
tested the inhibitory effect of PF-562271 and found
that PF-562271, at the concentration of 2.0, 4.0 and

expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were
analyzed by Western blotting and zymography. As
showed in Fig 5B, PF-562271 decreased the expression
and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in a concentrationdependent manner in both cell lines. We also investigated
the effect of PF-562271 on migration capability of HCC
cells with transwell tests. As shown in Fig 5C, we found
that PF-562271 significantly reduced the number of
SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H cells migrating to the lower
chamber in a concentration-dependent manner.
The effect of PF-562271 on invasion, was shown
in Fig 5D, PF-562271 significantly decreased the number
of cells invading the lower surface of inserts compared
with the control group in a concentration manner. The
inhibition rate of invasion was 30%, 45%, 60% of control
at 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 μM PF-562271 in SMMC-7721 and 45%,
55%, 85% of control in MHCC-97H (Fig 5D). These
results illustrated that PF-562271, the specific inhibitor
of FAK phosphorylation could decrease the invasive and
migratory ability of tumor cells through inhibiting FAK
pathway mediated MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and
activity.

As shown in Fig 6A, 48 h after siRNA transfection, the
level of phosphorylated FAK was decreased to 15% in
SMMC-7721 and 21% in MHCC-97H compared with
that in control. In addition, the expression of total FAK
was also decreased. In order to find out if si-h-FAK could
decrease MMP2/9 expression and inhibit cell invasion,
the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were
analyzed by Western blotting and zymography 48 h after
transfection. As showed in Fig 6B, si-h-FAK decreased the
expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in both cell
lines. The effect of si-h-FAK on cell invasion was shown
in Fig 6C, si-h-FAK significantly decreased the number of
cells invading the lower surface of inserts compared with
the control group in a concentration dependent manner.
The inhibition rate of invasion was 30% of control
in SMMC-7721 and 45% of control in MHCC-97H
(Fig 5C). These results illustrated that si-h-FAK, similar
with PF-562271, could decrease the invasive ability of
tumor cells through inhibiting FAK mediated MMP-2 and
MMP-9 expression and activity.

VTN, we used purified human VTN to activate FAK and
induce cells invasion.
In the present study, SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H
were treated with DIM (10, 15 and 20 μM) in VTN-coated
or BSA-coated plate. After 48 h of treatment, cells were
harvested and lysates were analyzed for FAK, phosphoFAK, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Cell conditioned medium
were collected for the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in

VTN coated plates had higher level of phosphorylated
FAK compared with that of control, with no obvious
change on total FAK. The level of phosphorylated FAK
decreased in both cell lines with treatment of DIM. The
expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and activation of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 induced by VTN was also suppressed
by the treatment of DIM (Fig 7B).
To examine whether DIM could suppress the
invasion of cells induced by VTN, we performed invasion

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

assays using transwell assay. VTN markedly increased
invasion of SMMC-7721 (10 verse 230; P < 0.01) and
MHCC-97H (15 verse 160; P < 0.01), however, DIM
significantly decreased the numbers of cell invading
through Matrigel-coated filters in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig 7C). These results suggest that
DIM could significantly inhibit cell invasion induced by
VTN through inactivation of integrin/FAK pathways.

DIM inhibited the activity of FAK by increasing
pTEN expression
PTEN, a lipid phosphatase, is known as an antioncogene which could directly inhibit FAK related
pathways through directly dephosphorylation of FAK [25].

confirm that DIM could inhibit the phosphorylation of
FAK through regulating the expression of pTEN, siRNA
for human pTEN (si-h-pTEN) was used. As shown in

level of phosphorylation of FAK inhibited by 60 μM DIM.
These results revealed that pTEN might play a role in downregulation of FAK by DIM.

mice from control group decreased more quickly than
treatment group because of cancer cachexia(Fig 9A).
As shown in Fig 9C, the average volume of tumor in
nude mice treated by DIM were markedly smaller than
the control group (P < 0.01). Histological analysis
demonstrated that intrahepatic tumor nodules were found
larger in control mice than that in mice treated by DIM.
To further investigate the effect of DIM on SMMC7721 metastasis in vivo, their lung were collected after
sacrificed and the number of nodules on the surface
was counted. The mean number of metastatic nodule
on the surface of the lung was significantly decreased
in mice treated by DIM, compared with control, (2.8 in
DIM treated verse 15.2 in control, P < 0.01) (Fig 9B).
Pathological analysis demonstrated larger and greater

expression of phosphorylated FAK and MMP2/9 in DIMtreated mice were significantly decreased compared with
that in control mice, and the pTEN expression was also
increased by DIM (Fig 9D). Taken together, our results
from both in vitro and in vivo assays illustrated that DIM
can inhibit the formation and metastasis of hepatocellular
carcinoma through FAK signaling pathway.

DISCUSSION
HCC is a common malignancy in many countries
[26]. The low survival rate of late stage HCC is largely
due to its high rate of intrahepatic and extra-hepatic
metastasis [27]. DIM, the predominant active product of
phytochemical indole-3-carbinol (I3C) from vegetables

SMMC-7721 cells were injected into the liver of BALB/c nude mice to establish orthotopic liver cancer model. Nude mice were separated
randomly into two groups, one group were treated with 10 mg/kg of DIM and the other were treated with control vehicle. After 6 weeks,
nude mice were sacrificed. A. Line graph showing control and treated nude mice body weight (g) over a six weeks period. B. Lung
metastasis was observed in the lungs of mice. Only a few metastases were found in mice treated with DIM. The number of lung metastatic
nodules on the surface was counted; representative hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining confirmed the development of tumor in lung tissue.
High-power magnification images (400X) of the same field were showed in blow. C. The development of in situ tumors were observer in

of the family cruciferous [12], inhibits tumor formation
in the early phase of tumor genesis, induces cancer
cells apoptosis and suppresses cancer cells metastasis or
invasion in multiple types of cancer [13–18]. So far, little
is known about the tumor inhibitory effect of DIM on
HCC. In the current research, we used two HCC cell lines
SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H that have high potential
of malignant invasion to investigate the anti-tumor effect
of DIM. We found that DIM inhibited the proliferation,
migration and invasion of these two cell lines. We further
demonstrated the role of DIM in suppressing tumor
metastasis through a mouse liver cancer model.
FAK plays a central role in many types of cell events
including proliferation, survival, apoptosis, migration
and invasion [28, 29]. FAK has been shown to be very
important in the development of liver tumors. Chen et al.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

found FAK and phospho-FAK Tyr397 were overexpressed
in HCC samples and HCC cell lines. The elevated FAK and
phospho-FAK Tyr397 were correlated with tumor stage
and vascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma [2].
In vitro and in vivo tests show that up-regulating FAK
promotes tumor metastasis [30–32]. In our study, we
detected FAK and phospho-FAK Tyr397 in several
HCC cell lines, and also found that FAK and phosphoFAK Tyr397 were overexpressed in SMMC-7721 and
MHCC-97H cells that have higher invasive potential
compared with other cell lines. Previously, some
researchers found that inhibition of FAK phosphorylation
by siRNA or FAK specific inhibitors could suppress HCC
cell adhesion, migration and invasion [2, 33–35]. We
investigated whether DIM inhibited HCC cell metastasis
through down-regulation of FAK. When SMMC-7721
23786

Oncotarget

and MHCC-97H were treated with different concentration
of DIM, we found a significantly decreased level of
phosphorylated FAK Tyr397. In order to confirm the
results of FAK inhibition, we used a FAK specific
inhibitor PF-56227. PF-56227interacts with FAK in the
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket and blocks
the catalytic activity of FAK [36]. When phospho-FAK
Tyr397 were inhibited by PF-56227 in SMMC-7721 and
MHCC-97H cells, the metastatic ability of these two cell
lines decreased. Similar conclusions were obtained after
suing si-h-FAK to confirm the results observed through
using PF-56227. We suggested that DIM might inhibit the
migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells
through FAK signaling pathway.
Activation and phosphorylation of FAK by ECMintegrins is an important phenomena for tumor cells to
achieve migratory phenotype [29]. Vitronectin (VTN),
a multifunctional glycoprotein present in blood and in
the ECM, involves in the cell attachment, spreading
and metastasis [24]. FAK is localized in focal contacts
that becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently
activated on integrin-mediated cell adhesion to several
matrix proteins, including VTN [37]. The highly invasive
human cancer cells expressing integrin receptor αvβ3
binds to VTN and generates a migratory phenotype
through the activation of FAK signaling [38]. In our
study, purified human VTN was used to investigate the
relationship of VTN and the anti-metastasis effect of DIM.
The results illustrated that VTN increased the expression
of phospho-FAK Tyr397 in SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H
cells and promoted invasions of these two cell lines in
transwell tests. When DIM was added, the high level of
phospho-FAK Tyr397 induced by VTN decreased and
invasive potential of two cell lines weaken as well. The
results further confirmed that DIM inhibited the migration
and invasion of these two cell lines through FAK pathway.
The invasive nature of malignant tumors has been
associated with the ability of tumors to degrade extracellular
matrix [39]. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), a family
of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, could degrade almost
all ECM components and involved in the tumor metastatic
cascade [20, 39]. MMP2/9 are the main components of
MMPs and closely associated with migration and invasion
in HCC [7, 40]. In our study, we found that MMP2/9 are
overexpressed in SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H cells
compared to other cell lines. This might be related to the high
potential of invasion [21]. When we treated SMMC-7721
and MHCC-97H cells with DIM, we found that DIM could
decrease the expression level and activity of MMP2/9 in these
two HCC cell lines. These results were consistent with other
reports which confirmed that DIM could inhibit the migration
of cancer cells through down-regulating MMPs, including
those in thyroid cancer [41], breast cancer [42] and prostate
cancer [17, 43]. Accumulated evidence suggested that FAK
play an important role in the regulation of MMP2/9, overactivation of FAK could induce MMP2/9 expression and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

promote cells invasion [44, 45]. Down-regulation of FAK
could inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion partly through
down-regulating expressions and activations of both MMP-2
and MMP-9 [2]. In our research, PF-56227, the inhibitor of
FAK, decreased the expression and activation of MMP2/9
through the inhibition of FAK phosphorylation in SMMC7721 and MHCC-97H cells. In the test of cell invasion
induced by VTN, the expression and activation of MMP2/9
increased and this effect might be induced by the activation
of FAK. When DIM was added, the level of phosphorylated
FAK Tyr397 and the expression and activation of MMP2/9
were suppressed. We suggested that DIM might suppress the
expression and activation of MMP2/9 through inactivation
of FAK and lead to the anti-metastasis. The results of our
in vivo orthotopic liver cancer model demonstrated that DIM
inhibited liver cancer growth and decreased its metastasis to
lung. DIM also inhibited the level of phosphorylated FAK
Tyr397 and decreased the expression of MMP2/9 in liver
tumor tissues.
How did DIM regulate the phosphorylation of FAK?
PTEN, known as an anti-oncogene, could directly inhibit
FAK related pathways through directly de-phosphorylation
of FAK [25]. Recently, Sarkar et al. found that DIM could
up-regulate pTEN expression through down-regulating
the expression of miR-221 and lead to the inhibition of
cell proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells
[46]. In our study, we observed that DIM increased the
expression of pTEN in both hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines, and si-h-pTEN could inhibit the effects of DIM on
FAK phosphorylation. In in vivo tests, the expression of
pTEN increased by addition of DIM. We speculated that
pTEN might play a role in DIM regulation of FAK.
In summary, our data demonstrated that DIM
could inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of
hepatocellular carcinoma cells both in vivo and in vitro.
These inhibitory effects are through increasing pTEN
expression and inhibiting FAK phosphorylation leading
to decreased MMP2/9 expression and activation. Since
long-term exposure to DIM produced no observable
toxicity and DIM is a less efficacious inducer of CYPs
[47], DIM could be a promising anti-cancer drug in the
future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cultures
HCC cell lines (HepG2, QGY-7701, Bel-7402,
SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H) were obtained from
the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China) and cultured in Gibco® RPMI Media
1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum(FBS), penicillin
(100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). All cells

were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to confluent.
A scratch wound in confluent monolayer was made using
a pipette tip. After washing away all detached cells with
PBS, the remaining cells were treated with DMSO or DIM
in fresh complete medium. Photographs were taken at 48 h
and 72 h after treatment.

Reagents and antibodies
DIM was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, MO) and dissolved in DMSO to make a
100 mmol/L stock solution and stored at −20°C  in
multiple aliquots. PF-562271(N-methyl-N-{3-[({2-[(2oxo-2, 3-dihydro-1H-indol-5-yl)amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)
pyrimidin-4-yl}amino)
methyl]pyridin-2-yl}methane
sulfonamide), was obtained from Selleckchem (Houston,
TX) and dissolved in DMSO to make a 10 μmol/L stock
solution and stored at -20°C. Vitronectin was obtained from
Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY) and dissolved
in phosphate buffered saline with calcium and magnesium
(0.90 mM CaCl2, 0.49 mM MgCl2, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM
KH2PO4, 137.93 mM NaCl, 8.06 mM Na2HPO4) to make
a 0.5 ug/ml stock solution. Antibodies against Phospo-FAK
(Tyr397), FAK, MMP-2, MMP-9, pTEN, β-actin were
purchased from Cell Signaling.

In vitro cell migration and invasion assay
In order to test the ability of cells migration, 6.5mm
Transwell® with 8.0 μm Pore Polyester Membrane Insert
(Product #3464, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) was used.
In order to test the invasion ability of cells crossing
through matrigel-coated filter, 6.5  mm Transwell® with
8.0 μm Pore Polycarbonate Membrane Insert coated
with Cultrex® Basement Membrane Extract (BME)
(Product#3432-001-01, Trevigen Inc.) were used. The
procedure was performed as described previously [49].
Cells were starved for 18 h using no-serum medium
and then 1 × 105 cells per well were seeded in insert
with 200  μl  no-serum medium with or without DIM,
and 800 μl of growth medium containing 5% FBS was
added in bottom wells. Following a culture of 16 h, nonmigrating cells were removed from the upper surface by
wiping with a cotton swab. The membrane was fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells
were stained with Giemsa for 25 min, and their numbers in
5 fields of each membrane were counted under an inverted
microscope. The procedure of PF-562271 was the same as
that of DIM, the no-serum medium containing different
concentration of PF-562271 was loaded in inserts. For the
co-treatment of vitronectin and DIM, the same procedures
were used except that the bottom wells were loaded with
no-serum medium containing 5 ng/ml vitronectin or
5 ng/ml BSA.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was assessed by WST-1 Cell
Proliferation and Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (C0035,
Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). In brief,
HepG2, Bel-7402, QGY-7701, SMMC-7721 and MHCC97H were seeded in 96-well plates at 2.5 × 103 cells/well
and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Then cells were treated
with increasing concentration of DIM (30 μM, 40 μM
and 60 μM) in 1640 complete medium for 24 h, 48 h and
72 h. After treatment, WST-1 was added to each well
and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Absorbance was recorded
at 450 nM. Inhibition of DIM on cell proliferation was
calculated based on the absorbance ration between
treatment and control.

Western blotting analysis
Whole cell lysate preparation and Western blotting
analysis were performed as previously described [50].
Briefly, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 320 ×g for
10 min and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM sodium orthovanadate,
1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF, 10 mg/mL
leupeptin, and 1 mM PMSF). Aliquots (20 mg) of the
lysates were separated on a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel and transferred into a PVDF membrane (Millipore,
USA). Blots were blocked for 2 h in blocking buffer
(5% non-fat dry milk in PBST buffer (10 mM
phosphate buffer, 2.7 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl and
0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4)) and incubated with primary
antibodies (1:1000) overnight at 4°C. After washing
with PBST, the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (1:5000) was added to the preparation. The
blot was incubated at 37°C for 1 h and developed using
an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China).

Cell adhesion assay
SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H cells were treated
with DIM at 30, 40 and 50 μM for 48 h. After that,
Cells (5 × 105 cells/well) treated by DIM were plated
in 6-well culture dishes and allowed to adhere for
2.5 h. After that, medium with non-adhered cells was
discarded and wells were gently washed twice with PBS
to remove any loosely attached cells. Adhered cells
were stained with 0.4% trypan blue solution (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) and counted. Adhered cells
were counted and data expressed as percent decrease in
adhered cell count for cells treated with DIM relative to
control cells.

Wound healing assay
Cell migration was analyzed by a wound healing
assay [48]. In brief, SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H cells

In vivo lung metastasis experiments

The activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was detected
through gel zymography as described before [51].
Briefly, SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H cells were seeded
at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 6-well culture
dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. Then they
were switched to serum free medium and incubated
with different concentration of DIM, PF-562271 or left
untreated for 48 h. Conditioned medium were harvested
and centrifuged to remove any debris. According to the
cell numbers in each well, the total protein concentration
of the medium was adjusted to be equal. 10% SDS-PAGE
containing 0.1% gelatin was used and the conditioned
medium was resolved in non-reducing conditions. After
electrophoresis, gels were incubated in re-naturation
buffer (2.5% Triton X-100) for 1 h on an orbital shaker
and switched to developing buffer (50 mMTris-HCl pH
8, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3) for 1 h followed by 24 h at
37°C with new developing buffer. Gels were then stained
with Comassie blue (G-250) and destained with 30%
methanol and 10% acetic acid.

HCC mouse model was created using SMMC-7721
cells. Briefly, SMMC-7721 cells at logarithmic growth
phase were collected, washed three times with PBS and
adjusted the cell number to 1 × 108 cells/ml. BALB/c
nude mice were anesthetized with isofluorane, put in the
supine position, and limbs were fixed with rubber band
in the thermostatic experimental board. After disinfection
with 2% tincture of iodine and 75% alcohol, the skin and
peritoneum were opened, left lobe of the liver was extruded
out of abdominal cavity. Using a micro-syringe, 5 μl of cell
suspension was injected into the left lobe of the liver. After
injection, the pinhole was pressed immediately with sterile
swab to stop bleeding. Then, the left lobe of liver was put
back into the abdominal cavity and the abdominal wall
was closed. A week later, nude mice with injection of HCC
cells were separated randomly into two groups, one group
received 1 mg/ml DIM (10 mg/kg.d) which was suspended
in drinking water with an emulsifier, 0.5% of ethoxylated
castor oil (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The other group received
water with 0.5% of ethoxylated castor oil as a vehicle
control. Mice received a freshly made solution of DIM in
their drinking water every 2 days. After 6 weeks, mice were
sacrificed, tumors were removed and weighted. One part of
tumors were frozen in liquid nitrogen for future analysis, the
left, livers and lungs were collected and fixed in formalin,
embedded into paraffin. Consecutive sections were made
for every block of lung and liver tissue and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. The number of lung metastases was
counted and evaluated independently by two pathologists.

VTN coating and treatment
Because
serum
contains
several
kinds
of ECM proteins, including VTN, therefore,
experiments about VTN were performed under
serum-free conditions. Serum-free medium was
supplemented
with
ITS
(insulin,
transferrin,
selenium; Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD).
For treatment with the combination of VTN and DIM, the
6-well cell culture plates were coated with 5 μg/ml VTN
(PHE0011, Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY))
and control dishes were blocked with 0.1% BSA overnight
at 4°C in PBS and then washed with PBS. SMMC-7721
and MHCC-97H cells at 2.5 × 103 cells/well were allowed
to adhere for 24 h. Then cells were treated with increasing
concentration of DIM (30  μM,  40  μM and 50 μM) in
1640 serum-free medium for 48 h. After treatment, cells
were collected for Western blot analysis, the conditioned
medium were collected for gel zymography.

Statistical analysis
The data were presented as the means plus/minors
standard deviation. SPSS 11.0 software was used for
statistical analysis. The data for time and dosage effects
were analyzed using two-way ANOVA. When appropriate,
data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). The priori significance level was set at P < 0.05.
