BACKGROUND: The use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (PET) scan has increased considerably in the clinical management of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, and its role as a prognostic factor during
chemotherapy has been established recently. METHODS: Between May 2003 and May 2009, 91 newly diagnosed
patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were
treated with 12 weekly cycles of rituximab-MACOP-B (n ¼ 12 patients with PMLBCL), 6 cycles of rituximab-CHOP21
(n ¼ 65 patients with DLBCL, aged < 60 years and 1 patient with PMLBCL), or 8 weekly cycles of rituximab-VNCOPB (n ¼ 13 DLBCL patients, aged  60 years). All patients underwent a staging PET examination at baseline and a midtreatment (interim) PET examination after 6 weeks of rituximab-MACOP-B treatment, 3 cycles of rituximab-CHOP21
treatment, or 4 weeks of rituximab-VNCOP-B treatment and again at the end of the chemo-immunotherapy regimen.
RESULTS: At midtreatment evaluation, 35 patients showed a persistently positive PET scan; only 6 (17%) of these
patients achieved a continuous complete response (CCR). However, 56 patients presented with a negative interim
PET, and 50 (89%) of these patients achieved and maintained a CCR. Comparison between the 2 PET groups indicated a statistically significant association between PET findings and event-free survival (P ¼ .0001) and overall survival (P ¼ .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that midtreatment PET may represent
a significant step forward in helping physicians make crucial decisions on further treatment. Cancer 2011;117:1010–18.

During the last decade, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) has proved to be a
powerful tool in the management of lymphoma, both in patients with Hodgkin disease and patients with non-Hodgkin
(NHL) lymphomas.1-4 In particular, several studies that have evaluated the role of PET as a prognostic tool during chemotherapy have reported its ability to predict outcomes in aggressive NHL.5-11 In force of the pivotal role played by PET in
staging, restaging, and response evaluation, the International Workshop Criteria for malignant lymphoma12 have been revised to incorporate the PET data in NHL outcome assessment, but only at the end of therapy.
Several studies have shown that with the addition of rituximab, event-free survival in an aggressive NHL setting
improves by 10%-20%, and this finding could translate into a parallel improvement in overall survival.13 However, 30%40% of patients cannot be cured with rituximab-CHOP, and the current salvage treatment appears inadequate in the
majority of these patients. A possible strategy for improving patient outcomes in a poor-prognosis setting is to intensify
the first-line treatment, perhaps by using high-dose therapy with the rescue of peripheral blood stem cells. High-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation has been efficient in curing nearly half of all patients who have
resistant or relapsed aggressive NHL. However, trials in which up-front high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell

transplantation were applied after an initial course of
induction therapy have not yielded solid results.14 Some
studies, in particular, have shown little or no benefit from
up-front dose intensification.15-18
Risk-adapted therapy may be performed after
patient stratification according to International Prognostic Index (IPI) score19 or, as demonstrated recently, by
applying a standardized and widely acknowledged molecular or immunohistochemical profiling, particularly in a
high-grade lymphoma setting.20-23 Although the IPI score
represents the most reliable prognostic index in aggressive
lymphomas, patients belonging to the same IPI prognostic group may show significantly different outcomes, primarily because diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
tends to behave heterogeneously. In this sense, the development of gene expression profiling and tissue microarray
techniques have provided wider knowledge of the heterogeneity of aggressive NHL, thus allowing further subdivision of DLBCL patients into 3 prognostic groups
according to cell origin but independent of IPI score: germinal center, activated B-cell, and not classified.
Another strategy might be the selection of poor
prognosis patients according to their response to induction treatment (ie, response-adapted therapy). Recent
reports of PET evaluation have demonstrated a greater
degree of accuracy in early response assessment compared
with computed tomography.5-11 However, the benefit of
midtreatment (or interim) PET evaluation in aggressive
NHL is still a matter of debate,24 and a meta-analysis conducted by Terasawa et al3 indicated that interim PET has
unproven reliability in routine clinical practice.
We report a retrospective monocentric study in
which newly diagnosed aggressive NHL patients were
treated with chemo-immunotherapy, provided they
underwent PET examination before treatment, at midtreatment, and upon treatment completion. The purpose
of the study was to determine the prognostic value of early
PET by evaluating visual data on a semiquantitative basis
in 91 patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between May 2003 and May 2009, 91 untreated patients
with de novo aggressive NHL completed chemo-immunotherapy treatment in our institution. Patients were considered for this retrospective study if they had a
histologically confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL or primary
mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) in accordance with World Health Organization classification25 and

had stage 2-4 disease as outlined by the Ann Arbor
Conference.26
Staging evaluation included the collection of each
patient’s full history, a physical examination, a complete
hematological and biochemical survey, a chest x-ray
(particularly for those patients with mediastinal bulk at
presentation), and a computed tomography examination
of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without
contrast enhancement. A full-body 18F-FDG PET examination was mandatory at baseline. Unilateral bone
marrow aspiration and biopsy were also performed in all
patients.
Patient Characteristics
All 91 patients screened for this study fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The patient demographics are outlined in
Table 1. Forty-eight male patients and 43 female patients
were enrolled, with a median age of 54 years (range, 1790 years). Seventy-eight patients presented with DLBCL
(either the germinal center or activated B cell variety), and
13 patients had a diagnosis of PMLBCL. Bulky disease

was present in 30 (33%) patients, mostly at mediastinal
sites.
Treatment Protocol
In accordance to our institutional therapeutic guidelines,
12 PMLBCL patients were treated with the MACOP-B
protocol,27 a 12-week regimen of doxorubicine, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, bleomycin, methotrexate, and
prednisone on alternating blocks and on a weekly basis,
with the inclusion of rituximab (4 infusions out of
12 cycles). The 65 DLBCL patients aged <60 years and
1 patient with PMLBCL were treated with rituximabCHOP21 for 6 cycles, whereas the 13 DLBCL patients
aged 60 years received rituximab-VNCOP-B (rituximab, etoposide, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin) in an 8-week
MACOP-B-like regimen.28,29
PET Examination
Midtreatment evaluation was performed via PET examination after 6 out of 12 cycles in patients receiving rituximab-MACOP-B, after 4 out of 8 cycles in patients
receiving rituximab-VNCOP-B, and after 3 cycles in
patients receiving rituximab-CHOP21. PET examination
was performed immediately before the subsequent
treatment cycle to reduce the potential occurrence of
false-positive results due to postchemotherapy reactive
inflammatory tissue responses.
Restaging PET examination, along with a full-body
comparative computed tomography examination, was
repeated at least 1 month after the scheduled chemoimmunotherapy treatment was completed.
18
F-FDG PET (GE Discovery) examination was
performed according to standard procedures. PET acquisition was performed in 6-hour fasted patients after intravenous injection of 5.3 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG, with an
uptake time of 60-90 minutes. PET images were evaluated on the basis of visual inspection by 3 experienced
readers: in all cases, agreement among readers was
obtained for the final report. The examination was considered negative when no pathological tracer uptake was
shown. Areas of focal uptake were interpreted as unequivocally positive for lymphoma when they were localized to
sites of previous disease (in this sense representing a residual disease or a disease relapse), within asymmetrical
lymph nodes, or within lymph nodes unlikely to be
affected by inflammation (mediastinal, except for hilar,
and abdominal). Sites of known physiological uptake
(including laterocervical brown adipose tissue, kidneys,

1012

ureter, bladder, and musculoskeletal areas) that showed
symmetrical uptake were not described in the report,
and the scan was considered negative. Homogeneously
increased uptake within the gastrointestinal tract in
patients without mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
lymphoma was also considered nonpathological and
therefore not reported. Other sites of increased uptake
were described and attributed to a definite or possible
cause. When 18F-FDG uptake was attributed to a nonpathological cause, the report was regarded as negative
for lymphoma and other diseases; when the uptake was
considered unrelated to lymphoma, the report was judged
as suspicious for other diseases. On the basis of these
criteria, PET scans were scored as negative or positive.30
Response
Responses were classified according to the International
Workshop Criteria.31,32 Overall survival and event-free
survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier
method.33 Event-free survival was defined as the interval
from the date of enrollment to the first evidence of progression, disease relapse, death from any cause, treatment
discontinuation due to any adverse event, or patient
withdrawal. Follow-up was performed every 6 months; all
patients were followed during the outcome, with a median
follow-up of 50 months (range, 12-68 months).
Patient demographics and characteristics are
summarized using descriptive statistics. Comparisons
were performed using a Wilcoxon test for equality of survivor functions. Statistical analyses were performed with
Stata 11 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX), and
significance was set at P < .05.

RESULTS
Sixty-seven out of 91 (74%) patients achieved a complete
response (CR) at the end of the treatment. Among these
patients, 56 maintained a continuous complete response
(CCR), with a median follow-up of 50 months (range,
12-68 months), and 11 subsequently experienced a
disease relapse. Eleven patients achieved only a partial
response (PR), and 13 patients progressed during the
course of initial therapy.
All patients underwent a midtreatment PET examination during the induction cycle of chemo-immunotherapy; 56 PET scans were considered negative, and the
remaining 36 demonstrated a persistent abnormal uptake.
According to the PET findings, patients were subdivided
into 2 groups: those with a negative interim PET scan and

progressive disease was indicated. Clinical outcomes both
at the end of treatment and during follow-up are depicted
in Figure 1 as a function of early PET status during
induction therapy.
Negative PET at Midtreatment
Fifty (89%) of the 56 patients with a negative interim
PET scan are presently in CCR, with a median follow-up
of 54 months (range, 28-68 months). All patients who are
still maintaining a durable CR could achieve a negative
PET scan only after 50% of the global induction chemoimmunotherapy treatment has been administered.
Four patients (all with a DLBCL) with a negative
midtreatment scan maintained a CR at the end of treatment (as documented by the end-of-treatment PET) but
relapsed after 8, 25, 37, and 44 months, respectively. All
of these patients underwent a following salvage treatment
according to their age and performance status: 2 patients
were considered eligible for high-dose conditioning with
autologous stem cell transplantation, whereas the other 2
patients underwent conventional chemotherapy.
Only 2 of the patients with a negative interim PET
scan did not achieve a CR at the end of front-line treatment, and both showed progression of the disease. One of

these patients obtained a CR after additional therapy and
was disease-free after 22 months.
Positive PET at Midtreatment
Among the 35 interim PET-positive cases, only 6 (17%)
patients maintained a durable CCR after completion of
front-line treatment, with a median follow-up of 18
months (range, 12-49 months). Thirteen patients in this
group achieved a CR, but 7 patients relapsed after 11, 12,
12, 13, 18, 22, and 38 months, respectively. Eleven
patients achieved a PR at the end of front-line treatment
and therefore underwent further therapy. One patient
died of progressive disease, and 3 patients are still alive
with disease; with remaining 7 patients obtained a CR after high-dose therapy for the rescue of autologous stem
cells, and they maintained their response at a median follow-up of 20 months (range, 12-37 months). Eleven
patients experienced disease progression during front-line
treatment, and only 2 of them achieved a late CR after salvage treatment. Examples of positive PET scans at midtreatment evaluation are shown in Figures 2 and 3.
Survival Analysis
The 4-year event-free survival of the 56 interim PET-negative patients was 75% (95% CI, 46.3-90.3) compared

At baseline, several areas of increased uptake in the thorax (mediastinal nodes and ribs), abdominal lymph nodes, and spleen were evident. At midtreatment PET and both ‘‘end-of-treatment’’ and ‘‘follow-up’’ PET, no residual uptake was observed, thus indicating no evidence of disease. The

DISCUSSION
Aggressive lymphomas comprise different histological and
clinical disease subtypes for which front-line treatment is
given with a curative intent. Patients with aggressive NHL
who respond poorly to front-line treatment or relapse
soon afterward generally have a very poor prognosis, even
if they are assigned high-dose salvage regimens. So far, the
prognosis in aggressive NHL is most commonly estabCancer

lished on the basis of the histopathological subtype and on
the clinical characteristics summarized in the IPI,19
although this score shows a considerable variation
between the outcomes of individual patients, even within
the same prognostic group.
PET is a well-recognized diagnostic tool used for
staging and monitoring response to therapy in most
neoplastic diseases, including aggressive NHL.5-11 The

superiority of PET over computed tomography in identifying active disease after therapy completion has recently
led to the revision of response criteria.32 Several studies
have shown that after 1-3 cycles of chemotherapy for
aggressive NHL,3,5-11,34 early metabolic changes as documented by early or interim PET scan may be highly predictive of final treatment response and progression-free
survival. However, the real benefit of interim PET in
aggressive NHL has been questioned recently. Terasawa
et al3 reported a wide variation in the results of their recent
meta-analysis, which is probably related to the lack of uniform and standardized criteria of interpretation.3 In addition, data regarding the reproducibility of interim PET
interpretation have been published by Horning et al,35
who concluded that there is still moderate examination
reproducibility among nuclear medicine experts, thus
indicating the need to standardize PET interpretation
criteria in current clinical practice. A successful attempt
has been documented by Barrington et al36 for Hodgkin
disease, wherein very good agreement was achieved in the
reporting of interim PET scans between expert readers
from 4 different European centers using a 5-point scale.
Other potential complications in interim PET
interpretation include: 1) the real heterogeneous panel
of chemotherapy (CHOP14, CHOP21, ACVBP) and
chemo-immunotherapy (rituximab-CHOP14, rituximab-CHOP21, rituximab-ACVBP) used, even in the
same settings of patients; 2) the role of rituximab, which
may produce a high incidence of false-positive results37;
3) the different time points at which the PET scan is performed during treatment (after 1 or 2 cycles in patients
with Hodgkin disease; after 3 or 4 cycles in patients with
NHL); and 4) the methods used in the assessment of
response—namely, a qualitative (or visual) method and a
quantitative or semiquantitative method, the latter refer-

1016

ring to the standardized uptake value, with recent reports
providing an update on the role of standardized uptake
value-based semiquantitative response assessment in combination (or in comparison) with visual analysis.9,11,38 All
of these variables, which are often taken into consideration in the same report, can modify and alter the results
significantly; consequently, data obtained from interim
PET evaluations performed at different observation
periods should not be pooled. Furthermore, the potential
different response related to the inclusion or exclusion of
rituximab in the treatment regimen must be considered.
We analyzed 91 newly diagnosed aggressive NHL
patients, all of whom had undergone midtreatment PET
examination. Patients were treated with different chemoimmunotherapy regimens, and in all cases the interim
PET examination was performed after completion of the
first half of the treatment. Our data indicate that persistent 18F-FDG uptake at midtreatment is predictive of
event-free and overall survival. Only 6 out of 35 (17%)
patients with a positive midtreatment scan achieved a
CCR; in contrast, almost all patients (50/56, 89%) with a
negative midtreatment scan achieved a CCR. The strong
prognostic impact of a negative midtreatment PET scan
was confirmed over time by a 75% event-free survival rate
and 90% overall survival rate. In addition, our results
indicate and confirm that midtreatment PET evaluation
is a stronger prognostic factor for event-free and overall
survival than IPI score.
Several studies have shown that a negative early
PET is highly predictive of a negative end-of-treatment
PET5-7,39; however, some investigators40-42 have reported
recently that midtreatment PET failed to predict different
outcomes in aggressive NHL patients. These discordant
findings in the setting of aggressive NHL are outlined in
Table 2. It is probable that these data are partially altered

Cancer

Interim PET in High-Grade Lymphoma/Zinzani et al

by the heterogeneous chemotherapy treatments used, the
inclusion or exclusion of rituximab in the treatment regimen, and the timing of PET examination. Therefore, it is
important to note that these data are insufficient to justify
an early treatment change in early positive PET patients
with aggressive NHL.
Kasamon et al43 investigated the role of early treatment intensification with salvage chemotherapy followed
by autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with a
positive midtreatment PET scan. These authors reported
a favorable outcome in a poor-risk population, with 2year event-free survivals of 67% in PET-positive patients
and 89% in PET-negative patients.
The present study appears to be one of the most
homogeneous studies in terms of chemo-immunotherapy
regimens used and timing of midtreatment PET evaluation (ie, PET evaluation performed after the first half of
treatment).
In conclusion, data from several important studies
suggest that interim PET is a useful prognostic tool in
aggressive NHL, particularly in the subset of DLBCL
patients. These findings may constitute an important step
forward in the optimization of patient management in a
front-line approach.
