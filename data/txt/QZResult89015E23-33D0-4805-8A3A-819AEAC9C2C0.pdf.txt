Abstract
Frequent genetic alterations of the components in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway contribute greatly to breast cancer initiation and progression, which makes targeting this signaling pathway a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we showed that in the
presence of copper (Cu), disulfiram (DSF), a clinically used antialcoholism drug, could potently inhibit breast
cancer cell growth regardless of the PIK3CA status. Surprisingly, the treatment with a mixture of DSF and
copper (DSF-Cu) led to the decreased expression of PTEN protein and the activation of AKT in a doseand time-dependent manner in different cell lines with or without PIK3CA mutations. Treatment of breast
cancer cell lines with a combination of DSF-Cu and LY294002, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, resulted in the significant
inhibition of cell growth when compared with either drug alone. In addition, the combined treatment of DSF
and LY294002 significantly inhibited the growth of the breast tumor xenograft in nude mice induced by MDAMB-231 cells expressing mutant PIK3CA-H1047R and PIK3CA-E545K, whereas neither DSF nor LY294002 alone
could significantly retard tumor growth. Finally, the observed in vivo inhibitory effects are found associated
with aberrant signaling alterations and apoptosis-inducing activities in tumor samples. Thus, our finding
shows for the first time that treatment of breast cancer with DSF results in a novel feedback mechanism that
activates AKT signaling. Our study also suggests that the combination of DSF and a PI3K inhibitor may offer a
new combinational treatment model for breast cancer, particularly for those with PIK3CA mutations. Cancer

Introduction
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway has been firmly established for its role in multiple cellular activities, including cell proliferation, survival,
metabolism, cytoskeleton reorganization, and membrane
trafficking (1–3). The abnormal activation of this signaling
pathway leads to various diseases such as diabetes, autoimmunity, and cancer. PIK3CA, the gene encoding the α
form of class IA PI3Ks, is amplified and overexpressed in
an assortment of human cancers, including breast, ovarian,
head and neck, urinary tract, cervical, and thyroid cancers
(4–8). Recently, somatic mutations of PIK3CA were identi-

fied in various human cancers with different frequencies
(9–13). Specifically, 20% to 30% of breast cancers were
found to harbor PIK3CA mutations, making it one of the
most frequent genetic alterations in breast cancer. The
amplification and somatic mutation of PIK3CA ultimately
leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,
thereby making PIK3CA a promising target for breast cancer treatment. Although many groups have focused on designing specific PI3K inhibitors, some studies have shown
that maximum efficacy and minimum side effects may result from combining the PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitor with
other cancer therapeutics that have different mechanisms
of action (14–17).
Accumulated experimental and clinical evidence supports
the notion that the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway plays an essential role in the upregulation of proliferation, downregulation of apoptosis, and promotion of
angiogenesis and development of drug resistance in human
tumor cells (18–20). This implicates proteasome inhibitors
as potentially novel anticancer drugs (21–24). Consistent
with this idea, our group reported that disulfiram (DSF), a
clinically used antialcoholism drug and copper-binding
agent, is capable of binding copper to form a new complex
(DSF-Cu), which inhibits the proteasome and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cell cultures and retards the growth
of breast cancer xenografts (22). Although DSF has recently
been tested in a phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of

DSF Facilitates PI3K Inhibition in Breast Cancer Cells

metastatic melanoma and refractory solid tumors involving
the liver, its exact mechanism of action has not been well
characterized.
In this report, we investigated the effect of DSF-Cu on the
AKT signaling pathway, a well-established survival signaling
pathway in breast cancer. We found that DSF-Cu treatment
on several breast cancer cell lines led to the downregulation
of PTEN protein expression and activation of pAKT along
with the induction of cell death. This observation prompted
us to test the possible synergistic effects of DSF-Cu and the
PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, in these breast cancer cell lines, as
loss of PTEN and activation of AKT may make cells more dependent on the PI3K/AKT pathway, and consequently more
sensitive to PI3K Inhibition. Indeed, our in vitro study
showed that the combination of DSF-Cu and LY294002 suppressed the growth of various breast cancer cells more effectively than either treatment alone. In addition, the effect was
more significant in breast cancer cells with PIK3CA mutations than in breast cancer cells with wild-type-PIK3CA.
When given to mice with a human breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-231 expressing mutant PIK3CA, the combined
treatment of DSF and LY294002 showed more significant tumor growth inhibition than either single treatment. Moreover, the in vivo inhibitory effects were found associated
with signaling alterations, proteasome inhibition, and apoptosis activation, as shown by the accumulation of p27 and
BAX proteins, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage,
and apoptotic nuclei formation detected by multiple assays
using tumor samples. Taken together, the information from
this study provides a basis for developing a promising therapeutic model in which a PI3K inhibitor and a proteasome
inhibitor may be combined to effectively treat breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and protease inhibitor experiment. Human
breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, BT20,
MCF7, T47D, and BT474 were obtained from the American
Tissue Culture Collection and grown at 37°C in humidified
5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231 are cells that
express wild-type PIK3CA, whereas the MCF7 cell line contains a PIK3CA-E545K mutation. The T47D cell line contains
a PIK3CA-H1047R mutation and the BT20 cell line contains
two PIK3CA mutations (H1047R and P539R). All MDA-MB157 and MDA-MB-231–derived cells were cultured with the
same medium. The MCF10A and MCF10A-derived cell lines
were cultured in serum free medium with insulin, hydrocortisone and epidermal growth factor as described in ref. 25.
Caspase-3 inhibitor III was purchased from Calbiochem.
Protease inhibitors N-acetyl-L-Leucyl-L-methioninal, transepoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidin) butane (E64),
N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysinechloromethyl ketone, and
N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) were
obtained from Sigma. All these reagents were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and were used
to pretreat cells for 4 hours, followed by treatment with

www.aacrjournals.org

DSF-Cu for 6 hours. Protein lysates were then collected for
the Western blot.
Construction of recombinant lentivirus and establishment
of stable cells expressing mutant PIK3CA. The method was
done as described (25).
Western blotting. For immunoblotting, we used the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibodies
against pAKT (Ser473), AKT, phosphorylated extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (pERK), ERK, p-p70s6K, p70s6K,
ubiquitin, PARP (Cell Signaling), p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and BAX (Sigma-Aldrich); and mouse monoclonal
antibodies against V5 (Invitrogen), and β-actin (SigmaAldrich). A Western blot process was carried out as described (25).
Cell proliferation assay. Combinational treatment was
performed by incubating cells with LY294002 for 2 days, adding DSF-Cu, and incubation for 1 additional day. After treatment, an MTT assay was performed as described in the
protocol (Promega).
Human breast tumor xenograft experiments. Five-weekold female athymic nude mice were purchased from Taconic
Research Animal Services and housed under pathogen-free
conditions. Xenograft experiments were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and guidelines set forth by
the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee
of Wayne State University. MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-H1047R
and MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K cells (3 × 106) were injected
s.c. into one flank of each mouse. Tumor size was measured
with calipers every other day. Tumor volume (V) was determined by the equation V = (L × W2) × 0.5, in which L is the
length and W is the width of the tumor. When xenografts
reached volumes of ∼200 mm3, the mice showing tumors
were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 7), a DSF
only group (n = 6), a PIK3CA inhibitor LY294002 only group
(n = 6), and a combination group (DSF+LY294002; n = 6).
These groups received the following treatments thrice weekly
by s.c. injection on a different flank of the cell injection: solvent control (PBS/cremophor/DMSO/ethanol, 7.5:1.5:0.5:0.5),
DSF (30 mg/kg), LY294002 (70 mg/kb), or DSF (30 mg/kg)
plus LY294002 (70 mg/kb), respectively. The experiment
was terminated and the mice were sacrificed when the control tumors reached ∼1,000 mm3 (on day 29). The tumors
were removed and photographed, and then used for multiple
assays including Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
H&E staining, IHC, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. For
H&E staining, paraffin-embedded sample slides were deparaffinized, hydrated, and then stained with hematoxylin for
1 minute. After rinsing, the slides were stained with eosin
for 1 minute, rinsed, and sealed with coverslips using Permount. For immunohistochemical staining, mouse monoclonal anti-p27 antibody (1:40; Vector Laboratory) and rabbit
polyclonal anti-BAX antibody (1:50; Zymed Labs, Inc.) were
used. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using
the ApopTag Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis Detection kit
(Chemicon).

at a single concentration level and LY294002 on tumor burden in vivo was carried out using a balanced 2 × 2 factorial
design with six replicates in each category. The drug effect of
DSF + 10 μmol/L LY294002 is compared between mutated
and wild-type cell lines using t test. All tests apply a significance level of 0.05 without adjustment for multiple tests. All
the above-specified analyses were performed in the statistical
software R.

Results
The effect of DSF-Cu on breast epithelial cells with or
without PIK3CA mutation. In an effort to investigate
whether DSF-Cu has different effects on breast cancer cell
lines with different PIK3CA status, we treated BT20 cells
(with P539R and H1047R mutations) and MDA-MB-231
cells (with wt-PIK3CA) with various doses of DSF-Cu under
various time courses. There was no observable difference

in the dose- or time-dependent effects of DSF-Cu treatment on proliferation in these two cell lines. In addition,
DSF-Cu treatment induced significant accumulation of
ubquitinated proteins and PARP cleavage in both breast
cancer cell lines (Fig. 1). Interestingly, treatment with the
authentic proteasome inhibitor MG132, which was used as
a control, generated a p85 PARP cleavage fragment in both
cell lines, whereas DSF-Cu treatment resulted in a p85 fragment in MDA-MB-231 cells and a p65 fragment in BT20
cells (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data suggests that inhibition of cell proliferation induced by DSF-Cu is a common phenomenon in breast cancer cell lines regardless of
PIK3CA status.
DSF-Cu treatment results in PTEN protein decrease and
AKT activation. We next investigated the effect of DSF-Cu
on the AKT signaling pathway, which plays a critical role
in cell survival and proliferation. We first treated MDA-MB231 cells with a mixture containing copper and either DSF,
clioquinol (CQ), or tetrathiomolybdate (TM). CQ is a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease and has antiproteasomal, androgen receptor–suppressive, proapoptotic, and
antitumorigenic activities in human breast and prostate cancer cells in the presence of copper (26, 27). TM is a strong

copper chelator currently being tested in clinical trials
(28, 29) and was used as a control here. To our surprise,
we found that treatment with 10 or 20 μmol/L DSF-Cu or
20 μmol/L CQ-Cu mixtures could significantly inhibit PTEN
protein expression, whereas TM-Cu at both concentrations
had no effect (Fig. 2A).
A kinetic experiment using MDA-MB-231 cells showed a
time-dependent decrease in PTEN protein expression with
DSF-Cu treatment, which correlated with an initial increase in
pAKT levels that decreased at later time points. The total AKT
signal was not changed in this treatment (Fig. 2B). To confirm
that this phenomenon was not cell line specific, we treated BT20
cells that harbor PIK3CA mutations with 10 μmol/L DSF-Cu and
showed a significant time-dependent decrease in PTEN protein
expression in these cells as well. Again, p-AKT was abruptly
increased with DSF-Cu treatment (0.5–2 h) and then decreased to normal levels (after 2 h; Fig. 2C). A similar
phenomenon was also observed with a low level of DSF-Cu
treatment (0.5 μmol/L DSF) in BT20 cells, although the decrease of PTEN protein expression was postponed until after
24 hours of treatment and pAKT activation did not last longer
than 24 hours (Fig. 2D).
We next sought to explore the mechanism underlying the
decrease in expression of PTEN upon the treatment of DSF-Cu.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed no significant
change in PTEN mRNA level after DSF-Cu treatment in
BT20 cells (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that protein stability
rather than transcriptional regulation is the major mechanism responsible for the decreased PTEN protein levels in
response to DSF-Cu treatment. We then examined the effects
of different protease inhibitors on the decreased expression
of PTEN protein induced by DSF-Cu in cultured cells. As
shown in Fig. 3B, decreased PTEN expression induced by
DSF-Cu treatment was attenuated in BT20 cells pretreated
with two cysteine protease inhibitors NEM and TPCK.

However, when MDA-MB-231 cells were tested, three protease inhibitors, E64, NEM, and PMSF, showed effect in
blocking PTEN degradation induced by DSF-Cu (Fig. 3C).
In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3D, a caspase-3 inhibitor could
not rescue the PTEN degradation in BT20 cells treated with
DSF-Cu. Therefore, caspase-3 does not play a critical role in
PTEN degradation in DSF-Cu–treated cells.
To investigate whether other authentic proteasome inhibitors could also cause a decrease in PTEN protein expression, we used MG132 and PS341, two well-recognized
proteasome inhibitors, on breast cancer cell lines with different dose and time courses. The result showed that both
MG132 and PS341 treatments led to the activation of pAKT
and apparent decrease of PTEN protein in BT20 cells. The
effects were less apparent in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Data S1). These data suggest that AKT activation
and PTEN protein decrease may be common to all the proteasome inhibitors.
Combined treatment of LY294002 and DSF-Cu inhibits
cell growth in vitro. AKT is a major cell survival molecule
and activation of pAKT is a common cellular response to
proapoptotic signaling. PTEN antagonizes PI3K and negatively regulates the AKT signaling pathway (30–32). Suppression
of PTEN expression in breast cancer cells leads to AKT activation and confers sensitivity to inhibitors of mammalian
target of rapamycin and AKT (33). In addition, breast cancer
cell lines with PIK3CA mutation are more sensitive to PI3K
inhibitor than cells with wt-PIK3CA, as evidenced by several
reports including our own using newly established cell lines
(Supplementary Data S2–4).
Considering that DSF-Cu treatment leads to multiple biological effects such as decreasing PTEN and activating AKT,
along with its cell death induction function, we investigated
whether the combined treatment of DSF-Cu with LY294002
would show an additive or a synergistic effect in killing breast

cancer cells and also whether this effect would become more
significant in cells with PIK3CA mutation. First, we performed
in vitro cell proliferation assays on BT20, MCF7, T47D, and
MDA-MB-231, four cell lines with different PIK3CA mutation
statuses. The combination of DSF-Cu and LY294002 treatment
led to a more significant decrease in cell proliferation than
each single treatment alone in all four cell lines (Fig. 4A). Specifically, the effect in BT20 cells was more significant than in
MDA-MB-231 cells at three concentrations (P = 0.007, 0.001,
and <0.001). MCF7 and T47D cells had very similar effect in
response to the combinational treatment (Supplementary
Data S5). Statistical analysis indicated that synergism of the
two drug treatments was found in all four cell lines

(Supplementary Data S5; Fig. 4B). In addition, we performed
a similar treatment on a set of isogenic cell models: MDAMB-231/vector cells, MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-H1047R, and
MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K (Fig. 4C). We found that combined treatment led to increased proliferation inhibition
compared with each single treatment alone in all three cell
lines. The effect was more significant in MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-H1047R and MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K cells than in
MDA-MB-231/vector cells with 10 μmol/L LY294002 plus

(Fig. 4D). Moreover, the effect of MDA-MB-231/PIK3CAH1047R and MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K cells responding

to the combinational treatment is similar (Fig. 4C). We also
observed similar results in MDA-MB-157 and MCF10Aderived model cells (Supplementary Data S6).
Combined treatment of LY294002 and DSF synergistically
inhibits tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells in vivo. To
further test our hypothesis in vivo, four different treatments
were delivered to a xenograft mouse model created by s.c.
injection with MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA H1047R cells. We found
that combined treatment, as well as treatment with DSF or
LY294002 alone, inhibited tumor growth by 74.5% (P = 0.02),
35% (P = 0.18), and 27% (P = 0.21), respectively, compared
with the solvent control (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, tumor burden
in the DSF and LY294002 single-treatment groups was reduced by 25% (P = 0.3) and 16.7% (P = 0.4), respectively,
whereas in the combined treatment group, tumor burden
was reduced by 58.3% (P = 0.02), compared with the control
group (Fig. 5B). Two-way ANOVA test was performed and
showed synergism of the two drugs DSF and LY294002 on
tumor burden in vivo (P = 0.002; Supplementary Data S7).
Similarly, in contrast to either single treatment, only the
combined treatment could significantly retard the growth
of the xenograft tumor induced by the MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K cells (Supplementary Data S8). Taken together,
the in vivo data are consistent with in vitro data and support
the hypothesis that the combined treatment of DSF and
LY294002 has a more significant effect in targeting breast
cancer cells. In addition, the mutation in the helical and

kinase domain had no significant difference in response to
the combined treatment.
To further investigate whether the observed inhibitory effects of the combined treatments and single treatments are
associated with signaling alterations or apoptosis induction,
tumor samples from xenograft mice were subjected to
Western blotting and IHC assays. Western blots using the tumor extracts showed that DSF treatment slightly increased
pAKT, whereas LY294002 treatment decreased pAKT and
the combined treatment led to a relatively low-level of pAKT
compared with control. No significant changes in p70S6K or
p-p70 S6K were observed (Fig. 5C). In addition, combined
treatment led to significant PARP cleavage compared with
single treatment alone or control. Subtle accumulation of
ubiquitinated protein was also observed in DSF-, LY294002-,
and combination-treated tumors (Fig. 5D). An increase in the
levels of the proteasome-targeting proteins p27 and BAX were
also observed in the combination-treated sample (Fig. 5D)
and confirmed by IHC (Fig. 6A), indicating proteasomal
inhibition in these tumor samples. Moreover, apoptosis in tissues derived from xenografts that received the combined
treatment occurred about thrice more frequently than in tissues derived from xenografts treated with DSF or LY294002
alone as shown by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 6A; positive control
was shown in Supplementary Data S9). Apoptosis induction
in tumor samples was further observed by the H&E staining
results. In contrast, apoptosis occurrence was not apparent in

the control xenograft tumors (Fig. 6A). Overall, the combined
treatment of DSF and LY294002 showed significant inhibition
of breast tumor growth in nude mice, and this inhibition was
associated with aberrant signaling alterations, proteasome inhibition, and induction of apoptosis.

Discussion
Although DSF is clinically used as an antialcoholism drug,
our group, along with several others, reported that DSF could
be used as an anticancer drug (22). One possible mechanism
is that DSF may interact with elevated levels of endogenous
copper in tumor tissues (34–36) and form DSF-Cu complexes
with active antitumor properties, specifically proteasomal
inhibition and apoptotic induction. Consistent with previous
observations, our current study found that DSF treatment induced an accumulation of many ubiquitinated proteins in
different cell lines regardless of the PIK3CA status. We also

4002

showed that a low dose of DSF-Cu could induce the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and activate AKT, although it
did not significantly inhibit tumor growth in vivo. This observation prompted us to speculate that a combination of lowdose DSF with reagents harboring different mechanisms
could result in high therapeutic effects and low toxicity in vivo.
In this study, we showed that DSF-Cu treatment decreased
the expression of PTEN protein (but not RNA) levels in different breast cancer cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent
manner. Therefore, inhibition of protein synthesis and/or increase of protein degradation could be the mechanisms underlying this serendipitous observation. However, because
decreased expression of PTEN protein upon DSF-Cu treatment was observed in the very early hours, we thus focused
on the protein degradation mechanism. Our study showed
that different protease inhibitors could reverse the PTEN
degradation induced by DSF-Cu in two different cell lines
and the cysteine protease inhibitor NEM commonly works
in two different cell lines. This result not only confirmed

DSF Facilitates PI3K Inhibition in Breast Cancer Cells

our hypothesis but also is consistent with several previous
reports that protease expression could be regulated by a
feedback mechanism in response to some proteasome inhibitors (37, 38). Therefore, in our study, the DSF treatment
might lead to the upregulation of some protease activity,
which in turn may lead to the degradation of the PTEN
protein.
In the past several years, numerous studies have identified
a high frequency of PIK3CA somatic mutations in cancer cell
lines and tumor samples, and have clarified the oncogenic
properties of mutant PIK3CA in cancer tumorigenesis (39, 40).
More importantly, 80% of the PIK3CA somatic mutations
were identified in two hotspots, which are separately located
in the helical and kinase domains of the PIK3CA molecule.
Several recent studies suggest that the mutations in the
helical and kinase domains trigger a gain of function through
different mechanisms and speculate the contrasting roles of
p85 and Ras-GTP in these two mutations (41–43). In addition, these two mutations were also reported to be associated
with different prognoses for disease-free survival (44). However, the results of several previous studies using different
mutant model cell lines indicated that H1047R and E545K,
two mutations located separately in the kinase and helical
domains, have very similar response to a pan-PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 (13, 25, 45). The in vitro and in vivo assay results of
the current study further support this notion, suggesting that
the inhibition of the ATP binding site of PI3Ks is a feasible
strategy in targeting cancer cells with different PIK3CA
mutations.
Due to the structural similarity between the isoforms of
PI3Ks, a specific inhibitor targeting PIK3CA is still unavailable and, as a result, most developed PI3K inhibitors are
pan-PI3K inhibitors. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence has
shown that various other PI3K isoforms (e.g., β, δ, and γ) are
also involved in tumorigenesis (46–49). Therefore, a pan-PI3K
isoform inhibitor may offer enhanced therapeutic benefits
compared with an isoform-specific inhibitor. This notion
has been further supported by a recent report that shows
that although p110α activation is required to sustain the
proliferation of established PIK3CA-mutant tumors, PTENdeficient tumors depend instead on p110β signaling (50).
In this regard, a pan-PI3K inhibitor is expected to have the
broadest clinical application, as it will target the growth of
both PIK3CA mutations and PTEN-null cancers. In our current study, DSF treatment led to decreased PTEN protein
and activation of AKT in both cell types with and without
PIK3CA mutations. Therefore, we expect that the combina-

tion of a pan-PI3K inhibitor with DSF would be more effective than an isoform-specific inhibitor.
Many newly identified drugs tested in research or preclinical settings are common apoptosis inducers and the mechanisms of these drugs on cells are not entirely clarified.
This drawback limits their transition from research to clinical applications. In our current study, we show for the first
time that DSF-Cu treatment on breast cancer cell lines leads
to a decrease in the PTEN protein level and an increase in the
pAKT level. Both changes are believed to ultimately lead to
the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, DSF
seems to have two mechanisms of action. On one hand,
DSF-Cu inhibits the proteasome, which in turn triggers the
death pathway and induces apoptosis. On the other hand,
DSF-Cu also activates the PI3K/PTEN/AKT survival signaling
pathway (Fig. 6B). Consistent with this observation, our
study showed that the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, combined
with DSF treatment, not only effectively inhibited cell proliferation in vitro, but also significantly decreased the tumor
formation in vivo. Taken together, our current observations
reinforce the notion that effective therapy could result from
combinations of therapeutic agents with different functional
mechanisms. More significantly, our results suggest that a
potential proteasome inhibitor and a pan PI3K inhibitor
could be a novel and promising combined treatment option
for breast cancer therapy.
