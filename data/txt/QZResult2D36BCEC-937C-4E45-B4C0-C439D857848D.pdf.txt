ABSTRACT

Plant flavonoid apigenin prevents and inhibits UVB-induced carcinogenesis in the
skin and has strong anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties. Here we identify
mechanisms, by which apigenin controls these oncogenic events. We show that apigenin
acts, at least in part, via endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, thrombospondin-1
(TSP1). TSP1 expression by the epidermal keratinocytes is potently inhibited by UVB.
It inhibits cutaneous angiogenesis and UVB-induced carcinogenesis. We show that
apigenin restores TSP1 in epidermal keratinocytes subjected to UVB and normalizes
proliferation and angiogenesis in UVB-exposed skin. Importantly, reconstituting TSP1
anti-angiogenic function in UVB-irradiated skin with a short bioactive peptide mimetic
representing exclusively its anti-angiogenic domain reproduced the anti-proliferative
and anti-angiogenic effects of apigenin. Cox-2 and HIF-1α are important mediators of
angiogenesis. Both apigenin and TSP1 peptide mimetic attenuated their induction by
UVB. Finally we identified the molecular mechanism, whereby apigenin did not affect
TSP1 mRNA, but increased de novo protein synthesis. Knockdown studies implicated
the RNA-binding protein HuR, which controls mRNA stability and translation. Apigenin
increased HuR cytoplasmic localization and physical association with TSP1 mRNA
causing de novo TSP1 synthesis. HuR cytoplasmic localization was, in turn, dependent
on CHK2 kinase. Together, our data provide a new mechanism, by which apigenin
controls UVB-induced carcinogenesis.

adult tissues and their expression is often decreased in
the course of tumor progression, an event permissive
for tumor angiogenesis [3]. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1)
was the first endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor to
be identified [4] and its loss is among the critical
events in progression of multiple cancers including
carcinomas of the breast and colon as well as skin
cancers [5, 6]. Previous studies identified TSP1 as a
critical angiogenesis inhibitor in human and mouse skin,
whose expression is blocked by ultraviolet B (UVB)
[7, 8]. Ectopic TSP1 delays the growth of xenografted

INTRODUCTION
Unlimited proliferation is one of the hallmarks
of cancer [1, 2]; however, to realize their capacity for
unlimited growth in vivo tumors overcome multiple
constraints posed by normal host tissues. To grow
beyond the threshold size of several mm in diameter,
tumors require autonomous blood supply, which is
generated through neovascularization (angiogenesis),
another hallmark of cancer [2]. Endogenous antiangiogenic proteins are present at high levels in normal

cutaneous tumors in mice and TSP1 transgene mitigates
acute and long-term UVB damage in the skin [9, 10].
Thus TSP1 is an important therapy target in multiple
cancer types, including non-melanoma skin cancers and
melanoma [11, 12]. Here we report that plant flavonoid
apigenin effectively restores TSP1 expression in UVBirradiated skin.
Apigenin, is a potent chemopreventive agent and
inhibitor of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis [13]. We
have shown that apigenin causes G1 and G2/M growth
arrest by targeting cyclins B1 and D1 [14, 15] and by
promoting p53-dependent transcription [16] in epidermal
keratinocytes exposed to UVB. In colon and prostate
cancers, apigenin causes growth arrest and cell death
via DR5 [17, 18] and E-cadherin [19]. Importantly,
apigenin blocks cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 and its target
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [20, 21] via complex regulatory
mechanism, whereby two RNA-binding protein HuR and
translational repressor T-cell specific antigen 1-related
protein inhibit Cox-2 induction by UVB [22].
In addition to its cytotoxic and cytostatic effects,
apigenin inhibits angiogenesis. In non-skin tissues, this
has been attributed to the suppression HIF-1α and VEGF
[23–26]. Other in vitro studies indicate the role of
nitric oxide (NO) and IL6/STAT pathways [27, 28].
Here, we show that apigenin inhibits cutaneous
angiogenesis, at least in part, by maintaining high
levels of anti-angiogenic TSP1. Apigenin mitigated
the TSP1 loss due to UVB exposure in the epidermal
keratinocytes in culture and in mouse skin. Moreover,
it alleviated angiogenic and proliferative responses
to UVB radiation in the skin in vivo. The regulation
of TSP1 by apigenin was post-transcriptional. TSP1
mRNA was strongly decreased in UVB-treated cells and
remained low in the presence of apigenin. In contrast,
apigenin increased translational activity of existing
TSP1 transcripts. Specifically, it increased cytosolic
localization of the RNA-binding protein Human antigen
R (HuR) and HuR association with TSP1 mRNA,
causing enhanced translation and high TSP1 protein
levels.
Thrombospondin-1 is a large multi-functional
protein whose anti-angiogenic activity was mapped
to the Type 1 malarial repeats, with CD36 as one of
the signaling receptors on the vascular endothelium
(reviewed in [29]). Importantly, peptide mimetic of
TSP1, ABT-898, which represents anti-angiogenic
thrombospondin repeats (TSR2) and blocks angiogenesis
in CD36-dependent manner [29], was sufficient to
reproduce the anti-angiogenic and cytostatic effects of
apigenin in the skin suggesting a key functional role of
TSP1 in apigenin’s chemoprevention of UVB-induced
oncogenic events. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of the regulation of an endogenous antiangiogenic factor by apigenin, with dramatic effect on
cutaneous angiogenesis.

Apigenin restores TSP1 expression in UVBtreated skin keratinocytes
Seeking mechanisms underlying apigenin’s effects
in the skin, we assessed TSP1 levels in mouse and human
keratinocytes exposed to UVB and treated with apigenin.
In immortalized 308 mouse keratinocytes (Fig. 1a)
and in primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes
(NHEKs, Fig. 1b), TSP1 expression was dramatically
decreased 12 hr following UVB exposure. Importantly,
both pre-treatment with apigenin (1–2 hrs prior to UVB)
Fig. 1a, b and d) and treatment immediately after UVB
irradiation (Fig. 1c) similarly increased TSP1 protein
levels. In sham-irradiated cells, apigenin caused a
moderate increase of already high TSP1 levels, compared
to a robust increase in UVB-irradiated cells, where TSP1
was barely detectable (Fig. 1d).
Importantly, apigenin restored TSP1 expression in
the UVB-treated skin in vivo. As was shown previously,
TSP1 expression (detected by immunohistochemistry,
IHC) was vanishingly low in the skins of mice after UVB
irradiation. In contrast, in animals treated with topical
apigenin, TSP1 staining in the epidermis was similar to
that of untreated controls (Fig. 1e). Interestingly, one of
the TSP1 anti-angiogenic receptors, CD36, was similarly
downregulated by UVB and restored by apigenin
(Supplementary Fig. 1).

Apigenin and TSP1 peptide mimetic blocks
UVB-induced epidermal thickening
TSP1 active regions have been extensively
analyzed and its anti-angiogenic activity mapped to the
Type 1 malarial repeats (TSR), which yielded series
of highly active TSP1 peptide mimetics. One of them,
ABT-898, derived from TSR2, is especially potent in
multiple models of angiogenesis and tumor growth and
reproduces a full spectrum of TSP1 angioinhibitory
effects [30–32]. We therefore tested its ability to
reproduce apigenin’s effects in the UVB-treated skin.
Epidermal thickening was noted as early as 12 hrs after
UVB exposure (Fig.  2a,  c) and lasted up to 48 hours
(Supplementary Fig. 2). The thickening was largely due
to hyperproliferation, as was evidenced by increased
number of the keratinocyte layers (Fig. 2a, d). Apigenin
significantly decreased both the thickness and the
number of layers in the epidermis of irradiated mice
(Fig. 2a, c, d). Importantly, subcutaneous injections of
ABT-898 had a similar effect and the combination of
apigenin and ABT-898 caused even greater decrease in
epidermal thickness and the number of keratinocyte layers
(Fig. 2c, d). In agreement, UVB caused an approximately
4-fold increase in proliferation, as was measured by IHC
for Ki-67 (Fig. 2b, e). Treatment with either apigenin or

ABT-898 caused a 2-fold reduction in the number of Ki67 positive nuclei per linear 100μm of epidermis. The

effects of each compound alone and this difference was
statistically significant (Fig. 2e).

attributed to the decreased production of VEGF-A, due
to the blockade of hypoxic and growth factor signaling.
However, apigenin’s effect on cutaneous angiogenesis
and TSP1 has not been documented. We therefore
analyzed apigenin’s anti-angiogenic effects in the skin and
tested the ability of TSP1 anti-angiogenic peptide mimetic
to reproduce these actions. UVB significantly increased
microvascular density (MVD) in the dermis, as was
measured using IHC for the endothelial marker, CD31
(Fig. 3a, b), and in the underlying adipose tissue (data
not shown). In contrast, treatment with apigenin and/or
ABT-898 inhibited UVB-induced angiogenesis by at
least 60%, suggesting a critical role for TSP1 in the
anti-angiogenic action of apigenin.
UVB is known to increase expression of
Cox-2 [35, 36], a critical mediator of inflammation

and angiogenesis [37, 38]. We have earlier shown that
apigenin inhibits the induction of Cox-2 by UVB [20, 39].
ABT-898 alone caused a minor increase in CD31 staining
(Fig. 3a, b) and Cox-2 expression (Fig. 3c, d), however
this trend did not reach significance. In contrast, ABT898 significantly reduced UVB-induced angiogenesis
(Fig. 3b, P<0.001) and Cox-2 expression (Fig. 3c, d,
P<0.009).

ABT-898 blocks the stimulation of HIF pathway
by UVB
Apigenin inhibits HIF pathway and VEGF
production in non-skin tissues. We used ABT-898 to
determine whether these effects of apigenin could be
related to TSP1.

(1300 J/m2 daily, 5 consecutive days). Topical Apigenin (5 μMol) and subcutaneous ABT-898 (100 ng/ml in PBS, 30 mg/kg) were given

irradiation (Fig. 5e). Importantly, apigenin increased
cytoplasmic HuR in UV-irradiated mouse skin in vivo
24 hours post irradiation (Fig. 5f).
HuR localization can be controlled by multiple
kinases including Erk1/2, p38, JNK-1 and Chk2 (reviewed
in [43]). All of these are perturbed by apigenin in diverse
cell types [44–46]. To identify the player(s) involved
in apigenin regulation of HuR in the skin, we have
measured TSP1 expression and assessed HuR cytoplasmic
localization in the NHEK cells pre-treated with specific
kinase inhibitors. The ability of apigenin to restore TSP1
expression in the UVB-irradiated keratinocytes was
impaired when JNK-1 and Chk2 were blocked (Fig. 6a).
Chk2 inhibitor caused a marked decrease in HuR
cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 6b) suggesting that Chk2
is a critical mediator of apigenin’s regulation of HuR and
TSP1. In addition, JNK-1 inhibitor markedly altered HuR
staining in the cytoplasm, with striking punctate pattern.
A similar, although less pronounced pattern was observed
in the presence of Chk2 inhibitor (Fig. 6b).
However, JNK-1 blockade, but not Chk2 blockade,
decreased TSP-1 levels regardless of apigenin and/or UVB
exposure. (Supplementary Figure 3).
Together, our results indicate that apigenin
prevents oncogenic UVB action in the skin, including
proliferation and angiogenesis, through activation of
CHK2 and possibly JNK-1, causing HuR translocation to
the cytoplasm, where it binds TSP1 mRNA and increases
its translational activity. In addition, TSP1 inhibits Cox-2
and poses additional restrictions on dermal angiogenesis
and proliferation (Fig. 7).

IHC for HIF-1α showed positive staining in
control skin, predominantly in basal layer, which was not
significantly altered by apigenin or ABT-898 (Fig. 4a). The
expression of HIF-1α (staining intensity) increased 24 hrs
post-irradiation (Fig. 4a, red arrow). This increase was
abolished by apigenin and/or ABT-898 (Fig. 4a).
VEGF is the main pro-angiogenic target of the
HIF pathway. Accordingly VEGF staining of epidermal
keratinocytes was also increased by UVB 24 hrs postirradiation (Fig. 4b, red arrow) and this increase was
abolished by apigenin and by ABT-898, alone or in
combination (Fig. 4b). In sub-epidermal skin layers,
VEGF staining was localized mainly to the intercellular
spaces (Fig. 4b, black arrow), presumably due to its
binding to the extracellular matrix.

Apigenin regulates TSP1 via the RNA-binding
protein HuR
Pre-treatment with apigenin strongly increased
TSP1 levels in the UVB-irradiated skin and epidermal
keratinocytes (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, apigenin failed
to restore TSP1 mRNA levels in UVB-irradiated
keratinocytes (Fig. 5a), suggesting regulation at posttranscriptional level. We therefore investigated its potential
regulatory effect on TSP1 translation. We focused on
ELAV-like 1 human antigen R (HuR) because it is one of
apigenin’s molecular targets [20] and is involved in control
of mRNA stability and translation. HuR can shift the ratio
between translated and untranslated mRNA towards the
active fraction [40] and has been reported to promote de
novo TSP1 synthesis [41]. We used siRNA knockdown to
test the role of HuR role in TSP1 regulation by apigenin.
Indeed, HuR silencing diminished the ability of apigenin
to rescue TSP1 expression in UVB-treated cells (Fig.
5b). Moreover, real time RT-PCR of mRNA from HuR
complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation, showed
increased recruitment of TSP1 mRNA in apigenin-treated
keratinocytes (Fig. 5c). Importantly, metabolic labeling
with [35S]-methionine showed higher de novo TSP1
synthesis in UVB irradiated cells treated with apigenin,
which was abolished in proportion with the extent of HuR
knockdown (Fig. 5d). Analysis of whole cell extracts was
performed to show that equal amount of [35S]methionine/
cysteine was incorporated into the cells and that protein
translation in general was not affected by the different
treatments.

DISCUSSION
Long-term sun exposure is widespread and
significantly increases the risk of epithelial cell cancers;
even a single UVB exposure causes skin alterations
including erythema, epidermal hyperplasia, vascular
dilation and hyperpermeability [47]. Vascular changes
due to UVB are especially prominent in the skin and
have been attributed to the increased pro-angiogenic
cytokines and chemokines, which include VEGF, basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and interleukin-8
(reviewed in [48]). On the other hand, neoangiogenesis
and vascular leakage are tightly controlled by TSP1, an
endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor expressed at high
levels by epidermal keratinocytes. Previous studies
showed that acute vascular reactions to UVB are
more pronounced in the skin of TSP1-null mice [7, 8].
Moreover, mice with TSP1 overexpression targeted
to dermal keratinocytes exhibit weakened vascular
responses to UVB irradiation, including cutaneous
angiogenesis, increased endothelial cell proliferation,
and apoptosis [49]. Furthermore, TSP1 transgene
significantly mitigates the longer-term UVB damage
in the skin, such as photo-damage and wrinkling [49].

Apigenin regulates HuR subcellular localization
In the cell, HuR activity is determined by its
localization. Inactive HuR is sequestered in the nuclei
and cytoplasmic HuR becomes active and controls mRNA
stability and translation [42]. In sham- and UVB-irradiated
308 keratinocytes, apigenin treatment significantly
increased the levels of HuR in the cytoplasm 4 hrs post

These results stress the importance of the cutaneous
vasculature in UVB-induced skin damage. They point to
anti-angiogenesis as a target in preventing chronic photodamage and skin carcinogenesis and suggest TSP1 as a
means for skin cancer prevention and therapy.
Apigenin is a natural chemopreventive agent with
clear anti-angiogenic effects [23, 33]. Studies in cancer cell
lines linked its anti-angiogenic potential to the decreased
HIF-1 or STAT-3 signaling and resultant down-regulation
of pro-angiogenic VEGF [23, 50]. Other studies show that
apigenin decreases production and activity of proteases
including MMP-1, uPA and MMP-2 and thus attenuates
angiogenesis [34]. Our recent findings in prostate cancer
cells and epidermal keratinocytes demonstrate the
inhibition of Cox-2 and PGE2 synthesis by apigenin, which
could potentially hinder angiogenesis [20, 21, 39].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Here, we show for the first time that apigenin inhibits
UVB-induced cutaneous angiogenesis by maintaining
normal high levels of endogenous TSP1. As was shown
previously, UVB irradiation decreases TSP1 protein
and mRNA in cultured mouse and human keratinocytes
and in mouse skin. Importantly, we showed that pretreatment with apigenin restored high TSP1 protein levels
in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in our study apigenin
strongly attenuated neoangiogenesis, proliferation and
epidermal thickening in mice exposed to UVB irradiation.
Furthermore, TSP1 bioactive peptide mimetic, ABT-898,
restored normal angiogenesis and skin thickness and
reduced proliferation in the UVB-irradiated mouse skin,
suggesting that TSP1 induction by apigenin is sufficient
to alleviate the acute UVB damage. Full-length TSP1 is a large molecule with multiple functional domains

Figure 7: Schema of the anti-angiogenic cascade induced by apigenin in the UVB-irradiated skin. UVB exposure increases

proliferation of the epidermal keratinocytes and elevated angiogenesis in sub-epidermal layers. These events are dependent on the increased
production of Cox-2 and reduced levels of mRNA encoding anti-angiogenic TSP1. In the presence of apigenin, HuR enters cytoplasm of the
epidermal keratinocytes where it binds and stabilizes TSP1 mRNA and increases de novo translation. In contrast, Cox-2 mRNA becomes
destabilized. The accumulation of TSP1 protein results in attenuated proliferation and angiogenesis. In addition, TSP1 decreases Cox-2
production via unknown mechanism, and further augments anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic action of apigenin.

(Type-2 repeats, EGF-like domain, and N-terminal region)
whose effects are distinct from these of the anti-angiogenic
TSR represented by ABT-898. Because it reproduces a large
portion of apigenin’s effects in UVB-irradiated skin and
keratinocytes, we conclude that the main effects of TSP1
in this setting are mediated trough its Type I (TSR) repeats.
In contrast with apigenin, TSP1 has no documented
effects on HIF-1α. However, TSP1 peptide ABT-898
was shown to decrease VEGF production in mice
with orthotopic ovarian cancers [51]. Here we show,
the same TSP1 peptide mimetic decreased HIF-1α
levels and inhibited VEGF production in the epidermal
keratinocytes caused by UVB exposure. Moreover, the
same peptide reproduced another important effect of
apigenin in UVB-treated cells, the reduction of Cox-2
expression. Apparently apigenin controls Cox-2 via HuR,
as was shown previously [20], and this pathway involves

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TSP1. Cox-2 is one of the mediators of VEGF-induced
angiogenesis [52]. Thus the inhibition of Cox-2 induction
could be a consequence of VEGF repression by ABT-898.
Interestingly, apigenin had opposing effects on the
two modifiers of angiogenesis, Cox-2 and TSP1. We have
recently discovered that apigenin causes cytoplasmic
localization of the RNA-binding protein HuR in UVBtreated keratinocytes where it binds the AU-rich motif
in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of the Cox-2 mRNA
and engages another RNA-binding protein, TIAR,
causing translational repression [20]. Here, we found
that similar to Cox-2, apigenin increased the binding of
HuR to the TSP1 mRNA. However, unlike Cox-2, HuR
binding increased de novo TSP1 synthesis. This divergent
effect could be due to the differences in the molecular
landscape of the 3ʹUTR of the Cox-2 and TSP1 genes.
Previous studies demonstrate that HuR binding to the

10

Oncotarget

3ʹUTR and stabilization of the target mRNA can lead to
multiple outcomes. In some cases, HuR partners with
translational repressors, such as Smaug1 and thereby
blocks protein synthesis [53]. In others, HuR interferes
with Argonaut (Ago) binding and formation of RISC
complexes containing miRNA, and thus lifts translational
repression [54]. The miRNA response to UVB is not
well understood, however several miRNA have been
implicated [55]. The 3ʹUTR of human and mouse TSP1,
unlike that of Cox-2, contains multiple binding sites for
the UVB-responsive miRNA including miR-141, miR-125
and miR-495, adjacent to the putative HuR binding
site(s) (Supplementary Tables 1a, b and 2a, b). Thus it is
possible that inhibition of RISC underlies the increased
translation of the TSP1 message via apigenin - HuR axis in
the UVB-treated keratinocytes and skin. Our results also
indicate that Chk2 (MAPKAPK2) and possibly JNK-1
are likely mediators of HuR cytoplasmic translocation
due to apigenin exposure. Interestingly, blocking JNK and
Chk2 resulted in characteristic punctate patterns of HuR
staining. Similar patterns were noted previously in HeLa
cells subjected to heat shock and ascribed to stress granule
assembly [56]. Moreover, similar granules were identified
as the site where HuR target mRNAs are degraded [57].
Previous studies identify TSP1 as a p53 target in
some tissues, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells of
the mammary gland [58–60]. However, the mechanisms
that govern TSP1 expression are tissue-specific: distinct
regulatory pathways have been identified in fibroblasts and
epithelial cells [61]. Moreover, p53 regulation of TSP1 may
be indirect, as in colon cancer, where p53 inhibits TSP1
expression through miR-194 [62]. Similar mechanisms may
be at work in cutaneous keratinocytes, where of TSP1 levels
rapidly decline despite stabilization and accumulation of p53
that occurs in response to UVB-induced DNA damage.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate a previously
unknown effect of apigenin in the skin, where it counters
UVB-induced angiogenesis by maintaining normal high
levels of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, TSP1.
This finding has important therapeutic implications.
Apigenin is orally bioavailable and non-toxic [63] and
thus presents a cheap and effective alternative to the
bioactive peptides, which remain the only available
type of TSP1-derived therapy [29]. This is particularly
relevant because of the general importance of TSP1 in
blocking acute and long-term UVB skin damage and
carcinogenesis [7–9, 64–66]. TSP1 inhibits angiogenic
activity by multiple growth factors [67, 68], which is
especially important because in addition to VEGF, UVB
induces multiple pro-angiogenic cytokines including IL-6,
IL-8 and bFGF [48]. Thus maintaining sufficient levels of
endogenous TSP1 is more likely to have profound effect
on angiogenesis than VEGF inhibitors alone.
Our study also yields important mechanistic
insight into context-dependent dichotomy of translational
regulation by the RNA-binding protein HuR in the skin.

We show that cytoplasmic translocation of HuR caused by
apigenin and subsequent binding to the 3’ regions on the
target mRNA can cause either repression or activation of
translation, as is the case for Cox-2 and TSP1, respectively,
the events that culminate in the inhibition of angiogenesis
and proliferation in the UVB-irradiated skin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and reagents
All chemicals were from Sigma–Aldrich Co
(St.  Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified. For detailed
procedures and antibodes, see Supplementary materials
section Supplementary Methods and Supplementary
Table 3. The mouse keratinocyte cell line 308 was derived
from Balb/c mouse skin; primary normal human epidermal
keratinocytes (NHEKs) were isolated at the Skin Disease
Research Center Core (Northwestern University) as
described previously [69]. Specific protein kinase inhibitors
for MEK1 (U0126) in the Erk1/2 pathway and Chk2
(Chk2II) were from Millipore (Billerica, MA) and used at
10 μM working concentration. Inhibitors of p38 (SB203580)
and JNK-1 kinases (SP600125) from InvivoGen (San Diego,
CA) were used at 10 and 50 μM, respectively.

Treatment of cells
The cells were irradiated with FS40T12 lamps
(National Biological, Twinsburg, OH, emission peak 313 nm)
with Kodacel filter (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY)
to eliminate UVC. Apigenin stock (50 mM in dimethyl
sulfoxide, DMSO) was diluted in cell media. ABT-898 (AcGV-DalloIle-SQIRP-ethylamide), an octapeptide derived
from TSP1 active internal peptide GVITRIR [30], was made
to order (CPC Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA), reconstituted in
water to 10 mg/ml and diluted in cell media as desired.

Treatment of mice
We have performed only the procedures approved by
Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee,
in strict adherence to the National Institutes of Health
guidelines. Six to 8-week old female SKH-1 hairless
mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) in groups of five
were treated with sham or UVB radiation (1300 J/m2
daily, 5 days), topical Apigenin (5 μMol) in DMSO/
acetone (1:9 v/v) and subcutaneous ABT-898 (100 ng/ml
in PBS, 30 mg/kg) were given 1–2 h prior to each
radiation. Mice were sacrificed at 12, 24 and 48 h after
final UVB exposure to harvest dorsal skins.

Immunostaining
Immunostaining was performed as described
elsewhere [70]. Stainings for CD31, Ki-67, HIF-1α and
11

Oncotarget

Analysis of Nascent TSP1 Protein

VEGF were performed at Northwestern University Mouse
Histology and Phenotyping Core.

For metabolic labeling, 308 keratinocytes were
pre-incubated 1 h in methionine and cysteine free
DMEM (Sigma). Twelve h post-treatment, the cells were
given a 15 min pulse of with 500 μCi [35S]L-methionine
and [35S]L-cysteine (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and
harvested in lysis buffer as described previously [20].
Immunoprecipitation with anti-TSP1 or control antibody
was carried out overnight at 4°C. Following extensive
washes in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl,
5 mM EDTA and 0.5% NP-40, the immunoprecipitates
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and assessed by
autoradiography.

Immunofluorescence
The cells were grown on chamber slides (Nalgene
Nunc International), fixed in paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocking
1h in 5% goat serum the slides were incubated overnight
with HuR antibody in 5% goat serum at 4°C followed
by fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (2h at
room temperature). The cells were counterstained with
diaminophenylindole (DAPI).

Immunoblotting

Quantitative and statistical analyses

The cells lysates were resolved on SDS PAGE and
protein transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which
were blocked in 5% dry milk in Tris buffered saline with
0.1% Tween 20 and incubated overnight with primary
antibodies at 4°C followed by secondary antibodies
(2 h, room temperature). The membranes were developed
with Enhanced Chemoluminescence reagent (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ) and the signal detected by autoradiography.

1.	 Measurements of epidermal thickness: the
number of cell layers in the epidermis was determined in
H&E-stained slides by counting the number of nucleated
epithelial cells along a vertical line from the stratum basale
to the stratum granulosum, away from hair follicles, in 10
representative fields at 400x magnification. The epidermal
thickness (μm) was similarly measured in the same areas
and included the full thickness from the stratum basale to
the stratum corneum.
2.	 Microvascular density and Ki-67 positive
nuclei were quantified using “Object Count” function
of the ImageJ64 software (National Institutes of Health).
CD31-positive structures (reported as “capillaries
per area”) or Ki-67 positive nuclei in the epidermis,
outside of the hair follicles, were quantified in at least
10 random fields, on three sections from three individual
animals. The numbers of Ki67 positive nuclei was
calculated per 100 linear μm of epidermal layer and
the number of CD31-positive vascular structures per
100 μm2 of epidermal area.
3.	 Statistical significance was calculated by
pairwise comparison, with 2-tailed Student’s T-test,
and by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, Graph
Pad Prism). P values below 0.05 were set as significant.

RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), following manufacturer’s
instructions.

RNA interference
For HuR knockdown, siRNA duplex targeting
mouse HuR and non-silencing control (Santa Cruz,
Santa Cruz, CA) were introduced using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA),
following manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunoprecipitation and analysis of mRNP
complexes
Cytoplasmic extracts collected as described [20] were
incubated 2 h on ice with HuR antibody or control IgG
(15 μg/sample) followed by slow rocking with Protein A/G
Plus agarose beads (30 μL/sample, 1.5 h at 4°C). The beads
were precipitated by centrifugation (2000g, 2 min at 4°C),
and RNA extracted using TRIzol reagent. The RNA was
treated with DNAse I (DNA-free kit, Ambion, Austin, TX)
and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III with random
hexamer primers (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Realtime PCR was performed using TaqMan Gene Express
with TSP1 primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
in ABI Prism 7900HT system, the product normalized to
GAPDH and calculations performed using ΔΔCt method.
