ABSTRACT
The discovery of inhibitors for oncogenic signalling pathways remains a key focus
in modern oncology, based on personalized and targeted therapeutics. Computational
drug repurposing via the analysis of FDA-approved drug network is becoming a very
effective approach to identify therapeutic opportunities in cancer and other human
diseases. Given that gene expression signatures can be associated with specific
oncogenic mutations, we tested whether a “reverse” oncogene-specific signature
might assist in the computational repositioning of inhibitors of oncogenic pathways. As
a proof of principle, we focused on oncogenic PI3K-dependent signalling, a molecular
pathway frequently driving cancer progression as well as raising resistance to
anticancer-targeted therapies. We show that implementation of “reverse” oncogenic
PI3K-dependent transcriptional signatures combined with interrogation of drug
networks identified inhibitors of PI3K-dependent signalling among FDA-approved
compounds. This led to repositioning of Niclosamide (Niclo) and Pyrvinium Pamoate
(PP), two anthelmintic drugs, as inhibitors of oncogenic PI3K-dependent signalling.
Niclo inhibited phosphorylation of P70S6K, while PP inhibited phosphorylation of
AKT and P70S6K, which are downstream targets of PI3K. Anthelmintics inhibited
oncogenic PI3K-dependent gene expression and showed a cytostatic effect in vitro
and in mouse mammary gland. Lastly, PP inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells
harbouring PI3K mutations. Our data indicate that drug repositioning by network
analysis of oncogene-specific transcriptional signatures is an efficient strategy for
identifying oncogenic pathway inhibitors among FDA-approved compounds. We

propose that PP and Niclo should be further investigated as potential therapeutics
for the treatment of tumors or diseases carrying the constitutive activation of the
PI3K/P70S6K signalling axis.

INTRODUCTION

Three recurrent oncogenic “hotspots” account for the
majority of somatic PIK3CA mutations. Two of these
mutations, E542K and E545K, occur in the helical
domain, and the third mutation, H1047R, affects the
kinase domain. All three mutations result in enhanced lipid
kinase activity and activation of downstream targets such
as the AKT, P70S6K and S6 proteins. Pharmacological
strategies aimed at inhibiting the oncogenic activation of
the PI3K-dependent pathways are under active pre-clinical
and clinical investigation [17], [18], [19]. However,
paradigms of tumor resistance after PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
treatments are emerging [20], [21], highlighting the need
for alternative approaches to inhibit this pathway.
To test whether an oncogene specific gene signature
might assist in computational repositioning of selective
inhibitors of oncogenic pathways, we used the PI3K
oncogene as a test case. The approach is based on the
following hypothesis: if the gene signature summarizing
the effect of a drug is “anti-similar” with an oncogenic
pathway-derived signature, it is reasonable to expect
that this drug acts as pathway inhibitor, able to revert
the oncogenic signature. To this end, we queried a drug
network with an anti-similar (or reverse) oncogenic
PI3K-dependent gene signature derived from somatic
knock-in cellular models. Computational analysis
effectively identified well-known selective inhibitors
of PI3K-dependent signalling among FDA-approved
compounds. Moreover, we repositioned Niclosamide
(Niclo) and Pyrvinium Pamoate (PP), two anthelmintic
drugs, as effective inhibitors of oncogenic PI3K-dependent
signalling by inhibiting the activation of the AKT/P70S6K
signalling axis.

Targeted inhibition of oncogenic signalling
pathways represents the main goal of modern oncology:
selective inhibitors of oncogenes such as mutated kinases
have been identified mainly through traditional small
molecule drug screening, aimed at identifying inhibitors
of their catalytic activity or cellular localization. However,
ever-increasing failure rates, high cost, unsatisfactory
safety profile, and limited efficacy are often associated
with such traditional drug screens. Moreover, these
inhibitors, even when effective, show paradigms of
primary or secondary resistance [1], [2], highlighting the
need for novel efficacious and cost-effective strategies to
identify efficacious modulators of oncogenic pathways
in cells. Gene signatures associated with oncogenic
activation of molecular pathways may offer novel
opportunities for targeted therapeutics discovery in cancer.
Specific gene expression signatures can be associated
with oncogenic mutations and deregulated signalling
pathways in tumors [3], [4], [5]. One opportunity to
implement these molecular data into drug discovery
is offered by the inspection of drug networks. These
networks can be derived by computing the similarity
between gene signatures generated by drug treatments
in specific cell lines, with the assumption that each drug
treatment generates a drug-specific signature [6]. In this
drug-network, drugs can be grouped into communities
composed of drugs that produce similar transcriptional
profiles and hence may act through a similar Mode of
Action (MoA) [7]. This network-based analysis allows
to identify the MoA of novel compounds, as well as, to
repurpose drugs for novel therapeutic indications (“drug
repositioning”) [7], [8]. Moreover, the inspection of drug
networks with disease- or oncogene-associated signatures
might help repositioning drugs able to “revert” a disease
signature and, thus, the disease phenotype [9].
The PI3K proto-oncogene and its downstream
pathways offer a relevant paradigm of targeted therapies
in oncology. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR/-dependent pathways
include key modulators of cell proliferation, survival and
metabolism in epithelial cells [10], [11]. The aberrant
activation of these pathways has been identified as the
determinant driver event of tumorigenesis and constitutes
an important factor in the anticancer drug response and
clinical prognosis in different tumor types [12], [13],
[14]. In epithelial cancer, the PI3K-dependent signalling
pathway is most frequently activated by genetic alteration
such as gene copy number variation or somatic mutations
in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p110α catalytic subunit
of PI3K or inactivating mutations in PTEN [15], [16].

RESULTS
Gene expression-based drug network analysis
repositioned anthelminthic drugs as potential
inhibitors of oncogenic PI3K-dependent pathways
We have previously developed a computational
approach to predict drug MoA and drug repurposing by
using the analysis of the Connectivity Map (Cmap) [22], a
compendium of gene expression profiles (GEPs) following
drug treatment of human cell lines with 1,309 bioactive
small molecules. The approach was based on generating
a single “prototype” ranked list (PRL) of differentially
expressed genes for each drug following treatment
across multiple cell lines, or at different dosages [7, 23].

Nodes scoring higher than 0,86 were considered not significant. Note that some identified compounds are well known
pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K signalling, such as LY-294002, Wortamannin and Quinostatin. Sirolimus, a rapalog drug
targeting downstream PI3K-signalling, was also identified. The table indicated the drug class, therapeutic indication and the

based resource (referred as MANTRA 2.0) that supports
this process by exploiting similarities between druginduced and disease-induced transcriptional profiles
[24]. To reposition FDA-approved drugs that might act
as inhibitors of oncogenic PI3K­-dependent pathways,
we queried the MANTRA 2.0 drug network. To generate
oncogenic PI3K-dependent gene signatures, we took
advantage of isogenic Knock-In (KI) cell lines, in which
a normal allele in non-transformed human mammary
epithelial cells had been replaced with PIK3CA(E545K)
or PIK3CA(H1047R) alleles by somatic adenovirusmediated recombination [25-27]. Since these cells
essentially differ from their isogenic wild type counterpart
in the expression of mutated PIK3CA protein only, they
allow for the generation of a specific bona-fide oncogenic
PI3K-dependent gene signature. From each signature, we
generated a PIK3CA-reverse signature by sorting genes
in reverse order of differential expression (i.e. the most
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

down-regulated ranked at the top of the signature, while
the most up-regulated at the bottom) to generate a gene
expression profile associated with inhibition of oncogenic
PI3K-dependent pathways (Figure 1A and M&M). We
also used a gene expression signature obtained from
a MCF10A cell line carrying the PIK3CA(H1047R)
mutation treated with GDC-941, a selective inhibitor of
the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Thus, we generated three
new nodes in the MANTRA network here referred to as:
1) PIK3CA(E545K)-reverse; 2) PIK3CA(H1047R)-reverse
and 3) PIK3CA (H1047R) plus inhibitor (Figure 1A).
Computational distance analysis of these transcriptional
signatures in the MANTRA 2.0 network allowed us to
identify drugs and communities with significant distance
(threshold ≤0.86) from each of the PIK3CA-specific
nodes (Figure 1A and Table S1). Compounds common
to all three networks were then selected (Figure 1B and
Table S1). This produced a list of 27 compounds (Table

hHEY1, hTGFA and hCSGALNACT1 that were down
regulated by mutated PIK3CA (Figure 2A). In contrast,
up-regulated genes such as hCCNE2, hDSCC1, hENDOD1
and hPPP2R1B were strongly inhibited following PP or
Niclo treatments (Figure 2B). PP or Niclo treatments did
not change the expression levels of other oncogenic PI3Ktarget genes, such as hAXIN1 and hAXIN2 belonging to
the WNT pathway (Figure 2C), thus suggesting a degree
of specificity of these drugs towards PI3K target genes.
These results demonstrated that: i) PP and Niclo regulate
a subset of genes that are under the control of PI3Kdependent pathways; ii) both drugs are able to reverse
oncogene-driven gene expression.

1) that are predicted to generate transcriptional signatures
with significant similarity to the ones generated by the
inhibition of oncogenic PI3K signalling. In support of
the predictive power of our approach, we identified LY294002 and Wortmannin, two well-known inhibitors
of p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K. We also identified
Sirolimus (rapamycin), a clinically relevant small
molecule inhibitor of mTOR pathway and Quinostatin,
an inhibitor of the p110α catalitic subunit of PI3K [28]
(Table 1). Drug-network analysis also allows us to
identify enrichment of drug communities from each of the
PIK3CA-specific nodes (Table S2), indicating drug classes
significantly close to each node. Inspection of communiti
enrichment common to all three nodes strongly suggested
that antipsychotics, sodium/calcium decreasers, calcium
channel blockers and Na+/K+-ATPase (sodium potassium)
membrane pump inhibitors are predicted to negatively
regulate PI3K-dependent signalling in-silico. On the other
hand, data in Table S2 also indicate that these drug classes
might inhibit PI3K-dependent signalling as a potential
off-target effect. Notably, the repositioning approaches
based on “reverse” genetic signatures (networks 1+2) was
sufficient to identify 6 out of top 10 communities identified
through the use of a specific inhibitor-derived signature,
thus indicating that the “reverse” signature-based strategy
could help in repositioning studies for which specific
pathway inhibitors are not yet available.
Among selected drugs (Table 1), we focused our
attention on Niclosamide (Niclo) and Pyrvinium Pamoate
(PP), two FDA-approved anthelmintic drugs, as a result
of following considerations: i) recent preclinical data
have outlined anticancer effects of both compounds in
several in vitro and in vivo cancer models [29-33]; ii) the
possibility that these compounds can inhibit the oncogenic
activation of PI3K-dependent pathways was never directly
tested. We thus decided to experimentally validate the in
silico repositioning of PP or Niclo acting as inhibitors
of oncogenic, constitutively active, PI3K-dependent
signalling.

PP and Niclo

inhibit

AKT/P70S6K

We investigated the molecular mechanism by which
PP and Niclo inhibited PI3K-dependent signalling and,
thus, target gene expression. Niclo neither directly bound
nor inhibited the p110α subunit of PI3K, as tested by an
in vitro binding assay (Figure S1). PP was reported in
the literature to be inactive against PI3K [34] [39]. We
therefore implemented an antigen-capture-based assay
to test whether PP and Niclo increased or decreased the
phosphorylation and the activation of selected proteins
belonging to the PI3K-dependent signalling cascade.
We observed that treatment with Niclo significantly
decreased P70S6K and S6 phosphorylation in cells
carrying oncogenic PI3K (Figure S2). Conversely, PP
treatment reduced P70S6K phosphorylation without
affecting S6 phosphorylation (Figure S2). We confirmed
these results by immunoblot analysis, demonstrating
that Niclo treatment strongly inhibited P70S6K and S6
phosphorylation in both wild type and PIK3CA mutated
cells (Figure 3A). PP treatment also inhibited P70S6K
phosphorylayion but, notably it had a minimal effect on S6
phosphorylation after two hours of treatment (Figure 3A).
We also observed a small, but significant, inhibition of
AKT phosphorylation by PP. We subsequently evaluated
the effect of PP and Niclo treatment during serum
stimulation, which is known to activate PI3K-dependent
pathways. Under these conditions, AKT, P70S6K and
S6 phosphorylation were activated by the PI3K activity,
as demonstrated by LY treatment (Figure 3B). Similarly,
both PP and Niclo treatment strongly inhibited P70S6K
phosphorylation (Figure 3B). In addition, we confirmed
that PP did also inhibit AKT phosphorylation, conceivably
acting as a dual inhibitor. In contrast to Niclo, PP
induced a milder decrease of S6 phosphorylation (Figure
3B): this could be explained through the activation of
additional kinases, such as RSK [35] or by varying
degrees of P70S6K protein activity inhibition by different
compounds. Overall, these results confirmed that both
drugs inhibited the PI3K-dependent signalling cascade in
cells carrying the PIK3CA oncogene.

Niclo and PP control oncogenic PIK3CAdependent gene expression
In order to confirm the effective regulation of gene
expression by Niclo and PP and their ability to “reverse”
the oncogenic PI3K-dependent gene expression signature,
we selected, among the most up-regulated and downregulated genes from the PIK3CA(E545K)-reverse
signature, a short list of genes predicted to be regulated
by either PP or Niclo (Table S2). mRNA analysis from
wild type HME cells or isogenic cells carrying the
PIK3CA(E545K) allele confirmed that these genes
were differentially regulated in oncogene-carrying cells
compared with wild type control cells (Figure 2A). The
treatment with PP or Niclo was sufficient to increase the
expression of genes such as hCCNG2, hHBP1, hIL8,

Results in Figure 3A and 3B indicated that
P70S6K or P70S6K and AKT are targets of Niclo and
PP, respectively. To formally prove that inhibition of
their activities by PP and Niclo was mechanistically
linked to the regulation of target gene expression, we
pharmacologically inhibited P70S6K by using Rapamycin,
a well-known inhibitor of mTOR which is an upstream

activator of P70S6K, or PF-05212384 that similarly to PP,
acts as a dual inhibitor of both PI3K and mTOR. We then
analysed the expression of a subset of genes controlled
by PP and Niclo. mRNA analysis demonstrated that
Rapamycin was sufficient to increase the expression of
hCCNG2, hHBP1 and IL8 genes in HME cells carrying
oncogenic PIK3CA (Figure 3C), as well as in down

regulating the expression of hCCNE2 and hPPP2R1B
genes (Figure 3D). Moreover, PF-05212384 treatment
was sufficient to up-regulate the expression of hCCNG2
and hHBP1 and to down regulate the expression of
hCCNE2, hPPP2R1B and ENDOD1 (Figure 3C and 3D).
These results indicated that: i) the selected genes were
indeed under the control of AKT/P70S6K-dependent
signalling; ii) Niclo and PP regulated PI3K-dependent
gene expression, through the inhibition of the AKT/
P70S6K axis.

[27, 40-41]; moreover, PI3K/mTOR pathways accelerates
wound healing [42]. We observed that EGF-deprived wild
type MCF10A, but not MCF10A-PIK3CA(E545K) cells
showed a 50% reduction in migration in a scratch wound
healing assay indicating that, under such conditions, cell
motility was activated by oncogenic PI3K signalling
(Figure S3). We thus tested the ability of Niclo or PP
to inhibit wound healing when selectively activated by
oncogenic PI3K signals in EGF-deprived cells. The
treatment with Niclo or PP was sufficient to completely
inhibit the migration of MCF10A-PIK3CA(E545K) cells
after 14 hours (Figure 5A). We also tested the ability of
anthelmintic drugs to suppressing PI3K-dependent cellular
invasion following stimulation by attractant hormones.
Our results showed that MCF10A-PIK3CA(E545K) cells
had almost a 2.5 fold increase in cells invasion compared
with wild type isogenic cells (Figure 5B-5C). Treating
cells with Niclo or PP significantly reduced, about 50%,
the invasion of cells carrying the PIK3CA(E545K)
mutation (Figure 5B-5C).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that PP and
Niclo inhibited oncogenic PI3K-dependent cellular
phenotypes. This confirms a successful repositioning of
both drugs as negative regulators of constitutively active
PI3K-dependent pathways.

Anthelmintic drugs inhibit oncogenic PI3Kdependent cellular phenotypes
We next analyzed the effect of anthelmintic drugs
on the regulation of biological and cellular processes
sustained by AKT/mTOR/P70S6K pathways. A major
function of the AKT/mTOR molecular axis is to
activate protein synthesis, which it is thought to control
through several substrates, including the S6 kinases.
ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR such as Torin, by
blocking canonical mTORC1-dependent events, such
as the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, impair
protein synthesis and proliferation [36], [37] [38]. As
a step towards defining the ability of PP and Niclo to
inhibit AKT/S6K-dependent pathway and their cellular
functions in the context of PI3K oncogenic mutations, we
examined the effects of PP and Niclo on protein synthesis
by scoring for ribosome assembly into polysomes, an
early event in protein translation initiation. To focus
on the direct translational outputs and avoid secondary
effects, we treated cells with inhibitors for only three
hours during serum stimulated-protein synthesis. Our
results (Figure 4A) showed that, similarly to Torin2, PP
or Niclo treatment was sufficient to inhibit the recruitment
of ribosomes into polysomes in MCF10A (E545K) KI
cells after serum stimulation. These data indicated that PP
and Niclo inhibited mTOR and causes a severe defect in
translation initiation.
According to the inhibition of protein translation, the
inhibition of mTOR/P70S6K in mammary epithelial cells
has also a potent cytostatic effect [39]: one might predict
that by inhibiting these kinases activities, polysomes
assembly and protein translation, Niclo and PP might
also elicit cytostatic effects. To test this possibility, we
monitored cell proliferation and viability for 72 hours after
treatment with Niclo or PP. Our results demonstrate that
both drugs had potent cytostatic effects (upper panel), with
very minimal cytotoxicity (lower panel) in HME (Figure
4B) and MCF10A cells (Figure 4C). As expected, Niclo
and PP treatment have also cytostatic effects in isogenic
cells carrying a constitutively active, mutant PIK3CA.

PP controls mammary branching morphogenesis
and PI3K-dependent signaling of mouse
mammary gland tissue
We next tested the effect of anthelmintic drugs in
controlling proliferation and targeting the PI3K/P706SKdependent pathways in vivo, and we focused on PP.
Since in vitro studies were performed with mammary
epithelial cell lines, we assayed the effect of PP treatment
in mammary gland tissue of mice. Mammary ductal
morphogenesis depends on PI3K-dependent signalling and
PI3K activation has been directly correlated to the control
of ductal branching and alveolar cell proliferation during
mammary gland development [43]. To investigate if PP,
by inhibiting PI3K-dependent signaling in vivo, might
suppress duct morphogenesis, we analyzed mammary
gland tissue after PP treatment. Haematoxylin stained
mammary gland tissue sections showed thinning ducts
and a significant reduction of duct diameter in PP-treated
compared to control-treated mammary glands (Figure
6A-6B), thus confirming a cytostatic effect of PP in vivo
and a reduction in mammary branching morphogenesis.
Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of mammary gland
tissue sections revealed that PP effectively reduced the
level of S6 and AKT protein phosphorylation compared to
vehicle treated glands (Figure 6C-6D, Figure S5). Notably,
a substantial reduction in protein phosphorylation was
observed in both duct epithelial cells and mammary glandassociated adipocytes.

PP inhibits growth of breast cancer cells
harbouring PIK3CA mutations

[18] and have demonstrated to have clinical benefits for
the treatment of breast cancer carrying PI3K mutations
[44]. We investigated if PP, by virtue of its dual AKT and
P70S6K inhibitor activity, inhibited the growth of cancer
cells harbouring PI3K mutations. Our results demonstrated
that PP treatment was highly cytotoxic against breast
cancer cells with an average inhibitory concentration 50

Oncogenic mutations in the PI3K pathway are
frequent in breast cancers and support cancer growth as
well as resistance to HER2 targeting agents: PI3K or dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are able to kill breast cancer cells

Figure 7: PP inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells carrying PIK3CA mutations. A. Breast cancer cell lines carrying

the indicated PIK3CA mutation were seeded in 96-well plates. DMSO or Pyrvinium Pamoate (PP) was added at indicated concentrations
and cell viability was evaluated after 72 hours by the CellTiter-Glo assay. The results are the mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments
showing the percentage of cells viability over that of DMSO-treated cells. B. Upper panel: Representative graphs from Kaleidagraph

(HER2+) cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-361 and BT-474) carrying PIK3CA mutations were treated with PP at the IC50 concentration or with
Trastuzumab (Tz) alone (10μg/ml) or in combination (Tz+PP). The Transtuzumab-responsive SKBR3 cell line (HER2+/PIK3CA WildType) and Transtuzumab-resistant MCF7 (HER2-/PIK3CA(E545K)) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. C. Cell
viability after 72 hours was evaluated as in A C.. D. Soft agar colony forming assays were carried out with the indicated cancer cell lines.
1000 cells were seeded per well (2000 for BT-474) and treated with PP (at IC50 concentration) or Tz alone (10μg/ml) or in combination
with PP. Tz was added once a week for 2 consecutive weeks. Colonies were stained with crystal violet at ~4 weeks after initial seeding.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4 (www.graphpad.com). Statistical significance was determined by oneway ANOVA P value < 0.05*, P value < 0.01**, P < 0.001***.

(Ic50) of 50nM (Figures 7A and 7B). Since PI3K mutations
in HER2-positive tumors is an important determinant of
resistance to anti HER2 therapy Trastuzumab [45], we
next tested the ability of PP to kill such resistant cancer
cells compared with Trastuzumab alone or in combination.
Compared with Trastuzumab, PP treatment inhibited the
growth and soft agar colony formation of Trastuzumabresistant cancer cells (Figures 7C and 7D). Together, these
data indicated that anthelminthic PP might represent a
valuable pharmacological inhibitor of breast cancer cells
carrying PI3K mutations.

approach is sufficient to the computational repurposing of
novel pathway inhibitors. This demonstrates the strength
of the approach presented, because pathway-specific gene
signatures could be generated with high efficacy by genetic
manipulation (e.g., by means of somatic KI or Knockout targeting approaches). In contrast, pharmacological
inhibitors might not be available at times, as in case of
“undruggable” targets. Thus, the approach presented in
the manuscript could be exploited and applied to every
genetically targetable oncogenic pathway.
The herein proposed drug repositioning identifies
novel potential therapeutics, PP and Niclo to be further
investigated for the treatment of human diseases showing a
constitutive activation of PI3K/mTOR/P70S6K signalling
axis. Notably, inhibitors identified by means of genetic
signatures might offer opportunities to target aberrant
transcriptional signatures regardless of the specific
genetic lesion causing PI3K constitutive activation and
thus be effective for a larger number of PI3K-dependent
pathological phenotypes. Moreover, the inspection of
network communities close to PI3K inhibitors might help
to predict PI3K inhibitor off-target effects and, possibly,
side effects.
What molecular mechanisms link Niclo and PP to
PI3K-dependent pathway inhibition? Niclo and PP do
not directly bind and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PI3K
implying that additional or indirect mechanisms should
be considered. Niclo has been previously recognized as
a protonophore molecule that decreases intracellular pH
by extruding protons from lysosomes, thus lowering
cytoplasmic pH. This, in turn, inhibits mTORC1
signalling [47-48] and, consequently, may inhibit P70S6K
phosphorylation. In agreement with our data, previous
drug screens identified Niclo as a negative regulator of
P70S6K, without AKT inhibition [47, 49] . Conversely,
analysis of structure and reactivity similarity (Figure S4)
indicated that PP profile is not as protonophore. PP has
been proposed to target mitochondrial complex I [30] ,
thus reducing oxidative phosphorylation rate and ATP
production. PP treatment might produce a starvation-like
condition resulting in the activation of starvation-related
sensors such as AMPK, which negatively regulate both
mTOR and P70S6K phosphorylation [36]. In this scenario,
both PP and Niclo would act as indirect inhibitor of
P70S6K activity, although further molecular studies are
needed to delineate the mechanism.
In conclusion, irrespective of the PI3K pathway, we
believe that our approach represents a paradigm that can
complement drug discovery approaches for undruggable
molecular targets or aid in cases in which traditional highthroughput drug screens of inhibitors against selective
signalling pathways are likely to fail.

DISCUSSION
We propose a paradigm for exploiting large
databases of transcriptional genes signatures for
computational repositioning of drug inhibitors against
a specific oncogenic pathway, by identifying drugs able
to revert the associated oncogenic gene signature. The
in-silico identification of well-known inhibitors of the
PI3K-dependent pathway such as Sirolimus (rapamycin),
LY-294002, Wortmannin and Quinostatin demonstrates the
efficacy of the methodology to identify PI3K-dependent
pathway inhibitors and to potentially reposition novel
compounds.
In this study, the reference signature for oncogenic,
active PI3K-dependent pathways had been derived by
using isogenic KI human mammary epithelial cells
expressing the PIK3CA(E545K) or PIK3CA(H1057R)
cancer alleles, that are suitable for generating bonafide oncogene specific signatures. Several studies have
demonstrated the potential of using gene expression
profiles of cancer cells for the analysis of oncogenic
pathways, and such profiles can reflect deregulation of
specific pathways in cancers [3, 46]. Thus, our approach
could potentially be exploited for the repositioning of
drugs targeting oncogenic deregulated pathways identified
by tumor-derived signatures. It is worth observing that
oncogenes transcriptional outputs might differ among
different tissues and this could explain the different role
of oncogenic pathway among different tumors. Moreover,
the cooperation among oncogenes and tumor suppressors
genes, frequently occurring with tissue specificity, should
be also considered. Thus, the transcriptional output of
oncogenic signalling might have a certain degree of tissue
specificity.
We demonstrated that nodes generated by oncogeneinduced signatures or inhibitor-induced signatures are both
efficient in searching for computational similarities in drug
networks; however, combining both approaches would be
extremely powerful, by increasing stringency for drugs
discovery and by limiting the likelihood of false positive.
If available, the inhibitor-induced signatures can assist
the oncogene signatures-based approach in increasing the
efficiency of computational repurposing methods. In the
case of the PI3K pathway, the oncogene-induced signatures

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mantra 2.0 analysis and community enrichment
Gene expression profiles were compared to those
previously generated for 1,309 compounds (cMAP) [22]
by computing the transcriptional similarity between our
profiles and each of the 1,309 compounds as previously
described [7]. Specifically, Affymetrix microarrays .CEL
files were uploaded in the MANTRA on-line tool (http://
mantra.tigem.it) and automatically transformed into a
new node in the drug network [24]. MANTRA computed
the transcriptional similarity between each treatment and
each of the 1,309 compounds in cMAP. The transcriptional
similarity is quantified as a distance, which is a number
greater or equal to zero, with zero indicating identical
profiles [7]. We then selected all drugs that scored
below a transcriptional distance threshold of 0.86 from
all our profiles. A set of 27 drugs were thus selected to
be significantly similar to our signatures. Community
enrichment analyses were performed as previously
described [7]. According to the neighbors of each profile a
hypergeometric test was applied and a pValue threshold of
0.05 was used to identify the communities more enriched
for each profile.

Cell lines
Mammary epithelial hTERT-HME1 (HME),
MCF10A and isogenic derivatives carrying specific cancer
alleles have been described previously [26] and were
cultured as described [26]. The MCF7, HCC1954, BT474, MDA-MB-361 and SKBR3 cell lines were obtained
from ATCC and cultured according to the provider’s
instructions.

RNA target preparation/affymetrix microarray
studies
Gene expression analysis was carried out using
RNA extracted from sub-confluent cell cultures using an
Invitrogen kit. RNA samples of sufficient quality were
profiled on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 chips. Preparation
of complementary RNA, array hybridizations, scanning
and subsequent array image data analysis were done using
the manufacturer’s specified protocol.

Cell viability and soft agar colony assay were
performed as previously described [26]

Evaluation and normalization of affymetrix genechip
data and generation of reverse signature
The data were analyzed with the Bioconductor
package “Affy” using the RMA method for normalizing
and summarizing probe level intensity measurements. The
profile “1” (HME­PIK3CA(E545K) - Reverse signature)
had been processed before to make it compatible with
the standard of Mantra. We have developed a method
to convert “Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0” probes into
Affymetrix HG-U133A probes (chip reference for the
network of Mantra). The conversion was carried out in
two steps: 1) from “Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0” probe_
set_id towards “Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0” gene:
each probe set id was associated with the corresponding
gene, based on Affymetrix annotation. If more than one
probe was found to be associated with the same gene, we
assigned to the gene the rank of the probe that comes first
in the ranking. 2) from “Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0”
gene towards “Affymetrix HG-U-133A” probe_set_id:
we associated to each gene the corresponding HG-U133A probe set, using the Affymetrix annotation file. If
a gene was associated with more than one probe set, we
assigned the same ranking to all of the probes involved.
For Affymetrix probes that did not generate any matches
we positioned them at the center of the ranking. We
then integrated them in the drug network as previously
described [23]. The other two profiles were obtained from
Array Express ID “E-GEOD-17785”. In this case the
chip HG-U133_Plus_2 was already compatible with the
reference chip of Mantra.
