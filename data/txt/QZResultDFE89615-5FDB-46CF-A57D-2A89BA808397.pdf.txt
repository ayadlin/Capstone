Abstract
CCR3 is a specific marker of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cells. ALCL cells also express CCL11, a
ligand for CCR3, leading to the hypothesis that CCL11 may play an autocrine role in ALCL progression. In this
study, we investigated a role of CCL11 in cell survival and growth of human Ki-JK cells, established from an ALCL
patient, and murine EL-4 lymphoma cells. Both Ki-JK and EL-4 cells expressed cell surface CCR3. CCL11
increased cell survival rates of Ki-JK cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it promoted EL-4 cell
proliferation. Furthermore, CCL11 induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/
2 in both Ki-JK cells and EL-4 cells. Cell survival and tumor proliferation promoted by CCL11 was completely
blocked by inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. CCL11 induced expression of antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL and
survivin, in Ki-JK cells. CCL11 also enhanced tumor growth of EL-4 and Ki-JK cells in vivo. Consistent with these
results, tumor cells of cutaneous ALCL expressed CCR3 and increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, Bcl-xL,
and survivin in situ. Thus, our findings prompt a novel therapeutic approach to treat relapses of an aggressive
form of lymphoma based on the discovery that a cell surface marker of disease functions as a critical autocrine
growth receptor. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2056–65. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is composed of
anaplastic large cells expressing the CD30 antigen (1). Extranodal involvement is common and skin is the most frequently
affected organ. In some cases with systemic ALCL, tumor cells
express anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), indicative of the
2;5 chromosomal translocation or its variants (1). Extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is one of the downstream
mediators of nucleophosmin/ALK signaling in ALKþ ALCL,
which may be involved in the pathogenesis (2). It remains,
however, unknown how tumor cells get activated and proliferate in cases with ALK ALCL including cutaneous ALCL.
Multiple factors contribute to the progression of neoplasms.
Among them, chemokines can directly promote tumor cell
growth (3–5). Chemokines are classified into 4 types: CC chemokines, CXC chemokines, C chemokine, and CX3C chemokine (6).
There are emerging data suggesting that signaling through
chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions is implicated with
tumor growth and invasion of several cancer types, including

lymphomas, in an autocrine/paracrine manner. For examples,
interactions between CCL1/ CCR8 are involved in adult T-cell
leukemia (7), CXCL13/CXCR5 in several mouse and human
carcinoma cell lines (8), CCL20/CCR6 in colorectal cancer cells
(9), CXCL1 and CXCL2/CXCR2 in esophageal cancers (10), and
CXCL10/CXCR3 in nasal NK/T cell lymphoma (11). In most cases
of ALCL, tumor cells express CCR3 (12, 13). ALCL cells also
express CCL11, a ligand for CCR3 (12), leading to the hypothesis
that CCL11 may play an autocrinerolein ALCL pathogenesis (14).
CCL11 has potent chemotactic activity for CCR3-positive
cells (15–17). In cutaneous tissue components, CCL11 is
produced by fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells
(18–20). Furthermore, CCL11 production is promoted in a
variety of inflammatory diseases such as allergic asthma (21,
22), allergic rhinitis (23), and atopic dermatitis (24, 25).
In this current report, we demonstrate that CCL11–CCR3
interactions induce cell survival and proliferation of CCR3þ
lymphoma cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK
kinase (MEK) inhibitors completely blocked the cell survival and
growth stimulatory effects of CCL11. CCL11 also promoted
tumor growth of CCR3þ lymphoma cells in vivo. Therefore,
we propose that constitutive MAPK/ERK activation through the
CCL11/CCR3 axis may be critical for the progression of ALCL.

CCL11–CCR3 Interactions Promote Survival of ALCL

All experiments were performed using female mice between 8
and 14 weeks of age. All studies were approved by the animal
ethics review board of the University of Tokyo and the
Animal Committee of National Center for Global Health
and Medicine.
Cell lines
Human ALCL cell line, Ki-JK, was purchased from the
Health Science Research Resources Bank (Sennan). Ki-JK cells
were established from a child with ALCL in the inguinal lesion,
including skin, and they expressed CD25, CD30, CD45RO,
HLA-DR, and epithelial membrane antigen (26). They were
characterized by PCR assay using short tandem repeat. Mouse
lymphoma cell line, EL-4, and mouse malignant melanoma cell
line, B16, were kindly given by Dr Sam T. Hwang (Medical
College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI). Ki-JK cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 (Millipore) with 10% FBS and supplements (penicillin G sodium, streptomycin sulphate, and
amphotericin B). EL-4 and B16 cells were grown in Eagle's
minimum essential medium (MEM; Sigma) with 10% FBS and
supplements.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay
Messenger RNA (mRNA) was obtained from lesional skin of
patients with cutaneous ALCL (n ¼ 5) and normal skin (n ¼ 5)
using illustra QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (GE
Healthcare). All samples were collected during daily clinical
practice. The medical ethical committee of the University of
Tokyo approved all described studies and the study was
conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles.
Informed consent was obtained to use skin samples. We also
obtained mRNA from mouse skin before and 11 days after
injection with EL-4 cells. cDNA was synthesized using TaqMan
Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed as
described previously (27). Primers for human genes were as
follows: CCR3 forward, 50 -TCG TTC TCC CTC TGC TCG TT-30
and reverse, 50 -GCC GGA TGG CCT TGT ACT TT-30 ; CCL11
forward, 50 -GGG CCA GCT TCT GTC CCA AC-30 and reverse,

Flow cytometric analysis of CCR3 expression on cell
lines
Cells (2  106) were stained with rat anti-human CCR3 or
rat anti-mouse CCR3 monoclonal antibody (mAb; R&D systems) followed by fluorescein-conjugated secondary Ab (BD
Biosciences Pharmingen). FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson) were used. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and percentages of cells in each
quadrant were determined.

Apoptosis assays
Cells were plated onto 6-well plates at 1  105 per well.
Human or mouse CCL11 (R&D systems) was added to final
concentration of 0.01 to 1.0 mg/mL and cells were cultured as
indicated (Ki-JK for 16 hours, EL-4 for 72 hours, and B16 for 48
hours) after preincubation with or without 10 mmol/L
PD98059, U0126, or LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology)
for 1 hour. Apoptosis was analyzed using Annexin V FITC
(fluorescein isothiocyanate) Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD
Biosciences Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Proliferation assays by cell count
Cells were plated onto 6-well plates at 1  105 per well.
Human or mouse CCL11 was added to final concentration of
0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL and cells were cultured as indicated (Ki-JK for
16 hours, EL-4 for 48 hours, and B16 for 24 hours) after
preincubation with or without 10 mmol/L U0126 or
LY294002 for 1 hour. Cells were counted using the Coulter
Counter (Beckman Coulter).
BrdU cell proliferation assay
EL-4 cells (5  104) were cultured for 18 hours with mouse
CCL11 at 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL. Cells were stained with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 2 hours and reacted with anti-BrdU
Ab peroxidase conjugate followed by peroxidase substrate
using Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU (Roche Applied Science).
Sulfuric acid was added to the solution to terminate enzyme
activity. Optical densities were measured at 450 nm using a
550 microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Western blotting
Ki-JK and EL-4 cells were cultured in 6-well plates with
human or mouse CCL11 at 1.0 mg/mL for 1 or 5 minutes or 16
hours. After collecting proteins, SDS-PAGE was performed as
previously described (28). After transfer to nitrocellulose
membrane (Invitrogen), the membrane was blotted with
Abs against ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (phosphoERK1/2), Bcl-xL, and survivin (Cell Signaling Technology)
for overnight at 4 C and with the appropriate secondary
Abs for 1 hour at room temperature. Visualization was performed by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).
Intracellular flow cytometric analysis of
phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt
Ki-JK and EL-4 cells (1  105) were cultured with human or
mouse CCL11 at 1.0 mg/mL as indicated (Ki-JK for 16 hours
and EL-4 for 24 hours) after preincubation with or without 10
mmol/L U0126 after or LY294002 for 1 hour. After brief
incubation with SYTOX Red Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen),
Ki-JK cells were permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm
Kit (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Staining for phosphoERK1/2 or phospho-Akt was performed with rabbit antiphosphorylated ERK1/2 monoclonal Ab or rabbit antiphosphorylated Akt monoclonal Ab, respectively (Cell Signaling
Technology) followed by Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary Ab (Invitrogen).

In vivo animal experiments
EL-4 cells (5  106), B16 cells (2  106), or Ki-JK cells (5 
106) in 100 mL of PBS with 1.0 mg/mL CCL11 (CCL11 group) or
without CCL11 (PBS group) were injected subcutaneously into
the shaved left flank of C57BL/6 mice or SCID mice. On days 4,
7, and 11, 1.0 mg/mL CCL11 in 100 mL of PBS was injected into
the lesion in CCL11 group, whereas PBS was injected in PBS
group. On days 4, 7, 11, and 14, we measured 2 perpendicular
diameters and determined tumor size. In other experiments,
EL-4 cells in 100 mL of PBS with 100 mmol/L U0126, 1.0 mg/mL
mouse CCL11 þ 100 mmol/L U0126 100 mg/ml, anti-mouse
CCL11 Ab (R & D systems), and 1.0 mg/mL mouse CCL11 þ 100
mg/mL anti-mouse CCL11 Ab were injected subcutaneously
into the shaved left flank of C57BL/6 mice. Each reagent was
injected under the same schedule as described above.
Immunohistochemistry
We performed immunohistochemical staining with lesional
skin with cutaneous ALCL (n ¼ 8) as previously described (29).
Primary Abs against CD30, CCR3 (MBL International), phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz), Bcl-xL, survivin (Cell
Signaling Technology), and isotype-matched control were
used.
Statistical analysis
All in vitro experiments were repeated at least 3 times and
mean  SD or SEM was determined. Statistical analysis
between 2 groups was performed using the Welch's t test.
Mann–Whitney's U test was used to determine statistical

significance of quantitative real time RT-PCR differences
and in vivo experimental differences. P values of < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results
CCR3 expression on tumor cells of ALCL in vivo and in
vitro
Tumor cells of cutaneous ALCL are reported to express
CCL11 and CCR3 by immunohistochemistry (12). We first
showed that expression levels of CCL11 and CCR3 mRNA in
the lesional skin of ALCL were significantly higher than those
in normal skin (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 1A and
B). Expression levels of CCL11 and CCR3 mRNA significantly
correlated with one another (r ¼ 1.0, P < 0.01). We next
investigated CCR3 expression on the cell surface of lymphoma
cell lines by flow cytometry. Both Ki-JK cells and EL-4 cells
expressed CCR3 on the surface, but B16 cells did not (Fig. 1C).
For the following study, we decided to use Ki-JK and EL-4
cells to investigate function of CCR3 in human and mouse
lymphoma cells.
CCL11 promotes cell survival of Ki-JK cells and
proliferation of EL-4 cells
To assess effects of CCL11 on CCR3þ cells, we stimulated
Ki-JK cells, EL-4 cells, and B16 cells with CCL11 under serum
deprivation conditions and examined cell survival by staining
Annexin V. Annexin V-negative, propidium iodide (PI)-negative Ki-JK cells (live cells) were increased by stimulation with

CCL11 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B). CCL11,
however, did not promote cell survival of EL-4 cells or B16 cells
(data not shown). We further addressed if CCL11 may increase
the absolute cell number. CCL11 dose dependently increased
cell number of EL-4 cells (Fig. 2C). CCL11 slightly increased KiJK cell number (data not shown). Cell number of B16 cells was
unchanged (data not shown). Moreover, CCL11 increased
proliferation of EL-4 cells as shown by BrdU uptake
(Fig. 2D). Thus, CCL11 promoted cell survival of CCR3þ KiJK cells and augmented proliferation of CCR3þ EL-4 cells.
CCL11 induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Ki-JK and
EL-4 cells
CCL11 induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in several cell
types expressing CCR3 (30–32). Thus, we then determined
whether CCL11 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in Ki-JK
and EL-4 cells. CCL11 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in
Ki-JK cells (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which was
detected in unstimulated EL-4 cells, was modestly increased
by stimulation with CCL11 (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these
results, we detected strong induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Ki-JK cells and modest induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in EL-4 cells by CCL11 with flow cytometric analysis
(Fig. 3C). To investigate the importance of ERK1/2 phosphorylation on Ki-JK cell survival, Ki-JK cells were stained with
Dead Red in addition to intracellular phosphorylated ERK1/2.
As shown in Figure 3D, most phosphorylated ERK1/2-positive
Ki-JK cells cultured with CCL11 remained alive. The ratios
(mean  SD) of phosphorylated ERK1/2-positive live Ki-JK
cells with or without CCL11 were 17.0%  4.4% and 3.3% 

1.2%, respectively (P < 0.05). Thus, CCL11 induced ERK1/2
phosphorylation in Ki-JK and EL-4 cells.
MEK inhibitors suppress the cell survival and growth
stimulatory effects caused by CCL11
To determine whether ERK1/2 phosphorylation is involved
in CCL11-induced biological effects in CCR3þ cells, Ki-JK and
EL-4 cells were pretreated with a MEK inhibitor before CCL11
stimulation. We first stimulated Ki-JK cells with CCL11
after pretreatment with U0126 or DMSO (control) under
serum deprivation conditions and examined survival rate
and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by intracellular flow cytometry. Pretreatment with a MEK inhibitor decreased live phosphorylated ERK1/2-positive cells (36.0%  5.0%–11.7% 
4.0%), whereas it increased dead phosphorylated ERK1/2negative cells in almost equal numbers (22.3%  5.1%–
50.3%  5.9%; Fig. 4A). Using flow cytometric analysis for
Annexin V staining, we confirmed that MEK inhibitors completely blocked the cell survival effects induced by CCL11
(Fig. 4B). A MEK inhibitor (U0126) was able to completely
block CCL11-mediated cell growth in EL-4 cells (Fig. 4C). Thus,
an MEK inhibitor completely abolished CCL11-promoted cell
survival in Ki-JK cells and CCL11-augmented proliferation in
EL-4 cells.
Akt pathway is not associated with the cell survival and
growth effects of CCL11
Akt pathway is also important for cell survival and growth
induced by chemokines. Thus, we determined to investigate
Akt involvement in CCL11-mediated cell survival and growth.

CCL11-mediated cell survival (Fig. 5A and B). PI3K inhibition
did not impair cell growth effects induced by CCL11 in EL-4
cells; although, total cell numbers decreased probably because

CCL11 enhances tumor growth of EL-4 cells in vivo,
which is blocked by MEK inhibition or anti-CCL11 Ab
On the basis of the data above, we assessed effects of CCL11
on EL-4 cells in vivo. EL-4 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the left flank of C57BL/6 mice, followed by repeated
treatment with CCL11. Significantly larger tumors were
formed in the mice treated with CCL11, compared with those
treated with PBS (Fig. 6A). We also assessed effects of an MEK
inhibitor on tumor growth of EL-4 cells in vivo. We observed
significantly smaller tumors in the mice treated with U0126 or
CCL11 þ U0126 (Fig. 6A). To address the specificity, we next
injected EL-4 cells with anti-CCL11 Ab or CCL11 þ anti-CCL11
Ab. Anti-CCL11 Ab suppressed tumor formation to the same
extent as U0126, and the effect of additional CCL11 injection
was blocked by anti-CCL11 Ab (Fig. 6A). These results indicated the presence of CCL11 to active CCR3 in the injected
skin. Indeed, CCL11 mRNA expression in the lesional skin was
increased after tumor formation (Fig. 6B). As expected, CCL11
did not induce tumor growth of B16 cells (Fig. 6C). We also
assessed effects of CCL11 on Ki-JK cells in vivo. Ki-JK cells were
injected subcutaneously into SCID mice, followed by repeated
treatment with CCL11 or PBS. Significantly larger tumors were
formed in the mice treated with CCL11, compared with those
treated with PBS (Fig. 6D). Thus, CCL11 promoted EL-4 and
Ki-JK cell tumor growth in vivo, whereas MEK inhibition or
neutralization of CCL11 suppressed it.

Bcl-xL and survivin expression in CCL11-stimulated
Ki-JK cells in vitro and ALCL tumor cells in situ
We next investigated the expression of antiapoptotic proteins in Ki-JK cells. We stimulated Ki-JK cells with CCL11
under serum deprivation and measured protein levels of BclxL and survivin, both of which are reported to be upregulated
via phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (33–37). CCL11 increased BclxL and survivin protein expression in Ki-JK cells (Fig. 7A).
We next immunolabeled samples of ALCL lesional skin for
CD30, CCR3, phosphorylated ERK1/2, Bcl-xL, and survivin.
Diffuse infiltration of CD30þ atypical large cells was seen in all
cases (Fig. 7B and data not shown). As previously reported (12,
13), tumor cells expressed CCR3 (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, in all
cases of ALCL, phosphorylated ERK1/2, Bcl-xL, and survivin
were constitutively expressed in tumor cells (Fig. 7B). On the
other hand, inflammatory lymphocytes around the tumor
were negative for phosphorylated ERK1/2, Bcl-xL, and survivin
(Fig. 7B). Staining with isotype-matched control was also
negative (data not shown). Thus, Bcl-xL and survivin were
expressed in CCL11-stimulated Ki-JK cells in vitro, and ALCL
tumor cells expressed these antiapoptotic proteins in situ.

Discussion
Tumor cells of cutaneous ALCL are reported to express
CCR3 and its ligand, CCL11 (12, 13). In this study, we demonstrated cell survival effects of CCL11–CCR3 interactions in
ALCL cells. CCL11 increased cell survival rates and promoted
proliferation of CCR3þ lymphoma cells via ERK pathway. We
also showed Bcl-xL and survivin expression in CCL11-stimulated lymphoma cells in vitro and ALCL tumor cells in situ.

Figure 6. CCL11 enhances tumor growth of EL-4 cells in vivo, which is blocked by MEK inhibition or neutralization of CCL11. A, EL-4 cells were
injected into shaved abdomen of C57BL/6 mice with PBS, CCL11 (1.0 mg/mL), U0126 (100 mmol/L), CCL11 þ U0126, anti-CCL11 Ab (20 mg/mL), or
CCL11 þ anti-CCL11 Ab. B, CCL11 mRNA expression levels in mouse abdominal skin before and 11 days after EL-4 injection. Values are means
and SEM (n ¼ 6). *, P < 0.05 by Mann–Whitney U test. C, B16 cells were injected into C57BL/6 mice with CCL11 (1.0 mg/mL) or PBS. D, Ki-JK cells were injected
into SCID mice with CCL11 (1.0 mg/mL) or PBS. Each reagent was injected on days 4, 7, and 11. Tumor size was calculated as (long axis  short axis) on
days 4, 7, 11, and 14. Values are means and SEM (n ¼ 6–10). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 by Mann–Whitney U test compared with PBS group (A, C, D).

Thus, these results suggest that signaling through CCR3 on
ALCL cells is involved in tumor survival and growth via ERK1/2
activation.
CCR3 expression on ALCL tumor cells has been previously
shown by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (12, 13).
We first showed that CCL11 and CCR3 mRNA expression in
lesional skin of ALCL was significantly higher than normal
skin (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, CCL11 and CCR3 mRNA expression significantly correlated with one another (r ¼ 1.0, P <
0.01). CCL11 is expressed by dermal fibroblasts, endothelial
cells, and dendritic cells in the skin (18–20), whereas CCR3 is
expressed on eosinophils, basophils, and subpopulations of T
cells (15–17). Therefore, CCL11 may play a paracrine role as
well as an autocrine role in the lesional skin of ALCL.
We next investigated effects of CCL11 on CCR3þ cells in
vitro using Ki-JK and EL-4 cells. We revealed that CCL11
increased cell survival in Ki-JK cells and induced cell proliferation in EL-4 cells (Fig. 2). We did not see increased cell
survival of EL-4 cells stimulated with CCL11, probably because
EL-4 cells showed quite high survival and proliferation rates
under baseline culture conditions. On the other hand, Ki-JK

2062

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

cells did not proliferate well under serum deprivation conditions, which may be the reason why CCL11 did not induce cell
proliferation of Ki-JK cells. In fact, in previous reports, CCL11
increased survival rate of eosinophils, which do not show high
proliferation rate (38, 39). Moreover, CCL11 induced proliferation of a renal cell carcinoma cell line and an ovarian cell
carcinoma cell line (40, 41). Taken together, it is likely that we
can detect cell survival effects in cells showing little proliferation, whereas growth stimulatory effects can easily be detected
in actively proliferating cells. CCL11 did not increase cell
survival rate or proliferation of B16 cells (data not shown),
suggesting that cell survival and growth stimulatory effects are
specific to CCR3þ cells.
CCL11–CCR3 interactions induce phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 in eosinophils, bronchial epithelial cells, and mast
cells (30–32). We also revealed that CCL11 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both Ki-JK and EL-4cells (Fig. 3). Moreover, most phosphorylated ERK1/2-positive Ki-JK cells
were alive. Pretreatment with a MEK inhibitor decreased
live phosphorylated ERK1/2-positive cells and increased
dead phosphorylated ERK1/2-negative cells in almost equal

numbers (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 is associated with the cell survival effects of CCL11
in Ki-JK cells. Recently, the same signal pathway was reported
to be involved in the growth stimulatory effects of CCL11 on
ovarian carcinoma cells (41). EL-4 cells showed phosphorylation of ERK1/2 even without stimulation (Fig. 3B and C),
which may account for high survival and proliferation rates of
these cells even under serum deprivation. The PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway is also important for cell survival and
growth induced by chemokines. However, in this study,
CCL11-induced phosphorylation of Akt was not detected by
intracellular flow cytometry (Fig. 5A and data not shown). In
addition, PI3K inhibition had no effect on CCL11-mediated
cell survival and growth effects (Fig. 5). Total cell numbers
decreased when EL-4 cells were cultured with a PI3K inhibitor

www.aacrjournals.org

probably because of inhibition of CCL11-independent Akt
phosphorylation. Therefore, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
may be important for cell survival and growth, but is not a
major pathway for CCL11–CCR3 interactions.
We also showed that CCL11 induced tumor growth of EL-4
cells in vivo (Fig. 6A). In addition, a MEK inhibitor or antiCCL11 neutralizing Ab suppressed tumor growth of EL-4 cells
to almost the same extent in vivo (Fig. 6A), suggesting that
U0126 suppressed tumor growth not due to off target effects
but by blocking CCL11-induced ERK pathway. We did not
detect CCL11 expression by EL-4 cells as well as Ki-JK cells
(data not shown). It is likely that MEK inhibition or CCL11
neutralization suppressed tumor growth in vivo because a
variety of cells in murine skin can produce CCL11 (19, 42).
CCL11 expression in dermal fibroblasts is enhanced by interleukin-4, which is abundantly expressed in lesional skin of
ALCL (42, 43). Indeed, we detected enhanced CCL11 mRNA
expression in the mouse skin where EL-4 cells had been
injected, which was consistent with clinical data (Figs. 1A
and 6B). We also showed that CCL11 induced tumor growth of
Ki-JK cells in vivo (Fig. 6D). Collectively, in the lesional skin of
ALCL, CCL11, which is produced by not only tumor cells but
also surrounding cells, may play important roles for tumor
growth via ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Indeed, tumor cells of
cutaneous ALCL expressed phosphorylated ERK1/2 in situ
(Fig. 7). Blocking ERK signaling pathway may offer a novel
approach to treatment of ALCL.
We next investigated the expression of antiapoptotic proteins in ALCL. We focused on Bcl-xL and survivin, both of
which are reported to be induced via phosphorylation of ERK
pathway (33–37). We showed that CCL11 increased Bcl-xL and
survivin expression in Ki-JK cells in vitro (Fig. 7A). Moreover,
we detected expression of those proteins on tumor cells of
cutaneous ALCL in situ (Fig. 7B). Bcl-xL expression in nodal
ALCL has been previously reported, suggesting that antiapoptotic effects caused by this protein may explain development
and growth of lymphoma cells (44, 45). Survivin, a member
of the inhibitor of apoptosis family, is overexpressed in a
variety of human cancers (46). Taken together, our results
indicate that Bcl-xL and survivin may be involved in the
cell survival and growth stimulatory effects induced by
CCL11 in ALCL.
In summary, we showed that CCL11 increased survival rate
and induces cell growth of ALCL through activation of ERK1/
2. CCL11 also increased Bcl-xL and survivin expression. Thus,
our findings prompt a novel therapeutic approach to treat
relapses of an aggressive form of lymphoma based on the
discovery that a cell surface marker of disease functions as a
critical autocrine growth receptor.
