Abstract
Although the cancer cell cytoskeleton is a clinically validated target, few new strategies have emerged for selectively targeting cell division by modulating the cytoskeletal structure, particularly ways that could avoid the cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effects of current agents such as taxanes. We address this gap by describing a novel class of
small-molecule agonists of the mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins, which act downstream of Rho
GTPases to assemble actin ﬁlaments, and their organization with microﬁlaments to establish and maintain
cell polarity during migration and asymmetric division. GTP-bound Rho activates mDia family members by disrupting the interaction between the DID and DAD autoregulatory domains, which releases the FH2 domain to modulate
actin and microtubule dynamics. In screening for DID–DAD disruptors that activate mDia, we identiﬁed two
molecules called intramimics (IMM-01 and -02) that were sufﬁcient to trigger actin assembly and microtubule
stabilization, serum response factor-mediated gene expression, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In vivo analysis of
IMM-01 and -02 established their ability to slow tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of colon cancer. Taken
together, our work establishes the use of intramimics and mDia-related formins as a new general strategy for therapeutic targeting of the cytoskeletal remodeling machinery of cancer cells. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6793–803. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The mammalian Diaphanous-related (mDia) formin family
of Rho-effector proteins generates linear actin ﬁlaments
(F-actin) and modulates microtubule dynamics to support the
establishment and maintenance of polarity in cells (1). These
structural changes occur in response to demands during
developmental and immunologic processes (2). Defects in
formin genes are associated with an array of human diseases
including inherited deafness, autism, and kidney disease (3, 4).
In cancer, tumor cells may rely upon formins to generate
invasive structures during metastasis (5). However, although
metastatic cells may rely upon formins for migration, there is
genetic, cellular, and pharmacologic evidence that argues for a
role for formins in tumor suppression (6). Consistent with such
a role, knockout of the formin mDia1 in mice leads to a
myelodysplastic, preleukemic phenotype (7), and suppression
of the DIAPH3 gene for mDia2 is associated with prostate
neoplasia (8). Expression of a dominant interfering variant of
its effector mDia1 accelerates tumor growth and impairs

response to the farnesyl transferase inhibitor tipifarnib (6),
which relies on the small GTP-binding protein RhoB for growth
inhibition and apoptosis (9). Tipifarnib has had limited clinical
success, yet it remains in development for treatment of a
variety of cancers (10).
Informed by genetic and molecular studies of Rho and
formin signaling to the cytoskeleton and the nucleus, we
hypothesized that pharmacologic activation of formins would
impair malignant progression. In addition, activation of formins would stabilize microtubule (11) and actin dynamics (12)
as a means to target tumor cell proliferation. Taxol binds
directly to tubulin subunits to potently stabilize microtubules
and is an effective therapeutic agent (13). As a result of formin
activation, cell growth and metastatic processes would be
impaired, interfering with the normal cytoskeletal pliancy that
cancer cells rely on. To test this hypothesis, we screened for,
and identiﬁed, two chemically similar molecules that block the
Rho-controlled intramolecular autoinhibitory mechanism
(12, 14–16). We then tested their potential as anticancer agents.

High-throughput DID–DAD binding screen
The ﬂuorescence anisotropy assay measures changes in
polarization due to the binding of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled DAD peptide—T-G-V-M-D-S-L-L-E-A-L-Q-S-GA-A-F-R-D-Y-G-R-K-K-R-Q-R-R-R; derived from the peptide
sequence of mDia2 (12)—to puriﬁed recombinant mDia2 DID
protein. We developed the assay to determine how structural
differences affect DAD–DID binding (17).

For high-throughput screening, the assay buffer contained
25 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.2 (Sigma-Aldrich), NaCl 100 mmol/L,
MgCl2 10 mmol/L, and CHAPS 5 mmol/L. Assays were run in
black Matrical MP101, polypropylene 384-well microtiter
plates. A solution of DID protein (200 nmol/L, 2 ﬁnal concentration) and ﬂuorescein-labeled DAD peptide (200 nmol/L
from a 1 mmol/L stock solution) was prepared in assay buffer.
Unlabeled DAD peptide was diluted from a 1 mmol/L stock
solution to 50 mmol/L (10 ﬁnal concentration) in assay buffer.
The assay for high-throughput screening using the Michigan
High-Throughput Screening Center (MHTSC) chemical library
(18) was as follows. Assay buffer (14.5 mL) was dispensed into
each well of a 384-well plate. Using the TiMo head on the Tecan
Freedom EVO robot, 0.5 mL of 1 mmol/L test compounds was
dispensed to each assay well and mixed. The ﬁnal concentration of test compounds was 17 mmol/L and the ﬁnal dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration was 1.7%. Uninhibited control
wells (44 per plate) received 0.5 mL of DMSO from compound
plates. Fully inhibited control wells (four per plate) received 3
mL of 10-fold excess unlabelled DAD peptide. All wells received
15 mL of the mDia DID protein/ﬂuorescein–DAD peptide
solution. The plates were incubated at room temperature for
30 minutes and then polarization was measured using a BMG
Pherastar reader.
In silico molecular modeling
The Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) program (18) was
used for protein and ligand preparation. Formin DID structures (2F31.PDB #88037; ref. 19) were retrieved from www.rcsb.
org and manipulated with the ICM program. The molecular
structures of IMM-01, -02, and -03 were constructed in the ICM
interface. These small molecules were docked into the DID–
DAD interaction interface groove with default parameters
implemented in the ICM program. The binding surfaces were
produced by ICM PocketFinder (20).
Cell culture and nuclear microinjection
Cells were maintained in 0.05% fetal calf serum (FCS) 18
hours before microinjection or drug treatment. Alternatively,
serum response element (SRE)-lacZ or 3DA.FosHA NIH 3T3
reporter cell lines (21) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) FCS and 100 ng/mL G418. The serum response element
SRE-LacZ expresses b-galactosidase under the control of three
tandem SREs (21). The 3DA.Fos reporter contains the c-Fos
gene under the control of three SREs (3DA) and a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag inserted into the fourth exon (22). SW480
colon carcinoma cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS. Drug treatments were conducted in
appropriate medium with vehicle (DMSO) controls.
Antibodies, plasmids, and other reagents
Antibodies used in this study include anti-HA (clone 12CA5),
generated at the Van Andel Research Institute Monoclonal
Antibody core facility; anti-Egr1 (Cell Signaling Technology);
and anti-b-tubulin (clone E7) from the Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank. The rabbit anti-mDia2 (1358; ref. 23) was
raised against the mDia2 FH2 domain generated in bacteria.

The mouse anti-mDia1 (p140mDia1) was obtained from BD
Biosciences. The anti-glu-tubulin (glu-tub) was a generous gift
from G. Gunderson (Columbia University); anti-glu-tub recognizes tubulin after posttranslational modiﬁcation to expose a
Glu residue at the C-terminus (24). The rabbit anti-caspase-3
(cleaved) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology
(Asp175, catalog #9664). Annexin V-FITC was from BD-Pharmingen (catalog #556420). The anti-rabbit and anti-mouse
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from
GE Healthcare/Amersham. The anti-rabbit conjugated to
FITC, anti-mouse conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), FITC- and TRITC-conjugated donkey
anti-mouse secondary antibodies, and donkey anti-rabbit antisera conjugated to Oregon Green were from Jackson Laboratories. F-actin was monitored using TRITC-labeled phalloidin
(Molecular Probes/Invitrogen).
Plasmids for the expression of EGFP-DAD, DAD-M1041A,
and mDia1-FH2-DN were described previously (12, 17, 25).
Cytochalasin D (cytoD) and latrunculin B (LatB) were purchased from Calbiochem. Intramimics (IMM-01 and -02) were
resuspended in DMSO.
Microinjection, microscopy, Western blots, and reporter
assays
Egr1, glu-tub, and FosHA expression was monitored by
indirect immunoﬂuorescence, as described previously (11,
21). FosHA expression was quantiﬁed as the percentage of
HA-positive nuclei in GFP- or yellow ﬂuorescent proteinexpressing cells. b-Galactosidase (b-gal) activity was measured
using the proprietary Pierce b-Galactosidase Assay Reagent
(Pierce). In brief, 1  105 cells per well were serum starved
(0.05% FCS) for 14 hours in 12-well plates before stimulation
with agent. Three hours after stimulation, the medium was
removed and replaced with 300 mL of b-gal reagent. Plates were
incubated at 37 C. b-Gal reactions were terminated after 30
minutes with 100 mL of b-Galactosidase Assay Stop Solution
(Pierce). Absorbance at 405 nm was determined using an
Envision 2104 plate reader (PerkinElmer). Data were exported
to GraphPad (Prism) for analysis and ﬁgure composition.
For SRE reporter microinjection assays, cells were maintained in 0.05% (v/v) FCS-supplemented DMEM for at least 14 hours
before treatment or microinjection. In microinjection experiments, SRE-FosHA reporter cells were plated onto glass coverslips before maintenance in starvation medium. Cells nuclei
were microinjected with the indicated expression plasmids
(50 ng/mL). Two hours after injection, cells were exposed to
drug or vehicle (DMSO) for 2 hours before formaldehyde ﬁxation. FosHA expression was detected by indirect immunoﬂuorescence with 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA and donkey Texas
Red anti-mouse (Jackson). Immunoblots were run on 4% to 20%
Tris–glycine gels (Invitrogen), transferred to a 0.45-mm polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (PVDF; Invitrogen), and were
blocked and probed in 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). Rabbit anti-Egr1
was purchased from Transduction Laboratories.
Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assays to monitor DNA synthesis were as described (26). In short, cells were

incubated with BrdUrd for the indicated times before ﬁxation
in 5% (v/v) acetic acid in ethanol or with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in cells expressing EGFP-DAD fusion proteins (17).
BrdUrd was identiﬁed by indirect immunoﬂuorescence with
monoclonal anti-BrdUrd (GE Healthcare) followed by Texas
Red–conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch). DNA (nuclei) content was detected with Hoechst
33258 (included in the secondary step). BrdUrd positivity was
determined from two to three separate experiments in which
20–30 BrdUrd-labelled nuclei were counted in three different
ﬁelds.
Flow cytometry
Cells were treated with IMMs, DMSO (vehicle), or Taxol,
detached in 10 mmol/L EDTA in PBS, and washed twice in
Annexin-staining buffer (0.01 mol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.14 mol/L
NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2). Cells were resuspended in Annexinstaining buffer with Annexin-V–FITC (as directed by the
manufacturer). Ten thousand events were acquired on FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson), and data were analyzed in the B-D
CellQuest software.
Tumor xenograft models and in vivo drug efﬁcacy
evaluation
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Van Andel Research Institute approved all animal studies.
Athymic nude female mice 6 to 8 weeks of age were used. For
xenograft tumors, subconﬂuent cells were harvested and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline at 2.5 to 10  106 cells/mL.
Each animal received a subcutaneous injection of 100 mL of
resuspended cells into the right ﬂank. Animal weight and
tumor volume were monitored 3 times a week. Tumor dimensions were measured manually with calipers; tumor volume
was calculated by volume (mm3) ¼ length  width  depth.
When the tumor reached approximately 250 mm3, mice
were randomly assigned into treatment groups (10 mice/
group): vehicle, IMM-01 (5 mg/kg), IMM-01 (25 mg/kg),
IMM-02 (5 mg/kg), or IMM-02 (25 mg/kg). Injections were
intratumoral, intraperitoneal, or intravenous administered
twice a week (unless otherwise indicated) until tumor volume
reached 2,500 mm3. Tumors were excised, formalin-ﬁxed, and
parafﬁn-embedded. Sections (5 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using the Ventana SYMPHONY
(Roche) and imaged with a 63 oil-immersion objective on
a Nikon microscope.

Results
By exploiting our working knowledge of formin autoregulation (12, 17), we hypothesized that disrupting DID–DAD
binding (shown schematically in Fig. 1A) would activate the
mDia family of formins in cells. We adapted a ﬂuorescence
anisotropy assay (14) to a high-throughput format to test
whether unlabeled DAD peptide competes with FITC-DAD
(Fig. 1B). The resulting IC50 values (250 nmol/L) were consistent with those determined for both mDia1 or mDia2 DID
and DAD (16, 17).
We screened 10,000 drug-like compounds from a representative chemical library (see Materials and Methods). The

www.aacrjournals.org

library was developed using methods of chemotypic coverage
to select a chemically diverse compound set (18). The compounds were screened at a single concentration, and then
active compounds were retested at multiple concentrations
to identify dose-dependent inhibitors. Two structurally
related carbothioamides with IC50 values less than 150
nmol/L were identiﬁed (Fig. 1C, inset): N1-(tert-butyl)-2-(2,4dihydroxybenzylidene)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (IMM-01)
and N1-(tert-butyl)-2-[1-(3,5-diﬂuoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethylidene]hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (IMM-02). IMM-01 and
-02 inhibited DID–DAD binding with IC50 values of 140 and
99 nmol/L (Hill slope values of 0.75 and 0.76), respectively
(Fig. 1C). A third structurally related molecule (Fig. 1C, inset),
N1-(tert-pentyl)-2-[2-(tert-butylthio)benzylidene]hydrazine-1carbothioamide), did not have activity in the assay. Other
carbothioamides are currently in clinical trials as anticancer
agents (27), suggesting the IMMs might be bioavailable and,
therefore, could be developed for use in the clinic.
In silico docking (16) of IMM-01 and -02 into the mDia1 DID
structure (28, 19) suggested that these molecules occupy the
space within the armadillo-repeat region (ARR; ref. 29) normally occupied by DAD (Fig. 1D and E). The two intramimics
bind in similar but distinct orientations that could contribute
to differential binding afﬁnity and physiologic activity. The
inactive IMM-03 (Fig. 1D, shown in red) did not align into the
DAD pocket.
To examine IMM effects on cytoskeletal dynamics, NIH
3T3 cells previously maintained in low serum were used.
Using ﬂuorescent phalloidin to monitor F-actin and antibodies speciﬁc for stabilized, detyrosinated tubulin (24), we
observed that IMM-01 induced ﬁlopodia-like structures
similar to those observed in cells expressing constitutively
active mDia1 or mDia2 (17, 30). Likewise, we observed
microtubule stabilization consistent with formin activation
in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2A–C; refs. 11, 31, 32). Microtubule
stabilization was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting of NIH 3T3
whole-cell lysates (Fig. 2D). To test the impact on a Taxolsensitive transformed tumor cell line, SW480 colon carcinoma cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of
IMM-01 or -02. Exposure to 100 mmol/L IMM-01 for 1 hour
induced microtubule stabilization at levels similar to those
induced by Taxol (Fig. 2E); IMM-02 showed an equivocal
effect. The difference in induction of stabilization between
treated and untreated NIH 3T3 and SW480 cells is unclear; it
may reﬂect fundamental differences in dynamic instability of
transformed and nontransformed cells (31, 33), or alternatively, the nature of the affected target formin expressed in
these two different cell types (34).
Rho GTPase/formin signaling is known to induce new
gene expression via the MAL–SRF transcription factor axis
that relates changes in actin dynamics (35). To test for SRF
activation, we used untransformed NIH 3T3 reporter cell
lines stably expressing SRF-sensitive SRE–controlled reporter genes (SRE-LacZ or SRE-FosHA reporter; ref. 21). Cells
were exposed to agents for 2 hours before ﬁxation and assay
(Fig. 3A–C). FCS stimulation (15%) and 1 mmol/L cytoD were
used as positive controls for sensitivity to actin dynamics;
(cytoD impairs actin monomer binding to MAL, releasing

positive and negative controls, respectively, for activation of
formins (Fig. 3C; ref. 12). FH2DN blocked IMM- and DADinduced activation of SRF, showing that SRF activation by
IMMs relied on activation of cellular formins.
We interrogated expression of a cellular SRF target, Egr1
(39), in serum-deprived SW480 cells exposed to IMM-01 or
-02. Egr1 expression was monitored by indirect immunoﬂuorescence. Consistent with SRF activation, both IMMs
induced Egr1 expression as detected by indirect immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 4A) or immunoblotting of whole-cell
lysates (Fig. 4B). Concurrent with Egr1 induction, F-actin
architecture was altered by IMMs relative to treatment with
vehicle, serum, or cytoD. Treatment with 10 mmol/L IMM
modestly increased F-actin content. F-actin accumulated at
cell–cell junctions in cells treated with IMM-02, suggesting
that formin activation reinforced those junctions. Whether

this is due to direct induction of formin-mediated actin
assembly or due to indirect induction of cell-structure genes
is a topic of further investigation.
To study effects on cell-cycle progression, NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were exposed to IMMs, and G1–S progression was
assayed by BrdUrd incorporation and indirect immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 5). Cells were maintained in low concentration
serum (0.05% FCS) for 16 hours to induce G0 arrest before
serum stimulation; BrdUrd and 30 mmol/L of either IMM-01 or
-02 were added simultaneously at t ¼ 0 (Fig. 5A, black bars). In a
parallel positive-control experiment, plasmids expressing
either EGFP-DAD or inactive EGFP-DAD-M1041A were microinjected into cell nuclei 2 hours before serum stimulation and
addition of BrdUrd.

Figure 4. Egr1 expression is induced in colon carcinoma cells by IMM treatment. SW480 cells were treated with vehicle, 15% FCS, 1 mmol/L cytoD, or

had no effect. To ensure that IMMs were not affecting the
cellular uptake of BrdUrd or inhibiting DNA synthesis per se,
IMMs were added 10 hours after serum stimulation, and the
cells were ﬁxed and analyzed 16 hours poststimulation for
BrdUrd-positive nuclei (Fig. 5A, gray bars). These data
showed that, in nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells, the ability
to affect progression into DNA synthesis occurred in the G1
phase.
To compare these results with those from tumor cells,
SW480 colon carcinoma cells maintained in serum were
exposed to IMM-01 for 22 hours; these cells do not uniformly
arrest in G0 in low concentration serum. Unlike the nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells, there was little or no effect on BrdUrd
incorporation (Fig. 5B). However, most cells became binucleate
or multinucleate compared with cells exposed to vehicle. This
result was consistent with persistent activation of formins by
EGFP-DAD during later stages of the cell cycle prior to cytokinesis in NIH 3T3 cells (40).
We then returned to nontransformed NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts
and tested whether exposure to IMMs 16 hours after serum
stimulation affected progression through G2 into mitosis and
cytokinesis. Neither IMM (30 mmol/L) induced the expected
binucleation in cells ﬁxed and examined 24 hours after serum
stimulation: the cells failed to divide, remained mononucleate,
and took on the appearance shown in Fig. 2. The defect is likely

www.aacrjournals.org

from the loss of cytoskeletal dynamics due to inappropriate
formin activation in the G2 phase before breakdown of the
nuclear envelope. The speciﬁc impact on progression through
G2 and mitosis is a topic of ongoing study. We then evaluated
the impact of IMMs on cell survival by monitoring markers of
programmed cell death.
First, we examined the effect of either IMM-01 or -02 on
caspase-3 cleavage during induction of apoptosis in NIH
3T3 cells and SW480 cells, relative to Taxol or doxorubicin
as positive controls (Fig. 6). In NIH 3T3 cells, 100 mmol/L
of either IMM-01 or -02 induced caspase-3 cleavage at
levels similar to those of the positive controls (Fig. 6A, top
row).
SW480 cells have high intrinsic or steady-state levels of
caspase activity (Fig. 6A, bottom row, DMSO). At the most
effective (100 mmol/L) concentration, it was difﬁcult to detect
cleaved caspase-3 because the cells detached from the tissue
culture dish as they underwent apoptosis. To conﬁrm apoptosis in all SW480 cells, including the nonadherent cells, all
cells were harvested and stained with ﬂuorescent Annexin-V
to measure the exposure of membrane phosphatidylserine
that occurs during the apoptotic process (Fig. 6B). The
percentage of Annexin-V–positive cells for both IMMs at
100 mmol/L was similar to, if not greater than, the effects

Discussion
In this study, IMMs slowed tumor growth in an SW480
xenograft model, completely eliminating the tumor burden in a
small number of animals. We suggest that relative to Taxol,
IMMs would produce fewer deleterious side effects in the
treatment of solid tumors and myeloid-derived cancers
because they do not directly bind tubulin. Instead, they affect
a component of the machinery, the formins, responsible for
coordinating actin and microtubule dynamics (1). Further, it is

on growth and survival in nontransformed and transformed
cells was clearly different. Future studies will address the
mechanism of the cell-cycle block and determine tumor cell
types sensitive to IMMs.
To test IMMs for antitumor effects in vivo, athymic nude
mice were implanted with SW480 cells and treated with IMM
or vehicle. IMMs slowed tumor growth in a dose-dependent
manner when administered intravenously via the tail vein
(Fig. 7). Intravenous IMM-01 at 5 mg/kg slowed the growth
of three of 11 (27%) tumors and, at 25 mg/kg, of three of four
(75%) tumors. H&E staining suggested that IMM-01 treatment
disrupted the growth and organization of viable tumor cells
(Fig. 7B). Results varied with IMM-01 administered via intratumoral or intraperitoneal injection. Interestingly, IMM-01 was

xenografts. A, SW480 tumors were treated 2 (or 5) times a week via
intravenous tail vein, intraperitoneal, or intratumoral injections of IMMs

(5 or 25 mg/kg). Treatment began when tumors reached 100 mm
(time ¼ 0 week). Tumors that decreased in volume or slowed growth to
more than 2 times the SD of the average size of vehicle-treated tumors
were designated as responders. Tumor growth was normalized to
pretreatment sizes. Tumor size and growth exhibited a high degree of
variability. Intravenous injections of the IMMs slowed tumor growth in a
subset of tumors (data not shown for intraperitoneal or intratumoral
injections). IMM-01 at a dose of 25 mg/kg modestly suppressed tumor
growth relative to vehicle treatment. Inset box-whisker plot shows
normalized tumor volume for all tumors after 3 weeks of treatment;

dissect the differences in how formins contribute to the
cytoskeletal remodeling machinery between neoplastic and
normal cells. These differences in response may be dictated by
genetic and epigenetic differences in Rho and formin expression and activity, or by differences in the expression of cellular
collaborators that participate in actin or microﬁlament
dynamics, or by a combination of both. Signaling molecules
that interact with formins as collaborators include Src and the
adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene product
APC (30, 31). APC participates in canonical Wnt signaling to
the growth control machinery and collaborates with mDia1
and mDia2 to inﬂuence microtubule dynamics (43). APC has
recently been shown to collaborate with mDia1 in actin
nucleation (44), in a likely conserved relationship (45). In
addition, mDia2 interacts with HDAC6 and, therefore, may
affect microtubule dynamics through regulated tubulin acetylation (46).
At the clinical level, such a disparity suggests therapeutic
beneﬁt through IMMs targeting diseased cells while protecting
normal tissue. This study points to efﬁcacy in solid tumors, but
preliminary evidence suggests a wider application.
We are actively pursuing the efﬁcacy of these compounds
in models of myelodysplasia. Lenalidomide activates Rho
signaling and is highly effective in myelodysplasia patients
bearing defects in the long arm of chromosome 5 (42).
Chromosome 5 harbors several actin assembly proteins,
including the formin mDia1 and the SRF target Egr1
(39). Because formins act as a node in a tumor suppressor
network that induces the expression of PTEN and p53
family tumor suppressor proteins (47), activation of formins
could make tumor cells more sensitive to chemotherapeutic
agents.
Intramimics represent a novel therapeutic strategy, redirecting formin-directed cytoskeletal remodeling in disease
affected by formin dysfunction (3). They will serve as leads
for further therapeutic development. Recently, two independent studies (48, 49) identiﬁed and characterized smallmolecule inhibitors of formins useful for studying formin
function in various cellular contexts. Likewise, intramimics
may be used as pharmacologic probes for studying Rhoformin signaling in other fundamental biologic processes
that rely upon formins to guide the construction of cellular
infrastructure (50). These studies provide the foundation for
interrogating the role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining
regulated cell growth and differentiation.

intriguing to consider IMMs as adjuvant therapy along with
other chemotherapeutic agents that activate Rho signaling,
such as lenalidomide that targets a ubiquitin ligase and activates Rho signaling (41, 42), or farnesyl transferase inhibitors
(6, 9).
One seminal ﬁnding of this study is that IMM action differs
in transformed versus normal cells. Assays comparing cell
cycle, cytokinesis, and apoptosis indicate a clear difference in
the mechanisms available for IMM intervention in transformed
cells. At the molecular level, these ﬁndings provide a tool to
