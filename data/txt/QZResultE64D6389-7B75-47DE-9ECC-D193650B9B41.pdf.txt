ABSTRACT
Induction of senescence by chemotherapy was initially characterized as a
suppressive response that prevents tumor cell proliferation. However, in response
to treatment, it is not really known how cells can survive senescence and how
irreversible this pathway is. In this study, we analyzed cell escape in response to
irinotecan, a first line treatment used in colorectal cancer that induced senescence.
We detected subpopulations of cells that adapted to chemotherapy and resumed
proliferation. Survival led to the emergence of more transformed cells that induced
tumor formation in mice and grew in low adhesion conditions. A significant amount of
viable polyploid cells was also generated following irinotecan failure. Markers such as
lgr5, CD44, CD133 and ALDH were downregulated in persistent clones, indicating that
survival was not associated with an increase in cancer initiating cells. Importantly,
malignant cells which resisted senescence relied on survival pathways induced by Mcl1 signaling and to a lesser extent by Bcl-xL. Depletion of Mcl-1 increased irinotecan
efficiency, induced the death of polyploid cells, prevented cell emergence and inhibited
growth in low-adhesion conditions. We therefore propose that Mcl-1 targeting should
be considered in the future to reduce senescence escape and to improve the treatment
of irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancers.

INTRODUCTION

which is not always the case during the inhibition of cell
cycle progression. In addition, senescence is also viewed
as a consequence of cell cycle arrest that occurs when cells
are overwhelmed at the same time by growth-promoting
pathways and inaproppriate mTOR signaling [7-10].
In response to treatment, it is however unclear if
senescence is always irreversible and why or how some
cells preserve their proliferative potential in response to
this suppressive mechanism. Theoretically, clones can exit
senescence by the acquisition of secondary mutations such
as p53 inactivation, but this is difficult to reconcile with
the absence of proliferation of treated cells. Interestingly,
several studies have reported non mutational mechanisms
of drug resistance. For instance, a small subpopulation of

Conventional genotoxic treatments induce cell death
through apoptosis or senescence, a long term cell cycle
exit where cancer cells remain viable but proliferation
is definitely arrested. This response relies on the p53p21waf1 and p16INK4-Rb pathways that prevent cell
cycle progression and lock E2F-responsive genes in an
inactive stage. Initially characterized in primary cells,
animal models and human biopsies have demonstrated
that senescence limits tumor progression and is necessary
for a chemotherapy response [1-5]. Cell cycle arrest and
senescence should be distinguished [6], first because
senescent cells loose definitely their replicative potential,

RESULTS

«cancer-initiating cells» (CICs) endowed with an intrinsic
drug resistance program represents a major source of
therapeutic failure in breast cancer [11-13]. These initiating
cells exist in a dynamic equilibrium with a differentiated
counterpart, they auto-regenerate and thus reconstitute a
complete population in response to stressful conditions
[14]. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
plays an important role in this phenotypic adaptation
through the conversion of epithelial to mesenchymal
cells endowed with CIC properties [11, 15-17]. In lung
cancer, subpopulations of persistent cells can also resume
proliferation when the majority of the population dies in
response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This has
been associated with an altered chromatin state mediated
by the RBP2/KDM5A/Jarid1A histone demethylase [18].
Such adaptive and reversible mechanisms have also been
described in bacteria where the rate of switching between
sensitive and resistant bacteria explains how a total
population can ultimately be reconstituted when antibiotic
treatment is released [19].
We have recently shown that senescence escape and
persistence also occur in colorectal cancer in response to
the oncogenic stress mediated by Rasv12 [20]. Persistence
was associated with p21waf1 down-regulation, increased
genomic instability and with a dependency on Bcl-xL/
Mcl-1 prosurvival signaling. In the current study, we
pursued these experiments on senescence escape in
response to chemotherapy. In unresectable metastatic
colorectal cancer, irinotecan is used as a first or second line
treatment in the FOLFIRI (leucovorin/5-FU/irinotecan)
regimen. Unfortunately, tumor progression occurs
generally rapidly [21], indicating that some cells can
adapt to this topoisomerase I inhibitor. Several resistance
mechanisms have been described, such as drug transport
and metabolism, enhanced DNA repair and compensatory
feedback pathways [22]. In this study, we described that a
small population of cells can escape senescence and adapt
to irinotecan treatment. Emerging within an heterogeneous
population, persistent cells appeared to be more
transformed and invasive than the parental population
because they acquired the ability to grow in low-adherence
conditions and to proliferate within a matrigel matrix.
Interestingly, these cells show dependence on Mcl-1
signaling, probably as a consequence of pro-apoptotic
pathways activated during senescence resistance.
Therefore, although chemotherapy killed off the
vast majority of the initial population, some cells resist to
this treatment and afterwards emerge as more aggressive
cells. Besides the acquisition of secondary mutations,
we propose that this adaptation mechanism plays an
important role in the response failure of colorectal cancer
to topoisomerase I inhibitors.

To determine whether colorectal cells can tolerate
chemotherapy, three different cell lines were treated with
sn38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. LS174T and
HCT116 cells express a functional p53-p21 signaling
pathway and HT29 cells were used as an example of cells
expressing an inactive form of the p53 tumor suppressor.
Using first clonogenic assays, we observed that
LS174T and HCT116 have equivalent sensitivity to the
topoisomerase inhibitor whereas HT29 cells were slightly
more resistant (Figure 1A). sn38 was then used at 5 ng/
ml because this concentration prevented cell proliferation
of the three cell lines in clonogenic conditions. Note
that pharmacokinetic studies have shown that this also
corresponds to the plasma concentration of sn38 [23].
Using HT29 as a first experimental model, we observed
that cells arrested after two days of treatment with a 4N
DNA content and then entered apoptosis as evidenced
by the presence of subG1 cells and caspase 3 activation
(Figure 1B). This was expected since apoptosis is the main
response to DNA damaging drugs when p53 is inactivated
[24-27]. These experiments were then repeated in HCT116
and LS174T cells that express a functional p53-p21
pathway. As expected, the p21waf1 cell cycle inhibitor
was expressed in both cell lines in response to sn38 and
senescence was induced, as evidenced by standard betagalactosidase assays (Figure 1C). By contrast, caspase 3
or the presence of subG1 cells were not detected in these
conditions (data not shown). We then focused on these two
cell lines.
Although senescence is considered as a definitive
arrest of cell proliferation, how cells escape this
suppressive mechanism in response to chemotherapy has
not been explained in detail. To determine if/how some
cells preserve their proliferative capacities in response to
senescence-inducing treatments, LS174T and HCT116
cells were stimulated with 10% serum after 4 days of
sn38 treatment (see Figure 2A). The ability to proliferate
was then evaluated by clonogenic assays, in untreated
cells, after 4 days of treatment or in surviving cells
(day 11) and representative images are presented Figure
2B. After 11 days, results showed that some LS174T
clones resumed proliferation whereas most HCT116
cells remained essentially arrested at that time (Figure
2B). LS174T clones that emerged from senescence
will be named persistent LS174T cells (PLCs). Visual
microscopic analysis showed that PLCs emerged as a
mixed subpopulation of cells that were either arrested
or proliferating (Figure 2C, see also below Figure 7 for
KI67 staining). Beta-galactosidase staining indicated

that around 70% of PLCs were still senescent, whereas
20-30% of the total population had restarted proliferation
at that time (Figure 2D). Clonogenic tests showed that
PLCs divided less efficiently than parental LS174T cells
(Figure 2E). To extend this observation, PLCs were
injected subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice
and their ability to form tumor was compared to that of
parental LS174T cells. Surprisingly and despite the fact
that PLCs were composed of 70% senescent cells, tumor
formation was equivalent between parental cells and

PLCs (Figure 2F). We then questioned whether we had
selected clones that possessed an intrinsic resistance to the
treatment. Clonogenic tests were performed to compare
the sensitivity of the persistent cells to the parental
LS174T population. Results indicated that PLCs had the
same sn38 IC50 sensitivity as compared to the parental
population (Figure 2G). Note however that differences
in proliferation rate (Figure 2E) and drug sensitivity
(Figure 2G) are difficult to interpret due to the presence of
different populations within the PLCs.

sn38 treatment induced the appearance of cells
that resist to anoikis

Altogether, these results indicate that colorectal
cells respond to topoisomerase I inhibition with different
outcomes, entering either apoptosis or senescence. Among
these, a subpopulation of LS174T cells can survive and
emerge within an heterogeneous subpopulation to resume
proliferation and form tumors in vivo.

We were intrigued by the fact that PLCs induced
in vivo tumor formation to the same extent as parental
cells despite the fact that they were essentially composed
of senescent cells. We therefore determined if sn38

escape induced the emergence of cells that were more
transformed and aggressive than parental cells. Using
serine 139 phosphorylation of histone gamma-H2Ax as
a marker of DNA double strand breaks, we observed by
flow cytometry that sn38 induced DNA damage after two
days as expected (Figure 3A). H2Ax phosphorylation
returned to basal levels in PLCs, suggesting that DNA
repair occurred efficiently. However, a significant amount
of polyploid LS174T cells was detected after two days
(Figure 3B), and these cells remained viable since they
were detected after 4 days and in the PLCs (Figure 3C).
To determine if these abnormal cells were dividing,
clonogenic assays were performed using PLCs and DNA
content was analyzed by FACS at the end of the assay
(see Figure 3D). Cells with polyploid DNA were not
detected at the end of the clonogenic tests, indicating
that these cells are probably growth arrested within the
heterogeneous PLC population (Figure 3D).
We then used growth in soft agar as an indicator of
anoikis resistance and increased cell transformation. To
this end, cells were grown in 3% FBS for four days in the
presence or absence of sn38, cells were then trypsinized,
transferred to soft agar and further grown for 10-20 days.
We observed in this condition that the survival of parental
LS174T cells was significantly reduced (see materials
and methods). By contrast, a subpopulation of sn38treated cells was able to grow in soft agar after 4 days of
treatment (Figure 3E). PLCs were also able to survive in
these low-adhesion conditions. Since the same number of
cells were plated in soft agar as compared to parental cells,
this result indicates that abnormal cells were generated
during the early response to sn38 and that they were not
pre-existent. These experiments were then repeated using
a Matrigel matrix where parental LS174T cells were not
able to survive. Again, a subpopulation of cells was able to
proliferate and invade this matrigel matrix during the early
response to sn38 (Figure 3F).
Therefore, we concluded from these results that
following sn38 treatment, a small subpopulation of
LS174T persistent cells emerged as more transformed
cells that were able to grow in low-adhesion conditions.

efficiency of sn38. To verify this hypothesis, we added
salinomycin together with sn38 at the beginning of the
treatment and cell emergence was then evaluated (see
Figure 4A). Surprisingly, results showed that salinomycin
significantly enhanced the number of proliferating PLCs
(Figure 4B) and the number of cells growing in soft agar
(Figure 4C).
We then determined whether salinomycin effectively
reduced the expression of the main proposed markers of
colorectal cancers stem cells, LGR5, CD133, CD44 and
ALDH [30, 31]. Using flow cytometry, a decrease of
CD44high and LGR5 expression was observed in response
to salinomycin. No significant effect was noticed on
CD133 expression and ALDH activity (Figure 4D). We
then analyzed the expression of CD44, LGR5, CD133
and ALDH activity in PLCs. Results presented Figure 4E
indicate that these markers were down-regulated in the
persistent cells.
Altogether, these results indicate that senescence
escape and persistence were not associated with an
increase in cancer initiating cells. In addition, salinomycin,
although known to target breast CICs, presented
unexpected effects in colorectal cells when added with
sn38, by increasing the proportion of cells that were able
to resist and grow in soft agar.

Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL prevented cell death during the
early response to sn38
We have recently proposed that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1
allow resistance to oncogene-induced senescence [20].
To determine if PLCs emergence was associated with
the induction of anti-apoptotic signals, we analyzed the
expression of Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins following
acute treatment or in PLCs. Western blot experiments
showed that Bcl-2 levels decreased but that Bcl-xL was
up-regulated in response to sn38 (Figure 5A). Though we
found in a few experiments that Mcl-1 was slightly induced
by sn38, its expression was generally not significantly
up-regulated. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed
an early induction at the mRNA levels (Figure 5B). To
determine if Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 compensated pro-apoptotic
signals, Bax, Puma, Noxa and Bim levels were evaluated
since they represent the main targets of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1
[32, 33]. Although we were not able to detect any increase
in Bax, Puma and Noxa expressions, a significant upregulation of Bim was observed in PLCs (Figure 5A and
data not shown). These results suggest that pro-apoptotic
signals are active in PLCs and that the titration of Bim by
survival proteins might be necessary during the process of
cell emergence.
We then determined if cell survival relies on the
expression of Bcl-xL and/or Mcl-1 during the acute
response to sn38. To this end, we used ABT-737, a known
inhibitor of the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Cells were

identified drugs such as salinomycin that specifically kill
these initiating cells [28]. Combinatorial therapy targeting
at the same time CICs and differentiated cancer cells are
expected to be more efficient than chemotherapy alone

treated with sn38 for 4 days, in the presence or absence
of ABT-737 for the last 24 hours. As visualized by trypan
blue exclusion experiments, LS174T cells were not
sensitive to ABT-737 (Figure 5C). HCT116 cells, used as a
control, demonstrated the efficiency of the Bcl-2 inhibitor
since Bcl-xL was also up-regulated in this cell line (data
not shown). This suggested that Bcl-xL signaling was not
the main survival pathway activated in LS174T cells to
allow early sn38 survival. Mcl-1 was then inactivated by
RNA interference in this cell line and its down-regulation
was verified by western blot analysis (Figure 5D, bottom).
Interestingly, Mcl-1 inhibition increased cell death
following sn38 treatment as evidenced by the presence of
subG1 cells (Figure 5D, top). In addition, this also led to
a reduced number of polyploid cells (Figure 5D, middle),
suggesting that cells with abnormal DNA content relied
on Mcl-1 signaling.
It has been recently shown that the up-regulation of
Mcl-1 induced ABT737 resistance [34]. For this reason,
we determined if we could enhance cell death by targeting
both survival proteins simultaneously. To this end, Mcl1 was inactivated by RNA interference, and cells were
treated with sn38 for 3 days, in the presence or absence
of ABT737 for an additional 24 hrs. As visualized by
trypan blue exclusion and the analysis of subG1 cells,
Mcl-1 inactivation induced cell death and this effect was
enhanced by ABT737 to kill almost all cells (Figure 5E).
Interestingly, the combination also enhanced the death of
polyploid cells as compared to the inactivation of Mcl-1
only (Figure 5E, bottom).
Altogether, these results indicate that Mcl-1 and
Bcl-xL are necessary to allow the survival of normal and
polyploid cells during the early response to sn38.

Altogether, these results indicate that Mcl-1 and BclxL are necessary to allow PLC emergence and survival in
low adhesion conditions.

Senescent cells present within the PLC grew in
low adhesion
As described above Figure 2C/D, PLCs were
heterogeneous and composed of around 70% senescent
cells and 20-30% of proliferating cells. We therefore
wanted to determine which subpopulation was able to
survive in low adhesion and which cells expressed Mcl1 and Bcl-xL. Senescent cells are known to increase in
size and density as compared to normal counterparts [35].
Using flow cytometry analysis, we effectively detected
increased cell size (forward scatter, FSC) and granularity
(side scatter, SSC) in PLCs as compared to normal
LS174T cells (Figure 7A). In addition, using FSC/SSC
gating and KI-67 staining as a marker of cell proliferation,
we noticed that a high FSC/SSC profile was associated
with a significant decrease in KI-67 expression (Figure
7B). This suggested to us that this large subpopulation
might contain the senescent cells. To test this hypothesis,
PLC were sorted according to cell size and granularity
and senescence was analyzed on each subpopulation
using beta-galactosidase assays. Results presented Figure
7C indicated that 75,9%+/-8,8 cells with a high FSC/SSC
profile stained positively for beta-galactosidase, whereas
only 13,3%+/-10,2 cells with a low size and granularity
were positive. Using RT-QPCR experiments, we also
noticed that the former subpopulation overexpressed
p21waf1 mRNA as compared to cells that had a lower
FSC/SSC profile. On the opposite, these smaller nonsenescent cells expressed higher level of Aurora-A and
polo-like kinase 1 mRNAs, two mitotic kinases that we
and other have shown to be downregulated in response to
genotoxic treatments (Figure 7D) [36, 37]. Following cell
sorting, clonogenic tests were then performed to evaluate
the proliferative capacity of each subpopulation. Results
presented Figure 7E indicated that cells with a low FSC/
SSC profile divided more efficiently as compared to cells
with a higher profile or to PLCs.
Altogether, these results suggest that we could
separate PLCs according to their size and granularity to
obtain enriched populations of senescent and dividing
cells. The PLCs enriched in dividing cells (low FSC/SSC)
will be named PLD whereas those enriched in senescent
cells will be named PLS (high FSC/SSC).
Results presented Figure 3C showed that a
significant amount of polyploid cells were present within
the PLCs. Following cell sorting and DAPI staining, we
observed that the cell cycle profile of PLD was normal
whereas PLS presented an abnormal polyploid DNA
content (Figure 8A). We then compared the growth in soft
agar of the two subpopulations. To this end, PLCs were

Dependency on Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 for anoikis
resistance and PLC emergence
If Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were necessary for the early
survival in response to treatment, we reasoned that
their inactivation should reduce growth in low adhesion
and prevent PLCs emergence. To this end, Mcl-1 was
inactivated by RNA interference and cells were then
stimulated with sn38 in 3% FBS for 4 days. PLC
proliferation was then evaluated as well as the ability to
grow in soft agar. In the same experiments, we also tested
the effect of the combined inactivation of Mcl-1 and BclxL using ABT-737 (see Figure 6A). Clonogenic tests
presented Figure 6B showed that Mcl-1 downregulation
significantly reduced the number of proliferating PLCs.
This effect was enhanced by ABT737, leading to a
further reduction of the number of dividing cells. Mcl-1
inactivation also significantly prevented growth in soft
agar as compared to a control siRNA (Figure 6C). Results
showed that this effect was enhanced by ABT737, almost
completely inhibiting growth in low adhesion (Figure 6C).

enriched subpopulations were transferred to soft agar and
further grown for 10-20 days. In these conditions, PLS
cells were able to grow in soft agar whereas the number of
growing PLD cells was significantly reduced (Figure 8B).
The same observation was made when sorted cells where
grown in matrigel. Whereas PLS proliferated within this
matrix significantly, less PLD clones were able to grow in
these low-adhesion conditions (Figure 8C). We then asked
if PLD and PLS expressed to the same extent Mcl-1 and

Bcl-xL. Using RT-QPCR and western blot experiments
(Figure 8D), we observed that Bcl-xL was overexpressed
in PLS as compared to PLD, both at the mRNA and
protein levels. By contrast, Mcl-1L protein levels were
slightly overexpressed in the PLD subpopulation.
Therefore, we concluded from these results that
the ability to grow in soft agar and in Matrigel is due to
the presence of senescent cells within the PLC emergent
population.

DISCUSSION

feature of the early response to genotoxic treatments, as a
consequence of growth arrest and senescence induction.
Since, anoikis resistance relies on Erk up-regulation and
Bim inactivation, it will be interesting to determine the
role of the Erk pathway during the escape to sn38.
We also observed that PLCs emerged as an
heterogeneous population, composed of dividing (PLD)
and senescent cells (PLS). This leads to the hypothesis
that cells entered cell cycle arrest but that a few clones
exit this suppressive pathway by a phenotypic switch that
reconstitutes a complete dividing and sensitive population.
As stated above, this adaptive mechanism has already
been described in bacteria where so-called persister
bacteria resist antibiotic treatment and reconstitute a full
population which is again sensitive to the same antibiotic
[19]. The manner in which this phenotypic adaptation
occurs remains to be determined but it does not rely on
any genetic change. Interestingly, this mechanism has been
described recently in lung cancer, showing that equivalent
persistent cells exist in human cancer and can tolerate
chemotherapy [18]. Other results have reported that breast
cancer stem cells and their differentiated counterparts exist
in a dynamic equilibrium and that the conversion between
the two cell types is regulated by inflammatory cytokines
[14]. Further experiments are therefore necessary to
clarify the interactions between the PLS and PLD and
the relations between the subpopulations. It has been
previously reported that senescent cells can stimulate
cancer cell growth and invasion through a secretory
phenotype and the production of matrix metalloproteinases
[35]. In line with these observations, our results indicate
that PLS grew in low adhesion conditions whereas this
was not the case of the dividing subpopulation. It is
tempting to speculate that PLS, through the production
of an «invasive» secretome, provide a surviving niche
where PLD cells could divide. Future experiments are

Colorectal tumors generally fail to respond to
irinotecan within 8-9 months of treatment, indicating that
some cancer cells adapt to this genotoxic drug [21]. We
have previously described that Myc signaling and DNA
repair pathways play an important role in chemotherapy
resistance, notably when deregulated by the STAT3
oncogene [24, 36, 38, 39]. We now extend these results,
showing that a small fraction of LS174T cells can tolerate
this treatment, escape senescence and emerge as a dividing
population. This adaptation was reversible since persistent
cells regained drug sensitivity. In addition, cells with
abnormal polyploid DNA content were present within
the PLC population. Most importantly, PLCs were able
to grow in low adhesion conditions and to proliferate
within a matrigel matrix. Thus, although they regained
sn38 sensitivity, these cells evolved to resist anoikis and
become more aggressive. Since oncogenic progression is
associated with an intrinsic drug resistance program [40,
41], a subpopulation of resistant cells already present
before the treatment could be theorically responsible for
senescence resistance and reproliferation. However, we
believe that a selection was unlikely to occur, since the low
proliferation rate during the initial induction of senescence
is not expected to favor mutagenesis and since the final
population switched back to the same sn38 sensitivity.
In addition, growth in low adhesion was observed very
early during the treatment, in the absence of cell division
(Figure 3E/F). Since parental cells did not grow in soft
agar in our experimental conditions (3% FBS), this
further indicates that the selection of a preexisting clone
was unlikely to occur. In mammary epithelial cells, it
has been proposed that cell cycle arrest and p21waf1
overexpression lead to anoikis resistance [42, 43]. This
suggests that growth in low adhesion might be a common

Figure 9: sn38 survival is associated with increased cell transformation and dependency on Mcl-1: an opportunity
for new treatments in colorectal cancer. In response to sn38, a small fraction of cells escapes the senescence suppressive arrest
and emerges as an heterogeneous and more transformed population. We speculate that these cells are responsible of treatment failure and
disease relapse. Since surviving cells depend on Mcl-1 signaling (and to a lesser extent on Bcl-xL), we propose that inhibitors of the Bcl2
family should be used to improve irinotecan efficiency in the treatment of colorectal cancers.

necessary to determine if a cooperation between these
two subpopulations is necessary to sustain an invasive
phenotype.
These adaptations illustrate the importance of
tumor heterogeneity in treatment failure [44]. Although
targeted therapies can reduce the activity of a deregulated
oncogene, much less is known on how we could prevent
the emergence of heterogeneous persistent cells in
response to treatment. Future experiments should identify
synthetically lethal drugs that could target specific
subpopulations and allow a complete eradication of
cancer cells when used in combination with irinotecan.
The survival of resistant populations has been correlated
with rescue pathways, such as the Met and IGFR receptors
or secreted proteins of the Wnt and Hedgehog family [15,
45]. Since anti-EGFR targeted therapies such as cetuximab
and panitunumab improve tumor response when used in
combination with irinotecan in colorectal cancer [46, 47],
it will be interesting to determine the effect of the EGF
pathway and of these antibodies on PLCs emergence.
In light of our results, we also propose the hypothesis
that inhibitors of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL should be tested in
combination with irinotecan to prevent cell emergence
(Figure 9). Phase I and phase II trials have already enrolled
patients suffering from lymphoid malignancies or smallcell lung cancers to test the efficiency of BH3 mimetics
such as ABT-263 or ABT-199 [32]. Inhibitors of Mcl-1
have been recently described but direct and non toxic
molecules have yet to be tested in clinic [48]. We therefore
propose the hypothesis that these inhibitors should be
used in combination therapy to prevent emergence and
reduce the occurrence of irinotecan-refractory colorectal
carcinomas.

RNA interference experiments were performed
by transfection of 50 nM of prevalidated siRNA
against Mcl-1 (Ambion AM51331 (ID:120642)
or Cell signaling 6315), or control siRNA (MWG
5’-GCACUAACUACCGUGAUUATT-3’
and
5’-GAAAGAAGCACUCGUAUAATT-3’)
using
DharmaFect-4 (Dharmacon), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Clonogenic Assay
Assays were performed in control or treated cells
as well as in PLCs to evaluate proliferation and survival.
500 to 1500 cells were seeded into 6-well cell culture
plates with 10% FBS and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere for 7 to 10 days, then washed twice with PBS,
and stained with 0.4% crystal violet. The colonies were
then washed twice with water, visualized with a BioRad Chemi Doc XRS Imaging device and counted using
Quantity One imaging software (Bio-Rad).

Soft Agar / ECM gel Assay
Cell preparation is a very sensitive step. Cells were
plated the first day in 3% FBS and treated or not with sn38
after 24hr. Four days later, adherent cells were removed
with trypsin for 10 minutes and resuspended in 10% FBS
culture medium. If grown and treated in 10% FBS during
these 5 days, note that parental LS174T cells grew in
soft agar, whereas this was not the case in 3% FBS. After
centrifugation, cells pellet was suspended with 10% FBS
culture medium and KOVA slides (Hycor) were used for
cell count. For each samples, a minimum of three counts
were carried out using three different slides chambers.
The average of these three counts was used to calculate
the volume of cell suspension to obtain a 1.106 cells/mL
solution, in 100µL of 10% FBS culture medium. 5µL
or 10µL of this, containing 5 000 or 10 000 cells, was
transferred to 1,5mL tube. These cells were suspended in
100 µl of preheated agarose and then seeded on the lids of
agar-coated 96-well plates. The base agar layer contained
50 µl of 1% agarose (Invitrogen) in 10% FBS culture
medium with Penicillin-Streptomycin (Lonza). The 100 µl
top agarose solution, containing the cells, was composed
of 0,35% low melting point agarose (Promega) in 10%
FBS culture medium with antibiotics. From one to three
weeks after incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2, cell clones
were counted and images were made. Every sample was
tested in three technical replicates. Representative pictures
were shown and the average of these three replicates was
used for the clones count. For growth in ECM gel, the top
agarose solution was substituted by half diluted ECM gel

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and treatment emergence
Colorectal cell lines (American Type Culture
Collection) were maintained in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640
medium (Lonza), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and maintained at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide.
Cells were routinely tested for the absence of mycoplasma
contamination. Unless indicated, note that cell treatments
were performed in 3% FBS. For persistent cell generation,
cells were treated for the indicated times with sn38 (5ng/
ml; Tocris Bioscience 2684) in 3% FBS, washed with PBS
and then restimulated with fresh 10% FBS. Proliferation
generally resumed after 3-5 days. Other treatments were
used : Salinomycin (1 or 5µM; Sigma Aldrich S6201) and
ABT737 (1µM; Selleckchem S1002).
