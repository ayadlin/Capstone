TCGA Cancers and Candidate Immune Checkpoint
Inhibitor Responses

Abstract
Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment represents a promising approach toward treating cancer and has been shown to
be effective in a subset of melanoma, non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and kidney cancers. Recent studies have
suggested that the number of nonsynonymous mutations
(NsM) can be used to select melanoma and NSCLC patients
most likely to beneﬁt from checkpoint inhibitor treatment. It is
hypothesized that a higher burden of NsM generates novel
epitopes and gene products, detected by the immune system as
foreign. We conducted an assessment of NsM across 7,757
tumor samples drawn from 26 cancers sequenced in the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project to estimate the subset of cancers
(both types and fractions thereof) that ﬁt the proﬁle suggested
for melanoma and NSCLC. An additional independent set of

613 tumors drawn from 5 cancers were analyzed for replication.
An analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curves of
published data on checkpoint inhibitor response in melanoma
and NSCLC data estimates a cutoff of 192 NsM with 74%
sensitivity and 59.3% speciﬁcity to discriminate potential clinical beneﬁt. Across the 7,757 samples of TCGA, 16.2% displayed an NsM count that exceeded the threshold of 192. It is
notable that more than 30% of bladder, colon, gastric, and
endometrial cancers have NsM counts above 192, which was
also conﬁrmed in melanoma and NSCLC. Our data could
inform the prioritization of tumor types (and subtypes) for
possible clinical trials to investigate further indications for
effective use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly in
adult cancers. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3767–72. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

to identify possible predictive signatures; these have included
studies of gene expression signature associated with immune
inﬁltration (14), neoantigen load (15–17), NRAS mutation status
(18), and neoantigen-derived tetrapeptide signature (15). Of
these, the neoantigen load is most promising, particularly for
treatment of melanoma (15, 16) and NSCLC (17).
Nonsynonymous somatic mutations can generate neoantigens
(19–22), which, in turn, can be recognized by the immune system,
triggering an anticancer immune response (23). It has been
observed that a higher number of nonsynonymous mutations
(NsM) correlates with a response to checkpoint inhibitors in
melanoma (15, 16) and NSCLC (17). Here, we conducted an
analysis of the NsM load across the 7,757 tumor samples drawn
from 26 distinct cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA;
ref. 24), to infer possible cancers that might be prioritized for
subsequent study of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The concept of mobilizing the immune system for cancer
treatment was postulated more than 100 years ago, primarily
based on anecdotal reports of regression of aggressive cancers in
response to coinfection (1). Recently, a new generation of
immune therapeutics based on immune checkpoint inhibition,
including anti–CTLA-4 (2), anti–PD-1 (3), and anti–PD1-L1 (4),
has emerged as a promising development in the treatment of
select cancers. In phase III clinical trials, immune checkpoint
inhibitors have been shown to have improved overall survival
in melanoma (5–8), non–small cell lung (NSCLC; refs. 9, 10) and
kidney cancers (11), compared with the standard treatment. Longterm survival of a subset of patients has been reported, and
ongoing studies are intended to conﬁrm and possibly extend
these exciting observations (12, 13). The ability to identify the
subset of long-term survivors could have an important impact on
treatment options, including ﬁrst-line as well as salvage therapy.
Previously, a series of studies have examined somatic alterations

hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous
cell carcinoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, prostate adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous
melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, testicular germ cell
tumors, thyroid carcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, and uveal melanoma. Clinical data
for these tumors were downloaded from the TCGA data portal
(https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/; ref. 24) at the same time.
For the replication set, we downloaded data from seven studies
(117 breast, 78 head and neck, 169 lung adenocarcinoma, 118
melanoma, and 131 prostate cancer patients; refs. 27–33) from
TumorPortal (http://www.tumorportal.org/, March 9, 2016;
ref. 34). These data had been processed through the same analysis
pipeline used for the TCGA set.
A literature search was performed in the PubMed database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed, October 20, 2015)
using combinations of the search terms: cancer, response, mutation, checkpoint inhibitor, CTLA4, and PD1. Studies investigating
immune checkpoint response and with published data on NsM
count, information on immune checkpoint inhibitors response,
and number of NsM were extracted for analysis. We found three
eligible studies: two from previous melanoma (15, 16) and one
NSCLC (17) study.
A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to investigate
the relationship between the number of NsM and response to
immune checkpoint inhibition for the three previous studies
(15–17). GAM tries to ﬁt a generalized linear model (such as the
linear regression model and logistic regression model) with its
predictors deﬁned by some smooth functions of independent
variables. This was chosen because it is ﬂexible to model the effect
of the number of NsM on the response, especially when the effect is
a nonlinear function of the number of NsM. In addition, receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine
the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and speciﬁcity for our
analyses. A proposed threshold was determined to be the point
closest to a true positive rate (sensitivity) of 1 and a false positive rate
(1speciﬁcity) of 0 on the ROC curve of previous clinical studies
(15–17), and thus providing the optimal combination of sensitivity and speciﬁcity. This point was calculated as the maximum
sum of the sensitivity and 1speciﬁcity along the ROC curve. The
best NsM threshold was a cutoff for classifying the samples regarding potential clinical beneﬁt for checkpoint inhibitor response.
To compare the number of NsM for TCGA tumor sets with
respect to reported staging (stage I and II vs. stage III and IV
patients) and smoking status (smoking vs. nonsmoking patients),
we used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, as it is a nonparametric
test to compare the distributions between samples. In order to
address the question if stage and smoking could change the
number of patients classiﬁed with or without potential clinical
beneﬁt for checkpoint inhibitor response, we used the Fisher exact
test. The Fisher exact test was also used for comparing previous
NSCLC and melanoma studies of checkpoint inhibition response
regarding an estimated ROC analysis threshold; it was also
employed for the comparison of the TCGA to replication sets.
All statistical analyses were done within the R program (v3.0.1).

Results
To estimate the fraction of cases in TCGA by tumor type that
could possibly beneﬁt from immune checkpoint inhibition,

3768 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

we analyzed the data with respect to a generalized additive model
that relates response for checkpoint inhibitor to the number of
NsM on data from three previous studies (15–17). Our model
suggests that the clinical response increases until 258 NsM,
at which point there is an observed plateau for the response rate
(Fig. 1A). The ROC analysis based on these data suggests that 192
NsM is the closer point to the true positive rate (sensitivity) of
1 and false positive rate (1speciﬁcity) of 0, and, therefore, could
be a working threshold that optimizes sensitivity (74%) and
speciﬁcity (59.3%; Fig. 1B). Note that 54.2% (57 of 105) of the
patients from the three studies with 192 NsM responded to
checkpoint inhibition treatment, whereas 22.2% with less than
192 NsM (20 of 90) showed a favorable response (P ¼ 4.8  106;
Supplementary Table S1). Although the data from the NSCLC
study indicate a more favorable effect, namely, better area
under the curve (AUC) in the ROC analysis (Fig. 1B), similar
cutoffs were observed for melanoma (cutoff ¼ 192) and NSCLC
(cutoff ¼ 198) in tumor-speciﬁc ROC analyses, suggesting similar
parameters inﬂuence response to immunotherapy.
To investigate the landscape of NsM across 26 cancers reported
in TCGA, we applied 192 NsM as a threshold for the 7,757 TCGA
samples from 26 different tumor types (Fig. 2). Across the TCGA
set, 16.2% displayed an NsM count that exceeded 192 and, thus,
could be in a subset more likely to respond to immune checkpoint
inhibitors. For speciﬁc cancer types, we conﬁrmed that the majority of melanoma (68.3%) and lung tumors (squamous cell ¼
60.1%; adenocarcinoma ¼ 47.6%) have NsM greater than 192.
We also noted that four additional cancers have at least 30% of
tumors with an NsM count greater than 192, namely bladder
(43%), colon (41.1%), gastric (31.1%), and endometrial
(31.5%). We suggest these cancers could be prioritized for
immune checkpoint inhibition studies because a larger fraction
harbors a sufﬁciently high burden of NsM. Not surprisingly, these
tumors are known to be associated with strong environmental
factors and exhibit higher loads of somatic mutations (35).
We replicated these results using independent non-TCGA data
from seven studies (27–33) processed though the same Broad
Firehose pipeline applied to the TCGA data. There were no
signiﬁcant differences observed for melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, head and neck, breast, and prostate cancer between TCGA
and the TumorPortal set, which served as an independent replication set, speciﬁcally regarding the 192 NsM threshold (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S2).
We further evaluated the role of one of the strongest environmental exposures, smoking, in eight TCGA tumor subtypes in
which tobacco use has been implicated as a major risk factor:
bladder urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma, kidney chromophobe, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma,
lung squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
In a preliminary analysis, limited by small numbers for the
nonsmoking subset, both head and neck (P ¼ 3.5  104) and
lung adenocarcinoma (P ¼ 1.7  1016) smoking patients have
more mutations than nonsmoking patients (Supplementary Fig.
S2), but lung adenocarcinoma was the one subtype in which
smoking correlated with a higher NsM (P ¼ 7.8  107; OR ¼
6.62; Fig. 3).
Although clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors have been
conducted in patients with advanced disease, often stage IV,
immunotherapy could have an important role in adjuvant therapy. The assessment of NsM count could provide an opportunity

to investigate stage-related immunotherapy response rates. First,
we compared the number of NsM between stage I and II patients
and stage III and IV patients (Supplementary Fig. S3). After
correction for multiple comparisons, only thyroid cancer stages
III and IV have more NsM than stages I and II (P ¼ 4.1  108),
although this difference is inconsequential since thyroid tumors
do not show NsM loads near the 192 threshold for immunotherapy response. Second, we evaluated if stage could inﬂuence the
number of patients above or below our 192 NsM threshold.
Again, there was no difference in response rate based on
NsM when we compared stages I and II with stages III and IV.
It is important, however, to note that even early stage TCGA
tumor specimens display a bias toward larger tumor size since
the inclusion criteria for TCGA samples is skewed toward
larger samples due to material requirements for genomic
characterization.

Discussion
Data from previous studies of melanoma and NSCLC response
to immune checkpoint inhibitors have suggested a foundation for
developing a strategy to consider stratiﬁcation of cancers based on
the NsM load, primarily because of the observed correlation
between a higher somatic burden and clinical response (15–17).
We applied an empirically derived cutoff of 192 NsM based on
three previous studies to 7,757 TCGA cancer patients across 26
different tumor subtypes, and replicated in 613 cancer patients
across 5 tumor subtypes. In addition to melanoma and lung
cancer, which have data from clinical trials indicating a potential
beneﬁt of immune checkpoint inhibitors, our analysis suggests
bladder, colon, gastric, and endometrial cancers could be high
priorities for future immune checkpoint inhibition studies based
on a higher fraction of tumors (30%) with greater than 192 NsM.

A subset of cancers with a very low fraction (<5%) of tumors with
an NsM above 192 might not be the highest priority for new
studies; these include cancers of the thyroid, ovary, prostate,
kidney, testicle, breast as well as glioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and paragangliomas. Some of these cancers have displayed
few drivers and lower overall burden of mutations (34).
In a comparison of the three published studies, using an ROC
assessment for NsM against the checkpoint response rate, we
observed similar cutoffs when comparing tumor types, but interestingly, the NSCLC study treated with anti–PD-1 had better AUC,
which suggests perhaps better accuracy for NsM to predict immunotherapy response. PD-1 blockade occurs on T cells, which can
attach to tumor cells, whereas CTLA-4 blockade occurs on the
dendritic cell, which presents antigens to the T cell (36). Despite

the fact that the NSCLC study ROC analysis used a small sample
size, it is plausible that NsM may be a better proxy for events
related to blockade closer to the mechanisms of T-cell tumor
attack.
In our assessment of the TCGA melanoma set, 68.3% of
patients could have potential clinical beneﬁt, a rate in agreement
with a 1-year overall survival rate from an anti–PD-1 phase III
clinical trial (65.5% to 78.9%) in melanoma without BRAF
mutation (37). For anti–CTLA-4, plus dacarbazine, the range of
1-year survival is between 41.2% and 53.7% for melanoma
patients (8), which is lower than our analysis predicts; however,
anti–CTLA-4 appears to be less efﬁcacious than anti–PD-1.
Early reports from a phase I clinical trial testing a combination
of anti–PD-1 and anti–CTLA-4 have shown an 82% 1-year overall
survival (38).
The evaluation of lung cancer in TCGA also revealed that 60.1%
of squamous cell patients have an NsM score above the threshold
of 192 and could be more likely to respond to treatment with
checkpoint inhibitors; interestingly, the fraction for adenocarcinoma is 47.6%. In the anti–PD-1 phase III squamous cell lung
cancer clinical trial, the 1-year overall survival rate range was 34%
to 50% (9); the rate for the nonsquamous cell lung cancer phase III
was 45% to 56% 1-year overall survival rate (10). Our analysis
may be overestimating beneﬁt for squamous cell patients due to
the high mutation rate induced by smoking. On the other hand,
smoking adenocarcinoma patients show a higher mutation
burden, which increases the fraction of cases with an NsM above
the 192 threshold. These results correlate with data from lung
cancer clinical trials where smoking patients do show signiﬁcantly
higher response rates to checkpoint inhibitors than nonsmoking
patients (39).
Surprisingly, we did not observe an effect by the stage of the
disease; for instance, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the load
of NsM in stages III and IV compared with stage I and II. This result
could be due to tumor selection bias because TCGA general
guidelines for collecting samples required larger tumors capable
of yielding enough genetic material for analysis. Alternatively,
anti–CTLA-4 is active for adjuvant therapy in melanoma stage III
patients, which suggests that activity is not restricted to stage IV

Possible Checkpoint Inhibitor Response across TCGA Cancers

patients. Although there is not a high level of evidence for action
of checkpoint inhibitors on stages I and II, often early stage
tumors have not accumulated as many NsM. Further studies are
needed to determine if immune checkpoint inhibition therapy is
indicated for earlier stage lung cancer and melanoma.
Currently, only data from clinical trials conducted in melanoma and NSCLC are available to model a threshold for stratiﬁcation of therapy. Our determination of an NsM of 192 is limited by
the sample sizes and studies available. More precise estimates
should emerge from ongoing studies, which could, in turn,
inform our understanding of what may emerge as a more complex
stratiﬁcation model. In our model, clear cell renal cancer could
have a lower response rate to immunotherapy based on NsM
(3.5% of tumors with more than 192 NsM), but a recent clinical
trial showed survival improvement from 19.6 to 25 months for
anti–PD-1 treatment on the second or third line of treatment,
compared with Everolimus (11). On the other hand, 43% of
colon cancer and 10.3% of rectal cancers have more than the 192
NsM. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published phase
III clinical trials from colorectal cancer; however, some studies
suggest that the subset of colorectal cancers with mismatch repair–
deﬁcient would have better immune checkpoint inhibition
response (40, 41). Furthermore, other biomarkers could emerge
that might improve the algorithms for choosing immune checkpoint inhibition, either as a ﬁrst-line or salvage therapy. In turn,
differences in the response rate for immune checkpoint inhibition
therapy could lead to cancer-speciﬁc thresholds, and perhaps
stage variables may also be informative.
In conclusion, we have reported on available somatic tumor
data to develop a stratiﬁcation model in which response rate to
immune checkpoint inhibitors correlates with NsM burden.

Although further validation is needed, we suggest that information on NsM could be useful in selecting tumor types that are most
likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors for future
clinical trials. Clearly, more data are needed to move beyond a
linear threshold for NsM and establish a model with greater
accuracy for developing robust approaches toward precision
medicine for select cancers (42).
