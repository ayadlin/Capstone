Summary
Genetic screens are powerful tools for identifying genes responsible for diverse phenotypes. Here
we describe a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screen in tumor growth and
metastasis. We mutagenized a non-metastatic mouse cancer cell line using a genome-scale library
with 67,405 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). The mutant cell pool rapidly generates metastases
when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Enriched sgRNAs in lung metastases and late
stage primary tumors were found to target a small set of genes, suggesting specific loss-of-

function mutations drive tumor growth and metastasis. Individual sgRNAs and a small pool of 624
sgRNAs targeting the top scoring genes from the primary screen dramatically accelerate
metastasis. In all of these experiments, the effect of mutations on primary tumor growth positively
correlates with the development of metastases. Our study demonstrates Cas9-based screening as a
robust method to systematically assay gene phenotypes in cancer evolution in vivo.

Introduction
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cancer genomes have complex landscapes of mutations and diverse types of genetic
aberrations (Lawrence et al., 2013; Weinberg, 2007). A major challenge in understanding
the cancer genome is to disentangle alterations that are driving the processes of tumor
evolution from passenger mutations (Garraway and Lander, 2013). Primary tumor growth
and metastasis are distinct yet linked processes in the progression of solid tumors (Nguyen
et al., 2009; Valastyan and Weinberg, 2011; Vanharanta and Massague, 2013). It has been
observed in the clinic that the probability of detecting metastases in a patient positively
correlates with the size of a primary tumor (Heimann and Hellman, 1998). Several possible
explanations have been suggested: metastatic properties may only be acquired in late-stage
tumors; larger tumors proportionally seed more cells into circulation that eventually migrate
to other sites; or that cells with a strong ability to proliferate also have enhanced ability to
metastasize (Weinberg, 2007). In early studies using random insertional mutagenesis, it was
observed that metastatic cell subpopulations overgrow to complete dominance in the
primary tumor, suggesting progressive selection at both sites (Korczak et al., 1988;
Waghorne et al., 1988).

Genetic screens are powerful tools for assaying phenotypes and identifying causal genes in
various hallmarks of cancer progression (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). RNA interference
(RNAi), or overexpression of open reading frames (ORFs), have been utilized for screening
cancer genes in several models of oncogenesis in mice (Schramek et al., 2014; Shao et al.,
2014; Zender et al., 2008). Recently, the Cas9 nuclease (Barrangou et al., 2007; Bolotin et
al., 2005; Chylinski et al., 2013; Chylinski et al., 2014; Deltcheva et al., 2011; Garneau et
al., 2010; Gasiunas et al., 2012; Jinek et al., 2012; Sapranauskas et al., 2011) from the
microbial type II CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)
system has been harnessed to facilitate loss-of-function mutations in eukaryotic cells (Cong
et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013). When the Cas9 nuclease is targeted to specific locations in
the genome, DNA cleavage results in double-stranded breaks (DSBs), which are repaired via
non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (Rouet et al., 1994). NHEJ repair results in insertion
or deletion (indel) mutations that can cause loss-of-function if the DSB occurs in a coding
exon. The Cas9 nuclease can be guided to its DNA target by a single guide RNA (sgRNA)
(Jinek et al., 2012), a synthetic fusion between the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA) (Deltcheva et al., 2011). In cells, Cas9-mediated gene
disruption requires the full-length tracrRNA (Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013), in which

secondary structures at the 3′ end of tracrRNA are critical for Cas9-mediated genome
modification (Cong et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2013).
Screens utilizing Cas9 have identified genes that are essential for cell survival and genes
involved in drug resistance in various cell lines (Koike-Yusa et al., 2014; Shalem et al.,
2014; Wang et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014). In vivo pooled screens are challenging due to
many factors, such as the complexity of the library, limitations of virus delivery and/or cell
transplantation, uniformity of viral transduction at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), and
the complex dynamics and interactions of cells in animals. In this study, we report a
genome-wide Cas9 knockout screen in a mouse model of tumor evolution. This screen
provides a systematic phenotypic measurement of loss-of-function mutations in primary
tumor growth and metastasis.

Results
CRISPR/Cas9 library-mediated mutagenesis promotes metastasis
We derived and cloned a cell line (Chen et al., 2014) from a mouse non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) (Kumar et al., 2009). This cell line possesses an oncogenic Kras in
conjunction with homozygous p53 and heterozygous Dicer1 loss of function (KrasG12D/
+;p53−/−;Dicer1+/−, denoted KPD), and is capable of inducing tumors when transplanted
into immunocompromised mice (Chen et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2009). We transduced this
cell line with a lentivirus carrying a Cas9 transgene fused to a green fluorescent protein
(GFP) and generated clonal cell lines (Cas9-GFP KPD) (Experimental Procedures) (Figure
S1 A–B). A clonal Cas9-GFP KPD cell line (clone 5) was selected to provide genetic and
cellular homogeneity for subsequent screens.

We utilized a pooled genome-wide mouse sgRNA library (termed mouse Genome-scale
CRISPR knockout library A, or mGeCKOa) containing 67,405 sgRNAs targeting 20,611
protein-coding genes and 1,175 microRNA precursors in the mouse genome (Sanjana et al.,
2014). The library also contains 1,000 control sgRNAs (termed non-targeting sgRNAs)
designed to have minimal homology to sequences in the mouse genome (Sanjana et al.,
2014; Shalem et al., 2014). We transduced the Cas9-GFP KPD cell line with mGeCKOa
with three independent infection replicates and each replicate with greater than 400x library
coverage (cells per lentiviral CRISPR construct) (Figure 1A) (Experimental Procedures).

Author Manuscript

After in vitro culture for 1 week, we subcutaneously transplanted 3 x 107 cells into the
flanks of immunocompromised Nu/Nu mice (Figure 1A). We transplanted the cells from
each infection replicate into 4 mice, using 1 mouse for early tumor sequencing and 3 mice
for sequencing of late stage primary tumor and metastases (Figure 1A). Both mGeCKOa
transduced and untransduced Cas9-GFP KPD cells formed tumors at the injection site
(Figure 1B). Like most subcutaneously transplanted tumors, these tumors were poorly
differentiated. The primary tumors induced by mGeCKOa transduced cells grew slightly
faster than tumors from the untransduced cells at an early stage (Figure 1C) (two weeks
post-transplantation) (paired two-tailed t-test, p = 0.05), but at late stages all tumors were
similar in size (paired two-tailed t-test, p = 0.18 for data at four weeks, and p = 0.6 for data
at six weeks) (Figure 1C).

At 6 weeks post-transplantation, we imaged the mice using micro-computed tomography
(μCT), and found tumors in the lungs of the mice transplanted with mGeCKOa-transduced
Cas9-GFP KPD cells (mGeCKOa mice), but not in the mice transplanted with untransduced
Cas9-GFP KPD cells (control mice) (Figure 1D, Figure S1 C). Mice were sacrificed and
examined for metastases in various organs. Under a fluorescent stereoscope at 6x
magnification, metastases were visually detected in the lung in 90% (8/9) of the mGeCKOa
mice (Figure S1 D). The mGeCKOa mice on average had 80% of their lung lobes positive
for metastases (Figure 1E). In contrast, none (0/3) of the control mice developed detectable
metastases in the lung (Figure 1E). At this time, metastases were not detected in the liver,
kidney or spleen in either group (Figure 1F). These data indicated that mGeCKOa library
transduction enhanced the ability of the Cas9-GFP KPD cells to form metastases in the lung.
Dynamic evolution of sgRNA library representation during tumor growth and metastasis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To investigate the sgRNA representation through different stages of tumor evolution and to
identify genes where loss-of-function confers a proliferative or metastatic phenotype, we
used deep sequencing to read out the sgRNA representation. At six weeks post
transplantation, we sequenced the late stage primary tumor and three random lobes from the
lung of each of the nine mGeCKOa mice (Figure 1A) (Experimental Procedures). In
parallel, we also sequenced the mGeCKOa input plasmid library, the pre-transplantation
mGeCKOa transduced Cas9-GFP KPD cells (cultured in vitro for 7 days after transduction),
as well as early stage primary tumors (two weeks post transplantation, one mouse from each
infection replicate). In the cell samples, the sgRNA representations showed high
concordance between technical replicates (correlation, ρ = 0.95 on average, n = 3) and
biological infection replicates (correlation, ρ = 0.84 on average, n = 3) (Figure 2A, Figure S2
A, B, E). The sgRNA representation of cell samples highly correlates with the plasmid
representation (correlation, ρ = 0.93 on average, n = 3) (Figure 2A, Figure S2 C, E).
Furthermore, different sgRNAs that target the same gene are correlated in terms of rank
change (correlation, ρ = 0.49 on average, n = 3) (Figure S2 D). Using Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis, we found that the sgRNAs with significantly decreased abundance in cells
compared to plasmid are enriched for genes involved in fundamental cellular processes, such
as ribosomal proteins, translation factors, RNA splicing factors and RNA processing factors,
indicating selection against the loss of these genes after one week in culture (Figure S2 F).

Author Manuscript

To investigate the sgRNA library dynamics in different sample types (plasmid, pretransplantation cells, early primary tumor, late primary tumor, and lung metastases), we
compared the overall distributions of sgRNAs from all samples sequenced. Cell samples
tightly clustered with each other and the plasmid, forming a cell-plasmid clade (Figure 2A,
Figure S2 E). Early primary tumor samples also clustered with each other and then with the
cell-plasmid clade, whereas late tumors and lung metastases clustered together in a distinct
group (Figure 2A, Figure S2 E). The overlap of detected sgRNAs between different pretransplantation infection replicates is over 95% (Figure S3 A). The detected sgRNAs in the
three infection replicates of early tumor samples overlap 63 – 76% with each other (Figure
S3 B). Early primary tumors retained less than half (32 – 49%) of the sgRNAs found in the
transplanted cell populations (Figure 2B–C, Figure S3 C–D). Compared to the cell

populations, sgRNAs whose targets are genes involved in fundamental cellular processes are
further depleted in early tumors (Table S1).
Interestingly, only a small fraction of sgRNAs (less than 4% of all sgRNAs, or less than 8%
of sgRNAs in the early primary tumor of the corresponding replicate) were detected in the
late stage primary tumor samples (Figure 2B–C, Figure S3 C–D). The sgRNA diversity (i.e.
number of different sgRNAs detected) further decreased in samples from lung metastases
(Figure 2B–C, Figure S3 C–D). The lung samples retained ≤ 0.4% of all sgRNAs in the
mGeCKOa library, or ≤ 1.1% of sgRNAs found in the early primary tumor of the
corresponding replicate, with a subset of highly enriched sgRNAs (Figure 2B–C, Figure S3
C–D). The global patterns of sgRNA distributions in different sample types are distinct, as is
evident in the strong shifts in the respective cumulative distribution functions (KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) test, p < 10−15 for all pairwise comparisons) (Figure 2D).

Enriched sgRNAs in primary tumors

Author Manuscript

Late primary tumors retain few sgRNAs (on average 813 ± 264 sgRNAs, n = 9 mice), with
even fewer at high frequencies (4 ± 1 sgRNAs with > 5% of total reads) in each mouse
(Figure 2B–C, Figure S2 C–D, Figure 3A, Figure S4 H). We used three methods to identify
enriched sgRNAs in the late primary tumor: (1) sgRNAs above a certain threshold, (2) top
ranked sgRNAs in the tumor of each mouse, and (3) using the false discovery rate (FDR),
i.e. sgRNAs enriched compared to the distribution of the 1,000 non-targeting sgRNAs. All
three methods generated similar results (Figure S4 A). Taking the results from (3) as an
example, a total of 935 sgRNAs (targeting 909 genes) are enriched over the non-targeting
controls (FDR cutoff = 0.2%) in the late primary tumor of one or more mice (Figure 3B–C).
These sgRNAs are targeting genes highly enriched in apoptosis pathways (Table S2), with
many of them being pro-apoptotic, such as BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid),
Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (Pten), Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a),
and O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (Mgmt), suggesting strong selection for
mutations that inactivate apoptosis in primary tumor cells.

Author Manuscript

We identified 24 candidate genes that were targeted by two or more independent sgRNAs
enriched in late primary tumors (Figure 3B–C). These genes were found to be mutated in
patients in many previously reported cancer sequencing studies curated by cBioPortal
(Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013) (Figure S5 A). For example, in somatic mutations
identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
including adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (TCGA-Network, 2014) and lung squamous cell
carcinoma (LUSC) (TCGA-Network, 2012), 36% (107/407) of the patients have one or
more of these 24 genes mutated (Figure S5 B–C). Several candidates were well-known
tumor suppressors, such as Pten, Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2b (Cdkn2b),
Neurofibromin 2 (Nf2, Merlin), Alpha-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Pdgfra),
and Integrin alpha X (Itgax).
Enriched sgRNAs in metastases
We also sequenced the sgRNA distributions from three lung lobes for each mouse
transplanted with mGeCKOa-transduced Cas9-GFP KPD cells. In each lobe, the sgRNA

representation is dominated by one or a few sgRNAs (Figure 4A, Figure S3 D, Figure S4 I).
In each mouse, the lung sgRNA representation (average of normalized sgRNA
representations from three lobes) is also dominated by a small number of sgRNAs (on
average, 3.4 ± 0.4 sgRNAs with > 5% of total reads) (Figure 4B), suggesting that metastases
were seeded by a small set of cells, which grew to dominance over this time scale. Nontargeting sgRNAs were occasionally detected in the metastases, but never observed at high
frequency (< 0.1% of total reads in any lobe; Figure 2C, Figure 4A–B, Figure S4 I). These
observations are consistent with our finding that untransduced tumors are not metastatic
(Figure 1E), suggesting specific sgRNA-mediated mutations led to metastasis.

Author Manuscript

The sgRNA representations in the lung metastases are similar to those in the late stage
primary tumors in several ways. First, the detected sgRNAs in lung samples significantly
overlap with those in late tumor samples (Chi-square test, p < 10−15) (Figure S3 E). Second,
the number of sgRNAs detected in lung samples correlates, albeit weakly, with the number
of sgRNAs detected in late primary tumor samples (ρ= 0.42, F-test, p = 0.097) (Figure S3
F). Third, the abundance (number of reads) of sgRNAs in the lung positively correlates with
that in the late primary tumors of the same mouse (correlation, ρ = 0.18 on average, F-test, p
< 0.01, n = 9) (Figure S3 G). Fourth, in most mice (8/9), the lung metastasis enriched
sgRNAs also occupy a large fraction of reads in the late primary tumor of the same mouse
(Figure 4C, left panel), significantly larger than a random sampling of the same number of
sgRNAs from the mGeCKOa library (Figure 4C, right panel). These data indicate that
mutants with preferential ability to proliferate in late primary tumors are more likely to
dominate the metastases.

Author Manuscript

The three methods (threshold, rank, or FDR) of finding enriched sgRNAs in the lung
metastases yield similar results (Figure S4 B). Using the non-targeting sgRNA distribution
to set a FDR-based cutoff for enrichment, the enriched sgRNAs in different lobes of the
same mouse overlap with each other by 62% ± 5% (Chi-square test, p < 10−15) (Figure S4
C), while different mice show greater variability while still overlapping significantly (29% ±
3% Chi-square test, p < 10−15) (Figure S4 D). The overlap between sgRNAs in different
biological / infection replicate experiments when pooling enriched sgRNAs from all mice in
the same replicate is 54% (Chi-square test, p < 10−15) (Figure S4 E), suggesting pooling
sgRNAs from mice in the same experiment facilitates the identification of shared hits. These
data suggest that the three independent experiments reproducibly captured a common set of
hits, and provides a picture for in vivo experimental variation between different lobes,
different animals and different infection replicates.

Author Manuscript

We found 147 sgRNAs enriched in more than one lobe, and 105 sgRNAs enriched in the
lung of more than one mouse (Figure 4D–E). These include sgRNAs targeting Nf2, Pten,
Tripartite motif-containing protein 72 (Trim72), Fibrinogen Alpha Chain (Fga), Bid,
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a), Zinc Finger FYVE Domain Containing 28
(Zfyve28), Reproductive homeobox 13 (Rhox13), BRISC and BRCA1 A complex member 1
(Babam1), as well as microRNA genes miR-152 and miR-345. Intriguingly, a few sgRNAs
targeting the Pol II subunits and olfactory receptor are also enriched in the lung, possibly
due to off-target effects or unknown roles of these genes. For most sgRNAs detected in lung
metastases, the relative abundance in metastases is lower than that in the late primary tumor

of the same mouse, with a metastasis-primary ratio (MPR) less than 1 (Figure S4 F), likely
due to more skewed distributions of sgRNAs in the metastases compared to those in the late
primary tumors. A small subset of sgRNAs, however, are more abundant in metastases than
in primary tumors (MPR > 1) in multiple mice (e.g. sgRNAs targeting Nf2, Trim72,
Prostaglandin E Synthase 2 (Ptgse2) or Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2G 2 (Ube2g2))
(Figure 4F).

Author Manuscript

For four genes, Nf2, Pten, Trim72, and Zfyve28, two independent sgRNAs targeting different
regions of the same gene were enriched in lung metastases (Figure 4G). One of the Zfyve28targeting sgRNAs, however, is enriched in only one mouse; whereas Nf2, Pten and Trim72
all have two sgRNAs enriched in multiple mice (Figure 4H). These three genes, several
representative genes with one frequently enriched sgRNA (Cdkn2a, Fga, Cryba4), and the
top two scoring microRNAs (miR-152 and miR-345) were chosen to assay individually for
primary tumor growth and metastases formation.
Validation in vivo using individual sgRNAs

Author Manuscript

For these eight genes (Nf2, Pten, Trim72, Cdkn2a, Fga, Cryba4, miR-152 and miR-345), we
cloned multiple sgRNAs targeting each of them into the lentiGuide-Puro vector, and
transduced them into the Cas9-GFP KPD cell line (Figure 5A) (Experimental Procedures).
As expected, these sgRNAs generated a broad distribution of NHEJ-mediated indels at the
target site when examined three days post-transduction, with a bias toward deletions (Figure
5B). For protein coding genes, the majority (> 80%) of indels are out-of-frame, which
potentially disrupt the protein functions. For miR-152 and miR-345, the sgRNAs generated
mostly deletions (> 90% of indels are deletions, average indel size = −7 bp) (Figure 5B),
overlapping with the loop or mature microRNA sequences in the hairpins, which are
structures required for maturation of microRNAs. For proteins where specific antibodies are
available (Nf2 and Pten), we found that the majority of the protein products were
significantly reduced one week after lentiviral sgRNA infection (Figure S6 A).

Author Manuscript

When these single-sgRNA-transduced cells were transplanted into the flanks of
immunocompromised mice, they all formed tumors in situ. With two mice injected per
sgRNA and three sgRNAs per gene, all genes tested showed increased lung metastasis
formation compared to controls (untransduced and non-targeting sgRNAs), with the most
significant ones being Nf2, Pten and Cdkn2a (Fisher’s exact test, one-tailed, p < 10−3)
(Figure 5C–D). Fga and Trim72 also have effects on metastasis acceleration (Fga: p =
0.001, Trim72: p = 0.046). Cryba4 is not statistically different from controls (p = 0.1). Both
microRNAs targeted significantly increased metastasis (miR-345: p = 0.01, miR-152: p =
0.046). These data suggest that loss-of-function mutations in any of Nf2, Pten, Cdkn2a,
Trim72, Fga, miR345 or miR-152 are sufficient to accelerate the rate of metastasis formation
in this genetic background.
Most genes targeted by single sgRNAs also contributed to accelerated primary tumor growth
compared to controls (Figure 5E). Nf2 and Pten loss-of-function dramatically sped up tumor
growth (KS test, p < 0.001) (Figure 5E); Cdkn2a-, Trim72- and Fga- targeting sgRNAs
slightly accelerate primary tumor growth (KS test, p = 0.003 – 0.01); Cryba4 has a marginal
effect (KS test, p = 0.08); neither miR-152- nor miR-345- targeting sgRNAs promote

primary tumor growth (KS test, p > 0.1). Overall, for the targets we examined using
individual sgRNAs, the number of lobes with lung metastases strongly correlates with the
terminal volume of the late primary tumor (or average primary tumor growth rate)
(correlation, ρ = 0.83, F-test, p < 0.01) (Figure 5F), indicating at a single gene level that
mutant cells with a stronger ability to promote primary tumor growth generate metastases
faster.

Author Manuscript

To analyze blood samples for the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), we designed a
microfluidic device based on the physical size of the Cas9-GFP KPD cells (Figure S6 B–C).
We performed CTC capture with terminal blood samples from mice injected with Cas9-GFP
KPD cells transduced with sgRNAs targeting Nf2, Pten, Trim72, Cdkn2a, miR-152 and
control cells (uninfected or non-targeting sgRNA) (Figure S6 C–D). Mice transplanted with
cells transduced with sgRNAs targeting Nf2, Pten, Trim72, Cdkn2a or miR-152 had a higher
concentration of CTCs as compared to controls (Figure S6 D–G), consistent with the higher
rate of lung metastasis formation.
Competitive dynamics of top hits assessed using an sgRNA minipool

Author Manuscript

To better understand the relative metastatic potential of multiple genes from our genomewide screen, we designed a targeted pooled screen with a smaller library. This small library
(termed validation minipool) contains 524 sgRNAs targeting 53 genes which had highly
enriched sgRNAs in lung metastases in the genome-wide screen (10 sgRNAs per gene for
most genes) plus 100 non-targeting sgRNAs. We also created a size-matched library
containing 624 non-targeting sgRNAs (termed control minipool) (Figure 6A). Lentiviruses
from these two pools were used to transduce the Cas9-GFP KPD cells, which were then
cultured in vitro for one week, and then transplanted into Nu/Nu mice (Figure 6A). Both
validation minipool and control minipool transduced cells induced primary tumor growth at
a similar rate (Figure 6B). However, mice transplanted with validation minipool cells had a
dramatically elevated rate of lung metastasis formation (Figure 6C).

Author Manuscript

We sequenced the validation minipool plasmid library, the transduced cells pretransplantation, as well as the late stage primary tumors and whole lungs of the mice at 5
weeks post-transplantation. The sgRNA representations correlate strongly between technical
replicates of the transduced cell pool, late primary tumor and lung metastases (Figure S7 A,
D). The sgRNA representation in the cell sample strongly correlated with the plasmid
(correlation, ρ = 0.91) (Figure S7 B, D). Almost all (99.4%) sgRNAs were recovered in the
plasmid and the cell population (Figure S7 C). The late primary tumors retained less than
half of the sgRNAs, while the metastases in the whole lung only retained a small fraction (2
– 7%) of all sgRNAs (Figure S7 C). Enriched sgRNAs from lung metastases clustered with
each other and with late primary tumors (Figure S7 D). Similar to the genome-wide library,
in this validation minipool, the plasmid and cell samples had a unimodal distribution of
sgRNAs, whereas the late primary tumors and lung metastases contained a bi-modal
distribution, with the majority of sgRNAs being absent and a small fraction spanning a large
range of non-zero read counts (Figure 6D). Intriguingly, two mice retained relatively high
sgRNA diversity in late primary tumors (Figure 6D), likely due to dormant or slowly
proliferating cells that remained in low numbers during tumor growth. Similar to the

genome-wide library, large shifts in the sgRNA distribution exist between different sample
types (KS test, p < 10−15 for pairwise comparisons between the cell, primary tumor and lung
metastases, p = 0.02 between plasmid and cell) (Figure 6E).

Author Manuscript

In the validation minipool, the sgRNAs detected in the late primary tumors or the lungs of
five different mice significantly overlap with each other (Figure S7 E–F). The late primary
tumors and lung metastases are dominated by a few sgRNAs (Figure 7A, Figure S7 G–I),
suggesting these sgRNAs outcompete others during tumor growth and metastasis. In this
small size validation library, the sgRNA representations are highly correlated between late
primary tumors and lung metastases (correlation, ρ = 0.55 on average, F test, p < 0.01, n = 5)
(Figure 7B). The late primary tumors and lung metastases have dozens of sgRNAs at
moderate to high frequencies (Figure 7B–C). Several genes have multiple independent
sgRNAs that are enriched in the lung over the primary tumor (MPR > 1), such as Nf2 (8
sgRNAs), Pten (4 sgRNAs), Trim72 (3 sgRNAs), Ube2g2 (3 sgRNAs), Ptges2 (2 sgRNAs)
and ATP-dependent DNA Ligase IV (Lig4) (2 sgRNAs) (Figure 7C–D). Two Cdkn2a
sgRNAs were present in both late primary tumors and lung metastases in two mice, but with
MPR < 1. Fga-, Cryba4-, miR-152- or miR-345- targeting sgRNAs were not found at high
frequency in either late primary tumors or lung metastases, which suggests that they are
outcompeted by other loss-of-function mutations (such as Nf2), which agrees with the
relatively reduced metastasis formation of these genes in the individual sgRNA validation.
These results further validate several of the top hits from the primary screen, using either
sgRNA dominance (e.g. Nf2, Pten, Trim72) or MPR (e.g. Nf2, Trim72, Ube2g2, Ptges2).
This validation minipool reveals the dynamics of multiple competing mutants chosen from
the primary screen hits, and indicates that mutants with strong pro-growth effects tend to
enhance metastases (Figure 7E).

TCGA gene expression of screen hits in human lung cancer
To assess the relevance of our mGeCKOa and validation minipool screen hits (genes
targeted by sgRNAs enriched in lung metastases) to pathological metastasis in human
cancer, we performed gene expression analysis of the human orthologs of these genes. We
compared mRNA levels in metastatic compared to non-metastatic primary tumors in patients
samples using TCGA mRNA sequencing data. We found that most (61 – 75%) of these
genes are downregulated in metastatic tumors in non-small cell lung cancer patients (Figure
S5D–E, Table S6). These data suggest that downregulation of these genes is selected for in
metastatic tumors from patients.

Discussion

Pooled mutagenesis in a metastasis model
Distal metastases develop as primary tumors shed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) into the
circulation, from which CTCs travel to the destination site, move out of the blood vessels
and initiate clonal growth (Valastyan and Weinberg, 2011; Vanharanta and Massague, 2013;
Weinberg, 2007). In this study, cancer cells transplanted into the flanks of mice form
primary tumors in situ, and cells from this mass undergo the intravasation – circulation extravasation - clonal growth cascade to form distal metastases (Francia et al., 2011). The

initial lung cancer cell line has little capacity to form metastases; in contrast, after being
mutagenized with the mGeCKOa genome-scale Cas9 knockout library, the cell population
form highly metastatic tumors. Thus, these mutations, acting in simple or complex,
pleiotropic ways, accelerate metastasis. In this model, the effect of mutations on metastasis
strongly correlates with their abundance in late stage primary tumors.
SgRNA dynamics during tumor evolution

Author Manuscript

The dynamics of the sgRNA population changed dramatically over the course of tumor
development and metastasis, reflecting the selection and bottlenecks of cellular evolution in
vitro and in vivo. After a week in culture, cells retained most of the sgRNAs present in the
plasmid library, with decreases in sgRNAs targeting genes involved in fundamental cellular
processes. The distribution of non-targeting control sgRNAs is almost identical to those
targeting genes, suggesting that the selective pressure of in vitro culture alone does not
radically alter sgRNA representation, which is similar to previous observations in human
melanoma cells (Shalem et al., 2014).
In contrast, less than half of the sgRNAs survive in an early stage primary tumor. This loss
of representation occurs with both gene-targeting sgRNAs and non-targeting control
sgRNAs, suggesting that random-sampling influences the sgRNA dynamics during the
transplantation and tumor initiation processes, although we cannot exclude that some of the
non-targeting sgRNAs might have detrimental or pro-growth effects. We also detected
further dropout of genes involved in fundamental cellular processes in early tumor samples
compared to cell samples. Thus, it is likely that the sgRNA dynamics are influenced by a
combination of selection and random sampling during transplantation and tumor initiation.

Author Manuscript

As primary tumors grow, the mutant cells proliferate and compete as a pool. This creates
strong selection for sgRNAs targeting anti-apoptotic genes and other tumor suppressors. The
majority of the genetic diversity in early tumors is lost during the subsequent 4 weeks of
primary tumor growth. Accordingly, sequencing revealed a smaller set of dominant
sgRNAs, usually on the order of hundreds to a few thousand per mouse. In addition, almost
all of non-targeting sgRNAs are lost during primary tumor growth, which is consistent with
selection for cells with special growth and survival properties. This observation is also
consistent with earlier transplantation studies by Kerbel and colleagues using small pools of
randomly mutagenized cells, which found that the majority of clonal variants detectable by
Southern blot disappeared within six weeks of primary tumor growth, leaving one dominant
clone (Korczak et al., 1988; Waghorne et al., 1988).

Author Manuscript

Each step towards metastasis acts as a bottleneck. In the lung metastases, we detected very
few sgRNAs at high abundance. As with the primary tumor, we find only a few nontargeting sgRNAs at low frequencies in metastases. Their presence could be due to unknown
off-target effects of these sgRNAs, or random shedding of CTCs in the primary tumor, or
clustering together with other strongly selected CTCs during metastasis (Aceto et al., 2014).

Relevance of screen hits to human cancer

Author Manuscript

Several of the genes enriched in late stage primary tumors are associated with cancer, but
their functions in tumor growth are poorly understood. For example, Mgmt, a gene with two
enriched sgRNAs, is required for DNA repair and thus crucial for genome stability (Tano et
al., 1990). Mutation, silencing or promoter methylation of MGMT is associated with primary
glioblastomas (Jesien-Lewandowicz et al., 2009). Med16, another gene with two enriched
sgRNAs, encodes a subunit of the mediator complex of transcription regulation, which has
been recently implicated in cancer (Huang et al., 2012; Schiano et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

We found that the genes that are significantly enriched in lung metastases largely overlap
with those found in abundance in the late primary tumor. Several of these hits were
validated in vivo using multiple individual sgRNAs, including Nf2, Pten, Cdkn2a, Trim72,
Fga, miR-152 and miR-345. Nf2, Pten and Cdkn2a are well-known tumor suppressor genes.
Intriguingly, the NF2 locus is only mutated at a 1% frequency in primary tumors of human
NSCLC patients (LUAD and/or LUSC) (TCGA-Network, 2012, 2014). It is possible that
NF2 mutations influence metastases to a greater degree than primary tumor growth, but this
awaits metastasis genomics from patient samples. Pten mutations are also associated with
advanced stages of tumor progression in a mouse model of lung cancer (McFadden et al.,
2014), and PTEN was found mutated at 8% in adenocarcinoma patients (LUAD). CDKN2A
has been shown to be often inactivated in lung cancer (Kaczmarczyk et al., 2012; Yokota et
al., 2003). For Trim72 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) and Fga (the extracellular matrix protein
fibrinogen involved in blood clot formation), there is little information associating them to
metastasis or cancer. Studies have shown that miR-152 and miR-345 are associated with
cancer and metastasis (Cheng et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2011). FGF2 and BAG3, which
promote metastasis, were predicted targets of miR-152 and miR-345, thus loss of these
microRNAs may lead to acceleration of metastases likely due to de-repression of these
genes (Cheng et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2011).

Author Manuscript

In our own analysis of TCGA samples from lung cancer patients, we observed
downregulation of the human orthologs of the genes identified in the genome-wide and
validation minipool screens at the mRNA level in metastatic tumors compared to nonmetastatic tumors (Figure S5D–E, Table S6, Supplemental Results and Discussion),
suggesting that these genes may also be inactivated during pathological metastasis. Human
orthologs of these genes are often found mutated in cancers (Figure S5A–C). Moreover,
these genes have been implicated in various pathways and biological processes in
tumorigenesis and/or metastasis in human cancer (Table S7A–C). However, most cancer
sequencing studies involve samples from primary tumors of patients. In the clinic,
metastases are rarely sampled. Future patient sequencing directly from metastases may
further connect genes identified in the mouse model to those mutated or silenced in clinical
metastases.
Future in vivo functional genomic screens
Our study provides a roadmap for in vivo Cas9 screens and future studies can take advantage
of this model to explore other oncogenotypes, delivery methods or metastasis target organs.
Genome-scale CRISPR screening is feasible using a transplant model with virtually any cell

line or genetic background (e.g. mutations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, etc.), including a large
repertoire of human cell lines from diverse cancer types (Barretina et al., 2012). Other cell
delivery methods, such as intravenous injection or orthotopic transplantation, may help
identify genes regulating extravasation and clonalization. Examining samples from other
stages or sites, such as CTCs or metastases to other organs can provide a more refined
picture of tumor evolution.

In addition to these parameters, several aspects of the screen perturbations themselves can
also be modified. Targeted drug therapies or immunotherapies can be applied in conjunction
with the in vivo screening strategy to identify genes involved in acquired resistance. Recent
advances in screen technology, such as Cas9-mediated activation (Gilbert et al., 2014;
Konermann et al., 2014), may be used to identify metastasis-regulating factors that act in a
gain-of-function manner. Activation screens that identify oncogenes, as well as dropout
screens that identify genetic dependencies, may facilitate identification of novel therapeutic
targets. Targeted subpool strategies can be used to reduce the library size and facilitate
further confirmation of primary screens. In a customized library, genes can be chosen based
on genomic analysis, pathways, or clinical relevance for focused screening libraries.
Additionally, application of pooled sgRNA libraries using individually barcoded cells will
allow quantitative assessment of the robustness and significance of each candidate hit as
well as enable analysis of the competitive dynamics amongst different perturbations. Taken
together, Cas9-based in vivo screening establishes a new platform for functional genomic
discovery.

Experimental Procedures
Generation of Cas9-GFP expression vector

Author Manuscript

A lentiviral vector, lenti-Cas9-NLS-FLAG-2A-EGFP (lentiCas9-EGFP), was generated by
subcloning Cas9 into a lentiviral vector.
Pooled guide-only library cloning and viral production
The Cas9-GFP KPD cell line was transduced at a MOI of ~ 0.4 with a genome-wide

tumor sizes were measured by caliper. At 6 weeks post transplantation, mice were sacrificed
and several organs (liver, lung, kidney and spleen) were dissected for examination of
metastases under a fluorescent stereoscope.
Mouse tissue collection
Primary tumors and other organs were dissected manually. For molecular biology, tissues
were flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, ground in 24 Well Polyethylene Vials with metal
beads in a GenoGrinder machine (OPS diagnostics). Homogenized tissues were used for
DNA/RNA/protein extractions using standard molecular biology protocols. Tissues for
histology were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde or 10% formalin overnight, embedded in
paraffin, and sectioned at 6 μm with a microtome as described previously (Chen et al.,
2014). Slices were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as described
previously (Chen et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

Genomic DNA extraction from cells and mouse tissues
Genomic DNA from cells and tissues (primary tumors and lungs) were extracted using a
homemade modified salt precipitation method similar to the Puregene (Qiagen/Gentra)
procedure. The sgRNA cassette was amplified and prepared for Illumina sequencing as
previously described (Shalem et al., 2014). A detailed readout protocol can be found in
Extended Experimental Procedures.
Individual gene and microRNA validation

Author Manuscript

Six sgRNAs per protein coding gene and four sgRNAs per microRNA gene were chosen for
validation using individual sgRNAs (Table S4). For protein coding genes, we cloned gene.
For microRNAs, we used all 4 sgRNAs from the mGeCKOa library.
Validation and control minipool synthesis and in vivo transplantation
Validation and control minipools (Tables S5) were synthesized using array oligonucleotide
synthesis (CustomArray) and transduced at >1000-fold representation in Cas9-GFP KPD
cells. After 7 days in culture, Cas9-GFP KPD cells transduced with the validation minipool
or control minipool were injected subcutaneously into the right side flank of Nu/Nu mice at
3x107 cells per mouse with 5 replicate mice. After five weeks, mice were sacrificed, and
primary tumors and lungs were dissected.

(A) Pie charts of the most abundant sgRNAs in the primary tumor and the whole lung of two
representative mice transplanted with validation minipool transduced Cas9-GFP KPD cells.
The area for each sgRNA corresponds to the fraction of total reads from the tissue (primary
tumor or lung metastases) for the sgRNA. All sgRNAs with ≥ 2% of total reads are plotted
individually.
(B) Scatterplot of normalized sgRNA read counts in primary tumor and lung metastases for
all sgRNAs in the validation minipool for each mouse (different color dots indicate sgRNAs
from different mice). log2 n.r., log2 normalized reads.
(C) log2 ratio of sgRNA abundance in the lung metastases over the primary tumor
(Metastasis-Primary Ratio, or MPR) plotted against the abundance in the lung metastases (n
= 5 mice per sgRNA). Green dots are the 100 control sgRNAs. Dots with black outlines are
non-control sgRNAs that target genes or miRs. Red dots indicate non-control sgRNAs for
which more than one sgRNA targeting the same gene/miR is enriched in the lung metastases
over the primary tumor (i.e. log2(MPR) > 0 ) and are labeled with the gene/miR targeted.
The lung-primary ratio is calculated for individual mice and these quantities are averaged
across mice.
