ABSTRACT
The phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is
frequently hyper-activated upon vemurafenib treatment of melanoma. We have here
investigated the relationship between SRY-box 10 (SOX10), forkhead box 3 (FOXD3)
and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in the regulation of the
receptor tyrosine-protein kinase ERBB3, and its cognate ligand neuregulin 1-beta
(NRG1-beta). We found that both NRG1-beta and ERBB3 mRNA levels were elevated
as a consequence of MITF depletion, induced by either vemurafenib or MITF small
interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment. Elevation of ERBB3 receptor expression after
MITF depletion caused increased activation of the PI3K pathway in the presence
of NRG1-beta ligand. Together, our results suggest that MITF may play a role in
the development of acquired drug resistance through hyper-activation of the PI3K
pathway.

amplification, overexpression or mutation is associated
with tumor development and poor clinical prognosis in
most human cancers [14]. Previous studies have suggested
that increase in both EGFR and ERBB3 expression and
phosphorylation can be induced after mitogen-activating
protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor treatment [12, 15–20],
and that targeting EGFR and ERBB3 can prevent and
extend the establishment of MAPK inhibitor-induced
resistance in melanoma [12, 15, 17]. Transcription factors
such as FOXO1, FOXO3A, FOXD3, and SOX10 have
been reported to activate ERBB3 expression [15, 21–23].
Interestingly, SOX10 has been found to activate MITF
expression [24], while MITF is reported to repress FOXD3
expression and vice versa [25, 26].
Preliminary gene expression arrays suggested
to us that ERBB3 expression was elevated after MITF
depletion in the SKMEL28 cell line. Based on these
data, we have here investigated the relationship between
SOX10, FOXD3 and MITF in the regulation of the
receptor tyrosine-protein kinase ERBB3, and its cognate
ligand NRG1-beta. We found that depletion of MITF
protein resulted in elevation of ERBB3 and NRG1beta levels. The novel mechanism described here may

INTRODUCTION
Malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer form
with limited treatment options and poor survival for
patients with advanced disease. The small-molecular
inhibitor vemurafenib, that specifically inhibits the
BRAFV600 mutated protein function, has shown
remarkable response when used in patients [1–3].
Unfortunately, virtually all responders acquire resistance
over time [4]. Several resistance mechanisms have been
characterized [5–11], including receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) up-regulation or activation leading to sustained cell
survival and proliferation [12, 13]. Two recent reports have
suggested that microphthalmia-associated transcription
factor (MITF) loss is involved in the development of
vemurafenib resistance through up-regulation or activation
of RTKs such as AXL and EGFR [12, 13].
The EGFR family members of RTKs consist of
four family members; receptor tyrosine-protein kinase
ERBB1 to 4 (ERBB1/EGFR, ERBB2/HER2, ERBB3/
HER3, ERBB4/HER4, respectively). These receptors
are important regulators of normal growth and cell
differentiation. Their dysregulation in the form of

resistance in melanoma.

representing various alterations in the MAPK pathway
(NRAS, BRAF, NF1) and variable MITF expression
levels (Figure 1E). We found that mRNA and protein
expression levels correlated well for all cell lines
tested. FOXD3 and SOX10 have been reported to be
activators of ERBB3 transcription [15, 21], which
is in agreement with what we observed, as depletion
of FOXD3 and SOX10 levels resulted in reduced
ERBB3 expression. To our knowledge, no reports
exist concerning MITF regulation of ERBB3. Our
results show that MITF protein expression has an
inverse association with ERBB3 protein expression
in the MITF-expressing cell lines, particular in
the immortalized melanocyte cell line Hermes 4C,
WM983B and WM115 (Figure 1E).

RESULTS
Basal expression levels of SOX10, MITF, FOXD3
and ERBB3 in a melanoma cell line panel
We compared basal mRNA expression levels of
SOX10, MITF, FOXD3, and ERBB3 in immortalized
melanocytes, and in a panel of melanomas spanning
various genetic backgrounds (see Figure 1A-1D
and Supplementary Table S1). Out of the 18 cell
lines analyzed for mRNA expression, we selected
9 cell lines for further protein expression analysis,

Depletion of MITF elevates ERBB3 expression at
the transcriptional level

no changes were observed in WM1382, WM983B and
SKMEL28. To ensure that the elevated ERBB3 levels
after siMITF treatment was not caused by an off-target
effect, we also tested two other siMITF sequences and an
additional negative siRNA control. All the three individual
siMITF molecules resulted in elevation of ERBB3,
compared to untreated control and negative siRNA controls
(Supplementary Figure S1). In addition to siMITF treatment,
we also overexpressed the melanocyte-specific variant 4
(NM_000248) MITF protein by MITF mRNA delivery,
resulting in reduction of ERBB3 mRNA levels after 24h in
A375 and MeWo (See Supplementary Figure S2).

To further explore the relationship between MITF
and ERBB3, we depleted MITF and ERBB3 levels by
the use of siRNA molecules in five MITF-expressing
cell lines differing in MAPK pathway backgrounds (see
Supplementary Table S1). Elevation of the ERBB3 mRNA
and protein levels were detected 72h post siMITF treatment
for all five cell lines tested (Figure 2A-2E). Transfection
of the same cell lines with siERBB3 resulted in reduction
of MITF protein levels in Hermes 4C and MeWo, while

Elevation of the ERBB3 receptor expression
levels increases pAKT levels

complete depletion of pAKT (S473) levels was observed
after co-transfection, while only the hyper-activated levels
of pAKT (S473) were depleted in the WM983B cell line.
To address the observed increase in pERBB3 (T1289)
levels after siMITF treatment observed in non-NRG1-beta
treated WM983B samples (See Supplementary Figure
S3A), we measured the NRG1-beta mRNA levels. We
found an increase in NRG1-beta mRNA expression levels
in WM983B (Figure 3C). No measureable levels of NRG1beta mRNA were detected in MeWo by qPCR analysis.
Since we did not detect any NRG1-beta in the BRAF wildtype cell line MeWo, we investigated two other BRAF
wild-type cell lines, the metastatic melanoma cell line
WM1382 (Figure 3D) and the immortalized melanocyte
cell line Hermes 4C (Figure 3E). Also these cell lines
showed elevation of NRG1-beta mRNA levels after MITF
depletion. When overexpressing MITF protein by mRNA

To address whether depletion of MITF protein
activates the PI3K pathway through NRG1-beta/ERBB3
signaling in both mutant and wild-type BRAF melanoma
cell lines, we co-transfected WM983B and MeWo with
MITF and ERBB3 siRNA molecules in combination with
NRG1-beta treatment (Figure 3A–3B), or without NRG1beta treatment (See Supplementary Figure S3A-S3B). After
72h of siMITF treatment, we observed an induction of
both phospho-ERBB3-T1289 (pERBB3) and total ERBB3
expression, together with an increase in pAKT (S473) in
both cell lines tested. In contrast to siMITF transfection
alone, co-transfection of the WM983B and MeWo cell lines
with siMITF and siERBB3 resulted in loss of pERBB3
(T1289), total ERBB3 and pAKT (S473). In MeWo, a

without (see Supplementary Figure S3A-S3B) 10ng/ml NRG1-beta ligand 15min prior to harvesting. All experiments were performed in
triplicate. Histone H3 was used as loading control. C-D. qRT-PCR data show mRNA elevation of NRG1-beta ligand after MITF depletion in

transfection in A375 harboring low MITF levels, we
observed a minor reduction of NRG1-beta mRNA levels
after 24h (See Supplementary Figure S2A).

FOXD3 protein levels (Figure 4A–4C). When transfecting
the cell lines with siFOXD3 alone, no differences in
ERBB3 protein levels were detected in MeWo compared
to a negative siRNA control. However, we observed a
minor reduction of ERBB3 protein levels in WM983B
and WM115. To explore whether MITF depletion results
in elevation of ERBB3 through FOXD3, we performed an
siRNA co-transfection of MITF and FOXD3 in all three
cell lines, demonstrating an increase in ERBB3 protein
levels compared to negative siRNA control in WM983B
and MeWo, while no change was detected in WM115.

MITF regulates ERBB3 in a FOXD3 dependent
and independent manner
To investigate the role of SOX10, MITF, and
FOXD3 and the reported effects due to BRAF status in
ERBB3 regulation, we depleted the three former genes
individually and in combination for MITF/FOXD3
by the use of siRNA in three melanoma cell lines:
WM983B, MeWo and WM115. MeWo represent BRAF
wild type, while WM983B and WM115 harbor mutant
BRAF. Additionally, the WM115 cell line was utilized
in a previous study by Abel et al. [15], were the authors
reported that FOXD3 is an activator of ERBB3 expression
only in V600 cell lines. Our results show that siSOX10
treatment reduces the MITF, FOXD3 and ERBB3 protein
levels in all cell lines (Figure 4A–4C). In contrast, siMITF
treatment resulted in an increase in both ERBB3 and

MITF binding sites in ERBB3, NRG1-beta and
FOXD3
To address whether MITF protein binds DNA
in the proximity of ERBB3, NRG1-beta, and FOXD3,
we performed a 3xHA-tagged MITF ChIP-seq analysis
in the Hermes 4C cell line. Results showed a strong
MITF binding signal in the putative regulatory region,
approximately 18kb upstream of the transcription start

site, and two minor binding signals in the promoter
region of ERBB3 (Figure 5A). In the putative regulatory
region, we detected both an E-box (CACATG) and a
SOX10 binding motif (AACAAT), while no E-boxes
were found in the promoter region. In the NRG1beta gene, we detected a strong MITF binding signal
in the regulatory region within the first intron. This
MITF binding signal contained two E-box motifs and
was located approximately 30kb downstream of the
transcription start site. Furthermore, we detected a minor
MITF binding signal in the proximal promoter region of
NRG1-beta, without any E-box motifs (Figure 5B). When

investigating the FOXD3 gene, we found a MITF binding
signal containing an E-box motif in the promoter region
(Figure 5C).

Correlation between SOX10 and ERBB3 in
patient samples
To investigate the relationship between SOX10,
MITF, FOXD3, ERBB3 and NRG1 in patient samples,
we utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA,
SKCM), which contains a set of 474 melanoma patient
samples. A strong correlation (R = 0.74, P = <0.0001)

was found between SOX10 and ERBB3 (Figure 6).
Correlations were also detected between FOXD3
and ERBB3 (R = 0.55, P = <0.0001), SOX10 and
FOXD3 (R = 0.56, P = <0.0001), and SOX10 and
MITF (R = 0.49, P = <0.0001). Among the genes
investigated, MITF and NRG1 showed weakest
correlation with ERBB3, with R = 0.43 and R = 0.18,
respectively. Interestingly, we observed an inverse
correlation between MITF and NRG1 (R = -0.4,
P = <0.0001) in the TCGA data. TYR, in addition to
two genes assumed uncorrelated to MITF, RPLPO and
ACTB, were included as controls.

after MITF depletion in various melanoma cell lines. Our
data is supported by previous studies showing that both
ERBB3 expression and phosphorylation can be elevated
after MAPK inhibitor treatment [15–20]. Hyper-activation
of the PI3K/AKT pathway due to increased NRG1-beta/
ERBB3 pathway signaling has previously been reported to
be responsible for acquired drug resistance in BRAFV600
melanomas [15, 17]. However, also low MITF/AXL and
MITF/EGFR ratios have been suggested to be involved in
early resistance to vemurafenib in a subset of melanomas
[12, 13]. Together, these reports suggest that MITF loss
after vemurafenib treatment, followed by PI3K/AKT
elevation, is a key element to overcome drug treatment
and in acquiring drug resistance against MAPK inhibitors.
Both gain and loss of MITF after vemurafenib has been
reported [13]. The molecular mechanism behind these
alterations in MITF levels is presently not known. In the
SKMEL28 and WM983B cell lines, we observed that
SOX10, an activator of MITF transcription, was reduced
after vemurafenib treatment. However, as also both gain
and loss of SOX10 protein after vemurafenib-induced
MITF loss have been reported in the literature [13], the
role of SOX10 in vemurafenib-induced MITF loss remains
unclear.
SOX10 and FOXD3 have been reported to
activate ERBB3 expression [15, 21], in addition to also
activating and repressing MITF expression, respectively
[24, 25, 27]. In this context, we investigated their role
in ERBB3 regulation. When depleting FOXD3 in the
two BRAFV600 cell lines WM983B and WM115, we

Vemurafenib treatment results in loss of MITF
and elevation of FOXD3 and ERBB3
As vemurafenib has been reported to induce loss of
MITF, we measured the protein expression levels of MITF,
SOX10, FOXD3 and ERBB3 after inhibitor treatment
in the WM983B and SKMEL28 cell lines (Figure 7).
An extensive decrease in MITF protein levels after two
weeks of vemurafenib treatment was observed in both cell
lines, while a minor reduction in SOX10 levels could be
detected. In contrast, we measured elevated ERBB3 and
FOXD3 protein levels in the same samples.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have demonstrated that the ERBB3
receptor and its cognate ligand NRG1-beta are elevated

detected a minor reduction of ERBB3 protein, which
is in agreement with what Abel et al. [15] measured
in the WM115 cell line. In the MeWo cell line,
FOXD3 depletion alone did not affect ERBB3 protein
expression. This is supported by Abel and Aplin [28],
who showed that FOXD3 does not regulate ERBB3
expression in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells, nor
in melanocytes. Furthermore, our siRNA depletion
results demonstrated that SOX10 and MITF have
opposite roles in the regulation of FOXD3 and ERBB3
expression. The observed FOXD3 elevation after MITF
depletion is in agreement with He et al. [26] and implies
that MITF can repress ERBB3 expression indirectly
by suppressing FOXD3 in V600 cell lines. However,
our data also demonstrate that MITF protein can bind
directly to the regulatory region of ERBB3, as well
as NRG1-beta and FOXD3. Together with our siRNA
experiments, these latter results suggest that MITF
can repress ERBB3 both with and without FOXD3
involvement, depending on the BRAF mutational
status, as shown in this study. In the regulatory region
of ERBB3, we detected a SOX10 binding site 40 bp
downstream of the MITF-binding E-box, suggesting
SOX10/MITF co-localization. Co-localization of MITF
and SOX10 in the form of MITF-associated regulatory
elements (MARE), where MITF alone, or with SOX10,
binds between two BRG1-bound nucleosomes, has
previously been described [29]. However, the precise
mechanism(s) by which MITF represses ERBB3,
FOXD3 and NRG1-beta expression remains the subject
of ongoing investigation. An inverse relationship
between MITF and ERBB3 protein expression
levels was observed in our cell panel, and this was
particularly evident in the immortalized melanocyte
cell line Hermes 4C, and in the melanoma cell lines
WM983B and WM115. Simultaneously, our results
show that high MITF protein levels, in Hermes 4C, are
not able to completely abolish ERBB3 transcription,
implying the existence of a threshold with respect
to MITF-induced repression of ERBB3 expression.
This is also supported by the moderate suppression
of ERBB3 expression detected when overexpressing
MITF protein in MeWo and A375. We also observed
an inverse correlation between MITF and NRG1-beta
in the 474 patient samples from TCGA. In contrast, no
inverse correlation was observed between MITF and
ERBB3 in the TCGA samples. The reason for the lack
of inverse correlation between MITF and ERBB3 in
patient samples is not known, but could result from the
fact that MITF suppression of ERBB3 seems to be only
partial, and to depend on SOX10 expression. SOX10dependent MITF repression of ERBB3 is supported by
the observation that cell lines without both SOX10 and
MITF (WM1366, WM852, LOXIMVI) lack ERBB3.
In summary, we have in this study shown that MITF
depletion results in elevated expression levels of both
the ERBB3 receptor and its cognate ligand NRG1-beta,

which may have potential implications for acquired drug
resistance in melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
The SKMEL28, MeWo, and A375 cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC; Rockville, MD, USA), WM35, WM115,
WM1341B, WM1366, WM983B, WM45.1, WM239A,
WM266.4, WM852, WM1382, WM9, WM793B from
the Wistar Institute, and LOXIMVI established in-house.
For genetic background information, see Supplementary
Table S1. The immortalized melanocyte cell line Hermes
3C and 4C were purchased from Wellcome Trust
Functional Genomics Cell Bank [30]. Hermes 3C and
4C were cultured and maintained in 254 medium (Gibco,
Invitrogen, Oslo, Norway) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) (PAA, New Bedford, MA, USA), 200nM
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma-Aldrich),
200pM (Hermes 3C) and 2pM (Hermes 4C) cholera toxin
(Sigma-Aldrich), 10ng/ml human stem cell factor (hSCF;
Thermo Fisher) and 10nM endothilin (EDN1; Millipore,
Oslo, Norway) with the exception of where noted in the
text. All melanoma cell lines were cultured and maintained
in RPMI 1640 medium (Bio Whittaker, Verviers,
Belgium), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
(PAA, New Bedford, MA, USA) and 2mM GlutaMAX
(Gibco, Invitrogen, Oslo, Norway) with the exception of
where noted in the text. The cells were maintained at 37°C
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were
routinely tested for Mycoplasma infections (VenorGeM,
Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany), and the cell line
identities were also verified by short tandem repeat (STR)
analysis.

Transfection and RNA interference
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to
60% confluence before being transfected and incubated
for 72h with siRNA directed against MITF-M and
SOX10 (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), ERBB3 (Life
Technologies) and FOXD3 (Dharmacon). The reason
for choosing 72h incubation time was to ensure optimal
reduction of our targets at the protein level. The cells were
transfected with a final concentration of 25pmol siRNA,
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as described
in the manufacturers protocol. Sequences for siRNA can
be found in the Supplementary Methods. All siRNA
transfections were performed in triplicate.

Western immunoblotting
Preparations of whole cell lysates were performed
by addition of lysis buffer (150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl

dry cell pellets. The samples were left on ice for 30min
with intermittent vortexing, followed by sonication and
centrifugation to remove cell debris. Protein quantification
was done using a standard Bradford protein assay (BioRad Laboratories, Inc., CA). Protein lysates (30μg) were
separated on 4-12% NuPAGE® Novex Bis-Tris MidiGels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then transferred
to a membrane using an iBlot Dry Blotting system
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers
instruction. The membranes were subsequently blocked in
TBS/T (137mM NaCl, 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 0.1%
tween20) containing 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,
Germany) for 1h, and then incubated with primary
antibodies over night at 4°C with gentle agitation. Residual
primary antibodies were removed by washing 3 × 10min
in TBS/T. The membranes were thereafter incubated
for 1h at RT with horse radish peroxidase conjugated
(HRP) secondary antibody. The membranes were then
washed 3 × 10min with TBS/T. The protein bands were
visualized in the G-Box iChemi Chemiluminescence
Image Capture (Syngene, England) using the SuperSignal
chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce).

to the manufacturers manuals. RNA concentration was
measured using NANODROP 2000 (Thermo Scientific).
Real-time detection was obtained by use of SYBR
Green. For each PCR, 100ng cDNA, 30μl PerfeCTa™
SYBR® Green SuperMix for iQ (Quanta Biosciences,
Gaithersburg, USA), 300nM of each primer and nucleasefree water was added to a final volume of 60μl. The
final volume of 60μl was then split into two parallels
of 25μl and added to the PCR plate. Primers against
MITF-M, ERBB3, SOX10, FOXD3 and NRG1-beta were
ordered from Integrated DNA technologies (IDT). Realtime reactions were run on a CFX Connect Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with the following
amplification protocol: 3 min initial denaturation at 95°C,
40 cycles of 15s denaturation at 95°C and 35s annealing/
extension at 60°C, one hold at 95°C for 10 s followed by
a hold for 30s at 60°C. Finally, a melt curve analysis was
performed, starting at 60°C, increasing with 0.5°C steps
(8s) until reaching a final temperature of 95°C. The quality
of the RNA samples was verified by amplification of two
housekeeping genes, the TATA-binding protein (TBP)
and the human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO
(RPLPO). These housekeeping genes were chosen as they
were unchanged by the different treatment modalities in
this study (data not shown). Bio-Rad, CFX manager 3.1,
was used for the quantitative calculations. The program
performs calculations based on the ΔΔ CT method [31],
which allows comparison of cycle threshold values
obtained using different sets of primers on the same set
of samples.

FOXD3 (1:1000; #2019), SOX10 (1:1000; #14374), Akt
(1:2000; #9272), Phospho-Akt-Serine-473 XP (1:2000;
#4060), and Histone H3 (1:3000; #4499) was used
as loading control. Secondary antibody against rabbit
(1:5000; P0448) was purchased from Dako (Agilent
Technologies, Glostrup, Denmark). The small molecular
inhibitor vemurafenib (Plexxikon 4032) was obtained
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). The
NRG1-beta ligand was purchased from ImmunoTools
GmbH (Friesoythe, Germany). The NRG1-beta ligand
was used to enhance the pERBB3 (T1289) signal, as
our Phospho-Her3/ERBB3-Tyrosine-1289 antibody did
not detect pERBB3 (T1289) levels without NRG1-beta
addition (see also Supplementary Figure S3A-S3B).
The reason for choosing 15min of incubation time and a
NRG1-beta ligand concentration of 10ng/ml was due to a
previous study where they showed efficient activation of
the ERBB3 receptor in the WM115 cell line under these
conditions [18].

Chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing
(ChIPseq) protocol
Hermes 4C was transduced by lentiparticles
carrying pLX3xHAvar4mCherry. Stable cell lines
expressing the 3xHA tagged MITFvar4 were subsequently
sorted based on the presence of mCherry and used further
(sorted by Flow Cytometry Core Facility, OUS, Norway).
Chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing (ChIPseq)
experiments were performed twice as described by
Dahl JA and Collas P [32] with modifications. Briefly,
chromatin from native Hermes 4C and Hermes 4C
cells (mycoplasma unverified) stably transfected with
a lentiviral vector expressing 3xHA-tagged MITF were
fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 8min to cross-link DNA
and proteins. Cross-linking was stopped with 125mM
glycine for 5min. Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), harvested using trypsination and
sedimented. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis
buffer (1% SDS, 10mM EDTA, 50mM Tris–HCl, pH
8.0) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cells
were sonicated at 4°C using a Covaris S2 instrument to
yield chromatin fragments of 300–500 bp. Chromatin was
cleared by centrifugation, concentration determined by
A260, and chromatin was diluted in RIPA buffer (0.1%
SDS, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM

Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
Total cellular RNA was isolated with the GenElute
Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich,
Steinheim, Germany) and the qScript™ cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, USA) was used
for reverse transcription. Both kits were used according

EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 140mM NaCl, 10mM Tris–HCl,
pH 8.0) to 2 A260 units. Each immunoprecipitation
was performed in 250μl RIPA buffer with 1μg antibody
overnight at 4°C. The antibody: anti-HA-tag (12CA5,
Roche) was used. Antibody-bound chromatin was
precipitated using Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen)
and washed 3 times in RIPA buffer, once in TE buffer
(10mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 10mM EDTA) and eluted in
1% SDS with 100mM NaHCO3. Eluted chromatin was
incubated at 65°C with proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich;
50μg/ml) over night, and DNA was purified by phenolchloroform-isoamylalcohol extraction (25:24:1) and
once with chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1) followed
by ethanol precipitation. DNA was dissolved in H2O and
used for high-throughput sequencing using an Illumina
Hiseq 2500 sequencer. The sequencing reads were
aligned to hg19 using Bowtie v.1.0.0, after which MACS
v 1.4.2 was used to call peaks. To get a common set of
peaks for the two samples, the two. bed files containing
the peaks were put together and sorted before using
BEDTools v2.7.1 to merge them. IntersectBed was then
used to get the number of reads falling into each peak
for all samples. The counts were read into R, where two
sets of normalized counts were computed, one using
size normalization and one using quantile normalization
from the package preprocessCore. Logfold2 change was
computed for the two CHIPed samples. CHIP vs INPUT
counts were plotted for Hermes4c and histograms were
made of the log fold change values.

Lentiparticles were produced in Lenti-X 293T
(Clontech) using the designated lenti-expression vector and
the second generation packaging system utilizing pCMVdR8.2 dvpr and pCMV-VSV-G as previously described [34]
with the following modification: The transfection reagent
Fugene (Promega) was replaced by Turbofect (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and applied as recommended by the manufacturer.

Statistical analysis
P values were calculated using a student t-test.
Values p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

GRANT SUPPORT

Construction of pLX3xHAvar4mCh

We gratefully acknowledge the funding by Helse
Sør-Øst (project number 2014044), and the support of The
Norwegian Cancer Society (project number 71220 - PR2006-0433).

The construction of pLX 3xHAvar4mCh was
performed by two sequential clonings. The human MITF
variant 4 cDNA was prepared by PCR amplification
of the cDNA clone MGC:75121 (IMAGE:6066096)
(Invitrogen) using the BglII containing MITF forward
primer:5′-AAAAAAAGATCTACCATGCTGGAAAT
GCTAG-3′ and the EcoRI containing reverse primer:
5′-AAAAAGATTTCATCTCGCTAACAAGTGTGC.
Subsequent to restriction digestion by BglII and EcoRI
the insert was gel purified. The mouse equivalent
of the human MITF var4 cDNA was removed from
pCMV3xHAvar4 plasmid by BglII/ EcoRI endonuclease
digestion [33]. The insert and vector were then ligated
overnight at 14°C, transformed into chemically
competent DH5α and selected candidates were screened
by PCR for the presence of the insert. The successful
construct pCMV3xHAvar4 was digested with NheI/XbaI
and the 5′ 3xHA tagged MITF variant 4 fusion insert was
isolated by gel purification. The insert was then ligated
into gene cleaned (Genomed) SpeI linearized pLVX IRES
mCh (Clontech) producing the Lenti-expression vector
pLX3xHAvar4mCherry and transformed into chemically
competent STBL3 (Invitrogen). pLX3xHAvar4mCherry
was subsequently sequenced to confirm the correctness
of the insertion.
