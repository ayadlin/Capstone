Abstract
Bone marrow angiogenesis is associated with multiple myeloma (MM) progression. Here, we report high constitutive hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α) expression in MM cells,
which is associated with oncogenic c-Myc. A drug screen for
anti-MM agents that decrease Hif-1α and c-Myc levels identified a variety of compounds, including bortezomib, lenalidomide, enzastaurin, and adaphostin. Functionally, based on
transient knockdowns and overexpression, our data delineate
a c-Myc/Hif-1α–dependent pathway mediating vascular
endothelial growth factor production and secretion. The
antiangiogenic activity of our tool compound, adaphostin,
was subsequently shown in a zebrafish model and translated
into a preclinical in vitro and in vivo model of MM in the bone
marrow milieu. Our data, therefore, identify Hif-1α as a novel
molecular target in MM and add another facet to anti-MM
drug activity. [Cancer Res 2009;69(12):5082–90]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignant disorder of
postgerminal center B cells characterized by clonal proliferation
of immunoglobulin-secreting malignant plasma cells in the bone
marrow (BM). Tumor cells are extremely heterogeneous, either hypodiploid with IgH translocations or hyperdiploid with multiple
trisomies and a variety of genetic mutations. In addition, the intimate reciprocal relationship between tumor cells and the cellular
and noncellular microenvironment, the BM vasculature in particular, plays a pivotal role in MM pathophysiology. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is expressed and secreted by
MM cells and increased in cocultures of MM cells with stromal
cells, is the most potent angiogenic factor. Functionally, VEGF increases BM microvascular density (MVD), as well as triggers MM
cell proliferation, survival, and migration in both a paracrine and
autocrine manner. MVD is correlated with MM progression and
poor prognosis (1).

The helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor c-Myc is
a proto-oncogene associated with cell apoptosis via an ARFMdm2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway and loss of differentiation.
Lethality in c-myc (−/−) mouse embryos is in part associated
with a requirement for c-Myc for VEGF expression, as VEGF
can partially rescue defects in differentiation and growth, including
vasculogenesis (2). Deregulated or elevated expression of c-Myc
(oncogenic c-Myc) is independent of external signals and occurs
in ∼30% of human cancers, including breast, colon, cervical, small
cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, and
myeloid leukemias. Besides directly coordinating multiple intracellular programs that mediate metabolic activity and drive proliferation, c-Myc facilitates tumor cell growth via angiogenesis in a
highly complex manner, further highlighting the intimate interrelation of tumor and microenvironment (3). Specifically, although
oncogenic, c-Myc activation is accompanied by overwhelming apoptosis. It is only after suppression of c-Myc–induced apoptosis by
coexpression of Bcl-xL that c-Myc triggers rapid and uniform progression into angiogenic, invasive tumors (2). Indeed, c-Myc has
been postulated to be the master regulator of angiogenic factors,
most prominently VEGF, and to be preeminent for the angiogenic
switch required for tumor progression and metastasis (4, 5). For
example, targeted skin expression of c-Myc induces VEGF protein
release and, in conjunction with hypoxia, further increases VEGF
protein levels and angiogenesis (6). In MM, complex karyotypic abnormalities of the c-myc locus have been reported in the majority
of MM cell lines, including MM.1S, KMS-12, OPM-1, OPM-2, OCIMy5, and RPMI8226. For example, our model MM.1S cell line carries a constant region of IgH (CH) insertion and duplication of cMyc and CH on chromosome 8 (7). Rearrangements of c-Myc are
reported in nearly 40% of advanced human MM. Enforced expression of c-Myc by immunoglobulin enhancers with peak activity in
plasma cells recapitulates some features of human MM in a murine model (8). Moreover, a conditional mouse model of sporadic
MM strongly supports a pivotal role for c-Myc deregulation in the
progression of benign MGUS to malignant MM (9). Functional mechanisms of c-Myc mediating disease progression are not fully elucidated, and a role of c-Myc in triggering MM BM angiogenesis
may be a contributing factor (5, 6, 10). Consistent with this hypothesis, our own previous studies (11) show that VEGF production
and secretion in MM cells is c-Myc dependent.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α) is a prominent transcription factor regulating angiogenesis, predominantly via induction
of VEGF transcription. In cancer, oxygen-independent and

c-Myc and Hif-1α in Multiple Myeloma

oxygen-dependent pathways regulate Hif-1α expression. Specifically,
intratumoral hypoxia induces Hif-1α expression, which is associated
with progression of cervical cancer, non–small cell lung cancer,
breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. However, Hif-1α is also induced
in an oxygen-independent way via growth-factor receptors or other
signaling molecules to maintain oxygen homeostasis. Specifically,
growth factors, signaling molecules, and loss of function mutations
of molecules such as VHL, p53, and PTEN, trigger Hif-1α synthesis in
stimulated cells, including cancer cells (12–14). Prior studies found
that bortezomib inhibits MM adaptation by stimulating factor-inhibiting Hif-1 (15) and that inhibitor of growth family member 4 suppresses Hif-1α activity and angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions
(16). Moreover, Asosingh and colleagues have suggested an important role of Hif-1α and BM hypoxia in MM progression (17).
Under physiologic conditions, Hif-1α inhibits c-Myc activity;
however, when deregulated oncogenic c-Myc collaborates with
Hif-1α in inducing the expression of VEGF (angiogenesis), PDK1,
and hexokinase 2 (glycolysis; refs. 18, 19). The relationship between
c-Myc and Hif-1α in MM and BM angiogenesis, as well as its potential as a target for novel and investigational anti-MM agents, is
unknown. Our results delineate a c-Myc/Hif-1α–dependent pathway modulating MM cell production and secretion of VEGF and
angiogenesis, even under normoxic conditions. Moreover, we show
that the tyrophostin adaphostin (NSC680410; refs. 20–22), as well
as other anti-MM agents, inhibit this c-Myc/Hif-1α–dependent
pathway, VEGF secretion, and tumor angiogenesis within the
MM microenvironment. Our data, therefore, identify Hif-1α as a
promising novel therapeutic target in MM.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Adaphostin (NSC 680410), the adamatyl ester analogue of the
tyrophostin AG957, was kindly provided by the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer
Institute. Antibodies directed against c-Myc, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase-2 (ERK-2), and actin were from Santa Cruz, and antibody against
Hif-1α was from Cell Signaling Technology.
Cell culture. All human MM cell lines and primary patient MM cells
were cultured as previously described (11). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells from a pool of five healthy donors (kindly provided by Drs. A. Cardoso and M. Tavares, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) were maintained in
EGM-2MV media (Cambrex) containing 2% fetal bovine serum. The collection and use of human tissue for this study was approved by the Internal
Review Board of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Informed consent was
obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Plasmids, small interfering RNAs, and transfections. 3× HRE luciferase plasmid was kindly provided by Drs. Q. Yan, W.G. Kaelin, and A. Kung
(Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; ref. 23). For generation of the mutated 3×
HRE construct, HRE sequences ACGTG were mutated to AAAAG using the
Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The
integrity of the mutated 3× HRE construct was verified by sequencing.
pcDNA3-cmyc plasmid 16011 (deposited by Dr. W. El-Deiry; ref. 24) was purchased from Addgene. For c-Myc– and Hif-1α–specific knockdown experiments, MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with indicated amounts of
small interfering RNA (siRNA) SMARTpool of cMyc and Hif-1α or nontargeting control (mock) siRNA (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions/Dharmacon RNA
Technologies) using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V Solution (Amaxa Biosystems/Lonza). Nontargeting control (mock) siRNA is composed of a pool
of four siRNAs, which have been characterized by genome-wide microarray
analysis and found to have minimal off-target signatures.
Cell lysis and Western blotting. Cell lysis and Western blot analysis
were performed as described previously (11).
Luciferase assay. For transcriptional transactivation experiments,
MM.1S cells were transfected with 3× HRE, mutated 3× HRE, or empty vec-

tor, using amaxa as indicated. At 24 hours after transfection, cells were
lysed and luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and Monolight 3010 Luminometer (BD Biosciences),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reporter activity is presented
as percentage of luciferase activity of the 3× HRE reporters relative to the
pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase control reporter.
ELISA. VEGF levels secreted by MM cells and BMSCs (3 × 105/mL) alone
or MM-BMSC cocultures were quantified, as previously described (25).
Briefly, for coculture experiments, BMSCs were seeded onto culture plates
overnight and MM cell lines were added to BMSC-coated plates the following day. Supernatants were harvested from 24-hour cultures.
Hif-1α functional analysis. Hif-1α transcription factor activity in MM
cells was determined with the TransAM Hif-1α kit (Active Motif) according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif). Briefly, Hif-1α dimers in
nuclear extracts specifically bind to an oligonucleotide containing the hypoxia-response element immobilized on a 96-well plate and are identified by
means of an anti–Hif-1α antibody. Wild-type (wt) consensus oligonucleotide was used as a competitor for Hif-1α binding to monitor the specificity
of the assay. The use of a mutated consensus oligonucleotide served as an
additional negative control. Nuclear extracts of CoCl2-stimulated COS-7 nuclear extracts were used as a positive control for Hif-1α activation.
DNA fragmentation assay. Cell death detection ELISAplus (Roche Applied Sciences) was used to quantitate DNA fragmentation, as per manufacturer's instructions.
Zebrafish angiogenesis assay. Zebrafish were bred and maintained as
described (26). Hemizygous transgenic tg(Fli1:eGFP)y1 embryos (27) were
kept in E3 buffer (5 mmol/L NaCl, 0.17 mmol/L KCl, 0.33 mmol/L CaCl2,
0.33 mmol/L MgSO4) at 28°C until gastrulation was completed. At 15 h post
fertilization (hpf), embryos were placed in E3 buffer containing PTU at a
final concentration of 0.2 mmol/L to prevent melanization with 0.5%
DMSO, 1 or 5 μmol/L adaphostin. At 44 hpf, embryos were washed with
fresh E3 buffer and analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM
510 META confocal microscope with a 20× Achroplan objective. The experiment was repeated five times with indicated numbers of embryos per
treatment group.

antibodies. Immunoblotting for ERK-2 confirmed equal protein loading.

Figure 2. Oncogenic c-Myc collaborates with Hif-1α in MM cells to mediate VEGF secretion. A, siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc is associated with Hif-1α
down-regulation. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with either nontargeting control (mock) siRNA (200 nmol/L) or c-Myc siRNA (200 nmol/L) and exposed to
CoCl2 (100 μmol/L), followed by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. Immunoblotting for actin confirmed equal protein loading. B, siRNA-mediated knockdown
of c-Myc inhibits Hif-1α promoter activity. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with either nontargeting control (mock) siRNA or c-Myc siRNA together with
either empty vector pGL3, 3× wt (3×HRE), or mutated HIF-response elements (3×HREmut) and a minimal promoter. Transfection mixes also contained a plasmid
encoding Renilla luciferase for normalization. Luciferase activity was measured after 18 h. Columns, averages from triplicate experiments; bars, SE. C, transient
transfection of c-Myc siRNA specifically decreases Hif-1α binding activity. Specific binding of Hif-1α dimers in nuclear extracts to HRE-containing oligonucleotides
immobilized on a 96-well plate was inhibited by transient transfection with c-Myc siRNA. Wt consensus oligonucleotide (wt-oligo) served as a competitor for Hif-1α
binding to monitor the specificity of the assay. The use of a mutated consensus oligonucleotide (mut-oligo) served as an additional negative control. The assay was
performed on samples transiently transfected with nontargeting control (mock) siRNA and c-Myc siRNA, respectively. D, siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc and
Hif-1α down-regulate VEGF secretion. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with 200 nmol/L of mock siRNA, c-Myc siRNA, or Hif-1α siRNA. Supernatants were
collected after 18 h and analyzed for VEGF protein by ELISA. Columns, mean absorbance of quadruplicate cultures; bars, SD.

In vitro angiogenesis assay. The antiangiogenic potential of adaphostin was studied using an in vitro angiogenesis assay kit (CHEMICON), as
per manufacturer's instructions. Tube formation was assessed using an
inverted light/fluorescence microscope at 4× to 10× magnification. Photographs are representative of each group and three independent experiments.
Xenograft mouse model. Beige-nude Xid mice were inoculated s.c. with
3 × 107 MM.1S MM cells in 100 μL RPMI 1640, together with 100 μL Matrigel
(BD Biosciences; ref. 28). When tumor was measurable, mice were assigned
to the adaphostin treatment group or a control group. Adaphostin was dissolved in PEG 300 and given twice per week by i.p. injection. The control
group received the carrier alone at the same schedule and route of administration. Tumor burden was measured every alternate day using a caliper
[calculated volume = 4π/3 × (width / 2)2 × (length / 2)]. Animals were sacrificed when their tumor reached 2 cm or when the mice became moribund.
Overall survival (OS) in animal studies was measured using the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank method. Results are presented as the median OS, with 95%
confidence intervals. All animal studies were approved by the Dana-Farber
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Immunohistochemistry. Four-micron-thick sections of formalin-fixed
tissue were used for TUNEL staining and staining with CD31 antibody
(BD Pharmingen) in a humid chamber at room temperature, as in prior
studies (11). For image capturing, the LEICA DMIL microscope was
connected to a Leica DFC 300FX digital camera and exported to Leica
IM50 Image Manager Software. Leica N Plan 5×/0.12 PH0, Leica N Plan

10×/0.25 PH1, and Leica HCX PL Fluotar 40×/0.60 corr PH2 XT objective
lenses were used.
Microarray analysis and statistics. Expression data for plasma cells
derived from healthy donors and from 65 MM patients were derived from
a study by Carrasco and colleagues (29). For the survival analysis, data were
derived from a study by Zhan and colleagues (ref. 30; see Supplementary
Fig. S2 for a detailed description of methodologies used).

Results
Drug-induced down-regulation of c-Myc is associated with
decreases of constitutively elevated Hif-1α levels in MM. While
Hif-1α inhibits physiologic c-Myc activity, it collaborates with
oncogenic c-Myc to induce VEGF expression in a variety of cancer cells (18, 19). However, the functional relationship of c-Myc
and Hif-1α in MM and BM angiogenesis, as well as its potential
as a target for novel and investigative anti-MM agents, is unknown. We therefore first screened conventional and novel anti-MM agents for their ability to decrease c-Myc and Hif-1α
levels.
Our results show strong down-regulation of both c-Myc and Hif1α after a low-dose and short-time treatment with bortezomib,
doxorubicin, and adaphostin (20, 21, 31), as well as moderate
down-regulation triggered by a low-dose treatment with PKC

inhibitor enzastaurin (32–35) and the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide (36). In contrast, no changes of c-Myc and Hif-1α protein levels were observed after treatment with dexamethasone or
melphalan (Fig. 1A). We chose adaphostin as a representative drug,
which down-regulates c-Myc and Hif-1α to further delineate potential c-Myc/Hif-1α–associated molecular sequelae. To validate
our data obtained in MM.1S cells, we first tested c-Myc and
Hif-1α protein levels in other MM cell lines (OPM1, OPM2,
NCI-H929, RPMI8226, KMS12) and primary MM cells before and
after treatment. High baseline c-Myc and Hif-1α levels were confirmed in all MM cell lines and primary MM cells investigated.
Moreover, treatment with adaphostin, at doses as low as 1
μmol/L, significantly reduced both c-Myc and Hif-1α levels (Fig.
1B), without affecting overall cell survival at these early time points
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Taken together, our data show that lowdose conventional, novel, and investigational agents, including
adaphostin, induce decreased c-Myc and Hif-1α in MM cells.
Oncogenic c-Myc collaborates with Hif-1α to trigger VEGF
production and secretion. To evaluate the functional interrelation of c-Myc and Hif-1α in MM, we next transfected MM.1S cells
with a pool of siRNA directed against c-Myc and tested for Hif-1α
expression. As a control, cells were treated with hypoxia-mimicking CoCl2 (100 μmol/L), which increased baseline levels of Hif-1α.
In contrast to previous reports, which show Hif-1α–dependent cMyc regulation (37–39), our results show that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of c-Myc is associated with decreased Hif-1α protein

levels, both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2A). Despite these decreased protein levels, no change was observed in
cell survival or proliferation at this early time point (data not
shown). Consequently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc induced significant down-regulation of Hif-1α–dependent HRE promoter activity. The empty vector pGL3, as well as a construct
carrying mutated 3× HRE, served as a negative control (Fig.
2B). Moreover, nuclear Hif-1α/HRE binding and Hif-1α activity
was determined upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc.
Our results show that knockdown of c-Myc decreases Hif-1α
binding and activity. Assay specificity was monitored by incubating nuclear extracts with a wt consensus oligonucleotide as a
competitor and a mutated consensus oligonucleotide, respectively. Indeed, decreased Hif-1α activation was observed using the wt
consensus oligonucleotide, but not the mutated consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that baseline expression
of Hif-1α in MM cells is c-Myc dependent but additional mechanisms contribute to hypoxia-dependent Hif-1α up-regulation.
As expected, siRNA-mediated knockdown of both c-Myc and
Hif-1α significantly decreased production and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a common Hif-1α target
gene and most potent angiogenic factor (Fig. 2D). Taken together,
our results indicate a role for c-Myc in maintaining high baseline
levels of Hif-1α protein and associated VEGF production and
secretion. This is also consistent with our finding (Fig. 1A)
that dexamethasone and melphalan fail to regulate c-Myc

Figure 3. Adaphostin-induced down-regulation of Hif-1α is c-Myc dependent. A, Hif-1α is a downstream target of c-Myc. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected
with nontargeting control (mock) siRNA or either c-Myc siRNA (200 nmol/L; top) or Hif-1α siRNA (200 nmol/L; bottom). After 10 h, these cells were treated with
adpahostin (1 μmol/L) or left untreated for an additional 8 h and then immunoblotted with Hif-1α and c-Myc. Immunoblotting for ERK-2 confirmed equal protein loading.
B, transient transfection of c-Myc siRNA or Hif-1α siRNA does not compromise MM cell growth. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with nontargeting control
(mock) siRNA, c-Myc siRNA (200 nmol/L), or Hif-1α siRNA (200 nmol/L), followed by a 3H[dT] uptake assay. C, overexpression of wt-c-Myc rescues down-regulation of
Hif-1α induced by siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc. At 8 h after transient transfection with c-Myc–specific siRNA (200 nmol/L), MM cells were transfected
with a plasmid carrying wt c-Myc. After an additional 10 h, cell lysates were immunoblotted with Hif-1α and c-Myc. Immunoblotting for ERK-2 confirmed equal protein
loading. D, adaphostin inhibits Hif-1α promoter activity and decreases Hif-1α binding activity. MM.1S and OPM2 cells transiently transfected with either empty
vector pGL3, 3× HIF response elements and a minimal promoter (3×HRE), or mutated 3× HIF response elements and a minimal promoter (3×HREmut) were treated with
adaphostin (1 μmol/L, 8 h). Transfection mixes also contained a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase for normalization. Luciferase activity was measured after 18 h.
Columns, averages from triplicate experiments (top graph); bars, SE. Specific binding of Hif-1α dimers in nuclear extracts to HRE-containing oligonucleotides
immobilized on a 96-well plate was inhibited by adaphostin (1 μmol/L). Wt consensus oligonucleotide (wt-oligo) was used as a competitor for Hif-1α binding to monitor
the specificity of the assay. The use of a mutated consensus oligonucleotide (mut-oligo) served as an additional negative control (bottom graph).

Figure 4. Defining the antiangiogenic activity
of adaphostin in the MM microenvironment.
A, MM cell–BM stromal cell adhesion–induced
Hif-1α is inhibited by adaphostin. Lysates of
adaphostin-treated and untreated MM.1S cells or
MM.1S cells cocultured with BMSCs were analyzed
by immunoblotting with antibodies against Hif-1α
and c-Myc. Immunoblotting for ERK-2 confirmed
equal protein loading. B, MM cell–BMSC
adhesion–induced VEGF secretion is inhibited by
adaphostin. MM.1S cells were cultured in control
medium alone or with the indicated concentrations
of adaphostin in the presence or absence of
BMSCs. Supernatants were collected after
18 h and analyzed for VEGF protein by ELISA.
C, adaphostin-induced inhibition of endothelial
tubule formation. Endothelial cell suspensions
were premixed 1:1 with supernatants from
experiment in B and EGM-2 and added on top of
the ECMatrix. Tubule formation was assessed
using an inverted light microscope at 4× to 10×
magnification. The branching points of endothelial
tubule were counted independently by two
individuals in several random view fields per
well, values were averaged, and statistically
significant differences were measured using the
Student's t test (left). Photographs of tubule
formation are representative of each group and
three independent experiments (right).

and Hif-1α protein levels, both of which are weak inhibitors of
angiogenesis.
Adaphostin-induced down-regulation of Hif-1α is c-Myc dependent. Our data show that c-Myc regulates Hif-1α protein levels. Specifically, transient knockdown of c-Myc down-regulates
Hif-1α protein levels (Fig. 3A, top graph). In contrast, transient
knockdown of Hif-1α does not affect c-Myc protein levels (Fig.
3A, bottom graph). Importantly, the rate of proliferation under
these conditions was not compromised (Fig. 3B). Transfection of
a plasmid carrying wt c-Myc 8 hours after siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc rescued decreases in Hif-1α levels, further showing
that Hif-1α is downstream of c-Myc (Fig. 3C). Similar to Hif-1α
down-regulation triggered by c-Myc knockdown, treatment of
MM.1S and OPM.2 MM cells with low-dose adaphostin (1 μmol/
L) inhibits Hif-1α–dependent HRE− promoter activity. The empty
vector pGL3, as well as a construct carrying mutated 3× HRE,
served as a negative control (Fig. 3D, top graph). Moreover, our results show that, similar to knockdown of c-Myc, adaphostin specifically decreases Hif-1α binding and activity (Fig. 3D, bottom graph).
Taken together, these data are consistent with a model of c-Myc–
dependent decreases of Hif-1α protein levels and support the potential to therapeutically target this relationship.
Defining the antiangiogenic activity of adaphostin in MM.
We next sought to translate these effects in a preclinical in vitro
MM model. Given that VEGF production and secretion is increased
in cocultures of MM cells with BMSCs (40), we investigated whether adhesion of MM cells to stromal cells modulates c-Myc
and Hif-1α protein levels. Our results show that Hif-1α levels are
significantly elevated upon binding of MM cells to BMSCs (Fig. 4A).
Similar to hypoxia, additional c-Myc–independent mechanisms
contribute to the regulation of Hif-1α levels in MM cells, as
evidenced by increased Hif-1α but not c-Myc expression when cocultured with BMSCs. By decreasing c-Myc and Hif-1α levels in the
cocultures, adaphostin inhibits VEGF production and secretion

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (12). June 15, 2009

triggered by MM cell binding to BMSCs (Fig. 4B). Consistent with
these results, tubule formation stimulated with supernatants derived from the experiment in Fig. 4B (5 hours) was markedly inhibited by adaphostin (Fig. 4C).
In summary, inhibition of c-Myc–dependent Hif-1α levels by
adaphostin in the BM microenvironment is followed by decreased
production and secretion of VEGF, the key growth factor for endothelial cells.
Validating the antiangiogenic activity of adaphostin in a
zebrafish model. To further confirm the antiangiogenic activity
of our tool compound, adaphostin, in vivo, we additionally used
an established zebrafish model (Danio rerio). When compared with
the rabbit cornea and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays, the zebrafish model shows equal capacities to discriminate
antiangiogenic compounds more rapidly at 24 to 48 h with higher
screening capacity. The most important advantage of performing
studies of angiogenesis in the zebrafish is its high transparency
and the availability of tg(Fli1:eGFP)y1 embryos with enhanced green
fluorescent protein expression in endothelial cells lining the blood
vessels (27, 41, 42). The zebrafish angiogenesis assay is based on the
real-time evaluation of blood vessel formation in a live zebrafish
embryo. At 24 hpf, the major vessels (dorsal aorta, posterior cardinal vein) are formed by vasculogenesis. Subsequently, the intersegmental vessels (ISV), parachordal vessels (PAV), and the dorsal
longitudinal anastomotic vessels (DLAV) develop along the trunk
by sprouting angiogenesis. Hemizygous tg(Fli1:eGFP)y1 embryos
(27, 41, 42) at 15 hpf were treated for 30 hours with adaphostin at
doses as low as 1 and 5 μmol/L or DMSO. Our results show significant concentration-dependent inhibition of vessel formation, particularly the PAVs, DLAVs, and ISVs, predominantly in the anterior
trunk of the fish, whereas the formation of the major blood vessels
was unaffected. These observations indicate that adaphostin selectively mediates inhibition of angiogenic vessel sprouting, because
the formation of other tissues seems intact (Fig. 5; Supplementary

model (42–44).
Activity of adaphostin using a MM xenograft mouse model.
Finally, we sought to translate the antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects of adaphostin in a preclinical model of MM. Immunedeficient beige-nude-xid mice were inoculated s.c. with 3 × 107
MM.1S cells and randomized into a control and a treatment (10
mg/kg) group. When tumors reached a palpable size, adaphostin
was given i.p. weekly over a 6-week period and then maintained until tumor size required sacrifice. Tumor growth was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 6A) in adaphostin-treated mice versus
control mice. Using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis, the mean
OS was 21 days in the control cohort versus 63 days in the treatment group. Statistically significant prolongation in mean OS was
observed in treated animals compared with control mice (P = 0.006;
Fig. 6B). Neither treatment with the vehicle alone nor adaphostin
affected the animals' body weight (Fig. 6C). Consistent with data
obtained in the zebrafish, tumor angiogenesis was markedly reduced within tumors of adaphostin-treated versus nontreated mice,

as evidenced by CD31 staining of tumors at day 21. Concomitantly,
c-Myc, Hif-1α, and VEGF expression were decreased (Fig. 6D, IHC).
After treatment discontinuation, there was a rapid increase of tumor angiogenesis, expression of c-Myc, Hif-1α, and VEGF (Fig. 6D,
IHC and right top graph), as well as tumor growth (Fig. 6D, right bottom graph) determined at day 32 after stopping treatment. These
data support a key role of tumor angiogenesis in MM and further
show that inhibition of angiogenesis contributes to the previously
reported anti-MM activity of adaphostin (22).
Interestingly, the HIF1A gene encoding Hif-1α showed a significant increased expression (P = 0.02, Mann-Whitney test) in tumor
cells versus plasma cells derived from healthy donors (29). In several
samples, HIF1A showed a lower expression than the healthy
controls, whereas a subset showed high levels of expression. When
the association of HIF1A overexpression with prognosis was tested
on a published data set of 559 MM patients (30), a significant link
between HIF1A overexpression and poor prognosis was found (P =
0.0069; Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). These data further point to
the possible relevance of HIF1A and, eventually, the activation of
general hypoxic mechanisms in the progression of a subset of MM

patients. Because HIF1A does not reside within regions of amplification and has not been previously implicated in chromosomal translocations in MM, other mechanisms of overexpression might be
active in MM cells.
Taken together, these results strongly support a pivotal role for
Hif-1α in MM pathogenesis. Moreover, these mechanisms may also play a role in other malignancies. Indeed, similar to MM, Hif1α levels are increased in a variety of other tumors, including
colon, breast, gastric, lung, skin, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate,
and renal carcinomas, and are associated with increased patient
mortality (14).

Discussion
Complex karyotypic abnormalities of the c-myc locus have been
reported in MM cell lines and in nearly 40% of MM cells from

patients with advanced disease (7). A key role for c-Myc in MM
pathogenesis has been proposed (8, 9). However, functional mechanisms of c-Myc mediating disease progression are not fully elucidated, and a role of c-Myc in triggering MM BM angiogenesis
may be one contributing factor (5, 6, 10).
Here, we show a link between oncogenic c-Myc and Hif-1α
expression, VEGF production, and poor prognosis in MM patients.
Specifically, c-Myc and Hif-1α are elevated in all MM cells, even
under normoxic conditions. We have, therefore, screened for a
compound that targets Hif-1α and shown that adaphostin, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and enzastaurin decrease Hif-1α levels and
VEGF, dependent on c-Myc. Drug-induced decreases in c-Myc
and/or Hif-1α levels have also been previously observed in response to 2ME2, 17-AAG, and pazopanib, which are antiangiogenic
and effective in MM and/or other solid and hematologic malignancies (11, 33, 45–49).

c-Myc and Hif-1α in Multiple Myeloma

Functionally, the particular novelty of our data is the demonstration that Hif-1α protein level and activity in MM cells under
normoxic conditions is regulated by oncogenic c-Myc to influence
VEGF secretion and angiogenic activity. Our findings are consistent with previous studies in other tumor models showing that oncogenic c-Myc collaborates with Hif-1α to induce the expression of
VEGF (angiogenesis; refs. 5, 6, 10, 18, 19) but in contrast to previous
reports that show Hif-1α–dependent c-Myc regulation (37–39). In
ongoing studies, we are investigating both c-Myc–dependent molecular mechanisms, which regulate the maintenance of Hif-1α levels in the MM cell, including transcriptional, translational, and
posttranslational modifications, as well as initial events leading
to drug (e.g., adaphostin)–induced decreases of c-Myc and Hif1α. Of note, although adaphostin induces ROS release in MM cells,
pretreatment with PDTC did not abrogate adaphostin-induced
down-regulation of c-Myc and Hif-1α. These results, therefore, exclude the possibility that adaphostin-induced effects on c-Myc and
Hif-1α are due to protein degradation (data not shown).
After defining a role of c-Myc and Hif-1α in in vitro MM BM
models, we subsequently validated the in vivo antiangiogenic activity of our tool compound, adaphostin (20), using the zebrafish
model. Indeed, adaphostin inhibits these sequelae, showing specificity in blocking angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos when used in
low doses. To further enhance the clinical relevance of this model,
we are now establishing a xenograft zebrafish model for MM,
similar to those previously described for other cancers (50). Importantly, adaphostin showed efficacy in a clinically relevant in vivo
murine xenograft model of human MM, which has predicted the
utility of other novel therapies in MM.

Taken together, our studies delineate a new c-Myc/Hif-1α–dependent pathway, which triggers the release of VEGF and the induction of MM angiogenesis and support the hypothesis that
oncogenic c-Myc triggers MM progression, at least in part, by modulation of tumor angiogenesis. We, therefore, identify a pivotal role
for c-Myc and Hif-1α in MM pathogenesis and provide the framework for clinical trials of new agents, which decrease c-Myc and
Hif-1α in MM cells and their BM microenvironment.
