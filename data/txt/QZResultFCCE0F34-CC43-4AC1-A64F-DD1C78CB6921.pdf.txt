SUMMARY
Author Manuscript

We recently reported that atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) comprise at least two
transcriptional subtypes with different clinical outcomes; however, the mechanisms underlying
therapeutic heterogeneity remained unclear. In this study, we analyzed 191 primary ATRTs and 10
ATRT cell lines to define the genomic and epigenomic landscape of ATRTs and identify subgroupspecific therapeutic targets. We found ATRTs segregated into three epigenetic subgroups with
distinct genomic profiles, SMARCB1 genotypes, and chromatin landscape that correlated with
differential cellular responses to a panel of signaling and epigenetic inhibitors. Significantly, we
discovered that differential methylation of a PDGFRB-associated enhancer confers specific
sensitivity of group 2 ATRT cells to dasatinib and nilotinib, and suggest that these are promising
therapies for this highly lethal ATRT subtype.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Rhabdoid tumors (RT) are highly malignant, multi-lineage neoplasms of early childhood
originally described in kidneys and soft tissues, but most frequently seen in the CNS where
they are called atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs). ATRTs were historically
considered incurable, and although outcomes have improved with intensified multimodal
therapy, most patients survive less than 1 year after diagnosis (Chi et al., 2008; Hilden, 2004;
Lafay-Cousin et al., 2012; Tekautz, 2005).

Author Manuscript

Biallelic SMARCB1 loss-of-function alterations are diagnostic of all RTs (Versteege et al.,
1998). Up to 35% of ATRTs patients have heritable SMARCB1 alterations, which
predispose to multiple RTs (Eaton et al., 2011). Indeed, Smarcb1+/− mice also develop softtissue- or neural-crest-derived RTs (Klochendler-Yeivin et al., 2000; Roberts et al., 2002),
and ATRTs can arise from conditional inactivation of Smarcb1 (Han et al., 2016).
SMARCB1 is a constitutive component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex,
which exhibits substantial structural and functional diversity during neurogenesis. Loss of
SMARCA4 (Hasselblatt et al., 2011), which encodes another component of the SWI/SNF
complex in some ATRTs, further underscores SWI/SNF-directed epigenetic mechanisms as
critical in ATRT development. Although cumulative data support a central role for
SMARCB1 in RT initiation, specific mechanisms driving tumor development remain
unclear. SMARCB1 deficiency leads to aberrant nucleosomal positioning by the SWI/SNF
complex and is associated with upregulation of EZH2, a histone methyl transferase of the
repressive PRC2 complex (Roberts and Orkin, 2004) with consequent deregulation of
multiple downstream signaling pathways. These observations have led to RT therapies
targeting EZH2 and other downstream pathways (Kim and Roberts, 2016; Wilson et al.,
2010).

Surprisingly, despite the highly malignant and heterogeneous nature of ATRTs, exome
studies indicate only recurrent SMARCB1 coding alterations (Johann et al., 2016; Lee et al.,
2012). We recently reported that ATRTs comprised at least two transcriptional subtypes with
different clinical phenotypes (Torchia et al., 2015). While group 1 ATRTs with neurogenic
signatures correlated with superior survival, group 2 ATRTs with mesenchymal signatures
had aggressive, treatment-resistant phenotypes and dismal outcomes. However, mechanisms
underlying varied therapeutic responses in ATRT patients remain unclear. Therefore, we
performed an integrated genomic and functional epigenomic analysis of a large cohort of
primary tumors and cell lines to elucidate subgroup-specific therapeutic sensitivities in
ATRT.

ATRTs Comprise Three Epigenetic Subtypes with Distinct Clinical Profiles and Genotypes

Author Manuscript

We integrated whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), highresolution copy number profiling, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses with gene
expression and methylation profiling on a total of 191 primary tumors (Table S1). Consistent
with prior studies, coding region single-nucleotide variation (SNV) rate was low with only
recurrent SMARCB1 coding mutations (Figure 1A, Table S2). However, intergenic mutation
rate was significantly higher (0.64 mutation/Mb), suggesting that non-coding alterations may
be important in ATRT (Figure 1A). Interestingly, we identified a spectrum of 379 copy
number alterations (CNAs), including whole-arm gains and losses, focal deletions,
duplications, and complex inter- and intrachromosomal gene rearrangements and uncovered
1.84–3.57 structural alterations/ATRT (Figure 1B; Tables S2 and S3). Cell adhesion, neural
development, and chromatin-remodeling genes were targeted by recurrent coding region
CNAs in up to 20% of ATRTs (Table S4) (Figure S1), and SMARCB1 lacked previously
reported mutational hotspots (Bourdeaut et al., 2011; Jackson et al., 2009). Notably,
SMARCB1 loss in 55.8% of ATRTs analyzed arose from structural events including exon
duplications and gene fusions to HOR-MAD2 and GTPBP1 (Figures 1C–1E; Table S5),
indicating structural alterations as predominant mechanisms for SMARCB1 loss in ATRTs.

Unsupervised cluster analyses of 450k methylation micro-array data from 162 ATRTs
revealed three epigenetic classes with high concordance to gene expression subtypes
determined from 90 primary ATRTs (Figures 2A and 2B, S2A–S2E). While group 1 ATRTs
comprised a single methylation cluster, group 2 tumors further segregated into two
methylation subtypes (group 2A and 2B). ATRT subtypes correlated with distinct clinical
and genotypic features (Figures 2C and 2D; Table S6); group 1 and 2A tumors arose
predominantly in the supratentorial/cerebral (38/52; 73.1%) and infratentorial (cerebellum,
brain stem) (42/64; 65.6%) locations, respectively. Group 1 and 2A ATRTs were seen in the
oldest (median age 24 months; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.70–26.55) and youngest
(median age 12 months; 95% CI = 11.05–13.00) children, respectively. Group 2B ATRTs
encompassed more heterogeneous locations and included infra- (9/34; 26.5%), supratentorial
(17/34; 50.0%), and all spinal (8/34; 23.5%) tumors. Group 2B patients spanned a broader
age distribution and comprised the majority of patients older than 3 years of age (12/32;
37.5%). We found no significant subgroup association with gender or tumor metastases.

Although SNV alteration rates were comparable across subgroups, we observed genotypic
differences; group 2B tumors had more focal genomic alterations (mean = 1.83; 95% CI =
1.43–2.31 alterations/tumor; p = 0.0024) than group 1 (mean = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.65–1.12
alterations/tumor) and 2A (mean = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.68–1.13 alterations/tumor; Figures 2C
and Table S6) tumors. While group 1 tumors were distinguished by recurrent chr14 gains
and chr19 losses, group 2B tumors exhibited focal copy number losses across multiple
chromosomes, and group 2A ATRTs were genomically bland (Figure S3). Strikingly, our
analyses revealed the type of genetic event leading to SMARCB1 loss also differed between
ATRT subgroups (p = 2.79 × 10−4; Figure 2C; Table S6). Most group 1 tumors (30/45;
66.7%) exhibited focal/subgenic alterations with predicted retention of the SMARCB1
transcriptional start site; however, group 2B tumors had large deletions encompassing
SMARCB1 and frequently additional chr22 genes, thus indicating
SMARCB1genotype:phenotype correlations in ATRTs.

ATRT Subgroups Have Distinct Lineage-Enriched Functional Genomes

Our observation of specific genotypes suggests that SMARCB1 loss may have different
functional consequences in ATRT subtypes. To define core molecular and cellular features of
ATRT subgroups, we integrated supervised analyses of transcriptional and methylation data
and observed that, while ATRTs generally exhibited a hypermethylated genome relative to
other pediatric brain tumors, group 2A ATRTs had the lowest CpG island methylation levels
compared with group 1 and 2B tumors (Figure S4A). Distribution of differentially
methylated probes in CpG islands or gene bodies were similar across subgroups (Figure
S4B); however, methylation and expression levels of lineage and developmental signaling
genes differed significantly between subgroups (Figure 3A). These findings were
corroborated by ingenuity pathway analyses (Figure 3B; Table S7), which revealed
neurogenic genes (FABP7, ASCL1, MYCN, c1orf61) and genes involved in NOTCH
(DLL1/3 HES5/6), glutamate receptor (SLC17A8, SLC17A6), and axonal guidance
(TUBB2B/3/4A, SEMA6A) signaling, were most highly expressed and hypomethylated in
group 1 ATRTs. BMP signaling (BMP4, BAMBI, GDF5, FOXC1) and mesenchymal
differentiation (SERPINF1, CLDN10, FBN2, MSX1, PDGFRB) genes were most
differentially expressed and methylated in group 2A/B tumors (Figure 3C; Table S7). Group
2A tumors were further distinguished by enrichment of visual cortex/hindbrain development
(OTX2), retinol (RBP1, RBP7, RDH5, RDH10), and tyrosine (TYR) metabolism genes,
while upregulation of MYC and HOXB/C clusters was seen in group 2B tumors (Figure 3C).
Detailed analyses showed high concordance of CpG methylation patterns at promoters with
ATRT subtypes, thus suggesting epigenetic regulation of developmental/cell lineage
signaling pathways in ATRTs (Figures 3D and S5). Interestingly, while many group 2A
enriched genes had functions in pluripotency and EMT, group 2B ATRTs exhibited
heterogeneous profiles with enrichment of interferon signaling, cell adhesion, and
cytoskeletal genes (Figure 3B).
To further investigate the distinct functional epigenome of ATRT subgroups, we performed
high-resolution, genome-wide chromatin accessibility mapping using the assay for
transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses on five primary
tumors (two group 1 and 2A, one group 2B) and four ATRT cell lines. In keeping with

methylation and transcriptional analyses, principle component and correlation analysis of
primary ATRT ATAC-seq data showed segregation and association of ATRT subtypes with
distinct ATAC-seq profiles (Figure 4A; Table S8). Integration of ATAC-seq footprints with
RNA-seq data revealed open chromatin landscape in group 2A ATRTs that correlated with
generally increased gene expression patterns in contrast to more closed chromatin
landscapes and decreased gene expression patterns in group 1 tumors, while group 2B
ATRTs exhibited an intermediate profile (Figure 4B). Specifically, we observed that group 1
(ASCL1, FABP7) and group 2A/B (OTX2, ZIC1/4, ZIC5/2) cell lineage genes and multiple
signaling genes including ligands of NOTCH (DLL1, HES6) and BMP (BMP4, MSX2)
pathways displayed open chromatin in a subtype-specific pattern. ATAC-seq analyses of
ATRT cell lines showed similar patterns indicating that subgroup lineage and signaling
features were maintained in cell lines (Figures 4C and 4D). These data suggest that ATRT
subgroups and SMARCB1 genotypes correlate with distinct functional epigenomes and
indicate that epigenomic mechanisms drive lineage-specific gene expression and potential
targetable therapeutic pathways in ATRTs.
NOTCH and BMP Signaling Drive ATRT Subgroup-Specific Cell Growth

Author Manuscript

To investigate subtype-specific therapies, we used expression profiling to determine
molecular grouping of ten ATRT cell lines including 78C and 34C, respectively, derived
from tumors T13 (group 1), T45 (group 2B), and established lines CHLA02, CHLA04,
CHLA05, CHLA06, CHLA266, BT12, BT16, and SH. Prediction analysis of microarray
(PAM) analyses of gene expression data from primary ATRTs reproducibly classified cell
lines into subgroups 1 and 2 which, respectively, showed enrichment of neurogenic/NOTCH
and mesenchymal/BMP signaling genes seen in corresponding primary ATRT subtypes.
Western blot analyses confirmed expression of NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) and
phosphorylated SMAD1/5 (pSMAD1/5), respective effectors of NOTCH and BMP signaling
in primary group 1 and 2 ATRTs and corresponding cell lines (Figure 5A), indicating that
subtype signaling pathways were maintained.

Author Manuscript

To evaluate functional significance of NOTCH and BMP signaling, we used DAPT (N-[N(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester), a γ-secretase inhibitor
(Geling et al., 2002), and dorsomorphin (DM) (Yu et al., 2008) to, respectively, assess
effects of NOTCH and BMP inhibition on a panel of group 1 (78C, CHLA05, CHLA02) and
group 2A/B (SH, CHLA06, BT16) cell lines with most consistent growth phenotypes. Cell
viability assays showed robust dose-dependent growth inhibition of group 1 and 2 cell lines
with DAPT and DM treatment, respectively (Figures 5B and S6A), while cross-treatment of
group 1 and 2 cell lines respectively with DM and DAPT had insignificant growth effects.
Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses confirmed growth inhibition by DAPT correlated with
dose-dependent downregulation of NICD and NOTCH transcriptional targets HES1 and
HES5 in group 1 lines (Figures 5C and S6B). Similarly, we observed a dose-dependent
decrease in pSMAD1/5 and BMP target genes SOST and BAMBI in group 2 cell lines
(Figures 5D and S6B). Changes in NICD and pSMAD1/5 levels after DAPT and DM
treatments also correlated with increased cell death in TUNEL assays (Figure S6C). We
confirmed that the growth effects of γ-secretase inhibitors were mediated via NOTCH
signaling in group 1 cells using siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NOTCH effector RBPJ,

which significantly diminished growth of group 1 (CHLA04/05) but not group 2 cell lines
(BT12/BT16) (Figure 5E). These data collectively indicate that NOTCH and BMP are
important ATRT subgroup-specific survival pathways and attractive pharmacologic targets.
Epigenetic Regulation of an Enhancer Element Underlies Group 2 ATRT Sensitivity to
Pharmacologic Inhibitors of PDGFRB Signaling

Recent studies report promising therapies targeting various epigenetic and signaling
pathways in ATRTs (Ginn and Gajjar, 2012); however, the relevance of these agents to
ATRT subtypes is unknown as prior studies examined a few cell lines. To identify additional
subgroup-specific targets, we tested the effects of 14 small molecules targeting epigenetic
pathways on growth of three group 1 (CHLA04, 02, 05) and five group 2 ATRT
(CHLA266/06, SH, BT16/12) lines (Figure S7A). We selected small-molecule inhibitors
with well-defined in vitro cellular activity that target Bromo/BET domain proteins (JQ1,
PFI-1,2 GSK2801, SGC-CBP30), methyltransferases (GSK343, UNC1999, UNC0642,
UNC0638, A-366, J4, DOT1L, LLY507), and histone deacetylases (LAQ824). Cell viability
assays showed that five of the 14 compounds had consistent significant effects on cell
growth (>30% reduction in cell viability), including UNC0638, UNC1999, JQ1, LAQ824,
and J4. LAQ824 and J4 significantly diminished growth of all cell lines. In contrast,
UNC0638, UNC1999, and JQ1 treatment induced >30% reduction in viability of all three
group 1 cell lines but did not affect three out of five group 2 cell lines (Figures 6A, 6B, S7A,
and S7B). Interestingly, gene expression analyses showed that EHMT2 (encodes G9a),
EZH2, BRD4, and related loci (BRD1-BRD7) were highly expressed across all ATRTs (data
not shown), and suggest that therapeutic sensitivity to epigenetic inhibitors may be
dependent on a distinct functional chromatin landscape in ATRT subtypes.

Dasatinib and nilotinib are ATP-competitive small-molecule multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) of BCR-ABL fusion protein, stem cell factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), and Src family kinases (Rix et al., 2007). Both drugs are widely used in
treatment of leukemia (Kantarjian et al., 2006) and some solid tumors (Araujo and
Logothetis, 2010) but have not been extensively investigated in pediatric brain tumors. We
therefore tested the sensitivity of ATRT cell lines to dasatinib and nilotinib as gene
expression data indicated that PDGFRB was most differentially expressed between ATRT
subgroups. In contrast to the relative insensitivity of group 2 ATRTs to epigenetic inhibitors,
the growth of all five group 2 cell lines tested, including CHLA266 that was reported
previously to be dasatinib sensitive (Kolb et al., 2008), was robustly diminished after
dasatinib and nilotinib treatment (Figures 6A and 6B). Importantly, neither drug
significantly affected the growth of group 1 cell lines. The well-characterized pharmacology
of these drugs make them ideal candidates for clinical translation, hence we sought to further
investigate the pharmacologic properties and mechanisms underlying the robust effect of
both drugs on group 2 ATRT cell growth. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
assays revealed group 2 cell lines were up to 1,000 times more sensitive to dasatinib than
group 1 cell lines (IC50 range 1.01 ± 0.02 to 5.23 ± 0.13 μM versus 3.98 ± 0.90 to 49.95 nM
for group 1 and 2, respectively) (Figure 6C). As there are no reports of dasatinib efficacy in
brain tumors, we tested dasatinib treatment in vivo using a BT16 orthotopic xenograft model
which recapitulates classical rhabdoid morphology (Figure S7C) with predictable

engraftment rates. Mice with BT16 xenografts treated with daily intraperitoneal dasatinib
(30 mg/kg) injections for 2 weeks had significantly prolonged survival compared with
vehicle-treated controls (Figure 6D). Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of a subset of tumorbearing mice showed that drug treatment correlated significantly with decreased BLI signals
(p = 0.043; Figure 6D).

To investigate mechanisms for dasatinib sensitivity, we compared expression of known
dasatinib targets in ATRT subtypes. Integrated analyses identified PDGFRB as the most
significantly differentially expressed locus in group 2 versus group 1 ATRTs (>2-fold
change, p = 6.35 × 10−5) (Figure 6E), which was confirmed by western blot analyses of
primary ATRTs (Figure 6F). CSF1R, which also encodes a potential dasatinib/nilotinib
target and maps next to PDGFRB, was not differentially expressed or methylated in primary
tumors or cell lines. These findings suggested that differential epigenetic regulation leading
to PDGFRB upregulation may underlie the distinct sensitivity of group 2 cells to dasatinib
and nilotinib. Consistent with high PDGFRB expression in group 2 ATRTs, ATAC-seq
analyses revealed open chromatin at the PDGFRB but not the CSF1R promoter, specifically
in group 2 primary tumors and cell lines (Figures 7A and 7B). Interestingly, ATAC-seq
analyses also identified a distinct region of open chromatin in group 2 tumors and cell lines
that corresponded to a potential regulatory domain 50 kb upstream of the PDGFRB
promoter within exon 1 of CSF1R (chr5:149,491,285–149,493,716) (Figures 7A and 7B). To
examine whether juxtaposition of the PDGFRB promoter and putative enhancer by
chromatin looping underlies PDGFRB upregulation in group 2 ATRTs, we performed C3D
analyses on primary tumor ATAC-seq data to evaluate the probability of peak associations
(Thurman et al., 2012). The Pearson correlation co-efficient calculated for ATAC-seq peaks
within a 500 kb window of the PDGFRB promoter showed significant correlations between
the PDGFRB promoter and putative enhancer only in group 2 tumors, T26 (0.5170; p <
0.0001) and T27 (0.3028; p = 0.0067) (Figure 7C), and strongly supported direct interaction
of the PDGFRB promoter and putative enhancer specifically in group 2 ATRTs. Detailed
analyses of CSF1R and PDGFRB revealed hypomethylation of six CG residues within the
putative enhancer in group 2 tumors and cell lines that correlated significantly with
PDGFRB but not CSF1R expression (Figure 7D). Alignment with ENCODE data indicated
features characteristic of enhancers in this region (Filippova et al., 1996; Malik et al., 2014),
including differential H3KMe1, H3K4Me3, and H3K27Ac marks, and binding sites for
multiple transcription factors including Myc network proteins, FOS and CTCF (Figures 7A
and S8A). Together with the significant enrichment of MYC and FOS expression seen in
group 2 ATRTs (Figure S8B), these findings suggest that differential epigenetic regulation of
the putative enhancer underlies PDGFRB upregulation and distinct group 2 ATRT sensitivity
to dasatinib and nilotinib. To confirm and map the putative PDGFRB enhancer, we
performed H3K27Ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on two
dasatinib/nilotinib-resistant group 1 (CHLA04, 05) cell lines and a representative dasatinib/
nilotinib-sensitive group 2 (BT12) cell line. Peak analyses showed that enriched H3K27Ac
marks aligned with the predicted enhancer region only in group 2 lines, indicating enhancer
activity only in group 2 ATRT cells (Figure 7B). 3C analyses revealed co-enrichment of
probes mapping to the PDGFRB enhancer and promoter regions in BT12 and CHLA05 cells
(Figure 8A). Of note, a second peak in the PDGFRB gene body was not associated with

H3K27Ac enrichment in BT12 cells. Taken together with the enrichment of H3K27Ac
marks at the putative PDGFRB enhancer in BT12 but not CHLA04 and 05 cells, these data
indicate that direct interaction of a distant active enhancer and promoter via chromatin
looping facilitates PDGRB expression in group 2 ATRT cells (Figure 8B). Consistent with
these observations, western blot analyses showed high phospho-PDGFRB (pPDGFRB)
expression in group 2, but not group 1 ATRT cell lines (Figure 8C), and robust
downregulation of pPDGFRB after dasatinib treatment in group 2 cells (Figure 8D).
Collectively, our results suggest that epigenetic regulation via differential methylation of a
PDGFRB-associated enhancer specifically drives the sensitivity of group 2 ATRTs to smallmolecule inhibitors of the PDGFRB signaling axis and indicate that dasatinib/nilotinib are
important agents for the particularly lethal group 2 ATRTs.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

ATRTs are highly malignant cancers with substantial heterogeneity in disease presentation
and poorly defined biology for which best therapeutic approaches are undefined. Here, we
demonstrate that ATRTs comprise three epigenetic subtypes that correlate with distinct
tumor locations, patient age, lineage-enriched methylation and transcriptional signatures,
and unique global and SMARCB1-specific genotypes. Our data reveal that ATRT subgroups
are associated with a distinct epigenomic landscape and sensitivity to inhibitors of NOTCH,
BMP, PDGFRB, and epigenetic signaling. Significantly, we discovered that differential
methylation of a PDGFRB enhancer underlies the robust and distinct sensitivity of group 2
ATRTs to dasatinib and nilotinib, two well-characterized and widely used cancer drugs.

Cumulative studies indicate that a convergence of epigenomic features reflecting cellular
origins and specific somatic alterations underlies diverse tumor phenotypes (Feinberg et al.,
2006). Here, we observed that ATRTs segregate into subtypes with specific lineage-enriched
methylation signatures, distinct tumor location, and age of presentation suggestive of origins
from different neural progenitors. In the predominantly supratentorial group 1 ATRTs, we
observed distinct methylation and enrichment of neurogenic loci including forebrain markers
LHX2 (Roy et al., 2014) and MEIS2 (Cecconi et al., 1997), as well as FABP7 and ASCL1,
markers of radial glial neural progenitors (Anthony et al., 2004), indicating these as potential
cell of origins for group 1 ATRTs. In contrast, differentially methylated and expressed loci in
group 2 ATRTs were primarily mesenchymal lineage/signaling (BMP/PDGFRB) and mid/
hindbrain development (ZIC1, -2, -4, -5, OTX2, HOXB/C) genes and suggest that group
2A/B ATRTs, which are primarily infratentorial and spinal tumors, develop from mid/
hindbrain neural progenitors. Enrichment of neuronal development pathways in group 1
tumors contrasted with a dominance of stem cell differentiation and pluripotency pathways
in group 2A ATRTs. We also observed that, in contrast to group 1 and 2B, group 2A tumors
were associated with global CpG island hypomethylation, a more open chromatin landscape
and overall increased gene expression patterns reminiscent of more primitive cell types.
These data further suggest that group 2A tumors, which arise in the youngest patients (12.00
months 95% CI = 11.05–13.00), originate from highly primitive neural precursors. Our
findings corroborate a recent study that also reported three epigenetic subtypes of ATRTs
with distinct enhancer landscapes (Johann et al., 2016), and a study of murine ATRTs
derived from a conditional ROSA-Cre model (Han et al., 2016). Our data revealed that

ATRTs have rare coding mutations but exhibit subtype-enriched patterns of CNAs and
SMARCB1 genotypes, and suggest different mechanisms of tumor initiation and
progression in ATRT subtypes. Notably SMARCB1 deletions in group 2B ATRTs were
frequently accompanied by copy number-driven gene expression changes in candidate
modifier loci with neurogenic and epigenetic functions, including BCR, MKL, and EP300
(Kaartinen et al., 2001).

As ATRTs lack other recurrent coding alterations, there has been substantial interest in
epigenetic therapies for ATRTs. Specifically, promising studies of EZH2 (Knutson et al.,
2013) and BET domain (Tang et al., 2014) inhibitors have been reported. Intriguingly, while
our screen of small epigenetic inhibitors confirmed the therapeutic effects of UNC1999 and
JQ1, respectively EZH2 and BET domain inhibitors, we observed growth inhibitory effects
predominantly in group 1 lines. Similarly, we observed that only group 1 lines were sensitive
to UNC0638, a chemical compound for histone methyl transferase G9a, while LAQ824, a
histone acetylase inhibitor, diminished growth in all cell lines. These findings may reflect
more general epigenetic functions of histone deacetylases versus histone methyl
transferases. Interestingly, the cellular responses to epigenetic compounds overlapped with
the sensitivity to inhibitors of NOTCH and BMP signaling pathways, critical mediators of
lineage-specific progenitor cell survival (Ericson et al., 1998). Specifically, group 1 cells
with neurogenic transcriptional and epigenomic profiles were sensitive to DAPT, UNC0638,
and UNC1999, while group 2 cell lines with limited features of neural differentiation were
largely insensitive to these three inhibitors. In contrast, we observed a distinct sensitivity of
group 2 cell lines to inhibitors of BMP and PDGFRB, both mediators of mesenchymal
signaling. Of note, recent reports indicate a functional and physical interaction of the
G9a/GLP and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetic silencing machineries and
co-regulation of neuronal developmental genes by G9a and PRC2 (Mozzetta et al., 2014).
These observations collectively indicate that lineage-associated epigenomic landscapes of
ATRTs have critical implications for the development of ATRT subtype-specific therapies.
Future investigations to define contributions of other epigenetic modifiers implicated by our
genomic and experimental data will clearly be important for informing the development of
ATRT therapies.

Our data extend an earlier report of PDGFRA/B expression in some ATRTs and rhabdoid
tumor sensitivity to TKIs (Koos et al., 2010). Here, we observed that nilotinib and dasatinib
have growth inhibitory effects only in group 2 ATRT cells, including the CHLA266 cell line
reported previously to be dasatinib sensitive (Kolb et al., 2008). Importantly, our studies
show that dasatinib significantly prolongs the survival of mice with orthotopic group 2
ATRT xenografts, thus indicating that dasatinib can accumulate at a sufficient concentration
for tyrosine kinase inhibition in brain tumors. Our studies also suggest that PDGFRB
expression is a promising biomarker for dasatinib sensitivity in ATRTs. These findings have
significant implications for ATRT treatment as the safety and efficacy of dasatinib are
established in adults and children. Interestingly, consistent with the reported enrichment of
BMP signaling/mesenchymal lineage genes in non-CNS RTs (Birks et al., 2011; Chun et al.,
2016; Gadd et al., 2010), we observed an overlap in the methylation profiles of non-CNS
RTs and group 2 ATRTs (data not shown), which suggests that some group 2 ATRTs and
non-CNS tumors characteristically seen in very young children with rhabdoid predisposition

syndrome, may have common or closely related cellular origins. Indeed, we observed that
dasatinib and nilotinib also robustly inhibited the growth of G401, a renal RT cell line (data
not shown) and suggest potential roles for dasatinib and nilotinib in non-CNS RT treatment.

Despite evidence of a critical etiologic role for SMARCB1 in RT initiation, the pathobiology
of ATRTs remains poorly elucidated. Our data suggest that SMARCB1 loss via diverse
mechanisms in different cellular contexts, together with additional epigenetic and genetic
events, underlies the clinical heterogeneity of human ATRTs. These observations have
significant implications for the fundamental understanding and targeting of SWI/SNF
function in neoplastic growth and clinical management of ATRTs. Specifically, our analyses,
which reveal a spectrum of alterations throughout SMARCB1, indicate that current
diagnostic methods may underestimate the frequency of SMARCB1 alterations in ATRTs.
We have identified known and potential drugs and drug-like inhibitors with different
therapeutic effects in molecular subtypes of ATRTs. In addition to nominating dasatinib and
nilotinib as promising repurposed drugs for ATRTs, our comprehensive characterization of
ATRT cell lines provides a rich resource for the further development of other candidate
ATRT drugs. Most importantly, our study underscores the significant limitations of current
chemoradiotherapeutic regimens used uniformly for all ATRT patients. Together with our
earlier observations that indicate differential outcomes for molecular subtypes of ATRTs, our
study provides a critical framework for informing pre-clinical studies as well as risk- and
biology-stratified clinical trials for ATRTs.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Tumor and Patient Information

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

All tumors and clinical information were collected through an international collaborative
network (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) with consent as per protocols
approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Board at participating institutions. In total, 194
CNS (191 primary and 3 recurrent) and 9 non-CNS RT samples were collected for genomic
analyses (Table S3). All ATRTs were diagnosed according to the World Health Organization
CNS tumor classification criteria (Louis and Wiestler, 2007) and confirmed by BAF47
immunostains (BD Biosciences, catalog no. 612110). Biallelic SMARCB1 alterations were
confirmed using FISH, MLPA, targeted exons 1–9 Sanger sequencing, or WGS/WES
analyses. DNA or RNA from snap frozen tumor were investigated with one or more of
WGS/WES, RNA-seq and high-resolution copy number/SNP, gene expression, and
methylation array analyses; 123 samples with DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
materials were analyzed with the Illumina 450k methylation arrays. Animal studies were
conducted in accordance with the policies and regulations for ethical treatment of animals
approved for the Toronto Center for Phenogenomics.
Statistical Analyses
Difference in nucleotide transition/transversion rates from WGS SNV calls were determined
using the two-proportion Z test with Yates’ correction for continuity. Significance of
differences in gender, location, metastasis, and individual genomic loci between ATRT
subgroups were analyzed using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test. The Kruskal-Wallis test was

used to assess the significance of tumor subgroups in relation to age and counts of genomic
alterations. Student’s t test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test with false discovery rate
(FDR) correction were used, respectively, to test for differences in gene expression and
methylation between groups. All analyses were conducted in the R statistical environment
(v2.15.2) or with SPSS version 22.0. A p value of <0.05 was regarded as significant for all
analyses.

Significance
ATRTs are considered to be genetically homogeneous with bland genomes. Our
integrated genomic studies indicate a higher non-coding mutation rate and predominantly
structural coding alterations, which suggest a more complex ATRT genome. We identify
three epigenetic ATRT subtypes associated with distinct genotypic, chromatin, and
functional landscapes that correlate with cellular responses to various signaling and
epigenetic pathway inhibitors. Significantly, we identify two well-characterized cancer
drugs, dasatinib and nilotinib, as promising therapeutic agents for group 2 ATRTs.
Together with our earlier findings, our data provide compelling rationale for the
development of a risk- and biology-stratified trial for ATRTs.
