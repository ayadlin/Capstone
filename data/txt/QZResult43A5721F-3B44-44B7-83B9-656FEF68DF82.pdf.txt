ABSTRACT
Flavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds and are among the most
promising anticancer agents. Here, we demonstrate that the flavonoid astragalin (AG),
also known as kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucoside, induces cell death. This was prevented
by the caspase inhibitors z-DEVD-FMK and z-LEHD-FMK. AG-induced cell death was
associated with an increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and amplified by the inhibition of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and Akt signaling. Meanwhile, AG
suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Additional studies revealed that AG inhibited
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-induced NF-κB activity. AG also potentiated TNFαinduced apoptosis in A549 cells. Furthermore, using a mouse xenograft model, we
demonstrated that AG suppressed tumor growth and induced cancer cell apoptosis in vivo.
Taken together, these results suggest that AG may be a promising cancer therapeutic
drug that warrants further investigation into its potential clinical applications.

extrinsic pathways, caspase-3 is in charge of the cleavage of
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) during apoptosis [2].
Apoptosis is an intricate process; it is mediated by a number
of molecules that work to either inhibit (including Bcl-xl, Bcl2, and the IAP family of proteins) or promote (such as Bak,
Bax, and caspases) cell death [3]. A common phenomenon of
many cancers is defective apoptosis, which is also a key factor
in tumorigenesis as well as in treatment resistance; therefore,
apoptotic pathways are often targets of cancer therapies.
Cancer is still the main cause of mortality globally.
Despite advances in the development of new therapeutic
options for cancer, chemotherapy is still the fundamental
tool for cancer treatment; it functions primarily by
inducing cancer cell apoptosis. The leading cancer
death worldwide is lung cancer; non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) is responsible for more than 80% of

INTRODUCTION
Many antitumor compounds kill sensitive cells by
inducing apoptosis. Generally, apoptosis pathways include
signaling via mitochondria (intrinsic) or the death receptors
(extrinsic) pathway. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by the
ligation of death receptors (DRs), e.g., Fas or TNF receptors.
Activated initiator caspase-8 then cleaves the downstream
effector caspases (caspase-3, -6 and -7) in a caspase cascade,
which subsequently cleave a broad spectrum of target
substrates, resulting in apoptotic cell death. The intrinsic
pathway includes alterations in mitochondrial permeability
transition as well as mitochondrial membrane potential,
which results in the discharge of apoptogenic factors, e.g.,
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c, from the
mitochondria into the cytosol [1]. In both the intrinsic and

total lung cancer cases [4, 5]. Approximately 30-40% of
patients present with locally advanced stage III disease
[6]. Many cancer patients remain refractory to therapy
even though there have been significant improvements
in chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. Thus,
it is necessary to identify new agents that can improve
the antitumor effects and minimize the side effects of
commonly prescribed chemotherapy drugs.
Nowadays, traditional Chinese herbal remedies have
been given significant scrutiny as new anticancer drugs and
novel chemotherapy adjuvants to improve the competence
of cancer chemotherapy and to relieve chemotherapy side
effects. Despite the fact that the healing mechanisms
are not yet understood, some agents have aided cancer
patients battling their disease, resulting in fewer side
effects than other treatments [7]. Chemicals taken from
herbs have potential because several natural compounds,
which include a selection of flavonoid compounds, have
been shown to exhibit antitumor functions [8, 9]. Cancer
research trends have shown that flavonoids can be used
alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents to
control the growth of many types of tumor cells [10].
Astragalin (AG; C21H20O11; shown in Figure 1A), also
known as kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucoside, is a flavonoid
isolated from the leaves of persimmon or Rosa agrestis.
It is widely found in tea and has been used to treat many
diseases as a traditional Chinese medicine for a long time.
Several groups have confirmed that AG exhibits a number
of biological properties, including anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, and anti-atopic dermatitis effects [11–14].
In addition, AG can attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced inflammatory responses by suppressing the NFкB signaling pathway [15]. However, few studies have
investigated the therapeutic potential of AG as a cancer
therapy agent. Herein, we investigated the effects of this
compound on cell viability as well as apoptosis induction
in human lung cancer cell lines. We also assessed
whether the MAPK cascade, caspase activation and NFкB pathway are involved in the underlying mechanisms.
Additionally, our data demonstrated that AG could
sensitize tumor cells to TNFα-triggered cell death via
inhibiting the activity of NF-кB. Meanwhile, the results
demonstrated that AG could, in a time-dependent manner,
alter the sensitivity of NSCLC cell line A549 to Fas/FasLinduced apoptosis.

0.74% and 41.2 ± 2.55% with AG treatment at 5 μg/mL
and 40 µg/mL, respectively. In contrast, H1299 cells were
relatively resistant to AG treatment; the rate of inhibition
was only 13.2 ± 0.64% after treatment with 20 μg/mL of
AG. However, we detected no obvious cytotoxicity in
the BEAS-2B cells. These observations suggested that
AG exhibited selective cytotoxic effects on tumor cells
without exerting cytotoxic effects on normal cells.

RESULTS

AG induces apoptosis in a caspase-dependent
manner

Effects of AG on NSCLC cell apoptosis
Next, experiments were performed to conclude
whether there was a close association between AGmediated anti-proliferative effects on cells and apoptotic
cell death. Propidium iodide (PI) staining was used
for the evaluation of apoptosis. The NSCLC cell lines
A549 and H1299 were treated with AG at the indicated
concentrations. As shown in Figure 2A, the number of
cells stained with PI increased after AG treatment dosedependently, indicating the induction of apoptosis. DAPI
staining also indicated the induction of apoptosis in A549
cells treated with AG. Apoptotic cells show a typical
morphological change termed nuclear condensation. This
change is able to be detected by DAPI staining, including
in the early stages of cell death [16]. Most A549 cells in
the untreated group showed fluorescence of a uniform
blue color, as shown in Supplementary Figure 1. The
percentage of cells that displayed condensed nuclei
(naturally apoptotic cells) was 6.2 ± 0.6 (%). However,
nuclear condensation was apparent in cells treated with
10 μg/mL AG; the ratio of cells exhibiting apoptotic
morphology was 18.5 ± 2.1 (%). The results of TUNEL
assays were consistent with the data described above
(Figure 2B). Compared with untreated cells, 20 μg/mL
AG induced apoptosis in 30.3% and 19.3% of A549 and
H1299 cells, respectively.

Effects of AG on NSCLC cell clonogenic growth
We further investigated whether treatment with AG
had an effect on NSCLC cell clonogenic growth. Colonyforming assays showed that AG suppressed the clonogenic
growth of H1299 and A549 cells dose-dependently.
Treatment with 40 μg/mL AG significantly inhibited the
clonogenic growth of H1299 and A549 cells by 72.9 %
and 81.3%, respectively (Figure 2C).

Effects of AG on NSCLC cell growth

To investigate the ways by which AG induces
apoptosis in NSCLC cells, cells were exposed to 5, 10, or
20 μg/mL AG for 24 h, and then caspase activation was
analyzed using Western blotting. Apoptosis is mediated
mainly by the caspase enzymes. Effector caspases, such
as caspase-3, -6, and -7, are eventually activated when any
stimuli triggers apoptosis. As a result of AG treatment,

Firstly, MTT assay was carried out to evaluate the
effects of AG on tumor cell proliferation. A normal cell
line and two NSCLC cell lines were treated with AG for
24 h. The growth of the NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299
was significantly inhibited dose-dependently, as shown in
Figure 1B. In A549 cells, growth was inhibited by 3.2 ±

increased cleavage of caspase-8, -9, -3, and PARP were
observed (Figure 3A). Figure 3B shows the measurements
of caspase activity, which implied that caspase-9 and
caspase-3 activities were increased 4.6- and 5.8-fold in
cells receiving treatment of 20 μg/mL AG, as compared
with the control. With the combination of caspase
inhibitors z-LEHD-FMK and z-DEVD-FMK, the AGinduced activation of caspase was abolished, and A549
cells were prevented from apoptosis. Caspase inhibitors
also increased cell viability after combined treatment

(Figure 3C). Our results suggested that activation
of caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway was a major
mechanism by which AG exerted its apoptotic effects of
NSCLC cells.
Then, the effects of AG treatment on the balance
between pro-apoptotic (for example, Bad or Bax) and antiapoptotic (for example, Bcl-xl or Bcl-2) members of the
Bcl-2 family in H1299 and A549 cells were examined. The
data indicated that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was also
activated, as demonstrated by a decrease in the expression

of Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 and an increase in the expression of
Bad and Bax (Figure 3D). Thus, the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio was
increased in both NSCLC cell lines (Figure 3E). These
data suggested that AG induced NSCLC cell apoptosis via
caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway.

Akt inhibitor increased AG-induced apoptosis in A549 and
H1299 cells (Figure 4C). Thus, inhibition of the survival
MAPK ERK in A549 and H1299 cells may also account
for the apoptotic effects of AG.

AG inhibits NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation
and IκBα degradation

Inhibitory effects of AG on PI3K/Akt and
MAPK activation

NF-κB is a cellular survival factor, which can lead to
the upregulation of several anti-apoptotic genes that block
apoptosis, including c-FLIP, Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 [18].
Inhibition of NF-κB results in decreased expression of
the NF-κB target anti-apoptotic proteins, thus promoting
apoptosis. Thereafter, we investigated whether different
concentrations of AG could affect the activity of NFκB. Low doses of AG did not alter the protein level of
NF-κB/p65 apparently. However, treatment of A549
and H1299 cells with ≥10 µg/mL AG inhibited the
nucleus translocation of NF-κB (Figure 5A), leading to
the inhibition of the transactivation of NF-κB-regulated
genes, including Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 (Supplementary Figure
2). Additionally, AG treatment resulted in increased
IκBα levels in both a time- and dose-dependent manner
(Figure 5A, 5B). AG treatment also suppressed the
phosphorylation of IκBα, as shown in Figures 5A and
5B. This suggested that it abrogated the release of IκBα
from NF-κB heterodimer and blocked the proteasomal
degradation of IκBα. IκB phosphorylation by its kinase
IκB kinase (IKK) is a crucial step in the activation of

We then assessed alterations in the survival
pathways in NSCLC cells to further investigate the
mechanisms behind AG-induced cell death. Mitogenic
and Akt survival pathways have the ability to intensify
cellular proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and potentiate
the downstream NF-κB survival pathway [17]. To assess
whether the Akt pathway was affected by AG and played
a role in AG-induced NSCLC cell death, A549 and H1299
cells were exposed to increasing dosages of AG for 24 h.
As shown in Figure 4A, AG suppressed the activation of
PI3K and Akt dose-dependently. Since c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK), ERK and p38MAPK also pay key roles in
determining cell fate, we also evaluated the effects of AG
on the activation of these protein kinases. As shown in
Figure 4B, AG decreased p38 and ERK phosphorylation
dose-dependently in both cell lines, but increased JNK
phosphorylation. Specific inhibitors were then used to
assess whether the phosphorylation of Akt or ERK plays
a critical role in AG-triggered cell death. Treating cells
with AZD6244, a MEK inhibitor, or LY294002, a PI3K/

apoptosis

NF-κB [19]. We subsequently studied whether AG
inhibited IKK activation in NSCLC cells to elucidate the
underlying mechanisms accounting for deactivation of
NF-κB after treatment with AG. As shown in Figure 5A,
AG strongly attenuated IKK-β phosphorylation in A549
and H1299 cells. We therefore speculated that AG could
inactivate NF-κB by inhibiting IKK-β phosphorylation.
The NF-κB pathway provides a pivotal link between
inflammation and cancer. Exposure to proinflammatory
stimuli in the tumor microenvironment may result in
the activation of NF-κB in cancer. LPS is a powerful
activator of NF-κB that can induce the inflammatory
response in tumor cells. Therefore, the effects of AG on
NF-κB activation induced by LPS were explored. The
results showed that, compared with the control group,
LPS (2 μg/mL) significantly reduced IκBα protein
levels and enhanced the translocation of NF-κB from
cytoplasm to nuclear in a time-dependent manner (Figure
6A). However, pre-treatment with AG (10 or 20 μg/mL)
suppressed nuclear translocation of NF-κB induced by
LPS in both a dose- and time-dependent manner in A549
cells (Figure 6B, 6C).

Although TNFα has cytotoxic effects on many
tumors, it can also induce a marked inflammatory response
via activating NF-κB. A number of tumor cells are resistant
to TNFα, which is mostly due to NF-κB activation.
To investigate whether AG treatment has an effect on
TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, an NF-κB-dependent
gene reporter assay was performed. A549 cells were
transfected with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct
transiently and then treated with TNFα. Treatment of
cells with TNFα enhanced luciferase activity; however,
AG attenuated the NF-κB activity induced by TNFα
dose-dependently (Figure 7A). Further investigations
into the molecular mechanism of action of AG showed
that it inhibited the degradation of IκBα induced by TNFα
and thereby blocked NF-κB (Figure 7B, 7C). Moreover,
A549 cells were resistant to TNFα-triggered cell death
at the concentration of 20 ng/mL. However, as shown in
Figure 7D, AG and TNFα combinative treatment induced
a synergistic increase in TNFα-triggered cell death

activity.

monotherapy induced apoptosis in 20.3% and 19.3%
of cells respectively, whereas the combination of FasL
and AG could induce apoptosis in 37.9% of cells.
Similarly, pre-treatment with AG for 12 h followed by
FasL treatment (18 h) produced 31.9% of apoptotic
cells. Nevertheless, when cells were exposed to AG for
24 h, apoptosis induced by FasL was reduced to 14.1%.
Western blotting was used to examine the expression
of Fas in A549 cells following pre-treatment with
AG. Figure 8B showed that A549 cells constitutively
expressed Fas. The basal expression of Fas was
significantly reduced after AG treatment for 24 h. These
data suggested that AG changed the susceptibility of
A549 cells to Fas/FasL-triggered apoptosis by altering
the expression of Fas.

Effects of AG on Fas/FasL-triggered apoptosis
Fas, also known as CD95, is a member of the
TNF receptor family. FasL (also known as CD95L)
is the corresponding ligand of Fas; binding of Fas by
FasL results in apoptosis of Fas-expressing cells. A549
NSCLC cells have been reported to be sensitive to Fas/
FasL-triggered apoptosis [20]. Therefore, we studied
whether the sensitivity of A549 cells to FasL-induced
apoptosis could be changed by AG pre-treatment at
various intervals. As shown in Figure 8A, FasL and AG

H&E staining indicated that tumor tissues from
mice treated with AG had more severe necrosis than
those that received the control treatment. The untreated
control tumors showed tissue necrosis interspersed with
viable cancer cells. The AG therapy, however, resulted
in large areas of continuous necrosis within the tumor
tissues (Figure 10A, 10B). The results of TUNEL assays
further suggested that treatment with AG also induced
programmed cell death in vivo (Figure 10A, 10B).

for the discovery of novel chemotherapeutic drugs [21–
23]. Flavonoids are phenolic substances with potential
antitumor function [24, 25]. One of these compounds,
AG, a glycosidic form of kaempferol isolated from Rosa
agrestis, has been described to exhibit anti-autophagy,
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, and
anti-atopic effects [11, 13, 26–28]. Cytotoxic activity
of flavonoids was reported to be related to the origin of
cancer cells [29]. AG was previously reported to exert
highly cytotoxic effects on HepG2 cells [30]. Kaempferol,
which is a phytoestrogen belonging to the flavonoids
mostly found in fruits and plants, has activity against
many types of cancer via regulating a variety of cancer cell
features, such as cell cycle [31], inflammation [32, 33],
and apoptosis [34, 35]. Kaempferol has also been found
to exhibit anti-oxidant and cellular membrane protective
effects [36]. However, the efflux of kaempferol restricts
its potential use as an anticancer agent [37, 38]. Therefore,
in the current study, we studied whether the glycoside of
kaempferol, AG, has a remarkable bio-activity in lung
cancer using a pair of NSCLC cell lines.
MTT assays revealed that AG inhibited the
proliferation of tumor cells significantly. Apoptosis is

DISCUSSION
As one of the most common causes of death
worldwide, cancer takes almost 7 million lives each year.
Despite advances in the development of new therapeutic
modalities for cancer, chemotherapy is still a fundamental
tool for cancer treatment primarily through induction of
apoptosis in tumor cells. Various treatments for cancer
are available; however, multi-drug resistance causes a
rather low success rate in current chemotherapies, which
emphasizes the importance of exploring new effective and
safe antitumor compounds or drugs. Natural compounds
isolated from medicinal plants are promising resources

signaling pathways. To investigate the anticancer
mechanism of action of AG, the activation of caspases-8,
-9, and -3, as well as NF-κB/p65 activity were measured.
The data indicated that AG induced apoptosis in tumor
cells via the activation of caspase-9/caspase-3 and the

inhibition of NF-κB/p65. The activation of caspases
subsequently led to the cleavage of PARP, nuclear
condensation, and finally, the induction of apoptotic
cell death. The Bcl-2 family proteins play anti-apoptotic
(Bcl-xl, Bcl-2) or pro-apoptotic (Bid, Bak, Bax) roles
in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by regulation

on the mitochondrial membrane permeability. It is
well-known that upregulation of Bax:Bcl-2 ratio will
lead to the discharge of some pro-apoptotic proteins
from the mitochondria [39]. Conversely, the elevated
expression of some anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bclxl and Bcl-2, prevents apoptosis of cancer cells [40]. In
this study, AG treatment upregulated Bax and Bad with
concomitant downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl; this
caused upregulation of the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and triggered
the activation of mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade
to induce apoptotic cell death in A549 and H1299 cells. In
support of the pro-apoptotic effects of AG, Burmistrova
et al. [41] have reported that, in human leukemia cells,
AG heptaacetate induced cell death including apparent
caspases activation and a marked upregulation of the
Bax:Bcl-2 ratio.
The MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)
family consists of a series of serine/threonine kinases
playing critical roles in control of growth and
differentiation, as well as in apoptotic signaling, which
include members such as ERK 1/2, p38, and JNK. The
exact signaling pathways among three types of MAPKs
are still unclear; however, ERK 1/2 is thought to play an

important role in survival [42], whereas in a number of
cell types, JNK has been reported to be associated with
proapoptotic actions [42]. MAPK signaling cascades
have also been demonstrated to be involved in NF-κB
activation [43]. In our study, AG treatment resulted in
JNK activation; however, it inhibited PI3K/Akt activation,
as well as p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Therefore,
combinative treatment with AG and Akt and/or MEK1/2
inhibitors might be a potential therapeutic strategy in
clinical therapy. As expected, our data indicated that
NSCLC cell apoptosis was enhanced when the PI3K/Akt
or ERK1/2 pathway was blocked. This suggests that AG
plays a central apoptotic role in tumor cells, probably by
inhibiting MAPK signaling pathways. Previous studies
demonstrated that AG heptaacetate activated ERK1/2 and
p38 in human leukemia cells [41]. In our research, we
found that AG decreased ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation
in NSCLC cells. This might be explained by the fact that
the current study and the report by Burmistrova et al. [41]
used different cell types, and that the compounds used
differed slightly.
A main cause of cancer is inflammation. The
activation of NF-κB, which is a principle indication of

Figure 11: A proposed signaling pathway by which AG induces cell death in NSCLC cells. AG treatment inhibits Akt
phosphorylation via the PI3K; this inhibits IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, suppresses the translocation of p65, and, in turn,
decreases the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression, leading to apoptosis of NSCLC cells. AG treatment also inhibits LPS- or TNFα-induced NFκB activation, sensitizing NSCLC cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis. In addition, AG treatment activates JNK, but inhibits ERK signaling,
which finally leads to decreased cell survival.

inflammatory response and is often observed in malignant
tumors including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer [44, 45],
could be a missing link between inflammation and cancer
[46]. In most resting cells, NF-κB exists in the cytosol
as an inactive form associated with an inhibitory protein
termed IκB. Once cells are exposed to inflammatory
stimuli, e.g., LPS and TNFα, IκB is phosphorylated by
the upstream kinase IKK and subsequently degraded,
leading to the release and nuclear translocation of NFκB [47]. The activated NF-κB heterodimers then binds
to consensus sequences activating expression of target
genes [48]. LPS, a component of the Gram-negative
bacterial cell wall, can induce strong proinflammatory
response in cells and animals [49]. The binding of LPS
to its receptor TLR4 results in the activation of IKK, the
subsequent degradation of IκBα and NF-κB activation.
The data presented herein indicated that NF-κB was
activated in A549 cells treated by LPS. Moreover, AG
inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-κB by inhibiting
IκBα degradation dose-dependently. These results strongly
imply that AG exhibits potent anti-inflammatory function
and that it might represent a novel strategy for cancer
therapy.
Resistance to apoptosis rescues tumor cells from
death and is critical for cancer cell survival. Thereafter,
targeting the apoptotic pathway is a main strategy for
antitumor therapy. The death receptors pathway can be
induced by ligation of a subset of plasma membrane tumor
necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members, such as
the receptors for FasL and TNFα [50]. Strategies that target
the death receptors signaling have been proposed and
investigated for the therapy of many cancers [51]. TNFα
has previously been utilized in antitumor therapies because
of its cytotoxic effects on tumor cells [52]. However, the
clinical advantages of TNFα are limited because it induces
a profound inflammatory response by activating NF-κB
[53]. Previous studies have demonstrated that, in NSCLC
cell lines including A549 cells, NF-κB was activated by
TNFα, which promoted cell survival, angiogenesis, and
invasion [54–56]. NF-κB activity largely controls the
decision between life and death with TNFα treatment.
Therefore, suppressing TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling
can potentiate TNFα-induced apoptosis [44]. Our study
demonstrated that AG attenuated NF-κB activity and
induced a synergistic increase in apoptosis in A549
cells treated with TNFα. In accord with past reports, the
inhibition of NF-κB activation led to increased TNFαinduced apoptosis [57]. Moreover, AG reduced TNFαstimulated IκBα degradation, which suppressed the
nuclear translocation of NF-κB. These data suggest that
AG can sensitize TNFα-induced apoptosis and reduce the
pro-inflammatory side effects by suppressing the NF-κB
activity. Therefore, AG may be used as a TNFα adjuvant
for cancer therapy.
FasL is a transmembrane protein that belongs to
the TNF family. The FasL-Fas association plays a critical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

role in the regulation of various biological responses
[58]. Interestingly, the current study indicated that A549
cells exhibited opposing responses to FasL-triggered
apoptosis following AG treatments at various intervals. As
compared with cells receiving FasL or AG monotherapy,
cell apoptosis increased about two-fold after combinative
treatment with AG and FasL, or pre-treatment with AG
for 12 h. Nevertheless, FasL-induced apoptosis in A549
cells decreased markedly after pre-treatment with AG for
24 h. Consistent with this, the reduction in FasL-triggered
apoptosis was concomitant with the decrease of Fas
expression in A549 cells following AG pre-treatment for
24 h. Together, these results presented here suggest that
AG could alter the sensitivity of A549 cells to Fas/FasLinduced apoptosis time-dependently.
Similar results were observed in vivo. Using a tumor
xenograft model, we found that AG-triggered cancer
cell apoptosis also occurred in vivo, and that 50 mg/kg
AG efficiently inhibited tumor growth. According to the
H&E and TUNEL staining results, the most effective
suppression of tumor growth was attributable to apoptosis
induced by 50 mg/kg AG. The novel antitumor effect of
AG in NSCLC cells via the inhibition of MAPKs and NFκB activity suggest that AG could be used as a promising
drug for cancer therapy.
In conclusion, our study showed, for the first time,
the apoptotic effect of AG against NSCLC cells. Four
novel findings may account for this role of AG treatment:
(1) activation of caspases; (2) alteration of the Bax:Bcl-2
ratio; (3) reduction of LPS- or TNFα-induced nuclear
translocation of NF-кB; and (4) inhibition of MAPKs and
PI3K/Akt pathway (Figure 11). AG treatment to control
the growth of cancer cells might be a potential therapeutic
strategy. It may circumvent adverse side effects and drug
resistance that frequently occurred in current cancer
therapy. In the coming years, the promising anticancer
mechanism of AG should be further studied to establish
a powerful therapeutic strategy for successful therapy of
human cancer. However, further in vivo pharmacological
and clinical investigations are required.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells, cell culture, and reagents
NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299, and human
bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B cells) were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Philadelphia, PA, USA). NSCLC cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). BEAS-2B cells were
cultured following standard guidelines. Thawed cells
initially grew in a pre-coated flask containing fibronectin
(0.01 g/mL), bovine collagen type I (0.03 mg/mL), and
26954

Oncotarget

bovine serum albumin (0.01 mg/mL). Following overnight
growth in this pre-coated flask, BEAS-2B cells were subcultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 U/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
All cells were cultured in a humidified CO2 incubator at
37 °C. MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (Calbiochem, Merck
Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany), PI3K/Akt inhibitor
LY294002 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and freshly prepared each
time before use. AG (purity > 95 %) was purchased from
the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (Beijing,
China), and was dissolved in DMSO for live culture with
cells; a final culture concentration of DMSO was ≤ 0.5%.
LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) was purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). PI was purchased
from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA).

was discarded and each dish was washed twice with PBS
carefully. The cells were fixed with methanol for 15 min
and stained with a 1:10 dilution of Giemsa regent (Merck,
Germany) for 10 min. Any grouping of cells containing 30
or more cells was counted as a colony using an inverted
microscope (Zeiss, 40-fold magnification). Colony numbers
were determined from triplicate plates. Colony growth was
related to the control value without any treatment.

Caspase activity assay
Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities were measured
using colorimetric activity assay kits (Chemicon
International, CA, USA). The assay is based on the
cleavage of the chromogenic substrates, DEVDpNA and LEHD-pNA, by caspase-3 and caspase-9,
respectively. Cells were lysed in chilled lysis buffer
on ice for 10 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000
× g. Caspase substrate solution containing the specific
peptide substrate was then added to the supernatant and
incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before measurement by ELISA
reader at 405 nm

Flow cytometry
Cells were treated 0-20 μg/mL AG in the absence or
presence of either TNFα (20 ng/mL), or AZD6244 (2 μM),
or LY294002 (5 μM). 18 h after treatment, the ratio of cell
apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry analysis as
previously described [59].

Western blot analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared in 1 mM TrisHCl (pH 6.8) lysis buffer containing 10% SDS, 1%
glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 mM NaF and
protease inhibitor cocktail. Supernatants were collected
and protein concentration was determined by the BioRad protein assay method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). In
addition, nuclear extracts were prepared as described
by Schreiber et al [60]. Western blotting used standard
protocols. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were
blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20, and incubated with primary antibodies:
p-JNK, JNK, Akt, p-Akt (Ser 473), PI3K, p-PI3K, Fas,
cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), NFκB p65 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), p-IKK-β, IкBα,
p-IкBα (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), GAPDH, Lamin B,
ERK, p-ERK, p-p38, p38, IKK-β, poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), Bad, Bax, Bcl-xl, Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies
were coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and were goat
anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse. Bound antibodies were
then visualized with ECL plus Western blotting detection
reagents (GE Healthcare). Signal intensity was quantified
by densitometry using the software Image J (NIH,
Bethesda, MD). All experiments were done in triplicate
and performed at least three times independently.

Cell proliferation assay
The effects of AG on cell proliferation were
assessed by the MTT assay. Cells in the exponential
growth phase were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density
of 5000 cells per well. After 24 h, 0-40 μg/mL AG was
added to the medium. The cells were incubated at 37
°C for 24 h, then the cell viability was determined by
the colorimetric MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay at wave length
570 nm by TECAN Safire Fluorescence Absorbance
and Luminescence Reader (Vienna, VA, USA). The cell
viability was calculated according to the formula: Cell
viability (%) = average A570 nm of treated group/average
A570 nm of control group × 100%. Each experiment was
performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three
times.

Colony-forming assay
Colony-forming assay was performed as previously
described [59]. Briefly, about 300 cells in log phase were
plated into 60 mm tissue culture Petri-dish (Greiner) in
triplicate with 3 mL of culture medium and grown at 37
°C with 5% CO2. After 48 h culture for cell adherence
to the plate, rinsed with fresh medium, AG was added at
different concentrations (0, 20, 40 μg/mL). 48 h later, the
cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated
in drug-free medium. The medium was changed every 5
days. After culturing for additional 10-14 days, the medium

DAPI staining
DAPI staining was applied for morphological
assessment of nuclei. Treated A549 cells in 6-well plate
26955

were rinsed twice with cold PBS and stained with DAPI
solution (1 μg/mL) for 10 min at 37 °C in dark room.
Stained cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Finally, an
inverted fluorescence microscopy (CKX41, OLYMPUS,
Japan) was used to photograph the cells in the plate. At
least 200 cells were counted and classified according to
the condensed nuclei.

Antitumor activity of treatments was evaluated by tumor
growth inhibition. The formula, tumor volume = length ×
width2 × 0.52, was used to mimic the tumor volume. At
the end of study, the tumors were collected and weighed.

H&E and TUNEL assays
In a parallel animal assay (totally three groups, and
three mice per group), the tumor establishment and drug
treatment are the same as described above. On the 21th
day, mice were euthanized. Tumors were collected, fixed
with 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin. Tissue
sections (5 μm in thickness) were prepared according to
standard protocols for hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) staining.
Apoptotic cells in tumor sections (two sections per
mouse, three mice in total) were visualized by the TUNEL
technique according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(Merck).

TUNEL assays
Exponentially growing cells were treated with 0-20
μg/mL AG for 24 h. The TdT-mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed as previously
described [59].

Transient transfection and luciferase activity
assay
For transient transfections, A549 cells were seeded at
2 × 106 in a 6-well plate one day before transient transfection.
The expression vector containing NF-кB luciferase reporter
construct (pNF-κB-LUC, plasmid containing NF-кB binding
site) were transfected with serum- and antibiotics-free RPMI
1640 medium containing 8 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After 5 h of incubation,
medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 medium containing
10 % FBS and antibiotics. Cells were allowed to recover at
37 °C for 20 h and subsequently were stimulated as indicated.
For luciferase activity assay, cell lysates were prepared and
measured for luciferase activity using Luciferase Assay
System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS
software (version 11.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data were
expressed as the mean ± standard deviations (SD). For
paired data, statistical analyses were performed using
two-tailed Student’s t-tests. For multiple comparisons,
statistical analyses were performed using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey post-test.
For all analyses, P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

day. All tumor-bearing mice were divided randomly into
three groups, and treatment was initiated on the 7th day
when the volume of tumor reached a size of approximately
50 mm3. The mice were treated with AG (20 or 50 mg/kg,
administered by gavage) every two days for a total of
three weeks. Control mice received treatment of PBS.
