Abstract
Double-hit B-cell lymphoma is a common designation for a group of tumors
characterized by concurrent translocations of MYC and BCL2, BCL6, or other genes.
The prognosis of concurrent MYC and BCL6 translocations is not well known. In
this study, we assessed rearrangements and expression of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6
in 898 patients with de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with standard
chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus
rituximab). Neither BCL6 translocation alone (more frequent in activated B-cell like

diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) nor in combination with MYC translocation (observed in
2.0% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) predicted poorer survival in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma patients. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with MYC/BCL6 co-expression
did have significantly poorer survival, however, MYC/BCL6 co-expression had no effect on
prognosis in the absence of MYC/BCL2 co-expression, and had no additive impact in MYC+/
BCL2+ cases. The isolated MYC+/BCL6+/BCL2− subset, more frequent in germinal center
B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, had significantly better survival compared with
the isolated MYC+/BCL2+/BCL6− subset (more frequent in activated B-cell like diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma). In summary, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with either MYC/
BCL6 rearrangements or MYC/BCL6 co-expression did not always have poorer prognosis;
MYC expression levels should be evaluated simultaneously; and double-hit B-cell lymphoma
needs to be refined based on the specific genetic abnormalities present in these tumors.

INTRODUCTION

has been developed in recent years referring to DLBCL
with coexpression of MYC and BCL2 detected by
immunohistochemistry (IHC), regardless of activation
mechanisms. MYC/BCL2 DPL is more common
than MYC/BCL2 DHL and accounts for 18-44% of
DLBCL cases and might result from gene amplification,
transcriptional dysregulation or both [11, 22-26]. A
series of studies have shown that patients with MYC/
BCL2 DPL have a significantly poorer outcome than
patients who express only one or neither protein, with a
5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 25% following
R-CHOP treatment [11, 22]. Interestingly, unlike MYC/
BCL2 DHL which is mainly observed in the GCB subtype,
MYC/BCL2 DPL is more common in the activated-B celllike (ABC) subtype and may largely contribute to inferior
survival via NF-κB pathway activation [23].
According to the concept of DHL used currently,
another type of DHL is MYC/BCL6 DHL with concurrent
MYC and BCL6 rearrangements [1, 2]. However, there
are far less data available for MYC/BCL6 DHL, in part
because of its rarity. BCL6 is a transcriptional suppressor
required for germinal center formation with numerous
transcriptional targets, including the cell cycle regulator
CCND2 and MYC, which explains downregulation
of MYC in normal germinal center B-cells [27-29].
Studies by others have suggested that BCL6 expression
is associated with better survival of DLBCL patients
[24, 30]. The frequency and the prognostic impact of
concurrent MYC/BCL6 rearrangements and MYC/BCL6
protein coexpression in DLBCL remain unclear.
In this study, we assessed the frequency,
clinicopathologic features, and the prognostic impact of
concurrent MYC/BCL6 rearrangements or MYC/BCL6
coexpression in a large cohort of de novo DLBCL patients
treated with R-CHOP, in comparison to MYC/BCL2
rearrangements and MYC/BCL2 coexpression. The study
evaluated the role of each genetic translocation separately
and in combinations, providing reliable conclusion and
practical recommendations for diagnostic workup and
prognostic prediction.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the
most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and
has heterogeneous biologic features. Chromosomal
rearrangements, the biologic and diagnostic hallmarks
of some other types of B-cell lymphoma, also occur in
DLBCL. The most common chromosomal rearrangements
in DLBCL are those involving chromosomal gene loci
8q24/MYC, 18q21/BCL2, and 3q27/BCL6 [1, 2]. MYC
rearrangement, a disease-initiating event in Burkitt
lymphoma (BL), can be observed in approximately 10%
of de novo DLBCL and correlates with a poorer outcome
[3-7]. However, MYC rearrangement alone may not
explain the poor prognosis of patients with DLBCL that
carry MYC rearrangement plus another chromosomal
rearrangement. The designation double-hit lymphoma
(DHL) has been used for a B-cell lymphoma carrying
a MYC/8q24 rearrangement in combination with a
rearrangement involving either BCL2, BCL6, or rarely
other known oncogenes [2, 8, 9].
By far, the most common and well-studied type
of DHL is characterized by concurrent MYC and BCL2
rearrangements (MYC/BCL2 DHL), occurring in about 5%
of all cases of DLBCL [10, 11]. As key regulators of cell
proliferation and apoptosis, respectively, MYC and BCL2
may act synergistically to drive the pathogenesis of MYC/
BCL2 DHL [12]. Clinically, patients with MYC/BCL2
DHL often exhibit adverse prognostic factors, such as
high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, advanced
stage of disease, extranodal involvement, and a high
proliferation index with a median value of 90%. There
is a general consensus that MYC/BCL2 DHL represents
a treatment-refractory subgroup with a median survival
of approximately 8 months [13-20]. Despite the dismal
outcome of patients with MYC/BCL2 DHL, almost all of
these tumors arise within the germinal center B cell-like
(GCB) subtype, a generally favorable prognostic subtype,
illustrating a discordance between clinical behavior and
cell of origin (COO) subtypes [1, 15, 17, 21].
As an extension of the concept of MYC/BCL2
DHL, the concept of “double protein lymphoma (DPL)”

observed in two COO subtypes (9 GCB, 5 ABC) without
significantly difference in frequency (P = 0.37).
Using immunohistochemistry 249 (30.2%), 439
(51.7%), and 555 (62.6%) patients had high levels of
MYC (≥70%), BCL2 (≥70%), and BCL6 ( > 50%)
expression, respectively. MYC expression was similarly
distributed between GCB and ABC subtypes (P = 0.17)
whereas BCL2 and BCL6 expression were significantly
more common in the ABC and GCB subtypes, respectively
(both P < 0.0001), in contrast to the association of
their gene translocations with GCB and ABC subtype
respectively. MYC+/BCL2+, MYC+/BCL6+, and BCL2+/
BCL6+ coexpression were observed in 146 (17.6%), 178
(21.7%), and 282 (33.4%) cases, respectively. Unlike the
predominance of MYC+BCL2+ coexpression in the ABC
subtype (P = 0.0079), both MYC+/BCL6+ and BCL2+/
BCL6+ coexpression were equally distributed between the
two COO subtypes (P = 0.35 and P = 0.47, respectively).
All MYC protein positive patients were further stratified
into three subgroups: MYC+/BCL2+/BCL6- (MYC+/BCL2+
coexpression, BCL6-), MYC+/BCL6+/BCL2- (MYC+/
BCL6+ coexpression, BCL2-) and MYC+/BCL2+/BCL6+
coexpression. The MYC+BCL2+BCL6- subgroup was
predominantly of ABC subtype (P = 0.0019), whereas
the MYC+BCL6+BCL2- subgroup was more commonly of

Overall frequency and distribution
The median age of the study population was 64
years (range, 16-95). The median follow-up time was 58.9
months (range, 1-187 months). Among the 898 cases,
469 (52%) were GCB and 429 (48%) were determined
to be GCB and ABC subtype, respectively. The complete
response rate to R-CHOP therapy was 75%. As shown in
Table 1, rearrangements of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 were
detected in 71 (11.8%) of 600, 94 (13.6%) of 690, and
145 (23.1%) of 628 cases, respectively. MYC and BCL2
rearrangements were detected predominantly in GCB
subtype (P = 0.0005 and P < 0.0001, respectively) whereas
BCL6 rearrangement was more frequently observed
in the ABC subtype (P = 0.0002). MYC/BCL2, MYC/
BCL6, and BCL2/BCL6 concurrent rearrangements were
identified in 20 (2.8%), 14 (2%), and 21 (2.9%) patients,
respectively. Both MYC/BCL2 and BCL2/BCL6 concurrent
rearrangements were observed mostly in the GCB subtype
(MYC+/BCL2+: P < 0.0001; BCL2+/BCL6+: P = 0.0045)
whereas MYC/BCL6 concurrent rearrangements were

67 (P = 0.0002), and the lymphoma was more often of
ABC subtype (P = 0.0079). Patients with MYC+/BCL6+
coexpression were associated with advanced disease stage
(P = 0.015), extranodal sites (P = 0.011), low complete
response rate (P = 0.0023) and high Ki-67 index (P =
0.0017). When MYC+/BCL2+/BCL6- and MYC+/BCL6+/
BCL2- subgroups were isolated from the MYC+/BCL2+
and MYC+/BCL6+ patients respectively, MYC+/BCL2+/
BCL6- tumors were more often of ABC subtype, whereas
MYC+/BCL6+/BCL2- tumors were more commonly of
GCB subtype (P = 0.0003) (Table 2).

Clinicopathologic features of DLBCL with
concurrent rearrangement and coexpression
The clinicopathologic features of patients in
the study cohort with or without concurrent gene
rearrangements and protein coexpression are listed in
Table 2. DLBCL patients with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements
more frequently had large tumors (P = 0.02) and a lower
complete response rate (P = 0.0033), and commonly
the tumors were of GCB subtype (P < 0.0001). No
clinicopathologic features were significantly different
between DLBCL patients with concurrent MYC/BCL6
rearrangements versus patients without MYC/BCL6
concurrent rearrangement, although larger tumor size was
of borderline significance (P = 0.058).
Patients with MYC+/BCL2+ coexpression were
more often of older age (P = 0.0016) and more often
had advanced disease stage (P < 0.0001), extranodal
involvement (P = 0.0026), large tumor size (P = 0.03),
International Prognostic Index score > 2 (P < 0.0001),
low complete response rate (P = 0.0071), and high Ki-

Prognostic impact of concurrent rearrangements
of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 in DLBCL
We first assessed the prognostic impact of
rearrangements of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 in DLBCL
(Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). Both MYC and
BCL2 rearrangements correlated to a poorer survival in
the whole cohort (P = 0.003 for MYC, Figure 1A; P =
0.046 for BCL2, Figure 1B) and in the GCB subtype (P <
0.0001 for MYC, Figure 1D; P < 0.0009 for BCL2, Figure
1E) but not in the ABC subtype (Figure 1G-1H). BCL6

BCL2 translocations had a worse survival than patients
with MYC rearrangement alone (overall survival [OS]: P
= 0.025; PFS: P = 0.012, Figure 2A-2B). However, no
difference was observed in OS and PFS between DLBCL
patients with MYC/BCL6 rearrangement versus DLBCL
patients with only MYC rearrangement (Figure 2C-2D).

translocation, by contrast, did not correlate with poorer
survival for either the whole cohort (P = 0.33, Figure1C)
or in the GCB (P = 0.87, Figure 1F) and ABC (P = 0.32,
Figure 1I) subtypes.

There was also no difference in OS and PFS between
patients with DLBCL with BCL2/BCL6 rearrangement
versus DLBCL with only BCL2 rearrangement (Figure
2E-2F). Notably the survival of patients with MYC/BCL6
rearrangement appeared to be affected by MYC expression
levels (Figure 2G-2H).
The prognostic differences between patients with
concurrent rearrangements of MYC/BCL2, MYC/BCL6,
BCL2/BCL6 versus the remaining DLBCL patients
are shown in Figure 3. Only concurrent MYC/BCL2
rearrangements correlated with significantly poorer
survival (Figure 3A-3B). Additional BCL6 translocation
(triple-hit, n = 5, 26% of 19 MYC+/BCL2+ cases with
BCL6 translocation status available) had no synergistic
effect with concurrent MYC/BCL2 rearrangements and, on
the contrary, attenuated the adverse impact of concurrent
MYC/BCL2 rearrangements (Figure 3G-3H).

did not correlate with poorer patient survival, either in
the whole group or in COO subtypes (Figure 4C, 4F, and
4I). In contrast, MYC+ or BCL2+ expression in DLBCL
correlated with significantly poorer survival for the overall
patient cohort (P < 0.0001, Figure 4A-4B) and for patients
with GCB (MYC+: P < 0.0001, Figure 4D; BCL2+: P =
0.004, Figure 4E) and ABC subtypes of DLBCL (MYC+:
P = 0.032, Figure 4G; BCL2+: P < 0.0001, Figure 4H).
Our results further showed that MYC+/BCL2+
(P < 0.0001, Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S3A),
MYC+/BCL6+ (OS: P = 0.0001, Figure 5C; PFS: P
= 0.0002, Supplementary Figure S3C), and BCL2+/
BCL6+ (OS: P = 0.014, Figure 5E; PFS: P = 0.033,
Supplementary Figure S3E) coexpression correlated with
significantly poorer survival in the overall cohort. The
inferior survival of patients MYC+/BCL2+ and MYC+/
BCL6+ DLBCL compared with all other DLBCL patients
was significant for both the GCB and ABC subtypes,
whereas BCL2+/BCL6+ only correlated with poorer OS
for patients with ABC-DLBCL (Supplementary Figure
S4). MYC expression showed dependence and synergy
only with BCL2 expression (Figure 5B, Supplementary
Figure S3B); BCL6 expression had no additive adverse
impact in patients with MYC+, BCL2+ or MYC+/BCL2+

adhesion, extracellular matrix, and migration (MYO3B,
SLAMF7, SILEC10/12, TPM4, and SRGN).
Comparison of the GEP of MYC+ BCL6+ versus
+
MYC BCL2+ DLBCL did not show significant DEGs.
We further compared the GEP of isolated MYC+BCL2BCL6+ DLBCL versus isolated MYC+BCL2+BCL6DLBCL, which resulted in 36 DEGs at the false
discovery rate threshold of 0.05 (Table 3B, Figure 6B).
Upregulated genes in MYC+BCL2-BCL6+ compared
with MYC+BCL2+BCL6- included BCL6, a proliferation
signature (MYBL1, NEK6, BRWD1 [bromodomain and
WD repeat domain containing 1], SFRS15, HMGN1,
and TMPO), MSH6 involved in DNA repair, DNAJC10
which promotes apoptotic in response to endoplasmic
reticulum stress, various signaling genes including
PIK3CG (PI3K catalytic subunit gamma), STAP1 (B-cell
receptor signaling) SORL1, RFTN1, GNA13, SWAP70,
and ANKRD13A, and genes involved in actin cytoskeleton
regulation and migration (MARCKSL1, VNN2, OSBPL3,
ACTR2 and etc.). Comparably, upregulated genes in
MYC+BCL2+BCL6- included signatures of apoptosis
(antiapoptotic BCL2, and paradoxically proapoptotic,
CASP10), glutamine metabolism (ALDH4A1) , indicating
that abnormal dysregulation of apoptotic and proliferation
pathways are critical in patients with MYC+BCL6+BCL2−.
In contrast, such signaling and molecular defects were
not seen in patients with MYC+BCL6−BCL2+. The
observations provide molecular basis for the difference
of outcome and survival between these two groups of
DLBCL patients.

S3F-S3G). Patients with MYC+/BCL2+ DLBCL but not
MYC+/BCL6+ DLBCL had poorer survival (Figure 5G,
Supplementary Figure S3G). The poor prognosis of
patients with MYC+/BCL6+ DLBCL was attributable to
the poorer survival of MYC+/BCL2+ DLBCL patients.
We further evaluated the survival of patients with
isolated MYC+/BCL2+/BCL6- (i.e., BCL6- DPL) versus
isolated MYC+/BCL6+/BCL2- (i.e., BCL2- DPL) DLBCL.
Patients with isolated MYC+/BCL6+ DLBCL had favorable
survival compared with isolated MYC+/BCL2+ DLBCL
patients (OS: P = 0.004, Figure 5H; PFS: P < 0.0001,

Gene expression signatures of concurrent MYC,
BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements and isolated
MYC+BCL2+ and MYC+BCL6+ coexpression
To better understand the molecular mechanisms of
the effects on prognosis, we compared the GEP of patients
with concurrent MYC/BCL2 or MYC/BCL6 rearrangements
with the remaining patients. Only MYC/BCL2 rearranged
DLBCL showed a distinctive GEP signature, whereas
concurrent MYC/BCL6 rearranged DLBCL did not
show DEGs compared with MYC rearranged DLBCL or
the remaining DLBCL patients. The GEP signature of
concurrent MYC/BCL2 rearranged DLBCL included 24
upregulated genes and 14 downregulated genes at the
false discovery rate threshold of 0.01 (Table. 3A, Figure
5A). These genes were involved in signaling (upregulation
of BMP3, SWAP70, and CELSR1, and downregulation of
PLA2G7 and DOCK10), cell proliferation (upregulated
STRBP and MUC4), metabolism (eight upregulated
genes), apoptosis (TMEM49, CFLAR, CARD16 and

Discussion

know about double-hit B-cell lymphoma is derived from
studies of the most common form, MYC/BCL2 DHL. In
contrast, very little has been published on DLBCL patients
with concurrent MYC/BCL6 rearrangements. The findings
in this study for a group of DLBCL patients treated with
R-CHOP suggest that patients with concurrent MYC/BCL6
rearrangements do not have a poorer prognosis and that
grouping these tumors with other forms of DHL could lead
to inappropriate therapy.

In the literature B-cell lymphomas with concurrent
MYC/BCL2 or MYC/BCL6 rearrangements are grouped
together as double-hit B-cell lymphomas [1, 2]. Patients
with MYC/BCL2 DHL have responded poorly to all
traditional chemotherapy regimens and have extremely
poor outcomes [1, 10, 11]. However, most of what we

In this large cohort of 898 cases of de novo DLBCL,
rearrangements of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 were found in
11.8%, 13.6% and 23.1% of cases, respectively. BCL6
rearrangements were more frequently observed in the
ABC subtype whereas MYC and BCL2 rearrangements
were more frequently observed in the GCB subtype.
Concurrent MYC/BCL6 and MYC/BCL2 rearrangements
were observed in 2.0% and 2.8% of DLBCL cases,
respectively. MYC/BCL2/BCL6 triple-hit was observed
in 38% of MYC/BCL6 and 26% of MYC/BCL2 doublehit cases. The frequencies of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6
rearrangement and concurrent MYC/BCL2 rearrangements
are similar to those reported in DLBCL in earlier studies
[10, 11, 31-34].
In this study, DLBCL patients with concurrent MYC/
BCL6 rearrangements did not have a poorer prognosis.
The notion that concurrent MYC/BCL6 rearrangements
in DLBCL is not an indication of aggressive lymphoma
was further substantiated by the lack of a distinctive GEP
signature for MYC/BCL6 rearranged DLBCL although
BCL6 was overexpressed in almost all MYC/BCL6
rearranged patients except one case with an IHC of 30%.
These phenomena might be explained by a previous
finding that up to 43% of BCL6 translocations involved
non-IG loci showing complex gene expression patterns
[35], limited case numbers, and 36% of MYC/BCL6 cases
showing low MYC expression levels (Figure 2G-2H).
In contrast, MYC/BCL2 rearranged DLBCL correlated

with significantly poorer survival, and was associated
with a distinctive GEP signature suggesting increased
proliferation, growth and metabolism and decreased
apoptosis pathway (our results showed downregulation of
both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes).
In the MD Anderson Cancer Center experience
with 52 DHL patients tested for BCL6, 24 patients with
BCL6 gene abnormality (translocation or amplification,
n = 15 and n = 9 respectively. Among them, 14 patients
had MYC/BCL2/BCL6 triple-hit) showed slightly better
survival than other patients with DHL (hazard ratio: 0.59,
95% confidence interval: 0.21-1.69, P = 0.33) [36]. Ueda
et al. presented a case report consistent with our results,
in which a person having DLBCL with concurrent MYC,
BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements achieved complete
remission after chemoradiotherapy for two years [37].
A recent study reported the largest DHL series including
41 cases with BCL6 rearrangement, in which patients’
OS was not significantly affected by whether the DHL
was MYC/BCL2 or MYC/BCL6 (P = 0.537). However,
25 (58.5%) of the 41 MYC/BCL6 patients also had BCL2
rearrangement (triple-hit) [38]. In contrast, in another
study, MYC/BCL6 (n = 13) showed significantly worse
survival than MYC/BCL2 DHL (n = 20) after exclusion
of triple-hit lymphoma [39]. These MYC/BCL6 DHL
showed a trend toward higher MYC mRNA expression and
a distinct gene expression profile compared to MYC/BCL2
DHL. In a smaller study reported by Pillai et al. B-cell

lymphoma with concurrent MYC/BCL6 rearrangements
was associated with aggressive clinical course and poor
survival [40]. A possible explanation for the discrepancy
is patient selection. In the study by Pillai et al, patients
with BL, BL-like lymphoma, and primary effusion
lymphoma were also included. Moreover, the median age
of their patients was 83 years and only one of six patients
with adequate information received chemotherapy in

combination with rituximab [40]. In this study, all patients
met morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria for
DLBCL with a median patient age of 64 years, which
is comparable to that of patients with DLBCL without
concurrent MYC/BCL6 rearrangements, and all patients
were treated with standard R-CHOP therapy.
Recently, the concept of MYC/BCL2 rearranged
DHL has been extended to MYC and BCL2 protein

Figure 5: A., C., E. Patients with DLBCL and MYC/BCL2, BCL6/MYC or BCL2/BCL6 co-expression had significantly poorer overall

survival in the DBLCL cohort. B. BCL2 overexpression had a synergetic effect with MYC overexpression and the adverse prognostic impact
of MYC depended on BCL2 overexpression. D. BCL6 expression had no synergetic effect with MYC expression. F. BCL6 expression
appeared to attenuate the adverse prognostic impact of BCL2 overexpression. G. The poorer overall survival of MYC+BCL6+ patients was
due to the poor survival of MYC+BCL2+ patients. H. Isolated MYC+BCL6+ versus MYC+BCL2+ double-positive DLBCL had significantly
better patient survival.

coexpression [11, 22, 23]. These studies showed that
patients with DLBCL with MYC/BCL2 double-positive
(by immunohistochemistry) also have a dismal prognosis,
regardless of the status of MYC or BCL2 rearrangement

[11, 22, 23]. In this study, DLBCL patients with MYC/
BCL6 coexpression showed a significantly poorer survival
than DLBCL patients without MYC/BCL6 coexpression.
However, this prognostic effect was significant only in

doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP)
therapy was collected as part of The International DLBCL
Rituximab-CHOP Consortium Program Study [33,46]. All
patients were diagnosed according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) classification system and received
treatment between 1998 and 2010. Cases were excluded
if patients had a history of low-grade B-cell lymphoma;
human immunodeficiency virus infection; or primary
mediastinal, cutaneous B cell lymphoma, or central
nervous system DLBCL. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of each participating center,
and the comprehensive collaborative study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

the presence of DLBCL with MYC/BCL2 coexpression.
The isolated MYC+BCL2-BCL6+ (from all MYC+BCL6+)
subgroup had significantly better patient survival
compared with the MYC+BCL2+BCL6- (from all
MYC+BCL2+) subgroup. Previous studies also suggested
that BCL6 expression is associated with favorable survival
in patients with DLBCL [24, 30, 41, 42].
There is a biologic basis that may explain the lack of
significantly adverse prognostic impact of recurrent MYC/
BCL6 rearrangements and MYC/BCL6 coexpression.
BCL6 represses CCND2 and MYC [27-29, 43]; we have
recently shown that MYC expression levels significantly
impact the prognosis of MYC rearranged DLBCL [44],
and our multivariate analysis suggested BCL6 expression
correlated with favorable survival (P = 0.048 for OS
and P = 0.016 for PFS, Table 1), therefore the adverse
prognostic impact of MYC might have been diminished
by high BCL6 expression in these cases. In addition to the
potential role of BCL6, the GEP signature of MYC+BCL2BCL6+ DLBCL suggested DNA repair and proapoptosis,
in contrast with the upregulation of antiapoptotic BCL2
in MYC+BCL2+BCL6- DLBCL. Interestingly, MYBL1
and LIMD1 were also significantly upregulated in
our MYC+BCL2-BCL6+ (associated with GCB) and
MYC+BCL2+BCL6- (associated with ABC) DLBCL
subgroup respectively, which is in consistent with the
correlations between a novel two-gene expression index,
“LIMD1-MYBL1 Index”, and GCB/ABC subtypes and
clinical outcome [45, 46].
In summary, DLBCL patients with concurrent MYC/
BCL6 rearrangements are not necessarily associated with
an inferior prognosis when treated with R-CHOP therapy,
unlike DLBCL patients with concurrent MYC/BCL2
rearrangements, probably due to different pathogenesis
and MYC expression levels. In addition, DLBCL patients
with MYC/BCL6 coexpression did have an inferior
prognosis, but only in the presence of MYC/BCL2
coexpression, and therefore MYC/BCL6 coexpression
seems to be of less prognostic importance [46]. These
data support the notion that DLBCL with concurrent MYC/
BCL6 rearrangements and DLBCL with MYC/BCL2 DHL
are not equivalent prognostically. These results suggest
that the concept of double-hit lymphoma needs to be
refined. The grouping of cases of DLBCL with concurrent
MYC/BCL6 rearrangements with cases of DLBCL with
MYC/BCL2 rearrangements may lead to over treatment of
MYC/BCL6 rearranged DLBCL patients.

Tissue microarray, immunohistochemistry and
fluorescence in situ hybridization
Construction of tissue microarrays, IHC staining
procedures on tissue microarray sections, and scoring
criteria for MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 have been described
previously [23, 44, 47]. MYC (clone Y69; Epitomics,
Burlingame, CA) and BCL6 (clone LN22; Leica
Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) expression showed a
distinct nuclear pattern and BCL2 (clone 124; DAKO,
Denmark) expression exhibited a cytoplasmic pattern.
Cutoffs for MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 overexpression are
determined as ≥70%, ≥70%, and > 50% respectively based
on survival analysis as described previously, and cutoffs
and positivity rates reported by other study groups.
Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
analysis was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue sections and BCL2 and BCL6 dual-color,
break-apart probes (Vysis), IGH/MYC/CEP8 tricolor dualfusion probes (Vysis) and a locus specific MYC dual-color
break-apart probe (Vysis) as described previously [47].

Gene expression profiling and COO classification
Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed
on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples
using Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 Plus Version 2.0
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as described in an earlier
study [47]. The CEL files are deposited in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression
Omnibus repository (GSE#31312).61 The microarray
data were quantified and normalized by the frozen robust
multiarray analysis (RMA) algorithm [48]. Differential
expression gene (DEG) analysis was performed using
multiple t-tests [31, 47]. Cell-of-origin classification into
either GCB or ABC subtypes was achieved by using either
GEP (n = 497) or IHC methods (n = 401) according to
the Visco-Young (first selection) and Choi (the second
selection) algorithms [49-53].

Clinical and laboratory features of DLBCL
patients at the time of presentation according to different
subgroups were compared using the chi-squared test and
the Spearman rank correlation test. Overall survival (OS)
was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of
last follow-up or death. Progression-free survival (PFS)
was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the time
of progression or death. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were used to estimate OS and PFS rates, and the logrank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to assess differences in
survival between groups. Multivariate analysis for survival
was performed with IBM statistics SPSS 19 software using
the Cox proportional hazards regression model (Chicago,
SPSS Inc.). All differences with P≤0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant.
