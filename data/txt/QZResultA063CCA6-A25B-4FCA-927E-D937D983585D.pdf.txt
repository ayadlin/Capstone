Abstract

Introduction

Mapping of protein signaling networks within tumors can
identify new targets for therapy and provide a means to
stratify patients for individualized therapy. Despite advances
in combination chemotherapy, the overall survival for
childhood rhabdomyosarcoma remains f60%. A critical goal
is to identify functionally important protein signaling defects
associated with treatment failure for the 40% nonresponder
cohort. Here, we show, by phosphoproteomic network analysis
of microdissected tumor cells, that interlinked components of
the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
exhibited increased levels of phosphorylation for tumors of
patients with short-term survival. Specimens (n = 59) were
obtained from the Children’s Oncology Group Intergroup
Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) IV, D9502 and D9803, with 12year follow-up. High phosphorylation levels were associated
with poor overall and poor disease-free survival: Akt Ser473
(overall survival P < 0.001, recurrence-free survival P <
0.0009), 4EBP1 Thr37/46 (overall survival P < 0.0110, recurrence-free survival P < 0.0106), eIF4G Ser1108 (overall survival
P < 0.0017, recurrence-free survival P < 0.0072), and p70S6
Thr389 (overall survival P < 0.0085, recurrence-free survival P <
0.0296). Moreover, the findings support an altered interrelationship between the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) and
Akt/mTOR pathway proteins (P < 0.0027) for tumors from
patients with poor survival. The functional significance of this
pathway was tested using CCI-779 in a mouse xenograft model.
CCI-779 suppressed phosphorylation of mTOR downstream
proteins and greatly reduced the growth of two different
rhabdomyosarcoma (RD embryonal P = 0.00008; Rh30 alveolar
P = 0.0002) cell lines compared with controls. These results
suggest that phosphoprotein mapping of the Akt/mTOR
pathway should be studied further as a means to select
patients to receive mTOR/IRS pathway inhibitors before
administration of chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3431–40]

Rhabdomyosarcoma arises from undifferentiated mesenchymal
cells bearing skeletal muscle features (1, 2). Rhabdomyosarcoma is
the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, consisting of
three histologic subtypes—alveolar, embryonal, and botyroid.
Despite the recent advances in combination chemotherapy, and
the molecular knowledge of the translocations t(2;13)(q35;q14) and
t(1;13)(p36;q14) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the overall survival
of all patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has remained
in the range of 60% to 70% (3, 4).
The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) completed a series of
treatment protocols evaluating the activity of a combination
regimen using vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide
(VAC), VA plus ifosfamide (VAI), or VI and etoposide (VIE) in
newly diagnosed children who presented with nonmetastatic
rhabdomyosarcoma (3, 4). IRS-IV accrued patients between 1991
and 1997 with patients randomized to chemotherapy regimens
(except for those with group I paratesticular and group I/II orbital
primary tumors and patients with preexisting renal dysfunction).
Additionally, patients were randomized to conventional or hyperfractionated radiotherapy for patients with group III disease.
No difference in outcome was seen among the chemotherapy
regimens or between the radiotherapy regimens for group III
patients (4).
D9502 was a pilot study to assess the feasibility of cyclophosphamide dose intensification during the first 12 weeks of VAC
therapy for patients with intermediate risk rhabdomyosarcoma.
Dose intensification therapy did not result in outcome differences
compared with VAC with lower cyclophosphamide cycle doses (3).
D9803 is an on-going study comparing VAC to VAC alternating
with vincristine, topotecan, and cyclophosphamide for patients
with intermediate risk rhabdomyosarcoma.
The overall disease-free survival rate in these studies was 67%,
but the newer VA plus ifosfamide or VI and etoposide combinations did not improve overall outcome and survival compared with
the standard VAC regimen (3, 4). Unfortunately, there is no way to
identify the 33% of children destined to fail initial therapy,
regardless of disease stage or histologic subtype. On the other
hand, the 60% to 70% of children that respond to standard therapy
do so exceedingly well, with a vast majority of these patients
currently living disease-free. Consequently, an urgent clinical goal is
to identify functionally important molecular networks associated
with the 30% to 40% nonresponder rhabdomyosarcoma subjects to
develop new treatment strategies for this group. Because kinases
are important drug targets, kinase network information could

become the basis of therapeutic strategies for improving treatment
outcome (5).
Although gene microarrays can provide important information
about somatic genetic taxonomy, they are unable to provide an
effective recapitulation of the posttranslational, fluctuating signaling events that occur at the proteomic level. The phosphorylation,
or activation state, of kinase-driven signaling networks contains
important information concerning both the disease pathogenesis
as well as potential for therapeutic target selection (5, 6). It is for
this reason that modulation of ongoing cellular kinase activity
represents one of the most rapidly growing arenas in new drug
development (7). The phosphorylation status of proteins can be
detected and measured using specific antiphosphoprotein antibodies. Antibodies have been developed to specifically recognize
the phosphorylated isoform of kinase substrates. Through the use
of these phosphospecific antibodies, it is now possible to evaluate

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

the state of entire portions of a signaling pathway or cascade,
although the cell is lysed, by looking at dozens of kinase substrates
at once through multiplexed phosphospecific antibody analysis
(5, 8, 9). Applying these antibodies to reverse-phase protein arrays
provides the opportunity to profile the state of the ongoing cellular
signaling events within small numbers of human tumor cells
obtained by biopsy (5, 9, 10). Sandwich two-site antibody pairs are
not available for most phosphorylated epitopes. The advantage of
the reverse phase arrays is that this format requires only one
antibody to measure each phosphorylated epitope.
We applied the reverse phase array phosphoprotein pathway
mapping to evaluate the hypothesis that prosurvival pathways,
including Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), are
differentially activated for rhabdomyosarcoma tumors associated
with a poor versus favorable outcome. A secondary goal was to
functionally test the effect of treatment on the pathway we found to

be activated in a xenograft model of human rhabdomyosarcoma.
This study shows the importance of phosphoprotein cell signaling
events and how they may constitute a new and functionally relevant
analyte for deriving therapeutic insights for rhabdomyosarcoma.

Materials and Methods
Specimens and patient data. All specimens (n = 59) and relevant
clinical data were obtained from the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study
(IRS) IV, D9502 and D9803, studies from the COG with appropriate
institutional review board approval (3, 4).
All specimens were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and procured before
therapy. The sample set was analyzed in two groups, 1A and 1B (Fig. 1A).
Figure 1B to C shows the survival characteristics for the two study sets.
Samples were anonymized and blinded as to clinical survival outcome before
final data analysis. The samples representing study set 1A (Fig. 1A) consisted
of nine snap-frozen surgical specimens and 290 frozen section slides for 33
different patients with a pathologic diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. All
patients used here had stage III (tumors <5 cm or regional lymph node
involvement) disease and group III tumors (gross residual disease remaining
after treatment) before study entry. An additional set of 26 frozen section
samples and clinical data were provided by the COG for patients from the
same protocols (Fig. 1A). Pathologic diagnosis was rendered before therapy.
An independent board-certified pathologist verified the diagnosis before
laser capture microdissection. The histologic subtypes represented alveolar,

embryonal, botryoid, and mixed morphologic types. Pure tumor cell populations were microdissected from the tissue sections with a PixCell II laser
capture microdissection instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
Reverse phase protein microarrays. The microdissected cells (5, 9, 10)
were subjected to lysis and reverse phase protein microarrays were printed
in duplicate with the whole-cell protein lysates as described by Sheehan
et al. (10). Briefly, the lysates were printed on glass backed nitrocellulose
array slides (FAST Slides Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) using a GMS 417
arrayer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with 500 Am pins. Each
lysate was printed in a dilution curve representing neat, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16,
and negative control dilutions. The slides were stored with desiccant
(Drierite, W.A. Hammond, Xenia, OH) at 20jC before immunostaining.
Protein microarray immunostaining. Immunostaining was done on an
automated slide stainer per manufacturer’s instructions (Autostainer CSA
kit, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Each slide was incubated with a single primary
antibody at room temperature for 30 min. Polyclonal primary antibodies
were as follows: glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) a/h Tyr279/216
(Invitrogen-Biosource, Carlsbad, CA), BCL-2, HIF-1a (BD, Franklin Lakes,
NJ), 4EBP1, FKHR ser256, eIF4E, eIF4E ser209, eIF4G, eIF4G Ser1108, IGFR-h,
IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-1 Ser612, SGK, Bak, Bax, BAD, BAD Ser112, BAD Ser136, BAD
Ser155, B-Raf, mTOR, mTOR Ser2448, p70S6 Thr389, p70S6 kinase, p70S6 Ser371,
S6 kinase Ser240/244, Akt, Akt Ser473, Akt Thr308, 4EBP1 Ser65, 4EBP1 Ser70, and
4EBP1 Thr37/46 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The negative
control slide was incubated with antibody diluent. Secondary antibody was
goat anti-rabbit IgG H+L (1:5,000; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA).

two major clusters of tumors (rows ). These clusters seem unrelated to clinical parameters in (B). The two clusters were compared by Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.05.
Five samples were excluded from analysis due to values below the limit of detection, precluding sample ranking.

integrated over a fixed area. Local area background intensity was calculated
for each spot with the unprinted adjacent slide background. This resulted in
a single data point for each sample, for comparison with every other spot on
the array. The Ward method for two-way hierarchical clustering was done
using JMP v5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum
test was used to compare values between two groups. P values <0.05 were
considered significant. When we could not assume a normal distribution of
the variables, we used nonparametric methods. We used Kaplan-Meier (logrank) survival estimates for univariate survival analysis.
In vivo xenograft tumor model. Animal studies were done in
accordance with guidelines of the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee.
Female 4- to 6-week-old beige-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)
mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).
Two million viable cells harvested from mid confluent cultures of either
Rh30 alveolar or RD embryonal cells in 0.2 mL diluent (5% Tween 80, 5%
polyethylene glycol 400; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were injected orthotopically
into the gastrocnemius muscle in the left hind leg, and after 1 week mice
were randomly assigned to control (n = 8) or CCI-779 treatment groups
(n = 8). Mice were treated i.p. every 3 days for 30 consecutive days with
20 mg/kg/i.p. of CCI-779 (Developmental Therapeutics Program, National
Cancer Institute and Wyeth, Madison, NJ) or vehicle alone. Tumor growth
was measured every 3 days with calipers, and tumor volume was calculated
by the formula V (mm3) = a  b 2, where a is the longest tumor axis and b is
the shortest tumor axis. All mice were sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2
and underwent necropsy for confirmation of tumor growth. Tumors were
excised and snap frozen at 80jC until analysis.

Figure 3. Reverse phase protein microarray kinase pathway profiling results for
rhabdomyosarcoma sample set 1A. A, 4EBP1 and 4EBP1 Thr37/46 showed a
statistically significant correlation for segregation of nonsurvivor and survivor
status in study set 1A (4EBP1 Wilcoxon one-way m2, 0.0064; degree of freedom,
1; n = 32; nonsurvivor mean 4EBP1, 82.4; SE, 11.48; survivor mean 4EBP1,
145.61; SE, = 14.89; 4EBP1 Thr37/46 m2, 0.0135, degree of freedom, 1; n = 33).
B, decision tree analysis indicated 4EBPI was a discriminator for survival in study
set 1A; therefore, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for 4EBP1 were calculated.
The Kaplan-Meier plots indicated relatively high levels of 4EBP1 (red line ) had a
significant statistical correlation with overall survival [log-rank P < 0.0177, n = 32
(data not usable for one sample)] and recurrence-free survival (P = 0.0370)
compared with samples with relatively low 4EBP1 levels (blue line ) for patients
at time of last contact.

scanned; spot intensity was analyzed; data were normalized; and a

1A. Enrichment of tumor cells by laser capture microdissection
was done before analysis to ensure that the cells for analysis came
from within the cancer cell population, without contamination by
noncancer cells (5, 11). For study set 1A (n = 33), 15 specific
signaling proteins (Fig. 2A) were initially chosen for reverse phase
protein microarray analysis because they constituted a broad survey
of multiple prosurvival related events related to the Akt/mTOR
pathways that have been shown to play a role in rhabdomyosarcoma (12, 13). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the
15 protein end points revealed two major classes of tumors: one
cluster with Akt/mTOR activation/phosphorylation and the other
with a comparatively low level of signaling (Fig. 2A). After clinical
outcome data was obtained from the COG, these two clusters were
compared by Fisher’s exact test based on patient characteristics of
age, sex, primary site, histology, invasion, and lymph node
involvement (Fig. 2B; ref. 14). Although none of the characteristics
reached P < 0.05 statistical significance, patients with parameningeal head and neck primary site tumors comprised 62% of
cluster 1, whereas cluster 2 had 27% of patients with parameningeal
primary site tumors (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.06). Additionally,
cluster 2 contained 73% alveolar tumors, whereas cluster 1 had 62%
embryonal tumors (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.06). Typically, patients
with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma tumors from orbital or nonparameningeal sites have the best prognosis (15). These two clusters
were not statistically different for commonly accepted prognostic/
clinical factors associated with rhabdomyosarcoma.
We proceeded to correlate the protein analyte values with
disease-free and overall survival clinical outcome data provided by
the COG for study set 1A. A clear partitioning of the tumors
emerged after clinical outcome data was obtained from the COG. A
decision tree analysis of three proteins—4EBP1, phosphorylated
4EBP1 Thr37/46, and eIF4E—all components of the Akt/mTOR
pathway, partitioned patients who were in continuous complete
remission from those who recurred and died after being treated

with standard therapy (data not shown). Among these end points,
4EBP1 and 4EBP1 Thr37/46 individually were found to be
significantly correlated with survival by Wilcoxon one-way analysis,
4EBP1 (P < 0.0064) and 4EBP1 Thr37/46 (P < 0.0135; Fig. 3A). A logrank univariate survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) supported the
association of 4EBP1 with outcome in overall and recurrence-free
survival in study set 1A (Fig. 3B; overall survival P = 0.0177,
recurrence-free survival P = 0.0370; ref. 16).
For recurrence-free survival in study set 1A, 4EBP1 level (P 2 =
0.0074; hazard ratio, 7.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–32.36)
emerged as significant prognostic factor (17, 18). Thus, for study set
1A (Figs. 1–3), individual components within the Akt/mTOR
pathway seemed to correlate with survival.

Disease-free and overall survival in rhabdomyosarcoma
patients is associated with phosphorylated components of
the Akt and mTOR pathways. Based on the findings of study set
1A, an independent set of samples (set 1B, Fig. 1A) were obtained
from COG (n = 26) for analysis of an expanded set of proteins
associated with the Akt/mTOR pathway. Univariate log-rank
analysis of the two heterogeneous sample sets (set 1A and 1B)
revealed no significant difference in overall or recurrence-free
survival by sample set (overall survival P = 0.2111, recurrence-free
survival P = 0.5824; Fig. 1B) or histology (overall survival P = 0.4103,
recurrence-free survival P = 0.4312; Fig. 1C). We analyzed set 1B by
laser capture microdissection and reverse phase protein microarray
as in set 1A. We expanded the number of end points to 27 to include

relatively high levels of the indicated protein end point; blue line, relative low levels. B, protein end points evaluated by reverse phase protein microarray for
rhabdomyosarcoma sample set 1B (open columns, survivor status; filled columns, nonsurvivor status). 4EBP1 Thr37/46 (P < 0.0348), GSK3a/h Tyr279/216 (P < 0.0348),
eIF4G Ser1108 (P < 0.0196), Akt Ser473 (P < 0.0227), Bak (P < 0.0321), and p70S6 Thr389 (P < 0.0373) were found to be statistically significantly associated with
overall survival by Wilcoxon one-way analysis. Columns, mean; bars, SE. Total and phosphorylated forms were independently evaluated. Although the phosphorylated
form of the seven end points reached the level of statistical significance as indicated, the total protein for the same end points did not reach statistical significance,
except in the case of total Akt (P < 0.0455). Data for all 27 end points is indicated in Supplementary Data.

mTOR pathway proteins in sample set 1B (Fig. 1A). Spearman’s Rho table of selected prosurvival and apoptotic signaling proteins evaluated for sample set 1B

are made between the total and phosphorylated form of the indicated end points. The phosphorylated form reaches a level of statistical significance (P < 0.05)

mTOR for an independent evaluation of pathway activation.
Following unblinding of the data, the results for study set 1B
(Fig. 4) showed a significant association of disease-free and overall
survival with phosphorylated components of the Akt-mTOR
pathway. High levels of Akt Ser473, 4EBP1 Thr37/46, eIF4G Ser1108,
and p70S6 Thr389 were all significantly associated with poor overall
and poor disease-free survival: Akt Ser473 (overall survival P < 0.001,
recurrence-free survival P < 0.0009), 4EBP1 Thr37/46 (overall survival
P < 0.0110, recurrence-free survival P < 0.0106), eIF4G Ser1108

IRS-1/Akt/mTOR feedback loop is dysregulated in nonsurvivor cohort. Although tyrosine phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) activates Akt/mTOR signaling through
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), serine phosphorylation of
IRS-1 at serine612 by mTOR and p70S6 down-regulates IRS-1 tyrosine
activation (19–21). Thus, IRS-1 is subject to negative feedback
regulation in response to Akt/mTOR activation (Fig. 5A). We
examined levels of phosphorylated members of the IRS-1/Akt/
mTOR feedback loop by reverse phase protein microarray for

the tumors in study set 1B (n = 26). Although levels of IRS-1 Ser612
were no different between the survivors and nonsurvivors,
phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser612 correlated strongly with phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 in the survivor cohort (Spearman’s Rho
nonparametric P < 0.0027), suggesting a linkage between these two
signaling events (Fig. 5B). By contrast, the phosphorylation of these
same two signaling proteins was not correlated in the nonsurvivor
cohort (Spearman’s Rho nonparametric P = 0.7358; Fig. 5B–C). This
lack of correlation with IRS-1 Ser612 phosphorylation also prevailed
for the mTOR downstream components eIF4E Ser209 (survivor P =
0.0006, nonsurvivor P = 0.102) and p70S6 Thr389 (survivor P =
0.00004, nonsurvivor P = 0.1827; Fig. 5B and D). Thus, the interrelationship between IRS-1 activity and the mTOR pathway proteins
may be altered in the tumors of patients, which subsequently are
found to have poor survival after chemotherapy compared with the
tumors of patients who have long-term survival (Fig. 5A–D).
Interrogation of the phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated state of proteins. Phosphorylation is an important

posttranslational modification that has potential significance as a
readout for the activation state of pathways and kinase inhibitor
targets. To further investigate potential significant cell signaling
proteins within the IRS-1/Akt/mTOR pathway, we extended our
analysis to include the following additional end points: BAD, eIF4G,
IRS-1, IRS-2, IGFR-h, and S6 Ser240/244. We conducted Wilcoxon oneway analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the phosphorylated protein, the total protein form, and the ratio of the
phosphorylated to total forms of key protein end points (Fig. 5B;
Supplementary Data). The results clearly show that the specific
phosphorylated forms of the protein end points within the AktmTOR and associated pathways are independently associated with

important distinction because it is likely that the population of the

the phosphorylated form. The phosphorylated form, actively

engaged in signaling, constitutes a subpopulation of the total
protein. Thus, the phosphorylated form constitutes a variable that is
independently correlated with survival compared with the total
protein (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data).
Suppression of the mTOR pathway in a mouse xenograft
model reduces tumor growth. To validate the functional
significance of our IRS-1/Akt/mTOR network analysis, we used
rapamycin analogues, which are well-characterized inhibitors of
the mTOR protein kinase pathway, using a mouse xenograft
treatment model. Either RD embryonal cells or Rh30 alveolar cells
were injected orthotopically into the hind leg of beige SCID mice.
These two different cell lines were used to determine the effects of
mTOR inhibition in different histologic tumor categories. The
rapamycin analogue CCI-779 (Wyeth, Madison, NJ) dosage was 20
mg/kg, which corresponds to dosages currently administered to
humans in phase I and II clinical trials (22, 23). Administration of
CCI-779 at doses that were verified to suppress the phosphorylation of mTOR downstream targets profoundly reduced the growth
of rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts as measured in the beige SCID
murine model (Rh30 xenograft group P = 0.0002; RD xenograft
group P = 0.00008, n = 8 for both groups; Fig. 6A–D). Suppression of
the mTOR pathway was monitored by measuring the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6 ribosomal protein, which are wellestablished downstream targets of mTOR (12). CCI-779 inhibited
the phosphorylation of these downstream targets commensurate
with a blockade in mTOR signaling in both the Rh30 alveolar– and
RD embryonal xenograft–derived tumors. In addition, there was a
slight but definite increase in phosphorylated Akt at Ser473 in both
the RD and Rh30 xenograft tumors over the course of treatment
with CCI-779 (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Recent real-time reverse transcription-PCR and fluorescence
in situ hybridization assays for PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion
transcripts have been developed and applied to rhabdomyosarcoma. Nevertheless, genomic and transcriptomic assays do not
provide an effective recapitulation of the posttranslational,
fluctuating signaling events that occur at the proteomic level
(24–26). Therefore, we used reverse phase protein microarrays as a
means of monitoring the in vivo state of selected kinase pathways.
In the present investigation, analysis of protein signaling
pathways was conducted blinded to treatment or survival using
two independent rhabdomyosarcoma tumor study sets for which
12-year follow-up data was available. Two independent study sets
(Fig. 1A) were procured randomly from the pool of frozen
specimens. Each study set represented a variety of treatment
modalities, histologic subtypes, and tumor sites. The two sets
differed in the proportion of samples with alveolar versus
embryonal histology (Fig. 1A and C; refs. 3, 4). Although the
sample sets were heterogeneous, there was no statistically
significant difference in either overall survival or recurrence-free
survival between the two sample sets (overall survival P = 0.2111,
recurrence-free survival P = 0.5824; Fig. 1B).
Current prognostic indicators for patients diagnosed with
rhabdomyosarcoma are age, stage, group, histology, and primary
site, with patients in the 1- to 8-year age group with embryonal
rhabdomyosarcoma from orbital or nonparameningeal head and
neck sites having the best prognosis (15). Using unsupervised
clustering analysis, we sought to determine if any protein signaling
signature correlated with histologic subtype. For the first study set,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

15 specific signaling proteins (Figs. 2A and 3A) were initially
chosen because they constituted a broad survey of multiple
prosurvival-related events. A multiplexed measurement of the
chosen phosphorylation states provided an averaged portrait of the
ongoing kinase activity events within selected networks that drive
cellular growth or survival.
The initial unsupervised clustering analysis was not significantly
associated with histology but there was clear partitioning of the
samples into two clusters, with one cluster exhibiting activation of
Akt/mTOR proteins (Fig. 2A). Therefore, clinical outcome data was
obtained from the COG for further exploratory associations
between the protein end points and clinical data. The results of
set 1A revealed a statistically significant association between
survival and the activation/suppression of proteins linked to the
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Fig. 3A–B).
Based on the results of set 1A, we expanded this exploratory
analysis to 27 end points applied to a second independent set of
samples (Fig. 1A; and Supplementary Data). Proteins that seemed
to correlate with survival or failure in the second study set were
linked together in the Akt/mTOR kinase pathway (12, 27, 28).
Phosphorylated components of the Akt/mTOR pathway, specifically Akt, eIF4G, 4EBP1 (elongation binding factor), GSK3a/h,
and p70S6 were found to be associated with outcome (Fig. 4B).
IRS-1, Akt, and GSK3h are associated with cell growth, survival,
insulin response, and glucose metabolism. mTOR, 4EBP1, and
p70S6 are essential components of protein translation, in which
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 releases 4EBP1 from eIF4E, activating
cap-dependent translation (29). These pathways are involved
in the regulation of prosurvival and translation for a group of
proteins that are important for cell cycle and apoptosis, including
several known oncogenes such as cyclin D, c-myc, and Hif-1a (30).
Although Akt Ser473 correlated with survival (P < 0.02) for study
set 1B, it did not correlate with survival in set 1A (P = 0.2460).
This may have been due to differences in the relative composition of tumor histologies and sites of origin between the two
groups (Fig. 1A).
A variety of autocrine and paracrine stimuli, including hormones,
growth factors, mitogens, cytokines, and G-protein–coupled
receptor agonists, elicit 4EBP1 hyperphosphorylation and concomitant loss of eIF4E-binding activity in the mTOR pathway (12, 27, 28,
30). Activation of PI3K or the downstream effector kinase Akt leads
to 4EBP1 hyperphosphorylation, affecting its release from eIF4E.
Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 on multiple loci is associated with
linkage to the insulin receptor pathway and the PI3K pathway. Six
phosphorylation sites have been identified on 4EBP1. Thr37, Thr46,
Ser65, and Thr70 become phosphorylated after insulin stimulation,
and such phosphorylation can be blocked by rapamycin (inhibitor
of mTOR) and wortmannin (inhibitor of PI3K; refs. 31, 32). It has
been shown that mTOR itself, as well as an mTOR-associated
kinase, directly phosphorylates sites on 4EBP1. Gingras et al. (31)
established that phosphate groups are first added to Thr37 and
Thr46. This priming phosphorylation is required for the phosphorylation of other sites necessary for binding. Thus, multiple
phosphorylation events triggered from multiple kinases, primed
by Thr37/46, are involved in the release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E.
Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 activates Akt/mTOR signaling
through PI3K, serine phosphorylates IRS-1 (at Ser612) by mTOR,
and p70S6 down-regulates IRS-1 tyrosine activation (19–21). Thus,
it is hypothesized that IRS-1 is subject to negative feedback
regulation in response to Akt/mTOR activation through p70S6
(Fig. 5A; ref. 33). Based on this negative feedback between mTOR

Akt/mTOR Pathway and Rhabdomyosarcoma Survival

and IRS-1, O’Reilly et al. (33) recently hypothesized that inhibition
of mTOR may cause augmented phosphorylation of Akt through
disruption of the negative feedback loop between p70S6 and IRS-1.
We examined the IRS-1 feedback loop interrelationship with
components of the Akt and mTOR pathway by nonparametric
correlations (Fig. 5B–D). Interrogation of IRS-1 Ser612 and various
potential interacting proteins provided a means to assess the
protein interactions with the actual phosphorylation site involved
in the negative feedback regulation of IRS-1 (20, 21). The average
level of IRS-1 Ser12 was not statistically different (P < 0.098)
between tumors from patients with favorable outcome compared
with those with poor outcome (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the level
of IRS-1 upstream activity was similar. Although the average level
of IRS-1 Ser612 phosphorylation was similar in the favorable
versus poor outcome cases, the correlation of individual IRS-1
phosphorylation levels in each tumor with phosphorylation levels
of Akt and mTOR pathway proteins was highly dissimilar in these
two phenotypes. In addition Bak, FKHR Ser256, and IGFR-h were
significantly correlated for both groups (Supplementary Data). As
shown in Fig. 5, there was a strong positive correlation (P =
0.00269) of IRS-1 Ser612 with mTOR Ser2448 and with p70S6 Thr289
(P = 0.00004) in tumors with favorable outcome (Fig. 5B and C).
This suggests a linkage or correlation consistent with a feedback
loop between mTOR and IRS-1 in these tumors with favorable
outcomes. These data support a selective alteration in the active
interrelationship between IRS-Ser612 and downstream components of the mTOR pathway in tumors with poor outcome.
The implications of these differences in the IRS-Akt-mTOR
interconnectivity of survivors and nonsurvivors are 2-fold. First,
the apparent lack of interconnection between IRS-1 and mTOR
could disrupt the normal negative feedback regulation as
described (20, 33). This could result in increased phosphorylation
of Akt as we noted in the tumors from patients with poor
outcomes and illustrated in Fig. 5A. Baseline levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR may be elevated in aggressive tumors in
which the negative feedback regulation of mTOR through IRS-1 is
disrupted, or phosphorylation of Akt is supplemented by IRS-1–
independent mechanisms.
The identified 4E-BP1 phosphorylation sites are specifically
inhibited by rapamycin treatment (29, 31). To validate the
functional significance of our network analysis, revealing mTOR
pathway suppression observed in patients who had a favorable
treatment outcome, we exploited the existence of rapamycin
analogues, which are well-characterized inhibitors of the mTOR
protein kinase pathway. Some of these analogues are currently in
phase I and II clinical trials of adults with cancer (22, 23).
Suppression of the mTOR pathway was monitored by measuring
the state of phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6 kinase, which are
well-established downstream substrates of mTOR (12, 27, 28, 30,
31). CCI-779 inhibited the expected phosphorylation of the
downstream targets commensurate with a blockade in mTOR
signaling in xenograft tumors derived from Rh30 alveolar or RD
embryonal cells (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of Akt was present in
both of these cell lines grown in vivo (Fig. 6D) and there was a
slight increase in the RH30 (alveolar) xenograft and a perceptible
augmentation in the RD (embryonal) xenograft of phosphorylated
Akt on Ser473 over time during CCI-779 treatment (Fig. 6D). This is
consistent with the negative feedback loop as described by O’Reilly
et al. (33). The growth of both histologic tumor types was inhibited
by CCI-779 treatment. In Fig. 4, both embryonal and alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes were represented in the cohort with

www.aacrjournals.org

poor outcomes, which had higher levels of mTOR pathway
activation.
The findings in the present study for both the patient’s tumor
tissue and the xenograft model are supported and complemented
by small interfering RNA S6K1 knockdown experiments in Rh30
and RD cell lines (34). Both the patient tumor and mouse xenograft findings (Figs. 5B–D and 6) support a key regulation of
Akt signaling through mTOR and IGF-IRS-1 as shown by
the correlation between IRS-1 Ser612 and other members of these
pathways. Moreover, a recent report from the COG using
oligonucleotide gene expression analysis revealed an association
of elevated platelet-derived growth factor receptor and insulin-like
growth factor gene transcripts with decreased survival for patients
from the IRS-IV study set (35). Our finding of an increased amount
of total IGFR-h associated with poor survival (Fig. 5B) is in keeping
with this finding. Thus, the present data support the conclusion of
Wan et al. (34) that an optimal therapy strategy would be to
combine an mTOR inhibitor with an IGF-IR antibody (or small
molecule) inhibitor.
The IGF-I/Akt/mTOR pathway found herein to be associated
with rhabdomyosarcoma has previously been associated with
regulation of hypertrophy and atrophy of muscle, the cellular
progenitor of rhabdomyosarcoma Song et al. (36) have reported
that IGF-I, via the mTOR pathway, regulates angiotensin II–
induced skeletal muscle wasting. Rat skeletal muscle atrophy is
associated with inactivation of the mTOR pathway. Activation of
the mTOR pathway is also associated with active remodeling of
the heart in vivo and protection against atrophy, whereas
rapamycin treatment of rat hearts augmented atrophy (37).
Cardiac myocyte reperfusion after transient ischemia induced by
reversible occlusion was associated with activation of the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway (38). Reperfusion was associated with
activation of Akt and phosphorylation of GSK3h, and associated
stimulation of signaling through mTOR as evidenced by
phosphorylation of eIF4E and S6 kinase. Activation of the mTOR
pathway and phosphorylation of S6K1 is also associated with
hypertrophy and pressure overload hypertrophy. Post ischemia,
surviving myocytes undergo 10% to 15% hypertrophy (39).
Phosphorylation of S6K1 was unaltered during ischemia but
increased during reperfusion (38).
These results in nonneoplastic muscle indicate that a physiologic
cycle of ischemia followed by reperfusion activates the Akt/mTOR
pathway, is associated with myocyte hypertrophy, and protects
against atrophy. This may be relevant during the precursor state
before neoplastic growth, but they may also apply to cycles of
ischemia, necrosis, and angiogenesis associated with aggressive
neoplastic growth. Because rhabdomyosarcoma is thought to arise
from a myocyte lineage, signaling pathways involved in normal
muscle cell regrowth/remodeling could be similar to those involved
in tumorigenesis.
Mirk, a protein recently identified to possess antiapoptotic
functions in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and tumors, exhibits
both prosurvival and growth arrest functions in differentiating
skeletal myoblasts (40, 41). Mirk has been shown to be activated by
MKK3, a stress-activated mitogen-activated kinase kinase (42).
RNA interference (RNAi) depletion of endogenous Mirk reduced
the clonogenicity of RD embryonal and Rh30 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines in colony formation experiments, indicating a
prosurvival role in rhabdomyosarcoma (41). In addition, RNAi
depletion of Mirk has been shown to block myoblast differentiation
in skeletal muscle primary cell culture (40). These findings further

strengthen the role of cell survival mechanisms in rhabdomyosarcoma and muscle development.
In summary, protein pathway analysis of microdissected human
rhabdomyosarcoma clinical specimens, procured before treatment, revealed a strong association between activation (phosphorylation) of multiple interconnected Akt/mTOR pathway
components and a poor disease-free or overall survival in this
initial, exploratory analysis. This observation was found to be
consistent between two independently analyzed clinical study sets.
Moreover, the functional significance of IRS-1/Akt/mTOR pathway
activation in rhabdomyosarcoma was verified using the specific
targeted inhibitor CCI-779 to suppress tumor growth in a beige
SCID rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft model. These data provide
impetus for testing rapamycin analogues in this tumor type as a
potential way to modulate poor prognosis patients into more
durable outcomes. In support of this combination therapy
concept, MacKiegan et al. (43) used RNAi libraries to search for
