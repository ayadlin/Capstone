Abstract
The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of negative
regulatory proteins is up-regulated in response to several
cytokines and pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMP) and suppresses cellular signaling responses by
binding receptor phosphotyrosine residues. Exposure of bone
marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDC) to 1D8 cells, a murine
model of ovarian carcinoma, suppresses their ability to
express CD40 and stimulate antigen-specific responses in
response to PAMPs and, in particular, to polyinosinic
acid:poly-CMP (polyI:C) with the up-regulated SOCS3 transcript and protein levels. The ectopic expression of SOCS3 in
both the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and BMDCs
decreased signaling in response to both polyI:C and IFNA.
Further, knockdown of SOCS3 transcripts significantly enhanced the responses of RAW264.7 and BMDCs to both polyI:C
and IFNA. Immunoprecipitation and pull-down studies show
that SOCS3 binds to the IFNA receptor tyrosine kinase 2
(TYK2). Because polyI:C triggers autocrine IFNA signaling,
binding of SOCS3 to TYK2 may thereby suppress the activation
of BMDCs by polyI:C and IFNA. Thus, elevated levels of SOCS3
in tumor-associated DCs may potentially resist the signals
induced by Toll-like receptor 3 ligands and type I IFN to
decrease DC activation via binding with IFNA receptor TYK2.

Introduction
Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are rapidly
induced by cytokines and represent classic feedback inhibitors
(1–3). The eight members of the SOCS protein family are SOCS1 to
SOCS7 and cytokine-inducible Src homology domain 2 (SH2)containing protein. Each has a central SH2 domain that targets the
SOCS protein to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated
cytokine receptors or the associated Janus-activated kinase (JAK),
and thereby down-regulates signaling. SOCS3 is transiently induced
by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and by a wide variety of
cytokines, including IFNg, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-10.
The rapid induction of SOCS3 by IL-10 is signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) dependent, especially in the
presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; refs. 1, 2, 4). SOCS3
contributes to the inhibition of both macrophage activation and
inflammatory cytokine production (1). In vitro studies have also

proposed roles for SOCS3 in growth hormone function, IL-2–
dependent T-cell proliferation, as well as leptin, IL-10–dependent
signaling (1). SOCS3 inhibits IL-1 signaling by targeting the
TRAF-6/TAK1 complex (5), whereas SOCS3-mediated inhibition
of Epo receptor (EpoR), gp130, and leptin receptor (LeptinR)
signaling occurs via competitive inhibition of SHP-2 binding to
Y759 of gp130 (6), Y895 of LeptinR (7), and Y401 of EpoR (8),
resulting in the blockade of SHP-2–mediated extracellular signalregulated kinase activation. The high-affinity interaction of SOCS3
with gp130 through its SH2 domain and with JAKs through its
kinase inhibitory region provides specificity to inhibition of gp130
signaling (9). Thus, these proteins are critical regulators of cytokine
signaling and JAK/STAT pathway.
Dendritic cells (DC) play a central role in innate and adaptive
immune responses and are subject to both negative and positive
regulation. Toll-like receptor ligands (TLRL) activate DCs to secrete
a variety of inflammatory cytokines and promote the expression of
costimulatory molecules. Each TLR mediates distinctive responses
in association with a different combination of five TIR domaincontaining adapters (MyD88, TIRAP/MAL, TRIF, TRAM, and SARM)
through the homophilic interaction of TIR domains (10, 11).
Typically, the TLRL polyinosinic acid:poly-CMP (polyI:C) signals
through TLR3 and TRIF to produce high levels of type I IFN (IFNa;
ref. 12). The TLR signaling pathways are negatively regulated by
IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinase M, SOCS1, MyD88 short,
single immunoglobulin IL-1R–related molecule, and ST2 (13).
SOCS1 has been linked to the negative regulation of TLR signaling
by mediating the degradation of Mal (14). In contrast to TLRLs,
tumor and/or tumor-derived factors can decrease the function of
DCs. Tumor cells prevent mouse DC maturation induced by TLR
ligands (15). Because immune suppression is associated with
ovarian cancer, we explored the effect of the murine model of
ovarian cancer on the response of murine bone marrow–derived
DCs (BMDC) to TLRL. Here, we find that exposure to ovarian tumor
cells elevates SOCS3 expression in BMDCs. These tumor-associated
DCs also exhibit blunted TLR3 signaling that is associated with
binding of SOCS3 to the IFNa receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2).

Materials and Methods
Mice. Four- to 6-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice (Beijing Animal Center) were
maintained in a pathogen-free animal facility at least 1 wk before use.
Experiments were performed in accordance with Institutional Guidelines.
Cells, reagents, antibodies, and flow cytometric analysis. Mouse
bone marrow–derived DCs (BMDCs) were prepared as described previously
(16). Briefly, BMDCs were prepared from bone marrow cells collected by
removing the femur bones of mice, cutting off each end, and flushing out
the bone marrow with RPMI 1640 using a syringe. The pooled cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 600  g for 10 min and resuspended in 2 mL
ACK buffer for 5 min at room temperature to lyse the RBCs. These cells
were washed in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and

1% penicillin/streptomycin and the DCs were cultured in medium
containing 500 units/mL granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(R&D Systems) for 7 d. The monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7
(American Type Culture Collection) was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The mouse
ovarian surface epithelial cell line 1D8 provided by Katherine F. Roby
(University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; ref. 17) was described
in our previous article (18). Expression of the costimulatory molecules
CD40, CD80, CD86, CD22.2, CD72, and CTLA-4 or the surface antigens CD5,
B220, CD11b, and CD11c was not detected on 1D8 (data not shown).
Multiple tumors formed within 60 d after i.p. injection of 1  107 1D8
ovarian carcinoma cells (data not shown) in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. For
the generation of tumor-associated DCs, BMDCs were first cultured alone
for 5 d and then with mouse ovarian surface epithelial tumor cell line 1D8
for further 4 d by staining with FITC-labeled anti-CD80 antibody and sorted
by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickson).
Cells were treated with 25 Ag/mL polyI:C (19), 0.1 Ag/mL LPS (20), and
100 units/mL IFNa for 2 d and then analyzed by flow cytometry or used as
stimulators after loading human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 virus-like
particles (VLP). These doses of TLRLs were used in every experiment
unless otherwise stated. For each analysis, an isotype-matched control

monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used as a negative control. polyI:C, LPS,
and IFNa were purchased from Invivogen and PBL Biomedical Laboratories. To assess surface marker phenotypes of tumor-associated DCs and
control DCs, the cells were collected in ice-cold PBS and incubated with the
following antibodies: FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD86 (GL1), anti-mouse
CD80 (16-10A1), and anti-mouse CD40 (3/23). All of these antibodies were
purchased from PharMingen. Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in PBS with 1% paraformaldehyde and 1% FCS and then kept at 4jC
before flow cytometric analysis.
Preparation of HPV16 VLP-specific splenocytes and assay of
antigen-specific T-cell responses. To determine the VLP-specific T-cell
responses, C57BL/6 mice were immunized in the tail vein with HPV16 VLP
(10 Ag/mouse) or PBS, respectively, on days 0, 7, and 14. On day 24, the
pooled splenic cells were collected and deposited as responders. BMDCs
from different treatments were used as stimulators after loading with
HPV16 VLPs to induce the production of IFNg (16). VLP-specific
splenocytes (2  106) were stimulated by HPV16 VLP-loaded DC. The ratio
of DC to VLP-specific splenocytes was 1:20. After 3 d, the IFNg in the
supernatant was assayed by capture ELISA.

Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. V5-tagged SOCS3
vector–transfected or only plasmid vector–transfected cells were extracted
in hypotonic lysis buffer as previously described. The nuclei were removed
by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 15 min at 4jC, and then the lysate was
precleared with 100 AL of protein G-Sepharose and 20 Ag/mL isotypic
control antibody for 2 h at 4jC. Immunoprecipitation was performed with
anti-V5 antibody and protein G-Sepharose for 16 h at 4jC with slow
agitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with ice-cold lysis

Results
Murine BMDCs exhibit reduced TLR3 signaling and elevated
SOCS3 on exposure to model ovarian cancer. Numerous studies
indicate that the presence of tumor cells alters the phenotype and
functional potential of antigen-presenting cells. Indeed, coculture
of BMDCs with 1D8 ovarian carcinoma cells caused loss of the
typical morphologic character of DCs manifested as fewer
dendrites and rounding (Fig. 1A). Coculture with 1D8 tumor cells
also affects the expression of costimulatory molecules and
generation of cytokines (18) and decreased antigen-presenting
function of BMDCs (Fig. 1B). The exposure of BMDCs to polyI:C
or LPS promoted antigen-specific T-cell activation (Fig. 1B) and
surface CD40 expression (Fig. 1C). However, these responses
were blunted in each case when the BMDCs had been cocultured
with 1D8 tumor cells. This phenomenon was most marked for
stimulation with polyI:C, a TLR3 ligand (Fig. 1B and C). Thus, we
hypothesized that exposure of BMDCs to 1D8 tumor cell–derived
factors caused expression of gene products that blunt TLR
intracellular signaling in general and TLR3 signaling in particular.
To explore this possibility, we used Affymetrix microarray to
compare specific transcript levels in BMDCs that were cocultured

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

with 1D8 tumor cells (ratio of tumor cells to DC was 1:5) or
exposed to 25% (v/v) 1D8 tumor cell–conditioned medium versus
untreated BMDCs. We examined the microarray data set based on
biological process and intracellular signaling cascade and searched
for genes whose expression increased more on coculture with 1D8
(live or irradiated) and with 1D8 conditioned medium. Several
intracellular signaling molecules fitted these criteria [Supplementary Table S1 and microarray data at Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO);5 GEO accession number: GSE10741]. However, the upregulation of SOCS3 was consistent with three independent probe
sets. SOCS3 transcripts were up-regulated 3.31 F 0.51–fold by
coculture with irradiated 1D8 cells, 2.05 F 0.40 by 1D8 cell
coculture, and 1.61 F 0.14 by 1D8 conditioned medium (Supplementary Table S1 and microarray data at GEO; GEO accession
number: GSE10741). SOCS3 has previously been identified as
regulating cellular signaling (3), including TLR signaling (23, 24).
Therefore, we first independently validated the increased SOCS3
expression by BMDCs after exposure to 1D8 tumor cells and
conditioned medium by RT-PCR for SOCS3 transcripts and then by
Western blotting analysis for SOCS3 protein (Fig. 1D). Both transcription and expression of SOCS3 were up-regulated (Fig. 1D).
In vivo evidence showed also that tumor-bearing mice indeed

SOCS3 Suppresses TLR3 Signaling via TYK2

up-regulated SOCS3 in primary DCs from spleen or tumor-draining
lymph nodes. Similar to BMDCs on exposure to tumor, these DCs
isolated from spleens of tumor-bearing mice or tumor-draining
lymph nodes also had decreased antigen-presenting ability and
remarkably reduced responses to polyI:C (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Notably, overexpression of SOCS1, a family member also upregulated in tumor-associated DCs and known to suppress TLR3
signaling (25), was not observed (microarray data at GEO; GEO
accession number: GSE10741; data not shown), suggesting
differential regulation of SOCS family members.
Ectopic SOCS3 expression suppresses TLR3 signaling. To
investigate the relevance of SOCS3 up-regulation in TLR signaling,
we generated stable transfectants of the monocyte/macrophage
RAW264.7 cell line with an expression vector encoding V5-tagged
SOCS3 or control vector. Stable expression of V5-SOCS3 was shown
by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A) with a tag-specific mAb. Stimulation of RAW264.7 cells, stably transfected with either vector alone
or V5-SOCS3 expression vector, with LPS significantly up-regulated
surface CD40 expression (Fig. 2B3 and B4). However, ectopic
V5-SOCS3 expression suppressed the induction of CD40 by polyI:C
(Fig. 2B2). Similar data were obtained for CD80 and CD86, but
these effects were weaker than for CD40 (data not shown).
To further characterize the suppressor function of SOCS3, we
investigated the effect of SOCS3 transcript knockdown with siRNA
on the expression of CD40 by RAW264.7 cells in response to
stimulation by polyI:C. Transfection of RAW264.7 cells with SOCS3targeted but not control siRNA reduced the levels of SOCS3 transcripts and protein without affecting GAPDH transcript or actin

levels (Fig. 3A). SOCS3 knockdown promoted the expression of
CD40 (Fig. 3B) after stimulation with polyI:C.
Inhibitory effect of SOCS3 on the expression of CD40 is
dependent on IFNA. The negative regulation RAW264.7 cell
activation by TLRLs was particularly marked in the case of polyI:C
by comparison with LPS. Because TLR3 activation results in much
higher levels of type I IFN than signaling via TLR2, TLR4, or TLR9
(only TLR4 was shown), we investigate the possible role of type I
IFN in inhibitory effect of SOCS3 on the expression of CD40. As
shown in Fig. 4A, the control RAW264.7 and SOCS3-transfected
RAW264.7 cells produced similar levels of IFNa in response to
polyI:C, suggesting that SOCS3 does not suppress TLR3 signaling
by reducing IFNa production. Therefore, we sought to determine
the influence of elevated or diminished levels of SOCS3 on the
induction of surface CD40 after IFNa stimulation of RAW264.7
cells. Ectopic V5-SOCS3 overexpression reduced surface expression
of CD40 after stimulation of RAW264.7 cells with IFNa. Conversely,
knockdown of endogenous SOCS3 markedly enhanced their levels
(Fig. 4). These findings suggest that SOCS3 acts on autocrine/
paracrine IFNa signaling induced by polyI:C stimulation to
suppress the expression of CD40.
SOCS3 binds to TYK2. The negative regulation of IFNa
signaling in RAW264.7 cells and the presence of an SH2-binding
domain in SOCS3 imply that SOCS3 may potentially interact with
component(s) of the type I IFN pathway to suppress signaling.
Although type I IFN comprises several subtypes of IFNa, a single
gene encoding IFNh as well as IFNH and IFNE each binds to the
type I IFN receptor (IFNR). The type I IFNR is a heterodimer of

studies, lysate of BMDCs was incubated with GST-SOCS3-GFP or
GST-GFP bound on glutathione-Sepharose. TYK2 [but not JAK1
(data not shown)] was detected bound to GST-SOCS3-GFP but not
to GST-GFP (Fig. 5C).
To determine whether ligation of the type I IFNR and TYK2
phosphorylation enhances binding to SOCS3, RAW264.7 cells were
stimulated by IFNa or as a control IFNg. IFNa promoted the
binding of SOCS3 to phospho-TYK2, whereas IFNg did not at 5 min
after stimulation (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, binding of SOCS3 to
phospho-TYK2 promoted by IFNa followed the typical time course
of TYK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5), indicating the binding of SOCS3
to phospho-TYK2. Thus, binding of SOCS3 with phospho-TYK2

might explain suppression of TLR3 and IFNa-induced expression
of CD40.
SOCS3 inhibits activation of DCs by polyI:C and IFNA. To
investigate the action of SOCS3 on antigen presentation, we raised
or lowered the levels of SOCS3 in BMDCs using a nucleofector
method by ectopic V5-SOCS3 overexpression or siRNA-mediated
knockdown of endogenous SOCS3 transcripts, respectively. These
BMDCs were stimulated with either polyI:C or IFNa and cocultured
with antigen-specific splenocytes after loading antigen (VLP). T-cell
activation was assessed by measuring the production of IFNg.
BMDCs transfected with the V5-SOCS3 expression construct
induced low level of production of IFNg by VLP-specific spleen
cells after loading with VLP and stimulation with either polyI:C or
IFNa, whereas pcDNA vector only–transfected DC produced levels
of IFNg similar to control BMDC (Fig. 6). Knockdown of SOCS3
with specific but not irrelevant siRNA dramatically enhanced the
activation of BMDCs induced by both polyI:C and IFNa (Fig. 6).
These findings suggest that SOCS3 is involved in the negative
regulation of DC in activation and antigen-presenting function of
DC induced by polyI:C and IFNa.

Discussion
In this study, we found that expression of SOCS3 is up-regulated
on exposure to murine ovarian carcinoma 1D8 cells. Although it is
unclear what 1D8 tumor-derived factor or factors trigger SOCS3
up-regulation in DCs, several reports describe high-level production of IL-6 and IL-10 in ovarian cancer (26), which are known to

SOCS3 Suppresses TLR3 Signaling via TYK2

induce the expression of SOCS3 (4). The elevated levels of SOCS3 in
tumor-associated DCs inhibit the signals induced by TLR3 ligands
and type I IFN to decrease DC activation via binding with IFNa
receptor TYK2. Thus, our findings suggest that one particular
member of the JAK kinase family, TYK2, is an important target of
SOCS3-mediated suppression in antigen-presenting cells.
The JAK kinase family comprises at least four different tyrosine
kinases (TYK2, JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3) that share significant
structural homology with each other, and therefore, it will be
interesting to determine the reason for the specificity of SOCS3 for
TYK2 as this is in contrast to direct inhibition of all four JAK
kinases by SOCS1 (2, 27). SOCS molecules control cytokine receptor
signaling by several mechanisms (28), including indirect inhibition
of JAKs via binding of SOCS to the cytoplasmic receptor domains
(thereby sterically hindering the constitutive JAK binding to the
receptor chains), competitive inhibition of STAT binding to
receptor chains, and inhibition of downstream signaling pathways.
SOCS proteins can also interact with receptor phosphotyrosine

through their SH2 domains (8, 29, 30). SOCS3 can bind to the
catalytic site of JAK family kinases and inhibit their activity (8, 31).
We here found that the interaction of SOCS3 with TYK2 reduced
both the polyI:C- and IFNa-induced activation of DCs. Thus, SOCS3
induced by ovarian carcinoma cells and tumor supernatants in
antigen-presenting cells may suppress multiple pathways critical to
the induction of tumor-specific immunity, including antigen
presentation and activation by TLRLs and type I IFN.
Type I IFNs have been widely used for the treatment of chronic
infections, including hepatitis C and papillomavirus, and some
cancers, such as melanoma. The effects of type I IFNs on DC
function are contradictory, as some studies show that they promote
the differentiation/activation of DCs (32, 33), whereas others find
inhibitory effects (34–37). Perhaps, inhibition of type I IFN
signaling by SOCS3 could offer an explanation for some of these
contradictions. Type I IFNs have been shown to act as a maturation
factor for DCs (36, 37) when SOCS3 is presumably at a low level.
Notably, the IFNa-induced DC activation and maturation was

enhanced in the presence of anti-IL-10 antibody (38). Because
IL-10 is an effective inducer of SOCS3, enhanced maturation
in the presence of anti-IL-10 may be the result of lower SOCS3
levels.
SOCS3 is a potent negative regulator of multiple proinflammatory pathways (39). Macrophage cytokine production and osteoclast generation were markedly enhanced in the absence of SOCS3.
Enhanced T lymphocyte activation in the absence of SOCS3 may
drive disease and also promote osteoclastogenesis. SOCS3 in
tumor-associated DCs inhibits the signals induced by TLR3 ligands
and type I IFN to decrease DC activation, suggesting that SOCS3
may play an important role in tumor-mediating immune
suppression also.
