BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether progression-free interval (PFI) following primary chemotherapy (PCT)
was predictive of overall survival (OS) after second-line chemotherapy in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer
(EC). METHODS: This is a pooled analysis of patients who recurred after PCT and were treated with second-line
chemotherapy on Gynecologic Oncology Group trials. PFI-1 measured from initiation of PCT to recurrence or treatment-free interval (TFI) measured from completion of PCT to initiation of second-line chemotherapy was evaluated
in relation to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 586 patients treated on 5 phase 3 PCT protocols were included.
Baseline factors in primary setting associated with clinical outcome after PCT were also predictive of OS after second-line chemotherapy, including race, Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status, grade, and prior radiation
therapy (P < .01). PFI-1 was the most significant factor predictive of survival after second-line chemotherapy, with a
30% reduction in the risk of death for PFI-1 >6 months compared with 6 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.84 [P < .0001]) and median OS after second-line chemotherapy of 10 versus 5 months. A
total of 275 patients treated on 9 phase 2 second-line chemotherapy protocols were also evaluated, and TFI >3
months was associated with a 25% reduction in the risk of death (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97 [P ¼ .030]) and median
OS after second-line chemotherapy of 10 versus 7 months compared with TFI 3 months. The tumor response to second-line chemotherapy was 9.6% versus 5.8%; the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Time to
recurrence after PCT is predictive of survival after recurrence in advanced/recurrent EC. However, there is no evidence that

KEYWORDS: endometrial cancer, chemotherapy, Gynecologic Oncology Group, ancillary data analysis, salvage
chemotherapy.

Of all the gynecologic malignancies, endometrial cancer
has undergone the most dramatic shift in management
over the past several years. Key among these is the identification of active chemotherapy regimens and their utilization in a first-line setting for what was once felt to be
chemotherapy-resistant disease. There have been several
randomized studies performed by the Gynecologic
Oncology Group addressing the issue of optimal therapy
for patients with advanced/recurrent disease who have
received no prior chemotherapeutic regimen. Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 107 evaluated doxorubicin alone versus doxorubicin plus cisplatin (AP) and
found the latter to be superior in terms of response rate
(RR) (25% vs 42%; P ¼ .004) and progression-free
survival (PFS) (3.8 vs 5.7 months; hazard ratio [HR]
0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.94), although
no difference in overall survival (OS) was observed (9.0 vs
9.2 months).1 In Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol
122, chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus cisplatin was
compared with whole abdominal radiation (WAR)
therapy in patients with stage III-IV endometrial cancer
with <2-cm residual disease. In that trial, doxorubicin
plus cisplatin produced superior PFS (50% vs 38% at
5 years; P ¼ .007) and OS (55% vs 42% at 5 years;
P ¼ .004) compared with WAR.2 This established chemotherapy as the standard of care for advanced stage disease
as well as disseminated recurrent disease. Phase II data
demonstrated that paclitaxel had significant single-agent
activity, with an RR of 36% in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer.3 This finding contributed to the development of Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 163,
which compared doxorubicin and paclitaxel versus doxorubicin plus cisplatin.4 This trial failed to demonstrate a
significant difference in RR, PFS, or OS between the
2 arms, and doxorubicin plus cisplatin remained the
standard of care. Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol
177 compared doxorubicin plus cisplatin versus doxorubicin plus cisplatin on Day 1 followed by paclitaxel on
Day 2; the latter was superior to doxorubicin plus cisplatin in terms of overall RR (57% vs 34%; P < .01) and median PFS (8.3 vs 5.3 months; P < .01), and for the first
time OS was superior, with a median of 15.3 (doxorubicin
plus cisplatin on Day 1 followed by paclitaxel on Day 2)
versus 12.3 months (doxorubicin plus cisplatin) (P ¼

5408

.037).5 With current, completed trials, the most efficacious regimen for primary treatment of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer is doxorubicin plus cisplatin on
Day 1 followed by paclitaxel on Day 2, with a complete
clinical RR of 22% and a median PFS of 8 months, as
reported from Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol
177. Clearly, the majority of patients with either advanced
or recurrent endometrial cancer will progress after firstline chemotherapy. Unfortunately, there are limited
options to treat persistent or recurrent disease after firstline chemotherapy, and no standard regimen has yet been
defined. In an effort to identify active agents in endometrial cancer, the Gynecologic Oncology Group has developed a phase 2 queue evaluating novel cytotoxic agents
(Gynecologic Oncology Group 129 series) for patients with
measurable, recurrent/persistent disease who have received
1 prior chemotherapy regimen. To date, there have been 9
published Gynecologic Oncology Group 129 series studies.
By using response as the primary endpoint, only paclitaxel
produced sufficient responses (>25%) to warrant further
evaluation in a phase 3 setting.6 Oxaliplatin and liposomal
doxorubicin produced modest activity at 13% and 9% RR,
respectively, but have not been further evaluated in this
disease.7,8 The Gynecologic Oncology Group series 229 is
also a phase 2 trial program, which evaluates biologic (noncytotoxic) agents in the second-line treatment of advanced/
recurrent endometrial cancer. Of the 6 studied agents, only
the study of thalidomide (229-B) has been published,
showing minimal activity, with 8% of patients remaining
progression-free at 6 months.9
In ovarian cancer treatment, the concept of the
platinum-free interval exists as a marker for prognosis
after recurrence.10,11 In recurrent ovarian cancer management, the platinum-free interval is used to distinguish
dichotomous groups of patients based on prognoses and
probability of response to salvage agents. Furthermore,
the length of the platinum-free interval is pivotal in the
structure and design of many collaborative group trials
in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Given the
limited options available to patients with persistent/progressive endometrial cancer after first-line therapy, this
study sought to evaluate whether there is an interval
similar to ovarian cancer to define chemosensitive or
resistant tumor in prediction of response to second-line
chemotherapy and OS from time of recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was a pooled data analysis of patients with
advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer treated on 1 of
5 Gynecologic Oncology Group randomized phase 3
chemotherapy trials: Gynecologic Oncology Group 107
compared doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) to doxorubicin plus
cisplatin (60 mg/m2 and 50 mg/m2); Gynecologic Oncology Group 122 Arm 2 used doxorubicin plus cisplatin
(60 mg/m2 and 50 mg/m2); Gynecologic Oncology
Group 139 compared standard timed doxorubicin plus
cisplatin (60 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2) to a circadian timed
administration of the same combination; Gynecologic
Oncology Group 163 compared doxorubicin plus
cisplatin (60 mg/m2 and 50 mg/m2) to doxorubicin and
paclitaxel (50m/m2 and 150 mg/m2, over 24 hours); and
Gynecologic Oncology Group 177 compared doxorubicin plus cisplatin (60 mg/m2 and 50 mg/m2) to doxorubicin plus cisplatin on Day 1 followed by paclitaxel on Day
2 (160 mg/m2, Day 2, 45 mg/m2 and 50 mg/m2, Day 1).
Results of each of these studies have been presented
elsewhere.1,2,4,5,12 Eligibility criteria were similar for each
study, with the exception of Gynecologic Oncology
Group 122, which permitted patients with <2 cm residual, stage III/IV disease. Otherwise, all patients were to
have measurable disease and could not have received prior
cytotoxic chemotherapy. Patients were required to have
stage III-IV or recurrent endometrial cancer and a poor
potential for cure from radiation therapy or surgery alone
or in combination. Tumor samples from all subjects
underwent histologic confirmation by the Pathology
Committee of the Gynecologic Oncology Group. All 5
studies required that patients be followed similarly with
serial examinations and imaging studies every 3 months
for 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter. The factors
associated with treatment response and clinical outcome
have been previously evaluated.13,14
All patients who participated in the above protocols except the WAR arm of Gynecologic Oncology
Group122 were reviewed. Patients who progressed after
primary chemotherapy (PCT) and subsequently received
second-line chemotherapy were identified and included
in this study. Those patients who received no additional
therapy at recurrence were excluded from this analysis. A
pre-evaluation found that this group of patients usually
had a very short survival after disease recurrence, and we
assume that they did not receive additional chemotherapy,
likely because of their poor performance status and prognosis at recurrence. Progression-free interval (PFI-1) was
Cancer

measured from the date of randomization of primary
treatment to the time of disease recurrence. Primary and
salvage treatment were classified into platinum-based and
nonplatinum chemotherapies.
A second dataset was also explored to evaluate the
impact of the interval after PCT on treatment outcome
after second-line chemotherapy. Data from the Gynecologic Oncology Group phase 2 cytotoxic series 129,
including Gynecologic Oncology Group 129 B, C, E H,
I, J, K, L, and M, were analyzed. Patients enrolled in
these studies were reviewed to determine whether the
treatment-free interval (TFI) can be used to predict tumor
response, PFS, and OS from time of second-line chemotherapy.6-8,15-20 Eligibility criteria were similar for all
Gynecologic Oncology Group 129 series studies. Patients
were required to have recurrent or persistent endometrial
carcinoma refractory to curative therapy with established
treatments. Histologic confirmation of the primary tumor
by the Pathology Committee of the Gynecologic Oncology Group was required. All patients had measurable
disease and had received 1 prior chemotherapeutic regimen. The evaluated agents included paclitaxel, pegylated
liposomal doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, oral etoposide, dactinomycin, pyrazoloacridine, topotecan, irofulven (MGI114), and flavopiridol. TFI was defined as the interval
from the end of PCT until disease recurrence. The data
from Gynecologic Oncology Group 129 was analyzed
based on TFI instead of PFI-1 because data were only
recorded for the date of completion of PCT without complete documentation of the starting date. However, both
PFI-1 and TFI have been used interchangeably in prediction of treatment outcome of second-line chemotherapy
in ovarian cancer.21 We further analyzed the data from
Gynecologic Oncology Group 129, because this protocol
had more detailed information on outcome collected,
allowing us to assess the association of TFI with the
immediate outcomes of RR, 6-month PFS (%), and PFS
after second-line chemotherapy, in addition to the OS.
Response rate included both complete and partial
response.
Survival by PFI-1 or TFI group was estimated using
Kaplan-Meier procedure,22 and Cox regression model
was used to assess the association of PFI-1 or TFI with survival adjusted for covariates.23 For analysis, PFI-1 was
categorized as >6 months versus 6 months, and TFI as
>3 months versus 3 months based on their midpoints.
The tumor response or PFS rate at 6 months by TFI
group from Gynecologic Oncology Group 129 was
compared using Pearson chi-square test.

RESULTS
Part 1
Part 1 of this analysis involved evaluable patients who participated in Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 107,
122, 139, 163, and 177. A total of 586 patients with
advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer who recurred or
progressed after PCT on 1 of these 5 protocols and received
second-line chemotherapy were included in this analysis.
Demographic and treatment characteristics at primary
treatment, as well as some clinical information at secondline treatment for this group, are outlined in Table 1. The
median age was 63 years. The majority of patients were
Caucasian. Sixty-four percent of patients received PCT for
recurrent disease, as opposed to adjuvant therapy for
advanced disease (36%); 51% of the cohort received prior
radiation therapy. The most common cytotoxic regimen
used was doxorubicin plus cisplatin (65%), and 24% had
received paclitaxel. These baseline characteristics at primary
treatment were evaluated in relation to survival after second-line chemotherapy. Race, performance status (PS),
stage, tumor grade, and prior radiotherapy (RT) at the time
of PCT that had been previously associated with treatment
response and PFS after PCT13,14 were also predictive of
survival after disease recurrence (Table 2).
The median time from primary treatment to disease
relapse (PFI-1) was 6.7 months. Thirty-one percent of
these recurrent patients received platinum-based chemotherapy for second-line treatment. When PFI-1 and type
of second-line therapy, along with race, PS, stage, grade,
and prior RT were included for analysis, PFI-1 became
the most significant factor predictive of survival after re-

currence; race, PS, stage, grade, and prior RT remained
significant. Compared with patients with a PFI-1 6
months, those with PFI-1 >6 months had a 30% reduction in the risk of death (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.84
[P < .0001]). There was no evidence that the type of
second-line therapy (platinum vs nonplatinum) was
associated with survival (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77-1.11
[P ¼ .392])(Table 3). Furthermore, when we restricted
the analysis to patients who had primary treatment with
platinum-based chemotherapy (n ¼ 483), the results were
essentially the same.
Figure 2 demonstrates the survival since disease recurrence by PFI-1 and the type of second-line treatment.
For patients with a PFI-1 >6 months, median OS was
approximately 10 months, and for those with PFI-1 6
months, median OS was 6 to 7 months regardless of type
of secondary therapy. Furthermore, we investigated
whether the prognostic value of PFI-1 was different
among patients who were initially treated for advanced
disease versus those who were treated because of disease
recurrence. This analysis acknowledges the different
inclusion criteria for those patients enrolled in Gynecologic Oncology Group 122 (residual disease <2 cm; no
recurrent patients). Of the 586 patients in this analysis,
212 (36%) received PCT for advanced disease, and 127
(60%) of 212 of these patients were enrolled in Gynecologic Oncology Group 122. When we evaluated the effect
of PFI-1 after PCT for advanced versus recurrent patients,
the results were very consistent with median OS for
advanced patients with PFI-1 >6 months of 10.9 months
versus 9.9 months for recurrent patients. Similarly,
advanced patients with PFI-1 6 months had a median
OS of 6.7 months versus 6.6 months for recurrent
patients. These results demonstrated that the association
of PFI-1 with OS after disease recurrence was consistent

evaluated against the TFI. There is no significant evidence
from these data that RR was associated with TFI (>3
months compared with 3 months, 9.6% vs 5.8%; P ¼
.235) nor was PFS rate at 6 months (20.6% vs.17.2; P ¼
.482) or median PFS (2.7 vs 2.1 months; P ¼ .120). However, OS was significantly associated with the TFI (median,
10.2 vs 7.4 months; P ¼ .014). This result was consistent
when adjusted for age, PS, and grade, with an HR of 0.75
(95% CI, 0.57-0.97; P ¼ .030) (Table 5). Figure 3 depicts
the survival curve from time of initiation of the 129 series,
stratified by TFI of >3 or 3 months, again demonstrating
the association between longer TFI and improved OS.

DISCUSSION
Cytotoxic chemotherapy is increasingly being incorporated into the management of advanced and recurrent
endometrial cancer. On the basis of several phase 3 trials
performed by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, combination regimens appear to confer superior outcomes as
compared with single-agent regimens. Recently, the use of

5412

ratio; CI, confidence interval.

doxorubicin plus cisplatin on Day 1 followed by paclitaxel
on Day 2 as compared with doxorubicin plus cisplatin has
demonstrated improved OS as well as RR, making it the
most active combination regimen tested to date.5 Despite
this, in patients with advanced and recurrent disease, the
complete RR ranging from 9% to 22%. Even in patients
with minimal residual disease, such as those treated on
Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 122 and 184,
the recurrence rate still approaches 50%.2,24 As a result, a
sizable population exists for whom active second-line
therapy is needed. How to best treat this population is
unclear.
Although a commonly used paradigm attempts to
treat these patients with sequential salvage chemotherapeutic agents in the manner of ovarian cancer, the lack of
active agents for endometrial cancer limits the efficacy of
this approach. Given the poor outcome for these patients,
this is a clear area of research emphasis on multiple fronts.
One approach would be to use the agents we already
know to be active (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel)
and attempt to discern which factors are predictive of
response at the time of re-treatment. Our study attempted

Cancer

December 1, 2010

Treatment-Free Interval in EC/Moore et al

to address this question by evaluating the prognostic value
of the PFI while adjusting for other known prognostic
factors. Our results based on the Gynecologic Oncology
Group 129 series (1 prior therapy) were generally consistent with those obtained from analysis of first-line studies
(Gynecologic Oncology Group 107, 122, 139, 163, and
177). In the analysis of PCT protocols, a PFI-1 >6
months was associated with a 30% reduction in the risk of
death after adjustment for age, race, performance status,
stage, grade, and prior radiation. These results were also
consistent whether the patient was treated for advanced
stage or recurrent disease. In the analysis of second-line
chemotherapy protocols (Gynecologic Oncology Group
129 series), a TFI >3 months was associated with a 25%
reduction in the risk of death when adjusted for the same
factors. The median PFI-1 of 6 months and TFI of
3 months overlap and are roughly the same time point, and
we can say that our data suggest that the disease-free interval
after primary therapy is predictive of prognosis after secondary chemotherapy for patients with advanced or recurrent
disease. Unfortunately, unlike ovarian cancer, this time
interval does not appear to aid in selection of secondary
chemotherapy for recurrence. This variable is more likely a
general prognostic factor, or may be indicative of pan-drug
resistance/sensitivity, but not related to the tumor response
to a specific drug for secondary chemotherapy.
A second approach is continued development of
active new drugs. Combining biologic agents or adding
them with active cytotoxic drugs may be a more successful
strategy than using single agents in this population. Early
reports from Gynecologic Oncology Group 229E that
evaluated the use of single-agent bevacizumab in this
population are promising, with a 6-month PFS of 39%.25
Bevacizumab was recently paired with the mammalian
target of rapamycin inhibitor temsirolimus in Gynecologic Oncology Group 0229G; analysis of this study is
currently underway, but may build on the successes of
single-agent bevacizumab.
A third approach is to consider alternative clinical trial
designs and study endpoints. Our study attempted to look at
whether the TFI was predictive of 6-month PFS after
second-line chemotherapy, and we were failed to identify a
significant difference (17% for TFI 3 months vs 21% for
TFI >3 months). Given an increased utilization of this endpoint in studies carried out in this population, further studies
should be still considered. Although 6-month PFS is a current statistical endpoint in the Gynecologic Oncology
Group 229 (biologic) series, it has not traditionally been
used as an endpoint for 129 (cytotoxic) series. Interestingly,

if one considers 6-month PFS as the endpoint of interest for
these studies with a cutoff of >20% warranting further evaluation, then the following agents would have been advanced:
paclitaxel (6-month PFS, 21%), Doxil (23%), topotecan
(25%), oxaliplatin (27%), and irofulven (28%).6-8,18,19 This
is compared with success based on RR, where only paclitaxel
was approved for further study. In patients with terminal
disease, deciding on an appropriate study outcome may
change how we interpret success in these protocols.
In summary, we performed an ancillary data analysis
on both primary and secondary treatment protocols for
advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer to determine
whether a time interval analogous to that used in ovarian
cancer existed with which we could triage patients into prognostic groups. We did find that such an interval is prognostic; however, the clinical utility of this variable in selecting
secondary treatment for recurrence is likely limited.
Attempting to apply an ovarian cancer treatment paradigm
to advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer is attractive, given
the progress we have achieved in treatment of ovarian cancer.
The barrier we face in translating ovarian cancer outcomes
to endometrial cancer is the absence of an agent with
extreme activity against endometrial cancer. With the introduction of platinum to the ovarian cancer treatment paradigm, RRs and PFS markedly improved.26 Although
platinum agents, taxanes, and anthracyclines all appear to
have activity, none to date have demonstrated the type of
activity required to drastically change the duration of first
PFS. In addition, the absence of additional active salvage
agents limits the application of sequential salvage chemotherapy in this population, even if we were to prolong first PFS.
