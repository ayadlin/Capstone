ABSTRACT
ALK is involved in the onset of several tumors. Crizotinib (XalkoriTM), a potent
ALK inhibitor, represents the current front-line treatment for ALK+ NSCLC and shows
great clinical efficacy. However, resistant disease often develops after initial response.
ASP3026 is a novel second-generation ALK inhibitor with activity on crizotinibresistant ALK-L1196M gatekeeper mutant. As resistance is likely to be a relevant
hurdle for any drug, we sought to determine the resistance profile of ASP3026 in the
context of NPM/ALK+ ALCL. We selected six ASP3026-resistant cell lines by culturing
human ALCL cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of drug. The established
resistant cell lines carry several point mutations in the ALK kinase domain (G1128S,
C1156F, I1171N/T, F1174I, N1178H, E1210K and C1156F/D1203N were the most
frequent) that are shown to confer resistance to ASP3026 in the Ba/F3 cell model.
All mutants were profiled for cross-resistance against a panel of clinically relevant
inhibitors including ceritinib, alectinib, crizotinib, AP26113 and PF-06463922. Finally,
a genetically heterogeneous ASP3026-resistant cell line was exposed to second-line
treatment simulations with all inhibitors. The population evolved according to relative
sensitivity of its mutant subclones to the various drugs. Compound PF-06463922 did
not allow the outgrowth of any resistant clone, at non-toxic doses.

no exception. ALK-related diseases comprise a diverse set
of malignancies, including subsets of non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL),
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma,
as well as breast, colon and thyroid cancers, and other rarer
diseases [5]. Aberrant ALK kinase activation is turned on
by either point mutation or gene fusion and inappropriate
ALK-driven signaling is known to cause malignant
transformation. Consequently, ALK-dependent tumors are
extremely sensitive to ALK inhibition: indeed, the recent
introduction of crizotinib has been a major breakthrough
in the management of ALK-positive cancer [6]. However,
following anti-ALK-specific therapy, relapses frequently
occur. Crizotinib-resistant disease is often associated with
ALK kinase mutations or amplification, that render the
enzyme refractory or less sensitive to the drug [7–11].

INTRODUCTION
Cancers are heterogeneous masses that evolve
following population dynamics [1]: descendants from the
founder cell expand according to their genotype and to the
environment, which provides selective pressure. Drugs used
to treat a tumor are part of its environment and represent a
strong selective agent. Notwithstanding enormous clinical
success of rationally targeted therapies, the emergence of
drug-resistant subclones is a direct consequence of cancer
heterogeneity and represents a formidable challenge toward
definitive cure. Examples of this phenomenon abound
in the literature, from initial pioneering observations in
imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL-positive leukemia [2] to more
recent cases in both hematological and solid tumors [3, 4].

Second generation ALK inhibitors (ALKi) have been
developed in order to overcome resistance to crizotinib
[5]. However, we can expect resistance to arise under any
treatment. In order to predict the possible evolution of
ALK+ ALCL under ALKi pressure, and to study crossresistance among the available drugs, we recently set up
an in vitro model of acquired resistance to selective ALK
inhibition in ALCL [12, 13]. As part of this effort, we
isolated six NPM/ALK+ cell lines that show high resistance
to the novel ALKi, ASP3026 (Astellas Pharma, Japan).
ASP3026 was disclosed for the first time in 2011 [14, 15].
Recently, additional preclinical and clinical data were
released [16–18]. The compound showed improved ALK
selectivity compared to crizotinib and was able to suppress
EML4/ALK-L1196M mutant xenografts in vivo, with no
apparent toxicity. In a phase 1 trial, ASP3026 achieved
44% partial responses and 50% stable disease in patients
who had progressed on crizotinib [18].
In this work, we describe ASP3026-resistant ALCL
cells carrying novel single as well as double ALK kinase
domain mutations. We further characterized the effects
of these mutations on ALKi sensitivity in a Ba/F3 cell
model and studied the evolution of a composite pool of
ASP3026-resistant cells under second-line treatment with
clinically relevant ALKi drugs [6, 19–22].

had on average a decreased anchorage-independent growth
potential compared to parental cells (Supplementary
Figure S2B). However, the number of colonies was either
unchanged or even increased by the presence of ASP3026
in the medium. In the case of SUPM2R1, colonies were
observed only in the presence of the drug, suggesting a
sort of drug-addiction. Sensitivity of the selected cells to
ASP3026 was then analyzed by cell proliferation using
dose-response curves. As shown in Figure 1A–1B and in
Table 1, the six resistant cell lines showed a 10- to 60fold shift in IC50, compared to their parental counterparts.
To verify that decreased sensitivity to the inhibitor was
indeed due to persistent N/A kinase activity, the cells were
challenged with increasing doses of ASP3026, and N/A
tyrosine phosphorylation (pALK) was measured, as an
indicator of enzyme activation (Figure 1C–1D). While
pALK signal was dramatically reduced by 30–100 nM
in parental cells, all resistant cell lines showed persistent
ALK phosphorylation at 300 nM and in some cases up
to 1000 nM. A parallel change in STAT3 phosphorylation
pattern indicates that downstream signaling is affected in
a similar manner, in resistant cells. These observations
suggest that the selected populations are able to maintain
an active N/A oncogenic signal in the presence of ASP3026
concentrations that normally cause complete suppression
of K299 and SUPM2 cells growth, and this translates
into the ability to proliferate normally. Interestingly, both
SUPM2 and K299 resistant cells showed an increased
basal pALK band compared to parental cells. This may
be achieved either by N/A overexpression or by increased
intrinsic activity of mutant N/A. As shown in Figure 1,
K299R cells showed a slight increase of total ALK
band intensity. Using a different anti-ALK antibody, we
confirmed that K299R cells express approximately 5 to
9-fold more ALK protein, as determined by densitometry
analysis, while SUPM2R cells showed only a modest
(2–4x) increase (Supplementary Figure S3). Real-time
quantitative PCR confirmed the data in SUPM2R cells,
but not in K299R cells, where N/A mRNA was only
slightly increased (2 to 4-fold) in two out of three cell lines
(Table 1). For a comparison, in other ALKi-resistant K299
cells carrying wild-type ALK sequence, we observed 16 to
25-fold increases in N/A mRNA expression and this was
a clear effect of oncogene amplification [13]. Therefore,
in this case, we cannot definitely ascribe resistance to
oncogene overexpression.

RESULTS
Selection of ASP3026-resistant cell lines
Two human NPM/ALK (N/A)-expressing ALCL
cell lines were employed for the selection of ALKiresistant clones: Karpas-299 (K299) and SUPM2.
Three independent populations were derived from each
parental line and cultured in the presence of ASP3026,
starting from concentrations near the observed cell
growth IC90 (for K299, 100 nM; for SUPM2, 200 nM;
see Figure 1). Cell viability and growth rate dropped
accordingly (Supplementary Figure S1). When the cell
populations appeared to regain a normal growth rate,
after approximately 2–3 weeks, the concentration of the
drug was increased. After sequential stepwise increases
(over a total period of two to three months), three K299
populations (K299R1, K299R2, K299R3) that grew at
0.5 μM ASP3026 (25-fold the IC50 of the original line)
were obtained; similarly, three SUPM2 cell lines growing
at 2 μM ASP3026 (50-fold the parental cells IC50) were
selected (SUPM2R1, SUPM2R2, SUPM2R3). K299 cells
could not survive ASP3026 concentrations higher than
0.5 μM. The established drug-resistant cell populations
were characterized in terms of cell proliferation/viability
compared to the original cell lines. While, as expected,
parental cells growth was completely suppressed by
ASP3026 over a time-course of 5 days, resistant cells were
not only unaffected but they grew even better in presence
of the inhibitor (Supplementary Figure S2A). Interestingly,
soft-agar colony assays suggested that resistant cell lines

Identification of NPM/ALK mutations associated
with resistance
Next, the entire kinase domain of N/A was sequenced
in K299, SUPM2 and their respective ASP3026-resistant
subpopulations, by standard Sanger method. As reported
in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S4, several mutations
were identified that may explain the observed biological
resistance to the treatment. Interestingly, K299R2 and
SUPM2R1 carry different changes at the same position

(WT) N/A sequence by site-directed mutagenesis and
expressed in Ba/F3 cells, an IL-3-dependent murine
cell line that acquires interleukin independence upon
oncogene expression [12]. The C1156Y and L1196M
mutants have already been extensively investigated [7, 10,
12, 23, 24] and were not analyzed further. All transfected
cells (hereafter referred to as BaF3-N/A) expressed the
transgene (Supplementary Figure S5A–S5B). Expression
of the correct mutation was verified by sequencing the N/A
transcript (Supplementary Figure S6). We then evaluated
the sensitivity of BaF3-N/A mutants to ASP3026, compared
to WT and to parental IL-3-dependent Ba/F3, both in cell
proliferation assays (Tables 2–4) and by pALK Western blot
(Figure 2A). To summarize cell growth data, the IC50 value
obtained for each cell line is reported in Table 2. Moreover,
we calculated for each mutant a relative resistance (RR)
index, as the IC50 fold increase compared to cells carrying
WT N/A (Table 3). This parameter gives an estimate of
the impact that a mutation has on enzyme sensitivity to
a drug [25]. The higher the number, the more a particular
mutant is resistant to treatment, relative to wild-type. All
mutants showed an increase of ASP3026 IC50 compared
to WT (RR = 2.4–40), thus supporting the hypothesis
that the identified mutations are able to confer resistance
to ASP3026 (Tables 2–3). These results were confirmed
by ALK phosphorylation data (Figure 2A). In general,

(Supplementary Table 1). In particular, N1178H and C1156Y
substitutions were present in 49% and 23% of the clones,
respectively, and were later validated by Sanger method
(Supplementary Figure S4). The well-known gatekeeper
L1196M mutant was also detected at low frequency
(6.8%) by deep sequencing. In order to verify that the
double mutation in SUPM2R2 indeed occurred in cis, and
to calculate the relative frequency of SUPM2R3 mutants,
clonal sequencing was carried out after subcloning of N/A
amplicons. SUPM2R2 double mutation was confirmed to
be on the same filament, in 25/25 (100%) clones, while
SUPM2R3 cells proved to be a mixture of at least 4 different
mutants, including a double mutation (C1156F/D1203N)
that was present in the same filament in 10/23 clones
(Table 1). SUPM2R3 were further analyzed by deep
sequencing, confirming these data (Supplementary table 2).
Interestingly, a small fraction of SUPM2R3 clones (4.9%)
carried the I1171S aminoacid change. Thus, in our set of
ASP3026-resistant cells, at least three different I1171
substitutions were selected.

there was some variability among the various mutants. In
particular, the double mutant C1156F/D1203N showed the
highest resistance index in both assays, while N1178H was
the least resistant, combining results from the two tests. We
could not establish an IL3-independent line expressing the
single D1203N mutation, in two separate attempts. This
may be due to low intrinsic activity of this N/A mutant.

From a therapeutic standpoint, there are two options
when we are confronted with drug resistance: either to
increase the dosage, or to change regimen. Dose increase
is achievable within the limits of unspecific toxicity. To
get an approximate view of this window, we calculated
the ratio between IC50 of parental Ba/F3 cells (which
should represent unwanted off-target effects) and IC50 of

C1156F/D1203N mutations showed resistance to all
drugs, although at varying degrees (Table 3). Interestingly,
crizotinib efficacy on several mutants was comparable
to WT cells, indicating that it was not greatly affected by
ASP3026-selected mutations: apparently, ASP3026 and
crizotinib have little overlap in their resistance profiles.
To confirm this finding, human cells that had been
previously selected by crizotinib [12] were cross-tested
with ASP3026. As expected, crizotinib-resistant cells
carrying a L1196Q substitution were highly sensitive
to ASP3026, while I1171N-mutated cells were resistant
(Supplementary Figure S7A–S7C). To give a more
translational view of these results, RR index data are
complemented by TI values: despite high RR values,
each mutant may be targeted by at least one drug at
concentrations that are still far from unspecific toxicity
(Table 4). For example, the double C1156F/D1203N
was sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of alectinib
and PF-06463922, far below the IC50 observed in Ba/F3
cells. In particular, the results obtained with PF-06463922
illustrate this point: because of the very large window of
Ba/F3 versus BaF-N/A-WT sensitivity (> 2500x) some
mutants that display high RR values (shift in sensitivity
compared to WT) also show a high TI, suggesting
that they may be treated with a tolerable compound
dose. Otherwise, TI values confirmed that F1174I and
N1178H are the weakest mutants, G1128S shows good
druggability with other compounds, while all others are
on average poorly druggable, although for each mutant
there is at least one inhibitor that has a large TI (Table 4).

BaF-N/A cells. We define this ratio as ‘therapeutic index’
(TI; Table 4), that is, how much more sensitive is a mutant
compared to non-target cells, as reported by Sakamoto et
al. [19]. In this case, the lower the index value, the more a
mutant resembles parental ALK-independent Ba/F3 cells,
indicating a poor therapeutic window. Two mutants, F1174I
and N1178H, showed a large TI (> 10) suggesting that such
mutants may be neutralized by a raise in ASP3026 dosage.
In fact, these two mutants also showed the smallest RR
index. All other mutants are indeed problematic, since their
sensitivity to ASP3026 is too close to that of parental Ba/F3
cells (i.e., they have a low TI).

Cross-resistance of NPM/ALK mutants against
a panel of ALK inhibitors
When planning a change of drug, one would ideally
want to know in advance the sensitivity of refractory
disease to the proposed second-line regimen. In order
to mimic such a situation, we tested the sensitivity of
all mutants to currently available ALK inhibitors. The
results are reported in Tables 2–4 (IC50, RR, TI values,
respectively) and in Figure 2B (pALK data) and suggest
that F1174I and N1178H are the most easily tractable
mutants, as they show sensitivity to most secondgeneration inhibitors. BaF-N/A cells carrying the
G1128S substitution displayed variable sensitivity to the
various drugs and should not represent a big challenge
in the future. Both C1156F and E1210K mutants were
sensitive to crizotinib, while I1171N and the double

Second-line treatments of ASP3026resistant cells

(Figure 4C–4D). Asp1203 lies at the bottom of the ATP
pocket, in close proximity to inhibitors, therefore it is
expected to hinder inhibitor binding [27, 28]. Moreover, it
is located within the hinge region, adjacent to two residues
associated with drug resistance (G1202 and S1206) and it
makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond with ADP [29],
suggesting that mutations in this position may also affect
enzyme kinetics. G1128S lies within the glycine-rich
nucleotide-binding region (P-Loop) and seemed to have an
effect on the flap of the glycine-rich loop that may result in
enhanced ATP binding. The other mutations are too far from
the inhibitor-binding site, outside the range of the docking
protocol (15 Å) and therefore they could not be used to
simulate ASP3026 docking. However, from the structural
information available, we hypothesized that they may have
an influence on the stability of the hydrophobic pocket of
the active site (I1171N/T) as well as on the kinetics of the
DFG motif and the activation loop (I1171N/T, F1174I and
N1178H) (see Figure 4B). In particular, I1171 seems to be a
crucial determinant of enzyme regulation: it is part of the αC
helix, which governs activation of protein kinases, and of
the hydrophobic spine, another key regulatory element [34].
As postulated in our previous molecular modelling analysis
[12], I1171N (and possibly any change at this position)
alters the stability of the hydrophobic spine and renders
the kinase intrinsically more active by stabilizing the active
conformation. We could not devise any explanation for the
C1156F mutant data. However, according to recent studies,
a change at C1156 may interfere allosterically with the
binding of inhibitors by causing conformational changes in
the inhibitor binding cavity and a consequent displacement
of the compounds [7, 24, 30].

As tumors develop drug-resistant clones, they
may face additional therapies and therefore evolve in
different directions according to the selective pressure
they undergo. We simulated second-line treatments of the
SUPM2R3 heterogeneous population with all other drugs.
The cells were treated for two weeks with concentrations
corresponding to 20% of the Ba/F3 parental cell line IC50,
which was taken as a reference for unspecific toxicity.
Interestingly, cells exposed to alectinib and AP26113
evolved a homogeneous clone carrying the E1210K
mutation in 100% of the cells (Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure S8), in line with proliferation data that indicate
high resistance to these inhibitors by N/A-E1210K. On
the other hand, a pure C1156F/D1203N double mutant
emerged under crizotinib and ceritinib, in agreement with
data showing that crizotinib can easily suppress E1210K
but not the double mutation. Finally, when challenged
with the corresponding dose of PF-06463922, no resistant
cells could be retrieved. When the selection was repeated
at half dose, again no outgrowth was observed. Thus,
PF-06463922 was the only inhibitor able to efficiently
overcome ASP3026 resistance in a highly heterogeneous
cell population, at tolerable concentrations.

Molecular modelling analysis
of NPM/ALK mutations
In order to rationalize the experimental data, with
particular reference to sensitivity/resistance to ASP3026,
we ran a molecular modelling analysis of N/A mutants.
Molecular docking simulations were carried out using
GOLD 5.2.2. Before running simulations with ASP3026,
the docking protocol was validated by assessing the
capability of GOLD to reproduce the crystallographic
structure of ceritinib, an analogous ALK inhibitor when
compared to ASP3026, in complex with the enzyme (PDB
ID: 4MKC) [26]. These preliminary results clearly showed
that the software was able to reproduce the crystallographic
complex with RMSD value of 0.8 Å (Supplementary
Figure S9A). This allowed us to further apply the docking
protocol towards the identification of the putative binding
mode of ASP3026 within the active site of ALK. The
binding of ASP3026 at the ALK active site showed that
ASP3026 and ceritinib share a highly similar interaction
network (Supplementary Figure S9B). According to the
binding mode identified for ASP3026, we hypothesized
that the mutations G1128S, E1210K and D1203N could be
relevant for the interactions-based recognition process and
in the stability of protein/inhibitor complex (Figure 4A). In
particular, docking of ASP3026 into E1210K or D1203N
ALK mutants showed a preferred solution that was different
from that in the WT, suggesting that these mutations may
cause an inhibitor shift, increasing the binding energy

DISCUSSION
The acquisition of resistance to kinase inhibitors
has emerged as a big hurdle in targeted anticancer therapy.
The knowledge of resistance profiles associated to each
available drug is of great importance in the management
of patients. Along these lines, we set out to identify the
mechanisms that may lead to ALK inhibitor resistance in
ALCL. Point mutations, ALK gene amplification, activation
of alternative signaling pathways, as well as yet unknown
mechanisms have been recognized thus far [7–11]. In this
study, we selected several ALCL cell lines that are able to
propagate in the presence of high doses of ASP3026. In all
derived cell lines, we identified at least one nonsynonimous
ALK kinase domain mutation that rendered the enzyme less
susceptible to inhibition, as demonstrated in transfected Ba/
F3 cells. SUPM2 resistant cells grew in the presence of
2 μM inhibitor, while it was not possible to reach the same
dose with the K299 line. This is reflected by higher RR
values displayed by SUPM2-derived mutants. As illustrated
by K299R3 and SUPM2R3 cells, it is possible that all
resistant cell populations accommodate multiple mutant
subclones at low frequency, that may expand under certain

circumstances, such as second-line ALKi therapies. It is
also likely that moderate N/A overexpression in K299 cells
synergizes with point mutations to achieve drug resistance.
In the analysis of BaF-N/A sensitivity to inhibitors,
we reported both the RR and TI values for each mutant,
along with the raw IC50 value. We believe that the two
data normalizations are complementary and are both
useful: RR index gives a mechanistic/molecular view of
the relative sensitivity of a mutant versus the wild-type
enzyme; on the other hand, TI values provide a view of
the therapeutic impact of a mutation, i.e. how much the
mutant becomes similar to non-responding ALK-negative
cells: this is related to unspecific toxicity of a drug. In
many cases, RR and TI give similar outputs. However,
it is possible that even a marked drop in sensitivity, e.g.
10-fold, does not translate in real clinical resistance, due
to large therapeutic windows (difference between specific
and unspecific activity). This concept is best recapitulated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by cross-resistance data with PF-06463922. Although
most mutants were attributed a RR > 10, due to very potent
activity against wild-type N/A, their sensitivity was still in
the low nanomolar range, easily achievable under standard
clinical regimens. Therefore, we should be cautious when
interpreting these data: although the compound indeed
suffers a shift in sensitivity caused by some mutations,
physicians may still be able to successfully treat a
patient carrying such mutations. Similarly, Friboulet
and colleagues reported significant loss of sensitivity to
ceritinib for L1196M (in H3122 cells) and C1156Y (BaF3EML4/ALK) mutants compared to wild-type in vitro, yet
the two mutations could be targeted in vivo, likely due
to higher potency of ceritinib compared to crizotinib, at
tolerable concentrations [26].
Molecular modelling analysis provided hints to the
possible mechanisms leading to the observed resistance
to ASP3026. Glycine 1128 is conserved in most kinases.

Indeed, the glycine-rich loop in the ATP-binding site is
one of the most highly conserved sequence motifs in
protein kinases. The same residue was found mutated in
neuroblastoma patients (G1128A) [31], where it is thought
to contribute to kinase hyper-activation by making the
P-Loop more rigid and thus facilitating ATP access to the
active site [28]. We observed a Gly to Ser substitution
(G1128S): according to Hemmer et al. both Gly-to-Ser
and Gly-to-Ala mutations in PKA P-loop greatly increased
ATP hydrolysis and phosphate transfer to a peptide
substrate [32]. Furthermore, G1128 corresponds to G254
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of ABL, which is flanked by two hotspots of imatinibresistant BCR/ABL mutations [33].
Cysteine 1156 has previously been implicated in
resistance to crizotinib, when mutated to Tyr (C1156Y)
[7]. Phenylalanine is a tyrosine lacking the hydroxyl
group. Therefore, they are structurally similar, but have
different polarity. ALK fusion proteins carrying the
crizotinib-resistant C1156Y mutation are reported to be
sensitive to AP26113 [34], alectinib [19], and (partially)
to ceritinib [26]. In our cells, C1156F alone was sufficient
to cause resistance to ASP3026, but surprisingly not to
5729

crizotinib, while resistance increased significantly when
combined in cis with D1203N mutation, which has been
observed in an in vitro resistance screening with crizotinib
and NVP-TAE684 [27]. Interestingly, C1156F also
affected inhibition by the other compounds, thus showing a
very different behavior compared to C1156Y [19, 23, 34].
How the simultaneous presence of C1156F and D1203N
mutations acts synergistically to induce resistance is at
present unclear. The clone harboring a single C1156F
substitution has likely arisen earlier (probably at lower
ASP3026 concentration) and has subsequently acquired
the second hit at D1203, since we observed rare C1156F
single mutants but never found D1203N alone, in our
clones. Indeed, the double C1156F/D1203N mutant shows
higher RR to ASP3026 compared to C1156F.
Ile1171 has been identified as a mutational hotspot
in various models of resistance to ALK inhibitors. We
previously described an I1171N change in crizotinib-resistant
cells in vitro [12] and in one relapsed ALCL patient [35].
This mutant proved resistant to NVP-TAE628, too. Recently,
I1171T/N/S mutations developed in three alectinib-resistant
NSCLC patients [36, 37]. The I1171T mutant was identified
in crizotinib-resistant cells [38] and xenografts [26] that
showed a shift in sensitivity to both crizotinib (4-fold) and
ceritinib (3-fold) in Ba/F3 cells, compared to wild-type.
However, regression of tumors harboring such mutation
were obtained in vivo by ceritinib. Recently, the I1171N
mutant was described as sensitive to ASP3026 in a 293T
cell model [17]. However, the authors could only obtain a
partial decrease in NPM/ALK phosphorylation at a high drug
concentration. Finally, both I1171T and I1171N mutants were
described in an in vitro mutagenesis screen with crizotinib
[39]. We found three different substitutions at I1171 among
ASP3026-resistant cells, again indicating that I1171 is a
critical residue controlling sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. The
three changes are not equivalent: threonine makes the residue
smaller, thus creating more space; on the other hand, serine
and asparagine are polar residues. According to our analysis,
I1171 mutations affect both the inhibitor binding site and the
enzyme kinetics. This is confirmed by the finding that I1171N
is both an activating mutation in neuroblastoma patients
[31] and a drug-resistant mutant in ALCL and NSCLC
patients [35–37].
Phenylalanine 1174 lies at the C-terminal end of the
αC helix. According to Bossi et al., it is the core residue of
a hydrophobic network that controls kinase activation [28].
Mutations at this position would facilitate the formation of
transient structures that promote the active conformation
of the kinase. Indeed, F1174L is a frequent mutation in
neuroblastoma [31, 40]. In addition, F1174L was identified
in a crizotinib-resistant IMT patient with RANBP2-ALK
translocation [9]. Biochemical analysis showed that F1174L
has a significantly higher catalytic efficiency and higher
affinity for ATP compared to wild-type enzyme, which
may explain why it is both an activating and a resistance
mutation [29, 41]. We observed a F1174I substitution, which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

conferred mild resistance to ASP3026 but not to crizotinib,
nor to other compounds. In fact, it only represented a minor
population within SUPM2R3 cells, that might have been
selected at lower doses and then overcome by other, more
resistant mutants at the final ASP3026 concentration. To
make a direct comparison between Leu and Ile substitutions,
we established a BaF-N/A-F1174L cell line and found
that it provides limited resistance to crizotinib (RR = 3),
suggesting that F1174 mutants in general may be easily
overcome by moderate drug dose increase (Supplementary
Figure S10). Furthermore, a F1174C change has been
observed in K299 cells resistant to alectinib [38], although
the mutation was not further validated by ectopic expression
in Ba/F3 cells. Yet another substitution, F1174V, was
recently isolated from a NSCLC patient who progressed on
crizotinib [42] and from our AP26113-resistant cells [13].
Early clinical data with ceritinib showed progression of
drug-resistant NSCLC disease via acquisition of F1174V or
F1174C mutations [26].
In our second-line therapy simulation, the novel
inhibitor PF-06463922 [22] showed superior therapeutic
value, due to a very large therapeutic window, which
allowed the use of a more efficacious concentration.
Inhibitor concentrations used for this analysis were
adjusted according to their effects on Ba/F3 cells: they
cause no toxicity to IL3-driven parental cells, while
inhibiting > 99% BaF-N/A-WT cells, and are close or
above the calculated IC50 for BaF-N/A-C1156F/D1203N
and BaF-N/A-E1210K mutants, which represented the
most frequent clones within SUPM2R3 population.
Indeed, SUPM2R3 cell pool evolved according to the
sensitivities predicted by BaF-N/A transfectants, except
for PF-06463922, which did not allow the outgrowth
of any clone. The sensitivity of E1210K and C1156F/
D1203N mutants to ceritinib or AP26113 is not very
different (Tables 3–4), yet the SUPM2R3 polyclonal
culture evolved in opposite directions under the two
drugs. Either this is a random effect of genetic drift, or
the small differences in RR observed are ultimately
sufficient to drive evolution in one direction or the other.
Furthermore, it should be noted that this second-line
selection was run under different conditions compared
to the initial ASP3026-driven selection, in that we used
relatively higher drug concentrations in a shorter period,
allowing for fast clonal evolution. For crizotinib, the
used dose corresponds to mean trough plasma concentra­
tion measured in patients [43, 44], while for ceritinib
and alectinib these values are reported to be higher
[20, 45], which may suggest that we underestimated their
therapeutic potential (Supplementary Table 3). However,
it is difficult to compare in vitro and in vivo effects of
drugs. For example, steady state plasma concentration
of alectinib at the recommended dose of 300 mg is about
1 μM [45], but this was clearly toxic to Ba/F3 cells in our
model, therefore it could not be taken as surrogate of a
‘safe’ treatment.

In conclusion, this work confirms that resistance
to ALK inhibition is a relatively common event.
However, the more compounds are available, the higher
the probability that at least one drug will be able to
overcome resistant disease. Interestingly, many of the
mutated residues identified here that conferred resistance
to ASP3026 (Cys1156, Ile1171, Phe1174, Asp1203,
Glu1210) have previously been linked to resistance to
other inhibitors, thus suggesting that the spectrum of
possible drug-refractory mutations in ALK kinase is
likely limited.

Western blotting

METHODS

The cells were typically treated for 4 hours with
vehicle or inhibitors and harvested. After wash with PBS, cell
pellets were lysed and loaded on SDS-PAGE as described
[12]. The following primary antibodies were used: antiphosphorylated (p-)ALK (Y1604), total ALK (clone 31F12)
and p-STAT3 (Y705) were from Cell Signaling Technologies;
anti-β-actin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; anti-STAT3
from Millipore; a second anti-ALK antibody (ALK-1) [47]
was kindly provided by Prof. Karen Pulford (University of
Oxford). Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies
were obtained from Bio-Rad and diluted 1:3000.

Cell lines and compounds
Karpas-299, SUP-M2 and Ba/F3 cell lines were
purchased from DSMZ, where they are routinely verified
using genotypic and phenotypic testing to confirm their
identity. The cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 plus
10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, in a humidified
chamber at 37°C, with 5% CO2. In addition, the medium
for Ba/F3 parental cells (transfected with empty pcDNA3
vector) was further supplemented with CHO cells
supernatant as a source of IL-3. Human drug-resistant cell
lines were maintained in the presence of the corresponding
compound at the highest concentration under which they
were selected. Fresh medium supplemented with drug was
provided every three days.
ASP3026 was kindly provided by Astellas Pharma
Inc.; crizotinib (PF-02341066) and PF-06463922 [22, 46]
were obtained from Pfizer Inc.; ceritinib (LDK378) [20]
was from Novartis AG; AP26113 [21, 34] was provided
by ARIAD Pharm.; alectinib (CH5424802) [19] was
purchased from Selleck Chem. All compounds were
dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM, aliquoted and stored at
−20°C until use.

Proliferation assay
The cells were seeded in round-bottom 96-well
plates (10,000/well) in the presence of serial dilutions of
compounds in DMSO (0.5% final DMSO concentration) and
incubated for 72 hours. During the last 8 hours of incubation,
the cells were pulsed with [Methyl-3H]-Thymidine and then
harvested onto glass fiber filtermats using a Tomtec Cell
Harvester. Filters were counted with a Wallac Microbeta
1405 Scintillation Beta Counter. Radioactivity associated
to each sample is proportional to the amount of labelled
thymidine incorporated into newly synthesized DNA, giving
a direct measure of the cell proliferation rate. All values
are normalized to vehicle-treated control which is set as
100% proliferation. The Inhibitory Concentration 50 (IC50)
value is defined as the inhibitor concentration that yields
50% proliferation, relative to control. IC90 represents the
concentration that causes 90% inhibition.

Site-directed mutagenesis and generation
of transfected cell lines
The pcDNA3.0 vector containing wild-type
NPM/ALK (pcDNA3-NA) was kindly provided by Dr.
S. W. Morris (St Jude Research Hospital, Memphis,
TN). Mutagenesis was run as described [12], using
oligonucleotides reported in Supplementary Table 4. Ba/
F3 cells were stably transfected with wild-type or mutated
pcDNA3-NA as previously described [12].

Soft-agar colony assay
One thousand cells were seeded in 6-well plates,
embedded in 0.3% low-melting agarose, with or without
inhibitor, on a 0.5% bottom agar layer, as previously
described [48].

PCR and DNA sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from 107 cells using
TRIzol® reagent, following manufacturer’s instructions,
and reverse transcribed using MultiScribe™ Reverse
Transcriptase (Life Technologies) and random hexamers.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was run as described
[12]. For mutation analyses, the NPM-ALK kinase domain

The model of ALK was constructed by removing
all water molecules and ligands from the X-ray structure
(PDBcode: 4MKC) and by adding the hydrogen atoms
using SYBYL-X 2.1.1 (Tripos Associates Inc, USA) [49].
The 3D models of ligands were built by using SYBYL-X
2.1.1. Docking simulations were carried out by means of
GOLD, version 5.2.2 (Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre, http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Solutions/GoldSuite/
pages/GoldSuite.aspx). GOLD adopts a search genetic
algorithm to generate lowest binding ligand-protein
complex energies. Genetic algorithm default parameters
were set: the population size was 100, the selection
pressure was 1.1, the number of operations was 105, the
number of islands was 5, the niche size was 2, migrate
was 10, mutate was 95, and crossover was 95. Docking
calculations were computed to obtain 100 randomly
seeded runs for each ligand. Binding-site cavity was set as
a spherical region of 15 Å radius centered on the phenolic
N atom of backbone of the M199 residue. To evaluate
the single poses resulted by search algorithm GoldScore
scoring function was used.
