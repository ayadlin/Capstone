Abstract
Aromatic amines (AAs) are chemicals of industrial, pharmacological and
environmental relevance. Certain AAs, such as 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), are human
carcinogens that require enzymatic metabolic activation to reactive chemicals to
form genotoxic DNA adducts. Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NAT) are xenobiotic
metabolizing enzymes (XME) that play a major role in this carcinogenic bioactivation
process. Isothiocyanates (ITCs), including benzyl-ITC (BITC) and phenethyl-ITC
(PEITC), are phytochemicals known to have chemopreventive activity against several
aromatic carcinogens. In particular, ITCs have been shown to modify the bioactivation
and subsequent mutagenicity of carcinogenic AA chemicals such as 4-ABP. However,
the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which these phytochemicals may
modulate AA carcinogens bioactivation and AA-DNA damage remains poorly
understood.
This manuscript provides evidence indicating that ITCs can decrease the
metabolic activation of carcinogenic AAs via the irreversible inhibition of NAT enzymes
and subsequent alteration of the acetylation of AAs. We demonstrate that BITC and
PEITC react with NAT1 and inhibit readily its acetyltransferase activity (ki = 200
M−1.s−1 and 66 M−1.s−1 for BITC and PEITC, respectively). Chemical labeling, docking
approaches and substrate protection assays indicated that inhibition of the acetylation
of AAs by NAT1 was due to the chemical modification of the enzyme active site
cysteine. Moreover, analyses of AAs acetylation and DNA adducts in cells showed that
BITC was able to modulate the endogenous acetylation and bioactivation of 4-ABP.
In conclusion, we show that direct inhibition of NAT enzymes may be an important
mechanism by which ITCs exert their chemopreventive activity towards AA chemicals.

Introduction

[2]. Many AAs, such as the tobacco smoke component
4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), are known human carcinogens.
Exposure to these aromatic chemicals is a causal factor in
a multi-step process leading to the development of tumors
[3, 4]. Like most chemical carcinogens, AAs require
metabolic activation by xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes
(XME) in order to exert their carcinogenicity, in particular
through reactive metabolites that interact covalently with

Aromatic amines (AAs) represent one of the most
important class of industrial and environmental chemicals
[1, 2]. AAs are used as raw materials or as intermediates
in the manufacturing of drugs or industrial chemicals such
as pesticides, dyes, polymers or rubbers. AAs are also
byproducts of gasoline combustion and pyrolysis reactions

DNA resulting in genotoxic adducts [1, 4]. Recent data also
suggest that other mechanisms, unrelated to DNA-adduct
formation, such as oxidative stress may also be of
importance for AA-dependent carcinogenesis [5].
In addition to cytochromes P450 (CYP450),
arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs), such as human
NAT1 and NAT2, are phase II XME that play a major
role in the detoxification and/or the bioactivation of AA
carcinogens [4, 6–8]. NATs are polymorphic XME and
several studies have revealed an association between NAT
activities and the risk of developing environmentallyrelated cancers [4, 6, 7]. Cellular metabolic activation
of procarcinogenic AAs relies on their N-hydroxylation
by CYP450 (such as CYP1A1, 1A2 or 2E1), and further
activation by NAT-catalyzed O-acetylation. This step
results in acetoxy ester metabolites that spontaneously
degrade to form arylnitrenium ions that can form bulky
adducts on DNA leading to the production of mutations
[1, 4]. It has been shown that 4-ABP DNA adducts
and mutation levels were significantly higher in cells
displaying elevated NAT1 activity which emphasizes the
relative importance of NAT1-catalyzed O-acetylation
of N-hydroxy-4-ABP in cancer risk [9]. Higher NAT2
catalytic activity was also found to be associated with
higher 4-ABP-mediated cytotoxicity and DNA adduct
formation [10].
The NAT-dependent bioactivation pathway of AAs
is in competition with the NAT-mediated N-acetylation
pathway which forms innocuous metabolites [4]. However,
it has been shown that N-acetylation of certain AAs,
such as benzidine, may nonetheless enhance metabolic
activation [11].
Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are phytochemicals with
potential cancer chemopreventive activity which are
found in cruciferous vegetables [12]. Several ITCs, such
as benzyl-ITC (BITC), phenethyl-ITC (PEITC) and
sulforaphane (SFN) have demonstrated cancer preventive
activity in animals and increased dietary intake of ITCs
have been shown to be associated with a reduced cancer
risk in humans [12, 13]. The electrophilic carbon residue
in the ITC moiety reacts with biological nucleophiles such
as cysteines in proteins or in glutathione. Modification of
proteins is recognized as a key mechanism underlying
the biological activity of ITCs [12–14]. The cancer
chemopreventive activity of ITCs is attributed, at least in
part, to their ability to alter the metabolic activation of
procarcinogens through inhibition of CYP450 enzymes
and nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2)-dependent
induction of phase II XME, such as glutathione
S-transferase (GST) enzymes [12–14].
ITCs have been shown to alter the metabolic
activation and subsequent mutagenicity and genotoxicity
of AA carcinogens such as 4-ABP [15, 16]. However,
the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which
these chemopreventive phytochemicals modulate AA

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

carcinogen bioactivation and DNA damage remains poorly
documented.
We report here molecular, kinetic and cellular
evidence showing that ITCs, such as BITC, can
modulate the bioactivation of carcinogenic AAs through
irreversible inhibition of NAT enzymes. Alteration of
the NAT-dependent metabolism of AAs by ITCs may
represent a novel biochemical mechanism by which
these phytochemicals exert their chemoprotective effects
towards AA carcinogens.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Phytochemical ITCs have been shown to exert
chemopreventive properties towards certain carcinogenic
AAs, such as 4-ABP [15, 16]. However, the molecular and
cellular bases of this chemoprevention remain limited.
Given the key role of NATs in the metabolic activation
of AA carcinogens, we hypothesized that these enzymes
could be targeted by chemopreventive ITCs such as BITC
or PEITC (Figure 1A). In addition, it has been shown that
increased activity of human NAT enzymes, in particular
NAT1, is associated with higher AA-DNA adducts and
mutagenesis which are relevant points for cancer risk
[9, 10]. To address whether human NAT1 is a target of
chemopreventive ITCs, purified recombinant enzyme
was exposed to different concentrations of two most
studied ITCs (BITC or PEITC) for a short period of time
(30 min) [12–14]. As shown in Figure 1B and 1C, these
two chemoprotective ITCs were found to inhibit the
N- and O-arylamine acetyltransferase activities of
NAT1 in a dose-dependent manner. Full inhibition of
NAT1 activities were obtained with BITC and PEITC
concentrations close to 30 µM. The IC50 values were
7 µM (± 2.5) and 15 µM (± 4.9) for BITC and PEITC,
respectively. In contrast, NMPEA, a structural analog
of PEITC without the ITC functionality, did not inhibit
NAT1 activities. Sulforaphane (SFN), a dietary-ITC with
an alkyl side chain was also found to inhibit NAT1 but at
concentrations close to 100 µM (data not shown). These
results are in agreement with previous studies on molecular
targets of phytochemical ITCs [17–19]. For instance, it has
been reported that the ITC functional group is essential
for the inhibition of the proteasome activity by ITC
phytochemicals, and that the side chains of ITCs dictates
the inhibitory potency [17–19]. Moreover, the structural
similarities of the arylalkyl side chains of BITC and PEITC
with arylamine substrates of NATs may also contribute
to the inhibitory potency of these ITCs towards NAT1
when compared to SFN. In addition to the experiments
carried out with NAT1, analyses conducted with purified
human NAT2 enzyme gave similar results with full
inhibition of the enzyme by BITC and PEITC obtained at
concentrations close to 25 µM (Supplementary Figure 1).
Our data thus indicate that the enzymatic acetylation of

AAs by NATs is readily inhibited in vitro by BITC and
PEITC.
Further molecular and kinetic analyses were
carried out with human NAT1 in order to characterize the
mechanisms underlying the inhibition of AA acetylation
by BITC and PEITC. ITCs as electrophiles can react
covalently with biological nucleophiles [19]. In particular,
the covalent binding of ITCs to cysteines in certain target
proteins (transcription factors, enzymes, cytokines, or
cytoskeletal proteins) has been shown to play a key role in
the biological effects of these phytochemicals [13, 17–19].
To test whether the inhibition of NAT1 by BITC and
PEITC occurs through irreversible covalent modification
of the enzyme, we first carried out dialysis experiments.
As shown in Figure 2A, dialysis did not allow significant
recovery of enzymatic activity of NAT1 previously
exposed to BITC or PEITC, thus supporting that NAT1
inhibition by the two ITCs proceeds through an irreversible
mechanism. Similar data were obtained with human NAT2
(Supplementary Figure 2A). To confirm that human NAT1
enzyme can be covalently modified by ITCs, we used
fluorescein-coupled ITC (FITC) as a probe. We found that
incubation of NAT1 with 30 µM FITC readily inhibited
NAT1 with concomitant formation of fluorescein adducts
on the protein (Figure 2B). No inhibition of NAT1 activity
nor fluorescent labeling of the enzyme were obtained
with fluorescein lacking the ITC moiety (data not shown).
These experiments support that the inhibition of NAT1
by ITCs, such as BITC, PEITC or FITC occurs through
irreversible covalent modification of the enzyme, which is
in agreement with studies carried out with other proteins/
enzymes targeted by ITCs [17–19]. Human NAT1 enzyme
possesses 5 cysteine residues, one of which being present
in the active site [20]. To investigate whether NAT1
cysteine residues are covalently modified, the enzyme
was first inhibited by BITC or PEITC prior to labeling
of free cysteine residues with fluorescein-conjugated

iodoacetamide as described previously [21]. As shown in
Figure 2C, incubation of the NAT1 with BITC and PEITC
resulted in its inhibition and the concomitant modification
of cysteine residues, as indicated by the disappearance of
the fluorescein-conjugated iodoacetamide labeling. Thus,
as observed for other proteins/enzymes targeted by ITCs,
NAT1 cysteine residues are chemically-modified by BITC
and PEITC [17–19]. Catalysis by NAT enzymes, including
human NAT1, relies on the presence of a cysteine residue
in the active site [20]. To test whether BITC and PEITC
react with this cysteine residue, protection experiments
in presence of AcCoA and CoA were carried out, as
described previously [22]. This approach takes advantage
of the catalytic mechanism of NAT enzymes which, in
presence of AcCoA (but not in presence of CoA), involves
the transient formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme
intermediate due to specific acetylation of the activesite cysteine [23, 24]. AcCoA protection experiments
have been used to show that inhibition of NAT activity
by chemicals is due (at least in part) to modification of
the active site cysteine [22, 25]. As shown in Figure 2D
and Figure 2E, incubation of NAT1 with BITC or PEITC
in the presence of AcCoA provided protection against
ITCs-dependent inhibition. In contrast, CoA, which
is unable to acetylate the active site cysteine of NAT1,
did not afford protection. Taken together, the results
presented above indicate that BITC and PEITC impair the
acetylation of AAs by NAT1 through irreversible chemical
modification of its active site cysteine. Similar data were
obtained with human NAT2 (Supplementary Figure 2B
and 2C). We further tested whether GSH and DTT, two
chemicals that can reduce cysteine residues and react with
ITCs, were able to reactivate BITC and PEITC-inhibited
NAT1. As shown in Figure 2F, we found that GSH or DTT
were unable to reactivate significantly inhibited NAT1,
thus further supporting the irreversible nature of the BITC
or PEITC reaction with the enzyme. Similar results were

obtained with human NAT2 (Supplementary Figure 2D).
GSH is a major cellular reducing agent which is known
to be involved in the metabolic disposal of BITC and
PEITC through uncatalyzed and catalyzed processes [26].
This occurs via reaction of the ITC moiety with
the thiol group of GSH leading to the formation of
GSH-dithiocarbamate conjugates [26]. We carried out
experiments where NAT1 was incubated with BITC or
PEITC in presence of an excess concentration of GSH
or DTT over BITC or PEITC (33 and 166-fold excess).
We found that these reducing agents only afforded partial
protection against BITC and PEITC-dependent inhibition
(close to 50% and 60% for 5 mM GSH and DTT,
respectively) (Figure 2G). These data suggest that BITC
or PEITC, even in the presence of high concentrations
of GSH [21, 25], are more prone to react with the active
site cysteine of NAT1 than with the thiol group of
GSH. Similar results were obtained with human NAT2
(Supplementary Figure 2E).

To further characterize the reaction of BITC and
PEITC with NAT1, kinetic analyses under pseudo-first
order conditions were carried out. The enzyme was found
to be inhibited in a time and dose-dependent manner by
BITC and PEITC as shown in the semilogarithmic plots
(Figure 3A and 3B). The plot of the apparent first-order
inhibition constants (kobs) against BITC and PEITC
concentrations fitted well to a line passing at the origin,
indicating that inhibition of NAT1 by these two ITCs
occurred through a single-step bimolecular process. The
second-order rate constants for inhibition of NAT1 by
BITC and PEITC were 210 and 66 M−1.s−1, respectively.
These results are in agreement with previous studies
indicating that BITC is more reactive than PEITC [17, 26].
In addition, the rate constants determined for the inhibition
of NAT1 by BITC and PEITC are more than 100 times
higher than those reported for the reaction of these ITCs
with the thiol group of GSH (2 M−1.s−1 and 0.6 M−1.s−1,
respectively) [26]. These differences may explain why

GSH, even at concentrations well above those of BITC
and PEITC did not provide full protection of the enzyme
activity against ITC-dependent inhibition (Figure 2G).
Analysis of the order of the reaction of BITC and PEITC
with NAT1 further suggested that the inhibition of the
enzyme occurred through a 1:1 stoichiometry which is
in agreement with the AcCoA protection experiments
reported above (Figure 2D and 2E). Altogether, our results
suggest that the BITC and PEITC-dependent impairment
of AAs acetylation occurs through the irreversible
inhibition of NAT enzymes by a mechanism involving the
chemical modification of the active site cysteine residue
by the ITC moiety of the two phytochemicals.
Docking approaches using the crystal structure of
human NAT1 were consistent with these data. As shown in
Figure 4, BITC and PEITC fitted well in the active site of
the enzyme with the ITC moiety covalently bound to the
catalytic cysteine and certain aromatic residues (Phe37,
Phe125 and Phe217) making hydrophobic interactions
with the aromatic ring of the arylalkyl side chains of BITC
and PEITC (Figure 4). Interestingly, these aromatic amino
acids are known to be involved in the binding of AcCoA
and AA substrates in NAT active sites [20, 27, 28].

Cellular studies have shown that NAT1 and NAT2
activities are required for metabolic activation of 4-ABP.
In particular, more 4-ABP DNA adducts, mutagenesis
and cytotoxicity were detected in cells displaying high
NAT1 and NAT2 activity [9, 10]. Therefore, in addition
to the molecular and kinetic studies reported above,
cellular approaches were carried out with BITC to
further characterize the effects of ITCs on the enzymatic
acetylation of AA carcinogens. To this end, the N- and
O-acetylation of 4-ABP were measured in MCF7 cells
exposed to BITC and 4-ABP (N-acetylation) or exposed
to BITC and N-OH-4-ABP (O-acetylation) as described
previously [5, 9]. The human breast cancer cell line
MCF7 is known to have functional NAT1 and has been
used previously to study the effects of ITCs on other XME
[29, 30]. In addition, exposure to the 4-ABP has been
associated to the etiology of breast cancer and 4-ABP-DNA
adducts have been found in human breast cancer cells
from smokers exposed to AA carcinogen [31]. As
shown in Figure 5, short exposure of cultured cells to
BITC significantly decreased the endogenous N- and
O-acetylation of 4-ABP.

Figure 4: Model of BITC and PEITC bound to the catalytic cysteine of human NAT1 enzyme. The binding modes of BITC
and PEITC to NAT1 was initially obtained by covalent docking. Best conformation was minimized using Amber force field [38]. The figure
was drawn by UCSF Chimera [39].

In parallel experiments, the levels of 4-ABP-DNA
adducts in cells exposed or not to BITC and to N-OH-4-ABP
were analyzed as described previously [32]. As expected
exposure of cells to N-OH-4-ABP led to the formation of
DNA adducts as reported previously [16] (Figure 5, Inset).
Conversely, 4-ABP-DNA adducts were not detected in
cells initially exposed to BITC which is consistent with
the inhibition of the endogenous O-acetylation of N-OH-4
-ABP by BITC (Figure 5, Inset). These results are in
agreement with previous reports showing that ITCs
inhibit the formation of 4-ABP-DNA adducts in bladder
cells and that these phytochemicals alter the metabolism
of AA carcinogens and their carcinogenicity [15, 16].
Interestingly, it has been suggested that inhibition
of hepatic NAT enzymes by cafestol and kahweol
(two diterpene phytochemicals) and subsequent decreased
bioactivation contribute to chemoprevention against
cancers associated with heterocyclic AAs [33]. Activation
of the Nrf2 signaling pathway by ITCs has been reported

to be involved in the inhibition of 4-ABP-caused DNA
damage, likely through the induction of GST that
detoxifies 4-ABP [16].
Our experiments were carried out with ITC
concentrations up to 40 μM. Several studies indicate that
micromolar levels of ITC may be achieved in vivo [14].
In addition, it has been shown that ITCs, such as BITC,
can accumulate in cells with intracellular concentrations
180 times higher than the initial extracellular ITC
concentration [26]".
In conclusion, our data support that inhibition of
NAT enzymes and subsequent alteration of the metabolic
activation of AAs could be another key molecular
mechanism by which ITCs, exert their chemoprotective
effects towards AA carcinogens. Our study may provide a
fondation for the development of NAT inhibitors and for
the design of mechanism-based studies for the discovery
of more efficacious ITC-related chemopreventive and
therapeutic agents.

determination of the endogenous N-acetylation activity of NAT1, MCF7 cells in culture dishes were first exposed to different concentrations
of BITC for 30 min at 37°C in serum-free medium. Cell monolayers were then washed with medium and grown in the presence of 4-ABP
(500 µM) for 4 h. N-acetyl-ABP was measured in cell culture medium by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC)
as previously reported [5]. For the determination of the endogenous O-acetylation activity, after exposure to BITC, cells were lysed and
100 µg of cell extracts were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mM AcCoA, 100 µM N-OH-4-ABP and 1 mg/ml deoxyguanosine (dG).

washed with medium and grown in the presence of N-OH-4-ABP (250 µM) for 4 h. Cellular DNA was extracted, quantified and spotted
on nitrocellulose membranes (500 ng/spot). 4-ABP-DNA adducts were detected using a monoclonal anti-4-ABP-DNA adduct antibody
(4C11, Pierce Antibodies) as reported previously [32].

Production and purification of recombinant
human NAT1
Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing a
pET28a-based plasmid were used to produce 6x-histidinetagged human NAT1. Briefly, transformed bacterial cells
were grown overnight at 16°C in the presence of 0.5 mM
of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis
buffer (20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme and protease inhibitors
(Sigma)). The lysate was subjected to sonication on ice and
pelleted (12,000g; 30min). The supernatant was incubated
with His-select nickel resin (Sigma) in the presence of 20
mM imidazole for 2 h at 4°C. Resin was poured into an
empty column (Bio-rad) and washed with washing buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 35 mM
imidazole). NAT1 was eluted in elution buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole).
After reduction with 10 mM DTT (15 min on ice), purified
NAT1 was applied to a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl. Protein concentration and purity were assessed by
Bradford reagent (Bio-rad) and by SDS-PAGE. Proteins
were kept at −80°C.
Purification of recombinant human NAT2 was
carried out as described previously [25].

Determination of the N-acetylation and
O-acetylation activity of NAT1
BITC (Sigma), PEITC (Sigma) and NMPEA
(Sigma) were diluted in DMSO at concentration of
100 mM. We tested the effect of ITCs on the activity
of recombinant human NAT1 by incubating purified
enzyme (1 μM final concentration) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) for 30 min at 37°C in absence or presence
of different concentrations of ITCs. N-acetylation
activity of purified human NAT1 in samples was
determined spectrophotometrically in 96-wells plates
using p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA) as acetyl donor and
p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) as the arylamine substrate
as previously described [6]. Briefly, ITC-treated or
untreated samples were assayed in PBS containing PABA
(500 µM final). Reactions (100 ml total volume) were
started by addition of PNPA (200 µM final). The activity

Effects of dialysis or reducing agents on ITCinhibited NAT1

was determined at 37°C by monitoring for 15 min the
increase in absorbance at 405 nm due to formation of
p-nitrophenol using a microplate reader (BioTek).
N-acetylation activity of NAT2 enzyme was carried
out with 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) as arylamine substrate.
O-acetylation activity of purified human NAT1 in
samples was determined by reverse-phase HPLC using
acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) acetyl donor, N-OH-4-ABP
as the N-hydroxylated arylamine substrate and
deoxyguanosine [9]. Briefly, ITC-treated or untreated
samples were assayed in PBS containing 100 µM N-OH4-ABP, 1 mM AcCoA and 1 mg/ml deoxyguanosine
at 37°C for 15 min. Reactions were stopped with the
addition of 100 µL of water saturated ethyl acetate and
centrifugated at 13, 000 g for 10 min. The organic phase
was removed, evaporated to dryness and the residual was
dissolved in 100 µL of 10% acetonitrile prior to HPLC
quantification of deoxyguanosine-C8-ABP adducts as
described previously [9].
All assays were performed in triplicate.

NAT1 (1 µM) were first incubated in PBS with
30 µM BITC or 30 µM PEITC for 30 min at 37°C.
Samples were either dialysed overnight at 4°C against
PBS or incubated 30 min with reducing agents (5 mM
DTT or 5 mM GSH) at 37°C prior to residual NAT activity
measurement using the PNPA assay. Experiments with
NAT2 were carried out in similar manner excepted that
2-AF was used as arylamine substrate.

Protection of NAT1 from ITC-dependent
inhibition by reducing agents
NAT1 (1 µM) was incubated in PBS with 30 µM
BITC or 30 µM PEITC in the presence of DTT or GSH
(up to 5 mM) for 30 min at 37°C. Residual NAT activity
was measured using the PNPA assay. Experiments with
NAT2 were carried out in similar manner excepted that
2-AF was used as arylamine substrate.

Effects of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) on

Effects of AcCoA and CoA on ITCs-dependent
inhibition of NAT1

NAT1 (1 µM) was incubated with or without 30 µM
FITC in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. Residual NAT1 activity
was measured using the PNPA assay as described above.
Aliquots (corresponding to 1 mg NAT1) were also spotted
on nitrocellulose membranes using a dot-blot apparatus
(Bio-rad). To remove free FITC, membrane was washed
with PBS and saturated 2 hours with PBS 5% milk. FITC
adducts on spotted NAT1 were detected by fluorescence
(Excitation: 494 nm, Emission: 512 nm) with a LAS-4000
apparatus (Fujifilm).

NAT1 (1 µM) was incubated in PBS with 30 µM
BITC or 30 µM PEITC in the presence of 150 µM CoA
or AcCoA for 30 min at 37°C. Residual NAT activity was
measured using the PNPA assay. Experiments with NAT2
were carried out in similar manner excepted that 2-AF was
used as arylamine substrate.

Kinetic analysis of ITCs-dependent NAT1
inhibition

Fluorescein-conjugated iodoacetamide labeling
of NAT1 cysteines

To determine the second-order rate inhibition
constant of NAT1 by BITC and PEITC, the enzyme
was preincubated with different concentrations of
BITC and PEITC under pseudo first-order conditions.
Briefly, NAT1 (1 µM final) was incubated with ITCs
in PBS at 37°C. At different time intervals, aliquots
were removed, diluted 10 times with PBS and assayed
for residual NAT1 activity using the PNPA assay.
The equation for the rate of inhibition of NAT1 by
each ITC (BITC and PEITC) can be represented
as −d [NAT1]/dt = ki.[NAT1]. [ITC] where [NAT1] is
the concentration of enzyme and ki the second-order
inhibition rate constant. Provided that each ITC is present
in substantial excess (pseudo-first order conditions), the
apparent first order inhibition rate constants (kobs = ki ×
[ITC]) can be calculated for each ITC concentration

NAT1 (1 µM) was incubated with 10 µM BITC or
10 µM PEITC in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. The reactions
were quenched with DTT (5 µM) and further incubated
with fluorescein-conjugated iodoacetamide (20 µM) for
10 min at 37°C (in the dark). Aliquots (corresponding
to 1 mg NAT1) were also spotted on nitrocellulose
membranes using a dot-blot apparatus (Bio-rad). Covalent
modification of NAT1 cysteines by fluorescein-conjugated
iodoacetamide were assessed by fluorescence (Excitation:
494 nm, Emission: 512 nm) with a LAS-4000 apparatus
(Fujifilm). The membranes were further used for the
immuno-detection of NAT1 using polyclonal anti-NAT1
antibody (166–180, Sigma).

Determination of 4-ABP-DNA adducts

from the slope of the natural log (ln) of percent
residual activity plotted against time. The second-order
rate constant (ki) was determined from the slope of kobs
plotted against ITC concentrations. Determination of the
reaction order of the reaction of NAT1 enzyme with the
BITC and PEITC was carried out by replotting the ln of
kobs versus the ln of ITC concentrations. Kinetic data were
plotted and fitted using Qtiplot software (http://www.
qtiplot.com/).

We used an immunodot blot assay to assess the
formation of 4-ABP adducts on cellular DNA from MCF7
cells. Briefly, MCF7 cell monolayers in six well plate
(2 × 106 cells per well) were first exposed to BITC in
free-serum DMEM for 30 min at 37°C. After a wash with
DMEM, cells were grown in DMEM containing 250 µM
N-OH-4-ABP for 4 h. Cellular DNA was extracted using a
Trizol kit (Euromedex) and quantitated with a NanoDrop
2000 apparatus. Heat-denaturated DNA (500 mg) was dot
blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Protran
0.2 NC) using the dot blot apparatus (Bio-rad). 4-ABPDNA adducts on spotted DNA samples were detected using
a monoclonal anti-4-ABP-DNA adduct antibody (4C11,
Pierce Antibodies) as reported previously [32].

Docking of BITC and PEITC in NAT1 active site
The binding modes of BITC and PEITC to NAT1
was initially obtained by covalent docking. The covalent
bond between sulfur atom in the catalytic cysteine and the
carbon atom in the thiocarbonyl group of BITC or PEITC
was fixed by a strong gaussian potential with a weight of
-100, and the width in gaussian function was set to 2.5,
The conformation BITC or PEITC was searched by smina
docking program [36, 37], with a customized score, which
is contributed by Van der Waals interaction, hydrogen
bond and a repulsion term for clashing. The top one
conformation was then minimized by Ambertools [38].
The modified cysteine was assigned with GAFF force
field and Amber99SB force field. The figure was drawn
by UCSF Chimera [39].

Statistical analysis

Determination of the NAT1 N- and
O-acetyltransferase activities in MCF7 cells and
exposure to BITC and AAs
MCF7 cells were grown in DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1 mM L-glutamine. MCF7 cells in
six-well plates (2 × 106 cells per well) were exposed to
different concentrations of BITC for 30 min at 37°C in
serum-free DMEM.
For the determination of the endogenous
N-acetylation activity, cells exposed or not to BITC were
washed with DMEM and grown in DMEM containing
500 µM 4-ABP. At different time points (2, 3, 4 h), 100 µL
of medium were taken and mixed with 100 µL of HClO4.
Mixtures were centrifuged 5 min at 10,000 g and the amount
of acetylated-4-ABP was quantitated by reverse phase
HPLC using a C18 column as previously described [5, 25].
For the determination of the endogenous
O-acetylation activity, cell monolayers exposed to BITC
were lysed (PBS containing 0.2 % Triton X-100 and
protease inhibitors) and centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 g.
100 µg of total cell extracts were incubated with 100 µL
PBS containing 100 µM N-OH-4-ABP, 1 mM AcCoA and
1 mg/ml deoxyguanosine at 37°c for 15 min. Formation of
deoxyguanosine-C8-ABP adducts was measured by HPLC
as described above.
