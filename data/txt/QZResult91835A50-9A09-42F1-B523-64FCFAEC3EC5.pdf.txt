BACKGROUND. A previously published prospective randomized phase 3 trial
showed that administration of 24 weeks of primary systemic chemotherapy (PST)
with paclitaxel and FEC75 (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) concurrently with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer
resulted in a 60% pathologic complete response rate (PCR) with no associated
severe cardiac toxicity. The purpose of this study was to review the efficacy and
safety of a similar regimen outside the setting of a clinical trial.

METHODS. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (defined as either immunohistochemical 31 or fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive) that had received
24 weeks of neoadjuvant trastuzumab concurrently with taxane and anthracy-

he evolution of the multidisciplinary management approach
combined with the administration of polychemotherapy, incorporating anthracyclines and taxanes, has resulted in significant
reductions in the risk of death with subsequent improvements in 5year survival rates for patients with early and advanced stage breast
cancers.1,2 The introduction of trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the HER2
receptor3 has resulted in further improvements in survival of
patients whose tumors overexpress HER2 in both the metastatic3
and adjuvant setting.4–7 Cardiac toxicity is the main side effect of

1 year either after chemotherapy or starting with the
taxane phase of a sequential chemotherapy regimen.4,5
Administering primary systemic chemotherapy
(PST) has several advantages including downstaging
the primary tumor and thus allowing higher rates of
breast-conserving surgeries, as well as providing an
in vivo assessment of tumor chemosensitivity. In
addition, PST allows for determination of the pathologic complete response (PCR), considered a surrogate marker for long-term disease-free survival.8
Keeping these factors in mind, and the finding that
the combination of trastuzumab with an anthracycline has significant activity, we recently published
the results of a phase 3 study9,10 where patients with
early-stage operable breast cancer received PST with
4 cycles of continuous infusion paclitaxel followed by
4 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC) concomitantly with weekly trastuzumab.
Epirubicin in this trial was given at a reduced dose
of 75 mg/m2. With this regimen we achieved a 60%
PCR rate with only 10% of patients developing grade
1 and 2 cardiac toxicity and only 1 patient developing symptomatic heart failure.
Patients who receive PST but do not attain a
PCR have various prognoses depending on the extent
of the response to chemotherapy. We recently developed a method of dividing such patients into separate prognostic groups based on the Residual Cancer
Burden (RCB).11 This index, using pathologic measurements of residual primary tumor and nodal metastases, essentially divides patients into 4 prognostic
groups: RCB 0 where a PCR is attained, RCB I with
minimal residual disease and considered low risk for
recurrence, RCB II with intermediate residual disease
and considered intermediate risk for recurrence, and
RCB III considered to be chemoresistant and at high
risk for recurrence. The purpose of this study was to
assess the efficacy, in terms of the PCR rate and RCB
category, and safety of a preoperative trastuzumab/
anthracycline chemotherapy regimen given outside
the controlled environment of a clinical trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Our breast cancer database was searched to identify
patients who had histologically confirmed, HER2positive (defined as either immunohistochemical 31
or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]-positive),
nonmetastatic invasive tumor who had received PST,
with the regimen described below, concomitantly
with trastuzumab. Patient clinical information, tumor
characteristics, response rates, and cardiac toxicity

information were recorded. The Institutional Review
Board approved this retrospective review.

Treatment
Paclitaxel was administered weekly at a dose of
80 mg/m2/week for a total of 12 weeks. This was followed by 4 cycles FEC75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2
intravenously, epirubicin 75 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, given on the first day of each
cycle) administered every 3 weeks. Trastuzumab was
administered as a loading dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously over 90 minutes on the first day and then
subsequently given weekly at a dose of 2 mg/kg over
30 minutes for a total of 24 weeks, concomitantly
with the above chemotherapy. After completion of
PST, patients underwent adequate surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) followed by radiation therapy and appropriate endocrine therapy if required.
In cases where trastuzumab was continued after surgery it was administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for an additional 6 months.
Pathologic Analysis
PCR was defined as no evidence of invasive residual
disease in the breast and axilla. A dedicated breast
cancer pathologist evaluated all available specimens
to record the variables necessary to calculate RCB.
Variables included: 1) primary tumor bed area; 2)
overall cancer cellularity as a percentage of the primary tumor bed area; 3) percentage of in situ disease; 4) number of lymph nodes involved with
disease; and 5) diameter of largest metastases within
the involved lymph node. These variables were then
entered into the RCB calculator, available on the M.
D. Anderson website (http://www.mdanderson.org/
breastcancer_RCB), which then classified patients
into 4 categories: RCB class 0, RCB class I, RCB class
II, or RCB class III.
Cardiac Toxicity
When available, information on ejection fraction preand postchemotherapy was recorded. Severe cardiac
events were defined as a symptomatic drop in ejection fraction of any percentage or congestive heart
failure.
Statistical Analysis
Recurrence was defined as any recurrence of disease
in either locoregional or distant sites. Recurrencefree survival (RFS) was defined as the time from diagnosis to the time of first recurrence or last followup. Percentages of PCR and RCB were reported with
their exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

RESULTS
Between January 2004 and June 2006, 40 patients were
treated with the regimen described above. This number excludes patients treated on the clinical trial.9,10
Patient pretreatment characteristics are listed in Table
1. The median age was 48 years (range, 29–81). All but
2 patients had FISH testing to confirm HER2 positivity.
Fifty-two percent of patients had estrogen receptorpositive disease. Thirty-eight patients had invasive
ductal carcinoma and 2 patients had invasive lobular
disease. The mean breast tumor size was 4 cm. More
than half (60%) had stage III disease, with 4 patients
presenting with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC).
Postchemotherapy 31 (77.5%) patients underwent
mastectomies, whereas 9 (22.5%) patients had segmental mastectomies. Sentinel lymph node biopsy
was performed in 8 (20%) patients and axillary lymph
node dissection in 32 (80%) patients. An average of 15
lymph nodes was dissected in patients who underwent
an axillary lymph node dissection.

Response

tients (55%, 95% CI, 38.5%–70.7%) achieved a PCR
(Fig. 1). A partial response was observed in 18
patients (45%, 95% CI, 29.3%–61.5%). Of the 18
patients who had a partial response, 2 patients had
no residual disease in the breast and 5 had isolated
tumor cells in either the breast or the lymph nodes.
Specimens to calculate RCB were available for 38
patients (95%) (Fig. 2). Twenty-two patients (57.9%,
95% CI, 40.8%–73.7%) were categorized as RCB class
0, 4 patients (10.5%, 95% CI, 2.9%–24.8%) as RCB
class I, 11 patients (28.9%, 95% CI, 15.4%–45.9%) as
RCB class II, and 1 patient (2.6%, 95% CI, 0.7%–
13.8%) as RCB class III.

Recurrence
At a median follow-up 19 months (range, 7–31
months) 5 (12%) patients have recurred. The median
RFS has not yet been attained. Four of the patients
who recurred did not achieve a PCR, 1 had primary
inflammatory breast cancer, and 1 has died. Brain
was the first site of metastases in 4 patients, whereas
liver/bone was the first site in 1 patient. At 2 years
the RFS was 74.5% (95% CI, 55.2%–100%).

Safety and Tolerance
Thirty-nine (97.5%) patients completed 24 weeks of
chemotherapy with concomitant trastuzumab, with 1
patient abandoning treatment because of poor tolerance to FEC. One patient developed febrile neutropenia during FEC administration requiring prophylactic
G-CSF with no dose modification necessary.
During this review it was noted that several
patients had cardiac evaluation performed outside
the institution with ejection fraction values pre- and
postchemotherapy with trastuzumab available in
only 21 patients. Five patients had an asymptomatic
drop of ejection fraction of greater than 10%, which
on follow-up reverted to pretreatment values. No
patient experienced symptomatic congestive heart
failure. At the time of this analysis 21 patients continued to receive trastuzumab postsurgery, with 50%
completing 1 year of therapy. No adverse symptomatic cardiac events have been observed thus far.

DISCUSSION
The objective of this retrospective analysis was to
determine the efficacy and safety of adding trastuzumab to sequential PST composed of paclitaxel and
FEC75 to patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer
outside the setting of a clinical trial. In this study we
attained a PCR rate of 55%, similar to the PCR rate
(60%) achieved in our earlier phase 3 randomized
study.9
Previous studies incorporating trastuzumab into
primary systemic chemotherapeutic regimens have
achieved PCR rates ranging from 12% to 23%.12–14
The higher rate observed in our study may be
explained by the longer (24 weeks) duration of preoperative trastuzumab administered, sequential use of
PST, and the combination of trastuzumab with the
anthracycline-based regimen FEC75. When the results

of our earlier phase 39,10 study were pooled with this
retrospective study, a total of 85 patients who received neoadjuvant trastuzumab concomitant with
paclitaxel and FEC75 were obtained, of which more
than half (52 patients) achieved PCR (61.1%, 95% CI,
40.0%–71.6%). In addition, high PCR rates were
observed regardless of stage of disease.
In our earlier study9 paclitaxel was administered
every 3 weeks as a continuous infusion. Greene
et al.15 compared weekly paclitaxel to a 3-weekly regimen for a total of 12 weeks followed by 4 cycles of
FAC (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide).
Higher PCR rates were observed with the weekly
paclitaxel schedule (28% vs 16%; P 5 .02). Despite
the finding that all the patients in this study received
weekly paclitaxel, PCR rates did not increase further
than that observed in our earlier study,9,10 which
may be explained by the finding that a larger proportion of patients in this study had more advanced disease than in our earlier study.9,10 This suggests that
the duration of therapy, the use of an anthracycline,
method of paclitaxel administration, and, most important, the use of trastuzumab are the determining
factors for PCR.
PCR is considered an important endpoint in
trials assessing efficacy of primary systemic regimens, as it has been shown in several studies to correlate with improved long-term outcomes.8,16 Kuerer
et al.8 showed that in patients with locally advanced
breast cancer PCR predicted for improved 5-year
overall and disease-free survival rates (89% and 87%,
respectively) compared with patients who did not
achieve a PCR (64% and 58%, respectively). In the
study by Hurley et al.,12 48 patients with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer or IBC received
PST with 12 weeks of docetaxel, cisplatin, and trastuzumab followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. They
attained a PCR rate of 17%, not very different from
an earlier study that used the same regimen without
trastuzumab (20%).17 However, they observed that
the addition of trastuzumab substantially improved
4-year progression-free (81% vs 65%) and overall survival (86% vs 73%), which agrees with the impressive
survival benefit seen with the addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy.4–7 The high PCR
(55%) rate seen in our study occurred despite the
finding that more than half (57%) the patients had
stage III disease, and 4 had IBC, which may, on further follow-up, translate to even better survival rates
than those observed so far in this group of patients.
In our previously mentioned clinical trial, only 26%
had stage III breast cancer; because the PCR rate has
been reported to be inversely related to initial tumor

size, the high PCR rate in this more recent series is
somewhat unexpected, and might be associated with
the use of weekly paclitaxel in this series.
Several studies8,18 have also shown an inverse
relation between long-term outcomes of patients
who receive PST that do not achieve a PCR and the
amount of residual disease left behind, essentially
dividing them into different prognostic groups. To
better define these groups, Symmans et al.11 reviewed
postoperative pathology specimens of 432 patients
that had received PST chemotherapy with either FAC
alone or paclitaxel and FAC. Variables including size
and cellularity of breast residual tumor and number
and size of residual nodal metastases were used to
calculate RCB that classified patients into 4 classes
(0-III) ranging from no evidence of disease to presence of bulky disease. RCB was found to be a better
predictor of identifying high-risk patients than standard AJCC (6th ed.) clinical staging with class III representing high-risk chemoresistant patients. In our
study the majority of patients who did not achieve a
PCR were classified as RCB class II and I with only 1
patient classified as RCB class III, reflecting the efficacious nature of the regimen used.
Through the use of gene expression profiling with
Affymetrix U133A gene chips, performed on 21 samples obtained in our earlier phase 3 randomized study,
we showed that clinical variables that have traditionally been used to predict PCR such as estrogen receptor status, grade, tumor size, and nodal status lost
their predictive value when trastuzumab was added to
primary systemic chemotherapy.19 This concurs with
our results, as we achieved similar PCR rates in both
estrogen receptor-positive and -negative patients.
Although serial cardiac evaluation information
was not available for all patients in this retrospective
study, the low incidence of symptomatic cardiac
events is similar to that observed in our previous
randomized trial.8 Encouraged by the safety observed
in our earlier study,8 21 patients went on to receive
adjuvant trastuzumab with no symptomatic cardiac
events reported so far. The recent adjuvant trials
have raised the question about the optimal duration
of trastuzumab, with 3 trials4–6 using 1 year of trastuzumab and 1 trial7 administering only 9 weeks of
trastuzumab. A fourth pilot study from the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)20 that randomized patients to either a short course (10 weeks) of
trastuzumab versus a long course (52 weeks) of trastuzumab did not show any difference in disease-free
or overall survival at a median follow-up of 64
months. Randomized trials with sufficient power are
needed to evaluate whether a shorter, less cardiotoxic
course of trastuzumab will be as efficacious.

1199

In conclusion, the administration of PST with
paclitaxel and FEC chemotherapy concurrently with
trastuzumab in our cohort produced high PCR rates
with no observed symptomatic cardiac events. The
majority of patients who did not achieve a PCR had
minimal to moderate amounts of residual disease.
Although this regimen requires evaluation in a large
prospective randomized trial to further define cardiac
safety, it may be considered in individual patients
with locally advanced or IBC to improve the chances
of achieving a PCR and long-term outcomes.
