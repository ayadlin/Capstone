BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined how patients understand and use genomic test results when deciding
about treatment. This study examined how women receive and incorporate results of Oncotype DX, a genomic test
that offers recurrence risk estimates, into decisions about adjuvant treatment for early stage breast cancer. METHODS: Participants in the cross-sectional study were 77 women with early stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast
cancer with 0 to 3 positive lymph nodes who received Oncotype DX between 2004 and 2009. Mailed surveys, supplemented by medical chart review, assessed how women received and understood recurrence risk information
based on the test. RESULTS: The most common test results were low (50%, 34 of 68) or intermediate (37%, 25 of 68)
breast cancer recurrence risk. Most women accurately recalled their recurrence risk based on the test (71%) and felt
they understood much of what they were told about it (67%). Approximately 25% of women recalled experiencing
test-related distress. Women’s perceived recurrence risk was associated with their actual genomic-based recurrence
risks, having had a previous cancer diagnosis, and worry about recurrence. Women with high recurrence risk typically
had chemotherapy (78%, 7 of 9), whereas only 2 with a low recurrence risk did (7%, 2 of 30). CONCLUSIONS: This is
among the first studies to describe patients’ experiences with genomic testing for recurrence risk. Although many
women understood discussions about their genomic test results, a third reported not fully understanding these discussions, suggesting a need to aid and improve risk communication and treatment decision making. Cancer

KEYWORDS: breast cancer, genomic testing, risk communication, recurrence risk, decision making, adjuvant therapy.

Genomic testing is an increasingly important part of clinical practice that presents new opportunities and challenges.
For example, genomic tests, such as Oncotype DX and MammaPrint, offer more precise breast cancer recurrence risk
estimates than standard clinical and pathologic factors.1-4 Patients and their physicians can use genomic test results to
guide decisions about adjuvant treatment. Women with high recurrence risk may opt for more aggressive treatment (ie,
adjuvant chemotherapy), whereas those with lower recurrence risk may safely avoid overtreatment5,6 and its potential side
effects. However, the magnitude of benefit from chemotherapy is not as clear for women with intermediate recurrence
risks.7
Although genomic tests can help inform treatment decisions, a challenge is how best to communicate and incorporate test results when making complex decisions about adjuvant treatment for cancer. Informed decision making about adjuvant treatments often involves discussions regarding patients’ chances of recurrence. To date, there is little consensus
regarding the most effective method to communicate risk information. Previous studies have found that although verbal
expressions of risk are easier to use for some, such expressions are often vulnerable to inconsistent interpretations.8 Other
studies have found that some individuals prefer numerical expressions as they offer more precision.8-12 Moreover, cognitive constraints such as low health literacy or low numeracy may result in reduced understanding of medical and probabilistic information.12

Risk Communication and Genomic Testing/Tzeng et al

In light of the potential role of genomic tests in decisions about adjuvant treatment, it is increasingly important to understand how women receive, understand, and
interpret recurrence risk information. Oncotype DX is 1
such test that continues to gain widespread acceptance by
physicians, third-party payers, and more recently, the
American Society of Clinical Oncology.13 Preliminary
studies have assessed breast cancer survivors’ thoughts
about what it would have been like if they had received
results from a genomic test at the time they were deciding
about chemotherapy.14 However, no published study we
are aware of has described genomic testing from the perspective of patients who actually received the test as part
of routine clinical care.
The present study examined how women with breast
cancer received and understood recurrence risk information based on the genomic test Oncotype DX. We
assessed predictors of women’s perceived understanding
of their test results, their anxiety about getting the test
results, and perceptions of their own breast cancer recurrence risk. Potential correlates included age, actual recurrence risk based on the test, personal history with cancer,
and worry about recurrence. Understanding women’s
experiences with genomic testing allows for early identification of potential challenges and the opportunity to
improve risk communication and treatment decision
making for future patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedure
Eligible women received a mailed questionnaire between
December 2008 and May 2009. They had the option to
complete a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form to allow a review of
their medical records regarding their cancer diagnosis and
treatment. Women received a $15 incentive and up to 2
follow-up letters to maximize response rates. The institutional review board of the University of North Carolina
approved the study protocol and materials.
Participants were women previously treated for early
stage breast cancer at the University of North Carolina
Breast Center (Chapel Hill, NC), whose medical records
indicated they received the Oncotype DX test from the
time the test was first available in June 2004 through
March 2009. These women had stage I or II, lymph nodenegative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer; we also
included 1 woman with lymph node-positive breast cancer, because the test has been validated for some women

with lymph node-positive breast cancers.15 Exclusion criteria were not speaking English or age <18 years.
Oncotype DX, which is performed on breast tumor
tissue removed during surgery, estimates the risk for breast
cancer recurrence assuming the patient receives adjuvant
hormone therapy. Research has validated Oncotype DX
for women with stage I or II, lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers, as well as some
women with lymph node-positive breast cancers.15 The
test yields a Recurrence Score that corresponds to a
10-year distant recurrence risk estimate (0%-100%).2,4
According to Oncotype DX test reports, recurrence risks
are low if estimates are approximately 11% or less, intermediate if estimates are between 12% and 21%, and high
for estimates >21%.
Measures
Participant characteristics

The questionnaire assessed common demographic
characteristics, including age, race, and income, as well as
self-reported personal and family history of cancer, time
since diagnosis, and treatments received. We assessed
rurality of residence by comparing their zip code to a
national database16,17 (small town, large rural town, or
urban area). We reviewed medical records of participants
who signed HIPAA authorization forms to obtain information about tumor stage, nodal status, hormone receptor status, type of breast cancer surgery, adjuvant
treatments, and 10-year distant recurrence risk based on
Oncotype DX.
Numeracy and literacy

We assessed numeracy with a 3-item scale18 (potential range, 0-3 correct answers) and literacy using the Single Item Literacy Screener.19 The literacy item assessed
how often respondents need help with written healthrelated materials. Response options ranged from ‘‘never’’
to ‘‘always,’’ and were reverse-coded during analysis to
range from a level of low to high literacy.
Breast cancer worry

We included 4 items adapted from the Cancer
Worry Scale assessing worry about breast cancer recurrence.20 The items assessed how often during the last 4
weeks women thought about their chances of getting
breast cancer again, and how often these thoughts affected
their mood and daily functioning. The 4-point response
scale ranged from ‘‘rarely or never’’ to ‘‘(almost) all the
time.’’

Learning about the test

One item assessed whether participants had heard
about Oncotype DX before their diagnosis. We assessed
participants’ receipt of information about the test, including printed materials and information told verbally. Participants could indicate if they did not receive any printed
materials or oral information about the test.
Getting the test results

Women indicated whether their physicians
described test results using ‘‘numbers (such as ‘6%
chance’),’’ ‘‘words (such as ‘low risk’, or ‘high risk’),’’
‘‘graphics, such as a chart,’’ or ‘‘other (space provided to
describe).’’ They also reported their perceived understanding of what they were told about their recurrence risk
based on the test, accompanied by a 5-point response scale
ranging from ‘‘nothing at all’’ to ‘‘everything.’’ Two items
assessed women’s affirmation of feeling anxious and worried when they received the test results, ranging from
‘‘strongly disagree’’ to ‘‘strongly agree.’’ Because the 2
items were highly correlated (r ¼ 0.87, P < .001), we
averaged the items to form a test-related distress scale.
Attitudes toward Oncotype DX testing

Two items assessed women’s attitudes regarding
genomic testing, including a statement about recommending the test to other women in similar situations,
and a statement concerning having the test if they had to
decide again today. To assess perceived consequences of
genomic testing, we adapted 7 items from the O’Neill
scale14 to form the ‘‘perceived benefits’’ and ‘‘perceived
concerns’’ subscales. Three items shared the theme of concerns about testing (a ¼ .69), and 4 items shared a theme
of perceived benefits (a ¼ .70).

ceived recurrence risk by asking what they thought was
the percentage chance of their breast cancer coming back
in the next 10 years (0%-100%) (ie, ‘‘Aside from what
your doctor said, what do you think is the percent chance
of your breast cancer coming back in the next 10 years?’’).
Treatment decisions

One item assessed women’s preferred role in treatment decision making, and a second asked how women
and their physicians decided on breast cancer treatments.21 Both questions had the following response
options: ‘‘I prefer to make my own decision regardless of
my doctor’s opinion,’’ ‘‘I prefer to make my own decision
after seriously considering my doctor’s opinion,’’ ‘‘I prefer
that my doctor and I share responsibility for deciding,’’ ‘‘I
prefer that my doctor makes the decision, but seriously
consider my opinion,’’ and ‘‘I prefer to leave the decision
to my doctor.’’ Similar to previous studies,22,23 we coded
the first 2 response options as ‘‘active,’’ the third option as
‘‘shared,’’ and the last 2 options as ‘‘passive.’’ We assessed
receipt of chemotherapy and other adjuvant treatments by
relying on medical records for participants who completed HIPAA authorization (n ¼ 68) and self-report for
participants who did not (n ¼ 9).
Data Analyses
We examined correlates of perceived understanding of
discussions related to results from the test, distress from
getting test results, and perceived recurrence risk using
bivariate linear regression, reporting results as correlation
coefficients. We compared recalled, objective, and perceived recurrence risk using repeated-measures analysis of
variance that yielded an F statistic. Data were analyzed
using 2-tailed tests performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Ill). Analyses used a critical alpha of .05.

Recurrence risk

Two items assessed participants’ recall of specific
words and percentages physicians used to describe their
10-year distant recurrence risk based on the test (eg,
‘‘What did your doctor say was the percentage chance that
your breast cancer will come back in the next 10 years
based on the test?’’). The first item had a 5-point response
scale ranging from ‘‘very low chance’’ to ‘‘very high
chance,’’ and the second item asked for a percentage
chance. We assessed participants’ recall accuracy by calculating the difference between women’s recalled recurrence
risk (in percentages) and their objective recurrence risk
from Oncotype DX (also in percentages). In addition to
participants’ recalled recurrence risk, we assessed per-

RESULTS
Participants
Of 104 women we invited to participate, 78 completed
surveys. We did not analyze data for 1 woman, because
she did not receive her test result. We report percentages
for the entire sample (n ¼ 77) and percentages (n/N)
when results are for a subsample. On average, women
were 58 years old (Table 1). Most were Caucasian (77%),
and had at least a college degree (55%), a household
income of at least $60,000 (60%), and health insurance
(92%). Many respondents reported having a family history of cancer (52%) or a previous cancer diagnosis

Learning About the Test
Only a few women (11%, 8 of 76) had heard of the Oncotype DX test before their diagnosis. Most women recalled
receiving some type of information about the test (97%)
from their medical oncologists. Some women recalled
being only told verbally about the test (15%, 11 of 75),
whereas the majority remembered receiving printed materials in addition to verbal information (83%, 62 of 75).

Discussing test results with their physicians

In addition to receiving information about the test,
most women recalled discussing their recurrence risk test
result (93%, 69 of 74). They recalled their medical oncologists describing their test results using combinations of
risk formats, usually using a combination of words and
numbers (46%, 33 of 71), or a combination of words,
numbers, and graphs (38%, 27 of 71). A few women
recalled receiving words only (14%, 6 of 71), words and
graphs (4%, 3 of 71), numbers and graphs (1%, 1 of 71),
or numbers only (1%, 1 of 71). The majority of women
believed they understood a large amount or all of what
they were told about their recurrence risk based on their
test results (67%, 47 of 70). Women who had greater perceived understanding of these discussions had received
printed materials about the test (Table 2).

(n ¼ 2), Hodgkin lymphoma (n ¼ 2), and uterine cancer

cancer diagnoses and participating in the study was 16
months (range, 4-54 months). Most women had stage I
breast cancer (79%) and breast-conserving surgery (65%,
44 of 68) with radiation (60%). Approximately 37% of
women received a mastectomy (25 of 68). Approximately

Cancer

April 15, 2010

Approximately 26% (17 of 65) of women for whom
we obtained Oncotype DX test results agreed or strongly
agreed that getting the test result made them worried and
anxious. Greater endorsement of test-related distress was
associated with higher actual recurrence risk based on the
test, as the majority of women who experienced testrelated distress had intermediate or high recurrence risks
based on their test results (low ¼ 18%, 6 of 33; intermediate ¼ 30%, 7 of 23; high ¼ 44%, 4 of 9). Stronger feelings of distress were also related to getting chemotherapy,
not getting radiation, and having more frequent worry
about breast cancer recurrence (Table 2).

Attitudes toward Oncotype DX

Recurrence Risk

Most women said that they would have the test if
they had to decide again today (96%), and they would recommend the test to other women in the same situation
(95%). Almost all women agreed that having the test gave
them a better understanding of their treatment options’
chances of success (95%). Approximately 3=4 said they
trusted the test results (77%, 57 of 74), believed they were
accurate (71%, 53 of 75), and found the test useful because
it could determine with certainty whether their cancer had
a high chance of coming back (76%, 57 of 75). Few
women agreed that they had the test only because other
family members wanted them to (8%), the test had a negative effect on their family (5%), or that information about
one’s cancer is better left unknown (3%, 2 of 76). Women
with higher perceived benefits scores were less concerned
about genomic testing (r ¼ 0.38, P ¼ .001). Women’s
perceived benefits and concerns were not related to their
actual, recalled, or perceived recurrence risk, nor were they
related to their perceived understanding of discussions
about their genomic-based recurrence risk.

Recalled recurrence risk

1996

Women’s actual recurrence risk (if only hormone
therapy is used) based on the test was 12.5% on average
(standard deviation [SD], 6.3%; range, 4%-32%). When
asked to recall their genomic-based recurrence risk,
women reported 13.1% on average (SD, 9.2%; range,
2.5%-50%), which did not differ from their recurrence
risk based on the test (t ¼ 0.69, P ¼ .49). A little over
2=3 of respondents (71%, 35 of 49) recalled a recurrence
risk that was within 4% of their recurrence risk based on
the test. Recalled recurrence risk was strongly correlated
with their actual recurrence risk (r ¼ 0.70, P < .001).
Perceived recurrence risk

Women perceived their recurrence risk to be 14.1%
on average (SD, 19%; range, 0%-100%), which was equivalent to their actual and recalled recurrence risk based on
the test (F < 1). Women’s actual recurrence risk based on
the test was related to their perceptions of breast cancer recurrence risk. The averages of the mean perceived

recurrence risks for the test result risk categories were 9.6%
(low), 18.0% (intermediate), and 25.8% (high). Higher
perceived recurrence risk was associated with getting chemotherapy, having received printed materials about the test,
having a previous cancer diagnosis, and reporting more frequent worry about breast cancer recurrence (Table 2).

Figure 1. Women’s receipt of chemotherapy according to
genomic-based recurrence risk is shown. Analyses excluded
6 women who participated in the TAILORx clinical trial.

Treatment Decisions
We examined women’s preferences when making medical
decisions and examined whether their preferences were
met when deciding about their breast cancer treatments.
Most women preferred having an active (38%) or shared
(49%) role in medical decisions (Table 3). In their actual
decisions about breast cancer treatment, a little over a
quarter of women reported a different style from what
they preferred, thus suggesting they did not achieve their
preferred decision-making approach (26%). We further
explored this group of 20 women who did not achieve
their preferred approach, and found that all had initially
preferred a shared role with their physician. When
actually deciding about their breast cancer treatments, 7
of the women reported having a more passive role compared with what they originally preferred, and 13 reported
having a more active role.
At the time of the survey, almost all women had
started hormonal therapy (91%). Approximately 1=3 of
women (32%, 25 of 77) had received chemotherapy as
part of their adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. We
excluded 6 women who were involved in the TAILORx
clinical trial, as these women may have experienced a different decision-making process, because the trial involved
assignment to treatment based on recurrence risk. Most
women who received chemotherapy had a high or intermediate recurrence risk as indicated by their Oncotype
DX test result (Fig. 1). Overall, the majority of women
with low or high recurrence risks received adjuvant treatments that were consistent with common treatment recommendations (90%, 35 of 39). Only 2 women with a
low recurrence risk based on the test received chemotherapy, whereas 2 women with a high recurrence risk did not.

DISCUSSION
Genomic testing shows promise as a valuable tool for
helping physicians and their patients select optimal adjuvant treatments for early stage breast cancer. Such tests
have the potential to increase the number of women who
can forgo unnecessary treatments without compromising
the outcome or quality of care. As genomic testing
becomes more widely accepted in clinical care, it is important to understand the patient’s perspective of receiving
and using genomic-based information. We conducted a
cross-sectional study of women who were among the first
to receive genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence
risk. Consistent with the primary aim of Oncotype DX,
women’s receipt of chemotherapy was strongly associated
with their recurrence risk based on the test. Most women
with a high genomic-based recurrence risk received chemotherapy, whereas most women with a low recurrence risk
did not.
The majority of women had not heard of Oncotype
DX before their diagnosis, suggesting that most experience a learning curve as they incorporate test results into
decisions about adjuvant treatment. Despite their limited
exposure to genomic testing, most women accurately
recalled their recurrence risk based on the test, and many
believed they understood a large amount or all of what
they discussed with their physician based on their test
result. Informed decision-making requires that patients
accurately understand their risk. On the basis of these 2
findings, it seems that physicians are successfully incorporating genomic test results and promoting informed decision making about adjuvant treatment options. However,
it is important to remember that 1=3 of women believed

they understood only a moderate amount or less during
these important discussions. Women who believed they
understood less did not receive printed materials about
the test. Our findings suggest that a way to help women
achieve greater perceived understanding may be to provide printed materials about the test.
Previous studies have found that having higher health
literacy and numeracy increases patients’ ability to accurately recall information about recurrence risk testing24 and
to compare and calculate treatment benefits.25 In contrast,
we did not find numeracy-, literacy-, or education-related
differences in our outcomes. Potential reasons include a
small sample size, demographic homogeneity, and a brief
measurement of literacy and numeracy. As previous research
has indicated the importance of health literacy and numeracy in effective risk communication, more research is needed
to clarify the role of numeracy and literacy in communicating genomic-based information.
We found test-related distress, which we defined as
worry or anxiety when receiving test results, in at least a
quarter of women who received the test. Greater affirmation of these feelings was associated with having a higher
genomic-based recurrence risk, more frequent worry
about future breast cancer recurrence, and receiving radiation and chemotherapy. Consistent with literature on
genetic testing for cancer susceptibility,20,26,27 having a
higher genomic-based recurrence risk was associated with
feelings of test-related distress. Our findings demonstrate
the need to further evaluate the psychosocial impact of
genomic testing as well as having a higher genomic-based
recurrence risk. However, whether test-related anxiety or
worry reached clinical significance was not assessed and
may be a useful measure for future studies. Future work
should also attempt to distinguish between distress from
receiving an unfavorable test result (ie, high risk) and distress from receiving a test result that does not presently
lead to clear recommendations about chemotherapy (ie,
intermediate risk), which may force the patient to have
greater than preferred involvement in the decision.
Women’s objective, recalled, and perceived recurrence risks were surprisingly similar, with averages ranging
from 12.5% to 14.1%. Studies commonly show that
many women overestimate their chances of getting breast
cancer, a meaningful number underestimate this risk, but
few have accurate risk perceptions.28 Although some studies suggest modest improvements in cancer risk perception accuracy after counseling,29-31 others have found
continued inaccuracy and resistance to risk information.32,33 It is important to note, however, that the major-

1998

ity of cancer risk communication studies are of cancer-free
individuals, whereas our study assessed risk perception after diagnosis. One potential explanation for the relative
concordance between women’s actual and perceived
recurrence risks is that individuals diagnosed with cancer
receive and process risk information more attentively than
those who have never been diagnosed. This is an important and potentially valuable direction for future research
on genomic testing and cancer risk communication.
On further examination, we found that women’s
recalled and perceived recurrence risks were each associated
with their objective recurrence risk estimates. However, there
was no association between recalled and perceived recurrence
risks. Furthermore, we found notable differences in correlates between participants’ recalled and perceived breast cancer recurrence risk, which suggest that distinct cognitive
processes may be involved in women’s understanding of the
recurrence risk information they receive and interpreting the
information as one’s individualized recurrence risk.
Consistent with previous research on women’s preferences in treatment decision making, we found that
nearly a quarter of women did not achieve their preferred
decision-making style.34,35 This is particularly concerning
because previous studies found less decisional satisfaction
and more decisional regret among women who did not
achieve their preferred decision-making style.36-38 These
findings are among the first to describe women’s preferred
and actual decision making with Oncotype DX, and highlight the need for greater sensitivity to women’s preferences when selecting treatments. This is particularly
important given that decisions about adjuvant treatment
may now involve additional recurrence risk information
provided by genomic tests such as Oncotype DX.
Approximately 1=3 of women in our study received
recurrence risk test results determined as intermediate, a
category for which chemotherapy benefits are least clear.
The long-term impact of having an intermediate-range
recurrence risk remains unknown. Our findings suggest
that test-related distress and perceived recurrence risk
increased approximately linearly as actual recurrence risk
(based on the test) increased. Furthermore, the intermediate risk group had mean levels of test-related distress and
perceived recurrence risk that were between the low and
high recurrence risk groups. Results from the TAILORx
trial may further refine the identification of women with
intermediate recurrence risk who will benefit from chemotherapy and those who can go without.7,39
Overall, results suggest that women are satisfied
with genomic testing, given that they would recommend

the test to other women and would have the test if they
had to decide again. They also saw many benefits and few
concerns about genomic testing. Women’s perceived benefits and consequences of genomic testing were not related
to their genomic-based recurrence risk, which suggests
that women find genomic testing useful regardless of their
recurrence risk based on the test.
This study has several limitations, including a retrospective cross-sectional design that limits our ability to
draw conclusions regarding temporal or causal relationships. The small sample of women was the first to receive
Oncotype DX at the University of North Carolina Breast
Center. Despite the high response rate, the generalizability of our findings to other women who have received the
test is not yet known. Participants were mostly Caucasian,
well-educated women who had health insurance and came
from urbanized areas. Most findings relied on self-report
and recall, which can be unreliable. However, their recall
of the test results was quite accurate, on average. Despite
the limitations described above, this study is among the
first to describe the experiences of genomic testing from
the patient’s perspective, and offers a glimpse into future
directions for improving risk communication related to
genomic testing. Specific areas to focus include additional
probing of the risk formats and test-related material that
physicians used, examining women’s information-seeking
behavior outside the clinic, and testing educational materials about the test that are currently being distributed as
well as those under development. Future research should
examine the impact of genomic testing on decisions about
adjuvant therapy as well as other possible treatmentrelated decisions.
In conclusion, genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence risk was well received by women with early stage breast
cancer. Most women had high perceived understanding of
what they discussed with physicians regarding their test
results. However, a significant number of women did not
fully understand discussions about their genomic-based recurrence risk, which presents the need to continue developing optimal ways to communicate and ensure both
perceived and actual comprehension of genomic-based information. Finally, women with intermediate and high
genomic-based recurrence risks deserve special attention, as
they are more likely to suffer from worry about recurrence
and distress regarding their test result.
