ABSTRACT
Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4) has previously been
reported to be upregulated in various cancers. However, the physiological functions
of PEBP4 in gastric cancer are still unknown. Aiming to clarify the properties and
role of PEBP4 in the development and invasion of gastric cancer, we performed
several biological assays and a knockdown assay. The expression level of PEBP4
was shown to be significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissue samples, and
knockdown of the expression of PEBP4 induced significant inhibitory effects on cell
proliferation, migration and invasiveness. In addition, it was demonstrated that PEBP4
was associated with the development and invasion of gastric cancer cells through
activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Our findings supported the hypothesis
that PEBP4 might be a novel potential drug target for the treatment of gastric cancer.

cancer development and invasion is still lacking. In this
study, we silenced the expression of PEBP4 by specific
siRNA in gastric cancer cell lines and investigated the
effects of PEBP4 on cell proliferation, migration and
invasion. Our results show that the effects of PEBP4 on
the tumorigenesis and metastasis of gastric cancer depend
on the dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer is one of the main contributors
to cancer-related mortality worldwide [1]. Despite
recent developments in early diagnosis and other novel
therapeutic strategies, the median survival time for
advanced gastric cancer patients has still remained at
approximately 7 months [2, 3]. Thus, investigations into
the molecular mechanisms of invasion and metastasis of
gastric cancer seek to contribute to the development of a
novel and effective drug target.
Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4
(PEBP4) is a member of the PEBP family, which shares
a similar domain consisting of a C-terminal large β-sheet
flanked by smaller β-sheets and 2 α-helices [4]. It has been
reported that PEBP4 plays important roles in multiple
biological processes, including the synthesis of the cell
membrane, myoblast differentiation, neural development
and tumorigenesis [5–8]. Recently, the upregulation
of PEBP4 was reported to be associated with the
proliferation, invasion and drug resistance of tumor cells
[9, 10]. However, direct evidence for the role of PEBP4 in

RESULTS
PEBP4 is highly expressed in gastric cancer
tissue and cell lines
To explore the potential role of PEBP4 in the
tumorigenesis of gastric cancer, the mRNA levels of
PEBP4 were studied in gastric cancer tissue samples and
the corresponding adjacent normal tissue samples from
11 patients using RT-qPCR. The mRNA levels of PEBP4
in human gastric cancer tissue were significantly higher
than those in the adjacent normal gastric tissue, as shown
in Figure 1A. The western blot results showed that the
expression level of the PEBP4 protein was markedly

normal gastric tissue samples (Figure 1B). Similarly, the
mRNA and protein expression levels of PEBP4 were also
increased in gastric cancer cell lines (Figure 1C and 1D).

transfected with siRNA-PEBP4 or siRNA-control.
The western blot results demonstrated a remarkable
downregulation of PEBP4 expression in TSGH and AGS
cells (Figure 2A). The results of the cell proliferation assay
indicated that knockdown of PEBP4 greatly suppressed
the proliferation of both types of cells in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 2B). Additionally, knockdown of PEBP4
resulted in a remarkable reduction in tumor cell migration
and invasion (Figure 3).
Interestingly, knockdown of PEBP4 was found
to retard the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)

phenotype in gastric cancer cells. The RT-qPCR results
indicated that knockdown of PEBP4 resulted in a
significant increase in the mRNA levels of E-cadherin and
a decrease in N-cadherin in TSGH cells (Figure 4A) and
AGS cells (Figure 4B). Similarly, the western blot results
also suggested an inhibitory effect on the EMT in gastric
tumor cells upon knockdown of PEBP4 (Figure 4C).
It was observed that knockdown of PEBP4 greatly
inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, suggesting
that PEBP4 might exert its physiological functions via
modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Figure 5).

[11]. For example, PEBP4 has been reported to be
upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),
and knockdown of PEBP4 has been shown to result in
the attenuation of cancer cell growth, migration, and
metastasis of PDAC cancer cells [10]. In lung cancer,
PEBP4 is capable of enhancing the cell proliferation
and invasion ability [12]. Liu et al. reported that PEBP4
in colorectal cancer tissues was markedly increased and
the downregulation of PEBP4 significantly reduced
the migration of colorectal cancer cells in a Transwell
chamber [13].
In the present study, PEBP4 was first demonstrated
to be upregulated in gastric cancer tissue samples and cell
lines. Knockdown of PEBP4 inhibited cell proliferation,
migration and invasiveness. EMT is an important
process during tumor development, characterized by

DISCUSSION
PEBP4 has been reported to be involved in the
tumor development and metastasis of various cancers

reduced intercellular adhesion and enhanced motility of
epithelial cells [14]. As one of the markers of EMT, the
measurement of the levels of E-cadherin and N-cadherin
was a crucial approach to investigate the EMT phenotype
and then evaluate tumor invasion [15]. In the present
study, knockdown of PEBP4 was found to remarkably
increase the expression of E-cadherin and decrease the
expression of N-cadherin in TSGH and AGS cells. The

results suggested that knockdown of PEBP4 retarded the
EMT process in gastric cancer cells, which might have
contributed to the inhibitory effect of the siRNA-PEBP4
on tumor migration and invasion.
The PI3K/Akt pathway was determined to be
associated with proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis and
EMT in gastric cancer [16–21]. Treatment of gastric
cancer cells with a PI3K/Akt kinase inhibitor significantly

retarded the EMT phenotype by inhibiting bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 [22, 23]. PEBP4 was
previously found to be crucial for the phosphorylation
of Akt at serine473 [10]. Additionally, the silencing of
hPEBP4 in TRAIL-resistant human prostate cancer cells
inhibited Akt activation [24]. In this study, it was also
found that knockdown of PEBP4 markedly inhibited the
phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in gastric cancer cells.
Together, the results in this study supported the
hypothesis that knockdown of PEBP4 inhibits cell
invasion and EMT through suppressing the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway. These results suggest that PEBP4 might
be potential drug target for the treatment of gastric cancer.

manufacturer’s instructions, and then cells were incubated
at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 48 h before the siRNA
knockdown assay.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell migration and invasion assays

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were transfected with siRNA-PEBP4 and
siRNA control. After 24 h of serum starvation, the cells
were incubated with BrdU solution at 37°C for 24 or 48
h using the cell proliferation ELISA BrdU kit (Takara
Biotechnology, Dalian, China). The amount of BrdU was
measured at 450 nm by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA).

The invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells
upon downregulation of PEBP4 were analyzed by a
Transwell chamber (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge,
MA, USA) assay. The TSGH and AGS cells treated with
siRNA-PEBP4 or siRNA-control (1×105 cells/ml) were
added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber of the
Transwell was filled with 500 μl DMEM containing
10% FBS as a chemo-attractant. After 24 h incubation,
cells on the surface of the upper chamber were removed
by scraping with a cotton swab. The migrated cells on
the lower surface of the chamber were stained with
0.1% crystal violet (Sigma, MO) and counted. These
experiments were repeated three times.
For the invasion assay, cells were seeded onto a
Matrigel-coated membrane matrix (BD Biosciences,
Bedford, MA, USA) in a 24-well culture plate for 24 h
after transfection. The cells that did not invade through the
pores were carefully wiped with cotton wool. Then, cells
located on the lower surface of the chamber were stained
with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma, MO) and counted. These
experiments were repeated three times.

Tissue sample collection
Gastric cancer tissue samples were obtained from 11
patients undergoing surgical treatment at the Department
of Oncology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital
(China), during the period from 2014 to 2015 (average
age=59.6). All of the patients received primary treatments
by surgery, chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Healthy
tissue samples were from non-pathologic areas distant
from the tumors in surgical specimens. The fresh tissue
specimens were immediately snap-frozen and stored in
liquid nitrogen until use. The protocol for the use of patient
samples was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee
of the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital.

Cell culture
Three human gastric cancer cell lines (TSGH, N87
and AGS) and a normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line
(GES-1) were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco,
Rockville, MD), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin
(100 μg/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), and sodium pyruvate
(1 mM) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C.

RNA extraction and quantification using reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from gastric cancer tissue
and cells using Trizol reagent (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA was prepared using the EasyScript FirstStrand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR amplification was
performed using the following primers: PEBP4,
5’-ACTGGGTCTCATGATGGTGG-3’ (sense), and
5’-CTCCATCCAGGAGGTGATCT-3’ (antisense); and
β-actin, 5’-TTAGTTGCGTTACACCCTTTC-3’ (sense)
and 5’-ACCTTCACCGTTCCAGTTT-3’ (antisense). The
RT-qPCR conditions included an initial denaturation step
at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min, and a final elongation
step at 72°C for 10 min.

siRNA knockdown of PEBP4
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) for PEBP4
knockdown was designed and synthesized by Guangzhou
RiboBio (Guangzhou, China), and the primer sequences
for PEBP4 were: 5’-ACTGGGTCTCATGATGGTGG-3’,
and
5’-CTCCATCCAGGAGGTGATCT-3’;
and the primer sequences for β-actin were:
5’-TTAGTTGCGTTACACCCTTTC-3’
and
5’-ACCTTCACCGTTCCAGTTT-3’. For transfection,
the cells were seeded in a 24-well plate for 24 h until
they reached 50% confluence. The cells were transfected
with 2 μl (20 μM) siRNA using a Lipofectamine™ 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the

The expression levels of desired proteins extracted
from gastric cancer tissues were analyzed using a standard
western blot assay. Proteins were transferred onto
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore,
Boston, MA, USA). The treated membrane was incubated
in primary antibodies (anti-PEBP4, anti-E-cadherin, antiN-cadherin, anti-PI3K, anti-p-PI3K, anti-p-Akt, anti-Akt
and anti-GAPDH) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) at 4°C overnight. Membranes were
then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies. The protein concentrations
were visualized and calculated by chemiluminescence
(Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and
BandScan 5.0 software.
