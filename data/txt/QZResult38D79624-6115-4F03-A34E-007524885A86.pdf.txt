Abstract
Glioma-initiating cells (GIC) have stem-like cell properties
thought to be sufﬁcient for recurrence, progression, and drug
resistance in glioblastomas. In the present study, we deﬁned
miRNA (miR)-340 as a differentially expressed miRNA in
human GICs that inhibit GIC-mediated tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we deﬁned tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT) as a
critical direct target of miR340 for inhibition. Among miRNAs
screened, we found that miR340 expression was decreased in all
human GICs and in human glioblastoma tissues, compared
with human neural stem cells and normal brain tissues.

miR340 overexpression in GICs suppressed their proliferative,
invasive, and migratory properties in vitro, triggering cell senescence in vitro and inhibiting GIC-induced tumorigenesis in
mouse brains. shRNA-mediated silencing of PLAT in GICs
phenocopied the effects of miR340 overexpression in vitro and
in vivo, suggesting a potential role for tissue factor in stem-like
cell function. Taken together, our results identiﬁed miR340
as a tumor suppressor that functions in GIC to enforce PLAT
blockade and ablate their stem-like functions. Cancer Res; 75(6);

Introduction

ing of speciﬁc target mRNAs and that are currently recognized as
important regulators of tumorigenesis and development (8).
Many miRNAs have been reported to be aberrantly expressed in
malignant gliomas and play a role in determining the degree of
malignancy. These include miR21, miR221/222, miR124, and
miR128 (9–12). These miRNAs can act as either oncogenes or
tumor suppressors in gliomas, depending on their effects on cell
proliferation and apoptosis. However, there are few studies on
integrated functions of miRNAs that signiﬁcantly regulate tumorigenesis and tumor development initiated by GICs.
In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed the miRNA
expression proﬁles of human GICs (hGIC) and identiﬁed miR340
as a novel miRNA that is signiﬁcantly downregulated in hGICs
compared with human neural stem cells (NSC). Functional
analyses revealed that miR340 suppressed hGIC proliferation,
invasion, and migration in vitro, as well as hGIC tumorigenesis in
vivo, in the mouse brain. Furthermore, we deﬁned tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT) gene as a direct target of miR340. These
results indicate that GICs with the decreased level of miR340
promote glioblastoma formation in the mouse brain and that
miR340 downregulation can induce a variety of malignant processes, such as cell proliferation and diffuse invasion. We also
demonstrated that these effects are primarily mediated by
increased levels of the target molecule PLAT. These ﬁndings reveal
miR340 and its target gene PLAT as potentially useful therapeutic
candidates for the treatment of glioblastoma.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and
aggressive malignant brain tumor. Despite the most intensive
current therapeutic efforts, the median survival time (14
months) has not changed signiﬁcantly in decades (1). The
extremely poor prognosis of patients with GBM is likely because
of the presence of glioma-initiating cells (GIC; also known as
glioma stem-like cells), which are equivalent of the cancer stem
cells (CSC) observed in other cancer types (2–4). CSCs are not
only highly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy (5–7) but are
also highly tumorigenic; thus, these cells are thought to be the
primary cause of tumor recurrence and progression. To improve
the poor prognosis of patients with GBM, it is important to
understand the mechanism that GICs are activated to have high
tumorigenesis and invasion.
miRNAs (miR) are small, noncoding RNAs of approximately 22
nucleotides in length that mediate the posttranscriptional silenc1

the pathway analysis.
The microarray data have been submitted to NCBI GEO and
available under GSE61078, GSE61079, and GSE61080.

Glioma-initiating cell culture and cell lines
Seven primary human glioma samples [ﬁve GBMs (E1-4, 6),
one anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), and one diffuse astrocytoma (DA)] were used to prepare the hGICs. These seven
samples were obtained from Ehime University Hospital with the
patients' consent according to the Research Ethics Committee
guidelines and were used in compliance with the research guidelines of the Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine
and the Institute for Genetic Medicine of Hokkaido University.
Tumor samples were dissociated using a papain dissociation
system (Worthington) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The dissociated cells were cultured to form tumor spheres in
serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 (Wako) supplemented with
human basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF; 10 nmol/L), human
EGF (10 nmol/L), heparin (5 mmol/L), N2 supplement (Wako),
10 mg/mL insulin (Wako), GlutaMAX supplement, 100 U/mL
penicillin G, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. For IHC, GICs were
cultured on poly-D-lysine (15 mg/mL, Sigma)-coated and ﬁbronectin (1 mg/mL)-coated 8-well chamber slides (Nunc). The
human glioma cell lines U251 and U87 (obtained from ATCC)
were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Thermo Scientiﬁc). The
mouse GIC lines NSCL61 and OPCL61, that have been established by overexpression of oncogenic HRasL61 in p53-deﬁcient
mouse NSC and oligodendrocyte precursor cell, were cultured as
described previously (13, 14). Human NSCs (H9 human embryonic stem cell derived; Invitrogen) were cultured according to the
supplier's instructions. The cells were maintained at 37 C under a
humidiﬁed 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere for all of the experiments. The characterization of human GICs is presented in the
Supplementary Fig. S1.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from GICs, glioma cells, and glioblastoma and normal brain tissues using Isogen reagent (Nippon
Gene). Then, total RNA was reverse-transcribed using MultiScribe
Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) and MMLV RT (Invitrogen) according to the suppliers' instructions. miR340 expression was analyzed using TaqMan small RNA assays (Applied
Biosystems) and a MiniOpticon RT-PCR System (Bio-Rad)
according to the suppliers' instructions. PLAT expression was
analyzed using FastStart Universal SYBR Green (Roche) with a
MiniOpticon RT-PCR System. The PCR conditions were as
follows: 10 minutes at 95 C; followed by 40 cycles of 95 C
for 15 seconds and 60 C for 1 minute. All of the expression
values were normalized against b-actin mRNA expression levels.
The RT-PCR primers for PLAT and b-actin are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Microarray hybridization and data processing
Total RNA was extracted from GICs, glioma cells, and glioma
tissues using the TRIzol Plus RNA Puriﬁcation System (Invitrogen). The miRNA microarrays were manufactured by Agilent
Technologies, and 100 ng total RNA was hybridized using the
miRNA Microarray Kit protocol for use with Human miRNA
Microarray Release 16.0 or Mouse miRNA Microarray Release
16.0. Hybridization signals were detected using a DNA microarray
scanner (Agilent Technologies), and the scanned images were
analyzed using Agilent Feature Extraction software.
For the gene expression analyses, total RNA was ampliﬁed and
labeled with cy3 using a one-color Agilent Low Input Quick Amp
Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled cRNAs were fragmented and hybridized to the Agilent Human GE 860K Microarray. After washing,
the microarrays were scanned using a DNA microarray scanner.
Intensity values for each scanned feature were quantiﬁed using
Agilent Feature Extraction software, which also performs background subtraction corrections.
Data normalization was conducted using Agilent GeneSpring
GX version 11.0.2 software. After normalization, hierarchical
sample clustering of the expressed genes was performed using
the Euclidean distance and average linkage methods (Agilent
GeneSpring GX). We used the freely available GenMAPP 2.1
database (http://www.genmapp.org/) and ConPath Navigator

Transfections
Either the precursor form of miR340 or a control miRNA was
overexpressed in GICs and glioma cells using miRNA lentiviral
particles (pEZX-MR03; GeneCopoeia) according to the supplier's
instructions. In certain experiments, cells were transfected with a
miR340 expression vector (pBApoCMV-Neo-miR340, Takara)
using a Nucleofector device (Lonza) and cultured in the presence
of neomycin (300 mg/mL; Sigma) for 10 days.
Cell proliferation and cell-cycle analyses
GICs and glioma cells (1104 cells/well) were transfected with
either a control vector or a miR340 expression vector and cultured
for 72 hours. Cells were collected on days 1, 2, and 3 and counted
using a hemocytometer. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining
was performed as previously described (15). Cell-cycle analysis
was performed using propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis (BD FACSCalibur, Cycletest Plus DNA Reagent Kit, BD
Biosciences) according to the supplier's instructions.
Cell invasion and migration assays
Cell invasion and migration were assessed using a BioCoat
Matrigel Invasion Chamber (Becton-Dickinson) and the BioCoat Cell Culture Inserts (Becton-Dickinson), respectively.
Brieﬂy, transfected GICs and glioma cells (5–10104) were
resuspended in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium, which was supplemented with 1 mg/mL BSA (Sigma), and transferred to the
upper chamber of each well. Then, medium containing 10%
FBS was added to the lower chamber. After incubation for 12
hours, the cells on the upper membrane surface were mechanically removed. Cells that had invaded or migrated to the lower
side of the membrane were ﬁxed, stained with 0.1% crystal
violet, and counted the amount of cells in ﬁve random ﬁelds
under a microscope (400).
Intracranial cell transplantation into the brains of NOD/SCID

of 6 to 8-week-old female NOD/SCID mice that had been
anesthetized with 10% pentobarbital. The stereotactic coordinates of the injection site were 2 mm forward from lambda, 2
mm lateral to the sagittal suture, and 5 mm deep. MRI was
taken to conﬁrm the tumor formation before decapitation of
the mice.
Brain ﬁxation and histopathology
Dissected mouse brains were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde at
4 C overnight. After ﬁxation, the brains were embedded in parafﬁn, cut into 6-mm thick coronal sections, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
IHC
IHC was performed as previously described (15). The following
antibodies were used to detect cellular antigens: mouse monoclonal anti-Nestin (1:200; Pharmingen), mouse monoclonal antiGFAP (1:200; Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-Sox2 (1:200; Stem
Cell Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-PLAT (1:50; Sigma), and
rabbit monoclonal anti-caspase-3 (cleaved; 1:100; Cell Signaling
Technology). The antibodies were detected using either Alexa 488coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Life Technologies) or sheep
anti-rabbit IgG (1:1; Nichirei). The nuclei were counterstained
with DAPI (1 mg/mL) or hematoxylin.

ing site, and cloned it into the pT7Blue-2 vector. The wild and
mutant types of plat 30 UTR DNA were inserted with the ﬁreﬂy
luciferase cDNA into the pcDNA3.1-hyg vector, resulting in
pcDNA3.1-hyg-Luc-PLAT 30 UTR (Luc-PLAT) and pcDNA3.1hyg-Luc-DPLAT 30 UTR (Luc-DPLAT), respectively. The primers
used to generate plat 30 UTR reporter construct are listed in
Supplementary Table S3.
Luciferase assay
hGICs (E3) were transfected with pEF-Rluc (a kind gift from
Koji Shimozaki and Shigekazu Nagata), a luciferase-PLAT vector
(Luc-PLAT or Luc-DPLAT) and a miR expression vector (control
vector or pBApoCMV-Neo-miR340), and their luciferase activities
were measured as previously described (16).
Statistical analyses
The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare two-paired
groups. Kaplan–Meier curves were used to estimate the unadjusted time-to-event variables. Log-rank tests were applied to
compare each time-to-event variable between groups. P values
less than 0.05 (two sided) were considered signiﬁcant. All
statistical analyses were performed using the StatMate software
program.

Results
Senescence-associated-b-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) staining
Cells transfected with either a control or a miR340 overexpression vector were cultured in the presence of 400 mg/mL G418 for
10 days. Then, selected cells were ﬁxed and stained using a SAb-gal staining kit (Calbiochem) according to the supplier's
instructions.
Western blot analysis
Cell or tissue lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and the
proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membrane
(Amersham). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk, and
then incubated in an anti-Nestin (1:1000), anti-Sox2 (1:500),
anti-GFAP (1:500), anti-PLAT (1:250), or anti-GAPDH antibody
(1:2000; Chemicon). After washing, the membrane was incubated in IgG-HRP (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Amersham) was used to detect the
protein bands.
Vector construction
Full-length human plat was ampliﬁed from human glioma
cDNA using RT-PCR and KOD-Plus-Ver.2 polymerase (Toyobo)
according to the manufacturer's instructions and cloned into
the pcDNA3-2FLAG-c vector, resulting in pcDNA3-hPLAT2FLAG-c. The primers used for ampliﬁcation of the full-length
human plat gene are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
To knockdown human plat expression, hairpin sequences were
inserted into the psiRNA-h7SKhygro G1 expression vector (InvivoGen) to produce psiRNA-h7SKhygro-platsh. The shRNA target
sequence was 50 -GAATTCGATGATGACACTT-30 .
To construct a ﬁreﬂy luciferase-human plat 30 untranslated
region (30 UTR) expression vector, human plat 30 UTR genomic
DNA was ampliﬁed using the KOD plus DNA polymerase and
cloned into the pT7Blue-2 vector (Novagen), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. We also ampliﬁed a mutant form
of the plat 30 UTR genomic DNA, with a deleted miR340-bind-

miR340 is a novel miRNA that is downregulated in GICs
To identify novel miRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in GICs,
we analyzed differences in miRNA expression between mouse and
human GICs and control NSCs using miRNA microarrays. We
identiﬁed seven miRNAs that were aberrantly expressed in both
human and mouse GICs, three of which were upregulated and
four of which were downregulated, compared with NSCs. Among
these miRNAs, miR340 was identiﬁed as a novel miRNA that was
signiﬁcantly downregulated in all human and mouse GICs and in
the human glioma cell lines (Fig. 1A). Using qPCR analysis, we
conﬁrmed that miR340 expression was signiﬁcantly decreased in
all examined human and mouse GICs and human glioma cell
lines compared with NSCs (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we determined
that miR340 expression was signiﬁcantly decreased in human
GBM tissues compared with normal human brain tissues
(Fig. 1C).
miR340 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and
promotes cellular senescence in GICs
To examine the function of miR340 in hGICs, we infected
hGICs and glioma cell lines with a recombinant lentivirus encoding either GFP alone or GFP and miR340 together. Then, we
puriﬁed the GFP-positive cells using ﬂow cytometry and evaluated
miR340 expression in the infected cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
During the cell culture, we observed that miR340-overexpressing
cells became ﬂatter and larger than control cells (Fig. 2A). IHC
analysis and Western blot assays revealed that miR340-overexpressing hGICs partially decreased Nestin expression and lost the
expression of Sox2, but remained positive for GFAP, an astrocyte
marker (Fig. 2B–D). miR340-overexpressing hGICs ceased
proliferating during the ﬁrst 3 days of culture (Fig. 3A). The
BrdUrd-incorporation and cell-cycle analyses revealed that
miR340 overexpression signiﬁcantly arrested the cell cycle at the
G1–S transition, as indicated by a marked accumulation of cells in
the G1 peak and by a reduction of cells in the S phase (Fig. 3B and

C). In addition, we examined invasiveness and motility in the
miR340-overexpressing hGICs and conﬁrmed that miR340 signiﬁcantly inhibited both invasion and migration in these cells
(Fig. 3D and E). We further demonstrated that miR340 overexpression activated the expression of SA-b-gal, a marker of
cellular senescence, in hGICs (Fig. 3F). With the exception of
cellular senescence, similar results were observed in the miR340overexpressing human glioma cell lines. Taken together, these
data indicate that miR340 negatively regulates the proliferation
and invasiveness of both hGICs and glioma cell lines but induces
cellular senescence only in hGICs.
miR340 inhibits GIC-mediated tumorigenesis in vivo
Next, we investigated whether miR340 overexpression inhibits
GIC-mediated tumorigenesis in vivo. We transplanted either
miR340-overexpressing hGICs or their control hGICs into the
brains of immunodeﬁcient mice. The control hGICs without
miR340 overexpression continuously formed malignant gliomas
with high invasiveness and many mitotic cells with a histopathology closely resembling that of the original tumor, causing

1126 Cancer Res; 75(6) March 15, 2015

death in mice within 48 days (Fig. 4A, top, Fig. 4B–D). In contrast,
none of the mice injected with miR340-overexpressing hGICs
formed apparent tumors (Fig. 4A, bottom), and these mice
survived for more than 80 days (Fig. 4D). Histologic examination
3 days after transplantation of miR340-overexpressing hGICs
demonstrated that the injected tumor cells were positive for active
form of caspase-3 immunostaining, indicating that miR340
induced GIC apoptosis (Fig. 4E). In contrast, tumor formation
of miR340-overexpressing human glioma cell lines in mouse
brains was not completely suppressed, resulting in the death of
the mice although the mice survived 2 or 4 weeks longer than the
control (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). These ﬁndings indicate that miR340 is a strong suppressor of tumorigenesis in GICs,
although this antitumorigenic effect is less obvious in glioma cell
lines.
PLAT is a direct target of miR340
To identify functional targets of miR340, we compared the
gene expression proﬁles of miR340-overexpressing hGICs
with the proﬁles of their control GICs (Fig. 5A). We selected

candidate target genes that were signiﬁcantly upregulated or
downregulated in miR340-overexpressing hGICs and analyzed
these candidates using ConPath Navigator software, which is
based on the GenMAPP software program (www.genmapp.
org). These data revealed that miR340 regulates the genes
related to two signaling pathways. One is the cell-cycle pathway, which involves p21/Cip1 and cyclin A (17, 18). The
other is the cell adhesion/ECM remodeling pathway, which
includes PLAT and matrix metalloproteases (Supplementary
Fig. S4A and S4B; refs. 19, 20). Of the molecules that were
strongly regulated by miR340, we focused on PLAT because its
expression was signiﬁcantly decreased in miR340-expressing
hGICs (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In addition, the 30 UTRs of both
the mouse and human plat mRNAs contained potential miR340
target sequences (Fig. 5B). IHC analysis and Western blot assays
conﬁrmed that miR340 overexpression decreased PLAT expression in hGICs (Fig. 5C and D). Using a reporter vector encoding
the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene with the wild-type plat 30 UTR, we
demonstrated that miR340 overexpression inhibited luciferase
activity in hGICs, whereas a deletion in the predicted binding site
of miR340 in the 30 UTR of the plat gene abrogated the aforementioned inhibitory effect of miR340 (Fig. 5E). Taken together,
these data strongly indicate that PLAT is a novel direct target of
miR340 in hGICs. We conﬁrmed that PLAT was more highly
expressed in human glioblastomas than in normal brain tissues
at the level of both mRNA (Fig. 5F) and protein (Fig. 5G) and
that the tumor cells positive for PLAT immunostaining coexisted with those cells expressing CD15 (SSEA-1, hGIC marker;
ref. 21; Supplementary Fig. S5B).

PLAT knockdown inhibits GIC proliferation, invasion, and
migration in vitro and GIC tumor growth in vivo
We subsequently examined the functions of PLAT in hGICs.
PLAT knockdown using the plat-sh expression vector (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B) inhibited hGIC proliferation and invasion
in a manner similar to that induced by miR340 overexpression
(Fig. 6A–D). The inhibitory effects were fully recovered by introducing mutant PLAT, in which the shRNA target sequences were
deleted (Supplementary Fig. S7). Furthermore, miR340 transfection in hGICs overexpressing the PLAT gene that lacked the 30 UTR
recovered the inhibitory effects of miR340 on cell functions
(Supplementary Fig. S8). These results indicate that PLAT is a key
molecule that promotes malignancy of GIC by directly mediating
the functions of miR340 downregulation. In addition, transplanting PLAT-knockdown hGICs into mouse brains resulted in the
formation of tiny tumors localized at the injection site, but the
growth rate was extremely slow, indicating that PLAT promotes
GIC tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 6E).

Discussion
In the current study, we identiﬁed miR340 as a novel miRNA
whose expression was signiﬁcantly lower in both hGICs and
glioma cell lines than in NSCs. We also observed that miR340
suppressed not only GIC proliferation and invasion in vitro, but
also GIC-initiated tumor formation in mouse brains. These ﬁndings indicate that miR340 can act as a suppressor of malignant
functions in GICs, particularly gliomagenesis and extensive tumor
invasion. Furthermore, we determined that PLAT is the most

luciferase assays and PLAT-knockdown experiments with plat-sh,
which phenocopied the suppressive effects of miR340 overexpression in vitro and in vivo. In addition to PLAT, miR340 overexpression in hGICs decreased the expression of Sox2, c-Met, CD44, and
DNMT1, which are miR340 target genes (Supplementary Fig. S9).
c-Met and CD44 regulate cell invasion and migration (22, 23),

and Sox2 and CD44 play crucial roles in the maintenance of CSC
stemness (24). Although miR340 overexpression in hGICs did
not markedly decrease Nestin expression, Sox2 and CD44 expression signiﬁcantly decreased, indicating that miR340 might reduce
GIC stemness.
Transplanting miR340-overexpressing hGICs into mouse
brains did not result in tumor formation. However, the

partly due to tumor cell apoptosis. Recently, the inhibition of
Sox2, which is a stem cell marker, was demonstrated to reduce the
tumorigenic potential of human gastric cancer cells (25). In the
glioma cell lines, the expression levels of Sox2 were initially quite
low; therefore, Sox2 function was likely not highly affected by
miR340 in these cell lines. These ﬁndings suggest that the tumorigenic mechanisms differ between GICs and more differentiated
glioma cell lines.
Interestingly, the present study demonstrated that miR340
overexpression in hGICs promoted senescence in these cells,
whereas miR340 introduction into glioma cell lines did not
induce senescence (data not shown). Cellular senescence can
inhibit tumor formation by modulating the redox state in CSCs

and by regulating p27 in glioma cells (26, 27). In addition, GICs
derived from wild-type mice expressing the senescence-promoting factor esophageal cancer-related gene 4 (Ecrg4) caused significantly reduced tumor formation in mouse brains compared with
cells from Ecrg4-knockdown mice (28). We observed that miR340
overexpression in hGICs decreased DNA methyltransferase 1
(DNMT1) expression (Supplementary Fig. S9D); decreased
DNMT1 expression can promote cellular senescence (29). These
ﬁndings suggest that miR340-induced cellular senescence might
explain the reduced tumorigenic activity of miR340-overexpressing GICs.
Currently, many miRNAs that are down-regulated in GSCs have
been reported, including miR128, miR124, miR137, miR34a, and

miR451 (11), (30–32). The overexpression of these miRNAs
inhibits the proliferation and self-renewal, reduces the viability,
or induces the differentiation of GSCs but does not cause the
irreversible death of GSCs (31–33). Chan and colleagues demonstrated that miR138 acts as a prosurvival oncomiR in GSCs and
that functional inhibition of miR138 prevents not only tumorsphere formation in vitro, but also tumorigenesis in vivo by
inducing apoptosis and suppressing the proliferation of GSCs
(34). It has been recently reported that miR218 inhibits the selfrenewal of GSCs by targeting Bmi1 and regulates glioma cell
development by Wnt pathways (35). In addition, Wang and
colleagues reported that miR33a is highly expressed in GICs and
that antagonizing miR33a function in GICs reduces self-renewal
and tumor progression in mice by inhibiting the PKA and NOTCH
pathways, which promote GIC maintenance (36). Many tumor

cell functions, including a high proliferation rate, increased cell
motility, and suppressed apoptosis and senescence, may be tightly
linked during tumor development. Our ﬁndings indicate that
miR340 regulates the expression of several key target genes that
participate in cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and senescence, including PLAT, c-Met, CD44, Sox2, and DNMT1. Furthermore, p21 and ANXA2 genes, which have important roles in cell
proliferation and in cell invasion, respectively, are downstream of
PLAT. Both of these genes were also signiﬁcantly upregulated or
downregulated by miR340 overexpression in hGICs (Supplementary Fig. S9), indicating that PLAT plays central roles in cell
proliferation, invasion, and migration. The loss of miR340 as a
regulator controlling the expression of these genes in GICs promotes the development of these cells into malignant tumors and
advances tumor progression (Fig. 7).

Figure 7.
A schematic summary of the function
of miR340 and its target genes during
the tumorigenesis process in hGICs,
including cell cycle, invasiveness,
stemness, and senescence. PLAT is a
novel direct target gene suppressed
by miR340. Other target genes,
including c-Met, CD44, Sox2, and
DNMT1, are also downregulated by
miR340 in hGICs. Of the downstream
genes of PLAT, p21 is upregulated, and
ANXA2 is downregulated by miR340
overexpression in hGICs.

The National Cancer Institute's Repository for Molecular Brain
Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) database (https://caintegrator.
nci.nih.gov/rembrandt/; ref. 37) indicates that the prognosis of
glioma patients with increased PLAT levels is poorer than that of
patients with decreased PLAT levels (Supplementary Fig. S10).
These ﬁndings suggest that the introduction of miR340, which is
capable of directly suppressing PLAT expression, may be a useful
therapeutic tool for improving the prognosis of patients with
patients. Furthermore, future studies of the functional signiﬁcance
of miR340 target molecules, including PLAT, might provide a
greater understanding of the complex mechanisms of GBM development and progression.
