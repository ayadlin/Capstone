ABSTRACT
Cisplatin resistance remains a major problem in the treatment of lung cancer.
We have discovered that cisplatin resistant (CR) lung cancer cells, regardless of the
signaling pathway status, share the common parameter which is an increase in reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and undergo metabolic reprogramming. CR cells were no longer
addicted to the glycolytic pathway, but rather relied on oxidative metabolism. They
took up twice as much glutamine and were highly sensitive to glutamine deprivation.
Glutamine is hydrolyzed to glutamate for glutathione synthesis, an essential factor to
abrogate high ROS via xCT antiporter. Thus, blocking glutamate flux using riluzole (an
amyotropic lateral sclerosis approved drug) can selectively kill CR cells in vitro and
in vivo. However, we discovered here that glutathione suppression is not the primary
pathway in eradicating the CR cells. Riluzole can lead to further decrease in NAD+
(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) expressions
which in turn further heightened oxidative stress in CR cells. LDHA knocked-down
cells became hypersensitive to riluzole treatments and possessed increased levels of
ROS. Addition of NAD+ re-stabilized LDHA and reversed riluzole induced cell death.
Thus far, no drugs are available which could overcome cisplatin resistance or kill
cisplatin resistant cells. CR cells possess high levels of ROS and undergo metabolic
reprogramming. These metabolic adaptations can be exploited and targeted by riluzole.
Riluzole may serve as a dual-targeting agent by suppression LDHA and blocking xCT
antiporter. Repurposing of riluzole should be considered for future treatment of
cisplatin resistant lung cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

We have discovered that elevated reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are found in all cisplatin resistant (CR) cell lines
including those derived from patients who failed cisplatin.
Further increasing ROS using a ROS inducing agent can
selectively kill CR cells [1]. We also have presented the
evidence that decreased thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) expression

Drug resistance is a major obstacle to cancer
chemotherapy. Despite early positive response to platinumbased chemotherapy, the majority of small-cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer (SCLC & NSCLC) develop resistance.

in CR lung cancer cells is one important mediator of ROS
and reprograms lung cancer cells to become more reliant
on oxidative metabolism (OXMET) [1]. Thus, unlike the
parental cells or cells from chemo-naïve patients, these
resistant cells are not utilizing glycolysis as their main source
of energy. It is known that tumor cells metabolize glucose
to lactate even when oxygen is abundant (Warburg effect)
[2–5]. This is not due to defective mitochondrial respiration
but rather due to up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes and
glucose transporters [6–8]. In fact, increased glucose uptake
is one of the hallmarks for malignant transformation [9, 10].
While decreased TRX1 may be a primary factor
which contributes to increasing ROS and metabolic
switch in CR cells, there are other factors involved since
restoration of TRX1 cannot completely reverse cisplatin
resistance. In this manuscript, we study other mechanisms
involved and methods to circumvent this form of resistance.
We have found that CR cells expressed significantly lower
levels of hexokinase-2 (HK2) and lactic dehydrogenase-A
(LDHA) which further indicated that CR cells do not
depend primarily on glycolysis. Moreover, studies have
shown that reduction in LDHA expression in cancer
cells either by genetic knock down (shRNA) or inhibitor
(FX11) resulted in the shift to oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) and increased intracellular ROS [11, 12]. These
studies have elucidated that LDHA mediated inhibition
of mitochondria respiration and enhanced glycolysis in
cancer cells, thus LDHA could potentially be considered
as a therapeutic target. Since our previous data indicated
that CR cells have very low lactic acid production, we plan
to determine the role of LDHA and its important co-factor
NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) in CR cells.
Our findings also revealed that unlike parental cells,
CR cells were not sensitive to glucose withdrawal, but were
exclusively sensitive to glutamine deprivation which further
supported our hypothesis that CR cell rely on OXMET as their
main energy source. Thus, it is possible that interfering with
glutamine and glutamate flux can be used to target CR cells.
It is known that riluzole, an FDA-approved orally available
drug for the treatment of amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
[13], interferes with glutamate flux and blocks metabotropic
glutamate receptors (GRM) signaling. This drug was shown
to block proliferation of melanoma cell lines expressing GRM
in vitro and in vivo while inhibition with a dominant negative
construct resulted in apoptosis [14]. A phase-0 trial of riluzole
in melanoma also showed good response [15].
In this study, we exploited ROS and metabolic
alterations, as well as explored the possible antitumor
effect of riluzole in CR cells.

lowered intracellular TRX1, and contributed to higher
ROS in cisplatin resistant (CR) tumors (Supplementary
Figure 1). Consequently, alterations in metabolic pathway
were found in CR cells. To verify this, we have assayed
the key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. Our results
showed that all CR cells expressed lower levels of HK2
and LDHA proteins (Figure 1A). Using Seahorse XFe24
Extracellular flux analyzers, we assayed for lactate
production in response to adding glucose, oligomycin,
and 2DG (Figure 1B, left panel), our results indicated
that CR produced significantly less lactate (Figure 1B,
right panel). To further support that CR cells are less
addicted to glucose, we demonstrated that CR took up less
fluorescent glucose analog (2-NBD) by flow cytometry
when compared to parental cell counterparts. All CR cells’
peaks were shifted to the left as depicted in Figure 1C. As a
result, CR cells were more resistant to glycolytic inhibitor,
2-deoxy-glucose (2DG), with an average of 2–5 fold
higher under normoxia (Figure 1D). To further confirm
that CR cells were less capable of utilizing glycolysis,
we performed growth inhibitory assay under the hypoxic
condition (0.5%O2). Under this condition, tumor cells
which utilized glycolysis survived; however, CR cells
could not proliferate nor survive under this condition and
became more sensitive to glycolytic inhibitor (Figure 1D).
Taken together, our findings strongly suggested that CR
cells were no longer addicted to glucose.

Higher mitochondrial activities were found in
CR cells
Since CR cells were less addicted to glycolytic
pathway, they must utilize mitochondria for biogenesis to
catabolize alternative carbon skeleton source. To confirm
this, we first compared oxygen consumption using Seahorse
flux analyzer. In response to adding glucose, oligomycin,
FCCP, and rotenone (Figure 2A left panel.), CR cells
consumed significantly higher rates of oxygen (Figure 2A
right panel), and thus had higher levels of ATP production
when compared to their parental cells counterparts
(Supplementary Figure 2, p < 0.01). CR cells also have
increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as
detected by TMRE (Figure 2B). To determine whether
active mitochondria may lead to increased mitochondriaROS production, we assayed for ROS levels in the cell
line pairs using MitoSOX. As shown in Figure 2C, all
CR cell lines tested indeed have higher basal levels of
mitochondria-ROS. Together, our data suggested that CR
cells utilized more OXPHOS and conceivably possessed
higher mitochondria per cell when compared to their
parental cell counterparts. To further verify this, we assessed
mitochondrial alterations through the transmission electron
microscope (TEM). CR cells possessed significantly higher
number of mitochondria per total cell area when compared
with parental (p = 0.0006) (Figure 2D). Overall, our data
clearly indicated that CR cells utilized OXMET and do not
depend primarily on glycolysis.

Glutamine and glutamate flux greatly impact cell
viable in CR cells

leads to cell death. To investigate this possibility, we studied
the possible antitumor activity of the FDA approved drug
(riluzole) which is a potent inhibitor of glutamate secretion
[14, 16, 17]. Riluzole interferes with system xCT/cystine/
glutamate pump which results in decreasing glutathione
(GSH) levels inside the cells (see Figure Diagram). It has
been shown that CD44 has a role in cellular response to
oxidative stress [18, 19]. Here, we showed that CR cells,
which possess higher basal levels of ROS, expressed higher
levels of xCT and CD44 proteins (Figure 4A). Importantly,
CR cells were very sensitive to riluzole treatment with
significant lower ID50 dosage when compared to parental
cell counterparts (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 4A;
p < 0.03). ROS levels were increased significantly in
CR cells after riluzole treatment (Figure 4C; P < 0.02).
Simultaneously, total GSH concentrations were decreased
within 24 h and further reduced at 48 h only in CR cells
after treatment (Figure 4D). Since riluzole is known to
inhibits glutamate efflux [20, 21], we assayed for glutamate
release before and after riluzole treatment. Riluzole indeed
was able to inhibit glutamate release in both parental and
more significantly in CR cells (Figure 4E; p < 0.05).
To determine whether cell death is associated with
increased ROS, we exposed cells to N-acetyl-cysteine
(NAC) in combination with riluzole. NAC is a wellknown antioxidant and GSH precursor. Pretreatment with
2 mM of NAC significantly suppressed ROS and reversed
riluzole cytotoxicity (Figure 4F; P < 0.02 and 4G; p < 0.05
respectively). We noted that 72 h combination treatment
only partially suppressed ROS and reduced cell death. This
may due to the short half-life of NAC activity. As a proof
of concept, we treated Rho 0 (mitochondrial compromise
cell) with riluzole. As expected, Rho 0 cells were very
resistant to riluzole (Supplementary Figure 4B). Overall,
these findings further support that riluzole induced CR
cells death through mitochondria ROS.
In order to determine the functional relevance of
xCT/cystine/glutamate anti-port pump, we treated CR cells
with sulfasalazine (SSZ), a known inhibitor of system xcpump [22, 23]. This drug also has been used in combination
with cisplatin in colon cancer [24]. However, in our system,
CR cells were not sensitive to SSZ when compared to
parental counterparts (Supplementary Figure 4C). ROS
accumulations were observed in CR cells only when these
CR cells were treated with supra-pharmacological dosage
which cannot be achieved in vivo. Hence, our data suggested
that cystine/glutamate anti-port is not the only mechanism
involved. Riluzole must also affects other systems which
together further amplified oxidative stress in CR cells.
Nonetheless, we showed here that CR cells required
glutamine for OXMET and that glutamine-glutamate flux
also played an important role in countering excessive ROS
in these cells. Disrupting cystine/glutamate transporter
system with riluzole resulted in higher intracellular ROS
levels, which contributed to one of the mechanisms in
killing CR cells.

To determine that CR cells indeed rely more on
OXMET and not glucose, we investigated whether
glutaminolysis is essential for CR cells to survive. We first
compared cell viability of parental vs. CR cells in glutaminefree media. As shown in Figure 3A, glutamine withdrawals
were able to inhibit growth and have a detrimental effect
on all CR cell lines. The switch of glutamine from being a
nonessential amino acid to an essential amino acid in CR
cells was not an artifact of in vitro culture since glutamine
deprivation only had the profound effect toward CR cells,
but not in parental cells.
Moreover, CR cells took up higher amounts of
glutamine especially in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) which took up twice as much L-[G-3H]
glutamine when compared to its parental counterpart
(Figure 3B). Using qRTPCR to assay glutaminase (GLS),
an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to
glutamate, we have found that the levels were higher in
NSCLC but not in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells
that were resistant to cisplatin (Figure 3C). We then
investigated whether there were any differential sensitivity
to GLS inhibitor (BPTES) seen in these CR cells compared
to parental cells. Interestingly, our data showed that
CR cells were slightly but not significantly sensitive to
BPTES (Supplementary Figure 3). We then assayed for
intracellular glutamate levels using amino acid analyzer
and found that CR cells do not possess higher levels of
glutamate inside the cells (Figure 3D). Conversely, we
discovered that glutamate secretions were higher in CR
cells’ media and much higher in cisplatin resistant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC-CR) compared to cisplatin
resistant small cell lung cancer (SCLC-CR) (Figure 3E).
Here, we reported the dynamics of glutamine and
glutamate flux in CR cells. Higher glutamine uptake rates
in CR cells also lead to increased levels of glutamate
release which may possibly be metabolically exploited.
However, in SCLC, it appeared that the flux of glutamine
uptake as well as glutamate release were not significant
when compared to NSCLC. Only marginally increased
in glutamine/glutamate were observed. In addition, the
levels of glutaminase levels were also lower in SCLCCR compared to parental cells. Overall, it appeared that
the glutamine/glutamate axis may not be a major amino
acids utilizing source in SCLC. We therefore will focus on
NSCLC cells herein.

Exploiting glutamate efflux in cisplatin resistant
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC-CR) cells
using riluzole
Since our data suggest that glutamine/glutamate was
the major source of energy in NSCLC-CR, disrupting this
pathway may result in metabolic catastrophe which in turn

Treatment with riluzole results in decreasing
LDHA expression

depend on glutamine but possessed lower level of LDHA
with riluzole. Indeed, SR2 were also sensitive to riluzole
treatment (Supplementary Figure 4A). Here, our data
indicated that LDHA suppression may be the main target
of riluzole induced cell death in CR cells.

It has been shown that cells with higher ROS have
lower LDHA expression [11]. Whether LDHA plays
a key role in riluzole sensitivity seen in CR cells is not
known, we then investigated this possibility by inhibiting
LDHA expression in parental cell lines S and H460 using
siRNA (Figure 5A). Lactate production was decreased in
knockdown cells as anticipated and was further attenuated
upon riluzole treatment when compared with scrambled
control (Figure 5B). Higher basal levels of H2O2 were
obtained from SsiLDHA and H460siLDHA and increased levels
in ROS	 were observed when treated with riluzole
(Figure 5C). Likewise, reduction of LDHA expression by
siRNA in parental cells also resulted in increased oxygen
consumption and was further augmented when exposed
to riluzole (Supplementary Figure 5). We then evaluated
the viability of these cells under riluzole treatment. Both
siLDHA clones were sensitive to riluzole, particularly
SsiLDHA which showed 4-fold higher sensitivity (Figure 5D).
Importantly, treatment with riluzole also led to further
decrease in LDHA expression at both protein (Figure
5E) and mRNA levels (Figure 5F). To further support
this notion, we treated SR2 cells which do not mainly

Riluzole suppresses NAD+ and decreases LDHA
levels
Since NAD+ is a co-factor of LDHA, we assayed
for NAD+ levels in parental vs. CR cells to further
determine the important relationship between NAD+
levels and LDHA expression. As depicted in Figure 6A,
SC cell line which expressed lower levels of LDHA also
possessed significantly lower levels of intracellular NAD+.
However, we also noted that the NAD+ levels in H460CR
is only slight lower than H460. This is most likely due
to the fact that the NAD+ levels were already low in
parental cells (H460). Nevertheless, our data consistently
indicated that lower NAD+ levels were correlated with
riluzole sensitivity. Both SC and H460CR NAD+ levels
were further suppressed upon riluzole treatment and
increased riluzole concentrations resulted in greater
suppression of NAD+ levels. To assess that NAD+ played
a role in protecting cell against riluzole, we treated CR

results in reducing glutathione (GSH) levels inside the cells. (HK2: hexokinase-2, LDHA: lactate dehydrogenase-A, GLS: glutaminase,

cells in combination with 200 µM NAD+. The addition
of supplemental NAD+ reversed riluzole cytotoxicity
almost completely (Figure 6B). We then assayed for
LDHA expression to further determine the relationship
between NAD+ and LDHA after riluzole treatment.

LDHA expression was significantly decreased upon
riluzole treatments, but can be reversed by addition of
NAD+ (Figure 6C). Reduced ROS accumulations were
also observed with combination treatments of NAD+ with
riluzole (Figure 6D).

To further explore why the levels of NAD+
correlated with LDHA and riluzole sensitivity, we assayed
for NMNAT2 (nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl
transferase-2), a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the
production of NAD+ from nicotinamide mononucleotide
(NMN). NMNAT2 represents the final step in the
biosynthesis of NAD+ in both de novo and salvage
pathways. Consistent with LDHA expressions, CR

cells expressed significantly lower levels of NMNAT2
(Figure 6E). It is also evident that NMNAT2 expressions
were increased upon riluzole treatment in both parental
and CR cells to compensate for NAD+ reduction.
Nevertheless, increased NMNAT2 is not sufficient to
escalate enough NAD+ biogenesis to overcome the loss
of LDHA and NAD+. Interestingly, there were reports
that suggested NAD+ can stimulate PKA activity and

to their parental counterparts and normal cells. One of the
major contributory factors to higher ROS is the reduction
in thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) levels due to increased secretion
[1]. The increased secretion can be detected in the media
and in the serum from mice carrying CR xenograft. Studies
have shown that over-expression of TRX1 increased HIF1α
while transfection of non-functional TRX1 decreased
HIF1α [29]. Since HIF1α also regulates enzymes involved
in the glycolytic pathway, it is possible that decreased
TRX1 and HIF1α protein expressions [1] found in CR cells
also have a negative impact on glucose metabolism.
Although increased glucose metabolism in cancer
cell has been hypothesized as the main carbon skeleton
source of energy, we and other [30] have shown that CR
cells are no longer addicted to the glycolytic pathway,
but rather are dependent on amino acids for energy and
biosynthesis. Key glycolytic enzymes HK2 and LDHA,
as well as lactate production were decreased in all CR
cell lines tested which corresponded to the resistance to
glycolytic inhibitor, 2DG. We have also shown previously
that SCLC-CR cells utilized fatty acids as their main
energy source as evident by increased acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthesis (FASN), the
two key enzymes involved in the fatty acid synthesis.
These cell lines also were hypersensitive to ACC and
FASN inhibitors (TOFA and C75, respectively). Thus,
in contrast to NSCLC-CR cells which rely more on the
glutamine/glutamate metabolism pathway, SCLC-CR did
not depend primarily on glutamine/glutamate axis.
Glutamine and glutamate flux have great impact on
NSCLC-CR cells viability as shown here in this study. CR
cells take up significantly greater amounts of glutamine
and secreted higher levels of glutamate when compared to
parental counterparts. There are reports which have shown
that glutamine imported into cells is not totally utilized for
anabolic metabolism [31]. Rather, a portion of glutamine/
glutamate is shuttled out of the cell in exchange for
amino acids that directly activate mTOR [32, 33]. Other
amino acids such as arginine which can be converted to
glutamate also were recently reported to play an important
role in regulating mTOR activity [34]. Interestingly, we
have previously reported that mTOR activities were higher
in all CR cells and they were sensitive to mTOR inhibitors
rapamycin or temsirolimus [35]. Hence, the uptake and
export of glutamine/glutamate serves both as signal to
mTOR and as a source of amino acids to promote protein
translation and cell survival.
Increased glutamate efflux is also the important
process for cells to generate glutathione (GSH) to cope
with high intracellular ROS levels. This process is carried
out through system xc-, a cystine-glutamate exchange
transporter composed of xCT subunit [36]. xCT is a
component of a plasma membrane transporter that mediates
the cellular uptake of extracellular cystine in exchange
for intracellular glutamate and plays a key role in GSH
synthesis. The activity of xCT-mediated cystine uptake in

consequently stabilize LDHA mRNA [25, 26]. Thus, these
works further supported our findings that decreased NAD+
levels by riluzole can impact LDHA protein integrity. This
is an important issue that needs to be addressed. We plan to
investigate these complex relationships in the future.

GRMs (metabotropic glutamate receptors) are
not involved in antitumor activity of riluzole
Since riluzole inhibits glutamate efflux [20, 21], and
hence may affect metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM)
and its signaling pathway as one of the mechanisms
in inhibiting cell growth. To further determine the
relationship between glutamate signaling and riluzole
sensitivities, we assayed for GRM1 expressions. The levels
of GRM1 did not correlate with riluzole cytotoxicity. We
then assayed for other variants of glutamate receptors
(GRM1 to GRAM5) at the mRNA levels. Again, we
found no correlation between GRM expressions with
riluzole sensitivity (Supplementary Figure 6). Using flow
cytometry to quantify functional GRM1 that was localized
at the cell surface also revealed no correlation. Thus, our
data did not support that GRM signaling participates in
riluzole cytotoxicity seen in CR cell. This is also consistent
with a recent report that silencing and overexpression of
GRMS had no effect on cell sensitivity to riluzole [27].

Antitumor activity of riluzole in CR cells also
seen in vivo model
To address that antitumor activity of riluzole which
we observed in vitro can be seen in vivo, we tested riluzole
in 2 pairs of CR lung cancer xenograft models using S vs.
SC and H460 vs. H460CR. Tumors were subcutaneously
injected and were allowed to grow to about 100 mm2 before
treatment with saline or 7.5 mg/kg riluzole (once a day).
Riluzole induced a significant reduction in tumor size in
CR xenografts with greatest reduction in SC (Figure 7A).
However, noticeable tumor size reductions were also seen
in H460 but not in S xenograft model. These differences
may be due to the fact that H460 harbored KRAS mutation
and possess higher basal level of ROS while S which was
a wild type and produced less ROS. These findings will
need further investigation. H460 also possessed lower
LDHA when compared to S cells, and importantly, lowered
LDHA expression was observed in tumor tissue from SC
and H460R xenograft treated with riluzole (Figure 7B).
Together, our data suggested that riluzole was effective as
a novel therapeutic modality for CR cells.

DISCUSSION
Metabolic alterations are one of the hallmarks of
cancer, controlling tumor progression and metastasis
[5, 28]. Our previous work has shown that all CR lung cell
lines possess higher basal levels of ROS when compared

cancer cells is known to be highly associated with tumor
growth and chemo-resistance [36, 37]. CD44 together
with xCT contributed to ROS defense by promoting the
synthesis of reduced GSH [18, 19]. We showed here that
higher basal levels of ROS found in all CR cells possessed
higher expressions of xCT and CD44 when compared to

parental counterparts. Thus, we suggested that glutamine
is important to CR cell not only for OXMET, but also
for maintaining oxidative balance. More importantly,
treatment of riluzole disrupted the oxidative defense
in CR cells by significantly reducing glutamate release
which in turn suppressed GSH levels and is one of the

extracted from these cells were reverse-transcribed and subsequently used as template for real-time quantitative PCR. Actin was used as
internal control. The results shown in the graph were calculated with the ΔΔCt method by setting the LDHA mRNA level of control cells
(SC or H460CR) as 1. (D) ROS production were increased with riluzole treatment, but suppressed when exposed to NAD+ (72 h) (*p < 0.02).
(E) Relative mRNA levels of NMNAT2; NMNAT2 were significantly decreased in CR cells (72 h) (*p < 0.001). Note that H460 which do
not have high LDHA levels also expressed significantly low level of NMNAT2 (**p < 0.004). Total RNAs extracted from these cells were
reverse-transcribed and subsequently used as template for real-time quantitative PCR. Actin was used as internal control. The results shown
in the graph were calculated with the ΔΔCt method by setting the NMNAT2 mRNA level of control cells (LL24) as 1.

mechanisms resulting in higher ROS accumulation (see
Figure Diagram). However, we were intrigued by the
fact that SSZ, an inhibitor of system xc- pump, had very
minimal effect on CR cells. Thus, other mechanisms must
be involved in ROS generation by riluzole.

Decreased LDHA expressions found in CR cells
could also contribute to higher basal levels of ROS since
less lactate production may redirect more pyruvate into
mitochondria. It is noteworthy that pyruvate can also be
generated by mitochondria via malic enzyme. Thus, with

low LDHA activity, pyruvate can be shuttle back into the
mitochondria to replenish the TCA cycle. Heightened
mitochondrial activity has long been associated with
increasing ROS production. In fact, the largest contributor
to cellular ROS is the mitochondria. In addition, NAD+
which is a crucial co-enzyme of all organisms’ redox
system can be categorized as “metabolic currency”. We
presented the evidence that CR cells already operated at a
very low metabolic currency rate. A key enzyme in NAD+
biogenesis, NMNAT2, was also significantly reduced in
CR cells. Thus, further suppression in NAD+ will increase
the deficit in the balance and consequently will lead to
metabolic collapse. This is consistent with other reports
which showed that certain cancer cells already have
very low NAD+/NADH ration [38] and change in NAD+
correlates better with tumor growth than change in ATP
[39]. Importantly, we found that riluzole can increase ROS
by disrupting LDHA expression through suppression of
NAD+. Reconstituted NAD+ re-stabilized LDHA which
resulted in lowering intracellular ROS, and reversal of
riluzole cytotoxicity. Note that NAD+ is a key factor for
maintaining redox balance as it serves as a precursor to
NADPH. Suppression of NAD+ most likely represents a
new mechanism on how riluzole increased ROS levels in
CR cells besides blocking xCT pump. Furthermore, NAD+
can stimulate PKA activity and in turn stabilize LDHA
mRNA [25, 26]. Whether riluzole can effect PKA directly
is not known, we plan to investigate this in the future.
Riluzole, an amino acid channel blocker, is taken
orally and has generally been well tolerated by patients.
Increasing ROS through riluzole pushes CR cells beyond
their tolerance limit, which ultimately leads to cell death.
In fact, recent report has shown that riluzole can increase
ROS in tumor cells which further supports our findings
[40]. Targeting cancer cells by ROS mediated mechanisms
is an effective strategy to treat cancer cells that possess
unique redox mechanisms. Consequently, it is possible
to consider that riluzole may have dual-targeting action.
Riluzole heightens ROS in CR cells by simultaneously
suppressing LDHA and blocking xCT anti-port system.
Thus, this could explain why SSZ alone, which only
targets xCT, has a minimal effect in CR cells.
Moreover, it is noteworthy that one mechanism by
which riluzole might be mediating its effect on lung cancer
is by blocking ion channels, specifically tetrodotoxin–
sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs)
[41, 42]. It is well established that riluzole blocks the
functions of these channels in neurons [41]. VGSCs
have been shown to be expressed in a range of cell types
including lung cancer cells [43]. However, the action of
riluzole on these receptors, as well as the metabotropic
receptors, has been controversial. In fact, there is no report
on riluzole binding site to any of those receptors [44, 45].
In conclusion, we discovered that cisplatin resistant
cells possess high levels of ROS and undergo metabolic
reprogramming. These alterations can be exploited
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to kill CR cells by using riluzole. Riluzole treatment
further increased ROS by multiple mechanisms. The
key mechanism we found is that riluzole suppresses
LDHA and NAD+ levels. Riluzole also blocks cystine/
glutamate pump. Together, these two mechanisms work
in conjunction to heighten ROS levels and lead to cell
death in CR cells. Repurpose of riluzole as an antitumor
agent against cisplatin resistance in lung cancer patients is
possible and should be explored.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Two pairs of cisplatin resistant from SCLC (SCLC1/
SR2 and H69/H69CR) and two pairs from NSCLC
(H460/H460CR and S/SC) were used in this study. The
characteristics of SCLC1/SR2 as well as S/SC have been
previously characterized [35, 46–48]. H69, H460, and
LL24 were purchased from ATCC. Their cisplatin resistant
variants were established in our laboratory using previously
published method [35, 47]. Note: SR2 exhibits 20 fold
resistance, SC exhibits 7-fold resistance, while H69CR
and H460CR exhibits 10-fold resistance to cisplatin. LL24
is normal lung fibroblast. Supplementary Table 1 showed
the ID50 values for the sensitive and resistant cell lines.
Riluzole was purchased from SelleckChem. NAC and
NAD+ were purchased from Sigma.

Growth inhibition and cytotoxicity assay
Cells were seeded in 24-well dishes and treated
with various concentrations of riluzole. The procedure
was described previously [46, 49]. Briefly, the culture
media as well as the trypsinized cells were collected and
this mixture was centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min. The
supernatant was discarded, and resuspended in 1 mL of
Hank’s buffer and assayed for live cells and death cells
using trypan blue exclusion method.

Western blot analysis
Cells were seeded at 1 × 105/ml onto 100 mm dishes,
treated, collected, lysed and immunoblotted with indicated
antibody. Detail procedure was described in our previous
publications [46, 49]. Briefly, cell lysis was completed by
sonication and the total protein was separated on an SDSPAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore)
and immunoblotted with HK2, LDHA (Cell Signaling),
xCT (BD Bioscience), CD44 (Santa Cruz), and Actin
(Sigma). Bands were measured using a molecular imager
Chemidoc system with Quality One software (Bio-Rad).

Assay of Intracellular ROS/H2O2
As previously described [50], cells were collected and
intracellular H2O2 was measured by incubating with either
49287

Oncotarget

10 µM of acetyl-penta-fluorobenzenesulfonyl fluorescein
(APFB) (EMD) or 5 uM of MitoSOX (Invitrogen) at 37°C
for 30 min in the dark. Then the cells were washed once
with PBS and centrifuged to remove impermeable reagents.
Cells were resuspended in 500 µL of PBS and analyzed in a
fluorimeter, FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech (excitation
at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm).

was (length × width2)/2. Tumor growth inhibition was
calculated as median of tumor volume in treatment group
to that in control group (T/C) ratio. NCI standard of the
T/C ratio is < 42% which indicates significant tumor
growth inhibition.

RNA interference experiments

Cancer cell cultures were acquired and immediately
fixed in neutral buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde at room
temperature (25oC). The specimens were post-fixed in 1%
osmium tetroxide (OsO4) for 10 minutes, dehydrated using
a graded ethanol series, enbloch stained with 2% uranyl
acetate in 50% ethanol for 30 minutes, and embedded
in Spurr’s epoxy resin. Semi-thin (1 μm) and ultra-thin
(< 90 nm) sections were cut using a Diatome 3 mm
diamond knife on the Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome.
Semi-thin sections were stained with toluidine blue and
examined using an Olympus BX60 light microscope with
an attached Olympus DP71 digital camera. All ultra-thin
sections were stained using lead citrate to be viewed under
TEM on a Jeol 1400 EM at 80 kV. Images for publication
were compiled into using Photoshop CS5 software.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

8 × 105 cells were seeded in a 60 mm petri dish
and incubated for 24 h. INTERFERinTM transfection
reagent (Polyplus) was then used to transfect 1 nM of
LDHA directed SMARTpool® siRNA (NM_005566) or
siCONTROL® (5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-3′)
(Dharmacon). Cells were incubated in the presence of
transfection medium for 24 h as previously described [49].

Qualitative realtime PCR
qRTPCR was carried out as previously described
[51]. Briefly, 1ug of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis.
The primers for qRT-PCR are designed with Perlprimer
for SYBR Green fluorophore. 40 cycle amplification was
used. The data were analyzed with CFX manager software
from Bio-Rad. To calculate the relative mRNA level, we
used the ΔΔCt method. The level of mRNA was corrected
with that of actin.

Assay of mitochondrial membrane potential and
activity (MMP)
Cells were collected and membrane potentials
were measured by incubating with 50 nM of
tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) (Invitrogen) at
37°C for 30 min in the dark. Then the cells were washed
once with PBS and centrifuged to remove impermeable
reagents. Cells were resuspended in 500 µL of PBS and
analyzed in FLUOstar OPTIMA (excitation at 544 nm and
emission at 590 nm).

Real time assay of oxygen consumption and
lactate production
Simultaneous multi-parameter metabolic analysis
of cell populations in culture was performed in the
Seahorse XFe24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse
Bioscience) as described by Wu et al. [52]. All cell lines
were cultured in growth medium for 24 h in plate before
real-time metabolic analysis. At the start of the assay,
growth medium was removed and replaced with assay
medium. Basal OCR (oxygen consumption rate) and
ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) of the cells were
measured. After XF assay, cells were harvested by trypsinEDTA treatment and counted. The number of cells per
well were used to normalize OCR and ECAR.

Glutamine uptake
Cells were seeded and cultured for 24 h in complete
RPMI media. The medium was then replaced with fresh
“hot” (5µCi L-[G-3H] glutamine , PerkinElmer) glutamine
free and serum free RPMI. Next, the hot medium was
removed, cells were washed three times with fresh,
RPMI serum-free with glutamine medium “cold”, and
the cells were lysed with 0.5 mL of 1 N NaOH, collected
in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and gently vortexed. A 0.25
mL sample was used for protein analysis by Micro BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Radioactivity from
the remaining sample was counted using a PerkinElmer
Tri-Carb 2810TR liquid scintillation spectrometer with
QuantaSmart. Radioactivity was measured as counts per
minute (CPM) and normalized to protein.

Animal studies
The procedures and protocol of mice were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Miami VA medical center (Animal Welfare
Assurance Number: A3739-01). Female athymic nudeFoxn1nu mice (6–8 weeks, Harlan Laboratories) were
inoculated subcutaneously with 1 × 106 cells prepared
in physiologic buffered saline (PBS). When the tumor
volumes reached 100 mm3, the treatment group received
IP injection of riluzole (7.5 mg/kg) daily, and control
group was saline only. The formula of tumor volume
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Glutamate release
The amount of glutamate that was transported
out of the cells was measured using the Amplex®-Red
49288

Oncotarget

Glutamic Acid/Glutamate Oxidase assay kit (Molecular
Probes/Invitrogen). The assay is based on the oxidation
of glutamate by glutamate oxidase, producing alphaketoglutarate, NH3, and H2O2. The H2O2 reacts with the
Amplex®-Red reagent to produce the fluorescent product,
risorufin. A standard curve from 0 to 20 μM was prepared
using the kit’s glutamate stock. The positive control was
10 μM H2O2 in reaction buffer. Cells were seeded in
glutamine/glutamate free media and 50µL of media were
then collected. 50 μL of Amplex®-Red working solution
was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at
37°C for 30 min to 1 h. Fluorescence was detected at
590 nm using the OPTIMA plate reader. Concentrations
of L-glutamate were calculated from the standard curve.

For IHC staining, the tumor tissue slides were hybridized
with LDHA antibody (Cell Singling Technology, 1:400)
at 4°C overnight. Thereafter, the slides were stained with
LSAB™2 Kits (DAKO) and hematoxylin (DAKO) and
visualized by a light microscope (Olympus).

Amino acid analyzer
Free amino acids (30–40 in the complete panel) in
physiological fluids were analyzed by Biochrom 30 amino
acids analyzer using ion exchange chromatography. Values
were reported compared to control normal ranges. Ion
exchange chromatography is based on analytical separation
with ion-exchange column and buffers of increasing pH
and ionic strength. The chromatographically separated
amino acids were detected after post-column derivatization
with Ninhydrin and colorimetric intensity recorded at
wavelength of 570 nm and 440 nm. Concentration of
amino acid was calculated from comparing peak area of
a particular amino acid to peak area of internal standardAEC of known concentration and then multiply by its
specific response factor from calibration. Proline and
hydroxyl-proline were calculated from 440 nm, rest of
AAs is from 570 nm.

Assay of glutathione (GSH)
A GSH assay kit (Cayman Chemical) was used
to measure total cellular glutathione. Cells were seeded
at 4 × 105 and cell lysate was prepared by sonication
and deproteination using the conditions recommended
by the manufacturer. Total GSH was detected by
measuring the product of glutathionylated DTNB by UV
spectrophotometer at 405 nm. The cellular GSH contents
were calculated using the standard curve generated in
parallel experiments.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed from three
separate measurements using the two-tailed t-test and the
results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. A
p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant. As for TEM, mitochondrial area per cell
area ratios between H460 and H460R were statistically
analyzed using difference of means function from the
InStat program. Comparisons were made using a twotailed Paired t-test. The level of statistical for comparison
was set at p = 0.05.

Assay of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+)
A NAD/NADH assay kit (Cayman Chemical) was
used to measure total cellular NAD+ concentration. Cell
were seeded in 96-well at 1x104 and grow overnight.
Different dosages of riluzole were added on the following
day for 1 h incubation period. Total NAD+ was detected at
450 nm according to manufacture instruction.

Glucose uptake

glucose analogue was used. Cells were collected and
incubated with 2-NBD glucose (Life Technologies) at
12.5 μg/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were
then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 500 µL
of PBS and analyzed in C6 Accuri Flow (excitation at
544 nm and emission at 590 nm).
