ABSTRACT
Epidemiologic studies implicate vitamin D status as a factor that influences
growth of EGFR mutant lung cancers. However, laboratory based evidence of the
biological effect of vitamin D in this disease is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we
determined vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in human lung tumors using a tissue
microarray constructed of lung cancer cases from never-smokers (where EGFR gene
mutations are prevalent). Nuclear VDR was detected in 19/19 EGFR mutant tumors.
Expression tended to be higher in tumors with EGFR exon 19 deletions than those
with EGFR L858R mutations. To study anti-proliferative activity and signaling, EGFR
mutant lung cancer cells were treated with the circulating metabolite of vitamin D,
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3). 25D3 inhibited clonogenic growth in a dose-dependent
manner. CYP27B1 encodes the 1α-hydroxylase (1αOHase) that converts 25D3 to the
active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3). Studies employing VDR siRNA,
CYP27B1 zinc finger nucleases, and pharmacologic inhibitors of the vitamin D pathway
indicate that 25D3 regulates gene expression in a VDR-dependent manner but does
not strictly require 1αOHase-mediated conversion of 25D3 to 1,25D3. To determine
the effects of modulating serum 25D3 levels on growth of EGFR mutant lung tumor
xenografts, mice were fed diets containing 100 or 10,000 IU vitamin D3/kg. High
dietary vitamin D3 intake resulted in elevated serum 25D3 and significant inhibition
of tumor growth. No toxic effects of supplementation were observed. These results
identify EGFR mutant lung cancer as a vitamin D-responsive disease and diet-derived
25D3 as a direct VDR agonist and therapeutic agent.

Large scale sequencing efforts demonstrate that EGFR
mutations are most frequently detected among lung
cancer patients with adenocarcinoma histology, neversmoker status, East Asian ethnicity, and female sex [4]. It
is largely unknown why certain demographic populations
are at elevated risk for development of EGFR mutant
lung cancer, but prior pulmonary tuberculosis may be a
contributing factor [5]. The identification of additional risk
factors has the potential to reveal new approaches to alter
disease development or progression.

INTRODUCTION
Each year in the United States, nearly 24,000
individuals who have never smoked in their lifetime die
from lung cancer. This surprisingly places lung cancer in
never-smokers among the top 10 deadliest cancers in the
United States [1]. A significant fraction of lung cancers
that develop in never-smokers contain activating mutations
in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene
and depend upon EGFR signaling for survival [2, 3].

Emerging pre-clinical and epidemiologic data
suggest that low vitamin D levels may favor the
growth of EGFR mutant lung cancer [6–8]. Vitamin
D3 (VD3) is obtained through dietary intake or is
synthesized in the skin upon UVB exposure. VD3 is
converted within the liver into the primary circulating
metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3). Subsequently,
25D3 is converted by the CYP27B1-encoded
1α-hydroxylase (1αOHase) into the active metabolite,
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3). 1,25D3 binds to and
activates the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Ligand-bound
VDR functions as a transcription factor and regulates the
expression of genes that control cell differentiation, cell
cycle progression, and apoptosis [9–11]. We and others
have shown that 1,25D3 inhibits the in vitro growth of
some but not all lung cancer cell lines [12–14]. Among
the cell lines tested by us, HCC827 (EGFR del 746–750)
and H1975 (EGFR L858R/T790M) were found to express
relatively high levels of VDR and be particularly sensitive
to the growth inhibitory effects of 1,25D3 [14]. We
surmised based on our in vitro observations that EGFR
mutant lung cancers are vulnerable to the anti-cancer
actions of vitamin D. A corollary to our hypothesis,
which is supported by recent epidemiological studies,
is that low 25D3 levels increase risk of developing or
dying from EGFR mutant lung cancer: lower 25D3
levels are associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of
developing EGFR mutant adenocarcinoma of the lung
[6]. In NHANES III participants, higher serum 25D3
concentrations were associated with decreased risk of
dying from lung cancer only among nonsmokers (where
EGFR gene mutations are more common) [7]. A causal
role for 25D3 in controlling growth of EGFR mutant lung
cancer remains to be established.
High blood 25D3 levels may protect against cancer
because as its concentration increases, more 25D3 is
locally converted at extra-renal sites by the CYP27B1encoded 1αOHase into the active metabolite, 1,25D3
[15]. Alternatively, 25D3 may act via a CYP27B1independent mechanism of action. When present at high
concentrations in vitro, 25D3 binds to the VDR and acts
as a direct agonist [16, 17]. Furthermore, in CYP27B1-null
mice that lack any detectable 1,25D3, high dietary vitamin
D3 intake (>10,000 IU VD3/kg diet) induces VDR target
genes and prevents hypocalcemia and osteomalacia [18].
The contribution of CYP27B1 to 25D3 activities in EGFR
mutant lung cancer has not been investigated previously
but is important to understand because CYP27B1
expression is significantly decreased in EGFR mutant lung
cancer cells and xenografts by erlotinib (supplemental
microarray data in [19]), which is used as first-line therapy
in patients diagnosed with EGFR mutant lung cancer [20].
If 25D3 signals by a CYP27B1-independent mechanism,
then dietary vitamin D3 supplementation could still be
effective when utilized either concomitant with or after
erlotinib therapy.

Studies were designed by us to establish the effects
of 25D3 on gene regulation and growth of EGFR mutant
lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. We also investigated the
requirement for CYP27B1 in mediating the transcriptional
effects of 25D3. We identified 25D3 status as a novel host
factor that influences the growth of EGFR mutant lung
cancer and discovered that 25D3 signaling persists despite
dramatic reduction in CYP27B1 expression and 1αOHase
activity. The implication of our findings is that dietary
vitamin D3 supplementation may be used as a safe and
effective approach to increase 25D3 levels and slow the
growth of EGFR mutant lung cancer, even in tumors that
express CYP27B1 at low levels.

RESULTS
EGFR mutant NSCLCs express VDR and are
therefore targetable by 25D3
We postulated based on epidemiologic data that
vitamin D signaling can be exploited to suppress the
growth of EGFR mutant NSCLC. However, the extent to
which VDR (the primary component responsible for the
biological activity of vitamin D3) is expressed in EGFR
mutant NSCLC was unknown. To determine if VDR
protein is present in EGFR mutant NSCLC, we utilized
a lung cancer tissue microarray (TMA) constructed
within the Pathology Resource Network at Roswell
Park Cancer Institute. The array was comprised of 84
lung cancer cases derived from lifetime-never smokers,
where EGFR mutations are prevalent. VDR protein was
detected by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1A). Nuclear
VDR expression was quantified using the H-scoring
method, which reflects the percentage of cells (0–100)
stained at each intensity (0–3). To identify cores that
contained EGFR gene mutations, targeted sequencing
was performed for 48 cases in which matching frozen
tissue samples were available for DNA extraction. 19/48
cases (37.5%) had EGFR gene mutations (Figure 1B).
The common L858R mutation in exon 21 and the exon 19
deletion mutation (del 745/6–750) were detected in 6 and
5 cases, respectively. Compared to patients with exon 21
mutations, lung cancer patients harboring EGFR exon 19
deletions have both a better response rate to EGFR TKIs
(70–100% vs 20–67% respectively) and improved overall
survival (26–34 mos vs 8–17 mos, respectively) [21–23].
Among the samples that contained EGFR mutations, all
expressed VDR protein (Figure 1B). Cores with EGFR
Exon 19 deletions tended to have higher VDR H-scores
than cases harboring Exon 21 L858R mutations (Figure
1C). However, statistical significance was not achieved,
likely due to the small number of cases representing each
mutation. Nonetheless, these data demonstrate for the
first time that human EGFR mutant lung cancers express
nuclear VDR protein and may be vulnerable to the anticancer activity of vitamin D3.

25D3 mediates transcription and growth
inhibition in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells

HCC827 and H1975 cells were treated with either
vehicle control, 100 nM 1,25D3 as a positive control, or
1 μM 25D3. RNA was isolated to measure VDR target
genes including 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), cathelicidin
antimicrobial peptide (CAMP), and dual specificity
phosphatase 10 (DUSP10) [24–26]. Both vitamin D
metabolites induced transcription of all three target genes
in both cell lines (Figure 2A). However, stronger gene
induction was observed in HCC827 cells. In lung cancer
cells, 1,25D3 is well established as an antiproliferative
agent [12–14, 27]. To determine if 25D3 also inhibits
NSCLC cell growth, clonogenic growth assays were
performed. As shown in Figure 2B, clonogenic survival

Given that VDR is present in clinical cases of
EGFR mutant NSCLC, we next sought to establish the
biological activity of 25D3 in EGFR mutant NSCLC
cells. Two EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines that we
previously identified to express relatively high basal
levels of VDR were studied [14]: HCC827 cells that
harbor an EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation (del746–
750) and H1975 cells that harbor an L858R mutation
and T790M gatekeeper EGFR mutation. T790M renders
H1975 cells insensitive to EGFR TKI treatment.

Figure 1: VDR is expressed in EGFR mutant tumors. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from 84 lung tumors resected

from lifetime never-smokers diagnosed with lung cancer. The TMA was stained for VDR, and nuclear expression was quantified by a
reviewer blinded to sample identity. A. Images of cores in which VDR was detected at relatively low and relatively high levels, respectively.
Tumor cells that were scored for VDR are circled in green. B. VDR H-scores were calculated for lung tumors that harbor at least one EGFR
mutation. C. The VDR H-scores for cases harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations are displayed. Data are presented only
for those cases in which 3 cores were analyzed, and > 100 nuclei per core were scored. The lower, middle, and upper lines of each box

25D3 signaling effects are VDR-dependent

of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells was significantly
inhibited by 25D3. Greater than 50 percent inhibition
was achieved at ≥ 100 nM 25D3 in HCC827 cells and
1 μM 25D3 in H1975 cells. These data demonstrate that
25D3 is active at both the transcriptional and functional
levels in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells expressing VDR.
At disease presentation, the EGFR del746–750 mutation
(in HCC827 cells) is more commonly found than the
T790M mutation (in H1975 cells). Therefore, for the
remainder of the studies, we focused on the effects of
25D3 in HCC827 cells.

25D3 may be converted by lung cancer cells to
1,25D3 [28, 29], which binds with high affinity to VDR
to elicit downstream signaling. Alternatively, 25D3 may
itself bind VDR to regulate gene expression [17, 18].
To confirm that 25D3 signals through VDR in EGFR
mutant NSCLC cells, siRNA was used to suppress VDR
expression. Compared to cells transfected with control
siRNA (siCTRL), VDR mRNA expression was reduced by
70% in cells transfected with VDR siRNA (Figure 3). Cells

ethanol (EtOH) vehicle control, 100 nM 1,25D3 or 1 μM 25D3. Six and 24 h post treatment, RNA was isolated to study induction of VDR
target genes by qRT-PCR. Gene expression was normalized to EtOH controls. B. The ability of 25D3 to inhibit clonogenic growth was
tested by exposing HCC827 and H1975 cells to 25D3 at increasing concentrations. Data are from triplicate wells within a single experiment
and normalized to EtOH-treated controls (0 nM 25D3). Gene expression and clonogenic growth assays were performed a minimum of
three times. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate p < 0.05, treated versus vehicle-control by Student’s t test.

investigated if elevating serum 25D3 concentrations in
vivo would affect the growth of EGFR mutant NSCLC
xenografts. To do so, nude mice were placed on research
diets containing either 100 international units vitamin
D3/kilogram diet (IU VD3/kg) or 10,000 IU VD3/
kg diet (n = 10 mice per group). Once ingested, VD3
is rapidly converted into 25D3, thereby allowing for a
simple method of elevating serum 25D3 concentrations.
After seven weeks, when stable 25D3 blood levels were
achieved, HCC827 cells were subcutaneously injected into
the flank of each mouse. Tumors were first measurable
at day 21 post-implantation. At study termination, plasma
25D3 concentrations were 12 ng/mL for mice on the 100
IU VD3/kg diet and 68.5 ng/mL for mice on the 10,000
IU VD3/kg diet. 1,25D3 levels were less variable and
averaged 56.3 pg/mL in the 100 IU VD3/kg diet group
and 51.4 pg/mL in the 10,000 IU/kg group. The decline
in 1,25D3 levels in the 10,000 IU VD3/kg diet group
most likely result from suppression of renal CYP27B1
expression [30]. No toxicity was observed from the VD3containing diets, as evidenced by normal serum calcium
concentrations and steady increase in mouse weights
(data not shown). Mice receiving the 10,000 IU VD3/kg

transfected with siCTRL responded to 25D3 treatment by
inducing VDR target gene mRNA and protein expression
(Figure 3). In contrast, the transcriptional response to
both 1,25D3 and 25D3 was markedly diminished in cells
transfected with VDR siRNA, and induction of VDR
and CYP24A1 protein by vitamin D metabolites was
abrogated. We subsequently tested the ability of 25D3 to
regulate VDR target gene transcription and inhibit growth
in NSCLC cells that endogenously express low levels of
VDR. Unlike cells with high VDR expression (such as
HCC827, H1975, SK-LU-1, and H292), 25D3 was not
effective at inducing target gene transcription or inhibiting
colony formation in cells that express relatively low levels
of VDR (A427 and A549) (Supplementary Figure S1).
The siRNA and cell line studies indicate that the ability of
25D3 to signal in NSCLC cells is VDR dependent.

Dietary vitamin D3 suppresses tumor growth in
HCC827 lung tumor xenografts
Thus far, we have demonstrated that 25D3 is capable
of inhibiting the in vitro growth of EGFR mutant NSCLC
cells and inducing VDR target gene expression. Next, we

with EtOH vehicle control, 100 nM 1,25D3 or 1 μM 25D3. RNA or protein was extracted 6 h post treatment. qRT-PCR and Western
blot assays were performed to study vitamin D regulated genes and to confirm VDR knockdown. The VDR knockdown experiment was
repeated 4 times. The results that are presented are from a representative experiment.

dietary vitamin D3 supplementation because CYP27B1
expression is significantly decreased in EGFR mutant
lung cancer cells under pressure of erlotinib treatment
both in vitro and in vivo [19]. To address the requirement
for 1αOHase activity, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) were
used to inactivate the CYP27B1 gene in HCC827 cells.
HCC827 cells were transfected with CYP27B1 ZFNs,
and individual clones were isolated and tested for ZFN
activity using the Cel-I mutation detection assay. A ZFNmodified clone was identified, expanded, and found to
harbor an 11 base pair deletion at the ZFN cut site (Figure
5A). From the DNA chromatogram, we observed the
ZFNs did not result in complete CYP27B1 inactivation:
wild type DNA was still detected in addition to the ZFNmodified sequence. Although over 200 individual clones
were screened, we were unable to identify a complete
CYP27B1 knockout. Nonetheless, we hypothesized
that alteration of at least one allele may be enough to
drastically reduce the 1αOHase activity in HCC827
cells that express CYP27B1 at relatively low levels
(Supplementary Figure S2). Expression of 1αOHase was
examined by Western blot. CYP27B1-ZFN cells expressed
less than half the amount of 1αOHase as parental cells
(Figure 5A right panel). We next confirmed that the
vitamin D3 signaling axis was intact in the CYP27B1ZFN cells. To do so, cells were treated with 1,25D3,
which signals through VDR independent of 1αOHase
activity. Compared to parental cells, CYP27B1-ZFN cells
induced VDR target gene transcription to a similar extent
(data not shown). Thus, the ZFN transfection did not
adversely affect VDR signaling in HCC827 cells. Next,
we tested the ability of 25D3 to induce transcription and
growth responses in CYP27B1-ZFN cells. Over a range
of 25D3 concentrations, parental HCC827 and CYP27B1ZFN cells induced VDR target gene transcription in a
comparable manner, as indicated by overlapping dose
response curves (Figure 5B). Furthermore, 25D3 induces
VDR and CYP24A1 protein expression to a similar extent
in parental HCC827 and CYP27B1-ZFN cells (Figure 5C).
With regard to effects on growth, we achieved statistically
significant inhibition in parental HCC827 cells at ≥
300 nM 25D3. However, 1 μM 25D3 was required to
effectively suppresses clonogenic growth in CYP27B1ZFN cells (Figure 5D, right panel). These data indicate
that EGFR mutant NSCLC cells can tolerate a significant
reduction in 1αOHase activity, yet still respond to high
dose 25D3 supplementation.
Because we did not achieve a complete CYP27B1
knockout, CYP27B1-specific siRNA was transfected
into the ZFN cells to further reduce 1αOHase activity.
In CYP27B1 siRNA transfected cells, CYP27B1 mRNA
levels were reduced 5-fold compared to parental cells
and nearly 3-fold compared to ZFN cells (Figure 6A, left
panel). 1αOHase expression was lowest in CYP27B1ZFN cells transfected with siCYP27B1 (Figure 6A right
panel). VDR target gene transcription was examined

termination, 70% of mice that received high dietary VD3
and 30% of mice that received low dietary VD3 had tumor
volumes < 250 mm3 (Figure 4B).
An independent xenograft study was performed to
establish whether dietary vitamin D3 supplementation
could influence tumor outgrowth when initiated after
tumor establishment (Figure 4C). Twenty mice were
placed on the 100 IU VD3/kg diet, and 10 mice were
placed on the 10,000 IU VD3/kg diet (high diet controls).
Seven weeks later, HCC827 cells were implanted. One
week after tumor implantation, 10 mice that began on
the 100 IU VD3/kg diet were switched to the 10,000 IU
VD3/kg diet for the remainder of the study. All other mice
remained on the research diet to which they had been
originally randomized. Pilot studies performed in our
laboratory showed that switching diets is an efficient way
to rapidly increase serum 25D3 levels: 25D3 increased
from 4 ng/mL to 68 ng/mL within one week of switching
from the 100 IU VD3/kg diet to the 10,000 IU VD3/kg
diet. Tumor measurements began 6 days after diet-switch
(day 13 post-tumor injection). Consistent with our first
xenograft study, the tumor volumes of mice maintained
on the 10,000 IU VD3/kg diet at days 20 (p = 0.004), 24
(p = 0.004), 27 (p = 0.004), 31 (p = 0.043), 34 (p = 0.026),
and 38 (p = 0.016) post-injection were significantly
lower than that of mice maintained on the 100 IU VD3/
kg diet (Figure 4C, left panel). Tumor volumes in mice
on the 100 IU VD3/kg diet were not statistically different
than mice that were switched to the 10,000 IU VD3/kg
diet (Figure 4C, right panel). However, switching from a
100 to 10,000 IU VD3/kg diet was still beneficial, as a
significant difference in tumor growth rates between the
low and switched diet groups was observed (Figure 4D).
Collectively, these data indicate that vitamin D status
influences the growth of EGFR mutant NSCLC, and that
dietary VD3 supplementation may be used to raise serum
25D3 concentration and suppresses EGFR mutant NSCLC
growth.

25D3 signaling persists in CYP27B1 genetically
modified zinc finger nuclease cells
CYP27B1 encodes the 1αOHase that catalyzes
conversion of circulating 25D3 into 1,25D3. This
conversion occurs within the kidney but also at extrarenal sites including the lung, where CYP27B1 is
expressed [31, 32]. It is widely believed that 25D3
effects on tumor growth are primarily due to its local
conversion by 1αOHase to 1,25D3. The results presented
above suggest that 25D3 induces VDR target gene
transcription, inhibits clonogenic growth, and suppresses
outgrowth of EGFR mutant lung tumor xenografts.
However, it is unclear if the observed effects are due to
25D3 directly or through conversion of 25D3 to 1,25D3.
Determining whether 1αOHase is required for 25D3mediated activity advances the clinical potential of

25D3 acts as a VDR agonist when 1αOHase
is pharmacologically inhibited, and 1,25D3
production is abolished in EGFR mutant
NSCLC cells

in siRNA transfected cells that were treated with

using the ZFNs alone or in combination with siRNA,
we took an alternative approach to inhibit 1αOHase
pharmacologically with Ketoconazole. Ketoconazole
inhibits both 1αOHase and CYP24A1 (IC50 of 28 nM for
1αOHase versus 126 nM for CYP24A1) [33]. HCC827
cells were treated with 25D3, 25D3 plus Ketoconazole,
25D3 plus CTA091, or 25D3 plus Ketoconazole plus
CTA091. CTA091 is a selective CYP24A1 inhibitor
[34, 35] and is added to prevent CYP24A1-mediated
catabolism of 1,25D3. This allows for quantitation of
1,25D3 production in HCC827 cells. To confirm that the
inhibitors were functioning properly, we measured the
precursor 25D3, the active metabolite 1,25D3, and the
CYP24A1-generated catabolite 24,25(OH)2D3 (24,25D3)
at 0, 3 and 6 h post-treatment. In parental HCC827 cells,
25D3 was detected at 0 h in all treatment groups, but no
additional metabolites were detected. After 3 and 6 h of
25D3 treatment, 24,25D3 and 1,25D3 were detectable
(Table 1). When 1,25D3 catabolism was prevented by
CTA091, HCC827 cells produced nearly 200 pg/mL of
1,25D3. CTA091 effectively inhibited CYP24A1, as
shown by the reduction in 24,25D3 and increase in 1,25D3
production at 3 or 6 h (25D3+CTA091 versus 25D3 alone).
1αOHase inhibition with Ketoconazole was not fully
effective, as indicated by residual 1,25D3 production in
the 25D3 plus Ketoconazole and 25D3 plus Ketoconazole
plus CTA091 treatment groups. CYP27B1-ZFN cells
were subjected to the same treatments and vitamin D3
metabolite measurements. Compared to parental HCC827
cells, CYP27B1-ZFN cells produced significantly less
1,25D3 at 3 and 6 h (Table 1). Additionally, at 3 h,
Ketoconazole fully inhibited 1αOHase activity in the ZFN
cells: No 1,25D3 production is detected in cells treated
with 25D3 plus Ketoconazole or the combination of 25D3,
Ketoconazole, and CTA091. At 3 h, when no 1,25D3
production is detected and 1αOHase is fully inhibited in
CYP27B1-ZFN cells, 25D3 still induces VDR target gene
transcription (Figure 7). The most likely explanation for
these results is that at pharmacologic levels, 25D3 acts
as a direct VDR agonist. Similar trends in gene induction
in CYP27B1-ZFN cells were observed at 6 h (data not
shown).

mutations [40]. We reasoned that beneficial effects of
vitamin D could be revealed by (a) focusing on subsets of
NSCLC cells that express relatively high levels of VDR
protein (EGFR mutant NSCLC) and (b) using dietary
vitamin D3 to safely and chronically elevate 25D3 levels.
When EGFR mutant NSCLC cells were exposed to 25D3
in vitro, VDR target gene transcription was induced and
clonogenic growth was inhibited. Transcriptional and
growth responses were shown to be VDR dependent.
To test the ability of 25D3 to suppress EGFR mutant
xenograft growth, we implanted tumor cells in mice that
were pre-fed diets containing variable levels of VD3.
Mice with high dietary VD3 intake (10,000 IU VD3/kg
diet) had significantly smaller tumors than mice with low
dietary VD3 intake (100 IU VD3/kg diet). Subsequently,
we examined the effects of switching mice from the 100
IU VD3/kg diet to the 10,000 IU/kg diet after tumors were
implanted. Tumor growth rate was significantly reduced in
mice that received the diets supplemented with high levels
of VD3. These results are the first to identify vitamin D
status as a host factor that regulates growth of EGFR
mutant NSCLC and dietary vitamin D3 supplementation as
an effective way to elevate serum 25D3 concentrations and
slow tumor growth. Translational potential is supported by
our discovery that VDR is expressed in primary human
lung tumors that harbor EGFR gene mutations.
The ability of 25D3 to control tumor growth has
been demonstrated by others. The anti-proliferative
actions of 25D3 in vitro have been demonstrated in breast,
pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines [41–43]. In vivo,
dietary vitamin D3 supplementation protects against
cancer development [44–49] and inhibits outgrowth of
human breast and prostate tumor xenografts [50].
When HCC827 cells were treated with 25D3, we
observed potent gene regulation at both 3 h (Figure 7) and
6 h (Figure 2). However, the magnitude of gene induction
differed between time points for some (CYP24A1, CAMP)
but not all (DUSP10) genes. It has previously been
reported that the magnitude of CYP24A1 mRNA induction
by 1,25D3 shows steep time dependence [51]. Matilainen
et al demonstrate that 1,25D3 induces a 9-fold increase
in CYP24A1 mRNA within 2 h of treatment but a 400fold increase within 4 h. Furthermore, subsequent work by
the same laboratory demonstrates that not all VDR target
genes respond to 1,25D3 treatment with the same kinetics.
Rather, the slope of 1,25D3-induced transcription depends
upon the basal chromatin accessibility of VDR binding
regions [52]. Together, these studies provide a reasonable
explanation for why some but not all genes display steep
time-dependent differences in vitamin D-mediated gene
induction in our model system.
25D3 is metabolized into 1,25D3 by the 1αOHase
(encoded by CYP27B1). CYP27B1 is expressed in both
histologically normal and lung tumor tissue [31, 32, 53].
However, we (supplemental data) and others [54] find that
CYP27B1 mRNA expression is highly variable across

DISCUSSION
Previous work from our laboratory and others
identifies 1,25D3 as a potential therapeutic agent in
NSCLC [12–14, 36]. Clinical administration of 1,25D3
is hampered by hypercalcemia induction. However,
schedules that allow for high, intermittent delivery
of 1,25D3 without toxicity have been devised [37,
38]. Unfortunately, using these schedules, no benefit
of 1,25D3 administration in unselected patients with
advanced NSCLC has been observed [39]. NSCLC is a
heterogeneous disease characterized by both histologic
variation and the presence of distinct oncogenic driver

Cells were treated in duplicate with EtOH vehicle control, 1 μM 25D3(D), 1 μM 25D3 + 10 μM Ketoconazole (D+K),
1 μM 25D3 + 50 nM CTA091 (D+C), or 1 μM 25D3 + 10 μM Ketoconazole + 50 nM CTA091 (DKC) for the times
indicated. Cell homogenates were prepared and analyzed for vitamin D3 metabolites by LC-MS/MS. Pairwise comparisons
were made between 25D3, 24,25D3 and 1,25D3 levels in HCC827 and CYP27B1-ZFN cells treated with D+C. At 3 h
post-treatment, 1,25D3 was significantly different between cell lines (*p = 0.01). At 6 h post-treatment, 24,25D3 and 1,25D3
were significantly different between cell lines (**p < 0.01).
Alternatively, the lack of a CYP27B1 null clone may be
to the inefficiency of the ZFN technology. While several
advancements, including heterodimer formation prior to
nuclease cutting have been implemented, the ZFNs were
reported to have only 5–6% activity when purchased.
Despite our inability to completely inactivate
CYP27B1, we did successfully abrogate 1αOHase
activity by pharmacologically inhibiting residual enzyme
in CYP27B1-ZFN cells using Ketoconazole (Figure 7,
Table 1). In CYP27B1-ZFN cells treated with 25D3 plus
Ketoconazole plus CTA091, no 1,25D3 production was
detected. Yet, 25D3 (1 μM) retained its ability to induce
VDR target gene transcription. These observations
indicate that at pharmacologic concentrations, 25D3 acts
as a VDR agonist in EGFR mutant NSCLC. Others have
argued for agonist actions of 25D3, and such actions have

NSCLC cell lines and resected human lung cancers.
Variability in CYP27B1 could restrict the clinical utility
of dietary vitamin D3 supplementation. We therefore
tested whether 1αOHase-mediated conversion of 25D3
to 1,25D3 was required for signaling in EGFR mutant
NSCLC cells. To do this, we employed CYP27B1 specific
ZFNs. After screening several hundred clones, we were
unable to identify a clone with complete CYP27B1
inactivation. The clones we tested for ZFN activity
were only those that survived limiting dilution cloning
and serial passage. We observed that several clones did
not survive when we attempted to expand them. It is
possible that the non-surviving clones were those with
complete loss of CYP27B1. However, it is unclear why
complete inactivation of CYP27B1 would result in a lethal
phenotype because CYP27B1 null mice are viable [55–57].

been detected in the CYP27B1 null mouse using diets that
contain ≥ 10,000 IU VD3/kg [18].
How might our observations be used to inform
the use of vitamin D metabolites for management of
EGFR mutant lung cancers? CYP27B1-expressing EGFR
mutant lung cancer cells (HCC827) are able to produce
1,25D3 from 25D3 (Table 1). In lung cancer patients
that harbor tumors of this type, supplementation with
physiologic levels of vitamin D3 (as recommended by the
Institute of Medicine) would be expected to drive local
1,25D3 production and inhibit tumor growth. Physiologic
supplementation might be exploited to prevent disease
recurrence among vitamin D-deficient individuals
diagnosed with early stage EGFR mutant lung cancer
who undergo surgical resection with curative intent. In
contrast, we surmise that pharmacologic doses of vitamin
D3 may be required for therapeutic benefit in individuals
diagnosed with advanced EGFR mutant lung cancer who

receive erlotinib. This is because CYP27B1 expression
decreases significantly under the pressure of erlotinib
treatment [19]. An alternative strategy to activate VDR
in the context of erlotinib-driven CYP27B1 loss would be
to systemically administer the active metabolite, 1,25D3.
Supporting the viability of this approach, we find that
pharmacologic concentrations of 1,25D3 (100 nM) induce
gene expression and inhibit the growth of CYP27B1-ZFN
cells (data not shown). Further studies using CYP27B1ZFN xenografts will be required to determine whether
oral vitamin D3 supplementation and weekly systemic
administration of 1,25D3 provide comparable therapeutic
benefit and safety in vivo.
Prior to our studies, the expression of VDR
in primary human EGFR mutant lung tumors was
unknown. To fill this gap in knowledge, we analyzed
nuclear VDR expression in tumor cores from lifetime
never-smokers that had corresponding DNA available

Figure 7: 25D3 is active in HCC827 cells in the absence of detectable 1αOHase activity. Cells were treated in triplicate with
EtOH vehicle control, 1 μM 25D3(D), 1 μM 25D3 + 10 μM Ketoconazole (D+K), 1 μM 25D3 + 50 nM CTA091 (D+C) or 1 μM 25D3 + 10
μM Ketoconazole + 50 nM CTA091 (DKC) for 3 h. RNA was isolated and gene expression quantified by qRT-PCR. The 3 h timepoint was
chosen because 1αOHase was 90% inhibited in HCC827 cells and fully inhibited (below the lower limit of quantitation) in CYP27B1-ZFN
cells. Error bars represent standard error of the mean, and asterisks represent p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test for vehicle versus treated cells.

for targeted sequencing of the EGFR gene. We focused
on never-smokers because EGFR mutations are more
commonly observed in this subset of patients. Among
the 19 cases of EGFR mutant lung cancer that were
identified, we observed variation in VDR expression and
cell morphology. Of note, tumors that harbored EGFR
exon 19 deletions tended to have higher VDR expression
than those that harbored EGFR L858R mutations.
This is intriguing because patients with EGFR exon
19 deletions have better response rates to erlotinib and
overall survival compared to patients with EGFR L858R
mutations [21–23].
We also observed in our TMA studies that tumor cell
morphology in cores with higher VDR expression appears
more epithelial-like. This may suggest that vitamin D
signaling plays a role in maintaining tumor cells in an
epithelial state. Such an observation is consistent with
our prior which shows that 1,25D3 induces expression
of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin and opposes the
EMT-promoting actions of TGF-β in lung cancer cells
[58]. EMT initiating events including β-catenin nuclear
translocation have recently been shown to be essential
for the growth of EGFR mutant lung cancers [36]. A
vitamin D3-induced increase in E-cadherin expression
and localization at the plasma membrane could influence
β-catenin localization and prohibit its nuclear actions.
EMT is also a mechanism by which EGFR mutant lung
cancer cells become resistant to erlotinib therapy [19,
59–61]. Potentially, vitamin D-mediated maintenance of
epithelial phenotype may delay EMT onset and render
EGFR mutant NSCLC cells responsive to EGFR TKI
therapy for an extended period of time. The ability
of high dose vitamin D3 supplementation to delay
erlotinib resistance is currently under investigation in our
laboratory.

Reagents and chemicals
A 480 μM stock of 1,25D3 in 100% ethanol was
kindly provided by Dr. Candace Johnson (Roswell Park
Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA). For all treatments,
1,25D3 was diluted in cell culture media to a final
concentration of 100 nM. The vitamin D metabolite, 25D3,
was purchased from BioMol and prepared as a 1 mg/mL
(2.5 mM) stock in 100% ethanol. Prior to use, 25D3 was
diluted in cell culture media to a final concentration of
1 μM. Ketoconazole was purchased from Sigma Aldrich,
resuspended in DMSO and used at final concentrations
of 10 μM. The CYP24A1 inhibitor, CTA091, was kindly
provided by Martin Petkovich (martin.petkovich@
queensu.ca) and OPKO Health (Miami, FL) and was
diluted in cell culture media to a final concentration of 50
nM on the day of use.

RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per
well of a six well plate. For time-course gene expression
studies, cells were seeded and treated in charcoal
stripped serum (CSS) with antibiotics (Figure 2, Figure
7). All other gene expression studies were performed
in serum free media supplemented with antibiotics
(Figures 5, 6). Cells were collected in TRI-reagent
(Direct-Zol, RNA Mini-Prep Kit, Zymo Research,
Irvine, CA, USA) to extract RNA. Isolation was
carried out following the manufacturer’s instructions.
A NanoDrop was used to measure RNA concentrations.
All RNA had a 260/280 ratio of at least 1.98. RNA was
stored at -80°C. 500 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed
into cDNA in a final volume of 20 μL using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with the
addition of an RNAse inhibitor (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Protein extraction and western blot analysis

Cells were seeded in triplicate at a low density
optimized for each cell line (HCC827–650 cells/well,
H1975–650 cells/well, SK-LU-1–700 cells/well, H292–650
cells/well, and A549–650 cells/well). Cells were seeded and
treated in complete growth medium. Treatments included
vehicle control, 1,25D3, or 25D3 and were repeated every
2 days for 10–14 days. Colonies were fixed by adding 70%
methanol per well for 5 min. This fixation step was repeated,
followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet for 5 min. Water
was used to rinse the wells. Plates were dried at least 24 h
prior to counting colonies. Colonies were inspected using a
microscope, and a colony was defined as a cluster containing
at least 30 cells. The calculation for percent colonies
remaining for each treatment was calculated as follows:

Cells for protein analysis were collected into tissue
culture media and centrifuged at 118 x g for 6 min. Media
was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended and
washed in ice cold PBS. The wash was removed, and
proteins were extracted in Triton-X100/SDS lysis buffer
as previously described [62]. Cell pellets that were not
analyzed immediately were stored at -80°C. VDR (Thermo
Scientific, clone MA1–710) and CYP24A1 (Sigma,
Clone 1F8) were detected by Western blot, as previously
described [62]. Antibodies specific for 1αOHase were
obtained from ThermoFisher and The Binding Site.

CYP27B1 primers specific for exon 3 were used to amplify
genomic DNA via PCR. A portion of the PCR sample
was saved for detection of CYP27B1 products on a 1.2%
agarose gel. To conduct the CEL-I mutation detection
assay, the 20 μL PCR product was denatured/renatured
by running the following program on a thermocycler:
95°C 10 min, 95°C to 85°C, -2°/second, 85°C to 25°C,
-1°C/second, 4°C indefinitely. To this sample, 2μL of
nuclease S, 2μL of enhancer, and 2.4 μL of MgCl2 were
added (Surveyor Mutation Detection Kit, Transgenomic).
The reaction was incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes and
then terminated by adding 2.6 μL of Stop solution. 6X
sample buffer was added and the product was run on a
10% PAGE-TBE gel (BioRad) in 1X TBE Buffer for 90
minutes at 100 V. The gel was then exposed to a solution
of 1X TBE and Ethidium Bromide for 5 minutes and
imaged using a Gel Doc (BioRad, Quantity One Image
Analysis). ZFN modified DNA was indicated by the
presence of specific Cel-I generated restriction fragments.
The positive clone that demonstrated the greatest cutting
in the Cel-I assay was expanded and denoted as CYP27B1ZFN. Exon 3 of the CYP27B1 gene was sequenced in the
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Genomics Core and found
to contain an 11 base pair deletion at the targeted ZFN cut
site. Cel-I assays were performed after multiple passages
of CYP27B1-ZFN cells to confirm maintenance of the
ZFN-modified CYP27B1 alleles.

Then ZnSO4 [63] and methanol were added to the samples
to precipitate proteins. Hexanes were then added and the
samples vortexed. The samples were centrifuged, and
the organic hexane layer was collected and dried using a
savant dryer. The samples were re-constituted into LCMS
grade methanol and water both with 0.1% formic acid,
injected onto an Agilent 1290 HPLC with an Agilent
Poroshell 120 PFP 2.7 um 2.1 × 100 mm column coupled
to an Agilent 6460 Triple-quad mass spectrometer with
electrospray ionization source (ESI) in positive mode,
and then analyzed using Masshunter software. The 25D3
assay was run with NIST certified serum standards. The
extraction efficiency of 25D3 was 97%. The 24,25D assay
utilized a deuterated internal standard (d6–24,25D3 from
Medical Isotopes Inc. and non-deuterated 24,25D2 and
24,25D3 from Sigma-Aldrich). The extraction efficiency
of 24,25D3 was 96%, based on spiked sample recovery.
For analysis of 1,25D3, experimental samples,
standard curve, and quality control (QC) samples were
pipetted into boro-silicate test tubes and then spiked with
d6–1,25D3 (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins were precipitated
with equal parts acetonitrile to sample/standards/QC. After
acetonitrile addition, the samples were centrifuged and
poured into equal parts water. The samples were extracted
via solid phase extraction (SPE) using Diasorin C18-OH
0.5 g columns on a VAC-ELUT apparatus. After SPE, the
eluate was dried down and derivatized using 0.75 mg/
mL PTAD (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile for 2 h at room
temperature [64] The reactions were quenched with water,
vortexed, and dried down. The samples were reconstituted
into LCMS grade methanol and water both with 0.1%
formic acid, and then injected onto an Agilent 1290 HPLC
with an Agilent ZORBAX RRHD C18 1.8 um 2.1 × 50
mm column coupled to an Agilent 6460 Triple-quad mass
spectrometer with ESI in positive mode and analyzed
using Masshunter software. 1,25D3 extraction efficiency
was 81% based on lyophilized, certified DiaSorin standard
that was reconstituted with charcoal-stripped DiaSorin 0
calibrator serum.

HCC827 xenograft studies
Xenograft studies were performed under an
IACUC approved protocol, within the AAALAC-certified
laboratory animal resource at Roswell Park Cancer
Institute. For Study 1: 20 female nude mice between 4–6
weeks of age were purchased from Harlan Laboratories.
Immediately upon receipt, mice were randomized to
receive diets containing either 100 IU VD3/kg (n = 10)
or 10,000 IU VD3/kg (n = 10) (Research Diets Inc,
New Brunswick NJ). All other components of the diet
were identical. After 7 weeks on the diets, mice were
subcutaneously injected in the rear flank with HCC827
cells (5 × 106) in 200 μL PBS. Once tumors were palpable,
tumor measurements and mouse weights were obtained
once weekly. Tumor volumes were calculated using the
equation: Volume = (L × W2)/2. When at least one tumor
reached 1500 mm3, the study was terminated. Blood was
collected into heparinized syringes for determination of
25D3 (University of Pittsburgh) and 1,25D3 (Heartland
Assays). Graphs of tumor outgrowth data were created
using GraphPad Prism 6.
For Study 2: 30 female nude mice between 4–6
weeks of age were purchased from Harlan Laboratories.
Upon arrival, mice were randomized to receive research
diets containing either 100 IU VD3/kg (n = 20) or 10,000
IU VD3/kg (n = 10). Seven weeks later, 5 × 106 HCC827
cells in PBS were subcutaneously injected into the flank

CYP27B1 zinc finger nucleases and Cel-I
mutation detection assay
Custom CompoZr zinc finger nucleases (ZFN)
targeting CYP27B1 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
A ZFN mRNA pair was transfected into cells seeded
at a density of 4 × 105 cells per well in antibiotic free
medium. The final amount of zinc finger mRNA added
per transfection was 2 μg. TransIT and Boost (Mirus)
transfection reagents were used at a volume of 1 μL
per well of a 6-well plate. Medium was changed on
transfected cells the following morning. Forty-eight hours
later, cells were partitioned into three aliquots to allow for
genomic DNA extraction, limiting dilution cloning, and
maintenance/propagation. Genomic DNA extraction was
performed using the ChargeSwitch Kit from Invitrogen.

Statistical analysis for in vitro studies

of each mouse. One week after tumor implantation, 10
mice that began on the 100 IU VD3/kg diet were switched
to the 10,000 IU/kg diet. All other mice were maintained
on the diets to which they were originally assigned.
Measurable tumors were present on day 13 post-injection.
Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly using digital
calipers, and animal weights were measured once weekly
thereafter. The study was terminated when at least one
tumor reached a volume > 1500 mm3 (confirmed by two
independent measurements at least 4 d apart).
Statistical analysis was performed in collaboration
with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute Bioinformatics and
Biostatistics Department. Median tumor volumes were
log-transformed and compared using a Wilcoxon rank
sum test. In Study 2, tumor growth rates were calculated
by modeling the data (for first 14 days of measured tumor
outgrowth) using a linear mixed model. Tumor volumes
were transformed and modeled as a function of time,
diet, their interaction and a nested random mouse effect.
A first order auto-regressive function was used for the
covariance matrix. Model assumptions were graphically
verified using residual plots and quantile-quantile plots.
The resultant data presented the need to implement a ¼
root transformation.

All comparisons of gene expression and clonogenic
growth (treatment versus vehicle controls) were performed
using an unpaired t-test in GraphPad Prism 6, where
asterisks represent p < 0.05.

Tissue microarray
A tissue microarray consisting of tumors resected
from individuals who were lifetime-never smokers and
diagnosed with lung cancer was developed through the
Pathology Resource Network (PRN) at Roswell Park
Cancer Institute. The TMA was comprised of 84 patients,
with 3 tissue cores arrayed per patient. The TMA was
stained for VDR (Affinity Bio.; # MAI-710) as described
previously [65] and scored by a researcher blinded
to sample identity using Aperio software. Only VDR
staining in tumor cell nuclei was scored. The number of
nuclei scored per case was variable and depended upon
the size of cores and the density of tumor within each
core (range 241–1348). Cores were scored by assigning
the percent of positively stained nuclei a value between
0–3, with 0 representing no staining and 3 representing
intense staining. H-scores were calculated for each core,
as follows:
