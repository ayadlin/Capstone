Abstract
Neoadjuvant radio/chemotherapy regimens can markedly
improve cervical cancer outcome in a subset of patients, while
other patients show poor responses, but may encounter severe
adverse effects. Thus, there is a strong need for predictive
biomarkers to improve clinical management of cervical cancer
patients. STAT3 is considered as a critical antiapoptotic factor
in various malignancies. We therefore investigated STAT3
activation during cervical carcinogenesis and its impact on
the response of cervical cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs. Tyr705-phosphorylated STAT3 increased from lowgrade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1) to precancerous CIN3 lesions. Notably, pTyr705-STAT3 activation significantly declined from CIN3 to invasive cancer, also when
compared in the same clinical biopsy. pTyr705-STAT3 was
also low or absent in cultured human cervical cancer cell lines,
consistent with the in vivo expression data. Unexpectedly,

IL6-type cytokine signaling inducing STAT3 activation rendered cervical cancer cells signiﬁcantly more susceptible to
chemotherapeutic drugs, that is, cisplatin or etoposide. This
chemosensitization was STAT3-dependent and we identiﬁed
IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) as the STAT3-inducible mediator required for cell death enhancement. In line with these
data, pTyr705-STAT3 signiﬁcantly correlated with nuclear IRF1
expression in cervical cancer in vivo. Importantly, high IRF1
expression in pretreatment cervical cancer biopsy cells was
associated with a signiﬁcantly better response to neoadjuvant
radio/chemotherapy of the patients. In summary, our study
has identiﬁed a key role of the STAT3/IRF1 pathway for
chemosensitization in cervical cancer. Our results suggest that
pretherapeutic IRF1 expression should be evaluated as a novel
predictive biomarker for neoadjuvant radio/chemotherapy
responses. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3872–83. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

pithelial neoplasia (CIN1–3; ref. 1). This process takes years or
decades and it is assumed that further changes within the (pre)
neoplastic cells and their microenvironment critically inﬂuence
the course of disease.
Cervical cancer therapy is still a major clinical challenge.
Responses to neoadjuvant radio/chemotherapy vary greatly in
patients (2, 3). Intrinsic and acquired resistance of the neoplastic
cells as well as substantial side effects from standard treatment
including platinum-based chemotherapy limit the options for
escalation (4). Identiﬁcation of patients that may best beneﬁt
from chemotherapy would be useful for improved clinical management. This will require a better understanding of the mechanisms inﬂuencing the balance between sensitivity and resistance to
cervical cancer cell death.
The STAT3 transcription factor is commonly considered as a
survival or progression factor in different cancer types. Constitutive STAT3 activation is documented in various human malignancies including head and neck, brain, breast, lung, pancreas, as
well as prostate cancer and melanoma (summarized in ref. 5).
STAT3 inhibition can affect tumor growth and enhance the
response of certain tumors to chemotherapy directly or in an
immune-dependent manner (6–8).
Notably, STAT3 activation also has profound direct effects on
the immune microenvironment (9). Our group has previously
demonstrated pronounced tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT3
in cervical high-grade lesions (10). Strongly activated STAT3
was detected within the inﬂammatory inﬁltrate of the lesions,

Cervical cancer represents the third most common cause of
cancer-related death in women worldwide. Invasive cancer
develops from persistent high-risk human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection through well-deﬁned stages of cervical intrae-

STAT3/IRF1 Sensitizes Cervical Cancer to Chemotherapy

where it drives expression of the protumorigenic and vasculogenic matrix metalloprotease MMP-9, as well as in the premalignant epithelial cells (10).
Major activators of the STAT3 pathway are members of
the IL6-type cytokine family (11, 12). IL6 binds to the a-chain
of the IL6R (IL6Ra, gp80), while the related cytokine oncostatin M (OSM), binds to the OSM receptor-b (OSMRb).
Respective complexes then associate with the common receptor chain gp130, which recruits Janus kinases, leading to
subsequent STAT3-phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 (13).
Whereas gp130 is ubiquitously expressed, IL6 signaling is
limited by the availability of transmembrane gp80 or its naturally
occurring soluble form sgp80, which induces "trans-signaling" via
gp130 (14).
In human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix uteri,
IL6 is strongly upregulated in situ and in vitro (15). IL6 has a
negative impact on the prognosis of a patient (16). We have
shown that it mainly acts in a paracrine manner and creates a
protumorigenic and immunosuppressive microenvironment (10,
17, 18). Cervical cancer cells display only low responses to
autocrine IL6 due to low gp80 expression levels (15, 19) but
sgp80 can restore autocrine IL6 signaling and induce pronounced
STAT3-binding activity (15).
In this study, we investigated STAT3 activation during the
different stages of cervical carcinogenesis in more detail. In
biopsies comprising precancerous and cancerous lesions, we
demonstrate that STAT3 tyrosine-phosphorylation is highest
in CIN3 and signiﬁcantly declines during progression to
invasive cancer. Unexpectedly, when we forced STAT3 activation with IL6-type cytokines, cervical cancer cells were strongly
sensitized to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs.
We identiﬁed IRF1 as the STAT3-inducible proapoptotic factor
mediating chemosensitization. Notably, our data show that
pretreatment IRF1 expression correlates with the response to
radio/chemotherapy in cervical cancer patients in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Immunohistochemical analysis
Of note, 145 formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE)
anonymized lesions of the cervix uteri (22 CIN1/2, 29 CIN3,
94 SCC) were retrieved from local pathology archives of
Cologne, Leipzig, and Saarland University Hospitals, Germany.
These included a subset of 24 pretreatment SCC biopsies from
patients that had been subjected to neoadjuvant chemo- or
radio/chemotherapy. These tumors were pre- and post-therapeutically staged according to the International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) or TNM categories (Supplementary Table S1). Histologic stainings, diagnosis, and
treatment responses were assessed by expert pathologists
(C. Wickenhauser, L.C. Horn, L. Tharun, Y.-J. Kim, R.M. Bohle).
Staining of 5-mm sections with Abs listed in Supplementary
Table S2 was performed as described previously (10, 20) and
classiﬁed using the Immunoreactive Score (IRS) according to
Remmele and Stegner (21). Biopsies were evaluated with standardized settings with a DMI 6000B microscope (Leica) and
Microsoft Image Composite Editor program. The retrospective
study has been conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki
principles and was approved by the local Ethics Committees of
the Cologne, Leipzig, and Saarland Universities (at the Saar€
land-Arztekammer).

Cells and cell culture
Relatively low-passage cervical cancer cell lines 808 and 778
(22, 23) were last tested by short tandem repeat proﬁling in 2014.
HPV18-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines SW756 (ATCC CRL10302), HeLa (ATCC CCL-2), and HPV16-positive SiHa (ATCC
HTB-35) obtained from M. von Knebel Doeberitz (Department of
Applied Tumor Biology, Institute of Pathology, University of
Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) before 2000 were last authenticated by HPV16/18-E6/E7-qRT-PCR and multiplex human cell
line authentication test (Multiplexion) in April 2013 and cultured
as described previously (17). Normal human exocervical keratinocytes (NECK) isolated from hysterectomy specimens according
to ref. 24 were cultured in supplemented KBM-Gold (Lonza;
approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Saarland Univer€
sity at the Saarland-Arztekammer).
Written informed consent was
provided by the study participants.
Cell stimulation and Western blot analysis
Carcinoma cells or NECK were seeded at a density of 1.5  106
cells in a 6-cm culture dish. Twenty-four hours later, they were
incubated with medium, 10 ng/mL OSM, or 100 ng/mL IL6
(PeproTech) in the presence of 500 ng/mL sgp80 (R&D Systems;
IL6/sgp80) for the indicated time intervals. Whole cell or nuclear
extracts were prepared as described in ref. 25. Abs listed in
Supplementary Table S2, secondary Abs (Sigma-Aldrich), and
ECL reagent (Roche) were used for detection with ChemiDoc
XRSþ Molecular Imager. All Western blots were performed under
standardized conditions. Expression was quantiﬁed with the
Quantity One analysis software (both Bio-Rad).
Plasmids and transfections
IRF1 and IRF2 cDNAs (26) were ampliﬁed with primers listed
in Supplementary Table S3, cloned as NotI/SalI fragments in
pCMV-Flag2 vector (Sigma-Aldrich) and sequences were veriﬁed.
A total of 1.5  105 HeLa cells/6-well were transfected after 24
hours with 0.0 (mock control), 0.025 or 0.1 mg pCMV-Flag2-IRF1,
or 0.6 or 0.8 mg pCMV-Flag2-IRF2 expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The total amount of DNA was
adjusted to 1 mg with empty pCMV-Flag2 vector. Six or 10 pmol
of indicated siRNAs (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting siRNA #2,
ON-TARGETplus siRNA #8 for human STAT3, siRNA #6 for IRF1,
all from Thermo Scientiﬁc) were transfected with Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Invitrogen) as described previously (20).
Cytotoxicity assays
In cytotoxicity assays with cisplatin (Hexal) or etoposide (Sigma-Aldrich) cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of
1.0104 cells/well, stimulated with medium, OSM, or IL6/sgp80
for 8 hours and challenged for 48 hours with serial dilutions of
chemotherapeutic drugs if not indicated otherwise. siRNA-transfected cells were pretreated for 2 hours and subsequently challenged with chemotherapeutic drugs for 20 hours. Cell viability
was assessed by the neutral red uptake method as described
previously (27). For sequential staining with Annexin-V–APC
(BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich)
assays were scaled up to 24-well plates and analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
HeLa and SW756 cells were stimulated for 2 hours if not
indicated otherwise. cDNA synthesis, qRT-PCR, and normalization

and 6 of 94 (6.4%) showed a moderate IRS (Fig. 1C). Positive
pTyr705-STAT3 staining in SCCs was preferentially detected at
the tumor borders adjacent to stroma. The pTyr705-STAT3 IRS
did not correlate with FIGO stage (Supplementary Fig. S1). In
negative SCCs, proper staining was ascertained by positively
stained stromal inﬁltrating or endothelial cells. Notably, epithelial pTyr705-STAT3 staining was signiﬁcantly weaker in
SCCs than CIN3 (Fig. 1B and C; P < 0.0001) and this was also
observed, when both SCC and CIN3 were present in the same
biopsy (Fig. 1D).
These results demonstrated that STAT3 is activated in human
cervical epithelium during carcinogenesis peaking in CIN3. However, during progression from CIN3 to invasive cancer, STAT3
activation signiﬁcantly declines or is lost.

Decline of STAT3 tyrosine-phosphorylation during malignant
progression in human cervical carcinogenesis in situ
In tissue sections from the different stages of human cervical
carcinogenesis, we found activated STAT3 throughout all premalignant stages, however with different intensities. In lowgrade CIN, staining was mostly conﬁned to the cells of the
suprabasal layers (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in CIN3 pTyr705-STAT3
staining was detected in all epithelial layers and was strongest
when a stromal inﬂammatory STAT3-positive inﬁltrate was
present (Fig. 1A; ref. 10). The pTyr705-STAT3 staining score
was signiﬁcantly higher in CIN3 than in CIN1 or CIN2 (Fig. 1A
and C; P < 0.0001), also in biopsies where both, low- and highgrade CIN, were present (Fig. 1D).
Unexpectedly, 49 of 94 (52.1%) SCCs displayed only weak
pTyr705-STAT3 staining, 39 of 94 (41.5%) were rated negative,

OSM and IL6/sgp80 signaling activate STAT3 in cervical
carcinoma cells
The same pTyr705-STAT3–speciﬁc Ab was used to analyze
STAT3 phosphorylation in the established cervical SCC cell lines
SW756 and SiHa, the adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa, as well as in
the more recently generated cervical cancer cell lines 808 and 778
(22, 23). In medium controls, only faint constitutive STAT3
activation was observed. Stimulation with OSM or IL6/sgp80,
led to a pronounced STAT3 phosphorylation in cervical cancer
cells (Fig. 2), which was generally stronger than in NECK as shown
in prolonged exposures of the Western blots (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Thus, constitutive cell-autonomous STAT3 phosphorylation
in cervical cancer cells is low or absent but strongly inducible by
IL6-type cytokine signaling.

to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were
performed as described previously (17, 25, 28). The 72-bp
fragment of IRF1 was detected with primers listed in Supplementary Table S3 and probe no. 36 (Roche Universal Probe Library;
Roche).

two-sided t test was applied. Signiﬁcances are indicated by asterisks ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;  , P < 0.001). Correlations of

STAT3/IRF1 Sensitizes Cervical Cancer to Chemotherapy

Figure 2.
OSM or IL6/sgp80 strongly activate STAT3 in
cervical cancer cells. HeLa, SW756, SiHa, 808,
788 cells, and NECK were stimulated with medium,
OSM, or IL6/sgp80 for 15 minutes. Whole cell
extracts were analyzed by Western blot analysis
using anti-pTyr705-STAT3-, STAT3-, or
b-actin–speciﬁc Ab.

OSM and IL6/sgp80 signaling sensitize cervical cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic drug–induced cell death
As STAT3 protects various cell types from cell death (6, 29), we
were interested whether OSM or IL6 trans-signaling inﬂuenced
cell death induction by chemotherapeutic drugs in cervical cancer
cells. Initially, HeLa cells were prestimulated with OSM for
different time intervals, which did not signiﬁcantly change cellular
viability, and subsequently treated with cisplatin, the most common drug used in cervical cancer chemotherapy. Unexpectedly,
OSM preactivation did not prevent but enhanced cisplatinmediated cell death in HeLa cells as judged by combined
Annexin-V/PI ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 3A). Two hours of OSM pretreatment were sufﬁcient for signiﬁcant sensitization to cisplatininduced cell death (P < 0.0001), which was further increased by
15% (P ¼ 0.001) after 8 hours of pretreatment (Fig. 3B).
We therefore used an 8-hour cytokine pretreatment schedule
for our series of cervical cancer cell lines. Stimulation with OSM or
IL6/sgp80 alone neither altered cellular viability (Fig. 3 and 4) nor
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S3) under any condition tested.
Cisplatin killed the individual cell lines at different concentrations. Notably, as a uniform response in all tested cancer cell lines,
we observed a signiﬁcant increase in cisplatin-induced cell death
after pretreatment with IL6/sgp80 (26%–54% increase for the
highest cisplatin dose, P values from 0.0002 to 0.0079) or OSM
(19%–52% increase, P values 0.0003–0.0038; Fig. 4A). Similar
observations were made for etoposide, another chemotherapeutic
drug in clinical use for cervical cancer treatment (30). Etoposideinduced cell death increased by 64% or 55% in HeLa (P values
0.0001 or 0.003) and 72% or 69% (P values 0.0001 or 0.0004) in
SW756 after pretreatment with OSM or IL6/sgp80, respectively
(Fig. 4B). In contrast, NECK were not signiﬁcantly sensitized
(P > 0.3917) to either of the chemotherapeutic drugs by IL6/
sgp80 or OSM (Fig. 4A and B).
Cervical cancer cells produce IL6 but their autocrine IL6
response is limited due to low expression of the receptor gp80
(15, 19). To restore autocrine signaling, HeLa and SW756 cells
were pretreated with sgp80 alone without exogenous IL6. Nota-

bly, sgp80 was sufﬁcient to strongly sensitize both cell lines to
cisplatin- (Fig. 4C; P ¼ 0.021 or 0.0015) or etoposide-induced cell
death (Fig. 4D; P < 0.0001).
These data demonstrated that reconstitution of autocrine IL6
signaling, IL6 trans-signaling, or OSM can sensitize cervical cancer
cells but not normal human exocervical keratinocytes for chemotherapeutic drugs.
STAT3 mediates sensitization for cell death by OSM and IL6/
sgp80 signaling in cervical cancer cells
To investigate the involvement of STAT3 in chemosensitization in cervical cancer cells, STAT3-speciﬁc siRNA was used to
knockdown STAT3 expression in HeLa (Fig. 5A, C, and D) and
SW756 cells (Fig. 5B, E, and F). In both cell lines, STAT3
knockdown signiﬁcantly reverted OSM- or IL6/sgp80-mediated
sensitization to cell death induced by cisplatin (reversion up to
97%; P > 0.0021; Fig. 5C and E) or etoposide (reversion up to
96%, P > 0.0012; Fig. 5D and F), while control siRNA did not.
Similar results were obtained with an independent STAT3
siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To further substantiate this ﬁnding, HeLa cells were transiently
transfected with a dominant-negative version of STAT3 interfering
with phosphorylation at Tyr705 (dnSTAT3-Y705F, STAT3F), treated with OSM, and subsequently challenged with etoposide.
Transfected cells were visualized by EGFP coexpression. STAT3F
overexpression completely restored cellular viability further
underlining that STAT3 activation is required for cell death
sensitization (Supplementary Fig. S5).
These data provided evidence that chemosensitization by
IL6-type cytokines depends on the STAT3 pathway in cervical
cancer cells.
OSM and IL6/sgp80 signaling in cervical cancer cells strongly
induce IRF1 in a STAT3-dependent manner
To further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying cell
death sensitization, we performed mRNA gene expression analysis in SW756 cells after OSM or IL6/sgp80 stimulation. Strong

upregulation of CCL2 conﬁrmed our previously published results
(15) and validated the assay (data not shown). Besides CCL2, the
transcription factor IRF1, which has proapoptotic activities (31)
was signiﬁcantly upregulated after IL6/sgp80 or OSM stimulation.
qRT-PCR revealed a rapid (within 2 hours) and strong (10- to 12fold) induction of IRF1 mRNA after OSM or IL6/sgp80 stimulation in HeLa and SW756 cells (Fig. 6A; P <0.0001). IRF1 protein
induction after 2 hours of IL6/sgp80 or OSM stimulation was
demonstrated in nuclear extracts of both cervical cancer cell lines
(Fig. 6B) but not in NECK (Supplementary Fig. S6).
To verify nuclear IRF1 expression in vivo, IHC staining was
performed in a subset (n ¼ 79) of cervical cancers (Fig. 6C) and
compared with pTyr705-STAT3 staining results. Notably, the IRS
of both factors, pTyr705-STAT3 and nuclear IRF1, signiﬁcantly
correlated with each other (Fig. 6D; r¼0.3984, P ¼ 0.0003). These
results indicated that both factors might be functionally linked to
each other and prompted us to analyze a causal role of STAT3 for
IRF1 induction. Indeed, as shown with both, HeLa and SW756
cells, STAT3 knockdown signiﬁcantly suppressed OSM-induced
IRF1 induction (Fig. 6E).
These data provided evidence for a STAT3-dependent mechanism of IRF1 induction in cervical cancer cells.
IRF1 mediates sensitization for cell death by OSM and IL6/
sgp80 signaling in cervical cancer cells
To investigate a direct impact on cell death sensitization of
cervical cancer cells, IRF1 or its functional antagonist IRF2 were

3876 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

transiently overexpressed as conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 7A and B). Neither IRF1, IRF2 (in the absence or presence of
OSM), nor empty expression vector alone signiﬁcantly altered
cellular viability (Supplementary Fig. S7). However, IRF1 overexpression was sufﬁcient to sensitize the cancer cells to etoposidemediated cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A).
Correspondingly, IRF2 signiﬁcantly interfered with OSM-mediated sensitization for etoposide-mediated cell death (Fig. 7B).
Knockdown of endogenous IRF1 with IRF1-speciﬁc siRNA in
HeLa (Fig. 7C and D) and SW756 cells (Fig. 7E and F) strongly
suppressed OSM-mediated IRF1 protein induction (92% or
78.5%; Fig. 7C and E) and signiﬁcantly reverted sensitization to
etoposide- or cisplatin-induced cell death in both cell lines (Fig.
7D and F). Similar results were obtained with a second independent IRF1-speciﬁc siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S8).
IRF1 expression is associated with response to radio/
chemotherapy in cervical cancer patients
We then evaluated IRF1 expression in human cervical cancer
biopsies prior to neoadjuvant radio/chemotherapy in relation to
the patient's individual response to therapy (Supplementary
Table S1). Patients with complete response to radio/chemotherapy displayed signiﬁcantly higher scores of pretherapeutic nuclear
IRF1 expression in neoplastic cells than patients with only partial
response to therapy (Fig. 7G, left; P ¼ 0.0378). This was also
observed when total IRF1 expression (nuclear and cytoplasmic)
was evaluated (Fig. 7G, right; P ¼ 0.0033).

STAT3/IRF1 Sensitizes Cervical Cancer to Chemotherapy

it is highly desirable to identify those patients that may beneﬁt
from neoadjuvant radio/chemotherapy and to distinguish them
from putative partial- or nonresponders.
Our study has unraveled a key role of the STAT3-dependent
IRF1 pathway for chemosensitization. This was unexpected, as
STAT3 is considered as a survival factor in various other cancer
types. IRF1 was inducible by IL6-type cytokines via STAT3 activation in cervical cancer cells and in vivo, nuclear IRF1 and pSTAT3
expression scores signiﬁcantly correlated with each other. Importantly, our data show that cervical cancer patients with higher IRF1
expression scores responded signiﬁcantly better to radio/chemotherapy. This may have major implications for personalization of
cervical cancer chemotherapy.
Our study has unraveled novel ﬁndings on the activation and
function of the transcription factor STAT3 in cervical carcinogenesis. Comparing different human CIN stages, we found that
STAT3-tyrosine-phosphorylation dramatically increased from
low-grade CIN1 to preinvasive CIN3 lesions. This was in line
with observations in various murine tumor models (32, 33) and
supports the notion that STAT3 activation has an important role at
precancerous stages of cervical carcinogenesis. Unexpectedly, in
biopsies comprising both CIN3 and SCC, we observed a strong
decline of STAT3 activation during progression to invasive cancer.
The pTyr705-STAT3 staining score was weak in more than half or
negative in more than 40% of invasive cervical cancers. Positive
staining was mostly conﬁned to the tumor borders adjacent to the
stroma, suggesting a paracrine mode of STAT3 activation. In line
with our results, another study found pTyr705-STAT3 in less than
10% of cells in most cervical cancer cases (34) and two previous
studies detected pTyr705-STAT3 (35) or stronger nuclear STAT3
staining (36, 37) in 22%–24% of cervical cancers. Only one group
detected higher percentages of STAT3-phosphorylation in cervical
cancers in an Indian population (38). Whether the results of the
latter study are due to ethnical, environmental, or technical issues
remains to be determined. Higher FIGO stages in Indian patients
can probably be excluded as the basis for these differences, as we
did not observe a correlation between pTyr705-STAT3 IRS and
FIGO stage. To our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst report on the
direct comparison of precancerous and invasive cervical cancer
lesions within the same clinical specimen and the ﬁrst to demonstrate a strong decline of STAT3 activation during progression
to malignancy. Whether this particular reaction pattern is a
consequence of the viral etiology of cervical carcinogenesis will
be of high interest for future research. From our data, we conclude
that in most cervical cancers STAT3 activation is balanced at a low
level. A high level of STAT3 activation is obviously not required for
the malignant cells and may be counter selected during progression to SCC. In fact, our attempts to overexpress a constitutively
active form of STAT3 in cervical cancer cells failed and did not give
rise to cell clones (unpublished observation).
STAT3 is generally considered as an antiapoptotic factor and the
IL6 signaling pathway can promote resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in different cancer types (6, 7). In contrast, we found that
cervical cancer cells were not protected but sensitized for chemotherapeutic drugs by IL6-type cytokine-induced STAT3 signaling
as shown via STAT3 knockdown or dominant-negative STAT3F
(13). In our study we used the alkylating agent cisplatin, the
chemotherapeutic drug most commonly used against cervical
cancer. Moreover, a higher sensitivity was also observed for the
topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide used in recurrent cervical
cancer (30), indicating that the sensitization was not restricted to a

www.aacrjournals.org

single class of chemotherapeutic drugs. Although the IL6-/STAT3pathways appear to be attractive pharmacologic targets to
improve the immune microenvironment (9, 10, 17, 18), our data
suggest that one should be cautious to combine STAT3 inhibitors
with cisplatin or etoposide in cervical cancer patients.
In search of the mechanism underlying IL6-type cytokineinduced STAT3-dependent chemosensitization, we identiﬁed
IRF1, a proapoptotic factor, antioncogene, and regulator of autophagy (39–42). Notably, there are complex interactions between
HPV and IRFs. IRF1 and 2 can activate the HPV16 oncogene
promoter (43, 44) and the E5 oncoprotein induces IRF1 (45). In
contrast, the E7 oncoprotein can suppress IFNg-induced IRF1
expression and interferes with the effectiveness of the immune
response (46, 47). Our data clearly show that IL6/sgp80- or OSMinduced STAT3 signaling sensitizes HPV-positive cervical cancer
cells for chemotherapeutic drugs via IRF1 upregulation. This
suggests that STAT3 activation may override IRF1 inhibition by
HPV. HPV transformation may be necessary in keratinocytes for
the unusual STAT3 effect mediating IRF1 induction but it is
apparently not essential in other cell types. It was observed before
in murine myeloid leukemic M1 cells, where STAT3/IRF1 signaling is associated with growth arrest and differentiation (13, 48,
49). The consequences of STAT3/IRF1 pathway activation in
cervical cancer cells in the absence of cancer therapy are under
current investigation in our laboratory.
As IRF1 was sufﬁcient to render cervical cancer cell lines more
susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs, we were interested in the
in vivo expression of IRF1 in human cervical cancer. In patient
samples, nuclear IRF1 correlated signiﬁcantly with pTyr705STAT3 activation. This was interesting, as IRF1 can also be induced
by pathways other than STAT3 (39). Clinically most important,
we detected the highest IRF1 pretreatment expression scores in
cancers of those patients who responded completely to neoadjuvant or radio/chemotherapy. In contrast, partial- or nonresponders displayed signiﬁcantly lower IRF1 expression scores. The
results were similar, irrespective of whether nuclear or total IRF1
expression in the neoplastic cells were taken into account. This is
plausible, as higher basal IRF1 expression levels, which may be
determined at the genetic level (50), can also contribute to a
stronger IRF1 activation during the course of chemotherapy.
In summary, our data provide novel mechanistic insight on the
contributory role of STAT3 in inducing IRF1 and thereby chemosensitization of cervical cancer cells. On the basis of these results,
pretreatment IRF1 expression should be evaluated as a predictive
biomarker for the individual response of cervical cancer patients to
neoadjuvant radio/chemotherapy in prospective clinical studies.
