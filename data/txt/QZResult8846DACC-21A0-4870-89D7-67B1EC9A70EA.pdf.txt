remotely control transcription of target genes through chromatin proximity. Two densely mapped
DERE regions located on chromosomes 17q23 and 20q13 were frequently amplified in ERαpositive luminal breast cancer. These aberrantly amplified DEREs deregulated target gene
expression potentially linked to cancer development and tamoxifen resistance. Progressive
accumulation of DERE copies was observed in normal breast progenitor cells chronically exposed
to estrogenic chemicals. These findings may extend to other DNA regulatory elements, the
amplification of which can profoundly alter target transcriptome during tumorigenesis.

INTRODCUTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For more than two decades, considerable efforts aimed at identifying oncogenes located near
or within amplified genomic regions in cancer have been at the forefront of cancer research
(Albertson 2006; Lupski et al., 2005; Stephens et al., 2011). A longstanding view is that
these amplification events contribute to increased expression dosages of genes located in the
regions for oncogenesis. The first oncogene, MYCN, mapped to chromosome 2p24 is
amplified up to 300 copies in homogeneously staining regions of neuroblastomas (Schwab
et al., 1983). High MYCN transcription levels typically accompanied with this genomic
copy-number gain (Schwab 1999). ERBB2, localized on chromosome 17q21, is another
well-characterized gene frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (Santarius
et al., 2010; Slamon et al., 1987). These findings indicate that genomic amplification is a
major mechanism underlying the activation of oncogenes during tumor development.

Intensive efforts have recently been undertaken to globally screen for and analyze genomic
amplicons in breast cancer (Curtis et al., 2012; Nikolsky et al., 2008; Pollack et al., 2002;
Santarius et al., 2010). In a study of 2,000 primary breast tumors, copy-number gains were
frequently found on chromosomes 1q, 7p, 8, 11q, 14q, 16, 17q and 20q (Curtis et al., 2012).
Oncogenes including PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2, and FOXA1 located in these amplicons were
overexpressed in specific breast cancer subtypes. However, other copy-number gains were
not necessarily correlated with up-regulation of candidate loci found in amplicons (Cancer
Genome Atlas Network 2012; Curtis et al., 2012; Santarius et al., 2010). In other global
surveys, >80% of amplified or structurally rearranged regions did not harbor protein-coding
or microRNA loci aberrantly expressed in cancer (Hampton et al., 2009; Stephens et al.,
2011). In those cases, copy-number gains of DNA regulatory elements with the strong
potential to impact target gene transcription have often been overlooked. Transcription
repressors or activators usually bind to these regulatory regions located near transcription
start sites (TSSs) of genes. Furthermore, increasing evidence has recently indicated that
DNA regulatory regions are remotely located downstream or far upstream from TSSs or
even on different chromosomes. Through intra- or inter-chromatin looping, these regulatory
elements are brought near TSSs for transcriptional repression or activation of target genes
(Carroll et al., 2006; Fullwood et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2008; Visel et al.,
2009). Frequent chromatin interactions may increase DNA breaks at or nearby the looping
sites, contributing to genomic instability in cancer cells. Inappropriate DNA repair may lead
to genomic fusion and duplication of regulatory elements and gene promoters (Berger et al.,
2011; Lin et al., 2009; Mani et al., 2009). In addition to oncogene amplification, we
hypothesize that genomic amplification of DNA regulatory elements offers another
mechanistic explanation for extensive transcription alterations during tumorigenesis.
Our goal in this study was to comprehensively map distant estrogen response elements
(DEREs) in breast cancer that regulate the transcription of remote target genes using
integrated next-generation sequencing approaches. We also examined the role of estrogen
receptor activation through its ligand estradiol in enhancing DERE-mediated transcriptional

control and aberrant gains of DERE copy. Furthermore, we addressed whether DERE
amplification can be associated with endocrine resistance in breast cancer

RESULTS
Integrative Analyses Identify Densely Mapped DERE Regions
To globally survey estrogen-induced chromatin interaction events, we performed
chromosome conformation capture (3C) coupled with paired-end sequencing in MCF-7 cells
stimulated with E2 (17β-estradiol, 70 nM) for 24 hr (Dekker et al., 2002; Hagège et al.,
2007). Based on our previous study, progressive increases in chromatin interaction
frequency occurred during this stimulation period (Hsu et al., 2010). Cross-linked chromatin
was digested with BamHI for subsequent diluted ligation (Figure 1A, STEP 1). Ligated
DNA fragments attributed to different chromosome regions coming into close proximity
through chromatin looping were subjected to paired-end sequencing (total 0.3 billion 51-bp
sequence reads; Table S1). Poisson regression modeling was used to determine true
chromatin-looping events (FDR=8.35%). To demonstrate the reliability of this 3C assay,
reproducibility, saturation, and sensitivity analyses were also conducted on two biological
replicates (Figure S1A–B and Table S2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As the above sequencing approach might capture structural fusions, we comprehensively
mapped all putative translocation sites in MCF-7 cells by mate-pair sequencing with ~31X
converge of the genome (total 2.4 billion 51-bp sequence reads;Table S3). All potential
false-positive fusions produced by random ligations were eliminated using Poisson
regression modeling (FDR<0.000001). A total of 429 translocation fusions were identified
in the MCF-7 genome (Table S4). By excluding these translocation events from the 3C
dataset, 6,634 and 8,269 chromatin interaction events were unique to the control and E2stimulated cells, respectively (Figure 1A, STEP 2; Tables S5–6).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further define DERE-associated chromatin interactions, we performed a time-course
chromatin immunoprecipitation using an ERα antibody coupled with single-end sequencing
(ERα ChIP-seq) in MCF-7 cells stimulated with E2 for 0, 0.5, 1 and 24 hr (Figure 1A,
STEP3). A total of 0.3 billion 51-bp sequence reads were processed and 58.9% of those
reads mapped to unique chromosome locations (Table S7). The wBELT Peak Calling
program was applied to identify specifically ERα-bound DEREs upon E2 stimulation (Hsu
et al., 2010). De novo binding events (n=11,397) accumulated by 1 hr and decreased by 24
hr. Integration with the aforementioned chromatin looping data, we found 505 DEREassociated chromatin interaction events after E2 treatment for a 24-hr period (Figure 1A,
STEP3). Notably, 408 pre-existing interactions simultaneously disappeared, consistently
supporting our previous finding that ERα binding also results in chromatin dissociation in
target sites (Hsu et al., 2010). In addition, 76 of these pre-existing interaction events
remained unchanged upon E2 stimulation. When categorizing these interaction sites based
on their genomic locations, we found that DEREs from either the same or different
chromosomes frequently interacted with each other, accounting for ~49% of all interaction
events (Figure 1B). As expected, DEREs were found to interact with an overall large
number of target genes through intra- and inter-chromatin looping (n=467). However, only
4–8% of all DERE interactions occurred near promoter regions while the majority (37–39%)
of these interaction sites occurred within gene bodies (Figure 1B).
Interestingly, DERE interaction sites were frequently clustered in specific chromosome
regions, such as 1p13, 3p14, 17q23, and 20q13 (Figures 1C and S1C). Pair-wise heat maps
depicting interaction frequencies between different DEREs showed that chromatin segments
on 20q13 or 17q23 most frequently interacted with other segments on different
chromosomes (see purple arrows in Figure 2A). In addition, these two regions displayed the

highest density (46–51 sites per megabase) of DEREs bound by ERα compared to other
genomic regions (e.g., 3q23, 2–5 sites per megabase) after E2 treatment (Figure 2B, blue
and red landscape maps, and Table S8). We also found that these two regions contained hot
spots for genomic translocations (Figure 2B, purple maps; Figure S2A–B). When surveying
the entire MCF-7 genome, we observed that 23.6% of all fusion events occurred between
17q23 and 20q13 (Figure 2C). Moreover, these densely localized DEREs were frequently
mapped near or at clustered breakpoints in 17q23 and 20q13 regions (5–10 breakpoints per
megabase) compared to other non-clustered regions (p<0.001; Figure 2D). Additional data
indicate that estrogenic stimulation leads to distant chromatin interactions involving ERαbound DEREs, most notably in 17q23 and 20q13 (Table S8).
Amplified DERE Copies are Linked to Adverse Outcome of ERα-positive Luminal Breast
Cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to chromosomal fusions, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
analysis indicated that DERE copies in 20q13 were increased with time in E2-treated
MCF-7 cells (Figure 3A; statistics of 20q13 DERE copies shown in right-upper scatter plot).
Notably, long-term E2 exposure also triggered the formation of DERE clusters (see inserted
squares and right-lower scatter plot). Quantitative PCR analyses further confirmed that
estrogen stimulation significantly led to DERE amplification on 17q23 and 20q13 regions in
MCF-7 cells (p<0.001; Figure 3B). The ERα antagonist- ICI 182,780 (ICI, 100 nM)
effectively inhibited DERE copy increases elicited by E2 (see E2+ICI group).
Based on the above results, we hypothesized that prolonged exposure to estrogenic
chemicals contributes to DERE amplification. MCF-7 cells were used to determine whether
other estrogenic chemicals recapitulate estrogen-mediated gains of DERE copy (Hsu et al.,
2009 and 2010). Seven of the eight compounds examined, except bisphenol A (BPA),
demonstrated increases in DERE copies on 17q23 and 20q13 in a dose-dependent manner
(p<0.001; Figure 3C).
To determine whether this estrogen-driven DERE amplification occurs in breast stem/
progenitor cells, normal mammospheres harboring self-regenerating cells were exposed to
E2 or other aforementioned estrogens (Figure 3D, upper). We then measured changes of
DERE copy located on 17q23 and 20q13 in differentiated progeny without additional
estrogenic exposure. In two biological replicates, increased DERE copies were consistently
observed in epithelial cells pre-exposed to E2 or six of the eight compounds tested (p<0.01;
Figure 3D, lower). One possible explanation as to differences in drug response between
normal and cancer cells could be due to “U-shaped” dose-response curves in reaction to
particular drugs (Almstrup et al., 2002; Li et al., 2007; Vandenberg et al., 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Examining DERE copy number in the Integrative Cancer Biology Program (ICBP) panel of
46 breast cancer and 5 immortalized cell lines revealed that DERE copies were significantly
increased in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines compared to ERα-negative cancer and
immortalized lines (p<0.0004 in 20q13 and p<0.0186 in 17q23; Figure 4A, left).
Furthermore, ERα-positive luminal-A cell lines (Figure S3A–B, dashed red lines) appeared
to have on average higher DERE copies than those of luminal-B subtypes (dashed blue
lines). Quantitative PCR analysis of 105 clinical samples showed a similar DERE
amplification event in ERα-positive breast tumors (p<0.0118, Figure 4A, right). The clinical
relevance of these observations illustrated by a Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that
gains of 17q23 and/or 20q13 DERE copy were positively associated with reduced overall
survival in patients with ERα-positive breast cancer (p<0.0002, Figure 4B). In contrast, no
association between DERE amplification and survival was apparent in ERα-negative tumors
(p<0.6452; Figure S3C).

It was next of interest to investigate the association of genomic rearrangement with DERE
amplification in patient samples. We examined 17q23∷20q13, the most frequent structural
fusion in the MCF-7 genome, in 126 primary tissues using PCR analysis (Figure 4C, upper;
Table S4). This fusion fragment was detected in 15.1% (16 out of 106) of tumors, but not in
adjacent normal tissues (Figure 4C, see “All tumors” in bar chart). The majority of fusions
were found in ERα-positive tumors (13 out of 16), suggesting that ERα signaling activation
may contribute to both DERE amplification and the occurrence of 17q23∷20q13 structural
fusions. To determine whether aberrant epigenetic changes of DERE regions influence these
structural fusions in MCF-7 cells, we generated heat maps of DERE receptor binding
occupancy and DNA methylation in DERE receptor binding regions using the
aforementioned ChIP-seq data and our previously published MeDIP-seq data (Figure 4D)
(Hsu et al., 2010). We observed that DEREs occupied by ERα were frequently
hypomethylated compared with their flanking regions, which were hypermethylated.
Hypomethylated regions are known to be structurally unstable and prone to develop
breakage and fusion in cancer cells (You and Jones 2012).

Further in silico analysis identified 133 differentially expressed genes in three ERα-positive
cell lines (600MPE, MDA-MB-361, and ZR-7530) having fewer 20q13 DERE copies
(n<15) relative to three other cell lines (LY2, BT474, and MCF-7) with the highest copynumber gains (n>50) (Figure S3D and Table S9) (Heiser et al., 2009). Ingenuity Pathways
Analysis (IPA) suggested that TP53/BRCA1-related DNA damage response in LY2, BT474,
and MCF-7 cells enhanced this aberrant DERE copy increases (Figure S3E–F) (Mohr et al.,
2011). Up-regulated (e.g., NBN, DNMT3B, HLTF and NCOA3) and down-regulated (e.g.,
CYP286, SNCG, and RRAS) loci involved in this damage response pathway likely promote
DNA break-repair functions, leading to amplification of 20q13 DEREs in breast cancer cell
lines. This finding, therefore, provides a future opportunity to investigate the relationship
between DNA-damage regulatory pathways and DERE amplification in breast cancer.
Take together, these integrative results strongly indicated that 1) amplified DERE copies are
associated with the development of ERα-positive luminal breast cancer and poorer survival
in patients; and 2) this process is a general phenomenon in both normal and cancer cells
exposed to different estrogenic chemicals. We further suggest that ERα binding sites in
17q23 and 20q13 regions are highly susceptible to breakage and fusion, contributing to
genomic instability in cancer.
Amplified DERE Copies Regulate Target Genes through Long-range Chromatin
Interactions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To address the biological consequence of DERE amplification, we investigated the effect of
increased DERE copies on transcription of potentially oncogenic target genes using threedimensional interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D-FISH) analysis. A 3D-FISH
approach preserving nuclear architecture of MCF-7 cells showed that DEREs tended to
aggregate in 10–12 sub-nuclear locations (Figure 5A, right). In contrast, DEREs were
scattered into 50–60 spots in a “compressed” nucleus by traditional 2D-FISH (middle).
Consistent with the “transcription factory” concept (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009; Mitchell
and Fraser 2008; Osborne et al., 2007), DEREs located on different chromosomes might be
brought together to “sub-nuclear depots” for coordinate transcriptional control of multiple
genes. Upon binding by ERα, DEREs (Figure 5B, red lines) might reach out through
chromatin movement to interact with target genes while existing contacts (blue lines)
dissociate from target loci in E2-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Integrating our 3C dataset with a
published time-course study of gene expression in MCF-7cells (Cicatiello et al., 2010), we
mapped two groups of target genes, including 95 loci remotely interacting with 20q13
DEREs and 38 genes with 17q23 DEREs (Figure 5C). A time-course analysis independently

confirmed that 46 of these estrogen-responsive targets displayed down-regulated, upregulated, or cycling patterns of gene expression over a 24-hr period of E2 stimulation
(Figures 5D and S4A–B). These differential expression profiles regulated by DEREs,
however, were less obvious in normal breast epithelial cells stimulated with E2 (see
THRAP1 and ZIM2 as two examples in Figure 6B, blue line). Integration of our qPCR
results of DERE copy with a published expression microarray data (i.e., ICBP breast cancer
cell line panel; Heiser et al., 2009) further demonstrated that increased DERE copies
preferentially correlated with increased or decreased expression levels of E2-responsive
genes in 16 ERα-positive but not 30 ERα-negative cell lines (Figures 5E and S4C). Among
these ICBP cell lines, the LY2 cell line was an outlier with the greatest number of 17q23 and
20q13 DERE copies, which seemed to have little effect on target gene regulation. These
results indicate that ERα-bound DEREs remotely modulate transcriptional control of distant
genes through long-range chromatin interactions in estrogen/ERα-driven tumorigenesis.

Proliferation of ERα-positive Luminal Cancers

To confirm long-range transcription regulation by DEREs, we conducted functional analyses
of two selected target loci, THRAP1 (or MED13) and ZIM2. The rationale for choosing
THRAP1 was that its gene product is an integral component of the repressive Mediator
complex recently implicated in tumor growth (Monni et al., 2001; Knuesel et al., 2009).
ZIM2 was also selected because its biological functions have not been explored in breast
cancer. As a zinc-finger imprinted gene localized on 19q13, ZIM2 plays a regulatory role for
axon guidance signaling involved in pancreatic cancer development (Biankin et al., 2012;
Kim et al., 2004). We conducted chromosome conformation capture (3C)-qPCR assay to
examine whether DEREs located on 17q23 and 20q13 can remotely regulate THRAP1 and
ZIM2. In MCF-7 cells stimulated with E2 over a 24-hr period, inter-chromosomal
interactions were more frequently observed between DEREs located on 20q13 and the
THRAP1 gene (+0.2- and −2.9-kb flanking regions of TSS) and the ZIM2 promoter regions
(−1.7-, −4.2-, and −4.4-kb) (Figure 6A, left and right). Intra-chromosomal interactions were
also observed between 17q23 DEREs and THRAP1 gene-body regions (i.e., exon 13–14
regions located +52 and +48-kb from TSS), indicating cooperative efforts between different
DEREs in regulating gene expression (Figure 6A, left and middle). Inter- and intrachromosomal interactions associated with progressive down-regulation of the two loci in
E2-stimulated MCF-7 cells (Figure 6B, red line). However, siRNA knockdown of ERα
(Figure S5) markedly attenuated these inter- and intra-chromosomal interactions, abrogating
the time-course repression of these genes (Figure 6A–B, dashed-dotted red lines). Compared
to MCF-7 cells with 50~60 copies of amplified 20q13 segment (Figures 3A–B and 5A), the
effect of this chromatin-mediated repression was substantially less in normal breast
epithelial cells with only two copies (Figure 5A, normal epithelial cells). Upon E2
stimulation, chromatin interactions in normal cells were less frequent with only a slight
effect on gene repression (Figure 6B, blue line).
Since epigenetic changes are known to contribute to transcription repression and these longrange chromosomal interactions may lead to histone modifications in target regions (You
and Jones 2012), we determined genomic landscapes of three histone marks- H3K4me3,
H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the two loci using a
published dataset for MCF-7 cells (Joseph et al., 2010). Using THRAP1 as an example
(Figure 6C, left), E2 stimulation resulted in an increase in the H3K27me3 (red bar)
repressive mark occupancy on promoter region and simultaneously decreased Pol II binding
(green bar) at its transcription start site (TSS). A similar response was also observed at the
ZIM2 locus (Figure 6C, right). Upon E2 treatment, increased recruitment of repressive

To further investigate the biological significance of THRAP1 and ZIM2 in breast
tumorigenesis, proliferation of MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with either THRAP1 or
ZIM2 was monitored using the foci formation assay. THRAP1 or ZIM2 expression levels in
the transfected cells were confirmed using RT-qPCR analysis (Figure S6). Repressed
THRAP1 and ZIM2 by DEREs likely contributed to the observed E2-stimulated MCF-7 cell
proliferation (Figure 7A, MCF-7). This proliferation was greatly reduced by transient
expression of THRAP1 or ZIM2, suggesting that these two genes play tumor-suppressor
roles in ERα-positive luminal cancer cells (p<0.001; Figure 7A). In silico analysis of an
expression microarray dataset (Curtis et al., 2012) further confirmed down-regulation of
THRAP1 or ZIM2 in ERα-positive luminal-A tumors relative to other breast cancer subtypes
(p<0.05, Figure 7B). An inverse correlation between increased DERE copies on 20q13 and
down-regulation of these two genes was further observed (p<0.01; Figure 7C). Consistent
with these findings, estrogen-induced DERE copy gains possibly initiated in progenitors
chronically preexposed to estrogenic chemicals resulted in permanent expression changes of
THRAP1 or ZIM2 in the progeny (Figure 7D). Taken together, these results indicate that
DERE-mediated transcriptional regulation may result in repression of tumor suppressor
genes such as THRAP1 and ZIM2, leading to aberrant cell proliferation and tumor
progression.
Amplified DERE Copies Deregulate Anti-proliferation and Apoptosis Signaling Networks
Associated with Tamoxifen Resistance in Breast Cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We further examined whether altered expression of DERE-regulated genes associates with
adverse treatment outcome of ERα-positive breast cancer by surveying published expression
microarray data of multiple breast cancer cohorts (Hatzis et al., 2011; Symmans et al.,
2010). We found that differential expression of a subset (n=67) of DERE-regulated loci is
associated with patient relapse after endocrine therapies (Figures 8A–B and S7A–B).
Comparing gene expression profiles in a 298 patients cohort (Symmans et al., 2010), 40 of
the 67 DERE-interacting loci were significantly repressed in primary tumors from 71
patients, who subsequently developed local recurrence or distant metastasis after 5 years of
tamoxifen therapy (p<0.0001, Figure 8A). In contrast, only 27 of the 67 DERE-interacting
loci were up-regulated in those same patients (p<0.0001, Figure 8B). To validate the above
findings, 26 of the 67 DERE-regulated loci were randomly selected for gene expression
analysis in an ERα-positive BT474 breast cancer cell line, which is HER2-overexpressing
and resistant to tamoxifen (Wang et al., 2006). Increased crosstalk between ERα and HER2
pathways may contribute to endocrine resistance in this cell line. Estrogen stimulation
significantly induced differential expression of those genes in both MCF-7 and BT474 cells
while ICI attenuated E2-driven up- and/or down-regulation only in MCF-7, but not BT474
cells (Figures 8C–D and S7C–D). One possible explanation for this observation is that
HER2 may bypass the ERα blockade to regulate DERE-interacting loci in BT474 cells. An
alternative explanation is that despite the ICI treatment, high copy-number DEREs in BT474
cells may provide an additional ERα binding reservoir for partial transcription regulation of
these target genes (Figures S3A–B and S7C–D). An IPA approach further demonstrated that
these differentially expressed genes were mapped to several biologic pathways, including
cell cycle control (e.g., G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation and CDC42 signaling)
pathways (Figure 8E). Down-regulated genes belonged to signaling pathways such as antiproliferative somatosatin receptor 2 and SAPK/JNK signaling, which has been associated
with tamoxifen-induced apoptosis (Mandlekar and Kong 2001). Signaling cascades
modified by up-regulated genes included attenuation of Granzyme B-associated apoptosis,
leading to advanced luminal cancer development (Jiang et al., 2006).

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Genomic amplification in 17q23 and 20q13 regions is commonly observed in breast cancer
with poor prognosis (Andersen et al., 2002; Bilal et al., 2012; Ginestier et al., 2006).
Moreover, these amplification events have been implicated in endocrine therapy (Bilal et al.,
2012; Han et al., 2006; Symmans et al., 2010). Specifically, Han et al. (2006) reported that
chromosome 17q23 is among the most commonly amplified regions in breast cancer patients
whose tumors recurred within 5 years of post-tamoxifen therapy. It was previously
suggested that oncogenes located within these amplicons express high levels of
corresponding mRNA and proteins involved in cancer development and tamoxifen
resistance. As a result, identifying driver genes located within these large amplified regions
(4.5-Mb for 17q23 and 19-Mb for 20q13) was subject to intense investigations (Collins et
al., 2001; Han et al., 2006; Monni et al., 2001; Sinclair et al., 2003). However, systematic
screening of a total of ~148 genes in these regions identified only a handful of putative
oncogenes. For example, overexpression of ZNF217 and MAP3K3 located on 20q13 can
attenuate apopototic signaling, leading to chemotherapy resistance (Ginestier et al., 2006;
Santarius et al., 2010). In the 17q23 region, overexpression of RPS6KB1, TBX2, PPM1D,
RAD51C, and APPBP2 frequently associates with tumors displaying luminal or HER2
phenotypes (Bilal et al., 2012; Monni et al., 2001; Sinclair et al., 2003). One proposed
explanation for the low number of oncogenes associated with these amplified regions is that
selection of only a few oncogenic drivers is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in these cell
types. This process may be accompanied by amplification of neighboring genes as neutral
passengers (Ginestier et al., 2006; Sinclair et al., 2003).

In the present study, we offer an additional explanation that DNA regulatory elements
located within these genomic regions, such as DEREs, are co-amplified during breast
tumorigenesis. We suggest that increases in DERE copy number enhance ERα-modulated
transcriptional activity activated by E2, which is associated with induction of pro-growth
factors as well as repression of growth suppressing genes (Carroll et al., 2006; Fullwood et
al., 2009; Welboren et al., 2009). An integrative analysis of next-generation sequencing data
indicated that densely ERα-bound DEREs (46–51 per megabase) are localized in 17q23 and
20q13 regions. These ERα-bound DEREs interact with target genes outside the amplified
regions through long-range chromosomal interactions. Our experimental evidence further
reveals that the amplified DERE copies enhance the frequency of chromatin interactions in
breast cancer cells, markedly altering transcriptomic profiles of target genes involved in
cancer development. In silico analysis shows that these genes exist in a network associated
with apoptotic signaling pathways, such as the serine proteases, Granzyme B (Han et al.,
2005). The observed increase in the frequency of chromatin interactions between amplified
DEREs and target genes likely attenuate Granzyme B-induced apoptosis, thereby
contributing to advanced luminal cancer development (Jiang et al., 2006). Moreover, based
on differential expression patterns in tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 versus tamoxifen-resistant
BT474 cells (Figures 8C–D and S7C–D), we propose that amplified DEREs may deregulate
gene expression associated with anti-proliferation and apoptosis signaling networks that are
implicated in tamoxifen resistance. Although the estrogen-dependent transcription
mechanism may be blocked by tamoxifen, tumors containing high copy-number DEREs
may still have residual responses to estrogen-dependent growth compared to tumors with
low copy-number DEREs. As such, it will be interesting to interrogate in the future whether
high copy-number DEREs can be used as putative biomarkers for predicting patients’
intrinsic resistance to endocrine therapy.
In addition to the aforementioned findings, this study further demonstrates that amplified
DNA regulatory elements are caused by sustained stimulation of DERE-DERE interactions
(Figures 1, 2, and S2). In tumorigenesis, these amplified events may intensify chromatin

interactions (see two examples in Figure 6D), leading to inter- and intra-chromosomal
rearrangements. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying these chromosomal
amplifications in cancer remain to be fully explored, we anticipate that E2 stimulated,
DERE-mediated chromatin interactions may be a driving force of genomic instability. It is
well established that loss of genome stability and integrity is a hallmark of cancers, leading
to somatic copy-number alterations and non-random distributions of breakpoints (De and
Mochor 2011a; Hampton et al., 2009). Our results suggest that DNA breakpoints
preferentially cluster together at specific chromosomal regions previously implicated in
breast tumorigenesis, indicating that those regions harboring clustered breakpoints are
exquisitely prone to genomic rearrangements (De and Mochor 2011b; Hampton et al., 2009).
Furthermore, during neoplastic transformation, defects in double-strand break repair can
occur (Hampton et al., 2009), destabilizing these physical interactions and promoting
insertions and self-duplication of 20q13 DERE clusters, for example, into regions of seven
derivative chromosomes (Figure S2C–D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While our ChIP-seq and 3C-seq analyses point to amplification DERE-mediated
interactions, normalization to copy-number variation of DEREs is not presently conducted
for several reasons. First, the occurrence of ERα-binding events or the frequency of
chromatin interactions may not linearly correspond to increased DERE copies. Second,
while applying normalization to DERE copies relies on an assumption that all amplified
copies in a given DERE locus participate evenly in ERα-binding and associated chromatin
interaction, not all copies are expected to contribute equally to these events. Lastly, DEREmediated chromatin interactions are highly dynamic upon estrogen stimulation, irrespective
of their copy-number effect. Our ongoing study using Hi-C (an improved version of 3C-seq)
suggests that estrogen stimulation may lead to progressive increases and then decreases in
DERE interactions between 17q23 and 20q13 over a 24-hr period (data not shown)
(Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009). Therefore, the present analysis supports the concept that
estrogenic exposure drives genomic alterations involving chromosomal amplification of
distant estrogen-responsive regulatory elements. These genetic lesions persist in breast
progenitor cells, and when accompanied by altered gene expression profiles, possibly lead to
tumorigenesis. In addition, our data suggest that amplified regulatory elements in 17q23 and
20q13 can be used as potential prognostic markers for anti-estrogen resistance.

Breast Tissue Collection and In Vitro Exposure Model
Non-cancerous and cancer samples were collected by the tissue procurement service in
accordance with the protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Ohio State
University and had been de-identified prior to the analysis. For isolation of breast progenitor
cells, non-cancerous sections were obtained from individuals undergoing reduction
mammoplasties mainly due to macromastia. These tissues were dissociated mechanically
and enzymatically, and single cells were isolated and grown into progenitor-containing cells,
called mammospheres (2,000–10,000 cells per mammosphere), in ultra-low attachment
plates (Corning) with serum-free mammary epithelial growth medium (Cambrex) as
described (Dontu et al., 2003). Progenitor cells, repopulated in the suspension culture up to
six passages were then exposed to DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, Control), 17β-estradiol (E2),
or estrogenic chemicals in phenol red–free medium for 3 weeks (medium changed twice
weekly). After preexposure, progenitor-containing cells were placed on a collagen
substratum (BD Biosciences) in phenol red-free medium for 2–3 weeks without additional
exposure. Under these culture conditions, progenitors were differentiated into mature breast

epithelial cells as described previously (Hsu et al., 2009 and 2010). Six sets of biological
replicates were interrogated in this study. The MCF-7 and BT474 breast cancer cell line,
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were maintained in phenol red-free
medium. To minimize the effect of endogenous estrogen on each experiment, MCF-7 and
BT474 cells were cultured in media containing charcoal-stripped serum for 24 hr prior to
any short-term (a 24-hr period) treatment. For long-term exposure, cells were cultured in
charcoal-stripped serum condition with any treatment.
Library Preparation and Illumina Sequencing Processing of ChIP-seq, 3C-seq, and Matepair Seq
ChIP-seq, 3C-seq, and mate-pair seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina ChIP-seq,
paired-end, and mate-pair sample preparation kits, respectively, according to the
manufacturer. Libraries were validated using Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer and
then sequenced on Genome Analyzer IIx sequencer as follows: 3C-seq, 2 × 36-bp; mate-pair
seq, 2 × 51-bp; ChIP-seq, 1 × 51-bp. Detailed experimental description and data analyses are
provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analyses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All quantitative PCR results were presented as the mean ± SD of n independent
measurements. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made by Student’s t
test using SigmaPlot 11, and multiple groups were determined by ANOVA test. For samples
with equal variance, the paired Student’s t test was used. For samples with unequal variance,
the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test was utilized.

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Genomic amplification of 17q23 and 20q13 is a known prognostic factor in breast cancer.
Despite exhaustive search for oncogenic drivers within these genomic regions, only a
handful of putative oncogenes have been identified. By conducting integrative analyses,
we discover that densely ERα-bound DEREs localized in these regions may contribute to
breast tumorigenesis. Increased DERE copies enhance chromatin interactions, leading to
transcriptional repression of genes associated with tumor-suppressor and apoptosis
pathways. The increased frequency of chromatin interactions may be a relevant factor in
the development of a previously undescribed subtype of tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancer.

Figure 1. Integrative Mapping of ERα-mediated Chromatin Interactions Based on Nextgeneration Sequencing Approaches

(A) Integrative scheme of identifying ERα/DERE-mediated chromatin interaction sites in
E2-stimulated MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Chromosome conformation capture (3C)
assay coupled with paired-end sequencing was performed on both untreated (Ctrl) and
estrogen-treated (E2, 70 nM) MCF-7 cells to survey chromatin interaction events in a
genome-wide manner (STEP 1) (see also Figure S1A–B and Tables S1–2). To identify
genuine interaction sites, genomic fusions and self-ligated fragments mapped by mate-pair
sequencing were filtered-out from the 3C-seq dataset (STEP 2) (see also Tables S3–6). The
filtered data were then integrated with ERα ChIP-seq datasets (0 and 24 hr, respectively)

and distant estrogen response elements (DEREs) were mapped to define DERE-associated
chromatin interaction events (STEP 3) (see also Tables S7).
(B) Genomic distribution of ERα-mediated chromatin interaction sites. ERα-mediated
interaction sites mapped within 10-kb regions of DEREs, which have no known target
genes, were defined as DERE-DERE interactions. In the target loci category, the regions
within 10-kb upstream and 1-kb downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of a gene
were defined as promoters. “Others” were defined as ERα-mediated interaction sites
mapped in gene-desert regions.
(C) Circular visualization of ERα-mediated interactions upon E2 stimulation. Circular plots
depict interactive loci of different chromatin loops using the Circos software (http://
mkweb,bcgsc.ca/circos/). Chromosomes are individually colored. The locations of DEREs
are represented as lines outside the chromosomes “circle”. Four clustered DEREs were
identified in 1p13, 3p14, 17q23, and 20q13 regions (see also Figure S1C).

interactions in p and q arms of individual chromosomes were plotted. Purple arrows indicate
two major sites of DERE-DERE interactions on 20q13 and 17q23, respectively. See also

(D) Independent time-course analysis of 46 estrogen-responsive targets regulated by 20q13
DEREs. Total RNA isolated from E2-treated (70 nM) MCF-7 cells at different time-points
was subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Based on the data obtained from two
independent sets of experiments, four different patterns of gene expression were identified in
E2-treated MCF-7 cells. Data were summarized in a heat map and shown in 46 bar charts
with individual genes (see Figure S4A–B).
(E) Correlation analysis of DERE copy changes and DERE-regulated target gene expression
in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines (n=16). Expression microarray data of the ICBP cell
lines (Heiser et al., 2009) were integrated with experimental copy-number results to
interrogate the correlation between DERE amplification and transcriptional regulation.
Down- and up-regulated genes were identified from Figure 5C. See also Figure S4C for
correlation analysis in ERα-negative breast cancer cell lines (n=30).

Figure 6. Two Representative Examples of Amplified DERE-regulated Target Genes through
Long-range Chromatin Interactions

(A) Chromosome conformation capture coupled with quantitative PCR (3C-qPCR) analysis
of two target loci, ZIM2 and THRAP1. Cross-linked chromatin from E2-treated MCF-7 and
normal epithelial cells was digested with either BamHI or HindIII and then ligated under
diluted conditions. DEREs at 20q13 were designated as “baits”, and digested areas of two
candidate loci, ZIM2 and THRAP1, were “interrogated fragments”. Ligated DNA was
subjected to the 3C-qPCR. Data are shown as relative interaction frequencies compared to
those of GAPDH as an internal control. Mean ± SD (n=6).

(B) Expression analyses of THRAP1 and ZIM2 in normal breast epithelial cells (HMEC) or
cancer cells (MCF-7) in response to E2 (70 nM) determining using quantitative RT-PCR.
Cells with or without ESR1 (ERα) knockdown by siRNA were treated with E2 for the
indicated times. See also Figure S5 for the effect of siRNA on ESR1 expression.
(C) Genomic landscapes of histone modifications and Pol II occupancy on THRAP1 and
ZIM2 loci upon estrogen stimulation. A published ChIP-seq data including three histone
marks (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3) and Pol II was used to investigate the
occupancy of epigenetic marks on the two genes from −20-Kb upstream region of
transcription start sites to transcription termination sites (Joseph et al., 2010). Red bars,
increased occupancy; green bars, reduced occupancy.
(D) Proposed coordinate model of DERE-modulated chromatin interactions for
transcriptional regulation in response to estrogen. In normal cells, DEREs at 20q13 are
brought to THRAP1 (at 17q23.2) and ZIM2 (at 19q13.43), respectively, through chromatin
movement to repress expression. During tumor progression under continuous estrogen
exposure, genomic fusions and amplifications occur in the 20q13 DEREs attributed to
prolonged physical contact between DEREs in an unstable cancer genome. The DEREs from
20q13 are replicated and inserted into different chromosomes, leading to increased
interaction frequencies between DEREs and the respective gene loci, which profoundly alter
their transcriptional regulation.

Tamoxifen Therapy

(A–B) In silico analysis of DERE-regulated genes in an ERα-positive breast tumor cohort is
associated with relapse. A breast cancer cohort including a total of 298 patients with ERαpositive breast tumors and 5-year tamoxifen treatment was used to study the clinical
significance of DERE-regulated genes (Symmans 2010). Forty down-regulated (A) and
twenty-seven up-regulated (B) genes were significantly associated with relapse after
