Abstract
Promoter hypermethylation is one of the common mechanisms leading to gene silencing in various human cancers.
Using a combination of pharmacologic unmasking and
microarray techniques, we identified 59 candidate hypermethylated genes, including LOXL1, a lysyl oxidase-like gene,
in human bladder cancer cells. We further showed that LOXL1
and LOXL4 are commonly silenced genes in human bladder
cancer cells, and this silence is predominantly related to
promoter methylation. We also found LOXL1 and LOXL4 gene
methylation and loss of expression in primary bladder tumors.
In addition, somatic mutations were identified in LOXL4, but
not in LOXL1 in bladder cancer. Moreover, reintroduction of
LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes into human bladder cancer cells
leads to a decrease of colony formation ability. Further studies
indicated that the overexpression of LOXL1 and LOXL4 could
antagonize Ras in activating the extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Thus, our current study
suggests for the first time that lysyl oxidase-like genes can act
as tumor suppressor genes and exert their functions through
the inhibition of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway in human
bladder cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4123–9]

Introduction
With more than 120,000 new cases a year in Europe and the
United States, bladder cancer remains the second most common
genitourinary neoplasm and the fifth most common cancer in the
United States (1–3). Like other human cancers, loss of function of
tumor suppressor genes (TSG) and activation of oncogenes are two
major alternations that promote bladder cancer initiation and
progression. Gene mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are
well-known genetic changes leading to the inactivation of TSGs. In
recent years, the epigenetic change of gene promoter hypermethylation has been intensively studied and confirmed to be an

important molecular mechanism contributing to TSG inactivation
along with other genetic alternations in human cancer (4–6).
The significance in identifying novel gene promoter methylation
targets is 2-fold. First, methylated genes are potential candidate
TSGs. Subsequent investigation of the function of these methylated
genes could increase our understanding of tumor initiation and
progression. Second, the methylation genes could serve as
potential DNA markers for cancer diagnosis or even early detection
of cancer (6). Specifically for bladder cancer, the gene methylation
pattern, combined with the use of urine or serum samples, can be
an alternative method for cancer diagnosis and have profound
clinical applications (6–10).
There are numerous methods for large-scale screening for the
detection of methylated genes in the human genome. However,
most of them are either technically complex (restriction landmark
genomic scanning, methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis; refs. 11, 12), or they can only screen a small number
of genes (CGI array, arbitrarily primed PCR; refs. 13–16). Our
laboratory has developed a simple technique that combines
microarray and pharmacologic unmasking (5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine
treatment of cancer cells). This technique can screen up to 32,000
genes in one experiment and is now widely used in methylation
screening for all different types of cancers (17, 18).
In this study, we used this combination technique in bladder
cancer for the first time and identified 59 candidate hypermethylated genes. Among these genes, LOXL1, a lysyl oxidase-like
gene, has been further studied. We showed that LOXL1 and LOXL4,
but not other lysyl oxidase genes, are frequently silenced in human
bladder cancer cell lines, and that this silence is predominantly
related to promoter methylation. We further confirmed promoter
methylation and loss of expression of LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes in
human bladder tumors. We also found that in bladder tumors,
LOXL4 but not LOXL1 harbored somatic mutations and polymorphisms, which are clustered in exon 8 that encodes for the
scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain. Moreover, reintroduction of LOXL1 and LOXL4 could antagonize the oncogene
Ras in activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
signaling pathway in bladder cancer cells and NIH3T3 cells
containing an active Ras mutation. Finally, we found that LOXL1
and LOXL4 genes predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, and
overexpression of LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes leads to a dramatic
decrease of colony formation in human bladder cancer cells. All
together, our data indicate that LOXL1 and LOXL4 are potential
TSGs, and that their expressions are predominantly silenced
through epigenetic mechanisms in human bladder cancer.

Materials and Methods
Tissue sample and cell lines. Seven different bladder cancer cell lines
and one immortalized bladder cell, HUC1, were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection and cultured in recommended media. All bladder
tumor samples and matched adjacent normal tissues were from the Johns
Hopkins Hospital. The tissues were collected immediately after surgery and
kept in 80jC for long-term storage. The DNA was extracted using regular
phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The RNA was extracted using
TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 2 Ag RNA was used for reversal transcription
reaction.
DNA bisulfite modification and bisulfite sequencing. DNA bisulfite
modification was done using a protocol described previously (17). Briefly,
2 Ag DNA was denatured in 0.2 mol/L of NaOH for 20 min at 50jC. The
denatured DNA was then diluted in 500 AL of freshly prepared solution of
10 mmol/L hydroquinone and 3 mol/L of sodium bisulfite and incubated for
3 h at 50jC. The DNA was then purified through a column and suspended
in 100 AL TE buffer. Bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified using 10 PCR
buffer [166 mmol/L (NH4)2SO4, 670 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.8), 67 mmol/L
MgCL2, 0.7% 2 mercaptoethanol, 1% DMSO] and primer sets that were
designed according to sequence change after bisulfite treatment. The
sequences of the primers are shown as Supplementary Data S4. All PCR
products were sequenced with an internal primer using ABI big-dye cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems).
5-Aza-2¶-deoxycytidine treatment and reverse transcription-PCR.
Bladder cancer cells were treated with 5 Amol/L 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine
(5-Aza-dc) every 24 h for 3 days, TSA (300 nmol/L) was added for the final
24 h. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent. Reverse-transcription
reaction was done using single-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen).
Sequences of PCR primers are provided as Supplementary Data S4.
Exon-PCR and mutation analysis. Mutation screenings of 7 exons of
LOXL1 and 15 exons of LOXL4, including intron-exon boundaries, were
done by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of both strands for DNA
samples of all cells and tumors. The primers used for PCR and sequencing
analysis are described as Supplementary Data S5.
Plasmids construction and immunofluorescence. LOXL1 and LOXL4
full-length open reading frame sequence were amplified using cDNA with
high-fidelity enzyme. The PCR products were purified with gel purification
kit and directly cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-Topo vector using pcDNA3.1
Directional Topo Expression kit (Invitrogen). Positive clones were
confirmed by direct sequencing and Western blotting with anti-V5 antibody
(1:2,500; Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence assay was done using the
protocol described previously (19). Anti-V5 antibody (1:5,000) was used as
primary antibody, and Alex 548 anti-mouse antibody (1:800; Invitrogen) was
used as secondary antibody. Approximately 1 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 was
used for nucleus staining. The images were taken using a Zeiss confocal
microscope.
Colony formation assay. Cells seeded in six-well plates were transfected
with 1 Ag LOXL1, LOXL4, or pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-Topo vector. After 24 h,
cells were reseeded in 10-cm dishes with a density of 2,000 cells per dish and
5,000 cells per dish in the presence of G418 (500 Ag/mL) for 2 to 3 weeks.
Transfection and Western blotting. Cells seeded in 10-cm dishes were
transfected with 5 Ag LOXL1, LOXL4, and pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-Topo vector.
Cell lysates were collected after 48 h and blotting with either anti-V5
antibody to confirm the expression of LOXL1 or LOXL4 or anti–p-ERK
antibody. For 5637 cells, transfection was done with the same amount of
LOXL1, LOXL4, and HRAS G12V constructs. The enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the detection of signals.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using Student’s t test.

in gene expression were analyzed using microarray chips containing 12599 genes (Affymetrix U95Av2). Treatment with 5-Aza-dC
resulted in the up-regulation (defined as a 3.0-fold increase) of
more than 500 unique genes in each of the three cell lines. Among
them, 132 genes were reactivated by demethylation treatment in at
least two cell lines. We further examined the expression status of
these 132 genes in the expression profiles from normal bladder
tissue and the immortalized uroepithelial cell line, HUC-1. Fiftynine genes which showed abundant expression in normal bladder
tissue but were commonly silenced in at least two bladder cancer
cell lines were thus identified as specifically silenced genes in
bladder cancer (Supplementary Data S1 and S2).
Among these 59 genes, LOXL1 is of particular interest. LOX
was the first gene identified in this family and was confirmed to
be related to the Ras-induced cell reversion procession (20–22).
Recently, several family genes (LOXL1, LOXL2, LOXL3, and
LOXL4) were cloned and have been shown to possess various
functions, including developmental regulation, tumor suppression, cell motility, and cellular senescence (23, 24). We thus
hypothesized that LOXL1 and possibly other LOX gene family
members might be epigenetically silenced and act as TSGs in
bladder cancer.
LOXL1 and LOXL4 are the most frequently silenced genes in
the lysyl oxidase gene family in bladder cancer cells. To
confirm our hypothesis, we first did reverse transcription-PCR to
check the expression pattern of all family members in a panel of
bladder cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the loss of expression was
seen in six out of eight bladder cell lines for LOXL1 (75%), five out
of eight cell lines for LOXL4 (62.5%), and four out of eight cell lines

Results
LOXL1 is one of the candidate methylated genes identified
using pharmacologic unmasking and microarray techniques.
Three bladder cancer cell lines, SCaBER, T24, and UM-UC-3, were
treated with the demethylating agent 5 Aza-dC (5 Amol/L) for
3 days to reactivate genes that are epigenetically silenced. Changes

LOXL1, LOXL4: Potential TSG in Bladder Cancer

for LOX (50%). LOXL2 and LOXL3, however, retain their expression
in the majority of the cell lines. In contrast, all five genes retained
expression in normal bladder tissue, and three genes (LOXL1,
LOXL2, and LOXL3) also retained expression in HUC1 cells. We
therefore focused on the LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes because they
were the most frequently silenced in bladder cancer cell lines.
We next treated these cells with the demethylating agent 5-AzadC. Both LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes were robustly reactivated in all
the cell lines, which previously showed none or low expression of
these genes (Fig. 1B). We did not observe additional reactivation
effect with TSA (300 nmol/L) on these cell lines (data not shown).
In addition, we did direct bisulfite DNA sequencing to investigate
the promoter hypermethylation status of the LOXL1 and LOXL4
genes in human bladder cancer cells (Fig. 2A). We found that the

methylation pattern of these two genes perfectly matched their
expression pattern in human bladder cancer cell lines (Fig. 2B). All
together, our data clearly indicate that LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes
frequently lose their expression in human bladder cancer cell lines,
and that this silence is predominantly related to their promoter
hypermethylation status.
LOXL1 and LOXL4 are frequently hypermethylated and lose
expression in primary bladder tumors. We next investigated
LOXL1 and LOXL4 gene methylation in 64 primary bladder tumor
samples and 12 normal tissues using bisulfite sequencing. LOXL1
methylation was found in 42 out of 60 primary tumors (70%) and
4 out of 12 (33.3%) normal appearing controls (Student’s t test,
P = 0.037; Fig. 3A). LOXL4 was methylated in 26 out of 63 primary
tumors (40%), and no methylation was found in normal appearing
controls (Fig. 3B). All together, 58 out of 63 (92%) tumors displayed
either LOXL1 or LOXL4 methylation in their promoter regions,
and 10 out of 58 cases (17%) showed both LOXL1 and LOXL4
methylation (Fig. 3C).
We next checked the expression ratio in 14 cases of primary
bladder tumor samples and 6 cases of normal appearing tissues.
LOXL1 expression was lost or dramatically decreased in 7 out of 14
primary tumor samples (50%). Likewise, LOXL4 was found to have
low or no expression in 5 out of 14 cases (35.7%). Lost expression of
both of LOXL1 and LOXL4 was found in four cases. In contrast,
LOXL1 expression was retained in all six normal appearing tissues,
and only one case showed lost expression of LOXL4 (Fig. 4A).
We next checked the expression and methylation pattern of
LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes in four paired normal appearing tissues
and tumor samples. We found that LOXL1 lost expression in two
tumor samples compared with their normal appearing tissue,
whereas LOXL4 lost expression in one case of tumor, with another
case having a dramatic decrease in expression (Fig. 4B). We further
compared the methylation profile with the expression pattern. We
found that the two paired samples without expression change are
both unmethylated, whereas one case (1386) is methylated in
tumor (loss of expression), but not in the normal appearing tissue
(with expression). These data further support the notion that
methylation is the main mechanism leading to the loss of
expression of LOXL1 and LOXL4 in bladder cancer.
Somatic mutations were identified in LOXL4 but not in
LOXL1 in bladder cancer. To further evaluate whether there are
other genetic alterations in LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes in human
bladder cancer, we sequenced each exon of both genes in 8 bladder

cancer cells, 30 cases of normal appearing tissue, and 30 cases of
tumors. No somatic mutations were identified in all seven exons
of LOXL1. However, for LOXL4, we found an A1214C (exon 8)
heterogeneous polymorphism in 2 of the 8 cell lines and 10 of
30 normal and tumor DNA samples. In addition, homogeneous
polymorphisms in the same position were found in three other cell
lines and in five tumors, but not in the normal appearing samples.
Among these five, two cases have paired normal appearing tissues
(Supplementary Data S3). Thus, these homogeneous polymorphisms are possibly cancer related. In addition, two somatic

mutations, just two base pairs 5¶ of the polymorphism, were
identified in bladder tumors. T1212C leads to a nonsense mutation
(Asn404Asn), whereas T1212G leads to missense mutation
(Asn404Lys; Table 1; Supplementary Data S3). Notably, all the
polymorphisms and somatic mutations were located in exon
8 encoding for the SRCR domain.
LOXL1 and LOXL4 antagonize Ras activation of the ERK
signaling pathway in bladder cancer cells. Although the reverse
correlation of the LOX gene and ras oncogene was observed
20 years ago, no further studies were done to investigate the
mechanisms behind this phenomenon. Because we have already
found that LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes are frequently silenced and
methylated in bladder cancer, it was reasonable to hypothesize that
the overexpression of LOXL1 and LOXL4 can block Ras-induced
cell signaling in bladder cancer. We initially used the mouse
fibroblast NIH3T3 cells and ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells as a
model to test our hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 5A, ras-transformed
NIH3T3 cells have much stronger p-ERK expression than wild-type
NIH3T3 cells. We observed significant inhibition of p-ERK
activation when we transfected either LOXL1 or LOXL4, but not
their vector into ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5A).
We then checked the status of Ras and p-ERK in a panel of
bladder cancer cell lines (Fig. 5B). T24 and UM-UC-3 are two cell
lines harboring both a Ras mutation and an enhanced ERK
activation. 5637 and SW780 are two cell lines with wild-type Ras
with a dramatically low ERK activation. To check whether LOXL1
and LOXL4 genes can antagonize the Ras-activating ERK signaling
pathway in bladder cells, we cotransfected the Ras gene containing
the G12V mutation and LOXL1 or LOXL4 gene into 5637 cells
without detectable ERK activation. Mutant Ras alone can
significantly activate ERK signaling, and this activation can be
inhibited by both LOXL1 and LOXL4 reintroduction, with LOXL4
being less effective than LOXL1 (Fig. 5C).
Finally, we transfected LOXL1 and LOXL4 into J82 and UM-UC-3
cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5D, these two cell lines both have
enhanced ERK activation but with a different Ras status. We found
that LOXL1 can markedly inhibit ERK activation in both cell lines,
whereas LOXL4 can only marginally inhibit ERK activation in these
cells. Thus, consistent with the results from 5637 cells, LOXL1 and
LOXL4 have different capabilities in inhibiting the ERK signaling
pathway.

known for one function, the extracellular catalysis of lysine-derived
cross-links in fibrillar collagens and elastin (23, 26). We have shown
here for the first time that two novel members of this amine
oxidase family, LOXL1 and LOXL4, are frequently silenced, and this
silence is predominantly related to promoter hypermethylation in
human bladder cancer. Beyond that, LOXL1 and LOXL4 can inhibit
anchoring-dependent colony formation and can antagonize the Ras
effect in activating the ERK signaling pathway in bladder cancer
cells. Thus, our study indicates that LOXL1 and LOXL4 can serve as
TSGs in human bladder cancer. Recently, LOX was reported to be
methylated in human gastric cancer (26% by MSP; ref. 27). In
contrast to that report, we showed that LOX was not the most
frequent silenced LOX gene family member in bladder cancer.
Although the same promoter region showed hypermethylation in
human bladder cancer cells, we did not observe hypermethylation
of LOX in primary bladder tumors (data not shown). Thus, LOX
gene methylation might be restricted to some specific tissues.
It is of interest that we identified a homogeneous polymorphism
(A1214C) of the LOXL4 gene in five tumor cases but not in normal
tissue. Further study is needed to clarify whether this kind of
polymorphism is related to any pathologic characteristic of bladder
cancer. It is necessary to point out that all the polymorphisms and
somatic mutations were identified in exon 8 of the LOXL4 gene,
which encodes for the SRCR domain. SRCR domains are
conservative disulfide-rich extracellular domains shared by LOXL2,
LOXL3, and LOXL4, but not by LOX and LOXL1. They are also
found in several extracellular receptors and may be involved in
protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, Xu et al. (28) reported

LOXL1 and LOXL4 are predominantly located in the
cytoplasm and can inhibit colony formation in bladder cancer
cells. Lysyl oxidase has been shown to have both intracellular and
intranuclear locations in liver and kidney cells (23, 25). Until now,
the cellular locations, as well as the functions of the new lysyl
oxidase-like proteins in cancer cells, have not been studied. To
clarify whether LOXL1 and LOXL4 gene cellular locations are
consistent with their function to inhibit the Ras/ERK signaling
pathway, we transfected the LOXL1 and LOXL4 genes into the
bladder cancer cell lines J82 and 5637. The immunofluorescence
assay shows strong and predominant fluorescent signals in the
cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus for both genes in the two
different cell lines (Fig. 6A).
We next investigated the effect of reintroducing the LOXL1 and
LOXL4 genes into the bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-3, which
contains a Ras mutation and, accordingly, an enhanced ERK
activation (Fig. 6B). We found that both LOXL1 and LOXL4
expression can lead to a 40% to 50% decrease in anchoragedependent colony formation in UM-UC-3 cells. Similar results were
also obtained when we used the J82 cell line, which contains wildtype Ras but enhanced ERK activation (data not shown). Taken
together, these data indicate that LOXL1 and LOXL4 could serve as
TSGs in bladder cancer.

Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a copper-containing amine oxidase that
belongs to a heterogeneous family of enzymes that oxidize primary
amine substrates to reactive aldehydes. LOX has been traditionally

that two out of seven missense mutations located in the SRCR
domain of MSR1 (macrophage scavenge receptor 1) gene in
families affected with hereditary prostate cancer, suggesting that
germ line mutations and sequence variants of the MCR1 gene were
associated with prostate cancer risk. Taken together, the hotspot of
nucleotide change clustered in the SRCR domain might influence
the primary function of LOXL4 and MSR1 genes and lead to
alterations of downstream signaling pathways in bladder and
prostate cancer.
There is some controversy in the literature regarding the
function of the different members of the lysyl oxidase family in
human cancers. It was reported that LOX, LOXL1, and LOXL2 were
overexpressed in metastatic breast cancer. LOX-expressing MCF7
cells displayed increased invasiveness in an in vitro invasiveness
assay (29). LOXL2 overexpression was also reported to promote
tumor fibrosis and tumor progression in vivo (30). More recently,
LOX was reported to be essential for hypoxia-induced metastasis
(31). In contrast to the above, LOX levels are reduced in several
cancer cell lines as well as in ras-transformed cell lines (21, 32, 33).
The LOX gene was reported to be methylated in human gastric
cancer (27). Our current study indicates that at least two members
of the lysyl oxidase family, LOXL1 and LOXL4, can serve as TSGs in
bladder cancer. We believe that this kind of functional variation in
LOX family members is structure dependent and tissue specific.
On the one hand, all LOX and LOX-like proteins (LOXL1, LOXL2,
LOXL3, and LOXL4) have highly conserved copper-binding and
lysyl-trosylquinone cofactor sites (23, 24). There are also some
conserved domains such as multiple SRCR domains shared only
in LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 (34, 35). Thus, these structural
similarities and differences might account for their varied
functions in cells. On the other hand, it is not unusual that
different gene family members play different active roles in
different tissues due to the specific environment and different

upstream signals. TP53 is a well-known TSG, whereas the family
member DeltaNp63a is often overexpressed and oncogenic in many
tumor types (4, 36–40).
LOX was initially known as rrg (ras recision gene; ref. 20). In many
naturally occurring and oncogene-induced (ras) tumors, LOX is
down-regulated (21), whereas LOX is one of the main genes induced
in concomitance with the reversion process (22, 41). H-ras–
transfected NIH3T3, induced to revert by IFNh/g, would return to
their transformed phenotype upon transfection with an antisense
LOX. Until now, it has not been shown that the newly identified lysyl
oxidase gene family members (LOXL1 and LOXL4) can directly
inhibit the Ras/ERK signaling pathway. Giving the primary
importance of the ras gene in carcinogenesis, the Ras/ERK signaling
pathway has attracted considerable attention as a target for
anticancer therapy. Several major approaches have been undertaken
thus far: (a) the inhibition of Ras protein expression through
ribozymes, antisense, or micRNA; (b) the prevention of membrane
localization of Ras; and (c) the inhibition of downstream effectors of
Ras function such as the use of Raf kinase inhibitors and mitogenactivated protein/ERK kinase inhibitors (37, 42–44). Our current
study provides new evidence that LOXL1 and LOXL4 can antagonize
Ras function and inhibit the ERK signaling pathway in bladder
cancer. LOXL1 and LOXL4 status may thus be important in
determining sensitivity to the Ras/ERK signaling pathway inhibitors
in bladder cancer.
