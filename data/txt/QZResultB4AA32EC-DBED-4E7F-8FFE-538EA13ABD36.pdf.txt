Abstract
Docetaxel, an efficient chemotherapeutic drug, exhibits low and variable oral bioavailability due to the active
efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and more so to CYP3A4 gut metabolism. Using a spray-drying technique,
docetaxel was incorporated in PLGA [poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)] nanocapsules (NC) which were embedded in
entero-coated microparticles. An oral administration of the NC formulation elicited a higher absolute
bioavailability than both a docetaxel solution (276%) and a free docetaxel NC formulation (400%) injected
intravenously, a 5-mg/kg dose. The batches (B) I and II NC formulations elicited Cmax values that were 1,735%
and 2,254%, respectively; higher than the Cmax value of the oral docetaxel solution combined with blank
microparticles, a 10-mg/kg dose. No significant difference in AUC (area under curve) was observed between the
batches. These unexpected results can be explained only if the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel had been modified.
It was shown that NCs released from the microparticles penetrated the enterocytes, bypassing P-gp; apparently
circumventing gut metabolism and accumulating within the lymphatic system from where both intact or
biodegraded NCs and free docetaxel were progressively released into the circulation as plausibly supported by
the fluorescent imaging results. Furthermore, the circulating docetaxel in plasma was unencapsulated and
circulated either in free form or bound to albumin. Both free docetaxel NCs and microparticles exhibited in vitro
efficacy on WRC 256 cells suggesting that the activity of docetaxel was not altered. This delivery concept has
potential for clinical translation, perhaps allowing docetaxel chemotherapy to be switched from intravenous to
oral delivery. Cancer Res; 71(8); 3018–28. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Docetaxel is an anticancer drug widely prescribed for the
treatment of various cancers. The efficacy of a once-weekly
small dose regimen is comparable to a large dose given once
every 3 weeks yet with a lower hematologic toxicity profile
(1, 2). However, docetaxel administration is associated with
unpredictable and hypersensitive reactions, due, in part, to
polysorbate 80, the nonionic surfactant needed for solubilization (3). Efforts are being dedicated to find alternative polysorbate-free formulations for oral administration (4) offering
patient convenience, eliminating the risk of infection (intravenous catheters), and reducing hospital admissions. Further-

more, the oral route is more appropriate for chronic treatment
regimens (5). Unfortunately, docetaxel exhibits low and variable oral bioavailability due to active P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
efflux and CYP3A4 metabolism in the gut wall (6, 7). P-gp/
CYP3A4 inhibitors succeeded in improving docetaxel oral
bioavailability (8, 9); but, their clinical applicability is problematic because their administration often induces adverse
effects (10). By coadministering docetaxel with ritonavir,
which has CYP3A4- and P-gp–inhibiting properties (11, 12),
docetaxel oral absorption has been markedly improved as
recently confirmed in preliminary clinical studies (13, 14).
However, by combining 2 chemical entities, physicochemical
incompatibilities or formulation difficulties may arise. We
present a novel oral formulation containing docetaxel–PLGA
[poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)] nanocapsules (NC) embedded in
entero-coated bioadhesive microparticles, which significantly
improve oral bioavailability of docetaxel without affecting the
physiologic activity of the P-gp and CYP3A4.

hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Methocel E4M Premium or
HPMC) from Dow Chemical Company; and glyceryl tributyrate from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical. Oleoyl polyoxylglycerides
(Labrafil M1944 CS) and poly(methacrylic acid, Ethyl acrylate)
1:1 (EudragitL100-55) were donated by Gattefosse and Rohm,
respectively. Other chemicals and solvents were of analytic
reagent grade.
Methods
Preparation of NCs. The primary NCs were prepared by
dissolving in 100 mL of acetone: 1,500 mg of glyceryl tributyrate, 300 mg of Labrafil M 1944 CS, 300 mg of PLGA4K, and
180 mg docetaxel. With constant stirring, 70 mL of double
distilled water (DDW) were slowly added to the organic phase.
When needed, fluorescent NCs were prepared using identical
experimental conditions as with docetaxel but substituting
PLGA4K with NIR783-PLGA4K, the synthesis of which is
described in Supplementary Data.
Microencapsulation of the NCs. To prepare doublecoated NC formulations, a 200 mL sodium phosphate buffer
(5 mmol/L) was prepared; pH was adjusted to 6.5 by 1N NaOH
solution. An amount of 750 mg of Eudragit L were dissolved in
this solution maintaining pH at 6.5. A total of 100 mL of 1%
HPMC solution were added. The combined solutions were
added to the NC-dispersed mixture. The final suspension was
diluted to 500 mL with DDW and filtered through a gauze pad.
The PLGA suspension was spray-dried with a Buchi mini
spray-dryer B-290: inlet temperature 160 C, outlet temperature 98 C, aspiration 100%, pump rate 30% (8.4 mL/min),
nozzle cleaner 4 and air flow 601 L/h. The powder consisting
of NCs embedded in spherical microparticles was collected
and weighed.
Two separate identical batches, (B) I and II, were prepared
during September and December 2009, respectively, fully
characterized and evaluated in further animal studies.
Physicochemical characterization of NCs and
microcapsules
Docetaxel nanoencapsulation evaluation. Triplicate
PLGA NC suspensions (0.5 mL) were ultrafiltered using the
cell device, Nanosep (cutoff 30,000, centrifugation at 4,000 rpm
for 30 minutes). To estimate the amount of docetaxel in both
formulations, 1 mL from each was dissolved in 1.5 mL
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1 mL methanol and stirred
vigorously for 1 hour, centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 minutes. A
total of 250 mL of the solution or 200 mL of the combined
ultrafiltrates was dissolved in 1 mL of acetonitrile (ACN) and
the respective concentrations of docetaxel were determined
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as
described below.
Drug content in microparticles. Twelve milligrams of the
dried formulations were completely dissolved in 1 mL of
DMSO. Thereafter, 50 or 100 mL of the DMSO solution were
dissolved in 950 or 900 mL of ACN and this solution was
injected into HPLC accordingly. Mobile phase: 65% ACN
and 35% water; flow rate: 0.8 mL/min; wavelength: 230
nm; column: Phenomenex Luna 5-m C18 (2) 100 A 250 
4.60 mm, 5 mm.

A calibration curve was constructed from docetaxel concentrations ranging between 0 to 100 mg/mL yielding a linear
correlation (R2 ¼ 0.9976) with a limit of docetaxel detection of
0.25 mg/mL.
Measurement of particle size and zeta potential. We
measured NCs using an ALV Non-Invasive Back Scattering
High Performance particle sizer. Zeta potential measurements
were obtained using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern).
Morphologic evaluation
Atomic force microscopy studies. Microparticles were
dried overnight in a cover glass. Analysis was performed using
Scanning Probe Microscope Dimension 3100, Nanoscope V.
The topographic and phase images were obtained simultaneously.
Scanning electronic microscopy studies. Morphologic
evaluation of NCs and spray-dried microspheres was carried
out using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope
(Sirion, HR-SEM; FEI Company). The specimens were fixed
on a scanning electronic microscope (SEM) stub using doublesided adhesive carbon tape or alternatively, suspensions were
poured into a cover glass to evaporate the water medium.
After evaporation, standard coating by Au-Pd spattering
(Pilaron E5100) under vacuum made the specimen electrically
conductive. To evaluate the effect of incubation in 2 official pH
buffers, 10 mg of the formulation was soaked in 5 mL of PBS,
pH 7.4, or HCl/KCl, pH 1.2, USP (United States Pharmacopeia)buffered solution for 60 minutes at 37 C.
Animal experimentations
The animal studies were approved by the Ethical Committee of Laboratory Animal Care at The Hebrew University
of Jerusalem (MD-08-11329). Sprague Dawley male rats
(300–325 g) were used in all studies.
Pharmacokinetic study. Three groups of 4 rats were
randomly divided and were either injected in the jugular vein
a polysorbate 80 solution of docetaxel (Taxotere) or a dispersion of docetaxel–PLGA NCs, or orally administered docetaxel
NCs embedded in microparticles a single dose of 5 mg/kg.
Blood samples (300 mL) from the tail were collected in heparin
containing tubes at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours
and were immediately centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes,
after which 150 mL of plasma samples were transferred to new
tubes and stored at 80 C until analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS; Shimadzu
LC-20 HPLC system coupled with a Sciex Qtrap 3200 TurboIonSpray detector in positive ionization mode).
The assay was based on protein precipitation of docetaxel
and internal standard (IS ¼ paclitaxel) using ACN (100 mL
plasma sample mixed with 300 mL ACN containing IS).
Separation was carried out under reverse-phase conditions
using Phenomenex Synergi column (MAX-RP, 50  2 mm, 2.5
mm, 100 Å) in gradient mode (mobile phase A: methanol/
water/formic acid 20/80/0.2 and mobile phase B: methanol/
water/formic acid 80/20/0.2). Flow rate was maintained at 0.3
mL/min, and the column was maintained at 40 C. Detection
and quantitation were carried out by multiple reaction
monitoring with transitions from m/z 830.5 to 549.4 and

876.5 to 308.0 for docetaxel and IS, respectively. Tested
samples were quantified against a calibration curve in the
range of 5 to 500 ng/mL. The correlation coefficient values
were better than 0.990 indicating high linearity, accuracy,
and specificity.
Docetaxel absorption studies. Five groups of 4 rats were
used to evaluate the oral absorption and docetaxel blood
levels. They were fasted overnight with free access to water.
Taxotere (Batch D9A118, exp. no. 03/2012, kindly donated by
Sanofi-Aventis), was administered either intravenously or
orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg docetaxel (3.3 mg/rat). An amount
of 83.33 mL Taxotere was diluted in sterile saline to 0.5 mL and
injected into the jugular vein or dispersed in 2.5 mL DDW and
delivered orally. A third group of rats was orally administered
76 mg of blank NC formulation and 83.33 mL Taxotere
suspended in 2.5 mL DDW to determine the effect of blank
formulation on P-gp activity. Finally, 76 and 80.2 mg of
docetaxel-NCs BI and BII formulation, respectively, were
suspended in 2.5 mL DDW and delivered orally per animal.
Thirteen blood samples (400 mL) were collected and treated as
described above for up to 96 hours.
Determination of encapsulated and free docetaxel.
Three fasted rats were orally administered docetaxel NCs
formulation (BI) at a dose of 5 mg/kg. At time 0 (before
gavage) and 3 hours postadministration, blood samples were
collected, centrifuged, and plasma fractions (500 mL) were
immediately injected into the gel filtration column Sepharose
CL-4B (AKTAprime, apparatus equipped with fraction collector, UV, conductivity, and pH monitors; Amersham) eluted at a
flow rate of 1 mL/min of saline. The NCs and plasma protein
fractions were separately collected and tested for docetaxel
by LC-MS/MS following appropriate separation process
validations.
NC fluorescent labeling. Six groups of 3 rats, assigned to
time intervals of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 4, 8, and 24 hours were orally
administered the same dose of 10 mg/kg of docetaxel incorporated in the fluorescent NIR783-PLGA NCs embedded in the
microparticles (80 mg suspended in 2.5 mL of DDW). They
were shaved around the stomach area to increase near-IR
(NIR) signal intensity and anesthetized with an injected
ketamine (10%) and xylazine (2%) solution (1:9, respectively)
at a dose of 1 mL/kg. They were then scanned using MousePOD small-animal adaptor (LI-COR Biosciences) mounted on
top of the Odyssey instrument (15). During in vivo imaging, the
animal adaptor was maintained at 37 C. The animals received
a constant supply of fresh air. Fluorescent imaging allowed
monitoring of the biofate of fluorescent NCs in whole-animal
and specific exposed organs. Before surgery, the animals were
administered 1 dose of pentazocine (talwin) as an analgesic.
Following surgery, they were immediately euthanized and
tissue specimens, blood, plasma, stomach, intestine, liver,
heart, kidney, mesenteric lymph node, and spleen, were
exposed and monitored for imaging signal by the Odyssey
system. Appropriate time intervals between each animal were
allowed. Fluorescence value quantitation in mesenteric lymph
node and plasma was carried out following preliminary calibration and fixation of the scanning parameters in terms of
intensity, sensitivity, and focus. The quantitation of the fluor-

escent images was performed using the Odyssey version 3.0
image analysis program.
Walker carcinoma cell line in vitro experiments. The
effect of free and docetaxel-loaded NCs and respective microcapsules on Walker carcinoma cell line was examined. Walker
256 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC catalogue no. CCL-38) on July 2010, characterized by morphology and growth curve analysis by ATCC.
The cells were seeded at 105 cells/mL for 4 hours in M199
complete growth medium (M199 with 5% horse serum and
Pen-Strep solution). Docetaxel loaded in free NCs or NCs
embedded in microparticles or docetaxel in solution (DMSO)
were incubated for 72 hours at different concentrations from
0.1 to 50 mg/mL. The concentration of blank NCs was equivalent to the concentration of NCs loaded with docetaxel. The
cell viability was tested by MTT.
Statistical analysis. Differences were analyzed using
unpaired t test with Welch correction or 1-way ANOVA.
Analysis was determined: Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons test calculated by InStat software (version 3.01). The level
of significance was corrected using a posttest analysis.

Results
Evaluation of microparticles embedding docetaxel NCs
The average diameter and zeta potential values of the NCs
formed were 304, 293, and 352 nm and 54.4  2.3, 60.1 
4.3, and 37.7  3 mV for blank NCs and docetaxel-loaded BI
and BII NCs, respectively. The drug contents in the NC-loaded
microparticles were 4.34%  0.15% and 4.14%  0.12% w/w
for BI and BII, respectively. The morphologic properties of the
NC formulations were determined by SEM and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) techniques. In Figure 1A, most of the
microparticles from BII can be observed deflated with sizes
ranging between 2 and 5 mm. Furthermore, despite incubation
of 1 hour at pH of 1.2, the microparticles essentially kept their
original structure even though numerous NCs were exposed
(Fig. 1B). Following incubation at a pH of 7.4, the microparticles lost their outer coating and no defined structures could
be noted (Fig. 1C). The release of NCs, as a result of dissolution
of the microparticle polymeric shells, can be seen partly
embedded in matrix polymers that precipitated due to the
evaporation of the aqueous medium needed for SEM evaluation. The AFM results confirmed the SEM observations since
phase image analysis showed the presence of numerous
spherical NCs following incubation of 1 hour at pH of 7.4
(Fig. 1D).
The microparticles were designed to degrade at pH above 6
since they need to release docetaxel-loaded NCs. The stability
of docetaxel in the microparticles was therefore evaluated
using a validated HPLC method at pH of 7.4 and no degradation of docetaxel was observed over 8 hours.
Pharmacokinetic evaluation
Docetaxel plasma levels from 4 rats, for each formulation
in both pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are presented in
Figure 2. At 24, 48, and 96 hours of docetaxel plasma
concentrations were below the detection limit (less than

(AUC) and clearance (CL) values of the docetaxel solution
and injected NCs at a dose of 5 mg/kg were not significantly
different. The terminal (T1/2) value of docetaxel in solution
was significantly smaller than that in NCs. The oral administration of the same NCs in entero-coated microparticles
elicited a higher absolute bioavailability than both the
docetaxel solution (276%) and the docetaxel NCs (400%)
injected intravenously, whereas the T1/2 and CL values were
significantly smaller than those of the docetaxel solution and
NCs (Fig. 2A and Table 1). At a dose of 10 mg/kg, Taxotere
oral solution elicited an absolute bioavailability of docetaxel
of 5.5% (Table 2) confirming results reported in the literature. Furthermore, administration of docetaxel solution with
an equivalent quantity of blank microparticles elicited a
Cmax value of 132.5  120.4 ng/mL, well below those elicited

Docetaxel NC organ distribution
To elucidate the intestinal absorption route of the NCs,
fluorescent-labeled NCs were prepared and monitored by the
Odyssey system. Figure 3 shows the cumulative fluorescence
in the liver and spleen over time was not substantial but
reached the circulation (Fig. 4), whereas the fluorescence in
selected organs and more particularly the calculated meanintegrated intensities of the fluorescence in the mesenteric
lymph node and plasma increased with time, reached a
maximum and declined significantly over 24 hours (Fig. 5A
and B). Figure 4 illustrates that the circulating fluorescent NCs
remained partly intact for 8 hours as fluorescence was
detected in the blood and plasma but not in the hematocrit

suggesting that NC coatings did not biodegrade rapidly into
fragments that could be adsorbed or entrapped in the erythrocytes although the quenching or elimination of the fluorescence cannot be totally excluded. Similarities in the
calculated mean-integrated intensities of the fluorescence

(2–3 nm thick) were observed (transmission electron microscope, data not shown). A good reproducibility was achieved
between the batches. The difference in morphologic structures of the microspheric matrices as a function of pH is due to
the aqueous solubility properties of the polymers. While
HPMC is soluble in aqueous solution irrespective of pH,
Eudragit L dissolves only above pH of 5.5. The release of
the NCs should be attributed to the massive erosion of the
microparticle matrices due to complete dissolution of HPMC
and Eudragit L under pH of 7.4 conditions. Furthermore, SEM
evaluation of BI microparticles yielded similar morphologic
results and no difference could be detected between BI and
BII.
The injected NCs, 5-mg/kg dose, did not modify the in vivo
PK profile of docetaxel and suggested that the NCs either do
not accumulate in specific organs or immediately release
most of the docetaxel in the plasma, exhibiting a similar
profile as the docetaxel solution (Fig. 2A). Nonsignificant
decrease of 30% in absolute bioavailability and increase of
58% in the CL value of injected docetaxel NCs compared
with docetaxel solution were observed (Table 1). These

findings are similar to those published by Sparreboom and
colleagues (16) who suggested that the increase in the CL
value of the paclitaxel nanoparticles (NP) should be attributed to the presence of Cremophor in the Taxol formulation
which formed micelles and prevented paclitaxel from leaving
circulation and entering the tissues. Similarly here, the
presence of polysorbate 80 in the docetaxel aqueous formulation formed micelles and prevented docetaxel from
leaving circulation, whereas with the NCs following the
release of most of docetaxel in the plasma, the drug could
circulate freely since it was not incorporated within the
surfactant micelles.
Notably, 5 mg/kg is the maximum dose of docetaxel in NCs
for intravenous injection. At 10 mg/kg, NCs elicited marked
side effects probably due to the large amount of NCs in the
injected dose since the same docetaxel dose in solution was
well tolerated. The docetaxel-loaded NCs embedded in the
microparticles (10 mg/kg) increased the oral absorption of
docetaxel tremendously compared with the polysorbate–docetaxel solution alone or combined with the blank microparticles, confirming the findings observed with the 5 mg/kg
docetaxel dose (Table 1). Although AUC values for the 10-mg/
kg dose are presented (Table 2), they could not be compared
with the corresponding NC injected dose.

Oral Taxotere solution elicited low absolute bioavailability
confirming that the colocalization of P-gp with CYP3A in the
villous tips of the enterocytes provides a highly effective
barrier against systemic absorption of P-gp substrate drugs
including docetaxel (17,18). Thus, docetaxel is only administered intravenously in the clinic and is metabolized by
CYP3A to several metabolites that are all considered to
be therapeutically less effective (19, 20). Although a 6-fold
difference in Cmax and more than a 2-fold effect on AUC
values were noted in the presence of blank formulation
compared with those elicited by the polysorbate–docetaxel
solution alone, these values were not statistically different.
Nevertheless, the increase in Cmax values noted in the presence of blank formulation should be attributed to the
presence of numerous blank lipophilic oil cores that enhance
docetaxel solubility in the aqueous environment rather than
to the inhibition of the P-gp which leads ultimately to
significantly smaller values than those observed when ritonavir or cyclosporine were used to inhibit the pump (8, 11,
21). There are other pharmaceutical approaches being used
to increase docetaxel oral absorption. Cmax and AUC values
achieved by orally administering docetaxel microemulsions
to SD rats (10 mg/kg) were much smaller than
those achieved in the present study (22). Furthermore, NP

prepared with a polymer which inhibits P-gp efflux to
increase oral docetaxel absorption, achieved a 26.4-times
longer half-life than intravenous administration of Taxotere
at the same dose. One orally administered dose of the NP
formulation sustained docetaxel levels for almost 3 weeks
compared with 22 hours of intravenous administration of
Taxotere. Oral bioavailability was enhanced from 3.59% to
78% (23). In our case, we found no trace of docetaxel in the
blood after 24 hours. Thus, the biofate of the docetaxel NPs
remains unclear since the authors did not explain how their
NPs elicited docetaxel levels for so long (23).
The BI and BII formulations elicited Cmax values that were
1,735% and 2,254%, respectively, higher than the Cmax value of
the oral docetaxel solution combined with blank microparticles (Table 2). If we assume, excluding side effects, that the
injected 10 mg/kg corresponding docetaxel NCs exhibit a
similar PK profile as the 5-mg/kg dose, then the extrapolated
absolute bioavailability values of BI and BII were 665% and

3024

Cancer Res; 71(8) April 15, 2011

870%, respectively, compared with the docetaxel-injected
solution. These deductions should be carefully considered
since they are based on assumptions which need to be verified.
Statistical analysis of the data indicates that no significant
difference was apparent between the NC formulation batches.
Although the percent coefficient of variance (%CV) in AUC of
BII is high (around 50%), this variability is probably due to the
intrinsic batch properties and should not yet represent any
concern. It should be emphasized that the %CV in Cmax was
30%. We did not observe the same variability with BI. These
deviations can be considered reasonable taking into consideration that laboratory formulation process parameters are
better controlled and markedly improved during scaling up
and validation phases. Nevertheless, these observations suggest that the positive results achieved are formulation related
and merit further improvement and optimization. Additional
experimentation is warranted before making any firm
conclusions.

The unexpected enhanced absolute bioavailability achieved
with NC formulations at 5 and possibly 10 mg/kg of docetaxel
can be explained if the PK had been modified. Figures 3 and 4
demonstrate that NCs penetrated the enterocytes and entered
circulation, bypassing the normal pathway (lymphatic system), subsequently protecting the docetaxel from CYP enterocyte metabolism and systemic degradation.
It apparently could be deduced from the fluorescentlabeled NC monitoring that NCs accumulate within the
lymphatic system and from where both intact or biodegraded NCs and free docetaxel were progressively released
into the central compartment (Fig. 3 and 4). Figures 5C and
D support these findings: Figure 5C shows that NCs separated from plasma protein fractions even if a small peak is
observed in the free docetaxel plasma fraction probably
associated with the presence of chylomicrons; Figure 5D
indicates that practically all plasma-circulating docetaxel is
not nanoencapsulated (1,109 vs. 5 ng/mL). Unsurprisingly,
the docetaxel cannot be retained in the NCs when circulating in the plasma under infinite dilution since drugs incor-

www.aacrjournals.org

porated within NCs partition rapidly in favor of the releasing
medium when sink conditions prevail (24). This is further
supported by the extensive binding of docetaxel to plasma
albumin (25).
The higher T1/2 value noted with the NCs as compared with
the docetaxel solution (5 mg/kg) can be explained by the
residual NC docetaxel content of 5 ng/mL as it prolonged the
residence time in circulation (Fig. 5D). Dose data of 10 mg/kg
should be taken with precaution because it can be noted that
the behaviors between the 5 and 10 mg/kg doses differ
(Fig. 2B), probably because of the nonlinearity of docetaxel
PK properties. The rapid decline from 1,000 to 10 ng/mL,
within 4 hours (Fig. 2B), should be attributed to the complete
depletion of the reservoir effect in the lymphatic system.
Furthermore, the docetaxel circulating in plasma was unencapsulated and circulated freely or bound to albumin (Fig. 5C
and D). Thus, the terminal phase represents the rapid degradation/elimination of docetaxel in the plasma and differs from
Taxotere since it is unprotected by the polysorbate micelles
(25).

Clearance results also support these conclusions. Intravenously injected Taxotere elicited CL values of 5.11  0.75
L/h kg close to those of van Waterschoot and colleagues (7),
whereas the BI and BII NC formulations exhibited values of
0.59  0.23 and 0.67  0.25 L/h kg, respectively, showing
that docetaxel elimination was markedly reduced because of
the formation of an additional compartment in the lymph
system that progressively released encapsulated or free
docetaxel into plasma protecting the drug from CYP4A3
degradation effect. Docetaxel and NC release from the lymph
compartment was not markedly retarded since most of the
docetaxel was eliminated within less than 12 hours. This
kinetic deduction is also supported by the fact that NPs of
150 to 300 nm could not be eliminated or filtered intact by
the kidneys and consequently, their elimination process
should be different from the docetaxel elimination process
(26). Thus, for docetaxel to be eliminated within 12 hours
implies that the drug was released from the NCs in the
plasma as shown here. The presented data are indirectly
confirmed by van Waterschoot and colleagues (7), who used
a transgenic mice model lacking CYP3A and P-gp genes.
When orally challenged with docetaxel, a disproportionate
(>70-fold) increase in systemic exposure was observed compared with the drug increases in single CYP3A/ (12-fold)
or Mdr1a/1b/ (3-fold) mice, whereas in the present study,

NCs fraction

the trojan NCs increased the docetaxel systemic exposure by
more than 276% to 400%. The marked docetaxel enhancement exposure by the NC formulation suggests that NCs
both circumvent P-gp and protect the drug from CYP3A
intestinal and systemic metabolism. Despite exposure to
high docetaxel blood levels following oral administration,
the rats showed no side effects; neither losing weight nor
developing any visual lesions. We hypothesize that the NCs
were internalized intact in the enterocytes through an
endocytosis process (27), enhancing docetaxel absorption
and preventing damage to mucosal tissue that could be
elicited by high, free docetaxel molecule concentration.
With these findings, the question of cytotoxicity of docetaxel on Walker 256 carcinoma cell line was addressed. Figure
6A illustrates that the control microparticles elicited toxic
effects on the cells because of HPMC and Eudragit L that are
not approved for injection. However, the nanocapsulated
docetaxel microparticles exhibited more pronounced cytotoxic effects than blank microparticles, at least up to 5 mg/mL,
showing additional intrinsic cytoxic activity due to the presence and release of docetaxel. These results indicate that
docetaxel activity does not change following nanoencapsulation and embedding in the microparticles. It should be
emphasized that microparticles are not expected to come
in contact with cancerous cells since only the docetaxel NCs

should penetrate the enterocytes, reach the systemic circulation through the lymphatic system, and encounter them. Thus,
to mimic normal physiologic conditions expected following
treatment, the effect of docetaxel-loaded NCs on Walker 256
was evaluated (Fig. 6B). Cytotoxicity increased notably with
docetaxel-loaded NCs compared with the docetaxel solution,
whereas the respective blank NCs elicited a moderate lethal
effect at 5 mg/mL equivalent concentration (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the cytotoxic effect induced by blank NCs is probably
due to their penetration into the cells by an endocytosismediated process. These deductions are further supported by
the enhanced effect of the docetaxel-loaded NCs, with an IC50
improved value of 70% (4 mg/mL instead of 6.8 mg/mL)
confirming the marked toxicity of the docetaxel NCs.
In conclusion, the significant improvement in docetaxel
oral absorption should be attributed to the novel nanoplatform. This novel nanocarrier apparently behaves as a nanotransporter without markedly affecting the physiologic
activity of P-gp since the NCs penetrated the enterocytes
and masked docetaxel which reached circulation. The lymphatic route is involved in NC absorption therefore circumventing the first-pass effect and progressively releasing the

www.aacrjournals.org

encapsulated or free docetaxel into the plasma protecting
the drug from CYP4A3 degradation and retarding docetaxel
elimination. It was further shown that by incorporating
docetaxel into the innovative formulation, its intrinsic
activity remained unaltered since both NCs and microparticles exhibited in vitro efficacy on WRC 256 cells. The
efficacy of the orally administered NCs formulations in
different animal models is being addressed and is currently
under investigation.
