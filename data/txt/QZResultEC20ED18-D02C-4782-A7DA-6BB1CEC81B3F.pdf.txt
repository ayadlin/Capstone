ABSTRACT
Cardiac remodeling is one of the most common cardiac abnormalities and
associated with a high mortality in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients. Apocynin, a
nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor, has been
showed cardio-protective effects. However, whether apocynin can improve cardiac
remodeling in CRF and what is the underlying mechanism are unclear. In the present
study, we enrolled 94 participants. In addition, we used 5/6 nephrectomized rats to
mimic cardiac remodeling in CRF. Serum levels of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)
and its mainly metabolic enzyme-soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) were measured.
The results showed that the serum levels of EETs were significantly decreased in
renocardiac syndrome participants (P < 0.05). In 5/6 nephrectomized CRF model,
the ratio of left ventricular weight /body weight, left ventricular posterior wall
thickness, and cardiac interstitial fibrosis were significantly increased while ejection
fraction significantly decreased (P < 0.05). All these effects could partly be reversed
by apocynin. Meanwhile, we found during the process of cardiac remodeling in CRF,
apocynin significantly increased the reduced serum levels of EETs and decreased the
mRNA and protein expressions of sEH in the heart (P < 0.05). Our findings indicated
that the protective effect of apocynin on cardiac remodeling in CRF was associated
with the up-regulation of EETs. EETs may be a new mediator for the injury of kidneyheart interactions.

therapies for improving the prognosis of CRF patients,
cardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of death.
So to find out the key mediator and therapeutic strategies
remains urgent.
Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are the products
of arachidonic acids (AA) metabolized by cytochrome
P450 (CYP) epoxygenases. Our and previous studies
demonstrated that EETs could reverse cardiac remodeling
[3, 4]. However, it is still lack of direct evidence to show

INTRODUCTION
Cardiac remodeling has been demonstrated to be
a common cardiac abnormality in chronic renal failure
(CRF) patients and associates with a high cardiovascular
mortality [1]. It is showed that about 70%–80% end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) patients have manifestation of left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) [2]. Although hemodialysis
and peritoneal dialysis are effective replacement

that EETs could improve cardiac remodeling in CRF,
although we reviewed the possible mechanisms of EETs
to improve cardiac remodeling in CRF disease [5]. In
addition, previous studies mainly focus on the therapeutic
effects of EETs, whether EETs are a key mediator for both
cardiac and renal injury is still unknown.
Apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyacetophenone), an
inhibitor of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) oxidase, has been demonstrated to attenuate
cardiac remodeling through reducing oxidative stress
[6, 7]. In fact, apocynin is not a special inhibitor of
NADPH, it has role of anti-inflammatroy, reducing blood
pressure, ameliorating neuronal death, improving renal
injury, etc [8–11]. However, whether it has the effect on
regulating the metabolism of EETs and improves cardiac
remodeling in CRF are unclear. In the present study,
we hypothesized that apocynin could improve cardiac
remodeling in CRF and this effect may be associated
with the metabolism of EETs. EETs may be an important
mediator for the injury of kidney-heart interactions.

groups (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was
found among these three groups (Figure 1A). Similarly,
to exclude the influence of renal function, and explore
the role of cardiac function, we divided the participants
with no or little kidney damage (CKD stage 1 and 2) into
three different cardiac function groups depending on EF:
group 1 (EF ≥ 50%, n = 38), group 2 (50% > EF ≥ 35%,
n = 19), and group 3 (EF < 35%. n = 17). It was showed
that the levels of 14, 15-DHET decreased at the early stage
of HD and a slightly increase at the final stage of HD.
However, no significance was found among groups (P >
0.05) (Figure 1B). Then we investigated the combined
effects of renal and cardiac functions on the levels of 14,
15-DHET, the results showed that comparing with the
normal, RD and HD groups, the levels of 14, 15-DHET
were further reduced in RCS group (Figure 1C).

Apocynin improved cardiac remodeling in
nephrectomized (NE) CRF model
To mimic the cardiac remodeling in CRF, NE CRF
model was used. As presented in Table 2, after 8 weeks
surgery, the serum creatinine, the ratio of left ventricular
weight / body weight (LVM/BW), and the left ventricular
posterior wall thickness at diastole (LVPWd) were
significantly increased while the EF was significantly
reduced in NE group compared with that of sham-operated
group (P < 0.05). It indicated the renal function was
significantly decreased and there exited an obvious cardiac
remodeling in NE group. Moreover, comparing with shamoperated group, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were also greatly elevated
in NE group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, we found all the
above effects could be improved by apocynin treatment
except serum creatinine (Table 2). However, no significant
difference of heart rate was found among groups.
Figure 2A-2F further showed the cardiac remodeling
(cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis, respectively)
in different treatment groups. It was found that there had
an obvious concentric hypertrophy (Figure  2A-2B) and
cardiac interstitial fibrosis (Figure 2E) in NE group. And
the cardiac hypertrophy markers atrial natriuretic peptide
(ANP) and beta myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) and cardiac
fibrosis index cardiac collagen volume fractions were also
significantly increased compared with sham-operated
group (Figure 2C, 2D, 2F). However, all the effects of
promoting cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis could
be reversed by apocynin (Figure 2A-F).

RESULTS
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the
enrolled participants
A total of 94 participants were enrolled in this
study. According to the both renal and heart function,
we grouped the participants in to normal group, renal
dysfunction (RD) group, heart dysfunction (HD) group,
and renocardiac syndrome (RCS) group. The demographic
and clinical characteristics were showed in Table 1. As
seen from the table, the RCS group had higher levels of
serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), N-terminal
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), uric acid,
and C-reactive protein (CRP) than normal, RD and
HD groups. Simultaneously, the RCS group had lower
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), ejection
fraction (EF), superoxide dismutase (SOD), albumin,
and hemoglobin than other three groups. Moreover, the
significant overall differences were also found in age, the
serum levels of sodium, chorine, low density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-c), left atrium (LA), and left ventricular
end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) (P < 0.05, Table 1).

The levels of 14, 15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid
(DHET) decreased with reduced renal function
Depending on the eGFR, we grouped the
participants into five chronic kidney disease (CKD)
groups: CKD 1 (eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min, n = 35), CKD 2 (89 ≥
eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min, n = 13), CKD 3 (59 ≥ eGFR ≥ 30 ml/
min, n = 24), CKD 4 (29 ≥ eGFR ≥ 15 ml/min, n = 9),
and CKD 5 (eGFR < 15 ml/min, n = 13). We found that
CKD3 to CKD5 groups had significant lower levels of
14, 15-DHET comparing with that in CKD1 and CKD2

indicated that the expressions of cardiac sEH significantly
increased and apocynin prevented the up-regulation of
sEH in CRF. Moreover, we measured the serum levels
of 14, 15-DHET in different groups. It was showed that
the serum levels of 14, 15-DHET significantly decreased
in CRF while apocynin partly inhibited this effect
(Figure 3C).

insulin resistance, etc are all considered to be the
important mechanisms for the kidney-heart interactions
[5, 13, 14]. And in clinic, the drugs administration such
as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI),
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are also targeted to
these mechanisms. Apocynin, a commonly use inhibitor
of NADPH oxidase, can reduce oxidative stress induced
by angiotensin II, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
etc [13, 15]. So it is widely used in studies for its
antioxidation. Actually, apocynin is not a special NADPH
oxidase inhibitor, it also has antihypertensive effect and
anti-inflammatory [16, 17]. However, whether apocynin
can regulate the metabolism of EETs in CRF has not been
studied before. In the present study, we found apocynin
could improve cardiac remodeling in CRF and this effect
was associated with up-regulating the circulating levels
of EETs and decreasing the cardiac expressions of sEH.
It indicates that besides the antioxidation, regulating the
metabolism of EETs maybe a new underlying mechanism
for apocynin improving cardiac remodeling in CRF. And it
also importantly implies that EETs maybe new mediators
for the kidney-heart interactions.
EETs are the CYP-derived products of AA. There are
four EET regioisomers: 5, 6-EET, 8, 9-EET, 11, 12-EET
and 14, 15-EET [18]. Once EETs are formed, they are
quickly converted to the corresponding DHETs by sEH.
Elmarakby AA et al. and we both reviewed the therapeutic
role of EETs in kidney and heart [5, 19]. And EETs also
showed the mediator role for kidney-heart interactions.
There are several possible explanations for this viewpoint.
First, EETs were mainly produced by endothelial

Apocynin inhibited angiotensin II (Ang II)
induced expressions of sEH in
H9c2 cardomyocytes
To further demonstrate the influence of apocynin on
the expressions of sEH, we treated H9c2 cardomyocytes
with Ang II. The results also showed that apocynin could
decrease the mRNA and protein expressions sEH in vitro
(Figure 4A-4B).

DISCUSSION
The current study explored the role of EETs during
the process of apocynin improving cardiac remodeling
in CRF. We found that the levels of EETs decreased
with the reduced renal function (CKD stage 3 to 5). And
apocynin could improve cardiac remodeling accompanied
with up-regulating the levels of EETs and inhibiting the
cardiac expressions of sEH in CRF.
In CRF, the cardiac injury commonly exists and
this phenomenon is called RCS (Type 4 cardiorenal
syndrome) [12]. Oxidative stress, inflammation, reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) over activation,

cells [20]. EETs were identified as endothelium-derived
hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF) inducing dilation of
renal and coronary arteries [21, 22]. And this effect was
associated with lowering blood pressure which is a major
determinant of cardiac remodeling in CRF [23]. Second,
inflammation, RAAS over activation, oxidative stress,
etc are all exist under RCS condition [23] and all these
factors participates in influencing the production of EETs
[24–26].Third, EETs have autocrine and paracrine effects
both in cardiovascular and renal systems [27]. In CRF, the
uremic toxins may influence the affinity for EETs to bind
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to its receptor or inhibit its intracellular actions. However,
whether other possibilities can good explain the mediator
role of EETs for kidney-heart interactions are still need to
explore.
There are several limitations of the present
study. First, in vitro, the angiotensin II induced cardiac
remodeling model cannot completely mimic the CRF
condition, since a series of mechanisms are disorder in
CRF. Second, apocynin is an inhibitor of NADPH. So
cardiac remodeling reversed by apocynin in CRF was
partly attributed to its antioxidation [28]. Third, we only

in a priori approval by the Ethics Committee of Sun YatSen University.
Between January 2013 and Jun 2014, a total of 94
participants at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of Sun
Yat-Sen University were initially enrolled in this study.
23 were the healthy volunteers, and 71 participants
were patients. The healthy controls were recruited from
the health screening center of our hospital. They were
selected according to their self-reported medical history
based on their age and gender distribution. The patients
all had chronic renal and/or heart dysfunction. Besides the
symptom and signs, RD was mainly evaluated by eGFR
while the HD was mainly evaluated by echocardiography.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: age < 18 years,
acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemia
diseases, acute renal failure, kidney transplantation, severe
infection, severe hepatopathy, malignant tumor. According

used serum creatinine to evaluate renal function. Combing
other good markers such as albuminuria may be better to
evaluate kidney injury in CKD. Furthermore, in this study,
we did not explore the mechanism that EETs influence the
kidney-heart interactions.
In conclusion, the levels of EETs were decreased
in CKD stage 3 to 5, especially in RCS patients. The
protective effect of apocynin on cardiac remodeling in
CRF was associated with the up-regulation of EETs. EETs
may be a new mediator for kidney-heart interactions.

Echocardiography

to both the renal and cardiac functions, four groups were
divided: normal, RD, HD, and RCS groups. Moreover,
depending on the eGFR, we also grouped the participants
into five CKD stages: CKD 1 (eGFR ≥ 90  ml/min),
CKD 2 (89 ≥ eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min), CKD 3 (59 ≥ eGFR ≥
30 ml/min), CKD 4 (29 ≥ eGFR ≥ 15 ml/min), and CKD
5(eGFR < 15 ml/min). To exclude the influence of renal
function, and explore the role of cardiac function, we
divided the participants with no or little kidney damage
(CKD stage 1 and 2) into three different cardiac function
groups depending on EF: group 1, EF ≥ 50%; group 2,
50> EF ≥ 35%; group 3, EF < 35%.

Echocardiography was performed at 8 weeks
post surgery using M-mode and two-dimensional
measurements as described previously [31]. LA, LVPWd,
LVEDD, left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD),
interventricular septum depth (IVSd) and EF were
measured.

Histological analysis
After harvest, the hearts were fixed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. Tissue
sections of 4 μm thickness were prepared and stained with
hematoxylin/eosin (HE) and Masson trichrome (Beyotime
institute of Biology, Suzhou, China). The cardiac collagen
volume fractions were calculated as the ratio of aniline
blue-stained fibrosis areas to total myocardium areas
with Image Pro-plus 5.0 software (Mediator Cybernetics,
Bethesda, US).

Biochemical data collection and EETs
measurements
Blood samples from humans or Rats were drawn and
transferred into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) and then stored at −20°C before being
analyzed. Serum potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride,
magnesium (Mg), BUN, iron (Fe), glucose, hemoglobin,
albumin, uric acid, triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC),
LDL-c, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), CRP,
NT-proBNP, and SOD were measured using TBA-120 autoanalyzer (Toshiba Medical Systems, Japan).
Plasma levels of EETs were determined by gas
chromatographymass spectrometry with negative-ion
chemical-ionization using 14, 15-EETs/DHET Elisa kit
(Detroit R&D) [29]. The changed levels of 14, 15-DHET
indirectly reflects the changes of the levels of 14, 15-EETs.

Cell culture and treatments
The H9c2 rat cell line was obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Sanger Biotech, Shang
Hai, China). Cells were cultured in standard Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator with
5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were cultured in serum-free
DMEM for 24 h before treatment. Four groups were
divided: (a)  dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone, (1 μl,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, US) (b) apocynin (100 μM)
alone (c) Ang II (100 nM, Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, US)
(d) Ang II (100 nM)+apocynin (100 μM).

Animal model of CKD
Animal experiments were approved by the
Committee on Ethics of Animal Experiments, Sun
Yat-Sen University and conducted in accordance with
the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH
Publication No. 85–23, revised 1996).
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing
160–180g were obtained from Sun Yat-Sen
University. A two-step 5/6 NE model of CRF was used as
described in our previous study [28]. Rats were randomly
divided into three groups: sham-operated group, NE group
and NE+apocynin group. Rats in NE+apocynin group
were fed with 1.5 mM apocynin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
US) in drinking water [30]. 8 weeks after surgery, SBP,
DBP and heart rate of the animals were measured by a tailcuff method (BP-98A, Softron, Tokyo, Japan). Plasma was
obtained by tail vein at 8 weeks for determining the levels
of creatinine (model 7600–010, HITACHI automatic
analyzer, Tokyo, Japan) and 14, 15-EET levels (Detroit
R&D Inc.). Cardiac tissues were harvested at sacrifice for
histological and molecular investigations.

Quantification by real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from hearts or H9c2
cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) was performed as previously described [3].
The nucleotide sequences of the primers were shown in
Table 3.

Western blot analysis
Heart tissues or H9c2 cells were homogenized
in 250 μ of homogenization buffer using an electronic
stirrer. Protein concentration was determined with
BCA kit (Biocolors, Shanghai, China). The process of
western blot was used as previously described [32]. The
following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal
anti-sEH antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
anti-GAPDH antibody (Sigma) was used as an internal
loading control.
