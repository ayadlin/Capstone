ABSTRACT
Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is known to be overexpressed in
epithelial cancers associated with enhanced malignant potential, particularly colorectal
carcinoma (CRC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, it
is unknown whether progression of malignance can be directly inhibited by targeting
EpCAM. Here, we have generated five novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against
EpCAM. One of these anti-EpCAM mAbs, EpAb2-6, was found to induce cancer cell
apoptosis in vitro, inhibit tumor growth, and prolong the overall survival of both a
pancreatic cancer metastatic mouse model and mice with human colon carcinoma
xenografts. EpAb2-6 also increases the therapeutic efficacy of irinotecan, fluorouracil,
and leucovorin (IFL) therapy in a colon cancer animal model and gemcitabine therapy
in a pancreatic cancer animal model. Furthermore, EpAb2-6, which binds to positions
Y95 and D96 of the EGF-II/TY domain of EpCAM, inhibits production of EpICD, thereby
decreasing its translocation and subsequent signal activation. Collectively, our results
indicate that the novel anti-EpCAM mAb can potentially be used for cancer-targeted
therapy.

The first mAb ever used in human cancer therapy
was a murine IgG2a antibody (Edrecolomab; Panorex;
mAb 17-1A) directed against EpCAM [12]. Edrecolomab
was approved in Germany in 1995 as an adjuvant treatment
following surgical resection of primary colorectal tumors
[13, 14]. Subsequent larger studies, however, showed
edrecolomab to be inferior to established chemotherapy,
leading to the withdrawal of its market authorization. Since
then, several different immunotherapeutic approaches
targeting EpCAM have been developed by utilizing
monoclonal antibodies [10, 15], bispecific (trifunctional)
antibodies [16, 17], or conjugates with either toxins
[18] or Interleukin 2 (IL-2) [19]. The majority of these
antibody drug candidates have entered clinical trials for
cancer treatment [20], while Catumaxomab (trade name
Removab), a trifunctional bispecific mAb [16, 21], was
approved in the European Union (EU) in April 2009 for

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM;
CD326) is a 39 kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein,
encoded by the TACSTD1 gene (located on the long
arm of chromosome 2p21). EpCAM is known to be
overexpressed in epithelial cancers associated with
enhanced proliferation, invasion, metastasis, malignant
potential, chemo-/radioresistance, and decreased overall
survival of cancer patients [1–4]. Recent data suggest a
more multipotent role of EpCAM in cell-cell adhesion,
cell signaling, migration, and differentiation [5]. As it is
frequently highly expressed in tumor tissues and metastatic
cancer cells in transit via blood or lymphatic vessels
[3, 6, 7], EpCAM has gained attention as a potential target
for diagnostic and antibody-based immunotherapies for a
spectrum of malignancies [6, 8–11].

intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment of malignant ascites (MA)
in patients with EpCAM-positive carcinomas. Moreover,
subsequent data from clinical trials of other anti-EpCAM
antibody-based drug candidates, such as Edrecolomab
[9] and Adecatumumab (MT201) [10, 22], suggested
that anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibodies have only
limited anti-tumor effects, primarily through activation
of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [22, 23].
Adecatumumab (MT201), a fully human IgG1 monoclonal
antibody targeting EpCAM, has cancer cell-killing activity
that is independent of K-Ras status [24]. A phase II study
in patients with metastatic breast cancer confirmed the
overall safety and feasibility of single-agent treatment
with Adecatumumab [10]. At the time of writing, the
exact roles of EpCAM in carcinogenesis and malignant
progression have yet to be elucidated, and the low efficacy
of current anti-EpCAM drug candidates in clinical trials
highlights a need for the development of more efficacious
anti-EpCAM antibodies.
EpCAM, a polypeptide of 314 amino acids (aa),
contains an extracellular domain (EpEX) of 242 aa, a
transmembrane domain of 23 aa, and an intracellular
domain (EpICD) of 26 aa [25]. EpEX, which closely
resembles the fourth and fifth EGF-like motifs involved
in cell-matrix adhesion, is composed of two epidermal
growth factor-like domains (aa 27–59 and 66–135) and
a cysteine-poor region, while EpICD is a short sequence
[26]. However, the second motif does not represent an
EGF-like repeat, and instead resembles a thyroglobulin
(TY) type repeat [27–29]. TY type 1 domains are
conserved in a number of proteins and are capable of
binding, thereby inhibiting certain cathepsins (cysteine
proteases) involved in cancer progression [30, 31].
Whether EpCAM acts as a substrate or inhibitor of
cathepsins is not known. EpEX and EpICD are separated
through intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), a process that
is activated by TACE/ADAM17, a γ-secretase complex
containing presenilin 2 (PS-2) [32] and α-, β-secretase
[33]. Recent studies have shown that nuclear translocation
of EpICD allows it to function as a signaling transducer,
suggesting an important role for proteolytic cleavage of
EpCAM into EpICD and EpEX in EpCAM-mediated
malignant progression [32, 34]. Accumulation of EpICD
in the nucleus has been found to be associated with tumor
malignancy [34] and with undifferentiated embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) [35]. However, the exact mechanisms
by which EpCAM cleavage and EpEX signaling lead to
tumor malignancy are yet to be established.
EpCAM expression has been detected in certain
tumor initiation cells (TICs) [36, 37], suggesting EpCAM
as a possible target for enrichment of TICs and circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) [38–41]. TICs are considered to have
greater drug resistance and metastatic potential than nonTICs [42, 43]. Numerous studies have also confirmed
that TICs are present within a broad spectrum of cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

types, and that TICs have tumorigenic potential [44, 45].
However, in the absence of an effective biomarker with
high specificity, it is difficult to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms underlying TIC development, and to identify
an appropriate therapy against TICs. Hence, there remains
an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutics
against TICs/CTCs.
In this study, we generated five mAbs targeting
EpCAM, including EpAb2-6, which demonstrated a
unique capability to directly induce apoptosis in cancer
cells and to inhibit EpICD cleavage. This mAb is a
potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of CRC and
pancreatic cancer.

RESULTS
Generation and characterization of mAbs
recognizing EpCAM
We recently established a highly specific mAb,
OCAb9-1, against the cell surface protein EpCAM, and
found that EpCAM was highly expressed in SAS and
HCT116 cells. OCAb9-1 also specifically recognized
recombinant human EpCAM/Fc chimera (960-EP,
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn, USA) (Fig. 1A)
and several human cancer cells, but not normal cells.
OCAb9-1 was unable to induce cancer cell apoptosis; we
therefore attempted to develop pro-apoptotic antibodies
by generating a monoclonal antibody against EpCAM.
From more than 3,000 hybridoma clones, we identified
49 anti-EpCAM mAbs, five of which possessed high
binding activity to several human cancer cell lines (SAS,
NPC, HCT116, H441, MCF7, BxPC-3, and SKOV-3), but
not normal cell lines (HUVECs and NNM). The binding
affinities of these five anti-EpCAM mAbs are summarized
in Table 1A. Closer examination by Western blotting
(Fig. 1B), immunofluorescent analysis (Fig. 1C), and flow
cytometry analyses (FACS) (Fig. 1D) revealed that these
mAbs exhibited extremely high cell surface binding activity
to HCT116 and SAS cells, without showing any binding
activity to NNM cells. All of these mAbs have very high
affinity to EpCAM, with kinetic constants ranging from
10−9 ~ 10−13 (Table 1B). Western blotting (Fig. 2A) revealed
a dramatic decrease in EpAb2-6 after EpCAM knockdown,
thereby confirming the specificity of EpAb2-6 against
EpCAM.

The EpAb2-6 antibody inhibits the growth of
cancer cells
There are currently no published reports of an antiEpCAM antibody that can directly induce apoptosis;
here, we examined whether our newly generated antiEpCAM mAbs possessed this ability. Of the five novel
mAbs (Supplementary Fig. S1), EpAb2-6 was able to
induce apoptosis of SAS, SW620, HCT116, and HCT116

translocation, we examined the localization of EpICD
following treatment of HCT116 cells with EpAb2-6;
we report that EpICD localized to the membrane-bound
region of EpAb2-6-treated cells (Fig.  2E). Soluble
(cleaved) EpICD was observed in both the cytoplasm and
the nucleus of HCT116 cells treated with isotype control
antibody (Fig.  2E). The presence of soluble EpICD in
HCT116 cells was reduced after EpAb2-6 treatment, as
shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2F). Collectively,
these results suggest that EpAb2-6 may induce cancer
cell cytotoxic activity by inducing an apoptosis pathway,
and that EpAb2-6 inhibits EpICD nuclear translocation by
blocking the cleavage of EpCAM.

(TP53-/-), but not HCT116/shEpCAM or normal cell lines
(NNM)  (Fig. 2A and 2B, Table 2 and Supplementary
Figs. S2, S3A and S3B). Specifically, the percentage
of cell viability in stable clones expressing a firefly
luciferase shRNA (shLuc) was reduced to 34% after
EpAb2-6 (20 μg/ml) treatment for 48 hours. In contrast,
EpAb2-6 treatment of EpCAM knockdown cells resulted
in a smaller decrease (66% cell viability), illustrating the
inhibitory effect of EpAb2-6 on cell growth (Fig. 2C).
On the other hand, we found that EpCAM knockdown
decreased the viability of untreated cells (data not shown),
demonstrating that loss of EpCAM has negative effects
on cell survival in HCT116. In the non-attachment
cell death assay, HCT116 cells were treated with the
same dosage of EpAb2-6 for 2, 4, and 6 h, followed
by Western blotting analysis of PARP and caspase-3
cleavage. It was apparent that EpAb2-6 treatment led to
an increase in PARP cleavage levels and a decrease in
pro-caspase-3, compared to control IgG (Fig. 2D). We
previously reported that triggering EpICD cleavage and
its subsequent nuclear translocation are involved in cancer
initiation in TICs [34]. To determine whether EpAb2-6
inhibits EpICD cleavage and its subsequent nuclear

Identification of B cell epitopes of EpAb2-6
To identify the binding motif of the EpAb2-6
antibody, we sequenced DNA from 18 phage clones
that were highly reactive with this antibody, but less
reactive with normal mouse IgG. All clones were
found to contain 36 nucleotides (therefore encoding
12 amino acids). Peptide sequences were aligned using
MacDNAsis software, which revealed that the phage-

displayed LYD motif corresponds to amino acid residues
at positions 94–96 of EpCAM (Fig. 3A). To further
confirm that EpAb2-6 recognized the LYD motif in
EpCAM, we constructed cDNA sequences encoding the
first (aa 27-59; EGF-I domain) and second (aa 66-135;
EGF-II/TY domain) EGF-like repeat of human EpCAM.
PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was subsequently
used to introduce mutations into these domains (Fig. 3B).
Western blotting was used to determine the reactivity of
EpAb2-6 or EpAb3-5 antibodies towards these EpCAM
mutants (Fig. 3C). Amino acid mutations at positions
Y95 or D96 in the EGF-II domain of EpCAM caused
marked reductions in binding activity of EpAb2-6, but
not EpAb3-5 (Fig. 3C). However, amino acid mutations
at positions Q54, N55, Q89, N90, D92, G93, and L94 had
no effect on the binding affinity of EpAb2-6 to EpCAM
(Fig. 3C). We also established different EGF-like domain
deletion clones D1 (EGF-I domain deletion) and D2
(EGF-II/TY domain deletion) for immunoprecipitation.
Western blotting was used to demonstrate that EpAB2-6
does not bind clone D2 (Fig. 3D). Most importantly, these
lines of evidence confirm that EpAb2-6 binds to the EGFII/TY domain instead of the EGF-I domain. To further
elucidate the interaction of EpAb2-6 with EpCAM, we
built a molecular model to mimic the extracellular portion
of EpCAM (EpEx) based on previously reported crystal
structural information [51]. We also labeled the binding
epitopes of anti-EpCAM antibodies and the cleavage
sites of secretases [33, 52] (Figs. 3E and 3F). The ribbon
and surface models show that the binding epitope of
EpAb2-6 is different to that of the three anti-EpCAM
antibodies currently in clinical trials; i.e., edrecolomab,
ING-1, and adecatumumab. Interestingly, we found that
the epitope of EpAb2-6 is localized in the TY loop and
is very close to the cleavage site of β-secretase BACE1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Beta-site APP Cleaving Enzyme) (22 Å). It was recently
demonstrated that the release of EpICD from EpCAM
triggers proliferation- and stemness-enhancing signaling
in cancer cells [32, 34]. Moreover, the TY loop has
been reported to be critical for stabilizing cis-dimer
architecture of two EpCAM molecules, which mediate
cell-to-cell contact [51]. We therefore hypothesize that
the binding of EpAb2-6 may lead to steric hindrance
that disrupts cis-dimer formation of EpCAM and
inhibits cleavage of EpEx  by β-secretase. This in turn
compromises the release of EpICD, eventually leading to
cancer cell apoptosis.

In vivo tumor targeting of anti-EpCAM mAbs
Site-directed conjugation was used to specifically
couple antibodies to HiLyte-750 acid NHS ester via the
NHS functional group, thereby producing HiLyte-750
conjugated EpAb2-6 (EpAb2-6-HL750) or HiLyte-750
conjugated normal mouse-IgG (NM-IgG-HL750).
In vitro analysis indicated that EpAb2-6-HL750 can bind
to SAS and HCT116 cells with high affinity (Fig. 4A).
To determine the suitability of EpAb2-6 for use in tumor
imaging assays, we injected 5 nM EpAb2-6-HL750
and control (NM-IgG-HL750 or HiLyte Fluor™ 750
dye only) into mice bearing HCT116-derived colon
tumor xenografts. Mice and tissues were imaged using
a Xenogen IVIS 200 imaging system (Excitation:
710/760 nm; Emission: 810/875 nm) at the indicated
times. At 48 hours after injection, the near-infrared
(NIR) fluorescence signal intensity in the tumor tissues
of EpAb2-6-HL750-treated mice was significantly higher
than that of mice treated with non-conjugated HL750 and
NM-IgG-HL750 (Fig. 4B). We subsequently sacrificed and
anatomized the mice to investigate the tissue distribution

5.32-fold higher than that of non-conjugated HL750- and

These results indicate that EpAb2-6-HL750 exhibits high
levels of tumor binding.

with a combination of EpAb2-6 and IFL exhibited smaller
tumors than those in mice treated with IFL alone (*p < 0.05);
the tumors of the IFL group gradually increased in size,
becoming 1.6-fold larger than the tumors of the EpAb2-6 +
IFL group by day 25 (Figs. 5A and 5D). Body weight was
not significantly different between the two treatment groups

average tumor weight in mice treated with IFL was 0.23 g,
compared to 0.146 g in mice treated with EpAb2-6 + IFL
and 0.952 g in mice injected with PBS (Fig. 5C).
To further confirm that EpAb2-6 increases
therapeutic efficacy against colon cancer, we compared
the survival rates of tumor-bearing mice under different

respectively). However, no significant difference in
OS was observed between the IFL and EpAb2-6 + IFL

Combinatorial treatment of human colon
carcinoma xenografts with EpAb2-6 and IFL
Since EpCAM knockdown and EpAb2-6 treatment
disrupted cancer cell growth and induced cancer cell
apoptosis in vitro, we investigated whether EpAb2-6 could
be used to directly inhibit tumor growth in vivo. EpAb2-6
was shown to be able to inhibit the growth of human oral
and lung cancer (data not shown) in tumor-bearing mice.
Targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab, cetuximab, and
panitumumab, in combination with chemotherapy are more
effective than chemotherapy alone [53, 54]. Hence, there is
interest in developing targeted therapies based on EpAb2-6
for use in combination with IFL (irinotecan, leucovorin,
and fluorouracil). Mice with colon cancer xenografts treated

groups (log rank test p = 0.0972). Additionally, we
have used another cancer cell line, SW620, to further
demonstrate the therapeutic potential of EpAb2-6
through a double-blind experiment. SW620 is p53
mutation and less sensitive to IFL therapy [55]. The
results confirmed our previous finding in that EpAb2-6
in combination with IFL had higher therapeutic efficacy
at reducing tumor growth than IFL alone (Supplementary

the median overall survival of metastatic tumorbearing mice (Fig. 6). NOD/SCID mice were injected
intravenously with AsPC-1 cells. The median overall
survival of tumor-bearing mice treated with EpAb2-6
was significantly higher than that of PBS and isotypetreated mice (Fig.  6B). The median overall survival
times of AsPC-1-derived tumor-bearing mice after
treatment with PBS, isotype control IgG2a, and EpAb2-6
were 34, 34, and 47 days, respectively (Fig. 6B). The
difference in overall survival (OS) between the isotype
control IgG2a and EpAb2-6 treatment groups (as
determined using Kaplan-Meier curves) was found to
be statistically significant (log rank test p < 0.001).
PDA is among the most lethal human cancers, in
part because it is insensitive to many chemotherapeutic
drugs. Decades of studies have borne witness to the failure
of many chemotherapeutic regimens, and the current
standard-of-care therapy, gemcitabine, extends patient
survival by only a few weeks [59, 60]. To further verify
the therapeutic efficacy of EpAb2-6, we treated pancreatic
carcinoma metastatic animal models with a combination
of EpAb2-6 and gemcitabine. The survival rate of mice
treated with a combination of EpAb2-6 and gemcitabine
was found to be higher than that of mice treated with
gemcitabine alone. The median overall survival rates of
tumor-bearing mice after treatment with PBS, gemcitabine,
EpAb2-6, and EpAb2-6 + gemcitabine were 35, 43, 48,
and 54 days, respectively (Fig. 6D). The Kaplan-Meier
curve for overall survival (OS) of the group treated with
gemcitabine alone was significantly different to those of
the EpAb2-6 and EpAb2-6 + gemcitabine groups (log rank
test p = 0.0085 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig.  6D).
These results demonstrate that EpAb2-6 increases the
therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine against PDA.

EpAb2-6 increases the survival rate of mice
in colon and pancreatic cancer metastatic
animal models
Aggressive tumors with rapid growth often
metastasize by invading the surrounding tissue, and
they are always associated with poor prognosis. We
used a colon carcinoma metastatic animal model to
investigate whether EpAb2-6 treatment could increase
the median overall survival of metastatic tumor-bearing
mice. NOD/SCID mice were injected intravenously
with HCT116 cells; mice bearing circulating HCT116
cells were intravenously treated with EpAb2-6 or an
equivalent volume of PBS at 24 and 96 hours after cell
injection (antibody was delivered at 20 mg/kg/dose, for
a total dose of 40 mg/kg). The median overall survival
of tumor-bearing mice treated with EpAb2-6 (144 days)
was significantly higher than that of PBS-treated mice
(84 days; Fig. 6A). The difference in overall survival
(OS) between the PBS and EpAb2-6 treatment groups
(as determined using Kaplan-Meier curves) was found
to be statistically significant (log rank test p = 0.0078).
To further verify the therapeutic efficacy of EpAb2-6, we
treated colon carcinoma metastatic animal models with
a combination of EpAb2-6 and IFL. The survival rate
of mice treated with a combination of EpAb2-6 and IFL
was found to be higher than that of mice treated with IFL
alone. The median overall survival rates of tumor-bearing
mice after treatment with PBS, Isotype, IFL, EpAb2-6,
and EpAb2-6 + IFL were 68, 70, 92, 96, and 106 days,
respectively (Fig. 6C). Kaplan-Meier curves for overall
survival (OS) were significantly different between groups
treated with either IFL alone or EpAb2-6 + IFL (log rank
test p = 0.017) (Fig. 6C).
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is
among the most intractable of human malignancies,
with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 5–6%
[56]. Therefore, new approaches for the development
of more effective treatments for pancreatic cancer are
desperately needed. The EpCAM overexpression rate in
pancreatic primary tumors ranges between 33% and 60%
[57, 58]. Moreover, EpAb2-6 specifically recognizes
several human pancreatic cancer cells: AsPC-1,
BxPC-3, and PANC-1 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). We
found that EpAb2-6 not only induces AsPC-1 cancer cell
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4B), but also increases

Inhibition of cancer cell growth by humanized
EpAb2-6 (hEpAb2-6) antibody
EpAb2-6 exhibits high affinity and potent activity
for induction of cancer cell apoptosis, which suggests
it may have potential as a therapeutic antibody. Murine
mAbs have been shown to be of limited clinical use
because of their short serum half-life, inability to trigger
human effector functions, and the observation that they
induce a human anti-murine antibody (HAMA) response
(LoBuglio et al., 1989). To develop humanized mAbs,
we sequenced the VH and VL segments of EpAb2-6
from hybridoma cell lines. The CDRs of EpAb2-6 were
grafted onto a human IgG1 backbone to create humanized
EpAb2-6 (hEpAb2-6). The hEpAb2-6 construct was
expressed in CHO-K1 cells and purified from culture
supernatants. The hEpAb2-6 antibody, which maintained
the specificity of murine EpAb2-6 (mEpAb2-6),
recognized both SAS and HCT116 cancer cells, but not

Furthermore, in vitro studies using SAS and HCT116

These results suggest that EpAb2-6 has potential as a
therapeutic antibody for tumor-targeted drug delivery, and
imaging in cancer treatment.

Our study found that p53 expression is increased
by EpCAM knockdown [62]. Interestingly, EpAb2-6
also kills p53 mutant colon cancer cells (Table 2 and
Supplementary Figs S2 and S3), suggesting that this
antibody exerts its apoptotic effects through multiple
mechanisms, potentially involving both p53-dependent
and -independent pathways. Mutation or deletion of the
TP53 gene, which is associated with poor prognosis and
drug resistance, is observed in over 50 percent of human
tumors [63, 64]. This further highlights the importance
of EpAb2-6 in cancer treatment. EpICD, the intracellular
domain of EpCAM, has been reported to have a dominant
role in EpCAM signaling [32]. Recent studies have
reported accumulation of nuclear EpICD in tumor cells
[65], tumorsphere-derived xenografts, and tumor tissues
[34]. Blocking EpICD cleavage can prevent its nuclear
translocation, and suppress reprogramming factors and
expression of EMT genes [34]. In addition, Maaser et al.
[66] suggested that EpCAM is involved in cell cyclerelated signal transduction, which triggers intracellular
signaling pathways. Sankpal et al. showed that p53 can
bind to the EpCAM promoter to repress its activity [67].
Furthermore, recent studies have found that EpCAM
up-regulation can enhance reprogramming of induced
pluripotent stem cells by suppressing expression of p53
and p21, as well as maintaining the undifferentiated status
of ESCs through control of pluripotent gene expression
[35, 68]. In addition, it has been shown that c-Myc
overexpression abrogates p21CIP1-mediated repression
of EMT genes [69]. Other studies have shown that the
activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates EpCAM
expression, indicating that EpCAM may be involved in
the β-catenin-mediated self-renewal ability of tumor cells
[70]. In line with these findings, we found that inhibiting
EpCAM expression resulted in significantly higher levels
of p53 and p21 proteins (data not shown). However,
further investigation is required to elucidate the exact
mechanism underlying inhibition of TIC tumorigenesis.
EpCAM is frequently overexpressed and
functionally altered in malignant cells [6], including
TICs and CTC [41]. Although normal epithelial tissues
also express EpCAM, emerging evidence indicates
that within normal epithelial tissues, membrane-bound
EpCAM is largely sequestered within intercellular
boundaries. Therefore, EpICD is not subject to cleavage
in normal epithelial tissues, and it is also not observed
in the nucleus [32, 34]. Dynamic changes observed in
EpCAM expression have been linked to a changing tumor
cell microenvironment during cancer progression [71].
EpCAM-positive CTCs are associated with poor
prognosis, very low overall survival, and the presence of
lymph node metastases [71, 72]. In order to verify whether
EpAb2-6 has the ability to inhibit metastasis through
mechanisms other than ADCC or CDC, we subjected
cancer cells to non-attachment conditions to mimic

DISCUSSION
We have previously established that EpCAM
(specifically the EpICD) promotes tumorigenesis in TICs
through up-regulation of reprogramming genes and the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. The
release of EpEX may further enhance EpCAM cleavage
and trigger EpICD-mediated signaling in an autocrine or
paracrine manner, which would consequently promote
tumor initiation and progression [34]. Therefore, the
development of therapeutic antibodies, which target
EpCAM and/or inhibit EpICD activation, has great
potential for eradicating tumors.
In this study, we developed a monoclonal antibody
targeting EpCAM signaling and inhibiting EpICD
activation in cancer cells. Our results indicate that
EpAb2-6 can directly induce apoptosis in cancer cells by
increasing cleavage of PARP and decreasing pro-caspase-3
proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
describe an anti-EpCAM mAb that directly induces
cancer cell death by inhibiting EpCAM signaling, rather
than by acting through the ADCC or CDC pathways. We
also discovered that EpAb2-6 blocks EpICD cleavage and
inhibits nuclear translocation of EpICD (Fig. 2E and 2F).
Our results suggest that EpAb2-6 not only has potential
as a therapeutic antibody for TICs, but it is also suitable
for use in combinatorial treatment of CRC. Additionally,
the present findings indicate that EpAb2-6 is a suitable
diagnostic tool for the detection of CTCs and for early
diagnosis of cancer via in vivo molecular imaging.
The mechanisms by which anti-EpCAM antibodies
inhibit tumors in vivo remain unclear, due to inconsistent
results arising from the use of EpCAM-specific antibodies
as antineoplastic agents [61]. The antineoplastic effects of
the anti-EpCAM antibody require the immune response;
mAbs directed against EpCAM typically inhibit tumor
growth via anti-idiotype networks, including both B and T
cells, ADCC, and CDC death. Multiple trials assessing the
efficacy of anti-idiotypic antibodies against EpCAM have
achieved only marginal success [61]. No published study
has demonstrated direct induction of cancer cell apoptosis
by anti-EpCAM antibodies in a clinical setting, and so
it remains unclear whether such antibodies can directly
inhibit tumor cell proliferation [61]. In this study, EpAb2-6
was observed to directly induce apoptosis in HCT116 and
HCT116 (TP53-/-) cell lines in vitro (Fig. 2) and inhibit
CRC tumor growth (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3)
and metastasis (Fig. 6) in vivo. Our findings provide direct
evidence that our anti-EpCAM antibody is able to inhibit
tumor cell proliferation.

CTCs. The results revealed that EpAb2-6 can increase
the cleavage of capase-3 and PARP (Fig. 2D), thereby
confirming EpAb2-6′s potential as a treatment for CTCs.
Together, these findings suggest that EpCAM is required
for the survival of CTCs in cases of colon cancer.
Despite effective adjuvant treatment, many patients
experience disease recurrence and death from disseminated
disease. Thus, there is a need for more effective adjuvant
treatments for cancer. Colon cancer cells exhibit the
highest frequency of high-level EpCAM expression of
any cancer, with frequency >90% for any subgroup [6].
Such a high frequency of EpCAM expression on CRC
at all stages of the disease makes colon cancer an ideal
indication for anti-EpCAM-based therapies. The current
standard treatment for stage IV metastatic CRC involves
the use of a combination of chemotherapeutic agents,
including irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (IFL),
following surgical resection [73]. In stage III colon cancer,
adjuvant therapy with Edrecolomab plus Fluorouracilbased therapy had no statistically significant effect on the
overall survival of patients [74].
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly cancers,
largely because it is often not diagnosed until the disease
is at advances stages. Gemcitabine is the standard
treatment for advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer.
The use of gemcitabine to treat pancreatic cancer tissue
has had limited success, since it is poorly perfused and
vascularized, and triggers a desmoplastic response [75].
In the past few years, several trials have been performed
to investigate the efficacy of combination chemotherapy
or targeted therapy for the treatment of pancreatic
cancer, but no therapy resulted in strong enough results
to replace gemcitabine monotherapy as the standard
treatment [75, 76]. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy
of EpAb2-6 as a potential treatment for late stage colon
and pancreatic cancers, we treated human colon cancer
xenografts with either IFL alone or IFL in combination
with EpAb2-6. Additionally, we also treated a pancreatic
cancer metastatic animal model with either gemcitabine
alone or gemcitabine in combination with EpAb2-6. Our
results reveal that administration of EpAb2-6 not only
enhances the antitumor activity of IFL against CRC, but
it also increases the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine
against pancreatic cancer. Importantly, EpAb2-6 markedly
prolongs the median overall survival of metastatic tumorbearing mice (Figs 5 and 6). Hence, EpAb2-6 may
potentially increase the therapeutic index of the current
metastatic CRC and pancreatic cancer treatment regimens
when used in combination with IFL or gemcitabine.
While a plethora of antibodies target the welldescribed EGF-I of EpCAM, few are known to target the
surface-exposed regions of the TY and EpICD [51]. To
elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the inhibition
of tumorigenesis by EpAb2-6, we used phage display to
identify the B cell epitope of EpAb2-6: this revealed that
positions Y95 and D96 in the EGF-II/thyroglobulin (TY)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

repeat (EGF-II/TY) domain of EpCAM are recognized by
EpAb2-6 (Fig. 3). The ribbon and surface models show
that the binding epitope of EpAb2-6 is different from that
of the three anti-EpCAM antibodies currently in clinical
trials (i.e., edrecolomab, ING-1, and adecatumumab).
Interestingly, we found that the epitope of EpAb2-6 is
localized in the TY loop and is very close to the cleavage
site of β-secretase BACE1 (Beta-site APP Cleaving
Enzyme) (22 Å). A recent study demonstrated that the
release of EpICD from EpCAM triggers proliferationand stemness-enhancing signaling in cancer cells
[32, 34]. Moreover, the TY loop is known to help stabilize
the cis-dimer architecture of two EpCAM molecules,
which facilitate cell-to-cell contact [51]. We therefore
hypothesize that the binding of EpAb2-6 may lead to steric
hindrance, which disrupts cis-dimer formation on EpCAM
and inhibits cleavage of EpEx by β-secretase. This in turn
compromises the release of EpICD, ultimately causing
cancer cell apoptosis.
In recent studies, EpEx was shown to form a
cis-dimer corresponding to half of the proposed transtetrameric intercellular unit. The cis-dimer dimerization
interface between the two subunits involves the TY
domain [51]. TY domains are known for their potent
inhibitory effects on cathepsins, and their involvement
in metastasis and migration through the enhancement of
extracellular matrix degradation [20, 77]. Several studies
have investigated the role of EpCAM as a membranebound protease inhibitor, a function that may serve to
protect tumor cells from their own secreted cathepsins
during metastasis [20]. However, we have shown that
treatment with sEpEX (soluble EpEX) or transfection
with the EpEX gene promotes the cleavage of EpICD
and induces activation of reprogramming genes,
suggesting that EpEX cleavage may initialize EpCAM
signaling, and its release may further activate EpCAM
[34]. Maetzel et al. demonstrated that the shedding of
ectodomain resulted in the formation of sEpEX, which
is required as a ligand for EpCAM signaling [32].
Treatment of EpCAM-positive cells with a recombinant
EpEX induced EpCAM cleavage, which indicated that
soluble EpEX may provide cells with an autocrine or
paracrine signal after its initial release trigger, similar
to that of L1, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, and others [78–
81]. Therefore, the generation of inhibitors or antibodies
against EpCAM may facilitate the development of
tumor-targeting therapy (Figs 2, 5, and 6).
Based on our results, we propose that EpAb2-6
inhibits tumor growth through two pathways. The first is
direct induction of cancer cell apoptosis or inhibition of
EpCAM cleavage into EpICD and EpEX by binding to
positions Y95 and D96 of the EGF-II/TY domain (Fig. 3)
on intact EpCAM. The second is binding of EpAb2-6
to the neutralizing epitope on growth factor-like EpEX
(Fig. 3), which subsequently prevents EpEX from binding
24960

Oncotarget

to an unknown receptor. This in turn prevents the cleavage
of EpCAM (Fig 2E and 2F). By inhibiting the cleavage of
EpCAM, EpAb2-6 prohibits tumor growth by preventing
the translocation of EpICD into the nucleus (Fig. 2F),
thus preventing the binding of EpICD to a multiprotein
complex consisting of FHL2, β-catenin, and Lef-1, and
thereby blocking both the down-regulation of p53 and
p21, and the activation of EMT and iPS genes.
The present study demonstrates that EpCAM may
be a promising target antigen for the development of
cancer therapy. EpAb2-6, which recognizes a particular
epitope on EpCAM, can directly induce cancer cell death
and may be a suitable basis for devising treatments for
colon and pancreatic cancer.

Pittsburgh, PA). The antibody-conjugated affinity columns
were washed with PBS. The EpCAM proteins were
eluted with elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL) and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.1. The
purified EpCAM protein was used to immunize mice for
generation of mAbs against EpCAM. Anti-EpCAM mAbs
were generated following a standard procedure [48], with
slight modifications [49]. Briefly, female BALB/cJ mice
(6-week-old, National Laboratory Animal Center (NLAC),
Taipei, Taiwan) were immunized intraperitoneally with
EpCAM protein four times at 3-week intervals. On day 4
after the final boost, splenocytes were harvested from
the immunized mouse spleen and fused with NSI/1Ag4-1 myeloma cells using 50% polyethylene glycol
(GIBCO, CA, USA). Fused cells were suspended in
DMEM supplemented with hypoxanthine-aminopterinthymidine (HAT) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and hybridoma
cloning factor (ICN, Aurora, Ohio), and were then plated
onto 96-well plates. These hybridomas, which were
positive for HCT116 and SAS but negative for NNM,
were then subcloned by limited dilution, before being
preserved in liquid nitrogen. Ascites were produced in
pristane-primed BALB/cJ mice, and mAbs were purified
using a protein G Sepharose 4G gel (GE Healthcare
Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). The protocol was approved
by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of
Academia Sinica (AS IACUC: 11-04-166).

of NNM was approved by the Human Subject Research
Ethics Committee, Institutional Review Board, Academia
Sinica (AS-IRB01-06008). Human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased (Lonza,
Walkersville, MD) and cultured in EBM-2 media (Lonza,
Walkersville, MD). The human oral cancer cell line SAS
was obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research
Bioresources (Tokyo, Japan). The cells were cultivated in
Dulbecco modified Eagle’s media (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% FBS, at 37°C with 5% CO2. Other cell lines were
purchased from ATCC and were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 5%
or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), at 37°C in a humidified

For Western blotting, cells were extracted using
RIPA buffer (0.01 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mM
NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40,
1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).
Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE
and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore,

with 4’, 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI 1:500).

absorbance (A) at 570 nm was then recorded using a
Spectra® Max M5 Series (Molecular Devices). Cellular
viability was calculated as (Asample − Ablank) / (Acontrol

three times, with triplicate samples for each experiment.

Non-attachment cell death assay
Cells were plated at 5 × 102 per 25T flask in 4 ml
growth media at the indicated time points. The cells were
subsequently incubated on a shaker at 130 rpm at 37°C
in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells in suspension
were collected and washed with 1 × PBS, and were then
lysed in RIPA buffer for subsequent protein analysis by
Western blotting.

Flow cytometry
SAS, HCT116, and NNM cells were dissociated
with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (1 mM) (Invitrogen) for
1–3 min. Cells were washed with cell sorting buffer (PBS
containing 1% fetal calf serum), and then incubated for
1  hour at 4°C in cell sorting buffer with anti-EpCAM
mAbs at dilutions ranging from 0.00001 to 1 μg/ml. Cells
were then incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at 4°C. After a
final wash, the cells were re-suspended with 1% FBS in
PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD, San Jose, CA).

phage display
The phage display biopanning procedures were
performed as described previously [50]. Briefly, an ELISA
plate was coated with mAb at 100 μg/ml by incubation
at 4°C for 6 h. After washing and blocking, the phagedisplayed peptide library (New England BioLabs, Inc.)
was diluted to a concentration of 4 × 1010 pfu, and
incubated for 50 mins at room temperature. After washing,
bound phage was eluted with 100 ml of 0.2 M glycine/
HCl (pH 2.2) and neutralized with 15 ml of 1 M Tris/
HCl (pH 9.1). The eluted phage was amplified in ER2738
(New England Biolabs, Inc. MA, USA) for subsequent
rounds of selection; the phage was then titrated on LB/
IPTG/X-Gal plates. The biopanning protocols for the
second and the third rounds were identical to the first
round, except for the addition of 2 × 1011 pfu of amplified
phage. The immunopositive phage clones were identified
by ELISA, and then sequenced with the -96 primer
5′-CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG-3′ (this primer
corresponds to the pIII gene sequence of M13 phage). The
phage-display peptide sequences were translated using the
ExPASy Proteomics Server and aligned using MacDNAsis
software.

Apoptosis assays
Cells were separately seeded and treated with
0–20  μg/ml mAbs for 6 hours; an unrelated mouse
myeloma immunoglobulin served as the IgG2a (Invitrogen
#02-6200) isotype control at an appropriate dilution.
Apoptotic cells were detected using Annexin V-FITC
and PI, and were analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD
immmunocytometry systems, San Jose, CA). Early
apoptosis was measured with the Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection kit II (BD Pharmingen, La Jolla,
CA). Apoptotic nuclei were detected with propidium
iodide (PI) staining.

MTT assay
The effect of EpAb2-6 on cell viability was assessed
using MTT assays (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide;
Sigma, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
To perform the MTT assay, cells were mixed in the
presence of increasing concentrations of EpAb2-6 (1, 2,
4, 8, 12, 20 μg/ml), in a final volume of 150 μl 2% FCS
culture media. The same concentration of IgG was used
as a control. The serially diluted EpAb2-6 antibodies or
control IgG were then plated onto flat-bottomed 96-well
plates at a density of 5 × 102 cells/well. After 48 h of
incubation, 1 μl of MTT reagent was pipetted into each
well of the 96-well assay plate to a final concentration of
5 μg/ml (wells contained 100 μl of fresh phenol red-free
culture media). The plate was then incubated for 2 h at
37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere, and media
were subsequently replaced with 150 μl of DMSO. The

Use of EpCAM mutants to identify the B-cell
epitope of EpAb2-6
Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate
EpCAM mutants, using the recombinant expression
plasmid pcDNA™ 3.1/V5-His. PCR was performed
using pfu ultra DNA polymerase (MERCK), and all
mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing.
HEK293 cells at 80–90% confluency in 6-well plates
were transfected with plasmids encoding various EpCAM
mutants. After two days of transfection, the cells were
washed with PBS. Cells were extracted with RIPA buffer,
supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture tablet,
and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The wild24962

type and mutated recombinant proteins were stained by
incubating with 1  μg/ml primary antibody (EpAb2-6
or EpAb3-5), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Labs, West
Grove, PA). The signals were developed using enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents (ECL) (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL).

monotherapy groups. Mouse body weight and tumor
size were measured twice a week. Tumor volumes were
calculated using the equation: length × (width)2 × 0.52 and
presented as standard error of the mean. This study used
humane endpoint by determining the tumor size (>10%
of body weight) or mouse weight loss (>20% of body
weight). Mice were observed twice a week and were given
a soft diet. Animal care was carried out in accordance with
the guidelines of Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The protocol
was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of Academia Sinica (AS IACUC: 11-04-166).

Construction of an EpCAM deletion mutant
PCR-amplified human EpCAM was cloned into
pcDNA3.1-v5-His, and the EGF-like domain I (amino
acids 27 to 59) and II (amino acids 66 to 135) of fulllength EpCAM were removed using PCR-based gene
deletion. Each construct was confirmed by DNA
sequencing. Primer sequences used for PCR mutagenesis
are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Colon and pancreatic cancer metastatic
animal model
HCT116 colon cancer cells (1 × 106 cells/mouse)
were injected into 6-week-old female NOD/SCID mice
(Jackson Laboratory) through the lateral tail vein. Mice
were then treated with PBS and EpAb2-6. The dosage
was 20 mg/kg on days 1 and 4. Mouse body weight and
survival rate were measured twice a week (n = 10). For
EpAb2-6 monotherapy, EpAb2-6 was delivered at a dose
of 20 mg/kg through the tail-vein by intravenous (i.v.)
injection once a week for 5 weeks. IFL was administered
by intravenous (i.v.) injection once a week for 5 weeks.
AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells (1 × 106 cells/mouse)
were injected into NOD/SCID mice through the lateral
tail vein. Mice were then treated with PBS, isotype
(IgG2a), or EpAb2-6. The dosage was 20 mg/kg
on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Mouse body weight and
survival rate were measured twice a week (n = 10). For
EpAb2-6 monotherapy, EpAb2-6 was delivered at a
dose of 20 mg/kg through the tail-vein by intravenous
(i.v.) injection once a week for 5 weeks. Gemcitabine
monotherapy at 80 mg/kg was administered by
intraperitonel (i.p.) injection once a week for 5 weeks.
Mice were monitored every day and given a soft diet
to decrease the suffering of the mice. For the study
of mouse survival, tumor size was not appropriate for
use as a humane endpoint. Instead, humane endpoints
were decided based on mouse weight loss (>20% of
body weight) or mouse activity assessment (hunching,
stationary, ruffling, and poor grooming). Animal care
was carried out according to the guidelines established
by Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The protocol was approved
by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments
of Academia Sinica (AS IACUC: 11-04-166).

Synthesis of EpAb2-6-HiLyte-750 conjugated
(EpAb2-6-HL750) and imaging
EpAb2-6 or NM-IgG (600 μg) were incubated with
HEPES solution containing 20 nmole HiLyte Fluor™ 750
acid NHS ester (HiLyte-750) (AnaSpec) at 4°C overnight,
in order to conjugate HiLyte-750 to the mAb via the NHS
functional group. EpAb2-6- HiLyte-750 conjugated was
purified using a NAP-10 column with HEPES buffer.
The concentration of HL750 was determined using a
spectrofluorometer and interpolation from a standard
curve. The mice were randomly divided into three groups
(3 mice in each group), for intravascular injection with
control (HiLyte Fluor™ 750 dye only), NM-IgG-HL750,
or EpAb2-6-HL750. Fluorescence imaging was performed
using Xenogen’s IVIS® 200 imaging system (Excitation:
710/760 nm; Emission: 810/875 nm) at the indicated
times.

Animal model for analysis of antitumor efficacy
NOD/SCID mice were obtained from the Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) and were bred in
the core facility of the ICOB at Academia Sinica. Mice
of 4–6 weeks old were injected subcutaneously in the
dorsolateral flank with 2 × 106 HCT116 cells. Mice with
size-matched tumors (approximately 50 mm3) were then
randomly assigned to different treatment groups, and were
injected with EpAb2-6 only, IFL only, EpAb2-6 plus IFL,
or equivalent volumes of saline through the tail vein. For
EpAb2-6 monotherapy, EpAb2-6 was delivered at a dose
of 20 mg/kg through the tail-vein by intravenous (i.v.)
injection twice a week for 4 weeks. For IFL monotherapy,
IFL (fluorouracil at 25 mg/kg + leucovorin at 10 mg/kg +
irinotecan at 10 mg/kg) were administered by i.v. injection
twice a week for 4 weeks. For combination treatment,
EpAb2-6 was administered 24 hours before IFL; EpAb26 and IFL were administered at the same dosage as the

transcribed using oligo (dT) as a primer in a ThermoScript
RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The variable heavy- and
light-chain domains (VH and VL) were amplified from
the cDNA product by PCR with a variety of primer sets
(Dubel et al., 1994; Orlandi et al., 1989; Orum et al.,
1993). The PCR products were cloned using the TA kit
(Promega, Madison, WI), and the VH and VL sequences
were determined by DNA sequencing. Software Vector
NTI (InforMax) was used for sequence analysis. From
these sequences, the framework regions (FR) and
complementarity-determining regions (CDR) were
analyzed through comparison with those found in the
Kabat database and with alignment to sequences in the
ImMunoGeneTics database (Lefranc et al., 2009).

Construction and expression of humanized
EpAb2-6
Humanized EpAb2-6 VH consisted of the modified
FR1 to FR4 from the accession DI164282 gene, and
the CDR1 to CDR3 of EpAb2-6 VH, respectively.
The humanized EpAb2-6 VL CDRs consisted of the
modified FRs from the accession GM882764 gene and
the CDRs of EpAb2-6 VL. The resulting VH was cloned
into modified expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen)
with a signal peptide and human IgG1 constant region.
The VL was cloned into modified expression vector
pSecTag (Invitrogen). The VH and VL plasmids were
cotransfected into CHO-K1 cells and selected using G418
and puromycin for 2–3 weeks. Transformed cells were
subjected to limiting dilution in 96-well plates. After two
weeks, stable clones produced humanized antibody in
McCoy’s 5A medium (Sigma-Aldrich), and were identified
by ELISA. Humanized antibodies were produced by
CELLine AD 1000 (INTEGRA Biosciences, Switzerland),
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
