Growth Factor Receptor Dependency

Abstract
Cancer cells harboring MET amplification display striking sensitivity to selective small molecule inhibitors
of MET kinase, prompting their clinical evaluation. Similar to the experience with traditional therapeutics,
most patients responding to treatment with such molecular targeted therapeutics ultimately relapse with
drug-resistant disease. In this study we modeled acquired resistance to experimental MET kinase inhibitor
PF2341066 in MET-amplified non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines to identify drug resistance
mechanisms that may arise in clinic. We found that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) pathway emerges as a resistance mechanism in MET-amplified cells after prolonged exposure to
PF2341066. Whereas combined inhibition of MET and EGFR kinases in MET-dependent NSCLC cells did
not enhance their initial sensitivity to PF2341066, this combination dramatically suppressed the eventual
emergence of drug-resistant clones after prolonged drug exposure. Conversely, activation of the EGFR
pathway increased the yield of PF2341066-resistant clones, confirming the significance of this pathway in
conferring resistance. Our findings support an intimate relationship between the EGFR and MET signaling
pathways in NSCLC, and they suggest that combination treatment with MET and EGFR kinase inhibitors
may be beneficial in MET-amplified NSCLC by reducing selection for drug resistant clones. Cancer Res; 70(4);

Introduction
Many human receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) mediate
signals that promote proliferation, migration, and survival of
cancer cells. Consequently, RTKs have been long recognized
as potentially important targets for the development of cancer
therapeutics, and ∼30 distinct kinase inhibitors have been developed thus far to the level of Phase I clinical evaluation (1).
The clinical success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as
erlotinib and imatinib, has prompted intensive efforts to
identify and target additional oncogenic kinases as a broad
therapeutic strategy for selected patient populations (2–5).
Focal amplification of the MET gene, which encodes the
MET RTK, is detected in a subset of solid tumors—most no-

tably, gastric and non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
cancers (6, 7). In NSCLC cell lines, amplified MET is associated with active MET kinase and consequent engagement of
established MET effectors, such as AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2; ref. 8). Furthermore, MET
kinase inhibition in MET-amplified cancer cells results in decreased cancer cell viability in cell culture and xenografts
models, suggesting that MET TKIs may be clinically effective
in patients whose tumors harbor MET amplification (8–11).
Consequently, MET TKIs are currently undergoing earlyphase clinical testing as anticancer agents.4
Although the clinically approved TKIs can yield impressive
responses in a subset of treated cancer patients, rapidly acquired drug resistance remains an important limitation to
the long-term efficacy of such treatments (12–15). Therefore,
it is critical to establish mechanisms of drug resistance and
to apply that knowledge to the development of strategies to
combat resistance (13, 16–18). One such strategy is to treat
tumors with a combination of agents that might prevent the
emergence of drug-resistant cells by anticipating specific
mechanisms of resistance that might otherwise arise in the
context of single agent–based therapies.
Here, we established preclinical findings suggesting that

cells is associated with either a partial or complete switch to
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)–dependent
signaling to maintain tumor cell survival. Despite the absence of any detectable sensitivity to EGFR TKIs in these
NSCLC cell lines, combined MET/EGFR kinase blockade
dramatically suppresses the emergence of drug-resistant
clones, pointing to a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce the likelihood of relapse in the treatment of NSCLC
patients with MET-amplified tumors and highlighting an
intimate relationship between MET and EGFR signaling
in NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Human cancer cell lines and cell viability assays. The
EBC-1 and NCI-H1993 cell lines were from the Japanese
Health Sciences Foundation (JHSF) and the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), respectively, and cultured according to their recommendations. COR-L 105 cells were from the
European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. EBC-1 cells
were authenticated by JHSF using short tandem repeat
DNA profiling. ATCC has not published a DNA STR profile
for NCI-H1993, so a sample was sent to the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute for single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis
and comparison with their cancer cell line collection. The
only match was with NCI-H1993 in that collection. COR-L
105 cells were similarly genotyped by the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute and found to match their COR-L 105 stock
and no other lines. All cell lines were obtained directly from
each repository and passaged for fewer than 6 mo after receipt. All drug-resistant clones were removed from drug for a
minimum of 10 d before undergoing cell viability assays. Cell
viability was measured as previously described (10). In brief,
cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and incubated in the
fluorescent DNA-binding dye Syto-60 (Invitrogen) before
analysis on a fluorescent plate reader. Sensitivity to drug
treatment was calculated as the fraction of viable cells relative to untreated cells after a 72-h exposure. Data were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad
Prism Software version 5.2 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) to
obtain IC50 values.
Generation of PF2341066-resistant clones. Drug-resistant
clones of the PF2341066-sensitive MET amplified NSCLC cell
lines EBC-1 and NCI-H1993 were established by exposing
these cells to increasing concentrations of PF2341066 for
3 mo. Clones capable of proliferation in a final concentration
of 1 μmol/L were selected, for subsequent experiments were
transferred to separate plates and treated with 1 μmol/L of
PF2341066 every 2 wk thereafter. The drug-resistant cells
were designated PR (PF2341066 resistant).
Protein detection. Immunodetection of proteins after
SDS-PAGE was performed using standard protocols. Equal
lane loading was assessed using β-tubulin (Sigma) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Chemicon) antibodies. The AKT, ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204),
MET, phospho-MET (Y1234/35), signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phospho-STAT3 (S727)
antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. The phospho-

1626

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

AKT (S473) antibody was from BioSource International. The
phospho-EGFR antibody was from Abcam. The poly(ADPribose) polymerase and total EGFR antibodies were from BD
Biosciences. All antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution,
except for the β-tubulin and GAPDH antibodies, which were
used at 1:10,000 dilution.
Kinase inhibitors. PHA665752 was synthesized at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and PF2341066 was
synthesized by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. All compounds were
reconstituted in DMSO to a 10 mmol/L concentration and
stored at −80°C. Additional compounds detailed in the supplementary tables were synthesized at DFCI or obtained
through commercial suppliers.
Giemsa staining of drug-resistant colonies. Plates of cultured cells were washed in PBS before adding ice-cold methanol as a fixative. After fixation cells were incubated in
Giemsa stain (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h before washing in distilled water and air drying. Colonies containing >50 cells were
counted under microscopy.
Human growth factor antibody array. Cells were seeded
at equivalent density in six-well plates, and the following day
the medium was replaced with 1 mL serum-free medium.
Twenty-four hours later conditioned medium was incubated
with the antibody array as per the manufacturer's instructions (RayBiotech, Inc.). Detection of signal was
achieved using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated streptavidin and exposure of the array membrane to X-ray film.

Results
Establishment of MET-amplified NSCLC cells with
acquired resistance to a selective MET kinase inhibitor.
The NSCLC cell line EBC-1 was previously shown to harbor
focal MET gene amplification and is exquisitely sensitive to
inhibition of MET kinase activity (Fig. 1A; ref. 10). To explore
potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to METtargeted therapeutics, we used the selective small molecule
MET TKI PF2341066, which is currently being evaluated in
clinical trials.4 PF2341066-resistant clones were generated
from EBC-1 cells by exposing cells to increasing concentrations of PF2341066 for 3 months. The resultant clones (designated EBC-1 PR1 to EBC-1 PR22), following expansion from
single cells, showed resistance to PF2341066 treatment, with
the majority of clones exhibiting at least 50-fold reduced
drug sensitivity and several clones showing >250-fold reduced drug sensitivity (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1).
The drug-resistant clones also exhibited cross-resistance
to an additional selective MET TKI, PHA665752 (Fig. 1A;
Supplementary Table S1).
To explore the biochemical basis for acquired MET TKI
resistance in the EBC-1–derived clones, the phosphorylation state of MET and the downstream effectors AKT
and ERK1/2 was examined. As expected, in the parental
EBC-1 cells, acute treatment with PF2341066 causes virtually complete suppression of MET autophosphorylation, as
well as phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, in each of nine independent EBC-1–derived drugresistant clones, PF2341066 treatment caused suppression

EGFR-MET Cross-Talk in MET TKI Resistance in NSCLC

Figure 1. Generation of PF2341066-resistant NSCLC cells. A, PF2341066-resistant clones derived by exposing the EBC-1 NSCLC cell line to increasing
concentrations of the MET TKI PF2341066 weekly for 3 mo exhibit increased resistance to PF2341066 as well as an additional MET TKI, PHA665752.
The 15 drug-resistant clones are designated as “PR” (PF2341066 resistant). Cell viability was assayed 72 h after treatment with the indicated drug
concentrations. Independent triplicate tests were performed, and the results reflect the mean and SD. B, PF2341066-resistant cells maintain AKT and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of PF2341066. EBC-1 and EBC-1 PR cells were treated for 6 h with 200 nmol/L PF2341066. Cell extracts were
immunoblotted to detect the indicated proteins. Total proteins are shown to serve as loading controls. The parental cell line EBC-1 is indicated by an asterisk (*).

of MET phosphorylation, indicating that the observed drug
resistance does not reflect drug efflux or a mutation that
prevents drug binding to MET. However, in contrast to the
findings with parental EBC-1 cells, complete inhibition of
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in the drug-resistant
clones was not observed after PF2341066 treatment
(Fig. 1B), suggesting an uncoupling of these critical cell
survival effectors from MET kinase function in the drugresistant clones.
Acquired resistance to MET kinase inhibition is associated with a switch to EGFR dependency. To identify cell
survival pathways specifically engaged in the EBC-1–derived
PF2341066-resistant cells, clones PR5 and PR22 (>250-fold increased resistance to PF2341066) were tested for sensitivity
to 35 established and investigational anticancer agents (Supplementary Table S2) in a 72-hour cell viability assay (Fig. 2A,
B). Among the tested agents, EBC-1 PR5 cells displayed substantial sensitivity to two different EGFR TKIs, erlotinib and
HKI-272 (Fig. 2A), as single agents, whereas EBC-1 PR22 cells
displayed sensitivity to both of these compounds only when
applied in combination with PF2341066 (Fig. 2B). These re-

sults suggest that EBC-1 PR5 cells have completely switched
their survival dependency from MET to EGFR kinase-mediated
signaling, whereas the EBC-1 PR22 cells seem to have become codependent on both MET and EGFR signaling to
maintain cell survival. Significantly, the erlotinib had no effect on ERK1/2 or AKT signaling pathways in the EBC-1 parental cell line (Fig. 2C). In contrast, erlotinib treatment of
the EBC-1 PR5 clone completely abolished ERK1/2 signaling (Fig. 2D, lanes 3–6). Suppression of downstream signaling
was similarly seen in EBC-1 PR22, but only when erlotinib
and PF2341066 were tested in combination (Fig. 2D, lanes 10
and 12).
To determine whether a switch to either partial or complete EGFR dependency occurs in the context of acquired
resistance to PF2341066 in the other drug-resistant clones,
each clone was treated with erlotinib alone or in combination with PF2341066 and cell viability was measured. Thirteen
(87%) of the 15 tested EBC-1 PR clones showed acquisition of
sensitivity either to single-agent erlotinib or to the combination of erlotinib and PF2341066 (Supplementary Fig. S1A, B),
suggesting that in these MET-amplified cells EGFR-mediated

resistance. A, the NSCLC cell line EBC-1 was treated for 72 h with a
range of concentrations of PF2341066 (MET inhibitor; PF), erlotinib
(EGFR inhibitor), or a combination of both agents, after which cell
viability was determined. B, 1 μmol/L erlotinib was added to a range of
concentrations of PF2341066 for 6 h of treatment of EBC-1 cells.
Cell extracts were immunoblotted to detect the indicated proteins.

signaling is a potent and “preferred” mechanism for maintaining cell survival when the population is chronically exposed
to a MET TKI. Notably, there was no evidence of increased
EGFR expression in any of the drug-resistant clones compared
with parental EBC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Combined MET and EGFR blockade prevents the emergence of drug resistant clones. The observed switch to EGFR
dependency or the acquisition of codependency on MET and
EGFR signaling in the context of MET TKI resistance prompted
us to examine the potential benefit of combining these inhibitors to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant NSCLC cells.
First, we established that the combination of erlotinib and
PF2341066 does not detectably decrease the IC50 value relative
to PF2341066 treatment alone in the setting of EBC-1 cells, as
measured by growth inhibition (Fig. 3A). Moreover, combined
MET and EGFR kinase blockade did not yield any enhanced effect on suppression of AKT and ERK1/2 activation in these cells
(Fig. 3B). We then generated PF2341066-resistant clones as described above by exposing the cells to increasing PF2341066

concentrations (“multistep”) or by exposing cells weekly to a
1 μmol/L concentration (“single-step”), either in the presence
or absence of 1 μmol/L erlotinib. Erlotinib alone had no effect
on cell viability, but the addition of erlotinib to PF2341066
almost completely inhibited the development of PF2341066resistant clones (Fig. 3C).
To further explore the role of EGFR activation in the development of resistance to a MET kinase inhibitor, EBC-1 cells were
exposed over 4 weeks to PF2341066 in the presence of the EGFR
ligand, EGF. In the acute treatment setting, combined exposure
to supplementary EGF and PF2341066 had almost no effect on
short-term viability of EBC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A);
however, addition of EGF to PF2341066-treated cells led to a
persistent low level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation despite the
complete suppression of MET autophosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Furthermore, the combination of supplementary EGF and PF2341066 yielded a significant increase in
the number of PF2341066-resistant clones generated after
chronic drug exposure (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These findings

further support a role for EGFR signaling in the emergence of
MET TKI resistance in MET-dependent NSCLC cells and suggest that ligand-mediated EGFR activation could constitute a
potential mechanism.
To further explore a potential role for ligand-dependent
activation of EGFR in this setting, a membrane-based antibody array was used to compare the expression of 41 growth
factors in conditioned medium prepared from the parental
EBC-1 cell line and the PF2341066-resistant clone PR22 (Supplementary Fig. S3). This array included three well-established
EGFR ligands—EGF, amphiregulin, and transforming growth
factor α. This analysis revealed significantly increased expression of amphiregulin in the PR22 cell line compared with
EBC-1, suggesting that dysregulated amphiregulin expression
may contribute to the acquisition of EGFR dependency in the
context of resistance to MET TKI treatment.
Cooperation between the EGFR and MET signaling pathways has also been shown to underlie the acquisition of resistance to EGFR TKI treatment in the setting of the EGFR
TKI-sensitive EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line HCC827, as well
as in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients (16). Increased MET signaling, associated with MET gene amplification, was found to
yield acquired resistance to an EGFR TKI by driving ERBB3dependent activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)
signaling. Therefore, to determine whether we could prevent
the emergence of resistance to EGFR TKI treatment in the
setting of MET-amplified NSCLC, using a similar combination strategy to that used with the EBC-1 cell line, we exposed HCC827 cells to either single-step (1 μmol/L) or
multistep (5 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L) erlotinib treatment over
8 weeks and in the absence and presence of PF2341066
(1 μmol/L). HCC827 cells are resistant to PF2341066 treatment, and no additive effect was observed when it was included in combination with erlotinib (Supplementary

1630

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

Fig. S4A). Furthermore, there was no detectable effect on
prosurvival signaling in HCC827 cells with this combination
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). However, the addition of
PF2341066 to erlotinib almost completely inhibited the establishment of erlotinib-resistant HCC827 clones (Fig. 4A).
Conversely, MET activation with its ligand hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) in erlotinib-treated HCC827 cells (either
single-step or multistep) led to an increased number of EGFR
TKI-resistant clones after 8 weeks of treatment (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, addition of HGF to HCC827 cells previously treated with erlotinib dramatically reversed the inhibition of
AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation seen after treatment with
erlotinib alone (Fig. 4C). It was recently reported that HGF
induces resistance in HCC827 cells to the EGFR TKI gefitinib,
and elevated HGF levels were detected in clinical lung adenocarcinoma cases showing intrinsic or acquired resistance
to that agent (19). Together, these findings point to an intimate relationship between EGFR and MET signaling in RTKaddicted NSCLC cells and suggest that maintaining signaling
through AKT or ERK1/2 via cross-talk between these receptors may be a common mechanism by which RTK-addicted
cells are able to survive treatment with small molecule inhibitors of these oncogenic kinases.
To determine whether the EGFR-mediated resistance
mechanisms we observed in the MET-amplified EBC-1 cell
line are more broadly relevant in NSCLC cells, PF2341066resistant clones were generated using another NSCLC cell line
harboring MET amplification, NCI-H1993, which is similarly
dependent on MET signaling for survival (Fig. 5A; ref. 8). As
with EBC-1 cells, treatment of the TKI-resistant clones with
PF2341066 for 6 hours completely suppressed MET autophosphorylation in NCI-H1993 PR cells; however, relative to effects
observed in the parental NCI-H1993 cell line, there was either
partial or complete persistence of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in

the TKI-resistant cells (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, as in the EBC-1
model, whereas the addition of the EGFR TKI erlotinib to
PF2341066 did not significantly affect cell viability in the parental cell line, the combination treatment dramatically reduced the number of PF2341066-resistant clones detected
after 8 weeks (Fig. 5C, D). This finding suggests that EGFR-mediated signaling may be a broadly relevant mechanism of acquired MET TKI resistance in the setting of MET-amplified
NSCLC.
De novo resistance to MET TKI treatment in a NSCLC
cell line harboring MET gene amplification. Acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment in the setting of EGFR mutant
NSCLC has been associated with two distinct genetic mechanisms-acquisition of a secondary T790M mutation within
the EGFR kinase domain and focal amplification of the MET
gene (16, 20). Significantly, both of these genomic alterations
have also been observed in some cases of NSCLC showing
de novo resistance to treatment, suggesting that they may
contribute to oncogenicity as well as drug resistance (2, 21).
De novo drug resistance mechanisms in cancer cell line models
have been shown in some cases to be predictive of acquired
drug resistance in clinical populations (20).

We previously analyzed genomic single-nucleotide polymorphism array data for a large panel of cancer cell lines,
many of which had been tested for PF2341066 sensitivity,
and this data set revealed a NSCLC cell line with elevated
MET copy number but which was resistant to MET TKI
treatment (10). This cell line (NCI-H1573) shows MET gene
amplification and substantial MET phosphorylation. However, unlike with the EBC-1 cell line, PF2341066 treatment
had no significant effect on cell viability and did not result
in complete inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling, despite completely suppressing MET autophosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. S5A, B). These findings resemble those
seen with the PF2341066-resistant EBC-1 clones, and intriguingly, a comparison of gene copy number changes
across 360 “cancer genes” revealed that NCI-H1573 cells
harbor both MET and EGFR amplification (Supplementary
Table S3). However, unlike what was observed in a subset
of the MET TKI-resistant EBC-1 clones, there was no detectable effect on cell viability when NCI-H1573 cells were
treated with erlotinib, either alone or in combination with
PF2341066 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In addition, neither
erlotinib alone nor in combination with PF2341066 yielded

10 nmol/L, ending at 1 μmol/L) or a fixed concentration (1 μmol/L) of PF2341066. In addition, erlotinib (1 μmol/L) was added weekly to similarly
treated plates. All plates were fixed and Giemsa-stained at the end of the experiment, and representative plates are shown.

but showed notable sensitivity to the combination treatment
(Supplementary Table S5). To explore mechanisms underlying sensitivity to the combination treatment, we focused on
one of these lines, COR-L 105. By examining the signaling
consequence of single or combination TKI treatment of these
cells, we determined that inhibition of either EGFR or MET
kinase activity results in only partial inhibition of prosurvival
signaling pathways (Fig. 6). However the combined inhibition
of EGFR and MET signaling led to virtually complete suppression of these pathways. Thus, phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 is clearly coupled to EGFR signaling, whereas the
phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 is coupled to MET signaling (Fig. 6). However, unlike in the HCC827 line, resistance
to MET TKI is not coupled to ERBB3-dependent activation of
PI3K signaling (data not shown). Interestingly, erlotinibinduced inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation leads to an
acute decrease in phospho-MET levels (at 0.5 hour posttreatment) followed by an increase in activated MET at 2 hours of
treatment (Fig. 6). Similarly, PF2341066-mediated inhibition
of MET phosphorylation initially caused a decrease in phosphoEGFR levels at 0.5 hours followed by an increase at 2 hours
posttreatment. These findings highlight the complexity of
cross-talk between MET and EGFR RTKs in NSCLC, potentially involving feedback regulation after TKI treatment.

complete suppression of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
NCI-H1573 cells were then exposed to an additional
30 compounds known to target critical oncogenic signaling
pathways (Supplementary Table S4), either as single agents
or in combination with either PF2341066 or PF2341066/erlotinib,
to determine whether inhibition of MET and EGFR signaling
combined with disruption of a third pathway could inhibit the
growth of these cells. However, there was no additional inhibitory effect seen with any of these 30 compounds with the addition of either PF2341066 or the PF2341066/erlotinib combination
(Supplementary Fig. S5C). These findings implicate additional
as yet unidentified mechanisms of resistance to MET TKIs in
some NSCLC cells treated with these targeted therapeutics.
Potential benefit of combining EGFR and MET TKIs in
NSCLCs with resistance to single agents. To further explore
the potential utility of combining MET and EGFR TKIs in the
treatment of NSCLC, we tested a panel of 100 NSCLC-derived
cell lines for sensitivity to erlotinib, PF2341066, or a combination of the two inhibitors. Whereas the observed sensitivity
to single-agent treatments in the various cell lines tested was
well correlated with genomic activation of the target kinase,
as expected, a few cell lines lacking EGFR or MET genomic
activation were largely refractory to single-agent treatment

Acquired resistance to TKIs in cancer therapy remains a
critical limitation to the efficacy of these agents. Despite
the clinical success of several of these drugs, the eventual
and often rapid development of drug resistance demands a
more thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms
to develop effective strategies to manage or prevent drug resistance. Cancer cell lines can provide a powerful model system to identify clinically relevant mechanisms underlying
acquired drug resistance (13). Here, we have undertaken this
strategy to anticipate potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to MET TKIs, which are currently undergoing clinical testing. Amplified MET is observed in ∼4% of NSCLCs
and 15% of gastric cancers (6, 22), and based on preclinical
findings, it seems to potentially constitute a drug-sensitizing
allele in the setting of MET TKI therapy (8–10). Consequently, several small molecule inhibitors of MET kinase
have been developed and are currently being evaluated in
clinical trials (23).
To anticipate mechanisms of acquired resistance to MET TKI
therapy in the setting of MET-amplified NSCLC, we modeled
acquired resistance to a selective MET TKI in MET-amplified
TKI-sensitive NSCLC-derived cell lines. Through this analysis,
we determined that the engagement of EGFR signaling seems
to be a common mechanism by which these cells develop drug
resistance. In the majority of tested drug-resistant clones, we
observed either a complete switch from MET to EGFR dependency or the acquisition of codependency on these two kinases
for sustained cell survival. Analysis of downstream signaling
pathways in these cells suggests that the coupling of RTK signals to effectors, including AKT and ERK1/2, is a key determinant of sensitivity to these RTK inhibitors—apparently

EGFR-MET Cross-Talk in MET TKI Resistance in NSCLC

reflecting an “addiction” to these signaling pathways. These
observations further reinforce previous findings highlighting
an intimate relationship between EGFR and MET, particularly
in the setting of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment in
NSCLC, where MET amplification constitutes an important
mechanism (16). Considered together with those findings,
our studies implicate a balance of partially redundant EGFRand MET-transduced signals in the survival of a subset of
NSCLCs and highlight the potential importance of combining
MET and EGFR TKIs as a front-line therapy in this setting to
prevent or delay the development of drug resistance. Our findings indicating that this combination treatment, in EGFR mutant or MET-amplified NSCLC-derived cell lines, potently
suppresses the emergence of clones showing TKI resistance
supports the potential clinical utility of this therapeutic
strategy.
The mechanism by which EGFR signaling becomes engaged
during the acquisition of MET TKI resistance in the cell line
model we have examined seems to involve elevated expression
of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin. By analogy, supplementary
HGF, the ligand for MET, can confer resistance to EGFR TKI
treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLCs, a finding similarly shown
in a recent report, and increased HGF levels in tumors were
associated with acquired EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC patients (19). Moreover, another recent report showed that supplementary EGF can promote resistance to MET TKI treatment
in MET-amplified gastric cancers (24), suggesting that the acquisition of resistance to MET TKIs may similarly involve a
switch to EGFR signaling dependency in both MET-amplified
NSCLCs and gastric cancers. Together, these findings highlight
the potentially broader role for changes in the levels of RTK
ligands in the context of acquired drug resistance.
Recent studies showed that the activated MET RTK
can transactivate EGFR and/or the EGFR-related receptor
ERBB3 via receptor cross-talk in MET-amplified NSCLC cells
(8, 16, 25). Together with other studies showing cross-talk between these RTKs both in the context of normal biology and
cancer (26), such findings point to an intimate relationship
between the MET and EGFR pathways. Our observation that
cells with acquired resistance to MET TKIs can exhibit either
a switch from MET to EGFR dependency or the acquisition
of EGFR/MET codependency points to an additional level of

complexity in this relationship, and the mechanistic distinction between these signaling states in the various TKIresistant clones we have generated remains unclear.
Our results suggest that prior knowledge of a predominant
drug resistance mechanism can potentially be exploited to
develop a combination treatment strategy that dramatically
reduces the frequency with which drug resistance develops.
Prompted by the discovery of MET gene amplification as a
mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in EGFR
mutant NSCLC, oncologists are already examining the potential clinical benefit of combining EGFR and MET TKIs to
treat such patients. Our findings suggest that a similar combination strategy could benefit NSCLC patients showing MET
amplification at initial diagnosis. However, we did find one
NSCLC line showing MET gene amplification associated with
high levels of phosphorylated MET but exhibiting resistance
to MET TKI treatment as well as combined MET and EGFR
TKI treatment. Therefore, MET-amplified NSCLCs may not
be expected to uniformly respond to such treatments. Our
observation that a subset of NSCLC-derived cell lines exhibits
MET/EGFR codependency in the absence of any apparent
genomic activation of these RTKs also highlights the potential significance of the EGFR-MET relationship in the context
of first-line therapy strategies with EGFR and MET TKIs.
