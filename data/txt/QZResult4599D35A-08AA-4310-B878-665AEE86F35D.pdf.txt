BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is essential for tumor development, yet mTOR inhibitors have
yielded modest results. This phase 1 study investigated the mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor CC-223 in patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors or multiple myeloma received an initial dose of 7.5-60 mg of CC-223, followed by
oral daily dosing in 28-day cycles until disease progression. The primary objective was to determine the safety, tolerability, nontolerated dosage, maximum tolerated dosage (MTD), and preliminary pharmacokinetic profile. Secondary objectives were to evaluate
pharmacodynamic effects and to describe preliminary efficacy. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and received $1 dose
of CC-223. The most common treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were hyperglycemia, fatigue, and rash. Four patients had
dose-limiting toxicities, including hyperglycemia, rash, fatigue, and mucositis. Therefore, 45 mg/d was determined to be the MTD. The
pharmacokinetics of CC-223 demonstrated a mean terminal half-life ranging from 4.86 to 5.64 hours and maximum observed plasma
concentration ranging from 269 to 480 ng/mL in patients who received CC-223 $45 mg/d. Phosphorylation of mTORC1/mTORC2
pathway biomarkers in blood cells was inhibited by CC-223 $30 mg/d with an exposure-response relationship. Best responses
included 1 partial response (breast cancer; response duration 220 days; 30-mg/d cohort), stable disease (8 patients across $15 mg/d
cohorts; response duration range, 36-168 days), and progressive disease (12 patients). The disease control rate was 32%.
CONCLUSIONS: CC-223 was tolerable, with manageable toxicities. Preliminary antitumor activity, including tumor regression, and eviC 2015 The Authors. Cancer published by

INTRODUCTION
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is
essential for tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metabolic activity in many cancers.1,2
Inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, such as rapamycin and its analogs (ie, rapalogs), have been extensively studied as
anticancer treatments, and several (temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus) have been approved or are in phase 3 trials for different cancer types.3-5 However, these have yielded modest single-agent clinical activity.4-6 Rapalogs predominantly inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), and the efficacy of rapalogs may be partially restricted by failure to prevent
AKT activation through mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), a functionally distinct mTOR complex, or by limited inhibition
of mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1 (4EBP1).6,7
The 4EBPs are critical mediators of mTORC1 effects on cell proliferation,8 and rapalogs do not inhibit

mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4EBP1.7 Inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 leads to more
effective inhibition of cancer cell proliferation than blocking mTORC1 alone.6,8 Inhibitors of mTOR kinase that
function through both the 4EBP1 and p70 S6 kinase 1
arms of mTORC1 and the mTORC2 kinase pathway are
in clinical development.9,10
CC-223 is an adenosine-50 -triphosphate–competitive
inhibitor of the mTOR kinase that targets mTORC1 (both
4EBP1 and p70 S6 kinase 1) and mTORC2, preventing
upregulation of AKT phosphorylation, differentiating it
from the rapalogs.11,12 In preclinical studies, CC-223 was a
potent (half-maximal inhibitory concentration 5 16 nM)
mTOR kinase inhibitor with >150-fold sensitivity over
the related lipid kinase, PI3Ka.12,13 CC-223 is active
against many non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines13 and
solid tumor lines, including breast, glioma, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), and non–small cell lung cancer. CC223 has demonstrated single-agent activity in several
human tumor xenograft models, including U87 glioblastoma multiforme and PC3 prostate cancer.12,13
The primary objective of this phase 1 study was to
determine the safety, tolerability, nontolerated dosage
(NTD), and maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) of orally
administered CC-223 and the preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) of CC-223 in patients with advanced solid
tumors (AST) or multiple myeloma (MM). Secondary
objectives were to evaluate inhibition of tissue biomarkers
S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), 4EBP1, and AKT following
treatment and to describe preliminary efficacy of CC-223.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients 18 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed MM or AST who had progressed on
standard therapy or were unable to tolerate standard anticancer therapy were eligible. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 was required for
patients with solid tumors or 2 for patients with hematologic malignancies. Eligible patients had adequate bone
marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system metastases, acute or
chronic pancreatitis, impaired cardiac function, diabetes
requiring treatment, grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, or
grade 2 diarrhea were excluded.
Study Design

This phase 1/2 study was divided into 2 parts: dose escalation to MTD (Part A) and dose expansion into parallel
cohorts of selected tumor types (Part B). We herein
3482

describe the results of Part A (Part B is ongoing). In Part
A, patients received escalating doses of CC-223 in a modified accelerated titration design.14
This study was conducted in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, the relevant
International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local Institutional Review
Boards, Independent Ethics Committees, or Research
Ethics Boards. All study participants provided written
informed consent before enrolling.
Treatment

On day 21, patients received an initial dose of CC-223,
starting at 7.5 mg, followed by 48-hour observation and
PK sample collection. Oral daily dosing began on day 1
and was maintained in 28-day cycles until clinically significant disease progression, intolerable toxicities, or consent withdrawal. Patients fasted 6 hours before each
CC-223 dose. Initial cohorts of 1 patient each received
CC-223 at dose increments of 100% until the first
instance of CC-223-related, grade 2 toxicity, at which
point the accelerated dose escalation phase was terminated and the cohort expanded to 6 patients. Thereafter,
CC–223 was increased in ;50% increments in cohorts
of 6 patients. If 2 patients experienced dose–limiting
toxicity (DLT), the dose was considered nontolerated
and dose escalation was stopped. The MTD was defined
as the last dose tested below the NTD with 0 or 1 of 6
evaluable patients experiencing DLT during cycle 1.
Adverse events (AEs) and DLTs were assessed using the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4).15
The Safety Review Committee allowed additional
patients to be enrolled in selected dosing cohorts to gather
further PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety data.
Patients in lower-dose cohorts were allowed to receive
higher doses once tolerability of that dose was established.
A protocol amendment revised the criteria for DLTs to
allow management of selected, expected AEs (eg, hyperglycemia, rash) with optimal supportive care. Patients requiring dose reductions because of DLTs or dose delays because
of AEs were permitted to continue treatment as tolerated.
Assessments

Tumor assessments were based on computed tomography
or magnetic resonance imaging. Tumor responses were
based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
(RECIST) version 1.1,16 international uniform response
criteria for MM,17 and revised response assessment criteria for high-grade gliomas.18 All patients who met

NJ) for 10 minutes at 378C. The plates were centrifuged
and aspirated, and 1 mL of ice-cold 100% methanol was
added to the wells. Following overnight incubation at
2808C, plates were centrifuged, aspirated, and washed
twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Samples were stained with cell surface
markers (CD3, CD14, and CD20) and intracellular
markers (pAKT, pS6RP, and p4EBP1), then washed twice
and fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde; data were acquired
on a flow cytometer. The raw measurements were expressed
as median fluorescence intensity values, which were normalized against calibration beads using a linear regression
transformation performed on a log-log scale, and then
reported as equivalent reference fluorophores.

considered evaluable for efficacy.

Optional pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies
were collected from 2 patients (30-mg/d cohort) for
immune-histochemical analyses of pS6RP, p4EBP1,
pPRAS40, pAKT, Ki-67, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), as described
previously.19 Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned, and immunohistochemistry was performed for
each antibody.

Pharmacokinetic Evaluation

Blood samples for PK were collected predose on day 21
and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 24, and 48 hours postdose, as
well as predose on day 15 and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 5, and 8
hours postdose. Urine for PK analyses on day 21 through
day 0 was taken <30 minutes before dosing and 0-4, 4-8,
and 8-24 hours postdose. Plasma and urine CC-223 were
measured using validated chiral liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry methods. Blood samples for biomarker
analyses were collected at screening within 24 hours of
day 21; within 15 minutes predose on days 21, 1, 8, 15,
and 22 of cycle 1; and predose on day 1 in cycle 2. Blood
samples were drawn on day 21 at 1.5, 3, and 5 hours
postdose; on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at 1.5 hours postdose
in cycle 1; and on day 1 at 1.5 hours postdose in cycle 2.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM, version 7.2;
ICON, Dublin, Ireland).
Blood Biomarker Analysis

Blood samples (2 mL) were collected in sodium-heparin
tubes from patients in all cohorts. The blood was loaded
into a 96 deep-well plate, incubated for 1 hour at 378C,
then stimulated with anti–immunoglobulin D and lipopolysaccharide for 15 minutes. The samples were treated

Sequence Analysis

Pretreatment tumor samples for DNA extraction were
obtained from 4 patients and analyzed using nextgeneration sequencing (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge,
MA). DNA was extracted from 40 lg of formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded pre-treatment tumor samples. DNA
sequencing was performed for 3230 exons from 182
cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes often
rearranged in cancer on indexed, adaptor-ligated, hybridization-captured libraries (Agilent SureSelect custom kit).
For all specimens, 25% of the nuclear area was malignant
tumor cells; therefore, no micro/macro-dissection tissue
enrichment was performed. Sequencing on the HiSeq2000
instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was to an average
median depth of >5003, with >99% of bases covering
>1003. Sequence data from genomic DNA and complementary DNA were mapped to the reference human genome (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner1
program and processed using publicly available SAMtools2, Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net), and GATK3
(Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Genomic base substitutions and indels were detected using custom tools optimized for mutation calling in heterogeneous tumor
samples, based on statistical modeling of sequence quality

scores and local sequence assembly. Variations were filtered
using dbSNP and custom artifact database, then annotated
for known and likely somatic mutations using Catalogue of
Somatic Mutations in Cancer (Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute, Genome Research, London, UK). Copy number
alterations were detected by comparing targeted genomic
DNA sequence coverage with a process-matched normal
control sample. Genomic rearrangements were detected by
clustering chimeric reads mapping to targeted introns.

Safety

Four patients experienced DLTs during treatment cycle 1,
including grade 3 hyperglycemia (30 mg/d), grade 3 rash
lasting 5 days (45 mg/d), grade 3 fatigue lasting 10 days
(60 mg/d), and grade 3 mucositis lasting 6 days (60 mg/
d). Thus, 45 mg/d was determined to be the MTD;
60 mg/d was the NTD.
The most common treatment-related AEs were fatigue (64%), nausea (50%), diarrhea (46%), hyperglycemia (43%), mucositis (39%), vomiting (32%), decreased
appetite (32%), asthenia (25%), and rash (25%) (Table

was hyperglycemia (18%), which was reported in the 30mg/d (n 5 2), 45-mg/d (n 5 1), and 60-mg/d cohorts
(n 5 2). Hyperglycemia was monitored by daily fingerstick glucose testing and managed effectively with metformin and/or insulin. One case of treatment-related grade 3
pneumonitis was reported. Most enrolled patients
(n 5 17; 61%) discontinued treatment because of disease
progression, with similar percentages in the 30-mg/d
(56%), 45–mg/d (56%), and 60-mg/d (57%) cohorts.
Five patients died within 28 days of last treatment.
Each death was attributed to disease progression unrelated
to treatment.

Efficacy

Twenty patients were evaluable for efficacy. No patient
had a complete response. One breast cancer patient
(3.6%) in the 30-mg/d cohort had a partial response (PR)
(Fig. 1A). In addition, 5 patients had reduction in target
lesions (Fig. 1B). The best overall response rate per investigator (safety population) was 3.6% (90% confidence
interval, 0.2%-15.9%), and 8 patients (29%) had stable
disease (SD); therefore, the disease control rate was 32.1%
(90% confidence interval, 17.9%-49.4%), and there was
no clear dose dependence. Six patients had disease control
durations of >100 days (range, 110-220 days), including
2 of 3e patients with breast cancer (1 PR and 1 SD) with

The patient with PR had estrogen receptor–positive/
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative breast
cancer with >50% regression in target lesions; her response
lasted 220 days (Supporting Fig. 1). She had received
7 prior anticancer regimens, including chemotherapy, antibody therapy, protein kinase inhibitors, and hormonal
therapy, but no prior everolimus. Her best prior response
was SD lasting 8 months following PI3K inhibitor therapy.
She was treated with CC-223 for 11 cycles (30 mg/d for 5
cycles followed by 45 mg/d for 6 cycles without dose interruptions or reductions) until progression.

daily doses (Fig. 2). The mean terminal half-life of CC-223
was 4.86-5.64 hours over the 30- to 60-mg CC-223 daily
dose range. The mean exposure to CC–223 Cmax and area
under the concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 to
infinity increased in a dose-proportional manner over the
30- to 60-mg dose range following single or multiple doses.
The ratio of AUC from 0-24 hours postdose (AUC0-24)
between day 15 and day 1 was 22% (Supporting Table 1),
suggesting a small amount of accumulation after multiple
dosing. A small fraction of CC-223 (<0.2%) was excreted
unchanged in urine, and renal clearance was negligible, suggesting that metabolism may be the primary clearance route.

achieved for pS6RP (>70%), p4EBP1 (>40%), and
pAKT (>48%) at the 30-, 45-, and 60-mg dose levels at
3 hours on treatment (Fig. 3). The highest inhibition
occurred in stimulated B cells and nonstimulated monocytes for pS6RP, T cells for p4EBP1, and stimulated B

similar for the 3 biomarkers. The highest levels of inhibition were found 1.5-3 hours postdose and were sustained
for 5 hours. At 24 hours, following first-dose administration, inhibition returned to near-baseline levels in most
patients, whereas inhibition persisted at 24 hours following multiple-dose administration in some patients. Robust comparative analyses were limited by small cohort
size and interpatient variability.

Pretreatment tumor tissue for gene sequencing was
obtained from 4 patients, including 2 with SD 110 days
who had genetic abnormalities associated with mTORC1/
mTORC2 pathway activation (Phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN) deletion and PIK3CA mutation). Quantitative image analysis of immuno-histochemically stained
pre- and on-treatment (days 15-22) biopsies from 2 patients
(HCC and salivary gland tumor) were evaluated. Significant inhibition of pS6RP, pAKT, and Ki67 staining was
detected (Supporting Fig. 2), and an increase in TUNELpositive cells (data not shown) was seen in both the HCC
and salivary gland tumor samples after treatment with CC223. Additionally, the HCC sample showed inhibition of
p4EBP1 after treatment initiation (data not shown). These
preliminary PD data are consistent with suppression of
both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity in blood and
tumor tissue.
Increases in glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels
were CC-223 dose-dependent in patients receiving doses
30 mg/d (Table 3; Supporting Fig. 3).

Exposure-Response Analysis and PK/PD
Correlation

A direct inhibitory model (maximum observed PK effect)
was used to describe the concentration–effect relationship
between CC-223 concentrations and changes in PD endpoints (pAKT, p4EBP1, and pS6RP in stimulated B cells,
T cells, and monocytes, respectively) relative to baseline.
3488

Under stimulated conditions, the concentration-effect
relationships were best characterized for p4EBP1 measured in stimulated T cells, and for pAKT and pS6RP
measured in stimulated B cells and monocytes (Fig. 4)
because PK/PD modeling resulted in successful minimization of covariance in nonlinear mixed effects modeling.

CC-223 Phase I Study in Advanced Cancers/Bendell et al

Half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values
for pAKT inhibition in stimulated B cells and monocytes
were 50.4 and 85.0 ng/mL, respectively; EC50 values for
pS6RP inhibition in stimulated B cells and monocytes
were 20.3 and 174 ng/mL, respectively. The EC50 value
for p4EBP1 inhibition in stimulated T cells was 113 ng/
mL (Fig. 4). The mean steady-state plasma CC-223 at 30
and 45 mg/d was ;60 and ;87 ng/mL (AUC0-24 divided
by 24 hours), respectively, which was greater than or close
to the EC50 for pAKT, pS6RP, and p4EBP1 inhibition in
stimulated B cells. These results suggest that a single dose
of 30 mg CC-223 may provide overall inhibition of
these biomarkers during a 24-hour dosing interval.
DISCUSSION
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently activated
in human cancers, leading to aberrant metabolism,
increased proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells.1 Although considerable evidence confirms the
importance of this pathway in human cancers, the clinical
activity of rapalog monotherapy is modest, potentially
due to insufficient inhibition of AKT and 4EBP1 phosphorylation.7,8,20,21 In preclinical studies, dual suppression of mTORC1 and mTORC2 can increase antitumor
activity versus agents exclusively targeting mTORC1.13,22
Active-site inhibitors such as CC-223 that target both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 through mTOR kinase activity
inhibit activation of AKT and 4EBP1 and are promising
therapeutic agents.12,13
In this phase 1 study, single-agent CC-223 was
administered to 28 pretreated patients with AST or MM.
The MTD was 45 mg/d, although 11.1% of patients at
the MTD required dose reductions and 55.6% required
interruptions. CC-223 was associated with a safety profile
similar to that of other mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors,
such as MLN0128/INK128 and AZD8055.9,23 Common CC-223–related AEs were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea,
and hyperglycemia; the most common grade 3 AE was
hyperglycemia (18%). Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and other metabolic abnormalities are common in
patients treated with other mTOR inhibitors, including
the rapalogs everolimus and temsirolimus.24-27 In the
present study, dose-dependent glucose and C-peptide
level elevations occurred in patients receiving CC-223
30 mg/d. Interestingly, neither hypercholesterolemia
nor hypertriglyceridemia was a frequent event in patients
treated with CC-223, a finding similar to that observed
with other mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors.9,23
The pharmacokinetics of CC-223 were doseproportional. Pharmacodynamic analyses showed a
Cancer

relationship between CC-223 exposure and pAKT,
p4EBP1, and pS6RP reduction in stimulated B cells, T
cells, and monocytes, respectively, thus differentiating
CC–223 from rapalogs that typically cause pAKT activation and minimal p4EBP1 inhibition.22,28 Substantial
pS6RP (>70%), p4EBP1 (>40%), and pAKT (>50%)
inhibition was observed at 30 mg CC-223, although
pS6RP and pAKT inhibition was more complete than
p4EBP1 inhibition. Additionally, preliminary evidence
of inhibition of pS6RP, p4EBP1, pAKT, and proliferation marker Ki-67 was observed in paired tumor biopsies
in 2 patients.
Our dose-escalation study demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity through durable tumor control
with one PR (3.6%) lasting 220 days in 1 patient with
breast cancer and 8 patients (29%) with SD (>100 days in
5 patients), including 2 patients with tumors exhibiting
molecular abnormalities associated with mTORC1/
mTORC2 pathway activation. In a phase 1 study of
AZD8055 (mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor), the best
response was SD in 7 patients (14.3%).9 In a phase 1 study
of MLN0128, 1 patient (4%) with MM had a response
lasting ;2 months and 15 patients (56%) had SD.10
Given the evidence of mTORC1/mTORC2 pathway inhibition, acceptable safety profile, dose–proportional PK, exposure-related PD effects, and encouraging
antitumor activity, cohorts of patients with MM, diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, and selected solid tumors are currently being evaluated in the expansion phase of this
study. During this expansion phase, flurodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography imaging will be explored
as a potential visual biomarker of PD activity, and tumor
biopsies will be obtained to evaluate molecular parameters
associated with CC-223 treatment.
