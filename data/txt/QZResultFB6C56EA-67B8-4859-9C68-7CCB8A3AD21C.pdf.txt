Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In cancer patients, visual identification of sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) is achieved by the injection
of dyes that bind avidly to endogenous albumin, targeting these compounds to LNs where they are
efficiently filtered by resident phagocytes1,2. Here we translate this “albumin hitchhiking”
approach to molecular vaccines, via the synthesis of amphiphiles (amph-vaccines) comprised of an
antigen or adjuvant cargo linked to a lipophilic albumin-binding tail by a solubility-promoting
polar polymer chain. Structurally-optimized CpG-DNA/peptide amph-vaccines exhibited dramatic
increases in LN accumulation and decreased systemic dissemination relative to their parent
compounds, leading to 30-fold increases in T-cell priming and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy while
greatly reducing systemic toxicity. Amph-vaccines provide a simple, broadly-applicable strategy
to simultaneously increase the potency and safety of subunit vaccines.

A major challenge in the development of subunit vaccines is the efficient delivery of
antigen/adjuvant to secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses are
orchestrated3,4. Attempts to enhance vaccine delivery have included the use of depotforming adjuvants5 or nanoparticulate carriers that are preferentially internalized by antigen
presenting cells (APCs)4, 6–12, but approaches that could employ well-defined molecular
conjugates would be attractive. Antigens conjugated to antibodies targeting dendritic cells
(DCs) reach these cells in the draining LNs but also drain into the systemic circulation and
access DCs in distal tissues13,14, which might promote tolerance unless inflammatory
adjuvants are systemically co-administered. Lymph node targeting is also required for
cancer staging in sentinel LN mapping procedures, where radioactive or colored dyes are
injected at tumor resection sites1. Compounds which bind avidly to serum albumin are
particularly effective LN tracers2; albumin binding targets these molecules to lymphatics
and draining LNs, where they accumulate in APCs15,16. Inspired by this strategy, we set out
to create LN-targeting molecular vaccines designed to similarly “hitchhike” on albumin to
LNs. Exploiting albumin’s role as a fatty acid transporter, we hypothesized that antigens/
adjuvants modified with a lipophilic albumin-binding domain would accumulate in
lymphoid organs following injection via in situ complexation and transport with endogenous
albumin. To develop this strategy, we studied model vaccines composed of peptide antigens
and CpG DNAs, single-stranded oligonucleotides containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine
motifs that bind Toll-like receptor-9 and serve as potent molecular adjuvants17,18.

To identify an optimal albumin-binding domain that could be appended to either CpG or
peptide antigens, we constructed a series of amphiphilic 20-base phosphorothioate (PS)stabilized CpG oligos 5′-linked to lipophilic tails (amph-CpGs, Fig. 1a). We first evaluated
the interaction of fluorescein amidite (FAM)-labeled conjugates with serum proteins by size
exclusion chromatography (SEC, Fig. 1b). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) exhibited a major
protein fraction eluting at 5.3 min in SEC that coincided with albumin (Extended Data Fig.
1a). The vast majority of mono-acyl- (C18-CpG) or cholesterol-conjugated (Cho-CpG)
oligos eluted as monomers at 5.8 min in the presence or absence of serum, indicating a lack
of interaction with albumin (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). In contrast, diacyl lipidconjugated CpGs (lipo-CpGs) in aqueous solution eluted as micelles (3.7 min), but
following incubation with serum, nearly 50% of the lipo-CpG co-migrated with albumin
(Fig. 1b). Biotinylated lipo-CpG (but not CpG) incubated with FBS and then captured with
magnetic beads was found to pull down albumin, and lipo-CpG was efficiently captured by
albumin-conjugated agarose (Extended Data Figs. 1b–c). Biolayer interferometry and
spectroscopy measurements of FRET between lipo-CpG and purified albumin further
confirmed their molecular association in solution (Extended Data Figs. 1d–e).
We next characterized the in vivo trafficking of CpG conjugates. Amph-CpGs were injected
s.c. in C57Bl/6 mice, and 24h later, draining LNs were excised intact for IVIS fluorescence
imaging. C18- and Cho-CpG showed marginally increased uptake in LNs relative to
unmodified CpG, reaching levels similar to CpG delivered by two prototypical vaccine
vehicles known to enhance vaccine accumulation in LNs, incomplete Freund’s adjuvant
(IFA) or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated liposomes6 (Fig. 1c). In contrast, lipo-CpG
accumulated 8-fold more than soluble CpG (Fig. 1c). Over 7 days post-injection, soluble

CpG exhibited no LN accumulation above 0.3% of the injected dose at any time, while lipoCpG accumulated for 3 days, giving a 12-fold greater area-under-the-curve (AUC) for total
LN exposure to CpG (Fig. 1d). LN accumulation was not dependent on TLR-9-recognized
CpG motifs, and was not due to increased nuclease resistance of lipid-modified PSbackbone CpGs (data not shown).

Our in vitro analysis indicated that lipo-CpG molecules equilibrated between micellar and
albumin-bound forms in the presence of serum, making it unclear which state was
responsible for LN targeting. However, injection of lipo-CpG pre-incubated for 5 hr with
freshly isolated 90 vol% mouse serum at 37°C, conditions where SEC showed the vast
majority of the amphiphile co-migrated with albumin, led to essentially identical LN
targeting as direct lipo-CpG injections (data not shown). To further address this question, we
introduced poly-guanine repeats between the diacyl lipid and CpG sequence to lock the
amphiphiles in the micellar state and block disassembly by albumin. G-quadruplex hydrogen
bonding between adjacent oligo strands in lipo-Gn-CpG micelles containing 4 or more
guanine repeats rendered the micelles stable in the presence of serum (Extended Data Figs.
2a–d). Labeled albumin did not co-migrate with stabilized micelles as assessed by SEC
(Extended Data Fig. 2e), suggesting that the amphiphiles do not interact with albumin as
intact micelles. Despite forming micelles with similar sizes (Extended Data Fig. 2f), Gquartet-stabilized lipo-G4-CpG or lipo-G6-CpG micelles exhibited poor LN accumulation
following injection compared to albumin-binding lipo-CpG and lipo-G2-CpG (Fig. 1d, e). A
possible explanation is that amplification of nonspecific matrix binding by the PS-DNA
backbones19,20 in the multivalent micellar form irreversibly trapped the stabilized micelles
at the injection site. Histological sections of draining LNs showed little detectable CpG or
lipo-G4-CpG, while albumin-binding lipo-CpG and lipo-G2-CpG accumulated in the
subcapsular sinus and interfollicular areas (Fig. 1f). LN-accumulating amphiphiles were
associated with F4/80+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells, with only a minor
contribution from skin-derived CD207+ DCs (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3). If albumin
“hitchhiking” mediates LN targeting, then covalent conjugation of oligos to albumin should
also enhance LN accumulation. We found that injection of CpG conjugated to mouse serum
albumin (MSA) gave slightly lower oligo uptake in LNs than lipo-CpG, but much greater
accumulation than soluble CpG (Extended Data Fig. 4). Altogether, these data suggest that
efficient LN delivery of CpG oligonucleotides conjugated to lipophilic tails is enhanced by
partitioning from micelles into a serum albumin-bound state.
To identify potential differences in the function of CpG vs. optimally LN-targeted lipo-G2CpG beyond altered biodistribution, we assessed several aspects of CpG bioactivity in vitro:
lipo-G2-CpG was internalized by DCs into endolysosomes in a pattern indistinguishable
from CpG in confocal microscopy, albeit to 2-fold higher levels (Extended Data Figs. 5a–b).
Lipo-G2-CpG did not activate the lipid-binding receptor TLR2 in reporter cells, but both
free CpG and amphiphile-CpG activated RAW macrophages bearing a NF-κB reporter in a
CpG sequence-specific manner (Extended Data Figs. 5c–d). When DCs were activated with
CpG or lipo-G2-CpG and pulsed with OVA protein to test cross-presentation of antigen to
OT-I (OVA-specific) T-cells, DC activation by soluble or amphiphile-CpG led to similar T-

cell proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Thus, lipid modification of CpG increased uptake
in the presence of serum but did not otherwise greatly alter the bioactivity of CpG.

To determine the impact of LN targeting on the immune response, we immunized mice with
ovalbumin protein (OVA) mixed with unmodified CpG, Cho-CpG, CpG emulsified in IFA,
or lipo-Gn-CpGs (n=0, 2, 4, 6). OVA (which has only 13% sequence identity with albumin)
showed minimal association with lipo-CpGs (data not shown) and thus these vaccinations
assessed the impact of lymph node targeting of the adjuvant only, relying on normal
lymphatic drainage of the OVA antigen. Lipo-Gn-CpG-adjuvanted vaccines primed
significantly increased frequencies of antigen-specific, cytokine-producing CD8+ T-cells
compared to unmodified CpG, Cho-CpG, or CpG in IFA, but the strongest responses (up to
32-fold greater than unmodified CpG) were elicited by lipo-CpG and lipo-G2-CpG (Figs.
2a–b; Extended Data Figs. 6a–b). Strikingly, the magnitude of the T-cell response was
strongly correlated with LN accumulation of CpG (Fig. 2c). Lipo-CpG also modestly
increased antibody responses by ~3-fold and enhanced CD8+ T-cell responses to the model
HIV antigen SIV-gag (Extended Data Figs. 6c–d). Importantly, no antibodies against
albumin were detected for any of the amphiphile-CpG vaccines (Extended Data Figs. 6e–f
and data not shown). Control immunizations with non-TLR agonist lipo-GpC or diacyl-PEG
conjugates (lipo-PEG) mixed with OVA were ineffective and amph-CpG responses were
identical in TLR2−/− mice (Extended Data Figs. 6g–h), ruling out a direct adjuvant effect of
the diacyl lipid tail. CpG that is not captured in local LNs drains to the systemic circulation,
leading to systemic inflammatory toxicities21. Despite lymphadenopathy of draining LNs
indicating local activity, repeated injections of lipo-CpGs showed greatly reduced systemic
inflammation relative to free CpG (Figs. 2d–e and Extended Data Figs. 7a–b). While further
work will be needed to determine any potential autoimmune toxicities related to LN
targeting of CpG18, these results suggest that the LN targeting achieved by amph-CpGs
greatly enhances the potency of this molecular adjuvant while simultaneously lowering
acute systemic side effects.

Synthesis of lipo-CpG is straightforward due to the solubility imparted by the long polar
oligonucleotide block, but depending on the amino acid sequence, lipidated polypeptides can
be essentially insoluble22. To generalize this LN targeting strategy to antigens and other
potential vaccine components, we synthesized peptides linked to a diacyl lipid tail via a PEG
block chosen to promote the conjugate solubility (amph-peptides, Fig. 3a). Amph-peptides
and lipo-PEGs in water form micelles, but these amphiphiles can also insert their diacyl tails
into cell membranes. We found that lipo-PEG amphiphiles with short PEG blocks exhibited
preferential plasma membrane insertion when incubated with cells in the presence of
albumin in vitro (Figs. 3b and Extended Data Figs. 8a–b), which might limit transit to LNs
on albumin in vivo. However, increasing the polar block to 48 ethylene glycol units gave
amphiphiles that partitioned preferentially into solution while retaining albumin binding
(Figs. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 8c), consistent with prior studies23. This in vitro
partitioning directly predicted in vivo draining patterns, as lipo-PEG-FAM amphiphiles
injected s.c. showed increasing LN accumulation with increasing PEG block length (Fig.
3c). Although optimal immunostimulatory CpGs are ~20 bases, an analogous trend was
observed for DNA amphiphiles as a function of oligo length (Extended Data Figs. 8d–e).

Like amph-CpGs, the structure of the hydrophobic block was also important; while lipoPEG amphiphiles with long diacyl tails (≥16 carbons, which exhibit a high affinity for
albumin24) showed intense LN accumulation, shorter lipid tails with low affinity for
albumin showed low LN accumulation (Fig. 3d). Based on these findings establishing
design rules for efficient targeting of lipo-PEG amphiphiles to LNs, we conjugated peptide
antigens to DSPE-PEG(2KDa) to generate amph-peptides for vaccination studies (Extended
Data Fig. 9a).

To test the potency of combined antigen and adjuvant targeting to LNs, we prepared amphpeptide (DSPE-PEG-peptide) conjugates of a model HIV antigen (AL11 epitope from
Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) gag25), the tumor-associated self-antigen Trp2 from
melanoma26, and a peptide derived from the human papillomavirus (HPV)-derived cervical
cancer antigen E727. Amph-peptides accumulated efficiently in LNs (Extended Data Figs.
9b–c). C57Bl/6 mice immunized with amph-peptides and amph-CpG (lipo-G2-CpG) showed
dramatically increased expansion of antigen-specific, cytokine-producing CD8+ T-cells and
enhanced cytolytic activity relative to unmodified peptide/CpG immunizations (Figs. 4a–c).
To test whether amph-vaccine delivery enhances the protective efficacy of peptide vaccines,
animals bearing established TC-1 tumors (expressing the E7 oncoprotein from HPV) or
B16F10 melanomas were vaccinated. Amph-vaccines triggered sustained regression of large
TC-1 tumors that were only modestly impacted by soluble vaccines (Fig. 4d) and slowed the
growth of melanoma tumors, where a traditional soluble vaccine had no effect (Fig. 4e). In
addition to enhancing the effectiveness of optimal T-cell epitopes, synthetic “long peptide”
antigens28 also exhibited enhanced immunogenicity when delivered as amph-peptides
(Extended Data Figs. 10a–e). This result is of particular interest since a finite pool of long
sequences permit peptide vaccines to provide effective coverage of epitopes across the
diverse haplotypes of a given target patient population. Amphiphile-long peptides were also
~10-fold more potent than soluble peptides when combined with non-CpG, non-LN-targeted
alternative TLR adjuvants (Extended Data Fig. 10f), showing that CpG is not required to see
an enhanced response to LN-targeted peptides. Altogether, the results presented here define
design rules for amphiphile conjugates as a general strategy to enhance the potency and
safety of LN-active compounds, an approach that may be applicable to a broad range of
immunomodulatory therapeutics and imaging agents. These findings also have implications
for how the immune system may survey lipophilic antigens. Further work will be needed to
determine whether albumin binding is functionally critical, or alternatively whether other
rare serum components may have a role in the observed lymph node targeting.

METHODS SUMMARY
Synthesis of vaccine amphiphiles
CpG/ODN amphiphiles were synthesized using an ABI 394 synthesizer on a 1.0 micromole
scale. All lipophilic phosphoramidites were conjugated as a final ‘base’ on the 5′ end of
oligos19. Antigen amphiphiles were synthesized by reacting N-terminal cysteine-modified
peptides with maleimide-PEG2000-DSPE in DMF.

a, Size exclusion chromatography of fetal bovine serum (FBS), albumin, and fluoresceinlabeled amph-CpGs. FBS and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were monitored using
absorptions at 280 nm, while CpG oligos were monitored at 480 nm (Fluorescein peak). b,
lipo-CpG, but not CpG, interact with serum albumin as shown by SDS-PAGE following
protein pull-down assays: Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was incubated with 3′-biotin-labeled
CpG (CpG-biotin), lipo-CpG (lipo-CpG-biotin), or PBS for 1 hr at 37°C. Streptavidinconjugated magnetic beads were added to capture biotinylated CpGs and any associated
proteins, separated by a magnet, boiled to release bound CpG/proteins, and subjected to
SDS-PAGE analysis. Lane 1: protein MW ladder; lane 2: purified BSA; lane 3: FBS (100×
dilution, 10 μL loading); lane 4: pull-down control, FBS incubated with streptavidinmagnetic beads; lane 5: pull-down with CpG-biotin, FBS was incubated with CpG-biotin
and streptavidin-magetic beads; lane 6: pull-down with lipo-CpG-biotin, FBS incubated with
lipo-CpG-biotin and streptavidin magnetic beads; lane 7: FBS (100× dilution, 5 μL loading).
c, Fluorescein-labeled CpG or lipo-CpG was incubated with albumin-conjugated agarose
resin for 1 hr at 37°C, and the resin was separated by filtration. The filtrate and recovered
agarose were visualized by a gel imager and quantified by fluorescence measurements. d,
Bio-layer interferometry measurements of lipo-CpG and CpG binding to immobilized
bovine serum albumin. Albumin-conjugated BLI probes were immersed in solutions of lipoCpG, and wavelength shifts (Δλ) of the interferometry pattern association and dissociation
curves were followed over time to determine affinity constants of binding at 25°C. Shown
are apparent kon, koff, and KD values from fits to the data. e, Fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) between FAM-labeled lipo-CpG and rhodamine-conjugated albumin
assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy. CpG-F or lipo-CpG-F (1.65 μM) alone or mixed
with BSA-Rh (1.5 μM) in PBS were excited at 488 nm and emission was recorded from
500–650 nm.

Extended Data Figure 2. Construction and characterization of G-quadruplex-stabilized CpG
adjuvants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, G-quadruplex stabilized CpG micelles are self-assembled from amphiphiles composed of
three distinct segments: an immunostimulatory CpG sequence, a central repeat block
containing n=1–10 G-quartet-forming guanines followed by (10–n) non-interacting
thymidines, and a diacyl lipid tail. In aqueous solutions, these amphiphiles self-assembled
into three-dimensional spherical micelles with a CpG corona and a lipid core. In the
presence of K+, neighboring guanine repeats in the oligo corona form G-quadruplex
structures via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and stabilize the micelle structure. The oligo
micelles’ stabilities in the presence of serum were programmed by altering the length of the
guanine repeat. b, Parallel G-quartet formation among DNA strands within the micelles was
detected by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, as manifested by the shifting of positive
peaks from 278 nm toward 262 nm and troughs at 245 nm as the number of guanines in the
structure increased. c, Pyrene excimer fluorescence was used to assay the stabilities of Gquadruplex micelles in the presence of albumin: Pyrene dye incorporated in stabilized CpG
micelles (n > 2) retained excimer fluorescence in the presence of high concentrations of
albumin. In contrast, albumin binds to the lipids moiety of unstabilized micelles (n ≤ 2) and

disrupts the micelle structures, leading to loss of excimer fluorescence in an albumin
concentration-dependent manner as the protein disrupts the micelles into albumin-bound
unimers. Shown below the schematic is the fraction of amphiphile-CpG remaining in the
micellar state as a function of albumin concentration as reported by excimer fluorescence.
Arrow indicates the plasma concentration of albumin. d, Stability profiles of G-quadruplex
CpG micelles as measured by size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Fluorescein-labeled CpG micelles were incubated with 20% FBS in PBS in
the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ and 20 mM K+ at 37°C for 2 hours, then analyzed by SEC.
FBS and BSA were monitored using absorptions at 280 nm, while lipo-Gn-CpG amphiphiles
were monitored at 480 nm (Fluorescein peak). Lipo-Gn-CpG with n=0 or 2 partitioned to comigrate with albumin, while amphiphiles with n>2 showed increasing fractions of the
amphiphiles migrating as intact micelles in the presence of serum with increasing n. e,
Fluorescein-labeled lipo-G6-CpG (5 μM) and Alexa Fluor® 647-labeled BSA (5 μM) were
incubated for 2 hrs at 37 °C in PBS+20 mM KCl, and then analyzed by size exclusion
chromatography. Spectra were monitored at 480 nm (ODN channel, green line, fluorescein)
and 640 nm (protein channel, red line, Alexa Fluor® 647). The majority of BSA and CpG
micellar aggregates eluted separately. f, Amph-CpG micelles sizes as determined by
dynamic light scattering. All data are mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed by
one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests.

agonist) was incubated for 24 hours with the InvivoGen HEK-Blue™ murine TLR2 reporter
cell line, a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter system. SEAP levels
were quantified by incubating supernatant with QuantiBlue™ substrate for 1h and reading
absorption at 620 nm. d, Amph-CpG, CpG, or control amph-GpC (1 μM) were incubated
with InvivoGen RAW-Blue™ mouse macrophage reporter cells, which secrete SEAP upon
TLR, NOD or Dectin-1 stimulation. SEAP levels were quantified by incubating supernatant
with QuantiBlue™ substrate for 1h and reading absorption at 620 nm. e, Bone marrowderived immature dendritic cells were incubated overnight with indicated concentrations of
OVA and maturation stimuli (or medium alone). DCs were washed 3 times with PBS and
30,000 CFSE-labeled OT-I CD8+ T cells were then added to each well. Cells were collected
after 2 days of co-culture, and stained and gated for DAPI- (viable) CD8+ T cells using
Flowjo v.7.6.5 (Treestar). Extent of proliferation was quantified by determining the % of
cells that had undergone division by determining % of viable CD8+ T cells that had diluted
CFSE using T cells alone as a control for the no division/dilution peak. Shown are mean

a, Amphiphiles with varying hydrophilic PEG lengths were prepared by solid phase
synthesis of diacyl tails coupled to 1–8 hexa-ethylene glycol phosphorothioate units.
Fluorescein was incorporated either at the 3′ terminal (for membrane insertion analyses) or
adjacent to the lipid moiety (for albumin-binding analyses). b, Splenocytes from C57Bl/6
mice (5×107cells/mL) were incubated with lipo-(PEG)n-Fluorescein (1.67 μM) and albumin
(100 μM) at 37°C for 1 hour. Shown is a representative image of membrane insertion
observed by confocal microcopy for lipo-(PEG)1-fluorescein. c, Equilibrium partitioning
measurements shown as a function of albumin concentration at 37°C. Lipo-fluorescein(PEG)n (5 μM) was incubated with varying concentrations of BSA and fluorescence
intensities were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. BSA binding disrupted the
micellar structure and decreased the self-quenching of fluorescein. All samples reached
maximum fluorescence intensities at around 10 μM BSA, indicating 100% micelle breakup
at this concentration (at higher BSA concentrations, fluorescence decreases due to solution
turbidity). Arrow indicates plasma concentration of albumin. d, e, Lipo-Tn-FAM
