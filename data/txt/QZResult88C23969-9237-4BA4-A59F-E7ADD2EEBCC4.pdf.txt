ABSTRACT
Tanshinone I (Tanshinone-1), a major active principle of Salvia miltiorrhiza
(Danshen), has been shown to overcome tumor drug resistance and metastasis.
Here we report that tanshinone-1 inhibits angiogenesis. Tanshinone-1 inhibited
proliferation, migration and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells, rat aortic
ring sprouting and the neovascularization of the chick chorioallantoic membrane
in a concentration-dependent manner. In endothelial cells, tanshinone-1 almost
completely inhibited phosphorylation of Stat3 at Tyr705 regardless of hypoxia or
normoxia but only slightly decreased the hypoxia-induced HIF-1α accumulation.
In tumor cells, contrastively, tanshinone-1 could not only make phosphorylation
of Stat3 at Tyr705 disappear but also reduce the hypoxia-induced accumulation of
HIF-1α to its baseline levels at normoxia. Consequently, VEGF secretion from tumor
cells was reduced, which could potentiate the direct inhibition of tanshinone-1 on
endothelial cells. Together with its overcoming tumor drug resistance and metastasis,
our results reveal unique characteristics of tanshinone-1 and its improved derivatives
as promising angiogenesis inhibitors.

[2, 3]. Therefore, finding new antiangiogenesis strategies
becomes urgent for cancer therapy in a safe, efficacious
way and ideally overcoming tumor drug resistance and/
or metastasis.
Many natural products have been reported to inhibit
angiogenesis via various mechanisms though having
scarcely been approved for cancer therapy yet due to
toxicities or other reasons [4–10]. The traditional Chinese
medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) is famous for its
safe, effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases with
a long history. Its several preparations are still widely
used, especially in the treatment of angina pectoris and
congestive heart failure in China [11–14]. Tanshinone I
(Tanshinone-1; Figure 1A), an active principle of Danshen,
shows its clinical safety based on its high content in this
plant [11] and its cardiovascular activity [12]. More
importantly, tanshinone-1 has been shown to kill drugresistant tumor cells. This activity is correlated well

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis inhibition has become an important
strategy for cancer therapy. More than 10 angiogenesis
inhibitors have been used in the clinic. Most of them,
either antibody agents or small-molecule drugs, target
the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) - VEGF
receptor (VEGFR) signaling pathway. However, several
issues have arisen from their applications. They offer
only very limited incremental survival benefits, elicit
severe toxicities especially cardiovascular toxicities and
possibly stimulate treatment resistance and metastasis [1].
These issues drive explorations on targeting other drivers
of angiogenesis, for instance, angiopoietin. Till now,
unfortunately, the efforts have been rewarded with only
limited successes. In Phase III trials in patients with
ovarian cancer, the angiopoietin inhibitor trebananib
increased the median overall survival by only 1 month

with its reducing the active form of signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), phosphorylated
Stat3 at Tyr705 (p-705-Stat3) [11]. Tanshinone-1 was also
found to inhibit tumor metastasis by suppressing the tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced transcriptional activity
of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) [15].
Here we show that tanshinone-1 inhibits
angiogenesis at either hypoxia or normoxia by directly
acting on both endothelial and tumor cells. Tanshinone-1
inhibited proliferation, migration and differentiation
(tube formation) of endothelial cells and thus blocked
angiogenesis at its initiation stage. The antiangiogenic
activity was further reflected in its suppressing rat aortic
ring sprouting and the neovascularization of the chick
chorioallantoic membrane. The effect of tanshinone-1 on
endothelial cells was correlated mainly with its reducing
p-705-Stat3 at both hypoxia and normoxia though it also
slightly lowered the hypoxia-induced accumulation of
hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α). Moreover, this
effect could be further amplified by the reduction of VEGF
secretion from tumor cells subsequent to tanshinone1-mediated decrease in p-705-Stat3 regardless of
ambient oxygen conditions and hypoxia-induced HIF-1α
accumulation. Together with its good safety and excellent
characteristics in overcoming tumor drug resistance and
metastasis, our findings could distinguish tanshinone-1
and its improved derivatives from present antiangiogenesis
agents, especially those used in the clinic.

provide enough cell number of endothelial cells; migration
could allow those cells to move themselves to new
locations; and differentiation (here mimicked by the tube
formation assay) is required for single endothelial cells
to evolve finally into vascular networks. All of them are
important to initiate angiogenesis. Therefore, our results
suggest that tanshinone-1 could inhibit the initiation of
angiogenesis at its different essentials.

RESULTS

Both Stat3 and HIF-1α have been reported to
be involved in angiogenesis [16, 17]. Tanshinone-1
was shown to reduce the levels of p-705-Stat3 at both
normoxic and hypoxic conditions, but not to lower the
levels of either the total Stat3 or phosphorylated Stat3 at
Ser727 (p-727-Stat3) in HMEC-1 cells (Figure 2C). In
contrast, tanshinone-1 could also decrease the levels of
hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein in the same cells in a
concentration-dependent manner, but apparently weakly
when compared with its effect on p-705-Stat3 (Figure 2D).
To detect whether the antiangiogenic activity of
tanshinone-1 is linked to its effect on p-705-Stat3 or HIF-1α
protein, we used specific siRNA against hif-1α (siHIF1α-1 and -2 with different sequences), stat3 (siStat3-1
and -2 with different sequences), or both to silence the
corresponding genes (Figure 3A). Tanshinone-1 was
shown to inhibit the tube formation of HMEC-1 cells
with nearly equal potency at both normoxia and hypoxia
(Figure 3B and 3C; Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B).
Silencing of the hif-1α gene did not obviously impair the
tube formation of HMEC-1 cells at either normoxia or
hypoxia, but slightly potentiated the inhibitory effect of
tanshinone-1 (Figure 3B and 3C; Supplementary Figure
S1A and S1B). In contrast, silencing of the stat3 gene or
both stat3 and hif-1α genes reduced the tube formation at
both normoxia and hypoxia, which was further potentiated

Tanshinone-1 inhibits angiogenesis both
ex vivo and in vivo
Assays for rat aortic ring sprouting and
neovascularization of the chick chorioallantoic membrane
are classical models for ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis,
respectively. Tanshinone-1 was shown to reduce both the
microvessel sprouting of rat aortic rings (Figure 2A) and
the microvessels of the chick chorioallantoic membrane
(Figure 2B, the right panel vs the left one of each image)
in a concentration-dependent manner. The results further
indicate that tanshinone-1 could suppress not only the
initiation of angiogenesis by inhibiting the functions of
endothelial cells but also the final formation of blood
vessels.

Tanshinone-1 reduces p-705-Stat3 and HIF-1α
in endothelial cells, which could contribute to its
tube-formation inhibition

Tanshinone-1 inhibits proliferation, tube
formation and migration of vascular
endothelial cells
Vascular endothelial cells play critical roles
in angiogenesis, especially at its initiation stage.
Tanshinone-1 was shown to inhibit proliferation of
human microvascular endothelial (HMEC-1) cells in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1B). For the 72-h
treatment, tanshinone-1 had an IC50 value of 7.75 μM in
HMEC-1 cells, which is roughly equal to its previously
reported potency in tumor cells [11]. To find the proper
conditions to test its effect on the tube formation and
migration of vascular endothelial cells, we exposed
HMEC-1 cells (2.5 × 104 cells or 2 × 105 cells per well) to
tanshinone-1 for 4 h or 6 h. Tanshinone-1 displayed only
marginal proliferation inhibition on HMEC-1 cells, and
even at 50 μM, the inhibitory rate was just below 20%
(Figure 1C). At the same cell density and exposure time,
however, tanshinone-1 caused suppression of the tube
formation of both HMEC-1 cells (Figure 1D) and human
umbilical vascular endothelial (HUVEC) cells (Figure 1E)
and the migration of HMEC-1 cells (Figure 1F) in a
concentration-dependent manner. Proliferation could

HCC1937, A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 4B and 4C). And
its activity in reducing HIF-1α in tumor cells was more
potent than in endothelial cells (Figure 2D). In contrast,
tanshinone-1 elicited similar effects on Stat3 in both
MCF-7 and HMEC-1 cells by decreasing p-705-Stat3
but not lowering the levels of total Stat3 or p-727-Stat3
at normoxia or hypoxia (Figure 4D). Tanshinone-1 was
further shown to reduce the hypoxia-induced increase in
the levels of VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein secretion in
MCF-7 cells (Figure 4E and 4F).

by the treatment with 50 μM tanshinone-1 (Figure 3B
and 3C; Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B). These
results demonstrate the following facts: (1) Ambient
oxygen concentrations does not affect the inhibitory
effect of tanshinone-1 on the tube formation of HMEC-1
cells, (2) Stat3 rather than HIF-1α stimulates the tube
formation of HMEC-1 cells at both normoxia and hypoxia,
and (3) Downregulation of Stat3 or HIF-1α or both could
not reverse but slightly potentiates the inhibitory effect of
tanshinone-1 on tube formation of endothelial cells.

Tanshinone-1 decreases hypoxia-induced

VEGF, the most potent angiogenesis-stimulating
factor, can be secreted from solid tumor cells in response
to hypoxia stress and/or active angiogenic growth factor
signaling such as the Stat3 signaling. Reduction of VEGF
secretion from tumor cells might attenuate angiogenesis
[18]. When MCF-7 cells were exposed to hypoxia,
the level of HIF-1α first rose, peaked at 6 h – 9 h, and
then declined gradually (Figure 4A). Tanshinone-1 was
revealed to lower the 6-h-hypoxia-induced accumulation
of HIF-1α protein in a concentration-dependent manner

Hypoxia induces the accumulation of HIF-1α
protein mainly by blocking its degradation via the
ubiquitin proteasome pathway [19]. Treatments with
tanshinone-1 did not change the mRNA level of hif-1α
(Figure 5A) but decreased the protein levels of HIF-1α
in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5B). MG-132, a widely used
proteasome inhibitor, could enhance the levels of HIF-1α
protein, especially prominently at normoxia (Figure 5B),
just as previously reported [19]. Pretreatments with

was isolated for vegf mRNA analyses by Real-Time PCR, and cell supernatants were collected and measured for VEGF protein secretion
by ELISA. The level of mRNA or protein at normoxia (20% O2) was normalized as 1. Data from three independent experiments were

MG-132 effectively reversed the tanshinone-1-driven
decrease of HIF-1α protein (Figure 5B). The data indicate
that tanshinone-1 could decrease hypoxia-induced HIF-1α
protein by impairing the proteasome-mediated degradation
rather than by reducing the expression of the hif-1α gene.

HIF-1α protein in tumor cells, we used specific siRNA
against hif-1α (siHIF-1α-1 and -2), stat3 (siStat3-1

found that hypoxia induced the increase in the mRNA

obviously inhibited by tanshinone-1 (Figure 4E and 4F;

downregulation of both HIF-1α and Stat3 completely
prevented the hypoxia-induced VEGF increase. Moreover,
the addition of tanshinone-1 did not further lower the
levels of the VEGF mRNA or the secreted VEGF protein
(Figure 5D and 5E; Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B).
These results indicate that both HIF-1α and Stat3 signaling
contributes to the effect of tanshinone-1 on the mRNA
levels and the protein secretion of VEGF in hypoxic MCF7 cells.

Both Stat3 and HIF-1α have been revealed to drive
tumor angiogenesis, metastasis and drug resistance [20–22].
We previously reported that reduction of p-705-Stat3 or
HIF-1α accumulation could overcome drug resistance
[6, 11]. Stat3 has also been shown to form transcription
complexes with NFκB, which synergistically drives the
expression of the metastasis-driving factors [23]. So
tanshinone-1-induced reduction of p-705-Stat3 might also
contribute to its reported antimetastasis activity [15]. In this
study, we show that tanshinone-1 decreases p-705-Stat3
regardless of the ambient oxygen conditions in both
endothelial and tumor cells. Moreover, downregulation
of Stat3 abrogates tube formation of HMEC-1 cells and
VEGF secretion from MCF-7 cells, which is further
potentiated by tanshinone-1. These data suggest a
possibility that tanshinone-1 could inhibit angiogenesis
through the whole solid tumor, including its hypoxic and
non-hypoxic regions.
Stat3 has been demonstrated to directly promote the
expression of HIF-1α [22, 24]. However, the tanshinone1-driven reduction of hypoxia-induced HIF-1α
accumulation could not be correlated with its effect on
Stat3 in either endothelial or tumor cells. In the identicallytreated endothelial cells, tanshinone-1 reduces p-705-Stat3
but only slightly lowers HIF-1α accumulation. Abrogating
the expression of HIF-1α does not block the tube
formation or obviously change the effect of tanshinone-1

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that tanshinone-1
inhibits tumor angiogenesis in both direct and indirect
ways. Tanshinone-1 directly suppresses proliferation,
migration and tube formation (differentiation) of
endothelial cells, which could be amplified indirectly
by its reducing the secretion of VEGF from tumor cells.
Tanshinone-1 attenuates the sprouting of rat aortic rings
and the neovascularization of the chick chorioallantoic
membrane. The data suggest that tanshinone-1 could
not only block the endothelial-cell-mediated initiation
stage but also impair the whole process of angiogenesis.
In solid tumors, besides, tanshinone-1 reduces VEGF
paracrine from tumor cells, which might prevent the
stimulation of VEGF on endothelial cells (Figure 6),
further strengthening its antiangiogenesis activity.

on the tube formation either. Similarly in tumor cells,
tanshinone-1 does not alter the mRNA levels of HIF-1α
in tumor cells whereas the proteosome inhibitor MG-132
prevents the reduction of HIF-1α accumulation induced
by tanshinone-1. These data indicate that tanshinone-1
inhibits Stat3 and HIF-1α possibly by independent
mechanisms. In contrast, these independent changes in
Stat3 and HIF-1α induced by tanshinone-1 synergistically
inhibit the tube formation of endothelial cells and the
VEGF secretion from tumor cells.
Together, as an angiogenesis inhibitor, tanshinone-1
displays unique characteristics as follows. 1) Tanshinone-1
reduces p-705-Stat3 possibly by certain unknown
approach(es) different from those used by the known
Stat3 inhibitors [25] as we reported previously [11].
2) Tanshinone-1 lowers the accumulation of HIF-1α,
a principal regulator of hypoxia, in tumor cells, which
could alleviate the ill biological effects of hypoxia. On
the other hand, its direct tumor cell killing might ease the
demand for oxygen in the tumor. Both help to improve
tumor treatment [1]. 3) Tanshinone-1 has been shown
to overcome tumor drug resistance [11] and inhibit
metastasis [15], which might help to prevent and/or
delay treatment resistance and metastasis resulting from
antiangiogenic therapy [1]. 4) Importantly, tanshinone-1 is
one of major active ingredients of Danshen, and Danshen
has been safely used in the clinic for a very long time.
Moreover, tanshinone-1 itself possesses therapeutic effects
on cardiovascular diseases [12]. Thus, tanshinone-1
might have good safety and especially avoid causing
severe cardiovascular toxicities that frequently occur in
the use of most antiangiogenic agents at present. These
characteristics could be reasonable to make tanshinone-1
distinct from other angiogenesis inhibitors. However, its
drug development as an angiogenesis inhibitor requires
further demonstrating its molecular mechanisms and
improving its biological activity and physicochemical
properties, both of which are underway.

for the following tube formation and cell migration assays,
HMEC-1 cells (2 × 105 cells per well for a 6-h assay and
2.5 × 104 cells per well for a 4-h assay) were seeded to
96-well plates and then treated with gradient

Chilled liquid Matrigel was dispensed onto 96-well
plates (50 μL per well) and allowed to solidify (37°, 1 h)
[27]. Then HMEC-1 cells or HUVEC cells (2.5 × 104
cells per well) were seeded onto the gel and cultured in
the medium containing tanshinone-1 at 37° for 4 h. The
enclosed networks of complete tubes from three randomly
chosen fields were counted and photographed under a

staying on the upper face of the transwell membrane were
removed with a cotton swab. The migrated cells on the
lower side of the transwell membrane were fixed with

in 0.1 M borate and 2% ethanol (pH 9.0). After being
photographed, the stained cells were subsequently

Aortic ring sprouting assays

ELISA kinase assays

Aortic rings from 6-week-old Sprague Dawley rats
[28, 29] were dissected into 1-mm-long rings. The rings
were embedded with 70-μL Matrigel, allowed to solidify
(37°, 1 h) and then incubated with tanshinone-1 in the
serum-free M199 medium for 7 days. The aortic ring
sprouts were photographed with a microscope (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). All animal procedures and experiments
complied with the ethical Guidelines for the care and use
of animals and were approved by the Institute Animal
Review Boards of the Shanghai Institute of Materia
Medica at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

MCF-7 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a
density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well. After attachment, the
medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented
with 1% FBS, and the cells were treated with tanshinone-1
at hypoxia or normoxia for 16 h. Cell supernatants were
collected, and pellets were harvested by trypsinization to
calculate the cell number. The amount of VEGF in the
supernatant was determined with a human VEGF-ELISA
kit (Multi Sciences, Shanghai, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. VEGF was expressed as

Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated in an
egg incubator (Lyon, CA) at 37° and 50% humidity for
7 days. Then the alive embryos were chosen and the
chorioallantoic membranes were treated with different
concentrations of tanshinone-1 (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10,
100 μM) dried on coverslips for 48 h, as described
previously [30]. The vascular images were captured by
stereomicroscopic photography (MSS, Leica, Swizerland).
Antiangiogenic effect was detected by counting the
number of blood vessel branch points under the coverslips
with tanshinone-1 (the right side of each image) or just
with the vehicle (the left side of each image). At least
10 viable embryos were enrolled for each concentration
group.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
Cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNA
using RNAi Max (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The sequences of siRNA were as follows:
5′-GUUUGGAAAUAAU GGUGAATT-3′ (siStat3-1) and
5′-GAGUUGAAUUAUCAGCUUATT-3′ (siStat3-2) for
stat3; 5′-CACCAUGAUAUGUUUACUATT-3′ (siHIF1α-1) and 5′-AGGACAAGUCACAACAGGAUU-3′
(siHIF-1α-2) for hif-1α; and 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUC
ACGUTT-3′ as negative control (siCtrl). These siRNA
sequences were synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma Co.
Ltd (Shanghai, China).

Western blotting analyses

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The tested endothelial cells and tumor cells (1.5 × 105
cells per well) were exposed to different concentrations
of tanshinone-1 at hypoxic or normoxic conditions for the
indicated time. Then the cellular levels of proteins were
determined as previously described [31–34].
