ABSTRACT
Curcumin (Cur) has been extensively studied in several types of malignancies
including colorectal cancer (CRC); however its clinical application is greatly affected
by low bioavailability. Several strategies to improve the therapeutic response of Cur
are being pursued, including its combination with small molecules and drugs. We
investigated the therapeutic efficacy of Cur in combination with the small molecule
tolfenamic acid (TA) in CRC cell lines. TA has been shown to inhibit the growth of human
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, via targeting the transcription factor specificity protein1
(Sp1) and suppressing survivin expression. CRC cell lines HCT116 and HT29 were
treated with TA and/or Cur and cell viability was measured 24–72 hours post-treatment.
While both agents caused a steady reduction in cell viability, following a clear dose/
time-dependent response, the combination of TA+Cur showed higher growth inhibition
when compared to either single agent. Effects on apoptosis were determined using flow
cytometry (JC-1 staining to measure mitochondrial membrane potential), Western blot
analysis (c-PARP expression) and caspase 3/7 activity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
levels were measured by flow cytometry and the translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus
was determined using immunofluorescence. Results showed that apoptotic markers
and ROS activity were significantly upregulated following combination treatment, when
compared to the individual agents. This was accompanied by decreased expression of
Sp1, survivin and NF-kB translocation. The combination of TA+Cur was more effective
in HCT116 cells than HT29 cells. These results demonstrate that TA may enhance the
anti-proliferative efficacy of Cur in CRC cells.

INTRODUCTION

the etiology of this disease and the incorporation of novel
chemotherapy and biological agents, the prevalence
of colon cancer and the mortality associated with this
malignancy are very high and remain a serious concern in
cancer care. Early detection and treatment can immensely
affect the survival of patients (5-year survival rate of up
to 90%). However, in patients with metastasis the survival
rate drops to 10% [2]. Almost half of the patients with

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading
causes of mortality among both males and females in
the United States. It is estimated that 69,090 men and
63,610 women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer
in 2015 and 26,100 men and 23,600 women will die of the
disease [1]. Despite the advances made in understanding

colon cancer will develop recurrent disease, suggesting
that there is potential for improvement in current treatment
regimens and the need to develop novel therapies.
Standard treatment includes surgery followed by adjuvant
therapy with oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil, (FOLFOX)
and leucovorin [3]. Although chemotherapeutic regimens
containing FOLFOX produce a response in the majority
of cases, virtually all responses are incomplete and the
emergence of resistance, with subsequent recurrence, can
occur in the majority of cases. Hence, there is a need to
identify novel compounds that are non-toxic and that can
be used in combination therapies to enhance the response
of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.
Recently there has been an increasing interest in
using compounds of natural origin, particularly from
dietary sources, for the treatment and prevention of
various diseases including cancers [4]. Curcumin (Cur), in
particular, has been extensively tested in preclinical studies
for its therapeutic effect in several cancers including colon,
pancreatic, prostate, gastric, hepatic, and leukemia [5].
Cur (diferuloylmethane) is the major active ingredient of
turmeric derived from Curcuma longa, abundantly used in
Southeast Asian countries. It has no discernable toxicity
and has been shown to inhibit the growth of transformed
cells and colon carcinogenesis at the initiation, promotion
and progression stages in carcinogen-induced rodent
models [6, 7]. Cur has also been shown to prevent
the development of adenomas in the intestinal tract of
Min +/− mice, a model of human familial adenomatous
polyposis [8]. Cur is currently in multiple clinical trials.
In a phase I and II clinical trials, curcumin has been found
to be effective in inhibiting the growth of a variety of
tumors [9–11], and shown to significantly reduce aberrant
crypt foci formations that act as biomarkers for colon
carcinogenesis [12]. Besides its anticancer activity, studies
have demonstrated its chemopreventive properties in vitro
and in animal models [13].
The anti-cancer and preventive properties of Cur
are partly attributed to its ability to inhibit COX-2.
Numerous studies have also demonstrated that COX-2
plays an important role in the development of colorectal
cancer. A recent study demonstrated that the combination
of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
celecoxib (a specific COX-2 inhibitor) or its structural
analog SC236 with Cur resulted in synergistic growth
inhibition of colon cancer cells [14]. The possible
mechanism involves both COX-2-dependent induction
of apoptosis along with non-COX-2-dependent pathways.
Similar results were also observed with the combination
of another NSAID, diclofenac with Cur [15]. However,
studies have also clearly demonstrated that the use of
traditional NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors is associated
with increased risk of gastrointestinal damage and
adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, this study was
carried out to examine the effects of combining Cur and
tolfenamic acid (TA) on colon cancer cells. TA is an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NSAID that is primarily used in the treatment of migraine
headaches [16, 17]. Research from our laboratory and
others has demonstrated the anticancer activity of TA
in various cancers including prostate, lung, ovarian,
pancreatic, and pediatric cancers like neuroblastoma,
medulloblastoma, and leukemia [18– 24]. TA is currently
being investigated in a Phase I clinical trial along with
gemcitabine and radiation for treating pancreatic cancer
patients. The rationale for using TA in this study includes
its limited side effects and an overlap in pathways that are
also targeted by Cur, namely then NF-κB signaling and
the Sp1 transcription factor [25–27].
In this study we found that the combination of Cur
and TA resulted in an increased inhibition of CRC cell
growth via the induction of apoptosis when compared
to individual agents. This investigation also revealed the
efficacy of the combination treatment in modulating the
expression of transcription factors Sp1 and NF-κB and
anti-apoptotic protein survivin, altering ROS levels and
mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibiting the
nuclear translocation of NF-κB.

RESULTS
Combination of Cur and TA results in increased
inhibition of cell growth
The effect of TA and Cur on CRC (HCT116 and
HT29) cell proliferation was evaluated by the CellTiter- Glo
luminescent cell viability assay. Data from the dose graphs
was used to calculate the IC50 values (Supplementary
Figures S1 & S2) for the individual drugs. Based on these
results, the doses for TA and Cur were selected to test
the combination effect. HCT116 and HT29 cells were
treated with increasing concentrations of TA (0, 25, 50,
75, 100 µM) or Cur (0, 1, 5, 7.5, 10 µM). Cell viability
was evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment using the
CellTiter-Glo assay kit as described in the methods (Figures
1 and 2). In HCT116 cells, the IC50 values for TA and Cur
were 70.3 µM and 13.46 µM at 24 h and 47.8 µM and 3.6
µM at 48 h, respectively. In HT29 cells, the IC50 values for
TA and Cur were 55.3 µM and 12.9 µM at 24 h and 46.8
µM and 4.7 µM at 48 h, respectively. As seen in Figures
1 and 2, TA and Cur decreased cell viability in a dose and
time-dependent manner that demonstrates their potent anticancer activity IC50.
To examine the effects of combined treatment with
TA+Cur, HCT116 and HT29 cells were treated with
50 µM TA and 7.5 µM Cur and viable cells were measured
at 24 and 48 h post-treatment. Interestingly, combination
treatment resulted in a reduction of cell viability in both
HCT116 (24 h: 58%; 48 h: 91%) and HT29 (24 h: 51%;
48 h: 89%) cells (Figure 3). These results suggest that the
combination treatment was more effective in inhibiting the
proliferation of both HCT116 and HT29 cells compared to
single treatment with TA or Cur.

Induction of ROS levels following cur treatment

To address issues of NSAID associated cardiotoxicity, we treated cardiomyocytes H9C2 with increasing
dose TA (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 µM) for 48 h. As seen in
Figure 4, TA did not have any cytotoxic effect on these cells.

The effect of Cur, TA or TA+Cur on ROS levels
was determined in both CRC cell lines following 24 h
treatment. While both TA and Cur increased the levels
of ROS in both cell lines, the combination of TA+Cur
led to a much greater elevation than either individual
agent (Figure 7). TA increased ROS by 1.6 and 1.4 fold,
respectively, in HCT116 and HT29 cells. Cur caused
2.2 (HCT116) and 1.5 (HT29) fold increase while the
combination treatment induced ROS levels by 2.7 fold in
HCT116 and 1.8 fold in HT29 cells.

Combination treatment results in loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential and induces
PARP cleavage and survivin downregulation
Mitochondria play a key role in propagating
apoptotic signals. Induction of apoptosis via mitochondrial
pathways results in the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential. We therefore examined the effect of TA and/or
curcumin on the change in mitochondrial potential (Δψm)
by JC-1 staining. HCT116 and HT29 cells were treated
with TA or Cur alone or in combination and the changes
in membrane potential were assessed at 24 and 48 h posttreatment using the JC-1 dye. Quantitative analysis using
flow cytometry revealed that the percentage of cells with
loss of Δψm increased following treatment with TA+Cur,
(Figure 5). The disruption of membrane potential (ratio
of red and green fluorescence) in response to TA+Cur
treatment showed a clear trend in HCT116 cells (Con: 5.02
vs TA+Cur: 2.72); however this trend was not obvious in
HT29 cells (Con: 17. 52 vs TA+Cur: 11.05).

Cur and TA treatment downregulates Sp1 and
NF-κB transcription factors
To further examine the mechanism by which the
combination of TA+Cur inhibits cell proliferation of HCT116
and HT29 cells, we examined their effect on some of the
known key proteins/pathways targeted by the individual
agents. Previous studies with TA or Cur have shown that
they both target the Sp transcription factor and the NF- κB
signaling pathway in colon cancer cells. The effect of
combination treatment on Sp1 and NF-κB expression was
determined by Western blot. As shown in Figure 8A, TA
and Cur treatment alone decreased the expression of Sp1
in both cell lines and this effect was augmented following
the combination treatment. NF- κB expression was
downregulated only in Cur treated cells, but not in TA treated
cells. However, a significant reduction in NF-κB levels was
seen in cells treated with a combination of both TA+Cur.
The effect of these treatments on TNFα induced
translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus was evaluated
by immunofluorescence. The examination of NF-kB
staining in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells revealed
certain differences between treated samples. As seen in
Figure  8B, TNFα treatment results in the translocation
of NF-κB (red fluorescence) from the cytoplasm into the
nucleus (blue, DAPI stained). Both TA and Cur are able
to inhibit this translocation. However, the combination of
TA+Cur resulted in a significantly decreased translocation
of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to nucleus when compared
to control, TA, or Cur alone treated cells.

Cur and TA combination induces caspase 3/7 activity
To determine whether the decrease in cell
proliferation with the combination treatment was
associated with an induction of apoptotic markers,
activity of caspase 3 and 7 was measured. HCT116
and HT29 cells were treated with TA (50 µM) and Cur
(7.5 µM) alone and in combination and caspase 3/7 activity
was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit, at 24
and 48 h post-treatment. As shown in Figure 6A, caspase
3/7 activity was markedly increased in cells treated with
the combination of TA+Cur (3.6 and 2.7 fold) compared
to single agent treatment with TA (2.3 and 1.7 fold) or Cur
(1.7 and 1.8 fold) in HCT116 and HT29 cells, respectively.
These results corroborated the findings of cell viability
(Figure  3), suggesting the association of decreased
proliferation of cells with the induction of apoptosis.
We also looked at the downstream targets of the
apoptotic activation cascade, such as cleavage of PARP
protein, and levels of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin,
using Western blot (Figure 6B). We observed an increase
in the levels of cleaved PARP in both HCT116 and HT29
cells at 24 h post-treatment. Also, levels of survivin were
decreased in cells treated with TA+Cur combination
compared to single drug treatments. Taken together, these
results confirm that the inhibition of proliferation by the
combination treatment could be the result of activation of
apoptosis as demonstrated by an increase in caspase 3/7
activity and PARP cleavage and the downregulation of the
anti-apoptotic protein survivin.

DISCUSSION
Cur has been extensively characterized for its anticancer activity in various cancers including CRC [5, 28].
Cur is an attractive therapeutic molecule as it displays a
broad spectrum of activities and affects multiple proteins
and pathways during the pre-initiation, initiation, and
progressive stages of colon cancer. One of the major
problems associated with the clinical use of Cur is its poor
systemic availability [29]. To improve the bioavailability
of Cur various strategies are being explored including
novel formulations for delivery [30], synthesizing
3191

Oncotarget

structural analogs with more potent activity and increased
bioavailability [31]. Studies are also being carried out to
increase the therapeutic efficacy by using combination
therapy of Cur with chemotherapeutic drugs [32–34]. In
this study we used a combination of TA and Cur. Both TA
and Cur showed the ability to inhibit the growth of CRC
cells and this inhibition is significantly increased when
both agents are combined together (Figures 1–3). The loss
of cell viability also correlated with loss of membrane
potential (Figure 5) and an increase in apoptosis
(Figure 6). We also carried out studies to determine
if the effect is synergistic or additive or antagonistic
with the combination of TA and Cur, by calculating the
combination index (CI) using two different combinations.
At the IC50 doses for TA and Cur we observed an additive
response (CI – 0.9–1.1) between the two drugs in both
the cells lines. At the doses (TA: 50 µM; Cur: 7.5 µM)
used for the experiments in this manuscript, we observed
additive response only in HCT116 cells. In HT29 cells, CI

was not showing additive or synergistic effect; however
the combination of TA+Cur resulted in higher growth
inhibitory response when compared to single agent.
NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that
is present in the cytoplasm. In response to various
inflammatory stimuli, NF-κB translocates into the
nucleus where it is known to transcriptionally activate
several genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation,
invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and suppression of
apoptosis [35]. Its association with cancer cell survival and
resistance to chemotherapy makes it an attractive target
for anti-cancer therapies. In CRC, both TA and Cur have
been shown to modulate the NF-κB signaling pathway
[25, 26, 36]. In the presence of inflammatory stimuli,
TA prevented inflammatory cytokine-induced NF- κB
activation by inhibiting its translocation to the nucleus
[25]. It has also been reported that TA has the ability to
downregulate NF-κB expression in HCT116 colon cancer
cells [37]. In this study, we found that TA alone did not

affect the levels of NF-κB; however the combination of
TA+Cur inhibited NF-kB protein expression more than
that caused by Cur alone (Figure 8A), suggesting that TA
enhances the ability of Cur to downregulate NF-κB. We

also observed that inflammatory stimuli-induced (TNFα)
nuclear translocation of NF-κB was significantly inhibited
by both TA and Cur and this effect was further enhanced
by the combination treatment of TA+Cur (Figure 8B).

Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (IAP) family and is highly expressed in various
human cancers, including colon cancer, and its expression
correlates with tumor stage and poor progression [38,
39]. Survivin has also been shown to regulate mitotic
spindle checkpoint, angiogenesis, and cause resistance
of tumor cells to radiation and chemotherapy, making
it an ideal tumor marker and a therapeutic target [40].
NSAIDs with anti-cancer activity such as celecoxib and
indomethacin have been shown to inhibit the expression
of survivin [41, 42]. Research from our laboratory
has shown that TA (small molecule and NSAID)
downregulates the expression of survivin in various
cancers including pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, leukemia,
and medulloblastoma [18, 20, 22, 24]. Promoter analysis
of the survivin gene shows the presence of Sp1 binding
sites, suggesting its regulation by the Sp1 transcription
factor [43, 44]. We have shown that TA inhibits the
expression of Sp1 transcription factor, which in turn might
be responsible for regulating survivin expression. Studies
have shown that Cur also has the ability to downregulate
the expression of Sp transcription factors in CRC cells
[36, 45]. In agreement with these reports, results from
this study show that both Cur and TA downregulate
survivin and Sp1 transcription factor in HCT116 and
HT29 cells (Figures 6B, 8A). Results also demonstrate
that combination treatment with TA+Cur caused greater
downregulation of Sp1 compared to single drug treatment,
resulting in an increase in the suppression of survivin. This
downregulation of survivin by the combination treatment
might contribute towards the apoptotic cell death.
Increase in ROS levels is known to play a role in
tumor initiation and also acts as a chemotherapeutic
strategy to inhibit tumor growth. Both Cur and TA have
been shown to increase ROS levels in colon cancer cells.
TA-induced ROS results in DNA damage and subsequent
activation of NF-κB and ATF3 [46]. Curcumin on the other
hand was shown to mediate the effect of increased ROS
by downregulating microRNAs (miR-27a and miR-20a)
which in turn results in decrease in Sp1 and its downstream
targets [45]. Our results demonstrate that the combination
of TA+Cur results in an increase in ROS levels compared
to single drug treatment (Figure 7). We have also shown
that Sp1 levels are downregulated by treatment with TA
and Cur (Figure 8A). Taken together our results suggest
that the increase in ROS by the combination treatment
leads to inhibition of Sp1 expression. This is in agreement
with the study showing that downregulation of Sp1 by Cur
is ROS-dependent [45].
Both Cur and TA have shown anti-cancer activity
in multiple cancers including CRC [18–20, 25, 47–49]
by targeting NF-κB and Sp1 respectively. Interestingly,
there is overlap in some of the targets for these two
agents [25, 36, 45]. In this study, we demonstrated that
the combination of Cur and TA enhanced the inhibition
of Sp1, NF-kB and survivin and upregulated the levels
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of ROS and apoptotic markers such as PARP cleavage
and effector caspase activity. We also show that TA,
unlike other NSAIDs, did not exhibit any cardio-toxicity
(Figure 4). These studies provide highly encouraging
evidence to support testing of this novel combination to
increase therapeutic efficacy in CRC. Cur is currently
under investigation in 117 clinical trials for various
human diseases and about half (52) of these studies
(mostly in combination studies) are in cancer of different
types (clinicaltrials.gov). TA is being explored in a Phase
I clinical trial to test its activity in pancreatic cancer
patients along with gemcitabine and radiation. Favorable
results from studies of the TA and Cur combination in
animal models will help move our experimental strategy
into clinical practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Human colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116 and
HT29 and cardiomyocytes H9C2 were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA). Colon cancer cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A
medium, H9C2 cells were grown in DMEM medium and
supplemented with fetal bovine serum and maintained in a
humidified incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Tolfenamic acid, curcumin, and DMSO were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies against
cPARP and NF-κB were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technologies (Beverly, MA), Sp1 and HRP-conjugated
mouse anti-rabbit antibody from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz,
CA), survivin from R&D (Minneapolis, MN), and β-actin
from Sigma.

Cell proliferation assay
The effect of TA and Cur on cell proliferation
was determined by measuring cellular ATP levels as
an indication of viable cells using the CellTiter-Glo
(luminescent cell viability assay kit from Promega,
Madison, WI). Briefly, HCT116, HT29, and H9C2 cells
were seeded in white-walled clear-bottom 96-well plates.
After 24 h, cells were treated with solvent (DMSO)
or various concentrations of TA and Cur alone and in
combination. Cell viability was assessed at various time
points by adding the CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
treated in triplicate and data were normalized to solvent
control and reported as percentage of viable cells.

Caspase activation
The induction of apoptosis was determined by
measuring caspase 3/7 activity using the Caspase-Glo
3/7 Assay kit (Promega). HCT116 and HT29 cells were
3197

Oncotarget

Estimation of reactive oxygen species

seeded in 96-well plates and treated as described above.
Activation of caspase 3 and 7 was measured by adding
the Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Luminescence values from each well,
corresponding to caspase 3/7 activity, were measured.
Cells were treated in triplicate and data normalized
to solvent control and reported as fold change in caspase
3/7 activity.

The levels of ROS were measured with an oxidative
stress indicator, CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen) via flow
cytometry. Briefly, CRC cells were treated with TA, Cur
or TA+Cur for 24 h. H2O2 was used as a positive control
to induce ROS. Cells were harvested and incubated with
5 µM of CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37°C in the dark.
Fluorescence was quantified by a BD FACSCalibur and
the results were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star Inc,
Ashland, OR). Geometric mean fluorescence was used as
the average fluorescence value for each population.

Mitochondrial membrane potential
Depolarization of mitochondrial membrane
potential and the subsequent activation of caspases is
the hallmark of apoptosis. Mitochondrial membrane
potential (Δψ) in cells treated with TA, Cur or
TA+Cur combination was measured using the JC-1
dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The dye exists as a
monomer at low concentrations with green fluorescence
(Em 530 nm) and accumulates in the mitochondria
as aggregates with orange-red fluorescence (Em
590 nm). During apoptosis there is a disruption in
the mitochondrial membrane potential that can be
monitored by the shift in fluorescence from red to green.
Briefly, following treatment with TA, Cur or TA+Cur,
cells were harvested and incubated with 5 µM JC1 dye
for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were washed, resuspended
in fresh medium and analyzed using a FACS Caliber
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data
was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc,
Ashland, OR) and represented as a dot plot of green
versus red fluorescence. Apoptosis was determined
by the increase in red fluorescence (aggregates)
accompanied by loss of green fluorescence (monomers).

NF-kB immunofluorescence
HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cells were
grown on coverslips in a 6-well dish overnight. NF-κB
translocation was induced by treating cells with TNFα
(15 ng/ml). Cells were simultaneously treated with TA
(50  µM), Cur (7.5 µM) or a combination of TA+Cur for
24 h. After treatment, cells were fixed with cold methanol
for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS and blocked
with 10% normal goat serum for 1 hr. Cells were then
incubated with NF-κB antibody (1:200) for 2 h, washed
with 0.1% PBS-Tween and incubated with goat anti-rabbit
antibody (1:400) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 for 2 h.
Cells were washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides
using Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired
using Olympus AX70 upright fluorescence microscope.

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using one way ANOVA.
Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. Significance
between treated and untreated cells were evaluated and p
value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Protein extraction and western blotting
Protein lysates for Western blot experiments were
prepared using lysis buffer consisting of cell extraction
buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma). Briefly, cells were harvested at 24
and 48 h post-treatment and the cell pellets were resuspended in cold cell lysis buffer, incubated for 30 min
on ice, and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm. Protein
concentration in the supernatant (cell lysate) was estimated
using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). For Western blot, 25–30 µg protein was
separated on 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot transfer system
(Invitrogen). The membrane was blocked with 5% milkTBST and probed with primary antibodies against, Sp1,
survivin, cPARP, NF-κB, and β-actin. Membranes were
washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed
using Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and images acquired using
BioSpectrum Imaging System (UVP).
