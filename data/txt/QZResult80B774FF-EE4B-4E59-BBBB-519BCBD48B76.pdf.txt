Abstract
Tumor-educated macrophages facilitate tumor metastasis and
angiogenesis. We discovered that granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) blocked macrophages
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activity by producing soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1) and determined the
effect on tumor-associated macrophage behavior and tumor
growth. We show GM-CSF treatment of murine mammary
tumors slowed tumor growth and slowed metastasis. These
tumors had more macrophages, fewer blood vessels, and lower
oxygen concentrations. This effect was sVEGFR-1 dependent.
In situ hybridization and flow cytometry identified macrophages as the primary source of sVEGFR-1. These data suggest
that GM-CSF can re-educate macrophages to reduce angiogenesis and metastases in murine breast cancer. [Cancer Res
2009;69(5):2133–40]

Introduction
Cells in the tumor environment facilitate tumor growth and
spread. Tumor cells influence endothelial cells, macrophages, T cells,
and fibroblasts to evade host defenses, undergo angiogenesis, and
produce factors that promote growth, survival, and metastases (1).
Tumors grow through signals elicited from cells in their
microenvironment. For instance, some tumors down-regulate
immune surveillance molecules to avoid attack by T cells and
natural killer cells (2, 3). Some secrete growth factors that stimulate
blood vessel formation (4). Other tumors stop making molecules
that maintain cell-cell interactions (5). Changes tumors impose on
surrounding cells are called ‘‘tumor education’’ (6), and often
represent an inappropriate triggering of developmental programs
within the tumor cells (7).
One type of immune cell, the macrophage, plays an important
role in normal breast tissue development. Macrophage activity,
stimulated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), is
essential for normal breast development (8). In breast tumors,
macrophages constitute up to 35% of the infiltrating inflammatory
cells (9). These tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) produce
factors that facilitate tumor invasion and angiogenesis, such as

matrix metalloproteinases (10) and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF; ref. 11).
The cytokine milieu in the tumor microenvironment dictates
macrophage behavior. Many breast tumors secrete M-CSF, which is
expressed in over 70% of human breast cancers (12). Serum M-CSF
levels correlate with tumor size, metastasis, and poor outcomes in
humans (13, 14). Mice deficient in M-CSF are protected against
breast tumor metastasis, and re-expressing M-CSF solely in the
breast tissue restores metastatic activity (15). This effect likely
involves both an M-CSF/EGF paracrine loop between tumors and
macrophages (16) and M-CSF–induced VEGF production (11),
inducing angiogenesis (17).
In sharp contrast, granulocyte M-CSF (GM-CSF)–stimulated
monocytes exhibit antitumor behavior. GM-CSF enhances macrophage antigen presentation and immune responsiveness (18). We
showed that GM-CSF stimulates monocytes to secrete VEGF
receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1), which binds and inactivates VEGF and
blocks angiogenesis (19). Angiogenesis within the tumors is
necessary for tumor progression, as tumors cannot grow beyond
a few cubic millimeters without blood vessel formation to supply
oxygen and nutrients (20, 21).
Recent studies illustrate the importance of sVEGFR-1 in blocking
cancer progression. For example, low intratumor sVEGFR-1 and
high total VEGF are associated with poor disease-free and overall
survival (22). Toi and colleagues (23) found that tumors with
10-fold more sVEGFR-1 than VEGF have a favorable prognosis.
Other studies show similar findings for patients with colorectal
cancer (24), glioblastoma (25), and acute myeloid leukemia (26).
These observations led us to speculate that macrophage
behavior was manipulated in vivo by GM-CSF. We wanted to
know whether the TAM phenotype was reversed by GM-CSF within
the tumor microenvironment. We show that intratumor GM-CSF
injections reversed some of the effects of tumor education and
induced an antitumor phenotype in TAMs.

Materials and Methods
Mice. PyMT transgenic mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory. Mammary tumors from PyMT transgenics were removed and
orthotopically injected into normal FVB female mice for these studies.
Tumor injections. MET-1 tumor cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 Ag/mL insulin, and 5 ng/mL rhEGF.
These cells were resuspended in DMEM medium at 500,000 cells/100 AL.
The cells were orthotopically injected into the number four mammary fat
pads of normal female FVB mice (allografts).
Treatment study. After tumors became palpable, mice were randomized to treatment groups. PBS or 100 ng rmGM-CSF in 50 AL was
administered directly into the tumor. For longer time point studies, mice

were treated until their tumors reached 2 cm in diameter. For short time
point studies, seven treatments were administered (thrice per week). Tumor
dimensions and mouse weight were measured weekly for long time point
studies or at each treatment for shorter studies. For studies analyzing the
effect of neutralizing sVEGFR-1 in combination with GM-CSF treatment,
tumors were orthotopically injected. Either PBS, 100 ng rmGM-CSF, 100 ng
rmGM-CSF + 4 Ag anti–VEGF receptor-1 neutralizing antibody (R&D
Systems; AF471), 100 ng rmGM-CSF + 4 Ag isotype IgG control (goat), or 4
Ag anti–VEGF receptor-1 neutralizing antibody alone in 50 AL was injected
directly into the tumors.
Electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry. Lithium octa-n-butoxy
2,3-naphthalocyanine (LiNc-BuO) microcrystals were a gift from Dr.
Periannan Kuppusamy, The Ohio State University. Ten-microgram microcrystals were resuspended in 500 AL DMEM. Twenty-five microliters of this
suspension were added to 5  105 PyMT cells for each 100 AL injection.
Oxygen measurements were performed immediately, weekly, and upon
sacrifice using in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry.
Measurements of tumor oxygenation were performed using an L-band
in vivo EPR spectrometer (L-band; Magnettech). Mice were placed in a right,
lateral position with their tumor close to the surface coil resonator. EPR
spectra were acquired as single 30-s scans. The instrument settings were as
follows: incident microwave power, 4 mW; modulation amplitude, 180 mG;
modulation frequency, 100 kHz; receiver time constant, 0.2 s. The peak-topeak width of the EPR spectrum was used to calculate pO2 using a standard
calibration curve. Three-dimensional imaging was performed as described
previously (27).
Evaluation of angiogenesis. Texas red–conjugated dextran (mol wt
70,000; Molecular Probes) was prepared to 6.2 mg/mL in PBS and injected
via the tail vein at 20 Ag/g of mouse body weight. The mice were sacrificed
5 min after administration. Tumor sections were analyzed blindly for
fluorescence using a confocal microscope with a 10 objective lens and
image insets with a 5 zoom. Functional blood vessels (Texas red–dextran
positive) were identified and quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS2.
Evaluation of necrosis. Necrotic tissue within the tumors of mice was
evaluated as described (Achilles and colleagues, 2001). Necrosis was
quantified in a blinded manner using histogram analysis in Adobe
Photoshop CS2 software for the presence of green pixels.
Tumor metastases. The lungs from mice implanted with tumor cells
and treated with GM-CSF or PBS were removed, insufflated, fixed in
formalin, and stained with hematoxylin. Tumor cell metastases were
evaluated by subjecting the lungs to Bright Field light under a
stereomicroscope. Each tumor incident was counted in a blinded manner.
In situ hybridization. Our protocol for detection of RNAs by in situ
hybridization has been previously published (28).
Immunohistochemistry. To identify cells producing VEGF or sVEGFR-1
mRNA, serial sections of the tumors were cut and stained for F4/80+ cells.
Our immunohistochemical detection protocol is published (28). For
identification of cell infiltrates in response to treatment, mammary tumors
were stained to identify F4/80+ (macrophages) and 7/4 (neutrophils) as well
as H&E. Total cell influx was analyzed by digital images of the entire tumors
and quantified using histogram analysis in Adobe Photoshop CS2 software
for brown pixels.
Immunofluorescence. Macrophage phenotype was determined on
tumor sections stained. With primary antibodies: goat anti-mouse arginase
I (Santa Cruz; sc-18351) and rabbit anti-mouse iNOS (Abcam; ab15323), at
1:200 dilutions. Secondary antibodies used were chicken anti-goat–Alexa
488 and chicken anti-rabbit–Alexa 594 (Invitrogen). Adjacent tissue sections
were processed with primary antibodies omitted (secondaries only). Images
were captured on a Zeiss confocal microscope using a 63 objective lens.
Flow cytometry. PyMT+ FVB female mice with palpable tumors had
injections of PBS or GM-CSF into mammary pad number 4 or 9. After 4 wk,
mice were euthanized and their tumors were removed. Immune cells were
separated from tumor by centrifugation over a ficoll density gradient. The
buffy layer was removed and resuspended in cold fluorescence-activated
cell sorting buffer. One half of the cells was incubated 5 min on ice with rat
IgG, and then stained with PE anti-mouse FLT-1 or isotype. The other half
was permeabilized with the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit, incubated 5 min with

rat IgG, then stained with the same antibodies. Both sets of samples were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, then run on a BD FACScalibur flow
cytometer. Analysis was performed using DeNovo FCS Express v3.
Tumor extracellular fluid analyses. Snap-frozen tumor samples from
mice treated with PBS (9 samples) or GM-CSF (14 samples) were crushed
into fragments <2 mm in diameter and resuspended with 1:2 weight/volume
of 2 PBS and rotated at 4jC for 2 h. The samples were vortexed then spun
for 3 min at 5,000 RPM. The fluid was subjected to cytokine analysis using
the Bio-Rad Bioplex for interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, M-CSF, and VEGF.
Statistical analyses. For data comparing single independent measurements between two treatment groups, Mann-Whitney U test was used to
determine whether observations could have come from identical distributions (metastases, tissue necrosis, immunohistochemical stains). The
similar nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used when comparing more
than two groups (Texas red angiogenesis data). When groups were larger
and distributions approximated the normal distribution, equality of means
between groups was compared by Student’s t test. Growth data and ongoing
oximetry data were compared by repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey
post hoc testing because measures of an individual mouse from one
observation to the next were not independent. Kaplan-Meier survival
analyses used Mantel-Cox Log Rank testing to determine differences
between groups.

native PyMT+ mice with PBS or GM-CSF and compared tumor
growth. GM-CSF similarly reduced tumor growth in PyMT+
murine breast cancers, whereas PBS injections did not (data not
shown).
GM-CSF treatment correlates with reduced lung metastasis.
PyMT breast cancers metastasize to the lung (30). Because tumor
angiogenesis is essential for metastases and GM-CSF stimulates
macrophages to produce sVEGFR-1 (19), we predicted that
GM-CSF treatment reduced lung metastases. We orthotopically
injected allograft tumors into FVB mice and treated them with
GM-CSF or PBS. To enhance lung metastases, all tumors were
allowed to grow to 2 cm in diameter before the mice were removed
from the study. The lungs of these mice were insufflated, fixed
whole, and stained with hematoxylin to identify tumor masses
within the lungs (Fig. 2A). GM-CSF treatment reduced the number
of lung metastases compared with PBS (P = 0.037 by MannWhitney U, 6 mice per group; Fig. 2B).
GM-CSF lowers oxygen levels within the tumor proper. If
reduction in tumor growth and metastasis in GM-CSF–treated
mice resulted from sVEGFR-1 production and reduced angiogenesis, we predicted these mice would have reduced tumor oxygen
levels. To track oxygen concentrations within the tumors of PBSor GM-CSF–treated mice, we incubated an oxygen-sensitive

Results
Local treatment with GM-CSF slows tumor growth in a
mouse model of breast cancer. Based on our previous work (19),
we predicted treating tumors locally with GM-CSF would stimulate
TAMs to secrete sVEGFR-1, countering tumor-derived VEGF, and
blocking angiogenesis (29). To test this hypothesis, we orthotopically injected MET-1 tumor cells (derived from a PyMT+ FVB
mouse) to a single mammary gland of an FVB recipient. We chose
to use the PyMT model because (a) tumor progression in this wellcharacterized model resembles that seen in human tumors (30),
(b) these tumors readily metastasize, and (c) the orthotopic
allograft injection model maintains a fully functional immune
system in these mice. Furthermore, we could isolate the tumor site,
minimizing problems associated with tumors arising in 10 separate
mammary pads. When tumors became palpable, we randomized
the mice into groups. Mice received intratumor injections of equal
volumes of PBS or rmGM-CSF thrice per week for 3 wk. Once a
week, tumor measurements were recorded.
Mice treated with GM-CSF showed a 66% reduction in tumor
size after 3 weeks (P = 0.025; Fig. 1A). We let tumors grow until they
reached 2 cm in their greatest dimension, at which time the mice
were euthanized. Figure 1B shows a 3-week increase in median
survival (defined as time to 2-cm tumor diameter) of mice treated
with GM-CSF (3 versus 6 weeks; P = 0.010). GM-CSF–treated mice
had no significant changes in body weight or overt clinical side
effects. CBC analysis revealed no difference between treatment
groups in the concentrations of any circulating cell type (Total
WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelets; Mann-Whitney U, n = 7 mice/group). In blood
collected from mice treated with GM-CSF, serum levels of the
cytokine remained undetectable from 6 to 12 hours after
intratumor injection (<14 pg/mL; 9 mice per group).
To evaluate the role of inflammation as a variable in the
orthotopic injection model, we also injected palpable tumors in

nanoprobe (LiNc-BuO microcrystals; ref. 31) with PyMT tumor cells
until the probe was internalized and injected these cells into the
mammary fat pads of normal FVB female mice. High resolution,
three-dimensional EPR techniques analyzed oxygen tension within
the tumors. GM-CSF–treated tumors showed reduced oxygen levels
compared with tumors treated with PBS (P = 0.050 by repeated
measures ANOVA; Fig. 3). Distribution maps showed uniform probe
allocation throughout the tumor, equal between groups, and
limited in space to the tumor itself.
GM-CSF causes increased cell death within the tumor and
changes in patterns of necrosis. Depriving tumors of oxygen and
other nutrients causes cell death and tissue necrosis. To evaluate
effects of oxygen deprivation on the tumors, we used fluorescent
microscopy to assess the extent of cell death and necrosis in
H&E-stained tumor sections (32). Histologic evaluation showed
GM-CSF–treated tumors had more tissue necrosis (reflected by

enhanced fluorescence) compared with those treated with PBS
(P = 0.011 by Mann-Whitney U; Fig. 4A). All tumors analyzed for
necrosis were from mice with tumors of 2 cm diameter. Of
particular note are the patterns of necrosis. Mice treated with PBS
had focal patterns of necrosis with a single area of involvement
near the tumor’s outer surface. In contrast, GM-CSF–treated
tumors revealed diffuse, multifocal patterns of necrosis, with
smaller necrotic foci distributed throughout the tumor.
GM-CSF increases macrophage but not neutrophil numbers
in tumors. Many different cell types compose murine breast
tumors. To examine whether GM-CSF treatment altered the cell
types infiltrating the tumor, we analyzed cell influx. We found
increased F4/80+ (macrophage) staining within GM-CSF–treated
tumors (P = 0.014; Fig. 4B) but found no differences in tumor
neutrophils (7/4+ cells; 3.18% versus 4.49% 7/4+ cells, 7 and 9 mice
per group, P = 0.315 by Mann-Whitney U).

GM-CSF Inhibits Breast Tumor Growth and Metastases

Figure 5. GM-CSF treatment stimulates
the emergence of a macrophage
population that expresses VEGFR-1.
Immune cells isolated from spontaneously
arising PyMT tumors that were treated with
PBS or GM-CSF were stained with
fluorescently labeled antibodies targeting
VEGFR-1 (FLT-1) and CD68, a
macrophage marker. One set of cells (top )
was stained for surface markers, whereas
the other set (bottom ) was permeabilized
before staining, allowing analysis of
intracellular proteins. The graph shows
quantification of the relative abundance of
cells represented by the red boxes shown
on the graphs above. n = 7 tumors per
group (each mouse had one tumor injected
with PBS and one with GM-CSF). P values
of 0.012 and 0.413 by paired t tests, using
mouse as the pairing variable.

TAMs produce sVEGFR-1 in response to GM-CSF treatment.
Because GM-CSF–treated macrophages produce and release
sVEGFR-1 (19), we hypothesized that GM-CSF induced TAMs to
produce sVEGFR-1. We stained serial tumor sections for F4/80
expression and performed in situ hybridization for sVEGFR-1
mRNA expression. Grossly, GM-CSF– and vehicle-treated tumors
looked different. Vehicle-treated tumors had uniform appearance,
contrasting with irregular tissue variations seen in the GM-CSF–
treated tumors. Not only did GM-CSF increase TAMs but promoted
inflammatory nodules, containing mostly F4/80+ macrophages.
Macrophages in the GM-CSF–treated tumors produced sVEGFR-1
mRNA, especially along the interface between the nodules and
the tumor cells (Fig. 4C). PBS-treated tumors did not develop
inflammatory nodules, or express high levels of sVEGFR-1 mRNA.

Administration of GM-CSF causes a shift from M2 to M1
polarization in TAMs. Tumor-educated macrophages are usually
M2 phenotype. To test effects of GM-CSF on macrophage
polarization, we stained tumor sections for arginase I (M2
macrophages) and iNOS (M1 macrophages). Figure 4D shows that
nearly all macrophages from PBS-treated tumors had an M2
phenotype (arginase I, green). In contrast, macrophages from
GM-CSF–treated tumors exhibited M1 (iNOS, red) or transitional
(double stain, yellow) phenotype macrophages. The highest
concentrations of M1 macrophages were found near the inflammatory nodules that surrounded the necrotic tissues.
To assess whether GM-CSF administration elicited a shift in
macrophage phenotype within the tumor environment, we
extracted extracellular fluid (ECF) from snap-frozen tumor

samples and measured the M2 cytokines IL-10 and IL-4. Both of
these M2 cytokines were significantly lower in tumors treated with
GM-CSF.
Identification of sVEGFR-1–producing cells. To provide
evidence that GM-CSF stimulated sVEGFR-1 expression in macrophages, we used flow cytometry to assess cells producing this
factor. To distinguish between increased membrane-bound versus
soluble VEGFR-1, we stained cells isolated from GM-CSF– or
vehicle-treated tumors for both surface VEGFR-1 expression and
total expression (including intracellular proteins). These studies
(Fig. 5) show that the relative numbers of CD68+ cells that express
surface-bound VEGFR-1 did not change with GM-CSF treatment.
Visual inspection of the plots suggests the emergence of a CD68+
population of cells that did not express surface VEGFR-1. In
contrast, treatment with GM-CSF caused a significant increase in
a well-defined, CD68HI population of cells, all of which express
VEGFR-1.
sVEGFR expression mediates the effects of GM-CSF treatment.
We suspected that reduced tumor growth rate was dependent on

sVEGFR-1 activity. To test this hypothesis, we injected PyMT
tumor cells into the mammary fat pad of normal FVB mice.
Upon formation of a palpable tumor, the mice were randomized
to one of the following four treatment groups: PBS, GM-CSF,
GM-CSF plus a neutralizing antibody to sVEGFR-1, or GM-CSF
plus an equimolar concentration of isotype IgG control antibody.
Treatment with a neutralizing antibody to sVEGFR-1 returned
the growth rate of GM-CSF–treated tumors to near vehicletreated levels (P = 0.006 overall, P = 0.046 for GM-CSF + asVEGFR
versus GM-CSF + isotype by repeated measures ANOVA with
Tukey post hoc testing; Fig. 6A). In contrast, growth rates for
GM-CSF–treated tumors and GM-CSF plus isotype–treated
tumors were not different (P = 0.843). To ensure the results we
observed were specific for physiologic alteration of the soluble
VEGFR-1, and not confounded by binding of the antibody to the
cell surface receptors, we also compared growth rates of tumors
treated with PBS or anti–sVEGFR-1 alone. There were no
differences between these groups (P = 0.923; n = 5 mice per
group; data not shown).

GM-CSF Inhibits Breast Tumor Growth and Metastases

GM-CSF treatment reduces vessel density within the tumor.
According to our hypothesis, the lower oxygen levels observed in
GM-CSF–treated tumors resulted from a sVEGFR-1–mediated
block in angiogenesis. To test the effects of GM-CSF on blood
vessel growth within the tumor, we injected mice with Texas red–
conjugated dextran (70 kDa) 5 minutes before euthanasia. Tumors
were removed, fixed, sectioned, and analyzed by fluorescent
microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6B to C, GM-CSF treatment reduced
the number of vessels in the tumor (P = 0.023 by Kruskal-Wallis).
GM-CSF treatment reduces detectable levels of VEGF in the
tumor. Finally, when we extracted ECF from the tumors and
subjected these samples to multiplex cytokine analysis for VEGF,
we found a significant reduction in VEGF detection in the GMCSF–treated tumors (P = 0.038; Fig. 6D). Because the ELISA
antibody binds an epitope blocked by sVEGFR-1 (19), this finding is
consistent with reduced VEGF activity in the treated samples from
the actions of sVEGFR-1.

Discussion
This manuscript presents the novel observation that TAMs can
be re-educated in murine breast cancer to an antiangiogenic,
antitumor growth and M1 phenotype by local treatment of the
tumor with GM-CSF. Understanding the mechanisms of ‘‘tumor
education’’ and basic macrophage biology allowed us to identify
factors that alter macrophage behaviors within the tumor
environment. Our data show that GM-CSF can re-educate TAMs
to an antitumor phenotypes in a murine model of breast cancer
through the production of sVEGFR-1.
GM-CSF treatment slowed tumor growth and prevented lung
metastasis in our mouse model. This approach contrasts with
previous work that focused on the strategy of limiting mononuclear
phagocyte trafficking to the tumor to reduce tumor growth (15).
Our data show that reducing macrophage trafficking to murine
breast cancers is not required for therapeutic benefit, but that
re-educating the TAMs produced nearly identical effects. In our
orthotopic studies, we find increased numbers of TAMs in tumors
treated with GM-CSF, and still show improved outcomes. The
effects of GM-CSF are robust, especially in light of the aggressive
nature of the PyMT tumor model (30). To address the possibility of
the orthotopic injection inducing a local inflammatory response
that may have contributed to the antitumor effects of GM-CSF, we
performed the same studies on PyMT+ transgenic mice. We treated
a single mammary tumor with GM-CSF or PBS following the same
schedule as our orthotopic allograft model and observed similar
results (data not shown).
Because our model for lung metastases required both GM-CSF–
and PBS-treated tumors to grow to the same size before sacrifice,
lowered numbers of lung metastases suggest that GM-CSF affected
the tumor microenvironment (these PyMT tumors do not express
GM-CSF receptors). We are actively investigating if GM-CSF
treatment limited liberation of tumor cells from the primary
tumor or had alternate effects on other factors like reducing tumor
intravasation. These questions are being investigated in our
laboratory.
In the orthotopic studies, we took advantage of in vivo,
intratumor oxygen measurement by EPR as a surrogate for
angiogenic activity. Most rapidly growing tumors have large oxygen
demands. This demand must be met by the production of new
blood vessels to deliver nutrients and oxygen. We found reduced
oxygen levels within the tumors of GM-CSF–treated mice,

correlating with reduced angiogenesis. This evidence supports
the hypothesis that the production of sVEGFR-1 by TAMs blocks
functional vessel development. The effects of treatment are
especially noticeable in the three-dimensional imaging, where
effects at the border of the tumor can be separated from
measurements within the tumor (e.g., tumors in GM-CSF–treated
mice have <5 mmHg O2 across f90% of the tumor by threedimensional measures at week 3).
Altered amounts and patterns of necrosis found in GM-CSF–
treated tumors illustrate the biological significance of oxygen
deprivation, and provide outcomes which correlate with reduced
angiogenesis and oxygen delivery to the tumors. Differing patterns
of necrosis in GM-CSF–treated versus vehicle-treated tumors
correlate with macrophage distribution and behavior in the focal
nodules of inflammatory cell accumulation throughout the tumor
(see discussion of IHC and ISH below).
Reduced levels of functional angiogenesis at 3 weeks confirm
that the mechanism behind the GM-CSF effect includes angiogenic
blockade. Patterns of blood vessel growth in treated tumors seem
more like normalized or physiologic vasculature (33), as opposed
to the highly irregular, tortuous patterns of growth seen in
untreated tumors or in mice treated with neutralizing antibodies
to sVEGFR-1. These patterns correlate well with other studies
examining the biological effects of VEGF blockade in patients
treated with bevacizumab (34).
We propose that this antiangiogenic activity is attributable to a
change in TAM phenotype within the tumor, marked by the
expression of sVEGFR-1. Until now, most tumors (especially those
of the breast) show strong negative correlation between macrophage infiltration and outcome (6, 35, 36). In the current studies,
we reduced rates of breast cancer growth and metastasis despite
increasing the number of macrophages in the GM-CSF–treated
tumors. We conclude from these data that we have successfully
re-educated the TAMs within these tumors—manipulating their
behavior to affect desirable outcomes.
Macrophages in these areas also showed a phenotype switch
from M2 polarization, typically associated with TAMs to an
antitumor, M1 phenotype. Cytokines responsible for driving
macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, which is typically
associated with TAMs, were also greatly reduced by GM-CSF
treatment.
Neutralization of sVEGFR-1 with blocking antibodies shows
definitive evidence that this important antiangiogenic factor largely
mediates the effects of GM-CSF treatment on tumor growth.
However, sVEGFR-1 blockade did not completely reverse the effects
of GM-CSF treatment. Plausible explanations for this include (a)
that the blocking antibody had <100% activity or (b) that other
mechanisms can account for part of the GM-CSF effect. Others
have explored the use of autologous tumor cells engineered to
produce GM-CSF to treat human cancers, especially melanoma
(37). Their studies show that GM-CSF can stimulate the
differentiation and activity of dendritic cells, activating the
adaptive immune response to the tumor. These T-cell responses
could also occur in the present model. Such effects likely account
for at least a portion of the response not due to sVEGFR-1.
Taken together, our data show that GM-CSF reprogrammed
TAMs to slow tumor growth by starving the tumors of oxygen and
nutrients via increasing levels of sVEGFR-1 within the tumor,
preventing angiogenesis. Such models provide a powerful platform
for studying the involvement of macrophages and other cells in
the processes that comprise malignant transformation. Detailed
