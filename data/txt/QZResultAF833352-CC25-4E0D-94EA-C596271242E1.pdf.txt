BACKGROUND: Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have antitumor activity in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).
Resistance to these agents develops frequently, and their use is often limited by intolerance. Ramucirumab is a recombinant
human monoclonal antibody directed against human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. For this study, the authors
investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of ramucirumab in patients with TKI-resistant/intolerant mRCC. METHODS: In this
single-arm phase 2 trial, patients received ramucirumab 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks until they developed disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the best objective response rate (ORR); additional endpoints included the disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), the median duration of overall response, and safety. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients
with RCC received ramucirumab monotherapy. Prior TKI therapy included sunitinib (59% of patients), sunitinib and sorafenib
(30.8% of patients), and sorafenib (10.3% of patients). The ORR was 5.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6%-17.3%). The 12-week
DCR was 64.1% (95% CI, 47.2%-78.8%). The median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.1-9.7 months), and the median overall survival
was 24.8 months (95% CI, 18.9-32.6 months). Grade 3 or higher adverse events that occurred in 5% of patients included grade
3 hypertension (7.7%) and proteinuria (5.1%). There was 1 on-study death from multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS: Although the
study did not meet its primary endpoint of 15% ORR, ramucirumab was associated with evidence of antitumor activity in patients

INTRODUCTION
Recent biologic insights regarding clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have led to therapeutic advances, especially regarding frequent alterations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene/signaling pathway.1,2 The elucidation of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) up-regulation as a critical effect of VHL inactivation in RCC has led to the
development of VEGF pathway inhibitors for this disease. Despite the availability of multiple inhibitors of VEGF, VEGF
receptor (VEGFR), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in metastatic RCC (mRCC),3-8 complete responses
(CRs) are uncommon, and the duration of therapy is often limited by drug intolerance or disease progression. Among

Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B; LY3009806) is a
recombinant human monoclonal receptor-targeted antibody (MoAb) of the immunoglobulin G subclass 1 that
specifically binds to the extracellular domain of the
human VEGFR-2 with high affinity.9 Ramucirumab
blocks the interaction of VEGFR-2 and VEGF ligands
(including VEGF-A) and inhibits VEGF-stimulated endothelial proliferation and migration.10,11 In 2 phase 1
trials, ramucirumab was evaluated at doses and schedules
ranging from 2 mg/kg per week to 20 mg/kg every 3
weeks.9,12 Disease control in excess of 6 months was
observed in 30% of patients with diverse, resistant solid
malignancies9; dose-limiting toxicities were observed
infrequently and consisted of hypertension and deep vein
thrombosis.9
Preclinical models have indicated that antibodymediated VEGFR-2 inhibition confers disease control in
tumor xenografts resistant to VEGFR-2 inhibitory tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).13 IN the current, singlearm, phase 2 trial, we examined the efficacy and safety of
ramucirumab in patients who had mRCC with resistance
or intolerance to oral VEGFR TKIs. The primary
endpoint of the trial was the best objective response
rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included safety,
progression-free survival (PFS), the 12-week disease control rate (DCR) (CR 1 partial response [PR] 1 stable disease [SD]), and the median duration of overall response.
Exploratory objectives included serum-based analysis of
potentially relevant biomarkers and preliminary correlation of biomarker levels with efficacy.

of Helsinki. Patients provided written informed consent
before undergoing study procedures or receiving study
treatment.
Treatment and Dose Adjustments

The first dose of ramucirumab was administered within 7
days of enrollment. Patients received 8 mg/kg of ramucirumab infused intravenously over 1 hour on day 1 of each
14-day cycle. Treatment continued until patients developed PD or intolerable toxicity. A phase 2 dose of 8 mg/
kg every 2 weeks was selected, because this was associated
with minimum drug concentrations at which biologic activity was observed in preclinical models.15 In addition, in
phase 1 studies, antitumor activity was observed at or
below this dosage, and a pharmacokinetic evaluation indicated that doses at and above 8 mg/kg were associated
with pharmacokinetic profiles suggesting receptor
saturation.9,12
Dose modifications were permitted for nonlifethreatening, reversible grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs)
that resolved to grade 1 within 2 weeks and for unresolved, nonlife-threatening hypertension and proteinuria.
The infusion rate of ramucirumab was reduced for grade
1 and 2 infusion reactions. Ramucirumab was discontinued for grade 3 and 4 infusion reactions, arterial or venous
thromboembolic events, bleeding or hemorrhagic events;
grade 4 or poorly controlled hypertension; proteinuria
exceeding 3 g/24 hours; or persistent, recurrent proteinuria >2 g/24 hours.

Data and Statistical Analysis

This was a phase 2, single-arm, multicenter study (Clinical Trials.gov NCT 00515697). Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population and
included all enrolled patients who received ramucirumab.
The primary efficacy endpoint was best ORR using
RECIST v1.0 criteria.14 The planned sample size was 36
patients to detect an ORR 15% under a null hypothesis
that a response rate 3% would have no interest. This
sample size provided an 80% power to demonstrate the
assumed response rate at the 5% significance level. Secondary endpoints included safety, PFS, 12-week DCR
(CR 1 PR 1 SD), and median duration of overall
response. PFS was defined as the time from first therapy
until radiologic progressive disease or death from any
cause.
For exploratory analyses involving correlation of
biomarkers with efficacy (overall survival [OS], PFS, binary 12-week disease control [CR, PR, SD vs PD; patients
nonevaluable for tumor response were excluded], and best
percentage change in target lesion measurements), biomarkers were used as covariates in statistical models as follows: If at least 20% of the results were above or below the
limits of quantification, then the biomarkers were treated
as binary covariates dichotomized at the upper or lower
limit of quantification, respectively. Otherwise, they were
treated as: 1) continuous covariates, and, separately as 2)
continuous covariates treated as binary with automatic
cutoff point selection using an applicable maximal chisquare technique.17 Cox proportional hazard models,
logistic regression models, and linear regression models

were used for time-to-event, binary, and continuous efficacy outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Treatment

From November 2007 to February 2009, 40 patients
were enrolled. At completion of enrollment, several
patients were undergoing screening; these patients were
subsequently deemed eligible and requested participation.
The investigators and the study sponsor concurred that
their participation was appropriate. Overall, 39 patients
received investigational treatment and are included in the
primary efficacy analysis. Table 1 lists the baseline patient
characteristics. Fifty-nine percent of patients had received
prior sunitinib, 30.8% had received both prior sunitinib
and prior sorafenib, and 10.3% had received prior sorafenib. Eighty-five percent of patients discontinued TKIs
because of PD. Thirty-one percent of patients had
received 1 prior line of systemic therapy, and 69% had
received 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy (range,
1-5 prior lines of systemic therapy). The most frequent
sites of metastases were lung (79.5%), lymph nodes
(71.8%), and liver (30.8%). Overall, 47.5% of patients
were categorized with intermediate-risk disease according
to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center risk
group,18 as were 62.5% of patients according to the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium model.19
Efficacy

The observed ORR was 5.1% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.6%-17.3%; 1 CR and 1 PR). Twenty-five of 39
patients (64.1%) had SD. One patient achieved a CR
approximately 28 months after initial therapy; this patient
first achieved a PR approximately 4 months after starting
study therapy. A second patient achieved a PR after
approximately 5.5 months; the duration of response for
these patients was 27.6 months and 2.8 months, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates tumor burden reduction (at best
response assessment). The 12-week DCR was 64.1%
(95% CI, 47.2%-78.8%). At 12 weeks, 25 patients had
SD with no responses observed.
The median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.1-9.7
months), and 28% of patients were progression-free at 12
months (95% CI, 14.6%-43.1%) (Fig. 2). For patients
who had disease progression on prior TKI therapy, the
median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 4.1-10.3 months;)
and, for those who discontinued prior TKIs for other reasons, the median PFS was 9.7 months (95% CI, 1.3-13.2
months). The median PFS based on International

follows: poor, 2.6 months (95% CI, 1.2-6.2 months); intermediate, 4.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-8.5 months); and
favorable, 12.9 months (95% CI, 5.5 19.8 months). A
post-hoc analysis indicated that the median OS was 24.8
months (95% CI, 18.9-32.6 months).
Subgroup analyses were performed to examine
potential associations between hypertension and efficacy
(PFS or OS). For the 8 patients who experienced a
treatment-emergent AE of hypertension (any grade), the
median PFS was 15.9 months (95% CI, 1.6-19.8
months), and the median OS was 30.4 months (95% CI,
from 18.9 months to not applicable). For the 31 patients
who did not experience a treatment-emergent AE of
hypertension, the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI,
2.6-8.3 months), and the median OS was 24.3 months
(95% CI, 13.8-32.6 months).
Dose Modifications, Duration of Therapy, and
Safety

The median duration of therapy was 24 weeks (range, 2136 weeks), and the median number of infusions was 12
(range, 1-65 infusions). The median relative dose intensity was 98.6% (range, 76.2%-106.7%). Three patients
(7.7%) had a dose reduction, and 16 patients (41%)
required a dose delay. The duration of therapy on prior
sunitinib and/or sorafenib and on ramucirumab on-study,
was examined in a post-hoc analysis (Fig. 3). Twenty
patients received ramucirumab for more than 5 months
without PD, and 14 patients received ramucirumab for a
greater duration than they received the immediately preceding TKI. Thirty-three patients (84.6%) received subsequent systemic therapy, including mTOR inhibitors
(66.7%), bevacizumab (33.3%), and pazopanib (30.8%).
AEs that resulted in dose modifications/delays in >1
patient were proteinuria (n 5 3), acute renal failure
(n 5 2), hemoptysis (n 5 2), hypertension (n 5 2),
increased blood creatinine (n 5 2), and infusion reaction
(n 5 2). Overall, 37 patients (94.9%) experienced a drugrelated AE, defined as an event that was considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to investigational therapy. Of these, 10 patients (25.6%) experienced a grade 3
or 4 AE. The most common drug-related AEs were fatigue
(35.9%; 2.6% grade 3), headache (33.3%; 2.6% grade 3),
and epistaxis (30.8%; 0% grade 3). The incidence of
hypertension was 15.4% (7.7% grade 3) (Table 2).
Six patients (15.4%) experienced a drug-related serious AE (cardiorespiratory arrest, cerebral ischemia, myocardial infarction, proteinuria, hypertensive crisis, and

for multiple comparisons across markers, clinical endpoints, or analytic methodologies in these exploratory
analyses.
DISCUSSION
Management options for patients with mRCC who have
PD or intolerance to VEGFR-TKIs remain limited. Even
with the availability of 2 FDA-approved agents in this setting, the precise clinical utility of second-line mTOR or
VEGF pathway-directed therapy remains uncertain.
Here, we report the results from a single-arm, phase
2 trial examining the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab
in nephrectomized patients with clear cell mRCC who
predominantly had resistance to VEGFR-targeted TKIs.
Although the observed ORR did not meet the predefined
threshold for a successful result, the antitumor activity
was clinically meaningful, and the median PFS observed
in the study was comparable to that observed with other
agents in resistant settings,6,8 indicating that the ORR
may not have been the optimal endpoint for this trial. The
limitations of response as an endpoint in resistant cancer
settings are supported by data from the recently presented
phase 3 REGARD study (ramucirumab monotherapy for
previously treated advanced gastric or gastroesophageal
junction adenocarcinoma) indicating that, despite a modest response rate, treatment with second-line, single-agent
ramucirumab improved OS and PFS versus placebo in
patients with gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer.20
Our results strengthen the concept of sequential
VEGFR inhibition in mRCC.6,21-23 Patients who are able
to receive second-line and subsequent lines of therapy
have an inherently favorable prognosis relative to those
who are not candidates for further therapy beyond the first
line. It is likely that the disease control observed with
ramucirumab and the use of subsequent systemic therapies with documented efficacy in RCC (predominantly
mTOR inhibitors, bevacizumab, and pazopanib) contributed to the relatively favorable survival observed in this
group of substantially pretreated patients. Recent results
from the INTORSECT study (a phase 3 trial comparing
the efficacy and safety of temsirolimus with sorafenib in
patients with mRCC who failed prior therapy with sunitinib malate) indicated an improvement in OS with a
VEGFR inhibitor (sorafenib) after documented progression on sunitinib.23 Although comparisons across studies
are inherently limited, our study shares several features
with the RECORD-18 (RCC treatment with daily oral
everolimus) and AXIS6 (axitinib vs sorafenib in advanced
RCC) trials, which established the efficacy of everolimus
and axitinib in the second-line setting. Both of those
Cancer

June 1, 2014

randomized phase 3 trials had several limitations, including heterogeneity with respect to prior treatment and the
issue of drug intolerance versus PD. Our trial population
was similar, in that several patients’ enrollment was
because of drug intolerance to primary therapy and not
because of PD. Despite a limited understanding regarding
resistance to VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors, it is clear that
intolerance to an agent does not reflect the development
of biologic resistance in this disease.
Of particular interest is the AXIS trial,6 which compared the efficacy of axitinib versus sorafenib in patients
who had disease progression after front-line therapy. Both
agents led to modest RECIST-defined responses that
ranged from 9% to 19% in favor of axitinib. In addition,
there was a PFS improvement in favor of axitinib. Of interest was the observation that sorafenib in the second-line
setting outperformed its own efficacy from a previous
study.22 In AXIS, 54% of the population had received
prior sunitinib, and 35% had received cytokine-based
therapy without prior VEGFR-inhibitory TKI therapy.6
On the basis of a subset analysis of prior therapy versus independent review committee assessment, the efficacy of
axinitib (relative to sorafenib, especially as assessed by the
independent review committee) was observed predominantly in the cytokine-pretreated population as opposed
to patients who had received prior sunitinib.
In light of the modest PFS benefits conferred by
second-line therapy with available agents, tolerability and
safety become important. The AE profile of ramucirumab
is quite different from that of any mTOR-targeted or
VEGFR-targeted TKI. In our study, we observed AEs
similar to those reported with bevacizumab-based therapy; the most frequently observed drug-related AEs were
fatigue, headache, and epistaxis. The grade 3 incidence
of these AEs was generally less than 5%, with the exception of grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 proteinuria,
which were observed in 7.7% and 5.1% of patients,
respectively. The incidence of ATEs in the current study
was higher than that observed in other phase 1 and 2 studies investigating ramucirumab9,12,20 but was similar to
that reported by some studies involving the MoAb bevacizumab with chemotherapy.24,25 Of note, these events
occurred predominantly in patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors who had received ramucirumab
for more than 1 year. Ongoing randomized phase 3 trials
will more definitively delineate the incidence of ATEs in
patients receiving ramucirumab.
Exploratory biomarker analyses suggested that

week disease control. Similarly, higher baseline levels of
VEGF-A, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 had evidence of weak
associations with shorter PFS. Because of the single-arm
nature of this study, these findings are hypothesisgenerating, and no conclusions can be drawn regarding
their value as prognostic markers or as markers predictive
of ramucirumab efficacy. In addition, P values were not
adjusted for multiple comparisons in these exploratory
analyses.
Preliminary findings from our study suggest a
potential relation between hypertension and longer PFS,
as has been demonstrated with other VEGF inhibitors in
mRCC.26,27 However, analyses investigating an association between treatment-emergent hypertension on ramucirumab and the drug’s efficacy are exploratory, and their
interpretation is limited both by the lack of an appropriate
control, which could mean that any association is confounded by independent patient characteristics associated
with a better prognosis, and by the small sample size.
Additional study limitations include the single-arm, nonrandomized design; the use of ORR as the primary endpoint; and the use of RECIST criteria to define previous
failure on prior therapy.
In conclusion, ramucirumab had a limited impact in
the RECIST-defined response of patients with mRCC
who either had disease progression on or developed drug
intolerance to VEGFR inhibitors. The median and 1-year
PFS observed in the study are encouraging. Additional
investigation of ramucirumab in mRCC, either as monotherapy or in combination with agents that inhibit
mTOR, cMet,28 or immunomodulatory therapy, is under
consideration.
