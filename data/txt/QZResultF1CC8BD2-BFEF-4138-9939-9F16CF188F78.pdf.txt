Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy is one of the major side effects of the
anticancer drug cisplatin. Although previous work suggests
that this neuropathy correlates with formation of DNA
adducts in sensory neurons, growing evidence suggests that
cisplatin also increases the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which could cause DNA damage. Apurinic/
apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 (Ape1/Ref-1) is a
multifunctional protein involved in DNA base excision repair
of oxidative DNA damage and in redox regulation of a number
of transcription factors. Therefore, we asked whether altering
Ape1 functions would influence cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Sensory neurons in culture were exposed to cisplatin
for 24 hours and several end points of toxicity were measured,
including production of ROS, cell death, apoptosis, and
release of the immunoreactive calcitonin gene–related peptide
(iCGRP). Reducing expression of Ape1 in neuronal cultures
using small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhances cisplatininduced cell killing, apoptosis, ROS generation, and cisplatin-induced reduction in iCGRP release. Overexpressing
wild-type Ape1 attenuates all the toxic effects of cisplatin in
cells containing normal endogenous levels of Ape1 and in cells
with reduced Ape1 levels after Ape1siRNA treatment. Overexpressing the redox deficient/repair competent C65-Ape1
provides partial rescue, whereas the repair-deficient Ape1
(N226A + R177A) does not protect neurons from cisplatin
toxicity. We also observe an increase in phosphorylation of
p53 after a decrease in Ape1 levels in sensory neuronal
cultures. These results strongly support the notion that Ape1
is a potential translational target such that protecting Ape1
levels and particularly its DNA repair function could reduce
peripheral neuropathy in patients undergoing cisplatin
treatment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(15):6425–34]

Introduction
Cisplatin is one of the most commonly used cytotoxic agents in
the treatment of a variety of solid malignant tumors, including
testicular, bladder, lung, esophagus, stomach, and ovarian cancers,
as well as sarcomas and lymphomas (1). One of the major limitations of the use of cisplatin, however, is peripheral neuropathy
(2, 3) which seems to be caused mainly by the action of the drug on

dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (4). Cisplatin therapy and
cytotoxicity has been shown to involve the formation of intrastrand
and interstrand adducts in DNA (5), and this is thought to be one of
the major mechanisms for cisplatin-induced damage in sensory
neurons (3, 6). Indeed, mice deficient in nucleotide excision repair
(NER), the pathway once thought to be the major repair response
to cisplatin, show an increase in symptoms of neuropathy after
cisplatin treatment compared with mice with NER intact (7). However, there is growing evidence suggesting that cisplatin toxicity is
closely associated with increased generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS; refs. 8–10).
Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor (Ape1/Ref-1;
which will be called Ape1) is a ubiquitous multifunctional protein
involved in the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway of
oxidative DNA damage that can occur from either endogenous or
exogenous agents generating ROS (11–13). In addition, Ape1
functions as a major reducing-oxidizing (redox) factor augmenting
the binding activity of a number of transcription factors to DNA
including, but not limited to, nuclear factor-nB, p53, activator
protein 1, and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (13).
In neurons, these transcription factors play important roles in
neuronal survival, stress response, and various disorders (14–16).
Previous studies by our laboratory showed that Ape1 protects
sensory neuronal cells from oxidative DNA damage, secondary to
exposure to H2O2 (17). Other groups have shown that overexpression of Ape1 protected melanoma cells from cisplatin-induced
or H2O2-induced apoptosis (18), and we have shown that Ape1
overexpression protected germ cell tumor cells from radiation and
bleomycin treatment (19). Thus, there is precedent in mitotic
cancer cell lines that Ape1 plays a role in cisplatin-induced cell
death. The question remains, however, whether Ape1 could be
neuroprotective against cisplatin-induced toxicity in postmitotic
sensory neurons and thus have the potential to reduce peripheral
neuropathy. In this article, we show that cisplatin produces
significant amounts of ROS in sensory neuronal cultures and that
reducing Ape1 expression in these cultures results in an increase in
cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity and an increase in the activity of
the p53 signaling pathway. Conversely, overexpressing wild-type
(WT) and redox-deficient Ape1 in neuronal cultures attenuates
cisplatin-induced toxicity whereas a repair-deficient Ape1 does
not. These findings have potential translational applications such
that modifying or protecting the function of Ape1 in neuronal cells
may have chemoprotective effects for patients undergoing chemotherapy with platinating agents.

Materials and Methods

Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan) were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. DRGs
were collected from the spinal column, incubated in collagenase, and
mechanically dissociated. For studies measuring cell viability, ROS,
apoptosis, and signaling, f60,000 cells were plated into each well of
poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated six-well culture plates. For studies
measuring calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) release, f15,000 cells
were plated in 12-well culture plates. Cells were maintained in F-12 media
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 2 mmol/L glutamine,
100 Ag/mL normocin, 50 Ag/mL penicillin, 50 Ag/mL streptomycin,
50 Amol/L 5-fluoro-2¶-deoxyuridine (Invitrogen), 150 Amol/L uridine, and
30 ng/mL of nerve growth factor (Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc.) in
3% CO2 at 37jC.
Cell viability assays. To assay cell viability, trypan blue exclusion
analysis was performed as previously described (17). Cells were resuspended
using a 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution. Equal volumes of the cell suspension
and 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue in PBS were mixed, and the cells were scored
under phase contrast microscope.
ROS measurement. Sensory neuronal cell cultures were treated with
cisplatin for 24 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with
10 Amol/L carboxy-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen) in fresh PBS for 60 min (22).
Excessive probe was washed off with PBS, and cells were incubated in PBS
for another 60 min at 37jC. The cells were harvested with trypsin, and
fluorescence of the labeled cells was measured by using a Coulter EPICS
XL flow cytometer (Coulter). An average of 10,000 cells from each sample
was counted.
Ape1siRNA transfection. To decrease Ape1 in sensory neuronal cell
cultures, Ape1siRNA and SCsiApe1 (scrambled control) were used as
described previously (17, 23). Briefly, on the fourth day in culture, the
growth media was replaced with 0.5 mL of Optimem I medium containing
10 AL of the transfecting reagent Neuroporter in the absence or presence of
the 21-mer oligonucleotide double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA)
to Ape1 (Ape1siRNA) or scrambled Ape1siRNA (SCsiRNA). Fresh medium
(0.5 mL) without antibiotics was added after 24 h of incubation, and after
an additional 24 h, the medium was replaced with normal medium containing antibiotics and cell growth maintained.
Adenoviral infection. Adult sensory neuronal cell cultures were grown
for 8 d and then infected with either the WT Ad5 HA-Ape1 (WT-Ape1), the
redox deficient/DNA repair competent Ad5 HA-C65A (C65-Ape1), DNA
repair deficient/redox competent Ad5 HA-N226A+R177A (N226+R177Ape1), or vector control Ad5 IRES2EGFP (Vector) adenovirus at 150
plaque-forming unit per cell for 24 h by adding the virus directly to the
growth medium, as previously described (17). The N226A + R177A Ape1
double mutant has been shown to decrease the ability of this mutant Ape1
to bind to AP sites in DNA (24). The constructs used contained the human
Ape1 sequence so that the rat Ape1siRNA oligonucleotides could not bind
to it because of sequence differences between human and rat. However, the
codons are highly conserved, as well as their functions. The hemagglutinin
epitope (HA) tag was added to the amino terminus of Ape to distinguish
exogenous transgene overexpression from endogenous Ape1 gene levels and
has been routinely used by us (17). After 24 h, the medium containing
adenovirus was aspirated and replaced with culture medium. Infection
efficiencies of transduced cells were determined 24 h after infection by
fluorescence microscopy.
Cisplatin treatment. Adult sensory neuronal cultures were grown in
culture for 11 d, with or without siRNA transfection and with or without
adenovirus infection (vector, WT-Ape1, 226 + 177-Ape1, C65-Ape1), the
cells were washed, treated with cisplatin at various concentrations, and
analyzed as described in Results. Cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared
fresh for each experiment by dissolving in N,N-dimethylformamide
(Sigma-Aldrich) with the final N,N-dimethylformamide concentration of
<0.005%.
Western blot analysis. Cells in culture were harvested and lysed in an
ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.). Protein concentration was quantified using the detergent-compatible
(25), Lowry-based protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein (20–40 Ag)
was electrophoresed in SDS gel loading buffer on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene

difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was incubated with a primary
antibody against Ape1 (17, 26), phosphorylated histone H2AX (Ser139;
Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), phosphorylated p53 (Ser15; Cell Signaling
Technology), p53, Gadd45a (C-4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Generally,
antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:1,000 or 1:1,500. After incubation with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), Antibody binding was detected using chemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics Corp.), and equal loading was confirmed by
probing with h-actin monoclonal antibody (NeoMarkers, Inc.).
Cell apoptosis analysis. Apoptosis was quantitated using flow
cytometry after cell treatment using Annexin V–APC and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-ADD) and the Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit (BD
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apoptotic cells
were defined as those positive for Annexin V with or without 7-ADD
staining.
CGRP. Release studies were performed on the cells as previously
described (17). Briefly, the neuronal cultures were washed once with HEPES
buffer consisting of (in mmol/L) 25 HEPES, 135 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2,
1 MgCl2, 3.3 D-glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4), maintained
at 37jC, and then incubated for successive 10-min intervals with 0.4 mL of
the same buffer in the absence or presence of drugs. Basal or resting release
was determined by exposing the cells to HEPES buffer alone, whereas
stimulated release was determined by exposing the cultures to 30 nmol/L
capsaicin. Cells then were reexposed to HEPES buffer without drugs for one
or two 10-min incubations to reestablish resting release. During incubations, the cells were maintained in at 37jC. After each incubation, the buffer
was removed to measure the amount of CGRP using RIAs, as previously
described (17). At the end of each release experiment, the cells are scraped
and sonicated in 0.4 mol/L HCl and an aliquot was taken to measure total
CGRP content in the cultures using RIA. Total content is determined by
adding the total amount released in all incubations to the amount
remaining in the cells. The release data is calculated as a percentage of the
total peptide content in the cells. Because CGRP was measured by RIA,
results were expressed as CGRP-like immunoreactivity (iCGRP).
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as the mean F SE for at least
three independent experiments from separate harvests. Statistical analysis
was performed using ANOVA (*P < 0.05 versus control group).

Results
Effects of Cisplatin on Sensory Neuronal Cultures
Cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. In the first series of experiments, we determined the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on sensory
neuronal cultures by exposing cultures to various concentrations of
cisplatin for 24 hours and then measuring cell viability using the
trypan blue exclusion assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, exposing sensory
neurons to cisplatin causes a concentration-dependent decrease in
cell survival. Cisplatin (25 Amol/L) for 24 hours had no significant
effect on cell viability, whereas with 400 Amol/L cisplatin, only
4 F 0.01% of the cells survived. The calculated LD50 for cisplatin in
these experiments was 80 Amol/L.
Cisplatin-induced ROS generation. Although it is clear that
cisplatin results in DNA adducts in sensory neurons (6, 7), recent
evidence suggests that the drug also can produce ROS in
nonneuronal cells (27). To determine if cisplatin could produce
ROS in sensory neurons, cultures were exposed to increasing
concentrations of cisplatin for 24 hours and ROS was measured
using carboxy-H2DCFDA and fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis as described in Materials and Methods. In a
manner analogous to cell viability studies, 25 Amol/L cisplatin
was not effective, i.e., it did not increase ROS, whereas with
concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 Amol/L cisplatin, ROS was
significantly higher than untreated controls. As a positive control in
these experiments, cultures were exposed to 100 Amol/L tert-butyl

hydroperoxide (TBHP) for 1 hour (28), but the increase in ROS was
not as high as that observed with higher concentrations of
cisplatin. These data support our contention that ROS and
oxidative DNA damage are important components of the
deleterious effects of cisplatin on neuronal cells.
Cisplatin-induced increase in Ape1 expression. Several
studies have shown that ROS enhanced Ape1 expression in gastric
epithelial, ovary, macrophages, and liver cells (29, 30). The question
of whether chemotherapeutic agents, especially those typically
classified as DNA cross-linking agents alter Ape1 expression has
not been addressed. Therefore, we examined whether Ape1 expression in sensory neuronal cultures would be altered by exposing
cells to cisplatin. For these experiments, cultures were exposed to
various concentrations of cisplatin for 24 hours and Ape1 protein
expression was analyzed using immunoblotting. As shown in
Fig. 1C, Ape1 protein levels were not significantly increased when
cells were exposed to 6.25 or 12.5 Amol/L cisplatin, but were significantly higher than controls at 25 Amol/L and higher. Increased
Ape1 expression levels were also observed in cells 48 hours after
treatment with cisplatin (data not shown).

Reduced Expression of Ape1 Enhances CisplatinInduced Cytotoxicity and ROS Production in Sensory
Neuronal Cultures
Because cisplatin increased ROS and Ape1 expression in sensory
neurons, we examined whether reducing Ape1 expression in
sensory neuronal cultures would augment cisplatin-induced cell
death. Exposing neuronal cultures to Ape1siRNA significantly
reduced the expression of Ape1 compared with levels in cultures
exposed to SCsiRNA (see Fig. 2A for a representative Western blot).
This reduction of Ape1 resulted in a statistically significant increase
in cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity compared with the SCsiRNA
controls (Fig. 2B). The increase in cell killing was f20% greater
when Ape1 levels were decreased compared with cells treated with
SCsiRNA. This result shows that reduction of Ape1 expression in
sensory neuronal cells significantly increases cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity.
We also examined ROS production in cultures exposed to
SCsiRNA or Ape1siRNA. In these experiments, Ape1siRNA treatment reduced Ape1 expression by 70% compared with cultures
exposed to SCsiRNA (data not shown). This decrease in Ape1

expression resulted in a significant increase in the ROS generated
by a 24-hour exposure to 50 or 100 Amol/L cisplatin to 10% and
16% (Fig. 2C), respectively, compared with SCsiRNA-treated
cultures.
Cisplatin treatment (50 Amol/L) enhanced the level of Ape1
expression in cultures from 4 to 48 hours after a 24-hour exposure
in cultures treated with SCsiRNA (Fig. 2D) in a manner comparable
with that observed in previous experiments (Fig. 1A), but this did
not occur in cultures exposed to Ape1siRNA.

Ape1 Overexpression in Sensory Neuronal Cells in
Cultures Protects against Cisplatin-Induced
Cytotoxicity
Because reducing Ape1 expression in sensory neuronal cultures
augments cisplatin-induced toxicity, we determined whether overexpressing Ape1 could be neuroprotective. WT-Ape1, C65-Ape1,
or vector control adenoviral constructs containing an IRES site and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

an enhanced green fluorescent protein construct were used to
infect sensory neuronal cell cultures pretreated with either
SCsiRNA or Ape1siRNA. The cells were transfected with Ape1siRNA
on days 4 to 6 in culture, infected with WT-Ape1 or the C65-Ape1
adenovirus on day 8, and treated with cisplatin (50 Amol/L or
100 Amol/L) on day 11, and cell viability was assessed using trypan
blue after 24 hours of exposure to cisplatin. In all experiments, we
confirmed expression of the transgene proteins by performing
Western blots on cultures at the end of each experiment and using
HA antibody. As shown in representative Western blot in Fig. 3A,
after transfecting with Ape1siRNA, the expression of Ape1 was
lower than Ape1 levels in cultures treated with SCsiRNA. After
infection with viral vectors, however, the Ape1 expression was
higher (Fig. 3A). When cells treated with SCsiRNA and viral vector
control were exposed to cisplatin, there was a significant reduction
in cell survival (Fig. 3B, left). Cell viability was reduced from 95% in
cells not exposed to cisplatin to 65 F 5% and 51 F 3% after 50 and

100 Amol/L cisplatin, respectively. With a reduction in Ape1
expression, vector-treated cells showed an augmentation of
cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 3B, right) and these results
are analogous to the finding presented above. Overexpressing
either WT-Ape1 or C65-Ape1 significantly rescued cells from killing
by cisplatin. This occurred independent of whether the cells had
reduced Ape1 levels secondary to siRNA treatment. However, the
protective ability of C65-Ape1 was not equivalent to that of the
WT-Ape1. For example, in cells treated with Ape1siRNA, overexpressing WTApe1 increased cells viability after 100 Amol/L
cisplatin to 50 F 6%, whereas the C65-Ape only increased viability
to 32 F 3%.

Overexpression of Ape1 Reduces Cisplatin-Induced
Apoptosis in Sensory Neuronal Cultures
Apoptosis has been observed in sensory neurons after cisplatin
treatment in vitro and in vivo (31, 32). To ascertain whether Ape1
affects cisplatin-induced apoptosis in sensory neuronal cultures,
we performed apoptosis assays using Annexin V/propidium iodide
flow cytometry analysis. The time line for these experiments is

analogous to the previous studies, but after 24 hours of exposure to
100 Amol/L cisplatin GFP-positive cells were gated and cells
undergoing apoptosis were detected by Annexin and 7-ADD
staining. As shown in the representative experiment in Fig. 4A
and the summary data from six experiments in Fig. 4B, 22 F 4% of
cells from cultures exposed to SCsiRNA, viral vector, and cisplatin
were apoptotic. In cells treated with Ape1siRNA, vector, and
cisplatin, 46 F 6 were apoptotic. Overexpressing C65-Ape1 did not
significantly rescue the cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis,
whereas overexpressing WT-Ape1 significantly decreased the
number of apoptotic cells independent of whether the cells were
exposed to SCsiRNA or Ape1siRNA (Fig. 4). Although we do not see
a significant difference between the overexpression of C65-Ape1
compared with the vector control, there seem to be a trend in the
direction of the C65-Ape1 providing protection.

neurons in culture as an integrated functional output from these
cells. For these studies, sensory neuronal cultures in the absence or
presence of Ape1 manipulations were exposed to various concentrations of cisplatin for 24 hours, then release studies were
performed as outlined in Materials and Methods. For internal
consistency, the release studies were always performed on cells
grown in culture for 12 days. Exposing sensory neurons in culture
to various concentrations of cisplatin results in a concentrationdependent decrease in the capsaicin-evoked release of iCGRP
(Fig. 5A). Cisplatin (3 Amol/L) did not alter release compared with
untreated cells (11.3 F 0.3% of total iCGRP content for controls
versus 12.9 F 0.9% for treated cells). In contrast, both 10 and
30 Amol/L cisplatin reduced the capsaicin-evoked release to
6.3 F 0.2% and 3.5 F 0.1% of total content, respectively. Cisplatin
treatment had no significant effect on basal release of iCGRP from
sensory neurons. Basal release in untreated cells was 7.7 F 2.0
fmol/well/10 min and was 7.0 F 0.1, 7.4 F 2.0, and 7.1 F 0.2 fmol/
well/10 min after 3, 10, or 30 Amol/L cisplatin, respectively (data
not shown). For the remaining studies, we used a concentration

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

of 10 Amol/L cisplatin because it produces a significant decrease
in iCGRP release but does not cause cell death in the cultures
(see Fig. 1).
When neuronal cultures were exposed to SCsiRNA or Ape1siRNA
in the absence of cisplatin treatment, there was no significant
effect on capsaicin-evoked release compared with untreated
controls (Fig. 5B). When cells were exposed to SCsiRNA, which
did not reduce levels of Ape1, 10 Amol/L cisplatin for 24 hours
significantly reduced cisplatin-evoked release to 7.0 F 0.2% of total
iCGRP content, which is to the values observed in control cells
treated with 10 Amol/L cisplatin (Fig. 5A). Reducing Ape1
expression using siRNA, however, significantly augmented the
ability of cisplatin to reduce peptide release to 4.8 F 0.3% of total
content (Fig. 5B).
As in previous studies, we next determined if overexpression
of Ape1 or Ape1 mutants could reverse the effects of cisplatin
on iCGRP release. As in previous experiments, cultures were
first treated with siRNAs, infected with viral vectors, exposed to
10 Amol/L cisplatin for 24 hours, then basal and capsaicin-evoked

iCGRP release measures. When cells treated with SCsiRNA or
Ape1siRNA were infected with the vector control, cisplatin
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in capsaicin-evoked
release of iCGRP in a manner analogous to untreated cells (Fig. 5C).
In contrast, overexpression of WT-Ape1 or C65-Ape1 significantly
attenuated the effects of cisplatin (Fig. 5C). The addition of siRNA
and viral vectors in cells not exposed to cisplatin did not alter basal
or capsaicin evoked release of iCGRP (data not shown). In addition,
no treatment regimen significantly affected basal release.
These data suggest that the repair component of Ape1 is
involved in reversing the effects of cisplatin on peptide release from
sensory neurons. To further substantiate this notion, experiments
were performed using overexpression of another mutant Ape1,
N226A + R177A-Ape1 (24). This mutant has the redox component
of WT-Ape1, but no repair function (24). When this mutant was
overexpressed in sensory neuronal cultures, it had no effect on the
ability of cisplatin to reduce capsaicin-evoked release of iCGRP
(Fig. 5C).

Effect of Ape1 on DNA Damage and Expression of
Transcription Factors in Sensory Neuronal Cultures
Although the data above indicate that Ape1 is neuroprotective
against cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity, the question, what is the

mechanism of this protection, remains, thus to determine if
exposing sensory neurons to cisplatin would alter the phosphorylation of histone H2A.X as an indicator of double-strand breaks
(26) and transcription factors that are downstream of Ape1 that are
under redox control by Ape1, such as the transcription factor
p53 (33). Sensory neuronal cultures were treated with either
SCsiRNA or Ape1siRNA and followed by 50 umol/L cisplatin, and
the cells were harvested after 8, 24, and 48 hours exposure. When
cells treated with SCsiRNA were exposed to cisplatin, there was a
small increase in H2AX phosphorylation and phosphorylation
of p53 at the Ser15 position over time (Fig. 6A and B). Figure 6A
shows a representative Western blot, whereas Fig. 6B shows
summary results from three experiments. These increases were not
significantly different from cultures not exposed to cisplatin (time
zero). There also was no significant change in Gadd45a expression
as measured by Western blotting. In contrast, in cells treated with
Ape1siRNA, phosphorylation of H2AX was significantly higher after
48 hours of cisplatin exposure (Fig. 6A and B). Phosphorylation
of p53 was also significantly higher in cultures with reduced
Ape1 expression after 24 and 48 hours of cisplatin treatment.
Gadd45a protein was also greatly augmented at 24 hours in the
Ape1siRNA knockdown sensory neuronal cells compared with
SCsiRNA controls. This time course indicates an increase in the p53

reduction of Ape1 in cells.

Discussion
This report is the first data demonstrating a role of a BER
protein, Ape1, in sensory neuronal survival and function after
cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, we show that it is largely Ape1
repair function that is involved in the response of sensory neuronal
cells to cisplatin stress and that cisplatin causes an alteration of the
p53 signaling pathway. We chose to examine the effects of cisplatin
on sensory neurons because the neuropathy caused by this
anticancer drug is largely sensory and often involves paresthesia
and/or overt pain (34). Furthermore, platinum binding to DNA
in sensory neurons is high (3, 6) and exposing isolated sensory
neurons to cisplatin causes apoptosis (32). In this report, we observed a concentration-dependent increase in sensory neuronal cell
killing and apoptosis after cisplatin, confirming the previous
studies. Of interest, however, is the fact that a 10 Amol/L over
24 hours significantly reduced the release of iCGRP from sensory
neurons. We did not observe any significant change in the content
of iCGRP in the cultures after exposure to cisplatin (data not
shown); thus, the cisplatin-induced alterations in release were not
secondary to cell death or loss of transcription. Our observation of
a decrease in evoked release of iCGRP after cisplatin exposure, are
similar to in situ studies demonstrating that treating rats with
1.5 mg/kg cisplatin once per day for 5 days results in a decrease in
stimulated-release of the neuropeptides substance P, somatostatin,
and CGRP from the lower trachea and main bronchi (35). The
cisplatin-induced decrease in CGRP release from sensory neurons
suggests a loss of function of these neurons that could have
important consequences. The release of CGRP from peripheral
terminals of small diameter sensory neurons is associated with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

local vasodilation that contributes to neurogenic inflammation
(36). Indeed, CGRP is a potent vasodilator and a decrease in its
release could negatively affect local blood flow and contribute
to symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. At central terminals of
sensory neurons, CGRP may contribute to thermal sensation as
well as nociception. Thus, a decrease in its release in response to
stimuli could result in reduced sensory input. The potential effect
of a decrease in CGRP release on nociception still needs to be
determined. Cisplatin has been shown to induce ROS generation in
a selected number of cell systems (10, 37) and the increase in ROS
could damage lipids, proteins, and nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA), leading to cell death (38). Oxidative damage has been
suggested as the main cause of cisplatin-induced renal cell death
and several antioxidants and radical scavengers alleviate cisplatininduced nephrotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (39, 40). Recently, it
was shown that inhibiting mitochondrial respiration results in an
enhancement of cisplatin toxicity to leukemic cells (10) and an
imbalancing of the BER pathway in mitochondria using the OGG1
protein leads to enhanced cisplatin toxicity (10). In line with these
studies, our results show a significant increase in intracellular ROS
concentration in sensory neuronal cells follow cisplatin exposure
(Figs. 1 and 2). The basal increase in ROS production in sensory
neuronal cells parallels a significant increase in Ape1 expression;
the first time an induction of Ape1 has been seen after cisplatin
treatment. Furthermore, reducing Ape1 expression augments
cisplatin-induced ROS production. This correlates with previous
studies in tumor cell lines that showed cisplatin apoptosis is
mediated by ROS production and Ape1 overexpression can
suppress this ROS production (18, 41, 42).
The question remains as to the mechanisms by which cisplatin
induced toxicity in sensory neurons. Previous work shows a
correlation between the platinum binding to DNA and the toxicity
in sensory neurons (3, 6). This would imply that the nucleotide
excision repair pathway is important in regulating cisplatin-induced

toxicity and in mice deficient in NER function; there is an increase in
accumulation of unrepaired cross-links and in neurotoxicity (7). Our
current findings, however, show that Ape1 plays a role in reducing
cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. We show that reducing Ape1 by
siRNA increased cisplatin-induced ROS production (Fig. 2) and also
increased cell killing and apoptosis (Figs. 3 and 4) and deceased
iCGRP release (Fig. 5). Moreover, overexpression of Ape1 in DRG cells
or siRNA knockdown DRG cells resulted in increased protection
from cisplatin. Our current results further suggest that the repair
component of Ape1 plays a major role in its ability to protect against
cisplatin-induced toxicity. In most studies, both WT-Ape1 and the
C65-Ape1 repair competent/redox-deficient protein protected the
cells, although overexpression of the C65 mutant was effective at an
intermediate level. In contrast, the N226A + R177A-Ape1, which has
the redox component of WT-Ape1, but no repair function (24), was
not effective in blocking the ability of cisplatin to decrease iCGRP
release.
To begin to determine the mechanistic and signaling pathways
that may be involved in the response of DRG cells to cisplatininduced stress and the role of Ape1 in this process, we studied the
role of the p53 stress response pathway. We chose this pathway
to begin our analyses given the previously shown interactions
between Ape1 and p53 in tumor and normal, dividing cells (33, 43)
and because the p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a major role in
cellular response to DNA damage and other genomic aberrations,
particularly in mitotically growing cells. p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein and phosphorylation of Ser15, a key phosphorylation
target during the p53 activation process, has been shown as
being critical for p53-dependent transactivation (44). DNA damage
induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and leads to reduced
interaction between p53 and its negative regulator, oncoprotein
MDM2 (45, 46). To begin to examine this pathway, we performed
studies using Western blot analysis and found that altering Ape1
levels leads to alterations in the amount of phosphorylated p53 and
an increase in Gadd45a protein levels (Fig. 6). Our results indicate
an induction of p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 after the alteration
of Ape1 levels and cisplatin treatment, which is the first time a
relationship between Ape1 protein levels and p53 phosphorylation
has been observed. This change in p53 phosphorylation was correlated with an induction of Gadd45a and implicates this pathway
as the primary signaling pathway involving Ape1, cisplatin, and
ROS in DRG cells. Gadd45a, which is involved in the DNA repair,

maintenance of genomic stability, cell cycle control, and apoptosis,
and its induction is primarily p53 dependent (47). The p53GADD45a pathway is also intimately linked to the repair of DNA
damage related to cross-linking agents or those that are normally
repaired by the NER pathway (33, 48). Therefore, our findings
reported here are consistent with alterations in Ape1 levels and
functions impinging on DRG survival and function by altering both
BER and NER pathways.
While we present a number of novel findings in this report
(induction of Ape1 by cisplatin, knocking down Ape1 levels leading
to increased ROS in postmitotic cells, role of Ape1 redox and repair
functions in cisplatin survival, and function of sensory neurons and
the perturbation of the p53-Gadd45a signaling pathway by Ape1),
we have not completely delineated all the mechanisms that may
be acting with Ape1 perturbation in the DRG neuron. One of the
areas that will require additional study involves the role of the
mitochondria in these cells and in the DRG response to chemotherapeutic agents. For example, in a recent report, apoptosis
induced by cisplatin was shown to require the production of ROS,
but was independent of damage to nuclear DNA (49). Additionally,
mtDNA has been shown to be naturally more sensitive to oxidative
damage than nuclear DNA (50). Therefore, studying the effects of
cisplatin on the mitochondrial genome and role of Ape1 in the
repair of mtDNA damage after cisplatin treatment warrants further
investigation. It may turn out that the main response of DRG
neurons to cisplatin treatment is mediated through mitochondria
ROS production, such that altering Ape1 leads to a suboptimal
response of the mitochondria and a chain of events resulting in
DRG dysfunction or death.
