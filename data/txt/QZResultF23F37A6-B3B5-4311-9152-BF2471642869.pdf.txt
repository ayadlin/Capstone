Abstract
Although the p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors are known to play key
roles in cellular senescence in vitro, their roles in senescence remain rather poorly understood in vivo. This
situation is partly due to the possibility of compensatory effect(s) between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 or to the
upregulation of functionally related CDK inhibitors. To directly address the cooperative roles of p16INK4a and
p21Waf1/Cip1 in senescence in vivo, we generated a mouse line simply lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1
genes [double-knockout (DKO)]. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from DKO mice displayed no
evidence of cellular senescence when cultured serially in vitro. Moreover, DKO MEFs readily escaped Rasinduced senescence and overrode contact inhibition in culture. This was not the case in MEFs lacking either
p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1, indicating that p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 play cooperative roles in cellular senescence
and contact inhibition in vitro. Notably, we found the DKO mice to be extremely susceptible to 7,12-dimethylbenz
(a)anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate–induced skin carcinogenesis that involves oncogenic
mutation of the H-ras gene. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the high incidence of cancer in DKO
mice likely reflected a cooperative effect of increased benign skin tumor formation caused by p21Waf1/Cip1 loss,
with increased malignant conversion of benign skin tumors caused by p16INK4a loss. Our findings establish an
intrinsic cooperation between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in the onset of cellular senescence and tumor suppression in vivo. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9381–90. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) inhibitors are known to play key roles in the onset
of cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest
in culture (1–6). The simultaneous induction of p21Waf1/Cip1and
p16Ink4a expression cooperatively blocks the activation of both
cyclin D kinase (CDK4/6) and cyclin E kinase (CDK2), allowing
the accumulation of the dephosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) and thereby causing
permanent cell cycle arrest (7–10). It has become apparent

that cellular senescence can be induced by a variety of potentially oncogenic stimuli, such as telomere shortening,
DNA damage, oxidative stress, or oncogene expression
(11–14), suggesting that cellular senescence is likely to act as
a tumor suppression mechanism in vivo (15, 16). Although
the roles of p16Ink4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in cellular senescence
are well documented in various cell culture studies, the in vivo
roles of these CDK inhibitors are poorly understood (17). For
example, mice lacking p16INK4a (18, 19) or p21Waf1/Cip1 (20–22)
exhibit only a little predisposition to spontaneous tumor formation. These observations raise the question of whether the
results seen in cell culture studies truly reflect the physiologic
roles of these CDK inhibitors in vivo. However, it is also possible that these weak phenotypes could be due to functional
compensatory effect(s) between p16Ink4a and p21Waf1/Cip1.
To directly address the cooperative roles of p16INK4a and
p21Waf1/Cip1 in vivo, we generated a compound mouse line
simply lacking both of the p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 genes
[double-knockout (DKO) mouse] on a C57BL/6 background,
which is known to be carcinogenesis resistant (23–25), and
evaluated the roles of these two critical senescence inducers
in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, DKO mice are significantly
more susceptible to chemical carcinogenesis compared with
mice lacking either p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1 alone. Moreover,
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from DKO mice

into 6-cm-diameter dishes. Cells were maintained for 15 days
in a 3% O2/5% CO2 culture environment, and the medium
was changed twice a week until the cells were photographed
and counted.

Materials and Methods

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay
Senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay was done as
described previously (28).

Generation of p16−/−;p21−/− mice
p16−/− mice (C57BL/6) were kindly provided by N.E. Sharpless (University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive
Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC; ref. 19). p21−/− mice (C57BL/6)
were kindly provided by P. Leder (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA; ref. 20). p16−/−;p21−/− DKO mice were generated
by crossing p16−/− mice and p21−/− mice. All animals were
cared for by using protocols approved by the Committee for
the Use and Care of Experimental Animals of the Japanese
Foundation for Cancer Research.
Cell culture
MEFs were generated from E13.5 embryos of wild-type,
p16−/−, p21−/−, or p16−/−;p21−/− DKO mice as previously described (26). MEFs were grown in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum in 3% O2/5% CO2 for 2 days, harvested, viably frozen, and labeled as passage 0. Serial 3T3 cultivation was done as described (27). Cells were counted in
triplicate. The number of cells present on the third day
(N3) was divided by the initial cell number (N0 = 3 × 105)
and plotted as growth rate (N3/N0; Supplementary Fig. S1).
The increase in the population doubling level (ΔPDL) was
calculated according to the following formula: ΔPDL = log
(Nf/N0)/log 2, where N0 is the initial number of cells (3 × 105)
and Nf is the final number of cells.
Western blot analysis
Proteins (40 μg) were analyzed by Western blotting, as previously described (6). The primary antibodies used were
p16INK4a (11104 IBL), p21Waf1/Cip1 (sc-6246, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), p15INK4b (sc-613, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
p53 (1C12, Cell Signaling), p19Arf [ab80 (Abcam) or sc-32748
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology)], H-Ras (sc-29, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), pRb (554136, BD Pharmingen), β-actin
(AC-74, Sigma-Aldrich), and α-tublin (DM-1A, Sigma-Aldrich).
Secondary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).
Retrovirus infection and focus formation assay
Retroviral gene transfer was done by transient transfection
of the LinxE ecotropic packaging cells with a pBabe-puro
vector and the vector containing the human H-rasV12 oncogene, as previously described (6). Forty-eight hours after
transfection, the retrovirus-containing medium was collected, filtered, supplemented with 8 μg/mL polybrene (Sigma),
and used for multiple infection (twice a day for 2 days) into
early-passage MEFs (P0–P1) growing in 3% O 2 /5% CO 2 .
Infected cell populations were selected for 5 days in the
presence of 1 μg/mL puromycin. For foci formation assays,
1.7 × 104 puromycin-selected immortalized cells were seeded

Analysis of intracellular reactive oxygen species
To assess the generation of intracellular levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), cells were incubated with 20 μmol/L
2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Calbiochem) for 20 minutes at 37°C. The peak excitation wavelength for oxidized
2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein was 488 nm and the emission wavelength was 525 nm as described previously (6).
Chemically induced skin tumor formation
The chemically induced skin tumor formation analysis was
done as described previously (29). Briefly, mice of the wildtype, p16-KO, p21-KO, or DKO genotypes in the resting phase
of the hair cycle (8 weeks old) were shaved and treated with
100 μg of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) in 100 μL
of acetone. One week after DMBA treatment, mice were subsequently treated twice a week with 12.5 μg of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 100 μL of acetone for 20
weeks. Tumors developed in mice were analyzed for histology at 30 weeks after DMBA treatment.
Histologic analysis
Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, progressively
dehydrated through gradients of alcohol, and embedded in
paraffin. Samples were sectioned on a microtome at 4-μm
thickness, deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated, and then
stained with H&E for histologic analysis.

Results
p16INK4a;p21Waf1/Cip1 DKO MEFs proliferate without any
induction of cellular senescence by serial passaging
Compound mice lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 on a
C57BL/6 background (DKO mice) are fertile and born normally
in the expected Mendelian ratio. MEFs derived from wild-type
mice, p16INK4a knockout (p16-KO) mice, p21Waf1/Cip1 knockout
(p21-KO) mice, and DKO mice were subjected to serial
passage using the 3T3 protocol under standard culture conditions, which included atmospheric (20%) oxygen. Consistent
with previous reports, p16-KO MEFs underwent cellular senescence in a kinetic pattern similar to that of wild-type MEFs
(Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A and C; refs. 18, 19). The level
of p15INK4b expression was remarkably increased and the
p21Waf1/Cip1 level remained high in senescent p16-KO MEFs,
implying that a compensatory network among the CDK
inhibitors indeed exists as previously suggested (refs. 30–33;
Fig. 1C, lanes 1–4 and 10–13). p21-KO MEFs proliferated without detectable senescence growth arrest, although they exhibited a slight reduction in proliferation rate at passage 4, as
previously reported (ref. 26; Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A

culture. To compare the levels of proteins across the gels, the same sample (immortalized MEFs) was loaded on every gel (lanes 1, 10, 19, and 30). β-Actin
was used as a loading control. Representative data of two independent experiments are shown. Uncropped images are shown in Supplementary Data.

and C). Interestingly, MEFs lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1
(DKO MEFs) grew slightly but consistently better than p21-KO
MEFs, suggesting that p16INK4a also plays a role, at least to
some extent, in the cellular senescence provoked by the serial
passage of MEFs (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Because primary MEFs have been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress in culture (34), we next cul-

tured these MEFs with 3% oxygen, which is known to be
similar to the physiologic oxygen condition in vivo (34).
In contrast to the result with the 20% oxygen condition,
we were unable to see any significant difference in the cell
proliferation rate between wild-type MEFs and MEFs lacking the p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1 gene (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1B and D), although the DKO MEFs proliferated

slightly better than the MEFs of other types (Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Fig. S1B). As seen in the 20% oxygen condition, the level of p15INK4b expression, but not the expression of the other p16 INK4a family members (data not
shown), was substantially increased in both p16-KO MEFs
and DKO MEFs under the 3% oxygen condition (Fig. 1C,
lanes 1–18 and 30–40), suggesting that p15INK4b may play
a compensatory role in the absence of p16INK4a regardless
of the oxygen conditions in vitro, although this level of
p15INK4b expression does not seem to be high enough to
block cell proliferation (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Furthermore, because the p19Arf gene shares a locus with
p16INK4a and is also implicated in tumor suppression (35, 36), we
examined the level of p19Arf in these MEFs. However, we did
not see any substantial difference in p19Arf expression in MEFs
lacking the p16INK4a and/or p21Waf1/Cip1 gene compared with
wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1C).
DKO MEFs expressing oncogenic Ras escape contact
inhibition and form foci
Because cellular senescence can also be induced by activated ras oncogene expression, we next asked if the status
of the p16INK4a and/or p21Waf1/Cip1 gene affects Ras-induced
senescence under physiologic (3%) oxygen conditions. In
contrast to passage-induced senescence, MEFs of all the genotypes exhibited features of cellular senescence, including
cell cycle arrest, a flat and enlarged morphology, and the accumulation of the dephosphorylated form of pRb within 10 days
of infection with retrovirus encoding oncogenic Ras (Fig. 2).
Notably, increased expression of p15INK4b as well as p53 and
p19Arf upregulation was observed in Ras-induced senescence
(Fig. 2D). The depletion of p15INK4b by small interference RNA
abrogated the appearance of senescence markers in Rasinfected DKO MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S2). It is therefore
likely that the upregulation of p15INK4b expression plays an important role, at least partly, in oncogenic Ras–induced senescence in DKO MEFs. However, although the levels of
senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2B) and
the intracellular levels of ROS (Fig. 2C), which are markers
of cellular senescence, were increased in DKO MEFs, the level
of induction was less evident compared with the MEFs of
other genotypes. These results raise the possibility that
p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 are both required for the full induction of oncogenic Ras–induced senescence in culture.
Indeed, DKO MEFs expressing oncogenic Ras readily
escaped the senescent state and reinitiated proliferation
more rapidly than the MEFs of other genotypes under the
3% oxygen condition (Fig. 3A). Note that the saturation
density of the DKO MEFs expressing oncogenic Ras was
remarkably higher than that of the other cell types
(Fig. 3B). Interestingly, significant numbers of foci were also
observed in the confluent culture of the DKO MEFs expressing oncogenic Ras, but not the MEFs of other genotypes,
under the 3% oxygen condition (Fig. 3C). Taken together,
these results suggest that oncogenic Ras expression, in
conjunction with the loss of p16 INK4a and p21 Waf1/Cip1 ,
may have potential to counteract the pathway involved in
contact inhibition in cultured MEFs.

DKO mice are extremely susceptible to DMBA/TPA–
induced skin cancer
To explore the role of p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in oncogenic Ras expression in a more physiologic setting, wild-type,
p16-KO, p21-KO, and DKO mice were subjected to a conventional chemically induced skin carcinogenesis protocol, with
a single dose of DMBA followed by biweekly treatment of
TPA for 20 weeks. Because this protocol is known to cause
an oncogenic mutation in the endogenous H-ras gene, it
seemed to be an ideal system for studying the physiologic
response to oncogenic Ras expression in living animals
(37). In p16-KO mice, the frequency of benign skin papilloma
formation was not increased, and the maximum number of
papillomas was 6.8 per mouse on average, whereas 6.0 papillomas developed in wild-type mice (Fig. 4A and B). Interestingly, however, 23.08% of the p16-KO mice developed at least
one malignant skin tumor (Fig. 4B; Table 1), whereas 5.56% of
the wild-type mice developed skin cancer (Fig. 4A; Table 1) at
30 weeks after DMBA treatment. Note that a malignant tumor that appeared in the wild-type mice was carcinoma
in situ, whereas two thirds of the malignant tumors in the
p16-KO mice were more aggressive and invasive cancers
(Table 1). The malignant conversion ratio from benign papillomas in p16-KO mice was approximately five times higher
than that in wild-type mice (0.93% in wild-type mice versus
4.55% in p16-KO mice; see Table 1), indicating that p16INK4a
plays a role in preventing the malignant conversion of benign
skin tumors, but not benign skin tumor formation itself, at
least in this setting. This is consistent with the observation
that p16 INK4a expression is upregulated in the late stage
(30 weeks after DMBA treatment), but not in the early stage
(10 weeks after DMBA treatment), of DMBA/TPA–induced
skin papillomas (Supplementary Fig. S3; ref. 29). In addition,
the level of p19Arf expression was also increased in the late
papillomas (Supplementary Fig. S3), as seen in Ras-induced
senescence in cultured MEFs (Fig. 2D). These results suggest
that the upregulation of p19Arf, at least in part, contributes to
the induction of Ras-induced senescence in vitro and in vivo
in mice.
In stark contrast with p16-KO mice, the frequency of benign skin papilloma formation was strikingly increased in
p21-KO mice (the maximum number was 12.5 papillomas
per mouse; Fig. 4C). However, surprisingly, the malignant
conversion rate to advanced cancers was not increased in
these p21-KO mice (1.23%) at 30 weeks after DMBA treatment in this setting (Table 1). These results are consistent
with the previous observation by Weinberg and colleagues
(38), but not with the report by Topley and colleagues (39).
However, because each group used different protocols and
mouse strains, these seemingly contradictory data are, at
least partly, due to the differences in the experimental conditions between our study and the study of Topley and colleagues (39). Nevertheless, a substantial level of p21Waf1/Cip1
expression, but not p16INK4a expression, was induced in
the early stage of the benign skin papillomas (10 weeks
after DMBA treatment; Supplementary Fig. S3). These data
imply that a major role of p21Waf1/Cip1 is likely to be preventing benign skin papilloma formation rather than the

malignant conversion of benign skin tumors, at least in
this setting, although it is also possible that p21Waf1/Cip1
may have the ability to block progression to higher-grade
benign papillomas.
It is interesting that the frequencies of both the benign
papilloma formation (the maximum number was 16.0 papil-

lomas per mouse) and the incidence of cancer-bearing mice
were dramatically enhanced when DKO mice were subjected
to the DMBA/TPA–induced skin carcinogenesis protocol
(Fig. 4D; Table 1). By 30 weeks after the DMBA/TPA treatment, 84.21% of the DKO mice developed at least one carcinoma (Fig. 4D; Table 1). Notably, however, the malignant

Discussion

conversion rate of benign papillomas in DKO mice (5.92%)
was not increased compared with that in p16-KO mice
(4.55%; Table 1). These results indicate that the high incidence of cancer in the mice with the DKO genotype is likely
to be due to a cooperative effect of increased benign skin
papilloma formation due to p21Waf1/Cip1 loss and increased
malignant conversion of benign skin tumors due to p16INK4a
loss. It is also worth emphasizing that 31.6% (6 of 19) of the
DKO mice developed malignant spindle cell tumors, which
were more aggressively invasive through the muscle layers
compared with squamous cell carcinomas (Fig. 4D; Table 1).

In this study, we have generated for the first time the
p16INK4a;p21Waf1/Cip1 double mutant mice (DKO mice) on a
C57BL/6 background, a carcinogenesis-resistant strain, and
analyzed the effects of p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 deficiency
on the susceptibility to cancer in cooperation with oncogenic
Ras expression. MEFs derived from DKO mice easily escaped
Ras-induced senescence and overrode contact inhibition in
culture (Fig. 3). Moreover, DKO-mice on the C57BL/6 background were extremely susceptible to DMBA/TPA–induced
skin carcinogenesis (Fig. 4). Our analyses clearly show a significant increase of cancer incidence in the DKO background
because p21Waf1/Cip1 deletion promotes benign skin tumor
development and p16INK4a deletion promotes the incidence
of malignant conversion of benign skin tumors (Table 1).
There are reports showing that compound mice expressing
a mutant form of CDK4 (CDK4-R24C), which is resistant to
all of the p16INK4a family members, on a p21Waf1/Cip1-null
background are more susceptible to malignant tumors compared with mice either lacking p21Waf1/Cip1 or expressing
CDK4-R24C (27, 43). However, because CDK4-R24C has the
ability to counteract all of the p16INK4a family members, it
has been unclear whether p16INK4a or other p16INK4a family
members play a role in cooperating with p21Waf1/Cip1 in the
induction of cellular senescence and/or tumor suppression
in vivo. Our study has clarified that the increased tumor
incidence and immortalization of the previously described
cdk4r24c mutant mice and MEFs with the p21Waf1/Cip1-null
background are most likely to be due to the absence of
p16INK4a from among the INK4 family both in vitro and in vivo.
It is also noteworthy that 31.6% of the DKO mice developed
malignant spindle cell tumors, which were more aggressive

An intact DNA damage response prevents the
progression of DMBA/TPA–induced skin tumors
It was reported that oncogenic Ras induces DNA damage
signaling and the activation of the cell cycle checkpoint,
which are critical for the cellular senescence and tumor
suppression phenotypes (40–42). Therefore, we have examined γ-H2AX foci formation, a DNA damage response
marker, in tumors in all the genotypes. γ-H2AX foci were
detectable in a significant percentage of cells in the lowgrade papillomas in the wild-type, p21-KO, and p16-KO
mice. In contrast, a very small percentage of cells were
positive for γ-H2AX foci in the low-grade papillomas that
developed in DKO mice (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results suggest that p21Waf1/Cip1 and p16INK4a play important
roles in conducting the DNA damage signaling pathway.
Note that γ-H2AX foci were hardly detectable in most of
the high-grade papillomas and malignant tumors, such
as squamous cell carcinomas and spindle cell tumors, regardless of the genotype, suggesting that the higher-grade
papillomas and the malignant tumors seem to have a defect in responding to DNA damage signals.

Cooperative Role of p16 and p21 In vivo

than squamous cell carcinomas (Fig. 4D; Table 1). It is interesting that all of these spindle cell tumors exhibited a substantial increase in the expression of the Oct4 gene, which is known
to play an important role in stem cell maintenance and reprogramming (Supplementary Fig. S5), although the molecular
mechanism behind this upregulation remains unclear. This
is consistent in part with recent reports showing that both
the p16INK4a and p53-p21Waf1/Cip1 pathways play an inhibitory
role in the reprogramming of differentiated cells toward becoming induced pluripotent stem cells (44–49). It is therefore
tempting to speculate that the inactivation of both p16Ink4a
and p21Waf1/Cip1, in conjunction with Ras activation, increases
the chance of reprogramming differentiated cells or stimulates
the proliferation of undifferentiated cells in vivo. Further analysis is required to understand how the p16Ink4a and p21Waf1/Cip1
pathways are linked to Oct4 expression.
It is still possible that the phenotypic effects seen in
p16INK4a knockout mice and DKO mice are compromised,
at least to some extent, by developmental or somatic compensation by upregulation of the remaining p16INK4a family
members (30–33). Nonetheless, our results provide direct evidence that p16Ink4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 play cooperative roles in
the onset and/or the maintenance of Ras-induced senescence

in vitro and show for the first time that p16INK4a per se plays
a crucial role in preventing the malignant conversion of benign skin tumors in vivo.

Correction: Intrinsic Cooperation between
p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in the Onset of Cellular
Senescence and Tumor Suppression In vivo
In this article (Cancer Res 2010;70:9381–90), which was published in the November 15,
2010 issue of Cancer Research (1), an incorrect version of Figure 4A was published. The
correct version of the figure is provided below. The maximum number of papillomas
per mouse shown in Table 1 was calculated from this figure. Therefore, the conclusions of the data in the article are unaltered by this correction.
