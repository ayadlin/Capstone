ABSTRACT
Medicinal mushrooms in recent years have been the subject of many experiments
searching for anticancer properties. We previously screened thirteen mushrooms
for their potential in inhibiting tumor growth, and found that the water extract
of Amauroderma rude exerted the highest activity. Previous studies have shown
that the polysaccharides contained in the water extract were responsible for the
anticancer properties. This study was designed to explore the potential effects
of the polysaccharides on immune regulation and tumor growth. Using the crude
Amauroderma rude extract, in vitro experiments showed that the capacities of
spleen lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells were all increased.
In vivo experiments showed that the extract increased macrophage metabolism,
lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody production. In addition, the partially purified
product stimulated the secretion of cytokines in vitro, and in vivo. Overall, the extract
decreased tumor growth rates. Lastly, the active compound was purified and identified
as polysaccharide F212. Most importantly, the purified polysaccharide had the highest
activity in increasing lymphocyte proliferation. In summary, this molecule may serve
as a lead compound for drug development.

Krestin (PSK) and Polysaccharide Peptide (PSP), isolated
from Coriolus versicolor, have been subject to clinical
trials, and shown to have positive effects against cancer,
and they have been used in clinical settings for several
decades [14, 15]. Furthermore, the extraction and use
of polysaccharides from many other mushrooms such
as Ganoderma lucidum [16] Lentinula edodes [17],
Agaricus blazei [18], Antrodia camphorate [19], and
Grifola frondosaI [20] have also been shown to stimulate
immune activity. This caused us to look further into
another mushroom, Amauroderma rude.
Amauroderma rude (Berk.) Torrend belongs to the
Ganodermataceae family and distributes in the tropical and
subtropical zone [21]. We have previously demonstrated

INTRODUCTION
As a great source of polysaccharides, medicinal
mushrooms are commonly used herbs in oriental
countries for treatment of various diseases. A variety of
pharmaceutical properties of polysaccharides have been
revealed including antioxidant [1], anti-inflammatory
[2], antiallergic [3], antitumor [4–6], antidiabetes [7],
anticoagulant [8], antiviral [9], immunomodulatory
[10], antihepatopathy [11], and antifatigue [12]. The
polysaccharides contained in some mushrooms have
been shown to have immonopotentiating effects on many
cells in the immune system, including T cells, B cells,
and macrophages [13]. For example, Polysaccharide

that the water extract of Amauroderma rude can inhibit
cancer cell growth [6]. Since polysaccharides may be the
major components in the water extract, we hypothesized
that the polysaccharides of Amauroderma rude may have
immune regulatory activity. This study was designed
to explore the potential effects of the polysaccharides
isolated from Amauroderma rude on stimulating immune
activity and tumor growth inhibition.

and thymus was examined by evaluating the spleen
index and thymus index of five groups. We found that the
spleen index of mice treated with AR extract increased
significantly compared to the control group, while the
thymus index was not affected (Figure 3a).
We then examined the immunomodulatory activity
of AR in cellular immune function, humoral immunity,
and mononuclear macrophage function. The spleen
lymphocyte proliferated faster in all groups treated with
AR extract, although not to the levels of LPS treatment,
compared with the negative control group (Figure 3b).
The weight of earlaps increased significantly in the mice
treated with AR extract and LPS (Figure 3c).
Mononuclear macrophages were isolated from mice
injected with AR extract and LPS. Their function was
assessed using the carbon clearance test and engulfment
of fluorescent microspheres. We evaluated the phagocytic
index of AR groups and found significant increase with all
doses of AR extract in the carbon clearance test, compared
to the negative control group (Figure 3d). The fluorescent
microsphere index reached significant levels only when
the AR doses were relatively high (Figure 3d).
In the humoral immunity assay, we detected a
significant increase in the aggregation of antibodies
(Figure 3e, left), and the formation of hemolysis plaques
(Figure 3e, right), when the mice were treated with
AR extract or LPS. In the energy metabolism assay,
we detected significant increase in the proliferation of
macrophages isolated from mice injected with AR extract
(Figure 3f).
We tested the immunoreactivity of the partially
purified polysaccharides in vivo. After tumor cell
implantation, the mice were orally given the polysaccharide
fraction with the highest activity in lymphocyte proliferation
(Fraction F0.5, 2.4 mg/mouse). 7 h after delivery, we detected
significant increase in the secretion of IL-2 (Figure 4a, left)
and IFN-γ (Figure  4a, right) compared with the control.
These results were further confirmed by in vitro assays,
where the partially purified F0.5 Fraction was applied to
mouse spleen lymphocytes. 24 h after the addition of the
polysaccharides, we detected significant increase in the
secretion of IL-2 (Figure 4b) and TNF-α (Figure 4c) in a
dose-dependent manner, compared to the control.

RESULTS
Amauroderma rude extract increased the
immunomodulatory activity in vitro
We examined the possible immunomodulatory
activity of the crude polysaccharides from the
water extract of Amauroderma rude (AR). Mouse
lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen and their
proliferation was tested in the presence of the water
extract, along with endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides
(LPS), and Concanavalin A (ConA), since proliferation
of spleen lymphocytes is the prime indicant of
immunopotentiation [13]. We found that AR extract
was the most effective agent in stimulating proliferation
of the lymphocytes (Figure 1a and 1b). AR alone or
acting together with LPS/ConA significantly increased
lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner
compared with the control group.
We also isolated macrophages from mouse
peritoneal cavity and incubated them with AR, since
macrophages exert a variety of complex microbicidal
functions [22]. We found that incubation with
AR improved energy metabolism of macrophages
(Figure  1c) and increased macrophage engulfing of
neutral red (Figure 1d). Incubation of macrophages with
AR also increased production of nitric oxide in a dosedependent manner compared with the control group
(Figure 2a). Natural killer (NK) cells are important
effectors in innate immunity, but also play a role in
the regulation of the adaptive immune response [23].
We found that incubation with AR increased the function
of mouse natural killer cells significantly, by destroying
more cancer cells (Figure 2b). CD45 is a cell surface
glycoprotein that has been implicated in the integrinmediated adhesion of macrophages, and is reported
to affect the functional responsiveness of cells to
chemo-attractants [24]. We found that incubation with
AR increased the percentage of CD45 significantly,
compared with the control group (Figure 2c).

Amauroderma rude extract inhibited tumor
growth in mice
We then explored whether injection of the AR
extract affected tumor growth. After tumor implantation,
the mice were injected with AR extract and the tumor
growth rates were monitored every three days. We
detected a significant decrease in tumor growth rates
starting on day 20 in both groups, which were injected
with two doses of AR extract (Figure 5a, upper for tumor
growth rates, lower for a photo of typical tumor sizes).
When the animal experiment finished, the tumors were

extract induced extensive tumor cell death (Figure 5d). We
also examined the proliferative capacity of the tumor cells
using Ki67 positive cells. Injection of AR extract in the
tumor implanted mice significantly decreased Ki67 positive
cells, which suggested decreased proliferative activity
(Figure 5e). Furthermore, CD34 staining also displayed
decreased levels of positive cells in these mice (Figure 5e).

Amauroderma rude extracts were injected in areas far
away from the tumor implantation sites in the mice.
Therefore, this suggests that Amauroderma rude caused
the inhibitory effect on tumor growth by regulating the
immune system.
We tested the hypothesis that Amauroderma rude
could regulate the immune activity of the host by
stimulating the production of cytokines. It has been
reported that the polysaccharides can promote expression
of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interferon
gamma (IFNγ) [38]. TNFα is a cytokine involved in
systemic inflammation, which is expressed mainly by
activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and NK cells.
TNFα can promote an inflammatory response and
exert an acute immune response [39, 40]. IFNγ is a
dimerized cytokine that is critical for innate and adaptive
immunity against infections. It is an important activator
of macrophages and can be secreted by NK cells and
macrophages. Therefore it also has immunoregulatory
and antitumor properties [41–43]. Our results showed that
treatment with Amauroderma rude induced significant
production of TNFα and IFNγ. This may represent the
essential role of Amauroderma rude in the inhibition
of tumor growth. In clinical studies, cancer patients in
advanced stages were given polysaccharide fractions
of Ganoderma lucidum orally three times a day for
12 weeks. This treatment resulted in a significant increase
in the plasma concentrations of IL-2, IL-6, and IFNγ,
and a significant increase in the mean NK cell activity
compared to baseline [44]. Likewise, our in vitro and
in vivo experiments showed that Amauroderma rude also
stimulated the production of IL-2, TNF-α and IFNγ. IL-2
is a cytokine signaling molecule in the immune system
where it regulates the activities of white blood cells (e.g.
lymphocytes) that are responsible for the immunity [45].
Our results showed that the polysaccharides from
Amauroderma rude may function similarly to those from
Ganoderma lucidum, by producing these cytokines with
potent effects on immunity and anticancer.
To test the effect of polysaccharides on regulating
immune activity and inhibiting tumor growth, it is
essential to perform the experiments in normal mice that
have normal immune systems. In cancer research, most
of the tumor growth experiments are conducted in nude
mice using human cancer cell lines. Nude mice have
deficient immune systems to begin with, and are not ideal
animals to study drugs and herbal medicine which may
possess immune-regulatory activity. Thus, a tumor cell
line originally developed from the same strain of mice is
essential to be able to form tumors in those mice.
Although we found that the F212 polysaccharide
displayed immune regulatory activity, other molecules
in the pool may also possess activity in immune
regulation and antitumor growth. For example, when
we used the chromatography approach to purify the
bioactive ingredients, we could only use the fraction
with the highest immune regulatory activity for further

Resolution. Four fractions were obtained (Figure 6a,
F1, F2, F3, and F4). We identified that F1 possessed
the highest activity in functional tests. This fraction
was further purified by chromatography using column
Sephacryl™ S100 High Resolution. One typical peak of
polysaccharides was detected (Figure 7a, labeled 14.774).
After functional testing, we detected major activity in
the peak of F212. We identified the monosaccharide
compositions of F212 by contrasting monosaccharides
with reference substances and using the Total Ion
Chromatogram (TIC) (Figure 7b). Data analysis indicated
that F212 was made up of Ribose, Rhamnose, Arabinose,
Xylose, Mannose, Glucose, and Galactose, respectively
(Figure 7b, table inset). A larger view of the graph is
provided in Supplementary Figure S1. The molecular
weight of the purified polysaccharide was calculated (MN:
4.5852e3 g/mol, MW: 5.8659e3 g/mol).
Finally, we tested the role of the purified
polysaccharide F212 in cell proliferation. Incubation of
F212 with mouse cell line RAW264.7 increased their
proliferation (Figure 7c). However, at the concentrations
used, the AR extract and the partially purified
polysaccharides showed little effect on cell proliferation
compared to the control.

DISCUSSION
We previously reported that the water extract
of Amauroderma rude possessed the highest activity
among thirteen different medicinal mushrooms tested
in inducing cancer cell death [6]. It is believed that the
polysaccharides isolated from medicinal mushrooms are
the major components that possess anticancer activities
[25–27]. In this study, we precipitated the polysaccharides
from the water extract of Amauroderma rude using
a high concentration of ethanol. After a series of
chromatography purification, we obtained a single peak
(F212) and identified the monosaccharide components of
the polysaccharide.
Polysaccharides have been extensively isolated
from many medicinal mushrooms and their functions
have been studied showing anticancer properties [28–31].
The polysaccharide we purified represented the first
polysaccharide from Amauroderma rude, and it showed
to have strong functions in immunopotentiation in vitro
and in vivo. We found that the crude extract was able
to increase lymphocyte proliferation, increase natural
killer cell activity, and increase macrophage metabolism
and phagocytosis. Consistent with these effects, CD45
expression, production of NO, and production of
antibodies were also up-regulated. Our results were
consistent with another mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum,
whose isolated polysaccharides, small molecules, and
total extract showed many of the same anticancer effects
[32–37]. As a result of the strong immunoregulatory
activity, we detected a significant inhibitory effect of
Amauroderma rude on tumor growth. Moreover, the

purification. This relied on the total activity of each
fraction, rather than the activity of a single molecule.
It is possible that one fraction may contain some
molecules with very high immune regulatory activity,
but still not be selected because the fraction contained
fewer such molecules. Moreover, other fractions that
were not selected could contain novel molecules with
potent immune regulatory activity. This awaits further
investigation.
In general, it is known that large molecules with
complex structures possess strong capacities to induce
immune responses. For example, large polysaccharides
linking to a peptide, such as PSK and PSP purified
from Coriolus versicolor [14, 15], and some complex
polysaccharides purified from Ganoderma lucidum,
have been found to have a strong effect on immunity. An
unexpected result from our study was the identification
of a relatively small polysaccharide F212 that also
possessed strong immunity. The composition of F212
appeared similar to many polysaccharides purified from
other medicinal mushrooms. The structure of F212 awaits
future investigation.
In summary, we have purified and identified a
small polysaccharide with strong immunity from a newly
recognized medicinal mushroom, Amauroderma rude.
This represents the first known polysaccharide of this
species, which has strong anticancer activity [6]. It
appears that polysaccharides from Amauroderma rude
possess multiple effects on regulating the immune system
at the molecular and cellular level. This may explain the
strong immune function of the molecule. Understanding
the structure and function of this molecule may provide
helpful information in drug design.

Column fractionation was the process used to
purify the biologically active ingredient of AR. AR was
suspended with distilled water. In the meantime, 750 ml
DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow was packed into a column of
15 × 70 cm (d × h).
The AR suspension was applied to the top of
the Sepharose gel bed. After twenty min of careful
application of the sample, the column was eluted
with four bed volumes of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mol of
NaCl at an elution speed of 20 ml/min. Each collection
contained 1500 ml. Every collection was concentrated and
lyophilised producing fractions F0.1, F0.5, F1, and F2. The
immunomodulatory activity was screened by proliferation
of mouse spleen lymphocytes.

Proliferation and CD45 expression of mouse
lymphocytes from spleen
Male BALB/c mice (5-week old, 18 to 20 g) were
purchased from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal
Center (Foushan City, China). The license number was
SCXK2008-0002. The health certificate number was
44007200005061. The animals were provided with
water and mouse chow ad libitum, and were housed in a
rodent facility at 22 ± 1 ◦C with a 12 h light-dark cycle
for acclimatization. All procedures involving animals and
their care were approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute. Our
previous results proved the LD50/(mg/kg) of AR was above
and beyond 15000 mg/kg and AR was regarded as nontoxic.
The mice were sacrificed by dislocating cervical
vertebrae and marinated in 75% ethanol for three min. The
spleen was excised from the mice in sterile environment
and rinsed with serum-free RPMI-1640 medium twice,
then grinded and passed through a 100-mesh sieve. The
suspended lymphocytes were pelleted by centrifugation
(1000 rpm, 5 min), resuspended in Tris-NH4Cl and
pelleted by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min) to remove
red blood cells. This step was repeated once and the cells
were resuspended in serum-free RPMI-1640 to wash
one more time. After being pelleted by centrifugation
(1000 rpm, 5 min), the cells were resuspended in RPMI1640 medium and the number of cells were counted. The
cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were seeded on 96-well tissue
culture plates in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS. The
plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Drugs and samples
were added to the cultures at the concentrations indicated
in each figure. The cultures were subject to MTT assay
after incubating at 37°C for 44 h.
For measurement of CD45 production, the
lymphocytes were divided into five groups: control,

and AR-300 (5 μg/ml). Cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were

One group of mice was lumbar injected with 200 μl AR
(4 mg/ml), and the other group served as a control. 24 h
after the injection, proliferation of peritoneal macrophages
was measured by MTT assay as described earlier.
In phagocytic index assay, the function of the
macrophages was assessed via a carbon clearance test.
Each mouse was intravenously injected with diluted India
ink at 100 μl/10 g body weight. Blood specimens were
collected at 2 min (t1) and 10 min (t2) from the retinal
venous plexuses, and 20 μl blood was then mixed with
2 ml 0.1% Na2CO3. The absorbance at 600 nm was
measured on a UV-visible spectrophotometer with 0.1%
Na2CO3 as the blank. The liver and the spleen were
weighed, and the phagocytic index was calculated as
follows:
K= (lg OD1 − lg OD2)/(t2 − t1), where OD1 was for
t1 and OD2 was for t2.

Phagocytic index ˛ = "
κ × A/(B + C), where A is
the body weight, B is the liver weight, and C is the spleen
weight.

Effect of AR on macrophages in vivo

Male BALB/c mice (5-week old, 18 to 20 g) were
sacrificed by dislocating cervical vertebrae and marinated
in 75% ethanol for three min. Serum-free RPMI-1640
medium was injected into the peritoneal cavity and
withdrawn to collect the ascites. After centrifugation
(1000 rpm, 5 min), cells in the pellets were suspended in
RPMI-1640 and the number of cells were counted. Cells
(5 × 106 cells/ml) were seeded on 96-well tissue culture
plates in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS.
In energy metabolism assay, the plates were
incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Drugs and samples were added
to the cultures at the concentrations indicated in each
figure. The cultures were then incubated at 37°C for 20 h
followed by a MTT assay.
In the neutral red engulfment assay, cells in the
96-well plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After
centrifugation (1800 rpm, 5 min), 100 μl of neutral red
in physiological saline solution (0.1%) were added to
each well. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
After centrifugation (1800 rpm, 5 min), each well was
washed with 200 μl PBS twice, followed by addition of
100 μl cytolysate (acetic acid:anhydrous alcohol = 50:50).
The cells were incubated at room temperature overnight
followed by MTT assay.
To measure the nitric oxide concentrations, the
plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Drugs and samples
were added to the culture at the concentrations indicated in
each figure. The cultures were measured after incubating
at 37°C for 48 h by Griess assay.

Effect of AR on the immunoregulation in vivo
Female BALB/c mice (5 week old, 18 to 20 g)
were randomly divided into 4 groups (12 mice each). The
mice were given the crude polysaccharides orally (0.2 ml/
mouse, low dose, 19 mg/ml, medium dose, 38 mg/ml,
and high dose, 114 mg/ml) every two days for a total
of 30 days. The negative control group contained water
alone. The positive control group was lumbar injection
with LPS, every other day for five times totally (0.1 ml
for the first time and 0.2 ml each for the following 4 times,
0.05 mg/ml).
The mice were subject to visceral organ weight
measurements. 24 h after the last drug administration, the
animals were weighed and then sacrificed via decapitation.
The spleen and thymus were excised. The spleen, thymus,
and body weight of every group were measured. Organ
index (mg/g) = (weight of thymus or spleen)/body weight.
For lymphocyte proliferation assay, the spleens were
excised sterilely from the mice 24 h after the last drug
administration. Lymphocytes were prepared at a density
of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) were seeded
on 96-well tissue culture plates in RPMI-1640 containing
10% FBS. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h.
Drugs or the AR product were added to the cultures at

Assay using natural killer (NK) cells
In NK cell assay, the harvested mixture in the
lymphocytes was suspended in Tris-NH4Cl and centrifuged
(1000 rpm, 5 min), repeated twice. The pellets were then
suspended in serum-free RPMI-1640 and centrifuged
(1000 rpm, 5 min). The pellets were resuspended with
RPMI-1640 and the number of cells were counted. Cells
(5 × 106 cells/ml) were seeded on 96-well tissue culture
plates in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. The
plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Drugs and samples
were added to the cultures. The effect of the NK cells
was assayed after incubating at 37°C for 24 h as follows:
human breast cancer cells MT-1 (1 × 108 cells/ml) were
used as target cells and incubated with three groups of NK
cells: group I: 100 μl NK cells mixed with 100 μl MT-1

the concentrations indicated in the figure. The cultures
were then measured after incubating at 37°C for 72 h by
MTT assay.
For Delayed hypersensitivity (DH) (auricle swelling
model) assay, the abdomen was shaved and covered with
50 μl DNFB 24 h after the last drug administration. The
right ear was covered with 10 μl DNFB 5 days later. After
24 h, the mice were sacrificed by dislocating cervical
vertebrae and the earlaps were cut. The earlaps with a
diameter 8 mm were weighted.
For antibody production assay, the mice were
injected in the lumbar with 0.2 ml sheep erythrocyte
suspension (2%) 24 h after the last drug administration.
Five days later, the spleen was taken sterilely from the
mice and used to prepare a cell suspension (5 × 106�1 × 107
cells/ml). The activity of the antibody was tested in 6-well
plates, which were pre-coated with 0.5% agarose gel (1 ml/
well) dissolved in PBS. The spleen cell suspension (200 μl)
was mixed with sheep erythrocyte suspension (50 μl, 20%)
and 0.5 ml agarose gel (0.5% dissolved in Hank’s buffer
and pre-warmed to 46–50°C), followed by immediate
addition to the agarose gel-coated 6-well plates. The plates
were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by addition of
500 μl complement (1:10 dilutions). After incubation at
37°C for 2 h, hemolysis plaques were counted. Hemolysis
plaque = plaque/106 spleen cells.
For Delayed Type Hypersensitivity assay, the mice
were lumbar injected with 0.2 ml sheep erythrocyte
suspension (2%) 24 h after the last drug administration.
Five days later, serum was harvested by centrifugation.
The serum was doubling diluted and added into
Microhemagglutination Test Board (100 μl/well), followed
by addition of sheep erythrocyte suspension cells (0.5%,
100 μl/well). The board was incubated at 37°C for 3 h.
Antibody agglutination was examined and calculated as
follows: Aggregate = (S1+2S2+3S3……nSn), in which
1, 2, 3……n represented dilution factors and S means the
degree of agglutination.
To test engulfment of Fluorescent Microsphere,
the mice were lumbar injected with 0.2 ml suspension
of sheep erythrocyte (2%), 24 h after the last drug
administration. Ascites were harvested by injecting 3 ml
Hank’s (serum containing medium) into the peritoneal
cavity. Cell number was adjusted to 4–6 × 105cells/ml. The
cells (1 ml) were added to the 6-well tissue culture plates,
to which Fluorescent Microspheres (1 × 107 cells/plate)
had been added. The plates were incubated at 37°C for
2 h. The supernatant was removed and 0.3 ml PBS (4°C)
was added. The cells were suspended and separated from
the free Fluorescent Microspheres by passing through a
200-mesh sieve. Engulfment of Fluorescent Microspheres
by the cells was detected by flow cytometry. The Engulf
percentage (%) and Engulf index were calculated as
follows:
Phagocyticpercentage (%) = macrophage (Engulf
Fluorescent Microsphere)/macrophage(total)

Phagocytic index = Fluorescent Microsphere
engulfed/macrophage (total)

Effect of AR on tumor growth
Tumor growth assay was performed as described
[47, 48]. Briefly, female BALB/c mice (5 week old,
18  to 20 g) were randomly divided into 3 groups
(12 mice each). 4T1 cells (2 × 105 cells in 100 μl)
were injected into each mouse. The third day after cell
implantation, the mice were lumbar injected with drugs
or test samples (0.2 ml/mouse) every three days for a
total of ten injections. The test samples were either 2.4
mg/mouse (Group I), or 4.8 mg/mouse (Group II). The
negative control was serum-free RPMI-1640 medium.
Tumor growth was monitored twice per week. All of the
mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and tumors
were harvested on day 15. When the animal experiment
finished, the body weight and tumor weight was measured.
The partially purified polysaccharides (F0.5) were
also used to evaluate its effect on tumor growth in the
same approach. Tumor growth was monitored every
5 days. The body weight was measured at the beginning
and end of the experiment. The tumor sections were
examined by immunohistochemical staining and
expression of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ were examined
by ELISA test.

Statistical analysis
The results of all the experiments were subject to
statistical analysis by t-test. The levels of significance was
set at p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**) respectively.
