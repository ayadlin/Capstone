Abstract
Circadian timing of anticancer medications has improved treatment tolerability and efﬁcacy several fold, yet
with intersubject variability. Using three C57BL/6-based mouse strains of both sexes, we identiﬁed three
chronotoxicity classes with distinct circadian toxicity patterns of irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor active
against colorectal cancer. Liver and colon circadian 24-hour expression patterns of clock genes Rev-erba and
Bmal1 best discriminated these chronotoxicity classes, among 27 transcriptional 24-hour time series, according to
sparse linear discriminant analysis. An 8-hour phase advance was found both for Rev-erba and Bmal1 mRNA
expressions and for irinotecan chronotoxicity in clock-altered Per2m/m mice. The application of a maximum-aposteriori Bayesian inference method identiﬁed a linear model based on Rev-erba and Bmal1 circadian
expressions that accurately predicted for optimal irinotecan timing. The assessment of the Rev-erba and Bmal1
regulatory transcription loop in the molecular clock could critically improve the tolerability of chemotherapy
through a mathematical model–based determination of host-speciﬁc optimal timing. Cancer Res; 73(24); 7176–88.

Major Findings
The optimal circadian timing of an anticancer drug was
predicted despite its variation by up to 8-hour along the 24
hours among six mouse categories. This prediction relied
on a mathematical model using liver circadian expression
of clock genes Rev-erba and Bmal1 as input data and
treatment tolerability as output parameter.

Introduction
A signiﬁcant improvement in the safety of cancer therapies
could result from adequate drug timing within the 24 hours, as

shown in international randomized trials (1). Indeed a ﬁxed
circadian delivery schedule—so-called chronotherapy—
improved tolerability of 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin
up to 5-fold as compared with constant rate or differently
timed chronomodulated infusions of the same drugs over the
same infusion duration (2, 3). In experimental models, systemic
and organ-speciﬁc toxicities of forty anticancer medications
varied up to 10-fold according to circadian timing, supporting
the concept of chronotoxicity (1). Strikingly, the timing of best
drug tolerability coincided with that of best efﬁcacy (1, 4–6).
This puzzling ﬁnding was best explained both by the disruption
of circadian clocks and by cell-cycle variability in cancer cells
(7). Indeed the delivery of medications according to circadian
timing could shift the current cancer treatment paradigm from
"the worse the toxicity, the better the efﬁcacy" toward "the
better the tolerability, the better the efﬁcacy" (1, 6, 8). Chronotherapy effects resulted from the rhythmic control of drug
absorption, transport, metabolism, detoxiﬁcation, drug targets, cell cycle, and apoptosis by circadian clocks (1, 9–16).
Indeed, a molecular clock ticks within most body cells through
3 main interwoven transcriptional/posttranslational feedback
loops. These molecular clocks are coordinated by a central
pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei,
through diffusible and neurophysiologic signals (17, 18). Recent
extensive clinical data showed that male patients on a ﬁxed
chronotherapy schedule survived signiﬁcantly longer than
both female patients on the same schedule and male patients
on conventional delivery (19, 20). We assumed that the ﬁxed
chronotherapy schedule was optimal in male patients, as it was
developed on the basis of results from experiments in male
mice and humans (19). Thus, it so happened that most

Clock Genes Expression for Personalized Chemotherapy Timing

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Here, we present the mathematical model that was designed for predicting the circadian rhythm in drug toxicity, using body
weight loss (BWL) as main toxicity endpoint, based on circadian clock gene expression data. The inputs of this linear system model
are the circadian clock gene expressions data, whereas outputs are BWL data. The model matrix is trained to respond to each input
(gene expression data) with the corresponding output (BWL data) for a ﬁnite number of cases (training set). Then, another set of
data (validating set) is used for measuring model performance. For the training part, we adopt a Bayesian estimation approach that
is summarized as follows: considering the linear model gk ¼ Hf k þ "k , k ¼ 1, 2, . . ., K, where gk represents the output vector (BWL),
H is the model matrix, fk represents the input data (gene expression data, Reverb-a and Bmal1), "k represents modeling and
measurements errors, and K is the number of cases. We assign a normal distribution for the errors "k , which gives the possibility to
deﬁne the likelihood of all sets of data, and we also assign a normal distribution to the unknown elements of the matrix H to
translate our prior knowledge about it:

The proposed model is a simple linear one. The assigned prior laws are Gaussian (A). This simpliﬁes the expression of the
posterior law, which is also Gaussian (B), and both MAP and posterior mean (PM) estimators become the same, so that we have an
analytical expression for it (E). No other assumption was added to the model. An interesting extension would involve the use a prior
law that could enforce the sparsity of the elements of the model matrix. However, the limited numbers of training and validating
experimental data sets (4 and 2, respectively) call for caution regarding a broad generalization of model predictions.

scientiﬁc investigations have been usually conducted in male
experimental models and humans, besides reproductive tract
studies.
In the current study, a systems biology approach combined
in vivo and in silico studies to concurrently address the issue of
sex and genetic dependencies of optimal chemotherapy timing
using irinotecan as a model drug. This anticancer agent is a
topoisomerase I inhibitor with proven efﬁcacy against colorectal and other cancers. Yet it can produce severe neutropenia,
diarrhea, and fatigue, and compromise quality of life, and even
survival (21–23). Previous mouse studies showed that circadian
timing signiﬁcantly modiﬁed hematologic and/or intestinal
toxicities of irinotecan. However its optimal drug timing varied

www.aacrjournals.org

by up to 8 hours in mice under similar light/dark synchronization according to the different publication reports (24–26).
Here, we prospectively identiﬁed 3 distinct chronotoxicity
classes according to sex and genetic background, despite the
same photoperiodic synchronization, using both pharmacologic and molecular endpoints. We conﬁrmed the role of
molecular clock function for irinotecan chronotoxicity in mice
with clock gene Per2 mutation. The data helped us design a
mathematical model that accurately predicted for optimal
irinotecan timing according to both clock gene circadian
expressions and recapitulated sex and genetic differences. We
discuss the implications of this new concept for improving
treatment outcomes through personalized chronotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Animals and synchronization
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
French guidelines for animal care and experimentation
(Decree 87-843). The studies were carried out in male and
female mice of C57BL/6J, B6D2F1 (female C57BL/6 x male
DBA2) and B6CBAF1 (female C57BL/6 x male CBA), 7 weeks of
age, were purchased from Janvier. Mice were synchronized
with an alternation of 12 hours of light (L) and 12 hours of
darkness (D) (LD 12:12), with food and water ad libitum for 3
weeks before any intervention. Zeitgeber Time 0 (ZT0) and
ZT12 corresponded to L onset and D onset, respectively. All
manipulations during the dark span were conducted under
dim red light (<7 lux).
Drug
Hydrochloride irinotecan powder was purchased from Chemos Gmbh and diluted in sterile water every 2 days on each
study day, before injections. The ﬁnal drug solution was
injected intravenously into the retro-orbital venous sinus of
the mice (10 mL/kg of body weight).
Experimental designs
For the systemic chronotoxicity experiments, irinotecan was
administered daily at ZT3, ZT7, ZT11, ZT15, ZT19, or ZT23 for 4
consecutive days. Overall 720 mice received a daily dose level of
50 mg/kg for C57BL/6J and B6D2F1 or 80 mg/kg for B6CBAF1,
according to previous equitoxicity data (27). For the target
organ chronotoxicity experiments, mice in each potential
chronotoxicity class (total N ¼ 198) received daily irinotecan
(50 mg/kg/d) for 4 consecutive days at the ZT corresponding to
their respective best and worst tolerability, that is, ZT15 and
ZT3 for class 1, ZT11 and ZT23 for class 2, and ZT15 and ZT7 for
class 3. Blood cell counts and bone marrow and intestinal
damage were assessed 2, 4, and 6 days after irinotecan treatment completion.
For the pharmacokinetic experiment, mice in each class
(total N ¼ 240) received a single irinotecan dose (50 mg/kg) at
the ZT corresponding to its respective best and worst tolerability. Iterative blood sampling was conducted in separate
groups of mice, from 1 minute to 12 hours postdose, according
to a transverse design.
For the molecular characterization of the 3 chronotoxicity
classes, we determined the mRNA expressions of selected
genes in liver and/or in colon mucosa using a total of 72 mice
from 3 chronotoxicity classes through tissue sampling at ZT0,
ZT3, ZT6, ZT9, ZT12, ZT15, ZT18, or ZT21. We studied clock
genes Rev-erba, Per2, and Bmal1 and clock-controlled genes
involved in irinotecan metabolism—CES2, Top1, UGT1A1, and
DBP; cell cycle—Wee1, Ccna2, Ccnb2, and p21; and apoptosis—
Bcl2, Mdm2, Bax, and p53.
The 24-hour patterns in Rev-erba and Bmal1 mRNA expression were documented in the liver of male wild type (WT) and
male and female Per2m/m (129SvEvBrd  C57BL/6-Tyrc-Brd
background). Five mice were studied in each group at each
of 6 time points staggered by 4 hours (ZT3, 7, 11, 15, 19, or 23).
To probe the critical role of the molecular clock for irinotecan

chronotoxicity, we used mice with Per2m/m (Per2brdm1 on
129SvEvBrd  C57BL/6-Tyrc-Brd background and 7 backcross
generation in C57BL/6J) in 2 consecutive experiments. This
clock-defective model reportedly displayed gradual suppression of the circadian activity rhythm in constant darkness (28),
altered corticosterone rhythm, and deregulated cell cycle (29).
Irinotecan (50 mg/kg/d  4 days) was ﬁrst injected at 1 of 6 ZT
in 41 male and 30 female Per2m/m mice, with body weight
change being the primary endpoint. To probe the effect of
molecular clock disruption on irinotecan target organ toxicities, we administered irinotecan (50 mg/kg/d  4 days at ZT7)
to 16 male Per2m/m or wide type WT mice and obtained blood,
femoral bone marrow, and ileum and colon mucosae 48 hours
after treatment completion. The circadian molecular clocks
were investigated in male corresponding WT and Per2m/m of
both sexes (129SvEvBrd  C57BL/6-Tyrc-Brd background).
Hematologic toxicity
Blood and 2 femurs were sampled from each mouse. Bone
marrow cells were collected by repeatedly ﬂushing the femurs
with PBS through a 26-gauge needle. Circulating leukocytes
and lymphocytes and bone marrow nucleated cells were
counted with Cell-Dyn 3500R (Abbott Diagnostic).
Histopathology
The ileum and colon were obtained following treatment at 2
ZT's, respectively, corresponding to "best" or "worst" tolerability of each class, or at optimal ZT for Per2m/m mice and ﬁxed
into 4% paraformaldehyde. Twenty-four hours later, the samples were dehydrated and embedded into parafﬁn. Sections
were stained with hemalun/erythrosine/safran. Each slide was
examined by the same histopathologist, and lesions were
graded in a blind manner. Ileum and colon lesions were scored
as 1 for each of the following items: surface epithelial cells, villi
structure, and crypt gland cells. The sum of all 3 scores was
computed as being a toxicity grade, ranging from 0 (normal) to
3 (alteration for each item). Apoptotic cells per 10 crypts were
counted in ileum mucosa by a senior pathologist.
Plasma irinotecan and SN-38 pharmacokinetic
Blood was collected at 1, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, and 720
minutes after irinotecan injection. Plasma was obtained by
centrifugation at 850  g for 10 minutes at 4 C and then kept at
80 C until analyses.
Plasma concentrations of irinotecan and SN-38 were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC;
ref. 30). Plasma concentrations versus time data were analyzed
by noncomparmental methods. Kinetica program was used to
calculate area under the concentration curve (AUC), maximum
concentration (Cmax), clearance, volume of distribution (Vd),
and elimination t1/2 values. AUC for 0 to 12 hours (AUC0–12h)
was calculated by using plasma concentration–time curves of
irinotecan and SN-38. The AUC calculations were based on
the linear trapezoidal rule. Plasma concentration of irinotecan
and SN-38 determined in ﬁrst minute was accepted as Cmax
parameter. The metabolic ratio was computed as AUC0–12 of
SN-38/AUC0–12 of irinotecan.

Clock Genes Expression for Personalized Chemotherapy Timing

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Colon was sectioned and the colon lumen was washed with
PBS and then cut open longitudinally. Colon mucosa was
harvested by lightly scraping the surface, then suspended in
PBS, and stored at 80 C until RNA extraction.
Total RNA from liver and colon mucosa were puriﬁed (31)
and stored at 80 C until use. Total RNA was converted to
cDNA using random primers and Superscript II (Invitrogen).
Quantitative PCR was carried out with a Light Cycler 480
(Roche Diagnostics) using SYBR Green I dye detection. Expression levels were normalized to the levels of the constitutively
and nonrhythmically expressed housekeeping gene 36B4, as
previously described (32). All primers were obtained from
Invitrogen Life Technologies.
Statistical analyses
Means and SEM were calculated and plotted for each set of
parameters. Intergroup differences were statistically validated
by multiple-way ANOVA with Scheffe post hoc tests.
Rhythm parameters were computed for each group by using
standard population Cosinor procedures. Cosinor analysis
provided mesor (rhythm-adjusted mean), double amplitude
(difference between minimum and maximum of ﬁtted cosine
function), and acrophase (time of maximum in best-ﬁtting
cosine function, with light onset as phase reference), with their
respective 95% conﬁdence limits when P < 0.05. Cosinorcomputed parameters were compared using the Hotelling t
test. All statistical analyses were conducted with dedicated
tools developed under SPSS.
Signal and systems analyses
Factor analysis and principal component analysis (PCA)
were used to identify the number of factors or principal
components best needed to describe the 27 gene expression
time series, using FACTORAN and PCA programs for
MATLAB. Modiﬁed sparse PCA was then used to minimize
the number of non-zero elements and select relevant variables in the loading matrix (33). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied to identify those factors that best
discriminated the 3 chronotoxicity classes. This process was
complemented by the use of sparse LDA, which jointly
searched for the most discriminating and the sparsest
loading matrix (34, 35).
The degree of dependencies between 2 variables was robustly measured using Spearman correlation coefﬁcient, without
any assumption of a Gaussian distribution (Spearman correlation coefﬁcients were computed between the circadian
expressions waveforms). The adjacency tables between the
variables and their respective graphical displays were constructed for each organ in each chronotoxicity class.
Mathematical modeling for predicting irinotecan
chronotoxicity pattern and optimal timing
The time series of 2 clock gene expressions were used for
predicting the chronotoxicity pattern (BWL). The relation
between the input data (here, Rev-erba and Bmal1) and the
output data (BWL) was assumed to be linear (Supplementary
Fig. S1).

www.aacrjournals.org

The mathematical equations relating the inputs and the
outputs for different classes were written as
g k ¼ Hf k þ "k ; k ¼ 1; . . . ; K
where fk represented the input vectors, gk represented the
output vectors, H was the model matrix, and K was the number
of classes. The MAP criterion used was equivalent to the
minimization of the following criterion:

The data representing the input had been sampled every 3
hours, from ZT0 to ZT21, in the non-mutant case, and every 4
hours, from ZT3 to ZT21 in the mutant case. Therefore, the Reverba data and Bmal1 data were represented as vectors having
the length 8 (an extrapolation is used for the mutant case), so
the input vector had the length 16. The data representing the
output were sampled every 4 hours, from ZT3 to ZT23, so the
BWL data, was represented as a vector having the length 6.
Both input and output data represented the mean values of the
measured data at every point. The matrix H thus had the
dimension 6  16.
The method was implemented on mean data. The matrix
was built using 3 pairs of data representing the non-mutant
case and 1 pair of data representing the mutant case (training).
For checking the accuracy of prediction, one pair of data
representing the non-mutant case and one pair of data representing the mutant case were used (testing).

Results
Chronotoxicity classes
The dosing time dependency of irinotecan tolerability was
ﬁrst investigated in mice according to sex and genetic background, so as to possibly deﬁne distinct chronotoxicity classes.
Mice on irinotecan lost weight, with a nadir occurring 1 to 3
days after the fourth daily dose and fully recovered pretreatment weight within 1 to 7 days. Maximum BWL varied as a
function of circadian timing, sex and strain (ANOVA, P < 0.001
for each factor; Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C).
Overall, irinotecan was best tolerated in female rather than
male mice (P < 0.001). Tolerability was best in B6CBAF1 rather
than C57BL/6 or B6D2F1 (P < 0.001). BWL was most prominent
in mice treated at ZT23, that is, near the end of the nocturnal
activity span, or at ZT3 or at ZT7 pending upon sex and strain
(P < 0.001). The relative circadian improvement in irinotecan
tolerability ranged from 4.2- to 8.4-fold in female mice and from
1.9- to 3.6-fold in male mice, according to genetic background.

4 days to C57BL/6 or B6D2F1 (50 mg/kg/d) or B6CBAF1 (80 mg/kg/d) at 1 of 6 ZT. Top row, histograms of mean body weight change  SEM according to
irinotecan timing (n ¼ 15–45 per ZT for each sex and hybrid background) in B6D2F1 (A) and B6CBAF1 (B). Bottom row, identiﬁcation of 3 chronotoxicity classes
based on the reconstructed circadian patterns with statistically validated 24-hour  12-hour rhythmic components according to Cosinor analysis class 1,

triangle symbol, mean ( SEM) according to ZT for the respective representatives of each class (class 1, female B6D2F1; class 2, male B6D2F1; class 3, female
B6CBA1). Horizontal axis, white and black rectangles indicate light and dark spans of photoperiodic cycle, respectively. Statistically signiﬁcant differences as
a function of ZT, sex, and strain (P from 2-way ANOVA, <0.001). Modeled circadian maximum and minimum BWL at ZT3 and ZT15 for class 1, at ZT23
and ZT11 for class 2, and at ZT7 and ZT15 for class 3, respectively. See Supplementary Table S1 for results from Cosinor analyses.

Chronotoxicity patterns were similar in C57BL/6 and B6D2F1
mice of the same sex, but they differed in B6CBAF1. Sex-related
differences were most obvious in B6D2F1 (Supplementary Fig.
S2A and S2B and Supplementary Table S1).
The accuracy of optimal irinotecan timing was further
determined among ZT7, ZT11, or ZT15 through adequately
powered additional experiments in male and female B6D2F1
and B6CBAF1 mice. The optimal dosing time of irinotecan was
conﬁrmed to be ZT11 in male B6D2F1 (ANOVA, P ¼ 0.034; post
hoc Scheffe test, ZT7 < ZT11, P ¼ 0.041; Supplementary Fig.
S2D). In contrast, treatment at ZT15 achieved best tolerability
in female B6D2F1 mice (P < 0.001) and in male and female
B6CBAF1 (P ¼ 0.01 and 0.04, respectively; Supplementary Fig.
S2D and S2E).
The circadian waveform of the toxicity pattern displayed a
unimodal 24-hour pattern, with a single fundamental period of
24 hours, both in male and female B6D2F1 (P < 0.00001) and
C57BL/6 (P < 0.001), without any signiﬁcant 12-hour harmonic
component (Supplementary Table S1). Conversely, both 24and 12-hour periodic components were validated in male and
female B6CBAF1. Distinct 24-hour patterns characterized the
reconstructed circadian signals as a function of sex and genetic
background (Fig. 1C–E).

Cancer Res; 73(24) December 15, 2013

These results supported the identiﬁcation of 3 chronotoxicity classes and their underlined representatives for subsequent studies to be conducted: female B6D2F1 and C57BL/6 as
class 1, male B6D2F1 and C57BL/6 as class 2, and male and
female B6CBAF1 as class 3. These representatives displayed
statistically validated differences regarding chronotoxicity
mesor, amplitude, timing, and reconstructed waveform (Fig.
1C–E; Supplementary Table S1).
In addition, the extents of both hematologic and intestinal
toxicities also depended upon irinotecan timing, in good
agreement with body weight change data (Fig. 2A–D). However, no consistent relation-linked drug toxicities and irinotecan or SN-38 plasma pharmacokinetics. The expected positive
relation between chronotoxicity and plasma exposure to irinotecan and SN-38 was found for class 1, but not for classes 2 or
3 (Fig. 2E and F; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These
ﬁndings called for investigations of molecular clock and clockcontrolled pathways in liver, where irinotecan was bioactivated
and detoxiﬁed, and in colon, an important toxicity target.

the least toxic time, with SN-38 AUC (mean  SEM, mg min/mL) ranging from 329  85 in class 2 to 498  154 in class 1, and 630  64 in class 3. All

colon (by 65- to 118-fold). Per2 expression varied 13- to 17-fold in
liver and 7.5- to 15-fold in colon, whereas Bmal1 ranges 19- to 109fold in liver and 10- to 15-fold in colon according to class. Cosinor
analysis documented sinusoidal circadian rhythms for the
expression of all 3 genes, with acrophases occurring near midlight for Rev-erba, near mid-dark for Per2, and near the end of the
dark span for Bmal1. The expression of Rev-erba during the light
span and that Bmal1 at night mostly differentiated the 3 classes.
The circadian peak of clock-controlled gene Wee1 in liver
occurred at ZT9 in classes 1 and 3, as compared with ZT15 in
class 2 (Fig. 3). In colon, Wee1 peaked at ZT12 in class 1 and ZT15
in classes 2 and 3. For DBP, a key clock controlled transcription
factor driving circadian drug metabolism, the largest peak-totrough differences varied 35- to 61-fold in liver and 4- to 18-fold in
colon according to class. Circadian peak time occurred at ZT12 in
classes 1 and 2 but at ZT9 in class 3 in colon (Fig. 3).

Main molecular patterns differentiating chronotoxicity
classes
This issue was investigated through the application of PCA,
independent component analysis, and factor analysis on the
spectral patterns of the 24-hour liver and colon gene expression
time series. The maximized log-likelihood ratio increased by 20 to
30 decibels, which corresponded to a 100- to 1,000-fold increase,
as a result of the number of factors increasing from 1 to 7.
Similarly, the error degrees of freedom decreased by about 60
following an increase in the number of factors from 1 to 7 (Fig. 4A
and B). The minimum number of factors best describing the data
ranged from 4 to 7 according to organ or class. This result was
conﬁrmed with a sparse PCA method, which further identiﬁed
the most critical gene expression patterns within each factor.
An LDA based on a sparse representation (sparse LDA)
helped determine which gene expression patterns best
discriminate the 3 classes. The 3 most discriminant gene
expression patterns were Rev-erba, Bmal1 and Top1 in liver,
and Rev-erba, Bmal1 and UGT1A1 in colon as shown on a

Per2m/m, this was not the case for the Bmal1, whose amplitude
was decreased by 36% and acrophase was advanced by 1:40 in
males (Fig. 5A).
The administration of irinotecan to Per2m/m mice resulted in
about 3-fold variation in BWL according to circadian timing and
sex. Least toxicity occurred at ZT7 both in male and in female
mice. In contrast, worst toxicity occurred following dosing at
ZT19 in males or ZT15, ZT19, or ZT23 in females (Fig. 5B).
Cosinor analysis and Hotelling t test revealed a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in mean toxicity (P < 0.0001) and a 4-hour
phase advance in females as compared with males (P ¼ 0.00008;
Supplementary Table S1). Thus, the molecular clock, sex, and

genetic background were independent determinants of irinotecan chronotoxicity. Following irinotecan dosing at ZT7, hematologic toxicity was signiﬁcantly worse in Per2m/m as compared
with WT, with regard to counts in circulating leukocytes (4,961 
2,864 vs. 2,937  290, P ¼ 0.035) and lymphocytes (1,450  185 vs.

marrow (2,550  324 vs. 3,270  263, P ¼ 0.10). Furthermore, the
toxic damage for the ileum mucosa was also more severe in
Per2m/m than in WT mice (P ¼ 0.03). Similarly, the count of mean
apoptotic cells increased by 41% in Per2m/m as compared with
WT in the ileum mucosa (Fig. 5C–E). In contrast, no signiﬁcant
genotype-related difference was found for toxic lesions or rate of
apoptotic cells in colon mucosa. Thus, the critical role of Per2 for

the hematologic and ileum toxicities of irinotecan was shown
here for the ﬁrst time. Given the different 24-hour patterns in
Rev-erba and Bmal1 expression in Per2m/m and in the 3 chronotoxicity classes, and the associated distinct irinotecan chronotoxicity patterns, a mathematical model was then sought to
attempt predict for optimal irinotecan timing according to clock
genes as input data.
A Rev-erba and Bmal1 model for predicting irinotecan
chronotoxicity
A linear model was inferred using a MAP Bayesian inference
method. It was ﬁrst trained and validated on the mean circadian time series from 3 chronotoxicity classes (classes 1, 2, and
3) and from female Per2m/m (M1). The prediction was then
tested using data from male B6CBAF1, which belonged to class
3, and male Per2m/m (M2).
The prediction matrix related the toxicity values on the yaxis to the values of Rev-erba and Bmal1 on the x-axis accord-

ing to ZT. Most of the critical information derived from gene
expression was obtained at ZT3 to ZT9 for Rev-erba and at
ZT18 to ZT24 for Bmal1 consistently with raw data displayed
in Fig. 3 (Fig. 6A). The predicted time series clearly overlapped
the real-time series in the 4 groups of the training set (Fig. 6B).
Moreover, an accurate prediction of optimal irinotecan timing
was obtained for the 4 WT strains, through any permutation
between the training set and the validation set. However, the
model did not ﬁt all the real data for M2, as a single representative of a clock mutation was available in the training set.
Nevertheless, the model reliably predicted the dosing time
associated with minimum toxicity for both WT male BCBAF1
at ZT15 and male Per2m/m at ZT7 in the validation set (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Our study is the ﬁrst one that showed that optimal chemotherapy timing could be predicted by clock gene expression

patterns irrespective of sex and genotype. Different circadian
toxicity proﬁles were shown for irinotecan in 3 C57BL/6-based
mouse strains of both sexes despite synchronization with the
same light/dark cycle. Three chronotoxicity classes were identiﬁed. The overall toxicity pattern had a single 24-hour periodic
component for classes 1 and 2, whereas both 24- and 12-hour
components were found for class 3. Optimal timing occurred 4
hours earlier in class 2 as compared with classes 1 and 3. The
magnitude of timing-related improvement in tolerability was
twice as large in class 1 as compared with classes 2 or 3.

class 3. No consistent relation was found here between drug
plasma disposition and toxicity according to circadian timing
among the 3 classes, in agreement with prior reports in male
ICR mice and in patients with cancer (24, 36). Plasma exposure
to irinotecan and other anticancer drugs varied more than 10fold among individual patients with cancer despite the administration of the same dose level, without debated consistent
consequences for adverse events (37, 38). Moreover, a positive
relationship between irinotecan and SN-38 plasma AUCs was
reported for neutropenia but an opposite one for diarrhea in
patients with cancer (22, 39). Indeed, neutropenia was severely
worsened in the patients whose UGT1A1 genotype resulted in

impaired glucuronidation of SN-38 by hepatic UGT1A1
enzymes (40). However, ATP-binding cassette transporters, as
well as sex and race also contributed signiﬁcantly to neutropenia in patients with cancer, with less hematologic toxicity
being reported in female patients (41). In our study, mathematical analysis of 27 genomic circadian time series
pinpointed Rev-erba and Bmal1 clock markers as critical
determinants for both optimal timing and amplitude of the
tolerability rhythm. The relevance of these molecular clock
markers was then validated experimentally in Per2m/m mice
kept under usual photoperiodic synchronization. Furthermore, the circadian amplitude and phase of the mRNA expression of clock-controlled genes Wee1 and DBP varied not only
according to tissue, as earlier reported (42, 43), but also
according to chronotoxicity class. Clock genes Clock, Bmal1,
or Cry and clock-controlled genes DBP, Tef, and Hlf reportedly
moderated cyclophosphamide and/or mitoxantrone toxicities
at 1 or 2 selected times of day (11, 44). However, no prior study
systematically investigated whether clock genes expression
patterns could predict optimal drug timing and the respective
roles of sex and genotype on such prediction.
The preclinical models here placed circadian clocks and
gene expression dynamics at the forefront of the personalization of anticancer therapies. Indeed the predictive value of
genetic signatures about toxicity outcomes was moderated by
host factors, such as sex and race (20, 45, 46). Moreover,
the usefulness of a single genomic tumor assessment for the
identiﬁcation of the most effective drugs was tempered by the
clonal heterogeneity of cancer cells and the dynamic changes
both in gene mutations and epigenetics (47). Our data support
the need for the integration of the molecular clock jointly with
sex and genetic background as critical players in the regulation
of metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis events (Fig. 7). Indeed,

7186

tailoring treatment delivery to the circadian clocks of an
individual has the potential to increase treatment tolerability
several fold. Anticancer drugs, such as irinotecan, not only
target cancer cells but also damage rapidly renewing tissues,
including bone marrow and gut mucosa, sometimes resulting
in life-threatening neutropenia, asthenia, or diarrhea (48, 49). It
is thus crucial to minimize toxicities through personalized
drug timing. Indeed treatment toxicities not only deteriorate
the quality of life of patients with cancer but also impair the
successful development of new anticancer therapies. Recent
clinical data further revealed that the minimization of toxicity
optimized the anticancer efﬁcacy of circadian chronotherapy.
This was not the case for conventional chemotherapy delivery,
where the occurrence of hematologic toxicity usually predicted
for improved efﬁcacy (4, 5, 8).
In summary, the current study showed that the circadian
clock was a critical determinant for achieving several fold
improvements in irinotecan tolerability through its delivery at
an optimal circadian time. However, optimal drug timing ranged
over an 8-hour span according to sex and genetic background
despite exposure to the same light/dark schedule. Mathematical
modeling using circadian expression of clock genes Rev-erba and
Bmal1 as input data enabled accurate prediction of optimal
irinotecan timing, a novel ﬁnding whose relevance now deserves
testing both in experimental settings for other anticancer agents
and in clinical situations for irinotecan.
