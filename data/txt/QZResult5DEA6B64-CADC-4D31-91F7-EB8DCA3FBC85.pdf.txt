ABSTRACT
Purpose: Non-small-cell lung cancers harboring EML4-ALK rearrangements are
sensitive to crizotinib. However, despite initial response, most patients will eventually
relapse, and monitoring EML4-ALK rearrangements over the course of treatment may
help identify these patients. However, challenges associated with serial tumor biopsies
have highlighted the need for blood-based assays for the monitoring of biomarkers.
Platelets can sequester RNA released by tumor cells and are thus an attractive source
for the non-invasive assessment of biomarkers. Methods: EML4-ALK rearrangements
were analyzed by RT-PCR in platelets and plasma isolated from blood obtained from
77 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, 38 of whom had EML4-ALK-rearranged
tumors. In a subset of 29 patients with EML4-ALK-rearranged tumors who were
treated with crizotinib, EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets were correlated with
progression-free and overall survival. Results: RT-PCR demonstrated 65% sensitivity
and 100% specificity for the detection of EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets. In
the subset of 29 patients treated with crizotinib, progression-free survival was 3.7
months for patients with EML4-ALK+ platelets and 16 months for those with EML4-

ALK− platelets (hazard ratio, 3.5; P = 0.02). Monitoring of EML4-ALK rearrangements
in the platelets of one patient over a period of 30 months revealed crizotinib resistance
two months prior to radiographic disease progression. Conclusions: Platelets are a
valuable source for the non-invasive detection of EML4-ALK rearrangements and may
prove useful for predicting and monitoring outcome to crizotinib, thereby improving
clinical decisions based on radiographic imaging alone.

INTRODUCTION

patients with glioma and prostate cancer contained the
cancer-associated RNA biomarkers EGFRvIII and prostate
cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), respectively [14]. Since platelet
RNA can be readily isolated and analyzed, platelets seem
to be an attractive source for the non-invasive monitoring
of biomarkers [15, 16]. However, to the best of our
knowledge, the use of platelets to detect EML4-ALK
rearrangements in patients with NSCLC has not yet been
investigated.
We have assessed the feasibility of detecting EML4ALK rearrangements in platelets and plasma from patients
with NSCLC, with and without EML4-ALK-rearranged
tumors, and from healthy controls. In addition, in a subset
of patients treated with crizotinib we have examined
the potential impact of EML4-ALK rearrangements in
platelets on outcome. We have also monitored EML4ALK rearrangements in platelets from one index patient
throughout the course of treatment.

Cancers driven by genetic alterations are likely to
be sensitive to therapeutic inhibitors targeting the mutated
pathway. For example, causative epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) mutations, present in approximately
16% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC), confer
sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib [1-3]. Rearrangements in
the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, occurring in
2-7% of NSCLC, also define a distinct molecular subtype
of lung cancer [4]. The most common ALK rearrangement
is an inversion that juxtaposes echinoderm microtubuleassociated protein-like 4 (EML4) with ALK and produces
the aberrant EML4-ALK fusion gene, with multiple
chimeric variants, all of which encode the same portion
of ALK but contain different truncations of EML4 [4].
ALK-rearranged tumors depend on ALK for growth and
survival and show marked sensitivity to ALK inhibitors
such as crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib [5-8]. However,
despite initial responses, acquired resistance to these
targeted therapies invariably leads to disease progression.
Approximately one-third of patients with ALKrearranged NSCLC relapse due to an acquired mutation
within the ALK tyrosine kinase domain [9]. EML4-ALK
amplification and bypass signaling, that re-establish
activation of key downstream proliferation and survival
signals despite inhibition of the original oncogene, are
alternative mechanisms of resistance [10].
The assessment of biomarkers of resistance can
facilitate the early identification of patients likely to
relapse, ideally before radiographic imaging provides
evidence of progression. However, while testing biopsied
tumor tissue remains the current recommended method for
mutation analysis, challenges associated with serial tumor
biopsying, particularly in NSCLC, have spurred the search
for non-invasive blood-based assays to allow frequent
assessment of biomarkers as part of routine clinical care.
Tumor cells can release RNA into the blood by a variety
of microvesicle-dependent or -independent mechanisms,
and several models have shown that platelets are crucial
to tumor cell growth, spread, invasion, intravasation,
migration, extravasation, and establishment of distant
metastasis [11-13]. Using confocal microscopy and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we
have previously shown that platelets isolated from healthy
individuals take up RNA-containing membrane vesicles
from cancer cells [14]. Moreover, platelets isolated from

RESULTS
Detection of EML4-ALK rearrangements in
platelets and plasma of NSCLC patients
This study was designed with three parallel
objectives: firstly, to determine the sensitivity and
specificity of detecting EML4-ALK rearrangements in
platelets and plasma, correlated with matched tissue
biopsies; secondly, to examine the potential impact of the
EML4-ALK rearrangement in platelets on outcome to
crizotinib; thirdly, to test the feasibility of monitoring a
patient throughout treatment based on assessment of the
EML4-ALK rearrangement in platelets.
For the first objective, blood samples from 77
patients diagnosed with NSCLC between 2008 and 2014
were collected from public hospitals in The Netherlands
(n = 49), Spain (n = 25), and the United States (n = 3).
Thirty-eight patients had EML4-ALK-rearranged tumors,
detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),
RT-PCR, or both (Figure 1A). Patient characteristics are
shown in Supplementary Table 1. Thirty-five of these
38 patients received crizotinib - nine as first-line, 13 as
second-line, and 13 as further lines of treatment - attaining
an overall response rate (ORR) of 66% and median
progression-free survival (PFS) of seven months (95%
CI, 3.8 to 10.2).

Exosomes transfer RNA to platelets

EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets and
outcome to crizotinib

Figure 1B and 1C demonstrate that exosomes
released by cancer cells are vehicles capable of transferring
tumor-derived EML4-ALK rearranged RNA into platelets,
as shown by confocal microscopy and RT-PCR. Platelets
were isolated from healthy donors and exosomes were
isolated from H2228 EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells. Isolated
exosomes were labelled with PKH67 green fluorescent
dye and subsequently incubated with the blood platelets.
Confocal microscopy was used to confirm that the
PKH67-labeled exosomes derived from H2228 NSCLC
cells were internalized by the platelets (Figure 1B). RTPCR was used to establish exosome-mediated transfer of
tumor-derived EML4-ALK rearranged RNA from cancer
cells to blood platelets. EML4-ALK RNA was detected by
RT-PCR in platelets that were incubated with exosomes
isolated from H2228 NSCLC cells and not in platelets
incubated with exosomes from A549, an EML4-ALK −
NSCLC cell line (Figure 1C).

Of the 35 crizotinib-treated patients, six had blood
samples obtained at the time of progression only and were
not included in the survival analyses, while 29 had blood
samples obtained at baseline and/or during treatment
before progression and were included in the analyses of
PFS, overall survival and response. Median age of the 29
patients was 57 years (range, 37-81); 16 were never or
former smokers; 24 had performance status (PS) 0-1; six
had brain metastases (Supplementary Table 1).
Twenty-three of the 29 patients had only one
blood sample available; six patients had two samples,
obtained at baseline and during treatment. The EML4ALK rearrangement was detected in platelets of 14 of
the 23 patients with only one sample. These 14 patients
were classified as EML4-ALK+, while the remaining
nine were classified as EML4-ALK−. Of the six patients
with two blood samples available, three had EML4-ALK
rearrangement detected at baseline, but lost it during
treatment and therefore classified as EML4-ALK−, for one

case it was the reverse where EML4-ALK could be found
during treatment, hence classified as EML4-ALK+. The
remaining two samples were negative at both occasions. A
total of 15 patients were classified as EML4-ALK+ and 14
as EML4-ALK− (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S2).
With a median follow-up of 13 months (range one
to 48), PFS for all 29 crizotinib-treated patients was 7.0
months (95% confidence intervals [CI], 4.4 to 14.7), while
it was 16 months (95% CI, 5.0 to not reached [NR]) for
the 14 EML4-ALK− patients and 3.7 months (95% CI,
1.1 to 8.7) for the 15 EML4-ALK+ patients (P = 0.01)
(Figure 3A). In the univariate analysis of PFS - including
sex, age, PS, brain metastasis, number of previous lines of
treatment, and EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets only EML4-ALK+ status was associated with shorter PFS
(hazard ratio [HR], 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 10.1; P = 0.02)
(Figure 3A; Supplementary Table S3).
Median overall survival was NR (95% CI, 6.4 to
NR) for all 29 crizotinib-treated patients, while it was
NR (95% CI, 8.0 to NR) for the 14 EML4-ALK− patients
and 6.7 months (95% CI, 2.3 to NR) for the 15 EML4ALK+ patients (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.8 to 11.7; P = 0.11)
(Figure 3B). No variable was identified as a marker of
overall survival in the univariate analysis (Supplementary
Table S3). No significant differences in crizotinib response
were observed between EML4-ALK+ and EML4-ALK−
patients (Supplementary Table S4).

In order to test our hypothesis that the emergence
of acquired resistance can be detected non-invasively
in platelets before radiographic evidence of disease
progression, we monitored a 37-year-old female nonsmoker with NSCLC. EML4-ALK v1 was detected in
her tumor and platelets at baseline in March 2012 (Figure
3C). She responded to crizotinib treatment and the EML4ALK rearrangement was lost in her platelets. During a
one-month interruption of crizotinib treatment due to
appendicitis, the EML4-ALK rearrangement was detected
in her platelets but was lost when she reinitiated crizotinib
treatment. In June 2014, the EML4-ALK rearrangement
was again detected in her platelets; however, positron
emission tomography- computed tomography (PET-CT)
did not show disease progression until two months later,
in August 2014 (Figure 3C).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have examined the use of
platelets and plasma for the non-invasive assessment of
EML4-ALK rearrangements and found that platelets
are a promising biosource. Moreover, the detection
and persistence of EML4-ALK rearrangement in
platelets was significantly associated with shorter PFS
to crizotinib. Interestingly, in the index patient, the

re-appearance of the EML4-ALK rearrangement in
platelets predicted resistance to crizotinib two months
before radiographic progression. Platelets therefore can
be considered alongside other promising biosources,
like plasma, exosomes, circulating-free DNA and
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), all of which have been
proposed as alternative platforms for biomarker analysis
(Supplementary Figure S1) [17-19]. In addition, Klement
et al. have previously demonstrated selective uptake of
tumor derived protein biomarkers in platelets [20, 21].
In the present study, plasma RNA had lower
sensitivity than platelets (21% vs 65%) for the detection
of EML4-ALK rearrangements by RT-PCR. The lower
sensitivity in plasma may be attributed to a rapid
degradation of free-circulating RNA molecules or low
abundance of free-circulating exosomes containing
rearranged EML4-ALK. Several groups have used CTCs
for detection of biomarkers [22]. For example, Pailler et
al., examined ALK rearrangements in CTCs of NSCLC
patients and found four or more ALK-rearranged CTCs
per 1 ml of blood, with 100% sensitivity and speciﬁcity
[17]. Nevertheless, since CTCs typically constitute
of a few cancer cell per tens of millions of normal
nucleated cells in the blood, their use for the detection
of EML4-ALK rearrangements must rely on novel
CTC detection strategies. Circulating-free DNA has
limitations when it comes to large rearrangements, since
finding the chromosomal brake-point needs extensive
deep sequencing of the genomic DNA. Unfortunately,
platelets are not yet stored routinely and prospective
collection is often required to analyze platelet RNA.
Another disadvantage of blood platelets could be their
potential reaction towards certain therapies, resulting in
reduced platelet counts in the blood and potential platelet
activation. However, in direct comparison with the other
liquid biosources for the detection and monitoring of
EML4-ALK rearrangements, platelets are a valid and
competitive biosource when it comes both to detection and
response to therapy, as well as ease of extraction and rapid
readout of the assays. The utility of our EML4-ALK test
in therapy monitoring was illustrated in our index patient
from whom we monitored EML4-ALK rearrangements in
platelets throughout the course of her treatment. This index
case exemplifies the use of serial monitoring of EML4ALK rearrangements in platelets to predict progression,
thereby providing physicians with an early window of
opportunity to modify treatment and switch to a secondgeneration ALK inhibitor, such as ceritinib or alectinib.
EML4-ALK rearrangements in platelets are a
direct readout of the effect of crizotinib on EML4-ALKrearranged NSCLC cells. Adequate crizotinib-mediated
cell eradication results in reduced release of EML4ALK transcripts into circulation, and hence the loss of
platelet EML4-ALK transcripts. By contrast, crizotinib
resistance causes continuous production and release of
EML4-ALK transcripts. The source of DNA in the blood
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of cancer patients are cells that disintegrate by apoptosis
and/or necrosis in expanding tumor tissue [23]. In contrast
RNA released into the blood by microvesicle-dependent
or -independent mechanisms is functionally active in
recipient cells, suggesting that tumor cells can exploit
circulating RNA as a means to ‘communicate’ with
their regional or distal environment [24]. Therefore, an
expressed biomarker (e.g. EML4-ALK RNA molecules)
will tell us more about cellular dysfunctions than
biomarkers derived from apoptotic or necrotic cells (e.g.
fragmented DNA). This further supports non-invasive
RNA based blood tests for the monitoring of ongoing
alterations within the tumor while responding to therapy.
Although patients in our study with EML4-ALK+
platelets had dismal prognosis, our finding can also lead
to potentially beneficial opportunities for treatment in this
subgroup of patients. Recruitment of platelets by tumor
cells is regulated by signaling molecules released by the
tumor or its metastases. One of these molecules is Aggrus/
podoplanin, a protein that attracts platelets expressing the
CLEC-2 receptor [13]. Blocking the binding of Aggrus/
podoplanin to CLEC-2-expressing platelets could be a
novel therapeutic approach with benefit for EML4-ALK+
patients.[25] ALK has recently been shown to regulate
the production of vascular endothelial growth factor A
(VEGFA) in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and EML4ALK-rearranged NSCLC, and the anti-VEGFA antibody
bevacizumab strongly impaired the growth of anaplastic
large-cell lymphoma in mouse xenografts [26]. Activated
platelets release several growth factors, including VEGF
and, therefore, the subset of EML4-ALK+ patients could
likely benefit from anti-angiogenic therapy [13, 26].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
The NSCLC human cell lines H3122 and H2228
were kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Costa (Department
of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA)
and served as positive controls for the variant 1 and the
shorter variant 3 of EML4-ALK transcript, respectively.
The NSCLC human A549 cell line was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) collection.

Isolation of platelet and plasma RNA
Platelets and plasma were isolated from the
same sample of whole blood in 6ml purple-cap BD
Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard
centrifugation. The cells and aggregates were removed by
centrifugation at room temperature for 20 min at 120g,
resulting in platelet-rich plasma. The platelets were
isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation
1072

Oncotarget

at room temperature for 20 min at 360g, after which the
plasma was centrifuged at 360g for 10 min and frozen.
The platelet pellet was collected in 30 µl RNAlater (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and frozen at -80°C for
further use. Platelets and plasma were frozen in parallel.
Platelet RNA and plasma RNA were isolated using
either an Agencourt Formapure (Agencourt Biosciences,
Beverly, MA), miRvana RNA isolation kit (Life
Technologies), or Trizol (Life Technologies), according
to the manufacturers’ instructions. The concentration
and quality of the platelet RNA was determined with
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with total RNA Pico chip
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Platelet RNA of sufficient
quality (Bioanalyzer RIN values >7 and/or distinctive
rRNA curves) was subjected to biomarker analysis. The
quality of plasma RNA could not be measured and only
quantitation of RNA input was used.

cycles in a standard TaqMan program with TaqMan human
GAPDH control reagents (Life Technologies, 402869) as
input control. EML4-ALK breakpoints were confirmed
by Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR products, using the
Big-Dye 1.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). At
Pangaea Biotech, EML4-ALK was amplified by PCR and
visualized in agarose gels. RNA was converted to cDNA
by superscript III (Life Technologies) and amplified
using 40 ng of cDNA and 1U Platinum Taq polymerase
(Invitrogen) in a 20 µl reaction. Specific forward and
reverse primers were used for the three most common
EML4-ALK variants (Supplementary Table S5). EML4ALK breakpoints were confirmed by Sanger sequencing
of RT-PCR products, using the Big-Dye 1.1 sequencing
kit (Applied Biosystems).

Statistical analyses

Isolation and exosome uptake

All participating centers sent samples in a nonconsecutive manner, and there was no stratification
according to sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) PS, smoking history, or prior treatment. PFS
was calculated from the start of crizotinib treatment
until first observation of disease progression by serial
CT and/or PET-CT. Overall survival was calculated from
the start of crizotinib treatment until death from any
cause. Median PFS and overall survival, with their 95%
CIs, were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and
compared using the non-parametric log-rank test. The
association between each potential prognostic factor and
PFS or overall survival was assessed with a univariate
Cox proportional-hazard regression model. All statistical
analyses were performed with the use of SAS V9.3.
Significance was set at P < 0.05.

Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation
using cell culturing medium from EML4-ALK positive
(H2228) and wild type control (A549) NSCLC cell lines.
The medium and plasma was first cleared of debris by
centrifugation; twice at 500xG for 10 minutes, followed
by twice at 2,000xG for 15 minutes, and lastly twice at
10,000xG for 30 minutes. The exosomes in the cleared
sample were pelleted at 100,000xG for 60 minutes. The
exosomes were washed once in PBS before either being
labeling for uptake experiments or DNAse-I treated (4
units; Promega) for 15min before lysis in miRVANA
lysis buffer (Ambion) for RNA extraction (according to
manufacturer’s recommendations) for mutation detection
experiments. Exosome uptake was analyzed using PKH67labeled (Sigma-Aldrich) H2228 microvesicles and the
LSM-710 confocal microscope system with the ZEN 2010
software (Carl Zeiss) and a 63x oil immersion objective
(Carl Zeiss) as previously described [14]. Platelets were
stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen) to indicate
platelet structure and analyzed for exosomal uptake by
the presence of green fluorescent dye PKH67 (SigmaAldrich). EML4-ALK rearranged RNA within platelets
was shown by PCR on reverse transcribed RNA with the
same setup as previously described.
