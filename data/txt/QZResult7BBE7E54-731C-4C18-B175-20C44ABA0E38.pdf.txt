BACKGROUND: Controversies exist with regard to thoracic radiotherapy volumes for limited-stage small cell
lung cancer (SCLC). This study compared locoregional progression and overall survival between limited-stage
SCLC patients who received thoracic radiotherapy to different target volumes after induction chemotherapy.
METHODS: Chemotherapy consisted of 6 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin. After 2 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin,
patients were randomly assigned to receive thoracic radiotherapy to either the postchemotherapy or prechemotherapy tumor extent as study arm or control. Elective nodal irradiation was omitted for both arms. Forty-five Gy/30Fx/
19 days thoracic radiotherapy was administered concurrently with cycle 3 chemotherapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was administered to patients who achieved complete remission. An interim analysis was planned when the first
80 patients had been followed for at least 6 months, for consideration of potential inferiority in the study arm.
RESULTS: Forty-two and 43 patients were randomly assigned to a study arm and a control, respectively. The local recurrence rates were 31.6% (12 of 38) and 28.6% (12 of 42), respectively (P ¼ .81). The isolated nodal failure rates were
2.6% (1 of 38) and 2.4% (1 of 42), respectively (P ¼ 1.00). All isolated nodal failure sites were in the ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa. Mediastinal N3 was the only factor to predict isolated nodal failure (P ¼ .004; odds ratio [OR], 29.33; 95%
CI, 2.94-292.38). One-year and 3-year overall survival rates were 80.6%, 36.2%, and 78.9%, 36.4%, respectively (P ¼ .54).
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results indicated that irradiated postchemotherapy tumor extent and omitted elective
nodal irradiation did not decrease locoregional control in the study arm, and the overall survival difference was not

Lung cancer is a common malignancy of the chest. In clinical practice, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15%
of all lung cancer. Among all diagnosed SCLC patients, about 30% are of limited-stage. Despite high sensitivity to both
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the locoregional recurrence rate could reach 75%-90% when patients were treated with
chemotherapy alone.1 Thoracic irradiation reduced the recurrence rate and increased the long-term survival rate of limitedstage SCLC patients by 5%.2,3 For patients who achieved complete remission of tumor after treatment, a significant

survival benefit to prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI)
was observed with a 3-year survival absolute benefit of
5.4%.4 Chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy is the
standard treatment modality for limited-stage SCLC at
present.
To date, the standard chemotherapy regimen for limited-stage SCLC remains etoposide and cisplatin (EP).5
Although an optimal result with a 5-year survival rate was
26%, and a median survival time of 26 months was
achieved in a prospective phase 3 trial, conducted by Turrisi et al6 with 45Gy/30F/19 days hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy combined with EP chemotherapy at the
first day of radiotherapy, study designs in many prospective
trials regarding radiochemotherapy for limited-stage SCLC
include induction chemotherapy combined with TRT.7-14
Controversies still exist with regard to TRT target volumes
of limited-stage SCLC after chemotherapy, and few prospective studies were designed to solve this issue in the past
2 decades.15 Only data from prospective, nonrandomized
studies were available, not withstanding a trial performed
20 years ago, which is obviously not up-to-date now.
Therefore, we have initiated this prospective
randomized study on TRT target volumes for limitedstage SCLC since June 2002, with a primary objective of
comparing the locoregional progression and overall survival (OS) between limited-stage SCLC patients who
received TRT to postchemotherapy or prechemotherapy
tumor extent after induction chemotherapy while omitting elective nodal irradiation (ENI).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria
Patients were eligible when they had histologic or cytologic verification of SCLC and were radiographically confirmed with limited-stage with no pleural effusion
(including brain computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging [CT/MRI], contrast-agent CT chest and
abdomen, and bone scintigraphy whereas positron-emission tomography and CT was not mandatory). Limitedstage was defined according to the Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Group.16 Patients with contralateral
mediastinal and ipsilateral supraclavicular lymphadenopathy were also included. The patients were aged between
18 and 75 years without previous thoracic radiotherapy,
chemotherapy, or biotherapy. Karnofsky performance status was 80 forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1)

platelet count 100  109/L. Serum creatine and bilirubin were <1.5  the upper normal limit (UNL). Aminotransferase was <2  UNL. Weight loss was less than
10% within 6 months before diagnosis. Written informed
consent was required from all patients.
Exclusion Criteria
Patients were ineligible when they had a history of other
malignant diseases except for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or any contraindications for chemoradiotherapy, malignant pleural and/or
pericardial effusion.
Interventions
Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy consisted of etoposide (100 mg/m2
on days 1 to 3) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 on day 1) administered intravenously at 21-day intervals for 6 cycles. TRT
was administered concurrently with cycle 3 chemotherapy.
Radiotherapy

All patients were immobilized in a supine position
on a vacuum bag with both arms above the head; a contrast-enhanced CT simulation was performed from the
fourth cervical vertebra to the second lumbar vertebra,
using a maximal slice thickness of 5 mm. A three-dimensional treatment planning system was applied to the radiotherapy plan. The targets were contoured in accordance
with the International Commission on Radiation Units
and Measurements (ICRU 50) guidelines. Gross tumor
volume (GTV) included the primary tumor (GTV-T),
prechemotherapy positive lymph nodes (GTV-N) with
lymph nodes in the mediastinum with a short diameter
1 cm, or lymph nodes with positive tumor cell sampling, or clusters of small lymph nodes of short diameter
<1 cm within 1 region, or 18F-FDG standard uptake
value 2.5 on PET/CT at initial staging. For patients
who were randomized to a study arm (ie, to irradiate the
postchemotherapy tumor extent), the clinical target volume-tumor (CTV-T) included the postchemotherapy
GTV-T with a margin of 0.8 cm. For patients who were
randomized to a control arm (ie, to irradiate the prechemotherapy tumor extent), the CTV-T included the prechemotherapy GTV-T with a margin of 0.8 cm. The
clinical target volume-node (CTV-N) included the prechemotherapy positive lymph nodes with a margin of 1.5
cm. The prechemotherapy volumes were contoured on
simulation CT images by referring to corresponding diagnostic CT images performed before induction

chemotherapy. The simulation CT images were matched
with diagnostic CT images by referring to anatomic structures such as vertebrae, fissures, vessels, and bronchus.
The diameter of the contoured tumor extent should be
consistent with preinduction chemotherapy tumor extent
on corresponding diagnostic CT slices. The lymph node
regions originally involved before induction chemotherapy, however, were included in the radiation fields for
both arms even when the lymph node disappeared after
induction chemotherapy. But there was no additional
ENI to cover the uninvolved lymphatics for both arms.
CTVs (include CTV-T and CTV-N) were edited according to anatomy. Planning target volumes (PTV) involved
CTVs with a margin of 1 cm-1.5 cm.
TRT consisted of 1.5 Gy twice a day in 30 fractions
over a 3-week period to a total dose of 45 Gy treated with
a linear accelerator using 6-15-MV photons. The minimal
interval between fractions was 6 hours. Patients who
achieved complete remission (CR) of tumor after the
completion of chemoradiotherapy were offered PCI,
which was delivered daily to a total dose of 30 Gy over a
period of 3 weeks or 25 Gy over 2 weeks.
Follow-up
Patients were reviewed 4-6 weeks after treatment, and every 3 months in the first 2 years, and every 6 months
thereafter. Physical examination and CT scans of the
thorax and upper abdomen were performed routinely.
Response and Toxicity Criteria
Tumor response was evaluated with thoracic CT scans
when induction chemotherapy, TRT, and consolidate
chemotherapy were completed, in accordance with
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Group
(RECIST). During radiotherapy, acute radiation-induced
pneumonitis and esophagitis as well as body weight change
of each patient was recorded, and a complete blood count
was performed at least once a week. Acute hematologic toxicities and weight loss were classified in accordance with the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(CTCAE version 3.0). Acute and late toxicities of lung and
esophagus were evaluated according to RTOG criteria.17
Late toxicities were graded 6 months after TRT.
Study Design and Statistical Analysis
This study was designed as a prospective, randomized,
noninferiority trial. The primary endpoint was local progression. We hypothesized that the 3-year local control
rates for both arms were 80%; sample sizes of 252 in each

280

group achieved 80% power to detect a noninferiority margin difference between the group proportions of 10%.
The study arm proportion was assumed to be 70% under
the null hypothesis of inferiority. The power was computed for the case when the actual study arm proportion
was 80%. The test statistic used was the 1-sided z test
(unpooled). The significance level of the test was targeted
at .025. An interim analysis was designed when the first
group of 80 patients had completed all therapies and were
followed for at least 6 months. The object of this interim
analysis was for consideration of potentially substantial inferiority of locoregional control in the study arm.
Survival time was calculated from time of induction
chemotherapy to the date of death or last follow-up. A statistical software package SPSS 13.0 (IBM, Somers, New
York) was applied, and the Kaplan-Meier method was
used to estimate survival data. The distribution of survival
time between arms was tested by log-rank method; a Student t test was used for comparison of means. Fisher exact
test was used for comparisons of categorical data. Binary
logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact
on outfield recurrence of tumor location (upper, middle,
or lower lobe), tumor type (central or peripheral), T category, N category, and mediastinal N3 disease. All P values
were based on a 2-sided test, and the differences were
regarded as statistically significant when P < .05.
The protocol was approved by the clinical ethics
committee of Sun Yat Sen University Cancer Center
before study activation.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between June 2002 and January 2010, a total of consecutive
86 patients with limited-stage SCLC were enrolled onto the
study. One patient was ineligible because of a second primary small cell lung cancer. The characteristics of the 85 eligible patients were well balanced in 2 arms (Table 1).
Chemotherapy
All patients received 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy.
After that, 4 patients of the study arm and 1 patient of the
control arm developed distant metastasis and received palliative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. For the remaining
patients, the average total cycles of chemotherapy administered in the study arm and control arm were 5.3  0.7
and 5.3  0.8, respectively (P ¼ .94). Table 2 shows the
actual mean dose-intensity (mg/m2/w) in each treatment

Toxicity
Hematologic and nonhematologic acute and late toxicities
are summarized in Table 3. Hematologic toxicity was
mild to moderate in both arms; severe hematologic toxicity was infrequent. There were no significant differences
in acute nonhematologic toxicity between the arms except
for weight loss, although it was mild. Late toxicities of
radiotherapy were mainly mild to moderate pulmonary
and esophageal injury. Six (15.8%) patients developed
grade II-III pulmonary injury in the control arm, and 1
(2.8%) patient in the study arm (P ¼ .10). Late spinal
cord toxicity was not observed.

DISCUSSION
At present, the combined chemoradiotherapy has been
established as a standard treatment modality for limitedstage SCLC. However, wide controversies exist with
regard to radiation target volume as TRT is concerned.1,18
Two main questions with regard to the design of

irradiation volume for limited-stage SCLC after induction
chemotherapy are prominent, namely, should we treat
with the postchemotherapy or the prechemotherapy tumor volume? Is ENI necessary?
Up until now, there are only 2 prospective studies
especially designed to solve these problems.19,20 Whereas
results from retrospective studies of the 2-dimensional
radiotherapy and nonplatinum-based chemotherapy era
were not consistent with each other.21-24
The only phase III Southwest Oncology Group
(SWOG) trial randomized 191 patients who achieved partial response or stable disease after induction chemotherapy
to receive either postinduction or preinduction tumor field
radiation. The corresponding recurrence rates were similar
in both arms: 32% and 28%, respectively, and the difference of median survival time was not statistically significant
(51 weeks vs 46 weeks, P ¼ .73). However, life threatening
and lethal toxicities were more common in the wide-volume radiotherapy arm than in the reduced-volume radiotherapy arm (17 of 93 vs 8 of 98).19

De Ruysscher et al20 conducted a phase 2 study
based on CT-simulated radiotherapy reporting isolated
nodal relapse rates after omitting ENI in patients with
limited-stage SCLC. A crude isolated nodal failure rate of
11% was reported, higher than the authors’ expectation.
But due to the small sample size in the study, no definitive
conclusions could be drawn.
The above-mentioned prospective trials each studied 1 of the 2-sided issues regarding TRT volume. Comparing them, this clinical trial was designed prospectively
to include both aspects of this issue, ie, to treat with the
postchemotherapy or the prechemotherapy tumor volume
and omit ENI for both arms. (Table 6).
In our study, isolated outfield recurrent rate was
2.6% (1 of 38) and 2.4% (1 of 42), respectively, in the
study arm and control arm (P ¼ 1.00). All outfield recurrent sites were exclusively in the ipsilateral supraclavicular
fossa, which were the same as the results reported by De
Ruysscher et al20
As for the anatomy in the supraclavicular fossa, is it
possible that its complicated structures will result in

omission of tiny metastatic lymph nodes and outfield recurrence? There is some evidence that indicates 18FFDG-PET/CT provides more accurate staging and prognosis judgment for SCLC patients than ordinary contrasted CT scan.25-31 PET/CT was able to detect 5.0% to
12.5% supraclavicular lymph nodes, which were originally negative on ordinary contrasted CT scans.28-31 van
Loon J et al31 first reported their prospective study evaluating the role of PET/CT guided selective nodal irradiation; only 2 (3%) patients experienced an isolated nodal
recurrence, and 1 of them was in the supraclavicular
region. However, further investigations of the value of
PET/CT in detecting supraclavicular lymphadenopathy
are warranted because of lacking of prospective, largescale, pathologically proven studies.
In a prospective study including 117 lung cancer
patients comparing the value of palpation, ultrasonography (US), and CT in diagnosing metastasis of supraclavicular lymph nodes, van Overhagen et al32 performed USguided fine-needle aspiration cytological analysis in
patients with supraclavicular nodes with a short-axis diameter of 5 mm or greater. Cytological diagnosis was used
as the standard of reference. The authors reported that
CT (P ¼ .001) and US (P<.001) were significantly more
sensitive than palpation for detecting supraclavicular metastasis, but there was no significant difference between
CT and US (P ¼ .06).
In the study conducted by De Ruysscher et al,20
patients experiencing supraclavicular fossa relapse were all
unexceptionally with mediastinal N3 nodal disease. van
Overhagen et al32 also reported in their study that 93%
(28 of 30) of lung cancer patients with supraclavicular
lymph nodes metastasis were found to have N2 or N3
nodes at chest CT. Moreover, supraclavicular lymph
nodes metastases were seen more frequently in patients
with N3 nodes at chest CT than in patients with N0 to
N2 nodes (P < .001). In patients with enlarged N3 nodes
at chest CT, there was a 51% chance that supraclavicular
lymph nodes metastasis were present and could be proved
cytologically. In our study, 80% (4 of 5) patients who
experienced supraclavicular fossa failure had mediastinal
N3 nodal disease (Table 6). This type of N3 disease was
the only factor that was found to predict supraclavicular
fossa outfield relapse.
In this study, no patients developed outfield recurrence of mediastinal lymph nodes. One of the reasons
may lie in that when the primary tumor and metastatic
lymph nodes were irradiated, mediastinal lymph drainage
also received incidental irradiation for a certain amount of

dosage. There are some dosimetric studies available on incidental nodal irradiation for nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).33-35 Ronsenzweig et al35 reported in a series of
NSCLC patients of whom 86% had stage III disease.
When 50.4 to 81 Gy were delivered using 3-dimensional
conformal radiotherapy, more than 40 Gy of incidental
irradiation to the ipsilateral superior mediastinum, inferior mediastinum, and subcarinal regions was observed in
34%, 64%, and 41% of patients, respectively. However,
no similar study was reported in limited-stage SCLC, and
further investigations are warranted.
As for infield recurrence, some studies indicated
that higher irradiation doses may be suggested to enhance
local control thus further improve long-term survival.6,7,11,36 A CALGB phase III trial NCT 0063285337
is currently under development that compares a 45-Gy
twice-daily dose with a 2 Gy once-daily to 70 Gy and
61.2 Gy dose in a concomitant boost approach, in combination with concurrent EP regimen chemotherapy.
Another currently ongoing trial NCT 0043356338 also
compares 45-Gy twice-daily dose with a 2 Gy once-daily
to 66 Gy concomitantly with EP regimen chemotherapy.
We look forward to seeing whether the higher dose
yielded in the study arms could be translated into
improved local control and survival.
We have realized the limitations of this study. First,
we did not perform a CT-simulation scan for patients
before induction chemotherapy; this may have introduced
error when CTV-T was contoured for the control arm. As
we have noticed this, after these first 85 patients were
included, all newly accrued patients underwent CT simulation before induction chemotherapy. Second, the followup time was relatively short for some patients but was not
likely to significantly alter the current results. Third, TRT
was administered with cycle 3 of chemotherapy in this
study. When the study was designed and initiated in 2002,
the timing of TRT (early vs late) was not established and
was still controversial. With recent evidence,39,40 we realize
that delayed initiation of TRT results in inferior response
and survival in patients with SCLC. In future studies, we
will administer TRT earlier with chemotherapy for limited-stage SCLC patients.
In summary, the preliminary results indicated that
irradiation to the postchemotherapy tumor extent and
omission of ENI did not decrease local control while significantly fewer patients suffered from grade 1 weight loss.
However, patients in the control arm achieved better OS
than in the study arm, although the difference was not
statistically significant.

Original Article

The current sample size has not met designed
requirements, caution must be taken when adopt the conclusions. Because of the slow accrual, we are going to initiate a multicenter randomized trial designed much the
same as this study, but the new trial will initiate TRT earlier with chemotherapy, and patients with mediastinal N3
disease will receive prophylactic irradiation to the ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa.
