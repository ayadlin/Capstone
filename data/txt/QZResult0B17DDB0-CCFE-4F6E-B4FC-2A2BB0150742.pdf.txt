Abstract
Aromatase inhibitors are the major ﬁrst-line treatment of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, but
resistance to treatment is common. To date, no biomarkers have been validated clinically to guide subsequent
therapy in these patients. In this study, we mapped the genome-wide chromatin-binding proﬁles of estrogen
receptor a (ERa), along with the epigenetic modiﬁcations H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, that are responsible for
determining gene transcription (n ¼ 12). Differential binding patterns of ERa, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 were
enriched between patients with good or poor outcomes after aromatase inhibition. ERa and H3K27me3 patterns
were validated in an additional independent set of breast cancer cases (n ¼ 10). We coupled these patterns to
array-based proximal gene expression and progression-free survival data derived from a further independent
cohort of 72 aromatase inhibitor–treated patients. Through this approach, we determined that the ERa and
H3K27me3 proﬁles predicted the treatment outcomes for ﬁrst-line aromatase inhibitors. In contrast, the
H3K4me3 pattern identiﬁed was not similarly informative. The classiﬁcation potential of these genes was only
partially preserved in a cohort of 101 patients who received ﬁrst-line tamoxifen treatment, suggesting some
treatment selectivity in patient classiﬁcation. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6632–41. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy
among women worldwide, with annually around 1.4 million
new cases and half a million patients who die from the disease
each year (1). Seventy-ﬁve percent of all breast tumors are of
the luminal subtype and tumor cell proliferation is thought to
depend on activity of the estrogen receptor a (ERa). Inhibition
of ERa by endocrine therapy is therefore a major treatment
modality for these tumors, either by tamoxifen or the state-ofthe-art aromatase inhibitors. Although many studies have
focused on deﬁning predictive markers for tamoxifen resistance, relatively little is known about the molecular determinants of aromatase inhibitor response. Such knowledge is

essential as intrinsic and acquired resistance to treatment is
common (2, 3). Whole-genome sequencing analyses on breast
tumor samples revealed a set of 18 genes to be mutated in
patients with breast cancer that correlated with differential
survival upon aromatase inhibitor treatment (4), including
PI3K, TP53, MAP3K1, and GATA3. These data were supported
by other reports, indicating differential gene expression pathways to be enriched in poor versus good outcome patients
upon aromatase inhibitor treatment (5, 6).
ERa–binding proﬁle assessment in breast cancer cell lines
has greatly increased our knowledge of hormonal receptor
action. ERa rarely binds promoters and most estrogen receptor/chromatin interactions occur at distal enhancers (7),
which are involved in chromatin loop structures to regulate
gene expression (8). ERa/chromatin interactions require the
functional involvement of other proteins, including FOXA1.
FOXA1 is one of the key luminal-deﬁning transcription factors
(9, 10) and acts as pioneer factor for ERa by untangling
chromatin structures, which enables ERa to bind its targets
as shown in cell lines (11) and breast tumor samples (12). Other
pioneer factors have been described for ERa function, including AP-2g (13) and PBX1 (14), which function in synergy with
FOXA1 in enabling ERa/chromatin interactions and subsequent activity. These reports tightly link ERa action with
chromatin structure.
The epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure is a highly
complex interplay between multiple histone modiﬁers and
their downstream histone modiﬁcations, each with their
intrinsically distinct patterns and functions (15). Two of the
best-studied histone marks are the repressive trimethylation

on lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3; ref. 16) and the activating
trimethylation on lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me3; ref. 17).
H3K4me3 is found enriched at promoter regions (18, 19),
whereas H3K27me3 can be found over large genomic regions
spanning one or more epigenetically silenced genes (20, 21),
which is directly regulated by the EZH2-driven polycomb
repressive complex PRC2 (22).
To test for a possible interplay between differential ERa
binding and epigenetic regulation of gene activity, we determined the genome-wide chromatin-binding patterns of
ERa, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 in primary breast tumor
samples. Following relapse, patients were treated with an
aromatase inhibitor for metastatic disease and time to
progression (TTP) was correlated with altered ERa/
H3K4me3/H3K27me3 binding proﬁles to identify distinct
patterns that could hallmark aromatase inhibitor resistance.

Materials and Methods
Patients, tumor samples, and processing
The Erasmus University Medical Center (EMC; Rotterdam,
the Netherlands), the Netherlands Cancer Institute (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and the Translational Cancer Research
Unit (Saint Augustinus Hospital, Antwerpen, Belgium) participated in this study. A detailed description of the tumor
samples has been described previously (23) and can be found
in the Supplementary Methods.
In addition, previously described dataseries from patients
with breast cancer, receiving neoadjuvant letrozole treatment
(6) or tamoxifen for metastatic disease (24) were applied.
Chromatin immunoprecipitations
Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) were performed
as described before (25) with minor adjustments. Firstly, as
input material, tumor samples were cryosectioned (30 30 mm
sections) before further processing for ChIP-seq. For each
ChIP, 10 mg of antibody was used, and 100 mL of Protein A
magnetic beads (Invitrogen). ERa (SC-543; Santa Cruz),
H3K4me3 (ab8580; Abcam), and H3K27me3 (07–449; Millipore) were used as antibodies. Primer sequences for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses are in Supplementary Table S5.
Solexa sequencing and enrichment analysis
ChIP DNA was ampliﬁed as described (25). Sequences were
generated by the Illumina Hiseq 2000 genome analyzer (using
50 bp reads), and aligned to the Human Reference Genome
(assembly hg19, February 2009). Enriched regions of the
genome were identiﬁed by comparing the ChIP samples to
mixed input using the MACS peak caller (26) version 1.3.7.1.
Details on the number of reads obtained, the percentage of
reads aligned, and the number of peaks called can be found in
Supplementary Table S3. Bioinformatic analyses are described
in the Supplementary Methods.
RNA isolation and mRNA expression analysis
Total tumor RNA was isolated as described previously (27).
mRNA quality was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) and bioanalyzer. Ampliﬁcation, labeling, and
hybridization of samples to 44k mRNA oligonucleotide-arrays

www.aacrjournals.org

(Agilent Technologies) were performed as described (27).
Samples were hybridized against a breast cancer reference
pool consisting of RNA from 105 primary breast tumors. A
detailed description of mRNA expression analyses and progression-free survival analyses can be found in the Supplementary Methods.
Data access
All genomic data are deposited at the NCBI GEO, with
accession numbers GSE40867 (ChIP-seq data) and GSE41994
(expression data).

Results
Genome-wide binding patterns of ERa, H3K4me3, and
H3K27me3 in primary breast tumor specimens
Fresh frozen primary tumor specimens from a cohort of 84
patients with breast cancer were tested. These patients
received aromatase inhibitor treatment of metastatic disease,
i.e., anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane (Supplementary
Table S2). TTP was taken as an endpoint (Fig. 1A). Poor
outcome patients were deﬁned as patients with a TTP < 12
months, whereas good outcome patients were deﬁned as
patients with a TTP > 24 months (Supplementary Tables S1
and S2). To determine the differential patterns in the ERa/
chromatin–binding landscape and the epigenetic modiﬁcations H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 as well as their possible
correlations with outcome after aromatase inhibitor treatment, ﬁve good outcome tumor samples and seven poor
outcome tumors were randomly selected as "discovery set."
Remaining samples from the entire cohort were used as
"validation sets," as will be discussed later. The tumor cell
percentage was consistently high (>70%), and all tumors were
ERa and progesterone receptor (PR) positive, whereas negative
for HER2. Other clinicopathologic parameters are shown in
Supplementary Table S2.
For all 12 tumors from the discovery set, fresh frozen
samples were cryosectioned, and chromatin was isolated for
ChIP. For each tumor sample, the ChIP for ERa, H3K4me3, and
H3K27me3 was performed and isolated DNA fragments were
analyzed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq; ref. 25).
The number of aligned reads, unique reads, and number of
peaks for each ChIP-seq sample are shown in Supplementary
Table S3. Clear and distinct peaks were observed for each
condition, as exempliﬁed for one tumor sample (good
outcome tumor #5; Fig. 1B). In this example specimen,
13,575 binding events for ERa, 19,012 binding events for
H3K4me3, and 33,661 binding events for H3K27me3 were
found. Although the vast majority of binding events found
from this tissue sample were unique among the markers,
overlap was found between ERa and H3K4me3 as well as
between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (Fig. 1C; for all tumor
samples, see Supplementary Fig. S1). Even though the total
numbers of binding events greatly varied among tumors, these
relative distributions of the three ChIP conditions were consistently found for all tumor samples tested (Supplementary
Fig. S1). For the exempliﬁed tumor sample, motif analysis was
performed for each ChIP condition, Fig. 1D. As expected, ERa–
binding events were enriched for ESR1 motifs, but also for its

designated pioneer factors FOXA1 (7) and TFAP2 (13). For
H3K4me3 ChIP on this tumor sample, enriched motifs were
found for the promoter-selective transcription factors GTF2I
(28), ZIC1 (29), and E2F1:TFDP2 (30), whereas only motifs for
the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) were
observed for H3K27me3-bound regions.
For all tested tumor samples, example binding events for
ERa, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 are shown (Fig. 1E), illustrating clear and high-quality data for all samples. For one tumor
sample, no data could be generated for the H3K4me3 ChIP
(poor outcome sample #2). Most ERa–binding events were
found at distal enhancers and introns (Fig. 1F), consistent with
previous reports in cell lines (7) and breast tumors (12).
H3K4me3 was more markedly enriched at promoters, 30 -UTRs

and exons, this in contrast to H3K27me3. These distributions
were consistent in all analyzed tumors studied. The binding
site distributions of all peaks related to the most proximal gene
were found not to differ between good and poor outcome
tumors.
Distinct genome-wide binding patterns of ERa,
H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 correlate with patient survival
after aromatase inhibitor treatment
Next, we aimed to determine whether the chromatin-binding patterns of ERa-, H3K4me3-, and H3K27me3–binding
events would deviate between patients with a good versus
a poor outcome upon aromatase inhibitor treatment. This
was achieved through differential binding analysis (DBA;

refs. 12, 31), directly comparing good outcome and poor
outcome tumor ChIP-seq data. DBA normalizes the sequencing data for each run over the effective library size (reads in
peaks) after input background subtraction, and determines
relative enrichment of raw sequence reads over two distinct
subgroups of tumor samples, in this case good versus poor
outcome. Called peaks that were found in at least two tumor
samples were considered for DBA to minimize noise, resulting
in 14,232 peaks for ERa, 22,587 peaks for H3K4me3, and 35,602
peaks for H3K27me3 (Supplementary Fig. S2). On the basis of
these peaks, the raw read counts for all tumor samples were
checked for differential binding intensities between the two
patient subgroups, resulting in lists of 222 (ERa), 66 (H3K4me3),
and 351 (H3K27me3) peaks, with a false discovery rate of < 0.1
(Fig. 2A). Tumors from patients with the same outcome clustered together for ERa and H3K27me3 and, although less
pronounced, for the H3K4me3 signals (Fig. 2B). This class
separability was also observed in a principal component analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). The read count and peak caller
score did not bias patient stratiﬁcation (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Peak regions that were signiﬁcantly differentially enriched
between the poor and good outcome patients are shown in a
heatmap for all three conditions (Fig. 2C), with a clear distinction for ERa and H3K27me3, whereas case mixing was
observed for H3K4me3 signals. The number of poor outcome
peaks greatly outweighs the number of good outcome events
for both histone marks, but not for ERa (Fig. 2D). A list of all
differentially bound regions between good and poor outcome
for ERa, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 is shown in Supplementary
Table S4.
The binding events that were differentially enriched
between the two patient subgroups were analyzed for their
localization relative to the most proximal genes (Fig. 2E). No
clear differences in genomic locations of the ERa peaks were
observed between good and poor outcome patients.
H3K4me3 poor outcome peaks were found enriched at 30 UTR regions and downstream thereof, whereas the 30 -UTR
signals for H3K27me3-binding events were selectively lost
in poor outcome tumor samples.
The ERa-, H3K4me3-, and H3K27me3–binding events were
analyzed for DNA motifs differentially enriched in the good
and poor outcome patient subgroups (Fig. 2F). Although only
ESR1 motifs were found in good outcome patients, TFAP2A
and TCF4 motifs were enriched next to ESR1 for the poor
outcome patients. For H3K27me3, good outcome–enriched
binding events were enriched for TERF1 and PPARG:RXRA
motifs, whereas for poor outcome–enriched binding events,
motifs were found for ERG and SIX1/SIX3. No distinct enriched
motifs were found for the good outcome–enriched binding
event for H3K4me3, but the poor outcome sites were statistically enriched for LHX2/GBX2, ARID5B, PAX7, and HOXB8
motifs.
Mutual exclusivity of differentially enriched chromatinbinding events between the patient subgroups
A large variation was found in the number (Supplementary
Table S2) and overlap of chromatin-binding events between
samples as exempliﬁed for three specimens (Fig. 3A; for all

www.aacrjournals.org

samples Supplementary Fig. S2). This is consistent with a
previous report that studied ERa ChIP-seq on breast tumor
specimens (12). Because ERa/chromatin interactions are dictated by and have a facilitating effect on histone accessibility
(11), we determined if altered ERa–binding patterns are
accompanied by changes in the epigenetic proﬁle of H3K4me3
and H3K27me3. When ERa–binding events observed in the
poor outcome tumor sample were absent in the good outcome
tumor, these alterations are not accompanied by a loss or gain
of proximal histone marks, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 3B. In line
with these data, differences of either histone mark between
good and poor outcome patients were virtually mutually
exclusive and not shared with changed ERa–binding patterns
(Fig. 3C). Consequently, a limited overlap was observed for the
genes that were proximal to the altered ERa-, H3K4me3-, and
H3K27me3–binding events (Fig. 3D). The altered binding
events were mapped over all chromosomes and no clear
bias towards distinct regions or chromosomes was observed
(Fig. 3E).
Validation, integration with gene expression, and
clinical outcome
Next, differential enriched binding patterns between good
and poor outcome patients were validated in an independent
group of 10 patients (4 good outcome and 6 poor outcome)
using qPCR, Fig. 4A (for clinicopathologic parameters, see
Supplementary Table S2). For each of the ChIP conditions,
four to six primer pairs were designed, detecting randomly
picked regions enriched in the good or poor outcome patients
from the discovery set. ChIP efﬁciency can vary among
samples due to tumor cell percentage, expression levels, and
experimental variations, making inter-sample normalization
an essential step in the DBA for the ChIP-seq pipeline. To
implement inter-sample normalization in qPCR, the ratios of
average good outcome over poor outcome–enriched binding
site intensities were calculated. For ERa and H3K27me3, qPCR
ratio separated poor outcome patients from good outcome
patients, whereas differential enrichment could not be conﬁrmed for H3K4me3.
After qPCR validation, all ChIP-seq–identiﬁed differential
binding patterns were coupled to genes, based on proximity
(gene body plus 20 kb upstream from the transcription startsite), enriching for ERa–binding sites involved in gene regulation (8). For the good outcome binding sites, this resulted in
84 (ERa), 19 (H3K4me3), and 29 (H3K27me3) genes. For poor
outcome sites, 99 (ERa), 22 (H3K4me3), and 158 (H3K27me3)
genes were found (Supplementary Table S6).
Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were performed on the proximal gene sets to identify plausible functional regulatory networks (Supplementary Table S7). Genes between the different
classiﬁers only marginally overlapped (Fig. 3D), whereas pathways between ERa, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3-based classiﬁers showed no overlap. The ERa–based classiﬁer was
enriched for metabolic processes, whereas nucleoside transport, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis were enriched GO terms
for H3K4me3. For the H3K27me3 classiﬁer, developmental
processes were strongly enriched. Comparing our data with
pathways identiﬁed in mutational analysis of aromatase

classiﬁers remained signiﬁcant after multivariate correction
analyses (Supplementary Table S9). The classiﬁer genes are
listed in Supplementary Table S6. As a second expressionbased validation, a cohort of neoadjuvant letrozole treatment
patients (N ¼ 54) was used, analyzing samples before and after
treatment, where patients were stratiﬁed in responsive and
non-responsive groups (Fig. 4C; refs. 5, 6). PAM50, Oncotype
DX, and TAM78 as well as our ChIP-seq classiﬁers successfully
identiﬁed patients with differential outcome.
ERa can affect gene regulation by long-range genomic
chromatin-loop interactions, as shown by ERa ChIA-PET
(8). Therefore, these published long-range interactions were
also considered in our study. In addition, binding sites were
analyzed for any transcription factor enrichment, DNAse
hypersensitivity, and H3K27Ac, representing active enhancers
(35), using ENCODE datasets (Supplementary Table S10).
Genes were selected that either had a binding event at a
promoter region, or chromatin looping toward the promoter
was found, generating three separate lists of 92 (ERa), 38
(H3K4me3), and 150 (H3K27me3) genes. Overlap between the
"proximity-based" and "ChIA-PET–based" gene sets was high
for H3K4me3 (76%) and H3K27me3 (78%), but considerably
lower for ERa (49%; Supplementary Fig. S5). Analogous to our
initial classiﬁers, ChIA-PET–based classiﬁers for ERa (P ¼
0.0041; HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.41–4.26) and H3K27me3 (P ¼ 0.0002;
HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.73–5.27) could classify patients, in contrast
to H3K4me3 (P ¼ 0.606; HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.71–2.37; Supplementary Fig. S6A and Supplementary Table S9). Also for this
"ChIA-PET–based" classiﬁer, samples from the neoadjuvant
treated letrozole cohort were analyzed (6), identifying patients
with differential response (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Conserved genes between both gene classiﬁers performed equally
as the separate classiﬁcations (ERa: P ¼ 0.05; HR, 1.96, 95% CI,
1.10–3.49; H3K27me3: P ¼ 0.0001; HR, 3.68, CI 95%, 2.09–6.50;
H3K4me3: P ¼ 0.3944; HR, 1.30, 95% CI, 0.711–2.37; Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D).
A third cohort of patients was analyzed, receiving ﬁrst-line
tamoxifen for metastatic disease instead of aromatase inhibitors (Fig. 4D; ref. 27). The metastatic setup of this cohort
enabled a direct comparison between the patient sets. No
signiﬁcant correlation with TTP after tamoxifen was found
for the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq–based classiﬁers
(H3K27me3: P ¼ 0.0838, HR, 1.53, 95% CI, 0.95–2.47; and
H3K4me3: P ¼ 0.0602, HR, 1.556, 95% CI, 0.98–2.47). However,
signiﬁcance was reached for the ERa–based classiﬁer (P ¼
0.0426, HR, 1.63, 95% CI, 1.02–2.63). These data indicate that
while the ERa ChIP-seq–based classiﬁer may identify breast
cancer patients with a poor outcome, irrespective of the type
of endocrine treatment, the H3K27me3 classiﬁcation suggests
aromatase inhibitor–treatment selectivity in patients with
metastatic breast cancer (Fig. 4E).

Discussion
Estrogen receptor genomics has greatly increased our
knowledge of hormone receptor functioning in breast cancer
cell lines and tumors. The number of ERa/chromatin–binding
events greatly exceeds the amount of estradiol-responsive
genes (11, 36), suggesting a high level of complexity in ERa–

www.aacrjournals.org

mediated gene regulation (8). ERa/chromatin–binding events
have been found to correlate with survival of patients with
breast cancer (12), but survival in this heterogeneous study also
correlated with traditional pathologic parameters, including
PR and HER2, potentially hampering further clinical interpretation of the data. Therefore, we selected ERaþ, PRþ, and
HER2 tumors from a homogeneous cohort of breast cancer
patients whose metastasis were all treated with aromatase
inhibitors.
Altered ERa–binding patterns between patient groups were
not accompanied with altered epigenetic proﬁles of H3K4me3
and H3K27me3. Our data suggest that any dynamic behavior of
ERa uses the accessible regions in the genome that are
imprinted and readily accessible in a static epigenetic landscape. Still, H3K27me3-binding events enable the identiﬁcation of patients with a poor outcome after aromatase inhibitor
treatment, in contrast to H3K4me3. The presented data suggest that aromatase inhibitor resistance is accompanied by a
speciﬁc gain of polycomb-mediated gene repression at distinct
sites. Moreover, it suggests an ERa–independent mechanism
of therapy resistance in ERa–positive tumors. Our data could
be validated in two other cohorts of breast cancer patients,
using two different technologic approaches, namely ChIPqPCR and gene expression analysis.
Because genomic patterns of ERa and H3K27me3 were
indicative for patient survival, the enriched motifs may provide
clues for transcription factors involved in treatment outcome.
For ERa, TFAP2 and TCF4 motifs were selectively enriched for
the poor outcome patients. AP-2 can directly guide ERa/
chromatin interactions (13), promotes breast cancer cell proliferation (37), and correlates with poor outcome (38). TCF4
enhances breast cancer cell invasion (39) and binds ERa (40),
providing a level of cross-control between estradiol and wnt
pathways (40).
For H3K27me3, "good outcome" sites were enriched for
TERF1 and PPARG:RXRA motifs. TERF1 is a component of
the telomere nucleoprotein complex. SNPs in TERF1 have been
tested for breast cancer susceptibility and prognosis, but no
correlations were found (41). PPARG:RXRA ligands can trigger
breast cancer cell apoptosis (42) and PPARg activation blocks
breast cancer cell invasion (43) and induces terminal cell
differentiation (44). For poor outcome–enriched H3K27me3
regions, motifs were found for ERG and SIX1/SIX3. ERG and
ERa mutually repress each other's activities (45). SIX1 is
expressed in breast cancer, stimulating tumor cell proliferation
(46), inducing genomic instability and malignant transformation (47), correlating with poor prognosis (48). Collectively,
these data highlight possible transcriptional mechanisms that
may form the basis for aromatase inhibitor response.
The ERa ChIP-seq classiﬁer was applicable for aromatase
inhibitor- and tamoxifen–treated patients with breast cancer
with metastatic disease. Because aromatase inhibitors and
tamoxifen both affect the functionality of ERa, the genomic
downstream signatures for treatment outcome could overlap
as well. Because ERa is targeted by these endocrine agents, the
ChIP-seq approach could aid in removing noise from expression analyses to exclusively monitor genes that are directly
affected by this hormone receptor.

Jansen et al.

Testing the aromatase inhibitor ChIP-seq classiﬁers in tamoxifen-treated tumors showed no signiﬁcant difference in TTP for
H3K27me3. Aromatase inhibitor–treated patients cohorts are
relatively rare, and our cohort is on metastatic disease. To
compare between endocrine treatments, data from a metastatic
cohort of tamoxifen-treated patients were used. Performing
these ERa ChIP-seq experiments and epigenetic assessments
in the adjuvant setting would enable a direct comparison with
any of the large (adjuvant-treated) breast cancer patient cohorts
(34, 49, 50) for more extensive in silico validations.
Tumor-intrinsic plasticity of ERa and H3K27me3 can be a
hallmark of endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer and
may ultimately be applicable to guide endocrine treatment
selection for patients with breast cancer.
