Abstract
Hec1 is a conserved mitotic regulator critical for spindle
checkpoint control, kinetochore functionality, and cell survival. Overexpression of Hec1 has been detected in a variety of
human cancers and is linked to poor prognosis of primary
breast cancers. Through a chemical genetic screening, we have
identified a small molecule, N-(4-[2,4-dimethyl-phenyl]-thiazol-2-yl)-benzamide (INH1), which specifically disrupts the
Hec1/Nek2 interaction via direct Hec1 binding. Treating cells
with INH1 triggered reduction of kinetochore-bound Hec1 as
well as global Nek2 protein level, consequently leading to
metaphase chromosome misalignment, spindle aberrancy,
and eventual cell death. INH1 effectively inhibited the
proliferation of multiple human breast cancer cell lines in
culture (GI50, 10–21 Mmol/L). Furthermore, treatment with
INH1 retarded tumor growth in a nude mouse model bearing
xenografts derived from the human breast cancer line MDAMB-468, with no apparent side effects. This study suggests that
the Hec1/Nek2 pathway may serve as a novel mitotic target
for cancer intervention by small compounds. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Mitosis is a highly complex stage of the cell cycle that requires
coordinated efforts among multiple regulators for proper spindle
formation and efficient chromosome segregation. Spindle poisons
represented by taxanes and Vinca alkaloids are a class of
conventional anticancer chemotherapeutics that kill cells by
targeting mitotic machinery (1). However, these drugs are known
to elicit severe pathologic side effects in part due to the importance
of microtubules in normal tissues (2). Some mitotic kinases, such
as Aurora A and B, Plk1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1, have been
considered as alternative targets (3). Mitotic kinesins (KSP/Eg5 and
CENP-E) are another class of prospective targets (4, 5). The primary
function of KSP is to regulate centrosome separation and spindle
formation (6, 7). On the other hand, CENP-E is required for both
kinetochore assembly and spindle checkpoint control by sensing
the attachment of K-fibers (8). Inhibition of CENP-E allows
mitotically defective cancer cells to exit mitosis prematurely, thus

promoting mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Inhibitors for the
above mitotic targets have been developed and are in clinical
development at present (3). However, evidence linking the above
molecules to cancers remains sparse, except the oncogenic
amplification of Aurora A kinase in several types of human cancers.
Hec1, a kinetochore outer layer component and spindle
checkpoint regulator, is of particular interest because it clearly
has association with cancer progression. Hec1 directly interacts
with multiple kinetochore components, including Nuf2, Spc25, and
Zwint-1, and with mitotic kinases Nek2 and Aurora B (9).
Regulation of Hec1 by Nek2 and Aurora B is critical for its mitotic
function and cell survival (10–12). The primary functions of Hec1
are assigned to mitotic control for kinetochore assembly, K-fiber
attachment, chromosome alignment, and the retaining of Mad2
spindle checkpoint protein to inhibit premature anaphase entry (9).
Interestingly, overexpression of Hec1 was previously observed in a
variety of human cancers and a large portion of the NCI-60 cancer
lines (13),4 which was later found to be an excellent prognosis
marker for primary breast cancers and patients with multiple
cancers (14, 15). Targeting Hec1 by virus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) has proved to be effective in tumor retardation
in animals (16, 17). Therefore, Hec1 emerges as a potential mitotic
target for cancer intervention.
In this study, we undertook a novel approach to targeting Hec1
by screening for inhibitory small compounds. Eight positive hits
were identified from a compound library. One of the lead
compounds, N-(4-[2,4-dimethyl-phenyl]-thiazol-2-yl)-benzamide
(INH1), showed promising cancer inhibition activity in cells and
in a tumor xenograft model in part by impairing the Hec1 function.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, antibodies, and cell lines. Compound library was
purchased from Nanosyn. INH1 and N-(4-[2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl]-thiazol2-yl)-2,4-dimethoxybenzamide (INH2) were further synthesized at the
University of California at Irvine. Other chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Antibody sources were mouse anti-Hec1 (Genetex), goat or
rabbit anti-Nek2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), human anti-ACA (Antibodies,
Inc.), and tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Human breast cancer cell
lines were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum.
MCF10A cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (50:50) plus 5% horse serum,
0.1 Ag/mL cholera toxin, 10 Ag/mL insulin, 0.5 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, and
20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor.
Reverse yeast two-hybrid screening. The fusion protein (TetR-Hec1) of
tet repressor fused to Hec1 COOH-terminal region (amino acids 250–618)
was constructed with the backbone of the pCWX200 plasmid and expressed
constitutively in yeast, whereas the expression of activation domain-Nek2
(AD-Nek2; catalytic domain deleted) fusion from pB42AD plasmid was

galactose inducible under GAL1 promoter. Yeasts were first grown in
glucose-containing medium and then inoculated ( final A600 at 0.05) into the
galactose medium containing 0.09% 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). The assay
was performed on 96-well plates with 10 Amol/L of one compound per well.
Yeast growth was used as the readout for a positive hit (18).
Binding assays. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) assays were performed
at 22.5jC in HBSD buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1%
DMSO (pH 7.5)] on Biacore 3000. 6His-Hec1 and GST-Nek2 were purified
as described before (10). NTA sensor chip or glutathione-modified CM5 chip
were used to capture His-Hec1 and GST-Nek2, respectively. The capture
level was about 140 to 180 resonance units (RU) at the flow rate of 5 AL/min.
For the binding assay, chips were sequentially treated with compounds (1 or
20 Amol/L) and then proteins (50 Ag/mL). Retained RUs were recorded and
processed (triplicate experiments). Coimmunoprecipitation and Western
blotting were done as described previously (19).
Microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Immunostaining, image processing, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
assays were done as detailed previously (20, 21).
Cytotoxicity and clonogenic survival assay. Standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays with a 3-d drug
treatment procedure were performed to measure the dose-dependent
cytotoxicity of INH1 in cultured cells. Triplicate sets were measured and
compiled for final data presentation. For clonogenic survival assay, 1,000 to
3,000 cells were seeded in a 10-cm Petri dish (triplicates) for 24 h and then
treated with DMSO or INH1 (10 Amol/L) for 12 d. Cells were refed once
every 3 d and then fixed and stained with 2% methylene blue in 50% (v/v)
methanol. Viable percentages were calculated for plotting survival curve to
derive compound GI50 (drug dose resulting in 50% of growth inhibition).
Colonies with at least 50 cells were scored.
Xenografted nude mice breast cancer model. Athymic female BALB/c
nude mice (nu/nu, 6–8 wk old) were purchased from Harlan Sprague
Dawley, Inc. Exponentially growing MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells
(5  106) were suspended in 100 AL of PBS and injected into the mammary

fat pad of each mouse. After 10 d of tumor implantation, mice were injected
(i.p., every other day/25 cycles in total) with vehicle A (15% DMSO, 20%
Tween 20, 10% PEG-400, 55% saline) or INH1 formulated in vehicle A (50 or
100 mg/kg body weight). Tumor size was measured twice weekly by using a
caliper, and the volume (mm3) was calculated using the formula V = L 
W 2/2, where L and W are the length and width of the tumor, respectively.
P values were derived from the ANOVA test (SigmaPlot). Mice were weighed
twice weekly. Mice work was performed under the guidelines of the
University of California at Irvine Animal Research Committee.

Results
Identification of Hec1 inhibitors. Hec1 has no known
enzymatic activity, thus precluding conventional screening for a
potential Hec1 ‘‘enzymatic inhibitor.’’ Nonetheless, Hec1 is known
to physically interact with Nek2 and such interaction plays a
significant role in cell survival (10, 22). This provides us a platform
for identifying small compounds capable of disrupting the two
binding partners by targeting either Hec1 or Nek2. Of interest is
Nek2, also a G2-M kinase important for mitotic control (23, 24),
overexpression of which was documented in various human
cancers (25–27). Like Hec1, Nek2 is also thought to be a prospective
anticancer target due to its mitotic-specific function (24, 25).
Therefore, compounds inhibiting the Hec1/Nek2 interaction may
be suitable for targeting either Hec1 or Nek2.
To search for such compounds, we adapted an inducible reverse
yeast two-hybrid screening method that allows yeast growth when
the candidate compound abolishes the interaction between the
Hec1- and Nek2-derived probes: TetR-Hec1 and AD-Nek2 fusion
proteins, respectively (Fig. 1A; refs. 18, 28). When not inhibited, the
two probes assume normal binding, resulting in URA3 (encoding
orotidine 5-phosphate decarboxylase) transactivation and subsequent production of toxic metabolite 5-fluorouracil from the
medium-supplemented component 5-FOA. We screened a library of
f24,000 compounds and identified eight positive hits, two of
which were selected due to the similar chemical scaffolds (named
INH1 and INH2 for inhibitor of Nek2/Hec1; Fig. 1B). In a similar
screening system with a control interacting pair (Rad51 and BRC
repeat), INH1 and INH2 were inactive (data not shown), confirming
the targeting specificity of INH1 and INH2 on Hec1/Nek2. INH1
and INH2 share a phenyl thiazolyl benzamide scaffold, but INH2
possesses one extra methyl group and two methoxyl groups
(Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1). In this study, we chose to focus on
INH1 because both seemed to be very similar in cell killing assay.
Hec1 or Nek2 can be the direct target of INH compounds
inhibiting the interaction between Hec1 and Nek2. To determine
the primary target, we used a SPR assay measuring a surfacebinding event (i.e., change of surface mass concentration at the
sensor chip; ref. 29). In principle, recombinant 6His-Hec1 and
GST-Nek2 were purified from bacteria. A sensor chip attached
with one of the purified proteins was preincubated with candidate compounds; then, the surface-binding event on adding the
partner protein was measured. If the compounds target the
immobilized protein, the partner will no longer stick to the chip
surface via protein-protein interaction (Fig. 2A), or otherwise it
will be retained (Fig. 2A). We found that, on the pretreatment of
INH1 or INH2, chip-immobilized Hec1 showed reduced ability to
bind to free Nek2 (39% and 55% reduction at 1 and 20 Amol/L,
respectively; Fig. 2B), whereas the compound pretreatment did not
affect the binding of immobilized Nek2 to free Hec1 (Fig. 2B).
These results indicate that INH compounds directly target Hec1
rather than Nek2.

Lanes 3 to 5, matrix-bound proteins were further competed with free INH1 of varying doses in the reaction. Resultant precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and detected for Hec1 or Nek2 by Western blotting. D, coimmunoprecipitation/Western blot assays with cells treated with DMSO (mock) or INH1 (25 Amol/L, 36 h).

To further test whether INH1 can bind to Hec1 from cells, we
adapted an affinity pull-down target verification system (30), in
which INH1 was conjugated to Affigel-10 matrix through a multistep synthesis (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2). Mixing the INH1
affinity matrix with the cell lysate brought down the endogenous
Hec1, in contrast to the control matrix (Fig. 2C). The binding is
specific because the matrix-bound Hec1 protein could be competed
out by INH1 but not mock solvent. Furthermore, the INH1 affinity
matrix did not bring down Nek2 (Fig. 2C), substantiating the notion
that INH1 binds to Hec1 but not Nek2.
Next, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay to test
whether INH1 treatment affects the cellular interaction between
Hec1 and Nek2. In the lysate prepared from cells treated with INH1
(25 Amol/L, 36 h), Hec1 failed to coimmunoprecipitate with Nek2,
indicating that the Hec1/Nek2 complex was disrupted (Fig. 2D).
Taken together, these results suggest that INH1 preferentially binds
to Hec1, leading to the disruption of Hec1/Nek2 interaction.
INH1 treatment resulted in reduced association of Hec1
with kinetochore and decrease of global Nek2 protein level.
To further address the consequence of cellular Hec1 and Nek2 after
treatment with INH1, we examined their protein levels by Western
blotting analysis. Little change of Hec1 was observed in a dosedependent kinetic study, although slight increase could be detected
in a time-dependent experiment (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, the overall
cellular Nek2 protein level was significantly reduced in both timeand dose-dependent fashions on INH1 treatment (80–90% decrease
24 h after INH1 treatment at 25 Amol/L). Nek2 down-regulation
was not due to G1-phase cell cycle arrest because there was no

www.aacrjournals.org

significant change of cyclin B level, neither was it dependent on
Hec1 expression, which remained steady after INH1 treatment
(Fig. 3A). Consistently, Nek2 expression level was unchanged on
depletion of Hec1 by two distinct Hec1 small interfering RNAs
(Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Nek2 reduction in INH1-treated
cells may be independent of Hec1.
Although the total Hec1 protein level was minimally affected by
INH1, we found that the kinetochore-bound Hec1 pool was reduced
by f55% (Fig. 3C and D) using quantitative microscopy with a
ratio-metric method (8, 21), suggesting defective Hec1 distribution
to its primary functional site, kinetochores. Taken together, these
results suggest that INH1 treatment led to disruption of the Hec1/
Nek2 complex, destabilization of Nek2, and defective localization
of Hec1 at kinetochores.
INH1 inhibits tumor cell proliferation in culture. Inactivation of cellular Hec1 or Nek2 by antagonists (RNAi or antibody)
is known to negatively affect mitosis and cell proliferation
(31–38). Defective Hec1 localization and reduced Nek2 level on
INH1 treatment may presumably give rise to mitotic defects and
thus hamper cancer cell growth. We are particularly interested in
testing breast cancer, in which overexpression of Hec1 or Nek2 is
linked to adverse clinical outcomes (14, 15, 25). To examine the
potential cell killing activity of INH1, a panel of human breast
cancer cell lines was treated with varying doses of INH1. All the
breast cancer cell lines showed evident sensitivity toward INH1
treatment (GI50 at 10–21 Amol/L; Fig. 4A). In contrast, MCF10A
was relatively resistant to similar treatment (GI50 at 41 Amol/L).

further confirmed the cell killing activity of INH1 toward at least
two breast cancer lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-468; Fig. 4B) as
well as the cervical adenocarcinoma line HeLa and the colon
cancer line HCT116 (data not shown). Taken together, these data
suggest that INH1 inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells in
culture.
INH1 treatment triggers a plethora of cellular phenotypes.
Hec1 or Nek2 inactivation by RNAi- or antibody-mediated depletion
is known to trigger cellular phenotypes characteristic of mitotic
abnormalities (31–40). To test whether INH1 treatment generates
similar cellular phenotypes, we used HeLa cells (GI50INH1, f10 Amol/L)
to perform cell biological studies because they were used extensively
for Hec1 cell biology (31, 32, 34, 39). Interestingly, the mitotic index
was found to increase by f2-fold, from 6% in control to 11% in

INH1-treated cells for 8 h after drug addition (Fig. 5A). Cells
underwent progressive morphologic changes, including features of
cell death, evident after 36 to 48 h (Fig. 5A, c–e). By the 72-h time
point, a significant portion of cells were dead, showing condensed
globular nuclear structures (Fig. 5A, e and g ). No major cell cycle
arrest was detected, except a slight G2-M increase at a low INH1 dose
(5 Amol/L; Fig. 5B, middle), reflective of a transient mitotic arrest.
Nonetheless, cell death was apparent, indicated by the increased
sub-G1 populations (Fig. 5B). Approximately 26% of the cells were
apoptotic at 72 h (10 Amol/L dose) compared with 2.6% in the mocktreated group. These results suggest that INH1 treatment elicits
transient mitotic arrest followed by eventual cell death, reminiscent
of the cell death phenotypes reported for HeLa cells partially or
completely depleted of Hec1 (32, 34).

D, immunofluorescent staining with anti-a-tubulin and g-tubulin to show the normal (row a; arrows ) and abnormal (rows b and c ; arrows ) spindle morphology.
Scale bar, 10 Am.

Chromosomal and spindle abnormalities are common to cells
defective in Hec1 or Nek2 (31, 32, 39, 41). Consistently, using live
cell microcopy with a HeLa subline stably expressing H2B-GFP,
chromosomal misalignment or lagging was readily observed on
INH1 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). The mitotic population
with chromosomal misalignment increased over time (Fig. 5C).
INH2 treatment also triggered a similar phenotype, albeit to a less
severe extent (Fig. 5C). Aberrant spindles, such as deformed or
multipolar spindles, were manifest (20–25% on INH1 treatment
versus 8% in control; Fig. 5D ). The drug-induced mitotic
abnormalities are similar to those observed in Hec1- or Nek2depleted cells, suggesting that INH1 treatment may impair the
Hec1/Nek2 function for spindle and chromosome regulation.
Hec1 was reported to retain Mad2 checkpoint protein on
kinetochores to prevent premature mitotic exit (31, 32). Immunostaining experiments suggest that Mad2 recruitment on kinetochores was not affected by INH1 (data not shown), probably due to
incomplete Hec1 inhibition (31, 32, 40). Nonetheless, a kinetic study
suggests that the spindle checkpoint maintenance was weakened
compared with the control (Supplementary. Fig. S4), which eventually led to mitotic slippage, consistent with our live cell microscopic study of H2B-GFP–expressing HeLa stable clones. Spindle
checkpoint activation and subsequent mitotic slippage are known
prerequisites of drug-induced mitotic catastrophe (5, 42). Thus,

www.aacrjournals.org

INH1-treated cells had positive spindle checkpoint response, but
the mitotic slippage eventually prevailed followed by cell death
(Fig. 5B). Notably, a similar observation has been reported for a
KSP/Eg5 inhibitor (5). Taken together, our results suggest that
INH1 treatment elicits cell killing activity in part through impairing
the Hec1/Nek2 pathway for the spindle checkpoint regulation.
INH1 inhibits tumor outgrowth in a xenografted breast
cancer model in nude mice. To examine the antitumor efficacy of
INH1, we tested the tumor inhibition activity in a nude mouse
model harboring tumor xenografts derived from human breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB-468, which were inoculated to the mammary fat pad to allow tumor outgrowth. Ten days later, INH1 was
administered into the mice i.p. at various doses (0, 50, and
100 mg/kg body weight) every other day for a total of 25 cycles.
Tumor sizes were measured over time. Remarkably, at both 50 and
100 mg/kg doses, INH1-treated mice showed significant tumor
growth retardation (Fig. 6A). The side effects were minimal, if any,
as indicated by the comparable body weight (Fig. 6B) and the autopsy (data not shown) between different groups. This study indicates that INH1 is effective in inhibiting tumor growth in animals.

Discussion
In this communication, we have identified a lead compound that
specifically disrupts the Hec1/Nek2 interaction by directly binding

to Hec1. INH1 treatment resulted in defective Hec1 localization on
kinetochores and significant Nek2 reduction, correlating with
mitotic abnormalities and cell death. The INH1-targeting effects
are in part reminiscent of Hec1 or Nek2 depletion mediated by
RNAi, suggesting that INH1 treatment impairs the Hec1/Nek2
function in cells. Although the off-target effects of INH1 cannot be
excluded, the resulted mitotic phenotypes strongly support that
the Hec1/Nek2 pathway is a major cellular target of INH1.
Structural similarities of INH1 and INH2 underlie a common
mechanism of action, wherein the INH compounds target a site
within the Hec1 COOH-terminal region critical for the Hec1/Nek2
interaction. The crystal structure of the Hec1 COOH-terminal
region, however, remains to be resolved, precluding lead optimization via structure-based approaches. Instead, we have adopted a
ligand-based strategy to test the structure-activity relationship.
Based on the activity of over 20 INH analogues synthesized to date
(data not shown), it seems that both the amide and two distant
phenyl rings are essential because modifying the amide or one of
the phenyl rings significantly affects the activity. For instance, the
amide hydrogen can be replaced by methyl or bulky acyl groups
without significant loss of activity (data not shown), suggesting
that this domain of the molecule may be accessible to the solvent
and thus can be used for installing a ‘‘linker,’’ as was done for the
INH1 affinity matrix. To this end, we have not been able to identify

an INH1 derivative serviceable as a true ‘‘negative’’ control. Notably,
for human cells, the GI50s of INH1 are at a similar micromolar level
to other known protein-protein interaction inhibitors such as those
for androgen receptor, interleukin-2, and BCL-2 (43, 44).
How is the Hec1/Nek2 pathway impaired? There are several
possibilities. First, INH1 binding may trigger Hec1 conformational
changes leading to impaired networking with other mitotic
regulators. The region of Hec1 responsible for Nek2 interaction
also binds to several important mitotic regulators, including Nuf2,
Zwint-1, and Hice1 (21, 22, 45, 46). Our preliminary study suggests
that the INH1 binding with Hec1 enhances, unlike the case of Nek2,
the Hec1/Nuf2 interaction (data not shown). On the other hand,
Hec1 is a substrate of Nek2. When the Hec1/Nek2 interaction is
abolished, Hec1 may not be properly phosphorylated and hence
become defective. Compound targeting effects eventually manifest
themselves through defective Hec1 targeting/recruitment on
kinetochores, its major functional sites.
Remarkably, INH1 treatment triggered dramatic reduction of
Nek2 in cells but not endogenous Hec1. This seemingly paradoxical
observation can be in part explained by indirect drug effects of
unknown nature or that INH1-bound Hec1 may gain a dominantnegative function that somehow triggers Nek2 degradation. Clearly,
loss of Nek2 was another important contributing factor to the cell
killing effects of INH1. Nek2A, one of the major Nek2 splice
variants, was reported to be degraded in an APC/C-dependent
manner starting at prometaphase (47). However, whether INH1
treatment may facilitate Nek2 degradation through the APC/C
pathway remains to be addressed. Although the precise molecular
mechanism remains to be explored, our results support that INH1
treatment may alter the overall Hec1/Nek2 network in ways that
promote mitotic errors, ultimately leading to mitotic catastrophe.
INH1 treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth in a
xenograft mouse model, although no apparent general toxicity
was observed. This may be attributed to the expeditious growth of
tumor cells compared with normal cells spared in part due to the
quiescence status or slower division. In the mean time, extensive
toxicology tests remain to be performed to fully address the
potential organismal toxicity. Nonetheless, our results clearly
indicate that the INH1-mediated Hec1 impairment, but not
complete shutdown, may effectively render cancer cells sensitive
to mitotic or genotoxic stress while sparing the surrounding
normal cells, consistent with tumor therapy studies involving Hec1
RNAi (16, 17). In essence, our study provides a proof of principle
that inhibiting the Hec1/Nek2 pathway by small molecules may
serve as an effective approach for cancer intervention.

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
W-H. Lee and J. Lau are cofounders of Taivex, a company that plans to further
develop INH compounds for potential clinical applications. However, none of the work
described in this study is supported by the company. The other authors disclosed no
potential conflict of interest.

A, changes of the tumor volumes following the INH1 treatment. MDA-MB-468
cells were injected into athymic nude mice under the mammary fat pad 10 d
before drug treatment; then, these tumor-bearing nude mice (n = 7 mice
for each group) were treated with control vehicle and 50 or 100 mg/kg
(body weight) of INH1 every other day for 7 wk (i.p. injection, 25 cycles).
Tumor volumes were measured over time and plotted in the graph. The P values
were derived from the ANOVA test. B, histogram showing the body weight
of the mice treated in A .
