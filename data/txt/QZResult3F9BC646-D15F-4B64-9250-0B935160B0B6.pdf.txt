Inhibition of Autophagy Enhances Anticancer Effects of
Atorvastatin in Digestive Malignancies
Pei-Ming Yang1, Yuan-Ling Liu1, Yi-Chu Lin1, Chia-Tung Shun2, Ming-Shiang Wu3, and Ching-Chow Chen1

Abstract
Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that statins, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl–CoA reductase inhibitors with cholesterol-lowering properties, exhibited anticancer effects. However, the underlying mechanisms remain ill defined. In this study, we showed that atorvastatin could inhibit the growth of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells via induction of apoptosis. Atorvastatin
also induced autophagy that is a physiologic process involved in the turnover of intracellular organelles.
Atorvastatin-induced autophagy was found to be inhibited by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) small
interfering RNA. Examination of HCC patients showed the positive correlation between AMPK activity and
autophagic marker (beclin-1). Atorvastatin-induced AMPK activation could induce p21 expression, which was
also positively correlated with beclin-1 expression in CRC patients. AMPK/p21 signaling caused endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress response leading to the induction of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by an autophagic
inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or genetic knockout of autophagy-related gene 5 enhanced atorvastatin-induced
cytotoxicity and apoptosis. In summary, activation of AMPK by atorvastatin enhances p21 expression and
ER stress response, leading to autophagy, which promotes survival of cancer cells. Combinations of atorvastatin
with bafilomycin A1 provide a novel and promising strategy to improve the treatment of digestive malignancies.

Introduction
Statins, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)–CoA reductase inhibitors, are among the most widely prescribed
drugs to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular diseases (1, 2). By depleting precursors of the mevalonate
pathway and its various downstream products with essential roles in cell cycle progression, cellular signaling, and
membrane integrity, statins may affect various cellular
events and impair homeostasis. In vitro studies reveal that
statins can inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, or inhibit angiogenesis, highlighting their potential anticancer effects (1, 2). Accordingly, some observational studies screen
the effect of statins on the incidence of various cancers as
part of the controlled trials on cardiovascular outcomes.
Among them, a consistent association of decreased risk is
found for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal

carcinoma (CRC; refs. 3–6). Furthermore, experimental data
have unveiled a beneficial effect of statins on these two important malignancies. Of special interest is that the combination of statins with other anticancer drugs can enhance
in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of HCC, which is
characterized by chemoresistance (7). Collectively, statins
may play a dual crucial role as a lipid-lowering drug for
the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and as an anticancer agent to prevent certain cancers.
Despite supporting epidemiologic evidence as well as experimental data, controversy exists about whether statins
can indeed prevent cancer. There are epidemiologic studies
showing the contrary: that statin use could lead to increased
risk of cancer (8, 9). Several likely explanations might account for the disparity. These include insufficient control
for potential confounders associated with exposure and outcome, inadequate power to detect cancer outcomes, and
short follow-ups (10). Given the increasing prevalence of
statin use and the controversial observational reports of its
effect on cancers, further laboratory investigation should be
conducted to better define the mechanisms by which statins
show anticancer or cancer-promoting effects.
Autophagy is a physiologic process involved in the turnover
of proteins or intracellular organelles and serves as a temporary
survival mechanism during starvation, wherein self-digestion
becomes an alternative energy source (11). Defective autophagy
has been linked to a number of human pathologies, including
cancer (12). It is noteworthy that the anticancer effect of statins
could act through the mevalonate-independent pathway.
Specifically, our group has found that statins induced p21

expression through inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC)
activity and dissociation of HDAC1/2 from the promoter (13).
To further address the biological mechanisms underlying the
anticancer effect of statins, we used HCC and CRC as models.
In the present study, we showed that atorvastatin inhibited
tumor growth via induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.
Atorvastatin also induced autophagy, which was dependent
on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, then led
to p21 expression, and resulted in endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress response. Inhibition of autophagy enhanced
atorvastatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Our results
provide the molecular clues that the combination of autophagic inhibitors and statins may enhance efficacy of digestive
malignances therapy.

ing of HCT116 p53−/−, p21−/−, and MEF Atg5−/− cells was
authenticated by RNase protection assay or immunoblot
analysis within the last 3 months.
Transient transfection
The plasmids (EGFP-LC3, EGFP-p21, and EGFP-p21-NLSA)
or small interfering RNA (siRNA; AMPK and PERK) were
transiently transfected into cells with Lipofectamine 2000
transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 24 hours, the cells were treated with
atorvastatin for 24 hours and subjected to fluorescent analysis or Western blotting assay.
Transmission electron microscopy
Cell were fixed in a solution containing 8% paraformaldehyde, 5% glutaraldehyde, 1% tannic acid, and 30 mmol/L
sodium cacodylate for 1 hour. The fixed cells were suspended in a buffered solution containing 1% osmic acid
for 1 hour, followed by dehydration in a graded ethanol
series, washing with acetone, and embedding into EPON
epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (60–80 nm) were prepared

Autophagy Inhibition Enhances Atorvastatin's Effects

Animal xenograft model
Female BALB/c nude mice (4–6 weeks old) were injected
with 2 × 106 Huh7 cells (suspended in 0.1 mL PBS and mixed
with 0.1 mL Matrigel) in the rear left flank. After 2 weeks,
animals were divided into two groups and p.o. received either
control vehicle (soy oil) or atorvastatin (50 mg/kg/d) for
21 days. Tumor volume was measured twice per week with
calipers and calculated using the formula, V (mm3) = 0.52*
[ab2], wherein a is the length and b is the width of the tumor.
Histopathologic evaluation
Formalin-fixed colonic tissues from mice were embedded
in paraffin by routine procedures. H&E-stained, 4-μm sections of major organs were evaluated microscopically by a
pathologist. The expression of relevant biomarkers in representative sections of tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining using specific primary antibodies.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using Student's t test. P values of <0.05
were considered significant. The correlation between phosphorylated AMPK or p21 and beclin-1 expression in normal
and tumor tissues was evaluated by the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. The calculated formula was rs = 1 − [6Σdi2]/
[n(n2 − 1)], wherein di was the difference in the ranks given to
the paired samples and n was the paired sample numbers.

Results
Atorvastatin exhibited anticancer effects in vitro
and in vivo
To investigate the anticancer potential of statins, HCC
cells (Huh7), and CRC cells (HCT116) were treated with
atorvastatin, and cell proliferation was examined by MTT
assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, atorvastatin inhibited cell
growth of both cells. To further characterize atorvastatininduced cytotoxicity, apoptotic cell death was assessed by
Annexin V/PI double staining and sub-G1 analysis. Increase
of apoptosis in early stage (Annexin V positive/PI negative)
and late stage (Annexin V positive/PI positive) was detected
in atorvastatin-treated Huh7 cells (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1). Similarly, atorvastatin induced apoptosis in
HCT116 cells, as indicated by an increase in sub-G1 phase
(Fig. 1B). Apoptotic induction by atorvastatin in both cells
was further confirmed by the time- and dose-dependent decrease of procaspase-3 and the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 1C).
These results suggested that atorvastatin might exhibit anticancer effects through the induction of apoptosis.
To investigate whether atorvastatin inhibited tumor
growth in vivo, the nude mice bearing Huh7 tumor xenografts were given p.o. atorvastatin (50 mg/kg/d) or vehicle
for 32 days. Tumor growth was significantly reduced by atorvastatin, and liver metastasis was not observed (Fig. 1D). Intriguingly, the transmission electron microscopic analysis of
excised tumor tissues showed the double-membrane and
autophagosome-like structures in atorvastatin-treated tumor
cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the cells underwent autophagy.
Western blot analysis indicated that atorvastatin simulta-

neously induced apoptosis and autophagy, which were respectively characterized by PARP cleavage and beclin-1
(Atg6) expression (Fig. 1F).
Atorvastatin induced autophagy in vitro
Because atorvastatin induced autophagy in vivo, whether
this event occurred in vitro was further investigated. Huh7
and HCT116 cells were treated with atorvastatin, and morphologic changes were examined by transmission electron
microscopy. Compared with cells in the basal state, atorvastatin-treated Huh7 and HCT116 cells exhibited obvious autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). To confirm
this, a green fluorescent EGFP-LC3 plasmid was transfected
into Huh7 and HCT116 cells. Microtubule-associated LC3
protein is used as a biomarker of autophagy. This protein
normally exhibits diffused cytosolic distribution but is processed and localized to autophagosomes during autophagy
(15). As shown in Fig. 2B, diffused distribution of EGFP-LC3
in the basal state was observed in the whole cells. After
treatment with atorvastatin, punctuate patterns of EGFPLC3 representing autophagic vacuoles were formed in the
cytoplasm. This phenomenon was confirmed by immunoblot analysis to detect LC3 conversion from the cytosolic
16-kDa LC3-I to the autophagosome-associated 18-kDa
LC3-II. Because LC3-II tends to be more sensitive than
LC3-I in immunoblotting, simple comparison of LC3-I and
LC3-II for ratio determinations might not be appropriate
(16). Therefore, we compared the amount of LC3-II between
samples. The accumulation of LC3-II was induced by atorvastatin in Huh7, Hep3B, HepG2, and HCT116 cells (Fig. 2C).
Moreover, atorvastatin-induced LC3-II accumulation was
blocked in Atg5 knockout MEF cells (Fig. 2D). These results
suggested that atorvastatin induced autophagy of cancer
cells in vitro.
To examine whether inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
was involved in the atorvastatin-induced autophagy, Huh7
and HCT116 cells were given with mevalonate. Replenishment of mevalonate did not affect atorvastatin-induced
LC3-II accumulation (Fig. 2E). In addition, various statins including lovastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin
were able to induce LC3-II accumulation (Fig. 2F). These results suggested that statin-induced autophagy was independent of HMG-CoA reductase activity.
Inhibition of autophagy potentiated the anticancer
effects of atorvastatin
To investigate the role of autophagy in the anticancer effects of atorvastatin, wt and Atg5 knockout (Atg5−/−) MEF
cells were treated with atorvastatin, and then cell viability
was analyzed. As show in Fig. 3A, atorvastatin induced
growth inhibition in wt MEF cells, and inhibition was enhanced in Atg5−/− cells. This event correlated with the increase of procaspase-3 and PARP cleavage in Atg5−/− cells
(Fig. 3B). An inhibitor of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase, bafilomycin A1, which blocks the fusion of autophagosome and
lysosome, enhanced atorvastatin-induced cytotoxicity in
Huh7 cells (Fig. 3C). Cotreatment of bafilomycin A1 with
atorvastatin also enhanced the procaspase-3 and PARP

cleavage (Fig. 3D). Similarly, atorvastatin-induced apoptosis,
caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage in HCT116 cells
were augmented in the presence of bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 3E
and F). To examine the potentiation of bafilomycin A1
on the in vivo anticancer effect of atorvastatin, the nude
mice bearing Huh7 tumor xenografts were given atorvastatin p.o. (20 mg/kg/d) and were s.c. injected with bafilomycin A1 (1 mg/kg/d). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2,
enhancement of bafilomycin A1 on in vivo anticancer effect
of atorvastatin was observed. Therefore, atorvastatininduced autophagy might be an adaptive response that
promoted cell survival.

Atorvastatin induced autophagy through
AMPK activation
AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates energy
balance and serves as an energy sensor in all eukaryotic cells
(17). Once activated, AMPK promotes energy production and
limits energy utilization to ensure cellular survival (18). AMPK
activation has been reported to induce autophagy through
phosphorylating and activating the TSC1/TSC2 complex that
negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex
(19). We found that atorvastatin induced AMPK activation in
Huh7 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 4A). To ascertain whether AMPK
was required for atorvastatin-induced autophagy, Huh7 and

HCT116 cells were transfected with AMPK siRNA. Western
blot analysis showed that atorvastatin-induced LC3-II accumulation was inhibited when AMPK expression was knocked
down (Fig. 4B), showing that atorvastatin induced autophagy
through activation of AMPK. Furthermore, the expression
of beclin-1 and AMPK activity was examined in the HCC
patients. Examination of 11 patients showed that the expression of beclin-1 and phosphorylated AMPK was elevated in tumor tissues compared with the adjacent normal
tissues. Activated AMPK was positively correlated with
the beclin-1 expression in patients (Fig. 4C; Supplementary
Fig. S3). Therefore, targeting AMPK-mediated autophagy
would be an effective strategy to enhance the efficacy of
therapy for HCC.
Atorvastatin induced autophagy through
cytoplasmic p21
The tumor suppressor protein p53 acts as a transcription
factor that transactivates proapoptotic and cell cycle arrest-

7704

ing genes (20). p53 can also transactivate an autophagyinducing gene, DRAM, which encodes a lysosomal protein
(21). However, cytoplasmic p53 exerts autophagy-inhibitory
function, and its degradation is actually required for the induction of autophagy (22). The p53 downstream gene p21 is a
universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) belonging to the CIP/KIP family of CDK inhibitors (23). Accumulating evidence indicates that p21 has other functions, for
example, inducing apoptosis or enhancing the apoptotic response to chemotherapeutic agents (24–26). We previously
found that statins induced p53-independent p21 expression
(13); therefore, the roles of p53 and p21 in atorvastatininduced autophagy were investigated using HCT116 wt,
p53−/−, and p21−/− cells. Atorvastatin-induced LC3-II accumulation or autophagosome formation was seen in HCT116 wt
and p53−/−, but not in p21−/− cells (Fig. 5A and B), indicating the independence of p53 and dependence on p21 in
atorvastatin-induced autophagy. Although atorvastatin
induced both cytoplasmic and nuclear p21 expression,

the LC3-II was predominantly located in the cytoplasm
(Fig. 5C), implying that cytoplasmic p21 might play a more
important role in autophagic induction. To clarify this, wt
and NLSA (mutation of Ser to Ala on nuclear localization
sequence) p21 were transfected into HCT116 p21−/− cells,
and their distributions were examined by Western blot
and immunofluorescence analysis. wt p21 was found in
both nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas NLSA p21 was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5D). Overexpression of wt or NLSA p21 both increased LC3-II accumulation
(Fig. 5E), suggesting that cytoplasmic p21 was sufficient to induce autophagy. To examine the effect of p21 on atorvastatininduced apoptosis, HCT116 p21−/− cells, reconstituted with
wt or NLSA p21, were treated with atorvastatin. PARP
cleavage induced by atorvastatin was reduced by NLSA
p21 (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, the expression of p21 and
beclin-1 was also examined in normal and tumor colon
tissues. Examination of 30 CRC patients showed that the
expressions of p21 and beclin-1 were positively correlated
(Fig. 5G; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Atorvastatin induced autophagy through p21-mediated
ER stress response
ER is an organelle in eukaryotic cells playing an important
role as a sensor for cellular stress by detecting the changes in
cell homeostasis and by responding to different signal path-

www.aacrjournals.org

ways (27). The hallmark of the ER stress response is the
activation of eIF2α protein kinase (PERK) to phosphorylate
eIF2α and then induce expression of a transcription factor
CCAAT/enhancer binding homologous protein (CHOP/
GADD153; ref. 28). To examine whether atorvastatininduced autophagy was associated with ER stress response,
phosphorylation of eIF2α was examined. Atorvastatin induced phosphorylation of eIF2α in Huh7 and HCT116 cells
(Fig. 6A and B). A chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate,
which is an ER stress inhibitor, inhibited atorvastatininduced phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 6B). Moreover,
knockdown of PERK expression inhibited atorvastatininduced eIF2α phosphorylation and LC3-II accumulation
in HCT116 cells, suggesting that atorvastatin induces autophagy through ER stress response (Fig. 6C).
To dissect the molecular interactions of AMPK activation,
cytoplasmic p21, and ER stress response in the regulation of
autophagy, AMPK siRNA was transfected to HCT116 cells,
and then the phosphorylated eIF2α and expression of
GADD153 and p21 were analyzed. Atorvastatin-induced
phosphorylation of eIF2α and expression of GADD153 as
well as p21 were diminished, suggesting that atorvastatininduced p21 expression and ER stress are dependent on
AMPK activity (Fig. 6D). In addition, atorvastatin-induced
phosphorylation of eIF2α and expression of GADD153 were
not seen in HCT116 p21−/− cells (Fig. 6E), suggesting that

p21 acts upstream of ER stress. Indeed, overexpression of
wt and NLSA p21 to HCT116 wt and p21−/− cells increased
the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the expression of
GADD153 (Fig. 6F). Therefore, atorvastatin induced autophagy through AMPK activation, which led to p21 expression, and then caused ER stress response.

Discussion
In epidemiologic observations, statins use was associated
with the decreased risk of HCC and CRC, but the underlying mechanisms remained ill defined. Given the chemoresistant nature of HCC and high prevalence of CRC, we thus

Autophagy Inhibition Enhances Atorvastatin's Effects

investigated how statins can have anticancer effects for
these two fatal malignancies. Our results indicated that
atorvastatin exhibited antitumor activities in cancer cells
of HCC (Huh7) and CRC (HCT116) through induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, autophagy was induced in both cells,
as well as in atorvastatin-induced Huh7 xenograft tumors.
Intriguingly, inhibition of autophagy increased cellular sensitivity to atorvastatin in vitro and in vivo. Taken together,
our results not only elucidated the detailed mechanisms of
anticancer effects of statins but also provided novel insights
that combination of autophagic inhibitors and statins might
be an attractive and promising strategy for the management of HCC and CRC.
Previous studies have reported that either blockage of autophagy or induction of autophagy could lead to tumor
growth (12). The effect of manipulated autophagy seems to
vary with intrinsic properties of the tumor and with the nature of combined therapy. Our finding that statins induced
autophagy might provide a plausible explanation for the
varying relationships of statins and cancer in different tissues
(10). In this study, genetic inhibition of AMPK was found to

reduce atorvastatin-induced autophagy, and examination of
HCC patients showed the positive correlation between the
expression of beclin-1 and phosphorylated AMPK in tumor
tissues. This finding as well as in vitro and in vivo hepatoma
models indicated that autophagy might promote survival of
liver cancer cells. This was further supported by the result
that inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 indeed enhanced atorvastatin-induced apoptosis and anticancer effect
in vivo. In this aspect, our observations were consistent with
the studies using different cancer cells and agents. One study
revealed that inhibition of AMPK can overcome drug resistance and sensitize human prostate cancer DU145 cells to
Fas-induced apoptosis (29). The chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin activates AMPK in various cancer cells, and inhibition of
AMPK results in a marked augmentation of cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (30). Because atorvastatin induced autophagy
through AMPK activation, combination with AMPK or autophagy inhibitors would enhance the therapeutic effect on cancer therapy.
Genetic inhibition of AMPK was found to reduce atorvastatin-induced p21 expression, indicating that AMPK acts

upstream of p21 expression. Activation of AMPK by the widely used AMP-mimetic 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) also showed induction of p21 expression
(31). The mechanism for AICAR-induced p21 expression involves accumulation of p53 through phosphorylation of Ser15
(31). However, our previous studies showed that atorvastatininduced p21 expression was independent of p53 because the
p21 promoter activity was not affected by the deletion of p53
(13). Moreover, statins were shown to induce p21 expression
through inhibition of HDAC activity (13). Therefore, AMPK
might regulate p21 expression through modulation of HDAC
activity. The posttranslational modification of HDAC is crucial for its enzyme activity and localization. For example,
phosphorylation of HDAC1 at Ser421 and Ser423 by protein kinase CK2 regulates its deacetylase activity and capacity to
form protein complexes (32–34). Aligning the consensus motif of AMPK phosphorylation sites (X-I-X-R-X-X-S-X-X-X-V; X,
any amino acid; I, isoleucin; R, arginine; S, serine; V, valine;
ref. 35), Ser69 of HDAC1 and Ser70 of HDAC2 are found to be
the putative AMPK phosphorylation sites. In support of this
notion, we found that AMPK was activated and translocated
to the nucleus on statin stimulation and AMPK can phosphorylate pure HDAC2 protein and GST-HDAC2 in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. S5). It is possible that phosphorylation
of HDAC2 by AMPK leads to inhibition of HDAC activity,
which is crucial for statin-induced p21 expression.
p53 exerts an ambiguous function in the regulation of autophagy. Within the nucleus, p53 acts as an autophagyinducing transcription factor. p53 in the cytoplasm exerts a
tonic autophagy-inhibitory function (36). We found that atorvastatin induced LC3-II accumulation in HCT116 p53−/− cells,
indicating the independence of p53 in atorvastatin-induced
autophagy. Interestingly, three lines of evidence showed that
the p53 downstream gene p21 promotes autophagy. First,
atorvastatin-induced autophagy was abolished in p21−/− cells.
Second, ectopic expression of wt or NLSA p21 induced autophagy in HCT116 wt and p21−/− cells. Third, examination of patients with CRC showed positive correlation of p21 and
beclin-1 expression. Although autophagy is activated by nutrient starvation (37), we showed a novel induction pathway indicating that accumulation of p21 in the cytoplasm leads to
autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions. Inhibition of cell
growth by p21 is strongly correlated with its nuclear localization (23, 38). However, recent lines of evidence have shown
that p21 can also localize in the cytoplasm and plays a protecting role against apoptosis (39, 40). Both nuclear p21 and
cytosolic p21 were induced by atorvastatin. The localization

of p21 is important for the regulation of autophagy. Because
autophagy occurs in the cytoplasm, only cytoplasmic p21 is
expected to play a role in this event. This was shown by the
result that overexpression of p21 with mutation of Ser to Ala
in nuclear localization sequence still induced autophagy.
Therefore, accumulation and redistribution of p21 in the cytoplasm might be important for atorvastatin-induced autophagy. Akt has been reported to phosphorylate p21 at Thr145
and retained it in the cytoplasm, leading to the loss of cell cycle
inhibition (40). Instead of cell cycle arrest, p21 in the cytoplasm induced an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. Cytoplasmic
p21 can form a complex with the apoptosis signal-regulating
kinase 1 and inhibits c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase–induced
apoptosis (39). It can also enter mitochondria and interacts
with procaspase-3 to inhibit its activation (41). Therefore,
cytoplasmic p21 itself might act as an inhibitor of apoptosis.
We further showed that p21-induced autophagy depends on
ER stress response. A recent report has shown that overexpression of p21 or p27 enhanced bile acid–induced phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α and increased the numbers of
autophagic vesicles in primary hepatocytes (42). These results
strengthen our findings that cytoplasmic p21 increases ER
stress and autophagy and plays an important role beyond cell
cycle regulation.
To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that
activation of AMPK by atorvastatin induced cytoplasmic
p21-dependent ER stress, which regulates autophagy. The
atorvastatin-induced autophagy leads to cell survival in
HCC and CRC cancer cells. The combination of autophagic
inhibitors enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Pharmacologic targeting of autophagy provides a promising strategy
for the management of HCC and CRC.
