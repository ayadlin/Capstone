BACKGROUND: The addition of chemoradiation (CRT) to surgery has been shown to improve survival in patients with esophageal
cancer. In the current study, the authors determined whether the sequencing of CRT has an effect on survival and cardiopulmonary
mortality in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: Patients with the following inclusion criteria were identified within 17 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries from 1988 through 2007: adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and having undergone esophagectomy. Patients who died within 90 days of surgery were excluded. Demographic, tumor, and
survival data were compared between patients receiving preoperative and postoperative RT. Cox proportional hazards regression
models were calculated to identify parameters associated with cause-specific survival and overall survival. A competing risk analysis
was performed to account for death due to esophageal cancer in the calculation of cardiopulmonary mortality. RESULTS: Of 5512
patients, 1881 received preoperative RT, 901 received postoperative RT, and 2730 did not receive RT. Patients receiving preoperative
RT had improved 5-year cause-specific survival (41% vs 31%; P < .0001) and overall survival (33% vs 23%; P < .0001) compared with
those receiving postoperative RT. No differences in adjusted cardiopulmonary mortality were found between patients who received
RT versus those who did not (8% vs 10% at 10 years; hazards ratio [HR], 0.84 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.64-1.12] [P ¼ .24])
or between those treated with preoperative RT versus those treated with postoperative RT (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.08 [P ¼ .11]).

INTRODUCTION
In patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, the addition of chemoradiation (CRT) to surgery has shown improvements in overall survival (OS) when given preoperatively.1-6 In the subset of patients with tumors of the gastroesophageal
junction, CRT delivered postoperatively has also demonstrated a survival benefit.7 To the best of our knowledge, no
randomized controlled trials currently exist that compare the outcomes of the sequencing of CRT in relation to surgery in
patients with esophageal cancer.
Preoperative CRT is preferred over postoperative treatment in patients with other gastrointestinal malignancies such
as rectal cancer, in whom preoperative CRT has been demonstrated to have a superior locoregional control rate, toxicity
profile, and survival rate.8,9 It is postulated that preoperative treatment is favored because of tumor downstaging and
smaller radiation treatment fields. We hypothesized that preoperative RT is associated with decreased cardiopulmonary
mortality from lower RT doses to the heart and lungs as well as improved survival outcomes compared with postoperative
RT in patients with esophageal cancer.
Using the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we assessed
differences in survival outcomes between patients treated with preoperative RT and those treated with postoperative RT
and analyzed the effect of RT on heart and lung morbidity as defined by cardiopulmonary mortality in 2 comparisons:
those patients receiving any RT versus those receiving no RT and those receiving preoperative versus postoperative RT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SEER Database and Queries

The SEER database is a national cancer surveillance program that collects information regarding the incidence
and survival of cancer cases. It has been extensively used
for survival and outcomes research in a variety of organ
sites.10-12 The SEER database was queried for patients
who were diagnosed with stage I to stage III (any T, any
N, M0) (according the seventh edition of the American
Joint Committee on Cancer) adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and underwent
esophagectomy between 1988 and 2007. Patients who
died within 90 days of surgery were excluded to limit the
confounding effect of perioperative mortality. Follow-up
was defined as the time from the diagnosis to date of death
or through December 31, 2009, whichever occurred first.
SEER*Stat statistical software (version 7.0.4) was used to
perform all queries.13
The following patient and tumor characteristics
were collected: age at diagnosis, sex, race, marital status,
median income of the patient’s county of residence, year
of diagnosis, histology, T classification, number of positive lymph nodes, and the total number of lymph nodes
examined. Patient characteristics were compared
between patients who received preoperative RT and
those receiving postoperative RT using the chi-square
test. The use of RT and sequencing of RT in relation to
esophagectomy (preoperative or postoperative) was
recorded. No data were available concerning the use of
chemotherapy.
Endpoints and Statistical Analyses

Kaplan-Meier curves (along with log-rank statistics) were
estimated to compare preoperative versus postoperative
RT on both OS and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Furthermore, a multivariable Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of radiation sequencing on both OS and CSS with adjustment for
age, sex, race, marital status, median income in the
patient’s county of residence, radiation sequence, T classification, lymph node status, total number of lymph nodes
examined, and tumor histology. Tumor staging was
derived by taking data regarding the available extent of
disease and lymph node status and recoding them as per
the American Joint Committee on Cancer guidelines
(seventh edition).14 Due to the nature of the SEER database, information regard the T and N classifications
reflects pathologic staging after surgery, and clinical staging at the time of the initial presentation was not available.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to address the effect

of unmeasured clinical staging as a potential confounder
on clinical outcomes.15,16
Cardiopulmonary mortality was defined as death
because of ‘‘diseases of the heart’’; ‘‘pneumonia and influenza’’; ‘‘other diseases of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries’’; ‘‘atherosclerosis’’; ‘‘lung and bronchus’’; and
‘‘chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions.’’ A competing risks analysis was performed in which
death due to esophageal cancer was considered as a competing risk for cardiopulmonary mortality.17 The analysis
was performed for 2 comparisons: 1) patients who
received RT at any time during their treatment of
esophageal cancer versus those who received no RT;
and 2) patients who received preoperative versus
postoperative RT.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
statistical software (version 11.1; (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Tex). Unless otherwise specified, all tests were 2sided with a P value < .05 considered to be statistically
significant. Sensitivity analyses were performed using R
statistical software (version 2.14; The R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics

The study cohort comprised 5512 patients diagnosed
with esophageal cancer and treated with esophagectomy
during the period from 1988 to 2007 (Table 1). The median age at the time of diagnosis was 63 years, with an
interquartile range of 56 years to 71 years. The median
survival was 28 months, with a median follow-up of 73
months. There was a strong predilection for male sex,
compromising 80% of patients in the analysis. Furthermore, approximately 86% of patients in the analysis were
white. More patients had histologically proven adenocarcinoma (67%) compared with squamous cell carcinoma
(33%); however, this percentage was not consistent over
the study period (Fig. 1A). There was a slight preponderance (58% vs 42%) of squamous cell carcinoma in
patients diagnosed in 1988. The percentage of patients
with adenocarcinoma increased over time; in patients
diagnosed in 2006, 76% had adenocarcinoma, with only
24% of patients found to have squamous cell carcinoma.
A total of 2782 patients (50%) received external
beam RT, with an approximate 2:1 ratio (1881 vs 901) of
patients receiving preoperative to postoperative RT.
There were statistically significant differences noted with
regard to race, tumor histology, T classification, lymph
node status, and number of lymph nodes examined
between patients treated with preoperative compared with

ever, because T and N classifications reflect pathologic
staging, the effect of preoperative RT on primary tumor
and lymph node downstaging must be taken into account
when interpreting these differences between T and N classifications. The percentage of patients receiving preoperative versus postoperative RT was 1:1 until 1998, at which
point significantly more patients began receiving preoperative RT (Fig. 1B). In the treatment era between 2001
and 2007, the ratio was 3:1 of patients receiving preoperative versus postoperative RT.

those treated with postoperative RT (Table 1). Approximately 90% of patients treated with preoperative RT were
white compared with 83% of the patients treated with
postoperative RT (P < .001). Adenocarcinomas comprised 69% of cases in the preoperative RT group versus
61% in the postoperative RT group (P < .001). T3 and
T4 tumors were more frequent in the patients receiving
postoperative RT compared with those treated with preoperative RT (76% vs 63%; P < .001). Likewise, positive
lymph nodes were more frequent in the patients treated
with postoperative RT (70% vs 46%; P < .001). How1978

Preoperative RT was associated with a statistically significantly increased overall survival compared with postoperative RT (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.85 [P < .0001]).
The median survival was 27 months versus 20 months,
the 5-year OS rate was 33% versus 23%, and the 10-year
OS rate was 22% versus 15% for preoperative and postoperative RT, respectively (Fig. 2A). Preoperative RT
remained statistically significantly associated with
improved OS after adjustment for covariates (HR, 0.88;
95% CI, 0.78-0.98 [P ¼ .029]) (Table 2). This also held
true across treatment eras with an HR of 0.81 (95% CI,

for the percentage of patients treated with preoperative
RT being clinically overstaged and 5% to 10% was used
for the patients treated with postoperative RT.18,19 In
addition, an assumption was made that the HR associated
with a lower clinical stage was between 0.60 and 0.80
(protective effect). Under plausible scenarios, the HR
adjusted for clinical stage remained similar to our original
estimate (HR, 0.88), falling within the range of 0.89 to
0.92.
Factors found to be associated with poor prognosis
on univariable analysis were T3/T4 tumor classification,
positive lymph node status, greater than 10 lymph nodes
examined, squamous cell carcinoma histology, age > 65
years, male sex, nonwhite race, unmarried status, and a
median county income of < $50,000 (Table 2). On multivariable analysis, tumor stage, lymph node status, number of lymph nodes examined, age, sex, and median
county income remained statistically significant whereas
marital status, race, and tumor histology were not found
to be statistically significant. Among the tumor characteristics, lymph node status and T classification were associated with a worse OS (HRs of 1.60 and 1.40,
respectively).

and 1998, and an HR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P ¼
.02) for patients treated after that period. CSS was also
found to be superior for preoperative RT compared with
postoperative RT, with a median CSS of 34 months versus 23 months, 5-year CSS rates of 39% versus 28%, and
10-year CSS rates of 33% versus 24% (HR, 0.75; 95%
CI, 0.67-0.83 [P < .0001) (Fig. 2B).
Because data were not available regarding pretreatment clinical tumor staging, the potential imbalance of
clinical T and N stage distribution between patients
treated with preoperative RT versus those treated with
postoperative RT (with the preoperative RT group having
a higher prevalence of clinically overstaged patients) may
have led to an overestimation of the estimated HR for preoperative RT versus postoperative RT. A sensitivity analysis was performed to account for unmeasured clinical
stage as a confounder on the estimated treatment effect

Cardiopulmonary mortality was compared in all patients
(n ¼ 5512) who were treated with surgery alone with
those who received RT (preoperative or postoperative)

death due to esophageal cancer. This analysis demonstrated no difference in the cohorts (HR, 0.84; 95% CI.

rates of cardiopulmonary mortality of 6% and 10%,
respectively, in the group receiving no RT and 5% and
8%, respectively, in the group who received RT (Fig. 3A).
Because it is conceivable that preoperative treatment
could negatively impact cardiopulmonary mortality immediately occurring after surgery, cardiopulmonary mortality was also compared when including patients who
died within 90 days of surgery (309 additional patients);
similarly, we found no significant difference: the 5-year
and 10-year estimated rates of cardiopulmonary mortality
were 7% and 10%, respectively, in the group receiving no
RT and 5% and 8%, respectively, in the group treated
with RT. Using multivariable competing risk regression
(Table 3), age > 65 years was found to be statistically significantly associated with poorer cardiopulmonary mortality, while being married and a having a negative lymph
node examination were associated with favorable cardiopulmonary mortality. A subgroup analysis of patients

aged < 65 years demonstrated no difference in cardiopulmonary mortality (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.71-1.41 [P ¼
.98]). To account for the potential effects of improved
surgical and RT techniques over time, we assessed whether
there were differences with regard to cardiopulmonary
mortality during different time eras in the current study.
Although a trend toward decreased cardiopulmonary
mortality over the study period was noted, the differences
were not statistically significant between treatment eras:
HR of 1.21 (95% CI, 0.92-1.58; P ¼ .18) for RT versus
no RT in 1988 through 1999 and HR of 0.99 (95% CI,
0.72-1.39 [P ¼ .99]) in 2000 through 2007.
Because our hypothesis was that preoperative RT
may lead to a decrease in cardiopulmonary toxicity and
subsequent cardiopulmonary mortality because of a
reduction in the normal tissue volumes being irradiated
(Fig. 4), we compared cardiopulmonary mortality
between patients treated with preoperative and postoperative RT using a similar competing risk model. No statistical difference in cardiopulmonary mortality was found for
patients who received preoperative RT versus postopera1980

tive RT on both univariable and multivariable analysis
(HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.08 [P ¼ .11]) (Table 3). The
5-year and 10-year rates of cardiopulmonary mortality
were 5% and 8%, respectively, for patients receiving preoperative RT versus 6% and 8%, respectively, for patients
receiving postoperative RT (Fig. 3B). A subgroup analysis
containing only patients aged < 65 years also indicated no
difference in cardiopulmonary mortality (HR, 1.05; 95%
CI, 0.63-1.76 [P ¼ .85]).
DISCUSSION
In our analysis of patients with esophageal cancer in the
SEER database who were treated with a combined modality treatment, we found that preoperative RT resulted in
superior OS and CSS compared with postoperative RT
without increasing cardiopulmonary mortality versus surgery alone. The benefits of preoperative RT over postoperative RT with regard to OS and CSS are both
statistically and clinically significant, with an approximately 10% absolute benefit noted at 5 years. These benefits were especially prominent in patients with T3/T4 or

lymph node-positive disease, suggesting that these
patients may benefit the most from a course of preoperative RT. Our finding that the use of RT, either preoperatively or postoperatively, does not significantly increase
cardiopulmonary mortality compared with surgery alone
is important when justifying the addition of a potentially
morbid treatment modality.
Preoperative RT has the theoretical advantages of
tumor downstaging and smaller treatment volumes.5 In
the current study, it was not possible to ascertain whether
the survival benefits observed with preoperative RT were
attributable to tumor downstaging because the tumor
staging information in the SEER database reported only
pathologic staging data. Because preoperative treatment
fields in patients with esophageal cancer (5 cm superiorly
Cancer

June 1, 2013

and inferiorly from macroscopic tumor disease) are classically smaller than postoperative treatment fields (coverage
of the entire postoperative esophagectomy surgical bed),20
they should result in less radiation dose to the heart and
lungs (Fig. 4) and be less toxic. We hypothesized that the
survival benefits of preoperative RT may be related to
decreased cardiopulmonary mortality.
Several studies in the breast cancer literature have
demonstrated that cardiac-related mortality decreases
over time in patients treated with RT after lumpectomy,
presumably because of improved, modern radiation techniques that minimize the radiation dose to the heart.21-24
However, the published literature concerning late cardiopulmonary mortality in patients with esophageal cancer
who are treated with RT is scarce. Morota et al investigated 74 patients who were treated with definitive concurrent CRT using an extended field from the
supraclavicular fossa to the gastroesophageal junction,
and concluded that the risk of grade 3 or greater cardiopulmonary toxicities was greater in patients aged > 75
years (29% vs 3%).25 In Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG) 85-01, 28% of patients had grade 3 or
higher toxicity, but only 1 of those cases was related to cardiopulmonary disease.26 Ishikura et al have shown that
large-field RT with concurrent chemotherapy has a high
rate (12%) of grade 3 or higher cardiopulmonary toxicity.
Recent data published in patients with esophageal cancer
have also indicated a direct correlation between cardiac
radiation volume/dose and symptomatic cardiac toxicity.27 However, the results in the population of patients
with esophageal cancer in the current study demonstrated
no difference in cardiopulmonary mortality between
patients treated preoperatively versus those treated
postoperatively.
The most likely explanation for this lack of difference is that patients are far more likely to die of esophageal
cancer before reaching the point at which RT may have an
increased effect on cardiopulmonary mortality, as supported by the few total number of cardiopulmonary
events noted in the current study (n ¼ 405) compared
with esophageal cancer-related deaths (n ¼ 3124). The
competing risk analysis was performed to account for this
possible confounding issue, but failed to demonstrate a
higher incidence of cardiopulmonary mortality in patients
treated with RT. Another possible explanation for this
lack of difference may be related to improved treatment
techniques, which may translate into decreased cardiopulmonary toxicity and offset the deleterious effects of postoperative RT. This possibility is supported by the
suggestion in the current study data that there may be a

trend toward decreased cardiopulmonary mortality over
time. A third possibility is that patients in the SEER
cohort who were treated with postoperative RT may not
have been consistently treated with classic, large treatment
volumes that encompassed the entire surgical bed. However, details of radiation treatments are not available in
the SEER database to investigate this issue further.
Although the results of the current study indicate no
difference in cardiopulmonary mortality between the
patients receiving preoperative RT and those receiving
postoperative RT, the SEER database does not allow us to
address the potentially increased risk of cardiopulmonary
morbidity that is not ultimately the cause of death.
Patients who receive postoperative RT may be more likely
to experience adverse side effects that are not severe
enough to cause an increase in mortality. It is possible that
patients treated with preoperative RT are more likely to
tolerate additional interventions after surgery such as adjuvant chemotherapy and that this is the source of the survival difference between the preoperative and
postoperative RT groups. However, the limitations of the
SEER database prevent us from performing this analysis.
There is a broad range of late cardiopulmonary mortality
including but not limited to acute myocardial infarction,
pericarditis, pericardial or pleural effusion, heart failure,
and radiation pneumonitis.
We acknowledge limitations in the current study.
First, because patients who receive preoperative RT have a
1982

risk of being clinically overstaged (approximately
15%),18,19 the group treated with preoperative RT may
have included patients with a more favorable diagnosis,
resulting in overinflated survival outcomes and a misclassification bias.28 This bias is compounded by the inability
to directly compare patients stage-for-stage in the SEER
database because tumor staging is reported as postsurgical
pathologic staging. However, the sensitivity analysis as
performed in the current study suggests that the survival
advantages of preoperative RT remained clinically

the lung and heart (indicated by orange) receiving radiation.

significant when taking into account various scenarios of
clinical overstaging in the patient population.
Second, an important caveat of the current study is
that the SEER database does not provide data regarding
chemotherapy. However, both preoperative and postoperative RT are almost always administered concurrently
with chemotherapy,1-5,7,26,28 and therefore it is less likely
that the lack of chemotherapy data is a source of bias in
the concurrent setting. In addition, chemotherapy itself
can be a possible cause of cardiopulmonary mortality.
Although there has been some research regarding cardiopulmonary mortality in patients with esophageal cancer
who are treated with both chemotherapy and RT,25 to the
best of our knowledge there have been no studies performed to date to determine whether there is a synergistic
effect between the 2 modalities on cardiopulmonary
mortality. Finally, the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy
after trimodality treatment could also be a potential
confounder. However, none of the randomized trials
evaluating trimodality included the use of adjuvant
chemotherapy, and therefore it is unlikely that a significant percentage of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy after undergoing trimodality treatment.
In summary, preoperative RT appears to provide
superior survival compared with postoperative RT and
does so without increasing cardiopulmonary mortality
over surgery alone as studied in this population-based
analysis of patients with esophageal cancer from the SEER
database. With the lack of randomized controlled trials
addressing the optimal sequencing of RT in relation to
surgery, these data support the use of preoperative RT as
the standard of care for patients with locally advanced
esophageal cancer and should not be withheld out of
concern for cardiopulmonary mortality.
