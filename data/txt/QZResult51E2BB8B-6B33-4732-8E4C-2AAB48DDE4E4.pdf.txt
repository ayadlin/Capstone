Abstract
Trastuzumab is the standard of care for HER2-positive breast
cancer patients, markedly improving disease-free and overall
survival. Combined with chemotherapy, it enhances patient outcomes, but cardiotoxicity due to the trastuzumab treatment
poses a serious adverse effect. MM-302 is a HER2-targeted
PEGylated liposome that encapsulates doxorubicin to facilitate
its delivery to HER2-overexpressing tumor cells while limiting
exposure to nontarget tissues, including the heart. In this study,
we evaluated the feasibility and preclinical activity of combining MM-302 with trastuzumab. MM-302 and trastuzumab
target different domains of the HER2 receptor and thus could
simultaneously bind HER2-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro
and in vivo. Furthermore, trastuzumab did not disrupt the
mechanism of action of MM-302 in delivering doxorubicin to

the n0ucleus and inducing DNA damage. Reciprocally, MM302 did not interfere with the ability of trastuzumab to block
prosurvival p-Akt signaling. Interestingly, coadministration of
the two agents acutely increased the deposition of MM-302 in
human xenograft tumors and subsequently increased the
expression of the DNA damage marker p-p53. Finally, the
combination of MM-302 and trastuzumab induced synergistic
antitumor activity in HER2-overexpressing xenograft models of
breast and gastric cancer. Collectively, our ﬁndings highlight a
novel combination therapy that efﬁciently targets HER2-overexpressing cells through multiple mechanisms and support the
ongoing investigation of combined MM-302/trastuzumab therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in a randomized
phase II clinical trial. Cancer Res; 76(6); 1517–27. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

response rate to trastuzumab as a single agent is modest
(15%–30%), while combination with various chemotherapies
can increase response to 50%–75% in HER2-positive breast
cancer patients (2, 4). However, among those who do respond,
nearly all eventually progress following initial beneﬁt and acquire
resistance over time (4, 5). Thus, continued development of novel
therapies for HER2-positive breast cancer and their use in combination with established targeted therapies such as trastuzumab
remains a necessary goal to improve patient outcomes.
Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin are well-established chemotherapeutics used to treat a variety of cancers including leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder, multiple myeloma, and
breast cancer among others. Doxorubicin has proven particularly
effective in treating HER2-positive breast cancer patients, possibly
as a result of the proximity between the TOP2A gene (a target of
doxorubicin) and the HER2 gene on chromosome 17 (6, 7).
However, administration of doxorubicin is associated with its
own serious side effects including hematologic alterations and
life-threatening cardiotoxicity, thus limiting cumulative dosage
and clinical utility (8, 9). In the pivotal trial leading to approval of
trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer, clinical beneﬁt was
identiﬁed in combination with doxorubicin, but signiﬁcant cardiotoxicity was also observed, resulting in an accompanying black
box warning (4). As a result of these safety concerns, use of
doxorubicin for treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer has
decreased in recent years despite its efﬁcacy (10, 11).
MM-302 is a HER2-targeted liposome encapsulating approximately 20,000 molecules of doxorubicin in its core and 45

An estimated 25% of breast cancer patients are deﬁned as
HER2-positive, characterized by tumor overexpression of the
HER2 receptor protein and ampliﬁcation of the HER2 gene. Other
cancers including gastric, ovarian, and bladder also exhibit HER2
overexpression to varying degrees (1). Trastuzumab is a mAb
developed to bind the HER2 receptor and proposed to function
through multiple mechanisms including decreased PI3K/Akt signaling, increased degradation of the HER2 receptor protein following endocytosis, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC; ref. 2). By identifying those patients whose tumors overexpress the necessary molecular target (HER2), breast cancer cells
can be targeted directly while sparing healthy cells, thus mitigating
potential adverse events and toxicities. Trastuzumab has thus
become a key component in the oncologist's arsenal against
HER2-positive cancer (3). Despite these advances, overall

single-chain anti-HER2 antibodies (scFv) conjugated to its
surface. This agent is currently in development for the treatment
of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and is under consideration for additional oncology indications. Liposomal encapsulation dramatically alters the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of doxorubicin. By virtue of their comparatively large
size, liposomes deposit in areas with leaky or functionally
porous vasculature including tumors, areas of inﬂammation,
the liver and spleen. This phenomenon is known as enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect (12). The normal
vasculatures of healthy organs such as the heart typically
prevent leakage and signiﬁcant accumulation of liposomes.
Clinical studies have demonstrated cardiosafety advantages of
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD/Doxil) relative to free
doxorubicin, but lack of risk–beneﬁt ratio has precluded
approval of Doxil for the treatment of breast cancer in the
United States (13, 14). MM-302 shares the extended pharmacokinetics and EPR-mediated deposition in tumors with PLD.
However, unlike PLD, following deposition in the tumor
microenvironment, anti-HER2 antibodies on the surface of
MM-302 speciﬁcally increase targeting to HER2-overexpressing
tumor cells with a resultant increase in antitumor activity
relative to PLD in multiple preclinical models (15, 16). Additional work has elucidated a critical threshold of surface HER2
expression, approximately 200,000 HER2 receptors per cell for
efﬁcient binding and uptake of MM-302 (17). Importantly,
cardiomyocytes do not possess the requisite number of HER2
receptors required to efﬁciently mediate the uptake of MM-302,
potentially mitigating safety concerns (18, 19).
In this article, we demonstrate the feasibility and enhanced
antitumor activity of dual HER2-targeting with MM-302 and
trastuzumab. MM-302 and trastuzumab each target different
domains of the HER2 receptor (J. Marks; manuscript in preparation; ref. 20) and we show that both agents are able to
simultaneously bind to HER2-positive cells. The mechanism
of action of MM-302 (delivery of doxorubicin and DNA
damage) is not altered by the presence of trastuzumab, while
the ability of trastuzumab to decrease intracellular signaling
(p-Akt) is not affected by the presence of MM-302. Interestingly, coadministration of trastuzumab with MM-302 acutely
increased deposition of MM-302 to BT474-M3 and NCI-N87
xenograft tumors in vivo, with a resultant increase in DNA
damage (p-p53). Finally, we demonstrate synergistic antitumor activity of the MM-302 and trastuzumab combination
in human xenograft models of breast and gastric cancer.
This work provides the preclinical foundation for the combination of MM-302 plus trastuzumab, which is currently being
investigated in the ongoing phase II HERMIONE trial in
metastatic breast cancer patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer
NCT02213744).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
BT474-M3 is a HER2-overexpressing cell line received as a gift
from Hermes Biosciences. NCI-N87 cells were purchased from
ATCC and authenticated before receipt. Cell lines were obtained
between 2008 and 2011 and propagated for less than 6 months
after resuscitation. Both cell lines were grown at 37 C in RPMI/
10% FBS supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin and used at
P5 or less.

Fluorescence microscopy
Liposome preparation. MM-302 liposomes were prepared as previously described (16). Labeled liposomes were prepared containing far red-ﬂuorescent carbocyanine tracer DiIC18(5)-DS
(D12730, abbreviated DiI5; Life Technologies), which intercalates into the lipid bilayer of the liposome. Corresponding liposomes without doxorubicin were also prepared ("empty").
Fluorescent-labeled trastuzumab. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was
purchased through CuraScript, Inc. and labeled per vendor's
instructions with Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-555 (Life
Technologies).
In vitro ﬂuorescence microscopy. A total of 10,000 cells were plated
per chamber (Nunc Lab Tek II Slides) and simultaneously treated
with 1 mmol/L DiI5-MM-302 and 1 mmol/L Alexa 488–trastuzumab for 1 hour on ice at 4 C, ﬁxed with 3.7% formaldaldehyde for
15 minutes at room temperature, and stained with Hoechst 33342
(Life Technologies). Images (20) and (40) were captured with
a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U microscope.
Nuclear doxorubicin/liposome imaging by high content
microscopy
BT474-M3 and NCI-N87 cells were plated in 96-well tissue
culture plates at 10,000 cells per well and treated with DiI5-MM302, trastuzumab, or DiI5-MM-302 and trastuzumab at the
indicated ﬁnal concentrations. Twenty-four hours later, cells were
ﬁxed with 3.7% formaldehyde (15 minutes at room temperature),
incubated with 1:1,000 Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) and
1:10,000 Whole Cell Blue Dye (8403501; Life Technologies).
Plates were scanned using an ArrayWorx High Content Scanner
(Applied Precision) with a 10 objective for Hoechst 33342 (460
nm), doxorubicin (595 nm), and APC/DiI5 (657 nm). Identiﬁcation of nuclei, cell segmentation, and signal quantitation were
performed using ImageRail software (21). Data are presented as
the mean pixel intensity for all cells in a given well for the
indicated channel (approx. 4,000 cells evaluated per well).
In vitro viability
BT474-M3 and NCI-N87 cells were plated in 96-well tissue
culture plates at 5,000 cells per well, treated with MM-302,
trastuzumab, or MM-302 and trastuzumab at the indicated ﬁnal
concentrations (each in triplicate) at 37 C for 72 hours. Cell TiterGlo assay was performed per vendor instructions (Promega).
Luminescence was measured using an Envision 2103 Multilabel
plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Percent viability for each treatment is
calculated relative to untreated.
Animal studies: tumor growth inhibition and liposome delivery
Seven-week-old female NCR/nu mice were purchased from
Taconic and 7-week-old female nu/nu mice were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories. The care and treatment of experimental animals was in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee guidelines.
Establishment of xenografts. NCR/nu mice were implanted with a

were inoculated with 7.5  106 NCI-N87 cells subcutaneously
into the right ﬂank of the mouse.
Tumor growth inhibition. Once tumors reached a volume of 200 to
300 mm3, mice were randomized into groups of 8 to 10 mice/
group of equal average tumor volume and dosed intravenously
with: PBS (control), MM-302 [3 mg/kg (doxorubicin), i.v. every 7
days for 3 doses], trastuzumab (7 mg/kg loading dose, then 3.5
mg/kg every 3 days for duration of study), or the combination of
MM-302 and trastuzumab. Tumors were measured twice/week
with a caliper. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula:
width2  length  0.52. Bliss (synergy) analysis was performed as
follows: Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in each treatment group
was calculated using the following formula:


ðVtreated ðdÞ=Vtreated ð0ÞÞ
TGIð%Þ ¼ 1 
;
ðVcontrol ðdÞ=Vcontrol ð0ÞÞ
where Vtreated and Vcontrol represent the median volumes of tumor
at a given time point in mice treated with drug (MM-302 and/or
trastuzumab) or PBS (control). By using TGI values from the
monotherapy groups, the Bliss additivity model was used to
predict the additive effect in the combination group:
TGIBliss Additivity ¼ TGIMM-302 þ TGITrastuzumab
 TGIMM-302 TGITrastuzumab
Values less than additive indicate antagonism, while values
above additive indicate synergy (22–26).

Delivery studies. Once tumors reached a volume of 200 to 300
mm3, mice were dosed intravenously with PBS (control), trastuzumab (7 mg/kg), DiI5-MM-302 (3 mg/kg), or trastuzumab
(7 mg/kg) and DiI5-MM-302 (3 mg/kg); or puriﬁed human IgG
(7 mg/kg; 1-001-A, R&D Systems) or trastuzumab-DM1 (7 mg/kg;
CuraScript). Alternatively, mice were dosed with Alexa-555-trastuzumab (7 mg/kg) and DiI5-MM-302 (3 mg/kg). Tumors were
collected 4, 24 and 72 hours postinjection of agents. Five minutes
prior to sacriﬁce, mice were dosed intravenously with 200 mL of
FITC-lectin (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) to label perfused vessels,
then perfused with PBS. Tumors were collected and processed in
accordance with each assay described below.
Quantiﬁcation of doxorubicin within tumors
After collection, tumors were immediately frozen on dry ice and
stored at 80 C until processing. Quantiﬁcation of doxorubicin
in tumors by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
was performed as described previously (18).
Histologic analysis of tumor liposome deposition
Tumors were embedded in OCT compound (TissueTek), frozen
in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection, and prepared for
cryosection (10-mm thickness). Slides were air-dried for 30 minutes at room temperature and counterstained with Hoechst 33342
diluted 1:5,000 in ProLong Gold mounting media (Molecular
Probes). Slides were imaged on an Aperio ScanScope FL scanner
(Leica Biosystems) at 20 magniﬁcation as described in Onsum

and colleagues (19). Images were analyzed using custom rule sets
written in Deﬁniens Developer XD (Deﬁniens). Brieﬂy, individual
tumors were identiﬁed using the Hoechst layer and the liposome
mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) determined for each tumor.
Distribution of the liposome MFI within the tumor was determined as follows: after deﬁning the tumor region, the area was
subdivided into 1-pixel subobjects and each subobject was
assigned into different classes based on the liposome MFI:
<1,000, 1,000–2,000, 2,000–3,000, 3,000–4,000, 4,000–6,000
MFI, and >6,000. The relative percentage of area occupied by
different MFI classes was then determined.

Phosphoprotein analysis: p-p53 (Ser15) and p-Akt (Ser473)
p-p53 (K15113D-1) or p-Akt (K150MND-1) assays were
performed as per manufacturer's instructions (Meso Scale
Discovery).

Results

Confocal microscopy of BT474-M3 xenografts
Slides with 10-mm thick frozen tumor sections were air-dried at
room temperature for 20 minutes, counterstained, and mounted
with Hoechst 33342 diluted 1:50,00 into ProLong Gold anti-fade
reagent (Molecular Probes). Slides were imaged on a Leica SP8 X
inverted confocal system at 405 nm (solid-state diode laser), 487
nm, 555 nm and 647 nm (WhiteLight lasers) with a 40X/1.3 oil
objective (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Images were
visualized with open source Fiji software (http://ﬁji.sc/Fiji).

MM-302 and trastuzumab can bind cells simultaneously
The single-chain F5 antibody on the surface of MM-302 speciﬁcally targets domain I of the ErbB2/HER2 receptor protein
while trastuzumab binds domain IV (Fig. 1A). Despite targeting
different epitopes on the HER2 receptor, it was essential to
determine whether both MM-302 and trastuzumab can bind to
the same cells given the unique physical characteristics of a
liposome and therapeutic antibody (Fig. 1B). First, we simultaneously incubated ﬂuorescent DiI5-MM-302 liposomes and
Alexa Fluor 488–trastuzumab with HER2-overexpressing
BT474-M3 cells (breast) and evaluated membrane-bound signal
using ﬂuorescence microscopy. Empty liposomes without doxorubicin were used to minimize autoﬂuorescence and experiments
were performed on ice to minimize internalization. BT474-M3

Dual HER2 Targeting with MM-302 and Trastuzumab

cells tend to grow together in clumps or patches in vitro and
when inspected, the MM-302 signal is clearly evident on the
periphery of groups of cells (Fig. 1C, MM-302, top and middle).
Trastuzumab is present in the same peripheral locations as
well as between individual cells (Fig. 1C, trastuzumab, top and
middle). These observations are consistent with the physical
size differences between the antibody trastuzumab and MM302. When individual BT474-M3 cells are located, the signal
from MM-302 directly overlaps with trastuzumab, consistent
with both drugs binding to the HER2 receptor on the
same cell (Fig. 1C, bottom). Altering the ratio of either drug
up to 50-fold in excess or adding the drugs sequentially in
either order (with time intervals) did not affect binding (data
not shown).
We next quantitatively evaluated binding of MM-302 and
delivery of doxorubicin to the cell nucleus in the presence of
trastuzumab. BT474-M3 and HER2-overexpressing NCI-N87 cells
(gastric) were simultaneously incubated with DiI5-MM-302 (0–2
mmol/L) and trastuzumab (0, 1, or 10 mg/mL) for 24, 48, and 72
hours and liposome signal (DiI5) and nuclear doxorubicin then
evaluated by high-throughput ﬂuorescence microscopy. A dosedependent increase in liposome signal (Fig. 2A) and nuclear
doxorubicin (Fig. 2B) is observed with increasing MM-302 concentration in both cell lines at 24 hours (blue lines). The addition
of trastuzumab at 1 mg/mL (light green) or 10 mg/mL (dark green)
did not alter the amount of MM-302 liposome bound or nuclear
doxorubicin in either BT474-M3 or NCI-N87 cells (Fig. 2A and B).
Similar results were observed at 48 and 72 hours (data not
shown).
MM-302, but not trastuzumab, activates p53
p53 protein levels and phosphorylation/activation are tightly
controlled under normal conditions by the cell. However, in
response to DNA damage (induced by UV, IR, or chemical agents
including doxorubicin), p53 can become phosphorylated in the
N-terminal domain, leading to its activation and accumulation
(27). To investigate this response, BT474-M3 and NCI-N87 cells
were treated with 1 mmol/L MM-302 for 0–24 hours and p-p53
(Ser15) evaluated by electrochemiluminescent MSD assay. Consistent with the accumulation of doxorubicin in the nucleus and
resultant DNA damage, an increase in p-p53 is observed when
cells are treated with MM-302 (Fig. 2C, blue line). The increase in
p-p53 observed with MM-302 is not altered by cotreatment with
trastuzumab at 1 or 10 mg/mL (Fig. 2C, light/dark green lines).
Trastuzumab alone has no effect on p-p53 under the conditions
tested (Fig. 2C, pink lines).

www.aacrjournals.org

Combining MM-302 and trastuzumab increases cell death
in vitro
To determine the effect of combining MM-302 and trastuzumab on cell growth in vitro, BT474-M3 and NCI-N87 cells were
treated with trastuzumab alone (10 mg/mL), MM-302 alone (0.5
mmol/L), or MM-302 and trastuzumab. Viability was evaluated 72
hours following treatment and calculated relative to untreated
cells. Trastuzumab alone reduced viability in both cell lines by
approximately 15% (Fig. 3, pink) while MM-302 alone reduced
BT474-M3 viability by 45% and NCI-N87 by 65%. In both BT474M3 and NCI-N87 cells, the combination of MM-302 with trastuzumab signiﬁcantly reduces in vitro viability relative to either
treatment alone (58 and 80%, respectively; Fig. 3, green), consistent with an additive effect based on percent viability.
MM-302 and trastuzumab can bind the same cells in human
xenograft tumors
We next sought to determine whether both MM-302 and
trastuzumab could bind to the same cells in vivo, as we observed
in vitro. Mice bearing BT474-M3 tumors were injected with ﬂuorescent DiI5-MM-302 ("empty"; 3 mg/kg) and Alexa-555-trastuzumab (7 mg/kg) for 4 or 24 hours and tumor sections then
imaged by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy. MM-302 is present
within and proximal to perfused blood vessels (visualized by
FITC-lectin) as well as on the cell membranes of multiple nearby
cells at 24 hours (Fig. 4, MM-302/red). Trastuzumab is widely
distributed and observed on the surface of most tumor cells within
the section (Fig. 4, trastuzumab/green), but is not as evident
within vessels as MM-302 (consistent with faster distribution of
an antibody). Colocalization of MM-302 and trastuzumab is
readily apparent on multiple cells within proximity to the blood
vessels (Fig. 4, merge-yellow). Similar co-localization is observed
at 4 hours (additional representative images are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1).

Trastuzumab, but not MM-302, reduces p-Akt signaling
One of the reported mechanisms by which trastuzumab halts
tumor growth is by decreasing signaling cascades downstream of
the HER2 receptor, including the PI3K/Akt pathway (28). Treatment of BT474-M3 and NCI-N87 cells with trastuzumab alone
(1 mg/mL) results in a signiﬁcant decrease in basal p-Akt (Ser473)
signal, with this reduction maintained at least until 24 hours (Fig.
2D, pink line). Cotreatment with MM-302 did not alter the
decrease in p-Akt signal attributed to trastuzumab (Fig. 2D, green
line), while MM-302 alone has no effect on p-Akt signal at the
same timepoints (Fig. 2D, blue line).

MM-302 and trastuzumab colocalize in BT474-M3 human xenografts. NCR/nu mice bearing BT474-M3 tumors were simultaneously administered DiI5-MM-302
("empty", no doxorubicin) and Alexa-555–trastuzumab. Five minutes prior to sacriﬁce, mice were injected with FITC-lectin to identify perfused blood
vessels. Twenty-four hours after administration of DiI5-MM-302 and Alexa-555–trastuzumab, tumors were excised, immediately frozen, and sectioned.
Slides were imaged on a Leica SP8 X inverted confocal system with a 40/1.3 oil objective. Representative images of MM-302 (red), trastuzumab (green),
vessels (magenta), and DNA (Hoechst; blue) are shown. Yellow, colocalization of MM-302 and trastuzumab. Bottom row, close-up of selected region from upper row.

Combining MM-302 and trastuzumab increases DNA damage
signaling in vivo
Building on our in vitro ﬁndings, we next evaluated whether we
could also detect changes in p-p53 levels within tumor xenografts
following treatment with MM-302. Mice bearing BT474-M3 or
NCI-N87 human xenograft tumors were treated with trastuzumab
alone, MM-302 alone or MM-302 and trastuzumab for 4, 24, or 72
hours. Tumors were collected and levels of p-p53 (Ser15) evaluated. No changes in p-p53 were observed in the untreated or
trastuzumab-treated lysates at any timepoint (Fig. 5A, gray/pink).
Signiﬁcant p-p53 was observed 24 hours after MM-302 treatment
(P < 0.0001), with a comparable increase in signal from 4 to 24
hours with or without trastuzumab coadministration (Fig. 5A,
blue/green). Interestingly, while both treatments increase pp53 signal at 72 hours relative to the 24-hour timepoint, the
signal is greater with trastuzumab coadministration (P ¼ 0.0009).
Similar trends are observed in both xenograft models
although the absolute values and variability are much greater in
the NCI-N87 model, resulting in signiﬁcance only at the 72-hour
timepoint (P ¼ 0.0112).

Trastuzumab acutely increases deposition of MM-302 in human
xenograft tumors
Our in vitro combination experiments showed that trastuzumab did not increase p-p53 in combination with MM-302, yet
increased levels of p-p53 were observed in tumor xenografts
treated with the same combination. This led us to question
whether trastuzumab was inﬂuencing the amount of MM-302
reaching the tumor in vivo. Mice bearing human BT474-M3 or
NCI-N87 xenograft tumors were treated with MM-302 alone or
simultaneously with trastuzumab, tumors collected 4, 24, or 72
hours after drug administration and doxorubicin levels
analyzed by HPLC. When MM-302 was administered as a monotherapy to BT474-M3 tumors, approximately 5% of the injected

1522 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

doxorubicin/gram tissue (i.d./g) was detected in tumors at 4
hours (Fig. 5B left, blue). Consistent with the p-p53 results,
when trastuzumab was injected simultaneously with MM-302,
there was a greater than 2-fold increase in the amount of
doxorubicin detected in the BT474-M3 tumor at 4 hours relative
to MM-302 alone (P ¼ 0.0076; Fig. 5B left, green). These results
are consistent with a mechanism wherein trastuzumab increases
MM-302 delivery, which in turn results in the increased p-p53
that was experimentally observed. Doxorubicin levels increase
from 4 to 24 hours with MM-302 alone, consistent with continued deposition of liposome at the tumor site as a result of the
long-circulating pharmacokinetics of PEGylated liposomes.
There continues to be greater doxorubicin in the BT474-M3
cells at 24 hours with coadministration of trastuzumab relative
to MM-302 alone, although the values were not statistically
signiﬁcant. By 72 hours, there is little difference between
the amounts of doxorubicin in BT474-M3 tumors treated with
MM-302 or MM-302 and trastuzumab. In the gastric NCI-N87
xenograft model, a nearly 2-fold increase in doxorubicin levels
was observed at 4 hours when trastuzumab is coadministered
with MM-302 (Fig. 5B right; P ¼ 0.0449), while a signiﬁcant
increase is also observed at 24 hours with the combination (P ¼
0.0024). Changes in MM-302 deposition were not observed
with coinjection of a nonspeciﬁc human IgG, a monoclonal
human antibody against EGFR, or PBS, but an increase was seen
with trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1; Supplementary Fig. S2 and
data not shown). In addition, the pharmacokinetics of MM302 was not affected by trastuzumab, indicating that changes in
systemic exposure were not responsible for the differences in
tumor uptake (Supplementary Fig. S3).
As further conﬁrmation, frozen sections from BT474-M3
tumors treated with DiI5-MM-302 alone or in combination with
trastuzumab were collected 4, 24, or 72 hours post-injection, then
imaged and analyzed to quantify mean liposome ﬂuorescence
intensity (MFI) per tumor. Consistent with the doxorubicin

Figure 5.
Coadministration of MM-302 with trastuzumab increases p53 phosphorylation and MM-302 deposition. A, BT474-M3 or NCI-N87 tumor-bearing mice
(n ¼ 5–8/group) were dosed with trastuzumab alone (7 mg/kg; pink), MM-302 alone (3 mg/kg; blue), or MM-302 (3 mg/kg) and trastuzumab (trast; 7 mg/kg;
green); untreated (U; gray). Tumors were collected 4, 24 or 72 hours after treatment, frozen, and lysates prepared. p-p53 (Ser15) signal was evaluated by
electrochemiluminescent assay (Meso Scale Discovery). B, mice were treated as in A and tumors analyzed by HPLC to determine the total doxorubicin in
the tumor expressed as percent of injected dose per gram of tissue (% i.d./g). MM-302 alone, blue; MM-302 þ trastuzumab, green. Untreated tumor produced no

results, coadministration of trastuzumab increased DiI5-MM-302
signal in the tumor at both 4 and 24 hours relative to MM-302
alone (Fig. 6A; P ¼ 0.0159 and P ¼ 0.0317, respectively). A trend
towards increased MM-302 deposition was also observed at 72
hours with trastuzumab (P ¼ 0.0517, n.s.).
Because of their large size, nanoparticles are known to have
challenges effectively penetrating into tumors. Therefore, we
sought to investigate whether the effect on deposition seen with
trastuzumab also improved liposome penetration. Changes in
liposome spatial distribution were evaluated by assigning each
individual pixel within the tumor to a distinct MFI class (from
0—1,000 up to >6,000 MFI). This allowed us to generate a
"heatmap" of liposome distribution within the tumor; representative tumors for DiI5-MM-302 alone (left) and DiI5-MM302 with trastuzumab (right) are shown for the 24-hour time
point (Fig. 6B). The relative percentages of tumor area belonging to the deﬁned MFI classes were quantiﬁed for each tumor.
Coadministration with trastuzumab resulted in greater overall
delivery of MM-302 as indicated by an increase in tumor areas
(%) with higher DiI5 ﬂuorescence intensity (Fig. 6C, yelloworange-red). The percent tumor area with the highest liposome
intensity (>6,000 MFI) increased from 0.2% to 0.7% at 4 hours
(P ¼ 0.0159), from 0.2% to 2.2% at 24 hours (P ¼ 0.0317), and

www.aacrjournals.org

from 0.2% to 2.5% at 72 hours (n.s.), indicating that areas of
the tumor are exposed to higher liposome concentrations (as
opposed to a general overall increase). Similar trends were
observed in the NCI-N87 model; however, the results were not
statistically signiﬁcant.

Combining MM-302 and trastuzumab improves antitumor
activity
We observed DNA damage from MM-302 and reduced p-Akt
signaling from trastuzumab when combined in vitro, as well as
increased liposome deposition when MM-302 and trastuzumab were coadministered in vivo. We next investigated whether
these observations would translate into increased antitumor
activity. Mice bearing either BT474-M3 or NCI-N87 xenograft
tumors were treated with MM-302 alone, trastuzumab alone, or
coadministration of both drugs. Each monotherapy was effective at reducing tumor volume relative to control in both
models (Fig. 7A and B, blue and pink). In the BT474-M3
model, the combination of MM-302 and trastuzumab had
signiﬁcantly greater antitumor activity than either drug alone
(P < 0.0001), including 6 of 10 tumors with greater than 50%
reduction in tumor volume and 2 complete regressions

Discussion
Chemotherapies such as anthracyclines remain a primary
option for treating cancer patients because of their broad antitumor activity. However, these agents are relatively indiscriminate
with regard to their activity against healthy or cancerous cells,
resulting in side effects that can impact quality of life and limit
their use. Among cancer survivors, the use of conventional anthracyclines are associated with long-term secondary effects including
the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; refs. 9, 29–32). Cardiotoxicity
associated with the use of anthracyclines has also been well
documented and is often exacerbated in combination with drugs
including trastuzumab and taxanes (4, 33). Recent studies have
shown the beneﬁt of continuing trastuzumab treatment in HER2positive patients even following disease progression, making it
likely that this drug will remain in use through all lines of therapy
(34). For this reason, it is increasingly important to ﬁnd suitable
combination partners for trastuzumab. Targeted liposomes such
as MM-302 provide an attractive option for incorporating anthracycline therapy with trastuzumab, while moderating potential
side effects.
Liposomes are signiﬁcantly larger than therapeutic antibodies
such as trastuzumab and the target HER2 receptor. Answering
the basic question whether both drugs could bind to the same

(Fig. 7A, green). Similarly, in the NCI-N87 model, the combination had greater antitumor activity than either trastuzumab (P <
0.0001) or MM-302 alone (P ¼ 0.0002), including 2 of 9 tumors
with greater than 50% reduction in tumor volume (Fig. 7B, green).
Bliss additivity analysis of both models demonstrates that the
beneﬁt of the combination is synergistic, or greater than the
predicted sum of each drug alone (Supplementary Fig. S4). In
the case of the BT474-M3 xenograft tumors, synergy is indicated at
every time point tested despite the magnitude likely being restricted or minimized due to the occurrence of complete regressions
(Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. S4).

HER2-overexpressing cells was a necessary starting point. On the
basis of ﬂuorescence microscopy, both agents are present on the
same BT474-M3 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Some differences in
the pattern of distribution of each agent are observed in vitro, but
when single cells were identiﬁed, colocalization was readily
apparent. We also evaluated the HER2-overexpressing SUM190 cell line, which tends to grow as individual cells, and colocalization of trastuzumab and MM-302 on single cells was
readily observed by ﬂuorescence microscopy (data not shown).
We were further able to capture binding of MM-302 and
trastuzumab to the same tumor cells in vivo by injecting ﬂuorescent DiI5-MM-302 and Alexa-555–trastuzumab into mice
carrying BT474-M3 xenografts. By 4 hours, MM-302 is observed
within tumor blood vessels as well as on the membranes of
numerous proximal cells. Trastuzumab is observed on the
surface of multiple cells throughout the tumor. As trastuzumab
is likely to travel further and faster than MM-302, the colocalization is not absolute but is clearly evident in locations where
both drugs are present. Future studies could include a more
extensive time course (both earlier and later) to shed light on
the relative kinetic distribution of each drug in vivo.
Beyond simultaneously binding to HER2-overexpressing cells,
MM-302 and trastuzumab did not inhibit each other's activity.
Delivery of doxorubicin to the nucleus by MM-302 and activation
of the DNA damage pathway (as indicated by p-p53) was nearly
identical whether trastuzumab was present or not. Stimulation of
the HER2 receptor results in downstream activation of the PI3K–
Akt pathway, which in turn leads to activation of transcription
factors leading to increased proliferation, angiogenesis, metastases, and survival (35). Treatment of BT474-M3 or NCI-N87 cells
with trastuzumab reduced basal pAkt signaling in vitro and this
inhibition was unchanged with coadministration of MM-302. The
additive killing effect when both drugs are coadministered in vitro
is consistent with each drug performing its intended function.
Thus, by multiple measurements, HER2-positive cells are impacted by the mechanisms of action of both MM-302 and trastuzumab. As antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)

is believed to be another signiﬁcant mechanism of action for
trastuzumab, we can speculate that even greater combinatorial
beneﬁt would be observed in the presence of a functional immune
system (36, 37).
Tumor vasculature is known to be irregular and tortuous, with
walls of varying thickness, typically favoring deposition of liposomes as they extravasate through leaky vessels, resulting in
increased tumor accumulation relative to organs possessing normal vasculature (38). Multiple reports have described effects of
trastuzumab on tumor vasculature and angiogenesis, including
reduced rates of VEGF production, changes in microvessel density
(MVD) and remodeling of tumor vessel organization (39–41).
The increase in MM-302 deposition we observed when trastuzumab was coadministered was unexpected, especially so rapidly
after injection of the drugs. Most published studies describe the
effects of trastuzumab on tumor vessels days to weeks after
treatment (rather than hours), although McCormack and colleagues describe changes in VEGF and CD31 in BT474 xenograft
tumors 48 hours after administration of trastuzumab (39, 41, 42).
We labeled CD31 to evaluate blood vessels in BT474-M3 tumors
following treatment with trastuzumab and observed multiple
subtle, yet signiﬁcant, effects including reductions in vessel length,
width and area (data not shown). It remains to be determined
whether these changes are responsible for the increased liposome
deposition. Normalization of the vessels would seem to oppose
increased delivery of liposomes and is unlikely to occur in such a
short time. However, brief, transient changes in vessel shape, size,
diameter, etc. (before or during transition to normalization)
could affect pressure or velocity of blood ﬂow, forcing more
liposomes through an already leaky tumor vasculature. Increased
blood pressure has been shown to increase tumor delivery of
nanoparticles clinically and possibly enhance the EPR effect,
although we have not evaluated this effect in our preclinical
models (12, 43). Another consideration is the release of cytokines
or growth factors mediated by the interaction between trastuzumab and the HER2 receptor on the tumor. Such a response might
alter the vessels or tumor microenvironment, making the tumor
more amenable to MM-302 deposition. VEGF is one such factor
known to inﬂuence many aspects of the vasculature including
blood pressure, angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis among
other biologic functions and it is a possibility we continue to

www.aacrjournals.org

explore (44). We did not observe increased deposition when
we coadministered MM-302 with a nonspeciﬁc human IgG or
antibodies speciﬁc for other targets. Notably, coadministration of
T-DM1 (same antibody component as trastuzumab; refs. 45, 46)
increased MM-302 deposition, further supporting the notion that
the response is HER2-speciﬁc (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The use of anthracyclines in HER2-positive breast cancer has
been declining for years due to concerns about cardiac risk (11).
A retrospective analysis by Montemurro and colleagues (10)
found that up to a third of eligible HER2-positive patients never
received an anthracycline at any point during their treatment
before dying. This is despite speciﬁc efﬁcacy of anthracyclines
against HER2-positive tumors (4, 47). We demonstrate significant beneﬁt of combining a HER2-targeted liposomal anthracycline and trastuzumab against HER2-overexpressing breast
(BT474-M3) and gastric (NCI-N87) xenograft models. MM-302
provides the beneﬁt of a liposome, which avoids deposition in
healthy tissues including the heart, combined with targeting
capability to speciﬁcally bind HER2-overexpressing tumor cells
and minimize interaction with low HER2-expressing cells. MM302 had a manageable safety proﬁle and demonstrated promising activity in heavily pretreated HER2-positive metastatic
breast cancer patients in a phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov

Abstract #CT234, http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/
75/15_Supplement/CT234?cited-by=yes&legid=canres;75/15_

will investigate the efﬁcacy and safety of MM-302 and trastuzumab in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer patients
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT02213744). The opportunity
to provide a targeted anthracycline such as MM-302 combined
with trastuzumab using a dual HER2-targeting strategy may offer
additional treatment options for HER2-positive cancer patients.
