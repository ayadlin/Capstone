Abstract
Improved treatments for pancreatic cancer remain a clinical imperative. Sabutoclax, a small
molecule BH3 mimetic, inhibits the function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Minocycline, a
synthetic tetracycline, displays antitumor activity. Here we offer evidence of the combinatorial
antitumor potency of these agents in several preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. Sabutoclax
induced growth arrest and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells and synergized with Minocycline to
yield a robust mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent cytotoxicity. This combinatorial property
relied upon loss of phosphorylated Stat3 insofar as reintroduction of activated Stat3 rescued cells
from toxicity. Tumor growth was inhibited potently in both immune-deficient and immunecompetent models with evidence of extended survival. Overall, our results showed that that the
combination of Sabutoclax and Minocycline was highly cytotoxic to pancreatic cancer cells and
safely efficacious in vivo.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely aggressive cancer that is
predicted to cause almost 40,000 deaths in the US this year (NCI 2014). PDAC is fairly
resistant to most standard therapies and results in a 5-year survival rate of about 4% (1).
These dire statistics, combined with the fact that there have been minimal new therapies
developed for PDAC over the last decade, highlight the need for new approaches to
effectively treat this invariably fatal disease.

Author Manuscript

The aggressive nature and dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer results partly
from the plethora of molecular changes that occur during PDAC development, one of which
is overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (2–5). Cancer cells
exploit this overexpression to evade cell death and as a mechanism promoting resistance to
diverse chemotherapeutic agents. Apoptosis reflects a balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins within cells. The ability of a cancer cell to shift the balance toward
survival promotes resistance to toxic factors (6).
Consequently, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have emerged as a novel therapeutic target.
While multiple strategies have attempted to target these molecules, BH3 mimetics have
shown significant promise. Pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effects in cells arise, ultimately,
as a consequence of physical interactions between anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
(7,8). Based on modeling predictions of these interactions, small molecules have been
developed that mimic the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic proteins and bind to the antiapoptotic proteins, thereby impeding their ability to inhibit apoptosis. These drugs represent
a novel and exciting new strategy in cancer therapeutic development (6).

Sabutoclax (BI-97C1) is a novel Apogossypol derivative BH3 mimetic developed by Wei et
al. (9–12). This compound binds to the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-XL,
and Bfl-1. It was originally identified based on its ability to bind Bcl-XL with low to
submicromolar binding affinity (11). We have previously shown that Sabutoclax shows
efficacy against prostate and colorectal cancers, two cancers that also overexpress antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (13,14). Minocycline is a synthetic tetracycline antibiotic that
displays marginal activity against multiple cancers (15–19). However, less than stellar
outcomes have diminished enthusiasm for using these drugs in cancer research. The
marginal single agent effects of Minocycline against cancer may be due to the fact that it
also impedes cell death in the face of toxicity or injury by inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis
and upregulation of Bcl-2 (20–22). In an attempt to develop a unique therapeutic strategy for
PDAC, we hypothesized that Sabutoclax and Minocycline might show therapeutic efficacy
against this disease when used in combination because of both the reliance of PDAC on the
Bcl-2 proteins for survival as well as the theoretical ability of Sabutoclax to counteract the
anti-apoptotic effects of Minocycline, thereby uncovering the true therapeutic potential of
this previously overlooked drug.

Materials and Methods
Human Cell Lines—MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, BxPC-3, AsPC-1, and HPNE cells were all
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). LT2 cells were purchased
from Millipore. MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS.
BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells were maintained in RMPI plus 10% FBS. HPNE and LT2 cells
were maintained with media according to distributor’s instructions. Cell lines were
expanded and cryopreserved at early passages and new vials were thawed out and used for
experiments approximately every 3 months.

Author Manuscript

Creation of KPC Mouse Cell Lines—Cell lines were derived from the ascites of tumor
bearing KPC mice. At the time of necropsy, ascitic fluid was collected from the mice and
centrifuged to pellet tumor cells. The pellet was repeatedly washed in PBS and centrifuged
before being resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 4% FBS and placed in culture. This
media was used to maintain these cell lines.
Drugs and Drug Administration—For all in vitro studies, Sabutoclax (produced by Dr.
Maurizio Pellecchia) was diluted in DMSO and Minocycline (Sigma) in PBS. For
combination treatments, Sabutoclax and Minocycline were administered to cells
simultaneously. zVAD-FMK (20 μM, Promega) was incubated with cells for 1 hour prior to
treatment with Sabutoclax and Minocycline. Caspase 8 specific inhibitor, z-IETD-FMK (20
μM, BD Pharmingen) was also incubated with cells for 1 hour before treatment with
Sabutoclax and Minocycline.

Author Manuscript

Proliferation Studies—5 × 103 cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with
Sabutoclax and/or Minocycline for 72 hours. Proliferation was assessed by MTT assay as
previously described (23). All data were normalized to the control.
Cell Death Assays—For Trypan Blue exclusion assays, 5 × 105 cells were plated in 6-cm
dishes, treated as indicated for 48 hours, and then assayed as previously described (24).
LDH Cytotoxicity Assays—5 × 105 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes and treated as
described. After 48 hours, media was collected from each dish and assayed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (LDH), Roche).

Author Manuscript

Cell Cycle Studies—1 × 106 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and cultured in normal
media with 0.5% serum for 48 hours. Cells for the zero hour time point were collected and
fixed at this point. Remaining plates were kept in either normal media or 750 nM Sabutoclax
for indicated time points. Once all cells were collected and fixed, they were incubated with
propidium iodide and FACS was used for cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle studies were done
as previously described (25).
Colony Forming Assay—MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with Sabutoclax (500 nM),
Minocycline (50 μM), or a combination of both for 24 hours. Cells were then trypsinized
and 1,000 cells were plated into 6-cm plates in triplicate. Cells were allowed to grow and

form colonies in normal media for approximately 14 days. Plates were then fixed and
stained with Giemsa.
Western Blotting—5 × 105 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes and treated as described.
After 48 hours, whole cell lysates were prepared and western blotting analysis was carried
out as previously described (24). Primary antibodies used for these studies are PARP
(1:1,000), Stat3 (1:1,000), pStat3 (1:750), Mcl-1 (1:1,000), Survivin (1:750), p21 (1:750),
p27 (1:1,000), Cyclin D1(1:500), Caspase 2 (1:1,000), Caspase 3 (1:1,000), Caspase 6
(1:1,000), Caspase 7 (1:1,000), Caspase 8 (1:1,000), Caspase 10 (1:1,000), Caspase 12
(1:1,000), AIF (1:1,000), pRB (1:750) (Cell Signaling), EF1-α (1:1,000, Millipore), and
Actin (1:5,000, Sigma). Densitometric analysis was done using ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health).

Constructs and Transfection
Stat3Y705F Clones: MIA PaCa-2 or PANC-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid
expressing a mutated form of Stat3 (pRc.CMV.Stat3Y705F, Addgene). Clones were
selected with Neomycin for approximately 2 weeks and then picked and grown up
individually. Whole cell lysates were made and samples were used for western blotting to
characterize clones.
Luciferase Clones: MIA PaCa-2 or PANC-1 cells were transfected with pGL3.CMV.luc
(Promega). Transfections used Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the manufacturer's protocol.

Immunohistochemistry—Tumors were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and
sectioned for staining. Staining was done as previously described (26) with anti-p-Stat3
(1:100, Abcam), anti-PCNA (1:100, Abcam), and anti-Mcl-1 (1:100, Abcam) per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Combination Index Calculation—Combination index (CI) values were determined for
the combination of Sabutoclax and Minocycline in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Values were
calculated using CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc.) according to the Chou-Talalay
method.
In vivo studies

Subcutaneous Xenograft Studies—5 × 106 MIA PaCa-2 and 3.5 × 106 PANC-1 cells
were used to establish bilateral subcutaneous tumors on the flanks of 8–10 week old male
athymic nude mice. Studies were done as previously described (13). Treatment began when
tumors reached ~100-mm3. Sabutoclax was given at a dose of 1 mg/kg for both studies and
was dissolved in a 10:10:80 solution of 100% ethanol:Cremophor:PBS. Minocycline was
given at a dose of 20 mg/kg and dissolved in PBS. Both drugs were given via IP injection 3
times per week. n = 5 mice/group

negative/K-rasLSL-G12D/p53flox/wt). Tumors were given 1 week to establish before treatment
was initiated. Mice were treated with PBS, 1.5 mg/kg Sabutoclax, 10 mg/kg Minocycline, or
both Sabutoclax and Minocycline. Sabutoclax was dissolved in a 10:10:80 solution of 100%

Results
Sabutoclax inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in PDAC
Multiple PDAC cell lines and two normal pancreatic cell lines were treated with increasing
doses of Sabutoclax and assessed for effects on proliferation. The normal cell lines
displayed little change in cell growth (Fig. 1a–b), while all of the cancer cell lines were

growth inhibited. Interestingly, the sensitivity of the cancer cell lines varied, with some
being very sensitive to Sabutoclax (MIA PaCa-2) and others more resistant (AsPC-1) (Fig.
1a). The ability of Sabutoclax to induce cell death and apoptosis was also evaluated (Fig.
1c–d). Again, MIA PaCa-2 was most sensitive to Sabutoclax. However, despite not showing
a potent cell death phenotype, cells like AsPC-1 still showed profound growth inhibition
following Sabutoclax treatment. Furthermore, Sabutoclax displayed greater growth
inhibitory effects than the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Sabutoclax induces G1-S phase arrest

Author Manuscript

Sabutoclax induces cell death in MIA PaCa-2 cells, without promoting potent cell death in
either AsPC-1 or PANC-1. Despite this, there is still a dramatic reduction in cell growth
after drug treatment. To interrogate the mechanism of growth suppression in these cell lines,
we performed cell cycle analysis (Fig. 2a) (Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). Sabutoclax increased
MIA PaCa-2 subG1 phase after 24 and 48 hours (Fig. 2b), without affecting cell cycle,
which is consistent with our previous data. In PANC-1 and AsPC-1, however, potent G1-S
phase cell cycle arrest was evident. These experiments only evaluated cells up to 48 hours
post-treatment. A second set of experiments also included 72 and 96 hours time points (Fig.
2c) (Supplementary Fig. 2d-e) to determine if longer drug incubations promoted cell cycle
arrest or resulted in a switch to apoptosis. In AsPC-1, the G1-S phase arrest was sustained
throughout all time points evaluated. However, at 72 and 96 hours, PANC-1 showed an
increase in the subG1 population of cells, indicating that there is an initial cell cycle arrest in
these cells that later switches to apoptosis (Fig. 2d). These results emphasize the complexity
of responses observed in PDAC to a single agent, such as Sabutoclax.

Author Manuscript

Evaluation of cell cycle protein markers (Fig. 2e) confirmed decreased Cyclin D1 and
increased p27 expression in AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells. Additionally, there was a dramatic
decrease in levels of phosphorylated Rb (Ser780). This corresponded with the observed G1S phase arrest. Interestingly, while levels of p21 in AsPC-1 cells increased, p21 levels
decreased in PANC-1 cells. This difference may account for the switch from growth arrest
to apoptosis in these cells (27,28).
Sabutoclax synergizes with synthetic tetracycline, Minocycline, in PDAC

Author Manuscript

It is now almost axiomatic that to successfully combat cancer multiple targeting strategies
may be necessary. Cancer cells develop resistance to initially effective treatments and
acquire avoidance mechanisms preventing toxicity. Accordingly, combinatorial approaches
attacking multiple pathways in a cancer cell can increase drug efficacy, reduce toxicity, and
increase the time to resistance. Based on this concept, we sought to identify an agent that
would promote synergy when combined with Sabutoclax. Minocycline, a commonly used
antibiotic, can negatively impact cancer growth and survival (15–19). Despite this, it
paradoxically also protects cells in the face of an insult through inhibition of mitochondrial
apoptosis and upregulation of Bcl-2 (20–22). For these reasons, we hypothesized that these
drugs might work well in combination, given their cancer-selective toxicities as single
agents and the potential of Sabutoclax to counteract the pro-survival effects of Minocycline.

Minocycline is fairly nontoxic to several PDAC cells (MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1), but is
inhibitory in others (AsPC-1 and BxPC-3) (Supplementary Fig. 3). In resistant cells, the
combination of Sabutoclax and Minocycline is very toxic. It significantly reduces cell
proliferation and overall cell number, and induces cell death to a much greater extent than
either agent alone in MIA PaCa-2 (Fig. 3a–d) and PANC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Combination index values also demonstrate synergy between these two compounds
(Supplementary Fig. 5). It also promotes increased apoptosis and reduced colony formation
in PDAC cells. Importantly, this synergistic effect is not evident in the normal cell line,
HPNE (Fig. 3e–g).

Author Manuscript

We next sought to define the mechanism underlying this synergy. The combination of
subtoxic doses of Sabutoclax and Minocycline induced potent cell death that was partially
abrogated by pretreatment with zVAD, indicating that this toxic effect is, in part, caspasemediated. This rescue phenotype is evident in the morphology of treated cells (Fig. 4a;
Supplementary Fig. 4c) and through reductions in LDH activity, indicating lower levels of
cell death (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 4b). Furthermore, PARP cleavage was reduced in
cells pretreated with zVAD (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Fig. 4a). When specific caspases were
evaluated, the combination treatment showed caspase-3 cleavage and loss of full-length
caspase-8, which was not found in zVAD-treated samples.
The cytotoxic effect of Sabutoclax and Minocycline is Stat3-dependent

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Stat3 activation is clinically relevant for PDAC as constitutive activation of Stat3 has been
reported in 30–100% of human tumor specimens, and is crucial for PDAC initiation,
progression, and maintenance (29). Sabutoclax treatment resulted in a potent loss of Stat3
phosphorylation (Tyr 705), as well as a loss of downstream Stat3 targets, such as survivin
(Fig. 4d). Minocycline alone induced similar changes (Fig. 4d). Subtoxic doses of each drug
lowered Stat3 activation, but the combination of both drugs almost completely eliminated
pStat3 expression (Fig. 4e). To determine whether this would affect the cytotoxicity of the
combination, we created MIA PaCa-2 clones stably expressing an activated Stat3 mutant,
Stat3 Y705F, e.g. C 13 (Fig. 4f). As compared to the parental cell line, C 13 showed
enhanced resistance to combination treatment (Fig. 4g). A similar elevated resistance was
observed in other Stat3 Y705F overexpressing MIA PaCa-2 clones (data not shown).
Because pretreatment with zVAD partially rescued cells from Sabutoclax and Minocyclineinduced cell death, we evaluated expression of a variety of caspases to determine their
potential involvement not only in death induced by the combination, but which ones might
be affected in C 13 cells (Figure 4h). In parental MIA PaCa-2 cells, caspases 3, 7, and 8
were cleaved. Loss of full-length caspases 2 and 6 was evident, whereas AIF, caspase 12,
and caspase 10 (caspase 10 data not shown) were not significantly altered. In C 13 cells,
however, we did not see any significant changes in any caspase examined, supporting the
observation that loss of Stat3 activation is necessary for caspase-dependent cell death by
Sabutoclax and Minocycline. We also created stable cell lines overexpressing Stat3 Y705F
in PANC-1 cells. Similar to what we observed in MIA PaCa-2 cells, constitutive Stat3
activation in these clones protected them from cytotoxicity induced by the combination of
Sabutoclax and Minocycline (Supplementary Fig. 6b–c).

Caspase-8 activation is an integral part of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. However, it
can also be activated independent of this pathway by other caspases (30). To determine if
caspase-8 involvement was due to extrinsic pathway activation or downstream intrinsic
pathway activation, we used Z-IETD-FMK to specifically inhibit caspase 8 before drug
treatment. Unlike the pan caspase inhibitor, zVAD, pretreatment with Z-IETD-FMK did not
protect cells from Sabutoclax and Minocycline-induced cell death (Fig. 4i) (Supplementary
Fig. 6a). This indicates that caspase-8 activation is dispensable for Sabutoclax and
Minocycline-induced cell death and is most likely a secondary effect of other caspases.
Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that Sabutoclax and Minocycline induce a
cytotoxic phenotype through activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
Sabutoclax alone reduces tumor growth in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer and
this effect is enhanced with the addition of Minocycline

Author Manuscript

Luciferase-expressing MIA PaCa-2 cells, displaying a similar phenotype as parental cells
(Fig. 5a), were established as subcutaneous xenografts in athymic nude mice and were
treated with Sabutoclax (1 mg/kg), Minocycline (20 mg/kg), or both agents. Minocycline
treatment alone showed minimal effects, while Sabutoclax alone showed greater reductions
in tumor weight and (Fig. 5b–c). Despite this, animals treated with a combination of
Sabutoclax and Minocycline showed a synergistic reduction in tumor growth, with a
significantly smaller tumor growth rate, even as compared to Sabutoclax alone (Fig. 5c).
This was confirmed with bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (Fig. 5d). A similar experiment
was conducted using PANC-1-luc cells resulting in the same trend, with the combination
group showing significant inhibition of tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry of tumor sections (Fig. 5e) demonstrated higher intensity PCNA
staining in control, Sabutoclax, and Minocycline-treated groups as compared to the
combination-treated group. Furthermore, combination-treated tumors showed significantly
less phosphorylated Stat3 expression, consistent with in vitro observations.
Quasi-orthotopic xenograft mouse model
While subcutaneous xenograft studies are useful in evaluating in vitro observations in an in
vivo setting, flank tumors do not accurately mimic natural disease states. To study the effect
of our drugs in a more natural setting, we used a quasi-orthotopic model of PDAC (31). We
found that MIA PaCa-2-luc cells, when injected intraperitoneally, specifically homed to the
pancreas, with the majority of tumors or tumor nodules found in this organ. Other locations
in which we found tumors (liver, peritoneal lining) are common places for this cancer to
metastasize and more closely mimic the clinical picture of this disease.

Author Manuscript

In an initial set of experiments, we injected 1 × 106 cells i.p. and allowed 1 week for tumor
establishment before treating mice with Sabutoclax and Minocycline, alone or in
combination. Consistent with our previous data, Minocycline as a single agent did not have
any effect and mice presented similarly to control animals. Sabutoclax showed a potent
single-agent effect, with fewer animals showing evidence of disease. The combination group
showed even more promise (Fig. 6c), with only 1/7 mice showing tumors by BLI (Fig. 6a–

b). Pancreas weight did not show significant differences, though the trend supported our
other observations (data not shown).
A second quasi-orthotopic study was conducted using similar drug dosing parameters.
Tumors, though, were initiated with the injection of 5 × 106 cells as opposed to 1 × 106. In
our first study, the use of fewer cells allowed testing whether Sabutoclax and Minocycline
could prevent tumor formation. However, the use of fewer cells also means that the overall
tumor burden was less when therapy was initiated, which prevented determining the true
magnitude of the effect Sabutoclax and Minocycline would have in the context of a greater
tumor burden, which might more closely imitate the clinical setting.

Author Manuscript

As anticipated, injecting a greater number of cells resulted in a larger overall tumor burden
in the animals. Mice from all groups developed tumors or tumor nodules in the pancreas.
However, the weight of the pancreas from mice treated with both Sabutoclax and
Minocycline was significantly less than those from animals in all 3 other groups (Fig. 6d).
Sabutoclax and Minocycline in a transgenic mouse model of PDAC (KPC)
The KPC transgenic PDAC mouse model is used frequently in PDAC research (32–36).
This animal spontaneously develops precursor pancreatic lesions, PanINs, which progress
and eventually develop into invasive disease. Tumors form as a result of activated K-ras and
functional loss of p53 in the pancreas, genetic changes also seen in a high percentage of
human tumors. Histological analysis shows extensive local invasion as well as metastasis in
a subset of animals (37).

Author Manuscript

Pancreatic tumors from these mice overexpress Mcl-1 as shown by immunohistochemistry
(Supplementary Fig. 8a). This is consistent with the disease observed in humans (2–5) and
provides a rationale for using Sabutoclax in these animals. Additionally, cell lines derived
from these animals show combination effects with Sabutoclax and Minocycline
(Supplementary Fig. 8b). These cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of control
KPC mice (Pdx-1-Cre-negative/K-rasLSL-G12D/p53flox/wt) and allowed to grow for
approximately one week. Mice were treated with Sabutoclax, Minocycline, or both drugs
every 2–3 days via i.p. injection for a total of 6 injections. Sabutoclax or Minocycline alone
did not significantly affect tumor growth. The combination of drugs, however, significantly
inhibited tumor growth as compared to controls (Fig. 6e). Immunohistochemistry of tumor
sections demonstrated decreased staining for PCNA and pStat3 in combination-treated
tumors (Fig. 6f–g).

Author Manuscript

Additionally, a survival study was done using KPC mice (Pdx-1-Cre/K-rasLSL-G12D/
p53flox/flow) to determine the effects of Sabutoclax and Minocycline. Mice were treated with
Sabutoclax (1 mg/kg), Minocycline (10 mg/kg), or a combination of both three times a week
via i.p. injection starting at around 1 month of age and continuing until animals reached a
moribund state. Mice receiving combination treatment showed a significant survival
advantage as compared to control mice (Fig. 6h). Tumors from these animals were isolated,
sectioned, and stained for pStat3Y705. In correlation with our other studies, tumors from
animals treated with Sabutoclax and Minocycline showed significantly less staining as

compared to control tumors (Supplementary Fig. 9). Importantly, no toxicity was seen from
either drug in any of the animals studies conducted.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers remaining largely untreatable. Moreover,
advances in therapy have been minimal over the last 15 years, due in part to the aggressive
nature of PDAC and the difficulty in developing selective and effective therapeutics. We
presently describe an efficacious novel drug combination for PDAC that uses a new BH3
mimetic and uncovers the hidden therapeutic potential of Minocycline as an anti-cancer
agent. Considering overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in PDAC, we initially
evaluated the efficacy of Sabutoclax, a BH3 mimetic that targets these anti-apoptotic
proteins inhibiting their function. Sabutoclax was effective as a single agent. It induced
cancer-inhibitory effects in multiple genetically diverse PDAC cell lines. Potent apoptosisinducing activity was evident in some PDAC cell lines and in those that only showed minor
increases in death, we found instead a potent cell cycle arrest. Tumor heterogeneity is a
problem manifested to some degree in all cancers, but is especially relevant in PDAC,
contributing to the global resistance seen in this cancer to conventional chemotherapeutics.
A beneficial aspect of Sabutoclax is its anti-cancer activity in multiple PDAC cell lines,
irrespective of genetic background.

Despite the potential of Sabutoclax as a single-agent, there is a pressing need for
combination therapy in the clinical setting. Cancer is an adaptive disease and effectively
combatting it requires a multifaceted approach. Because of this, we sought to find a second
drug that would potentially synergize with Sabutoclax to further promote its clinical
applicability. We focused on the antibiotic, Minocycline, which has a small literature base
supporting a novel role for this drug in the field of cancer (15–19). Despite these reports,
translational cancer research using tetracyclines never expanded as only minor efficacy was
evident with these drugs. In addition to its classical role as an antibiotic, Minocycline has
also been studied extensively as a neuroprotective agent. Zhu, et. al. showed that this
neuroprotection develops, in part, through the inhibition of caspase-9 and caspase-3
activation after exposure to death-inducing stimuli due to the inhibition of cytochrome c
release from mitochondria (22). Minocycline has also been shown to lead to increases in the
expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins like Bcl-2 (20,21). We hypothesized that these
properties might actually mask the true potential of Minocycline as a cancer therapeutic and
contribute to the disappointing results seen in the past. However, we hypothesized that these
properties might make it an ideal combination partner for Sabutoclax. Sabutoclax works by
directly acting at the level of the mitochondria specifically inducing apoptosis driven by
cytochrome c release. In combination with Sabutoclax, the block on apoptosis in cells
treated with Minocycline may be released thereby leading to synergistic anti-cancer
properties.
Our study has shown that Sabutoclax plus Minocycline is exceptionally effective against
pancreatic cancer (Fig. 6i). Subtoxic individual doses of each drug produced a dramatic
synergistic cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we found that this combination resulted in a loss
of Stat3 activation, which was not seen in response to Sabutoclax treatment in non-

tumorigenic LT2 cells (data not shown). This may help to explain the absence of sensitivity
seen in these cells. Reintroduction of a constitutively active Stat3 mutant into cancer cells
rendered them resistant to the combination of Sabutoclax and Minocycline. This
combination shows promise in vivo using multiple mouse models, both immunecompromised and immune-competent transgenic models of PDAC, showing significant anticancer activity without any signs of gross toxicities.

In summary, we describe an innovative combinatorial therapeutic approach with remarkable
activity against pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in three animal PDAC models.
Considering the paucity of effective therapies for PDAC, it is clear that new approaches are
mandatory to impact clinically on this invariably fatal cancer. The ability to target the Bcl-2
family for inactivation, using Sabutoclax, and combining this with a simple synthetic
tetracycline antibiotic, such as Minocycline, opens up new areas of research with the
potential to lead to an effective therapy for pancreatic cancer.
