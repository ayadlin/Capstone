Functional MicroRNA Is Transferred between Glioma Cells

Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are single-stranded 17- to 27-nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate gene expression
by posttranscriptional silencing of target mRNAs. Here, we transformed rat 9L gliosarcoma cells to express celmiR-67, a miRNA that lacks homology in rat. Coculture of these cells with cells that expressed a luciferase
reporter that contained a complementary sequence to cel-miR-67 resulted in significant suppression of luciferase expression. This effect was also observed in the U87-MG human glioma cell line. Moreover, luciferase
suppression was inhibited by the addition of carbenoxolone to cocultures, suggesting that gap junction
communication regulates intercellular transfer of miRNA. Finally, in situ hybridization revealed the presence
of cel-miR-67 in cel-miR-67–null 9L cells after coculture with cel-miR-67–expressing cells. Our data show that
miRNA transcribed in glioma cells can be transferred to adjacent cells and induces targeted inhibition of
protein expression in the acceptor cells. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of targeted intercellular
protein regulation between brain tumor cells. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8259–63. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are single-stranded 17- to 27-nucleotide
RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by posttranscriptional silencing of target mRNAs through complementary
binding (1). Each miRNA can affect a number of mRNAs and,
depending on its targets, has the potential to function as an
oncogene and/or tumor suppressor (2). Recent studies indicate
that some tumors, including gliomas, can secrete microvesicles
that contain RNA, including miRNA (3). Other cells treated
with purified tumor-shed microvesicles take up miRNAs
contained within (3, 4). It has also been shown that cardiac
myocytes exchange RNA in a process mediated by gap junctions (5). However, it is unknown whether miRNA secreted
by tumors, either by microvesicles or otherwise, can regulate
protein expression in neighboring cells by inherent mechanisms. Here, we show that miRNAs transcribed in rat gliosarcoma cells are transferred to adjacent cells and that this
transferred miRNA induces targeted inhibition of protein
expression in the acceptor cells.

American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in 2003, 2007, and
2000, respectively. Cells were resuscitated and cultured in
accordance with ATCC guidelines for less than 4 months before use in these experiments. ATCC performs authentication
of all cell lines through short tandem repeat profiling (human
cells), karyotyping, and cytochrome c oxidase I testing; we
did not reauthenticate these lines in our laboratory. Cells
were maintained at 37°C in DMEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum as previously described (6).
Cell cocultures
Cells were cultured for 24 hours in 96-well plates. 9L cells
were added at 2:1 ratio of C. elegans miRNA-expressing cells
(1.4 × 104) to luciferase-expressing cells (7 × 103). For in situ hybridization experiments, 4 × 104 C. elegans miRNA-expressing
cells were cocultured for 24 hours with 2 × 104 enhanced green
fluorescent protein (eGFP)–expressing cells in eight-well glass
chamber slides.
Cell transfection
Cel-miR-67 pMIR-report luciferase and control plasmids
(Signosis) and cel-miR-67 and cel-miR-239 expression plasmids (GenScript) were used. Transfection was carried out
for 12 hours using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 4 μg
of DNA per transfection. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
cells were washed three times in PBS, collected by trypsinization, and resuspended in culture medium before use in experiments. Stably transfected cells were isolated under puromycin
selection, tested for C. elegans miRNA expression, and subsequently used in experiments. We verified that only 9L-mir67
cells expressed cel-miR-67 using a cel-miR-67 TaqMan miRNA
assay (CT value = 28.7; Applied Biosystems).
Luciferase assays
Luciferase activity was determined using a Luciferase
Assay System kit (Promega). Luminescence was determined

Figure 1. Cel-miR-67–expressing 9L gliosarcoma cells suppress luciferase expression in, and transfer cel-miR-67 to, neighboring cel-miR-67–negative
cells by a gap junction–dependent mechanism. A, luciferase detected in 9L-Luc cells cocultured with 9L cells transfected with an empty expression vector
(9L-mirNeg) or a vector encoding for cel-miR-67 (9L-mir67) or cel-miR-239 (9L-mir239). n = 4, P = 0.004 (ANOVA). B, luciferase detected in 9L-Luc67
cells cocultured with 9L cells stably expressing cel-miR-67 (9L-mir67s), cel-miR-239 (9L-mir239s), or empty expression vector (9L-mirNegs). n = 4,

on a Fusion plate reader (Perkin-Elmer). For all wells, each experimental group (e.g., 9L-miR-67) was the result of one transfection per experiment. Each luciferase experiment was
performed four times, with six or more replicates per group.
Inhibition of gap junctions
To inhibit the function of gap junctions in 9L cells, we incubated the cells with 150 μmol/L carbenoxolone for 7 hours.
Carbenoxolone is a broad-spectrum gap junction antagonist,
and incubation for 7 hours in 150 μmol/L has been shown to
disrupt the function of gap junctions (7).
In situ hybridization and immunostaining
Probes against rno-miR-21 and cel-miR-67 (Exiqon) were
hybridized to miRNAs according to a published protocol
that was modified for adherent cells (8). Cells were counterstained with a monoclonal antibody against eGFP (Aves
Labs). The probe for rno-miR-21 was used as a positive
hybridization control because miR-21 is highly expressed in
gliomas (9).
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as mean ± SD. P values were calculated
using one-way ANOVA or Student's t test.

Results
Cel-miR-67 is not expressed in rat, mouse, or human and,
for this reason, is often used as an inert miRNA negative control in experiments using mammalian cells (10). Using realtime reverse transcription-PCR with a cel-miR-67 specific
primer, we confirmed that 9L rat gliosarcoma cells did not
express cel-miR-67 miRNA.

To test whether functional miRNA can be transferred from
one tumor cell to another, we cocultured 9L cells transfected
with an expression vector for cel-miR-67 (9L-mir67) or
cel-miR-239 (9L-mir239) or an empty expression vector (9LmirNeg), with 9L cells transfected with a luciferase reporter
encoding for mRNA with a 3′ untranslated region containing
a complementary sequence to cel-miR-67 (9L-Luc67). When
9L-mir67 cells were cocultured for 24 hours with 9L-Luc67
cells, we observed a 25% signal attenuation compared with
the 9L-mirNeg control group. However, when 9L-mir239 cells
were cocultured with 9L-Luc67 cells, luminescence was not
significantly altered compared with 9L-mirNeg/9L-Luc67
control. The luciferase activity detected in the 9L-mir67/9LLuc67 coculture cells was also significantly less than that detected in the 9L-mir239/9L-Luc67 group (Fig. 1A). These data
show that the downregulation of luciferase in the 9L-Luc67
cells was due to the presence of cel-miR-67, produced by the
9L-mir67 cells with which they were cocultured.
We next posited that intercellular regulation of luciferase
might be dependent on the expression of cel-miR-67 DNA
that had not incorporated into the genome. To test this hypothesis, we established, through puromycin selection, 9L
cell lines that stably expressed either cel-miR-67 (9L-mir67s)
or cel-miR-239 (9L-mir239s). We then cocultured these
puromycin-resistant 9L-mir67s– or 9L-mir239s–expressing
cells with 9L-Luc67 cells. Similar to our results using cells
that were transfected 24 hours prior, when 9L-mir67s cells
were cocultured with 9L-Luc67 cells, we observed a 13% signal attenuation compared with the 9L-mir239s/9L-Luc67
control group (Fig. 1B). These data show that cells that
have incorporated cel-miR-67 into their genome downregulate luciferase expression in 9L-Luc67 cells when cultured
together.

Functional MicroRNA Is Transferred between Glioma Cells

As mentioned above, there is evidence that transfer of RNA
between cardiac myocytes occurs and that it is mediated by
gap junctions (5). To determine if transfer of functional miRNA between brain tumor cells is regulated by gap junctions,
we inhibited them by incubating the cells with carbenoxolone, a broad-spectrum connexin channel antagonist. The
addition of carbenoxolone to 9L cocultures significantly
blocked the effect of cel-miR-67–expressing cells on luciferase expression in Luc67-expressing cells (Fig. 1C). These

findings indicate that gap junction intercellular communication significantly mediates the transfer of functional miRNA
between 9L cells.
To confirm that cel-miR-67 was present in cocultured 9L
acceptor cells that did not express cel-mir67, we cocultured
9L-mir67s cells with 9L gliosarcoma cells that express eGFP
(9L-eGFP). We used in situ hybridization to visualize celmiR-67. We observed colocalized green fluorescent protein
(GFP) and cel-miR-67 signals in 9L-mir67/9L-eGFP coculture

Figure 3. U87-MG human glioma cells expressing cel-miR-67 suppress luciferase expression in neighboring cel-miR-67–negative cells, but U251 cells
expressing cel-miR-67 do not. A, luciferase detected in U87-Luc cells cocultured with U87-MG cells transfected with an empty expression vector
(U87-mirNeg) or a vector encoding for cel-miR-67 (U87-mir67) or cel-miR-239 (U87-mir239). n = 5, P = 0.003 (ANOVA). B, luciferase detected in U251-Luc
cells cocultured with U251 cells transfected with an empty expression vector (U251-mirNeg) or a vector encoding for cel-miR-67 (U251-mir67) or
cel-miR-239 (U251-mir239). n = 5, P = 0.903 (ANOVA). Bars, SD. Post hoc multiple comparisons are two-tailed t tests.

(∼75% of GFP-reactive cells were positive for cel-miR-67), but
no cel-miR-67 in 9L-mir239/9L-eGFP controls (Fig. 2A–D).
These results confirmed the presence of cel-miR-67 in 9LeGFP acceptor cells. Thus, 9L gliosarcoma cells can transfer
functional miRNA between cells, and this miRNA can regulate protein expression in the acceptor cells.
Finally, we tested whether miRNA could be transferred between other glioma cells. To this end, we transfected the human glioma cell lines U87-MG and U251 with the cel-mir67,
cel-mir239, or Luc67 plasmid and performed the same coculture experiment. Here, we found that luciferase expression in
the U87-MG cells was significantly reduced by coculture with
cel-miR-67–expressing U87-MG cells (U87-mir67); however, no
effect was observed in the U251 cocultures (Fig. 3A and B).
These results indicate that miRNA transfer may occur in human as well as rat glioma cells; however, a lack of luciferase
suppression in the U251 cocultures suggests that miRNA transfer may not occur or may be limited in some glioma cell types.

Discussion
Alterations in the expression of miRNA contribute to the
pathogenesis of human cancers (11). Dysregulation of miRNAs promotes malignancy of glioblastoma and contributes
to cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis and glioma
stem cell multipotency and survival (12, 13). Intercellular
transfer of RNA was hypothesized as early as 1971 (14). Recent evidence indicates that gliomas can shed microvesicles
that contain functional miRNAs, mRNAs, and receptors
(3, 15). These microvesicles have been detected in biological
fluids including blood, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid (3, 16).
Proteins, RNAs, and miRNAs transported by microvesicles
are now believed to play a critical role in tumor invasion
and metastases (17). Previous studies showed that cells

8262

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

exposed to tumor-shed microvesicles take up and incorporate proteins and nucleic acids contained within (3, 4, 15).
These prior experiments provided compelling evidence that
intercellular protein regulation through transferred miRNA is
possible, if not likely. However, using a vector encoding for
alien miRNA, we provide direct evidence that gliosarcomas
exchange functional miRNA, and importantly, that this transferred miRNA leads to significant alterations in protein
expression in the acceptor cells.
Previously, Valiunas and colleagues showed that oligonucleotides the size of siRNA are permeable to gap junctions
(18). More recently, it was shown that cardiac myocytes
exchange small RNAs through a gap junction–dependent
mechanism (5). These studies are important because they
suggest a route of intercellular RNA transfer independent
of microvesicles. Our findings indicate that gap junctions mediate the transfer of miRNA between 9L cells. However, it remains to be determined whether miRNAs are transported
through these intercellular channels directly or if gap junctions influence processes such as microvesicle release. It is
also possible that carbenoxolone affects mechanisms other
than gap junctions, and future experiments targeting specific
connexins with siRNA could test for this.
An obvious next step will be to determine if tumors can
manipulate protein expression in neighboring nontumor
cells, which, if true, may contribute to recruitment or transformation of nontumor cells. Interestingly, miRNA transfer
either does not occur in U251 cells or elicits an effect below
the sensitivity of our assay. This finding raises the possibility
that intercellular miRNA transfer varies between glioma cell
types. Of note, it has been reported that connexin 43 is highly
expressed in cultured U87-MG cells, but not in U251 cells
(19). As gap junctions contribute to miRNA transfer, it would
be interesting to test if the difference we observed was due to

the differential connexin 43 expression between the two cell
lines. Furthermore, we have not established whether cell-tocell contact is necessary for miRNA transfer or effective
suppression of protein expression in the acceptor cells. Nevertheless, this study shows direct and targeted regulation
of protein expression between brain tumor cells. These findings have wide-ranging implications for our understanding of
tumorigenesis and progression, as well as for the development of miRNA-based antitumor therapies.
