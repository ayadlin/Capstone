Abstract
Carbonic anhydrase XII (CA XII) is a membrane-tethered cell surface enzyme that is highly expressed on many
human tumor cells. Carbonic anhydrase members in this class of exofacial molecules facilitate tumor metabolism
by facilitating CO2 venting and intracellular pH regulation. Accordingly, inhibition of exofacial CAs has
been proposed as a general therapeutic strategy to target cancer. The recent characterization of 6A10, the ﬁrst
CA XII-speciﬁc inhibitory monoclonal antibody, offered an opportunity to evaluate this strategy with regard to CA
XII-mediated catalysis. Using functional assays, we showed that 6A10 inhibited exofacial CA activity in CA XIIexpressing cancer cells. 6A10 reduced spheroid growth in vitro under culture conditions where CA XII was active
(i.e., alkaline pH) and where its catalytic activity was likely rate-limiting (i.e., restricted extracellular HCO3
supply). These in vitro results argued that the antibody exerted its growth-retarding effect by acting on the
catalytic process, rather than on antigen binding per se. Notably, when administered in a mouse xenograft model
of human cancer, 6A10 exerted a signiﬁcant delay on tumor outgrowth. These results corroborate the notion that
exofacial CA is critical for cancer cell physiology and they establish the immunotherapeutic efﬁcacy of targeting
CA XII using an inhibitory antibody. Cancer Res; 73(21); 6494–503. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Carbonic anhydrase XII (CA XII) is, alongside a related
isoform IX, a cancer-associated, membrane-tethered exofacial
enzyme. Early evidence has suggested that CA XII expression is
upregulated under hypoxic conditions (1, 2), akin to CA IX. In
contrast to CA IX, CA XII is upregulated by estrogen and
therefore present in many breast cancers (3). More generally,
the enzyme is overexpressed in many forms of human cancer,
including renal, pancreatic, gut, oral, brain, lung, and ovarian
(2, 4–11), but is also present in some normal tissues, such as
kidney, gut, and endometrium (4, 6, 12), expressed in combination with other carbonic anhydrase isoforms. CA XII has also
been found to be overexpressed in glaucoma (13) and in
advanced atherosclerotic plaques (14). The enzyme is successfully used as a serodiagnostic biomarker for lung cancer (15)
and as a molecular marker for the detection of breast cancer
lymph node metastasis (16).

Despite considerable progress made, the molecular biology
and physiology of CA XII is less well understood than that of CA
IX. Like CA IX, CA XII is a catalyst for CO2 hydration (17, 18).
Cancer cells produce vast quantities of this metabolic endproduct by mitochondrial and pentose shunt decarboxylation,
and by titration reactions between acids (e.g., lactic) and
bicarbonate (HCO3; refs. 19, 20). The catalytic activity of
exofacial carbonic anhydrases has been shown to facilitate
CO2 venting from cells (21, 22), optimize extracellular buffering
power to reduce extracellular pH (pHe) transients during acid/
base membrane transport (23), and to supply extracellular
HCO3 (24) for HCO3-dependent pH-regulating transporter
proteins (e.g., Naþ-HCO3 cotransport). These carbonic anhydrase-dependent processes are important for controlling intracellular pH (pHi), which must be regulated to within narrow
limits that are permissive for biological functions. The challenge of regulating pHi is particularly apparent in tumors,
which are characterized by an elevated metabolic rate and
aberrant capillary perfusion (20). It has therefore been hypothesized that the cancer-associated carbonic anhydrases (isoforms IX and XII) play an important role in disease progression.
In agreement with the notion that cancer progression selects
for phenotype, not genotype (25), pH may play a critical role as
a selection pressure driving stable adaptive changes (26, 27).
Aside from impairing pHi regulation, inhibition or knockdown
of CA IX or CA XII have been shown to suppress tumor growth
and migration (17, 28–30). Consequently, the targeting of
cancer-associated exofacial CAs is now being considered as
a novel anticancer therapeutic strategy.
The recent characterization of an anti-CA XII monoclonal
antibody (6A10) with full inhibitory potency against CA XII (31)

CA XII Inhibiting Antibody

has made it possible to study the effects of CA XII-speciﬁc
inhibition on tumor growth. Functional assays have conﬁrmed
that 6A10 inhibits recombinant CA XII at low nanomolar
concentrations and that blocking of CA XII interferes with the
growth of multicellular tumor spheroids in vitro (32). The
present study conﬁrms the inhibitory effect of 6A10 on native
CA XII expressed in intact cells, and shows that inhibition of CA
XII activity slows the growth rate of cancer cells in culture and
in xenograft mouse models. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the antibody's signiﬁcant antitumor activity and highlight the potential of immunotherapy in the treatment of CA XII-expressing
cancers.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies, cell lines, and cell culture methods
6A10 is a rat IgG2a monoclonal antibody that has been
described elsewhere (31). The isotype control antibody used in
the in vivo studies is a rat IgG2a antibody speciﬁc for Glutathione-S-transferase. A549 (ATCC CCL-185), Kato III (ATCC
HTB-103), T47D, and HT29 (ATCC HTB-38) are cell lines
established from a human lung, gastric, ductal breast and
colon cancer, respectively. HT29-shCA9 and HT29-shEV were
a kind gift from A. McIntyre (Oxford University, Oxford, UK)
and were described in detail elsewhere (28). Cells were grown
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(Sigma), Glutamine–Penicillin–Streptomycin mixture (Sigma)
and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 enriched air. Cell lines were
obtained from ATCC and were identiﬁed April 2013 by STR
DNA testing conducted at Euroﬁns.
To simulate hypoxia before immunoﬂuorescence, cells were
incubated with 1 mmol/L dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), a
cell permeable, competitive inhibitor of HIF-prolyl hydroxylases, for 48 hours. Control cells were treated with the drugvehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) only. Before pHe-imaging
experiments, intact A549 and T47D cells were incubated for 24
hours with 20 mg/mL 6A10 to block extracellular-facing CA XII
activity or with PBS (control conditions); before pHi-imaging
experiments, spheroids were grown for up to 6 days in the
presence of 20 mg/mL 6A10.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were plated on a cover slip in a 35 mm Petri dish, grown
to 100% conﬂuency, then ﬁxed using 1 mL of pre-cooled
methanol (20 C) for 10 minutes at 4 C. Antigen blocking
was conducted with a 1% bovine serum albumin and PBS
solution for 30 minutes. Subsequently, cells were incubated
with the primary rat monoclonal antibody 6A10 for 1 hour at
37 C. The sample was then washed with PBS and 0.2% Tween20 four times, for 10 minutes each time. Thereafter, cells were
incubated with the secondary goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488
antibody (green), diluted by 1:1,000 in blocking solution for 1
hour at 37 C. To simulate hypoxia cells were treated with 1
mmol/L DMOG for 48 hours. Control cells were treated with
DMSO for 48 hours to simulate dense normoxic cells. Cells
were imaged with a Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope
(LSM) 700 system.

Immunoprecipitation of CA XII
Eight micrograms of the anti-CA XII antibody 6A10 was
mixed with 200 mL of protein-L agarose beads in 1 mL PBS and
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The beads were
washed with PBS thrice, centrifuged for 2 minutes each, then
halved. The anti-6A10 rat monoclonal antibody was added to
either DMSO or DMOG A549 cell lysates, each 500 mL, and the
bead–antibody mixtures were incubated on a shaker overnight
at 4 C. Both samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20
seconds. The lysates were removed, and each sample washed
thrice with PBS and centrifuged for 2 minutes each time. Fortyﬁve microliters of Laemmli loading buffer containing b-mercaptoethanol were added and samples boiled at 100 C for 5
minutes. The samples were then centrifuged and loaded into
lanes to conduct polyacrylamide electrophoresis and Western
blot analysis.
Western blotting
A549 and T47D cells were lysed at 4 C with buffer containing
in (mmol/L): 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 Substitute,
NaCl (150), NaF (50), Tris-HCl (50), at pH 7.5, and Complete
protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysed cell fragments were pelleted
at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 C. Proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membrane. Antigen blocking was conducted overnight at 4 C
with 5% skimmed milk in PBS and 0.2% Nonidet P-40.
The relevant proteins were detected using the following
primary antibodies: with goat polyclonal anti-CA XII (R&D
Biosystems) antibody; monoclonal mouse M75 antibody raised
against human CA IX; and polyclonal rabbit antibody raised
against CA II (both kind gifts from Prof. S. Pastorekova, Slovak
Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia), polyclonal goat
antibody raised against actin (Santa Cruz). The primary incubation of membranes was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies; both for 1
hour on a shaker at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL, Pierce) was used to visualize protein expression,
and the membranes developed on X-ray ﬁlm (Fuji). Acquired
data were normalized to actin.
Preparation of A549/T47D membrane fragments
Carbonic anhydrase activity was determined from membrane fragments extracted from A549 and T47D cells grown
to 90% to 100% conﬂuency. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS
and scraped down into ice-cold buffer containing in (mmol/L):
NaCl (15), KCl (35), potassium gluconate (105), HEPES (20), MES
(20), Complete protease inhibitors (Roche), pH adjusted to 7.8
at room temperature. Cells in suspension were then disrupted
by freeze-thaw cycle and centrifuged at 9,000 rpm at 4 C to
pellet the membrane fraction, which was then resuspended in
fresh buffer. The centrifugation and buffer-replacement process
was conducted twice to prevent contamination of cell membrane solution with cytosolic carbonic anhydrase isoforms.
Measurement of carbonic anhydrase activity in the
membrane fraction of lysed cells
A 0.67 mL aliquot of membrane-fragment suspension was
added to a 2 mL vessel, well stirred, and cooled to 2 C. A narrow

pH electrode (Biotrode) was inserted to monitor solution pH at
1 Hz. To start the carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed reaction, a 0.33
mL aliquot of 100% CO2 saturated water (2 C) was added to the
vessel. CO2 hydration yielded Hþ ions, which could be measured with the pH electrode. Cooling was necessary to bring the
reaction kinetics within the resolving power of the pH electrode. The hydration rate constant was derived from the pH
time-course using a ﬁtting algorithm developed previously (22).
To determine the spontaneous CO2 hydration rate, measurements were conducted on membrane-free "blank buffer" samples and also in samples treated with 100 mmol/L acetazolamide. The increase in CO2 hydration rate above the spontaneous rate is a measure of carbonic anhydrase catalysis (22).
Solutions
Solutions contained (in mmol/L): CO2/HCO3 buffered
normal Tyrode (NT): NaCl (130), KCl (4.5), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (1),
NaHCO3 (12), glucose (11). For ammonium-containing NT,
NaCl was substituted with NH4Cl. Solutions were bubbled
with 5% CO2/95% air to attain a pH of 7.2.
Live cell imaging of pH
Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 700 with a transparent
superfusion chamber (capacity 2 mL), the surface of which was
pretreated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine to facilitate cell/spheroid
adhesion. Solutions were heated to 37 C and delivered at a
constant rate of 2 mL/min. Downstream suction was adjusted
to maintain a steady-state solution volume of approximately
0.5 mL. Cells were exposed for 3 minutes to medium containing
50 mmol/L WGA-ﬂuorescein (Invitrogen), a membrane-tagging
dye that reports pH at the extracellular surface of the cell, near
the site of CA XII catalysis (21). The dye was excited alternately
at 405 and 488 nm and ﬂuorescent emission detected at 520 
20 nm. The ratio of ﬂuorescence excited at 405 and 488 nm was
later calibrated using highly buffered solutions (10 mmol/L
HEPES, 10 mmol/L MES, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 4.5 mmol/L KCl, 10
mmol/L glucose, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L CaCl2) at pH 6.8
and 7.4.
Statistical analysis of data
SE bars are shown for all data. Data from the measurement
of spontaneous CO2 hydration rates in membrane fraction
were assessed using a two-tailed t test and considered to be
signiﬁcantly different when P < 0.05. In vitro data were assessed
using paired two-tailed t tests and considered to be signiﬁcant
when P < 0.05.
Multicellular spheroids
Spheroids were cultivated as hanging drops. Eight thousand
cells in 20 mL DMEM with the 6A10 or an isotype antibody at a
ﬁnal concentration of 20 mg/mL were pipetted onto the inner
side of the lid of a cell culture dish. The lid was quickly reversed
and placed onto the dish containing PBS to avoid desiccations
and incubated at 37 C. Cell proliferation was calculated with
MTT assays.
Immunocytochemistry
Excised xenografts were cryopreserved and cut into 4 mm
sections, stained with a Cy3- or ﬂuorescein isothiocynate-

coupled goat anti-rat secondary antibody and imaged using
a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope.
Xenograft studies
NSG mice (NOD/SCID/IL2 receptor gamma chain knockout) mice were obtained form Jackson Laboratory and housed
at the animal facility of the Helmholtz Center Munich and
experiments were carried out under a license from the State of
Bavaria. A549 human lung cancer cells were transduced with a
vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped lentivirus
encoding GFP and Gaussia luciferase (LUC) essentially as
described elsewhere (33). Cells expressing the highest GFP
levels were isolated using a Becton Dickinson Aria III cell sorter
and ampliﬁed, yielding a homogenous population with respect
to GFP expression (Supplementary Fig. S1). A549/GFP/LUC
cells were counted, resuspended in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and 100,000 cells per mouse in a ﬁnal volume of
200 mL HBSS were injected intraperitoneally. The data shown
here are representative of three independent experiments. In
an earlier experiment, mice were injected with different doses
of antibodies (10–500 mg) and 100 mg/mL 6A10 was determined
of the lowest dose showing an antitumor effect. For the
experiments described herein and starting from day 0 of
injection, mice were treated with either 100 mg 6A10 or an
anti-GST isotype antibody once per week or left untreated (n ¼
8 for each group). No antibody-related toxicity was observed,
that is, body weight, habitus, and behavior were normal and
identical to animals of the untreated group. Also macroscopic
post mortem inspection did not reveal any indication for
antibody-related tissue and organ damage. Tumor growth
rates were monitored by longitudinal measurements of whole
body bioluminescence signals (photons/second) using an IVIS
Lumina II Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences) as described
(33). Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with isoﬂuorane and ﬁxed
in the imaging chamber. One hundred micrograms of coelenterazine (Synchem) was then injected into the tail vein and
animals were immediately imaged for 15 seconds using a ﬁeld
of view of 12.5 cm with open emission ﬁlter settings, binning at
8 and f/stop at 1. Quantiﬁcation was conducted with the Living
Image software 4.2 (Caliper). Survival curves were calculated
using Mantel-Cox tests.

Results
6A10 inhibits CA activity at the membrane of CA XII
expressing A549 and T47D cells
Previous studies have shown an inhibitory effect of 6A10
on recombinant CA XII (inhibitory constant IC50 ¼ 5.7
nmol/L; 31), the ﬁrst anti-CA XII monoclonal antibody with
biologic activity on its target enzyme. Conﬁrmation of this
inhibitory effect was tested on CA XII expressed natively by
A549 and T47D cell lines. Western blotting showed that both
cell lines express CA XII protein under normoxic incubation
and following 48-hour treatment with the hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF)-stabilizing drug dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG; 1
mmol/L) to induce hypoxic responses (Fig. 1A). In addition, CA
IX expression was also detected in A549 cells (Fig. 1A). Immunoprecipitation of CA XII protein from A549 whole-cell lysates

reaction was initiated by adding 100% CO2-saturated water to
buffered suspensions (20 mmol/L HEPES þ 20 mmol/L MES;
pH 8.0 at 4 C) containing cell membrane fragments (1:2 v/v).
The rate of the Hþ-yielding CO2 hydration reaction (monitored
by measuring medium pH with an electrode) is related to
carbonic anhydrase activity (Fig. 1D, i). The pH dependence of
the hydration rate constant (kh) was determined by piecewise
ﬁtting to the recorded pH time course. Results of the best-ﬁt
(Fig. 1D, ii) indicate that the membrane-bound carbonic
anhydrase activity is pH-insensitive over the range 6.7–7.7.
The addition of 6A10 reduced carbonic anhydrase catalysis in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D, iii) towards the spontaneous
rate (conﬁrmed by experiments in the presence of the broadspectrum carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, 100
mmol/L). The IC50 of 6A10 measured in A549 membrane
fragments was 0.96 mg/mL, and therefore 10 mg/mL was
deemed to inhibit CA XII fully (Fig. 1D, iii). 6A10 (30 mg/mL)
did not affect measured carbonic anhydrase activity in the
strongly CA IX-positive breast line MDA-MB-468 (97  13% of
control activity; ref. 23), establishing that 6A10 does not crossreact with this other exofacial carbonic anhydrase. The nearfull inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity in A549 membrane fragments with 6A10 indicates that endogenous CA IX
activity in this cell line does not contribute signiﬁcantly
towards total membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase catalysis, despite CA IX immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A). This was
conﬁrmed by the absence of any inhibitory effect of the
anti-CA IX antibody MSC8 (which blocks up to 57% of CA IX
activity in CA IX-overexpressing cell lines; Fig. 1D, iv; ref. 34).
Results of the assay are summarized in Fig. 1D, iv (A549 cells)
and Fig. 1D, v (T47D cells). Per gram of total protein, membrane
fragments had higher carbonic anhydrase activity than the
soluble fraction in both cell lines and 10 mg/mL 6A10 potently
inhibited membrane carbonic anhydrase activity.
Further characterization of 6A10 was conducted on intact
cells, loaded with the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugate
of ﬂuorescein, a pH-sensitive ﬂuorescent dye. WGA-ﬂuorescein
reported extracellular pH, close to the site of CA XII activity.
Cells were superfused with solutions buffered by 5% CO2/12
mmol/L HCO3 at pH ¼ 7.2. Rapid exposure to and subsequent
withdrawal of 20 mmol/L ammonium-containing solution by
means of solution-switching evoked surface-pHe transients:
exposure to ammonium evoked transmembrane NH3 entry
and extracellular NH4þ deprotonation at the extracellular
membrane surface (producing a fall in pHe), whereas ammonium removal evoked the reverse reaction (rise in pHe). The
ability of extracellular CO2/HCO3 to buffer these surface-pHe
transients depends on exofacial carbonic anhydrase activity.
Out-of-equilibrium surface-pHe transients were signiﬁcantly
larger in the presence of acetazolamide (Fig. 1E and F) in both
T47D and A549 cells, conﬁrming that both cell lines have
considerable extracellular-facing carbonic anhydrase activity.
Experiments were repeated on cells pretreated with 20 mg/mL
6A10 for 24 hours. Surface-pHe transients were larger and no
longer affected by treatment with acetazolamide, indicating
that 6A10 had inhibited exofacial carbonic anhydrase activity
(Fig. 1E and F). Overall, these data show that the 6A10 antibody
is a highly potent, full inhibitor of exofacial CA XII catalytic

activity in A549 and T47D cells natively expressing the protein.
In A549 cells, which express both CA IX and CA XII protein, the
latter is the major contributor to total extracellular-facing
carbonic anhydrase activity.
6A10 inhibits cancer cell growth
The effect of CA XII inhibition on the growth of CA XIIpositive cells (A549 and Kato III) was measured using the MTT
assay. The starting concentration of HCO3 was varied, at
constant CO2 partial pressure, to alter the time-course of
medium [HCO3] and pH over a 3-day growth period (whereby
higher medium [HCO3] is associated with more alkaline pH,
under the constraints of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation).
Growth of A549 cells was reduced in the presence of 6A10 (Fig.
2A). This effect was greater with lower starting [HCO3], i.e.,
under conditions were HCO3 availability is reduced throughout the growth period, relative to high-starting [HCO3] controls. The HCO3-dependence of the 6A10 effect was more
pronounced in Kato III cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicate
that 6A10 has a signiﬁcant inhibitory effect on growth in vitro,
which is more pronounced when cells are grown in media with
lower starting [HCO3]
Many cell lines and cancers in vivo coexpress CA XII along
with the exofacial isoform CA IX, raising the possibility that CA
XII-speciﬁc inhibition could be compensated by intact CA IX
activity. This was tested by comparing the effect of CA XII
inhibition with 6A10 on CA IX-positive and CA IX-negative
cells. Experiments were carried out on the HT29 colon cancer
cell line, which expresses both carbonic anhydrase isozymes.
The effects of 6A10 were studied on subclones transduced with
either an expression vector carrying a short-hairpin RNA
against CA IX (HT29-shCA9) or an empty control vector
(HT29-shEV; ref. 30). Cells transduced with shCA9 RNA displayed no detectable CA IX expression even under hypoxia,
whereas the enzyme was evident in HT29-shEV cells (Fig. 2C).
Immunoblotting (Fig. 2C) and ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 2D)
revealed that knockdown of CA IX had no effect on CA XII
expression. HT29-shCA9 and HT29-shEV cells were grown
under hypoxia (1% O2) for 3 days in the presence of 6A10 or
an isotype control antibody. Inhibition of CA XII activity with
6A10 signiﬁcantly reduced the growth of CA IX-negative HT29shCA9 in media containing 44 mmol/L bicarbonate and in
bicarbonate-free HEPES-buffered medium (Fig. 2E). In contrast, no inhibitory effects were observed with HT29-shEV cells
(Fig. 2F), indicating that the carbonic anhydrase activity conferred by CA XII in HT29 cells is adequate to maintain normal
growth under hypoxia. This observation supports the notion of
a critical role of CA XII catalysis in facilitating growth, which in
turn could be targeted efﬁcaciously with 6A10.
6A10 inhibits tumor cell growth in a pH-dependent
manner
The catalytic process mediated by CA XII is strongly inhibited by acidic pH substantially lower than 7.0 (35). If the
catalytic process were critical for the effects of 6A10 on growth,
the efﬁcacy of the antibody would show pH dependence. To
assess this in vitro, CA XII-expressing A549 cells were grown as

CA XII Inhibiting Antibody

Figure 2. 6A10 interferes with the
growth of tumor cells. A549 cells (A)
and Kato III (B) cells were grown in
standard medium with 44 mmol/L
bicarbonate or in HEPES-buffered
medium without bicarbonate
(0 mmol/L) for 3 days at a constant
CO2 partial pressure of 5%. Over
the course of the experiment,
medium HCO3 and pH
changed, but differences between
experimental conditions persisted.
After 3 days of growth, cell
proliferation was measured in an

media are expected to acidify further due to metabolism. After
3 days of culture, cell growth was assessed by the MTT assay
(36). As shown in Fig. 3, overall growth rates of A549 cells were
strongly pH-dependent, with an optimum under conditions
were starting pH was approximately 7.2. Of interest, cells did
not survive pH values higher than 7.3 in nominally HCO3-free
media (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of 6A10 on cell
growth was observed when cells were grown from a starting pH
of 7.1 and 7.3. In contrast, no such effect was observed in cells
growth from a more acidic starting pH (between 6.2 and 6.8),
that is, under which CA XII catalysis is expected to be inhibited
from the start of the experiment. In other words, antitumoral
efﬁcacy was not seen under conditions where the enzyme had
been inhibited by Hþ ions from the start of incubation. These
data show that CA XII enzyme activity is mandatory for
optimal growth of A549 cells, and that the inhibitory effects
of 6A10 correlate directly with CA XII catalytic activity. It is
noteworthy that the relationship between proliferation and
ambient pH will be acid-shifted relative to the plot of prolif-

anti-CA XII antibody growth-retarding efﬁcacy relies critically
on the antibody's ability to block carbonic anhydrase catalytic
activity.
6A10 shows antitumor activity in a xenograft tumor
model
The effects of CA XII inhibition with 6A10 on tumor growth in
vivo were studied in a human xenograft model using immunocompromised NSG mice. A total of 100,000 A549/GFP/LUC cells
were injected intraperitoneally and xenograft-bearing mice were
treated with 6A10 (100 mg/mouse), and compared with isotypetreated and untreated control mice. 6A10 was well tolerated and
no side effects were observed. First, CA XII expression and 6A10
binding was assessed in established 6A10-treated tumors. As
shown in Fig. 4A, xenografted A549 cells expressed high levels of
membrane CA XII. Staining of tumors from 6A10-treated animals with a rat-speciﬁc secondary antibody alone conﬁrmed
6A10 binding to tumor cells. Interestingly, binding was most

A, A549 cells were seeded in HEPES-buffered, bicarbonatefree cell culture media adjusted to different pH values and incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 over the course of 3 days; media became gradually

prominent at the tumor margins but was also evident in
intratumoral regions (Fig. 4B), Binding of 6A10 to tumors was
also detected in vivo using 6A10 labeled with the infrared dye 800
CW (Supplementary Fig. S2). Representative hematoxylin/eosin
stains of excised tumors are shown in the Supplementary Fig. S4.
In the next series of experiments, mice were injected with
A549/GFP/LUC cells as described above and xenograft-bearing
animals were treated with 6A10 or an isotype control antibody
once per week (100 mg/mouse) or left untreated. The xenograft
growth rate was monitored weekly by longitudinal measurement of whole body bioluminescence. The bioluminescence
data of day 81 postinoculation are shown exemplarily in Fig. 5A
and the calculated data are presented in Supplementary Fig. S3.
These measurements revealed that 6A10 treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the xenograft growth rate over time as compared
with the isotype antibody, which had no protective effect (Fig.
5B). Consequently, 6A10-treated animals reached a tumor

burden of 2  108 light units approximately 20 days later
(Fig. 5C) and had a signiﬁcantly extended overall survival time
(Fig. 5D). Post mortem inspections (not shown) showed that
tumors had spread mainly to the kidney, the liver, and the
spleen. Because immune effector activities are essentially
absent in NSG mice (37), the observed antitumor activity of
6A10 is solely attributable to the direct inhibition of CA XII
activity. Taken together, inhibition of CA XII with 6A10 had a
signiﬁcant antitumor effect in vivo.

Discussion
A characteristic feature of the elevated metabolic activity of
tumor cells is the generation of ATP by constitutive glycolysis,
intracellular accumulation of lactic acid, and, consequently,
the ensuing challenge of protecting cells from excessive intracellular acidiﬁcation. The aforementioned pH-challenge is
exacerbated by typically inadequate blood perfusion delivered

HCO3 for membrane transporters. Collectively, isoforms such
as CA IX and CA XII play an important role in pH control, and
inhibition of these exofacial carbonic anhydrases would disturb the pH balance in expressing tumors. As pH is a key
phenotypic variable of the tumor chemical milieu, believed to
exert selection pressure and drive disease progression, any
manipulation of pH may change the trajectory of cancer
disease (25). Consequently, targeting cancer metabolism by
interfering with pH regulation is nowadays considered a
promising therapeutic approach (38).
Our investigation shows the efﬁcacy of the CA XII-inhibiting
monoclonal antibody, 6A10, in reducing growth of cancer cells
in vitro and in xenograft tumor models in vivo. Our results
provide evidence that CA XII optimizes tumor cell growth (Fig.
2), but only under conditions where the enzyme is expected to
be catalytically active, that is, when the pH at the start of
incubation was sufﬁciently alkaline to allow the carbonic
anhydrase catalytic process to persist during the growth period
when media gradually acidify (Fig. 3). As evident particularly in
CA XII-positive Kato III cells, the growth-retarding effect of
6A10 was particularly strong when starting growth conditions
had low HCO3 and hence low pH, i.e., characteristic of the
acidic tumor milieu (23). The catalytic activity of CA XII seems
to be more resistant to inhibition at low pH compared with CA
IX, as CA XII activity was unaffected over the range 6.7 to 7.7,
whereas CAIX is half-inhibited when pH falls to 6.8 (28). Thus,
the relative contribution of CA IX and CA XII to total membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase catalysis will depend
strongly on ambient pH. Under conditions of limiting
HCO3 supply and low extracellular pH, exofacial carbonic
anhydrase activity may be essential for tumor physiology and
growth. Inhibition of the membrane-tethered carbonic anhydrases IX and/or XII may result in an antitumor effect arising
from inadequate control of intracellular pH caused by insufﬁcient HCO3 provision and slow pH-buffering by CO2/HCO3.
Support for this hypothesis comes from our xenograft model of
lung cancer grown in NSG mice. In this experiment, 6A10 had a
substantial growth-inhibiting effect in vivo (Fig. 5). The growthdelaying effect of CA XII inhibition is consistent with the role
that exofacial carbonic anhydrase isoforms play in facilitating
the venting of cellular acid. Intact CA XII activity normally
allows for facilitated CO2 diffusion, resulting in apparently
smaller diffusional delays for CO2 removal, allowing tumors to
attain larger volumes. NSG mice are heavily immunocompromised and show no detectable activities of the adaptive and
innate immune system. Consequently, it is unlikely that effector functions like antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or

complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity would have contributed towards the observed antitumor activity of 6A10.
Instead, the effect of the antibody on xenograft growth is most
likely linked to CA XII inhibition.
Although a signiﬁcant antitumor effect of 6A10 was
observed in vivo, our in vitro obtained with HT29 cells, endogenously expressing both CA IX and CA XII, argue for a degree of
redundancy between exofacial carbonic anhydrase isoforms.
Because CA IX and XII coexpression is found in at least some
tumor cells (2, 8, 10, 39, 40), and in line with results obtained by
Chiche and colleagues (17), it is tempting to speculate that the
concurrent and selective inhibition of both enzymes would
result in an improved and additive antitumor effect. As hypoxia
is already evident in non-vascularized micrometastases, there
would also be mileage in investigating whether CA XII inhibition could also impair metastasis formation.
The results presented herein show that inhibition of CA XII
catalysis can substantially interfere with tumor growth,
highlighting this enzyme as a promising target for novel
immunotherapeutic approaches, also in conjunction with CA
IX-targeted therapy.
