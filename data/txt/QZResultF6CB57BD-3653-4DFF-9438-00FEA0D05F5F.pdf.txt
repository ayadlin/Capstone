Abstract
Here we show the antimyeloma cytotoxicity of adaphostin and
carried out expression profiling of adaphostin-treated multiple myeloma (MM) cells to identify its molecular targets.
Surprisingly, c-Jun was the most up-regulated gene even at the
earliest point of analysis (2 h). We also observed adaphostininduced c-Abl cleavage in immunoblot analysis. Proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib, but not melphalan or dexamethasone,
induced similar effects, indicating unique agent-dependent
mechanisms. Using caspase inhibitors, as well as caspaseresistant mutants of c-Abl (TM-c-Abl and D565A-Abl), we then
showed that c-Abl cleavage in MM cells requires caspase
activity. Importantly, both overexpression of the c-Abl fragment or c-Jun and knockdown of c-Abl and c-Jun expression
by small interfering RNA confirmed that adaphostin-induced
c-Jun up-regulation triggers downstream caspase-mediated
c-Abl cleavage, inhibition of MM cell growth, and induction of
apoptosis. Finally, our data suggest that this mechanism may
not only be restricted to MM but may also be important in a
broad range of malignancies including erythroleukemia and
solid tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(4):1680–8]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common blood
cancer in adults, is characterized by bone marrow plasmacytosis,
monoclonal protein in blood and/or urine, bone lesions, renal
compromise, and immunodeficiency. Despite recent advances in
our understanding of disease pathogenesis and treatment, median
overall survival of MM remains at only 3 to 5 years. The
identification and validation of targets for novel therapeutic
regimens is therefore urgently needed.
The tyrophostin adaphostin (NSC 680410), first identified as an
alternative to the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative imatinib
mesylate (1), achieved responses in patients with chronic
myelocytic leukemia (CML), including Bcr-Abl–positive, Bcr-Abl–
negative, and Bcr-Abl T315I mutant tumor cells resistant to both

imatinib mesylate and second-generation BMS354825 and
AMN107. It also shows cytotoxicity against chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cells (2–8).
In contrast to imatinib mesylate, adaphostin induces significantly
greater apoptosis at IC50 of 5 to 10 Amol/L, associated with
significant inhibition of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation (5). Several
mechanisms have been proposed as a basis for its robust antitumor
activity including generation and release of reactive oxygen species,
cytochrome c, and apoptosis-inhibiting factor; caspase cleavage;
c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation; as well as inactivation
of Raf-1, signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat)-3,
and Stat5 (6, 7, 9). As these adaphostin-targeted pathways are
relevant to MM pathogenesis (10), we here sought to determine the
potential molecular sequelae and therapeutic promise of adaphostin in MM. Our present study shows that adaphostin treatment of
MM cells causes marked and acute up-regulation of c-Jun. c-Jun is a
central component of the activating protein-1 family of transcription factors, which consist of homodimers or heterodimers with
either Fos (v-Fos, c-Fos, FosB, FosL1, and FosL2) or activating
transcription factor. In addition, c-Jun also interacts with Stat3 and
p53, molecules that play an important role in MM pathogenesis.
Although mechanisms regulating the transcriptional activity of
c-Jun have been investigated in great detail, its exact role in
mediating cell differentiation, growth, survival, and apoptosis is not
fully understood (11, 12). Importantly, proapoptotic functions of
c-Jun have been reported in neurons, fibroblasts, and endothelial
cells, suggesting that cell death is induced both indirectly through
its transcriptional regulation of survival/death genes (e.g., Fas
ligand) and directly via activation of the caspase cascade, resulting
in the cleavage of numerous molecules [e.g., fodrin, poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), DNA-dependent protein kinase, and
protein kinase C; refs. 13–16]. To date, however, the role of c-Jun in
mediating growth inhibition or apoptosis in MM cells is unknown.
c-Abl (140 kDa) was originally identified as the cellular
homologue of the transforming gene of Abelson murine leukemia
virus and encodes a ubiquitously expressed nonreceptor tyrosine
kinase similar to the Src family of tyrosine kinases. c-Abl has been
linked to diverse cellular processes including DNA replication,
recombination, and repair, as well as cell cycle and cell survival
control. As for c-Jun, the regulation of the diverse activities of
c-Abl is controlled at the levels of c-Abl phosphorylation and its
interactions with a variety of proteins, including retinoblastoma 1,
ataxia telangiectasia mutated, p73, breast cancer 1, RNA polymerase II, Rad51, protein kinase C, DNA-dependent protein kinase, and
p53 (17–19). Although the oncogenic potential of the Bcr-Abl
hybrid protein (210 kDa) has been extensively studied in CML, the

pathophysiologic relevance of aberrant c-Abl activity in other
diseases is less well studied (19). Specifically, c-Abl is expressed in
many MM cell lines including MM.1S, MM144, and interleukin 6
(IL-6)–dependent XG-6 MM (20, 21); moreover, c-Abl overexpression together with c-Myc and Bcl-XL can promote MM in mice (22).
On the other hand, c-Abl may play only a minor role in MM
pathogenesis because tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Abl in MM
cells is low (21) and imatinib mesylate was inactive in a phase II
clinical trial in patients with refractory/relapsed MM (23). Whether
adaphostin mediates its anti-MM activity via c-Abl is not yet
studied.
In this study, we show that adaphostin exhibits robust anti-MM
cytotoxicity against MM cells in both cell culture and bone marrow
microenvironment models. These biological activities are associated with a new molecular mechanism in which c-Jun upregulation triggers caspase-mediated c-Abl cleavage, and the
resultant cleaved 60-kDa c-Abl product both inhibits MM growth
and induces cell death. As for adaphostin, proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib triggers these molecular sequelae, which also occur in
leukemic cells. These studies not only delineate a novel mechanism
of tumor cell cytotoxicity triggered by adaphostin and bortezomib
but also provide the preclinical framework to initiate design of
clinical trials.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Adaphostin (NSC 680410), the adamatyl ester analogue of
tyrophostin AG957, was kindly provided by the Drug Synthesis and
Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National
Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). Anti–c-Abl monoclonal antibody was
obtained from Dr. Ravi Salgia (University of Chicago Hospitals, Chicago, IL)
and anti–phospho-tyrosine (4G10) monoclonal antibody from Dr. T.
Roberts (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Antibodies directed
against actin, caspase-8, caspase-9, phospho-c-Jun, phospho-JNK, and PARP
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); c-Jun,
extracellular signal–regulated kinase-2 (ERK2), and caspase inhibitors
z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), z-IETD-fmk, and z-LEDHfmk were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).
Cells and cell culture. All human MM [MM.1S, MM.1R, RPMI, RPMIDox40 (Dox40), OPM2, U266] cell lines, primary patient MM cells, CML line
K562, and erythroleukemia cell line HEL were cultured in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Harlan,
Indianapolis, IN), 100 units/mL penicillin, 10 g/mL streptomycin, and
2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Cellgro, Herndon, VA). INA-6 cells were cultured in
20% heat-inactivated FBS (Harlan), 100 units/mL penicillin, 10 g/mL
streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Cellgro) with 2 ng/mL
recombinant human IL-6. Before stimulation with IL-6 and insulin-like
growth factor-I, MM cells were incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 with 2%
FBS, followed by an additional 3 h in RPMI 1640 without FBS.
Isolation of patient’s tumor cells. After appropriate informed consent,
MM patient cells (96% CD38+CD45RA ) were obtained from patient
bone marrow samples as previously described. The purity of MM cells was
95% (24).
DNA synthesis and cell proliferation assay. Cell growth was assessed
by measuring [3H]thymidine uptake, as in prior studies (24).
Microarray assay. Total RNA was isolated from adaphostin-pretreated
or untreated MM.1S cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Affymetrix U133A 2.0 arrays were hybridized with biotinylated in vitro
transcription products (10 g/chip), per manufacturer’s instructions, within
the DFCI Microarray Core Facility. The DNA chips were then analyzed with
a Gene Array Scanner (Affymetrix). CEL files were obtained using Affymetrix
Microarray Suite 5.0 software. The DNA Chip Analyzer (DChip; ref. 25) was
used to normalize all CEL files to a baseline array with overall median
intensity, and the model-based expression (perfect match minus mismatch)
was used to compute the expression values. Probes showing at least 1.5-fold

difference between control and adaphostin-treated cells at 2, 6, and
12 h were included in the analysis. The same data were also analyzed
through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems). Cell
viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, was 85% in all adaphostintreated cells during the times indicated.
Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting. Cell lysis,
immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis were done as previously
described (24).
DNA fragmentation assay. Cell Death Detection ELISAplus (Roche
Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) was used to quantitate DNA fragmentation per manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasmids and transfections. Wild-type pSGT-Abl-wt, pSGT-Abl-D565A,
and pcDNA3-Abl-TM (pcDNA3-Abl-D565A-D644A-D958A) were constructed
as previously described (26, 27). All mutations were confirmed by
sequencing. For c-Jun– and c-Abl–specific knockdown experiments,
MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with indicated amounts of small
interfering RNA (siRNA) SMARTpool for c-Jun, c-Abl, or nonspecific control
duplexes (pool of four; Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions/Dharmacon RNA
Technologies, Lafayette, CO) using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V Solution
(Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany).
Annexin/propidium iodide stain. MM.1S cells were treated with either
vehicle or adaphostin for 24 and 48 h, washed with PBS, and evaluated for
dual Annexin V and propidium iodide staining by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis.
Isobologram analysis. The interaction between pazopanib and IMiDs
(Lenalidomide and Actimid), bortezomib, or melphalan was analyzed using
the CalcuSyn software program (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO), which is based on
the Chou-Talalay method. When combination index (CI) = 1, this equation
represents the conservation isobologram and indicates additive effects.
CI < 1 indicates synergism; CI > 1 indicates antagonism.

Results
Adaphostin inhibits growth of MM cells. The therapeutic
potential of adaphostin has been shown in AML, CML, and CLL
(3, 4, 6, 7). To ascertain whether the antineoplastic activities of
adaphostin extend to MM, we first evaluated its effect on
proliferation in a panel of MM cell lines. Adaphostin treatment
induced dose-dependent growth inhibition in dexamethasonesensitive MM.1S, dexamethasone-resistant MM.1R and RPMI 8226,
and doxorubicin-sensitive RPMI (Dox40), OPM1, and OPM2 MM
cell lines (Fig. 1A). In contrast, treatment with adaphostin induced
only minor changes in the growth of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (5).
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) enhance growth, survival,
and drug resistance of MM cells mediated via direct MM cellstromal cell contact as well as via growth factors, cytokines, and
chemokines (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-6). Our
results show that adaphostin treatment also inhibits proliferation
of MM cells adherent to BMSCs in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1B).
Adaphostin induces c-Jun up-regulation and c-Abl cleavage.
Adaphostin is significantly less effective than imatinib mesylate at
inhibiting Bcr-Abl activity in vitro (5). As noted above, multiple
biochemical activities seem to underlie the antineoplastic activities
of adaphostin. In an attempt to delineate adaphostin-responsive
pathways in MM, serial expression profiles were obtained in MM.1S
cells after treatment for 2, 6, and 12 h. Among genes that showed
z2-fold changes in expression level after 6 and 12 h of treatment,
192 genes were up-regulated and only 27 were down-regulated
(Supplementary Table S1). Analysis with the Ingenuity software (28)
showed seven pathways with a score of >1 (range, 13–23; see
Materials and Methods; Fig. 1C, and data not shown); importantly,
four of these cascades converged on the transcription factor c-Jun,

suggesting its central role in response of MM cells to adaphostin
(Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1). Indeed, c-Jun exhibited an
early 13-fold increase at 2 h and its expression level increased
(>100-fold increase) thereafter. Immunoblot assays confirmed that
c-Jun protein up-regulation was also triggered by adaphostin in a
dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B). JunD and
CDKN1C exhibited 4- and 16-fold increased expression, respectively, whereas JunB, Fos, and other Fos family members were not
altered (Fig. 1 and data not shown).

Because adaphostin was developed as an alternative to imatinib
mesylate, we next evaluated its effects on c-Abl in MM cells.
Consistent with previous reports, c-Abl was strongly expressed in
MM.1R, RPMI, RPMI-Dox40, OPM1, and OPM2 MM cells (Supplementary Fig. S2; see refs. 20, 21). Adaphostin triggered cleavage
of c-Abl in MM cells, evidenced by immunoblot analysis of both
whole-cell lysates (Fig. 2A and B) and immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C).
Moreover, adaphostin induced marked changes in the tyrosine
phosphorylation of several proteins including JNK, with only minor

MM.1S cells were preincubated with caspase-8, caspase-9, or pan-caspase inhibitors, followed by treatment with adaphostin. Immunoblot analysis was done with
the indicated antibodies. B, c-Abl cleavage induces inhibition of MM cell growth. MM.1S cells transfected with wild-type c-Abl (c-Abl-wt), c-Abl mutated at D565
(c-Abl-D565A), or c-Abl mutated in all caspase cleavage sites (TM-Abl) were treated with adaphostin, followed by either immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies
(top ) or assay for [3H]dT uptake (bottom ). C, depletion of c-Abl protects against adaphostin-induced inhibition of MM cell growth. MM.1S cells were transiently
transfected with mock (200 nmol/L) and c-Abl siRNA (indicated concentrations) and treated with adaphostin, followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies
(top ) or assay for [3H]dT uptake (bottom ). D, c-Abl fragment (cAbl-D565) markedly down-regulates MM cell proliferation and induces MM apoptosis. MM.1S cells
were transiently transfected with wt-cAbl or cAbl-D565 followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies (top ) or assay for [3H]dT uptake (middle ) or
DNA fragmentation (bottom ).

or no changes in c-Abl (145 kDa) phosphorylation (Fig. 2A and C),
as well as cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-9, and PARP (Fig. 2B). MM
cell apoptosis was confirmed both by Annexin V/propidium iodide
staining (Fig. 2D) and DNA fragmentation assays in both MM.1S
and primary patient MM cells (data not shown). Similar results
were shown in MM.1R, OPM1, OPM2, RPMI, and RPMI-Dox40
(Dox40) MM cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together,
these data show that adaphostin-induced inhibition of MM cell
growth and survival is associated with c-Jun up-regulation and
cleavage of c-Abl.
Bortezomib, but not imatinib mesylate, melphalan, and
dexamethasone, triggers c-Abl cleavage. To assess the specificity
of these adaphostin-induced molecular effects in MM, we next
tested melphalan and dexamethasone conventional MM chemotherapeutics, as well as the novel proteasome inhibitor bortezomib,
for their ability to trigger up-regulation of c-Jun and cleavage of
c-Abl. Unlike adaphostin, imatinib mesylate, melphalan, and
dexamethasone did not induce c-Jun up-regulation or c-Abl
cleavage. Importantly, bortezomib, similar to adaphostin, induced
both c-Jun up-regulation and c-Abl cleavage (Fig. 3A). This
observation is consistent with reports that the proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 triggers c-Abl cleavage and cell death in both

suspension and adherent solid tumor cells (29). The effect of
adaphostin combined with bortezomib, melphalan, or dexamethasone in BMSC-MM cell cocultures was next evaluated. Importantly, isobologram analysis showed that adaphostin and low-dose
bortezomib induces marked synergistic effects on MM cell growth
(Fig. 3B and C). In contrast, no additional cytotoxicity was
observed with adaphostin combined with melphalan or dexamethasone (data not shown).
Caspase-dependent cleavage of c-Abl and its functional effect
in MM cells. The antiproliferative and proapoptotic functions of
c-Abl have previously been described in human lymphoid cells
(17, 18, 27) via caspase-dependent cleavage at D565, D644, and D958
(27, 30). Moreover, the 60-kDa fragment generated by cleavage at
the c-Abl residue D565 is the only cleavage product detectable
after longer periods of caspase activation (30). We next sought to
determine whether caspases mediate adaphostin-triggered cleavage
of c-Abl in MM cells. We therefore incubated MM cells with
caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk), caspase-9 inhibitor (z-LEDHfmk), as well as pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), before
exposure to adaphostin and then monitored for c-Jun expression
and c-Abl cleavage. Whereas c-Jun up-regulation was unaffected,
c-Abl cleavage was partially reduced by inhibition of caspase-8

and caspase-9 and nearly completely abrogated by pan-caspase
inhibition (Fig. 4A). Taken together, these data show that
adaphostin activates caspases, which in turn cleave c-Abl
predominantly at D565, thereby generating a 60-kDa fragment
in MM cells.
c-Abl cleavage by adaphostin inhibits MM cell growth. To
correlate adaphostin-triggered c-Abl cleavage with alterations in
MM cell growth and survival, we next transiently transfected MM
cells with wild-type c-Abl or with c-Abl mutants, which harbor AspAla substitutions at one (D565) or all three caspase cleavage sites
(TM; refs. 27). Transfection efficacy was validated by immunoblot
analysis. Adaphostin-triggered c-Abl cleavage is abrogated in MM
cells transfected with either c-Abl-D565A or c-Abl-TM, but not with
wild-type c-Abl. In contrast, adaphostin-induced up-regulation of
c-Jun expression was not affected (Fig. 4B, top). Moreover, the
sensitivity to adaphostin was significantly reduced in MM cells
transfected with c-Abl-D565A and c-Abl-TM compared with wildtype c-Abl (Fig. 4B, bottom).
To further show the pivotal role of c-Abl cleavage in inhibiting
MM cell growth, MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with
c-Abl siRNA before treatment with adaphostin. As shown in
Fig. 4C, protein expression of both uncleaved and cleaved c-Abl
was markedly down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner
compared with cells transfected with mock siRNA. c-Abl–specific
down-regulation was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies against actin (Fig. 4C) and ERK2 (data not shown).
Adaphostin-induced up-regulation of c-Jun was unchanged,
providing further evidence of its role upstream of c-Abl.
Importantly, adaphostin-induced JNK phosphorylation in MM
cells was inhibited upon c-Abl depletion, showing a pivotal role
for the c-Abl fragment mediating JNK activation. These data are
consistent with previous studies in other cell models, in which

c-Abl cleavage leads to JNK activation (31, 32), as well as with our
own studies showing marked JNK activation in MM cells triggered
by bortezomib (33, 34). Conversely, depletion of c-Abl by specific
siRNA protected against adaphostin-induced inhibition of MM
cell proliferation (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these data, transient
transfection with c-Abl fragment cAbl-D565, but not with wt-cAbl,
significantly down-regulated thymidine uptake (Fig. 4D, middle)
and increased DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4D, bottom), as in
adaphostin-treated MM cells (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data
strongly indicate that cleavage of c-Abl contributes to the
cytotoxicity of adaphostin in MM cells.
Depletion of c-Jun inhibits adaphostin-induced c-Abl
cleavage and decreases MM cell growth. The requirement for
c-Jun up-regulation in caspase-mediated cleavage of c-Abl was
next investigated. MM cells transiently transfected with c-Jun
siRNA were treated with adaphostin and examined for c-Abl
cleavage, as well as associated effects on MM cell growth. As
shown in Fig. 5A, both adaphostin-induced up-regulation of c-Jun
expression and c-Abl cleavage were markedly inhibited upon
c-Jun depletion. Specific down-regulation of c-Jun was validated
by immunoblotting with antibodies against actin (Fig. 5A) and
ERK2 (data not shown). Importantly, the sensitivity of MM cells to
adaphostin was markedly decreased, as evidenced by [3H]dT
uptake (Fig. 5A). Consistent with these data, transient transfection with wt-cJun, but not with the empty vector (pCDNA3),
markedly down-regulated MM cell proliferation (Fig. 5B, top) and
increased DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5B, bottom), as in adaphostintreated MM cells. Similar results were obtained using Annexin V
staining and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay (data not shown). Taken
together, these data indicate that up-regulation of c-Jun
expression initiates caspase activation and subsequent c-Abl

cleavage, MM growth inhibition, and apoptosis (Fig. 5C).
Additional mechanisms that may contribute to c-Jun–induced
tumor cell death are under active investigation, including caspasetriggered cleavage of proteins other than c-Abl and differential
regulation of death-preventing versus death-enhancing members
of the Bcl-2 gene family (13).
Adaphostin induces similar effects in imatinib mesylate–
resistant erythroleukemia cells. We next examined whether
similar effects were observed in settings other than myeloma.
Remarkably, this mechanism also contributes to adaphostintriggered growth inhibition and apoptosis in the CML cell line
K562 (Bcr-Abl expressing) and the erythroleukemia cell line HEL
(Jak2V617F expressing; Fig. 6A) because treatment of both cell
lines with adaphostin triggered up-regulation of c-Jun and c-Abl, as
well as PARP cleavage. These effects were somewhat diminished in
imatinib-sensitive, Bcr-Abl–positive K562 cells, in which one c-Abl
allele is lost to the Bcr-Abl fusion (data not shown). Importantly,
adaphostin, but not imatinib mesylate, induced dose-dependent
inhibition of HEL cell growth (Fig. 6B). Given our results suggesting
that c-Jun up-regulation induces cell growth inhibition and
apoptosis in MM cells, we did Oncomine analysis (35) of 13 tumor
data sets representing a broad spectrum of tumor types. Nine of

these tumors, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, show
significantly lower levels of c-Jun expression in tumor cells versus
normal cellular counterparts (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The present study shows a role for c-Jun–induced caspase
activation and associated c-Abl cleavage in the inhibition of MM
cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Functional sequelae of
c-Jun up-regulation were investigated using adaphostin, a compound
originally investigated as an alternative to the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative imatinib mesylate. These studies identify a novel
mechanism whereby c-Jun modulates MM cell growth and also
provide a preclinical rationale for use of adaphostin, alone and in
combination, to augment MM cell cytotoxicity and improve patient
outcome.
c-Jun not only induces cell growth and oncogenic transformation
(11, 12) but may also mediate cell death either by acting as a
transcriptional regulator or by triggering caspase-mediated cleavage
of proteins. Potential explanations for its opposing effects include
cell type specificity, the availability of external and internal survival
factors, and specific spectra of binding partners. In addition to the

c-Jun and c-Abl in Multiple Myeloma

above data, our recent studies show a trend toward a shorter overall
survival and event-free survival in 11 of 67 (17%) MM patients with
low levels of c-Jun compared with patients with normal or high levels
of c-Jun (36). Taken together, these data suggest that low c-Jun
expression may correlate with poor survival, which requires
validation in larger studies. They also suggest that adaphostin and
bortezomib, by increasing c-Jun expression and inducing apoptosis,
may be particularly useful in this subset of patients.
c-Abl has been associated with DNA replication, recombination,
repair, G1 growth arrest, and apoptosis (19); as for c-Jun, phosphorylated protein-protein interactions are implicated in the
regulation and function of c-Abl (18). c-Abl activity is reported to
play only a minor role in MM pathogenesis because tyrosine
phosphorylation of c-Abl in MM cells is low and unaffected by
treatment with imatinib mesylate (21). Moreover, a phase II trial
of imatinib mesylate in patients with refractory/relapsed MM
showed little activity (23). However, our studies show that cleavage
of c-Abl inhibits MM cell growth and induces apoptosis of MM
cells both alone and in the bone marrow microenvironment.
These effects are predominantly mediated via up-regulation of cJun, followed by cleavage of c-Abl. Importantly, after caspasetriggered cleavage, c-Abl products are regulated by ubiquitination
and the proteasome (29). The marked synergistic effects of
adaphostin and bortezomib observed in our study may, at least in
part, be due to the inhibition of degradation of ubiquitinated
proteins and the stabilization of cleaved c-Abl. Consistent with our
data, the combination of adaphostin with the investigational
proteasome inhibitor MG-132, as well as with bortezomib, is
strongly synergistic in a variety of leukemia cell lines (8).
Importantly, c-Abl also neutralizes the inhibitory effect of murine
double minute-2 on p53 (37), whereas bortezomib induces upregulation of p53 by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
(33). Therefore, complex formation of c-Abl with p53 (17) may be
another mechanism to induce synergistic effects on G1 arrest in
MM cells.
Our data both highlight significant differences in the mode of
action of adaphostin versus imatinib mesylate and provide the
framework for combined therapy to induce synergistic cytotoxicity
in multiple human leukemia cell lines (38). Specifically, we suggest
that c-Abl cleavage may contribute to adaphostin-triggered effects
in CML cells, consistent with previous studies reporting a decrease
of p210 Bcr-Abl after adaphostin treatment. Our data strongly
suggest that decreased p210 Bcr-Abl expression in these studies is
associated with an increase of c-Abl cleavage products. Moreover,
reactive oxygen species generation is one of the initial events
mediating adaphostin-induced death in CML cells, and adaphostininduced oxidative injury of leukemic cells activates caspases,
thereby amplifying this cell death process (7, 8). Adaphostin
induces significantly greater CML cell apoptosis with less
inhibition of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation than imatinib mesylate,
consistent with this view (5).

Ongoing studies are delineating the downstream molecular
mechanisms mediating the antiproliferative and proapoptotic
functions of c-Abl in MM. It is possible that c-Abl–induced JNK
phosphorylation triggers the translocation of JNK to mitochondria, initiates the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO,
and thereby triggers mitochondrial death signaling cascades
(39). We are also testing whether protein interaction of cleaved
c-Abl with retinoblastoma 1, ataxia telangiectasia mutated, p73,
breast cancer 1, RNA polymerase II, Rad51, protein kinase C,
DNA-dependent protein kinase, or p53 (17–19) contributes to
adaphostin- and/or bortezomib-induced inhibition of MM cell
growth and apoptosis.
Besides specific protein-protein interactions, the cellular localization of both full-length c-Abl and caspase-induced c-Abl
fragments may play a crucial role in defining specific functions of
c-Abl. Specifically, the first caspase-induced cleavage of c-Abl at
Asp958 generates 120- and 22-kDa fragments; the second cleavage of
the 120-kDa fragment at Asp565 generates a 60-kDa fragment. The
120-kDa fragment loses the nuclear exclusion signal and the actinbinding domain, whereas the 60-kDa c-Abl fragment retains the
SH3, SH2, and kinase domains and loses both the nuclear
localization and nuclear export signals, as well as the DNA- and
actin-binding regions (27, 30). Our data indicate that the major 60kDa c-Abl fragment is responsible for the antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects in MM cells; our ongoing studies are
investigating the functional relevance of its subcellular localization
in MM.
The present report therefore shows for the first time that c-Jun
up-regulation (triggered by bortezomib or adaphostin) activates
caspases in MM cells, which generate a 60-kDa c-Abl product,
which in turn induces cell growth arrest and/or apoptotic cell
death. It delineates a novel mechanism of bortezomib- and
adaphostin-induced MM cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.
Importantly, our data suggest that this mechanism may be
operative not only in MM but also in other malignancies including
CML and solid tumors, thereby providing the preclinical rationale
for use of adaphostin, both alone and in combination, to improve
patient outcome.
