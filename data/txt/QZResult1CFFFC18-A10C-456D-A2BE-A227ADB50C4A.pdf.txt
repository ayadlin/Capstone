ABSTRACT
Solar ultraviolet (SUV) irradiation causes skin disorders such as inflammation,
photoaging, and carcinogenesis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a key role in SUVinduced skin inflammation, and targeting COX-2 may be a strategy to prevent skin
disorders. In this study, we found that the expression of COX-2, phosphorylation of
p38 or JNKs were increased in human solar dermatitis tissues and SUV-irradiated
human skin keratinocyte HaCaT cells and mouse epidermal JB6 Cl41 cells. Knocking
down COX-2 inhibited the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the phosphorylation
of p38 or JNKs in SUV-irradiated cells, which indicated that COX-2 is not only the
key enzyme for PGs synthesis, but also an upstream regulator of p38 or JNKs after
SUV irradiation. The virtual ligand screening assay was used to search for natural
drugs in the Chinese Medicine Database, and indicated that salidroside might be
a COX-2 inhibitor. Molecule modeling indicated that salidroside can directly bind
with COX-2, which was proved by in vitro pull-down binding assay. Ex vivo studies
showed that salidroside has no toxicity to cells, and inhibits the production of PGE2,
phosphorylation of p38 or JNKs, and secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) caused by SUV irradiation. In vivo studies demonstrated
that salidroside attenuates the skin inflammation induced by SUV. In brief, our data
provided the evidences for the protective role of salidroside against SUV-induced
inflammation by targeting COX-2, and salidroside might be a promising drug for the
treatment of SUV-induced skin inflammation.

UVB [5, 6]. Consequently, these kinases activate their
downstream transcription factors, such as nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κB) and (AP-1). Finally, pro-inflammatory
factors, such as cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukins
(IL-1, IL-6, et al), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
are produced. The skin inflammation also precedes
photoaging and carcinogenesis. Thus anti-inflammation is
an important strategy in SUV induced skin disorders.
Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting
enzyme in the production of prostaglandins (PGs) from

INTRODUCTION
Excessive exposure to solar UV (SUV) is
associated with numerous human skin disorders, such
as skin inflammation, photoaging, and carcinogenesis
[1–3]. SUV comprises approximately 95% UVA and 5%
UVB. Exposure to UV is known to induce clustering of
some kinds of cell-surface receptors and to transducer
intracellular signals [4]. UVA activates p38 and JNKs,
while p38 is the primary signaling pathway activated by

arachidonic acid (AA) [2]. There are two major isoforms
of COX, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is normally
constitutively expressed, but COX-2 is inducible by many
stimuli including SUV [7]. Increased level of COX-2
induced by SUV irradiation causes inflammation, cell
proliferation, tumor promotion and angiogenesis [8, 9].
COX-2 inhibition prevents skin inflammation, aging
and carcinogenesis, representing a potential strategy for
preventing solar UV related skin disorders. Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs have been widely used to reduce
PGs and COX-2 expression. Previous studies showed
that COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib suppress UVBinduced skin inflammation and tumor formation [10].
A number of COX-2 inhibitors have been developed,
but most of them are restricted due to the different risk
factors [11–13]. For example, nonselective nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (ns-NSAIDs) inhibit both COX1 and COX-2, which exhibit significant gastric-intestinal
(GI) toxicity, such as development of gastric ulcers and
gastrointestinal bleeding. Large clinical studies identified
an increased risk of developing cardiovascular conditions,
including myocardial infarction and stroke, with the use
of selective COX-2 inhibitors. Therefore, it is necessary to
identify novel and nontoxic COX-2 inhibitors.
Salidroside, p-hydroxyphenethyl-b-D-glucoside,
a phenylpropanoid glycoside is one of the major
components extracted from Rhodiola rosea, a plant with
extensive history as a traditional medicine, particularly
in cultures in the northern latitudes of Europe, Asia,
and North America [14, 15]. In this study, we identified
that salidroside is a novel COX-2 inhibitor by structurebased virtual screening assay, and it exerts potent antiinflammatory effect on SUV-induced skin inflammation
ex vivo and in vivo.

accompanied with elevated COX-2 and activation of
cell signal pathways, such as p38, JNKs [17]. Ki67 was
detected as cell proliferation marker, and CD45 was
detected as an inflammation marker. The results indicated
that the expression of COX-2, phosphorylation of p38 or
JNKs, Ki67 and CD45 were remarkably increased in solar
dermatitis (Figure 1B-1G).

SUV irradiation induces the expression of
COX-2, the phosphorylation of p38 or JNKs in
HaCaT and JB6 Cl41 cells
Human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line and Mouse
epidermal JB6 Cl41 cell line were used as cellular
models to research SUV induced skin inflammation [9].
The levels of COX-2, phosphorylated p38 or JNKs were
examined after SUV irradiation with different doses or
time points. The expression of COX-2 was increased at
15 min after 40 KJ /m2 SUV irradiation in HaCaT cells,
or 60 min after similar SUV irradiation in JB6 Cl41 cells,
respectively (Figure 2A, 2B). In both HaCaT and JB6
Cl41 cells, phosphorylated p38 or JNKs was increased
by SUV irradiation in a dose-dependent manner, and the
increasing effect was up to peak at 5 min after 40 KJ/m2
SUV irradiation (Figure 2C, 2D). These data indicated
that SUV irradiation induced the expression of COX-2,
the phosphorylation of p38 or JNKs in HaCaT or JB6 Cl41
cells, and 40 KJ/m2 SUV was determined for the following
research.

Knocking down COX-2 inhibits SUV-induced
phosphorylation of p38 or JNKs in HaCaT cells
COX-2 is closely related to SUV induced skin
disorders [8, 9]. We detected the effect caused by COX2 in SUV irradiated HaCaT cells by knocking down it.
We set up shMock or shCOX-2(#1-#5) stable cell lines
in HaCaT cells. Compared with control (shMock), the
COX-2 expression and PGE2 production were decreased
dramatically in shCOX-2 #1 and #3 cells (Figure 3A,
3B), which were used for the following study. The
phosphorylation of p38 or JNKs was detected in cells
at 5 min after SUV irradiation. Compared with shMock
cells, the phosphorylated p38, or JNKs was remarkably
decreased in COX-2 knocking down cells. In previous
researches, COX-2 was regarded as the downstream
effectors regulated by p38 or JNKs signal pathways
[2, 9]. Our data suggested that COX-2 might be an
upstream molecule for the activation of p38 or JNKs
signal pathways in the response of SUV irradiation.

RESULTS
The expression of COX-2, phosphorylation of
p38 or JNKs, Ki67 and CD45 are increased in
human solar dermatitis
Previous studies have reported that COX-2 is closely
associated with the SUV induced skin inflammation[8],
p38 activation is the dominant SUV-induced signaling
transduction pathway, and JNKs were activated by both
UVA and UVB[5, 6] . The solar dermatitis, also known
as sunburn, is caused by exposing in SUV. In order to
know pathological changes in solar dermatitis, the cases
of solar dermatitis and normal skin samples were detected.
The pathological features were shown by H&E staining.
Epidermal hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia of epidermis,
furcella extension, the multifocal intercellular edema,
dermal shallow vasodilation, priority with lymphocytes

vessels were observed in solar dermatitis samples (Figure

always used for screening natural and nontoxic drugs.
In this study, structure-based virtual screening was
performed to identify novel COX-2 inhibitors in the
Chinese Medicine Database. We identified salidroside
(Figure 4A), isolated from Rhodiola rosea, as a potential
COX-2 inhibitor based on its high docking score against
COX-2. Molecule modeling indicated that the glycosyl of
salidroside formed hydrogen bonds with COX-2 at amino
acid residues ARG106 and TYR341 (Figure 4B). To
validate the computational prediction, in vitro pull-down
assay was performed, COX-2 was detected in sample
eluted from sepharose 4B beads coupled with salidroside,
but not in eluent from Sepharose 4B beads alone, which
indicated salidroside could directly binds with COX-2
(Figure 4C).
To determine the cytotoxicity of salidroside,
HaCaT and JB6 Cl41 cells were treated with various
concentrations of salidroside (0, 500, 1000, 2000 μM),
and measured by MTS assay at 24, 48, 72 h. The results
indicated that salidroside had no significant cytotoxicity
on HaCaT and JB6 Cl41 cells (Figure 4D). In summary,
salidroside can bind with COX-2 and has no cytotoxicity
to cells.

Since salidroside directly binded with COX-2,
next, we tested how it impacted on the intracellular
COX-2. Firstly, the COX-2 level in salidroside pretreated HaCaT cells or JB6 Cl41 cells was detected.
The result showed that salidroside pre-treatment
(400 μM) for 12 h decreased the COX-2 level at 15
min (for HaCaT cells) or 60 min (for JB6 Cl41 cells)
after irradiated by 40 KJ/m2 SUV (Figure 5A), which
indicated that salidroside could inhibit the SUVinduced COX-2 expression. Secondly, the production
of PGE2 was detected to represent the activity of COX2. Celecoxib, a well-known COX-2 inhibitor, was used
as a positive control. The SUV irradiation-stimulated
PGE2 production was decreased in both HaCaT cells
and JB6 Cl41 cells by salidroside pre-treatment in a
dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 5B), the
COX-2 specific inhibitor Celecoxib treatment showed
the similar reducing effect. Thus, we next investigated
the effect of salidroside on cell signals activated by

SUV. The western blot results indicated that the
phosphorylated of p38 or JNKs was substantially
attenuated in dose- and time-dependent manners after
pre-treatment of salidroside in HaCaT cells (Figure
5C) or JB6 Cl41 cells at 5 min after SUV irradiation
(Figure 5D). The levels of COX-2 has not been
changed at 5 min after SUV exposure, combined with
the previous result that COX-2 might be an upstream
regulator of p38 or JNKs, we concluded that salidroside
inhibited the activity of COX-2 rather than changing its
expression. To confirm whether salidroside suppressed
the inflammation process, the secretion of IL-6 or
TNF-α was measured in HaCaT and JB6 Cl41 cells.
The result indicated that salidroside significantly
inhibited the SUV induced IL-6 or TNF-α releasing
from these cells (Figure 5E). Compared with effect

on the expression of COX-2, salidroside showed more
effective inhibition on the activity of COX-2. Overall,
salidroside pre-treatment inhibited SUV-induced COX2 activation, and in turn inhibited the activation of p38
or JNKs signaling pathway, and prevented the release
of inflammatory factors such as IL-6 or TNF-α.

Salidroside inhibits inflammation induced by
SUV irradiation in vivo
To further investigate anti-inflammatory activity
of salidroside in vivo, it was used for treatment of SUVinduced skin inflammation in mouse model. The H&E
staining results showed that the epidermal thickness
increased significantly with the edema and epithelial cell
proliferation, and infiltration of immunocytes in 100 KJ/

DISCUSSION

m2 SUV irradiated mice (Figure 6A upper panel: middle
column versus left column). While, epidermal thickness
and inflammation caused by SUV irradiation were
suppressed by 50 mg/kg salidroside treatment (Figure
6A upper panel: right column versus middle column).
Since salidroside inhibited the activation of p38 or
JNKs and production of inflammatory factors ex vivo,
the levels of COX-2, phosphorylated of p38 or JNKs
were detected by IHC, and the data indicated that SUV
irradiation dramatically increased the levels of COX-2,
phosphorylated p38 or JNKs, and salidroside treatment
significantly reduced these effects caused by SUV (Figure
6A, 6B). Next, we tested the effect of salidroside on
PGE2, IL-6 or TNF-α produced in mouse skin tissues.
The production of these factors was remarkably increased
in SUV irradiation group, and the increasing effect was
significantly reduced by salidroside treatment (Figure 6B,
C). Taken together, our findings provided evidences that
salidroside suppressed skin inflammation by inhibiting
COX-2 in vivo.

SUV exposure leads to skin inflammation, which
precedes photoaging and carcinogenesis [3]. UVA can
promote photoaging and wrinkling of the skin and have
potent carcinogenic effect [18], While UVB is the major
risk factor for skin diseases including melanoma and
nonmelanoma skin cancers, it can trigger the initiation,
promotion, and progression phases of skin cancer [19, 20].
Both UVA and UVB causes skin inflammation by activating
intracellular signal pathways. COX-2 is induced by p38
or JNKs signaling pathways after SUV irradiation, and
catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandins which not only
promotes the process of inflammation, but also participate
the carcinogenesis of skin [21–23]. So that COX-2 becomes
a therapeutic target of interest for skin disorders. There
are a lot of COX-2 inhibitors used in clinical. However
the side effects of these drugs has been reported [24–27].
For example, a well-known COX-2 specific inhibitor,
celecoxib, has been reported for multiple side effects,

such as cardiovascular risk, acute kidney injury, and acute
pancreatitis[24,28,29]. Beside the efficiency of such COX
inhibitors, people are forced to pay more attention to the
safety of COX-2 inhibitors.
In human solar dermatitis tissue and SUV-irradiated
HaCaT and JB6 Cl41 cells, COX-2 is highly expressed
accompanied with increasing of phosphorylated p38,
or JNKs. After knocking down COX-2, not only
the production of PGE2 in SUV-irradiated cells was
decreased, but also the phosphorylated p38, or JNKs
was attenuated, which indicated the crucial role of
COX-2 in the inflammatory signals caused by SUV,
and COX-2 might be an upstream activator of p38 or

JNKs. COX-2 is regarded as an enzyme and its biological
significance is mainly mediated by the production of
prostaglandins [2]. These inflammatory lipids influence
cellular physiology by different manners, which include
(1) activation of G-protein coupled receptors, (2) inhibition
of inflammation by activating corticosteroid-like receptors,
(3) participation in receptor protein tyrosine kinase signal
transduction [30]. These events might activate p38 or
JNKs directly or indirectly. On the other hand, since the
phosphorylated p38 or JNKs was detected as soon as 5
min after SUV exposure, the intracellular PGs has not
been changes remarkably, we considered that COX-2
might be a upstream signal transductor and regulate the

L for its multiple functions, such as anti-aging, anticancer, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress,
hepatoprotective properties and neuroprotective effect
[31–36]. But the specific molecular target of salidroside
has not been reported. In this study, structure-based
virtual ligand screening was performed to screen a
selective COX-2 inhibitor from Chinese Medicine
Database and identified salidroside might be a COX-2
inhibitor. Molecule modeling indicated that the glycosyl
of salidroside forms hydrogen bonds with COX-2, in
vitro pull-down assay was performed and indicated that
cellular derived COX-2 binds with salidroside directly.
The MTS study determined that salidorside has no
cytotoxicity even the concentration up to 2000 μM and

activation of p38 or JNKs by itself. How does it regulate
the activation of p38 or JNKs? It is still unknown and
needs to be proved by supportive experimental evidences.
Since the side effects of existing COX2 inhibitors, it is necessary to develop new drugs
targeting COX-2. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines
have great therapeutic effects and pharmaceutical
values, and gain more and more interests to search
for natural drugs with high efficacy and low toxicity.
Salidroside, a natural compound extracted Rhodiola
rosea L, which has long been used as a traditional
Tibetan medicine to relieve altitude sickness, other
effects on neuro-protection, cardio-protection, antidepression, anti-fatigue, and anti-tumor have been
reported [14, 15]. Salidroside is thought to be one of
the most effective compounds from Rhodiola rosea

In order to study the effect of salidroside on COX2, we detected how the expression and activity of COX2 in SUV-induced skin inflammation are regulated by
salidroside. In ex vivo studies, salidroside pretreatment
reduced the SUV-induced COX-2 expression in a timedependent manner, the obvious inhibition was observed
at 12 h after SUV exposure in HaCaT cells. But the PGE2
production was reduced as early as 3 h after SUV exposure
in both HaCaT cells and JB6 C141 cells. In SUV-induced
inflammation, the production of PGE2 is increased earlier

than the expression of COX-2, because of the activation
of existing COX-2 by SUV irradiation. We also found
that salidroside pretreatment significantly inhibited the
phosphorylated p38 or JNKs after SUV exposure only for
5 minutes. In that condition, the expression of COX-2 had
not be changed. So we determined that salidroside exerts
its anti-inflammation role by inhibiting the activity of
COX-2 rather than its expression, and the expression of
COX-2 was reduced by salidroside due to the attenuated
p38 or JNKs signals, like the reduced production of IL-6

shown mainly in epidermas of mice skin. B. Quantification of COX-2 expression, phosphorylation levels of p38, or JNKs were analyzed by

and TNF-α. The in vivo study also proved that salidroside
protects skin against the SUV-induced inflammation.
Our study indicated that salidroside inhibited SUVinduced skin inflammation by directly targeting COX-2 in
vitro and in vivo. And we found that COX-2 is not only the
key enzyme for the production of prostaglandins, but also
works as an upstream regulator for p38 or JNKs. However,
the interaction between COX-2 and p38 or JNKs is still
unclear. It is worth noting that salidroside is a naturally
occurring compound with high safety evidenced by the
experimental data [37]. Besides the multiple effects, due to
the good water solubility and low molecular weight (MW:
300.3), salidroside is well speculated that the compound
may penetrate easily from the epidermis to the dermis with
a proper preparation [15]. Overall, Salidroside showed great
potential anti-inflammatory effect and might be a promising
drug for the treatment of SUV-induced skin inflammation.

To estimate cell viability, cells (1000/well) were
seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h, then treated with various
concentrations of salidroside (0, 500, 1000, 2000 μM) for
additional 24, 48, or 72 h. After incubation for various
times, cell viability was measured by an MTS assay kit
(Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Docking & homology modeling
Chinese Medicine Database was used in the virtual
ligand screening, and salidroside was identified as a
novel COX-2 inhibitor based on its docking score against
COX-2. In order to explore the accurate binding model
for the salidroside binding pocket of COX-2, we carried
out molecular docking analysis using the AutoDock
Vina software based on the modeling protein structure.
Homology modeling on COX-2 was performed by
Swiss-Model. Chain A of 3NT1 (PDB ID) was selected
as the template protein from the PDB database. Prior
to docking, a short protein structure optimization was
added to the modeled receptor using AMBER ff99SB
force filed. In docking, hydrogen atoms and charges of
the receptor were added by using AutoDock Tools. The
three-dimensional structure of salidroside was downloaded
from ZINC database. The format of compound structure
was converted to pdbqt format through Applied Chemistry
Software Openbabel. Docking grid was proposed to
enclose the substrate binding site of the protein. Finally,
9 docked poses of the ligand were produced for further
analysis.

200, 400 μM) or celecoxib (1 μM) for 12 h before exposed
to 40 kJ/m2 SUV and further cultured for 18 h. Finally, the
supernatant was collected for detection. PGE2 released into
the medium was measured by the PGE2 EIA kit following
the supplier’s instructions. The released IL-6 or TNF-α
in medium was determined by ELISA kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-6
released in the mouse skin tissues were collected by
homogenization and centrifugation, the supernatant was
measured by EIA kit or ELISA kit as described above.

and for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
immunohistochemistry (IHC). The other samples were
frozen and used for ELISA analysis. All animal studies
were conducted according to the guidelines approved by
the Laboratory Animal Center of Huazhong University of
Science and Technology.

Immunohistochemistry
The human and mouse skin tissue sections (5μm)
were performed antigen retrieval by microwave after
deparaffinization and rehydration for 10 min in sodium
citrate buffer. Then the sections were treated with 3%
H2O2 for 10 min and blocked with 5% goat serum for
1 h at room temperature, then were incubated at 4°C
overnight with primary antibodies as follows: 1:100 anti
COX-2 raised in rabbit, 1:200 anti p-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182)
raised in rabbit (Cell Signaling Technology) and 1:200
anti p-JNKs (Thr183/Tyr185). Then the primary antibody
staining, detection and amplification using a biotinylatedstreptavidin-HRP and DAB system, hematoxylin
counterstaining. Slides were dehydrated through gradient
alcohols to xylene and coverslipped with Permount TM
Mounting Medium. All the slides were analyzed by
Medicine Image Analysis System (MIAS).

Western blot
HaCaT cells (1 × 106) or JB6 Cl41 (2 × 106) were
seeded in 10-cm dishes, cultured for 24 h, and starved for
12 h before SUV irradiation. For studying the effect of
salidroside, the cells were pretreated with salidroside (400
μM) for further 3, 6, 12 h before SUV irradiation. After that
the cells were harvested and disrupted in lysis buffer (150
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mg/mL aprotinin,
10 mg/mL leupeptin, 5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyluoride
(PMSF), 1 mM dithiolthreitol (DTT) containing 1% Triton
X-100, pH7.4) followed by disruption by sonication and
centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The quantity of
protein was determined by the Bradford method. The
samples with 5× SDS loading buffer were heated at 95°C
for 10 minutes, and then cooled on ice. After that, the
samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred
to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
After blocking with 5% non-fat milk or 5% BSA, the
membrane was incubated with a specific primary antibody
at 4°C overnight. After incubated with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody, the protein bands were visualized by
the ECL system (BIO-RAD, USA). All experiments were
repeated at least three times.

Statistical analysis
All quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SEM
as indicated. The t test or one-way ANOVA was used for
statistical analysis. A probability of P< 0.05 was considered
statistically significant (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).

Animal study
Adult Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were purchased
from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(Hubei, China) and kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle at a
controlled temperature with free access to food and tap
water. The mice were divided into three groups: vehicle
group (n=10), vehicle/SUV group (n=10), 50mg/kg
salidroside /SUV group (n=10). The mice were shaved
24 h before experiment. In the vehicle group, the dorsal
skin of mice was smeared with acetone for 3 h. In the
vehicle/SUV group, the dorsal skin of mice was smeared
with acetone for 3 h and then exposed to 100 KJ/m2
SUV. In the 50 mg/kg salidroside /SUV group, 50 mg/
kg salidroside in acetone was smeared to the dorsal skin
for 3 h and mice were exposed to 100 KJ/m2 SUV. The
mice were euthanized and dorsal trunk skin samples were
harvested at 24 h after SUV irradiation. One-half of the
samples were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
