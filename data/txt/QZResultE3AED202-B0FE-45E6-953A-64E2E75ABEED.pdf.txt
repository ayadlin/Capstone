Abstract
Clinical management of pancreatic cancer is a major problem,
which is in part due to both de novo and acquired resistance
to conventional therapeutics. Here, we present in vitro and
in vivo preclinical evidence in support of chemosensitization
of pancreatic cancer cells by 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM), a
natural compound that can be easily obtained by consuming
cruciferous vegetables. DIM pretreatment of pancreatic cancer
cells led to a significantly increased apoptosis (P < 0.01) with
suboptimal concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents
(cisplatin, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin) compared with
monotherapy. It is known that resistance to chemotherapy
in pancreatic cancer is associated with constitutively activated
nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB), which becomes further activated
by chemotherapeutic drugs. Our data provide mechanistic
evidence for the first time showing that DIM potentiates the
killing of pancreatic cancer cells by down-regulation of
constitutive as well as drug-induced activation of NF-KB and
its downstream genes (Bcl-xL, XIAP, cIAP, and survivin). Most
importantly, using an orthotopic animal model, we found
reduction in tumor size (P < 0.001) when DIM was given in
combination with oxaliplatin compared with monotherapy.
This was accompanied by loss of phospho-p65 and downregulation of NF-KB activity and its downstream genes (Bcl-xL,
survivin, and XIAP), which correlated with reduced cell
proliferation (as assessed by Ki-67 immunostaining of tumor
specimens) and evidence of apoptosis [as assessed by
poly(ADP-ribose) polymease cleavage and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining]. These results provide strong in vivo evidence in support
of our hypothesis that DIM could abrogate chemotherapeutic
drug (cisplatin, gemcitabine, and/or oxaliplatin)–induced
activation of NF-KB, resulting in the chemosensitization of
pancreatic tumors to conventional therapeutics. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Despite advances in multimodality treatment including targeted
therapies, pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause of
cancer death in the United States (1), accounting for 37,680
estimated new cases diagnosed in the year 2008 with 34,290 deaths.
These grim statistics are in part due to the indolent nature of this

disease and lack of specific biomarkers for early detection. Clinical
management of pancreatic cancer becomes further complicated
due to both de novo chemoresistance and acquisition of chemoresistance during therapy by conventional cytotoxic agents (2–5).
Moreover, primary treatment by surgery is most often palliative;
thus, postoperative therapy including chemotherapy with and
without chemoradiation therapy is necessary for the management
of pancreatic cancer, although the therapeutic outcome of current
strategies is dismal without any survival benefit. Similarly targeted
therapies have been proven to be ineffective in this disease. For
example, inactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling
pathway by the epidermal growth factor receptor-related tyrosine
kinase inhibitor erlotinib have been tried in pancreatic cancer,
showing only modest survival benefit in large phase III clinical trial
when combined with gemcitabine (6), suggesting that novel
approaches must be devised for improving the survival outcome
for this deadly disease. Here, we report the results of one such novel
strategy using ‘‘natural agents’’ that could be useful for the
treatment of pancreatic cancer.
It is now well accepted that "natural agents" from vegetables
of the family Cruciferae yield a bioactive phytochemical known
as indole-3-carbinol (I3C; refs. 7, 8), which is chemically unstable
in aqueous and gastric acidic environment; thus, it is rapidly
converted to numerous condensation products, among which 3,3¶diindolylmethane (DIM) showed biological activities (9). In a study
reported by Reed and colleagues, I3C was not detectable in the
plasma of women ingesting I3C but DIM was the only I3C-derived
compound detected in the plasma (10), suggesting that DIM is the
predominant bioactive compound. Emerging preclinical evidence
also suggest that I3C and its dimeric product DIM possess
anticarcinogenic effects in experimental animals and also inhibits
the growth and induce apoptosis in prostate, breast, colon, cervix,
and pancreas cancer cells (11–20), which is mediated by alterations
in multiple signaling pathways (9, 14, 18, 21, 22). Recently, a study
reported from our laboratory concluded that inhibition of cell
proliferation by DIM (a formulated DIM with enhanced pharmacokinetics) is mediated through the regulation of Akt/FOXO3a/
GSK-3h/h-catenin signaling and induction of Par-4 (20, 22).
Additional clinically relevant study reported by our laboratory
and others confirmed that DIM inhibits human primary endothelial cell migration in culture and decreased blood vessel formation
in xenograft tumors of human breast and prostate (21, 23).
Furthermore, we and others have shown that DIM and I3C reduce
the activity of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) in prostate, breast, and
other cancer cells (15, 24). Collectively, these scientific findings
led to a significant interest in the past few years to explore the
potential chemopreventive and therapeutic activity of DIM against
multiple cancers. It is, however, important to note that DIM but not
I3C is safer in humans and that administration of DIM to human
volunteers results in adequate serum levels that could be
biologically important (10, 25, 26).

3,3-Diindolylmethane as Anticancer Agent

Previously, we have conceptualized that natural dietary substances (natural agents such as DIM) may have therapeutic benefit
in addition to their role as chemopreventive agent by virtue of their
pleiotropic activity on cancer cells including inactivation of
survival signaling pathways (epidermal growth factor receptor/
Akt/NF-nB) and simultaneous activation of multiple death pathways (27). Moreover, we have shown that the apoptosis-inducing
effect of erlotinib could be potentiated by DIM in pancreatic cancer
cells in vitro (11); however, such studies have not been reported
using conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine
or oxaliplatin especially because platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin and oxaliplatin are used as an
alternate treatment option for pancreatic cancer (28–31). Because
chemoresistant phenotype is a major impediment in delivering
effective cytotoxic therapy to cancer cells using conventional
therapeutics, here, we report for the first time the effect of DIM in
sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and pancreatic cancer
tumors in vivo to lower concentrations of the conventional
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines PANC-1 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human pancreatic
ductal epithelial cells Colo-357 and Panc-28 were obtained from University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The cell lines were maintained in
continuous exponential growth by twice a week passaging in DMEM or
keratinocyte serum-free medium for human pancreatic ductal epithelial
cells (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 10 mg/mL streptomycin.
Antibodies were obtained from the following commercial sources:
caspase-3, caspase-9, phospho-Akt, cytochrome c, and cytochrome c
oxidase (Cell Signaling); anti-mouse Bcl-xL, Bax, Mcl-1, and anti-retinoblastoma antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-poly(ADP-ribose)
polymease (PARP) antibody (Biomol Research). Anti-XIAP, cIAP (pan), and
survivin were from R&D Systems. Anti-h-actin antibody was from Sigma.
DIM (LKT Laboratories) was dissolved in DMSO to make 20 mmol/L stock
solution. Cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and gemcitabine was obtained from the
Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute pharmacy.
Cell viability inhibition by MTT assay. Cells were seeded at a density of
2  103 to 3  103 per well in 96-well microtiter culture plates. After
overnight incubation, fresh medium containing different concentrations of
DIM (0-60 Amol/L; 0.1% final concentration of DMSO; similar approach was
used for BITC and the final concentration of 10 Amol/L BITC was used) was
added to each well and incubated for 72 h and then subjected to MTT assay
as described earlier (32) with or without cytotoxic agents.
Cell viability inhibition by cytotoxic agents. PANC-1, Panc-28, and
Colo-357 cells were plated as described above and allowed to attach
overnight. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing
30 Amol/L DIM for 24 h and then exposed to cytotoxic agents for an
additional 72 h. Thus, for single agent, cells were exposed to DIM for
96 h and to cisplatin, gemcitabine, or oxaliplatin for 72 h. The effect of
pretreatment on cell viability was examined by MTT assay as described
earlier (32) and synergism was calculated using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).
Quantification of apoptosis. The Cell Apoptosis ELISA Detection Kit
(Roche) was used to detect apoptosis as described earlier (33).
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis. The pancreatic cancer
cells PANC-1 were plated and allowed to attach for 36 h. DIM was directly
added to cell cultures at the indicated concentrations and incubated for
72 h. Cell lysates were prepared by suspending the cells in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer and subjected to routine Western
blot analysis as described earlier (33).
Cytochrome c release assay. Cells were plated at a density of 5  106 in
100 mm dish and allowed to attach overnight. DIM was added to freshly
replaced medium at indicated concentrations (0-45 Amol/L). Following

termination of incubation period, cells were collected, washed with ice-cold
PBS, lysed and processed to obtain cytosolic and mitochondria fraction for
cytochrome c immunoblotting as described earlier (33).
Caspase-3 activity assay. Caspase-3 activity were measured in wholecell lysates using commercially available assay kit (R&D Systems) according
to the manufacturer’s instruction.
DNA cell cycle analysis. PANC-1 cells were seeded and treated with DIM
(0-45 Amol/L) for 72 h. After treatments, the cells were collected by
trypsinization, washed with cold PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol, and stained
with propidium iodide for 30 min. Flow cytometric analysis was carried out
using FACScan.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared
from treated samples and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was done by
incubating 10 Ag nuclear extract with IRDye-700-labeled NF-nB oligonucleotide as described earlier (32). The DNA-protein complex formed was
visualized by Odyssey Infrared Imaging System using Odyssey Software
Release 1.1.
Experimental animals. Female ICR-SCID mice were purchased from
Taconic Farms. The mice were housed and maintained under sterile
conditions and used in accordance with Animal Care and Use Guidelines of
Wayne State University. Mice received Lab Diet 5021 (Purina Mills).
Orthotopic implantation of tumor cells. PANC-1 cells were harvested
from subconfluent cultures washed once in serum-free medium and
resuspended in PBS. Cells (1  106) in 15 AL PBS were injected into the
parenchyma of pancreas with a 27-gauge hypodermic needle as described
earlier (33).
Experimental protocol. Mice were randomized into the following
treatment groups (n = 7): (a) untreated control; (b) BR-DIM 5.0 mg/mice
daily orally by gavage for 25 days; (c) oxaliplatin 15 mg/kg body weight
intravenously given once as a bolus; and (d) BR-DIM and oxaliplatin
following the schedule as for individual treatments. All mice were killed on
day 25 since the initiation of BR-DIM treatment. Body weight of mice from
all the groups was recorded every fifth day after cell implantation. For
imaging, 2 to 3 mice per group were injected with EGF-IRDye-800CW
(epidermal growth factor receptor antibody) via tail vein (1 nmol/L per
mice) 72 h before euthanizing the animals. Imaging of live animals was done
using Odyssey Infrared Imaging system under anesthesia. Upon autopsy, the
pancreas was excised neatly, weighed, and subsequently processed for H&E,
immunohistochemical staining, and preparation of nuclear protein extracts
for electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western immunoblotting.
Histologic sections and immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed tissue
sections were evaluated for tumor cell cytology, mitotic rate, growth
pattern, necrosis, cystic change, and associated inflammatory cellular
response. Immunohistochemical studies were done after staining with
specific primary antibodies against phospho-p65 and Ki-67 followed by 3,3¶diaminobenzidine staining. Apoptotic cells were identified by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling using
Chemicon Apotag In situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Chemicon) and
visualized under an Olympus microscope (Olympus).
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as mean F SD for the absolute
values or percent of controls as indicated in the vertical axis legend of
Figs. 1 to 5. The statistical significance of differential findings between
experimental groups and control was determined by Student’s t test.
P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Effect of DIM on cell viability and apoptosis induction and
cell cycle arrest. As shown in Fig. 1A, in almost all pancreatic
cancer cell lines, DIM suppressed viability in a dose-dependent
manner and had minimal effect on human pancreatic ductal
epithelial cells, suggesting the relatively nontoxic nature of this
compound on normal cells. These results were also consistent with
induction of apoptosis induced by DIM treatment (Fig. 1B and C).
Moreover, the sub-G1 DNA content analysis showed increased
accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase in a dose-dependent

manner (data not shown). Further analysis showed that DIM
treatment resulted in a significant increase of cell population in the
G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle (49% versus 71% cells at 0 and
45 Amol/L concentrations of DIM, respectively; Fig. 1D). The increase
in cell population in the G0-G1 phase was found to be associated
with a concomitant decrease in cell population in the S phase,
whereas the population of cells in G2-M phase did not change
significantly compared with the corresponding controls (Fig. 1D).
Overall, these results support the notion that the observed decline
in cell viability by DIM was in part due to cell cycle arrest and
induction of apoptosis. We then investigated the status of cell
survival and apoptosis-related molecules in DIM-treated cells using
PANC-1 as representative cell type, because this cell line is
moderately resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs and have molecular signature similar to human pancreatic tumors harboring K-ras
and p53 mutations.
DIM inhibits apoptotic molecules in PANC-1 cells. As shown
in Fig. 1C, Bcl-xL protein level was inhibited, whereas proapoptotic
Bax protein level was markedly induced in response to DIM

treatment, indicating that the apoptotic effects of DIM are partly
due to increased Bax/Bcl-xL protein ratio. Relative to control,
Mcl-1, survivin, XIAP, cIAP (pan), and phospho-Akt expression was
down-regulated in cells exposed to DIM for 72 h. These results
provide convincing mechanistic evidence in support of DIMinduced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, which is consistent
with increase levels of active caspase-3, caspase-9, and 85 kDa
cleaved intermediate of PARP in PANC-1 cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting
that DIM-induced apoptosis is mediated, at least in part, by the
mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, to confirm the involvement of
mitochondrial pathway and the release of cytochrome c, we
separated cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from PANC-1 cells
and showed that DIM was able to induce the release of cytochrome
c from mitochondria into cytosol in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1C). We next assessed the effects of conventional therapeutics
alone and in combination with DIM.
DIM sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to multiple cytotoxic
agents by reducing cell viability and promoting apoptosis. We
assessed the effect of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin alone

on the viability of different pancreatic cancer cells by MTT assay
and found a concentration-dependent inhibition of pancreatic
cancer cell viability (data not shown). We noted differential
sensitivity of cells toward gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, with Colo357 being highly sensitive to low concentrations of gemcitabine as
well as oxaliplatin compared with other pancreatic cancer cells
(data not shown). In our subsequent studies, we found that
treatment of cells with DIM or cisplatin, gemcitabine, or oxaliplatin
alone ( for 72 h) caused >25% to 50% (P < 0.01) loss of pancreatic
cancer cell viability (Fig. 2A); however, pretreatment of cells with
DIM for 24 h followed by treatment with the cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin)
for 72 h resulted in a significant loss of cell viability (<65-80%;
P < 0.001) in all the cell lines tested. Morphologic feature
characteristics of apoptosis were observed as depicted by the

microphotographs (Fig. 2B). In control culture, the cells were seen
attached and reaching near confluent, whereas cells tend to show
slightly less proficiency in growth and viability following singleregimen treatments. However, the changes tend to become more
pronounced and prominent in the combination group, wherein the
cells appears to round off, detach, and were seen floating, all of
which are typical characteristics of apoptotic cell death. The
attached cells appeared pleiomorphic and elongated.
Next, we determined the combination index values for all three
combination treatment groups, where combination index < 1
indicates synergism, combination index > 1 indicates antagonism,
and combination index = 1 indicates additive effect. Our results
(Fig. 2C) clearly showed that PANC-1 cells pretreated with DIM
showed synergistic loss of the cell viability when combined with
cisplatin, gemcitabine, and/or oxaliplatin (combination indices =

0.74, 0.66, and 0.96, respectively).These results are of paramount
interest clinically in minimizing toxic side effects of chemotherapeutic agents on normal cells. These results were also seen
consistent with synergistic induction of apoptosis (f50% more;
P < 0.01; Fig. 3A). It is important to note that we did not find
synergistic effects using BITC (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting
that DIM is superior to BITC in our experimental system. Further
molecular mechanistic investigations by Western immunoblotting
revealed in PANC-1 cells pretreatment with DIM augmented PARP
cleavage and the appearance of active cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3B),
which was consistent with spectrophotometric assay results
showing significant increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3C). In
agreement with our results with PARP and caspase-3 activity, we
found significant up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of
Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, survivin, cIAP, and XIAP proteins in the combination
treatment group (Fig. 3B), indicating that DIM indeed sensitizes
pancreatic cancer cells to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin,
gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin. Because many of the antiapoptotic
proteins are regulated by NF-nB, we assessed the role of NF-nB in
our experimental system.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

DIM inhibits activation of NF-KB and down-regulates NF-KB
activation stimulated by oxaliplatin and gemcitabine. As
shown in Fig. 4A, DIM resulted in a concentration-dependent
decrease in the DNA-binding activity of NF-nB in PANC-1 and
Panc-28 pancreatic cancer cells, which is consistent with the downregulation of the transcriptional target genes of NF-nB such as
Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP. To further
assess the role of NF-nB, experiments were done to determine
optimal treatment schedule and dose of individual chemotherapeutic agents in stimulating basal level of NF-nB in PANC-1 cells.
For this study, we exposed PANC-1 cells to 30 Amol/L DIM for
48 h followed by 3 h of either gemcitabine (100 nmol/L), cisplatin
(500 nmol/L), or oxaliplatin (63 Amol/L), prepared nuclear extracts,
and subjected to NF-nB DNA-binding assay by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay. Consistent with previously published data
from our laboratory (32), we found that gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin treatment alone for 3 h induced NF-nB DNA-binding
activity (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, we also found that pretreatment of
cells with 30 Amol/L DIM significantly reduced chemotherapeutic
agents-induced activation of NF-nB DNA-binding activity (Fig. 4B).

These results show that DIM not only down-regulates the
preexisting basal levels of NF-nB DNA-binding activity in
unstimulated pancreatic cancer cells but could also inhibit
gemcitabine, cisplatin, and/or oxaliplatin-induced NF-nB activation, which is consistent with our hypothesis.
Moreover, using pancreatic cancer cell line expressing phosphorylation-defective InBa (S32 and 36A) cells (generous gift from
Dr, Paul Chiao, University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center),
we confirmed the absence of NF-nB and its target genes in these
cells (Fig. 4C). We treated these cells with DIM and oxaliplatin
using our protocol employing pretreatment with DIM followed by
oxaliplatin treatment. As anticipated, inhibition of NF-nB signaling
in these cells leads not only to a significant decrease in the
expression of several of the NF-nB downstream targets (Fig. 4C) but
also exhibited loss of cell viability (>50% loss) compared with Panc28 (containing constitutively active NF-nB) cells in the combination
treatment group (Fig. 4D). These in vitro studies prompted us to
conduct in vivo testing of our hypothesis, and the results are
presented below.
DIM enhances in vivo therapeutic effect of oxaliplatin on
primary tumor. To be consistent with clinical relevance of our
results, we used an absorption-enhanced formulation of DIM,
henceforth called BR-DIM (obtained from Bio-Response) for our
in vivo studies. Under our experimental conditions (as depicted in
Fig. 5A), administration of BR-DIM by gavage caused only a
minimal (20% reduction) effect on tumor weight. Additionally,
relative to control group, oxaliplatin treatment alone caused 50%
reduction in tumor weight (Fig. 5B). However, under identical
experimental conditions, the combination of BR-DIM and oxaliplatin showed significant decrease (P < 0.001) in tumor weight
relative to untreated control group. These results were consistent
with imaging results (Fig. 5C). Of interest, on autopsy, 86% of mice

from the control group showed evidence of nodal metastasis. In
contrast, a progressive decline in the percentage of mice harboring
nodal metastasis, as well as metastatic tumor size, was prominently
evident in the BR-DIM and oxaliplatin combination groups as
represented in Fig. 5D. Moreover, no evidence of any toxicity as
inferred from body weight loss criteria or signs of aversion to food
intake or diarrhea were evident within therapeutic window.
NF-KB DNA-binding activity and PARP cleavage in vivo.
Similar to our in vitro findings, NF-nB in the nuclear extracts of
tumor samples was moderately down-regulated by BR-DIM alone,
but, unlike in vitro situation, oxaliplatin did not reveal any overtly
induced NF-nB DNA-binding activity relative to control specimens.
Interestingly, constitutively expressed NF-nB was seen abrogated in
tumor samples obtained from mice treated with BR-DIM and
oxaliplatin (Fig. 6A). Whole-tissue lysates from harvested tumors
revealed down-regulation of a few important NF-nB regulated
antiapoptotic molecules such as Bcl-xL, survivin, and XIAP proteins
in vivo, which is consistent with our in vitro results.
Tumor histology and immunohistochemistry. H&E evaluation of the tumors from all four groups showed high-grade
carcinoma associated with tumor apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 6C).
In the control group, the tumor was largely viable and consisted
entirely of neoplastic cells with minimal intratumoral stroma. In
contrast, in the group receiving combined treatment, there was
severe tumor destruction throughout the entire tumor and it was
associated with increased stromal fibrosis. Similar but only milder
changes were also seen in the tumors of the group treated with
BR-DIM or oxaliplatin alone. The expression of phospho-p65 was
significantly decreased in the combination group compared with
the control (Fig. 6C) and milder effects were seen BR-DIM or
oxaliplatin alone group, which is consistent with our results on the
DNA-binding activity of NF-nB. Likewise, significant apoptosis was

reduced staining for Ki-67 (Fig. 6C). Together, these results provide
convincing evidence in support of the superior antitumor activity
of the combination of BR-DIM with oxaliplatin, and these in vivo
results are consistent with our in vitro findings.

Discussion
Here, we report for the first time that DIM could be
therapeutically exploited for the treatment of pancreatic cancer
in combination with conventional therapeutics. We found that
DIM was effective as a general inducer of apoptosis in pancreatic
cancer cells by down-regulating several antiapoptotic proteins but
had no effect on normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells.
Moreover, DIM was effective in down-regulating Bcl-2 family
proteins as well as IAPs and survivin in pancreatic cancer cells,
abrogating treatment resistance via inhibition of caspase cascade
(34, 35). Evidence from our laboratory and others have shown
that the transcription factor, NF-nB, is constitutively active in
human pancreatic tumor specimens as well as in pancreatic
cancer cell lines and that NF-nB is intimately involved with
de novo and acquired chemoresistant phenotype of pancreatic
cancer cells (5, 36–38). Moreover, during chemotherapy, NF-nB is

transiently activated leading to chemoresistance phenotype and
the inactivation of NF-nB before treatment with conventional
therapeutics leads to sensitization (better cell killing) of cancer
cells to conventional therapeutics as shown by our laboratory and
others (5, 27, 32, 33, 39). Zhang and colleagues recently reported
that IKK inhibitor could confer sensitivity to pancreatic cancer
cells and xenograft tumors by blocking activation of IKK/NF-nB
pathway and downstream genes, which leads to enhanced effect
of tumor necrosis factor-a on the growth of tumor cells through
activation of apoptosis (40). We hypothesized that DIM at the
molecular level can function as a "double-edged sword" by
abrogating the constitutively active DNA-binding activity of
NF-nB and also by attenuating the chemotherapeutic drugsinduced activation of NF-nB. Our findings using isogenic Panc-28
and Panc-28 InBaM PaCa cell line [with mutation in the two
serine residues 32 and 36 of inhibitory InBa, which blocks
phosphorylation and degradation of InBa protein and results in
superrepressor form of InBa, preventing nuclear translocation of
NF-nB and its binding to regulatory sequences ref. 41]
convincingly showed that NF-nB activation plays a critical role
in protecting the cells against apoptosis induced by cytotoxic
agents, which provide direct evidence in support of our
hypothesis and other published data (42).
It is known that Bcl-xL, XIAP, cIAP, and survivin (members of
IAP proteins) are regulated by NF-nB at the transcriptional level

3,3-Diindolylmethane as Anticancer Agent

and also contributes to pancreatic cancer chemoresistance, which
can be suppressed by NF-nB inhibition (34, 35, 43–45). Thus, by
suppressing NF-nB, DIM induces cell growth inhibition and
apoptosis, which is in part due to inactivation of NF-nB and its
downstream genes contributing to the reversal of chemoresistance. This phenomenon could be universal among various tumors
because high expression of these proteins has also been shown to
be associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor
prognosis in carcinomas of the lung, breast, ovary, and esophagus
(46, 47). Survivin has been validated as a therapeutic target
because of its dual function in inhibiting apoptosis and regulation
of mitosis in concert with different cell cycle regulators (48).
Recently, small interfering RNA directed against survivin and
NF-nB p65/relA leading to enhanced chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine has been reported (38, 49) and
these results are consistent with our current findings.
Interestingly, our in vitro results were recapitulated in vivo using
oxaliplatin as a test agent and we believe that similar phenomenon
may exist with many other conventional therapeutics. Our data
clearly show that the down-regulation of NF-nB and its downstream targets such as Bcl-xL, survivin, and XIAP is responsible for
the enhanced antitumor activity of the combination treatment in
our orthotopic pancreatic tumor model, which support our in vivo
imaging results and complement pancreatic tumor weight at
autopsy. Immunohistochemistry of tumor samples showed significantly reduced phospho-p65 immunostaining in the combination
group and increased apoptosis as documented by increased
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end
labeling staining and less immunoreactivity toward Ki-67, indica-

tive of reduced proliferation of cells in tumors treated with BR-DIM
and oxaliplatin. These in vivo results were also consistent with our
molecular studies in vitro, which clearly provide strong support in
favor of our hypothesis that NF-nB is an important target in
overcoming de novo and acquired chemoresistance in pancreatic
cancer, which could be easily achieved by our nontoxic strategy by
using BR-DIM.
In conclusion, we have presented evidence showing that
pancreatic cancer cells with de novo and acquired resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, and
oxaliplatin could be reversed by DIM pretreatment and that this
beneficial effect is in part due to inactivation of NF-nB and its
downstream genes. Our in vitro findings together with our
in vivo results provide confidence in support of further
development of DIM (a nontoxic natural agent) as an adjunct
to conventional therapeutics in future clinical trial for improving
the treatment outcome of patients diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer.
