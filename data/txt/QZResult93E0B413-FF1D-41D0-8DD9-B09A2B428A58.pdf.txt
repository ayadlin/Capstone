BACKGROUND. Although it is known that small intestinal carcinoids are derived
from enterochromaffin (EC) cells, these cells remain poorly characterized and
little is known of the growth regulatory mechanisms of these neuroendocrine
cells. Down-regulation or loss of the transforming growth factor-b1 (TGFb1) cytostatic program and activation of TGFb-mediated transcriptional networks is associated with uncontrolled growth and metastasis in other neural tumors,
glioblastomas. Whether this phenomenon is common to small intestinal carcinoid tumors was investigated.

METHODS. The effects of TGFb1 on cultured normal EC cells (isolated by FACS

time-dependent response of SMAD4, SMAD7, c-Myc, and P21WAF1/CIP1 protein
expression and c-Myc and p21WAF1/CIP1 transcript was measured in response to
TGFb1 and the transcript expression of candidate downstream targets, MTA1 and

RESULTS. TGFb1 inhibited normal EC cell proliferation (IC50 ¼ 17 pM) but stimulated neoplastic EC cell proliferation (EC50 ¼ 22 pM). In tumor cells, significantly
decreased transcript (P < .01) of TGFbRII was identified, but no receptor mutations were identified and protein expression was evident. TGFb1 (1 ng/mL)
resulted in SMAD2 phosphorylation and <7% nuclear expression compared with
93% in normal EC cells. In neoplastic cells, TGFb1 (1 ng/mL) caused a decrease
in SMAD4 (>16%, P < .05), whereas SMAD7 and c-Myc transcript and protein
were respectively increased >21% (P < .05) and 40% (P < .002). TGFb1 (1 ng/
mL) also decreased p21WAF1/CIP1 transcript by 60% (P < .001) and protein that was
undetectable at 24 hours. Expression of the downstream targets of the c-Myc
pathway, MTA1, was increased (20%) and E-cadherin decreased (30%).

CONCLUSIONS. The neoplastic EC cell is characterized by loss of TGFb-1mediated growth inhibition and, similar to glioblastomas, utilizes the TGFb sysSupported in part by Grants R01-CA-097050 and

increasing (700% in the last 3 decades1), and outcome data demonstrate no alteration in survival in
this time period.1,2 Despite these dramatic clinical
observations, to our knowledge there has been little
investigation of this class of neoplasia. As a consequence, biochemical markers of early disease have
not been identified, the mechanisms responsible for
the growth or metastasis of these tumors are for the
most part unknown, and no molecular tools exist to
predict malignant progression.3 In contrast to the
small intestinal carcinoids (EC cell-derived), gastric
carcinoids (EC-like cell-derived) have been well characterized and, therefore, early diagnosis is possible,
the mechanistic basis of disease is established, and a
rational therapeutic strategy thus exists with excellent outcome.3 Gastric carcinoids are derived from
the ECL cells that proliferate in response to elevated
levels of gastrin caused by decreased acid secretion.4,5 In contrast, the mechanisms of neoplastic
transformation of the small intestinal EC cell are
unknown and uncharacterized.3
Examining the molecular alterations that characterize malignancy and metastases have identified
that EC cell carcinoids exhibit a microsatellite stable
phenotype with retention of mismatch repair function,6,7 but often display chromosomal alterations,
particularly loss of chromosome 18, which occurs in
50% to 67% of cases.8 This arises early in small intestinal carcinoid development and is present in both
primary tumors and metastases.9 Chromosome 18
encodes SMAD4 (18q21),10 which regulates TGFb signaling,11 a growth inhibitory factor expressed in most
small intestinal carcinoids.12 Because this chromosome is often lost in small intestinal carcinoids, aberrations in the TGFb-mediated inhibitory pathway
constitute a plausible mechanism for neoplastic
transformation in these lesions.
The TGFb-mediated cytostatic pathway is considered a barrier to tumor emergence and progression and loss of this program is considered a
hallmark of cancer.11,13 Evasion of cytostasis is a
strong selective advantage and tumor cells can
achieve this through a number of mechanisms,
including coding sequence mutations in the TGFbRII
(in gliomas, gastric, and colorectal cancers14,15),
mutations in SMAD2 (in colorectal and lung cancers14), and SMAD4 (in approximately 10% of all colon cancers and in 25% to 90% of all pancreatic
tumors14) or via inactivation of ELF signaling.16 In
other types of cancers, TGFb appears to play a more
complex, dual role. At early stages, the TGFb pathway functions as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting primary tumor growth, but at later stages tumor cells
develop the ability to bypass these tumor suppressor

2421

functions and TGFb appears to promote tumor progression.13 A loss of the cytostatic program, despite
retention of functional TGFb receptors and SMAD
activity, has been reported in neural cell-derived
tumors such as glioblastomas.17,18 In this system the
TGFb system induces gene responses associated with
growth promotion (eg, production of autocrine mitogens18), and invasion and evasion of immune surveillance and metastasis.13 The question remains
whether similar mechanisms exist in cells that are
classified as neuron-endocrine.
Despite alterations in chromosome 18, to our
knowledge no SMAD4 mutations have been identified in small intestinal carcinoids,19 although they
exhibit variable expression of TGFbRII (upstream of
SMAD4),6 and variable expression of the TGFb1 cytostatic program targets protein P21WAF1/CIP1.20,21 In
addition, they frequently express c-Myc,22 a TGFb1
pathway antagonist. This information as well as data
that TGFb1 suppresses neuroendocrine cell proliferation23 has led us to hypothesize that neoplastic EC
cells are characterized by down-regulation or loss of
the TGFb1-mediated cytostatic program. We propose
that in EC tumor cells (the cell type of small intestinal carcinoids) the TGFb pathway activates signal
transduction and transcriptional programs that result
in uncontrolled growth, metastasis, and expansion as
noted in neural cell-derived tumors like glioblastomas.17,18
Because mutations are present in only a small
percentage of tumors refractory to TGFb1 growth inhibition,24–26 we have focused on perturbations in
downstream targets of the TGFb pathway.11,14 We
therefore examined P21,WAF1/CIP1 c-Myc, MTA1
(ac-Myc transcriptional target), E-cadherin, and the
ERK pathway. MTA1 was examined because it is a
metastasis factor overexpressed in malignant primary
GI carcinoids and their metastases27 and has been
linked to a worse prognosis in patients with EC cellderived appendiceal carcinoids.28 E-cadherin is of interest because reduced expression correlates with
malignant carcinoid behavior,21 whereas the ERK
pathway is relevant because it is active in the majority of GI carcinoids,29 and may be cross-activated
either by TGFb130 or by growth factors directly
released by TGFb1.11
It has not been possible to address these
mechanistic questions previously because to our
knowledge no homogenous human EC cell preparations or cell lines existed until we developed the
methodology to isolate and culture normal human
small intestinal EC cells.31 In addition, we have
developed and characterized a rapidly growing, longterm, primary tumor-derived, human carcinoid cell

line, KRJ-I.31,32 This small intestinal EC cell-derived
in vitro model is ideal to examine the TGFb1 pathway because the alternatives such as the BON pancreatic tumor cell line,33 the COLO320DM colonic
cell line,34 or the GOT1 liver metastases-derived cell
line35 are either of a mixed cell origin or are derived
from metastases. In this study, using preparations of
homogenous human EC cells and the KRJ-I cell line,
we examined the proliferative effects of TGFb1 and
then delineated aspects of the TGFb1 signaling pathway alterations that characterize the EC cell neoplastic phenotype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Normal EC Cells
EC cells from the terminal ileum (from right hemicolectomy resections: n ¼ 5) were isolated using pronase digestion, Nycodenz gradient centrifugation,
and FACS sorting of acridine orange-labeled cells as
described.31 FACS sorted cells (2 3 104 cells/100 lL)
were cultured in Ham F12 medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, Md) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
and antibiotics (100 U penicillin/mL 1 100 lg streptomycin/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo) (2 3 104
cells/well 96-well collagen I-coated plates; Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, Calif) in a humidified atmosphere at 378C in 5% carbon dioxide for 72 hours.

Neoplastic EC Cells (KRJ-I Cell Line)
KRJ-I cells grow as a suspension culture and were
cultured similar to normal EC cells in Ham F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and
antibiotics.31,36 Cells were incubated at 378C with 5%
carbon dioxide. Population doubling level (PDL)37 25
to 30 was used for all experiments.

Proliferation Studies
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 3 104 cells/
well in Ham F12 (100 U penicillin/mL 1 100 lg
streptomycin/mL).31,36 TGFb1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif [hBA-112, sc-4561]) was
added at concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 100
pM (n ¼ 8 wells for each concentration)38 and cells
were incubated for 72 hours. MTT was added (final
concentration 0.5 mg/mL per well) and incubated for
3 hours (378C at 5% carbon dioxide), and the reaction stopped by adding acid-isopropanol, and the
formazan dye solubilized. Optical density was read at
595 nanometers (nm) using a microplate reader (BioRad, Hercules, Calif; 3500).36

Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
RNA was extracted from 1 3 106 acutely isolated normal EC cells (n ¼ 3) or 5 3 106 KRJ-I cells in log
phase growth (n ¼ 3) (TRIZOL, Invitrogen, La Jolla,
Calif) and cleaned (Qiagen RNeasy kit and DNeasy
Tissue kit, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif ) to minimize contaminating genomic DNA. RNA (2 lg) was converted
to cDNA (High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit; Applied
Biosystems [ABI], Foster City, Calif).6,39 Real-time
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analysis was performed using Assays-onDemand products and the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System according to the manufacturer’s suggestions.6 Cycling was performed under standard
conditions (TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix Protocol) and the Standard Curve Method (ABI User Bulletin #2) used to determine relative transcript levels.
Products included TGFb1 (Hs00171257_m1), TGFbRI
(Hs00610319_m1), TGFbRII (Hs00559661_m1), SMAD4
(Hs00232068_m1), SMAD7 (Hs00178696_m1), ELF
(Hs00162271_m1), p15INK4b (Hs00365249_m1), p21WAF1/
CIP1
(Hs00355782_m1), and c-myc (Hs00153408_m1).
Data was normalized using geNorm40 and expression of
the novel house-keeping genes ALG9, TFCP2, and
ZNF410.41
MTA1 and E-Cadherin Transcript Analysis
The effect of TGFb1 on MTA1 and E-cadherin transcript was measured in short-term cultured normal
and neoplastic cells. Cells were stimulated with
TGFb1 (1 ng/mL) for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes
and RNA isolated as described above. Real-time
RT-PCR analysis was performed as described above
for MTA1 (Hs00183042_m1) and E-cadherin
(Hs00170423_m1) and data were normalized using
geNorm and expression of ALG9, TFCP2, and
ZNF410.41
Sequence Analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from KRJ-I cells (2 3
106 KRJ-I cells in log phase growth: n ¼ 3) using a
Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit.6 The BAT-RII repeat
sequence and (GT)3 microsatellite region of TGFbRII
were analyzed as previously described.6 For SMAD
mutations, SMAD2 (exons 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11) and
SMAD4 (exons 4, 10, 11, 12, and 13) were examined
as described.42 Purified PCR products were sequenced and analyzed by the W.M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University using an
automated Applied Biosystems 373A Stretch DNA
sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). PCR products were initially sequenced using the forward
primer. If ambiguous peaks were present, the
sequence was confirmed with the reverse primer.6

Western Blot Analysis
KRJ-I cells (2 3 106 KRJ-I cells in log phase growth:
n ¼ 3) were prepared as previously described.43 Cells
were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized using a mortar and pestle before the addition
of RIPA buffer. Protein concentration was assayed
using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Samples
were boiled in Laemmli reducing buffer and equal
protein resolved on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels.
Protein was immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes by electrotransfer. After blocking (5% nonfat
milk for 60 minutes at room temperature [RT]), gels
were immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies TGFbRII (#sc-220, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), pSMAD2 (#3101, 1:1000; Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, Mass), SMAD4 (IMG-565, 1:500;
IMGENEX, San Diego, Calif), SMAD7 (IMG-531,
1:1500; IMGENEX), and b-actin (sc-1616R. 1:4000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse anti-P21WAF1/CIP1
(0.5 mg/mL; Becton Dickinson) overnight at 48C and
then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn;
1:4000 for 30 minutes at RT). Membrane-bound antibodies were detected using a luminol-based chemiluminescence system (Roche, Nutley, NJ). Blots were
exposed on X-OMAT-AR film. Gels were stripped and
reprobed with anti-b-actin to confirm equivalent
protein loading. Densitometry analysis of bands was
performed by Scion Image (Scion, Frederick, Md).

Immunostaining
Normal EC cells or KRJ-I cells (5 3 104 cells) were
fixed in methanol and pipetted onto frosted microscope slides stained with a series of antibodies
including anti-TGFbRII (1:1000, sc-220), neuroendocrine-specific antibodies (mouse chromogranin A
[1:1000, DakoCytomation, Dako, Carpinteria, Calif] or
mouse VMAT1 [1:100; Chemicon, Temecula, Calif]),
EC cell-specific antibodies (mouse TPH [1 lg/mL,
Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif], mouse serotonin [Dako,
1:20], or rabbit substance P [1:200, GeneTex, San
Antonio, Tex], and DAPI (40 ,60 diamidino-2-phenylindole) (20 mg/mL) overnight at 48C.31,36 After washing
(0.1% Tween/PBS), cells were stained with secondary
antibody (FITC-antimouse/rabbit, 1:100; Promega,
Madison, Wis) (1 hour at RT). Fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize and count the number of
positive cells, with 1 3 103 cells counted for each
antibody. As a control for nonspecific staining, primary antibodies were excluded in matched groups.

of ERK pathway activation, cells were also preincubated with PD98059 (30 lM) (an inhibitor of ERK1/2
phosphorylation) for 30 minutes before the addition
of TGFb1. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was measured
using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay
(ELISA) approach (SuperArray CASE, Frederick, Md)
as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, stimulated cells were fixed (4% formaldehyde), and stained
with either primary antibodies against the nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated forms of each protein
(60 minutes at RT). After washing and secondary
antibody application (60 minutes at RT), cells were
incubated with color developer (10 minutes at RT)
and plates read at 450 nm. Thereafter, protein was
assayed in each well (protein development: reading at
595 nm). The results were calculated as antibody (450
nm) per protein concentration (595 nm) and normalized to unstimulated cells. Phosphorylated signal was
compared with total nonphosphorylated signal.

RESULTS
Proliferation Studies: Effect of TGFb1 on Normal EC Cells
and Neoplastic (KRJ-I) Cells
In short-term cultured (72 hours) normal human EC
cells, TGFb1 significantly inhibited MTT uptake with
a maximal effect of 28  2.4% at 100 pM (Fig. 1A)
and an estimated IC50 ¼ 17.4 pM. In contrast, TGFb1
stimulated MTT uptake in the neoplastic EC cell line
over this time period (Fig. 1B). The maximal effect
was noted at 100 pM (31  3.7%); EC50 ¼ 20.18 pM.
This indicates that the TGFb1-mediated cytostatic
program is lost in neoplastic EC cells.

Transcript Levels of TGFb1 Signaling Components in
Normal and Neoplastic EC Cells
Using a real-time quantitative PCR approach and
normalization of expression levels using geNorm and
3 housekeeping genes (ALG9, TFCP2 and ZNF410),41
we evaluated the expression of genes involved in the
TGFb1 signaling network in normal (n ¼ 3) and neoplastic (n ¼ 3) EC cells. Significant differences were
apparent (Table 1). Normal EC cells expressed both
TGFbI and II receptors, ELF, p15INK4b, and p21WAF1/CIP1,

indicating that components of the TGFb1 signaling
network associated with the cytostatic response are
present. The tumor cell line, however, had significantly lower (2–100-fold) transcript levels of TGFbRI
and RII, ELF, and the cytostatic genes, p15INK4b and
p21WAF1/CIP1 (P < .01) and high expression (>1000fold) of SMAD4 and SMAD7 (P < .01). These data
indicate that a number of components of the TGFb1
signaling network are substantially altered in neoplastic EC cells.

Examination of TGFbRII Expression in KRJ-I Cells
TGFbRII protein was identified in KRJ-I cells by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A) and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis identified
the mature form of the protein (band of 87 kDa)
and the precursor (nonglycosylated) forms.45 Immunohistochemistry identified membrane staining for
TGFbRII and confirmed the transcript expression of
this receptor.
We examined 2 repeat regions in the TGFbRII
gene in genomic DNA from KRJ-I to assess whether
TGFbRII may encode activating mutations, as has
been demonstrated in loss of responsiveness to
TGFb in gliomas, gastric, and colorectal cancers.14,15
No frameshift mutations in the poly(A)10 (BAT-II
microsatellite region) or (GT)3 regions were detected.
Examination of TGFb-Mediated SMAD2 Phosphorylation
and Translocation
To examine whether the TGFb signaling pathway was
intact, we measured TGFb1-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation and relocation to the nucleus. Protein
levels of pSMAD2 were measured by Western blot
analysis in KRJ-I cells in response to TGFb1 (1 ng/
mL). PSMAD2 was detectable after 1-hour stimulation
(Fig. 3A). This suggests that TGFbRII in the neoplastic
cell was functional and that TGFb1 stimulated SMAD
phosphorylation. Immunohistochemical examination
of phosphorylated SMAD2, 1 hour after TGFb1 (1 ng/
mL), demonstrated that nuclear colocalization
occurred in only 6.3  0.7% of tumor cells, whereas
normal EC cells studied under the same experimental
conditions exhibited nuclear colocalization in
92.7  3.6% (P < .01) (Fig. 3B). In neoplastic EC cells,
pSMAD2 was almost exclusively sequestrated in the
cytoplasm.
These data indicate that TGFb1-mediated signal
transduction is blocked at the level of SMAD nuclear
translocation in neoplastic EC cells. This is consistent with the decreased transcript expression of ELF
and increased SMAD7 expression noted in KRJ-I cells
(Table 1) because ELF is critical for SMAD2 translocation,46 whereas SMAD7 is an antagonist of this
process.11
To assess whether pSMAD mutations resulted in
the inhibition of nuclear targeting of this transcription
factor, we examined mutational hotspots in SMAD2
(exons 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11)42 and SMAD4 (exons 4, 10,
11, 12, and 13),42 but no mutations in either of these
genes was identified in DNA from KRJ-I cells. We interpreted the absence of inactivating mutations in these
TGFb1 transcriptional activators as evidence that cytoplasmic SMAD2 sequestration was not due to a mutational event. Alternatively, low endogenous expression

of SMAD2 in KRJ-I cells could be a factor in the
decreased nuclear translocation, but this is unlikely as
staining levels were similar in normal and neoplastic
cells (Fig. 3B).

Examination of TGFb-Mediated SMAD4 and SMAD7
in KRJ-I
To examine the effect of TGFb1 on SMAD4 and
SMAD7 expression, we measured protein levels
(Western blot analysis) of SMAD4 and SMAD7 at 0,
1, 4, and 8 hours in KRJ-I cells in response to TGFb1
(1 ng/mL). SMAD4 expression was not changed by
TGFb1 at 1 hour but was decreased at 4–8 hours
(Fig. 4). In contrast, SMAD7 was significantly elevated at 1, 4, and 8 hours (Fig. 4). Densitometric
quantitation analysis of bands (Scion Image software) confirmed that SMAD4 was decreased 16% to
31% (P < .05 vs 0 hour: no stimulation by TGFb1)
and demonstrated that SMAD7 was elevated 18% to
24% (P < .05 vs 0 hour). These results indicate that
TGFb1 decreased expression of SMAD4—an obligatory factor for SMAD complex nuclear targeting,
whereas SMAD7—an inhibitor of SMAD nuclear targeting, was increased. This provides a potential
mechanism for blockade of the TGFb1-cytostatic
program; pSMAD2 nuclear targeting would be predicted to be decreased after these SMAD alterations.

Effect of TGFb1 on P21WAF1/CIP1 and c-Myc Expression
To confirm evidence of alterations in TGFb signaling,
we next assessed transcript and protein levels of

and 240 minutes and Western blot analysis at 0 1, 4,
8, and 24 hours. Levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 were decreased by TGFb1 (1 ng/mL) from 60 minutes and
did not return to prestimulated levels (Fig. 5A). Protein levels, in contrast, did not change between 0
and 8 hours, but by 24 hours P21WAF1/CIP1 was no
longer detectable.
To examine altered regulation of c-Myc, a common mechanism for loss of a cytostatic response to
TGFb1,11,47–49 we measured transcript and protein
levels in response to TGFb1 (1 ng/mL). TGFb1 stimulated c-myc transcription (Fig. 5B) and protein levels
in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 5C).
Evidence That TGFb1 Activates Non-SMAD Pathways
in KRJ-I Cells
Phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1/2 pathway results in inhibition of TGFb1 growth inhibitory
signals by preventing nuclear accumulation of
SMADs.50 We measured activation of ERK1/2 in KRJ-I
cells after incubation with TGFb1 (1 ng/mL) for 0–240
minutes. TGFb1 resulted in a significant initial
increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 at 30 minutes

that was sustained for 2 hours and thereafter
declined by 4 hours (Fig. 6). Preincubation with
PD98059 (30 lM) inhibited TGFb-activated ERK1/2
phosphorylation, which demonstrates that TGFb1
activates the MAPK growth regulatory cascade via
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in neoplastic cells. This
may also contribute to the decreased nuclear
pSMAD2 translocation noted in KRJ-I cells incubated
with TGFb1.

TGFb1-Mediated Increases in Expression of
Metastasis-Associated Genes
To examine whether TGFb1 signaling was associated
with transcriptional regulation of malignancy-associated genes in the KRJ-I cell line, we examined the
effects of TGFb1 on MTA1 and E-cadherin expression
and compared this to normal EC cells. TGFb1 stimulated expression of MTA1 transcript (Fig. 7A) and
decreased E-cadherin expression (Fig. 7B) in neoplastic cells but had no significant effect on gene expression in normal cells. Stimulating neoplastic cells with

TGFb1 therefore alters the expression of 2 well-characterized malignancy-associated factors, an observation consistent with an additional role (beyond
proliferation) of TGFb1 signaling in neoplastic EC
cells.

DISCUSSION
The investigation of TGFb pathway alterations in tumor cells has yielded significant mechanistic information regarding the regulation of different kinds of
neoplasia and provided mechanistic explanations as
to the basis of the evolution of a malignant phenotype.11,13,30 In the current study, we examined the
effect of TGFb1 on a neoplastic small intestinal EC
cell-derived cell line, KRJ-I, and demonstrated that in
neoplastic EC cells TGFb1: 1) increased cell proliferation as opposed to inhibiting it; 2) decreased expression of SMAD4 but increased expression of the
inhibitor of SMAD nuclear translocation, SMAD7; 3)
down-regulated p21WAF1/CIP1 transcript, a regulator of
the cytostatic program; 4) increased expression of c-

Myc, an oncogene involved in evasion of TGFb1mediated growth inhibition and a transcription factor
that up-regulates malignancy-associated genes; 5)
resulted in phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/
2, a growth stimulatory pathway that also is involved
in evasion of TGFb1-mediated growth inhibition via
negative regulation of pSMAD nuclear targeting; and
6) caused downstream activation of the malignancydefining genes MTA1 and E-cadherin.
A cytostatic role for TGFb1 on normal endocrine
or neuroendocrine cell proliferation (eg, lactotrope,
pituitary, parathyroid, and chromaffin cell) has been
identified.51–53 In contrast, tumors from these organs
demonstrate a loss of cytostasis and respond to
TGFb1 with proliferation.52 Our examination of normal neuroendocrine (EC) cells from the small intestine and the small intestinal EC cell line, KRJ-I,
demonstrate a similar phenomenon: normal cells
can be growth-inhibited by TGFb1, whereas neoplastic neuroendocrine cells lose TGFb1-mediated cytostasis. Further examination of the TGFb1 pathway in
the neoplastic cell line demonstrated low expression
levels (mRNA and protein) of nonmutated TGFbRII
but SMAD2 could be phosphorylated in response to

TGFb1-mediated stimulation. These results indicate
an intact TGFb1:TGFbRII interaction. However, in
contrast to normal EC cells, which demonstrated nuclear targeting of pSMAD2 after TGFb1 stimulation,
nuclear pSMAD2 positivity was barely detectable in
KRJ-I cells (<7%). These data suggest that TGFb1mediated signal transduction in a small intestinal
carcinoid cell line, as in glioma cell lines,54 is blocked
at the level of SMAD nuclear translocation.
To investigate this, we examined transcript
expression of a number of candidate factors in this
pathway. Both SMAD4 and SMAD7 transcript levels
were elevated in KRJ-I compared with normal EC
cells, whereas ELF was decreased. These differences
provide a potential mechanism for a decrease in nuclear pSMAD2 targeting because ELF is critical for
SMAD2 translocation,46 whereas SMAD7 is an antagonist of this process.11
To examine this in more detail, we then determined the effect of TGFb1 on SMAD4 and SMAD7
protein expression. These quantitative studies
demonstrated that TGFb1 decreased SMAD4 expression, whereas it increased SMAD7 levels. TGFb1mediated alterations in SMAD expression have been
noted in the human lymphoma cell line HT58, where
SMAD7 expression was stimulated by TGFb1.55 In
addition, other cell lines (head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma) that are resistant to TGFb1-mediated
cytostatic also exhibit high expression of SMAD7.56
An increased expression of this inhibitory SMAD may
be important because SMAD7 blocks TGFb-induced
growth inhibition by inhibiting TGFb-mediated
down-regulation of c-Myc, CDK4, and Cyclin D1, and
suppresses the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1.57 SMAD7
up-regulation has also been associated with
increased tumorigenicity of human colonic carcinoma FET cells.57
To examine the importance of alterations in
SMADs, we analyzed transcription of P21WAF1/CIP1
and c-Myc in the KRJ-I cell line. Our studies demonstrated that loss of TGFb1 responsiveness in KRJ-I
was associated with decreased p21WAF1/CIP1 and
increased c-Myc transcription. P21WAF1/CIP1 expression levels are increased in cell lines treated with
TGFb1 that have intact TGFb1-mediated cytostatic
pathways,58,59 and may be unaltered in glioma cell
lines that have lost this responsiveness.54 In the current study, p21WAF1/CIP1 transcription and protein was
decreased. KRJ-I cells express time-dependent
increases in both transcript and protein expression
of c-Myc in response to TGFb1 treatment. A similar
inability to down-regulate c-Myc has been demonstrated in esophageal cells line that have lost responsiveness to TGFb1.60

2429

Elevations in c-Myc may be responsible for a
loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 transcriptional response because
induction of c-Myc is associated with blockade of
TGFb1-mediated p21WAF1/CIP1 transcription and
down-regulation of basal P21WAF1/CIP1 levels.61 In
addition, repression of P21WAF1/CIP1 has been demonstrated to play a role in c-Myc-dependent cell cycle
progression.61 Based on our studies and this information, we postulate that neoplastic EC cells use the
TGFb1 transcriptional pathway to up-regulate c-Myc
and inhibit P21WAF1/CIP1 with a resultant increase in
cell proliferation and concomitant activation of cMyc transcriptional targets.
MTA1 is an important component in c-Myc activity as 1 of its first downstream targets and appears
essential for the transformation potential of this
oncogene.62 In the current studies, MTA1 transcription was up-regulated by TGFb1 in a time frame consistent with c-Myc activation. We postulate that this
metastasis factor, recently shown to be overexpressed
in malignant primary GI carcinoids and their metastases27,63 and linked to a worse prognosis in EC cellderived appendiceal tumors,28 is up-regulated by
TGFb1 or the TGFb1-pathway in neoplastic EC cells
and plays a role in malignant transformation and
metastasis.
E-cadherin expression was reduced by TGFb1 in
the KRJ-I cell line. TGFb1 treatment has been shown
to decrease E-cadherin levels and cause redistribution of b-catenin in intestinal epithelial cells,64 suggesting that TGFb1 functions to regulate cell
migration and metastasis. Reduced expression of Ecadherin correlates with malignant behavior of GI carcinoids21 and it appears that TGFb1 pathway alteration
of the E-cadherin expression represents a mechanistic
component of the malignant evolution.
This study demonstrates that the classical TGFb1mediated cytostatic pathway is not functional in the
KRJ-I cell line. Our data indicates that neoplastic EC cells
utilize a relatively intact TGFb1 transcriptional network
to drive cell proliferation via c-Myc activation. An alternative or additional mechanism is provided by the ability
of TGFb1 to cross-associate/activate another pathway,
the ERK pathway.11 Our experiments confirm this event
and, because phosphorylation of ERK1/2 results in activation of the MAPK growth regulatory cascade, it is plausible that the growth stimulatory effects of TGFb1 noted
in neoplastic EC cells reflects such cross-activity. It is notable that a recent report suggests that an activated ERK
pathway is a feature of many GI carcinoids.29
In summary, the results of the current study
demonstrate that alterations in expression and function of SMADs in the KRJ-I cell line result in a
decreased expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and up-regulation

of c-Myc and altered regulation of carcinoid malignancy-associated factors. These data support the hypothesis that an escape from TGFb1-mediated growth
inhibition occurs in small intestinal carcinoids. The
molecular delineation of TGFb1-mediated proliferative
regulation of this small intestinal carcinoid cell line
provides an opportunity to identify alterations in
TGFb1 signaling. This information may be of some use
to predict prognosis in small intestinal carcinoids, as
has been described with regard to expression levels of
SMAD4 in head and neck squamous cell, breast, and
hepatocellular carcinomas.65–67 More important, it
appears likely that further examination of the ubiquitous TGFb pathway in neuroendocrine tumors may
provide alternative targets to regulate proliferation.
