ABSTRACT
This study compared the short-term efficacies of different chemotherapy
regimens in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) through pair-wise
and network meta-analyses (NMA). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified
in a comprehensive online literature search met our inclusion criteria. Direct and
indirect evidence was combined to compare odds ratios (OR) and surfaces under
the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) across the different treatment regimens.
Twelve eligible RCTs were finally included, involving eight regimens (Paclitaxel +
Carboplatin [PC], Gemcitabine + Carboplatin [GC], Carboplatin, Pegylated Liposomal
Doxorubicin + Carboplatin [PLD + Carboplatin], Paclitaxel, Paclitaxel + Carboplatin +
Topotecan [PC + Topotecan], Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Epirubicin [PC + Epirubicin]
and Docetaxel + Carboplatin [DC]). The NMA results revealed that in terms of overall
response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR), PC (ORR: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.20–
6.22; DCR: OR=2.58, 95%CI=1.05–6.82) and GC (ORR: OR=2.08, 95%CI=1.08–4.37;
DCR: OR=2.43, 95%CI=1.07–5.80) were more effective against AOC than Carboplatin
alone. Similarly, PC (OR=0.21, 95%CI=0.05–0.69), GC (OR=0.31, 95%CI=0.09–0.90)
and PLD + Carboplatin (OR=0.22, 95%CI=0.04–0.92) slowed disease progression
better than Carboplatin alone. We also found that PC was more efficacious against AOC
than Carboplatin or Paclitaxel single-agent chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy
is thus recommended for AOC, and should guide subsequent drug development and
treatment strategies.

with stage III and IV disease, with 10-year survival rates of
21% and <5%, respectively [6]. Thus, early diagnosis and
timely treatment are of crucial importance in overcoming
this disease.
Chemotherapy is still a commonly used approach
in OC treatment. With respect to mechanism of action,
such chemotherapeutics may selectively modify and
inhibit their targets. For instance, Epirubicin inhibits cell
division through inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis
[7], and Docetaxel aids T cell in recognizing tumor cells
via modification of the tumor phenotype [8]. Alternatively,
chemotherapy drugs may exert toxic effects on tumor
cells, inducing cell damage or disruption of tumor cell
differentiation; such drugs include Paclitaxel [9] and
Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) [10]. Other
OC chemotherapeutics, such as Gemcitabine [11] and
Topotecan [12], inhibit specific signaling pathways and

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer (OC) is the second most common
gynecological cancer in women, after endometrial cancer
[1]. Some 238,719 OC cases were reported in 2012, with
151,917 deaths worldwide [2]. Although the etiology of
OC is not yet fully understood, certain factors, including
age, late childbearing, early onset at menarche, late
menopause, and breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast
cancer 2 (BRCA2) mutations, are implicated in OC
formation and development [3, 4]. Environmental factors
also play roles in OC promotion, and include dietary
habits, air pollution, alcohol consumption, and pathogen
infection [5]. In addition, lack of early diagnosis may be a
key factor in disease progression. According to a previous
study, only 25% of patients were diagnosed with earlystage OC while 58% and 17% of cases were diagnosed

certain cell functions in tumor cells. Combination therapy
has been widely recommended for OC patient treatment.
Cisplatin or Carboplatin is usually combined with alkyl
compounds like Cyclophosphamide. While Cisplatin
and Carboplatin are equally efficacious, Carboplatin is
less toxic than Cisplatin. Thus, Carboplatin is commonly
used in combination with Paclitaxel [13] or PLD [14].
Nevertheless, few studies have compared and evaluated
the efficacy of different first-line regimens in treating
OC. With the introduction of these therapeutic options,
and the lack of randomized trials that directly compare
all available chemotherapy regimens, it was of interest to
indirectly compare the relative efficacy and safety of these
chemotherapy regimens using a network meta-analysis
[15-16].
Network meta-analysis is also known as multipletreatments comparison and can synthesize data from
both direct (within-trial comparisons) as well as indirect
comparisons (inter-trial treatment comparisons using
a common comparator treatment) of diverse regimens
[17]. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach can estimate
the rank probability that, each of the regimens is the best,
the second best, and so on [18]. It is highly advocate
that investigators should consider all potentially relevant
data when comparing treatments and multiple-treatment
comparisons is consistent with the true situation when
using a wide network of studies that are included
appropriately [19]. This study included RCTs published up
to December 2015 involving eight chemotherapy regimens
for advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) treatment including
Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, Paclitaxel + Carboplatin (PC),
Gemcitabine + Carboplatin (GC), PLD + Carboplatin,
PC + Topotecan, PC + Epirubicin and Docetaxel +
Carboplatin (DC). It is believed that this network metaanalysis can provide some useful information about
comparison between these first-line regimens agents for
AOC through integrating and indirect methods, expecting
this message will be helpful for physicians and patients in
decision-making.

PC chemotherapy regimen. The included RCTs were
published between 2004 and 2015, and all were twoarm trials. Eleven out of 12 assessed Caucasians and one
assessed Asians. RCT baseline characteristics are provided
in Supplementary Table 1 and bias assessment by the
Cochrane Collaboration’s tool is shown in Supplementary
Figure 2.

Pairwise meta-analysis
The short-term efficacy of eight AOC chemotherapy
regimens was assessed via direct paired comparisons as
follows: (1) ORR and DCR: PC was more effective than
PC + Topotecan (OR=1.43, 95%CI=1.12–1.83; OR=1.40,
95%CI=1.08–1.81, respectively), and GC had better
outcomes than Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy
(OR=2.00, 95%CI=1.30–3.08; OR=2.25, 95%CI=1.51–
4.30, respectively); (2) ORR: PC was more effective
than Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy (OR=3.10,
95%CI=1.21–7.79); (3) PD: combination chemotherapy,
such as PC or GC, slowed disease progression more
effectively than Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy
(OR=0.11, 95%CI=0.02–0.51; OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.22–
0.86, respectively) (Table 1); (4) CR: GC resulted in better
outcomes than Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy
(OR=2.60, 95%CI=1.24–5.43); (5) SD: PC was more
effective than PC + Epirubicin (OR=1.94, 95%CI=1.03–
3.67). In terms of PR, all eight AOC treatment regimens
performed the same (Supplementary Table 2).

Network evidence
The majority of patients received the PC regimen.
With respect to CR, PR, ORR, PD, SD, and DCR
assessment, there were more direct paired comparisons
performed for the PC and PLD + Carboplatin regimens
than for the other regimens (Figure 1).

Inconsistency tests
Inconsistency tests were performed via the nodesplitting method for the six endpoint outcomes (CR, PR,
ORR, PD, SD, and DCR). Direct and indirect evidences
showed consistency for all endpoint outcomes, and so the
consistency model was adopted (both P>0.05) (Table 2).

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of included studies
The reviewers initially identified 2,664 records from
database searches, of which 2,578 and 86 were collected
via key word searches and manual retrieval, respectively.
We excluded 51 duplicate studies, 633 letters or reviews,
175 non-human studies, and 155 non-English language
publications. From the remaining 1,650 studies, we further
excluded 678 non-cohort studies, 583 irrelevant to AOC,
373 unrelated to chemotherapy, and 4 for no available
data or missing data. Finally, 12 RCTs met our inclusion
criteria and were deemed eligible for meta-analysis [2031] (Supplementary Figure 1). The study included 6,187
patients with AOC, the majority of whom received the

Network meta-analyses
The NMA revealed that PC showed higher efficacy
in the treatment of AOC than Carboplatin (ORR [overall
response rate]: OR=2.59, 95%CI =1.20~6.22; DCR
[disease control rate]: OR=2.58, 95%CI=1.05~6.82). As
also compared to the Carboplatin, GC exhibited higher
efficacy in the treatment of AOC (ORR: OR=2.08, 95%CI
=1.08~4.37; DCR: OR=2.43, 95%CI=1.07~5.80). With
respect to PD, PC, GC, and PLD + Carboplatin slowed
disease progression more effectively than Carboplatin

single-agent chemotherapy (OR=0.21, 95%CI=0.05–0.69;
OR=0.31, 95%CI=0.09–0.90; OR=0.22, 95%CI=0.04–

AOC than the other regimens. PC is a relatively common
first-line chemotherapy regimen. Carboplatin, a commonly
used adjuvant with acceptable toxicities, has shown great
efficacy in combination therapy [32]. Pacilitaxel promotes
stable microtubule assembly by acting specifically at
the beta-tubulin subunit N-terminus [33], impeding
depolymerization and inhibiting cancer cell division [9].
In terms of progression-free survival, previous studies
showed that PC was more efficacious than GC [23],
while no difference was detected when PC was compared
to PLD + Carboplatin [20, 34], PC + Topotecan [35],
PC + Epirubicin [36, 37] or DC [26]. According to our
NMA SUCRA values, PC produced better outcomes
with regard to CR, PD and DCR, while DC was more
effective regarding ORR and PC + Epirubicin had a higher
efficacy in terms of DCR. These results are consistent
with previous studies [26, 37, 38,], demonstrating there
was no efficacy difference between PC, PC + Epirubicin,
and DC. However, some studies indicated that toxicity
was lower in PC as compared to PC + Epirubicin [37],
PC + Topotecan [38], and DC [26]. Epirubicin inhibits
DNA and RNA synthesis by intercalating DNA strands [7]
and Topotecan inhibits cancer cell differentiation through
PPARγ degradation [12], which disturbs the normal
processes of cell division and differentiation, and impedes
cell damage repair,. The mechanisms underlying high DC
toxicity have not yet been reported. In sum, PC exhibited
reduced toxicity and fewer side effects as compared to the
other studied regimens.
Both pairwise meta-analysis and NMA indicated
that Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy was less
effective than the other regimens. Carboplatin, a Cisplatin
analogue, is widely used as an adjuvant drug for cancer
treatment due to its lower toxicity and reduced side
effects [39]. Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy was
reportedly highly effective and well tolerated in patients
with early stage cancer, and was suitable for long-term use
[40]. However, for patients with advanced-stage cancer,
Carboplatin alone might be less effective than other
regimens [20]. Previous studies showed that combination

With respect to the six endpoint outcomes, the
efficacies of all eight AOC chemotherapy regimens were
determined via SUCRA values, with the following results:
(1) PC had the highest SUCRA values in terms of CR
(74.0%), PD (69.6%) and DCR (74.0%); (2) Paclitaxel
showed the highest SUCRA value with respect to PR
(73.4%); (3) DC (73.1%) ranked highest in terms of ORR,
followed by PC (73.0%); (4) PC + Epirubicin had the
highest SUCRA value for SD (80.8%); (5) Carboplatin
single-agent chemotherapy had the lowest SUCRA
values for all six endpoint outcomes (CR: 19.5%; PR:
22.9%; ORR: 15.6%; SD: 31.0%; PD: 14.8; DCR: 19.5%)
(Table 4).

Cluster analyses
Cluster analyses of ORR, PD and DCR SUCRA
values showed that PC had the highest efficacy against
AOC, followed by DC, while Carboplatin single-agent
chemotherapy had the lowest efficacy (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
In this study, direct pairwise meta-analyses and
NMA were conducted to compare and evaluate the
efficacies of eight widely used chemotherapy regimens
(Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy, Paclitaxel singleagent chemotherapy, PC, GC, PLD + Carboplatin, PC +
Topotecan, PC + Epirubicin and DC) in the treatment of
AOC. Direct pairwise meta-analysis and NMA results
showed that the PC regimen was more effective in treating

MATERIALS AND METHODS

chemotherapy, such as PC or GC, was more effective than
Carboplatin alone [30, 41]. Therefore, Carboplatin should
be combined with other drugs to treat advanced cancer
patients.
In addition, as the toxicity of the eight chemotherapy
regimens was mentioned above, the adverse events
also are an object of concern. There were very little or
no patients received PC in the moderate, severe or life
threating degrees of adverse events including allergy,
anorexia, arthralgia, fatigue, febrile neutropenia,
nausea, neurotoxicity, mucositis, vomiting, thrombosis
and haemoglobin [24]. And patients treated by GC
had more frequent hematologic toxicities of grade
three or four than carboplatin, in which neutropenia
was the predominant toxicity [27]. Whilst, the early
discontinuation leaded by severe nonhematologic toxicity,
grade two or greater alopecia, hypersensitivity reactions
and sensory neuropathy occurred more frequently in the
patients received Paclitaxel and Carboplatin than PLD
+ Carboplatin [34]. Meanwhile, the risk of drug-related
serious adverse events was higher in the patients received
PC + Topotecan than those received PC [24]. And PC +
Epirubicin for AOC had more frequently occurrences of
grade three or four hematologic and some nonhematologic
toxicity (nausea/emesis, mucositis, and infections). than
DC [28]. However, the data of the adverse events of the
eight chemotherapy regimens was not very complete, so
the network comparison couldn’t be performed.
This meta-analysis was limited by several factors:
(1) the small number of included references restricts
the generality of the research results to some extent; (2)
cluster analysis results were not significant enough to
fully support the research summaries; (3) the data of the
safety outcomes was so incomplete in enrolled studies that
this study couldn’t give a statistical analysis to compare
the safety of eight chemotherapy regimens on AOC. In
support of the study’s conclusions: (1) this study included
a sufficiently large number of individual patient cases; (2)
various comparisons showed consistency; (3) our metaanalysis results were consistent with those of previous
studies.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that PC
was more effective against AOC than any of the other
studied regimens. Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy
was least effective. Thus, combination chemotherapy is
recommended for treatment of AOC, and this should guide
subsequent drug development and treatment strategies.
Also, our study highlights the value of network metaanalysis for the treatment of AOC, providing indirect
comparisons of multiple chemotherapy regimens for more
valuable, comprehensive and complete results. Compared
with a traditional meta-analysis, a network meta-analysis
enables indirect comparison using a common comparator
when a head-to-head trial is not accessible and also
combines direct and indirect comparisons simultaneously
for comparing several interventions.

Literature search
A comprehensive literature search was performed
online in Cochrane Library (from 1996 to December
2015) and PubMed (from April 2000 to December
2015). The search strategy was based on keywords and
free words including ovarian cancer, pharmacotherapy,
chemotherapy, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and Gemcitabine,
etc., in the combination with the Boolean logic AND, OR
and NOT. Specific search strategy as follows: (((“Ovarian
Neoplasms”[mh] OR Ovarian Malignant Tumor[tiab]
OR Ovarian Cancer[tiab] OR Ovary Cancer[tiab] OR
Cancer, Ovarian[tiab] OR Cancer of Ovary[tiab])) AND
(“Drug Therapy”[mh] OR Medication Errors[tiab]
OR Drug Administration Routes[tiab] OR Opiate
Substitution Treatment[tiab] OR Polypharmacy [tiab] OR
Medicine[tiab] OR Antineoplastic Drugs[tiab] OR Cancer
Chemotherapy Agents[tiab] OR Anticancer Agents[tiab]
OR Antitumor Agents[tiab] OR Chemotherapeutic
Anticancer Drug[tiab])) AND (“randomized controlled
trial”[pt] OR “controlled clinical trial”[pt] OR
“randomized controlled trials as topic”[Mesh] OR “clinical
trials as topic”[mh] OR “controlled clinical trials as

OR “double-blind method”[mh] OR randomized[tiab]
OR placebo[tiab] OR randomization[tiab] OR randomly
allocated[tiab] OR ((double[tw] OR treble[tw] OR
triple[tw]) AND (mask* [tw] OR blind* [tw]))). A
manual search was also conducted to identify additional
potentially relevant references.

Study selection
Inclusion criteria included: (1) study design:
randomized controlled trial (RCT); (2) interventions:
Carboplatin single-agent chemotherapy, Paclitaxel singleagent chemotherapy, PC, GC, PLD + Carboplatin singleagent chemotherapy, PC + Topotecan, PC + Epirubicin, or
DC; (3) study subject: AOC patients aged 19 – 89 years;
(4) endpoints: complete response (CR), partial response
(PR), overall response rate (ORR), progressive disease
(PD), stable disease (SD), and disease control rate (DCR).
Exclusion criteria included: (1) studies with insufficient
data, such as non-paired studies; (2) non-RCTs; (3)
duplicated publications; (4) meeting reports, systematic
reviews or abstracts; (5) references irrelevant to AOC; (6)
non-English publications; (7) non-human studies; (8) nondrug regimens.

Data extraction and quality assessment
RCT data were extracted by independent reviewers
using a form designed for this study. Four researchers
conducted data extraction; Xi-Ping Jiang and Xiao-Hui
Rui were responsible for the extraction of baseline data,

while the depth data was extracted by Cai-Xia Guo and
Yun Xu. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion
with Xi-Ping Jiang, Xiao-Hui Rui, Cai-Xia Guo and Yun
Xu. The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool was used by more
than two of our study authors to assess the risk of bias
in each included RCT, including potential sources of
bias included random allocation, allocation concealment,
blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome
reporting, and other biases. Each potential bias source was
assigned a judgment of “yes”, “no”, or “unclear” for each
RCT. Then, the number of “unclear” or “no” judgments
was calculated, and each RCT was classified as having a
low, high, or unclear risk of bias as follows: 0–1, low risk;
2–3, moderate risk; ≥4, high risk [42]. Review Manager
5 (RevMan 5.2.3, Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK)
was employed for quality assessment and investigation of
publication bias.

The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

First, direct comparisons across different treatment
arms were performed using a traditional pairwise metaanalysis. Odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were used to pool the estimates of intervention
effects. Heterogeneity across different studies was
examined using Chi-square and I-square tests [43].
Second, results were presented as a network plot in R
version 3.2.1, with each node representing an intervention.
Node sizes were associated with sample sizes, and the
thickness of the line connecting any two nodes indicated
the number of included studies. Third, comparisons of
different treatments were executed using Bayesian NMA.
According to non-informative priors, effect sizes and
precision were specified in each analysis. Convergence
and lack of auto-correlation were explored and verified
after four chains and a 20,000-simulation burn-in phase,
and direct probabilities were determined in an additional
50,000-simulation phase [44]. The node-splitting method
was used for selection of a consistency or inconsistency
model, via evaluation of the consistency between direct
and indirect evidence [45]. For the interpretation of ORs,
the probability of each treatment being the most effective
or safest was calculated using a Bayesian approach, and
probability values were estimated by the surface under
the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve and the rank of
each intervention [46, 47]. Cluster analyses were used to
group treatments according to their similarity with regard
to both outcomes [46]. All analyses were executed using
R (V.3.2.1) package gemtc (V.0.6) with the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo engine Open BUGS (V.3.4.0).
