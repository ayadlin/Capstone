Abstract
We have found previously that acquired doxorubicin resistance in a genetically engineered mouse model for
BRCA1-related breast cancer was associated with increased
expression of the mouse multidrug resistance (Mdr1) genes,
which encode the drug efflux transporter ATP-binding
cassette B1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Here, we show that even
moderate increases of Mdr1 expression (as low as 5-fold) are
sufficient to cause doxorubicin resistance. These moderately
elevated tumor P-gp levels are below those found in some
normal tissues, such as the gut. The resistant phenotype could
be completely reversed by the third-generation P-gp inhibitor
tariquidar, which provides a useful strategy to circumvent
this type of acquired doxorubicin resistance. The presence of
MDR1A in drug-resistant tumors with a moderate increase in
Mdr1a transcripts could be shown with a newly generated
chicken antibody against a mouse P-gp peptide. Our data
show the usefulness of realistic preclinical models to
characterize levels of Mdr1 gene expression that are sufficient
to cause resistance. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6396–404]

Introduction
The anthracycline doxorubicin is frequently used in standard
adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative chemotherapy regimens for
breast cancer patients (1). Doxorubicin increases the levels of
(double-stranded) DNA breaks resulting in cell death. Spontaneous
mammary tumors deficient in the error-free homology-directed
repair of DNA damage are especially sensitive to this drug (2).
However, successful chemotherapy of breast cancer is hampered
by the development of multidrug resistance. As underlying cause,
a range of different mechanisms has been identified, including
alterations in drug target, drug accumulation/metabolism, DNA
repair, or cell death pathways (3–6). For several of these
mechanisms, their relevance to resistance in real tumors is sparse
(7–10). One of the best-characterized mechanisms of multidrug
resistance in vitro is drug efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters such as ABCB1/MDR1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp), ABCG2/
BCRP, or ABCC1/MRP1 (3). P-gp is present in the apical membrane

of many different normal cells and its substrate specificity is broad
(11, 12). Nevertheless, whether P-gp is relevant for clinical
multidrug resistance of breast cancers is still debated (13–15).
One issue that feeds the argument is the difficulty to detect P-gp
in situ using formalin-fixed tumor samples. Another issue is that
inhibitors of P-gp have only yielded a modest benefit in the clinic.
First-generation, nonspecific inhibitors, such as verapamil and
cyclosporine A, did not reach clinically effective plasma levels
necessary for P-gp inhibition (16). Second-generation inhibitors,
such as PSC 833 (valspodar), were more potent and selective, but
their pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs often necessitated
reductions of doses of the anticancer drugs. A more selective thirdgeneration P-gp inhibitor is tariquidar (XR9576, Avaant; ref. 17).
In several studies, no clinically relevant interactions with pharmacokinetics of agents such as doxorubicin, vincristine, paclitaxel, or
vinorelbine were detected, although (moderate) increases in
chemotherapy side effects were observed in patients (18).
We have recently investigated anticancer drug responses in a
genetically engineered mouse model for hereditary breast cancer
(K14cre;Brca1 F/F ;p53 F/F ; refs. 2, 19). Mammary tumors that
spontaneously develop in this model mimic key features of breast
cancer 1 (BRCA1)–associated mammary carcinomas in humans.
An advantage of this mouse model is that these features as well as
the individual tumor gene expression profiles are preserved on
orthotopic grafting of small tumor fragments into syngeneic mice.
Because BRCA1 is essential for the repair of double-stranded
DNA breaks by homologous recombination, it is not surprising that
the Brca1 / /p53 / tumors tested were sensitive to the DNAinteracting drugs cisplatin, doxorubicin (2), topotecan,3 and
carboplatin or the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor
AZD2281 (20, 21). Nevertheless, tumors could not be eradicated
and eventually acquired resistance to each of the drugs tested, with
the exception of cisplatin and carboplatin. A major mechanism of
acquired doxorubicin and AZD2281 resistance in these tumors was
increased expression of the Mdr1a and Mdr1b (in short Mdr1)
genes, which encode the murine drug-transporting P-gp. High
Mdr1 expression was associated with increased washout of the
P-gp substrate 99mTc-sestamibi and cross-resistance to the taxane
docetaxel (2). Intriguingly, we found only low (f5-fold) increases
of Mdr1 transcripts in some tumors and wondered whether these
were sufficient to explain the resistant phenotype.
Here we report that a f5-fold increase above the average Mdr1a
and Mdr1b transcript levels of untreated tumors is sufficient to
cause doxorubicin resistance. Such amounts are far below

Moderate Increase in Mdr1a/1b Causes Doxorubicin Resistance

transcript quantities found in normal tissues such as the gut
(Mdr1a) or kidney and adrenals (Mdr1b). In several tumors
showing a moderate increase in Mdr1 gene expression, P-gp levels
could be detected with a newly generated polyclonal antibody.

Materials and Methods
Animals, generation of mammary tumors, and orthotopic transplantations into syngeneic wild-type mice. Doxorubicin-sensitive and
doxorubicin-resistant Brca1 / ;p53 / mammary tumors were generated
in K14cre;Brca1 F/F ;p53 F/F mice, genotyped, and orthotopically transplanted
as described (2, 22). Starting 2 weeks after tumor grafting, the onset of
tumor growth was checked at least three times a week. Mammary tumor
size was determined by caliper measurements (length and width in mm)
and tumor volume (in mm3) was calculated using the following formula:
0.5  length  width2. Animals were euthanized with CO2 when the tumor
volume reached 1,500 mm3. In addition to sterile collection of multiple
tumor pieces for grafting experiments, tumor samples were snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen and fixed in 4% formalin. All experimental procedures on
animals were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Netherlands
Cancer Institute.
Drugs. Doxorubicin (Adriblastina; Pharmacia Netherlands) was diluted
to 1 mg/mL in saline (Braun). Tariquidar (Avaant) was diluted in 5% glucose
such that the final volume administered by i.p. injection was 10 AL/g of
body weight.
Treatment of mammary tumor-bearing animals. When mammary
tumors reached a size of f200 mm3, 5 mg doxorubicin was given i.v. on day
0. Controls were left untreated. To avoid accumulating toxicity of repeated
drug injections, an additional treatment was not given after the recovery
time of 7 days when the tumor responded to the treatment (tumor size
<50% of the original volume, partial response). In this case, treatment was
resumed once the tumor relapsed to its original size (100%). For tumors
with a volume z50% after the recovery time, an additional treatment with
the same dose as mentioned above was given.
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis. Total
RNA and DNA were isolated from snap frozen tumor samples with Trizol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification (MLPA) reactions on DNA samples were
done as described4 and the employed oligos are indicated in Supplementary
Table S1. The integrity of RNA was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. For RNA quantification, reverse transcription-MLPA analysis comprising reverse transcription, hybridization, ligation, PCR amplification,
and fragment analysis by capillary electrophoresis was done as described
(2). To detect hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (Hprt1), we used
CAGGTCAGCAAAGAACT as reverse transcription primer (5¶-3¶) and
TCCTCATGGACTGATTATGGACAGGACTGAAAG, ACTTGCTCGAGATGTCATGAAGGAGATGGGAGGCCATCACA, and TTGTGGCCCTCTGTGTGCTCAAGGGGGGCTAT (5¶-3¶) as target-specific sequences for the ligation
reaction. For b2-microglobulin, CTGCGTGCATAAATTGTATAG (5¶-3¶) was
used in the reverse transcription reaction and CATGTGATCAAGCATCATGATGCTCTGAA and GATTCATTTGAACCTGCTTAATTACAAATCCAGTTTCTAATATG (5¶-3¶) for the ligation step.
5¶-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Total RNA was extracted from
four doxorubicin-resistant tumors and four untreated tumors. RNA was
quantified, and a standard 5¶-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5¶-RACE)
protocol was done to determine the transcriptional start site of Mdr1a and
Mdr1b transcripts. The Generacer kit was obtained from Invitrogen, and
5¶-RACE was done as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers were
designed to be within coding regions near the ATG start site. RACE
products were cloned into TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) and transformed
into bacteria. Multiple clones (at least 20 for each 5¶-RACE experiment) were
sequenced to build a repertoire of transcribed mRNA sequences expressed

we used the vinblastine-selected mouse macrophage cell lines J774.2 and
J7.V1 described by Greenberger and colleagues (23) and kindly provided by
C.P.H. Yang and Dr. Susan B. Horowitz (Albert Einstein College of Medicine).
Western blot analysis. Tumor samples were homogenized in 10 mmol/L
KCI, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), and 0.5% (w/v) SDS
supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche). DNA was sheared
by sonication, and samples containing 50 Ag protein were fractionated by
SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% Tris-glycine gel and then transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. After blotting, the membranes
were blocked for at least 1 h in TBS (10 mmol/L Tris, 100 mmol/L NaCl)
containing 5% milk powder and 0.05% Tween followed by an overnight
incubation at 4jC with the C219 antibody at 1.2 Ag/mL. Immunoreactivity
was visualized with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated rabbit anti-mouse
immunoglobulins (DakoCytomation; diluted 1:5,000) followed by enhanced
chemiluminescence detection.
LS9509 antibody. The sequences for mouse Mdr1a and Mdr1b genes
were analyzed by the algorithm of Hopp and Woods to determine potential
peptides for synthesis and antibody production. The peptides were then
BLASTed against the Swiss-Prot database to determine uniqueness and to
help predict the specificity of the resulting antibodies. Peptide
KMGKKSKKEKKEKKPAVSV was selected and synthesized, and chicken
polyclonal antisera were generated at Lifespan Biosciences. To allow for
peptide conjugation to the carrier protein, a cysteine residue was added to
the NH2 terminus of the peptides. The 77-day yolks were subjected to
peptide affinity purification, and the resulting antisera were then used as
primary antibody, termed LS9509.
Immunocytochemistry. LLC-PK1 and its corresponding P-gptransfected lines grown on slides were fixed with 20jC acetone for 40 s
and incubated in serum-free protein block (DakoCytomation) for 1 h. The
cells were then incubated overnight with PBS containing 1% bovine serum
albumin and a primary antibody, which was either LS9509 or C219
(Calbiochem) at a final protein concentration of 0.26 or 2.9 Ag/mL,
respectively. Slides were washed with PBS followed by subsequent
incubation with a biotin-coupled appropriate secondary antibody for
1 h at a dilution of 1:1,000 (v/v) and a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
conjugate (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. Immunoreactions were visualized with diaminobenzidine (Sigma), and the sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Immunofluorescence on tissue sections. Freshly cut 4-Am-thick frozen
sections of mouse tumor tissue were fixed with 20jC acetone for 10 min.
Sections were then blocked for avidin/biotin (DakoCytomation) for 10 min
and in serum-free protein block (DakoCytomation). For C219 immunofluorescence, additional blocking steps were introduced to remove nonspecific
interactions with mouse-on-mouse block (M.O.M kit; Vector Laboratories)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The tissue sections were then
incubated overnight at 4jC with primary antibodies (0.26 Ag/mL for the
LS9509 antibody or 11.6 Ag/mL for the C219 antibody). Slides were washed
with PBS followed by subsequent incubation with a biotin-coupled
appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at a dilution of 1:1,000 (v/v) and a
30-min incubation with streptavidin-Cy5 (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:50
(v/v) and finally a 5-min incubation with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to
stain the nuclei. The slides were washed with PBS as described above and
mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Molecular Probes). The Cy5
and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescence in the tissue sections was
analyzed with a Leica confocal AOBS fluorescence microscope.

published ratios of resistant tumors versus matched samples taken
before treatment (2), we determined Mdr1 gene expression levels in
doxorubicin-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant mouse mammary
tumors in comparison with selected normal tissues by reverse
transcription-MLPA. actinb, Hprt1, and b2-microglobulin were used
as reference and relative Mdr1 transcript levels were compared
with those of the liver, gut, adrenals, and kidney, which are known
to express P-gp. As shown in Fig. 1, the average level of Mdr1 RNA
in untreated tumors was comparable with that of the spleen.
Intriguingly, tumor 5 (T5), which has a 1.9- and 2.0-fold higher RNA
level than the average Mdr1a and Mdr1b of untreated tumors,
showed a stable disease in response to doxorubicin, whereas the
other tumors usually shrank in response to treatment (2). In the
resistant tumors, at least 2-fold increased Mdr1 RNA levels above
the Mdr1 average of untreated tumors were detected in 11 of 13
tumors (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S2). Mdr1a transcript levels

varied between those reached in the liver (T6doxres and T8doxres,
2- to 3-fold above the average of untreated tumors), duodenum
(T5doxres, T7doxres, and T*19doxres, 5- to 6-fold above the average
of untreated tumors), and ileum and large intestine (T*4doxres,
T*20doxres, T*22doxres, T*23doxres2, and T*23doxres3, up to
36-fold above the average of untreated tumors). Regarding Mdr1b
transcripts, only in two tumors (T*23doxres2 and T*23doxres4)
levels between those found in the kidney or adrenal glands were
measured (31- to 52-fold above the average of untreated tumors),
but none reached those found in the adrenal gland. In summary,
only one doxorubicin-resistant tumor (T*22doxres) had higher
Mdr1 RNA levels than some normal tissues.
On orthotopic transplantation into syngeneic animals, doxorubicin-resistant tumors kept their resistance phenotype or showed
only a slight delay in growth in the presence of doxorubicin (ref. 2;
Fig. 2), whereas the primary sensitive tumors shrank substantially

Moderate Increase in Mdr1a/1b Causes Doxorubicin Resistance

(2). To determine the importance of P-gp in doxorubicin-resistant
tumors, we pretreated the mice with the P-gp inhibitor tariquidar
(17). When 10 mg tariquidar/kg i.v. was given 15 min before
doxorubicin, animals could only tolerate four to five subsequent
treatments of the MTD of doxorubicin (5 mg/kg i.v., minimally
7 days recovery time). This is less than what can be administered
when doxorubicin is given as single agent (at least eight cycles are
usually tolerated). Histologic analysis of sacrificed animals after
repeated doxorubicin + tariquidar doses revealed bone marrow
depletion as the most likely cause of toxicity (data not shown).
After the initial injection on day 0 (volume f200 mm3), additional
treatments were given 7 days later in case the tumor size was >50%
of the size on day 0. In case the tumor regressed to a size below
50%, we resumed treatment when the tumor relapsed to 100%. As
shown in Fig. 2, P-gp inhibition successfully reversed doxorubicin
resistance in three individual tumors in which we found increased
Mdr1 mRNA levels. T*23doxres1, in which no Mdr1 increase was
observed (Fig. 1), showed only a small benefit of the pretreatment
with tariquidar. Despite the fact that tumors became sensitive

again to doxorubicin, they were not eradicated by the tariquidardoxorubicin combination.
Up-regulation of Mdr1 is not caused by gene amplification
in most tumors and does not correlate with differential
promoter usage of Mdr1a or Mdr1b. Amplification of MDR1 or
its rodent homologues has been observed in many multidrugresistant cell lines (reviewed in ref. 4). In contrast, we found no
increase in the DNA content of 12 of 13 doxorubicin-resistant
tumors relative to samples taken before tumor treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Only for T*23doxres4 a 1.8-fold increase
was identified. However, a small increase in Mdr1 copy number
might be difficult to detect in crude tumor samples. We therefore
enriched tumor cells from two doxorubicin-resistant tumors
(T*23doxres2 and T7doxres) by removing dead cells, endothelial,
fibroblastic, and hematopoietic (Lin+) cells after tumor dissociation. MLPA analysis of these Lin cells did not detect any Mdr1
amplification (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that
increased transcription of Mdr1 rather than gene amplification
drives the increased Mdr1 expression in most of the tumors.

Figure 2. Response of doxorubicin-resistant tumors to doxorubicin combined with tariquidar. Fragments of doxorubicin-resistant tumors with different increases of
Mdr1 transcripts (T*23doxres2, T*23doxres3, and T7doxres) or without detectable Mdr1 mRNA alterations (T*23doxres1) were transplanted orthotopically into
syngeneic mice and left untreated (dark blue ) or treated with 10 mg tariquidar/kg i.v. (turquoise ), 5 mg doxorubicin/kg i.v. (pink ), or 10 mg tariquidar/kg i.v. followed
15 min later by 5 mg doxorubicin/kg i.v. (green, orange , and brown ). In case tumors did not shrink <50%, animals were retreated after a recovery time of 7 d. Days
on which animals were retreated are indicated (open circles, triangles , or squares ). Where error bars (SD) are given, the data points represent the mean of three
individual animals. Due to the variability of relapsing tumors after tariquidar-doxorubicin combinations, the three individual curves are presented for T*23doxres2,
T*23doxres3, and T7doxres.

Two types of transcriptional activation of the human MDR1 gene
have been reported in human tumor samples and cell lines:
DNA rearrangements linking the MDR1 gene to a strong promoter
(24, 25) and activation of a ‘‘distal’’ promoter, 100 kb upstream of
the MDR1 gene (26, 27). In mouse cell lines, Mdr1 gene activation
may also occur by (defective) retrovirus insertion (28) or by DNA
rearrangements proposed to result from unequal sister chromatid
exchange mediated by LINE-1 repetitive elements (29). To test
whether any of these mechanisms apply in our resistant tumors, we
mapped the start of Mdr1a and Mdr1b transcripts using a 5¶-RACE
protocol, which allows cloning of 5¶-cap-linked sequences. The
results obtained for the capped transcripts of four individual
doxorubicin-resistant tumors and their matched doxorubicinsensitive controls are presented in Fig. 3. Both for Mdr1a and
Mdr1b we find a range of transcripts starting at a proximal
promoter, 132 to 186 nucleotides upstream of the ATG in the case
of Mdr1a and 116 to 186 nucleotides for Mdr1b. These start sites
approximately coincide with transcriptional start positions found
previously for Mdr1a (30, 31) and Mdr1b (32, 33) in cell lines and
normal tissues. In our model, there is no obvious difference
between the exact start sites of resistant and sensitive tumors.
For Mdr1a, we also find transcripts starting far upstream of the
gene. We find these in four individual tumors, all starting at
position 8567101 bp of chromosome 5.5 Remarkably, in this limited
analysis of a small number of tumors, we see no correlation
between the use of this distal promoter and Mdr1a up-regulation.
In two drug-sensitive tumors (T*20 and T*22) and one drugresistant tumor without detectable Mdr1a up-regulation
(T*23doxres4), we find a transcript from the distal promoter,
whereas among the three tumors with Mdr1a up-regulation we
only see a distal promoter transcript in T4doxres. Even from this
limited set of tumors, it is clear that the up-regulation of Mdr1a is
not specifically associated with activation of a distal promoter in
our mouse mammary tumors, in contrast to what was observed in
human tumors/cell lines (26, 34). A distal promoter for Mdr1a, not
identical to the one identified here, has only been found in one set
of vinblastine-selected mouse macrophage cell lines (30).
Detection of MDR1A with a new mouse-specific antibody.
We determined the amount of P-gp by Western blotting and/or
immunofluorescence with a range of mouse- and human-specific
antibodies such as C219 (Calbiochem), 265/F4, 4E3, Ab36743, and
SPM137 (all from Abcam), NH211 (35), 15D3 (36), and UIC2
(Chemicon). Of the antibodies tested, the C219 monoclonal
antibody (37), which is one of the most frequently used to detect
human and mouse P-gp (38, 39), was the most sensitive in
detecting mouse MDR1A and MDR1B in LLC-PK1 polarized pig
kidney cells transfected with the Mdr1 genes (ref. 40; Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). In tumors with at least 25-fold higher
Mdr1 transcripts than untreated tumors (T4doxres, T*22doxres,
T*23doxres2, and T*23doxres4), P-gp was detected by Western
blotting using C219 (Supplementary Fig. S3), although this
antibody also bound nonspecifically to other proteins, as indicated
by multiple bands. In several tumors with a moderate increase in
Mdr1 expression (T5doxres, T6doxres, T7doxres, and T*23doxres3),
however, we did not detect clearly more P-gp than in the
untreated doxorubicin-sensitive tumors (T1, T2, T*22con, and
T*23con).

To improve the detection of mouse P-gp in situ, we raised a new
chicken polyclonal antibody using the peptide KMGKKSKKEKKEKKPAVSV, which corresponds to amino acids 17 to 35 of mouse
MDR1A (accession no. NP_035206). This NH2-terminal sequence
has a high homology to mouse MDR1B (18 of 19) and human
MDR1 (16 of 19). In our search for suitable peptides, we avoided
extracellular loops due to their increased risk of yielding
conformation-specific antibody binding. Moreover, we chose
KMGKKSKKEKKEKKPAVSV to avoid cross-reaction with MDR3/
ABCB4, as this complicates the use of C219, which reacts with the
core sequence VQEALD also present in ABCB4 (41, 42). When we
tested the resulting affinity-purified polyclonal LS9509 antibodies
on the transfected LLC-PK1 cells, only MDR1A could be detected
by immunocytochemistry, whereas MDR1B and human MDR1 were
not identified (Fig. 4A). Unfortunately, this antibody did not yield a
positive result on Western blot (data not shown). To evaluate the
suitability of LS9509 for immunostaining, we compared brain
sections of Mdr1 wild-type animals with those derived from
Mdr1 / animals (43). As illustrated in Fig. 4B, LS9509 stained
brain capillaries in wild-type but not in knockout animals.
When we probed our panel of doxorubicin-resistant tumors with
LS9509, we found that more tumors yielded plasma membrane
staining than with the C219 antibody (Supplementary Table S3): all
tumors with high levels of Mdr1a transcripts (T4doxres,
T*22doxres, and T23*doxres2) were positive. Of tumors with
moderate increase in Mdr1a, T5doxres, T7doxres, T*19doxres,
T*20doxres, and T*23doxres3 showed positive staining, whereas all
other doxorubicin-resistant tumors were negative. Figure 4C shows
representative examples of T*22doxres, T23*doxres2, and T5doxres
with corresponding controls. These results show that P-gp is
indeed expressed in tumors with a moderate transcriptional upregulation of Mdr1.

Discussion
In this study, we show that moderate increases in the expression
of Mdr1 genes encoding P-gp are sufficient to cause acquired
doxorubicin resistance in a realistic mouse model for BRCA1associated breast cancer. In several resistant tumors, Mdr1 mRNA
levels were only 5- to 13-fold above the average of Mdr1a or Mdr1b
in untreated tumors. The levels in the resistant tumors are
comparable with those found in the liver or duodenum of wildtype mice and we rarely found tumor levels exceeding those
normally found in the large intestine (Mdr1a) or kidneys (Mdr1b).
In normal tissues, reduced doxorubicin sensitivity has also P-gpindependent causes such as lack of proliferation or intact DNA
repair mechanisms. In the investigated tumors, we are confident
that these low levels of P-gp cause doxorubicin resistance, as
resistance could be reversed by the third-generation P-gp inhibitor
tariquidar. We conclude that in our tumor model P-gp plays a
pivotal role in causing drug resistance even in tumors with only a
5-fold increase in Mdr1a and Mdr1b mRNA. Our inability to
eradicate tumors by the tariquidar-doxorubicin combination might
be due to dormancy of residual tumor-initiating cells or other
mechanisms (44).
Thus far, it has been difficult to show a role for P-gp in drugresistant breast cancer in vivo. As an example, a meta-analysis of 31
breast cancer trials found P-gp expression in 41% of the tumors
and associated a 3-fold chemotherapy response reduction with the
presence of P-gp (45). Nevertheless, such studies need to be taken
with a grain of salt due to huge differences in the definition of what

Moderate Increase in Mdr1a/1b Causes Doxorubicin Resistance

Figure 3. Mdr1 5¶-RACE of doxorubicin-resistant and matched doxorubicin-sensitive tumors. A, Mdr1a products aligned to the sequence of Mdr1a . Numbers
(in nucleotides; nt ) indicate that each tumor (sensitive or resistant) expresses transcripts of various 5¶-untranslated region lengths. The long transcripts match to regions
containing canonical splice sites far upstream of the ATG start site, indicating that a distal transcriptional start site is used. All tumors (doxorubicin-resistant and
doxorubicin-sensitive) express transcripts that use either proximal transcription start sites or a mixture of proximal and distal transcriptional start sites. Levels of Mdr1a
RNA derived from these tumors are normalized to actinb, Hprt1 , and b2M . B, Mdr1b 5¶-RACE products aligned to the sequence of Mdr1b . Numbers (in nucleotides)
indicate that each tumor expresses transcripts of various 5¶-untranslated region lengths. All tumors (doxorubicin-resistant and doxorubicin-sensitive) express Mdr1b
transcripts that use a proximal transcription start site. Levels of Mdr1b RNA derived from these tumors are normalized to actinb, Hprt1 , and b2M .

constitutes a ‘‘P-gp positive’’ tumor. More recently, in a phase II
clinical trial, tariquidar showed limited ability to restore drug
sensitivity in 17 women with stage III to IV breast cancer who
progressed or had stable disease on anthracycline or taxane
therapy (46). Only the patient with the greatest increase in 99mTcsestamibi uptake, who also showed inducible P-gp expression,
responded partially to tariquidar-containing therapy. Clearly,
careful patient selection is necessary to increase potential benefit
from P-gp-inhibiting therapy. In vivo imaging using the P-gp
substrate 99mTc-sestamibi is one approach, and we also found
increased sestamibi washout in our doxorubicin-resistant tumor

model (2, 47). However, this tracer is not completely P-gp-specific
and other drug efflux pumps (e.g., MRP1; ref. 48) that are not
inhibited by P-gp-specific transport blockers could give a falsepositive result.
Another approach is in situ detection with P-gp-specific
antibodies. Our attempts to generate a more sensitive antibody
for staining mouse P-gp were partially successful: the new chickenderived LS9509 antibody detects only mouse MDR1A in situ. Still,
eight doxorubicin-resistant tumors, with at least 5-fold increased
Mdr1a transcript levels relative to untreated tumors, were scored
P-gp positive, whereas C219 detected P-gp only in one of these

tumors. Possibly, the use of the mouse-on-mouse block for C219 is
responsible for its reduced sensitivity. Although it remains possible
that other human-specific antibodies that lack mouse crossreactivity do a better job on human samples, it may be useful to
generate more sensitive tools to detect P-gp in tumor sections.
Besides new antibodies that are sensitive for both immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, signal amplification via a proximity ligation assay (49) is another option that could be tested and
optimized in our model.
Although our model mimics key features of BRCA1-associated
breast cancer, it does not represent the full heterogeneity of
treatment responses observed in breast cancer. We did not
observe intrinsic doxorubicin resistance of drug-naive tumors,
although stable or progressive disease is often found in response
to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy in humans. To what
extent increased P-gp expression contributes to primary chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer patients remains
questionable. The poor outcome of tariquidar pretreatment in
such patients (46) does not favor a key role for P-gp. An advantage
of our mouse model is that we can breed in Mdr1-null alleles (43)
to identify Mdr1-independent doxorubicin resistance mechanisms.
