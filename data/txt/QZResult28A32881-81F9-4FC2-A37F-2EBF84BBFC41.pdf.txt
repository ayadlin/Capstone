Abstract
Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is exploited for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Innate and acquired
resistance limits treatment efficacy; however, resistance
mechanisms are not well understood. Previously, using
WEHI7.2 murine thymic lymphoma cells, we found that
increasing the resistance to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by
catalase transfection or selection for H2O2 resistance caused
glucocorticoid resistance. This suggests the possibility that
increasing H2O2 sensitivity could sensitize the cells to
glucocorticoids. In other cell types, increasing manganese
superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) can increase intracellular
H2O2. The current study showed that increased expression of
MnSOD sensitized WEHI7.2 cells to glucocorticoid-induced
apoptosis and H2O2. Treatment of WEHI7.2 cells with the
catalytic antioxidant Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP5+), a manganoporphyrin,
mimicked the effects of increased MnSOD expression. MnTE-2PyP5+ also sensitized WEHI7.2 cells to cyclophosphamide and
inhibited cell growth; it had no effect on the WEHI7.2 cell
response to doxorubicin or vincristine. In primary follicular
lymphoma cells, MnTE-2-PyP5+ increased cell death due to
dexamethasone. Treatment of H9c2 cardiomyocytes with
MnTE-2-PyP5+ inhibited doxorubicin cytotoxicity. The profile
of MnTE-2-PyP5+ effects suggests MnTE-2-PyP5+ has potential
for use in hematologic malignancies that are treated with
glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. [Cancer

Introduction
Glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of lymphoid
malignancies because of their ability to induce apoptosis.
Unfortunately, innate and acquired resistance limits their efficacy.
Progress has been made in defining critical events for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (reviewed in refs. 1–3). Glucocorticoidinduced apoptosis requires binding of the steroid to a cytosolic
receptor. The steroid-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus,
where it acts as a transcriptional activator and repressor of gene

networks. This results in a complex and poorly understood
interaction of signals that decides the life or death of the cell.
Apoptosis then proceeds through the release of cytochrome c from
the mitochondria and activation of caspases.
Clinically, some cases of glucocorticoid resistance have been
traced to nonfunctional (or decreased) glucocorticoid receptors
(4, 5); however, this mechanism may be relatively rare (5).
Glucocorticoid-induced release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria seems to be controlled by the relative amount of
proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (6–8).
Inability to appropriately up-regulate the proapoptotic Bcl-2
family member, Bim (9), or up-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family members (10, 11) are also correlated with treatment failure
in the clinic. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways that
determine glucocorticoid sensitivity, multiple resistance mechanisms clearly exist. Additional characterization of the signaling
phase of dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in model systems is
continuing to identify other potential sources of resistance
(reviewed in refs. 2, 3).
Previous work in our laboratory using the WEHI7.2 murine
thymic lymphoma cell model has shown that WEHI7.2 cells
resistant to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via catalase transfection or
selection for resistance to H2O2 are cross-resistant to dexamethasone (12, 13). The oxidative stress-resistant cells show a delay
or lack of cytochrome c release in response to dexamethasone
treatment proportional to their expression of catalase, an enzyme
that metabolizes H2O2 (12, 13). This suggests that H2O2 is a key
signal in dexamethasone-induced apoptosis.
Based on these results, we hypothesized that increasing the
intracellular production of H2O2 is a potential strategy for
sensitizing the cells to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. For
this purpose, we chose to overexpress manganese superoxide
dismutase (MnSOD). MnSOD is a mitochondrial enzyme that
dismutes superoxide (O2 ) forming H2O2 in the process (14). In
other cell types, increasing MnSOD elevated intracellular H2O2
(14, 15). There is evidence from IM-9 multiple myeloma cells that
increasing MnSOD increases dexamethasone sensitivity (16);
however, gene dose of MnSOD in thymocytes did not alter
dexamethasone sensitivity (17). In the current study, we tested
the hypothesis that increasing MnSOD could sensitize WEHI7.2
cells to dexamethasone. By testing this hypothesis in a lymphoma
cell line, we can determine whether manipulating MnSOD to
increase glucocorticoid sensitivity could be a unique characteristic of lymphoid tumor cells that can be exploited for
chemotherapy. We further tested the extent to which we could
replicate the MnSOD effects by pretreating the cells with a
manganoporphyrin, Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2yl)porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP5+).

MnSOD and MnTE-2-PyP5+ Potentiate Apoptosis

Materials and Methods

Reagents and drug treatments. MnTE-2-PyP was provided by Aeolus
Pharmaceuticals. All other chemicals and drugs were purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co., unless otherwise stated.
For the tissue culture cells, sensitivity to dexamethasone was determined
by incubating cells in a final concentration of 1 Amol/L dexamethasone in
an ethanol vehicle ( final concentration of ethanol, 0.01%) or vehicle alone.
For MnTE-2-PyP5+ effects on drug or oxidant response, the cells were
pretreated with the indicated concentrations of MnTE-2-PyP5+ 2 h before
the addition of drugs or oxidants. For measurements of MnTE-2-PyP5+
effects on apoptosis and growth, the cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of MnTE-2-PyP5+ for 24 and 48 h, respectively.
Cell culture and transfections. The mouse thymic lymphoma WEHI7.2
parental cell line (18) was maintained as previously described (13). Stable
WEHI7.2 clones overexpressing MnSOD were constructed by electroporation (13) with a pcDNA3.1 vector containing the human cDNA MnSOD
sequence, a gift from Dr. Larry Oberley (University of Iowa; ref. 19); clones
were isolated and maintained as previously described (13).
H9c2 cells, obtained from Dr. Qin Chen (University of Arizona), are an
immortalized clonal cell line derived from BD1X rat embryonic heart tissue
(20). They do not beat in culture but retain certain electrophysiologic and
biochemical properties of cardiac cells and can form myotubes upon
confluency (20, 21). H9c2 cells were chosen for this study due to their
frequent use as a doxorubicin cardiotoxicity model (e.g., ref. 22). H9c2cells
were maintained in DMEM-high glucose (Invitrogen), supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products) and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine (Invitrogen), at 37jC in a 5% CO2 humidified environment
until 60% to 85% confluence.
Primary follicular lymphoma cells. Two primary human tumor
samples with the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (FL) were obtained
from the Arizona Lymphoid Tissue and Blood Repository in accordance
with University of Arizona regulations for the use of primary human tissue.
The cells were thawed and resuspended in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium (Invitrogen) with 20% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products) in
the presence or absence of MnTE-2-PyP5+ and 750 Amol/L dexamethasone.
Drug concentrations were chosen based on the response in a human
lymphoma-derived cell line. Viable B-cell content was analyzed before the
addition of drugs and after incubation at 37jC in a 5% CO2 humidified
environment for 24 h in the presence or absence of drugs. Cells were labeled
with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD20 to identify B-cells (AbD Serotec) and
7.5 Ag/mL propidium iodide, which stains dead cells, for 20 min. CD20positive/propidium iodide–negative cells were considered viable B cells and
measured by flow cytometry (EPICS XL-MCL, Beckman Coulter, Inc.). An
isotype control was used for each run to gate out CD20-negative cells; debris
was also gated out. At thaw, samples from patient 1 and patient 2 contained
49% and 40% viable B cells, respectively. A minimum of 10,000 events were
analyzed per sample. The percentage of viable B cells in the sample
containing no drugs was set to 100%.
Northern blots and immunoblots. MnSOD-transfected WEHI7.2 clones
were screened for increased MnSOD expression by Northern blots using
cDNAs and protocols described previously (12, 23). Bands were quantitated
using a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) and the accompanying
software. MnSOD expression was corrected for relative glyceraldehyde 3phosphate expression and reported relative to the average expression in the
Mneo1 and Mneo2 vector-only transfectants.
MnSOD protein was quantitated by immunoblotting using anti-MnSOD,
a gift from Dr. Larry Oberley (24), anti–h-actin (Sigma), and antirabbit
immunoglobulin (GE Healthcare) or antimouse immunoglobulin (Pierce), as
previously described (13). Bands were quantitated using a ScanJet 4C
scanner (Hewlett Packard) and one-dimensional analysis software (Kodak).
Enzyme activities. For catalase, samples were prepared and activity was
measured as previously described (12). For MnSOD, samples were prepared
and activity was measured using the method for total SOD activity as
previously described (12), except that the samples were incubated with
50 mmol/L diethyldithiocarbamate at 30jC for 1 h before dialysis to
inactivate Cu,ZnSOD (25). Cellular protein was measured using the

www.aacrjournals.org

bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Enzyme activities were normalized to cellular protein.
EC50 measurements. Relative cell number was measured using the Cell
Proliferation kit II (Roche Diagnostics; H2O2 only) or the Nonradioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS; Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The plates were read at 490 nm using a Microplate EL-311
or a Synergy HT plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Fraction control
absorbance was calculated as previously described (26). The EC50 was
defined as the concentration at which the absorbance was 50% of the
control.
Viable cell number and apoptosis measurements. Viable cell number
was determined by dye exclusion as previously described (13). For the
MnSOD-transfected clones, apoptosis was confirmed by morphologic
examination using previously described criteria (13). The fraction of
apoptotic cells, as measured by Annexin V staining, was determined using
the apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems, Inc.) as previously described (27).
Caspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay that depends
on the cleavage of the synthetic caspase-3–specific substrate, Ac-DEVD-pnitroanilide (pNA; BIMOL International LTD.). Briefly, cells were lysed in
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.01%
Triton X-100 by sonication. The samples were clarified by centrifugation at
10,000  g for 10 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was first incubated in
10 mmol/L PIPES (pH 7.4), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.01% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate hydrate, 5 mmol/L DTT,
200 Amol/L Ac-DEVD-pNA for 2 h, and then the absorbance at 405 nm
measured using a SynergyHT plate reader (Bio Tek Instruments, Inc.).
Activity was normalized for cellular protein measured as described above.
Statistics. Means were compared using ANOVA or Student’s t tests,
where appropriate, with the algorithms in Excel (Microsoft Corp.). Means
were considered significantly different when P V 0.05.

Results
Construction and characterization of the MnSOD-transfected
clones. To determine the effect of MnSOD on dexamethasoneinduced lymphoid cell apoptosis, we first established WEHI7.2
cell clones with increased MnSOD by transfection. As shown in
Fig. 1A, we established several WEHI7.2 cell clones that have
increased MnSOD expression at the mRNA level. Two vector-only
transfectants (Mneo1 and Mneo2) and three MnSOD-transfected
clones (MnSOD5, MnSOD9, and MnSOD20) were selected for the
current study. The MnSOD-transfected clones had significantly
greater MnSOD protein levels than either of the two vector-only
transfected clones (Fig. 1B). The MnSOD transfectants expressed
2.5-fold to 3-fold of the Mneo1 MnSOD protein and were not
significantly different from each other. MnSOD protein in the
Mneo2 vector-only transfected clone was also significantly higher
than that in Mneo1 but still significantly lower than in the MnSODtransfected clones. MnSOD activity increased with elevated MnSOD
protein; the magnitude of the increase in activity was slightly less
than that for the protein (Fig. 1C).
The enzymatic function of MnSOD is to metabolize O2 ,
forming H2O2 in the process (14). Cells that overexpress MnSOD
may increase their ability to metabolize H2O2, because elevated
MnSOD can increase the cellular H2O2 load (14, 28). Our previous
studies indicate that resistance to H2O2 causes cross-resistance to
dexamethasone (12, 13). Therefore, to interpret the phenotype of
the MnSOD-transfected clones, it was critical to understand their
ability to metabolize H2O2. To assess the ability of the clones
to metabolize H2O2, we measured catalase activity and the EC50
for H2O2. Catalase is the primary enzyme in WEHI7.2 cells
that metabolizes H2O2. The EC50 for H2O2 was used to indicate
the overall H2O2 sensitivity of the clones. Catalase activity in the
MnSOD-transfected clones, vector-only transfectants, and the

parental (WEHI7.2) cells was similar (Table 1), suggesting that the
MnSOD-transfected clones had not up-regulated catalase. The EC50
for H2O2 was either slightly (MnSOD5) or significantly (MnSOD9
and MnSOD20) lower than that in the WEHI7.2 and vectortransfected (Mneo1) cells (Table 1). Thus, the H2O2 sensitivity of
the MnSOD-transfected clones was greater than or equal to that in
the WEHI7.2 cells. These data indicate that the MnSOD-transfected
clones had not adapted to increased H2O2 production by upregulating components that would confer H2O2 resistance. These
data are also consistent with elevated MnSOD increasing
intracellular H2O2.
Increased MnSOD confers sensitivity to dexamethasoneinduced apoptosis in WEHI7.2 cells. We hypothesized that
increased MnSOD expression could sensitize WEHI7.2 cells to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

dexamethasone because of the ability of MnSOD to produce H2O2.
Our hypothesis was based largely on our previous work, showing
that WEHI7.2 cells with increased catalase or selected for
resistance to H2O2 are resistant to dexamethasone (12, 13). Recent
data showing that increased MnSOD levels sensitize myeloma cells
to dexamethasone (16) also suggested that lymphoma cells might
have a similar response.
To test our hypothesis, we measured apoptosis in the MnSOD
and vector-only transfectants in three ways. As shown in Fig. 2A,
when we treated the MnSOD-transfected cells with dexamethasone, we saw a faster loss of cells from the culture than in the
vector-only transfected cells. After 24 hours in dexamethasone,
MnSOD5 and MnSOD9 cell cultures had significantly fewer viable
cells than the Mneo1 cell cultures. By 32 hours after dexamethasone treatment, all three MnSOD transfectants had fewer viable
cells than the control transfectants (P V 0.05). The vector-only
transfectants showed kinetics of cell loss similar to that previously
reported for the WEHI7.2 cells (12).
Annexin V binding measurements showed that the MnSODtransfected clone cultures had a greater amount of apoptosis
16 hours after dexamethasone treatment than the vector-only
transfectants (Fig. 2B). Increased apoptosis due to dexamethasone
in the MnSOD-transfected clones was also confirmed by morphologic examination of culture aliquots (data not shown). These data
suggest that increased MnSOD expression is accelerating dexamethasone-induced apoptosis.
MnTE-2-PyP5+ decreases growth in WEHI7.2 cells. Our next
step was to determine whether we could mimic the effects of
MnSOD overexpression with a pharmacologic agent. For these
studies, we used the manganoporphyrin, MnTE-2-PyP5+. We chose
MnTE-2-PyP5+ because, in a cell-free assay, it dismutes O2 with a
mechanism and thermodynamics similar to that of MnSOD and
has a low affinity for H2O2 (29–31).
To provide an overview of the effects of MnTE-2-PyP5+ alone and
in combination with dexamethasone, we measured the number of
WEHI7.2 cells in culture in the presence or absence of drugs by dye
exclusion (Fig. 3A). In the cultures treated with either concentration of MnTE-2-PyP5+ and vehicle, we saw lower cell numbers than
in the WEHI7.2 cells treated with vehicle alone. WEHI7.2 cells
treated with dexamethasone showed an initial increase in cell
number followed by a loss of cells from the culture. In cultures of
WEHI7.2 cells treated with the combination of dexamethasone and
MnTE-2-PyP5+, cell numbers were slightly lower at 16 hours than in
the WEHI7.2 plus dexamethasone cultures. The rate of cell loss in
the cultures from 16 to 32 hours was significantly faster in the
dexamethasone plus 1.5 Amol/L MnTE-2-PyP5+ compared with
dexamethasone-only cultures (2.5 F 0.2  104 versus 1.9 F 0.3 
104 cell/hours, respectively; P V 0.05). We confirmed the cell number data at the 24-hour time point using the MTS assay, which
measures the number of metabolizing cells. Using WEHI7.2 cells
treated with vehicle alone as the control MTS absorbance set at
100 F 0.6%, cultures treated with vehicle plus 0.75 or 1.5 Amol/L
MnTE-2-PyP5+ had significantly lower absorbances, 81.2 F 3.0 or
64.3 F 7.4%, respectively. WEHI7.2 cells treated with dexamethasone
alone had 22.8 F 1.4% control absorbance compared with 5.5 F 1.4%
or 2.7 F 0.8% control absorbance for cells treated with dexamethasone plus 0.75 or 1.5 Amol/L MnTE-2-PyP5+, respectively.
The lower cell numbers in cultures treated with MnTE-2-PyP5+
and vehicle alone (Fig. 3A) suggest that MnTE-2-PyP5+ alone has an
effect on the WEHI7.2 cells. One possibility is that MnTE-2-PyP5+
itself causes apoptosis. To determine whether MnTE-2-PyP5+

MnSOD and MnTE-2-PyP5+ Potentiate Apoptosis

causes apoptosis directly, we measured the percentage of Annexin
V-positive cells in culture after a 24-hour MnTE-2-PyP5+ treatment.
As shown in Fig. 3B, MnTE-2-PyP5+ alone did not increase
apoptosis. Furthermore, we did not see an increase in propidium
iodide–positive cells in the cultures (data not shown); an increase
in propidium iodide–positive cells would be consistent with an
increase in another type of cell death, such as necrosis. A second
possibility is that MnTE-2-PyP5+ decreases proliferation in WEHI7.2
cells, as seen in other cell types (32, 33). When we compared
growth in the presence of MnTE-2-PyP5+, we found that MnTE-2PyP5+ inhibited growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).
MnTE-2-PyP5+ treatment sensitizes WEHI7.2 cells to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. The ability of MnTE-2-PyP5+ to
inhibit growth likely contributes to the decreased cell numbers
seen in the cultures treated with dexamethasone and manganoporphyrin combined compared with dexamethasone treatment
alone. However, if this is the sole explanation, the absorbances we
would predict in the MTS assay for dexamethasone plus 0.75 or 1.5
Amol/L MnTE-2-PyP5+ would be 18.5% and 14.6%, respectively. One

www.aacrjournals.org

possible explanation of the lower-than-predicted values is that the
drug combination causes increased apoptosis compared with
dexamethasone alone. In WEHI7.2 cells, treatment with 1 Amol/L
dexamethasone saturates the glucocorticoid receptors and causes
apoptosis with reproducible kinetics (13). In these cultures, we see
increases in Annexin V–positive cells at 16 hours, caspase-3
activation, and release of cytochrome c at 24 hours, followed by
loss of viable cells from the culture beginning at 24 hours after the
addition of dexamethasone (13, 27).
To determine whether MnTE-2-PyP5+ sensitizes cells to
dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, we tested for the appearance
of increased amounts of apoptotic markers at earlier time points.
We measured both the activation of caspase-3 and the
percentage of Annexin V–positive cells. As shown in Fig. 3C,
8 hours after dexamethasone addition, caspase-3 activity was
minimal in the cells treated with dexamethasone alone. The
MnTE-2-PyP5+ pretreated cells had significantly increased caspase-3 activity compared with the dexamethasone-treated cells.
The MnTE-2-PyP5+ pretreated cultures also showed a significant
increase in the percentage of Annexin V–positive cells in the
presence of dexamethasone compared with the cells treated with
dexamethasone alone (Fig. 3C). MnTE-2-PyP5+ pretreatment
increased the Annexin V–positive cells at earlier time points;
however, this was not significant. These measurements are
corrected for the appropriate values in the vehicle-treated cells
and, thus, reflect only the amount due to dexamethasone. Taken
together, the data indicate that pretreatment with MnTE-2-PyP5+
accelerates apoptosis due to dexamethasone in the WEHI7.2 cells;
increased apoptosis likely contributes to the decreased cell
numbers in the cultures treated with MnTE-2-PyP5+ and
dexamethasone combined.
MnTE-2-PyP5+ sensitizes primary FL cells to dexamethasoneinduced death. To determine whether MnTE-2-PyP5+ has a similar
effect in primary tumor cells, we measured the effect of
dexamethasone and MnTE-2-PyP5+ individually and combined on
B-cell death in primary FL cells from two different patients
(Fig. 3D). As is typical of FL cells, the primary cells did not grow
in culture, so the effect we measured was only on cell death.
Treatment with MnTE-2-PyP5+ alone had no effect in one sample;
however, the higher concentration decreased viable B cells in
patient 2. In both patient samples, dexamethasone alone decreased
the viable B cells. Adding MnTE-2-PyP5+ to dexamethasone
increased B-cell death in both patient samples. These data indicate
that MnTE-2-PyP5+ accelerates dexamethasone-induced cell death

in primary tumor cells and suggests MnTE-2-PyP5+ has clinical
potential for the treatment of lymphoma.
MnTE-2-PyP5+ pretreatment alters the oxidant and chemotherapeutic drug response in WEHI7.2 cells. To better
understand the redox properties of MnTE-2-PyP5+ in the WEHI7.2
cells and interpret the effect of MnTE-2-PyP5+ on the chemotherapeutic drug response, we measured the effect of MnTE-2-PyP5+
pretreatment on the response to H2O2 and paraquat. In cell-free
assays, MnTE-2-PyP5+ has a low level of catalase activity (31). To
determine whether MnTE-2-PyP5+ is contributing to H2O2 removal
in the WEHI7.2 cells, we measured the effect of MnTE-2-PyP5+
pretreatment on the EC50 for H2O2. As shown in Table 2A,
pretreatment at the lower MnTE-2-PyP5+ dose did not alter H2O2
sensitivity; however, at the higher dose, the cells were more
sensitive to H2O2. This indicates that MnTE-2-PyP5+ is not acting as
a catalase mimetic. It is more consistent with MnTE-2-PyP5+ acting

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

as an oxidant under these conditions to sensitize WEHI7.2 cells to
H2O2.
Paraquat is a compound that redox cycles with a variety of
oxidoreductases in cells to produce O2 (34, 35). Paraquat toxicity
has been linked to its ability to produce superoxide because both
increased SOD and treatment with superoxide dismutase mimetics
reduce toxicity (36, 37). In WEHI7.2 cells, MnTE-2-PyP5+ pretreatment increased the EC50 for paraquat in a dose-dependent manner,
indicating that MnTE-2-PyP5+ protected the WEHI7.2 cells from
paraquat toxicity.
The data above suggest that MnTE-2-PyP5+ is a candidate
chemotherapeutic agent in lymphoma treatment because it
sensitizes the lymphoid cells to dexamethasone. To determine
whether MnTE-2-PyP5+ would increase resistance to other
commonly used lymphoma drugs, we tested MnTE-2-PyP5+ in
combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine.

These three drugs plus prednisone, a glucocorticoid, comprise the
CHOP regimen, a standard protocol for treating diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL; ref. 38). These drugs are also used to treat
other types of lymphoma (39). Testing MnTE-2-PyP5+ in combination with doxorubicin is particularly crucial because (a) doxorubicin can redox cycle, similar to paraquat, to produce O2 (40–42)
and (b) doxorubicin is a critical drug in lymphoma chemotherapy
(43). As shown in Table 2B, MnTE-2-PyP5+ pretreatment increased
the sensitivity of the cells to cyclophosphamide but had no effect
on doxorubicin or vincristine sensitivity.
MnTE-2-PyP5+ pretreatment protects H9c2 cardiomyocytes
from doxorubicin-induced toxicity. The clinical use of doxorubicin in lymphoma therapeutics is often limited by acute and
chronic cardiotoxicity (44). A number of studies suggest that
reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by doxorubicin treatment
play a key role in cardiotoxicity in cardiomyocyte cell culture and
mouse models (e.g., refs. 41, 42, 45, among others). Both increased
MnSOD expression and treatment with other MnSOD mimetics are
protective (41, 45). Given the redox properties of MnTE-2-PyP5+,
we tested whether the EC50 for doxorubicin was altered by MnTE2-PyP5+ pretreatment in H9c2 rat heart myocardiocytes. As shown
in Fig. 4, pretreatment with MnTE-2-PyP5+ protected H9c2 cells
from doxorubicin-induced toxicity in a dose-dependent manner.

is similar to the sensitization of multiple myeloma cells to
dexamethasone when MnSOD is increased by transfection or
treatment with demethylating agents (16). However, in thymocytes,
the gene dose of MnSOD (and resulting alterations in activity) did
not track with dexamethasone sensitivity (17). This suggests the
possibility that lymphoid tumor cells may respond differently from
thymocytes in this regard, an attribute that could be exploited
therapeutically. In DLBCL patient tumors, we found that decreased
MnSOD expression correlates with a poorer outcome (46). The loss
of MnSOD may contribute to chemoresistance in these patients
because standard therapy for DLBCL includes the glucocorticoid
prednisone.
The ability of increased MnSOD protein to sensitize WEHI7.2
cells to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis fits a model whereby

Discussion
These data suggest that increasing MnSOD or treating with a
pharmacologic agent that mimics MnSOD effects has the potential
to improve outcome in hematologic malignancies that are treated
with glucocorticoids. In addition to accelerating dexamethasoneinduced apoptosis in the WEHI7.2 and primary FL cells, MnTE-2PyP5+ potentiated cyclophosphamide toxicity while inhibiting
lymphoma cell growth and attenuating doxorubicin toxicity in
H9c2 cardiomyocytes. This combination of responses suggests that
MnTE-2-PyP5+ could benefit lymphoma patients who receive
combined therapy, which includes glucocorticoids, doxorubicin,
and cyclophosphamide.

elevated MnSOD sensitizes the cells to glucocorticoids by increasing
H2O2. This is supported by our observation that increased MnSOD
sensitizes the cells to both H2O2 and dexamethasone. We also see
a slight increase in ROS in the MnSOD-transfected cells (data not
shown). MnSOD overexpression does increase H2O2 tone in other
cell types (14, 28). In our model system, resistance to H2O2 results in
resistance to glucocorticoids (12, 13); thus, a sensitivity to H2O2 is
expected to track with glucocorticoid sensitivity.
Although MnTE-2-PyP5+ treatment and increased MnSOD
protein achieve similar end points, the chemical properties of
MnTE-2-PyP5+ make it unlikely that the observed effects are solely
due to the manganoporphyrin mimicking MnSOD enzymatic
activity. In a cell-free assay, MnTE-2-PyP5+ has SOD activity that
depends on the oxidation and reduction of the manganese in the
center of the porphyrin ring (29). Due to the midpoint redox
potential for this compound, the oxidation reaction and the
reduction reaction are approximately equally likely to occur, i.e.,
similar thermodynamics to MnSOD (30). Unlike MnSOD, however,
where the redox active manganese is surrounded by protein, the
manganese in MnTE-2-PyP5+ is more exposed so that it is accessible
to other cellular components (47). MnTE-2-PyP5+ will redox cycle
with flavin oxidoreductases, i.e., complex I in the mitochondria and
the cytochrome P450 complex, and use the reducing power of small
molecule reductants, such as ascorbate, glutathione, and tetrahydrobiopterin (47–49). Thus, in a cell under oxidizing conditions,
MnTE-2-PyP5+ can act as an oxidant, directly oxidizing proteins,
such as nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; ref. 50) or contributing to
oxidative stress by depleting small molecule reductants.
MnTE-2-PyP5+ may potentiate dexamethasone-induced apoptosis
in WEHI7.2 cells via several mechanisms. Dexamethasone treatment
increases ROS and causes a more oxidized redox environment (51).3
MnTE-2-PyP5+ may act, in part, as an MnSOD mimetic further
increasing intracellular H2O2 and accelerating apoptosis. In a more
oxidized milieu, MnTE-2-PyP5+ can also be redox cycling and causing
further oxidative stress. The H2O2 EC50 values in the presence of
MnTE-2-PyP5+ indicate that MnTE-2-PyP5+ is not detoxifying H2O2;
in the cultures with the higher MnTE-2-PyP5+ concentration, the
cells are more sensitive to H2O2. This supports the hypothesis that,
in an oxidized environment, MnTE-2-PyP5+ can enhance cell death
in the WEHI7.2 cells. MnTE-2-PyP5+ may also be oxidizing
NF-nB. Oxidizing NF-nB inactivates it by inhibiting its binding to
DNA (50). Dexamethasone treatment alone inhibits NF-nB activity in
lymphoid cells, in part by inhibiting NF-nB binding to DNA (52).
Loss of NF-nB survival signals likely contributes to glucocorticoidinduced lymphocyte apoptosis (52). MnTE-2-PyP5+ may potentiate
dexamethasone-induced apoptosis by accelerating NF-nB inhibition.
Additional mechanisms are likely because of the complex signaling
required for dexamethasone-induced apoptosis.
Inhibition of proliferation and potentiation of cyclophosphamide
toxicity are two additional characteristics of MnTE-2-PyP5+ that
would contribute to chemotherapeutic efficacy. In a mouse skin
carcinogenesis model, MnTE-2-PyP5+ inhibits proliferation via
inhibition of activator protein-1 (AP-1) (33). Inhibition of
AP-1 or NF-nB (50) could certainly contribute to the antiproliferative effects of MnTE-2-PyP5+ in WEHI7.2 cells; however, the actual
source of proliferation inhibition is unknown. Cyclophosphamide
normally is bioactivated through hydroxylation by the cytochrome
P450 system in the liver (53). The hydroxylated cyclophosphamide

3

released by the liver is thought to be responsible for the cytotoxic
effects of cyclophosphamide. In a cell-free system, MnTE-2-PyP5+
acts as a cytochrome P450 reductase mimetic and hydroxylates
cyclophosphamide (53). The potentiation of cyclophosphamide
toxicity is consistent with MnTE-2-PyP5+ acting as a cytochrome
P450 reductase mimetic in the WEHI7.2 cells.
The ability of MnTE-2-PyP5+ to protect cardiomyocytes from
doxorubicin toxicity could provide an added chemotherapeutic
benefit because cardiotoxicity is a significant problem in the clinical
use of doxorubicin (44). The effect of MnTE-2-PyP5+ on doxorubicin
toxicity is cell-type specific; MnTE-2-PyP5+ is protective in the H9c2
cardiomyocytes but not in the WEHI7.2 cells. However, MnTE-2PyP5+ protects WEHI7.2 cells from paraquat. Both paraquat and
doxorubicin redox cycle with similar enzymes to produce O2 (34,
35, 42). This suggests that doxorubicin produces ROS in both cell
types, but ROS are only involved in cardiomyocyte toxicity (40, 41,
45). There are at least two scenarios by which MnTE-2-PyP5+
pretreatment can produce these results: (a) MnTE-2-PyP5+ could be
scavenging the O2 produced by paraquat in the WEHI7.2 cells and
doxorubicin in the H9c2 cells or (b) because MnTE-2-PyP5+ redox
cycles using the same enzymes as paraquat and doxorubicin,
MnTE-2-PyP5+ may be competing with both compounds for
reducing equivalents (47). By decreasing the redox cycling of
paraquat and doxorubicin, MnTE-2-PyP5+ can prevent O2 generation. Inactivation of NF-nB by MnTE-2-PyP5+ could also play a role
in cardiomyocyte protection because activation of NF-nB during
doxorubicin treatment is proapoptotic in cardiomyocytes (54).
The profile of MnTE-2-PyP5+ effects: (a) sensitizing lymphoid cells
to dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, (b) not affecting the
doxorubicin toxicity in the WEHI7.2 cells while (c) protecting
cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin and (d) inhibiting proliferation
suggests that MnTE-2-PyP5+ could be effective in DLBCL combined
with CHOP. MnTE-2-PyP5+ also has potential for use in other
hematologic malignancies that use glucocorticoids, especially multiple
myeloma where there is decreased MnSOD and dexamethasone is
standard treatment (16). These data further suggest that MnTE-2-PyP5+
could be investigated as a cardioprotectant for cancers treated with
doxorubicin. The known chemistry of MnTE-2-PyP5+ suggests potential
mechanisms by which some of the observed effects could occur.
However, additional work is necessary to determine the molecular
requirements for the MnTE-2-PyP5+ effect. In lymphoma, the
heterogeneity of treatment response is a significant barrier to successful
treatment. By further characterizing the mechanism of MnTE-2-PyP5+
action, it will be possible to identify the molecular profile of patients
likely to benefit from treatment with MnTE-2-PyP5+.
