BACKGROUND. Oral mucositis (OM) is a frequent complication of mucotoxic cancer therapy, causing significant oral pain, increased infection risk, and impaired
functioning. The efficacy and safety of Saforis (glutamine) powder in UpTec for
oral suspension was evaluated for the prevention and treatment of OM.

METHODS. Three hundred twenty-six patients developing World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2 OM during a chemotherapy screening cycle were randomized to Saforis (n ¼ 163) or placebo (n ¼ 163) 3 times/day during their next
chemotherapy cycle (Treatment Cycle 1). Patients were crossed over to the alternate treatment during Treatment Cycle 2. As prespecified in the statistical plan,
because of a carryover effect in Treatment Cycle 2 the primary efficacy analysis
was based on Treatment Cycle 1 only.

RESULTS. Compared with placebo, Saforis significantly reduced the incidence of

O

ral mucositis (OM) is a clinically significant complication of
mucotoxic cancer therapy. The condition affects an estimated 5%
to 40% of patients receiving standard-dose chemotherapy and >75%
of patients receiving either high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell
transplantation or radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.1–3
Clinically significant OM (World Health Organization [WHO] grade
2), which involves both erythema and ulceration of the oral mucosa, can directly affect the clinical status of the patient and results
in increased pain, difficulty in swallowing, nutritional compromise,
and increased risk for infection.2–4 These clinical sequelae increase
the morbidity and mortality associated with cytotoxic therapy and
interfere with patient functioning and health-related quality of life. It

is well documented that OM and its consequences
increase healthcare resource utilization, eg, hospitalization, opioid analgesics for pain control, nutritional
support, and antimicrobial therapy.1–4 More recently, a
symptom cluster has been described linking OM with
fatigue, anorexia, and related symptoms,5,6 perhaps
from a common pathogenesis of cytokine-based neuroimmunologic derangements.5,7 As a result, OM has
emerged as an important dose-limiting toxicity in
patients receiving mucotoxic cancer therapy.2 Unfortunately, there is a limited armamentarium of pharmacologic agents that have been clearly demonstrated to
either prevent the occurrence or reduce the severity
and duration of clinically significant OM in welldesigned controlled clinical trials. In the US, the only
drug approved for clinically significant OM is palifermin (Kepivance; Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA);
however, the label for this agent restricts its use to
patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing
high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell transplantation.8 Given this important unmet need, safe and effective agents that can prevent and/or treat this doselimiting toxicity of common antineoplastic therapies
are needed.
Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid
that has multiple well-defined functions in human
biologic processes. Current evidence for the pathobiology of mucosal injury indicates that reactive oxygen species, generated from both chemotherapy and
radiation therapy, play a critical role in the initiation
of OM. Glutamine, a precursor for glutathione, plays a
pivotal role in regulating the intracellular redox
potential,9,10 and clinical investigations indicate that
glutamine inhibits other mediators of mucosal barrier
injury by reducing the production of proinflammatory
cytokines and cytokine-related apoptosis.11–13 Other
experimental evidence suggests that glutamine may
improve mucosal barrier wound healing by increasing
fibroblasts and collagen synthesis.14 Glutamine is also
critically important to meet demands for tissue repair
during times of high cellular replication. In these times
of increased glutamine demand caused by physiologic
stress (eg, during and after cytotoxic chemotherapy),
the requirements for glutamine may exceed the body’s
ability to produce sufficient concentrations and exogenous glutamine may be needed. Patients with advanced malignancies and those undergoing cytotoxic
therapy have been reported to have a relative deficiency of glutamine.15,16 However, previous clinical
trials using traditional oral and parenteral glutamine
formulations have been inconsistent and have failed to
reduce the incidence and severity of OM in patients
receiving a wide variety of mucotoxic therapies.17–24
One possible explanation for these results may be

323

insufficient delivery of glutamine to the damaged tissues of the oral mucosa, as glutamine has moderate
solubility and undergoes nonenzymatic degradation
under physiologic conditions.25
Saforis (MGI Pharma, Inc., Bloomington, MN) is
composed of glutamine in a novel, proprietary drugdelivery system (UpTec) that is administered orally.
Compared with other available forms of glutamine,
Saforis has been shown to facilitate the uptake of >100
times more glutamine by epithelial oral mucosal
cells.26 The increase in intracellular glutamine levels
occurs rapidly, within 10 seconds (Fig. 1).26 The ability
of Saforis to prevent OM has been documented in
a well-validated animal model of mucosal injury, and
significant activity was demonstrated compared with
placebo.27 It has also been studied in 4 previously reported clinical studies in various patient populations.28–31
In cancer patients with previous chemotherapy-related
OM, Saforis has been shown to significantly reduce the
duration of OM compared with placebo,29 to reduce
the incidence of moderate to severe OM compared
with placebo,30 and to significantly reduce the severity
of OM compared with the previous chemotherapy
cycle.31
These studies collectively contributed to the design of the present Phase III clinical trial to determine
the efficacy and safety of Saforis compared with placebo for reducing the incidence of WHO grade 2 OM
in patients receiving mucotoxic cancer therapy for
breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Adult patients (18 years of age) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
2 and histopathologically confirmed breast cancer
suitable for treatment with anthracycline-based chemotherapy were eligible to participate. Eligible patients

324

were randomized if they experienced moderate to
severe (WHO grade 2) OM during the screening cycle
of chemotherapy and were also scheduled to receive at
least 2 additional cycles of the same chemotherapy
without a dose reduction. Eligible patients must have
presented with normal oral mucosa (ie, WHO grade 0)
at baseline, have completed any previous radiotherapy
involving the oral or esophageal mucosa at least
6 weeks before study entry, and have recovered from
all previous radiotherapy toxicities. All patients received acyclovir (oral 200 mg twice daily) prophylaxis
during the study.
Patients were excluded if they were receiving or
scheduled to receive any other topical or systemic
treatments specifically targeting OM, including growth
factors, cytokines, cryotherapy, sucralfate, or prostaglandins. Patients could not have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse,
or active mouth or gingival sores. Patients were
excluded if they were pregnant, lactating, or at risk of
pregnancy or if they had participated in a clinical trial
for the treatment or prevention of OM within 4 weeks
of study entry.
All patients provided informed written consent
and this study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP),
International Committee on Harmonisation guidelines, and local ethical and legal requirements. The
protocol, informed consent form, and any amendments to the protocol were reviewed and approved by
the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee at
each participating study site before enrollment of participants into the study. Centers participating in the
trial were monitored by trained field associates according to GCP guidelines. Additionally, all data were
entered using double entry verification and the clinical
database was audited both internally and by an independent third-party auditor to ensure data quality.

Study Design
This study was designed as a multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover Phase III
trial conducted in Russia. Patients who developed WHO
grade 2 OM during the screening cycle of chemotherapy were eligible for randomization to the study drug
(Fig. 2) and received 1 of the following chemotherapy
regimens at standard doses on a 21-day cycle: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF); 5fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC);
or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). The majority of patients were hospitalized during chemotherapy
administration, which is customary in Russia. Eligible
patients were randomized to receive either Saforis or
placebo during their next cycle of chemotherapy

(Treatment Cycle 1). Patients were then crossed over
to receive the other treatment during the subsequent
cycle of chemotherapy (Treatment Cycle 2). Patients
were stratified by chemotherapy regimen before randomization in a 1:1 ratio. A matched placebo was used
to maintain blinding.
The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of Saforis compared with
placebo when used to reduce the incidence of moderate to severe (WHO grade 2) OM associated with
mucotoxic cancer therapy. Secondary objectives were
to determine the treatment effect of Saforis compared
with placebo on the duration of WHO grade 1, 2,
and 3 OM and the effect of Saforis compared with
placebo on another objective measure of oral mucositis, the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS).
Mean OMAS score was calculated based on the sum
of the mean ulceration score across all sites with
ulceration and the mean erythema score across all
sites with erythema as described by Sonis et al.32 The
worst OMAS ulceration score was defined as the average of the greatest 3 scores across the 9 evaluation
sites.
Other efficacy endpoints included the intensity of
oral pain and difficulty of swallowing as assessed by
patient self-report using visual analog scales.

Study Drug
Saforis was administered at a dose of 2.5 g per 5 mL 3
times per day for a total daily dose of 7.5 g. The placebo
formulation matched the texture and characteristics of

the active drug and the administered dose was 5 mL 3
times per day for a total daily dose of 15 mL. The same
placebo was utilized in previous trials, which demonstrated that this placebo is adequate to protect the
blinding of a placebo-controlled trial and that it has no
detrimental effect on the development or presence of
OM in patients.
Study drug treatment began on the first day of
chemotherapy and continued for 14 days after the last
dose of chemotherapy in patients who did not develop OM or until 5 days after resolution of OM for
patients who experienced OM or to the end of the
treatment cycle. Study drug was orally swished for 30
seconds and then swallowed. Patients were instructed
to refrain from eating or drinking for 30 minutes after
dosing. Patients adhered to good oral hygiene practices and gently brushed their teeth twice daily, 30
minutes or more after each study drug treatment,
using a soft toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Daily
flossing and an alcohol-free fluoride rinse was recommended. No other prophylactic mouthwashes or
treatments for mucositis were allowed.

Study Assessments
Signs and symptoms of OM were assessed by the investigator 3 times per week on nonconsecutive days
during the screening cycle and during Treatment
Cycles 1 and 2 (on Days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14), and
additionally on Days 16 and 18 of each cycle if the
patient developed OM. The WHO OM scale (Table 1)33
and the OMAS were used to assess the severity of OM.
Among patients who developed OM, oral assessment
continued for the first 3 weeks or until mucositis
returned to grade 0. Additionally, patients self-reported
the ability to eat solid foods.
Safety was assessed throughout the study by
physical examination, including inspection of oral tissues, hematology and serum chemistry laboratory
tests, and adverse event reporting. Any adverse event,
whether or not related to the study drug, was reported
with date and time of onset, severity (WHO Toxicity
Criteria), relation with study drug (probably, possibly,
or unlikely), pattern, action taken, and outcome. If
the adverse event had not resolved at the time the

case report forms were collected, a follow-up report
was provided at a later date. If no follow-up report
was provided, the investigator provided a justification.
All adverse events were followed until either they
resolved or the investigator determined that the event
was no longer clinically significant.

Statistical Analyses
For the purpose of sample size determination, it was
assumed that the proportion of cycles with occurrence of WHO grade 2 OM would be 50% in Saforistreated cycles and 70% in placebo-treated cycles.
Given these assumed proportions, the proportion of
discordant pairs could have ranged from 0.2 to 0.8.
Over this range, corresponding to a 0.8 proportion of
discordant pairs, the maximum required sample size
to achieve 90% power was 206 patients. This figure
was increased to 300 to provide a greater number of
patients for the purpose of evaluating safety.
The efficacy data were intended to be analyzed
based on the crossover design using data from both
Treatment Cycles 1 and 2, assuming no statistical evidence of an unequal carryover effect for the primary
endpoint. However, because an unequal statistical
carryover effect was detected, the primary efficacy
analyses were conducted using results from only
Treatment Cycle 1 as prespecified in the statistical
plan.
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusted for center, was used to analyze the proportion
of patients with WHO grade 2 OM, WHO grade 3
OM, OMAS ulceration score >0, and ability to eat
solid foods. An analysis of variance model with terms
for treatment and center was used to analyze the
mean OMAS score and worst OMAS ulceration score.
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess a shift
in the distribution of WHO grade of OM and to compare treatment groups with respect to patient symptom scores. Duration of OM was analyzed using a logrank test, and patients without OM were considered
to have durations of zero. Additional analyses, using
descriptive statistics, were performed on the subset of
patients who experienced, at a minimum, the degree
of OM being analyzed.

RESULTS
Patients
Of 2,084 patients who were screened, 326 (15.6%) patients developed WHO grade 2 OM during the
screening cycle consented and were randomized to either Saforis (n ¼ 163) or placebo (n ¼ 163) in Treatment Cycle 1. Baseline demographics and disease
characteristics for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population
are shown in Table 2. All patients were female and
Caucasian; median age was 50 years (range, 24–74
years). All but 1 patient had histologically confirmed
adenocarcinoma of the breast (99.7%); the remaining 1
patient was diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive
breast tumor (0.3%). The randomization groups were
balanced for all baseline characteristics, including
mean and median WHO grade of OM during screening
chemotherapy. The majority of patients in the randomized portion of the study received CAF chemotherapy (61%) and treatment groups were balanced for
chemotherapy regimen. No patients received low-level
laser therapy or oral or esophageal radiation before
enrollment. All subjects received prechemotherapy
baseline oral examinations but no stabilizing dental
treatments. No subjects were enrolled in the study if
there was clinical evidence of active oral mucosal disease at baseline.
Greater than 90% of patients completed the study,
with little difference in the rate of discontinuation
during treatment with Saforis or placebo. During
Treatment Cycle 1, 8 (5%) patients discontinued treatment with Saforis, and 13 (8%) patients discontinued
treatment with placebo. The majority of patients were

compliant with the dosing regimen. Among patients
who missed 1 dose of Saforis (n ¼ 71) or placebo
(n ¼ 69) during Treatment Cycle 1, the mean number
of missed doses were 2.9 and 4.0, respectively. Among
patients who missed 1 dose of Saforis (n ¼ 58) or
placebo (n ¼ 59) during Treatment Cycle 2, the mean
number of missed doses were 3.2 and 2.8, respectively. The majority of patients in the Saforis/placebo
sequence (95%) and in the placebo/Saforis sequence
(90%) received 1 concomitant medication during
Treatment Cycle 1. There were no statistically significant differences between sequence groups with regard to number of patients using >1 concomitant
medication or number of patients using a specific
medication. Nearly all patients were receiving at least 1
concomitant medication during Treatment Cycle 1,
most commonly ondansetron, metoclopramide, ascorbic acid, and prednisolone.

Incidence and Severity of Oral Mucositis (ITT Analysis:
Treatment Cycle 1)
During Treatment Cycle 1 the incidence of WHO grade
2 OM was significantly reduced for patients treated
with Saforis compared with patients treated with placebo (38.7% vs 49.7%; P ¼ .026; Fig. 3). Analysis of the
severity of OM in Treatment Cycle 1 showed a statistically significant (P ¼ .042) shift in the distribution of
maximum grade toward lower grade in the Saforis arm
(Table 3). Although overall incidence of WHO grade 3
OM was low, the incidence was significantly lower in
the Saforis arm compared with the placebo arm. Only

11 (6.7%) patients in the placebo arm developed WHO
grade 3 OM during Treatment Cycle 1 (P ¼ .005;

was also associated with a statistically significant
decrease in worst ulceration score in Treatment Cycle 1
compared with patients receiving placebo (P ¼ .013;
Table 4). The proportion of patients with OMAS ulceration score >0 was significantly lower in the Saforis
group than in the placebo group (P ¼ .025). Analysis of
the incidence of WHO grade 2 OM at each assessment time point throughout Treatment Cycle 1 is
shown in Figure 4. Saforis consistently reduced the
proportion of patients with WHO grade 2 OM.

with the placebo group (97.5% vs 91.9%; P ¼ .039). No
treatment differences were observed with respect to
intensity of oral pain or swallowing difficulty.

Carryover Effect: Treatment Cycle 2
Clinical trials using a crossover design assume that the
effects of the drug used in the first cycle will not affect
the outcome of the second cycle or that the 2 carryover
effects will be equal.34 Because the test of the hypothesis of equal carryover effects for the 2 treatment
sequence groups (Saforis followed by placebo and placebo followed by Saforis) detected a statistically significant difference in carryover effects (P ¼ .0269 for the
ITT population), the assumption of equal carryover
effects was rejected and supported the prespecified
plan to analyze the trial as a single-treatment-cycle,
parallel-group-design study.
The incidence of WHO grade 2 OM in patients
receiving Saforis for the first time was consistent
between Treatment Cycles 1 and 2 (38.7% Cycle 1 and
40.5% for Cycle 2); however, the incidence of WHO
grade 2 OM among placebo-treated patients was

significantly lower in Cycle 2 (31.9%) compared with
Cycle 1 (49.7%; P ¼ .0269, Fig. 3). Patients who were
treated with placebo in Treatment Cycle 2 were
exposed to Saforis for approximately 19 days in their
prior Treatment Cycle 1 and then received chemotherapy on average approximately 2 days later. Therefore, the apparent effectiveness of placebo in the
second cycle is more suggestive of a carryover effect.

Safety
Adverse events were analyzed for Treatment Cycles 1
and 2. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events included nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, weakness, asthenia, alopecia, fatigue, neutropenia,
dry mouth, and anorexia (Table 5), all of which typically occur in cancer patients receiving cytotoxic
chemotherapy. The majority of these events were mild
to moderate in severity and considered unrelated to
study drug. Treatment-emergent adverse events that
were considered possibly or probably related to study
drug (primarily nausea) were reported by 10.5% of
patients during a Saforis cycle and 11.1% of patients
during a placebo cycle. Five patients (1.6%) experienced serious adverse events while receiving placebo;
no patient experienced a serious adverse event while
receiving Saforis. Overall, the safety profile of Saforis
was comparable to that of placebo.

DISCUSSION
This trial demonstrated that Saforis reduced the incidence of clinically significant OM and reduced the se-

verity of OM compared with placebo in patients
receiving mucotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment
of breast cancer. Moreover, the efficacy of Saforis was
consistently observed across multiple endpoints.
Historically, management of OM in cancer patients has been limited to supportive care—including
pain control, nutritional support, hydration, and wound
care—and to simple, nonspecific interventions such as
cryotherapy and compounded mouthwashes that include a topical local anesthetic agent. Although these
interventions may be beneficial, they are not directed to
the fundamental mechanistic changes associated with
the pathophysiology of OM, nor do they prevent OM.
The current paradigm for mucosal injury in cancer patients is based on a complex cascade of mucosal tissue
changes that appears to be initiated within hours of
exposure to cytotoxic agents (Fig. 5).2,23,35 This model
provides an important framework for conceptualizing
and testing possible interventions directed at various
targets or points along the mucosal injury cascade.
Glutamine has for many years been viewed as a potentially valuable agent for reducing mucosal injury in
cancer patients.15,22 Given the role of reactive oxygen
species and cytokines in the mucosal injury cascade, it
is logical to hypothesize that glutamine may provide
therapeutic benefit in cancer patients at risk for OM.
However, several studies using simple formulations of
oral glutamine that do not facilitate uptake by mucosal
cells did not demonstrate a definitive benefit.17–23 By
contrast, Saforis facilitates rapid uptake of glutamine
and delivers glutamine directly to mucosal cells at risk
for injury from mucotoxic cancer therapy.
There are several potential mechanisms by which
Saforis may protect epithelial cells from mucotoxic
cancer therapy, including providing them with the fuel
to recover from previous damage and stimulating collagen production. As noted previously, glutamine is a
conditionally essential amino acid that has multiple
functions in the human body. Most important and in
the context of mucosal injury, glutamine is a precursor
for glutathione, which increases intracellular redox
potential9,10; it inhibits proinflammatory cytokines and
cytokine-related apoptosis11–13; and it increases synthesis of collagen by fibroblasts, which is important for
healing (Fig. 5).14,23
In addition, a statistically significant carryover effect
in this study was observed that may reflect a possible
biologic effect of Saforis in patients receiving placebo in
Treatment Cycle 2. This finding is intriguing and suggests that pretreatment with Saforis in Treatment Cycle
1 may have protected patients from OM during the subsequent chemotherapy cycle, perhaps through multiple
wound-healing pathways. Although epithelial lesions
may resolve clinically between courses of anticancer

FIGURE 5. Proposed effects of Saforis in relation to the current model of the mucosal injury process as described by Sonis.23 During initiation, chemotherapy
and radiation damage DNA directly and through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); intracellular glutamine neutralizes ROS via glutathione, thus preventing further damage. During up-regulation and message generation, intracellular signaling molecules such as NF-kB induce expression of genes involved in inflammation and fibronectin breakdown; during this phase, intracellular glutamine decreases NF-kB expression. During signaling and amplification, a variety of
proinflammatory cytokines are produced that cause extended tissue injury; during this phase, intracellular glutamine down-regulates these cytokines, particularly
TNF-a, thus closing the inflammatory feedback loop. In addition, intracellular glutamine reduces apoptosis of epithelial cells throughout these initial phases. During
ulceration, breakdown of the mucosal epithelium results in significant pain; colonization by microorganisms, thus increasing the risk of sepsis; and secretion of
inflammation-mediated proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages in response to bacterial endotoxin. During this phase, intracellular glutamine reduces inflammation, stimulates infiltrating lymphocytes, and provides metabolic energy for new protein synthesis. Finally, during healing, the oral mucosa is reestablished, but
the patient remains at higher risk for oral mucositis. During healing, intracellular glutamine promotes collagen biosynthesis by fibroblasts and provides a source of
nitrogen for rebuilding normal healthy mucosal tissue, resulting in more robust healing and reduced risk of subsequent mucositis. Saf, Saforis; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappaB; IL, interleukin; TNF-a, tumor necrosis factor-alpha.

therapy, the nascent epithelial cells may still be rapidly
dividing and differentiating as part of the normal healing process.2 These rapidly dividing cells are likely
more susceptible to cytotoxic agents, thus increasing
the potential of recurring mucosal damage during the
next course of chemotherapy. Thus, patients on multiple-cycle chemotherapy may be at risk for more severe
OM in subsequent cycles, particularly if they developed severe OM during their previous cycle of chemotherapy. However, not every patient who previously
developed WHO grade 2 OM develops a comparable
degree or severity of OM during their next chemotherapy cycle, as observed in this study. For example, despite the fact that 100% of all patients who were
entered into the treatment phase of this clinical trial
had documented WHO grade 2 OM during the
screening cycle, only 50% of patients in the placebo
arm developed WHO grade 2 OM during Treatment

Cycle 1. This outcome illustrates the variable clinical
expression of OM within patients despite repeated
mucotoxic chemotherapy cycles, as well as across patients receiving the same chemotherapy regimen. Further studies of Saforis in patients receiving multiple
cycles of mucotoxic chemotherapy, without a crossover design, will be important.
Although a statistically significant carryover was
observed in this study, the clinical significance of this
observation is unclear. One hypothesis is that Saforis
may interrupt the cycle of mucosal damage and reduce
the incidence of OM not only in the treatment cycle
when it was administered but also in the next treatment
cycle when patients were no longer receiving active
drug. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that
Saforis facilitates more rapid and complete repair of
mucosal damage, thus rendering the epithelium more
resistant to further oxidative damage. Alternatively,

there may have been insufficient time between the last
dose of Saforis and crossover to placebo to allow a
return to baseline tissue levels of glutamine; indeed,
based on the dosing guidelines, a subset of patients
may have continued treatment with Saforis through
the end of Treatment Cycle 1.
Saforis offers several potential advantages over certain other therapies, including its ease of use and a
favorable safety profile. The oral swish-and-swallow
regimen integrates well with current established foundations of oral care for cancer patients (including oral
hygiene practices) delivers the drug directly to the target
tissue, and may be more convenient than intravenous
therapy. Several studies,29–31 including the present
study, have demonstrated the excellent safety profile of
Saforis, which is comparable to that of placebo. The
total daily dose of Saforis used in the present study was
within the range of dietary glutamine consumed by an
adult on a high-protein diet (approximately 8 g per
day). At this dose, the amount of glutamine ingested
has been shown to present no safety risk; 30 g or more
per day is often administered as a supplement to total
parenteral nutrition without negative effect.
In conclusion, there continues to be a considerable
need for safe, convenient, and cost-effective agents that
can prevent or reduce the severity of OM in cancer
patients at risk. Molecularly targeted therapies are
being developed as expanded knowledge of the pathophysiology of mucosal injury emerges. Saforis is a promising new agent that has demonstrated significant
clinical benefit in patients at risk for OM, and it is a
safe, easily administered oral therapy. Moreover,
Saforis could be complementary if not synergistic with
other agents that are directed at specific molecular targets. Such strategies may result in the substantial reduction of not only the incidence and severity of OM,
but also, possibly, in other symptom complex toxicities
that share common pathophysiologic pathways in
these cancer patients.
