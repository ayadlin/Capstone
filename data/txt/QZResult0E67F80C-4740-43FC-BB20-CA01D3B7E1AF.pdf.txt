Abstract
Strategies to induce p53 for cancer therapy offer appeal but
many tumors harbor inactivating p53 mutations. One way to
address this situation may be to activate the p53-related
protein p73, which functions similarly, but unlike p53, is rarely
lost or mutated in cancer. Along these lines, a recent study
reports that a p53-derived peptide that targets iASPP—a
common negative regulator of p53 family members—can
effectively trigger tumor cell death by a p73-dependent
mechanism. These findings promote further study of iASPP
targeting as a therapeutic strategy to activate p73. [Cancer Res
2008;68(13):4959–62]

Background
The tumor suppressor protein p53 is activated by various
forms of cellular stress, including oncogene activation, DNA
damage, g-irradiation, and numerous chemotherapeutic drugs
(1). Once activated, the levels of p53 accumulate in the nucleus and
transactivate a myriad of target genes. These target genes primarily
bring about either growth arrest, during which cellular damage can
be repaired, or programmed cell death, which serves to eradicate
cells that may otherwise go on to form a tumor (2). In addition to
its central role in preventing cancer development because many
tumor cells are more likely to die after p53 activation than are their
normal counterparts, p53 has also become considered a highly
credible target for therapeutic intervention (1, 2). As a result, in
addition to, as outlined above, the many standard forms of
chemotherapy that activate p53, a number of strategies have been
developed to more directly target p53¶s activation. To date, the best
characterized are a group of compounds termed Nutlins (3). These
compounds disrupt the interaction between p53 and its major
endogenous negative regulator, Mdm2. In unstressed cells, Mdm2
keeps p53 activity at bay by ubiquitilating the protein, thereby
directing its ultimate degradation by the proteosome (4, 5). Nutlins
counter this mechanism and cause elevation of p53 levels. On going
studies continue to show the broad spectrum of tumor types that
respond well to treatment with Nutlins both in vitro and in vivo (3).
Due to the major tumor suppressive role of p53, for successful
tumor development, tumor cells must be able to circumvent the
p53 pathway. This is most exemplified by the fact that over half of
all human tumors contain p53 mutations, which result in defective
p53 proteins that are unable to activate proapoptotic target genes
(1, 2). As a result, therapeutic strategies like Nutlins that are

designed to be dependent on the presence of wild-type p53
are limited in their application. To combat this and due to the fact
that many mutations in p53 result in the production of a full-length
mutant protein, an alternative therapeutic strategy has been
to develop compounds that can ‘‘flip’’ mutant p53 back in to a
wild-type conformation, which induces tumor cell death. The
best described of these include CP-31398 and PRIMA-1, which have
both been shown to significantly reduce tumor size in animal
models (6, 7).
The massive diversity of molecular changes present in each
tumor type, however, mean that there is still nevertheless scope for
the development of strategies that activate cell death irrespective
of p53 status—whether wild-type, mutant, or not present at all. One
very promising candidate target in this regard is the p53-related
protein, p73. p73 is in many ways a functional paralog of p53, being
able to activate many of the same target genes as p53, resulting in
the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (8). Additionally,
p73 is relatively ubiquitously expressed and induced in response to
a wide range of therapeutic agents, such that knockdown of
transactivation competent isoforms of p73 (TA-p73), can significantly reduce levels of chemotherapy-induced cell death (9). p73 is
notably different to p53, however, in that it is rarely lost or mutated
in human cancer. As a result, p73 holds the potential, if successfully
targeted, to cause cell death in multiple tumor cell types. Here, we
describe one report from our own laboratory, which details the
discovery of a p53-derived peptide that induces cell death in vitro
and in vivo by derepression of p73 (10). The function and
mechanism behind the action of this peptide and its relevance in
the growing field of p53 family signaling pathways as targets for
therapeutic intervention are discussed.

Key Findings
Our studies revealed that a 37 amino acid peptide derived from
wild-type p53 was able to stimulate cell death in a variety of cells
lines irrespective of whether or not the lines contain wild-type p53
(10). This peptide, which we termed 37AA, consists of a
noncontiguous fusion of evolutionarily conserved regions II and
III (residues 118–142 and 171–181) from within the DNA-binding
domain of p53. Although from the DNA-binding domain, it
was clear that 37AA could stimulate apoptosis without being able
to directly transactivate p53 target genes. Reporter gene assays
using regulatory elements from four previously described p53
targets (p21, Bax, PUMA, and PIG3) revealed that although
wild-type p53 activated each reporter very effectively, 37AA was
essentially inert (10).
Because 37AA seemed not to be modulating its effects through
direct transactivation, we considered that it may function through
a protein-protein interaction. One group of proteins that bind p53
in the region from which 37AA is derived, is the ASPP family, which
regulate the ability of p53 to bind promoter elements of

Figure 1. Multiple strategies have been devised to activate p53 family members for cancer therapy. These may result in p53 and/or p73 activation when used
alone or, as depicted, in combination to maximally activate either p53, p73, or both for therapeutic gain. 1, currently applied therapies such as chemotherapy and
irradiation can be administered to increase p53 or p73 levels. 2, in tumors with mutant p53, molecules such as PRIMA-1 can be used to reconfigure the mutant
protein into a wild-type confirmation. 3, nutlin compounds can also either be used to elevate p53 and p73 levels, or like the p53-derived apoptotic peptide, 37AA, can be
used to ensure p53 and/or p73 are free of inhibitory influences (Mdm2 in the case of Nutlins and iASPP in the case of 37AA) to activate proapoptotic downstream
signaling.

proapoptotic target genes. The ASPP family consists of two
proapoptotic family members, ASPP1 and ASPP2 (11), both of
which bind to p53 and aid transcription of proapoptotic genes, and
one antiapoptotic family member, iASPP, which represses the
apoptotic transactivation potential of p53 (12). We considered
therefore that 37AA may bind this family of proteins and as a result,
positively regulate the apoptotic function of p53. We knew that
37AA could induce cell death in the absence of p53, so we extended
our hypothesis to include the possibility that if iASPP also binds
p73, then 37AA may, in p53-null cells, act to displace iASPP from
p73, thereby derepressing the ability of p73 to transactivate
proapoptotic target genes (Fig. 1). Our coimmunoprecipitation
studies revealed that this was indeed the case with a strong
iASPP:p73 interaction being almost completely disrupted by the
presence of 37AA (10).
If our biochemical studies on iASPP:p73 complex disruption
were behind the cell death induction by 37AA, the death should be
dependent on the levels and/or activities of iASPP and p73. In line
with this, our subsequent studies showed that death from 37AA
could be repressed by excess iASPP or by the knocking-down
TA-p73 with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA). In addition, death was

also inhibited by overexpression of DNp73 (a naturally occurring
dominant negative p73 isoform). In the absence of 37AA, death was
also induced by knockdown of iASPP by RNAi, indicating that
iASPP targeting is most likely the only way by which 37AA affects
cell viability.
Subsequent experiments in mice where an expression
vector containing 37AA was administered systemically in dendrimer-based nanoparticles revealed that 37AA was able to cause
marked regression of human colorectal cancer xenografts. The
introduction of either an shRNA targeting TA-p73 or overexpression of iASPP dramatically reduced this observed regression,
indicating that the therapeutic effect we observed was mediated
by the mechanism we had elucidated in vitro (10). Importantly,
the nanoparticles used in the study exhibit striking tumor-selective
delivery such that there were no noticeable side effects of
the administration of 37AA in this way. In addition, our in vitro
studies also revealed that nontransformed cells (mouse embryo
fibroblasts, human foreskin fibroblasts, and retinal epithelial cells)
showed no sensitivity to 37AA unless they were transduced
with retroviruses expressing the oncogene, E1a. This therefore
opens up the possibility that even in the absence of nanoparticle

technology, small molecule mimetics of 37AA may be designed to
target p73 and cause selective killing of transformed cells. The
mechanism behind the selective killing of oncogenically transformed cells, however, remains unknown and requires further
investigation.

Implications
p73, and in particular, the transactivating isoforms (TA) of p73,
have recently become compelling targets for drug-based screening
programs aimed at instigating cell death in tumor cells. Because
TA-p73 is rarely mutated in cancer and is able to activate a wide
range of apoptotic genes, there is scope for the design of targetspecific therapies within a broad spectrum of cancers. There have
been a variety of studies that suggest that this may be the case.
First, studies by Irwin and colleagues (9) have shown that TA-p73 is
important for the effectiveness of traditional strategies currently
used in the clinic, i.e., chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Second,
novel screens completed by Wafik El-Diery’s group have isolated
some novel compounds that mediate their proapoptotic responses
through p73 in the absence of p53 (13). Finally and most recently, a
study by Bowman and colleagues (14) has revealed that the abovedescribed Nutlin compounds can effectively alleviate MDM2mediated transcriptional inhibition of TAp73, thus allowing the
transactivation of proapoptotic target genes, NOXA, and PUMA.
The findings in these and our own 37AA study therefore not only
reillustrate the potential for therapeutics to be designed directly
toward TA-p73 but also identify new targets, in our case iASPP, as
potential entry points to achieve this goal.
In some tumors, however, the absence or mutation of p53
would not always lead to p73 being the default option for
targeted therapy. As with most aspects of cancer genetics, the
situation is far more complex than simply targeting and
activating one gene. The p73 gene encodes for proteins involving
a number of different COOH-terminal isoforms, many of which as
yet still do not have completely defined functions (15). In
addition, and more importantly, the two NH2-terminal isoforms,
TA-p73 and DN-p73, seem to exhibit different expression profiles
in different tumor types as well as strikingly different functionalities (15). Many cancers that express high levels of TA-p73 also
exhibit high DN- levels; thus, it is possible that these may not
respond as well to p73-targeted therapies (16). For example, any
free TA-p73 made available after 37AA could be inhibited by high
levels of DN- isoform. It is therefore likely that DN-expression
levels will have to be established to predict the efficacy of such
strategies. In this regard, it should also be noted that the selective
targeting of DN- forms of p73 is also being considered as a
therapeutic option, and if successful, it will be interesting to see if
this approach would act cooperatively with agents designed to
either elevate or derepress TA-forms of p73 to cause tumor cell
death.
Our study on 37AA not only highlights the potential usefulness of
TA-p73 as a target for drug design but also that of the iASPP

protein. High levels of exogenously expressed iASPP correlate with
increased resistance to cisplatin/UV-induced apoptosis (12). In
addition, iASPP has been found to be overexpressed in a variety
of cancers, including breast carcinomas and certain leukemias
(12, 17). It is therefore possible that molecules, such as 37AA or
compounds designed specifically to inhibit iASPP, may be
particularly effective in these tumor types. It is also interesting to
note that although original reports suggest that iASPP can act as a
powerful oncogene that can significantly enhance the transforming
activity of Ras and E1a oncogenes in rat embryo fibroblasts, a
recent study by Laska and colleagues (18) suggests that in normal
cells, iASPP can actually aid the induction of apoptosis via
inhibition of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB). The introduction of iASPP
siRNA was found to reduce apoptosis when nontransformed
lymphocytes, and human lung fibroblasts were exposed to etoposide and other stresses, indicating the consequences of iASPP
targeting may be context specific. In these scenarios, it may be that
37AA-mediated inhibition of iASPP may also have a temporary
protective effect on nontransformed cells when exposed to similar
genotoxic strategies and, thus, may be very useful clinically.
Whether 37AA can interfere with the interaction between iASPP
and the relevant NF-nB subunit, however, still remains to be
elucidated.
Most currently applied anticancer strategies such as chemotherapy and irradiation result in DNA damage, which can cause
elevation of both p53 and p73. Because of this, it is thought that
rationally designed therapeutics, which also serve to modulate the
levels and or activities of p53 family members, such as the Nutlins
or 37AA and its derivatives, could work in conjunction with
standard chemotherapy to produce an additive or even synergistic
effect (Fig. 1). Nutlins and 37AA would act to ensure that activated
p53 and/or p73 are not degraded or inhibited from activating target
genes. In fact, studies have already shown that nutlins can
radiosensitize lung carcinoma cells and chemosensitize neuroblastoma cells (19, 20). Further studies are therefore now required to
see if 37AA or its derivatives can do the same, and ultimately,
whether each of these different strategies can be selectively used in
combination to maximally activate p53 family members for
therapeutic gain (Fig. 1).
