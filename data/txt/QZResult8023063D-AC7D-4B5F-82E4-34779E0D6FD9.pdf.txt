BACKGROUND: Patients with biochemical disease recurrence (BCR) after definitive treatment for prostate cancer comprise a heterogeneous population for whom standard therapy options are lacking. The purpose of the current trial was to evaluate the feasibility,
toxicity, and efficacy of early multimodality systemic therapy in men with BCR. METHODS: Eligible patients had an increasing
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, a PSA doubling time 10 months, and no evidence of metastases after radical prostatectomy
(RP) and/or radiotherapy (RT) for localized disease. Treatment consisted of docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4
cycles, bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 8 cycles, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 18 months. The
primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who were free from PSA progression 1 year after the completion of therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were included in the analysis. At 1 year after the completion of ADT, 45% of patients (13 of 29
patients) and 29% of patients (5 of 17 patients) with a testosterone level 100 ng/dL and 240 ng/dL, respectively, had a PSA <0.2
ng/mL. The median follow-up was 27.5 months (interquartile range, 21.8-38.1 months). Eight patients (20%) were free from PSA progression, 19 patients (46%) did not reinitiate ADT, and 34 patients (83%) were free from metastasis. Sixteen patients (39%) experienced grade 3 and 5 patients (12%) experienced grade 4 toxicities (toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]). CONCLUSIONS: Multimodality systemic therapy with docetaxel, bevacizumab, and ADT is feasible and produces PSA responses in men with BCR. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine the percentage of patients with a durable PSA response who are able to avoid having to reinitiate prostate cancer therapy. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
In 2014, approximately 233,000 men in the United States were diagnosed with prostate cancer.1 Among those undergoing definitive local therapy, 20% to 80%, depending on initial risk factors, will experience a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after local therapy without evidence of metastatic disease, an event that is termed biochemical disease
recurrence (BCR).2
The clinical course of patients with BCR is highly variable given heterogeneous tumor biology. In 1999, Pound et al
were the first to describe the natural history of BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients receiving no androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before the development of metastatic disease.3 In this patient cohort, the median time from
BCR to metastases was 8 years and the median time from metastasis to death was 5 years. In addition, PSA doubling time
(PSADT) and Gleason score were found to be predictive of the development of metastasis.4 These data highlight that
some patients with favorable disease require minimal therapy, whereas those with high-risk disease require more aggressive
treatment options.
The standard treatment for patients with BCR has not been established given the lack of data derived from randomized controlled trials. Although salvage radiotherapy (RT) and, rarely, salvage RP can result in favorable outcomes in a percentage of men, in many cases salvage local therapy is not curative, most likely due to the presence of occult metastatic

disease at the time of BCR.5 Compounding the treatment
decisions in this population is the lack of reliable imaging
to discriminate between local and systemic disease
recurrence.
The most commonly prescribed treatment for men
with BCR is ADT, and its use among these patients has
increased substantially over the past several decades.6
Based on results from the CaPSURE (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor) database, 59%
and 93% of men who received primary RP or RT, respectively, were treated with ADT at the time of BCR.6 Currently, no clear consensus exists for the optimal timing of
ADT. Initiating ADT at the time of early disease recurrence and with low PSA levels is associated with favorable
but usually transient PSA responses; however, the impact
of early versus later initiation of ADT on survival and
quality of life remains uncertain.
Adjuvant chemotherapy has demonstrated clear
benefits in terms of reduced risk of disease recurrence and
improved survival for multiple tumors including breast,
colorectal, and lung cancer.7 Recently, early treatment
with docetaxel and ADT compared with ADT alone for
men with castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer
was shown to significantly improve overall survival (OS)
(52.7 months vs 42.3 months; P 5 0006).8 The magnitude of the survival benefit was the largest documented
among any advanced prostate cancer study, raising the
question of whether earlier treatment with chemotherapy
for men with BCR could also be efficacious. Within the
context of a phase 2 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and
toxicity of 4 cycles of docetaxel and estramustine and 18
months of ADT in 62 men with BCR after local therapy.9
At 1 year after the completion of therapy, 97% of patients
had a testosterone level 100 ng/dL and 36% had an
undetectable PSA. At a median follow-up of 8.6 years,
24% of men had an undetectable or nonprogressive PSA
level and recovered testosterone, thus supporting the hypothesis that a percentage of men with BCR may experience long-term remissions after intense but finite
multimodal systemic therapy.10
Angiogenesis is known to play a central role in tumor growth and metastasis in prostate cancer.11 In preclinical studies, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) inhibition in combination with ADT produced
significant inhibition of tumor growth when compared
with either ADT or VEGF inhibition alone.11 Furthermore, increasing levels of VEGF in patients with metastatic disease correlates with disease progression. Although
bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to
VEGF, has demonstrated efficacy in several tumor types
2604

including colorectal and lung cancer, it failed to improve
survival in randomized trials in patients with metastatic,
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).12 In the
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 90401 trial,
the addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel in patients with
metastatic CRPC improved progression-free survival and
the objective response rate, but did not improve OS.12 At
the time the CALGB 90401 trial was accruing patients,
we designed a neoadjuvant trial and BCR trial (reported
herein) exploring the use of bevacizumab in patients in
the early stages of high-risk prostate cancer. In our neoadjuvant, phase 2, multicenter trial, we evaluated the efficacy
of docetaxel with bevacizumab in 41 men with high-risk
prostate cancer undergoing RP.13 Twelve patients (29%)
achieved a >50% reduction in tumor volume as measured
by magnetic resonance imaging and 9 patients (22%)
achieved a 50% posttreatment decline in PSA, although
no patient achieved a complete pathologic response. The
role of chemotherapy and antiangiogenic approaches
within the context of prostatectomy and RT are actively
being explored in randomized clinical trials.
To the best of our knowledge, the benefit of early
multimodality systemic therapy with docetaxel, antiangiogenic therapy, and ADT in high-risk men with BCR
after local therapy has not been explored to date. In this
phase 2 study, we investigated the efficacy and toxicity of
docetaxel, bevacizumab, and ADT in men who experienced BCR after local therapy for prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The current trial was a single-arm, phase 2 study in men
with BCR after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00658697). In total,
42 patients were enrolled between June 2008 and December 2010. One patient withdrew before the initiation of
treatment and was excluded from the analysis. Data retrieval was in September 2014.
Before enrollment, all patients provided written
informed consent. Patients were enrolled at 3 institutions:
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, Mass), Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, Mass), and the University of Maryland Medical Center (Baltimore, Md). Eligible patients had histologically documented prostatic
adenocarcinoma, which was clinically or pathologically
localized (no greater than the American Joint Committee
on Cancer category T13N1M0) and were treated with
RP, RT, or both. Eligible patients had a PSA disease recurrence with a PSADT 10 months (based on a

minimum of 3 PSA values at least 2 weeks apart). There
was no minimum PSA requirement at the time of study
entry for patients who underwent RP. For patients treated
with primary RT, the PSA level was required to be 2.0
ng/mL. The use of prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant ADT
was allowed if the duration was 8 months and testosterone was within 55 ng/dL of the institutional lower limit
of normal (lower limit of normal range was 240 ng/dL for
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 280 ng/dL for Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and 72 ng/dL for the
University of Maryland Medical Center). Prior chemotherapy was not allowed.
Patients were required to have no evidence of disease
on bone scan, chest radiograph, or computed tomography
scan, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 was
required. Required laboratory values included neutrophil
count 1500 mm3, hemoglobin 8 g/dL, platelet count
100,000/uL, normal bilirubin, normal alkaline phosphatase, and hepatic aminotransferases 1.5 times the
upper limit of normal. Patients were not eligible if they
had a second malignancy within 5 years or had received
active treatment with corticosteroids, or if they had active
infection, neuropathy requiring medical therapy, inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure
>150 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure >100 mm
Hg), a prior hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy, New York Heart Association congestive heart failure of class II, myocardial infarction or unstable angina
within 12 months of enrollment, stroke or transient ischemic attack, central nervous system disease, significant vascular disease, evidence of a bleeding diathesis or
coagulopathy, bleeding or thrombosis requiring medical
intervention within 12 months of enrollment, abdominal
fistula/perforation/abscess within 6 months of enrollment, nonhealing wound, or proteinuria (urine proteinto-creatinine ratio of 1.0 or 24-hour urine protein
>1.0 g).
Treatment

Starting on day 1, patients received docetaxel at a dose of
75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously every 3
weeks for 8 cycles, and a luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone agonist for 18 months. All patients received premedication with dexamethasone before the administration of docetaxel. Bicalutamide at a dose of 50 mg orally
per day was initiated after the completion of docetaxel (at
3 months) and continued for a total of 15 months. PSA

was measured every 3 weeks during treatment with docetaxel and/or bevacizumab, every 3 months during ADT,
and then every 3 months until PSA progression. Serum
testosterone was assessed every 3 months at the completion of ADT until testosterone was within the institutional normal range.
Outcome Assessments

The primary endpoint of the current study was the percentage of patients free from PSA progression 1 year after
the completion of ADT. PSA progression was defined as 2
serial increases in the PSA level from treatment nadir (at
least 2 weeks apart) and a PSA 0.2 ng/mL in patients
who underwent RP and a PSA of 2.0 ng/mL in patients
treated with RT (based on local laboratory measurements). The first date of increasing PSA at or above these
thresholds was considered the date of disease progression.
Radiographic evidence of disease progression was considered progression regardless of PSA measurement. Secondary endpoints included time to PSA progression (TTP)
and PSA response at the completion of docetaxel, ADT,
and 1 year after ADT completion. TTP was defined from
the initiation of chemotherapy until the date of disease
progression and in the absence of disease progression, the
TTP was censored at the time of last follow-up. A complete response was defined by 2 alternative definitions: a
PSA level <0.2 ng/mL or a PSA level 0.01 ng/mL
(based on local laboratory measurements and assay lower
limits). A PSA partial response was defined as a PSA
decrease 50% from baseline. Other PSA kinetics including median time to nadir, median nadir, and percentage
of patients achieving a 90% decrease in PSA were
described. PSA response, in reference to testosterone, was
also described. In addition, we evaluated the percentage of
patients who reinitiated ADT, developed radiologic evidence of metastatic disease, and died. Testosterone recovery after the completion of ADT was recorded. Body mass
index (BMI) at baseline and during treatment was
recorded. Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0).
Statistical Analysis

The current study was designed to differentiate a 60%
rate of patients free from PSA progression 1 year after the
completion of ADT from a 41% rate, which was
observed in our prior phase 2 trial of early docetaxel and
ADT for men with BCR after definitive local therapy for
prostate cancer.9 A sample size of 42 patients provided
80% power to detect this difference with a 2-sided a of .05.

Patient characteristics were summarized as the number (percentage) or median (interquartile range [IQR]),
corresponding to categorical and continuous variables,
respectively. The distribution of TTP and time from off
treatment to the reinitiation of ADT, as well as time from
off treatment to the development of metastasis, were estimated using the Kaplan-Meir method, and the probability of patients being free from PSA progression at 1 year
after ADT completion was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The percentages of patients
with a PSA response at prespecified time points (docetaxel
completion, ADT completion, 1 year after ADT completion) were summarized with their 95% CIs. When applicable, comparisons between groups were conducted using
the log-rank test and a P value <.05 (2-sided) was considered to be statistically significant. The statistical analysis
was performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and R statistical software
(version 2.10.1; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 41 patients were included in the analysis. Of
these, 36 patients underwent RP, 29 of whom received
2606

salvage RT and 5 of whom received RT as definitive local
therapy (Table 1). The median age of the patients who
underwent RP was 58 years compared with 60 years for
patients treated with RT. Nineteen patients (46%) had
T3 disease (defined pathologically for patients who underwent RP and clinically for patients treated with RT).
Approximately 27% of patients (11 patients) had a Gleason score of 8 to 10. The majority of patients did not
receive prior ADT (28 patients; 68%). Compared with
patients who underwent RP, patients who only received
RT had a higher PSA at the time of enrollment (10.5 ng/
mL vs 4.5 ng/mL) and shorter PSADT (3.9 months vs 4.6
months).
PSA Response

The median follow-up from the initiation of therapy was
27.5 months (IQR, 21.8-38.1 months). The median time
from the initiation of treatment to the PSA nadir was 5.5
months (IQR, 3.4-8.5 months) and the median PSA nadir
was 0.0 mg/dL for the entire cohort (Table 2). At 1 year
after the completion of ADT, the median PSA level was
0.31 ng/mL and 44% of patients (16 patients) had a PSA
level <0.2 ng/mL. An undetectable PSA (PSA 0.01 ng/
mL) was observed in 9 men (25%) at the completion of
therapy. At 1 year after the completion of ADT, 45% of

tion. At 1 year after the completion of ADT, 83% of
patients (35 patients with assessable data) had a testosterone level 100 ng/dL and 49% of patients (35 patients
with assessable data) had a testosterone level within the
normal range (240 ng/dL) (Table 4).

TTP and Patient Outcomes

At 1 year after the completion of ADT, the estimated
probability of patients remaining free from PSA progression was 98% (95% CI, 93%-100%). Two patients developed PSA progression, both of whom had testosterone
levels <100 ng/dL. Overall, 33 patients (80%) had developed PSA progression with a median TTP of 27.5 months
(95% CI, 26-38 months) (Fig. 1). TTP did not significantly correlate with age, race, Gleason score, local therapy type, prior ADT, baseline PSA, PSADT, or
testosterone level at the time of enrollment (Table 3).
Overall, 22 patients (54%) reinitiated ADT for disease progression at a median of 20.0 months (95% CI, 14
months to not reached) from ADT completion. Seven
patients (17%) developed metastatic prostate cancer at a
median of 44.6 months (95% CI, 27 months to not
reached) from therapy discontinuation. Sites of metastasis
included lymph nodes (5 patients), bone (2 patients), liver
(2 patients), lungs (1 patient), bladder (1 patient), and
prostate bed (1 patient). Two patients (5%) died, 1 secondary to progressive prostate cancer and the other secondary to cardiac amyloidosis. The cardiac amyloidosis
was deemed unrelated to study treatment.

Body Mass Index

At the completion of therapy with docetaxel, the median
BMI was 28.3 kg/m2 (IQR, 27.2-31.1 kg/m2), which is
consistent with baseline BMI (28.4 kg/m2 [IQR, 27.030.6 kg/m2]). At the time of completion of ADT, the
BMI increased to 29.4 kg/m2 (IQR, 27.2-31.7 kg/m2).
Data regarding BMI were not available 1 year after ADT
completion.
Toxicity

Testosterone Recovery

Among the 41 patients in the analysis, 16 patients (39%)
experienced grade 3 and 5 patients (12%) experienced
grade 4 treatment-related adverse events. Eleven patients
experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities related to bevacizumab
and 14 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities related
to docetaxel. The most common grade 3 treatmentrelated toxicities were neutropenia (11 patients), febrile
neutropenia (5 patients), and hypertension (4 patients)
(Table 5). Nine patients (22%) stopped or discontinued
treatment due to toxicities. One patient experienced grade
4 leukoencephalopathy approximately 1 month after
treatment with bevacizumab. This event was suspected to
be related to bevacizumab and symptoms resolved completely with supportive care.

Overall, 92% of patients (36 patients with assessable data)
had a testosterone level 100 ng/dL at an estimated median time to testosterone recovery of 9.1 months (95%
CI, 8-11 months) after the completion of ADT and 61%
of patients (22 of 36 patients) had a testosterone level
240 ng/dL at an estimated median time to recovery of

The results of the current study demonstrated that the
administration of docetaxel, bevacizumab, and ADT is
feasible in men with BCR after definitive local therapy for
prostate cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the current
study is the first to investigate multimodality systemic

therapy with chemotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy, and
ADT in men with BCR. The current study was composed
of men at high risk of metastasis given a PSADT 10
months. We demonstrated that at a median follow-up of
27.5 months, 20% of men were free from PSA disease
progression.

Clinical trials investigating combination therapy
options in patients with prostate cancer who experience
BCR are limited. We previously reported on the efficacy
and toxicity of docetaxel, estramustine, and ADT in 62
men with BCR after local therapy and demonstrated that
a percentage of patients receiving this therapy remained in
a durable PSA remission at long-term follow-up, suggesting that this approach may have cured these individuals.9
In our prior study, we reported a median TTP of 35
months compared with 27.5 months in the current study,
a finding that is most likely related to the fact that patients
being treated on this study were at higher risk, with a
requirement for PSADT of <10 months (Table 6).9,10
Another study investigating docetaxel followed by gonadal suppression and bicalutamide plus finasteride in 39
patients with BCR with or without measurable disease
(18% with metastatic disease) demonstrated that at a median follow-up of 18.9 months, 15% of patients had a
PSA level 0.1 ng/mL.14 Whether bevacizumab added
significant activity to the combination of chemotherapy
and ADT remains unanswered given the small size and
noncomparative design of this trial.
The TAX-3501 trial was a randomized, phase 3 trial
in high-risk patients with prostate cancer who were treated
with RP comparing 18 months of adjuvant ADT with or
without docetaxel administered immediately at the time
of RP or deferred until BCR occurred.15 The deferred
arm would have been a comparator for the current study;
however, the TAX-3501 trial was terminated prematurely
given enrollment and industry support challenges (target
accrual of 2172 patients). At a median follow-up of 3.4
years, of the 228 patients randomized, 18% developed either PSA or radiographic disease progression (24 patients
[22%] in the immediate-treatment arm). In addition,
TAX-3503 was also terminated early.
Given inadequate phase 3 trials to guide clinical
decision-making for men with BCR, phase 2 studies, such
as the current one, although not definitive, are informative. Furthermore, these data are highly relevant given the
results of the CHAARTED (ChemoHormonal Therapy
versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer) trial, which demonstrated
a significant improvement in OS with early docetaxel and
ADT compared with ADT alone for men with castrationsensitive, metastatic prostate cancer.8 The OS benefit in
the CHAARTED trial was more pronounced for patients
with high-volume disease (visceral metastases and/or 4
bone metastases) (49.2 months vs 32.2 months;
P 5 .0012), whereas the low-volume metastasis cohort
requires longer follow-up to ascertain benefit. This trial

raises the question of the role of early chemotherapy for
men with BCR without metastasis.
The results of the current study demonstrated that at
a median follow-up of 27.5 months, 46% of men (19
patients) were free of ADT and of patients with assessable
testosterone levels, 92% had a testosterone level 100 ng/
dL. In addition, 34 patients (82.9%) remained free from
metastasis during follow-up and there was only 1 death
(2.4%) reported to be related to prostate cancer. Although
longer follow-up is warranted, therapy is feasible and is

associated with significant PSA response rates. It is anticipated that with longer follow-up, additional patients in
this cohort will experience PSA progression; however, it is
likely that a subset of men will remain in remission from
this treatment, similar to the trials discussed earlier.9,10,14
Testosterone recovery in the current study was consistent
with previously reported rates with intermittent ADT.16
In our previous chemohormonal trial, we demonstrated that baseline PSA and prior hormonal therapy
were significant predictors of TTP.9 In the current study,
we did not demonstrate significant associations with
patient characteristics and outcomes. Possible explanations for the lack of predictive factors are the homogenous
characteristics in the current trial (all patients had highrisk disease with a short PSADT) and the small patient
cohort.

a
Approximately 11% of patients had an undetectable PSA level at long-term follow-up.

In the current study, myelosuppression and neutropenic fever, most likely related to docetaxel, were
similar to what was described in the CALGB 90401
trial, a phase 3 trial of docetaxel with or without bevacizumab in men with metastatic CRPC.12 The rates of
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in the
CALGB 90401 trial were 30% and 7%, respectively, in
the bevacizumab-containing arm. In addition, the rates
of grade 3 or 4 hypertension, likely related to bevacizumab, were similar to those reported in the CALGB trial
(7%).
Since the initiation of the current study, new
treatment options for the management of metastatic
CRPC have emerged, including 5 new therapeutic
agents:
abiraterone,
enzalutamide,
cabazitaxel,
sipuleucel-T, and alpharadin. The approval of these
agents provides a rich opportunity to explore sequential and combinatorial approaches and early administration for patients with hormone-sensitive prostate
cancer. Given the lack of an OS benefit for combination docetaxel and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic CRPC, it is unlikely that bevacizumabcontaining regimens will be evaluated further in
patients with earlier stages of disease. Furthermore,
other VEGF-targeted agents including sunitinib, aflibercept, and cabozantinib have failed to demonstrate
a benefit in OS in patients with metastatic CRPC.
Although preclinical data have implicated the VEGF
pathway in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, the
usefulness of VEGF-targeted agents in prostate cancer,
especially within the context of next-generation androgen receptor-directed therapies, remains to be determined. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the
impact of chemotherapy, including cabazitaxel (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01650285), hormonal
therapies, and immunotherapies in patients with
BCR.

Conclusions

In the current study, we demonstrated that multimodality
systemic therapy with docetaxel, bevacizumab, and ADT
was feasible and produced PSA responses in men with
BCR after definitive therapy for prostate cancer. Given
the toxicity associated with therapy, predictive biomarkers
are necessary to identify those patients likely to benefit
from this type of aggressive approach. We believe that intensive multimodal systemic treatment of a limited duration may benefit a subset of patients with high-risk BCR.
Long-term follow-up is needed to determine the percentage of patients who have a durable PSA response and are
able to remain off further therapy for prostate cancer.
