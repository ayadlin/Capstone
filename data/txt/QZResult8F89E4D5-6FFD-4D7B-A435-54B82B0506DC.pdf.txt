The Role of TLR4 in Chemotherapy-Driven
Metastasis
Sophia Ran

Abstract
Tumor resistance to cytotoxic drugs is one of the main
obstacles to successful cancer therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that chemoresistance is promoted by substances released
from dead and damaged cells that activate the host repair
program orchestrated by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). TLR4 is
often overexpressed in malignant and tumor-inﬁltrating
immune cells. In addition to endogenous ligands released by
therapy-induced tumor destruction, TLR4 is directly activated
by paclitaxel, one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs against various human cancers. TLR4 activation
promotes local and systemic inﬂammation, leading to induction of multiple circuits that create a regenerative environment
favoring local recurrence and metastasis. Of particular impor-

tance is TLR4-mediated recruitment of endothelial progenitors
derived from immature myeloid cells. These cells play a major
role in rebuilding tumor-associated lymphatic and blood vessels, thereby promoting lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis. The latter is further enhanced by the premetastatic niche
generated by mobilization of myeloid provascular cells to
distant organs. This review summarizes the recent evidence
demonstrating that paclitaxel and other clinically used anticancer drugs actively induce metastasis even while shrinking
the primary tumor. Better understanding of the mechanisms
underlying TLR4-dependent chemotherapy-driven metastasis
might be the key to overcoming challenges of cancer eradication. Cancer Res; 75(12); 2405–10. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; ref. 8). Activation of TLR4 and similar
receptors in immune cells fulﬁlls several important defense functions such as increased survival, motility, and invasion of pathogen-ﬁghting cells that allow them to quickly access the affected
site and destroy the invaders. One of the important functions of
TLR4 signaling is to rebuild damaged vasculature at the site of
injury in order to maintain continuous communication with the
host. This is achieved by expanding the pools of provascular
progenitors in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen followed by
their recruitment to inﬂamed or remodeled tissue. In the context
of cancer, these normal host responses to injury promote metastasis because they endow the tumor cells surviving chemotherapy
with increased invasive capacity while simultaneously providing
the means for their transportation. To make things worse, one of
the most commonly used drugs, paclitaxel, directly stimulates
TLR4 (9). Coupled with tumor-protective host mechanisms,
paclitaxel therapy might be a driving force for metastasis, particularly in patients with advanced tumor burden or genetic predisposition to evasion of apoptosis. This review will summarize the
current understanding of the mechanisms mediated by host
immune cells and cytotoxic drugs that cumulatively promote
rather than inhibit metastatic behavior. Validation of this concept
could fundamentally change the clinical paradigms for cancer
therapy to account for unwanted consequences of an activated
TLR4 pathway and the host responses to tissue loss.

Cytotoxic drugs remain the main, and sometimes the only,
therapeutic modality for advanced, refractory, and metastatic
tumors as well as for those cancers lacking a speciﬁc molecular
target. The main drugs used clinically for anticancer therapy are
anthracyclines, platin-based, and various taxanes. Although these
drugs are highly efﬁcacious in killing cultured tumor cells, application of chemotherapy to cancer patients results in up to 40% of
recurrence at a primary, locoregional, or distant site (1). The
underlying mechanisms of recurrence are multifaceted. Recent
studies suggest that, in addition to genetic alterations in malignant cells, the local tumor environment and systemic host
responses to injury strongly contribute to reducing drug efﬁcacy
(2–4). Moreover, some studies show that chemotherapy by itself
can instigate metastatic spread while simultaneously restraining
growth of the primary tumor (5–7). Such counterintuitive outcomes of cytotoxic therapies might be explained by two synergistic events: the natural tendency of the host to protect and repair
sites of injury coupled with limitations of the immune system to
recognize all malignant cells as non-self. The host response to
chemotherapy-inﬂicted tumor destruction is remarkably similar
to that occurring during sepsis, chronic inﬂammation, and other
deviations from homeostasis. In all of these instances, the main
host receptor that senses and responds to tissue damage is

Biologic Modiﬁers of the Tumor Response
to Chemotherapy In Vivo
Initially, overexpression of drug-excluding pumps in tumor
cells was thought to be the main reason for resistance to cytotoxic
therapy (10). However, after decades-long exploration, pharmacologic inhibition of these pumps failed to eliminate the problem.
This suggested that alternative powerful mechanisms in vivo may

contribute to limitations of cytotoxic therapies for cancer treatment. This conclusion is supported by extensive evidence showing
the protective effect of the tumor environment (11), including
upregulation of prosurvival proteins in tumor and tumor-associated cells. Superﬁcially, the idea that cytotoxic drugs enhance
survival of malignant cells appears counterintuitive. It is consistent, however, with well-known physiologic responses to the
organ damage, necrosis, and hypoxia that invariably occur due
to collapse of blood vasculature during tissue loss. Such outcomes
of successful chemotherapy are typically compensated by massive
inﬂux of progenitors programmed to restore homeostasis by
rebuilding epithelial, stromal, and vascular structures in damaged
tissue. Therefore, tumor eradication in vivo may depend not only
on genetically dictated sensitivity of malignant cells to cytotoxic
drugs but also on an inﬂammation-amplifying host response
caused by drug-induced damage (11).
Paclitaxel as a prototype of anticancer drugs with functionally
opposing effects on tumor growth
Paclitaxel is an excellent example of an anticancer drug that
both efﬁciently kills tumor cells and promotes their survival.
Paclitaxel cytotoxicity is mediated by binding to b-tubulin, an
event that overstabilizes microtubules, leading to interruption of
the cell cycle, blockade of mitosis, and eventually, cell death (12).
Although early studies demonstrated undeniable efﬁcacy of paclitaxel against many types of metastatic and refractory cancers
(13), they also showed drug-speciﬁc activation of the NF-kB
pathway leading to transcriptional induction of numerous
inﬂammatory genes (14). The shift to proinﬂammatory phenotype induced by paclitaxel was detected in mouse macrophages
(9) and human tumor cells (14) as well as in the blood of breast
cancer patients receiving paclitaxel monotherapy (15). Studies in
vitro showed that the kinetics and expression proﬁle of paclitaxelaltered genes strongly resemble those induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; refs. 16, 17), a pathogen-derived molecule with strong
inﬂammatory properties. Initially, paclitaxel-mediated inﬂammatory response was thought to enhance the tumoricidal effects
of immune cells, and therefore, was regarded as beneﬁcial for
cancer patients (14). Subsequent studies showed that paclitaxelinduced inﬂammatory mediators promote tumor cell survival
(18), suggesting that drug-associated inﬂammation blunts tumor
sensitivity to anticancer drugs (19) rather than helping to mount
the antitumor defense. Although many questions in this area of
investigation are still open, multiple studies using human clinical
cancers favor the hypothesis that paclitaxel-induced inﬂammation leads to progression of tumor growth. Studies in breast,
ovarian, prostate, and other tumors showed that TLR4, a natural
LPS receptor, is highly upregulated in malignant epithelial cells
(20–22), and paclitaxel signals through TLR4 (21, 23). Because
paclitaxel is a functional mimetic of LPS (9), both compounds
elicit nearly identical responses in TLR4-positive myeloid cells and
in cancer cells with upregulated TLR4 expression. Paclitaxel similarly to LPS causes dimerization of TLR4, which, in turn, activates
the NF-kB pathway (23), leading to upregulation of numerous
inﬂammatory, migratory, and prosurvival proteins (e.g., VEGF-A,
COX2, IL6, IL8, MMP9, XIAP, and Bcl-2; refs. 24–26). These
proteins cumulatively confer resistance to cell death (26), evasion
from immunosurveillance (27), and increased metastasis (6).
Consistently, silencing TLR4 expression restores tumor cell sensitivity to paclitaxel in vitro (21, 23) and correlates with signiﬁcant
increase in tumor-free animals after chemotherapy in breast

tumor models in vivo (6, 23). These studies suggest that while
paclitaxel is highly toxic to TLR4-negative or low-expressing
tumor cells, it is cytoprotective or even growth-promoting for
cancer cells expressing high TLR4 levels. Therefore, TLR4 could be
an important discriminating marker to distinguish between paclitaxel-responsive and -resistant cancers.
Mechanisms by which paclitaxel therapy promotes metastasis
If cytotoxic drugs could be administrated at the unlimited dose
and time required for tumor eradication, the ability of these drugs
to kill tumor cells would probably prevail over tumor-promoting
actions. However, since all cytotoxic therapies are restricted by
toxicities, the drug pro-oncogenic effects on surviving tumor cells
can translate into local and distant recurrence. Paclitaxel, specifically, has been shown to promote metastasis by multiple
mechanisms. The primary effects on TLR4-positive tumor cells
are: (i) enhancement of tumor inﬂammation (23), the hallmark
of the activated TLR4 pathway and a well-known promoter of
tumor growth; (ii) induction of a migratory/invasive phenotype
in tumor cells (28), an essential prerequisite for escaping the
primary tumor site; and (iii) upregulation of prosurvival Bcl-2,
XIAP, and Bcl-XL proteins (29) that promote resistance to anoikis
and successful establishment of metastatic lesions. Although all
these activities promote metastatic behavior, paclitaxel's ability to
increase tumor cell invasion might be of particular signiﬁcance. In
the screen using 1,300 compounds and a variety of human cancer
lines, paclitaxel was shown as one of the most potent inducers of
invadopodia, i.e., cell protrusion required for invasion (28). This
prometastatic effect of paclitaxel is exponentially magniﬁed by a
regenerative environment of the primary tumor created by
inﬂamed tumor cells and BM-recruited monocytes (23).
Paclitaxel-induced inﬂammation in tumor cells is phenotypically identical to that induced by LPS in normal immune cells.
However, the magnitude of the response might be much higher in
the context of cancer because particularly large tumors can generate inﬂammatory conditions greatly surpassing the outcome of
tissue-recruited mononuclear inﬁltrates. Qualitatively, activation
of TLR4 in either situation aims at restoration of homeostasis by
remodeling the damaged tissue while protecting the residual cells
during repair. Consistent with this concept, we recently demonstrated in breast cancer models that paclitaxel supports TLR4þ
tumors by expanding provascular BM progenitors and recruiting
them to the damaged site (6) as well as by the local upregulation
of inﬂammatory cytokines and their receptors in tumor cells, thus
creating autocrine tumor-protecting loops (23).
One of the most deleterious consequences of tumor activation
of TLR4 results is mobilization of provascular progenitors to the
damaged site. BM-derived cells (BMDC) that include hematopoietic, myeloid, and endothelial progenitors have been repeatedly
implicated in promoting the growth of primary tumors and
priming the distant sites to favor extravasation and metastatic
outgrowth (30). Human BMDC are signiﬁcantly increased in
paclitaxel-treated tumors as shown, for instance, by a 5-fold
increase of CD14þ myeloid progenitors in breast cancers of
treated women relative to untreated patients (31). Paclitaxel can
also directly mobilize BMDC to the lungs as shown in non–
tumor-bearing mice with a signiﬁcantly higher number of lung
homing tumor cells in treated animals relative to controls (7).
Consequently, drug-treated hosts had a signiﬁcantly higher number of pulmonary metastases relative to untreated mice (7).
Paclitaxel can also activate TLR4 in blood vascular endothelial

Therapy-Caused Tumor Progression

cells, which may explain the direct effect of paclitaxel on pulmonary vessel remodeling (4). The exposure of endothelial cells to
paclitaxel in vivo impaired the vascular barrier, leading to
increased tumor cell lodging and consequent metastasis (4). We
recently showed that these effects of paclitaxel on preparing the
distant organs for potential tumor invasion are ampliﬁed by
systemic inﬂammation recorded in the blood, lungs, spleen,
lymph nodes, and BM. Induction of these systemic inﬂammatory
circuits substantially increases pools of myeloid-derived provascular progenitors that subsequently are recruited to the tumor and
distant organs and promote vascular outgrowth (6).
One of the earliest events in either physiologic tissue repair or
tumor recovery after chemotherapy is regeneration of blood
vasculature. Supporting this concept, multiple studies show that
chemotherapy-induced provascular BMDC play a paramount role
in induction of tumor angiogenesis and consequent hematogenous metastasis (32). We recently expanded this concept by
demonstrating that paclitaxel therapy of TLR4-positive (but not
negative) breast tumors also increases the number of lymphatic
vessels that were highly permissive for invasion by malignant cells
(6). The preferential invasion of the lymphatics might be due to
their defective formation deep inside the recurring tumor—an
unusual site for tumor-induced lymphatics even in metastatic
cancers. Albeit deformed, the new intratumoral lymphatics (in
mice with TLR4-positive tumors treated with paclitaxel) increased
the burden of lymph node metastases by more than 250-fold
relative to untreated animals or tumors lacking TLR4 (6). These
studies attest to the alarming potential of paclitaxel to augment
metastasis of TLR4-positive tumors by direct upregulation of
prometastatic genes in neoplastic cells, and indirectly, through
recruitment of immature BMDC that contribute to formation of
new tumor vasculature.
Other cytotoxic drugs with prometastatic activities
The pro-oncogenic effects of chemotherapy are not limited to
paclitaxel by virtue of the fact that TLR4 can be activated by 20 or
more endogenous ligands released from damaged or dead cells
(33). The list of TLR4-activating factors includes many dangersensing proteins known as "alarmins" such as HMGB1, S100A8/
A9, and various heat-shock proteins (33). It should be mentioned
that host response to alarmins is very complex, and the endogenous ligands of TLR4 can generate pro-oncogenic effects via
various TLRs (34) as well as additional homeostasis-maintaining
receptors (35). In fact, it has not been ﬁrmly established that
functional effects of paclitaxel are mediated through physical
binding to TLR4. Alternatively, paclitaxel might activate TLR4
indirectly by alarmins released from dead cells. If alarmins are
ultimately responsible for activation of TLR4, any cytotoxic drug
can potentially generate a proinﬂammatory response, which
might be sufﬁcient to rescue residual cells from apoptosis, thereby
initiating tumor regrowth.
This idea is strongly supported by mounting evidence indicating that several structurally unrelated drugs induce tumor and
host responses that strikingly resemble the effects of paclitaxel.
Activation of NF-kB and resultant inﬂammatory response have
been noted after tumor or host cell exposure to at least ﬁve drugs
other than paclitaxel, including doxorubicin, 5-ﬂuoracil (5-FU),
oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin (36). Similarly to
paclitaxel, stimulation of the NF-kB pathway by these drugs led to
activation of the MAPK pathway, upregulation of the proinﬂammatory AP-2 transcription factor (37), and overexpression of

www.aacrjournals.org

inﬂammatory (36), prosurvival (29), and migratory genes (38).
The TLR4-dependent inﬂammatory response induced by various
chemodrugs was also implicated in promoting epithelial–mesenchymal transition (36) and selecting tumor cells with the stemlike phenotype (39). Acquisition of these traits is strongly associated with metastatic behavior reﬂecting the diversity of mechanisms by which TLR4, in conjunction with chemotherapy, can
promote metastasis.
Paclitaxel and other cytotoxic agents share an additional functional aspect: all chemodrugs prompt BM to dispatch massive
amounts of myeloid progenitors to the tumor. Studies with
various chemodrugs also showed that the circulating BM-derived
progenitors can be absorbed by the lungs (4, 7, 37). This event
may initiate the preparation of the premetastatic niche because
lung-recruited BMDC secrete inﬂammatory and vascular remodeling factors that increase extravasation of circulating tumor cells
(4, 40), and create a tissue-regenerative environment (4). Thus,
inﬂammatory factors produced by tumor TLR4 initiate the development of the niche while cytokines produced by lung-recruited
BMDC advance its formation.
Prometastatic effects of several cytotoxic drugs have recently
been reported in multiple animal models and clinical studies.
Doxorubicin injected into non–tumor-bearing mice has been
shown to induce the formation of the inﬂammasome (a multiprotein complex that generates mature IL1b) in BM cells (41). This
is signiﬁcant because fully processed IL1b induces a secondary
inﬂammatory wave by upregulating IL6, G-CSF, and other mediators (41). An unrelated drug, cyclophosphamide, has been
shown to promote the growth of primary tumors (42), BMDC
homing to the lungs (43), enhancement of bone (5) and lung (43)
metastases in mice, and increased circulating myeloid-derived
suppressor cells in cancer patients (44). The impact of the cyclophosphamide-induced and host-propagated prometastatic effect
can be as high as a 1,000-fold increase in pulmonary lesions
formed by circulating tumor cells in drug-pretreated mice relative
to controls (45). Similarly, pretreatment with cisplatin increased
inﬂux of provascular BMDC to primary tumors and the burden of
pulmonary metastases by 6- to 10-fold (4). Cisplatin also significantly shortened tumor growth doubling time in lung cancer
patients (46). A similar compound, oxaliplatin, increased spontaneous metastasis in an orthotopic mouse cancer model (38).
Collectively, these studies suggest that damage-sensing receptors
might be ultimately responsible for induction of the cytoprotective and provascular inﬂammatory responses that negate the
clinical beneﬁts of cytotoxic therapies.

Summary and Perspectives—How to
Eliminate Tumor-Promoting Effects of
Chemotherapy
Emerging evidence from multiple tumor models and clinical
studies suggests a distinct possibility that commonly used anticancer drugs promote tumor cell survival and facilitate metastasis
in addition to their cytotoxic effects. The main culprit underlying
the prometastatic effects of chemotherapy appears to be druginduced inﬂammation (Fig. 1). This response is induced by TLR4
and similar damage-sensing receptors that bear natural responsibility for restoring homeostasis to the injured tissue. In the
context of TLR4-positive tumors, this local response is rapidly
translated to systemic inﬂammation through excessive production of mediators released to the blood that expand the pools of

chemotherapy. TLR4 expressed in
tumor cells can be activated by a
chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel,
and numerous endogenous ligands,
including HSP90 and HMGB1.
TLR4-activated NF-kB signaling leads
to upregulation of metalloproteinases
and inﬂammatory cytokines that
enhance tumor motility and local
inﬂammation. This proinﬂammatory
shift protects tumor cells from the
toxicity of anticancer drugs and
endows them with better capacity to
migrate out of the primary site.
Excessive cytokines released to the
blood generate systemic inﬂammation
that causes expansion of bone marrow
progenitors and their mobilization to
the tumor. Blood-circulating
progenitors also lodge in the lungs
where they generate a highly
receptive environment for passing
tumor cells. Myeloid-derived blood
vascular and lymphatic endothelial
progenitors (M-LECP) create a
regenerative environment typiﬁed
by accelerated formation of new
blood and lymphatic vessels.
Increased migratory and survival
potentials of tumor cells, coupled with
increased blood and lymphatic vessel
densities, result in local recurrence as
well as lymphatic and distant
metastasis. Systemic dissemination is
also supported by generation of the
premetastatic niche in lungs and other
organs. Cumulatively, these events

BM and spleen progenitors. While drug-induced apoptosis
shrinks the tumor, upregulated products of the activated TLR4
pathway protect the residual tumor cells and enhance their
dissemination. This prometastatic trend is strongly ampliﬁed by
the host "misreading" the damage signals from the drugdestroyed tumor. The host translates these signals into a massive
regenerative effort led by provascular and immunosuppressive

BMDC. The widely documented immunosuppressive phenotype
of tumor BMDC (47) is congruent with the late immune cell
function of rebuilding the injured tissue rather than their early
role in attacking undesirable cells. Once mobilized to the tumor,
BMDC promote tumor vasculature that connects new blood and
lymphatic vessels to systemic circulation. Access to new vasculature might be a deciding event in posttherapy tumor spread, also

favored by the cytoprotective atmosphere of the remodeled tumor
mass. BMDC also support distant metastasis because circulating
immature progenitors lodge into the lungs and other organs
where their vascular and tissue remodeling properties enhance
extravasation of tumor cells and sustained expansion of metastatic colonies, respectively (Fig. 1).
Although TLR4 activation in malignant cells clearly beneﬁts the
tumor, stimulation of this pathway in immune cells might have
both pro- and anticancer consequences. For instance, immune
cells depend on TLR4 activation for effective antigen presentation
and recruitment of cytotoxic T cells. This may result in decreased
growth of primary tumors due to chemotherapy-induced TLR4
signaling in BMDC and other immune cells (48). This "doubleedged sword" role of immune cells in chemotherapy highlights
the pressing need to deﬁne local tumor and systemic circumstances that lead to TLR4 tumor–suppressing effects as opposed to
prometastatic actions.
Future studies could clarify this point by providing answers to
several outstanding questions. First, it should be clearly determined in clinical cancers whether the expression of TLR4 or other
TLRs correlates with their metastatic and therapy-resistant potentials. Some work on this aspect has already been done (20), but the
direct link between recurrence and cancer expression of TLRs has
not been established. Second, future studies should determine
whether TLR expression in malignant or tumor-associated cells
can serve as a biomarker for sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy.
Potential utility of TLR tumor expression might signiﬁcantly
improve early clinical recognition of difﬁcult-to-treat tumors and
tailor the therapy accordingly. Third, it is essential to deﬁne the
prometastatic and therapy-evasion mechanisms mediated by TLRdependent damage-responsive pathways. It has been established
that activation of these pathways protects tumor cells, generates
new vessels, and enhances tumor spread. However, many details

of these processes are unknown or poorly understood. We do
not know the identity of all receptors sensing chemotherapyinduced tumor injury nor do we clearly understand the molecular
basis of interactions of TLRs with anticancer drugs and endogenous ligands. It is possible, for instance, that analogous to LPS,
drug activation of TLR4 requires speciﬁc coreceptors; however,
this important aspect of TLR4 activation by cytotoxic drugs is
currently unknown. Lastly, the use of experimental models can
help to assess the ability of TLR-targeting drugs to sensitize tumors
to cytotoxic therapies as well as to intercept lymphatic and distant
metastasis. Here, translational science should beneﬁt from the
plethora of existing TLR4 antagonists generated to combat sepsis
that have already demonstrated an acceptable safety proﬁle in
human subjects. Cumulatively, exploration of these questions
should provide the mechanistic details of TLR-mediated resistance
to cytotoxic therapies and be a signiﬁcant step forward in addressing current challenges to eradicating cancer.
