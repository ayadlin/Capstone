Abstract
Development of novel therapy for patients with tumor is still a
challenge at the present time. We designed a fusion peptide
(RK5) with two targets as a novel agent against tumor. The
fusion peptide RK5 containing the kringle 5 fragment of
human plasminogen and a decapeptide (CTTHWGFTLC) was
constructed and expressed in yeast. Matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) activity, proliferation, and migration of endothelial
cells were examined in vitro, respectively. Angiogenesis, tumor
growth, metastasis, and survival time were evaluated in in vivo
models. Administration of RK5 was delivered by both protein
and gene approach. The results showed that RK5 inhibited the
activity of MMP-9 and exhibited more inhibitory effects on
proliferation and migration of endothelial cells than that of
kringle 5 fragment and decapeptide individually. RK5 also
inhibited angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis and
increased survival time of mice bearing tumor. In addition,
the effectiveness of RK5 could be achieved by both protein and
gene delivery. In conclusion, RK5 has potential to inhibit
tumor growth and metastasis and to prolong survival time of
animals bearing tumor. Therefore, fusion peptide RK5
with two targets provides a new design for the development
of antitumor drugs and has potential for clinical application.

Introduction
Tumor has been viewed as an angiogenesis abnormal disease (1).
Angiogenesis is tightly controlled by angiogenic and antiangiogenic
systems (2). For the angiogenic system, there are two groups of
factors. One stimulates or inhibits endothelial cell proliferation
and/or induces endothelial cell elongation, migration, and vascular
morphogenesis, and includes vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; refs. 3, 4), angiostatin, endostatin, and pigment epitheliumderived factor (5, 6), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; ref. 7),
platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (8) and the tie and
tek receptors (9, 10). The others are involved in the breakdown
of basement membranes and extracellular matrix, and include
proteases and their receptors such as the members of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP; ref. 11), cathepsins (12), and enzymes
involved in the plasmin cascade. It is known that MMPs mediate
multiple pathologic processes, including tumor growth and
metastasis (13).
For the antiangiogenic system, several native factors have been
identified, such as tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP; ref. 14),

angiostatin (15), endostatin (16), and thrombospondins (17).
Kringle domains of plasminogen also display a strong antiangiogenic activity (18), especially plasminogen kringle 5 (K5; ref. 18). K5
induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of proliferating endothelial
cells (19). Intravitreal injection of recombinant K5 prevents the
development and progression of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization in a rat model (20), implicating that K5 has a
potential therapeutic application in angiogenesis-related diseases.
At present, synthetic protein or peptide treatment shows
promising antiangiogenic activity. However, most of the therapeutic protein and peptide exhibit a single target on the angiogenic
system, such as either inhibiting proliferation, elongation, migration of endothelial cells, and vascular morphogenesis, or inhibiting
enzymes that promote tumor development, growth, and metastasis. The current study investigates the effects of a fusion peptide of
decapeptide and K5 on MMP-9 and endothelial cells as an
antitumor agent.

Materials and Methods
Construction of yeast and mammalian expression vectors of RK5.
The plasmid pET21b-K5 was used as a template to amplify human
plasminogen kringle (K5) as described previously (21). K5 cDNA was then
subcloned into pPIC9K to form pPIC9K-K5. In addition, K5 cDNA was
ligated with cDNA sequence of decapeptide (CTTHWGFTLC) and
subcloned into pPIC9K vector at the sites of XhoI and EcoRI to form
pPIC9K-RK5. The pPIC9K-K5 and pPIC9K-RK5 vector was employed and
transfected into Pichia pastoris. K5 and RK5 were expressed as described
previously (21). Decapeptide was synthesized by GL Biochem. RK5 cDNA
was also obtained from the pPIC9K-RK5 vector by PCR with the forward
primer 5¶-GCAGAATTCACCATGGCCCTGTGGATGCGCCT-3¶ and reverse
primer 5¶-GGTCACTCAACATGTGTAGGCTGCGGCTGGGTCAGG-3¶. The
RK5 cDNA was then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector of
pcDNA3.1 at the sites of EcoRI and HindIII to form pcDNA3.1-RK5 for
gene therapy.
Administration of mammalian expression vector into animals.
Hyaluronidase (359 units/mg; Sigma) was dissolved in sterile saline and
injected into the mouse quadriceps at a dose of 36 U per site in a volume of
50 AL. After 1 h, 50 Ag of pcDNA3.1-RK5 in 50 AL saline was injected into the
same site, immediately followed by square-wave electric pulses using two
stainless electrodes placed 5 mm apart at each side of the injected muscle.
An electroporator ECM 830 (Genetronics) was used to deliver 16  20-ms
pulses of 80 V/cm field strength at a frequency of 2 Hz. The treatment was
repeated after 1 week. The concentrations of RK5 in the blood serum were
measured by RIA using 125I-labeled RK5 on days 3, 8, 13, and 18 after
injection.
Cell migration assay. The BD BioCoat Matrigel invasion chamber (BD
Bioscience) was used for cell migration assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
(HUVEC; 2.5  104) were seeded onto Matrigel-coated filters in 50 AL
serum-free medium with K5, RK5, and decapeptide at a concentration of
40 Ag/mL, respectively, and incubated for 0.5 h, followed by adding another
50 AL serum-free medium. In the lower chambers, 10 ng/mL VEGF was
added as a chemoattractant. After 24 h incubation, the filters were stained

a microscope with magnification of 400. Migration number was
normalized to cell proliferation under the same conditions as control.
Cell proliferation assay. Monolayers of HUVECs were maintained in
RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and bFGF (3 ng mL 1).
Cell proliferation was evaluated as described previously (20, 21). Briefly, 105
cells in 1 mL RPMI 1640 were seeded into 12-well plate coated with
fibronectin (1 ng/mL). After 24 h culture at 37jC, the medium was replaced
by 0.5 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS with different
concentrations of K5, RK5, and decapeptide, respectively. Cells were
subjected to 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay after incubation with K5, RK5, and decapeptide for 72 h.
MMP-9 enzymatic assay. About 100 ng of human recombinant MMP-9
(hrMMP-9) from R&D Systems Co. were preincubated with K5, RK5, and
decapeptide, respectively, for 60 min at concentrations as indicated in the
text. The casein (52 mmol/L) from Sigma Co. was added and incubated for 1 to
4 h at 22jC according to MMP-9 enzymatic assay kit (R&D System Co.). Degradation of casein by MMP-9 was analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE.
Mice models of tumor inoculation and peptide treatment. Different
mice were employed for different tumor cell inoculation. Male C57BL/6
mice were used for Lewis Lung Cancer (LLC) cells. Mice were 7–8 weeks old
and housed in plastic cages with five mice in each cage and were allowed
free access to food and water. Animal procedure protocol was approved by
the Peking University, which complies with national standards established
by the National Council of Animal’s Use of China.
LLC cells were suspended in medium with VEGF (5 ng/mL) or bFGF
(5 ng/mL) at a concentration of 2  106/0.1 mL/mouse (cell viability >85%)
for 0.5 h and then injected s.c. into right front axilla of mice. Tumor
appearance and growth were evaluated once every 2 days after cell
injection. The day of tumor size that reached to 1 cm3 was designated day 0.
K5 (50 mg/kg/day), RK5 (50 mg/kg/day), and decapeptide (25 mg/kg/day)
were injected into mice i.p. once a day for 2 weeks. The growth of tumors
was measured once every 2 days using vernier calipers. Tumor tissues and
lungs from each animal were obtained for histologic staining with H&E and
immunohistochemical staining, which were fixed in 4% polyformaldehyde
and embedded with paraffin.

rehydrated in graded alcohols. Microvessel staining was carried out with
peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin method (ultrasensitive S-P Kit from
Maixia Bio). Mouse monoclonal antibody against CD34 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), which recognized the endothelial cell, was incubated with
tumor tissue section at a dilution of 1:1,000. After washing, tissue sections
were further incubated with secondary biotinylated rabbit antibody against
mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) at a dilution of 1:1,000 (Santa Cruz

Biotechnology) and followed by incubation of peroxidase-conjugated avidin
at a dilution of 1:1,000. Tissue sections were visualized by incubation with
substrates of 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Microvessel density in tumor
tissue was evaluated by counting the number of vessels in five fields per
section at 200 (0.739 mm2 per field).

Results
Expression of RK5 and its inhibition of MMP-9 in vitro. We
have constructed a fusion peptide of RK5, which contains the K5
domain of human plasminogen [80 amino acids (aa)] and a 10-aa
peptide (decapeptide) that specifically inhibits the activities of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 (22). After transfection of RK5 into yeast and
293 cells, the expression and purification of RK5 is shown in Fig. 1.
In yeast extract, the purified RK5 protein band was larger than the
purified K5 band (Fig. 1A). In 293T cells, RK5 could be identified in
both culture medium and cell lysis (Fig. 1B). The effect of RK5 on
the inhibition of MMP-9 was first examined by employing purified
RK5 from yeast. As shown in Fig. 1C, MMP-9 degradation of casein
could be prevented by decapeptide but not by K5. Moreover, RK5
inhibited MMP-9 degradation of casein in a dose-dependent manner.
RK5 inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Purified RK5 was employed to incubate with HUVECs for cell
proliferation and migration assays. As shown in Fig. 2A, with an
increase in concentrations of K5 and RK5, there was a decrease in
HUVEC proliferation. K5 and RK5 were equally active. However,
synthetic decapeptide did not inhibit HUVEC proliferation. HUVEC
migration was examined with K5, RK5, and decapeptide. As shown
in Fig. 2B, K5, RK5, and decapeptide significantly inhibited HUVEC
migration. Inhibitory effects of K5 and decapeptide were less than
that of RK5.
Inhibition of tumor growth and increased survival of mice
bearing LLC by K5 and RK5. To examine the effects of K5 and
RK5 on tumor growth and mice survival, we employed the mouse
model of LLC. After inoculation of LLC cells pretreated with bFGF
into mice, mice were given K5, RK5, and decapeptide, respectively,
daily for 8 days. Tumor volume and mice survival were evaluated
as shown in Fig. 3. The serum level of RK5 appeared at 24 and
48 h after i.p. injection of RK5 with a peak at 24 h (Fig. 3A). Tumor
growth was significantly attenuated with the treatment of K5 and
RK5 (Fig. 3B and Table 1). However, decapeptide could not inhibit
tumor growth, whereas RK5 seemed to have a stronger inhibition
of tumor growth than K5 did. Moreover, K5, RK5, and decapeptide
all improved the survival rate of mice inoculated with LLC cells
(Fig. 3C), whereas mice treated with RK5 seemed to survive more
than mice treated with K5 and decapeptide, respectively.
Furthermore, bFGF-treated LLC cells could facilitate the migration
of cancer cells to the lung (data not shown). Treatments of K5, RK5,
and decapeptide could reduce lung metastasis of LLC (Fig. 3D).
RK5 showed better inhibition of metastasis than K5 and
decapeptide, respectively.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

Inhibition of angiogenesis of K5, RK5, and decapeptide. We
have shown above that K5 and RK5 could inhibit endothelial cell
proliferation, and we further investigated the effects of K5, RK5,
and decapeptide on tumor angiogenesis. As shown in Fig. 4 and
Table 2, K5 and RK5 dramatically reduced the angiogenesis of the
tumor. RK5 treatment seemed to have a stronger inhibition than
K5 and decapeptide.
Gene delivery of RK5 inhibits tumor growth and prolongs
the survival of mice bearing LLC cells. To examine whether RK5
could be used as gene therapy, we constructed the fusion peptide in a
mammalian expression vector with insulin signal peptide that
allows RK5 secreting (Fig. 1A). Moreover, after the injection of the
vector into the right back sural muscle of the mice, the serum level of
RK5 was detected at 3 days after injection of RK5, peaked at 8 days,
and gradually decreased over 18 days (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the
injection of RK5 expression vector into the right back sural muscle of
mice inhibited the LLC tumor growth in the mice (Fig. 5B) and
increased the survival of mice bearing LLC (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
K5 of the human plasminogen has widely been used as an
antiangiogenesis agent recently (18, 20). It has been shown that K5
induced apoptosis of endothelial and tumor cells through surfaceexpressed glucose-regulated protein 78 (23). Moreover, K5-engineered glioma cells blocked the migration of tumor-associated
macrophages and suppressed tumor vascularization and progression (24). Furthermore, gene transfer of kringle 1-5 caused a
significant reduction in vessel density with suppression of tumor
growth of the hepatoma cell lines. Kringle 1-5 was also able to
prolong the survival period and reduce the number of intrahepatic
metastases. Expression of kringle 1-5 protein was detected on
hepatoma cells and hepatocytes in the liver. In addition, kringle 1-5
did not alter serum alanine aminotransferase levels and body
weights, suggesting the suitability of kringle 1-5 for gene therapy
(25). However, combination of K5 with other peptides on tumor
vascularization and progression has never been reported. This is
the first report of modulation of the activity of the plasminogen
protein by a targeting peptide.

Targeting MMPs and Endothelial Cells

Figure 5. Gene delivery of RK5 inhibited LLC tumor growth and increased survival rate of mice bearing LLC. Inoculation of LLC was the same as indicated in
Fig. 3, whereas mammalian expression pcDNA3.1-RK5 was injected into the right back sural muscle of mice as described in Materials and Methods. A, serum level
of RK5 after injection. The RK5 was detected after 3 d injection and peaked at 8 d. B, inhibition of LLC tumor growth. C, increase in survival rate of mice after
RK5 treatment, respectively.

MMPs are a family of enzymes capable of degrading the
constituents of the extracellular matrix and the basement
membrane. The two MMPs that closely correlated with the
metastatic potential are the MMP-2 and MMP-9, both of which
degrade denatured collagens and type IV collagen present in the
basement membrane (26). Identification of MMP-9 binding peptide
from phage display peptide libraries showed that a decapeptide
(CTTHWGFTLC) was a potent inhibitor of MMP-9 (22). Therefore,
we designed and prepared a fusion peptide RK5 that contains K5
and decapeptide. The recombinant RK5 showed significant
inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Fig. 2).
Moreover, RK5 was able to inhibit Lewis lung cancer cell growth and
metastasis (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Besides, RK5 also inhibits other
cancer cell growth and metastasis in the animal model (data not
shown), which indicates that the effects of RK5 are not an artifact
associated with the use of the LLC cell line only. Our results are the
first to report the combination of K5 with the MMP inhibitor for the
treatment of cancer, although a combination of VEGF blockade and
MMP inhibition for the treatment of experimental human
pancreatic cancer has been reported (27). Furthermore, combination therapy with Rho kinase and MMP inhibitor was also able to
inhibit angiogenesis and growth of human prostate cancer
xenograft (28). Therefore, it should be expected that the recombinant fusion peptide RK5 has a better improvement in the treatment
of tumor by targeting both MMPs and endothelial cells. These two
targets have been well recognized as a major therapy for cancer.
Inhibition of MMPs has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and
metastasis (29), whereas attenuation of angiogenesis is well
documented to inhibit tumor growth in both tumor models and

clinical trials (30). Therefore, the fusion peptide RK5 may exert a
synergistic effect on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.
We also showed that the gene delivery approach could result in
the same effect on tumor growth and metastasis as with the
protein delivery approach. The inhibition rate for tumor growth by
gene transfer was f55% (Fig. 5), whereas it was f50–60% by
protein delivery (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Compared with the protein
delivery approach, gene delivery has some advantages, such as less
injection. In our study, only two injections in a week were given
during the observation for gene therapy groups, whereas one
injection a day for 8 days were given to mice during the
observation for protein delivery groups. In addition, gene delivery
can keep relatively higher level and longer time of RK5 in the blood
as compared with that of protein delivery. Therefore, gene delivery
is more clinically applicable than protein delivery. However,
clinical application of RK5 gene therapy still needs further
investigation.
In conclusion, we have designed and constructed a novel fusion
peptide RK5 that can inhibit both MMP activity and endothelial
cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, the fusion peptide is
able to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. It represents a new
generation of agents against tumor.
