BACKGROUND: The use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy in soft tissue sarcomas is controversial. This is a
report of long-term (5 years) follow-up in patients with high-grade, high-risk soft tissue sarcomas treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, preoperative radiotherapy (RT), and adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients with highgrade soft tissue sarcoma 8 cm in diameter of the extremities and body wall received 3 cycles of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine) and preoperative RT (44 grays administered in split
courses), and 3 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy (mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine). RESULTS:
Sixty-four of 66 patients were analyzed. After chemotherapy and RT, 61 patients had surgery; 58 had R0 resections
(5 amputations), and 3 had R1 resections. Ninety-seven percent experienced grade 3 or higher toxicity, including 3
deaths. These toxicities were short term. With a median follow-up of 7.7 years in surviving patients, the 5-year rates
of locoregional failure (including amputation), and distant metastasis were 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.832.6) and 28.1% (95% CI, 17.0-39.2). The most common site of metastasis was lung. Estimated 5-year rates of diseasefree survival, distant disease-free survival, and overall survival were 56.1% (95% CI, 43.9-68.3), 64.1% (95% CI, 52.375.8), and 71.2% (95% CI, 60.0-82.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the toxicity was significant, it was limited
in its course and for the most part resolved by 1 year. The long-term outcome was better than might be expected in

Management approaches for newly diagnosed primary sarcoma include wide local resection combined with preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy or wide local excision alone for small superficial lesions.1-6 Management in this manner results in control of local tumor in 80% to 95% of patients, and the majority of patients benefit with good extremity
function.7,8 Patients with high-grade tumors >5 cm are at increased risk for distant treatment failure and death from metastatic disease.8,9 The risk of distant metastatic disease increases with the size of the primary high-grade tumor. The risk is

34% in patients with lesions 5.1 to 10 cm and increases to
43% and 58% for 10.1- to 15-cm and 15.1- to 20-cm
lesions, respectively.8 A potential role for adjuvant chemotherapy in these high-risk tumors has been investigated. In
2006, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group published
the short-term results of a phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of a modified mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine regimen interdigitated with
radiotherapy in patients with high-risk, high-grade soft
tissue sarcomas of the extremities and torso 8 cm in
maximum diameter.10 The primary goal of this intervention was to decrease distant metastasis and improve survival in this high-risk group of patients. The initial results
from this trial showed this regimen to be associated with a
high rate of toxicity, but 1 that could nevertheless be delivered in a cancer cooperative group setting. The short-term
outcomes were consistent with the earlier institutional
pilot study.11 The early toxicity reported, 73% grade 4
leukopenia with 3 treatment-related deaths, compared
unfavorably with that reported by DeLaney et al from the
Massachusetts General Hospital using a similar regimen,
but with a 25% lower dose of ifosfamide.12 It was considered most likely that this toxicity was related to the higher
dose of ifosfamide used in RTOG 9514. Although the
early toxicity and outcome of this regimen have been
reported by Kraybill et al and DeLaney et al, the longterm toxicity and outcomes have not been reported.10,12
Whether the early very significant local and systemic toxicity is also associated with long-term toxicity and whether
any gain in local and systemic tumor control is maintained are important for planning future trials and the
potential use of a modified form of the regimen in those
trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RTOG 9514 was an Intergroup trial conducted by the
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Protocol eligibility requirements, treatment plans, study endpoints, and statistical
methods have been detailed previously.10 Briefly, eligible
patients had large (8 cm), high-grade (grade 2 or 3 in a
3-tier grading system) primary or locally recurrent soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities or torso clinically judged to
be amenable to an R0 resection on completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. For extremity lesions, a requirement for admission to the protocol
was that patients be deemed candidates for a limb salvage
procedure by the surgeon and the radiation oncologist.

4614

Resections were defined as R2 if the margins were macroscopically positive and with visible tumor left behind, R1
if all macroscopic disease was removed but with the margins microscopically positive, or R0 if margins were
microscopically negative. Protocol treatment was 3 cycles
of preoperative modified mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide,
and dacarbazine chemotherapy with 44 grays (Gy) of radiation given in split courses of 22 Gy between the first and
second cycles and between the second and third cycles,
followed by surgery and 3 cycles of postoperative mesna,
doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine. Rates of locoregional failure and distant metastases were estimated using
the method of cumulative incidence.13 Amputation for
any indication was considered locoregional failure because
of the protocol’s aim of achieving limb preservation. Rates
of overall, disease-free, and distant disease-free survival
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.14 All efficacy endpoints were measured from the date of registration in the study.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
Toxicity Criteria version 1.0 was used for chemotherapy
toxicity, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
acute and late toxicity criteria were used to describe toxicity secondary to radiotherapy.15 The follow-up regimen
was designed to assess in detail both early and late toxicity.
The early regimen was designed to identify and record
expected toxicities from the combined chemotherapy and
radiation therapy regimen. After completion of therapy,
patients were followed at a minimum of every 3 months
for the first 2 years, every 6 months for years 2 through 5,
and yearly thereafter. These postoperative evaluations
included history and physical exam, blood work, and
imaging. The imaging consisted of computerized tomography (CT) of the chest and either magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or CT of the primary tumor site. Late
grade 2 to 4 toxicity rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years from
the start of radiation therapy were estimated using the
maximum grade reported for each toxicity type over 1year intervals around the time point of interest (ie, 6
months). This was done to avoid underestimation of the
toxicity rates. Although careful follow-up for long-term
complications was performed as described above, detailed
evaluation of post-treatment function was not done.

were ineligible (1 with metastatic disease and 1 with ineligible histology), leaving 64 patients for analysis. The data
that form the basis of this report represent all information
received and processed at Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group headquarters through July 25, 2007. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 7.7 years (range, 2.0-9.3
years), with all but 4 of the surviving patients having >5
years follow-up, compared with median 2.7 years for the
initial report. Pretreatment characteristics have been
detailed previously. Eighty percent were histologically
grade 3 (in a 3-tier grading system). The median tumor
size as measured by MRI, CT, or clinical finding was 15
cm (range, 8.2-55 cm).
Treatment Summary
Treatment delivery with respect to the protocol prescription has been summarized previously.10 Briefly, only 59%
of patients received all 6 cycles of mesna, doxorubicin,
ifosfamide, and dacarbazine chemotherapy, and 89%
received a preoperative radiation dose per protocol
(within 5%). Of 5 patients that received <95% of prescribed radiation, 3 had a local failure. However, 2 of
these stopped radiation because of failure. One had an
amputation, and 1 had progression. Local failures are not
thought to be secondary to inadequate radiation dose.
Open biopsy for diagnosis was used in 82%, core needle
biopsy in 15%, and aspiration cytology in 4%. Sixty-one
patients underwent resection in RTOG 9514, and 3
patients did not. Of these 3 patients, 2 had persistent and
progressive primary tumors and were not candidates for
R0 resections. The third patient’s primary was controlled;
however, he had progressive distant disease and refused
local resection. Fifty-eight (91%) patients had R0 resection (of which 5 were amputation), and the other 3 had
R1 resections. Simple wound closure was used in 47% of
patients, local muscle flaps in 13%, myocutaneous or
muscle flaps in 11%, some other method in 13%, and a
combination of reconstructive techniques was used in
16%.
Treatment Toxicity
The toxicity of this regimen, as previously reported, is
considerable. Three (5%) patients died of treatmentrelated causes, 2 of which were secondary to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which occurred at 28 and 29
months. Ninety-seven percent experienced grade 3 or
higher toxicities, including 3 grade 5 (death) toxicities.
These toxicities were, for the most part, acute and transitory (Table 1). At 1 year, 25% (15 of 59) of patients had 1

4616

or more grade 3 to 4 toxicities, but this rate was reduced
to 7% (4 of 58) at 2 years, 4% (2 of 47) at 3 years, 3% (1
of 37) at 4 years, and 3% (1 of 34) at 5 years. At 1 year,
19% (11 of 59) had grade 1 to 2 toxicity, which was
reduced to 6% (3 of 58) at 2 years, 2% (1 of 47) at 3 years,
3% (1 of 37) at 4 years, and 6% (2 of 34) at 5 years. The
toxicities at 5 years were grade 2 fracture in 1 patient,
grade 2 endocrine in 1 patient, and in a third patient grade
2 pain and grade 3 infection. Late grade 2 to 4 toxicities
by type at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years from the start of therapy
are summarized in Table 1. This table demonstrates the
severe acute toxicity and marked decrease in incidence
and severity of treatment-associated toxicity later in follow-up.
Five of 53 extremity sarcomas underwent amputation, for a 9.4% amputation rate. We considered 2 of
them to be treatment related, where the patients developed leukopenia-associated sepsis attributed to infection
at the biopsy site. Two other patients were thought to
have an inadequate clinical response to neoadjuvant treatment. One underwent a disarticulation, and the other
underwent Van Ness rotationplasty with a bone graft.
There was no viable tumor in either specimen. The fifth
patient with a high-grade leiomyosarcoma of the axilla
completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. On exploration of the axilla, the tumor was deemed
too close to the neurovascular bundle, and he underwent
forequarter resection. Pathology showed extensive necrosis with islands of viable tumor.
Survival and Pattern of Failure
At a median follow-up of 7.7 years (range, 2.0-9.3 years)
for 42 surviving patients, 35 (54.7%) patients were alive
without any disease failure (Fig. 1). Since the initial
report, there have been 3 additional locoregional failures
(for a total of 14), and 1 additional patient (1, lung) with
distant metastases (for a total of 19). There have been 2
newly reported (1, posterior neck sarcoma; 1, pancreatic
cancer) second primaries, for a total of 6 second primaries.
Two of these second primaries were AML and considered
a complication of chemotherapy. There have been 8 additional deaths from disease for a total of 22. The estimated
5-year locoregional failure and distant metastases rates are
22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.8-32.6) and
28.1% (95% CI, 17.0-39.2) (Fig. 1). If amputation is not
considered a locoregional failure, the 5-year locoregional
failure rate is 20.7%. Excluding amputations, local recurrences were managed with radiotherapy þ surgery
(n ¼ 3), surgery (n ¼ 1), chemotherapy (n ¼ 2), and no

treatment (n ¼ 3). The most common site of distant failure was the lung (16 of 19). There have been only 4
locoregional failures after 2 years and none after 5 years.
Only 2 patients have experienced distant metastases after
2 years, 1 of which was after 5 years. In total, 25 patients
have experienced locoregional failure and/or distant metastases. Of 42 patients still at risk for both failures at 2
years, only 3 subsequently failed (1 locoregional; 1 distant; 1 both). Of 36 patients still at risk for both failures at
5 years, only 1 subsequently failed (1 distant).
The estimated 5-year rate of second primaries is
9.7% (95% CI, 2.2-17.1). Again, 2 of these were AML.
The 5-year estimated rates of disease-free and distant disease-free survival are 56.1% (95% CI, 43.9-68.3) and
64.1% (95% CI, 52.3-75.8) (Fig. 2). The estimated 5year survival rate is 71.2% (95% CI, 60.0-82.5). Cause of
death was the study cancer in 15 patients, second primary
in 1 patient, protocol treatment in 3 patients (this
includes the 2 AML patients), and unknown in 3 patients.

DISCUSSION
RTOG 9514 was opened in 1997 to assess what appeared
at that time to be a promising regimen of adjuvant treatment for advanced primary soft tissue sarcomas of the
extremities and torso developed at the Massachusetts
General Hospital.11 As with the pilot, the study group was
selected because they had extraordinary risk for developing distant metastasis and dying of metastatic disease.8
Since RTOG 9514 was opened and began to accrue
patients, several other investigators have studied and

reported their outcomes in the management of high-risk
primary soft tissue sarcomas. These reports have not infrequently been contradictory in their results with regard to
toxicity and outcomes. Excellent results have been
reported with surgery alone in selected patients.5,16 Overall, factors identified as being important have included
margins 1 cm, compartmental resections, and tumors
amenable to wide resection despite being locally
advanced. However, most groups have concluded that
improved local control with limb salvage has more potential for success when wide excision is combined with either
preoperative or postoperative radiation in patients with
tumors >5 cm in diameter that are high grade17; furthermore, the use of radiation therapy may permit closer surgical margins18 while maintaining high rates of local
control, which may be important when wider resection
would compromise limb function.
There are 2 important randomized trials that are relevant. Yang and his coauthors from the NCI reported 141
patients with soft tissue sarcomas randomized between
surgical resection alone and resection with postoperative
radiation.19 This trial demonstrated improved local control in those patients receiving postoperative radiation. An
accompanying quality of life study showed a decrease in
joint motion and an increase in limb weakness and edema
in patients receiving postoperative radiation. The
National Cancer Institute of Canada randomized 190
patients to preoperative radiation (50 Gy in 25 fractions)
versus postoperative radiation (66 Gy in 33 fractions).20
In several publications from 2002 to 2004, this group

4617

reported comparable 5-year results for local control (93%
vs 92%); metastatic relapse-free survival (67% vs 69%),
recurrence-free survival (58% vs 59%), and overall survival (78% vs 73%) (P ¼ .64).21 However, preoperative
radiation was clearly associated with a higher incidence of
acute wound complications. An evaluation of radiationassociated morbidity in this series demonstrated that
patients treated with postoperative radiation tended to
have greater late fibrosis, joint stiffness, and edema that
adversely affected patient function.22 These trials both
support the use of radiation in combination with surgery
as a means to achieve limb salvage and local control of extremity tumors. Neither trial suggested that radiation
would enhance long-term survival or decrease distant metastasis. Both group’s cohorts of patients were at lower risk
than those managed in RTOG 9514.
The locoregional failure rate and the amputation
rate were higher in RTOG 9514 than might be expected.
Since the initial report, there have been 3 additional
locoregional failures (for a total of 14), with a locoregional
failure rate of 22.2%. Five of 53 extremity sarcomas
underwent amputation, for a 9.4% amputation rate.
Although a primary objective of the trial was to assess its
possible role in decreasing distant metastasis and in
enhancing survival, an important secondary goal was to
do so without compromising local control. What were
some of the factors influencing the local recurrence rate
and amputation rate? Patient selection may have had a
role. Although patients were admitted to the trial only
with the agreement of the surgical or orthopedic oncologist and the radiation oncologist, this was a cooperative
group trial involving 31 institutions. For tumors >8 cm
in maximum diameter, it is likely that committed investigators may differ in their experience and view of which of
these patients would be candidates for this trial. Also,
there were 2 patients judged at the time of surgery not to
be candidates for limb salvage and found to have no viable
tumor in the specimen after amputation. It is also likely
that surgeons would differ in their experience and view of
what is an acceptable margin after neoadjuvant therapy. It
is reasonable to suggest that these 2 factors in the selection
of patients for this protocol and the selection of the surgical procedure in the management of patients may have
resulted in decreased locoregional control and an
increased amputation rate. Another factor that almost certainly can effect outcome, both local control and distant
control, is the response to neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. Central review of the resected specimens demonstrated that some tumors clearly responded and some did

4618

not. In 14 of 51 assessable patients (27%), there was no
viable tumor identified.10 Three (6%) patients had
>75% viable tumor. The number of patients assessed for
viable tumor was inadequate to assess its importance statistically. Variation by patient in terms of response to
chemotherapy and radiation is common and may have
impacted outcome in this protocol. Furthermore, 2 of the
amputations occurred because of wound infections at the
tumor biopsy site in association with chemotherapyinduced leukopenia, a rare cause of amputation in most
series.
The 5-year estimated rates of disease-free and distant
disease-free survival, 56.1% and 64.1%, respectively, are
better than might be expected for tumors of this size and
grade (Fig. 2). The estimated 5-year survival rate was
71.2%. This compares favorably with historical controls
for tumors of this size and grade.8,23 In a series of patients
treated with a similar regimen but with a lower dose of
ifosfamide from the Massachusetts General Hospital, the
local control, disease-free, and distant disease-free survival
were 92%, 75%, and 70%, respectively.12 The estimated
5-year survival rate was 87%. There was significant early
toxicity in this trial as well, considered to be secondary to
the mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine
chemotherapy. However, it was not nearly as severe as
that in RTOG 9514. This difference is thought to be secondary to the increased ifosfamide dose given in RTOG
9514. Although it is difficult to compare single institution
results with those from cooperative groups, outcomes
noted above are also clearly better in the Massachusetts
General Hospital trial. This is possibly secondary to a
greater percentage of tumors in RTOG 9514 being grade
3 tumors (80% vs 50% in the Massachusetts General
Hospital trial) and the inclusion of a greater percentage of
truncal lesions in RTOG 9514. Also, the selection process
for the Massachusetts General Hospital trial is likely to be
more consistent than in RTOG 9514. Another trial
assessing preoperative chemotherapy concurrently with
radiation was that reported by Edmonson et al from the
Mayo Clinic.24 Thirty-nine patients received 2 cycles of
aggressive chemotherapy consisting of ifosfamide, mitomycin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. After 2 monthly cycles
of this regimen, radiation to a total dose of 45 Gy was
given concurrently with mitomycin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin. One month after completion of external beam
radiation these patients were resected with an additional
10 to 20 Gy of intraoperative or postoperative radiation
being given to the field after resection. These were all
grade 3 or 4 tumors and were large tumors, with 44%

being >10 cm in maximum diameter, although they were
probably smaller overall than those reported in RTOG
9514 and the Massachusetts General Hospital study. The
Kaplan-Meier estimate of 5-year survival was 80%. This
was also a toxic regimen, with grade 3 or greater toxicity
consisting of leukopenia (54%), thrombocytopenia
(77%), and infection (10%), principally neutropenic
fever. All 3 of these regimens consisting of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy given with radiation have been associated
with significant toxicity but have provided interesting
results in terms of disease-free survival, distant disease-free
survival, and overall survival. These outcomes are somewhat better than might be expected in locally advanced
high-grade soft tissue sarcomas. The estimated rate of distant metastasis for high-grade tumors of this size
approaches or exceeds 50%.8,23
These 3 phase 2 studies were developed to improve
the long-term outcomes in patients with extraordinarily
high-risk tumors, to decrease distant metastasis and
improve long-term survival. These 3 studies appear to
have better than expected long-term results in regard to
disease-free survival and distant disease-free survival.
Nedea et al updated the Massachusetts General Hospital
experience. Their report comparing neoadjuvant mesna,
doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine-treated patients
with historical matched high-risk controls treated with
radiation and surgery suggested improved outcomes with
neoadjuvant mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine.12,25 A careful review of the long-term complications and recurrences, both local and distant, is
important, as continuing complications occurring in
patients treated with this regimen could preclude consideration of its potential use in future protocols or in combination with other therapeutic interventions. The most
common late toxicity, defined as occurring at least 6
months after the initiation of radiation, was leukopenia,
with 8 patients still manifesting grade 4 toxicity. However, this was for the most part resolved after the first year.
The incidence of significant toxicity was markedly
decreased after 1 and almost completely after 2 years.
In a careful and thoughtful review of the potential
role of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin- and doxorubicin/ifosfamide-based regimens,
Bramwell presented her view that it is premature to routinely manage high-risk soft tissue sarcomas with adjuvant
or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.26 She based this view on
the toxicity reported from regimens being used such as in
RTOG 9514. She also emphasized that trials in breast
cancer and osteosarcoma assessing a potential advantage

with neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy failed to demonstrate a benefit in giving chemotherapy before other therapies.27,28 Conceptually, there
might be an advantage to starting chemotherapy before
other therapies to treat microscopic metastatic disease.
Published data in these tumors do not support this view.
Also, there was a relatively small benefit identified in a rigorously done meta-analysis (SMAC meta-analysis)
reported in 1997.29 In the SMAC meta-analysis, the original data sets were accessed, reviewed, and reanalyzed. A
more recent meta-analysis studying the role of adjuvant
chemotherapy used only the published results and a different statistical methodology. Trials were included that had
a minimum of 2 years follow-up.30 This trial includes the
addition of ifosfamide to the doxorubicin-based regimens.
This trial found statistical significance for survival, with a
46% risk of death in patients not receiving chemotherapy
versus 40% in patients receiving chemotherapy. This does
not resolve the issue of toxicity. On the basis of its extensive studies, the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer has concluded that adjuvant and/or
neoadjuvant chemotherapy should not be used outside a
clinical trial setting.31,32 The literature concerning the use
of adjuvant or neoadjuvant doxorubicin and/or doxorubicin/ifosfamide is interesting, but is inconclusive with
regard to toxicity and efficacy issues.
There have been reports of the use of adjuvant drug
therapies that are directed toward specific histopathologic
types of sarcomas. Eilber et al, combining sarcoma databases from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and
University of California at Los Angeles, reported that adjuvant ifosfamide was associated with improved diseasespecific survival for high-grade extremity liposarcomas.33
In a separate article, Eilber et al reported that adjuvant
ifosfamide was associated with improved survival in synovial sarcomas.34 Targeted therapies for soft tissue sarcomas are being investigated. Imatinib, very successful in
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, is being investigated as
potential therapy in other soft tissue sarcomas such as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, chordoma, and aggressive
fibromatosis.35 Insulinlike growth factor is being investigated as targeted therapy for pediatric sarcomas and adult
sarcomas.36 The specific histone deacetylase inhibitor
PCI-24,781 in combination with chemotherapy is being
investigated in sarcoma animal models.37
In summary, RTOG 9514 assessed a regimen of
very aggressive chemotherapy in combination with preoperative radiation as adjuvant therapy for uncommonly
high-risk extremity and torso soft tissue sarcomas.

Original Article

Although probably the highest-risk primary soft tissue sarcoma cohort assessed in the cooperative group setting, the
long-term outcomes were better than might be expected
for this group of high-risk tumors. Although the early toxicity was severe, this abated for the most part after 6
months and did not continue to any significant degree
beyond 1 year. Potential reasons for this toxicity have
been outlined. This regimen should not be used outside a
clinical trial setting, but in a modified form and possibly
in combination with other therapies might still be considered for study. Future adjuvant therapy regimens in this
group of tumors need to be less toxic and more efficacious. Efforts such as those of the RTOG 0630 seeking to
safely decrease radiation fields in the management of extremity soft tissue sarcomas may well decrease the local
toxicity of management of these tumors and facilitate
combination with systemic therapy. Identifying specific
tumor subtypes more responsive to specific chemotherapy
regimens and regimens combined with targeted therapies
may improve efficacy without increasing toxicity. Continued clinical and translational research directed toward
these fascinating tumors is required to improve outcomes
and decrease toxicity.
