Abstract
Tumor characteristics are decisive in the determination of treatment strategy for patients with breast cancer.
Patients with estrogen receptor a (ERa)–positive breast cancer can beneﬁt from long-term hormonal treatment.
Nonetheless, the majority of patients will develop resistance to these therapies. Here, we investigated the role of
the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) in antiestrogen-sensitive and -resistant breast
cancer cells. We identiﬁed genome-wide LRH-1–binding sites using ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing), uncovering preferential binding to regions distal to transcriptional start sites. We further
characterized these LRH-1–binding sites by integrating overlapping layers of speciﬁc chromatin marks, revealing
that many LRH-1–binding sites are active and could be involved in long-range enhancer–promoter looping.
Combined with transcriptome analysis of LRH-1–depleted cells, these results show that LRH-1 regulates speciﬁc
subsets of genes involved in cell proliferation in antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer
cells. Furthermore, the LRH-1 transcriptional program is highly associated with a signature of poor outcome and
high-grade breast cancer tumors in vivo. Herein, we report the genome-wide location and molecular function of
LRH-1 in breast cancer cells and reveal its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancers, notably for
tumors resistant to treatments currently used in therapies. Cancer Res; 74(7); 2015–25. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
During the last 40 years, antihormonal therapy targeting
estrogen receptor a (ERa) activity in breast cancer has allowed
both an increase in relapse-free survival and a 30% decrease in
mortality in the 15 years following treatment initiation (1, 2).
Long-term adjuvant treatments currently used following
tumor surgery consist in blocking estrogen action at the
receptor using tamoxifen or fulvestrant/ICI182780 (ICI), or
inhibiting estrogen biosynthesis using inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19 aka aromatase). Despite the
success of these endocrine therapies, nearly half of breast
cancers are, or will become, resistant to these treatments.
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain antiestrogen resistance, such as loss or change of ERa expression,
alteration in coregulator expression and/or activity, and aberrant growth factor signaling (2, 3). Endocrine resistance results
in uncontrolled proliferation and deregulation of the ERa
transcriptome, notably in genes involved in cell cycle and

apoptosis (3, 4). Recent technological advances in genomic
studies have enabled us to determine the chromatin structure
and epigenetic signatures that are liable for the aberrant
transcriptional program in antiestrogen resistance. For
instance, it has been shown that the pioneer factors Forkhead
box A1 protein (FOXA1) and pre–B-cell leukemia homeobox 1
(PBX1) inﬂuence global chromatin structure and guide ERa to
bind speciﬁc genes associated with poor clinical prognosis in
breast cancer (5–7). This suggests that a better understanding
of how these tumors acquire resistance at the epigenetic level is
an essential step in developing new strategies to bypass
endocrine resistance.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), also known as NR5A2, is a
member of the nuclear receptor family and binds DNA as a
monomer. Originally classiﬁed as an orphan nuclear receptor,
crystal structure analyses revealed the presence of a ligand in
the pocket of its ligand-binding domain. Several teams have
shown that natural phospholipid molecules, such as phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylcholine, are able to bind LRH-1 in
mammals, thereby modifying its transcriptional activity (8, 9).
The search of novel strategies to therapeutically target LRH-1
in a variety of pathologies have led to the development of
ligands with agonist activity (10) and molecules with inverse
agonist activity (11, 12).
LRH-1 regulates multiple essential physiologic functions,
particularly in embryonic development and differentiation,
fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism, bile acid and pancreatic
ﬂuid homeostasis and synthesis (13). In reproduction, LRH-1 is
a key regulator of ovulation (14) and placental function (15). It
has been reported that LRH-1 has an important role in the
development and progression of many cancers, such as colon,

gastric, pancreas, liver, and breast cancers (13). For example, it
has been shown that the grafting of pancreatic and hepatic
cancer cell lines overexpressing LRH-1 in athymic mice promotes cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor progression (16). These effects seem to be mediated by the targeting of
genes involved directly in cell proliferation such as CCNE1,
CCND1, and MYC (16, 17). In breast cancer, LRH-1 is highly
expressed and localized in the epithelial compartment of both
invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ (18, 19).
Interestingly, depletion of LRH-1 in breast cancer cells
decreases cell mobility, invasion and colony formation (20).
Moreover, an important crosstalk seems to exist in estrogendependent breast cancer cells, in which LRH-1 is itself regulated by ERa (18). The depletion of LRH-1 in these cells inhibits
the proliferative effect of estrogen, suggesting that the mitogenic effects of estrogen may be mediated, in part, by LRH-1.
Thus, although the molecular effects of LRH-1 in breast cancer
are not fully understood, much evidence suggests that its role is
closely integrated with the estrogen signaling pathway and cell
proliferation.
In the present study, we determined the cistrome and the
transcriptome of LRH-1 in human breast cancer cells. Many
LRH-1–binding sites correspond to active open chromatin
regions discernable by FAIRE signal (formaldehyde assisted
isolation of regulatory elements) and by the active transcription
enhancer mark H3K27ac. Some LRH-1–binding sites overlap
with Med12 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), known to be
speciﬁc marks for enhancers involved in long-range enhancer–
promoter looping. Furthermore, we provide evidence that LRH1 governs a transcriptional program essential for cell proliferation in antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant
breast cancer cells, in particular the regulation of CCND1,
through long-range enhancers, found 125 and 116 kb upstream
of its transcriptional start site (TSS). Importantly, LRH-1 transcriptional program is associated with poor outcome in breast
cancer. Together, these ﬁndings strongly suggest an implication
of LRH-1 in the development of resistance to antiestrogen
treatments and bring to light the potential of targeting LRH1 for the development of new breast cancer treatments.

Materials and Methods
Cell line, cell culture, and shRNA lentiviral transduction
MCF7 and HMEC cell lines (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Wisent) containing 10% FBS and antibiotics or in
HuMEC ready medium (Gibco). The MCF7/LCC2 and MCF7/
LCC9 cells (a gift from Robert Clarke, Georgetown University
Medical Center, Washington, DC) were cultured in DMEM
without phenol red containing 5% charcoal–dextran-treated
FBS. Cells were routinely tested for LRH-1 and ERa expression
by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot analyses. MCF7/
LCC2 and MCF7/LCC9 cells were routinely checked for resistance to antiestrogen by qPCR on ERa target genes (last test on
October 18, 2013) and by growth assays (last test on October 26,
2013). Cells routinely tested were found to be mycoplasma-free.
The short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) against LRH-1 (sequences
included in Supplementary Table S1) were purchased from

2016

Cancer Res; 74(7) April 1, 2014

Open Biosystems in the pLKO.1 vector. MCF7, MCF7/LCC2,
and MCF7/LCC9 were transduced with shRNA lentiviruses,
obtained as previously described (4), and collected for mRNA
and protein extraction after 4 days of transduction.
RNA, microarray, and protein analysis
Four days after LRH-1 knockdown, total RNA and protein
were collected from MCF7, LCC2, and LCC9 cells as previously
described (4). For qPCR and Western blot analysis, we used
primers and an antibody (listed in Supplementary Table S2 and
S3) that target all known LRH-1 variants. Microarray analysis
using BeadChip Human Genome (Illumina; HT-12) was performed at the Centre d'innovation at Genome Quebec (McGill
University, Montreal, QC, Canada). Log2 transformation and
quantile normalization of the data were performed and differentially expressed genes were selected using a P value cutoff
<0.05 and fold change >1.5. The open source software Cluster/Treeview was used to generate microarray heatmap
(http://www.eisenlab.org/eisen/).
Transcriptome-based outcome analysis
Genes differentially expressed following LRH-1 knockdown
(2-fold) were compared with poor outcome and high-grade
overexpressed gene signatures obtained from in vivo data using
Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.com). Clinical studies used
in the analysis are listed in Supplementary Table S8. Signiﬁcant
association was established at a P value of at least <0.01 and an
OR of >2.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation, FAIRE, and
sequencing
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were
performed as previously described (21). The antibodies and
primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S3 and S4.
FAIRE experiments were achieved as previously described (6).
ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) and
FAIRE-seq libraries were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Illumina) starting with 10 and 50 ng of
DNA, respectively. DNA was puriﬁed with solid phase reversible
immobilization beads (Agencourt AMPure XP; Beckman Coulter) and quantiﬁed with Bioanalyzer (Agilent) prior to be
sequenced using the Hi-seq (Illumina). Generated reads were
aligned to the human reference genome hg18 using BurrowsWheeler Aligner (22). Only sequence reads that were uniquely
mapped to the genome with a mapping quality score >10 were
used. Two biologic replicates were performed and merged for
subsequent analyses.
ChIP-seq data analysis and visualization
The peaks were called by Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq
(MACS; ref. 23) with default parameters. Genomic distributions
were determined using Cis-regulatory Element Annotation
(CEAS; ref. 24) and Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotation
tool (GREAT; ref. 25). Motif discovery was completed using
HOMER known and de novo motif (26). Nearby genes were
assigned to ChIP-seq peaks using GREAT and compared with
differentially expressed genes from microarray analysis. The
k-means linear clustering method was used to generate

heatmaps with seqMINER (27). LRH-1 clusters were intersected
with our own RNAPII ChIP-seq data and with RNAPII ChIA-PET
(chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing)
experiment (GSM832458 and GSM832459; ref. 28). Random
genomic regions with the same length, size, and genomic
distribution of LRH-1 clusters were used as control, and compared with RNAPII ChIP-seq and RNAPII ChIA-PET data. Gene
ontology (GO; biologic processes) analyses were performed using
GREAT. Aligned tags were converted to WIG ﬁles by F-Seq (29)
and visualized with an Integrative Genomics Viewer (30).
Cell proliferation assays
On day 1 after lentiviral transduction, cells were seeded
(1  104) in 48-well plates and treated with vehicle (EtOH),
tamoxifen 106 mol/L (Sigma-Aldrich), or ICI182780 107 mol/L
(Tocris Bioscience) every 3 days. At the indicated time, cell
counting was performed using TC20 Automated Cell Counter
(Bio-Rad). For cells treated with the LRH-1 inverse agonist
ML180 (a gift from Patrick Grifﬁn, The Scripps Research
Institute, Jupiter, FL), cell counting was completed according
to the manufacturer's protocol [CellTiter 96 AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS); Promega]. MCF7,
LCC2, and LCC9 cells were seeded (2  103 or 5  103) in
96-well plates and treated with ML180 at concentrations of 5
and 10 mmol/L during 6 days. Cell-cycle analysis was performed
as previously described (4).
GEO accession number
All genomic data have been submitted to GEO database
under accession number GSE54892: ChIP-seq data (GSE47027)
and expression proﬁling (GSE54891).

Results
LRH-1 regulates genes associated with poor outcome in
breast cancer
As described previously, LRH-1 has been shown to be
involved in breast cancer cell proliferation. However, its speciﬁc
transcriptional program had not yet been established. To
evaluate the LRH-1–dependent transcription program, we
investigated global gene expression in the MCF7, MCF7/LCC2
(LCC2), and MCF7/LCC9 (LCC9) cell lines, depleted or not of
LRH-1. In earlier studies, resistance to tamoxifen in LCC2 was
established through stepwise in vivo selection of parental MCF7
cells treated with tamoxifen, whereas LCC9 cells present a
cross-resistance to fulvestrant/ICI180782 and to tamoxifen
(31, 32). First, we determined the level of LRH-1 in these
endocrine-resistant cell lines that still expressed ERa (Supplementary Fig. S1). Surprisingly, LRH-1 was overexpressed in
antiestrogen-resistant cells at mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein levels
(Fig. 1B) compared with either the antiestrogen-sensitive MCF7
or to a noncancerous breast cell line (HMEC). We then depleted
LRH-1 in MCF7, LCC2, and LCC9 cells using a lentiviral-based
shRNA approach. The two constructs shLRH-1 #1 and #2
efﬁciently depleted (70%–90%) both mRNA (Fig. 1D) and
protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S2A), and were used in the
following experiments. Duplicate microarray analyses were
performed to identify genes differentially expressed upon

knockdown in the three different cell lines (Supplementary
Tables S5–S7). Notably, the proﬁle of the LRH-1 transcriptional
program displayed greater similarity between cell lines LCC2,
LCC9, and MCF7 (Fig. 1C). Indeed, 303 genes were similarly
downregulated and 310 upregulated in the three cell lines
following LRH-1 knockdown. These results were conﬁrmed by
qPCR in MCF7, LCC2, and LCC9 cells, in which cellular depletion of LRH-1 was found to signiﬁcantly affect the expression of
important genes involved in cellular proliferation such as BCL2,
MYC (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S2B). In support of these
results, MYC downregulation upon LRH-1 knockdown is consistent with previously published data on LRH-1 target genes
described in intestine and pancreatic cancer cells (16, 17).
To further evaluate the impact of LRH-1 in breast cancer cells,
genes differentially expressed in absence of LRH-1 in these three
cell lines were compared with in vivo breast cancer data using
Oncomine Concepts Map analysis (Compendia Bioscience).
Genes downregulated in LRH-1–depleted MCF7, LCC2, and
LCC9 cell lines were signiﬁcantly associated with the signatures
of genes overexpressed in poor outcome and high-grade tumors
in vivo (Fig. 1E). However, upregulated genes observed in
absence of LRH-1 in MCF7, LCC2, and LCC9 cell lines had no
association with overexpressed gene signatures. Taken together, these results suggest that LRH-1 plays a similar role in terms
of transcriptional regulation in antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells, positively regulating
genes associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.
Genome-wide identiﬁcation of LRH-1–binding sites in
breast cancer cells
To expand our understanding of the role of LRH-1 in breast
cancer, we performed ChIP with LRH-1 antibody followed by
next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in asynchronous MCF7
cells. As a result, we detected 7,014 LRH-1–binding sites using
MACS (23) in MCF7 ChIP-seq data. Peak distribution analysis
showed that the vast majority of the LRH-1–binding sites were
located in intragenic and distal intergenic region (Fig. 2A).
Indeed, slightly more than 50% of LRH-1–binding sites were
localized at distant regulatory elements (>50 kb) from the TSS,
whereas almost 40% were localized between 5 and 50 kb and
the remainder around the TSS (Fig. 2B). De novo motif analysis
of LRH-1–binding sites revealed the enrichment of a canonical
nuclear receptor half-site sequence (Fig. 2C). This result is
consistent with the known LRH-1 motif previously determined
in mouse embryonic stem cells by ChIP-seq analysis (33).
To examine the relationship between LRH-1 binding and
global gene expression differences observed in MCF7 LRH-1–
depleted cells, the LRH-1–binding regions were individually
assigned to a total of 5,636 human UCSC known genes using
GREAT (25). Genes that were differentially expressed when
LRH-1 was depleted were signiﬁcantly associated with genes
bound by LRH-1 compared with random peaks (P < 1.85 
106; Fig. 2D). We conﬁrmed these results by ChIP–qPCR on
selected genes affected by the depletion of LRH-1 in MCF7 cells
such as MYC, BCL2, and IL24 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken
together, our results suggest that LRH-1 regulates a speciﬁc
transcriptional program primarily through the binding of
distal enhancer sites in breast cancer cells.

Chromatin pattern associated with LRH-1–binding
events
To further deﬁne the chromatin environment of LRH-1–
binding sites and to better understand how LRH-1 acts on its
target genes across the genome, we performed ChIP-seq
experiments identifying speciﬁc chromatin and transcriptional marks in MCF7 cells. FAIRE-seq and histone mark H3K27ac
ChIP-seq were carried out to identify regulatory elements
characterized by open chromatin (34) and separate active
enhancers from poised or nonactive enhancers (35). FAIRE
and H3K27ac signal were aligned on LRH-1–binding sites and
divided into high and low signal intensity (Fig. 3A, left). The
aggregate proﬁles of the high and low clusters are also shown
in Fig. 3A, right.
Med12, a component of the large mediator transcriptional
adaptor complex, was recently showed to mediate enhancer–
promoter looping and to interact directly with nuclear receptor (36, 37). The cluster corresponding to active LRH-1–binding
sites (FAIREhigh_H3K27achigh), was subdivided into high,
medium, and low signal according to our Med12 signal gen-

erated by ChIP-seq in the same cells (Fig. 3B). As expected, the
inactive LRH-1 cluster (FAIRElow_H3K27aclow) showed an
overall lower Med12 enrichment (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
These results suggest that active LRH-1–binding sites, which
are strongly associated with Med12, are involved in enhancer–
promoter looping.
To demonstrate the involvement of LRH-1 in long-range
chromatin interactions, we ﬁrst compared our LRH-1 clusters
with RNAPII-binding sites generated by ChIP-seq in the same
cells. RNAPII binds distal genomic regions with active enhancer signatures and genomic loci involved in chromatin looping
(28, 38, 39). Our results showed that 26% of the active LRH-1–
binding sites overlap with RNAPII-binding sites, whereas only
5% of the inactive LRH-1–binding sites are enriched for RNAPII
(Fig. 4A). As expected, this proportion increased to 41% of the
active LRH-1 subgroup with the highest Med12 enrichment
(Fig. 4A), whereas the inactive LRH-1 weakly overlapped with
RNAPII (less than 15%; Supplementary Fig. S4B).
ChIA-PET was developed to explore the three-dimensional
chromatin interactions involving speciﬁc protein factors at a

LRH-1 controls cell proliferation in antiestrogensensitive and antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells
To further annotate and assign potential function to LRH-1–
bound DNA regions, GREAT, and GO analyses were performed
on ChIP-seq dataset. GO analysis showed a strong correlation
with cell proliferation processes for the active LRH-1–binding
sites when compared with the inactive LRH-1–binding sites
(Fig. 5A). Indeed, the active LRH-1–binding sites displayed
strong enrichment with GO terms involved in cellular growth,
such as the regulation of cell-matrix adhesion, gland morphogenesis, and mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation and
development. Given the propensity for the occurrence of GO
terms involved in cell growth, we next wanted to test the
impact of LRH-1 depletion on proliferation and cell-cycle
distribution in MCF7, LCC2, and LCC9 cells. Using the
shLRH-1 #1 and shLRH-1 #2 constructs, we observed a strong

genome-wide level. Using the RNAPII ChIA-PET data (28), we
found that a little more than 60% of the active LRH-1–binding
sites and only 28% of the inactive LRH-1–binding sites were
associated with RNAPII DNA looping (Fig. 4B). As expected,
this proportion increased to almost 80% for the active LRH-1–
binding sites with the highest Med12 enrichment (Fig. 4B).
Supporting these results, we found that many genes affected by
the depletion of LRH-1 and showing an important enrichment
of LRH-1 (Supplementary Fig. S3) were involved in a long-range
interacting conﬁguration between the LRH-1–binding regions
and the surrounding promoter (Supplementary Fig. S5–S6).
Interestingly, this conﬁguration was present on genes important in cell proliferation and breast cancer progression such as
BCL2 and MYC (Supplementary Fig. S5). Collectively, these data
provide further support that LRH-1 regulates its transcriptional program by binding preferentially at enhancer elements that
interact with their corresponding promoter.

reduction in cell proliferation over a period of 9 days following
lentiviral infection (Fig. 5B). MCF7 cells, which are sensitive to
antiestrogen treatment such as tamoxifen or ICI, showed a very
slow or arrested growth after LRH-1 knockdown. Moreover,
LCC2 and LCC9 cell lines showed a complete growth inhibition
when treated with LRH-1 shRNA while they are nonresponsive
to tamoxifen and/or ICI treatment. To further characterize the
arrested growth, we performed analysis of the cell-cycle distribution by ﬂuorescent-activated cell sorting. MCF7, LCC2,
and LCC9 cells showed an approximately 20% increase in G1
-phase, increasing from 60% to 65% in shCTL to 80% to 90% in
shLRH-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A). To assess the potential use of LRH-1 inhibitors to overcome antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer, we treated cells with the LRH-1 inverse
agonist ML180 (11) and measured cell proliferation over a
period of 6 days. As observed in LRH-1 knockdown experiments (Fig. 5B), treatment with the ML180 compound significantly reduced the growth of MCF7 cells and, importantly, the
LRH-1 inverse agonist had a stronger antiproliferative effect on
antiestrogen-resistant cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7B). We
observed a dose-dependent reduction in cell proliferation of up
to 30% in LCC2 and 60% in LCC9 cells after 6 days of treatment,
whereas a reduction of 15% to 30% in cell proliferation was
achieved for MCF7 cells. Taken together, these data show that
perturbation of the transcriptional program of LRH-1 by
repressing its expression/activity negatively affects cell proliferation, notably in antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells,
which fail to respond to current breast cancer therapeutic
treatments.
LRH-1 regulates CCND1 expression by distal enhancers
The gene encoding cyclin D1, CCND1, is very important for
the G1–S transition during cell cycle. Overexpression, ampliﬁcation, and mutations of this gene are often observed in

ChIA-PET RNAPII data showed that these distal sites are
involved in long-range interaction, notably by looping with

validated by ChIP–qPCR at these distal enhancers in MCF7,
LCC2, and LCC9 breast cancer cells (Fig. 6C). Altogether, these
results suggest that LRH-1 regulates CCND1 transcription
through distal enhancer in antiestrogen-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells.

Discussion
Previous studies have allowed the emergence of the understanding of the physiologic and pathologic functions of LRH-1.
In this study, we provide genomic evidence that LRH-1 plays a
critical role in breast cancer cell proliferation and demonstrate
a new role of this receptor in the acquisition of antiestrogen
resistance.
Using ChIP-seq, we mapped LRH-1–binding sites across the
genome and showed that LRH-1 preferentially binds at distal
regulatory element from TSS of target genes. A similar pattern

of LRH-1 distribution has been observed in mouse pancreas
ChIP-seq analysis (40). These results are also consistent with
previously published nuclear receptor cistrome analyses showing a preferential binding of LRH-1 to introns and distal
intergenic regions (41). Epigenetic modiﬁcations, such as
histone posttranslational modiﬁcations, are essential to deﬁne
active and inactive chromatin regulatory elements (35, 42, 43).
Close to 40% of LRH-1–binding sites are marked by FAIRE and
H3K27ac signals, which are speciﬁc markers of open and active
chromatin regions. These chromatin features strongly delineate genome-wide LRH-1–responsive elements, the LRH-1
cistrome, which clearly corresponds to breast cancer pathophysiology and cellular proliferation as shown by GO analysis.
In mouse stem cells, genes bound by LRH-1 are strongly

associated with embryonic development and pluripotency
maintenance (33), whereas in pancreas and liver, its transcriptional program is linked to glucose and lipid metabolism (40, 44). Our GO results are consistent with previous
studies showing a role for LRH-1 in cell proliferation, notably
targeting CCND1 and MYC, and support the hypothesis that
the genome-wide–binding pattern of LRH-1 is cell speciﬁc.
Furthermore, many of LRH-1–binding sites overlap with
Med12 and RNAPII binding, suggesting that they could be
involved in long-range interaction. Indeed, many LRH-1–
bound regions overlap with RNAPII–ChIA-PET interactions,
showing that distal LRH-1–binding sites are involved in
enhancer–promoter looping. Similar observations were
made in ERa ChIA-PET experiments revealing interactions

LRH-1 and Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancer

between intergenic ERa-binding sites and respective target
gene promoters (45, 46).
Interestingly, genes regulated by LRH-1 signiﬁcantly correlate
with genes overexpressed in breast cancer tumor and associated
with poor clinical prognosis. We have obtained similar observations with the transcriptional program of LRH-1–depleted cell
lines LCC2 and LCC9. Remarkably, antiestrogen-resistant LCC2
and LCC9 cell lines derived from parental MCF7 cells overexpressed LRH-1. Depletion of LRH-1 in these cells showed that
LRH-1 regulates gene subsets similar to those we reported in
MCF7 cells. Important regulators of cell proliferation, CCND1,
MYC, and BLC2, are often overexpressed in antiestrogen-resistant breast tumor (3) and were downregulated in our antiestrogen-resistant cell models following LRH-1 depletion. These
observations corroborate our results showing a decrease of cell
proliferation in antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells after LRH-1 knockdown.
LRH-1 plays a direct role in tumor development and progression via a positive feedback loop with ERa. Indeed, LRH-1
expression is regulated by ERa (18) and ERa is also regulated
by LRH-1 (47) because LRH-1 directly binds the ERa promoter
and vice versa. In addition, LRH-1 was shown to cooperate with
ERa to regulate estrogen-responsive genes such as GREB1 and
TFF1 (48). We also observed this cooperation because we found
an overlap of approximately 30% between the LRH-1 and ERa
cistromes in MCF7 cells (unpublished data). This result suggests that for some genes, LRH-1 and ERa may act together to
control gene expression. The overlap between LRH-1– and
ERa–binding sites provide a reasonable molecular basis for the
effects observed when blocking LRH-1 expression in antiestrogen-sensitive and -resistant cells. Further work will be
required to establish the mechanism responsible for this
cooperation. Despite this close link between LRH-1 and ERa,
it was also found that LRH-1 is expressed in ERa-negative
breast cancer cells in which it controlled cell migration and
invasion (20, 49), suggesting that LRH-1 may also have an
important role in hormone-independent cancers.
The G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) was shown to be
involved in activation of LRH-1 via stimulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathways in endometrial cancers (50). GPR30 signaling contributes to tumor growth and resistance to antiestrogen in
breast cancers (51). Furthermore, GPR30 cooperates with
EGFR/HER2, a gene known to be overexpressed in endocrine-resistant breast cancer, to mediate signaling pathway
activation and cell proliferation (52, 53).
LRH-1 may also act on breast cancer via an indirect mechanism such as the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, LRH-1

induces aromatase expression, the essential enzyme required
for the conversion of androgens to estrogens in breast adipose
tissues, acting in a paracrine manner on neighboring tumor
cells (54).
Together, our ﬁndings underpin an important role in the
acquisition of antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer with LRH1 acting as a key factor in central signaling pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of targeting
LRH-1 using an inverse agonist ligand, which signiﬁcantly
decreased cell proliferation in antiestrogen-resistant cells.
In summary, LRH-1 regulates a speciﬁc transcriptional program substantially involved in cell proliferation in antiestrogensensitive but also and especially in antiestrogen-resistant breast
cancer cells. A better understanding of LRH-1 action and the use
of small-molecule inhibitors with high speciﬁcity and afﬁnity for
this receptor may provide an alternate prognostic marker or
breast cancer treatment, a particularly attractive prospect for
tumors resistant to endocrine therapy.
