ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs function as oncomiRs and tumor suppressors in diverse cancers.
However, the utility of specific microRNAs in predicting the clinical benefit of
chemotherapy has not been well-established. Here, we investigated the correlation
between microRNA-21 expression and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with
5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin (HAIC) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found
that HCC patients with low microRNA-21 levels in tumors tended to have a longer
time to recurrence and disease-free survival. We demonstrated that microRNA-21
suppression in combination with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin treatment inhibited
tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft mice models. Mechanistically, the AP-1 and
microRNA-21-mediated axis was verified to be a therapeutic target of cytotoxic drugs
and deregulation of this axis led to an enhanced cell growth in HCC. Taken together,
our findings demonstrate that microRNA-21 is a chemotherapy responsive microRNA
and can serve as a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients undergoing HAIC. Targeting
microRNA-21 enhances the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby suggesting
that microRNA-21 suppression in combination with HAIC may be a novel approach
for HCC treatment.

INTRODUCTION

HCC patients still have a high rate of recurrence due to
local invasion and intrahepatic metastasis, even after
curative therapy [4]. The prognosis of patients with
advanced HCC, where the tumor has spread across the
liver or has invaded major vessels, remains extremely
poor [4-5]. In these patients, conventional therapies
using cytotoxic agents or novel targeted drugs have little

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver
cancer, the sixth most common cancer, and the third
leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1-3].
Several effective biomarkers and new imaging techniques
have enabled HCC detection at an early stage. However,

complications [6]. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy
(HAIC) has several theoretical advantages such as a
higher concentration of drugs delivered directly to the
tumor and reduced systemic toxicity [7]. However, an
optimal protocol of HAIC has not been established for
HCC [8]. Therefore, it is imperative to identify useful
biomarkers to predict the HCC clinical response to HAIC;
these biomarkers might provide novel avenues of HAIC
research and aid the early diagnosis and treatment of this
highly malignant tumor.
Increasing knowledge of the tumor biology of
HCC has elucidated a few coding and non-coding genes
involved in hepatocarcinogenesis [9-12]. Although the
fact that some of these deregulated genes have been
validated as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, little is
known regarding whether they can be potential predictors
for HAIC. Previous studies have indicated that microRNA
(miRNA) expression profiles or signatures can serve as
diagnosis tools and predictors for diverse cancers [1316], and some of these deregulated miRNAs have been
validated as oncomiRs or tumor suppressive miRNAs
(ts-miRs) in hepatic tumorigenesis[17-18]. For example,
miR-122, a specific miRNA in the liver, is downregulated
in HCC tissues and acts as a ts-miR through negatively
regulating cyclin G1 [19-20]. Various reports focusing
on miR-21 have indicated a crucial role for this oncomiR
in hepatocarcinogenesis [21-22] and demonstrate the
extensive association of miR-21 with HCC prognosis
and therapy [23-24]. Similarly, we have previously
revealed that miR-21 functions as an oncomiR through
suppressing the expression of PTEN, PDCD4, and RECK
[21]. These findings imply that miR-21 is a candidate for
HCC prognosis and therapy. However, several questions
remain unanswered. For example, the correlation between
miR-21 expression and the clinicopathological variables in
HCC patients is unknown, and it is also unclear whether
deregulated miR-21 expression in HCC is a response
to HAIC. Chemotherapeutic drugs exert suppressive
effects on HCC progression through regulating miR-21
expression.
Herein, we indentify miR-21 as a potential
biomarker for predicting HAIC effects. we further
demonstrate that chemotherapeutic drugs have clinical
promise for HCC therapy through modulating a critical
genetic pathway involving an miR-21-mediated program.

survival [8, 25]. Because miR-21 has been validated
as an oncomiR in hepatocarcinogenesis that leads to
drug resistance [21, 24, 26], we investigated whether its
expression responded to HAIC treatment. In doing so,
qRT-PCR analysis was conducted to evaluate miR-21
levels in 148 paired HCC samples, which indicated that
miR-21 expression were upregulated in the majority of
HCC specimens compared with the matched normal
liver tissues (Figure. 1A, Figure. S1A). These data are
consistent with our previous findings in 30 paired HCC
tissues [21]. In-depth clinicopathological analysis was
conducted on 109 patients with detailed information
selected from the aforementioned HCC tissues, which
showed that high miR-21 levels correlated with a more
aggressive tumor phenotype (P<0.001) and more extensive
invasion (P=0.03) (Figure. S1B-C; Supplementary Table
1). The relationship between miR-21 expression and
variable pathological grade was also determined, and no
significant differences among well, moderate, and poorly
differentiated HCC tissues were found (Figure. S1D).
A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that lower miR-21
levels were associated with longer disease-free survival
(DFS) (P=0.004; Figure. S1E; Supplementary Table 2).
Furthermore, we chose 67 HCC patients undergoing HAIC
with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin and conducted followup studies. These patients were divided into two groups
based on recurrence in the 3 years after treatment. We
observed that miR-21 expression was substantially higher
in the tissues of HCC patients who recurred compared with
those without recurrence (Figure. 1B). The Kaplan-Meier
method also indicated that HCC patients with low miR-21
levels in tumors tended to have a longer DFS compared
with those with high miRNA-21 expression, although the
difference did not reach significance (P=0.055; Figure.
1C-i). We further conducted Kaplan-Meier analyses
on patients with early stage HCC (pTNM stage I) and
observed that higher miR-21 levels correlated with shorter
DFS in early-stage HCC patients after HAIC (P=0.033;
Figure. 1C-ii). No significant difference between miR-21low and miR-21-high groups in HCC patients was found
at advanced stages (pTNM stage II, III, and IV; P=0.511;
Figure. 1C-iii). These findings suggest that HCC patients
with lower miR-21 expression levels in tumors have a
better response to HAIC treatment, especially at the early
stages.

miR-21 expression is suppressed by 5-fluorouracil
and pirarubicin in HCC cells

Hep3b cells by using a lentiviral system (Lenti-miR-21-i)
(Figure. S2A-C) and the subcutaneous xenografts were
generated through inoculating the Hep3b cells infected
with Lenti-miR-21-i and Lenti-scr, respectively. When the
tumor reached a volume of about 100 mm3, chemotherapy
was started and the tumor size and body weight were
determined twice a week during treatment. We observed
that miR-21 inhibition combined with 5-fluorouracil
and pirarubicin treatment exerted a dramatically
suppressive effect on the tumorigenicity of Hep3b cells
in vivo, as compared to all other experimental groups
(Figure. 2A-B; Figure. S2D). Moreover, we performed
immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of Ki67 in randomly selected xenograft mouse tumors, which
demonstrated that the above treatment retarded HCC cell
growth (Figure. 2C). These results supported our findings
in HCC patients who receiving HIAC prevention with
5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin.

Based on the fact that HCC patients with low
miR-21 levels in tumors had a better response to HAIC
treatment with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin, we asked
whether these two drugs offered a clinical benefit via
down-regulating miR-21 expression. To this aim, we first
evaluated the expression of miR-21 in several HCC cell
lines using qRT-PCR (Figure. 3A), and the IC50 values
of these drugs in Hep3b (miR-21-high) and SMMC7721
(miR-21-low) cells were determined. The estimated IC50
values for 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin in the tested cell
lines were as follows: Hep3b, 5-fluorouracil, 267.96 mg/L;
and SMMC7721, 5-fluorouracil, 131.38 mg/L; Hep3b,
pirarubicin, 1.65 mg/L; SMMC7721, pirarubicin, 0.25
mg/L (Figure. S3A-B). Next, Hep3b and SMMC7721 cells

miR-21 downregulation through AP-1 proteins

were treated with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin, and qRTPCR analyses were performed. We observed that drugs
treatment led to a significant decrease in miR-21 levels
in the tested HCC cells compared with those treated with
physiological saline (control) (Figure. 3B-C). We further
investigated whether 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin exerted
their suppressive effect on miR-21 expression at the
transcriptional level. qRT-PCR analyses were performed to
evaluate the level of primary miR-21 (pri-miR-21) using
three paired primers (up, cross, and down primers), which
indicated a significant decrease in pri-miR-21 expression
in 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin treated Hep3b and
SMMC7721 cells (Figure. 3D).

Previous studies have demonstrated that the AP-1
transcription factor family is involved in regulating miR21 expression [27-28]. Thus, we investigated whether
the expression of AP-1 components was affected by
5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin. First, we tested the mRNA
levels of c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos using qRT-PCR analyses.
Compared with control-treated cells, we observed that
the expression of JunB and c-Fos was downregulated
in 5-fluorouracil- and pirarubicin-treated HCC cells,
and no obvious alteration in c-Jun mRNA levels was
noticed (Figure. 4A-C). Further immunoblot analyses

demonstrated similar results for the protein levels of
JunB and c-Fos (Figure. 4D-i). Interestingly, we observed
a marked decrease of p-c-Jun in HCC cells treated with
5-fluorouracil, but no significant change was found in
c-Jun protein levels (Figure. 4D-ii). Similar results were
found in pirarubicin treated HCC cells (Figure. 4E).
Moreover, we evaluated the correlation between AP-1
components and miR-21 in HCC specimens. To this aim,
4 HCC specimens (miR-21-high, 2; miR-21-low, 2) were
selected to determine the expression of miR-21 and AP-1
proteins. The analysis revealed that the HCC tissues with
augmented AP-1 levels had increased miR-21 expression

(Figure. 4F; Figure. S4A). Further immunohistochemical
analysis was performed in the same tissue pairs, and AP-1
staining was also increased in HCC tissues with high miR21 levels compared with the matched normal liver tissues
(Figure. 4G; Figure. S4B).
Altogether, these data provide the evidence that
5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin have clinical benefits
through modulating the AP-1/miR-21 axis in HCC.

5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin suppress HCC
cell growth via regulating the miR-21-mediated
program

Drug-modulating oncomiRs or ts-miRs represent
crucial mechanisms for HCC chemotherapy
The above findings prompted us to further
investigate the effect of 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin
on other deregulated miRNAs validated in HCC. Hep3b
and SMMC7721 cells were treated with these two drugs,
and qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression
of selected oncomiRs and ts-miRs. After 5-fluorouracil
and pirarubicin treatment, most ts-miRs were upregulated
in HCC cells (17/18), and approximately 50% of the test
oncomiRs were downregulated (8/16; Figure. 6A and
Figure. S5). Importantly, miR-376a-P85α and miR-122aBcl-w[29-30], which have been validated as deregulated
axes in HCC cells, were modified after 5-fluorouracil
and pirarubicin treatment, as shown by using qRT-PCR
(Figure. 6B-C) and immunoblot analyses (Figure. 6D).
These data suggested that miRNA-mediated programs
modified by cytotoxic drugs may represent a global
mechanism for HCC chemotherapy activity. In addition,
the expression levels of several oncomiRs such as
miR-205 and miR-221 were significantly induced by
5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin treatment (Figure. S6),
which might lead to chemoresistance in HCC.
Taken together, our findings suggest that multiple
carcinogenesis-related programs, including oncomiR- or
ts-miR-mediated axes, are involved in the HCC response
to chemotherapy.

Because an miR-21-mediated PTEN/PDCD4/RECK
program has been identified in HepG2 and SMMC7721
HCC cells, we next investigated whether this program was
modified by 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin treatment. The
correlation between miR-21 and their targets was further
validated in Hep3b cells, indicating that PTEN, PDCD4,
and RECK were direct effectors of miR-21 in this cell line
(Figure. 5A). We next conducted immunoblot analyses to
evaluate the protein levels of PTEN, PDCD4, and RECK
in Hep3b and SMMC7721 cells after 5-fluorouracil and
pirarubicin treatment and we showed that the tested drugs
increased the levels of these proteins, as compared to
control-treated cells (Figure. 5B). To further probe the
correlation between cell phenotypic alterations and drugsmediated AP-1/miR-21 axis, we performed a rescue assay
that increased and then decreased the level of miR-21
targets via drugs treatment in combination with miR21 overexpression in HCC cells. Immunoblotting was
used to evaluate PTEN, PDCD4, and RECK expression
and demonstrated that the level of these proteins was
altered under different treatment conditions in Hep3b and
SMMC7721 cells (Figure. 5C). Furthermore, cell growth
analysis was conducted to determine the alterations in
cell viability corresponding with the expression level
variations of targeted proteins, and we observed that
miR-21 overexpression prevent the suppressive impact of
5-fluorouracil (Figure. 5D-i) and pirarubicin (Figure. 5Dii) treatment on HCC cell growth.
To further characterize the related genetic pathway
affected by 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin involving the
miR-21-mediated program in HCC cells, we examined the
associated target genes including p-AKT, AKT, p-GSK3β,
GSK3β, cyclin D1, cyclin E1, CDK2, and CDK4.
Immunoblots were used to analyze the protein expression
of these genes in Hep3b and SMMC7721 cells following
5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin treatment. A decrease in
p-AKT and p-GSK3β was noted in HCC cells treated
with 5-fluorouracil compared with control-treated cells.
However, no significant change was observed in total AKT
and GSK3β levels. We also observed that cyclin D1, cyclin
E1, CDK2, and CDK4 protein levels were decreased in
5-fluorouracil-treated HCC cells (Figure. 5E-i). Similar
results were noted in HCC cells with pirarubicin treatment
(Figure. 5E-ii).
Collectively, these findings indicate that
chemotherapy has a clinical benefit against HCC through
modifying the AP-1/miR-21-mediated axis (Figure. 5F).

DISCUSSION
Increasing evidence clearly demonstrate that
miR-21 not only is a crucial tumor promoter in hepatic
tumorigenesis but also functions as a prognostic factor
in HCC patients[21-22, 31]. Recent studies have also
revealed the prognostic value of circulating miRNAs
for detecting cancer[32]. For example, circulating miR21 serves as a biomarker for HCC diagnosis [23, 33].
However, the link between deregulated miR-21 and the
prognosis of HCC patients undergoing HAIC has not
been established. Here, we indicated that patients with
higher miR-21 expression in tumors tended to relapse,
which implied the prognostic significance of miR-21 for
predicting the clinical benefit of HAIC with 5-fluorouracil
and pirarubicin for HCC treatment. We also showed that
HCC patients with a longer DFS tended to express lower
miR-21 levels in tumors, albeit not to a significant degree
(P=0.055). The different clinical stages of the patients
may contribute to this finding. Thus, HCC patients were
divided into 2 groups, namely, early stage (pTNM I) and
advanced stage (pTNM II-IV), based on our correlation
analysis between miR-21 expression and pTNM stage.
We observed that HCC patients at an early stage with
lower miR-21 expression levels had a longer DFS after
5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin treatment via HAIC. We

MATERIALS AND METHODS

further generated subcutaneous xenografts by inoculating
Hep3b cells with or without miR-21 inhibition to evaluate
the antitumor effect of 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin
treatment in vivo, which indicated that miR-21 suppression
in combination with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin
treatment markedly inhibited HCC xenograft growth.
AP-1 activation plays a major role in tumor
promotion and progression via regulating the expression of
several oncogenes, which suggest that this transcriptional
factors family might serve as a potential target for tumor
therapy[34]. Several small molecular extracted from plant
offer chemopreventive effects on tumorigenesis through
inhibiting AP-1 activation, supporting this idea[35].
However, AP-1 is composed of a mixture of homo- and
heterodimers of Jun and Fos proteins, which results in
a complex phenotypic alteration of cells via regulating
different target genes[36]. For example, ectopic expression
of GADD153, which is also a putative target gene of AP1, increases the sensitivity of MKN45 gastric cancer
cells to VP-16, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel,
indicating that augmented GADD153 expression and AP-1
binding activity promote apoptosis induced by anticancer
drugs[37]. In the present study, we demonstrated that
5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin offered chemopreventive
effects via inhibiting AP-1 activation, thereby leading
to a modification of miR-21-mediated program in HCC
cells. Our data suggest that the AP-1 pathway is a good
target not only for the prevention but also for the therapy
of HCC.
Cisplatin is another cytotoxic drugs widely used
in HAIC for HCC treatment. We also investigated
whether cisplatin exerted its suppressive effects on
HCC cells via inhibiting miR-21 expression. Although
several reports indicate that miR-21 inhibition lead to
an improvement of cisplatin sensitivity[38-39], our
qRT-PCR analysis revealed that cisplatin treated-Hep3b
and SMMC7721 cells depicted no significant change
in miR-21 levels (Figure. S7). These data suggest that
the affected genetic pathways of cisplatin might be
different with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin. We further
conducted cisplatin treatment in HCC cells and performed
expression analyses of some oncomiRs and ts-miRs tested
in 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin treatment. A different
miRNA expression profile was observed in cisplatin
treated cells compared with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin
treatment (Figure. 6E-F). These findings represent a global
mechanism for chemotherapy achieving clinical promise
for HCC prevention through regulating miRNA-mediated
axes but drugs may offer their effects through different
genetic pathways.
Taken together, our findings indicate that HAIC
prevention using 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin has clinical
promise for HCC patients through modulating the AP-1
and miR-21 axis. miR-21 could function as a potential
biomarker for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients
receiving HAIC treatment.

Human Liver Tissues and Cell Lines
This study was approved by the ethical board
of the Peking Union Medical College hospital and the
ethical board of the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and all samples
were obtained with patients′ informed consent. Paired
samples of tumor/non-tumor liver tissues were collected
from patients undergoing HCC surgery, immediately snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction. The patient characteristics are provided in
Supplementary Table 1. Follow-up studies were performed
on 67 HCC patients who underwent HAIC. The total RNA
pool of normal liver samples comprised RNA from at least
3 donors, and the information for each healthy donor,
including the age, sex, race, cause of death, and diagnosis,
was obtained from Ambion Inc.
HCC cell lines, Hep3b, and SMMC7721 were
purchased from the Shanghai Cell Bank, Chinese Academy
of Sciences and cultured under standard conditions.

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis
Total RNA was extracted from cells and tissues
using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer′s instruction. The RNA was quantified
by absorbance at 260 nm. To assess the levels of miR-21,
qRT-PCR analysis was conducted by using Taqman probes
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Bio-Rad IQ5 qRTPCR system according to the manufacturer′s instruction.
The data were normalized using endogenous U6 snRNA.
The expression levels of miRNAs in cancer relative to
its non-tumorous control and HCC cells were calculated
using the equation 2-ΔΔCT in which ΔCT=CT 21-CT U6. The
value of the relative expression ratio <1.0 was considered
as low expression in cancer relative to the non-tumorous
control, where others were considered as high expression.

in tested HCC cells, qRT-PCR analysis was conducted by
using Taqman probes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
in the Bio-Rad IQ5 qRT-PCR system according to the
manufacturer′s instruction. The data were normalized
using endogenous GAPDH. Primers for qRT-PCR are
shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Constructs, reagents and assays
The perfect complementary sequence of miR-21
and the 3’UTRs of the human PTEN, PDCD4, and RECK
mRNA were cloned in between the Not1 and Xba1 sites

Oncotarget

of pRL-TK (Promega). Sequences of the other primers
were shown in Supplementary Table 3. MiRNA mimics
specifying miR-21 and control miRNA mimic were
obtained from Dharmcon Inc. Cisplatin is a product of
Hospira Austrila Pty Ltd., 5-fluorouracil is a product of
Tianjin Kingyork Amino Acid Co., Ltd., and pirarubicin
is a product of Shenzhen Main Luck Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Hep3b cells were seeded onto 24-well plates (1×105
cells per well) the day before transfections. Cells (≈70%
confluent) were transfected with pRL-TK luciferase
reports (50 ng per well), pGL3-control firefly luciferase
(10 ng per well). All transfections were carried out in
triplicate with Effectene (QIAGEN). Cell lysates were
prepared with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) 48 h after
transfection, and luciferase activities were measured by
using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega).

to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:100; DAKO). HRP
activity was detected using the Liquid DAB+ Substrate
Chromogen System (DAKO). Finally, sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin and photographed.

Evaluation of immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemistry stained sections were
examined using an Olympus Vanox-T AH-2 light
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The same
magnification (microscope objective) was used to record
all images in a particular series. Both the field limiting
and contrast apertures were kept at the fully open position
during (digital) photography to avoid any variability in
reproducing aperture settings. Images were recorded
with a Spot RTCCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments,
Sterling Heights, MI, USA) in color mode, using full
(1600× 1200 bit) resolution at 8-bit depth for each
(RGB) color component. The photographs were taken
with identical exposure settings. A flat field image was
obtained at the beginning of each microscopy session
and then used throughout the session to correct for
uneven illumination. The white balance was adjusted for
each slide. Recorded images were stored in color mode
as uncompressed files in tagged image file format. The
subsequent digital images were analyzed using the builtin functions of ImagePro Plus image analysis software 6.0
(Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) by three
pathologists simultaneously. Five fields of view were
chosen stochastically by each pathologist. The procedure
for determining the immunostaining intensity was as
previously described[40].

Cell growth assay
The cellular proliferation rate was measured using
CCK-8 (DOJINDO) as previously described[21]. To
measure the effects on cellular proliferation rates, cells
were incubated in 10% CCK-8 (DOJINDO) diluted in
normal culture media at 37 °C until the appearance of
visual color. Proliferation rates were determined at 12, 24,
36, 48, and 60 h post-transfection and quantification was
done on a microtiter plate reader (Spectra Rainbow, Tecan)
using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer.

Western blots
We extracted proteins from Hep3b, SMMC7721
cells, and HCC tissues with mammalian cell lysis buffer
M-PER (PIERCE) containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitor. Proteins from total cell lysates were resolved
with a 4-20% Tris-HCl gradient gel (Bio-Rad), transferred
to PVDF membranes, blocked in 5% nonfat milk or
BSA in TBS/Tween-20, and blotted with antibodies for
PTEN, PDCD4, RECK, c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos, p-AKT, AKT,
p-GSK3β, GSK3β, cyclin D1, cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4,
and GAPDH (RECK and c-Jun from BD biosciences,
cyclin D1, cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4, and GAPDH from
Abcam, others from CST).

HCC xenograft model
All animal procedures were performed according
to the national Animal Experimentation guidelines
(D.L.116/92) upon approval of the experimental protocol
by the Institutional Animal Experimentation Committee
of Peking Union Medical College. For the xenograft
assay, six-week-old female nude mice (BALB/c-nude)
were used to examine tumorigenicity. Hep3b HCC cells
with or without miR-21 inhibition by using lentiviral
system (Lenti-miR-21-I and Lenti-scr) were propagated
(6 × 106 cells saline/Matrigel (BD Pharmigen San Jose,
Ca), 1:1 v/v) and inoculated s.c. into the dorsal flanks of
20 mice (5 for each group as described). The size of the
tumors was measured by caliper twice a week, and tumor
volumes were calculated using the following formula:
Л/6×d2×D removed and weighed 7 weeks after tumor cell
injection. Treatments were started after tumor reached
approximately 100 mm3. 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) and
pirarubicin (20 mg/ m2) were administered once a week,
intravenously. Control mice received physiological saline
only, according to the same schedule.

Immunohistochemistry
HCC tissues and mouse tumor tissues were made
into paraffin sections and pretreated at 65°C for 2 hours,
followed by deparaffinization. Antigen retrieval was
carried out before application of the primary antibodies
(Ki-67, 1:100; DAKO), overnight at 4°C. As a negative
control, sections were incubated with normal IgG.
Thereafter, slides were incubated for 2 hours at room
temperature with the secondary antibody conjugated
