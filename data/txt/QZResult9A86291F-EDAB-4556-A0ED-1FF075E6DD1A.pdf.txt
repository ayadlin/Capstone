BACKGROUND: Intensive chemotherapy for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia incurs the risk of infectious complications, but the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis remain unclear. METHODS: In the current study, among 103 children treated on the AML02 protocol
between October 2002 and October 2008 at St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital, the authors retrospectively assessed the effect
of antibiotic prophylaxis on the frequency of febrile neutropenia, clinically or microbiologically confirmed infections (including bacteremia), and antibiotic resistance, as well as on the results of nasal and rectal surveillance cultures. Initially, patients received no prophylaxis or oral cephalosporin (group A). The protocol was then amended to administer intravenous cefepime alone or intravenous
vancomycin plus either oral cephalosporin, oral ciprofloxacin, or intravenous cefepime (group B). RESULTS: There were 334 infectious
episodes. Patients in group A had a significantly greater frequency of documented infections and bacteremia (both P <.0001) (including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia; P 5.0003 and .001, respectively) compared with patients in group B, especially viridans streptococcal bacteremia (P 5.001). The incidence of febrile neutropenia without documented infection was not found to be
different between the 2 groups. Five cases of bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) occurred in group B (vs none
in group A), without related mortality. Two of these cases were preceded by positive VRE rectal surveillance cultures. CONCLUSIONS:
Outpatient intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is feasible in children with acute myeloid leukemia and reduces the frequency of documented infection but not of febrile neutropenia. Despite the emergence of VRE bacteremia, the benefits favor antibiotic prophylaxis.
Creative approaches to shorten the duration of prophylaxis and thereby minimize resistance should be explored. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Although long-term survival has increased in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML),1,2 the highly myelosuppressive treatment frequently causes infection.3-5 For example, > 60% of patients in the Childrenâ€™s Cancer Group 2961 trial
experienced at least 1 microbiologically documented infection during therapy, and the cumulative infectious mortality
rate was 11%.3 Viridans group streptococci were frequently isolated.3-7
In adults with cancer and neutropenia, antibiotic prophylaxis reportedly reduced the frequency of febrile neutropenic episodes, clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial infection, and mortality.8-10 These findings
prompted amendment of the ongoing St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital (St. Jude) AML02 protocol to include outpatient antibiotic prophylaxis with intravenous (iv) cefepime or with iv vancomycin plus oral cephalosporin, oral ciprofloxacin, or iv cefepime.7 In a preliminary analysis (78 patients), these regimens were found to significantly reduce the
incidence of bacterial infection, especially viridans streptococcal infection, and the duration of hospital stay.7 In the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group AAML0531 study, antibacterial prophylaxis significantly reduced the frequency of sterile-site bacterial infections, including gram-positive infections.11 However, emergence of drug resistance remains a concern.12,13

Original Article

We examined the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis
on the frequency of bacteremia and other clinically or
microbiologically documented bacterial infections, on antibiotic sensitivity, and on nasal and rectal culture findings
in the full cohort of 103 patients treated at St. Jude on the
AML02 protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This retrospective study included all patients enrolled in
AML02 at St. Jude between October 2002 and October
200814 except those with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia
and those who had not completed at least 1 course of chemotherapy. The study was approved by the St. Jude Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was
obtained from patients or their legal guardians and assent
was given by the patients, as appropriate. This study was
performed during 2 induction and 3 consolidation chemotherapy courses (previously described).14 Induction 1 therapy comprised either high-dose (3 g/m2/dose 3 6 doses) or
low-dose (100 mg/m2/dose 3 20 doses) cytarabine combined with daunorubicin and etoposide (ADE).15 Initially,
patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) > 25% after
induction 1 received gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) with
induction 2 therapy (ADE) and those with MRD  0.1%
after induction 2 were treated with single-agent GO. The
protocol was amended to administer ADE and GO as
induction 2 to all patients with MRD 1% after induction
1, whereas others received ADE alone. Consolidation
therapy was based on final risk assignment.14
Antibiotic Prophylaxis

For the current study, prophylaxis comprised outpatient
administration of antibacterial drugs after myelosuppressive therapy and at the onset of an absolute neutrophil
count  0.5 3 109/L in the absence of fever or other indicators of infection. Prophylaxis was discontinued when
the absolute neutrophil count exceeded 0.1 3 109/L.
Complete blood counts were performed at least twice
weekly. The prophylactic regimens used in AML02 were
amended when short-term findings indicated the superiority of certain drug combinations.7 Initial prophylaxis
comprised oral cephalosporin antibiotics, which did not
prevent bacteremia. Cefepime (1500 mg/m2 administered
iv every 12 hours) was next introduced, followed by iv
vancomycin (400 mg/m2 every 12 hours) given with oral
cephalosporin (cefpodoxime at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 12
hours or cefuroxime at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 12
hours), oral ciprofloxacin (at a dose of 250 mg/m2 every
12 hours), or iv cefepime. All patients received antifungal
1986

prophylaxis with voriconazole or an echinocandin (caspofungin or micafungin) and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Granulocyteâ€“
colony-stimulating factor was not administered routinely.
Patients were hospitalized only during chemotherapy, and
parents were trained to administer outpatient parenteral
prophylactic antibiotics. During outpatient antibiotic
therapy, patients either stayed at their local residences (if
within 35 miles of St. Jude) or were housed in local domiciliary apartments. Patients with neutropenia who presented with fever or apparent infection were admitted and
treated empirically with vancomycin and cefepime (vancomycin and meropenem if they had received cefepime
prophylaxis or if clinically indicated). They were discharged if their blood cultures were negative for 48 hours
and they became afebrile for 24 hours, and prophylactic
antibiotics were resumed until count recovery.
Infection and Febrile Episodes

Infection events, including febrile neutropenia, were
defined by the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0), and
episodes  grade 3 were recorded.16 Fever was defined as
an oral temperature of 38.0 C persisting for at least 1
hour or a single oral temperature of 38.3 C. Clinically or
microbiologically documented infection events were
grouped together. Blood cultures were routinely obtained
from patients presenting with fever or other signs of infection. Samples obtained from all lumens of the central venous catheter were inoculated into a pair (per lumen) of
culture vials (BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F and BACTEC
Myco/F Lytic; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Peripheral blood
was cultured in parallel when feasible. A weight-based
scale was used to determine the volume of blood for cultures.17 Bloodstream infection was defined by Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention criteria,18 with the following exception for common commensals. Because of
the high risk posed by bacteremia, among those patients
with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, even 1 positive blood culture was considered to indicate a bloodstream infection
with viridans streptococci or Bacillus cereus. All positive
blood cultures obtained for febrile neutropenia or other
reasons at any time during treatment were reported.
All patients underwent surveillance cultures of the nares and rectum at each admission. Nasal surveillance was
conducted to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) and fungal pathogens. Rectal surveillance
was performed to detect vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus
(VRE) species, MRSA, Pseudomonas species, and fungi. Bacillus cereus was also noted if detected in these cultures.

oral cephalosporin (found to be ineffective in reducing
bacteremia7 and no longer used prophylactically at St.
Jude). Patients in group B received iv cefepime alone or iv
vancomycin plus oral cephalosporin, oral ciprofloxacin,
or iv cefepime. Patients in group C were already receiving
antibiotics for fever at the time of AML presentation or
before the onset of neutropenia, and therefore were unevaluable for that chemotherapy cycle.
The Fisher exact test was used to compare events of
interest with prophylactic antibiotic use. A generalized linear model was used to model antibiotics, treatment phase,
and treatment arm as class predictors of adverse events,
with an autoregressive 1-correlation structure to account
for the correlation of observations within subjects. All tests
were 2-sided, and a P value < .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference; there was no adjustment for multiple testing. All analyses used SAS statistical
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patients and Infectious Adverse Events

The characteristics of the 103 children are shown in Table
1. The median age at diagnosis was 8.7 years. Neutropenia
with fever of unknown origin was the most common type of
infectious event, followed by infection of the bloodstream,
skin/mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, and upper respiratory
tract (Table 2). One patient receiving oral cephalosporin
prophylaxis died of Bacillus cereus sepsis after consolidation
course 2, and 1 patient died of complications of respiratory
syncytial virus pneumonia after consolidation course 3.

group B underwent 274 courses of chemotherapy (64
patients with iv cefepime alone, and 210 with iv vancomycin plus oral cephalosporin [33 patients], oral ciprofloxacin [146 patients], or iv cefepime [31 patients]). Patients
in group B had significantly fewer episodes of infection
(any episodes) than did patients in group A during induction 1 (P 5 .002), induction 2 (P 5 .0002), and consolidation 2 (P 5 .0001). The frequency of episodes of febrile
neutropenia of unknown origin were not found to differ
significantly between groups A and B. Patients in group B
had significantly fewer clinically or microbiologically
documented infections (10.9%-29.4%) compared with
patients in group A (40.0%-89.5%) (P < .05 for all chemotherapy courses except single-agent GO). The majority
of infectious episodes reported among patients in groups
A and B occurred during consolidation 2, which had the
longest median duration (44 days). When the effects of

prophylaxis were evaluated in all courses combined by
taking treatment arms and courses into account in a generalized linear model, the frequency of febrile neutropenia
of unknown source was similar in groups A (33.6%) and
B (30.7%) (hazards ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.68-1.74 [P 5 .73;]) but the frequency of clinically or microbiologically documented
infections was significantly lower in group B (55.8% vs
19.7%) (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.13-0.31 [P < .0001;]). No
significant difference was observed between the incidence
of clinically or microbiologically documented infections

0.26; 95% CI, 0.13-0.53 [P 5 .0003]) and gram-negative
(HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.48 [P 5 .001]) isolates were
found to occur significantly less frequently in patients in
group B (Table 4). This decrease in group B was noted in
patients who had only 1 episode of bacteremia as well as in
those who experienced multiple episodes. Bacteremia
occurred in total during 48.6% of courses among patients
in group A (55 of 113 courses; 1 patient experienced 2 episodes in a course) (Table 4); 13 of these courses were in
patients who experienced only 1 bacteremia episode, and 42
were in those who had recurrent episodes. However, bacteremia occurred during only 8% of courses among patients in
group B (22 of 274 courses); 9 of these courses occurred in
patients who had a single bacteremia episode, and 13 were
reported in those with multiple events. There was no significant difference observed between the incidence of bacteremia in patients receiving prophylaxis with vancomycin
combinations and that in patients receiving cefepime alone
(HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.12-1.14 [P 5 .08]).
The incidence of viridans streptococcal bacteremia
was strikingly reduced, from 33 among 113 courses
(29.2%) in patients in group A to only 3 of 274 courses
(1.0%) among patients in group B (P 5 .001) (Table 4).
All 3 viridans streptococci events among patients in group
B were isolated during polymicrobial bacteremia in consolidation course 2 or 3. All viridans streptococci tested
were sensitive to vancomycin (36 cases: 32 in group A, 3
in group B, and 1 in group C) or clindamycin (22 cases:
20 in group A, 1 in group B, and 1 in group C). Reduced
penicillin sensitivity was observed in 17 of 23 isolates
tested (15 of 20 isolates in group A, 1 of 2 isolates in group
B, and 1 of 1 isolate in group C); 2 of 14 isolates tested
demonstrated reduced cefepime susceptibility (1 of 12
isolates in group A and 1 of 2 isolates in group B).
We observed 7 episodes (22.6%) of enterococcal
bacteremia among patients in group B during singleagent GO (1 episode) or consolidation (6 episodes) therapy but only 1 episode (1.7%, single-agent GO phase)
was noted to occur in group A. The isolate in group A was
vancomycin-sensitive, whereas 5 of the 7 isolates in group
B demonstrated reduced vancomycin susceptibility; 3
patients had received vancomycin prophylaxis and 2 had
received cefepime prophylaxis. Two of 5 isolates were
ampicillin-sensitive and no linezolid or quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance was noted.
Eight of 32 gram-negative isolates had reduced sensitivity to our first-line antibiotics; all 8 were isolated during consolidation therapy and 5 were isolated from group
B. Seven isolates demonstrated cefepime resistance (1

and 2 isolates (both Pseudomonas aeruginosa) had meropenem resistance.
Fungal and Clostridium Difficile Infection
Episodes

We identified 15 invasive fungal infections (12 of which
were culture-proven or histology-proven and 3 of which
were clinically diagnosed), most frequently during consolidation 2 (8 episodes), despite routine antifungal prophylaxis (Table 5). Eleven episodes occurred among patients in
group B, although we detected no statistically significant
difference between the 2 groups (HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 0.4810.32 [P 5 .30]). Six episodes involved the lungs and 5
each involved the sinuses and skin. All 12 proven cases were
mold infections and were treated with posaconazole and/or
liposomal amphotericin B. No deaths were related to fungal infection. Clostridium difficile toxin was identified in 14
episodes (8 in group A, 5 in group B, and 1 in group C).
Effect of Prophylaxis on Surveillance Results

Of 709 rectal surveillance cultures, 56 (7.9%) were positive, comprising 36 independent microbes (Table 6).
Three cultures (0.4%) preceded bacteremia, and 3 of the
16 bacteremia episodes of interest (18.8%) followed positive rectal surveillance. Of the 8 VRE isolates, 1 was from
group A and 7 were from group B. Three of the 7 patients

species, 1 Candida lusitaniae, and 1 MRSA. None of these
were associated with fungal infection or bacteremia.
DISCUSSION
Infection is a major complication of treatment for pediatric AML.3,19 The results of the current study demonstrate
that prophylaxis with vancomycin-containing regimens or
cefepime alone markedly reduced the frequency of grampositive and gram-negative bacteremia, especially viridans
streptococcal bacteremia, although VRE infection was
observed. Infection-related mortality rates of those
patients treated with or without antibiotic prophylaxis
were not significantly different.
Although the incidence of nonspecific febrile neutropenia was not reduced by our prophylaxis, the incidence of
clinically or microbiologically documented infection, including bacteremia, was found to be reduced during all courses
of induction and consolidation therapy. There was no significant difference noted between the incidence of clinically or
microbiologically documented infections or bacteremia in
those receiving vancomycin combinations and that in those
receiving cefepime alone. Cefepime-only prophylaxis is useful for younger children, especially when oral ciprofloxacin is
not feasible. Of note cefepime does not provide reliable coverage against Bacillus cereus.7 Therefore, we currently use a
vancomycin and ciprofloxacin combination for those who
can take ciprofloxacin orally. Supportive management,
including routine antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis, the
routine use of granulocyteâ€“colony-stimulating factor, and
criteria for discharge during neutropenia, varies considerably
both within and outside of the United States.20,21 At some
centers, penicillin is believed to provide effective prophylaxis
of viridans streptococcal infection. In the current study, viridans streptococci were the main cause of bacteremia, and
greater than one-half of tested isolates were found to be
penicillin-resistant; however, sensitivity patterns may differ
substantially between countries or facilities. Our prophylactic antibiotic approach (cefepime alone or vancomycincontaining combinations) markedly reduced the incidence
of viridans streptococcal bacteremia, as previously reported.7
The 3 episodes noted among patients in group B involved
polymicrobial infection and occurred during consolidation
therapy. Although to our knowledge the primary etiology of
polymicrobial infections is unclear, the greater frequency of
documented infection and bacteremia during consolidation
therapy is likely to reflect cumulative chemotherapy doses
and prolonged myelosuppression.
A major concern we identified is the emergence of resistance, particularly VRE and resistance of gram-negative
bacteria to our first-line antibiotics. Patients colonized and/or
Cancer

infected with such bacteria must typically undergo contact
isolation, and strict infectious disease control protocols are
recommended.22-25 Antibiotic options for VRE are limited to
linezolid, daptomycin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Patients
with hematological malignancies are more susceptible to
VRE than patients with other malignancies because of the
routine use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.23,24 In the current
study, all 5 patients with VRE bacteremia were receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. Furthermore, 8 of the 32 gram-negative
bacteremia isolates obtained during consolidation phases
demonstrated reduced sensitivity to first-line antibiotics,
although no substantial morbidity or mortality was found to
be associated with these bacteria. It is important to note that
we cannot completely differentiate the relative contributions
of antibiotic prophylaxis versus routine antibiotic therapy to
the emergence of resistance, because antibiotic resistance was
observed primarily during later treatment phases and VRE
bacteremia was observed not only in patients who received
vancomycin combinations but also in those who received
cefepime only. Antimicrobial stewardship can improve the
appropriate selection, dosing, route, and duration of overall
antimicrobial use in patients with cancer and limit the emergence and transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.26
At the study institution, rectal and nasal surveillance at
the time of admission has been routine since the 1990s. The
low frequency of positive nasal findings and their lack of
association with microbiologically documented infections in
the current study suggest that nasal surveillance offers little
value. Bacteremia was not often preceded by positive rectal
surveillance in the current study. However, 8 of the patients
reported herein had VRE rectal colonization, which preceded VRE bacteremia in 2 patients. These patientsâ€™ antibiotics were changed to a VRE-appropriate regimen before the
bloodstream pathogen was identified. As many as 30% of
VRE-colonized patients have experienced VRE bacteremia.23,24 We observed Candida species colonization in 18
cultures (17 in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis or
treatment) but no invasive fungal infection. In the AML97
study, which did not use prophylactic antifungals, Candida
and Aspergillus species were predominantly isolated.27 Our
routine use of antifungals likely prevented invasive candidiasis. Mold infections were noted and treated with posaconazole and liposomal amphotericin B.28 The cost-effectiveness
of rectal surveillance should be examined, especially for the
detection of VRE and its impact on antibiotic prescription
and isolation practices in patient populations heavily exposed
to antimicrobials, such as the one in the current study.
Effective prophylaxis is possible but not always feasible, being prone to logistical and financial limitations.
First, each center would have to train caregivers to

administer outpatient iv antibiotics. Second, the cost of
medication and equipment must be covered, although it
would be offset by the reduced costs associated with infection.7 Finally, the current study is a retrospective and sequential study with potential inherent confounding
factors due to the time span of several years.
The results of the current study have demonstrated
that iv antibacterial prophylaxis is feasible in children with
AML; reduces the incidence of clinically and/or microbiologically documented infection, including bacteremia;
and enables outpatient management rather than the mandated hospitalization until count recovery. Although VRE
infection was noted to occur with antibiotic prophylaxis,
there was no related mortality. We conclude that the benefits favor the use of outpatient prophylactic antibiotics.
Creative approaches are necessary to reduce the intensity
and duration of prophylaxis so as to minimize the development of resistant bacterial strains.
