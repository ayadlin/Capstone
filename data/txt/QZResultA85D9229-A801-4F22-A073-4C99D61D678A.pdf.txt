ABSTRACT
The RNA binding protein Lin28 is best known for the critical role in cell
development, recent researches also have implied its oncogenic function in various
human cancers, including breast cancer. Specifically, aberrant Lin28 participates
in multiple pathological processes, such as proliferation, metastasis, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy resistance, metabolism, immunity and inflammation as well as
stemness. In this review, we summarize the let-7-dependent and let-7-independent
mechanism regulated by Lin28, focusing on its relation with tumor hallmarks in
breast cancer, and subsequently discuss our present knowledge of Lin28 to develop
a molecular-based therapeutic strategy against breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

to review existing literatures on the molecular mechanisms
of Lin28, along with its roles in breast cancer. To our
knowledge, this is the first review focusing on Lin28 in
breast cancer. We believe that a more comprehensive
understanding of Lin28 function will yield preventive,
diagnostic, predictive and therapeutic advances for breast
cancer.

Breast cancer is a complex and poorly understood
disease which affects 1 in 10 females. It is the leading
cause of death in women between the ages of 40 and 50
years [1]. Since breast cancer is highly heterogeneous
in terms of biological behavior, researchers have made
extensive efforts to conquer this challenge. In the last few
decades, several novel molecular or cellular factors were
identified in breast cancer, including Lin28 and its related
factors [2]. Currently, the mainstream opinion is that Lin28
mainly functions as an oncogene. Mechanistically, Lin28
is involved in various pathological processes of cancers
via let-7 dependent and let-7 independent pathways [3].
With a deeper understanding of how Lin28 is involved in
breast cancer initiation and progression, new findings will
be valuable in helping us to explore variably targetable
mechanisms of breast cancer. The purpose of this article is

MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF LIN28
AND ITS TWO PATHWAYS
Basic knowledge of Lin28
Firstly identified as a regulator of developmental
timing in Caenorhabditis elegans [4], Lin28 is now well
established as an RNA binding protein and transcription

factor implicated in stem cell differentiation, normal
development, glucose metabolism, and cancer [5]. Lin28
has two RNA-binding motifs: a cold shock domain (CSD)
and a Cys-Cys-His-Cys (CCHC) zinc finger domain
[6]. Mammals produce two Lin28 paralogs: Lin28A and
Lin28B, which have identical regions in structures and
functional similarities but differ in a few respects [7].
For instance, Lin28B has additional sections: a nuclear
localization signal (NLS) and a nucleolar localization
signal (NoLS), and is therefore primarily located in
nucleus and nucleolus. Lin28A on the other hand is
predominantly located in the cytosol of cells (Figure 1).
The let-7 family of microRNA (miRNA), which
was also firstly discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans
[8], has been reported to be a key suppressive target of
Lin28, and serves as a potent tumor suppressor via posttranscriptional repression of multiple oncogenic messenger
RNA (mRNA) [9]. Meanwhile, the convergence of
abundant in vitro and in vivo structural studies have
discovered the molecular basis of the interaction between
Lin28 and other target RNAs, whose Lin28 binding sites
vary depending on their sequence and context [10]. It is
therefore appropriate to assign the critical functions of
Lin28 to one of two classifications: let-7 dependent and
let-7 independent.

degradation of the RNAs [11-13]. Another study indicated
that Lin28 used two different TUTases to control let-7
expression and had important implications for stem cell
biology as well as cancer [19]. Taken together, regulation
of let-7 expression is controlled by Lin28 proteins through
the post-transcriptional blockade of let-7 biogenesis.
Interestingly, Lin28A and Lin28B mRNAs themselves
have potential let-7 complementary sites (3’UTR of
Lin28) and serve as let-7 targets, making let-7 regulate
Lin28 expression by cleaving Lin28 mRNAs or inhibiting
translation of Lin28 mRNAs [6, 20-25]. Additionally, the
let-7 target genes, such as c-MYC [26] and CDC25A [23],
could regulate their downstream Lin28 via translational
repression, making let-7 an indirect inhibitor of Lin28.
Therefore, Lin28/let-7 axis establishes a double-negative
feedback loop whereby either let-7 or Lin28 is expressed
at high levels, promoting physiological or pathological
conditions, respectively (Figure 2).

Let-7 independent functionality
Interaction of Lin28 and mRNA
As for let-7 independent way, Cho et al. mapped
the Lin28A binding sites on the genomic scale by RNA
crosslinking-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (CLIP-seq)
technology and ribosome footprinting. They observed
that Lin28A binds to a large number of spliced mRNAs
by recognizing AAGNNG, AAGNG, and less frequently
UGUG, which are located in the terminal loop of a small
hairpin [27]. In their study, Lin28A was found to be
enriched in the peri-endoplasmic reticulum region and
bound to the cytosolic surface of rough endoplasmic
reticulum (RER) on which endoplasmic reticulumassociated mRNAs were translated in undifferentiated
stem cells. Several other studies have reported that Lin28
could activate OCT4 mRNA translation through binding
to OCT4 mRNA in complex with RNA helicase A in
polysomes [28, 29], and that Lin28 could directly enhance
translation efficiency of IGF2 mRNA during murine
muscle cell differentiation [30]. It is worth mentioning
that besides OCT4 and IGF2, researchers further found
that a series of mRNAs bound by Lin28 were enriched
in glycolysis and glucose metabolism, e.g., GPAA1 and
GNPDA1 [31]. These interactions between Lin28 and
mRNAs are based on linear sequence recognition motifs,

Let-7 dependent functionality
Lin28 homologs (Lin28A and Lin28B) are small ( <
30kDa) proteins which can block the processing of let-7
family members by binding to the terminal loop of the let-7
precursor (pre-let-7) hairpin via a CSD and two retrovirallike CHCC zinc-finger knuckles [11-13]. The GGAG
sequences in the terminal loop of let-7 precursors serve as
the binding sites for the zinc finger domains critical for let7 regulation [14]. Subsequent reports have demonstrated
that Lin28 blocks the processing of let-7 at primary,
precursor, and mature forms of let-7 family members,
as Microprocessor complexes (DGCR8 and Drosha) and
DICER complexes cannot associate with Lin28-bound let7 [15-17]. Furthermore, studies revealed that Lin28A and
Lin28B inhibited let-7 biogenesis by distinct mechanisms.
Lin28B sequesters primary let-7 transcripts and inhibits
their processing by the Microprocessor [18], while
Lin28A recruits TUTase4 to induce oligo-uridylation of
pre-let-7, which blocks DICER processing and facilitates

Figure 1: Domains of human Lin28A and Lin28B proteins. Lin28A and Lin28B share several common domains: the CSD
(yellow) and CCHC (orange), while Lin28B contains both NoLS and NLS (gray). Numbers denote amino acids.

Lei et al. also reported specific structural determinants
for Lin28 binding with its targeted mRNAs, including
HMGA1, EEF1G and RPS13 mRNAs [32]. More
precisely, the motif is characterized by a small ‘A’ bulge
flanked by two G:C base pairs embedded in a larger
secondary structure, which mediates Lin28-dependent
stimulation of mRNA translation.

including proliferation, chemo-resistance, metabolism,
inflammation, stemness and cell development (Figure 3).

MULTIPLE PROCESSES REGULATED BY
LIN28 IN BREAST CANCER
In malignancies, a more common phenomenon
is that the expression of Lin28 is up-regulated. The
correlational studies have shown that Lin28 may be
transcriptionally activated by upstream factors, e.g.
c-Myc, Src, NF-κB and Wnt [18, 38]. For instance, c-Myc
is found to be associated with the genomic locus encoding
Lin28 and transactivate the Lin28 promoter, leading
Lin28 to become the direct target of MYC [39]. Besides,
Chen et al. demonstrated that the C allele of rs3811463,
a SNP that located near the let-7 binding-site of Lin28,
could weaken the suppression of Lin28 by let-7, which
means an increasing level in Lin28 expression along
with a reduction of let-7 level, elevating the risk of breast
cancer [40]. In fact, Lin28 is reactivated by oncogenes
in approximately 15% of all analyzed cancers, and its
expression is correlated to advanced stages of various
types of cancer, including breast cancer [41]. Using tissue
microarrays, researchers have demonstrated that Lin28
is expressed in a collection of human breast cancer cell
lines, while cultured normal human breast epithelial
cells have no detectable Lin28 expression. Furthermore,
Lin28 expression was detected in ductal carcinoma in
situ (DCIS) specimens but not in any benign breast tumor
specimens [42]. Taken together, these data have shown

Interaction of Lin28 and miRNA
Lin28 also could activate or inhibit other miRNAs
besides the let-7 family. For example, Lin28 inhibition
has recently been demonstrated to decrease the level of
abundance of miR-17∼92 family miRNAs, which may
be connected with the molecular basis of GGAG motif
in miRNAs [33]. Among aforementioned miRNAs, Peters
et al. focused on the putative tumor suppressor miR-363,
discovering that miR-363 RNA segment, which contains
the GGAG motif, formed a relatively stable complex with
the Lin28 protein. Knockdown of Lin28 could lead to
decreased level of mature miR-363, implying that Lin28
functioned as a positive regulator of miR-363 biogenesis
[34]. Additionally, Lin28 could differentially promote and
inhibit specific fates of cells by inhibiting miR-302d with
its CSD domain [35], miR-125b could efficiently reduce
Lin28 protein levels via directly binding to the 3’-UTR
region of the Lin28 mRNA [36]. Intriguingly, Willbert
et al. have reported that Lin28 directly enhances its own
expression level by binding to sites within its 3’UTR,
revealing a mechanism of positive feedback regulation
by Lin28 [37]. In fact, Lin28 can regulate multiple
tumor-associated progressions in let-7 independent way,

Figure 2: Lin28’s let-7-dependent functionality. A primary let-7 (pri-let-7) transcript produced by let-7 gene is processed by the
Drosha DGCR8 microprocessor in the nucleus. Then the generated precursor let-7 (pre-let-7) is transported to the cytosol and further
processed by the Dicer and Argonaute proteins (AGO) to generate the mature let-7. The biogenesis of pri-let-7 is blocked by Lin28A in the
nucleus and Lin28B in the nucleolus, the biogenesis of pre-let-7 and mature let-7 are blocked by Lin28A/B in the cytosol, and the mature
let-7 can in turn block the biogenesis of Lin28A/B. Solid line arrows refer to induction and promotion, dash line arrows refer to only
promotion, while hammerheads refer to inhibition.

that expression of Lin28 is frequently up-regulated in
breast cancer. Here, we will overview mechanisms and
functions of Lin28 as well as multiple cancer-associating
progressions regulated by Lin28 (Figure 4).

that Lin28A dramatically promoted the G0/G1 transition
rather than its role of enhancing G2/M transition in human
embryonic stem cells (ESCs), further works are needed
to explain the reason why Lin28A controls different cell
cycle regulators among different cells. Adding another
layer of meaning to the complex downstream effects of
Lin28 are some studies in which Lin28 itself binds to
many mRNAs and enhances their translation, including
IGF2 and Cyclin A/B [30, 35].
Furthermore, Sharma et al. reported that combining
the Lin28/let-7a/Kras axis inhibitors (NVP-LDE-225 and
NVP-BEZ-235) could inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting
Bcl-2 family members and activating caspases and by
suppressing PI3K-mTOR pathway, suggesting that Lin28/
let-7a may be involved in the apoptosis and proliferation
of cancer cells simultaneously [47]. Since several studies
indicate that the tumor-associated neovasculature,
generated by the process of angiogenesis, could also
promote tumor growth, researchers have investigated in
the involvement of Lin28/let-7 axis in angiogenesis. For
instance, Isanejad et al. found that markers for aggressive
breast cancer cells (such as Ki67 and ERα) or for tumor

Lin28 promotes cancer cell proliferation
Arguably, the most fundamental feature of
Lin28 in breast cancer cells is it ability to promote and
sustain chronic proliferation. Many studies focusing
on proliferative signaling in cancers suggest that Lin28
functions as an oncogene by repressing let-7, leading to
the dysregulation of multiple genes regulated directly
or indirectly by let-7, including MYC, Hmga2, and
components of PI3K-mTOR pathway [43-46]. In the
aspect of cell cycle, Li et al. have demonstrated that Lin28
promotes proliferation of tumor cells through regulating
the G0/G1 transition in cell cycle, namely, increasing the
expression of Cyclin D1/D2, CDC25A, CDK34, CDK6, as
well as other cell cycle-related factors by depressing let-7
[42]. We should note that Figure 5 in Li’s article showed

with proliferation (CyclinA/B/D, CDK1/2/4/6, miR-125b), chemoresistance (pRb, p21, Bcl-xL, miR-107), metabolism (IGF2, Oxidative

RNAs. Arrows refer to promotion, while hammerheads refer to inhibition.

epithelial phenotype to mesenchymal phenotype, and
Lin28/let-7 axis is also a prerequisite for the process of
EMT among some cases [51]. Liu et al. found that overexpression of Lin28 in breast cancer cells remarkably
decreased the expression of E-cadherin but increased
Vimentin, thus facilitating metastasis [52]. In the Table 3
of the article, they also reported that Lin28 correlated with
axillary lymph node, distal metastases and PR. However,
the authors found no signiﬁcant correlation between
Lin28 and ER or HER2 expression, therefore large-scale
clinical samples are needed to ensure Lin28 to serve
as a prognostic marker for patients with breast cancer.
Furthermore, Wang et al. demonstrated that in breast
cancer cell lines, let-7a could suppress cell migration by
significantly blocking the direct binding target of Lin28,
which provided evidence for the potential therapeutic role
of targeting Lin28 strategies in conquering metastasis in
breast cancer [53].

Lin28 expression promotes cancer cell metastasis
Abnormal Lin28 activation is found in diverse
human malignancies, especially in poorly differentiated
and highly aggressive tumors [49]. Rosner et al. have
revealed that Lin28 facilitates bone metastasis in Raf
kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP)-expressing breast tumors
[50]. More specifically, the results support a model in
which RKIP suppresses Raf-1/MEK/ERK activity, leading
to the inhibition of Lin28 and induction of let-7, finally
blocking the induction of Snail transcription and other
genes involved in tumor cell invasion and metastatic
colonization. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition

enhanced the sensitivity to radiation [55]. Sun et al. have
demonstrated that miR-208a-SOX2/β-catenin-Lin28-let7a-DICER1 regulatory feedback loop participates in the
therapy resistance of breast cancer through promoting
the induction of the cancer stem cells [56]. Based on the
Figure 5 of their work, miR-208a increased the activity
of DICER1 while let-7a directly targeted and degraded
DICER1 mRNA, it is necessary to investigate whether
the observation could be explained by the competitive
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis. Since the impact
of Lin28/let-7 axis on radio-sensitivity has been confirmed
in vitro, increasing evidence has shown that down-

cancer patients, and abundant evidences have shown
that over-expression of Lin28 contributed to cancer cell

instance, Wang et al. found that Lin28 expression was
up-regulated in radiation-resistant breast cancer cells.

expression of Lin28 and over-expression of let-7 could
decrease the expression of RAS oncogene and genes
associated with DNA like RAD51, RAD21, FANCD2 and
CDC25, eventually radiosensitizing the cancer cells [5759].
In the aspect of drug resistance, Teng et al. reported
that over-expression of Lin28 decreased the sensitivity to
chemotherapy (e.g. Oxaliplatin, Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin
and Fluorouracil) via inhibiting miR-107, as well as the
RNA and protein expression of c-Myc and P-gp [60].
Other researchers also have found that Lin28-induced
chemotherapy resistance is associated with let-7, Rb, p21
and Bcl-xL, thus unraveling complicated relationship
between Lin28 and tumor resistance [61, 62]. As for
clinical study, by evaluating the polymorphism of Lin28
gene between breast cancer females and healthy controls,
researchers have found that genetic variations in Lin28
might be a possible mechanism underlying susceptibility
and clinical features in breast cancer, including the
response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [63].

adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but cancer cells choose
to rely on glycolysis even under the sufficient oxygen
condition, a phenomenon later known as the Warburg
effect [64]. Since then interest in this topic has increased,
and major areas of knowledge have been gained, but
fundamentally important questions remain unresolved.
Extensive studies have provided the evidence
that conditional deletion of Lin28 could lead to insulin
resistance and impaired glucose uptake. Let-7 transgenic
mice not only reduced body size and growth retardation,
but also led to hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance
[45]. As for breast cancer, Yang et al. performed RNAprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) coupled with genomewide sequencing (RIP-Seq) to identify endogenous Lin28
mRNA targets. Data suggested that Lin28 regulated the
expression of a unique set of mRNAs, whose expression
is involved in classic cancer metabolism [65]. More
accurately, Lin28 down-expression could inhibit insulin
sensitivity mostly by suppressing the let-7 targets Insr,
IGF1r, Irs2, Akt2, and Rictor, and also in part by directly
reducing the ribosomal translation of mRNAs encoding
IGF2 and mitochondrial OxPhos enzymes.
Of course, other researches on metabolism have
different voices. Zhang et al. found that induction of
Lin28 over-expressing mouse ESCs compromised basal
and maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), but
that levels of let-7 did not change from their already

Lin28 contributes to enhanced cell metabolism

normoxic conditions, normal cells metabolize glucose by
using mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylations (OxPhos)
instead of glycolysis to maximize the production of

suppressed levels [66]. According to figure S4 in their
study, authors not only verified that let-7 mimic in Lin28overexpressing cells could not reverse the reduced OCR,
but also knockdowned Lin28 in Dgcr8−/− ESCs (scant
quantities of let-7) to exclude other possibly let-7-related
microRNAs function. Both the experimental design and
result are quite rigorous and precise, which deserves our
respect and learning. Other studies also found that gain or
loss of function of let-7 in wild-type cells did not change
OCR, suggesting that Lin28 reduced OCR through several
let-7-independent mechanisms [67].

tumors, including breast cancer [77]. Human mammary
epithelial cells transformed by EMT could significantly
enhance their self-renewal and tumor-initiating
capabilities, and lead to the expression of stem-cell
markers typically associated with the stemness of breast
cancer cells [78]. Studies in the past decade have shown
that the Lin28/let-7 axis plays a significant role in stem
cell renewal [79]. For example, Cai et al. have reported
that Lin28 upregulation and let-7 posttranscriptional
downregulation were identified in the Wnt-β-catenin
pathway-stimulated breast CSCs phenotype, while loss
of function of Lin28 impaired Wnt-β-catenin-pathwaymediated let-7 inhibition and breast cancer stem cell
expansion [80]. The in-depth mechanism revealed that
Lin28 could act as a novel direct downstream target of the
Wnt-β-catenin pathway, namely, both LEF1 and β-catenin
were found to directly bind to the Lin28 promoter. Feng
et al. have implicated that over-expression of HER2 in
breast cancer increases the population of CSCs, which
also correlates with the high Lin28 expression level [81].
Specifically, their discoveries suggested that Lin28 could
bind to HER2 mRNA and stimulate its translation via a
200-nucleotide sized Lin28-responsive element (LRE) in
HER2 mRNA. But according to the Figure 4 illustrated
in Feng’s article, targeting HER2 alone by Herceptin
(Trastuzumab) is insufficient to inhibit the level of Lin28,
thus the study of Lin28/HER2 positive feedback loop
still need to be investigated. Moreover, Wu et al. found
that cell fate determination factor Dach1 reduced breast
tumor formation in serial transplantations in vivo, further
unraveling that in breast cancer cells Dach1 directly bonds
to the promoter region of Lin28, Sox2 and Nanog genes
and inhibits their expression, finally decreases expansion
of CSCs population and blocks breast tumor growth [82].
It is worth mentioning that Jolly et al. discovered that
independent of let-7, Lin28 was strongly inhibited by miR200 which pushed epithelial end towards mesenchymal
end of CSCs, thus allowing mesenchymal phenotype cells
to gain stemness [83] (Table 1).

Lin28 is involved in immunity and inflammation
In addition to the above-mentioned role of Lin28
in cancer, several frontier researches have suggested that
Lin28 may be implicated in the immune system [68].
For example, researchers reported that Lin28 in myeloid
could affect mast cell differentiation and promote mast cell
malignancy [69]. Mast cells, the critical components of
the innate immune system, release a serine protease called
Tryptase, which was demonstrated to play a positive role
in tumor angiogenesis of breast cancer [70]. Several other
investigators have provided evidence that Lin28 promotes
tumor growth via enhancing the development of T cells, B
cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells [71-74].
In regards to inflammation, Iliopoulos et al. have
observed that Src, an oncoprotein in immortalized breast
cells, could activate a rapid inflammatory response
mediated by NF-κB. The response then led to Lin28regulated expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine
interleukin-6 (IL-6) via inhibiting let-7 expression, thus
revealing a new mechanism containing cancer cells and
immune molecules [75, 76]. They also found that let-7
inhibited IL-6 expression both directly through its 3’UTR
and indirectly by interacting with RAS to reduce the NFκB activity. As for other inflammatory mechanisms, Yang
et al. have reported that breast cancer cells lacking Lin28
could increase levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines,
and that the regulation of the major cytokine genes is
dependent on the expression of hnRNP A1, suggesting a
mechanism independent of let-7 [65]. Meanwhile, Yang et
al. also found that despite of the cooperation to regulate
nuclear processes, depletion of Lin28 and hnRNP A1
proteins yielded nonidentical effects on mRNA splicing
(presented in Figure 6 of the article). The phenomenon
may be attributed to that RT-PCR assay is not sensitive
enough and transcript isoforms are confounded by other
cellular factors.

CURRENT OPINIONS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES ON LIN28 IN BREAST
CANCER
Breast cancer is a disease plagued by recurrences
with progressive drug resistance, ultimately leading to
uncontrolled cancer progress. It is now evident that Lin28
does play roles in breast cancer initiation, progression and
maintenance. However, the challenge that lies ahead is
how to integrate our improved molecular understanding
of Lin28 and breast cancer pathogenesis with novel
therapeutic options, ultimately improving patient
outcomes.

members, have been most notably implicated in cancer

breast cancer is supported by studies examining let-7
expression in breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples
(Table 2). The majority of studies revealed that most of
let-7 family members were down-regulated in breast
cancer samples with either lymph node metastasis or
higher proliferation index versus normal tissues [85-88],
while one study showing up-regulation of let-7b [89].
Subsequently, several functional studies have reported
novel mechanisms of let-7 in breast cancer cells [90-97].
As for clinical researches, apart from cases for let-7 as
the classical suppressor [98], other studies have suggested
that let-7 does not function as a tumor suppressor under all
circumstances [99-101].
For neoteric findings, studies using 26 breast cancer
surgical specimens found Lin28 expression to be positively
correlated with ER and PR status but inversely correlated
with HER2 status [102, 103]. In addition to the known
risk factors like ER, PR and HER2, Shen et al. have found
that Lin28 and AR (androgen receptor ) co-expression is a
strong predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer [104].
Although the positive feedback mechanism of Lin28 and
AR is still not clear, researchers can conduct in-depth
studies in this new research domain. Moreover, Liu et al.
found that Hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP), a
novel oncoprotein, could promote proliferation of breast
cancer cells by up-regulating Lin28B [105]. Segalla et al.
reported that the ribonuclease DIS3 could promote let7 maturation and inhibit Lin28B mRNA levels through
recognition of AU-rich elements in the 3’UTR [106].
Therefore, therapeutically canonical and non-canonical
key factors may serve as the target to control upstream
or downstream miRNAs and direct mRNA regulation of
Lin28, which will guide attempts to use Lin28 as a target
for treating human breast cancer.
Recent advanced studies also have revealed that
long non-coding RNA H19 acts as a sponge to antagonize
let-7. For example, the ability of let-7 to repress the
expression of an array of metastasis-promoting genes is
compromised when H19 expression is high, leading to
decreased bio-availability of let-7, increased expression
of c-Myc, Hmga2 and Imp3, and activation of cell
migration and invasion [107], thus prompting us to study
the relationship among H19, let-7 and Lin28 during
carcinogenesis. Researchers’ findings also included that
metformin, a drug used for treating type-2 diabetes, could
down-regulate H19 at least in part by altering methylation
of the H19 promoter, thus presenting anti-tumor effects
on tumor cells. In addition, Lin28 has been found to
participate in other popular research fields, including
exosomes, autophagy and cells polarity. For instance,
high Lin28A expressing exosomes could induce EMTrelated gene expression and promote non-metastatic
target cells to migrate and invade [108], Lin28 suppressor
let-7 could activate autophagy by repressing the mTOR
signaling pathway [109], human induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) generated by Lin28 could spontaneously
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

differentiate into polarized retinal pigmented epithelium
[110]. Taken together, it is necessary for us to further
investigate the concrete mechanism of Lin28, which may
open up new research avenues for cancer diagnostics and
treatment.
In fact, aberrant expression of Lin28 stimulates
tumorigenesis in many other kinds of cancers, including
lung [111], hepatocellular [112], gastric [113], colon
[114], kidney [115], and ovarian carcinoma [116]. More
precisely, novel findings involve that Lin28 interacts with
a protein expressed by Hepatitis B virus to enhance the
proliferation of hepatoma cells [112], Lin28 activates
genes that simultaneously enhance both metastasis and
cell differentiation in colon cancer [114], higher Lin28
expression is associated with worse pathologic tumor
responses under the neoadjuvant chemotherapy [113],
Lin28 expression in kidney cells promotes metabolic
switching (the increasing rate of glycolysis) to a
phenotype related with cancer [115]. IL-1β-miR-101Lin28 is certified as a novel pathogenic inflammatory
signaling in non-small cell lung cancer [111]. Lin28
together with OCT4 can be used to identify subgroups of
stem cell-like cells in ovarian cancer [116]. Additionally,
except for researches that Lin28/let-7 loop is involved
in ten hallmarks of cancer [117], the aberrant loop also
regulates cellular senescence and has connection with
various oncogenes and signaling pathways, including
MYC, RAS, MAPK signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling
[118]. Although above mechanisms have not fully been
verified in breast cancer, they could provide us new
thoughts and references, based on similarity of traits of
Lin28 and relative factors, we may propose a series of
bold experiments to promote new discoveries.
Nowadays, available data suggest that inhibition of
Lin28 in breast cancer holds great therapeutic potential
for the treatment of breast cancer. However, it remains to
be determined when and to what extent, Lin28 might be
involved in preventive, predictive or prognostic functions.
Further endeavors will unravel its precise roles in the
pathogenesis of breast cancer. It is not difficult to predict
that exciting times are still ahead for researches studying
Lin28.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, Lin28 has been observed to be
frequently up-regulated in breast cancer. Through
canonical and non-canonical pathways, high levels of
Lin28 could promote cellular proliferation, metastasis,
radio- and chemo-resistance, metabolism reprogramming,
immunity and inflammation, and tumor-associated
stemness in breast cancer. Although the Lin28 related
regulatory network remains unclear, it would certainly be
an intriguing frontier to study and a valuable hotspot for
future breast cancer therapeutic strategies.
