Systemic Treatment After Whole-Brain
Radiotherapy in Patients With Brain Metastases
Anna Niwińska, MD, PhD1; Magdalena Murawska, MSc2; and Katarzyna Pogoda, MD1

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the role of systemic treatment after whole-brain radiotherapy
(WBRT) in immunohistochemically defined biological subsets of breast cancer patients with brain metastases.
METHODS: The group of 420 consecutive breast cancer patients with brain metastases treated at the same institution between the years of 2003 to 2009 was analyzed. Patients were divided into 4 immunohistochemically biological subsets, based on the levels of estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
receptors, and labeled as luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple-negative. Survival from brain metastases with and
without systemic treatment after WBRT was calculated in 4 subsets. RESULTS: In the entire group, the median survival from brain metastases in patients without and with systemic treatment after WBRT was 3 and 10 months,
respectively (P < .0001). In the triple-negative subset, the median survival from brain metastases with and without
systemic treatment was 4 and 3 months (P ¼ .16), and in the luminal A subset, it was 12 and 3 months, respectively (P
¼ .003). In the luminal B subset, the median survival without further treatment, after chemotherapy and/or hormonal
therapy, and after chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy with targeted therapy was 2 months, 9 months, and 15
months, respectively (P < .0001). In the HER2 subset, the median survival was 4 months, 6 months, and 13 months,
respectively (P < .0001). No significant response to systemic treatment was noted in the triple-negative breast cancer population. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic therapy, ordered after WBRT, appears to improve survival in patients with
the luminal A, luminal B, and HER2 breast cancer subtypes. Targeted therapy was found to have an additional positive
impact on survival. In patients with triple-negative breast cancer, the role of systemic treatment after WBRT appears

Recently, it has been reported that the incidence of brain metastases from breast cancer has increased due to prolonged survival of patients and the development of imaging techniques. Generally, the prognosis of patients with brain
metastases is poor. The median survival of untreated patients is approximately 1 month. Symptomatic treatment with steroids prolongs survival to approximately 2.5 months. Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) increases the median survival to
approximately 4 to 6 months. In 10% of patients, surgical excision of brain metastasis followed by whole-brain irradiation
prolongs median survival up to 1 to 2 years.1 Recently, the role of systemic therapy after WBRT has been investigated for
2 reasons. First, breast cancer is a rather chemosensitive disease. Second, it has been reported that not all breast cancer
patients with central nervous system metastases die due to intracranial progression. The analysis of causes of death revealed
that, in approximately 50% of cases, patients die from the cancer’s progression within the brain and that the other 50% of
patients die from the cancer’s progression in the viscera.2-5 The above results suggest that, to control at least extracranial
disease, continuation of systemic treatment after WBRT appears to be a reasonable approach.
To the best of our knowledge, little is known regarding the survival differences among patients with breast cancer
and various subtypes of brain metastases. In our previous study concerning 222 patients, the median survival from brain

metastases in patients with luminal A, luminal B, human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and in triplenegative subtypes was 15 months, 9 months, 9 months,
and 3.7 months, respectively.6 In the study by Nam et al,7
it was 4 months, 9 months, 5 months, and 3.4 months,
respectively. Moreover, in the study by Lin et al, the
median survival from brain metastasis in patients with
triple-negative breast cancer was 4.9 months.5
The aim of this study was to assess the impact of systemic treatment sequenced after WBRT and the effect it
had on survival from brain metastases in immunohistochemically defined biological subsets of breast cancer
patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between January 1, 2003, and June 30, 2009, 420
patients with breast cancer and brain metastases were
treated in Breast Cancer and Reconstructive Surgery
Department at The Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial
Cancer Center, Warsaw, Poland. The observation of
patients started at the time of the detection of brain metastases, and all data were collected prospectively in a database. In each case, treatment options were approved by a
team of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and
neurosurgeons and were performed after patients provided written informed consent.
Of 420 patients, 399 patients were divided into 4 biological subtypes based on the expression of estrogen (ER
[dilution scale 1:100, Klon, 6F11; Novocastra]), progesterone (PgR [dilution scale 1:200, Klon 16, Novocastra]),
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2
[Polyclonal Hercep Test; Dako]) receptors. Twenty-one
patients were unassigned because of insufficient tumor
material for assay. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to evaluate levels of ER, PgR, and HER2 expression. IHC staining was performed on tissue sections that
were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary
breast tumors. Staining was performed using primary
antibodies against ER (Klon, 6F11; Novocastra; Lab
Vision Polska) (dilution scale 1:100), PgR (Klon 16,
Novocastra) (dilution scale 1:200), and HER2 (Polyclonal Hercep Test; Dako; Dako Polska). For the evaluation
of ER and PgR expression, the Allred score was used. All
cases classified as proportion score 3, 4, and 5 were considered as positive regardless of the outcome of the intensity
score; all cases with 10% stained cancer nuclei were classified as positive. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) was used for all HER2 2þ tumors using the PathCancer

September 15, 2010

Vysion HER2 DNA Probe Kit (Vysis PathVysion Kit;
Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). HER2-positive
staining was defined as IHC 3þ or, in the case of IHC
2þ, FISH positivity. HER2 negativity was defined as
IHC 0, 1þ, or 2þ, along with negative FISH results. All
ICH and FISH assays were performed in 1 institution by
a team of pathologists involved in breast cancer research.
Patients were divided into 4 biological subtypes as
1) triple-negative (ER negative, PgR negative, and HER2
negative), 2) HER2 (HER2 positive, ER negative, and
PgR negative), 3) luminal B (HER2 positive, ER positive,
and/or PgR positive), and 4) luminal A (ER positive and/
or PgR positive, HER2 negative). Triple-negative and
luminal A subsets were HER2 negative. HER2 and luminal B subsets were HER2 positive.
Survival calculated from brain metastases was analyzed in all patients, in 4 biological subgroups, and in 3 recursive partitioning analysis of Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group (RPA RTOG) prognostic classes. Class
I included patients aged <65 years, with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score of 70, with controlled disease at the primary site, and without metastases outside
the brain. Prognostic class III was comprised of patients
with a KPS <70, regardless of other factors, whereas prognostic class II included all the remaining patients.8 The
analysis of survival from brain metastases depending on
systemic treatment after WBRT was a special goal of the
study. Patients with triple-negative and luminal A subtypes were divided into 2 subgroups: those treated and not
treated with chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy after
WBRT. Patients with HER2 and luminal B subtypes
were divided into 3 groups: those not treated after
WBRT, those treated with chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, and treated with chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy with targeted therapy.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to determine patient demographics and clinical characteristics. All tests of hypotheses were conducted at the a ¼.05 level with a 95%
confidence interval (95% CI). To compare categorical
tumor features in the 4 biological subgroups of patients,
the chi-square test was used. For those categorical variables in which the chi-square test was inappropriate
because of small numbers, the Fisher exact test was used.
Survival rates from the detection of brain metastases were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared
using the log-rank test.

To determine factors influencing survival from
brain metastases, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses
were performed. The following factors were included in
the univariate analysis: KPS (70 vs <70), age (40 years
vs <40 years, and 65 years vs <65 years), number of
brain metastases (1 vs 2 and 1 vs multiple), localization of
brain metastases in the brain (infratentorial vs supratentorial), biological subtype of breast cancer (triple-negative vs
luminal A and triple-negative vs HER2 with luminal B),
locoregional disease recurrence (yes vs no), lung metastases (yes vs no), liver metastases (yes vs no), bone metastases
(yes vs no), controlled extracranial disease (yes vs no), and
systemic treatment after WBRT (yes vs no). Factors that
were found to be significant in univariate analysis were
examined in the multivariate model. To obtain the final
multivariate model, a forward stepwise procedure was
used with a P value for removal >.1. The proportional
hazard assumption in the final model was tested using
Schoenfeld residuals.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Treatment
Brain metastases were detected on magnetic resonance
imaging (408 of 420 patients; 97%) or computed tomography (12 of 420 patients; 3%). WBRT was performed
in 411 patients (411 of 420 patients; 98%) using a 4 to
6-megavolt photon beam by 2 lateral opposed standard
fields covering all intracranial contents. The most common regimen of WBRT was 30 grays (Gy) in 10 fractions. Nine patients (9 of 420 patients; 2%) were not
irradiated due to poor KPS at the time of the diagnosis
of brain metastases. All irradiated patients were treated
with corticosteroids in the course of WBRT. Sixty-nine
patients (69 of 420 patients; 16%) with 1 or 2 brain metastases underwent surgery before WBRT. Systemic
treatment after WBRT was ordered in 297 (297 of 420
patients; 71%) patients. The majority of these patients
(249 of 297 patients; 84%) received chemotherapy.
Schedules with vinorelbine and capecitabine were the
most frequent types of chemotherapy used. Hormonal
therapy was used in 23% of patients (69 of 297
patients). Aromatase inhibitors were the most frequently
ordered. Targeted therapy (trastuzumab or lapatinib)
was ordered in 47% (105 of 223 patients) of all HER2positive patients in the study. Clinical characteristics
and type of systemic treatment after WBRT are presented in Table 1.

Pattern of Metastatic Spread Depending on
Biological Subtype
In the group of 399 patients with brain metastases, the
luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple-negative subtypes
accounted for 81 (20%), 92 (23%), 120 (30%), and 106
(27%) of cases, respectively. Breast cancers from particular biological subtypes varied depending on the pattern of
metastatic spread. In patients with HER2-positive breast
cancer (HER2 and luminal B subtypes), metastases in
many organs (lung, liver, bone, and soft tissue) were
detected and brain metastases appeared after the dissemination to other organs. In patients with the luminal A subtype, the bones and lungs were the most frequent sites of
metastasis. In approximately one-third of patients with
triple-negative breast cancer, brain metastases developed
as a first or the only distant event. They could also appear
after lung metastases. The frequency of clinicopathologic
variables within the 4 biological subsets is presented inTable 2.
Survival
Median time of prospective observation measured from
the detection of brain metastases was 2.9 years (95% CI,
1.68-4.18 years).
The median survival calculated from brain metastases in the entire group was 8 months (luminal A, 10
months; luminal B, 9 months; HER2, 9 months; and
triple-negative, 4 months; P ¼ .0005).
The median survival calculated from brain metastases in RPA RTOG prognostic classes I, II, and III was
15 months, 11 months, and 3 months, respectively
(P < .0001).
In the entire group, the median survival from brain
metastases in patients without and with systemic treatment after WBRT was 3 months and 10 months, respectively (P < .0001). Survival from brain metastases
depending on systemic treatment is presented in Figure 1.
In the group of patients with luminal A breast cancer, the median survival without and with systemic therapy was 3 months and 12 months, respectively (P ¼
.003). In the group of patients with the luminal B subtype, the median survival without further treatment, after
chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, and after chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy with targeted therapy
was 2 months, 9 months, and 15 months, respectively
(P < .0001). In patients with the HER2 breast cancer subtype, the median survival without further treatment, after
chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, and after chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy with targeted therapy

was 4 months, 6 months, and 13 months, respectively
(P < .0001). In patients with triple-negative breast cancer,
the median survival without and with chemotherapy was
3 months and 4 months, respectively (P ¼ .16). The
results are presented in Table 3 and in Figure 2.
Factors Influencing Survival After WBRT
The Cox multivariate analysis confirmed the following
factors as influencing survival: KPS, number of brain metastases, biological subtype of breast cancer, locoregional
disease recurrence, liver metastases, control of extracranial
disease, and systemic treatment after WBRT. Patients
with good KPS, with 1 brain metastasis, without locoregional failure and distant metastases or with controlled
extracranial disease, with a biological subtype other than
triple-negative, and who were treated systemically after
WBRT were found to survive longer. In contrast to this
finding, poor KPS, multiple brain metastases, triple-negative breast cancer subtype, disseminated uncontrolled disease, and lack of systemic treatment after WBRT were
factors found to worsen survival. Patients treated systemically after WBRT had a risk of death that was 3 times
lower than patients without further treatment. The results
of multivariate analysis are presented in Table 4.

DISCUSSION
The goal of the current study was to build on our previous
work and explore the prognostic influence of systemic
therapy after WBRT for patients with brain metastases

4242

from breast cancer in a subtype-specific manner. A group
of breast cancer patients with brain metastases who were
treated at 1 institution during a relatively short period of
time using similar, modern methods of treatment was analyzed. To our knowledge, it is the largest group of
patients with breast cancer brain metastases in whom the
role of systemic treatment after WBRT within biological
subgroups has been assessed.
Gene expression profiling divides breast cancer into
several distinct diseases with heterogeneous expression of
ER, PgR, and HER2 receptors as well as different
responses to treatment and outcomes.9 Basal-like and
HER2-positive tumors are more likely to metastasize to
the brain, and they have the worst prognosis.10 Without
being able to perform gene expression profiling, we have
defined subsets of patients based on the expression of ER,
PgR, and HER2 receptors, which were proposed by Hugh
et al.11 Metastatic pattern and propensity of biological
subtypes to the brain, observed in our study, were discussed elsewhere.6 We have observed a good response to
hormonal therapy in the luminal A patient subset and to
chemotherapy with targeted therapy in the HER2-positive breast cancer patients (those with HER2 and luminal
B subtypes). We have not achieved satisfactory results
with the systemic treatment in patients with triple-negative breast cancers. This suggests that triple-negative
breast cancer is a distinct and very aggressive biological
subtype. Our observations are in agreement with the data
that have already been published.5,12,13

The results of the current study confirmed that IHC
enables us to divide breast cancer patients into biological
subtypes with different prognosis and prediction outcomes. With regard to the lack of gene expression profiling, it should be a useful surrogate in everyday clinical
practice.
It is difficult to determine whether systemic treatment ordered after WBRT prolongs survival due to control of extracranial disease only or whether it influences
cerebral disease as well. In patients with breast cancer and
brain metastases, disease progression at other organs is often observed.5,6,14 Therefore, there is a need for the introduction or continuation of systemic therapy after WBRT

previous studies, concerning patients with breast cancer
and brain metastases and patients with leptomeningeal

metastases, revealed that improvement in survival after
systemic therapy could be attributed mainly to the control
of extracranial disease14 and that systemic treatment was

The activity of systemic drugs in relation to brain
lesions remains unclear, and this clinical issue is still unresolved. It appears that some chemotherapeutics and hormonal agents can reach the brain tumor, because in
patients with brain metastases, the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) is in part disrupted. WBRT additionally increases
its permeability. To the best of our knowledge, the role of
systemic treatment in the management of brain metastases
has been explored in a very limited number of controlled
comparative trials. These studies have been conducted
mostly in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Among
10 clinical trials assessing the role of chemotherapy in the
management of patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases,16 only 1 applies to patients with breast cancer.17
In this study, the role of temozolomide was assessed. In
patients in whom temozolomide was ordered after
WBRT, the benefit observed in the response rate within
the brain was achieved, but without the influence on survival noted. Temozolomide does not appear to play an
active role in the treatment of brain metastases from breast
cancer.
Some retrospective studies have evaluatee the
response to various chemotherapeutic drugs in brain metastases from breast cancer. These regimens were considered either before or after WBRT in patients with newly
diagnosed metastatic breast cancer to the brain, particularly in the presence of active systemic disease. An objective response rate after cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil,
methotrexate, epirubicin, cisplatin, and etoposide was
achieved in 38% to 55% of patients, and the median survival time was 7 to 13 months.3,18
In the current study, the majority of patients were
heavily pretreated before the detection of brain metastases.
Vinorelbine and capecitabine were used most frequently.
Both are effective in patients with dissemination to the

viscera, but to the best of our knowledge, little is known
concerning its efficacy to the brain. Capecitabine as a
single agent has been shown to have activity in small series
of breast cancer patients with recurrent brain metastases.19-21 Three of 7 patients demonstrated a complete
response and 3 achieved stable disease, with a median
overall and progression-free survival after treatment of 13
months and 8 months, respectively.22 The combination
of capecitabine and temozolomide demonstrated a clinical
response in patients who recurred after WBRT.23 To our
knowledge, data regarding the efficacy of vinorelbine in
the treatment of breast cancer brain metastases are also
scarce. In the study of Omuro et al, no response was
achieved after a combination of temozolomide with vinorelbine for brain metastases, however, only 6 of the 21 cases
were breast cancer patients.24
In recent years, targeted therapies with the use of
trastuzumab and lapatinib have been increasingly investigated in patients with breast cancer metastases to the
brain. A retrospective analysis of patients’ data has been
performed to evaluate the effect of trastuzumab on survival in patients with brain metastases. In some studies,
overall survival from the time of diagnosis of brain metastases was compared between patients with HER2-positive
disease who received trastuzumab and patients with either
HER2-positive or HER2-negative disease who did not.
The studies confirmed that, in HER2-positive breast cancer patients with brain metastases, trastuzumab treatment
that continued after WBRT prolonged survival due to
control of extracranial disease. The median survival from
the time of the diagnosis of brain metastases in patients
treated with trastuzumab ranged from 12 to 24.9
months.25-29 In the current study, approximately half of
HER2-positive breast cancer patients continued to receive
trastuzumab after WBRT. The median survival after

chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy with targeted
therapy was 13 months for breast cancer patients with the
HER2 subtype and 15 months for those with the luminal
B subtype. This result was even better than that observed
in patients with the luminal A subtype of breast cancer
(12 months), which is known as a subset with the best
prognosis. We believe that, in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, targeted therapy added to chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy has an additional impact on
survival and should be continued after the detection of
brain metastases.
Lapatinib is the second targeted drug investigated in
patients with brain metastases from breast cancer, but to
the best of our knowledge, only modest activity of this
drug was assessed.30 In the current study, only 9 patients
were treated with lapatinib after progression to trastuzumab, so it was difficult to assess the efficacy of this drug in
the current group of patients.
Conclusions
Systemic treatment ordered after WBRT appears to
improve survival in patients with the luminal A, luminal
B, and HER2 subtypes of breast cancer. Targeted therapy
was found to have an additional positive impact on survival. The role of systemic treatment after WBRT in triple-negative breast cancer cannot be clearly defined, and
therefore there is a need for more prospective data targeting this patient population. We are of the opinion that, in
breast cancer patients with brain and extracranial metastases, systemic therapy should be continued after local treatment (WBRT, surgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery).
Even if systemic therapy after WBRT affects only extracranial disease, the results of trastuzumab therapy, not
crossing the BBB, indicate that visceral regression can prolong survival. However, prospective randomized trials
that include a homogenous group of breast cancer patients
with brain metastases are needed to assess the response
rate of systemic treatment in the brain and in the viscera
and to evaluate the causes of death. Improvements in systemic therapy for triple-negative breast cancer are urgently
needed.
