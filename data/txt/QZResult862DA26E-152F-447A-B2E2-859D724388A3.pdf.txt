Implications of Key Trials in Advanced
Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer
Philip D. Bonomi, MD

Many different targeted therapies with varying mechanisms of action have been added to standard first-line chemotherapy doublets in an effort to improve survival of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Only
2 targeted therapies—bevacizumab and cetuximab—have been associated with superior survival in phase 3 first-line
studies. For both agents, the decision to enter phase 3 was based on results from randomized phase 2 trials, unlike
other targeted therapies where the decision was made using either phase 1 or single study arm phase 2 results. There
is also mounting evidence that patient selection will play a key role in the successful development of any targeted
agent. Bevacizumab is indicated for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who do not have certain comorbidities. Use
of cetuximab is not restricted by safety factors, but may be focused on patients whose tumors are epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent; whether EGFR expression or absence of KRAS mutations are appropriate markers
is still under study. By including randomized phase 2 trials in the development pathway, and by improving patient
selection for individual agents (enriching trials with patients most likely to respond), it may be possible to enhance
the success rate of future phase 3 clinical trials and, in turn, define future clinical practice with improved patient outC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Lung cancer is the second most common malignancy in both men and women in the United States, and the leading
cause of cancer death. In 2008, an estimated 215,000 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer, representing 15% of all
cancer diagnoses, and 161,840 people will die from it, accounting for 28.6% of all cancer deaths.1 Approximately 85% of
the cases are classified as nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which comprises a heterogeneous group of histologies,
including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.2 The high cancer death rate reflects the
large percentage of cases diagnosed at an advanced stage as well as the plateau in effect achieved with cytotoxic chemotherapy in this setting. Historically, platinum doubletsÅwith taxanes, antimetabolites, or vinca agentsÅhave exhibited the best
activity in advanced NSCLC, with objective response rates of 20% to 30% and median survival of 8 to 10 months.3,4
Although doublet chemotherapy significantly improves response rates and 1-year survival compared with single-agent
therapy, a meta-analysis showed that adding a third cytotoxic agent produces only a small increase in response rate and no
improvement in survival compared with the doublet.5
Recent efforts to improve outcome in NSCLC have focused on numerous targeted therapeutic approaches. Unfortunately, nearly all phase 3 studies in which a targeted therapy was added to first-line chemotherapy have had only limited
success6-18 (Table 1). Many of these agents—including the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor prinomastat, the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, the retinoid X receptor modulator bexarotene, and the protein kinase C-alpha antisense oligonucleotide aprinocarsen—were evaluated in 2 phase 3 studies, 1 in
combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin and the other in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin. Adding these agents
failed to improve overall survival (OS) or measures of disease progression compared with chemotherapy alone. In many
cases, toxicity was increased. Moreover, recent press releases from study sponsors indicate that phase 3 trials with the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and cediranib were stopped early, because interim analyses showed no survival benefit or
increased toxicity compared with chemotherapy alone.19,20 Taken together, this largely negative body of evidence may

advanced NSCLC setting.

Challenges in Clinical Development of Drugs
for NSCLC
The decision of whether to initiate phase 3 clinical testing
is a critical developmental milestone. Several key factors
are coming to light at this go-no-go decision point for targeted therapies in NSCLC. The first issue is the heterogeneity of the disorder. NSCLC encompasses a number of
histologies: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma,
large cell carcinoma, and several less prevalent entities.21
Moreover, within each histologic subtype, several variants
have been identified. The molecular events leading to the
development of each histological form are not necessarily
the same; consequently, certain therapies may influence
response and outcome differently depending on NSCLC
histology. For example, pemetrexed/cisplatin was as effec-

1156

tive as gemcitabine/cisplatin in first-line treatment of
advanced NSCLC in a phase 3 trial involving 1725
patients.22 Median survival with each regimen was 10.3
months. However, survival differed depending on histologic type: pemetrexed/cisplatin produced significantly
longer survival than gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with
adenocarcinoma (12.6 vs 10.9 months, P ¼ .03) and
large-cell carcinoma (10.4 vs 6.7 months, P ¼ .03),
whereas gemcitabine/cisplatin was favored in patients with
squamous cell histology (9.4 vs 10.8 months, P ¼ .05).
Most cases of NSCLC occur in current or former
smokers, although approximately 10% of patients are
never smokers whose disease may have a unique pathogenic and molecular etiology.23 Somatic activating mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain—found in a
small minority of NSCLC patients—have been detected
more frequently in never smokers than in those with a
smoking history.24,25 These activating mutations confer
sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib
and erlotinib. In subset analyses from the phase 3 trials,
response rates and survival with erlotinib were greater in

the never smokers than in past or current smokers.14,26,27
Other demographic factors, such as sex and ethnicity, may
influence response rates, but have not been shown to affect
survival.
Second, traditional endpoints may not always be
suitable to assess how biologic activity translates into clinical efficacy for targeted therapies. The objective response
rate with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab
was only 4.5% when it was used as a single agent in a
phase 2 study of 66 patients with recurrent NSCLC.28 In
the subset with EGFR-positive tumors, the response rate
was 5%. It is more important to determine whether a targeted therapy enhances response rate and progression-free
survival (PFS) to chemotherapy. In this regard, adding
cetuximab to cisplatin/vinorelbine enhanced response
rates (35% vs 28%) and prolonged PFS (5.0 vs 4.6
months) compared with chemotherapy alone in a
randomized phase 2 study of 86 patients with previously
untreated advanced NSCLC.29 Comparable results were
obtained in another randomized phase 2 study when
cetuximab was added to gemcitabine/platinum.30
The reliability of surrogate clinical endpoints for efficacy is another important issue to consider. Unlike
advanced colorectal or breast cancer, where survival times
surpass 2 years, overall survival in NSCLC once the disease enters advanced stage hovers around the 10-to-12month benchmark. Given this relatively short survival period, the limited effect of second- or third-line therapies
and the aggressive nature of the disease, OS is still considered the gold standard to assess clinical efficacy in clinical
trials in first-line NSCLC. However, to optimize clinical
trial designs, it is valuable to consider the relative robustness of surrogates. Buyse and colleagues evaluated whether
PFS could be used as a surrogate for OS in clinical trials of
advanced NSCLC.31 They conducted a pooled analysis
using data from 2838 patients in 7 randomized clinical
trials that compared docetaxel-based therapy versus vinca
alkaloid-based therapy in the first-line NSCLC setting.
Median PFS was 5.5 months and median OS was 10.0
months for the entire cohort. PFS was correlated with OS
(r2 ¼ 0.68), and the effect of treatment on PFS was correlated with the effect of treatment on OS (r2 ¼ 0.83). The
surrogate threshold effect was a PFS hazard ratio of 0.70,
which indicated that a 30% risk reduction in terms of PFS
predicts a significant effect of treatment on OS. Therefore, if a drug reduces the PFS hazard by at least 30%, it
warrants further investigation in a phase 3 trial with the
expectation that it has a relatively good chance of providing a survival benefit.

Third, the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 needs
to be optimized. In each of the negative clinical studies
listed in Table 1, the decision to conduct the phase 3 trial
was based on results from either phase 1 or single study
arm phase 2 studies. For example, the decision to evaluate
gefitinib in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin
was based on a small phase 1 study of 24 patients with
chemotherapy-naı̈ve advanced NSCLC (as well as studies
of single-agent gefitinib after failure of first-line chemotherapy).32 Conversely, positive phase 3 trial results have
been obtained for 2 targeted therapies in first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. These studies will be discussed in the next section, but in both cases, the phase 3
trials were preceded by a randomized phase 2 trial.
A unique randomized discontinuation phase 2
design may be helpful in that it may enrich for patients
with slowly growing disease who may be most likely to
benefit from targeted therapy. In the E2501 study, 342
patients with advanced NSCLC who had failed at least 2
prior chemotherapy regimens were treated with sorafenib
for 2 months.33 Patients who responded to sorafenib continued treatment, whereas those who had progressive disease were withdrawn. Only patients with stable disease
were randomly assigned to continue sorafenib or switched
to placebo and then allowed to return to sorafenib on progression. Preliminary results indicated that patients continuing on sorafenib had higher rates of stable disease 2
months after randomization (29% vs 5%, P ¼ .002) and
longer PFS (3.6 vs 1.9 months, P ¼ .01). This randomized discontinuation design may offer another approach
for determining whether a targeted therapy is effective
before embarking on a large phase 3 study. In the case of
sorafenib, however, interim results from a phase 3 study
indicated that this agent does not enhance survival when
added to first-line paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy.19
Positive Phase 3 Trials: E4599 and FLEX
Despite previous failures, the treatment of advanced
NSCLC has progressed in recent years with the incorporation of the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab and the
anti-EGFR agent cetuximab.34-37
Bevacizumab

E4599 evaluated whether adding bevacizumab—a
monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth
factor—to paclitaxel/carboplatin would improve OS
compared with chemotherapy alone in 878 patients with
advanced NSCLC.34 Chemotherapy was administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles, with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg

given intravenously on Day 1 every 3 weeks until disease
progression. Based on phase 2 trials that had shown unacceptable risks associated with bevacizumab in certain
patient populations, patients with squamous cell tumors,
brain metastases, clinically significant hemoptysis, or poor
performance status (PS) were excluded. Adding bevacizumab significantly improved median OS (12.3 vs 10.3
months; hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92;
P ¼ .003) and PFS (6.2 vs 4.5 months; HR ¼ 0.66; 95%
CI, 0.57-0.77; P < .001) compared with chemotherapy
alone (Table 2). Objective response rates also increased
significantly (35% vs 15%, P < .001 ). The effects of adding bevacizumab were consistent across subgroups defined
by disease stage (IIIB vs IV vs recurrent), weight loss
(<5% vs 5%), and prior radiation therapy. However,
the survival benefit of bevacizumab was seen in males but
not in females and appeared greater in patients <65 years
of age than in older patients.34
The benefit of adding bevacizumab was also
reported in a second phase 3 trial, though the results do
not totally replicate the success of E4599. In AVAiL,
1043 patients with advanced NSCLC were randomly
allocated to receive bevacizumab (either 7.5 or 15 mg/kg)
plus gemcitabine/cisplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin alone.35
The eligibility criteria were similar to E4599; thus, these
2 trials have defined the population of patients that are

1158

candidates for bevacizumab therapy. Unlike E4599,
where OS was the primary endpoint, AVAiL defined PFS
as the primary endpoint. Compared with the chemotherapy group (median PFS, 6.1 months), adding bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg (6.7 months; HR ¼ 0.75; 95% CI, 0.620.90; P ¼ .0026) or 15 mg/kg (6.5 months; HR ¼ 0.82;
95% CI, 0.68-0.98; P ¼ .0301) significantly prolonged
PFS, but the magnitude of the effect was smaller than
that seen in E4599. Response rates were also increased
significantly by both doses of bevacizumab (34% and
30% vs 20%, P < .0001 and P ¼ .0017, respectively).
OS was not significantly different between bevacizumab
plus gemcitabine/cisplatin versus chemotherapy alone
(HR ¼ 0.92 for 7.5 mg/kg and 1.02 for 15 mg/kg).38
It is unclear why the results seen with AVAiL are not
as robust as those reported in E4599. One obvious difference between the 2 studies is the chemotherapy regimen.
Although antiangiogenic therapy may be expected to
potentiate both regimens similarly, that may not necessarily be the case. Other potential factors that could contribute to differing results between studies, such as patient
demographics, disease stage, and tumor histology, did not
differ appreciably between the 2 trials. However, the duration of treatment in the bevacizumab study arms was longer in E4599 than in AVAiL. Overall, patients in the
chemotherapy study arms of both trials received a median

of 5 cycles. In E4599, patients in the bevacizumab study
arm received a median of 7 cycles, whereas patients in the
low-dose and high-dose bevacizumab study arms of
AVAiL received a median of 6 and 5 cycles, respectively.34,35 However, this difference in treatment duration
may be a secondary manifestation of the difference in PFS
rather than a primary factor contributing to the magnitude of the effect on PFS.

Cetuximab

FLEX evaluated the benefit of adding cetuximab to
cisplatin/vinorelbine in 1125 patients with advanced
NSCLC who were selected on the basis of having EGFRexpressing tumors detected by immunohistochemistry,
which was defined as staining in at least 1 cell (85% of the
screened patients were deemed eligible).36 Chemotherapy
was administered every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles; cetuximab was administered at an initial dose of 400 mg/m2
and then weekly at 250 mg/m2 until disease progression.
The randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0-1 vs 2)
and disease stage (wet IIIB vs IV). Unlike the phase 3 trials
involving bevacizumab, patients with squamous cell carcinoma, brain metastases, and PS 2 were trial eligible. The
study cohort had a median age of 59 years (range, 18 to
83 years); most were male (70%), and had good PS (83%)
and stage IV disease (94%). One third of the patients had
squamous cell carcinomas. Patients in both groups
received a median of 4 cycles of chemotherapy, with
cetuximab administered for a median of 18 weeks.36
Adding cetuximab to cisplatin/vinorelbine significantly improved median OS—the primary study endpoint—compared with chemotherapy alone (11.3 vs 10.1
months; HR ¼ 0.871; 95% CI, 0.762-0.996; P ¼ .044)
(Table 2). This survival benefit was seen across all prespecified subgroups based on PS, smoking status, histology,
sex, age, and tumor stage. Cetuximab also significantly
increased the response rate (36% vs 29%, P ¼ .012), but
did not influence PFS as assessed by the investigator (4.8
months in both study arms). Asian patients accounted for
10.8% of the study cohort,and had a significantly better
prognosis than Caucasian patients (median OS, 19.5 vs
9.6 months). Adding cetuximab did not improve survival
in the Asian subgroup, although this conclusion must be
tempered by the small sample size, as well as differences
between treatment arms in this subgroup. However, adding cetuximab improved survival in the large cohort of
946 Caucasian patients compared with chemotherapy

alone (10.5 vs 9.1 months; HR ¼ 0.803; 95% CI, 0.6940.928; P ¼ .003).36
Despite the positive results in FLEX, the results
from another phase 3 trial (BMS099) with cetuximab
were inconclusive.37 Patients were randomly assigned to
receive cetuximab in combination with a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel, at the discretion of the investigator)
and carboplatin, or chemotherapy alone. The randomization was stratified by taxane, ECOG PS (0 vs 1), and study
site. The primary endpoint was PFS as determined by an
independent radiology review committee. Eligibility criteria were similar to those used in FLEX, except that EGFR
testing was not required. The study cohort had a median
age of 64 years (range, 37 to 87 years)—somewhat older
than the cohort in FLEX—and included a smaller percentage of male patients (59% vs 70% in FLEX), never
smokers (8% vs 22%), squamous cell carcinomas (19.5%
vs 34%), and PS2 patients (1% vs 17%).
The BMS099 study showed that adding cetuximab
increased the objective response rate (25.7% vs 17.2%,
P ¼ .0066), but it found no difference between treatments
in median PFS as determined by the independent radiology review committee (4.40 vs 4.24 months; HR ¼
0.902; 95% CI, 0.761-1.069; P ¼ .236). However, PFS
as assessed by the investigators showed that adding cetuximab significantly improved PFS compared with chemotherapy alone (4.30 vs 3.78 months; HR ¼ 0.766; 95%
CI, 0.649-0.903; P ¼ .0015). Notably, the independent
radiology review committee and investigators agreed on
progression in only 70% of the cases.37
It is tempting to speculate that the investigator
assessment of progression may have been more accurate
or more clinically meaningful to survival than that made
by the independent radiology review committee. On
examining their patients, investigators may conclude
that disease has progressed if PS declines by 2 levels or if
pain requiring radiation develops—both of which, in my
opinion, should be included in the definition of progression. In comparison, the independent radiology review
committee discerns progression based solely on radiology findings. In addition, censoring patients who died
without evidence of anatomic progression versus classifying them as progressors could influence the relationship
between PFS and OS. After longer follow-up, the OS
analysis revealed a numeric advantage with cetuximab
consistent with the difference seen in the FLEX study,
but that did not reach statistical significance (median
OS, 9.69 vs 8.38 months; HR ¼ 0.89, 95% CI; 0.751.05; P ¼ .17).39

In light of the body of evidence (both negative and positive) across all these trials in advanced NSCLC, the question remains: what have we learned about the integration
of these agents in practice? And how can we improve
future clinical development strategies?

Current Patient Selection

Patient selection is emerging as the paramount factor in the successful use of targeted therapies in NSCLC
and beyond. Bevacizumab is currently indicated for use in
combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin for first-line
treatment of patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC based on results
from E4599.40 Because of safety concerns, patients with
predominant squamous cell histology, brain metastases,
gross hemoptysis, or unstable angina and those receiving
therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded from E4599
and are not usually treated with bevacizumab40 (Table 3).
However, preliminary evidence from an open-label study
(SAiL), an observational cohort study (ARIES), and other
ongoing studies (ATLAS, PASSPORT) suggest that bevacizumab may be suitable for use in patients with treated,
asymptomatic brain metastases without causing undue
risk of central nervous system hemorrhage.41-43 Moreover, these preliminary data suggest that bevacizumab
may be safe in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy
and does not impair management of hypertension in
patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive
medication.42,44
On the basis of FLEX, it is tempting to speculate
that cetuximab will be used in patients with EGFRexpressing tumors, without the risk-related restrictions
applied to bevacizumab. Thus, the use of cetuximab
would not be limited by NSCLC histology or the presence
of brain metastases (Table 3). The immediate beneficiaries, therefore, could be those who are not considered eligible for bevacizumab therapy, although other selection
criteria (see below) could optimize the identification of
patients for cetuximab therapy.
Integrating Both Bevacizumab and Cetuximab

The positive phase 3 results with bevacizumab and
cetuximab have prompted several ongoing phase 2 trials to
explore the feasibility of administering both targeted therapies in combination with chemotherapy. The Southwest
Oncology Group (SWOG) tested paclitaxel 200 mg/m2,
carboplatin AUC ¼ 6, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q3wk

in combination with the standard dosing schedule of
cetuximab (400 mg/m2 on Day 1, 250 mg/m2 weekly
thereafter) in 104 patients in a single study arm phase 2
trial. Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg and cetuximab 250 mg/m2
were continued until progression.45 The response rate was
48%, and toxicity was considered acceptable. Based on the
results of their single study arm phase 2 trial,45 SWOG is
planning a phase 3 study comparing paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab versus these 3 agents plus cetuximab.
Paclitavel-carboplatin plus the antibody doublet are
also being tested in an open-label randomized trial,
patients with nonsquamous advanced NSCLC and good
PS are being allocated to receive paclitaxel/carboplatin every 3 weeks for either 3 or 6 cycles. Both treatment arms
receive a standard schedule of cetuximab until disease progression, plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on Day 8 of each
cycle for 6 cycles. PFS is being evaluated as the primary
endpoint, with OS, response rate, and safety as secondary
endpoints. Planned accrual is 120 patients, with study
completion expected in March 2009.46
Improving Patient Selection for Future Trials

As our understanding of the heterogeneity of this disease grows, the positive results of trials that enrolled ‘‘allcomers’’ no longer serve as terminal points of clinical development, but rather as initial steps toward optimal clinical
use of these agents. The key to future development of targeted therapies is likely to be patient selection, with the goal
of enriching the study cohort for patients most likely to
respond to the experimental agent. This objective may be
approached by using clinical trial or patient registry data to

compare outcomes for various subgroups stratified by demographics, tumor characteristics, or molecular markers.
Consider tumor histology as an example. As noted previously, advanced NSCLC patients with adenocarcinomas or
large-cell carcinomas had longer median OS with pemetrexed/cisplatin than gemcitabine/cisplatin, whereas the
opposite was true for patients with squamous cell carcinomas.22 In this case, tumor histology can be used to guide
selection between these chemotherapy regimens. Moreover,
evidence that patients with certain tumor histology may be
prone to serious adverse events can lead to excluding that
subgroup, as in the case of increased risk of hemorrhagic
events with bevacizumab in patients with squamous cell
carcinomas.47 Therefore, patients with squamous cell histology were excluded from further clinical evaluation.
However, once a survival advantage is established, new clinical studies or observational cohorts can be used to reassess
whether certain risk factors should continue to be used to
exclude patients from treatment. This approach, as noted
above, is currently being used for bevacizumab.41-44
By identifying those most likely to respond to targeted therapy, molecular markers may offer the greatest
promise for improving success rate in the clinical development of new targeted agents. Consider the case of antiEGFR agents. Increased EGFR copy number measured by
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is found in 40%
to 60% of advanced NSCLC tumors.26,48-50 Patients with
FISH-positive tumors achieved significantly longer
PFS (6 vs 3 months, P ¼ .0011) and OS (15 vs 7 months,
P ¼ .046) when treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy than FISH-negative patients.49 However, EGFR gene
copy number predicted longer time to progression but
not improved survival when erlotinib was added to paclitaxel/carboplatin in a subset of patients in TRIBUTE.48
After failure of first-line chemotherapy, high EGFR copy
number as well as EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry were associated with improved survival with
single-agent erlotinib compared with placebo in the
BR.21 trial.26,50 In contrast to the setting of salvage therapy with an EGFR TKI versus placebo, high EGFR copy
number did not have predictive value for survival in
patients treated with second-line gefitinib versus docetaxel.51 Additional data are needed to determine the predictive value of EGFR gene copy number in patients
treated with EGFR inhibitors.
EGFR mutations are found in 13%-22% of NSCLC
patients and have been associated with improved response
rate but not improved survival to erlotinib and gefitinib.26,50,52 Results from the IPASS trial have shown that

Cancer

EGFR mutations have significant predictive value in
Asians with previously untreated stage IV NSCLC.53
Approximately 1200 patients were randomized to gefitinib or to paclitaxel-carboplatin. Eligibility requirements
included a history of never smoking or remote light smoking and adenocarcinoma histology. Despite the finding
that these clinical featues along with Asian ethnicity are
associated with a higher response rate to EGFR tyrosine
Kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer PFS in patients with wild type EGFR
(HR ¼ 2, 85; P < 0:001). In contrast, superior progression free survival was observed with gefitinib in patients
who had EGFR mutations. The results of the IPASS trial
appear to validate the value of EGFR mutations in predicting PFS in the NSCLC first-line treatment setting53
Analysis of OS is ongoing.
KRAS mutations are found in 15%-20% of patients
with advanced NSCLC.50,52 Patients with KRAS mutations showed lower response rates and shorter survival
than those with wild type KRAS in response to erlotinib
plus chemotherapy in the TRIBUTE trial and singleagent erlotinib in the BR.21 trial.50,52 Similarly, data
from a patient registry of 5 clinical trials performed in the
United States and Europe indicated that KRAS mutations
confer resistance to EGFR TKI therapy.54 Although these
observations suggest that EGFR TKIs have less effect in
tumors with KRAS mutations, there is no significant difference in survival between gefitinib and docetaxel when
used for second-line treatment of NSCLC in patients
with KRAS mutated tumors.51 KRAS mutations are associated with resistance to cetuximab and poorer survival in
advanced colorectal patients;55,56 however, preliminary
analyses based on the limited amount of samples collected
in BMS099 indicated that that may not be the case in
NSCLC.57 Consequently, the predictive value of KRAS
mutations with respect to survival and anti-EGFR antibodies cannot be elucidated.
For new targeted therapies, the mechanism of action
should first be defined as clearly as possible in preclinical
models, and then their single-agent activity should be
tested in clinical trials, with blood and tissue specimens
stored for future molecular profiling. As new and potentially relevant markers are identified, the stored specimens
can be tested to help refine patient selection criteria for
future clinical trials in not only the advanced disease setting but also subsequently locally advanced disease and
finally in the adjuvant setting. The development of the
anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab for breast
cancer illustrates this point. Patients with metastatic breast

1161

Review Article

cancer who had high HER2 expression were found to
respond best to this agent, and, consequently, high HER2
expression was carried forward as an eligibility criterion in
clinical trials conducted in locally advanced disease and in
adjuvant therapy.58
Other Issues

The dose and administration schedule need to be
optimized to ensure that drug is delivered to the site of
action and to produce drug concentrations above those
necessary to inhibit the molecular target without causing
unacceptable toxicity. These factors should be addressed
early in the clinical development program, in phase 1
studies or with preoperative and postoperative molecular
pharmacodynamic profiles in early stage patients treated
with novel agents before surgery. Ideally, this information
should be available before starting randomized phase 2
and phase 3 trials.
The use of maintenance therapy in patients whose
disease is controlled on first-line chemotherapy is another
consideration. In each of these randomized trials, patients
with disease control on a platinum doublet were assigned
to immediate treatment with a different single agent on to
secondary treatment at the time of disease progression.59,60 There is considerable controversy regarding routine use of maintenance therapy in stage IV disease. One
possible explanation for the lack of consensus includes the
wish of some physicians to provide a treatment holiday
for incurable patients. Another explanation might be
related to inherent weaknesses in the design of these studies. The docetaxel maintenance trial59 did not include a
placebo study arm, while treatment with pemetrexed was
not required at the time of disease progression for observation patients in the other maintenance study.60
In a phase 3 trial of patients with advanced NSCLC
who did not progress on first-line gemcitabine/carboplatin, docetaxel was started either immediately after chemotherapy as a maintenance therapy or delayed until disease
progression.59 Immediate treatment with docetaxel significantly improved PFS (6.5 vs 3.8 months, P < .0001), but
produced only a trend for better OS (11.9 vs 9.1 months)
compared with the delayed approach. Maintenance pemetrexed following a platinum doublet has also been associated with superior PFS (HR ¼ 0.444; P ¼ .00,001) in
patients with nonsquamous tumors.60 In phase 3 trials of
bevacizumab and cetuximab, these targeted therapies were
continued after chemotherapy until evidence of disease
progression. It is not known whether patients who
respond to initial chemotherapy plus bevacizumab or

1162

cetuximab would benefit from switching immediately to a
different targeted therapy in a maintenance paradigm.
Conclusion
Targeted therapies have been evaluated in an effort to
improve patient outcomes beyond the plateau effect
achieved with chemotherapy doublets in first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. Toward this end, a number of
different targeted therapies with varying mechanisms of
action have been tested, but with limited success. Only 2
targeted therapies—bevacizumab and cetuximab—when
added to first-line chemotherapy have been shown to
extend survival of advanced NSCLC patients. Unlike the
targeted therapies that have produced negative results,
both bevacizumab and cetuximab were tested in combination with chemotherapy in randomized phase 2 trials
before advancing to the pivotal phase 3 stage. Accordingly,
the go-no-go decision to advance to phase 3 should be
based on safety and efficacy data in randomized phase 2
trials rather than phase 1 or single study arm phase 2
studies.
The use of targeted therapies, whether in clinical trials or practice, is currently dictated by eligibility for therapy based on clinical features and demographic factors. In
the future, efforts will focus on ways to enrich study
cohorts with patients who are most likely to respond to
therapy by also considering pathologic features and molecular markers. Improved patient selection is expected to
enhance the success rate in NSCLC clinical trials, and in
turn, define future clinical practice with improved patient
outcomes.
