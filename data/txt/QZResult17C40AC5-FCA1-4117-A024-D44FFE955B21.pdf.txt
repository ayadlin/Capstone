Abstract
B7-H3 is a tumor-associated antigen that plays a critical role in potential tumortargeted therapy. In this study, we aimed to assess the radiobiological effect of
131
I-labeled B7-H3 monoclonal antibody (131I-4H7) in nude mice with human renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) and evaluate the effect of 131I-4H7 on RCC treatment. The
radiobiological activity and tumor uptake of 131I-4H7, and its effect on tumor growth
were measured. 131I-4H7 was absorbed by the tumor and reached its maximal uptake
rate (3.32% injected dose [ID]/g) at 24 h, at which point the drug concentration in
the tumor was 7.36-, 2.06-, 1.80-, and 2.78-fold higher than that in muscle, kidneys,
liver, and heart, respectively. Measurements and positron emission tomography–
computed tomography imaging showed that tumor development was significantly
inhibited by 131I-4H7. HE staining revealed that 131I-4H7 significantly injures tumor
cells. Our results suggest that 131I-4H7 is markedly absorbed by the tumor and did
suppress the development of RCC xenografted tumors in nude mice, which might
provide a new candidate for antibody-mediated targeted radiotherapy in human RCC.

Introduction

surgery. The lack of any demonstrable efficacy from
chemotherapy and radiation therapy in advanced RCC has
led to a 5.0-year survival rate ranging from 5.0 to 10.0%
[9, 10].
B7-H3, a member of the B7 immunoregulatory
family, was identified in 2001 by database searches of a
human dendritic cell-derived cDNA library [11]. B7-H3 is
broadly expressed at the transcriptional level and is found
in a wide spectrum of both human solid tumors and normal
tissues, while at the protein level, B7-H3 can be expressed
in dendritic cells and in the liver, lungs, and prostate as
well as in most tumor cell lines. B7-H3 was identified
as the most differentially expressed cell-surface tumorspecific endothelial marker [12]. Studies have shown that
tumor B7-H3 expression is correlated with poor patient
survival in both clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and urothelial
cell carcinoma [13, 14]. Qin et al. [15]. found that the

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common
malignant tumor in the adult kidney, accounting for 2.03.0% of all human malignancies [1], and its occurrence
has increased in recent years [2-4].The incidence of RCC
worldwide is approximately 209, 000 new cases per year
and 102, 000 deaths per year [5]. In the United States,
it is estimated that there will be ~61, 560 new cases and
14, 080 deaths of kidney and renal pelvis cancer in 2015
[6]. Recent studies have clearly shown that the clear-cell
tumor subtype is the most frequent, accounting for >80%
of all RCCs [7, 8]. Radical surgery is the most effective
treatment option for early stage RCC. Unfortunately, 1525% of patients present with a metastatic disease at the
time of diagnosis and 30% of the localized disease will
relapse into a metastatic setting during the years following

expression of B7-H3 was not only detected in ccRCC
specimens, but was also confirmed in RCC vasculature,
and that the vascular B7-H3 expression was associated
with multiple adverse clinical and pathologic features. In
addition, B7-H3 expression in tumor vasculature was also
correlated with poor survival, suggesting that this ligand
might play an important role in tumor cell migration [15,
16]; therefore, B7-H3 might be a useful target for tumorspecific antiangiogenic therapies [17].
Targeted therapy, which has radically altered
the treatment of late-stage RCC in recent years, relies
on the following two main groups of agents: vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeting drugs and
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors.
Nevertheless, despite recent success, complete response
to antiangiogenic therapies is rare. One study showed
that 80.95% of patients receiving 131I-B7-H3 monoclonal
antibody (8H9) salvage therapy had prolonged survival
times after a central nervous system (CNS) neuroblastoma
relapse [18]. These findings led us to hypothesize that the
specific expression of B7-H3 in the RCC vasculature

system could make it a prominent carrier for B7-H3
image- and receptor-mediated targeted radiotherapy.
Utilizing 131I as a radiotherapeutic nuclide and monoclonal
antibody B7-H3 (4H7) as a carrier, the feasibility and
efficacy of B7-H3-mediated 131I-4H7 targeted radiotherapy
was analyzed in a human RCC xenograft model.

Results
Clinical tissue samples and immunohistochemical
staining
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining analysis
showed significantly more B7-H3 staining in the tumor
cells, tumor vasculatures, and stroma of the ccRCC
samples than in normal renal specimens (Figure 1A-1D),
which was consistent with the previously reported study
results [16].

staining for B7-H3 and the stroma were negative; B.-D. In RCC tissue, B7-H3 was positive staining extensively, including the tumor cells,
vasculature, and the stroma. Representative images are shown (n = 8) (A: ×100, B: ×100, C: ×200, D: ×400).

Its uptake rate also peaked at 24 h, at which point the
drug concentration in the tumor was 5.02-, 1.58-, 1.39-,
1.29-, and 2.09-fold higher than that in muscle, kidneys,
liver, lung and heart, respectively (Figure 3B). 131I-4H7
exhibited 7.39 ± 1.11% ID/g liver uptake compared with
6.36 ± 1.11% ID/g in 131I-mIgG at 2.0 h post-injection
(Figure 3A-3B). 131I-4H7 showed 5.67 ± 0.68% ID/g of
kidney uptake, which is higher than that of 131I-mIgG (4.64
± 0.68% ID/g) at 2.0 h pi (Figure 3A and 3B). It might
be the reason that 4H7 metabolized mainly through the
liver and kidneys. The nonspecific uptake in the muscle
was at a very low level for both tracers. 131I-4H7 exhibited
greater tumor uptake at the early time point and better
tumor retention, indicating a longer circulation time. In
addition, 131I-4H7 showed greater tumor uptake compared
to that of 131I-mIgG, and the 131I-4H7 tumor/kidney ratio
of was significantly higher than that of 131I-mIgG (Figure
3C). Similar tumor/muscle, tumor/liver, and tumor/heart
ratios were observed for both 131I-4H7 and 131I-mIgG
(Figure 3C).

131
I-4H7 and 131I-mIgG were prepared and the
radiochemical purities of both were >95%. The in vitro
stability of 131I-4H7 in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37°C is shown in
Figure 2. After 72 h of incubation, >95% of the 131I-4H7
and 131I-mIgG remained intact in PBS.

Biodistribution studies
Tissue distribution data for 131I-4H7 and 131I-mIgG
in tumor-bearing nude mice are given as the percentage
of administered activity per gram of tissue (%ID/g)
(Figure 3). In vivo biodistribution of injected 131I-4H7 and
131
I-mIgG was examined in these mice.
For 131I-4H7, the tumor uptake was determined to be
2.72 ± 0.49, 2.32 ± 0.77, 2.25 ± 0.69, 3.32 ± 0.46, 1.34 ±
0.20, and 1.13 ± 0.28% ID/g at 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 24, 48, and
72 h, respectively. Its uptake rate peaked at 24 h, at which
point the drug concentration in the tumor was 7.36-, 2.06-,
1.80-, 1.67-, and 2.78-fold higher than that in the muscle,
kidneys, liver, lung and heart, respectively (Figure 3A).
For 131I-mIgG, the tumor uptake was 2.46 ± 0.48, 2.21 ±
1.73, 2.15 ± 0.69, 2.67 ± 0.29, 1.33 ± 0.20, and 1.11 ±
0.28% ID/g at 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively.

Positron emission tomography /computed
tomography (PET-CT) imaging studies
The effect of 131I-4H7, 131I-mIgG, 131I, and saline on
tumor xenograft growth in nude mice was evaluated by

A paired Student’s t test revealed a significant
difference between the group treated with saline and the
groups treated with 131I-4H7 and 131I-mIgG at day 28,
while there was no difference between the saline group
and 131I group. This shows that treatment with 131I-4H7
and 131I-mIgG significantly inhibited tumor growth and
changed the original growth rate of the xenografted
tumors, and that the inhibiting effect was more significant
in the 131I-4H7 group. At day 28, the group treated with
131
I-4H7 showed a 55.19% inhibition of tumor growth
(Supplementary Table 3). There was also a significant
difference between the group injected with 131I-4H7 and
that injected with 131I-mIgG (31.92%) (Supplementary
Table 3), which suggested that 131I-4H7 acted more
significantly to suppress tumor growth than 131I-mIgG.

Effect of 131I-4H7 on tumor xenograft growth
The effect of 131I-4H7, 131I-mIgG, 131I, and saline on
tumor xenograft growth in nude mice is shown in Figure 5
(and Supplementary Table 2). Rapid growth was observed
in the group treated with saline and 131I; the tumors were

7.77 times the size of the original at days 7.0, 14, 21,
and 28, respectively. The growth curves of 131I-4H7 and
131
I-mIgG groups were also different, with tumors reaching
1.46 to 1.66, 2.54 to 2.62, 3.18 to 4.15, and 3.44 to 5.53
times the original size, respectively, at days 7.0, 14, 21,

genetic and molecular alterations underlying the various
recognized histological subtypes. Considering that RCC
possesses multiple drug-resistant genes and is not sensitive
to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, prognosis of
advanced RCC remains poor, with <10% of patients still
living 5.0 years after diagnosis of the metastatic disease [9,
10]. Monoclonal antibodies are often directed toward cellsurface molecules and can be radiolabeled for the imaging
or treatment of cancer and other ailments [19-21].Targeted
agents against VEGF, VEGFR, or mTOR continue to play
a crucial role in the management of metastatic ccRCC
[22].
B7-H3 was discovered firstly by Chen in 2001 [11];
however, the physiological and pathological role of B7-H3
is far less well known and both stimulatory and inhibitory
effects have been described for this ligand. Recent studies
have indicated that B7-H3 overexpression was found in
several tumors, such as prostate cancer, non-small-cell
lung carcinoma, and RCC. In addition, B7-H3 is expressed
in both RCC cells and tumor vessels and was marked as

The saline- and 131I-treated groups were
characterized by well-developed proliferations of ccRCC
cells, with a compact arrangement and diffusely distributed
invading cancer nests; the nuclei were of various sizes and
there was no apparent necrosis in the cancer tissue (Figure
6A-6B). The 131I-4H7 and 131I-mIgG treated groups were
characterized by a large field of ccRCC cell necrosis, with
dying tumor cells undergoing vacuolar degeneration of the
cytoplasm (Figure 6C-6D). There were more regions of
necrosis in the 131I-4H7 group than in the 131I-mIgG group
(Figure 6C-6D).

Discussion

the adult kidney and its incidence increases annually.

expressed in RCC vasculatures in some studies as high
as 98% [15], which indicates that B7-H3 could act as a
potent new cancer vessel-specific carrier to selectively
deliver antiangiogenic or vascular-disrupting agents to
diseased tissues, minimize any potential side effects, and
could help predict the clinical outcome of using different
targeted agents in the treatment of RCC.
In the present study, the level of B7-H3 expression
was higher in the tumor cells, tumor vasculatures, and
stroma of the ccRCC samples than in normal renal
specimens, which was consistent with previous studies,
providing a theoretical basis for 131I-labeled targeted
radiotherapy for RCC using B7-H3 monoclonal antibody
(4H7) as a carrier. The biodistribution studies indicated
that the radiochemical purities of both 131I-4H7 and
131
I-mIgG were >95%, and the stability of both traces
in PBS was >95% after incubating for 72 h. Moreover,
the tissue distribution experiments showed that 131I-4H7
was markedly absorbed by tumor tissue in tumor-bearing
nude mice, reaching a maximal uptake rate (3.32% ID/g)
at 24 h after intravenous injection. The retention of 131I4H7 was such that at 72 h, the uptake rate remained at
1.13% ID/g, indicating that 4H7 kept its activity after
being radioiodinated by 131I, which showed that it could be
absorbed by RCC tissues and suggested that it might make
a useful clinical candidate for a RCC-targeting treatment
option. All normal tissue concentrations decreased over
time but this did not occur to a great extent in the tumors.
It might be possible that the uptake rate of 131I-4H7 does
not distinctly reflect the accumulation of 4H7 in vivo
because of the many enzymes that can accelerate the
catabolism and deiodination of 131I-4H7 in normal tissue,
but in tumors, this does not appear to be the case, and
the accumulation of 131I-4H7 is gradually increased by the
action of B7-H3. This is advantageous to the treatment of
the tumors with radiotherapy.
Our therapeutic experiments showed that 131I-4H7
131
and I-mIgG treatment through intravenous injection
could inhibit tumor growth and alter the ultrastructure
and histopathology of RCC cells, resulting in irreversible
injury and wide necrosis, and that the therapeutic effect
was more pronounced in the 131I-4H7 group than in the
131
I-mIgG group. The results indicated that the targeted
effect of 131I-4H7 is better than that in 131I-mIgG.
Moderate energy β-particles from 131I-4H7 targeted to
tumor vasculatures in vivo were sufficiently damaging to
tumor vasculatures, which could lead to damaging tumor
angiogenesis, causing the hypoxic ischemia necrosis of
tumor cells. Several researches have indicated that cancer
cell-specific B7-H3 expression in ccRCC is ~20% [13,
15], although lower than that in tumor vasculatures, and
that the direct cytotoxic effect on ccRCC cells of 131I-4H7
cannot be completely ruled out.
In the therapeutic experiments, 131I-4H7 treatment
could inhibit tumor growth and cause irreversible injury
to RCC cells and tumor vasculatures, but we did not find
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumor regression in the 131I-4H7 group, which could be
related to the dose of 131I-4H7, which might not have been
sufficient (Supplementary Figure 1). Further studies are
needed to clarify the effect of different doses of 131I-4H7
on tumor growth. Meanwhile, there was no metastasis in
tumor-bearing nude mice treated with 131I-4H7 and the
other three agents, which indicated that the dose of 131I4H7 was correct and safe.
In conclusion, our results indicate that the
radiobiological effect of 131I-4H7 is stable and 131I-4H7
did suppress the development of human RCC xenografted
tumors in nude mice at day 28, which might provide a
new candidate for B7-H3 receptor-mediated targeted
radiotherapy in human ccRCC.

Materials and Methods
Clinical sample collection
Twenty-six patients with ccRCC who underwent
surgery for radical nephrectomy were included in the
study. Paired samples of ccRCCs and adjacent normal
tissues were immediately placed on ice, partitioned, and
fixed in 10% formalin. Patients were excluded from the
study if they had received chemotherapy or radiation
therapy before the surgical procedure or had undergone
previous renal surgery. ccRCC specimens were confirmed
by postoperative pathological diagnosis. Written informed
consent was obtained from each patient and this study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated
Hospital of Soochow University and Huai’an First
People’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, China.

Cell culture and animal model
The human ccRCC-derived cell line 786-0 was
purchased from the Institute of Cell Research, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco Invitrogen,
New York, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco Invitrogen, New York, USA) at 37˚C in
an atmosphere of 5.0% CO2. One hundred twenty male
BALB/c nude mice (5-6 weeks old and weighing 20-24 g)
were obtained from the West China Experimental Animal
Center of Sichuan University. These nude mice were bred
under aseptic-specified pathogen-free (SPF) conditions
and kept at a constant humidity and temperature (2528˚C). Animal experiments were performed according
to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee and were in compliance with the Guidelines
on Animal Welfare of the China National Committee for
Animal Experiments. Cells of 786-0 (2.0 x 107) in 0.2
mL normal sodium were injected subcutaneously into the
right axilla region of the mice. When the tumors reached

MBq), 0.2 mL 131I-4H7 (7.4 MBq), or 0.2 mL 131I-mIgG
(7.4 MBq) injected into the tail vein of each. There were
no fatalities among the treated mice during the study.
PET-CT imaging studies

B7-H3 monoclonal antibody 131I labeling

Following treatment with 131I-4H7, 131I-mIgG, 131I,
and saline in the four groups (four mice each), 16 tumorbearing nude mice were imaged in a supine position with
a one-head PET-CT equipped with a pinhole collimator
under intraperitoneal injection of 25.0 mg/kg sodium
pentobarbital. Static PET-CT images were acquired at days
0, 7.0, 14, and 21 among the four groups.

B7-H3 monoclonal antibody (4H7) was constructed
and prepared as previously described [23]. Na131I (37
TBq/L) was obtained from the Jiangsu Institute of Nuclear
Medicine (China). To prepare the mixture, 100 μL 4H7
were dissolved in 150 μL phosphate buffered saline (PBS,
pH 7.4) and mixed with 150 μL Na131I (approximately 185
MBq). The solution was mixed with 10 μL chloramine-T
and vortexed for 60 s, after which the reaction was
immediately halted using 100 μL partial glue solution.
The product was purified by column (Bio-Gel P-2 resin,
300 × 10 mm) with PBS. The peak 131I-4H7 solution was
collected and refiltered through a 0.22-μm membrane.
Using Xinhua I filter paper developed with 1:1 acetone
and saline, a chromatographic assay of radiochemical
purity was performed. Using the same procedure described
above, 10 μL murine IgG (mIgG, isotype-matched control;
Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA) were also
labeled with 131I as the negative control. The stability of
131
I-4H7 and 131I-mIgG in PBS was studied at different
time points and the percentage of parent tracer was
determined by radio-thin layer chromatography.

Tumor measurements
Following treatment with 131I-4H7, 131I-mIgG,
I, and saline of the four groups (eight mice each),
xenografted tumors were measured for long dimension
and short dimension once a day for 4.0 d and then every
3.0 d for 28 d. Tumor volume was calculated as follows:
Volume = 1/2 × long dimension (cm) × (short
dimension [cm])2
to draw the growth curve and observe tumor growth
[20]. All mice were sacrificed at day 28 and the tumors
were removed and weighed. We regarded saline group as
the control group, while groups of 131I-4H7, 131I-mIgG, and
131
I were all treated groups. The following formula was
used to calculate the rate of tumor suppression:
Rate of tumor inhibition (100%) = (1 - mean tumor
weight of treated group/mean tumor weight of control
group) × 100% [24].

Biodistribution studies

Hematoxylin-eosin
staining
immunohistochemical analysis

The tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly
divided into two groups of 36 mice each and 3.7 MBq
(0.1 mCi) 131I-4H7 and 131I-mIgG, respectively, were
injected into the tail vein of each. The mice were then
sacrificed at 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 24, 48, and 72 h after injection.
The heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, muscle, and tumor were
removed, weighed, and assayed for the 131I-4H7 and
131
I-mIgG uptake rate. The uptake rate was determined by
the percentage of radioactivity contained within each gram
of tissue compared to the total radioactivity injected into
the body. The tumor/nontumor tissue radioactive count (T/
NT) was then calculated.

Clinical specimens and tumor xenograft specimens
were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin.
We cut the paraffin-embedded specimens into sections of
5.0 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for
general morphological observation. Immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining was performed using a rabbit-specific
horseradish peroxidase/diaminobenzidine detection
IHC kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Tissue sections were stained with
anti-B7H3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:200 dilution) for
30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with
secondary rabbit-specific HRP-conjugated antibodies for
B7-H3 staining. Samples were visualized using a Nikon
Eclipse 80i upright microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Therapeutic studies
Groups and treatments
From 3.0 d before the experiment until its end,
48 nude mice with xenografted tumors (8-10 mm in
diameter) were orally administered 1.0% K131I to block
free 131I uptake by the thyroid. During this time, these
mice were fed under SPF conditions. According to body
weight and tumor size, the animals were divided into
four experimental groups of 12 mice each, which were
respectively treated with 0.2 mL saline, 0.2 mL 131I (7.4
