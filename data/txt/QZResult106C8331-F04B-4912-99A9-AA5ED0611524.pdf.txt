Abstract
Stage III/IV melanoma remains incurable in most cases due to chemotherapeutic resistance. Thus, predicting
and monitoring chemotherapeutic responses in this setting offer great interest. To overcome limitations of
existing assays in evaluating the chemosensitivity of dissociated tumor cells, we developed a label-free monitoring
system to directly analyze the chemosensitivity of undissociated tumor tissue. Using a preparation of tumor
micro-fragments (TMF) established from melanoma biopsies, we characterized the tissue organization and
biomarker expression by immunocytochemistry. Robust generation of TMF was established successfully
and demonstrated on a broad range of primary melanoma tumors and tumor metastases. Organization and
biomarker expression within the TMF were highly comparable with tumor tissue, in contrast to dissociated,
cultivated tumor cells. Using isolated TMF, sensitivity to six clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drugs
(dacarbazine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and treosulfan) was determined by impedance
spectroscopy in combination with a unique microcavity array technology we developed. In parallel, comparative
analyses were performed on monolayer tumor cell cultures. Lastly, we determined the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutic agents on TMF by impedance spectroscopy to obtain individual chemosensitivity patterns. Our results
demonstrated nonpredictable differences in the reaction of tumor cells to chemotherapy in TMF by comparison
with dissociated, cultivated tumor cells. Our direct impedimetric analysis of melanoma biopsies offers a direct
ex vivo system to more reliably predict patient-speciﬁc chemosensitivity patterns and to monitor antitumor
efﬁcacy. Cancer Res; 74(22); 6408–18. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The number of patients suffering from malignant melanoma continues to rise in most countries, which causes a
high mortality rate in a relatively young population under
the age of 50 years. Patients with melanoma (15%–25%)
develop metastases, either regional (stage III) or distant
(stage IV), and the majority of whom will die. Despite all
efforts, the mortality of melanoma has not changed over the
last 20 years, and current median survival of stage IV
patients is about 6 to 9 month and a 5-year survival state
of 0.5 % (1). Although novel therapeutic approaches either
targeting melanoma-speciﬁc mutations or stimulating anti1

melanoma immunity have recently been introduced into
clinical care and more are in development; chemotherapeutics like dacarbazine and cisplatin are widely in clinical use.
Nevertheless, there is the common consensus that there will
be no unique single therapy for melanoma, instead personalized therapies based on patient and tumor-speciﬁc characteristics will be the future direction.
In this context, in vitro chemosensitivity assays are promising tools to predict the individual outcome of chemotherapeutics and, moreover, could be used for an easy and fast
therapy control. Although previously developed chemosensitivity assays like the colony-forming unit assay, proliferation assay, and the MTT assay showed limited usefulness (2),
the ATP assay (ATP-TCA) revealed promising results at least
for the prediction of resistance for ovarian cancer (3) but
limited for the prediction of sensitivity (4, 5). For other
tumor entities like mamma carcinoma and melanoma, the
ATP-TCA assay also revealed limited prediction capabilities
(6, 7). Especially for melanoma studies, it was revealed to be
inapplicable for certain drugs like dacarbazine or temozolomide (8). The major drawback of all the established
chemosensitivity assays is the need of an extended amount
of tissue (> 1 cm3) for quantitative analysis of at least 4 to 6
compounds (9). Moreover, the tumor tissue has to be
completely dissociated, followed by further selection, ﬁltering, and recultivation steps, resulting in a complete loss of

Direct Bioelectronic Chemosensitivity Assay on Tumor Tissue

the original tissue organization, the extracellular matrix, and
probably of whole cell populations (6). Especially in the
context of tissue organization, recent studies demonstrated
that the chemotherapeutic response pattern can be substantially altered in two-dimensional (2D) cultures (10–13).
Therefore, there is a substantial demand for systems that
can perform quantitative chemotherapeutics efﬁcacy monitoring on three-dimensional (3D) cultures. Although molecular biologic end-point assays on 3D cultures are in general
more laborious and/or can be easily falsiﬁed when the readout (e.g., absorbance or ﬂuorescence) is performed directly
on the 3D culture, label-free bioelectronic methods have
recent advantages. Especially, impedance spectroscopy is a
suitable technique for characterization of single tumor cells
(14) as well as cellular degradation in 2D cultures (15, 16)
and, more strikingly, for quantitative monitoring of chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy in 3D cultures (17, 18). Using our unique
microcavity array (MCA) technology, we could detect the
sensitivity or even an aggressive response to certain chemotherapeutics within 3D in vitro tumor models (19). So the
important next step was to adapt the system for biologic
samples obtained from tumor biopsy material and demonstrate the applicability of the system for clinical use.

Materials and Methods
Tumor specimens and processing of melanoma tissue
Viable tumor tissue was obtained from tumor lesions after
surgical removal of cutaneous or subcutaneous melanoma
metastases and primary tumors. Therapeutically planned
excision of the metastases was indicated by the referring
clinicians independently of the possible additional use of left
over tumor specimens for our ex vivo and in vitro applications. Written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki with local ethics committee approval was
always obtained from each patient before surgery and before
subjecting parts of the melanoma tissue to ex vivo chemosensitivity testing. All tumor tissues used in our assays were
regarded as dispensable by the responsible clinicians and
pathologists. Sterile tumor specimens were placed into 10mL vials containing RPMI basal medium (Life Technologies)
and processed within 4 hours. Fat and surrounding connective tissue was extensively removed by scalpel and tumor
micro-fragments (TMF) prepared by manual cutting of
tumor tissue to the appropriate size. TMFs were cultivated
in 48-well plates (Greiner BioOne) with 300 mL complete
growth medium (RPMI, 10 % FCS, 1 % glutamax, 0.2 %
penicillin/streptomycin—all from Life Technologies) for 24
to 48 hours on a self-developed gyratory shaker (72 rpm). For
isolation of tumor cells, the tumor tissue was minced using
scalpels and seeded into T12.5 culture ﬂasks in 1-mL complete growth medium. After 2 to 3 days, medium was
exchanged, and adhered cells were expanded for experiments performed on monolayer cultures within ﬁve to ten
passages. For immunocytochemical staining, tumor tissue
pieces were ﬁxed in 4% formalin (Merck) for 60 minutes,
preserved in 25% sucrose solution (Carl Roth), and cryodissected to 20-mm slices by a CM 3050S cryostat (Leica).

Chemotherapeutic agents, vital staining, and
immunocytochemistry
Dacarbazine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cisplatin were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, gemcitabine from Enzo Lifescience, and treosulfan from the pharmacy at the University of
Leipzig Medical Center (Leipzig Germany). Microscopic
images were taken with an inverse Nikon TE2000 microscope.
For vital staining, cells were incubated with 2.5 mmol/L Calcein-AM (Life Technologies) and 1 mmol/L propidium iodide
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes and imaged with a Nikon
TE2000 microscope.
For immunocytochemical staining, ﬁxed and cryodissected
slides were permeabilized and blocked with 3 % BSA containing 0.1 % Triton-PBS for 45 minutes at room temperature (all
from Sigma-Aldrich). Afterwards, the sections were incubated
with anti-HMB45 (1:100; Dako), anti-S100 (1:200; Dako), antiMelanA (1:1,000; Abcam), E-cadherin (1:100; Cell Signaling
Technology), MelCAM (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
collagen I (1:200; Abcam) for two hours followed by incubation
with DyLight-488– or DyLight-549–conjugated anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 90 minutes (Dianova).
Finally, nuclei were stained by incubation with DAPI (1 mg/ml)
for one minute, followed by washing, drying, and covering with
Kaiser's glycerol gelatin (Merck). Images were taken using a
Nikon C1 plus confocal microscope (TE2000).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Impedimetric measurements on 2D cultures were performed as previously described (20). Brieﬂy, 5  104 melanoma cells were seeded in 200-mL complete growth medium
per well on self-developed interdigital electrode (IDE) arrays
coated with collagen I (Life Technologies) and cultivated for 3
to 4 days until cell layer conﬂuence. Impedance spectra (500
Hz to 5 MHz, 51 points, 10 mV amplitude) were automatically
recorded every 30 minutes for 96 hours with our impedance
measurement platform based on an Agilent 4294A highprecision impedance analyzer (Agilent Technologies) and our
self-developed controlling software IMAT v2.2.1. After 1 hour
premonitoring, the experiment was started by the application
of chemotherapeutics at the described concentrations. For
control groups, the appropriate solvent was used. For measurements on TMFs, we used our self-developed MCA (21)
with pyramidal cavities (edge length 400 mm) in combination
with the same impedance measurement platform as used for
the IDE arrays. Impedance spectra (5 kHz to 5 MHz, 51 points,
100 mV amplitude) were recorded. After the initial measurement (0 hour), the TMFs were individually transferred to 48well plates containing the concentration of the tested chemotherapeutics and incubated on the gyratory shaker for 72
hours. For discrete time points, TMFs were transferred
manually to the MCA (18), impedance spectra were recorded
instantly (approximately 5 seconds per TMF), and TMFs were
transferred back to the gyratory shaker. For data analysis, our
self-developed software IDAT v3.6 was used to automatically extract the cellular contribution to the impedance
magnitude by calculating the relative impedance according
to the equation ( j Z j with cells – j Z j without cells)/
Z j without cells  100% and, afterward, tracing the

maximum cell signal (peak) over time. For each independent
experiment on IDE arrays, four replicates (wells) were used
per treatment. For each independent experiment on TMF, six
TMFs were randomly selected and analyzed individually per
treatment. For statistical analysis, the relative impedance
maxima were normalized to experimental start (0 hour) and
to control values.
XTT assay
Metabolic activity and thereby cell viability were quantiﬁed
using an In Vitro Toxicology Assay Kit, based on the tetrazolium salt XTT (Sigma-Aldrich). Therefore, melanoma cells (4 
104 cells/well) were seeded onto adherent 96-well plates. After
incubation with compounds for 72 hours, the XTT solution was
added for 3 hours, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm
with a Sunrise plate reader (Tecan). In addition, the absorbance at 690 nm was measured as a background and subtracted from the 450 nm value as well as the blank (in
accordance to the manual). All values of an independent
experiment were normalized to the control values.
ATP assay
Cell viability was quantiﬁed using the ATPlite assay (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Therefore, melanoma cells (4  104 cells/well) were seeded onto
adherent 96-well ViewPlates (PerkinElmer) in a volume of 100
mL. After incubation with compounds for 72 hours, 50 mL of cell
lysis solution was added and incubated on an orbital shaker
(700 rpm) for ﬁve minutes. Addition of 50 mL substrate solution
(Luciferase/Luciferin) and shaking for ﬁve minutes initiated
the reaction for quantifying ATP concentration. After covering
the bottom with an adhesive seal and 10-minute dark adaption,
luminescence was measured using an Inﬁnite 200 luminescence plate reader (Tecan). The blank (without cells) was
substracted, and the ATP concentration was calculated
according to a standard curve.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad
Prism 5.02. All presented graphs are based on independent
experiments (number described by "n ¼ " in each graph).
Presented values are given as mean () SEM until otherwise
described. IC50 values were determined by nonlinear sigmoidal
curve ﬁtting with the normalized response and constant slope
setting. TMF-derived IC50 values are presented with 95 %
conﬁdence intervals (CI) and IC50 values from independent
experiments as mean () SEM. Multiple group comparisons
were done by the two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test.
Differences between two means with  , P < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant;  , P < 0.01 very signiﬁcant; and  , P < 0.001
extremely signiﬁcant.

monitoring on 3D cultures available, we developed the MCA
technology as previously described (19). For application of this
system to tumor biopsy material, the ﬁrst challenge was the
reliable generation of 3D tissue pieces with a certain size and
sufﬁcient number. The main prerequisite was to use a minimum of tumor biopsy material and the conservation of
the tumor cell composition and organization. Therefore, enzymatic digestion and reaggregation steps were excluded. Finally,
our approach was the manual sectioning of the tumor tissue
using scalpel, stereomicroscope, and clean bench for obtaining
TMFs (Fig. 1A) for the impedimetric monitoring using our
unique MCAs (Fig. 1B). We were able to easily generate TMF of
distinct sizes ranging from 200 to 1,000 mm in diameter.
After initial trials for evaluating optimum TMF size and yield,
we identiﬁed TMF with an average diameter of 500 mm as
optimum allowing us to isolate at least 300 TMFs from only
0.15 cm3 of solid tumor tissue. In a next step, we tried to
optimize the irregular shape of the TMF. Moreover, although
commonly the TMF core showed vitality directly after preparation, the outer shell consisted of damaged cells caused by
the cutting (Fig. 1C). Both problems could be minimized
by initial culturing on a gyratory shaker (Fig. 1B) for at least
24 to 48 hours (Fig. 1C). It has to be mentioned that optical
methods like the ﬂuorescence-based live/dead staining could
not be performed on all tumor biopsies. Especially, tumor
material with high melanin concentrations (black) showed
quenching and absorbance effects mainly in the green and
red spectral range (Supplementary Fig. S1). Finally, we were
able to generate rounded and overall vital TMF from a broad
range of melanoma primary tumors as well as metastases
(Fig. 1C, right), including solid but also metastases with necrotic and ambiguous cores. Generated TMF revealed an average
diameter of 400 mm. Therefore, we used MCA with a cavity
size of 400 mm (Fig. 1B). Taken together, we established a
robust protocol for generation of TMF that could be used for
the MCA-based bioelectronic analysis within 2 days after
preparation (Fig. 1A).
TMF reﬂects organization and tumor marker expression
of native tumor tissue
After successful preparation and generation of TMF from
tumor biopsies, we questioned how the structural organization, composition, and tumor marker expression of the TMF
compare with native tumor tissue and with cells derived from
dissociated tumor tissue. Therefore, we obtained from one
solid melanoma metastasis samples for ﬁxation and direct
immunocytochemical staining of native tissue, TMF, and
monolayer cultures (Fig. 2). First, we investigated the three
commonly used melanoma markers HMB45, S100, and MelanA
(MLANA). Although direct comparison of the staining intensity
has to be done carefully because of the different material
processing (ﬁxation, cryodissection for the tissue, TMF, etc.),
the native tumor tissue and TMF show high similarity, whereas
there are clear differences in the distribution of the tumor
markers in monolayer cultures. Especially, HMB45 showed
more homogeneous and higher expression in monolayer cultures. The same could be observed for S100 and MelanA that
were more widely expressed in native tumor tissue and TMF.

Direct Bioelectronic Chemosensitivity Assay on Tumor Tissue

Figure 1. Preparation of tumor fragments from human biopsy material for direct chemosensitivity testing. A, scheme of tumor biopsy processing. The received
viable tumor tissue is dissected into fragments of 500 mm size and cultivated on a gyratory shaker for 48 hours. For the impedimetric measurement of
chemosensitivity, the fragments are randomly grouped as six replicates for the treatments. B, preparation of tumor tissue is performed under sterile
conditions without enzymatic digestion using two scalpels. The gyratory shaker (second from left) is located in a cell culture incubator to maintain standard
cultivation conditions. For the impedimetric measurement, our self-developed MCA was used (right). For the TMFs, 400 mm cavities were used. C, in
general, the freshly prepared TMFs have an irregular fragment shape and an outer shell of damaged cells (red) while the fragment core is viable (green). After
48-hour cultivation on the gyratory shaker, the tumor fragment shape gets rounded off, and the damaged cells are diminished. Processing of a broad
range of primary tumors (PM) and tumor metastases (TM; three examples are shown) of different size and consistency as well as fragment generation
thereof was possible (bar, 5 mm for the photographs, 400 mm for the microscopic images).

Taken together, the tumor tissue and TMF showed a more
heterogeneous distribution of the tumor markers. Moreover,
staining of the extracellular matrix component collagen I
(COL1A) clearly showed comparable amount and distribution
in the tumor tissue and TMF in contrast to the monolayer
cultures where only residual collagen I could be observed.
Furthermore, native tumor tissue and TMF showed high level
of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression in nearly all cells and only
residual MelCAM (MCAM) expression, whereas monolayer
cultures showed high and widely MelCAM expression but only
low E-cadherin expression.
Taken together, the immunocytochemical analysis revealed
a high comparability in tissue architecture, tumor marker, and
extracellular matrix components expression in native tumor
tissue and TMF but not in monolayer cultures.
Impedimetric characterization and chemosensitivity
monitoring of TMFs
In a next step, we wanted to characterize the TMF by
impedance spectroscopy. Therefore, we characterized a
range of primary melanomas and melanoma metastases for
cell density and distribution. Exemplarily, we show the
detailed analysis of a primary tumor that showed low cell

www.aacrjournals.org

density but homogenous cell distribution, a tumor metastasis
with high cell density, and a tumor metastasis with overall
moderate cell density but heterogeneous distributed high cell
density clusters (Fig. 3A). Because tumor tissue biopsies were
obtained from different patients, the extracted cellular contribution to the impedance magnitude spectra (relative
impedance) revealed substantial differences (Fig. 3B).
Although at lower frequency (5 kHz) no differences were
observed, the relative impedance maximum of the primary
tumor was signiﬁcantly lower when compared with the
metastases (4.5 % vs. 7.3 % and 7.1 %). Furthermore, the
frequency of the maximum impedance was signiﬁcantly
different in all cases. More interestingly, metastasis 1 (TM1)
showed a signiﬁcant higher relative impedance at 5 MHz. For
a better understanding of how the observed spectra differences correlate with cellular characteristics, we established
an equivalent circuit model for the TMF-MCA system that is
dominated by the cellular capacitance (cell membrane capacitance), the cellular resistance (cell membrane resistance),
and the intercellular resistance (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
The mathematically simpliﬁed equivalent circuit model (Supplementary Fig. S2B) allows the easy visualization of the
inﬂuence of each parameter (Supplementary Fig. S2C).

Figure 2. Structural comparison of biopsy, biopsy-derived fragments, and
biopsy-derived cells. Parts of the obtained tumor tissue were ﬁxed and
cryodissected for immunocytochemical staining, as well as tumor
fragments obtained by mechanical processing. For comparison, a part of
the tumor tissue was mechanically minced. The isolated cells were
expanded and cultivated as monolayer cultures before ﬁxation. The
melanoma markers S100 and HMB45 were expressed in all three cases,
whereas distribution and expression level of HMB45 was different in
monolayer cultured cells. Also, the melanoma marker MelanA was
obviously lower expressed in the biopsy and biopsy-derived fragments.
Staining of the extracellular matrix component collagen I revealed distinct
higher expression and organized structures in the biopsy and biopsyderived fragments, whereas E-cadherin is lower expressed in monolayer
cell cultures. In contrast, MelCAM is highly expressed in monolayer cell
cultures but nearly completely absent in the biopsy and biopsy-derived
fragments (blue, cell nuclei). Bar, 50 mm.

Although an increased cell membrane capacitance leads to a
lowered impedance maximum shifted to lower frequencies,
the increase of the cell membrane resistance leads to an
increased impedance maximum also shifted to lower frequencies. More interestingly, the increase of the intercellular
resistance leads to a substantially increased impedance value
at 5 MHz. On the basis of the equivalent circuit model–
derived parameter simulation, we proposed a model for
correlation of the impedance spectra characteristics (maximum/value at 5 MHz) and the cellular characteristics of the
TMF (Fig. 3C). On the basis of the equivalent circuit model
simulations (Supplementary Fig. S2), lower values for the
relative impedance maximum can be assigned to a decreased
sum membrane resistance and increased sum membrane
capacitance (Supplementary Fig. S2B). This is the case if the
number of cells in a serial connection (Supplementary Fig.
S2A) is decreased and, therefore, the overall number of cells

6412

Cancer Res; 74(22) November 15, 2014

in the TMF is lowered. Furthermore, a low relative impedance value at 5 MHz can be assigned to a lowered extracellular resistance, which means there are less cell–cell contacts
or even bigger extracellular spaces between the cells. So the
combination of a low maximum and a low 5 MHz relative
impedance value can be correlated with a TMF that contains
low numbers of cells that show overall relative big extracellular spaces between the cells. If both relative impedance
values are shifted to higher values, this can be correlated with
a higher number of cells in a TMF and overall, small extracellular spaces and distinct cell–cell contacts. The third case
is represented by a high relative impedance maximum and a
low relative impedance value at 5 MHz that can be correlated
with a higher number of cells in the electrical ﬁeld but with
certain extracellular spaces between the cells or cell clusters.
The immunocytochemical stainings of the three investigated
tumors (Fig. 3A) correlate with our proposed model. Next, we
tested the effect of cisplatin on the isolated TMF. The
detailed impedance spectra analysis after 72 hours incubation with 100 mmol/L cisplatin revealed individual effects for
all three presented examples (Fig. 3D). Although for the
primary tumor and tumor metastasis 1–derived TMF there
was a signiﬁcant decrease of the relative impedance maximum, tumor metastasis 2 showed a signiﬁcant increase in
the relative impedance maximum and relative impedance at
5 MHz. On the basis of the proposed model, this means for
tumor metastasis 2 that treatment with cisplatin leads to an
increased cell density over the whole TMFs. For more details,
we analyzed the relative impedance maximum at concentrations of 3, 10, and 100 mmol/L cisplatin in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 3E). While for the primary tumor 10 mmol/L
cisplatin already induced a signiﬁcant decrease to 63% after
48 hours that was further decreased to 56% after 72 hours,
tumor metastasis 1 showed an initial signiﬁcant increase
within the ﬁrst 8 hours to 139% for 3 mmol/L and 126% for
100 mmol/L followed by a signiﬁcant decrease to 55% only for
100 mmol/L after 72 hours. In previous studies on dissociated
tumor cells using the ATP-TCA assay, sensitivity to cisplatin
was assigned to a concentration level below 1 to 10 mmol/L
within 24 hours (8, 22). In accordance to this deﬁnition and
our observations on TMF measurements, we assigned a
tumor as sensitive when a signiﬁcant impedance decrease
was observed at 10 mmol/L or lower concentrations within 48
hours and as insensitive when a signiﬁcant impedance
decrease was observed at higher concentrations and extended time ranges. Following this deﬁnition, the analyzed primary tumor can be considered as sensitive and the tumor
metastasis 1 as insensitive. In contrast, tumor metastasis 2
showed a concentration- and time-dependent impedance
increase with a maximum of 211% for 100 mmol/L cisplatin
after 72 hours. Taking our cellular distribution model (Fig.
3C) into account as well as a prior impedimetric study on 3D
cultures (18), the impedance increase can be correlated with
a higher cell density over the whole TMF. That means the
analyzed tumor metastasis 2 can be considered as aggressive
to cisplatin because the increased cell density can be only
caused by an increasing amount of tumor cells within the
TMF.

Direct Bioelectronic Chemosensitivity Assay on Tumor Tissue

Figure 3. Impedimetric characterization of tumor fragments and determination of tumor-speciﬁc response to chemotherapeutics. A, exemplarily, a
primary tumor and two tumor metastases were chosen that comprised a different expression of the tumor marker HMB45 (red) and cell density/
distribution within the tumor tissue, visualized by the nuclei staining (blue). B, these individual tumor characteristics can be quantitatively analyzed by
label-free impedance spectroscopy. The relative impedance spectra revealed tumor-dependent maximum at distinct frequencies as well as a
tumor structure–dependent relative impedance value at 5 MHz (n  130 fragments, mean  SD). C, on the basis of the equivalent circuit model
described in Supplementary Data, a scheme for explanation of cell density/distribution within tumor fragments and correlation to the analyzed
impedance parameter (relative impedance maximum and at 5 MHz) were proposed, where a low relative impedance MAX and 5MHz correlated with a
low number of cells and big extracellular spaces in a TMF, high relative impedance MAX and 5MHz correlated with a high cell number and cell contacts
in a TMF, and high relative impedance MAX in combination with a low 5MHz value correlated with an higher cell number in the electrical ﬁeld but with
certain extracellular spaces between cells and cell clusters. D, the tumor-speciﬁc response to 100 mmol/L cisplatin was analyzed by impedance
spectroscopy. The derived values for the 72-hour treatment were normalized to the appropriate controls (100%, dashed line) and revealed the
tumor-speciﬁc effect of the applied cisplatin (n  4). E, because impedance spectroscopy is a noninvasive and label-free method, the effect of
the applied chemotherapeutic (exemplarily shown for cisplatin) can be monitored over time to retrieve a time- and concentration-dependent response
pattern (n  4).

TMF-based determination of chemosensitivity pattern
After demonstrating that it is possible to quantitatively
measure the effect of a certain chemotherapeutic on individual
TMF, we wanted to use our impedimetric monitoring system to
determine chemotherapeutic- and tumor-speciﬁc response
patterns. Therefore, we tested six commonly used chemotherapeutics (dacarbazine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine,
cisplatin, and treosulfan) for melanoma. In general, we applied
at least six concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1,000 mmol/L.
The concentration range was adapted for each chemotherapeutic based on prior evaluations for in vitro chemosensitivity

assays (22–24) as well as our own preliminary investigations
on tumor cell line–derived spheroid cultures (19). For each
tumor biopsy, we performed immunocytochemical characterization (Fig. 4A) to assure that the material analyzed was of
melanoma origin and to get an overview of tissue organization,
including extracellular matrix (collagen I), ﬁbroblasts, and
vessels visualized by CD90 (THY1). Because the impedimetric monitoring is a nondestructive method, we used
the TMF after 72 hours (end of experiment) for live/dead
staining (Fig. 4B and C). Based on the detailed quantitative
results from the impedimetric measurement, a detailed

DAPI (blue). B, within the
chemosensitivity treatment
experiment, untreated tumor
fragments were stained as a
negative control for viable and
damaged cells after 72 hours.
Exemplarily, for one tumor
fragment, the transmitted light

and damaged cells (red) are shown.
C, time- and concentrationdependent chemotherapeutic
response pattern. The effect of
used chemotherapeutics was
analyzed by impedance
spectroscopy, represented as
concentration–response curves for
the cases where a response was
observable (4  n  6). C
represents the control values (not
included in the ﬁtting). For
veriﬁcation of the impedimetric
results, viable and damaged cells
were stained at the end of the
experiment (72 hours/highest
tested concentration). Exemplarily,
one of the measured tumor
fragment is shown as transmitted
light image (gray), viable cells
(green), and damaged cells (red).

concentration-dependent response pattern could be obtained
for each tumor biopsy (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4).
Live/dead staining could be performed with limitation to
melanin amount and distribution and correlated with the
impedance spectroscopy–derived results. When impedance
showed an early and substantial decrease like for doxorubicin,
this correlates with low level of living cells and an extremely
high amount of dead or damaged cells. In contrast, for paclitaxel, where no response to the chemotherapeutic could be
observed by impedance spectroscopy, the live/dead staining
revealed a high amount of living cells and nearly no damaged
or dead cells. In general, it has to be mentioned that the
ﬂuorescence-based live/dead staining reﬂects more the outer
shell of the TMF that is related to the amount and distribution
of melanin that can quench the ﬂuorescence signal. Only the
impedimetric results reﬂect the status of the whole TMFs
including the TMF core.
Because we were able to get more than 300 fragments from
each clinical tumor specimen with at least 0.15 cm3, each
treatment (at least 4 to 6 concentrations and controls) could be
performed with six replicates. The replicates were randomly
chosen from all fragments to take tumor heterogeneity into
account. This allowed us to calculate concentration response
curves and determine IC50 values for responding TMF. The

6414

comparison of tumor metastases from three different patients
revealed the unique time-dependent response pattern for each
patient (Table 1). On the basis of the IC50 values obtained over
time on the same TMF, for each chemotherapeutic, a classiﬁcation as sensitive, insensitive, and nonresponding could be
proposed according to the deﬁnition described in the previous
paragraph.
Correlation of TMF- and monolayer cultures–derived
chemosensitivity patterns
Next, we wanted to compare the impedance spectroscopy
response patterns from TMF with that obtained from dissociated and recultivated monolayer cultures. Moreover, we
wanted to compare the results of our impedimetric analysis
with established cytotoxicity (XTT assay) and chemosensitivity assays (ATP assay). Because both, the XTT- and ATP
assay, can only be performed on monolayer cultures, the
comparison of all three methods could only be done for these
2D cultures. For this experiment, we took a tumor metastasis,
isolated the TMF, and dissociated the residual material
(more than the half tumor biopsy). The dissociated cells
were expanded so that for each assay on monolayer cultures
three independent experiments could be performed. All
comparisons were done based on the determined IC50 values

that were obtained for each individual experiment on monolayer cultures and averaged (Table 2). The signiﬁcance
analysis revealed little differences between the three methods, which were only temporal effects for doxorubicin (24
hours, impedance vs. XTT and ATP) and treosulfan (24 hours,
each method against each other). For paclitaxel, this was
more prominent (48 and 72 hours, impedance vs. XTT and
ATP). It has to be mentioned that in contrast to the monolayer measurements that were repeated for each isolated
cells and assay in three independent experiments, the measurement on TMF could only be performed one time because
the TMFs of an indiviudal tumor biopsy are only available
once and could not be (sub)divided or further expanded. So
the statistical reliablity of the determined IC50 values for the
TMF measurements is given by the CI, in contrast to the
mean  SEM IC50 values determined from three independent
experiments on expanded monolayer cultures. Taking this
into account, nevertheless, there were substantial differences
between the IC50 values on TMF and monolayer cultures by
impedance spectrosopy. Despite gemcitabine, where no
response could be detected overall, all other chemotherapeutics showed differences in the range of one decade and
more. More strikingly, these differences did not tend to a
single direction like for cisplatin, where the TMF showed no
response or higher IC50 values in comparison with the
monolayer cultures. In contrast, doxorubicin and dacarbazine showed higher sensitivity in TMF than in monolayer
cultures. Taken together, this demonstrates that a theoretical
upscaling of results obtained from 2D cultures into a situ-

Discussion
The aim of the presented work was to develop a method for
feasible testing and monitoring of tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutics from native tumor material. Although established molecular biologic assays based on dissociated and
recultivated tumor cells showed predictive beneﬁts for single
tumor entities (4, 5), recent studies also demonstrated clear
limitations of the predictive power for different tumor entities
like the malignant melanoma (6). Moreover, actual studies
revealed that 2D cultures show substantial alterations with
regard to chemotherapeutic sensitivity when compared with
3D cultures (10–13) and that the tumor cell microenvironment
like extracellular matrix components and individual cell–cell
contacts are important for tumor biology as well as responsiveness to chemotherapeutics (25, 26). For this reason, we
established a preparation method that does not destroy the
original tumor organization and extracellular matrix. Specifically, we prepared TMFs from a range of primary tumors and
tumor metastases of malignant melanoma. We could demonstrate that TMF highly represents the tumor in vivo situation as
shown by immunocytochemical staining and, therefore, show
substantial advantages over dissociated and recultivated
tumor cells. In contrast, the monolayer cultures showed substantial alterations in melanoma marker expression and especially in the expression of adhesion molecules like E-cadherin

NOTE: Impedimetric measurements on TMF (4  n  6; 95 % CI) were compared with expanded tumor cells in 2D cultures that were
analyzed by impedimetric measurement, XTT assay, and ATP assay (n ¼ 3,  SEM). For all assays, the response is expressed as IC50
value in mmol/L. Differences between 2D and 3D as well as the used methods are marked by X.

and MelCAM. Our results are in line with previous comparative
studies of in vivo situations as well as in vitro 2D cultures (27)
and emphasize the importance of the tumor microenvironment. The efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutics and novel therapeutic
approaches considerably depends on the extracellular matrix
components, their organization, adhesion molecules as well as
cell–cell contacts (28, 29).
Therefore, we focused on the evaluation of optimized size
for TMF. The generation of TMF was possible with only smaller
amounts of tumor material (< 0.15 cm3) in comparison with
the amount that is needed for the ATP assay (>1 cm3; ref. 8).
This is an important advantage because the tumor tissue
amount needed for the ATP assay limits the clinical use for
certain tumor entities with a low tumor volume like primary
melanoma tumors (24). In addition, the dissociation and
isolation of cells from tumor tissue can lead up to 75 % of
damaged cells (8) and, therefore, introducing the risk of
selection of certain tumor or nontumor cells while eliminating
others. Therefore, TMF-based chemosensitivity monitoring
offers substantial advantages over monolayer culture–based
methods. The main limiting step for TMF chemosensitivity
monitoring is the manual preparation of the TMF from the
tumor biopsy material. To overcome this limitation, we are
working on automated dissection protocols so that this technique could be more easily expanded for, e.g., extended clinical
studies.

The second aim of this work was to establish a method for
the feasible monitoring of the TMF. Using our unique MCA
technology, we applied impedance spectroscopy for the labelfree and noninvasive characterization of the TMF composition. On the basis of the correlative immunocytochemical
analysis, we established an equivalent circuit model allowing
to retrieve more cell and tissue-speciﬁc information out of
the complex impedance spectra (30, 31). So additional impedance spectra–derived parameters could be used for analyzing
the heterogeneity of the isolated tumor tissue and included in
the standard chemotherapeutic sensitivity analysis in the
manner of an impedimetric multiparameter-derived principal
component analysis. Therefore, we could demonstrate that
impedance spectroscopy can be used for the reliable chemosensitivity measurement on native melanoma specimen similar to that obtained by XTT and ATP assays. Especially, the
comparison to the widely used ATP assay (2) revealed only rare
signiﬁcant differences for the determined IC50 values. In contrast, the comparison between TMF and monolayer culture–
derived IC50 values that were obtained by impedance spectroscopy showed substantial differences. More strikingly, these
differences in our currently used direct ex vivo 3D system were
not predictable in a direction like initial in vitro studies on cell
line–based comparisons between 2D and 3D systems demonstrated previously (32). Although the demonstrated dataset
only represents a single case, the detailed IC50 value–based

Direct Bioelectronic Chemosensitivity Assay on Tumor Tissue

statistical analysis demonstrates the applicability of impedance spectroscopy for the chemosensitivity monitoring of 2D
and 3D cultures and, moreover, that results obtained from
monolayer cultures cannot be used for extrapolation to 3D
in vivo–like cultures. Of course the measurement of TMFs from
an individual tumor biopsy can only be performed once,
comparable with a histologic analysis of the tumor tissue itself.
But the demonstrated time- and concentration-dependent
analysis based on the amount of TMFs that can be obtained
even from small biopsy samples allows for the calculation of
time-dependent IC50 values with CIs that reveal a statistically
more comprehensive sensitivity pattern than, e.g., for ATPTCA–based end-point assays on monolayer cultures without
any statistical reliability information (8, 22) or sum values with
high variances (24). For the impedimetric quantiﬁcation of
TMF response to chemotherapeutics at least for sensitive
tumors, the determined CIs are in the range of the CIs for
IC50 values of single monolayer measurements. Interestingly,
the CIs for insensitive TMFs are much bigger (see Table 1,
tumor metastasis 3) that could be explained by the heterogeneity of the TMFs. Although some TMFs isolated from a tumor
biopsy could show a certain sensitivity, TMFs from another
part of the tumor show insensitive or even no response. So the
micro heterogeneity of a single tumor is reﬂected in the
heterogeneous response of the individual TMFs from the same
tumor. This leads to higher variances of the determined
impedance values and, ﬁnally, bigger CIs that correlate with
a classiﬁcation of an insensitive tumor.
Taken together, we established a novel system for the
reliable and direct ex vivo chemotherapeutic sensitivity
monitoring of tumor entities like melanoma. This system
could be helpful, especially for tumor entities with poor
clinical outcome where patient-speciﬁc chemotherapeutic
treatment is required. We could demonstrate that chemosensitivity testing on TMF reveals unpredictable different
results in comparison with dissociated and in vitro–recultivated tumor cells.

In conclusion, we have examined for the ﬁrst time a new
method for the quick and direct ex vivo chemosensitivity
monitoring of native tissue from patients with melanoma. In
a next step, our system should be validated in future studies
where the predictive power will be correlated with the
outcome of the chemotherapy for an appropriate number
of patients. Given the high number of solid neoplasm from
different organs, we want to point out that our system is not
restricted to the malignant melanoma. Therefore, it should
be tested on further tumor entities, especially where chemosensitivity assays on dissociated tumor cells show low
predictive power.
