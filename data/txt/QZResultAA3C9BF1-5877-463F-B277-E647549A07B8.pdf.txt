Abstract
Neuroblastoma is an often fatal pediatric cancer arising from precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous
system. 13-Cis retinoic acid is included in the treatment regimen for patients with high-risk disease, and a
similar derivative, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), causes neuroblastoma cell lines to undergo differentiation.
The molecular signaling pathways involved with ATRA-induced differentiation are complex, and the role that
DNA methylation changes might play are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genome-wide
effects of ATRA on DNA methylation using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation applied to microarrays representing all known promoter and CpG islands. Four hundred and two gene promoters became demethylated,
whereas 88 were hypermethylated post-ATRA. mRNA expression microarrays revealed that 82 of the demethylated genes were overexpressed by >2-fold, whereas 13 of the hypermethylated genes were underexpressed.
Gene ontology analysis indicated that demethylated and re-expressed genes were enriched for signal transduction pathways, including NOS1, which is required for neural cell differentiation. As a potential mechanism
for the DNA methylation changes, we show the downregulation of methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3B,
along with the upregulation of endogenous microRNAs targeting them. Ectopic overexpression of miR-152,
targeting DNMT1, also negatively affected cell invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth, contributing
in part to the differentiated phenotype. We conclude that functionally important, miRNA-mediated DNA
demethylation changes contribute to the process of ATRA-induced differentiation resulting in the activation
of NOS1, a critical determinant of neural cell differentiation. Our findings illustrate the plasticity and dynamic
nature of the epigenome during cancer cell differentiation. Cancer Res; 70(20); 7874–81. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is an often fatal cancer of childhood arising from precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system
(1). These tumors have notable heterogeneity in clinical
behavior, ranging from spontaneous regression or differentiation into a benign ganglioneuroma to rapid progression and
death due to disease. A number of somatically acquired
genetic abnormalities significantly influence the clinical outcome of these tumors. One of the most important genetic
markers of unfavorable prognosis in these tumors is amplification of the MYCN transcription factor (2, 3), which affects
the expression levels of a large number of genes (4) and
miRNAs (5–7). Genome-wide analyses of MYCN binding sites
indicate that MYCN binds to a few thousand sites throughAuthors' Affiliations: 1Departments of Cancer Genetics, Royal College of

out the genome, playing a role as both a transcription factor
and a mediator of global chromatin structure (8–10).
Children with high-risk neuroblastoma are generally
treated with intensive multi-modal chemotherapy, with
13-cis-retinoic acid included in the final part of the treatment
regimen in an effort to eliminate minimal residual disease
(11, 12). A related compound, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)
induces a number of neuroblastoma cell lines to undergo
differentiation, with a significant increase in neurite length
and a marked decrease in the rate of cell proliferation.
SK-N-BE is a MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line known
to be responsive to ATRA (13). Transcriptional downregulation of MYCN precedes morphologic differentiation of neuroblastoma cells induced by ATRA, an event that is critical for
both morphologic differentiation and for decreased cell proliferation (14, 15). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) is a signaling
molecule that is upregulated following ATRA-induced differentiation of SK-N-BE cells which greatly accelerates the
differentiation process when ectopically overexpressed (16).
The mechanism leading to transcriptional upregulation of
NOS1 following ATRA-induced differentiation, however, is
unknown. In a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation
patterns of SK-N-BE cells before and after ATRA-induced differentiation, we now show that DNA methylation alterations
(predominantly demethylation events) affect many gene promoter regions following differentiation, including the NOS1

gene. We also propose a novel model accounting for the
widespread DNA methylation changes incurred during the
differentiation of neuroblastoma cells involving the targeting
of DNA methyltransferases by MYCN repressed miRNAs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
SK-N-BE, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS, and Kelly were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection whereas LAN-5 was
obtained from the Children's Oncology Group Repository.
Both repositories confirm cell line identities by genotyping
and none of the lines were passaged in our laboratory for
more than 6 months prior to use. Each line was also further
validated by aCGH for previously published genomic imbalances. ATRA (5 pmol; Sigma) was continuously administered
by replacing the medium every 24 hours for 7 days. Following
fixation with paraformaldehyde, cell morphology was monitored using the neuronal specific antibody βIII tubulin
(Abcam) followed by staining with an anti-rabbit Alexa 488–
conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) as recommended by the
suppliers. The MYCN repressible SHEP-TET21N cell line
was obtained from Dr. Louis Chesler with the permission of
Prof. Manfred Schwab and validated by aCGH. Cells were treated with 100 ng/mL of doxycycline to repress MYCN transcription. RNA was isolated after 48 hours. Kelly neuroblastoma
cells were cultured in 10 mL of RPMI 1640 containing 5-aza2′-deoxycytidine (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of
2 μg/mL for 72 hours.
Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation
The protocol used for methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) to microarrays analysis was as previously
described by Murphy and colleagues (9). Four micrograms of
sonicated DNA was incubated overnight with 10 μg of anti-5′
methyl-cytidine antibody (Eurogentec). MeDIP and input DNA
were differentially labeled and hybridized to a CpG island
promoter plus array from Roche NimbleGen as recommended
by the manufacturer. Analysis was performed using the methylation application in NimbleScan version 2.4. Only peaks
detected in duplicate experiments were used for further analysis. Methylation peaks mapping −2,000/+500 bp around the
transcriptional start sites were used for further analysis. Raw
log 2 ratio data for array experiments is available at http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress (Accession E-TABM-964).
Microarray gene expression profiling
Total RNA was extracted from SK-N-BE cells using the
Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit and the SuperScript Double-Stranded
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) was used to generate cDNA
according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Cy3 labeling
of ds-cDNA was performed overnight using the NimbleGen
One-Color DNA Labeling Kit.
Four micrograms of Cy3-labeled ds-cDNA was hybridized
to the Homo sapiens 4 × 72K gene expression array (Roche
NimbleGen) representing 24,000 protein-coding genes,
according to the protocols of the manufacturer. The mRNA
expression data was analyzed using NimbleScan software

version 2.4, which applied quantile normalization (17), and
expression values were obtained using the Robust Multi-Chip
Average algorithm as described by Irizarry and colleagues
(18). Expressional alterations of 2-fold across both biological
repeats were considered significant. Microarray expression
data is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress (ArrayExpress Accession: E-MEXP-2557).
Bisulfite sequencing
A total of 500 ng of DNA from biological replicates for
ATRA-treated and untreated cells was bisulfite-converted
using the EZ DNA-methylation Gold Kit (Zymo). PCR primers
were designed using methyl primer express (http://www.
appliedbiosystems.com/methylprimerexpress). PCR products
were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen)
and sequenced at MWG Biotech. Methylated HeLa genomic
DNA (New England Biolabs) was used as a positive control.
Resulting electropherograms were analyzed using the BIQ
analyzer (19).
Computational analysis
Compilation, smoothing, and preprocessing of data was
carried out using in-house developed Java (v1.6) software.
Prior to genomic correlation analysis of methylation profiles,
mean smoothing was carried out over a 10-probe window
and over gaps less than 100 bp. Analysis and visualization
of genomic methylation was carried out using R statistical
programming language (v2.10).
MicroRNA transfections
The Pre-miR to miR-152, and Pre-miR negative control 1
(Applied Biosystems) were introduced into the cells by reverse transfection using the transfection agent siPORT
NeoFX (Ambion). Pre-mIR (30 nmol/L) was used in each
transfection. Total RNA/miRNA was extracted 24, 48, and
72 hours after transfection using mirNeasy kit (Qiagen).
Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
Reverse transcription was carried out using 50 ng of total
RNA and the High-Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems). The following TaqMan assays were obtained from
Applied Biosystems: DNMT1, Hs00945899_m1; DNMT3A,
Hs00173377_m1; DNMT3B, Hs001171875_m1; miR-152,
HS000475; and NOS1, Hs00167223_m1). qPCR analysis was
performed in triplicate on the 7900 HT Fast Real-time System
and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used
for normalization in gene expression studies and RNU66 in
microRNA assays. miRNA TaqMan Low Density Arrays
(368TaqMan PCR assays; Applied Biosystems) were used for
miRNA profiling, as described (5). A relative fold change in
expression of the target gene transcript was determined using
the comparative cycle threshold method (2−ΔΔCT).
Luciferase reporter
A 321-nt-long region (Fig. S1A) of the 3′ untranslated region
(3′-UTR) of DNMT1 containing the predicted miR-152 binding
site was ligated into the psiCHECK-2 luciferase vector (Promega) 3′ of the luciferase gene. As a negative control, three

mutations were introduced into the seed region of the miR152 binding site of this sequence (Fig. S1B). After 24 hours,
the cells were cotransfected with either the pre–miR-152
mimic and luciferase construct or a scrambled negative control sequence and luciferase construct using LipofectAMINE
2000. Seventy-two hours after cotransfection, cells were lysed
and luciferase activity was measured by Dual-Glo Luciferase
Assay (Promega). All experiments were normalized to an
internal firefly luciferase.
Western blot
Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay from Pierce. Proteins were fractionized on 6%
polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with the 1:1,000 antiDNMT1 Antibody (Sigma), 1:500 anti-MYCN (NCM-II-100,
Abcam), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam). Signal was detected using Immobilon Western
(Millipore).
Cell invasion assays
Invasion Assays were carried out using BD Biocoat Growth
Factor–Reduced MATRIGEL Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences) as recommended by the supplier.
Growth curve
Cells were set up in six-well plates at equal densities for
transfections with miR-152 mimics, scrambled oligonucleotide negative control, and nontransfected cells. Cells were
harvested from six-well plates at 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-hour
time points and hemocytometer counts were averaged from
triplicate wells.
Acid phosphatase assay for cell proliferation
Cells were transfected in 96-well plates (103 cells per well).
At 96 hours, wells were washed twice with PBS and 10 mmol/L
of p-nitrophenol phosphate in 0.1 mol/L of sodium acetate
with 0.1% triton X-100 was added. Plates were incubated at
37°C for 2 hours when the reaction was stopped with 50 μL
of 1 mol/L sodium hydroxide per well. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Values were normalized to the scrambled
oligonucleotide negative control.
Colony-forming efficiency
A 1% agarose solution was plated on 10 cm2 Petri dishes
and cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 in 10 mL of culture medium.
Colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, photographed,
and counted in replicate studies.

Results
Identification of recurrent DNA methylation changes at
CpG islands and promoter regions following
ATRA treatment
ATRA treatment induced SK-N-BE cells to undergo differentiation, as evidenced by the outgrowth of neurites (Fig. 1A),
a decrease in cell growth (Fig. S2A), and a substantial
decrease in MYCN mRNA and protein (Fig. S2B and C). To

assess a potential role for DNA methylation alterations in
the process of ATRA-induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation, anti–methyl-cytidine immunoprecipitated DNA and
non-immunoprecipitated input DNAs from untreated and
ATRA-treated SK-N-BE were hybridized to microarrays
containing 33,485 tiled regions representing all known
promoter and CpG island regions. In total, 2,499 and
1,721 promoter and nonpromoter CpG island sites were
hypermethylated in untreated and treated SK-N-BE cells, respectively. A pairwise comparison of log 2 ratio values from
MeDIP biological replicates resulted in a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 for the ATRA-treated SK-N-BE cells
and 0.93 for untreated cells, indicating highly significant
reproducibility of experimental results (Fig. S3A and B). In
contrast, comparison of ATRA-treated versus untreated
cells yielded a lower correlation coefficient of 0.80, indicating that epigenetic changes have occurred in ATRA-treated
cells (Fig. S3C).
In total, 402 gene promoters (excluding nonpromoter CpG
island sites) were demethylated following ATRA treatment
(across two biological replicates), with 82 of these genes
being overexpressed greater than 2-fold in the ATRA-treated
cells (7 d post-ATRA) relative to untreated, as ascertained by
mRNA expression microarrays (Fig. 1B; Table S1). In contrast, only 88 genes became hypermethylated following ATRA
treatment, 13 of which were underexpressed in ATRA-treated
cells by >2-fold (Fig. 1B; Table S1). The demethylation of
promoter regions in ATRA-treated and untreated cells was
confirmed following sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA
from representative genomic regions (Table S2).
Gene ontology analysis of the genes that were demethylated and re-expressed after ATRA treatment indicated that
signal transduction was the only significantly enriched
category (P = 0.0069; Table S1). One of these demethylated
signal transduction genes, NOS1 (Fig. 1C; Table S2), was reexpressed 10.6-fold (P = 0.0009) at 48 hours post-ATRA and
persisted at >20-fold between 6 and 9 days post-ATRA (validated by qPCR; Fig. 1D). This gene was of particular interest
because it has been shown to promote neuroblastoma cell
differentiation (16), indicating that some of the demethylated
and re-expressed genes are functionally relevant for the
process of differentiation.
To determine if the demethylation and re-expression of
NOS1 is a general phenomenon occurring during ATRAinduced neuroblastoma cell differentiation, we treated two
additional sensitive cell lines (SH-SY5Y and LAN-5) with
ATRA, along with an insensitive cell line, SK-N-AS, as a negative control. ATRA caused a pronounced outgrowth of neurites in SH-SY5Y and LAN-5, but not in SK-N-AS (Fig. S4A-F),
and MYCN transcript levels were significantly reduced in SHSY5Y and LAN-5 (Fig. S2D). Sequencing of bisulfite-converted
DNA indicated substantial demethylation of the NOS1
promoter region (Fig. S5A), which resulted in significant
NOS1 re-expression (Fig. S5B) following ATRA treatment of
SH-SY5Y and LAN-5. SK-N-AS, on the other hand, showed a
slight increase in methylation and no re-expression was detectable. To further confirm that demethylation was responsible for NOS1 overexpression, we treated an independent

5-aza-deoxycytidine, which resulted in a 10-fold increase in
NOS1 expression following 3 days of 5-aza-deoxycytidine
exposure (Fig. S6). We conclude that functionally significant
demethylation of the NOS1 promoter sequence is a general
occurrence during ATRA-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells.
Molecular mechanisms leading to genome-wide
demethylation events in ATRA-treated cells
Diminished expression of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 is
known to cause genome-wide demethylation events (20), and
our mRNA expression microarray analyses indicated that
DNMT1, as well as DNMT3B, were significantly downregulated

www.aacrjournals.org

following ATRA treatment of SK-N-BE cells. qPCR analysis confirmed a statistically significant decrease in gene expression for
DNMT1 and DNMT3B in SK-N-BE, as well as in SH-SY5Y and
LAN-5 following ATRA treatment (Fig. 2A). Conversely,
ATRA-insensitive SK-N-AS cells displayed a modest, but statistically significant, increase in DNMT1 and DNMT3B transcripts
(Fig. 2A), which might explain the overall increase in methylation detected at the NOS1 promoter following ATRA treatment
(Fig. S5A). We conclude that DNMT downregulation is a
general feature of ATRA-sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines,
but not for lines that are insensitive to ATRA treatment.
None of the DNMT genes displayed promoter region methylation before or after ATRA treatment (MeDIP analysis),
indicating that methylation was not responsible for their

downregulation following ATRA exposure. To determine if
upregulated miRNAs might be causally related to DNMT
downregulation following ATRA treatment of SK-N-BE,
we carried out expression analysis for 368 miRNAs using
low-density TaqMan arrays. Seventeen miRNAs were overexpressed by at least 2-fold in two biological replicates of
ATRA-treated SK-N-BE cells, and 17 miRNAs had a 2-fold
or greater decrease in expression (Fig. S7). MiR-152, which
has an 8-mer conserved seed match with DNMT1, increased
2.5-fold following ATRA treatment, which was validated using an individual qPCR assay following ATRA treatment of
SK-N-BE, SH-SY5Y, and LAN-5 (Fig. 2B). Thus, overexpression
of miR-152 in response to ATRA might account for the reduction of DNMT1. This was validated by transfection of mature
miR-152 mimics into SK-N-BE cells (Fig. S8), which resulted
in the downregulation of DNMT1 on mRNA expression
microarrays. This was validated by qPCR and at the protein
level by Western blot (Fig. 2C), indicating that endogenous
upregulation of miR-152 in ATRA-treated cells is the likely
cause for DNMT1 reduction. In addition, cotransfection of
a luciferase reporter construct containing a segment of the
DNMT1 3′-UTR inclusive of the miR-152 target site with
mature miR-152 mimics into SK-N-BE led to a significant reduction in luciferase activity relative to cotransfection with a
scrambled negative control (Fig. 2D). Mutation of the miR-152

target site abrogated the reduction in luciferase activity,
leading us to conclude that miR-152 directly targets DNMT1,
consistent with a report by Branconi and colleagues demonstrating miR-152 targeting of DNMT1 in a gallbladder cancer
cell line (21).
Expression microarray analysis also indicated that ectopic
upregulation of miR-152 had a global effect on the transcriptome of SK-N-BE cells, leading to the downregulation of 3,483
genes and the upregulation of 2,765 genes. For genes downregulated by >3.0-fold, there was a statistically significant (P =
0.01) enrichment of conserved miR-152 target sites in their
3′-UTR region, whereas upregulated genes (>1.5-fold) had a
statistically significant (P = 0.01) decrease in miR-152 target
sites (Fig. 3). These results indicate that miR-152 overexpression has both direct and indirect effects on the transcript
levels of large numbers of genes.
The mechanism leading to increased miR-152 levels
following ATRA treatment could be related to diminished
MYCN expression, which occurs within 6 hours after ATRA
exposure (ref. 15; also Fig. S2B). We have previously shown
that miR-152 is expressed at significantly lower levels in
MYCN-amplified primary tumors relative to those lacking it
(5), indicating that MYCN either directly or indirectly
represses this miRNA. To further validate the repression of
miR-152 by MYCN in an experimental system, we evaluated

Discussion

regions of mRNAs that are underexpressed (left) or overexpressed
(right) following miR-152 ectopic upregulation. Black columns are the
observed number of genes with predicted target sites whereas the white
columns represent the number of expected target sites based on the
analysis of 106 randomly generated miRNA–mRNA interactions. Genes
that are underexpressed 3-fold to 6-fold show a statistically significant
enrichment of miR-152 target sites, whereas there is a statistically
significant inverse correlation between miR-152 predicted 3′-UTR target
sites and genes that are overexpressed.

the effects of changing MYCN levels in the SHEP-TET21N
cell line (22), which contains a doxycycline repressible
MYCN construct, on miR-152 levels. MiR-152 expression
increased ∼3-fold within 48 hours after MYCN depletion
(Fig. 4), whereas DNMT1 mRNA levels decreased by ∼5-fold,
experimentally confirming an inverse relationship between
MYCN and miR-152 expression. The mechanism leading to
decreased DNMT3B mRNA levels following ATRA is uncertain, although this too could be miRNA-driven. MiR-125a/b
and miR-26a/b, predicted to target DNMT3B, are upregulated in ATRA-treated cells (ref. 23; ∼1.5-fold upregulation
in our experiments). Our model for the molecular events
leading to ATRA-induced differentiation is illustrated
in Fig. 5.
Biological effects of miR-152 ectopic overexpression in
SK-N-BE cells
A number of studies have shown that ectopic overexpression of some miRNAs, the endogenous levels of which are increased in response to ATRA, have phenotypic effects that
correspond to an ATRA-induced phenotype (23–25). Ectopic
upregulation of miR-152 in SK-N-BE cells resulted in a significant decline in cell invasiveness and anchorage-independent
cell growth, but had no effect on the rate of accumulation of
cell numbers (Fig. S9 A–D). It also did not cause the outgrowth of lengthy neurites similar to those observed following ATRA treatment. Although upregulation of miR-152 by
itself cannot fully account for ATRA-induced differentiation,
it does have significant biological effects that contribute
towards this phenotype.

This study represents the first genome-wide analysis of
DNA methylation changes in neuroblastoma cells induced
to undergo differentiation by ATRA, revealing the extensive
nature of epigenomic changes. On a gene-specific basis,
others have also reported DNA methylation changes in other
cell types treated with ATRA. For example, Love and colleagues (26) showed that ATRA treatment of HL60 leukemia
cells leads to hypermethylation of the TERT promoter, possibly caused by aberrant expression of DNA methyltransferases. Rowling and colleagues (27), on the other hand,
reported that rats treated with ATRA exhibited an overall decrease in endogenous levels of DNA methylation, consistent
with our in vitro study indicating an overall reduction of
methylation at gene promoters (27). Although DNMT levels
were not assessed in the report by Rowling and colleagues
(27), the authors propose an alternative mechanism in which
levels of glycine N-methyltransferase are increased in
response to ATRA treatment, leading to a reduction in levels
of S-adenosyl-methionine, which acts as a substrate in
numerous transmethylation reactions and its limited availability might be responsible for the observed reduction in
methylation levels. In contrast, Nouzova and colleagues
(28), using different assessment methods and a significantly
lower resolution microarray platform than what was applied
in our study, did not observe changes in DNA methylation,
but did report increases of histone acetylation at 282 CpG
islands and decreases at 34 loci. Their observation of overall
increased histone acetylation following ATRA, however, is
consistent with our observation of overall decreased DNA

in turn, leads to the demethylation and upregulation of numerous genes such as NOS1, which promote neural cell differentiation.

methylation in that both are associated with a transcriptionally active chromatin state.
The downregulation of DNMTs after ATRA is a potential
explanation for the observed overall decrease in DNA methylation in the differentiated cells. In addition, the upregulation of miRNAs that target these DNMTs is the most
plausible explanation for their reduction following ATRA
treatment. Moreover, miRNAs targeting DNMTs, such as
miR-152 and miR-26a/b, seem to be either directly or indirectly repressed by MYCN, given that they are underexpressed in MYCN-amplified primary tumors (5, 7). Thus,
the downregulation of MYCN in ATRA-treated SK-N-BE
cells accounts for the upregulation of these DNMT targeting
miRNAs.
Ciani and colleagues (16) suggested that NOS1 upregulation in response to ATRA is responsible for the downregulation of MYCN transcription. They proposed that NOS1 causes
dephosphorylation of RB, which then leads to the sequestration of E2F transcription factors, which positively regulate
MYCN, in an RB-E2F protein complex. In this model, the depletion of E2Fs results in the transcriptional downregulation
of MYCN. The timing of events following ATRA treatment,
however, is inconsistent with this model. As shown by Thiele
and colleagues (15), MYCN transcriptional downregulation is
detectable within 6 hours after ATRA exposure whereas Ciani
and colleagues (16) showed that endogenous NOS1 protein is
only detectable between days 5 and 7 after ATRA. Here, we
further show that NOS1 mRNA increase is not detectable
until 48 hours post-ATRA. The timing of these events is more
consistent with our model (Fig. 5), whereby early MYCN
downregulation leads to the upregulation of miRNAs that
target DNMTs. The late appearance of NOS1 expression is
then the consequence of demethylation of the NOS1 gene
promoter sequence followed by transcriptional activation.
The molecular mechanism leading to MYCN downregulation
remains unknown, although a number of miRNAs predicted
to target MYCN are upregulated following ATRA treatment
(e.g., miR-24, miR-214, and let-7e).
MiR-128, also upregulated in response to ATRA, inhibits
neuroblastoma cell motility and invasiveness through direct
targeting of the Reelin and DCX genes (24). Here, we show

that ectopic upregulation of miR-152, which also becomes
endogenously overexpressed following ATRA exposure, negatively regulates cell invasiveness and anchorage-independent
cell growth, but does not induce differentiation or inhibit cell
growth. The genes being targeted by miR-152 that negatively
affect cell invasiveness and anchorage-independent cell
growth remain to be elucidated. The signaling pathways
activated following the exposure of neuroblastoma cells to
ATRA are complex and include the activation of additional
miRNAs that affect cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth.
The neuronal-specific miRNAs-9, 125a, and 125b are upregulated in response to ATRA and target neurotrophin receptor
tropomyosin-related kinase C, a protein that is critical for
regulating neuroblastoma cell growth (23). Moreover, ectopic
upregulation of miR-125b was also determined to promote
neuronal differentiation of the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell
line through antagonizing a number of neuronal genes (25).
In conclusion, the DNA methylation changes observed on
ATRA treatment further illustrate the dynamic nature of the
epigenome. At least one of the genes that becomes demethylated and expressed in response to ATRA, NOS1, is clearly
implicated in neuroblastoma cell differentiation (16), indicating that epigenetic changes play important functional roles
in this process. Whether DNA methylation changes affecting
the expression of other gene sequences or miRNAs have
functional relevance for differentiation is an interesting question warranting further study.
