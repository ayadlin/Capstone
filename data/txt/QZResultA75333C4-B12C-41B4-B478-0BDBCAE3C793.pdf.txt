Abstract
The importance of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
in melanoma is underscored by the prevalence of activating
mutations in N-Ras and B-Raf, yet clinical development of
inhibitors of this pathway has been largely ineffective,
suggesting that alternative oncogenes may also promote
melanoma. Notch is an interesting candidate that has only
been correlated with melanoma development and progression; a thorough assessment of tumor-initiating effects of
activated Notch on human melanocytes would clarify the
mounting correlative evidence and perhaps identify a novel
target for an otherwise untreatable disease. Analysis of a
substantial panel of cell lines and patient lesions showed that
Notch activity is significantly higher in melanomas than their
nontransformed counterparts. The use of a constitutively
active, truncated Notch transgene construct (NIC) was
exploited to determine if Notch activation is a ‘‘driving’’ event
in melanocytic transformation or instead a ‘‘passenger’’ event
associated with melanoma progression. NIC-infected melanocytes displayed increased proliferative capacity and biological
features more reminiscent of melanoma, such as dysregulated
cell adhesion and migration. Gene expression analyses
supported these observations and aided in the identification
of MCAM, an adhesion molecule associated with acquisition of
the malignant phenotype, as a direct target of Notch transactivation. NIC-positive melanocytes grew at clonal density,
proliferated in limiting media conditions, and also exhibited
anchorage-independent growth, suggesting that Notch alone is
a transforming oncogene in human melanocytes, a phenomenon not previously described for any melanoma oncogene.
This new information yields valuable insight into the basic
epidemiology of melanoma and launches a realm of possibilities for drug intervention in this deadly disease. [Cancer Res

differentiation processes during both embryonic and postnatal
development (1). Notch signaling has also been implicated in
neoplastic malignancies; a potential role for aberrant Notch
signaling was first observed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL), wherein a chromosomal translocation resulted in the
liberation of a truncated and constitutively activated form of the
Notch1 receptor (NIC; ref. 2). Since this original report, the link of
the Notch signaling pathway to tumorigenesis has been well
established. Aberrant Notch signaling has been linked to prostate
carcinoma (3), mouse mammary epithelial cell tumors (4), small
cell lung cancer (5), neuroblastoma (6), cervical carcinoma (7), and
most recently Kaposi’s sarcoma (8). Activated Notch can transform
primary Schwann cells (9) and, in collaboration with the
adenovirus E1a protein, cultured rat embryonic epithelial cells (10).
Metastatic melanoma is a highly invasive tumor derived from
epidermal melanocytes that is refractory to most therapies.
Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells that reside along the
basement membrane in the basal layer of the epidermis
interspersed among surrounding keratinocytes. Keratinocytes, in
turn, play a major role in regulating the growth and differentiation
of melanocytes. Under normal conditions, E-cadherin is expressed
on the surface of both melanocytes and keratinocytes and is the
critical cell adhesion protein between these two cell types in the
human epidermis (11, 12). Loss of E-cadherin expression is a
well-documented step in melanoma development and progression
(13–15). Conversely, up-regulation of other cell adhesion molecules,
such as MCAM (MelCAM, MUC18, CD146), N-cadherin, and avh3
integrins, have been strongly correlated with melanoma progression and metastasis (16–19). Expression of MCAM, a highly
glycosylated membrane protein, confers metastatic potential in
experimental murine models to MCAM-negative melanoma cells
(18, 20).
Recent data suggest that Notch activation may play a role in
melanoma progression. We have previously shown that activation
of Notch signaling promotes the progression of early-stage
melanoma cell lines in a h-catenin–dependent manner both
in vitro and in vivo (21). Furthermore, microarray profiling
comparing the gene expression of normal human melanocytes to
human melanomas revealed up-regulation of Notch target genes in
melanoma cells, suggesting activation of the Notch signaling
pathway in melanoma (22). Based on these observations, we sought
to determine the effects of Notch activation on primary human
melanocytes. The data described herein define an oncogenic role
for Notch signaling in melanocytes and highlight the potential for
Notch inhibition to be used as a therapeutic approach for the
treatment of melanoma.

Statistical analyses. Data ( from triplicate experiments) are presented as
mean F SD and were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t test. A P value of
<0.05 was considered significant.

Results
The Notch signaling pathway is activated in human
melanoma compared with primary human melanocytes. To
assess the potential role of Notch signaling in human melanocytic
transformation, the activation status of the Notch pathway was
assayed through several approaches. Using an antibody against
activated Notch1, immunohistochemical staining was performed
on the samples of melanoma patients (Fig. 1A). Active Notch1
staining colocalized with that of HMB45, a marker for cells of
melanocytic origin. Normal tissues immediately adjacent to the
lesion did not stain positively for active Notch1 (Fig. 1A, far right).
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on RNA from fresh melanoma
lesions and established cell lines to determine levels of Notch1

expression (Fig. 1B); from 9 lesions and 14 cell lines, every sample
tested expressed at least 5-fold more Notch1 than the representative primary human melanocytic control. The expression of
Notch target genes in laser-microdissected melanoma lesions,
melanoma cell lines, and melanocyte cell lines showed that Hes1
and Hey1, but not Hey2, were dramatically up-regulated in both
melanoma tissue and cell lines when compared with primary
melanocytes (Fig. 1C, top). Microarray analyses on a panel of
melanoma cell lines displayed similar patterns of gene expression
(Fig. 1C, bottom). RT-PCR analysis confirmed these data, as Notchtarget transcripts were elevated in melanoma lines when compared
with melanocytes (data not shown). Immunoblots depicted absent
or low levels of the activated Notch1 protein in melanocytes but
higher levels in melanoma lines, suggesting that the Notch
signaling pathway is only active in malignant cells (Fig. 1D).
Mechanism of Notch activation in melanoma. Based on the
endogenous overexpression of active Notch1 protein in melanoma
tissue and cell lines, melanoma cell lines were screened in search of

activating mutations within the Notch1 locus similar to those
reported in at least 50% of T-ALLs (23). Seventeen human
melanoma and three T-ALL cell lines were sequenced within exon
26 (heterodimerizations; HD-N1, HD-N2, and HD-C) and exon 34
(transcriptional activation domain and PEST domain) of Notch1.
Although no activating Notch1 genetic alterations were identified
in the melanomas, insertional and missense mutations were
confirmed in the three T-ALL cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Approximately, 70% of the melanoma cell lines displayed the T
allele of the C/T SNP previously reported at nucleotide 5097 (23).
Despite the absence of Notch1 activating mutations in the
melanoma cell lines tested, dramatic up-regulation of the Notch1
transcript was detected by real-time RT-PCR in 14 melanoma cell
lines and 9 fresh tumor specimens, but not normal melanocytes
(Fig. 1B), suggesting that the mechanism for enhanced Notch
activation in melanoma may be due to Notch overexpression.
Melanoma tumor specimens and cell lines showed significantly
higher levels of Notch1 expression, with an average of 7.9-fold and
37.8-fold increase over a representative melanocyte cell line HEMN,
respectively. The levels of Notch2/4 transcripts were also robustly
up-regulated in melanoma lesions and cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
Inhibition of Notch1 activity elicits antimelanoma activities.
The data, thus far, suggested strong Notch activation in melanoma;

melanoma growth were tested in vitro. To suppress the Notch
signaling cascade, a dominant-negative mutant of the Mastermindlike (MAML) protein was used. This construct acts as a pan-Notch
inhibitor and prevents transcription of downstream target genes by
binding to NIC and preventing the recruitment of coactivator
proteins to the Notch enhanceosome. The myc-tagged DN-MAML
vector was lentivirally infected into two melanocyte cell lines and
two melanoma cell lines. After selection, these lines were analyzed
for DN-MAML expression by probing for the myc tag (Fig. 2A, top).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Hey1 and Hey2 revealed suppression of these Notch targets in DN-MAML–infected melanoma cell
lines. Hes1 levels were initially low and generally unaffected by DNMAML expression (Fig. 2A, bottom). As depicted in Fig. 2B, the
growth rate of DN-MAML–infected melanoma cell lines was
significantly reduced when compared with green fluorescent
protein (GFP)–expressing cells but was unaffected in two primary
melanocyte cell lines. Consistent with these data, suppression of
Notch signaling activation through pharmacologic inhibition
selectively decreased the growth of melanoma cell lines, but not
melanocytes, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). A g-secretase
inhibitor, GSI X, at the highest concentration of 5 Amol/L inhibited
melanoma growth by as much as 32%, as determined by MTT
analysis. These results are compatible with a previous work
indicating that g-secretase inhibitors preferentially decrease the
growth of human melanoma cells, but not melanocytes (26).

Expression of human activated Notch1 (NIC) in human
melanocytes. Based on the above data, the potential role of Notch
signaling in melanocyte transformation and melanoma development was investigated. To determine the effects of active Notch1
expression in primary human melanocytes, the NIC gene was
introduced into primary human melanocytes. First, lentiviral
vectors encoding either GFP or NIC-GFP were used for stable
intracellular expression of NIC. To verify expression of the lentiviralderived NIC, Notch1 mRNA and protein expression was assessed via
semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence of GFP and NIC-infected melanocytes was performed
with a Notch1 antibody to assess the localization of the lentiviralderived construct (Fig. 3B). NIC protein was appropriately detected
in the nucleus and was also capable of activating expression of
downstream Notch1 target genes, as evidenced by increased
expression of the Notch-regulated genes Hey1 and Hey2 (Fig. 3C).
Because the NIC oncoprotein has been shown previously to
promote cellular growth (27, 28), the effects of constitutive Notch1
activation on primary melanocyte growth were ascertained in vitro.
The growth rate of NIC-infected melanocytes was significantly

increased compared with that of corresponding GFP control cells
(Fig. 3D). Collectively, the data suggest that Notch is activated in
melanoma and that this is sufficient to increase melanocytic
growth in vitro.
Activated Notch1 promotes cytoskeletal changes, increased
adhesion, and migration in primary human melanocytes. In
addition to increased growth rates, at 72 to 96 hours postinfection,
NIC -expressing melanocytes exhibited marked morphologic
changes compared with GFP (Fig. 4A) or uninfected parental
controls (data not shown). The cells exhibited shorter dendrites,
grew in large clusters, and formed endothelial-like networks
reminiscent of vasculogenic mimicry (29). These changes were
consistent across all six melanocyte lines infected with the NIC
lentivirus. In addition to these morphologic changes, the NIC
transgene promoted increased adhesion in melanocytes (Fig. 4B).
Lastly, migration assays using Boyden chambers showed that
NIC-infected melanocytes possess increased invasive capacity
compared with GFP-infected controls (Fig. 4C and D). Each of
these biological properties supports a role for Notch activity in
acquisition of a malignant phenotype, although the downstream

morphologic changes induced by active Notch1 expression. FOM 123 and 124 NIC cells form networks of capillary-like structures when grown in monolayer compared

properties compared with GFP-infected controls within 2 h postplating. *, P < 0.005 (Student’s t test). C and D, NIC-infected and GFP-infected melanocytes were

enhanced ability of NIC-infected FOM cells to migrate; 1205Lu melanoma cells acted as a positive control.

effector molecules of Notch1, which may contribute to the
observed phenotypes, are uncertain.
Identification of MCAM as a target of Notch signaling in
melanocytes. Microarray analyses were performed to aid in the
identification of genes differentially expressed between Notchinfected and control melanocytes [microarray data is available at
GEO (GSE15040)]. Using GeneSpring software gene ontology
classification analysis, subgroups with specified biological functions were identified, including those within cell adhesion and
invasion families; a small fraction of those genes are depicted in
Supplementary Table S1. Notably, MCAM, an important mediator
of melanoma progression, was significantly up-regulated in NICinfected cells, as well as the N-cadherin (CDH2; ref. 24).
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a panel of genes selected
from the gene ontology groups to confirm the observed changes in
gene expression (data not shown). Of these, E-cadherin and MCAM
were differentially expressed and, therefore, chosen for further
analysis because loss of E-cadherin and up-regulation of MCAM
expression are well-characterized events in melanoma development and progression. Immunoblotting analyses showed that NIC
expression induced robust up-regulation of MCAM and downregulation of E-cadherin in the melanocyte cells (Fig. 5A). The gene
expression changes induced by NIC are consistent with a shift
toward a malignant phenotype. Expression levels of h3 integrin,
another adhesion protein implicated in melanoma development

www.aacrjournals.org

and progression, however was unaffected by NIC overexpression
(Fig. 5A).
MCAM is a direct Notch1 target. To begin to test the
hypothesis that MCAM is a direct Notch target, melanocytes were
plated on tissue culture dishes anchored with Jagged-1 to induce
ligand-mediated Notch activation. Cell extracts confirmed that
MCAM expression was induced in response to Notch activation,
indicating that MCAM up-regulation can occur through induction
of endogenous Notch1 receptor activity (Fig. 5B). Moreover, in an
MCAM-expressing melanoma cell line, WM 3248, inhibition of
Notch activation with a g-secretase inhibitor suppressed MCAM
expression; likewise, expression of NIC increased MCAM levels, as
predicted (Fig. 5C). Knockdown of MCAM in NIC-expressing
melanocytes had no bearing on their ability to grow in soft agar,
suggesting that up-regulation of MCAM in this system is a
contributory, rather than an initiating event in melanomagenesis
(data not shown).
Based on the robust up-regulation of MCAM in NIC-expressing
melanocytes, we sought to further define the mechanism of MCAM
induction. Multiple CSL/Notch-binding sequences were identified
within the MCAM promoter, including a nonconserved sequence at
477, as well as three conserved sites in the proximity of 3.5K
( 3487, 3510, and 3522; Fig. 5D, top). The consensus motif,
hexamer TGGGAA, has been shown to bind CSL (30) and is present
in the human p21 promoter (31), the murine Hes1 promoter (32),

and the human Skp2 promoter (33). ChIP assays showed that NIC
strongly enhanced CSL binding at the conserved 3500 sites on the
MCAM promoter. The nonconserved sequence at 477, however,
yielded less binding (Fig. 5D, bottom). The results from ChIP assays
were subsequently confirmed through electrophoretic mobility
shift assay analysis (data not shown). Together, these data
underscore a direct role for Notch in the up-regulation of MCAM
and, likely, disease progression.
NIC confers transforming properties to melanocytes in vitro.
Loss of contact inhibition is a common phenotype of transformed
cells. After selection, NIC-infected cells formed discrete foci,
whereas GFP control cells did not (Fig. 6A). These foci were
adherent and viable, as determined by trypan blue exclusion (data
not shown). The changes in cellular morphology and the loss of
contact inhibition in NIC-transduced melanocytes were reminiscent
of transformed cells. In addition, GFP-infected and NIC-infected
cells were plated, and their survival was assayed over the span of 72
hours in limiting media conditions (Fig. 6B). NIC-infected cells

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

display enhanced survival in media conditions that otherwise kill
normal human melanocytes.
Anchorage-independent growth is a hallmark of malignant cell
transformation that highly correlates with neoplasia; thus,
anchorage-independent colony-forming capacity of GFP and NICinfected melanocytes was analyzed. After plating GFP and NICinfected melanocytes in soft agar with normal melanocyte media,
GFP cells failed to establish viable colonies whereas NIC-infected
cells readily formed colonies (Fig. 6C). To assess neoplastic
transformation potential in vivo, 2  106 GFP or NIC-expressing
melanocytes were injected s.c. into NOD-SCID mice. Twelve weeks
postinjection, tumors were not detected (data not shown),
suggesting that additional genetic events may be required to
achieve growth in animal models.

Discussion
Here, we show that Notch1 signaling is activated in melanoma
cells, but not melanocytes, and that constitutive Notch1 activation

Notch1 Transforms Primary Melanocytes

confers transforming properties to primary melanocytes in vitro.
Notch receptors 1, 2, and 4 are overexpressed in melanoma cell lines
and lesions, particularly when compared against primary melanocytes or normal human skin. Notch and Notch target genes are
up-regulated in both melanoma lesions and melanoma cell
lines. Ectopic NIC expression induced gross morphologic changes,
increased growth, adhesion, migration, and survival, and resulted in
the loss of E-cadherin expression and up-regulation of MCAM, two
well-characterized events in melanoma development. We identify
MCAM as a direct Notch target due to the presence of two highaffinity CSL binding sites present in the MCAM promoter. The NIC
oncoprotein conferred anchorage-independent growth, increased
survival, and loss of contact inhibition; suppression of Notch
signaling decreased the growth of melanoma cell lines, whereas
primary melanocytes were unaffected. Taken together, these data
suggest that deregulation of Notch signaling plays a specific role in
promoting a transformed phenotype in human melanocytes and
define the importance of Notch signaling in human melanoma.
Our microarray data describing Notch pathway activity is
underscored by a recent report by Hoek and colleagues that
revealed up-regulation of Notch2 and Hey1 in a separate but
distinct panel of malignant melanoma cell lines, suggesting a role
for Notch activation in the transformation of melanocytes (22).
Previous immunohistochemical studies on early-phase melanoma
lesions have shown overexpression of full-length Notch1 protein in
melanoma tissue compared against benign human nevi (21) and
normal human skin (8). In our current study, we examined active
Notch1 levels and found overexpression of this protein by
immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded melanoma
lesions and Western blotting of melanoma cell lines. Furthermore,
suppression of Notch signaling via a dominant-negative MAML
construct or g-secretase inhibition did not affect melanocyte
growth but inhibited melanoma proliferation in vitro, as well as
melanoma tumorigenicity, in SCID mice (21). Our study focused on
Notch1 because of its overexpression in melanomas; however,
Notch2 and Notch4 transcripts were also increased in melanoma
tissues and cell lines. Therefore, it is likely that other Notch
receptors play a role in mediating the oncogenic effect of Notch1
signaling activation. Further studies will be useful in determining
the contribution of the individual Notch receptors to melanocyte
transformation and melanoma development.
In light of studies highlighting novel activating mutations in TALL (23), it might be expected that such mutations exist in
melanomas as well. However, sequencing of a panel of 17 melanoma
lines did not reveal any genetic alterations within the heterodimerization or PEST domains of Notch1 that have previously been
shown to harbor activating mutations in 50% of human T-ALLs. In
the absence of genetic mutations, another mechanism must exist to
account for enhanced Notch signaling in human melanoma. We
favor a scenario in which overexpression of Notch receptors in
melanoma cells results in robust Notch signaling activation in
human melanoma. Indeed, we observed significant up-regulation of
Notch receptors 1, 2, and 4 at the mRNA level by real-time RT-PCR
in melanoma cell lines and fresh melanoma specimens when
compared with normal melanocytes. There are likely upstream
factors that account for the increased transcriptional activity at the
Notch receptor loci. One possibility was Ras, as it has been
previously shown that oncogenic Ras activates Notch signaling and
the wild-type Notch1 receptor is required to maintain the neoplastic
phenotype of Ras-transformed cells (34). Studies performed in our
laboratory, however, do not implicate mitogen-activated protein

kinase signaling in transcriptional regulation of Notch1, as
inhibitors of both Raf and MEK were unable to abrogate expression
of Notch1 (data not shown). Certainly, unraveling the mechanistic
details responsible for Notch1 up-regulation in melanoma will be of
immense value in the near future.
E-cadherin is the key adhesion molecule expressed by keratinocytes and melanocytes that permits keratinocytes to communicate
with and exert regulatory control over melanocytic cellular processes
(12, 15, 35). Loss of E-cadherin expression allows epidermal
melanocytes to regulate their growth and adhesion independent of
keratinocytes and is a key event in melanoma development (12, 15).
Here, NIC down-regulated E-cadherin expression in melanocytes and
also promoted robust up-regulation of MCAM, a cell adhesion
molecule whose protein levels highly correlate with aggressive
invasive behavior of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo (17–19). Our
data suggest that MCAM is a direct Notch target based on the
identification of two high-affinity CSL binding sites within the MCAM
promoter. We propose that, in early melanoma tumorigenesis, Notch
activation results in MCAM expression and may ultimately
contribute to melanoma progression. The significance of these data
is underscored because loss of E-cadherin and up-regulation of
MCAM are consistent with changes in gene expression that occur
during the development of malignant melanoma.
There is only one report of active Notch1 protein acting alone to
fully transform primary cells (9). Forced NIC expression in primary
rat Schwann cells resulted in transformation and loss of Schwann
cell differentiation markers. Active Notch1-induced transformation
in rat kidney embryo cells; however, this was in cooperation with
adenoviral protein E1A. Synergy of activated Notch1 and papillomavirus oncogenes E6 and E7 has also been reported in the
transformation of immortalized epithelial cells (36). Whereas
transformation of immortalized melanocytes subsequent to overexpression of a single oncogene has been reported (37, 38), full
transformation of primary melanocytes, as defined by inducing
tumorigenicity in animal models, generally requires disruption of
several pathways, including Rb and p53 (39, 40). Oncogenic Ras is
capable of promoting growth in soft agar as well as tumor
formation in SCID mice in primary melanocytes but only in the
presence of the SV40 early region (SV40ER), which encodes the
viral large T and small T oncoproteins, and the catalytic subunit of
the telomerase holoenzyme (39). Thus, although in our primary
melanocyte cell lines NIC overexpression alone was capable of
inducing a transformed phenotype in vitro, it is not alarming that
NIC-infected cells failed to form tumors in NOD-SCID mice;
therefore, Notch1 overexpression alone is not sufficient for full
neoplastic transformation due to a lack of in vivo growth. However,
our findings are nonetheless of significant importance in the
consideration of signaling pathways that are deregulated and
cooperate in the process of melanocyte transformation and
melanoma development.
Our current studies strongly suggest that constitutive Notch
signaling is associated with melanocyte transformation and
melanoma tumorigenesis. Of particular significance is the ability
of a g-secretase inhibitor to selectively inhibit the growth of
melanoma cell lines. These findings are consistent with a recent
report identifying a g-secretase inhibitor that induced effective
apoptosis in human melanoma cells while sparing melanocytes (26).
Multiple g-secretase inhibitors have been developed and are
presently in trials for use in the treatment of Alzheimer’s patients
(41). Based on the recent identification of activating Notch
mutations in roughly 50% of human T-ALLs (23), therapies designed

to interfere with Notch activation, such as g-secretase inhibitors,
will undoubtedly be explored as a treatment option. Further
extending the potential of Notch inhibitors for the treatment of
human disease, these experiments suggest that targeting the Notch
signaling may be a viable strategy in the therapy of melanoma.
