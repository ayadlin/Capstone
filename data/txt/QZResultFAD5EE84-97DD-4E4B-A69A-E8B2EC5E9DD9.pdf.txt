which also exhibits anticancer activities through modulation of
multiple pathways, including activation of the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AhR; ref. 9) and inhibition of the androgen receptor
(AR; ref. 10). Other studies show that DIM inhibits growth and
induces apoptosis in many different cancer cell lines, and these
effects are associated with altered expression of cell cycle and
growth regulatory genes, induction of growth inhibitory factors
and apoptosis, modulation of kinase activities, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and induction of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress (11–19). The effectiveness of DIM as an
anticancer agent is due, in part, to activation of one or more of
these proapoptotic and/or growth inhibitory pathways.
Recent studies in this laboratory have used DIM as a synthetic
scaffold for the synthesis of a series of 1,1-bis(3¶-indolyl)-1(p-substituted phenyl)methanes or methylene-substituted DIMs
(C-DIM; ref. 20). The addition of the bulky substituted phenyl group
abrogated interactions with the AhR and AR; however, initial
results of receptor screening assays showed that compounds
containing trifluoromethyl (DIM-C-pPhCF3), t-butyl (DIM-CpPhtBu), and phenyl (DIM-C-pPhC6H5) substituents activated
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg; ref. 20).
These PPARg agonists inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in
breast, pancreatic, colon, bladder, leukemia, and other cancer cell
lines through both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent
pathways (20–26).
DIM-C-pPhCF3 is a PPARg agonist but also activates Nur77 (27),
a member of the nerve growth factor–induced B (NGFI-B)
subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors that contains three proteins
[i.e., NGFI-Ba (Nur77), NGFI-Bh (Nurr1), and NGFI-Bg (Nor1;
ref. 27)]. Subsequent screening of a series of C-DIM analogues also
identified the p-methoxy (DIM-C-pPhOCH3) and unsubstituted
(DIM-C-Ph) analogues as Nur77 agonists, which did not activate
PPARg. The Nur77-active C-DIMs inhibited growth and induced
apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, and this result correlated with
previous studies showing that overexpression of Nur77 (unliganded)–induced apoptosis in thymocytes (28). In this study, we
show that Nur77 is expressed in several colon cancer cell lines, and
that Nur77 is also overexpressed in human colorectal tumors
compared with non-tumor tissue. Nur77 agonists induce tumor
necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) protein
in RKO colon cancer cells, and we have used this cell line as a
model to investigate the effects of the Nur77 agonists DIM-CpPhOCH3 and DIM-C-Ph. The results indicate that Nur77 agonists
inhibit growth and induce apoptosis and TRAIL in RKO cells, and
these responses are inhibited by a small inhibitory RNA for Nur77
(iNur77). DIM-C-pPhOCH3 also inhibits tumor growth in athymic
nude mice bearing RKO cell xenografts. Microarray and cell culture

Abstract
Nerve growth factor–induced BA (NGFI-BA, Nur77) is an
orphan nuclear receptor with no known endogenous ligands;
however, recent studies on a series of methylene-substituted
diindolylmethanes (C-DIM) have identified 1,1-bis(3¶-indolyl)1-(phenyl)methane (DIM-C-Ph) and 1,1-bis(3¶-indolyl)-1(p-anisyl)methane (DIM-C-pPhOCH3) as Nur77 agonists.
Nur77 is expressed in several colon cancer cell lines (RKO,
SW480, HCT-116, HT-29, and HCT-15), and we also observed by
immunostaining that Nur77 was overexpressed in colon
tumors compared with normal colon tissue. DIM-C-Ph and
DIM-C-pPhOCH3 decreased survival and induced apoptosis in
RKO colon cancer cells, and this was accompanied by
induction of tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) protein. The induction of apoptosis and
TRAIL by DIM-C-pPhOCH3 was significantly inhibited by a
small inhibitory RNA for Nur77 (iNur77); however, it was
evident from RNA interference studies that DIM-C-pPhOCH3
also induced Nur77-independent apoptosis. Analysis of DIMC-pPhOCH3–induced gene expression using microarrays identified several proapoptotic genes, and analysis by reverse
transcription-PCR in the presence or absence of iNur77
showed that induction of programmed cell death gene 1 was
Nur77 dependent, whereas induction of cystathionase and
activating transcription factor 3 was Nur77 independent. DIMC-pPhOCH3 (25 mg/kg/d) also inhibited tumor growth in
athymic nude mice bearing RKO cell xenografts. These results
show that Nur77-active C-DIM compounds represent a new
class of anti–colon cancer drugs that act through receptordependent and receptor-independent pathways. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) conjugates are highly expressed in
cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and
cauliflower (1, 2), and this compound and its metabolites have been
linked to the cancer chemopreventive and chemoprotective effects
of vegetables (3–7). I3C is highly unstable in the acid environment
of the gut and undergoes heterodimerization and rearrangement to
give several products (8), including 3,3¶-diindolylmethane (DIM),

the samples against a background control as blank was measured at 490 nm
using a microtiter plate reader.
Western blot analysis. Cells were treated with the C-DIM compounds,
and caspase inhibitor and leptomycin B were added simultaneously. Cell
lysates were prepared using lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150
mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate; 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Amol/L
leupeptin, and 1 Ag/mL aprotinin were added fresh]. After centrifugation of
lysate at 15,000  g for 20 min, the supernatants were recovered, and
protein was quantified by the Bradford protein assay using reagent kit from
Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Protein samples (20–60 Ag) were size-separated by
electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Separated
proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blot was
blocked by incubating in blocking buffer [5% skim milk, 10 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20] for 1 h at room temperature
and was incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4jC. Incubation
with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit secondary
antibody was then carried out at 37jC for 1 h. Antibody-bound proteins
were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting
analysis system.
Immunostaining. Cells were fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde,
added with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis,
IN) for 10 min, and preincubated for 1 h with 10% normal goat serum
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were incubated with antiNur77 antibody (1:100) or anti-IgG (1:100) and incubated with FITCconjugated secondary antibody (1:500; Vector Laboratories). The four-well
chambers were mounted with mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) to
be viewed on a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Colon tumor specimens
were provided from a selection of tumor and non-tumor tissues obtained at
the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. After deparaffinization, tissue sections were subjected to antigen retrieval with 0.1% pepsin in
0.01 N HCl at room temperature for 10 min followed by treatment with 0.1%
H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were incubated with
the normal rabbit IgG or rabbit polyclonal anti-Nur77 antibody (1:100) at
4jC overnight after blocking with normal goat serum at room temperature
for 1 h. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated
goat anti-rabbit IgG at room temperature for 30 min. Detection was made
with Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (Biogenex Laboratories, San Ramon, CA) as the chromagen following
manufacturer’s protocol. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated, and coverslips were mounted.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA), and 1 Ag RNA was used to synthesize
cDNA using Reverse Transcription System (Promega). The PCR conditions
were as follows: initial denaturation at 94jC (2 min) followed by 35 cycles
(PDCD1), 28 cycles (CSE), 30 cycles (ATF3), or 26 cycles [glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)] of denaturation for 1 min at 94jC;
annealing for 1 min at 53jC (PDCD1) and 61jC (CSE, ATF3 and GAPDH);
extension at 72jC for 1 min; and a final extension step at 72jC for 5 min.
The mRNA levels were normalized using GAPDH as an internal
housekeeping gene. Primers obtained from IDT (Coralville, IA) and
used for amplification were PDCD1 (sense, 5¶-CTGGGCGGTGCTACAACTGGG-3¶; antisense, 5¶-ATGTGGAAGTCACGCCCGTTGG-3¶), 291 bp; CSE
(sense, 5¶-GGCGATCCATGTGGGCCAGGA-3¶; antisense, 5¶-ATGTCTCCATGCTTATGGACAAT-3¶), 483 bp; ATF3 (sense, 5¶-CTGTTGGATAAAGAGGTTTCTCT-3¶; antisense, 5¶-ATGTCCTCTGCGCTGGAATCAG-3¶), 348 bp; GAPDH
(sense, 5¶-ACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGGGCG-3¶; antisense, 5¶-CTCCTGGAAGATGGTGATGG-3¶), 212 bp. PCR products were electrophoresed on
3% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV
transillumination.
Microarray experiments. Microarray studies focused on early-induced
genes, and RKO cells were treated with DMSO or 12.5 Amol/L DIM-CpPhOCH3 for 2 and 6 h. RNA was isolated as described for the reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiment and analyzed for gene expression
using the Codelink Whole Genome Bioarrays (300026), and three replicates
were determined for each time point and the DMSO control. The
microarray data were analyzed using GeneSpring software version 7.2

studies also show that DIM-C-pPhOCH3 induces receptor-dependent
and receptor-independent proapoptotic responses and genes, including programmed cell death gene 1 (PDCD1; Nur77 dependent)
and cystathionase c-lyase (CSE) and activating transcription factor 3
(ATF3; Nur77 independent). This is the first study to show that
Nur77 is overexpressed in human tumors, and that Nur77-active
C-DIMs induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells through nuclear
receptor-dependent and receptor-independent pathways.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human colon carcinoma cell lines RKO and SW480 were
provided by the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
Texas. HT-29, HCT116, and HCT-15 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). RKO, SW480, and HT-29 cells were
maintained in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) without phenol
red supplemented with 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, 0.011% sodium pyruvate,
and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 ml/L of 100 antibiotics
antimycotic solution (Sigma). HCT116 and HCT-15 cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, 0.011%
sodium pyruvate, 0.45% glucose, 0.24% HEPES, 10% FBS, and 10 ml/L of
100 antibiotics antimycotic solution. Cells were maintained at 37jC in the
presence of 5% CO2.
Plasmids and reagents. The GAL4-Nur77 ( full-length) chimera and the
Nur77 response element-luciferase (NRE-Luc) reporter construct were
provided by Dr. Jae W. Lee (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The
GAL4 reporter containing five GAL4 response elements (pGAL4) was
provided by Dr. Marty Mayo (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC).
Antibodies for cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3,
caspase-8, caspase-9, bax, and bcl-2 were purchased from Cell Signaling
(Danvers, MA). Antibodies for Nur77, TRAIL, IgG, and h-tubulin were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the
antibody for NAG-1 was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Antibody for
cytochrome c was purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA).
Caspase inhibitor was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen,
Switzerland). h-Galactosidase (h-gal) reagent was obtained from Tropix
(Bedford, MA). Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent was from
Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). For RNA interference assays,
we used a nonspecific scrambled (iScr) oligonucleotide as described (29).
The small inhibitory RNA for Nur77 (iNur77) was identical to the reported
oligonucleotide (30), and this was purchased from Dharmacon Research
(Lafayette, CO). Leptomycin B was purchased from Sigma. The Csubstituted DIMs (C-DIMs) were synthesized in this laboratory as previously
described (20).
Transfection and luciferase assay. RKO cells were plated in 12-well
plates at 1  105 per well in DMEM/Ham’s F12 supplemented with 2.5%
charcoal-stripped FBS. After growth for 16 h, various amounts of DNA [i.e.,
Gal4Luc (0.4 Ag), h-gal (0.04 Ag), Gal4-Nur77 (0.04 Ag), and Gal4-Nur77(E/F)
chimera (0.04 Ag)] were transfected by LipofectAMINE plus reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After
5 h of transfection, cells were treated with complete media containing
either vehicle (DMSO) or the indicated ligands for 20 to 22 h. Cells were
then lysed with 100 AL of 1 reported lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI),
and 30 AL of cell extract was used for luciferase and h-gal assays.
Lumicount was used to quantitate luciferase and h-gal activities, and the
luciferase activities were normalized to h-gal activity. Results are expressed
as means F SD for at least three independent determinations for each
treatment group.
WST-1 cell proliferation assay. WST-1 assay purchased from Roche
Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN) was used to evaluate the effect of C-DIMs
on viable cell number. RKO cells were seeded in 48-well plates and treated
with DMSO and different concentrations of test compounds as indicated in
DMEM/Ham’s F-12 containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS for 24, 48, and
72 h when well plates reached 50% to 60% confluence usually at 24 h after
seeding. The cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (50 AL) was added to each
well, and cells were incubated for 0.5 h at 37jC, 5% CO2. The absorbance of

(Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The data were normalized in two steps. First, for
each array, the expression value of each gene was divided by the median of
all the values in that array. Second, for each gene, the expression value in
each array was divided by the median value of that gene across all arrays.
Genes with low-quality signals were excluded for statistical analysis. Oneway ANOVA (assume equal variances) was carried out to identify
differentially expressed genes. A gene was said to be differentially expressed
if the Benjamini and Hochberg adjusted Ps were <0.05.
Xenograft studies in athymic mice. Male athymic nude mice (Foxn1 nu,
ages 7–8 weeks) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The mice
were housed and maintained in laminar flow cabinets under specific
pathogen-free conditions. A xenograft was established by s.c. injection of
in vitro cultured RKO cells (5  106 per 150 AL) into the flanks of individual
mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 4 days until tumors were palpable.
Mice were then randomized into two groups of six mice per group and
dosed by oral gavage with either corn oil or 25 mg/kg/d DIM-C-pPHOCH3
for 21 days. The mice were weighed, and tumor size was measured twice a
week with calipers to permit calculation of tumor volumes: V = LW 2 / 2,
where L and W were length and width, respectively. Final body, organ, and
tumor weights were determined at the end of the dosing regiment, and both
organ and tumor blocks were obtained for H&E staining and histopathologic analysis.
Quantitative real-time PCR. cDNA was prepared from the RKO, SW480,
HCT116, HT-29, and HCT-15 cell lines using Reverse Transcription System
(Promega). Each PCR was carried out in triplicate in a 30-AL volume using
SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA) for 15 min at
95jC for initial denaturing, followed by 40 cycles of 95jC for 30 s and 60jC
for 1 min in the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System.
The ABI Dissociation Curves software was used following a brief thermal
protocol (95jC for 15 s and 60jC for 15 s, followed by a slow ramp to 95jC)
to control for multiple species in each PCR amplification. Values for each
gene were normalized to expression levels of TATA-binding protein. The
primers used for real-time PCR were obtained from Qiagen.

Results
Recent studies in this laboratory have identified C-DIMs
containing a p-methoxy group (DIM-C-pPhOCH3) or no substituents (DIM-C-Ph) as Nur77 agonists in pancreatic cancer cells (27).
Figure 1A shows that Nur77 protein is expressed RKO, SW480,
HCT-116, HT29, and HCT-15 colon cancer cells lines, and these
results are consistent with a previous report also showing
expression of this receptor in cell lines derived from several
different tumors (27). Nur77 expression in human colon tumors
and surrounding non-tumor tissue was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis. Figure 1B illustrates the higher levels of
brown staining (Nur77) in two colon cancer patients. Nur77 was
primarily located in the nucleus in tumor and non-tumor tissue
with only weak cytosolic staining. Immunohistochemical staining
for Nur77 in 20 colon tumor and non-tumor tissues showed that
the percentage of colon tumors that exhibited nondetectable, low,
and high Nur77 staining was 5% (1 of 20), 35% (3 of 20), and 60%
(12 of 20), respectively, whereas in normal colon tissue, the staining
pattern was 30% (6 of 20), 60% (12 of 20), and 10% (2 of 20),
respectively (e.g., Fig. 1A). These results clearly show that Nur77
protein is overexpressed in colon tumors. Due to their high
transfection efficiency, we also showed that the Nur77-active
C-DIMs induce transactivation in HCT-15 cells transfected with
GAL4-Nur77/pGAL4 (Fig. 1C) or a construct (pNRE) containing a
Nur response element (Fig. 1D). DIM-C-pPhOCH3, DIM-C-Ph, and
DIM-C-pPhCF3 all induced transactivation as previously reported
(27); however, in the following studies, we used the former two
compounds as models because DIM-C-pPhCF3 also activates
PPARg (20–24).

active C-DIMs inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in
RKO cells. Previous studies reported that apoptosis inducers cause
the translocation of Nur77 from the nucleus to the cytosol (30–33),
whereas Nur77 agonists work through the nuclear protein in
Panc28 cancer cells (27). Results in Fig. 2E illustrate that
immunostaining of RKO cells shows that in solvent (DMSO)–
treated cells, Nur77 is primarily nuclear with some weak cytosolic
staining. After treatment with 12.5 Amol/L DIM-C-pPhOCH3 for
24 h, the pattern of dominant nuclear and weak cytosolic staining
is unchanged. After preliminary studies using several concentrations of leptomycin B, a concentration of 0.5 ng/mL did not affect
PARP cleavage or nuclear Nur77 expression (Fig. 2F), whereas PARP
cleavage was induced at higher doses. It was also shown that
apoptosis (PARP cleavage) induced by DIM-C-pPhOCH3 was not
affected by leptomycin B, showing that the Nur77-dependent
apoptosis was dependent on the nuclear protein. The results are in
contrast to the effects of apoptosis inducers that act through
cytosolic Nur77, where leptomycin B inhibits their translocation

In previous studies, we showed that Nur77 agonists induced
TRAIL mRNA and protein, and this response was Nur77 dependent
and blocked after cotransfection with a small inhibitory RNA for
Nur77 (iNur77; ref. 27). Results of preliminary screening assays
showed that induction of TRAIL by Nur77-active C-DIMs in colon
cancer cells was maximal in RKO cells, and this cell line was used
as a model in our studies on Nur77-active C-DIMs. Results in
Fig. 2A and B show that DIM-C-pPhOCH3 and DIM-C-Ph (10 and
15 Amol/L, respectively) inhibit cell growth after treatment for
24, 48, or 72 h, and the maximum inhibitory response was observed
after 72 h, where there was considerable cell detachment and dead
cells. The growth-inhibitory effects observed for these compounds
after 72 h were also accompanied by several markers of apoptosis,
including PARP cleavage and cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and
caspase-8 (Fig. 2C). PARP cleavage was also observed after
treatment of RKO cells for 48 h with DIM-C-Ph and DIM-CpPhOCH3, and this response was blocked by the pancaspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2D). These results show that Nur77-

group was determined in triplicate. After treatment with DMSO or
12.5 Amol/L DIM-C-pPhOCH3 for 2 and 6 h, we analyzed gene
expression from the microarray data and identified several induced
genes associated with apoptosis and ER stress. This latter response
was not surprising because DIMs and C-DIMs induce ER stress in
other cancer cell lines. In addition, we also observed activation of
genes (by z2-fold) associated with metabolism and homeostasis,
transport, kinase activity and signal transduction, transcription,
protein folding, and modification and genes with several other
functions (Table 1). We further examined three of the most highly
induced proapoptotic genes after treatment of RKO cells with DIMC-pPhOCH3 for 6 h [i.e., PDCD1 (5.2-fold), CSE (5.6-fold), and ATF3
(4.6-fold)]. RT-PCR analysis shows that 12.5 Amol/L DIM-CpPhOCH3 induced PDCD1, CSE, and ATF3 (Fig. 4A), and based
on replicate (3) experiments, all three genes are significantly
induced in RKO cells (Fig. 4B). In cells cotransfected with iScr or
iNur77, the induction of PDCD1 is blocked by iNUR77 (Fig. 4C),
whereas induction of CSE and ATF3 are unaffected by iNur77 and
represent receptor-independent responses. A comparison of

from the nucleus to the cytosol, and this results in activation of cell
death pathways (30, 31).
Figure 3A and B illustrates the time-dependent induction of
TRAIL protein by 12.5 Amol/L DIM-C-pPhOCH3 and 15 Amol/L
DIM-C-pH, respectively, and significant induction was first
observed after 48 and 24 h, respectively. The concentrations used
in this experiment were selected to give a maximal induction
response with minimal cytotoxicity. The role of Nur77 in mediating
the induced proapoptotic responses was confirmed by RNA

knockdown decreased Nur77 protein (Fig. 3C and D). Moreover,
DIM-C-pPhOCH3–induced TRAIL protein expression and PARP
cleavage (Fig. 3C and E) were also significantly inhibited in cells
transfected with iNur77. These results show that proapoptotic
responses induced by Nur77 agonists were dependent on Nur77
protein.

CSE by DIM-C-pPhOCH3 also depended on cell context. ATF3 was
constitutively expressed or induced in all cell lines and most
prominently induced in HT-29 cells. The pattern of CSE expression
was similar to that of PDCD1 except for HCT-116 cells where CSE
was constitutively expressed but not induced. Results illustrated in

Fig. 4E show that 12.5 Amol/L DIM-C-pPhOCH3 induced apoptosis
(PARP cleavage) in RKO, SW480, HCT-116, and HT-29 cells but not
in HCT-15 cells. The failure to induce apoptosis in HCT-15 cells
correlates with the lack of induction of PDCD1 and CSE in this
cell line.
The effects of DIM-C-pPhOCH3 (25 mg/kg/d) on colon tumor
growth were also investigated in athymic nude mice bearing RKO
cell xenografts. Treatment with the Nur77 agonist significantly
decreased tumor volumes (Fig. 5A) and final tumor weights
(Fig. 5B) compared with corn oil controls. Extensive examination of
body weight, organ weights, and H&E staining showed that there
were no significant differences between corn oil– and DIM-CpPhOCH3–treated animals. Representative H&E-stained histopathology sections of colon tumors from the control (Fig. 5C and D)
and treated (Fig. 5E and F) mice were also examined. Tumors from
untreated mice consisted of minimally encapsulated (dashed
arrow), abundant dense expansile nests of epithelial-to-mesenchymal–appearing cells with marked atypical cytologic features, such
as anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, single to multiple variably sized
nucleoli, nuclear molding, and binucleation. Mitotic figures were
frequently noted within the neoplastic cells (arrows). Some of the
neoplastic cells were vacuolated (empty areas) with few areas of
necrosis. A fine amount of stroma occasionally dissecting the
tumor was also observed. Tumors from treated mice (Fig. 5E
and F) consisted of similar population of neoplastic cells. However,
there was abundant necrosis noted within the tumor cells, and
mitotic figures seemed to significantly decreased. Areas within the
circle represent necrotic components of the tumor. TRAIL protein
was overexpressed in tumors from treated animals but not in
tumors from animals receiving corn oil alone; however, this was not
consistently observed in all tumors (data not shown). These studies

clearly show that the Nur77 agonist DIM-C-pPhOCH3 exhibits
antitumorigenic activity in both in vivo and in vitro models, and
these results, coupled with the overexpression of Nur77 in human
colon tumors (Fig. 1C), suggest that this orphan receptor is a target
for colon cancer chemotherapy.

Discussion
Nur77 is an NGFI-B orphan receptor and a member of the
nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. Nur77 is
expressed in multiple tissues; Nurr1 has been detected in thymus
osteoblasts, liver, and pituitary gland, and Nor1 is highly expressed
in the pituitary gland with low expression in other tissues (34–38).
The physiologic roles for NGFI-B proteins are not fully understood;
however, gene-targeting knockout experiments show several
important functions of these proteins that correlate, in part, with
other in vitro and in vivo studies. For example, Nurr1 knockout
mice have severe impairments in midbrain neuronal development
and dopamine expression, and these animals die soon after birth
(39, 40). A recent study reports that Nor1 knockout animals die at
gestation day 5, showing an important role for this protein in early
embryogenesis (41). In contrast, Nur77 knockout mice do not
exhibit a specific phenotype (42), and this may be related to
coexpression of both Nur77/Nor1, which exhibit some overlapping
functions. Nur77 plays an important role in thymocyte-negative
selection and in T-cell receptor–mediated apoptosis in thymocytes,
and overexpression of Nur77 in transgenic mice resulted in high
levels of apoptosis in thymocytes (43, 44).
Li et al. (31) reported that treatment of LNCaP prostate cancer

pressed in human colorectal tumors compared with non-tumor
tissue (Fig. 1B). Results of initial screening studies in colon
cancer cells showed that DIM-C-pPhOCH3 and DIM-C-Ph
strongly induced TRAIL in RKO cells (8- to 15-fold), and this
cell line was used as a model to investigate the growthinhibitory and apoptotic effects of Nur77-active DIM-C-pPhOCH3
and DIM-C-Ph.
Both Nur77-active C-DIMs decreased cell proliferation and
induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in RKO cells (Fig. 2), and
this was accompanied by the induction of TRAIL (Fig. 3A and B).
Moreover, using RNA interference, we also showed that decreased
Nur77 expression by RNA interference was accompanied by
significant inhibition of PARP cleavage and induction of TRAIL
(Fig. 3C–E). These results parallel previous studies in pancreatic
cancer cell lines (27) and confirm that ligand-dependent activation
of Nur77 was required for the proapoptotic responses induced by
DIM-C-pPhOCH3 and DIM-C-Ph. Moreover, these responses were
not blocked by the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (Fig. 2F)
as previously reported for several apoptosis-inducing agents
(30–33), and Nur77 was primarily a nuclear protein in the presence
or absence of agonists (Fig. 2E). In contrast to the important
extranuclear function of Nur77 in mediating the induction of
cell death by inducers of apoptosis (30–33), Nur77 agonists induce
cell death through nuclear pathways that include the induction
of TRAIL.

resulted in induction of Nur77 gene expression. Surprisingly,
induction of apoptosis and cytochrome c release from the
mitochondria was independent of the DNA-binding domain of
Nur77. Treatment with leptomycin B (a blocker of nuclear export)
inhibited induction of Nur77-dependent apoptosis. Using a series of
wild-type and deletion GFP-Nur77 constructs, it was clear that
induction of apoptosis by these agents was accompanied by
translocation of Nur77 from the nucleus to the mitochondria.
Moreover, Nur77 specifically interacts with Bcl-2 and converts Bcl-2
into a proapoptotic factor in HEK293T and HCT-116 cells (30).
Nur77 translocation from the nucleus has been observed in several
cell lines with inducers of apoptosis (30–33). However, a recent
study in colon cancer cells reported that butyrate-induced
apoptosis was associated with nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation
of Nur77, which is not accompanied by subsequent mitochondrial
interactions (45).
A report from this laboratory showed that Nur77 was widely
expressed in cancer cell lines, and DIM-C-pPhCF3, DIM-C-Ph,
and DIM-C-pPhOCH3 were characterized as Nur77 agonists,
which activated Nur77-dependent transactivation in pancreatic
cancer cell lines (27). In this study, we used DIM-C-pPhOCH3
and DIM-C-Ph as prototypical Nur77 agonists and show that
these compounds activated Nur77 in colon cancer cell lines (Fig.
1C and D). Nur77 was also expressed in RKO, SW480, HCT-116,
HT-29, and HCT-15 colon cancer cells (Fig. 1A) and overex-

effects of CSE in some cells may be due to the effects of H2S
(51, 52). Both ATF3 and CSE are induced by DIM-C-pPhOCH3 in
RKO cells (Fig. 4A and B) and are differentially expressed and
induced in the five colon cancer cell lines (Fig. 4D). RNA
interference studies show that CSE and ATF3 are induced through
receptor-independent pathways (Fig. 4C), and these results parallel
studies on other responses that are induced by Nur77-active
C-DIMs through receptor-dependent and receptor-independent
pathways (Fig. 3; data not shown). Interestingly, SW480 and HCT-15
cells were most resistant to DIM-C-pPhOCH3–induced apoptosis
(PARP cleavage), and this result correlated with minimal to
nondetectable induction of CSE and PDCD1 in both cell lines.
Current studies are investigating DIM-C-pPhOCH3–induced genes,
which are required for induction of apoptosis by this compound.
These results show that Nur77 agonists inhibit RKO cell growth
through multiple pathways, and in vivo studies using athymic nude
mice bearing RKO cell xenografts show that DIM-C-pPhOCH3
(25 mg/kg/d) also inhibits colon tumor growth and weight (Fig. 5),
and this result complements results of in vitro studies with this
compound. Moreover, we did not observe any toxicity of this
compound based on body or organ weights and extensive
histopathology of various organs/tissues (Fig. 5C–F).
In summary, this study shows that Nur77-active C-DIMs inhibit
growth and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines, and Nur77
is overexpressed in human colorectal adenocarcinomas. In contrast
to apoptosis-inducing agents (30–33) that induce nuclear to
cytosolic translocation of Nur77, the receptor-dependent and
receptor-independent responses induced by Nur77-active C-DIMs
are not related to altered subcellular distribution of Nur77, which is
primarily located in the nucleus. Current studies are focused on
identification of other critical genes induced by Nur77-active
C-DIMs in colon cancer cell lines and on their cell context– and
time-dependent contributions to activation of cell death. Moreover,
because Nur77 is overexpressed in colon tumors (Fig. 1B), the
Nur77-active C-DIMs are also being developed as a novel class of
anticancer drugs for treatment of colon cancer.

The results of RNA interference studies (Fig. 3C) suggest that
although Nur77 plays a role in DIM-C-pPhOCH3–induced apoptosis, it was evident that induction of receptor-independent
proapoptotic responses may also be important. Previous studies
with PPARg-active C-DIMs show that these compounds activate
other proapoptotic responses, including induction of ER stress,
modulation of kinase pathways, and induction of the transforming
growth factor-h–like peptide NAG-1 (20–24). Initial studies showed
that although both DIM-C-pPhOCH3 and DIM-C-Ph induced TRAIL
within 24 or 48 h after treatment, respectively (Fig. 3A and B);
PARP cleavage was also observed 12 to 24 h after treatment, and we
also observed that DIM-C-pPhOCH3 and DIM-C-Ph decreased
mitochondrial membrane potential (data not shown). These results
suggest that some of the proapoptotic effects of the Nur77-active
C-DIMs were receptor independent, and the pathways associated
with these responses are currently being investigated.
We also used the Amersham Biosciences CodeLink human whole
genome array to further investigate genes induced by DIM-CpPhOCH3 within 2 and 6 h after treatment. This approach would
not detect TRAIL, which is a late-inducible gene, but should
identify other genes associated with both receptor-dependent and
receptor-independent pathways. Analysis by GeneSpring showed
that several different functional categories of genes were induced
or decreased after treatment with DIM-C-pPhOCH3 for 2 or
6 h (Table 1, induced genes), and we initially focused on three
proapoptotic genes that were the most highly induced genes after
6 h. DIM-C-pPhOCH3 induced expression of PDCD1, CSE, and
ATF3 by 5.3-, 5.6-, and 4.6-fold, respectively, as determined in the
microarray experiments (in triplicate), and the induction responses
were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4A and B). PDCD1
has previously been characterized as a proapoptotic gene (46), and,
in pancreatic cancer cells, PDCD1 is overexpressed in a welldifferentiated cell line compared with a poorly differentiated cell
line (47). In this study, we show that induction of PDCD1 by DIMC-pPhOCH3 is Nur77 dependent (Fig. 4C) and is induced in RKO,
HCT-116, and HT-29 but not SW480 or HCT-15 colon cancer cells
(Fig. 4D).
ATF3 is a stress-responsive transcription factor induced by
different classes of compounds, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in colon and other cancer cell lines, and
exhibits growth inhibitory and proapoptotic activity (48–50). In
contrast, CSE acts primarily through catalyzing formation of
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from cysteine, and the growth-inhibitory
