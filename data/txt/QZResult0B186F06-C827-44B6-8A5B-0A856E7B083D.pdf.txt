ABSTRACT
An oncolytic poxvirus such as vvDD-CXCL11 can generate potent systemic
antitumor immunity as well as targeted oncolysis, yet the antitumor effect is limited
probably due to limited homing to and suppressed activity of tumor-specific adaptive
immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We reasoned that a chemokine
modulating (CKM) drug cocktail, consisting of IFN-α, poly I:C, and a COX-2 inhibitor,
may skew the chemokine (CK) and cytokine profile into a favorable one in the TME,
and this pharmaceutical modulation would enhance both the trafficking into and
function of antitumor immune cells in the TME, thus increasing therapeutic efficacy
of the oncolytic virus. In this study we show for the first time in vivo that the CKM
modulates the CK microenvironment but it does not modulate antitumor immunity
by itself in a MC38 colon cancer model. Sequential treatment with the virus and then
CKM results in the upregulation of Th1-attracting CKs and reduction of Treg-attracting
CKs (CCL22 and CXCL12), concurrent with enhanced trafficking of tumor-specific CD8+
T cells and NK cells into the TME, thus resulting in the most significant antitumor
activity and long term survival of tumor-bearing mice. This novel combined regimen,
with the oncolytic virus (vvDD-CXCL11) inducing direct oncolysis and eliciting potent
antitumor immunity, and the CKM inducing a favorable chemokine profile in the TME
that promotes the trafficking and function of antitumor Tc1/Th1 and NK cells, may
have great utility for oncolytic immunotherapy for cancer.

Pexa-Vec (JX-594), a Wyeth strain oncolytic VV, which
has minimal therapy-associated toxicities and demonstrated
objective clinical responses in human cancer patients [5, 6].
We have previously demonstrated that the WR strain of
oncolytic vaccinia virus vvDD, with dual deletions of viral
genes encoding thymidine kinase (tk) and vaccinia growth
factor (vgf), is a tumor-selective replicating and potent
OV in animal models [7]. The virus is safe in non-human
primates and human patients [8, 9]. However, further
improvements are needed in order for the oncolytic VV to
be highly efficacious. Investigators have worked to improve
the efficacy of the virus in different ways, such as arming

INTRODUCTION
Oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) has demonstrated
significant promise in both preclinical studies and clinical
trials [1], and correlative studies confirm that OVT is a
new form of immunotherapy for cancer [2–4]. In the last
few years, more and more research groups have devoted
their attention to vaccinia virus (VV) as an oncolytic virus
(OV). This has been attributed to the unique properties of
VV, especially its native tumor tropism, efficient cell-cell
spread and high levels of transgene expression in tumor
cells. The most advanced clinical developments are from

explants in vitro [41]. If this effect could be reproduced in
a tumor-bearing host in vivo, the application of the drugs
may be a great way to modulate the TME and promote the
trafficking of tumor-specific effector T cells and NK cells into
the tumor tissues, thus enhancing the therapeutic efficacy.
We reasoned that OV would induce an acute
inflammatory signal in the TME, prime DCs with danger
signal along with TAAs and activate tumor antigenspecific adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the draining
lymph nodes and in circulation; while CKM would
modulate the CK microenvironment leading to increased
immunostimulatory CKs such as CCL5 and CXCL10,
and concurrent reduction of immunosuppressive CKs
(CCL22 and CXCL12). These effects would promote
the trafficking of antitumor Th1/Teff cells into tumors
and retain their functions in the TME, thus enhancing the
overall immunotherapeutic efficacy. In the current study,
we present data to support this hypothesis. Our results
demonstrate that this rational combination of a potent
oncolytic virus (vvDD-CXCL11) with a drug cocktail for
tumor-selective reprogramming of the CK profile in the
TME enhanced the oncolytic immunotherapy in a model
of syngeneic colorectal cancer.

it with another immunostimulatory genes [2, 3, 10], such
as cytokine (e.g. CD40L; IL-10) [11, 12], chemokine (e.g.
CCL5) [13]. Combination strategies may further enhance
both the efficacy and safety of this oncolytic virus [14, 15].
Previous studies have shown that the number of
infiltrated CD8+ T cells is a good prognostic factor in
human colorectal cancer [16–18], while a high density
of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3+ Treg cells is associated
with poor outcome in a number of solid cancer types,
including ovarian [19], pancreatic [20], and hepatocellular
carcinomas [21, 22]. One major factor affecting the
infiltration of immune cells into the tumor niche is
the CK profile and concentrations in the TME, and the
expression of corresponding CK receptors on the surface
of the immune cells [23, 24]. Therefore, trafficking to
and accumulation of antitumor CD8+ T cells in the tumor
tissue, would be expected to enhance the therapeutic
efficacy of immunotherapy including OVT.
In order to enhance the trafficking of antitumor Tc1/
Th1 cells into the TME, expression of Tc1/Th1-attracting
CKs from a tumor-selective OV cells is a reasonable
strategy. It has been known that CKs play important roles
in cancer, such as intracellular signaling and intercellular
communication in the TME, tumor cell migration and
invasion, as well as trafficking of immune cells [23,
24]. CXCL11, also called I-TAC, a ligand for receptors
CXCR3 and CXCR7, attracts CD8+ T cells and NK cells
to the tumor or other inflamed sites [25–27]. It has potent
antitumor activity in vivo involving attraction of CD8+
T lymphocytes [26]. Fc-fused CXCL11 could function
as a strong adjuvant to enhance antigen-specific CD8+ T
cell responses [28]. CXCL11 can also bind to a different
variant of CXCR3 receptor and mediate inhibition of
endothelial cells and thus tumor angiogenesis [29]. We
have constructed an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing
murine CXCL11, vvDD-CXCL11 [30].
The multifaceted TME influences viral infection,
replication, and propagation within the tumor, as well as
antiviral and antitumor immune responses, and thus has
a huge impact on OVT [31–35]. Cancer cells infected
by an oncolytic poxvirus undergo programmed necrosis
and apoptosis with release of ATP, HMGB1 as well as
immunogenic endoplasmic reticulum chaperone gp96, all
danger signals to the innate immune system, making it a
type of immunogenic cell death (ICD) [36–39]. This ICD
together with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) released
from dying cancer cells may prime for a potentially potent
antitumor immunity [2]. The next challenge is to control
T cell trafficking to the tumor sites [40]. In addition to
virally-directed expression of Tc1/Th1-attracting CKs, we
have recently found that a CK modulation (CKM) drug
cocktail including IFN-α, poly I:C, and a cyclooxygenase
(COX)-2 inhibitor, could enhance the production of Tc1/
Th1-attracting CKs such as CCL5 and CXCL10, greatly
reduce the production of CCL22, a CK associated with
infiltration of regulatory T cells (Treg) in human tumor tissue

RESULTS
Increased tumor growth and decreased survival
in CXCR3-knockout mice
CXCR3 is expressed primarily on activated T
lymphocytes and NK cells [42]. CXCR3 binds to the
CXC subclass of CKs including CXCL11, as well as
CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL4 (for CXCR3-B only) [29,
43]. These CKs play important roles in the trafficking of
activated T and NK cells into tumor tissues. Therefore we
wondered if tumor growth of MC38 colon cancer would be
affected in CXCR3 knockout mice. MC38-luc colorectal
cancer grew faster in CXCR3-/- mice than the wild type
mice, as shown by parameters in both optical light imaging
and real tumor burden (weight) (Figure 1; panels A and
B). Not surprisingly, MC38-luc tumor-bearing CXCR3/- mice lived shorter than those of wild type mice (Figure
1C). These results suggested that one or more ligands for
CXCR3 are important to the inhibition of tumor growth,
most likely for their functions in promoting trafficking to
tumors and activating T and NK cells in the tumor tissue.

Construction and initial characterization of the
new vvDD-CXCL11
Thus, we were interested in overexpressing one
of the CXCR3 ligands in the tumor tissues, which could
attract CXCR3-expressing Tc1/Th1 and NK cells from
circulation into the TME and subsequently activate them. We
picked CXCL11 and made a new oncolytic VV expressing
murine CXCL11, as described in Materials and Methods

(Figure 2A). The new virus replicates as well as the parental
virus in MC38 colon cancer cells (Figure 2B). The high
levels of CXCL11 secreted from infected MC38 cancer
cells were determined in vitro and in MC38 tumors in vivo
as determined by ELISA assays (Figure 2C and 2D). These
results demonstrated that vvDD-CXCL11 is a replicating
oncolytic virus and it secrets functional CXCL11 from
infected cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

We observed significantly increased infiltration of CD8+
T cells in tumors from mice treated with vvDD-CXCL11,
as shown by both IHC (Figure 3A) of the tumor tissues
and real-time RT-PCR on total RNA extracted from the
tumor tissues for markers CD8 and NKG2D (Figure 3B).
Surprisingly, the increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells did
not translate into better therapeutic efficacy as animals
treated with either virus survived with similar kinetics,
even though the mice treated with either virus survived
longer than those treated with PBS saline (Figure 3C).

CXCL11 expression from the virus increases
recruitment of CD8+ T cells, but has little
effect on tumor growth

CKM modulates the immunological TME yet
little effect on host survival

We then tested the effects of the armed virus in
comparison to the parental virus on the trafficking of
CD8+ T cells and NK cells, as well as the inhibition of
tumor growth and animal survival in tumor-bearing mice.

We have previously shown that CKM cocktail can
modulate the immunological properties of the TME using
a tumor tissue explant culture system [41]. This includes

enhanced production of CKs CCL5 and CXCL10, and
reduced production of CCL22/MDC, a CK associated with
infiltration of Treg. In this study, we have now applied this
CKM cocktail in a tumor model in vivo for the first time.
As a preliminary experiment, we examined intratumoral
mRNA levels for CD3, CD8, Granzyme B, and CXCL11
after treatment with PBS, 1 dose of CKM, or 2 doses of
CKM using Real-time RT-PCR analyses. CD3, CD8, and
CXCL11 mRNA levels were increased after 2 doses of CKM
compared to PBS. Granzyme B was increased with two doses
of CKM compared to one dose (Figure 4A). Despite these
encouraging indicators, 6 doses of CKM treatment alone did
not show any benefit in survival of the animals (Figure 4B).

recruitment of immune cells, and antitumor potency
in comparison to either monotherapy alone. First we
analyzed the profiles of five important immunological
markers, three CKs and two cytokines (Figure 5A). For
CCL5, CXCL9 and IFN-γ, the virus vvDD-CXCL11 alone
induced their expression while CKM did not. CKM did
induce a moderate level of CXCL11 expression, while
the armed virus expressed high levels of CXCL11 from
the transgene in the virus as expected. The dual treatment
maintained high levels of CCL5 and CXCL9 as in CKM
treatment, a high level of IFN-γ as in virus treatment, and
elevated CXCL11 expression. Thus, dual treatment led
to equal or higher levels of expression of inflammatory
CKs and IFN-γ. Interestingly, virus slightly inhibited the
production of IL-10, but addition of CKM restored the IL10 production to the base level.
We then examined the cellular markers in responses
to either monotherapy or dual therapy (Figure 5B). There
was little change of CD4 marker in the tumor tissue in
responses to either monotherapy. However, dual treatment
showed a trend of increased CD4+ cells (due to small

We then explored the potential of the combination
regimen on the TME, especially the profile of the CKs,

number of animals studied, p value was insignificant).
As for CD8 expression, an increase was seen in the virus
treatment group, but not with CKM treatment. Dual
treatment led to significant enhancement of CD8+ cells
(p < 0.05). For the activating marker granzyme B (GzmB)
and NKG2D (for both T and NK cells), virus treatment
and dual treatment, but not CKM alone, tended to increase
expression of both markers. This might indicate that the
combination led to not only enhanced infiltration of
CD8+ T and/or NK cells, but also activated state as both
activating makers were expressed at higher levels. As a
control, COX-2 mRNA has not been changed with either
mono- or dual treatments, but this is expected as celecoxib
in the CKM is for the inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic
function, not transcription of the gene. While validation
using cell sorting of tumor infiltrating leucocytes would
confirm these results, it was not feasible due to the small
size of the peritoneal tumors at this time point.
We also examined the effects on tumor-promoting
markers related to Treg cells, including CCL22 [44],
CXCL12 [45] and FoxP3 (Figure 5C). The virus tended
to induce the immunosuppressive CCL22 and CXCL12
and had no much effect on FoxP3, the cellular marker for
Treg cells. However, the CKM cocktail tended to inhibit

expression of CCL22, CXXL12, as well as FoxP3 in our
in vivo tumor model. In the dual treatment, the addition
of CKM reduced the virus-induced expression of CCL22
and FoxP3. We have also seen a trend towards reduction
of virus-induced CXCL12 by the treatment with CKM.
In summary, the addition of the CKM to the virus
treatment promoted the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as IFN-γ, CKs such as CCL5, CXCL9
and CXCL11, enhanced the numbers of CD4+ and
CD8+ immune cells and the immune cell activation
marker (NKG2D), while inhibiting the production of
immunosuppressive CKs (CCL22, CXCL12) and the
infiltration of Treg cells. These effects may lead to potent
induction and function of antitumor immunity in the TME.

few IFN-γ producing tumor-specific cells (mainly CD8+ T
cells, CD4+ T cells and NK cells) in control mice treated
with PBS saline. Virus-treated mice produced increased
tumor-specific IFN-γ producing immune cells, while
PBS or CKM treatment led to little, if any, production
of tumor-specific IFN-γ-producing immune cells. The
combination treatment of CKM and the virus led to a high
level of production of tumor-specific IFN-γ+ immune cells,
comparable to those treated with the virus alone. We have
also performed an ELISA assay to quantify the amounts of
IFN-γ in the supernatants of the co-cultures of splenocytes
and irradiated MC38 cancer cells (Figure 6C). The results
showed that splenocytes from naïve mice, PBS or CKMtreated mice secreted very low levels of IFN-γ while the
splenocytes from mice treated with virus alone or the
combination secreted much higher levels of IFN-γ (Figure
6C). Thus, both ELISPOT and ELISA assays indicated the
same pattern of immunological activation. These results,
together with the previous data, strongly suggest that
the CXCL11-expressing oncolytic virus elicited potent
systemic antitumor immunity, while the CKM targeted the
tumor immunological microenvironment, promoting the
trafficking of antitumor immune cells into the tumor and
maintaining their antitumor activity, with little direct effect
on the initial step of activation of antitumor immune cells.
Finally, we examined the effects of the combination
therapy on tumor growth and survival (Figure 6D).

In the MC38-luc-bearing mice, PBS control therapy
was associated with a median survival of 34 days. CKM
treatment alone did not benefit the tumor-bearing mice.
Mice treated with vvDD-CXCL11 survived longer
(median survival 48 days), demonstrating the therapeutic
effect of the virus. The most dramatic effect on survival
was associated with the combination treatment, where the
median survival extended to at least 115 days.

DISCUSSION
It has previously been demonstrated that oncolytic
poxvirus induced infected cancer cells into programmed
necrosis and apoptosis with release of ATP, HMGB1 as
well as immunogenic endoplasmic reticulum chaperone
gp96, all danger signals to the innate immune system [36–
39] and key signals for induction of antitumor immunity
[2, 46, 47]. We have previously shown the improved results
of oncolytic vaccinia viruses armed with the chemokines
CCL5 or CCL19 compared to the parent VV [13]. While
those armed viruses were more effective than the parental
virus, they also demonstrated improved results when
combined with an alpha dendritic cells-mediated cancer
vaccine or adoptive transfer of CIK cells. In a recent
manuscript, we identified vvDD-CXCL11 as having the
unique property of inducing high levels of autologous
tumor-reactive splenocytes in an immunogenic tumor

(AB12 mesothelioma) and functioning in the induction
phase of the immune response [30]. Because of the
increased systemic anti-tumor immunity, we felt it would
be ideal to combine this effect in a non-immunogenic tumor
with a regimen that modifies the tumor microenvironment
and enhances effector cell trafficking.
In the current study, we have moved one step
forward and demonstrated that vvDD-CXCL11 exerted
oncolysis, elicited potent systemic adaptive antitumor
immunity, and attracted CD8+ T-cells into the TME.
However, we have also shown that this anticancer activity
by itself is not enough for high therapeutic efficacy. Our
data suggests that this is explained by the observation
that the immunosuppressive TME inhibited the cytotoxic
function of the infiltrated immune cells and that the virus
may induce immunosuppressive factors.
A number of studies have shown that the modulation
of the immunological TME is critical in immunotherapy
regimens. As discussed previously, our prior work
demonstrated that a drug cocktail consisting of IFN-α, poly

I:C, and Celebrex (a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor),
could enhance the production of immunostimulatory CKs
(such as CCL5 and CXCL10), and reduce the production
of immunosuppressive CK CCL22 (Treg attractant)
in human tumor tissue explants in vitro [41]. All three
drugs were required for uniform effects. We applied this
cocktail to the in vivo tumor model for the first time here
and showed that CKM indeed modulated the TME into
a favorable microenvironment for antitumor immunity in
vivo. The combinatorial regimen generated a favorable
cytokine and chemokine profile, as indicated by higher
levels of IFNγ, IL-10, CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL11, and
reduced levels of CCL22 and CXCL12. As a result, we
observed higher levels of NKG2D (an activation marker
for T and NK cells), granzyme B (a cytotoxicity marker
for T and NK cells), and a lower level of FOXP3 (a
marker for Treg cells). Further analyses indicated that
the virus itself elicited a higher level of systemic antitumor vaccination, as indicated by increased tumor
specific IFN-γ secreting immune cells (T and NK cells),

while CKM did not. These combined effects led to potent
antitumor activity and significantly prolonged survival in
MC38-tumor bearing mice.
It is important to point out that the immunogenicity
of the tumor model would greatly affect the outcome
with the combination regimen. We have recently studied
vvDD-CXCL11 in the murine AB12 mesothelioma model
which is highly immunogenic [48]. In that model, the
oncolytic virus alone, without CKM, was quite efficacious
[30]. It is easy to speculate that the immunologic TME

is more favorable for elicitation of antitumor immunity
in an immunogenic tumor (such as AB12 mesothelioma),
and thus CKM treatment would become functionally
redundant and thus play marginal effect in further
improving the oncolytic therapeutic efficacy. Given that
most solid human tumors are non-immunogenic, the
combination of vvDD-CXCL11 and CKM may provide
a mechanism to impact both the induction and effector
phases of anti-tumor immunity and produce an effective
anti-tumor immune response. However, more models need

to be examined before we can provide a solid conclusion
on this hypothesis.
In summary, we have rationally developed a
combination strategy to produce a highly efficacious
therapeutic regimen to treat a colorectal carcinomatosis
model in syngeneic mice. The oncolytic virus exerts its
intrinsic capacity of oncolysis, CXCL11 expression leads
to systemic adaptive antitumor immunity and attraction of
cytotoxic T-cells, while the CKM cocktail modulates the
TME to one immunologically favorable with CK profile
skewing toward attracting Th1/Tc1 cells, enhancing the
attraction of activated Tc1/Th1 cells and NK cells, and
sustained activity of attracted immune cells to destroy
cancer cells in the TME. This novel combinatorial regimen
may be efficacious for treating non-immunogenic human
tumors in late stages of disease.

48 and 72 h after viral infection. The cell pellets were
homogenized using a Precellys 24 Tissue Homogenizer/
Grinder (Bertin Technologies, Rockville, MD), to release
virions. The infectious viruses in the resulting cell lysates
were titered on CV-1 cells, and expressed as plaque
forming unit (pfu) per mL.

model, live animal imaging, treatments and
survival monitoring
CXCR3-knock-out mice (B6.129P2-Cxcr3tm1Dgen/J)
were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
ME). Female C57BL/6 mice, about 6 weeks old, were
obtained from Taconic Biosciences, Inc. (Germantown, NY).
All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the University.
The MC38-luc PC model was established by
injection of 5.0 x 105 MC38-luc cells i.p. into C57BL/6
mice. Tumor establishment and progression was
monitored by live animal IVIS imaging right before the
injection of the virus and various days afterwards. The
in vivo optical imaging in living animals was performed
using a Xenogen IVIS 200 Optical In Vivo Imaging
System (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA),
with technical assistance from the Small Animal Imaging
Core Facility.
The viruses (at 5.0E8 pfu/mouse/0.5 mL) were
given i.p. on day 7 post tumor cell inoculation. The
CK-modulating (CKM) drug cocktail was made freshly.
Each mouse was injected i.p. with 200 uL of the CKM
solution (containing 10,000 U of IFN-α, 50 mg of
polyI:C, and 0.075 mg of Celecoxib). Unless indicated
otherwise, the injection was taken place on days 11, 12,
15, 16, 19, and 20 (injection for two days and rest for
two days). IFN-α was obtained from PBL Biomedical
Labs (Piscataway, NJ), poly I:C from Sigma (St Louis,
MO) and celecoxib from Biovision Inc (San Francisco,
CA).
The health and survival of treated and mocktreated mice was closely monitored. All mice subjected
to peritoneal tumors were monitored via caliper
measurements for changes in abdominal girth. There
are two criteria for death of animals: natural death due
to the disease or any animal in which abdominal girth
exceeded 1.5x the original measurement was euthanized
and recorded as a death [51].

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cell lines were maintained in
an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Recombinant VV
WR strain derived recombinant viruses have been
used in this study. vSC20, the virus with mutation in
the vgf loci, was used to infect CV-1 cells, which were
then transfected with a tk shuttle vector containing
the expression cassette for murine CXCL11. The
recombinant virus vvDD-CXCL11 was selected by DsRed
expression and flow sorting and multiple rounds of plaque
purification. After three rounds of plaque purification in
96-well plates, viral DNA from individual plaque was
extracted and the inserted sequence was confirming by
DNA sequencing. The control virus vvDD-CD (with yeast
fcy1 gene) has been previously described [50].

Viral replication assays in vitro

ELISA assay for quantification of murine
CXCL11

Viral replication assays were performed as
previously described [37, 51]. Briefly, 1.0 x 105 MC38luc cells, in 6-well plates were infected with vvDD or
vvDD-CXCL11 at MOIs of 0.1, 1.0 or 10 in 1 ml of 2%
FBS-containing-Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) for 2 h at 37°C. Following infection, cells were
cultured in DMEM-10% FBS until harvesting at 12, 24,

The concentration of CXCL11 in the supernatants
of cancer cell culture or tissue lysate of tumor tissues
was quantified using mouse CXCL11 Duoset ELISA
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R & D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

The assays were performed essentially as described
[52]. Briefly, plates were coated with 100 mL of 15 mg/
ml of anti-mouse IFN-γ mAb (clone AN18, Mabtech Inc.,
Cincinnati, OH). Splenocytes (5.0E5 cells/well) were
restimulated with γ-irradiated (10,000 rad) MC38-luc cells
(1.0E5 cells/well) for 24 h. After appropriate washes, 100
mL of 1.0 mg/mL biotinylated secondary antibody (clone
R4-6A2-biotin, Mabtech, Inc.) in 0.5% FBS-containing
PBS was added and incubated at room temperature for 2
h. The spots were developed by using Vecstatin Elite ABC
kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA).

TaqMan qPCR analysis of mRNA expression

REFERENCES

Unless specified otherwise, for in vivo experiments,
mice were sacrificed and tumor tissues were harvested
for purification of total RNA at 48 h after final treatment.
Tumor cells or biopsied tissues were placed in Lysing
Matrix D Tubes (MP Biologicals) containing RLT buffer
from RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and agitated using
a FP120 homogenizer (MP Biologicals, Santa Ana, CA).
After spin supernatants from the lysis matrix tubes were
transferred into new tubes. The total RNA was extracted
using the RNeasy kit. One microgram of total RNA was
used for cDNA synthesis, and 25 to 50 ng of cDNA was
used for TaqMan PCR analysis for levels of individual
mRNAs on the StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA), as we have described previously [41].
The TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays for individual
genes including primers were obtained from the Applied
Biosystems. The house-keeping gene hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) was used as a reference
gene for the mRNA levels of genes of interest.

Immunohistochemistry
At day 12 post tumor cell implantation and 2 days
after virus treatment, tumor tissues were harvested. The
tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in
paraffin. 10 micrometer sections were cut using a microtome,
and placed on slides. CD8 immunohistochemistry was
performed following the established protocols using the
Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA). CD8 primary antibody was used at 1:50 dilution, and
biotinylated anti rat secondary antibody at 1:100 dilution.
