Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are approximately 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate protein-coding gene
expression in a sequence-specific manner via translational
inhibition or mRNA degradation. Our recent studies showed
that miRNAs exhibit genomic alterations at a high frequency
and their expression is remarkably deregulated in ovarian
cancer, strongly suggesting that miRNAs are involved in the
initiation and progression of this disease. In the present study,
we performed miRNA microarray to identify the miRNAs
associated with chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer and
found that let-7i expression was significantly reduced in
chemotherapy-resistant patients (n = 69, P = 0.003). This result
was further validated by stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR (n = 62, P = 0.015). Both loss-of-function (by synthetic
let-7i inhibitor) and gain-of-function (by retroviral overexpression of let-7i) studies showed that reduced let-7i expression
significantly increased the resistance of ovarian and breast
cancer cells to the chemotherapy drug, cis-platinum. Finally,
using miRNA microarray, we found that decreased let-7i
expression was significantly associated with the shorter
progression-free survival of patients with late-stage ovarian
cancer (n = 72, P = 0.042). This finding was further validated in
the same sample set by stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR (n = 62, P = 0.001) and in an independent sample set by
in situ hybridization (n = 53, P = 0.049). Taken together, our
results strongly suggest that let-7i might be used as a therapeutic
target to modulate platinum-based chemotherapy and as a
biomarker to predict chemotherapy response and survival in
patients with ovarian cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10307–14]

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most frequent cause of
gynecologic malignancy-related mortality in women (1). Although
advances in platinum-based chemotherapy have resulted in

improved survival, patients typically experience disease relapse
within 2 years of initial treatment and develop platinum resistance
(2). Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms that
underlie platinum resistance, including the discovery of robust
predictive biomarkers which monitor the treatment and development of combination therapy that uses platinum with resistance
modulators or new molecularly targeted drugs, should allow
optimized therapy, such that substantial improvements in the
outlook for women with this disease can be achieved (2, 3).
Nevertheless, studies in the identification of druggable targets and
biomarkers for ovarian cancer have thus far mainly focused on the
role of protein-coding genes, whereas our knowledge of functional
noncoding genomic sequences, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), is
still in its infancy. miRNAs are f22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs,
which negatively regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific
manner (4–6). The potential regulatory circuitry afforded by
miRNA is enormous (4). Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs
are key regulators of various fundamental biological processes (4).
In EOC, we have generated evidence that miRNA exhibits highfrequency genomic alterations (7), and that its expression is
remarkably deregulated (8), strongly suggesting that miRNA is
involved in the initiation and progression of this disease. Indeed,
recent studies have shown that miRNAs play a critical role in tumor
cells by serving as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes
(5, 6), as well as by offering resistance to cytotoxic anticancer
therapy (9–11). The current rapid advances in oligonucleotide/
nanoparticle therapy create realistic optimism for the establishment of miRNAs as a new and potent therapeutic target and/or
chemoresistant modulator in cancer treatment.
Let-7 is among the founding and best understood miRNAs in the
Caenorhabditis elegans genome. It times seam cell terminal
differentiation, possibly by acting as a regulator of multiple genes
required for cell cycle and proliferation (12–15). In other organisms
such as mouse, rat, and human, the let-7 family is composed of
multiple members with overlapping or distinct functions (16).
Eleven members of let-7 have been identified in the human genome
(16). Most importantly, the let-7 family is one of the first reported
tumor suppressor miRNAs in cancer, which negatively regulates the
RAS and is expressed at lower levels in lung tumors than in normal
lung tissue (17, 18). Reduced expression of let-7 has also been
associated with shortened postoperative survival in human cancer
patients (18–21). In addition, forced expression of let-7 family
members is able to suppress cancer cell growth both in vitro
(22–24) and in vivo (25, 26). Finally, increasing evidence indicates

that the let-7 family negatively regulates numerous well-characterized oncogenic proteins, such as RAS (17, 25, 27), HMGA2 (23, 24,
27, 28), c-Myc (29), CDC25A (22), CDK6 (22), and cyclin D2 (22).
Although the let-7 family has been generally shown to be a tumor
suppressor gene, there have been contradictory reports that it can
serve an oncogenic function. For example, Brueckner and
colleagues reported that let-7a-3 hypomethylation results in
enhanced tumor phenotype in colon cancer (30).
In the present investigation of miRNA signatures of human EOC
by microarray, we found that let-7i is significantly reduced in
chemotherapy-resistant patients and lower let-7i expression is
strongly associated with shorter progression-free survival of the
patients. In vitro study using various ovarian and breast cancer cell
lines further confirmed that let-7i is involved in the cancer cell
response to cis-platinum. Therefore, our results strongly suggest
that let-7i might be used as a therapeutic target to modulate
platinum-based chemotherapy and as a biomarker to predict
chemotherapy response and survival in ovarian cancer patients.

Materials and Methods
Patients and specimens. All frozen ovarian cancer specimens used in
this study were collected at the University of Turin, Turin, Italy. Clinical
characteristics were as previously defined (7, 8) and listed in Table 1.
Optimal surgical debulking was V1 cm of residual individual tumor nodules.
Front-line chemotherapy comprised platinum, platinum-cyclophosphamide, or (after 1995) platinum-paclitaxel. Complete response to therapy
was defined by normalization of physical examination, abdomino-pelvic
computerized tomography (CT) scan and serum CA-125. Noncomplete
response included partial response (z50% decrease in the sum of greater
tumor dimensions by CT) and no response (<50% decrease or any increase
in tumor). Progression-free survival was the time between completion of
chemotherapy and first recurrence (if a complete response had been
achieved) or progression of disease, defined as z50% tumor increase by CT
scan or two increasing CA-125 values. All tumors were from primary sites,
and were immediately snap-frozen and stored at 80jC. Tissues were
obtained after patients’ written consent under a general tissue collection
protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
Pennsylvania and the University of Turin.
Cell lines and cell culture. Ovarian (SKOV3, 2008, OVCAR10, OVCAR3),
cervical (HeLa), and breast (MCF7, MDA-MB-468) cancer cell lines were
cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% antibiotics (Invitrogen).
RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from 100 to 500 mg of frozen
tissue or 1  106 cultured cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The quality
and quantity of the isolated RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100
system (Agilent).
miRNA microarray. miRNA microarray was performed as previously
described (8). Briefly, 5 Ag of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using biotin
end-labeled random-octamer oligonucleotide primer. Hybridization of
biotin-labeled complementary DNA was performed on the Ohio State
University miRNA microarray chip (OSU_CCC version 3.0), which contains
1,100 miRNA probes, including 326 human miRNA genes, spotted in
duplicates. Often, more than one probe exists for a given mature miRNA.
Additionally, there are quadruplicate probes corresponding to most premiRNAs. The hybridized chips were washed and processed to detect biotincontaining transcripts by streptavidin-Alexa 647 conjugate and scanned on
an Axon 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments).
Microarray analysis. The normalized microarray data were managed
and analyzed by GeneSpring (Agilent), GenePattern,10 BRB-ArrayTools
version 3.6,11 and microarray software suite 4 (TM4).12 Java Treeview 1.0

Stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR (TaqMan miRNA
assay). Expression of mature miRNAs was analyzed by TaqMan miRNA
Assay (Applied Biosystems) under conditions defined by the supplier.
Briefly, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5.5 ng of total RNA in a
15 AL reaction volume using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription
kit (Applied Biosystems). The reactions were first incubated at 16jC for
30 min, then at 42jC for 30 min. The reactions were inactivated by
incubation at 85jC for 5 min. Each cDNA generated was amplified by
quantitative PCR using sequence-specific primers from the TaqMan
MicroRNA Assays Human Panel on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems). The 20 AL PCR included 10 AL of
2 Universal PCR Master Mix (no AmpErase UNG), 2 AL of each 10
TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Mix and 1.5 AL of reverse transcription product.
The reactions were incubated in a 384-well plate at 95jC for 10 min, followed
by 40 cycles at 95jC for 15 s and 60jC for 1 min.
Retroviral transduction and stable cell line generation. The
retrovirus-based human miRNA expression vector was purchased from
GeneService. Retroviral vector containing human let-7i or control vector
was transfected into the packing cell line PT67 (Clontech) using FuGene6
Transfection Reagent (Roche). The medium was changed 48 h posttransfection and the medium containing retrovirus was collected 48 h later.
Human tumor cells were infected with retrovirus in the presence of 8 Ag/mL
of of polybrene.
Transfection of inhibitor oligos. miRIDIAN inhibitors and negative
controls were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were seeded in a 96-well or

24-well plate in antibiotic-free medium to reach a 40% to 50% confluence
the next day. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced prior to
transfection. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000
transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the
manufacturer. For 24-well plates, the concentration used for inhibitors
was 80 nmol/L, and for 96-well plates, the concentration used for inhibitors
was 66 nmol/L. Cells were incubated in the medium containing the
transfection mixture for 72 h until RNA extraction ( from 24-well plate) or
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
(in 96-well plates) was performed.
Cis-platinum treatment. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate in
antibiotic-free medium. cis-Diamineplatinum(II) dichloride (Sigma) or
mock Dulbecco’s PBS alone was added into the medium at various
concentrations. The MTT assay was performed 72 h post-drug addition.
MTT assay. MTT assay was performed in a 96-well plate using the Cell
Proliferation Kit (I) (Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Four
to six wells were done for each sample and experiments were repeated
twice. The resulting colored solution was quantified using an Emax
precision microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 570 nm with a reference
wavelength of 650 nm.
Tissue microarray. The tissue microarray was constructed as described
previously (8). In brief, tumors were embedded in paraffin and 5-Am
sections were stained with H&E to select representative regions for biopsies.
Four core tissue biopsies were obtained from each specimen. The presence
of tumor tissue on the arrayed samples was verified on H&E-stained
sections. The patient material consisted of 53 primary ovarian carcinomas
with serous histology only. The patients were treated at the Helsinki
University Central Hospital between 2000 and 2004. Patients who became
disease-free after the primary treatment (surgery and platinum-taxane–
based chemotherapy) were included in the study, and disease-free survival
was the time from diagnosis to relapse of the disease.
miRNA in situ hybridization and image analysis. In situ detection of
miRNA expression was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tissue microarray sections. Slides were deparaffinized in xylene series and
rehydrated through an ethanol series (100% to 25%). After proteinase K
digestion (30 Ag/mL; Roche) for 10 min and postfixation in 4%
paraformaldehyde, slides were prehybridized in hybridization solution
(50% formamide, 5 SSC, 500 Ag/mL yeast tRNA, 1 Denhardt’s solution)
for 1 h and hybridized overnight with digoxigenin-labeled miRNA-locked
nucleic acid probe (Exiqon) in hybridization solution. After stringent
washes (50% formamide, 2 SSC) at hybridization temperature, chromogenic detection of signals was performed using anti-digoxigenin antibody
(Roche, 1:400 dilution) and PowerVision+ Poly-HRP IHC detection kit
(ImmunoVision Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Occasionally, a nuclear signal was seen most likely representing
nonspecific staining as it was also seen in the negative controls. Therefore,
only cytoplasmic staining (mature miRNA) of the tumor cells was
recorded and classified as positive or negative without knowledge of the
patient outcome.
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization. BAC clones included in the ‘‘1 Mb array’’ platform were recently described (7). Briefly, 4,134
clones from the CalTech A/B and RPCI-11 libraries were collected from both
commercial and private sources and were mapped to build 34 of the human
genomes using either an STS-marker (29%), end sequences (68%), or full
sequences (3%). A minimum of two replicates per clone were printed on
each slide. One microgram of tumor and reference DNA was labeled with
Cy3 or Cy5, respectively (Amersham) using the BioPrime random-primed
labeling kit (Invitrogen). In parallel experiments, tumor DNA and reference
DNA were labeled with the opposite dye to account for differences in dye
incorporation and to provide additional data for analysis. A systematic
protocol was used to analyze array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data for copy number alterations. For quality control purposes,
clones demonstrating an adjusted foreground-to-background intensity ratio
of <0.8 in the reference channel were removed. With dye swap data merged
as input, copy number breakpoints were estimated for each sample by the
Circular Binary segmentation algorithm using breakpoint significance
based on 10,000 permutations. Additional analyses and visualization of

aCGH data were done using the CGHAnalyzer software suite described
previously.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS
statistics software package (SPSS). All results were expressed as mean F SD,
and P < 0.05 was used for significance. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to
estimate 5-year survival rates and were compared with the use of log rank
statistics.

Results
Let-7i expression is significantly reduced in patients with
chemotherapy-resistant EOC. To identify miRNA expression
signatures associated with resistance to chemotherapy in patients
with EOC, specimens from 72 late-stage (stage III and IV) patients
were initially analyzed by miRNA microarray. A total of 69 patients
with well-documented chemotherapy response information were
included for further biomarker identification, and all (n = 72) were
used for survival analysis. The clinical characteristics of those
patients are listed in Table 1. First, differences in miRNA expression
between the complete response (n = 42) and noncomplete response
groups (n = 27, including partial response and no response) were
analyzed. It was found that 34 miRNAs were statistically different
(P < 0.05) between the groups, with 24 (70.6%) miRNAs higher in
the noncomplete response group and 10 miRNAs (29.4%) higher in
the complete response group (Supplementary Table S1). Importantly, nine miRNAs exhibited even greater statistical significance
(P < 0.015) and of those, six were higher in the noncomplete
response group and three were higher in the complete response
group (Fig. 1A and B). In particular, let-7i, a tumor suppressor
miRNA (17, 18), was the top differential miRNA between the two
groups and expressed at remarkably lower levels in the noncomplete response group (expression ratio of complete response
group to noncomplete response group = 9.3, P = 0.003, n = 69;
Fig. 1A). To further validate this finding, we examined let-7i
expression in 62 randomly selected late-stage EOC specimens by
stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Consistent with the
microarray data, let-7i expression was indeed significantly reduced
in the noncomplete response patients (9.1 F 1.5 relative expression
unit; let-7i/U6; n = 25) as compared with their counterparts with
complete response (4.3 F 0.7 relative expression unit; let-7i/U6;
n = 37, P = 0.015; Fig. 1C). In addition, this result was further
confirmed in EpCAM-positive tumor cells isolated from the ascites
of late-stage ovarian cancer patients (f13.9-fold higher in enriched
tumor cells from the complete chemotherapy response patients
compared with those from the noncomplete chemotherapy
patients; n = 8).13 Taken together, we found that there was a
distinguishable miRNA expression signature between the chemotherapy-responsive and chemotherapy-resistant EOC patients, and
expression of the tumor suppressor miRNA let-7i was significantly
reduced in the chemotherapy-resistant EOC patients.
Decreased let-7i expression increases the chemotherapy
resistance of EOC cells. Studies from our group and other groups
have demarcated that miRNAs are globally down-regulated in
human cancers including EOC (8, 31). Those down-regulated
miRNAs, such as the let-7 family (17, 18), might serve as tumor
suppressor genes and their suppression can have an important
effect on tumor cells, e.g., by rendering them more resistant to
cytotoxic anticancer therapy (9–11). let-7i has been reported to be

down-regulated in recurrent ovarian tumors compared with
primary tumors (32). Therefore, to further investigate whether
the above identified miRNAs are functionally involved in tumor
resistance to chemotherapy, three miRNAs (let-7i, mir-321, and mir509; Fig. 1A) that were significantly repressed in the chemotherapyresistant tumors were focused on. mir-321, a fragment of Arg-tRNA,
was excluded from our study, and both mature forms of mir-509
(mir-509-5p and mir-509-3p) were included. A total of three mature
miRNAs, let-7i, mir-509-5p, and mir-509-3p were examined in EOC
cell lines (2008 and SKOV3) in vitro . Endogenous miRNA
expression was blocked by specific antisense oligonucleotide
inhibitors. The effect on miRNA expression by the inhibitor was
confirmed by stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR. More
than 90% of the endogenous miRNA expression was blocked by the
inhibitor 48 hours posttransfection (Fig. 2). It was found that
knockdown of the let-7i expression, but not that of mir-509-3p or
mir-509-5p, significantly increased cell resistance to cis-platinum
treatment in various EOC cell lines (2008, P = 0.004; SKOV3,
P = 0.006; Fig. 2A). A similar result was also found in short-term
primary cultured ovarian tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). To
complement this loss-of-function study, we also stably enforced let7i expression in EOC (2008 and SKOV3) and breast (MCF7) cell
lines via retroviral transduction before exposing them to serial
concentrations of cis-platinum. Overexpression of let-7i in each of
the above cell lines was confirmed by stem-loop real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the loss-of-function
study, overexpression of let-7i significantly increased the chemotherapy response sensitivity in vitro (Fig. 2C). Taken together,
down-regulated or intrinsically reduced let-7i expression could
render EOC cells more resistant to the cis-platinum treatment.
Therefore, let-7i might serve as an important chemotherapy
response modulator in cancer cells.
let-7i DNA copy number does not exhibit genomic alteration
in human cancer. The molecular mechanism of let-7i downregulation in patients with chemotherapy-resistant EOC is unclear.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

Our previous studies indicated that DNA copy number of miRNAs
is highly altered in human cancer including EOC (7), and DNA copy
number alteration significantly contributes to miRNA expression in
cancer. For example, let-7a3 deletion was found in 31.2% of EOC
specimens (n = 106), which significantly reduced let-7a3 expression
in EOC (7). Therefore, we questioned whether DNA copy alteration
of let-7i contributes to the reduced expression of let-7i in patients
with chemotherapy-resistant EOC. In the 69 patients that were
used for initial analysis of chemotherapy-associated miRNA
markers, 30 were analyzed by aCGH (complete response patients,
n = 20; and noncomplete response patients, n = 10). We first
analyzed the genomic locus, Chr12_61-62 Mb, which contains the
primary let-7i gene sequence, in these specimens. However, there
was only one patient with a let-7i DNA copy number alteration in
the chemotherapy response group (1/30, 3.3%), no patients with
either deletion or application were found in the chemotherapyresistant group. This indicates that unlike other let-7 family
members, let-7i does not significantly exhibit DNA copy alteration
in EOC. Therefore, DNA copy number alteration might not affect
let-7i reduced expression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant
EOC. For future confirmation of this conclusion, we expanded our
aCGH study to a large collection of specimens with multiple cancer
types including nine different types of human solid tumors
(bladder breast, colon, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancer,
sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and melanoma; n = 1,315; Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table S2; ref. 33). Consistent with the first analysis,
the DNA copy number of let-7i was found in only extremely low
frequency alterations (gained three to five copies in 5% and heterogeneously deleted in 6%, <10% alteration was usually considered as
the background signal of aCGH), which was significantly lower than
other members of the let-7 family (e.g., let-7a-3 and let-7b deleted in
31.2% of EOC; ref. 7). These results suggested that other unknown
mechanisms reduced let-7i expression in the chemotherapyresistant patients, e.g., mutation, miRNA biogenesis pathway (34),
epigenetic, or transcriptional regulation.

Let-7i in Ovarian Cancer

Low let-7i expression is significantly associated with shorter
survival of patients with EOC. It has been reported that the
expression of let-7 family is a strong prognostic marker for human
cancer patients (18–21). In this study, we identified let-7i as an
important predictor for chemotherapy resistance in patients with
EOC. We further investigated whether let-7i could also serve as a
prognostic marker in patients with EOC. To examine the
correlation between let-7i expression and rapid recurrence of the
disease, we first studied the let-7i expression in 72 late-stage EOC
patient samples by miRNA microarray. Kaplan-Meier survival

analysis indicated that low expression of let-7i was significantly
associated with shorter progression-free survival of the patients as
compared with the high let-7i expression group (P = 0.042, n = 72;
Fig. 4A). We then validated this result by a more accurate mature
miRNA quantitative method in the same sample set. Consistently, a
similar result was also observed in the 62 randomly selected EOC
patient samples analyzed by stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR (n = 62, P = 0.001; Fig. 4B). Finally, we analyzed let-7i
expression in an independent sample set using a completely
different methodology—in situ hybridization. Again, we found that

Figure 2. let-7i expression regulates cis-platinum resistance of EOC cells. A, inhibition of let-7i , but not mir-509-3p or mir-509-5p, increased resistance to cis-platinum
treatment in 2008 and SKOV3 cells. B, stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR showed endogenous let-7i was significantly blocked by let-7i inhibitor. C,
overexpression of let-7i by retroviral infection in 2008, SKOV3, and MCF7 cells increased their sensitivity to the cis-platinum treatment. Inset, stem-loop real-time
reverse transcription-PCR showed that let-7i was stably overexpressed in EOC cell lines by retroviral transfection.

lower let-7i expression was significantly associated with shorter
disease-free survival in 53 samples examined by in situ hybridization of tissue array (n = 53, P = 0.049; Fig. 4C). In conclusion, the
above data strongly suggests that the expression level of let-7i could
serve as a novel prognostic and prediction biomarker for the
survival of patients with EOC.

EOC is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in western
countries (1). The role of miRNAs in ovarian cancer has recently
been proposed and investigated (7, 8, 20, 21, 32, 35–37), which
might offer novel strategies for prevention, early detection,
diagnosis, and treatment of this disease. Here, we used miRNA
microarray on 69 ovarian tumor specimens to identify the miRNA
signature associated with chemotherapy response in ovarian
cancer. Let-7i, a let-7 family member, was found to be an important
miRNA, differentiating ovarian cancer patients with complete
response or noncomplete response to chemotherapy. Further

investigation using a variety of cultured cancer cell lines confirmed
that let-7i is as functionally involved in the tumor cells response to
cis-platinum. The present study may therefore provide a novel
prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.
The role of let-7 in cancer was first shown by the Slack group
when they found that the let-7 family negatively regulates let-60/
RAS in C. elegans by binding to the multiple let-7 complementary
sites in its 3¶-untranslated region (17). Moreover, having found that
let-7 expression is lower in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue,
whereas RAS protein is significantly higher in lung tumors, they
proposed let-7 as a tumor suppressor gene (17), which is consistent
with previous clinical observation in lung cancer (18). The
inhibitory function of the let-7 family in cancer has been
corroborated by a number of groups and in various types of
tumors (9–11, 17, 18, 20–23, 25–29, 34, 35, 38). Let-7 probably
performs those functions by targeting various genes. First, let-7
inhibits several well-characterized oncogenic proteins such as
K-RAS (17, 25, 27), H-RAS (17, 25, 27), HMGA2 (23, 24, 27, 28),
c-Myc (29), and NF2 (11). In addition, let-7 may target multiple cell

cycle–associated genes, e.g., CDC25A (22), CDK6 (22), CDK4 (39),
and cyclin A (39), cyclin D1 (39), cyclin D2 (22), and cyclin D3 (39).
Finally, let-7 regulates a panel of oncofetal genes, e.g., IMP-1/CRDBP (40), and Toll-like receptors, e.g., TLR4 (38). Consistent with
other investigators’ reports (17, 23–25, 27, 28), we also found that
overexpression of let-7i was able to remarkably down-regulate
oncogenic proteins such as H-RAS and HMGA2, in EOC cell lines
(data not shown). Up to one-third of human mRNAs seem to be
miRNA targets (41). Each miRNA can target hundreds of transcripts directly or indirectly (42, 43), and more than one miRNA can
converge on a single transcript target (44). Thus, the potential
regulatory circuitry afforded by the let-7 family is enormous. We
would not expect that one or even a few target proteins play a key
role in let-7i’s function of chemotherapy sensitivity. Instead, we
believe that there is a complex molecular network involved in this
function (Fig. 5A), which indicates that restoring let-7i might be a
more efficient strategy compared with only targeting one proteincoding gene to modulate chemotherapy because multiple pathways
will be affected by let-7i–based therapy.
Recently, an interesting role of the let-7 family in self-renewing
progenitor cells has been reported (27, 45). Ibarra and colleagues
found that let-7 is depleted in the mouse mammary epithelial cell
line, comma-Dh, which contains a population of self-renewing
progenitor cells that can reconstitute the mammary gland,
suggesting its role in the regulation of progenitor maintenance
(45). Self-renewing tumor-initiating cells (T-IC) or cancer stem cells
have been identified and implicated to give rise to cancer. By
comparing miRNA expression in self-renewing and differentiated
cells from breast cancer lines and in breast T-IC (BT-IC) and non–
BT-IC from first-degree breast cancers, Yu and colleagues found

that the let-7 family was markedly reduced in BT-IC and increased
with differentiation (27). They also showed that the let-7 family
regulates multiple BT-IC stem cell–like properties and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells by silencing more than one target
including H-RAS and HMGA2 (27). Those findings are particularly
important to our understanding of the role of let-7 family in cancer,
and especially in patient response to chemotherapy, because
chemotherapy selectively enhances the proportionate survival of
BT-IC (27). In addition, those results strongly suggest that let-7–
based targeted therapy might more efficiently differentiate the
chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem cell population (Fig. 5B).
Although the let-7 family has been generally shown as a tumor
suppressor gene, there have been contradictory reports that certain
members of the let-7 family could also serve an oncogenic function.
For example, let-7a-3 has been reported to be located in a CpG locus
by two groups (21, 30), and we also reported that the chromosome
region harboring this miRNA is highly deleted in EOC (7). However,
Lu and colleagues reported that hypermethylation of let-7a-3 in
EOC is associated with a favorable prognosis (21), whereas
Brueckner and colleagues made the opposite discovery that its
hypomethylation results in enhanced tumor phenotype in cultured
HCT 116 colon cancer cells (30). Those results indicated that the
highly homologous let-7 family members may play contradicting
functions in different cancer types or cellular context. Most recently,
Vasudevan and colleagues documented that let-7 induces translation up-regulation of target mRNAs on cell cycle arrest, yet it
represses translation in proliferating cells (46). Therefore, the
function of let-7 family in cancer might be more complex than we
previously expected before. Further studies are needed on the
function of individual let-7 family members in human cancer.

Cancer Research

miRNAs provide a therapeutic target for cancer treatment (5).
Modified antisense oligonucleotides complementary to miRNAs are
used by many groups to inhibit miRNAs with oncogenic properties.
To supplement and/or enhance the function of tumor suppressor
miRNAs, enforced expression of a short hairpin RNA from a
polymerase II or III promoter in a nonviral or viral vector,
which can be further processed into mature miRNAs, has been
tested (47–50). In addition, in vivo delivery of double-stranded
miRNA mimics has been reported (47–50). The current rapid
advances in oligonucleotide/nanoparticle therapy create realistic
optimism for the establishment of the let-7 family as a new and
potent therapeutic target and/or chemoresistant modulator in
cancer treatment.
