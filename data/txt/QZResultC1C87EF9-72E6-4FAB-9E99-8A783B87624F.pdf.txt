Abstract
The management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) is extremely poor due to lack of an efﬁcient therapy
and development of chemoresistance to the current standard
therapy, gemcitabine. Recent studies implicate the intimate
reciprocal interactions between epithelia and underlying stroma due to paracrine Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling in producing desmoplasia and chemoresistance in PDAC. Herein, we
report for the ﬁrst time that a nonsteroidal drug, ormeloxifene,
has potent anticancer properties and depletes tumor-associated
stromal tissue by inhibiting the SHH signaling pathway in
PDAC. We found that ormeloxifene inhibited cell proliferation
and induced death in PDAC cells, which provoked us to
investigate the combinatorial effects of ormeloxifene with
gemcitabine at the molecular level. Ormeloxifene caused
potent inhibition of the SHH signaling pathway via downregulation of SHH and its related important downstream tar-

gets such as Gli-1, SMO, PTCH1/2, NF-kB, p-AKT, and cyclin
D1. Ormeloxifene potentiated the antitumorigenic effect of
gemcitabine by 75% in PDAC xenograft mice. Furthermore,
ormeloxifene depleted tumor-associated stroma in xenograft
tumor tissues by inhibiting the SHH cellular signaling pathway
and mouse/human collagen I expression. Xenograft tumors
treated with ormeloxifene in combination with gemcitabine
restored the tumor-suppressor miR-132 and inhibited stromal
cell inﬁltration into the tumor tissues. In addition, invasiveness
of tumor cells cocultivated with TGFb-stimulated human pancreatic stromal cells was effectively inhibited by ormeloxifene
treatment alone or in combination with gemcitabine. We
propose that ormeloxifene has high therapeutic index and in
a combination therapy with gemcitabine, it possesses great
promise as a treatment of choice for PDAC/pancreatic cancer.

Introduction

However, safety proﬁle of these drugs is less favorable than
gemcitabine therapy, accounting for myelosuppression and
peripheral neuropathy (2–4). Despite these advances, the overall
outcome remains miserable for this patient population. Thus,
investigations on alternative approaches for PDAC therapy are a
high research priority.
Activation of oncogenes, such as Kras, and/or inactivating
mutations or loss of expression of tumor-suppressor genes
(including DPC4, p16, p53, and SMAD4) is known in PDAC
(5). It has been shown that extensive desmoplasia is one of the
underlying causes of pancreatic cancer's poor prognosis and
chemoresistance (6). Desmoplasia is typically characterized by
excessive production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and collagen I
and is associated with proliferation of stromal cells, myoﬁbroblasts, and pancreatic stellate cells. A profound role of Sonic
hedgehog (SHH) pathway is implicated in desmoplasia (7) and
cancer progression (8), including PDAC (9). This developmental
pathway, dormant in the adult pancreas, becomes reactivated
early in PDAC development (10). SHH is a member of the
Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins, having
diverse functions during vertebrate development (11). In pancreatic tumors, intimate reciprocal interactions occur between epithelia and underlying stroma due to paracrine Hh signaling that
lead to desmoplasia and form a barrier to chemotherapy drug(s)
penetration (12). Depletion of tumor stroma leads to the increasing functional vasculature that provides a feasible avenue for
efﬁcient therapeutic drug delivery (13). In addition, Hh signaling

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis largely due to its propensity for early local invasion, distant
metastasis, and lack of effective therapies. Many chemotherapeutic regimens have failed and the current standard-of-care therapy,
gemcitabine, extends patient survival by only a few months (1).
Newer treatment options for PDAC patients are FOLFIRINOX and
nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine, which improved overall survival by
4.3 and 1.8 months over gemcitabine therapy, respectively (2, 3).

Ormeloxifene Suppresses Desmoplasia in Pancreatic Cancer

plays a key role in the maintenance of pancreatic cancer stem cells
(CSC) that are involved in drug resistance, cancer recurrence, and
poor clinical outcome (10). Therefore, molecular and/or chemical
intervention to target Hh signaling and disruption in the microenvironment in tumors could be an interesting therapeutic
approach for pancreatic cancer (13). Some of the well-known
Hh signaling antagonists, such as vismodegib (GDC-0449), have
been investigated alone or as an adjuvant to the traditional
anticancer drugs but have not yielded clinically meaningful results
(14, 15) and have shown notable adverse effects including teratogenic properties (16, 17). Thus, identiﬁcation of novel therapies
with high therapeutic index that can target Hh and tumor progression signaling pathways with no or minimal adverse effects is
required.
Repurposing of established drugs as anticancer agents is a
current active investigative approach. Ormeloxifene is a nonhormonal, nonsteroidal oral contraceptive molecule (18).
Recent studies suggested that ormeloxifene may be effective in
inhibiting breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and chronic
myeloid leukemia cells (18). Moreover, ormeloxifene is
reported to have an excellent therapeutic index and is safe for
chronic administration (19). This study demonstrates the
inhibitory role of ormeloxifene on the SHH signaling pathway,
and describes inhibitory patterns of this drug on pancreatic
tumor progression using bidirectional tumor stromal interactions. This inhibitory effect was either more pronounced or
comparable with a known smoothened (SMO) inhibitor, GDC0449, in PDAC cells. Ormeloxifene disrupts the stroma of
ﬁbrotic pancreatic tumors and inhibits the proliferating stellate
and myeloid cells involved in the development of pancreatic
ﬁbrosis. Furthermore, the combinatorial effects of ormeloxifene with gemcitabine induce increased gemcitabine sensitivity.
In addition, these studies also suggest wide use of ormeloxifene
in PDAC patients due to its intended safe use in fertile women,
considering the teratogenic potential of other Hh pathway
inhibitors such as cyclopamine and GDC-0449 (20, 21).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, growth conditions, and treatments
Cell lines were purchased from the ATCC and were maintained
at 37 C/5% CO2 in recommended growth medium with 10% FBS
(RPMI, DMEM and DMEM/Ham's F12; Hyclone Laboratories).
Human CSCs (CD133þ/CD44þ/CD24þ/ESAþ) were obtained
from Celprogen Inc. They were isolated from primary tumors and
have been described previously (22). All cell lines were maintained
in continuous exponential growth by twice a week passaging in
cell type-speciﬁc media. Ormeloxifene was generously synthesized
and provided by Fathi Halaweish (South Dakota State University,
Brookings, SD) as described earlier (23). Gemcitabine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (cat. no. G6423) and GDC-0449 from
Sellekchem (cat. no. S1082). Cells were treated with indicated
doses of ormeloxifene, gemcitabine, and GDC-0449 after completely solubilized in ethanol, PBS, and DMSO, respectively.
Cell proliferation by MTS assay
The antiproliferative effect of ormeloxifene was determined after
48 hours using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One solution assay (cat.
no. G5421; Promega) using a microplate reader (BioMate 3 UV-Vis
spectrophotometer; Thermo Electron Corporation). Ethanol- or
PBS-containing medium served as the vehicle control. In addition,

www.aacrjournals.org

the antiproliferative effect of ormeloxifene was determined at 24
and 48 hours using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Mayﬂower Bioscience)
and the percentage viability of Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells was determined after treatment with GDC-0449 and ormeloxifene. The
antiproliferative effect of each treatment was calculated as a percentage of cell growth with respect to the vehicle control.
Cell proliferation by xCELLigence assay
PDAC cells (10,000 cells/well) were seeded in E-plate (Roche)
following the xCELLigence Real Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) DP
instrument manual as provided by the manufacturer (Roche;
ref. 24). After 24 hours, ormeloxifene or the vehicle control was
added and the experiment was allowed to run for 100 hours.
Average baseline cell index for ormeloxifene-treated cells compared with control cells was calculated for at least two measurements from three replicated experiments.
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and necrosis
BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells (1  106) were treated for 24 hours
with ormeloxifene (15 mmol/L) and gemcitabine (100 nmol/L)
alone and in combination. Cells were stained with Annexin V–
FITC and propidium iodide (PI). The apoptotic and necrotic
populations were detected as described earlier (25). Cells were
scanned in FL-1 (FITC) versus FL-2 (PI) channels and analyzed
using an Accuri C6 ﬂow cytometer (Accuri Cytometers, Inc.).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were exposed to ormeloxifene (15 mmol/L) and gemcitabine (100 nmol/L) alone or in combination for 24 hours
and stained with Telford Reagent containing PI (cat. no. P-4170;
Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were analyzed with an Accuri C6 ﬂow cytometer. Cells with hypodiploid DNA (content less than G0–G1) were
deemed apoptotic (sub-G0–G1).
Dual-Luciferase reporter assay
Dual-Luciferase reporter assay was carried out to investigate the
effect of treatments on Gli-1 and NF-kB transcriptional activity
using a luciferase assay kit (cat. no. E2940; Promega) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs [NF-kB, gift from Dr.
Ajay Singh, Mitchell Cancer Institute, Fairhope, AL, Cignal GLI
Reporter (luc) Kit, cat. no. CCS-6030L; Qiagen] and treated with
ormeloxifene and gemcitabine alone or in combination for 24
hours. The normalized luciferase activity was expressed as a ratio
of ﬁreﬂy luciferase to Renilla luciferase units.
Indirect coculture of PDAC cells and pancreatic stromal cells
Human pancreatic stromal cell (PSC) ﬁbroblasts and stellate
cells were attained from an islet transplant program and maintained in CMRL-1066 medium (cat. no. 15110; Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin sodium, and streptomycin
sulfate at 37 C in humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Human PSCs (3  106 cells/culture insert) were seeded into the
culture inserts of 1.0-mm pore size (BD Biosciences) in CMRL1066 media. On day 2, the culture inserts were placed into 6-well
plates containing Panc-1 cells (0.8  106 cells/well), followed by
treatment with ormeloxifene (10 mmol/L) and gemcitabine (100
nmol/L) and incubated up to 2 days in DMEM medium. As
previous studies have shown TGFb to be a potent inducer of
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in several cancer cells
including pancreatic cancer cells (26, 27), we used recombinant

TGFb (2 ng/mL) to stimulate the stromal cells as a mediator of
PSC-induced EMT in cells.
Clonogenic assay
For the clonogenic assay, 500 cells were treated with indicated
concentrations of ormeloxifene for 12 days. The visible colonies
( 50 cells) were counted following hematoxylin staining (Fisher
Scientiﬁc) and the percentage of colonies was calculated as compared with control, as described earlier (28).
Cell motility, migration, and invasion assays
Cell motility was analyzed with a Boyden's chamber assay (28).
For cell invasion assays, BD Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers
(BD Biosciences) were used as per the manufacturer's instructions.
After 48 hours of incubation, the invading cells were stained and
counted in 10 ﬁelds of view. In addition, a wound-healing
migration assay was also used to evaluate the effect of ormeloxifene on the migratory ability of cancer cells. The cell monolayer
was scraped using a micropipette tip and 48 to 72 hours after
treatment, the residual gap length was calculated from photomicrographs. To further conﬁrm these ﬁndings, real-time migration and proliferation were performed by the xCELLigence system,
which is an electrical impedance-based method that allows for the
measurement of cell migration and proliferation in real-time
(24). Brieﬂy, 4  104 cells were seeded per chamber of cell
invasion and migration (CIM) plate and the cells were analyzed
in xCELLigence instrument at 37 C, 5% CO2 for migration and
invasion assays.
Immunoblot analysis
Human PDAC cells (1  106) were treated with ormeloxifene
(15 mmol/L) and gemcitabine (100 nmol/L) alone and in combination for 24 hours. Total cell lysates were prepared followed
by immunoblotting for various indicated proteins as described
earlier (25).
Reverse transcription–quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (cat. no. AM
9738; Invitrogen) and integrity was checked with an RNA 6000
Nano Assay kit and 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The
mRNA expression levels were determined by quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) using TaqMan PCR master mixture and
TaqMan-speciﬁc probes (Applied Biosystems). The expression of
genes was normalized to the 18S rRNA gene.

were injected with BxPC-3 cells intraperitoneally (i.p.; 3  106)
and (5  106) cells in 200 mL PBS/Matrigel subcutaneously. On
day 15, the mice were treated with vehicle (ethanol), ormeloxifene
(200 mg), gemcitabine (500 mg), or their combination via i.p.
injections, three times a week, for 6 subsequent weeks. Mice were
weighed twice a week to monitor their health and tumor growth.
Tumor volume (V) was estimated from the length (l), width (w),
and height (h) of the tumor using the formula V ¼ 1/4 0.52 (l  w 
h), as described previously (Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 28). Fortyﬁve days after the ﬁrst drug injection, mice were euthanized and
tumor burden (wet weight) and metastases were noted. The
organs, including pancreas, were harvested and checked for
metastases. The data were modeled with time (discrete), group
(control, ormeloxifene, gemcitabine, and ORMþGEM), and the
interaction between them. Primary analyses involved planned
comparisons (separately for each time point) between control
and ormeloxifene/gemcitabine versus ORMþGEM. Animal care
was performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and
all animal experiments were carried out using protocols approved by the Sanford Research Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
In situ hybridization for microRNA detection and expression
We detected the expression of miR-132 in formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissues of control and treated xenograft
mice. We used an in situ hybridization technique and used a
Biochain kit (cat. no. K2191050; Biochain IsHyb In Situ hybridization kit) as previously described (29). Brieﬂy, tissues were
hybridized with hybridization buffer and digoxigenin-labeled
probe (EXIQON) at 45 C overnight followed by incubation with
the AP-conjugated anti-digoxingenin antibody and NBT/BCIP
(Pierce) and nuclear fast red counterstaining.
Immunoﬂuorescence and immunohistochemical analyses
Immunoﬂuorescence and IHC analyses were used to analyze
the untreated and treated xenograft tumor tissues to detect
changes associated with the expression of important proteins
involved in tumor–stromal interactions as described previously
(30). The slides were stained with speciﬁc antibodies following
heat-induced antigen retrieval techniques and imaged using a
laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon TIRF) with a 200
Apochromat objective for immunoﬂuorescence. For immunohistochemistry, the slides were stained using Biocare's MACH4
Universal HRP-Polymer kit (Biocare Medical) and analyzed as
previously described (29, 30).

Tumorsphere assay
Pancreatic CSCs were plated on ultra-low attachment plates
(Corning) at a density of 1  103/100 mL well/96-well plate and
treated with ormeloxifene or GDC-0449 (2.5–10 mmol/L). The
plates were allowed to grow for 7 days in 0.5% serum-free
medium (Cellprogen) to form primary spheres. Following the
incubation, the primary spheres were dissociated into single-cell
suspension and plated at a density of 1  104/2 mL/6-well ultralow attachment plate. Secondary spheres were counted after 7 to
10 days in culture.

Statistical analyses
Statistical signiﬁcance of the studies was analyzed by the
Student t test. Differences with P values of < 0.05 are considered
signiﬁcant. Tumor size values were examined at the day 50 point,
using an ANOVA approach. Tests of main effects (differences
between treatments) and contrasts were performed.

duration of 100 hours using the xCELLigence system (Fig. 1B).
This assay monitors cell growth in real time by measuring changes
in electric impedance between two golden electrodes embedded
in the bottom of the cell culture wells. The impedance, which is
converted to a cell index value, is directly proportional to the
number of cells and also reﬂects the cells' viability, morphology,
and adhesion strength (31). The growth curve, which is presented
as a baseline cell index, showed that ormeloxifene signiﬁcantly
reduced the baseline cell index compared with the control cells
(Fig. 1B). Furthermore, ormeloxifene treatment inhibited the
clonogenic potential of PDAC cells (BxPC-3, Panc-1, AsPC-1,
MiaPaca, and HPAF-II) as evident by the decreased number of
colonies after ormeloxifene treatment (Fig. 1C). Moreover, ormeloxifene was also found to inhibit cellular motility (Fig. 2A) and
invasion (Fig. 2B) of PDAC cells. The inhibition of the migratory
ability of cells is demonstrated by wound-healing assay (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and cellular invasion by Matrigel invasion assay
(Supplementary Fig. S1C), which was further conﬁrmed using the
xCELLigence method (Fig. 2C).
In addition, we sought to compare the anticancer potential of
ormeloxifene with a known SMO inhibitor (GDC-0449) in
human PDAC cells. Ormeloxifene showed more pronounced or
comparable inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, clonogenicity,

www.aacrjournals.org

and invasion than GDC-0449 at equal indicated concentrations
(Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). Inhibition of cell viability and
invasion was observed within 48 hours following exposure to
these drugs.
Ormeloxifene treatment inhibits tumorsphere formation in
pancreatic stem cells
We observed a signiﬁcant effect of ormeloxifene on tumorsphere formation in CSCs as reﬂected by a reduction in size and
number of tumorspheres in cells upon treatment, suggesting the
clonogenic depletion of the CSCs. In contrast, GDC-0449 did not
show a signiﬁcant effect on secondary tumorsphere formation
(Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Ormeloxifene inhibits SHH signaling in PDAC cells
The SHH signaling pathway has been implicated in the development of pancreatic cancer (9). Therefore, PDAC cells were
treated with ormeloxifene and changes in the SHH signaling
pathway were evaluated by Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses.
Ormeloxifene treatment effectively inhibited SHH expression at
protein and mRNA levels at indicated concentrations (Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Ormeloxifene treatment also
inhibited the expression of Gli-1, SMO, cyclin D1, and p-AKT, the

with Gli-1 proteins to repress SHH signaling (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S3A; ref. 32).
Importantly, ormeloxifene treatment caused a marked (70%)

Ormeloxifene and gemcitabine in combination induce

We investigated whether ormeloxifene treatment enhanced the
apoptotic index in gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cells (Panc-1 and
BxPC-3). Our data show that when combined, ormeloxifene (15
mmol/L), and gemcitabine (100 nmol/L) induced a signiﬁcantly
higher (21%) apoptotic population in 24 hours as compared with

indicative of Annexin V–positive apoptotic cells and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. Instead, it may involve death receptor–
mediated extrinsic apoptotic signaling. Therefore, we sought to
investigate the effect of ormeloxifene on cell-cycle phase distribution. Typically, D-type cyclins are required for the progression
of cells from the G1-phase of the cell cycle to S-phase (35).
Ormeloxifene treatment decreased the expression of cyclin D in
BxPC-3 and MiaPaca cells (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Ormeloxifene treatment led to cell-cycle arrest at sub-G0–G1
phase in Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells. Cells in sub-G1-phase increased
up to 74% after ormeloxifene treatment (15 mmol/L), while cells
in the S-phase decreased from 19% to 5%. However, gemcitabine
treatment did not show an additional effect on cell-cycle phases
(Fig. 3B). Similar effects in cell-cycle phase distribution were
observed in BxPC-3 cells, which showed signiﬁcant inhibition of
the G2–M phase upon treatment with ormeloxifene and gemcitabine in combination.
Ormeloxifene and gemcitabine combination targets SHH
signaling pathway and inhibits CIM in PDAC cells
In addition, we investigated combinatorial effects of ormeloxifene and gemcitabine on SHH and downstream signaling molecules. Treatment with ormeloxifene and gemcitabine has relatively more pronounced inhibitory effects on the expression of SHH,
Gli-1, and SMO as compared with ormeloxifene or gemcitabine
alone (Fig. 3D). This reveals the potentiated effects of ormeloxifene in combination with gemcitabine. We also conﬁrmed these
results by qRT-PCR analysis and observed an apparent decrease in
the mRNA levels of main effectors of the SHH signaling pathway
in response to ormeloxifene alone or in combination with gemcitabine. This included decreased expression of SHH (4-fold),
SMO (5-fold), and patched 1/2 (PTCH1/2) compared with the
control (Fig. 3C). Ormeloxifene alone or in combination with
gemcitabine also showed a marked (40%) decrease in the level
of antiapoptotic, Bcl-xL protein (Fig. 3D). The Bcl-xL protein is
also an important mediator of SHH and is transcriptionally
regulated by SHH through the Gli-1 transcription factor (34). In
addition, ormeloxifene alone or in combination with gemcitabine inhibited the Gli-1 and NF-kB-65 transcriptional activity in
PDAC cells (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3C). These results
present ﬁrst evidence that ormeloxifene inhibits the SHH–Gli-1
signaling pathway in PDAC.
Moreover, we evaluated the ability of ormeloxifene and gemcitabine to inhibit tumor progression and found that ormeloxifene inhibited motility (Fig. 4B) and the migratory ability of
PDAC cells as demonstrated by wound healing (Fig. 4C).
Ormeloxifene and gemcitabine combination efﬁciently
abrogates TGFb-induced SHH signaling
The interactions among the stromal and tumor cells and the
various cytokines embedded in the ECM contribute to the neoplastic phenotype (36). In addition to the activated tumor–
stromal myoﬁbroblasts (characterized by the expression of contractile genes such as smooth-muscle actin, aSMA; ref. 37), the
activated PSCs that are characterized by expression of the stellate
cell activation-associated protein (cygb/STAP) are identiﬁed as the
major source of the excessive stromal ECM production in pancreatic tumors (6). Here, we show for the ﬁrst time that indirect
coculture of PDAC cells with PSCs (stimulated with TGFb)
induced enhanced secretion of SHH and chemokine CXCL12
(stromal cell–derived factor-1, SDF1) that was abrogated by

2298 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

ormeloxifene alone or in combination with gemcitabine. Gemcitabine treatment alone did not show any effect as observed
through ELISA of the conditioned media in which the PDAC
cells were cultured (Fig. 4D). CXCL12 is abundantly produced by
the stromal cells that induce SHH expression, which promotes
progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance of PDAC cells (38).
In addition, treatment with ormeloxifene alone or in combination inhibited the proliferation of PSCs as depicted by the
decreased expression of aSMA and cygb/STAP in the immunoﬂuorescence of PSCs (Fig. 4D, bottom). These results suggest that
ormeloxifene not only reduces the number of stromal cells
involved in the development of pancreatic ﬁbrosis but also
inhibits the paracrine SHH signaling between cancer and stromal
cells that leads to desmoplasia and causes chemoresistance.
Combined ormeloxifene and gemcitabine treatment effectively
inhibits tumor burden in mice model
To investigate the anticancer effects of ormeloxifene, we used a
subcutaneous (for solid tumor) and i.p. (metastatic) preclinical
murine xenograft model generated with gemcitabine-resistant
BxPC-3 cells. Both ormeloxifene and gemcitabine, administered
alone, inhibited overall tumor burden, but combination treatment of the two was more efﬁcacious than either of them alone
(Fig. 5A and B). When compared with the control mice, mice
treated with ormeloxifene (P ¼ 0.0301) or gemcitabine (P ¼
0.0009) or ORMþGEM in combination (P < 0.0001) showed a
marked reduction in tumor weight (Fig. 5B). Moreover, in the i.p.
model, tumors barely developed in the ORMþGEM–treated
group. Upon further examination, we also found there were fewer
or no metastases in the mice treated with ormeloxifene alone or in
combination with gemcitabine (Fig. 5B, inset table). miR-132 is
downregulated in pancreatic cancer, which contributes to pancreatic cancer development (39). Treatment of ormeloxifene
alone or in combination with gemcitabine leads to increased
levels of miR-132 in xenograft tumors (Fig. 5C). These data further
conﬁrm that ormeloxifene treatment along with gemcitabine
could be an effective therapeutic modality for pancreatic cancer.
Ormeloxifene inhibits tumor desmoplasia and the host cells
invading the tumor
To elucidate the basis of the potentiated antitumorigenic effects
of ormeloxifene in combination with gemcitabine in mice, we
analyzed the FFPE tumor tissues through tumor histopathology,
immunoﬂuorescence, and IHC analyses. We observed a clear inhibition of Gli-1 expression in tumor tissues from mice treated
with either ormeloxifene alone or in combination with gemcitabine (Fig. 5D). In contrast to vehicle- or gemcitabine-treated mice,
which exhibited profuse desmoplastic tumor stroma, mice treated
with ormeloxifene showed markedly depleted desmoplastic stroma. This was evidenced by a decrease in collagen I content in
tumor xenografts and the invading host mice cells migrating into
the tumors (Fig. 6A). It was found that only ormeloxifene, but not
gemcitabine, reduced the amount of collagen I deposition. Interestingly, these differences were apparent in mice treated with
ormeloxifene or ORMþGEM. In addition, ormeloxifene alone
or in combination with gemcitabine treatment showed decreased
number of activated stromal cell populations as identiﬁed by the
reduced expression of aSMA and ﬁbroblast surface protein (FSP)–
positive stromal myoﬁbroblasts (Fig. 6A) and cygb/STAP positive
activated stellate cells (Fig. 6B; ref. 37). Gemcitabine alone treatment did not show any effects on these parameters. This decrease

in proliferation was accompanied by a decrease in SHH expression in ormeloxifene and ORMþGEM–treated tumor tissues (Fig.
6B). Furthermore, we analyzed these tumor tissues for the presence of tumor-inﬁltrating macrophages and found a large increasing population of macrophages in ormeloxifene-treated mice
tumor tissues (Fig. 6B) that might become tumoricidal and
facilitate the depletion of the tumor stroma (40, 41). This signiﬁes
that ormeloxifene alone or in combination with gemcitabine
inhibits the host cells invading the tumor tissue and disrupts the
desmoplastic stroma that can facilitate the delivery and enhance
the efﬁcacy of gemcitabine.

Discussion
Pancreatic tumors are typically characterized by a high desmoplastic reaction (42). Desmoplasia plays an important role to
initiate cross-talk between stromal-cancer cells, limit the delivery

and effectiveness of chemotherapy, and induce chemoresistance.
The SHH pathway is a major player for desmoplasia and is
activated in both stromal and cancer cells in PDAC (7, 43).
Therefore, suppression of the Hh pathway and desmoplasia may
limit the molecular/clinical course of PDAC and improve drug(s)
access in tumors (13). Currently available Hh pathway antagonists, including GDC-0449, have been investigated as a single
agent or in combination with conventional chemotherapies for
cancer treatment (14, 15). GDC-0449 is an SMO (Hh) inhibitor
approved by the FDA for the treatment of locally advanced and
metastatic basal cell carcinomas. But severe toxicity issues and
adverse effects (fatigue, nausea, asthenia, mucositis, peripheral
sensory neuropathy, dysgeusia, muscle spasms, and dehydration)
and the lack of strong efﬁcacy, limits its use in cancer therapy (44).
In addition, no signiﬁcant improvement in survival of pancreatic,
colon, and ovarian cancer patients is noticed in recent clinical
trials of Hh signaling inhibitors. As other signaling pathways

therapeutic efﬁcacy of SMO inhibitors is compromised in cancer.
This is a probable rationale for shifting interest from SMO
inhibitors toward more speciﬁc Gli inhibitors in order to effectively suppress the Hh signaling pathway. In this endeavor, we
have identiﬁed ormeloxifene, a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene
compound that effectively blocks the Hh signaling pathway by
inhibiting the important effectors of this pathway, such as SHH,
SMO, Gli-1, and SDF-1 (CXCL12). Ormeloxifene disrupts multiple paracrine factors that are important for the maintenance of

Hh signaling, and thus inhibits stromal and tumor cell cross-talk
within the tumor.
Experimental investigations indicate that ormeloxifene inhibits
proliferation, invasion, and clonogenicity of PDAC cells (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Fig. S2), comparable with cells treated with
GDC-0449. In addition, reduced tumorsphere formation of CSCs
that were treated with ormeloxifene indicates that ormeloxifene
also inhibits pancreatic CSC proliferation and self-renewal. This
suggests that the anticancer effects of ormeloxifene are greater or
comparable with GDC-0449. Investigations of the mechanism of
ormeloxifene-induced cell death showed the induction of cell-

cycle arrest at G0–G1 phase, suggesting that ormeloxifene may
induce apoptosis. It was also an intriguing observation that
treatment of ormeloxifene in combination with gemcitabine
showed an increasing population of Annexin V–positive cells as
compared with when both were used alone. These results indicate
that in the presence of ormeloxifene, gemcitabine induces higher
apoptotic cell death that might be triggered through the mitochondrial pathway. Alternatively, the other possibility is that
ormeloxifene might involve death receptor–mediated cell death.

www.aacrjournals.org

Altogether, the results indicated that ormeloxifene potentiates the
anticancer effect of gemcitabine when used in combination.
It has been reported that NF-kB (33) and SHH (7, 43) signaling
pathways play crucial roles in PDAC progression and drug resistance, including gemcitabine. Ormeloxifene treatment stabilizes
IkBa, which inhibits protein and transcriptional activity of NFkB-65, preventing it from binding to the SHH promoter and
leading to its transcription (33). This was further conﬁrmed on
ﬁnding that ormeloxifene alone or in combination with gemcitabine inhibits the main downstream targets of SHH, SMO, and
PTCH1/2 and downregulates the expression and transcriptional
activity of Gli-1 in PDAC cells. No such effects were found in cells
when treated with gemcitabine alone. In the absence of SHH, cells
have small amounts of PTCH1/2 and Gli and therefore, the high
concentrations of these transcripts generally indicate involvement
of the SHH pathway in PDAC (47). The aberrantly activated SHH
binds to its receptor PTCH1/2 and inhibits the suppressive effect
of PTCH1/2 on SMO, which activates Gli-1 to transcribe Hh
oncogenic target genes (43). Ormeloxifene inhibits AKT phosphorylation, which is known to activate Gli-1 (48). The observations collected from coculturing the PDAC cells with stromal cells
indicate the inhibition of paracrine stromal cell signaling through
the inhibition of their proliferation and secretion of SHH and
SDF1. All these results conﬁrm that ormeloxifene inhibits Hh
signaling in PDAC cells; thus, we hypothesized that it might also
disrupt the stroma of pancreatic tumors and alter the desmoplastic reaction.
Recent studies implicate the profound role of stroma in drug
resistance in numerous tumor types (49). Thus, treatment paradigms targeting both neoplastic cells and stromal components are
emerging for PDAC (50). The enhanced antitumor effect of
ormeloxifene and gemcitabine combination treatment was
observed in xenograft mouse models when compared with their
treatment alone. An abundant stromal component was observed
in the control and gemcitabine-treated tumor tissues while mice
treated with ormeloxifene alone or ORMþGEM combination
showed markedly less stromal component and invaded stromal
tissue. This was indicated by the presence of reduced numbers of
stroma myoﬁbroblasts inﬁltrating the tumor tissue, as indicated
by reduced PSCs, aSMA, FSP, and cygb/STAP expression in the
tumor tissue. This might be well supported by the observations
showing the inhibition of both mouse and human collagen I in
tissues, as activated PSCs are the predominant source of collagen
in the desmoplastic reaction in pancreatic cancers (6). Interestingly, we also observed an increased number of macrophages in
the tumors obtained from ormeloxifene-treated mice. The increasing macrophage recruitment to tumor site can be explained as the
emergence of tumor immunity that serves as a part of immune
surveillance for targeting tumor stroma in the treatment of cancer.
The activated macrophages may rapidly inﬁltrate the tumors,
become tumoricidal and facilitate the depletion of tumor stroma.
These ﬁndings suggest that ormeloxifene inhibits desmoplastic
reaction in PDAC. Due to the toxicity and morbidity of available
drugs, there is an urgent need for effective therapies that could
target both tumor and stromal compartments to regulate pancreatic tumor growth. Therefore, ormeloxifene might be a drug of
choice as it is very safe for chronic use in humans. Our results
signify that ormeloxifene is effective in targeting Hh and tumor
progression signaling pathways. Our results emphasize that ormeloxifene interrupts the tumor–stromal interactions to inhibit the
reciprocal relationship between these two components, leading to

reduction of tumor progression, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance (Fig. 7). This facilitates the anticancer effects of
ormeloxifene and potentiates the chemotherapeutic effects of
gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer treatment. Our results have
important implications toward the development of effective
therapy for pancreatic cancer treatment.

Conclusion
In summary, our study provides new evidence regarding the
anticancer effects of ormeloxifene in PDAC. This study demonstrates novel role of an existing drug, ormeloxifene to inhibit
the SHH pathway and desmoplasia, resulting in tumor growth
inhibition and potentiation of the antitumor effect of gemcitabine. This suggests that a combination of ormeloxifene and
gemcitabine may have the capacity to inhibit the SHH signaling
cascade in PDAC cells and alter the behavior of surrounding
stromal cells so that cancer progression is repressed. Therefore,
this study provides evidence that ormeloxifene in combination
with gemcitabine could serve as a novel therapeutic intervention
