BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to examine the clinical significance of ZNF217 amplification and assess
whether ZNF217 could be a potential therapeutic target in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC). METHODS: ZNF217
expression and amplification in OCCC was assessed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and
clinical data collected via a retrospective chart review. ZNF217 gene knockdown using silencing RNA (siRNA) was
used to assess ZNF217 functions in OCCC cell lines. RESULTS: Gene amplification was identified in 12 of 60 (20.0%)
OCCCs. ZNF217 copy number correlated significantly with ZNF217 protein expression (r ¼ 0.341; P<.01). ZNF217 amplification correlated significantly with shorter progression-free (P ¼.0042) and overall (P ¼.0199) survival. There were
nonsignificant trends between high ZNF217 protein expression and poor progression-free (P ¼.2594) and overall
(P ¼.2199) survival. Multivariate analysis revealed ZNF217 gene amplification to be an independent prognostic factor
for progression-free and overall survival after standard platinum agent-based chemotherapy (P ¼.0339 and P ¼.031,
respectively). Profound growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed in ZNF217 siRNA-treated cancer cells with
gene amplification compared with cancer cells with ZNF217 moderate expression without ZNF217 gene amplification
or with low ZNF217 expression. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that ZNF217 overexpression is critical to
growth and survival of OCCCs with ZNF217 gene amplification. Furthermore, they suggest that ZNF217 siRNAinduced phenotypes depend on amplification status of OCCCs. Therefore, ZNF217-targeted therapy may benefit

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in American women1 and is also the most lethal gynecological cancer in Japan. The incidence of OC has increased dramatically in the last decade. Over the last 2 decades,
aggressive cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy have been used in an attempt to improve the survival rate in patients
with OC.2-4 However, the long-term survival rate remains poor as a result of recurrence and the emergence of drug resistance. Based on morphological criteria, there are 4 major types of primary ovarian adenocarcinoma. The chemosensitivity
and biological behaviors also differ among these histological types. Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) comprises more
than 20% of OC cases in Japan, although it only represents 8%-10% of all OC cases in the United States.5,6 Among OCs,
OCCC is one of the most aggressive types, because unlike the more common high-grade serous type, it is refractory to
standard platinum agent-based chemotherapy. Therefore, it is important to establish new treatment strategies to improve
the prognosis of OCCC patients.

ZNF217 Amplification and Poor OCCC Outcome/Rahman et al

Previous morphological and molecular studies have
indicated that OCCC develops in a stepwise fashion from
a common disease progenitor state, endometriosis, and
proceeds through atypical endometriosis to frank malignancy.7-10 Mutations in PIK3CA,11 ARID1A,12 and
genomic amplification of chr20q13.213 are the most common molecular genetic alterations thus far identified in
OCCC.
Gene amplification represents one of the molecular
genetic hallmarks of human cancer. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of how amplified genes initiate and
maintain malignant phenotypes and propel tumor progression is fundamental to understand the molecular
etiology of human cancer and its therapeutic implications.
Our previous genome-wide analysis, a single nucleotide
polymorphism array, identified ZNF217, located at
chr20q13.2, as the most frequently amplified gene in
OCCC.13
20q13.2 amplification and overexpression of
ZNF217 have been described in many human cancers.14,15 Recent evidence indicates that ZNF217 is a
transcriptional repressor16,17 and it may contribute to
neoplastic progression by attenuating apoptotic signals.18,19 In experimental systems, overexpression of
ZNF217 has been shown to immortalize cell lines with
limited life spans, such as human mammary epithelial cell
lines and SV40 Tag-transduced ovarian surface epithelial
cells (IOSE cells). In both of these cell types, ZNF217
expression increased telomerase activity and stabilized
telomere lengths.20,21 ZNF217-transduced IOSE cells
also acquired anchorage independence and reduced serum
dependence.
However, the clinicopathological and prognostic
significance of ZNF217 amplification or expression in
OCCC have not yet been studied. The current study
examined the role of ZNF217 in OCCC by investigating
the relationship between ZNF217 amplification/expression and various clinicopathological variables in OCCC.
We then performed in vitro experiments to discern the
molecular basis of these observations. Finally, we assessed
the use of ZNF217 as a prognostic factor and therapeutic
target in OCCC.

samples we used in this study were pathologically pure
OCCCs. Samples were obtained from the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Shimane University
Hospital and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
at Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital. Diagnosis was
based on conventional morphological examination of sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and tumors
were classified according to the World Health Organization classification. Tumor staging was performed according to the International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) classification. All patients were primarily treated with cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant
platinum agent- and taxane-based or CPT-11 chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC5 with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 or
docetaxel 70 mg/m2, or CPT-11 180 mg/m2 with cisplatin 60 mg/m2). All patients received 6-12 courses of
chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered
to all patients. The treatment included the following:
46.6% received (28/60) paclitaxal and carboplatin combination, 35% (21/60) CPT-11 and cisplatin combination, 18.4% (11/60) docetaxel and carboplatin
combination. Progression was determined according to
the definition of the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup.22
Acquisition of tissue specimens and clinical information
was approved by an institutional review board (Shimane
University and Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital).
Paraffin tissue blocks were organized into tissue microarrays, each made by removing 3-mm cores of tumor tissue
from the block. Selection of the area to core was made by
a gynecologic oncologist (K.N.) and a pathology technician (K.I.) and was based on review of the hematoxylin
and eosin slides.
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
BAC clones (RP5-823G15 and RP4-724E16) containing
the genomic sequences of the 20q13.2 amplicon were purchased from Bacpac Resources (Childrens’ Hospital, Oakland, CA) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). BAC clones
located at the Ch20P centromere (RP5-1025A1 and RP4738P15) were used to generate reference probes. The
method for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has
been described.23 The hybridization signals were counted
by 2 individuals. A signal ratio of experimental probe/reference probe greater than 3 is considered as amplification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Samples
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 77
ovarian cancers, including 60 OCCCs and 17 high-grade
ovarian serous carcinomas (OSCs), were used. All OCCC

Immunohistochemistry
Expression of ZNF217 and Ki-67 was assessed by immunohistochemistry and/or western blot analysis. The antibodies used in this study included a rabbit polyclonal

2847

Original Article

antibody that reacted with ZNF217 (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) and a mouse monoclonal MIB1 antibody that
reacted with Ki-67 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Immunohistochemistry studies for ZNF217 and Ki-67 were performed on tissue microarrays at a dilution of 1:50 and
1:100, respectively, followed by detection with the
EnVisionþ System using the peroxidase method
(DAKO). After antigen retrieval in a sodium citrate
buffer, slides were incubated with antibody overnight at
4 C. Slides for all samples were evaluated with a light
microscope by 2 researchers; the researchers were blinded
to clinicopathological factors. ZNF217 immunoreactivity
was scored by 2 investigators as follows: 0: undetectable,
1þ: weakly positive, 2þ: moderately positive, and 3þ:
intensely positive. ZNF217 immunoreactivity was not detectable (immunointensity score ¼ 0) in normal ovarian
epithelium. The evaluation criteria for Ki-67 expression
have been described.24
Cell Culture and Cell Lines
The human ovarian carcinoma cell lines MDAH2774
(serous carcinoma) and TOV-21G (clear cell carcinoma)
were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Center
(Rockville, MD). The OVK#18 (serous carcinoma)
human ovarian cancer cell line was obtained from Tohoku
University (Sendai, Japan). The JHOC5 (clear cell carcinoma) and JHOC9 (clear cell carcinoma) human ovarian
cancer cell lines were obtained from Riken Bioresource
Center (Ibaragi, Japan). The OVISE, OVMANA,
OVTOKO, and RMG1 cell lines were obtained from the
Japanese Health Science Research Resources Bank.
OV207 was a kind gift from Dr. Vijayalakshmi Shridhar
(Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN).
Western Blot Analysis
Cell lysates were prepared by dissolving cell pellets in
Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad, Hercules, CA) supplemented with 5% beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich,
Diessenhofen, Germany). Western blot analysis was
performed on ovarian cancer cell lines including OVISE,
OVMANA, OVTOKO, RMG1, MDAH2774,
OVK#18, TOV-21G, JHOC5, and JHOC9. Similar
amounts of total protein from each lysate were loaded
and separated on 10% Tris/glycine/sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and
electroblotted to Millipore Immobilon-P polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Mem-

2848

branes were probed with anti-ZNF217 antibody (1:100)
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:20,000). The
same membrane was probed with an antibody that
reacted with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(1:10,000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for
loading controls. Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Silencing RNA Knockdown of ZNF217 Gene
Expression
Two silencing RNAs (siRNAs) that targeted ZNF217
were designed with the following sense sequences: GAA
CAGAACCUCCCAAGGA and GAGGAUGCCU
UGUCAAUGA. Control siRNA (luciferase siRNA)
(UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUAC) was purchased from
IDT (Coralville, IA). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates
at a density of 4000 cells per well and transfected with siRNAs using oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Cell number was
determined indirectly by MTT assay 72 hours after transfection with siRNA.25 Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
uptake and staining were performed using a cell proliferation kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), and apoptotic cells were detected using an Annexin V staining kit
(Bio Vision, Mountain View, CA). The percentages of
BrdU-positive and Annexin V–positive cells were determined by counting approximately 400 cells from each
well in the 96-well plates. Data are expressed as the mean
 standard deviation of triplicate determinations.

Statistical Methods for Clinical Correlation
Overall survival was calculated from date of diagnosis to
date of death or last follow-up. Survival data were plotted
as Kaplan-Meier curves, and statistical significance was
determined by the log-rank test. Multivariate prognostic
analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards
model. Data were censored when patients were lost to follow-up. The Pearson correlation coefficient test was used
to examine statistical significance in differences between
DNA copy number and immunohistochemical analysis
values. The Student’s t test (for comparison of 2 groups)
or 1-way analysis of variance (for comparison of more
than 2 groups) were used to evaluate numerical data. The
chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used for comparisons of categorical data.

Figure 1. (A) Immunoreactivity of ZNF217 in ovarian clear cell carcinoma tissue is shown. Intense (3þ) immunoreactivity is present in the nuclei of ovarian clear cell carcinoma cells. (B) Moderate (2þ) immunoreactivity is present in the nuclei of ovarian clear

negative (0þ) ZNF217 staining is shown. (E) Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) validates amplification of the
ZNF217 gene in ovarian clear cell carcinomas. FISH analysis reveals a homogeneously stained region in the carcinoma portion
with ZNF217 gene amplification. In contrast, stromal cells on the same tissue section contain signals for both ZNF217 and reference probes with an approximately 1:1 ratio (right).

RESULTS
Identification of ZNF217 Amplification and
Correlation of ZNF217 Copy Number With
ZNF217 Protein Expression
ZNF217 amplification was identified in 12 (20.0%) of 60
OCCC samples. We also analyzed ZNF217 amplification
in 17 high-grade OSC samples to confirm whether
ZNF217 amplification is specific to OCCC. Expectedly,
none of the high-grade OSC samples (0/17, 0%) showed
ZNF217 amplification. Immunoreactivity of ZNF217

was detected in tumor cell nuclei (Figure 1). ZNF217
copy number correlated significantly with ZNF217
immunohistochemical intensity (r ¼ 0.341; P<.01).

FIGO stage, CA125 levels, Ki-67 labeling index, or endometriosis status. The frequency of ZNF217 amplification
in OCCCs (20.0% [12/60]) was significantly higher than
that in high-grade OSCs (0% [0/17]) (P<.05).
Patients were stratified into 1 of 2 groups depending
on ZNF217 immunohistochemical intensity. Overexpression of ZNF217 (ZNF217 immunointensity 2þ and 3þ)
was observed in 33% (20/60) of the analyzed tumors.
The relationships between ZNF217 protein expression and clinicopathological factors are shown in Table 1.

Survival
We looked for a possible prognostic effect of ZNF217
amplification or ZNF217 protein expression on progression-free survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free/

2850

overall survival are plotted in Figure 2. Amplification of
ZNF217 correlated with shorter progression-free survival
of patients with OCCCs treated with platinum agentbased chemotherapy. Of the total 60 patients with
OCCC, the 12 patients with ZNF217 amplification had
shorter progression-free survival than those without gene
amplification (P ¼ .0042; log-rank test) (Figure 2A). Univariate analysis demonstrated that FIGO stage III-IV
(P<.0001; log-rank test), CA125 levels (P ¼ .0087; logrank test), residual tumor 2 cm (P<.0001; log-rank
test), and ZNF217 amplification (P ¼ .0042; log-rank
test) correlated with shorter progression-free survival.
ZNF217 immunointensity did not influence progressionfree survival (P ¼ .2594) (Figure 2B). When data were
stratified for multivariate analysis, only ZNF217 amplification remained significantly (P ¼ .0042) associated with
shorter progression-free survival (Table 2).

Figure 2. ZNF217 amplification correlates with shorter progression-free/overall survival in patients who received primary cytoreductive surgery followed by standard platinum agent-based chemotherapy. (A) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis shows that ZNF217

those without ZNF217 amplification (P ¼ .0199; logrank test) (Figure 2C). Univariate analysis demonstrated
that FIGO stage III-IV (P<.0001; log-rank test), CA125

(P<.0001; log-rank test), and ZNF217 amplification
(P ¼ .0199; log-rank test) correlated with shorter overall
survival. Although high ZNF217 immunointensity was
associated with poor overall survival, this difference was

significantly reduced ZNF217 gene expression compared
with control siRNA treatment (Figure 4A). ZNF217
amplification correlated with growth inhibition and
induction of apoptosis by ZNF217 siRNA (Figure 4B, C).
Reduction of ZNF217 expression significantly inhibited
cell growth in ZNF217-expressing cells, including
JHOC9, OVMANA, and OV207 cells. A more prominent inhibitory effect was observed in ZNF217-amplified
JHOC9 and OVMANA cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, the
same treatment did not affect cell growth of OVISE,
RMG-1, or TOV-21G cells, which have moderate or
minimal ZNF217 expression, suggesting that OCCCs
with ZNF217 amplification are more dependent on activation of the ZNF217-related pathway for cell proliferation and survival than those without ZNF217
amplification. Inactivation of ZNF217 resulted in marked

2852

growth inhibition of carcinomas with ZNF217 amplification in comparison with only a modest effect on carcinomas featuring ZNF217 expression without ZNF217
amplification.
To assess mechanisms underlying growth inhibition
by siRNA for ZNF217, the percentages of BrdU-labeled
cells and Annexin V–labeled cells were measured to estimate proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. For apoptosis (Annexin V) and cell proliferation (BrdU-labeled
assay), 2 ZNF217-amplified cell lines, JHOC9 and
OVMANA, and 1 control cell line, the ZNF217 lowerexpression type MDAH2774, were selected. ZNF217
siRNA significantly induced apoptosis and reduced cellular proliferation in cell lines with ZNF217 amplification
compared with cell lines without ZNF217 amplification
(Figure 4C, D).

DISCUSSION
OCCC is usually more resistant to chemotherapy than
other types of ovarian cancers and has a poorer prognosis.5
The incidence of OCCC is increasing in East Asia, especially in Japan, in contrast to Europe and the United
States. Therefore, a new potential molecular target for
OCCC therapy needs to be developed, especially in Japan.
Some studies have reported that ZNF217 expression is
increased in ovarian cancer,14,15 and ZNF217 correlates
with other kinds of cancer progression and metastasis.19,20,26 In the current study, the higher frequency of
ZNF217 amplification in OCCC compared with highgrade OSCs is particularly interesting, because it suggests
that high-grade OSC and other types of ovarian carcinomas, including OCCC, may be distinguished based on
characteristic genetic alterations. Additionally, this observation further supports the theory that ovarian carcinoma
arises from multiple pathways.27,28 In this model, highgrade serous and other types of carcinomas develop independently from one another and are characterized by different molecular genetic changes and gene expression
profiles.9,29
Based on our combined FISH and immunohistochemical analysis, we found that ZNF217 gene copy numCancer

June 1, 2012

ber was significantly correlated with ZNF217 protein
expression. The current findings suggest that the mechanism of ZNF217 overexpression may be dependent on
gene amplification.
Biomarkers that can predict clinical prognosis,
including treatment response and overall survival, can
have a substantial clinical impact on the management of
patients with ovarian cancer.30 To further explore the
clinical relevance of ZNF217 alterations in OCCC, we
looked for and found a correlation between ZNF217
amplification or ZNF217 protein expression and length
of progression-free/overall survival in patients with
OCCC. Interestingly, a strong correlation between poor
prognosis and ZNF217 amplification was identified in
patients who received platinum agent-based chemotherapy. However, ZNF217 protein overexpression was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward poor overall
survival. The mechanism underlying the association
between ZNF217 amplification and shorter survival is not
known; however, because mortality of patients with
OCCC is directly related to recurrence of disease after
chemotherapy, it is conceivable that ZNF217 amplification may confer resistance to chemotherapy and/or
enhance cell proliferation in recurrent chemoresistant

tumors. Recently, Thollet et al31 reported that ZNF217
was involved in paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer
patients. The current findings of a positive relationship
between ZNF217 amplification and adverse patient outcomes may be explained by these reports and current biological findings. Because the etiology of tumor recurrence
is multifactorial, it is likely that ZNF217 amplification
confers a growth advantage to tumor cells by facilitating
proliferation and lowering apoptotic activity, as the present gene silencing study has shown. Taken together, these
observations may have an impact on clinical management.
Patients with recurrent OCCC may derive the benefit
from secondary cytoreduction if recurrent tumors are
small and localized.32-36 Therefore, patients with
ZNF217-amplified OCCC can be followed more frequently to enable detection of recurrences at an early

2854

enough stage to benefit from either secondary cytoreductive surgery or second-line chemotherapy.
In the present study, ZNF217 amplification had a
statistically significant effect on patient survival. These
findings were consistent with a recent report showing a
positive correlation between ZNF217 amplification and
clinical aggressiveness in colorectal, prostate, gastric, and
breast cancers.26,37-39 Taken together, the results of previous reports along with those of the current study suggest
that ZNF217 acts as a survival oncogene in several types of
carcinomas.
At present, one of the most significant molecular
genetic changes described in OCCC is the frequent somatic activating mutation of PIK3CA,11,12 which is
detected in approximately 40%-48% of OCCCs. The
PI3K-AKT oncogenic signaling pathway is thought to

Figure 4. (A) The efficacy of 2 ZNF217 silencing RNAs (siRNAs) in reducing ZNF217 gene expression was determined via quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in JHOC9 and OV207 cells. (B) Effects of ZNF217 siRNA on cell
proliferation are shown. Cells were counted after 96 hours of treatment with ZNF217 or control siRNA. The amplification status of
ZNF217 for each sample is shown under the cell line name. JHOC9 and OVMANA cells amplified the ZNF217 gene. Ovarian clear
cell carcinoma cells with ZNF217 amplification are more sensitive to growth inhibition by ZNF217 siRNA than cells without ZNF217
amplification. ZNF217 siRNA significantly reduces cell number in cell lines with ZNF217 amplification or overexpression, including
JHOC9, OVMANA, and OV207 cells, compared with cell lines without ZNF217 amplification or overexpression. The mean and
standard deviation (SD) were obtained from 3 experiments. *P<.05 versus RMG-I or OVISE. (C) Detection of apoptotic cells was
done by Annexin V labeling. The experiment was performed 72 hours after ZNF217 or control siRNA treatment. Apoptotic cells
were quantified by counting under a fluorescent microscope. The mean and SD were obtained from 3 experiments. (D) Detection
of proliferating cells was estimated by counting bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-stained cells under a fluorescent microscope. Treatment with ZNF217 siRNA decreased DNA synthesis as measured by BrdU uptake. The experiment was performed 72 hours after
ZNF217 or control siRNA treatment. Apoptotic cells were directly counted under a fluorescent microscope. The mean and SD

play an important role in OCCC pathogenesis. Recently,
Krig et al40 reported that ZNF217 regulates expression of
ErbB3, which results in the activation of the PI3K-AKT
pathway in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the present
results indicated that ZNF217 amplification and PIK3CA
mutation were almost mutually exclusive (data not
shown). Therefore, ZNF217 amplification without
PIK3CA mutation in OCCCs may activate PI3K-AKT
signaling via ErbB3 activation. Further examination is
required to clarify this hypothesis.
Because members of the Kruppel family are involved
in many aspects of growth, differentiation, and development, the precise function of ZNF217 and its possible
role in tumorigenesis cannot be predicted on the basis of
homology alone. ZNF217 protein localizes to the nucleus41 and co-immunoprecipitates with complexes containing the transcriptional corepressors CoREST and
CtBP, the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and 2, and the

Cancer

histone methyltransferases G9a and Eu-HMTase1.42,43
These data strongly suggest that ZNF217 may function as
part of a transcriptional repressor complex. Recently, we
reported that the transcriptional repressor NAC-1 also
had oncogenic potential in ovarian cancer.44-46 Thus far,
several transcriptional repressors with oncogenic potential
in various malignant tumors have been reported.44,47-49
Taken together, the results of previous reports along with
those of the current study suggest that transcriptional
repressors act as oncogenes in several types of cancer.
In the present study, a genotype–phenotype correlation in ovarian cancer cells was performed using ZNF217
siRNA. OCCCs with ZNF217 amplification were more
sensitive to growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis
by ZNF217 siRNA. These observations suggest that
OCCCs with ZNF217 gene amplification are more dependent on activation of cell proliferation and survival
than those without such amplification. These findings

suggest that ZNF217 is one of the driver genes responsible
for significant cell growth and survival effects in OCCC;
thus, the current results support a recently proposed phenomenon called ‘‘oncogene addiction.’’50 Cancer cells
contain multiple genetic and epigenetic abnormalities.
Despite this complexity, their growth and survival can often be impaired by inactivation of a single oncogene. This
dependence on a single oncogene, called ‘‘oncogene addiction,’’ provides the rationale for molecularly targeted
therapies that target these important oncogenes.50 In light
of this theory and the present in vivo and in vitro findings,
we propose that OCCC patients with ZNF217 gene
amplification should be considered for therapies that specifically inhibit ZNF217 if their disease recurs after conventional platinum agent-based chemotherapy, or for
first-line ZNF217-specific inhibitor therapy along with a
conventional platinum agent-based combination.
In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that phenotypic change in OCCC in response to
ZNF217 inactivation depends on ZNF217 gene amplification status. The present findings provide new insight
into the biological roles of the ZNF217 signaling pathway
in OCCC. In addition, the present observations have an
important therapeutic implication for patients with
OCCC that demonstrates ZNF217 amplification.
OCCC with ZNF217 amplification is associated with the
most clinically aggressive behavior of all ovarian cancers.5,51,52 Therefore, detection of ZNF217 amplification
in OCCC may identify patients who will benefit from
ZNF217-specific inhibitor therapy.
