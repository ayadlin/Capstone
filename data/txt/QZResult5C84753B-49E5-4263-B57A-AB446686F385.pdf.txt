BACKGROUND: Several sirtuin family members (SIRT1-7), which are evolutionarily conserved NAD-dependent
deacetylases, play an important role in carcinogenesis. However, their role in oral cancer has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether sirtuins play a role in oral cancer carcinogenesis. METHODS: The expression levels of all sirtuins in several oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines were
compared with normal human oral keratinocytes and observed that SIRT3 was highly expressed. Therefore, tissue
microarrays were used to evaluate the clinical relevance of this overexpression. SIRT3 down-regulation in OSCC cell
proliferation and survival was investigated and analyzed by using cell-proliferation and cell-viability assays. Ionizing
radiation and cisplatin were used to investigate whether SIRT3 down-regulation could increase the sensitivity of
OSCC to both treatments. To further assess the in vivo role of SIRT3 in OSCC carcinogenesis, a floor-of-mouth oral
cancer murine model was used to study the effect of SIRT3 down-regulation on OSCC tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: The current results demonstrated for the first time that SIRT3 is overexpressed in OSCC in vitro
and in vivo compared with other sirtuins. Down-regulation of SIRT3 inhibited OSCC cell growth and proliferation and
increased OSCC cell sensitivity to radiation and cisplatin treatments in vitro. SIRT3 down-regulation also reduced tumor burden in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The current investigation revealed a novel role for SIRT3 in oral cancer carcinogenesis as a promoter of cell proliferation and survival, thus implicating SIRT3 as a new potential therapeutic target

Oral cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide, and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for
>90% of all oral malignancies.1 The 5-year survival rates for patients with OSCC range from 34% to 62.9%, and those
rates have not changed for decades.2 This underscores the need for new therapeutic targets to treat oral cancer. Recently, it
was reported that several members of the sirtuin family (SIRT1-7), the human homologues of the Sir2 gene in yeast, play
an important role in carcinogenesis.3 Sirtuins function either as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent
deacetylases or as ADP-ribosyl transferases, which explains their involvement in a diversity of cellular functions, including
regulation of oxidative stress, increasing genomic stability, cell survival, development, metabolism, aging, and longevity.4,5
SIRT1, the best characterized family member, targets several key regulators that affect carcinogenesis, such as the tumor
suppressor p53, the DNA repair protein Ku70, and the proapoptotic protein forkhead box O (FOXO) protein.3,6 Current
literature supports a prosurvival role for SIRT1 in colon, breast, and lung cancers through 1 or more of these previously
mentioned targets.3 In contrast, other reports indicate that SIRT1 may act as a tumor suppressor.7,8
Although much is known about SIRT1, less is known about other mammalian Sir2 homologues, such as SIRT3.
SIRT3, which is the only member linked to longevity in humans,9-11 is a mitochondrial protein12-18 that is overexpressed
in and associated with lymph node-positive breast cancer.19 Moreover, during stress, SIRT3 levels increase, protecting
cells from apoptosis. Thus, like SIRT1, SIRT3 may bind and deacetylate Ku70, promoting Ku70-Bax interactions and
attenuating apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.20 In addition, mitochondrial SIRT3 is required for Nampt, a stress and dietCorresponding author: Yvonne L. Kapila, DDS, PhD, Department of Periodontics and Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI

responsive regulator of mitochondrial NADþ levels, to
promote cell survival during genotoxicity.21 More
recently, it was reported that SIRT3 abrogates p53 activity, thus preventing growth arrest and senescence in bladder carcinoma cells.22 These findings suggest a role for
SIRT3 in carcinogenesis; however, to our knowledge, the
role of sirtuins has not been investigated in oral cancer.
Therefore, the objective of the current study was to elucidate the role of sirtuins in oral cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Culture
The human OSCC cell line HSC-3 was provided by
Randy Kramer (University of California-San Francisco,
San Francisco, Calif), and the OSCC cell lines UM-SCC1 and UM-SCC-17B were provided by Tom Carey (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich). Primary human
keratinocytes were derived from normal gingival tissues
that were discarded from periodontal surgical procedures
and were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. OSCC cells were maintained in
Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco,
Carlsbad, Calif) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Primary human
oral keratinocytes were maintained in EpiLife medium
(Cascade Biologics, Portland, Ore).
Transient transfection

Cells were transiently transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) (150 nM; a pool of 3 target-specific
siRNA) against SIRT3 or with a nontargeting control
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif) in serumfree medium that contained Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). Transfection efficiency was assessed
by Western blot analysis.
Stable transfection

UM-SCC-17B cells were transduced with SIRT3short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (sc61555-vs) or scrambledshRNA (sc-108084; both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) lentiviral particles in 0.5 mL of serum-free media,
then selected in 10 lg/mL puromycin for an additional
10 days (sc-108071; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Surviving cell colonies were picked and propagated before
testing for SIRT3 expression.
Cell-proliferation and colony-formation assays

liferation, the QUANT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit was
used according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). For colony-formation assays, OSCC cells were
transfected as described above and were cultured for
1 week. Colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet,
and the colonies that contained >50 cells were counted.
Apoptosis cell death detection by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay

To measure apoptosis in vitro, a DNA-fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Ind).
Immunoblot analysis

To evaluate the expression levels of sirtuins in
OSCC cells compared with normal primary human keratinocytes or the transfection/transduction efficiency of
cells, cells were treated as described above and in figure
legends, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and
lysed in RIPA buffer (R0278, Sigma) that contained 1%
protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma) on ice for 30
minutes. Lysates were adjusted for protein concentration
with the BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif).
Lysate proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica,
Mass). Western blot analysis was performed with various
primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit or antimouse IgG antibodies, and blots
were developed with the ECL-Plus detection system
(Pierce, Rockford, Ill). Antibodies for SIRT1 (sc-15404)
and SIRT2 (sc-20966) were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The SIRT3 antibody (2627) was obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, Mass). Antibodies to SIRT4 (IMG-3580), SIRT5 (IMG-479), and
SIRT7 (IMG-425) were obtained from Imgenex (Bhubaneshwar, India). The SIRT6 antibody (AP6245a) was
obtained from ABGENT (San Diego, Calif). To demonstrate equal protein loading, membranes were stripped
and reprobed with an anti-b-actin antibody (sc-1615;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Tissue microarrays

Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to
determine the expression of SIRT3 and SIRT7 in human
normal and OSCC tissues using OSCC tissue microarrays
(OR601 and HN241; US Biomax, Inc., Rockville, Md)
and the Histostatin Kit (95-6143; Zymed Laboratories,
South San Francisco, Calif) according to the

manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies to SIRT3
(AP6242a) and SIRT7 (AP6246a) were obtained from
ABGENT. Staining intensities were graded in a blinded
manner as either low or high by a pathologist.
Immunodeficient mouse model of human head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma

Three-week-old athymic nude mice (NCr-nu/nu
strain; National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Md) that
weighed between 20 and 25 g were anesthetized by
intraperitoneal injection with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10
mg/kg xylazine. The human OSCC cell line UM-SCC17B that stably expressed SIRT3-shRNA or scrambledshRNA was grown to 70% confluence before injection. We
used a murine floor-of-mouth model, which we previously
optimized to produce 4-mm to 5-mm tumors, corresponding to a palpable tumor volume of 35 mm3 to 60 mm3,
within approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the injection.23 In
brief, cells were suspended in DMEM, chilled on ice, and
resuspended in an equal volume of growth factor-reduced
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif; catalog no.
354230) to a final concentration of 2.5  105/0.1 mL. The
cell/Matrigel solution was chilled on ice before injection,
and each animal was injected with an equal number of
OSCC cells (2.5  105) submucosally in the floor of the
mouth. After 3 weeks, the mice were euthanized, and a digital caliper was used to determine the tumor volume using
the formula a  a  b/2, where a is the smaller dimension.
Statistical Analysis
Values were expressed as means  standard deviation.
Intergroup differences were determined by using a 2-way
ANOVA and the Scheffe multiple-comparison test. Statistical significance was defined as *P  .05, **P  .01,
and ***P  .001. For tissue microarray analyses, the chisquare test was used. For the in vivo studies, independent
t tests with unequal variances were used. All experiments
were repeated at least 3 times.

RESULTS
SIRT3 Is Overexpressed in Oral Squamous
Cell Carcinomas
To determine whether sirtuins play a role in OSCC, we
examined the protein levels of all sirtuins (SIRT1-7) in
several OSCC cell lines (HSC-3, UM-SCC-1, and UMSCC-17B) and compared those cells with normal primary
human oral keratinocytes (Fig. 1A). Only SIRT3 and, to a
lesser extent, SIRT7 were overexpressed in all 3 cell lines
compared with primary keratinocytes. To further examine

1672

the in vivo and clinical relevance of SIRT3 and SIRT7,
immunohistochemical analyses were performed for both
sirtuins using tissue microarrays of OSCCs. In all, 52
samples were analyzed, including 42 malignant tumor
samples and 10 normal tissue samples. Grade 1, 2, and 3
tumors from the tongue, cheek, gingiva, lip, and oral mucosa were analyzed along with normal tissues from the
tongue, palate, and gingiva (Table 1). Staining intensity
was assessed as either low or high (Table 1). SIRT3 expression was significantly higher in OSCC tissues compared
with normal tissues (P  .05) (Fig. 1B, Table 1), whereas
SIRT7 expression levels did not differ significantly (data
not shown). SIRT3 staining intensity data from Table 1
are illustrated in Figure 1C. SIRT3 exhibited an opposite
pattern of expression between OSCC and normal tissues
(Fig. 1C, top). Furthermore, because the tongue accounts
for 30% of oral malignancies,1 we specifically examined
tongue samples separately. SIRT3 staining intensity was
significantly higher in OSCC tongue samples compared
with normal tongue tissue samples (P  .04) (Fig. 1C,
bottom; Table 1).
The Sirtuin Inhibitors Sirtinol and
Nicotinamide Inhibit Cell Growth and
Proliferation and Induce Apoptosis
After we established that sirtuins (and specifically SIRT3)
were associated with OSCC, we explored the role of
sirtuins in modulating OSCC cell growth and proliferation. To this end, we tested the commonly used sirtuin
inhibitors sirtinol and nicotinamide (NAM), which inhibit cell growth in breast and lung cancers.24,25 Both
inhibitors inhibited cell growth and proliferation in
OSCC cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, both inhibitors
induced apoptosis in OSCC cells compared with
untreated controls, as determined by cell-death ELISA
assays, which are used to measure DNA fragmentation
(Fig. 2B).
SIRT3 Down-Regulation Inhibits Cell Growth
and Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis in
Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells
To gain further insight into the effects of SIRT3 on
OSCC cell survival and proliferation, we performed colony-formation assays in the context of SIRT3 inhibition
with siRNA. Like in the cell growth studies, SIRT3
down-regulation inhibited colony formation in OSCC
cells compared with controls (Fig. 3A). Furthermore,
down-regulation of SIRT3 also promoted apoptosis in
OSCC cells, mimicking the effect of sirtinol and NAM
on these cells (Fig. 3B).

SIRT3 Down-Regulation Enhances the
Sensitivity of Oral Squamous Cell
Carcinoma Cells to Radiation-Induced and
Cisplatin-Induced Cytotoxicity
Because radiation is the primary treatment modality in
head and neck cancer, and cisplatin is 1 of the first chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat OSCC,26 we investigated
whether SIRT3 down-regulation with siRNA enhances
the sensitivity of OSCC cells to radiation and cisplatin.

Cancer

Cytotoxicity assays were performed first to optimize ionizing radiation (IR) and cisplatin (CDDP) doses and determine the 50% inhibitory concentration for both
treatments in all cell lines (data not shown). Indeed,
down-regulation of SIRT3 with siRNA enhanced the sensitivity of the UM-SCC-1 and UM-SCC-17B cell lines to
both treatments compared with untreated controls and
with cells that were treated radiation or cisplatin alone
(Fig. 4).

SIRT3 Down-Regulation Reduces Oral
Squamous Cell Carcinoma Tumor
Burden in Vivo
To further demonstrate the role of SIRT3 in OSCC carcinogenesis in vivo, we used a murine floor-of-mouth
model that mimics human OSCC.23,27 The UM-SCC17B cell line was selected for examination in this model
because of its highly aggressive nature and its resistance to
radiation therapy, and because it commonly produces
tumors in this in vivo model.23 The UM-SCC-17B cell
line was used to produce stable clones that expressed
down-regulated levels of SIRT3 using SIRT3-shRNA,
and scrambled-shRNA was used for controls (Fig. 5A).
SIRT3-shRNA (Clone 4) and scrambled-shRNA (Clone
1) were selected for the in vivo injections. In agreement
with our in vitro data, our mouse model data indicated
that the down-regulation of SIRT3 in OSCC cells significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 5B). Specifically, the mean tumor volumes for the SIRT3 down-

DISCUSSION
Here, we report for the first time a role for sirtuins and,
specifically, for SIRT3 in OSCC carcinogenesis. There is
emerging evidence of a role for several sirtuins in carcinogenesis.4 However, to our knowledge, their role in oral
cancer has not been investigated previously. Thus, we
explored their potential role in OSCC by evaluating their
expression levels in several OSCC cell lines compared
with normal human oral keratinocytes. Our initial finding
that SIRT3 was overexpressed in OSCC cells compared
with normal human oral keratinocytes led us to hypothesize that SIRT3 may play a role in OSCC carcinogenesis.
Thus, to further explore the clinical relevance of this overexpression, we used tissue microarray analyses of OSCC
tissues. The high expression levels of SIRT3 in OSCC
tissues compared with normal tissues further supported a
role for SIRT3 in oral cancer carcinogenesis. Sirtuin
inhibitors, such as sirtinol and NAM, which have been
used to inhibit cell growth in several types of cancers, such
as breast and lung cancers,24 also inhibited cell growth
and proliferation and induced apoptosis in several OSCC
cell lines.
Although some investigators have suggested a proapoptotic role for SIRT3,28-30 others have suggested a prosurvival role.20-22,31 In addition, some reports suggest that
SIRT3 is exclusively a mitochondrial protein12-18; however, others have reported that SIRT3 can be observed in
the cytosol and nucleus during different cellular
events.20,32,33 Those reports underscore the complexity of
the biologic functions of sirtuins, which may differ
according to their tissue of origin or cancer type. For
example, SIRT1 functions in the neural system to promote neural cell survival and to protect against genomic
toxicity30; however, this may not be true in all cancer
types. There is a discrepancy in the literature regarding
the role of SIRT1 in cancer.7,8,24 After investigating the
effect of SIRT1 in several cancer types, Stunkel et al34
concluded that the function of SIRT1 in cancer is cellcontext-dependent and that the role of SIRT1 can be
independent of its deacetylase function. This cell specificity also may be true for SIRT3. When SIRT3 is overexpressed in cardiomyocytes, it increases stress resistance
and plays a protective role against cell death and apoptosis.20 SIRT3 also seems to play a protective role against

cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.35 Furthermore,
SIRT3 is overexpressed in breast cancer, and it was shown
to modulate p53 activity, preventing growth arrest and senescence in bladder carcinoma cells.19,22 Because our current findings indicate that SIRT3 is overexpressed in
OSCC tissues and cells (Fig. 1), we surmised that SIRT3
also plays a prosurvival role in oral cancer.
Our current data indicate that SIRT3 levels are elevated in head and neck cancer and that the suppression of
SIRT3 levels reduces several tumorigenic parameters in
vitro and in vivo. In contrast, in a recent study, other
investigators speculated about the role of SIRT3 in head
and neck cancer by reviewing published gene array data
from another source and observed that SIRT3 levels are
decreased in head and neck cancer.36 Those findings are
contradictory to findings in the current report; however,
it must be noted that those studies were limited, because
they reviewed only gene array studies and did not include
the kinds of full functional assessment of SIRT3 in vitro
and in vivo that were part of the current study.

The Role of SIRT3 in Oral Cancer/Alhazzazi et al

The down-regulation of SIRT3 inhibited colony
formation and induced apoptosis in OSCC cells. In addition, we investigated whether SIRT3 could modulate the
sensitivity of OSCC cells to both IR and cisplatin treatment. We tested UM-SCC-1 cells and UM-SCC-17B
cells, both of which are highly resistant to radiation,37,38
and the former cells also are resistant to cisplatin treatment (data not shown). Our data demonstrated that
SIRT3 down-regulation sensitized OSCC cells to both IR
and cisplatin treatment, indicating that SIRT3 is important in the modulation of OSCC-induced resistance to
both treatments. Thus, targeting SIRT3 to induce OSCC
cell cytotoxicity in patients who have high SIRT3-expressing tumors may be advantageous, because lower doses of
treatment would be required. Furthermore, SIRT3 may
serve as an adjunctive target to improve the efficacy and
decrease the side effects of conventional treatments. In
addition, although SIRT3-deficient mice had hyperacetylated mitochondrial proteins, they were surprisingly
healthy, with normal bone mineral density and an unremarkable phenotype compared with wild-type SIRT3
mice.18 This suggests that targeting SIRT3 in oral cancer
may be less toxic to normal cells versus cancer cells. Parenthetically, gene deletions of other sirtuins produce more
aggressive and lethal phenotypes.39,40
To further demonstrate the important role of
SIRT3 in OSCC carcinogenesis, we used an in vivo
murine floor-of-mouth model that mimicked human
OSCC.23,27 This model has the advantage that tumors
injected into the floor of the mouth behave like human
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, growing in the
same environment, growing aggressively, and invading
surrounding tissues. It is noteworthy that our data indicate that tumor cells with low levels of SIRT3 grow
slower, produce smaller tumors, and have less tumor volume compared with controls (Fig. 3, Table 1). These
findings support the in vitro data and indicate that SIRT3
plays an important role in oral cancer carcinogenesis in
vivo.
In summary, our findings reveal a novel role for
SIRT3 in oral cancer carcinogenesis as a modulator of cell
proliferation and survival, supported by in vitro and in
vivo data. This implicates SIRT3 as a new potential therapeutic target for treating oral cancer.
