dence with age. Chromosomal abnormalities in ALL have been frequently
described, the most common is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). The resulting
fusion gene, BCR-ABL1, encodes for a chimerical oncoprotein (BCR-ABL) with
reduced apoptosis, and impaired cell adhesion. Treating Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph1) ALL patients with conventional chemotherapy has not substantially improved their long-term outcomes. Recently, however, BCR-ABL–
targeted strategies have been successfully adopted. Imatinib is an oral competitive inhibitor of ABL with demonstrated phase 2 efficacy in patients with treatment-naive and pretreated ALL. Despite its efficacy, imatinib may induce specific
resistance in a large proportion of patients, mainly because of the occurrence of
ABL1 mutations. Therefore, novel inhibitors have been developed. Dasatinib is a
multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL, SRC, C-KIT, PDGFRs, and ephrin A receptor kinases. Unlike imatinib, it binds both the active and inactive BCR-ABL as
well as the majority of ABL mutants. Dasatinib is approved for treatment of imatinib-pretreated Ph1 ALL, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on the basis of
phase 2 trials that demonstrated impressive efficacy and favorable tolerability
profiles. Nilotinib is another BCR-ABL targeted agent that is similar in structure
to imatinib but has significantly greater binding affinity. It also has demonstrated
promising efficacy in Ph1 ALL but is still being evaluated in phase 2 trials. In

Pathophysiology of Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoid
Leukemia (ALL)
ALL is a heterogeneous disorder deriving from transformation of hematopoietic stem cells and, possibly, from lymphoid-committed
progenitor cells.1–3 In particular, ALL is the most common type of
malignancy diagnosed in children, with an annual occurrence of
approximately 30 cases per million and a peak incidence occurring
between the ages of 3–4 years.4,5 In adults, ALL is less common,
with approximately 7–18 cases per million diagnosed each year,
although a second peak incidence occurs after the age of 70 years.5,6
Chromosomal abnormalities have been frequently described in this

disease; the most common in adult ALL is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), a truncated derivative of
chromosome 22 that arises from the translocation of
genetic material between this chromosome and chromosome 9 (t9,22[q34;q11]).6 The resulting fusion
gene, BCR-ABL1 (Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson
murine leukemia viral proto-oncogene), encodes for
an abnormal, nonmembrane-bound oncoprotein. The
oncoprotein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase
that perturbs numerous signal transduction pathways
resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation, reduced
apoptosis, and impaired cell adhesion, and it has
been shown to transform cells in culture by producing
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and ALL-like syndromes in mice.7 Two fusion proteins of different sizes
may be produced – p190 and p210. The p190 protein
is found in approximately two-thirds of adults and in
>90% of pediatric cases of Philadelphia chromosomepositive (Ph1) ALL, whereas p210 is typically found in
patients with CML.8 Although p190 and p210 are provided with different transforming properties, the exact
biochemical differences in their signaling are largely
unknown. In addition, it is not established whether

the 2 proteins behave differently concerning their
response to different inhibitors. BCR-ABL is associated
with deregulated and increased ABL tyrosine kinase
activity,9 demonstrating activation in multiple signal
transduction pathways, including Ras/Raf/mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK); phosphatidylinositol
3 kinase; STAT5/Janus kinase; and Myc.7,10,11 Many of
these pathways are used by cytokines to regulate
hematopoiesis, thereby allowing BCR-ABL to prolong
survival and to increase proliferation of cells in early
leukemogenesis. BCR-ABL has also been shown to associate directly with some of the SRC family tyrosine
kinases, including Lyn and Hck, which facilitate BCRABL coupling to pathways related to transformation.7
Approximately 20%–30% of adult ALL patients
present with Ph abnormality; notably, the prevalence
of (t9,22[q34;q11]) increases with age, being greater
in elderly rather than in young adults and children.12
Despite age, both adult and pediatric patients with
Ph1 ALL typically have a poorer prognosis than
patients without this chromosomal abnormality.13
Disease-free survival (DFS) rates at 2 years have been
estimated to be only 10%–15% in Ph1 ALL patients

who were treated with nonimatinib-based chemotherapy regimens.14
Until recently, the only treatment options for
patients with Ph1 ALL were conventional chemotherapy and, for a minority of cases, allogeneic stemcell transplantation. Clinical results in adults before
the availability of imatinib are summarized in Table
1 and were recently reviewed by Piccaluga et al.15–30

BCR-ABL1 as a Therapeutic Target in Ph1 ALL
Because the role of tyrosine kinases in the molecular
pathogenesis of ALL has been well described, they
make logical anticancer therapeutic targets. As
shown in Figure 1, tyrosine kinases bind adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and catalyze the transfer of a
phosphate group to the hydroxy group of a tyrosine
residue on a protein participating in a signal transduction cascade.9,31

Inhibition of tyrosine kinases by ATP competitive
inhibitors has been a recent focus for new drug
design. In this article, we review the evidence for tyrosine kinase inhibitors in adult Ph1 ALL.

Imatinib for Relapsed Ph1 ALL
Imatinib mesylate (formerly STI571 and Gleevec;
Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) is an oral
potent competitive inhibitor of ABL that has the ability to induce hematologic and cytogenic remissions
(CyRs) in CML. Several phase 1 and 2 studies have
evaluated the role of imatinib for the treatment of
patients with relapsed or refractory Ph1 ALL (Table
2).32–35 These studies have reported a complete
remission rate of approximately 20%, with 60% of
patients achieving remission or clearance of peripheral blood blasts. Notably, molecular response was
achieved in some cases. Unfortunately, these results

are not long lasting, with median times to disease
progression and overall survival rates of 2.2 and 4.9
months, respectively. Interestingly, favorable outcomes
of 51% disease-free survival after 1 year have been
reported in subsets of patients that underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation during remission.36
Interestingly, our group and others have shown
that imatinib alone is able to induce molecular complete remission in patients with advanced Ph1 ALL
and minimal residual disease after 2, 4, and 8 weeks
of treatment was predictive of outcome.34,35

Imatinib as Frontline Therapy for Ph1 ALL
Several clinical studies have explored the role of imatinib as frontline therapy for Ph1 ALL disease by using
various strategies as follows: in combination with
induction and consolidation chemotherapy; as a single
agent; and before stem cell transplantation (Table 3).
The combination of imatinib has been evaluated with
a variety of chemotherapy regimens including hyperCVAD,37 and high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine.38
These studies report high complete remission of
approximately 95% with encouraging overall survival
rates of 88% at 1 year and acceptable toxicities.
Debate remains over whether concurrent or sequential regimens are most appropriate for Ph1 ALL,
with a recent study by Wassmann et al. providing
some clarity.39 In a study of 92 patients with newly
diagnosed Ph1 ALL, 2 treatment schedules with imatinib administered concurrent to or alternating with
a uniform induction and consolidation regimen were
evaluated. Concurrent administration of imatinib
and chemotherapy resulted in a complete remission
rate of 95% and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
negativity for BCR-ABL in 52% of patients, compared
with 19% in patients in the alternating treatment
cohort (P 5 .01).
Additional studies that used imatinib as singleagent induction in elderly patients with newly diag-

nosed Ph1 ALL disease suggest that imatinib alone
may be superior to chemotherapy in elderly patients
(100% overall response vs 46% failures).40,41 Overall,
the addition of imatinib to induction and consolidation regimens has almost certainly increased their
antileukemic efficacy and will possibly influence
achievement of improved long-term outcomes.42
Notably, the addition of imatinib to chemotherapy
may also improve the curative potential of stem cell
transplantation. In 1 study with 29 patients who had
completed induction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a significantly
greater number of patients treated with imatinib
were transplanted, with sustained complete remission creating lower relapses and greater disease-free
survival compared with historical controls (78% vs
39%, P 5 .001).43

Development of Resistance During Imatinib Therapy
Tumor cells can develop various mechanisms of resistance during therapy. Some of these mechanisms
include up-regulation of alternative signaling pathways, drug-resistant variants of targeted proteins,
and increased expression of drug efflux proteins.44
Despite initial hematologic or cytologic responses,
many patients with Ph1 ALL become refractory to
imatinib, or they relapse within several months. Primary or innate resistance is defined as a failure to
achieve a complete remission despite therapeutic
levels of imatinib. Secondary or acquired resistance
to imatinib arises in the form of a relapse after an
initial complete remission has been obtained. Several
mechanisms of drug resistance in Ph1 leukemias
have been postulated including 1) expression of a
rapid drug efflux protein, or extracellular binding of
drug molecules44; 2) Non–BCR-ABL-dependent transforming events involving SRC family; and 3) BCRABL–dependent events involving genetic changes in
the ATP binding site that lead to decreased imatinib
binding affinity.42 Genetic mutations in BCR-ABL

1182

CANCER

result in several possible changes as follows: the
overexpression of BCR-ABL45; disruption of contact
points between imatinib,46 and BCR-ABL and/or
structural changes that activate BCR-ABL preventing
the inhibitor from binding.47,48 Interestingly, the
effect of additional cytogenetic abnormalities has not
yet been well established.
Recently, Pfeifer et al.49 analyzed the ABL1 mutational status in 94 patients with relapsed Ph1 ALL or
lymphoid blast crisis CML. They showed that tyrosine kinase domain mutations emerged in 54% and
83% of patients treated with imatinib alone or in
combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In
contrast, mutations were detected in only 18% of
patients who had relapsed after stem cell transplantation and who had not been treated with imatinib.
The vast majority (74%) of the mutations were found
in the P-loop domain, whereas the T315I was the
second most common (17%) location for mutations.
This is noteworthy, because the latter mutation
appears to confer resistance to imatinib as well as to
novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors.50,51 Interestingly, in
many cases, it was possible to detect the same mutation both before imatinib administration and again
at relapse, thus suggesting that effective treatment of
Ph1 ALL will require the up-front use of agents
effective against mutant BCR-ABL1.49 Finally, it should
be underlined that resistance to TKI may reflect their
inability to suppress leukemic stem cells, even though
this phenomenon is still largely obscure.
Figure 2 summarizes potential mechanisms of
resistance to imatinib postulated to occur in patients
with Ph1 leukemias.
In summary, the use of imatinib has most likely
improved clinical outcomes in patients with Ph1
ALL. However, patients do relapse, and other therapeutic options are required. Patients who have failed
or relapsed on imatinib-based therapy will typically
follow a rapid and aggressive course of disease. Disappointing results observed in cases of imatinib resistance have led to the development and testing of
novel noncross-resistant inhibitors, as described in
the section below.

Rational Design of Novel Kinase Inhibitors for Ph1 ALL
Two novel therapies designed to inhibit wild-type
and mutant forms of BCR-ABL and/or other molecular targets have been tested in clinical settings:
dasatinib (formerly BMS 354825 and Sprycel; BristolMyers Squibb, New York, New York) and nilotinib
(formerly AMN107; Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland).
Dasatinib is a novel, oral, potent, multitargeted
kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC kinases (so-

called dual inhibitor) that has been approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment
of adults with Ph1 ALL with resistance or intolerance
to prior therapy. It has also been approved for the
treatment of adults with chronic phase, acute phase,
or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML with resistance to or intolerance of prior therapy, including
imatinib. Its wide range of oncogenic targets include
BCR-ABL, SRC kinases (including LYN, HCK, and
C-KIT),52 PDGFRs, and ephrin A receptor kinase.52–54
Dasatinib has a 325-fold greater affinity for BCR-ABL
than imatinib.53 Unlike nilotinib and imatinib, it can
bind both inactive and active conformations of BCRABL.52 (Fig. 3)
Because of its less stringent binding requirements, dasatinib has demonstrated inhibitory activity
against imatinib-resistant mutations with the exception of T315I.51,55

Dasatinib for Ph1 ALL Refractory to, or Intolerant of,
Imatinib
A phase 1 dose-escalation study evaluated the safety
and efficacy of dasatinib in 84 patients with imatinib-intolerant or resistant leukemias, including
patients with Ph1 ALL disease as follows: 10 patients
with lymphoid blast-phase CML or Ph1 ALL; 40
patients with chronic-phase CML; 11 patients with
accelerated-phase CML; and, 23 patients with myeloid blast-phase CML.56 Dasatinib was administered
at a dose of 15–240 mg either as 1 dose or twice a
day. The main toxicity was grade 3 or 4 myelosup-

pression, which was effectively managed by dose
modification. After a median follow-up of 5 to 12
months, clinical hematologic responses were maintained in 82% of accelerated-phase CML patients
and 95% of chronic-phase CML patients, respectively.
The major cytogenetic response (MCyR) rates were
25% and 45%, respectively. Although most patients
with Ph1 ALL or myeloid blast-phase CML relapsed
in 6 months, responses occurred across all mutant
BCR-ABL genotypes except for the T315I. Because of
these promising phase 1 results, phase 2 studies
were initiated.
The START program (SRC-ABL Tyrosine kinase
inhibition Activity Research Trials) included 5 studies, ongoing at the time of approval, and investigating the safety and efficacy of dasatinib in patients
with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML or Ph1
ALL diseases as follows: chronic-phase CML57; accelerated-phase CML58; myeloid blast phase59; lymphoid blast-phase CML or Ph1 ALL59,60; and, chronicphase CML compared with high-dose imatinib.61
The registration study demonstrated the effectiveness of dasatinib in patients with Ph1 ALL or

lymphoid blast-phase CML on hematologic and cytogenic response endpoints. This was an open-label
study (CA180015 START-L) conducted in 42 centers
worldwide, which enrolled 94 patients with imatinibresistant or imatinib-intolerant lymphoid blast CML
(n 5 48) or Ph1 ALL (n 5 46). Dasatinib was administered twice daily at a dose of 70 mg orally with
escalation to 100 mg in patients with poor response
or dose reductions to 40 mg twice daily in patients
experiencing toxicity. Among patients with Ph1 ALL
disease, 44 patients were resistant to imatinib with
78% (of 40 patients with baseline mutation data)
expressing BCR-ABL mutations. The dasatinib dose
was reduced in 30% of ALL patients and temporarily
interrupted in 43%. At minimum 9 months of followup, the results yielded efficacy in the trial’s primary
endpoint. Major hematologic response (MaHR) was
45%, including 35% complete hematologic response,
and a high rate of cytogenetic complete remissions.
The median duration of MaHR was 11 months, and
progression-free survival was 3.7 months. Among all
patients, the most frequent hematologic adverse events
were grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia,
with diarrhea, nausea, pyrexia, and pleural effusion as
major nonhematologic toxicities. Dasatinib demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful activity in
heavily pretreated patients with Ph1 ALL.60,62,63

Similar to imatinib, nilotinib can bind only the inactive conformation of the ABL kinase domain but with
a 25-fold greater affinity than imatinib. Nilotinib has
demonstrated activity in imatinib-resistant mutations, with the exception of T315I.46,64 In a phase 1
study that included patients with either imatinib-resistant CML or Ph1 ALL, 10% of Ph1 ALL patients
enrolled (n 5 10) achieved complete hematologic
responses with no cytogenetic responses following treatment with nilotinib. Grade 3–4 adverse events reported
in this study included hematologic toxicity, rash, and
hyperbilirubinemia.65 In another phase 1 study, mutations in BCR-ABL were correlated with response in 119
patients with imatinib-resistant Ph1 CML or ALL. In the
86 patients who had pretreatment and post-treatment
analyses, 27 (69%) patients with baseline mutations
responded, whereas the response rate was 55% in those
with no mutations at baseline. Results of this phase 1
study are summarized in Table 5.65

CONCLUSIONS
The use of targeted therapies such as imatinib
against BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase has led to significant improvements in the treatment of patients with
Ph1 ALL. Unfortunately, relapses do occur. With a
growing understanding of the molecular basis for
imatinib resistance, including BCR-ABL1 gene mutations and the development of BCR-ABL independent
pathways, novel drugs are being evaluated. The second generation small tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, has demonstrated robust clinical activity in
patients with Ph1 ALL resistant to or intolerant of
imatinib. Combined with a favorable tolerability profile, the recent approval of dasatinib provides a new
option for patients with Ph1 ALL and heralds a significant breakthrough in this difficult-to-treat patient
population (Tables 2 and 3). Nilotinib, which is still
under evaluation in phase 2 trials, may represent
another interesting option, while further strategies
for treating patients with imatinib-resistant leukemia
are also currently under investigation. Some com-

pounds have been designed for combination with
imatinib, such as Raf kinase inhibitors, the farnesyl
transferase inhibitors lonafarnib (SCH66336), and
tipifarnib (R115777), mTOR, cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors,47 and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Aurora kinase inhibitors (eg, MK-0547) in Ph-negative
ALL with T315I mutations are also in development.
Clinical data from studies that are investigating the
use of these compounds are awaited with interest.
