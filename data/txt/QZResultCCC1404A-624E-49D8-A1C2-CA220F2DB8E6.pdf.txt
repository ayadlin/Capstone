Abstract
Integrins play a role in the resistance of advanced cancers to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this study, we
show that high expression of the a5 integrin subunit compromises temozolomide-induced tumor suppressor p53
activity in human glioblastoma cells. We found that depletion of the a5 integrin subunit increased p53 activity and
temozolomide sensitivity. However, when cells were treated with the p53 activator nutlin-3a, the protective effect
of a5 integrin on p53 activation and cell survival was lost. In a functional p53 background, nutlin-3a downregulated the a5 integrin subunit, thereby increasing the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide. Clinically, a5b1
integrin expression was associated with a more aggressive phenotype in brain tumors, and high a5 integrin gene
expression was associated with decreased survival of patients with high-grade glioma. Taken together, our
ﬁndings indicate that negative cross-talk between a5b1 integrin and p53 supports glioma resistance to
temozolomide, providing preclinical proof-of-concept that a5b1 integrin represents a therapeutic target for
high-grade brain tumors. Direct activation of p53 may remain a therapeutic option in the subset of patients with
high-grade gliomas that express both functional p53 and a high level of a5b1 integrin. Cancer Res; 72(14); 3463–70.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are the most aggressive
brain tumors and remain a challenge for oncologists. New
therapies are urgently needed. Gene expression proﬁling of
high-grade glioma revealed that genes of extracellular matrix
components and their regulators are often affected in the
patients. Fibronectin is overexpressed in glioblastoma versus
normal brain (1) and belongs to the cluster of genes associated
with a more malignant phenotype (2, 3). It has recently been
shown that ﬁbronectin knockdown delays tumor growth in a
mouse glioma model (4). The a5b1 integrin is a ﬁbronectin
receptor that was recently shown to have an important role in
tumor progression (5), metastasis (6), and/or resistance to
therapies (7) in lung, ovarian, and breast cancer, respectively.

Few works addressed directly the issue of a5b1 integrin in
glioma. Through the use of non-peptidic a5b1 integrin antagonists and GBM cell lines, we previously showed that a5b1
integrin may be a therapeutic target for these tumors (8, 9) and
that concomitant addition of a5b1 antagonists sensitizes p53
wild-type (p53-wt) glioma cells to chemotherapeutic drugs
(10). The presence of p53 mutations in high-grade glioma
varied across GBM subtypes with 0%, 21%, 32%, and 54% in
classical, neural, mesenchymal, and proneural subtypes,
respectively (11). There is increasing evidence that gliomas
harboring a p53-wt resist to therapies through inhibitory
pathways upstream of p53. Nutlin-3 belongs to the family of
small-molecule inhibitors of the MDM2–p53 interaction (12).
Nutlin-3 has been shown, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, to increase the degree of apoptosis in
hematologic malignancies (13). Recent studies extended its
therapeutic window for use in solid tumors (14, 15).
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a5b1
integrin in glioma resistance to temozolomide chemotherapy
using in vitro and in vivo models. We found that a high
expression of a5 subunit inhibited the temozolomide-induced
p53 pathway and that reactivation of p53 by nutlin-3a restores
the sensitivity to temozolomide by decreasing the expression
of the a5b1 integrin. Finally, we found that high a5 integrin
gene expression is associated with a more aggressive phenotype in brain tumors and a decrease in survival of patients. Our
results provide a clinical rationale for including a5b1 integrin–
targeted therapy in a subpopulation of patients with glioma.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Temozolomide was a kind gift from Schering-Plough.
Nutlin-3a, the active enantiomer of nutlin, was from Cayman.
Temozolomide was prepared before use at 10 mmol/L in 50/50
ethanol/H2O. Other drugs were prepared as stock solutions in
ethanol at 10 mmol/L and were kept at 20 C until use.
Cell culture and transfection
The U87MG cells (p53-wt) was from American Type Culture
Collection; the U373 cells (p53-mutated) from ECACC (Sigma)
and not authenticated in the laboratory. The LN18 (p53mutated) and LNZ308 [p53 knockout (KO)] cells were kindly
provided by M. Hegi (University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland). Cells were cultured as described elsewhere (10). The
identity of cell lines was regularly checked by morphologic
criteria, and importantly p53 status was routinely checked by
the yeast functional assay (16), Western blot quantiﬁcation of
p53 stability and phosphorylation, and by quantitative PCR
(qPCR) quantiﬁcation of p53 target genes after treatment with
ellipticine. Cells were stably transfected to overexpress (by
transfecting a pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the human
a5 integrin gene; provided by Dr. Ruoshlati, University of
California, Santa Barbara, CA) or to repress [by transfecting
a pSM2 plasmid coding for a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
targeting the a5 mRNA; Open Biosystems] the a5 integrin
subunit by using jetPRIME (Polyplus transfection) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. The vector for the p53-wt
transfection was a kind gift from Dr. C. Blattner (Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cells were
transfected with speciﬁc siRNA for human p53, the a5
integrin subunit, or nontargeting siRNA (Thermo Scientiﬁc
Dharmacon) with jetPRIME (Polyplus transfection) according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blot
Western blotting was carried out as previously described
(10). Antibodies used were against a5 integrin Ab1928 (Millipore) or H104 (Santa-Cruz), b1 integrin Ab1952, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Millipore,), p53
(BD Biosciences), or p53pser15 (Cell Signaling).
Flow cytometry
After detachment with EDTA, cells were incubated for 30
minutes at 4 C under agitation in the presence of primary
antibodies: anti-a5 integrin antibody IIA1 (BD Biosciences)
and anti-b1 integrin antibodies (TS2/16 from Santa Cruz; 9EG7
and mab13 from BD Biosciences). After washing, cells were
incubated for 30 minutes with secondary antibody (Alexa488conjugated goat anti-mouse or rat; Jackson ImmunoResearch).
After washing, cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and the mean ﬂuorescence
intensity characterizing surface expression of integrins was
measured using the CellQuest software.
Clonogenic assay
Clonogenic survival was determined as previously described
(9).

Immunoﬂuorescence
A total of 20,000 cells were seeded onto IBIDI m-dishes
coated with 10 mg/mL of poly-L-lysine. Cells were treated with
nutlin-3a (10 mmol/L) or with solvent during 24 hours before
ﬁxation with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 minutes at room
temperature) and then processed for a5 immunodetection
(IIA1 antibody; 1:300). Confocal images were taken with a
confocal microscope (BioRad 1024) equipped with a water
immersion 60 objective. Images were collected using the
Laser-Sharp 2000 software.
Human biopsies
This study was conducted on 115 adult brain biopsies,
95 brain tumors (22 grade II, 38 grade III, and 35 grade IV)
and 20 nontumoral brain tissues collected retrospectively from
archival material stored at the Centre de Ressources Biologiques et Tumorotheque (Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg,
Strasbourg, France). The patient characteristics have been
described elsewhere (17). Each sample was histologically analyzed by a pathologist to specify the tumor grade and the
percentage of tumor cells. Only samples with at least 50% of
tumoral cells (>50% of samples were >70% tumoral cells) have
been included in the study. Control tissues were obtained from
epileptic surgery. The study was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. Real-time qPCR was carried out as
described previously (17). The threshold cycle (Ct) values for
each gene were normalized to expression level of cyclophilin
used as the housekeeping gene. Values were normalized relatively to the value obtained for one nontumoral control brain
tissue, which was included in each qPCR run. Immunologic
analysis of a5 protein expression was conducted as shown
previously (17).
Human brain tumor data sets
Glioma gene expression data sets from 2 other cohorts were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; accession numbers GSE4271 and
GSE4412). Microarray raw data were processed using R (version 2.10.1; http://cran.r-project.org/), implemented with
the BioConductor package (http://www.bioconductor.org).
Estimates of the survival curves were computed using the
Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate survival comparisons
between the patients, according to low or high a5 integrin
expression levels, were conducted using a log-rank test.
Human brain tumor xenografts
TCG4, TCG9, and TCG17 glioma xenograft models were
obtained as previously described (18). Subcutaneous tumor
growth was followed by measuring, 3 times per week, 2
perpendicular diameters with a caliper. Treatments began
when tumors reached a volume of approximately 250 
50 mm3. Temozolomide was administered orally at the dose
of 50 mg/kg/d for 5 days. Mice were sacriﬁced when the
tumor volumes reached 4 times their initial volume (V0). For
each mouse, the time between the treatment onset and the
animal sacriﬁce was deﬁned as the "survival time." TP53
status of each xenograft was determined by the yeast functional assay (16).

a5b1 Integrin–p53 Axis in Glioma

Statistical analysis
Data are represented as the mean  SEM, and n is the
number of independent experiments. Statistical analyses were
conducted using the Student t test or the Mann–Whitney test
with the GraphPad Prism program. P < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
a5b1 integrin impedes temozolomide-induced p53-wt
activity
We compared the effect of temozolomide in U87MG cells
depleted in (shRNAa5) or overexpressing (pcDNAa5) a5 integrin versus control cells (shRNAns and pcDNActrl, respectively).
Because p53 is largely involved in chemotherapeutic drug
effects and we showed previously that a5b1 integrin antagonists modulate the p53 pathway (10), we focused on temozolomide-induced p53 activation. Temozolomide caused an
increase in p53 protein in all cell lines but not signiﬁcantly in
pcDNAa5 cells (when normalized to GAPDH: Fig. 1A). Interestingly, a signiﬁcant increase in p53 protein was already
observed in untreated shRNAa5 cells versus shRNActrl cells
(Fig. 1A). After temozolomide treatment, an increase in
p53pser15 was detectable in pcDNActrl and shRNAns cells, which
was signiﬁcantly more pronounced in shRNAa5 (Fig. 1A). In
contrast, in pcDNAa5 cells, signiﬁcantly less p53pser15 was
measured after temozolomide treatment. Transcriptional
activity of p53 was higher in shRNAa5 cells and lower in
pcDNAa5 cells than in temozolomide-treated control cells
(Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that a5b1
integrin modulates p53 activity and that high expression of
this integrin inhibits temozolomide-induced p53 stimulation.
Modulation of p53 activity was related to cell survival, as
pcDNAa5 cells are signiﬁcantly more resistant at high temozolomide concentration whereas shRNAa5 cells appear more
sensitive than their control counterparts (Fig. 1C). a5 integrin
overexpression did not modulate p53, nor clonogenic survival
in U373 and LN18 cells expressing a p53-mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, repression of a5 integrin in p53deﬁcient LNZ308 cells did not sensitize cells to temozolomide
(Supplementary Fig. S1). From these data, we concluded that
a5b1 integrin–induced temozolomide resistance requires a
functional p53.
As a ﬁrst approach to conﬁrm the role of the a5b1 integrin in
temozolomide chemoresistance in vivo, we used subcutaneous
xenografted human brain tumors in nude mice. We selected 3
xenografts that exhibited a wild-type p53 and different levels of
the a5 subunit. Kaplan–Meier analysis of the mouse survival
suggests a relationship between a5 integrin level and resistance to temozolomide (Fig. 1D), providing some evidence
for a role of the a5 integrin in the chemoresistance of p53-wt–
expressing tumors in vivo.
Activation of p53 by nutlin-3a overrides the a5 integrin
effects
We next investigated whether high a5 also impacts on
p53 activation by a non-genotoxic p53 activator in glioma
cells. U87MG cells were treated with nutlin-3a. In contrast

www.aacrjournals.org

to the effects of temozolomide, nutlin-3a stabilized p53,
markedly increased the p53pser15 and the transactivation of
p53 target genes in pcDNActrl and in pcDNAa5 cells (Fig. 2A
and B). Addition of temozolomide to nutlin-3a does not
further increase these effects (Fig. 2A). In clonogenic assays,
the a5b1 integrin did not efﬁciently protect the cells from
death when p53 was activated by 10 mmol/L nutlin-3a
(Fig. 2C). Survival of LNZ308 cells (p53 KO) or U373 cells
(p53-mutant) was less affected after treatment with nutlin3a (Fig. 2C).
Activation of p53 by nutlin-3a markedly decreases the a5
expression level in glioma cells
U87MG cells treated with nutlin-3a rounded up and
detached from the wells. This effect was lost when p53 expression was inhibited with speciﬁc siRNA (Fig. 3A, left). In
contrast, LNZ308 cells did not exhibit any morphologic alterations after a 10 mmol/L nutlin-3a treatment unless p53 was
reexpressed in the cells (Fig. 3A, right). Interestingly, cell
treatment with nutlin-3a decreased the expression of the a5
integrin at the protein level in U87MG-pcDNActrl and U87MGpcDNAa5 cells, an effect not observed after treatment with
temozolomide (Fig. 3B). The decrease in a5 protein expression
after nutlin-3a treatment was conﬁrmed by speciﬁc immunostaining of the a5 subunit in U87MG-pcDNActrl and U87MGpcDNAa5 cells and by ﬂow cytometric analysis of the a5
subunit at the cell membrane (Fig. 3B). A signiﬁcant decrease
in the a5 mRNA level was measured in U87MG pcDNActrl but
not in pcDNAa5 cells, suggesting that nutlin-3a affected the a5
subunit at translational and posttranslational levels (Fig. 3C).
Nutlin-3a also decreased b1 at the protein and mRNA level in
the U87MG cells, suggesting that both subunits of the a5b1
integrin are processed similarly after nutlin-3a treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2). However, no effect on the b1 subunit
expressed at the cell membrane could be detected after nutlin3a treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary
Table S1).
Nutlin-3a did not affect the endogenous a5 protein in p53knockout LNZ308 cells unless p53 was reexpressed (Fig. 3D).
Nutlin-3a had no effect on a5 expression in U373 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Altogether, these data suggest that nutlin3a requires a functional p53 to decrease a5 expression, which
in turn make the cells susceptible to the nutlin-3a–induced cell
death.
High a5b1 integrin expression is associated with worse
clinical outcome in high-grade glioma
To our knowledge, no studies have associated a5b1 integrin
with clinical outcome in patients with glioma. To investigate
ﬁrst whether integrin expression is associated with the grade of
brain tumors, gene expression of the a5 and b1 subunits were
examined by qPCR in 95 human brain tumors of different
grades and compared with 20 nontumor brain samples. The
data revealed that a5 subunit gene expression was increased
with increasing tumor grade, although the b1 subunit was
equally overexpressed in the 3 tumoral grades compared with
control tissue (Fig. 4A). Data were conﬁrmed at the protein
level (Fig. 4B). Because the a5 subunit only dimerizes with b1,

Discussion
The data summarized here document the impact of the
a5b1 integrin on the high-grade glioma resistance to temozolomide therapy. When the a5 integrin subunit is overexpressed, the p53-mediated responses to genotoxic damage are
compromised. When the a5 integrin level is low or suppressed,
p53 is stabilized and fully functional. An inverse relationship
between the a5 integrin level and p53 has been revealed
through the use of the p53 activator, nutlin-3a. These results

the data point toward a particular role for a5b1 integrin in
glioma.
We analyzed the clinical data of grade III and grade IV
patients. Log-rank analysis of the Kaplan–Meier survival
curves showed a signiﬁcant survival advantage for patients
with low a5-expressing glioma compared with high a5-expressing glioma. These results were validated in 2 independent
public data sets (2, 19). Considering all 3 cohorts together, the
group of high a5-expressing tumors included 39% of grade III
and 81% of grade IV tumors (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table S2).
Finally, we evaluated the relationship between a5 integrin level
and the status of p53 in 56 human biopsies (grade III and IV)
and in 17 human tumor xenografts. A clear tendency toward a
higher level of a5 in p53-wt versus p53-mutant tumors was
found in biopsies and in xenografts (Fig. 4D; Supplementary
Table S3).

may have clinical relevance in light of the clear advantage
reported here for prolonged survival of patients with highgrade glioma with low a5 integrin subunit expression.
In agreement with our data, it was reported that the a5b1
integrin is overexpressed at the protein level in a signiﬁcant
proportion of human glioblastoma biopsies (20). Here, we
show for the ﬁrst time that in glioma, the a5 mRNA level is
negatively correlated to survival in 3 different cohorts of
patients, which adds brain tumors to the growing list of
cancers in which the a5b1 integrin should be considered as
a therapeutic target. The role of p53 in temozolomide resistance is far from being understood. Although several groups
reported that p53 status is not predictive of response to
chemotherapy with alkylating agents (18, 21), more recent
works suggest that the absence of a functional p53 increases
temozolomide sensitivity in glioma cell lines (22) and in
intracranial glioblastoma xenografts (23). A trend toward an
increased temozolomide sensitivity in patients with p53 mutations was also suggested (24). We propose that overexpression
of the a5b1 integrin in GBM represents an alternative mechanism, aside from p53 deletion/mutation, to inactivate the
tumor-suppressive function of the p53 pathway. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the
integrin–p53 cross-talk by addressing the role of a5b1 integrin
in transcriptional and nontranscriptional effects of p53. Activation of the p53 pathway by nutlin-3a led to downregulation of

the a5 integrin subunit in glioma cells. On the basis of our data,
there seems to be a cross-antagonistic interaction between the
a5 integrin and p53 that was only revealed by nutlin-3a, which
may explain why this drug overcomes the prosurvival activity
of the integrin. Our results are similar to recent data showing
that nutlin-3a downregulates the oncogene DEK or overcomes

apoptosis (25, 26).
In summary, we have shown for the ﬁrst time that a5b1
integrin plays a critical role in resistance to temozolomide
therapy by interfering with the p53 pathway in high-grade
glioma. In addition, we have shown that activation of p53 by

Figure 4. Elevated a5-integrin gene expression is associated with high-grade glioma and predicts decreased survival rates. A, gene expression levels of a5
and b1 integrin subunits were quantiﬁed with speciﬁc primers by qPCR in 20 nontumor brain tissues (G0), 22 grade 2 (GII), 38 grade 3 (GIII), and 35 glioblastoma
(GIV) samples. Only the a5 integrin subunit level is associated with the tumor grade.  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001 as compared with nontumoral
brain tissue (Mann–Whitney test). B, immunohistochemical analysis of a5 protein in tumoral cells of human high-grade glioma. Representative slides of
a5 high intensity staining in GBM (i), a5-negative staining in GBM (ii), a5 high intensity staining in grade III tumor (iii), and a5-negative staining in grade III tumors
(iv). Scale bars, 50mm. C, elevated a5 integrin gene expression is associated with signiﬁcantly decreased long-term survival in patients with high-grade glioma.
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of 3 patient cohorts is shown. Left, cohort from this study; middle, data from Freije and colleagues (2); right, data from
Phillips and colleagues (19). D, the a5 mRNA expression level and p53 status in human brain tumor xenografts in nude mice. Ten xenografts expressed
a wild-type p53 and 7 xenografts had a mutant p53, as determined by the FASAY assay. The a5 mRNA levels were determined in at least 3 different grafts of the
same tumor, and the mean levels were plotted according to p53 status. The mean values  SEM of the a5 mRNA level in p53-wt and mutant p53 tumors were
8.9  3.6 and 4.1  1.3, respectively. Although not signiﬁcant, this difference shows a trend toward an increased level of a5 in p53-wt tumors.

nutlin-3a represses the a5b1 integrin, and we propose that
such downregulation is an important mediator of nutlin-3a
cytotoxic activity. The relevance of our results is emphasized by
the ﬁnding that a5 integrin gene overexpression is associated
with decreased survival in patients with high-grade glioma.
Our data provide the rationale for a preclinical evaluation of
p53 activators and/or a5b1 integrin antagonists in a subset of
high-grade glioma that expresses a functional p53 and high
levels of a5b1 integrin.
