he incidence of invasive candidiasis caused by azole-resistant
Candida species has increased in the U.S. over the past 10 years.1
Candidemia is the fourth leading cause of blood stream infection and
disproportionately affects those with serious illnesses, such as hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, those who have received an
organ transplant, and those who require intensive care unit management.2,3 With an estimated crude mortality rate of 40% in some studies,4,5 invasive candidiasis is a significant problem. The management
of this infection has been complicated by the emergence of infection
with Candida species that are resistant to the most commonly used
agent for initial treatment, fluconazole. In this issue of Cancer,
Hachem et al.6 seek to further define the incidence of infection with
fluconazole-resistant Candida species in a cancer hospital and document risk factors for infection with these organisms.
The study by Hachem et al. is an extension of a surveillance study
that occurred from 1988 to 1992 at the University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center7 and, as such, reflects the current practices of
prophylaxis and management of fungal infections in patients who
have hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In the prior study,
there was a decrease in the incidence of invasive C. albicans infections
beginning in 1990, after fluconazole prophylaxis became commonplace for patients with leukemia. From 1990 to 1992, the rate of infection with C. glabrata remained relatively constant, but the rate of
invasive C. krusei infection increased to 7%.7 In their current study,
which encompasses 1993 to 2003, Hachem et al. report a continuation
of this trend, demonstrating dramatic increases in the rates of C. krusei infection (from 7% to 24%) and C. glabrata infection (from 12% to
31%) in patients with hematologic malignancies. C. albicans accounted
for only 14% of all candidemias in this population in their study.
It is interesting to note that patients with solid tumors who did
not receive fluconazole prophylaxis routinely had significantly lower

rates of candidemia with C. glabrata and C. krusei
compared with patients who had hematologic malignancies. C. albicans accounted for 45% of the candidemias, and C. glabrata and C. krusei accounted for
only 18% and 2%, respectively; these rates are similar
to those noted in tertiary care general hospitals.
It is important to interpret these findings in the
context in which they occurred. Experience in a cancer hospital likely does not apply to the experience
of other hospitals. In the U.S., the overall incidence
of candidemia varies widely, depending on the location, from 6 up to 24 cases per 100,000 population
per year.8 Geographic differences exist throughout
the world, with a low incidence of candidemia
reported from many medical centers in Europe and
Central America.8 These differences extend to the
isolation of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata and C.
krusei. The Artemis Surveillance Program, a worldwide surveillance network, has demonstrated only
small increases in C. glabrata isolates, from 11% in
1997 to 12% in 2003.9 Similarly, C. krusei increased
from 1.7% to 2.7% over the same period. These data
obviously differ greatly from the experience at M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center.
Hachem et al. observed that fluconazole prophylaxis was associated with C. glabrata and C. krusei infections and that the absence of fluconazole
prophylaxis was associated with C. albicans infections. Marr et al. from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Center reported similar findings in bone marrow
transplantation recipients who received fluconazole
prophylaxis.10 It should be emphasized that the
experiences in tertiary care general hospital settings
differ from the experiences in cancer hospitals with
regard to the epidemiology of candidemia. For
example, during a period similar to that of the study
by Hachem et al., Lin et al. at the University of
Chicago observed no association of fungemia with
C. krusei or C. glabrata with fluconazole exposure,11
and Malani et al. did not identify fluconazole prophylaxis as a risk factor for C. glabrata fungemia at
our institution.12 Furthermore, in European countries where fluconazole use also has increased, no
increase in the incidence of C. glabrata infection
has been observed.8 In both Iowa and Michigan, an
increase in C. glabrata candidemia was associated
strongly with advancing age.12,13 Therefore, it is
likely that there are multiple factors, including geography, age, antifungal exposure, and underlying
disease state, that are important in the observed
increase of infections with non-albicans Candida
species.
The importance of the study by Hachem et al. is
the demonstration of high rates of invasive infections

2335

with non-albicans Candida species in patients
with hematologic malignancies, emphasizing the
value of ongoing surveillance within individual
institutions. It is vital to have knowledge of local
epidemiologic trends when selecting initial therapy for Candida bloodstream infections. It usually
takes days for Candida to be identified to the species level and longer for an assessment of antifungal
susceptibility. In an institution that has high rates of
infection from fluconazole-resistant Candida species,
an echinocandin or an amphotericin B formulation
should be the initial treatment of choice. The echinocandins are considered equivalent to amphotericin B
and fluconazole for candidemia.14,15 In institutions
that have lower rates of infection with C. glabrata and
C. krusei, fluconazole remains appropriate as initial
therapy for patients who are not critically ill and do
not have specific risk factors for the acquisition of fluconazole-resistant Candida species.16
There are 2 major issues with regard to the data
presented and the conclusions that were reached in
the study by Hachem et al. First, they stated that
their antifungal susceptibility studies are ‘‘in strict
accordance with recommendations from the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute,’’ yet no data are
presented regarding susceptibilities. It would
be extremely important to know how many of the
C. glabrata isolates were resistant to fluconazole and
how many fell in the dose-dependent susceptible or
susceptible range. Equally important are susceptibilities of this species to voriconazole and posaconazole, especially in light of increasing use of both of
these agents among patients with hematologic
malignancies and increasing reports of cross-resistance among all triazoles.17,18
Second, the conclusions regarding outcomes
drawn by Hachem et al. in their discussion need to
be interpreted with caution. Although there are
details listed regarding how outcomes were evaluated for these 635 patients, no specific data are
reported with the exception of the last line in Table
2, which is headed ‘‘Clinical and microbiologic
response to antifungals.’’ Furthermore, there is no
in-depth analysis of outcomes in their Results section. Data on the specifics of how patients were
managed with regard to choice of antifungal agent,
duration of therapy, and removal of central venous
catheters are not presented. Despite these findings,
the abstract states that response to antifungal therapy was worse in patients who had hematologic
malignancies compared with patients who had
solid tumors. It would be interesting to have an
evaluation of the effects of isolating C. glabrata and
C. krusei from blood cultures with regard to out-

comes. We still are left wondering about the clinical
implications of the epidemiologic observation that
these 2 species are increasing in frequency. We
hope that this is a topic for a subsequent report
from this group.
Finally, Hachem et al. raise the question of how
to prevent candidemia, especially that caused by azole-resistant species, in high-risk populations. Two
studies that were published last year demonstrated
the benefit of the extended-spectrum triazole posaconazole in preventing invasive infections with both
Candida and moulds in high-risk patients with
chemotherapy-associated neutropenia subsequent to
treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome19 and stem cell transplantation
recipients who had graft-versus-host disease.20 In
both of those studies, the incidence of breakthrough
invasive candidiasis among all groups was extremely
low, 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively, and was predominantly C. glabrata or C. krusei. Another multicenter,
randomized study comparing fluconazole with voriconazole for prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell
transplantation recipients indicated that there was
no difference in invasive fungal infections and very
low rates of candidemia in each group.21 The impact
that the use of prophylactic antifungal agents, such
as posaconazole and voriconazole, will have on the
epidemiology of invasive candidiasis over time
remains unclear. Not all patients may benefit from
such therapy because of poor oral absorption of
posaconazole, the myriad drug interactions with voriconazole, and the risk of hepatotoxicity, which can
occur with both drugs.
The epidemiology of invasive Candida infections in high-risk cancer patients needs to be revisited frequently, particularly at institutions in which
azole-resistant Candida species seem to be increasing, to provide guidance for the physicians who
care for these patients. Correct initial treatment in
patients with candidemia is a crucial factor for a
successful outcome.22,23 The selection of initial
treatment should be based on factors that include
prior antifungal exposure, the clinical status of the
patient, and the epidemiology of candidemia at
individual institutions. It is hoped that the group at
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center will continue to
share their experiences to help define the epidemiology of invasive Candida infections among cancer
patients.
