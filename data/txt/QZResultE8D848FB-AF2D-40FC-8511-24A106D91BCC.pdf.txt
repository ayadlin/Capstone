BACKGROUND: There has not been a comprehensive analysis of how aggregate cancer costs have changed over
time. The authors present 1) updated estimates of the prevalence and total cost of cancer for select payers and how
these have changed over the past 2 decades; and 2) for each payer, the distribution of payments by type of service
over time to assess whether there have been shifts in cancer treatment settings. METHODS: Pooled data from the
2001 through 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the 1987 National Medical Care Expenditure Survey were
used for the analysis. The authors used an econometric approach to estimate cancer-attributable medical expenditures by payer and type of service. RESULTS: In 1987, the total medical cost of cancer (in 2007 US dollars) was $24.7
billion. Private payers financed the largest share of the total (42%), followed by Medicare (33%), out of pocket (17%),
other public (7%), and Medicaid (1%). Between 1987 and the 2001 to 2005 period, the total medical cost of cancer
increased to $48.1 billion. In 2001 to 2005, the shares of cancer costs were: private insurance (50%), Medicare (34%),
out of pocket (8%), other public (5%), and Medicaid (3%). The share of total cancer costs that resulted from inpatient
admissions fell from 64.4% in 1987 to 27.5% in 2001 to 2005. CONCLUSIONS: The authors identified 3 trends in the
total costs of cancer: 1) the medical costs of cancer have nearly doubled; 2) cancer costs have shifted away from the
inpatient setting; and 3) the share of these costs paid for by private insurance and Medicaid have increased. Cancer

A solid understanding of trends in the level and composition of spending on cancer, in conjunction with data on outcomes, is important for evaluating whether we are spending our healthcare resources wisely and for prioritizing future
resources for treating and preventing cancer. Total spending on cancer and the composition of spending is likely to vary
over time for several reasons. First, over the past several decades, cancer-related incidence and prevalence has changed significantly. Whereas the annual percentage increase in cancer incidence was 1.2% per year in the late 1970s and 1980s,
incidence decreased by roughly 1.7% per year during 2001 to 2005.1 Furthermore, prevalence, defined as the number or
persons previously diagnosed with cancer, has increased over time. In 2004, >10 million Americans were living with cancer, including roughly 1.4 million who were diagnosed within the past 12 months.2 Because of population growth and the
aging of the US population, the absolute number of persons with cancer will likely continue to increase in the future.
Second, mortality from cancer, the second leading cause of death in the United States,2 has changed over time. Cancer-related deaths increased at an annual rate of 0.5% in the 15 years before 1990, whereas the 2002 to 2005 period
showed an annual decline of 1.8%.1 Mortality is important from the standpoint of spending because a large proportion of
healthcare costs are concentrated in the months before death. Trends in cancer death rates reflect trends in incidence rates,
improvements in the effectiveness of early detection and treatment, and increases in longevity because of reductions in
mortality from competing risks such as heart disease.

Third, improvements in cancer detection and treatment effectiveness (such as those seen in the treatment of
breast cancer) are also partly responsible for changes in
cancer spending.3 Fourth, trends in spending by payer
type are affected by shifts in eligibility for and the benefit
design of public insurance programs and employer-sponsored health insurance.
All of these factors are likely to have influenced the
economic burden that cancer imposes on the US healthcare system. Although a few studies have quantified cancer
costs for specific payers,4-7 there has not been a comprehensive analysis of how aggregate cancer costs have
changed over time, and who now bears the burden of financing the bulk of these costs. This information is important for enhancing our understanding of the burden of
cancer on specific payers, for budgeting purposes, for setting research and program priorities, and for use in costeffectiveness analyses. The objective of our analysis was to
use nationally representative data that span 2 decades to:
• Present updated estimates of the prevalence and total cost
of cancer for select payers (Medicare, Medicaid, other
public, private, out of pocket) and how these have
changed over the past 2 decades.
• For each payer, present the distribution of payments over
time by type of service (inpatient, prescription, outpatient/physician, and other) to assess whether there have
been shifts in the settings in which cancer is treated.

Our results provide comprehensive estimates of the
aggregate costs of cancer by payer and type of service
within payer and how these costs have changed over time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
We used data from the 2001 through 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and its predecessor, the
National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES), a 1-time
survey conducted in 1987. Both surveys are nationally
representative and capture self-reported data on medical
conditions and related expenditures by type (eg, those
related to prescription drugs) and source of payment (eg,
Medicaid, private, self) for the US civilian noninstitutionalized population. Neither NMES nor MEPS include
spending related to residents of long-term care facilities.
Details of the surveys have been published previously.8
The costs captured by MEPS represent payments (not
charges) from the payer to the provider. These are
obtained through a combination of self-report (household

3478

component) and follow-back surveys with providers
(medical provider component). NMES costs represent
charges; we adjusted charges in NMES to be consistent
with the payments in MEPS using methods developed by
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.9 Furthermore, both NMES and MEPS expenditures were
inflated to 2007 US dollars using the annual gross domestic product price index.10
We identified medical conditions in MEPS and
NMES based on similar questions in both surveys that ask
participants to self-report conditions that required medical
treatment at some point during the interview year. Medical
conditions are not validated with provider reports from the
medical provider component.11 Trained coders then classified self-reported medical conditions using International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Although NMES coded the selfreported conditions into more detailed 4-digit ICD-9
codes, we used only the first 3 digits for the medical conditions, to ensure consistency with MEPS. The MEPS and
NMES samples included 135,714 individuals and 28,639
individuals, respectively; weighting variables were used to
generate nationally representative estimates.
Methods
We used econometric methods to estimate cancer-attributable medical expenditures by payer (Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers, other public payers, and out of
pocket) and type of service (inpatient, outpatient/officebased, prescription, and other). The ‘‘other’’ category
included costs related to emergency room visits, home
healthcare, vision aids, and other medical supplies. The
econometric approach predicts medical expenditures at
the individual level as a function of the presence or
absence of cancer, other costly or prevalent medical conditions, and sociodemographic characteristics. We ran separate analyses for total medical expenditures by source of
payer and type of service. In each model, the dependent
variable was defined as annual expenditures for a given
payer/service. The estimation sample for each payer population included all individuals who reported coverage by
the payer or with a payment from that source.
As is typical with medical expenditure data, the samples included many individuals with zero expenditures
during the year for some points of service and some individuals with extremely high expenditures. Therefore, we
predicted annual expenditures for each survey using a 2part model. The first part of the model used logistic
regression to predict the probability of any medical

expenditure for the payer/service. The second part of the
model predicted expenditures only for those people who
actually have positive expenditures. To select the appropriate cost estimation model for the second part of the 2part model, we used the algorithm recommended by
Manning and Mullahy for choosing among alternative
nonlinear estimators.12 The algorithm indicated that we
should use a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and a log link. We multiplied the predicted
probability from the first stage of the model with predicted (conditional) expenditures from the second stage
to generate predicted annual medical expenditures for
each individual in the database as a function of his or her
disease profile and demographics.
Each part of the model included the same set of independent variables. The primary variable of interest was
an indicator for cancer type (colorectal, lung, breast, prostate, skin, cervical, and other). Additional independent
variables included the following high-cost or highly prevalent medical conditions: heart disease, stroke, congestive
heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, injuries, dyslipidemia, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, pneumonia, asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, other mental
health/substance abuse, arthritis, back problems, skin disorders, renal failure, and pregnancy. All regressions also
included as independent variables the following demographic characteristics: age, age squared, sex, race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, Asian, other), education
(missing degree, younger than 16 years, no degree, high
school diploma, college degree, graduate degree, other
degree such as an associate degree), family income
(<100%, 100% to 199%, 200% to 399%, 400% of the
poverty line), and, for the MEPS analyses, year indicators.
All analyses were conducted using Stata software, version
10 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex).
We used the estimates from the econometric models
to quantify cancer-attributable medical expenditures for
each payer/service. Typically, disease-attributable expenditures are calculated by predicting expenditures using
observed diseases and subtracting from that predicted
expenditures, setting the disease of interest (ie, cancer) to
zero and leaving all other covariates and diseases as they
are in the data. However, we have shown in previous work
that in nonlinear models, such as that used here, this
approach will lead to double counting of expenditures for
co-occurring diseases, regardless of whether 1 disease
causes the other.13 Double counting of expenditures is a
particular problem in cases where >1 condition is treated
Cancer

during a single office visit or hospitalization. We used a
technique, termed complete classification and described
in an earlier study, to ensure no double counting occurs.13
Specifically, using the parameters of the econometric
model, we treated each disease and combination of diseases observed in the data as its own separate entity when
calculating attributable costs. For example, cancer alone
and cancer with heart disease would be treated as 2 different diseases in the attributable expenditure calculation
described above. We then divided the total expenditures
attributable to the combinations of diseases back to the
constituent diseases using the parameters from the model
to construct shares for each constituent disease within a
combination (ie, a share of all cancer with heart disease
costs that are attributable to cancer). The shares attribute
a greater share of the joint expenditures to the disease with
the larger coefficient in the main effect. The formula to
construct the shares is given in Trogdon et al. 13
We break down the change in total cancer costs in
the following way. Let P05 (P87) and $05 ($87) be the
number of prevalence cancer cases and the average cost
per person with cancer in MEPS (NMES). Then, for each
payer, the change in cancer costs is
P05  $05  P87  $87 ¼ ðP05  $05  P87  $05Þ
þ ðP87  $05  P87  $87Þ:

ðEq: 1Þ

The first term after the equal sign shows the change
because of prevalence; it compares cancer costs using prevalent cancer cases from the 2 periods holding cost per person
with cancer constant. The second term shows the change in
cancer costs because of cost per person with cancer.

RESULTS
The prevalence of cancer cases increased among all payer
populations between 1987 and the 2001 to 2005 period
(Table 1). This, combined with an increase in the number
of enrollees for all payers except ‘‘other’’ payers, led to substantial increases in the number of cancer cases, ranging
from an 81.1% increase in the number of cases for patients
covered by other public payers to a 250.8% increase in the
number of cases for those covered by Medicaid.
In 1987, the total medical cost of cancer (realexpressed in 2007 US dollars) was $24.7 billion (Table 2).
Private payers financed the largest share of the total
(42%), followed by Medicare (33%), patients paying out
of pocket (17%), other public payers (7%), and Medicaid
(1%) (Fig. 1). Between 1987 and the 2001 to 2005 period, the total (real) medical cost of cancer increased by

Cancer costs in MEPS are average annual costs over the years 2001 through 2005. ‘‘Other noninpatient’’ included costs related to emergency room visits,
home healthcare, vision aids, and other medical supplies. Cancer-attributable expenditures are calculated as the difference between expenditures for persons
with cancer and persons without cancer, adjusted for sociodemographics and comorbidities. Negative costs indicate that adjusted expenditures were lower
for persons with cancer for that payer and type of service.

98%, to $48.1 billion. However, as a share of overall medical expenditures, cancer costs remained relatively constant (4.8% of $513 billion in total medical expenditures
in 1987 and 4.9% of $979 billion during 2001 to 2005).
Thus, the increase in cancer costs matched the overall
increase in medical expenditures during the last 20 years.
However, the increase in cancer expenditures varied
substantially across payers. In real terms, Medicaid costs
increased by 488% ($1.3 billion), costs to private insurers
increased by 137% ($13.8 billion), and Medicare costs increased by 99% ($8.1 billion). Costs paid by other public
programs increased by a much smaller amount: 25%
($459 million). Costs paid out of pocket, which include
copayments and deductibles plus costs for the uninsured,
fell by 7% ($288 million). As with changes across payers,
the increases in cancer costs within payer also tended to
match the increase in overall payer expenditures; cancer
costs as a share of total payer expenditures were generally
stable (eg, 5.3% of private insurance expenditures were attributable to cancer in 1987 and 5.7% in the 2001 to
2005 period).
As a result of the changes described in the preceding
paragraph, the distribution of cancer-related costs across
payers has shifted (Fig. 2). The share of cancer costs paid
by private insurance increased from 42% to 50%, whereas
the share of out-of-pocket costs fell from 17% to 8%;
other payers’ share fell from 7% to 5%. Even with an
aging population, the share of cancer costs paid for by
Medicare remained fairly constant over this time period

(33% vs 34%). The share of cancer costs paid by Medicaid
remained low but tripled from 1% to 3%.
As with other medical services, another major trend
that occurred over this time period was a movement away
from cancer treatment in the inpatient setting. Across
payers, the share of cancer costs that resulted from inpatient admissions fell from 64.4% of total cancer costs in
1987 to 27.5% during the 2001 to 2005 period. This shift
occurred within every payer, although to differing degrees.
In real terms, total inpatient expenditures dropped from
$15.9 billion to $13.2 billion over this time period.
As shown in Table 3, the reduction in the percentage
of expenditures resulting from inpatient cancer treatment
can be explained in part by a decrease in the percentage of
cancer patients admitted to hospital for care and decreased
average length of hospital stay. The probability of receiving inpatient cancer treatment in the past year among
those with a positive cancer diagnosis decreased for every
payer between 1987 and the 2001 to 2005 period, ranging
from a 34% decrease for Medicaid (from 40.7% to 26.9%
of cancer patients) to a 56% decrease for out-of-pocket
payers, including the uninsured (from 22.7% to 9.9%).
However, among patients who were admitted, average
length of stay was relatively stable.
For every type of payer, the decrease in cancerrelated inpatient expenditures has been accompanied by
an increase in cancer-attributable outpatient expenditures
(Table 2). Some payers also experienced an increase in
cancer-attributable prescription drug expenditures. In
both time periods, prescription drug expenditures

administered outside of the inpatient setting accounted
for a low percentage of all cancer-attributable costs paid
by Medicare and other public payers. Cancer-attributable
spending for prescription drugs increased for patients
with private insurance (from 1.4% to 7.0%) and for outof-pocket payers (from 5.2% to 27.7%) across the 2 time
periods. Across all payers, prescriptions accounted for
6.1% of all cancer-attributable medical expenditures in
the 2001 to 2005 period, up from 1.8% in 1987.
For Medicaid and private insurance, 86% and 84%
of the overall increase in costs was because of the change
in prevalence (see Eq. 1). For Medicare and other public
insurance, the change because of cost per person was
actually negative (ie, if the number of cases had remained
the same, the costs of cancer would have decreased), indicating that the increase in prevalence more than made up
for a decrease in costs per person. Out of pocket was the
only insurance group in which the change in cancer costs
(a net decrease between NMES and MEPS) was mainly
driven by changes in costs per person; costs per person
decreased by enough to offset an increase in the number
of prevalence cases.

DISCUSSION
The results of this study reveal 3 important trends in the
costs of cancer over the past 20 years: 1) the total medical
costs of cancer have nearly doubled, although this increase
is not dissimilar to overall trends in aggregate health

3482

spending; 2) as with general medical services, cancerrelated treatment costs have shifted away from the inpatient setting and toward the outpatient setting; and 3) the
share of these costs paid for by private insurance and Medicaid has increased.
Cancer-specific medical expenditures have doubled
in the past 20 years. Comparing the results from Tables 1
and 2, the number of cancer cases has increased proportionately more than medical expenditures, indicating that
the increase in cancer costs has been driven mainly by the
increase in the number of cases and not by the cost per
treated cancer case. The dramatic increase in the number
of cancer cases is because of new cases diagnosed among
the aging population base, as well as increasing cancer
prevalence. Despite a downward trend in overall cancer
incidence, cancer prevalence has increased because of
more cancers occurring in an aging population and, for
some cancers, improved treatments leading to improved
survival rates.1,3
The upward pressure on cancer costs caused by the
increase in the number of people living with cancer has
been offset somewhat by a slight decrease in the average
medical expenditures per patient. This is the result of the
shift away from inpatient treatment toward the outpatient
setting, as seen in Table 2 and in previous studies.14,15 For
example, many cancer patients now receive chemotherapy
and radiation therapy in the outpatient clinic setting.16
Advances in medicine and technology, changing demographics, and legislation have contributed to this shift.15
Other factors driving the change are cost-containment
strategies implemented by payers, limited inpatient support resources, improved outpatient supportive care, and
patient preference for shorter hospital stays.14 All told,
these shifts did not outweigh the increases in costs caused
by increased cancer prevalence over the past 20 years. The
combination of the upward trend in prevalent cancer cases
with changes in treatment settings resulted in cancer costs
increasing at the same rate as overall medical expenditures.
Over the past 20 years, nearly 5% of all medical spending
in the United States has gone to the care of cancer patients
(Table 2).
Whereas the share of medical expenditures going to
cancer has remained constant, the burden to payers has
changed. Private insurance, which was already paying for
the largest share of cancer costs in 1987, has seen its share
of the cancer costs burden increase to half of all cancer-attributable medical expenditures. Despite a decrease in the
price of private insurance,17 population increases have led
to an increase in the total number of the privately insured

(Table 1). As cancer screening rates in the pre-Medicare
population continue to increase, cancer-attributable costs
to private payers will likely continue to rise. Because early
detection has shifted an increased proportion of the burden to private payers, we can expect that private payers
will take a stronger interest in the quality and costs of
cancer care.
Because of the relatively young population served by
Medicaid, its share of cancer costs is small, but Medicaid
experienced the largest relative increase. This is because of
the dramatic increase in the number of cancer patients
covered by Medicaid and an increase in expenditures per
treated patient (results not shown). The latter effect is
likely the result of Medicaid paying for cancers detected at
later stages and/or cancer patients with comorbidities who
need inpatient care.18
Our analysis extends previous estimates of the medical cost of cancer in 2 ways. First, we present estimates for
all payers and use more recent data than were available in
previous studies.6,7 One of those studies reported that
cancer spending accounted for 5.4% of all medical expenditures among the nonelderly in the 1996 to 1999 MEPS,
which concurs with our finding of relatively stable cancer
spending as a percentage of overall medical spending.7
Second, we presented trends in spending by payer and
type of service over the last 20 years. Similar figures have
been reported from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database for 1991
through 20024; our study reports cancer costs for other
payers in addition to Medicare.5
Although the NMES and MEPS data allowed us to
assess the trends in the cost of cancer over the past 20
years, these data sources also have limitations. First, they
capture only a fraction of total national health expenditures. For example, both exclude spending related to residents of long-term care facilities.19 In the authors’ analysis
of the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey, cancer
patients were not over-represented in nursing homes.
However, estimates reported here do not include nursing
home expenditures attributable to cancer. In general, differences in the relative proportion of different cancer types
over time as well as changes in medical practice patterns
will influence overall treatment patterns and related costs.
Analysis of more specific cancer sites (eg, breast or colorectal cancer) was not possible because of small sample
sizes. In addition, medical conditions in NMES and
MEPS are self-reported and not verified by chart review.
Johnson and Sanchez11 compared self-reported conditions by households to the reports of their medical pro-

viders in NMES. Defining agreement as a match between
any condition listed as a reason for a medical event by the
household and any disease listed by the medical provider
for the same event, the rate of agreement for neoplasms
was 43% at the 3-digit ICD-9 level and 55% at higher levels of groupings. The limitations of the self-reported data
must be balanced against the benefits provided by
NMES/MEPS relative to SEER-Medicare, namely that
nationally representative cost-of-illness estimates can be
estimated for the non-Medicare population and payers.
Although self-reporting can be problematic for some types
of conditions, in general the literature supports the validity of this approach.20,21 Cancer patients with advanced
disease may be unlikely to participate in either of these
surveys, further contributing to underestimation of cancer
costs. Finally, the true burden of cancer includes nonmedical costs for travel and child care, costs incurred by
caretakers, and nontangible costs associated with psychological pain and stress, as well as lost productivity.22,23
Although medical costs are often the sole focus of economic research and debate, a full accounting of the cost
and benefits of policy changes affecting cancer patients
should take such nonmedical costs into consideration.
The future of cancer detection and treatment is certain to involve changes that affect not only cancer-related
medical expenditures but also which payers are responsible for those expenditures. Out-of-pocket expenditures
associated with cancer treatment are likely to increase
because of increases in the cost of cancer-treatment procedures and drugs24 and the trend toward consumer-driven
healthcare options, such as Health Savings Accounts and
High-Deductible Health Plans, which require greater levels of consumer cost-sharing.25 Conversely, proposed
healthcare reform measures would offer health insurance
coverage to those who are currently uninsured, which
would shift cancer expenditures further to private insurance or to public payers, depending on how the coverage
is extended. Unless significant reductions in reimbursement rates are negotiated, a public option will likely
increase the costs to public health insurance plans as the
number of persons covered by the government increases.
Policy changes to public programs are also likely to shift
the burden of cancer spending. For example, the National
Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program and
the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment
Act have been expanded to provide an additional route for
women with breast and cervical cancer to gain Medicaid
eligibility.26 The information provided in this study
enhances our understanding of the burden of cancer on

specific payers and how this burden may change as a result
of healthcare reform measures or other changes to healthcare financing and delivery. Further research will be
needed to determine the impact of these and other
changes on costs and quality of cancer care in the United
States.
