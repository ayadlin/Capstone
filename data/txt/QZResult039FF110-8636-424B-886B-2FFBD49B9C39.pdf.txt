ABSTRACT
Targeted cancer therapy using small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) has been useful
in targeting the tumor cells while sparing the normal cells. Despite clinical success
of many targeted therapies, their off-target effects and development of resistance
are emerging as significant and challenging problems. Thus, there is an urgent need
to identify targets to devise new means to treat cancers and their drug-resistant
phenotypes. CARP-1/CCAR1 (Cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator 1), a
peri-nuclear phospho-protein, plays a dynamic role in regulating cell growth and
apoptosis by serving as a co-activator of steroid/thyroid nuclear receptors, β-catenin,
Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ligase, and tumor suppressor
p53. CARP-1/CCAR1 also regulates chemotherapy-dependent apoptosis. CARP-1/
CCAR1 functional mimetics (CFMs) are a novel SMIs of CARP-1/CCAR1 interaction with
APC/C. CFMs promote apoptosis in a manner independent of p53. CFMs are potent
inhibitors of a variety of cancer cells including the drug (Adriamycin or Tamoxifen)resistant breast cancer cells but not the immortalized breast epithelial cells, while a
nano-lipid formulation of the lead compound CFM-4 improves its bioavailability and
efficacy in vivo when administered orally. This review focuses on the background and
pleiotropic roles of CARP-1/CCAR1 as well as its apoptosis signaling mechanisms in
response to chemotherapy in cancer cells.

full understanding of the molecular complexity of cancers
is yet to be realized, considerable progress have been
made in the treatment of a range of cancers that include
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL), Hodgkin’s lymphoma and testicular
cancers [2]. Unfortunately, the successful outcome of
many anti-cancer treatments and disease-free survival
of the patients is often short lived due in part to limiting
toxic side effects of therapies as well as emergence
of drug-resistant cancers. Therefore, it is necessary
to discover new targets and molecular pathways that
regulate processes of carcinogenesis in order to improve
diagnoses and therapeutic efficacy of current drugs as well
as to permit design and development of novel therapeutic
strategies to effectively combat cancers including their
drug-resistant variants.

INTRODUCTION
According to “World Cancer Report 2014” by WHO,
in 2012 about 14.1 million new cases of cancer occurred
globally and caused 14.6% of all human deaths [1]. It is
expected that annual cancer cases will rise from 14.1 to
22 million within the next two decades [1]. Disturbingly,
cancer remains the second most common cause of death
among children between the ages of 1 to 14 years in the
US [1]. Over the past years, with the help of well adapted
genomic and proteomic technologies, researchers have
made strides in better understanding the biochemical and
molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Conventional
radio and chemo therapies, coupled with newer targeted
cancer therapy are currently utilized for management and
treatment of a variety of cancers in the clinic. Although a

Discovery of CARP-1/CCAR1

In 2008, Kim et al. reported that CARP-1/CCAR1
functions as co-activator of NRs. CARP-1/CCAR1
associates with components of Mediator and p160
co-activator complexes and is recruited to endogenous
NR target genes in the presence of appropriate hormone.
CARP-1/CCAR1 interacts with and co-operates with
CoCoA and GRIP1 co-activators for estrogen receptor
(ER) signaling, and promotes growth of MCF-7 HBC
cells in response to estradiol (E2) treatment [10]. CARP1/CCAR1 also physically and functionally associated
with mediator complex including NUT2/MED10 and
MED23 [11]. CCAR1/CARP-1 stimulated the basal and
hormone dependent activities of glucocorticoid (GR)
and thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TR) reporter genes in
CV-1 cells [10]. Besides co-activation of GR, CARP-1/
CCAR1 also positively regulated adipogenesis through
GR signaling pathway [11]. A recent investigation
also revealed that carboxyl terminal region of the
transcription factor GATA1 interacts with CARP-1/
CCAR1, CoCoA, and MED1. CARP-1/CCAR1 and
CoCoA in fact synergistically enhanced GATA1mediated transcription from the γ-globin promoter during
erythroid differentiation [12].
Additionally, CARP-1/CCAR1 binds directly with
ER and associates with p160 coactivators and in turn recruits
mediator MED1/TRAP220 (Thyroid hormone receptor
associated Protein 220) to ER target gene pS2 in E2-dependent
manner. A recent investigation emphasized that CARP-1/
CCAR1 is required for growth of prostate cancer cells in part
by functioning as a coactivator of AR transcription. CARP1/CCAR1 plays a crucial role in recruiting GATA2, a key
mediator of transcription by AR, in androgen dependent
signaling [13]. Knockdown of endogenous CARP-1/CCAR1,
compromised the hormone dependent recruitment of mediator
complexes to NRs, and consequently impacted growth of
hormone dependent cancer cells [10]. Another recent study
revealed CARP-1/CCAR1 is a binding partner of β-catenin
and enhances the transcriptional activation of β-catenin-Wnt
target genes, and mediates anchorage independent growth of
colon cancer cells. Depletion of CARP-1/CCAR1 or β-catenin
attenuated ability of the colon cancer cells to form colonies in
soft agar [14].
Thus, significant investigations suggest that CARP1/CCAR1 plays important roles in regulating cancer cell
growth in part by recruiting multiple mediators and confers
optimal conformation for transcriptional functions of NRs.
Additionally CARP-1/CCAR1 co-activates the pro-apoptotic
tumor suppressor p53 in chemotherapy (ADR)-treated
cells. Co-activation of p53 and NRs by CARP-1/CCAR1
highlights its broader biphasic roles in regulating cell growth
and apoptosis signaling [10] that are discussed below.

By utilizing a functional gene knockout technology,
CARP-1/CCAR1 was originally identified as a peri-nuclear
phospho-protein that was required for apoptosis signaling
by a retinoid (CD437) as well as chemotherapeutics
Adriamycin (ADR) and Etoposide in the Human Breast
Cancer (HBC) cells [3]. The current GenBank database
indicates nucleotide sequences encoding CARP-1/CCAR1
proteins of various species including Mus musculus
(mouse), Canis lupus (dog), Rattus norvegicus (rat),
Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), Gallus gallus (domestic
chicken), Danio rerio (zebrafish), Xenopus laevis,
Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) and Ornithorhynchus
anatinus (platypus). Human CARP-1/CCAR1 gene is
located at the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q21–10q22),
and encodes a transcript of ~3.5 kilobase (kb) size. The
CARP-1/CCAR1 protein has 1150 amino acid residues
with approximate molecular mass of 130 kiloDaltons
(kDa). A number of studies to date have revealed
CARP-1/CCAR1 involvement in cell proliferation as well
as apoptosis signaling in a variety of cell types including
different cancer cells [4, 5].

CARP-1/CCAR1 as a regulator of steroid/
thyroid receptor signaling
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are highly conserved family
of transcription factors that regulate transcription of target
genes in ligand–dependent manner. NRs include receptors for
estrogen (ER, NR3A), progesterone (PR, NR3C3), vitamin
A (RAR, NR1B), vitamin D (VDR, NR1I1), androgen (AR,
NR3C4), and thyroid hormones (TR, NR1A). NRs bind to
specific DNA sequences in response to their ligand binding,
which in turn recruits other co-activators that remodels the
chromatin in regulating RNA polymerase II associated basal
transcriptional mechanism [6]. For example, P160 family of
coactivators that include Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1;
also known as nuclear receptor coactivator-1; NCoA-1), SRC-2
(also known as Glutamate receptor interacting protein 1;
GRIP1, Transcriptional intermediary factor 2; TIF2 or
NcoA-2), and SRC-3 (also known as ACTR, Amplified in
breast 1; AIB1, pCIP, RAC3, or Thyroid hormone receptor
activator molecule 1; TRAM1) harbor multiple leucine rich
repeat (LXXLL) motifs, which promote ligand-dependent
interactions with the activation function 2 (AF2) domain
of the NRs [6]. The p160 coactivators also recruit multiple
acteyltransferases including CBP/p300 and P300-CBP
associated protein (PCAF) and methyltransferase coactivators
such as coactivator-associated arginine methyl transferase 1
(CARM1) and Protein arginine methyl transferase 1 and 2
(PRMT1 & 2) as well as other downstream targets including
coiled-coil coactivator (CoCoA) [7, 8]. Some nuclear
hormone receptors such as ERα regulate activator protein
(AP)-1 dependent gene expression by directly binding with
c-Jun and JunB proteins but not with c-fos proteins [9].

gene and is considered as an important paralog of
CARP-1/CCAR1 gene. DBC1 was originally discovered
and cloned from short arm of chromosome 8 (8p21), which
was homozygously deleted in a subset of breast cancers
[15]. DBC1 interacts with and negatively regulates SIRT1
deacetylase activity [16, 17]. Subsequent studies revealed
that SIRT1 inhibition by DBC1 results in increased
acetylation of p53 that, in turn, mediates p53-dependent
apoptosis following DNA damage [16, 17]. Inhibition
of SIRT1 by DBC1in the DNA damage response (DDR)
depends on ATM-dependent Chk2 activation [18]. This
Chk2 activation in turn promotes phosphorylation of the
11S proteasome activator REGγ, which increases REGγ–
DBC1 interaction and SIRT1 inhibition [18]. Caspasedependent processing of DBC1 has also been implicated
in its pro-apoptotic activity during tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNFα)-mediated apoptosis [19]. However DBC1
loss also promotes death of breast cancer cells [20] while
its expression is associated with distant metastatic relapse
in patients after receiving endocrine therapy, and thus is an
indicator of poor prognosis in a subset of patients [21, 22].
A broader function of DBC1 in metabolism, aging and
cancer has recently been highlighted in an elegant review
by Chini et al. [23]. Overall, studies thus far suggest that
like CARP-1/CCAR1, DBC1 could also play biphasic
roles in proliferation and apoptosis signaling.
Although CARP-1/CCAR1 and DBC1 proteins
are paralogs, a recent report revealed that both the DBC1
and CARP-1/CCAR1 are largely disordered proteins that
evolved from a single common ancestor, the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans protein lateral signaling target
(LST)-3 [24]. DBC1 emerged later in evolution than CARP1/CCAR1 and first appeared in Danio rerio (zebrafish).
Interestingly, the DBC1 gene is not present in insects,
amphibians, or birds [24]. Nevertheless, a synergistic
co-regulation of CARP-1/CCAR1 by DBC1 in mediating
ERα target gene transcription in MCF7 and T47D HBC
cells was noted in a recent study [25]. DBC1 and CARP1/CCAR1 cooperatively enhanced and co-activated the
ligand-dependent transcription functions of multiple NRs
including AR, GR and TR. Depletion of either DBC1
or CARP-1/CCAR1 or both attenuated transcription of
ERα target genes [25]. With reference to the co-activator
functions, a genome-wide comparative analysis following
knock-down of CARP-1/CCAR1 or DBC1 revealed
that each co-regulator regulates only a select subset of
physiological pathways controlled by glucocorticoids, and
the gene-specific actions of these co-activators correspond
to specific physiological pathways [26]

also co-activates signaling by transcription factors for the
normal physiological development. Noggin (Ngn)3 is a
helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays a key role
in mediating endocrine differentiation. Notably, Ngn3
regulates pancreatic cell proliferation and differentiation
processes and thus serves as a key determinant in
pancreatic cell fate during development. CARP-1/
CCAR1 binds with Ngn3 in nucleus and co-activates its
downstream target gene NeuroD to regulate endocrine
differentiation in pancreas during development [27].
Therefore, a broader set of transcriptional co-activation
roles of CARP-1/CCAR1 in cell growth, metastasis, and
differentiation processes can be deduced on the basis
of its ability to co-activate NRs, β-catenin, and Ngn3
[8, 15, 27].
Another recent study revealed modulation of CARP1/CCAR1 expression and distribution by parathyroid
hormone (PTH) in osteoblast differentiation [28]. PTH
regulates both anabolic and catabolic process in osteoblast
growth and differentiation, and regulates translocation of
CARP-1/CCAR1 from nucleus to cytoplasm in remodeling
and development of bone tissue. It is well established that
Wnt-β-catenin signaling is required for bone physiology
[29–31]. Moreover, PTH induces β-catenin activation in
multiple cells including UMR, MC3T3-E1 and SAOS
[32–35]. Considering the ability of CARP-1/CCAR1
to co-activate Wnt-β-catenin target gene transcription,
it is conceivable that CARP-1/CCAR1 could serve as a
docking protein to finely regulate β-catenin signaling and
apoptosis in the presence of PTH in remodeling bone
tissue and development.
Necdin, a member of the MAGE (Melanoma Antigen)
protein family, binds with CARP-1/CCAR1, and promotes
proteosomal degradation of pro-apoptotic CARP-1/CCAR1
in turn enhancing myoblast differentiation and survival [36].
Interestingly, Necdin also functions as a transcriptional
repressor of p53 and inhibits apoptosis [37] regulated by
TNFα signaling in preventing muscle atrophy [38]. In light
of the fact that CARP-1/CCAR1 co-activates pro-apoptotic
transcriptional function of p53, it appears that by negatively
regulating CARP-1/CCAR1 Necdin counter-acts the proapoptotic activities of p53 and thus contributes to myoblast
survival. Additionally, CARP-1/CCAR1 serves as a binding
partner of AKAP350A, a multifunctional scaffolding
protein, present in Golgi apparatus and centrosomes, along
with RAS-GAP SH3 domain binding protein (G3BP),
a stress granule marker, and Caprin-1 (Cytoplasmic
activation/proliferation-associated protein 1). The oxidative
stress following arsenite treatment results in translocation of
CARP-1/CCAR1-AKAP350A-G3BP-Caprin-1 complex to
RNA stress granules [39]. Since G3BP is known to protect
cellular mRNA under stress conditions [40], and CARP-1/
CCAR1 protein harbors a cold-shock RNA-binding domain
[3], it appears that CARP-1/CCAR1 association with
AKAP350A/G3BP/Caprin-1 complex in stress granules
likely functions to sequester RNAs to maintain stability

Role of CARP-1/CCAR1 in physiological
development

clinic and contributes to failure in therapy response in
cancer patients and results in poor prognosis. Therefore,
urgent efforts are warranted to identify additional perhaps
new druggable targets to improve therapy efficacy and
overcome the resistance mechanisms.
As mentioned earlier, CARP-1/CCAR1 was
originally indentified and characterized as perinuclear
phosphoprotein that was required for apoptosis signaling
by chemotherapy drugs ADR and Etoposide independent
of the p53 status of the HBC cells [3]. As summarized
in figure 1, apoptosis induction by CARP-1/CCAR1
involves its binding with 14–3-3 protein, stimulation of
CDKI p21WAF1CIP1 levels and down-regulation of cell
growth and cell cycle regulators c-Myc, topoisomerase

CARP-1/CCAR1 as a regulator of
stress-dependent apoptosis
Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death,
plays a pivotal role in maintaining proper tissue
homeostasis. Deregulation of apoptosis contributes to
various pathological conditions including inflammation
and tumorigenesis. Apoptosis is considered as an important
attribute of the chemotherapy drugs and serves to eliminate
the damaged cancer cells [41, 42]. However, resistance
to therapy-induced apoptosis is often encountered in the

IIα, cyclin B and p21 Rac1 [3]. Genetic studies revealed
that C. elegans Lst3, an ortholog of human CARP-1/
CCAR1, is a transducer of Notch signaling. Lst3 also
functions as an inhibitor of the EGFR-MAPK pathway
[43]. These findings support our earlier studies that
demonstrated CARP-1/CCAR1 requirement for apoptosis
signaling following EGFR blockage in HBC cells [4].
Apoptosis signaling following EGFR inhibition invloves
CARP-1/CCAR1 phosphorylation at tyrosine (Y)192,
activation of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)
p38α/β and caspase 9 [4]. Interestingly, phosphorylation
of Y189 of murine CARP-1/CCAR1 that corresponds
with the Y192 of the human homolog has been noted in a
global screening of p-tyrosine profile of Src-transformed
MEFs [44]. It is likely that a context-dependent tyrosine
phosphorylation of CARP-1/CCAR1 plays an important
role in signaling for tumor growth or apoptosis, and
a thorough functional characterization is needed for
further understanding of the mechanism(s) involved.
Pharmcologic inhibition of Protein kinase A (PKA)
resulted in suppression of HBC cell growth in part by
targeting CARP-1/CCAR1 threonine (T)667-dependent
reduced c-Myc transcription [5]. A number of previous
studies have revealed serine (S), and/or threonine (T) as
well as tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation of CARP-1/CCAR1
by a variety of different signaling pathways [45–47].
CARP-1/CCAR1 was also found to be a nuclear protein
in HeLa cells where it was phosphorylated at its Carboxyl
terminus S1149, although the precise signaling context was
not elucidated [45]. A compilation of the CARP-1/CCAR1
residues modified by phosphorylation and ubiquitination
culminating from various proteomic and signaling
studies thus far is available at http://www.phosphosite.
org. Of note is that signaling by RIP3 kinase, oncogenic
phosphatase CDC25B, Aurora and Polo-like kinases
phosphorylate CARP-1/CCAR1 T627 [48–51], however,
no kinase has been identified that directly phosphorylates
CARP-1/CCAR1 Y192, T627, T667, or S1149.
Epigenetic modifications such as CpG island
methylation, histone modification, and deregulation of
DNA binding proteins are as important as gene mutation
in the process of tumorigenesis. Such epigenetic
alterations could either silence key tumor suppressor(s)
or promote activation of oncogene(s). In this context our
prior reports revealed that CARP-1/CCAR1 expression
correlated inversely with the grades of human tumors
of breast and lymphoma origins [52, 53]. Although a
limited number of specimens were analyzed, diminished
expression of CARP-1/CCAR1 in human breast cancers
involved methylation-dependent gene silencing that
was associated with hypermethylation of CARP-1/
CCAR1 promoter [52]. On the other hand, HBC
cells stably overexpressing CARP-1/CCAR1 formed
reduced sized subcutaneous tumors compared with
their wild-type counterparts when xenografted in the
immunocompromised SCID mice [52].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A recent study reported that Par-4 (prostate
apoptosis response factor -4) and THAP1, a sequence
specific DNA binding factor, synergestically cooperate
to enhance CARP-1/CCAR1 expression, and promote
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (T-ALL)
apoptosis [54]. It is known that deregulation of Notch
signaling contributes to generation of T-ALL [55].
Here, Par-4/THAP1 complex and Notch 3 competitively
regulate alternative splicing of CARP-1/CCAR1 mRNA
and impact the T-ALL cell survival. Thus exogenous
expression of Notch-ICD (intracellular domain) results in
production of truncated form of CARP-1/CCAR1 protein
of ~90 kDa along with the full length CARP-1/CCAR1
protein of ~130 kDa, and inhibits Par-4/THAP1 induced
CARP-1/CCAR1 expression and apoptosis. Silencing of
Notch resulted in the disappearance of truncated ~90 kDa
form of CARP-1/CCAR1 and restoration of apoptosis [54].
Although a truncated variant of CARP-1/CCAR1 appears
to function as an inhibitor of apoptosis signaling by wildtype CARP-1/CCAR1 in T-ALL cells, ectopic expression
of retroviral TAT-domain fusions of a number of nonoverlapping CARP-1/CCAR1 peptides that accumulated
in the cytosolic compartment, inhibited growth of HBC
and lymphoma cells in vitro, and suppressed growth of
the lymphoma as well as the breast cancer cell-derived
xenografts in SCID mice [52, 53]. Another recent report
demonstrated that CARP-1/CCAR1 directly binds with
LIM-domain protein Zyxin and promotes UV-induced
apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [56].
Zyxin regulates actin assembly and shuttles between
focal adhesions and cell nuclei in respose to mechanical
stress. Further, in response to UV-C irradiation, CARP-1/
CCAR1 binds to LIM domain of zyxin and promotes its
pro-apoptotic activity while expression of zyxin mutant
lacking LIM domain failed to bind with CARP-1/CCAR1
and interfered with apoptosis [56]. Consistent with
the property of CARP-1/CCAR1 to regulate apoptosis
signaling, a couple of studies revealed that CARP-1/
CCAR1 is downregulated in a gene expression profiles
of tumors derived from rasv12/E1A-transformed MEFs
[57], and in peripheral blood cells from neurodegenerative
disease, Friedreich’s Ataxia patients [58]. Overall, it is
increasingly becoming evident that CARP-1/CCAR1
also functions as a tumor suppressor and/or mediator of
apoptosis in diverse cancers [3–5, 10, 45, 52–54]. The
pathways and interactions involved in pleiotropic signal
transduction by CARP-1/CCAR1 that are known to date
are summarized in Table 1.

the fact that TAT-mediated transduction of various nonoverlapping peptides of CARP-1/CCAR1 suppressed
the growth of HBC and lymphoma cells in vitro and in
vivo [52, 53], and CARP-1/CCAR1 co-activates p53 to
transduce ADR-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells
[10], we speculated that CARP-1/CCAR1 likely regulates
cell growth and apoptosis signaling by associating with
additional key components of cell growth and cell cycle
signal transduction pathways. To test this possibility, we
performed a yeast two-hybrid screening assay to identify
additional binding partners of CARP-1/CCAR1. We found
that CARP-1/CCAR1 specifically interacts with Anaphase
Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) subunit APC-2
protein [61]. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)-western
blot (WB) experiments revealed that CARP-1/CCAR1
(896–978) peptide harbored the epitope which interacts
with APC-2. Additional co-IP-WB experiments revealed
that CARP-1/CCAR1 also interacts with Cdc20 and Cdh1,
co-activators of APC/C. The CARP-1/CCAR1 epitope that
interacts with Cdc20 or Cdh1 is distinct from its APC-2interacting epitope [61]. These findings indicate a broader
CARP-1/CCAR1 association with APC/C proteome [61].
In light of the fact that APC/C plays a distinct role in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

various cell cycle checkpoints [62, 63] and deregulation
of APC/C and its regulators and substrates has been
implicated in tumor progression [64], the components of
the APC/C proteome including its co-activator CARP-1/
CCAR1 therefore represent attractive targets for design
of cell cycle inhibitory strategies with potential for
therapeutic use [65–67].

CARP-1/CCAR1 Functional Mimetics (CFMs)
Based on the knowledge of CARP-1/CCAR1 proapoptotic signaling in diverse cancer cells, and the fact
that CARP-1/CCAR1 binds with APC-2 and co-activates
APC/C, while APC/C is a crucial regulator of cell cycle,
led us to speculate that disruption of APC/C co-activation
by CARP-1/CCAR1 could impact cell cycle progression
and ultimately the growth and survival of the cells. To
test this possibility, we conducted a high-throughput
chemical biology experiment to identify small molecule
inhibitors (SMIs) of CARP-1/CCAR1-APC-2 interaction.
This experiment yielded multiple, novel SMIs of
CARP-1/CCAR1-APC-2 binding, termed CARP-1/
CCAR1 Functional Mimetics (CFMs) [61]. CFM-1,

CFM-4, and CFM-5 compounds inhibited CARP-1/
CCAR1-APC-2 interaction with IC50 values of 4, 1,
and 0.75 μM, respectively, while CFM-4 and CFM-5
compounds also bind with CARP-1/CCAR1. Although
all the three compounds inhibited growth of a variety
of cancer cells including HBC cells in vitro, CFM-4
and CFM-5 compounds induced G2M cell cycle arrest,
promoted loss of cyclin B1, p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1. CFMs
cause increase in CARP-1/CCAR1 levels, and apoptosis in
part by activation of caspases-9, -8, and -3 [61]. Moreover,
pharmacologic blockage of caspase-8, but not caspase-9,
prevented apoptosis by CFM-4 indicating that caspase-8
activation is necessary for apoptosis signaling by CFM-4
[61; Figure 2]. Importantly, knock-down of CARP-1/
CCAR1 or APC/C co-activator Cdh1 interferes with
apoptosis by CFM-4, suggesting that CARP-1/CCAR1
and Cdh1 play a crucial role in regulating apoptosis by
CFMs [61]. Moreover, CFM-4 attenuates proliferation
of the ADR or Tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant MCF7 HBC
cells without impacting the growth of immortalized,
non-tumorigenic human MCF-10A cells [61]. Thus, our
discoveries of CARP-1/CCAR1 and CFMs provide a
proof-of-concept that CARP-1/CCAR1 signaling could be

exploited to identify agents to inhibit breast cancer cells
and their drug-resistant variants.
Given the fact that CFMs inhibited growth
of breast cancer cells, we further investigated their
potential in inhibiting other cancers such as malignant
pleural mesothelioma (MPM), medulloblastoma (MB),
neuroblastoma (NB) and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) that often have poor prognosis and are known
to develop resistance to therapeutic modalities in clinic.
Consistent with our previous observations with HBC cells,
CFM-4 and CFM-5 compounds inhibited the growth of
MPM, MB, NB, and NSCLC cells [68–71] in part by
activating apoptosis signaling and diminishing the levels
of key cell cycle regulatory proteins including cyclin-B1,
c- and N-myc. Both CFM-4 and CFM-5 compounds
enhanced expression of CARP-1/CCAR1 along with
activation of pro-apoptotic SAPKs (p38α/β and JNK1/2)
[68–71]. CFMs, particularly CFM-4, also activated NF-κB
signaling by depleting its inhibitors ABIN1 and inhibitory
κB (IκB) α and β proteins [68–70], while increasing the
expression of pro-apoptotic death receptor (DR) 4 protein.
CFM-4 also enhanced expression of serine-phosphorylated
cell surface sialo-glycoprotein podoplanin that regulates

cell motility and integrity, while promoting cleavage
of vimentin in MPM cells [69]. In light of the fact that
serine phosphorylation in the short cytoplasmic domain
of podoplanin interferes with the processes of cellular
motility [72], podoplanin phosphorylation and cleavage of
vimentin in the CFM-4-treated MPM cells would suggest
for motility and metastasis-inhibitory properties of CFMs
[69]. Our gene-array based analysis in MB cells revealed
that CFM-4 enhanced the expression of neurotrophin
(NTF3), while depletion of NTF3 expression inhibited
MB cell apoptosis by CFM-4, suggesting a potential
therapeutic window with CFM-4 mediated apoptosis
through NTF3 signaling in MB cells [68].
Interestingly, a high-throughput miRNA profiling of
malignant pediatric tumor NB cells revealed up-regulation
of XIAP-targeting miR513a-5p in response to CFM4 treatment [70]. Both CFM-4 and CFM-5 compounds
significantly abrogated the expression of cell survival
associated XIAP1, cIAP1 and survivin proteins in NB
as well as in HBC cells. Moreover, expression of antimiR513a-5p or miR513a-5p mimic interfered with or
enhanced, respectively, the apoptosis by CFM-4 in HBC
cells [70], suggesting involvement of miR-dependent posttranscriptional targeting of XIAP family of proteins in
inhibiting both NB and HBC cell growth in the presence of
CFM-4 [70; Figure 2]. Although CFM compounds target
podoplanin and vimentin signaling, further in vitro studies
indicate that CFMs impact ability of the MB, MPM, NB,
NSCLC, and HBC cells to grow in soft agar, migrate to
close a wound, and invade through the matrigel-coated
membranes [68–71].
In an attempt to develop CFMs as potential anticancer agent, we performed structure activity relationship
(SAR) studies and identified six additional compounds,
termed as CFM-4.1 – CFM-4.6, that were structurally
similar to our lead compound CFM-4. Among all, CFM4.6 was very effective in inhibiting the growth of NSCLC
(A549, H1299) and MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro. Consistent with our earlier
studies, both CFM-4 and CFM-4.6 enhanced the CARP-1/
CCAR1 expression and activated the pro-apoptotic SAPKs
p38α/β and JNK1/2. Additionally, we found that these
compounds stimulated the expression of death effector
domain containing protein DEDD2. Co-IP-WB studies
revealed that CARP-1/CCAR1 directly interacts with
DEDD2, FADD, RIPK1 and p43/41 fragment of cleaved
caspase 8 [71]. Since activation of caspase 8 is required for
apoptosis by CFM-4 [61], and the fact that activation of
caspase 8 is often regulated by TNFα receptor (TNFR)/DR
family of proteins [73–75], it is likely that CFMs promote
formation of an apical, pro-apoptotic sub-complex of
CARP-1/CCAR1-DEDD2-FADD-RIPK1-p43/41 caspase 8
proteins. Moreover, since CARP-1/CCAR1 and DEDD2 are
known to shuttle between cytosol and nucleus [3, 76, 77],
it is possible that CFMs induce apoptosis by stimulating
levels of CARP-1/CCAR1 and DEDD2 proteins and their
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

intracellular shuttling to transduce apoptosis [71]. CFM-4,
CFM-5, and CFM-4 analog CFM-4.6 disrupt formation of
tubules by human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in
vitro, suggesting that these compounds likely also possess
anti-angiogenic properties [71].

CFM-4 nano lipid formulations (CFM-4 NLFs)
To demonstrate the therapeutic potential of CFMs,
preclinical studies in xenograft models of MB, MPM,
and breast cancers were carried out. Direct, intravenous
administration of CFM-4 cocktail failed to inhibit
growth of subcutaneously xenografted tumor cells in
immunocompromised mice [71]. Since, nanolipid based
formulations often increase the physicochemical stability
of both the drug molecules and particulate system, and
have higher drug-loading capacity, we next investigated
whether a nanolipid based formulation of CFM-4 could
be generated and utilized to further test the therapeutic
potential of CFM-4 compound. A natural, biocompatible
cationic polysaccharide Chitosan-based nanolipid
formulation of CFM-4 (CFM-4 NLF) was prepared as
described before [71, 78]. CFM-4 NLF had superior
bioavailability and pharmacokinetics when compared
with the CFM-4 free drug [71], and inhibited growth of
xenografted TNBC and NSCLC tumors in nude mice,
when administered orally [71]. Biochemical analyses of
representative NSCLC and TNBC tumor xenografts from
placebo (control) or CFM-4 NLF-treated animals revealed
accumulation of CFM-4 NLF in tumors of treated animals.
Additionally, Immuno-histological analyses showed
elevated levels of CARP-1/CCAR1 and fragmented DNA
in tumors of CFM-4 NLF-treated animals when compared
with those of placebo-treated controls [71]. These findings
provide a proof-of-concept that CFMs possess therapeutic
potential, and function in vivo in part by stimulating
CARP-1/CCAR1 levels and apoptosis.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVE
Overall, it is becoming increasingly evident that
CARP-1/CCAR1 regulates signaling ranging from
co-activation of physiological responses to steroids,
processes of cellular differentiation and homeostasis
in different tissues, to the chemotherapy-dependent
apoptosis signaling with or without co-activation of
tumor suppressor p53. Identification of CFMs through
the chemical biology strategies provides a further proofof-concept that CARP-1/CCAR1 and an aspect of its
signaling could be exploited to inhibit cancer cells. The
lead compound CFM-4 inhibits growth of a variety of
cancer cells including the chemo-resistant breast cancer
cells without impacting growth of immortalized, nontumorigenic breast epithelial cells. Although CFM-4
and CFM-5 compounds function in part by binding and
6506

elevating cellular levels of CARP-1/CCAR1, apoptosis
by radiation, chemotherapy (such as ADR, Etoposide, or
Gefitinib), the CFM-4 and CFM-5 compounds, and the
physiological responses of various steroids nevertheless
require CARP-1/CCAR1. Thus targeting of CARP-1/
CCAR1 could allow for physiological fine tuning of
steroid responses, the discovery of CFMs and their
future analogs on the other hand offer novel tools for
design of anti-cancer strategies for combating a variety
of cancers including the TNBCs and their drug-resistant
variants. The promising in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical
studies thus far provide a compelling rationale for further
exploration of the pleiotropic cell growth and apoptosis
signaling by CARP-1/CCAR1, and potential of CFMs as
novel agents for optimization of anti-cancer therapeutic
strategies. Since current treatment options for TNBCs
as well as drug-resistant cancers of breast, lung, MPM,
and neurological origins are limited, discovery and
development of molecules based on CARP-1/CCAR1
signaling could yield novel tools for management and
treatment of cancers and thus potentially serve an urgent
and unmet need.
