Abstract
Imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have
improved treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML);
however, most patients are not cured. Deeper mechanistic understanding may improve TKI combination therapies to better control the residual leukemic cell population. In analyzing our
patients' data, we found that many patients who otherwise
responded well to imatinib therapy still showed variations in
their BCR–ABL transcripts. To investigate this phenomenon, we
applied a mathematical model that integrates CML and an autologous immune response to the patients' data. We deﬁne an
immune window or a range of leukemic loads for which the
autologous immune system induces an improved response. Our

Major Findings
On the basis of patient data and our model, we hypothesize
that the autologous immune system plays a signiﬁcant role in
the dynamics of CML during imatinib therapy. Moreover,
variations in BCR–ABL transcripts during imatinib therapy
may represent a signature of the patient's individual autologous immune response. Immunotherapy may complement
imatinib and other TKIs by helping to maintain a patient's
autologous immune response when the leukemia stimulus
alone is insufﬁcient. Our mathematical model is a potentially
valuable tool in studying and designing patient-speciﬁc schedules for these combination therapies.

modeling results suggest that, at diagnosis, a patient's leukemic
load is able to partially or fully suppress the autologous immune
response developed in a majority of patients, toward the CML
clone(s). Imatinib therapy drives the leukemic population into
the "immune window," allowing the patient's autologous
immune cells to expand and eventually mount an efﬁcient recognition of the residual leukemic burden. This response drives the
leukemic load below this immune window, allowing the leukemic population to partially recover until another weaker immune
response is initiated. Thus, the autologous immune response may
explain the oscillations in BCR–ABL transcripts regularly observed
in patients on imatinib. Cancer Res; 75(19); 4053–62. 2015 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative
disorder caused by the BCR–ABL fusion oncogene, which encodes
for a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as imatinib, are targeted therapies that have
revolutionized the treatment of CML, producing durable remissions in many patients and resulting in substantially improved
long-term survival rates (1, 2). Despite their success, their global
therapeutic effect remains incompletely understood. Moreover, it
is unclear whether TKIs alone are capable of eliminating the entire
leukemic burden, as many patients in long-term remissions
continue to harbor small residual leukemic loads even after many
years of therapy (3). A better understanding of TKIs would allow
us to improve the way that these drugs are administered and also
to identify their limitations. If TKIs prove to be incapable of curing
most patients, then understanding the drugs' mechanisms of
action may inform our use of combination therapies.
There is compelling evidence that a patient's autologous
immune response plays a signiﬁcant role in the dynamics of
CML. It is known that immune cells are capable of detecting
and eliminating cancer cells (4). Immunotherapy is a major
goal of immunology and cancer research because of the ability
of the immune system to target and eliminate abnormal cells
while leaving healthy cells intact. In the allogeneic setting, the
immune system has demonstrated its power in the elimination
of residual CML disease (5). Several combination therapies
involving interferon-a (IFNa) are currently being investigated
(6, 7, 8), in part, because of this drug's effects on the autologous
immune system (8), which participates in the control of the

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
We developed an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and the immune
system to study the dynamics of imatinib therapy. Speciﬁcally, we seek to understand patients whose BCR–ABL ratios vary
nonmonotonically during therapy.
Let y0, y1, y2, and y3 represent the concentrations of quiescent leukemic stem cells, cycling leukemic stem cells, progenitor leukemic
cells, and mature leukemic cells. Let z denote the concentration of immune cells. We consider the following system of ODEs:
y_ 0 ¼ b1 y1  a0 y0 

my0 z
1 þ "y32

my3 z
1 þ ey32

ðDÞ

z_ ¼ sz  dz z þ

ay3 z
1 þ ey32

ðEÞ

In Eqs. A and B, a0 and b1 represent the transition rates of leukemic stem cells from quiescence to cycling and cycling to
quiescence, respectively. We assume logistic growth of cycling stem cells, with growth rate r and carrying capacity K. Cycling
stem cells die naturally at a rate d1. In Eq. C, the ﬁrst term represents the differentiation of stem cells into progenitors. The
coefﬁcient a1 is the product of the differentiation rate and the ampliﬁcation factor upon differentiation due to cell proliferation.
Progenitors die naturally at a rate d2. Equation D is similar to C, with differentiation rate a2 and death rate d3. The last terms in
Eqs. A to D represent the death of leukemic cells caused by an immune response. The mass action term m yi z represents the
killing of leukemic cells by the immune system, where m is the maximal rate (per immune cell) at which an immune cell will
engage and kill a leukemic cell. Equation E represents the concentration of autologous immune cells. The ﬁrst term sz is a
constant source term. Immune cells die at a rate dz. The mass action term ay3z represents the expansion (proliferation) of the
immune cell pool in response to its leukemia stimulus, which occurs with maximal rate per leukemic cell a. We include only the
contributions of the mature leukemic cells y3 to immune stimulation because they are a much larger population than the
immature leukemic cells (ytotal  y3).
Our model is based on the assumption that immunosuppression acts in two ways. First, mature leukemic cells inhibit the
expansion of immune cells. In Eq. E, the immune cell expansion term ay3z is divided by 1 þ ey23 , where the constant e determines
the strength of the immunosuppression. Second, mature leukemic cells are assumed to decrease the killing capacity m of activated
immune cells, also by a factor of 1 þ ey23 . This effect is represented in the last terms in Eqs. A to D. This approach is similar to the one
used in ref. 9. By implementing immunosuppression in this way, we encode an autologous immune response that is effective
only with intermediate levels of leukemic cells. When the leukemic load is small, only a small number of immune cells
are stimulated to respond. On the other hand, although large leukemic loads provide a stronger stimulus, the leukemic cells
are able to suppress the efﬁcacy of the immune system. Thus, the immune response will be negligible when the leukemic load is
either very small, at levels undetectable by the immune system, or very large, at levels that overwhelm and suppress the immune
system. A strong immune response can occur only when the leukemic load y3 is at an intermediate level, within a range [ymin, ymax]
that we call the immune window. In our model, we deﬁne the immune window as the range of y3, for which the rate of immune

stimulation ay3 =ð1 þ "y23 Þ exceeds the death rate (dz). Imatinib therapy may be used to drive the leukemic load into this immune
window, allowing the autologous immune system to assist the drug in the elimination of the leukemic cells.
Imatinib is known to block the kinase activity of the BCR–ABL protein, which results in a signiﬁcant decrease in the
proliferation rates of the BCR–ABLþ leukemic cells (1, 10) and apoptotic death (11). However, we focus here on the effects
of imatinib on proliferation and leave incorporation of other mechanisms to a future work. We implement imatinib
therapy, starting at time t ¼ 0, by decreasing the differentiation/ampliﬁcation rates a1 and a2 to lower values a10 ¼ a1/inh1
and a20 ¼ a2/inh2. It is unknown how imatinib affects leukemic stem cells and whether quiescent leukemic stem cells are
affected at all, so we assume no direct effect of imatinib on these populations. However, our model provides a framework for
testing various mechanisms of actions of imatinib, which we leave for a future work.
It is also unclear whether imatinib is capable of completely eliminating the leukemic cell burden or whether small residual
populations will persist indeﬁnitely. In our model, a leukemic load of zero can only be approached asymptotically, so we deﬁne cure
as a cancer stem cell concentration less than 1.67(10)4 cells/mL, which corresponds to less than one leukemic stem cell. We stop all
simulations of the model whenever this is achieved.

disease. In addition, IFNa may drive quiescent leukemic stem
cells into the cell cycle (12, 13), where they become exposed to
the effects of TKIs.
In the Stop imatinib (STIM; ref. 14) and TWISTER (3) trials,
patients who responded well to imatinib were taken off therapy in
order to determine whether treatment-free remission (TFR) could
be achieved. They found that approximately 40% of patients
remained in TFR for at least 2 years after stopping treatment.
Moreover, although not statistically signiﬁcant, the TFR rate
was higher in patients that had received IFNa prior to imatinib
(14). In many of these patients, BCR–ABL DNA and mRNA were
still detectable (3). Moreover, in ref. 15, patients still harbored
BCR–ABLþ leukemic stem cells, despite having remained in TFR
for up to 8 years. In these cases, because treatment did not
completely eradicate the disease, some other mechanisms, such
as the autologous immune system, must be preventing this
residual cancer population from expanding. Motivated by these
results, we constructed a mathematical model integrating CML
and the autologous immune response.

Materials and Methods
A group of 104 patients with CML was monitored during
imatinib therapy in the Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud (Lyon,
France). These patients were all treated with ﬁrst-line imatinib
400 mg daily. Patients' BCR–ABL ratios were measured in the
same laboratory according to the guidelines of European LeukemiaNet, with the same techniques at diagnosis, months 3, 6, 9,
and 12 of therapy, and every 6 months thereafter; in order to limit
variability, each measurement was run in duplicate, and the two
resulting measurements were averaged. Overall, the patients had
an average follow-up time of 62.76 months (range, 2.96–148.70),
with an average of 12.69 measurements taken (range, 2–26). We
excluded patients who changed TKIs for safety reasons (n ¼ 33)
and patients whose disease progressed (n ¼ 14), as we focused
exclusively in this study on patients obtaining a residual disease
on imatinib. Thus, a population of 65 patients who responded
well to imatinib remained for analysis.

BCR–ABL ratios were serially measured by quantitative RTPCR in the peripheral blood of patients in the same laboratory
according to the European standards of European Leukemia
Net recommendations (16, 17) and expressed as a percentage
on the International Scale (IS; ref. 18). Each sampling was run
in duplicate in order to reduce variability and additionally run
in parallel to the previous (frozen) sample from each patient in
order to exclude technical problems, at each time point (except
diagnosis) for all patients. A 2-fold variation was considered as
signiﬁcant (19).
Our mathematical model divides leukemic cells into quiescent
stem cells (y0), cycling stem cells (y1), progenitors (y2), and mature
cells (y3). We also represent a single autologous immune cell
population (z). For simplicity, we do not distinguish further
between immune subpopulations. Leukemia cells stimulate
immune cells to proliferate at a maximum rate a, while immune
cells kill leukemia cells at a maximum rate m. We incorporate
immunosuppression by inhibiting the proliferation of the
immune cells as well as their action on leukemic cells. Our model
is summarized in Fig. 1. A more thorough description of the
model is provided in the Quick Guide to Equations and
Assumptions.
The BCR–ABL ratio is a blood measurement that quantiﬁes the
amount of BCR–ABL transcript relative to a control gene transcript, BCR, GUS, or ABL (here, ABL). Each leukemic cell possesses
the BCR–ABL gene and the normal allele of the ABL gene, while
healthy cells (x) possess two alleles of the ABL gene. Therefore,
BCR–ABL transcripts are proportional to y3 (the immature leukemia cell populations are much smaller than the mature population and can be neglected), while control transcripts are
approximately proportional to 2x þ y3. For simplicity, the number
of healthy cells (x) is assumed to be constant and is estimated on
the basis of the patient's initial BCR–ABL ratio at diagnosis. For all
later measurements, the BCR–ABL ratio is approximated by
ratio  100b

Mathematical model including the intervention
of the autologous immune system. In our model
of CML and the immune response, we divide
leukemic cells into quiescent stem cells (y0),
cycling stem cells (y1), progenitors (y2), and
mature cells (y3). Stem cells transition between
quiescence and cycling, and some cycling stem
cells differentiate into progenitors cells, which
can further differentiate into mature cells.
Leukemic cells can die naturally at rates di or as a
result of an interaction with immune cells (z).
Immune cells are supposed in this disease to be
supplied at a constant rate sz and to die at a rate
dz. They can also be stimulated by leukemic cells
to divide to produce more immune cells. Large
leukemic populations are able to suppress the
autologous immune system by limiting immune
cell expansion and limiting immune effector cells'
ability to kill cancer cells.

Figure 2.
Oscillations of the BCR–ABL ratio in two representative patients. During TKI therapy, a patient's progress is monitored by measuring their BCR–ABL ratio,
which is a ratio of BCR–ABL mRNA expression to the expression of a control gene, in this case ABL. Both patients shown above were treated with standard
imatinib 400 mg daily. During treatment, both patients showed multiple increases in BCR–ABL ratio without overt relapse. Here, dots represent clinical data, and
the dashed line approximates the detection threshold or the lowest detectable leukemia level. Dots along this line indicate measurements of zero, meaning
the leukemia was undetectable within the limits of the assay. These ﬁgures correspond to patients 4 and 12 in Supplementary Table S2.

The multiplication factor b accounts for differences in mRNA
expression between BCR–ABL and the control gene. We multiply
by 100, in order to convert the ratio into a percentage when b ¼ 1
and a value between 0 and 100b otherwise.

Results
Many patients who otherwise respond well to therapy exhibit
oscillations in their BCR–ABL ratios. Of the 104 patients in our
dataset, only 15 showed monotonically decreasing BCR–ABL
ratios throughout therapy. Each of the remaining 89 patients
showed increases in BCR–ABL ratios in, on average, 28.82% of
their measurements. Two representative patients are shown
in Fig. 2. These ﬂuctuations occurred in many patients who
responded well to imatinib therapy and did not have any adverse
events. This lack of monotonicity in patients who responded well
to therapy motivated this study.
We applied our mathematical model, which is summarized
in Fig. 1, to the patient data in order to study these oscillations. As
previously mentioned, our model represents leukemic cells of
varying maturity and a single immune cell population. We
applied Latin hypercube sampling in order to determine the effect
of the drug (a10 and a20 ) and the immune parameters (m, dz, a, and
e). The parameters dz, a, and e determine the patient's immune
window [ymin, ymax], or the range of leukemia loads that will
stimulate a strong immune response. We deﬁne [ymin, ymax] by the
range of y3, for which the level of immune stimulation exceeds the
death rate. For each patient, we selected the parameter set that
minimizes the squared log distance between the patient data and

the results of the model simulation (sampled at the same time as
the data). All other parameters were held constant across all
patients; their values can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
The patient-speciﬁc parameter values are summarized in
Table 1. Figures 3 and 4 show representative ﬁts of our model to
patient data. (The patient-speciﬁc parameters producing these ﬁts
are provided in Supplementary Table S2.) Keeping in mind that
these ﬁts are plotted on a logarithmic scale, we see that our model is
able to reproduce many patients' dynamics during therapy.
The patient data and modeling results suggest that patients who
respond well to imatinib therapy go through three to four phases
of tumor reduction. During the ﬁrst few months, there is a rapid
exponential decline in BCR–ABL ratio. In our model, this effect is
due primarily to the action of the drug on the mature leukemic
population. The immune response is negligible at this stage
because the large leukemic load suppresses the immune system.
Beginning around month 6, there is a second, slower exponential
decline in BCR–ABL ratio. In some patients, the second phase is a
plateau in BCR–ABL ratio rather than a decline (see Fig. 3D). The
location of this plateau is determined primarily by the direct
effects of imatinib on the leukemic cell population (parameters
inh1 and inh2). This biphasic exponential decline has been previously observed in refs. 20, and 21. A few patients show a
triphasic exponential decline (Fig. 4B–D), which was discussed
in ref. 22. The duration of the biphasic or triphasic decline can
vary signiﬁcantly between patients, from the ﬁrst 2 years (Fig. 3A,
C, D, and F) to several years of therapy (Fig. 4B–D).
After this period of monotonic decline, many patients' leukemic loads begin to vary nonmonotonically. These ﬂuctuations are

often preceded by a sudden sharp decline in the leukemic population, as illustrated in Figs. 3F, 4B, D–F. If this effect is sufﬁciently strong, the leukemic stem cell population may be driven to
less than one cell, which we interpret as cure in our model.
Otherwise, the leukemic population is able to partially recover.
Several oscillations in both the leukemic and immune cell populations follow, with their amplitudes decreasing over time as the
populations approach an equilibrium, as seen in Fig. 5.

The patient-speciﬁc parameters are summarized in Table 1. Of
the six parameters varied, the ﬁts seem to be most sensitive to inh1
and inh2, followed by ymin and ymax. The parameters dz and m seem
to be less important. This is not surprising, as inh1 and inh2
determine the effect of the drug, and ymin and ymax determine at
what point the autologous immune response becomes signiﬁcant.

and the solid lines represent our simulations. Dashed lines show the BCR–ABL ratios that correspond to the ends of immune window, ymin and ymax. Dotted
lines approximate the minimum leukemic level that is detectable by quantitative RT-PCR. Dots along this line represent zero measurements, meaning CML cells
were not detected. These ﬁgures correspond to patients 7 to 12 in Supplementary Table S2.

The parameter values in Table 1 suggest that imatinib alone
results in a 3.5-log decrease in the total leukemia load, on average
(SD: 0.786, max: 5.158, min: 2.426). This effect is divided into a
2.5-log decrease in the proliferation of mature cells and a 1-log
decrease in the proliferation of progenitors. Each patient's
immune window covers approximately one order of magnitude
of leukemic populations, generally falling between 102.5 cells/mL

4058 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

and 106 cells/mL. We assume an initial mature leukemic population of 1.5(10)8 cells/mL. Thus, imatinib must decrease the
leukemia load by several orders of magnitude before the leukemia
enters the immune window and an immune response is initiated.
After the leukemic population enters this window, the leukemia
and immune populations oscillate, with the amplitude of oscillations decreasing over time.

Discussion
Despite the success of imatinib and other TKI therapies, many
questions about the underlying mechanisms of action remain.
Mathematical modeling is a complementary tool to clinical and
experimental data that can help us understand these mechanisms.
Several mathematical modeling groups have already studied
various aspects of CML (9, 20–26). We brieﬂy review some of
these contributions but note that a more thorough review can be
found in ref. 27.
Michor and colleagues (20) constructed an ordinary differential equations (ODE) model of CML that divides leukemic cells
into stem cells, progenitors, differentiated cells, and terminally
differentiated cells. Upon analyzing patients' initial responses to
imatinib therapy, they found that imatinib often leads to biphasic
exponential declines in the leukemic cell populations. Their
modeling results suggested that the ﬁrst, steeper decline represents
the action of imatinib on the differentiated leukemic cell population, while the second, slower decline represents an effect on the
leukemic progenitors. They later hypothesized that long-term
therapy leads to a triphasic exponential decline, where the third
decline may represent an effect on immature leukemic cells and
possibly leukemic stem cells (22).
On the other hand, Roeder and colleagues (21) developed an
agent-based model of CML that divides leukemic stem cells into
cycling and quiescent compartments. In their model, imatinib
results in the degradation and inhibition of cycling leukemic
stem cells while having no direct effect on quiescent leukemic

www.aacrjournals.org

stem cells. They interpreted the biphasic exponential decline
as an initial degradation effect, followed by a change in the
regulatory response of leukemic stem cells that produces
the second decline. A similar interpretation to the biphasic
decline is proposed in ref. 24.
Although these modeling frameworks are capable of reproducing the dynamics of some patients during therapy, both are
limited to those who show a monotonic decline in their leukemic
burdens. Neither model includes a mechanism that would allow
patients to show oscillations in leukemia load. However, in our
data, we found that many patients who respond well to imatinib
and achieve long-term remissions exhibit increases in leukemic
burden. The fact that the Michor and Roeder models are unable to
reproduce such oscillations suggests that there may be (an)
additional mechanism(s) that contribute(s) to patients' dynamics
during therapy.
Motivated by this, we developed a mathematical model that
integrates CML and an autologous immune response. As previously mentioned, there is strong evidence that the immune
system plays a role in the dynamics of CML (3–8, 15, 28, 29). In
our modeling framework, we deﬁned an immune window, or a
range of leukemic loads that will provoke a strong autologous
immune response. At diagnosis, the leukemic load is above this
window, and the large leukemic population is able to partially
or fully suppress the autologous immune system's response to
CML. Imatinib therapy generally reduces a patient's leukemic
load by several orders of magnitude, representing a signiﬁcant
reduction in immunosuppression. We hypothesize that imatinib may drive the leukemic population into the immune
window, allowing a patient's autologous immune system to
mount a response to CML.
In our model, oscillations in leukemic load occur after the
leukemia enters the immune window. Without the autologous
immune response, our model produces monotonically decreasing cancer loads, as seen in Supplementary Fig. S1. Once the
autologous immune cells have expanded sufﬁciently, they attack
the residual leukemic population. This ﬁrst attack by the autologous immune system results in the minimum detectable leukemic load achieved during imatinib therapy. However, because the
leukemia is driven below the immune window, the patient's
immune cell population begins to contract. If the leukemia is
not eradicated, it is able to rebound, until it reenters the immune
window, thus stimulating another weaker immune response. The
immune and leukemic cell populations continue to oscillate in
this way, with the amplitude of these oscillations decreasing over
time. Eventually, the oscillations dampen, and an equilibrium is
achieved between the leukemic and autologous immune cells.
Our modeling results suggest that oscillations in BCR–ABL ratio
during therapy may be partially explained by the patient's autologous immune response to the residual CML population.
Moreover, the oscillations may be a signature of the autologous immune response that can be used to characterize a
patient's individual immune system. This result is reminiscent
of previous tumor-immune models, for example, Kuznetsov
and colleagues (30).
On the basis of a patient's data over the course of TKI therapy,
we determine their immune proﬁle in the context of our model.
Each patient's immune proﬁle is different, as demonstrated by
differences in the immune windows and in the timing and
magnitude of the autologous immune response to CML. Our
modeling framework provides a potential tool to help quantify

(patient 4 in Supplementary Table S2). Red dots indicate worse ﬁts, and dark blue dots indicate better ﬁts. Here, we only show simulations that resulted in a
total cost of less than 10, where cost is the squared log distance between the patient data and model simulation. A, log(inh2) versus log(inh1). For this patient,
inhibition values satisfying log(inh1 inh2) in interval [2,4] were tested. These two parameters are strongly related to the quality of the ﬁt. B, log(m) versus
dz. These two parameters seem to be the least important, as it is difﬁcult to see any correlation between the ﬁt and either of these parameters. C, ymax versus ymin.
There is a deﬁnite relationship between the ﬁt and these two variables. The worse ﬁts tend to be in the upper left corner, while the better ﬁts tend to be in the lower
right corner. The parameters ymax and ymin determine the immune window and therefore affect the timing and magnitude of the autologous immune response.

these differences, which may play a signiﬁcant role in designing
personalized therapies or combination therapies aimed at further
reducing or eradicating the residual CML burden. This framework
will serve as a basis for future studies of treatment cessation and
personalized combination therapies consisting of TKIs and
immunotherapy.

Conclusion
The potentially signiﬁcant role of the immune system in the
dynamics of imatinib therapy suggests that immunotherapy may
help to eliminate the residual leukemic burden. In our simulations, when imatinib therapy drives the leukemia into the
immune window, an initially strong immune response occurs
that weakens over time. Eventually, the immune cell population
contracts, allowing the leukemia to partially recover. A combination of imatinib and immunotherapy may help to maintain a
strong immune response, to prevent such a recovery in the
leukemic population. As suggested in ref. 9, carefully timed
vaccines may stimulate the patient's immune system when the

4060 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

residual CML burden is no longer sufﬁcient. A sustained immune
response may result in a further decrease of the leukemic population and may even drive the leukemia to extinction. An optimal
vaccine schedule would depend heavily on each patient's immune
proﬁle, and our model offers a tool for characterizing this.
Although we focus on the autologous immune response as a
possible explanation of the oscillations that occur during imatinib
therapy, many other factors may contribute to this behavior. The
microenvironment of the leukemic cells is known to have a strong
inﬂuence on both healthy and leukemic cells (31, 32), but is not
included in our model. In addition, we do not account for patients
who do not properly or regularly take their drugs, which is known
to be an important factor (33). Moreover, for simplicity, we do not
distinguish between various subtypes of immune cells, each of
which may interact and play different roles in CML. Our model
can be expanded in order to achieve a more accurate representation of the autologous immune response to CML. We leave this for
a future work.
Still, the oscillations in patients' leukemic loads suggest an
additional mechanism during therapy that has not previously

been included in mathematical models. Our modeling results
support the hypothesis that the autologous immune system
contributes to the dynamics of imatinib therapy. If this is the
case, our model may serve as a valuable tool for characterizing a
patient's immune response to CML. This immune proﬁle may
then help in designing personalized combination therapies in
order to further control or eliminate the residual leukemic burden.
