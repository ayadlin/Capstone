ABSTRACT
Protein kinase inhibitors are widely used in chemotherapeutic cancer regimens.
Maleimide derivatives such as SB-216763 act as GSK-3 inhibitor targeting cell
proliferation, cell death and cell cycle progression.
Herein, the two arylindolylmaleimide derivatives PDA-66 and PDA-377 were
evaluated as potential chemotherapeutic agents on canine B-cell lymphoma cell
lines. Canine lymphoma represents a naturally occurring model closely resembling
the human high-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). PDA-66 showed more
pronounced effects on both cell lines. Application of 2.5µM PDA-66 resulted in a
significant induction of apoptosis (approx. 11 %), decrease of the metabolic activity
(approx. 95 %), anti-proliferative effect (approx. 85 %) and cell death within 48h.
Agent induced mode of action was characterized by whole transcriptome sequencing,
12 h and 24 h post-agent exposure. Key PDA-66-modulated pathways identified were
cell cycle, DNA replication and p53 signaling. Expression analyses indicated that the
drug acting mechanism is mediated through DNA replication and cycle arrest involving
the spindle assembly checkpoint.
In conclusion, both PDA derivatives displayed strong anti-proliferation
activity in canine B-cell lymphoma cells. The cell and molecular PDA-induced effect
characterization and the molecular characterization of the agent acting mechanism
provides the basis for further evaluation of a potential drug for canine lymphoma
serving as model for human NHL.

lymphoma, the canine tumor shows a higher incidence
with 13-33 cases per year in 100,000 dogs [4]. Concerning

lymphoma in dogs presents highly similar to human
high-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and thus
is considered to serve as a comparative animal model of
human NHL [2, 5].
Without treatment, most dogs suffering from
malignant lymphoma die within four to six weeks [6]. In
dogs, combination chemotherapy protocols are superior
in multicentric lymphoma and conventional CHOP-based
chemotherapy induces remission in approx. 80 % to 95 %
[3]. However, the majority of dogs undergoing chemotherapy
suffer disease recurrence within 12 months. Further, the
recurrent lymphoma cells are described to be highly resistant
to the initial chemotherapeutic protocol [7, 8].
Conventional chemotherapeutic protocols are
currently being completed by addition of inhibitory agents
targeting specific pathways e.g. GSK-3 or PI3K. These
pathways are reported to be altered in different neoplasias
such as leukemia [9, 10].
Arylindolylmaleimides are synthetic molecules,
consisting of a maleimide group conjugated to a bicyclic
indole ring and an additional aromatic or heterocyclic
component [11]. PDA-66 and PDA-377 are two
arylindolylmaleimides representing analogues of the
GSK-3-specific inhibitor SB-216763 characterized
by differences in their chemical substitutions [11, 12].
Application of PDA-66 to human acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) cell lines induced significant antiproliferative effects leading to apoptosis but did
not inhibit GSK-3 significantly at protein level
[11]. Previously, PDA-66 was reported to have a
depolymerizing effect on tubulin assembly in vitro
inducing microtubule destabilization in differentiated
human neural progenitor cells [12]. However, the effects
of PDA-66 and PDA-377 on lymphoma cells have not
been characterized before.
Aim of this study was to characterize the influence
of PDA-66 and PDA-377 on the two canine B-cell
lymphoma cell lines CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M at cellular
and molecular level. Due to the similarities in presentation
and biologic behavior of lymphomas in dogs and humans,
therapeutic protocols of these compounds in dogs could
bear high transfer potential to the human disease.

controls. Concentrations below 1.0 µM PDA-66 did not
show proliferation-inhibiting effects.
Application of 2.5 µM PDA-377 led to a significant
decrease in proliferation after 24 h and 48 h incubation in
CLBL-1, while CLBL-1M showed a significant decrease
in proliferation after 24 h and 72 h incubation. The CLBL1 and CLBL-1M cells treated with 0.5 µM and 1.0 µM
PDA-377 proliferated comparable to DMSO-treated
control cells (Figure 1a).
A significant dose-dependent effect of PDA-66 and
PDA-377 on the metabolic activity could be observed.
For both cell lines, PDA-66 showed a significant effect on
metabolism, as assessed by the water-soluble tetrazolium
(WST-1) assay. At ≥1.0 µM a decrease to ~ 55 - 75 %
(depending on time-point) was detected. In contrast, a
significant loss was not observed for PDA-377 before
increasing the concentration to 2.5 µM. At ≥2.5 µM a
loss of metabolic activity was observed after 24 h and
was sustained, with almost a complete loss from 48 h
onward, in both cell lines with both substances. The
detailed concentration/time courses are depicted in Figure
1b. Additional metabolic activity analyses showed that the
inhibitory effect of PDA-66 started at 1.5 µM after 48 h of
application and at 1.25 µM after 48 h of application (data
not shown).

PDA-66 and PDA-377 induce apoptosis and cell
death in canine B-cell lymphoma cell lines
The effect of PDA-66 and PDA-377 on apoptosis and
vitality was analyzed by Annexin V/PI staining 24 h, 48 h
and 72 h after PDA application. The distribution of early
apoptotic cells (Annexin+/PI-, Figure 2a) and late apoptotic/
dead cells (Annexin+/PI+, Figure 2b) was determined.
A significant increase of early apoptosis and late
apoptotic/dead cells was observed in both cell lines 24 h,
48 h and 72 h after exposure to 2.5 µM PDA-66. After 72
h the application of 2.5 µM PDA-66 late apoptotic/dead
cell rates reached 77.3% in CLBL-1 and 66.3 % CLBL1M. The early apoptotic induction by PDA-377 was less
pronounced than by PDA-66. A significant increase was
only observed in CLBL-1 cells at 48 h after treatment with
2.5 µM PDA-377. Although the amount of early apoptotic
cells in both cell lines increased 24 h after PDA-377
application, the differences to the control cells were not
significant. In both cell lines, a significant increase in late
apoptotic/dead cells up to 20.0 % was observed 72 h after
treatment with 2.5 µM PDA-377 (Supplementary Table 1).

PDA-66 and PDA-377 cause morphological
changes

PDA-66 demonstrated a strong effect on CLBL-1
and CLBL-1M proliferation. The incubation of CLBL1 and CLBL-1M with 2.5 µM PDA-66 resulted in a
significant decrease in cell count, since cells did not
proliferate over the incubation period of 72 h. Cells
exposed to 1.0 µM PDA-66 proliferated slower in
comparison to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-exposed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To verify possible morphological changes
caused by PDA-66 and PDA-377, cells were exposed
to concentrations ranging from 0.25 µM to 10 µM
for 72 h and analyzed by performing life cell imaging.
Additionally, cells were treated with 1.5 μM of PDA-66

and 2.5 µM of PDA-377 for 72 h and analyzed by light
microscopy after Pappenheim staining.
The two B-cell lymphoma cell lines showed similar
morphological changes after PDA application compared to
DMSO-treated control cells. Starting at a concentration of
2.5 µM for both PDA derivatives, decreasing cell numbers
and an increasing amount of cellular debris and spherically
shaped, smaller cells could be observed in contrast to
DMSO-exposed cells. With increasing incubation time,
the effects on morphology caused by PDA-66 and PDA377 became more distinct (Supplementary Videos). By
Pappenheim staining, the PDA-treated cells exhibited
an apoptotic phenomenon. Formation of cytoplasmic
blebbing, light to dark blue cytoplasm showing,
beside juxtanuclear enlightenment, also distinct large
vacuolization, clumped condensed chromatin patterns of
round to indented and clover-leaf-shaped nuclei, apoptotic
bodies and mitotic figures could be observed in analyzed
cells (Figure 3).

pronounced in the CLBL-1M cells at both time points
(Table 2). The response after 12 h did not reach statistical
significance for any transcript, when CLBL-1 and CLBL1M were compared, suggesting that the early effects of
PDA-66 are similar in both cell lines.
Nevertheless, the comparison of the high-dose.24
h groups yielded 1703 genes that react differently
between the two cell lines. Most significantly
overrepresented genes in this set are ribosomal proteins,
which are transcribed at higher levels in CLBL-1M
compared to CLBL-1 cells (corrected for control levels).
Significantly deregulated pathways in the high-dose.24
h treatment groups compared to the DMSO exposed
controls identified by KEGG analyses are given in
Table 3.

Transcriptomic analyses of PDA-66-treated
CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M cells

The early effects (12 h) of PDA-66 involved
deregulation of 170 genes in CLBL-1 cells and 235
genes in CLBL-1M cells. Both 12h.high-dose treatment
groups showed highly significant enrichment of genes
mapping to the KEGG pathways: cell cycle, DNA
replication and p53 signaling (Table 4). The foldchanges of the early affected genes in these pathways are
displayed as heatmaps for all four high-dose treatment
groups in Figure 5 and show consistent directions of
changes in the 12 h treatment groups. An overview of
this drug-induced gene regulation in the context of the
mammalian cell cycle is displayed in Figure 6. The
results of the transcriptome analysis suggest a cell cycle
arrest putatively in late M-phase, likely involving the
spindle assembly checkpoint.

Early deregulated genes and associated
pathways

The multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot of the
RNAseq data is given in Figure 4. The high-dose.24 h
treatment groups of both cell lines form clearly separated
clusters (Cluster A and B), whereas the difference of
the high-dose.12 h treatment groups is less pronounced
(Cluster C and D). The low-dose treatments did not form
clusters separate from the DMSO controls. The lower
response to the low-dose treatment is also reflected by
the low numbers of differentially expressed genes (FDR
< 0.001) (Table 2).
The high-dose treatment resulted in higher numbers
of differentially expressed genes, which was more

DISCUSSION

apoptosis of 10 % was observed at 24 h post 2.5 µM
PDA-66 application. Although inhibitory effects of 1.0
µM PDA-66 on cell proliferation and metabolic activity
were also observed, the cells maintained a comparable
growth rate to DMSO-treated control. Previous studies on
human ALL cell lines have shown a significant inhibition
of proliferation starting at a concentration of 0.5 μM PDA66 [11]. In the ReNcell VM human neural progenitor cell
line (hNPC), proliferation can be stopped by application
of 3 µM PDA-66 while human neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y) with an IC50 of 8.48 µM and lung cancer cells
(A549) with an IC50 of 4.97 µM were less sensitive to
PDA-66 [12].
Comparative transcriptome analysis was performed
for the more potent compound (PDA-66) at 12 h and
24 h post application of dosages of 1.0 µM and 2.5
µM. Low-dose-treated groups did not show major gene
expression differences compared to controls while highdose application induced distinct effects. Early modulated
genes and pathways (12 h PDA-66 high-dose) mapped to

Herein, the effects of PDA-66 and PDA-377 on
canine lymphoma cell lines were investigated for the
first time. Different dosages and incubation times were
compared to DMSO-treated control cultures. The DMSO
concentration (≤ 0.1 %) in the control groups was chosen
to be equivalent to the highest DMSO concentration of the
PDA group in order to compensate for putative solvent
effects. Nevertheless, such low concentrations of DMSO
are described to cause no cell toxicity [13, 14].
Consistent with previous findings, PDA-66 and
PDA-377 led to a significant decrease in cell count,
metabolic activity, and induced anti-proliferative effects in
canine B-cell lymphoma cells. Furthermore, an induction
of apoptosis and late apoptotic/dead cells was detected in
the exposed lymphoma cells. Compared with PDA-377,
PDA-66 showed a stronger cytotoxic effect inducing
death of all lymphoma cells after 48 h at a concentration
of 2.5 µM. In fact, inhibition to 70 % proliferation and

three main pathways: cell cycle, DNA replication and p53
signaling pathway. However, the gene sets assigned to the
p53 and cell cycle pathway largely overlap. The effect
of PDA-66 on cell cycle and DNA replication was more
pronounced at 24 h, indicating a time-dependent effect in
both cell lines. Minor differences in transcript abundance
of ribosomal proteins were detected between the CLBL-1
and CLBL-1M 24 h high-dose groups. The deregulated
pathways (Table 3) showed slightly different levels of
significance. These observed subtle differences only seen

caused by clonal selection as the cell line CLBL-1M was
generated by in vivo inoculation of CLBL-1. However, the
general response of both cell lines and the major addressed
pathways are comparable indicating a common acting
mechanism of the compounds.
Expression analyses showed that especially genes,
for which peak transcription is described in late G2/M
phase are significantly elevated in the treated cells, while
G1 and S-phase-associated genes were significantly
depleted (Figure 6) [15]. This observation strongly
suggests that PDA-66 induces a cell cycle block, which

arrests the cells and ultimately leads to apoptosis. Three
cell cycle checkpoints are known in mammalian cells:
the G1 checkpoint, the G2-M DNA damage response
checkpoint (DDR) and the spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC). Though our RNAseq data clearly excluded
an arrest at G1 phase, we detected the transcriptional
enrichment of genes related to both DDR and SAC. While
the enrichment of TP53I3 (tumor protein p53 inducible
protein) transcripts points to an activation of TP53
mediated DDR, the enriched MAD2, CDC20 and BUB1B
transcripts represent key components of the SAC [16, 17].
Interestingly, significant differential transcript
abundance for tubulin isoforms was solely detected in
the 24 h treatment groups, and different isoforms showed
different directions of change (Figure 6 insert). It has been
described previously that PDA-66 has a depolymerizing
effect on tubulin assembly in vitro and acts as microtubuledestabilizing agent by its indole core [12]. Furthermore,
an autoregulatory mechanism of tubulin transcription
has been proposed whereby tubulin mRNA expression/
stability is negatively regulated by soluble unpolymerized
tubulin dimers accumulating within the cell [18]. Taken
together the enrichment of G2/M phase-specific transcripts
and the later perturbation of tubulin isoform expression
suggest a cell cycle arrest at the SAC rather than DDR.
Such a SAC arrest was recently also reported on a different
indole-containing anti-cancer agent [19].
In conclusion, we have shown that PDA-66 as well
as PDA-377 significantly inhibit the proliferation and
metabolic activity of two canine lymphoma cell lines and
induce apoptosis as previously demonstrated for human
neuroblastoma, lung carcinoma and ALL cells, also with
dose-dependent G2 arrest [11, 12]. Our results show that
PDA-66 possesses potential anti-cancer activity through
SAC activation.
The characterization of PDA-induced effects on
canine lymphoma cells provides a basis for further in
vivo studies. Early pharmacokinetic studies in mice
revealed that i.p. application of 100 mg/kg PDA-66 once
daily was well tolerated. One hour after injection plasma
concentrations between 4 and 7 µmol/L were achieved
rapidly decreasing exponentially to nearly zero after five
hours (data not shown).
However, an application in dogs with spontaneously
occurring lymphoma could allow evaluating the compound
in presence of an immune system. Consequently, single
or combination therapy with PDA-66 in dogs can provide
valuable information before compound testing in humans.

The substances were dissolved in DMSO
(AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany). The stock solutions
(10 mM) were stored at -20°C. For experimental use the
drugs were freshly prepared from stock solution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M cells were seeded at a
density of 1×106 cells in 3 ml of cell culture medium in
12-well plates. Cells were treated with 0.025 % DMSO,
0.5 µM, 1.0 µM and 2.5 µM PDA-66 and PDA-377,
respectively. The number of viable cells was determined
24 h, 48 h and 72 h after DMSO, PDA-66 and PDA-377
treatment by trypan blue staining using a hemocytometer.
Experiments were performed in biological triplicates.

Cell lines and culture condition
Two canine B-cell lymphoma cell lines named CLBL1 and CLBL-1M established by the authors were used.
CLBL-1 was derived from a fine needle aspirate of an 8
year-old Bernese Mountain Dog with stage IV diffuse large
cell lymphoma [5]. The daughter cell line CLBL-1M was
generated by injecting CLBL-1 cells into Rag2-/-γc-/-mice.
The emerging tumorous material was isolated, cultivated and
the lymphoma cell line was established. CLBL-1M allowed
characterizing the influence of in vivo inoculation of CLBL1 cells evaluating the stability and comparability of CLBL1-generated in vitro and in vivo models. Comparison of flow
cytometric, cellular, molecular and chromosomal markers
revealed strong conservative character of both cell lines
[20]. Additional, comparative genomic sequencing revealed
high genomic stability with one exception, a focal deletion
at CFA32: 5Mbp-7.5Mbp which is exclusively present in
CLBL-1 (unpublished data).
CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M cells were cultivated
in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany)
supplemented with 20 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Biochrom) and 2 % penicillin/streptomycin
(Biochrom) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 %
CO2 in T75-tissue culture flasks placed in upright position
(TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland).

WST-1 proliferation assay
CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M cells were seeded at a
density of 5 x 104 cells/well in 96-well plates with 150 µl
cell culture medium containing different concentrations of
PDA-66 and PDA-377 (0.25 - 10 μM). Control cells were
cultured in medium containing 0.1 % (v/v) of DMSO.
Cells treated with each PDA concentration were plated in
four replicates. All cells were incubated for 24 h, 48 h and
72 h. The WST-1 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) analysis
was performed as described before [11]. The absorbance
at 450 nm and a reference wavelength at 620 nm were
determined using the Multi-Mode Reader Synergy 2
(BioTek Instruments, VT, USA).

Transcriptomic analyses
Due to the more pronounced effect of PDA-66 at
cellular level, the transcriptome characterization was only
performed for PDA-66.
CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M cells were treated with
0.025 % DMSO, 1.0 μM (low-dose) and 2.5 µM (highdose) PDA-66. At 12 h and 24 h, cells were harvested
and total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Sample names are shown in
Table  1. Each treatment condition was prepared and
sequenced in triplicates. For the preparation of sequencing
libraries, 2 µg total RNA with RNA integrity numbers
> 8 were used. Poly-A RNA was enriched and ligated
to sequencing adapter using the NEBNext Ultra RNA
preparation Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Sequencing
was conducted on an Illumina NextSeq500 (Illumina, San
Diego, USA) as single reads with 75 bp length. A total
of 480 million reads were generated, which were mapped
to the canine genome (Broad CanFam3.1/canFam3, Sep.
2011) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [21].
Read counts were generated for annotated genes (EMBL
gene ID nomenclature) using the R package GAGE [22].
Annotations referring to non-protein coding RNAs were
censored from the final read count list.

Apoptosis and late apoptotic/dead cell were
analyzed by staining with Annexin V FITC (BD
Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) and Propidium iodide
(PI) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The apoptosis and late apoptotic/
dead cells rates were determined by flow cytometry
using a FACSCaliburTM (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany).
After cell count analysis, 1 x 106 CLBL-1 and
CLBL-1M cells were harvested and washed twice (185
xg, 10 min, 4°C) with PBS, then resuspended in 100 μl
of Annexin binding buffer (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany). Five μl of Annexin V FITC were added
and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cell
suspensions were adjusted to a final volume of 500 μl
with binding buffer and stained with PI (0.6 μg/ml)
immediately before measurement. Unstained and single
stained cells (0.025 % DMSO-treated) were included
in each experiment as controls. The gained data were
analyzed using BD CellQuest software (BD Biosciences,
Heidelberg, Germany).

Live cell imaging
CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M cells were seeded at a
density of 5 x 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate with 150
µl cell culture medium and treated with 0.1 % DMSO and
different concentrations of PDA-66 and PDA-377 (0.25
- 10 μM). Cells treated with each PDA concentration
were plated with three biological replicates. The imaging
was performed for 96 h with PDA treatment at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 using the Leica
DMI6000 B Inverted Microscope (Leica Microsystems,
Wetzlar, Germany). Simultaneously, a picture of each
attempt was captured every 15 min during the whole
incubation time and single pictures were combined to a
Live cell imaging video.

Bioinformatic analyses and statistics
Significant differences of metabolic activity between
treatment and the DMSO control were calculated using
Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. The statistical
analyses of cell count and apoptosis/necrosis were done
using student’s t-test (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA).
Results are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Differences were considered statistically significant if *
p< 0.05.
Differential gene expression analysis from RNAseq
data was conducted using the BioconductorR package
edgeR [23]. Genes with less than 1 read count per million
in more than 18 samples were censored. On average 4.5
million (STDEV: 745,000) mapped reads per sample were
used for differential gene expression analyses. Each cell
line/treatment group (n=3) was compared to the respective
mock-treated (DMSO) control cells (n=3). Treatment
groups were high-dose.12 h, high-dose.24 h, low-dose.12
h, low-dose.24 h. After multidimensional scaling and
plotting of the data one CLBL-1 DMSO-treated control
sample was identified as outlier and was censored, so
that the CLBL-1-12h-DMSO group consisted of only
two independent samples. In addition to the comparison
of each treatment group within the two cell lines, genes
that responded differently to 12 h and 24 h high-dose
treatment in CLBL1 versus CLBL-1M were identified

Pappenheim staining
Cells were treated with DMSO, 1.5 μM PDA-66
and 2.5 µM PDA-377 for 72 h. Glass slides were prepared
with 5 x 104 cells with Cytospin 3 centrifuge (Shandon,
Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Briefly, slides were stained
in May-Grünwald working solution (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) for 6 min, rinsed with tap water, then stained
20 min in Giemsa working solution (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) and rinsed thoroughly with tap water. The slides
were air dried at room temperature before analysis. To
evaluate morphological changes of the cells slides were
analyzed by EVOS® XL Core Imaging System (AMG,
Washington, USA).
