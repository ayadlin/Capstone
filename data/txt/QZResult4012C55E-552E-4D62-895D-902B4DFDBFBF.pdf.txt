BACKGROUND. Acute urinary retention is a potential complication of brachytherapy, with the literature estimating that 5% to 22% of patients require catheterization within 48 hours after implantation. In theory, postimplantation edema could
be reduced by using intraoperative steroids. A prospective trial was conducted
randomizing patients to a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone versus no
steroid use.

METHODS. In all, 196 evaluable patients who received iodine-125 (I125) interstitial
brachytherapy alone as definitive treatment for low-to-intermediate risk prostate

need for catheterization was reported.

RESULTS. Between 2003 and 2005, 99 patients received steroids on treatment
Arm A and 97 patients were treated according to control Arm B. Treatment arms
were balanced with respect to pretreatment characteristics. A total of 3 patients
required catheterization (2 in Arm A and 1 in Arm B). The overall rate of catheterization was 1.5%, with no statistically significant difference noted between
treatment arms. The 3 patients requiring catheterization had no statistical differences from other patients with respect to pretreatment characteristics, number of
seeds/needles used, or postimplantation computed tomography volume of the
prostate.

CONCLUSIONS. There was no statistically significant difference noted between
treatment arms in the current study, leading the authors to conclude that intraoperative dexamethasone did not decrease the rate of catheterization required
after brachytherapy. The overall rate of postimplantation catheterization in the
current study was 1.5%, which is lower than reported elsewhere in the literature
and in a retrospective review from the study institution. Cancer 2008;113:2605–

Acute urinary morbidity requiring catheterization
is a known complication of prostate brachytherapy.
The rate of catheterization within 48 hours of
brachytherapy has been quoted in multiple series in
the literature to be between 5% and 22%. Factors
contributing to increased acute urinary obstructive
symptoms have also been cited in the literature and
include baseline International Prostate Symptom
Score (IPSS) score, baseline prostate volume, a history of diabetes, surgeon learning curve, and amount
of postimplantation edema as assessed by the ratio
of postimplantation computed tomography (CT) to
planning ultrasound (US) target volume.3-12
Theoretically, the use of dexamethasone perioperatively could decrease postimplantation edema. A
retrospective review of 200 patients at our institution
demonstrated a 10% incidence of postoperative need
for catheterization in patients between 1992 and
1998 without the use of steroids. After a change in
institutional policy, all patients received intraoperative steroids, and a 2% rate of catheterization was
noted between 1998 and 2002.13
We conducted a prospective, single-institution,
randomized trial in 204 patients to determine the effect
of intraoperative dexamethasone on the rate of postimplantation catheterization. The effect of steroids on
postimplantation edema and prostate volume was also
evaluated through retrospective review of preimplantation US volumes and postimplantation CT scans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 2003 through 2005, 204 patients were treated
on protocol with iodine-125 (125I) interstitial, lowdose-rate prostate implantation alone as definitive
treatment for low-to-intermediate risk prostate cancer at the University of Cincinnati. All patients had
histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1c-T2a disease, N0, a Gleason
score of 6 to 7, and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
level <20 ng/dL (pretreatment characteristics are
listed in Table 1). Patients were excluded for any history of pelvic radiotherapy, radiographic evidence of
pelvic lymph node involvement (N1), clinical/radiographic evidence of metastatic disease (M1), or current use of adrenocortical steroid therapy. No patient
received preimplantation hormonal therapy.
After providing informed consent, patients completed a baseline IPSS questionnaire. Pretreatment
characteristics were recorded for analysis, including
patient age, Karnofsky performance status, clinical
stage, Gleason score, PSA level, number of seeds
used, number of needles used in implantation, preimplantation prostate volume by US, total activity of

implant, and the use of pretreatment a-blockers.
Patients were excluded from definitive brachytherapy
for any IPSS >18. Patients were then stratified by
IPSS score (1-9 or 10-18) and the use of pretreatment
a-blockers, and were then randomized preoperatively
to receive dexamethasone at dose of 6 mg administered intravenously in a single intraoperative dose or
no steroids.
Implants were performed by 2 radiation oncologists. Preoperative planning target volumes were
determined by US according to American Brachytherapy Society recommendations and represented
the volume of the prostate only (no margin). A minimal peripheral dose of 14.4 gray (Gy) was prescribed
to the periphery of the prostate per TG-43 protocol.
Seed activity ranged from 0.357 to 0.68 millicuries
(mCi). A modified peripheral needle loading pattern
was used. A Foley catheter was placed intraoperatively and removed when distal extremity neurologic
function returned to baseline after spinal or general
anesthesia (median time of 60 minutes after the
completion of procedure). Fluoroscopy was used to
confirm needle placement. All patients underwent
postimplantation CT scan with 3-mm slice thickness
on postoperative Day 0 or 1 for postimplantation dosimetry. Postimplantation prostate volumes were
contoured on axial CT slices by 1 of 2 investigators.
All patients received tamsulosin at a dose of 0.4
mg daily on the operative and first postoperative
days. Patients were contacted by telephone 48 to 72
hours after implantation and the need for catheterization was reported. All medical records were
obtained for patients requiring catheterization outside the treating radiation oncologist’s office.

On the basis of our retrospective data, an accrual
goal of 200 patients was set to have 85% power in
detecting a 10% decrease in the rate of catheterization with the addition of intraoperative steroids.
Pooled Student t test and logistic regression were
performed for statistical comparison of the group
receiving steroids and the control group with regard
to pretreatment characteristics. These tests were also
used for comparison of patients requiring catheterization to those not catheterized.

RESULTS
In all, 196 of 204 patients were evaluable. Eight patients
were excluded because of refusal of brachytherapy after
study consent (2 patients), lack of follow-up (1 patient),
positive toxicology screen and brachytherapy not
performed (1 patient), patient noncompliance with
tamsulosin (2 patients), or incorrect administration of
steroid dose by anesthesiologist/investigator (2
patients). Ninety-nine patients received intraoperative
steroids and 97 patients were treated according to the
control arm. Pretreatment characteristics were not
found to be statistically different between the 2 groups
(Table 1). There was a trend toward a higher Gleason
score in the control group (P 5.06).
Three patients in total required catheterization
for an overall rate of 1.5%. Two patients in the steroid group and 1 patient in the control arm were
catheterized. The mean time to catheter placement
was 36 hours and the mean duration of catheterization was 24 days. No patient required surgical intervention to relieve urinary obstruction. Each of the 3
patients was placed on a-blockers until the obstruction resolved, and no patient required long-term
catheterization (>45 days).
The pretreatment characteristics of patients
requiring catheterization were quite variable and are
shown in Table 2. Comparison of the mean pretreatment characteristic values between the patients who
were catheterized and those not requiring catheterization yielded no statistically significant difference,

as demonstrated in Table 3. There was a trend toward a
larger prostate volume in patients requiring catheterization because of a single high value, but we have no
statistical reason to expect other patients with similarly
large volumes would require catheterization.
When preimplantation dosimetry and postimplantation CT volumes were analyzed, there was no
significant difference noted between patients receiving steroids and the control group, nor between
catheterized and noncatheterized patients. The average D90 in the group receiving steroids was 142 Gy
and was 140 Gy in the nonsteroid group, with no statistical difference between the groups. The ratio of
postimplantation CT volume to preimplantation US
volume was analyzed in each patient and the average
volume increase on postoperative CT scan was 20%.
Again, no significant difference was noted in this
ratio between the steroid group and the control arm,
concluding that intraoperative steroid use did not
decrease short-term postimplantation edema. In
addition, there was no significant difference noted
with regard to the CT:US ratio between catheterized
and noncatheterized patients (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
The overall catheterization rate of 1.5% noted in the
current study was lower than expected based on

retrospective data from the literature and from our
institution. Stock et al5 reported a review of 251
patients in 1998 with a 6% rate of catheterization.
The Brigham and Women’s group reported a 12%
incidence of postimplantation catheterization and
Bucci et al reported a 15% catheterization rate in 282
patients in Vancouver, British Columbia.4,15 Ohio
State University reported 15% of patients requiring
catheterization in 2000, with a higher IPSS score
found to correlate with increased rates of acute urinary obstruction.8 Sacco et al9 reported on the Massachusetts General Hospital retrospective experience
of 400 patients, demonstrating an 8% catheterization
rate in patients receiving perioperative steroids and
18% in patients treated without steroids. On multivariate analysis, the use of steroids and prostate volume at the time of diagnosis emerged as significant
predictors of acute urinary obstruction at their institution. At the University of Cincinnati from 1992
until present, our catheterization rate within 48
hours has decreased from 10% to 1.5%. There are
several hypotheses that can be generated from this
low catheterization rate.
Our decrease in catheterization rates over time
may represent an institutional learning curve, which
has also been reported in other institutions. Keyes
et al6 noted a decrease in their catheterization rate
from 17% to 6.3% between 1998 and 2002. Speight
et al3 cited an improvement in postimplantation dosimetry based on changes in needle placement over
time at the University of California at San Francisco.
All implants were performed by 2 radiation oncologists at our institution between 1992 and the present.
This protocol was offered to all patients who were eligible for definitive prostate brachytherapy between
2003 and 2005 within our institution, and very few
patients refused. The patients treated on this protocol represent the vast majority of patients who were
treated with brachytherapy alone for prostate cancer
during that timeframe at our institution. Although it

may be helpful to compare these patients with those
treated off protocol during the same period, this
would not be possible because of low patient numbers for comparison.
The timeframe of acute urinary obstruction and
the need for catheterization after 125I brachytherapy
points to a traumatic rather than radiation cause for
edema, because the dose delivered by 48 hours after
implantation is not significant. The relation between
a high number of periurethral needle manipulations
in prostate brachytherapy implantation has been
positively correlated in the literature with acute urinary toxicity by Eapen et al.15 In addition, in the
Vancouver experience, the number of needles used
per implant emerged as being predictive of acute urinary morbidity on univariate analysis.4 The mean
number of needles used per implant in the current
study was 17. Other institutions have reported
between 15 to 33 needles used per implant.
No patient in the current study received pretreatment hormonal therapy. Within the literature,
patients requiring hormonal therapy to decrease
prostate size have had high rates of acute urinary
morbidity in comparison with patients with a similar
prostate volume who did not require hormones.5,9
Patients in our trial were also prescreened for
brachytherapy on the basis of their baseline urinary
function. The mean IPSS score before therapy was 9.
A high IPSS score has emerged on multivariate analysis in the literature as being predictive of higher rates
of catheterization and acute urinary obstructive
symptoms.4,5,8
In addition, all patients enrolled in this trial
received perioperative tamsulosin. The use of secondgeneration and third-generation a-blocker medications has been associated with a significant improvement in urinary obstructive symptoms since their
availability in the late 1990s. Patients previously treated
at our institution and included in our retrospective
data who demonstrated a 10% catheterization rate had
not routinely been treated with a-blockers.
Merrick et al16 previously conducted a small trial
of 22 patients who were randomized to either preoperative dexamethasone or a control group. They
found no difference in the short-term catheterization
rate, dosimetric quality, Day 0/Day 28 prostate volume, or clinical outcomes between the 2 groups. We
have now conducted a larger randomized trial powered to detect a 10% improvement in the catheterization rate, which confirms the lack of improvement in
the catheterization rate noted with the addition of
dexamethasone. In addition, our experience did not
demonstrate a decrease in postimplantation edema
on postoperative CT scan in patients receiving dexa-

methasone. Therefore, it is our opinion that dexamethasone should not be routinely be prescribed for
this purpose.
