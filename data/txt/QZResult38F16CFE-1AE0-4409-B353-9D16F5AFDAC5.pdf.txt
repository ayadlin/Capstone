ABSTRACT
MELK is upregulated in various types of human cancer and is known to be
associated with cancer progression, maintenance of stemness, and poor prognosis.
OTS167, a MELK kinase inhibitor, shows potent growth-suppressive effect on human
tumors in a xenograft model, but the detailed mode of action has not been fully
elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of action of MELK
inhibitor OTS167 in a preclinical model. OTS167-treated cells caused morphological
transformation, induced the differentiation markers, and reduced stem-cell marker
expression. Furthermore, we identified DEPDC1, known as an oncogene, as an
additional downstream molecule of the MELK signaling pathway. MELK enhanced
DEPDC1 phosphorylation and its stability. The expression of MELK and downstream
molecules was decreased in OTS167-treated xenograft tumor tissues, which revealed
central necrosis and significant growth suppression. Our data should further shed
light on the mechanism of action how OTS167 suppresses tumor growth through the
inhibition of the MELK signaling pathway and suggest the possibility of biomarkers
for the assessment of clinical efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

also associated with therapeutic resistance and poor
prognosis [9, 12, 13]. To date, several proteins were
identified as substrates or downstream molecules of the
MELK pathway [6, 14, 15]. Through the analysis of
MELK itself and these molecules, MELK was shown
to be involved in many aspects of cancer traits, such
as cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis and cell invasion.
Furthermore, recent studies revealed upregulation of
MELK in cancer stem cells and indicated MELK as a
potential marker for cancer stem cells [15, 16]. Since
targeting MELK alone or with other treatment modalities
has a possibility to overcome therapeutic resistance
by suppressing CSCs as well as cancer proliferation,
many efforts have been paid to develop a MELK kinase
inhibitor(s) [14, 17].
OTS167 was developed as a novel potent and
selective MELK kinase inhibitor with strong antitumor
activity in both solid and hematological cancers [11, 14],
and is currently conducted a first-in-human clinical trial
in solid tumor. Unlike the conventional chemotherapy,

Cancer is the second most common cause of death in
US in 2015 [1] and has been the leading cause of death in
Japan since 1981[2]. Despite of the improvement in cancer
treatment modalities, clinical outcome for some cancers
such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic
cancer and small cell lung cancer are still lagging behind
others [3-5]. Although it causes severe adverse drug
reactions, conventional chemotherapy is still the best
therapeutic option and standard of care for these patients.
Thus, the development of novel targeted therapeutics for
these cancers are urgently needed.
We previously reported MELK (maternal embryonic
leucine zipper kinase) as a potential and promising
molecular target for development of novel cancer therapy
[6]. Elevated MELK expression was reported in various
types of human cancer [6-10] including hematological
malignancies [11] with hardly detectable expression in
normal organs except the testis. MELK expression was

the use of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
measurement of bulk tumor volume are not always
appropriate for the clinical evaluation of molecular
targeted drugs [18]. To optimize and personalize the
dosing for targeted agents, detailed molecular pathway
and biomarkers that were affected by the drug should be
elucidated.
In this study, we report the molecular mechanism
of action of OTS167 in a cancer xenograft model. We
demonstrate that OTS167-treated cancer cells or tumor
tissues reduce MELK protein levels and a proliferation
marker Ki67. Furthermore, we report DEPDC1 as a novel
downstream molecule in the MELK-signaling pathway
and that FOXM1, p21, Slug and Snail as well as DEPDC1
expression levels are affected by OTS167. These results
support our therapeutic concept that OTS167 suppresses
tumor growth through the inhibition of MELK pathway
and imply that molecular changes in the MELK-signaling
molecules might serve as biomarkers for treatment with a
MELK inhibitor OTS167.

Suppression of MELK induces cell morphological
change
To elucidate biological function of MELK, we
treated cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer cell
line) and A549 (lung cancer cell line), in which MELK
was highly expressed, with a MELK inhibitor OTS167,
and examined morphological changes of these cancer
cells. As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, the morphology of
MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells was drastically changed
within 24 hours after the treatment with OTS167 even at
10-nM concentration. The cells appeared to be elongated
in cytoplasmic projection. These morphological changes
were also observed in other MELK-overexpressing cancer
cells when they were treated with 20 nM of OTS167
for 24 hours (Supplementary Figure S1). Concordantly,
the similar morphological changes were observed in

MELK knocked-down cells (Supplementary Figure S2),
supporting that these changes are likely to be caused
through MELK suppression. Although no significant
difference in the number of cells between the control
and OTS167-treated groups was observed at this time
point (Figure 1C and 1D), we found strong p53 and p21
induction in A549 cells with wild-type p53 (Figure 1E).
Unexpectedly, although the level of p21 was higher in
p53-wild-type A549 cells than in p53-mutated MDAMB-231 cells, p21 protein was also increased in p53mutant MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that induction
of p21 seems to occur through the suppression of
MELK activity regardless to the p53 status (Figure 1E).
Interestingly, cancer cells with p53 wild-type showed
relatively higher sensitivity to OTS167 than p53-mutant
cells (Supplementary Figure S3, p = 0.04).

We previously reported that MELK enhanced cell
invasiveness through activation of DBNL [14], which is
involved in the Rac/JNK signaling pathway [19]. Hence,
we hypothesized that a part of MELK biological functions
could be explained through its involvement in a small
GTPase-signaling pathway. As DEPDC1 contains a RhoGAP domain and is also upregulated in various types of
human cancer, we investigated the relationship between
MELK and DEPDC1, and found that the expression
levels of MELK and DEPDC1 was strongly correlated
in breast cancers as shown in Supplementary Figure
S4A (Pearson’s r = 0.6). We then examined DEPDC1
and MELK protein levels in cells treated with siRNA
targeting MELK or DEPDC1. In MELK knocked-down
cells, DEPDC1 protein level was significantly reduced
without any change at the transcriptional level. On the
other hand, no change was observed in MELK mRNA

or protein level in the cells treated with siDEPDC1
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S4B). We further
performed an in vivo phosphorylation assay to examine
phosphorylation status of DEPDC1. As shown in Figure
2B, DEPDC1 phosphorylation was enhanced in cells in
which wild-type MELK was introduced, compared with
cells transfected with control mock or kinase-dead MELK

(D150A) vector. DEPDC1 phosphorylation was confirmed
by disappearance of this band with phosphatase treatment
(Figure 2B). These results have suggested that MELK
is upstream of DEPDC1 and regulates DEPDC1 protein
stability through its phosphorylation.

autophosphorylation by OTS167 occurs, MELK protein
is degraded rapidly (Figures 1E and 2C). Since MDAMB-231 cells have an undifferentiated, cancer stem-like

as Snail2), in OTS167-treated cells by western blot
analysis, and found that Slug protein level was reduced
with OTS167 treatment in a dose-dependent manner as
similar to the MELK and DEPDC1 reduction (Figure 2C).
Because Slug is also known to negatively regulate the
E-cadherin expression, we examined E-cadherin protein
level and confirmed its induction by the MELK inhibition
in an OTS167 dose-dependent manner. These results
indicated that MELK suppression reduced cancer stem cell
population and might induce cell differentiation.

xenograft mice, tumor suppressive effect of OTS167 was
not as strong as that against A549 cells, but modest levels
of growth suppressive effect was observed at the doses of
12 and 25 mg/kg with TGI of 51 and 66 %, respectively
(Figure 3C). To further elucidate the cellular and molecular
changes in OTS167-treated tumor tissues, we collected
xenograft tissues on day 4, 11, and 18, and performed
western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis.
H&E staining of tumor tissues clearly revealed massive
central necrosis even in an early time-point (day 4) after
the treatment as shown in Figure 3D and Supplementary
Figure S5. Necrotic areas became larger in an OTS167
dose-dependent manner, suggesting OTS167 induces early
intratumoral changes without decrease in tumor volume.
The administration of OTS167 was well tolerated in
xenograft model without any significant toxicity and body
weight loss (Supplementary Figure S7).

OTS167 strongly induces antitumor activity in

We further performed animal xenograft experiments
to examine the correlation between pharmacological effect
and biomarker changes. A549 lung cancer cells or MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells were inoculated into mice.
After tumor sizes reached an average volume of 200
mm3, OTS167 or vehicle was administered intravenously
twice a week for 3 weeks (Figure 3A). Tumor growth was
significantly suppressed in the OTS167-treatment group
of the A549 model in a dose-dependent manner. Tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) in the group treated with 2, 12,
or 25 mg/kg of OTS167 in A549 xenograft mice was 27,
88, and 117%, respectively (Figure 3B). In MDA-MB-231

showed significant decrease of MELK protein (Figure
4A and Supplementary Figure S6A). Concordantly,
immunohistochemical analysis showed decrease of MELK
protein; the proportion of an area with MELK-positive
cells was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent
manner (p < 0.0001, Figure 4B and Supplementary
Figure S6B, C). In addition, we examined a proliferation
marker Ki67 by immunohistochemistry and found that its
positivity was significantly decreased in OTS167-treated
tumors (p < 0.0001, Figure 4C), compared with the control
group. These data provided the evidence supporting that
impaired tumor growth was caused by the suppression of
MELK activity. Furthermore, we performed western blot
and immunohistochemical analyses of MELK-downstream
molecules. The expression levels of DEPDC1 and FOXM1
were significantly decreased in MELK-inhibitor treated
tissues (Figures 4A and 5A, B, p < 0.0001). Interestingly,
p21 and p53 expression levels were also significantly
increased in OTS167-treated tissues (Figures 4A and 5C,
5D, p < 0.0001). However, interestingly, the expression
of p21 protein was slightly induced at day 4 in MDAwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MB-231 xenograft tissues in which p53 was mutated,
but reduced at later days (Supplementary Figure S6A).
Moreover, expression levels of Snail (A549, Figure 4A)
and Slug (MDA-MB-231, Supplementary Figure S6A)
were also drastically decreased in tumor tissues treated
with the MELK inhibitor, indicating that targeting MELK
could reduce cancer stem cell population in tumor tissues.

DISCUSSION
The remarkable technical advances in molecular
biology as well as genetics/genomics have allowed us to
effectively identify disease-specific and/or disease-causing
molecular alterations. Accordingly, there is a striking
paradigm shift in cancer treatment from ‘one-size-fits-all’
to the selection of therapy based upon patient’s molecular
abnormalities, so called ‘personalized or precision cancer
medicine’ [22]. To achieve the goal of ‘cancer precision
medicine’, co-development of molecular-targeted drugs
together with molecular diagnostics is critically important.

Not only the selection of appropriate targets, but also the
elucidation of molecular mechanisms of targets is essential
to deliver drugs effectively and safely to patients [23].
OTS167 was developed as a MELK kinase inhibitor
with potent and selective antitumor activity without any
obvious toxicity at the effective dose in our preclinical
study. MELK is specifically and frequently upregulated
in various types of human cancer including breast cancer,
brain tumors, prostate cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia
[6-9, 11]. The mechanism of MELK transactivation
is not yet elucidated though several research groups
and the public database such as COSMIC and TCGA
indicated that there was no genetic alteration such as gene
amplification or epigenetic dysregulation [24-26]. We
assume that since MELK is highly expressed in stem cells
and cancer cells are considered to originate from stem
cells, cancer tissues including a relatively high proportion
of cancer stem cells reveal higher MELK expression. In
addition to the overexpression, this kinase is shown to
have important biological roles in cancer cells such as
proliferation, survival, metastasis and maintenance of
stemness. Several molecules were identified as substrates
of MELK or downstream proteins in the MELK pathway
[6, 14, 15, 27]. However, the biological function of MELK
in cancer cells is still far from full understanding.
In the present study, we have performed further
biological analysis of MELK protein as well as
pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic evaluation
of OTS167. We found that suppression of MELK
induced enlargement of cytoplasm and induction of
cytoplasmic projection like a neuronal-cell phenotype.
These phenotypes were not observed in cells treated
with cytotoxic agents like adryamycin or paclitaxel.
Because MELK promoted cell invasiveness [10, 14], it
was almost certain that MELK is involved in regulation
of cytoskeleton. DEPDC1 is also upregulated in several
types of human cancer including breast cancer according
to the public database [28], and a recent study indicated
that DEPDC1 is related to cytoskeletal regulation [29].
Hence, we examined the relationship between MELK
and DEPDC1, and found that MELK is likely to regulate
phosphorylation and stability of DEPDC1 protein.
Intriguingly, DEPDC1 was reported as a gene that is
associated with breast cancer brain metastasis [30].
Though further investigation is needed, our results suggest
that MELK might be involved in brain metastasis of breast
cancer through DEPDC1 regulation.
In addition, MELK expression was also elevated in
cancer stem cells and overexpression of MELK was shown
to enhance spheroid formation of cancer cells [15, 16,
31]. We previously investigated the suppression of breast
cancer spheroid formation by pharmacological inhibition
of MELK [14]. OTS167 was more potently inhibited
the mammosphere formation rather than proliferation
of attached cancer cells. In this study, we analyzed the
expression of stem-cell marker using OTS167-treated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell lines or xenograft tissues. Slug and Snail, well known
markers for stem cells, were indicated to induce EMT
(epithelial-mesenchymal transition) [32, 33]. We found
that expression of MELK and stem cell marker proteins
was higher in in vivo A549 xenograft tissues than in vitro
cultured cells (Figure 4A), further suggesting previous
results that cancer stem cells expressing MELK at high
level have the growth advantage in vivo. We clearly
demonstrated that the expression of Slug and Snail
proteins was decreased in tumors which were treated
with OTS167, indicating that OTS167 might lead to loss
of cancer stem-like characteristics through inhibition of
MELK function.
Not only cancer stem cell markers, but other
MELK-related proteins such as DEPDC1, and FOXM1 as
well as major tumor-suppressive proteins, p21 and p53,
also showed drastic alterations in their protein levels with
treatment of OTS167 both in cell lines and in xenograft
tumor tissues. It is reported that suppression of MELK
by siRNA activated the p53 pathway and induced cell
cycle arrest [34], and our results also indicated the strong
activation of p53 and p21 in p53 wild-type cancer cells
with treatment of MELK inhibitor. However, the activation
of p21 was also observed in p53-mutant cells although it
was relatively weak in p53-mutated cancer cells. These
data indicated that p21 might be activated by MELK
suppression regardless to the p53 status. As described
above, cancer cells with p53 wild-type showed relatively
higher sensitivity to OTS167 than p53-mutant cells.
Although further validation is required, MELK inhibition
may be enhanced in the presence of wild-type p53 since
p53 can activate multiple downstream genes involved in
growth arrest or apoptosis [35]. Moreover, changes in the
levels of proteins examined here were observed even at
an early time-point of the treatment and could be used for
monitoring the antitumor effect. Thus, the clinical efficacy
in the patients who will be treated with OTS167 might
be predictable by the analysis of these markers in biopsy
samples at the relatively early stage of treatment.
In conclusion, our findings provide further evidence
of mode of mechanism that OTS167 suppresses tumor
growth by impairment of the MELK signaling pathway.
Although further evaluation in human cases is required,
the baseline changes of protein expression can be
applicable to assess the clinical response of OTS167 as
pharmacodynamic biomarker. Moreover, it would be
possible to determine optimal biological dosage and the
best treatment strategy of OTS167 in patients using these
biomarkers.

dissolved in RIPA buffer to extract protein. Cell or tissue
lysates were collected after centrifugation and analyzed
protein concentration using BCA Protein Assay kit
(Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Then proteins were separated by electrophoresis using
8% or 15% SDS-PAGE gel and subsequently transferred
onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. Membranes were
incubated with the first antibody as described above. After
washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1
hour at room temperature and then developed using ECL
Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare).

Cell lines
MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells were purchased from
ATCC (USA). COS7 cell was purchased from RIKEN
BRC Cell Bank (Japan). Cells were authenticated by
microscopic morphology check prior to perform each
experiment and screened for mycoplasma contamination
by PCR-based detection kit (Takara). Cells were cultured
under appropriate media recommended by suppliers with
10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Wako).
All cells except MDA-MB-231 were maintained at 37°C
in humidified air with 5% CO2. MDA-MB-231 was
maintained at 37°C in humidified air without CO2.

In vivo phosphorylation assay and Lambda
protein phosphatase assay
Detailed information of plasmids expressing
FLAG-tagged DEPDC1 or HA-tagged MELK (wildtype (wt) or kinase-dead mutant (D150A)) is described
in previous reports [6, 36]. DEPDC1 was co-transfected
with mock, MELK wild-type or MELK D150A into COS7
cells using X-tream Gene HP (Roche). After 24-hour
incubation, cells were treated with 0.2uM Okadaic acid
(Sigma) for 3 hours and collected with RIPA buffer. The
samples were then separated by 12.5% SuperSep Phostag gel (Wako) electrophoresis. For lambda phosphatase
assay, lambda phosphatase (NEB) was added into cell
lysate and incubated for 1 hour at 30°C. Proteins were
separated by SuperSep Phos-tag gel and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was incubated with
anti-Flag antibody as described above. After washing,
membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1hour at room
temperature, developed using ECL Western Blotting

Animal study
The animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with Institutional Guidelines for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals. A549 or MDA-MB-231
cells were injected into NOD-scid mice (Charles River
Laboratory). When xenografts had reached an average
volume of 200 mm3, animals were randomly sorted into
groups (9 mice each/group for an A549 xenograft model
and 12 mice each/group for a MDA-MB-231 model). For
intravenous administration, OTS167 was formulated in
5% glucose and injected into the tail vein twice weekly
for 3 weeks. Each xenograft mice was treated with
OTS167 or vehicle of given concentration at days 0, 3,
7, 11, 13 and 17. Tumor volumes were determined twice
per week using a caliper. The results were converted to
tumor volume (mm3) by the formula length x width2 x 1/2.
Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated according
to the formula {1-(T-T0)/(C-C0)} x 100, where T and T0 are
the mean tumor volumes at days 18 and 0, respectively, for
the OTS167-treated group, and C and C0 are those for the
vehicle control group. Three or four mice of each group
were sacrificed at days 4, 11 and 18 to collect tumors.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses and plots were carried out
using R statistical environment version 3.2.0 [37]. All
values were presented as means ± SD. Student’s t-tests
were used for two-group comparison. For multiple-group
comparison, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
method with Tukey’s post hoc corrections was used. The
level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
