BACKGROUND: Patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who develop disease progression with
standard cisplatin-based therapy are reported to have a poor overall prognosis. Irinotecan and paclitaxel are active
as single agents and exhibit preclinical synergy in SCLC cell lines. A phase 2 study was conducted to evaluate this
combination in patients with recurrent or refractory SCLC. METHODS: Patients with SCLC who progressed with 1
prior chemotherapy regimen and had measurable disease present; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status (PS) of 0 to 2; and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function were included in the
study. Paclitaxel (at a dose of 75 mg/m2) and irinotecan (at a dose of 50 mg/m2) were administered intravenously on
Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week treatment cycle. Therapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The target response rate of interest was 30%. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were enrolled, 51 of whom
received at least 1 dose of therapy. The majority of the patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (96%). A median of 3
cycles of treatment was administered, and 15 patients received 6 cycles. Seventeen patients experienced toxicity of
grade 3 or higher (neutropenia in 8 patients and fatigue in 5 patients). The overall response rate was 21%. The median
survival was 25.4 weeks, and the 1-year survival rate was 22%. CONCLUSIONS: The regimen of irinotecan and paclitaxel was found to be tolerated well in patients with recurrent or refractory SCLC. Although modest anticancer activC 2010 American

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the United
States. The majority of the patients have extensive stage disease at the time of diagnosis.1 The standard treatment for
patients with extensive stage SCLC is systemic chemotherapy with the combination of platinum and etoposide. This regimen is associated with a median survival of approximately 8 to 10 months and a response rate of 50% to 80%.2,3 Despite
initial responsiveness to chemotherapy, SCLC is categorized by rapid progression to a refractory disease. Recurrent disease
is categorized as either sensitive or refractory based on the outcome of first-line chemotherapy. Patients who progress 90
days after completion of first-time chemotherapy are considered to have sensitive disease. Patients who progress while
receiving first-line therapy or within 90 days of completion are believed to have refractory SCLC. The outcome for subsequent therapy varies between patients with sensitive and refractory SCLC.
Topotecan, a novel topoisomerase inhibitor, is the only agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
for the treatment of patients with recurrent SCLC, and its use is restricted to patients with sensitive disease recurrence.
This was based on a phase 3 study that compared the efficacy of topotecan with that of a combination regimen comprised
of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV).4 The response rate and overall survival were similar for the 2
treatment arms. However, improvement in symptoms occurred in a higher percentage of patients with topotecan than

CAV. Despite the modest benefits with second-line therapy, the overall prognosis for patients with recurrent
SCLC remains poor.
Irinotecan is a semisynthetic camptothecin that
exhibits anticancer activity against a variety of malignancies. It is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Several studies have
demonstrated anticancer activity with irinotecan in
patients with SCLC.5-7 In preclinical studies, irinotecan
exhibits synergistic or supra-additive anticancer effects in
combination with paclitaxel.8,9 Furthermore, the favorable anticancer effects appeared to be sequence specific to
the administration of paclitaxel initially and then followed
by irinotecan. Paclitaxel and irinotecan are also associated
with a nonoverlapping toxicity profile when administered
on a weekly schedule. The optimal dose and schedule of
irinotecan and paclitaxel were established in a phase 1
study reported by Murren et al.10 When administered on
Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle, paclitaxel and irinotecan at doses of 75 mg/m2 and 50 mg/m2, respectively,
were found to be tolerated well. Furthermore, there were
no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between these
2 agents. Neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity, with
diarrhea being the most common nonhematologic
toxicity.
The known anticancer activity of irinotecan and
paclitaxel in SCLC, the favorable interactions as a combination, and their nonoverlapping toxicity profile provided
the basis for this phase 2 study in patients with refractory
or recurrent SCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients with histologic or cytologic confirmation of
SCLC were eligible for the study. Other salient eligibility
criteria included disease progression with 1 prior chemotherapy, the presence of measurable disease, an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2, and age >18 years. Qualifying laboratory criteria were as follows: leukocyte count 3000/lL,
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1500/lL, platelet
count 100,000/lL, serum total bilirubin  institutional
upper limit of normal (ULN), serum transaminases 2.5
 ULN, and serum creatinine 1.5 times ULN. At least
4 weeks should have elapsed since prior chemotherapy
and 2 weeks from prior radiotherapy. All patients were
required to sign an informed consent form. Patients who
had received prior therapy with paclitaxel and irinotecan

were excluded. The presence of untreated brain metastasis
was permitted if the patient was asymptomatic from the
brain lesions. Symptomatic patients should have received
prior radiotherapy before the initiation of study treatment. Patients with a history of Gilbert syndrome and peripheral neuropathy of severity greater than grade 1 were
excluded. In addition, patients with uncontrolled concurrent illness, major surgery within 2 weeks before registration, pregnancy, and lactation were also excluded from
the study. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pittsburgh.
Treatment Plan
Paclitaxel was administered at the dose of 75 mg/m2 over
60 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of every 21–day cycle, and
irinotecan was administered at the dose of 50 mg/m2 over
90 minutes after the completion of paclitaxel on Days 1
and 8 of each cycle. All treatments were administered in
the outpatient setting. The premedication regimen comprised of a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist,
dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and a histamine-2 receptor antagonist. Patients who experienced cholinergic
reactions during or within 1 hour of infusion of irinotecan
were treated with atropine at a dose of 1 mg intravenously
by the subcutaneous route. Treatment cycles were
repeated every 3 weeks. Radiographic studies were performed every 2 cycles of therapy for assessment of
response. Efficacy was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).11 Toxicity was
graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (version 2.0). Treatment cycles were
continued until disease progression, unacceptable adverse
events, or withdrawal of informed consent. The use of
prophylactic granulocyte–colony–stimulating factors was
not allowed.
Dose Modifications for Toxicity
Dose modifications were permitted for patients who experienced toxicity. Before each day of chemotherapy administration, the patients were required to have an ANC
1500/lL, a platelet count 100,000/lL, and peripheral
neuropathy and diarrhea of grade 1 in severity. For
patients who did not meet the criteria on Day 1 of each
cycle, the dose was delayed by 1 week. When the toxicity
resolved to grade 1 in severity, subsequent doses were
administered without dose modifications. For patients
who did not meet the criteria on Day 8 of each cycle, the
planned dose was suspended.

ECOG indicates Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.

In the event of grade 4 toxicity during a cycle, the
next dose of the causative drug was reduced by 1 dose
level. For purposes of dose reduction, the dose of paclitaxel and irinotecan were reduced by decrements of 15
mg/m2 and 10 mg/m2, respectively. A maximum of 2
dose reductions were allowed per patient. The dose of irinotecan was reduced for diarrhea of grade 2. The dose
of paclitaxel was reduced in the event of neuropathy of
grade 2. The dose of both agents was reduced in the
event of grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days, grade 3 or 4
neutropenia associated with fever, or grade 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia. Dose re-escalation was not allowed.
Patient Evaluations
Baseline evaluations were conducted within 1 week before
the initiation of protocol therapy. A history and physical
examination, complete blood count with differential, serum chemistry, vital signs, serum pregnancy test for
women of childbearing potential, and assessment of PS
were required at baseline. Radiographic studies including
computerized axial tomography scan were performed
within 4 weeks of study entry and every 2 cycles thereafter.
Toxicity was assessed on each day of chemotherapy and at
the initiation of every cycle. Bone scans and magnetic resonance imaging scans were only required when prompted
by appropriate symptoms. Routine imaging of the brain
was not necessary in asymptomatic patients.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of the study was response rate. The
Simon 2–stage design was used. A response rate of 30%
with the experimental regimen was considered to be of in-

1346

terest and a response rate <15% was classified as not worthy of further study. The estimated sample size was 55
patients. A total of 23 patients were to be accrued to the
first stage of the study. If 4 responses were observed in
the first stage, then the study would proceed to full accrual
of an additional 32 patients. This design had a type I error
of 10% with a power of 90%. Secondary endpoints
included assessment of toxicity, time to disease progression, and overall survival.

RESULTS
Patient Baseline Characteristics
A total of 55 patients were entered into the study between
the years 2004 and 2007 (Table 1). Four patients never
initiated protocol therapy after registration. The reasons
included the decision to seek other therapy (1 patient),
progression of symptoms that required radiotherapy
before the initiation of protocol therapy (1 patient), and
logistical issues (2 patients). Fifty-one patients received at
least 1 dose of protocol therapy and were considered
evaluable for both response and toxicity. Twenty-three
(45%) of the patients were women. The median age was
61 years. A total of 23 patients had an ECOG PS of 0, and
26 patients had a PS of 1. All patients had received prior
chemotherapy, and 29 had received prior radiotherapy.
Treatment Delivery and Toxicity
The median number of treatment cycles administered
was 3. Fifteen patients received 6 cycles of treatment
(Table 2). Disease progression was the most common reason for discontinuation from study. Three patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity (fatigue and
diarrhea). Two patients decided to come off study due to
logistical reasons including difficulty in commuting to the
treatment center. There were no treatment-related deaths

reported. Overall, the treatment was tolerated well. The
majority of the patients completed protocol therapy without the need for dose modifications. Toxicities of grade
3 were noted in 17 patients, of which 10 occurred during
the first cycle of therapy. The majority of the toxicities
reported in the first cycle were of grade 1 or 2 severity
(Table 3). Reported grade 3 toxicities included allergic
reactions, bone marrow suppression, fatigue, diarrhea,
and laboratory abnormalities. Grade 3 or higher neutropenia was noted in 8 treatment cycles. Five episodes of
grade 3 fatigue were recorded. There was no neuropathy
of grade 3 reported. Hyponatremia of grade 3 was
noted in 2 patients.
Efficacy
All 51 patients who received at least 1 dose of therapy
were considered evaluable for efficacy. Seven patients
were alive at the time of last follow–up. Although the

Cancer

study met its efficacy goals during the first stage of accrual,
the overall response rate of 21% did not meet the anticipated response rate of 30%. Among 28 patients who were
sensitive to first-line chemotherapy, there were 7 partial
responses achieved, for an overall response rate of 25%.
Among the 14 patients who had refractory disease to prior
therapy, only 2 responses were noted, for an objective
response rate of 14%. The outcome data with first-line
chemotherapy was not available for 9 patients. The differences in response rate between patients with sensitive disease and those with refractory disease was not found to be
statistically significant (P ¼ .6925), in this post hoc analysis. In addition, 36% of the patients experienced disease
stabilization. The overall median survival was 25.4 weeks
(Fig. 1). The 6-month survival rate was 47%, and the 1year survival rate was 22%. The median progression-free
(PFS) survival for patients who had refractory disease to
first-line therapy was 2 months compared with 3 months

for patients who were sensitive to prior therapy. The median overall survival for the sensitive and refractory populations was 7.6 months and 5.5 months, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Patients with progression of SCLC after platinum-based
chemotherapy have a poor overall prognosis. The initial
approval of topotecan for patients with recurrent sensitive
SCLC was based only on qualitative benefits. When single-agent topotecan was compared with placebo in a
randomized phase 3 trial for patients with recurrent
SCLC,12 the median survival was 26 weeks with topotecan compared with 13 weeks with best supportive care.
There were improvements in several cancer-related symptoms in patients treated with topotecan compared with
supportive care. Topotecan has also proven efficacious in
combination with cisplatin in patients with previously
untreated SCLC.13 Although topotecan has documented
activity in both chemotherapy–naive patients and patients
with recurrent SCLC, the evaluation of novel agents and
regimens to improve the outcome of patients with SCLC
is urgently needed.
The current study evaluated a combination regimen
of paclitaxel and irinotecan for recurrent SCLC. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate this combination in the second-line treatment setting for SCLC. The
majority of the patients included in the study had sensitive
disease to prior chemotherapy. Despite excellent tolerance
of the treatment regimen, the response rate was modest at
21%. The median PFS and overall survival results were
also modest. For patients with sensitive disease, the median survival was 7 months. Despite the activity of this

1348

regimen in patients with refractory disease, it is unlikely to
represent a major step forward in the treatment of recurrent SCLC. Because the study did not meet the target to
reject null hypothesis (response rate of 30%), no further
follow-up is planned.
Irinotecan has recently garnered a great deal of interest as a treatment option for SCLC, based on a phase
3 study by Noda et al.14 Their study randomized patients
to treatment with cisplatin in combination with either
irinotecan or etoposide. The study was closed early due
to the superior efficacy noted with the cisplatin-irinotecan regimen and led to the adoption of this regimen as a
new standard in the Japanese patient population. However, 2 randomized phase 3 studies conducted outside Japan have failed to confirm the superiority of the
cisplatin-irinotecan regimen in the first-line treatment of
patients with extensive–stage SCLC.15,16 The higher
sensitivity to irinotecan noted in the Japanese patient
population may be related to unique pharmacogenomic
characteristics and warrants further evaluation. In the
United States, the cisplatin-irinotecan regimen is no longer considered an evidence-based option for the first-line
therapy of SCLC.
Overall, to our knowledge, very little progress has
been made in the treatment of SCLC in recent years.
Amrubicin, an anthracycline, has demonstrated promising activity in phase 2 studies and is currently under phase
3 investigation for patients with refractory or recurrent
SCLC.17 In addition, several molecularly targeted agents
are currently under investigation. However, the initial
results reported with some of the targeted agents have
been disappointing. Imatinib, an inhibitor of the c-kit receptor, failed to demonstrate any anticancer activity in
patients with SCLC.18 Cediranib, an orally administered,
potent vascular growth factor receptor inhibitor was
recently tested as second-line therapy for patients with
recurrent or refractory SCLC.19 No objective responses
were noted, and the study did not proceed to the second
stage of its accrual design. Agents that target the Bcl-2
pathway have also been under evaluation during recent
times. Oblimersen, an antisense oligonucleotide against
Bcl-2, was evaluated in combination with standard chemotherapy in a phase 2 study of extensive–stage SCLC.20
The results were indicative of an inferior hazards ratio for
both PFS and overall survival with the addition of oblimersen. Recently, agents that inhibit various Bcl-2 family
proteins have entered clinical trials in SCLC based on
promising preclinical data.21 Although the results presented to date with targeted agents in SCLC have been

disappointing, it is hoped that an improved understanding of the unique biologic characteristics of SCLC will
lead to the development of newer classes of agents to combat this disease.
