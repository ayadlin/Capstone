Abstract
Type 2 topoisomerases, in particular the A isoform in human
cells, play a key role in cohesion and sister chromatid separation
during mitosis. These enzymes are thus vital for cycling cells
and are obvious targets in cancer chemotherapy. Evidence
obtained in yeast and Xenopus model systems indicates that
conjugation of topoisomerase 2 with small ubiquitin-like
modifier (SUMO) proteins is required for its mitotic functions.
Here, we provide biochemical and cytologic evidence that
topoisomerase 2A is conjugated to SUMO-2/3 during interphase
and mitosis in response to topoisomerase 2 inhibitors and
‘‘poisons’’ (ICRF-187, etoposide, doxorubicin) that stabilize
catalytic intermediates (cleavage complexes, closed clamp
forms) of the enzyme onto target DNA. During mitosis, SUMO2/3–modified forms of topoisomerase 2A localize to centromeres and chromosome cores/axes. However, centromeres are
unresponsive to inhibitors during interphase. Furthermore,
formation of topoisomerase 2A–SUMO-2/3 conjugates within
mitotic chromosomes strongly correlates with incomplete
chromatid decatenation and decreases progressively as cells
approach the metaphase-anaphase transition. We also found
that the PIASy protein, an E3 ligase for SUMO proteins,
colocalizes with SUMO-2/3 at the mitotic chromosomal cores/
axes and is necessary for both formation of SUMO-2/3
conjugates and proper chromatid segregation. We suggest that
the efficacy of topoisomerase inhibitors to arrest cells traversing
mitosis may relate to their targeting of topoisomerase 2A–
SUMO-2/3 conjugates that concentrate at mitotic chromosome
axes and are directly involved in chromatid arm separation.

Introduction
Topoisomerases are complex multifunctional enzymes that are
required to resolve topological complexities that arise in the genome
as a result of DNA-based cellular activities. In eukaryotic cells, type II
enzymes act as dimers that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to
introduce a transient double-stranded cleavage in the DNA helix,
through which the passage of a separate intact helix is promoted.
The nicked DNA double strand is subsequently (re)ligated under

ATP hydrolysis, followed by dissociation of topoisomerase 2 from
target DNA. This capacity to cleave and religate both DNA strands
explains why type II topoisomerases are required for diverse aspects
of DNA metabolism, such as transcription, replication, recombination, chromosome condensation/decondensation and segregation,
and possibly DNA repair (1–3). Indeed, certain types of topological
complexities, such as knots, tangles, and catenanes require for their
resolution that DNA be cleaved on both strands (4).
Whereas yeasts and Drosophila contain only a single type II
topoisomerase, mammals possess two isoforms of the enzyme, a
and h (5). Although both isoforms may facilitate transcription of
chromatin templates (6–8), only the a isoform is absolutely
required for full removal of catenanes remaining in DNA after
replication in S phase (2, 3), which is essential for chromatid
separation during anaphase (9, 10).
Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, which in
mammals comprise three isoforms (1–3), are distantly related to
ubiquitin (20% identity), and their covalent binding to target
proteins occurs through a stepwise process closely resembling that
used by the ubiquitin conjugation pathway (11, 12).
Topoisomerase 2 inhibitors that trap catalytic intermediates
of these enzymes onto target DNA may stabilize conjugates of
topoisomerase 2h with either SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3 and of
topoisomerase 2a with SUMO-1 (13, 14). However, it remains
unknown whether conjugation of topoisomerase 2a with SUMO-2/3
is also promoted by these drugs. Interestingly, these drugs interfere
with chromatid separation during anaphase, and recent genetic and
biochemical evidence obtained from yeast and Xenopus model
systems implicate the SUMO conjugation pathway in chromatid
cohesion and separation during M phase (15–17). Data obtained
using mammalian cells corroborate these conclusions (18, 19).
Because the a isoform of topoisomerase 2 plays a major role in
chromosomal events occurring during mitosis, namely in chromatid cohesion and separation, it is important to determine (a)
whether in mammalian cells traversing mitosis topoisomerase 2a
conjugates with SUMO proteins and whether SUMO paralogs are
differentially used in M phase and interphase and (b) whether in
mitosis components of the SUMO conjugation pathway localize to
chromosomal domains involved in chromatid cohesion/segregation, and if so, whether they modulate topoisomerase 2–dependent
chromatid separation. We have, herein, addressed these issues
making use of well-characterized topoisomerase 2 inhibitors that
stabilize specific catalytic intermediates of the enzyme.

Figure 1. Topoisomerase 2 (Topo 2) inhibitors stabilize catalytically committed
conjugates of topoisomerase IIa with SUMO-2/3. A, a similar number
(f20  106) of asynchronously growing (f96% in interphase) HeLaHis-SUMO-2,
HeLaHis-myc-SUMO-1, or HeLa wt cells was treated with 50 Ag/mL ICRF-187 (+)
or solvent alone ( ) for 20 min. Cells were lysed in 6 mol/L guanidium-HCL buffer
and processed for Ni2+-affinity purification of His-SUMO–conjugated forms.
Purified forms were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane, and probed with topoisomerase 2a–specific antibodies.
B, experimental design was as delineated above except that cell lines were
exposed to 25 Amol/L etoposide (+) for 20 min or solvent alone ( ).
C, HeLaHis-SUMO-2 and HeLaHis-myc-SUMO-1 cells exposed to ICRF-187(+)
(50 Ag/mL, 20 min) or solvent( ) were subjected to salt (350 mmol/L NaCl)–
detergent extraction according to the DRT protocol; blots of gel resolved proteins
present in the insoluble remnants were probed with antibodies specific for either
topoisomerase 2a or topoisomerase 1; note that topoisomerase 2a, but not
topoisomerase 1, is enriched in the insoluble fraction of ICRF-187(+) cells.
D, HeLaHis-SUMO-2, HeLaHis-myc-SUMO-1, and HeLa wt cells were treated with
ICRF-187(+) or solvent( ) and extracted according to the DRT protocol, as
above, before affinity (Ni-NTA) purification of salt-detergent insoluble SUMO
conjugates; shown are blots of gel resolved SUMO conjugates probed for
topoisomerase 2a.

described (20). Cell lines stably expressing His-tagged isoforms of
SUMO proteins (SUMO-2 or SUMO-1), respectively HeLaHis6-SUMO-2 and
HeLaHis6-myc-SUMO-1, were described previously (21, 22) and were cultured as
indicated. Purification of mitotic cells and cell synchronization procedures
(G1-S transition and G2 stages) were as described (20).
Antibodies and chemicals. The following antibodies were used: mouse
monoclonals against topoisomerase 2a, clone Ki-S1 (Chemicon International), and clone 3D4 (Abcam); mouse monoclonal anti–h-actin (clone
ac-15; Sigma-Aldrich). Rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for human
topoisomerase 2a, human topoisomerase 2h, human topoisomerase 1,
SUMO-2+3, SUMO-1, SMC-2, and PIASy were from Abcam. Antikinetochore
autoimmune antisera specific for CENP-A/C was a kind gift from W. van
Venrooij (Katholieke Universiteit, Nijmegen, the Netherlands). Antihemagglutinin (HA) epitope monoclonal antibody (clone 16B12) was from
Covance Research Products. FITC-conjugated, Alexa 488–conjugated, Cy3conjugated, and Cy5-conjugated affinity-purified secondary antibodies for
immunofluorescence procedures were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Chemicals used in this research were ICRF-187 from
Chiron Laboratories, merbarone from Calbiochem/Merck Biosciences, and
etoposide (VP-16), doxorubicin (Adriamycin), aclarubicin, and roscovitine
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Affinity purification of His-tagged SUMO conjugates, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting. Purification of His6-SUMO conjugates
and detection of proteins by Western blotting were performed as described
previously (20–23). Immunoprecipitation of topoisomerase 2a and SUMO2/3 proteins from mitotic cells was conducted after initial alkaline lysis as
described elsewhere (24), except that immunoprecipitation buffer was
supplemented with 10 mmol/L N-ethylmaleimide.
Differential retention of topoisomerase assay. The differential
retention of topoisomerase (DRT) assay was performed as detailed in a
previous publication (20).
Topoisomerase 2A and PIASy small interfering RNA transfection
and plasmid construction. For topoisomerase 2a RNA interference (RNAi)
experiments, the following oligonucleotides targeting topoisomerase 2a have
been used: OLIGO 1 (5-GCA CAU CAA AGG AAG CUA A-3) and OLIGO 2
(5-GCC AUC CAC UUC UGA UGA U-3) from Eurogentech S.A. As controls,
both a scramble sequence (5-GGC AAG ACU CAA GAA UCA A-3) and mock
transfection (no oligo) were used. Oligonucleotides for PIASy RNAi experiments were used as previously reported (19). dsRNA oligonucleotides were
transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Culture medium was changed 24 h after transfection, and cells
were incubated for an additional 24 h before collection. pcDNA3/HA-huPIASy
was constructed according to standard recombinant DNA techniques.
Immunofluorescence, microscopy, and image analysis. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells growing on coverslips were routinely fixed in
freshly prepared 3.7% paraformaldehyde in HPEM buffer [30 mmol/L
HEPES, 65 mmol/L Pipes, 10 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L MgCl2 (pH 6.9)] plus
0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature before immunostaining
(20). To enhance detection of SUMO proteins coverslips were placed in
10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 7) and subjected to microwave treatment
(700 W, 30 s) before immunostaining.
Confocal microscopy analysis, image segmentation procedures and quantification of fluorescence intensities were performed as described in detail
elsewhere (20).

Results
Human topoisomerase 2A is conjugated to SUMO-2 during
interphase in response to ICRF-187 and etoposide. Previous
studies in mammalian cells have shown that conjugation of
topoisomerase 2a and h to SUMO-1 is induced by catalytic
inhibitors of topoisomerase 2 activity, such as ICRF-193 (14).
Here, we tested whether human topoisomerase 2a is also modified
with SUMO-2 in response to different classes of topoisomerase
2 inhibitors. To this end, we used stable cell lines expressing
either His6-SUMO-2 or His6-myc-SUMO-1 (21, 22), which allow

Human Topoisomerase 2a Conjugates with SUMO-2

Figure 2. During mitosis human topoisomerase 2a is conjugated to SUMO-2 in response to ICRF-187. A, left , HeLa wt mitotic cells were purified by mechanical
shake-off (z95% mitotics), replated in poly-L-lysine coated dishes, and given either solvent( ) or ICRF-187(+) (50 Ag/mL, 20 min) before lysis in Laemmli’s sample
buffer; proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in low acrylamide (6%) gels before electro-blotting and probing with antibodies specific for topoisomerase 2a and
SUMO-2/3 proteins. Right, the same whole mitotic cell extracts were resolved in high acrylamide (12%) gel before labeling of immunoblots for SUMO-2/3 proteins;
arrow, unconjugated/free SUMO-2/3 proteins. B, purified mitotic HeLaHis-SUMO-2, HeLaHis-myc-SUMO-1, and HeLa wt cells were treated with 50 Ag/mL ICRF-187(+) or
solvent( ) for 20 min before lysis in 6 mol/L guanidium-HCL buffer and processing for Ni2+-affinity purification of His-SUMO–conjugated forms. Immunoblots of
SDS-PAGE resolved conjugates were probed with topoisomerase 2a–specific antibodies. C, top, whole mitotic cell extracts obtained from purified HeLa wt cells (ICRF
+/ ; 50 Ag/mL, 20 min) were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP ) with SUMO-2/3–specific antibodies (4 Ag antiserum/f20  106 cells), separated in 7% acrylamide
gels and processed for Western blotting (WB ) with SUMO-2/3–specific and topoisomerase 2a–specific (mouse monoclonal plus rabbit polyclonal) antibodies. For each
experimental group (ICRF +/ ), equal amounts of mitotic extract were mock-precipitated in parallel (no antibody controls; bottom ) and whole mitotic cell extracts
obtained and treated as above (ICRF +/ ; 50 Ag/mL, 20 min) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti–topoisomerase 2a monoclonal antibody (clone KiS1; 5 Ag
antibody/f20  106 cells) or else mock-precipitated. Western blots were probed with anti–topoisomerase 2a and anti–SUMO-2/3 antibodies as described above.

purification by affinity procedures of proteins conjugated with
SUMO-2 or SUMO-1, respectively. Asynchronous cell populations
(f96% interphasic) were thus exposed to ICRF-187 (50 Ag/mL, 20
minutes) or solvent alone (controls), and whole-cell lysates were
subsequently used for affinity purification of SUMO conjugates
with Ni-NTA agarose. HeLa cells not expressing His6-tagged
SUMO isoforms (‘‘HeLa wt’’) were processed in parallel as a
negative control. Probing Western blots with anti–topoisomerase
2a antibodies revealed an enrichment in topoisomerase 2a–SUMO1 conjugates in ICRF-187–treated cells, as expected (Fig. 1A, lanes 3
and 4), but also prominent modification of topoisomerase 2a with
SUMO-2 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). We next tested whether a
prototypical topoisomerase 2 poison, etoposide (25 Amol/L, 20
minutes), which stabilizes cleavage complexes similarly induced
conjugation of topoisomerase 2a with SUMO-2. Interestingly,
treatment with etoposide resulted in significantly higher levels of
topoisomerase 2a–SUMO-2 conjugates (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2).

www.aacrjournals.org

Etoposide, as previously described for teniposide (14), also led to
increased conjugation of topoisomerase 2a with SUMO-1 (Fig. 1B,
lanes 3 and 4). Together, these results indicate that two different
classes of topoisomerase 2–specific drugs, which stabilize
topoisomerase 2 dimers at distinct stages of the catalytic cycle,
result in increased conjugation of the enzyme with SUMO-2 during
interphase.
Catalytically committed topoisomerase 2A is conjugated to
SUMO-2 and SUMO-1 during interphase. We have described
previously the DRT assay that allows an enrichment in catalytically
committed forms of topoisomerase 2 (20). In this procedure,
a topoisomerase 2–specific drug is used to selectively trap
onto target DNA topoisomerase 2 molecules that entered the
catalytic cycle, thus rendering this fraction insoluble upon subsequent exposure to salt plus detergent; controls exposed to drug
solvent alone are processed in parallel. Consequently, increments
in salt-detergent insoluble topoisomerase 2 that are observed in

Figure 3. ICRF-187 induces association of SUMO-2/3 with mitotic chromatin at stages preceding sister chromatid separation. A, cells exposed to solvent alone (left ;
controls) or ICRF-187 (right ; 50 Ag/mL, 15 min) were stained for either SUMO-2/3 or SUMO-1 with specific polyclonal antisera and imaged while traversing mitotic
stages preceding anaphase; DNA was stained with DAPI (bar, 7 Am). B, close-up view of a metaphase cell exposed to ICRF-187 and stained for SUMO-2/3 and
centromeres (CENP A/C staining; arrowheads ); colocalization of the two patterns appears yellow in the merged image (SUMO + CENP; arrowheads ). Additional
superimposition of DNA (DAPI) staining shows that SUMO-2/3 also delineates chromosome arm cores/axes in a dotted, discontinuous pattern (Merge ); bar, 4 Am.
C, cells synchronized at the G1-S border (hidroxyurea block), traversing G2 (10 h after release from a hidroxyurea block) or M stage cells (prometaphase/metaphase)
were given solvent (controls) or ICRF-187 and costained for SUMO-2/3 and CENP A/C. Cells were imaged by confocal microscopy using identical, high sensitivity,
image capture settings. For G1-S and G2 stages, 25 cells were analyzed per experimental group. For M stage, 50 cells per experimental group were analyzed in each
of a triplicate set of experiments. The intensity of the SUMO-2/3 signal that colocalized with centromeric regions (CENP A/C staining) was quantified. For each cell cycle
substage (G1-S, G2, M), the average intensity of centromere-associated SUMO-2/3 signals in the ICRF-187–treated groups was divided by the average intensity
of the centromeric SUMO-2/3 signals obtained in the corresponding matched controls (normalized to value of 1); thus, the bar corresponding to the ICRF-187 group
represents the fold increase relative to the normalized control.

drug-treated cells relative to controls mostly comprise catalytically
committed forms of the enzyme (20). Here, we used the DRT assay
to address whether topoisomerase 2a that is modified by SUMO
proteins is predominantly catalytically committed. To do so, HeLa
cells were exposed to ICRF-187 (50 Ag/mL, 20 minutes) and briefly
(2 minutes) extracted in ice-cold buffer containing detergent
(Triton X-100) plus 350 mmol/L NaCl (cf. Materials and Methods).
The insoluble remnant was lysed in guanidium and used for affinity
purification (Ni-NTA agarose) of SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 conjugates
before gel separation and immunoblotting for topoisomerase 2a.
Western blots of proteins remaining in extracted cells before
undertaking the affinity purification step revealed that ICRF-187
treatment, as previously shown for HeLa wt cells (20), readily
induced retention of additional topoisomerase 2a, but not
topoisomerase 1, in HeLaHis-SUMO-2 and HeLaHis-myc-SUMO-1 cell
lines (Fig. 1C). Analysis of purified SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 conjugates
revealed that exposure to ICRF-187 dramatically increased
retention of topoisomerase 2a forms modified with SUMO-1
(Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4) and SUMO-2 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). These

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

data are consistent with SUMO-2 and SUMO-1 modifications
occurring on catalytically committed topoisomerase 2a molecules
that were stabilized onto DNA by the inhibitor.
During mitosis, human topoisomerase 2A is conjugated to
SUMO-2 in response to ICRF-187. Previous reports have
provided evidence that in the Xenopus egg system SUMO-2/3
is the preferred isoform for conjugation with topoisomerase
II during mitosis (16, 17). To address if the same occurs in
mammalian cells, highly purified mitotic HeLa cells expressing
wt SUMO proteins were given ICRF-187 (50 Ag/mL, 20 minutes)
or solvent (controls), and whole-cell extracts were prepared
for SDS-PAGE. Western blots of gel-resolved proteins were
subsequently probed with antibodies specific for either topoisomerase 2a, SUMO-2/3, or SUMO-1. The results showed that in
ICRF-187–treated cells, there was a modest, but consistent,
increase in SUMO-2/3 conjugates of high molecular mass (z170
kDa) in relation to controls (SUMO-2/3; Fig. 2A, left); a similar
change in SUMO-1 conjugates could not be detected (data
not shown). Of note, bands of topoisomerase 2a that became

Human Topoisomerase 2a Conjugates with SUMO-2

upper-shifted in response to ICRF-187 were barely visible,
suggesting only a minor fraction of the enzyme might engage
in conjugation with SUMO proteins (topoisomerase 2a; Fig. 2A,
left). Accordingly, ICRF-187 did not induce any significant
reduction of free SUMO-2/3 proteins (Fig. 2A, right, arrow).
To ascertain whether topoisomerase 2a is indeed a mitotic substrate for SUMO-2/3 conjugation, HeLaHis-SUMO-2 and
HeLaHis-myc-SUMO-1 cell lines were incubated with ICRF-187 before
affinity purification of His6-SUMO forms. As shown in Fig. 2B
(lanes 1 and 2), ICRF-187 induced a strong increment in the
amount of topoisomerase 2a–SUMO-2 while not significantly
changing topoisomerase 2a–SUMO-1 levels (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4).
Finally, immunoprecipitation of mitotic extracts obtained from
HeLa wt cells (plus/minus ICRF-187) revealed that topoisomerase
2a and high molecular mass SUMO-2/3 conjugates (z170kDa)
coprecipitated when either anti–SUMO-2/3 or anti–topoisomerase
2a antibodies were used, with coprecipitation being enhanced by
the presence of ICRF-187 (Fig. 2C). An indifferent anti-p53 antibody
(p53 is mostly absent in HeLa cells) did not precipitate detectable
amounts of either topoisomerase 2a or SUMO-2/3 (data not
shown). These results show that human topoisomerase 2a is
conjugated to both SUMO-2 and SUMO-1 during mitosis, but ICRF187 only significantly affects conjugation with the SUMO-2 isoform.

ICRF-187 induces accumulation of SUMO-2/3 in mitotic
chromosomes. In the yeast and Xenopus model systems,
conjugation of topoisomerase 2 with SUMO paralogs during
mitosis is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion and segregation (15, 17, 25). Therefore, we were interested in determining
whether topoisomerase 2a–SUMO conjugates targeted chromosomal domains involved in cohesion and separation of chromatids.
To this end, we costained HeLa cells for SUMO-2/3, centromeres
(CENP A/C antiserum), and DNA [4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) staining] and searched for cells traversing specific substages of M phase. The results revealed a weak, but consistent,
staining for SUMO-2/3 within mitotic chromatin in prophase and
prometaphase cells (Fig. 3A, left). As reported previously in HeLa
cells (26), staining for SUMO-2/3 was mostly absent from
chromosomes at metaphase and anaphase stages, but was obvious
in the reforming nuclei of telophase cells (Fig. 3A; data not
shown). Exposure to ICRF-187 dramatically increased association
of SUMO-2/3 proteins with mitotic chromosomes in prophase
and prometaphase cells, and in a fraction of cells traversing
metaphase (Fig. 3A, right; data not shown); typically, staining
was less intense during metaphase than at preceding stages (cf.
Fig. 3A). Within chromosomes, distribution of SUMO-2/3 proteins
displayed a distinctive concentration at centromeres and the

topoisomerase 2a preceding full chromatid

(350 mmol/L NaCl) plus detergent (DRT
procedure) and fixed in formaldehyde and
immunostained for topoisomerase 2a and
SUMO-2/3; regions of colocalization appear yellow

regions (C ), or staining at both centromeres and
chromosome arms (C + A ). Histograms depict the

cores (axes) of chromosome arms (Fig. 3B). A detailed analysis
of anaphase was hampered possibly because ICRF-187 blocks
transition from metaphase to anaphase, and cells already at
anaphase upon exposure to the drug might have reached telophase
by the end of the experiment. SUMO-1, however, did not concentrate at mitotic chromosomes in response to ICRF-187 (Fig. 3A,
bottom). Interestingly, ICRF-187–dependent accumulation of SUMO-2/3 at centromeres did not occur in interphase cells (G1-S
transition, G2 stage) and was exclusive to M phase as confirmed by
quantitative analysis of the SUMO-2/3–specific fluorescent signals
(Fig. 3C).
If accumulation of SUMO-2/3 in response to ICRF-187 corresponds, at least partially, to SUMO–topoisomerase 2a conjugates
then colocalization between the staining patterns of these
two proteins should occur; this was indeed observed (Fig. 4A,
merge).
Topoisomerase 2a is known to concentrate at a chromosome
axis that is intertwined with, but mostly separate from, the axis
that concentrates components of the condensin complex (27, 28).
Thus, we subsequently analyzed the spatial relationship between

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

the SUMO-2/3 axis induced by ICRF-187 and the staining pattern of
the smc2 component of the condensin complex. The axis
delineated by SUMO-2/3, as expected from its association with
topoisomerase 2a, was mostly distinct from that decorated with
condensin (Fig. 4B). To further ascertain whether the association of
SUMO-2/3 with mitotic chromosomes in response to ICRF-187 was
indeed dependent on topoisomerase 2a, we depleted this enzyme
from HeLa cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology;
mock-depleted cells served as controls (cf. Materials and Methods).
The results showed that after depletion of >75% to 80% of
topoisomerase 2a (Fig. 4C), a fraction of mitotic cells failed to
concentrate topoisomerase 2a at chromosomes by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 4D). Importantly, these cells also displayed
little to none SUMO-2/3 onto chromosomes in response to ICRF187 (Fig. 4D ). Noteworthy, the reduction of SUMO-2/3 at
chromosome cores in cells severely depleted for topoisomerase
2a does not relate to absence of an axial structure because the
condensin axis persists in these cells (Fig. 4D). Taken together,
these data indicate that minor amounts of SUMO-2/3 proteins
associate normally with chromatin during mitotic stages that

Human Topoisomerase 2a Conjugates with SUMO-2

precede chromosome separation. However, association of SUMO-2/
3 with chromosomes (centromeres plus axes) increases sharply in
presence of a topoisomerase 2 inhibitor (ICRF-187) and normal
levels of topoisomerase 2a.
Association of SUMO-2/3 with mitotic chromatin requires
catalytic commitment of topoisomerase 2A. The data presented
above are consistent with SUMO-2/3 conjugation targeting a
subpopulation of catalytic intermediates of topoisomerase
2a (closed clamps) that are trapped onto DNA by ICRF-187. Thus,
both SUMO-2/3 and a fraction of topoisomerase 2a should
resist the salt-detergent extraction used in the DRT protocol and
remain colocalized in the mitotic chromosomes. To test this
prediction, cells given ICRF-187 (50 Ag/mL, 15 minutes) or solvent
(controls) were subjected to extraction with the DRT buffer before
fixation with formaldehyde. Costaining for topoisomerase 2a and
SUMO-2/3 revealed little topoisomerase 2a and essentially no
SUMO-2/3 over mitotic chromatin in control cells. By contrast, in
ICRF-187–treated populations, fluorescent signals from both
proteins were notoriously more intense and colocalized at
centromeres and chromosome cores/axes (Fig. 5A).
To further test whether association of SUMO-2/3 with mitotic
chromatin requires entry of topoisomerase 2a into catalysis, we
next used a battery of clinically relevant and well-characterized
inhibitors of topoisomerase 2 that block its catalytic cycle at
distinct steps. This set of drugs comprised two topoisomerase
2 inhibitors, aclarubicin and merbarone, that abrogate catalysis at
the early steps preceding DNA cleavage (29–31) and two poisons,
etoposide and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), that covalently stabilize
topoisomerase 2–DNA complexes at the cleavage complex stage
(30, 32, 33), which precedes the closed clamp conformation
stabilized by ICRF-187. Cells were thus exposed to either
aclarubicin (2 Amol/L, 15 minutes), merbarone (40 Amol/L,
15 minutes), etoposide (200 Amol/L, 15 minutes), or doxorubicin
(50 Amol/L, 15 minutes) before fixation and immunostaining with
anti–SUMO-2/3 and anti–topoisomerase 2a antibodies. Microscopic analysis revealed that only drugs that stabilize catalytic
intermediates, i.e., etoposide and doxorubicin, allow retention of
SUMO-2/3 onto mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 5B; data not shown).
In subsequent experiments, cells were exposed to aclarubicin
(2 Amol/L, 30 minutes) or merbarone (40 Amol/L, 30 minutes),
which impede initiation of catalysis, preceding addition of either
etoposide (200 Amol/L, last 15 minutes) or ICRF-187 (50 Ag/mL,
last 15 minutes) to the cultures; note that aclarubicin and merbarone remained present after subsequent addition of the other
drugs. Staining for SUMO-2/3 and topoisomerase 2a showed that
prior exposure to aclarubicin or merbarone abrogated etoposideinduced and ICRF-187–induced accumulation of SUMO-2/3 onto
mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 5B; data not shown). Together, these
results support the hypothesis that only topoisomerase 2 complexes that have engaged into DNA cleavage/religation activities
become targets for conjugation with SUMO-2/3 during mitosis.
Accumulation of SUMO-2/3 in response to ICRF-187
correlates with incomplete decatenation at chromosome
arms. We reasoned that if concentration of SUMO-2/3 at
chromosome cores correlates with topoisomerase 2a–dependent
catalytic activity, then failure to accumulate SUMO-2/3 at
chromosome arms in response to ICRF-187 (f50% of metaphase
cells show staining for SUMO-2/3 restricted to centromeres;
Fig. 5D) might highlight full catenane resolution; conversely,
retention of SUMO-2/3 should imply incomplete decatenation.
We have tested these predictions by forcing exit from mitosis with

www.aacrjournals.org

roscovitine, a cdk inhibitor, in presence of ICRF-187. Because ICRF187 impedes passage through anaphase of cells with incomplete
chromatid decatenation, we anticipated a positive correlation between ability to retain SUMO-2/3 and trapping in the preanaphase
compartment. Indeed, treatment with ICRF-187 (15 minutes) plus
roscovitine (last 7 minutes, 50 Amol/L) before collection led to
appearance of abundant cells at metaphase-anaphase transition
with chromosomes showing intense staining for SUMO-2/3
and lagging arms, the hallmark of insufficient decatenation
(Fig. 5C); centromeric domains (CENP A/C staining), however,
were fully separated as previously shown for ICRF-187–treated
cells (ref. 34; data not shown). Of note, roscovitine per se did not
induce retention of SUMO-2/3 in mitotic chromatin (Fig. 5C).
Remarkably, metaphase cells without SUMO-2/3 staining of the
arms (i.e., centromeric staining only) were now virtually absent
(Fig. 5D; data not shown). Therefore, we favor the interpretation
that cells that failed to retain SUMO-2/3 at chromosome cores in
response to ICRF-187 must have completed chromatid arm
resolution and thus escaped the metaphase block imposed by
ICRF-187.
PIASy localizes to mitotic chromosome cores and promotes
accumulation of SUMO-2/3 in response to ICRF-187. The PIASy
protein, an E3 ligase for SUMO-2/3, was shown to be responsible
for the concentration of SUMO-2 conjugates at mitotic centromeric
domains and mediation of chromatid segregation in Xenopus (17).
Here, we asked whether PIASy was required for the concentration
of SUMO-2/3 conjugates at the mitotic chromosome cores in
mammalian cells. We first searched for the localization of PIASy in
interphase and mitotic HeLa cells expressing HA-PIASy by
immunostaining with anti-HA antibodies. This showed that during
interphase PIASy is nucleoplasmic with occasional concentration
in nuclear bodies that accumulate PML and SUMO proteins, as
described (ref. 35; Fig. 6A; data not shown). PIASy staining sharply
delineates chromosome cores/axes during prometaphase and
metaphase and dissociates from chromatin during anaphase to
reappear in the reforming nuclei at telophase (Fig. 6A; data not
shown). Note that global levels of PIASy (Western blotting) are not
affected by ICRF-187 (Fig. 6A). Although PIASy localizes to
centromeric domains, there is no obvious accumulation within
these regions (data not shown). Double staining experiments
revealed that in ICRF-187–treated cells, PIASy and SUMO-2/3
proteins colocalize extensively (Fig. 6A; middle-bottom). These
results, revealing for the first time the localization of PIASy within
mitotic chromosomes, suggested a role for PIASy in the formation
of SUMO-2/3 conjugates at chromosomal cores. To further test this
idea, we used siRNA technology to efficiently deplete HeLa cells of
PIASy protein (Fig. 6B). Staining of PIASy-depleted cells for
topoisomerase 2a showed diffuse staining over mitotic chromosomes with ill-defined axes, as reported (Fig. 6B; ref. 19). Also, we
noticed that misaligned chromosomes at metaphase plates (Fig. 6B,
arrow) increased significantly after depletion of PIASy (Fig. 6C).
More importantly, depletion of PIASy almost completely abrogated
the ICRF-187–induced concentration of SUMO-2/3 proteins within
mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 6B). Finally, we checked whether PIASydepleted cells displayed chromatid segregation defects upon
roscovitine-induced forced mitotic exit in presence of ICRF-187.
Results revealed that, under steady-state conditions (no drug), the
distribution of mitotic populations between the preanaphase
(prometaphase plus metaphase) and postmetaphase (anaphase
plus telophase) compartments was similar in PIASy-depleted and
nondepleted controls (Fig. 6D). However, upon addition of

Human Topoisomerase 2a Conjugates with SUMO-2

roscovitine (plus ICRF-187, 20 minutes), PIASy-depleted cells
became significantly more trapped at the metaphase-anaphase
transition than the nondepleted controls (Fig. 6D).
Together, these data are consistent with PIASy localizing at
mitotic chromosome cores and acting locally to promote
chromatid separation and the formation of SUMO-2/3 conjugates
that may become stabilized by ICRF-187.

Discussion
In this work, we show that topoisomerase 2–specific drugs (e.g.,
etoposide and ICRF-187) that stabilize catalytic intermediates of
topoisomerase 2, namely cleavage complexes and closed clamp
forms, promote accumulation of topoisomerase 2a–SUMO-2/3
conjugates during both interphase and mitosis. During mitosis
SUMO-modified topoisomerase 2a localizes to chromosome
domains that are involved in chromatid cohesion and separation,
i.e., the centromeres and chromosome axes. We propose that the
sumoylation of this specific subpopulation of topoisomerase 2a
may explain, at least partially, the mitotic arrest induced by some
topoisomerase 2–specific drugs.
The functional relevance of sumoylation of topoisomerase 2
during mitosis seems preserved from simple to higher eukaryotic
cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which harbors a single
SUMO species (smt3/SUMO-1) and a single gene encoding for
topoisomerase 2, mutation of the smt4 isopeptidase responsible for
the removal of smt3/SUMO-1 led to cohesion defects at
centromere-proximal regions during mitosis (15). This defect was
corrected in strains containing a mutant topoisomerase 2 that was
resistant to Smt3/SUMO-1 modification, suggesting an important
role for sumoylation of topoisomerase 2 in chromatid cohesion
(15). Using the Xenopus egg extract system, it was shown that
topoisomerase 2 conjugates exclusively with SUMO-2/3 during
mitosis and that this conjugation was required for proper
separation of chromatids during anaphase (16). As expected for a
role of sumoylation in chromatid cohesion and segregation, SUMO
proteins were found at centromeres of mitotic chromosomes in
both S. cerevisiae and Xenopus (15, 17). Intriguingly, mammalian
SUMO paralogs were not detectable over mitotic chromosomes
during the metaphase to anaphase transition in HeLa cells (26).
Herein, we have performed a detailed analysis of the distribution of
SUMO-2/3 proteins in HeLa cells from prophase to early G1 stage.
In agreement with previously reported data (26), we also found that
SUMO-2/3 was mostly undetectable at chromatin during metaphase and anaphase (Fig. 3A and B; data not shown). However,
during prophase and prometaphase, centromeres and chromosome arms were weakly, but consistently, labeled for SUMO-2/3 but
not SUMO-1 (Fig. 3A and B). These findings indicate that under
normal circumstances SUMO-2/3 proteins are present onto mitotic
chromatin at low levels preceding chromatid separation. A brief
exposure of cells to ICRF-187 sufficed to dramatically increase
staining of mitotic chromosomes for SUMO-2/3 during prophase
and prometaphase and, to a lesser extent, metaphase (Fig. 3A). Our
data strongly support the notion that this drug-induced increment
in SUMO-2/3 proteins reflects the cumulative retention of sumoylated catalytic intermediates of topoisomerase 2a onto mitotic
chromatin, as discussed below. First, this accumulation of SUMO2/3 is observed when cells are treated with topoisomerase
2–specific inhibitors and poisons that stabilize catalytic intermediates of topoisomerase 2, but not with inhibitors that abrogate
initiation of catalysis (aclarubicin, merbarone). Second, preexpo-

sure of cells to aclarubicin and merbarone prevents accumulation of SUMO-2/3 when either inhibitor (ICRF-187) or poison
(etoposide) are used subsequently. Third, topoisomerase 2a and
SUMO-2/3 colocalize extensively within mitotic chromatin at
the centromere and the chromosomal axis. Fourth, depletion of
topoisomerase 2a using siRNA technology results in a sharp
decrease in the concentration of SUMO-2/3 over mitotic chromosomes in response to topoisomerase 2–specific drugs (ICRF-187,
etoposide, doxorubicin). Finally, using the DRT assay (20), we
showed that SUMO-2/3 becomes salt-detergent insoluble along
with catalytic intermediates of topoisomerase 2a (Fig. 5A).
Based on these data, we suggest that from prophase to
metaphase a subpopulation of topoisomerase 2a that localizes to
the chromosomal axis and centromeres becomes transiently
conjugated with SUMO-2/3 during catalysis (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The transient nature of this modification should explain
the small amount of SUMO proteins that normally associate with
chromosomes under steady-state conditions (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The peculiar localization of sumoylated topoisomerase
2a within the mitotic chromosome substructure (centromeres plus
axes), however, places it in a position of privilege to carry out
functions in chromatid cohesion and separation (15, 17, 19, 36). We
cannot, however, exclude that other proteins besides topoisomerase 2a become sumoylated at the axes and centromeres.
According to a current model, the mitotic chromosome axis
functions as a scaffold to tether chromatin loops via their AT-rich
regions (27, 37–39). Topoisomerase 2a and the 13S condensin are
major components of the axial scaffolding, which distribute as two
mostly independent, yet closely juxtaposed, intertwined chains.
Typically, optical sectioning of chromosomes double-stained for
topoisomerase 2a and condensin generates the appearance of a
row of beads that concentrate either topoisomerase 2a or
condensin in an alternate manner; overlap between the two
stainings does occur, but is minimal (27). Available evidence
indicates that the axial scaffold harbors insoluble topoisomerase 2a
(38, 39), which is mostly catalytically inert (40). Data presented here
indicate that the low amounts of SUMO-2/3 proteins that normally
associate with mitotic chromosomes are readily solubilized/
removed by salt (350 mmol/L NaCl) plus detergent if cells are
not exposed to topoisomerase 2 inhibitor (Fig. 5A). This is
inconsistent with SUMO-2/3 proteins binding preferentially to a
pool of insoluble topoisomerase 2a with scaffolding functions.
Instead, as reasoned above, our data favor the idea that
conjugation with SUMO proteins targets a subpopulation of
topoisomerase 2a that enters catalysis within the chromosome
axis. Thus, the chromosome axis may harbor minor amounts of
both catalytically committed and catalytically inert/insoluble
topoisomerase 2a, as previously suggested (20).
Sumoylation of topoisomerase 2 was shown to require the E3
SUMO ligase PIASy in the Xenopus egg extract system and was
predicted to influence the targeting of the enzyme to mitotic
chromatin (17). Very recently, it was reported that in mitotic
human cells PIASy is required for proper localization of topoisomerase 2a at the centromeres and, to a lesser extent, to the
chromosome cores. Importantly, targeting of topoisomerase 2 to
the centromere mediated by PIASy was shown to promote a DNA
decatenation–dependent and cohesion-independent mechanism
for sister chromatid cohesion (19). This revealed an important role
for the SUMO conjugation pathway in cohesion regulation via
topoisomerase 2a but it remained, however, unknown whether
topoisomerase 2a was the direct substrate for sumoylation. In this

research, we showed for the first time in human cells that
topoisomerase 2a conjugates with SUMO-2/3 during mitosis and
that sumoylated topoisomerase 2a distributes, along with PIASy,
through chromosomal domains involved in chromatid cohesion
and separation. We have also shown that PIASy modulates both the
formation of SUMO-2/3 conjugates within mitotic chromosomes
and the decatenation defects imposed by topoisomerase 2 inhibitors. We have additionally shown that the capacity of mitotic
chromosomes to retain SUMO-2/3 proteins in response to pharmacologically relevant topoisomerase 2–specific drugs correlated
with incomplete decatenation (Fig. 5D). This may highlight
retention of SUMO-2/3 proteins as a signature for insufficient
