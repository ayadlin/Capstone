Abstract
Cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF) are abundant in the stroma of desmoplastic cancers where they promote
tumor progression. CAFs are "activated" and as such may be uniquely susceptible to apoptosis. Using
cholangiocarcinoma as a desmoplastic tumor model, we investigated the sensitivity of liver CAFs to the cytotoxic
drug navitoclax, a BH3 mimetic. Navitoclax induced apoptosis in CAF and in myoﬁbroblastic human hepatic
stellate cells but lacked similar effects in quiescent ﬁbroblasts or cholangiocarcinoma cells. Unlike cholangiocarcinoma cells, neither CAF nor quiescent ﬁbroblasts expressed Mcl-1, a known resistance factor for navitoclax
cytotoxicity. Explaining this paradox, we found that mitochondria isolated from CAFs or cells treated with
navitoclax both released the apoptogenic factors Smac and cytochrome c, suggesting that they are primed for cell
death. Such death priming in CAFs appeared to be due, in part, to upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax.
Short hairpin RNA-mediated attenuation of Bax repressed navitoclax-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction,
release of apoptogenic factors, and apoptotic cell death. In a syngeneic rat model of cholangiocarcinoma,
navitoclax treatment triggered CAF apoptosis, diminishing expression of the desmoplastic extracellular matrix
protein tenascin C, suppressing tumor outgrowth, and improving host survival. Together, our ﬁndings argue that
navitoclax may be useful for destroying CAFs in the tumor microenvironment as a general strategy to attack solid
tumors. Cancer Res; 73(2); 897–907. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer progression is a complex, multifaceted process that
involves not only intrinsic genetic changes unique to the
malignant cell but also dynamic reciprocal communication
between the cancer cell and stromal cells within the tumor
microenvironment (1). As cancers progress, the stromal cells
become reactive, phenotypically mimicking tissues undergoing wound healing or chronic inﬂammation. Indeed, many
solid human cancers are characterized by desmoplasia, with
high numbers of myoﬁbroblasts (2). These myoﬁbroblasts
often termed cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF), express
tenascin C (Ten C), periostin, seprase, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and other proteins promoting tumor proAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,

cession, invasion, and metastases (3–5). Notably, Ten C has
been implicated in tumor progression by facilitating metastasis (6).
In liver, CAFs likely originate from hepatic stellate cells,
although CAFs may also be derived from portal ﬁbroblasts or
potentially even from bone marrow–derived precursor cells
(3). Activation of hepatic stellate cells not only converts these
cells into matrix-producing myoﬁbroblasts but also enhances
their susceptibility to apoptosis analogous to the activationinduced cell death observed in T lymphocytes (7). For example,
resolution of the wound-healing response in acute liver injury
is associated with enhanced myoﬁbroblast apoptosis, thereby
reducing their absolute numbers in the liver (8). By analogy,
one may predict that CAFs may also be uniquely sensitive to
proapoptotic stimuli, suggesting that selective deletion of
CAFs with proapoptotic therapies could potentially abrogate
their support of cancer cells. This in turn would be expected to
negatively affect tumor survival, growth, and progression.
However, selectively targeting CAF as anticancer strategy
remains largely unexplored.
Apoptosis is regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family of
proteins, which control mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP; ref. 9). A proapoptotic subset of these
proteins displays only a single Bcl-2 homology domain termed
the BH3 domain. BH3-only proteins act as initiators of cell
death by either promoting activation of the multidomain
proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bax and Bak (10) or by neutralizing
the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (9). Given the ability of the

BH3-only proteins to initiate cell death pathways, the pharmaceutical industry has developed BH3-only protein
mimetics such as navitoclax (ABT- 263; ref. 11). This small
organic molecule may exert single-agent activity in selected
cells despite its inability to directly activate Bax or Bak. The
direct cytotoxicity by a sensitizing BH3 mimetic can be
explained if the mitochondria of these cells are "primed"
for cell death (12). In one model of priming, the mitochondrial antiapoptotic proteins are nearly saturated with activator BH3-only proteins. In this model, the BH3 mimetic
may displace and liberate preexisting bound activators, thus
allowing them to trigger Bax or Bak oligomerization and
MOMP. In an alternative model termed the "embedded
together" model, antiapoptotic proteins inhibit not only
BH3-only proteins but also Bax or Bak within the outer
mitochondrial membrane (13, 14). In this latter model, BH3
mimetics may alter the competing equilibrium between the
various Bcl-2–binding partners permitting Bax or Bak activation and MOMP.
Herein, we used cholangiocarcinoma as a model of a
highly desmoplastic cancer to examine the role of proapoptotic signaling in targeting CAFs. Our results suggest that
compared with quiescent ﬁbroblasts and cholangiocarcinoma cells, CAFs are signiﬁcantly more susceptible to cell
death by navitoclax in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our data
indicate that mitochondria from CAFs appear to be primed
for cell death. These mechanistic insights expand the role of
proapoptotic therapies in cancer by suggesting that they
may target the tumor microenvironment as well as the
cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
The human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines HuCCT-1 (15),
Mz-ChA-1 (16), KMCH (17), and KMBC (18); the human
hepatic myoﬁbroblast LX-2 (19), quiescent human ﬁbroblasts (hFB) kindly provided by V.H. Shah (Division of
Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester,
MN) and R.S. Bahn (Division of Endocrinology); the
rat cholangiocarcinoma cell line BDEneu (20), BDEneu
tumor–associated myoﬁbroblasts (rCAF; ref. 21), and quiescent rat ﬁbroblasts (rFB) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS,
penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) under
standard conditions. Cell lines were authenticated in June
(HuCCT-1, MzChA-1, KMCH, KMBC) and July 2011 (LX-2) by
Genetica DNA Laboratories using an AmpF/STR Identiﬁler
kit and GeneMapper v3.2 software. Three primary human
cholangiocarcinoma-associated myoﬁbroblasts cell lines
(hCAF) were isolated and cultured. These cell lines were
obtained in full compliance and approval of the Mayo
Institutional Review Board. Brieﬂy, liver cancer tissue was
processed with the BD MediMachine (BD Biosciences).
Disaggregated cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% PLTMax (Mill Creek Life Sciences; ref. 22).
The hCAF cell lines were karyotyped to conﬁrm a normal
karyotype. Expansion media consisted of DMEM with 10%
FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin.

Immunoprecipitation of Bcl-XL and associated BH3-only
proteins
LX-2 cells were grown on 20-cm tissue culture dishes to
subconﬂuency and treated with navitoclax (1 mmol/L) for 24
hours. Cells were subsequently lysed in cold CHAPS lysis buffer
[1% CHAPS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L HEPES, 1% glycerol,
3% thiodiglycol, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF), 1 protease inhibitor mix, 100
mmol/L sodium ﬂuoride, 25 nmol/L microcystin]. Lysates were
centrifuged for 15 minutes at 15,000  g to pellet cellular debris.
Protein concentration was determined via Bradford assay.
About 400 mg of total protein was precleared by incubation
with 40 mL agarose A/G beads (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4 C.
Bcl-XL (clone N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology and control
rabbit IgG (BD Pharmingen) crosslinked beads were prepared
as previously described (23). About 40 mL of control IgG or BclXL crosslinked beads were added to the precleared 400 mg of
total lysate protein and incubated rotating overnight at 4 C.
The beads were then pelleted by 2 minutes of centrifugation at
8,000  g, washed 4 times in CHAPS lysis buffer, resuspended in
sample buffer [4 mmol/L urea, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 6.8), 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol], and
boiled for 20 minutes to release immunoprecipitated proteins.
The samples were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 8000  g, and
the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane as previously
described.
Bax activation by navitoclax
Cells were grown on glass slides and treated with navitoclax
or vehicle. Slides were then washed with PBS ﬁxed for 30
minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with
0.01% CHAPS in PBS. After a further washing, slides were
incubated with a conformation-speciﬁc antibody against activated Bax 6A7 (1:100) overnight at 4 C, washed, and incubated
with secondary antibody (goat-anti mouse Alexa 488 1:1,000;
ref. 24).
Generation of stable transfectants
HEK 293T cells were transfected with pCMV-VSV-G
(Addgene), pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (Addgene), and the lentiviral
shBax or shBak constructs (Open Biosystems, V2LHS_240441
and V2LHS_94682), respectively, using Lipofectamine LTX
reagent (Invitrogen) to amplify the shBax or shBak containing
lentivirus. Target LX-2 cells were grown to 50% conﬂuency and
infected with lentivirus-containing medium from the HEK
293T cells. Medium was previously passed through a 0.45-mm
pore ﬁlter, and polybrene (Sigma Aldrich) was then added to a
ﬁnal concentration of 8 mg/mL. LX-2 cells were incubated with
infectious medium for 3 hours before medium was replaced
with fresh noninfectious medium. Infection was again repeated
24 hours after the initial exposure. Infected LX-2 cells were split
into selection medium containing 10 mg/mL puromycin. Cell
lysates were prepared from shBax and shBak cells to conﬁrm
knockdown of Bax or Bak protein by Western blotting. Stably
transfected shMcl-1 KMCH clones were generated as previously described in detail (25). LX-2 cells were stably transfected

described for HuH-7 cells (26). The S-tag results in a slight
increase in molecular weight for Mcl-1, which can readily be
identiﬁed by immunoblot analysis to verify stable expression of
the protein.

rats (Harlan) with initial mean body weights ranging
between 180 and 230 g, as we have previously described in

Results
Navitoclax selectively induces myoﬁbroblast apoptosis
CAFs are characterized by the expression of a-smooth
muscle actin (a-SMA) as a hallmark of the myoﬁbroblast
phenotype and expression plus secretion of Ten C protein
(4, 28). We conﬁrmed a-SMA and Ten C and mRNA expression
in hCAFs, human liver–derived myoﬁbroblastic LX-2 cell line,

and their shBAX- and shBAK-modiﬁed clones, as well as the
absence of these markers in quiescent hFBs and human
cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). Next,
we examined the potential, single-agent, proapoptotic effects
of navitoclax on hCAFs, LX-2, and hFBs (Fig. 1A). As assessed by
both morphologic and biochemical criteria, navitoclax
markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAF and LX-2 cells,
whereas quiescent ﬁbroblasts were resistant to navitoclax
cytotoxicity. To conﬁrm that CAFs were in fact undergoing
caspase-dependent apoptosis, the pan-caspase inhibitor QVD
was used. QVD (5 mmol/L) effectively reduced navitoclax
induced apoptosis in CAF cells (<5% apoptotic cells after 48
hours of 1 mmol/L navitoclax treatment; data not shown). In

Therapeutic Deletion of CAFs in Cholangiocarcinoma

(ref. 25; Fig. 2B). Bax was consistently upregulated in the
myoﬁbroblasts as compared with quiescent ﬁbroblasts (Fig.
2A), which is likely due to posttranslational regulatory differences, as Bax mRNA levels were similar between quiescent
ﬁbroblasts and the activated phenotype (data not shown). LX-2
cells also displayed an increase of activated Bax compared with
quiescent ﬁbroblasts following navitoclax treatment (Fig. 2C).
Finally, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-targeted knockdown of
Bax but not Bak reduced navitoclax-induced cytotoxicity of
myoﬁbroblastic LX-2 cells (Fig. 2D). Although Mcl-1 has been
previously identiﬁed as a resistance factor for navitoclax
cytotoxicity (30), we further veriﬁed the effect of Mcl-1 on
navitoclax sensitivity in our paradigms (Fig. 3). shRNA knockdown of Mcl-1 in KMCH cells sensitized the cancer cells to
navitoclax-mediated apoptosis. Conversely, enforced expression of Mcl-1 in LX-2 cells rendered these cells resistant to
navitoclax-induced cell killing. Collectively, these observations
suggest that the absence of Mcl-1 expression, and the increase
in Bax protein levels contributes to the sensitivity of CAFs to
navitoclax-mediated apoptosis.

contrast to the myoﬁbroblasts, human cholangiocarcinoma
cells were relatively resistant to navitoclax-mediated cell death
(Fig. 1B, top and bottom), although the HuCCT-1 cell line
displayed a moderate increase in caspase-3/7 activity following
exposure to navitoclax. The partial sensitivity of HuCCT-1 cells
to navitoclax-induced apoptosis may be due to their enhanced
Bax plus reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expression altering the
complex balance of anti- and proapoptotic regulators (Supplementary Fig. S2). Finally, treatment of quiescent ﬁbroblasts
with TGF-b not only resulted in their activation, as observed by
induction of a-SMA expression, but also sensitized these cells
to navitoclax-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken together, these data suggest navitoclax selectively induces
apoptosis in CAFs as compared with cholangiocarcinoma cells.
CAFs do not express Mcl-1 and upregulate Bax
We next explored the potential mechanisms resulting in
selective CAF sensitivity to navitoclax-mediated apoptosis. We
ﬁrst proﬁled CAFs for antiapoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1), proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
(Bax and Bak), and BH3-only proteins (Bad, Bim, Bid, Noxa, and
PUMA; Fig. 2A). Expression of these proteins was quite variable
between the different cell lines. Interestingly, Mcl-1, a known
resistance factor for navitoclax cytotoxicity (29), was minimally
expressed by CAFs or even quiescent ﬁbroblasts, although it
was expressed by cholangiocarcinoma, as previously described

fected. Upon navitoclax treatment, we observed substantial
Smac release from isolated cellular heavy membranes enriched
in mitochondria (Fig. 4A) as well as into the cytoplasm of whole
cells (Fig. 4B). However, Smac release was not observed in
shBax cells (Fig. 4C). Mitochondria from cholangiocarcinoma
cells did not display release of apoptogenic factors upon
exposure to navitoclax (Fig. 4D). Finally, consistent with being

reconcile these observations, we postulated that CAF
mitochondria were primed for cell death (32). Mitochondrial
priming refers to the empiric observation that activated or
transformed cells have a reduced threshold for BH3 peptide- or
BH3 mimetic–induced mitochondrial release of apoptogenic
factors such as Smac and cytochrome c (33). For these studies,
we used the LX-2 cells, given their ability to be easily trans-

Figure 4. Navitoclax selectively induces release of mitochondrial proapoptotic factors in activated myoﬁbroblasts. Heavy membranes enriched in
mitochondria were isolated from LX-2 cells and incubated with navitoclax (10 mmol/L) or vehicle. Mitochondria were separated from supernatant by
centrifugation and fractions were subject to immunoblot analysis to assay for Smac release from the mitochondria into the supernatant (A). LX-2 cells were
treated with navitoclax (1 mmol/L) and separated into cytoplasmic and mitochondria-containing fractions (pellet—loading control) by differential centrifugation
after selective digitonin permeabilization. Fractions were analyzed for Smac and cytochrome c by immunoblotting (B). Cytoplasmic- and mitochondriacontaining fractions (pellet) of shBax and shBak LX-2 cells and human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines MzChA-1 and HuCCT-1 treated with navitoclax (1 mmol/L)
are shown in C and D, respectively. Note in these short-term incubation studies, the pool of cytochrome c and/or Smac released was limited and did not
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the amount of these proteins in the pellet. hFBs, LX-2, shBax LX-2, and Mz-ChA-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells were treated with
navitoclax or vehicle for 24 hours. After tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, 100 nmol/L) loading, cells were analyzed for mitochondrial depolarization
and subsequent loss of ﬂuorescence by ﬂow cytometry. TMRM ﬂuorescence (excitation wavelength, 544 nm) intensity was measured in 50,000 cells (E).

primed for cell death, the LX-2 cells, but not quiescent ﬁbroblasts, nor cholangiocarcinoma cells underwent mitochondrial
membrane depolarization following navitoclax treatment and
this effect was abolished in shBax LX-2 cells (Fig. 4E). To further
examine mechanisms responsible for this observed priming,
mitochondrial-enriched heavy membrane fractions obtained
from cholangiocarcinoma, LX-2, and hCAF cells were proﬁled
for activator BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bim, and Puma), and Bax
and Bak by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A). Increased Bax, Bid,
and Bim were identiﬁed in the mitochondrial fraction of
myoﬁbroblasts but not cholangiocarcinoma cells. In accordance with other studies of priming (30), navitoclax treatment
of LX-2 cells decreased Bim binding to Bcl-XL as examined by
immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 5B). These observations
support the concept that the activated state of CAFs is associated with translocation of Bax and BH3-only proteins
to mitochondria. The presence of Bim association with BclXL in the presence of Bax on mitochondria supports an
embedded together model that primes the cells for cell death
by navitoclax (13).
Navitoclax reduces tumor burden and metastasis in vivo
To ascertain whether the effects of navitoclax on CAFs from
cholangiocarcinoma observed in vitro may be translated to an
in vivo model, we used a syngeneic, orthotopic rodent model of
cholangiocarcinoma (34). First, cytotoxicity assays for the used
BDEneu tumor cells and rCAFs previously isolated from
orthotopic rat tumors were conducted analogous to the previous assays with human cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A and
S4B). These studies showed that rat CAFs, similar to human
CAFs, are more sensitive to navitoclax than the corresponding
cancer cells. To also conﬁrm that the stromal composition in
this animal model was comparable with human cholangiocarcinoma (28), we conducted immunoﬂuorescence for CAFderived Ten C, an extracellular matrix protein produced by
myoﬁbroblasts, and a-SMA, a marker of the activated myoﬁbroblast phenotype (3). Cytokeratin (CK) 7 was used to identify
cholangiocarcinoma cells and distinguish them from the CAFs.

www.aacrjournals.org

Indeed, the rodent cholangiocarcinoma was associated with
extensive tumor desmoplasia which strongly expressed CAF
markers (Fig. 6A). We then asked, whether navitoclax treatment induces CAF cytotoxicity in vivo. Animals were treated
with navitoclax for 48 hours, 7 days after tumor implantation.
TUNEL assays were then conducted with dual labeling for aSMA and cytokeratin 7 to assess for terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive/a-SMA (CAF) and/or TUNEL-positive/CK7 cells (cholangiocarcinoma cells). The number of a-SMA–positive cells
which were TUNEL-positive was increased compared with
tumors from vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 6B) and was greater
than the TUNEL-positive/CK7 cells. Consistent with this observation, there was also a net reduction in quantitative immunoﬂuorescence staining for the tumor stroma markers a-SMA
and Ten C (Fig. 6C). This observation was also conﬁrmed by
quantitative analysis of a-SMA and Ten C mRNA expression in
the tumor samples (Fig. 6D). Finally, we examined the potential
tumor-suppressing effect of navitoclax treatment in this model. In vehicle- and navitoclax-treated rats, tumor weight and
metastases were examined after 10 days of treatment, initiated
7 days after tumor implantation. Mean gross tumor wet weight
(Fig. 7A) and mean tumor:liver weight ratio (Fig. 7B) were
reduced in the navitoclax-treated animals. Peritoneal metastases were also reduced in this group (Fig. 7C). The navitoclax
treatment–associated tumor suppressive effects also translated into an improved animal survival (Fig. 7D). The morphometric analysis revealed an altered tumor composition after 10
days of treatment, namely, a reduction in the ratio of a-SMAand Ten C–positive stroma to tumor area (Fig. 7E). Histologically, the tumors appeared less desmoplastic with larger
contiguous areas of tumor cells rather than isolated tumor
glands typical for cholangiocarcinoma (Fig. 7F). Finally, we
were also able to show Bax activation and loss of mitochondrial
Smac in CAFs following navitoclax treatment for 48 hours,
thereby suggesting the mechanisms of navitoclax-mediated
CAF cytotoxicity in vivo parallels that observed in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, these observations

indicate that (i) liver CAFs display sensitivity to single-agent

of CAFs to navitoclax is associated with enhanced Bax

(iii) targeting CAFs for cell death in the tumor microenvironment is therapeutic in a syngeneic rodent in vivo model

Navitoclax

Navitoclax mimics the binding characteristics of the BH3only protein Bad and like Bad does not bind to the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 (14); indeed, Mcl-1 expression is a
well-documented resistance factor for navitoclax (29). Given
that cholangiocarcinoma expresses Mcl-1 (25), their resistance to navitoclax is not surprising. However, resistance to
navitoclax is unlikely to be mediated solely by a single Bcl-2
protein given the complexity of the interactions between
pro- and antiapoptotic members of this family. For example,
the HuCCT cells displayed partial sensitivity to navitoclax
despite Mcl-1 expression, likely due to their increased Bax
plus reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expression. Alternatively, lack
of Mcl-1 phosphorylation at Ser-64 in these cells could
potentially explain the insufﬁciency of Mcl-1 in preventing
navitoclax cytotoxicity (35).

www.aacrjournals.org

The absence of Mcl-1 expression by CAFs was unexpected
but partially explains their sensitivity to navitoclax-mediated
apoptosis. The mechanism for silencing Mcl-1 expression by
CAFs is beyond the scope of this study, given the complexity of
Mcl-1 regulation (36). Because navitoclax cannot directly
activate Bax or Bak, the absence of Mcl-1 expression is not
sufﬁcient to explain the sensitivity of CAFs to navitoclax killing.
Indeed, quiescent ﬁbroblasts were also resistant to navitoclax
cytotoxicity despite their lacking of Mcl-1 expression. These
observations suggest that CAFs may also be primed for cell
death.
In one model, mitochondrial priming is considered to be a
state in which the capacity of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to
sequester proapoptotic BH3-only proteins or bind Bax/Bak is
almost completely exhausted (32). In this situation, minimal

shifts of the Bcl-2 equilibrium can cause cells to rapidly enter
apoptosis (37). By binding to the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, navitoclax displaces sequestered BH3 proteins such as Bim from these antiapoptotic proteins and
enables them to activate Bax and Bak, inducing apoptosis
(14). Indeed, we were able to show Bim displacement from BclXL following navitoclax treatment in our current studies. In an
alternative model, coined the "embedded together" model,
antiapoptotic proteins inhibit not only BH3-only proteins but
also Bax or Bak all embedded within the outer mitochondrial
membrane (13, 14) In this model, BH3 mimetics may alter
binding between the various Bcl-2–binding polypeptides
allowing Bax or Bak activation and MOMP. Our data are
perhaps most consistent with an embedded together model
as we observed that Bim and Bax were already associated with
mitochondria under basal conditions in myoﬁbroblasts. Following navitoclax treatment, Bim was released from Bcl-XL
suggesting that BH3 mimetic altered the complex binding
dynamics in the membrane in such a manner as to favor Bax
activation and MOMP.
In our in vivo studies, despite the more prominent cytotoxic
effects on CAFs as than cholangiocarcinoma cells, navitoclax
treatment was sufﬁcient to markedly reduce tumor size. These
observations support the concept that tumor stroma is crucial
for tumor development and even metastasis (38). Quantitative
depletion of CAFs from the stroma by navitoclax also reduced
the expression of typical components of the tumor extracellular matrix, such as Ten C, a protein recently found to support
cancer growth (6, 39, 40). Thus, therapeutic induction of CAF
apoptosis can be coupled to a decrease in tumor-promoting
components of the extracellular matrix. The noticeable reduction in metastasis might be a result of this depletion particularly of Ten C from the microenvironment, which has just
recently been described as important matrix component of the
metastatic niche (6, 41).
In this study, we used cholangiocarcinoma as a model of a
highly desmoplastic cancer containing abundant CAFs and
tumor-speciﬁc extracellular matrix (4). This cancer is similar to
other desmoplastic cancers, such as prostate, breast, and
pancreatic cancer, where tumor stroma contributes to tumor
development and progression (42, 43). Thus, the results of this
study not only are germane to cholangiocarcinoma but also

may provide information relevant to desmoplastic cancers in
general (2, 44). While cancer therapy targeting the cancer cells
becomes increasingly more individualized, reﬂecting the multitude of genetic and cell biologic alterations an individual
tumor may present, the stromal reaction of the organism
appears more uniform across many different types of malignancies (45). This suggests the tumor stroma to be a viable and
attractive target for combination anti-cancer therapy. Our
results further suggest that CAF priming to select proapoptotic
therapies targeting this cell population represents a novel
anticancer strategy. In this regard, navitoclax may be a clinically relevant therapeutic agent.
