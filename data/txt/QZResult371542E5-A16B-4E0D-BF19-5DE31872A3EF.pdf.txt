Abstract
Altered expression of the INT6 gene, encoding the e subunit of the translational initiation factor eIF3, occurs in
human breast cancers, but how INT6 relates to carcinogenesis remains unestablished. Here, we show that INT6 is
involved in the DNA damage response. INT6 was required for cell survival following g-irradiation and G2–M
checkpoint control. RNA interference–mediated silencing of INT6 reduced phosphorylation of the checkpoint
kinases CHK1 and CHK2 after DNA damage. In addition, INT6 silencing prevented sustained accumulation of
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) at DNA damage sites in cells treated with g-radiation or the radiomimetic
drug neocarzinostatin. Mechanistically, this result could be explained by interaction of INT6 with ATM, which
together with INT6 was recruited to the sites of DNA damage. Finally, INT6 silencing also reduced ubiquitylation
events that promote retention of repair proteins at DNA lesions. Accordingly, accumulation of the repair factor
BRCA1 was defective in the absence of INT6. Our ﬁndings reveal unexpected and striking connections of INT6
with ATM and BRCA1 and suggest that the protective action of INT6 in the onset of breast cancers relies on its
involvement in the DNA damage response. Cancer Res; 72(8); 2006–16. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells initiate a
complex signaling pathway called DNA damage response
(DDR; refs. 1, 2). At the core of DDR is the kinase ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM; ref. 3). As a part of its activation
process, ATM undergoes autophosphorylation, relocalizes rapidly to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) through its
association with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex
(4, 5), and phosphorylates numerous substrates including
histone H2AX. Chromatin marked with phosphorylated H2AX
(referred to as g-H2AX) establishes a chromatin domain onto
which DDR proteins accumulate, among them ATM, MRN
components, and MDC1. MDC1 phosphorylated by ATM then
recruits the RNF8 ubiquitin ligase, which in turn catalyzes local
ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones, thereby facilitating accumulation of repair complexes, including BRCA1 (6–8).

Most of the known breast cancer susceptibility genes
reported to date code for proteins involved in maintaining
genome stability by engaging in DDR pathway. These genes
include the prototypic BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes; of which
inherited mutations were found to confer an approximately
15-fold increased risk of breast cancer (9). ATM mutations
confer a moderate risk (doubling) of breast cancer in relative
heterozygous carriers; however, the risk is elevated for certain
missense variants of ATM (T7271G and L1420F) because these
alleles are sufﬁciently penetrant to generate multiple case
breast cancer families (10–13). Inherited mutations in the gene
encoding checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a major signal transducer of DDR, are associated with an approximately 2-fold
increased risk of breast cancer incidence (14, 15). The 3 MRE11,
RAD50, and NBS1 genes are all considered as hereditary breast
cancer susceptibility genes as well (16–18). However, approximately 70% of familial breast cancers remain unexplained by
currently known predisposition genes, suggestive of existence
of other breast cancer susceptibility genes.
The integration site 6 (INT6) gene, also known as EIF3E,
encodes 1 of the 13 subunits of human eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 3 (eIF3; ref. 19). Several lines of evidence
indicate that this gene is critical for preventing breast carcinogenesis in mice and humans. Concerning this matter, various roles were proposed for INT6 either as an oncoprotein
(20–22) or as a tumor suppressor (23–25). In this study, we have
discovered that INT6 is involved in the DDR pathway. Specifically, silencing INT6 decreases cell survival after exposure to
g-irradiation and impairs the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. A
fraction of INT6 localizes rapidly to DSB sites and interacts
with ATM. Moreover, the ability of ATM to remain at breaks is
reduced in INT6-depleted cells. As a consequence, several

components operating at different levels of DDR are not
recruited efﬁciently to DSB sites, including the repair factor
BRCA1. Because the bulk of breast cancer susceptibility genes
discovered to date encode proteins involved in DDR, our
results establishing a role for INT6 in this pathway pave the
way for large epidemiologic and molecular studies to assess the
potential clinical outcome of INT6 defects in breast cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection
HeLa and 293T cells were obtained from European Collection of Cell Cultures and U2OS cells from American Type
Culture Collection. They were repeatedly screened for mycoplasma and were negative. HeLa cells were passaged for less
than 6 months. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 293T cells were
transfected with a standard calcium phosphate method. HeLa
and U2OS cells were transfected with short interfering RNAs
(siRNA) and plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Unless mentioned, all assays were conducted 72 hours after
transfection. Control and INT6-speciﬁc siRNAs (I6.1 and I6.3)
have been described previously (26). The FLAG-ATM construct
(27, 28) was obtained from M. Kastan (St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital, Memphis, TN).
Immunoprecipitations and immunoblots
Transfected 293T cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40-desoxycholate buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4); 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Na desoxycholate, 0.5 mmol/L Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 0.5 mmol/L Pefabloc]. For the interaction between endogenous proteins, HeLa cells were lysed in
50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 120 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and
protease inhibitors (Roche). Extracts were incubated for 2
hours at 4 C with antibodies, then with Protein A agarose for
1 hour, and washed 3 times for 10 minutes before resuspension
in 2 SDS sample buffer. Cell extracts used only for immunoblotting were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins
were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. Blots were developed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) or ECL plus reagents (GE
Healthcare) or were analyzed with the Odyssey Infrared Imager
(LI-COR Biosciences).
In vitro binding assays
In vitro protein interaction between GST-ATM fusion proteins and INT6 was conducted as described (29). In brief,
extracts from cells untreated or g-irradiated were mixed with
glutathione agarose beads containing GST-ATM fusion proteins. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with
anti-INT6 antibody, and levels of GST-ATM fragments were
detected by Coomassie staining.
Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy
Cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes,
incubated in 100 mmol/L glycine for 10 minutes, permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes, and blocked with 1%

www.aacrjournals.org

bovine serum albumin for 30 minutes. Primary antibodies were
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4 C,
and secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or
Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen) were incubated for 1 hour. Slides
were mounted in medium containing Mowiol and observed
with a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging,
Inc.) mounted on an Axioplan2 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.)
equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63/1.4 NA (numerical
aperture) oil immersion objective. Acquisitions were conducted under constant settings. Colocalization was evaluated
by visual inspection of signal overlap on merged images or by
using the Colocalization Highlighter plug-in of ImageJ software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD). Threshold settings were automatically
set with the threshold tool and assigned to the input window of
the Colocalization Highlighter plug-in. The ratio of intensity
was set at 50%. Two points are considered as colocalized if their
respective intensities are higher than the threshold of their
channels and if their ratio of intensity is higher than 50%.
Live cell imaging combined with laser microirradiation
U2OS cells were microirradiated with a pulsed nitrogen laser
(365 nm, 10 Hz; Spectra-Physics) with output set at 80% of the
maximum, as described previously (30). For live cell imaging,
cells were transfected with a GFP-ATM construct, laser microirradiated, time lapse imaged, and ﬂuorescence intensities of
microirradiated areas relative to nonirradiated areas calculated as described previously (31).
Antibodies
Antibodies to INT6 (C-169 for immunoﬂuorescence and C20 for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting) have been
described previously (32) as well as those directed against
EIF3D and EIF3L (33). Commercial antibodies are listed in
Supplementary Materials.

Results
INT6 is essential for cell survival and G2–M checkpoint
following g-irradiation
To understand how altered expression of INT6 prevents
breast cancer onset, we explored whether INT6 is involved in
the activation of DNA damage signaling pathway. First, the
sensitivity of INT6-silenced cells to different doses of g-irradiation (IR) was assessed with an MTT-based assay. Compared with control siRNA–treated cells, INT6-depleted cells
showed a decreased survival rate after IR with a dose–
response curve similar to that obtained for ATM-silenced
cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined whether INT6 was
involved in the G2–M DNA damage checkpoint. Flow cytometric analyses with DNA content and phosphorylatedhistone H3 to distinguish between G2 and mitotic cells were
conducted. Control cells showed a clear G2–M block, as
evidenced by an 8-fold decrease in the percentage of mitotic
cells after IR (Fig. 1B). In contrast, INT6-deﬁcient cells
displayed a less robust G2–M block as g-radiation reduced
the percentage of M phase cells by only 2- to 3-fold. Together, these results indicate that INT6 is critical for proper DNA
damage signaling.

INT6 is required for sustained accumulation of ATM to
DNA damage sites
To further understand the involvement of INT6 in DDR, we
investigated whether the ATM kinase, essential for cellular
signaling in response to DNA damage, was normally activated
upon INT6 deﬁciency. First, the phosphorylation status of its
substrate CHK2 was examined. As expected, irradiation of
control siRNA–treated cells led to a rapid and optimal phosphorylation of CHK2 within 30 minutes after irradiation that
signiﬁcantly decreased by 2 hours (Fig. 2A). In contrast, INT6depleted cells failed to show similar levels of increase at 30
minutes or at a later time point. This defect in CHK2 phosphorylation was not caused by a reduction in CHK2 protein
levels (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase
CHK1 was also reduced in these cells (Fig. 2A). Activation of
these 2 kinases was similarly impaired in cells depleted of INT6
by means of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and treated with the
radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin (Fig. 2B). The rescue of
INT6 expression with an INT6 cDNA resistant to degradation
by shRNA restored the levels of CHK2 and CHK1 phosphorylation in these cells to control levels (Fig. 2B). Of note, the
kinetics of phosphorylation of the 2 kinases is different; CHK2
showed maximal phosphorylation within 30 minutes and
CHK1 at 2 hours. Next, ATM activation was assessed by
immunoblotting using an antibody to Ser1981-autophosphorylated ATM. The ATM active form was detected after but not
before g-irradiation and silencing INT6 caused a slight
decrease in the levels of phosphorylated ATM (Fig. 3A). The
impact of INT6 depletion on ATM activation was further
studied by immunoﬂuorescent analyses. As expected, g-irradiation of control cells induced local accumulation of active
ATM in nuclear foci (Fig. 3B). Formation of these ATM nuclear
foci was impaired in INT6-silenced cells. A signal was also
visible in the cytoplasm of these cells. However, speciﬁcity of
this staining is questionable as it was also observed in nonirradiated cells (Fig. 3B), which showed no signal for phosphorylated ATM by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). Speciﬁcity of the
nuclear staining was established by its disappearance when the
cells were transfected with siRNAs against ATM (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Formation of ATM foci was also assessed in cells
treated with neocarzinostatin. Again, silencing INT6 impaired
the accumulation of ATM to g-H2AX foci (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). To rule out any effect speciﬁc to HeLa cells, localization of
ATM was studied in immortalized human ﬁbroblasts treated
with neocarzinostatin and again ATM was not properly
retained at DSBs in the absence of INT6 (Supplementary Fig.
S1C). To elucidate this defect, real-time recruitment of ATM
tagged with GFP was monitored by live cell imaging combined
with laser microirradiation as previously described (30, 31).
U2OS cells expressing GFP-ATM were transfected with control
or INT6-targeting siRNAs and a small area of the nucleus was
laser microirradiated to generate DSBs. Time lapse imaging of
control cells showed that GFP-ATM, which was nuclear diffuse
before irradiation, became rapidly recruited to DSBs (within 1
minute) and accumulated progressively before reaching a
plateau at approximately 20 minutes (Fig. 3C and D). In
INT6-silenced cells, recruitment of GFP-ATM to DSBs was
weaker and reached a plateau at approximately 5 minutes after

microirradiation (Fig. 3C and D). Similarly, recruitment of
endogenous phospho-ATM along the laser track was impaired
following INT6 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S1D). In line
with these data, biochemical fractionation of HeLa cells
exposed to neocarzinostatin showed that loss of INT6 led to
decreased levels of chromatin-bound ATM (Fig. 3E). Of note, no
phospho-ATM signal was detected in cytoplasmic fractions of
INT6-depleted cells, thus arguing against localization of the
ATM active form in the cytoplasm. Because MDC1 is necessary
for ATM retention at DSBs (34), kinetics of MDC1 recruitment
to laser tracks was analyzed and was similar with or without
INT6 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating that the
defective accumulation of ATM in the absence of INT6 was not
due to an impaired localization of MDC1 at DSBs.
INT6 localizes to sites of DSBs generated by
neocarzinostatin treatment or laser microirradiation
To elucidate how INT6 might regulate ATM function, we
ﬁrst examined whether INT6 could be localized at DSB sites. In
the vast majority of mock-treated cells, no g-H2AX foci was
detected and INT6 was dispersed in the cytoplasm and nucleus
(Fig. 4A). Of note, INT6 staining seems only nuclear because the
cytoplasm did not lie in this confocal plane. In neocarzinostatin-treated cells, a substantial fraction of the nuclear pool of

www.aacrjournals.org

INT6 was concentrated into foci colocalized with that of
g-H2AX. Speciﬁcity of the INT6 signal was established by its
disappearance in the cells transfected with an siRNA targeting
INT6. Next, kinetics of INT6 recruitment to DSBs was monitored by time lapse microscopy of cells subjected to microirradiation. Localization of INT6 along the laser track was
detected within 5 minutes after microirradiation and kinetics
of INT6 accumulation was similar to that of g-H2AX (Fig. 4B).
The INT6 signal at laser-induced DSBs was signiﬁcantly attenuated upon INT6 depletion (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B).
We also found that ATM activity was not required for recruitment of INT6 at DSBs as INT6 was localized to laser tracks
normally in cells treated with the ATM inhibitor KU55933 (Fig.
4C and Supplementary Fig. S3C) or in ATM-deﬁcient cells (Fig.
4D). Together, these ﬁndings suggest that INT6 is directly
involved in DDR at DSB sites and that it is recruited independently of ATM.
INT6 interacts physically with ATM
The above results together with our observation showing
that INT6 colocalized with ATM at DNA damage sites
(Supplementary Fig. S4) suggested that a fraction of INT6
might interact physically with ATM. This was tested by
immunoprecipitation assays. Copuriﬁcation of exogenous

strongly to GST-ATM (residues 1,764–2,138 and 2,842–3,056),
but not the other fusion proteins, and binding of INT6 did not
respond to DNA damage (Fig. 5D). These 2 ATM fragments
correspond to separate regions, one upstream of the FAT
domain and the second encompassing the FAT-C domain.
INT6 activity in DDR does not involve translation
A striking aspect of our ﬁndings is that one subunit of the
eIF3 translation initiation factor can interact with one crucial
kinase of DDR. In this regard, the bulk of eIF3 and translation
machinery are mainly cytoplasmic, whereas INT6 shuttles
between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in human cells (36).
We therefore tested the possibility that INT6 might be released
from eIF3 during conditions of DNA damage. Copuriﬁcation
with INT6 of 5 other eIF3 subunits was examined and their
recovery was similar with or without prior exposure of cells to
neocarzinostatin (Fig. 6A). In addition, cytoplasmic INT6 levels
associated with the EIF3B subunit were comparable with or
without neocarzinostatin treatment (Fig. 6B), thus suggesting
that the fraction of INT6 associated with eIF3 is not affected by

2012

Cancer Res; 72(8) April 15, 2012

DNA damage. Next, to determine whether INT6 effect on DDR
was related to a translational activity, we ﬁrst tested the ability
of ATM to localize at DSBs after inhibition of translation with
cycloheximide. Immunoﬂuorescent analyses showed that
ATM was normally recruited to neocarzinostatin-induced
DSBs (Fig. 6C). Moreover, silencing INT6 had no signiﬁcant
effect on the separation of ribosomal components and polysomes after DNA damage (Fig. 6D). Together, these ﬁndings
suggest that the altered functioning of ATM following INT6
suppression is not likely due to an INT6-mediated translational
effect. As 2 recent studies on the impact of INT6 depletion
on protein synthesis in human cells pointed that it is not
required for global translation but for regulating translation of
speciﬁc mRNAs (25, 37), we studied whether INT6 knockdown
could interfere with the translation of mRNAs encoding DDR
proteins and ubiquitin under DNA damage conditions.
Using the NanoString nCounter Technology (38, 39), we found
that the relative abundances of selected DDR transcripts and
the 4 ubiquitin-coding mRNAs varied with a fold change
ranging from 0.6 to 1.5 in INT6-depleted cells treated with

Figure 7. INT6 is required for an efﬁcient DDR. A–C, HeLa cells transfected with siRNAs were treated with neocarzinostatin (200 ng/mL, 15 minutes)
and immunostained 3 hours posttreatment with antibodies to g-H2AX and Ser343-phosphorylated NBS1 (p-NBS1; A), conjugated ubiquitin (FK2 antibody; B),
and BRCA1 (C). Approximately 30 cells were acquired for each cell population and experiments were repeated at least twice. Representative confocal
images shown were processed as in Fig. 6C. D, ﬂuorescence intensities of g-H2AX, phospho-NBS1, ubiquitin, and BRCA1 labeling were measured
within the entire nucleus (Total) and within g-H2AX foci (Foci). Ten nuclei from control cells and from INT6-deﬁcient cells were analyzed for each experiment.

neocarzinostatin, and these minor variations were common to
both polysomal and total RNAs (Fig. 6E and Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). However, as these variations mostly impact
on transcripts encoding the 3 components of the MRN complex, which is the DSB sensor that recruits ATM at the break, we
analyzed by immunoblotting their corresponding protein
levels that result from coupling of protein synthesis and
degradation. Silencing of INT6 did not modulate overall protein abundance of MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 regardless of
whether cells were treated, or not, with neocarzinostatin
(Supplementary Fig. S5). From these data, we concluded
that INT6 does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the translational

efﬁciencies of the transcripts selected here. Together, our
results are consistent with a role for INT6 in DDR unrelated
to translation.
INT6 facilitates ATM signaling
Because ATM acts very early in DDR and fails to properly
relocalize to DSB sites following INT6 depletion, we addressed
the consequences of this impairment on the correct assembly of
DDR factors. We ﬁrst examined the phosphorylation of the
ATM downstream target NBS1. Phospho-NBS1 was mainly
detected after, but not before, exposure to neocarzinostatin,
and its overall abundance did not seem to be modiﬁed after

Role of INT6/EIF3E in DNA Damage Response

INT6 deﬁciency (Supplementary Fig. S5). We then tested whether it was localized at DSBs. By visual inspection, phospho-NBS1
signal within g-H2AX foci seemed to be reduced in the vast
majority of INT6-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 7A). This was conﬁrmed by
measuring ﬂuorescence intensity that showed a 47% decrease
of phospho-NBS1 labeling in g-H2AX foci (Fig. 7D). The signal in
the entire nuclear compartment was also reduced by 31%, in
agreement with an ATM defect in INT6-depleted cells. We next
examined whether INT6 knockdown interfered with the DNA
damage–induced ubiquitin signaling pathway, which ubiquitylates histones and promotes the recruitment at DSBs of essential repair factors, including BRCA1 (6–8). The formation of
ubiquitin conjugates was investigated by immunostaining by
the anti-ubiquitin FK2 antibody. Total nuclear ubiquitin signal
was normal but ubiquitin intensity in g-H2AX foci was reduced
by 36% when INT6 was silenced (Fig. 7B and D). Consistent with
this ubiquitin pathway being compromised, BRCA1 labeling,
which remained unchanged in the whole nucleus, was also
attenuated by 36% in g-H2AX foci upon INT6 silencing (Fig. 7C
and D). It should be noted that g-H2AX intensities were normal
in these cells. Collectively, these results show that INT6, by
stabilizing ATM at DSBs, facilitates ATM downstream signaling
upon DNA damage.

analysis aiming at identifying PIKK substrates (42) reported
the phosphorylation on Thr439 of the murine protein, but no
phosphorylation was found for human INT6 in this work as well
as in other studies (42–44). We also searched for such a
modiﬁcation by various experimental approaches but failed to
identify INT6 as an ATM substrate. Also, the interaction of INT6
with ATM was not induced by DNA damage, and importantly,
recruitment of INT6 at DSBs was normal when ATM kinase
activity was inhibited and in the AT5 cell line, which lacks ATM.
Collectively, these data support the notion that ATM is not
required for INT6 recruitment at DNA breaks. Of note, proteasome is recruited at DSBs and is required for efﬁcient DNA
repair (45, 46). Future studies should help to determine whether
INT6 acts on its own or as part of a macromolecular complex to
stabilize ATM at DSBs.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings show that INT6 is involved in
early stages of DDR and provides a molecular basis to the
protective role of INT6 in breast cancer onset. Furthermore, by
linking INT6 suppression to a BRCA1 deﬁciency, these observations might help in the identiﬁcation of genetic markers that
would predict sensitivity to novel PARP-1 inhibitors, which
exploit the concept of synthetic lethality and that are so far
limited to BRCA1/2-mutated tumors (47, 48).

Discussion

Disclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of Interest

Besides its association with eIF3, INT6 also binds to subunits
of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) and the 26S proteasome lid (40),
2 complexes that regulate proteolysis. These 3 protein assemblies are referred to as PCI (Proteasome lid, CSN, and eIF3)
complexes, because a conserved motif was found in subunits of
these complexes. Proteins harboring such a PCI domain, including INT6, are thought to serve as structural scaffolds (41). Our
results strongly suggest that INT6 does not function in DDR
together with eIF3 through regulating translation of mRNAs
encoding DDR components. In this regard, a recent study that
measured mRNA and protein abundance for more than 5,000
genes in mammalian cells provides valuable information about
stoichiometry of protein complexes (35). For INT6, the average
protein copy number per cell was estimated to be more than 2fold that of other subunits of eIF3. This is fully consistent with
the notion that INT6, beyond acting with the eIF3 complex,
fulﬁls other functions in the cell. Our results indicate that INT6
is likely to have a direct role in DDR; this is supported by its
rapid recruitment at DSBs and by its capacity to interact with
ATM. The nature of the signal that triggers this localization of
INT6 remains unclear. Phosphorylation of INT6 by ATM is a
tempting possibility, as INT6 harbors 2 phosphatidylinositol 3kinase-related kinase (PIKK) consensus motifs at Ser415 and
Thr439. In line with this speculation, a large-scale proteomic
