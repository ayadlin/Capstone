Abstract

Author Manuscript

Macrophages abundantly found in the tumor microenvironment enhance malignancy1. At
metastatic sites a distinct population of metastasis associated macrophages (MAMs) promote
tumor cell extravasation, seeding and persistent growth2. Our study has defined the origin of these
macrophages by showing Gr1+ inflammatory monocytes (IMs) are preferentially recruited to
pulmonary metastases but not primary mammary tumors, a process also found for human IMs in
pulmonary metastases of human breast cancer cells. The recruitment of these CCR2 (receptor for
chemokine CCL2) expressing IMs and subsequently MAMs and their interaction with
metastasizing tumor cells is dependent on tumor and stromal synthesized CCL2 (FigS1).
Inhibition of CCL2/CCR2 signaling using anti-CCL2 antibodies blocks IM recruitment and
inhibits metastasis in vivo and prolongs the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Depletion of tumor
cell-derived CCL2 also inhibits metastatic seeding. IMs promote tumor cell extravasation in a
process that requires monocyte-derived VEGF. CCL2 expression and macrophage infiltration are
correlated with poor prognosis and metastatic disease in human breast cancer (Fig S2)3-6. Our data
provides the mechanistic link between these two clinical associations and indicates new
therapeutic targets for treating metastatic breast disease.

To understand the origin of macrophages in primary tumors and their metastatic sites we
measured monocyte trafficking. Mouse monocytes were identified by their expression of
CD11b and CD115 (Fig. S3a) and sorted by FACS into sub-populatoins of Gr1+/Ly6C+
IMs and Gr1−/Ly6C- resident monocytes (RMs)7,8 (Fig. S3b-d). 10^5 of each monocyte
population which have similar Csf1r-GFP expression as a reporter (Fig. S3b) were
adoptively transferred9-11 into syngeneic FVB mice bearing autochthonous late stage PyMT
mammary tumors with spontaneous pulmonary metastases (Fig. 1a). 18 hours after adoptive
transfer the ratio of recovered GFP+ (Fig. S3e) IMs over RMs from the same donor were

determined to measure their relative recruitment. This indicated similar numbers of donor
cells in the blood (showing equivalent availability), but in the primary tumor RMs are
preferentially recruited while in pulmonary metastases, IMs are preferentially recruited with
greater than 3-fold enrichment (Fig. 1b). Consistent with this, a significant population of
endogenous IMs is identified in metastasis-bearing but not normal lung (Fig. S4a). This
preferential IM recruitment in lung is not observed in 7-week-old PyMT mice bearing premetastatic mammary tumors (Fig. S4b). In experimentally induced pulmonary foci of i.v.
injected Met-1 cells12, IMs are also preferentially recruited (Fig. S4c). GFP labeled cells are
readily detectable in pulmonary metastases 5 days after transfer (data not shown) and within
two days a significant portion of them have differentiated into F4/80+CD11b+Gr1−MAMs2
that are not seen in normal lungs (Fig. S4d). To test if IMs were recruited early in the
metastasis process, we transferred monocyte populations 7 hours after i.v. injection of Met-1
cells, a time point chosen before significant tumor-macrophage interaction and tumor cell
extravasation2. Compared with control lungs, the recruitment of IMs to the tumor cellchallenged lung dramatically increased with the ratio of IMs over RMs increasing over 5fold (Fig. 1c). However, this preferential recruitment of IMs was not observed following i.v.
injection with PBS or latex beads as a control for injection or particle lodgment (data not
shown and Fig. S4e). Consistent with this early recruitment of IMs, CCR2hi MAMs were
preferentially recruited to lungs 36 hours after tumor cell inoculation2. However at this time
B cells and T cells, including Foxp3+ Treg cells were not differentially recruited (Fig. S5a-c
and data not shown). These data indicate that MAMs are derived from IMs that are
specifically recruited early during pulmonary metastases before other immune cells.

Distinct chemokine signals recruit monocytes7 with IMs responding to CCL210,11. Lung
metastases of PyMT tumor homogeneously express CCL2, in contrast to heterogeneous
expression in primary tumors (Fig. S6a-d). IMs but not RMs have high level of CCR2
expression (Fig. S6e). Neutralizing CCL2 using anti-mouse CCL2 Ab13 significantly
inhibited the recruitment of IMs to lungs challenged with metastatic tumor cells (Fig. 1d)
and the increase in MAMs to the metastatic site (Fig. S4f). Other CCR2 expressing
leukocytes (sub-population of T cell) and Treg cells in this model are unaffected by antiCCL2 Ab treatment (Fig. S5d). Furthermore, preferential recruitment of IMs to tumor cell
challenged lung was completely abrogated with adoptive transfer of monocytes sorted from
CCR2 null mutant (KO) mice (Fig. S6f).

Author Manuscript

The pattern of human monocytes recruitment in vivo to tumors is unknown. To test this,
human CD14+CD16− IMs and CD14loCD16+ RMs9 were sorted from enriched CD14+
cells from peripheral blood of healthy donors (Fig. S7a). 10^5 cells of each population were
adoptively transferred into pairs of nude mice supplemented with recombinant human CSF-1
that is essential for monocyte/macrophage survival (Fig. S7e). Human monocytes were
quantified using FACS analysis with anti-human CD45 antibody 18 hours after adoptive
transfer (Fig. S7b). In normal mice transferred with monocytes from the same donor there
are comparable numbers of human IMs and RMs in the circulation and recruited to the lung
but about twice the numbers of IMs compared to RMs in the spleen (Fig. 1e, open bars). In
mice given an i.v. injection of human MDA-MB-231-derived metastatic 4173 breast cancer
cells14 7 hours before monocyte transfer, the ratio of the two monocyte populations in blood
and spleen was similar to normal mice, but in the lungs IMs increased in ratio of >6-fold

(Fig. 1e). In established pulmonary metastases derived from orthotopically injected 4173
cells, IMs were also preferentially recruited with a 5-fold increased ratio compared to
normal lungs (Fig. S7d). Mouse IMs were also preferentially recruited to 4173 cells
challenged lungs (data not shown). Human IMs express CCR2 with RMs expressing
minimal levels of the receptor (Fig. S7c). Neutralizing host CCL2 using anti-mouse CCL2
Ab significantly reduced the recruitment of human IMs into lungs challenged with 4173
cells without change in the circulation or spleen (Fig. 1f). Treatment with an antibody
specific to human CCL215 also inhibited IM recruitment (Fig. S7f) indicating the
importance of CCL2 from both tumor and the target organ. This indicates that human IMs
respond to the same CCL2/CCR2 signaling as the mouse cells for their specific recruitment
during pulmonary metastasis

Author Manuscript

To test the effect of blocking IM recruitment on metastatic potential, we performed
experimental metastasis assays with Met-1 cells mice treated with anti-mouse CCL2 or
control Ab shortly before the tumor cell injection. This treatment reduced the total
metastasis burden due to a significantly reduced number of metastasis nodules (Fig. 2a, b).
Specific antibody to mouse CCL12, another ligand of mouse CCR2, had no effect on Met-1
cell metastasis (Fig. S8). This indicates that the specific CCL2-mediated IM recruitment is
critical for tumor cell pulmonary seeding.

Author Manuscript

Extravasation is a critical step for tumor cell metastatic seeding in lung2. We used an intact
lung imaging system16 to test the role of CCL2 recruited IMs in tumor cell extravasation.
Csf1r-EGFP transgenic mice were injected i.v. with CFP-expressing Met-1 cells and
harvested after 24 hours. Quantification of 3D reconstructed confocal images (Fig. 2c, d,
Movie S1 and S2) shows that the number of macrophages directly interacting with tumor
cells was significantly reduced by CCL2 neutralizing Ab compared with control Ab (Fig.
2e). Importantly, tumor cell extravasation was delayed and less efficient following IM
blockade (Fig. 2f). Tumor cell extravasation involves cross talk between tumor cells,
endothelial cells, basement membrane and macrophages. In an in vitro trans-endothelia
migration assay (Fig. S9a)17 tumor cell trans-endothelial migration is enhanced ~5-fold by
mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) located on the basal-lateral side of the
endothelial monolayer. This effect is blocked by anti-mouse CCL2 neutralizing antibody but
not control antibody (Fig. S9b). All three cell-types express CCL2, while only the
macrophages express CCR2 (Fig. S9c) indicating that only macrophages respond to the
CCL2 chemokine signaling. In confirmation of this macrophages from CCR2 KO mice are
not capable of promoting tumor cell trans-endothelia migration (Fig. S9d). Importantly,
FACS sorted IMs but not RMs significantly promoted tumor cell trans-endothelia migration
that was also inhibited by anti-mouse CCL2 neutralizing antibody (Fig. 2g, h).

Author Manuscript

Total CCL2 blockade (both mouse and human) inhibited spontaneous lung metastasis of
orthotopically injected MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3a). Both tumor cell and host secreted
ligands contribute to metastatic efficiency, since both anti-human and -mouse Ab alone
significantly inhibit 4173 experimental metastasis (Fig. 3b) without affecting tumor cell
proliferation in vitro (data not shown). This conclusion was also confirmed by knocking
down CCL2 using siRNAs in 4173 cells which significantly reduced lung colonization in
experimental metastasis assays (Fig. S10e, f). Consistent with this, a similar CCL2

knockdown in Met-1 cells did not affect tumor cell proliferation in vitro, but significantly
inhibited their metastastic efficiency (Fig. S10a-c). In vitro 4173 trans-endothelia migration
is also promoted by human IMs and inhibited by neutralizing either human or mouse CCL2
with specific Abs (Fig. 3c-e). These data indicate that tumor cell and target organ secreted
CCL2 work together to promote tumor cell extravasation and metastatic seeding via action
on IM recruitment. Consistent with the role of microenvironmental synthesized CCL2 in the
lung, bone metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells also recruit IMs and inhibition of CCL2
inhibits metastatic progression. In contrast liver metastasis of Met-1 cells did not recruit IMs
and CCl2 inhibition did not reduce metastasis (data not shown). Furthermore, CCL2
blockade 2 days after i.v. injection of MDA-MB-231 cells reduces lung tumor burden and
prolongs survival of mice indicating the importance of continuous recruitment of IM and
their differentiation into MAMs for persistent metastatic growth (Fig. 3f, g).

To determine mechanism of the effects of IMs on tumor cell extravasation we analyzed the
transcriptomes of RMs and IMs18. Among the differentially regulated genes VEGF is highly
expressed by IMs, a fact we verified (Fig. S11a). To conditionally ablate VEGF in myeloid
cells to test its role in the metastatic process, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing
tamoxifen inducible Mer-iCre fusion protein driven by the Csf1r promoter crossed with
VEGFflox/flox mice19. Inducible ablation of Vegf was achieved in cultured BMMs treated
with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Fig. 4a) and these Vegf KO BMMs compared to control BMM
are unable to promote tumor cell trans-endothelial migration and do not enhance
permeability of the endothelial monolayer (Fig. 4b, c), a process important for metastasis20.
In vivo injection of tamoxifen specifically ablates Vegf in monocytes without ablation in
other circulating immune cells (Fig. 4d). This monocyte–specific depletion of VEGF
significantly inhibited Met-1 cell experimental metastasis potential and seeding efficiency
(Fig. 4e and S11b). Adoptive transfer experiments indicated that Vegf KO IMs infiltrate
Met-1 lung metastasis at a comparable level as Vegfflox IMs, showing that this molecule is
not required for IM recruitment (Fig. S11c). Importantly, co-injection of Met-1 cells and
WT IMs into inducible macrophage VEGF knockout mice restored the tumor cell metastatic
potential (Fig. 4f).

Author Manuscript

Thus, these experiments have indicated that CCL2 synthesized by metastatic tumor cells and
the target site tissue stroma is critical for recruitment of a sub-population of CCR2
expressing monocytes that enhance the subsequent extravasation of the tumor cells.
Mechanistically this is at least in part through targeted delivery of molecules such as VEGF
that promote extravasation. IMs are continually recruited by a CCL2 mechanism and
differentiate into macrophages that promote the subsequent growth of metastatic cells. These
data together with the clinical associations of CCL2 over-expression in human cancer noted
above strongly argue for therapeutic approaches targeted against monocyte recruitment and
function.

Methods Summary
Monocytes trafficking into primary tumors and their metastases were studied by adoptive
transfer of mouse (Ly6C/Gr1+ or Ly6C/Gr1−) or human (CD14+CD16+ and CD16−)
monocytes using MMTV-PyMT autochthonous, human and mouse experimental metastasis

and human orthotopic tumor models. Monocytes and macrophages were recovered by
enzymatic disaggregation of the tumors followed by FACS analysis. To test mechanisms
behind monocyte recruitment and the effect of inhibition of this trafficking on metastasis
anti-mouse or human neutralizing CCL2 antibodies or Ccr2 null mutant mice were used. In
order to ablate VEGF expression in monocytes a myeloid specific (Csf1r promoter)
tamoxifen inducible Cre expressing strain was crossed with VEGFflox/flox mice and gene
ablation induced by tamoxifen. Effects of monocyte depletion on tumor cell extravasation
using Met-1, a FVB PyMT tumor derived metastatic cell line, was determined using an ex
vivo intact lung imaging system and an in vitro extravasation assay.

All procedures involving mice were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of
Health regulations concerning the use and care of experimental animals. The study of mice
was approved by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Ortho Biotech R&D Institute
Animal Care and Use Committees. Transgenic mice expressing the Polyoma Middle T
(PyMT) oncogene under the control of MMTV LTR were provided by Dr. W.J. Muller
(McMaster University, Ontario, Canada) and bred in house. FVB (Tg(Csf1r-EGFP)1Jwp)
mice have been previously reported to have the whole mononuclear phagocyte system
labeled21. BL6 Ccr2tm1Ifc/J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. FVB
macrophage specific (Csf1r promoter) tamoxifen inducible Cre expressing Tg(Csf1r-MeriCre-Mer)1Jwp) transgenic mouse strain was generated and crossed with VEGFflox/flox mice
(kind gift from Dr. Napoleone Ferrara, Genentech). VEGF knock-out in myeloid cells was
induced by s.c. injection of 3 ug tamoxifen per mouse daily for 2 days before sorting for
blood leukocytes or tumor cell injection.
Metastasis assay
8-week-old FVB females and 6-week-old female nude mice were used for lung experimental
metastasis assays with i.v. injection of 5 × 105 Met-1 cells and 106 MDA-MB-231-derived
LM2 human breast cancer cells, 417322, respectively. If not specified, all animals were
killed 2 weeks after i.v. injection of Met-1 cells or 4 weeks of human tumor cells for optimal

metastatic burden. In experimental metastasis assays, antibodies were given at 10 mg/kg
body weight via i.p. injection 3 hours before tumor cell injection for one time treatments, or
twice a week afterwards in prolonged treatment, if not specified. For paraffin sections, lungs
were injected with 1.2 ml of 10% neutral buffered formalin by tracheal cannulation in order
to fix the inner airspaces and inflate the lung lobes. Lungs were excised and fixed in
formalin overnight. A precise stereological method23 with modification was used for lung
metastasis quantification. Briefly, paraffin-embedded lungs were systematically sectioned
through the entire lung with one 5 um section taken in every 0.5 mm lung thickness. All
sections were stained with H&E and images were taken using a Zeiss SV11 microscope with
a Retiga 1300 digital camera and analyzed using ImageJ24. Mets index equals total Mets
volume normalized to total lung volume and Mets number index equals number of Mets
nodules per mm^2 of lung area. Realtime PCR quantification of human tumor cell burden
were performed as reported using human specific primers25. For spontaneous lung
metastasis, 2.5×106 MDA-MB-231 or 106 LM2 tumor cells were orthotopically injected into
the inguinal mammary gland of SCID beige or nude mice respectively. Anti-mouse CCL2
and CCL1226 and anti-human CCL227 antibodies specifically neutralize only their
respective target molecules and were provided by Centocor Inc., PA, together with the
control antibody. In spontaneous metastasis assays, antibody treatment began on day 3 after
tumor cell intra-mammary gland injection with 20 mg/kg body weight of each antibody and
continued twice a week thereafter. When each group reached a mean primary tumor volume
of ~1000 mm3, the mice were euthanized. Lungs were perfused with India ink and placed in
Fekete’s solution. Lung metastases were counted in a blinded fashion. All in vivo
experiments were at least two independent experiments with 3-10 mice for each group.
Adoptive transfer

Author Manuscript

CD115+F4/80+CD11b+Ly6C/Gr1+ and Ly6C/Gr1− BM monocytes were sorted from FVB
Csf-1r-EGFP and adoptively transferred into FVB mice. 105 of either cells were transferred
into mice bearing mammary tumors and/or pulmonary metastases. Monocytes were sorted
using the same protocol from CCR2 null mutant mice (KO) mice and labeled with
CellTracker™ (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instruction, before adoptive transfer
into nude mice. Fresh human CD14+ peripheral monocytes were purchased from All Cells
LLC. CA. 105 CD14+CD16− and CD14+CD16+ cells were FACS sorted and i.v. transferred
into nude mice supplemented with 2×106 units recombinant human CSF-1 via s.c. injection.
In indicated experiments, specified antibodies were given at 10 mg/kg body weight 3 hours
before monocyte adoptive transfer.
FACS analysis and antibodies

Author Manuscript

For FACS analysis, lungs or whole mice were perfused thoroughly with cold PBS before
harvest, then lungs were minced on ice and digested with enzyme mix of Liberase and
Dispase (Invitrogen, CA). Blood was drawn by cardiac puncture. Red blood cells were
removed using RBC Lysis buffer (eBioscience, CA). Cells were blocked using anti-mouse
CD16/CD32 antibody (eBioscience, CA) for mouse cells or 10% goat serum for human cells
before antibody staining. Antibodies used were: anti-mouse CD45 (30-F11), CD11b
(M1/70), Gr1 (RB6-8C5), CD115 (AFS98), Foxp3 (FJK-16s; eBioscience), CD3

Serotec); anti-human CD14 (Tük4), CD16 (3G8; Invitrogen) and CD45 (HI30; BioLegend),
CCR2 (48607; R&D Systems). FACS analysis was performed on a LSRII cytometer (BD
Biosciences) and data were analyzed using Flowjo software (TreeStar, OR). Single cells
gating using FSC/W and SSC/W and dead cells exclusion with DAPI staining were
performed routinely during analysis. Mouse CCL2 was stained using specific Ab (R-17;
Santa Cruz) following a standard immunohistochemistry protocol.
Cell culture and in vitro extravasation assay

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

All cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. The extravasation assay was performed as previously
described28,29 with modifications. Briefly, 2×104 endothelial cells, 3B-11 (ATCC), were
plated into the upper chamber of GFR Matrigel™ invasion chamber (BD Biosciences) in
DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS. A monolayer was formed in 2 days and verified by
microscopy. 104 bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) or FACS sorted monocytes
were loaded to the basolateral side of the insert and put into plate well with DMEM with
10% FBS and 104 unit/ml Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) to allow attachment. VEGF
knockout BMMs derived from Csf-1r-Mer-iCre-Mer:VEGFflox/flox mouse were induced by
treating the cells with 1 uM 4-hydroxyl-tamoxifen for 7 days after BM isolation. 2×104
CellTracker™ CMRA (Invitrogen) stained Met-1 cells were loaded into the insert with
DMEM in 0.5% (v/v) FBS and 104 unit/ml CSF-1. CCL2 neutralizing antibody and control
antibody were used at 5 ug/ml applied to both sides of the insert. Plates were incubated
under normal tissue culture conditions for 36-48 hours before being fixed with 1% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde. Tumor cell trans-endothelial migration was quantified by counting the
number of cells that migrated through the insert under a fluorescent microscope (6-10
different randomly selected fields in each insert) and expressed as cell number per 20X field
if not specified. Permeability assay was performed by loading 4% (w/v) Evan’s blue labeled
BSA to the upper chamber with pre-formed endothelial monolayer of 3B-11 cells and
measuring absorption of the phenol-red free medium of the lower chamber at 650 nm after
30 minutes incubation in normal culturing conditions. All in vitro experiments were at least
three independent experiments with duplicates or triplicates measures.

Ex vivo whole lung imaging

Author Manuscript

A well-established intact lung microscopy technique31,32 was applied to observe tumor cells,
macrophages, and blood vessels in the mouse lungs. CFP-expressing Met-1 cells prepared
by retro-virus infection of a CMV promoter-CFP vector were injected i.v. into the tail vein
of each mouse. At the time indicated, mice were anesthetized and injected with 10 ug Alexa
Fluor® 647 conjugated anti-mouse CD31 antibody (BioLegend, CA). Five minutes later, the
mouse was put under artificial ventilation through trachea cannulation. The lung was cleared
of blood by gravity perfusion through the pulmonary artery with artificial medium [KrebRinger bicarbonate buffer with 5% dextran and 10mmol/L glucose (pH 7.4)]. The heart–
lung preparation was dissected en bloc and placed in a specially designed plexiglass
chamber with a port to the artificial cannula. The lung rested on a plexiglass window at the
bottom of the chamber with the posterior surface of the lung touching the plexiglass. The
lung was ventilated throughout the experiment with 5% CO2 in medical air and perfused by
gravity perfusion except during imaging. Three to five animals were imaged for each time
point and 10 to 20 unrelated fields were imaged for each animal.

Author Manuscript

Images were collected with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Mannheim,
Germany) with 60X oil immersion optics. Laser lines at 458 nm, 488 nm and 633 nm for
excitation of CFP, GFP and AF647 were provided by an Ar laser and a HeNe laser.
Detection ranges were set to eliminate crosstalk between fluorophores. Three-dimensional
reconstruction was performed using Volocity™ (Improvision Inc., MA).
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Statistical analysis methods employed were standard two-tailed Student’s t test for two data
sets and ANOVA followed by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc tests for multiple data sets using
Prism (GraphPad Inc.), except for human monocyte transfer with antibody treatment where
paired t test was used because of variations among different donors. For spontaneous
metastasis assay of MDA-MB-231 cells, percent differences in numbers of lung metastases
were compared between groups using parametric survival regression methods, with
metastasis counts greater than 100 considered censored at 100. P values below 0.05 (*),
<0.01 (**) and < 0.001 (***) were deemed as significant and highly significant,
respectively.
