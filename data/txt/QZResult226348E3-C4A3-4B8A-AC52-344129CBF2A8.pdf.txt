Abstract
In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma (NB) cells, nascent immature N-glycosylated
110kDa TrkA moves rapidly from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi Network
(GN), where it matures into the 140kDa receptor prior to being transported to the
cell surface, creating GN and cell surface pools of inactive receptor maintained below
the spontaneous activation threshold by a full compliment of inhibitory domains and
endogenous PTPases. In contrast, the oncogenic alternative TrkAIII splice variant is
not expressed at the cell surface but re-localises to intracellular membranes, within
which it exhibits spontaneous ERGIC/COPI-associated activation and oncogenic Akt
signalling. In this study, we characterise the mechanism responsible for TrkAIII
re-localisation. Spontaneous TrkAIII activation, facilitated by D4 IG-like domain
and N-glycosylation site omission, increases spontaneous activation potential by
altering intracellular trafficking, inhibiting cell surface expression and eliminating an
important inhibitory domain. TrkAIII, spontaneously activated within the permissive
ERGIC/COPI compartment, rather than moving in an anterograde direction to the
GN exhibits retrograde transport back to the ER, where it is inactivated. This setsup self-perpetuating TrkAIII re-cycling between the ERGIC and ER, that ensures
continual accumulation above the spontaneous activation threshold of the ERGIC/
COPI compartment. This is reversed by TrkA tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which promote
anterograde transport of inactivated TrkAIII to the GN, resulting in GN-associated
TrkAIII maturation to a 120kDa species that is degraded at the proteasome.

Introduction

ligand binding and preventing spontaneous ligandindependent receptor activation [1, 7-9]. As a consequence
and in contrast to TrkA, TrkAIII is not expressed at the
cell surface but re-localises to intracellular membranes,
within which it exhibits spontaneous ligand-independent
activation, leading to oncogenic signalling through Akt
but not Ras from this alternative location. Signalling from
TrkAIII differs to classical signalling from cell surface
ligand-activated TrkA through Ras/MAPK, suggesting
that the re-localisation of TrkAIII is fundamental for
it’s oncogenic activity [1]. This hypothesis is supported
by recent reports that the oncogenic activity of several
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) oncogenes depends

The developmental and stress-regulated alternative
TrkAIII splice variant of the NGF receptor tropomyosinrelated kinase, TrkA, is expressed by advanced stage
human neuroblastomas (NBs), associates with poor
prognosis and post therapeutic relapse in unfavourable
high TrkA expressing tumours and exhibits oncogenic
activity in NB models [1-6]. TrkAIII oncogenic activity
is caused by exon 6/7 skipping, which results in the
omission of the extracellular D4 IG-like domain and
several N-glycosylation sites, important for optimising
intracellular trafficking, correct cell surface localisation,

upon their re-localisation [10]. Mutation-activated FLT3
and c-KIT oncogenes, important in haematological
malignancies, are retained within the ER, exhibit ERassociated spontaneous activation and oncogenic
signalling through Akt/STAT5/PIM [11-12]. The Trk-T3
oncogene, involved in thyroid cancer, re-localises to ER
exit sites (ERES), exhibits spontaneous activation within
ERES-associated COPII vesicles and induces oncogenic
signalling from this alternative location through Akt
but not Ras, similar to that reported for the TrkAIII
oncoprotein [1, 13].
The re-localisation of FLT3-ITD and c-Kit-ITD to
the ER results from duplication of the internal tandem
juxta-membrane domains, which impairs ER exit and
facilitates spontaneous activation by compromising an
important receptor inhibitory domain [11, 12]. The relocalisation of Trk-T3 to the ERES/COPII compartment
results from TrkA extracellular domain substitution with
a chimeric Trk-fused gene (TFG) sequences that regulate
COPII vesicle formation at ERES, with the elimination
of important TrkA extracellular domain sequences
further facilitating spontaneous activation [13]. Whatever
mechanisms result in RTK oncogene re-localisation, all
induce oncogenic signalling from an alternative substrate
context [1, 10-13].
Interestingly, the mere overexpression of TrkA
in some cell types results in spontaneous intracellular
activation and altered signalling. In human SV40immortalised 293 kidney cells, TrkA overexpression
results in spontaneous activation within the ERGIC,
which causes GN disruption and inhibits further GNassociated TrkA maturation. This augments intracellular
accumulation, facilitates spontaneous activation and
results in altered signalling through Akt but not Ras from
this alternative site, also similar to that reported for the
TrkAIII oncoprotein [1, 14]. This cell-specific effect most
likely reflects slower rates of intracellular TrkA trafficking,
maturation and cell surface translocation, leading to
aberrant accumulation and spontaneous activation within
the ERGIC, perpetuated by GN disruption [14].
In pursuit of novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit
RTK oncogenic activity, therefore, it is not only important
to characterise the mechanisms responsible for oncogenic
RTK activation and the oncogenic signalling pathways
activated but also to identify the specific sites to which
RTK oncogenes re-localise, and the mechanisms that cause
re-localization and facilitate spontaneous activation. In
the present study, we report a novel mechanism to explain
the re-localisation of the TrkAIII oncoprotein in human
NB cells. This mechanism is characterised by activationdependent retrograde TrkAIII recycling from the ERGIC
back to the ER, which reduces anterograde TrkAIII
transport to the GN, impedes further GN-associated
TrkAIII maturation and sets-up self-perpetuating TrkAIII
accumulation above the threshold for spontaneous
activation within the ERGIC/COPI compartment, resulting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in oncogenic Akt signalling from this alternative location.
This mechanism is prevented by TrkA inhibitors, which
promote anterograde trafficking of inactivated TrkAIII
from the ERGIC to the GN, resulting in GN-associated
maturation of TrkAIII to a novel 120kDa species that fails
to reach the cell surface and is degraded at the proteasome.

Results
TrkA localises to two distinct pools of inactive
receptors in SH-SY5Y cells
We have previously reported [3] and confirm here
(Figure 1A) that TrkA trafficking from ER to GN and then
to the cell surface in SH-SY5Y NB cells occurs without
spontaneous activation and results in two distinct steadystate pools of inactive TrkA receptors at the cell surface
and within the GN, the latter overlapping closely with
the GN marker GM130 [3]. Treatment of TrkA SH-SY5Y
cells with the PTPase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate
(Vanadate, 0.1mM for 3 hours) induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of cell surface but not GN-associated
140kDa TrkA, implicating endogenous PTPases in
preventing spontaneous activation of cell surface 140kDa
TrkA but not GN-associated TrkA (Figure 1A, 3 hours
treatment and Figure 1B, 3 and 6 hours treatment).

CEP-701 alters the localisation of intracellular
immature N-glycosylated 100kDa TrkAIII
The N-glycosylation status of 100kDa TrkAIII
was compared to that of 110kDa and 140kDa TrkA
following overnight treatment with the N-glycosylation
inhibitor tunicamycin (5µg/ml) [15]. Tunicamycin
induced expression of 80kDa TrkA and 70kDa TrkAIII
core proteins (Figure 2A), confirming an N-glycosylated
status for 100kDa TrkAIII, 110kDa and 140kDa TrkA
proteins (Figure 2A). Incubation of 100kDa TrkAIII
immunoprecipitates with endoglycosidase H (250U per
reaction) resulted in TrkAIII degradation to 80-85kDa
fragments, confirming an immature N-glycan status for
100kDa TrkAIII (Figure 2B) [16].
The steady state intracellular distribution of
TrkA and TrkAIII was compared in density-gradient
ultracentrifugation purified membrane fraction prepared
under untreated (control) and CEP-701-treated (100nM
for 16 hours) conditions (Figure 3). In TrkA SH-SY5Y
cells, 76.6+6.9% of immature 110kDa TrkA was ERassociated (calnexin positive fractions 5 and 6), 7.2+0.9%
COP-associated (COPI/II positive fractions 3 and 4)
and 16.2+1.5% GN-associated (TG46/GM130 positive
fractions 1 and 2) (Figure 3A I-II), whereas 1.2+0.1% of
mature 140kDa TrkA was ER-associated (fractions 5 and
6), 34.9+2.4% COP-associated (fractions 3 and 4) and

versus 15 minutes P < 0.0001, df = 6); 23.8±1.7% in COPmembranes (fractions 3 and 4) and a significant increase to
46.9± 3.4% in GN membranes (fractions 1 and 2; verses
15 minutes P < 0.0001, df = 6). This was associated with
further increases, at both 45 and 60 minutes, in GNassociated (fractions 1 and 2) 140kDa TrkA levels. At
60 minutes, total TrkA (110kDa plus 140kDa) levels had
reduced to 13.4±1.2% in ER membranes (fractions 5 and
6; versus 15 minutes P < 0.0001, n = 6) and increased to
69±6.4% in GN membranes (Fractions 1 and 2; versus 15
minutes P < 0.0001, n = 6), indicating rapid 110kDa TrkA
movement from ER to GN, in association with 140kDa
TrkA maturation.
The trafficking of labelled TrkAIII differed
considerably to that of immature 110kDa (Figure
4B). At 15 minutes, 61.5±5.2% of immature 100kDa
TrkAIII was ER-associated (fractions 5 and 6), 28±2.4%
COP-associated (fractions 3 and 4) and 10.4±0.9%
GN-associated (fractions 1 and 2). By 30 minutes, ERassociated 100kDa TrkAIII had reduced to 26.9+2.3%
(fractions 5 and 6; P < 0.0001, df = 6), significantly
increased to 53.5±4.6% in COP membranes (fractions
3 and 4; P < 0.0001, df = 6) and to 19.6±1.8% in GN
membranes (fractions 1 and 2; P < 0.0001, df = 6). At 45
minutes, 100kDa TrkAIII was 25.7±2.2% ER-associated
(fractions 5 and 6; versus 15 minutes P < 0.0001, df
= 6), 39.1±3.3% COP-associated (fractions 3 and 4;
significantly increased versus 15 minutes P < 0.0001, n
= 6; significantly reduced compared to 30 minutes P <
0.0001, df = 6), and 35.2±3.1% GN-associated (fractions
1 and 2; versus 30 minutes P < 0.0001, df = 6). By 60
minutes 100kDa TrkAIII was 62±5.3% ER-associated
(fractions 5 and 6; versus 45 minutes P < 0.0001, df =
6), 26±2.2% COP-associated (fractions 3 and 4; versus
45 minutes P < 0.0001, df = 6) and only 12±1% GNassociated (fractions 1 and 2; versus 45 minutes; P <
0.0001, df = 6), indicating the retrograde transport of
TrkAIII back to the ER.
CEP-701 (100nM: 3 hours pre-incubation prior
to metabolic labelling, then throughout the time course)
(Figure 4C), resulted in a pattern of 100kDa TrkAIII
distribution that at 15 minutes was 69.7±6% ER-associated
(fractions 5 and 6), 18±1.5% COP-associated (fractions
3 and 4) and 12.3±0.9% GN-associated (fractions 1 and
2), at 30 minutes was significantly reduced to 18.3±2.3%
ER-associated (fractions 5 and 6; P < 0.0001, df = 6) and
significantly increased to 48.9±5.2% COP-associated
(fractions 3 and 4;P < 0.0001, df = 6) and 32.5±3.5%
GN-associated (fractions 1 and 2; P < 0.0001, df = 6).
Furthermore, a novel 120kDa TrkAIII species was
detected in GN membrane fraction 1. Total TrkAIII
(100kDa plus 120kDa) was, therefore, 15.8±1.6% ERassociated (fractions 5 and 6), 41.9±3.6% COP-associated
(fractions 3 and 4) and 41.3±3.6% GN-associated
(fractions 1 and 2). By 60 minutes, CEP-701 had caused
a significant reduction in ER-associated TrkAIII to

species were detected.
CEP-701 inhibited TrkAIII tyrosine phosphorylation
and significantly increased localization of 100kDa TrkAIII
to 45.6±4.5% in GN membranes (fractions 1 and 2; versus
untreated controls P = 0.019, df = 6) and significantly
reduced TrkAIII in COP-membranes to 25.7±2.6%
(fractions 3 and 4; versus untreated controls P = 0.0065,
df = 6) and in ER-membranes to 28.7±2.9% (fractions
5 and 6 versus untreated controls P = 0.0035, df = 6),
indicating increased transport to the GN (Figure 3D I-II).
CEP-701 also induced the expression of an additional
120kDa TrkAIII species, localized 51±7.6% to COP
negative TGN46/GM130 positive GN membrane fraction
1 and 49±7.4% to TGN46/GM130 positive-COP positive
fraction 2 (Figure 3D I-II). As a consequence, total TrkAIII
(100kDa plus 120kDa) levels were significantly increased
to 34±1.7% (versus untreated controls P < 0.0001, df =
6) in COP negative TGN46/GM130 positive GN fraction
1, to 33.7±5% in TGN46/GM130 positive COP positive
membrane fraction 2 (versus untreated controls P =
0.0013, df = 6) and significantly reduced to 15.6±1.7%
in COP-membranes (fractions 3 and 4; versus untreated
controls P < 0.0001, n = 6) and 16.7±1.8% (fractions 5
and 6; versus untreated controls P < 0.0001, df = 6) in
ER-membranes (Figure 3D I-II). Therefore, CEP-701
promotes TrkAIII transport from ER to GN and induces
GN-associated 120kDa TrkAIII maturation (Figure 3D).

Activated TrkAIII recycles back to the ER
Metabolically labelling was used to further
interrogate TrkA and TrkAIII trafficking over 60
minutes in density gradient ultracentrifugation separated
membranes.
In TrkA SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 4A) at 15 minutes
post-labelling, 79.2±10.8% of immature 110kDa TrkA
was ER-associated (fractions 5 and 6), 26.9±2.3% COPassociated (fractions 3 and 4), 5.9±0.6% GN-associated
(fractions 1 and 2) and low-level 140kDa TrkA was
detected exclusively in GN fractions 1 and 2. Total TrkA
(110kDa plus 140kDa) was, therefore, 58.7±4.6% ERassociated, 23.5±1.8% COP-associated and 17.8±1.5%
GN-associated. By 30 minutes, ER-associated 110kDa
TrkA had reduced to 42.5±3.6% (fractions 5 and 6; P
= 0.0007, n = 6), COP-associated 110kDa TrkA had
increased to 37.3±3.2% (fractions 3 and 4; P = 0.002, df =
6), GN-associated 110kDa TrkA had increased to 20±1.7%
(fractions 1 and 2; P < 0.0001, df = 6) and 140kDa TrkA
was more clearly detected in GN membranes (fractions 1
and 2). Total TrkA (110kDa plus 140kDa) was, therefore,
reduced to 30.9±3.1% in ER membranes (fractions 5
and 6; P = 0.0001, df = 6) and increased to 40.6±4% in
GN membranes (fractions 1 and 2; P = 0.0001, df = 6).
This change continued through 45 minutes and by 60
minutes resulted in a further reduction in ER-associated
immature 110kDa TrkA to 28.8+2% (fractions 5 and 6,

6), associated with a significant increase in GN-associated

TrkAIII to 45.1±4.5% (fractions 1 and 2; versus 30
minutes, P = 0.0045, df = 6). This was associated with
a marked increase in 120kDa TrkAIII expression, which
was distributed 58.7±7% in COP-negative GN membrane

fraction 1 and 41.3±4.9% in COP positive GN membrane
fraction 2. Total TrkAIII levels (100kDa plus 120kDa)
were, therefore, significantly reduced to 22.1±2.9% in ER
membranes (fractions 5 and 6; versus untreated controls at
60 minutes P < 0.0001, df = 6) and to 17.1±2.2% in COP
membranes (fractions 3 and 4; versus 60 minutes untreated
controls; P = 0.0012, df = 6), and significantly increased
to 60.6±7.8% in GN membranes (fractions 1 and 2; versus
60 minutes untreated controls P < 0.0001, df = 6). This
indicates that CEP-701 promotes TrkAIII trafficking from
the ER to GN, resulting in GN-associated 120kDa TrkAIII
maturation.

(GA, 1µM) further reduced TrkAIII staining intensity
but in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (1µM) TrkAIII staining intensity was restored in
association with re-distribution to intercellular junctions
and cellular projections, consistent with potential cell
surface expression (Figure 6C). These data suggest that
TrkA inhibitors and GA promote TrkAIII degradation at
the proteasome.

Spontaneous TrkAIII activation occurs within the
ERGIC/COPI vesicle compartment

MG-132 (1µM for 3 and 6 hours) induced low-level
120kDa TrkAIII expression, suggesting that in TrkAIII
SH-SY5Y cells a proportion of TrkAIII must arrive at
the GN but upon 120kDa maturation is degraded at the
proteasome and, therefore, not readily detected (Figure
7A).
Nocodozol (0.1µM) abrogated 120kDa TrkAIII
maturation induced by CEP-701 in TrkAIII SH-SY5Y
cells and also abrogated 140kDa TrkA maturation in TrkA
SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 7B), confirming that both 120kDa
TrkAIII and 140kDa TrkA maturation is microtubuledependent, which is consistent with COPI vesicle transport
to the GN [22, 23].
GA (1µM for 12 hours) inhibited TrkAIII tyrosine
phosphorylation, did not reduce 100kDa TrkAIII levels
nor induce 120kDa TrkAIII expression (Figure 7C) but did
inhibit 120kDa TrkAIII maturation induced by CEP-701
(Figure 7D). MG-132 not only reversed this GA-inhibitory
effect but also augmented 120kDa TrkAIII expression
above that induced by CEP-701 alone (Figure 7D),
indicating that GA enhances 120kDa TrkAIII degradation
at the proteasome. We also confirm our previous report
[2], that MG-132 reverses GA abrogation of 140kDa
TrkA expression in TrkA SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 7D).
GA did not reduce 100kDa TrkAIII or 110kDa TrkA
levels, indicating that these immature receptor forms are
relatively insensitive to degradation at the proteasome and
are not stabilized by GA-sensitive interaction with Hsp90.
The thiol reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT)
inhibits protein folding, promotes protein retention within
the ER and prevents protein trafficking to the GN [24].
DTT abrogated both CEP-701-induced 120kDa TrkAIII
maturation and constitutive 140kDa TrkA maturation,
without reducing immature receptor levels (Figure 7E,
left panel). This effect was not inhibited by MG-132,
confirming it to be proteasome-independent, consistent
with the necessity for transport to the GN for both 120kDa
TrkAIII and 140kDa TrkA maturation (Figure 7E)

Nocodozol and GA inhibit 120kDa TrkAIII
Maturation

In TrkAIII SH-SY5Y cells, confocal IF confirmed a
close relationship between Y490 phosphorylated TrkAIII
and the ERGIC marker ERGIC-53, when compared to
the cis-GN marker GM130, the trans-GN marker TGN46
and the ER marker calnexin (Figure 5A), confirming our
previous report using non-confocal IF [3].
Brefeldin A (BFA; 5µg/ml for 6 hours) abrogated
TrkAIII tyrosine phosphorylation, assessed by both
indirect IF (Figure 5B) and Western blotting of whole
cell extracts (Figure 5C). BFA caused re-distribution
of GM130 in TrkAIII SH-SY5Y cells, consistent with
disruption of a constitutively intact GN (Figure 5D).
In co-immunoprecipitation assays, tyrosine
phosphorylated TrkAIII pulled down COPI from densitygradient ultracentrifugation purified membrane fraction 3,
whereas non-phosphorylated TrkA did not, confirming a
different relationship between COP-I, non-phosphorylated
TrkA in TrkA SH-SY5Y cells and tyrosine phosphorylated
TrkAIII in TrkAIII SH-SY5Y cells, respectively (Figure
5E).

TrkA inhibitors promote 120kDa TrkAIII
maturation
Different TrkA inhibitors were compared in their
capacity to promote 120kDa TrkAIII maturation. The
TrkA inhibitors CEP-701, K252a, Go6976 and GW441756
[17-21] all abrogated TrkAIII tyrosine phosphorylation
and promoted 120kDa TrkAIII maturation (Figure 6A).
In contrast, the hyper-activation of TrkAIII induced by
sodium orthovanadate did not result in 120kDa TrkAIII

and subsequent oncogenic activity of the TrkAIII
oncoprotein in SH-SY5Y NB cells. Exons 6-7 skipping
that characterises TrkAIII, eliminates the D4 IG-like
domain and several N-glycosylation sites involved
in optimising intracellular trafficking and reducing
spontaneous activation potential, increasing intracellular
accumulation and facilitating spontaneous activation
within the ERGIC/COPI vesicle compartment. This, in
turn, promotes retrograde TrkAIII transport back to the
ER and reduces anterograde transport to the GN, setting
up a self-perpetuating mechanism for intracellular TrkAIII
entrapment, accumulation, spontaneous activation and
oncogenic Akt signalling from this alternative localisation.
TrkA tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogate this mechanism
and promote TrkAIII transport to the GN, resulting in GNassociated TrkAIII maturation to a 120kDa species that is
more readily degraded at the proteasome.
The marked difference in intracellular trafficking,
cell surface expression and spontaneous activation
exhibited by TrkA and TrkAIII in SH-SY5Y cells confirms
the critical role played exons 6 and 7 encoded sequence in
optimising intracellular trafficking from the ER to the GN,
reducing intracellular spontaneous activation potential
and promoting receptor maturation, an essential step in
cell surface expression (this study and [2]). In the case
of TrkA, this results in two predominant inactive steady
state pools, one within the GN and the other at the cell
surface (this study and [1-3]) both maintained inactive by
a full complement of spontaneous activation inhibitory
D4 and D5 IG-like domains, a full N-glycosylated status
that reduces aberrant accumulation within the ERGIC,
N-glycan maturation that further reduces aberrant
intracellular accumulation by promoting translocation
to the cell surface [1-4, 7, 8-10] and, in the case of cell
surface TrkA, endogenous PTPase activity [2]. In contrast
to TrkA, immature N-glycosylated 100kDa TrkAIII
exits the ER but fails to adequately reach the GN. As a
consequence, TrkAIII does not undergo significant GNassociated N-glycan maturation, fails to reach the cell
surface and becomes entrapped between the ER and
ERGIC intracellular membrane compartments, within
which it accumulates and undergoes spontaneous ERGIC/
COPI-associated activation.
Metabolic labelling comparisons indicated that
whilst TrkA and TrkAIII both exit the ER, TrkAIII
recycles back to the ER from the ERGIC, resulting in
entrapment and accumulation, whereas TrkA moves
from the ERGIC to the GN. TrkAIII recycling from the
ERGIC to the ER was prevented by TrkA inhibitors, which
promoted TrkAIII trafficking to the GN, resulting in GNassociated TrkAIII N-glycan maturation. This indicates
that retrograde recycling of TrkAIII back to the ER and
reduced transport to the GN is TrkAIII activity-dependent.
Subsequent TrkAIII entrapment and accumulation within
the pre-GN compartment, combined with omission of
the D4 IGC1 spontaneous activation prevention domain,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

further augment the potential for spontaneous intracellular
activation. This novel activation-regulated re-localisation
mechanism differs to that utilised by mutated FLT and Kit
RTK oncogenes, which fail to satisfy ER quality control
and are retained and activated within the ER [10-12], and
the Trk-T3 oncogene that is retained and activated within
the ERES/COPII compartment as a result of chimeric TFG
sequences involved in COPII vesicle formation [13].
TrkAIII activation within an ERGIC/COPI vesicle
context was confirmed using BFA, an inhibitor of ARF-1dependent COPI vesicle formation [21], which abrogated
ERGIC-associated TrkAIII activation, was supported by
the close relationship exhibited between COP-I positive
membranes and tyrosine phosphorylated TrkAIII and
by co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine phosphorylated
TrkAIII and COP-I from the same membrane fraction.
The fact that BFA inhibited TrkAIII activity but did not
promote TrkAIII 120kDa maturation is explained by its
capacity to disrupt the GN (this study and [21]), which
would prevent the transport of inactivated TrkAIII to
the GN. BFA does not disrupt the ERGIC [25], further
supporting the hypothesis of ERGIC-associated TrkAIII
activation within a COP-I vesicle context but does prevent
COP-II vesicle formation [21]. We do not exclude,
therefore, a potential role for COP-II vesicles in regulating
the spontaneous activation of TrkAIII. BFA inhibition of
spontaneous TrkAIII activation in SH-SY5Y cells differs
to a report that ERGIC-associated spontaneous TrkA
activation in human kidney 293 cells is insensitivity to
BFA and, therefore, COPI-independent [14].
The mechanism through which activated TrkAIII
recycles back to the ER remains to be elucidated. TrkAIII
does not contain KDEL-like sequences, suggesting a
KDEL-R-independent mechanism but could complex
with KDEL-cargos in active-form to facilitate retrograde
transport in KDEL-R/COPI vesicles [26, 27]. KDEL-R is
a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and induces Arf1dependent COPI vesicle formation upon cargo binding
[27]. GPRCs activate immature intracellular TrkA [28-30],
suggesting an intriguing possibility that cargo-activated
KDEL-Rs may activate TrkAIII, resulting in retrograde
transport of KDEL-R/COPI vesicles containing KDELRactivated TrkAIII. Although immature TrkA receptors
were not activated under similar conditions, this may
explain the selective activation of TrkAIII within the
ERGIC/COPI compartment. We are investigating this
possibility.
Alternatively, the recycling of activated TrkAIII
from the ERGIC to ER may result from motor proteindriven, MT minus-end, retrograde receptor transport,
analogous to that described for the retrograde transport of
ligand-activated cell surface TrkA receptors [31-33]. Such
a mechanism would not only explain recycling back to
the ER but also the accumulation of active TrkAIII at the
centrosome [3]. Whatever the mechanism, the net result
is self-perpetuating TrkAIII re-localisation to the ER/
35647

Oncotarget

ERGIC compartment, with the subsequent combination
of entrapment and accumulation of this compromised
receptor augmenting the potential for spontaneous
activation.
TrkAIII
activation
within
ERGIC/COPI
compartment differs to activation of the TrkT3 oncogene,
which occurs within the ERES/COPII compartment
[13]. This can be explained by different re-localisation
mechanisms. TrkT3 is trapped within the ERES/COPII
compartment by chimeric TFG sequences, not present
in TrkAIII, which regulate COPII vesicle formation
[13]. Both mechanism, however, result in spontaneous
activation and oncogenic Akt signalling from their
respective locations, confirming that TrkA oncoproteins,
compromised either by mutation or alternative splicing,
may re-localise to different intracellular membranes but
become activated when they accumulate above the local
threshold for spontaneous activation.
In contrast to TrkAIII, TrkA did not exhibit
spontaneous activation in SH-SY5Y cells, clearly
implicating the extracellular D4 IG-like domain and
associated N-glycosylation sites omitted from TrkAIII,
in preventing spontaneous intracellular TrkA activation.
This most likely depends upon the optimisation of
intracellular TrkA trafficking to the GN, GN-associated
N-glycan maturation and subsequent expression at the
cell surface [7-9]. The optimisation of intracellular TrkA
trafficking to the GN appears to be key in this respect,
as illustrated by the recent report of spontaneous ERGICassociated activation of immature TrkA in human kidney
293 cells [14]. This cell specific effect, characterised by
aberrant TrkA accumulation within the ERGIC above the
spontaneous activation threshold, results in GN disruption,
which promotes the entrapment of immature TrkA within
the ERGIC, illustrating the absolute requirement for
optimised intracellular trafficking to the GN in preventing
spontaneous intracellular activation [14].
TrkAIII did not exhibit spontaneous activation
throughout the ER but could be activated throughout
the ER by the PTPase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate,
implicating ER PTPases in maintaining ER-associated
TrkAIII inactive [2]. This indicates that active TrkAIII
recycling back to the ER would be inactivated within the
ER prior to being re-transport back to the ERGIC in COPII
vesicles, the formation of which would be enhanced by
TrkAIII-induced Akt signalling [1, 26]. Spontaneous
TrkAIII activation within the GN was also minimal.
This may reflect either the low level of TrkAIII in COPnegative GN membranes and/or the RTK inhibitory nature
of the GN, which is exemplified by the steady state GNassociated pool of inactive TrkA, consistent with the GN
function as natural reservoir for receptor tyrosine kinases
during their maturation [34].
TrkA inhibitors promoted TrkAIII transport from
the ER to GN, resulting in GN-associated TrkAIII
maturation to 120kDa, analogous to GN-associated TrkA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

maturation from 110kDa to 140kDa (this study and [1, 3]).
In contrast, hyper-phosphorylation of TrkAIII induced by
sodium orthovanadate did not result in 120kDa TrkAIII
maturation, supporting an inverse relationship between
TrkAIII activation and maturation. This bears similarity
to ERGIC-associated activation of immature 110kDa
TrkA receptors in human kidney 293 cells, which impedes
140kDa TrkA maturation by disrupting the GN [14].
Here, we found no evidence for GN disruption in TrkAIII
SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that impaired maturation
of TrkAIII involves the reduced transport of activated
TrkAIII to the GN, rather than GN disruption.
The proteasome inhibitor MG132 promoted lowlevel expression of 120kDa TrkAIII without influencing
100kDa TrkAIII levels in TrkAIII SH-SY5Y cells.
This indicates that a small proportion of TrkAIII must
constitutively arrive at the GN and mature to 120kDa but is
not detected in the absence of MG132 due to degradation
at the proteasome. Furthermore, MG132 augmented
120kDa TrkAIII levels induced by CEP-701, restored
120kDa TrkAIII expression to CEP-701-treated TrkAIII
SH-SY5Y cells in which 120kDa TrkAIII expression had
been abrogated by the Hsp90 inhibitor GA and, in the
presence of TrkA inhibitors, caused the re-distribution of
TrkAIII to cellular projections and intracellular junctions,
suggesting cell surface expression. Together, these data
indicate that: TrkA inhibitors promote GN-associated
TrkAIII 120kDa maturation; 120kDa TrkAIII is more
sensitive than 100kda TrkAIII to degradation at the
proteasome; 120kda TrkAIII is stabilised by GA sensitive
interaction the Hsp90 adding to our report that TrkAIII
exhibits GA-sensitive interaction with Hsp90 [2], and that
cell surface expression of 120kDa TrkAIII is prevented by
its degradation at the proteasome.
In conclusion, we propose that the novel relocalisation mechanism characterised by spontaneous
ERGIC/COPI-associated activation and subsequent
retrograde recycling back to the ER is responsible for
the entrapment, accumulation, spontaneous activation
and subsequent oncogenic activity of TrkAIII and is
initiated from the alternative location of the ERGIC/
COPI compartment. This highlights the importance
of intracellular TrkAIII re-localisation for oncogenic
activity, identifies the ERGIC/COPI compartment as a
preferential site for spontaneous TrkAIII activation and
provides an explanation for how TrkAIII, compromised
by the omission of the D4 IGC1 spontaneous activationprevention domain, is able to overcome the threshold
for spontaneous activation. The subsequent and altered
oncogenic signalling through PI3K/Akt but not Ras/
MAPK results in increased survival, a pattern of
malignant gene expression, increased genetic instability
and promotion of stem cell-like behaviour rather than
differentiation [1, 3, 4, 6, 35], which together not only
promote tumour progression but may also be involved in
tumour initiation. TrkA tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogate

inactivated TrkAIII to the GN, resulting in GN-associated
