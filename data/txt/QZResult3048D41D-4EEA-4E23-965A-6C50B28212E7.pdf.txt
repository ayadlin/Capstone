We read with great interest the article by Phipps
et al,1 in which they examined the risk factors for different subtypes of postmenopausal breast cancer. They
found that certain reproductive factors have a greater
effect on the risk of certain molecular subtypes of disease compared with others. However, the authors did
not analyze oral contraceptive use as a risk factor. Oral
contraceptive use has been associated with an increased
risk of breast cancer in young women. Narod et al demonstrated that among BRCA1 mutation carriers,
women who first used oral contraceptives before 1975,
who used them before age 30 years, or who used them
for 5 years may have an increased risk of developing
breast cancer.2 Sporadic triple-negative breast cancers
and tumors that are noted in carriers of the BRCA1
mutation share similar features, including estrogen receptor negativity, high nuclear grade, high Ki-67 staining, cytokeratin 5/6 expression, and epidermal growth
factor receptor expression.3 Furthermore, BRCA1 is
rarely mutated in sporadic breast cancers. However, the
pathologic similarities suggest that BRCA1 or associated pathways can become inactivated in triple-negative tumors via other mechanisms, such as gene
promoter methylation.4 We previously reported a positive association between oral contraceptive use and
triple-negative breast cancer. Although we did not take
into consideration the menopausal status of the
patients, the frequency of oral contraceptive use in our
small cohort was found to be higher in patients with
the triple-negative subtype compared with patients
with other subtypes of breast cancer (35.3% vs 12.2%;
P ¼ .02).5 Taken together, we propose that oral contraceptive use may be associated with an increased risk of
developing triple-negative breast cancer. However, to

Oral contraceptive use has previously been suggested
as a risk factor for breast cancer, and there is some evidence that this association may stronger for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative than ER-positive breast cancer.1

Taken together with the findings of Altundag et al.,2
we agree that oral contraceptive use could plausibly be
associated with an increased risk of triple-negative
breast cancer. However, the majority of the literature
indicates that any association between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer risk is likely restricted to
young, premenopausal women.3 Because our study
examining risk factors for triple-negative, HER-2-overexpressing, and luminal breast cancers was restricted to
women aged 55 years,4 we did not expect to observe
any associations with oral contraceptive use. In reexamining our data, we found a higher prevalence of
ever-use of oral contraceptives in our triple-negative
case group (48%) compared with cancer-free controls
(38%); however, these differences were not found to be
statistically significant, and after accounting for differences in age we observed no association between oral
contraceptive use and the risk of triple-negative breast
cancer (odds ratio of 0.9). Based on these data, we cannot rule out an association between oral contraceptive
use and the risk of triple-negative breast cancer, but we
believe that such an association is more likely to be
observed in a younger study population. Given that triple-negative breast tumors tend to be diagnosed at an
earlier age compared with tumors of the more common
luminal subtype, factors associated with an increased
risk of early-onset breast cancer, such as oral contraceptive use, may be hypothesized be more strongly associated with the risk of triple-negative disease. As the
epidemiologic literature regarding this clinically rele-

vant breast cancer subtype continues to develop, it will
be interesting to discover whether risk factors for triplenegative breast cancer differ according to age at diagnosis and menopausal status.
