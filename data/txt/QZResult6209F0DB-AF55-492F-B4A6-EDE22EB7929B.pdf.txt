BACKGROUND. Long-term survivors of testicular cancer (TC) who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A
cross-sectional study was performed to objectively assess cardiovascular risk,
subclinical atherosclerosis, and endothelial function in long-term survivors of TC.

METHODS. Long-term survivors of TC underwent evaluation including determination of body mass index (BMI), Framingham relative risk (RR), brachial artery
flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT),
soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), high sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP), and flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood for levels of

survivors who received chemotherapy were compared with a chemotherapy naive

RESULTS. Twenty-four patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT)
and 15 were chemotherapy-naive (CN). The CBCT cohort demonstrated more
impairment of brachial artery FMD than the CN group (5.6% vs 8.8%; P 5 .05).
The mean sICAM was also found to be higher in the CBCT cohort compared
with the CN group (P 5 .04). No significant differences between the groups were
noted with regard to BMI, Framingham RR, carotid IMT, or hs-CRP. In a subset of
patients, TC survivors who received chemotherapy had a significantly increased
level of CECs compared with CN patients (P 5 .04). No significant difference in
EPC levels was detected.

CONCLUSIONS. Long-term survivors of TC who received chemotherapy demonstrate objective evidence of endothelial injury and dysfunction, a potential mechanism for increased cardiovascular risk. Cancer 2008;112:1949–53.  2008

T

esticular cancer (TC) is the most common malignancy in men
between ages 20 and 40 years, with approximately 8900 cases
diagnosed annually in the U.S.1 The incidence of TC is increasing
for unclear reasons. With the development of highly effective chemotherapy, patients with advanced disease have an excellent chance
for cure. Therefore, the number of long-term TC survivors is
increasing.
Chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens (CBCT) for TC is
associated with vascular toxicity and serious vascular complications
(eg, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, and thromboembolic disease).2–4 Long-term TC survivors treated with CBCT have an
increased risk of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome.5–8 In addition, studies have demonstrated an
increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with chemotherapy-naive (CN) TC survivors.9,10 To our knowledge, the underlying

mechanisms responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk have not been fully elucidated.
In an effort to understand the mechanisms
underlying increased cardiovascular risk related to
CBCT, we performed a cross-sectional study assessing objective cardiovascular risk, subclinical atherosclerosis, and endothelial function between TC
survivors treated with CBCT and a CN cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects were recruited from the adult cancer survivorship clinic at the Abramson Cancer Center of the
University of Pennsylvania. Consecutive eligible TC
survivors were approached to participate in the
study. All subjects were at least aged 18 years and
2 years from the diagnosis of TC and were free
of disease. Patients with poorly controlled hypertension or significant renal disease (baseline serum
creatinine level 2.0 mg/dL) were excluded. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board and informed consent was obtained from each
participant.

Study Procedures
Subjects completed a TC-specific patient questionnaire that provided details regarding patient demographics and medical history. Information concerning
the subject’s medical history was abstracted from
medical records. Subjects underwent clinical evaluation including measurement of height, weight, blood
pressure, and heart rate. The body mass index (weight
in kilograms divided by the square of the height
in meters) was calculated. A relative risk (RR) score
for coronary heart disease (CHD) was determined
for each subject using the Framingham calculation
formula.11
Laboratory Studies
Subjects had blood drawn for triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(sICAM-1), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP) after an overnight fast. Serum testosterone
and leutinizing hormone (LH) were measured. Hypogonadism was defined as a serum testosterone level
<230 ng/dL or LH >12 IU/L.
Noninvasive Assessment of Subclinical Atherosclerosis
and Endothelial Dysfunction
Subjects underwent brachial artery ultrasound to
determine brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and nitroglycerin-induced dilatation
(N10). Patients underwent bilateral carotid artery B-

mode ultrasound to determine maximum carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) using established
procedures.12 Both tests were performed on the
same day in the fasting state at the noninvasive
Vascular Research Laboratory at the University of
Pennsylvania.

Endothelial Progenitor Cell and Circulating Endothelial
Cell Assays
Flow cytometric analysis was conducted per our previously published assay.13 A total of 5 3 106 leukocytes were stained with a 5-color antibody panel that
included FITC-anti-CD31 (PECAM), PE-anti-CD146,
PE-anti-CD133, PerCP-Cy5.5-anti-CD3, PerCP-Cy5.5anti-CD19, PerCP-Cy5.5-anti-CD33, PE-Cy7-anti-CD34,
and APC-anti-VEGF-R2. To confirm cell viability, cells
were assessed by propidium iodide exclusion. A Becton-Dickinson LSRII cytometer (Braintree, Mass) was
utilized whereby the 5 fluorescent markers along
with light scatter allowed only viable low-side scatter
singlets that were CD3-negative, CD19-negative, and
CD33-negative to be analyzed. Fluorescence minus 1
(FMO) samples were used as negative controls. The
cell populations were quantified as a percentage of
live events, those cells that excluded propidium
iodide. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo
analytical software (Treestar, Ashland, Ore).
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software
(version 14.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). After initial descriptive statistics were obtained, single-sample Student t tests were performed to compare the overall
group of TC survivors with expected population
values with regard to the various measures performed. Differences between patients who previously
received CBCT and CN patients were examined using
the Student t test and chi-square analyses with the
Fisher exact test as appropriate. Alpha was set at
0.05, 2-tailed, for all analyses.

RESULTS
Fifty-two subjects were recruited and 39 eligible
patients completed study testing. Thirteen patients
subsequently decided not to complete the testing
and were not included in this analysis. Participants
were compared with nonparticipants in our TC survivorship clinic database (n 5 102) with respect to
available demographic and medical information. Participants were on average 6.1 years older than nonparticipants (P 5 .001) and 2.7 years farther from
diagnosis (P 5 .002). However, participants and nonparticipants did not differ significantly with respect

to ethnicity, marital status, stage of cancer at diagnosis, or exposure to CBCT (all P > .05).
Of the 39 participants, 24 had received CBCT and
15 patients were CN. Patient characteristics are noted
in Table 1. There was no significant difference
between the CBCT and CN groups with respect to
median age (P 5 .23). Similarly, there was no significant difference noted between the CBCT and CN
groups with respect to median time from diagnosis
to study enrollment (7.4 years vs 5.1 years; P 5 .16).

Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Hormone Status
Cardiovascular risk factors are presented in Table 2.
Although neither the mean nor the median levels differed significantly across the groups, a greater proportion of the CBCT group had elevated blood
pressure than the CN group (P 5 .028). Other cardiovascular risk factors were not found to differ significantly between the groups. Only 7 patients in the
CBCT group and 2 CN patients met the criteria for
hypogonadism (P value not significant).
Coronary Heart Disease Risk and Subclinical
Atherosclerosis
Table 3 lists the mean values for the objective measures
of CHD risk and subclinical atherosclerosis. Based on
established Framingham criteria,11 the 10-year CHD RR
was estimated. The CBCT group produced a trend toward greater risk compared with the CN group (P 5 .10).
Both groups had a mean CHD RR that was significantly
higher than 1.0 (P < .03). The mean brachial artery FMD
was 5.63% in the CBCT group and 8.78% in the CN
group, which represents a statistically significant difference (P 5 .05). Both groups had preserved N10 no significant differences noted between groups (P value not
significant). This suggests that the impaired brachial artery FMD is the result of endothelial dysfunction, not
vessel wall smooth muscle dysfunction. We compared

healthy subjects (>12%),14 and found that both groups
were significantly different from expected values (P <

found to be significantly different between the groups.
Measurement of serum sICAM-1 and hs-CRP was
obtained for 31 individuals. The sICAM-1 levels were
found to be significantly higher in the CBCT group compared with the CN group (P 5 .04). However, both groups
demonstrated values within the normal range. The hsCRP levels did not differ significantly between groups.

Endothelial Progenitor and Circulating Endothelial Cells
Flow cytometry analysis of blood for endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (CD1331, vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor [VEGF]-R21) and circulating
endothelial cells (CECs) (CD1461, VEGF-r21,
CD311) was performed in 5 randomly selected subjects in the CBCT group and 5 in the CN group. The
results are shown in Figure 1. Although the mean
levels of EPC did not differ between the 2 groups,
the mean levels of CEC were found to be significantly higher in the CBCT group (P 5 .04).

DISCUSSION
Long-term TC survivors have an increased mortality
rate from non-TC causes.14 Two large studies have
demonstrated that TC survivors treated with CBCT
have an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with CN survivors.9,10 Van den Belt-Dusebout
et al.10 reported that, in a cohort of 2512 5-year survivors of TC, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for
CHD was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI],
1.04–1.31). Chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine,
and bleomycin was associated with a 1.9-fold (95% CI,
1.7–2.0) increased risk of myocardial infarction. The
combination of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin
was found to be associated with a 1.5-fold increased
risk of cardiovascular disease, but no increase in the
risk of MI. Huddart et al.9 reported on cardiovascular
disease in 992 long-term survivors of TC with a median follow-up of 10.2 years. After adjusting for age,
an increased risk of cardiac events was noted after
chemotherapy (RR of 2.59; 95% CI, 1.15–5.84), radiotherapy (RR of 2.40; 95% CI, 1.04–5.45), and chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (RR of 2.78; 85% CI, 1.09–
7.07) compared with surgery alone.
To our knowledge, the mechanisms responsible
for this underlying increased cardiovascular risk have
not been fully elucidated, but long-term TC survivors
treated with chemotherapy are reported to have an

increased risk of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome compared with CN
patients.5–8 In the current study, we noted that a
greater proportion of the CBCT group had blood
pressure elevations compared with the CN group.
However, we did not observe any significant differences with regard to other cardiovascular risk factors
including obesity. In addition, a minority of patients
in both groups demonstrated hypogonadism, which
has been hypothesized as a potential mediator of the
metabolic syndrome.6
In vitro studies have demonstrated that CBCT
can result in endothelial injury.15,16 Levels of cisplatin
remain detectable in the plasma of TC survivors up
to 20 years after the completion of chemotherapy.17
Increased cardiovascular risk could be attributed to
exposure of the endothelial cells to cisplatin for decades, resulting in cumulative endothelial injury. The
results of the current study suggest a central role for
endothelial injury as a result of chemotherapy exposure. Brachial artery FMD is an established technique
with which to identify endothelial injury and increased cardiovascular risk. In the current study, the
CBCT group was found to have significantly impaired
brachial artery FMD compared with the CN group.
The preservation of N10 in both groups suggests that
the CBCT group has impaired endothelial function
but intact vessel wall smooth muscle function. In
addition, the CBCT group demonstrates a significant

CV Risk in TC Survivors/Vaughn et al.

difference in sICAM-1 levels. This also suggests
impaired endothelial function in this group.
More recently, the quantification of circulating
EPCs and CECs has been possible using flow cytometric analysis and other methods.13 EPCs are bone
marrow-derived restorative and regenerative cells
that are recruited to sites of vascular injury. A
decrease in the number of EPCs has been associated
with peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and CHD.18 CECs are mature cells that are
believed to have detached from the intimal monolayer in response to endothelial injury. Increased
numbers of CECs have been demonstrated in cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes.18 In a small
subgroup of patients in the current study, we demonstrated that CEC levels were significantly elevated in
the CBCT group compared with the CN group, a
finding that is consistent with this group having sustained endothelial injury. Levels of EPCs did not differ between the groups.
The current study has limitations. Objective
measures of cardiovascular risk, subclinical atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction were performed in relatively small numbers of TC survivors
recruited from a comprehensive cancer center-based
cancer survivorship program rather than the community at large. In addition, we do not have data
regarding an age-matched, non-TC control group for
comparison. Measures were directly compared
between groups and with accepted risk indices, but
comparison with healthy controls is based on historic data. Given our relatively small sample size, any
conclusions must be viewed as tentative because it is
not possible to control for potential confounds without overfitting our data. These pilot data need to be
confirmed in a larger cohort of TC survivors. This
study is being planned and, in addition to comparing
measures of endothelial dysfunction in TC survivors
treated with chemotherapy versus those who are CN,
will also include a non-TC healthy control group.
These issues notwithstanding, the results of the
current study strongly suggest that long-term TC survivors treated with chemotherapy have objective evidence of endothelial dysfunction compared with CN
patients. The importance of this is 2-fold. First, validated biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction could
potentially identify asymptomatic long-term TC survivors who are at increased cardiovascular risk years
before an actual event occurs. This would provide
the opportunity for interventions aimed at secondary
prevention. Second, a better understanding of the
mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced endothelial
injury could potentially lead to primary prevention
approaches.
