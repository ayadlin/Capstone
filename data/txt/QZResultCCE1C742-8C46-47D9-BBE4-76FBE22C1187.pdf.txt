Human Mu-Opioid Receptor Gene A118G
Polymorphism Predicts the Efficacy of
Tramadol/Acetaminophen Combination
Tablets (Ultracet) in Oxaliplatin-Induced
Painful Neuropathy
Yu-Chang Liu, MD1,2 and Wei-Shu Wang, MD, PhD1,3

BACKGROUND: The A118G polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), resulting in the substitution of an
amino acid, has been found to be associated with functional effects and response to opioid treatment. The purpose
of this study was to assess whether this polymorphism contributes to the variability in response to tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets (Ultracet) for treating oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy. METHODS: A total of
96 patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum (n ¼ 84), or stomach (n ¼ 12) who had developed oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy were enrolled. Ultracet was administered at 1 tablet every 6 hours, and pain was
assessed and scored using a visual analog scale (VAS). The OPRM1 A118G polymorphism was examined with a polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing method. RESULTS: The allelic frequency of variant (118G) allele was 39.6%,
and the prevalence of OPRM1-118 AA, AG, and GG genotypes was 31.3% (n ¼ 30), 58.3% (n ¼ 56), and 10.4% (n ¼ 10),
respectively. For all patients, the mean pre-treatment and post-treatment VAS scores were 3.1 and 2.1, respectively
(P < .001). Patients with AA genotype had a better analgesic effect than those with G allele variants (AG or GG
genotypes). Pre-treatment and post-treatment VAS scores for patients with G allele variants were 3.1 and 2.6, respectively; however, for patients with AA genotype, pre-treatment and post-treatment VAS scores were 3.0 and 0.9,
respectively (P < .001). The requirement for rescue analgesia was also higher for patients with G allele variants (P ¼
.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Ultracet is effective in the management of oxaliplatin-induced painful
neuropathy. A118G polymorphism of OPRM1, by altered function of the mu-opioid receptor and consequential analgesic effect on opioid agents, could be a key determinant for decreased response to Ultracet. Cancer 2012;118:1718-25.

INTRODUCTION

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is common in patients treated with several classes of chemotherapeutic agents including taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and platinum-based compounds. Oxaliplatin, a platinum-based compound, is effective in the treatment of metastatic colorectal and gastric carcinomas; however, chemotherapy-induced
peripheral neuropathy is frequently encountered.1 Oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy includes an acute, transient peripheral
nerve hyperexcitability, which can result in painful neuropathy, and a chronic, dose-related, sensory neuropathy with
symptoms similar to those caused by cisplatin.2 Development of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy results in
severe disturbance of neurologic functions, and can have a significant impact on oxaliplatin treatment.
The treatment of chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy remains largely ineffective. Although different strategies have been attempted, no pharmacological agent has yet been shown to be very helpful.

inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a modest effect in
relieving neuropathy symptoms,3 but it remains unclear
whether inflammation is an important component of
chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy. Tricyclic
antidepressants, including nortriptyline and amitriptyline,4,5 and anticonvulsants, including carbamazepine and
oxcarbazepine,6,7 have been suggested as therapeutic
options for neuropathic pain; however, there are few data
to support their use in chemotherapy-induced painful
neuropathy. Therefore, identification of alternative treatment strategies would be helpful for patients afflicted with
chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy.
Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic that binds
mu-opioid receptors and inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin at synapses. Acetaminophen is a centrally acting analgesic that appears to relieve pain through
both spinal and supraspinal levels. The combination of
tramadol and acetaminophen may relieve pain through
multiple pathways; this combination, in a fixed ratio of
approximately 1:8, has been found to have a synergistic
effect in animal models.8 In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, tramadol/acetaminophen 37.5 mg/325 mg
combination tablets (Ultracet) were effective in relieving
fibromyalgia pain.9 In addition, Ultracet is effective in the
treatment of chronic low back pain,10 osteoarthritis pain
in subjects receiving a COX-2 inhibitor,11 and breakthrough pain in cancer patients.12 However, there remains
a subgroup of patients who do not respond to Ultracet;
therefore, identification of factors predictive of sensitivity
to drugs for relieving pain is of extreme interest.
Genetic polymorphisms involved in the mu-opioid
receptor have been associated with an altered pain threshold and susceptibility to opioid drugs. The most common
coding region single nucleotide polymorphism in the
OPRM1 gene is the A118G (A to G substitution) polymorphism.13 This polymorphism results in the substitution of the amino acid asparagine with aspartate at
position 40, and has been found to be associated with possible functional effects that may affect morphine efficacy.14 For patients with pain caused by malignant
diseases, the A118G polymorphism in OPRM1 significantly increases morphine requirements.15 Individuals
homozygous for the wild-type 118A allele required less intravenous patient-controlled analgesia consumption after
total abdominal hysterectomy.16 For patients undergoing
painful cosmetic surgery, less than optimal or diminished
analgesic effects of fentanyl were shown in individuals
with 118G allele variants.17 The mu-opioid receptor is
also the primary site of action for several endogenous

opioid peptides,18 and altered OPRM1 genotype has been
associated with vulnerability for developing opiate addiction. One study has shown an increased affinity and potency of beta-endorphin on the homozygous G allelic
receptor, resulting in increased vulnerability for developing addiction.19
On the basis of these earlier findings, we propose
that Ultracet may be effective in relieving chemotherapyinduced painful neuropathy, and the A118G polymorphism of OPRM1 may account for altered susceptibility
to Ultracet treatment. A total of 96 patients were enrolled,
and the influence of OPRM1 A118G polymorphism on
Ultracet efficacy was analyzed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
To understand the efficacy of tramadol/acetaminophen
combination tablets (Ultracet) in relieving oxaliplatininduced painful neuropathy and the impact of the
OPRM1 A118G polymorphism on the analgesic effect of
Ultracet, we examined 96 ethnic Chinese patients with
adenocarcinoma of the colon, rectum, or stomach, who
had received an oxaliplatin-based regimen and had experienced mild to moderate neuropathic pain. Among them,
56 patients were diagnosed as having unresectable metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with first-line FOLFOX-4 regimen; another 28 patients with stage II/III
colorectal carcinoma receiving curative surgery were
treated with FOLFOX-4 in the adjuvant setting. The
remaining 12 patients diagnosed as having metastatic gastric cancer were treated with first-line XELOX regimen.
Administration of currently used nonopioid analgesic
drugs was allowed, but the dose and frequency of these
drugs remained unchanged during the Ultracet treatment
period. Patients with cognitive impairment, pre-existing
neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, brain metastasis, or history of major depression or severe anxiety, or
who were currently receiving drugs that may affect the
nervous system were excluded from this study. An institutional review board reviewed the study, and all patients
were provided written, informed consent before initiation
of study-related procedures. Characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in Table 1.

consisting of oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2, day 1) and capecitabine (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (1000 mg/m2 twice daily,
days 1-14) was administered every 3 weeks. Ultracet (Janssen Korea, Kyunggi-Do, South Korea) was administered
orally at 1 tablet every 6 hours. For patients experiencing
undesirable pain control or breakthrough pain, rescue analgesia with 1 tablet of Ultracet was administered every 6
hours according to a previously published article.12 A
detailed neurological history was obtained including possible risk factors for the development of peripheral neuropathy (eg, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, central nervous
system diseases, prior history of neurotoxic drug use, or
neuropathy). Pain severity was assessed and scored using a
visual analog scale (VAS) before and 24 hours after the
administration of Ultracet.
Examination of the OPRM1 A118G and
C17T Polymorphisms
Genomic DNA, extracted from patients’ leukocytes via
0.5 mL whole blood using standard phenol-chloroform
procedures, was subjected to OPRM1 polymorphism testing. The OPRM1 A118G polymorphism was examined
using the method previously described.19 Briefly, DNA
was extracted from patients’ white blood cells using standard phenol-chloroform procedures. Then 0.1 lg genomic
DNA, forward primer 50 -GAT GAG CCT CTG TGA
ACT AC-30 and reverse primer 50 -CAA TCA CAT ACA
TGA CCA GG-30 , were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Initial denaturation was carried
out at 94 C for 5 minutes. Cycling conditions were:
primer annealing at 60 C for 1 minute, polymerization at
72 C for 1 minute, and strand separation at 94 C for 1
minute. Thirty-five cycles were carried out. A final polymerization step of 72 C for 10 minutes was carried out to
complete the elongation processes. A negative (no DNA)
control was run with each PCR analysis. The size of the
PCR product was 523 bp. After amplification, the PCR
products were sequenced directly.
The C17T polymorphism of OPRM1 is the second
most common coding region variant of the human muopioid receptor gene in Caucasian populations.20 In the
current study, OPRM1 C17T polymorphism was also
examined using these PCR products and direct sequencing results. The prevalence of OPRM1 C17T polymorphism was analyzed, and the influence of this
polymorphism on the analgesic efficacy of Ultracet was
evaluated.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software system (SPSS for Windows, version 14.0, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, Ill). The correlations between different
OPRM1-118 genotypes and clinical characteristics,
response, and the requirement for rescue analgesia to
Ultracet treatment were analyzed with chi-square test.
The genotype was dichotomized into the wild-type homozygote (AA) and the combination of the G allele variants
(AG þ GG) as previously described.17 To assess the efficacy of Ultracet for relieving oxaliplatin-induced painful
neuropathy, we used the Wilcoxon signed rank test to
compare the VAS scores obtained before and 24 hours after Ultracet treatment. To assess the value of the A118G
polymorphism of OPRM1 in predicting Ultracet efficacy,
we used a general linear model with repeated measures
that included 118 AA and AG þ GG genotypes. P values
<.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Ultracet Is Effective in Relieving
Oxaliplatin-Induced Painful Neuropathy
A total of 96 patients with adenocarcinoma, including
colorectal (n ¼ 84) and gastric (n ¼ 12) carcinomas, who
developed mild (VAS 1-3) to moderate (VAS 4-6) painful
neuropathy after being treated with oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy were analyzed. No differences were found
in clinical characteristics, including age, sex, body weight,
performance status, location of primary tumor, presence
of distant metastasis, and cycles of oxaliplatin treatment in
patients with or without OPRM1 A118G polymorphism
(Table 1). Ultracet was administered orally at 1 tablet every
6 hours. As shown in Figure 1, the mean pre-treatment
and post-treatment VAS scores were 3.1 and 2.1, respectively (P < .001), indicating that Ultracet is effective in the
management of oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy.

A118G Polymorphism Has Been Identified in

Because A118G polymorphism of OPRM1 is associated
with functional change of the mu-opioid receptor and
reduced analgesic efficacy to opioid agents,15-17 we wondered whether this polymorphism also contributes to
altered efficacy of oral Ultracet treatment. Representative
PCR-direct sequencing patterns of different OPRM1-118
genotypes are shown in Figure 2. The allelic frequency of

the variant (118G) allele was 39.6%. The prevalence of
OPRM1 codon 118 AA, AG, and GG genotypes was
31.3% (n ¼ 30), 58.3% (n ¼ 56), and 10.4% (n ¼ 10),
respectively, which is similar to a previous study in Singapore.21 Compared with Caucasian populations, a significantly higher prevalence of 118G allele variants was
demonstrated in our cases (68.7% vs 21.1%).19 In contrast, the C17T polymorphism of OPRM1, the second
most common coding region variant of the human muopioid receptor gene in Caucasian populations, has not
been found in the patients enrolled in this study, indicating
the existence of ethnic differences in OPRM1 genotypes.
OPRM1 A118G Polymorphism Leads to a
Reduced Analgesic Efficacy for Ultracet
Compared with the AA genotype (wild-type), patients
with 118G allele variants (AG or GG genotypes) in
OPRM1 had a significantly reduced response to Ultracet
treatment, which is consistent with previous findings.15-17
As shown in Figure 3, the pre-treatment and post-treatment VAS scores for patients with G allele variants were
3.1 and 2.6, respectively; however, for patients with AA
genotype, pre-treatment and post-treatment VAS scores
were 3.0 and 0.9, respectively (P < .001). In addition,
patients with G allele variants had a higher percentage of
moderate pain (VAS 4-6) after being treated with Ultracet
(0 vs 15.2%; P ¼ .02) (Table 1). We subsequently

proposed that this polymorphism, by functional effects
that may affect the efficacy of opioids, might account for a
higher incidence of breakthrough pain and a higher need
for pro re nata analgesics. As shown in Table 1, the
requirement for rescue analgesia was also significantly
higher for patients with G allele variants (3.3% vs 24.2%;
P ¼ .01), indicating that the OPRM1 A118G polymorphism may affect individual sensitivity to Ultracet treatment. In the current study, only a minority of patients
received concurrent NSAIDs (diclofenac, celecoxib, or
ibuprofen), and the percentage of patients receiving these
drugs was very similar in both OPRM1 genotype groups
(13.3% vs 16.7 %; P ¼ .68) (Table 1); therefore, the
influence of concurrent NSAID treatment in patients
with different OPRM1 genotypes could be neglected.

DISCUSSION
Opioids have long been misguidedly considered ineffective for the treatment of neuropathic pain22; however, in
properly selected patients, opioids may be a good option

patients with homozygous AA genotype, the pre-treatment
and post-treatment VAS sores were 3.0 and 0.9, respectively
(P < .001; general linear model with repeated measures), indicating that the OPRM1 A118G polymorphism may affect individual sensitivity to Ultracet treatment.

for treating painful neuropathy. For example, the benefit
of oxycodone in treating diabetic neuropathy has been
demonstrated,23 and the use of tramadol may effectively
relieve pain and allodynia in patients with polyneuropathy.24 In the current study, we demonstrated that Ultracet, a tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablet, is
effective in relieving oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy. The mean pre-treatment and post-treatment VAS
scores are 3.1 and 2.1, respectively (P < .001, Fig. 1),
indicating that Ultracet plays a role in the management of
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
Pain is an early manifestation of several forms of neuropathies, including those induced by chemotherapy. In
contrast to chronic cumulative neuropathy induced by cisplatin, oxaliplatin induces symptoms with cold allodynia
and a rapid onset hyperexcitability early in the course of
treatment.25 Oxalate, a metabolite of oxaliplatin, has been
suggested to be toxic to sodium channels, therefore; chelation of oxalate with calcium and magnesium may prevent
acute toxic neuropathy.26 Interestingly, oxaliplatin-induced
mechanical hyperalgesia can be antagonized by antioxidants, supporting a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production in oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy.27
Clinically, the use of glutathione protects against chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy by defending

against oxidative injury.28 In addition, glutathione S-transferase P1 contributes to the detoxification of cytotoxic compounds, including ROS, which may alter the efficacy and
cumulative neurotoxicity of chemotherapy.29
In the current study, patients with OPRM1-118 G
allele variants had a reduced analgesic effect in response to
Ultracet, which is compatible with previous studies.15-17
The pre-treatment and post-treatment VAS scores for
individuals with G allele variants were 3.1 and 2.6, respectively; but for patients with the AA genotype, they were
3.0 and 0.9, respectively (P < .001, Fig. 3). In addition,
the requirement for rescue analgesia was also higher for
patients with G allele variants (3.3% vs 24.2%, P ¼ .01)
(Table 1). Clinically, individuals have different sensitivity
to opioid drugs, suggesting potential variability in opioid
receptors or their downstream effectors. Opioid receptors
are the primary sites of action of opioid analgesics, which
mediate multiple pharmacologic effects. Among subpopulations of opioid receptors, the mu receptor modulates
predominately supraspinal analgesia,30 and polymorphisms of the mu-opioid receptor gene may contribute to
altered susceptibility to opioid drugs. For example, the
A118G polymorphism of OPRM1 increases opioid
requirements in patients with pain caused by various etiologies.15-17 In addition, the short tandem repeats in the 50
flanking and 30 untranslated regions of OPRM1 have been
associated with altered sensitivity to morphine-induced
antinociception.31 However, the C17T polymorphism of
OPRM1, the second most common coding region variant
of the mu-opioid receptor gene in Caucasian populations,
has no influence in ligand binding or ligand-mediated
signaling.32
In the current study, patients with different OPRM1
genotypes were treated with similar cycles of oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy, and very similar pre-treatment VAS
scores were found (3.0 and 3.1, respectively). Genetic
polymorphisms of the mu-opioid receptor gene can also
contribute to altered pain perception. For example,
genetic variation at codon 118 of OPRM1 has been associated with interindividual differences in pain scores of
patients receiving cesarean section, and the pain scores
were lowest in the AA group and highest in the GG
group.21 In another study, the A118G polymorphism of
OPRM1 was associated with increased sensitivity to pressure pain.33 An enhanced binding affinity and potency of
beta-endorphin to the GG variant of the mu-opioid receptor has been demonstrated,19 but the potential effect
of repeated, enhanced binding of beta-endorphin to the
GG variant on receptor desensitization needs to be deter-

mined. In addition to physiologic changes, the contribution of OPRM1 polymorphism to behavioral and
personality differences has also been suggested.34 The importance of these factors in determining pain perception
and the effect of opioid analgesics in chemotherapyinduced painful neuropathy need further investigation.
The relationship between opioid-induced nausea
and OPRM1 genotypes remains controversial. Individuals
with the homozygous AA genotype of OPRM1 have a
higher risk of developing nausea after being treated with
morphine, despite a lower consumption of morphine,
suggesting that a greater analgesic sensitivity accorded by
the A allele is related to a higher risk of developing nausea.21 However, another study did not show an increased
occurrence of nausea in individuals with the AA genotype.16 In the current study, the incidence of Ultracetrelated nausea was quite low, and patients with different
OPRM1-118 genotypes had a similar risk of developing
nausea (3.3% vs 4.5%, P ¼ .78), although patients with
G allele variants had higher Ultracet consumption for rescue analgesia (Table 1). The results of the study show that
the total amount of Ultracet used is unlikely to be a dominant factor in inducing nausea, because the genotypic
group that used a higher amount of Ultracet was not associated with a higher risk of developing nausea.
The frequency of OPRM1 A118G polymorphism
varies widely across population groups. Compared with
Caucasian populations,19 a remarkably higher prevalence
(68.7%) of OPRM1 118G allele variants, including A/G
(58.3%) and G/G (10.4%), was noted in the patients in
this study. Ethnic differences have a profound influence
on the response and toxicity of chemotherapy. For example, because of a higher prevalence of EGFR mutations,
gefitinib is very effective in Asian patients with nonsmall
cell lung cancer.35 The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is
rare in Asian populations, leading to a decreased risk of
developing severe neutropenia after treatment with irinotecan.36 In the current study, the prevalence of OPRM1
codon 118 G allele variants was 68.7%, which is similar
to a previous study in Singapore.21 But in Caucasian populations, the prevalence of 118 G allele variants was only
21.1%.19 In addition, the C17T polymorphism of
OPRM1, the second most common coding region variant
of OPRM1 in Caucasian populations, has not been found
in the patients enrolled in this study, which was consistent
with a previous finding.20 These results suggest that Asian
populations might have an altered function in the muopioid receptor and a reduced response to opioid drugs.
However, no randomized study has been conducted to

1723

compare the efficacy of opioid treatment in different ethnic populations.
Varied CYP2D6 activity might also affect the analgesic efficacy of Ultracet. Tramadol owes its pharmacological activity through biotransformation into an active
metabolite, O-demethyltramadol (M1), via cytochrome
P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) in the liver.37 M1 has remarkably
higher activity than tramadol; moreover, M1 is also a
potent monoamine reuptake inhibitor that may enhance
the analgesic effects of tramadol through the inhibition of
neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin.38
Interestingly, different CYP2D6 genotypes result in varied CYP2D6 activity, from very low (poor metabolizer) to
extensively high (ultrarapid metabolizer),39 and the activity of CYP2D6 significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of tramadol and M1; it is anticipated that CYP2D6
genotype may contribute to individual variability of
Ultracet efficacy.
In addition to Ultracet, methadone is also effective
in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy. Methadone, a potent mu-opioid agonist, has
several unique properties that make it the opioid of choice
for the treatment of persistent neuropathic pain.40 The
properties of methadone that set it apart from other
opioids include antagonism to receptors for N-methyl-Daspartate, a known modulator of neuropathic pain.41
Moreover, methadone may inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, leading to improved analgesia in
neuropathic pain.42 In an animal model, methadone produced an analgesic effect on peripheral neuropathy
induced by paclitaxel.43 Clinically, methadone appears to
be useful in the management of intractable neuropathic
noncancer pain.44 In some cases, opioid rotation is
required for avoiding intolerable side effects or achieving
better pain control. Clinical trials have demonstrated successful rotation to methadone from other strong opioids
in the setting of intolerable side effects and inadequate analgesia despite dose escalation.45,46 Outpatient methadone initiation and rotation have been shown to be
effective and safe, with low side effect profiles for cancer
pain treatment.46 On the basis of these findings, the use of
methadone with opioid rotation appears to be a good
option for managing intractable neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Further studies are warranted.
In summary, we demonstrated that Ultracet is effective in the management of oxaliplatin-induced painful
neuropathy. Asian populations have a higher prevalence
of A118G polymorphism in the OPRM1 gene. A118G

1724

polymorphism of OPRM1, by altered function of the muopioid receptor and consequential analgesic efficacy of
opioid agents, could be a key determinant for decreased
response to Ultracet in patients with oxaliplatin-induced
painful neuropathy.
