ABSTRACT
Anti-VEGF-A therapy has proven to be effective for many neovascular diseases.
However, drug resistance to anti-VEGF-A treatment can develop. Also, not all patients
with neovascular diseases are responsive to anti-VEGF-A treatment. The mechanisms
underlying these important issues remain unclear. In this study, using different model
systems, we found that inhibition of VEGF-A directly upregulated PDGF-CC and its
receptors in multiple cell types in pathological angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.
Importantly, we further revealed that combinatorial targeting of VEGF-A and PDGF-CC
suppressed pathological angiogenesis more efficiently than monotherapy. Given the
potent angiogenic activity of PDGF-CC, our findings suggest that the development of
resistance to anti-VEGF-A treatment may be caused by the compensatory upregulation
of PDGF-CC, and combined inhibition of VEGF-A and PDGF-CC may have therapeutic
advantages in treating neovascular diseases.

PDGF-CC is a relatively new member of the PDGF
family. It was identified almost twenty years after the
discovery of PDGF-A and PDGF-B [7, 8]. PDGF-CC
is abundantly expressed by different types of cells, such
as tumor cells [9, 10], endothelial cells (ECs) [11, 12],
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) [12, 13], pericytes,
fibroblasts [12, 14], and macrophages [15]. PDGF-CC
binds to PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β [12], which are also
expressed by many different cell types, including tumor
cells [16, 17], VSMCs, pericytes, and fibroblasts [18], all
of which play important roles in angiogenesis. We and

INTRODUCTION
Anti-VEGF-A therapy has proven to be effective
for the treatment of many neovascular diseases, such
as cancer [1]. However, despite the great success,
outstanding questions exist. For example, drug resistance
to anti-VEGF-A therapy can develop after some time of
treatment [2-4]. Moreover, not all patients with cancer or
other neovascular diseases are responsive to anti-VEGF-A
treatment [5, 6]. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms
underlying these urgent issues remain unclear.

others have shown that PDGF-CC is a potent angiogenic
factor [14, 19-23]. Noteworthy, the angiogenic pathways
induced by PDGF-CC appear to be largely VEGF-Aindependent [24]. For example, Crawford et al [14]
reported that tumor-associated fibroblasts that are deficient
of VEGF-A but with abundant PDGF-CC expression can
promote tumor angiogenesis efficiently [14]. However, it
remains thus far unknown whether PDGF-CC expression
is affected by anti-VEGF-A treatment and whether PDGFCC is related to the acquired drug resistance to antiVEGF-A treatment.
In this study, we investigated the expression status
of PDGF-CC and its receptors after inhibition of VEGF-A
using both cultured cells and a mouse model. We found
that inhibition of VEGF-A increased the expressions of
PDGF-CC and its receptors. Importantly, we further
revealed that combined inhibition of VEGF-A together
with PDGF-CC inhibited pathological angiogenesis more
efficiently than monotherapy. Given the potent angiogenic
nature of PDGF-CC, our data suggest that the upregulation
of PDGF-CC induced by inhibition of VEGF-A may
be responsible for the development of acquired drug
resistance to anti-VEGF-A therapy, and combinatorial
targeting of VEGF-A and PDGF-CC may have therapeutic
advantages over monotherapy in treating neovascular
diseases.

found more Iba1 staining in the CNVs of C57BL/6 but not
129 mice (supplementary Figure 1A, P < 0.05, n = 8 eyes
each group), while no significant difference was found in
SMA staining (supplementary Figure 1B, n = 8 eyes each
group), indicating that the upregulation of PDGF-CC in
C57BL/6 mice was likely mainly due to the Iba1+ cells.

PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β are upregulated
at different time points during choroidal
neovascularization
PDGF-CC binds to PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β[19,
28]. However, it is unclear whether and when the
expressions of PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β were changed in
choroidal neovascularization. We therefore investigated
these using C57BL/6 mice. Western blots showed that
the expression levels of PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β were
upregulated at seven and fourteen days after laser-induced
CNV in both the retinae (Figure 2A, 2B, n=8, P < 0.05,
0.01 or 0.001) and choroids (Figure 2C, 2D, n=8, P < 0.05,
0.01 or 0.001), after the upregulation of PDGF-CC three
days after laser treatment (Figure 2A-2D).

VEGF-A neutralizing antibody upregulates
PDGF-CC and its receptors in CNV
Anti-VEGF-A therapy has been widely used to
treat patients with cancer or other neovascular diseases.
However, after a certain period of anti-VEGF-A treatment,
many patients develop drug resistance. The mechanism
for this acquired drug resistance remains unclear. To
this end, we investigated whether inhibition of VEGF-A
affected the expressions of PDGF-CC and its receptors
in pathological angiogenesis using a mouse CNV model.
Real-time PCR showed that intravitreal injection of
VEGF-A neutralizing antibody (VEGF nab) increased the
RNA levels of PDGF-C, PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β in the
retinae four days after VEGF nab injection in C57BL/6
mice (Figure 3A, n=8, P < 0.05 or 0.001). This was also
true for the choroids (Figure 3B, n=8, P < 0.05). Indeed,
Western blot confirmed higher PDGF-CC protein levels
in the retinae (Figure 3C, n=8, P < 0.01) and choroids
(Figure 3D, n=8, P < 0.01) after intravitreal injection of
VEGF-A nab. Thus, inhibition of VEGF-A by neutralizing
antibody upregulated the expressions of PDGF-CC and its
receptors in pathological angiogenesis in CNV.

RESULTS
PDGF-CC is upregulated in specific mouse
strains in pathological angiogenesis during
choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
We and others have shown that PDGF-CC is a potent
angiogenic and survival factor [20, 22, 24-27]. However, it
is unclear whether and how the expressions of PDGF-CC
and its receptors are changed in pathological angiogenesis,
such as in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in different
mouse strains. To address this, we utilized a laser-induced
CNV mouse model and analyzed the protein levels of
PDGF-CC using four mouse strains, including C57BL/6,
C3H, 129 and DBA mice. We found that three days after
laser treatment (the onset of CNV), PDGF-CC protein
levels were upregulated in both the retinae (Figure 1A,
1B, n = 8, P < 0.01) and choroids (Figure 1C, 1D, n =
8, P < 0.01) in C57BL/6 and C3H mice. However, no
significant change in PDGF-CC level was observed in
129 or DBA mice (Figure 1A-1D, n = 8, P > 0.05). To
investigate the reason why the upregulation of PDGF-CC
in the CNV model only took place in C57BL/6 but not in
129 mice, and since fibroblasts and macrophages are rich
sources of PDGF-CC [14, 15], we investigated whether
there could be a differential recruitment of these cells in
different mouse strains. At day three after laser treatment,
immunofluoresence staining using SMA and Iba1 as
markers for fibroblasts and macrophages respectively, we

We next investigated the cell types that are

angiogenesis. Real-time PCR showed that inhibition of
VEGF-A by neutralizing antibody (VEGF nab) increased
the RNA level of PDGF-C in mouse macrophage
RAW264.7 cells, human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE19 cells and human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) at
different time points (Figure 4A, n=3, P < 0.05, 0.01 or
0.001). Indeed, Western blot confirmed the higher levels
of PDGF-CC protein in the cell lysates (Figure 4B) and
serum-free conditioned medium (Figure 4C), since PDGFCC is a secreted protein [33]. Our results thus demonstrate
that multiple cell types are responsible for the upregulation
of PDGF-CC after inhibition of VEGF-A.

(Figure 5A-5D). We found that knockdown of VEGFR-2
and NP1 did not abrogate the upregulation of PDGFCC by inhibition of VEGF-A with neutralizing antibody
as shown by Western blots using both cell lysates and
serum-free medium (Figure 5A-5D), suggesting that the
upregulation of PDGF-CC by inhibition of VEGF-A is
VEGFR-2 and NP-1 independent.

VEGF-A knockdown by siRNA/shRNA
upregulates PDGF-CC and PDGFRs in vitro and
in vivo
We subsequently engaged yet another approach to
verify our findings by utilizing siRNA/shRNA to further
investigate whether loss of VEGF-A could upregulate
PDGF-CC. First, in cultured Raw264.7 macrophage
and ARPE-19 cells, VEGF-A knockdown by siRNA
reduced the expression of VEGF-A to about 30-40% of
normal level (Figure 6A, upper panel). Loss a VEGF-A
subsequently increased PDGF-CC protein levels in both
the cell lysates (Figure 6A, middle panel) and in the
conditioned serum-free medium (Figure 6B, upper panel).

Upregulation of PDGF-CC by inhibition of
VEGF-A is VEGFR-2 and NP-1 independent
We next analyzed the expression levels of the
receptors for VEGF-A, VEGFR-2 and NP1, in the cell
lines and tested whether the knockdown of them affected
PDGF-CC upregulation. Western blots showed that
VEGFR-2 and NP1 were expressed in ARPE-19 and
HREC cells and were successfully deleted by siRNA

Apart from cultured cells, in vivo assays using mouse
retinae also showed VEGF-A knockdown by shRNA in
mouse retina decreased the expression level of VEGF-A
(Figure 6C, upper panel) with concomitant upregulation
of PDGF-CC, PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β (Figure 6C).
Consistently, real-time PCR also revealed increased RNA
levels of PDGF-C, PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β in the retinae
after VEGF-A knockdown (Figure 6D, n=6, P < 0.01 or
0.001). Thus, loss of VEGF-A upregulated the expressions
of PDGF-CC, PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β both in vitro and
in vivo.

CC in CNV. Western blots showed that three days after
laser induced-CNV and VEGF-A knockdown by shRNA,
VEGF-A protein levels decreased in the retinae of 129
mice with a concomitant increase of PDGF-CC protein
levels (Figure 7, n=6, P < 0.01). Thus, even though there
was no initial upregulation of PDGF-CC in 129 mice
during CNV, loss of VEGF-A also upregulated PDGF-CC.

VEGF-A inhibition upregulates PDGF-CC in
129 mice with CNV

Since inhibition of VEGF-A upregulated PDGFCC expression, and PDGF-CC was a potent angiogenic
factor [19, 20, 22], we hypothesized that blocking
PDGF-CC and VEGF-A simultaneously might be able
to suppress pathological angiogenesis more efficiently
than monotherapy alone. We tested this hypothesis

Combinatorial targeting of VEGF-A and PDGFCC suppresses pathological angiogenesis more
efficiently

We further investigated whether the upregulation
of PDGF-CC after VEGF-A inhibition also took place in
129 mice, in which there was no initial increase of PDGF-

using a laser-induced mouse CNV model and found that
when VEGF-A or PDGF-CC neutralizing antibody was
administered alone at a very low dose (0.7 μg/eye), neither
inhibited CNV (Figure 8A, 8B, n=8, P > 0.05). However,
when the same low dose of PDGF-CC and VEGF-A
neutralizing antibodies were administered together, CNV
formation was significantly inhibited (Figure 8A, 8B,
n=8, P < 0.05), demonstrating that combined inhibition of

PDGF-CC and VEGF-A may have therapeutic advantages
in inhibiting pathological angiogenesis.

DISCUSSION
Anti-VEGF-A therapy has achieved great success
in treating cancer and other neovascular diseases.
However, outstanding questions exist. For example, drug

resistance or tachyphylaxis can develop in many patients
after a certain time of treatment [2-4, 34]. Also, some
patients with neovascular diseases are not responsive to
anti-VEGF-A therapy [5, 6]. Importantly, the molecular
mechanisms underlying these important issues remain
unclear. In this study, we investigated the expressions of
PDGF-CC and its receptors after inhibition of VEGF-A
using different model systems. We found that both in vitro
and in vivo, inhibition of VEGF-A by different approaches
upregulated the expressions of PDGF-CC and its receptors.
Moreover, and importantly, combined inhibition of PDGFCC and VEGF-A simultaneously suppressed pathological

angiogenesis more efficiently than monotherapy. Given the
potent angiogenic nature of PDGF-CC, its compensatory
upregulation following inhibition of VEGF-A may be at
least one of the mechanisms for the development of drug
resistance to anti-VEGF-A therapy.
PDGF-CC is abundantly expressed by different
types of cells, including tumor cells [9, 10], vascular
ECs [11-13], vascular SMCs [12, 13, 35-37], pericytes,
fibroblasts [12, 14] and macrophages [15], all of which
play important roles in pathological angiogenesis. VEGF-A
blockages have been routinely used in the clinic to treat
cancer and other neovascular diseases. However, it remains

unknown whether inhibition of VEGF-A affects PDGFCC expression. In this study, we reveal for the first time
that inhibition of VEGF-A upregulates PDGF-CC and its
receptors in multiple cell types in vitro and in pathological
angiogenesis in vivo. Our finding demonstrates that
pathological angiogenesis involves complex pathways,
and inhibition of VEGF-A can activate compensatory
or alternative angiogenic pathways. Thus, for better
anti-angionenic effect, it may be critical to inhibit such
compensatory pathways together with VEGF-A.
Independent groups have shown that PDGFCC is a potent angiogenic factor [14, 19, 20, 22, 38].
Noteworthy, PDGF-CC-induced angiogenesis appears
to be largely VEGF-A-independent. For example, under
conditions of VEGF-A deficiency, fibroblasts expressing
PDGF-CC still induced robust tumor angiogenesis
[14]. Indeed, unlike VEGF-A, which targets mainly
endothelial cells, PDGF-CC regulates the functions
of a broad spectrum of cell types, such as tumor cells,
vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, RPE cells,
fibroblasts [22], and endothelial cells [20]. Indeed,
consistently, we found in this study that combined
inhibition of PDGF-CC together with VEGF-A
renders a better outcome in suppressing pathological
angiogenesis than inhibition of VEGF-A or PDGF-CC
alone respectively.

Interestingly, we found in this study that the
upregulation of PDGF-CC during pathological
angiogenesis is strain-specific in mice. Among four
different mouse strains (C57BL/6, C3H, 129 and DBA),
the upregulation of PDGF-CC in CNV was only observed
in C57BL/6 and C3H mice, but not in 129 or DBA strains.
This demonstrates that genetic background plays an
important role in regulating the expression of PDGF-CC.
Even though further studies are needed to test whether this
is also true in humans, it may provide an explanation why
a subpopulation of patients with pathological angiogenesis
are not responsive to anti-VEGF-A therapy. Noteworthy,
despite of the lack of initial upregulation of PDGF-CC
in CNV, inhibition of VEGF-A also increased PDGF-CC
expression in these mice, suggestion that the inhibitionof-VEGF-A-induced upregulation of PDGF-CC may be a
general event in pathological angiogenesis.
In summary, in this study, we reveal that inhibition
of VEGF-A directly upregulates the expressions of
PDGF-CC and its receptors in pathological angiogenesis.
Moreover, we report that blocking VEGF-A and PDGFCC simultaneously is more efficient in suppressing
pathological angiogenesis than targeting only one of them
respectively. Our finding advocate combined inhibition of
VEGF-A and PDGF-CC as a therapeutic strategy to treat
patients with neovascular diseases.

Figure 7: VEGF-A inhibition upregulates PDGF-CC in 129 mice with CNV. Western blots show that in 129 mice, three days
after laser induced-CNV and VEGF-A knockdown by shRNA, VEGF-A protein levels decreased in the retinae with a concomitant increase
of PDGF-CC protein levels. Thus, even though there was no initial upregulation of PDGF-CC in the retinae of 129 mice in CNV, loss of
VEGF-A also upregulated PDGF-CC.

four laser spots were made (75μm spot size, 75 ms, 90
mW power; OcuLight Infrared Laser System 810 nm,
Iridex) in the area surrounding the optic disk in the eye.
The eyes were harvested at 3, 7 and 14 days after laserinduced CNV for gene expression analysis.
For shRNA delivery into mouse eyes, the in vivojetPEI (Polyplus Transfection) transfection reagent was
mixed with VEGF-A or scrambled shRNA according to
the manufacturer’s instructions [22]. Intravitreal injection
of mouse VEGF-A shRNA (TRCN0000066822, 1 μg/
eye, Open Biosystems) was performed together with the
in vivo-jetPEI reagent. Age- and gender-matched control
mice received intravitreal injection of scrambled shRNA
(RHS6848, 1 μg/eye, Open Biosystems). The eyes were
harvested for analysis at 3, 4 or 7 days after injection.
For simultaneous inhibition of VEGF-A and
PDGF-CC, neutralizing antibody against mouse VEGF-A

doses were injected intravitreally into mouse eyes. The
first intravitreal injection was performed one day before
laser treatment, and the second one three days after laser
treatment.
For the measurement of CNV lesion areas, 7
days after laser treatment, the mice were euthanized
and eyes harvested for immunostaining and imaging of
the whole-mount choroids. The eyes were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 2 hours. The cornea, crystalline lens
and vitreous were removed and the retinae separated. The
remaining eyecups were rinsed in PBS and incubated in
isolectin GS-IB4 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500,
Life Technologies, I21411) with 1% BSA overnight at
4°C. The eye cups were then washed with ice-cold PBS

Cell culture
The cells used in this study were obtained directly
from cell banks and passaged in our laboratory for fewer
than 6 months. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs)
were purchased from Angio-Proteomie (Boston, MA,
USA) and were characterized by the cell bank using Factor
VIII staining, PECAM1 staining and uptake of Di-I-AcLDL. HRECs were cultured in endothelial cell media
(ECM, ScienCell) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptromycin with endothelial
cell growth supplements (ECGS, ScienCell).
Human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line
ARPE-19 was purchased from (ATCC, Manassas, VA,
USA) and were authenticated by PCR using an STR
Multi-amplification Kit (PowerPlexTM 16 HS System).
The PCR products were analysed using a 3100 DNA
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems®). Results showed that
no loci has tri-alleles or tetra-alleles. Contamination of
other human cell lines was not found. 100% matched cell
lines were found in DSMZ and ATCC data banks, and
the cell line is named as ARPE-19. The sample analyzed
was shown to be a human cell line, and no contamination
of cells from other species (Cricetulus griseus, Macaca
mulatta, Cercopithecus aethiops, Rattus norvegicus, Mus
musculus, Bos Taurus, IC) was found. The ARPE-19 cells
were cultured in DMEM (Corning) supplemented 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was
purchased (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured
in RPMI-1640 (Corning) containing 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. The RAW264.7 cells were
characterized by fluorescence staining using F4/80
antibody (AbD Serotec, MCA497) and CD11b antibody
(BD Biosciences, 553308) as markers for macrophages.
Briefly, the cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed
with cold fixative (4% PFA) for 20 minutes. The cells were
washed with cold PBS and permeabilized with 0.25%
Triton in PBS for 5 minutes and washed with cold PBS
for three times. The cells were blocked with 5% BSA in
PBS for 30 minutes. Primary F4/80 or CD11b antibodies
were diluted in 5% BSA and incubated with the cells for
2 hours at room temperature. The cells were washed with
PBST for 3 times followed by incubation with secondary
antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were
washed 3 times with PBST followed by DAPI staining and
imaged using a microscope. More than 95% of the cells
were F4/80+ and CD11b+ (data not shown).
All the cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2.
For VEGF-A neutralization, human or mouse cells were

Iba1 and SMA immunofluorescence staining
Three days after laser treatment, the eyes were
harvested and embedded into OCT for frozen sections
at 10 µm thickness. All the sections were collected and
analyzed. The sections were dried at room temperature for
10 min and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min.
After washing with PBS, the sections were permeabilized
with 0.3% Tritonx-100 in PBS for 15 minutes and washed
with PBS for three times. The sections were blocked with
5% BSA at room temperature for 1 hour. Then primary
Iba1 (019-19741, WAKO) or SMA (A2547, Sigma)
antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA and incubated with
the sections overnight at 4°C. The sections were washed
with PBS for 3 times followed by incubation with the
respective secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room
temperature protected from light. The sections were

plated into 6-cm culture plates. At about 60% confluence,
the cells were starved overnight and treated with VEGF-A
neutralizing antibodies (AF-493-NA for mouse VEGF-A,
AF-293-NA for human VEGF-A, 5 μg/ml; R&D Systems)
or control IgG (AB-108-C, 5μg/ml; R&D Systems) for 24
and 48 hours with no or 1% FBS. The cells were harvested
for analysis using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 150
mMNaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, and
0.1% SDS) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktails (Thermo Scientific). TRIzol (Life Technology)
was used for protein or RNA extraction. To detect secreted
PDGF-CC protein, the conditioned serum-free medium
from cultured cells were collected and subjected to
precipitation using ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) as
described [33]. Precipitated protein was washed several
times with ice-cold acetone to remove residual TCA. SDSPAGE assays were performed and followed by Western
blot.

The quality of RNA was verified using 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis (Seakem GTG; FMC Bioproducts,
Rockland, ME) and spectrophotometry. One microgram
of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a
PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TAKARA Biotechnology)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Real-time
PCR was performed using qPCR SYBR® Green Master
Mix (Roche) and a Roche 480 Light Cycler. The results
were analyzed using a 480 Light Cycler software. All
experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated
twice. The PCR cycles consisted of an initial denaturation
step at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for
15 sec and 60°C for 60 sec. The primers used are listed in
Table 1.

Western blot
Cultured cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold
PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150
mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate and
0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitor and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Scientific). The cell
lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants collected.
Protein concentrations were determined using a DCTM
protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, 5000111). Conditioned
serum-free medium was collected and protein
precipitated using ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA)
as described [41]. For retinae and choroids, the tissues
were put into RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Scientific)
and homogenized, centrifuged, and protein samples
collected. The protein samples with DTT (0.1M) were
separated on a 10 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with
the following primary antibodies at 4°C overnight: anti-

siRNA transfection
The cells were plated into 6-well tissue culture
plates and maintained until about 70-80% confluent.
VEGF-A siRNA or control siRNAs were transfected into
the cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. After 24 hours,
the transfection medium was replaced with serum-free
medium and the cells were continuously incubated at 37°C
with 5% CO2 for 24 hours and the cells were harvested for
protein analysis.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life
Technology) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
