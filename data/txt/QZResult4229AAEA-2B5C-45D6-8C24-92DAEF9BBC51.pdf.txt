BACKGROUND: In previous studies of frontline therapy for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), early treatment
with higher doses of anthracyclines has been reported to improve outcome. The current study was conducted to
evaluate whether addition of anthracycline-based consolidation chemotherapy (Course 2) with liposomal daunorubicin (150 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on Days 1 and 2) and cytarabine (1.5 g/m2 IV on Days 1 and 2) to the standard
hyper-CVAD regimen (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with
high dose methotrexate and cytarabine) would improve outcome. METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive adults with de
novo ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma were treated with this modified hyper-CVAD regimen inclusive of rituximab for
CD20 expression 20%. RESULTS: Sixty-three (93%) patients achieved complete response (CR). With a median follow-up of 90 months, the 5-year CR duration (CRD) and overall survival (OS) rates were 46% and 44%, respectively.
Compared with 208 patients treated with standard hyper-CVAD (rates of 45% and 47%, respectively; P ¼ not significant), outcome with the modified hyper-CVAD regimen was not improved overall. Outcome was improved by the
addition of rituximab for the CD20-positive subset (rates of CRD and OS of 50% and 53%, respectively), whereas
anthracycline intensification worsened outcome for the CD20-negative subset (rates of CRD and OS of 41% and 35%,
respectively; P ¼ .01) compared with standard hyper-CVAD. A high mortality rate related to infections in CR was
noted among patients aged 60 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the hyper-CVAD regimen, early
anthracycline intensification did not improve outcome for adults with de novo ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma. CanC 2010 American Cancer Society.

The outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved significantly over the past 50 years. Progress has occurred predominantly as a result of judicious application of combinations of anti-ALL drugs in optimized
sequences of induction, consolidations, maintenance, and central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis.1-3 The complete
response (CR) rates with modern frontline intensive regimens in pediatric ALL are currently 95% or better, and the cure
rates exceed 80%. Using similar therapeutic strategies in adult ALL has improved the CR rates to 90%, but overall the
cure rates remain in the range of 30% to 50%.4-7 In younger adults with de novo ALL, the application of pediatric regimens that intensify the relatively nonmyelosuppressive components, such as corticosteroids, vincristine, and asparaginase,
has shown promising results.8-11 Alternative approaches to intensification include the incorporation of targeted agents for
specific subtypes of adult ALL. These approaches have significantly improved the prognosis of subsets previously associated with particularly poor outcomes with chemotherapy alone, exemplified by the addition of rituximab for Burkitt type
and mature B-cell ALL and by the use of selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL.12-14
Despite the success of these interventions, further progress is needed, especially for adults with other ALL subtypes.
The use of autologous intensification in first CR has proven to be inferior to continuation of chemotherapy.15 Several

alternative therapeutic strategies have been proposed,
including allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in
first remission (for both standard and high-risk
patients15,16), incorporation of novel agents into frontline
therapy such as monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab17)
directed against surface antigens on lymphoblasts, and liposomal preparations of standard chemotherapeutics (eg,
sphingosomal vincristine18,19).
Todeschini et al20 studied dose-intensive anthracycline regimens and the impact of this therapeutic strategy
on outcome for adult ALL. They first showed that the cumulative dose and the dose intensity of daunorubicin
delivered during induction therapy was a significant prognostic factor for survival.20 They subsequently developed
a frontline chemotherapy regimen that incorporated
higher doses of daunorubicin during induction. The median cumulative dose of daunorubicin delivered was 275
mg/m2, and the dose intensity was 38 mg/m2 weekly.21
The investigators reported a higher CR rate with this regimen compared with their previous experience, and a
favorable 6-year estimated survival rate of 55%. Other
investigators have also reported improved outcomes with
higher doses of anthracyclines for adult ALL.22-24
Although no significant toxicities were observed in
the study conducted by Todeschini and others,21 a
higher cumulative dose of anthracyclines may be associated with significant and delayed cardiotoxicity, which
would be of importance in a potentially curable population. Encapsulated formulations of chemotherapeutic
agents have been shown to improve efficacy and to
reduce toxicity. The liposomal preparation of daunorubicin appears to achieve greater neoplastic tissue concentrations, better tumor cell delivery, and immunity to
modulation by the multidrug resistance (MDR) drug
transport system.25-27 It has been administered in cumulative doses >1000 mg/m2 without cardiotoxicity.25
Our previous studies with liposomal daunorubicin and
cytarabine in acute leukemias had demonstrated efficacy
and safety.28-30 Phase 1 studies in acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) determined that liposomal daunorubicin could be given safely at a dose of 100 to 125 mg/m2
daily for 3 days (total dose 300-375 mg/m2 per course).
Among 42 patients treated, 79% of whom had previously received anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the
incidence of cardiotoxicity was only 2%.29
The hyper-CVAD regimen (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone
alternating with high dose methotrexate and cytarabine),
an intensive program modeled after a pediatric regimen

designed for childhood Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, has
proven to be an effective frontline therapy for adults with
de novo ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma.4,5,31,32 On
the basis of the encouraging data with early anthracycline
intensification, we modified the standard hyper-CVAD
regimen by incorporating a postinduction course of liposomal daunorubicin-based chemotherapy to confirm the
results reported by other investigators, and to test the hypothesis that this intervention might improve outcome by
overcoming leukemia resistance with elimination of residual malignant clones. On the basis of our previous findings regarding the poor prognostic impact of CD20
expression on outcome in B-lymphoblastic leukemia and
the encouraging results with hyper-CVAD with rituximab
in Burkitt type ALL, we also incorporated the anti-CD20
monoclonal antibody rituximab.12,33 Herein we report
the long-term outcome after treatment with this modified
hyper-CVAD regimen, expanding on the previously
reported experience in a small cohort of patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma.32

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Adults with previously untreated ALL or lymphoblastic
lymphoma referred to our institution from May 2000
until November 2001 were treated with the modified
hyper-CVAD regimen (Table 1). The protocol was
approved by the institutional review board at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Informed
consent for participation was obtained in accordance with
institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Eligibility criteria included age at least 15 years in the
absence of other active malignancy with expected consequent death within 12 months or known positivity for
human immunodeficiency virus-1. No exclusions were
made because of performance status; cardiac, hepatic, or renal function; or concomitant active infection. Mature Bcell ALL, Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma, or Philadelphiapositive ALL subtypes were treated on separate protocols,
and were also excluded from the comparative historical control group treated with standard hyper-CVAD.12,13 Entry
criteria were similar during the 2 study periods.
The diagnosis of ALL was established according to
World Health Organization criteria.34 Pretreatment evaluations included history/physical examination; complete
blood/platelet/differential counts; serum chemistry,
including hepatic and renal function studies; bone marrow aspiration/biopsy for morphologic analysis and

modified hyper-CVAD regimen32 is similar to standard
hyper-CVAD except for: 1) addition of consolidation
with Course 2 of liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine (9 vs
8 total cycles of induction-consolidation); 2) addition of 8
standard doses of rituximab in the first 4 courses for
CD20-positive ALL; 3) alteration in number of intrathecal (IT) treatments based on CNS risk (reduced from 16
to 8 for high risk, increased from 4 to 6 for low risk); 4)
administration of induction course in a laminar airflow
room or Protective Environment (PE) if age 60 years; 5)
extension of the 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, vincristine, prednisone (POMP) maintenance phase by 6
months; and 6) addition of early and late intensifications
with hyper-CVAD (rituximab) followed by methotrexate and L-asparaginase during the maintenance phase.
Allogeneic SCT in first CR was considered for the poor
risk karyotype t(4;11)(q21;q23) or failure to achieve marrow CR after 1 course.
The major modifications to the induction-consolidation phase of the standard hyper-CVAD regimen
included the addition of Course 2 with liposomal daunorubicin 150 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) over 12 hours daily
on Days 1 and 2 beginning 6 hours after completion of
rituximab (if administered); cytarabine 1.5 g/m2 continuous infusion IV on Days 1 and 2; and prednisone 200 mg
orally daily on Days 1 to 5. If bone marrow lymphoblasts
were CD20-positive (20%), rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV
was given for 8 total doses over the first 4 courses (Table
1). The intensive cycles were administered every 21 days
or earlier (at least 14 days apart) when the white blood cell
count was 3  109/L (at least 24 hours from last dose of
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and untransfused
platelet count was 50 to 60  109/L. Antibiotic prophylaxis during the dose-intensive (induction-consolidation)
and maintenance phases was given as previously
described.32
Therapy for active CNS leukemia at presentation
included alternating IT treatments twice weekly during
the induction course until the cerebrospinal fluid cell
count normalized and cytological examination was negative for malignant cells on 2 sequential assessments, then
weekly for 4 weeks, then according to the prophylactic
schedule for all remaining cycles of intensive chemotherapy. Therapeutic radiation therapy was given if indicated
(eg, 24-30 Gray in 10-12 fractions to the base of the skull
for cranial nerve palsies). No prophylactic cranial irradiation was administered.
Dose reductions were applied as follows: 1) cytarabine 1 g/m2 for age 60 years, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, or

methotrexate level at 0 hour (repeated) 20 lmol/L; 2)
vincristine 1 mg for total bilirubin >2 mg/dL or grade 2
persistent peripheral neuropathy; 3) vincristine eliminated
for total bilirubin >3 mg/dL, grade 3 to 4 peripheral neuropathy, or grade 3 to 4 ileus; 4) doxorubicin decreased by
50% for total bilirubin 2 to 3 mg/dL, by 75% if 3 to 5
mg/dL, and eliminated if >5 mg/dL; and 5) methotrexate
decreased by 50% for calculated creatinine clearance 10 to
50 mL/min (eliminated if <10 mL/min) or if pleural effusions/ascites (with thoracentesis/paracentesis as feasible),
or decreased by 25% to 50% for delayed excretion, nephrotoxicity, or grade 3 or greater mucositis with prior
courses.
Response and Toxicity Criteria and
Statistical Methods
Response criteria were standard.5 Survival was measured
from start of therapy until death from any cause. CR duration (CRD) was measured from achievement of CR until
evidence of leukemia recurrence (10% lymphoblasts in
bone marrow or extramedullary disease recurrence). Overall survival (OS) and CRD distributions were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared using the
log-rank test.35 Differences in response rates were analyzed using a chi-square test.

RESULTS
Study Group
Characteristics of the 68 patients treated with the modified hyper-CVAD regimen are summarized in Table 2.
Their median age was 40 years (range, 18-83 years); 27
(40%) were 50 years or older, and 16 (24%) were 60 years
or older. Leukocyte count 30  109/L was noted in 16
(24%).
Outcome
Sixty-three (93%) patients achieved CR within a median
time of 23 days. Other responses included 1 (1%) CR
with incomplete platelet recovery, 3 (4%) partial
responses, and 1 (1%) induction death, the latter related
to systemic bacterial-fungal infections. Response by pretreatment characteristics is shown in Table 3. The CR rate
for patients aged <30 years was 95% versus 100% among
patients aged 60 years or older. Given the small cohort
size and high CR rates, no significant prognostic factors
for response were identified (Table 3).

The median follow-up time was 90 months (range,
24-107 months). No patients underwent autologous or
allogeneic SCT in first CR. The median OS was 41
months; 5-year OS and CRD rates were 44% and 46%,
respectively (Fig. 1). Older age was associated with a sig-

nificantly worse survival (Table 3). Seven of the 9 deaths
in CR were in patients aged 60 years or older (median, 72
years; range, 61-80 years); 6 were related to infections,
with 1 from bleeding complications of thrombocytopenia. The other 2 deaths in CR were in younger patients
(ages 35 and 37 years), 1 from multiple infections (cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii) on Day 42 of Course
6 of high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine, and the other
from complications of hepatitis B reactivation during
POMP maintenance therapy. Mortality rates in CR were
44% for older versus 4% for younger subsets, P < .001.
Three (all in the older group) of the 9 infection-related
deaths occurred after Course 2 of liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine.

CNS Disease
Four patients presented with CNS disease; 3 achieved
both systemic and CNS remission, and 2 developed disease recurrence with systemic disease only.
Among 64 patients without initial CNS involvement, 5 (8%) had CNS recurrence: 4 isolated (before systemic disease recurrence) and 1 concomitant with bone
marrow recurrence.

Side Effects
Side effects of the modified hyper-CVAD regimen were
similar to standard hyper-CVAD, as detailed in previous
reports.5,32 During Course 2 of liposomal daunorubicincytarabine, the only severe (grade 3-4) nonhematological
toxicity was gastrointestinal (n ¼ 1). The incidence of
grade 1 to 2 mucositis was 8%. No significant cardiotoxicity was observed. Thirty-two (48%) patients developed
febrile episodes: documented bacterial infections in 3,
fungal infections in 2, mixed or multiple infections in 6,
and fever of unknown origin in 21. Three older patients
died subsequent to Course 2 from myelosuppressionrelated complications. For the liposomal daunorubicincytarabine courses, the median time to recovery of granulocytes to >109/L was 17 days and to platelet counts
>100  109/L was 20 days, not significantly different
from the hyper-CVAD or methotrexate-cytarabine
courses. Four of the 25 patients with CD20-positive ALL
treated with modified hyper-CVAD with rituximab subsequently developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome
(n ¼ 3) or AML (n ¼ 1) and were treated accordingly,
eventually dying from refractory disease or complications
of therapy.

Outcome With First Salvage Therapy
Twenty-seven (43%) of 63 patients who achieved CR
with the modified hyper-CVAD regimen subsequently
developed disease recurrence within a median of 14
months (range, 2-48 months). There were no significant
pretreatment predictors for duration of CR (Table 3). Of
the 12 patients with first CRD <1 year, the median age
was 40 years (range, 21-72 years). Three (27%) of the 11
treated patients achieved CR with asparaginase-based salvage chemotherapy. Of the 15 patients with first CRD
>1 year, the median age was 35 years (range, 19-76 years).
Eight (53%) patients achieved CR with hyper-CVADbased salvage chemotherapy (inclusive of rituximab and/
or L-asparaginase). Two of the 12 patients who achieved
second CR remained long-term survivors after allogeneic
SCT.

Comparison of Modified With Standard
Hyper-CVAD
The results with the modified hyper-CVAD regimen
were compared with those of 208 patients treated with
standard hyper-CVAD. The characteristics of the
patients in each treatment cohort were similar (data
not shown). There was no difference in response outcomes between the 2 regimens (Table 4). This was
expected because the induction therapy is similar
except for the incorporation of rituximab for the
CD20-positive subset in the modified hyper-CVAD
regimen. Similarly, as shown in Figure 1, the rates of
OS and CRD were not improved with the addition of
liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine. In fact, when comparing 5-year CRD and OS rates by therapy within the
CD20-negative subset, the outcome was worse with the
modified hyper-CVAD regimen (41% vs 52% [P ¼
.07] and 35% vs 53% [P ¼ .01], respectively) (Fig. 2,
Top). In contrast, the use of rituximab in the modified
hyper-CVAD regimen for the CD20-positive ALL subset produced better 5-year CRD and OS rates when
compared with standard hyper-CVAD (50% vs 40%
[P ¼ .06] and 53% vs 40% [P ¼ .14], respectively)
(Fig. 2, Bottom).

DISCUSSION
The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the addition
of higher doses of anthracyclines early during the course
of frontline therapy might improve the prognosis of de
novo non–Burkitt-type Philadelphia-negative adult ALL
or lymphoblastic lymphoma. This was based on previous
observations reporting encouraging results with this therapeutic strategy.20,21 We elected to use the liposomal preparation of daunorubicin owing to its purported efficacy
against MDR and cardioprotective properties.25-27 With

the (Top) CD20-negative and (Bottom) CD20-positive
subsets.

this and other modifications to the standard hyperCVAD regimen, which included additional cycles of
hyper-CVAD as early/late intensifications during maintenance therapy, the planned cumulative dose of doxorubicin was 300 mg/m2 and of liposomal daunorubicin was
300 mg/m2. Despite the significant anthracycline exposure, the incidence of severe cardiotoxicity was not
increased. Unfortunately, in the context of the hyperCVAD regimen, the anthracycline intensification early in
the consolidation phase (liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine during Course 2) did not improve the outcome.
Overall, the modified hyper-CVAD regimen produced
similar 5-year OS and CRD rates compared with standard
hyper-CVAD (Fig. 1).
In addition to the early anthracycline intensification, we incorporated standard dose rituximab into the

Cancer

October 1, 2010

modified hyper-CVAD regimen for CD20-positive ALL
subsets in a dosing schema modeled after our experience
with Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma.12 The use of rituximab
for the CD20-positive B-lymphoblastic subset appeared
to partially offset the negative influence of the anthracycline intensification on CRD and OS, which was significantly more evident in the CD20-negative subset (5-year
OS rates for modified hyper-CVAD vs standard hyperCVAD within the CD20-positive subset were 53% vs
40% [P ¼ .14] compared with 35% vs 53% in the CD20negative subset [P ¼ .01]) (Fig. 2). Preliminary data from
an ensuing frontline program treating a larger cohort of
CD20-negative patients with de novo ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma with the same modified hyper-CVAD
regimen except for omission of the early anthracycline
consolidation cycle have shown that the 3-year CRD and
OS rates observed in this study have improved from 50%
to 84% and 44% to 63%, respectively.36
In adolescents and young adults, several retrospective studies have shown superior outcomes with pediatric
regimens, which generally intensify the nonmyelosuppressive components of therapy (eg, corticosteroids, vincristine, asparaginase) by several-fold (vs conventional adult
ALL regimens), with anthracycline intensification reserved for only very high-risk pediatric cases.9-11 The difficulties encountered in the prospective application of
pediatric regimens to adults relates to ascertaining the
optimal age cutoff that should be used to designate the
younger adult most likely to benefit from this therapeutic
approach. Huguet and colleagues8 used a pediatricinspired treatment regimen in adults with de novo ALL
up to the age of 60 years. The results of their GRAALL2003 study showed poorer tolerance of the regimen in
adults older than 45 years of age, with a higher incidence
of induction deaths (23% vs 5%; P < .001) and deaths in
first CR (22% vs 5%; P < .001). Reduced dose intensity
of the asparaginase and delays in initiation of consolidation were also noted in this older subgroup, although this
did not translate into a higher cumulative incidence of disease recurrence (20% vs 25%; p ¼ not significant).
In our study, 9 (14%) of 63 patients died in first CR
after treatment with the modified hyper-CVAD regimen
(6 without and 3 with rituximab), mostly related to infectious complications of myelosuppression. These included
7 (44%) of the 16 patients who were 60 years of age or
older. The high mortality rate in CR had also been
observed in the larger experience with the hyper-CVAD
regimens, which has prompted truncation of the dose-intensive phase of chemotherapy and earlier transition to

4587

maintenance phase among older patients once a lifethreatening complication has occurred.37 Three of these
deaths occurred after the liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine course, again suggesting that the increased anthracycline dose intensity was not beneficial overall, and may
have been particularly detrimental among older patients.
In summary, our results with the modified hyperCVAD regimen incorporating early dose-intensive
anthracycline-based consolidation chemotherapy did not
show improved outcome compared with the prior experience with standard hyper-CVAD. The augmented hyperCVAD regimen, which intensifies the dexamethasone and
vincristine components and incorporates L-asparaginase38
or pegylated asparaginase,39 has shown encouraging
results in the salvage setting, with poorer tolerance in the
older adults, as expected. Alternative strategies to chemotherapy intensification, including incorporation of targeted agents (eg, other monoclonal antibodies directed at
other surface antigens on lymphoblasts), use of other
novel chemotherapeutic agents with minimal toxicity (eg,
sphingosomal vincristine18,19), and integration of modulators of resistance mechanisms (eg, bcl-2 inhibitors,
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors), will be
needed to improve the prognosis of older adults with
ALL.
