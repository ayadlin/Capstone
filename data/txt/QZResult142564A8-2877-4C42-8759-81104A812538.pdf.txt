ABSTRACT
Energy metabolism in cancer cells is often increased to meet their higher
proliferative rate and biosynthesis demands. Suppressing cancer cell metabolism
using agents like metformin has become an attractive strategy for treating cancer
patients. We showed that a novel ginsenoside derivative, Rh2E2, is as effective as
aspirin in preventing the development of AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer and
suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in a LLC-1 xenograft. A sub-chronic and
acute toxicity LD50 test of Rh2E2 showed no harmful reactions at the maximum oral
dosage of 5000 mg/kg body weight in mice. Proteomic profiling revealed that Rh2E2
specifically inhibited ATP production in cancer cells via down-regulation of metabolic
enzymes involving glycolysis, fatty acid β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle,
leading to specific cytotoxicity and S-phase cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. Those
findings suggest that Rh2E2 possesses a novel and safe anti-metabolic agent for
cancer patients by specific reduction of energy-based metabolism in cancer cells.

enzyme expression (e.g. aldolase A, α-enolase, lactate
dehydrogenase and fatty acid synthase) [6, 7], mutation
(such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1/2) [8, 9], posttranslational inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase [10], and substitution of a different enzyme isoform
(e.g., the pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, PKM2) [11].
Therefore, inhibiting multiple mechanisms to reduce or
reverse the abnormal reprogrammed metabolism of cancer
cells, particularly reducing energy-based metabolism, is
an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer patients [3].
However, inhibition of glycolysis produced limited
effect on tumorigenesis because anti-glycolysis treatment
could drive tumor cells to demand more glutamine for
ATP production via glutaminolysis [12]. Therefore, a
new generation of therapeutics, network-based holistic

INTRODUCTION
F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography
(FDG-PET) is often used to visualize the increased
glucose uptake in tumors of patients [1]. The proliferating
cancer cells exhibit a higher cell metabolism compared
to most normal differentiated cells [2]. To adapt to
the higher rate of proliferation and division of cancer
cells, demand of the additional nutrients and sufficient
energy are required [3]. Studies of metabolic alteration
and adaptation of cancer cells over the past century
[4] revealed that glycolysis and glutaminolysis are the
major enhanced metabolic pathways for tumor growth
and survival [5]. The inhibition of metabolic status of
tumor cells are multi-dimensional, such as reduced

intervention via suppressing the overall metabolism of
cancer cells and blocking fuel uptake and ATP production
is desirable [13]. The marketed drug metformin exhibits a
reliable anti-tumor effect in both pre-clinical and clinical trials
via multi-pathway suppressions on cancer cell metabolism
including suppressing ATP production through the inhibition
of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I) and fatty
acid oxidation [14, 15]. Metformin can shut down the external
and internal glucose supply to cancer cells by enhancing
insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake and inhibiting
hepatic gluconeogenesis [15, 16]. However, blockage of
gluconeogenesis by metformin may produce potential
adverse effects like lactic acidosis [17]. Thus, identifying
an ideal energy-based metabolic suppressor that specifically
reverses the reprogrammed metabolic status of cancer cells
but not the cell metabolism of normal tissues, is in demand.
Ginsenoside Rh2 (Rh2) could reduce cell
proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, cell
differentiation and apoptosis in variety types of cancer
cells, while 20(R)-Rh2 exhibited no cytotoxic effect
on cancer cells [18–20]. Here, we identified a new
ginsenoside derivative, Rh2E2 modified from 20(R)Rh2, has a potent anti-cancer effect in both in vitro and
in vivo experiments, but with less toxicity on normal cells
and animals. Rh2E2 was unraveled to suppress tumor
growth via down-regulation of metabolic enzymes for
energy production; suppression of oncogenic proteins
for cancer cell invasion, metastasis, proliferation and
cell cycle progression; and activation of ERK-p53/-Egr1
signaling and inhibition of the Skp2 autoinduction loop
for cell cycle arrest. Accordingly, Rh2E2 shows valuable
as a therapeutic inhibitor of metabolism for treating cancer
patients.

As shown in Figure 1B, Rh2E2 exhibited a specific
cytotoxic effect on LLC-1 lung cancer cells, with a mean
IC50 of 56 µM, while it showed no cytotoxic effect on
CCD19Lu human normal lung fibroblasts at doses over 100
µM. Also, Rh2E2 demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic
effect against other cancer cell lines (Figure 1C). However,
20(S)-Rh2, but not 20(R)-Rh2 exhibited cytotoxicity both
in cancerous and normal cells (Figure 1D & 1E). These
results indicate that structural modification of the non-toxic
ginsenoside 20(R)-Rh2 into the ginsenoside Rh2E2 has
induced a change of its cytotoxic properties; i.e., from a
non-specific into a specific property in cancer cells.

Rh2E2 exhibits a chemopreventive effect against
AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer in mice
Panax ginseng has been rapidly increasing in
the Asian countries and Western world as a dietary
supplement for cancer patients. People believe that Panax
ginseng is beneficial for humans without observable
adverse effects. In this study, no cytotoxicity of Rh2E2
was revealed in both normal and cancer cell cultures.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse model was used to
investigate the chemopreventive effect of Rh2E2. In
this model, tumors are induced by combining a single
dose of azoxymethane (AOM) and chronic exposure to
the inflammatory agent dextran sodium sulfate (DSS).
As shown in Figure 2A, the tumor incidence of the
AOM/DSS model was approximately 81%, whereas the
administration of Rh2E2 at 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg and the
positive control drug aspirin [23] decreased the tumor
incidence. The mice treated with Rh2E2 at the dose of 40
mg/kg showed lower tumor number and reduced tumor
volume in colon. The effect of Rh2E2 at 40 mg/kg in
suppressing the tumor multiplicity and tumor volume is
better than aspirin (Figure 2B & Supplementary Figure
S1A & S1B). Furthermore, the increase of spleen weight
in AOM/DSS mice was attenuated by Rh2E2 (40 and 80
mg/kg) and aspirin (50 mg/kg) (Supplementary Figure
S1C). Moreover, the body weight of Rh2E2- and aspirintreated AOM/DSS mice gradually increased, suggesting no
toxic effect of the drugs to animals (Supplementary Figure
S1D). Collectively, Rh2E2 possesses a chemopreventive
effect against colorectal cancer similar to aspirin.

RESULTS
Rh2E2 possesses a specific cytotoxic effect on
cancer cells
The anti-cancer property of Rh2 was only known
for 20S-ginsenoside Rh2 (20(S)-Rh2), but not 20Rginsenoside Rh2 (20(R)-Rh2) [18, 19]. However, the poor
solubility of 20(S)-Rh2 limits its value as a potential antitumor agent. We therefore tried to modify its chemical
structure of 20(R)-Rh2 so as to improve its solubility and
enhance its anti-cancer potency. As shown in Figure 1A,
the double bond on the side chain of 20(R)-Rh2 was
oxidized with oxone/NaHCO3 in the presence of a ketone
catalyst, forming 24, 25-epoxy compounds [21]. The
hydroxyl group located at C-20 of these epoxides attacked
the electron-demand C-24 to form 20, 24-epoxides in a
1:1 mixture of 24-epimers [22], which was validated
by UPLC-MS analysis and purified by ODS column
chromatography (90% methanol). The structure of Rh2E2
was characterized by positive high-resolution ESI-MS and
its molecular formula is C36H62O9.

In vivo anti-tumor effect of Rh2E2 was further
assessed in a lung cancer xenograft model. As shown in
Figure 2C, intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Rh2E2 at 5 and
10 mg/kg/day demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition
of tumor growth up to 18.72% (P < 0.05) and 34.34%
(P < 0.01), respectively. Treatment with Rh2E2 showed
no reduction in body weight or vital organs, suggesting a

non-toxic property of Rh2E2 (Supplementary Figures S1E
& S2). Oral administration of Rh2E2 at 40 and 80 mg/
kg/day demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth up to 44.28% (P < 0.05) and 52.2% (P < 0.01),
respectively, while the positive control drugs 5-Fu, (R/S)Rh2 and Rg3 had little or no anti-tumor effect (Figure
2D). IP injection and oral administration of Rh2E2 neither
reduced body weights nor had any observable adverse
effects in mice (Supplementary Figures S1E-F, S2 & S3).
The therapeutic safety window of Rh2E2 was further
evaluated by oral administration of its sub-chronic lethal
dose and acute lethal dose. Up to 320 mg/kg/day of Rh2E2
indicated no harmful effect to animals, showing 100% of
the animals survived and no decline in body weight after

a 7-day treatment course (Figure 2E). The acute oral
toxicity of Rh2E2 was assessed using the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
Guideline for Testing Chemicals (the sections “Acute Oral
Toxicity” and “Acute Toxic Class Method”). Based on the
sub-chronic lethal dose shown in Figure 2E, 2000 mg/kg
of Rh2E2 was selected as a starting dose to evaluate the
oral acute toxicity of Rh2E2; while death did not occur in
animals in either gender, and no decline in body weight
and no toxic signs were observed (Figure 2F). According
to the OECD Test Guideline 423, Rh2E2 could be either
classified as Class 5 or unclassified under the Globally
Harmonized Classification System (GHS), and its LD50
was therefore estimated to be greater than 5000 mg/kg.

than the normal lung fibroblasts, which suggests that LLC1 cancer cells metastasized from the subcutaneous dorsal
region to the lung tissues. Only one of the six Rh2E2treated mice had PCNA-stained LLC-1 cells in the lung
tissues, which indicated that Rh2E2 could inhibit the
metastasis of LLC-1 cancer cells in vivo (Figure 3A). The
average percentage of tumor necrotic areas (black arrow)
reached approximately 30% in vehicle-treated mice, in
which tumor tissues were accompanied with rich blood

tumor necrotic areas were increased, up to approximately
60%, in Rh2E2-treated animals, in which the tumor tissues
contained less blood vessel formation (Figure 3B). In Situ

the six vehicle-treated mice in the control group gave a
strong PCNA signal throughout the lung tissue sections,

apoptosis and angiogenesis [28–39] (Figure 4A).
Among those 13 proteins, 6 were identified by 2D-DIGE
analysis, including α-enolase, complement C3, alpha2-macroglobulin, stathmin, cofilin-1 and Rho GDPdissociation inhibitor 1 (Supplementary Figure S4),
whereas 7 were identified from iTRAQ analysis, including
thromboxane-A synthase, regulator of G-protein signaling
19, Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoE, Rho-related
BTB domain-containing protein 3, cadherin-2, zinc
transporter 4, and galectin-7 (Figure 4A). These results
suggested that the combination of the 2D-DIGE and
iTRAQ analytical methods could enhance the coverage of
protein identification. Furthermore, the identified proteins
were validated by Western blotting (Figure 4B). Taken
together, Rh2E2 could suppress in vivo tumor growth
via modulation of proteins involved in cell invasion,
proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis of
cancer cells.

Rh2E2 down-/up-regulates protein expression
involving invasion, proliferation, cell cycle
progression and apoptosis of cancer cells
We have optimized the method of isoelectric focusing
(IEF) in 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D) of mouse
tumor tissues, leading to an enhancement of protein
identification and reproducibility [26, 27]. We therefore
combined 2D-DIGE and iTRAQ proteomic techniques to
maximize the identification of protein spots from tumor
tissues of Rh2E2-treated mice. Among 2670 protein spots
identified in 2D-DIGE-MALDI-TOF/TOF using peptide
mass fingerprinting, 48 proteins in tumor tissues (p < 0.05)
were differentially expressed between the vehicle- or
Rh2E2-treated animals; 34 proteins were down-regulated
and 14 proteins were up-regulated (Supplementary Table
S1). A total of 6667 protein spots were identified by using
iTRAQ analysis. Among these identified proteins, 98
proteins (p < 0.05) were differentially expressed between
the vehicle- and Rh2E2-treated mice. In Rh2E2-treated
mice, 59 proteins were up-regulated, whereas 39 proteins
were down-regulated (Supplementary Table S2).

expressed proteins identified by 2D-DIGE and iTRAQ,

Knockdown of α-enolase and stathmin in H1299
potentiates the Rh2E2-inhibited cancer cell
invasion
In view of the anti-metastatic effect of Rh2E2
in vivo (Figure 3A), proteomic profiling provided evidence
that several tumor metastatic markers, such as α-enolase,
stathmin, cofilin-1, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 and
thromboxane-A synthase [31–34, 40], probably participate
in the anti-metastatic actions of Rh2E2. The suppressed
metastatic proteins, α-enolase and stathmin, were further
studied. Consistent with the Western blot validation shown
9911

Oncotarget

in Figure 4B, IHC staining of tumor tissues confirmed that
both α-enolase and stathmin were suppressed in Rh2E2treated mice (Figure 5A & 5B). Transwell chamber
assays showed that sub-lethal doses of Rh2E2 could
dose-dependently suppress the cell invasion ability of
the human lung cancer cells H1299 (Figure 5C). Protein
markers for cell adhesion, cell invasion and angiogenesis

were all down-regulated upon Rh2E2 treatment (Figure
5D). Knockdown of α-enolase and stathmin in H1299 cells
retarded the cell’s invasive ability, and Rh2E2 in these
knockdown cells further destroyed the invasive ability of
H1299 (Figure 5E). The suppression of either α-enolase
or stathmin is required for the Rh2E2-retarded cancer cell
invasion and tumor metastasis.

Rh2E2 specifically suppresses cancer cell
metabolism via inhibition of metabolic enzymes
in mitochondrion

the level of ATP production (Figure 6B), which suggests
that Rh2E2 exhibits a biphasic effect on energy production
between normal and cancer cells. We addressed whether
Rh2E2 treatment suppresses the key metabolic enzymes of
mitochondria. As shown in Figure 6C, proteomic analysis
revealed that several key enzymes involved in fatty acid
β-oxidation, including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoylCoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and
beta-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were all down-regulated
in Rh2E2-treated LLC-1 cancer cells but not in normal
lung fibroblasts (Supplementary Tables S3 & S4).
Concomitantly, the level of metabolic enzymes in the TCA
cycle including aconitase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,
succinyl-CoA synthetase, succinic dehydrogenase and
fumarase were decreased in Rh2E2-treated LLC-1 cancer
cells (Supplementary Table S3). We further validated
the down-regulation of metabolic enzymes in fatty acid
β-oxidation by examining their end product, acetyl-CoA.
In line with the proteomic findings, a reduction in acetylCoA was observed in Rh2E2-treated LLC-1 cells, but

α-enolase is one of the major glycolytic enzyme
used in ATP energy production [28]. Tumor cells require
a large increase in glucose metabolism to support tumor
formation and expansion by inducing the overexpression
of glycolytic enzymes [28]. We therefore determined
whether the down-regulation of α-enolase by Rh2E2 could
decrease glycolysis and energy production. As shown in
Figure 6A and 6B, an equal number of LLC-1 cancer
cells generated less ATP than that of the normal cells
did, owing to the Warburg effect [2], because the cancer
cells adopted the glycolytic pathway, which yields less
ATP than the mitochondrial aerobic oxidation utilized by
normal cells. Rh2E2-treated LLC-1 cancer cells showed
a decrease in ATP production without affecting the ADP
and AMP levels (Figure 6A). By contrast, Rh2E2-treated
human normal lung fibroblasts could effectively reverse

cancer cells. The comparative proteomic analyses, iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS and 2D-DIGE, were combined to maximize the identification of
differentially expressed proteins. For iTRAQ, the peptide-IEF was used for fractionation before LC-MS/MS. MS/MS data was processed
using Bruker Compass Data Analysis software, and the generated peak lists were submitted to MASCOT search engine against SwissProt

DeCyder differential analysis software 7.0 (GE Healthcare). The differentially expressed protein spots were identified by MALDI TOF/
TOF. The MS data were analyzed using FlexAnalysis 3.3 (Bruker Daltonics) and the generated peak list was searched against SwissProt

Rh2E2 induces S-phase cell cycle arrest in LLC-1
cancer cells through decreasing S-phase specific
cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks)/cyclins expression

not in Rh2E2-treated CCD19Lu normal lung fibroblasts,
which suggests that neither the metabolic enzymes nor
the end product of fatty acid β-oxidation were affected in
normal cells by Rh2E2 (Figure 6D). Western blot analysis
confirmed that aconitase was up-regulated, whereas
succinyl-CoA synthetase and fumarase were downregulated in Rh2E2-treated LLC-1 cells (Figure 6E). Upregulation of aconitase together with down-regulation of
α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase led to the accumulation
of the TCA cycle intermediate, α-ketoglutarate. Rh2E2
increased-α-ketoglutarate in LLC-1 cells (Figure 6F),
indicating the TCA cycle was retarded upon Rh2E2
treatment. These findings suggest that Rh2E2 specifically
suppress cell metabolism and energy production in cancer
cells, but not in normal cells.

Metabolic disturbance could influence cell
proliferation and cell cycle progression [41]. Results
indicated that Rh2E2 arrested the cells in S-phase of

inducing S-phase cell cycle arrest. These findings were
in agreement with the results of proteomic analysis,
especially the reduction of energy metabolism.
We then determined the regulators responsible
for S-phase cell cycle arrest upon Rh2E2 treatment. As
shown in Supplementary Figure S5C, Rh2E2 decreased
the expression of cyclin D1 and cdk4, with a moderate
decrease in cyclin A, while the expression of cyclin E and
cdk2 was reduced. These results are in agreement with
other reports that inhibition of the cdk/cyclin complex
activity suppresses cell cycle progression [42]. p21 is
known to bind and inhibit the activity of the cdk4/cyclin
D1 complex, whereas p27 could suppress the activity
of the cdk2/cyclin E complex [43]. Recent studies have
indicated that the tumor suppressor proteins p21 and p27,
as well as p53, suppress the AMPK-related metabolic
pathway and glucose metabolism [44, 45]. We therefore
postulated that Rh2E2 may down-regulate cancer cell
metabolism as well as arrest cell cycle progression via
activation of these tumor suppressors. As expected,
Rh2E2 caused the accumulation of both p21 and p27 in
a dose-dependent manner with the activation of p53. The
expression of c-myc, which acts as a transcriptional factor
for cdks, was also decreased (Supplementary Figure S5D).
Immunoprecipitation (IP) assay showed that the level
of cyclin E or cyclin D in both cdk2/cyclin E and cdk4/
cyclin D complexes was reduced in response to Rh2E2
treatment (Supplementary Figure S5E). IP assay with p21
or p27 further revealed that the level of cdk2 or cdk4 was
increased in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary
Figure S5F), suggesting an enhanced binding inhibition
between both p21 and p27 with cdk/cyclin complexes
upon Rh2E2 treatment. Upon knockdown of p21 and
p27 in LLC-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S6A), the
cell viability could be partially recovered from cell
death induced by Rh2E2 (Supplementary Figure S6B).
Concomitantly, Rh2E2-induced S-phase cell cycle arrest
was partially attenuated in LLC-1 cells after knockdown
of p21 or p27 (Supplementary Figure S6C). These findings
provide evidence that Rh2E2 could enhance the expression
of p21 and p27, which would bind to cdks and cyclins and
suppress their interaction, leading to a loss of cdks/cyclins
complex activity, and contributing to S-phase cell cycle
arrest and cell cytotoxicity.

Cyclin E/Cdk2 and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
gene Rb [47]. In 2013, Chan et al. further unraveled
the role of Skp2 in Akt-induced glycolysis and p53independent cellular senescence [48]. We hypothesized
that Rh2E2 may interrupt cancer cell energy production
and cell cycle progression via the Skp2 autoinduction
loop. As shown in Figure 7A, an increase in p27 was
accompanied by a reduction of skp2 and E2F-1 expression,
as well as dephosphorylation of Rb. We further addressed
the role of skp2 in Rh2E2-induced cell cytotoxicity and
cell cycle arrest by overexpression of FLAG-tagged skp2
in LLC-1 cells. Overexpression of skp2 could enhance
cancer cell viability in the presence of Rh2E2 (Figure
7B), suggesting that Rh2E2-enhanced cytotoxicity was
offset by skp2. Rh2E2 in skp2 overexpressing LLC-1
cells contributed to S-phase cell cycle arrest, although to
a lesser extent (Figure 7C). Taken together, Rh2E2 arrests
LLC-1 cancer cell growth in the S-phase by up-regulation
of p27 via abating the skp2 autoinduction loop.

Rh2E2-enhanced cell cytotoxicity requires
activation of ERK-p53 and ATM-AMPK
signaling
Recent reports indicate that MAPK signaling
contributes to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis
and peripheral tissue energy balance [49]. We found
that ERK activation was required for Rh2E2-induced
cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure S7A, B); while cotreatment of Rh2E2 with U0126 resulted in a decrease
in both ERK- and p53-activated phosphorylation as well
as alleviation of p21 and p27 activation (Supplementary
Figure S7C). These results suggest that ERK is involved
in Rh2E2-reduced cancer cell metabolism and cell death
through an ERK/Egr-1/p21 or /p27 and an ERK/p53/p21
or /p27 -dependent pathway. By contrast, recent studies
revealed that bioenergetic metabolic reduction correlates
with slower DNA replication fork progression and ensures
cell cycle arrest, leading to senescence [50]. Apparently,
Rh2E2 reduced DNA synthesis in LLC-1 cancer cells in
a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S8A).
H2A.X is activated in the retention of the DNA repair
factory at DNA damage sites; it is directly phosphorylated
by ATM in response to DNA damage [51]. Our results
indicated that H2A.X was phosphorylated upon Rh2E2
treatment in LLC-1 cancer cells, but not in CCD19Lu
normal cells (Supplementary Figure S8B). These results
were in agreement with our data showing that Rh2E2
induced specific cytotoxicity, S phase cell cycle arrest
and cell metabolic modulation in LLC-1 cancer cells.
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases (ATM and
ATR) are activated in response to DNA damage/genotoxic
stress for early signal transmission through the cell cycle
checkpoints [52]. We demonstrated that Rh2E2 could
increase ATM protein expression and AMPK and Chk1
phosphorylation, but had little effect on ATR protein

Expression of p27 in Rh2E2-treated LLC-1
cancer cells relies on inhibition of the Skp2
autoinduction loop
Skp2 is a substrate-targeting protein subunit of
the SCFskp2 ubiquitin ligase complex that controls
cell proliferation, especially promoting entry into and
progression through the S phase, by regulating the
degradation of p27 [46]. A recent report introduced the
concept of a Skp2 autoinduction loop, which is a selfamplifying feedback loop compromising Skp2, p27,

expression, whereas ultra-violet (UV) radiation, a wellknown activator of ATM/ATR, induced a high expression
of both kinases (Supplementary Figure S8C & S8D).
By contrast, blockage of Rh2E2-activated ATM/ATR
signaling using specific inhibitors was able to reduce
the Rh2E2-induced cell death and S phase cell cycle
arrest (Supplementary Figure S8E & S8F). These results
suggested the possible involvement of ATM-AMPK
signaling in Rh2E2-induced cell metabolic suppression
and S phase cell cycle arrest.

had suppressive effect on carcinoma growth by inhibition
of energy-based metabolism through suppression of
α-enolase, leading to a selective reduction of ATP energy
production, and inhibition of tumor cell invasion and
metastasis in vivo. Extracellular acidification has been
shown to increase the motility of cells both in vitro and
in vivo, and lactate itself has been shown to directly
increase cell motility [59]. Rh2E2 could suppress
glycolysis via the suppression of α-enolase, leading to
blockage of pyruvate and lactate production. Together,
Rh2E2 is able to intervene in tumor acidification and
inhibit tumor cell invasion.
Recent studies found that cancer cells lacking
the brain-specific metabolic enzyme carnitine
palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C) showed decreased fatty
acid oxidation, reduced ATP generation and increased
sensitivity to metabolic stress [60]. Pharmacological
inhibition of fatty acid oxidation could sensitize human
leukemia cells to cell death [61]. These observations
suggest that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation may be a
therapeutic mechanism in treating cancers. Rh2E2 not
only down-regulated the key metabolic enzymes for fatty
acid oxidation and led to a reduction of acetyl-CoA (a
key substrate of the TCA cycle) in LLC-1 cancer cells,
but also reduced the expression of some mitochondrial
enzymes of the TCA cycle, producing an accumulation
of α-ketoglutarate. Recent studies demonstrated that
glutamate dehydrogenase 1 controls the intracellular level
of α-ketoglutarate, which is important for maintaining
redox homeostasis in cancer cells. Dysregulation of this
mitochondrial enzyme would lead to an accumulation
of α-ketoglutarate and imbalanced redox homeostasis,
leading to attenuated cancer cell proliferation and tumor
growth [62]. Our findings suggest that Rh2E2 suppressed
tumor cell growth via multiple metabolic interventions,
such as energy-based metabolic suppression, by inhibiting
glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and the TCA cycle for ATP
generation.
The tumor suppressor p53 can shut down aerobic
glycolysis (Warburg effect) in cancer cells and also renders
cells to utilize oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria,
thereby minimizing the synthesis of substrates for cell
division [63]. Skp2 promotes cell proliferation and cell
cycle progression in the S-phase by down-regulating the
cdk inhibitor p27 [46]. Apparently, Rh2E2 decreased
energy production by suppressing aerobic glycolysis in
cancer cells, and on the other hand, it arrested the cell cycle
in S-phase with up-regulation of p53 and p27 and downregulation of Skp2. These results suggest that the energybased actions of Rh2E2 facilitate crosstalk among those
signaling pathways. Studies showed that Skp2 deficiency
impairs Akt activation, glucose transporter 1 expression,
and glucose uptake and glycolysis, and suppresses cancer
progression in various tumor models [64]. Recently, a
newly identified Skp2 inhibitor suppresses Akt-mediated
glycolysis as well as triggering p53-independent cellular

DISCUSSION
Small-molecule agents for the specific suppression
of tumors that spare normal host tissues have received
increasing attention in recent years [53]. In the past two
decades, chemicals derived from ginsenosides or active
components from ginseng have been tested [54], providing
solid data to support the application of ginseng in cancer
therapy. The cell energy sensor AMPK has recently been
reviewed as a target for ginseng [55], which suggests
that ginseng or ginsenosides would be valuable in the
treatment and/or prevention of cancer via inhibition of
energy metabolism.
In the current study, we synthesized a ginsenoside
derivative, Rh2E2, based on structural modification of
20(R)-Rh2 that has no anti-cancer effect. In addition
to the tumor specific properties of Rh2E2 in vitro, it
demonstrated a potent chemopreventive effect in an
AOM/DSS colon cancer mouse model with a potency
comparable to aspirin, and effectively suppressed tumor
growth and metastasis in a LLC-1 mouse xenograft by oral
and IP administration. The acute and sub-chronic lethal
doses of Rh2E2 could not be determined, even when the
dosages of Rh2E2 reached a maximum oral dose, because
of the very low toxicity of the drug, which suggests that
the range of the safe therapeutic window is large. Rh2E2
was found to reduce the glycolytic enzyme α-enolase and
the metabolic enzymes involving fatty acid β-oxidation,
leading to a reduction in ATP production. As a result, the
LLC-1 cancer cells with reduced metabolism were arrested
at the S-phase of the cell cycle via activation of the Skp2
autoinduction loop, induction of ERK-p53 signaling,
suppression of cdk/cyclin complexes via cdk inhibitors
of p21 and p27, and induction of genotoxic stress
(Figure 7D).
The enzyme α-enolase is a diagnostic and
therapeutic target of cancers [56]. It is a glycolytic enzyme
in the synthesis of pyruvate and also a multifunctional
protein that acts as a plasminogen receptor to promote cell
migration and metastasis [57]. In cancer cells, α-enolase
is overexpressed, thus enhancing anaerobic proliferation
(Warburg effect) [58]. Also. it is localized at the cell
surface where it facilitates cancer cell invasion [56]. The
current results showed that Rh2E2 had no influence on
energy metabolism in normal cells and tissues. Instead, it

senescence [48]. These findings provide evidence that
Rh2E2 reduces cancer cell metabolism via crosstalk
between Skp2 and p53 signaling, thereby arresting cancer
cell growth in the S-phase. Skp2 inhibitor has anti-cancer
effect in various animal models and cooperates with
chemotherapeutic agents to reduce cancer cell survival
[48]. Those reports not only provide evidence that Skp2
is a target for restricting cancer cell progression, but
also suggest that Rh2E2 is a potent anti-cancer agent by
suppressing Skp2.
It is inevitable that Rh2E2-suppressed energy
metabolism in cancer cells would eventually inhibit
nucleic acid synthesis and induce genotoxic stress,
because DNA synthesis is an energy-demanding process
[65]. The anti-tumor effect of Rh2E2 was demonstrated
by the induction of genotoxic stress on LLC-1 cancer
cells, but not in normal lung fibroblasts through activation
of Chk1 and ATM signaling, leading to phosphorylation
of the genotoxic stress marker H2A.X, and a reduction
in DNA synthesis. However, induced genotoxic stress
may be an indirect mechanism for the anti-tumor effect
of Rh2E2 due to its energy-based inhibition of cellular
metabolism in cancer cells. In normal proliferating cells,
the exogenous pool of nutrients, such as nucleosides, can
supply the nucleotide building blocks. However, because
of the high proliferative burden of cancer cells, tumors
probably rely on endogenous synthesis from glucose and
glutamine via the pentose phosphate pathways (PPP),
glutaminolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA
cycle) [66]. Therefore, the down-regulation of metabolic
enzymes involving glycolysis, fatty acid β-oxidation and
the TCA cycle induced by Rh2E2, might indirectly block
nucleotide biosynthesis and induce genotoxic stress in
cancer cells. Rh2E2 exhibits no suppressive effect on the
above metabolic pathways in normal lung fibroblasts,
showing no genotoxic stress markers in normal cells.
Recently, activation of ATM signaling has been shown to
suppress energy metabolism via activation of the AMPactivated protein kinase, AMPK, which is an energy
sensor of cells [67]. ATM appears to phosphorylate other
signal transducers with metabolic connections, including
p53 [67], suggesting that Rh2E2 might further suppress
cell metabolism via ATM-AMPK-p53 signaling.
The metabolic therapeutic agent metformin has
a potent anti-tumor effect on melanoma, lung, breast,
lymphoma, liver, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, gastric,
ovarian and cervical cancers, either in pre-clinical
studies or in clinical trials, through a multi-pathway
intervention in cancer metabolism [68, 69]. The effective
dosages of metformin for tumor suppression in mice are
approximately 50 mg/day for oral administration [70] and
200mg/kg/day for IP injection [71]; those dosages are
much higher than the effective dosage of Rh2E2 (1 mg/day
for oral administration and 10 mg/kg/day for IP injection).
Most importantly, Rh2E2 had no observable side effects at
effective dosages in mouse models, and has an LD50 value
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of 5000 mg/kg, whereas metformin could induce lactic
acidosis, which may be a considerable safety issue in
clinical applications [17]. The effective dosage of Rh2E2
is higher than that of other chemotherapeutic agents such
as paclitaxel as a first-line anti-cancer agent, but Rh2E2
may be more suitable for developing combined therapy
with other first-line chemotherapeutic agents to produce
synergistic therapeutic efficacy for cancers. The glycolysis
inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose can resensitize tumors to
paclitaxel through reducing tumor ATP levels [12]. Downregulation of α-enolase can further enhance the sensitivity
of tumor cells to anti-tubulin chemotherapeutics (e.g.,
vincristine and taxol) [72]. Therefore, the pharmacological
property of Rh2E2 of specific cytotoxicity to cancer cells
but not to normal cells, as well as the wide range of the
therapeutic safety window, suggests that it could be
developed as a safe and effective adjuvant agent in treating
cancer together with current chemotherapeutic agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of ginsenoside Rh2E2
A mixture of Oxone® mono-persulfate compound
(494.2 mg) and NaHCO3 (210.4 mg) was added slowly
to a solution of 20R-ginsenoside Rh2 (100 mg) in 60 mL
of a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile-Na2(EDTA) (4 × 10−4 M in
water). Shi epoxidation diketal catalyst (Ketone, 124.5 mg)
in 15 mL of acetronitrile was then added dropwise during
a period of 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was allowed
to stand overnight at room temperature with magnetical
stirring. After filtration and removal of acetronitrile in
vacuum, the reaction solution was directly loaded to an
ODS column and eluted from 50% to 90% methanol to
afford 20R-Rh2 20,24-epoxides (70 mg) in an equivalent
mixture of 24-epimers, i.e. 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl
20R,24S-epoxydammarane-3β,12β-triol and 3-O-β-Dglucopyranosyl
20R,24R-epoxydammarane-3β,12βtriol (Rh2E2) as illustrated in Scheme 1. Identification
of Rh2E2 was described in supplementary information.
Several grams of Rh2E2 were synthesized according to
the above procedure.

detected by Annexin V staining kit (BD Biosciences).
siRNA knockdown was performed using X-tremeGENE
siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche). To investigate the
effect of MAPK inhibitors on Rh2E2-induced cell death,
confluent cell cultures were co-incubated with Rh2E2 in
the presence of the following inhibitors: 20 μM U0126
(ERK inhibitor), 2.5 μM SP600125 (JNK inhibitor),
2.5 μM SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), 10 μM Pifithrin-α
(p53 inhibitor). For cell cycle analysis, the cells were
harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and then suspended and permeabilized
with 70% ethanol for overnight at 4°C. For detecting
DNA content and cell cycle, cells were incubated with
the freshly prepared propidium iodide (PI) staining buffer
for 30 min at room temperature in dark. Fractions of the
cells in G1, S, and G2/M phase were analyzed using
Modfit software 3.1. The cancer cell invasion assay was
performed in a Cell Invasion Chamber, a 24-well tissue
culture plate with cell culture inserts that contain an 8
mm pore size polycarbonate membrane over a thin layer
of dried ECMatrix™ (CHEMICON). Detail protocol was
