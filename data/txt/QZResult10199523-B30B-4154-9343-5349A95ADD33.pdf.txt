BACKGROUND. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancy (HM). There are 2 lipid formulations of amphotericin B (AMB) currently in widespread use: AMB lipid complex
(ABLC) and liposomal AMB (L-AMB). There are limited data comparing the efficacy and safety of these 2 agents in the treatment of IA in patients with cancer.

METHODS. The authors retrospectively studied 381 consecutive patients with HM
MD

who had proven or probable IA (according to European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases criteria) between June 1993 and December

2005. Of these patients, 158 received primary antifungal therapy with either
L-AMB (n 5 106) or ABLC (n 5 52). The number of salvage antifungal regimens
given were 51 L-AMB regimens and 30 ABLC regimens. It should be noted that
the population described in this report was not typical of the hematologic cancer
population with IA because of the advanced stage and the severity of the underlying diseases.

RESULTS. Risk factors for IA, such as underlying malignancy, neutropenia, steroid
use, admission to an intensive care unit, and the presence of graft-versus-host
disease, were comparable among the study drug group in the primary or salvage
setting. Likewise, comparable distribution of types of Aspergillus species and the
presence of disseminated IA were observed. Response to primary or salvage therapy was equally poor in both drug study groups regardless of treatment modality
(range, 7.7–15.8% response). In the primary therapy group, ABLC was associated
with significantly higher nephrotoxicity than L-AMB (P < .001).

CONCLUSIONS. Among patients with HM, primary therapy and salvage therapy
for IA with either ABLC or L-AMB as single agent were associated equally with
poor outcome. L-AMB appeared to be less nephrotoxic in the primary therapy
setting. Cancer 2008;112:1282–7.  2008 American Cancer Society.

nvasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancy.1–4 This infection
continues to be associated with high mortality that exceeds 50% despite the introduction of novel antifungal agents, such as echinocandins and the new triazoles.5–7
Over the past 3 decades, conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B (AMB) has been considered the gold standard of antifungal
therapy. However, the high incidence of side effects (eg, renal toxicity, electrolyte disturbances) associated with its uses has resulted in
the widespread use of less toxic lipid formulations of AMB, such as

AMB lipid complex (ABLC) or liposomal AMB (LAMB).8–10 Because there are limited data comparing
the efficacy and the safety of these 2 agents against
IA, we conducted the current study to compare the
efficacy and safety of ABLC with the efficacy and
safety of L-AMB used as either primary or salvage
therapy in patients with hematologic malignancy
(HM) and IA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Characteristics
We retrospectively evaluated 381 consecutive patients
with HM who had proven or probable IA between
June 1993 and December 2005.Clinical data pertaining to the following variables were obtained regarding all patients: sex, age, underlying malignancy,
history of transplantation within 1 year before the
onset of IA, presence of graft-versus-host disease,
neutropenia, duration of neutropenia during antifungal therapy, steroid use, admission to an intensive
care unit, and the use of mechanical ventilation. Further information also was obtained during antifungal
therapy pertaining to the type of IA (eg, pulmonary,
disseminated, etc), its clinical manifestation, history
of antifungal prophylaxis, duration of therapy daily
dose and side effects, and concomitant use of
adjunct therapy (eg, white blood cell transfusions,
hematopoietic growth factors [eg, granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor], and g interferon).
Definitions
In each patient IA was defined as either proven or
probable according to the guidelines published by
the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer and the Mycosis Study Group of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.11 Breakthrough IA was defined as infection in
a patient who was receiving systemic, prophylactic
antifungal agents with known activity against Aspergillus species for >7 days. Neutropenia was defined
as <500 neutrophils/mm3. A high antifungal dose
was defined as the receipt of 7.5 mg/kg per day of
intravenous L-AMB or ABLC. Response was defined
as the resolution of or a major improvement in the
signs and symptoms of IA (including radiologic
changes on chest x-rays or computed tomography
scans) and as the requirement of no further systemic
antifungal therapy in the judgment of the treating
physician. Failure was defined as the progression of
disease or the lack of significant improvement of
these same parameters, including death the of the
patient, drug withdrawal with evidence of ongoing
infection after 7 days of antifungal therapy, and the

1283

onset of toxicity that would require discontinuation
of the drug.
Adverse events (AE), which were categorized as
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy, were evaluated with regard to their drug-relatedness and were defined as follows: Unrelated AEs
definitely had an etiology other than the study drug.
Possibly related AEs had a timely relation to the study
drug, although a potential alternative etiology may
have been responsible for the AEs. Probably related
AEs had a timely relation to the study drug with no
other apparent etiology. Definitely related AEs had a
timely relation to the study drug and resolved when
the drug was discontinued.
Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in
creatinine of 2 times baseline. Hepatotoxicity was
defined as a 3-fold increase in either bilirubin and
transaminase or alkaline phosphatase and transaminase compared with baseline.

Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables, which are presented as ratios
or percentages, were compared using chi-square or
Fisher exact tests. Continuous variables, such as age
and duration of therapy, were compared using the
Student t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. If the
distribution of a continuous variable departed significantly from normality, then we repeated the comparison using a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum
test. A P value .05 represented a statistically significant result. Data analyses were performed using
SPSS software (version 12.00; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics
L-AMB or ABLC was administered to 158 patients as
primary therapy (Table 1). Among the patients who
received either drug as primary therapy, 52 patients
received ABLC, and 106 patients received L-AMB.
Most risk factors and clinical characteristics of IA
were comparable between both study drug groups
(Table 1). Patients in the ABLC group tended to have
more disseminated infection (P 5 .07).
An analysis of the salvage regimens established
that 30 patients received ABLC, and 51 patients
received L-AMB (Table 2). All variables were comparable between these 2 study drug groups (Table 2).
Treatment and Clinical Outcome
In the primary or salvage setting, the duration of
therapy with either lipid formulation of AMB was
similar. The doses of ABLC or L-AMB used were
between 5 mg/kg per day and 10 mg/kg per day. It is

drug study groups was 11.8% and 12.3% for ABLC and
L-AMB, respectively (Table 2). Response rates were
comparable between patients who received high doses
(7.5 mg/kg per day) and patients who received lower
doses of each drugs (L-AMB or ABLC) as either
primary or salvage antifungal therapy. Among the
patients who died during their hospitalization, mortality related to IA was high in both study groups (72%–
74% in the primary therapy group; 73%–89% in the

dose ABLC had an AE compared with an AE rate of
11% among the patients who received low-dose ABLC
(P 5 .49). It is important to keep in mind that the
treating physicians may have chosen low doses for
their patients because of ongoing renal or hepatic
symptoms. For the patients receiving salvage therapy,
whether they received L-AMB or ABLC, there were no
differences in outcome; however, high-dose use produced a higher AE rate than low-dose use (L-AMB:
35% vs 18%; P 5 .19; ABLC: 39% vs 17%; P 5 .25);
although the differences were not statistically significant, which may be because of the small size of the
population.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare
the safety and efficacy of ABLC with those of L-AMB
for the treatment of probable and proven IA in

patients with HM. Fleming et al. compared these 2
drugs in the treatment of all fungal infections.12
Those authors reported a better response rate than
in the current series. However, their study included a
large number of patients with invasive candidiasis,
an infection that usually is associated with a better
outcome than IA. In our study, the overall response
rate in patients with documented or probable IA
was approximately 8%. This is in contrast to other
studies, in which the response rate to presumed or
documented fungal infection ranged from 30% to
65%.9,13–17 One possible explanation for the differences between our findings and those from other
studies may be their use of empiric antifungal therapy for all fungal infections, including candidiasis.9,13,17 Another explanation for the worse outcome
in our study is that the patients in the current study
received highly cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents,
which led to a high rate of persistent neutropenia
(approximately 25%) along with the finding that the
majority of the patients in our study either had
advanced-stage HM or were critically ill (eg, they
required admission to an intensive care unit).
Furthermore, the population described in the current
report is not typical of the hematologic cancer population with aspergillosis. Indeed, the mortality rate
(>75%) is extremely high compared with other studies. This is reflected by the finding that nearly 50%
of our population was in the intensive care unit, and
35% required mechanical ventilation for >10 days. In
addition, patients with disseminated disease usually
have a worse outcome, which was true in our study.
A similarly low response rate was observed in the
largest prospective, randomized study by Herbrecht
et al.5 comparing voriconazole with AMB as primary
therapy for IA. The response rate observed in that
group of AMB-treated patients who had a prior history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) was 13.3%, which was comparable to the
response rate we observed in our patients with
advanced HM, who had an HSCT rate of nearly 40%.

With regard to toxicity, it is well known from
previous reports that renal toxicity is less common
in patients who receive lipid formulations of AMB
compared with patients who receive AMB deoxycholate.10,18,19 However, in our study, particularly
with L-AMB, nephrotoxicity was significantly more
common in the group that received ABLC as primary therapy compared with the group that
received L-AMB as primary therapy. Similarly, Wingard et al.20 reported that the use of L-AMB was
associated significantly with lower rates of nephrotoxicity. However, there was no difference in
nephrotoxicity in their salvage therapy group,
because this group was a different patient population with IA. These patients had advanced stages of
underlying disease and received variable concomitant medications, including nephrotoxic or nonnephrotoxic drugs.
Conversely, hepatotoxicity was not common, as
reported in the literature, and varied between 24%
and 59%.21,22 Although other studies have reported
more liver toxicity associated with the use of LAMB, in our study, there was no significant difference between the drug study groups in that
received primary or salvage therapy. AEs related
to infusion were not available because of the
retrospective nature of this study. However, these
are not common reactions and can be controlled
easily, as demonstrated in previous prospective
studies.18,22,23
Moreover, for the subset of patients who received
high-dose antifungal therapy in our study, unlike the
2 limited reports by Kontoyiannis et al.24 and Walsh
et al.,25 high-dose therapy did not produce a benefit
either in the primary therapy group or in the salvage
therapy group, whereas AEs were more common in
the high-dose salvage group but did not reach statistical significance. It is worth noting that, in all
groups, whether patients received high doses or low
doses of either ABLC or L-AMB, monotherapy was
associated with a low success rate (<16%) in our
patients with HM and IA. This low response rate is
consistent with the study by Herbrecht et al.,5 who
reported response rates to AMB deoxycholate as low
as 13% in an immunosuppressed population. These
data suggest that all derivatives of AMB preparation,
when given alone, were suboptimal as a therapeutic
choice in this patient population; and the addition
of caspofunging to L-AMB was not beneficial, as
reported by Kontoyiannis et al.26 from our institution.
Good alternative agents, such as voriconazole,
posaconazole, or the echinocandins, used alone or
in combination should be tested in our patient
population.

A recent study by Herbrecht et al. demonstrated
that voriconazole alone as primary therapy for IA
was associated with an overall response rate of
approximately 53%.5 In addition, in another study,
Walsh et al. reported that posaconazole alone also
produced promising outcomes as an alternative
to salvage therapy for patients with IA who were
refractory to or intolerant of previous antifungal
therapy.27 Furthermore, combination therapy for IA
with triazoles and echinocandins holds promises
because of their differing mechanisms of action.28,29
Marr et al.29 performed a retrospective evaluation of
patients with IA who received either voriconazole (31
patients) or a combination of voriconazole plus caspofungin (as salvage therapy in 16 patients). In their
multivariate analysis, salvage therapy with the combination was associated with a statistically significant
improvement in the 3-month survival rate compared
with voriconazole alone. These findings suggest that
the combination of antifungal therapy may produce
better outcomes.28,29 In addition, in a multicenter,
noncomparative study, Maertens et al. demonstrated
that caspofungin in combination with a triazole was
an effective alternative as salvage therapy for patients
with IA.30
The current study had several limitations including, its retrospective nature and the relatively small
number of patients. The response data should be
viewed with caution, because the choice of duration
of therapy was not controlled but was determined
according to the discretion of each treating physician. In addition, the evaluation of toxicity, especially
infusion-related toxicity, was done within the limitations of the retrospective nature of the study.
In summary, the current study demonstrated
that efficacy was comparable for both formulations
of AMB in the treatment of IA. L-AMB appeared to
be less nephrotoxic in the primary therapy setting.
However, the lipid formulation of AMB as a single
agent appeared to be suboptimal. This may have
been caused in part by the severity of underlying disease in our selected patient population. Hence, other
novel antifungal agents should be tested as monotherapy or in combination and may provide better
treatment choices against life-threatening IA in
patients with HM.
