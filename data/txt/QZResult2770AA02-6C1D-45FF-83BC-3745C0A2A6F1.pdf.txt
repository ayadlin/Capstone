ABSTRACT
Tefinostat (CHR-2845) is a novel monocyte/macrophage-targeted histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor which is cleaved into its active acid by the intracellular
esterase human carboxylesterase-1 (hCE-1). The in vitro efficacy of tefinostat was
characterised in cell lines and in a cohort of 73 primary AML and CMML samples.
Dose-dependent induction of apoptosis and significant growth inhibitory effects were
seen in myelomonocytic (M4), monocytic/monoblastic (M5) and CMML samples in
comparison to non-monocytoid AML sub-types (p = 0.007). Importantly, no growth
inhibitory effects were seen in normal bone marrow CD34+ cells exposed to AML-toxic
doses of tefinostat in clonogenic assays. Expression of hCE-1 was measured by
intracellular flow cytometry and immunoblotting across the cohort, with highest
levels seen in M5 AML patients. hCE-1 levels correlated with significantly increased
tefinostat sensitivity (low EC50) as measured by growth inhibition assays (p = 0.001)
and concomitant elevation of the mature monocytoid marker CD14+. Strong induction
of intracellular histone protein acetylation was observed in tefinostat-responsive
samples, as were high levels of the DNA damage sensor γ-H2A.X, highlighting
potential biomarkers of patient responsiveness. Synergistic interaction between
tefinostat and the current standard treatment cytarabine was demonstrated in dose
response and clonogenic assays using simultaneous drug addition in primary samples
(median Combination Index value = 0.51). These data provide a strong rationale for
the further clinical evaluation of tefinostat in monocytoid-lineage haematological
neoplasms including CMML and monocyte-lineage AMLs.

INTRODUCTION

a neoplasm that is classified within the WHO subcategorisation of ‘myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative
neoplasms’ [2] that has a high median age of presentation
(70–75 years), a median survival of only 11–17 months
and currently very limited treatment options [4, 5].
There is a pressing need to exploit advances made in
the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms that
underpin monocytoid malignancies by developing novel
therapeutic agents, applicable ideally to the treatment of
patients of all ages, that are able to effectively deliver
targeted effects to malignant cell populations while
avoiding significant systemic toxicity.
Histone acetylation is an important molecular
modification used to regulate gene transcription

Monocytoid-lineage leukaemias encompass the
monocytoid subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
(acute myelomonocytic leukaemia [previously FAB
type M4] and acute monoblastic/monocytic leukaemia
[M5]), as well as chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia
(CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia
(JMML) [1, 2]. Although the overall prognosis of AML
has improved gradually over the last 40 years, the majority
of patients continue to succumb to the disease with clinical
prospects remaining particularly bleak for older patients;
there has been little change to standard chemotherapeutic
treatment approaches over this time [3]. CMML is

that affects many cellular processes including cell
proliferation, differentiation, DNA repair, cell survival
and angiogenesis [6–8]. Histone deacetylases (HDACs)
are a family of epigenetic modifiers that alter chromatin
structure by removing lysine acetylation from histones,
resulting in a transcriptionally-closed state and subsequent
gene silencing or loss of expression. Alterations in
epigenetic programming have been commonly reported in
the initiation, progression and maintenance of cancer; and
aberrant localization of HDACs and resultant promoter
silencing has been implicated in several malignancies [7, 9]
including AML and the myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) [10–12] and has been reported in connection with
common oncogenic fusion proteins such as AML1ETO
(t8:21), and Inv16 (core binding protein) abnormalities
[13]. Myelomonocytoid and monocytoid / monoblastic
AML (FAB M4 and M5) accounts for approximately 25%
of total AML cases [44]; these cases have a distinct clinical
profile with frequent extramedullary manifestations
and leucocytosis along with emerging associations with
abnormalities in epigenetic regulation in the form of
DNMT3A mutations [45, 46].
Given the reversible nature of acetylation
modifications, therapeutic targeting of HDACs has
been an active area of drug development with the
promise of correcting the effects of aberrant gene
expression [14]. HDAC inhibitors may exert their
activity by multiple mechanisms of action including: cell
differentiation, DNA repair inhibition [15], induction
of reactive oxygen species [16], and replication
stalling [17]. Clinical trials of several HDAC inhibitors
including valproic acid, vorinostat, romidepsin,
belinostat and panabinostat have been conducted in
both solid tumours and haematological malignancies
including AML, MDS and CMML patients [18–22].
In general, reported clinical responses to single-agent
HDAC inhibitory therapy have been modest with dose
escalation of HDAC inhibitors being limited by a
relatively restricted therapeutic window. Off-target effects
of HDAC inhibition have been associated with significant
systemic toxicities including gastrointestinal disturbances,
thrombocytopenia, fatigue and insomnia which have
limited the wider clinical uptake of these agents. It is
highly desirable to develop mechanisms through which
HDAC inhibitory activity can be more-selectively
concentrated within tumour cells while sparing non-disease
cell populations.
Tefinostat (CHR-2845) is a novel pan HDAC
inhibitor which is cleaved to an active acid, CHR-2847,
by the intracellular esterase human carboxylesterase-1
(hCE-1), the expression of which is limited to cells of
monocytoid lineage and some hepatocytes, allowing
selective accumulation of active drug within monocytoid
cells. [23]. A phase I dose escalation study of tefinostat
in patients with relapsed/refractory haematological
malignancies demonstrated early signs of clinical efficacy
without any dose limiting toxicity. [23].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We examined the pre-clinical activity of tefinostat
in a large cohort of primary AML and CMML patient
samples in order to assess lineage specific activity,
potential therapeutic window and combination studies
with Cytarabine to build a rationale for future therapeutic
evaluation in monocytoid leukaemias.

RESULTS
Monocytoid leukaemias show selective high
sensitivity to tefinostat
The in vitro efficacy of tefinostat was first assessed
by MTS cell viability assay in AML cell lines HL60
(M2 FAB type), MV411 (M4, FLT3-ITD), OCIAML3
(M4 NPM1mut) and THP1 (M5) (EC50 = 2300 nM +/−226
vs. 57 nM +/−6.2 vs. 110 nM +/− vs. 560 nM +/−17.12
respectively, Figure 1A). Annexin V/PI incorporation
showed strong apoptotic induction in myelo-monocytic
cell lines THP1, MV411 (FLT3-ITD) and OCIAML3
within 24 hours of tefinostat treatment that was only
reached in non-monocytic HL60 cells at much higher
drug concentrations (Figure 1B–1C). Dose response to
tefinostat was assessed in a cohort of 66 primary AML
and 7 primary CMML samples (Ave EC50 2.7 µM +/− 3.1).
Significant growth inhibitory effects were seen in M4
(myelomonocytic)/M5 (monocytic / monoblastic) AMLs
and CMML samples with lower EC50s in comparison
to non-M4/M5 AML FAB types (mean EC50 M4/M5
= 1.1 µM +/−1.8, CMML = 1.9 +/−1.6 vs. M0/M1 = 5.1 µM
+/−4.7 respectively, *p = 0.009 spearman’s correlation,
Figure 1D). This selectivity between M0/M1 and M4/M5
FAB groups was abolished when the t-butyl tefinostat
analogue CHR-8185 (which is not cleaved by hCE-1) was
substituted as an alternative HDACi, further supporting
the monocytoid selectivity of tefinostat. M2 FAB type
AMLs displayed a wide range of sensitivity of response
to tefinostat; overall responses of M2 samples were not
significantly different from the M4/M5 sub-groups.
Importantly, there was no differential response between
tefinostat and CHR8185 in the M2 subgroup, suggesting
responses to be non hCE-1 mediated in this group
(Figure 1D).
Further analysis of the relationship between in vitro
tefinostat sensitivity (log10(EC50) and patient characteristics
revealed no significant differences in drug efficacy
according to other disease parameters including clinical
outcome, presenting cytogenetics and FLT3/NPM1
mutational status.(Supplementary Table S1).

blasts were highly sensitive to tefinostat treatment in
contrast to CD34+/CD14− AML blasts and CD45high
lymphocyte populations (Figure 2A). This sensitivity was
significantly reduced in when equivalent concentrations
of the non-hCE-1-dependent analogue CHR8185 were
used, demonstrating the myelo-monocytic specificity
of Tefinostat (Supplementary Figure S1). Importantly,
no growth inhibitory effects were seen in normal bone
marrow (NBM) CD34+ cells exposed to AML-toxic
doses of tefinostat while, in comparison, equivalent
concentrations of CHR-8185 caused considerable
cytotoxicity (Figure 2B). Exposure of NBM progenitor
cells to increasing concentrations of tefinostat in longerterm colony assays failed to reduce colony forming
units in comparison to vehicle-treated controls and AML
treated samples (pre-selected for high CD14+ percentage),
which showed significant reduction in colony formation
(Figure 2C, p < 0.02).

analysis by flow cytometry to look for differential effects
on intracellular acetylation. CD14-expressing cells showed
a maximum induction of intracellular protein acetylation
at nanomolar tefinostat concentrations after 6 hours of
drug exposure (Figure 4A). This analysis was extended
to compare tefinostat sensitive (n = 8, EC50 < 1 µM) and
resistant AML samples (n = 5, EC50 > 2.5 µM); significant
acetylation was induced at low nanomolar doses in low
EC50 samples, but was absent in those patients with
resistance to tefinostat (Figure 4B). Strong acetylation
induction was also observed in several CMML patient
samples (Figure 4C), although this appeared to be less
variable with Tefinostat sensitivity. Tefinostat-sensitive
samples also showed strong phosphorylation induction of
the cell cycle arrest and DNA double strand break damage
sensor protein γ-H2A.X, which is associated with DNA
cleavage during apoptosis. Induction was seen within
24 hours of drug treatment (Figure 4D–4E); suggesting
γ-H2A.X may be a potential future biomarker of patient
responsiveness to this drug.

hCE-1 expression levels dictate efficacy of
tefinostat in monocytic leukaemias

Tefinostat is synergistic with cytarabine

hCE-1 expression in primary samples was quantified
by intracellular flow cytometry in combination with
cell surface markers CD14, CD64 and CD45 to allow
identification of hCE-1 levels in different cellular subpopulations (Supplementary Figure S2). Significant
correlation was seen between levels of the mature
monocytic marker CD14+ and hCE-1 expression in
AML samples (Figure 3A). Further analysis of a larger
cohort of 40 primary AMLs and 7 CMMLs by western
blot confirmed highest hCE-1 levels in myelomonocytic
and monocytic FAB types, with M5 AMLs displaying
significant overexpression in comparison to NBM
levels (Figure 3B–3C, p = 0.01). This observation was
validated by microarray analysis of hCE-1 mRNA in a
further 130 AML samples, with M4/M5 AMLs showing
significant overexpression compared to NBM CD34+ cells
(Supplementary Figure S3). High hCE-1 levels was
associated with low EC50 values to tefinostat across
the cohort as measured by western blotting (Figure 3D
p < 0.001). To supplement western blot expression levels,
intracellular flow analysis of hCE-1 in a smaller cohort of
M2, M4 and M5 monocytoid AML samples was divided
into tefinostat-sensitive primary AMLs (EC50 < 1 µM
Ave) and tefinostat-resistant samples (EC50 > 2.5 µM).
Significantly higher intracellular flow levels of hCE-1
were observed in tefinostat-sensitive AMLs compared to
resistant samples (Figure 3E p < 0.001).

To further inform clinical development of tefinostat
we investigated the synergistic potential between tefinostat
and the conventional cytotoxic agent cytosine arabinoside
(AraC) at a fixed ratio of 1:10 (Tefinostat:AraC). In vitro
synergy was demonstrated in combination experiments
with clinically-relevant concentrations of tefinostat and
cytarabine (AraC) firstly in MV411 cells (Figure 5A)
and then in primary AML blasts (Figure 5B, Mean AML
combination index (CI) = 0.51, n = 31 patient samples,
Mean CMML CI = 0.53, n = 6 samples, CI at 50% fraction
affected; values < 0.9 = synergistic, 0.9–1.2 additive,
> 1.2antagonistic)). This synergism was observed across
a range of drug effects (Figure 5C and Supplementary
Table 3). Sequential administration of AraC followed by
tefinostat did not increase synergistic effects beyond those
observed with simultaneous application of the two agents
(Figure 5D–5E); pre-treatment with tefinostat, however,
was found to antagonise the combination response.
Interestingly, tefinostat-responsive AMLs frequently
stimulated NFκB p65 levels, commonly associated with
drug resistance mechanisms, although these samples
showed good synergy in combination with AraC
(Supplementary Figure S4). Clonogenic assessment
of single and combination pulse-treated AML blasts at
an optimum ratio of 1:10 (Tefinostat: AraC) revealed a
significant reduction in colonies in combination assays
compared to with each agent used alone (p < 0.04).

Increases in intracellular acetylation and DNA
damage induction are biomarkers of tefinostat
efficacy

DISCUSSION
Although overall survival rates in AML have
improved gradually over the last four decades this has
been achieved largely through incremental improvements

In order to identify biomarkers of tefinostat
sensitivity in AML blasts we undertook sub-population

with very little change in standard chemotherapy strategies
over this time; minimal impact has been seen in clinical
outcomes for older patients who represent the majority
of newly-diagnosed cases. Similarly in CMML, a

disease with an even higher median age of presentation,
there is a considerable unmet need for non-toxic
therapeutic strategies that are capable of altering the
natural history of the disease. There is a strong pre-clinical
rationale for HDAC inhibition in haematological

malignancies, but systemic toxicities including
gastrointestinal disturbances, myelosuppression, fatigue
and insomnia have so far hindered the clinical update of
HDAC inhibitors.
Here we report a series of in vitro experiments in
which we confirm the monocytoid-lineage specificity
of tefinostat in leukaemic cells obtained from patients
with AML and CMML. We observed a dose-dependent
induction of apoptotic response in myelo-monocytic
cell types and a significantly greater drug sensitivity at
sub-micromolar concentrations in this group compared
to that seen in undifferentiated or non-monocytic patient
samples. Esterase Sensitive Motif-mediated targeting
of tefinostat and the resulting CHR-2847 accumulation
in these cell types resulted in a 3.5–6.5 fold increase in
anti-proliferative potency compared to the that seen using
the untargeted t-butyl tefinostat analogue CHR-8185, in
line with the previously-reported improved efficacy of
tefinostat in comparison with other ‘non-targeted’ HDAC
inhibitors such as vorinostat [23]. Lesser responses to
tefinostat were seen in undifferentiated AML patient
subgroups M0/M1; although sensitivity was observed in
occasional undifferentiated samples with inherent HDAC
inhibitor sensitivity this manifested as equal sensitivity
to tefinostat and CHR-8185. Similarly, responses in
M2 subtypes were variable and this correlated with
the diversity of cellular sub-populations and CD14+
expression seen within this group.
Although mechanisms of action of HDAC inhibitors
remain to be fully characterised, sensitivity to these agents
has been linked to the apoptotic capability of each cell
type. Differing combinations of apoptotic mediators, cell
cycle abnormalities and differentiation blocks between
patient samples make it difficult to predict cellular
outcome to HDAC inhibitor treatment, although previous
studies have shown that monocytic AML cell types such as
the M5 cell line THP1 have greater apoptotic sensitivity to
the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat than other non-monocytic
AML cell lines [24]; this has been potentially linked to
activity of Bcl-2 family members [25]. Previous studies of
the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat have shown induction of
growth arrest and increase in myeloid transcription factor
expression associated with differentiation in AML cells
[26]. We found, however, that tefinostat induces apoptosis
at sub- EC50 level doses, indicating a different mechanism
of action to that of panobinostat. Other potential
mechanisms of action include acetylation and degradation
of key chaperone molecules such as HSP90 [27] which
supports a multitude of leukaemic oncoproteins. We find
total HSP90 protein levels to be unaffected by tefinostat
exposure in primary AML cells (data not shown), although
this does not exclude the possibility of a functional change
in HSP90 activity.
High levels of hCE-1 expression were found to drive
a significant increase in tefinostat efficacy as measured by
growth inhibition assays (p = 0.001), and also strongly
correlated with expression of the mature monocytoid
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

marker CD14+. CD14+ is widely used to define a mature
monocytic cell type; we and others find, however, that
CD14 may also be low or absent from leukaemic
monocytes as part of the heterogeneity associated with
this disease [28]. We observed that whilst, in the majority
of patients, CD14 levels correlated with increased hCE-1
expression, this was not exclusive, particularly in M2
AMLs where, as previously reported, high hCE-1 levels
were occasionally observed in the absence of significant
CD14 expression [29].
Induction of intracellular H3/H4 histone acetylation
was observed in all tefinostat-responsive AML and
CMML patient samples in contrast to previous studies
where other agents such as entinostat, vorinostat and
panabinostat induced only modest levels of H3/H4
acetylation and monocytic populations were found to
be resistant to HDAC inhibitory treatment [23, 30, 31].
hCE-linked targeting of tefinostat appears to circumvent
this issue, with CD14+ monocytic AML sub-populations
and CMML patient samples, as expected, showing the
highest levels of drug response. Additionally, we observed
preservation of normal bone marrow CD34+ cells and
clonogenic function at AML-toxic doses of tefinostat in
contrast to other HDAC inhibitors used in similar studies
where significant increases in acetylation were observed
in normal CD34+ cells [32, 33]. This finding emphasises
the potential for limiting off-target systemic toxicities by
harnessing hCE-1-dependent HDAC inhibitory activity
in malignancies involving cells of monocytoid lineage
(AML-M4, AML-M5 and CMML).
As yet a strong correlation between hyperacetylation
and clinical response to HDAC inhibitors remains to
be fully established. HDAC inhibitory efficacy is also
reported to be dependent on accumulation of DNA damage
[15], replication stalling [17], and apoptotic induction
[34]. AML cases with leukaemia- associated fusion
proteins are DNA damage repair deficient and therefore
may be more resistant to HDAC inhibition [35]. We found
no association, however, between tefinostat sensitivity
and any patient characteristics such as cytogenetic
group. We demonstrated that tefinostat induces the DNA
damage marker γ-H2A.X in the majority of responsive
patient samples similarly to that reported for other HDAC
inhibitors such as vorinostat [36], suggesting that this may
be a potential biomarker of patient response. Our data
suggest that tefinostat induces both apoptosis and DNA
damage accumulation within 24 hours of treatment in a
majority of samples which may predict greater clinical
response to this HDAC inhibitor. HDAC inhibition has
also previously been demonstrated to signal pro-survival
pathway feedback in the form of hyperacetylation of
p65 NFκB signalling [37]; dual inhibition of HDAC and
NFκB may potentiate efficacy in AML [38]. We observed
a transient increase in NFκB p65 induction following
tefinostat treatment, although this did not appear to impair
γ-H2A.X or apoptotic induction in our sample cohort.

Another putative mechanism of action of HDAC
inhibitors in single and combination studies is that of
oxidative injury [16, 37, 39], This process is driven through
NOX-mediated ROS induction which has been shown by
our group to be constitutively active in myelomonocytic
AML subtypes [40], and which may, in part, contribute to
the greater efficacy of tefinostat in these patients. Although
HDACis have been previously reported to selectively
target FLT3 ITD-mutant proteins for degradation in AML
[41] and to enhance FLT3 inhibition in cell lines [42, 43],
we found no association between in vitro sensitivity to
tefinostat and FLT3-ITD mutation status in our primary
sample cohort (Supplementary Table S1).
As HDAC inhibition may result in a reduction of
cells in S-phase, concerns have arisen that combination
with traditional chemotherapeutic agents such as AraC
may be antagonistic and that sequential administration
may be required to optimise response [30, 37]. Our
combination studies suggested that simultaneous dosing
with tefinostat and AraC may be the most effective
therapeutic regime and clonogenic synergy assays suggest
this combination is also capable of targeting proliferative
subsets within monocytoid AMLs. Pre-dosing with AraC
did not significantly improve efficacy of the combination
studies and pre-treatment with tefinostat produced an
antagonistic response. Primary AML blasts demonstrated
consistently high degrees of synergy in all primary samples
tested (CI = 0.5, n = 36). This synergistic interaction with
AraC (a principal component of AML cytotoxic regimens
for many years) warrants further larger scale evaluation as
a prelude to formal clinical evaluation.
The effective in vitro targeting of HDAC inhibition
in monocytoid AML and CMML described above,
combined with encouraging early signs of clinical activity
(coupled to selective HDAC inhibition) in the absence
of tefinostat-related toxicity in the Ossenkoppele study,
provides a compelling case for further clinical evaluation
of tefinostat in larger studies in monocytoid-lineage
leukaemias. Rapid identification of suitable ‘monocytoid’
patients at diagnosis will present some challenges for trial
design and will place an emphasis on close interactions
between laboratory and clinic. Of the two CMML patients
treated in the phase I study, one achieved a bone marrow
complete response (CR) at relatively small doses and
moving forward MONOCLE, a single- arm phase 2 study
of tefinostat monotherapy in CMML (EudraCT 2015002281-23) is shortly to commence recruitment at sites
within the UK.

(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. CMML samples were
obtained with informed consent under the MDSBio
Sample Collection Study (Ethics Reference Number 06/
Q1606/110). Mononuclear cells were purified by Ficoll
density gradient followed by CD45 staining (AML
samples with < 70% blast content following purification
were excluded from further analysis). AML/CMML cells
were cultured in IMDM (Sigma) with 10% FCS (Biosera).
Normal bone marrow MNCs were purchased from Lonza
and CD34+ cells were isolated using MiniMACS CD34
columns (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. HL60, MV411, OCIAML3 and THP-1
cell lines were cultured as recommended by ATCCLGC
(http://www.lgcstandardsatcc.org). All cultures were
incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. Tefinostat (CHR-2845) and
its N-butyl analogue control CHR8185 were supplied by
Chroma Therapeutics (Abingdon, UK). Cytarabine was
obtained from Sigma.

Western blot analysis
Sample preparation of lysates and western blotting
was performed as previously described [47]. Blots were
probed with: γ-H2A.X Ser139 (Cell Signalling), hCE-1
(Lifespan biosciences). Equal loading was confirmed by
Actin (Abcam). Quantification of proteins was carried out
using AIDA image analyser v4.22 (Raytest, Straubenhardt,
Germany).

Drug response and cell viability assays
In vitro cell survival/drug response assays were
set up with serial dilution of drugs in 96 well plates with
8 × 104 cells per well. Cell viability was assessed by Cell
Titre 96 Aqueous One MTS reagent (Promega) at 48 Hrs
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples with
less than 70% viability at 48 hours in untreated samples
were excluded from analysis. For cytosine arabinoside
(AraC) synergy experiments, dose response assays were
set up in triplicate for single and fixed ratio combination
treated AML cell lines and primary samples using
clinically-relevant AraC concentrations. For sequential
drug dosing cells were pre-treated for 24 Hrs with either
Tefinostat or AraC prior to addition of the second drug.
For sub-population analysis of drug response assays,
cells were harvested after 48 h, surface stained with
anti-CD45, CD14, CD64 and resuspended in 1 µg/ml
7aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) to determine viable cells
remaining by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur®
cytometer (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Triplicates
were averaged and dose response curves inputted to
Calcusyn to generate EC50 and combination index values
(Calcusyn v2.0 software,Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
Annexin V positivity was measured using the Annexin
V Apoptosis Detection Kit (eBioscience, Hatford, UK)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

METHODS
Cell culture reagents and patient samples
AML samples were collected with informed consent
from newly-diagnosed patients entering UK NCRI
AML15, 16 and 17 studies (Ethics Reference Numbers

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Cells were prestained for 20 min with surface
markers CD14, CD64, CD45 (BD Biosciences), then fixed
in phosflow lyse buffer (BD biosciences) for 10 mins at
37°C before washing (PBS/0.5%BSA/0.1 NaAzide) and
permeabilising in phosflow permeabilisation buffer II
(BD biosciences) for 30 mins on ice. Primary antibodies
were added for 45 mins at room temperature (RT)
anti-hCE-1 (Lifespan biosciences LS-105283) or
IgG control (Novous biological NB810-56910). For
assessment of modulation of intracellular acetylation, cells
were pre- incubated for 6 hours with Tefinostat prior to
surface staining and fixation. Primary antibody Ac-k-103
(Cell signaling #9681) and IgG control (Mouse IgG2a
×0943 DAKO) were used at 200 ng/ml. Finally, cells
were washed twice and incubated for 45 mins at RT with
PE conjugated secondary antibodies goat-anti-rabbit or
goat-anti-mouse (hCE-1 and Ak-k-103 respectively) prior
to FACS analysis.
