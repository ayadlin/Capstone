Abstract
VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2 or kinase insert domain receptor; KDR) is a known endothelial target
also expressed in NSCLC tumor cells. We investigated the association between alterations in the KDR
gene and clinical outcome in patients with resected non–small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC; n ¼ 248).
KDR copy number gains (CNG), measured by quantitative PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
were detected in 32% of tumors and associated with significantly higher KDR protein and higher
microvessel density than tumors without CNGs. KDR CNGs were also associated with significantly
increased risk of death (HR ¼ 5.16; P ¼ 0.003) in patients receiving adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, but no differences were observed in patients not receiving adjuvant therapy. To investigate
potential mechanisms for these associations, we assessed NSCLC cell lines and found that KDR CNGs
were significantly associated with in vitro resistance to platinum chemotherapy as well as increased levels
of nuclear hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) in both NSCLC tumor specimens and cell lines.
Furthermore, KDR knockdown experiments using small interfering RNA reduced platinum resistance,
cell migration, and HIF-1a levels in cells bearing KDR CNGs, providing evidence for direct involvement of
KDR. No KDR mutations were detected in exons 7, 11, and 21 by PCR-based sequencing; however, two
variant single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes were associated with favorable overall survival in
adenocarcinoma patients. Our findings suggest that tumor cell KDR CNGs may promote a more
malignant phenotype including increased chemoresistance, angiogenesis, and HIF-1a levels, and that
KDR CNGs may be a useful biomarker for identifying patients at high risk for recurrence after adjuvant
therapy, a group that may benefit from VEGFR-2 blockade. Cancer Res; 71(16); 5512–21. 2011 AACR.

Tumor growth is critically dependent on neovascularization
(1). The ligand VEGF is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen
known to be a highly potent and specific mediator of angiogenesis, and has 2 identified tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGF
receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2 or
kinase insert domain receptor; KDR; refs. 2–5). The VEGFR2 coded by the gene KDR (located in 4q12) is the predominant
mediator of VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell functions,
including cell migration, proliferation, survival, and enhancement of vascular permeability (6, 7). VEGFR-2 exhibits
robust protein tyrosine kinase activity in response to the
VEGF ligand (3).
In human epithelial tumors, including lung, VEGFR-2 has
shown to be expressed in malignant cells as well as in the
endothelial cell of tumor vasculature (8–11). In non–smallcell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), VEGFR-2 has been found to be
overexpressed in malignant cells of tumor tissues, and

KDR Abnormalities in NSCLC

associated with a poor outcome (8–12). The mechanism and
biological impact of VEGFR-2 overexpression of NSCLC cells,
however, is not known. Recent work from our group and
others has shown that tumor cell expression of VEGFR-1
may drive tumor cell invasiveness (13, 14) and promote
hypoxia-independent upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), but it is not known whether VEGFR-2
signaling directly impacts the tumor cell phenotype in
NSCLC.
Recently, a relatively high frequency (9%) of mutation and
amplification of KDR has been detected in lung adenocarcinoma histology (15); however, the presence of these abnormalities in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung is unknown. In
addition, there is no data available on the correlation of KDR
abnormalities with tumor and patients’ characteristics in lung
cancer, including outcome and response to therapy.
The objective of this study was to characterize the molecular abnormalities of VEGFR-2 in epithelial malignant cells of
NSCLC major histology types, adenocarcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma, and correlate with patients’ clinical characteristics. We studied KDR copy number gain (CNG), mutation,
and genetic variations in malignant cells of surgically resected
NSCLC tumor tissues and correlated results with pathologic
features in NSCLC patients’ tumors and with their platinum
adjuvant treatments and outcomes. In addition, using a series
of NSCLC cell lines and tissue specimens, we investigated
molecular mechanisms associated with KDR CNG in resistance to platinum, particularly the potential role of HIF-1a, a
key regulator of angiogenesis in malignant tumors (16).

Materials and Methods
NSCLC tumor specimens
We obtained archived frozen and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from NSCLC patients who
were surgically resected with curative intent from the Lung
Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE)
tissue bank at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center (Houston, Texas). The tissue banking and the study
were approved by the Institutional Review Board. We randomly selected 248 NSCLC specimens (159 adenocarcinomas
and 89 squamous cell carcinomas) to test KDR abnormalities.
Detailed clinical and pathologic information of the cases is
presented in Supplementary Table S1.
KDR copy number analysis in tumor specimens
We utilized 2 methodologies to test KDR CNG in NSCLC
tumor specimens: real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To enrich for malignant cell content for qPCR analysis, tumor tissues were
manually microdissected from optimal cutting temperature
compound-embedded frozen tissue sections for subsequent
DNA extraction. Tumor DNA was extracted using Pico Pure
DNA Extraction Kit (Arcturus) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples with proportions of
microdissected tumor cell greater than 70% were qualified
for qPCR analysis. KDR gene copy number was detected by
qPCR using the ABI 7300 real time PCR system (Applied

www.aacrjournals.org

Biosystems). The primers used to amplify KDR were KFGACACACCCTCAGGCTCTTG and KR-ACTTTTCACCGCCTGTTCTC. Each PCR was carried out using Power SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) at 50 C for 2 minutes
and 95 C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles at 95 C for 15
seconds and 60 C for 1 minute. b-Actin was introduced as the
endogenous reference gene, and TaqMan Control Human
Genomic DNA (Applied Biosystems) was amplified as a standard control for calibration. All sample and standard DNA
reactions were set in triplicate to gauge reaction accuracy. The
target gene copy number was quantified using the comparative Ct method. Gene copy number of greater than 4 was
considered as CNG, as previously reported (17).
KDR copy number analysis in NSCLC malignant tumor cells
was also carried out using a dual-color FISH assay developed
by 1 of the coauthors (M.V-G.). The KDR probe was prepared
from the BAC clone RP11-21A18 obtained from CHORI. The
FISH assay was conducted as we have previously published
(18). Copy number analysis was done in approximately 50
nuclei per tumor in at least 4 areas. Greater than 2 gene copies
per cell on average were considered as CNG.
KDR copy number and VEGFR-2 and HIF-1a expression
analyses in cell lines
All NSCLC cell lines were authenticated by DNA fingerprinting. Whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
array profiling was carried out in 75 NSCLC cell lines using the
Illumina Human1M-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip (Illumina,
Inc.). Prior to analysis, SNP data were normalized to the
regional baseline copy number to account for aneuploidy.
For VEGFR-2 reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis
conducted in 63 NSCLC cell lines, protein lysate was collected
from subconfluent cultures after 24 hours growth in media
with 10% FBS and assayed by RPPA as previously described
(19, 20). Cisplatin and carboplatin sensitivity was determined
in triplicate by MTS (inner salt) assay for each cell line, and the
concentration required for 50% growth inhibition (IC50) was
determined. For HIF-1a expression analysis, the cells were
serum starved for 24 hours and stimulated with 50 ng/mL
VEGF-A (R&D Systems). Cells were incubated in normoxia,
and protein lysates were collected after 8 hours. HIF-1a ELISA
(R&D Systems) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (13).
Microvascular density, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1a
expression analyses in tumors
Histology sections were incubated with primary antibodies
against VEGFR-2 (dilution 1:50; Abcam) for 90 minutes, CD34
(dilution 1:100; Lab Vision) for 35 minutes, and HIF-1a (dilution 1:100; Novus Biologicals) for 65 minutes. Tissue sections
were then incubated with the secondary antibody (EnVision
Dual Linkþ; DAKO) for 30 minutes, after which diaminobenzidine chromogen was applied for 5 minutes.
Protein expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry using light microscopy with a 200 magnification by 2
observers (F.Y. and I.W.). Tissue samples were analyzed for
VEGFR-2 expression in the cytoplasm and membrane of
malignant cells and for HIF-1a in the nucleus. We used a

4-value intensity score (0, 1þ, 2þ, and 3þ) and the percentage
(0% to 100%) of the extent of reactivity. The final score was
obtained by multiplying the intensity and extent-of-reactivity
values (range, 0–300). Microvascular density (MVD) was
assessed by Ariol 2.0 Image System (Ariol, Genetix) using
the criteria of Weidner and colleagues (21).

(19/54, 35%) histologies (P ¼ 0.572). The range of increased
KDR copy numbers was from 4 to 11 gene copies. None of 15
normal tissue samples adjacent to the NSCLC tested showed
KDR CNG. To confirm KDR CNG results by qPCR, 20 tumor
specimens with KDR CNG by qPCR were examined by FISH.
KDR copy gains in the malignant cells were confirmed by FISH
in all 20 NSCLC specimens detected by qPCR (Fig. 1A).

siRNA transfection, platinum cytotoxicity, and cell
migration assays in cell lines
We transfected NSCLC cells with 3 KDR gene-specific siRNA
duplexes and control siRNA (OriGene Technology), at a final
concentration of 10 nmol/L using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To
verify the knockdown efficiency, mRNA and protein of transfected cells were collected for real-time reverse transcripatase
PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. The assessment of
in vitro resistance to cisplatin and carboplatin was determined
by the MTS assay. NSCLC cell lines were seeded in octuplicate
at a density of 2,000 per well in 96-well plates. The following
day, cells were treated with cisplatin and carboplatin at
various concentrations ranging from 0 to 120 mmol/L for
cisplatin and 0 to 200 mmol/L for carboplatin. After 72 hours
of drugs exposure, 20 mL of MTS solution were added per well.
Cells were incubated for 1 to 4 hours at 37 C and read at a
wavelength of 490 nm. The cell migration assay using NSCLC
cell lines was carried out as previously reported (13).

Correlation between KDR CNG and VEGFR-2 protein
expression and MVD
To assess the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of
VEGFR-2 in NSCLC malignant cells and the MVD (CD34) in
lung tumor tissue stroma, we selected 52 lung tumor specimens with whole histologic sections from FFPE tissues. Of
these, 26 cases had KDR CNG and 26 cases did not. VEGFR-2
protein expression was present both in the cytoplasm and
membrane of malignant cells as well as in vessel endothelial
cells (Fig. 1B).
Levels of VEGFR-2 expression in cytoplasm and in membrane were associated with KDR CNG in malignant cells of
NSCLC. Tumors with KDR CNG showed significantly higher
cytoplasmic (P ¼ 0.013) and membrane (P ¼ 0.009) VEGFR-2
protein expression in the malignant cells (Fig. 1C), and higher
MVD (P ¼ 0.018) and larger vessel areas (P ¼ 0.033) in the
tumor stroma than cases without KDR CNG (Fig. 2A and B).

KDR mutation and SNPs genotyping analyses
For KDR mutation and SNP genotyping analysis in NSCLC
cell lines, we examined exons 7, 11, 21, 26, 27, and 30, using
PCR-based sequencing and intron-based PCR primers as
detailed in the Supplementary Table S2.
Statistical analysis
Demographic and clinical information were compared by
using the c2 or Fisher exact tests for category variables, and
Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous
variables. The distributions of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier
method and compared between groups using the log-rank
test. Cox proportional hazard models were used for regression
analyses of survival data and conducted on OS defined as time
from surgery to death or last contact, and on RFS defined as
time from surgery to recurrence or last contact. Follow-up
time was censored at 5 years. For the correlation analysis of
KDR CNG in NSCLC cell lines using the whole genome SNP
arrays data with cisplatin sensitivity, we used the Wilcoxon
rank sum test. The NSCLC cell lines RPPA data were quantified using the SuperCurve method which detects changes in
protein level as previously reported (22).

Results
KDR gene CNG analysis
In epithelial malignant NSCLC cells microdissected from
tumor tissues, KDR CNG was detected in 45 (32%) of 139
tumors examined. Similar frequency of KDR CNG was found in
adenocarcinoma (26/85, 31%) and squamous cell carcinoma

Association between tumor KDR CNG, clinicopathologic
features, and clinical outcome
When we correlated KDR CNG with patients’ clinicopathologic features, we did not find correlation with tumor histology, smoking status, and tumor stage. In the multivariate
analysis after adjusting for stage and adjuvant therapy, KDR
CNG was associated with poor OS (HR ¼ 4.0; 95% CI: 1.76–9.07;
P ¼ 0.001) and shortened RFS (HR ¼ 1.83, 95% CI: 1.02–3.29; P
¼ 0.044) in 115 NSCLC patients who underwent surgical
resection. Strikingly, KDR CNG was associated with a significantly worse OS (HR ¼ 5.16, 95% CI: 1.75–15.2; P ¼ 0.003) in
NSCLC patients receiving platinum adjuvant therapy, but not
in patients without adjuvant therapy (P ¼ 0.349; Fig. 3 and
Table 1). These data suggest that KDR CNG in malignant cells
may represent a predictive marker of worse outcome in
patients with surgically resected NSCLC treated with platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
We also investigated and examined the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on KDR CNGs. The platinum neoadjuvanttreated tumors (33%, 8/24) had similar frequency of KDR
CNGs than cases without neoadjuvant therapy (32%, 37/115).
KDR CNG and VEGFR-2 protein levels and correlation
with platinum resistance in cell lines
The association detected between KDR CNG and worse
outcome in patients treated with platinum adjuvant therapy
prompted us to examine the correlation between KDR gain
and VEGFR-2 protein levels in NSCLC cell lines with in vitro
resistance to platinum drugs. KDR CNG was assessed by SNP
array analysis in 75 NSCLC cell lines. Cell lines with KDR copy
gains of 6 to 9 copies or 10 or more copies above the regional
baseline copy number were identified. Nineteen (25%) cell

in cell lines with 6 or more KDR copies showed significantly

Then, we correlated the expression of VEGFR-2 protein in a

line's sensitivity to cisplatin or carboplatin. We found that

utilized siRNA to knock down KDR expression in H23 and
H461 NSCLC cell lines, which contain 6 to 9 KDR gene copies,
and as control A549 NSCLC cell line with normal KDR copy
number. In both cell lines, siRNA targeting KDR significantly
decreased KDR mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR, and
VEGFR-2 expression by Western blot, compared with control
cells transfected with scrambled siRNA and nontransfected
cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 4C). The in vitro sensitivity of H23 and H461
cells to cisplatin (Fig. 4D) or carboplatin (data not shown)
treatment was increased in siKDR transfected cells compared
with control siRNA-transfected or untransfected cells, suggesting that VEGFR-2 is contributing to chemoresistance in
this model. This phenomenon was not observed in cell A549
with normal KDR copy number.
In addition, we found that knockdown of reduction of
VEGFR-2 expression induced by siKDR transfection significantly inhibited the migration of H23 and H461 cells compared with siRNA control-transfected or untransfected cells
(Fig. 4E and F).

gested that VEGFR-2 may be impacting the HIF-1a pathway,
which is known to impact each of these cellular properties (13,
14). To investigate this further, we evaluated HIF-1a levels by
ELISA in a panel of NSCLC cell lines with a range of KDR copy
numbers and expression of VEGFR-2. HIF-1a levels were higher
in cell lines with KDR CNG, and significantly (P ¼ 0.02) higher in
cells with 6 to 9 gene copies, compared with cells with no CNG
(Fig. 5A). In H23 cells which have KDR CNG, stimulation with 50
ng/mL VEGF-A for 8 hours induced a rise in HIF-1a expression.
Furthermore, knockdown of KDR with siRNA significantly (P ¼
0.01) reduced HIF-1a levels (Fig. 5B). This phenomenon was not
detected in cell lines A549 with normal KDR copy number. These
data indicated that VEGFR-2 can regulate HIF-1a in a liganddependent, but hypoxia-independent, manner in NSCLC cells.
We next investigated the potential association between KDR
CNG and HIF-1a in NSCLC clinical specimens. Similar to the
results in the NSCLC cell lines, tumor tissue specimens with
KDR CNG (n ¼ 25) showed a significantly (P ¼ 0.037) higher
expression of nuclear HIF-1a expression by immunohistochemistry than tumors without CNG (n ¼ 22; Fig. 5C and D).

than CNGs may impact NSCLC tumors, we assessed the KDR

Discussion
Our study represents the first report in lung cancer showing a
high frequency of KDR CNG (32%) in both major histology types
of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, by
qPCR and confirmed in a subset of cases by FISH. Notably, KDR
CNG predicted worse OS in patients who received platinum
adjuvant therapy but not in untreated patients. In NSCLC cell

lines, we found that KDR CNGs were significantly associated
with in vitro resistance to platinum chemotherapy, as well as
increased levels of nuclear HIF-1a. Furthermore, KDR knockdown experiments using siRNA reduced platinum resistance,
cell migration, and HIF-1a levels in cells bearing KDR CNGs,
providing evidence for direct involvement of KDR. Our findings
suggest that tumor cell KDR CNGs may promote a more
malignant phenotype including increased chemoresistance,
angiogenesis, and HIF-1a levels.
In our study, tumors with KDR CNG in the malignant cells
showed significantly higher VEGFR-2 protein expression in
the cytoplasm and membrane of those cells, as well as higher
MVD and larger vessel areas in the tumor stroma, compared

with tumors lacking the KDR CNG. One possible explanation
for this association is that tumor cell VEGFR-2 binds circulating VEGF, increasing local concentrations of the ligand which
in turn increases angiogenesis through effects on tumor
endothelium. Another possible explanation is that VEGFR-2
overexpressing lung cancer cells may express increased levels
of VEGF and other proangiogenic factors via upregulation of
HIF-1a, which in turn could promote autocrine or paracrine
signaling that further increases expression. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and merit further investigation. Our finding of correlations between KDR CNG and higher
expression of HIF-1a in NSCLC cell lines and tumor specimens support the latter hypothesis. It has been showed that
activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; RET,
VEGFR-1, epidermel growth factor receptor, and plateletderived growth factor receptor) increases HIF-1a levels in a
cell-specific manner in tumors (13, 23, 24); therefore, our data
represent the first evidence suggesting that VEGFR-2 may be
another RTK that plays a role in increasing the levels of HIF-1a
expression in cancer.
A provocative finding of this study is this first report that
KDR CNG in malignant cells predicted a worse outcome of
NSCLC patients receiving platinum adjuvant chemotherapy
after surgical resection with curative intent, but was not
predictive in patients without adjuvant therapy. These findings suggest that KDR CNG may represent a potential biomarker for predicting resistance to adjuvant platinum-based
chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. It is also noteworthy that
VEGFR-2 knockdown reduced chemoresistance and cell
migration, and lowered HIF-1a levels, using in vitro NSCLC
models. One potential implication of these findings is that
VEGFR-2 blockade may sensitize tumors bearing KDR CNGs
to chemotherapy directly through effects of the tumor cells
themselves, in addition to its effect on tumor endothelial cells.
KDR CNGs may therefore identify a group of NSCLC patients
that would receive greater relative benefit from combinations
of VEGF pathway inhibitors with chemotherapy than patients
lacking KDR CNGs. Further prospective studies with larger
patient cohorts are needed to assess the role of KDR CNG in
NSCLC tumors and outcome of NSCLC patients treated with
platinum-based chemotherapy in both surgically resected and
advanced metastatic tumor settings, and to determine
whether KDR CNGs are predictive of either chemoresistance
or benefit for VEGF inhibitor benefit/chemotherapy combinations compared with chemotherapy alone.
Our finding that KDR CNG by SNP array and higher levels of
VEGFR-2 expression by RPPA in a large series of NSCLC cell
lines correlated significantly with in vitro resistance to platinum dugs (cisplatin for KDR CNG, and cisplatin and carboplatin for VEGFR-2 expression) provides support to our
clinical observation. The increased sensitivity of the NSCLC

cell lines having KDR CNG to in vitro treatment with cisplatin
or carboplatin after inhibition of KDR mRNA and protein
expressions further supports the concept that KDR CNG may
promote platinum resistance in NSCLC. Although the exact
mechanism needs to be elucidated, we postulate that the
increased expression of HIF-1a induced by KDR CNG, and
subsequent VEGFR-2 expression, in malignant NSCLC cells
may explain increased platinum resistance in NSCLC. Interestingly, HIF-1a has been previously associated to chemoresistance in NSCLC (25, 26) and other solid tumor types (27, 28).
The finding that inhibition of KDR and VEGFR-2 expression
resulted in decreased NSCLC cell migration points out another
new interesting role of VEGFR-2 in NSCLC malignant cells. It
has been established that, among other functions, VEGFR-2 is
an important mediator of VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell
migration (29, 30). We have also observed that that HIF-1a
mediates migration driven by another RTK, EGFR, in NSCLC,
independent of hypoxia (31).
In our study, the variant genotypes of KDR SNPs 1416 (AT/
TT) and -37(AG/GG) associated with a favorable OS in the
multivariate analysis. Ours is the first report showing association between KDR SNP genotypes and prognosis in lung
cancer. In breast cancer patients, the KDR SNP 1416 A/T
genotypic variant was associated with the expression of
progesterone receptors, and its presence suggested a better
prognosis for carriers of the T allele (32). Questions remain
about the functional roles of the KDR SNPs responsible for the
associations with outcome of NSCLC patients, particularly in
adenocarcinoma patients, found in our study.
In summary, our findings indicate that KDR CNG was
frequently detected in NSCLC tumors and associated with
platinum resistance in vivo and in vitro, and may be a useful
biomarker for identifying patients at high risk for recurrence
after adjuvant therapy, a group that may benefit from VEGFR2 blockade.
