Abstract
Vascular endothelial cells have been identified as a critical
component of the neural stem cell niche, raising the
possibility that brain tumor stem-like cells (TSLC) may also
rely on signaling interactions with nearby tumor vasculature
to maintain their stem-like state. The disruption of such a
TSLC vascular niche by an antiangiogenic therapy could result
in loss of stemness characteristics associated with intrinsic
drug resistance and, thus, preferentially sensitize TSLC to the
effects of chemotherapy. Considering these possibilities, we
investigated the impact of antiangiogenic anticancer therapy
on the TSLC fraction of glioma tumors. Athymic nude mice
bearing s.c. tumor xenografts of the C6 rat glioma cell line
were treated with either a targeted antiangiogenic agent,
antiangiogenic schedules of low-dose metronomic chemotherapy, combination therapies of antiangiogenic agents and
chemotherapy, or, for the purpose of comparison, a conventional cytotoxic schedule of maximum tolerated dose chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide. Targeted antiangiogenic
therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy did not reduce the fraction
of tumor sphere-forming units (SFU) in the tumor, whereas
all treatment groups that combined both antiangiogenic and
cytotoxic drug effects caused a significant reduction in SFU.
This work highlights the possibility that selective eradication of
TSLC may be achieved by targeting the tumor microenvironment (and potentially a supportive TSLC niche) rather than the
TSLC directly. Furthermore, this work suggests a possible novel
effect of antiangiogenic therapy, namely, as a chemosensitizer
of TSLC, and thus represents a possible new mechanism
to explain the ability of antiangiogenic therapy to enhance
the efficacy of chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3560–4]

Introduction
Numerous studies indicate that the growth of gliomas (1–4), and
a number of other types of cancer (5), is initiated and driven by
a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem-like characteristics,
including self-renewal capacity and the ability to differentiate.
It has been postulated that, in addition to these hallmarks of
‘‘stemness,’’ tumor stem-like cells (TSLC) may also possess a
number of other properties associated with normal stem cells,
including a slow proliferation rate, active DNA damage repair and
antiapoptotic pathways, and the expression of multidrug trans-

porters on the plasma membrane (6). Indeed, it has been shown
that glioma cells exhibiting the side-population phenotype, which
is characterized by cellular exclusion of the dye Hoechst 33342
primarily attributed to the ABCG2 multidrug transporter, are
enriched with TSLC (4). Furthermore, CD133+ glioma stem-like
cells have been found to resist doses of radiation lethal to
surrounding non–stem-like cells in the tumor by preferential
activation of the DNA damage response (7). The retention of such
properties by TSLC suggests that, like normal stem cells, TSLC may
be inherently resistant to many traditional anticancer therapies
that target rapidly dividing cells. This represents a daunting
therapeutic challenge because the characterization of the TSLC as
the proliferative driving force in the tumor suggests that TSLC
must be eradicated to permanently or significantly arrest tumor
growth. As such, there is growing interest in developing therapeutic
strategies specifically aimed at eliminating or affecting the TSLC
population.
Given the demonstrated similarities between neural stem cells
and glioma TSLC, it stands to reason that glioma TSLC may also,
like neural stem cells, exist within a supportive niche. Through
contact-mediated and paracrine signaling interactions between
stem cells and the niche microenvironment, the niche maintains
and controls critical stem cell properties and functions (8). Soluble
factors secreted by vascular endothelial cells have been found
to promote self-renewal and inhibit differentiation of neural stem
cells, suggesting that neural stem cells have a vascular niche (9).
This finding raises the possibility that glioma TSLC may also rely
on interaction with a vascular niche to maintain their stem-like
properties, and consequently, their ability to drive tumor growth.
Indeed, a very recent study provides compelling evidence that brain
TSLC are supported by a vascular niche (10). Consistent with this
notion, many studies have found that proangiogenic growth factors
such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; refs. 1–4), epidermal
growth factor (EGF; refs. 1–3) and platelet-derived growth factor
(4), which would ostensibly be in higher concentration near blood
vessels, permit maintenance and expansion of glioma TSLC in
culture. Considering the possibility that glioma TSLC are maintained by a supportive vascular niche, we investigated whether
antiangiogenic therapies can reduce the TSLC fraction of glioma
tumors.

C6 glioma cells were grown as monolayers in either
DMEM + 10% FBS (Unconditioned media ), or DMEM +
10% FBS that had been incubated with subconfluent
HUVEC for 24 h (HUVEC conditioned media). Following
7 d of culture in either condition, C6 cells were trypsinized,
washed with PBS, and subjected to primary tumor sphereforming assay as described in Materials and Methods.
After 11 d, the number of spheres per well was enumerated

with 0.25% trypsin-0.03% EDTA (Invitrogen).
Generation of HUVEC conditioned media. Eighty percent confluent
14-cm dishes of HUVEC were washed with PBS and incubated in 12 mL
DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 h. Conditioned media was centrifuged 7 min at
1,000 rpm, and supernatant was filter sterilized (0.2-Am pore PES
membrane, Nalgene Nunc Int.).
Mice, rat tumor xenografts, and treatment regimens. Adult female
athymic nude mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were injected s.c. with 106
C6 cells in 200 AL serum-free DMEM, and the following treatments were
initiated 11 days later: low-dose metronomic (LDM) cyclophosphamide,
20 mg/kg/day p.o. via the drinking water, as described (11); maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) cyclophosphamide, 100 mg/kg i.p. on days 1, 3, and
5 of a 21-day cycle; DC101, a rat anti-mouse VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR)/
flk-1 monoclonal antibody (12), 800 Ag mouse i.p. every 3 days; combined
LDM cyclophosphamide + DC101; combined MTD cyclophosphamide +
DC101; or bolus + LDM cyclophosphamide, 100 mg/kg i.p. on day 1 and
20 mg/kg/day p.o. on days 3 to 21, of a 21-day cycle. Each group received
normal saline p.o. and i.p. corresponding to p.o. and i.p. cyclophosphamide doses, and PBS i.p. corresponding to DC101 doses, corresponding to
all treatment schedules which that group was not receiving. Tumors were
measured using Vernier calipers, calculating volume as: width2  length 
0.5. After 2 weeks of treatment, tumors were excised and weighed.
Sphere-forming assays. Cultures were trypsinized and strained through
a 40-Am sieve. Tumors were minced, digested in 4 mg/mL collagenase 3
(Worthington, Freehold, NJ), 2 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich,
Oakville, Ontario, Canada), and 2 mg/mL collagenase IV (Sigma) in
serum-free DMEM for 25 min at 37jC, strained through a 40-Am sieve,
incubated 5 min at room temperature in 0.75% NH4Cl to lyse RBC, and
washed with DMEM + 10% FBS. Single cell suspensions were confirmed
microscopically, washed with PBS, and suspended at 1,000 cells/mL in
serum-free DMEM supplemented as described (4). One hundred microliters
of the cell suspension was plated in each of the 30 wells of a 96-well
microplate (Nunc). Each well was fed 25 AL serum-free supplemented
DMEM every other day for 11 days ( from culture) or 14 days ( from tumor).
Spheres (tight, spherical, nonadherent masses >90 Am in diameter) per well
were counted, and at least 50 spheres per group were measured with an
ocular micrometer. For secondary sphere-forming assays, primary spheres
were dissociated mechanically and processed as in the primary assay.
Circulating endothelial progenitor cell analysis. Blood was collected
by retro-orbital bleed following treatment, and CEP levels were evaluated
using four-color flow cytometry as described (13).

Results
Factors secreted by endothelial cells enhance the capacity of
glioma cells to form tumor spheres in vitro. The C6 rat glioma
cell line, which is known to contain a subpopulation of TSLC (4),
was grown in either normal serum-containing media or HUVECconditioned serum-containing media. After 7 days, the cells in each
culture were subjected to an in vitro primary tumor sphere-forming
assay at clonal density (1,000 cells/mL). It has been shown in C6 (4)
and primary human glioma cultures (2, 3) that TSLC, but not non–
stem-like tumor cells, form primary tumor spheres in permissive
culture conditions. Furthermore, we have found that serum-free C6
cultures enriched in sphere-forming units (SFU; compared with
serum-containing C6 cultures) are also enriched in tumor initiating
cells, as determined by limiting dilution transplant into immunedeficient mice.4 We have also shown that the number of SFU within
primary C6 tumor spheres expands in a secondary sphere-forming
assay (see Fig. 4A and C), and prolonged passaging of C6 tumor
spheres has been found to selectively enrich the TSLC fraction (4).
Taken together, these observations indicate that C6 primary tumor
spheres are self-renewing, and that their incidence is correlated
with the presence of TSLC. Therefore, we used performance in the
primary sphere-forming assay as a surrogate readout of the TSLC
fraction in our in vitro cultures and in vivo tumors. C6 cultures
grown in HUVEC conditioned media formed significantly more
spheres (of similar size) compared with C6 grown in unconditioned
identical media (Fig. 1). This suggests that endothelial cells secrete
soluble factors that support and/or enhance the high proliferative
potential (and presumably, by extension, tumorigenic properties) of
glioma TSLC. Taken together with evidence in the literature that
human brain TSLC are maintained by a vascular niche (10), and
that C6 TSLC require angiogenic growth factors for maintenance
and expansion in culture (4), our finding supports the notion that a
vascular niche contributes to the maintenance and control of TSLC
function in the C6 glioma model.
Therapies combining antiangiogenic and tumor cell cytotoxic effects reduce the number of tumor sphere-forming cells
in glioma xenografts. To investigate the effects of antiangiogenic

therapies on the glioma TSLC fraction, we treated nude mice
bearing s.c. C6 tumor xenografts with several therapeutic strategies.
These included the mouse VEGFR2 targeting antibody DC101 (12),
daily LDM cyclophosphamide, which is thought to work in large
part by an antiangiogenic mechanism (14), and an alternative
schedule of LDM cyclophosphamide that includes an upfront
bolus dose of cyclophosphamide (bolus + LDM cyclophosphamide)
and also works by an antiangiogenic mechanism (15). For the
purpose of comparison, we also included a group treated with a
conventional cytotoxic MTD schedule of cyclophosphamide. In
addition, we included groups treated with a combination of DC101
with either LDM cyclophosphamide or MTD cyclophosphamide

were divided into seven treatment groups containing seven mice each, and
treatments were initiated. Mice were treated with either LDM cyclophosphamide

chemotherapy are frequently superior to either monotherapy.
Indeed, as monotherapies, antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab seem to have very limited therapeutic efficacy in the
treatment of advanced-stage cancers (16). After a delay period to
allow for tumor establishment, animals were treated for 14 days.
Tumor volumes were assessed periodically by caliper measurement
(Fig. 2A). Following the treatment period, tumors were harvested
and weighed (Fig. 2B). At the end of the treatment period, there
were no significant differences in mouse body mass between
treatment groups (data not shown). All therapies produced a
significant tumor growth delay. The levels of bone marrow–derived
circulating endothelial progenitor (CEP) cells in the peripheral
blood were measured by four-color flow-cytometric analysis of
blood collected following the treatment period (Fig. 3). We have
previously shown that suppression of peripheral blood CEP levels
can be used as a surrogate marker for the efficacy of antiangiogenic
therapy (17). Based on this assay, we find that all therapies tested
except for MTD cyclophosphamide, as expected, have an
antiangiogenic effect.
The TSLC fraction in treated tumors was assessed by primary
tumor sphere-forming assay of enzymatically dissociated tumors
harvested at the end of the treatment period (Fig. 4A and B). MTD
cyclophosphamide or DC101 had no effect on the fraction of SFU
within the tumor, whereas all other therapies significantly reduced
the SFU fraction (Fig. 4A). Several therapies caused a small but
significant increase in the size of primary tumor spheres, with
MTD cyclophosphamide producing the greatest increase in sphere
size (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, MTD cyclophosphamide was the only
treatment to cause an increase in sphere size without a concomitant decrease in SFU fraction. Primary tumor spheres were
dissociated, and secondary sphere-forming assays were done
(Fig. 4C and D). Sphere-forming capacity was increased in the
secondary compared with the primary assay across all groups,
suggesting that SFU in the tumor are capable of self-renewal and

expand in the culture conditions used for the assay. Intergroup
relationships of sphere-forming capacity observed in the primary
assay were generally maintained in the secondary assay, indicating
that certain therapies preferentially impact self-renewing tumor
cells.
MTD cyclophosphamide is generally considered to work
primarily via direct tumor cell cytotoxicity. Indeed, we find that
MTD cyclophosphamide results in a significant tumor growth delay
(Fig. 2) in the absence of any antiangiogenic effects as assessed by
the peripheral blood CEP assay (Fig. 3). DC101 is a rat monoclonal
antibody that blocks VEGF binding to the mouse VEGFR2 and,
therefore, produces a tumor growth delay strictly by inhibition of
angiogenesis. Our results with MTD cyclophosphamide and DC101
therefore indicate that neither inhibition of angiogenesis with a
targeted biological agent alone nor tumor cell cytotoxicity alone is
sufficient to reduce the TSLC fraction in the tumor. Although we
did not see an increase in SFU following MTD cyclophosphamide,
an outcome that has been predicted for tumors treated with
cytotoxic chemotherapy (6), the increased sphere diameter
resulting from MTD cyclophosphamide in the primary and

secondary assays may reflect selection for self-renewing tumor
cells with the highest proliferative capacity.
Although LDM cyclophosphamide was not as strongly antiangiogenic as DC101 (Fig. 3), both therapies produced a
comparable tumor growth delay (Fig. 2). This suggests that another
factor unrelated to the inhibition of angiogenesis contributes to the
efficacy of LDM cyclophosphamide. Given the mechanism of action
of cyclophosphamide (a DNA alkylating agent), the most plausible
explanation is that LDM cyclophosphamide, in addition to its
antiangiogenic effects, produces some tumor cell cytotoxic effects
as well in C6 xenograft tumors. Therefore, all treatment groups that
cause a reduction in tumor TSLC fraction, namely, LDM
cyclophosphamide, LDM cyclophosphamide + DC101, MTD
cyclophosphamide + DC101, and bolus dose + LDM cyclophosphamide, produce both antiangiogenic and tumor cell cytotoxic
effects. Notably, the addition of DC101 enhanced the TSLCreducing effects of LDM cyclophosphamide and conferred TSLCreducing ability to MTD cyclophosphamide, demonstrating that
angiogenesis inhibition plays a significant role in the observed
reductions in the TSLC fraction. The addition of a bolus

cyclophosphamide dose lessened the TSLC-reducing capacity of
LDM cyclophosphamide, and the combination of LDM cyclophosphamide + DC101 caused the most significant reduction in TSLC.
Taken together, these observations suggest that strong inhibition of
angiogenesis, in combination with frequent low-level cytotoxic
effects to tumor cells (as opposed to the strong cytotoxic effects
resulting from bolus cyclophosphamide doses), is optimal for
selective reduction of the TSLC fraction.

Discussion
A number of studies have shown that targeted antiangiogenic
agents and chemotherapy often have additive or synergistic effects
when used in combination. Indeed, in the clinic, antiangiogenic
drugs used as monotherapies have little, if any, discernible
therapeutic (survival) benefit in the treatment of advanced-stage
cancers and must be combined with chemotherapy to show such a
benefit (16). Several models have been proposed to explain the
apparent chemosensitizing effects of antiangiogenic therapy (16).
These models include ‘‘vessel normalization,’’ resulting in transient
drops in interstitial fluid pressure, increased blood flow, and
reduced hypoxia within tumors (18), slowing down tumor cell
repopulation between successive cycles of chemotherapy (19) and
facilitating the targeting of dividing endothelial cells in the tumor
vasculature and/or bone marrow–derived CEP cells (13–17). Our
current results suggest yet another possible way in which
antiangiogenic therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy may work
together in some cases, namely, by eliciting preferential eradication
of the TSLC fraction, as in our glioma model. Our results show that
whereas neither antiangiogenic nor tumor cell cytotoxic effects
alone are sufficient to reduce the TSLC fraction, therapies
combining these effects are capable of selectively eliminating
TSLC from the tumor. One possible explanation for these
observations is that antiangiogenic therapies disrupt a glioma
TSLC vascular niche. The subsequent loss in communication
between TSLC and their niche would elicit a reduction or loss of
certain stem cell characteristics, which could include aspects of
stem cell–associated drug resistance, and may result in, for
example, increased proliferation rate and reduced DNA repair
capacity in TSLC. Such changes would sensitize the TSLC to the

cytotoxic effects of cyclophosphamide, thereby allowing combinatorial therapies to selectively eliminate TSLC. This hypothesis
represents a novel model by which antiangiogenic therapy may
sensitize tumors to the effects of chemotherapy, providing further
rationale for the combination of these therapies in clinical
practice. It may also help explain why an antiangiogenic drug
such as bevacizumab may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy
for prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival in the
absence of a major increase in the tumor response rate (i.e., rapid
and significant tumor shrinkages; ref. 20) because the TSLC
population represents only a minor fraction of the overall tumor
mass. Furthermore, our data suggest that bolus cytotoxic doses of
chemotherapy may select for highly proliferative self-renewing
tumor cells, whereas, in contrast, frequent, low-dose schedules of
the same agent eliminate these cells, indicating that LDM
schedules of chemotherapy may be superior to MTD schedules
as the partner therapy to an antiangiogenic agent and for targeting
the TSLC population.
In addition to demonstrating a novel function of antiangiogenic
therapy, our data provide new insight into TSLC biology.
Specifically, we show that factors secreted by endothelial cells
increase the TSLC fraction in C6 cultures, and that inhibition of
angiogenesis plays a key role in the elimination of TSLC by
antiangiogenic plus cytotoxic therapy. These findings, consistent
with another recently published study (10), suggest that the
vascular microenvironment has a role in maintaining brain TSLC
identity and function. Furthermore, our work indicates that
targeting of a TSLC supportive niche microenvironment may be
a feasible strategy (or component of a strategy) for targeted
eradication of TSLC.
