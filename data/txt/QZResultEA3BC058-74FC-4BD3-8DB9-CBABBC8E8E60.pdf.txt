Abstract

Author Manuscript

SAG (Sensitive to Apoptosis Gene), also known as RBX2 or ROC2, is a RING protein required
for the activity of Cullin-RING ligase (CRL). Our recent study showed that Sag total knockout
caused embryonic lethality at E11.5–12.5 days with associated defects in vasculogenesis. Whether
Sag is required for de novo vasculogenesis in embryos and angiogenesis in tumors is totally
unknown. Here, we report that Sag endothelial deletion also causes embryonic lethality at E15.5
with poor vasculogenesis. Sag deletion in primary endothelial cells or knockdown in MS-1
endothelial cells inhibits migration, proliferation and tube formation with p27 accumulation being
responsible for the suppression of migration and proliferation. Furthermore, Sag deletion
significantly inhibits angiogenesis in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay, and tumor angiogenesis and
tumorigenesis in a B16F10 melanoma model. Finally, MLN4924, an investigational small
molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) that inhibits CRL, suppresses in vitro
migration, proliferation, and tube formation, as well as in vivo angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.
Taken together, our study, using both genetic and pharmaceutical approaches, demonstrates that
Sag is essential for embryonic vasculogenesis and tumor angiogenesis, and provides the proof-ofconcept evidence that targeting Sag E3 ubiquitin ligase may have clinical value for antiangiogenesis therapy of human cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

CRL (Cullin-RING ligase) is the multi-complex E3 ubiquitin ligase, consisting of four
components: an adaptor protein (e.g. SKP1), one of eight cullin family members (e.g.
Cul-1), a substrate recognizing receptor (e.g. F-box protein Skp2), and one of two RING
family proteins: RBX1/ROC1 and RBX2/ROC2, also known as SAG (Sensitive to
Apoptosis Gene). 1–3 While the receptor protein determines the substrate specificity, the
cullin-RING components constitute the core ubiquitin ligase activity. 3, 4 Activity of CRL
also requires cullin neddylation, which disrupts inhibitory binding by CAND1 and confers
on the enzyme an active conformation. 5–8 Various combinations of different family
members of CRL components constitute CRL as the largest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases
that, by targeting a variety of substrate proteins, control many important biological
processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, transcription, DNA
replication, and tumorigenesis. 1, 2, 9, 10

SAG, an evolutionarily conserved small RING-containing protein with 113 amino acids,
was originally cloned in our laboratory as a redox inducible antioxidant protein and later
characterized as the second member of the RBX/ROC RING component of CRL E3
ubiquitin ligases. 11–13 In response to various stimuli, such as ROS, mitogen and hypoxia,
SAG is induced at the transcriptional level by transcription factors AP-1 14 and HIF-1, 15
respectively. Induced SAG then recruits other components of CRL E3s to promote the
ubiquitination and degradation of various substrates, including p27, 16 c-Jun, 14 procaspase-3, 17 IκBα, 18, 19 HIF-1α, 15 NOXA, 20 and Nf-1 21 in a cell context, temporal, and
spatial dependent manner. Functionally, we and others have previously shown that ectopic
SAG expression protects cells from apoptosis induced by redox, 11, 22 hypoxia 23 and
various apoptosis-inducing agents [for review, see 24], and promotes the S-phase entry and
cell proliferation under serum starved conditions. 25 Likewise, SAG knockdown by antisense or siRNA transfection inhibits tumor cell growth, 26 and enhances apoptosis induced
by etoposide and TRAIL. 17 SAG knockdown or knockout also enhances cellular sensitivity
to radiation. 18, 20 Most recently, we showed that total Sag knockout in the mouse causes
embryonic lethality at E11.5–12.5 which is associated with overall growth retardation,
massive apoptosis, and diminished vasculogenesis. 21 However, it has not been determined
whether defective vasculogenesis upon Sag disruption plays a causal role in embryonic
lethality, nor has the potential role of Sag in tumor angiogenesis been determined.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we addressed these important issues by the use of a Sag conditional KO mouse
model in which selective Sag deletion in endothelial cells was driven by Tie2-Cre. We
report here that Sag endothelial deletion also causes embryonic lethality but at a later stage
of E15.5, again with defective vasculogenesis and proliferation, indicating its causal role in
vasculogenesis and embryonic viability. We also report that Sag is required for in vitro
endothelial cell migration and tube formation, and in vivo tumor angiogenesis using a
B16F10 melanoma/Sagfl/fl model. Mechanistic and rescuing studies indicated that p27 plays,
at least in part, a key role. Finally, we found that inhibition of CRL activity via cullin
deneddyation by MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme,
causes accumulation of p27 and suppresses in vitro migration and tube formation and in vivo
tumor angiogenesis. Taken together, our study provides the first in vivo demonstration that

1) Sag is required for embryonic vasculogenesis and tumor angiogenesis and 2) small
molecule inhibitors of cullin neddylation (such as MLN4924) may have potential for future
development as a novel class of anti-angiogenesis agents.

RESULTS
Endothelial targeted Sag deletion causes embryonic lethality with reduced vasculogenesis
and proliferation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our recent study revealed that Sag total knockout via a gene trap approach caused
embryonic lethality at E11.5–12.5 days, which is associated with poor vasculogenesis in
both yolk sac and embryos. 21 To define the primary role of Sag in endothelial cells, we first
generated a Sag conditional knockout mouse model in which Cre/LoxP mediated excision
removes the exon 1 of the Sag gene, leading to a frame-shift mutation to produce a small
peptide of 34 amino acids from exon 2 and part of exon 3. This peptide does not contain the
functional RING domain and is a part of the non-functional Sag splicing variant (hSAGMU1) 22 (manuscript in revision elsewhere). To achieve targeted Sag deletion in endothelial
cells, we crossed Sagfl/fl mice with Tie2-Cre mice. Intercrossing of resolving Tie2Cre;Sagfl/+ males with Sagfl/fl females would give rise to the Tie2-Cre;Sagfl/fl mice with Sag
endothelial deletion, if it were not embryonic lethal. Of 72 newborn pulps genotyped, none
of them carried the Tie2-Cre+;Sagfl/fl background (Table 1), indicating that Sag endothelial
deletion also causes embryonic lethality. We next defined at which stage of development the
Tie2-Cre+;Sagfl/fl; embryos die by dissecting uteri of pregnant mice at E13.5 and E15.5.
Genotyping of E13.5 embryos showed a 1:1 ratio of Tie2-Cre+;Sagfl/fl vs. Tie2-Cre−;Sagfl/fl;
background, whereas the ratio becomes 2:1 when E15.5 embryos were dissected (Table 1).
We, therefore, concluded that Sag endothelial deletion causes embryonic lethality around
day E15.5.

Author Manuscript

Dissection of Tie2-Cre+;Sagfl/fl embryos at E13.5 or E15.5 revealed that Sag endothelial
deletion caused slight growth retardation, with smaller embryos as compared to the
heterozygous littermates (Fig. 1A&B). On the other hand, Sag endothelial deletion
remarkably inhibited vasculogenesis. The Tie2-Cre+;Sagfl/fl embryos are pale (Fig. 1A) with
bleeding in various areas of the body (Fig. 1A, right panel), likely resulting from leaking of
red blood cells from the defective vessels. The CD31 whole-mount staining of the E13.5
embryos revealed a significant reduction in the blood vessel density (Fig. 1B). Consistently,
immunofluorescence analysis of Tie2-Cre+;Sagfl/fl; embryonic sections showed a
remarkable reduction in endothelial cells (by CD 31, Fig. 1C&D), overall reduced
proliferation (by Ki67, Fig. 1C&E), but not apoptosis (by cleaved caspase-3, Fig. S1A).
Thus, Sag appears to play a primary role in endothelial proliferation and differentiation, and
Sag deletion is a direct cause of poor embryonic vasculogenesis.
Sag endothelial deletion inhibits in vitro migration, tube formation and proliferation
Given that both total KO and conditional KO of Sag showed endothelial and vascular
defects, we next generated primary endothelial cells (ECs) from the lung and heart tissues of
Sagfl/fl mice and assessed the potential role of Sag in endothelial migration, tube formation
and proliferation in vitro. We first confirmed that the floxed Sag allele can be excised by

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 April 30.

Ad-Cre infection. Indeed, infection of ECs with Ad-Cre caused the excision of floxed Sag
allele to give rise to a 257 bp PCR fragment, as compared to a ~1.6 kb PCR fragment in AdGFP-infected control cells which retained the floxed Sag allele (Fig 2A, top). We then
confirmed that deletion of the floxed Sag allele completely eliminates the Sag protein
expression (2A, bottom). Consistent with in vivo data, Sag deletion in endothelial cells
significantly inhibits in vitro migration (Fig. 2B), tube formation (Fig. 2C) and proliferation
(Fig. 2D), but has little, if any, effect on apoptosis (Fig. S1B). We further examined
potential accumulation of known Sag substrates associated with growth suppression (p21
and p27) and apoptosis (Bim and Noxa) 24. Consistently, Sag deletion caused accumulation
of p21 and p27, moderate increase in Bim, but not Noxa (Fig. 2E). Finally, we determined
potential effect of Sag deletion on expression of VEGF and VEGFR-2 and found a minimal
effect, if any (Fig. S2).

Author Manuscript

Sag knockdown in MS-1 endothelial cells also inhibits in vitro migration, tube formation
and proliferation
We next extended our observation to immortalized mouse endothelial MS-1 cells and found
that lentivirus-based Sag knockdown caused accumulation of p21 and p27, moderate
increase in Bim, but not Noxa (Fig. 3A), and suppression of migration, tube formation and
proliferation (Fig. 3B–D). Suppression of endothelial migration was also observed in human
HUVEC endothelial cells upon lentivirus-mediated SAG knockdown (Fig. S3A–C).
p27 knockdown partially rescues the suppression of migration and proliferation, but not
tube formation, induced by Sag deletion

Author Manuscript

We next investigated potential mechanisms by which Sag deletion alters endothelial
properties. We focused our study on p27, since 1) p27 is a Sag substrate 16 which is
accumulated upon Sag deletion in endothelial cells (Fig. 2E and 3A), and 2) p27 has been
previously implicated in neoangiogenesis, invasion and vascular remodeling. 27, 28 MS-1
cells were infected with lentivirus targeting Sag, along with the scrambled control, followed
by p27 knockdown via siRNA (Fig. 4A). p27 knockdown partially rescued Sag knockdowninduced suppression of endothelial migration (Fig. 4B) and proliferation (Fig. 4C), but not
tube formation (Fig. 4D), suggesting that p27-induced growth suppression affects
endothelial migration, but not tube formation.
Sag EC deletion inhibited in vivo angiogenesis and tumorigenesis

Author Manuscript

We next used two in vivo models to determine the effect of Sag endothelial deletion on
angiogenesis. In an in vivo matrigel plug assay, we injected the matrigel mixed with Ad-Cre
or Ad-GFP control, plus or minus VEGF, into Sagfl/fl mice (left flank for Ad-Cre and right
flank for Ad-GFP). We euthanized mice seven days later and harvested the entire matrigel
plug. Expectedly, VEGF induced remarkable angiogenesis when matrigel was mixed with
the Ad-GFP control, as evidenced by the bloody matrigel plugs (Fig. 5A, top) and the
presence of CD31-positive vessels (Fig. 5A, bottom). In contrast, VEGF-induced
angiogenesis was nearly completely inhibited if Ad-Cre was present, which deleted Sag in
host blood vessels during angiogenesis into matrigel plugs (Fig. 5A).

We further determined the effect of Sag EC deletion on in vivo angiogenesis and
tumorigenesis of B16F10 melanoma cells, a well-established in vivo tumor angiogenesis
model 29. B16F10 cells were mixed with Matrigel containing Ad-Cre or Ad-GFP control
virus and injected into Sagfl/fl mice on the left or right flank, respectively. As an additional
control, B16F10 cells mixed with Matrigel without any virus were also injected. Tumors
were harvested 12 days post-injection, weighed and sectioned for staining with various
antibodies. While Ad-GFP had no effect on tumor growth, as compared to the control, AdCre infection caused remarkable reductions in tumor mass (Fig 5B), blood vessel density (by
CD31 staining, Fig. 5C), and rate of cell proliferation (by Ki67 staining, Fig. 5D), as well as
extensive apoptosis (by TUNEL, Fig. 5E). We also excluded possible toxicity associated
with Ad-Cre virus infection by repeating the experiment in Sagfl/+ mice and found that in
vivo tumor growth was comparable between Ad-Cre and Ad-GFP control (Fig. S4). Thus,
Sag endothelial deletion inhibits the development of host blood vessels into implanted
tumors (inhibition of angiogenesis), leading to growth retardation and apoptosis. We further
determined angiogenesis capacity in skin papillomas induced by DMBA/TPA 19 and found a
significantly increased vessel density in tumors derived from SAG transgenic mice, as
compared to those from non-transgenic control mice (Fig. S5), which likely contributes to
increased tumor size seen in SAG transgenic mice. 19 Thus, both loss-of-function and gainof-function studies support the notion that Sag plays a key role in and is essential for tumor
angiogenesis.
MLN4924 suppresses in vitro migration, tube formation and proliferation

Author Manuscript

It is well-established that activation of CRL ligases requires cullin neddylation. 5–8
MLN4924, a potent inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), was recently found as a
novel class of anticancer agents that inhibits CRL activity via cullin deneddylation and
causes accumulation of tumor suppressive substrates to induce apoptosis. 30 We treated
MS-1 endothelial cells with MLN4924 as a small molecule approach to inactivate CRL
(including Sag-associated ligases) via cullin deneddylation (Fig. 6D, top panel), and found
that MLN4924 significantly inhibited their migration (Fig. 6A), tube formation (Fig. 6B),
and proliferation (Fig. 6C), but not apoptosis (Fig. S6). Consistent with Sag knockdown,
MLN4924 treatment also caused a dose dependent accumulation of p21, p27, and Bim, but
not Noxa (Fig. 6D).
p27 knockdown partially rescues MLN4924-induced suppression of migration and
proliferation, but not tube formation

Author Manuscript

We then determined whether p27 accumulation also plays a crucial role in the observed
suppressive effects of MLN4924. MS-1 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting p27,
along with the scrambled control to silence p27 (Fig. 7A). Consistent with Sag knockdown
study (Fig. 4), p27 knockdown also partially rescued MLN4924-induced suppression of
endothelial migration (Fig. 7B) and proliferation (Fig. 7C), but not tube formation (Fig. 7D).
MLN4924 inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth in an in vivo B16F10 model
Finally, we determined the effect of MLN4924 on in vivo tumor angiogenesis, again using
the B16F10 model. Sagfl/fl mice were treated with MLN4924 subcutaneously at a non-toxic

dose regimen (60 mg/kg, once a day, 5 days per week) 30, 31 for 12 days beginning at 24 hrs
post B16F10 inoculation. Tumors were harvested at day 13, weighed and snap-frozen for
Western blotting or sectioned for staining with various antibodies. We first confirmed that
MLN4924 indeed reached the tumor site by showing a significant inhibition of cullin
neddylation in two independent tumor tissues (Fig. 7A). Similar to Sag deletion, MLN4924
treatment caused significant reductions in tumor mass (Fig. 8B), vessel density (Fig. 8C),
and proliferation (Fig. 8D), as well as extensive apoptosis (Fig. 8E). MLN4924 treatment
also caused a dose dependent accumulation of p21, p27, and Bim, but not Noxa in B16F10
cells (Fig. 8F), indicating a mechanism similar to that of Sag knockdown.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

Our recent study using a genetrap-based Sag total KO mouse model revealed that Sag is
essential for embryonic development, since Sag inactivation causes embryonic lethality
associated with poor vasculogenesis, robust apoptosis, and defects in neural development. 21
However, it is unclear whether defective vasculogenesis is causally related to the embryonic
death. Here we showed that targeted Sag endothelial deletion driven by Tie2-Cre also causes
embryonic lethality (Fig. 1), indicating a causal relationship, although it occurs at the later
time-point during embryogenesis. It is noteworthy that the lethality happens in the wild type
background of Rbx1, a Sag family gene, again indicating non-redundant function of two
family members during embryogenesis. 21, 32 Consistently, the follow-up in vitro assays
using both primary and immortalized endothelial cells revealed that Sag deletion or
knockdown inhibits migration, tube formation and proliferation (Fig. 2&3), but has a
minimal effect, if any, on apoptosis (Fig. S1).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We next focused our mechanistic studies on Sag substrates known to regulate proliferation
and apoptosis and found that upon Sag deletion, p27 is remarkably accumulated, along with
a moderate increase in p21 and a minimal increase in Bim, but not Noxa. It has been
previously reported that in addition to inhibiting cell cycle progression as an inhibitor of
cyclin dependent kinases, p27 also inhibits cell migration, tumor cell invasion and
metastasis via binding to and inhibiting the function of microtubule destabilizing protein
stathmin, 28, 33 although its role in this aspect is still controversial in some cellular
contexts. 34, 35 We therefore examined whether p27 accumulation indeed plays a crucial role
in the observed phenotypic changes by simultaneous knockdown of Sag and p27 in MS-1
endothelial cells. Our results clearly demonstrate that p27 is responsible, at least in part, for
the observed suppression of proliferation and migration induced by Sag knockdown (Fig. 4).
Interestingly, p27 knockdown is unable to rescue the suppression of endothelial tube
formation (Fig. 4), indicating that mechanistically it is independent of p27. Our results
suggest that p27 accumulation upon Sag ablation affects endothelial cell proliferation and
migration, but has a minimal effect on tube formation. Nevertheless, the underlying
mechanism that drives the suppression of tube formation upon Sag deletion warrants a future
investigation.
Having established an essential role of Sag in embryonic vasculogenesis, we next
investigated potential roles of Sag in tumor angiogenesis. It is well-established that
tumorigenesis and angiogenesis are intertwined processes that promote each other. During

tumorigenesis, when tumor mass reaches a certain size, tumor cells secrete pro-angiogenic
factors to promote proliferation and migration of host endothelial cells to the tumor mass to
initiate neovascularization, leading to development of blood vessels. 36 Angiogenesis, in
turn, promotes rapid tumor growth and metastasis. 37–39 Indeed, using a matrigel plug assay,
we showed that VEGF-induced angiogenesis is near completely inhibited by Sag deletion
(Fig. 5). More importantly, using the B16F10 mouse melanoma model, we showed that Sag
deletion during tumor neovascularization significantly inhibits angiogenesis in the tumor
mass, leading to reduced vascular density, and consequent suppression of proliferation and
induction of apoptosis. This eventually causes remarkably reduced tumor size (Fig. 5). Thus,
Sag could be an attractive anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumorigenesis target.

Author Manuscript

We further extended the observations made by our genetic approach via Sag deletion or
knockdown to a small molecule approach using MLN4924, an investigational inhibitor of
CRL E3 ligases via cullin deneddylation. 30 Consistently, we found that MLN4924
significantly suppresses migration, tube formation and proliferation of MS-1 endothelial
cells, and at the same time induces accumulation of p21 and p27 (Fig. 6). We further
confirmed a critical role played by p27 in suppression of migration and proliferation by a
simultaneous p27 knockdown experiment (Fig. 7).

Author Manuscript

Finally, we explored the anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumorigenesis activity of MLN4924
again using a B16F10 melanoma cell model. Our results clearly demonstrate that MLN4924
reaches the tumor site and suppresses tumorigenesis by inhibiting angiogenesis and
proliferation, and also induces apoptosis (Fig. 8). It is anticipated that compared to
permanent Sag deletion, the anti-angiogenesis effect of MLN4924 is less, since the
compound was only given once a day for 12 days and the drug effect is temporary.
Mechanistically, similar to Sag knockdown, MLN4924 treatment also caused accumulation
of p21, p27 and Bim, but not Noxa. It should be noted that MLN4924 is a NAE inhibitor and
would probably inhibit other cellular neddylation reactions, 40, 41 although cullins are the
only known physiological substrates. 40, 42 Nevertheless, given the fact that MLN4924
phenocopies Sag endothelial deletion biologically and mechanistically, the major effect of
MLN4924 against tumor angiogenesis is likely through the inhibition of CRL E3s.
Furthermore, MLN4924 is the first-in-class and only NAE inhibitor currently in phase I
clinical trials for anticancer therapy. 43–45 Our study using both genetic and small molecule
approaches provides proof-of-concept for future development of inhibitors of cullin
neddylation (such as MLN4924) as a novel class of anti-angiogenesis agents through
inactivation of CRL E3 ligases.

Technologies), supplemented with LSGS (Invitrogen) and VEGF (30 ng/ml, PeproTech),
and incubated for 8 to 16 hrs to allow the formation of a tubular structure. The tube length
was measured and calculated by Nikon NIS-Elements BR Version 4.0 software.
TUNEL assay
ECs infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-Cre were assessed for apoptosis by TUNEL assay using
the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche), according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.

BrdU incorporation assay
ECs after 48-hrs infection with Ad-LacZ or Ad-Cre were serum starved for 18 hrs to arrest
cells at the G0 phase. BrdU (100μg/ml) was then added into the culture medium. A BrdU
incorporation assay was performed as described previously 32. Cells were fixed in 4% PFAPBS, and BrdU positive cells detected with a 5-Bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine labeling and
detection Kit II (Roche).
In vivo Matrigel plug assay

Author Manuscript

A total of 0.5 mL Matrigel (BD Biosciences) mixed with Ad-Cre (2.5 × 108 PFU) or AdGFP (2.5 × 108 PFU), 20 units of heparin (Sigma) in the absence or presence of VEGF
(100ng/mL) (PeproTech), was subcutaneously injected into 6 week-old Sagfl/fl mice. After 7
days, the intact Matrigel plugs were collected and photographed. Plugs were embedded and
dissected, the sections were stained with CD31 (Dako).
In vivo anti-angiogenesis assay
B16F10 melanoma cells (5×105) were mixed with Matrigel containing Ad-Cre (5×107 pfu)
or Ad-GFP (2.5×108 pfu) control virus and inoculated subcutaneously in both flanks of mice
with a genotype of Sagfl/fl or Sagfl/+ at 6–8 weeks of age (one side for Ad-Cre, another side
for Ad-GFP). After 12 days, mice were euthanized, and tumors were removed and weighed.
A portion of each tumor was fixed, sectioned and stained with antibodies against CD31,
Ki67 and TUNEL.
MLN4924 antitumor in vivo assay

Author Manuscript

B16F10 melanoma cells (5×105) were mixed with matrigels and inoculated subcutaneously
in both flanks of mice with genotype of Sagfl/fl at age of 6–8 weeks. The next day MLN4924
(60 mg/kg, s.c.) was administrated once a day, 5 days a week for 12 days. Mice in the
control group received 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) as the vehicle
control. 30, 31 Mice were euthanized at the end of the last dosage; their tumors were
harvested and weighed. A portion of each tumor was fixed, sectioned and stained with
antibodies against CD31, BrdU and TUNEL.
