Mu opioids are among the most widely used drugs for patients with cancer with both acute and chronic pain as well as in the perioperative period. Several retrospective studies have suggested that opioid use might promote tumor progression and as a result negatively
impact survival in patients with advanced cancer; however, in the absence of appropriate prospective validation, any changes in recommendations for opioid use are not warranted. In this review, the authors present preclinical and clinical data that support their hypothesis
that the mu opioid receptor is a potential target for cancer therapy because of its plausible role in tumor progression. The authors also
propose the hypothesis that peripheral opioid antagonists such as methylnaltrexone, which reverses the peripheral effects of mu opioids
but maintains centrally mediated analgesia and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opioidC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Mu opioids are among the most widely used drugs for patients with cancer with both acute and chronic pain as well as during the perioperative period.1 Although there exists a family of opioid receptors (mu, kappa, delta, and nociception/orphanin FQ peptide), the G protein-coupled mu opioid receptor (MOR) is the therapeutic target for most clinically used
opioids, including morphine and fentanyl.2 The choice of anesthetic and its influence on cancer progression and outcome
has been extensively studied within the perioperative setting and there is increasing awareness by anesthesiologists of the
value of opioid-sparing techniques.3-7 Over the past decade, there has been evolving literature suggesting a relationship
between the MOR and cancer progression and recurrence extending to the management of chronic cancer pain. Preclinical data from several laboratories have suggested that mu opioids can promote cancer progression,8-10 but to the best of
our knowledge prospective human studies have been limited. The development and approval of methylnaltrexone
(MNTX), a peripherally restricted MOR antagonist, has allowed clinical studies to progress in this area.11 MNTX was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2008 to treat opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with
advanced illness who are receiving palliative care and in whom response to laxatives is insufficient, and more recently to
treat OIC in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain. Because MNTX reverses the peripheral effects of mu opioids but
maintains centrally mediated analgesia, it can be given to patients receiving opioids. MNTX can be used to separate out
the peripheral from central effects of opioids both in the laboratory and in the clinical setting. Although to our knowledge
there are few preclinical studies demonstrating an effect of peripheral opiate antagonists on analgesia, clinical studies
regarding the approved agents naloxegol, alvimopan, and methylnaltrexone at normal therapeutic doses have not shown
an adverse effect on pain control or increased opioid use among patients with acute or chronic pain.
There are significant differences between the perioperative setting, in which opiate-naive individuals often are
exposed to high doses of opiates within a limited time frame, and chronic cancer, in which nearly one-half of patients
receive opiates for considerable periods of time.1 Aside from the differences in clinical time of exposure to mu opiates, it is
important to distinguish the effects of the MOR on tumorigenesis versus effects on tumor growth and metastasis. Very
recently, the relationship between opioid use and cancer progression has been demonstrated in patients with advanced
prostate cancer.12 Although there has yet to be any convincing prospective studies that would mandate a change in

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of a proposed mechanism of
methylnaltrexone (MNTX)’s synergistic effects with mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenic events.
VEGF binding to VEGF receptors induces Src activation (tyrosine phosphorylation), Src-mediated phosphoinositide-3 (PI3)kinase/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)
activation with consequent phospho-threonine (308) Akt phosphorylation, and mTOR complex 2 formation (mTOR/stressactivated protein kinase [SAPK] interacting protein 1 [SIN1]/
Rictor) with consequent phospho-serine (473) Akt phosphorylation. Activated (serine/threonine phosphorylated) Akt promotes mTOR complex 1 formation (mTOR/FKBP12/Raptor),
which is required for endothelial cell proliferation and migration. MNTX inhibits the mu opioid receptor (MOR) and promotes tyrosine phosphatase activity and Src inactivation.
Multiple mTOR inhibitors including temsirolimus bind to
FKBP12 and inhibit mTOR complex 2 formation. Therefore, the
synergistic effects of MNTX on mTOR inhibitors are achieved
through the inhibition of different components of a common
VEGF-induced angiogenic signaling pathway. MNTX can have
significant clinical usefulness by potentially lowering the therapeutic dose of temsirolimus in the treatment of various diseases requiring angiogenesis, including cancer.

practice,7 emerging literature involving epidemiologic,
cellular, and animal data suggests that mu opioids influence cancer progression and recurrence, and that antagonism of the MOR may have a therapeutic role. There also
appear to be effects mediated by the MOR, even in the absence of exogenous opiates.13,14
The purpose of the current study was to present evidence in favor of the involvement of MOR in tumor progression and as a potential target for opiate antagonists in
the treatment of cancer. We also present evidence that the
opiate antagonist MNTX is a potential cancer therapy for
patients receiving opioids due to its ability to separate the
peripheral from central nervous system effects.
Preclinical Studies

Although there have been scattered reports in the literature
regarding the effects of opiates and antagonists on tumor
2682

progression,15,16 considerable attention was brought to the
area after an initial study by Gupta et al8 demonstrated that
morphine, in clinically efficacious concentrations, stimulated angiogenesis in breast cancer xenografts. Based on our
anecdotal observations (Moss, personal oral communication, 2003) that several patients receiving the peripheral
MOR antagonist MNTX in compassionate use protocols
lived longer than expected, we initiated a series of laboratory
studies to examine a possible effect of the MOR on angiogenesis and tumor progression. Initial studies of human pulmonary and dermal cells demonstrated that mu opiates,
such as morphine and fentanyl, exhibited concentrationdependent effects on migration and proliferation. Morphine, at clinically relevant concentrations for perioperative
or palliative care, exhibited approximately 70% of the ability
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to induce
angiogenesis and consequently increase migration and proliferation. These proangiogenic effects were blocked by
doses of MNTX that are effectively used to cause “laxation”
in a concentration-dependent fashion.9
To confirm these findings, the morphine-3glucuronide (M3G) derivative of morphine, which has no
analgesia, failed to demonstrate angiogenesis, whereas the
M6 metabolite, which is analgesic and has an age-related
dependency, was found to be angiogenic in a clinically relevant concentration-effect relationship.9 This study also
revealed that opioids induced reciprocal transactivation of
VEGF1 and VEGF2 receptors. We subsequently demonstrated a synergistic effect of MNTX with both 5fluorouracil (5-FU) and bevacizumab on the inhibition of
VEGF-induced angiogenesis and proliferation in vitro.17
We subsequently demonstrated that MNTX, in concentrations as low as 10 nmol, also inhibited Src in a
concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1).17 Src inhibition appeared to be specific to MNTX whereas naltrexone, the soluble tertiary opioid antagonist, did not exhibit
the same synergistic effect with 5-FU and bevacizumab.
While exploring how an insoluble drug such as MNTX
could affect angiogenesis, we discovered that the receptor
protein tyrosine phosphatase mu (RPTPmu) was the transporter for this signal; silencing the RPTPmu blocked
MNTX synergy with both 5-FU and bevacizumab.17 Subsequent studies have also demonstrated an important synergy of MNTX with mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) antagonists in reducing angiogenesis (Fig. 1).18
Specifically, in vivo matrigel and cellular assays indicated
that MNTX acts synergistically with temsirolimus
through inhibition of various components of a common
pathway, resulting in reduced angiogenesis and
proliferation.

Other data have suggested that MOR agonists can
enhance the metastatic potential of a cancer by increasing
vascular permeability. In a study with human pulmonary
microvascular endothelial cells using measurement of
transendothelial electrical resistance, MOR agonists such
as morphine, at customary clinical doses, were found to
have a significant effect on cell-cell interaction and
increased vascular permeability.8,19 We demonstrated
that MNTX and other opiate antagonists provided barrier
protection against edemagenic agonists through inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) activation19; maintenance of this barrier could play a role in
the prevention of metastases. Conversely, opioids can
help to facilitate the process of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), which ultimately leads to increased
metastatic potential.20-23 It is interesting to note that in
an in vitro study using the non-small cell lung cancer
model (NSCLC), MOR was found to promote both
opioid-induced and growth factor-induced proliferation,
migration, and EMT, which could have been attenuated
by MNTX.24
Further studies have demonstrated that MNTX also
blocks epidermal growth factor-mediated epidermal
growth factor receptor signaling, which is crucial for
human lung cancer cell proliferation and migration.24 In
addition, NSCLC lines exhibited up to a 7-fold increase
in MOR expression compared with normal human bron-

chial epithelial cells.14 To understand whether this in vitro
finding extends to animals, MOR knockout mice were
examined using the Lewis lung carcinoma model and
demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis
(Fig. 2).14,25 Furthermore, silencing the MOR in cancer
cells or treatment with MNTX inhibited metastatic invasion at doses as low as 10 nmol of MNTX.14 In addition,
MNTX infusion was found to inhibit human lung tumor
growth in mice by 2-fold (P =.009) (Fig. 3).25 To determine whether this effect was mediated by the immune system, a study was performed in T cell-deficient nude
mice.26 The results of this study indicated that the overexpression of the MOR in human NSCLC cells promoted
tumor growth in the nude mice, with a 2.5-fold increase
noted in tumor volume compared with controls and a 20fold difference in the rate of metastasis.13 Although the
immune system has been a major focus for the potential
role of anesthetic interventions in altering tumor recurrence after surgery,27 mu opioids have been shown to inhibit interleukin and natural killer cell activity and
plausibly enhance tumorigenicity.28-30 These studies in T
cell-deficient mice demonstrate that a direct effect on the
MOR is sufficient to explain the effects on tumor growth
and proliferation.
In clinically relevant doses, MOR antagonists were
found to reduce tumor growth in lung, head and neck,
and breast tumors.24,31,32 In a study of nude mice injected
with human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and

neck, low-dose naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg) significantly
reduced tumor volume by up to 84%. This was accomplished without exogenous opioids, suggesting an effect of
endogenous opioids, or at least the opioid receptor, on tumor growth and proliferation.33 In malignant melanoma,
in vivo models using MOR knockout mice demonstrated
a marked reduction in tumor growth. Furthermore, the
expression of endogenous mu opioid peptides in tumor
samples from patients with melanoma positively correlated with more advanced disease stage, leading the
authors to suggest that peripheral MOR antagonists can
have clinical usefulness.34

all-cause survival versus placebo (P =.0006). Although

with adjacent control tissue (P =.0242). When the samples from patients with metastatic lung cancer were separated from those
of the cohort of the total number of patients with lung cancer, an approximately 2-fold increase in MOR expression was observed

Clinical Studies

Several retrospective observations have suggested that
opioids influence cancer progression in humans. A
randomized 3-arm clinical trial of 202 patients using either intrathecal drug delivery of morphine plus comprehensive clinical management that included systemic
morphine versus comprehensive clinical management
alone for the reduction of chronic pain (including cancerrelated pain) yielded interesting outcomes: 54% of
patients receiving palliative care who were treated with intrathecal opioids were alive at 180 days compared with
37% of patients receiving systemic opioids (P =.06).38
Although survival was not an endpoint of the study, the
finding of better survival rates among patients in the intrathecal group is consistent with deleterious effects of systemic opioids on tumor progression.
Recent investigations have focused on MOR polymorphisms, particularly A118G. This single-nucleotide
polymorphism leads to a change in the glycosylation site
in the extracellular terminus of the MOR.6,39 Although to
our knowledge the precise function of A118G is
unknown, it has been implicated in drug dependence.40
In a study of 2039 women with breast cancer who were of
different ethnicities, 5% to 24% of the women exhibited
the single-nucleotide polymorphism A118G in the MOR
gene, which is a mutation associated with increased resistance to opioids and prolonged survival.41 Specifically,
patients with A118G heterozygotes had better 10-year
survival compared with those with wild-type MOR
(91.3% vs 95.4% vs 82.4%; P 5 .0001).41 The use of
opioid analgesics was not measured. Similar results were
Cancer

observed in a Chinese study with 260 patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer and 291 controls. The patients
were overrepresented by wild-type MOR, whereas those
with A118G homozygotes had significantly less cancer on
multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 3.12; P 5 .001).42
Finally, as previously mentioned, increased b-endorphin
expression in human melanoma was correlated with
shorter progression-free survival (PFS).34
To our knowledge, there are limited populationbased data regarding whether opioids themselves can precipitate malignancy or influence tumor progression.7,43,44
A retrospective study examining 700 patients and 4000
patient-years compared the influence of methadone maintenance therapy versus chronic naltrexone therapy and
demonstrated no difference in the incidence of cancers45;
however, there were only 5 cancers diagnosed in the entire
patient population, suggesting that this study was underpowered to answer that question.
Another approach has been to examine MOR
expression in tumors. Several laboratories have demonstrated that the MOR is overexpressed in both malignant
lung and prostate tissue.12,46,47 In a small study of 34
patients with NSCLC, samples of adjacent nonmalignant
tissue revealed lower MOR expression on immunohistochemistry compared with tumor samples (P =.02). Furthermore, tumor samples from patients with lymph node
metastases had the highest MOR expression (P =.001)
(Fig. 4).46 A similar observation was reported from a study
with 480 patients with advanced prostate cancer, in which
greater opioid requirements were associated with shorter
PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; P<.001) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.07; P<.001).12 Of special clinical interest, every 5-mg/day increment in the opioid
requirement increased the risk of disease progression by

MOR expression was associated with shorter PFS (HR,

The issue of opioid use perioperatively in cancer surgery has been increasingly recognized in the anesthesia literature over the past decade. A retrospective study of 129
patients with early-stage breast cancer who were undergoing surgery demonstrated a significant difference in 3year recurrence and metastasis-free survival, depending on
2686

whether the patient received a combined general anesthetic with paravertebral block or a general anesthetic that
included opioids (94% vs 77%; P 5 .012).48 Similarly, a
retrospective study of 225 patients with early-stage prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy demonstrated that an epidural plus general anesthesia compared
with general anesthesia with opioids was associated with a
lower risk of disease recurrence (HR, 0.43; P 5 .012).12 A
recent meta-analysis summarized a large number of studies in the anesthesia literature addressing the issue of anesthetic technique and cancer.49 The results of this metaanalysis suggested that epidural anesthesia and/or

analgesia, compared with general anesthesia, might be
associated with improved OS in patients with cancer
undergoing surgical procedures (especially among
patients with colorectal cancer). Very recently, 2 retrospective studies in patients with early-stage NSCLC demonstrated that lung cancer recurrence is related to
perioperative opiate use.43,44 Clinical studies and outcomes are listed in Table 2.12,31,32,38,40-44,46-49
To the best of our knowledge, it is not completely
understood whether observation of an anesthetic effect on
tumors is related to sympathectomy, an effect of local anesthetics, or perhaps a decrease in the use of opioids. Prospective trials investigating whether there is an effect of the type
of anesthetic on surgical outcome in patients with breast,
colon, and lung cancer currently are underway.
Conclusions

There is emerging evidence that MOR expression and signaling plausibly plays a role in cancer progression by interacting
with angiogenesis, EMT, mTOR, Src, and other signaling
pathways. These findings have been substantiated by retrospective data suggesting worse outcomes in patients with cancer who are exposed to systemic opioids or those with high
levels of MOR expression. MNTX is a peripherally acting
MOR antagonist that is used for the treatment of refractory
OIC. Preclinical data have suggested that MOR inhibition
can reverse the adverse effect of MOR signaling on cancer
progression and further investigation in the clinical setting is
warranted. The first dose-finding study, which combines
MNTX with chemotherapy, is currently under way.
