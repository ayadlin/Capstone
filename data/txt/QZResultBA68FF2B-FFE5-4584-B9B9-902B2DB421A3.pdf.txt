BACKGROUND. For patients with localized gastric cancer (LGC) who are receiving
preoperative chemoradiation (CTRT), the postsurgical pathologic stage predicts
overall survival (OS) better than the baseline stage. The authors hypothesized
that presurgical (postCTRT) stage would also correlate better with patient outcome than the baseline stage.

METHODS. The authors analyzed 74 LGC patients treated with preoperative CTRT
receiving similar treatment. Patients were staged with baseline endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and laparoscopy. Patients received induction chemotherapy,
then CTRT (45 Gy), and had an attempted surgery. After CTRT, patients had complete preoperative staging including EUS in 35 patients.

RESULTS. Thirty-five had all 3 sets of staging, baseline, presurgical, and postsurgical. Baseline stage did not associate with OS (P 5 .16) nor disease-free survival
(DFS; P 5 .13). However, presurgical stage was associated with OS (P 5 .01), and
DFS (P 5 .05). OS was also associated with postsurgical stage and was longer for
stages 0 and I than for stages III and IV (P 5 .01 and .04, respectively). Similarly,
DFS was longer in postsurgical pathologic stages 0, I, and II than in stage III or

CONCLUSIONS. Heterogeneity in clinical biology of LGC is best reflected after
CTRT in presurgical and postsurgical pathologic stages rather than by the baseline stage. Correlation of outcome with presurgical staging may facilitate strategies to individualize therapy for LGC. Cancer 2007;110:989–95.  2007 American

lthough its incidence is decreasing, gastric cancer is rarely
detected early in the western hemisphere, thus accounting for
its poor prognosis. In approximately half of newly diagnosed cases,
the carcinoma is advanced beyond its original locoregional boundaries.1 Surgery remains the primary therapy for localized gastric cancer.2–6 Nevertheless, the rate of curative R0 resection is achieved in
<50% in patients treated with surgery alone.7 Distant metastases
and locoregional recurrence can also be a significant problem, the
latter reaching as high as 54% after surgical resection in some series.8,9 However, for patients with localized gastric carcinoma, the
strategy of preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CTRT) is emerging
as a promising mode of treatment.10–12 In a recently published

study, we reported that postsurgical pathologic stage
as determined by the American Joint Commission on
Cancer (AJCC) is a better predictor of overall survival
(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than baseline
clinical stage (before CTRT) because of changes in
cancer stage brought about by treatment.13 However,
it is still undetermined whether presurgical stage
(post-CTRT) is also a better predictor of OS than
baseline clinical stage. Such a finding would have
immense implications, perhaps allowing patients
who may have poor OS and/or DFS, as determined
by presurgical stage, to be spared unnecessary surgery. We hypothesized that presurgical stage, and not
the baseline clinical stage, would be the best prognosticator of OS and DFS. To test this hypothesis, we
examined OS and DFS in relation to baseline, presurgical, and postsurgical pathologic stage by using data
from 2 prospectively conducted preoperative CTRT
trials.10,11

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study examined patient populations from 2 prospective preoperative CTRT trials.10,11 Both protocols
were similar in terms of patient selection and therapeutic strategy. The chemotherapy combination
administered before and during CTRT varied only to
some extent; however, this slight variation in chemotherapy in 2 trials is not considered fundamentally
different.

Patient Selection and Evaluation
Patients with localized, histologically confirmed gastric
or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were eligible for
either trial. The bulk of cancer was in the stomach,
although the gastroesophageal junction may have
been involved. As part of the staging workup, patients
had a chest radiograph, computed tomography (CT)
scan of the abdomen (pelvis and chest were scanned
if needed [CT pelvis was often done in women and CT
chest in patients with gastroesophageal junction involvement]), upper gastrointestinal barium radiographs,
esophagogastroduodenoscopy with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), electrocardiogram, SMA-12 serum
chemistry panel, complete blood count, and measurement of electrolyte and carcinoembryonic antigen
levels. Patients with T2 to T3 carcinoma with (N1) or
without lymph node involvement (N0) and patients
with T1N1 carcinoma were eligible to be in these clinical trials. T-classification was determined by EUS only.
Laparoscopic staging and J-tube placement were performed in all patients. Nutritional counseling was provided as needed. All patients provided written
informed consent after the above evaluation was com-

pleted and after they had recovered from laparoscopic
staging. A multidisciplinary evaluation was also performed before patients participated in the clinical
trials.
Patients ineligible for inclusion in the clinical
trials were those with T4, M1, or T1N0 carcinoma,
peritoneal carcinomatosis (gross or microscopic), or
uncontrolled medical conditions (eg, diabetes, hypertension, NY Heart Association class III or IV, or psychiatric illness). Patients who could not comprehend
or comply with the study requirements were also
ineligible.

Design of Clinical Trials
Patients were to receive 1 or 2 cycles of induction
chemotherapy and then CTRT. The second induction
chemotherapy cycle was given if the cancer had not
progressed and was skipped if the cancer did progress. Patients were taken off protocol if distant metastases developed. Clinical responses were judged
by using radiographic or endoscopic techniques.
If a patient subsequently underwent an R0 resection, no further therapy was given. In the case of R1
resection (microscopically positive margin), R2 resection (only partial resection), or discovery of M1 carcinoma, the patient was given palliative care (systemic
chemotherapy or only best supportive care was
offered depending on the circumstances). Each
patient was assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and
then every 6 months for 5 years or until the patient’s
death.
Step 1: Chemotherapy
In both trials,10,11 patients received 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy. In 1 trial,10 patients received
5-FU, cisplatin, and leucovorin, and in the second
trial,11 patients received 5-FU, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. If the cancer had not progressed, then the second cycle was to be repeated 28 days after the first
cycle began. Complete blood counts were performed
weekly. Serum chemistries were monitored before
each course.
Step 2: Chemoradiotherapy
In both trials,10,11 patients received 5-FU with radiation therapy; however, in the second trial,11 patients
also received weekly paclitaxel. The interval between
Day 1 of the last induction chemotherapy cycle and
the first day of CTRT was 28 days. Radiation fields
included the entire stomach, perigastric extension (if
present), and draining lymph nodes (gastric, celiac,
porta hepatis, gastroduodenal, splenic-suprapancreatic, and retropancreaticoduodenal). For lesions involving the cardia or gastroesophageal junction, a 5-cm

margin of esophagus was included, and for distal
lesions at or near the gastroduodenal junction, a
5-cm margin of duodenum was included. Esophagoscopy, barium-swallow radiographs, and CT scan of
the chest and abdomen were used to determine the
maximal extent of disease relative to the primary tumor and the nodal groups. Idealized fields were
modified as needed to shield at least two-thirds of 1
kidney. For proximal lesions, cardiac shielding was
recommended, along with evaluation of lateral fields
for a component of treatment. Linear accelerators
delivered a dose of 45 Gy (25 fractions of 1.8 Gy)
over 5 weeks by using either 15-MV or 18-MV
photons or a 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
technique. Typically, anterior and posterior fields
were sometimes positioned slightly obliquely to
avoid the spinal cord and the right kidney.

Step 3: Surgery
The type of surgery performed depended on the
location and extent of the primary cancer. The cancer was resected along with a luminal gastric margin
of 5 cm when feasible. Also when feasible, a 2-cm
duodenal margin was obtained for distal cancers,
and a 3-cm esophageal margin was obtained for
proximal cancers. In both cases, frozen-section confirmation of a negative margin was sought. For distal
cancers, a subtotal gastrectomy was considered adequate; total gastrectomy was at the discretion of the
surgeon. For proximal cancers, total gastrectomy or
total esophagogastrectomy was performed. An en
bloc resection of adjacent organs was performed
when their involvement was questionable. The
spleen was preserved when possible. An attempt was
made to perform a D2-type nodal dissection. During
surgery, a J-tube was placed for temporary nutritional support.

Tumor Response
Upper gastrointestinal barium radiographs were
taken after each 28-day cycle of induction chemotherapy just before surgery and just before esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Connecticut scan of the
abdomen, chest radiography, and all blood tests were
repeated before surgery. Endoscopic ultrasonography
just before surgery was optional and was performed
in only 35 patients. Previously described criteria for
response evaluation were used.11 Briefly, pathologic
complete response (pathCR) was defined as an absence of carcinoma cells in the primary site, and
pathologic partial response (pathPR) was defined as
<10% residual carcinoma cells in the specimen.

991

Staging
Baseline and presurgical (postCTRT) staging were
performed by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and radiologic imaging studies. Endoscopy and radiologic
imaging studies were repeated a few days before
surgery. Finally, post-treatment pathologic stage
was determined by examination of the resected specimens.

Statistical Analyses
With data from the 2 clinical trials, 2 sets of analyses
were performed. First, chi-square and Fisher exact
test were used to examine whether baseline and/or
presurgical N-classification, T-classification, and/or
overall stage were associated with incidence of death
and/or relapse (locoregional recurrence or distant
metastasis). These tests were also used to determine
associations between baseline and/or presurgical
stage and incidence of pathCR or R0 resection. Logrank tests were used to compare overall survival and
disease-free survival among various baseline, presurgical, and postsurgical stages. Kaplan-Meier curves
were generated and plotted for the patients stratified
by baseline and presurgical T, N, and EUS stage. All
statistical tests were 2-sided, and significance was set
at the 0.05 level. Overall survival was calculated from
the date of first treatment on the protocol, and disease-free survival was calculated from the date of
surgery.

RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
From the 74 total patients who were enrolled in the
2 clinical studies, baseline and presurgical EUS staging were determined for 35 patients. Thus, results
are based on analysis of 35 patients. The median age
was 58 years (range, 30–69 years), and all patients
had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance score of 1. Baseline and presurgical
characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1.
Most patients were male (n 5 24, 69%), and the cancers of most patients were poorly differentiated
(n 5 29, 83%). Location of tumor was evenly distributed between distal and proximal, (51% and 49%,
respectively). Most cancers were classified as baseline EUS stage III (n 5 17, 49%), T3 (n 5 30, 86%),
and/or N1 (n 5 21, 60%). Regarding presurgical staging, most cancers were classified as stage II
(n 5 15, 43%), T3 (n 5 20, 57%), and/or N0 (n 5 24,
69%). Most cancers were down-staged after CTRT
(n 5 19; 54%).

There was no correlation between baseline EUS
stage and proportion of patients alive at the median
follow-up of 381 months (stages I and II 5 76% vs
stages III and IV 5 55%, P 5 .12); however, a greater
proportion (81%) of patients with presurgical stages I

and IV cancer (25%) were alive at follow-up (P < .01;
Table 2). There was no association between OS baseline N-classification (N0 5 43% vs N1 5 57%,

between OS and presurgical N-classification (N0 5

survived significantly longer without relapse than
patients with presurgical stages III and IV (median

DISCUSSION
Locally advanced gastric cancer poses a challenging
situation and yet a potential opportunity because it
is a potentially curable condition. Most patients have
either stage II or III cancer by baseline clinical stage.

FIGURE 2. Kaplan-Meier curves comparing disease-free survival (DFS)
among patients stratified by (a) baseline stage, (b) presurgical stage, and (c)
postsurgical stage. There was no significant difference between postsurgical
stages 0 versus I, 0 versus II, and I versus II. P-values were obtained from
log-rank tests.

Even with the advent of the value of preoperative
and postoperative chemotherapy compared with surgery,14 surgery continues to be used as primary therapy, and adjuvant postoperative chemoradiation is
given to selected patients. Clinical biology of localized gastric cancer suggests that even if cancers are
grouped in 1 particular stage (for example, stage II),
not all can be expected to behave similarly, and outcomes can vary considerably. The response to therapy, DFS, OS, metastatic potential, and cure rates are
different. Clearly, we do not have the tools to understand how to individualize therapy for our patients.
Until we have a much deeper understanding of the
molecular biology of localized gastric cancer, it may
be difficult to individualize therapy. Until such time,
we must explore the possible benefits of staging at
different junctures of therapy.
Baseline clinical staging remains an important
step in the evaluation of patients with localized gastric
cancer. However, it does not seem to predict overall
survival and disease-free survival. In some patients,
the true stage of gastric cancer is altered by therapy
(particularly chemoradiation therapy resulting in pathologic complete response or only microscopic residual
cancer). In other patients who are receiving preoperative chemoradiation, the cancer can be nearly totally
chemoradiation resistant.15 Chemoradioresistant cancer often has high metastatic potential, and the life
span of such patients can be very short.16 Identification of a chemoradioresistant cancer before surgery
(by presurgical staging, if reliable) could spare these
patients the morbidity of surgery. This issue has not
been fully discussed in literature. Although our data
are based on a small number of patients and quite
preliminary, they are also provocative. A confirmation
of our observations is needed and should be followed
by a validation study before a change in the clinical
decision process is implemented.
In this study of 35 patients who had all 3 types
of sophisticated staging, baseline, presurgical, and
systematic evaluation of surgical pathology,16 our
data suggest that preoperative staging correlates
significantly with overall survival and disease-free
survival. We already know that postoperative surgical
staging definitely correlates with overall survival and
disease-free survival.
In conclusion, presurgical stage, including EUS,
appears to correlate better with overall survival and
disease-free survival than does baseline stage. Similarly, presurgical stage correlates better with postsurgical pathologic stage than it does with the baseline
stage. Further refinement of presurgical staging by
EUS-directed fine-needle aspiration of suspicious
nodes or positron emission tomography may be war-

ranted. In addition to confirmation of our data,
future prospects in individualization of therapy for
this group of patients will require detailed analyses
of tumor biology and patients’ genetics.
