ABSTRACT
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) has been shown to promote breast cancer growth via
different mechanisms. In addition to binding to ERα, the DHT membrane receptor exists
on integrin αvβ3. Resveratrol induces p53-dependent apoptosis via plasma membrane
integrin αvβ3. Resveratrol and DHT signals are both transduced by activated ERK1/2;
however, DHT promotes cell proliferation in cancer cells, whereas resveratrol is proapoptotic. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which DHT inhibits resveratrolinduced apoptosis in human ERα positive (MCF-7) and negative (MDA-MB-231) breast
cancer cells. DHT inhibited resveratrol-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-15 of p53 in
a concentration-dependent manner. These effects of DHT on resveratrol action were
blocked by an ERα antagonist, ICI 182,780, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. DHT inhibited
resveratrol-induced nuclear complex of p53-COX-2 formation which is required p53dependent apoptosis. ChIP studies of COX-2/p53 binding to DNA and expression of
p53-responsive genes indicated that DHT inhibited resveratrol-induced p53-directed
transcriptional activity. In addition, DHT did inhibit resveratrol-induced COX-2/p53dependent gene expression. These results suggest that DHT inhibits p53-dependent
apoptosis in breast cancer cells by interfering with nuclear COX-2 accumulation which
is essential for stimulation of apoptotic pathways. Thus, the surface receptor sites for
resveratrol and DHT are discrete and activate ERK1/2-dependent downstream effects on
apoptosis that are distinctive. These studies provide new insights into the antagonizing
effects of resveratrol versus DHT, an important step toward better understanding and
eventually treating breast cancer. It also indicates the complex pathways by which
apoptosis is induced by resveratrol in DHT-depleted and -repleted environments.

INTRODUCTION

Resveratrol (3, 5, 4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene)
is a naturally occurring trihydroxyl-diphenylethylene
compound which has beneficial effects in the treatment
of cancer and cardiovascular disease [28–31]. It inhibits
carcinogen-induced pre-neoplastic lesions and mammary
tumors in rodent models [32]. Resveratrol is able to bind
to and to activate ER but with far lower affinity than
E2 does [33]. As other selective ER modulators such
as tamoxifen, resveratrol has been considered to have
potential as an anti-breast cancer adjunct [32]. Although
mechanisms involved in the resveratrol-induced antiproliferation of cancers are not fully understood, recently,
we have shown that resveratrol induces anti-proliferation
via integrin αvβ3 [34] binding site to activate ERK1/2, to
induce nuclear accumulated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
and p53-dependent mechanism in breast cancer, glioma,
head and neck squamous cell cancer and ovarian cancer
cells [29, 30, 35, 36]. The nuclear accumulated COX-2
forms complex with phosphorylated p53 and ERK1/2 as
a co-activator for p53-responsive genes [35, 36].
In the present study, we investigate the hypothesis
that both resveratrol and DHT induced ERK1/2 activation
and led to the disparate effects via different receptors in
ER-α-positive and negative breast cancer cells. In ER
positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells, DHT bound to ER and
it bound to integrin αvβ3 in ER-negative MDA-MB cells.
However, resveratrol bound to integrin αvβ3 in both types
of cancer cells. While DHT stimulates breast cancer cell
proliferation, the nuclear accumulation of COX-2 and p53dependent action of resveratrol induces anti-proliferation.
Resveratrol-associated apoptosis requires inducible
accumulation of nuclear COX-2 upstream of p53. The
inhibition of apoptosis by DHT in resveratrol-treated
cells is initiated at the activated ERK1/2 after DHT binds
to integrin receptor on the cell surface for the hormone;
this leads to suppress the nuclear interaction of COX-2
protein and activated ERK1/2, which is essential to the
pro-apoptotic action of resveratrol. This nuclear complex
is formed in breast cancer cells exposed to resveratrol,
alone, but does not occur in DHT-treated cells or in cells
incubated with both resveratrol and DHT.

Androgens have important physiological effects on
women [1]. They are the precursor hormones for estrogen
biosynthesis in the ovaries and extragonadal tissues [2]
and also function directly via androgen receptors (ARs)
throughout the body [3]. AR is expressed in normal breast
cells, and up to 85% of breast tumors are AR positive [4].
Yeh et al indicate that AR plays an important role in breast
cancer proliferation [5]. However, stimulation with
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) induces
breast cancer cell proliferation through the ER [6, 7],
but inhibits proliferation through AR. Studies show
that plasma testosterone concentrations appear to be
associated with increased breast cancer risk among
postmenopausal hormone users [8]. Other epidemiological
studies also suggest that plasma levels of testosterone are
significantly associated with breast cancer risk in pre- and
postmenopausal women [9]. Furthermore, high baseline
levels of serum testosterone have emerged as a strong
prognostic factor for contralateral breast cancer, distant
metastasis and local relapse [10], although it is debatable
that testosterone effects on breast cancer progression
could also result from conversion to 17β-estradiol (E2)
via aromatization in peripheral tissues [5]. Thymidine
uptake studies also indicate that the non-aromatizable
androgen metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, DHT-induced
[3H]-thymidine incorporation can be inhibited by ICI
182,780, a pure anti-estrogen that serves as an antagonist
of the ER in ER-α-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells
[11, 12] in which other ERs such as ER-β, GPR30 and
ER-α spliced variants such as ER-α36, and ER-α46 also
exist [13–16]. On the other hand, the action of DHT is
blocked by RGD peptide which blocks the binding site
on integrin αvβ3 in ER-α-negative MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells which contain ER-α36 and GPR30 [13].
Although ER-α36 [13,  14] GPR30 [15] and ER-β [16]
have been shown to play roles in cell proliferation, the
mechanisms involved are not fully understood.
Studies also indicate that the proliferative signal
induced by DHT is transduced by discrete mechanisms in
ER-α-positive and ER-α-negative breast cancer cells [11].
Interestingly, the role of integrin αvβ3 on ER-α-positive
breast cancer MCF-7 cells is controversy, although it is
reported that there is no integrin αvβ3 existing on MCF-7
cells [17, 18] and others suggest integrin αvβ3 exists on
MCF-7 cells [19].
Phosphoinositide 3-OH kinases (PI3Ks) are a group
of major intracellular signaling molecules [20] whose
activation has been shown to be involved in proliferation
and development of tumors [21]. Estrogen activates PI3K/
Akt and ERK1/2 signalings through ER-α-dependent
mechanism which is involved in cell proliferation in breast
cancer cells [22–24]. Inhibition of PI3K also inhibits
cancer growth [22, 25–27].

RESULTS
DHT interferes with resveratrol-induced antiproliferation in breast cancer cells
When human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were treated
with 10 μM resveratrol, there was activation of ERK1/2
and Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53. DHT (10−9M) induced
activation of ERK1/2, in addition, DHT also activated
PI3K but not phosphorylation of p53. In the presence of
DHT, resveratrol-induced Ser-15 p53 phosphorylation was
inhibited by DHT in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). However,
ERK1/2 activated by resveratrol and DHT was additive.

Resveratrol also induced ERK1/2 activation and Ser-15
p53 phosphorylation in ER-negative breast cancer MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, DHT induced
ERK1/2 and PI3K but not p53 activation (Fig. 1B).
The activation of p53 by resveratrol was inhibited by
co-treatment of DHT and the activation of PI3K by DHT
was blocked by resveratrol co-treatment but the ERK1/2
activation was not inhibited by the co-treatment (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, resveratrol-induced apoptosis in breast
cancer MCF-7 cells was also inhibited by DHT treatment
(Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed in ER-α-negative
breast cancer MBA-MB cells (Fig. 2B).
We also studied the concentration effect of
DHT on resveratrol-induced signals. MDA-MB-231

cells were treated with resveratrol in the presence or
absence of DHT (10−10–10−8 M) for 4 h. Resveratrolinduced Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53 was inhibited by
DHT in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A).
The effect of 10−10–10−8 M DHT on resveratrol-induced
anti-proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells, indicated
by nucleosome ELISA, is shown in Fig. 3B. The
similar findings that DHT reduced resveratrol-induced
anti-proliferation dose-dependently were also observed
in MCF-7 cells by using MTT assay (Fig. 3C). Doseresponsive inhibition by DHT of anti-proliferation in
these resveratrol-treated cells correlates directly with the
reduction in phosphorylation of Ser-15 p53 seen above
(Fig. 3A).

DHT interferes with resveratrol-induced antiproliferation via different binding sites

Studies were also conducted in ERα negative
MDA-MB-231 cells. DHT, RV or the combination was
added to cells treated with 0.5 μg/ml of anti-integrin
αvβ3 antibody for 24 h previously. Resveratrol induced
p53 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation which was
inhibited by co-treatment with DHT. The DHT induced
PI3K activation which was inhibited by resveratrol. In
the pretreatment of anti-integrin antibody, the resveratrolinduced p53 phosphorylation and the DHT-induced
PI3K activation were blocked by the antibody (Fig. 5).
These results suggest that resveratrol and DHT share
integrin αvβ3 as their binding sites in ERα negative MDAMB-231 cells.

Previously we have shown that DHT binds to
different binding sites in breast cancer cells to activate
signal transduction pathway, which activates ERK1/2 and
cell proliferation [11]. It binds to ERα in ERα positive
breast cancer MCF-7 cells and to integrin αvβ3 in ER
negative MDA-MB-231 cells. In order to investigate the
mechanisms involved in DHT-induced inhibitory effects
on resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation in human breast
cancer cells, studies have been designed to treat ERαpositive with resveratrol and DHT in the presence or
absence of ERα antagonist, ICI182,780 [37]. Both DHT
and resveratrol induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4). DHT
inhibited resveratrol-induced phosphorylation of Ser-15
of p53. In the presence of ICI, the effect of resveratrol
was not affected but the DHT-induced actions were
inhibited including the inhibitory effect on resveratrol
(Fig. 4). ICI did not inhibit resveratrol-induced Ser-15
phosphorylation of p53. On the other hand, DHT blocked
Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53 induced by resveratrol, but
in the presence of DHT and ICI, the inhibitory effect of
the hormone on phosphorylation of p53 was not seen. The
action on ERK1/2 activation by DHT alone was inhibited
by ICI. The inhibitory effect of DHT on resveratrolinduced Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53 appears to be
ER-mediated, in that this hormone effect was reversed by
the ER inhibitor.

DHT inhibits resveratrol-induced nuclear
accumulation of COX-2, binding of p53 to DNA
and p53-dependent gene expression
Resveratrol induces nuclear accumulation of COX2 which facilitates resveratrol-induced p53-dependent
apoptosis [29, 30, 35, 36]. Treatment of MDA-MB-231
cells with resveratrol in the presence of DHT resulted
in not only reducing the nuclear tanslocation of COX-2,
but also decreasing the nuclear complex of COX-2 and
p53 (Fig.  6A). Similar complexing between COX-2
and p53 was observed when nuclear proteins were
immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody (Fig. 6B).
p53 and COX-2 have been shown to bind to p53responsive gene promoter sequences [35, 36, 38]. Estrogen

(pERK1/2, top panel, lane 3) was enhanced by 10−10–10−8 M DHT. However, RV-induced Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53 was inhibited by

inhibits resveratrol-induced apoptosis by inhibiting
p53-dependent gene expression in human breast cancer
cells [38]. The androgen may show the same inhibition
of resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation by blocking
promoter-binding activity. To determine whether p53responsive gene promoter activity is affected by androgen,
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were
performed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Results shown in
Fig. 6C indicate that resveratrol induced nuclear COX-2
to bind to the p53-responsive gene promoter, Bax and
PIG3. Further, DHT inhibited interaction of COX-2 with
p53 (Fig. 6A and 6B) and the promoter DNA sequence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Fig. 6C). Therefore, DHT inhibits not only resveratrolinduced post-translational modification of p53 as shown
above, but also DNA binding by COX-2/p53.
To determine the functional significance of the ChIP
results, QPCR studies were carried out. In our studies of
transcription by QPCR in MDA-MB-231 cells, resveratrol
induced expression of CASP2, p53, and COX-2 (Fig. 7A).
On the other hand, DHT , 10−9 M, alone stimulated the
expression of HIF-1α and β-catenin, but not PCNA. When
cells were pretreated with DHT, the resveratrol-inhibited
genes expression were reversed (Fig. 7A). Similar results

concentration-dependent. The effect of 10−10–10−8 M

DHT in these resveratrol-treated cells directly correlates
with the reduction in the Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53
(Fig. 3A).
Although resveratrol has been shown by others
to have estrogen-like activity in a transcriptional
assay in cells expressing predominantly ERα [32,
41]. ICI 182,780, in a relatively low concentration of
3 nM, does not reduce resveratrol-induced activation
of ERK1/2 and serine phosphorylation of p53 [38].
Since DHT action is inhibited by ICI 182,780 in
MCF-7 cells, while resveratrol activity is not affected
by ICI 182,780 (Fig. 4), the inhibitory effect of DHT
on resveratrol-induced serine phosphorylation of p53 is
interpreted to be ER mediated. On the other hand, both
resveratrol- and DHT-induced activities were inhibited
by anti-integrin αvβ3 antibody in ER-α negative breast
cancer cells (Fig. 5).
Since the effect of resveratrol that we have
demonstrated in breast cancer cells focuses on the
modification and action of the tumor suppressor p53, it

DISCUSSION
We demonstrate that DHT interfered with
resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation in both ER-α-positive
MCF-7 and ER-α-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast
cancer cells. The role of ER-α in the proliferative effect
of DHT in MCF-7 cells is demonstrated by the actions of
the specific inhibitor of ER, ICI 182,780 to block DHTinduced proliferation [11]. In MDA-MB-231 cells, a novel
mechanism was implicated, in that anti-integrin αvβ3
or an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide targeted at a binding
domain of the integrin each eliminated the DHT effect on
cell proliferation [11]. Treatment of AR-positive prostate
cancer LNCaP cells with resveratrol induces a decrease
in receptor levels that is more pronounced at the highest
concentration used of 150 μM [39]. In an androgeninsensitive prostate cancer PC-3 cell line not expressing
AR but having ER-α [40], resveratrol induces reduction
in ER-α with a maximum effect at 100–150 μM [39].
However, the concentration of resveratrol used in our
studies did not exceed 10 μM, thus there may be other
inhibitory mechanisms involved in the interference of DHT
on resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation in breast cancer
cells.
In DHT concentration–response studies, there
was hormone concentration-dependent enhancement

is conceivable that cancer cells harboring mutant p53
might not respond in the same manner. However, studies
by Hsieh et al, have documented resveratrol-induced
reduction in growth of MDA-MB-435 cells, which
contain a mutant p53 [42]. In our studies of the actions
of resveratrol on DU145 prostate cancer cells, which also
contain mutant p53, resveratrol did induce apoptosis [43].

the enhancement by DHT of ERK1/2 activity. The
downstream consequence of ERK1/2 activation by DHT
alone did not induce apoptosis as other steroid hormones
do [29, 38], compared with the actions of resveratrol.
Thus, although both resveratrol and DHT induce
ERK1/2 activation , divergent effecs are observedin
the downstream ERK1/2 on nuclear transcription of
COX-2 and p53 by resveratrol and blocking apopotosis
by DHT. This is consistent with the existence of discrete
intracellular pools of ERK1/2 regulated by resveratrol
and DHT separately. The anti-apoptotic effect of DHT
in the presence of resveratrol involves rapid stimulation
of signaling cascades, including the ERK1/2 pathway. In
our studies, the ER inhibitor ICI 182,780 suppressed both
DHT-induced ERK1/2 activation and the inhibitory effect
of DHT on resveratrol-induced Ser-15 phosphorylation
of p53 (Fig. 4). Similar observation is seen in the effect
of thyroid hormone-inhibited resveratrol-induced antiproliferation in glioma cells by interfering with the
interaction of nuclear COX-2 and ERK1/2 [29]. This
finding is consistent with DHT inhibition of posttranslational modifications of p53 that are essential for
p53-dependent gene transcription.
Androgen-induced ERK1/2 activation, in
contrast to ERK1/2 activation which is also observed
in resveratrol, will not cause apoptosis, and we do not
expect that androgen will cause p53 phosphorylation.
We have shown that another steroid hormone, E2
inhibits resveratrol-induced p53-dependent apoptosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by interfering with p53 binding on promoter and
p53-dependent p21 expression  [38]; therefore, it is
not surprising to observe that DHT performs the same
way to block COX-2 binding to promoters in ChIP
assay and p53-dependent gene expression (Fig. 6C
and Fig. 7). DHT alone had no effect on the binding
of p53 to a relevant oligonucleotide. However, DHT
did inhibit resveratrol-induced binding of p53 to the
oligonucleotide (Fig.  6C). In our previous study,
resveratrol has been shown to highly upregulate genes
supporting anti-proliferation such as CASP2 and genes
that support apoptosis, e.g., BAD, p53, TP53I3, p21,
c-fos and COX-2 [31]. We also showed that resveratrol
induced the expression of COX-2, CASP2 and p53, but
inhibited the expression of PCNA, HIF-1α and β-catenin
(Fig. 7) which play roles in cancer proliferation and
metastasis.
The present studies indicate that ambient DHT may
antagonize actions of resveratrol in selected treatment
paradigms. Our results suggest that the complexity of
actions of resveratrol might occurr in both in vivo and
in  vitro settings. When resveratrol is tested in intact
animals, it would be important to control for levels of
androgen, and useful to examine actions of the nature
stilbene in the presence of a DHT antagonist. As indicated
above, we know that both DHT and resveratrol have
receptor sites on integrin αvβ3 in ER-negative breast
cancer cells and that both hormone and stilbene activate
ERK1/2. However, it is difficult to demonstrate the
35874

existence of discrete hormone- and stilbene-binding sites
on integrin αvβ3 in ER-α negative breast cancer cells,
although the antagonism is raised by DHT in the action
of resveratrol on signaling events that promotes apoptosis
is clear.
In summary, DHT via distinct binding receptors
in ER-positive and negative breast cancer cells, ERα
in ER-positive and integrin αvβ3 in ER-negative breast
cancer cells activated ERK1/2 and further stimulated
cell proliferation (Fig. 8). On the other hand, resveratrol
bound to integrin αvβ3 to activate ERK1/2, nuclear
COX-2 accumulation and phosphorylated p53 and
COX-2 complexing which further induced expression of
pro-apoptotic genes and anti-proliferation (Fig. 8). All the
actions downstream the ERK1/2 activation were targeted
by DHT for interference. Results presented here indicated
that it is possible to use resveratrol therapeutically in
breast cancer treatment. However, in addition to estrogen,
DHT may be another interfering factor for resveratrol
therapy and resveratrol may be most effective in a DHTdepleted environment. In addition, it may be clinically
practicable to treat ER positive breast cancer patients
with resveratrol in the present of ICI or tamoxifen to
block the interference with DHT and estrogen. The
usage of resveratrol therapy in ER-negative breast
cancer patients may raise more concern than expected in
the future.

total cell lysates of MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells
which were treated with 10 μM resveratrol and/or 10−9 M
DHT. Protein samples were resolved on a 10% Sodium
Dodecyl Sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE).
A 20-μg quantity of protein was loaded in each well with
5x sample buffer, and the protein samples were resolved
by electrophoresis at 100 V for 2 hrs. The resolved
proteins were transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to
Millipore Immobilon-PSQ Transfer PVDF membranes
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with the Mini TransBlot® Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA,
USA). The membranes were blocked with a solution of
2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. The
membranes were incubated with primary antibodies to
phospho-p44/42 MAPK (pERK1/2), ERK2, pSer15-p53,
p53, pPI3K(p85), PI3K (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.,
Beverly, MA, USA), β-actin (GeneTex International
Corporation, Hsinchu City, Taiwan), Lamin B1 (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), at 4°C overnight and washed, and
the proteins were detected with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies and ImmobilonTM Western HRP Substrate
Luminol Reagent (Millipore). Images of the Western blots
were visualized and recorded by BioSpectrum® Imaging
System (UVP, LLC, Upland, CA, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To examine whether DHT affects the resveratrolinduced nuclear accumulated COX-2 and forms
complex with phosphorylated p53. Nuclear and
cytoplasm proteins were extracted and isolated from
MDA-MB-231 cells by means of the Thermo Scientific
NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit
protocol (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). The
cells underwent lysis in cytoplasm extraction reagent
and were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for extraction of the
nuclear material. Proteins from the nuclear material were
extracted by the addition of nuclear extraction reagent
to the nuclei and centrifugation at 16,000 × g. Nuclear
extracts were stored at −80°C until use. The protein
concentration in the nuclear extracts was measured
with the BCATM Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific).
Samples containing 200 μg nuclear proteins were
immunoprecipitated with the rabbit anti-COX-2
antibody (Abcam) or p53 (Cell Signaling Technology)
followed by Western blotting with antibodies of antipSer15-p53, p53, or COX-2. The anti-Lamin B1
antibody (Abcam) was used as loading control.

Cell lines
Human breast cancer MCF-7 (ER-α-positive,
ATCC® HTB-22™) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-negative,
ATCC® HTB-26™) cells were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA)
by Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC,
Hsinchu, Taiwan). These two cell lines had been tested and
authenticated (including isoenzyme analysis, Mycoplasma
test, cytogenetics test, tumorigenic test and receptor
expression test) by BCRC. We purchased them from BCRC
and passaged in our laboratory for fewer than 6 months after
thawing and maintained for further study in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10%
FBS and incubation conditions are 5% CO2 at 37°C. Before
the study, cells were placed in 0.25% hormone-depleted
serum–supplemented medium for 2 days.

Figure 8: Signal transduction pathways involved in resveratrol-induced apoptosis and in inhibitory effects of DHT on
actions of resveratrol in ER-α-positive and negative breast cancer cells. DHT binds to membrane ER-α in ER-α-postive breast

cancer cells and integrin αvβ3 in ER-α-negative breast cancer cells. DHT activates ERK1/2 and induces cell proliferation. Resveratrol
binds to integrin αvβ3 activates ERK1/2, which is essential for resveratrol-induced expression of COX-2. The newly synthesized COX-2 is
associated with phosphoERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus where the complex binds to p53, in the course of which COX-2 is sumoylated and
p53 is phosphorylated and acetylated. The COX-2 and p53 complex binds to promoters of p53-responsive genes and initiates transcription.
The activation of ERK1/2 by resveratrol and DHT are separate processes that do not interferewith each other.However, the activation of
ERK1/2 by nonpeptide hormones is essential to the inhibition of apoptosis induced by resveratrol. DHT inhibits resveratrol-induced cellular
activities as indicated. P, phosphorylation.

anti-integrin αvβ3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) for 24 hr prior to the treatment of
either resveratrol, DHT or the combination for another
24 hr. The samples were immediately fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
for 10 minutes. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 20 minutes. The cells on the slides were
incubated with anti-phosphoPI3K antibody or anti-pSer15-p53 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers,
MA, USA) overnight in 4°C. Then the cells were incubated
with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanante (TRITC)conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,
United Kingdom) and a Hoechst stain for nucleus. The
red fluorescent signals from phosphoPI3K and phosphoSer15-p53 were recorded and analyzed with TCS SP5

(10 μg/mL), pepstatin A (10 μg/mL), NaF (50  mM),
0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate and trichostatin A (5 μM;
Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA). Cell lysates were
sonicated to yield chromatin fragments of approximately
200 - 500 bps, as determined by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis. Sonicated lysates were then diluted to
2 mL with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS; 1.1% Triton
X-100; 1.2 mM EDTA; 16.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; and
167 mM NaCl), followed by preclearing with 80 μL
protein A–agarose beads/protein G Plus–agarose beads
for 60 minutes at 4°C with rotation. 50  μL precleared
lysates of each experiment were removed and then
extracted DNA as INPUT DNA. The precleared lysates
were next immunoprecipitated using antibodies for
COX-2 (4 μg; Abcam) at 4°C overnight with rotation.
The no-antibody control was also included with each
experiment. Immune complexes were collected with
60 μL protein A–agarose/protein G Plus–agarose and
washed once with 1 mL each of the following buffers:
low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS; 1% Triton X-100;
2  mM EDTA; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; and 150 mM
NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1%  SDS; 1% Triton
X-100; 2 mM EDTA; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH  8.0; and
1500 mM NaCl); and twice with 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA. Immune complexes were next
eluted using freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS
and 0.1  M NaHCO3). Cross-links were reversed by
heating at 65°C in the presence of NaCl followed by
proteinase K treatment. The DNA was recovered by
PCR-purification spin column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
A total of 6 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed
to 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to
effect crosslinking and then added glycine to a final
concentration of 125 mM for 5 min to stop crosslinking.
Monolayers were washed twice with cold PBS and cell
extracts prepared by scraping cells in 1 mL of buffer
(150  mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS,
50 mM Tris [pH 8], 5 mM EDTA) containing leupeptin

were performed as described previously [44, 45]. We also
performed PCR and the PCR product was resolved using
2.5% agarose gels in 0.5X Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Gels
were stained with SYBR Safe (Thermo Fisher Scientific

according to the ΔΔCT method. Fidelity of the PCR
reaction was determined by melting temperature analysis.

Apoptosis/nucleosomes
Cells were treated with different reagents for
48 h. The cells were harvested, spun down and pellets
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline.
Pelleted cells were then lysed and the supernatants were
collected and stored for at least 18 h at −20°C. From
each appropriately diluted sample, 100 μl were added
to a 96-well plate coated with a DNA binding protein
and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. After three
washes with buffer, detector antibody was added for 1 h.
Streptavidin conjugate was then added and incubated for
0.5 h before adding substrate. Plates were read at 450 nm.
The nucleosome ELISA kits for these studies were
purchased from Calbiochem.

Quantitative real-time PCR
To examine mRNA expression, we treated
MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells with vehicle,
10−9 M DHT, 10 μM resveratrol or combined treatments
for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted and genomic DNA was
also eliminated with illustra RNAspin Mini RNA Isolation
Kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire,
United Kingdom). 1 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA was
reverse-transcribed with RevertAid H Minus First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies Corporation,
Carlsbad, California, USA) into cDNA, and used as the
template for real-time PCR reactions and analysis. The real
time PCR reactions were performed using QuantiNovaTM
SYBR® Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN) on CFX Connect™ RealTime PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.,
Hercules, CA, USA). This involved an initial denaturation
at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at

Cell viability assay
MCF-7 cells (5 × 103 cells per well) were seeded
in 96-well plates. After starvation with serum-freem
medium for 48 h, cells were then treated with vechicle,
10 μM RV, 10−10M, 10−9M, 10−8M DHT or combined
treatment for 96 hr. Cell proliferation was determined
by incubating the cells with 200 μl of fresh medium
containing 1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 4 h at 37°C. After removal of the MTT solution, the
resulting formazan crystals were dissolved completely
in dimethyl sulfoxide and the plates were read using a
microplate reader (Anthos 2010; Biochrom, Cambridge,
United Kingdom) by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm.
Quintuplicate wells were assayed for each experiment and
three independent experiments were performed. Data are
expressed as the mean ratio (%) of OD540 ± SD which
