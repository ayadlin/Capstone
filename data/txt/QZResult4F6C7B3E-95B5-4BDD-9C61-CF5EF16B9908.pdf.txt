Abstract
Although it is generally acknowledged that cytokines regulate normal hematopoiesis in an autocrine/paracrine
fashion, their possible role in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and resistance to imatinib mesylate treatment
remain poorly investigated. Here, we report that CD34(þ) progenitors from patients with CML at diagnosis are
selectively targeted by the cytokine/alarmin interleukin (IL)-33. Indeed, CML CD34(þ) progenitors upregulate their
cell surface expression of the IL-33–speciﬁc receptor chain ST2, proliferate and produce cytokines in response to IL33, conversely to CD34(þ) cells from healthy individuals. Moreover, ST2 overexpression is normalized following
imatinib mesylate therapy, whereas IL-33 counteracts in vitro imatinib mesylate-induced growth arrest in CML
CD34(þ) progenitors via reactivation of the STAT5 pathway, thus supporting the notion that IL-33 may impede the
antiproliferative effects of imatinib mesylate on CD34(þ) progenitors in CML. Clinically, the levels of circulating
soluble ST2, commonly considered a functional signature of IL-33 signaling in vivo, correlate with disease burden.
Indeed, these elevated peripheral concentrations associated with a high Sokal score predictive of therapeutic
outcome are normalized in patients in molecular remission. Finally, we evidenced a facilitating effect of IL-33 on in
vivo maintenance of CD34(þ) progenitors from patients with CML by using xenotransplant experiments in
immunodeﬁcient NOG mice, and we showed that engraftment of mouse BCR-ABL–transfected bone marrow
progenitors was less efﬁcient in IL-33–deﬁcient mice compared with wild-type recipients. Taken together, our
results provide evidence that IL-33/ST2 signaling may represent a novel cytokine-mediated mechanism contributing to CML progenitor growth and support a role for this pathway in CML maintenance and imatinib mesylate
resistance. Cancer Res; 74(10); 2669–76. 2014 AACR.

protein, which gives rise to deregulated tyrosine kinase (TK)
activity in all leukemic cells (1). Imatinib mesylate, a competitive inhibitor of the BCR-ABL TK activity, is currently used as a
ﬁrst-line therapy of CML (2). Because around 20% of patients
develop resistance against imatinib mesylate (2), breaking this
resistance remains an important issue for the therapeutic
success of this treatment.
A critical role of the environment in the development and
control of CML is supported by several reports (3–6). Although
leukemic progenitors are believed to reside in a milieu enriched
in cytokines, few studies have actually addressed their effects
on CD34(þ) progenitor functions in patients with CML, apart
from the evidence for their capacity to resist imatinib mesylate–induced apoptosis (3–5).
The recently identiﬁed interleukin (IL)-33 is the ligand of
ST2, a long-known orphan member of the IL-1 receptor superfamily (7). Since its ﬁrst description, important roles have been
ascribed to IL-33, both as a conventional cytokine and as an
alarmin, implicated in a number of pathologies (8, 9). Knowing
that endothelial cells and osteoblasts (9, 10), two components
of the hematopoietic stem cell niche, are the main sources of
IL-33, while several immune/hematopoietic cells, including

primary progenitors (11), constitute its natural targets, we
hypothesized that IL-33 might enhance proliferation and/or
mediate imatinib mesylate resistance in CML CD34(þ) cells.
We found that the IL-33 receptor ST2 was constitutively
expressed and was functional in leukemic CD34(þ) cells
because it mediated the proliferation and cytokine production
induced by IL-33, whereas CD34(þ) cells from healthy donors
(HD) neither expressed ST2 nor responded to IL-33. Based on
these ﬁndings, we further investigated the relationship
between BCR-ABL expression and responsiveness to IL-33 as
well as its relevance to imatinib mesylate resistance.

Patients and Methods
Patient samples
Twenty-two patients with CML in chronic phase at diagnosis (CML-CP) and sixteen patients with CML currently treated
with imatinib mesylate who have achieved major molecular
remission [MMR-IM or BCR-ABL/ABL (IS) 0.1%; OncologyHematology Department, Poitiers, France] were included in
this study. All patients gave informed consent in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki for participation in the study
that was approved by the scientiﬁc committee of the INSERMCIC1402 (Poitiers, France). The 15 healthy individuals were
volunteers from the P^
ole Biologie Sante (Poitiers, France).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated
from blood samples collected on heparin from patients with
CML or healthy donors mobilized with granulocyte colony–
stimulating factor (G-CSF), and CD34(þ) cells were further
puriﬁed using an immunomagnetic cell sorting system (Miltenyi Biotech). Purity was generally above 95% upon reanalysis.
Mice
Six- to 9-week-old female wild-type (Janvier) and IL-33–
deﬁcient C57BL/6 mice (12), and NOG mice (IGR) were maintained in our animal facilities under speciﬁc pathogen-free
conditions. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care
Use Committee of Poitou-Charentes (CEEA, n CE2012–018).
Engraftment of human cells in immunodeﬁcient mice
Enriched primary CD34(þ) cells (1  106) from patient
with CML-CP were incubated in serum-free expansion medium (Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 200
pg/mL), stem cell factor (SCF; 200 pg/mL), G-CSF (1 ng/mL),
and IL-6 (1 ng/mL) and with or without IL-33. After 3 days,
recovered cells (5  106) were transplanted intravenously
into NOG mice.
Retroviral mouse model of BCR-ABL CML-like syndrome
The retroviral vector MIGR-p210-BCR-ABL as well as the
methodologic details of the murine bone marrow retroviral
transduction and transplantation model of CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm have been described in detail elsewhere (13).
Cell cultures
CD34(þ) cell cultures were performed in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum

2670

and antibiotics. Enriched primary CD34(þ) cells from patients
with CML-CP or healthy donors were seeded into 96-well
round (U)-bottom culture plates (2.5  104 per well) and
incubated with the indicated compound(s).
In vitro treatment with cytokines and inhibitors
Human IL-33 (50 ng/mL), neutralizing anti-human GMCSF monoclonal antibody (mAb; 1 mg/mL), and anti-human
ST2 mAb (1 mg/mL), and SCF (50 ng/mL) were purchased
from R&D Systems and Peprotech, respectively. AG490 (0.05
mmol/L) was purchased from Calbiochem. Imatinib mesylate
(Glivec, Novartis) was used at 1 to 2.5 mmol/L depending on
the time of exposure.
CFC assays
After a 3-day liquid-phase culture of CD34(þ) cells with or
without IL-33, remaining cells were harvested and seeded (1 
103/25-mm dish) in methyl-cellulose supplemented with cytokines (MethoCult H4434, Stem Cell Technologies), and emerging colonies were counted 14 days later.
ELISA and Luminex
Luminex technology was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to measure GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8 in
culture supernatants (R&D Systems) and phosphoproteins in
cell lysates (Millipore). Soluble ST2 levels were quantiﬁed in
plasma by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Cell proliferation
For the quantiﬁcation of CD34(þ) cell proliferation, a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) colorimetric cell proliferation
immunoassay was used (Roche). An 18-hour pulse with BrdUrd
was performed, and BrdUrd incorporation was quantiﬁed by
measuring the absorbance (O.D.), as recommended by the
manufacturer.
FACS analysis
CD34(þ) cells were stained with the following antibodies:
anti-CD34-PE-Cy7, anti-CD38-FITC, and anti-p-STAT5-Alexa
Fluor 647 (all from BD Biosciences), and anti-ST2-PE mAbs
(R&D Systems). Membrane labeling as well as intracellular
p-STAT5 staining were performed as previously described
(3). A minimum of 1  103 viable cell events were acquired
in the population of interest. For the quantiﬁcation of
apoptosis, CD34(þ) cells were resuspended at room temperature for 15 minutes with Annexin V-FITC and 7-aminoactinomycin D (both from BD Biosciences) and then
analyzed immediately. Cells were analyzed by six-color
ﬂow cytometry (FACSCanto II, FACSVerse, and FacsDiva
software, BD Biosciences), and data were reanalyzed with
FlowJo Software (Tree Star). Positive staining for
each marker was determined by comparison with appropriate isotype-matched negative controls.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses used Prism 5 (GraphPad software
Inc.). The statistical signiﬁcance of differences in mean values
was analyzed by the two-tailed Mann–Whitney nonparametric

be statistically signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

Results and Discussion
The kinase activity of BCR-ABL upregulates ST2 cell
surface expression on CD34(þ) cells from patients with
CML-CP and UT-7 cells
IL-33 mediates its biologic effects by stimulating the heterodimeric receptor ST2/IL-1RAcP (7). Knowing that IL-1RAcP is
upregulated in primitive CML-CP CD34(þ) cells (personal
data; ref. 14), we ﬁrst addressed the question whether this
applied likewise to its coreceptor ST2. Flow-cytometric analysis revealed substantial ST2 expression on gated CD34(þ)
PBMCs from most patients with CML-CP examined, conversely to those recovered from healthy donors, which displayed this
receptor at very low or undetectable levels (Fig. 1A and B).
Importantly, both hematopoietic stem cell-enriched CD34(þ)
CD38() and CD34(þ)CD38(þ) subsets harbored ST2 contrasting to their counterparts from healthy donors (Fig. 1C). In
accordance with a possible contribution of BCR-ABL TK
activity to ST2 upregulation, we observed a remarkable reversal

www.aacrjournals.org

of ST2 overexpression, back to healthy donor levels, in patients
having achieved MMR with imatinib mesylate therapy (Fig. 1A
and B) as well as among gated CD34(þ) PBMCs from patients
with CML-CP after a 4-hour incubation with imatinib mesylate
(Fig. 1D).
To conﬁrm that ST2 could be induced as a corollary of
oncogene expression, we transduced UT-7 cells with a retrovirus encoding BCR-ABL or with an empty control and found
that ST2 was effectively upregulated on the surface of these
transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Conversely, exposure to imatinib mesylate led to a signiﬁcant downregulation
of ST2 on BCR-ABL–transduced UT-7 cells but not on their
imatinib mesylate-resistant mutant T315I BCR-ABL-transduced controls (Supplementary Fig. S1B; ref. 15). Taken together, these ﬁndings show that CML-CP CD34(þ) cells overexpress ST2 receptors and designate BCR-ABL TK activity as a
plausible mechanism of upregulation.
CD34(þ) cells from patients with CML-CP proliferate and
produce cytokines in response to IL-33
The constitutive expression of ST2 and IL-1RAcP by
CML-CP CD34(þ) cells implied that IL-33 could exert a
function in these cells. In support of this notion, the viable
cell recovery after 3 days of liquid-phase culture with IL-33

was higher among enriched primary CD34(þ) cells from
patients with CML-CP than from healthy donors (Supplementary Fig. S2A), raising the question whether IL-33
behaved like a survival and/or proliferative factor for
CML-CP CD34(þ) cells. Annexin V expression in CML-CP
CD34(þ) cells was not modiﬁed in these conditions, indicating that apoptosis was not controlled by IL-33 (Supplementary Fig. S3). In keeping with a growth-promoting
function, CML-CP CD34(þ) cells were signiﬁcantly
increased (Supplementary Fig. S2) and incorporated twice
as much BrdUrd upon exposure to IL-33 than their normal
counterparts (Fig. 2A). More than 90% of IL-33–induced
proliferation of CML-CP CD34(þ) was prevented by neutralizing antibodies against ST2, thereby conﬁrming that IL33 exerts its action in these cells via its speciﬁc receptor
(Supplementary Fig. S2D). The cytokine/alarmin was as
efﬁcient as SCF, which is the only growth factor known so
far for its capacity to induce, as a single agent, the selective
proliferation of CML-CP CD34(þ) cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4; ref. 16). Taken together, our results demonstrate that
CD34(þ) cells from patients with CML-CP express ST2 and

2672

Cancer Res; 74(10) May 15, 2014

respond to IL-33, whereas their counterpart from healthy
individuals does neither. Hence, it can be assumed that by
targeting CD34(þ) cells from patients with CML-CP, IL-33
behaves like a hematopoietic growth factor.
The human hematopoietic cell population deﬁned by CD34
expression is heterogeneous, with only a small fraction of
cells (1%–10%) containing virtually all the in vitro clonogenic
potential, and a large percentage of more mature cells.
Accordingly, even though hematopoietic stem cell-enriched
CD34(þ)CD38() and CD34(þ)CD38(þ) subsets both express
ST2, the speciﬁc target of IL-33 in terms of expansion remains
to be identiﬁed. However, the fact that the CML-CP CD34(þ)
cell population retained its overall in vitro clonogenic potential on a per cell basis, once it had proliferated in response to
IL-33 (Fig. 2B), supports the conclusion that both clonogenic
and more mature CD34(þ) cells from patients with CML-CP
respond to IL-33. The selective reactivity of CML-CP CD34(þ)
cells was further evidenced by cytokine production (Fig. 2C)
because they secreted more GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8 in
response to IL-33 than normal CD34(þ) cells, for which
cytokine production was almost undetectable.

The ST2/IL-33 Axis in CML

(2) can be substantially ampliﬁed by IL-33. As to the molecular
events involved, STAT5, a signaling component acknowledged
as a common antiapoptotic and transforming target of BCRABL (18), would be a likely candidate. Evidence of its involvement was obtained from both a multiplex assay of phosphorylated signaling proteins and intracellular ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Fig. 3C) showing that IL-33
partially restored STAT5 activity in leukemic CD34(þ) cells,
thus overcoming the inhibitory effect of imatinib mesylate.
That JAK2 is also involved in this recovery is suggested by the
complete loss of IL-33–induced proliferation in the presence
of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 (Fig. 3D). In this regard, although
GM-CSF is known to play an important role in TK inhibitor
resistance by engaging the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (3, 4), only
10% to 15% of IL-33–induced proliferation of CML-CP CD34(þ)

IL-33 overcomes imatinib mesylate-induced inhibition
of CML-CP CD34(þ) cell proliferation by engaging the
JAK2/STAT5 pathway
We next addressed the question whether IL-33–induced
proliferation of CML-CP CD34(þ) cells was maintained upon
treatment with a therapeutic dose of 1 mmol/L (17) of imatinib
mesylate, which induces a strong inhibition of cell proliferation. As illustrated in Fig. 3A and B, IL-33 counteracted the
inhibitory effect of imatinib mesylate on both proliferation and
cytokine production, revealing that in the presence of IL-33,
even a marked inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity cannot
totally block CML-CP CD34(þ) progenitor functions. From
these ﬁndings, it can be surmised that the residual BCR-ABL–
dependent pathways in leukemic CD34(þ) cells that persist

were cultured for 96 hours with or without IL-33 (50 ng/mL) and transplanted (5  10 cells/mouse) into sublethally irradiated (3 Gy) NOG mice. Mice
were euthanized after 4 weeks, and marrow contents were obtained. A, graphs showing human cell engraftment in bone marrow assessed by labeling with
anti-human CD45-PercP-Cy5.5 antibody (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Wilcoxon nonparametric test. B, speciﬁc cell subsets were
detected by using antibodies to human CD33-PE, CD11b-PE, CD3-FITC, and CD19-APC (all from BD Biosciences). C and D, comparison of leukemic
cell engraftment and disease-free survival between wild-type and IL-33–deﬁcient mice receiving p210-BCR-ABL–transduced bone marrow cells. Donor wildtype mice were injected with 5-ﬂuorouracil (150 mg/kg). After 4 days, mice were sacriﬁced, and enriched bone marrow cells were isolated and transduced with
a retrovirus encoding GFP linked by an IRES sequence to BCR-ABL (MIGR-p210-BCR-ABL-GFP). After two rounds of infection, GFP(þ)-transduced bone
5
marrow cells (1.10 ) were transplanted into lethally irradiated (9.5 Gy) wild-type or IL-33–deﬁcient mice. C, elevated counts (20%–80%) of circulating
leukocytes expressing GFP (coexpressed from the BCR-ABL–carrying retrovirus) were evidenced in all wild-type recipients (n ¼ 10) as early as 12 days
posttransplantation, in clear contrast with the low counts (<2%) of GFP(þ) leukocytes (P < 0.05, Fisher exact test) recovered in four out of 10 IL-33–deﬁcient
recipients on the same time point. A representative experiment out of two is shown. The dotted line separates engrafted from nonengrafted mice. D, Kaplan–
Meier survival curves for wild-type (n ¼ 16) or IL-33–deﬁcient (n ¼ 15) recipients of p210-BCR-ABL–transduced bone marrow cells. Disease-free
survival was prolonged in IL-33–deﬁcient animals, whereas all wild-type mice succumbed to a CML-like syndrome (see Supplementary Fig. S7) between
3 weeks and 4 weeks after transplantation. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the numbers of alive versus dead mice in the wild-type group
with those in the IL-33–deﬁcient group (P < 0.05). Combined data from two separate experiments out of three are shown.

was prevented by neutralizing antibodies against GM-CSF
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Together, these data are consistent
with the involvement of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (19) operating independently from GM-CSF. They reveal a new mechanism of cytokine-mediated imatinib mesylate resistance
through IL-33–induced leukemic CD34(þ) cell proliferation.
ST2 upregulation correlates with disease burden
Clinically, high circulating levels of IL-33 were detected only
in 3 patients out of 15 analyzed. However, because it is
commonly acknowledged that a reliable detection of the
secreted form of this cytokine is difﬁcult, we assessed instead
the levels of soluble ST2 (sST2), which may act as a quencher of
IL-33 and is regarded as a functional signature of IL-33
signaling in vivo (20). Indeed, high amounts of circulating sST2
were detected in the plasma from patients with CML-CP (mean
 SEM: 678.1  121.4 pg/mL), whereas low/undetectable levels

2674

were measured in healthy donors (mean  SEM: 75.5  15.2
pg/mL) and MMR-IM patients (mean  SEM: 74.1  17.4 pg/mL;
Supplementary Fig. S6A). Interestingly, circulating sST2
levels were highest among patients with high Sokal risk score,
which is predictive of therapeutic outcome (Supplementary
Fig. S6B). This ﬁnding, together with the reduction of circulating sST2 in patients in molecular remission (Supplementary
Fig. S6A), establishes a relationship with clinical stages and
outcomes. Finally, even though high amounts of peripheral
sST2 are probably in part a consequence of increased leukemic cell mass, we provide evidence that IL-33 contributes to
the proliferation and maintenance of BCR-ABL cells. Supporting this conclusion, we also evidenced an effect of IL-33 on
in vivo maintenance of CD34(þ) progenitors from patients
with CML by using xenotransplant experiments in immunodeﬁcient NOG mice. In comparison with their untreated counterparts, CML CD34(þ) cells cultured with IL-33 demonstrated

The ST2/IL-33 Axis in CML

signiﬁcantly increased engraftment in bone marrow of NOG
mice at 4 weeks after transplantation (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S7A), which was associated with an unmodiﬁed cell
distribution, as revealed by the same proportion of CD33and/or CD11b-expressing myeloid cells in treated and untreated CD34(þ) progenitors (Fig. 4B). These results extend our
ex vivo data and demonstrate a facilitating effect of IL-33 on
in vivo maintenance of CD34(þ) progenitors from patients with
CML. Finally, taking advantage of the availability of IL-33–
deﬁcient mice (12), which were used as recipients in a retroviral
BCR-ABL transduction–transplantation model of CML-like
syndrome (13), we were able to address the impact of endogenous IL-33 on CML development in vivo. As expected, 12 days
after transplantation of a high dose of mouse BCR-ABL-GFP–
transfected bone marrow progenitors, an elevated proportion
(20%–80%) of circulating CML leukocytes was evidenced in
all wild-type recipients (n ¼ 10; Fig. 4C and Supplementary
Fig. S7B). This clearly contrasted with the low proportion
(<2%) of CML circulating leucocytes recovered in four out of
10 IL-33–deﬁcient recipients analyzed in the same experimental setting. Accordingly, although all wild-type mice succumbed to BCR-ABL–induced CML-like syndrome after 3 to 4 weeks,
overall survival was signiﬁcantly prolonged in the IL-33–deﬁcient mice (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S7C). Hence, we
propose that IL-33 facilitates the development of leukemia by
inducing and/or enhancing the proliferation of hematopoietic
progenitors, including probably stem cells, in the bone marrow
microenvironment from patients with CML-CP.
Recent studies provide deﬁnite evidence for the kinase
activity of BCR-ABL in CML stem cells and for its inhibition
by imatinib mesylate without affecting their survival (5). Here,
we show that despite the addition of imatinib mesylate at a
therapeutically effective dose of 1 mmol/L that blocks TK
activity, CML progenitor cells maintain their proliferative
response to IL-33. Hence, it might be argued that IL-33, as a
component of the microenvironment, may also contribute to
the loss of oncogene "addiction" of leukemic stem cells thereby
rendering them resistant to imatinib mesylate treatment.
Further experimental studies in mice are needed to determine
whether in vivo IL-33 is capable of opposing the action of
imatinib mesylate on BCR-ABL(þ) progenitors in vivo.

In conclusion, our ﬁndings demonstrate that IL-33 is capable of sustaining constitutive proliferation as well as cytokine
production in leukemic progenitors of patients with CML, and
support the hypothesis that the IL-33/ST2 pathway is involved
in the control of leukemic cell fate. They also provide an
explanation for the selective targeting of CML-CP progenitor
cells by IL-33, a feature that is not shared by other hematopoietic factors that cannot discriminate between normal and
CML-CP progenitor cells. It remains to determine whether
selective targeting of CML progenitors expressing ST2 would
be a new useful therapeutic approach.
