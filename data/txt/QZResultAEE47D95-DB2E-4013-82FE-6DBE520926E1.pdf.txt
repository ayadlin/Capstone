BACKGROUND. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor widely used for the
treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Studies reported the occurrence

Ph-positive clone. These abnormalities were described in a relatively high proportion of patients treated with imatinib compared with the anecdotal reports of
similar cases in patients treated with other drugs. However, the origin of these
abnormalities as well as their biological and clinical significance are unknown.

METHODS. The study involved 13 cases of patients diagnosed with CML carrying
cytogenetic abnormalities in their Ph-negative cell population after imatinib
treatment. The presence of the markers within the CD341 stem cell compart-

normal growth in all but 1 patient. No growth advantage was demonstrated for
the Ph-negative or the Ph-positive clone after cell culture.

evolved to myelodysplasia or acute leukemia. Hypothesis regarding the biological

leukemia (CML).1,2 Targeting the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL
to block the pathogenetic mechanism of the disease is an appealing
therapeutic strategy, which became reality with the recent introduction of imatinib (Glivec; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ). Imatinib mesylate is a 2-phenaminopyrimidine derivative that specifically inhibits
the abl tyrosine kinase blocking the proliferation of CML colonyforming units granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and suppressing
proliferation of cell lines expressing p210 BCR-ABL.3,4

acute myeloid leukemia (AML), have recently been
reported in patients treated with imatinib.7,8
We report our experience in 13 patients in
chronic phase CML who developed cytogenetic
abnormalities in Ph-negative cells while receiving
imatinib. To acquire insight into the origin of the Phnegative clone as well as the clinical evolution of the
coexisting Ph and Ph1 cell populations, we analyzed bone marrow (BM) cell segregation, cell culture, angiogenesis, and followed the patients for up
to 4 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Since April 2000 we have treated 122 CML patients in
different phases of the disease with imatinib. In 13
patients the emergence of a cytogenetic abnormal
clone in Ph-negative cells was seen after a median of
17.6 months (range, 5–39 months) since beginning

imatinib. Ten patients began imatinib therapy in
chronic phase for interferon intolerance, whereas 3
patients were treated with imatinib at diagnosis.
The median age was 54.7 years, the female:male ratio
was 7:6, and the median time from CML diagnosis
was 42 months. None of the patients had ever progressed to accelerated or blastic phase before or after
imatinib treatment. Previous treatments included
hydroxyurea (HU), 6-mercaptopurine (PU), busulfan
(BU), Ara-C (AC), and interferon (IFN). Two patients
underwent stem cell harvest after mini-ICE therapy
and 1 patient had received an autologous BM transplant.
Karyotypes at CML onset and after starting
imatinib were characterized in all patients by the
presence of the Ph chromosome. No additional abnormalities were detected except for a dup(1q)(q11q21)
in 1 patient. All patients responded to imatinib
obtaining CHR, with 3 minor, 3 major, and 7 CCR

when additional abnormalities were noticed in
Ph-negative cells. After patients gave their informed
consent, samples for further analyses were collected.

Cytogenetic and Molecular Analyses
Complete karyotyping was performed on all patients
at diagnosis, repeated at 3-month to 12-month intervals, with a minimum of 20 metaphases analyzed.
Standard overnight or 24-hour to 72-hour unstimulated BM cultures were used and the results reported
according to the International System for Human
Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN 1995). Slides for
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis
were prepared following the manufacturer’s protocols. Interphase FISH analysis was performed on
200–500 nuclei. A conservative threshold of 7% (2
standard deviations [SD]) was considered for interphase FISH results.
Cell Separation/Cell Culture
Mononucleated BM cells were obtained by FicollHypaque density gradient centrifugation and separated into CD341 and CD34-negative subsets using
an immunomagnetic cell sorting device (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The purity of
CD341 cells ranged from 92% to 98% in all samples
as determined by flow cytometry.
Progenitor cell cultures were performed using a
complete pretested mixture of methylcellulose, fetal
bovine serum, bovine serum albumin, rh-SCF, rh-IL3,
rh-GM-CSF, and rh-erythropoietin in Iscove medium
(methocult H4434, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Mononucleated cells and CD341
enriched cells were analyzed for colony-forming
capacity by plating in duplicate in 35-mm Petri
dishes at 2 different cell concentrations (5–10 3 104/
mL and 0.3–1 3 104). Dishes were incubated at 378C
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and
scored after 14 days for the presence of colonies
(CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-MIXED).
Peripheral Blood and BM Analysis
Complete blood counts (CBC) and peripheral blood
(PB) smears on these 13 patients were carefully evaluated, with particular regard to cell morphology,
white blood cell differential, presence of myeloid precursors, and blasts. BM aspirates and biopsies were
evaluated for cellularity, trilineage maturation, dysplastic changes, blast percentage, and vessel area
extension for angiogenesis, the latter using CD34
monoclonal antibody employed according to the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) methods with
diaminobenzidine (DAB) as final chromogen and hematoxylin as counterstain (34).

FISH analysis (bcr-abl [Cancer Genetics, River
Vale, NJ]; LSI-EGFR-CEP7, LSIc-myc, and CEPX/Y
[Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill]) confirmed the presence
of the additional abnormalities that were noticed
only on Ph-negative cells (Fig. 1B). Ph-negative
abnormal cells showed the presence of 2 red signals
on chromosomes 9 and 2 green signals on chromosomes 22, thus excluding the possibility of deletion
of Ph as a secondary clonal evolution of CML Ph1
cells (Fig. 1A).
Two to 4 previous samples per patient, and also
1 sample pre-imatinib from archived material, were
retrospectively analyzed using FISH in patients presenting 18, 7, del(7), or Y, revealing no hidden
abnormalities.
Cytogenetics and FISH were repeated in 12
patients and the abnormalities confirmed, whereas
Patient 3 had a matched donor and was transplanted. Patients who lost cytogenetic response
showed that the percentage of the Ph1 cells inversely correlated with the abnormal clone. The patient
that became 100% Ph1 cleared the BM from the 18
clone. Patient 13 showed the emergence of the del(7)
clone while receiving imatinib; this additional abnormality disappeared when he lost the partial cytogenetic remission. The patient was then given dasatinib
(BMS354825, Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), a
second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and, after 3 months of treatment, at the time of reduction

of Ph1 clone, the del(7) abnormality reappeared,
being still present, after 12 months treatment and a
CCR. In addition, Patient 2 was treated with dasatinib after failing imatinib, achieving partial cytogenetic response, but in this case the 18 clone was not
further evidenced. The patient with dup(1q) maintained 100% duplicated metaphases while clearing
the BM of Ph-positive cells (constitutional karyotype
was normal), suggesting the emergence of the Ph1
leukemic clone out of a preexisting clonal background. Furthermore, patients expressing Y as an
abnormality presented with a normal constitutional
karyotype, thus excluding the common loss evidenced in some elderly males.
In 4 patients the abnormal clone was not evidenced in all the subsequent controls, even after a
long time interval (up to 40 months), suggesting the
possibility that the abnormalities could be temporary.

Cultured/Separated Cells
Of 6 patients, 5 showed a normal cultured cell
growth; only 1 (Patient 6) had an abnormal growth
pattern as demonstrated with reduced CFU formation affecting BFU-Es, CFU-GM, and CFU-MIXED,
and colony size microclusters on both mononucleated and CD341 cell culture (Table 3).
FISH analyses on separated CD341 and CD34negative cells showed that the abnormal clone was
present in the CD341 compartment, suggesting the
involvement of stem cells at this level (Table 4). FISH
on cultured cells did not demonstrate a growth
advantage for Ph1 cells or for the new clone (data
not shown).

Peripheral Blood/Bone Marrow Morphology
CBC and PB findings were within the normal range.
BM presented with reduced cellularity, normal differential, and mild dysplastic signs as seen in patients
under imatinib. No significant morphologic changes
were observed during the follow-up. BM biopsies in
3 patients showed mild megakaryocytic dysplasia
and reduced cellularity. No fibrosis or increased
angiogenesis (Fig. 2) were observed.

DISCUSSION
The introduction of imatinib has represented a major
advance leading to substantial clinical and quality of
life improvement in CML patients. However, several
articles have drawn attention to the occurrence of
clonal karyotypic abnormalities in Ph-negative cells
after imatinib-induced cytogenetic response,9–11
although the origin of these abnormalities as well as
their clinical significance are unclear. Earlier
reports12 have suggested the possibility that residual
Ph-negative stem cells damaged by previous treatments may emerge when the Ph1 clone’s proliferative advantage has been abrogated by imatinib.
Recently, Terre et al.13 reported a larger series of 34
patients in which retrospective FISH analysis was
performed in 15 patients showing the presence of
the abnormalities in pre-imatinib samples in 4 of 15
patients. In our series, all patients were analyzed in
multiple previous BM samples by FISH, using a conservative threshold of 7% to avoid the risk of falsepositive results. The absence of cytogenetic abnormalities and the presence in the current series of 3
previously untreated patients suggests a different
mechanism.14,15
To our knowledge, few cases of cytogenetic clonal
abnormalities in Ph-negative cells after interferon
treatment and development of Ph leukemias after

CML have been described,16–18 as well as cases in
which Ph and Ph1 myeloproliferative disorders
coexist.19 An alternative hypothesis to explain these
findings could be that the BCR-ABL fusion may not
represent the initial event in the pathogenesis of
CML. This multistep hypothesis implies that the Ph
chromosome is a late event that determines the clinical onset of overt CML and controls the evolution of
the illness.20 Through the reduction/elimination of
the Ph1 clone, the ‘very first’ aberrant stem cell can
expand in the BM and eventually acquire new cytogenetic abnormalities to, potentially, escape the control
of the drug. In our study it appears that the percentage of the Ph-negative aberrant cells is inversely proportional to the Ph1 clone, suggesting the presence

Ph-Negative Abnormal Clones in CML/Abruzzese et al.

of 2 distinct cell populations in which the Ph1 clone
most likely retains the proliferative advantage.
What is the clinical meaning of these cytogenetic
alterations? At the time of last follow-up, the majority
of our patients had been followed for more than
3 years (median follow-up, 34.6 months) and in none
had their disease evolved to MDS or acute leukemia.
Patients developing secondary MDS-AML, instead,
once cytogenetic abnormalities are evidenced, usually rapidly develop frank MDS-AML symptoms21;
the few cases described that evolved in MDS22–24 are
thus probably related to a non-CML stem cell
damage due to previous treatments.
Furthermore, other biological features of MDS
have been studied in our patients (eg, cell culture
growth, BM morphology), with particular regard to
the presence and distribution of blast cells, and
angiogenesis modification to reveal preclinical dysplastic manifestations.
Patients with MDS usually present with reduced
growth of colonies/clusters or excessive growth (CFUGM, CFU-MIXED, BFU-E), and the latter has resulted
in an independent predictive value for leukemic evolution.25,26 In addition, a dose-dependent growth inhibition of normal CD341 progenitors tested in vivo
after imatinib exposure has been reported.27
In the currentr series, BM morphology and cell
culture studies disclosed apparently normal findings,
except for 1 patient who showed abnormal colony
formation.28 However, after 48 months of follow-up
this patient was still receiving imatinib, with a normal CBC and differential, histologically normal BM,
and a recently achieved CCR.
Increased BM angiogenesis has been assessed in
different hematologic malignancies including CML and
MDS through analysis of BM microvessel density
(MVD).29,30 None of our patients presented with
increased MVD as estimated by CD34 immunohistochemical expression in BM biopsies, confirming the
clinical feature of hematologic remission from CML and
the absence of clinical and morphologic signs of MDS.
To our knowledge the current study is one of the
largest series reported of patients with CML and clonal Ph-negative cytogenetic abnormalities followed
over time.31 The 10% incidence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities in Ph-negative cells in CML
patients receiving imatinib is confirmed in our series
and may represent an emerging problem.32 Furthermore, this number could be underestimated because
CML screening is often performed using FISH only.
Although a longer follow-up observation and laboratory analyses are required to draw firm conclusions,
we note that after up to 49 months follow-up the Phnegative abnormal clone did not tend in our patients

2471

to evolve into MDS-AML, nor seems to be associated
with CML clonal evolution and disease progression.
Furthermore, in 4 patients the aberration was transient, suggesting the possibility of clearance of the
aberrant clone over time while receiving treatment.
A registry collecting clinical and biological data
regarding CML patients with Ph-negative abnormal
clones has been set through the Italian GIMEMA
Working Party in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and the
European Leukemia Network. We expect that prolonged observation of patients as well as collection
of relevant clinical and laboratory findings in a larger
series of cases may greatly improve our understanding of this still unclear phenomenon in terms of its
biological or clinical significance.
