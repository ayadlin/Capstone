Abstract
Cancer cells are markedly different from normal cells with regards to how their metabolic pathways are used to
fuel cellular growth and survival. Two basic metabolites that exemplify these differences through increased
uptake and altered metabolic usage are glucose and glutamine. These molecules can be catabolized to
manufacture many of the building blocks required for active cell growth and proliferation. The alterations in
the metabolic pathways necessary to sustain this growth have been linked to therapeutic resistance, a trait that is
correlated with poor patient outcomes. By targeting the metabolic pathways that import, catabolize, and
synthesize essential cellular components, drug-resistant cancer cells can often be resensitized to anticancer
treatments. The speciﬁcity and efﬁcacy of agents directed at the unique aspects of cancer metabolism are
expected to be high; and may, when in used in combination with more traditional therapeutics, present a
pathway to surmount resistance within tumors that no longer respond to current forms of treatment. Cancer Res;

Introduction
One of the distinguishing features of cancer is an escape
from the typical regulatory constraints that prevent rapid and
uncontrolled cellular division. Many cellular modiﬁcations
occur within the bioenergetic and metabolic pathways, driven
by the energetic needs of a dividing cell. One of the earliest
examples of altered metabolism was shown in Otto Warburg's
seminal work, wherein Warburg observed that cancerous
tissues use oxygen-independent methods for breaking down
glucose (1, 2). While the Warburg effect is not yet fully
understood, it seems to consistently arise in a wide variety of
cancers with diverse genetic backgrounds.
For cells integrated into the vasculature, nutrients are
continually available and cancer cells absorb these nutrients
at a much higher rate than normal cells (3–5). Thus, the
metabolic changes exhibited in cancer are a result of factors
beyond pure energy production and instead work to support
unconstrained cellular growth by generating the cellular
resources that a rapidly dividing cell requires (6, 7). Nucleotide
triphosphates and amino acids are necessary building blocks
for genome replication and protein synthesis that occur as cells

grow. Furthermore, growth and division both require expansion of the cellular, nuclear, and mitochondrial membranes,
which necessitates increased fatty acid synthesis to support
the production of the lipid bilayers. In addition to basic
building blocks, other components necessary to fuel cellular
growth (ATP and NADPH) or protect the growing cell (NADH
and NADþ) are regulated through components of the aerobic
glycolysis machinery and must have their levels carefully
managed to ensure that the basic building blocks can be
efﬁciently converted into new biomass (8).
Glucose and glutamine can be broken down into the raw
materials necessary to drive tumor growth (6, 9). The metabolic
shift and increased glucose catabolism observed in cancer cells
results in increased production of the biosynthetic precursors
consumed as a cell grows. With upregulated glucose import, a
fraction of the glucose taken in will be used in biosynthesis
pathways upstream of pyruvate or be converted to pyruvate
and enter the TCA cycle to provide precursors for fatty acid and
amino acid synthesis, whereas all remaining glucose is converted to lactate and exported from the cell (4). Glutamine
catabolism follows a similar pattern: Glutamine uptake is
enhanced, and a portion of the glutamine is catabolized to
maintain cellular levels of basic biosynthetic precursors, but
the majority of cellular glutamine is converted into lactate or
alanine (4, 10, 11). In contrast with the catabolism of glucose,
conversion of glutamine to lactate passes through the TCA
cycle, which aids in the maintenance of the pool of mitochondrial carbons and NADPH. The remaining glutamine provides
carbon and nitrogen sources for amino acid synthesis and
contributes nitrogen in purine and pyrimidine base synthesis
(11). The uptake and breakdown of glucose and glutamine
represent the central pathway for fueling tumor growth and
methods that target these pathways can have signiﬁcant
effects on cellular growth and viability.

Butler et al.

Although many aspects of tumor metabolism rely on the
conserved metabolic pathways commonly used by rapidly
proliferating cells, evidence indicates that there are facets of
tumor metabolism that differ from nontumorigenic proliferating cells. Work investigating the M2 isoform of pyruvate
kinase (PKM2) indicates that in cells with low pyruvate kinase
activity, as it is in those expressing the PKM2 isoform, pyruvate
can be formed from PEP through PGAM1 phosphorylation (12).
This alternative pathway allows for a decoupling of ATP
production from glucose metabolism, providing a way to
prevent the allosteric inhibition of glycolysis pathway enzymes
that occurs at high concentrations of ATP while still generating
the downstream biomolecules necessary for cellular growth
(12). Comparison of the gene expression proﬁles for oncogenic
foci and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) shows that
whereas many pathways are modulated in a similar fashion,
such as the upregulation of monosaccharide metabolic genes
or downregulation of differentiation related genes, there are
still distinct differences (13). The oncogenic foci upregulated
a large variety of metabolic clusters—such as carbohydrate
metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, membrane lipid metabolism, and organophosphate metabolism—in addition to cellular stress and damage pathways, whereas the expression
proﬁle of the iPSC activated pluriopotency-related gene families (13). Exploiting the cancer-speciﬁc upregulation of stress
pathways has already been shown to be an effective strategy for
the development of highly selective anticancer treatments (14).
Piperlongumine triggers cell death in cancerous cells but not in
rapidly or slowly proliferating normal cells; murine tumor
xenografts treated with piperlongumine displayed drastic
response with no observed toxicity in normal mice (14). Similar
speciﬁcity may be achievable through treatments targeting the
dysregulated aspects of cancer metabolism.
Work linking dysregulated metabolism to drug resistance
indicates that resistance may arise in part because altered
metabolism can produce elevated ATP and NADPH levels (15,
16). Common mechanisms for generating chemoresistance are
energy intensive and include enhanced DNA repair, misregulation of growth factor signaling, increased drug efﬂux, higher
expression of antiapoptotic genes, or survival signaling pathways (17). Chemotherapies exert cytotoxic effects in part by
inducing oxidative damage (18, 19), whereas increased glucose
consumption gives rise to abundant NADPH, which contributes to therapeutic resistance (20, 21). The ability of deregulated metabolic pathways to protect cancer cells makes them
attractive targets for improving chemotherapeutics (Supplementary Table S1).

Targeting the Resource Absorption Machinery to
Potentiate Therapeutics
Cancer cells depend on their altered metabolism to generate
the necessary resources to fuel their growth, and the synthesis
of these building blocks is dependent on the catabolism of
glucose and glutamine. The uptake of glucose and glutamine is
often increased through the upregulation of transporters, such
as the GLUT family glucose transporters or the ASCT2 amino
acid transporter. These are commonly targeted in an attempt

2710

Cancer Res; 73(9) May 1, 2013

to disrupt the dysregulated metabolism observed in cancer
cells.
Glucose transport
The GLUT family proteins facilitate the uptake of extracellular glucose, and are often upregulated in cancer. Directly
targeting these transporters is one way to attack tumor growth.
In nude mice xenografts and cell culture, A549 lung cancer cells
display lower GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake when
treated with the irreversible GLUT1 inhibitor WZB117, resulting in an inhibition of growth that is synergistic with both
cisplatin and paclitaxel (22). Exogenous ATP rescued cellular
growth, indicating that the decrease in GLUT1 expression
slowed tumor growth by limiting available ATP (22). In vitro
WZB117 shows selectivity for cancer cells, whereas studies in
animal models show relatively high efﬁcacy and low toxicity,
but treatment also induces transient hyperglycemia and a
slight decrease in weight resulting from a loss of fat (22). Renal
cell carcinomas lacking functional von Hippel–Lindau (VHL)
tumor suppressor genes have been shown to be selectively
targeted by an inhibitor of GLUT1, STF-31, whereas no effect
has been observed on glycolysis in cells expressing the wildtype VHL gene (23). In vivo, STF-31–based inhibition of GLUT1
was able to impede glucose uptake and kill tumor cells with no
toxicity for noncancerous cells (23). Although inhibition of
glucose transporters varies in efﬁcacy based on the tumor type
when the strategy is used alone, it is effective when coupled
with other drugs as part of a combinatorial strategy. The
glucose transporters are critical for maintenance of multiple
myeloma cells, but studies have shown that inhibition of
glucose transporters can increase sensitivity to other chemotherapeutics. This can be observed in how the off-target
inhibition of the GLUT4 transporter by the HIV protease
inhibitor ritonavir increases doxorubicin sensitivity in multiple
myeloma cell lines (24). Combinatorial treatment has also been
an effective way to overcome chemoresistance. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) enhances the expression of GLUT1 in
hypoxic environments, a condition that frequently occurs in
tumors. Hypoxia is well known to contribute to resistance to
chemotherapeutics, yet inhibition of GLUT1 via phloretin
overcomes this hypoxia-induced resistance when used in
combination with daunorubicin (25). Whereas phloretin is a
competitive inhibitor for glucose transporters, low concentrations have been shown to be effective on hypoxic cells—a
property that could enhance the selectivity of this treatment
(25). With data indicating that GLUT3 is upregulated in
temozolomide-resistant cells, overcoming chemoresistance by
targeting glucose transport coupled with treatment with standard chemotherapeutic agents may be an effective strategy
against drug-resistant tumors (26).
Glutamine transport
Like glucose transport, upregulation of glutamine transporters is commonly observed in cancer cells (11). For many
cancers, disruption of the constant uptake of glutamine can
lead to outcomes more drastic than expected for pure amino
acid starvation (27–30). In hepatocellular carcinoma, silencing
of the glutamine transporter ASCT2 by inducible antisense

Targeting Cancer Metabolism to Overcome Therapeutic Resistance

RNA results in cellular death within 48 hours (31). The importance of glutamine transporters for cellular survival is further
shown by the effect of selective estrogen receptor modulators
(SERM), such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, on ER cell lines and
cell lines derived from estrogen-insensitive tissues (32). Both
tamoxifen and raloxifene can inhibit the glutamine transporter
ASCT2 and lower cellular uptake of glutamine, resulting in
growth inhibition and apoptosis in cell lines that are estrogen
insensitive (32). Finally, inhibition of the SLC6A14 amino acid
transporter by a-methyl-DL-tryptophan (a-MT) induces phenotypes associated with amino acid starvation, such as mTOR
inhibition and activation of autophagy, but when coupled with
an inhibitor of autophagy, the combined treatment triggers
apoptosis (33). Although a-MT is only effective in the subset of
cells expressing the SLC6A14 transporter, which is not
expressed in all cancer types, it is highly selective for malignant
cells, as SLC6A14 seems not to be expressed in nonmalignant
cells (33). Both glucose and glutamine transporters play a key
role in providing cancerous cells with resources, and inhibiting
them results in slower cell growth or cellular death, even in
cells that have been shown to be refractory to other chemotherapeutic treatments.

Targeting the Metabolic Machinery to Potentiate
Therapeutics
Targeting the resource import machinery that fuels dysregulated metabolism can be an effective strategy for cancer
therapeutics. Once the basic resources have entered the cell, a
wide variety of components within the biosynthetic cellular
machinery are required to synthesize the biologic precursors
that support continued cellular division. Later in this review we
discuss selected elements within the biosynthetic pathways
that have shown promise in sensitizing chemoresistant cells.
Glycolysis
Hexokinase catalyzes the ﬁrst step in the catabolism of
glucose, a key step in the glycolytic pathway. Two smallmolecule inhibitors, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP), target hexokinase and to disrupt the early
steps of glycolysis and have shown promise as chemotherapeutic agents.
2-DG is a glucose analogue that cannot be fully processed by
the glycolytic enzymes, resulting in an inhibition of glycolysis
after it is phosphorylated by hexokinase. We have shown that 2DG can effectively induce apoptosis in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, whereas hypoxic tumor cells are known to be sensitive to 2-DG treatment (34–36). The use of 2-DG as a solo
agent is limited because of the high concentration necessary to
compete with glycolytic pathway products, but it has been
effective as part of a combinatorial treatment regimen. The
chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin and paclitaxel signiﬁcantly slowed tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice
with osteosarcoma and non–small cell lung xenografts, respectively, when mice were cotreated with 2-DG (36). We have also
shown that trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells can be
resensitized to trastuzumab through the addition of 2-DG (37).
Finally, Bcl-2 family antagonists are only effective in certain cell
varieties, but highly resistant leukemias are sensitized and

www.aacrjournals.org

undergo rapid apoptosis when Bcl-2 antagonist treatment is
preceded by glycolysis inhibitor 2-DG (38).
A second small-molecule glycolysis inhibitor that has shown
promise as a chemotherapeutic agent is the pyruvic acid
derivative 3-BP, which also targets hexokinase. Supplying extra
ATP exogenously can induce chemoresistance in colon cancer
cells, whereas ATP-depleting factors such as 3-BP have been
shown to help induce sensitivity to cell lines selected for
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as oxaliplatin and
5-ﬂuorouracil (16). Studies show that ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter-based resistance to daunorubicin or mitoxantrone is also highly dependent on cellular ATP levels (39).
Daunorubicin or mitoxantrone treatment in vitro (human
myeloma, myelogenous leukemia, and liver carcinoma cell
lines) or in vivo (murine xenografts) showed suppressed resistance, increased cytotoxicity, and slowed subcutaneous tumor
growth when coupled with 3-BP (39). Studies in animal models
have shown a lack of in vivo toxicity and an inability to cross the
blood brain–barrier, but as a competitive inhibitor, the concentrations necessary for therapeutic effect as a solo agent may
be prohibitive. The success of glycolysis inhibitors such as 2DG and 3-BP predicts that other inhibitors targeting components in these pathways will also have a high likelihood to
produce drug-sensitizing effects.
PKM2 is preferentially expressed in many cancers and favors
glycolysis (12, 40). Inhibitors of PKM2 have shown highly
selective antitumor activity in animal and human xenografts
tumor models (41–45). Recent work also shows that reducing
PKM2 activity via CD44 knockdown results in lower cellular
glutathione levels, decreased glucose uptake, lactate production, and ATP production while increasing reactive oxygen
species (ROS) levels and also enhancing cisplatin sensitivity
(20). As decreased activity of PKM2 helps overcome hypoxiainduced drug resistance, small-molecule compounds that
modify PKM2 activity—such as TLN-232 (inhibitor) and 2Oxo-N-aryl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-6-sulfonamides (activator)—may also be effective in lowering resistance to current
chemotherapeutic treatments (41, 46). The TLN-232 inhibitor
has exhibited high selectivity even at low doses for cancer cells
in vitro and in in vivo animal models, and although TLN-232
treatment does trigger a transient weight loss, it is well
tolerated with no toxicity observed even at high doses (41, 46).
Glutamine catabolism
Glutaminase catalyzes the ﬁrst step in the catabolism of
glutamine, hydrolyzing it into glutamate and ammonia. Inhibition of glutaminase can deprive the cell of biosynthetic
precursors needed for rapid growth, evidenced by the reduction of in vitro growth of glioblastoma cells containing an
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation common to many gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemias observed when glutaminase activity was reduced through siRNA or BPTES treatment (30). Glutamine analogues often cause in vivo toxicity,
lack speciﬁcity, or are generally ineffective, whereas inhibitors
of glutaminase—such as BPTES—provide an opportunity to realize the beneﬁts of glutamine deprivation in a way that minimizes the clinical downsides (30). The small-molecule inhibitor
968 prevents Rho GTPase-mediated cellular transformation by

Butler et al.

inhibiting glutaminase, an essential component in Rho
GTPase-mediated transformation, yet elicited no effect on the
growth or morphology of normal cells (47). In addition to
blocking cellular transformation, 968 also showed the ability to
inhibit the in vivo growth of lymphoma murine xenografts (47).
Glutaminolysis is also integrated into the amino acid biosynthesis pathways by activating mTORC1 signaling and fueling
cellular growth, which also could induce mTORC1-mediated
resistance to common chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin in malignant AFP-producing gastric carcinomas (48, 49).
Inhibition of mTORC1 with the dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 can resensitize Jurkat
cells with induced vincristine resistance, clearly showing that
reducing mTORC1 activity can lead to therapeutic sensitivity
in resistant cells (50). NVP-BEZ235 exhibits minimal effects on
normal cells in vitro but shows good oral bioavailability and low
toxicity in vivo (50). Inhibiting glutaminolysis is predicted to
have a similar sensitizing effect, through the reduction of
mTOR signaling and depletion of the cellular pool of available
resources. Glutamine is a critical resource for dysregulated
cellular growth, and inhibition of glutamine breakdown by
targeting glutaminase merits further exploration as an antitumorigenic and therapeutic potentiating strategy. The important role of mTOR and PI3K pathways in cancer has been
covered exhaustively elsewhere (51–63).
Lactate production and export
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a key glycolytic enzyme, as
it converts pyruvate into lactate and provides a pathway for
nonoxidative disposal of the byproducts of glycolysis. Lactic
acid is a signiﬁcant byproduct of cancer cell metabolism and is
often exported from the cell to remove excess carbon and
maintain cellular NADPH stores (4). Inhibition of MCT1-based
lactate export through treatment with a-cyano-4-OH-cinnamate (CHC) or lonidamine causes the tumor microenvironment to decrease in pH, with signiﬁcant levels of cellular death
occurring as the pH reaches 6.5, the typical microenvironmental tumor pH (64–66). CHC treatment has been shown to
effectively slow the tumor growth rate in murine models of
lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma xenografts, whereas Lewis lung carcinoma tumor-bearing mice
treated with CHC showed greatly increased sensitivity to a
single 6 Gy dose of radiation (65, 66). Mild side effects have been
observed in patients after lonidamine treatment, with approximately half displaying myalgia; similarly, animal models indicate that the negative side effects of lonidamine are less likely
to occur when it is given orally rather than intravenously. The
LDH-A isoform has been shown to be upregulated in response
to the overexpression of oncogenes such as HER2 and MYCN
(64, 67). Targeting the conversion of pyruvate to lactate has also
been shown to be a productive anticancer strategy. Glycolytic
cell types have shown susceptibility to FX11-based LDH-A
inhibition, exempliﬁed by inhibition of tumor growth formation in P198 pancreatic xenografts, p493 b-lymphoma xenografts, and pancreatic LZ10.7 cells. Inhibition of LDH-A via
siRNA or FX11 treatment results in increased mitochondrial
function, evidenced by higher oxygen consumption and ROS
generation, as well as an increase in necrosis and cellular death.

2712

Cancer Res; 73(9) May 1, 2013

When FX11 was combined with FK866, a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitor, tumors underwent regression,
whereas FK866 or FX11 alone merely slowed tumor growth (68,
69). Although solubility may require further derivatization of
FX11, animals undergoing FX11 treatment did not lose weight
or exhibit any symptoms of toxicity (68, 69). In addition, we
have shown that the inhibition of LDH-A, either through siRNA
or oxamate treatment, can overcome resistance to both paclitaxel and trastuzumab (37, 70).
Citric acid cycle
Metformin is a complex I inhibitor for the mitochondrial
respiratory chain that is best known for its use as a treatment of
diabetes. A study of the incidence rate of cancer within
diabetics linked metformin use to lower incidence rates of
cancer and better survival for diabetic patients who developed
pancreatic cancer (71–74). In addition to the initial studies
linking metformin to better clinical outcomes for diabetic
patients with pancreatic cancer, newer work has investigated
the ability of metformin to address therapeutic resistance in a
variety of cancer types.
Cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines showed a synergistic response to treatment with metformin and phenethyl
isothiocyanate (PEITC), resulting in slower cancer cell growth
and induction of cell death for ovarian cancer cells (75).
Similarly, pancreatic cancer ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines
(SUIT-2 and MIAPaCa-2) exhibiting varying degrees of gemcitabine resistance have been used to test the efﬁcacy of gemcitabine treatment in combination with metformin or metformin and R1507 [a humanized anti–insulin-like growth factorIR (IGF-IR) monoclonal antibody]. The combination of gemcitabine with metformin or metformin and R1507 induced
greater inhibition of cellular proliferation and more apoptosis
than solo treatment, whereas gemcitabine treatment alone
increased the expression of genes indicative of chemoresistance, such as survivin and XIAP (76). Metformin has also
been tested with respect to trastuzumab-resistant HER2ampliﬁed breast cancers (77). Selectively targeting more chemoresistant cell populations, such as cancer stem cells (CSC),
may provide a strategy to resensitize a tumor to chemotherapeutic compounds. Metformin has been reported to preferentially target CSC-like cells and is signiﬁcantly more effective
in CD44þ/CD24/low JIMT-1 cells, a cell line derived from a
pleural metastasis of a patient resistant to trastuzumab, compared with non-the CD44þ/CD24/low JIMT-1 cell population,
in vitro (77). Similarly, xenografts of JIMT1 were resistant to
trastuzumab treatment, as no reduction in tumor growth was
observed over a 7-week course of treatment. However, when
treated with metformin alone or trastuzumab in combination
with metformin, tumor volumes were reduced by 2- or 4-fold
respectively, indicating that metformin treatment can help
overcome trastuzumab resistance (77).
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) phosphorylates and
inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, preventing the formation
and entry of acetyl-CoA into the citric acid cycle. Increased
expression or activity of PDK isoforms may play a role in the
metabolic shift away from mitochondrial oxidation and contributes to drug resistance, as siRNA-targeting PDK restores

Targeting Cancer Metabolism to Overcome Therapeutic Resistance

mitochondrial oxidation in cancerous, but not normal, cells
(78, 79). The small-molecule dichloroacetate (DCA) also inhibits PDK-triggering apoptosis in cancerous cells but requires
pharmacologically prohibitive concentrations to be effective,
likely due to the decrease in expression of the cellular transporter responsible for DCA uptake in cancer cells (78, 80).
Combination therapy with other agents, such as omeprazole or
temozolomide, has shown to be more effective than solo
treatments (81, 82). This shows that targeting components
related to the citric acid cycle can be an effective strategy in the
design of new therapeutics.
Fatty acid synthesis
ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) catalyzes the ATP-dependant
conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, a key
step in fatty acid biosynthesis. As expected, treatment with the
ACLY inhibitor SB-204990 reduced cellular acetyl-CoA concentrations (83). In A549 xenografts, ACLY inhibition is cytostatic and induces differentiation, whereas for pancreatic
xenografts SB-204990 treatment resulted in signiﬁcant growth
inhibition. ACLY inhibition results in more severe effects for
more glycolytic cells, as ACLY inhibition hinders glucosedependant lipid synthesis, and this is expected to make the
effects of compounds that inhibit ACLY favor tumor cells over
nonglycolytic and vegetative cells, as the latter are less dependant on ACLY activity (83). SB-204990 is orally bioavailable and
shows no toxicity in animal models, but may have low in vivo
stability (83).
Synthesis of the fatty acids used for lipogenesis requires
precursors derived from the citric acid cycle, such as acetylCoA or malonyl-CoA. These precursors are then used by fatty
acid synthase (FASN) enzyme complex to produce components necessary for lipogenesis, such as palmitate. FASN is
upregulated in many cancers and correlates with poor
patient outcomes, such as metastasis. FASN knockdown
xenografts had smaller, slower-growing tumors with lower
tumorigenic potential and less metastasis relative to FASNexpressing xenografts (84). FASN inhibitors, such as
G28UCM, were able to effectively reduce the size of established xenografts by 20% to 90%. This decrease in size was
accompanied by increased apoptotic cell death and
decreased HER2 phosphorylation (85). Most FASN inhibitors
(e.g., cerulenin, C75, EGCG) are unstable or impotent, or
have signiﬁcant side effects (anorexia and weight loss) in
vivo, yet G28UCM-treated animals displayed no anorexia or
weight loss, whereas G28UCM retained the ability to inhibit
FASN activity and reduce tumor size (85). In vitro, G28UCM
showed synergistic interactions with trastuzumab, lapatinib,
erlotinib, and geﬁtinib; whereas trastuzumab (AU565TR) or
lapatinib (AU565LR)–resistant cells retained FASN expression and sensitivity—providing an alternative method for
overcoming drug resistance (85).

Conclusions
Earlier we have provided examples of compounds that can
effectively resensitize cancer cells to therapeutics to which
they had shown resistance. The focus of this article is on

metabolic inhibitors that target either signaling transduction
networks or key metabolic enzymes that are commonly dysregulated in cancer (Fig. 1). Although both strategies can be
effective, directly targeting signal transduction networks
often results in compensation through other closely related
pathways, whereas the mechanisms allowing a cell to compensate for loss or inhibition of a rate-limiting or pathwayinitiating enzymes in the essential metabolic pathways are
more limited (86).
Metabolic pathway components, such as those involved in
glucose usage and amino acid biosynthesis, are likely to be
good targets. Inhibition of PFKFB3 represses phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) by reducing fructose 2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP)
synthesis. This leads to a decreased glycolytic characteristics
evidenced by lower glucose uptake and less production of
lactate, ATP, NADþ, and NADH (87). 3-(3-Pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO) is a small-molecule inhibitor of
PFKFB3 that has shown selectivity for transformed cells in vitro
and suppresses growth of Lewis lung carcinoma, MDA-MB-231
breast adenocarcinoma, and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia
xenografts (87). Given the observed effects on tumor growth
in a variety of cancers as well as the metabolic changes 3PO
treatment induces, PFK1 inhibition may produce chemosensitization in a similar manner to what happens when other
glycolytic enzymes are inhibited.
Recent work also shows that for some forms of breast
cancer, a key component of the serine biosynthesis pathway,
phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), is often ampliﬁed in cancer resulting in increased activity of the serine
biosynthesis pathway (88). Knockdown of PHGDH in breast
cancer cell lines exhibiting increased PHGDH expression
reduces a-ketoglutarate (a-KG) levels, inhibits proliferation,
and induces cellular death (88). Because increased PHGDH is
observed in approximately 70% of ER breast cancers, it is
reasonable to expect that treatments disrupting PHGDH
function and enzymes related to serine biosynthesis will
present an attractive strategy for overcoming resistance to
chemotherapeutics (88, 89). Similarly, cellular stress pathways have been shown to be upregulated in cancerous cells
(13). New research linking cellular stress to metabolism
indicates that components within the ROS and heat shock
response pathways might also be targets capable of producing highly selective synergistic responses with current chemotherapeutic agents (13, 14, 67, 90, 91).
The link between therapeutic sensitivity and dysregulated cancer cell metabolism is quickly being dissected in a
variety of studies about a diverse array of cancers and
therapeutic agents. It is becoming clear that this may
provide a strategy for surmounting the drug resistance
that endangers so many patients with cancer. We have
described a variety of metabolic aspects ranging from
resource uptake to breakdown or biosynthesis that can
contribute to or be targeted to overcome therapeutic resistance to an assortment of agents. Although no unifying
mechanism is apparent to show how inhibition of metabolic
pathways can result in resensitization to chemotherapeutics, common themes do occur. When cancer cell metabolism is disrupted, the presumed resource shortfalls are

Figure 1. A wide range of metabolic components supports the cancerous phenotype. Glucose and glutamine are metabolized into critical
intermediates necessary for cellular growth, such as amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids. The metabolic inhibitors discussed in this review
are shown in red near their target of inhibition. Disruption of these metabolic networks can reduce drug resistance and render cancer cells more
susceptible to current therapeutic regimens.

often not fatal. Many of the metabolic inhibitors or gene
knockdowns produced inhibitory effects on the cellular
growth rate but do not induce cellular death. Rapid cellular
growth seems to have a protective function, possibly due to
the fact that rapidly dividing cells have access to sufﬁcient
resources to enact energy-intensive therapeutic resistance
pathways on demand (15, 16). The extra resources available
may allow for the synthesis and operation of drug efﬂux
pumps and antiapoptotic genes such as surviving, and
inhibition of the dysregulated metabolism often reduces
ATP and other metabolic levels which may prevent efﬁcient
activation of resistance pathways (15, 76). Genomic instability frequently observed in cancers also ensures that a
population of growing cells is more likely to have the
genetic diversity to adapt to the selective pressures induced
by chemotherapeutic treatments (92–95). By curtailing
or preventing continued cellular growth, metabolic disruption might limit the ability of the tumor to adapt to the

2714

chemotherapeutic regimen. Finally, in many cases the disruption caused by inhibiting glycolytic metabolism results
in increased cellular stress (often in the form of higher
levels of ROS) or decreased protective response (such as
NADPH levels), which may predispose cells toward apoptosis or limit the ability of the tumor to address further
chemotherapeutic insult (14, 20, 68, 69). Many survival
pathways have both cytoprotective and cytotoxic functions,
and the increase in cellular stress induced by metabolic
inhibition may precondition the stress response pathways
toward apoptotic outcomes (14). As evidenced by the
diverse array of cancers discussed earlier, this method of
attacking therapeutic resistance in cancer is demonstratively effective in a wide variety of cancer types and merits
continued investigation.
