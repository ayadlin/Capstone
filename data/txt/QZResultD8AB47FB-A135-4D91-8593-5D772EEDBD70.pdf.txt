ABSTRACT
Receptor tyrosine kinases of the HER-family are involved in the development
and progression of multiple epithelial tumors, and have consequently become
widely used targets for new anti-cancer therapies. Trastuzumab, an antibody
against HER2, has shown potent growth inhibitory effects on HER2 overexpressing
tumors, including gastro-esophageal cancer, however, resistance to this therapy is
inevitable. Unfortunately, a paucity of data on the cellular mechanisms of resistance
to targeted therapeutic agents exists in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Using primary
established HER2-overexpressing cultures and patient-derived xenograft models,
we now reveal a novel resistance mechanism to trastuzumab in esophageal cancer:
In response to trastuzumab, both HER3 and the metalloprotease ADAM10 are
simultaneously upregulated. The proteolytic activity of the latter then releases the
HER3 ligand heregulin from the cell surface to activate HER3 and confer resistance
to trastuzumab by inducing compensatory growth factor receptor signaling. Blocking
either HER3 or ADAM10 effectively reverts the acquired resistance to trastuzumab.
Our data thus provide strategies to inhibit this signaling and circumvent resistance
to trastuzumab.

that activate for instance cell proliferation, and enhanced
cell motility [5]. As a consequence, HER family members
have been regarded as prime candidates for anti-cancer
targeting therapies using small molecule inhibitors or
humanized monoclonal antibodies [5–7].
Members of the HER family, including HER2,
can form hetero- or homodimers. Although no activating
ligand is known for this receptor, the most potent signaling
by HER2 is mediated by the heterodimers it forms with

INTRODUCTION
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family are
involved in the development and progression of multiple
epithelial tumors including esophageal adenocarcinoma
(EAC) [1–4]. Dimerization of and between these receptors
results in the phosphorylation of their intracellular
domains, stimulating downstream signaling pathways

HER3. Activation of this dimer is initiated by binding of
the ligand for HER3, heregulin (neuregulin-1β, NRG1β) [8, 9]. Signaling of the neuregulin ligands through
their matching HERs mediates important processes in
developmental biology, the adult organism, but also in
the development and progression of disease [10]. NRG1β is a product of one of the sixteen different transcripts
of neuregulin-1, and induces therapy resistance to the
EGFR-targeting antibody cetuximab in colorectal cancer,
RAF inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma, and MEK
inhibitors in metastatic uveal melanoma [11–15]. The
activation of NRG-1β requires proteolytic cleavage, as
it is produced as a transmembrane protein. Proteases that
can cleave the different neuregulin variants include the
disintegrin and metalloproteinase proteins ADAM10 and
ADAM17 [16, 17].
Whether a given esophageal tumor overexpresses
HER2 seems to depend on the location in the organ and
histological subtype. Overexpression has been described
to be between 0-43%. The adenocarcinoma subtype is
most often HER2 positive (10-43%) and is therefore a
likely candidate for HER2-inhibitory treatment [2, 18].
Indeed, the phase III ToGA trial showed a significant
survival benefit of trastuzumab, a humanized antibody
against HER2, combined with chemotherapy compared
to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced-stage
esophageal or gastric adenocarcinomas [19]. However,
the improvement in survival was modest and, importantly,
even patients with an initial response to trastuzumab
eventually showed progression. Thus, resistance to
trastuzumab is a major problem in esophagogastric cancer
patients [20, 21].
The mechanisms of resistance against trastuzumab
are various and include the upregulation of other tyrosine
kinase receptors such as IGF1R or MET receptor [22–24],
or reactivating mutations and protein overexpression
in the pathway downstream of HER2, including PTEN,
PI3K, and c-SRC. These have mainly been defined in
breast cancer [25–27]. In EAC, however, mutations in
HER2 or its downstream signaling pathway components
are not common and the mechanisms of resistance in
this disease are unclear [28]. Given the high degree
of specificity of trastuzumab for HER2, upregulation
and activation of HER family members other than the
targeted receptor could occur. Of these, HER3 is the most
likely candidate because of its involvement in resistance
mechanisms in other cancer types, including trastuzumabinduced resistance in breast cancer and resistance to MEK
inhibition in KRAS-mutant lung and colon cancer [29,
30]. Unfortunately, a paucity of data on the expression
of HERs in EAC other than EGFR and HER2 exists,
and so far limited data on HER3 levels and expression
dynamics in EAC have been reported [31, 32]. In this
study, we defined the dynamics of HER family member
expression during HER2-targeting treatment and in doing
so identified a entirely novel mechanism of resistance.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Resistance is induced by the concomitant upregulation
of both HER3 and the metalloprotease ADAM10. The
proteolytic activity of the latter protein then leads to the
release of the HER3 ligand NRG-1β, which in its turn is
able to re-activate the HER2/HER3 signaling axis. This
compensatory signaling can be blocked at several levels,
namely by the inhibition of HER3 or ADAM10, resulting
in an abrogation of resistance to trastuzumab.

RESULTS
Long term trastuzumab treatment is
accompanied by the upregulation of
EGFR and HER3
In order to assess the mechanisms of resistance
to trastuzumab in EAC, we measured the sensitivity
to this drug over time in two HER2-positive EAC
cell lines; OE19 (highly overexpressing HER2) and
OE33 (intermediate HER2 overexpression, see also
Supplementary Figure S1). A dose-dependent effect of
trastuzumab on cell viability was observed, and HER2
expression levels correlated with the magnitude of
response (Figures 1A and 1B). Surprisingly, both cell
lines showed a reduced sensitivity to trastuzumab within
a relatively short time frame, seemingly incompatible
with a selection for clones harboring mutated signaling
components. Instead, a possible explanation for this
resistance could be the upregulation of compensatory
receptors other than HER2 to activate shared downstream
signaling components. To determine which HER family
members might activate such signaling, EAC cells were
treated with trastuzumab, and surface levels of candidate
receptors were determined.
Of the receptors analyzed following short-term
(48h) treatment, HER4 showed a marked upregulation
as determined by flow cytometry and transcript analysis
(Supplementary Figures 2A–E). Inducibly HER4-silenced
OE19 cells showed a restored sensitivity to trastuzumab
up until 72 hours, which was again lost after 96 hours
(Supplementary Figure 2F). We concluded from this that
HER4 is likely not sufficient to drive resistance over the
longer periods that are relevant to human disease. We
hypothesized other RTKs to be responsible for this instead.
In order to determine which HER family members
could induce long-term resistance to trastuzumab, cells
were cultured continuously with trastuzumab from 1
up till 6 months, and cell surface levels of HERs were
measured (Figures 1C and 1D). HER2 levels were still
decreased. Surface HER4 levels were lower compared
to short-term treated cultures. Instead, EGFR and HER3
expression levels were now increased, suggesting a role
for these RTKs in the resistance against trastuzumab over
extended periods of time. To assess if the mechanism of
resistance to trastuzumab observed in the cell lines also

held true in primary material, we established patient
derived xenografts from HER2-overexpressing tumors
and derived cultures from these (Figures 1E – 1H) [33].
These cells were sensitive to trastuzumab (Figure 1I), and
were subsequently cultured with trastuzumab for extended
periods of time. HER dynamics were measured by flow
cytometry and revealed the same pattern of EGFR and
HER3 upregulation as the cell lines (Figure 1J).
To assess whether the resistance to trastuzumab by
upregulation of compensatory receptors is conserved in
vivo, we treated tumor-bearing mice (AMC-EAC-007)
with trastuzumab and assessed tumor growth, and HER
levels after the experiment. As expected for a HER2positive tumor, a strong inhibitory effect of trastuzumab
on tumor growth was observed for all tested doses
(Figure  2A). However, tumor regrowth was observed
after 4 weeks despite treatment, and we concluded that by
this time the tumors had developed resistance. When HER
levels were assessed (Figure 2B), a clear dose-dependent
decrease in HER2 was observed, as well as a significant
increase of HER3 and HER4. IGF1R levels remained
constant, and in contrast to the in vitro data, no increase in
EGFR levels was observed either. Thus, the upregulation
of HER3 is the most conserved and consistent response
following HER2 inhibition.

of cell death in two cell lines and two primary cultures
established from patient-derived xenografts (Figure 3A –
3E). Furthermore, cell viability assays showed increased
sensitivity towards panitumumab (a humanized antibody
directed against EGFR) in the long-term trastuzumab treated
cells (Supplementary Figure S3). However, HER3 inhibition
(Figure 3A) was the most effective treatment compared to
EGFR inhibition (Supplementary Figure 3). Taken together,
these data show a consistent mechanism of resistance upon
long-term trastuzumab treatment through upregulation
of HER3, and show that inhibition of this receptor can
circumvent resistance to trastuzumab.

Neuregulin-1β induced HER3 activation is
mediated by ADAM10
In contrast to HER2, HER3 requires ligand for its
activation and its upregulation per se cannot account
for activation of its downstream pathway. Therefore, we
measured known ligands of HER3 in our experimental
setup, and found NRG-1β in the supernatant of long-term
trastuzumab treated cells. This ligand was absent from
control conditions (Figure 4A). To determine if this NRG1β was biologically active, we used a primary colon cancer
line (CC09) that expresses HER3 but not the ligands for
this receptor as a reporter [34]. Supernatant of long-term
treated OE19s was indeed found to contain biologically
active NRG-1β, inducing HER3 phosphorylation in CC09
cells (Figure 4B).
NRG-1β needs to be released from the cell surface
for its dissemination and activity. This is typically induced
by the enzymatic action of dedicated proteins like the
ADAMs, and we hypothesized the release of HER3 ligand
in the supernatant of the long-term trastuzumab treated
cells to also be a product of proteolytic cleavage. Levels

Targeting HER3 overcomes resistance to
trastuzumab
To assess the functional relevance of the observed
upregulation of HER3, blocking antibody (a-HER3) was
added to long-term and short-term trastuzumab treated cells
and cell morphology was assessed (Figure 3A). Long-term
treatment with trastuzumab in combination with a-HER3
resulted in a reduction of cell viability and induction

of the two best characterized metalloproteases involved
in HER ligand shedding, ADAM10 and –17 [16] were
determined following long-term trastuzumab treatment.
Increased levels of ADAM10 were observed in response
to trastuzumab (Figures 4C and 4D). To functionally
assess if this ADAM10 is involved in the release of NRG1β, cells were either treated with an ADAM10 inhibitor,
or transduced with silencing RNA against ADAM10.
Analysis of the supernatants of these cells indeed showed
a decreased NRG-1β release by those cells of which
ADAM10 function was inhibited (Figure 4E).
To address whether the ADAM10-induced release
of NRG-1β is required for HER3-mediated resistance,
untreated, short-term, or long-term trastuzumab treated

cells were incubated with ADAM10 inhibitor and a
reversal of resistance to trastuzumab was observed in
the latter condition (Figures 4F – 4I). Similarly, no effect
of ADAM10 knockdown was observed in otherwise
untreated cells by microscopy (Figures 5A and 5C, upper
row) and cell viability assays (Figures 5B and 5D, left
panels), while in long-term trastuzumab treated cells,
ADAM10 knockdown decreased cell numbers (Figures
5A and 5C, middle row). This effect could be rescued
by the addition of exogenous NRG-1β ligand, as shown
by microscopy (Figures 5A and 5C, lower row) and
cell viability assays (Figures 5B and 5D). To assess
the downstream signaling effects of long-term HER2
inhibition and ADAM10 knockdown, AKT and ERK

DISCUSSION

phosphorylation was determined under these conditions.
AKT phosphorylation remained stable following longterm trastuzumab treatment, while it decreased upon the
addition of ADAM10 knockdown (shA10 + LT trast.). The
addition of recombinant NRG-1β was able to restore AKT
phosphorylation in all conditions, thus rescuing growth
factor receptor signaling upon ADAM10 loss (Figure 5E).
ERK phosphorylation remained constant throughout all
experimental conditions.

We have identified an intricate non-genetic sequence
of events underlying resistance to trastuzumab in EAC.
The concomitant upregulation of a compensatory receptor
(HER3), as well as the metalloprotease (ADAM10)
required for the release and activation of HER3 ligand
(NRG-1β), function in union to induce resistance. Despite
the apparent complexity of this mechanism, we found

it to be remarkably consistent between the different
experimental models tested. Although we also observed
increased EGFR levels upon trastuzumab treatment in
vitro, this effect was not observed in vivo. This difference
could be explained by the presence of factors in the extracellular matrix, obviating the need for overexpression
of EGFR in vivo. Furthermore, the randomized phase
III trial TRIO-013/LOGiC showed no additional effect
of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR
and HER2, on the overall survival of HER2 positive
gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma patients treated with
capecitabine and oxaliplatin [35]. Therefore, we take the
observed in vitro increase of EGFR to be a less consistent
and clinically relevant mechanism of trastuzumab-induced
resistance than the upregulation of HER3.

Previous studies in other solid malignancies,
including gastric cancer, have shown that overexpression
of HER3 correlates with poor outcome [36]. Trastuzumabinduced resistance through various receptor tyrosine
kinases including IGF1R and HER3 has been described
in ovarian and breast cancer [37, 38], and the latter study
also described antitumor activity of a combination of
trastuzumab and a HER3 inhibitor on trastuzumab-resistant
cells. Furthermore, phase-I dose-finding and feasibility
studies are currently running for advanced solid tumors
using humanized anti-HER3 monoclonal antibodies
[39–41]. Although none of these studies have provided an
explanation as to the source of HER3-activating ligand,
they do highlight the urgency of HER3 activation in tumor
progression and acquired resistance [42].

The interactions between the different HER
family members can activate common downstream
signaling pathways.[5] However, they rely on different
activation mechanisms at the cell surface, which has
consequences for the efficacy of HER inhibiting strategies.
For instance, the favored and most potent dimers are
HER2-3 heterodimers and although trastuzumab is an
effective HER2 dimerization inhibitor, it cannot prevent
dimerization with ligand-bound HER3 [43, 44]. Our
finding that increased HER3 ligand release induces
resistance to trastuzumab, can therefore also be explained
by the fact that more of this ligand will be bound to the
HER3 receptor and facilitate the formation of active
HER2-3 heterodimers that are insensitive to trastuzumab.
Blocking the HER3 receptor is therefore effective not
only by blocking HER3 that is upregulated in response
to the loss of HER2, but also by targeting the interaction
between HER3 and HER2.
Of the ADAM family of metalloproteases,
ADAM10 and ADAM17 are the best described members
to shed HER ligands [16]. The release and activation of
NRG-1β by ADAM10 and –17 has mainly been studied in
the peripheral nervous system [45–47] and developmental
biology [48]. However, two recent papers reported on the
correlation of ADAM10 with survival in HER2-positive
breast cancer [49], and NRG-1b-HER3-HER2 signaling
was shown to promote trans-endothelial migration
of breast cancer cell lines [50]. These considerations
underscore the relevance of our finding that the release
of HER-activating ligand in esophageal cancer is in fact
induced by upregulated ADAM10.
Several clinically relevant consequences can be
inferred from our work. One is that HER2 positive EAC
is apparently eminently targetable with a low dose of
trastuzumab. Furthermore, the consistent role for HER3
and the required release of its ligand by ADAM10 implies
that in any HER2-positive EAC that develops resistance
to HER2-inhibiting drugs, HER3, ADAM10 and NRG1β can all be effective secondary targets. The first clinical
trials directed at HER3 inhibition are currently running,
and may prove to be a feasible strategy to safeguard
HER2-targeting therapies from failure.

England), and pertuzumab (Roche) were all kindly
provided by the Academic Medical Center pharmacy.
Anti-HER3 antibody (H3.105.5) was purchased from
Millipore (Temecula, CA). ADAM10 inhibitor GI
254023X and recombinant hNRG-1β were purchased
from R&D systems (Oxon, United Kingdom). NRG-1β
was used at 2ng/ml.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability was determined using the Cell
Titer-Blue Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega). Prior
to the assay, cells were either cultured under normal
conditions as described above or as for the long-term
treated condition; cells were cultured in trastuzumab
supplemented medium and were refreshed/ passed
twice a week. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a
density of 5000 cells/well in triplicates in culture medium
without trastuzumab. Of note, for the xenograft-derived
cells, a confluent monolayer of fibroblasts from the
same tumor was established prior to plating. 18 h after
plating, baseline cell viability was measured, treatment
was started (see below), and 20 μL of Cell Titer-Blue

Constructs and lentiviral transduction
Hairpins against HER4 and ADAM10 from the
Sigma Mission TRC library were cloned into pLKOTet-On or pLKO, respectively (primer sequences shown
in Table S1). Clones were verified by sequencing. Virus
production was performed as previously described [51].
To exclude an effect of doxycycline on the cells, control
silenced cells were also doxycycline treated.

Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA (Lonza)
and washed in FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% FBS).
5x105 cells were stained in a volume of 25µl for 30
minutes at 4°C. Antibodies were diluted in FACS buffer
using the following concentrations: FITC conjugated
a-HER2 affibody (1:1500, Bromma, Sweden); a-EGFR
(1:2000, clone H11, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA); a-HER3
(1:1500, clone SGP1, Abcam); a-HER4 (1:200, clone
H4.77.16, Abcam); a-IGFR (1:50, clone 33255, R&D,
Minneapolis, MN); ADAM10 (1:500, MAB1427,
R&D); ADAM17 (1:100, MAB9301, R&D). Secondary
APC labeled a-mouse (550826, BD) was diluted 1:800.
After washing, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer
containing 50ng/ml propidium Iodide (PI) (Sigma) and
acquired on a FACSCanto II (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
Data were analyzed with FlowJo 10 (Tree Star, Ashland,
OR). The geometric mean fluorescence (gMFI) intensity in
the relevant channel was calculated from the PI negative
gate; gMFI from the isotype control was subtracted from
the sample yielding the delta gMFI.

Cell viability

Cell culture and chemicals
OE19 and OE33 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were
maintained in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
L-glutamine (2mM), penicillin (100 units/mL), and
streptomycin (500 μg/mL) (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland)
according to routine cell culture procedures. HEK293T
cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM medium
and supplemented as mentioned above. Long-term treated
cells were continuously cultured with 1µg/ml trastuzumab

Plates were read in a cytofluormeter (BioTek Instruments,
Winooski, VT). Percentage of cell growth inhibition was
calculated by comparing the values obtained from treated
versus control cells, minus the baseline cell viability or
monolayer fibroblasts measured at 18 h after plating.
Control groups were treated with PBS. For combination
treatments, cells were either pre-treated for the indicated
time in the graphs with 1µg/ml trastuzumab or the same
volume of PBS in fully supplemented medium at normal
culture conditions. This, followed by an additional 48 h
treatment with either 0.1µg/ml panitumumab, a-HER3,
or 2µM ADAM10 inhibitor alone or in combination with
trastuzumab. In order to observe the effect of duration of
trastuzumab treatment, the experiments were performed
using trastuzumab-naïve cells, and cells that had been
cultured continuously with 1µg/ml trastuzumab for 1-6
months. Pre-treatment with trastuzumab for 48 h was
considered short-term, while treatment with trastuzumab
during 1-6 months was considered long-term (LT).

Thr202/Tyr204 (Cell Signaling, clone 197G2, #4377);
a-HER3 (Cell Signaling, clone D22C5, #12708) or
a-pHER3, Tyr1289 (Cell Signaling, clone D1B5, #2842);
a-AKT (Cell Signaling, #9272) or a-pAKT, Ser473 (Cell
Signaling, clone 193H12, #4058). All used 1:1.000. Goat
anti rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies was used at 1:10.000 (Cell Signaling,
#7074). Proteins were either imaged using a FuijFilm LAS
4000 imager, using Lumi-Light plus western blot substrate
(ROCHE, 12015196001) (Figure 4) or were develop on
film using enhanced bioluminescence for HRP (ECL) was
from GE Healthcare (Waukesha, WI, USA) (Figure 5).

Quantitative PCR
Cells or tumor tissue was lysed using Trizol
(Invitrogen) and RNA was isolated according to standard
procedures. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript
III (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using
SYBR green (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on a Lightcycler
LC480 II (Roche). Relative expression values were
calculated and normalized to a reference gene GAPDH
according to the comparative threshold cycle (Cp) method.
Primers were designed with Oligo Analyzer Version 3.1
Software. Primer sequences are listed in Table S1.

Patient derived xenografts and establishment of
primary cell lines
Collection of material from patients diagnosed
with esophageal adenocarcinoma in the Academic
Medical Center (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was
approved by the institute’s ethical committee (MEC
01/288#08.17.1042), and as described previously [33].
Informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Animals for xenografts were bred and maintained at the
local animal facility according to local legislation and
ethical approval was obtained (LEX102774). Xenografts
were processed as previously shown [33]. Animals were
anesthesized with 1% isoflurane during grafting.

Statistics
Differences between conditions indicated in the
figures were assessed using Student’s t-test or, in case
of multiple groups, with one-way ANOVA. A P value
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
values are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. derived
from three independent biological replicates. Analyses
were carried out using Graph Pad Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA or SPSS 10.1 software (SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL).

In vivo experiment
Second passage xenografts were processed to yield
equal sized pieces of 2 mm3 and grafted subcutaneously
into the flank of NSG mice with Matrigel (BD). Mice with
tumors reaching 100 mm3 were injected intraperitoneally
with 1, 25, or 50mg/kg trastuzumab once a week for
the duration of 4 weeks (n= 5 mice per dose). Tumor
growth was measured weekly. Five weeks after start of
treatment tumors were harvested and receptor expression
was assessed by flow cytometry analysis. Animals in this
experiment were bred and maintained at the local animal
facility according to local legislation and ethical approval
was obtained (LEX103096).
