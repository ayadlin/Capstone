Combining DNA Methyltransferase and Histone Deacetylase Inhibition to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Myelodysplastic
Syndrome: Achievements and Challenges

Already in 1982, shortly after the discovery of 5-azacytidine (5-aza) and 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (decitabine [DAC]) as
powerful DNA-hypomethylating agents, Jahangeer and colleagues reported that treatment of HeLa cells with 5-aza followed by butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, induced b-adrenergic receptor expression in a synergistic fashion.1 This probably first report of combination treatment with 2 chromatin-modifying agents, was followed by many
other in vitro studies combining the DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) inhibitors 5-aza and DAC with different HDAC
inhibitors to enhance their antineoplastic potency.2,3 For instance, as reported in a landmark article by Cameron et al,4
who applied sequential treatment with DAC and trichostatin A, several cell cycle-associated genes that are epigenetically
silenced in colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were induced synergistically by this combination,
providing a rationale for clinical trials using this approach.
The azanucleoside drugs 5-aza and DAC have recently become the new therapeutic standard in the treatment of different types of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)5-7 because of their ability to induce objective remissions and
prolong overall survival compared with low-dose cytarabine or sole best supportive care, even in patients with adverse cytogenetics. However, not all patients are responsive to Dnmt inhibitors; therefore, it is a very pertinent question whether the
combination of these drugs with HDAC inhibitors with proven activity in myeloid neoplasias might further improve
response rates these patients and prolong time to treatment resistance.
Several different HDAC inhibitors have entered the clinical arena; they belong to different chemical classes and, in
vitro and in vivo, can be differentiated by their abilities to inhibit enzymes that belong to both class I and II HDACs (socalled pan-HDAC inhibitors) or are class-selective (for review, see Wagner et al8). Valproic acid (VPA) is an orally available, short-chain fatty acid-based pan-HDAC inhibitor that has single-agent activity particularly in patients with MDS
who have lower-risk features.9,10 It has also been combined safely with DAC or 5-aza in AML/MDS patients, but so far
only in single-arm studies (shown in Table 1),11-16 in which it appeared to shorten the time to complete remission compared with historic data from the Dnmt inhibitor given alone. Therefore, the current study by Issa and colleagues17 in this
issue of Cancer provides the first randomized clinical trial addressing the value of oral VPA for 7 days as an add-on to
DAC started concurrently with 5 daily infusions (20 mg/m2) of the Dnmt inhibitor.
The authors enrolled 149 older patients with AML or high-risk MDS in their study and also included patients with
proliferative disease (ie, leukocytosis) who were first cytoreduced with hydroxyurea. Adaptive randomization was used to
assign 70 patients (the majority with AML) to a DAC-alone arm and 79 patients (the majority with MDS) to a DAC plus
VPA arm. The overall outcome, based on the objective response rate and overall survival, was comparable to that reported
previously with the 4-week-cyle administration of DAC: 55% of patients had an objective response, 34% achieved a complete response (CR), and the median survival was 11.9 months. A substantial number of patients with high-risk cytogenetics also responded, and almost 10% of patients could be bridged to the curative treatment modality, ie, allografting. Side
effects were mainly hematologic, and additional toxicity in the DAC plus VPA arm was observed (mostly neurologic
symptoms). Indeed, 10% of patients had to stop VPA completely (but continued DAC); and, in 30% of patients, the dose
of VPA had to be reduced.

This was the time to CR.

In this study, the addition of VPA did not result in a
measurable clinical benefit in terms of CR or overall
response rates or overall survival. This may have been
caused by different factors:
1. VPA was administered for only 7 days per treatment
course and at a relatively high dose, which differed
from the continuous dosing applied in several European studies. Thus, the total dose of VPA administered
over the entire treatment period (patients received a
median of 4 courses, equaling approximately 4-6
months of treatment) may be lower than when it is
given continuously, albeit at a lower daily dose.
2. VPA, like other HDAC inhibitors, may have induced
cell cycle arrest in the malignant cells when given
simultaneously with DAC. Theoretically, this may
hamper the incorporation of DAC into the DNA during synthesis of new strands, because fewer cells are
dividing and, thus, its therapeutic index would be
decreased. This suggests that sequential dosing, with
VPA starting only after the last infusion of DAC, might
yield different results. Similar to the current study, Prebet et al18 demonstrated in a randomized Intergroup
MDS trial that the simultaneous start of 5-aza and entinostat did not result in improved clinical outcomes

compared with 5-aza alone. It is noteworthy, however,
that those authors also demonstrated less genome-wide
DNA hypomethylation in bone marrow mononuclear
cells for patients in the combination arm compared with
patients in the 5-aza–alone arm. This may be caused by
cell cycle arrest in G1-phase induced by simultaneous
treatment. Indeed, the study group is entertaining this
hypothesis by conducting a follow-up clinical trial using
both drugs in which simultaneous administration is
compared with sequential administration (National
Clinical Trial NCT01305499).
3. It is well known that VPA is not considered as powerful
an HDAC inhibitor as vorinostat (SAHA), panobinostat (LBH589), entinostat (MS-275), or newer compounds such as pracinostat (an oral pan-HDAC
inhibitor that recently received orphan drug status for
AML treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration; MEI Pharma, Inc., San Diego, Calif). This, combined with the rather limited exposure time to VPA of
7 days per treatment course, may have played a role,
even if the serum levels measured were in the therapeutic range. With the active development of inhibitors of
other chromatin-modifying enzymes (such as histone
methyltransferases and demethylases), more potent

Dnmt and HDAC inhibitors, as discussed by Issa
et al,17 eventually may bear out the combination epigenetic therapy approach envisioned by Cameron et al.4
Like DAC, protocols using VPA and 5-aza vary considerably and, as is typical for phase 2 trials, are difficult to
compare. First, various 5-aza doses have been used. Second, most trials added further drugs to the regimen, like
all-trans retinoic acid12,13,15,16 or theophylline.15 Third,
regarding VPA, 2 studies12,13 used a high-dose, intermittent schedule for VPA, whereas others chose a continuous
regimen. Further differences exist regarding the sequence
of VPA and 5-aza as well as the VPA serum levels
achieved. Despite major differences in treatment regimens, a significant influence of VPA serum levels on
response rate and survival was observed by all 3 trials that
reported on this marker.12,14,15 Unfortunately, no
randomized data are available exploring the role of VPA
in combination with 5-aza.
There is a strong need to identify robust, validated
predictive markers (both clinical/hematologic and molecular) for the response to hypomethylating drugs, as
reviewed by Treppendahl et al.19 Thus, in addition to
studies of the predictive value of cytogenetic subgroups
(including the role of the monosomal karyotype), currently, the mutational spectrum of epigenetic modifier
genes (DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2 etc.) is very much in
the focus of activities. Also, translational studies are
ongoing on serially sampled blast cells to determine the
degree of DNA hypomethylation and gene expression
changes induced by azanucleosides and to monitor drug
effects in vivo with the objective of also identifying potential synergisms4,20 on a molecular level.
In this regard, it is perplexing that 1 of the most elementary, well established hematologic parameters for predicting response to AML treatment, ie, the white blood
cell (WBC) count, is not always evaluated as a prognostic
parameter in studies of hypomethylating agents in AML,
as recently remarked by Ferrara and Musto.21 Patients
with leukocytosis usually receive cytoreduction with
hydroxyurea before the initiation of azanucleoside treatment (which is slow-acting and, thus, unable to rapidly
control leukocytosis). With regard to the effects of azanucleosides, the true dynamics of AML with leukocytosis
can best be determined by capturing and evaluating the
elevated WBC count before the initial cytoreduction. This
appears to be all the more relevant considering there are
strong indications that patients who have AML with
hyperleukocytosis have an inferior response to the established doses and schedules of DAC or 5-aza compared
500

with patients who have normal or decreased WBC counts.
Thus, patients who have AML with high leukocyte counts
may need to receive more intensive schedules and doses of
azanucleosides to achieve maximum benefit from such
treatment (see Ferrara and Musto21 and references
therein).
In conclusion, the trial by Issa et al, although it does
not demonstrate a clinical benefit of the DAC plus VPA
combination using the chosen study design and drug
treatment schedule, nonetheless stimulates further systematic exploration of this approach: a randomized study in
the United States is comparing different sequencing of
another HDAC inhibitor drug (see above), and a comparison of DAC alone versus DAC with continuous oral
VPA (sequential dosing starting after the 5 DAC daily
infusions of the first treatment cycle) is being performed
in an ongoing German multicenter trial of older,
treatment-na€ıve patients with AML (DECIDER/AMLSG
14-09; NCT00867672).
