ABSTRACT
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common hematological malignancy
characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of leukemia cells in children.
Discovering and developing effective chemotherapeutic drugs are needed for ALL.
In this study, we investigated the anti-leukemic activity of butein and its action
mechanisms in ALL. Butein was found to significantly suppress the cellular proliferation
of ALL cell lines and primary ALL blasts in a dose-dependent manner. It also induced
cell cycle arrest by decreasing the expression of cyclin E and CDK2. We also found that
butein promoted nuclear Forkhead Class box O3a (FOXO3a) localization, enhanced the
binding of FOXO3a on the p27kip1 gene promoter and then increased the expression
of p27kip1. Moreover, we showed that FOXO3a knockdown significantly decreased
the proliferation inhibition by butein, whereas overexpression of FOXO3a enhanced
the butein-mediated proliferation inhibition. However, overexpression of FOXO3a
mutation (C-terminally truncated FOXO3a DNA-binding domain) decreased the
proliferation inhibition by butein through decreasing the expression of p27kip1. Our
results therefore demonstrate the therapeutic potential of butein for ALL via FOXO3a/
p27kip1 pathway.

major role in anti-leukemic effect [5]. Butein,
3,4,2’,4’-Tetrahydroxychalcone, is a polyphenolic
compound that has been identified from a number of
plants, such as Caragana jubata and Rhus verniciflua
[6]. Recently, butein has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity against breast cancer [7], bladder cancer
[8], prostate cancer [9] and mesothelioma [10]. Butein
has inhibited CXCR4 expression, which is correlated
with the inhibition of CXCL12-induced migration and
invasion in breast and pancreatic cancer cells [11]. In
addition, butein has been found to suppress proliferation,
induce apoptosis and overcome gefitinib-resistance in
lung cancer via EGFR/MET signaling pathway [12].

INTRODUCTION
Although the dramatic improvements in diseasefree survival among children with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) has been achieved, outcomes for those
who fail to achieve long-term disease-free survival
or relapse are poor [1, 2]. Given that the current
chemotherapy regimens have had limited success in
improving survival in refractory or relapsed ALL, the
efforts to investigate potential application of natural antileukemic agents are necessary [3, 4].
Natural products that existing in plants,
such as vincristine, have been shown to play a

Moreover, butein has inhibited the growth of xenografted
human colorectal tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma in
vivo [13, 14]. In addition to solid tumors, butein has been
proved to inhibit telomerase activity and proliferation,
induce apoptosis and differentiation in leukemia cells
through Akt/hTERT pathway [15]. Furthermore, butein
could reverse the TRAIL-resistance of human myeloid
leukemia U937 cells [16]. Although it has been shown that
butein could suppress proliferation, induce apoptosis and
differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells, its molecular
mechanisms responsible for inhibition of cell growth and
cell cycle progression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia are
yet unknown.
In this study, we investigated the effect of butein
on cellular proliferation and cell cycle arrest in ALL cell
lines and primary leukemic blasts from pediatric ALL.
Additionally, we also identify the role of butein in the
regulation of the nuclear translocation of Forkhead Class
box O3a (FOXO3a) and the p27kip1 signaling pathway
in ALL cells. Our results indicate that butein would serve
as a potential candidate targeting FOXO3a to promote
p27kip1 expression for anti-leukemic treatment.

h. As shown in Figure 3A, the growth of B-ALL blasts
was markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The
similar result was obtained in T-ALL blasts (Figure 3B).
Interestingly, treatment with butein resulted in the dosedependent growth inhibition of primary ALL cells, but has
no cytotoxicity in normal mononuclear cells at the same
dose (Figure 3C).

Butein induces cell cycle arrest in ALL cells
We also analyzed the effects of butein on cell cycle
of ALL cells. As shown in Figure 4A, treatment with 0,
50 or 100 μM butein resulted in accumulation of RS4-11
and MOLT-4 cells in S-phase. To explore the underlying
molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by
butein in ALL cells, we detected the effect of butein on
the expression of cell cycle proteins. QRT-PCR analysis
showed a significant down-regulation of cyclin E and
CDK2 in the butein-treated groups in RS4-11 and MOLT4 cells (Figure 4B). Western blot analysis also showed that
butein treatment caused the dose-dependent decreases of
cyclin E and CDK2 proteins in RS4-11 and MOLT-4 cell
lines (Figure 4C). In addition, compared with the control
group, butein treatment resulted in a significant increase
in apoptotic rates and the caspase 3 expression in RS4-11
cell line (Figure 4D).

RESULTS
Butein inhibits the proliferation of ALL cells in a
dose-dependent manner

Butein activates FOXO3a/p27kip1 pathway in
ALL cell lines

The molecular structure of butein was showed in
Figure 1A. To evaluate the effects of butein on the renal
toxicity of human normal proximal tubular cell and the
proliferation of ALL cells, we examined the viability of
HK-2 cell line and ALL cells. As shown in Figure 1B and
Figure 1C, various concentrations of butein remarkably
inhibited the proliferation of the ALL cell lines (RS4-11,
CEM-C7, CEM-C1 and MOLT-4) in a concentrationdependent manner. Compared to ALL cell lines, different
concentrations of butein didn’t remarkably inhibit the
viability of HK-2 cell.

We also tested theinhibition of proliferation of ALL
cells exposed to 0, 25, 50 or 100 μM butein for 24, 48,
and 72 h. Butein significantly inhibited the viability and
proliferation of RS4-11 (Figure 2A), CEM-C7 (Figure
2B), CEM-C1 (Figure 2C) and MOLT-4 (Figure 2D) cell
lines at different treatment times.

The FOXO3a expression has been demonstrated
to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest in
glioma cells [17]. To determine whether butein could affect
FOXO3a signaling pathway in ALL cells, the expression
levels of FOXO3a and p27kip1, one of FOXO3a
downstream target genes, were detected by qRT-PCR and
Western blot. As shown in Figure 5A, butein effectively
increased the expression of FOXO3a and p27kip1 at
mRNA level in RS4-11 and MOLT-4 cells in a dosedependent manner. Similarly, we found that butein also
effectively promoted FOXO3a and p27kip1 expression at
protein level in ALL cell nucleus (Figure 5B).
We further evaluated the effect of butein on the
binding activity of FOXO3a on p27kip1 promoter by
ChIP assay. The results showed that treatment of cells
with butein markedly promoted the binding of FOXO3a
on the p27kip1 promoter in chromatin structure in a dosedependent manner as compared with the control treatment
(Figure 5C).

that FOXO3a and p27kip1 protein expression were both

overexpression increased FOXO3a and p27kip1 mRNA

levels (Figure 7A). The expression of FOXO3a and p27kip1

but FOXO3a mutation decreased p27kip1 protein expression
(Figure 7B). FOXO3a overexpression promoted the
proliferation inhibition by butein at different concentrations,

have led to progressive improvements in survival [4, 18].
However, the treatment of refractory or relapsed ALL
is still challenging [19], whereas prognosis of relapsed
pediatric ALL depends primarily on the time of relapse
after initial therapy, sites of relapse, and immunophenotype
[3, 20]. Efforts to discover several innovative therapies
using novel targeted treatment are necessary [21].
Our previous study revealed that flavokawain B,
one of the flavokawains extracted from kava, exhibited
anti-leukemic activity through the activation of the p53
and caspase-dependent pathways in ALL, it may be a
promising agent for the treatment of patients with ALL
[22]. Based on previous reports suggesting that butein,
a bioactive flavonoid extracted from numerous native
plants, could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis

in numerous human cancer cells [23–27], we analyzed
the anti-leukemic effect of butein on ALL cells. In the
present study, we found that butein effectively inhibited
ALL cells growth with IC50 of about 20 μM, while butein
nearly had no adverse effect on human normal proximal
tubular cells. Unlimitedness of cell cycle progress is a
major cause in proliferation and neoplastic transformation
[28]. Therefore, inducing cell cycle arrest could provide
new opportunities for therapeutic strategies [29]. Our
data showed that butein arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S
transition following 24 hours treatment by decreasing the
expression of cyclin E and CDK2.
The research on the molecular mechanisms of
butein had focused on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [23].
Targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, a

central signaling center of cellular growth and survival,
may have pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects on
hematological malignancies [30, 31]. Recent studies have
shown that combinations of mTOR inhibitors with other
drugs enhanced anti-leukemic activities in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) cells [32–34]. The mTOR inhibitor

BEZ235 overcame glucocorticoid resistance in pediatric
T-cell ALL (T-ALL) by increasing BIM expression [35].
In addition to mTOR pathway, the PI3K/AKT signaling
also targeted the FOXO3a/p27kip1 pathway to suppress
proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest [36]. Our
data showed that butein activated FOXO3a/p27kip1

pathway, the important downstream signaling of PI3K/
AKT pathway, to suppress proliferation and induce cell
cycle arrest in ALL. Targeting the PI3K/AKT/FOXO3a/
p27kip1 pathway and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may
have synergistic effects on ALL. The combinations of
butein with mTOR inhibitors may enhance anti-leukemic
activities in ALL cells.
Recent reports showed that FOXO3a acted as a
transcription factor that inhibited proliferation and cellcycle progression at the G1/S transition by controlling
transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p27kip1 [17, 37–39]. In our study, we showed that butein

promoted nuclear localization of FOXO3a, enhanced the
binding ability between FOXO3a and the promoter of
p27kip1 and then increased the expression of p27kip1,
leading to inhibit proliferation and induce cell-cycle
arrest at the G1/S transition. Furthermore, we showed
that FOXO3a knockdown suppressed the proliferation
inhibited by butein and overexpression of FOXO3a
promoted cellular proliferation inhibited by butein, but
FOXO3a mutation (C-terminally truncated FOXO3a
DNA-binding domain) blocked the proliferation inhibited
by butein. The recent study revealed that FOXO3a DNAbinding domain (FOXO3a-DBD), a FOXO consensus

DNA-binding site, played an important role in promoter
recognition by FOXO proteins and stabilizing the
formation of the complex with DNA [40]. Our data
revealed that the FOXO3a mutation lacking the C-terminal
DNA-binding domain lost the ability to bind the promoter
of p27kip1, leading to decrease the expression of p27kip1.
It indicated that the C-terminal region of FOXO3a-DBD
contributed significantly to the formation of a stable
FOXO3a–p27kip1 complex.

In conclusion, our study showed that butein inhibited
cellular proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in ALL
cells via activating the FOXO3a/p27kip1 pathway. Butein
increased the expression of FOXO3a, enhanced the binding
ability between FOXO3a and p27kip1, and promoted the
expression of p27kip1 (Figure 8). Additionally, butein
significantly suppressed the growth of primary ALL. The
data suggested that butein, used alone or in combination with
other drugs, may be a promising drug for ALL treatment.

cell cycle arrest through activating the FOXO3a/p27kip1 signaling pathway and inhibiting the activation of CDK2-Cyclin E complex.

beta on cysteine 179 residue. The Journal of biological
chemistry. 2007; 282:17340-17350.

After cells plated in 100-mm dishes with different
concentrations of butein for 24 h, they were harvested,
washed and lysed. Whole cell lysates were prepared by
using Complete Lysis-M Reagent Kit (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). Nuclear–cytoplasmic fractionation was
conducted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic
Extraction Reagents kit (Pierce, Illinois, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Proteins were transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The protein bands
were visualized using the SuperSignal Chemiluminescent
Substrates from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
