Abstract
The aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) splice variant designated DX2 is
induced by cigarette smoke carcinogens and is often detected in
human lung cancer specimens. However, the function of DX2 in
lung carcinogenesis is obscure. In this study, we found that DX2
expression was induced by oncogenes in human lung cancer
tissues and cells. DX2 prevented oncogene-induced apoptosis
and senescence and promoted drug resistance by directly binding to and inhibiting p14/ARF. Through chemical screening, we
identiﬁed SLCB050, a novel compound that blocks the interac-

tion between DX2 and p14/ARF in vitro and in vivo. SLCB050
reduced the viability of human lung cancer cells, especially small
cell lung cancer cells, in a p14/ARF-dependent manner. Moreover, in a mouse model of K-Ras–driven lung tumorigenesis,
ectopic expression of DX2 induced small cell and non–small cell
lung cancers, both of which could be suppressed by SLCB050
treatment. Taken together, our ﬁndings show how DX2 promotes lung cancer progression and how its activity may be
thwarted as a strategy to treat patients with lung cancers exhibiting elevated DX2 levels. Cancer Res; 76(16); 4791–804. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

functional interaction between oncogenes and p14/ARF-p53
for cancer progression.
Human lung cancers are divided into two groups, small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), that
are also divided into subgroups, adenocarcinoma, squamous
cell lung carcinoma, and large-cell lung cancer. Among them,
SCLC occupies 20% of lung cancer, is closely linked to smoking
habit, and is very aggressive (12–14). Moreover, until now, we do
not develop proper anticancer drug against SCLC.
AIMP2 is previously known as p38/JTV-1 and cofactor of
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (15, 16). Differentially from
predicted role, housekeeping and scaffolding protein in essential
enzyme complex, AIMP2 shows diverse cellular functions such as
p53 activator and substrate of Parkin (16, 17). Moreover, AIMP2
knock out mouse is neonatal lethal because of defect in lung
epithelial cell differentiation (15).
Recently, exon 2 skipped alternative splicing variant of AIMP2,
AIMP2-DX2 (DX2) has been reported to be highly expressed in
human lung cancer (17, 18) and to be induced by benzo(a)pyrene
(18), a major carcinogen associated with smoking (19). Considering previous literatures, DX2 would be important factor of lung
cancer initiation or progression, and how DX2 contributes to lung
carcinogenesis has not been clearly demonstrated until now. That
report inspired us to examine the role of DX2 in human lung
cancer, in particular SCLC because of tight relationship with
smoking.
In this study, we checked the expression of DX2 in several kinds
of human lung cancer cell lines and revealed that it was highly
expressed in SCLC and stabilized by various oncogenic signaling
including K-Ras or Her2/Neu-AKT activation. Moreover, DX2
blocked the oncogene-induced p14/ARF activation. Thus, we
hypothesized that inhibition of DX2 would be one of plausible
candidate for lung cancer treatment, in particular, SCLC.

Lung cancer is one of the most common human malignancies and is associated with extremely low survival rates (<10%;
refs. 1, 2). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
development of lung cancers remain unclear. Oncogenic mutations such as K-Ras or Her2/Neu and activation of AKT signaling
by altering positive and negative regulators have been suggested
to promote lung cancers (3–7). In fact, ampliﬁcation of Her2/
Neu or oncogenic mutation in K-Ras is found in about 30% of
lung cancer (8, 9), and loss of PTEN is also suggested as one of
important genetic alternation (10). Given that oncogene activation induces p53-induced apoptosis or senescence via p14/
ARF (11), there may be additional factors that disrupt the

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
A549, HCT116, H1299, and HEK293 cell lines were obtained
from the ATCC and maintained in RPMI-1640 or DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H23,
NCI-H322, NCI-H358, and NCI-H460) were obtained from the
ATCC. SCLC cell lines (NCI-H69, NCI-H128, NCI-H209, and
NCI-H146) were newly purchased from Korean Cell line Bank
(KCLB) for this experiment and maintained in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS. MEF cells were isolated from 14.5 day embryos
using a standard protocol and cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 15% FBS and 1% antibiotics. Cell lines were certiﬁed by short
tandem repeat analysis.
Transfection of mammalian expression plasmids and siRNA
The mammalian expression plasmids encoding GFP-p14/ARF
(GFP tagged at N-terminal of full-length p14/ARF) were kindly
provided by Dr. G. Peters (Cancer Research UK, London Research
Institute; ref. 20). The AIMP2-related mammalian expression
vectors (AIMP2 and DX2) and Ras (K-Ras, N-Ras and H-Ras)
were obtained by Dr. S. Kim (Seoul National University, Seoul,
Republic of Korea) and by Dr. S.G. Chi (Korea University, Seoul,
Republic of Korea), respectively (18, 21). pVHL and Siah-1 vectors
were obtained from Dr. Y.J. Jung (Pusan National University,
Busan, Republic of Korea) and from Dr. Lashuel (Qatar Foundation), respectively. Her2/Neu WT, CA (Constitutively Active;
V659E), KD (kinase dead; K753M; ref. 22), and E3 ligases [Skp2
(23), CDC4 (24)] were obtained from Addgene. For in vitro gene
knockdown, siRNAs against target proteins including DX2 (18),
p14/ARF (25), and control (nonsilencing; ref. 26) were generated
by costume service (Cosmo Genetech). Transfection was performed for 24 hours using Jet-pei (Polyplus Transfection) reagent
according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cells, seeded a
day before, were washed with PBS and incubated with DNA/Jetpei mixture for 4 hours within serum-free condition.
Western blot analysis
Protein was extracted from cells in RIPA buffer (150 mmol/L
NaCl, 25 mmol/L Tris-Cl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, containing protease inhibitor cocktail). After heat
inactivation with sample buffer (heated at 95 C for 7 minutes),
proteins were applied to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis,
according to general protocol (27, 28). The antibodies (Ab), used
for this study, are purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology [HA
(sc-7392), His (sc-8036), GFP (sc-9996), GST (sc-138), Actin (sc1616), and p19/ARF (sc-32748)] or Millipore [Anti-p14/ARF
(MAB3782)] or Sigma Aldrich [FLAG-M2 (F3165) and C-Myc
(M5546)]. Anti-AIMP2 was kindly provided from Dr. S. Kim
(Seoul National University).
Mice
All experimental procedures using laboratory animals were
approved by the animal care committee of Pusan National University. DX2 (C57/BL6) and K-RasLA2 (C57/BL6) mice were
obtained from Dr. S. Kim (Seoul National University) and Dr.
K. Choi (Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea), respectively,
and double Tg mice were generated by crossing breeding of DX2
and K-RasLA2 mice. Before experiment, all mice were maintained
under temperature- and light-controlled conditions (20–23 C, 12

4792 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

hour/12 hour light/dark cycle) and provided autoclaved food and
water ad libitum.
Drug treatment in vivo
DK (5-month-old, N ¼ 6) mice were administered with carrier,
SLCB050 (5 mg/kg), Adriamycin (1 mg/kg), and combination of
SLCB050 and Adriamycin by i.p. injection. After termination of
the experiment of each group, mice were dissected and isolated
lung tissues. For xenograft, 1  107 H446 cells were seeded in s.c.
on nude mice. After 4 weeks, tumor-bearing mice were injected
with Adriamycin (5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg), SLCB050 (10 mg/kg), or
combination for 6 weeks. Every week, tumor volume and body
weight were measured.
Histologic analysis
After dissection of mice, tissues were ﬁxed using 10%
formalin in PBS for 24 hours and embedded in parafﬁn blocks
according to a basic tissue processing procedure. For histologic
analysis, embedded tissues were cut for 5 mm by Leica microtome and transferred onto adhesive-coated slides (Marienfeld
laboratory glassware). After deparafﬁn and rehydration, sections were then stained with hematoxylin–eosin for routine
examination.
For IHC staining, rehydrated tissue sections were incubated
with antibodies to ki-67 (Abcam; ab15580), pan-keratin (Sigma;
C2931), pro-surfactant C (Millipore; AB3786), NSE (DAKO;
IS612), and Her2/Neu (DAKO; A0458). Antigen retrieval was
performed using 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0) 2 times at
95 C for 10 minutes each, and endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxidase for 10 minutes. Then,
the slides were dehydrated following a standard procedure and
sealed with cover glass using mounting solution. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) reaction was done as described in the manual for In
Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.).
Chemical library
Personal synthetic chemicals and natural compounds library
has been described previously (27, 28). Korea chemical bank also
provided 8,000 chemicals for this study.
ELISA
To detected p14/ARF-DX2 binding inhibitor, we generated the
screening system based on ELISA. We immobilized His-DX2
recombinant protein on 96-well plate with 0.5% paraformaldehyde. After drying and washing, we incubated GST-p14/ARF protein with 0.1 mmol/L chemicals (ﬁnal concentration). After 1 hour,
plates were washed using TBS-T and incubated with anti-GST
antibody (1:10,000 for 30 minutes) and anti–mouse-IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:50,000 for 1 hour). After washing twice,
plates were incubated with 3,30 ,5,50 tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
solution (Calbiochem) and stop solution (1N H2SO4). Thereafter, using the ELISA reader, we determined the value at
450 nm. More detail information about this ELISA system
could be obtained from our previous literature (28).
Recombinant proteins, immunoprecipitation, and GST pulldown assays
The human p14/ARF fragment (full-length) was ligated
into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the pGEX-TEV vector, which
is a modiﬁed vector by adding a TEV protease cleavage site to

Antitumor Effect of a Novel p14/ARF-DX2 Binding Inhibitor

pGEX-4T1 (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins were expressed
in the Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain BL21 (DE3) as a GST-fusion
proteins. The proteins were puriﬁed by glutathione afﬁnity chromatography. To address the direct binding between two proteins,
agarose bead–conjugated GST (negative control) or GST-target
protein was incubated with cell lysate or recombinant protein in
RIPA buffer for 1 hour at 4 C. Immunoprecipitation (IP) assay
was performed with cell lysate or recombinant protein with RIPA
buffer. The whole lysates were incubated sequentially with appropriated antibodies for 2 hours at 4 C and then the mixtures were
added protein A/G agarose beads–conjugated secondary antibody
(Invitrogen) for 2 hours. After incubation, mixtures were washed
using RIPA buffer 2 times. Precipitated proteins were determined
by Western blot analysis.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
Cells grown on coated cover glasses were ﬁxed with 100%
MeOH for 1 hour at 20 C. After washing with PBS and blocking
in PBS-based buffer [containing nonrelated Goat antibody
(1:500)] to eliminate nonspeciﬁc reaction, cells were incubated
with primary antibodies (1:501:200; overnight at 4 C) and with
proper FITC or Rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies for 4
hours  overnight at room temperature. 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain nuclei. After washing with
PBS, cover glasses were mounted with mounting solution (Vector
Laboratories; H-5501) and subjected to ﬂuorescence microscopic
analysis (Zeiss).
MTT assay
To examine cell viability or proliferation, MTT (3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay
was performed. Cells were incubated in 0.5 mg/mL of MTT
solution for 4 hours at 37 C. After removing solution, formazan
products were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
measured by reading absorbance on a spectrophotometer at
540 nm.
Senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining
Cells grown on coverslips were stained by using a senescenceassociated b-galactosidase staining kit (9860S; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.). In brief, cells, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
were incubated with staining solution for overnight at 37 C
without CO2. Stained cells were observed under light microscope
after mounting with VectaMount solution (Vector Laboratories).
Human lung cancer tissue samples
Eight pairs of frozen human normal and lung cancer tissue
samples were provided by a biobank in Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital (schbc-biobank-2011-003). Part of tissues
was used for extraction of protein, total RNA, and DNA, and
another part was ﬁxed with formalin for tissue analysis. The cDNA
was isolated from normal (N) or tumor (T) regions in the human
lung tissues of total eight cases, and then DX2 transcripts were
checked using PCR with speciﬁc primers. The primer sequences
were as follows: for DX2 (forward 50 -AACGTGCACGGCAGGAGCTAC-30 , reverse 50 -CCAGCTGATAGTCTTGGCGGG-30 ) and
for GAPDH (forward 50 -ATCTTCCAGGAGCGAGATCCC-30 ,
revere 50 -AGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGCTC-30 ). Detection of oncogenic K-Ras mutation was performed by previous literature (29).

Human patient's serum analysis
Human normal, SCLC, and NSCLC patient's sera were also
obtained from a biobank in Soonchunhyang University Bucheon
Hospital (schbc-biobank-2011-003). To test the autoantibodies
against DX2, we attached recombinant DX2, Lamin A, and Snail
onto nitrocellulose membrane (0.5 ng/well). Each membrane
was incubated with patient's serum, diluted with blocking buffer
(1:1,000, for 1 hour), and sequentially HRP-conjugated antihuman antibody (1:20,000) for 30 minutes. Associated Abs to
proteins were visualized by ECL and X-ray ﬁlm exposure. More
detail procedure was available in our previous literature (28).
Analysis of tumor incidence and area
To evaluate tumor incidence, lung tissues of each mouse was
ﬁxed and embedded in parafﬁn. Five sections from each mouse
were examined by three independent investigators who counted
tumor. In addition, tumor area was calculated by tumor occupied
area in total lung area using Photoshop soft wear.
Statistical analysis
To obtain the statistical signiﬁcance, we performed the Student t
test. In addition, to evaluate the signiﬁcant enhanced effect in
combination treatment with SLCB050 and conventional anticancer drug, we compared the simple added effect and real MTT value.

Results
The expression of DX2 in lung cancer tissue and cell lines
To examine the role of DX2 in lung carcinogenesis, we ﬁrst
measured DX2 expression in human lung cancer tissues and
found that, despite strong DX2 transcription even in adjacent
noncancerous tissues, DX2 protein was detected primarily in
cancer tissues with K-Ras-or Her2/Neu-activation (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). This result implied that DX2 expression at
transcription level did not relate to lung cancer progression. We
obtained similar results in human lung cancer cell line analysis
(Fig. 1A). In addition, K-Ras–mutated (A549 and H460) and
PTEN silent (H1299) cell lines showed the elevated DX2 expression. Indeed, activated Her2/Neu, AKT, and oncogenic K-Ras
increased exogenous (Fig. 1B and C; Supplementary Fig. S1C)
and endogenous DX2 expressions without altering DX2 transcription (Fig. 1D). In addition, stabilized DX2 by oncogenes was
translocated into nucleus (Fig. 1E). These results implied that
EGFR-AKT-K-Ras signaling cascade regulates DX2 expression and
localization at posttranscriptional level. So, we next checked the
DX2 protein stability and turnover rate. Rapid turnover of DX2
within 1 hour (Fig. 1F) was extended up to 3 hours by oncogenic
K-Ras (Fig. 1G) or phosphatase inhibitor (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). To reveal the responsible E3 ligase, we examined the effect
of several E3 ligase on AIMP2 and DX2 and found that Siah-1
eliminated DX2 (Fig. 1H). Elimination of Siah-1 could increase
DX2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1E), and Siah-1 showed the
binding ability to DX2 (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Indeed, Siah-1
could promote DX2-Ubiquitinylation (Supplementary Fig. S1G).
Because Siah-1 is transcriptional target of p53 (30), DX2 would be
regulated by p53 pathway negatively and by oncogenic signaling
positively.
DX2 provided drug resistance
Because DX2 was stabilized by oncogenes, we speculated
that it would be related with cell growth and proliferation.

Oncogenic stimulations induce DX2 expression at posttranslation level. A, differential expression of DX2 in human lung cancer cell lines. H322 cells had extremely low
DX2 protein expression (red arrow) despite a transcription level (red arrow) that was similar to those in the other cell lines. In contrast, A549 and H460 cells had high
DX2 protein expression. AIMP2 is indicated by the black arrows. Actin and GAPDH were used as loading controls for transcription and protein expression,
respectively. B, Her2/Neu increases DX2 expression. Wild-type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) Her2/Neu but not KD Her2/Neu induced DX2. In contrast,
AIMP2 was not induced by Her2/Neu. HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated vectors for 24 hours. C, active AKT increases DX2 expression.
HEK293 cells were cotransfected with AIMP2 or DX2 and AKT expression vectors for 24 hours. AKT-CA (myristoylated AKT) selectively induced DX2 expression.
D, oncogenes induce endogenous DX2 in H1299. Transfection with AKT-CA (myristoylated AKT), Her2/Neu-CA, and oncogenic K-Ras into H1299 for 24 hours
could increase endogenous DX2. E, oncogenes promote nuclear localization of DX2. Although transfected DX2 was located in the cytoplasm in HEK293 cells,
AKT-CA and Her2/Neu-CA promoted the translocation of DX2 into the nucleus. In contrast, AKT-KD and Her2/Neu-KD suppressed DX2 expression. F, rapid
turnover of DX2. Compared with AIMP2, DX2 protein showed very short half-life (less than 1 hour). Transfected cells were incubated with cycloheximide
(CHX; 100 mg/mL) for indicated times. G, oncogenic K-Ras extends the half-life of DX2. DX2-transfected HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the indicated Ras
proteins. After 6-hour incubation with MG132 (10 mmol/L) to block protein degradation, cells were incubated with cycloheximide for the indicated times to block
de novo protein synthesis. However, AIMP2 did not affect its half-life by Ras transfection. H, Siah-1 inhibits DX2 expression. Compared with other E3 ligases,
Siah-1 selectively inhibited DX2 expression. However, AIMP2 was not affected by E3 ligases.

Antitumor Effect of a Novel p14/ARF-DX2 Binding Inhibitor

However, in MEF, obtained from DX2 transgenic and KRasLA2/DX2 double transgenic (DK) mice, DX2 did not show
obvious effect on cell proliferation, comparing to oncogenic K-

Ras (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Instead, DX2 expressed MEF
showed the resistance to Adriamycin- or serum starvation–

DX2 provides drug resistance. A, resistance to senescence in DX2 and DK MEF. MEF cells were cultivated in serum-free condition (SF) or in low dose of Adrtreated condition for 48 hours to induce senescence. Compared with wild-type (WT) and K-Ras MEF, which were stained by SA-b-gal and showed the
typical senescent morphology, DX2 and DK cells did not show the obvious response. B, resistance of DX2 and DX2/K-RasLA2 double transgenic (DK) cells to
p53-activating chemical. MEF cells were incubated with 5 mmol/L of GN25, activator of p53 for 6 hours. The obvious reduction of cell viability by GN25 in K-Ras MEF
was completely blocked in DK cells. C, Si-DX2 suppresses cell viability in a p14/ARF-dependent manner. Elimination of DX2 using si-DX2 (0, 1, 5, or 10 mg/mL)
reduced the viability of H1299, H23, and H69 cells, which are p14/ARF positive. In contrast, p14/ARF-null cell lines were resistant to si-DX2. NULL and MT
indicate homozygote deletion and mutant, respectively. D, differential localization of DX2 in lung cancer cell lines. Nuclear DX2 was detected in H1299 cells.
The localization of AIMP2 did not differ between A549 and H1299 cells. E, DX2 blocks oncogene-induced p14/ARF. Increase of p14/ARF by Her2/Neu was abolished
by DX2 transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected with indicated vectors for 24 hours.

Fig. S2B). Indeed, DK MEF cells were completely resistant to
selective p53 activator (GN25; ref. 28) on K-Ras–activated
cells (Fig. 2B). To get more clues for pathologic role of DX2
on cell survival, we measured cell viability after inhibition of
DX2. We found that transfection of siRNA for DX2 (si-DX2)
suppressed cell survival in a p14/ARF-dependent manner
(Fig. 2C; refs. 31, 32). Because oncogenic stress can trigger
p53 activation through p14/ARF (11), we hypothesized that
the oncogenic property of DX2 is related to p14/ARF. Indeed,
p14/ARF seemed to determine the localization of DX2. In p14/
ARF-null cell, overexpressed DX2 was not located in nucleus
(Fig. 2D), even in the same K-Ras–mutated cancer cell line,
HCT116, although DX2 was able to localize in the nucleus or
cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). Moreover, DX2,
but not AIMP2, could block the Her2/Neu-induced p14/ARF
(Fig. 2E).
DX2 contributed to SCLC occurrence
Next, we examined the in vivo oncogenic effect of DX2 using
transgenic mouse model (18). Differentially from AIMP2
knockout mice, which are neonatal lethal due to defect of lung
epithelial cell differentiation (15), DX2 transgenic mice are
viable, suggesting that DX2 overexpression did not affect lung
cell differentiation. Although DX2 transgenic mice did not
produce tumor at 4 months old (Fig. 3A and B), comparing
to K-RasLA2, DK mice bore larger tumor (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3A) with low apoptotic cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, besides commonly detected typical adenocarcinomas in
both K-RasLA2 and DK mice, small nuclear atypical tumors
were detected between blood vessels and airways in DK mice
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3A). To identify these tumors,
we performed the IHC staining with pan-keratin (for squamous
cell cancer; ref. 33), pro-surfactant protein C (for adenocarcinoma; ref. 33), and neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE; for SCLC;
refs. 34, 35). NSE staining was visible in the small cell tumor
region in DK-transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. S3B). We
also observed NSE-positive SCLC cells in tumors of DX2-transgenic mice (6-month-old), but not in K-RasLA2 mice (Fig. S3C).
Small cell cancer mass was increased following age in DX2
transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. S3D and S3E). Indeed, the
tumor cells in DX2 mice had a high mitotic index and ﬁne
granular chromatin (Supplementary Fig. S3F), which are wellknown cellular markers of SCLC (13). We also observed the
NSE expression in primary tumor cells isolated from DX2 and
DK tumors (Fig. 3D). On the basis of histologic features (Supplementary Fig. S3G), we analyzed tumor types in mouse
models and found that DX2 and DK mice could promote
SCLC occurrence (Fig. 3E). In fact, DX2 expression was elevated
in SCLC cell lines at translation level (Fig. 3F and G). Because
SCLC tissues are not available, we could not directly detect the
DX2 expression in human cases. Instead, because DX2 is abnormal gene product and many DX2-positive cancer cells would
be died by necrosis, we measured the DX2 autoantibody in
human patient's sera. Although it is indirect method, we already
tested this method for detection of cancer-speciﬁc protein.
Indeed, DX2-speciﬁc autoantibody was frequently detected in
SCLC sera (9/10 cases) and moderately in NSCLC (10/20 cases),
whereas it was rarely produced in normal sera (1/10; Fig. 3H;
Supplementary Fig. S3H; Supplementary Table S1). These results suggest that DX2 is closely related with lung cancer occurrence and progression, in particular SCLC.

DX2 suppresses p14/ARF
To know the biological role of DX2, we tested the oncogeneinduced p14/ARF. Indeed, Her2/Neu-AKT-K-Ras signaling cascade can induce p14/ARF and promote oncogene-induced apoptosis and senescence, whereas DX2 provided the resistance to
senescence (Fig. 2A) and GN25-induced cell death in K-Ras–
mutated MEF (Fig. 2B). Moreover, stabilized DX2 by oncogenes
was located in nucleus as p14/ARF-dependent manner (Figs. 1G
and 2D). First, we evaluated the expression of p19/ARF, mouse
p14/ARF (36, 37), in DX2-expressed MEF and found that it was
obviously reduced in DX2-expressed MEF (Fig. 4A). Similarly,
elimination of DX2 could increase endogenous p14/ARF in
several kinds of human cancer cell lines including H1299
(Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4A) as well as exogenous
p14/ARF in A549 (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4B). However,
si-DX2 did not increase p14/ARF expression in DX2-negative cell
line (H322; Fig. 4C) and nontransformed cell lines (HEK293 and
L132; Supplementary Fig. S4A). Considering the fact that si-DX2
could induce exogenous p14/ARF, it would be achieved at posttranslational level. In fact, si-DX2 could obviously increase
p14/ARF stability (Fig. 4D) and promote nucleoplasmic location
(Fig. 4E). In addition, DX2 promoted p14/ARF ubiquitination
(Fig. 4F), and MG132, proteasome inhibitor, blocked the DX2mediated p14/ARF reduction (Fig. 4G).
Direct interaction between DX2 and p14/ARF
Our next question is how DX2 suppresses p14/ARF. To address
this, we ﬁrst checked the interaction of them. Cotransfected
DX2 and p14/ARF were recovered in nucleolus (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S4C). We could observe the physiologic interaction of DX2 and p14/ARF through bidirectional IP analysis (Fig.
5B and Supplementary Fig. S4D). Direct interaction between
DX2 and p14/ARF was observed by in vitro GST pull-down assay
using His-DX2– or AIMP2-recombinant protein (Fig. 5C). Interesting feature is that AIMP2 was coprecipitated with GST-p14 when
DX2 was coexisted, indicating that DX2 could bind to AIMP2. p53GST was used for positive control (18). To avoid the nonspeciﬁc
interaction, we also checked the binding of DX2 and GST-Smad4 or
von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL). However, these
proteins did not pull down DX2 (Supplementary Fig. S4E and
S4F). Instead, AIMP2 was precipitated with GST proteins, implying
that AIMP2 would be sticky or multifunctional protein. Actually,
AIMP2 is a cofactor of protein complex (16). These results indicate
that DX2-p14/ARF interaction is speciﬁc event. To conﬁrm the direct
interaction, we re-executed GST pull-down assay using recombinant
DX2 and obtained the same result (Fig. 5D). Because p14/ARF is
very sticky protein (38), we did not exclude the nonspeciﬁc association of DX2 and p14/ARF. So, we re-performed IP analysis with
His-AIMP2 or DX2. In this assay, we observed the selective association of DX2 and N-terminal p14/ARF (Fig. 5E and F).
Isolation of speciﬁc binding inhibitor of DX2 and p14/ARF by
chemical screening
Because DX2 blocks the oncogene-induced p14/ARF induction
(Fig. 2E), we speculated that speciﬁc inhibitor against DX2 and p14/
ARF binding would be useful for anticancer drug. So, we performed
the chemical screening (Supplementary Fig. S5A) through modiﬁed
ELISA system (Supplementary Fig. S5B). After testing of ELISA
system (Fig. 6A), we screened chemical library (Supplementary
Fig. S5C). Because we have screened the same library using other
protein binding inhibitor (Pak1-PUMA binding), we excluded the

DX2 promotes SCLC production. A, tumor incidence in 4-month-old mice. Tumor area was calculated from ﬁve sections per sample. B, hematoxylin–eosin staining of
lung tissues from the indicated transgenic mice (4-month-old). DX2/K-RasLA2 double transgenic (DK) mice had two kinds of tumors. C, DX2 induced resistance
to apoptosis in contrast to numerous TUNEL-positive cells in tumor tissues of K-RasLA2 mice; tumor cells from DK mice were barely stained by TUNEL. D,
immunoﬂuorescence staining with NSE. To conﬁrm that the tumors in DX2 and DK mice were SCLC tumors, tumor cells were isolated from lungs and cultured for
2 weeks to eliminate primary cells such as lymphocytes. Despite serial cultivation, small cells grew well. After ﬁxation with MeOH, cells were stained with NSE.
Normal lung epithelial cells were not stained by NSE and had large nuclei. In contrast, small cells from DX2 or DK mouse tumors were strongly stained by
NSE. Small cells were clearly distinguishable from normal epithelial cell (white arrows). E, Ban diagram of lung tumor spectrum in each mouse model. Lung biopsy
was performed with mice that showed the pathologic symptoms such as dyspnea. Thus, average age (AveAge) of each group was different and represents
approximate onset time. Note that this result contained 4-month-old analysis (Fig. 4A), and some of DX2 single mice were scariﬁed without symptoms. SCLC
was always detected with other kinds of cancers. F, DX2 expression in SCLC cell lines. Two SCLC cell lines had strong DX2 expression like K-Ras–mutated
H460 (red arrowhead). However, AIMP2 expression levels did not differ between NSCLC and SCLC cells. G, analysis of DX2 and AIMP2 transcription, with GAPDH as a

NSCLC sera (indicated in red) but not in sera of healthy individuals. Lamin A and Snail were used as positive controls.

B, si-DX2 induces p14/ARF expression in lung cancer cell line H1299. Cells were transfected with indicated concentration of si-DX2 for 24 hours. Induction of p14/ARF
was detected following dosage of si-DX2. C, si-DX2 increases ectopic expression of p14/ARF. In p14/ARF-transfected A549 and H322 cells, si-DX2 induced
exogenous p14/ARF expression. D, elimination of DX2 increases p14/ARF stability. H1299, transfected with p14/ARF or DX2, was cotransfected with si-DX2 for
24 hours. Protein half-life was measured after treatment of cycloheximide (CHX). E, increase of p14/ARF in nucleoplasm by si-DX2. In GFP-p14/ARF-transfected

at high molecular weight (arrowheads). G, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 mmol/L, 6 hours) reverses DX2-induced p14/ARF suppression and inhibits DX2.

commonly isolated chemicals from candidate (Supplementary Fig.
S5A and S5D). Next, we directly checked speciﬁc inhibition through
GST pull-down assay using DX2-p14/ARF and p53-p14/ARF (Supplementary Fig. S5E and S5F). Finally, we obtained ﬁve chemicals
that were selectively inhibited DX2-p14/ARF. Because we did not
obtain enough amounts of four chemicals for further experiment
instantly, we went to next step with SLCB050 (Fig. 6B) that could
block the interaction of DX2 and p14/ARF more obviously than
SLC24, random protein binding inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S5D
and S5G). Indeed, SLCB050 inhibited DX2-p14/ARF binding in
in vitro GST pull-down assay (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S6A)
as well as IP experiment (Fig. 6D) in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S6B). SLCB050 also blocked the interaction of
DX2 and AIMP2 (Fig. 6E), but not on p53-AIMP2 or DX2 binding
(Supplementary Fig. S6C) and p14/ARF (Supplementary Fig. S6D),
indicating that SLCB050 would be interacted with DX2-speciﬁc
region. To verify that SLCB050 is a speciﬁc inhibitor of DX2-p14/

ARF, we performed the GST pull-down assay with SLCB050 and its
very similar chemicals (HJH141204, HJH141206; stereoisomer)
and related chemical (SLCB036: ribose ring is replaced by modiﬁed
benzene ring; Supplementary Fig. S6E). We also checked the newly
synthesized SLCB050 to exclude the synthetic error. Obvious
inhibition effect on p14/ARF-DX2 binding was observed in
SLCB050, HJH141204, and HJH141206 (Supplementary Fig.
S6F). However, these chemicals did not alter the interaction of
p53-p14/ARF (Supplementary Fig. S6G), and SLCB036 did not
show the inhibitory effect on both binding (Supplementary Fig. S6F
and S6G). These results indicate that unique chemical structure (in
particular, ribose ring) is required for the binding inhibition.
Antitumor effect of the chemical in small-cell lung cancer
cell lines
So, we next examined the effect of SLCB050 in cell system.
Treatment of SLCB050 could block the interaction (Fig. 6F) and

Speciﬁc interaction between p14/ARF and DX2 was observed. Sup, supernatant after IP analysis. Despite strong expression, GFP-nucleolin did not show the

colocalization of DX2 and p14/ARF in nucleus (Fig. 6G). Indeed,
this chemical could suppress DX2 expression itself through rapid
degradation (Supplementary Fig. S7A) and relocalization from
nucleolus to cytosol (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Thus, we could
observe the increase of p14/ARF in SLCB050-treated H1299, H69
(Fig. 6H and Supplementary Fig. S7C), as well as reduction of DX2
in p14/ARF-deﬁcient cell lines (H322, H460, and A549; Fig. 6I;

several lung cancer cell lines and found that p14/ARF-deﬁcient cell
lines were resistant to SLCB050, whereas SCLC cell lines were
sensitive to it (Fig. 6J). In fact, SLCB050 completely suppressed
the H128 cell growth (Fig. 6K and Supplementary Fig. S7D).
Moreover, SLCB050 derivatives, HJH141204 and 1206, but not
SLCB036, also suppressed cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S7E),

Antitumor Effect of a Novel p14/ARF-DX2 Binding Inhibitor

indicating that tumor cell growth suppression is achieved by
chemical-DX2 binding.
The combinational effect of SLCB050 with antitumor drugs
We previously showed that DX2 provided the drug resistance
(Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), and others reported
that p14/ARF is critical for drug sensitivity (39). So, we tested that
SLCB050 could restore the sensitivity to anticancer drug. Resistance to GN25 in DX2 and DK MEF was abolished by cotreatment
of SLCB050 (Fig. 7A). We also observed the signiﬁcant enhanced
effect of SLCB050 with Adr in DX2 and DK MEF (Fig. 7B) and
SCLC cell line H69 that was partially responded to SLCB050 (Fig.
7C). However, p14/ARF-deﬁcient H322 did not show enhanced
response to combinational treatment (Fig. 7C). To extend this, we
generate tumor xenograft model using H446 that was resistant to
Adr and partially responded to SLCB050 (Supplementary Fig.
S7F). Exponentially increased tumor volume was moderately
suppressed by SLCB050 injection (10 mg/kg, 3 times/week;
Fig. 7D and Supplementary Fig. S7G). Although we also observed
the tumor repression effect by injection of 5 mg/kg Adr (3 times/
week), it evoked rapid weight loss and death (Fig. 7D and
Supplementary Fig. S7H). In contrast, combinational treatment
showed more obvious antitumor effect despite low dosage of Adr
(Fig. 7D). Indeed, combinational treatment of Adr and SLCB050
could obviously induce p53 expression in primary tumor cells
obtained from DX2 or DK mouse (Fig. 7E). Next, we tested the
effect of SLCB050 on nontransformed lung cell (L132). However,
this chemical did not alter the cell viability or drug sensitivity
on these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7I). Next, we checked the
effect of combination treatment of SLCB050 with other commercial anticancer drugs such as Taxol and Carboplatin. However,
these chemicals did not show signiﬁcant enhanced effect with
SLCB050 (Supplementary Fig. S7J). These results indicate that
inhibition of DX2 could enhance drug sensitivity through reactivation of p14/ARF in DX2-overexpressed cancer cells.
In vivo antitumor effect of SLCB050
To explore the effect of SLCB050 in mouse model, we injected it into DK mice following our experimental schedule (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Combinational treatment of SLCB050
and low-dose Adr strikingly suppressed tumor progression
(Fig. 7F and G) without signiﬁcant weight loss (Supplementary
Fig. S8B). However, nontoxic dose of Adr did not show anti-

tumor effect on this mouse model (Fig. 7F and G; Supplementary Fig. S8B). More detailed histologic analysis showed that
SCLC region was more obviously erased by combinational
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S8C). In DX2-reduced condition
(Fig. 7H), apoptotic tumor cells were obviously increased
(Fig. 7I and Supplementary Fig. S8D). Our results indicate that
DX2, produced by aberrant splicing of AIMP2, promotes tumor progression, in particular small cell lung cancer, via direct
interaction and inhibition of p14/ARF (supplementary Fig. S9).
Thus, under DX2-expressed conditions, oncogene-induced tumorigenesis would be easily progressed because oncogeneinduced cell death or senescence is abolished.

Discussion
Although DX2 is elevated in human lung cancer (16, 18),
physiopathological role of DX2 has not been revealed. In this
study, we found that DX2 is stabilized by oncogenic stresses
such as oncogenic K-Ras or Her2/Neu-AKT signaling activation
(Fig. 1). Concerning this, siah-1 is speculated as responsible
E3-ligase (Fig. 1H and Supplementary Fig. S1F and S1G). However, we did not exclude the involvement of other mechanism
on DX2 destabilization, because despite Siah-1 knockdown,
AKT can induce DX2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1E) and
phosphatase inhibitor can extend DX2 half-life (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Thus, more intensive investigation on DX2
regulation should be performed, including how DX2 is transcriptionally induced.
Based on differential sensitivity of DX2 transgenic MEF to p53
activators and cellular distribution, we assumed that oncogenic
role of DX2 would be related to nuclear proteins (Fig. 2D) and
drug resistance (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover, the effect of DX2
knockdown is fully dependent on p14/ARF status but not on
p53 status (Fig. 2C). Indeed, si-DX2 can suppress the viability of
H1299, p53-null lung cancer cell line but not that of A549, despite
intact p53 (Fig. 2C). In addition, DX2 blocks the oncogeneinduced p14/ARF expression (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that
oncogenic property of DX2 is tightly related with p14/ARF. In fact,
DX2 suppresses p14/ARF expression (Fig. 4) through direct interaction (Fig. 5).
In general, oncogenic stimulations activate p53 pathway via
p14/ARF and resulted in senescence or apoptosis. Thus, cancer
cells should escape from oncogene-induced cell death or

Isolation of SLCB050 as an inhibitor of DX2-p14/ARF binding. A, ELISA-based screening method. To conﬁrm the validity of the ELISA system, we measured
increases in ELISA values with increasing concentrations (Conc) of p14/ARF (left). One chemical, SLCB050, reduced the ELISA reaction considerably (arrow in the
right panel). B, chemical structure of SLCB050. C, inhibition of the binding of p14/ARF to DX2. A GST pull-down assay showed complete blocking of
DX2-p14/ARF binding by SLCB050. His-DX2 (red arrow) was detected in a higher molecular weight range than AIMP2 (black arrow) was, because His-DX2
recombinant protein was fused with thioredoxin. D, SLCB050 disrupts the interaction of p14/ARF and DX2 in cells. Cotransfected HEK293 cells were
incubated with MG132 before IP analysis to prevent the reduction of both proteins. After incubation with SLCB050 (10 mmol/L, 6 hours), cells were used for IP analysis
with Myc antibody (DX2). IgGH, immunoglobulin G heavy chain. E, inhibitory effect of SLCB050 on the binding between DX2 and AIMP2. In protein binding
assay using His-DX2 protein, binding between DX2 and AIMP2 was reduced by SLCB050 treatment. F, dissociation of DX2 and p14/ARF. Through IP analysis,
dissociation of DX2 and p14/ARF was detected. HEK293 cells were transfected with indicated vectors for 24 hours and incubated with additional 6 hours
with MG132 and SLCB050. G, differences in localization of DX2 and p14/ARF after SLCB050 treatment. Colocalization of DX2 and p14/ARF (top panels) was
disrupted by SLCB050 (10 mmol/L, 6 hours). DX2 was decreased and p14/ARF was increased in the nucleoplasm. H, SLCB050 treatment increases p14/ARF in the
NSCLC cell line H1299 and the SCLC cell line H69. SLCB050 treatment at the indicated concentrations for 6 hours reduced DX2 and increased p14/ARF.
I, dose-dependent reduction of DX2. DX2 levels decreased considerably in the p14/ARF-null H322 cells in response to SLCB050 treatment (6 hours). J, effect of
SLCB050 on viability of human lung cancer cells incubated with the indicated concentrations of SLCB050 for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay.
SCLC cells were very sensitive to SLCB050. K, soft-agar colony formation assay. H128 cells (SCLC cell line) were seeded in soft-agar plates and incubated
with the indicated concentrations of SLCB050 for 48 hours. Cells were visualized by trypan blue staining after ﬁxation. Colonies were counted (bottom).

Antitumor Effect of a Novel p14/ARF-DX2 Binding Inhibitor

senescence. In previous, we revealed that induction of Snail in
response to oncogenic K-Ras suppresses p53 in pancreatic cancer
(27). Similarly, Her2/Neu-AKT pathway inhibits activation of
p14/ARF-p53 network through DX2 induction. However, elimination of DX2 via siRNA or SLCB050 could suppress cell viability
in p53-mutated cells (Figs. 2C and 6J), suggesting that p14/ARF
executes additional tumor-suppressive functions. Indeed, it has
been reported that p14/ARF regulates cell proliferation through
ribosomal RNA processing (40). Thus, we are now investigating
the effect of DX2 on this.
More interesting feature is that DX2 transgenic mice, including DK mice, generate SCLC (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Fig. S3). In previous, SCLC mouse model is p53/pRb double
knockout system (41). Although p53 and pRB are most frequently deleted genes in SCLC, they are also important for
most types of cancers, including NSCLC, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and even in sarcoma (42). Thus, this model has
some limitation for study of SCLC-speciﬁc carcinogenesis.
Although our double transgenic model (DK mice) can induce
SCLC with NSCLC, it would be useful for investigation of
early SCLC carcinogenesis.
For the human study, we were looking for human specimen.
However, unfortunately, we did not obtain the fresh SCLC
tissues, because standard protocol of SCLC does not include
surgery. Instead, we obtained the human serum of SCLC. In our
previous study, some kinds of proteins that are elevated in
human cancer could work as autoantigen (27). Thus, we also
check the DX2 autoantibody in this study. Indeed, we could
detect DX2 autoantibody from SCLC patient's sera (Fig. 3H).
Although it is a prototype at present, more development would
provide a new rapid detection method for SCLC through DX2
autoantibody. Concerning this, we are examining the physiopathological relevance of SCLC and DX2 expression. Because
p14/ARF is inactivated in SCLC without genetic mutation (43),
DX2 may contribute to this.
Because we provide the evidence about interaction of DX2
and p14/ARF, our next step is screening of binding inhibitor
that is required for proof of our concept. Indeed, though ELISAbased chemical screening, we found small chemical inhibitors
against p14/ARF-DX2 binding. This chemical (Fig. 6B) and its
resembling derivatives (Supplementary Fig. S6E) could suppress the interaction of DX2 and p14/ARF (Fig. 6C–G; Supplementary Fig. S6) and cell viability in a p14/ARF-dependent
manner (Fig. 6J). Moreover, these chemicals can induce p14/
ARF expression and suppress DX2 (Fig. 6H and I).

In fact, SLCB050 show enough anticancer effect in small cell
lung cancer cell lines as p14/ARF-dependent manner (Fig. 6J).
We also observed the signiﬁcant enhanced effect with GN25,
activator of p53 through inhibition of Snail-p53 binding (Fig.
7A) or Adriamycin (Fig. 7B–E). However, SLCB050 did not
show even additive effect with EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC
(data not shown) or TAXOL in SCLC (Fig. S7J). These results
suggest that SLCB050 would be related with p53-p14/ARFmediated anticancer signaling. In fact, combinational treatment of SLCB050 and low dosage of Adr could obviously
suppress tumor progression and induce cell death in our
mouse model. This result indicates that inhibition of DX2 is
very attractive target for therapy for SCLC as well as NSCLC.
However, until now, we do not completely understand how
SLCB050 can induce cell death in p53-deﬁcient SCLC (Fig.
7C). To reveal this, we are now checking several possibilities
including p73 activation or blocking of ribosomal RNA
processing.
In conclusion, our results have demonstrated that DX2
promotes SCLC progression by inhibiting p14/ARF and that
SLCB050 can suppress tumor progression by blocking DX2.
SLCB050 may therefore be effective in treatment of lung
cancers.

Antitumoral effect of SLCB050. A, signiﬁcant enhanced effect of SLCB050 with GN25, p53 activator in DX2 and DK MEFs. Resistance to GN25 in DX2 and DK cells was
abolished by SLCB050 treatment. Cells were incubated with 5 mmol/L of GN25 and SLCB050 for 6 hours. The viability was determined by MTT assay. ##, signiﬁcant
enhanced effect by combination treatment. B, signiﬁcant enhanced effect of Adr and SLCB050 on viability of primary tumor cells from DX2 and DK mice. Cell viability
was determined by MTT assay after the cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/mL of Adr and/or 10 mmol/L SLCB050 for 24 hours. ##, signiﬁcant enhanced effect by
combination treatment. C, sensitivity of SCLC cell lines to combination treatment with Adr and SLCB050, compared with the sensitivity of the p14/ARF-null H322 cells.
Only H69 showed the signiﬁcant enhanced effect by combination treatment with SLCB050 and Adr (##). D, tumor-suppressive effect of SLCB050. In xenograft model
using SCLC H446, 10 mg/kg of SLCB050 suppressed tumor growth. Although Adr (5 mg/kg) blocked the tumor growth, within 4 weeks, all of them were ceased by high
toxicity ( ). In contrast, low dose of Adr (1 mg/kg) with SLCB050 obviously suppressed tumor growth without severe toxicity. Chemicals were delivered via i.p injection 3
times per week. E, in primary tumor cells, combinational treatment could induce p53 synergistically. p53 expression was determined by Western blotting.
F, hematoxylin–eosin staining of lung tumor tissues from SLCB050-treated DK mice. Combination treatment with SLCB050 and Adr induced tumor regression.
G, reduction of tumor volume by combination treatment. Compared with tumor areas in age-matched untreated (DMSO) or single chemical-treated DK mice (SLCB050:
5 mg/kg and Adr: 1 mg/kg), tumor areas in mice treated with the combination of SLCB050 and Adr (AdrþSLCB050) were considerably smaller. H, reduction of DX2
expression in mouse lung tumor tissues in response to SLCB050 treatment. I, TUNEL staining in combined treated DK mice lung tissues. Speciﬁc staining on
tumor cells was detected in AdrþSLCB050-treated mice.
