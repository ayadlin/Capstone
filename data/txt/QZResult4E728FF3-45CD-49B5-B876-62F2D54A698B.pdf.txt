ABSTRACT
Background: The PARP inhibitor olaparib was recently granted Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) accelerated approval in patients with advanced BRCA1/2 mutation
ovarian cancer. However, antitumor responses are observed in only approximately 40%
of patients and the impact of baseline clinical factors on response to treatment remains
unclear. Although platinum sensitivity has been suggested as a marker of response to
PARP inhibitors, patients with platinum-resistant disease still respond to olaparib.
Results: 108 patients with advanced BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancers were
included. The interval between the end of the most recent platinum chemotherapy and
PARPi (PTPI) was used to predict response to olaparib independent of conventional
definition of platinum sensitivity. RECIST complete response (CR) and partial response
(PR) rates were 35% in patients with platinum-sensitive versus 13% in platinumresistant (p<0.005). Independent of platinum sensitivity status, the RECIST CR/PR
rates were 42% in patients with PTPI greater than 52 weeks and 18% in patients
with PTPI less than 52 weeks (p=0.016). No association was found between baseline
clinical factors such as FIGO staging, debulking surgery, BRCA1 versus BRCA2
mutations, prior history of breast cancer and prior chemotherapy for breast cancer,
and the response to olaparib.
Methods: We conducted an international multicenter retrospective study to
investigate the association between baseline clinical characteristics of patients with
advanced BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancers from eight different cancer centers and
their antitumor response to olaparib.
Conclusion: PTPI may be used to refine the prediction of response to PARP
inhibition based on the conventional categorization of platinum sensitivity.

INTRODUCTION

mutation ovarian cancer, including the effects of platinum
sensitivity as potential factors that may be used in the
prediction of patients benefit to olaparib. In addition, we
assessed the association between antitumor response to
olaparib treatment and progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS).

The identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2)
genes has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the DNA
repair pathways involved in cancer progression and
has led to the exploitation of the concept of synthetic
lethality in cancer therapy [1, 2]. Poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors were the first to translate
this theory into clinical practice and promise a new
strategy in personalizing cancer therapy. It is now
more than ten years since the publication of the first
preclinical evidence of PARP inhibitor synthetic lethality
in BRCA1/2 mutation cancers. During this time, multiple
clinical trials have investigated the clinical activity of
different PARP inhibitors in a range of cancers. Olaparib
(Lynparza; AstraZeneca) is the most extensively studied
PARP inhibitor in patients with advanced BRCA1/2
mutated ovarian cancer and has now received Food and
Drug administration (FDA) and European Medicines
Agency (EMA) regulatory approval in the relapsed and
maintenance treatment settings, respectively.
The clinical activity of olaparib in patients with
advanced germline BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer has
been assessed in a number of phase I/II trials. Overall,
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
complete or partial responses (CR/PR) or Gynecologic
Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA125 antitumor responses
ranged between 33%-59%, with a clinical benefit rate
(RECIST or GCIG CA125 responses and RECIST stable
disease) of 46-52% [3–7]. The antitumor efficacy of
olaparib in recurrent ovarian cancer is currently being
assessed in the randomized phase III SOLO-3 trial, which
compares olaparib monotherapy to physician’s choice
single-agent chemotherapy in patients with advanced
BRCA1/2 mutated ovarian cancer (NCT02282020).
While phase I/II clinical trials with olaparib have
reported impressive objective response rates in patients
with advanced BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer, not all
patients achieve the same level of benefit to olaparib. This
highlights the need to identify individual patient predictive
biomarkers of response and resistance to guide treatment
decisions. A number of translational clinical studies have
now been initiated to identify molecular biomarkers of
response to olaparib and other PARP inhibitors. Several
studies are investigating the different molecular markers
that might predict for antitumor response to olaparib
and other PARP inhibitors beyond germline BRCA1/2
mutations, including somatic BRCA1/2 mutations,
functional classifiers of homologous recombination
deficiency, gene expression profiling and genomic scarring
signatures [8–12].
Earlier observations from limited clinical data
suggested a potential relationship between prior sensitivity
to platinum-based chemotherapy and antitumor responses
to olaparib [4]. This has led us to investigate the baseline
clinical characteristics of patients with advanced BRCA1/2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
A total of 108 patients with germline BRCA1/2
mutation advanced ovarian cancer from eight cancer
centers who had been treated with olaparib at a dose of
200mg BID or greater were included in our study (Table
1). The median age of patients at enrolment to clinical
trials was 55 years (range 38-79 years). The majority of
patients (83 of 108; 77%) had high grade serous ovarian
carcinoma. Other ovarian cancer subtypes included
endometrioid (8 of 108; 7.4%), clear cell (9 of 108; 8.2%)
and unknown histological subtypes (8 of 108; 7.4%).
Staging at diagnosis was available for 98 of 108 patients:
FIGO stage I (1 of 108, 0.9%), II (10 of 108, 9.3%), III (76
of 108, 70.3%) and IV (11 of 108, 10.2%). FIGO staging
was not available for 10 of 108 (9.3%) patients. Primary
or interval surgical debulking data were available for 78
of 108 (72.2%) patients. 58 (53.7%) patients had optimal
debulking, while 20 (18.5%) patients had suboptimal
debulking surgery at diagnosis. No surgical data were
available for 30 (27.8%) patients. The median number
of prior lines of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer before
commencing treatment with olaparib was 3 (range 1-10).
Of 108 patients, 65 (60.1%) were conventionally defined
as platinum-sensitive, while 38 (35.2%) were platinumresistant at the time of starting olaparib. Platinum response
status for 5 patients (4.6%) was not available. 77 of 108
(71%) patients had germline BRCA1 mutations, while 31
of 108 (29%) patients had germline BRCA2 mutations.
Forty (38%) patients had a past history of breast cancer,
of whom 20 (22.2%) received one previous line of
chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Antitumor responses
Patients who only had one prior line of
chemotherapy prior to receiving olaparib had significantly
higher rates of RECIST CR/PR compared to those who
received more than one prior line of treatment (p=0.005).
No differences in RECIST CR/PR rates were noted
between patients with germline BRCA1 (27.6%) mutations
versus those with BRCA2 (27%) mutations (p=0.31).
There was no association between having a past history of
breast cancer or receiving prior chemotherapy for breast
cancer, and achieving RECIST antitumor responses to
olaparib (Table 2).

The median PFS was 70 weeks for patients who had
achieved RECIST CR/PR with olaparib therapy, compared
to 28 weeks for patients without RECIST CR/PR (logrank, p=0.0004) (Figure 1A). Median OS was 161 weeks
in patients with RECIST CR/PR, compared to 64 weeks
in patients who did not achieve RECIST CR/PR (log-rank,
p=0.0005) (Figure 1B).

CR/PR rate was significantly lower in platinum-resistant

conventionally defined as platinum-resistant still achieved
RECIST CR/PR, suggesting that platinum response status
is not an absolute predictor of response to olaparib.

The median PTPI was 53 weeks (range 4-244
weeks). Median PTPI was significantly longer for patients
with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (68.7 weeks)
compared to patients with platinum-resistant disease
(25.9 weeks) (p<0.0001). Independent of their platinum
response status, patients with PTPI of greater than 52
weeks had higher CR/PR rates than those with PTPI of
less than 52 weeks (42% vs 18%, respectively, p=0.016).

At the time of enrolment to each trial, 64% of
patients were platinum sensitive, while 36% were
platinum resistant. Higher likelihood of RECIST CR/PR
rates were observed in patients with platinum-sensitive
ovarian cancer (35%), in contrast to those with platinumresistant disease (13%) (p=0.02). Although the RECIST

In order to study the association of PTPI with
response , we compared the RECIST response rate
to olaparib in patients who were classed as platinumsensitive before commencing olaparib and had PTPI of
greater than 24 weeks (‘best-responders’), to patients
who were platinum-resistant and had PTPI of less than
24 weeks (‘least-responders’). Fifty-eight patients
were defined as ‘best responders’ and 20 patients as
‘least responders’. The RECIST CR/PR rates achieved
with olaparib with the ‘best responders’ group were
significantly higher than the ‘least responders’ group
(34.5% vs 10%, p=0.04). We did not identify any
association between response to olaparib and other
clinical baseline characteristics, including initial FIGO
staging or cytoreductive surgery.

response rates to PARP inhibitors have been observed
in patients with advanced germline BRCA1/2 mutation
tumors, including those with ovarian cancer [3, 5, 6, 13,
14]. Supplementary Table 1 summarises the different
response rates observed in patients with advanced
BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer treated with olaparib
in clinical trials. These trials confirmed the impressive
activity of olaparib in patients with recurrent BRCA1/2
mutant ovarian cancers, even in a proportion of patients
with platinum-resistant disease [3–7]. A recent pooled
analysis of data from six clinical trials with olaparib in
BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer patients has confirmed
responses in both platinum sensitive and platinum resistant
patients, but also describes a category of “platinum status
unknown” (response rates in these 3 categories are 48%,
28% and 35% respectively). The authors comment on the
challenge of determining platinum status in platinumresistant patients who receive another non-platinum
treatment which may be effective and are then treated with
olaparib. [15].
A number of prospective and retrospective studies
are currently ongoing to identify molecular biomarkers
that may predict antitumor response to olaparib and
other PARP inhibitors [8–12, 16]. While prior sensitivity
to platinum-based chemotherapy has been reported to
predict antitumor responses to olaparib, in our data set, 5
(13%) platinum resistant patients responded to olaparib,
suggesting that platinum sensitivity status may not be
sufficiently robust as a predictor of response to olaparib.

DISCUSSION
In this international multicenter retrospective study,
we investigated the baseline clinical characteristics that
may predict for antitumor responses to treatment with
the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients with advanced
BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer.
The hypothesis underlying the concept of synthetic
lethality is that patients harboring deleterious germline
BRCA1/2 mutations have homologous recombination
deficient tumors, which may be treated effectively with
PARP inhibitors [1, 2]. However, despite this, variable

Data from our study suggest that PTPI appears to be an
additional clinical indicator of antitumor response to
olaparib treatment, which may also be potentially
applicable to other PARP inhibitors.
PTPI may be a useful indicator for informing both
timing and sequence of non-platinum containing treatment
regimens during the treatment journey of patients
with advanced BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer. Our
data suggest that patients with a longer platinum-free
interval, even after becoming resistant to platinum-based
chemotherapies, are more likely to respond to olaparib
and potentially other PARP inhibitors. This is consistent
with some studies, which have suggested that a longer
platinum-free interval may increase antitumor response
rates to subsequent treatment, including rechallenging
patients with platinum-based therapy [17, 18]. It may
therefore be useful to modify the current classification
of platinum sensitivity status, which is based on the
response to the most recent platinum-based chemotherapy,
which could be many months before the patients’ next

treatment regimen. While we do not recommend using the
PTPI as a sole clinical decision tool, the findings of this
study warrants further investigation, ideally prospective
validation, to assess the association of PTPI with response
to olaparib and other PARP inhibitors in patients with
advanced BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancers.
It has previously been speculated that the antitumor
response to olaparib may be different in patients who have
germline BRCA1 versus BRCA2 mutations [19]. In this
retrospective study involving 78 patients with germline
BRCA1 mutations and 30 with BRCA2 mutations, no
differences in antitumor response was observed between
both groups of patients. Details on the specific BRCA1/2
gene mutations and their association with response to
olaparib were not collected. This requires a larger series
of patients that may further explain the lack of antitumor
responses to PARP inhibitors in patients with advanced
BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer.
Despite this being one of the largest retrospective
series of clinical data from patients with advanced

BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer treated with the PARP
inhibitor olaparib, a limitation of this study was the
involvement of a relatively small series of patients that
prevented further statistical analysis such as regression
analysis. Future studies with a larger data set will enable
linear analysis to be undertaken to identify a more
precise PTPI fit model to predict antitumor response to
PARP inhibitors. The patients in our study have mostly
undergone several lines of chemotherapy, so it is still
possible that there is a population of either BRCA1 or
BRCA2 patients who are excellent responders to first line
chemotherapy and don't need olaparib or alternatively
some who are very platinum resistant and don't survive
to get olaparib.
The accelerated approval of olaparib by the FDA
and EMA in patients with advanced BRCA1/2 mutation
ovarian cancer (without specific platinum sensitivity
status, FDA) heralded a new era in precision medicine
in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Several other
PARP inhibitors are currently at different stages of clinical
development in patients with BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian
cancer. Despite this, improved strategies for selecting
patients who may benefit most are urgently required,
including clinical factors that can be implemented easily
without additional delays, costs or logistical issues. We
have shown that PTPI may potentially be an important
clinical biomarker that should be considered when treating
patients with advanced BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer
with a PARP inhibitor, and warrants further investigation
either in conjunction with or independent of conventional
platinum response status.

Baseline patient characteristics were collected
and entered into a standardized database; these included
details on demographics, surgical debulking, BRCA1/2
status, prior chemotherapy, platinum-based chemotherapy
sensitivity status at the time of enrolment, prior history
of breast cancer or treatments received for breast cancer,
RECIST and GCIG CA125 responses, survival, response
rates and the interval between last platinum-based
chemotherapy to the start of olaparib treatment.
Patients were defined as platinum-sensitive or
platinum-resistant when the platinum-free interval was
more than 12 months or less than 6 months, respectively
[22]. Patients with a platinum-free interval of between
6 to 12 months (partially platinum-sensitive) were also
classified as platinum-sensitive in this study. Platinumcontaining chemotherapy was not necessarily the most
recent antitumor treatment that patients had prior to
receiving olaparib. We therefore also recorded the time
interval between the end of last platinum-containing
chemotherapy regimen and the start of olaparib treatment,
termed the platinum-to-PARP inhibitor interval (PTPI), as
a separate clinical parameter.
Pearson Chi2, odds ratios (OR) and Fisher’s exact
probability tests were used for statistical analyses. Survival
curves were generated using GraphPad Prism 6.

of olaparib from previous studies, where doses of 200 mg
BID resulted in significant target inhibition and antitumor
responses [20, 21]. This study did not include any patient
who had received olaparib in the maintenance treatment
