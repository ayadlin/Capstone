ABSTRACT
Microtubules (MTs) are components of the cytoskeleton made up of polymerized
alpha and beta tubulin dimers. MT structure and function must be maintained
throughout the cell cycle to ensure proper execution of mitosis and cellular
homeostasis. The protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN13, localizes to distinct
compartments during mitosis and cytokinesis. We have previously demonstrated
that the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein binds PTPN13 and leads to its degradation. Thus,
we speculated that HPV infection may affect cellular proliferation by altering the
localization of a PTPN13 phosphatase substrate, EphrinB1, during mitosis. Here
we report that EphrinB1 co-localizes with MTs during all phases of the cell cycle.
Specifically, a cleaved, unphosphorylated EphrinB1 fragment directly binds tubulin,
while its phosphorylated form lacks MT binding capacity. These findings suggest that
EphrinB1 is a novel microtubule associated protein (MAP). Importantly, we show that
in the context of HPV16 E6 expression, EphrinB1 affects taxane response in vitro. We
speculate that this reflects PTPN13’s modulation of EphrinB1 phosphorylation and
suggest that EphrinB1 is an important contributor to taxane sensitivity/resistance
phenotypes in epithelial cancers. Thus, HPV infection or functional mutations of
PTPN13 in non-viral cancers may predict taxane sensitivity.

INTRODUCTION

various modifications peppered along their length.
Such variability in extent and composition of tubulin
modifications translates into a rich complexity that dictates
MT function, stability and associations with microtubule
associated proteins, or MAPs [2]. MAPs directly bind
tubulin and themselves undergo modifications that
regulate their functions and associations. For example,
phosphorylation of MAPs functions as an on/off switch
such that when phosphorylated, MAPs lose their
association to MTs [5-7]. In fact, phosphorylation is an
important example of how kinases and phosphatases
regulate mitosis. However, while much is understood
regarding the function of kinases during mitosis, much
less is clearly defined regarding the opposing functions of
phosphatases [8-15].
The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN13 (PTPBL
is the murine ortholog) localizes at centrosomes from
interphase through metaphase and dramatically shifts
to the spindle midzone during anaphase. At telophase,

Mitosis is a complex sequence of highly regulated
events that ensures the proper segregation of sister
chromatids into daughter cells. At the heart of the mitotic
machinery lie the microtubules (MTs), components of
the cytoskeleton made up of polymerized alpha and beta
tubulin dimers [1]. MTs critically modulate cell shape,
structure and movement during interphase and elaborate
the mitotic spindle at mitosis. Thus, MT structure
and function must be maintained throughout the cell
cycle. Moreover, their contribution to such a diverse
array of cellular functions requires strict regulation.
As such, alpha and beta tubulin are subjected to a host
of post-translational modifications (e.g. tyrosination/
detyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation, actetylation/
deacetylation, and phosphorylation ([2] [3] [4]) that
generate distinct subpopulations of MTs; some MTs
uniformly modified throughout, while others display

RESULTS

PTPN13 accumulates at the midzone, concentrating at
the center of the midbody during cytokinesis. PTPN13’s
localization to specific sites along the mitotic spindle
suggests that it regulates distinct aspects of mitosis and/
or cytokinesis [16-18] . Interestingly, decreased PTPN13
expression correlates with changes in cellular proliferation
and invasive characteristics in multiple epithelial cells in
vitro as well as in tumors in vivo. Taken together, these
data suggest not only that PTPN13 is a tumor suppressor,
but also that loss of PTPN13 expression or function affects
mitosis [19-27]. Its localization pattern throughout the
cell cycle is consistent with this idea and suggests that
PTPN13 may directly regulate mitosis.
PTPN13’s five PDZ domains mediate associations
with a variety of different cellular components [17, 18]
. One of these PTPN13 binding partners, EphrinB1, is
also a phosphatase substrate. EphrinB1 belongs to a
family of ligands which bind and activate Eph receptor
tyrosine kinases [28]. Ephrin ligands are unique;
following Eph receptor engagement, Ephrins themselves
become activated and initiate their own downstream
signaling termed “reverse signaling” [29, 30] . Moreover,
recent studies suggest that Ephrin ligands play a role
in oncogenesis and/or metastasis [28, 31, 32]. Given
PTPN13’s localization to distinct compartments during
mitosis/cytokinesis together with newly appreciated
functions of Ephrin ligands in oncogenesis/metastasis, we
hypothesized that EphrinB1 contributes to the processes
of mitosis and/or cytokinesis where PTPN13 stands
poised to regulate its activation. Here, we report that
EphrinB1 co-localizes with MTs during all phases of
the cell cycle. Specifically, an unphosphorylated cleaved
fragment of EphrinB1 directly binds tubulin. Interestingly,
phosphorylated EphrinB1 appears to be excluded from
MT structures. Upon mitotic entry, EphrinB1 localizes
to the centrosomes and mitotic spindle from prophase
through telophase. At cytokinesis, EphrinB1 localizes to
the midbody except at the point immediately at the center,
where PTPN13 resides [16]. This novel description of
EphrinB1 localization, its tubulin binding capacity
and documented roles in carcinogenesis are consistent
with functional regulation of mitosis. Importantly, we
questioned whether increased expression of EphrinB1
correlates with sensitivity to taxanes while its absence
confers resistance. Finally, we examined if EphrinB1
also localized to mitotic figures in human cancer samples.
Together, these data will elucidate the role EphrinB1
plays as a novel MAP and its potential implications into
responses to anti-microtubule therapy agents like taxanes.

EphrinB1 immunolocalizes in a microtubulelike pattern and co-localizes with alpha and beta
tubulin
The focus of the laboratory is head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Thus, to assess
the localization of EphrinB1 during the cell cycle, the
human squamous cell carcinoma cell line, SCC1, was
processed for co-immunofluorescence (IF) with an
antibody recognizing alpha and beta tubulin and one
specific for EphrinB1. All cells express EphrinB1 (red)
which co-localizes (yellow, merge) with alpha/beta tubulin
(green) (Figure 1A). Importantly, EphrinB1’s mesh-like
localization pattern at interphase is reminiscent of the MT
network and co-localizes with alpha/beta tubulin staining
(Figure 1A, merge, yellow). However, cells in mitosis
show robust EphrinB1 staining of the mitotic spindle
(arrows).
Twenty-five per cent of HNSCCs are caused by
infection with high risk human papillomavirus (HPV).
Thus, to determine whether EphrinB1’s pattern of
localization changes with HPV infection we next asked
whether HPV positive (HPV+) SCC47 cells showed a
similar pattern of staining. Like to the HPV negative
(HPV-) SCC1 cells, SCC47 cells demonstrate EphrinB1
expression (Figure 1B, red) which also co-localizes with
alpha/beta tubulin (Figure 1B, green; merge, yellow) and
strongly labels the mitotic spindle (Figure 1B, arrows).
The specificity of staining was verified by omission of
primary antibodies which resulted in a lack of staining
(labeled as control for figures 1A and B). In addition, to
further validate that this pattern of EphrinB1 localization
was not an artifact, several anti-EphrinB1 antibodies from
different commercial sources were used for IF with similar
results. An example is given in figure 2A where HeLa cells
are stained with a rabbit anti-EphrinB1 antibody from
AnaSpec.
To define whether EphrinB1 localizes at the mitotic
spindle in other epithelial cells, additional cell lines were
similarly analyzed. Robust EphrinB1 immunofluorescence
was evident at the mitotic spindle in two breast cell lines,
MCF-7 (Figure 2B) and MDA-MB468 (Figure 2C).
In addition, we found that this pattern of staining is not
limited to human cells as it is also present in a previously
characterized mouse model of HPV+ HNSCC called
MEERL cells [33]; similar to human cells, EphrinB1
strongly stains the mitotic spindle in these HPV+ cells
(Figure 2D). These data suggest that EphrinB1 localization
at the mitotic spindle is similar in human and murine cells.
The most convincing way to demonstrate that
EphrinB1 localization at the mitotic spindle is real,
would be to generate cells knocked-down for EphrinB1

expression and show loss of spindle localization.
Therefore, we generated MEERL cells stably overexpressing (wtEphrinB1); using an EphrinB1 targeting
shRNA, we also generated cells stably knocked-down for
EphrinB1 expression (shEphrinB1). Several clones were
tested with similar results. Surface staining of EphrinB1
demonstrates increased expression in wtEphrinB1 cells

relative to the parental cell line (Figure 3A). Interestingly,
while surface EphrinB1 protein expression was knocked
down in the shEphrinB1 cells relative to the parental cell
line (Figure 3A, surface EphrinB1), total EphrinB1(surface
and intracellular) was unaffected (Figure 3A, total
EphrinB1). Western blot analysis of cell lysates made from
these stable cell lines similarly demonstrate that stable

over-expression of EphrinB1 (wtEphrinB1) increases total
levels of the protein relative to the parental line. However,
its stable knock-down (shEphrinB1) fails to show an
obvious decrease in total protein expression (Figure
3B). Repeated attempts to generate cells in which both
surface and intracellular EphrinB1 were knocked-down
were unsuccessful. These data suggest that while cells can
tolerate loss of surface EphrinB1 expression, they cannot
tolerate its complete loss. This observation is consistent
with those of Davy et al in their study of the EphrinB1
null mouse [34]. In that study, live EphrinB1 null mice
were not recovered in the expected Mendelian ratios
demonstrating some level of embryonic lethality with loss
of EphrinB1. In addition, despite the fact that EphrinB1 is
X-linked, hemizygous females (which retain half a dose
of EphrinB1) showed the same perinatal lethality as males
(with no EphrinB1). These data emphasize the requirement
for EphrinB1 in normal development and are consistent
with our studies demonstrating that while some EphrinB1
loss can be tolerated (e.g. loss of surface EphrinB1 in

shEphrinB1 cell lines or half dose as in hemizygous
female mice), complete loss is much less tolerable.

EphrinB1 co-localizes with gamma tubulin
Herrmann et al showed that EphrinB1’s
phosphatase, PTPN13, co-localized with the centrosomal
marker, gamma-tubulin [16]. To determine whether
EphrinB1 similarly co-localizes with gamma-tubulin,
MEERL (Figure 4A) and MDA-MB468 cells (Figure 4B)
were processed for IF. Similar to PTPN13, EphrinB1(red)
co-localizes with gamma-tubulin (green; merge: yellow,

as ecto-domain shedding. This cleavage generates a
C-terminal, membrane tethered fragment (CTF, 14-17
kD) which is further processed by gamma-secretase,
liberating the intracellular domain (ICD) [35] . Such
complex processing suggests that spindle-associated
EphrinB1 may not be composed of the full length protein.
Therefore, to determine the composition of spindleassociated EphrinB1, SCC1 (HPV-) cells were processed
for IF using anti-EphrinB1 antibodies that recognize
distinct epitopes. Figure 6A demonstrates staining of
EphrinB1 with an antibody recognizing an intracellular
epitope which strongly stains the mitotic spindle (red,
dotted circle denotes cell in mitosis). In contrast, when
cells were stained with an anti-EphrinB1 antibody whose
epitope is EphrinB1’s extracellular domain, spindle
staining was lacking though membrane and cytoplasmic
staining were evident as puncta (Figure 6B). These data
suggest that the extracellular epitope is not present at the
spindle. Figures 6C and D show staining using phosphospecific EphrinB1 antibodies (the antibody used in panel
C is specific to phosphorylated tyrosine 331 while the one
in panel D is specific to phosphorylated tyrosine 317 of
EphrinB1). These antibodies were utilized simply because
they were the few commercially available antibodies
with phospho-specific EphrinB1 epitopes that worked
for IF localization studies. Neither antibody stained the
spindle in mitotic cells (dotted circle) though staining at

arrows; Figure 4A and B). Taken together, the data suggest
that upon entry into mitosis, the majority of EphrinB1
concentrates to the mitotic spindle and also co-localizes
with gamma tubulin at centrosomes.

EphrinB1 staining throughout the cell cycle
EphrinB1’s localization at the mitotic spindle
prompted us to determine its localization through all
phases of the cell cycle. Figure 5 shows that in SCC1
(HPV-) cells, EphrinB1 localizes throughout the cytosol
at interphase, concentrating among condensed chromatin
in prometaphase, and strongly staining the mitotic spindle
from metaphase through anaphase. Towards the end of
telophase, EphrinB1 staining again concentrates such that
at cytokinesis, robust EphrinB1 staining is found along the
midbody except at its very center where EphrinB1 staining
is lacking (arrow). Curiously, this point of EphrinB1
absence is exactly the point of localization reported for
PTPN13 [16].

The extracellular domain of EphrinB1 does not
localize to the mitotic spindle

cleaved by matrix metalloproteases in a process known

processed for immunofluorescence using antibodies for epitope mapping. The mitotic spindle immunostains when using an antibody
whose epitope is intracellular (A), however, an antibody whose epitope is extracellular (B) fails to stain the spindle. Antibodies to phosphoEphrinB1 epitopes (Tyr 331, C) (Tyr 317, D) also fail to stain the spindle. Scale bar, 10 um. DaPi (blue), nuclear counterstain.

the membrane was evident for each. These data suggest
that EphrinB1 phosphorylated on tyrosines 317 or 331
is excluded from the mitotic spindle, consistent with the
published literature suggesting that PTPN13 localizes
within the spindle and centrosomes [16, 36]. Taken
together, these data suggest that full length EphrinB1 is
not associated with the mitotic spindle, but that rather a
cleaved, unphosphorylated cytoplasmic fragment is the
predominant spindle-associated form.

within human tissue would further support a microtubule
associated function in vivo. To test this, HNSCC tumor
sections were processed for immunohistochemistry
(IHC) with an EphrinB1 antibody. Figure 7 shows three
examples, panels A-C, of mitotic figures (dashed box, and
enlarged inset) within tumor that stain the mitotic spindle,
similar to that evident in vitro. To verify the specificity
of antibody staining, tumor sections were pre- incubated
with a blocking peptide corresponding to the epitope
recognized by the antibody. IHC staining of these sections
resulted in a lack of staining (Figure 7D). These data
suggest that the mitotic spindle staining evident in cells in
vitro occurs human tumors in vivo.

Phosphorylated EphrinB1 is excluded from the
mitotic spindle

when compared to EphrinB1’s localization when using
a non-phospho-specific EphrinB1 antibody (Figure 8D
, EphrinB1 red, gamma tubulin green, co-localization,
yellow). These data are consistent with PTPN13’s colocalization with gamma-tubulin [16] .

To further assess the localization of phosphorylated
EphrinB1, SCC1 cells were processed for IF with an
anti-phosphorylated EphrinB1 antibody that recognizes
additional phospho-tyrosines (tyrosine 324 and 329).
At interphase, phosphorylated EphrinB1 (red) exists as
puncta predominantly at the cell surface but also within
the cytoplasm (Figure 8A). This is in stark contrast to the
localization of EphrinB1when using an antibody that is
not phosphorylation specific (Figure 8B, mesh-like pattern
of staining). This antibody’s epitope is intracellular.
Therefore, it may theoretically recognize cleaved ,
full length, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated
forms of EphrinB1. Alternatively, the epitope may be
best exposed following processing of EphrinB1 and
thus it may preferentially bind only cleaved forms of
the protein; yet may recognize both phosphorylated
and non-phosphorylated forms. Given the significant
difference in its staining pattern relative to that of a
phospho-specific antibody (Figure 8A), this antibody may
recognize predominantly non-phosphorylated forms of
EphrinB1 (Figure 8B). During mitosis, phosphorylated
EphrinB1(red) becomes largely excluded from the
mitotic spindle and does not co-localize with gammatubulin (green) or associate with condensed chromatin
(blue) (Figure 8C). Again, this localization is striking

A cleaved fragment of EphrinB1 directly binds
MTs
The data suggest that a cleaved, intracellular, nonphosphorylated fragment of EphrinB1 associates with
MTs. To further validate this finding, the intracellular
domain of EphrinB1 (ICD) was cloned and transfected
into HEK293 cells. Immunolocalization using EphrinB1
antibodies that recognize intracellular epitopes were
used to localize the ICD. Unfortunately, no staining was
evident suggesting that these epitopes are conformational
and unable to detect the exogenously expressed ICD (data
not shown). Thus, an alternative approach was taken to
test the binding of EphrinB1’s intracellular domain to
microtubules. A tubulin spin-down assay was performed.
HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-taggedEphrinB1 deleted of its extracellular domain (FLAGEphrinB1∆ED). Twenty-four hours later cells were
harvested, lysed and EphrinB1 was immunoprecipitated
(IP) using an anti-FLAG antibody. Bound EphrinB1
protein was recovered via competitive elution with 3X
FLAG Peptide and the eluted protein was pre-cleared by

centrifugation prior to tubulin binding assays.
The tubulin spin down assay uses pre-formed
microtubules as a substrate to test whether a protein
of interest binds to tubulin. Centrifugation separates
bound (pellet) and non-bound (supernatant) fractions.
As controls, MAP2, a known microtubule associated
protein, was added in one condition while bovine serum
albumin (BSA), which has no MT binding capacity,
was added as a negative control. These samples were
centrifuged to separate soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions
which were further subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained
with coomasie. Figure 9A demonstrates these control
conditions. As expected, tubulin was found predominantly
in the pellet fraction (Figure 9A, P1). Similarly, MAP2
was found to pellet with MTs (Figure 9A, P2) while BSA
was found exclusively in the soluble fraction (Figure 9A,

S3).

To test whether EphrinB1∆ED has MT binding
properties, the eluted protein was incubated with or
without pre-formed MTs, the samples were centrifuged,
separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot
using an anti-FLAG antibody. Figure 9B demonstrates
that in the absence of MTs, the majority of EphrinB1∆ED
is found in the soluble fraction (Figure 9B, S2). In the
presence of MTs, however, the majority of EphrinB1∆ED
is found in the pellet (Figure 9B, P1). These data suggest
that EphrinB1 has microtubule binding characteristics.
The interaction between EphrinB1 and tubulin was
further assessed biochemically via co-IP of the endogenous
protein from SCC1 (HPV-) cells. As fluorescent staining
of EphrinB1 exhibited a pattern consistent with mitotic
MT’s, we included conditions to enrich for dividing

cells. SCC1 cells were synchronized to G0 by serum
starvation, released from quiescence by serum repletion
and incubated further to allow entry into mitosis. At this
point, cells were subjected to three rounds of mitotic shake
off to harvest mitotic cells. Mitotic cells were collected,
lysed and IP’d for EphrinB1. The remaining adhered cells
were later lysed and further processed to isolate soluble
and insoluble fractions. This additional processing was
performed to define where in adhering, non-mitotic cells
EphrinB1 resides. Inclusion in the insoluble fraction
would suggest that it resides with MTs. In addition, whole
cell lysates of SCC1 cells were harvested as an additional
control. EphrinB1 was IP’d from each fraction (mitotic,
soluble and insoluble) and analyzed by western blot.
EphrinB1 co-IPs with α/β tubulin as well as γ
tubulin (Figure 9C). Consistent with the tubulin spin
down data, the majority of tubulin (α, β, γ) is present in the
insoluble fractions (Figures 1,2,4-8). Interestingly, while α
tubulin associates with EphrinB1 in whole cell lysates and
insoluble fractions, it is not enriched in mitotic fractions.
However, western blot analysis using an antibody that
recognizes both alpha and beta tubulin demonstrates coprecipitation with EphrinB1. These data suggest that either
EphrinB1 associates with beta tubulin (rather than alpha
tubulin) or that it interacts with an epitope made up of
alpha and beta tubulin dimers.

the cells more sensitive to the drug as compared to the
parental line. Conversely, these curves shift to the left in
shEphrinB1 cells (Figure 10C) suggesting that knockdown of EphrinB1 correlates with increased resistance to
paclitaxel.
Taken together, these data suggest that the ratio of
phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated EphrinB1 can alter
paclitaxel response such that too little non-phosphorylated
EphrinB1 correlates with paclitaxel resistance.
As an additional measure of EphrinB1’s role
in paclitaxel response, a colony forming assay was
performed. MEERL parental, wtEphrinB1 and shEphrinB1
cells were again treated with three different doses of
paclitaxel for 5 days and the ability of cells to form
colonies analyzed (Figure 11). MEERL parental cells
demonstrated a dose response to paclitaxel treatment with
decreasing colony formation as drug dose increased. A
similar trend was evident with MEERL wtEphrinB1 cells.
MEERL shEphrinB1 cells were resistant to paclitaxel

PTPN13 and EphrinB1 expression correlate with
sensitivity to taxanes
Chemotherapeutic agents that interfere with mitosis
are used clinically to treat many types of cancers; these
taxanes either stabilize or destabilize MTs and, in doing
so, lead to cell cycle arrest and eventual cell death [37,
38] . One such taxane, paclitaxel, irreversibly binds beta
tubulin, promoting MT assembly and interfering with
formation and function of the mitotic spindle.	
Using different human and mouse cell lines
(including MEERL, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468,
HEK293, HaCaT cells), we have previously demonstrated
that the absence of PTPN13 expression correlates with
increased EphrinB1 phosphorylation [39] . To more
directly assess the role of EphrinB1 in mitosis, it was
stably over-expressed or knocked-down in MEERL
cells (wtEphrinB1 and shEphrinB1 respectively) and
tested as follows. Cells were seeded onto microtiter
plates and, using the Xcelligence system, their electrical
impedance analyzed continuously as an indirect measure
of proliferation [40-42]. Different doses of paclitaxel were
added every 24 hours (arrows) for 3 days and impedance
measured over the course of 6 days. While parental
MEERL cells respond in a dose dependent manner to
paclitaxel treatment (Figure 10A), the cell index curves
shift to the right in wtEphrinB1 cells (Figure 10B)
suggesting that over-expression of EphrinB1 renders

molecules possess a rich variety of functions relevant in
health and disease. The present study describes EphrinB1
within the mitotic spindle of both human and mouse
epithelial cancer cells. This previously unappreciated
localization suggests that EphrinB1 may function as a
microtubule-associated protein; alternatively, it may
interact with a true MAP indirectly associating with MTs.
Consistent with this, we show that EphrinB1 sediments
with tubulin and co-localizes with alpha and beta tubulin.
In addition, EphrinB1 concentrates at centrosomes colocalizing with gamma-tubulin. Moreover, EphrinB1
localizes at the mitotic spindle upon entry into mitosis
where it persists till the end of cytokinesis. Interestingly,

we found that during mitosis and cytokinesis,
EphrinB1’s localization is complementary to that of its
phosphatase, PTPN13. Consistent with this, we find that
phosphorylated EphrinB1 is predominantly excluded
from the spindle suggesting that restriction of EphrinB1mediated signaling is important, if not required, for
proper execution of mitosis and/or cytokinesis. We have
previously demonstrated that EphrinB1 signals down the
MAP Kinase pathway and that knock-down of EphrinB1
attenuates phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in HEK293 cells
[39] . Importantly, strict modulation of Erk1/2 is required
for maintaining fidelity of the cell cycle [43, 44]. Thus,
our findings that EphrinB1 phosphorylation is regulated
throughout the cell cycle are consistent with restriction
of Erk1/2 signaling during mitosis. In addition, knockdown of PTPN13 in prostate cancer cell lines increases
G0/G1 phase cells and decreases S and G2/M phase cells
[19], also suggesting that PTPN13 activity modulates cell
cycle progression. With respect to chemotherapeutics, we
demonstrate that expression of EphrinB1 in the context of
compromised PTPN13 modulates the cellular response to
paclitaxel in vitro.
Finally, our finding that a cleaved, nonphosphorylated fragment of EphrinB1 directly or
indirectly localizes to the spindle while its phosphorylated
forms are predominantly excluded from it suggest a
mechanism for PTPN13’s role in mitosis. For those tumors
compromised of PTPN13 expression and/or function,
taxane resistance may occur due to lack of EphrinB1
spindle binding. These data suggest that expression of
PTPN13 and/or phosphorylated EphrinB1 may function as
biomarkers for taxane response. Further studies will define
the mechanism of EphrinB1-mediated taxane response
and define its function in mitosis. This paper is the first
characterization of EphrinB1’s role in mitosis and effect
on taxane response.

Cell culture
HEK293, SCC1, 93-VU-147T-UP-C6, MCF7,
MDA-MB468 cells were maintained with Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MEERL cells
were maintained with E-medium (DMEM/Hams F12,
10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5
µg/ml hydrocortisone, 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 μg/ml
transferrin, 5 µg/ml insulin, 1.36 ng/ml tri-iodo-thyonine,
and 5 ng/ml EGF).

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded on 8 well chamber slides
(Millicell EZ slide, Millipore). At 80% confluence, cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (EMD Millipore),
permeabilized with 0.2% Tx-100 (Pierce), non-specific
binding blocked with Superblock blocking buffer (Pierce)
and incubated with antibody. Antibody binding was
detected with Alexa fluor conjugated secondary antibody
(Invitrogen), coverslips mounted with Vectashield plus
DaPi mounting medium (Vector Labs) and analyzed with
a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 1000).
For surface staining of EphrinB1, cells were again
seeded on 8 well chamber slides. When they reached 80%
confluence, slides were put on ice for 20 minutes to slow
membrane turnover. Cells were incubated with EphB1-Fc
(R&D Systems) which consists of the extracellular domain
of EphrinB1’s cognate receptor (EphB1) fused to human
IgG1; this generates a soluble reagent that binds surface
expressed EphrinB1. Following washes, cells were then
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and bound EphB1-Fc
detected with anti-human FITC (Sigma, #F9512).

Generation of EphrinB1 stable cell lines
MEERL cells were previously generated; briefly,
oropharyngeal cells from C57Bl/6 mice were isolated
and retrovirally transduced to stably express HPV16
E6, E7, Ras and luciferase. MEERL cells were seeded
at 40% confluence and mammalian expression plasmid
(pcDNA3.1 Zeocin, Addgene) containing either full-length

wildtype murine EphrinB1 or an EphrinB1 targeting
shRNA were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 lipid
transfection reagent as per manufacturer’s instructions
(Life Technologies). Following transfection, cells were
placed under antibiotic selection with up to 500ug/ml of
zeocin (Life Technologies). Untransfected cells died and
transfected cells were further ring cloned , expanded and
tested for EphrinB1 expression by IF and western blot
(examples in Figure 3). At least 40 independent clones for
each construct were tested.

in serum-free media to synchronize at G0. After 30h, cells
were released from quiescence by repletion of serum and
incubated 12h to allow entry into M phase. At this point,
one dish was subjected to 3 rounds of mitotic shake-off.
Cells removed by shake-off from both treatments were
pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000xg, 4°C, for 5m and
resuspended in 200µL lysis buffer (50mM Tris HCl pH
7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 2mN Na3VO4, 100mM
NaF, 10mM NaPPi, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100
) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 1X Halt
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo 28314 and 78429,
respectively). Remaining adherent cells were harvested
in lysis buffer, vortexed briefly, and incubated 5m on
ice. Insoluble materials were pelleted by centrifugation
at 16,000xg, 4°C, for 20m and the soluble (S) fractions
removed to pre-chilled tubes. Insoluble pellets were
then resuspended in 500µL lysis buffer and both these
insoluble (I) fractions, and the mitotic (M) fractions, were
sonicated on ice using one 15s burst at medium power.
All lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with
1µg anti-ephrinB1 antibody (R&D Systems, AF473),
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes
(Immobilon-P, Millipore) and analyzed by western blot
using antibodies against α/β tubulin (Cell Signaling
2148S), γ tubulin (Sigma T6557), and α tubulin (Thermo
62204).

MAP spin-down assay
In vitro microtubule binding of FLAG-tagged
EphrinB1 was assessed using the Microtubule Binding
Protein Spin-down Assay Kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Cat. #
BK029) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
for test protein derived from cell lysates. Briefly, ATCC
293T/17 cells were transfected with p3XFLAG-CMV7.1-EphrinB1∆ED construct using Lipofectamine 2000
Reagent (Life Technologies, Cat. # 11668). Cells were
harvested in 20 mM PIPES (pH 7.0), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
EGTA, 1 mM GTP, and 0.5 mM PMSF, supplemented with
1X Halt protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysis was achieved
by sonication at 4°C using three 15 second pulses at
medium power with 1 minute cool down periods between
bursts. For each condition, 400 µg of total protein was
immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C using ANTI-FLAG
M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. # A2220). Bound
protein was recovered via competitive elution with a 100
µL volume of 3X FLAG Peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #
F4799) at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. Eluted protein
was pre-cleared by centrifugation at 100,000xG, 4°C, for
20 minutes prior to binding assays. Microtubule assembly
and subsequent control and test protein assays were
performed according to the standard protocol, in which
samples with and without microtubules are floated on top
of a cushion buffer (80 mM PIPES pH 7.0, 1 mM MgCl2,
1 mM EGTA, 60% glycerol), centrifuged, and supernatant
and pellet fractions isolated and subjected to PAGE.
Coomassie blue staining was used for protein detection
in control samples. Controls included MAP2, a known
microtubule binding protein (positive control) and bovine
serum albumin (BSA, negative control) which has no MT
binding properties. Test samples (immune-purified FLAGEphrinB1∆ED, with and without MTs) were transferred
to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and
probed with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.
# F1804).

Immunohistochemistry
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumor
blocks were sectioned at 5 μm. The BenchMark® XT
automated slide staining system (Ventana Medical
Systems, Inc.) was used for the optimization and staining.
The Ventana iView DAB detection kit was used as the
chromogen and the slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin. Omission of the primary antibody served
as the negative control. In addition, the specificity of
antibody staining was verified using an EphrinB1 blocking
peptide (Santa Cruz sc-1011P) which eliminated all
sample staining.

Colony forming assay
Cells were seeded on 12-well tissue culture dishes
at 200 cells/well. On day 1 (day post-seeding), cells
were treated with 1, 10 or 50nM paclitaxel. Untreated
cells served as control. All conditions were performed in
quadruplicate. Cells were maintained for 5 days at which
point they were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with
coomasie blue and colonies counted using the GelCount
(Oxford Optronix, United Kingdom).

Immunoprecipitation of EphrinB1 and tubulin
Briefly, two 100mm dishes of SCC1 cells were
grown to 50% confluence in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS, at which point cells were washed and incubated

Five thousand cells/well were seeded on 16 well
Xcelligence E plates. Cells received either no treatment
(control) or were treated with 0.5nM, 5nM or 50nM
paclitaxel every 24 hours for three days. Conditions
were performed in quadruplicate and cellular impedance
monitored continuously for 6 days. The data are
represented as Cell Index (CI), a unitless value derived
from the relative change in electrical impedance over time
and is used as an indirect measure of cell number. A CI
value of zero indicates the absence of cells or their lack of
adherence to the electrode.
