Abstract
Aurora kinases play a critical role in regulating mitosis and
cell division, and their overexpression has been implicated in
the survival and proliferation of human cancer. In this study,
we report the in vitro and in vivo activities of AZD1152, a
compound that has selectivity for aurora B kinase, in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, primary AML samples, and
cord blood cells. AZD1152 exerted antiproliferative or
cytotoxic effects in all cell lines studied, inhibited the
phosphorylation of histone H3 (pHis H3) on Ser10 in a dosedependent manner, and resulted in cells with >4N DNA
content. THP-1 cells treated with AZD1152 accumulated in a
state of polyploidy and showed a senescent response to the
drug, in contrast to the apoptotic response seen in other cell
lines. Accordingly, AZD1152 profoundly affected the growth of
AML cell lines and primary AML in an in vivo xenotransplantation model. However, concentration-dependent effects on
cell growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were also
observed when human cord blood and primary lineage–
negative stem and progenitor cells were analyzed in vitro and
in vivo. These data suggest that the inhibition of aurora B
kinase may be a useful therapeutic strategy in the treatment of
AML and that further exploration of dosing and treatment
schedules is warranted in clinical trials. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The aurora kinases (Aur) have been implicated in the survival
and proliferation of both hematologic and solid malignancies (1, 2).
These proteins play a critical role in regulating mitosis and
cytokinesis, with the activity of both Aur-A and Aur-B peaking
during mitosis (1). The Aur genes map to chromosomal loci that
are frequently altered in human cancers (2), and the expression of
Aur-A and Aur-B is often increased in tumor cell lines and common
primary tumors. Aur-A and Aur-B have distinct subcellular
localization during mitosis, reflecting their different roles in the
process. Aur-A localizes to the centrosomes and mitotic spindle
apparatus and regulates spindle formation (3), although it can also

phosphorylate p53, facilitating Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination (1).
In contrast, Aur-B is a chromosomal passenger protein that
regulates chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (4). Several
aurora substrates have been described, including histone H3
phosphorylated at Ser10 (3). There is also a third aurora family
member (Aur-C), another chromosome passenger protein, which
has been implicated in the regulation of meiosis in testes (5).
The effects of inhibiting Aur-A and Aur-B activity have been
characterized in vitro. Suppression of Aur-A activity with the smallmolecule inhibitor MLN8054 leads to G2-M accumulation, spindle
defects, and antiproliferative effects in tumor cells (6). Targeting
Aur-B prevents chromosomal alignment and compromises spindle
checkpoint function, resulting in repeated rounds of DNA synthesis
without cytokinesis, thereby generating polyploid cells and
eventual loss of viability (7, 8). Interestingly, studies with mixed
Aur (A and B) inhibitors results in a phenotype indicative of Aur-B,
rather than Aur-A, inhibition (8, 9).
Aurora kinase expression in actively dividing cells makes them
attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer. A
number of small-molecule inhibitors of aurora kinases have been
developed and are currently in early clinical evaluation, including
AZD1152 (10). AZD1152 is rapidly converted into the active moiety,
AZD1152-hydroxyquinazoline-pyrazol-aniline (AZD1152-HQPA),
following parenteral administration in vivo. AZD1152-HQPA, a
reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor, is a highly potent and
selective inhibitor of Aur-B (K i 0.36 nmol/L) compared with AurA (K i 1369 nmol/L) and has a high specificity in a panel of 50
additional serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases (11, 12). AZD1152
has shown highly significant tumor growth inhibition in a diverse
panel of solid human cancer tumor xenograft models, including
lung and colorectal cancers (10).
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a relentless
accumulation of immature, abnormal hematopoietic cells in the
bone marrow and peripheral blood. It has been postulated that
AML is a disease maintained by leukemia stem cells. The
immunodeficient mouse xenotransplantation assay is currently
the model of choice to assay leukemia stem cells. This approach
has been crucial to the understanding of human AML by
providing reliable determination of the phenotypes of repopulating cells (13).
Despite the clear importance of the leukemia stem cells in the
genesis and perpetuation of leukemia, existing therapies largely
target the bulk leukemic blasts. Because the survival of only a small
number of leukemia stem cells may facilitate disease relapse, any
new treatment should be tested on the growth potential of these
rare cells.
In this study, we have used AZD1152-HQPA and AZD1152 to
evaluate the effects of inhibiting Aur-B in vitro and in vivo,

Effects of AZD1152 on Human Normal and Leukemic Cells

respectively, in AML cell lines, primary AML cells, and primary cord
blood stem/progenitor cells.

Materials and Methods
AZD1152. AZD1152 and the active moiety AZD1152-HQPA for in vitro
studies were provided by AstraZeneca.
AML cell lines and primary cell cultures. HL-60, MV411, THP-1, and
U937 AML cell lines were obtained from the Cancer Research UK Cell Bank.
These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2/95% air. Primary AML cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing
17% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37jC in 5% CO2/95% air. Leukemic blast cell count in the primary
sample before Histopaque separation was >80% for all samples.
Cord blood and primary AML cells. AML samples were collected from
St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and cord blood was collected from mothers
attending the Royal London Hospital (London, United Kingdom) after
informed consent and via a protocol approved by the local Research Ethics
Committees. Mononuclear cells were obtained by Ficoll-Paque density
centrifugation and ammonium chloride red cell lysis. Density-separated
cord blood mononuclear cells were depleted for lineage marker–positive
cells via the StemSep system (Stem Cell Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions to generate Lin cells.
Cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis assay. Cell number and
percentage viability were determined in 96-well plate format using the
Guava ViaCount assay on a Guava PCA-96 system (Guava Technologies,
Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Apoptotic cells were
quantified by Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D dual labeling using the
Guava Nexin assay.
Cell cycle distribution. Cells were collected by centrifugation; the pellet
was washed with HBSS, resuspended in 80% ethanol, and fixed overnight at
20jC. After fixation, cells were centrifuged to remove the ethanol, washed
twice with HBSS, and resuspended in staining solution containing 50 Ag/mL
propidium iodide and 50 Ag/mL RNase A in HBSS. The cellular DNA
content was then analyzed within 1 h on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson)
flow cytometer.
Senescence-associated B-galactosidase staining. Senescence-associated h-galactosidase activity was determined using the senescence cell
staining kit (Sigma). Briefly, cells were seeded in six-well plates followed by
72-h drug treatment and then cultured in the absence of the drug for 7 d.
Cells were washed in HBSS and fixed for 6 min at room temperature. After
fixing, cells were washed with HBSS and stained overnight at 37jC in the
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-h-D-galactopyranoside staining mixture. Cells
were then washed and observed under the microscope.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were collected by centrifugation; the
pellet was washed with HBSS, resuspended in 80% ethanol, and fixed
overnight at 20jC. After fixation, the cells were centrifuged to remove the
ethanol, permeabilized in a solution of 0.2% Tween 20, washed in a solution
containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide, and
incubated in 5 Ag/mL anti–phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) antibody (Upstate)
for 2 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody for 1 h in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed
and applied onto a microscope slide, air-dried, and counterstained with 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain. The percentage of cells positive for
pHis H3 was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and/or flow cytometry
using propidium iodide, pHis H3 dual labeling.
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared in Triton X-100 lysis
buffer and 20 Ag protein [determined using the Bradford reagent (SigmaAldrich Co.)] were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were then electroblotted
onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed for Dcr2, p15 (Upstate
Biotechnology), p16, and h-actin (Calbiochem). Protein bands were
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence visualization system
(ECL Plus, Amersham Life Sciences).
Cell line colony formation assay. Cells for colony-forming assay were
cultured in the presence of the drug for 72 h. Surviving cells were then
counted, washed, and resuspended in drug-free medium. Cells (2  104) in

www.aacrjournals.org

1.3% methylcellulose–based medium (R&D systems) were then plated onto
a 35-mm culture dish and incubated for 9 d at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. At the end of the incubation period, the
numbers of colonies formed were counted under the microscope.
Xenotransplantation assays. All animal experiments were done in
compliance with Home Office and institutional guidelines. Nonobese
diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice were originally obtained from Dr. Leonard Schultz (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar
Harbor, ME) and bred at Charles Rivers Laboratories. Mice ages 8 to 12 wk
were irradiated at 375 rad (137Cs source) up to 24 h before i.v. injection of
human cells.
For analysis, the femurs, tibias, and pelvises were dissected and flushed
with PBS. RBC were lysed using ammonium chloride. Cells were stained
with human specific FITC-conjugated anti-CD19, phycoerythrin (PE)conjugated anti-CD33, and PE-Cy5–conjugated anti-CD45 antibodies (all
from Pharmingen). Dead cells and debris were excluded via DAPI (Sigma)
staining. A BD LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used for analysis.
More than 100,000 DAPI negative events were collected.
AZD1152 was administered in vivo by the use of subcutaneous Alzet
osmotic pumps according to the manufacturer’s instructions (model
2001).5 Pumps were weighed at the end of AZD1152 treatment to confirm
delivery of the full dose. Treatment regimens are summarized in
Supplementary Fig. S3.
Murine cell phenotyping. Antibody labeling was done in PBS, 2% FCS,
10 mmol/L HEPES for 30 min with appropriate isotype-matched controls.
The following antibodies were used (all from Pharmingen): FITC-conjugated
anti–Thy-1, anti-CD31, and anti-CD34; PE-conjugated anti-CD2, anti-CD3,
anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD11b, anti-CD135, anti-B220, anti–Ter-119, anti–
GR-1, and anti-NK1.1; biotinylated anti–SCA-1; and allophycocyaninconjugated anti-CD117. The lineage cocktail used throughout contained
PE-conjugated anti-CD5, anti-CD11b, anti-B220, anti–Gr-1, and anti–Ter119 antibodies.
Primary cell progenitor assays. To assay human primary hematopoietic progenitors, Lin cells were resuspended in 300 AL of Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) and added to 2,700 AL of MethoCult H4434
(Stem Cell Technologies). Cultures were plated in duplicate. Plates were
incubated at 37jC, 5% C02 for 14 d and colonies were scored according to
standard criteria.
Delta assay. Lin cells (5  104) were seeded in 1 mL of IMDM-10% FCS
supplemented with cerebrospinal fluid, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, erythropoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Cells were incubated at
37jC in 5% CO2 for 1 wk. At the end of the first week, cells were enumerated
and subjected to methylcellulose progenitor assays (104/mL), propidium
iodide cell cycle analysis, and Annexin V analysis. Each week, 5  104 cells
were seeded back into the assay for regrowth in cytokine-supplemented
IMDM-10% FCS as before. At weeks 2 and 3 of the assay, 3  104 and 1  105
cells/mL, respectively, were plated in methylcellulose.
Annexin V labeling. Annexin V labeling was used to quantify the effects
of AZD1152 on apoptosis. One hundred microliters of 10 Annexin V
binding buffer (BD Pharmingen) were added to 900 AL of the resuspended
cells and mixed. Then, 5 AL of directly conjugated Annexin V Alexa Fluor
647 (Molecular Probes) were added to the cells before incubation at 37jC
for 15 min. DAPI was added to the cells, as above, before analysis on a BD
LSR-2 flow cytometer.
Statistics. Student’s paired t test was used to compare the effects of
different treatments.

Effects of AZD1152-HQPA in AML cell lines in vitro and on
the phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10. The cytotoxic and
antiproliferative effects of AZD1152-HQPA were evaluated in

treated with 0 to 1,000 nmol/L of AZD1152-HQPA for up to 96
hours. MV411 and THP-1 cells treated with 10 nmol/L show a
marked inhibition in proliferation, as did HL-60 and U937 cells but
to a lower extent (Fig. 1A). At 100 nmol/L, growth inhibition and
cytotoxicity were observed in all cell lines except THP-1. The
cytotoxic effect of AZD1152-HQPA was both concentration and
time dependent (Fig. 1B). In HL-60, MV411, and U937 cells, a 96hour exposure to 1 000 nmol/L resulted in an f80% loss of
viability. Although AZD1152-HQPA had an antiproliferative effect
in THP-1 cells, the effect of the drug on cell viability was minimal.
The inhibition of Aur-B activity was confirmed by a decrease in
the phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10. This was observed in

all cell lines studied, with complete inhibition of phosphorylation
at 100 nmol/L (Fig. 1C and D).
Cell cycle effects of AZD1152-HQPA on AML cells. The effect
of AZD1152-HQPA on cell cycle distribution was investigated in all
cell lines, with data shown for HL-60 and THP-1 cells (Fig. 2A). The
effects shown in HL-60 cells also reflect the observations made in
U937 and MV411 cells. AZD1152-HQPA induced polyploidy in all
AML cell lines studied. By 48 hours, cells had gone through a round
of DNA replication without cytokinesis, giving rise to a concentration-dependent increase in polyploid (z8N DNA content) cells
(Fig. 2A). By 96 hours, cells seemed to progress from polyploidy to
apoptosis, with a concentration-dependent increase in the

proportion of cells with <2N DNA content (data not shown) and an
increase in Annexin V staining (Fig. 2B).
AZD1152-HQPA also induced polyploidy in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2A).
However, more than 80% of the cells treated with 100 nmol/L
AZD1152-HQPA remained polyploid at 96 hours (data not shown),
with <5% apoptotic cells (Fig. 2B). Because THP1 cells showed such
a low apoptotic response to AZD1152, we investigated the effect of
aurora kinase inhibition on the ability of these cells to form
colonies. THP-1 cells treated with 100 and 1,000 nmol/L of
AZD1152-HQPA lost colony-forming capability (data not shown).
On further investigation, 80% and 95% of THP1 cells treated with
100 and 1,000 nmol/L of AZD1152, respectively, for 72 hours and
then cultured in drug-free medium for 7 days showed clear
senescence-associated h-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2C). No hgalactosidase activity was apparent in HL-60 cells. Senescence is

commonly associated with an increase in the cell cycle inhibitory
proteins p15 or p16, which was not seen for THP-1 cells treated
with AZD1152-HQPA (Fig. 2D). In contrast, a marked increase in
the senescence-associated tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) decoy receptor Dcr2 was observed,
whereas Dcr2 showed a marked decrease in HL-60 cells in which
AZD1152-HQPA induced apoptosis.
Effects of AZD1152-HQPA on AML primary cells in vitro.
The effects of AZD1152-HQPA on viable cell number, cell cycle
distribution, and pHis H3 staining were studied in 12 human
primary AML samples (see Supplementary Table S1 for clinical
parameters). After 96-hour exposure to 1,000 nmol/L AZD1152HQPA, viable cell number was reduced by a median of 34%
(range, 0–68%) relative to control (untreated cells). In most
samples, there was little effect on cell cycle distribution or the

cells to the indicated concentrations of AZD1152-HQPA for 48 h (A). HL-60 cells showed a marked increase in the apoptotic fraction after AZD1152-HQPA for
96 h, whereas little change was seen in THP-1 cells (B ). 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin D. AZD1152-HQPA–treated THP1 showed the enlarged flattened morphology of
senescent cells (C ), stained positive for senescence-associated h-galactosidase activity (C ), and showed an increase in the antiapoptotic TRAIL decoy receptor
DcR2 with 100 nmol/L AZD1152 (D ).

appearance of an apoptotic population (results from two primary
samples are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1). It was noticeable
that pHis H3 staining in untreated primary AML cells was low
(median, 1.5%; range, 0–4.4%) in comparison with AML cell lines,
suggesting a low proliferative rate. Based on this limitation, we
went on to examine the effect of AZD1152 using an in vivo
model of AML.
Effects of AZD1152 in vivo on mouse hematopoiesis.
Preliminary experiments were done to determine whether
AZD1152 was tolerated in NOD/SCID mice. There was no
significant negative effect on the weight of 12-week-old NOD/SCID
mice when AZD1152 was administered as an infusion for 2

consecutive weeks at 25 mg/kg/d. The mean (FSD) weight of mice
before drug delivery was 17.9 (F0.85) g (n = 5) and after treatment
was actually slightly higher at 19.5 (F1.9) g (n = 5). This suggests
that the overall health of NOD/SCID mice is not severely affected
by AZD1152 treatment.
AZD1152 treatment had a minimal effect on the absolute
numbers of CD45+ cells present in the marrows of NOD/SCID mice.
In mice that received PBS pumps, there was a mean (FSD) of 2.5 
107 F 0.9  107 CD45+ cells. One week of AZD1152 treatment at
25 mg/kg/d resulted in a reduction of absolute numbers of CD45+
cells to 1.7  107 F 0.3  107 (n = 6 for each group; P = 0.09;
Supplementary Fig. S2).

A comparison of the percentages of various subsets of CD45+
cells found no significant difference in the percentage of
lineage (Lin) /Sca-1+/c-kit+ stem/progenitor cells, B220+ B-cells,
CD2+ T cells, Gr-1+ cells, or CD11b+ cells between the treated
and untreated groups of mice (Supplementary Fig. S2; n = 6
for all).
When combined, this initial toxicity assessment indicates that
even in the presence of an apparent cytotoxic or cytostatic effect

on murine hematopoietic cells, there does not seem to be any
particular cell subset that is preferentially targeted, and the mice
tolerate the AZD1152 treatment.
AZD1152 rapidly and profoundly reduces an established
xenograft of HL-60 cells. To explore the effect of AZD1152 on the
growth of human AML cells in vivo, we first examined the growth
of the AML cell line HL-60. The HL-60 cells grow aggressively in the
NOD/SCID model.

As for all our in vivo experiments, we first established the
xenograft before treatment with AZD1152 and subsequent analysis
of the murine bone marrow for human cell content. Preliminary
experiments identified 5 weeks as the maximum time of HL-60
marrow engraftment from 106 injected log-phase cells without
serious adverse effects.
The results of 1 week of 25 mg/kg/d AZD1152 treatment on HL60 xenografts in vivo are summarized in Fig. 3A. The mean (FSD)
percentage of HL-60 engraftment in controls was 64.5% (F19.0%;
n = 11). After 1 week of 25 mg/kg/d AZD1152 treatment, the
percentage of HL-60 cells was 0.29% (F0.74%; n = 9). An example of
a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for the human
cell content is provided in Fig. 3B. A small group of mice were kept
for a further 2 weeks after AZD1152 treatment to see if the
xenograft would start to grow back. In all mice processed in this
fashion, the xenograft did not regrow (0.008 F 0.006; n = 3),
indicating that AZD1152 treatment effectively eradicated HL-60
engraftment (Fig. 3A).
AZD1152 rapidly and extensively reduces primary AML
xenografts in vivo. In an effort to mimic the presentation of
human AML, we injected 107 primary AML mononuclear cells and
allowed them to establish as xenografts for 10 weeks before
treatment with AZD1152 for 1 week and analysis for human cell
content at the 11-week time point.
Five primary human AML samples (patients’ details given in
Supplementary Table S1) were analyzed in this fashion. After
administration of 25 mg/kg/d of AZD1152 for 1 week, a rapid and
extensive reduction in the xenografts was observed in all the AML
samples analyzed. A summary of the human cell percentage human
cell content immediately after 1 week of 25 mg/kg/d of AZD1152 is
shown in Fig. 3C.
One cycle of AZD1152 treatment is sufficient to compromise
AML xenografts in vivo. The experiment that featured the largest
residual AML xenograft after AZD1152 treatment (AML-1) was
selected for further analysis, the results of which are summarized in
Fig. 3D.
Four weeks after the first cycle of AZD1152 treatment, the
xenograft had not grown back [2.9 F 3.8% after one pump (n = 12)
analyzed at 11 weeks versus 3.8 F 3.7% 4 weeks after first pump
(n = 9) at 15 weeks; P = 0.512]. Further treatment with a second
cycle of AZD1152 for 1 week at 14 weeks did not further reduce the
residual xenograft percentage (1.8 F 2.3%; P = 0.628). The cohort of
mice that were implanted with primary AML cells and then left
untreated for 14 weeks before analysis featured a large percentage

of human cells in their marrows (36.2 F 29.7%; n = 4). Treatment at
this 14-week time point with one cycle of AZD1152 for a period of
1 week reduced this xenograft percentage to levels similar to those
achieved with two rounds of AZD1152 treatment at weeks 11 and
14 (1.2 F 1.7%; n = 3).
Effects of AZD1152-HQPA on primary cord blood progenitor
cells in vitro. To explore the effect of AZD1152 treatment on the
growth of human normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we
performed an in vitro assessment with AZD1152-HQPA. Cord blood
Lin cells were treated with 10, 100, and 1,000 nmol/L AZD1152HQPA (results summarized in Fig. 4). A dose-dependent effect of
AZD1152-HQPA on the growth and differentiation of progenitor
cells was observed after a 2-week exposure. Control (PBSsupplemented) assays yielded 250 F 53 colonies/mL from 1,000
cells/mL (n = 4), which was reduced to 126 F 35 with 10 nmol/L
(n = 4) and 34 F 18 with 100 nmol/L (n = 4) of AZD1152-HQPA (P <
0.05; Fig. 4A). At 1,000 nmol/L AZD1152-HQPA, no colonies were
detected after 2 weeks.
In a similar pattern to the baseline methylcellulose assays, a
concentration-dependent effect of AZD1152-HQPA on the liquid
culture growth of normal hematopoietic cells was observed. At the
end of the first week, the mean total cell growth from 2 delta assays
done in triplicate was 2.6  106 F 5.4  105 cells per well for
controls, 1.8  106 F 5.7  104 for 10 nmol/L AZD1152-HQPA,
2.9  105 F 7.1  104 for 100 nmol/L AZD1152-HQPA, and below
the threshold of accurate counting (<104 cells) for 1,000 nmol/L
AZD1152-HQPA.
Surviving cells on day 7 were reseeded and cultured for an extra
4 weeks (not done for 1,000 nmol/L AZD1152-HQPA–treated cells
because cell number was too low). As summarized in Fig. 4B,
surviving cells continued to proliferate at a similar rate to
nontreated cells.
To examine progenitor cell output, cells from the liquid culture
were seeded into methylcellulose cultures at the end of each week.
The number of colonies per well was reduced by AZD1152-HQPA in
a concentration-dependent manner. The production of colonies
continued after AZD1152-HQPA removal, indicating the presence
of surviving progenitors at weeks 2 and 3 of the assay (Fig. 4C).
(Colony number reduces in all conditions with time as a result of
the proliferation/differentiation cocktail used in the liquid culture.).
At the end of the first week, cells were also harvested for analysis
of cell cycle distribution and percentage of apoptosis or necrosis. In
a similar pattern to the in vitro effect of AZD1152-HQPA on AML,
there was a concentration-dependent effect on the proportion of

on umbilical cord blood cells. One round of AZD1152
treatment at 25 mg/kg/d severely reduced the
level of human cord blood–derived xenografts. However,
when left after treatment for 5 more weeks before
analysis, the level of cord blood–derived graft was
slightly higher. Further treatment with another round of
1-wk AZD1152 treatment did not completely eradicate
the human grafts. *, P < 0.05.

Effects of AZD1152 on Human Normal and Leukemic Cells

cells that either were undergoing apoptosis (Annexin V+) or were
dead (Annexin V+, DAPI+). This cell death occurred concurrently
with a modest increase in the percentage of G2-M cells and
polyploid cells. Representative results of this analysis are provided
in Fig. 4D.
Activities of AZD1152-HQPA in primary cord blood stem
and progenitor cells in vivo. To explore a possible toxic affect of
AZD1152 on the growth of normal hematopoietic cells in vivo, we
examined its effects on xenografts derived from human cord blood
Lin cells. We established the xenograft before treatment with
AZD1152 and subsequent analysis. The first cycle of 1-week
treatment with AZD1152 was carried out 8 weeks after implantation. One cohort of mice was analyzed 4 weeks after this AZD1152
treatment to determine whether the cord blood xenograft could
recover from AZD1152 treatment. Another cohort was given an
additional cycle of AZD1152 treatment 4 weeks after the first
treatment. The results of this analysis are summarized in Fig. 5.
The level of engraftment after 9 weeks was significantly lower in
the mice that were given AZD1152 than in the control mice [9.8 F
6.6% (n = 4) for AZD1152-treated mice versus 62.5 F 13.9% (n = 5)
for control mice; P < 0.005]. Four weeks later, the percentage of
human cells was slightly higher in mice that had received one cycle
of AZD1152 at 9 weeks, but this did not reach statistical
significance [16.7 F 14.1% (n = 3) at 13 weeks versus 9.8 F 6.6%
(n = 4) at 9 weeks; P = 0.39]. A second cycle of AZD1152 treatment
reduced xenograft levels such that they were slightly lower levels
than after the first round of treatment, but this was not statistically
significant (7.9 F 6.4%; n = 3), indicating that residual cells might
be more resistant to a second cycle of AZD1152.

Discussion
The aurora kinases are emerging as potential therapeutic targets
in the treatment of cancer. Although several dual (Aur-A and AurB) inhibitors have been described, their effects may be more
dependent on the inhibition of Aur-B than that of Aur-A (3). We
have therefore investigated the activity of AZD1152, a selective
inhibitor of Aur-B, on AML both in vitro and in vivo.
In vitro AZD1152-HQPA was shown to effectively inhibit Aur-B
activity in AML cell lines and in some human primary leukemic
cells, as evidenced by complete inhibition of His H3 phosphorylation at submicromolar concentrations. In all AML cell lines
studied, AZD1152-HQPA also induced a marked antipropliferative
effect accompanied by the appearance of a polyploid population,
which in most cases led to apoptosis. Similar observations have
been reported recently with this compound by Yang and
colleagues (14). In THP-1 cells, AZD1152-HQPA had little effect
on viability or apoptosis but instead induced a senescent
phenotype. In THP-1 cells, a senescent response was also
induced by the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin, but not
by other antileukemic agents, suggesting a drug-specific response
(data not shown). This lack of apoptosis after exposure to
AZD1152-HQPA in THP-1 cells may be associated with a marked
increased expression of the senescence-associated TRAIL decoy
receptor Dcr2, which has previously been shown to reduce
sensitivity to cytotoxic agents (15).
In primary AML cells, the effect of AZD1152-HQPA was mainly
cytostatic, possibly due to the low proliferative rate of primary cells
ex vivo.
Cord blood Lin cells responded to AZD1152-HQPA in vitro in
a similar fashion to AML cell lines. There was a concentration-

dependent toxic effect on cell cycle and cell growth that
occurred alongside an increase in apoptosis and cell death.
However, once AZD1152-HQPA was removed from the culture
system, the surviving cord blood cells still had progenitor cell
activity as illustrated by the in vitro proliferation and
differentiation of lineage-restricted colony-forming cells. Unfortunately, due to the poor performance of primary AML cells
ex vivo, we could not perform the same comparison in AML
cells. Therefore, although it is encouraging that nonmalignant
progenitors seem to survive AZD1152 treatment, we cannot
conclude that there is a differential effect.
Once we had ascertained the effects of AZD1152-HQPA in vitro,
we progressed to analyze the effects of the prodrug AZD1152 on
the growth of the AML cell line HL-60, primary AML cells, and
primary cord blood Lin cells in the NOD/SCID xenotransplantation model. In all our in vivo assessments, we first established
xenografts before AZD1152 treatment and subsequent analysis.
This approach should be a superior test to experiments where the
xenograft and test drug are administered at the same time (16–18)
because it better reflects the clinical situation where patients
present with established leukemias.
AZD1152-HQPA had a profound, rapid, and prolonged effect on
the growth of HL-60 cells in vivo at the dose of 25 mg/kg/d. In all
five primary AML analyzed, 1 week of AZD1152 treatment led to an
extensive and rapid reduction of the xenograft content. Where
analyzed, AML xenografts did not regrow, suggesting that the SL-IC
activity within the graft had been compromised.
There were, however, small residual populations of primary
AML xenografts that persisted after AZD1152 treatment and
during a further round of AZD1152 treatment. Attempts at
secondary engraftment from these cells were unsuccessful (data
not shown), indicating that they may not be capable of
repropagating the disease. However, due to the high frequency
of false-negative results in secondary transplant experiments, we
cannot rule out the existence of residual functional leukemia
stem cell populations.
Ongoing studies of the pharmacokinetics of AZD1152 administration in mice have revealed that at steady-state conditions,
25 mg/kg/d of the prodrug AZD1152 results in a free, unbound
plasma concentration of f16.9 to 18.7 nmol/L. Hence, the dose
we used in vivo results in slightly higher plasma concentrations
than the 10 nmol/L AZD1152-HQPA concentration we used
in vitro.6
A 25 mg/kg/d dose in vivo and a 10 nmol/L concentration
in vitro were capable of inhibiting AML cell line and primary
human AML cell growth in vivo and in vitro. Although a larger
proportion of cord blood–derived cells survived the same dose of
AZD1152 treatment in vivo and in vitro, significant toxicity was
observed; xenografts did not regrow in 3 weeks after initial
treatment, and attempts at 6-week secondary engraftment were
unsuccessful (data not shown).
Attempts to obtain a clinically relevant therapeutic window with
AZD1152 may therefore be limited by hemotoxicity. Phase 1 clinical
trial data support this suggestion, as the dose-limiting toxicity is
reportedly neutropenia (19).
As a single agent, the effects of AZD1152 compare favorably
with those of cytotoxic agents that have been tested on primary

human AML cells grown as xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. For
example, the effect of cytosine arabinoside in NOD/SCID mice
on the growth of the same number of primary AML cells as
used in our own studies (107 cells) is reportedly to have a slight
but not statistically significant inhibitory effect on the engraftment after 4, 8, or 12 weeks of transplantation in NOD/SCID
mice (18).
The present study describes the use of an established xenograft
in the NOD/SCID model for the analysis of the efficacy of a novel
anticancer treatment. This approach represents an advance for the
preclinical development of novel anticancer treatments. A
xenotransplantation model that uses human cells is more
representative of the human disease than are alternative animal
models and can analyze a range of primary samples from patients
with differing outcomes at different stages of the disease. In
contrast, clinical trials early in the development of a novel
anticancer compound are usually limited to heavily pretreated
patients with a poor prognosis.

In summary, we describe the antiproliferative or cytotoxic effects
of AZD1152, and the data presented from these studies support the
further clinical evaluation of AZD1152 in the treatment of AML and
highlight the use of a valuable in vivo model for the preclinical
investigation of novel antileukemic agents.
