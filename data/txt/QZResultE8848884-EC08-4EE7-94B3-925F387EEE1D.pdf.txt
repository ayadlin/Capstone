ABSTRACT
Many breast cancer deaths result from tumors acquiring resistance to available
therapies. Thus, new therapeutic agents are needed for targeting drug-resistant
breast cancers. Drug-refractory breast cancers include HER2+ tumors that have
acquired resistance to HER2-targeted antibodies and kinase inhibitors, and “TripleNegative” Breast Cancers (TNBCs) that lack the therapeutic targets Estrogen
Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, and HER2. A significant fraction of TNBCs
overexpress the HER2 family member Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).
Thus agents that selectively kill EGFR+ and HER2+ tumors would provide new
options for breast cancer therapy. We previously identified a class of compounds
we termed Disulfide bond Disrupting Agents (DDAs) that selectively kill EGFR+
and HER2+ breast cancer cells in vitro and blocked the growth of HER2+ breast
tumors in an animal model. DDA-dependent cytotoxicity was found to correlate
with downregulation of HER1-3 and Akt dephosphorylation. Here we demonstrate
that DDAs activate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and that this plays a role
in their ability to kill EGFR+ and HER2+ cancer cells. The use of breast cancer
cell lines ectopically expressing EGFR or HER2 and pharmacological probes of UPR
revealed all three DDA responses: HER1-3 downregulation, Akt dephosphorylation,
and UPR activation, contribute to DDA-mediated cytotoxicity. Significantly,
EGFR overexpression potentiates each of these responses. Combination studies
with DDAs suggest that they may be complementary with EGFR/HER2-specific
receptor  tyrosine kinase inhibitors and mTORC1 inhibitors to overcome drug

resistance.

Progesterone Receptor (PR), and HER2 [28]. Subsets of
lung cancers and glioblastomas harbor activated point
mutants or splice variants of EGFR, but such alterations
are rare in breast cancer where EGFR is activated
primarily by overexpression of the wild type protein [28].
Thus agents that selectively block the folding of HER13 could have a major impact on the treatment of breast
cancer.
The molecular chaperone Hsp90 facilitates the
folding of a number of oncoproteins including HER2 [29,
30]. The Hsp90 inhibitor Geldanamycin and its analogs are
under investigation as anticancer agents [31]. Progress in
moving Geldanamycin analogs toward clinical application
has been slowed by problems relating to drug toxicity and
solubility [32]. We recently described a class of agents
termed Disulfide bond Disrupting Agents (DDAs) that
are capable of breaking disulfide bonds in solution, and
when applied to breast cancer cells downregulate HER
family members EGFR, HER2, and HER3 in parallel,
and inactivate Akt [33]. These agents have the potential
to ablate drug resistance by overcoming the functional
redundancy among HER1-3 and act downstream at the
level of Akt to abrogate drug resistance mediated through
upstream activation of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase
(PI3K). Here we show that in addition to these useful
properties, DDAs also activate the Unfolded Protein
Response (UPR). Importantly, DDA-induced UPR is
potentiated by overexpression of EGFR or HER2, providing
a partial explanation as to how DDAs can effectively kill
cancer cells without harming normal tissues. DDAs are
chemically and mechanistically distinct from other classes
of anticancer agents and selectively exacerbate the ER
stress caused by the aberrantly high expression of EGFR
and HER2 that occurs in breast cancers.

INTRODUCTION
The principle of “oncogene addiction” [1–3] posits
that particular cancers developed and continue to grow and
survive only by virtue of their initiating oncogene. This
principle has guided much of targeted cancer therapy and
has led to treatments for breast tumors that overexpress
the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2)
receptor tyrosine kinase. These drugs include the HER2
targeted monoclonal antibodies Trastuzumab [4–7] and
Pertuzumab [8–10] and the HER2/Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor (EGFR/HER1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Lapatinib [11–14]. HER2 targeted drugs have significantly
improved the survival of patients with HER2+ breast
tumors, but tumor resistance to these agents remains
a significant problem [15–18]. Thus, in addition to
monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
other therapeutic strategies are needed to effectively
treat patients whose tumors have acquired resistance to
HER2/EGFR targeted agents. A significant source of drug
resistance is the functional redundancy among EGFR,
HER2, and HER3, whereby inactivation of one family
member may be compensated for by another family
member [19–22]. Thus, drugs that act on features common
to HER1-3 could make a significant impact on tumors
driven by the HER2 or EGFR that have become refractory
to available targeted therapies.
Cancer is associated with dysregulation of protein
synthesis and protein folding, referred to as defective
proteostasis [23, 24]. HER2-positive breast cancers are
addicted to Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated protein
Destruction (ERAD) [25]. This may result from the
reliance of these cancers on HER-family proteins and the
fact that HER-family members EGFR, HER2, HER3, and
HER4 share conserved extracellular cysteine-rich repeats
that form numerous disulfide bonds that on overexpression
may present a burden to the protein folding machinery.
Compounds that disrupt the folding of HERfamily proteins may provide an effective means to target
cancers that are addicted to these receptors and could
complement other classes of HER2-specific agents.
Management of patients with HER2+ breast cancers
involves combining these HER2-targeted agents with
conventional chemotherapy drugs. Further, primary and
acquired resistance to HER2-specific therapy is a frequent
occurrence that leaves patients with few options. Hence
new agents that cooperate with existing HER2-specific
therapeutics could replace cytotoxic chemotherapy
drugs, and might be useful for overcoming resistance by
simultaneously downregulating HER1-3.
EGFR also contributes to the development and
progression of breast cancers [26, 27] and is overexpressed
in approximately 50% of the Triple-Negative Breast
Cancers (TNBCs) that lack Estrogen Receptor (ER),

RESULTS
DDAs induce ER stress
Since disulfide bond formation occurs in the
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), and HER2+ breast cancers
are particularly sensitive to DDAs [33] and ER stress/
ERAD [25], we examined whether DDAs (such as RBF3)
activate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). In the
DDA-sensitive MDA-MB-468, BT474, and SKBR3
lines, DDAs activated ER stress as indicated by GRP78
upregulation (Figure 1A). The DDA-resistant MDAMB-231 and HCC1954 lines exhibited high basal GRP78
expression, suggesting that they have adapted to persistent
ER stress. DDAs upregulated GRP78 at the lowest
concentrations tested, 2.5 μM, in the MDA-MB-468
line. Suppression of MDA-MB-468 cell proliferation
commenced between 0.8 and 4 μM, suggesting that
inhibition of cell division and activation of ER stress

occur over a similar concentration range (Figure 1B). The
ER stress response is mediated by the upstream sensors
PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. PERK-dependent activation of
an ATF4-CHOP transcriptional axis contributes to cell
death in response to un-resolvable ER stress [34, 35].
DDA-sensitive cell lines exhibited upregulation of ATF4
and CHOP in a concentration-dependent manner, while
the resistant cell lines expressed high basal ATF4 levels
and lacked CHOP expression (Figure 1C). Although
the IRE1-Jun kinase axis was previously implicated in
ER stress-mediated cell death [36], DDAs did not alter
activating Jun kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in any of
the cell lines. Comparison of RBF3 with the ER stress
inducers tunicamycin and thapsigargin showed that
RBF3 elicited ER stress comparably, but was more
effective in suppressing Akt phosphorylation (Figure
1D). The  observation that RBF3 upregulates XBP1s
demonstrates that RBF3 activates the arms of the ER
stress response involving the IRE1-XBP1s and PERKATF4-CHOP cassettes. Transcriptional reporter assays
in HEK293 cells were performed to evaluate whether
DDAs activate the third ER stress sensor, ATF6. RBF3
did not significantly stimulate basal ATF6-luciferase
activity, but potentiated the transcriptional activity of
ectopically expressed ATF6 (Figure 1E). Immunoblot
analysis of HEK293 cell extracts demonstrated that
overexpression of ATF6 increased endogenous GRP78
expression, but did not increase XBP1s, ATF4, or CHOP
levels. RBF3 combined with ATF6 overexpression
robustly upregulated GRP78 and increased XBP1s,
ATF4, and CHOP levels (Figure 1F). ATF6 activation
involves cleavage to release its cytoplasmic domain,
which travels to the nucleus to regulate transcription.
RBF3 increased the expression of exogenous ATF6, and
resulted in higher levels of the cleaved, transcriptionally
active form of ATF6. The results in Figure 1 show that
DDAs activate all three branches of UPR.

or HER3. Similar results were obtained after a 24 hour
treatment period (Figure 2B), although CHX blockade
of RBF3-induced PARP cleavage was less apparent, and
CHX partially restored HER2 expression in BT474 cells.
Results at shorter time points (2-16 hrs) showed that CHX
rapidly and persistently blocked RBF3-mediated UPR
(Figure 2C). A range of CHX concentrations were tested
for their ability to reverse DDA responses. The results
indicated that a complicated relationship exists between
RBF3 responses and inhibition of protein synthesis (Figure
2D). A likely explanation for this result is that on the one
hand UPR stress is associated with inhibition of protein
synthesis through the PERK-eIF2α branch, and would
suppress ER stress induced by misfolding of proteins
such as HER1-3, while on the other hand, resolution of
ER stress requires the synthesis of proteins including
ATF4, CHOP, and GRP78. Overall, the results in Figure
2A–2D indicate that blockade of protein synthesis with
CHX suppresses several DDA responses in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner.

EGFR or HER2 overexpression sensitizes cancer
cells to DDA actions
HER3 plays a major role in the survival of HER2+
breast cancers and their resistance to HER2-targeted
drugs [20, 21]. It was previously shown that breast cancer
cells engineered to overexpress EGFR are sensitized to
DDA-induced cell death and Akt dephosphorylation
[33], but differential sensitivity to DDA-mediated
HER3 downregulation was not examined in that report.
T47D cells engineered to overexpress EGFR or HER2
and treated with EGF, the DDA NSC624205, or EGF +
NSC624205 showed that EGFR or HER2 overexpression
decreased basal HER3 expression (Figure 2E). This
decreased baseline, combined with DDA treatment,
reduced HER3 expression to very low levels. EGFR
overexpression potentiated ER stress as measured by
XBP1s and GRP78 expression at an intermediate (18 hr)
time point (Figure 2F). Analysis after 15 hours showed
that RBF3 had largely downregulated HER2 and HER3
in the EGFR overexpressing cells at this time point,
while the levels of these proteins was unchanged in the
vector control cells (Figure 2G). The ATF4 and XBP1s
UPR markers were higher in the EGFR expressing line
compared to the control, while RBF3 induced GRP78
to similar levels in both lines at 15 hours post treatment.
Akt dephosphorylation was slightly enhanced in the
context of EGFR overexpression at this time point. The
differential effects of RBF3 on EGFR-overexpressing
versus control cells on HER2, HER3, and phospho-Akt
was amplified at 24 hours as compared with 15 and 18
hours. In contrast, at 24 hours after RBF3 treatment
XBP1s levels were higher in the control cells than the
EGFR overexpressing line. The ER stress response

Ongoing protein synthesis is required for DDA
induction of UPR
The sensitivity of HER2+ breast cancer cells to
ERAD inhibition depends on continued protein synthesis
[25]. The protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide
(CHX) and puromycin function by interfering with
the translocation step in protein synthesis and by
inducing premature chain termination during translation,
respectively. DDA activation of the ER stress response
was reduced if protein synthesis was inhibited using either
CHX or Puromycin over 8 hours (Figure 2A). Inhibition
of protein synthesis with CHX also partly overcame
PARP cleavage and Akt dephosphorylation, suggesting
that induction of ER stress may be partially responsible
for these DDA responses. In contrast, CHX did not
overcome DDA-mediated downregulation of EGFR

frequently peaks and then becomes weaker over time after
ER chaperones have been upregulated, protein synthesis
has been suppressed, and protein misfolding becomes
resolved. Thus, the differences between time points likely
results from the peak of the ER stress response occurring
earlier in the EGFR overexpressing cells as compared with
the control cells. HER4 was not expressed at detectable

levels in the MDA-MB-468 or BT474 cell lines, but HER4
was expressed in the T47D line. RBF3 induced HER4
downregulation at the 24 hour time point, but not at the
15 hour time point.

mediated through IP3 receptors. To evaluate the role
of this mechanism in RBF3 actions, we employed the
IP3R antagonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB).
2-APB reduced RBF3-mediated GRP78 upregulation, but
did not alter RBF3-induced downregulation of HER3, Akt
dephosphorylation, or PARP cleavage. Comparison of
RBF3 with thapsigargin, tunicamycin, or DTT treatment of
MDA-MB-468 cells revealed that RBF3 most effectively
upregulated GRP78 expression and IRE1-dependent XBP1
mRNA processing, while thapsigargin and tunicamycin
elevated ATF4 and CHOP expression more effectively
than RBF3 (Figure 3B). In this cell line, 2 mM DTT only
weakly activated the ER stress response as measured by
GRP78 upregulation. EGFR was downregulated by all of
the ER stressors. HER3 levels were particularly sensitive
to 20 μM RBF3 and less so to 2 mM DTT. Of all of the
ER stress inducers, only RBF3 induced significant PARP
cleavage, and RBF3 most strongly downregulated Akt
phosphorylation.
Although BT474 cells responded somewhat
differently to the ER stressors than the MDA-MB-468
cells, RBF3 and DTT increased XBP1s and GRP78
expression with little upregulation of ATF4 or CHOP
expression (Figure 3C). This is in contrast to thapsigargin
treatment, which strongly upregulated both ATF4 and
CHOP, and more strongly decreased PERK electrophoretic
mobility, consistent with its increased phosphorylation
[37]. Under these conditions, only RBF3 strongly
downregulated EGFR and HER2 expression, while both
RBF3 and DTT, but none of the other ER stressors,
decreased Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, the
results in Figure 3A–3C demonstrate that RBF3 produces
a pattern of ER stress response that is different from that
observed with 2-DOG, thapsigargin, and tunicamycin.
RBF3 responses were most similar to those seen with
DTT, although DTT was applied to the cells at a 100
times higher concentration than RBF3. RBF3 and DTT
decrease Akt phosphorylation in both cell lines. RBF3
reduces HER-family receptor expression in both cell
lines, while DTT only does so in the MDA-MB-468 line.
Thus, the DDA RBF3 is unique when compared to ER
stressors 2-DOG, thapsigargin, tunicamycin, and DTT
with respect to the spectrum of ER stress responses, Akt
dephosphorylation, HER-family receptor downregulation,
and cell death induction.
In contrast to the robust effects of RBF3 on the
EGFR+ or HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, RBF3 and DTT
did not induce an ER stress response in wild type Mouse
Embryo Fibroblasts (MEFs) and weakly suppressed Akt
phosphorylation and induced PARP cleavage (Figure 3D).
However, thapsigargin and tunicamycin induced a robust
UPR, markedly suppressed Akt phosphorylation, and
strongly upregulated PARP cleavage. In MEFs in which
eIF2α with the PERK phosphorylation site Ser51 mutated
to Ala was heterozygously knocked in [38], CHOP, ATF4,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and GRP78 upregulation by thapsigargin and tunicamycin
was significantly blunted. However, the S51A eIF2α
mutation did not affect thapsigargin- or tunicamycininduced PARP cleavage or XBP1s upregulation. MEFs
express very low levels of the HER-family receptors and
this may contribute to their relative resistance to thiolreactive agents such as RBF3 and DTT.

Cooperation between DDAs and receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors
Since DDAs and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
inhibitors such as EGFR-specific Gefitinib and EGFR/
HER2-specific Lapatinib block the functions of EGFR
and HER2 through distinct mechanisms, we examined
whether these two classes of agents cooperate to
inactivate mitogenic signaling pathways and activate
UPR. Co-treatment with either 2.5 μM Gefitinib or
Lapatinib lowered the concentration of RBF3 required
to downregulate HER3 levels and Akt phosphorylation
(Figure 4A). Under these conditions, the combination
treatments did not alter UPR as measured by GRP78,
XBP1s, or ATF4 expression, but Gefitinib, and to a lesser
extent Lapatinib, cooperated with RBF3 to upregulate
CHOP expression.
The MDA-MB-468 and BT474 cell lines are well
characterized models for EGFR and HER2 overexpressing
breast cancer, but form highly homogenous tumors with
questionable relevance to human breast cancer. PatientDerived Xenograft (PDX) models are the system of
choice for studying the effectiveness of anticancer agents
against human breast cancers (reviewed in [39]), but the
cellular heterogeneity responsible for their higher clinical
relevance renders studies of the mechanisms of drug
action on cancer cells difficult. To bridge this gap, we
isolated a cell line from the previously described HCI-012
HER2+ and ER-, PR- PDX line [40] using Conditional
Cell Reprogramming (CCR) [41, 42]. The HCI-012 cell
line formed tumors when injected into the mammary
fat pads of immunocompromised NOD-SCID-γ (NSG)
mice at 100% efficiency (n = 5/5), and the heterogeneous
morphology of the resulting tumors was similar to that
of the parental xenograft line (Supplementary Figure
3A). The HCI-012 cells rapidly initiate cell death if not
cultured in the CCR medium (Supplementary Figure
3B), consistent with previous reports that the CCR
approach maintains reversible immortality of epitheliaderived cell lines in vitro [42]. RBF3 treatment of HCI012 cells induced cell death (Figure 4B), which was
associated with upregulation of ER stress markers,
reduced Akt phosphorylation, but RBF3 had no effect
on Erk phosphorylation (Figure 4C). Lapatinib partially
reduced Akt phosphorylation, and strongly suppressed
ERK phosphorylation, but did not alter EGFR, HER2,
or HER3 levels, nor did it alter the expression of ER

stress markers. The combination of RBF3 and Lapatinib
suppressed EGFR and HER2 expression and completely
abrogated both Akt and Erk phosphorylation. This result
suggests that these two agents are complementary in their
effects on mitogenic/survival signaling. In the HCI-012
cells, Lapatinib did not influence RBF3 upregulation of

side effect. To address this point, angiosarcoma cells from
a TSC2 knockout mouse (TSC2-Ang1; ATCC CRL2620) were used as a model system. Treatment of these
cells with RBF3 had little effect on ER stress markers,
which were high under control conditions (Figure 4H).
Rapamycin strongly increased Akt phosphorylation and
co-administration of RBF3 reduced Akt phosphorylation
to basal levels. TSC2-Ang1 cell death was only observed
upon treatment with RBF3 or RBF3 + Rapamycin (black
arrows), whereas vehicle and rapamycin treated cells
continued to proliferate (white arrows) (Figure 4I). The
combination of RBF3 and rapamycin more effectively
suppressed S6 phosphorylation than rapamycin alone.
The results in Figure 4 suggest that DDA combinations
with RTK inhibitors might provide improved anticancer
actions. Pairing DDAs with rapalogs may both increase
mTORC1 inhibition and prevent off-target Akt activation.

DDA impacts pathways that mediate resistance
to HER2- and mTORC1-targeted therapeutics
The HCC1954 cell line is a model of Trastuzumab
resistant,
HER2-positive
breast
cancer,
and
resistance is thought to be mediated by the activating
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mutation H1047R
[43]. Observation of cultures revealed that combining
RBF3 and Lapatinib resulted in the highest level of cell
death (Figure 4D). Under these conditions, RBF3 and
Lapatinib cooperated to downregulate EGFR and HER2,
to increase fractional PARP cleavage, and to suppress
Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4E). The mTORC1 inhibitor
rapamycin did not cooperate with RBF3 to produce
these effects and antagonized RBF3-mediated Akt
dephosphorylation. Lapatinib only weakly potentiated
RBF3-induced UPR with respect to GRP78, XBP1s, or
ATF4 levels, but cooperated with RBF3 to upregulate
CHOP expression. RBF3 + Lapatinib was more effective
in reducing HCC1954 cell viability than either of the
compounds applied individually (Figure 4F).
Previous studies demonstrated that in contrast to
EGFR or HER2 overexpressing breast cancer lines, the
BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cell line is refractory to DDAs
[33]. Challenging BxPC3 cells with RBF3 indicated that
it reduced HER2 expression, but had little effect on the
levels or phosphorylation states of the other proteins
examined (Figure 4G). Lapatinib had no significant effect
on HER1-3 expression, or Akt or Erk phosphorylation.
However, RBF3 + Lapatinib not only downregulated
HER2, but also strongly downregulated HER3, and
suppressed both Akt and Erk phosphorylation.
mTORC1 inhibitors such as the rapamycin analogs
(rapalogs) inadvertently activate the PI3K/Akt axis by
removing negative feedback mediated through S6K1 [44,
45]. Since Akt activation might detract from the clinical
utility of rapalogs, which are used in immunosuppression,
the treatment of human cancers, and the management
of Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC) (Reviewed in [46]), the
reversal of rapamycin-mediated Akt activation by RBF3
was examined. In TSC, individuals have mutations
in the genes coding for the proteins TSC1 or TSC2
and develop benign tumors in multiple tissues in part
because the TSC1/TSC2 complex is a GTPase activating
protein for the Rheb GTPase responsible for mTORC1
activation (reviewed in [47]). Thus, mTORC1 activation
is characteristic of TSC. Rapalogs are FDA-approved for
TSC treatment, but activation of Akt could be a significant

Preparation and characterization of multivalent
DDAs
DDA RBF3 contains two repeats of the previously
defined pharmacophore [33]. New DDAs, termed BnDDA and PEMP-DDA, containing three and four copies
of the pharmacophore per molecule, respectively, were
synthesized to determine whether they have increased
potency over RBF3 (Figure 5A). Treatment of the
DDA sensitive EGFR+ MDA-MB-468 cell line with
increasing concentration of each compound indicated
that PEMP-DDA decreased Akt phosphorylation and
HER3 levels more than RBF3 or Bn-DDA (Figure 5B).
This immunoblot analysis was repeated a total of three
times and DDA-induced changes in EGFR, phosphoAkt[Thr308], PARP cleavage (cPARP), and GRP78 levels
were plotted in Figure 5C, 5D, 5E, and 5F, respectively.
The replicate immunoblot analyses are shown in
Supplementary Figure 1A-1D. Statistically significant
differences are indicated with P-values obtained using
Student's unpaired t-test. All bands were normalized to
the corresponding Actin loading control before the ratios
between drug treatments were calculated. MTT assays
with increasing concentrations of RBF3 and PEMP-DDA
showed that both reduced cell viability in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 5G).
DTDO is a cyclic form of the previously identified
DDA pharmacophore [33]. Since the two sulfur atoms
of DTDO are involved in DDA chemistry, we examined
whether derivatization of the second and third carbon
atoms of the four-carbon linker by either hydroxyl or
acetyl groups (Figure 5H) altered DDA actions on cells.
DTDO (20 μM) reduced activating Akt phosphorylation,
upregulated markers of ER stress, and increased PARP
cleavage (Figure 5I). In contrast, the hydroxylated or
acetylated DTDO derivatives with either cis or trans
configurations had little or no effect on these endpoints
at 20 μM. This result suggests that the cyclic DDAs act

through similar mechanisms as the linear forms (e.g.,
RBF3).
Experiments similar to those carried out with
MDA-MB-468 cells in Figure 5 were carried out with
the HER2+, DDA-sensitive BT474 cell line in Figure
6. All three DDAs decreased EGFR, HER2, and HER3
expression, increased PARP cleavage, reduced Akt
phosphorylation and upregulated the ER stress markers
GRP78 and XBP1s (Figure 6A). PEMP reduced HER2
expression (Figure 6B) and PARP cleavage (Figure

6C) significantly more than RBF3 at the same drug
concentrations. PEMP-DDA also reduced BT474 cell
viability more than RBF3 (Figure 6D).
The DDA responsive, HER2+ SKBR3 cell line
produced similar responses to bi-, tri-, and tetra-functional
DDAs as observed with the MDA-MB-468 and BT474
lines (Supplementary Figure 2A). As expected, the DDAresistant MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 exhibited ER
stress in control samples and did not exhibit a response

panel). MTT assays showed that RBF3 did not reduce the
viability of cardiomyocytes (Figure 7A, lower right panel).
The MCF10/DCIS cell line serves as a model of
Ductal Carcinoma in situ in which cancer cells aberrantly
proliferate, but are unable to invade through the basement
membrane to invade locally. MCF10/DCIS cells are
considered to express normal levels of EGFR and HER2
[50]. MCF10/DCIS cells treated for 24 hours with 20 μM
RBF3 did not die but continued to proliferate (Figure 7B).

DDAs are not toxic to cardiomyocytes or
MCF10/DCIS cells
Cardiotoxicity is a side effect of the HER2
specific monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab. Therefore
we examined whether RBF3 altered the behavior of
cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced
Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) as described previously
[48, 49]. Microscopic examination of cardiomyocytes
treated for 24 hours with RBF3 did not change their
appearance (Figure 7A, left panel) and their rate of beating
was not altered (Supplementary Videos, Supplementary
Video 1–Supplementary Video 3). Immunoblot analysis
demonstrated that the cardiomyocytes expressed HER2,
but RBF3 treatment did not decrease the levels or HER2
or suppress Akt phosphorylation (Figure 7A, upper right

DISCUSSION
Previous work showed that cancer cell death caused
by DDAs correlates with HER1-3 downregulation and
Akt dephosphorylation [33]. The results presented here
extend these findings by showing that DDAs also activate
UPR. We previously demonstrated the ability of DDAs to
break disulfide bonds in the model compound oxidized
Glutathione (GSSG) [33]. Disulfide bond formation

is a critical component of the folding of both integral
membrane and secreted proteins, and interference with
this process by treatment with reducing agents such as

dithiothreitol (DTT) activates UPR [51, 52]. The results in
Figure 1 demonstrate that DDAs activate all three branches
of the ER stress response. Interestingly, DDA RBF3

activates UPR at low micromolar concentrations, while
millimolar concentrations of DDT are required to induce
a similar level of ER stress. It is tempting to speculate that
this striking difference in potency relates to the structural
uniqueness of DDAs in having a nucleophilic sulfinate
group, an electrophilic disulfide group, and the ability of
the pharmacophore to interconvert between cyclic and
linear forms. Alternately, the bifunctional nature of DDAs
may render them more difficult for cells to neutralize than
DTT or similar reducing agents.
The observation that DDAs act through
mechanisms involving UPR, Akt inactivation, and
HER1-3 downregulation raises the question of which of
these pathways contributes to DDA anticancer actions,
and whether these responses are mechanistically related.
A comparison of RBF3 with other ER stress inducers and
the use of CHX to block protein synthesis and ER stress
provide some insight into these issues. Thapsigargin
upregulates ATF4, XBP1s, and CHOP expression more
strongly than RBF3 in MDA-MB-468 cells, while RBF3
more effectively suppresses Akt phosphorylation than
either tunicamycin or thapsigargin (Figure 1D). Like
20 μM RBF3, 2 mM DTT induces downregulation of
EGFR and HER3 and suppresses Akt phosphorylation,
but under these conditions only weakly induces PARP
cleavage and GRP78 expression, and does not upregulate
ATF4, CHOP, or XBP1s protein expression or XBP1
mRNA splicing (Figure 3B). Interestingly, 2-DOG
strongly induces ER stress in MDA-MB-468 and BT474
cells as measured by upregulation of GRP78 and ATF4,
but does not induce PARP cleavage, or suppress Akt
phosphorylation (Figure 3A). Further, 2-DOG does not
suppress HER3 expression in either the MDA-MB-468 or
BT474 cell lines. This suggests that reduction of HER1-3
receptor expression, suppression of Akt phosphorylation,
and increased PARP cleavage relate to the thiol reactivity
of RBF3 and DTT rather than to induction of UPR
alone. However, results obtained with protein synthesis
inhibitors show that while blockade of translation
overcomes the ability of RBF3 to activate UPR and
partially overcome PARP cleavage, this treatment did
not prevent RBF3-mediated downregulation of HER13 expression (Figure 2A–2D). Overall, the results of
these experiments obtained with the use of 2-DOG
and DTT suggest that the ability of RBF3 to induce
cancer cell death results from a combination of UPR
activation, HER1-3 downregulation, and decreased Akt
phosphorylation.
Ideally, cancer therapeutic agents should be
toxic to cancer cells with little or no impact on normal
cells. The principles of “oncogene addiction [1, 53]”
and “synthetic lethality [54, 55]” are strategies to
realize this ideal. These approaches are exemplified
by the use of BCR-Abl inhibitors for the treatment
of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), HER2-

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

directed monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase
inhibitors for the treatment of HER2+ breast tumors, and
PARP inhibitors for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutant
ovarian cancers. However, these approaches suffer
from cancer “escape” from therapy through a variety
of mechanisms. Thus, in many cases cancer cures may
require multiple drugs to overcome both the driver
oncogene and potential resistance mechanisms, or the
discovery of multifunctional anticancer drugs that target
the appropriate mechanisms.
Breast cancers devoid of Estrogen Receptor (ER-),
Progesterone Receptor (PR-), and HER2 expression (HER2-)
are termed Triple-Negative Breast Cancers. Currently, no
targeted therapies for TNBCs exist. EGFR has been suggested
as a therapeutic target for TNBCs [56, 57] and it has been
estimated that up to 50% of TNBCs may overexpress EGFR
at the protein level [28]. The potential for the use of DDAs
against TNBCs is supported by the observation that the
EGFR overexpressing MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell line is the
most sensitive line to DDAs identified to date.
DDAs are selectively cytotoxic to breast cancer
cells that overexpress either HER2 or EGFR and
EGFR overexpression potentiates DDA-induced Akt
dephosphorylation [33]. In the present study we examined
whether EGFR overexpression also potentiates other DDA
responses including HER3 downregulation and activation
of ER stress. HER3 mediates a number of resistance
mechanisms to HER2-targeted therapies through its ability
to be phosphorylated by EGFR, IGF-1R, and c-MET
[21, 58–61] and activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. In the
T47D ER+ breast cancer cell line ectopic expression of
either EGFR or HER2 rendered endogenous HER3 more
sensitive to downregulation by the DDA NSC624205
(Figure 2E), and EGFR overexpression sensitizes EGFR,
HER2, and HER3 to RBF3-mediated downregulation
(Figure 2G).
A concern with DDAs relates to their ability to
break disulfide bonds and potentially alter the function
of multiple secreted or membrane proteins. A number of
cell types that express normal levels of EGFR and HER2,
such as T47D, MCF10/DCIS, MEF lines are unaffected
by DDAs. However, T47D cells become responsive to the
toxic effects of DDAs upon overexpression of EGFR or
HER2 ([33] and herein (Figure 2E–2G).
Since a side effect of Trastuzumab is cardiotoxicity,
the possibility that DDAs might also be cardiotoxic is a
concern. The results presented in Figure 7 indicate that
while the cardiomyocytes expressed high levels of HER2,
there was no effect of RBF3 on HER2 levels in contrast
to what is observed in cancer cells. Further, RBF3 had
no effect on the beating of the cardiomyocytes in culture
(see videos Supplementary Video 1-Supplementary Video
3 in supplemental material). We speculate that the reason
that DDAs do not downregulate HER2 in cardiomyocytes
is that in these cells HER2 is expressed at normal levels

28983

Oncotarget

rather than being overexpressed. Therefore the addition
of DDAs does not cause sufficient ER stress to kill
cardiomyocytes. This is consistent with the observation
that nearly all breast cancers express HER2, but DDAs
are only toxic to the lines that exhibit dramatic HER2 or
EGFR overexpression.
Because of the large number of disulfide bonds
in the HER-family receptor cysteine-rich extracellular
domains and the ability of DDAs to break disulfide
bonds, we hypothesize that overexpression of HERfamily receptors such as EGFR selectively exacerbate

the ER stress induced by DDAs. Consistent with
this expectation, EGFR overexpression in T47D
cells potentiated RBF3-induced ER stress and this
effect was particularly notable at early time points.
We propose the model for DDA action in Figure 8A
where DDAs selectively induce the death of EGFR+
and HER2+ cancers through the suppression of Akt
phosphorylation, downregulation of HER1-3 expression,
and activation of UPR. DDA induction of UPR and Akt
dephosphorylation are potentiated by overexpression of
EGFR, or to a lesser extent, HER2. Due to their unique

Figure 8: Model for the anticancer actions of DDAs. (A) DDAs function to suppress tumor cell division and survival through

mechanisms involving suppression of Akt phosphorylation, downregulation of EGFR (HER1), HER2, and HER3, and activation of
UPR. Overexpression of EGFR or HER2 potentiates each of these mechanisms. (B) At normal expression levels, EGFR and HER2 are
folded efficiently and do not induce ER stress (upper panel). Overexpression of EGFR or HER2 cooperates with DDA treatment, which
blocks disulfide bond formation and protein folding, to activate UPR (lower panel). Red asterisks denote ER stress markers examined
experimentally in Figures 1-6.

and multifunctional mechanisms of action, DDAs may
be well suited for targeting the pathways responsible
for resistance to HER2- and EGFR-targeted agents
and prove to be complementary to other therapeutic
modalities including monoclonal antibodies and
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting HERfamily oncogenes. The high sensitivity of EGFR or
HER2 overexpressing cancer cells to DDAs may derive
from the large number of disulfide bonds in these
proteins combined with the ability of DDAs to prevent
the formation of Disulfide bonds in the ER (Figure 8B).
In addition to examining DDA effects on breast tumors
with overexpression of wild type EGFR or HER2, in
future studies it will be important to determine whether
mutants or splice variants of these proteins, such as
HER2-delta 16 [62–64] are responsive to DDAs.
Cyclic and linear forms of the DDA pharmacophore
can interconvert, and elicit similar cellular responses.
Slight structural modifications made to either form of
the DDA pharmacophore result in loss of biological
activity ([33] and Figure 5H, 5I), but increasing the
number of pharmacophores per molecule elevates
DDA potency (Figure 5A-5G and Figure 6A–6D).
This suggests a modular lead optimization approach
in which improvements are made to the activity of
the pharmacophore structure, and the optimized
pharmacophore is then appended to a polyvalent scaffold
to further increase DDA potency. These efforts are
currently ongoing in our laboratories.
