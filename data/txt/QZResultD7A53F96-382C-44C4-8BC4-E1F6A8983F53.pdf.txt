Abstract
Distant relapse after chemotherapy is an important clinical issue for treating
breast cancer patients and results from the development of cancer stem-like cells
(CSCs) during chemotherapy. Here we report that blocking epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) suppresses paclitaxel-induced CSCs properties by using a MDA-MB231-xenografted mice model (in vivo), and breast cancer cell lines (in vitro). Paclitaxel,
one of the cytotoxic taxane-drugs such as docetaxel, increases mesenchymal markers
(Vimentin and Fibronectin) and decreases an epithelial marker (Zo-1). Blocking
TGF-β signaling with the TGF-β type I receptor kinase (ALK5) inhibitor, EW-7197,
suppresses paclitaxel-induced EMT and CSC properties such as mammosphere-forming
efficiency (MSFE), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, CD44+/CD24- ratio,
and pluripotency regulators (Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, Myc, and Sox2). The combinatorial
treatment of EW-7197 improves the therapeutic effect of paclitaxel by decreasing
the lung metastasis and increasing the survival time in vivo. We confirmed that Snail
is increased by paclitaxel-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
EW-7197 suppresses the paclitaxel-induced Snail and EMT by attenuating paclitaxelinduced intracellular ROS. Knock-down of SNAI1 suppresses paclitaxel-induced EMT
and CSC properties. These data together suggest that blocking the Snail-induced EMT
with the ALK5 inhibitor attenuates metastasis after paclitaxel-therapy and that this
combinatorial approach could prove useful in treating breast cancer.

Introduction

understand the mechanism of the metastatic relapse after
chemotherapy.
The acquisition of metastatic potential during breast
carcinogenesis and during chemotherapy is in part due to
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During
EMT, cancer cells go through the morphologic and
phenotypic changes; increase in motility, dissemination,
and dedifferentiation according to the signaling
pathways that reprogram the gene expressions. Even

Breast cancer is a major health threat to women
worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related death in
women [1-3]. Although progression of therapies and early
detection technologies has helped the survival of cancer
patients, mortality is still high due to cancer recurrence
and drug resistance [4]. Since metastatic relapse is the
major cause of death in cancer patients, it is important to

though EMT participates in diverse biological processes
(embryogenesis (type 1), wound healing (type 2), and
cancer metastasis (type 3)), some of the underlying genetic
and molecular mechanisms may be related if not identical
[5, 6]. The majority of signaling pathways and various
transcription factors, such as the Snail family, Twist, Zeb
respond to these signals and function as master controllers
of the EMT program [7]. Transforming growth factor
(TGF-β) signaling is thought to be the chief inducer of
EMT as it plays dual roles in tumorigenesis [8, 9]. Indeed,
TGF-β acts as tumor suppressor during the early stage
of tumorigenesis, but ultimately promotes [5, 10]. These
actions are mediated by canonical TGF-β pathwas that
include ALK-5 phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3)
[11, 12].
The TGF-β signaling pathway during EMT also
involves the complex formation of Snail with Smad3/
Smad4 [13] as well as the regulation of the EMT master
regulators, Slug, and Twist [14], which accelerate cancer
metastasis [15]. Moreover, ectopic expression of Snail or
Twist or exposure to TGF-β induces EMT in immortalized
human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE) and increases
the formation of tumor spheres and CD44+/ CD24- cells,
also known as cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) [16, 17].
The subset of tumor cell population have CSC properties,
such as slow replication and cancer drug resistance,
providing an explanation to the development of tumor
recurrence and drug resistance [18, 19]. CSCs are capable
of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation as key
tumor-initiating cells and more resistant to anti-cancer
therapies such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and
radiotherapy than the majority of more differentiated
cancer cells, showing correlation with the poor prognosis
in cancer patients [20-25]. These studies together suggest
a direct link between EMT and the achievement of CSC
properties, which may be required for metastasis following
chemotherapy. Furthermore, TGF-β signaling is increased
in chemo-resistant cancer [26-30] and it is a major driving
force behind breast cancer EMT, development of CSCs
and metastasis [21]. In this study, we demonstrate that
blocking Snail-induced EMT with a TGF-β inhibitor,
EW-7197, can inhibit CSC development and that the
combinatorial use of EW-7197 with paclitaxel is a superior
strategy for preventing metastasis.

treatment, patients were divided into two responder groups
according to pathologic response (pathologic complete
response or residual cancer burden). In Figure 1A, the
Kaplan-Meier plot for distant relapse-free survival shows
that taxane-resistant cancers were more likely to relapse
in distant regions, even though they had been removed by
surgical operation. The result signifies that it is important
to prevent the metastatic relapse of taxane-resistant
cancers to accomplish valid remedy in breast cancer
patients. Since EMT is known to be closely related to the
metastatic potential of breast cancer [31], we analyzed
the changes of EMT markers in breast cancers following
taxane treatment. In Figure 1B, the mRNA expression of
Vimentin (VIM), a mesenchymal marker, was continuously
increased following the treatment of docetaxel, but Zo-1
(TJP1), an epithelial marker, was decreased. We therefore
examined if paclitaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 (MDAMB-231-P) cells also had higher levels of EMT markers.
As shown in Figure 1C, MDA-MB-231-P had an
IC50 of 16 nM for paclitaxel, whereas MDA-MB-231
had an IC50 of 3 nM. MDA-MB-231-P cells are resistant
to cytotoxic effect of 3 nM paclitaxel based on cell
viability assays (Figure 1C) and cell cycle analysis
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Moreover, the morphology
of MDA-MB-231-P cells had changed into a more spindle
shape. In accordance with the morphological changes,
the expression of the mesenchymal proteins, Vimentin
and Fibronectin, showed 2.5-fold and 1.5-fold increases,
respectively, whereas the expression of the epithelial
protein, Zo-1, showed a 0.3-fold decrease in MDA-MB231-P cells when compared to those of MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 1D). We compared the motility of the MDAMB-231-P cells with that of the MDA-MB-231 cells
using wound healing assays (Figure 1E). The percentage
of wound closure was significantly increased in the
MDA-MB-231-P cells by 4.6 fold compared to that of
MDA-MB-231 cells showing the similar growth rate as
that of the parental MDA-MB-231 cells in paclitaxelfree media (Supplementary Figure 1B). These results
suggest that the mesenchymal traits are correlated with
taxane-resistance in patients as well as in cells in vitro.
We subsequently examined whether TGF-β, a major driver
of EMT, is related to taxane-resistance in breast cancer
patients. Figure 1F showed that the expression of TGF-β1
and TGF-β3 ligands were significantly higher in taxaneresistant patients than those of responsive patients. These
data suggest that taxane-resistant cancer is associated with
mesenchymal-traits and that TGF-β ligands are increased
in taxane-resistant patients.

TGF-β inhibitor suppresses the paclitaxel-induced
mesenchymal traits in MDA-MB-231-xenografted
mice

in breast cancer by enhancing mesenchymal traits in
vivo, and EW-7197 inhibits the post-therapy-increase of
metastatic potential by attenuating the paclitaxel-induced
enhancement of mesenchymal traits.

We established the MDA-MB-231-xenograft NOD.
CB17-Prkdcscid (NOD) mouse model to examine if a
TGF-β inhibitor would inhibit paclitaxel-induced EMT
(Figure 2A). The mRNA expression level of TGFB1 was
increased by paclitaxel in vivo as previously reported [30]
(Supplementary Figure 2A). The treatment of paclitaxel
reduced the cancer burden starting from the 2nd week
(after 2 cycles of paclitaxel) until the 5th week (Figure
2B and Supplementary Figure 2B). During this period,
the TGF-β inhibitor, EW-7197 could not reduce primary
cancer burden in alone treatment and the combinatorial
EW-7197 treatment could not enhance the cytotoxic
effect of paclitaxel (Figure 2B). Notably, EW-7197
synergistically prolonged the survival time (Figure 2C).
As paclitaxel reduced the burden of the primary tumor,
it dramatically prolonged the median-survival time to 66
days, whereas that of the control group was 33.5 days.
However, the survival of the paclitaxel-group decreased
rapidly once the first death started. Even though the effect
of treatment with EW-7197 alone on survival was minimal
(the median survival time = 36 days), the combinatorial
treatment of EW-7197 with paclitaxel extended the
survival time over that of paclitaxel alone (Figure 2C).
We then examined the effect of EW-7197 on
metastasis as EW-7197 improved the survival time
without affecting the size of tumor burden. MDAMB-231 cells metastasized to the lungs of mice, as
identified by H&E staining and expression of the human
GAPDH gene (Figure 2D). We confirmed the species
specificity of primer sets used in this RT-PCR experiment
(Supplementary Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2D,
paclitaxel did not have a statistically significant effect on
lung metastasis when compared to the control group, even
though paclitaxel reduced the cancer burden efficiently.
Notably, the combinatorial treatment of EW-7197 with
paclitaxel significantly decreased the lung metastasis
by 0.27-fold when compared to the paclitaxel, which
decreased the lung metastasis by 0.73-fold. Protein
analysis of the primary tumors of MDA-MB-231xenografted mice revealed that EW-7197 inhibited EMT in
paclitaxel-treated cancers (Figure 2E and Supplementary
Figure 2D). The protein expression levels of Vimentin and
Fibronectin, two mesenchymal markers, were increased
by 3.86- and 1.74-fold, respectively, in paclitaxel-treated
primary tumors. At the same time, the protein expression
of Zo-1, an epithelial marker, was decreased to 0.24fold. Combinatorial treatment of EW-7197 and paclitaxel
ameliorated the paclitaxel-induced increase of Vimentin
and Fibronectin and restored the paclitaxel-decreased
Zo-1 levels in vivo (Figure 2E). These results suggest that
pacliataxel treatment increases the metastatic potential

Paclitaxel induces mesenchymal traits via Snail

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To investigate the underlying mechanism of the
paclitaxel-induced mesenchymal traits, we tried to identify
the EMT-regulators that enhanced mesenchymal traits in
response to paclitaxel. To begin with, we confirmed that
paclitaxel-induced mesenchymal traits were correlated
with the increased TGF-β signaling by detecting the
phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (p-Smad2/3) in
vivo (primary tumors of paclitaxel-treated MDA-MB-231xenografted mice) and in vitro. In Supplementary Figure
3A, paclitaxel increased p-Smad2/3 and combinatorial
treatment of EW-7197 decreased p-Smad2/3 both in vivo
and in vitro (MDA-MB-231 cells). Then, we compared the
mRNA levels of several TGF-β-related EMT-regulators
including SNAI1, SNAI2, HMGA2, FOSL1, SP1, ZEB1,
ZEB2 (SIP1), and TWIST1 [8, 32, 33] in primary tumor
tissues of MDA-MB-231-xenografted mice. Although
expression of many EMT-regulators appeared to increase
with paclitaxel, only changes in SNAI1 were statistically
significant (Figure 3A). This result was confirmed by
Wes analysis of primary tumor tissues in MDA-MB-231xenografted mice. Paclitaxel increased Snail protein levels
by 3.95-fold, which subsequently decreased significantly
with the combinatorial treatment of EW-7197 (Figure 3B
and Supplementary Figure 3B). Furthermore, EW-7197
inhibited the paclitaxel-induced transcriptional activation
of SNAI1 (Figure 3B).
To clarify the effect of paclitaxel and EW-7197
on Snail, we conducted in vitro assays in various breast
cancer cell lines including luminal and basal types. Cells
were treated with IC50 concentrations of paclitaxel for 24
hours. The protein levels of Snail were analyzed by Wes
analysis (Supplementary Figure 3C and 3D). In luminal
breast cancer cell lines such as T47D and ZR75B cells,
paclitaxel slightly increased the expression of Snail by
1.3- and 1.5-fold, respectively. On the other hand, in basal
breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-468, Hs578T,
and MDA-MB-231 cells, paclitaxel increased Snail by
paclitaxel-induced increases of Snail were higher than
those of luminal breast cancer cells by 1.9-, 2.8-, and 3.9fold, respectively. Among tested breast cancer cell lines,
paclitaxel-induced increases of Snail were the highest
in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells, which are highly
invasive breast cancer cell lines, associated with cancer
stem-like features (CD44+/CD24-) [34-36]. Therefore, we
conducted the advanced in vitro experiments using both
MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cell lines. In accordance with
the in vivo results, the treatment with the IC50 concentration
of paclitaxel increased the expression of SNAI1, VIM
and FN1, and decreased TJP1 (Zo-1) expression, which

was abolished by the concomitant treatment of 100 nM
EW-7197 (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 3B).
Treatment with EW-7197 alone did not decrease the basal
level of SNAI1 expression in both cell lines. The effect
of paclitaxel on Snail was confirmed by knocking-down
SNAI1 with siRNAs in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T
cells. As shown in Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure
2C, siRNAs targeting SNAI1 (siSNAI1) suppressed the
effects of paclitaxel on Snail, Vimentin, Fibronectin, and
Zo-1 and siSNAI1 #2 appeared to be more effective than
siSNAI1 #1. Both siSNAI1 #1 and siSNAI1 #2 decreased
the basal expression of Snail in MDA-MB-231 as well
as in Hs578T cells. These results suggest that Snail
is the major EMT-regulator that confers cancer cells
mesenchymal traits in response to paclitaxel in vitro. We
also analyzed clinical data in order to look for the major
EMT-transcriptional factors which would drive metastasis
in taxane-resistant basal breast cancer patients (Booser
dataset from ‘R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization
Platform (http://r2.amc.nl) (Figure 3E). We compared the
expression of EMT-transcriptional factors between relapse
(n = 8) and non-relapse (n = 8) groups who had taxaneresistant basal breast cancer and discovered that only
expression levels of SNAI1 were significantly different.
More importantly, the higher expression of SNAI1 is
related to the distant metastatic relapse in patients who had
taxane-resistant breast cancer (Booser dataset from ‘R2:
Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform (http://
r2.amc.nl)’) (Figure 3F). Based on these experimental and
clinical data, it appears that Snail is an important EMTtranscriptional factor that drives the metastatic relapse
after taxane-therapy.

To investigate the effect of EW-7197 on paclitaxelinduced ROS, we conducted in vitro experiments. In
Figure 4D and 4E, intracellular ROS was increased
by 1.32- and 1.46-fold in paclitaxel-treated MDAMB-231 and Hs578T cells, respectively. An NADPH
oxidase (NOX) inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride
(DPI), and a ROS scavenger, CAT were used to clarify
the effect of paclitaxel-induced ROS on EMT. NOX is
responsible for paclitaxel-induced ROS production by
converting oxygen (O2) into superoxide (O2•-) and by
releasing superoxide outside cells. The relatively unstable
superoxide is subsequently dismutated into hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), which is membrane-permeable and can
increase intracellular ROS [37]. DPI, CAT, and EW-7197
reduced the paclitaxel-induced increases of intracellular
ROS in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells. EW-7197 also
inhibited paclitaxel-induced intracellular ROS in vitro,
in agreement with the in vivo study (Figure 4B, 4D and
4E). We next investigated the role of ROS on paclitaxelinduced Snail and mesenchymal markers and as shown
in Figure 4F, Paclitaxel increased Snail, Vimentin, and
Fibronectin, whereas it decreased Zo-1 in both cells.
Notably, EW-7197, DPI, and CAT, all of which decreased
paclitaxel-induced intracellular ROS, attenuated the
increase of Snail and at the same time ameliorated the upregulation of Vimentin and Fibronectin, and restored Zo-1
in both cell lines (Figure 4F). These results suggest that
the increased intracellular ROS mediates the paclitaxelinduced increase of Snail and mesenchymal traits and in
addition, that the inhibitory effect of EW-7197 on Snail is
related to reducing intracellular ROS, which is increased
by paclitaxel.

Snail

In order to gain the insight into the mechanism of
Snail-induction by paclitaxel and the inhibitory effect of
EW-7197, we visualized the localization of ROS stress
and Snail by measuring 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)
as a marker of ROS stress. The results showed the colocalization of Snail with 4-HNE in primary tumors of
paclitaxel-treated mice (Figure 4A). Moreover, western
blot analysis confirmed that paclitaxel increased the
4-HNE-modification of proteins, and that concomitant
treatment with EW-7197 aborted the increase of 4-HNE
(Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 4A). To investigate
the role of ROS on the expression of Snail, we conducted
an in vitro assay with MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells.
We treated glucose oxidase (GOX) to cells with and
without catalase (CAT), a ROS scavenger, and as shown
in Figure 4C, GOX increased the protein level of Snail
by 1.6- and 2.9-fold in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells,
respectively, while catalase ameliorated the GOX effects.
These data show that ROS stress can be an inducer of

There have been reports showing that EMT
generates cancer-stem like traits in breast epithelial cells
[16,17]. We investigated whether paclitaxel enhances
cancer stem-like properties inducing mesenchymal traits
in HMLE and HMLER cells. At first, we calculated the
IC50 values of paclitaxel in HMLE and HMLER cells by
cell viability assays (Supplementary Figure 5A and 5B).
We then treated both cell lines with the IC50 concentrations
of paclitaxel for 24 hours and investigated the changes of
morphology and EMT markers. In Figure 5A, HMLER
cells showed an elongated and disseminated morphology
than that of HMLE cells and the treatment of paclitaxel
changed the morphologies of both HMLE and HMLER
cells into a spindle shape in culture. Moreover, the
expression of Snail and Vimentin were higher in HMLER
than HMLE cells and paclitaxel increased Snail and
Vimentin in both cell types. The expression of Zo-1
was lower in HMLER than HMLE cells and paclitaxel

decreased Zo-1 in both. Although there was no significant
difference in Fibronectin expression between HMLE and
HMLER cells, paclitaxel slightly increased the expression
of Fibronectin in both cell lines. Furthermore, Paclitaxel
increased the sphere-forming ability in both HMLE and
HMLER cells along with the enhanced mesenchymal
markers (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 5C).
HMLE cells, which lack sphere-forming ability on
their own, could form spheres in ultra-low attachment
culture after exposure to paclitaxel, although the growth
of spheres did not reach a 50 μm cutoff. HMLER cells
expressing the mesenchymal markers could form a
number of spheres, and paclitaxel increased the sphere
forming ability. From these results, we concluded that
enhancement of mesenchymal traits was associated with
acquiring sphere-forming ability.
Because the sphere-forming ability of HMLE cells
was not sufficient for measuring sphere-forming efficiency,
we conducted siRNA experiments only in HMLER cells
to determine the role of Snail in paclitaxel-induced stemlike properties. In Figure 5B, knocking-down SNAI1
diminished the paclitaxel-induced increase of Snail,
Vimentin and Fibronectin and restored levels of Zo-1. In
accordance with these EMT markers, pluripotent stem cell
regulators including Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, Myc (c-Myc),
and Sox2, were increased by paclitaxel and SNAI1-knock
down aborted the increase of theses regulators (Figure
5B). In Figure 5C, paclitaxel-induced mesenchymal traits
and pluripotency regulators affected the self-renewal
function of cancer stem-like cells. Paclitaxel also increased
mammosphere-forming efficiency (MSFE) by 1.8-fold and
knock-down of SNAI1 attenuated the paclitaxel-induced
increase of MSFE. Furthermore, the activity of aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH), a marker of cancer stem-cells,
was increased by paclitaxel in HMLER cells by 1.27fold and this effect was lost with knock-down of SNAI1
(Figure 5D). These results suggest that paclitaxel-induced
mesenchymal traits enhance the stem-like properties and
are mediated at least in part by Snail.

7197 alone had no effect (Figure 6B). In accordance with
in vivo data, paclitaxel induced ALDH activity and the cotreatment of EW-7197 ameliorated the effect of paclitaxel
in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Supplementary
Figure 6A). Another marker of stem-like cancer cells,
CD44high/CD24low, was analyzed in both cells. The
cancer stem-like population was increased by paclitaxel
and co-treatment with EW-7197 abolished this effect
(Supplementary Figure 6B). We conducted a functional
assay of stem-like cells by measuring mammosphere
forming efficiency (MSFE). Paclitaxel increased MSFE
and the co-treatment of EW-7917 decreased the effect
of paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6C) and
Hs578T cells (Supplementary Figure 6C). To determine
whether these stem-like properties induced by paclitaxel
were mediated by Snail, we depleted SNAI1 using siRNA.
SNAI1-knocked down cells were treated with paclitaxel
with or without EW-7197 for 24 hours and ALDH activity
was then quantified. Paclitaxel increased ALDH activity
3.4-fold while conversely, this effect was interrupted
by SNAI1 depletion (Figure 6D). Furthermore, the
paclitaxel-induced increase of MSFE was also attenuated
by knocking-down SNAI1 (Figure 6E), which together
suggests that EW-7197 inhibits the cancer stem-like
properties that are induced by paclitaxel and mediated by
Snail.

EW-7197 inhibits the pluripotency regulators that
are induced by paclitaxel and Snail
We investigated the effect of EW-7197 on the
paclitaxel-induced pluripotency regulators that play a
critical role in self-renewal of cancer stem cells. To begin
with, we found that Klf4 was continuously increased
following docetaxel treatment in breast cancer patients
(Korde datasets from Oncomine) (Supplementary Figure
7A). In Figure 7A, based on immunohistochemistry
assay, Oct4 and Nanog were increased in paclitaxeltreated tumors of MDA-MB-231-xenografted mice, and
decreased by co-treatment with EW-7197. Furthermore,
according to qRT-PCR, the mRNA expressions of
POU5F1 (OCT4), NANOG, KLF4, MYC (c-MYC), and
SOX2 showed 2.29-, 2.74-, 2.60-, 2.64-, and 2.18-foldincreases, respectively, in paclitaxel-treated tumors of
MDA-MB-231-xenografted mice, and these changes were
abolished by the co-treatment with EW-7197 (Figure 7B).
In accordance with the in vivo data, similar phenomena
were reproduced in vitro using MDA-MB-231 cells. The
24-hour-treatment of paclitaxel increased the mRNA
expression of POU5F1 (OCT4), NANOG, KLF4, c-MYC,
and SOX2 by 3.00-, 10.22-, 3.55, 5.09, and 1.51-fold to
that of the control, respectively, whereas co-treatment with
EW-7197 decreased expression (Figure 7C). These results
suggest that EW-7197 inhibits paclitaxel-induced cancer
stem-like properties in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting

TGF-β inhibition reduces cancer stem-like
properties induced by paclitaxel and Snail
As Snail plays a key role in enhancing mesenchymal
traits and stem-like properties in response to paclitaxel, we
sought to confirm whether Snail was associated with stemlike properties by visualizing the localization of Snail
and ALDH1A1, the surface marker of cancer stem cells
in many types of cancer. Both were indeed co-localized
in primary tumors of MDA-MB-231-xenografted mice
(Figure 6A). We then analyzed the activity of ALDH in
primary tumors of MDA-MB-231-xenografted mice and
determined that paclitaxel significantly increased the
activity of ALDH by 2.81-fold, which was ameliorated
by combinatorial treatment with EW-7197, although EWwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The TGF-β inhibitor, EW-7197, reduces TGF-β-induced Snail and also inhibits the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are generated by
paclitaxel. ROS induces Snail driving EMT in breast cancer cells. The mesenchymal breast cancer cells show cancer stem-like cell (CSC)
properties and lead to distant metastasis in vivo. EW-7197 blocks a Snail induction by paclitaxel and reduces CSC properties showing
inhibitory effect on distant metastasis.

In this study, we showed that EMT is induced
by paclitaxel in primary tumors of MDA-MB-231xenografted mice and that co-treatment of EW-7197
efficiently blocked paclitaxel-induced EMT based on
the protein analysis (Figure 2E). Even though paclitaxel
directly induces EMT in cancer cells in vitro (Figure 3C),
we cannot rule out the possibility that stromal cells in
tumor microenvironment may contribute to the changes
of EMT markers in vivo [45].
We further demonstrate that Snail is the main EMTtranscriptional factor that mediates paclitaxel-induced
EMT and CSC properties. Interestingly, basal-type (triple
negative) breast cancer cell lines are more readily capable
of enhancing Snail expression in response to paclitaxel
(Supplementary Figure 3C). This result may be correlated
with the microarrays of 52 widely-used breast cancer
cell lines [36]. It shows that highly aggressive basal-type
breast cancer cell lines are characterized by both the high
expressions of mesenchymal markers including TGFB1
and the markers associated with cancer stem-like features
(CD44+/CD24-). It is quite important that paclitaxel
increases Snail in aggressive breast cancer cells because
the high expression of Snail indicates a poor prognosis in
breast cancer patients [46, 47].
ROS are conventionally thought to be cytotoxic
causing cell damage at high levels. Recently, ROS has
gained intensive interest as an EMT inducer playing as
second messengers in various signal transduction pathways
[48]. ROS mediates the TGF-β-induced activation of
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling,
which drives EMT [49, 50]. ROS also increased the Snail
expression in Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) dependent
manner in response to matrix metalloproteinase-3
(MMP-3) [51]. Paclitaxel increases ROS by increasing
NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity [52] and in this study,
we documented that paclitaxel-induced ROS increased
the Snail expression and drive EMT in breast cancer cells
(Figure 4). Interestingly, other microtubule-targeting
drugs (docetaxel, nocodazole, and vincristine), which
have been reported to increase ROS in cancer cells [52,
53], increased the intracellular ROS and EMT markers in
MDA-MB-231 cells (in vitro) (Supplementary Figure 8A
and 8B). EW-7197 reduces paclitaxel-induced ROS stress
in vivo reducing the paclitaxel-induced ROS generation in
vitro. We previously reported that EW-7197 inhibits NOX
families and further decrease ROS stress in pathological
conditions both in vivo and in vitro [54]. These studies
together suggest that the increased intracellular ROS
mediates the paclitaxel-induced up-regulation of Snail and
mesenchymal traits, indicating that the inhibitory effect of
EW-7197 on Snail-EMT may be related to reduction in
intracellular ROS.
We showed that inhibiting Snail via blocking
TGF-β signaling reduced the CSC properties induced by
paclitaxel in vivo and in vitro (Figures 6 and 7). These
results are agreement with previous reports showing that

the pluripotency regulators. In Figure 7D, paclitaxelinduced up-regualtion of the pluripotency regulators was
diminished with knocked-down of SNAI1. Paclitaxel
induced protein expression of Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, Myc
(c-Myc) and Sox2 by 2.2-, 3.2-, 1.8-, 2.3-, and 3.3-fold
to that of control in siCTRL treated cells and in addition,
Snail knock-down reduced the basal expression of Oct4,
Nanog, Klf4, Myc (c-Myc) and Sox2. Inhibiting Snail
expression also diminished paclitaxel-induced increases
in the pluripotency regulators. Based on these results, we
suggest that EW-7197 can inhibit the paclitaxel-induced
up-regulation of pluripotency regulators via Snail.

Discussion
A number of studies have also shown that
mesenchymal traits are enhanced during long-term
paclitaxel exposure in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer
cells [38-40]. Additionally, development of invasiveness
and resistance to doxorubicin or tamoxifen is acquired
by EMT process in MCF7cells [41, 42]. In accordance
with the previous studies, we show that MDA-MB-231
cells undergo EMT by paclitaxel in vitro (Figure 1) and
in vivo (Figure 2). Also, primary breast cancer tissues of
patients express EMT following administration of taxanes
and more vulnerable to metastatic relapse (Figure 1A
and 1B). Based on these results together, we investigated
the therapeutic effect of EMT inhibition to prevent the
metastatic relapse following chemotherapy.
Tumor microenvironment consists of various
cellular components such as immune cells, fibroblasts
and vascular cells, which all together can favor tumor’s
growth and metastatic progression by producing various
inflammatory cytokines including TGF-β, resulting in the
silence of anti-cancer immune responses [43]. Previously,
we reported that treatment of EW-7197 as a single agent
inhibits breast cancer metastasis by blocking EMT and
by increasing immune surveillance via cytotoxic T cells
(CTLs) in the immunocompetent syngeneic mouse
models such as 4T1-allografted mouse and mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV)/-cNeu mouse models
[44]. In the current study, combinatorial treatment of EW7197 efficiently inhibits lung metastasis which cannot
be blocked by paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231-xenografted
NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid mice. Since functional T cells and B
cells are absent in NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid mice, we could not
investigate the effects of paclitaxel and EW-7197 on CTLmediated immune surveillance in this model. For the same
reason, therapeutic effect of EW-7197-alone-treatment
was more potent in immunocompetent syngeneic mouse
models [44] than in an immunodeficient xenograft mouse
model of the current study. However, the existence of
functional B cells and T cells seems to be insignificant
for paclitaxel to stimulate TGF-β signaling in tumor
microenvironment, based on the results in Supplementary
Figures 2A and 3A.

paclitaxel-induced Snail expression is associated with
chemo- or radio-therapy resistance by enhancing CSCs
and distant metastasis [38, 40, 55, 56]. Knock-down of
Snail decreased the activity of ALDH and the expressions
of Sox2, Nanog, Oct4, pluripotency regulators, in
pancreatic cancer cells [57]. Notably, Klf4 showed
continuous increase according to paclitaxel administration
in breast cancer patients (Supplementary Figure 7A). Klf4
is required for maintaining stem-like properties and for
cell migration and invasion in breast cancer [58]. Snailinduced EMT is closely related to CSCs, hence targeting
Snail is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating
resistance acquired by EMT.

Establishment of paclitaxel-resistant MDAMB-231 cells

Materials and Methods

Paclitaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells were
established by sub-culturing the survived cells at 3 nM
of paclitaxel in paclitaxel in RPMI media (5% HI-FBS).
The cells became resistant to the growth inhibitory effect
of paclitaxel showing the similar growth rate as that of
the parental cells. We confirmed the acquired-resistance
to paclitaxel by cell cycle analysis using propidium Iodide
(PI) staining and IC50 concentrations were compared using
cell viability assays. The detailed cell cycle analysis and
cell viability assays are described in the Supplementary
Methods section.

Analysis and visualization of open source clinical
data
Breast cancer clinical data were obtained and
analyzed using the Booser dataset [59] from ‘R2:
Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform (http://
r2.amc.nl)’ and Korde dataset [60] from ‘Oncomine
(https://www.oncomine.org)’.

Line Bank (Seoul, Korea), and the immortalized human
breast epithelial cells (HMLE) and Ras-transformed
HMLE (HMLER) cells from Dr. Robert A. Weinberg
(Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, USA). No authentication of these cell
lines was performed by the authors, with the exception of
performing a mycoplasma test using the e-MycoTM plus
mycoplasma PCR detection kit (iNtRON Biotechnology,
Korea) once a year. All cells were maintained as described
previously [44]. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and
Hs578T cells were grown in RPMI (Gibco Laboratories,
Grand Island, NY) complemented with 5% HI-FBS.
ZR75B and T47D cells were grown in RPMI with
10% FBS. HMLE and HMLER cells were grown in
DMEM/F-12 (1:1) (Gendepot, CA, USA) complemented
with 10% HI-FBS, 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 0.5
μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma, St. Louis, MO ). For
measuring mammosphere-forming efficiency (MSFE),
cells were seeded in ultra-low attachment dishes for 4
days in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with B27, 20 ng/
ml FGF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 20 ng/ml
EGF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After five days, the number

for 18 hours (end point). Phase-contrast images of cells
were captured with a camera attached to a microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The wound area at
zero time or the end point was measured using the ImageJ
(NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The area of wound closure
was calculated as a percentage of the initial wound area.

Cells or tissues were homogenized in RIPA
buffer as described previously (24) and westerns were
performed using Wes automated western blotting
system (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. Lysates containing 200 ng/μl of
total protein were separated by electrophoresis in in nanocapillary gels. The primary antibodies used are listed in
Supplementary Table 2. Quantification of peak areas and
gel image reconstruction was performed using Compass

Conflicts of Interest

AldeflourTM kit (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver,
BC, Canada) was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, to analyze ALDH activity. Briefly, trypsinized
single cells were incubated with ALDH substrate, biodipyaminoacetaldehyde (BAAA), and after 30 minutes
incubation at 37 oC, they were washed and analyzed
using a BD FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience, San Diego,
CA, USA). An aliquot of each sample was incubated with
the ALDH inhibitor, N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB). For analyzing the CD24 and CD44 surface
marekrs, cells were co-stained with FITC-conjugated
anti-CD24 and PE-conjugated anti-CD44 antibodies (BD
Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), and non-stained cells
and single-stained cells were used as negative and positive
controls, respectively.
