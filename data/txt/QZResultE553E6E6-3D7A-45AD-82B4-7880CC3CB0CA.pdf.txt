ABSTRACT
Purpose: Gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare cancer with no clinical
standard treatment. With the rapid development of next generation sequencing, it
has been able to provide reasonable treatment options for patients based on genetic
variations. However, most cancer drugs are not approval for gallbladder sarcomatoid
carcinoma indications. The correlation between drug response and a genetic variation
needs to be further elucidated.
Experimental Design: Three patient-derived cells-JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002,
and JXQ-3D-003, were derived from biopsy samples of one gallbladder sarcomatoid
carcinoma patient with progression and have been characterized. In order to study
the relationship between drug sensitivity and gene alteration, genetic mutations of
three patient-derived cells were discovered by whole exome sequencing, and drug
screening has been performed based on the gene alterations and related signaling
pathways that are associated with drug targets.
Results: It has been found that there are differences in biological characteristics
such as morphology, cell proliferation, cell migration and colony formation activity
among these three patient-derived cells although they are derived from the same
patient. Their sensitivities to the chemotherapy drugs-Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin, and
Cisplatin are distinct. Moreover, none of common chemotherapy drugs could inhibit
the proliferations of all three patient-derived cells. Comprehensive analysis of their
whole exome sequencing demonstrated that tumor-associated genes TP53, AKT2,
FGFR3, FGF10, SDHA, and PI3KCA were mutated or amplified. Part of these alterations
are actionable. By screening a set of compounds that are associated with the genetic
alteration, it has been found that GDC-0941 and PF-04691502 for PI3K-AKT-mTOR
pathway inhibitors could dramatically decrease the proliferation of three patientderived cells. Importantly, expression of phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated S6
were markedly decreased after treatments with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors
GDC-0941 (0.5 μM) and PF-04691502 (0.1 μM) in all three patient-derived cells.
These data suggested that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that was
activated by PIK3CA amplification in all three patient-derived cells could reduce the
cell proliferation.

Conclusions: A patient-derived cell model combined with whole exome sequencing
is a powerful tool to elucidate relationship between drug sensitivities and genetic
alternations. In these gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma patient-derived cells, it
is found that PIK3CA amplification could be used as a biomarker to indicate PI3KAKT-mTOR pathway activation. Block of the pathway may benefit the gallbladder
sarcomatoid carcinoma patient with this alternation in hypothesis. The real efficacy
needs to be confirmed in vivo or in a clinical trial.

treat non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), melanoma, and
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [30–34]. Nevertheless,
whether these TKIs can be used for GSC therapy remains
unclear. The relationship between the sensitivities of targeted
inhibitors and genetic variations in GBC needs to be further
elucidated.
In this study, three GSC PDCs that derived from
one single GSC patient were established. The biological
characteristics and the response to the chemotherapy drugs
have been explored. Furthermore, the genetic variations
of three GSC PDCs were discovered by WES and their
association with the sensitivities of targeted inhibitors has
been elucidated.

INTRODUCTION
Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most malignancy
in the biliary tract, and ranks fifth among gastrointestinal
tract malignancy [1–3]. Gallbladder adenocarcinoma is the
dominate type whereas gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma
(GSC) is rare with epithelial and mesenchymal components
[4]. To our best knowledge, only eighty cases of GSC have
been reported in literatures worldwide [5–10]. Despite
of advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy
in past several decades, GSC is still characterized of a
poor prognosis with no clinical standard treatment [11,
12]. Up to now, decisions on the elective and therapeutic
management of GSC patients are made mainly based on
clinical backgrounds, due to lack of targeted drugs approved
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or China
Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for GSC [13–15].
Therefore, new targets and methods to guide a rational use
of pharmaceuticals are needed for GSC treatment, which
could be beneficial for therapeutic management of GSC in
clinical application.
The PDC model provides a preclinical tool for
translational study with an obvious benefit of infinite
supply of a relatively homogeneous cell line that is capable
of self-replication [16]. Tumor PDCs established directly
from human tumor tissue can serve as an unique way to
study the molecular and cellular processes underlying
malignant disease and identify novel therapeutic targets
[17]. The PDCs have been used to discover drug targets
and explore drug resistance in a variety of tumors, such as
breast cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and
etc. [18–22]. However, the PDCs from GSC have not been
reported previously.
With the rapid development of the next generation
sequencing (NGS), tumor profiling has been widely used in
translational medicine research and clinical diagnosis [23–
26]. Maolan Li et al provided an insight into the somatic
mutational landscape in GBC and highlighted the key role
of the ErbB signaling pathway in GBC tumorigenesis using
WES [27]. Michele Simbolo et al found that KRAS and
TP53 mutations occurred more frequently in GBC than in
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICC). The molecular
subtypes of cholangiocarcinomas were identified and can
be explored for targeted drug efficacy in clinical trials [28].
Genotype-based selection of patients for the application
of targeted therapies has had a significant impact on the
treatment of cancers. Effective targeted therapies, such as
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [29], are widely used to

RESULTS
The GSC PDCs preserve some characteristics
of the GSC tissue and show heterogeneity inside
tumor
The clinical features of a GSC patient were shown
in Supplementary Table S1. This GSC patient had an
elevated CA19-9 with 95.0 U/mL and total bilirubin of
121.2 μmol/L, which are out of the normal ranges. The
Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopanc-reatography (MRCP)
and Computed Tomography (CT) on the gallbladder
sarcomatoid carcinoma (Supplementary Figure S1)
demonstrated interruption of extrahepatic bile duct
structure and gallbladder wall thickening, suggesting
that the patient might have malignant lesions. The
immunohistochemistry staining of the tumor specimens
showed pan-cytokeratin (pan-CK) (+), Ki67 (+), Heppar-1
(-), CAM5.2 (+), Vimetin (+), CK19 (-), and SMA (+)
(Supplementary Figure S2), which are associated with the
clinical characteristics of sarcoma patients [35–38].
Three GSC PDCs-JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002 and
JXQ-3D-003, were derived from one biopsy of the GSC
patient at different sites (Figure 1A). The Short Tandem
Repeat (STR) assay identified the karyotype of these PDCs
resembling para-carcinoma tissue (Supplementary Table
S2). The morphology of three GSC PDCs is different.
More biological characteristics of the PDCs including
cell proliferation, cell migration, and colony formation
activities have been studied (Figure 1B, 1C, 1D). The
differences among these PDCs indicated the existence
of distinct subclones in this gallbladder sarcomatoid
carcinoma tissue. Meanwhile, pan-cytokeratin (CK)
expression could be observed in all three GSC PDCs

drugs respectively for 10 days and their colonies were
evaluated. Fluorouracil and Doxorubicin, not Cisplatin
highly inhibit the colony formation of JXQ-3D-001,
while Fluorouracil and Cisplatin, not Doxorubicin inhibit
the colony formation of JXQ-3D-002. However, all three
drugs demonstrated inhibition of JXQ-3D-003 (Figure
2B). These results indicated that a single drug alone
could not completely inhibit the proliferation and colony
formation of three GSC PDCs from the same patient,
which demonstrates the heterogeneity of GSC tumor.

Diverse response of three GSC PDCs to
chemotherapy drugs for biliary tract cancer
Three GSC PDCs derived from one single GSC
patient can be used as an in vitro model to test the
effectiveness of chemo-drugs. In this study, Fluorouracil,
Doxorubicin and Cisplatin clinically used for GSC
treatment were tested in these GSC PDCs for cell
proliferation inhibition. All GSC PDCs are not sensitive
to Cisplatin with IC50 > 300 μM (Figure 2A). However,
Fluorouracil and Doxorubicin are both effective drugs
for three GSC PDCs, although IC50 of Doxorubicin
is significantly less than that of Fluorouracil (Figure
2A). Colony formation is a better tool to evaluate cell
proliferation. To test the effectiveness of chemotherapy
drugs on colony formation, Fluorouracil (5 μM),
Doxorubicin (0.1 μM) and Cisplatin (150 μM) were
applied to each PDC. JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002 and
JXQ-3D-003 cells were treated with three chemotherapy

The variant and CNV landscapes of three GSC
PDCs by WES
The variant landscapes of three GSC PDCs were
further explored to search for appropriate drug targets.
To discover the somatic mutations and CNVs for three
GSC PDCs, WES of PDCs and their matched blood
samples were performed. The mean coverage of three
GSC PDCs and blood (BLD) was more than 100 X
(Supplementary Table S3). All somatic variants are listed
in Supplementary Table S4. Variants from TP53, APC,
CDKN2A, PIK3C2B, ABL2, CDK6, and MAP3K12,
including missense mutation, inframe and truncation, are
highly similar across three PDCs (Figure 3A). These PDCs

also had similar copy number variation (CNV) patterns
(Figure 3B). The gene amplification and deep deletion is
listed in Supplementary Table S5. Some of these amplified
genes are well-known tumor related genes, such as AKT2,
FGFR3, FGF10, SDHA, CCNE1, PI3KCA, and etc (Figure
3C). AKT2, FGFR3, and FGF10 amplification had been
reported in Chinese gallbladder carcinoma [27]. PIK3CA
amplification was occasionally observed in breast cancer,
gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
[39–43]. CCNE1, SDHA, and AKT2 amplifications
occurred in only one of three GSC PDCs, while BCL6 and
PI3KCA amplifications were detected in all three GSC
PDCs. Part of the detected variants and amplifications are
actionable.

A set of 9 compounds associated with somatic
variants has been screened. IC50s are dramatically
different across a set of compounds in these PDCs
(Supplementary Table S6). Among these compounds,
GDC-0941 and PF-04691502, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
pathway inhibitors, can dramatically inhibit the cell
growth of all three GSC PDCs (Figure 4A). Importantly,
phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated S6 were
markedly decreased after treatment with GDC-0941 (0.5
μM) and PF-04691502 (0.1 μM) for six hours (Figure
4B). These results suggested that PIK3CA amplification

In conclusion, a tumor PDC model combined with
WES has been successfully used to study the relationship
between drug sensitivity and genetic variation in GSC.
Such a model has provided a foundation for GSC drug
target identification and validation. Drug screening in
PDCs could elucidate the relationship between a drug and
its corresponding target, which would guide a rational use

DISCUSSION
We have successfully established three GSC
PDCs from a single GSC patient. These PDCs showed
distinct biological characteristics such as morphology,
cell proliferation, cell migration and colony formation.
These GSC PDCs also exhibited different sensitivities
to the chemotherapy drugs, such as Fluorouracil,
Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin. These findings indicated
that these PDCs preserve intratumor heterogeneity that
has been discovered in other types of tumor [44–48]. In
addition, Pan-cytokeratin (CK) expression was detected
in all three GSC PDCs, which is concordant with the
CK immunohistochemistry staining result in patient
GSC tissue. Furthermore, three GSC PDCs remain the
molecular features of patient GSC tumor [49] and could
be used as in vitro model to study the biological features
of GSC, which have not been reported in previous studies.
By using WES, genetic mutations, such as TP53,
APC, CDKN2A that have been reported previously in GBC
[28, 50], were detected in three GSC PDCs. In addition,
some mutations that were found in other types of tumor
like CDK6, PIK3C2B, and ABL2 [51–54] also occurred
in our PDCs. Some of the amplified genes in either PDCs
are well-known tumor related genes, such as AKT2,
FGFR3, FGF10, SDHA, and PI3KCA. Interestingly, all
three GSC PDCs harbor PIK3CA amplification that has
also been reported in breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma,
and so on [39, 42, 43, 55, 56]. Previous studies indicated
that PIK3CA amplification might drive PI3K-AKTmTOR pathway. Our drug screening results in this study
supported this hypothesis.
In drug screening, it was found that JXQ-3D-003
with FGF10 and FGFR3 amplifications was not sensitive
to FGFR pathway inhibitors-AZD4547 and LY2874455
(Figure 3C and Supplementary Table S4). Francesco Iorio,
et al also found that the sensitivity of some compounds
was not always concordant with genetic variation [57].
Integration of somatic mutations, copy number alterations,
DNA methylation, and gene expression together might
be a better way to predict drug response. In this study,
although PI3KCA amplification might be used as a
biomarker to elucidate PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
activation, the response of PDCs to other compounds
might not be clearly explained.
Furthermore, our data demonstrated that inhibiting
the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway could reduce the
proliferation of three GSC PDCs. However, the inhibition
activity has not been evaluated in vivo, because none of
three GSC PDCs could develop tumors in nude mice.
Although our in vitro study suggested that this GSC

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical information of a patient with
gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma
A 65-year-old male presented with abdominal pain.
Laboratory tests showed HCVAb (-), HBsAg (+), HBeAg
(-), HBeAb (-), HBcAb (+), CEA (3.1 ng/ml), AFP (4.3 ng/
ml) and CA125 (3.1 ng/ml). This patient had an elevated
CA19-9 (95.0 U/ml) and his total bilirubin is 121.2μm/L
at an abnormal level. Detailed clinical information
was described in Supplementary Table S1. Magnetic
Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and CT
(Supplementary Figure S1) demonstrated interruption
of extrahepatic bile duct structure and gallbladder wall
thickening, suggesting malignant lesions occurred.
The gallbladder tumor was resected, but a
curative resection was impossible due to massive
lymphadenopathy of aortic, vena cava and celiac areas.
Pathology examination revealed a 4.2 X 3 cm gray mass
in the gallbladder neck with (gallbladder) mesenchymal
malignant tumor features. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining showed the characteristic of this tumor
tissue in conformity with the one of leiomyosarcoma
(Supplementary Figure S2).

Patient-derived cells (PDC) derived from a single
patient with gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma
Fresh gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma tissue
was placed in culture dishes with proper amount of PBS
followed by removal of tissue blood (blood clots), fat,
necrotic tissue and connective tissue by ophthalmological
forceps and scissors. Subsequently, the cancer tissue was
moved into a new dish filled with PBS, and was cut into
approximately 1 mm3 pieces using ophthalmological
forceps and scissors. All pieces were rinsed with PBS for
several times and placed into culture flasks with 5 ml of
collagenase. After the pieces were digested adequately, the
flasks were placed in a shaker at 37°C. When the tissue
pieces show good light transmittance and flocculent shape
under microscope, they were then centrifuged at 1500
rpm for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was transferred

into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. The cell pellets were
washed for a few times with PBS and were incubated in
DMEM complete culture medium. Lastly, the culture was
transferred into a dish and grew until separated cells or cell
clusters were visible under an optical microscope. Three
GSC PDCs were successfully established from this single
patient with gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma. Detailed
descriptions of three GSC PDCs were shown in Figure 1
and Supplementary Table S2.

Three GSC PDCs (JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002,
and JXQ-3D-003) were respectively inoculated in 6-well
plates for in vitro analyses. When the cells became 70%
to 80% confluent, they were treated with 0 and 1μmol/L
GDC-0941 or 0 and 0.5μmol/L PF-04691502 for 6
hours. Cells were washed with cold PBS, and lysate was
collected using the RIPA protein extraction reagent. The
Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific) was used
to quantitate the lysates. Twenty micrograms of protein
were loaded and run on 10-well 10% SDS -Tris Gels. All
antibodies were incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin
(Sigma). Antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology, or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibodies
used were pAKT (Ser473), AKT, pS6 (Ser235/6), p70S6K
(S6) and Actin.

Cell culture and compounds
Three GSC PDCs (JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002, and
JXQ-3D-003) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
5% FBS. Cells were grown in humidified atmosphere at
5% CO2 and 37°C.
Inhibitors for pan-PI3K (GDC-0941), dual
PI3K/mTOR (PF-04691502) and chemotherapy drugs
(Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin) were from
Selleckchem group.

Immunohistochemistry
Clinical samples in FFPE were cut into 5 μm sections
and placed on positively-charged slides. Hematoxylin and
eosin (HE) stained tissue was analyzed by a pathologist to
confirm histology. For IHC of pan-cytokeratin (CK), Ki67,
Heppar-1, CAM5.2, Vimetin, CK19 and SMA, slides were
deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was with
10 mM sodium citrate at pH 6.0 under pressure. Slides
were washed in PBS. Endogenous peroxidases were
blocked with 3% H2O2 in methanol. For CK, Heppar-1,
CAM5.2, CK19 and SMA, slides were blocked with
Ctyo-Q immune-diluent (Innovex Biosciences, NB307)
followed by primary antibody incubation in Ctyo-Q
immune diluent. Antibody concentrations were as
follows: pan-Cytokeratin-1:500 (Sant Cruz, sc-81714),
HepPar-1-1:100 (Dako, clone OCHIE5), CAM5.2-1:200
(Sigma, 452M-9), Vimetin-1:500 (Abcam, ab137321),
CK19-1:500 (Abcam, ab52625) and SMA-1:500 (Gene
Tex, GTX100034). After primary antibody, slides were
washed in PBS. Primary antibody detection was achieved
with Mach 4 HRP polymer (Biocare Medical), followed
by 3,3’-diaminobenzidine incubation. Slides were
counterstained with Gill’s Hematoxylin then washed
in water and PBS. Slides were sealed with Universal
Mount (Open Biosystems, MBI1232). For Ki-67 (Abgent,
AJ1427b), primary antibodies were used at concentrations
of 1:200 in 10% normal goat serum. After incubation,
slides were washed and blocked with 5% goat serum in
1X PBS. Primary antibody detection was visualized using
an anti-rabbit HRP secondary at 1:500 in 5% goat serum
(Vector Labs, PI-1000) and DAB substrate. Slides were
counterstained as described above.

Cell proliferation assay
A cell counter was used to measure cell proliferation.
Three GSC PDCs (JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002, and JXQ3D-003) were seeded in 6-well plates (one plate per PDC)
at the same density. Cells in each well were counted every
day for six days in a row.

Wound-healing assay
Three GSC PDCs (JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002, and
JXQ-3D-003) were grown to confluence, and the wound
was introduced by scraping the cell monolayer with a
pipette tip p/200. After scraping the wound, the growth
medium were changed with the one supplemented with
3% FBS. Each wound was photographed under a light
microscope at a magnification of 40X at 0 hour and 24
hours. The assay has been repeated at least three times.

Colony-Formation Assay
The cells were seeded at 500-800 cells per well in
6-well plates containing complete DMEM on day 0 and
incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 15 days. On day 15,
cells were fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde for 15 min
and stained with 1% crystal violet before quantification.
To study the effect of chemotherapy drugs to the
colony-formation activities of the three GSC PDCs, cells
were seeded as described above. The cells were exposed to
Fluorouracil (0 μM, 5 μM), Doxorubicin (0 μM, 0.1 μM),
or Cisplatin (0 μM, 150 μM) for 15 days respectively.
The cells were fixed and stained as described above. The
experiments were triplicated, and the numbers of colonies
containing more than 50 cells were microscopically
counted.

Coverslips were then rinsed three times with PBS,
and the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at room temperature.
After coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS, they
were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (TBST
containing 5% bovine serum albumin) for 15 minutes
at room temperature and then incubated with primary
antibody (pan-cytokeratin, Sant Cruz, 1:200) for 1 h at
room temperature. Then, coverslips were washed three
times with TBST and incubated for 30 minutes at room
with Alexa-Fluor 488-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG.

Germany).

matched normal controls (BLD). A full list of SNV events
and CNAs are presented in Supplementary Table S4 and
Supplementary Table S5.

In vitro cell viability studies
For cell viability studies, cells were plated in
quadruplicate at a density of 4,000 cells per well in
96-well plates in regular growth medium and allowed
to adhere overnight. The compound (Fluorouracil,
Doxorubicin, Cisplatin, GDC-0941, PF-04691502 and
so on) dose-response was determined by treating with
10 concentrations based on a 3-fold dilution series. Cell
viability was measured after 72 hours incubation using
the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega). The concentration of drug resulting in 50%
inhibition of cell viability (IC50) was calculated from a
four-parameter curve analysis and was determined from
a minimum of three experiments. Mean IC50 values and
SDs from three experiments with inhibitors are shown in
Supplementary Table S6.

The whole exome sequencing
The qualified genomic DNAs were from three GSC
PDCs (JXQ-3D-001, JXQ-3D-002, JXQ-3D-003) and this
patient blood and were randomly fragmented by Covaris,
ligated to Illumina sequenced adapters, and selected for
lengths from 150 to 200 bp. Extracted DNAs were then
amplified by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), purified,
and hybridized to the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome
(44M) array for enrichment. Hybridized fragments
were bound to the streptavidin beads, whereas nonhybridized fragments were washed out after 24 hr. We then
subjected captured LM-PCR products to the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer to estimate the magnitude of enrichment.
We independently loaded each captured library from the
process described above on three lanes of a NextSeq 500
platform with 100-bp paired-end reads for high-throughput
sequencing to ensure that each sample met the desired
average coverage. Detailed description of sequencing QC
is presented in Supplementary Table S4.

Statistics
Results of compound IC50s are reported as mean
values ± standard deviation (SD) from three independent
experiments. Colony counts in each group were obtained
from the GelCount (Oxford Optronix, United Kingdom)
and analyzed using a standard student’s T-test.

were identified by MuTect, a Bayesian algorithm; short
insertions and deletions determined by local assembly.
To detect DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs), we
performed SegSeq11 to infer somatic CNA in genomes
on the basis of WES reads. Copy numbers < 1.5 were
considered to indicate deletions, and those > 2.5 were
considered amplifications by comparison to process
