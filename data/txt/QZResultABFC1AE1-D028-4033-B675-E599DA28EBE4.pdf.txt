Abstract
The EGF receptor (EGFR) HER3 is emerging as an attractive cancer therapeutic target due to its central position
in the HER receptor signaling network. HER3 ampliﬁes phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–driven tumorigenesis
and its upregulation in response to other anti-HER therapies has been implicated in resistance to them. Here, we
report the development and characterization of RG7116, a novel anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed
to block HER3 activation, downregulate HER3, and mediate enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC) via glycoengineering of the Fc moiety. Biochemical studies and X-ray crystallography
revealed that RG7116 bound potently and selectively to domain 1 of human HER3. Heregulin binding was
prevented by RG7116 at concentrations more than 1 nmol/L as was nearly complete inhibition of HER3
heterodimerization and phosphorylation, thereby preventing downstream AKT phosphorylation. In vivo RG7116
treatment inhibited xenograft tumor growth up to 90% relative to controls in a manner accompanied by
downregulation of cell surface HER3. RG7116 efﬁcacy was further enhanced in combination with anti-EGFR
(RG7160) or anti-HER2 (pertuzumab) mAbs. Furthermore, the ADCC potency of RG7116 was enhanced compared
with the nonglycoengineered parental antibody, both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xenograft models, where an
increased median survival was documented. ADCC degree achieved in vitro correlated with HER3 expression
levels on tumor cells. In summary, the combination of strong signaling inhibition and enhanced ADCC capability
rendered RG7116 a highly potent HER3-targeting agent suitable for clinical development. Cancer Res; 73(16);

Introduction
HER3 (ERBB3) is a member of the HER family of transmembrane receptors. By homo- and heterodimerization, these
receptors form a complex overlapping signaling network that
regulates cell differentiation, migration, proliferation, and
survival (1, 2). HER monomers are predominantly in an inactive
"closed" conformation. Activation occurs following ligand
binding by receptor dimerization and subsequent transphosphorylation within the dimerized receptor pair. HER3 is
unique in that it lacks signiﬁcant kinase activity (3) and does
not form stable homodimers (4); thus it depends on HER1 [EGF

receptor (EGFR)], HER2 (ERBB2), or HER4 (ERBB4) as heterodimerization partners. Within the HER family, HER3 is the
most potent in activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT pathway, as its intracellular domain contains
multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites that recruit the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3K. HER2–HER3 heterodimers constitute a high-afﬁnity coreceptor pair for heregulin [HRG
(NRG1)], the predominant ligand for HER3 (5–7), and form
the most potent dimeric HER signaling complex—strongly
activating diverse cellular pathways such as the RAS/RAF/
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the PI3K/AKT
pathways (8, 9).
Deregulation of HER signaling is a key mechanism by which
tumor cells can evade normal growth constraints. Several antiHER agents are widely used clinically, including the anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab, the anti-HER2 mAb
trastuzumab, and the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib
and geﬁtinib. The importance of HER3 in cancer has only
recently emerged; upregulation of HER3 is an adverse prognostic factor in many tumor types and is associated with worse
survival (10–14).
HER3 has also been implicated in the development of
resistance to anti-EGFR or anti-HER2 therapy (15–17). A shift
from HER1 homodimer to HER1/HER3 heterodimer signaling
in response to sustained treatment with EGFR inhibitors leads
to reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and bypasses the

therapeutic action of these compounds (18). Upregulation of
HER3 seems to be driven by negative feedback from AKT (18).
Ampliﬁcation of the tyrosine kinase receptor MET induces
HER3 phosphorylation and PI3K activation, representing
another mechanism by which HER3 confers resistance to
EGFR-targeting therapies (19).
Therefore, anti-HER3 mAbs are attractive both as therapeutic inhibitors of HER3 signaling in their own right and as
potentiators of other anti-HER therapies. Understanding the
molecular basis of signaling inhibition by therapeutic mAbs is
important for their clinical development and is greatly helped
by combining crystallography, biophysical characterization of
antigen/antibody complexes, and thermodynamic analysis of
the molecular forces that drive complex formation (20).
Although the anti-EGFR mAb matuzumab (21) is believed to
act solely by blocking conformational changes required for
EGF binding and receptor dimerization, the mAbs cetuximab
(22), IMC-11F8 (23), and zalutumumab (24) also occlude the
ligand-binding site. To achieve highly potent and speciﬁc
receptor inhibition, an enthalpy-driven key and lock binding
mechanism typical for a fully matured antibody–antigen interaction is advantageous, as it can freeze an inactive receptor
conformation by a network of directed interactions at the
binding interface.
In addition to signaling inhibition, mAbs of the immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1) subtype can also exert a therapeutic effect
by recruiting host immune effector cells such as natural killer
(NK) cells that are capable of killing tumor cells via antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). A critical step in
the activation of cytotoxic cells is the binding of mAbs to
FcgRIIIa (FCGR3A) on immune effector cells, and the strength
of this interaction is determined by antibody isotype, the
glycosylation pattern of the antibody Fc region and FcgRIIIa
polymorphisms (25–27). In particular, the afﬁnity of human
IgG1 to FcgRIIIa is higher when oligosaccharides lack the
variable fucose attachment (28). Glycoengineering of the Fc
portion is an established method for increasing the afﬁnity of
therapeutic mAbs for Fcg receptors on human immune effector cells and for enhancing ADCC (28, 29).
Our aim was to generate a glycoengineered anti-HER3 IgG1
antibody that would combine complete HER3 signaling inhibition with enhanced ADCC. Here, we report the full characterization of this novel therapeutic mAb.

Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) Eagle medium (PAN Biotech GmbH) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA Laboratories) at 37 C in a water-saturated atmosphere containing
5% CO2. Using standard recombinant techniques, a series of
A549 transfectant cell clones were generated that overexpressed
HER3 at different levels (measured by ﬂow cytometry).
Production and glycoengineering of RG7116
NMRI mice were immunized with recombinant HER3 extracellular domain (ECD). The antibody described here (RG7116)
was selected from multiple anti-HER3 clones examined on the
basis of the results described later. Humanization was carried
out as described previously (30) and glycoengineering of RG7116
was achieved using GlycoMab technology (Roche Glycart AG;
refs. 31, 32). Glycoengineered RG7116 exhibited a 50-fold higher
binding afﬁnity for FcgRIIIa than nonglycoengineered RG7116.

Materials and Methods

Surface plasmon resonance
The equilibrium and transition state thermodynamic proﬁles of cetuximab and RG7116 were determined by surface
plasmon resonance technology. Temperature-dependent
kinetics were measured using a T200 instrument (GE Healthcare, Biacore). A CM5 series S sensor was used according to
the manufacturers' instructions (system buffer: 10 mmol/L
HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20; sample
buffer: system buffer supplemented with 1 mg/mL carboxymethyldextran; Sigma). An anti-human antibody capture
system was established on the biosensor and 8,000 relative
response units of goat-anti-human Fcg fragment-speciﬁc
polyclonal antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) was immobilized using EDC/NHS chemistry. The sensor was deactivated
using 1 mol/L ethanolamine.
The temperature-dependent binding kinetics (33) of cetuximab and RG7116 were measured between 13 C and 37 C.
Cetuximab was captured by a 1 minute injection (10 mL/min)
of 10 (13 C) 8 (17 C), 7 (21 C), 6 (25 C–34 C), and 5 nmol/L
(37 C). Similarly, RG7116 was captured at concentrations of 7
(13 C), 6 (17 C), and 5 nmol/L (21 C–37 C). HER1-ECD (68 kDa)
and HER3-ECD (68 kDa) were injected (100 mL/min) in a
concentration series of 90, 30, 2 10, 3.3, 1.1, and 0 nmol/L
(buffer control). The association phase was monitored for 3
minutes and the dissociation phase was measured for 15 minutes. Acidic sensor regeneration was done using three consecutive injections of 10 mmol/L glycine pH 1.5 (30 mL/min) for 30
seconds. Kinetic parameters of the antibody/receptor domain
were calculated (Supplementary Material).

Cell lines
Human breast (MCF7, MDA-MB-175, T-47D, BT-474, and SKBR3), head and neck squamous (SCCHN; FaDu), pancreatic
(BxPC3), and lung (QG56, A549, NCI-H322M, NCI-H1975,
HCC827, and NCI-H441) cancer cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection or Immuno-Biological
Laboratories. Cell lines obtained from these suppliers are
routinely authenticated by karyotyping, short-tandem repeat
proﬁling, assessment of cell morphology, and species veriﬁcation by isoenzymology. Cell lines were expanded upon receipt
and aliquots frozen. Cells were not passaged for more than 6
months after resuscitation. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 or

Crystallization, structure determination, and

The HER3-ECD::Fab(RG7116) complex was crystallized at
20 C using hanging drop vapor diffusion. HER3-ECD::Fab
(RG7116) crystallized in space group P1 with 1 molecule per
asymmetric unit. Data to a limiting resolution of 2.64 Å were
collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
(Beamline ID23-2). The HER3-ECD::Fab(RG7116) structure
was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (34). The

the Fab(RG7116) fragment, and a previously reported structure of the Fab constant region (PDB accession code 3U1S;
ref. 36) were used as search models. Protein preparation,
crystallization, structure determination, and reﬁnement statistics, including a crystallographic table, are described in the
Supplementary Material.
HRG displacement assay
RG7116 diluted in Delﬁa Binding Buffer (PerkinElmer) was
added to streptavidin-binding protein-tagged HER3-ECD
immobilized onto streptavidin-coated microtiter plates (ﬁnal
concentration, 103 to 103 nmol/L). Plates were incubated at
room temperature for 2 hours with 10 nmol/L europiumlabeled HRG-b (PeproTech) with agitation. After three washes
with Delﬁa Wash Buffer, plates were incubated in Delﬁa
Enhancement Solution for 15 minutes and scanned on a Tecan
Inﬁnite F200 reader using a time-resolved ﬂuorescence measurement protocol.
Inhibition of HER3 and AKT phosphorylation by RG7116
Serial RG7116 concentrations were incubated with MCF7 or
FaDu cells for 50 minutes at 37 C/5% CO2. HRG was added
(ﬁnal concentration, 500 ng/mL) and cells were incubated for
another 10 minutes. For BT-474, SK-BR3, and MDA-MB-175
cells, RG7116 was incubated without HRG stimulation. Following PBS washes, cells were lysed in Triton Lysis Buffer (1%
Triton X-100, 10 mg/mL aprotinin, 0.4 mmol/L orthovanadate,
and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride) and lysates were
denatured in NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent at 70 C for 10
minutes. Standard SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were
conducted using an anti-phospho-HER3 [clone 21D3 (Tyr1289);
Cell Signaling Technologies] or anti-HER3 (clone C-17; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Signal was detected using electrochemiluminescence (Amersham) and percentage inhibition
of HER3 receptor phosphorylation was calculated. For analysis
of phospho-HER3 in BxPC3 xenograft tumors, lysates were
prepared, 20 mg protein/lane was separated by SDS-PAGE, and
Western blotting for HER3 and phospho-HER3 was conducted.
Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was examined in MCF7
cells treated with different concentrations of RG7116 and
5 ng/L HRG. Following cell lysis, phosphorylated AKT levels
were measured using the anti-phospho-AKT (pSer473) enzyme
immune assay kit (Enzo Life Sciences).
In vitro inhibition of proliferation of MDA-MB-175 cells
Of note, 20,000 cells per well were seeded into microtiter
plates with Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12
medium containing 10% FCS and incubated at 37 C/5% CO2
for 1 day. Serial RG7116 dilutions were added and further
incubated for 6 days. Cell viability was assessed using the
alamarBlue assay (Invitrogen). EC50 values were calculated
using means of triplicates for each antibody concentration.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry of formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded BxPC3 xenografts was conducted semiautomatically on a
DAKO autostainer using the DAK-H3-IC anti-HER3 mouse
antibody (Dako).

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
RG7116 (10 mg/mL) was added to T-47D cells and membrane
HER3 levels were measured by ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS). A phycoetherin-labeled secondary mAb was
used to detect levels of RG7116 bound to surface HER3. Ten
thousand cells were measured and the geometric means of the
ﬂuorescence signal were normalized to untreated cells (representing background ﬂuorescence levels).
Mouse xenograft models
Subcutaneous xenograft models were generated using
human tumor cell lines or by implantation of human tumor
fragments. Cell lines and fragments were selected on the basis
of a high phospho-HER3/HER3 ratio (analyzed by Western blot
analysis). All experiments were carried out according to German Animal Welfare Act guidelines.
Of note, 5 to 10  106 cells were injected subcutaneously
into female severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID)-beige
(BxPC3, QG56, A549, NCI-H322M, NCI-H441, and FaDu) or
Balb/c nude mice (HCC827 and NCI-H1975; Charles River
Laboratories). Mice (n ¼ 10/group) were randomized on day
21 to 24 (stratiﬁed for primary tumor size) and treatment
was started. RG7116 (10–25 mg/kg; n ¼ 2–5 doses) was given
once weekly intraperitoneally (i.p.), RG7160 (anti-EGFR) at
25 mg/kg once weekly i.p., and pertuzumab (anti-HER2) at
15 mg/kg once weekly i.p. with a 2-fold loading dose ﬁrst.
The percentage tumor growth inhibition (TGI) compared
with controls (saline-treated) was calculated (Supplementary Material).
Subcutaneous patient-derived tumor xenografts models
were evaluated at Oncotest GmbH or EPO GmbH by transplantation of small human tumor fragments onto NMRI nude
mice. Mice were randomized (n ¼ 10/group) and therapy was
conducted as described earlier.
For an orthotopic cell line–based xenograft mouse model,
HER3 recombinant A549-B34 cells were injected intravenously
(3  106 cells) into female SCID-beige mice (Taconics). Mice
(n ¼ 15/group) were randomized when lung tumor growth
was conﬁrmed in scout animals (day 23). Mice received 10 to
13 weekly i.p. injections of 25 mg/kg RG7116, nonglycoengineered RG7116, or saline control. Median survival was deﬁned
as the day when 50% or more of animals/group were sacriﬁced
(termination criterion: body weight loss). Survival data were
represented using Kaplan–Meier curves and differences in
median survival were compared with the pairwise log-rank
test.
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays
ADCC was conducted using Delﬁa BATDA Labeling Reagent
and Delﬁa Eu-Solution (PerkinElmer) and high-afﬁnity (V158)FcgRIIIa receptor-expressing NK92 effector cells. Effector:target (E:T) ratios of 5:1 (T-47D target cells) or 20:1 (A549 target
cells) and a 2-hour incubation time were used. Percentagespeciﬁc cell lysis [(speciﬁc release)  (spontaneous release
target cell)/(maximum release target cell)  (spontaneous
release target cell)] was calculated from the mean of triplicates
and plotted against antibody concentration in ng/mL using a 4parameter ﬁt.

Results
Afﬁnity of RG7116 for human HER3
RG7116 bound selectively and with high afﬁnity to the ECD
of human HER3. Using surface plasmon resonance, the binding
afﬁnity of RG7116 to immobilized HER3-ECD was compared
with that of cetuximab to HER1.
Kinetic data
The afﬁnities (KD values) at 25 C were 0.5 nmol/L for RG7116
and 1.7 nmol/L for cetuximab. The 3-fold higher afﬁnity of
RG7116 is due to a much slower dissociation rate compared with
cetuximab: the association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants for the RG7116/HER3 interaction were 1.79  105 1/Ms
and 8.82  105 1/s, respectively, and for the cetuximab/HER1
interaction were 6.78  105 1/Ms and 1.12  103 1/s, respectively. RG7116 showed a higher antigen complex stability than
cetuximab (t1/2-diss ¼ 131 vs. 10 minutes for cetuximab), a highly
desirable feature for immune effector cell recruitment. Kinetic
data for the complete temperature gradient are presented in
Supplementary Table S1. At RMAX, both antibodies bound their
respective antigen in solution with a molar ratio of 2.
Thermodynamic data
A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of the conformational states in the antibody/receptor interactions was conducted and the energy transition of the free standard binding
enthalpy (DG z), standard binding enthalpy (DH z), and standard binding entropy (TDS z) are shown in Fig. 1, with detailed
data in Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S1.
Structure of the HER3-ECD::Fab(RG7116) complex
To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the very
potent inhibition of HER3 signaling by RG7116, we determined
the crystal structure of a HER3-ECD::Fab(RG7116) complex
with a maximal resolution of 2.6 Å by molecular replacement.

In agreement with previous epitope-mapping results, the
complex structure reveals a speciﬁc interaction of Fab
(RG7116) with domain 1 of HER3-ECD (Fig. 2A). HER3-ECD
is a monomer within the complex with a conformation highly
similar to the previously reported apo-HER3-ECD structure
(Supplementary Fig. S2A; ref. 35). This conformation is commonly accepted to represent the ligand unbound, "inactive"
state of the receptor, in which an intramolecular tethering
interaction between b-hairpin loops from domain 2 and 4
prevents receptor dimerization (Fig. 2A; ref. 37).
The accuracy of the structure was veriﬁed by calculating a
2Fo-Fc electron density composite omit map with the program
Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) (38). Importantly, all
residues in the HER3-ECD::Fab(RG7116) interface, including
the side chains, are well deﬁned in this map (Supplementary
Fig. S2B).
Fab(RG7116) forms a broad network of interactions with the
L domain-like b-barrel of HER3-ECD domain 1 (Fig. 2B and C).
The calculated interface between HER3 and Fab(RG7116)
buries an area of 928 Å2 (Fig. 2B; ref. 39). Both the Fab(RG7116)
heavy (608 Å2 interface with HER3-ECD) and light chain (373 Å2
interface with HER3-ECD) contribute to binding of the HER3ECD epitope. This corresponds well to other comparable Fabantigen complexes such as cetuximab::EGFR, which exhibits a
buried surface area of 875 Å2 (577 Å2 heavy chain::receptor and
358 Å2 light chain::receptor interface, respectively; ref. 22).
Epitope binding on HER3-ECD domain 1 is mediated by
residues from Fab(RG7116) heavy chain CDR1, CDR2, and
CDR3 and light chain CDR1 and CDR3 (Fig. 2C). The observed
interface consists not only of hydrophobic and aromatic–
aromatic side chain interactions, but also notably of several
hydrogen bond, ionic-, and cation–p interactions. Overall, it is
of relatively polar nature, which becomes apparent from the
electrostatic surface potential map of the Fab(RG7116) epitope (Supplementary Fig. S2C).

Figure 1. Surface plasmon resonance data showing the thermodynamic proﬁle of RG7116/HER3 (triangles) and cetuximab/HER1 (circles). RG7116 and
cetuximab showed comparable thermodynamic proﬁles. The energy value is set to zero when reagents are separated from each other (AþB). During the
association phase, the kinetic energy overcomes the repulsive forces between the reactants and an activated complex is being formed (AB, the
transition state). From the transition state, the molecules can dissociate back to AþB or can further transform into the ﬁnal equilibrium complex (AB).
Left, the standard association free binding enthalpy (DG zass) was 43 kJ/mol for RG7116 and 40 kJ/mol for cetuximab. The standard equilibrium free
binding enthalpy (DG ) was 53 kJ/mol for RG7116 and 50 kJ/mol for cetuximab. Middle, both antibodies show standard activation enthalpies
(DH zass; 28 kJ/mol for RG7116 and 31 kJ/mol for cetuximab). The standard equilibrium binding enthalpy (DH ) for RG7116 was 70 kJ/mol versus 64
kJ/mol for cetuximab. Right, the standard entropic term of the association phase (TDS zass) was 15 kJ/mol for RG7116 and 9 kJ/mol for
cetuximab and the standard equilibrium binding entropy (TDS ) was 17 kJ/mol for RG7116 and 14 kJ/mol for cetuximab. Within the error of the
measurements, both antibodies behave in thermodynamically similar mode of actions.

hydrophobic but also polar and electrostatic interactions, which involve residues from HC CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, and LC CDR1 and CDR3. Left,
interactions between HC CDRs (dark blue) and HER3-ECD domain 1 (orange). Right, interactions between LC CDRs (cyan) and HER3-ECD domain 1
(orange). The Fab(RG7116) backbone region is colored in gray. Ordered water molecules are depicted as spheres (light red).

Binding of Fab(RG7116) leads to almost no signiﬁcant
conformational changes in HER3-ECD domain 1 as a superposition of apo-HER3-ECD (35) and HER3-ECD::Fab(RG7116)
complex crystal structures with PyMOL shows a low root
mean square deviation of 0.53 Å (Ca atoms only; Supplementary Fig. S2D). This is in line with the thermodynamic proﬁle
of HER3-ECD::Fab(RG7116) complex formation, which is
characteristic for an enthalpy-dominated key-and-lock mechanism (Fig. 1). The crystal structure also provides an explanation for the negative entropic term of the HER3-ECD::Fab
(RG7116) complex observed in the thermodynamic analysis,
as it shows several ordered water molecules in the interface
(Fig. 2C).
Taken together, the anti-HER3 antibody binds its epitope on
the HER3-ECD domain 1 with a well-balanced composition of
polar and nonpolar interactions "freezing" the inactive, tethered conformation of HER3.

RG7116 prevents HRG ligand binding and inhibits
downstream phosphorylation and cell proliferation
The ability of RG7116 to competitively inhibit the binding
of HRG to HER3 and prevent receptor phosphorylation,
downstream signaling, and cell proliferation was investigated in vitro. In a Delﬁa assay, RG7116 prevented binding
of HRG to the HER3-ECD with an IC50 of 0.13 nmol/L
(Fig. 3A). Bound HRG was completely displaced at RG7116
concentrations 1 nmol/L. This translated into a dosedependent inhibition of HER3 phosphorylation in MCF7
(breast) and FaDu (hypopharynx) cancer cells. HER3 phosphorylation in MCF7 cells induced by 70 nmol/L HRG was
almost completely inhibited (>85%) when coincubated
with RG7116 at concentrations more than 0.3 mg/mL
(2 nmol/L; Fig. 3B). A similar complete inhibition of HER3
phosphorylation was seen in FaDu cells with 0.1 mg/mL
(0.7 nmol/L) RG7116. Furthermore, RG7116 inhibited

RG7116 treatment results in strong TGI of mouse
xenograft tumors
The in vivo activity of RG7116 was investigated using subcutaneous mouse xenograft models representing pancreatic
cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, SCCHN, and non–small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). All models showed signiﬁcant
levels of phosphorylated HER3, indicative of active HER3
signaling; therefore, growth of these tumors was suspected to
depend at least in part on the HER3 pathway. These subcutaneous xenograft models contain no or very few immune
effector cells at the tumor site; therefore, these models reﬂect
mostly antitumor efﬁcacy mediated via HER3 signaling inhibition with little or no contribution from ADCC.
RG7116 showed dose-dependent TGI in a BxPC3 mouse
xenograft model (Fig. 4A). Intraperitoneal doses of 0.3 to
25 mg/kg RG7116 were highly efﬁcacious, achieving more than
90% TGI compared with controls. Only partial TGI was
achieved with 0.1 mg/kg RG7116, indicating suboptimal dosing. Phospho-HER3 levels were markedly reduced in tumor
tissue obtained from mice treated with RG7116 at doses
0.3 mg/kg as compared with controls (Fig. 4B). Only the

IC50 of 0.42 nmol/L (0.06 mg/mL; Fig. 3C).
HER3 activation in the presence of ligand and HER3 activation by overexpressed HER2 may not follow the same biologic
mechanism; therefore, the effect of RG7116 on phospho-HER3
levels in the absence of extraneous added HRG ligand was
measured. Inhibition of phospho-HER3 levels was seen using a
series of breast cell lines (Fig. 3D), including the MDA-MB-175
cell line in which the oncogenic signal arises from an autocrine
HRG growth loop. RG7116-induced downregulation of membrane HER3 in the absence of HRG was investigated in T-47D
breast cells. A time-dependent decrease in surface HER3 was
shown by FACS (Fig. 3E), reaching levels seen in unstained
control cells by 5 hours post-RG7116 treatment.
The antiproliferative potential associated with blocking
HER3 signaling by RG7116 was examined in vitro using MDAMB-175 human breast cancer cells (doubling time, 1.5 days).
After 6 days of incubation with a range of RG7116 concentrations, the maximal growth inhibition achieved was approximately 60% as compared with control cells (Fig. 3F). The EC50
for RG7116-mediated growth inhibition was 8.5 nmol/L.

suboptimal dose (0.1 mg/kg RG7116) failed to inhibit HER3
phosphorylation completely. When explanted tissue was
examined by immunohistochemistry, the efﬁcacious doses of
RG7116 seemed to downmodulate membrane HER3 compared
with controls and tumors treated with 0.1 mg/kg RG7116 (Fig.
4C), thus conﬁrming the Western blotting results.
Single-agent RG7116 induced potent TGI in HER3-positive
human NSCLC models (Fig. 5). Many of these models show
resistance to established therapies, including anti-HER therapies (see Supplementary Material). Treatment with 4 to 6
cycles of weekly RG7116 at doses of 10 to 25 mg/kg resulted in
strong TGI in 5 of 6 squamous NSCLC models, including tumor
stasis or complete remission in 3 of 6 (Fig. 5A). Figure 5B shows
an example (LXFE722, squamous NSCLC) in which complete
remission was achieved. In the LXFE646 model, where singleagent RG7116 did not inhibit tumor growth, tumor stasis was
achieved when RG7116 was combined with cetuximab (antiHER1; data not shown). Substantial TGI (>50%) was also
observed in 5 of 10 adenocarcinoma NSCLC xenograft models
(Fig. 5A).

When combined with anti-HER1 (RG7160) or anti-HER2
(pertuzumab) antibodies, RG7116 efﬁcacy was enhanced in
models where HER1 (FaDu; Fig. 5C) or HER2 (MAXF449; Fig.
5D) is the preferred heterodimerization partner, respectively.
Combination treatment led to long lasting and complete
tumor regression in both instances.
In vitro and in vivo ADCC
In addition to inhibiting tumor growth via blockage of
HER3 and subsequent downstream signaling, RG7116 also
showed enhanced cell killing via ADCC. Using high-afﬁnity
(V158)-FcgRIIIa–expressing NK92 NK cells as effector cells
and T-47D breast cancer cells as target cells (E:T ratio 5:1),
cell killing with RG7116 was markedly enhanced compared
with its nonglycoengineered version (Fig. 6A). At RG7116
concentrations of more than 100 ng/mL, speciﬁc cell killing
of 65% was achieved.
The inﬂuence of HER3 receptor density on the ADCC
potential of RG7116 was investigated in vitro using T-47D
cells [21,800 receptors per cell (rpc)] and a series of
A549 cell lines recombinantly expressing HER3 at densities of 1,800 to 34,200 rpc. These experiments clearly

The A549 subcutaneous model has very poor immune
inﬁltration and therapeutic efﬁcacy will reﬂect only HER3
signaling inhibition but not Fc-related effector functions. In
this model, RG7116 achieved identical TGI to that seen with
the nonglycoengineered version (data not shown). To investigate the additional antitumoral impact of Fc glycoengineering
of RG7116 in vivo, a more realistic A549 lung orthotopic
xenograft model characterized by signiﬁcant inﬁltration of
macrophages (40) was used. SCID-beige mice (n ¼ 15/group)
intravenously injected with A549-B34 cells (14,400 rpc) were
treated with weekly intraperitoneal vehicle, glycoengineered
RG7116 or nonglycoengineered RG7116, once scout animals
had developed lung tumors. Median survival was signiﬁcantly
prolonged in animals treated with the glycoengineered form of
RG7116 (92 days; 95% CI, 78–99 days) compared with nonglycoengineered RG7116 (75 days; 95% CI, 68–82; P ¼ 0.0001)
or vehicle (57 days; 95% CI, 54–61 days; P ¼ 0.0004; Fig. 6C).

Because of its lack of intrinsic kinase activity and its inability
to homodimerize, HER3 requires other HER family members as
heterodimerization partners for signaling. This may explain
why there are no known tumors with HER3 gene ampliﬁcation
or HER3 "driver mutations." Until recently, HER3 was not
considered a target for immunotherapy for cancer (41), despite
the fact that it is the only HER family member that can very
effectively activate PI3K signaling, a key pathway for cell
proliferation and survival. However, this view changed when
it became apparent that heterodimers of HER3 with HER1 and
HER2 are the most active signaling dimers within the HER
family (6, 42) and also offer a major mechanism by which HERdriven tumors can escape from targeted therapy (15–18). HER3
is highly regulated and compensatory increases in transcription,
translation, protein stability, duration of its tyrosine phosphorylation, cell surface localization, and heterodimerization have
been implicated as key escape mechanisms underlying the
resistance to other HER-targeting therapies (41); the latter at
least in part through induction of autocrine ligand production.
To counter these multiple compensatory mechanisms, we
generated an anti-HER3 antibody that prevents binding of HRG
to the HER3-ECD (IC50: 0.13 nmol/L) and binds with high
afﬁnity (t1/2-diss ¼ 131 minutes) to HER3-ECD. Crystallography
data indicated that RG7116 binds to HER3 in the inactive,
tethered state, in which subdomains II and IV interact. However, this may also reﬂect the best uniform monomeric state
suitable for crystallization under the experimental conditions
investigated (pH 6). The inactivate receptor conformation
seems to favor engagement of the HER3 kinase domain in
homotypic interactions that further increase the barrier to
ligand-independent activation by sequestering HER3 into signaling-incapable receptor clusters and by covering in trans the
C-terminal tail containing the tyrosine phosphorylation sites
necessary for PI3K recruitment (43).
Superimposition of the apo-HER3-ECD structure with the one
bound by Fab(RG7116) showed no signiﬁcant conformational
changes. Thermodynamic analyses conﬁrmed that the binding
of RG7116 to the HER3-ECD is a fully enthalpy-dominated

interaction (20). The small activation enthalpy DH zass indicates that not much energy has to be spent on the disruption of
noncovalent RG7116 intramolecular bonds to allow the new
formation of intermolecular-RG7116/HER3-ECD forces. There is
a negative "entropic burden" for the interaction, suggesting that
no substantial solvent displacement, amino acid side chain
movements, or any major changes in the degrees of freedom
of the interacting reactants take place. No induced ﬁt mechanism could be identiﬁed. The supposed key-and-lock binding
mechanism is typical for a fully mature antibody–antigen
interaction (44). In this way, RG7116 behaves similar to cetuximab, where the EGFR interaction is also enthalpy-dominated.
Because there is no crystal structure of HER3 in complex with
one of its natural ligands reported so far, we cannot deﬁnitively
say whether RG7116 occludes the ligand-binding site on HER3
in a similar fashion as cetuximab does on HER1. Although tether
stabilization is an attractive model for the MoA of RG7116, other
mechanisms should not be ruled out. The localization of the
epitope recognized by RG7116 is such that it is not clear why
antibody binding would interfere with an extended conformation. Furthermore, the tethered species may even be capable of
ligand-independent interaction through an alternative interface. Kani and colleagues also claim that the "tethered" conformation of HER3 cannot be completely discarded for ligand
binding. HRG is assumed to bind to regions on domain 1 and
domain 3 of HER3 in a fashion similar to the EGF–HER1
interaction (37, 45). Therefore, we compared our HER3-ECD::
Fab(RG7116) complex structure with a previously reported
EGFR::EGF complex structure (46). Interestingly, the protein
chains of EGF and Fab(RG7116) at least partly overlap in space,
when both structures are aligned by the L domain-like b-barrel
of ECD subdomain 1. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that
RG7116 might inactivate HER3 not only allosterically by locking
the unliganded ECD conformation, but also by sterically blocking access to the ligand-binding site. In agreement with this, we
have seen competition between HRG and RG7116 for binding to
the HER3 ECD in the HRG displacement assay (Fig. 3A) and in
Biacore experiments (Unpublished Data).
The high afﬁnity of RG7116 for the unliganded HER3-ECD,
and high complex stability of HER3-bound RG7116, translated
into very potent HER3 signaling inhibition as shown by almost
complete abrogation of HER3 phosphorylation and AKT activation in several cancer cell lines in vitro. Importantly, inhibition
of HER3 activation by RG7116 was shown both in the presence
and absence of HRG ligand. Downregulation of membrane
HER3 upon RG7116 treatment was consistently observed, further contributing to its inhibition of HER3 signaling in vitro and
in vivo. HER3 downregulation by ligand-blocking antibodies has
been reported before for a-HER3-ECD antibody (47) and in
some cancer cell lines with MM-121 (48). The potent and
complete blockage of HER3 activation by RG7116 resulted in
substantial TGI in several mouse tumor xenograft models,
including some complete remissions. This efﬁcacy was achieved in models that were nonresponsive to other HER therapies
(cetuximab, erlotinib, and geﬁtinib), other targeted therapies,
and chemotherapeutic agents. The robust efﬁcacy seen with
RG7116 monotherapy in multiple preclinical models underscores the importance of HER3-containing heterodimers for

5192

Cancer Res; 73(16) August 15, 2013

tumor cell proliferation and survival, as RG7116 therapy does
not block signaling by homodimers of the corresponding HER3
dimerization partner.
HER3 has recently emerged as a major cause of treatment
failure for HER-targeted therapies; therefore, combining antiHER3 therapies with HER1- and HER2-targeting agents is a
clinically promising strategy. Combination treatment with
cetuximab and the HER3 antibody MM-121 led to a more
dramatic and sustained response than treatment with cetuximab alone (48). A very potent monospeciﬁc molecule such as
RG7116 will allow a free choice for tailoring combination
regimens with the best partner agent for different patients
and different tumor entities. We observed very long-lasting
tumor regression of FaDu and LXFE646 xenografts by combining RG7116 with RG7160 or cetuximab and of MAXF449
xenografts by combining RG7116 with pertuzumab. Delayed
resistance formation under a combination treatment with
cetuximab and the HER3 antibody MM-121 was recently also
shown by Schoeberl and colleagues (48). Despite high levels of
HER3 expression and activation, some tumors were not
responsive to RG7116 monotherapy; tumors with high levels
of total or activated c-MET were resistant to HER3 targeting.
These tumors could be treated by a combination of RG7116
and an anti-c-MET antibody in the future. Even more challenging will be the therapy for tumors such as NCI-H441 that
are characterized by high levels of HER3 expression, but
functional uncoupling of the PI3K pathway from HER3 signaling (in this case due to constitutive c-MET activation) and
constitutive MAPK pathway activation by RAS.
Antibody-mediated activation of NK cells and macrophages
contributes signiﬁcantly to tumor cell killing in patients (49).
RG7116 is glycoengineered for enhanced binding of the Fc
portion to FcgRIIIa on human immune effector cells such as
NK cells. This additional mode of action can counteract the
potential development of resistance to HER3 signaling inhibition and will broaden its therapeutic scope through inclusion
of tumors that have sufﬁciently high HER3 surface levels but do
not depend on HER3 signaling (e.g., due to c-MET upregulation). The inﬂuence of glycoengineering on the ADCC potential
of RG7116 was clearly shown in vitro (Fig. 6). As murine NK cells
lack FcgRIV (the murine homolog of human FcgRIIIa), the
contribution of immune effector cells to RG7116's MoA in vivo
is limited to murine monocytes and macrophages (which do
express FcgRIV). Using an orthotopic lung xenograft model of
A549, which shows high levels of macrophage inﬁltration (40),
we showed a clear survival beneﬁt of treatment with a glycoengineered versus nonglycoengineered RG7116 variant.
HER3 is an ideal target for a glycoengineered antibody, as it
is completely absent from peripheral blood cells and endothelium, and therefore is unlikely to cause infusion reactions seen
with glycoengineered antibodies against other targets. The
recombinant cells used for the in vivo efﬁcacy studies
expressed relatively high levels of HER3 (14,400 rpc), albeit
less than the endogenous level seen in tumor cell lines such as
T-47D. On the basis of the in vitro ADCC assay results, a
minimum expression level of 5,000 molecules per cell is
probably required for a signiﬁcant ADCC contribution to the
therapeutic effect of RG7116.

RG7116, a mAb Inhibitor of HER3 Signaling with Enhanced ADCC

In summary, RG7116 is an anti-HER3 antibody with a dual
mode of action. On the one hand, it stably binds to the inactive
conformation of HER3 and downregulates it, resulting in
complete HER3 signaling inhibition in vitro and superior
efﬁcacy in multiple preclinical tumor models. On the other
hand, its glycoengineered Fc portion allows efﬁcient engagement of immune effector cells, thereby contributing a signaling-independent component to its therapeutic efﬁcacy in
patients. RG7116 is currently in phase Ib clinical development.
