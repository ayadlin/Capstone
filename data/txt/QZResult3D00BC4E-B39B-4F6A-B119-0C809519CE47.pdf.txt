BACKGROUND: The authors studied the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of a taxane, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) (the TPF regimen) followed by concurrent chemoradiation, in 2 separately designed and synchronously executed phase 2 trials for stage III and IVA=IVB nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed NPC were accrued to 2 trials, 1
for patients with stage III disease and the other for patients with IVA=IVB disease. All patients received TPF (docetaxel 75 mg=m2, cisplatin 75 mg=m2, and 5-FU 2500 mg=m2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles) followed by cisplatin 40 mg=m2 per week concurrently with either 3-dimentional conformal radiation therapy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy. RESULTS: From January 2007 to July 2011,
52 eligible patients with stage III NPC and 64 eligible patients with nonmetastatic stage IV NPC were accrued. With a median followup of 32.9 months, the 3-year overall survival rates were 94.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.6%-100%) and 90.2% (95% CI, 81.8%98.6%) for the stage III NPC group and the IVA=IVB NPC group, respectively. The 3-year progression-free survival, distant metastasisfree survival, and local progression-free survival rates were 78.2% (95% CI, 64.6%-91.8%), 90.5% (95% CI, 79.7%-100%), and
93.9%(87.1%-100%), respectively, for patients with stage III NPC and 85.1% (95% CI, 75.1%-95.1%), 88% (95% CI, 78.6%-97.4%), and
100%, respectively, for patients with stage IVA=IVB NPC. The most common severe (grade 3=4) hematologic and nonhematologic
adverse events were neutropenia (64 patients; 55.2%) and nausea=vomiting (23 patients; 19.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant TPF
followed by concurrent chemoradiation was well tolerated and produced encouraging outcomes in patients with locally advanced

INTRODUCTION
Radiation therapy is the only curative treatment modality for nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx.
Concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment strategy for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) in locally advanced stages
(defined as a tumor classification of T3=T4 or positive lymph node [N1] status).1-6 However, the results after such treatment are suboptimal. Clearly, novel treatment strategies are needed to further improve patients’ survival rates.
The addition of a taxane to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (ie, the TPF regimen) before radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation has resulted in significantly improved treatment outcomes, including overall survival, in patients
with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), excluding NPC.7-9 Such synergistic effects provided by TPF
chemotherapy are equally attractive for its use in locoregionally advanced NPC. Therefore, we initiated 2 prospective
phase 2 clinical trials in 2007—1 for stage III NPC and another for nonmetastatic stage IV NPC—to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of induction TPF chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation using 3-dimensional (3D)-conformal
radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Here, we report the 3-year outcomes from those
trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients who had histologically proven, nonkeratinizing,
poorly differentiated and undifferentiated squamous cell
carcinoma of the nasopharynx in stage III and IVA=IVB
according to the 2002 American Joint Cancer Committee
(AJCC) staging criteria10 were eligible for the 2 prospective phase 2 clinical trials. Both trials had identical treatment regimens, were approved individually by the
institutional review boards, and were registered online
(National Clinical Trial [NCT] 00816855 for stage III
NPC and NCT 00816816 for stage IVA=IVB NPC).
Written informed consent was required for all participating patients.
In addition to disease stage at diagnosis, other eligibility criteria included: age >18 years and <70 year; an
expected lifespan of at least 6 months; a Karnofsky performance status score 70; and adequate bone marrow reserve
(neutrophil count >2000=L, platelet count 100,000=L,
and hemoglobin 10 g=dL), hepatic function (total bilirubin <1.5 mg=dL, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase
levels <2 times the upper limits of normal), and renal function (creatinine clearance rate >50 mL per minute).
Exclusion criteria included: pathology types other
than World Health Organization grade 2=3 NPC; stage
IVC (ie, metastatic) disease; previous radiotherapy or surgery to the head and neck for any malignant or nonmalignant disease(s); a history of malignant tumors or of
synchronous or multiple tumors, except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin; a positive pregnancy test for women;
accompanying disease or status influencing the normal
enrollment of patients or safety during the research; active
mental disorders or other mental disorders that influenced
the patient’s signature on the informed consent or comprehensibility; uncontrolled, active infections; and participation in other clinical research at the same time.

imaging examinations, including the primary tumor
(GTV-P) and metastatic lymph nodes (GTV-LN). The
clinical target volume (CTV) for high-risk (CTV-H), subclinical disease consisted of a 5-mm margin surrounding
the GTV, the whole nasopharyngeal cavity, the anterior 1
third or 2 thirds of the clivus (when invaded, the whole
clivus was covered), the skull base, the pterygoid plates,
the parapharyngeal space, the inferior sphenoid sinus (the
whole sphenoid sinus had to be covered for T3 and T4
disease), the posterior of the nasal cavity and the maxillary
sinus, and areas of lymph node drainage of the upper neck
(the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and levels II, III, and
Va). The low-risk CTV (CTV-L) referred to levels IV and
Vb without metastatic cervical lymph nodes. Level Ib had
to be included in the CTV-H for patients who had metastatic lymph nodes at level IIa and any lymph node drainage pathways that contained metastatic lymph nodes. A
minimum of 5 mm around the GTV-P and 3 mm around
the GTV-LN and CTVs were required in all directions to
define each respective planning (P-) target volume
(P-GTV-P, P-GTV-N, P-CTV-H, and P-CTV-L).
In 3D-CRT, P-GTVs and P-CTV-H received radiation doses of 70 grays (Gy) in 35 fractions and 60 Gy in
30 fractions, respectively. Because of the shortage of
machine resources, for most patients who received IMRT,
a simplified IMRT technique was used to shorten the
radiation time in each fraction, with prescription doses of
70 Gy, 68.25 or 66.50 Gy, and 61.25 Gy (in 35 fractions)
for the P-GTV-P, P-GTV-N, and P-CTV-H, respectively. The low neck or supraclavicular field (P-CTV-L)
was treated with anteroposterior=posteroanterior fields
and received 30 fractions at 1.8 Gy per fraction for a total
of 54 Gy. Radiotherapy was delivered once daily in 5 fractions per week over 7 weeks. Some patients received boost
irradiation doses of 4 to 6 Gy in 2 or 3 fractions to
the residual focus in the nasopharynx or the neck.

Pretreatment Evaluation

Chemotherapy

A biopsy from the primary site was required in all patients
for pathologic diagnosis. Pretreatment staging evaluations
included clinical examination of the head and neck, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head and
neck, a computed tomography scan of the thorax, a
whole-body bone scan, abdominal sonography, a complete blood count, and a serum biochemical profile.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the TPF regimen before
radiotherapy included docetaxel 75 mg=m2 on day 1, cisplatin 75 mg=m2 on day 1, and 5-FU 2500 mg=m2 as an
intravenous infusion over 120 hours every 3 weeks for 3
cycles. Dose modifications were based on the preceding
cycle nadir blood counts and interim toxic effects. A reduction in the docetaxel dose by 20% with constant cisplatin
and 5-FU doses was allowed if a grade 4 hematologic
adverse event or febrile neutropenia emerged in the previous course, and 5-FU was stopped if grade >3 mucositis
or diarrhea occurred in the former course. Recombinant
granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support

was permitted for prophylaxis, and antibiotic therapy was
used when patients had grade 4 neutropenia.
Concurrent chemoradiation consisted of weekly cisplatin (40 mg=m2) during radiotherapy for a maximum
of 7 cycles, beginning on the first day of radiotherapy as
planned. Chemotherapy at the full dose would be delivered strictly according to the treatment protocol, and no
adjustment would be allowed under any situation. The
start of chemotherapy could be postponed if the neutrophil count dropped to <2000=lL or the platelet count
was <100,000=lL. Chemotherapy could be suspended if
the creatinine clearance rate became <50 mL per minute.
Follow-Up

After the completion of concurrent chemoradiation, all
patients were assessed every 3 months during the first 3
years, every 6 months for the next 2 years, and annually
thereafter. All local recurrences were diagnosed with nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy and an MRI of the head and
neck. Regional recurrences were diagnosed by clinical examination of the neck and, in doubtful cases, with fineneedle aspiration or an MRI scan of the neck. Distant metastases were diagnosed by clinical symptoms, physical
examinations, and imaging methods. Whenever necessary
and possible, salvage treatments, including reirradiation,
chemotherapy, and surgery, were provided to patients
who developed recurrent disease.
Statistical Analysis

The main objective of both trials was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the
TPF regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiation for
stage III and stage IVA=IVB NPC. The primary endpoints for both trials were overall survival (OS); and the
secondary endpoints were disease progression-free survival
(PFS), local progression-free survival (LPFS), regional
progression-free survival (RPFS), and distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS).
The OS rates at 5 years for patients with stage III
and stage IVA=IVB NPC who received concurrent chemoradiation were approximately 65% and 45%, respectively. We projected a 20% OS improvement from 65%
to 85% for patients with stage III disease and from 45%
to 65% for patients with stage IVA=IVB disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the TPF regimen followed
by concurrent chemoradiation. Forty-seven patients were
required for a Type I error rate of .05 (1-sided) with 80%
statistical power to detect an increase of 20% in 5-year OS
for the stage III trial, and 58 patients were required to
achieve the same statistical power for the stage IVA=IVB

trial. After adjusting for a 10% rate of dropout or loss to
follow-up, the stage III NPC trial required 52 patients,
and the stage IVA=IVB NPC trial required 64 patients.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the
patient characteristics. The estimated OS, PFS, LPFS,
RPFS, and DMFS rates were calculated using the KaplanMeier method, and differences between survival curves
were assessed using the log-rank test in both studies. Survival duration was measured from the time of recruitment
until either death or the date of the last follow-up visit for
patients who remained alive.

1 who died from lymph node progression, 3 who died
from distant metastases, 1 who died from nasal bleeding
after reirradiation to the nasopharynx, and 1 who died
from an unrelated concurrent condition.
Treatment compliance and acute toxicity

Overall, the regimen was tolerated. All patients completed
at least 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 103
patients (88.8%) completed 3 planned courses. The
chemotherapy dose was decreased in 35 patients (30.2%)
because of severe adverse events, including 28 patients in
the second course and 7 patients in the third course.
Adverse events were evaluated according to the National
Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (version 3.0; National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, Md).
The most common severe (grade 3-4) hematologic
and nonhematologic adverse events were neutropenia (64
patients; 55.2%) and nausea=vomiting (23 patients;
19.8%). Seventeen patients (14.7%) developed febrile
neutropenia. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events that resulted
from neoadjuvant chemotherapy are listed in Table 4. No
grade 5 toxicity occurred.

lymph node disease in the neck. All patients received a
median of 5 courses of concurrent chemotherapy (range,
1-7 courses). In total, 77 patients (66.4%) completed at
least 5 courses of concurrent chemotherapy, and 100
patients (86.2%) completed 4 courses. All patients experienced some degree of acute toxicity during concurrent
chemoradiation (Table 4).

December 1, 2013

After a median follow-up of 32.9 months, 38 patients
(32.78%) and 10 patients (8.6%) developed grade 2 and
3 xerostomia, respectively. Grade 2 and 3 hearing loss
occurred in 7 patients (6%) and 2 patients (1.7%), respectively. One patient developed temporal lobe necrosis 4.5
years after the completion of radiotherapy. One patient
had necrosis of the nasopharynx after reirradation to the
nasopharynx because of local recurrence. There were no
cases of radiation-induced cranial nerve palsy, trimus,
osteonecrosis, myelopathy, or overt pituitary damage.
DISCUSSION
The primary objective of the 2 phase 2 trials we are reporting here addressed the efficacy of induction docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU (the TPF regimen) used with a standard
chemoradiation regimen for stage III and stage IVA=IVB
NPC. In particular, we focused on OS as the primary endpoint for patients who received the triple combination of
TPF followed by concurrent chemoradiation. The results
demonstrated a significant improvement in OS to 94.8%
for patients with stage III NPC and to 90.2% for patients
with nonmetastatic stage IV NPC after 3 years of followup. Furthermore, the triple combination of TPF was well
tolerated when used before the standard chemoradiation
strategy for NPC.
NPC is sensitive to both radiation and chemotherapy, and combined chemoradiation is the mainstay of
treatment for advanced, nonmetastatic disease. The use of
chemotherapy with radiation has been studied extensively.
The results from several randomized phase 3 trials and
meta-analyses have confirmed that adjuvant chemotherapy provides no significant improvement in patients’ survival.13-16 Induction cisplatin chemotherapy, when used
before radiation alone, does improve local control and
disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced
NPC without affecting OS.17-20 The receipt of radiation
therapy and concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy
with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, became the
standard treatment of choice for T3 of T4 and=or N1
NPC after the publication of the pivotal Intergroup
INT-0099 study1 and several confirming randomized

trials.2-6 However, adjuvant chemotherapy is poorly tolerated and has limited compliance. because patients suffer
substantial toxicities from concurrent chemoradiation,
and many are unfit and=or reluctant to receive further
chemotherapy. Typically, only 60% of patients (range,
55%-76%) receive all 3 scheduled cycles of adjuvant
chemotherapy, and 70% (range, 60%-81%) receive at
least 2 cycles. The reported studies clearly illustrate that,
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tolerance and compliance indeed are substantially better, and nearly 100% of
patients (range, 97%-100%) can tolerate at least 2
cycles.20
However, it has been suggested that the improvement in OS from concurrent chemotherapy is mostly
because of the improvement in local disease control.21 On
the basis of the published literature, the 5-year OS rates
for patients with stage III and nonmetastatic stage IV
NPC are approximately 65% and 45%, respectively. To
further improve the outcome of patients with locally
advanced NPC, an improvement in both local and distant
control will be needed. However, induction chemotherapy using cisplatin or its combination, such as combined
cisplatin, epirubicin, and paclitaxel, or adjuvant chemotherapy using cisplatin plus 5-FU failed to improve OS
further according to the results from several randomized
clinical trials.13,20,22
Docetaxel has demonstrated significant efficacy as a
single agent or in combination with platinum in HNSCC.
Compared with paclitaxel, it has less neurotoxicity, which
supports its combined use with cisplatin. Its efficacy in the
treatment of HNSCC, excluding NPC, has been demonstrated repeatedly in randomized clinical trials. The results
from the TAX 3238 and TAX 3249 studies revealed that,
when used with concurrent chemoradiation or radiation
alone, the addition of docetaxel (T) to cisplatin and 5-FU
(PF) (ie, TPF vs PF) reduced the risk of death by nearly
30%.
The effect of docetaxel used with cisplatin and without 5-FU (the TP regimen) for NPC has been addressed
in 2 previously reported studies.23,24 A randomized phase
2 trial published in 2009 studied the toxicities and the primary outcome of patients with NPC who did or did not
receive induction chemotherapy using the TP regimen
followed by concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy and conventional radiation. In addition to the acceptable adverseeffect profile, the researchers demonstrated a significant
improvement in OS for patients who received induction
TP chemotherapy. The 3-year OS rate was 94.1% after
induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation,
compared with 65% after chemoradiation alone.23 This
4116

superb and exciting result was consistent with that
reported in a more recently published, retrospective study:
Ekenel et al24 reported their observation of 59 patients
with NPC who received 3 cycles of induction cisplatin
(75 mg=m2) and docetaxel (75 mg=m2) followed by combined cisplatin-based chemotherapy and conventional
radiotherapy using cobolt-60 or a 4 to 6 megavolt linear
accelerator. Impressive OS and PFS rates of 94.9% and
84.7%, respectively, were reported. In both studies, however, the numbers of patients in either stage were limited,
especially those with stage IVA=IVB disease, who are at
substantial risk for local and distant recurrence.
The findings from our trials confirm the encouraging
results mentioned above and suggest that superior results are
achieved in patients who receive TPF-based induction
chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and
3D-CRT or IMRT; ie, the current standard radiation technique. The local control rate in both studies reached >93%,
including patients who were treated for T4 tumors. More
important, the outcomes—especially OS and DMFS—after
such treatment in patients with T4 and=or N3 disease are
nearly identical to those observed in patients with stage III
NPC. The OS and DFMS rates of approximately 90% in
both stages indicate that TPF may substantially improve the
control of systemic disease in patients with advanced NPC.
The already initiated Radiotherapy Oncology Group for
Head and Neck (GORTEC) multicenter phase 3 trial, in
which patients are randomized to receive cisplatin plus radiation with or without neoadjuvant TPF chemotherapy (ie,
TPF!concurrent cisplatin 1 RT vs cisplatin 1 RT), will
confirm the efficacy of neoadjuvant TPF in a randomized
fashion25 (registered online: http:==www.clinicaltrials.gov=NCT00828386). However, that trial does not require
IMRT, which is considered the current standard radiation
technique for the treatment of NPC. Another ongoing
randomized trial in collaboration with our institution will
address the efficacy of neoadjuvant TPF (ie, TPF ! concurrent cisplatin 1 IMRT vs cisplatin 1 IMRT) in patients
with NPC who receive IMRT26 (registered online: http:==
www.clinicaltrials.gov=NCT01245959).
It has been reported that TPF induces a high rate of
severe neutropenia (range, 76%-97%). In our studies,
neutropenia occurred in 55.2% patients, which is less
than the incidence of neutropenia reportedly caused by
G-CSF support. However, the compliance with TPF neoadjuvant chemotherapy was better, all patients tolerated at
least 2 cycles, and 88.8% of patients completed 3 cycles.
In a recently published, large, retrospective series of
370 patients, Lin et al demonstrated that OS after induction chemotherapy with TP or PF followed by IMRT

without concurrent chemotherapy was as good as concurrent chemotherapy.27 If the hypothesis that neoadjuvant
TPF significantly improves distant and local control is
confirmed by the 2 ongoing randomized trials described
above,25,26 then, based on the finding that IMRT
improves the local control rate to >95% for all tumor
classifications, whether concurrent chemotherapy (ie, the
current standard) remains necessary becomes a question.
This question (ie, TPF!concurrent cisplatin 1 IMRT vs
TPF!IMRT) will be addressed further by a multiinstitutional, randomized, noninferiority study that is in
the planning stage; however, the initiation of that trial will
depend on the results from the 2 ongoing randomized trials described above.25,26
Conclusions

The results of our phase 2 trials have demonstrated that
neoadjuvant TPF chemotherapy produces encouraging
and potentially efficacious outcomes in terms of OS, PFS,
and local control in patients with locoregionally advanced
NPC. Furthermore, this regimen was well tolerated and
had a manageable toxicity profile. However, this aggressive treatment combination remains investigational and
can only be considered standard after confirmation by the
already initiated phase 3 randomized trial.
