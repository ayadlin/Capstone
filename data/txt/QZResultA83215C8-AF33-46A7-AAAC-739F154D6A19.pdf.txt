BACKGROUND: This single-center retrospective study determined the efficacy of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (BTD) as induction for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who were eligible for autologous stem cell
transplantation (ASCT). METHODS: Patients with symptomatic MM who had received BTD induction before stem cell
collection at Winship Cancer Institute were included. BTD induction comprised up to 8 3-week cycles of bortezomib
1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; thalidomide 100 mg daily; and dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1 through 4 and
Days 9 through 12. Stem cell mobilization involved granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor and/or cyclophosphamide.
Response was assessed according to European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria. RESULTS:
Review of medical records identified 44 eligible patients (34 patients who were treated in the front-line setting and
10 patients who were treated for recurrent disease) who received a median of 4 BTD cycles. The overall response
rate (ORR) was 91%, which included a greater than or equal to very good partial response (VGPR) rate of 57%
(including 20% stringent complete responses/complete response [sCR/CR] rate). In front-line patients, the ORR was
94%, which included a 56% VGPR rate (24% sCR/CR). The median CD34-positive stem cell collection was
10.67  106/kg. The ORR after ASCT in 34 patients who were evaluable for response was 100%, including a 76%
VGPR rate (53% sCR/CR). Among all 44 patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 27.4 months. The
median overall survival (OS) was not reached after a median follow-up of 25 months, and the 2-year OS rate was
82%. There were no significant differences in PFS (27.4 months vs 23.5 months) or in 2-year survival (80% vs 90%)
between patients who did and did not undergo ASCT, respectively. Twenty patients (45%) developed neuropathy,
including 4 (9%) with grade 3 neuropathy episodes, and 1 patient developed deep vein thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS:
BTD was highly effective and well tolerated as induction for MM patients who were eligible for ASCT. Long-term outC 2010 American Cancer

high-dose therapy (HDT) plus autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT),3,7 which translate into very high overall
response and CR/very good partial response (VGPR) rates
after transplantation. This is important, because achieving
greater than a VGPR both postinduction and post-transplantation is associated with prolonged progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with
MM8; therefore, the use of bortezomib-based induction
regimens may result in improved outcomes.
Preclinical data indicated the synergistic activity of
bortezomib and thalidomide,9 and several studies have
since investigated bortezomib and thalidomide combination regimens. Bortezomib plus thalidomide has demonstrated substantial activity in the frontline setting,10,11
and the triplet combination of bortezomib, thalidomide,
and dexamethasone (BTD) has demonstrated notable
activity in the setting of recurrent disease.12 BTD is currently being investigated in the frontline setting13-17 and
is recommended as an induction treatment option for
patients with MM who are eligible for HDT-ASCT
according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.18 Here,
we report the results of a retrospective, single-center, caseseries analysis evaluating BTD as induction therapy before
ASCT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This was a retrospective analysis of all patients with symptomatic MM who received BTD as induction before stem
cell mobilization at the Winship Cancer Institute between
January 2005 and December 2007; 1 patient with
advanced renal failure has been described previously.19
Patients with both newly diagnosed and previously treated
MM who were not taking part in a clinical trial were
included, and the medical records of all eligible patients
were reviewed. According to practice guidelines at our
center, patients were not excluded from BTD therapy on
the basis of creatinine clearance rate or dialysis dependence; patients with grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy were offered alternative therapy.
Study Design
A review of medical records indicated that all patients
received up to 8 3-week cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; thalidomide 100 mg daily; and
dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1 through 4 and Days 9
through 12. All patients received aspirin for deep vein

3144

thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and concomitant treatment with antiviral and antibiotic medications. Patients
proceeded to stem cell collection after 3 or 4 cycles based
on response; patients underwent stem cell mobilization
with granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF)
7.5 lg/kg twice daily for 4 days or cyclophosphamide
2 g/m2 to 4 g/m2 at the discretion of the treating physician. After stem cell mobilization and harvesting, patients
proceeded to HDT-ASCT or maintenance therapy with
thalidomide at the physician’s discretion. Patients who
proceeded to HDT-ASCT received conditioning with
melphalan 200 mg/m2; those with impaired renal function received melphalan 140 mg/m2.

Assessments
Study objectives were to assess response rates after BTD
induction and post-ASCT, to assess PFS and OS, and to
assess the tolerability of BTD induction. In accordance
with clinical practice at our center, all patients were
assessed for response and progression according to European Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria20 every 3 weeks (once per cycle) during BTD therapy
and every 2 to 3 months thereafter; patients who proceeded to HDT-ASCT were assessed at 30 days and 100
days after transplantation and every 3 months thereafter.
In addition to EBMT criteria, a VGPR was defined as a
90% reduction in serum or urine M-protein according to
International Uniform criteria,21 and serum free-light
chain data also were reviewed when available. Patient
records were reviewed, and all toxicities were graded
according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.

Statistical Analysis
Response rates to BTD were determined in all patients, in
newly diagnosed patients, in patients with elevated (ie,
greater than the median) b2-microglobulin, and in
patients with high-risk cytogenetics. Patients with cytogenetic abnormalities, which were defined as abnormal conventional cytogenetics in at least 2 metaphases, were
considered high risk. Response rates also were determined
after ASCT. PFS and OS were evaluated in all patients
with the Kaplan-Meier method using SPSS software. PFS
and OS also were determined according to transplantation status and cytogenetic risk profile in patients who
proceeded to HDT-ASCT. Patients were not censored for
HDT-ASCT in analyses of PFS.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
An analysis of patient records identified 44 patients with
MM who were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective
analysis; 3 patients presented with plasma cell leukemia
(PCL), 2 at presentation and 1 after receiving lenalidomide
(Revlimid; Celgene Corporation) plus high-dose dexamethasone. Patient demographics and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Thirty-four patients
received BTD as frontline therapy. Eight patients received
BTD as second-line therapy; their prior therapies included
vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD)
(n ¼ 1 patient who had progressive disease [PD]), bortezomib (n ¼ 2 patients who had PD), thalidomide plus dexamethasone (n ¼ 3 patients; 2 who achieved less than a
partial response [PR] and 1 who had PD), and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (n ¼ 2 patients who had PD).
Two patients received BTD as third-line therapy after bortezomib and bortezomib plus dexamethasone (1 patient
achieved less than a PR and 1 patient had PD). The median
duration of BTD therapy was 4 cycles (range, 2-8 cycles).
Nine patients, including all 3 patients who had PCL, had
abnormal cytogenetics: One patient had deletion of chromosome 13 (del13), 2 patients had hypodiploidy with
del13 (including 1 patient with PCL), 3 patients had hypodiploidy without del13 (including 2 patients with PCL),
and 3 patients had hyperdiploidy.
Response to Induction Therapy
The response rate to BTD induction was 91% (40 of 44
patients), including a 9% stringent CR (sCR) rate, an 11%
CR rate (20% sCR/CR rate), and a 36% VGPR rate, for a
VGPR rate of 57%. Table 2 summarizes the responses in
all patients, in patients excluding those with PCL (n ¼ 41),
in frontline patients (n ¼ 34), in patients with elevated b2microglobulin (>3.4 mg/L; n ¼ 21), and in patients with
high-risk cytogenetics (n ¼ 9). Of the 3 patients with PCL,
1 achieved a PR, and 2 proceeded to salvage therapy with
combined bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone
plus cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (VTD-PACE) chemotherapy.
Stem Cell Collection and ASCT
In accordance with the selection criteria for this retrospective analysis, all 44 patients underwent stem cell
mobilization after a median of 4 cycles of BTD. In total,
28 patients received G-CSF alone, 3 patients received
G-CSF followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide
salvage, and 11 patients received planned mobilization

with high-dose cyclophosphamide alone. The remaining
2 patients (both with PCL) underwent mobilization after
progression on BTD and after subsequent therapy with
VTD-PACE. The overall median collection of CD34positive stem cells was 10.67  106/kg (range, 3.49130.56  106/kg).
In total, 34 patients proceeded to HDT-ASCT,
and 3 of those patients received reduced-dose melphalan
(140 mg/m2) because of impaired renal function. The
median time from the start of BTD induction
therapy to ASCT was 4.4 months (133 days). All
patients who proceeded to ASCT were evaluable for
response. The overall response rate post-ASCT was
100%, including a 53% sCR/CR rate (32% sCR) and a
24% VGPR rate, for a VGPR rate of 76%; Table 3
shows the changes in response status from pretransplantation to post-ASCT. Reasons for not proceeding to
ASCT included PD in 2 patients with PCL, peripheral
neuropathy in 2 patients, and physician/patient choice
for the other 6 patients; 3 patients received thalidomide
100 mg daily as maintenance therapy. Of the 10 patients
who did not proceed to ASCT, 4 patients achieved a
CR, 4 patients achieved a VGPR, and 2 patients had PD
with BTD induction.
Time-to-Events Data
Among all 44 patients, the median PFS from initiation of
BTD induction was 27.4 months. The median OS from

initiation of BTD induction had not been reached after a
median follow-up of 25 months, and the estimated 1-year
and 2-year OS rates were 95% and 82%, respectively. An
analysis of time-to-events data according to transplantation status revealed no differences in PFS or OS between
patients who underwent ASCT (n ¼ 34) and patients who
did not undergo ASCT (n ¼ 10) (Fig. 1). The median
PFS was 27.4 months in the ASCT group and 23.5
months in the non-ASCT group (P ¼ .945; Kaplan-Meier
estimate). In the ASCT group, the post-transplantation 1year survival rate was 97% (1 transplantation-related mortality was reported after the patient underwent a second
ASCT), and the 2-year survival rate was 80%. In patients
who did not proceed to ASCT, the 1-year and 2-year sur-

3146

vival rates were both 90%. The median PFS was 14.7
months in patients with high-risk cytogenetics versus 28
months in patients with low-risk cytogenetics (Fig. 2). After ASCT, an analysis of OS according to whether patients
achieved a CR/VGPR with BTD induction suggested a
trend toward improved survival in patients who achieved
at least a VGPR with BTD induction therapy (P ¼ .36)
(Fig. 3).
Safety
A comprehensive summary of all adverse events is provided in Table 4. Twenty-four patients (55%) developed
neuropathy during BTD induction therapy, including 20
patients with grade 1/2 neuropathy and 4 patients (9%)
with grade 3 neuropathy. Two patients (5%) developed
DVT, and 2 patients (5%) developed herpes zoster. No
major bleeding episodes occurred.

DISCUSSION
The findings of this retrospective case-series analysis demonstrate that BTD is highly effective as induction therapy,
with 57% of patients achieving a VGPR. It is noteworthy that BTD induction therapy resulted in very high
response rates in previously untreated patients with MM
(94% overall, including a 56% VGPR rate). Furthermore, the adverse prognostic factors of elevated b2-microglobulin and high-risk cytogenetics appeared to have no
substantial effects on the response to BTD induction;
however, the effects of high-risk cytogenetics should be

interpreted with caution because of the small number of
patients in this group. This substantial activity translated
into high response rates after ASCT, with all evaluable
patients responding, including 53% who achieved a sCR/
CR and 76% who achieved a VGPR. Such high CR and
VGPR rates are important, because it has been demonstrated that CR rates and a VGPR rates, both postinduction and post-ASCT, are prognostic for improved
outcomes.8,22-27
To date, this is the largest study, with the longest follow-up, to assess BTD induction therapy. The 25-month
follow-up allowed an analysis of post-ASCT outcomes to
assess the impact of the response and CR rates achieved;
and, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report
time-to-events data after BTD induction. Reflecting the
association between CR and VGPR rates and improved
outcomes,8,22-27 the time-to-events data were promising.

to response to BTD induction therapy suggested a trend
toward improved survival in patients who achieved a
VGPR compared with those who did not, although the
small number of patients who did not proceed to HDTASCT limits interpretation of this result. It is noteworthy
that PFS and OS appeared to be the same in patients who
did and those who did not proceed to HDT-ASCT, suggesting that BTD may obviate the need for HDT-ASCT
in some patients. Together with reports that BTD provides further cytoreduction when administered as maintenance post-ASCT,28 these data add to the debate
regarding the use of HDT-ASCT in the era of novel
agent-based therapies.3,29 However, in the current study,
further follow-up is needed to assess the long-term outcomes of patients who underwent HDT-ASCT or
received maintenance therapy; it is important to note that,
because of the retrospective nature of our study, data on
minimal residual disease (MRD) status by flow cytometry
or PCR were not available for patients who achieved a
CR. The use of HDT-ASCT as consolidation for patients
who achieve a CR with BTD but remain MRD-positive
could result in a further improvement in the depth of

3148

response, and it has been demonstrated that MRD status
can further stratify outcomes in patients who achieve a
CR according to EBMT criteria.30-32 Despite the small
number of patients in our series with high-risk cytogenetics (n ¼ 9) among those who proceeded to ASCT, PFS
and OS appeared shorter in patients who had high-risk cytogenetics compared with those who had low-risk cytogenetics. On the basis of results produced with other
thalidomide-containing regimens in patients with highrisk cytogenetics,33,34 it is possible, and represents a testable hypothesis, that patients with high-risk cytogenetics
may have benefited from a longer duration of BTD therapy either before ASCT13 or as maintenance or consolidation therapy once they were in remission.
The efficacy data reported here are similar to those
reported in other studies of BTD induction therapy for
patients with MM.13-15,17,35 It is noteworthy that our
results are very similar to interim data from a phase 3
study by the Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), which compared BTD with thalidomide plus dexamethasone as induction therapy in newly
diagnosed patients,13 supporting the validity of the

findings from our retrospective analysis. In the GIMEMA
phase 3 study, BTD produced significantly higher
response rates than thalidomide plus dexamethasone both
postinduction (94% overall, including a 62% VGPR
rate and a 32% CR/near-CR rate, vs 79% overall, including a 29% VGPR rate and a 12% CR/near-CR rate)
and post-transplantation (a 76% VGPR rate, including
a 55% CR/near-CR rate, vs a 58% VGPR rate, including a 32% CR/near-CR rate).13 These results for BTD
and the response rates observed in our analysis similarly
appear greater than those reported with thalidomide plus
dexamethasone in 2 phase 3 studies in frontline MM.5,6
Furthermore, the response rates reported with BTD in the
current analysis and in the GIMEMA phase 3 study also
appear to compare favorably with those reported for bortezomib plus dexamethasone36-39; for example, in the
French Myeloma Intergroup (IFM) phase 3 study of bortezomib plus dexamethasone versus VAD as induction
therapy, the response rate to bortezomib plus dexamethasone induction was 82%, including a 39% VGPR rate
and a 15% CR/near-CR rate, with 68% achieving a
VGPR after transplantation, including a 39% CR/nearCR rate38 (updated data presented at the American Society of Hematology [ASH]/American Society of Clinical

The approach of combining bortezomib with an
immunomodulatory drug and dexamethasone as induction therapy in newly diagnosed patients with MM also
has been demonstrated in 2 studies of the combination of
bortezomib, the thalidomide analog lenalidomide, and
dexamethasone.40,41 Preliminary results from a phase 1/2
study indicate highly promising activity with this combination, which produced a 100% overall response rate,
including a 75% VGPR rate and a 40% CR/near-CR
rate.40
BTD is associated with rapid responses. In the current analysis, patients received a median of only 4 3-week
cycles; in other studies, similarly high response rates were
observed with even shorter durations of BTD therapy.13,35 The abbreviated number of cycles needed to
achieve such high response rates likely contributes to the
generally good tolerability of the BTD regimen. In particular, the short duration of therapy may minimize cumulative peripheral neuropathy arising from treatment. Both
bortezomib42,43 and thalidomide44-46 are associated with
peripheral neuropathy, so a possible increase in the inci-

dence of peripheral neuropathy when these agents are
combined was a concern with BTD therapy. However,
the 45% rate of neuropathy reported in our analysis
appears similar to that reported with bortezomib plus
melphalan and prednisone in previously untreated
patients in the VISTA phase 3 study (44%)4 and with single-agent bortezomib in the Assessment of Proteasome
Inhibition on Extending Remissions (APEX) phase 3
study (37%)43; the 9% rate of grade 3 events also appears
similar to the rates reported in VISTA (13%)4 and APEX
(9%),43 in the GIMEMA phase 3 study of BTD (9%),13
in the IFM phase 3 study of bortezomib plus dexamethasone (7%),38 and in phase 3 studies of thalidomide plus
dexamethasone (3%-7%).5,6 Together, these data suggest
that the combination of bortezomib and thalidomide in
the BTD regimen does not appear to result in additive peripheral neuropathy.
Also noteworthy was the low rate of DVT observed
with BTD induction in the current analysis (2%), which,
even allowing for the fact that all patients received aspirin
prophylaxis, is markedly less than the DVT rates reported
in studies of thalidomide plus dexamethasone, a regimen
that is associated with an elevated rate of thromboembolic
events.5,6,47 This difference is supported by preliminary
data from the GIMEMA phase 3 study of BTD versus
thalidomide plus dexamethasone, which demonstrated a
significantly lower rate of DVT with BTD (3.9% vs
5.5%; P ¼ .01) although all patients received prophylaxis.13 These findings, together with the low rates of
DVT reported from studies of bortezomib in combination with regimens of known thrombogenic potential,
suggest that the addition of bortezomib may mitigate such
thrombogenic potential.48
In conclusion, BTD is highly active and well tolerated as induction therapy before ASCT in patients with
MM. This translates into very high response rates, very
high rates of VGPR after transplantation, and, as
reported here for the first time, promising long-term outcomes after BTD induction. In addition, in this retrospective analysis, there was no notable difference in PFS or OS
between the ASCT and non-ASCT groups, which suggests that BTD may obviate the need for ASCT in certain
patients, although further follow-up would be needed to
confirm this possibility. The final results from the
GIMEMA phase 3 study of BTD versus thalidomide plus
dexamethasone13 likely will provide confirmatory evidence of the impressive efficacy of the BTD regimen in
previously untreated patients with MM.
