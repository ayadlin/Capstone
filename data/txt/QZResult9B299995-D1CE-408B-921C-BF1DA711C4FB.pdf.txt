ABSTRACT
Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(EGFR-TKIs) is a major challenge to targeted therapy for non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). We investigated whether a cyclin D kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, PD
0332991, could reverse EGFR-TKI resistance in human lung cancer cells and explored
the underlying mechanisms. We found that PD 0332991 potentiated gefitinib-induced
growth inhibition in both EGFR-TKI-sensitive (PC-9) and EGFR-TKI-resistant (PC-9/
AB2) cells by down-regulating proliferation and inducing apoptosis and G0/G1 cell
cycle arrest. Tumor xenografts were then used to verify the effects of PD 0332991
in vivo. Mice treated with a combination of PD 0332991 and gefitinib had the fastest
tumor regression and delayed relapse. Tumors from mice receiving the combination
treatment exhibited down-regulated proliferation, up-regulated apoptosis, and less
angiogenesis. Finally, lung adenocarcinoma patients with acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs were given an exploratory treatment of PD 0332991. One patient with
gefitinib resistance exhibited clinical remission after treatment with PD 0332991.
These findings suggest PD 0332991 reverses acquired EGFR-TKI-resistance in NSCLC
cells, and may provide a novel treatment strategy for NSLSC patients with EGFR-TKI
resistance.

in Caucasian patients. Adenocarcinoma patients with an
EGFR mutation have a longer progression-free survival
after treatment with the EGFR-TKI, gefitinib, as compared
to standard chemotherapy [5, 6], making targeted therapy
a hallmark of lung cancer treatment. Unfortunately, despite
the success of EGFR-TKIs (such as gefitinib and erlotinib)
in NSCLC patients, almost all cases eventually re-progress
after a median of 10 months from the onset of treatment.
Even the patients who initially exhibit a dramatic response
will become resistant to EGFR-TKI treatment [2, 7–9].
Currently, this acquired resistance is the greatest challenge
for EGFR-TKI treatment of lung cancer.
The mechanism of EGFR-TKI acquired resistance
is likely multifactorial, but is not fully understood. For

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancerrelated mortality in the world [1], and non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all
lung cancers [2]. Chemotherapy has traditionally played
a central role in the treatment of patients with advanced
NSCLC. However, the 5-year survival rate (less than 10%)
is still very poor [3]. With the emergence of epidermal
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFRTKIs), the prognosis of adenocarcinoma patients with
specific EGFR mutations has significantly improved
[4]. Interestingly, EGFR mutations are more common
in Asian female patients without a smoking history than

40-50% of resistant lung cancers, the acquisition of a
second mutation in EGFR, for example, the substitution
of threonine with methionine at amino acid 790
(T790M) in exon 20, is a well-established mechanism
[10, 11]. In addition, other mechanisms include HER2
amplification [12, 13], MET amplification [14, 15],
PIK3CA mutations [16, 17], BRAF mutation [18], NF1
loss [19] and the activation of alternative signaling
pathways [20]. Histologic changes, such as small
cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation or epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT) have also been reported
[21]. Despite the progress of mechanistic studies and
emerging novel drugs, drug resistance is still a problem.
The 3rd generation EGFR-TKI, AZD9291, is regarded
as a breakthrough in the treatment of gefitinib- or
erlotinib-resistant lung cancers. AZD9291 is an oral,
irreversible, EGFR mutant-selective EGFR-TKI, which
not only targets sensitive tumors (like L858R or exon
19 deletion) but also tumors with resistant T790M
mutations [8]. Moreover, since other genes or signaling
pathways are abnormally activated in TKI-resistant
tumors, those targets are also exploited in the treatment
of TKI resistance, although most of the drugs are still in
preclinical or clinical trials [22]. However, all of these
treatments still eventually lose efficacy and the disease
progresses once again. Therefore, it is vital to find a
solution to irreversibly treat TKI resistance.
Most cancer cells are killed after exposure to
anticancer drugs. However, a small proportion of cells
survives, escapes from the cell cycle, and enters into
a quiescent stage (G0). In certain circumstances, the
quiescent cancer cells will return into the cell cycle
again from the G0 phase. This is called the “re-entry cell
cycle” theory, which may also be applied as a theoretical
mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
Under this model, gefitinib or erotinib can kill most of
the lung cancer cells harboring EGFR mutations, but the
remaining cells are forced into G0 phase and escape from
TKI damage. The exposure to EGFR-TKIs may block
the EGFR pathway and force the tumor cells to acquire
abnormal mutations or activation of oncogenes and/or
alternative signaling pathways, resulting in tumor cell
proliferation.
Therefore, in view of this theory, we propose that
targeting the cell cycle might be a feasible method to
reverse EGFR-TKI resistance. This treatment method
can circumvent all the abnormally activated oncogenes
or pathways and directly inhibit downstream factors,
such as cell cycle-related proteins. In order to test our
hypothesis, we conducted studies using PD 0332991,
which is an orally active small molecule that potently
and specifically inhibits cyclin D kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6)
in a reversible manner. In preclinical studies and clinical
trials, PD 0332991 had synergistic anti-tumor effects
in combination with other drugs in breast carcinoma,
multiple myeloma, and other tumors [25–29]. However,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PD 0332991 has not been tested in EGFR-TKI-resistant
lung cancers. Therefore, the purpose of present study
was to investigate whether PD 0332991 can reverse
EGFR-TKI-resistance in human lung cancer cells
in vitro and in vivo, and to explore the underlying
mechanisms.

RESULTS
PD 0332991 potentiated the growth inhibitory
effect of gefitinib in both gefitinib-sensitive and
resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines
After exposure to gefitinib for 24 hr, PC-9 cells
remained sensitive to treatment with an IC50 of 34.41
μmol/L, while PC-9/AB2 cells were less sensitive with an
IC50 of 211.22 μmol/L (Figure 1A). PD 0332991 alone
had no effect on cell viability (IC50 = 26.24 μmol/L for
PC-9; IC50 = 33.35 μmol/L for PC-9/AB2; Figure 1B),
although there may be other effects that were not tested.
We next examined whether there was a synergistic effect
of gefitinib and PD 0332991 on the viability of PC-9 and
PC-9/AB2 cells (Supplementary Figure S1). As shown
in Figure 1C, PD 0332991 at 8 μmol/L concentration
potentiated the inhibitory effect of gefitinib at 16 μmol/L
on PC-9 cells. Gefitinib at 16 μmol/L had no effect on
PC-9/AB2 cell viability; however, the combination of PD
0332991 at 8 μmol/L and gefitinib at 16 μmol/L inhibited
the growth of PC-9/AB2 cells (Figure 1D), suggesting
that PD 0332991 has the potential to reverse EGFR-TKI
resistance in NSCLC cells. Since PD 0332991 at 8 μmol/L
and gefitinib at 16 μmol/L had a synergistic effect on the
viability of PC-9/AB2 cells, this combination was used for
subsequent in vitro studies.

PD 0332991 enhanced the gefitinib-induced
inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
G0/G1 phase arrest in lung adenocarcinoma cell
lines
EdU staining was used to determine the effect of PD
0332991 on NSCLC cell proliferation. A single treatment
of PD 0332991 (8 μmol/L) or gefinitib (16 μmol/L)
inhibited PC-9 cell proliferation. The percentage of EdUpositive cells was 10.93% for the PD0332991 group, and
10.34% in the gefitinib group. The combination of PD
0332991 and gefitinib in PC-9 cells reduced EdU staining
to 3.7% of cells. As expected, the gefitinib-resistant PC-9/
AB2 cells were less sensitive to gefinitib (16 μmol/L).
However, the percentage of EdU-positive PC-9/AB2 cells
in the combination treatment group was reduced to 2.1%.
These results indicate that PD 0332991 enhances the antiproliferative effects of gefitinib (Figure 2A).
We next used AnnexinV/7AAD staining to assess
cell apoptosis caused by PD 0332991 treatment. Compared
to PC-9 cells, PC-9/AB2 cells had a much lower response

to PD 0332991 or gefinitib, with an apoptosis rate of only
13.2% for the gefitinib group and almost no effect in the
PD 0332991 group. However, the apoptosis rate of PC-9/
AB2 cells increased to 23.66% with combined treatment
of PD 0332991 and gefitinib. These results demonstrate
that PD 0332991 can enhance gefitnib-induced apoptosis
(Figure 2B).
Finally, we used PI staining to assess cell-cycle
stages. A single treatment of gefitinib led to a 23.67%
increase of G0/G1 arrest in PC-9 cells and a 12.75%
increase in PC-9/AB2 cells. The combination of PD
0332991 and gefitinib led to a 30.6% increase in G0/G1
arrest in PC-9 cells and a 23.75% increase in PC-9/AB2
cells. These results indicate that the combination treatment
of PD 0332991 and gefinitib induced a higher rate of G0/
G1 arrest compared to treatments with PD 0332991 or
gefinitib alone (Figure 2C).

To further explore the mechanism by which PD
0332991 sensitized TKI-resistant PC-9/AB2 cells to
gefitinib, we performed microarray analysis to profile
gene expression in PC-9/AB2 cells treated with PD
0332991 and a combination of PD 0332991 and gefitinib.
There were 421 up-regulated and 1023 down-regulated
genes in the PD 0332991 group (8 μmol/L) cells,
while there were 1512 up-regulated and 1980 downregulated genes in the combination treatment group
(Supplementary Figure S2). We then examined the lists
of genes for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
A number of GO terms were enriched within both the
PD 0332991 treated and the combination treatment PC-9/
AB2 gene lists, including cell cycle checkpoint, G1/S
transition of mitotic cell cycle, regulation of transcription
involved in G1/S phase of mitotic cell cycle, and S

0332991 for 24 hr, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The concentrations of PD 0332991 and gefitinib used in this study were

phase of mitotic cell cycle. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes
and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that
expression of genes in the DNA replication pathway, the
cell cycle pathway, and the cell cycle-yeast pathways
were enriched in both treatment groups (Figure 3A).
To further confirm the microarray data, we performed
real-time PCR for 27 cell cycle-related genes. As shown
in (Figure 3B-3C), the expression of CDK4, CDK6,
CCNB2, CDC7, and CDK2 were all decreased after PD
0332991 treatment.

The RB1 gene was down-regulated in TKI-resistant
PC-9/AB2 cells with combination treatment, therefore we
hypothesized that inhibition of the pRb pathway by PD
0332991 contributes to the anti-cancer effects of gefitinib
in TKI-resistant NSCLC cells. CDK4/6 complexes,
along with CYCLIN D1, induce phosphorylation
and inactivation of pRb, thereby allowing cell cycle

progression. Of the 16 known phosphorylation sites on
pRb, Ser780 and Ser795 are specifically phosphorylated
by CDK4/6. Therefore, phosphorylation of pRb at these
specific sites may be altered by the CDK4/6 inhibitor,
PD 0332991. To test this hypothesis, we determined the
effects of PD 0332991 on pRb and its phosphorylated
state, as well as other cell cycle proteins using real time
PCR and Western blots. There was a decrease in total pRb
and phosphorylated pRb in both EGFR-TKI-sensitive and
resistant NSCLC cells after treatment with PD 0332991
(8 μmol/L) for 24-48 hr (Figure 4A-4D). The expression
of pRb, p-pRb(S780), p-pRb(S795), CDK4, CDK6, and
CYCLIND1 were higher in PC-9/AB2 cells than PC-9
cells (Figure 4E). In addition, PD 0332991 treatment
down-regulated the expression of E2F1, CDK4, CDK6
and CYCLIND1 in both cell lines.
The combination of PD 0332991 (8 μmol/L) and
gefitinib (16 μmol/L) down-regulated phosphorylated

pRb and E2F1 expression compared to either PD
0332991 or gefitinib alone in TKI-resistant PC-9/AB2
cells. Phosphorylated AKT and MAPK expression
were also decreased with the combination treatment,
indicating that AKT and MAPK are involved in the
reversion of EGFR-TKI resistance by PD 0332991
(Figure 4F-4G). Because the effects of PD 0332991
could be the result of toxicity, we performed the
experiments with various concentrations of PD
0332991 in PC-9/AB2 cells, and selected 1 μmol/L as
the combined concentration with gefitnib (16 μmol/L).
At this concentration we did not see any attenuation of
CDK4/6 expression, and only a slightly attenuation of
pRb expression, while P-pRb (S780), P-pRb (S795) and
P-CDK6 (pTyr24) were all decreased (Supplementary
Figure S3A). There were also synergistic effects
with this lower dose as were seen with the other dose
described above (Supplementary Figure S3B)

Combination treatment with PD 0332991 and
gefitinib inhibited the growth and relapse of
human PC-9/AB2 tumor xenografts

0332991 (150 mg/kg) with gefitinib (100 mg/kg) inhibited
tumor growth, showing tumor growth inhibition (168%; p
< 0.001). All of the mice from the combination treatment
group had a tumor volume < 30 mm3 after 14 days of
treatment, and 20% (2/10) of the mice were completely
cured without relapse. Importantly, mice treated with PD
0332991 plus gefitinib exhibited a much slow relapse
pattern and increased survival times compared to gefitinib
treatment alone (P+G 169.7 ± 4.62 days vs G 149.7 ± 6.87
days, p<0.05). Compared to the vehicle group, the PD
0332991 plus gefitinib group had a 40 day longer survival

To further examine whether the combination of
PD 0332991 and gefitinib altered tumor progression and
relapse in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells in vivo, we used
a PC-9/AB2 tumor xenograft mouse model. As shown
in Figure 5A, a single treatment of PD 0332991 had an
inhibitory effect on tumor growth, but the result was not
statistically significant. However, administration of PD

time. No severe side effects were observed in the PD
0332991 and/or gefitinib treatment groups. Interestingly,
the mice treated with gefitinib alone also had inhibition of
tumor growth. We speculate that this may be because the
PC-9/AB2 cells have a different response to gefitinib in
vivo than they do in vitro.
To explore the mechanism underlying tumor
regression, we sacrificed a second set of identically
treated mice on the 10th day after treatment began, and
tumor tissues were embedded and stained with HE, Ki67,
TUNEL, and CD34. HE staining showed that the tumors

from the PD 0332991 plus gefitinib group had more fibers
and fewer blood vessels compared to the other three
groups, indicating that they may have decreased metastatic
capability (Figure 5C). Ki67 immunohistochemistry
(Ki67-IHC) was used to assess cell proliferation. As
shown in Figure 5D-5G, in the vehicle group, there was
45% positive staining, in the PD 0332991 group there
was 21% positive staining, in the gefitinib group there
was 12% positive staining, and the PD 0332991 plus
gefitinib group, there was only 3% positive staining.
These results indicated that PD 0332991 combined with

gefitinib inhibited TKI-resistant cell proliferation in vivo.
With TUNEL staining (Figure 5F-5I), we found that
PD 0332991 plus gefitinib increased apoptosis rates as
compared to other three groups (vehicle group: 5%, PD
0332991 group: 35%, gefitinib group: 45%, combination
group: 67%). Finally, angiogenesis in tumor tissues was
evaluated by CD34 immunohistochemistry (Figure 5E5H). Angiogenesis was less abundant in the PD 0332991
plus gefitinib group compared to the other three groups
(vehicle group: 30%, PD 0332991 group: 21%, gefitinib
group: 18%, combination group: 4%; for CD34 positivity).
These data indicate that the combination of PD 0332991
plus gefitinib induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation
and angiogenesis compared to PD 0332991 or gefitinib
treatment alone in PC-9/AB2 tumor xenografts.

TKI resistance had occurred. The patient was given PD
0332991 (100 mg PO) treatment, while Iressa treatment
continued. Three weeks after PD 0332991 treatment,
MRI examination showed most of the brain metastasis
had disappeared (Figure 6C-6D). Bone pain was also
decreased. The patient is still taking PD 0332991 and
under intensive care and follow-up. Although these
findings are only from one patient, we believe that PD
0332991 may improve metastatic lung cancer patients’
quality of life and there should be further research on PD
0332991 in lung cancer patients.

DISCUSSION
Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality
worldwide [28]. Asian female patients without a history of
smoking are more likely to have EGFR gene mutations in
exon 19 or 21 compared to caucasians [29]. After a good
initial response to EGFR-TKIs, of approximately 9-14
months, most patients will ultimately develop resistance
to EGFR-TKIs. The mechanisms underlying acquired
resistance are unclear. The primary mechanism identified
is a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, which occurs
in ~60% of patients. More recently, an irreversible third
generation EGFR-TKI, AZD9291, has emerged. However,
acquired resistance still occurred despite an impressive
initial response to AZD92921 in EGFR T790M+ patients,
probably due to an additional C797S mutation [8]. Other
mechanisms of resistance include MET amplification,
HER2 amplification, EGFR amplification and PIK3CA
mutations [30]. Once patients appear resistant to
EGFR-TKIs, re-biopsy and gene mutation detection is
necessary. However, there are still many patients with
EGFR-TKI drug resistance who do not have T790M or
other secondary gene mutations. Recent studies have
demonstrated that abnormal activation of alternative
signaling pathways, including MET, ERBB2, AXL, and
MAPK1, contribute to EGFR-TKI resistance [31–34]. It
is important for future studies to investigate whether there
is a common downstream mechanism of these alternative
signaling pathways and secondary gene mutations.
Aberrant cell cycle control is a hallmark of cancer
[35, 36]. Mutation of EGFR leads to the dysregulation of
cell cycle control, ultimately facilitating proliferation that
favoring tumorigenesis. EGFR-TKIs block the improper
activation of the EGFR pathway. However, after a
period of TKI treatment, NSCLC cells can reproduce via
bypassing the EGFR pathway. The cancer cells acquire
resistance to EGFR-TKIs and grow out of control with the
activation of the cell cycle. Therefore, we hypothesize that
cell cycle inhibition might be a good therapeutic target to
reverse TKI resistance.
PD 0332991 is a potent and highly selective
inhibitor of CDK4/6 and CYCLIND1 kinase activity.
CDK4/6 phosphorylates pRb, a tumor suppressor and
one of the most important proteins in the regulation of

Clinical analysis of pRb expression and case
report
We next examined the expression of pRb in tumor
tissues of NSCLC patients. As shown in Figure 6A-6B,
the tumor tissues of NSCLC patients were all in phase
IV, had EGFR mutations, and had high expression of
phosphorylated pRb. The clinical characteristics of
NSCLC patients are shown in Supplementary Table S2.
Patient 2, who had a high p-pRb/pRb score (i.e. low
pRb but extremely high phosphorylated pRb) developed
gefitinib resistance after only 5 months of treatment, which
was much less than the median time of 12 months (8,9,27).
Three other patients with low or median p-pRb/pRb scores
have not yet shown drug resistance after taking gefitinib
for 1 year. However, due to the limited patient samples, it
is impossible to determine whether phosphorylated pRb
expression is correlated with the timing of EGFR-TKI
resistance.
Three additional NSCLC patients who previously
received EGFR-TKIs are receiving PD 0332991 treatment.
Two patients had stable disease and one patient exhibited
a partial response to PD 0332991 treatment. Figure 6
shows the patient, while the treatment pipeline is shown
in Supplementary Table S3. The patient was a 63-year-old
woman who presented with chronic cough for several
months and was admitted in October, 2013. An enhanced
chest computed tomography indicated a solitary mass
in the upper lobe of the right lung. No distal metastasis
was detected and a right upper lobectomy with systemic
lymphadenectomy was performed. The pathological
diagnosis was adenocarcinoma (pT2aN2M0, IIIA).
Four cycles of postoperative chemotherapy were given
with the regimen of pemetrex and cisplatin, followed
by mediastinal radiotherapy of 5000Gy. The patient
had bone and lung metastasis, and started to take Iressa
(250 mg PO daily) and zoledronic acid (0.4 mg) infusion
monthly. The metastatic tumors responded well and
disease was controlled. However, brain metastasis was
found, indicating that the disease had progressed and

the cell cycle and cell proliferation. pRb expression is
low in normal lung tissues, but the positive rate of pRb
expression in NSCLCs is about 43.8% and is associated
with a poor prognosis [37]. pRb forms a complex with
E2F1 which is released upon phosphorylation of pRb, and
is involved in regulating gene transcription and promoting
cell proliferation. Consequently, inhibition of CDK4/6 by
PD 0332991 completely suppresses pRb phosphorylation
and exerts a potent antitumor effect. Previous studies
have demonstrated that PD 0332991 has favorable antiproliferative effects in breast cancer, ovarian cancer,
myeloma, and glioblastoma cells in vitro [38, 39, 40].
In the present study we investigated the effect of PD
0332991 in EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer cells, both
in vitro and in vivo.
We demonstrated that PD 0332991 caused EGFRTKI-resistant NSCLC cells to overcome acquired
resistance. A combination of PD 0332991 (8 μmol/L)

and gefitinib (16 μmol/L) inhibited the viability of both
EGFR-TKI-sensitive PC-9 cells and EGFR-TKI-resistant
PC-9/AB2 cells, by down-regulating proliferation and
inducing cell apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.
Mice treated with PD 0332991 and gefitinib showed the
fastest tumor regression and the slowest relapse pattern.
Tumors from mice treated with the combination showed
down-regulated proliferation, up-regulated apoptosis, and
a reduced angiogenesis. Taken together, our data suggest
that PD 0332991 enhances the effect of gefitinib-induced
cell growth inhibition in both EGFR-TKI-sensitive as well
as EGFR-TKI-resistant cells with no significant toxicity.
One important mechanism of EGFR-TKI acquired
resistance is the activation of other signaling pathways
bypassing EGFR and favoring cell cycle re-progression.
After treatment with gefitinib, EGFR mutant NSCLC cells
are arrested in the G0/G1 phase and become quiescent
[41]. However, when alternative signaling pathways are

activated, the cells in the G0 phase are able to re-enter
the cell cycle and start to proliferate. In the cell cycle, the
restriction point is G1-S phase, which is regulated by the
CDK4/6-pRb pathway. Cyclins and the catalytic CDKs
form active heterodimers to facilitate phosphorylation of
pRb at Ser780 and Ser795 sites. After the NSCLC cells
were treated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, PD 0332991,
CYCLIND1-CDK4/6 complexes could not be formed, and
the downstream target, pRb, could not be phosphorylated
and bind to the E2F1 transcriptional regulator, thus
suppressing target gene transcription [42]. PD 0332991
blocked the CDK4/6-pRb-E2F1 pathway and promoted
the EGFR-TKI-resistant cells to remain in G0 phase,
suppressing growth. In breast cancer, PD 0332991 reduced
tumor cell viability due to the loss of pRb function.
However, we have not found other reports of PD 0332991
treatment in lung cancer.
In tissue samples, expression of phosphorylated
pRb was high in tumors from NSCLC patients with EGFR
mutations. However, due to the limited number of patient
samples, it is difficult at this time to determine whether
phosphorylated pRb expression is correlated with the time
of EGFR-TKI resistance. To further translate our bench
study into the clinic, three NSCLC patients were given
PD 0332991. Two patients achieved stable disease and one
patient had regression for brain metastasis. However, more
patients with EGFR-TKI resistance need to be recruited to
confirm the efficacy and side effects of PD 0332991.
In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time
that the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD 0332991 is a promising
drug in the treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFRTKI drug resistance by blocking pRb-mediated cell cycle
progression. However, further studies are needed to
predict a biomarker for PD 0332991 treatment and verify
the effects of PD 0332991 in NSCLC patients with EGFRTKI resistance. It is also worth investigating whether PD
0332991 can be used to combat resistance to other TKIs in
NSCLC, such as AZD9291 or crizotinib.

(Houston, USA). Gefitinib was dissolved in DMSO and
PC-9/AB2 cells were exposed at a concentration of 0.05
μmol/L.

MTT assay
NSCLC proliferation was examined using a 3-(4, 5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. Cells (180 μl) in the exponential growth
phase (3 × 103 cells/well) were seeded into a 96-well
plates, and 20 μl of gefitinib and/or PD 0332991 were
added. After incubation at 37°C, 20 μl of MTT solution
(5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well, and the plates
were incubated for an additional 4 hr at 37°C. The plates
were centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min, medium was
aspirated from each well, and 180 μl of DMSO was added
to each well to dissolve the formazan. Optical density
was measured at 490 nm with a SoftMax Pro analysis
program interfaced with a SpectraMax M5 Microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Each
experiment was carried out in 6 replicate wells for each
concentration and in 3-4 independent experiments. The
IC50-value was defined as the concentration needed for
a 50% reduction in the absorbance calculated based on
survival curves.

5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining
EdU staining detects the S-phase of the cell cycle
by incorporating the nucleoside analog Uridine into newly
synthesized DNA strands. A Cell-Light™ EdU stain kit
was purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China) and
the staining was performed according the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were cultured with 50 μM EdU
for 2 hr followed by two washes with PBS and fixation
with 4% paraformaldehyde. After penetration by 0.5%
Triton X-100 and washing with PBS, the proliferated
cells were stained and analysis was performed with
fluorescence microscopes using single interference filters
set for red (Apollo), which stained EdU-labeled cells, or
blue (Hoechst 33342), which stained all cell nuclei.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs and cells

Flow cytometry analysis of apoptotic cells

The parental NSCLC cell line, PC-9, and its drugresistant sub-cloned cell line, PC-9/AB2, were provided by
Prof. Zhou from Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai,
China. PC-9 is a gefitinib-sensitive cell line that harbors
a deletion of EGFR exon 19 (E746-A750del). PC-9/AB2
cells were established by long-term exposure of PC-9 cells
to gefitinib and is resistant to gefitinib [23]. PC-9 cells
were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island,
NY) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO-BRL, Grand
Island, NY), in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at
37°C. Gefitinib, (N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl) -7-methoxy
-6-[3-(morpholin-4-yl) propoxy] quinazolin-4-amine) and
PD 0332991were purchased from Selleck Chemicals, LLC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well
plates and cultured for 24 hr. Gefitinib and/or PD 0332991
were added at various concentrations and cells were
cultured for another 24 hr. Cells were stained using an
Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Analysis Kit (BD Bioscience,
CA, USA) and analyzed with a FACSAria™ flow
cytometer (BD Bioscience, CA, USA).

Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle
To determine the effects of gefitinib and/or PD
0332991 on cell cycle, 1.5 × 105 cells/well were seeded
in 6-well plates and incubated for 12 h. Cells were

synchronized by starving them in serum-free DMEM for
24 h. Cells were then incubated with or without gefitinib
and/or PD 0332991 for 24 h, trypsinized, and fixed in
70% ice-cold ethanol overnight. Cells were then treated
with DNase-free ribonuclease (TAKARA, Shiga, Japan),
stained with propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma–Aldrich, MO,
USA), and analyzed using a FACSAria™ flow cytometer
(BD Bioscience) and ModFit LT software (Topsham,
ME, USA).

Biotechnology (CA, USA). Phosphorylation site-specific
anti-P-Ser780-pRb, anti-P-Ser795-pRb, anti-P-Ser473AKT and anti-Phospho-p44/42-MAPK antibodies were
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).
Anti-β-ACTIN was from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Cells were homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40;
0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; 1 mM EDTA; 1
mM PMSF; 1 mg/ml Aprotinin), and proteins quantified
using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit
(Pierce, IL, USA). A total of 10-50 μg proteins were
fractionated on 10-12% gels using SDS-PAGE, transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, NJ,
USA) under wet conditions, then immunoblotted with the
appropriate antibodies.

Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time
PCR
Total RNA was isolated from MSCs using Trizol
(ThermoFisher Scientific, CA, USA) and an RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the M-MLV
Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Promega, WI, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative
real-time PCR analysis was performed with ABI SYBR
Green Master Mix (Thermofisher Scientific, CA, USA)
in an ABI7500 Real-time PCR System according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Each sample was run
in triplicate for each gene. Transcript levels were
normalized to the housekeeping gene phosphoglycerate
kinase (PGK) and analyzed by the relative quantification
2-ΔΔCt method. All gene primers were obtained
from SBS (Beijing, China). The primers are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. To know other gene changes in
PC-9/AB2 cells, we used Affymetrix GeneChip probe to
test the gene changes in the RNA of PC-9/AB2 cell in
four groups, Control, PD 0332991, Geftinib and PD+G.
Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome Array, which
contains more than 54,000 probe sets to cover over
47,000 transcripts and variants, represent approximately
39,000 of the best characterized human genes, was used
in microarray analysis. Hybridization, data capture, and
analysis were performed by CapitalBio Corporation
(Beijing, China), a service provider authorized by
Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 100 ng of
total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, and produce
biotin-tagged cRNA by Trizol method. 15μg fragmented
cRNA, with contol oligo B2 and eukaryotic hybridization
controls (bioB, bioC, bioD, cre) was hybridized to
each GeneChip array at 45°C for 16 hours (Affymetrix
GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. After hybridization, the
GeneChip arrays were washed, and then stained with
streptavidin phycoerythrinonan (SAPE) with Affymetrix
Fluidics Station 450 followed by scanning with the
Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.

Tumor xenografts and survival analysis
BALB/c nude mice, 4-5 weeks old, were obtained
from the Chinese Military Academy of Medical Sciences
(Beijing, China). All mice were maintained under
specific-pathogen free conditions and examined prior to
the initiation of studies to ensure that they were healthy
and had acclimated to the laboratory environment. PC-9/
AB2 cells (2 × 106) in 0.2 ml medium were injected
subcutaneously into the right groin of each nude mouse.
Tumor volume was determined by caliper measurements
of tumor length (L) and width (W) according to the
formula LW2/2. Mice were randomized into 4 groups
when tumors reached 200 mm3 (10 mice per group):
1) Vehicle group, administered 0.5% methylcellulose,
400 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan)
and sodium lactate buffer by daily oral gavage; 2)
PD 0332991 group, administered at 150 mg/kg/day
PD 0332991 suspended in sodium lactate buffer (50
mmol/L, pH 4.0) and 0.5% methylcellulose, 400 by
daily oral gavage; 3) Gefitinib group, administered 100
mg/kg/day gefitinib dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose,
400 and sodium lactate buffer by daily oral gavage; and
4) PD 0332991 plus gefitinib group, administered 100
mg/kg/day gefitinib and 150 mg/kg/day PD0332991
simultaneously by daily oral gavage. All four
groups received treatment for 14 days. Tumor size
measurements were taken every other day.

Immunohistochemistry
Serial (4 mm) sections from paraffin-embedded
conventional tissues were deparaffinized in xylene
and hydrated in a series of graded alcohols. Heatinduced antigen retrieval was carried out by microwave
pretreatment in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 10.0, for 15 min. An
overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies (antiCD34, at 1:500 dilution; anti-Ki67, at 1:500 dilution) was
performed. Appropriate positive and negative controls
were used for each experiment. The Kawai method was

used to calculate a semi-quantitative score from 1 to 16
for staining of each tissue core. The number of positive
cells was estimated and assigned a number score: 1 =
<25%, 2 = 25%-50%, 3 = 50%-75%, and 4 = >75%. The
intensity of staining was determined where 1 = none,
2 = weak, 3 = intermediate, and 4 = strong. The first
and second scores were then multiplied resulting in a
maximum staining score of 16 for any tissue core. Results
were analyzed by Wilcoxon statistics, which correct for
agreement by chance, and by percent agreement.
