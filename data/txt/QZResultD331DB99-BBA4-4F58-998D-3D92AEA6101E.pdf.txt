Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) can be successfully treated with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec);
however, complete remissions are rare and patients frequently achieve disease stabilization in the presence
of residual tumor masses. The clinical observation that discontinuation of treatment can lead to tumor progression suggests that residual tumor cells are, in fact, quiescent and, therefore, able to re-enter the cell-division
cycle. In line with this notion, we have previously shown that imatinib induces GIST cell quiescence in vitro
through the APCCDH1–SKP2–p27Kip1 signaling axis. Here, we provide evidence that imatinib induces GIST cell
quiescence in vivo and that this process also involves the DREAM complex, a multisubunit complex that has
recently been identiﬁed as an additional key regulator of quiescence. Importantly, inhibition of DREAM
complex formation by depletion of the DREAM regulatory kinase DYRK1A or its target LIN52 was found to
enhance imatinib-induced cell death. Our results show that imatinib induces apoptosis in a fraction of GIST cells
while, at the same time, a subset of cells undergoes quiescence involving the DREAM complex. Inhibition of this
process enhances imatinib-induced apoptosis, which opens the opportunity for future therapeutic interventions
to target the DREAM complex for more efﬁcient imatinib responses. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5120–9. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), the
most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal
tract, are characterized by oncogenic mutations in the KIT or
platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFRA) receptor
tyrosine kinase (1–3). Because these oncogenic mutations lead
to constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the receptor,
GISTs can be successfully treated with the small-molecule
kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; ref. 4). Although
approximately 85% of patients with advanced or metastatic

disease beneﬁt from imatinib treatment, complete responses
are rare and the majority of patients only achieve partial
response or stable disease with remaining tumor load (5).
Successful cancer therapy is often hampered by the occurrence of tumor cell quiescence, because quiescent cells remain
viable and, therefore, are a reservoir for tumor progression (6–
8). This reversible exit from the cell division cycle and entry into
G0 has previously been shown to involve the anaphase-promoting complex (APC)CDH1–SKP2–p27Kip1 signaling axis (9–
13). In this pathway, the APC, together with its activator CDH1,
promotes the polyubiquitylation and subsequent degradation
of SKP2, a substrate adaptor component of the SCF (SKP1–
Cullin–F-box) complex. SKP2 loss results in the accumulation
of its target, the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1, and the reinforcement
of a quiescent state. In a previous study, we could show that
this process is active in imatinib-treated GIST cells (14).
A second major group of proteins that negatively regulate
the cell cycle are the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein
(pRB) and the related "pocket protein" family members p107
(RBL1) and p130 (RBL2; refs. 15, 16). p130 has been shown to
accumulate in G0, when it interacts with E2F4 to repress E2Fdependent gene transcription (17–19). p130 protein levels are
also regulated by SKP2 (20), which emphasizes that quiescence
involves multiple interconnected pathway components.
In line with this notion, it has been shown that p130/E2F4
are part of a larger, multisubunit protein complex, the mammalian DREAM complex (21). This complex consists of DP,
RBL2 (p130), E2F4 and the mammalian homologs of the
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) synthetic multivulva class

DREAM Complex Mediates Quiescence in GIST

B (synMuvB) gene products LIN9, LIN37, LIN52, LIN53/RBBP4,
and LIN54 (21). The DREAM complex forms in G0 and represses
E2F target genes. In humans, LIN9, LIN37, LIN52, LIN53/
RBBP4, and LIN54 have been shown to form a stable complex
(the MuvB core) that dissociates from p130 and E2F4/DP in
S phase and, instead, binds to B-MYB, when it is referred to
as the MYB–MuvB (MMB) complex (21–23). In a recent
study, phosphorylation of the DREAM component LIN52 at
Ser28 was shown to regulate complex formation in G0 (24).
This phosphorylation is mediated by members of the dual
speciﬁcity tyrosine-phosphorylation–regulated kinase (DYRK)
family, speciﬁcally DYRK1A and potentially DYRK1B (24).
Here, we show that imatinib induces GIST cell quiescence in
vivo and in vitro and that this process involves the DREAM
complex as evidenced by upregulation of p130, increased p130/
E2F4/LIN37 complex formation, and enhanced phosphorylation of the DREAM subunit LIN52. Importantly, abrogation of
quiescence by siRNA-mediated knock-down of LIN52 or the
DYRK1A kinase were both found to signiﬁcantly increase
imatinib-induced GIST cell apoptosis. Therefore, interference
with DREAM-mediated quiescence can enhance imatinibinduced anti-GIST cell activity, which emphasizes the relevance of the DREAM complex as novel drug target warranting
further preclinical and clinical investigations.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, inhibitor treatments, and transfections
The human GIST cell line GIST882 (a generous gift from
Jonathan A. Fletcher, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard
Medical School, Boston, MA) was derived from an untreated
metastatic GIST and maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 15% FBS (Gemini BioProducts), 1% L-glutamine, 50 U/mL
penicillin (Cambrex), and 50 mg/mL streptomycin (Cambrex)
as described previously (25).
Cells were incubated in imatinib mesylate [1 mmol/L in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); LC Laboratories), harmine (10
mmol/L in DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich), or mock-treated with
0.1% DMSO for up to 72 hours or as indicated.
For siRNA experiments, single RNA duplexes were used to
reduce protein expression of members of the DREAM complex
(Qiagen) and DYRK1A (Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Brieﬂy, GIST882 cells were trypsinized and 3  106 cells were
transfected with 5 mL of 10 mmol/L annealed RNA duplexes
using nucleofection (Amaxa/Lonza). For dual knockdown
experiments, 2.5 mL of 20 mmol/L of each annealed RNA
duplexes was used. Cells were then transferred to 35 mm
tissue culture dishes with 2 mL RPMI-1640 free of antibiotics.
Cells were either incubated for 72 hours without further
manipulation before further processing or treated with 1
mmol/L imatinib of 0.1% DMSO at 24 hours after transfection
and incubated for another 48 hours (72 hours total). Knockdown efﬁciency was monitored by immunoblotting or quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR; for
LIN54 only).
Immunologic and cell-staining methods
Protein lysates of cells growing as monolayer were prepared
by scraping cells into lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 50 mmol/L Tris–

HCl pH 8.0, 100 mmol/L sodium ﬂuoride, 30 mmol/L sodium
pyrophosphate, 2 mmol/L sodium molybdate, 5 mmol/L
EDTA, 2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate) containing protease
inhibitors (10 mg/mL aprotinin, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride). Lysates were incubated for 1
hour with shaking at 4 C and then cleared by centrifugation for
30 minutes at 14,000 rpm at 4 C. Protein concentrations were
determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Thereafter, 30 mg
of protein was loaded on a 4% to 12% Bis–Tris gel (Invitrogen)
and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using TrueBlot IP/
Western reagents (Rockland Immunochemicals) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
For immunoﬂuorescence analysis, cells grown on coverslips were brieﬂy washed in PBS and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cells
were then washed in PBS and permeabilized with 1% TritonX 100 in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature followed by
washing in PBS and blocking with 10% normal donkey serum
(Jackson Immunoresearch) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4 C in a humidiﬁed chamber and incubated for
another 3 hours at 37 C the next morning. After a brief wash
in PBS, cells were incubated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) for at least 2 hours at 37 C, washed with PBS, and
counterstained with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Vector Laboratories). Cells were analyzed using an Olympus
AX70 epiﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a SpotRT
digital camera.
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopic staining of parafﬁnembedded sections was done as described previously (26). In
brief, slides were deparafﬁnized in xylene and rehydrated in a
graded ethanol series. After microwaving in 0.01 mol/L citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes, slides were washed in distilled
water and PBS before continuing with staining as described
earlier.
Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunoﬂuorescence were actin (Sigma); bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd;
Roche Applied Science); cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling
Technology); cyclin A (Novocastra); DYRK1A and E2F4 (both
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology); pKIT Y719 (Cell Signaling
Technology); KIT (DakoCytomation); LIN9, LIN37, LIN52,
pLIN52 S28, and LIN54 (all from Litovchick and colleagues,
refs. 21, 24); p27Kip1 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), p27Kip1
(Invitrogen/Zymed Laboratories and Becton Dickinson); p130
(RBL2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and PARP and SKP2 (both
from Invitrogen/Zymed Laboratories).
BrdUrd assay
To assess the proliferating cell fraction, GIST882 cells were
incubated in BrdUrd labeling medium (Roche Applied Science)
for 2 hours. Cells were then washed in PBS and ﬁxed in ice-cold
methanol for 10 minutes. After another wash in PBS, DNA
was denatured by incubation in 2 N HCl for 1 hour at 37 C. The
HCl was neutralized by immersion in 0.1 mol/L borate buffer,
pH 8.5, before incubation with a mouse monoclonal antiBrdUrd antibody (Roche) overnight at 4 C in a humidiﬁed

animal experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee
of KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium).

Senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity
Senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity was assessed
using the Senescence b-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Results

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
For qRT-PCR, cells were transfected with control siRNA or
siRNA duplexes targeting LIN54 and RNA was extracted using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. RNA was treated with DNase I enzyme (Fermentas)
to remove any contaminating traces of genomic DNA, and
cDNA was transcribed by RT-PCR using random primers and
the Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas).
LIN54 and b-actin cDNA was ampliﬁed using exon-overlapping, mRNA/cDNA-speciﬁc primers to LIN54 (forward: 5'ATTGCTAAGAAGCCTCGAACG-3', reverse: 5'-TGGTGAAACTTGAGTTGTCTGTC-3'; IDT, Leuven, Belgium) and b-actin
(forward: 5'-CCAAGGCCAACCGCGAGAAGATGAC-3', reverse:
5'-AGGGTACATGGTGGTGCCGCCAGAC-3') and measured
using the SsoFast EvaGreen Kit (Bio-Rad). Cycling conditions
were 95 C (30 seconds, activation), 95 C (5 seconds, denaturation), 55 C (10 seconds, annealing/extension) for 40 cycles on
a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System run on a C1000 Thermal
Cycler platform (Bio-Rad). b-Actin served as the reference gene
for relative quantiﬁcation.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle analysis was conducted by measuring the amount
of propidium iodide (PI)-labeled DNA in ethanol-ﬁxed cells. In
brief, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with
prechilled PBS (1% FBS), and ﬁxed with ice-cold 70% ethanol.
After the ﬁxation step, the cells were washed with PBS/1% FBS,
resuspended in PI (Sigma-Aldrich)/RNase staining solution (50
mg/mL PI, 10 mmol/L Tris pH 7.5, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mg/mL
RNase) and incubated at 37 C in the dark for 30 minutes. The
analysis was conducted in the University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute Flow Cytometry Core Facility using a Gallios Flow
Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and the Kaluza 5 acquisition
software.
GIST xenograft models
For mouse xenograft models, GIST882 cells [carrying a KIT
p.K642E (exon 13) mutation)] or tumors originating from the
biopsies of two patients [bearing KIT p.V650D (exon 11) or
KIT p.A502_Y503dup (exon 9) mutations, respectively] were
implanted in both ﬂanks of two mice as described previously
(27). Second-passage xenografts were generated by explanting established xenografts and implanting them into the
ﬂanks of a second set of mice. When tumors were 1 cm in
diameter, mice were treated with placebo or imatinib (100
mg/kg, orally daily) for 12 days. Tumor volume, weight, and
general health of the mice were recorded as previously
described (27). After the mice were sacriﬁced, tumors were
excised and processed for histopathologic examination. The

Imatinib induces GIST cell quiescence in vivo and in vitro
To analyze imatinib-induced quiescence in vivo, several cell
line- and patient-derived GIST xenograft models were analyzed
(Fig. 1; ref. 27). Mice were treated with placebo or imatinib and
tumor tissues were stained for the quiescence marker p27Kip1.
Imatinib treatment led to a signiﬁcant increase of tumor cells
exhibiting nuclear p27Kip1 staining in GIST882 xenografts (Fig.
1A) and patient-derived xenografts carrying a mutation in KIT
exon 11 (Fig. 1B) thereby conﬁrming the ability of imatinib to
induce quiescence in GIST cells in vivo. A xenograft derived
from a tumor with a KIT exon 9 mutation showed only a
minimal increase in nuclear p27Kip1 staining. This was not due
to differences in the expression of its upstream regulator SKP2
(Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that baseline SKP2 levels
do not determine levels of p27Kip1 after imatinib treatment.
Remarkably, KIT exon 9 mutations are known to be associated
with a reduced sensitivity to imatinib in patients with GIST
(28), but there are currently no GIST cell line models available
to dissect the precise underlying molecular mechanisms.
A main characteristic of quiescence is the fact that it is
reversible, in contrast to cellular senescence, which is largely
irreversible (29). To further corroborate the fact that imatinib treatment leads to quiescence and not senescence in
GIST cells, GIST882 cells were treated with imatinib for 72
hours (3 days), after which the drug-containing media was
removed and cells were cultured without drug for up to 11
days. The percentage of cells in S-phase was measured by
BrdUrd incorporation and was found to decrease signiﬁcantly during imatinib treatment (from 26.9% to 1.3%; Fig.
1C), with a subset of cells showing morphologic signs of
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, 5 days after
drug washout, a signiﬁcant increase of cells in S-phase was
observed and cellular proliferation was restored to pretreatment levels at 7 to 9 days after imatinib removal (Fig. 1C).
These ﬁndings were corroborated by immunoblot analyses
(Fig. 2A), showing that inhibition of KIT phosphorylation by
imatinib is completely reversible after imatinib washout. KIT
reactivation was associated with a cell-cycle reentry (as measured by expression levels of SKP2, p27Kip1, and cyclin A) at day
5 after drug removal. These results conﬁrm clinical ﬁndings
showing that metastatic or inoperable GISTs resume growth
when imatinib treatment is discontinued (30).
The same study (30) reported that GISTs, which progress
after discontinuation of imatinib, usually do retain their
responsiveness to imatinib during further treatment. To recapitulate these ﬁndings in vitro and to test whether there would
be any detectable differences between imatinib-na€ve and
imatinib-pretreated cells, we re-exposed GIST cells that had
completed one imatinib washout cycle (i.e., 11 days after
removal of drug) to imatinib in comparison to imatinib-na€ve
GIST cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, prior imatinib-induced quiescence had no effect on inhibition of KIT phosphorylation,
induction of apoptosis, or induction of cell-cycle arrest when
cells were re-exposed to the drug. There was, in fact, a more

pronounced PARP cleavage band that most likely reﬂects cell
synchronization. These results provide in vitro evidence that
pretreated GIST cells retain their responsiveness to antineoplastic activities of imatinib as suggested by previous clinical
reports.
The results shown above imply that GIST cells either undergo apoptosis or enter quiescence after imatinib treatment
and, furthermore, that imatinib does not lead to a senescent
phenotype, that is, permanent cell-cycle exit. To corroborate
the latter notion, we stained imatinib-treated GIST882 cells
for senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) activity
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). There was a low (<5%) baseline level
of SA-b–gal-positive multinucleated cells, but no change in the
percentage of SA b–gal-positive cells was detected when
imatinib-treated cells were compared with control-treated
cells. Furthermore, immunoﬂuorescence microscopic staining
of the senescence-associated marker p16INK4A (CDKN2A) of
imatinib-treated GIST882 cell populations did not reveal any
changes in total protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Taken

together, these results indicate that indeed most, if not all,
GIST cells undergo either apoptosis or quiescence when treated with imatinib and that imatinib does not induce a senescence phenotype in these cells.
The DREAM complex is involved in imatinib-induced
quiescence
The multiprotein DREAM complex was recently identiﬁed
as one of the key regulators of cellular quiescence in addition to
the APCCDH1–SKP1–p27Kip1 signaling axis (21). We therefore
tested whether imatinib-induced quiescence in GIST cells
involves DREAM complex-mediated mechanisms.
To test this hypothesis, we initially focused on the core
members of the DREAM complex, p130 (RBL2) and the mammalian MuvB homolog LIN37. As expected, imatinib induced a
time-dependent increase of p130 protein expression (Fig. 3A)
indicating cellular quiescence. Conversely, p130 expression
decreased when imatinib was removed, indicating exit from
quiescence and cell-cycle reentry (Fig. 3B). At the same time,

manipulated to enter and exit from quiescence.

LIN37 levels remained largely unchanged, which is line with a
previous report (22).
These results were corroborated by immunoﬂuorescence
microscopic analyses showing a signiﬁcantly enhanced nuclear staining of p130 after imatinib treatment from 13.2% to
49.2% (P < 0.0015, Student t test for independent samples; Fig.
3C), in line with what previously has been reported for quiescent cells (31).
We next sought to directly test imatinib-induced DREAM
complex assembly. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments conﬁrmed an enhanced formation of a complex among p130, E2F4,
and LIN37 after imatinib treatment of GIST cells (Fig. 3D).
Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence
for a critical role of the DREAM complex in the induction of
quiescence in imatinib-treated GIST cells.
The DREAM complex is a modulator of the cellular
response to imatinib and is a potential therapeutic target
Having shown that the DREAM complex is involved in the
induction of imatinib-induced quiescence, we next wanted to
test whether its disruption could be exploited therapeutically.

Knockdown of single DREAM complex subunits (p130, E2F4,
LIN9, LIN37, or LIN54) did not result in a signiﬁcant increase
of imatinib-induced GIST cell apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S4A) indicating a certain redundancy of DREAM complex
components as previously suggested (21).
A combined knockdown of E2F4 and LIN54, however, was
able to enhance GIST cell apoptosis from 36.6% in control
siRNA-transfected and imatinib-treated cells to 53.1% in E2F4/
LIN54 siRNA-transfected and imatinib-treated cells (P < 0.001;
Supplementary Fig. S4B). E2F4/LIN54 knockdown lead to an
increased DNA synthesis in comparison with control siRNAtransfected cells as measured by BrdUrd incorporation (30.0%
vs. 21.0% BrdUrd-positive cells, respectively), suggesting that
inhibition of efﬁcient DREAM complex formation resulted
in increased baseline proliferation in GIST cells (P < 0.001;
Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Phosphorylation of DREAM complex component LIN52 at
serine 28 (S28) by the DYRK1A protein kinase has previously
been reported to play an important role in DREAM complex
assembly and activity (24). We, therefore, asked whether
this process also plays a role in imatinib-induced GIST cell
quiescence. pLIN52 S28 indeed, increased in imatinib-treated
GIST cells as shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A) whereas basal
expression levels of DYRK1A and LIN52 remained unchanged,
which is line with a previous report (24). LIN52 phosphorylation and, therefore, DREAM complex formation were reversible
because pLIN52 S28 expression was undetectable after removal
of imatinib (Fig. 4B).
We next analyzed GIST882 cells in which LIN52 or DYRK1A
have been depleted by siRNA (Fig. 4C). Flow cytometry showed
a cell-cycle arrest in G2–M in LIN52-depleted GIST cells (Fig
4D). However, when LIN52-depleted cells were treated with
imatinib, we found a statistically signiﬁcant, 19.5-fold increase
of apoptosis from 2.64% in DMSO-treated, LIN52-depleted
cells to 37.51% in imatinib-treated, LIN52-depleted GIST cells
(Fig. 4D and E; P < 0.0001).
We then tested whether interference with DYRK1A can also
modulate GIST cell apoptosis in response to imatinib. Because
DYRK1A is a protein kinase, it is possible to inhibit its activity
with pharmacologic agents such as harmine. Harmine is a
b-carboline alkaloid with ATP-competitive activity toward
DYRK1A (32). We treated GIST882 cells with harmine and
found an enhanced cell death in combination with imatinib
when compared with imatinib as a single agent (Fig. 5A and B).
The abrogation of imatinib-induced quiescence by harmine
is shown by the reduction of p130 protein expression levels
(Fig. 5A). We next used siRNA to knockdown DYRK1A expression and found an induction of apoptosis in DYRK1A-depleted
GIST cells (Fig. 5C). When DYRK1A-depleted cells were treated
with imatinib, a statistically signiﬁcant, 24-fold increase of
apoptosis was detected (Fig. 5C and D;  , P < 0.0001).
Collectively, these results show that abrogation of DREAM
complex components can signiﬁcantly increase the apoptotic
response of GIST cells to imatinib.

Discussion
GISTs can successfully be treated with imatinib, but complete remissions are rare and most patients with advanced or

metastatic tumors only experience disease stabilization or a
partial remission. It has been shown that the remaining tumor
mass contains viable GIST cells even while still responding to
imatinib, and that these cells resume proliferation when
imatinib treatment is discontinued (14, 30, 33).
In the present report, we corroborate that imatinib
induces GIST cell quiescence not only in vitro but also in
vivo using cell line- and patient-derived mouse xenografts. In
line with clinical observations, we ﬁnd that drug removal
leads to reactivation of cellular proliferation, yet does not
affect the sensitivity of GIST cells when rechallenged with
imatinib. We have previously shown that imatinib-induced
quiescence involves the APCCDH1–SKP2–p27Kip1 axis (14).
Here, we provide evidence for a second pathway that contributes critically to imatinib-induced quiescence in GIST
cells that involves the DREAM complex. This multisubunit
complex consists of the pRB-related protein p130, E2F4, DP,
LIN9, LIN37, LIN52, LIN53/RBBP4, and LIN54 (21, 22).
DREAM complex formation occurs in G0 to repress E2F
target genes in a process that involves phosphorylation of
DREAM component LIN52 at S28 by the DYRK1A protein
kinase. Our results are in full agreement with this model
because we show increased p130 expression and enhanced
p130 nuclear translocation, p130/E2F4/LIN37 complex formation, and increased pLIN52 S28 phosphorylation in imatinib-treated GIST cells. It is noteworthy that SKP2 provides

www.aacrjournals.org

a link between the two quiescence-associated signaling
pathways as it also regulates p130 levels (20).
One of the key ﬁndings of the present study is that abrogation of quiescence by either siRNA or a pharmacologic agent
that inhibits DYRK1A kinase activity can signiﬁcantly enhance
imatinib-induced GIST cell apoptosis. Although the precise
mechanism warrants further investigation, in the most simplistic model, GIST cells that are prevented from entering a
state of quiescence now undergo apoptosis when exposed to
imatinib. We have previously shown that imatinib-induced cell
death involves upregulation of core histone variant H2AX,
followed by chromatin condensation and a transcriptional
block (25). Although H2AX mRNA is synthesized in all phases
of the cell division cycle (34), more than 90% of total histone
synthesis takes place in S-phase (35). It is conceivable that cells
that are unable to enter quiescence and continue to proliferate
are more vulnerable to imatinib-induced H2AX upregulation
and subsequent cell death than cells that have exited the cell
cycle and have a reduced or no H2AX expression.
The precise mechanism of imatinib-induced quiescence,
including p130 upregulation and enhanced phosphorylation
of LIN52 leading to DREAM complex activation, remains to be
determined. Whereas the former event could be related to
reduced SKP2 expression leading to p130 accumulation, it is
unlikely that DYRK1A activity is acutely regulated on the level
of gene expression or protein abundance, because its levels did

not change after imatinib treatment or during the cell cycle
(24). In contrast, stimulation of DYRK1A likely involves activity
through modulation of feedback loops, such as LATS2 activity
(36) or interaction with SPRED1 (37) or 14-3-3 (38). These
possibilities warrant further experimentation.
The fact that formation of the DREAM complex is regulated
by phosphorylation of its subunit LIN52 offers a window of
opportunity for therapeutic interventions. The plant alkaloid
harmine, which was used in the current study, displays speciﬁcity for DYRK1A (39), but its strong inhibitory effect on
monoamine oxidase A and hallucinogenic properties unfortunately limit its use in patients (40). A recently described
synthetic inhibitor of DYRK1A, INDY, was found to be active
in several in vitro and in vivo models and may show an

5126

improved toxicity proﬁle (41). Further support for the concept of quiescence inhibition as a strategy for cancer therapy
stems from a previous study in ovarian cancer (42). This
report focused on DYRK1A family member DYRK1B, which is
overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma cells and has also been
shown to be capable of phosphorylating LIN52 (24). Inhibition of DYRK1B by RO5454948, a compound that also
inhibits DYRK1A, led to escape from quiescence and an
increased apoptotic response (42). Importantly, treatment
with RO5454948 did not affect the viability of normal ovarian
epithelial cells.
Results shown here lend further support to the notion that
induction of tumor cell quiescence can negatively affect antineoplastic therapies. It is remarkable that imatinib itself is able

DREAM Complex Mediates Quiescence in GIST

to stimulate quiescence in a subset of GIST cells, thereby
intrinsically limiting its own effectiveness. Our ﬁndings, therefore, emphasize the need to exploit synthetic lethal approaches
such as KIT and DYRK1A inhibition as shown here to increase
antitumor efﬁcacy.
One of the key remaining questions is what determines
whether GIST cells undergo apoptosis or quiescence when
treated with imatinib. It is possible that the cell-cycle stage at
the time of treatment plays a role, but other mechanisms that
can modulate the switch between cell death and survival merit
further exploration. It is possible that whole genome or transcriptome analyses may allow a stratiﬁcation of GISTs as being
more prone to apoptosis or quiescence. In addition, it will be
important to determine whether E2F4 target genes, loss of the

www.aacrjournals.org

molecular components of the DREAM complex, or members of
the APCCDH1–SKP2–p27Kip1 signaling axis may play a role.
Thus far, mining of available databases did not yield any
insights into these open questions that warrant more detailed
investigations.
Taken together, we show here that the DREAM complex is a
critical mediator of imatinib-induced GIST cell quiescence and
that abrogation of quiescence enhances the proapoptotic
activity of imatinib. The DREAM complex is, therefore, a
promising therapeutic target to make imatinib treatment more
effective with an aim toward more complete patient responses.
