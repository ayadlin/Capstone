ABSTRACT
Inhibition of BET bromodomains (BRDs) has emerged as a promising cancer
therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, inhibitors of BRDs such as JQ1 have been actively
developed and some have reached clinical testing. However, the mechanisms by
which this group of inhibitors exerts their anticancer activity, including induction
of apoptosis, have not been fully elucidated. This report reveals a previously
uncovered activity of JQ1 in inducing c-FLIP degradation and enhancing TRAILinduced apoptosis. JQ1 potently decreased c-FLIP (both long and short forms) levels
in multiple cancer cell lines without apparently increasing the expression of DR5
and DR4. Consequently, JQ1, when combined with TRAIL, synergistically induced
apoptosis; this enhanced apoptosis-inducing activity could be abolished by enforced
expression of ectopic FLIPL or FLIPS. Hence it appears that JQ1 decreases c-FLIP
levels, resulting in enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of proteasome
with MG132 prevented JQ1-induced c-FLIP reduction. Moreover, JQ1 decreased c-FLIP
stability. Therefore, JQ1 apparently decreases c-FLIP levels through facilitating its
proteasomal degradation. Genetic inhibition of either BRD4 or c-Myc by knocking
down their expression failed to mimic JQ1 in decreasing c-FLIP and enhancing TRAILinduced apoptosis, suggesting that JQ1 induces c-FLIP degradation and enhances
TRAIL-induced apoptosis independent of BRD4 or c-Myc inhibition. In summary, our
findings in this study highlights a novel biological function of JQ1 in modulating
apoptosis and warrant further study of the potential treatment of cancer with the
JQ1 and TRAIL combination.

INTRODUCTION

therapeutic strategy [1, 2].
In the past few years, several small molecule
inhibitors that target BET family proteins, particularly
BRD4, have been developed. These inhibitors have been
actively used either as therapeutic agents or as research
tools in many preclinical studies and some of them
have advanced to testing in clinical trials [1, 2]. JQ1, a
triazolothienodiazepine (Figure 1A), is the first BET BRD
inhibitor developed for cancer therapy [3, 4] and hence
has been widely used. One initial putative mechanism
by which JQ1 and other BET BRD inhibitors exert their
anticancer activity is through suppression of c-Myc

The bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal
domain (BET) family is comprised of four proteins:
BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT, which perform diverse
roles in regulating gene transcription. These BET family
proteins have been identified in oncogenic rearrangements,
generating highly oncogenic fusion proteins, and in
regulating transcription of several oncogenes, such
as c-Myc and Bcl-2. Therefore they play key roles in
oncogenesis of certain types of cancer and accordingly,
targeting BET proteins has emerged as a promising cancer

expression [3, 5]. However, other mechanisms involving
regulation of a different set of cancer-relevant genes
independent of c-Myc have also been suggested [6, 7]. By
far, the majority of studies have shown that the therapeutic
effect of BET BRD inhibitors is attributed to targeting
BRD4, rather than the other BET proteins [2].
JQ1 and other BET BRD inhibitors have been
reported to induce apoptosis in some types of cancer cells
including lung cancer cells, contributing to their anticancer
activity [8-14]. However, the underlying mechanisms of
apoptosis induction are largely unclear other than Bim
involvement [10, 12]. In addition to single agent activity,
these inhibitors also act synergistically with other cancer
therapeutic agents such as HDAC inhibitors [15, 16],
mTOR inhibitors [13, 17, 18], and PI3K inhibitors [19]
in inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the growth of cancer
cells and tumors. Further evaluation of these combinations
in the clinic is thus warranted even though continuous
investigation of their biological actions is still needed.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL; also called APO-2L) is a well-known
death ligand or cytokine that initiates apoptosis upon
ligation with two death receptors named death receptor
4 (DR4) and 5 (DR5). TRAIL preferentially induces
apoptosis in transformed or malignant cells, but not in
most normal cells, and thus is a tumor-selective apoptosisinducing cytokine with cancer therapeutic potential [20,
21]. Recombinant human TRAIL is currently being tested
in clinical trials as a potential cancer therapeutic agent [2123]. Unfortunately cancer cells exhibit varied sensitivity to
TRAIL and a substantial proportion of cancer cell lines are
intrinsically insensitive to TRAIL [20]. Thus, additional
sensitization is needed to potentiate the killing effect of
TRAIL in these insensitive cancer cells.
Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), a
truncated form of caspase-8 that lacks enzymatic activity,
is known to be a negative regulator of TRAIL-induced
apoptosis by blocking the activation of caspase-8 through
competing with caspase-8 for binding to FADD [24].
Numerous studies have documented that elevated c-FLIP
expression protects cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis,
whereas downregulation of c-FLIP by chemicals or small
interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitizes cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis [25]. Elevated levels of c-FLIP have
been found in a number of different cancers and are often
correlated with a poor prognosis in certain types of cancers
[26]. Hence, downregulation of c-FLIP is an effective
strategy to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.
The current study has revealed a previously
uncovered biological function of JQ1 and other BET
BRD inhibitors in potently decreasing c-FLIP levels and
sensitizing cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
However these effects are not mediated by inhibition of
either BRD4 or c-Myc.

JQ1 decreases c-FLIP levels in cancer cell lines
Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
lines display varied sensitivities to JQ1 treatment [6, 14],
with some being quite resistant [6]. In an effort to identify
agents that suppress c-FLIP expression, we found that JQ1
at a range of 1 to 5 µM effectively decreased the levels
of c-FLIP including both long (FLIPL) and short (FLIPS)
forms in the 3 tested JQ1-senstive NSCLC cell lines,
H157, H1299 and A549 (Figures. 1B and 1C). Apparent
reduction of c-FLIP occurred at 3 h post JQ1 treatment
and was sustained up to 16 h (Figure 1D). Under the tested
conditions, JQ1 did not obviously increase DR5 expression
and decrease the levels of Mcl-1, Bcl-XL and survivin in
any of the tested cell lines. JQ1 weakly decreased Bcl-2
levels in H1299 and A549 cells, but not in H157 cells.
Interestingly, JQ1 decreased DR4 expression, particularly
in H157 and H1299 cells. JQ1 partially decreased c-Myc
levels in H1299 cells, but increased its levels in H157 and
A549 cells (Figure 1C). Hence, JQ1 effectively decreases
c-FLIP levels in cancer cells.

JQ1 synergizes with TRAIL to induce apoptosis
Next we determined whether JQ1 sensitizes cancer
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis due to its c-FLIPreducing activity. In two TRAIL-insensitive cell lines,
A549 and H1299, the combination of JQ1 and TRAIL was
much more active than either agent alone in decreasing
the survival of cancer cells (Figure 2A). The combination
indexes (CIs) for every combination were far less than 1,
indicating strong synergy. In agreement, the combination
of JQ1 and TRAIL was much more potent than either
single agent alone in inducing cleavage of caspase-8,
caspase-3 and PARP, hallmarks of apoptosis, and in
enhancing Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells in both
A549 and H1299 cells (Figures. 2B and 2C). Together
these results robustly indicate that the JQ1 and TRAIL
combination displays synergistic effect in the induction of
apoptosis.

Enforced ectopic c-FLIP overexpression abolishes
synergistic induction of apoptosis by the JQ1 and
TRAIL combination
To explore the role of c-FLIP downregulation in
the synergistic induction of apoptosis by the JQ1 and
TRAIL combination, we compared the effects of JQ1
plus TRAIL on apoptosis induction in H157 cell lines
that express ectopic Lac Z (as a control), FLIPL or FLIPS
(Figure 3A). Both JQ1 and TRAIL alone minimally or

weakly decreased cell survival and induced cleavage
of caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP in H157-Lac Z cells.
The combination of JQ1 and TRAIL, however, exerted
synergistic effects on decreasing cell survival (CIs < 1)
and inducing caspase cleavage in this cell line. These
synergistic effects were lost in H157-FLIPL and H157-

FLIPS cells (Figures. 3B and 3C). Similar results were also
observed in A549 cells that express ectopic FLIPL (data
not shown). These data thus clearly suggest that c-FLIP
downregulation is critical for the enhancement of TRAILinduced apoptosis by JQ1.

JQ1 promotes c-FLIP protein degradation

decreases the levels of c-FLIPs involving facilitation of
their degradation.

Given that c-FLIPs are unstable proteins subjected
to proteasomal degradation [27, 28], we then determined
whether JQ1 facilitates proteasomal degradation of
c-FLIP, causing c-FLIP reduction in cancer cells. We
found that the presence of the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 prevented both forms of c-FLIP from reduction
induced by JQ1 (Figure 4A). Moreover, the half-lives of
both FLIPL and FLIPS in JQ1-treated cells were shorter
than those in DMSO-treated cells (Figure 4B), indicating
that JQ1 facilitates c-FLIP degradation or decreases
their stability. Collectively these results suggest that JQ1

JQ1-induced c-FLIP reduction and enhancement
of TRAIL-induced apoptosis are independent of
BRD4 and c-Myc inhibition
One putative mechanism of action of BET BRD
inhibitors involves suppression of c-Myc [3, 5]. To
determine whether JQ1-induced c-FLIP reduction is
the consequence of BRD4 or c-Myc inhibition, we first
analyzed the effects of other BET BRD inhibitors on

altering c-FLIP levels and enhancing TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. OTX015, a compound highly related to JQ1 in
chemical structure (Figure 5A), was as effective as JQ1
in decreasing the levels of c-FLIP (Figure 5B). PFI-1 and
MS436, which have distinct chemical structures from JQ1,
either weakly decreased (PFI-1) or even slightly increased
(MS436) c-FLIP levels (Figure 5B). Consistently,
OTX05, but not PFI-1 and MS436, enhanced TRAILinduced apoptosis, as evidenced by increased cleavage of
caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP, as did JQ1 (Figure 5C).
Moreover, we used a more specific genetic
approach by directly knocking down BRD4 or c-Myc and
investigating the impact of their knockdown on c-FLIP
levels and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of
BRD4 actually slightly increased c-FLIP levels in A549

and H157 cells, but slightly decreased c-FLIP levels
in H1299 and HCC827 cells (Figure. 6A). Similarly,
knockdown of c-Myc increased c-FLIP levels in H1299
and A549 cells, but decreased c-FLIP levels in H157
cells (Figure 6B). Hence it is clear that knockdown of
both BRD4 and c-Myc generates mixed effects on c-FLIP
levels depending on cell lines. Moreover, knockdown of
either BRD4 or c-Myc did not apparently enhance the
potency of TRAIL in decreasing cell survival (Figure
6C) and in inducing cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3
and PARP (Figure 6D) in both H1299 and A549 cells,
indicating that genetic suppression of BRD4 or c-Myc did
not accordingly sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. Taking these data together, we suggest that
genetic inhibition of BRD4 or c-Myc does not mimic

DISCUSSION

the ability of JQ1 to decrease c-FLIP levels and enhance
TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

The current study has shown that JQ1 decreases
c-FLIP levels and enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in cancer cells, uncovering a novel biological function of
JQ1 in the regulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In
this study, JQ1 substantially decreased c-FLIP (both FLIPL
and FLIPS) levels without increasing the expression of
DR4 and DR5, two other critical components in mediating
TRAIL-induced apoptosis [22]. Moreover, enforced
expression of ectopic c-FLIP abrogates the ability of JQ1
to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, it is
very likely that JQ1 synergizes with TRAIL to augment
apoptosis primarily through c-FLIP downregulation.
Although suppression of other anti-apoptotic proteins
such as Bcl-2 family members and survivin sensitizes
cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [30], JQ1 did
not decrease the levels of Bcl-XL, Mcl-1 and survivin
in every tested cell lines except for weak effects on
reducing Bcl-2 in H1299 and A549 cells. Therefore, JQ1induced enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis is not
associated with modulation of these proteins.

Inhibition of c-Myc elevation fails to abolish the
ability of JQ1 to reduce c-FLIP levels
In our study, we found that JQ1 increased the levels
of c-Myc in A549 and H157 cells as presented in Figure
1. A previous study has suggested that c-Myc directly
suppresses c-FLIP gene expression [29]. To determine
whether JQ1-induced c-FLIP reduction is connected to
c-Myc upregulation in these two cell lines, we used c-Myc
siRNA transfection to knock down c-Myc expression
including c-Myc upregulation induced by JQ1 and then
examined its impact on c-FLIP reduction induced by JQ1.
We found that c-Myc siRNA effectively decreased c-Myc
expression, but failed to prevent c-FLIP reduction induced
by JQ1 although the basal levels of c-FLIP were elevated
by c-Myc knockdown in A549 cells (Figure 7), suggesting
that JQ1-induced c-FLIP reduction is unlikely secondary
to c-Myc upregulation in these cell lines.

DMSO or 1 µM JQ1 for 10 h. The cells were then washed with PBS 3 times and refed with fresh medium containing 10 µg/ml CHX. At the
indicated times, the cells were harvested for preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and subsequent Western blot analysis. Protein levels
were quantitated with NIH Image J software (Bethesda, MA) and were normalized to actin. The results were plotted as the relative c-FLIP
levels compared to those at the time 0 of CHX treatment (right panels).

degradation is a key mechanism that regulates c-FLIP
levels [25, 31]. In this study, inhibition of the proteasome
with MG132 rescued c-FLIP downregulation caused by
JQ1. Moreover JQ1 treatment destabilized c-FLIP proteins
by facilitating their degradation. Hence it is clear that JQ1
decreases c-FLIP levels by promoting their proteasomal
degradation.
The majority of studies to date have shown that the
therapeutic effect of BET BRD inhibitors is largely due
to targeting BRD4, rather than the other BET proteins
[2]. Since JQ1 is primarily a BRD4 inhibitor [4], it is
reasonable to ask whether inhibition of BRD4 accounts
for c-FLIP reduction induced by JQ1. Further study with
additional BET BRD inhibitors including OTX015, PFI1 and MS436 found that OTX015, but not PFI-1 and
MS436, displayed similar effects as JQ1 did in decreasing
c-FLIP levels and enhancing TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
While PFI-1 and MS436 are selective BRD4 inhibitors [9,
32], OTX015 is an inhibitor of BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4

[33]. However, OTX015 is chemically closer to JQ1
because they share similar parental chemical structures,
while PFI-1 and MS436 have relatively distinct chemical
structures (Figure 6A). Interestingly, it is OTX015, but not
PFI-1 and MS432, that functions as effectively as JQ1 in
decreasing c-FLIP levels and enhancing TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. It seems that JQ1 and OTX015 share similar
activity in modulating c-FLIP levels due to their chemical
similarity, rather than inhibition of BRD4. Suppression
of BRD4 with siRNA-mediated gene knockdown did not
result in substantial reduction of c-FLIP and enhancement
of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Instead, we observed an
increase in c-FLIP in some cell lines. Hence, the genetic
suppression of BRD4 fails to mimic the effect of JQ1 in
decreasing c-FLIP and sensitizing cancer cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis. Collectively, we conclude that JQ1
decreases c-FLIP levels and enhances TRAIL-induced
apoptosis independent of BRD4 inhibition.
While c-Myc has been suggested to be a putative

MATERIALS AND METHODS

target gene that mediates the cancer therapeutic activity
of JQ1 and other BET BRD inhibitors [2, 3, 5], increased
recent studies have suggested that these inhibitors exert
c-Myc-independent activity [2, 6, 7]. In our study, JQ1
in fact increased c-Myc levels in H157 and A549 cells
but decreased its levels in H1299 cells. This finding is
in agreement with a previous study that shows c-Myc
upregulation by JQ1 in some lung cancer cell lines [6].
Genetic suppression of c-Myc through siRNA-mediated
gene knockdown did not substantially decrease c-FLIP
levels, rather increased c-FLIP levels in some cancer cell
lines (e.g., A549 and H1299). Moreover we did not find
that genetic suppression of c-Myc mimicked the ability of
JQ1 to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore it is
unlikely that JQ1 decreases c-FLIP levels and enhances
TRAIL-induced apoptosis through c-Myc suppression.
A previous study has suggested that c-Myc
suppresses c-FLIP by directly repressing its transcription
[29]. In agreement, we found that c-Myc knockdown
indeed elevated basal levels of c-FLIP in some cell lines
(e.g., A549 and H1299). The c-Myc elevation in some cell
lines (e.g., A549 and H157) exposed to JQ1 raised the
possibility that c-FLIP reduction by JQ1 is secondary to
c-Myc upregualtion, at least in these cell lines. However,
suppression of c-Myc upregulation by knocking down
its expression failed to affect the ability of JQ1 to
decrease c-FLIP levels in both A549 and H157 cells
although it elevated basal levels of c-FLIP in A549 cells.
Combining with the data that JQ1 decreased the levels of
both c-FLIP and c-Myc in H1299 cells, we suggest that
c-FLIP reduction induced by JQ1 is unlikely due to c-Myc
upregulation either.
Hence, the mechanism by which JQ1 decrease
c-FLIP levels via facilitating their degradation has not
been elucidated in this study and thus deserves further
investigation in the future. The general mechanisms
accounting for degradation of both FLIPL and FLIPS have
not been fully elucidated by now. Our findings in this
study suggest that JQ1 can be a valuable research tool for
understanding c-FLIP degradation mechanisms.
Targeting the TRAIL/death receptor signaling
pathway with either recombinant TRAIL or agonistic
death receptor antibodies has been considered a promising
cancer therapeutic strategy and has been tested in the
clinic [20-23]. Our findings warrant further investigation
of JQ1 or OTX015 as a sensitizer of TRAIL/DR-targeted
cancer therapy in vivo and in the clinic, thus promising the
clinical translational significance of this approach.
