ABSTRACT
In this study, we investigated the effect of pre-treatment with demethylating
agent decitabine on susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs in HL60/ADR, Kasumi-1
and primary AML cells. Cytotoxic effect was increased by decitabine through activation
of p53 and inhibition of c-Myc, Survivin and Bcl-2. We demonstrated in clinic that
combination of decitabine and HAA consisting of harringtonine, aclarubicin and
cytarabine was effective and safe to treat patients with refractory, relapsed or highrisk AML. Decitabine prior to HAA regimen improved the first induction complete
response rate, and significantly prolonged overall survival and disease-free survival in
these patients compared with HAA alone. These findings support clinic protocols based
on decitabine prior to chemotherapy to overcome resistance and improve therapeutic
efficacy in AML patients.

INTRODUCTION

DNA hypomethylation leads to restore function of
methylated gene involved in cellular differentiation and
apoptosis [5]. Overexpression of DNA methyltransferase
DNMT3B is a predictor of poor survival in AML, these
patients may benefit from demethylating agent [6, 7].
Decitabine alone has limited anti-leukemia activity and
minimal extramedullary toxicity [8, 9]. It was reported
that 15.7% of AML patients achieved CR after single
decitabine treatment, and the median OS was 177 days
[4]. Synergistic cytotoxicity had been observed in AML
cells treated with cytotoxic drug and decitabine [10-12].
Limited studies demonstrated that epigenetic priming with
decitabine prior to chemotherapy was likely to increase
efficacy in AML patients with unfavorable-risk factors
[13]. However, methylated genes weren’t definite, effect
of decitabine prior to chemotherapy hasn’t been well
evaluated in clinic.

Most acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients
with adverse prognosis either fail to achieve complete
remission (CR) or relapse after short-term remission,
such as patients with complex karyotype, FLT3 mutiation,
myelodysplasia-related changes, therapy-related AML
(t-AML) [1], therapeutic options for these patients are
limited. New strategies are needed to improve therapeutic
effect in these patients. Gene silencing via DNA
methylation are frequent and reversible in high-risk AML
[2, 3], it provides the possibility to treat AML patients with
DNA-hypomethylating agent.
Hypomethylating agent decitabine is activated
intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase, the active
metabolite 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine-triphosphate inhibits
methyltransferase after incorporation into DNA [4].

In this study, we investigated the effect of
hypomethylating on susceptibility to cytotoxic drugs
in chemoresistant AML cells. Efficacy and safety of
decitabine prior to HAA regimen was evaluated in
refractory, relapsed and high-risk AML patients.

flow cytometry after cells were stained with Annexin
V-FITC/PI. Apoptosis proportion was unchanged after
1μM decitabine pretreatment in AML cells (Figure 2A).
Decitabine didn’t change drug-induced apoptosis in
HL60 cells (Figure 2B, 2C and 2D), but increased the
apoptosis in HL60/ADR cells (Figure 2E, 2F and 2G).
Apoptosis induced by these drugs except harringtonine
was enhanced in Kasumi-1 cells (Figure 2H, 2I and 2J).
It was also demonstrated that decitabine also increased
adriamycin and cytarabine induced apoptosis in most
primary AML samples (Figure 2K and 2L). The data
showed that decitabine increased drug-induced apoptosis
in chemoresistant AML cells.

RESULTS
Decitabine improves cytotoxicity of drugs in
chemoresistant AML cells
Chemoresistant AML cell lines and primary cells (n
= 6, Table 1) were treated with different concentrations
of decitabine for 72h. Dose-response curves were shown
(Figure 1A). Based on growth inhibition assay, 1μM
decitabine was used in the subsequent experiments.
Sensitivity to harringtonine, adriamycin or cytarabine
was evaluated in AML cells after decitabine pretreatment.
There was no difference in sensitivity to each drug in
HL60 cells (Figure 1B, 1C and 1D). Decitabine increased
sensitivity to harringtonine, adriamycin and cytarabine in
HL60/ADR cells (Figure 1E, 1F and 1G). Cytotoxicity
of these drugs except harringtonine was enhanced in
Kasumi-1 cells (Figure 1H, 1I and 1J). Moreover, effects
of adriamycin and cytarabine were also increased by
decitabine in primary samples from refractory AML
patients (Figure 1K and 1L). These data demonstrated
that cytotoxicity of drugs was increased by decitabine in
chemoresistant AML cells.

of harringtonine, adriamycin and cytarabine for 24h.
Cell viability and apoptosis were used to evaluate
the sensitivity to drugs. Decitabine didn’t change the
sensitivity and drugs induced apoptosis in HL60, but
increased the cytotoxicity of HAA in HL60/ADR cells and
Kasumi-1 cells (Figure 3A and 3B). The data indicated
that decitabine increased cytotoxic effect of HAA in
chemoresistant AML cells.

To confirm that apoptosis contributes to sensitization
to cytotoxic drugs, DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)
and apoptotic proteins were analyzed in HL60/ADR and
Kasumi-1 cells (Figure 4). Western blotting showed that
decitabine decreased expression of DNMT1 in both cell
lines. Transcription factor c-Myc, anti-apoptotic protein

after first induction in decitabine plus HAA was higher
than that in HAA alone (p = 0.041). There was also a good
tendency in overall CR ratio after combined treatment
although there wasn’t significance between two groups
(Table. 3).
Patients after CR continued to receive consolidation
and intensification chemotherapy alternatively in
combination with decitabine. Patients were followed up
to 36 months. The median OS was 14 months in decitabine
plus chemotherapy, and 6 months in chemotherapy alone.
The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is 8.0 and
4.8 months in each group (Figure 5A). The median DFS
were respectively 18 and 5 months in 15 patients treated
with decitabine and 10 patients without decitabine, and
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is 9.2 and
2.6 months in each group (Figure 5B). Patients treated
with decitabine had significantly longer OS (34.8%) and
DFS (40%) than those without decitabine (Both p < 0.05).

Efficacy of decitabine prior to chemotherapy
In 23 objects enrolled in decitabine plus HAA, 16
(69.6%) responded to the first course of induction therapy:
14 CR (60.9%) and 2 PR (8.7%). All subjects with PR
received the second course induction, 1 of them achieved
complete remission. It brought the overall CR was 65.2%.
24 patients were enrolled in HAA without decitabine, 11
(45.8%) responded to the first induction: 7 CR (29.2%)
and 4 PR (16.7%), 3 in 4 patients with PR achieved
remission after the second induction, and overall CR
reached 41.7% after 2 cycles of induction. The CR ratio

AML cells treated by decitabine. Proto-oncogene
c-Myc is aberrantly expressed in many solid tumors
and hematological malignancies, it is responsible for
proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis in cancer cells
[27-29]. It was also reported that c-Myc contributed to
maintenance of AML stem cells and drug-resistance [30,
31]. Overexpression of c-Myc indicates a poor prognosis
in AML patients, its inhibition was also considered as
an attractive way to overcome drug resistance [32, 33].
Our results indicated that inhibition of c-Myc increased
drug’s cytotoxicity after demethylating treatment, it
was consistent with previous studies in chronic myeloid
leukemia [34].
DNA methylation signature was indentified as a
biological distinction and conferred prognostic value in
AML [35]. Decitabine was known to reactivate methylated
genes, and emerged as an alternative in initial, salvage or

6 (40%) patients with decitabine treatment and 2 (20%)
patients without decitabine treatment were still alive in
CR after 36 months. The data supported that dacitabine
improved chemotherapeutic efficacy in refractory/relapsed
AML patients.

Safety of decitabine prior to chemotherapy
Patient’s routine blood test was done every one
or two days after chemotherapy. Neutrocytopenia
and thrombcytopemia were defined when neutrophil
count and platelet count were respectively less than
0.5×109/L and 20×109/L. Durations of neutrocytopenia
and thrombcytopemia were determined in each cycle of
chemotherapy, no significant difference was observed in
the time of neutrophil recovery or platelet recovery after
induction therapy and intensification therapy (Table.
3). The incidences of infection in two groups were also
similar after chemotherapy (Table. 3). The clinic data
indicated that decitabine plus HAA regimen was welltolerated to treat AML patients.

DISCUSSION
Overexpression of DNMT1 contributes to
pathogenesis of leukemia [18]. HL60/ADR and Kasumi-1
are multi-drug resistant AML cells with high expression
of DNMT1. In this study, we found that decitabine
depleted DNMT1, activated apoptotic signal, and
improved chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity in HL60/ADR
and Kasumi-1 cells. Decitabine prior to HAA regimen
improved CR ratio of first induction compared with HAA
alone in refractory, relapse or high-risk AML patients,
their overall CR rates weren’t different after 2 cycles of
induction therapy. However, OS and DFS were prolonged
in these patients treated by decitabine plus chemotherapy.
It was safe to treat AML patients for the same status in
myeloid suppression and infection after chemotherapy.
Aberrant DNA methylation leads to epigenetic
silencing of genes, it is also correlated with
leukemogenesis and disease relapse in AML. Silencing
genes are reactivated after hypomethylating treatment,
so decitabine is reasonable to improve chemotherapeutic
efficacy in AML [19-21]. In our study, it was
demonstrated that decitabine increased cytotoxic effect
in chemoresistant AML cells via DNA damage-associated
P53 activation and inhibition of survivin and Bcl-2. Tumor
suppressor p53 inactivation is frequently associated with
chemotherapy resistance in AML, and suppress of p53
signaling contributes to the resistance towards apoptosis
in leukemia cells [22, 23]. DNA demethylation is an
effective therapeutic strategy to restore p53 function, and
it leads to p53-correlated inhibition of survivin and Bcl-2
in cancer cells [24-26]. Our data indicated that survivin
was inhibited by overexpression of p53 in chemoresistant

consolidation therapy in AML patients [8, 36]. It was also
documented that older or relapsed patients with AML
benefited from decitabine treatment with a good toleration
[4, 37]. But single decitabine may have limited antileukemia effect in relapsed/refractory AML, the results
from retrospective studies suggested that it is possible for
decitabine in combination with chemotherapy to improve
efficacy in AML patients with unfavorable factors. A
phase I study demonstrated that epigenetic priming with
decitabine prior to standard induction was administered in
an attempt to improve the response rates in AML [13]. It
was recently reported that decitabine in combination with
G-CSF, cytarabine and aclarubicin was well-tolerated and
efficacy to treat elderly patients with AML [38]. Moreover,
clinical outcomes also indicated that combination of
decitabine and chemotherapy improved CR rate and OS
in refractory AML patients [39, 40]. But there were few
evidences in intensified therapy with decitabine in AML.
In our study, AML patients with refractory, relapsed
or high-risk factors received induction and consolidation
chemotherapy in combination with decitabine. There was
a better first induction CR rate in decitabine prior to HAA
than HAA alone, as well as a good tendency in overall CR
rate. The higher CR rate may be correlated with epigenetic
modifier decitabine prior to harringtonine, aclacinomycin
and cytarabine. The CR rate of HAA regimen was in
agreement with the previous reports in refractory/relapsed
AML with unfavourable cytogenetics [41]. AML patients
after CR continued to receive chemotherapy combined
with decitabine, the better estimated 3-year OS and DFS
indicated an encouraging survival in these AML patients.
40% AML patients with decitabine treatment were still
alive in CR after 3-year follow-up. Hypomethylating agent
had the ability to increase sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, so
decitabine prior to chemotherapy may be used as frontline,
salvage and consolidation therapy in high-risk AML
patients [36]. One concern about the combination had a
risk to prolong duration of myelosuppression. Instead,
we found that the time of neutrophil recovery or platelet
recovery in chemotherapy combined with decitabine
was similar to that in chemotherapy alone. Moreover,
no significant difference between two regimens was
detected in infection incidence. Our data indicated that
decitabine piror to chemotherapy was efficacy and safe to
treat refractory/relapsed AML patients. Other clinic trials
also demonstrated that chemotherapy alternating with
decitabine was well-tolerated and effective in older AML
patients [38, 42]. So decitabine prior to chemotherapy
may be considered as an alternative therapeutic regimen
in refractory AML patients.
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that
decitabine increased cytotoxic effect on chemoresistant
AML cells via P53 activation and inhibition of c-Myc,
survivin and Bcl-2. Decitabine prior to HAA regimen was
safe and efficacy to treat refractory/relapsed or high-risk
AML. These findings support clinic protocols based on

and improve therapeutic efficacy in AML patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human AML cell lines HL60, HL60/ADR
and Kasumi-1 (Institutes for Biological Sciences
Cell Resource Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Shanghai, China) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(Hyclone, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, NY, USA) in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. HL60/
ADR displayed 79-fold higher resistance to adriamycin
than the parental line HL60, and it was maintained with
0.1μM adriamycin (Doxorubicin) (Sigma, MO, USA)
to ensure its drug resistance. Six bone marrow samples
were obtained from patients with refractory, relapsed
or high-risk AML except M3 (Table 1), those patients
failed to achieve remission following at least 2 induction
chemotherapy, those recurred after complete remission
(<5% marrow blasts) and resisted to the re-induction
protocol, those had complex karyotype or FLT3-ITD
mutation, or AML patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22) and
c-Kit mutation [14]. Leukemia blasts in bone marrow
were over 70% in these AML patients. Mononuclear
cells were isolated by Ficoll separation and suspended in
α-MEM medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. The human
subject study was conducted under the institutional ethics
committee’s approval of Nanfang Hospital, Southern
Medical University, and written informed consent was
obtained from the patients.

Decitabine treatment
To determine decitabine dose-response curves,
HL60, HL60/ADR, and Kasumi-1 cells at density of
1×105cells/ml were treated with various concentrations of
decitabine (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) for 3 days. Viable
cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion. HL60,
HL60/ADR, Kasumi-1, and primary AML cells were
treated with 1.0 μM decitabine for 72 hours and fresh
decitabine was added daily. Treated cells were collected
and used in the following experiments.

Drug sensitivity assay
Sensitivities to harringtonine (HHT), adriamycin
(ADR) and cytarabine (Ara-C) were determined using
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) (Sigma, MO, USA) in AML cells. Briefly,
After cells were seeded into 96-well plate, different

concentrations of harringtonine, adriamycin, cytarabine
or their combination were subsequently added and
incubated for 24h. 20μL MTT solution (5mg/mL) was
added in 200μL media plus drug in each well for the last
4h of 24h culture. Absorbance was measured at 540nm
in a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Evolution 600,
China), and cell viability was calculated. Dose-response
curves were measured to evaluate cytotoxic effect.

with FLT3-ITD mutation, six was patents with MLL
rearrangement, two were AML with myelodysplasiarelated changes, three were therapy-related AML, nine
were relapsed patients, and two were patients with first
induction therapy resulting in inhibiting no more than
50% of blasts. Twenty-four patients were enrolled in
HAA without decitabine regimen with median age 39.8
(range from 18 to 58). Among them, nine patients had
poor-risk cytogenetic, three was patents with FLT3-ITD
mutation, four was patents with MLL rearrangement, one
was AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, two were
therapy-related AML, six were relapsed patients, and five
were patients without inhibiting 50% of blasts after first
induction therapy. Other characteristics of patients were
shown in Table 2. Additional inclusion criteria were as
the following: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2; normal renal and
hepatic function; life expectancy greater than 12 weeks;
and ineligibility for endure induction chemotherapy.
Exclusion criteria included the following: diagnosis of
acute promyelocytic leukemia; good-risk cytogenetics as
defined by Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria
[16]; CNS leukemia; prior therapy without decitabine and
uncontrolled infection.
Patients in decitabine plus HAA regimen were
treated in department of hematology in Nanfang Hospital,
Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China. This
study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Nanfang Hospital. Written informed consents were
obtained from the patients prior to the study.

Apoptosis assessment
HL60, HL60/ADR and Kasumi-1 cells were treated
with different concentrations of harringtonine, adriamycin,
cytarabine or their combination for 24h, as well as
primary AML cells. The treated cells were collected
and stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI (NanJing KeyGen
Biotechnology, NanJing, China), and subjected to BD flow
cytometry (Becton Dickinson, CA, USA) for apoptosis
analysis.

Immunoblot analysis
HL60/ADR, Kasumi-1 cells were treated with 1.0,
2.0, 4.0μM decitabine for 72h. Cells were harvested and
lysed in cold lysis buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mM
EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-ercaptoethanol)
containing 0.5mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.1mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), the supernatant
was collected after centrifugation (12000rpm, 10min).
The protein concentration was determined using BCA
protein determination kit (Pierce Chemical, Rockford,
IL, USA). Cell extracts were subjected to sodium
dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE), and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membranes were
blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween 20, and immunoblotted overnight at 4°C
with the appropriate primary antibody, followed by
treatment with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary
antibody. The immunocomplex was visualized using a
chemiluminescence phototope-horseradish peroxidase kit.
Antibody against β-actin (CST, MA, USA) was used to
ensure equivalent loading of whole cell protein.

Treatment
Patients in study group were subjected to infusional
decitabine (20mg/m2 for 3 days) before HAA regimen
using infusional harringtonine (2.5mg/m2 daily for 3 days,
generally the first 3 days of aclarubicin and cytarabine)
with aclarubicin (12mg/m2 daily for 7 days) and cytarabine
(100mg/m2 daily for 7 days). Patients in control group
were treated with HAA alone. Patients received supportive
care as clinically indicated, including blood transfusion,
growth factor injected hypodermically, standard antiemetic
and antimicrobial therapy. Each cycle was repeated every
4 weeks.
Subjects received subsequent therapy based on
efficacy after induction cycle. Patients with partial
remission (PR) were re-induced by decitabine plus HAA,
regular assessment was performed as before. All patients
with complete remission (CR) received one cycle of
consolidation with the same regimen as induction therapy,
then followed by four cycles of intensification therapy
alternatively using decitabine (20mg/m2 for 3 days) prior
to FA regimen (35mg/m2 fludarabine combined with 1.5g/
m2 cytarabine daily for 5 days) or high-dose (HD) Ara-C
(2g/m2 cytarabine daily for 3 days). Patients in HAA
group received the same intensification therapy without
decitabine. After one or two induction cycles, patients

Efficacy and side-effect assessment
Blood routine, liver and kidney function tests,
chest X-ray, cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms
were performed before and after treatment. Bone
marrow aspirates were performed and evaluated by local
hematopathologists after each cycle. Therapeutic efficacy
was evaluated according to International Working Group
Criteria [17]. Patients with CR required normalization of
peripheral blood counts with less than 5% blasts in bone
marrow. Patients with PR required all of the hematologic
values for CR but with a decrease of at least 50% in
the percentage of blasts to 5-25% blasts in the bone
marrow. Responsive patients were identified as patients
achieving CR or PR after induction therapy. Side-effects
of chemotherapy were graded according to WHO criteria
of grades 0 to IV. Patients had been followed up to 36
months, overall survival (OS, defined as the interval
between the date of initial treatment and the date of last
follow-up or death) and disease-free survival (DFS, time
from first CR to leukemia relapse) were calculated and
used in compared analysis.

Statistical analysis
Data from in vitro study were reported as mean
± standard deviation, and statistical significance of
difference between groups was determined by two-sided
student’s t-test. In clinic study, the primary end point was
morphologic CR, secondary end points included OS and
DFS. CR rate was calculated along with the 95% CI,
and analyzed using the Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier
product-limit estimator was used to describe OS and DFS.
Cumulative incidence of relapse was used to describe
remission duration, and death was a competing risk factor.
Statistical significance was evaluated at the 0.05 alpha
level. All analyses were performed using SPSS software
