ABSTRACT
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and its use can be
associated with severe adverse reactions, notably myocardial infarction, stroke and
drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In pursue of immune-mediated DILI mechanisms
an immunogenomic study was carried out. Diclofenac treatment of mice at 30 mg/kg
for 3 days caused significant serum ALT and AST elevations, hepatomegaly and
degenerative changes including hepatic glycogen depletion, hydropic swelling,
cholesterolosis and eosinophilic hepatocytes with one animal presenting subsegmental
infarction due to portal vein thrombosis. Furthermore, portal/periportal induction
of the rate limiting enzyme in ammonia detoxification, i.e. carbamoyl phosphate
synthetase 1 was observed. The performed microarray studies informed on > 600
differential expressed genes of which 35, 37 and 50 coded for inflammation, 51,
44 and 61 for immune and 116, 129 and 169 for stress response, respectively
after single and repeated dosing for 3 and 14 days. Bioinformatic analysis defined
molecular circuits of hepatic inflammation with the growth hormone (Ghr)− and
leptin receptor, the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, selectin and the suppressor-ofcytokine-signaling (Socs) to function as key nodes in gene regulatory networks.
Western blotting confirmed induction of fibronectin and M-CSF to hallmark tissue
repair and differentiation of monocytes and macrophages. Transcript expression
of the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure increased > 7-fold and
immunohistochemistry of CD68 evidenced activation of tissue-resident macrophages.
Importantly, diclofenac treatment prompted strong expression of phosphorylated
Stat3 amongst individual animals and the associated 8- and 4-fold Soc3 and Il-6
induction reinforced Ghr degradation as evidenced by immunoblotting. Moreover,
immunohistochemistry confirmed regulation of master regulatory proteins of
diclofenac treated mice to suggest complex pro-and anti-inflammatory reactions in
immune-mediated hepatic injury. The findings encourage translational research.

BACKGROUND

was shown that diclofenac use can be associated with
drug induced liver injury [1]. The mechanism by which
diclofenac causes liver injury remains incompletely
understood. However, some clinical and experimental data
have been put forward for an improved understanding of
hepatotoxicity [2].

Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID) and an antipyretic commonly used in the
treatment of inflammatory disorders, rheumatoid arthritis
and chronic pain associated with cancer. Repeatedly it

Specially, diclofenac is extensively metabolized
to 4′-OH and 5′-OH diclofenac by the Cyp2c9 and
Cyp3a4 monooxygenase system and may also involve
increased production of reactive metabolites, most
notable diclofenac-2,5- and 1,4-quinone imines. Reactive
metabolites can be a leading cause of liver injury,
particularly if not sufficiently detoxified via the glutathione
redox and conjugation system. Notwithstanding secondary
quinone imine metabolites derived from 5-OH and 4′-OH
diclofenac glutathione conjugates may be eliminated via
biliary excretion especially when bile salt homeostasis
is altered. Diclofenac is also metabolized to 4′-OH
diclofenac (DCF) acyl glucuronide by the combined
activity of CYP2C8 and UGT2B7 in humans and Ugt2b1
in rats. The reactive metabolites are electrophilic and
protein-diclofenac adducts have been identified [3].
Additionally, diclofenac acyl glucuronides may
accumulate in liver and blood plasma due to saturated drug
transport into the biliary canaliculi, and polymorphisms
in some ATP-binding cassette transporters (Mrp2, Mrp3
and Bcrp1) are associated with cholestatic liver disease as
reported for this drug [4].
In vitro, diclofenac induced apoptosis through
mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in rat
and human hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines [5]
and Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP) was shown to be a major
mechanism of diclofenac-induced hepatotoxicity in a
human hepatoma cell line [6, 7]. Moreover, diclofenac
inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation
induced by tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), to result in
apoptosis in human and mouse hepatoma cell lines [8]. In
rats, a non-hepatotoxic dose of diclofenac co-administered
with small amounts of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused
hepatotoxicity and modest inflammation induced by LPS
sensitized hepatocytes to a non-toxic dose of diclofenac
[9]. In this regard a T helper 17 cell (Th17)-related
immune response was reported in diclofenac-induced
acute liver injury in mice [10].
In patient serum samples several protein-adducts
of diclofenac and antibodies to diclofenac metabolites
were identified. Furthermore, polymorphisms in the
gene coding for Il-10, Il-4 and Il-4r were associated with
diclofenac hepatotoxicity and its outcome [11]. According
to clinical research, cholestasis and transient circulating
autoantibodies are seen in patients who suffered from
acute and chronic hepatitis due to diclofenac [12] and
with some patients an autoimmune response was seen after
cessation of diclofenac treatment [2, 13], [http://livertox.
nlm.nih.gov/Diclofenac.htm]. All these studies suggest
an immune mechanism as part of the pathogenesis of
diclofenac’s idiosyncratic toxicity.
Here we hypothesized for diclofenac a mechanism
of hepatotoxicity involving inflammatory reactions.
Thus our research focused on an evaluation of acute and
repeated treatment responses for up to 14 days. We were
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

particularly interested in identifying molecular circuits
of inflammatory response genes and employed whole
genome microarrays, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry
as well as Western blotting to evidence regulation of key
molecules in affected livers.

RESULTS
Serum markers of liver injury and
histopathology findings
The serum markers AST, ALT, ALP and total
bilirubin (TBIL) were studied after single and repeated
treatment, i.e. days 1, 3 and 14. A statistically significant
increase in AST and ALT and a reduction in ALP activities
(Figure 1) were observed after i.p. administration of
diclofenac at 30 mg/kg; however, bilirubin did not differ
when control and treatment groups were compared. There
was significant variability amongst individual animals to
suggest difference in response with some animals being
less able to adapt to this treatment regime as was observed
after repeated treatment for 14 days (see Figure S1 for
individual blood biochemistry data).
To explore dose dependent changes in serum
markers of liver injury mice were also treated at 150 mg/kg
for up to 3 days. However, a dose dependent change in
AST, ALT and ALP activities could not be established as
measurements were highly variable amongst individual
animals. Moreover, at this dose acute liver failure/death
was observed in two out of four animals and additional
treatment of two mice caused fatal liver injury in one
and acute liver failure in another one. Thus the study was
terminated after 48 h of diclofenac treatment.
Diclofenac treatment caused a significant increase in
the liver to body weight ratio (Table 1) and histopathology
revealed dose dependent glycogen depletion after single
and repeated treatment for up to 3 days (Figure 2).
Conversely, hepatic glycogen was only modestly
changed after repeated dosing for 14 days (image not
shown) to possibly suggest adaptation to diclofenac
treatment. Individual animals differed in their responses,
nonetheless the Hematoxylin-eosin stain revealed
hydropic swelling of heptocytes (Figure 2, Panel A).
With some animals repeated diclofenac treatment induced
hepatic cholesterolosis (“foamy cytoplasm”) and one
animal presented infarct necrosis as a result of portal vein
thrombosis (Figure 2, Panel D). Although serum bilirubin
laboratory values were within normal range and alkaline
phosphatase activity was significantly reduced (Figure 1)
the bile ducts in some of the treated animals were dilatated
and congested with bile to indicate early signs of bile duct
obstruction (Figure 2, panel C, PAS stain illustrating a
dilatated and bile fluid filled canaliculi).
A range of immunohistochemistry studies were
performed with CD31 evidencing sinusoidal endothelial
cells to be intact (not shown), however hepatic sinusoids
14984

appeared partially widened. Likewise, the increased staining
for CD68 (Figure 3A) marked activated Kupffer cells and
appeared to be co-stimulated by the enhanced secretion of
the cytokine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)
as observed for the centrolobular regions (Figure 3B).
Equally, the pronounced sinusoidal and occasionally
strong hepatic expression of the acute phase protein
lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) reinforces the
notion of Kupffer cell activation (Figure 4). Note, LBP is
bound by CD14 and transcript expression of this pattern
recognition receptor was > 30-fold induced (see Table S9).
Further evidence for proliferation of sinusoidal resident
antigen-presenting cells was obtained by examining Ki67.
An increase in Ki67 positive cells was observed (Figure 5)
and it is well established that activated Kupffer cells
release cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species
and other mediators of inflammation. As the activation
of resident macrophages was not confined to regions of
harmed hepatocytes diclofenac treatment induced a more
general response by augmenting drug induced hepatitis.
Alike, the significant regulation of the T-cell protein
tyrosine phosphatase (Tc-PTP; Figure 6) is an important
finding. Tc-PTP is a key player of the immune system and a
negative regulator of Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF-1)
signalling and macrophage differentiation. Note, CSF-1
was significantly repressed in transcript expression by nearly
40% in livers of diclofenac treated mice (see Table S2).

Moreover, enhanced expression of fibronectin, i.e.
a matrix glycoprotein known to influence hepatic survival
was strongly upregulated particularly at the 150 mg/kg
dose to signify tissue repair (Figure 7, Panel D). Besides,
we investigated regulation of the growth hormone receptor
(Ghr, Figure 8) and found its expression to be significantly
increased in the sinusoids especially of periportal and
intermediate regions localised hepatocytes after single
treatment (day 1), however Ghr staining was markedly
reduced after repeated treatment for 3 days. Importantly,
growth hormone signals through Ghr and is known to play
a decisive role in liver regeneration. Moreover, diclofenac
treatment induced enhanced sinusoidal expression of
the leptin receptor (Figure 9); its infrequently increased
expression by harmed hepatocytes was also observed.
In addition, we investigated the expression of Hep Par 1
(Figure S2) and noted strong cytoplasmic staining of
hepatocytes in diclofenac treated animals, however the
centrolobular regions were spared. It was demonstrated
that Hep Par 1 recognizes the urea cycle rate limiting
enzyme carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1. Hence, we
evidence ammonia detoxification and observed strong
focal staining of hepatocytes surrounding the portal tracts
(see day 3, 30 mg/kg). Enhanced expression of the antigen
was also observed with disperse hepatocytes as seen at
the 150 mg treatment dose (Figure S2, Panel C). Finally,
we examined the possibility of liver architectural changes

several genes were regulated in common coding for
inflammatory, immune, stress and acute-phase response.
Both of the softwares employed, i.e. GeneXplain and
GenPlex informed on the significant regulation of
the inflammatory, immune and stress response genes
(Table S2), even though the total number of DEGs differed
when the Welch and/or hypergeometric statistical test were
applied.

Genomic response of the liver to diclofenac
treatment
RNA was extracted from livers of vehicle- and
diclofenac (30 mg/kg)-treated mice after single, i.e. 24 h
and repeated dosing for 72 h and 14 days. Because of
the sudden death of two animals at the 150 mg/kg dose
the livers from high dose animals were not used for
the microarray experiments. Gene expression profiling
of RNA samples was performed with the Affymetrix
GeneChip System. Initially, the data were analysed with
the GenPlex software version 3.0 [http://genplex.co.kr]
and a total of 295 and 467 significantly regulated genes
at >1.5-fold change and statistical significance testing
(Welch’s t-test, p < 0.05) were determined after single and
repeated treatment for 3-days. Additionally, the microarray
data were analysed with the GeneXplain software version
3.0 [http://platform.genexplain.com/bioumlweb]. Here a
total of 471 (293 up- and 178 down-) and 564 (353 up- and
211 down-) DEGs were determined after single and
repeated treatment for 3 days, of which 132 genes were
(89 up- and 43 down-) regulated in common amongst
both datasets (see Figure 10A.1 and Table 2A). Besides,
the 14 day repeated diclofenac treatment revealed
666 (455 up- and 211 down-) differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) of which 74 were common when data
from day 1, 3 and 14 were compared (Figure  10A.2
and Table 2B). Next, a heat map was generated using
the average-linkage hierarchical clustering and the
Euclidean distance algorithm. As shown in Figure 10B

Regulation of transporters and drug metabolism
genes
As diclofenac is extensively metabolized we
initially assessed the regulation of genes coding for
CYP enzymes and transporters. The microarray study
revealed Cyp26a1, Cyp2a4, Cyp2a5, Cyp3a13, Cyp2b9,
Cyp2c40 and Cyp2c55 to be significantly regulated
after single treatment. Likewise, repeated treatment for
up to 14 days caused significant regulations of Cyp7a1,
Cyp39A1, Cyp2c39, Cyp3a44 and Cyp3a13. Note, Cyp7a1
catalyses the hydroxylation of cholesterol during bile acid
synthesis and was significantly up-regulated after repeated
treatment; nonetheless genes coding for transporters were
more frequently changed than those involved in drug
metabolism and included major mitochondrial solute
carriers (Table S3).

Top bio-functions of genes influenced by
diclofenac treatment
The GeneXplain and GenPlex software defined
the top biological processes of DEGs with significant

(see Tables S7 and S8). Significantly enriched ontology
terms were mainly associated with inflammatory
response, gastrointestinal disease, organism injury/

abnormalities and renal/urological disease after single
treatment. Similarly, the genomic responses after
repeated treatment involved inflammation, infectious
and inflammatory disease as well as respiratory and
hematological disorders with several of the inflammatory
response genes being equally regulated after single and

30 mg/kg) and repeated diclofenac treatment of mice (day 3, 150 mg/kg). With control animals the nuclei of hepatocytes appeared quiescent
and the cytoplasm of hepatocytes is rich in glycogen (“cloudy”). With treated animals hydropic cytoplasmic swelling of hepatocytes and
occasionally eosinophilic hepatocytes are observed (upper left corner, 150 mg/kg animal). The nuclei are activated and the nucleoli are
enlarged. The degenerative changes are more pronounced at the higher dose (magnification 200x). (B) from the left to the right: PAS staining of
vehicle control and single (day 1) diclofenac treatment at 30 and 150 mg/kg. When compared to vehicle controls a significant reduction in the
intense PAS staining of hepatocytes was observed to suggest hepatic depletion of glycogen as a result of diclofenac treatment (magnification
100x). (C) from the left to the right: PAS staining of vehicle control and after repeated diclofenac treatment (day 3) at 30 and 150 mg/kg. Similar
to Panel B and when compared to controls the PAS stain revealed significant depletion of the hepatic glycogen content. Note, the dilatated

Furthermore, significantly enriched ontology terms
related to molecular and cellular functions were cellular

cellular movement, cell-to-cell signalling/interaction,
antigen presentation, lipid metabolism and molecular
transport were top functions after repeated treatment.
In the category physiological system, development

common ontology terms involved the hematological

and immune cell trafficking.

phosphate, aminosugar, fructose and mannose metabolism.
The signalling pathways were related to cellular immune
responses, cytokine signalling, humoral immune
responses, disease-specific pathway and the ingenuity
toxicity list (Figure S3, Panel A). After repeated treatment
the top 10 signalling pathways were concerned largely
with apoptosis, cardiovascular signalling, cellular immune
responses, cytokine signalling, disease-specific pathways,
the ingenuity toxicity list, nuclear receptor signalling, and
organismal growth development (Figure S3, Panel B).
Among the altered pathways, immune-related
signalling was commonly affected and involved genes
coding for Orm1, Orm2, Apcs, Serpina3, Stat3, and Lbp,
along with Saa2 and Saa4. Additionally, interleukin
signalling appeared in the canonical pathway analysis and
involved genes coding for Stat3, Socs3, Il-33, Il1r1 and
the chemokines Cxcl3 and Cxcl13.

regulatory molecules Lepr, Lcn2, Nfkbiz, Socs3, Apcs
and Ctla4 were also significantly regulated in the fused
network amongst all treatments.

type 2 (Ptpn2) as master regulators; their associated
networks accounted for 140, 142 and 146 of
significantly regulated DEGs or > 57% of total DEGs,
respectively, after single treatment. Similarly, after
repeated treatment > 50% of DEGs were connected
in networks that consisted of the master regulators
leptin receptor (Lepr), selectin (Sele) and suppressor
of cytokine signalling 3 (Socs3). Moreover, common
DEGs after single and repeated treatment for 3 days
were grouped into networks with the leptin receptor,
lipocaline 2 (Lcn2) and Nfkb as central acting
molecules and accounted for 50% of significantly
regulated DEGs. After 14 days of treatment the serum
amyloid P-component (Apcs), CD44 antigen (Cd44)
and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4
(Ctla4) were defined as master regulators and involved
31% of DEGs in their associated networks. Note, the
genes coding for the master regulators were likewise
significantly regulated (see Table 3).
To search for cross-talk amongst individual
regulatory gene networks an integrated network was
constructed and 31%, 28% and 15% of DEGs were

Validation studies by qRT-PCR, western blotting
and immunohistochemistry
Initially, a total of eight genes were selected with
minor to moderate changes in gene expression to confirm
their regulation by an independent method and except for
Stat3, Fas and Ror-a there was agreement amongst both
platforms in determining significant differences between
control and diclofenac treated animals (Figure 11A). The
regulation of genes coding for master regulators was also
studied by qRT-PCR and the results are given in Figure 11B.
Because of the variable responses amongst individual
animals statistical significance could not be established
even though some of the master regulators were > 10-fold
induced and the coded protein were significantly upregulated (see WB experiments below). Next regulation of

cytokines was investigated by qRT-PCR (see Figure 11C
and Table S9 for regulated cytokines and cluster of
differentiation molecules found to be regulated by
diclofenac) and trend wise the microarray and qRT-PCR
data agreed; however, the data were more variable in
qRT-PCR assays. Diclofenac treatment caused significant
hepatic glycogen depletion (see hepatic PAS staining
Figure 2B and 2C); we therefore studied regulation
of genes involved in glycogenesis and carbohydrate
metabolism. This revealed the genes hexokinase 1 (Hk1)
and enolase 1 (Eno1) to be moderately but significantly
regulated. Specifically, Hk1 catalyses the production of
glucose-6-phosphate, a rate limiting step in mitochondrial
glycolysis as well as Eno1, which determines the
conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate
(see Figure S8).
Next Western immunoblotting studies were
performed to reveal significant regulation of fibronectin,
growth hormone receptor (oppositely on day 1 and 3)
and M-CSF (Figure 12A and 12B) and although pSTAT3
expression was highly induced among individual animals
it failed statistical significance testing. The extremely

large scattering of phospho-Stat3 might be due to some
oscillation in the phosphorylation of Stat3 with animals
not being synchronised in the circadian rhythm. After
single diclofenac treatment, a small but statistically
significant induction of TC-PTP was observed (see Figure
12A and 12B) while Western blotting of master regulatory
molecules after repeated diclofenac treatment for 14 days
identified CD44, CTLA4 and APCS to be up-regulated;
however only the latter two proteins reached statistical
significance (Figure 12C).
The expression of master regulatory molecules was
also studied by immunohistochemistry as detailed above.

STRING PPI networks
Protein-protein interactions (PPI) were determined
with the String software version 9.1. Overall, 48% of
DEGs had proven PPIs after single and/or repeated
treatment and therefore interact with each other. As
diclofenac treatment influenced the expression of genes
associated with inflammation, immune and stress response
(see Table S2) individual PPI networks were constructed;

as shown in Figures 13A–15A the total numbers of PPIs
were 749, 687, 1043 after single and repeated treatment
for 3 and 14 days, respectively. Furthermore, the numbers
of PPIs within the inflammation, immune and stress
response networks were 75, 107 and 282 after single (see
Figure 13B–13D) and 89, 74, 256 after repeated treatment
for 3 days (see Figure 14B–14D). Likewise, diclofenac
treatment for 14 days was associated with 92, 96 and 413
PPIs, respectively (see Figure 15B–15D).

stress response genes was investigated and included
computational analysis using position weight matrices
available in the TRANSFAC database in addition to
entrained genetic algorithms (see Table S10–S12). After
single treatment and among 35 inflammatory responsive
genes 28, 27, 34, 29, 23 and 17 were significantly enriched
for Cebpd, Rbpjk, Gre, Gata, P300 and Pparg transcription
factor binding sites, respectively (see Figure 13B)
whereas at gene specific promoters of Orm2, Cxcl1,

DEGs was computed and revealed significantly enriched
Gata, Gfi1, Nf1, Cebpa and Dr1 transcription factor
binding sites (Figure S9). Previous research already
identified C/EBP proteins to play a major role in the
inflammatory response. After repeated treatment for
14 days inflammatory response genes involved the Coup1,
Gata1, Vdr, Cdpcr1, Fxr and Ar transcription factors
(Figure 15B). Conversely, promoters of the immune
response genes were significantly enriched for Tcf11, Gre,
Ppara, Gata4, Plzf and Ets TF binding sites after single
(Figure 13C) and Ttf1, Gre, Pax8, Hnfalpha, Vdr and E12
after repeated treatment for 3 days (Figure 14C). Likewise,
after 14 days of treatment the composite module consisted
of the transcription factors Pebp2b (Cbfb), Tfe, Hnf4,
Tcf11 and Ar (Figure 15C).
When promoters of stress response regulated genes
were interrogated the composite modules consisted
of Cebpa, Gre, Wt1, Vdr and Cdpcr1 after single (see
Figure 13D) and Cebp, Dbp, Sp3, Gre, Ik and Ipf1
after repeated treatment for 3 days (Figure 14D). After
14 days of treatment a composite module was constructed
and consisted of Blimp1, Pbx1, Aml1, Gata4 and Ipf1
transcription factors (Figure 15D). Note, the frequency

of transcription factor binding sites in promoters of
inflammatory, immune and stress response genes is given
in Tables S13–S15.

Studies with mouse hepatocyte cultures
Whole genome gene expression profiling of
diclofenac treated primary mouse hepatocytes cultures
revealed 2663 (1371 up- and 1292 down-) DEGs with
the fold change of > 2 and p-value cut off of < 0.01.
Furthermore, the comparison of in vitro and in vivo
data (day 1, 3 and 14) defined 20 genes to be regulated
in common (see Figure S10), however Cxcl1, Dnajc12,
Hp, Hsd3b5, Icam1, Il-33, Ly6e, Marco, Nfkbiz, Saa4,
Serpina10, Steap4 and Tmem176a were oppositely
regulated when compared to in vivo findings (Table S16).

DISCUSSION
Diclofenac is a commonly prescribed NSAID for
the treatment of pain and inflammation; however, its use
is associated with adverse drug reaction most notable
increased risk for arterial thrombotic event that prompted

new safety advice by the European Medicines Agency in
2013. Apart from cardiovascular complications its use is
also associated with significant gastrointestinal toxicity
and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) of different grades
including rare but life-threatening acute liver failures that
required liver transplantation as determined in a recently
published retrospective study involving 52 centres across
7 European countries [14]. A newly published study on
the incidence, presentation and outcome in patients of the
general population of Iceland also revealed diclofenac
to rank second amongst drugs causing DILI [15] while
histopathology findings of clinical cases are suggestive for
an immune allergic reaction type in diclofenac DILI cases.
In an effort to define immune-mediated mechanisms
of hepatotoxicity we investigated genomic responses
in livers of mice after single and repeated diclofenac
treatment. This revealed key molecular processes whereby
diclofenac elicits an inflammatory, acute phase and
immune response. Our findings agree with the general
notion on diclofenac hepatotoxicity whereby reactive
metabolites and immune mediated mechanisms lead to
liver injury [16].
Specifically, the potential to cause liver injury
in mice was investigated at diclofenac doses of 50,
80, and 120 mg/kg with serum transaminase activity
being significantly increased at 80 and 120 mg/kg after
24 hours of treatment [10]. In this study diclofenacinduced liver injury was associated with regulation
of Il-1ß and in vivo blocking/neutralization of Il-1ß

activity with an inhibitory antibody ameliorated
liver injury to suggest IL-1β to be involved in the
pathogenesis of liver injury. In the present study and at
the lower dose of 30 mg/kg body weight Il-1ß was also
significantly up-regulated (nearly 3-fold) after 14 days
of treatment (see Table S9). At this dose significant
changes in serum ALT, AST and ALP activities were
observed, however 150 mg/kg induced mortality and acute
liver failure. Therefore, our study evidences acute lethality
at significantly lower doses to the previously reported
LD50 of 345 mg/kg [TOXNET Database: http://chem.sis.
nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/rn/15307-86-5].
Owing to its extensive metabolism we initially
assessed regulation of genes coding for drug metabolism
and transport, however observed only minor, yet
statistically significant changes after diclofenac treatment
(see Table S3). Furthermore, the expression of Sod2 was
decreased in diclofenac-treated livers and this enzyme
transforms toxic superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and
oxygen in mitochondria. Decreased expression levels of
Sod2 are associated with oxidative stress as was shown in
a previous performed hepatocyte cell culture study where
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased
upon diclofenac treatment [5].
Diclofenac treatment induced innate and adaptive
immune responses [10, 17–19] as demonstrated in the
present study by the regulation of various chemokines

(see Table S2). Specifically, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl13
facilitate recruitment of neutrophils, leukocytes, and B
lymphocytes to sites of injury whereas Xcl1 and Ccl6
support differentiation of myeloid cells and CD8+ T cells
[20, 21]. Increased expression of Il-7 by hepatocytes
controls T cell responses [21] while Il-15 regulates the
activation and proliferation of T cells and natural killer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(NK) cells [22]. Additionally, Il-33 was up-regulated and
this member of the Il-1 superfamily stimulates production
of type 2 cytokines by T helper cells [23]. Thus, diclofenac
treatment resulted in an increased expression of cytokines
to influence T cell differentiation. According to the
danger hypothesis, a danger signal is induced by immune
responses to antigens as well as the interaction of pro15002

inflammatory cytokines and polarizing cytokines [24] and
in the case of diclofenac involved regulation of Tlr2, Tlr13
and the apoptosis related genes Fas, Tnfrsf1a, Myd88,
and Nfkbiz. The Chi3l3 gene was highly expressed, and
this protein is known to be released from macrophages
during inflammation. Diclofenac also induced S100a8
and S100a9 transcript expression and increased levels of
the proteins hallmark numerous pathological conditions
associated with inflammation [25].
Furthermore, the expression of acute phase
response genes was up-regulated in response to
diclofenac treatment. Acute phase proteins are produced
by hepatocytes and controlled by cytokines such as Il-1β,
Tnf-α, Ifnγ, and Il-6 [26]. According to the study of Yano
et al., 2012 [10] expression of Il-1 is highest at 3 h, but
expression of Tnf-α peaked at 24 h in diclofenac-treated
mouse liver (80 mg/kg, i.p.) [11].
Additionally, Stat3 is known to be a transcription factor
activated by cytokines and growth factors and plays a key role

in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis.
In hepatocytes, Stat3 is directly involved in the transcription
of acute phase proteins by stimulating Il-6 and interaction with
Nfkb1 [26]. In the present study, phosphorylated Stat3 was
highly induced in some of the treated animals (see Figure 12)
and this protein controls transcription of Socs3 which
functions as an inhibitor of Jak/Stat3 signalling [27]. Notably,
Socs3 supports differentiation of the Th17 and is implicated
in autoimmune disease and a recent study reported that the
expression of Th17 cell-mediated factors such as ROR-γt,
and Stat3 increased significantly in diclofenac-treated mouse
liver [10].
Taken collectively, the release of proinflammatory
cytokines by diclofenac stimulates cytokine receptor
activation. Moreover, Stat3, which is activated by cytokine
signalling, induces expression of acute phase proteins
and differentiation of T cells and this feedback-loop is
controlled by Socs3 [28]. Expression of Il4ra and IL13ra1
was also increased in response to diclofenac treatment; the

coded proteins are known to activate Jak/Stat6 signalling
through binding of Il-4 and Il-13 [29]. Therefore, the Jak/
Stat, PPAR, adipocytokine and chemokine signalling
pathways were significantly influenced after single and
repeated diclofenac treatment.

Tc-PTP was modestly but significantly up-regulated as
determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. The present
study also identified E-selectin as a master regulator whose
decisive roles in placing leukocytes to the site of injury
during inflammation has been documented [45]. The
increased expression of Lcn2 is of clinical significance
and is associated with activation of neutrophils as seen
in inflammation and oxidative stress conditions [46]. It is
also strongly induced in hepatocytes and adipocytes, both
in vitro and in vivo by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
as interleukin-1ß and tumour necrosis factor alpha and was
induced by diclofenac treatment [47].
Network analysis of 14 day repeated diclofenac
treatment data revealed the cytotoxic T lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 (Ctla4) as master regulator; note, the
coded protein is a key element in the immune system to
induce immune tolerance and is one of the critical negative
regulators of the T cell-mediated immune response.
Furthermore, Ctla4 gene polymorphism is a risk factor
for drug induced liver injury [48] and is associated with
autoimmune liver diseases including primary biliary
cirrhosis [49]. Ctla4-mediated signal transduction was
also reported to induce cell death in previously activated T
cells and abnormal expression of Ctla4 can be associated
with varies pathologies including chronic immune
diseases as well as malignancies [50]. Likewise, the
serum amyloid P-component (Sap or Apcs) is a major
acute phase protein that is synthesized in response to
pro-inflammatory cytokines and binds to DNA to
modulate immune responses [51]. It was reported
that hepatic Apcs gene expression is enhanced during
inflammation [52, 53].
Lastly, network analysis revealed Cd44 as a master
regulator which we found highly but variably regulated
amongst individual animals (Figure 12). This membrane
bound receptor functions in the regulation of several
biological processes including adhesion, migration, invasion,
survival and inflammation [54] and plays a role in a variety
of inflammatory responses, including the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and the migration of macrophages
and neutrophils [55, 56]. Binding of hyaluronic acid to Cd44
promotes the interaction with a number of other cell surface
proteins, for instance Tlr4 and Egfr, and influences the
activity of a variety of downstream protein kinase signalling
pathways (MAP kinase and Akt pathways) [57]. It was also
reported that Cd44 provides a critical link between cellular
metabolic changes and the development of inflammation as
well as insulin resistance in liver [58].

Molecular circuits of inflammation
The network analysis defined several master
regulators, i.e. the leptin receptor, Ghr, Ptpn2, Socs3,
Sele, Lcn2, Nfkbiz, Ctla4, Apcs and Cd44 after single
and repeated diclofenac treatment. Four of the master
regulators (Lepr Ghr, Ptpn2 and Socs3) directly interact
with Stat3 to significantly influence the constructed gene
networks. As described above, Stat3 is rapidly activated
by various cytokines and growth factors including Il-6,
EGF family members and hepatocyte growth factor as part
of an immune response and inflammation [30-32]. This
factor intercede regulation of several pro-inflammatory
(Mapks, p38, Jnk, and IκB kinase) and anti-inflammatory
(Pi3k-Akt) signalling cascades as had been observed in
LPS treated mice [25, 33]. Another factor significantly
up-regulated in response to diclofenac treatment was
leptin and this 16-kDa adipokine plays a key role in
energy intake to influence monocyte/ macrophagemediated responses during inflammation [34]. Several
studies suggest leptin to be a pro-inflammatory molecule
whereby the leptin receptor directly or indirectly
modulates signalling pathways involved in kinaseinduced phosphorylation by Jak2/Stat3, Erbb2, Erk, Irsl
and Rho/Rac [35]. This cytokine interacts with Socs3,
i.e. another master regulator of the repeated diclofenac
treatment network; its interaction with Stat3 constitutes a
negative feedback loop on leptin receptor activity [36, 37].
Several of the pro-inflammatory cytokines found to be upregulated in the present study also induce expression of
Socs3 and this protein is an important master regulator that
can be activated by STAT and nuclear factor κΒ (NF κΒ)mediated pathways [38].
The growth hormone receptor is another master
regulator identified in the network analysis and plays
a major role in response to tissue injury [39, 40].
Importantly, the growth hormone and leptin receptors are
influenced by multiple intracellular signalling cascades,
including Jak-Stat pathway [41] and chemokine signalling
pathway found to be regulated in the present study (Hck,
Ncf1, Stat3, Nfkb1, and Cxcl1) and are a part of the hepatic
inflammatory response [42] to suppress hepatic Ghr
signalling [43]. Specifically, GHR protein expression was
reduced at day 3 of diclofenac treatment thus evidencing
its degradation (see Figure 12).
Additionally, the protein tyrosine phosphatase
(Ptpn2) was identified as a master regulator and it’s
regulation by diclofenac is of particular importance in the
modulation of interferon gamma signal transduction as
part of the inflammatory pathway [44]. In the present study
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Co-occupancy of transcription factor binding
sites
Regulatory gene networks were interrogated
by analysing transcription factor binding sites at gene
specific promoters. Eventually, composite modules were
computed after single and repeated treatments. A notable
15008

Oncotarget

finding is the vitamin D receptor (Vdr), i.e. a transcription
factor that was significantly regulated in either composite
module after single and repeated diclofenac treatment
regimens. Several independent studies implicate Vdr
in the inflammatory response [59–61] and in the innate
and adaptive immune system [62–64] by regulating the
production of inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the
proliferation of pro-inflammatory cells, both of which
are crucial for the pathogenesis of inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases. Moreover, Vdr polymorphisms are
associated with risk and severity of liver diseases such
as primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis and
hepatocellular carcinoma [65, 66].
Besides, the transcription factor and master
regulator glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) is strongly
implicated in the regulation of inflammatory, immune and
stress response genes after single and repeated diclofenac
treatment with most of the inflammatory response genes
being bona fide targets for Gre and Nfkb [67, 68].
Furthermore, the CCAAT/enhancer-binder protein
(C/EBP) families of transcription factors (i.e. Cebpd
and Cebpa) play an important role in the transcriptional
regulation of inflammatory and stress response genes
[69]; thus a complex interplay exists by which Tnfalpha, Il-1, nuclear factor κB, activator protein-1, early
growth response protein-1 and C/EBPs to intensify the
inflammatory response [70] with Cebpß and d isoforms
being up-regulated while Cebpa was down regulated in
response to inflammation [33]. The co-occupancy TF
analysis also revealed GATA factors to take part in the
inflammatory and stress response after single and repeated
diclofenac treatment. Among the GATA Zn-finger proteins
isoforms 1 to 3 play major roles in the hematopoietic and
immune system [71] whereas Gata4 and Gata6 participate
in the control of liver-specific gene expression as was
shown by Mwinyi et al., 2010 [72]. It was reported that
Gata2 and 3 engage in protein complexes with Cebpa/
Cebpß to jointly suppress adipocyte differentiation [73].
In addition, the liver-specific transcription factors Hnf1a
and Hnf4a are part of the constructed inflammatory and
immune composite modules and play a crucial role in the
regulation of metabolism including bile acid, cholesterol
and lipoprotein metabolism as well as glucose and fatty
acid metabolism by maintaining hepatocyte differentiation
[74–76]. During inflammation the metabolic competence
of the liver is greatly affected and involves altered
nuclear receptor activity, cross-talk amongst different
cell types including macrophages, B and T cells, cytokine
signalling and cytokine mediated activity of liver enriched
transcription factors to influence liver regeneration,
apoptosis, and liver-specific gene regulation as had been
reviewed by us [74, 77, 78].
Moreover,
repeated
diclofenac
treatment
elicited regulation of the P53 tumour suppressor. This
transcription factor is activated in response to different

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cellular stresses including DNA damage and hypoxia and
mediates a variety of anti-proliferative processes [79].
The interaction of p53 with the transcription co-activators
p300 (see Figure 14B) and CREB-binding protein (CBP)
enhances its ability to bind and activate transcription
of target genes [80]. Likewise, Ppar is a part of the
composite module constructed after single diclofenac
treatment and the Ppar family transcription factors can
be activated by numerous fatty-acid metabolites that are
produced during the inflammatory response. In vivo and
in vitro studies evidence PPAR signalling pathway to be
significantly regulated in diclofenac treated mice [81] and
Ppary is involved in negative regulation of Il-6 mediated
acute phase response in hepatocytes. The transcription
factors Ppary and Cebpa are both inferred in the stress
and inflammatory response composite modules after
single diclofenac treatment and are known to promote
adipocyte differentiation [82] with Ppary regulating the
expression of a number of genes involved in peroxisomal
and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. Similarly,
Lxr has been characterized as regulator of macrophage
inflammatory pathways and is a part of the constructed
inflammatory response composite module after repeated
diclofenac treatment for day 3.
Therefore, coordinate regulations of Ppar and Lxr
transcription factors and glucocorticoid receptor have
been proposed to integrate local and systemic responses
to inflammation [83, 84]. Recent studies also highlight the
role of chromatin higher order structure in the regulation
of inflammatory gene expression and specifically the p300
co-activator protein. This histone acetylase functions
through various interaction domains such as the RID,
KIX, the interferon response binding domain and p53
with transcription factors defined in the inflammatory and
immune response networks (see Figure 14B). A further
member of the constructed composite module is Rbp-j,
i.e. a DNA binding protein that plays a key role in signal
transduction during myeloid cell differentiation by the
Notch signalling pathway [85, 86].
The farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) was regulated by
diclofenac and apart from its role in bile acid homeostasis
it also functions in triglycerides, cholesterol and
carbohydrate metabolism during the acute phase response
[87]. It was shown earlier that pro-inflammatory cytokines
induce Fxr activity during infection and inflammation,
accompanied by abnormalities in lipid metabolism that
are similar to those seen in common disorders, such as
diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome [88, 89].
A further transcription factor of the inflammatory
and immune response composite module with eminent
importance in liver biology is the androgen receptor
(Ar); altered Ar signalling is observed in various liver
diseases including steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma [90] and was shown to play a suppressive role
on liver gene expression during inflammation. In addition,

15009

Oncotarget

exaggerated Ar activity may promote hepatocarcinogenesis
via increased cellular oxidative stress, DNA damage/
repair and cell apoptosis [91, 92].
Lastly, our network analysis of diclofenac induced
immune response genes inferred regulation of the Tcf11/
Nrf1 transcription factor and the protein is known to
influence expression of genes involved in glutathione
(GSH) biosynthesis and other oxidative defence enzymes.
Importantly, knockout of the gene in the liver of mice
caused increased inflammation, apoptosis and spontaneous
development of hepatic cancer [93]. The transcription
factor Tfe3 is part of day14 immune response composite
module and plays a major role in activation of the immune
system [94] and the regulation of glucose metabolism in
liver [95].

portal vein of N = 3 mice was cannulated with a 22-gauge
plastic cannula and the liver was perfused with a Krebs
Ringer buffer (pH 7.4) containing glucose (10 mM) and
Hepes (10 mM), at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The liver
was subsequently perfused with a collagenase solution
(Calcium containing Krebs Ringer Buffer with glucose)
for 10–15 min. Hepatocytes were isolated by removing
the capsule and filtering through the cell strainer. Isolated
hepatocytes were washed three times with ice cold DMEM
containing 10% FBS and hepatocytes of > 90% viability
were obtained by using the Optiprep™ density gradient
medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The primary
hepatocytes were suspended in DMEM medium (Lonza,
Verviers, Belgium) and plated on collagen coated dishes.
After four hours the medium was discarded and overlaid
with a sandwich matrix (1.25 μg/cm2 of rat tail collagen).
The medium was replaced with fresh HepatoZYME-SFM
(Life technologies) medium and after 24 hours of culture
primary hepatocytes were treated with 500 µM diclofenac
for a further 24 h. The control group was treated with the
vehicle only (0.5% v/v DMSO).

CONCLUSIONS
The present study provides evidence for a
mechanism of diclofenac induced liver injury that involves
pro-inflammatory cytokine and acute phase responses.
We propose a molecular circuit that lead to an imbalance
of pro- and anti-inflammatory signalling as a cause of
what is supposed to be an idiosyncratic liver injury. The
methodology employed in the present study may also help
to understand immune allergic liver injury induced by
other NSAIDS.

Blood biochemistry
Blood was drawn from the inferior vena cava,
and serum was obtained by centrifugation at 3,000
rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Serum aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (TBIL)
were measured using a Dry Chem-3000 autoanalyzer
(FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan).

METHODS

C57BL6- mice (males, 8 weeks old) were purchased
from the Orient-Bio Co. (Seongnam, Korea). Mice were
maintained under laboratory conditions of controlled
temperature (23 ± 3°C) and humidity (55 ± 10%) with
a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and were given standard food
pellets and water ad libitum. The sodium salt of diclofenac
was purchased from (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and
diluted in sterile saline (Sigma-Aldrich) and administered
daily by intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg (low dose,
N = 6) or 150 mg/kg (high dose, N = 6) for up to 14 days.
Because of the high mortality observed at the 150 mg/kg
dose the genomic studies were performed with tissue
samples of the lower dose only. Control mice (N = 6) were
administered corresponding quantities of saline. The mice
were killed at 24 h (day 1), 72 h (day 3) or 14 days after
vehicle or diclofenac administration. Furthermore, studies
with primary mouse collagen sandwiched hepatocytes
were performed using a protocol previously described
[96, 97] with the following modifications: Briefly, the

RNA extraction
The liver was explanted from the diclofenac
(30 mg/kg) and saline-treated mice, washed free of blood
and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver samples were
subsequently stored in a deep freezer until RNA extraction.
Frozen liver samples were immediately added to the RLT
buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and homogenized
using a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total
RNA from each tissue was isolated and purified using the
RNase mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation. The concentration of total RNA
was assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE), and RNA
integrity was determined with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

Microarray analysis and data capture
Microarray studies were performed with an initial
amount of 250 ng total RNA as previously described
[98]. All steps of cDNA synthesis, biotin labeling,
fragmentation, hybridization, staining, washing and
scanning were performed according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The
15010

Oncotarget

Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse 430 2.0 was used for
microarray analysis and was scanned using a GeneChip
Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). The microarray scanned
image and intensity files (.cel file) were imported into
the GenPlex gene expression analysis software (http://
genplex.co.kr). Data normalization was performed using
MAS 5.0 and Global Median normalization. Differentially
expressed genes were selected using a volcano plot based
on > 1.5-fold change using Welch’s t-test (P < 0.05) and
DEG filtering.
The microarray data were uploaded to the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [accession number
GSE 75277].

thereafter probed with the indicated primary antibodies
(1:200~1:1000) overnight at 4°C. All antibodies were
diluted with SuperBlock T20 (PBS) blocking buffer
(Thermo, Waltham, MA). After washing of the membranes
these were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000) for 2 h. Once
again the membranes were washed to remove excess
secondary antibody and bands were visualized using the
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The anti-STAT3, antiphosphorus STAT3, anti-fibronectin, anti-M-CSF, antiRC-PTP, anti-actin antibodies and secondary antibody
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA). The anti-GHR was purchased from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis
The differentially expressed genes were validated
by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The primers were
purchased from GenoTech (Daejeon, Korea). Total
RNA (2 µg) was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript
II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using an oligo-dT primer
as described by the manufacturer. cDNA samples were
stored at –20°C until use. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
was performed in a 20 µl reaction volume containing
0.5 µl (10pM) forward and reverse specific primers,
10 µl of SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, Califomia), 2 µl of cDNA and 7 µl of nucleasefree water. The cDNA was amplified using a StepOne
and StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The 18S ribosomal RNA primers were used as an
internal control. Note, the primer sequences of all genes
investigated are listed in Table S1.

Western blot analysis
Liver tissue from diclofenac (30 mg/kg) and salinetreated mice (day 1, 3 and 14) was removed, snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and kept in a deep freezer until further
processing. The frozen tissue together with 600 µl of
PRO-PREPTM solution (iNtRON, Seongnam, Korea)
was homogenized with a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany); the homogenate was incubated on ice for
30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4°C for
5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube
and the protein concentration was determined with
the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Subsequently, the samples were heated with BoltTM
sampling buffer (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY)
and reducing agent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) at 70°C
for 10 min. An equal amount of protein lysates was loaded
to Bolt™ bio-tris plus mini gels (Life technologies, Grand
Island, NY) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(Millipore, Bedford, MA). After protein transfer,
membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline
(TBS)/0.1% Tween 20 (ScyTek, West Logan, UT) and 5%
(w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, and

Histopathology
Using standard operating procedures of the
laboratory a range of stains were employed to evaluate the
liver morphology of control and diclofenac treated mice
and included Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E), Periodic
acid-Schiff reaction (PAS), PAS diastase digestion,
Elastica van Gieson, silver and Prussian blue.

Immunohistochemistry
Livers from control and diclofenac treated animals
were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and

embedded in paraffin block using standard protocols of
the laboratory. 1 μm thick sections were deparaffinised and
rehydrated through a descending alcohol series followed
by a 4 min washing step in distilled H2O. Subsequently,
antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer (pH
6) in a water bath at 98oC for 30 min. The ZytoChemPlus HRP Polymer-Kit of Zytomed Systems, Germany
was used for immunohistochemistry. The slides were
rinsed with distilled H2O and after a 5 min incubation
step in tris-buffered saline (washing buffer), endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% peroxidase
blocking reagent (Merck, Germany) for 5 min followed
by a second washing step. Thereafter, the sections
were blocked for 5 min with protein-block serum free
reagent (ZytoChem-Plus HRP Polymer-Kit, reagent 1)
and incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min. The
antibodies were purchased from diverse vendors and
diluted with washing buffer as given in parenthesis: CD
31 (DAKO clone JC 70 A, Germany diluted to 1:75),
CD68 (DAKO clone KP-1, Germany diluted to 1:100),
Lipopolysacharide binding protein sc-14666 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., USA diluted to 1: 25), Tc-PTP sc102192 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA diluted to
1:75), macrophage colony stimulating factor sc-365779
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA diluted to 1:300),
Ki-67 (Thermo Fischer clone SP 6, Germany diluted to
1:100) fibronectin sc-8442 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., USA diluted to 1:50), growth hormone receptor
ab134087 (Abcam, UK diluted to 1:300), Leptin receptor
sc-18931 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA diluted
to 1:50) and Hep Par1 clone OCH1E5 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology sc-58693, Inc., USA diluted to 1:800).
The bound primary antibodies or bridging antibodies
were incubated with labelled polymer HRP Anti-Rabbit
or anti Mouse secondary antibody (ZytoChem-Plus
HRP Polymer-Kit, reagent 2) for 20 min. Subsequently,
the reaction was developed and visualized by use of
reagent 3 of the ZytoChem-Plus HRP Polymer-Kit and by
placing the slides in a moist chamber at room temperature
allowing an incubation time of 30 min.
Finally, the sections were counterstained with
Haematoxylin for 5 min, washed under running warm tap
water for 10 min and dehydrated in a cabinet at 60oC for
20 min, coverslipped and examined under a light
microscope (Nikon Ni-E microscope, Japan). Image capture
and photo- documentation was done with the Nikon NIS
basic research microscopic imaging software version 4.3.
The images were converted into Tiff files and unless
otherwise stated the images were finalised in Adobe
Photoshop version CS5. With the exception of Ki67 and
Hep Par 1 all immunohistochemistry images are shown in
the auto-colour function mode.

Venn diagram analysis, and inflammatory, immune
and stress response genes were sorted by biological
process and gene ontology using the GenPlex software
version 3.0. The functions and canonical pathways of
the differentially expressed genes were subsequently
interrogated using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
software version 9.0; (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood
City, CA). This system is continuously updated with
new scientific publications, review articles, text books
and KEGG ligand information stored in the ingenuity
system knowledge base. P-values < 0.05 were considered
as statistically significant and therefore non-random
association. P-values were calculated using the righttailed Fisher exact test.

Bioinformatic analysis
The microarray expression data were normalized
using the MAS5 algorithm available within the
GeneXplain 3.0 platform (http://www.genexplain.
com/). Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
were determined by applying a hypergeometric test
to the normalised data sets with a cut-off ≥ ± 1.5 fold
change and p-value < 0.01. Genes satisfying these
conditions were grouped as up- and down-regulated and
a heat map for DEGs was created based on the averagelinkage hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance
(ArrayTrack software Version 3.5.0 [99]).

Functional enrichment analysis
DEGs were mapped to various ontologies, i.e.
biological processes, cellular components, molecular
functions, reactome pathways and transcription factor
classification. For each ontological term respective
p-values were calculated using the GeneXplain platform,
Version 3.0.

Gene regulatory network analysis
Regulatory gene networks were constructed with
an analysis tool of the GeneWays database [http://wiki.
biouml.org/index.php/Geneways] available within the
GeneXplain platform Version 3.0. A default cut-off score
of 0.2, a FDR < 0.05 and a Z-score at 1.0 with a maximum
radius of 4 steps upstream of an input gene set was set to
identify statistically significant master regulatory genes.
Note, the GeneWays tool is an integrated system used
to automatically extract, analyse, visualize and integrate
molecular pathway data from published peer reviewed
articles and more than eight million abstracts [100].

Transcription factor binding site analysis

Primary genomic data analysis

The TRANSFAC® 2013.2 library of positional
weight matrices and ‘vertebrate_non_redundant_
minSUM’ profile was used for an identification of

transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in promoters
of up- and down-regulated genes (Yes-set). Specifically,
promoters of DEGs were extracted using an automated
procedure with respect to the transcriptional start site
(TSS) and contained the TFIIB recognition element and
the TATA-box at the 5′-end, an initiator region around the
TSS and a downstream promoter element (DPE) at the
3′-end [101]. The extracted promoters were interrogated
for cis-regulatory binding sites with a length of −1000 to
+100 base pairs relative to the TSS. Overrepresentation
of transcription factor binding sites in promoters of
differentially expressed genes were identified by
comparing individual sites in promoters of DEG (= Yes-set)
and non-regulated genes (= No-set) as previously
described by Stegmaier et al., 2011 [102].

A composite module is a particular combination
of positional weight matrices (PWM) for different
transcription factors and is based on an analysis of
individual TFBS with a test for pairwise co-occurrences
of binding sites. As described recently, the approach
represents a variant of the F-MATCH algorithm for
binding site pairs and quantifies overrepresentation
of promoter sequences with sites of both PWMs in
the foreground set using the Fisher test [102–104].
Specifically, DEGs implicated in the inflammation,
immune and stress response were considered for
composite module (CM) construction, and the procedure
is based on the primary multi-component fitness function
as to ascertain co-occupancy of different transcription
factors in promoters of regulated genes [102, 104]. The
default filtering criteria of the GeneXplain platform was
used and statistically significant composite modules were
determined.
