BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of antibiotic use (including prophylaxis) on
the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) breakthrough bacteremia in cancer patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the authors identified all bacteremia episodes from July 2005 to December 2006 at their tertiary cancer center and compared the bacteria types and antimicrobial resistance in isolates from patients who had received
antimicrobial agents as therapy or prophylaxis (breakthrough infections) with those from patients who had not
received antimicrobial agents (nonbreakthrough bacteremia). RESULTS: Breakthrough bacteremia was more likely to
be associated with MDR Escherichia coli (P ¼ .002), MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P ¼ .02), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (P ¼ .01). Multivariate analysis revealed that breakthrough bacteremia was associated with hematologic malignancies and neutropenia (odds ratios, 9.9 and 3.0, respectively). Fluoroquinolone use was associated
significantly with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (P ¼ .04), MDR E. coli (P < .001), and
MDR P. aeruginosa (P ¼ .05). A strong association was observed between fluoroquinolone use and breakthrough bacteremia in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 22; P < .001). Patients who had received vancomycin were more likely to
have vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream isolates than patients who had not received antibacterial agents
(P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Breakthrough infections were more common in neutropenic patients and in patients who
had hematologic malignancies. The isolation of MDR organisms was associated strongly with the use of fluoroquinolones. The current findings demonstrated the importance of using a comprehensive approach to the prevention of

The use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in cancer patients with neutropenia is common but generates continued controversy because of increasing antimicrobial resistance. In neutropenic patients with solid tumors and lymphoma who were
receiving chemotherapy, daily levofloxacin reduced febrile episodes, probable infections, and rates of hospitalization for
probable infection compared with patients who were receiving placebo.1 However, prophylaxis had no effect on severe
infection or mortality secondary to infection. In that study, there also was a higher rate of adverse events (particularly gastrointestinal and dermatologic events) in patients who received levofloxacin than in patients who received placebo.1
Another study reported that antibacterial prophylaxis with levofloxacin was beneficial in neutropenic cancer patients, leading to lower incidences of bacteremia and microbiologically documented infections and shorter fever durations.2 However, significantly more fluoroquinolone-resistant, Gram-negative organisms were reported in the levofloxacin group.2
The effect of antimicrobial prophylaxis on bacteremia is unclear. A study of patients in a cancer center in eastern
Europe demonstrated high rates of polymicrobial infections (>60%) and antimicrobial resistance (>30%).3 Breakthrough infections were reported more often in patients with acute leukemia who were receiving antimicrobial therapy.
The common use of levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis may put patients at risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)4 and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa5 on the basis of data
from hospitalized patients. MRSA and MDR Gram-negative organisms are inherently challenging to treat, requiring
drugs with high costs and toxicity (eg linezolid, daptomycin, colistin, and aminoglycosides). Higher mortality rates have

been reported in patients with MRSA than in those with
methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, even with appropriate
treatment.6,7 Appropriate and prompt therapy is essential
to achieve optimal outcomes.8
In a tertiary cancer center, the selection of appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy is particularly
important given the impaired immune response associated with hematologic malignancies and chemotherapy.
Therefore, in this study, we investigated the role of antimicrobial exposure in the emergence of MDR breakthrough bacteremia in patients at a tertiary cancer center
at which antimicrobial prophylaxis is widely used.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical and Microbiologic Data
We conducted a retrospective study of bacteremia in
patients with central venous catheters at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (M. D. Anderson),
a 500-bed, comprehensive cancer center in Houston,
Texas. All episodes of bacteremia from July 2005 to December 2006 were identified and analyzed from the M.
D. Anderson Infection Control database with further information obtained by chart review. Blood cultures were
been obtained using the BACTEC 9240 automated culturing system (Plus Aerobic/F bottles; BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Md) and the Isolator 10 system (Wampole
Laboratories, Cranbury, NJ). When an Isolator tube culture was positive, the number of colony-forming units
was quantified from 10 mL of blood cultured on plates.
Patients’ demographic characteristics (including age
and sex), risk factors (including neutropenia and stem cell
transplantation), cancer type (including solid tumors and
hematologic malignancies), admitting service, local signs
and symptoms of infection (in the setting of catheterrelated bloodstream infections), and antimicrobial use
were obtained from electronic medical records. The study
was approved by the M. D. Anderson institutional review
board.
Definitions
Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count
of 0.5  103 cells/mL. Breakthrough bacteremia was
defined as bacteremia in patients who had undergone
antimicrobial prophylaxis for a minimum of 48 hours
before diagnosis. MDR Escherichia coli9 (resistant to 3
antimicrobial classes of agents, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones) and MDR P. aeruginosa9 (resistant to 3

968

antimicrobial classes of agents, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones), vancomycin-resistant enterococci10 (VRE), and
MRSA10 were defined according to breakpoints as
described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Catheter-related bloodstream infections
were defined as probable or definite according to standard
criteria used by the Infectious Diseases Society of
America.11
Statistical Methods
Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. Categorical variables were analyzed using
chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive
effect of each factor alone. Any factor that exhibited a P
value <.25 was included in a full multiple logistic regression model. Finally, the full model was reduced by a backward selection procedure at a significance level of 5% (P
< .05). All analyses were performed using SAS software
version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
We identified 622 episodes of bacteremia, including 345
breakthrough bacteremia episodes and 277 nonbreakthrough bacteremia episodes. The breakthrough and nonbreakthrough bacteremia groups did not differ
significantly with regard to sex, age, the presence of graftversus-host disease, or the type(s) of organism(s) isolated
(Table 1). Approximately 10% of bacteremias were polymicrobial in nature and had multiple bacteria (including
acid-fast bacilli) or fungi isolated; we observed no significant difference between the 2 groups.
Patients with neutropenia (P < .001), patients who
had undergone bone marrow transplantation (autologous,
P ¼ .001; allogeneic, P ¼ .02), and patients with hematologic malignancies (P < .001) were more likely to experience breakthrough bacteremia (Table 1), as expected. It is
noteworthy that graft-versus-host disease and unrelated
bone marrow transplantation status did not differ significantly between the groups, but both characteristics were
rare (3%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis
confirmed the increased risk of breakthrough bacteremia
in patients with hematologic malignancies (odds ratio
[OR], 9.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1-15.8) and
neutropenia (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.0-4.6) (Table 2).
Breakthrough bacteremia was associated with the
isolation of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, including

Exposure to cephalosporins alone significantly
increased the risk of isolating VRE (P ¼ .02) but not other
MDR organisms (data not shown). It is noteworthy that
the use of multiple antibiotics (combination regimens
only), compared with no antimicrobial agents, resulted in
a greater likelihood of isolating VRE (P ¼ .002) (Table 6)
and MDR P. aeruginosa (P ¼ .005), with a trend toward
the greater likelihood of isolating MDR E. coli (P ¼ .07)
(Table 6).

DISCUSSION
The results of our study demonstrate that antimicrobial
resistance, as measured by the frequency of VRE, MDR
E. coli, and MDR Pseudomonas bacteremia, was associated
with antibacterial therapy and prophylaxis in cancer
patients. In a subset analysis, the risk of MRSA in particular was greater with fluoroquinolone exposure. Fluoroquinolones also were associated with an increased risk of
MDR Gram-negative bacteremia (Tables 4, 5). Exposure
to any combination antimicrobial agents, as either therapy
or prophylaxis, resulted in an increased risk of isolating
MDR P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and VRE (Table 6). Therefore, understanding previous exposure to antimicrobial
agents is critical for predicting MDR breakthrough
bacteremia.

Infections are a leading cause of mortality in patients
with malignancies. The use of prophylaxis agents is
becoming more common, particularly during periods of
significant risk, such as chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or expected periods of prolonged neutropenia. A significant concern, given the limited development of new
antimicrobial agents, is the emergence of resistance to currently available antimicrobial agents. The results of the
current study further characterize the relation between
antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk patient population and antimicrobial resistance in bacteremia.
Several studies have described the benefits of antimicrobial prophylaxis in the setting of neutropenia. The
strongest advocates cite a meta-analysis in which it was
reported that prophylaxis resulted in a mortality benefit12;
however, the authors of that report admitted that 20% of
the studies that they included in their meta-analysis did
not include all-cause mortality and that the studies with
the largest effect had ‘‘unclear methodologic quality.’’12
Therefore, the effect of levofloxacin prophylaxis, as 1 of
the most commonly used prophylactic agents, on
mortality is controversial. Gafter-Gvili et al13 specifically
evaluated the effect of quinolone prophylaxis on resistance. Those authors noted that patients who had microbiologically documented MRSA demonstrated increased
resistance to fluoroquinolones compared with patients

who received placebo or no intervention (relative risk,
1.92; 95% CI, 1.40-2.63).
Appropriate empiric regimens for acutely ill cancer
patients are particularly important, because these patients
commonly have limited immunologic defenses either
caused by primary disease processes or secondary to chemotherapy, transplantation medications, radiation-associated burns, or postsurgical infection. Various studies have
clearly demonstrated that inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy for MRSA,8 MDR Gram-negative organisms,14 and VRE15 has a significant negative effect on
mortality.
Empiric therapy also needs to take into account the
use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital and community. The use of fluoroquinolones, particularly levofloxacin, in hospitals and surrounding areas was associated
with the increased isolation of MDR P. aeruginosa in a
nationwide (United States) study of teaching hospitals.5
In addition, prolonged carbapenem exposure has been
associated with the emergence of MDR P. aeruginosa in a
study of cancer patients at this center.16 In our study,
MDR P. aeruginosa was associated with the use of multiple antibiotics, including carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (Tables 5, 6).
MDR E. coli has been isolated in catheter-related
bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and (recently) pyomyositis.17 Previous quinolone use has been associated
with ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections.18 The results of other studies conflict,
however, suggesting that age, nursing home residence,
and aminoglycoside use are risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance.18 It is of interest and concern that, in 1
study, MDR Gram-negative bacilli reportedly were present on admission to hospital.19 In another study that
focused on stem cell transplantation units, the use of
third-generation cephalosporins and hospitalization at
certain high-risk hospitals was associated with MDR
Gram-negative bacteremia.20 In the current study, MDR
E. coli bacteremia was associated with the use of a fluoroquinolone-containing regimen (Table 5) and quinolones
alone (Table 4), both compared with no antimicrobial
treatment.
Previous studies have demonstrated that VRE colonization is associated with an increased risk of VRE
bacteremia.21 Isolation of VRE is increased with carbapenems,22 vancomycin, and cephalosporin use21,23; and
VRE bacteremia is more likely to develop in patients from
long-term care facilities who have infections at another

body site.21 Mortality also has been associated independently with VRE bacteremia and immunosuppressed status.21 In our study, VRE bacteremia was associated with
breakthrough infection and exposure to multiple antimicrobial agents, including vancomycin (P ¼ .002) and
cephalosporins (P ¼ .02).
In our study, MRSA bacteremia was significantly
more common in patients who were receiving a fluoroquinolone-containing regimen (P ¼ .04) (Table 5). The association between MRSA and fluoroquinolone exposure has
been described well in the medical literature4,24,25; however, to our knowledge, this effect has not been observed
with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in the oncology population,2 possibly because of insufficient power in previous
studies.26 The emergence of MRSA relies on antimicrobial exposure in various settings and is complicated further by the replacement of healthcare-associated strains
with community-associated strains, at least with respect to
bloodstream infections.27 Community-associated MRSA
is associated with necrotizing pneumonia and soft tissue
infection, but it is not associated with bacteremia.28 In a
hospital in Taiwan, mortality rates for MRSA bacteremia
were dramatically higher than those for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus bacteremia (49.8% vs 28.6%; P < .001).29
Previous studies have implicated macrolides,30,31 fluoroquinolones,30-32 and third-generation cephalosporin
use31 in the emergence of MRSA. Our study demonstrated that a quinolone-containing regimen was
associated with an increased risk of MRSA bacteremia
(Table 5).
Various limitations are noted in this study. First, it
was a retrospective study, which introduces the risk of
selection bias. This risk is somewhat tempered by the
inclusion of all available patients who had bacteremia
diagnosed over approximately 1.5 years at a large, tertiary
care cancer center and identified by microbiology records.
Another limitation is that medications like steroids, tacrolimus, and chemotherapy, which can increase the risk of
bacteremia, were not included in the data collection and
analysis.
The findings from our multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that hematologic malignancy
(OR, 9.9; 95% CI, 6.1-15.8) and neutropenia (OR, 3.0;
95% CI, 2.0-4.6) are risk factors for breakthrough bacteremia. Breakthrough bacteremia also was associated with
VRE, MDR E. coli, and MDR P. aeruginosa. In addition,
MRSA, MDR P. aeruginosa, and MDR E. coli were isolated more commonly in patients who were receiving
fluoroquinolones.

Novel approaches to minimizing the morbidity and
mortality associated with the development of MDR bacteremia should be both comprehensive and creative. At
our institution, antimicrobial-impregnated catheters have
been indispensable for significantly reducing the rate of
bacteremia caused by resistant organisms in cancer
patients without the development of antimicrobial resistance.33-35 Because the central venous catheter is a major
source of bacteremia caused by resistant bacteria, antimicrobial-coated catheters represent a novel, successful
approach to the prevention of such infections without the
use of systemic antibiotics and the subsequent risks of antibiotic resistance.33-35 In addition, antimicrobial stewardship programs that incorporate a variety of measures,
such as antibiotic restriction, feedback, and education,
improve the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents and
may prevent the emergence of drug-resistant organisms.36
An important component of antimicrobial stewardship
programs is infrastructure, including a well funded, hospital administration-supported infection control program
with sophisticated data management tools that can provide timely information for targeting interventions.36
Our findings re-emphasize the need for taking into
account previous prophylactic and therapeutic regimens
when considering the empiric treatment of bacteremia in
patients who have been exposed to antibacterial agents as
prophylaxis or treatment. The balance between attempts
to minimize the development of resistance and the appropriate use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent infectious complications will require a commitment by
institutions and health systems to monitor these relations
and their impact on important outcomes.
