ABSTRACT
An infusion-dialysis based procedure has been developed as an approach to
isolate organic nanoparticles from green tea. Tea nanoparticle (TNP) can effectively
load doxorubicin (DOX) via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. We established
an ABCB1 overexpressing tumor xenograft mouse model to investigate whether
TNP can effectively deliver DOX into tumors and bypass the efflux function of the
ABCB1 transporter, thereby increasing the intratumoral accumulation of DOX and
potentiating the anticancer activity of DOX. MTT assays suggested that DOX-TNP
showed higher cytotoxicity toward CCD-18Co, SW620 and SW620/Ad300 cells than
DOX. Animal study revealed that DOX-TNP resulted in greater inhibitory effects on
the growth of SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumors than DOX. In pharmacokinetics
study, DOX-TNP greatly increased the SW620 and SW620/Ad300 intratumoral
concentrations of DOX. But DOX-TNP had no effect on the plasma concentrations
of DOX. Furthermore, TNP is a safe nanocarrier with excellent biocompatibility and
minimal toxicity. Ex vivo IHC analysis of SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumor sections
revealed evidence of prominent antitumor activity of DOX-TNP. In conclusion,
our findings suggested that natural nanomaterials could be useful in combating
multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells and potentiating the anticancer activity
of chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

cell proliferation and targeting the fast-dividing cancer
cells [3]. However, long-term cancer chemotherapy often
results in the development of resistance to anticancer
drugs and attenuates the efficacy of cancer treatment,
leading to higher chances of “cancer relapse” [4].
Multidrug resistance (MDR) appears to be the
leading blockade in chemotherapy. It is a phenomenon
in which cancer cells become resistant to drugs with
different chemical structures and mechanisms of
action [5]. Interestingly, the mechanisms of MDR are
very complicated and comprised of alterations in the
permeability of lipid bilayer membranes, suppression
of apoptosis, upregulated DNA repair of cancer cells,
inactivation or detoxification of drugs, changes in the
number of membrane receptors or transporters involved
in accumulating or effluxing drugs from cells [6]. The

Cancer is well defined as a disease in which
abnormal cells divide without control and invade nearby
tissues, and is often clinically referred to as tumor or
malignant neoplasm. Cancer has been ranked as the second
most primary cause of death after cardiovascular diseases
in the world [1]. Cancer is comprised of approximately
two hundred potent, heterogeneous diseases that originate
in specific organs such as the lung, breast, colorectum and
prostate, rather than a single disease [2]. Cancer therapy
usually includes surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy
and combination therapy. As a first-line treatment
for various cancers, chemotherapy uses drugs with
different chemical structures and mechanisms of action.

overexpression of a family of specific transmembrane,
energy-dependent transporters known as ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters is one of the primary
mechanisms that cause MDR in cancer cells [7].
ABCB1 or P-gp (Phospho-glycoprotein) is the first ATPdependent system to be discovered [8, 9]. As an apical
plasma membrane transporter, ABCB1 is ubiquitously
expressed in kidneys, intestines, placenta, liver, adrenal
glands and blood-brain barrier (BBB) cells, where it
normally functions to extrude certain xenobiotics and
protect cells from toxicants [10, 11]. It has been reported
that overexpression of ABCB1 plays an important role
in eliciting MDR in cancer chemotherapy and displays
high resistance to a wide variety of substrate anticancer
drugs, such as anthracyclines [doxorubicin (DOX),
daunorubicin], vinca alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine),
taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), epipodophyllotoxins
(etoposide, teniposide), imatinib mesylate (STI571; gleevec) [12, 13], antibiotics (dactinomycin and
actinomycin D) [14], some HMG coenzyme A (statins),
antihistaminics, antiarrhythmics, steroid hormones,
calcium channel blockers and HIV protease inhibitors [11].
Furthermore, ABCB1 has been found to be overexpressed
in different cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GIST), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), fallopian
tube, ovarian and thyroid cancer [15–19].
In recent years, much attention has been paid to the
development of natural nanomaterials, such as viruses
[20], lipoproteins [21], diatoms nano-biosilica [22], ivy
nanoparticles [23, 24], and fungal nanoparticles [25].
This is because natural nanomaterials have excellent
biocompatibility and less toxicity as compared to chemically
synthesized nanomaterials. Natural nanomaterials also have
characteristics desired for medicinal applications [26–28].
In traditional Chinese medicine, tea is a healthy beverage.
Tea is loaded with antioxidants and nutrients that have
powerful effects on the human body. It is reported that tea
can improve brain function, promote fat loss, lower the risk
of cardiovascular disease, cancer and type II diabetes, as
well as with many other incredible health benefits [29, 30].
It has also been reported that tea is associated with many
therapeutic effects, including anti-hypertension [31], antiblood coagulation [32], HIV treatment [33], oxidative
damage repair [34, 35] and cancer prevention and treatment
[36, 37]. Chinese people have been drinking tea for
thousands of years. It is well known that certain tea derived
compounds have antineoplastic capability. However, little is
known about the effects of tea derived compounds on MDR.
In a previous study, we developed an infusiondialysis based procedure for isolating organic nanoparticles
from green tea. It has been revealed that isolated tea
nanoparticle (TNP) is spherical with diameters of
100–300 nm and have a zeta potential of −26.52 mV at
pH 7.0. Chemical analysis indicated that (−) Epigallocatechin
gallate, caffeine, and theobromine were not found in TNP
[38]. Moreover, the TNP had an immunostimulatory
effect by increasing the secretion of numerous cytokines
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(IL-6, TNF-α, and G-CSF) as well as chemokines
(RANTES, IP-10, MDC) from mouse macrophages
RAW264.7. Importantly, TNP is capable of loading
DOX effectively through electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions (Figure 1A). DOX-loaded Tea nanoparticle
(DOX-TNP) promoted the intracellular uptake of DOX and
showed higher cytotoxicity in A549 human lung cancer and
MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, DOX-TNP greatly
enhanced DOX uptake and cytotoxicity in MCF-7/ADR
multidrug resistant breast cancer cells [38]. These findings
have triggered our curiosity to explore if these in vitro
results could be translated into the in vivo animal model. In
the present study, we investigated the potential of TNP as a
multifunctional nanocarrier for chemotherapy in an ABCB1
overexpressing tumor xenograft mouse model.

RESULTS
Cytotoxic effect of DOX-TNP
In order to investigate the cytotoxicity of DOX, DOXTNP and TNP on different human normal and cancer cell
lines, MTT assays were performed using a human normal
colon fibroblast cell line CCD-18Co, a human colon cancer
cell line SW620, and its doxorubicin-selected ABCB1
overexpressing subline SW620/Ad300. As shown in Table 1,
the IC50 values of DOX in these three cell lines were 0.190 μM,
0.077 μM, and 4.430 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the
IC50 values of DOX-TNP in these three cell lines were
0.043 μM, 0.009 μM, and 0.852 μM, respectively.
Importantly, we found that DOX-TNP showed significantly
higher cytotoxicity than DOX in all three cell lines
(Figure 1B, 1C and 1D). SW620 cells were 4.8-time more
susceptible to DOX-TNP than CCD-18Co, suggesting that
DOX-TNP had good anticancer selectivity with higher
cytotoxicity to colon cancer cells than normal colon fibroblast
cells. Furthermore, the IC50 values of TNP were greater than
300 M for all three cell lines, indicating that the TNP had such
low cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility (Table 1).

ABCB1 expression and localization in SW620
and SW620/Ad300 cells
To determine if ABCB1 is expressed in SW620
and SW620/Ad300 cells, Western blot analysis was
performed. The result indicated a band with a molecular
weight of approximately 170-kDa in the SW620/Ad300
cell lysates, suggesting the presence of ABCB1 protein.
In contrast, this band was not present in parental SW620,
indicating the absence of ABCB1 protein (Figure 1E). The
immunofluorescence assays were performed to examine
the localization of ABCB1 in SW620 and SW620/Ad300
cells. As shown in Figure 1F, the ABCB1 protein was
highly expressed in the cell membranes of SW620/Ad300
cells and but not in the SW620 cells, which was consistent
with the Western blot analysis. This result suggested that
ABCB1 was induced in MDR cancer cells.

21.6 g, 20.9 g, 20.5 g and 21.8 g, respectively. The body
weights of mice after 18-day treatment were 21.0 g,
21.0 g, 19.3 g and 20.7 g. No apparent weight loss was
observed among the four treatment groups (Figure 4A).
Hence administration of DOX, TNP and DOX-TNP did
not produce any visible toxicity or phenotypic changes
in mice. Since myelosuppression (neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia) are the common adverse effects of
DOX, we conducted blood smear tests to investigate the
number of white blood cells (WBC) and platelets in mice.
It has been reported that the normal range of WBC in
mice are 2.32 × 109 ~ 8.38 × 109 WBC/L [39]. The mean
numbers of WBC in mice treated with vehicle, TNP, DOX
and DOX-TNP, were 4.17 × 109, 4.04 × 109, 2.53 x 109
and 2.68 × 109 cells/L, respectively (Figure 4B). The
normal range of platelets in mice is 0.7 x 1011 ~ 12.0 × 1011
platelets/L [39]. Figure 4C indicated that the mean numbers
of platelets in mice treated with vehicle, TNP, DOX and
DOX-TNP, were 4.13 × 1011, 4.29 × 1011, 3.36 × 1011
and 5.29 × 1011 cells/L. The mean numbers of WBC and
platelets in the four treatment groups were all within the
normal range, suggesting that TNP and DOX-TNP did not
cause neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in mice.
It is well known that the most dangerous side effect
of DOX is cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart
failure [40]. Cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) is often used as a
marker to indicate the damage of cardiac muscle [41]. As
shown in Figure 5B, the average levels of cTnI in mice
treated with vehicle, TNP, DOX and DOX-TNP, were
201.85 pg/ml, 199.71 pg/ml, 358.28 pg/ml and 351.85 pg/ml,
respectively. Importantly, the cTnI levels of the TNP group
were similar to those of the vehicle group, indicating that
TNP had no cardiotoxicity. The cTnI levels of DOX-TNP
group were slightly lower than those of DOX group, which
had moderate cardiotoxicity. In addition, compared with
DOX, the slight reduction of cTnI in DOX-TNP group was
not statistically significant, indicating that TNP alone has
no cardiotoxicity effect in mice. In conclusion, TNP is safe
nanocarrier with excellent biocompatibility and minimal
toxicity.

To investigate the efficacy of DOX, TNP and DOXTNP in cancer treatment, tumor xenograft mouse models
were used. Mice with SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumors
were administered with 2.00 mg/kg DOX, 0.71 mg/kg
TNP and DOX-TNP. The change of SW620 tumor size
after treatment was shown in Figure 2A and 2B showed
that the tumor volumes of SW620 tumors after the
18-day treatment of vehicle, TNP, DOX and DOX-TNP
were 2685.8 mm3, 2687.9 mm3, 768.4 mm3 and 526.5 mm3,
respectively. The tumor weights of SW620 tumors after
the 18-day treatment of vehicle, TNP, DOX and DOXTNP were 3.57 g, 3.54 g, 0.94 g and 0.61 g, respectively
(Figure 2C). Interestingly, it was found that DOX-TNP had
more potent inhibitory effect than DOX on the growth of
SW620 tumors over an 18-day treatment period.
The change of SW620/Ad300 tumor size after
treatment was shown in Figure 3A and 3B showed that
the tumor volumes of SW620/Ad300 tumors after the
18-day treatment of vehicle, TNP, DOX and DOX-TNP
were 1826.2 mm3, 1885.9 mm3, 1062.1 mm3 and 438.4
mm3, respectively. The tumor weights of SW620/Ad300
tumors after the 18-day treatment of vehicle, TNP, DOX
and DOX-TNP were 2.38 g, 2.33 g, 1.33 g and 0.51 g,
respectively (Figure 3C). These results implied that TNP
significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of DOX
on the growth of SW620/Ad300 tumors over an 18-day
treatment period. These findings suggest that DOX-TNP
has a greater inhibitory effect on the growth of SW620 and
SW/Ad300 tumors than DOX alone, which is consistent
with the previous in vitro results.

TNP significantly enhanced DOX concentrations
in tumors but not in plasma of the ABCB1
overexpressing tumor xenograft model

both SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumors is partially due
to its better drug delivery of DOX into tumors, thereby
increasing the intratumoral accumulation of DOX.

In a separate study, we measured the plasma
and intratumoral concentrations of DOX in animals
pretreated with vehicle, TNP, DOX and DOX-TNP. The
pharmacokinetic data showed that DOX-TNP significantly
increased the SW620 intratumoral concentration of DOX
(525.5 ± 70.7 ng/ml) as compared to DOX alone (403.6 ±
48.8 ng/ml, p < 0.05) up to 240 min after administration
(Figure 5D). Furthermore, DOX-TNP also significantly
enhanced the SW620/Ad300 intratumoral concentration
of DOX (329.9 ± 35.4 ng/ml) as compared to DOX
alone (162.9 ± 23.9 ng/ml, p < 0.01) up to 240 min after
administration (Figure 5D). However, DOX-TNP did not
significantly affect plasma levels of DOX (Figure 5C)
after 240 min following administration. These data implies
that TNP-induced increment in the efficacy of DOX in

Ex vivo immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of
SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumor sections
IHC analysis (H & E, ABCB1, Caspase-3, PARP
and CD4 staining) was performed to further evaluate
the in vivo antitumor activity. As shown in Figure 6, the
DOX-TNP and DOX groups displayed obvious nuclear
condensation and fragmentation in the H & E images.
In comparison, the cells in the vehicle and TNP groups
retained normal morphologies. Consistent with Western
blot analysis and IF assays, ABCB1 is overexpressed in
SW620/Ad300 tumors in vehicle group, as compared to
SW620 tumors. Interestingly, it was found that DOX-TNP
and DOX can significantly upregulate the expression levels
of ABCB1. As is well known, Caspase-3 and PARP are

commonly used as biomarkers for cell apoptosis and CD4
is commonly used as a biomarker for cell necrosis [42–44].
As anticipated, the Caspase-3 and PARP expression
levels were significantly increased in the DOX-TNP
group, indicating that DOX-TNP caused the highest level
of cell apoptosis in SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumors,
as compared to other three groups. Interestingly, CD4
staining suggested that the DOX-TNP group possessed
the highest level of cell necrosis in SW620 and SW620/
Ad300 tumors (Figure 6). Therefore, the IHC analyses are
supportive of the potent anticancer activity of DOX-TNP.

latest molecular targeted drugs such as small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.
Antineoplastic drugs discovery endeavors are currently
aimed at reducing the threshold for apoptosis in cancer
cells, resensitizing cancer cells to drugs, meanwhile
making their toxicities more manageable [45]. In this
study, we established an ABCB1 overexpressing tumor
xenograft mouse model to demonstrate that TNP is able to
effectively deliver DOX into tumors and bypass the efflux
function of ABCB1 transporter, thereby significantly
increasing the intratumoral accumulation of DOX and
potentiating the anticancer activity of DOX. First, MTT
results suggested that DOX-TNP were more cytotoxic
to CCD-18Co, SW620, and SW620/Ad300 cells than
DOX. SW620 cells were more vulnerable to DOX-TNP
than CCD-18Co, implying that DOX-TNP not only had
improved anticancer efficacy, but also good anticancer

selectivity. While the IC50 values of TNP were bigger
than 300 μM for all three cell lines, suggesting that TNP
is a safe, biocompatible nanocarrier (Table 1). Using
the tumor xenograft mouse model, we discovered that
TNP significantly strengthened the inhibitory effects of
DOX on the growth of both SW620 and SW620/Ad300
tumors over an 18-day treatment period (Figures 2 and
3). Figure 2C showed that the tumor weights of SW620
tumors after the 18-day treatment of vehicle, TNP, DOX
and DOX-TNP were 3.57 g, 3.54 g, 0.94 g, and 0.61 g.
The tumor weights of SW620/Ad300 tumors after the
18-day treatment of vehicle, TNP, DOX and DOX-TNP
were 2.38 g, 2.33 g, 1.33 g and 0.51 g, respectively
(Figure 3C). By comparing the potency of anti-tumor
effects between SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumors, it
was found that DOX and DOX-TNP can shrink SW620
tumors by 3.8 times and 5.9 times as compared to vehicle
control group. Furthermore, DOX and DOX-TNP can
inhibit the growth of SW620/Ad300 tumors by 1.8 times
and 4.7 times. The only 1.8 times inhibition of DOX
on the SW620/Ad300 tumors is much smaller than the

3.8 times shrinkage of SW620 tumors by DOX, revealing
that the ABCB1-overexpressing SW620/Ad300 tumors
are resistant to DOX treatment. Interestingly, the 4.7 times
inhibition of DOX-TNP is obviously stronger than the
1.8 times inhibition of DOX on the SW620/Ad300 tumors.
These findings indicate that DOX-TNP might have a better
application in MDR tumors.
In vitro experiments are nonphysiological and have
important limitations. DMEM culture medium is the solely
environment for in vitro cancer cells. However, living
creatures are biologically complex and this is especially
true in higher order animals, including humans. Tumor
environment in vivo is dependent on a more sophisticated
system including circulatory system (extracellular and
intracellular fluid), immune system, endocrine system,
digestive system, etc. While the data from experiments
carried out in cancer cells is important, in vivo studies,
using animals, are necessary to investigate how drugs can
produce therapeutic effects in a whole living organism.
Many in vivo interactions are complex and cannot be
obtained from in vitro experiments. Thus, using in vitro

data as guidance and them performing in vivo experiments
will be the best way to determine if DOX-TNP can be
clinically useful in humans. Macrophages and other
myeloid cells are ubiquitously distributed in solid tumor
microenvironment and modulate tumor cytotoxicity by
releasing various cytokines and other immune factors [46].
It has been reported that the levels of numerous cytokines
(IL-6, TNF-α and G-CSF) as well as chemokines
(RANTES, IP-10, MDC) were significantly increased after
incubation of RAW 264.7 macrophages with the TNP for
24 h [38]. These findings suggest that DOX-TNP may
produce stronger antitumor activity through their ability
to modulate macrophage immune function, which can only
be seen in the in vivo models.
Cardiomyopathy is the most dangerous side effect
of DOX, leading to congestive heart failure [40]. The
troponins include three proteins (troponin I, T and C)

that regulate actin and myosin interactions during muscle
contraction. Troponins T and I have distinct isoforms
that exist in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The release of
these proteins into the bloodstream from cardiomyocyte
necrosis accounts for their application as biomarkers
of cardiac muscle damage. It is reported that the
increment of cTnI levels are associated with more severe
cardiomyopathy [41]. Compared with DOX, the slight
reduction of cTnI in DOX-TNP group was not statistically
significant, indicating that TNP alone may not have
cardiotoxicity effect in mice. Also cTnI levels in mice
indicated that TNP had no cardiotoxicity and DOX-TNP
had moderate cardiotoxicity. Myelosuppression is a major
dose-limiting complication of DOX. Our results showed
that the mean numbers of WBC and platelets in the four
treatment groups were all in the normal range, suggesting
that TNP and DOX-TNP did not cause neutropenia or

TNP is safe nanocarrier with excellent biocompatibility
and minimal toxicity. As shown in the Figure 5D, the
intratumoral concentration of DOX in DOX-TNP group
was significantly higher than that in DOX group in both
SW620 tumors (P < 0.05) and SW620/Ad300 tumors
(P < 0.01), suggesting that TNP stimulated the delivery
of DOX into tumors in the tumor microenvironment. In
contrast, DOX-TNP did not have a significant effect on
plasma concentrations of DOX (Figure 5C) 240 min after
administration. Hence TNP-induced increment in the
efficacy of DOX in SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumors
is partially due to its better drug delivery of DOX into
tumors, thereby increasing the intratumoral accumulation
of DOX.
Ex vivo IHC analysis of SW620 and SW620/Ad300
tumor sections is evidence of the prominent antitumor
activity of DOX-TNP. Cells at the late stage of the
apoptosis displayed morphological standards (chromatin
condensation, DNA fragmentation and membrane blebbing)
that could be readily identified by H & E staining [42]. In
the H & E images, DOX-TNP and DOX group displayed
obvious nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Figure
6). Interestingly, it was found that DOX-TNP and DOX can
significantly upregulate the expression levels of ABCB1.
Caspase-3 is a critical modulator of programmed cell death

(apoptosis). PARP, a major substrate of caspases-3 and -7, is
a useful marker of apoptosis [43]. The Caspase-3 and PARP
staining indicated that the DOX-TNP group possessed the
highest level of cell apoptosis in SW620 and SW620/Ad300
tumors, as compared to other three groups. Moreover, the
CD4 staining displayed that the DOX-TNP group possessed
the highest level of cell necrosis in SW620 and SW620/
Ad300 tumors, as compared to other three groups (Figure 6).
DOX belongs to the group of anthracycline
antibiotics and functions as a topoisomerase II inhibitor.
When targeting topoisomerase II, DOX acts by
stabilizing a reaction intermediate in which DNA strands
are first cleaved and then covalently linked to certain
tyrosine residues of the enzyme, eventually impeding
DNA resealing. Hence the formation of DOX-DNAtopoisomerase II ternary complexes lead to the generation
of irreversible double strand breaks and finally to the
induction of cell death [47]. It has been reported that
DOX induced dose-dependent G2/M and /or G1/S cell
cycle arrest, followed by grade- and dose-dependent
reduction in the amount of the cytosolic trimeric form
of FasL, activation of Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9,
cleavage of PARP, Lamin A/C, Bcl-XL/S and interestingly
Hsp90, and finally cell death [48]. Table 1 showed the IC50
values of TNP were greater than 300 μM for all three cell
lines, indicating that the TNP was nontoxic to cancer cells.

sections (B). In H & E staining, nuclei are stained blue, and extracellular matrix and cytoplasm are stained red. In ABCB1, Caspase-3,
PARP and CD4 staining, nuclei are stained blue, and ABCB1, Caspase-3, PARP and CD4 are stained brown.

Furthermore, our data demonstrated that TNP alone has no
antitumor activity on SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumors
(Figures 2 and 3). Our data also indicated that TNP did
not cause hematopoietic damage or cardiac toxicity
(Figures 4 and 5B). Therefore, TNP potentiates the
anticancer activity of DOX via facilitating the delivery
of DOX into tumors and bypass the efflux function of
ABCB1 transporter. DOX-TNP possessed the similar
mechanism of DOX with increased potency.
In oncology, unique structural features of many solid
tumors, including hypervasculature, defective vascular
architecture, and impaired lymphatic drainage result in the
well-characterized enhanced permeability and retention
(EPR) effect, which is fundamental for nanotechnology
platforms to deliver and accumulate drugs into tumors.
Enhanced permeability of the tumor leaky vasculature
allows macromolecules (DOX-TNP) to enter the tumor
interstitial space and suppressed lymphatic filtration
allows them to stay and accumulate there [49]. Moreover,
the tumor microenvironment is different from plasma
environment. For example, vasculature distribution,
tumor blood flow (blood pressure) and composition of
intratumoral fluid are different and can induce TNP to
release more DOX from DOX-TNP into tumor tissues.
These factors result in accumulation of nanoparticles in the
tumor tissues. That’s why TNP significantly enhanced DOX
concentration in tumors but not in the plasma of mice.
Pegylated liposomal DOX is a very good example
of DOX formulation with reduced cardiotoxicity and an
improved pharmacokinetic profile. Chemotherapy with the
anthracycline doxorubicin is a well established treatment
approach in a number of malignancies; however, DOX is
associated with adverse events that limit its usefulness,
including the development of cumulative dose-related
cardiotoxicity. The emergence of STEALTH® technology
has allowed the development of an enhanced DOX
formulation; DOX has been encapsulated in liposomes
with surface-bound methoxypolyethylene glycol (Doxil®)
in a process known as pegylation, with the aim of retaining
or improving the efficacy of the drug, while minimizing
adverse events. Pegylation protects liposomes from
detection by the mononuclear phagocyte system, thereby
increasing the blood circulation time. Pegylated liposomal
DOX is effective and tolerable in various malignancies,
such as metastatic breast cancer, progressive ovarian
cancer, relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and
AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma [50].
TNP potentiates the anticancer activity of DOX
via facilitating the delivery of DOX into tumors and
bypassing the efflux function of ABCB1 transporter.
Furthermore, DOX-TNP may produce stronger antitumor
activity through their ability to modulate macrophage
immune function, such as by increasing the secretion of
numerous cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and G-CSF) as well as
chemokines (RANTES, IP-10, MDC) from macrophages.
Consequently, the design of this infusion-dialysis based

procedure for isolating organic nanoparticles from green
tea and establishment of the drug-resistant tumor xenograft
mouse model open up a new era in the development
of natural nanomaterials for overcoming MDR in
cancer cells and strengthening the anticancer activity of
chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment.

Preparation of TNP

(PVDF) membranes through electrophoresis. The PVDF
membranes were immersed in blocking solution (5% skim
milk) in TBST buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) to block nonspecific binding
for 1 h at room temperature. Then the PVDF membranes
were immunoblotted overnight with primary monoclonal
antibodies against either β-Actin at 1:200 dilution or
ABCB1 at 1:200 dilution at 4ºC, and were then further
incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rabbit antimouse horseradish peroxide (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibody (1:2000 dilution). The protein–antibody complex
was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system (Amersham, NJ). β-Actin was used to
confirm equal loading in each lane in the samples prepared
from cell lysates.

Green tea infusions were made by steeping 15 g
of dried green tea leaves in 200 ml of boiling deionized
water (DI water) for 20 min. The resulting hot tea infusion
was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, and the
supernatant was filtered through a 1 μm filter (Whatman
Inc., Florham Park, NJ). The filtered solution was then
sonicated in a water-bath sonicater (model 750D, VWR)
at room temperature for 30 min. The free small molecules,
such as alkaloids, and polyphenols, were removed by
dialysis using 300KD MWCO tubing against DI water
for 3 days at room temperature. Size-exclusion highperformance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC) was
used to further isolate the nanoparticles after dialysis.
250 μl of the dialyzed solution was loaded onto a SECHPLC column (Phenomenex®BIOSEP-SEC-S4000), and
eluted with distilled water at 1.0 ml/min of flow rate. The
UV absorption at 280 nm was measured, and all fractions
were collected.

Immunofluorescence (IF) assay
Cells (1 × 104) were seeded in 96-well plate and
harvested overnight. The cells were washed with PBS
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room
temperature and then rinsed with PBS three times. Then
cells were kept in 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4ºC
and rinsed with PBS three times. Non-specific reactions
were blocked with BSA (2 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37ºC. The
monoclonal antibody against ABCB1 (P7965) (1:200)
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was applied
overnight, followed by an Alexa flour 488-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)
for 1 h. PI (Propidium iodide) was used to counterstain the
nuclei. Images were taken with Nikon TE2000 inverted
microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc. Melville, NY).

Preparation of DOX-TNP
The DOX-loaded TNP was prepared by mixing
DOX (0.3 mM) with the TNP (1 mg/ml) in HEPES buffer
(20 mM, pH = 7.0) at room temperature for 3 h. The DOX
loaded into the TNP was isolated from the free DOX in the
solution by a Sephadex G75 column method as previously
reported [38].

Cytotoxicity determination by MTT assay
The modified MTT colorimetric assay was used
to detect the sensitivity of cells to anticancer drugs
in vitro [51]. Cells were seeded in 180 μl of medium
in 96-well plates in triplicate at 5000–6000 cells/well.
After incubation at 37ºC for 24 h, the cells were treated
with different concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs
(20 μl/well). After 72 h of incubation at 37ºC, 20 μl of
MTT solution (4 mg/ml) was added to each well. The
plates were further incubated at 37ºC for 4 h, allowing
viable cells to change the yellow-colored MTT into darkblue formazan crystals. Subsequently, the MTT/medium
was removed from each well without disturbing the cells,
and 100 μl of DMSO was added into each well. Plates
were placed on a shaking table to thoroughly mix the
formazan into the solvent. Finally, the absorbance was
determined at 570 nm by Opsys microplate reader (Dynex
Technologies, Chantilly, VA).

Establishing the tumor xenograft mouse model
Male athymic NCR (nu/nu) nude mice (NCRNU M,
homozygous, albino; 18–25 g; 6–10 week; Taconic
Farms) were used for the tumor xenograft experiments.
All animals were maintained on an alternating 12 hours
light/dark cycle with ad libitum water and rodent chow.
The SW620 and SW/Ad300 mouse models were designed
for the first time with a slight modification to the KBv200
cell xenograft model previously established by Chen and
colleagues [52, 53]. SW620 and SW/Ad300 (5.0 × 106)
cells were injected subcutaneously under the armpits.
When the subcutaneous tumors reached approximately
5 × 5 mm in size, the mice were randomized into four
treatment groups. There were 4 experimental groups
with 8 mice in each group. Group 1 animals received the
vehicle treatment. Group 2 animals received 0.71 mg/kg
TNP. Group 3 animals received the anticancer drug
2.00 mg/kg DOX. Group 4 animals received DOX-TNP.
All injections were prepared in 10 mM HEPES buffer and
administered intra-peritoneally every 3 days. The tumor
sizes were measured using calipers and body weights
were recorded [54]. The body weights of the animals
were monitored every 3 days to adjust the drug dosage

Western blot analysis
Equal amounts of total cell lysates (60 μg
protein) and Full-Range Rainbow Molecular Weight

and to determine the treatment-related toxicities as well
as disease progression. The two perpendicular diameters
of tumors were recorded every 3 days and tumor volumes
were estimated [52, 54]. Blood plasma was collected at
the end of experiments before euthanizing by carbon
dioxide. Various organs and tumor tissue were excised and
stored at −80ºC. All mice were maintained at the St. John’s
University Animal Facility. This research was approved by
the IACUC at St. John’s University. All experiments were
conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act
and other federal regulations. The animals were treated
humanely and cared for in accordance with guidelines set
forth by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care and the U.S. Public Health Service
Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

rate of 1 ml/min, monitored with absorbance at 480 nm
and 215 nm, simultaneously. The peak areas for the DOX
fractions were recorded, and the concentration of DOX in
the supernatant was quantitatively determined according
to its calibration curve for peak area vs. concentration.

Blood cell counting
Blood was drawn up to the 0.5 mark in a RBC
pipette and diluted using Platelet Diluent. The sample was
shaken for approximately 1 min. The fluid was expelled
from the capillary end of the pipette. The chamber and
coverslip were cleaned to ensure they are free of artifacts.
The chamber was then charged and the cells were allowed
to settle (15–20 min) before counting. Then, venous or
capillary blood was drawn to the 0.5 mark in a WBC
pipette and diluted using WBC Diluent. Again, the
chamber was charged and the cells were allowed to settle
before the number of WBCs in the four corners 1 mm2
area was counted.

Collection of plasma and tissues for
pharmacokinetics study
In a separate group of experiments, mice bearing
SW620 and SW620/Ad300 tumors were divided into
two groups: (i) DOX; (ii) DOX-TNP. After treatment, the
animals were anesthetized and blood was obtained using
supraorbital punctures and placed in heparinized tubes.
Plasma was harvested at 10, 30, 60, 120, or 240 min
intervals after paclitaxel administration in both groups. In
addition, the tumors and lungs were removed, weighed,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80ºC until
analysis [55].

Mouse cardiac troponin-I ELISA assay
The plasma with heparin was prepared as quickly
as possible after blood collection and stored at 4ºC. The
desired number of coated wells in the holder was secured
and 100 μl of cTnl HRP Conjugate was dispensed into
each well. Then 100 μl of standards and diluted samples
were dispensed into appropriate wells and thoroughly
mixed and incubated on an orbital shaker (150 rpm)
at room temperature (18–25ºC) for 60 min. Later, the
incubation mixture was removed by flicking the plate
contents into a waste container. The microtiter wells
were washed and emptied 6 times with 1x wash solution.
The entire wash procedure was performed as quickly as
possible. After washing, the wells were struck sharply onto
absorbent paper to remove all residual droplets. 100 μl of
TMB reagent were dispensed into each well and incubated
at room temperature for 20 min on an orbital shaker at
~150 rpm. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl
Stop Solution to each well. The mixture was gently mixed
and the absorbance was read at 450 nm with a microtiter
well reader within 5 min of mixing.

Extraction of doxorubicin from plasma and
tissue homogenate samples
A simple, one-step protein precipitation with
acetonitrile was used for sample preparation. Tumor tissues
were homogenized in saline (1:2, v/v). Doxorubicin was
extracted from plasma and tissue homogenate samples by
precipitation with acetonitrile in 1:1 and 1:2 ratios (v/v),
respectively. Samples were vortexed for 1 min, followed by
centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant
was transferred to insert vials, from which 20 ml was
injected onto the high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) column. Samples with concentrations higher than
the calibration range limit were appropriately diluted to fit
within the working calibration curve.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis
The deparaffinization was performed for the
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. After
that, the slides were placed in peroxidase quenching
solution for 20–30 min and then placed in distilled water
for 2 min. To retrieve the epitopes, 200 ml epitope retrieval
buffer was placed in to a container and preheated. Slides
were placed into the container steamed for 20–30 min.
To block the non-specific reaction, tissue sections were
circled with a hydrophobic barrier pen. Two drops (100 μl)
of serum blocking solution were added to completely
cover the tissue and the sections were incubated for

High-performance liquid chromatography
conditions
To evaluate the concentration of DOX within the
blood sample, the extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm
for 2 min and the supernatant was then loaded (100 μl per
injection) onto a BioSep-SEC-s4000 column (300 mm ×
7.8 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) that was mounted on
an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Santa Clara, CA).
The loaded sample was eluted with PBS, pH 7.4, at a flow

1 hour at room temperature. Later, the solution was
drained and 2 drops (100 μl) of primary antibody were
applied to completely cover the tissue and the sections
were incubated at 4ºC overnight.
The next day, the slides were rinsed with PBS 3
times with 2 min each. Two drops (100 μl) of secondary
antibody were applied to completely cover the tissue
and incubate at 37ºC for 30 min. Then the slides were
rinsed with PBS 3 times with 2 min each. For the enzyme
conjugate, 2 drops (100 μl) of enzyme conjugate were
applied to completely cover the tissue on each section
and the sections were incubated at 37ºC for 20 min. Then
the slides were rinsed with PBS 3 times for 2 min each.
For color development, the sections were incubated with
DAB solution and developed 2–10 min under microscope
control. The slides were washed with tap water and
submerged in distilled water for 5 min. The slides were
also submerged in Mayer’s hematoxylin for 10–30
seconds for counterstaining. The slides were then washed
with tap water for 5 min and submerged in distilled water
for 5 min. Finally, dehydration, clearing and mounting
were conducted.
