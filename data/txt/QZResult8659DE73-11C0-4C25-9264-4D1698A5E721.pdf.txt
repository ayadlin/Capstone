Abstract
The prostaglandin F2A (PGF2A) receptor (FP) is elevated in
endometrial adenocarcinoma. This study found that PGF2A
signaling via FP regulates expression of chemokine (C-X-C
motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells.
Expression of CXCL1 and its receptor, CXCR2, are elevated in
cancer tissue compared with normal endometrium and
localized to glandular epithelium, endothelium, and stroma.
Treatment of Ishikawa cells stably transfected with the FP
receptor (FPS cells) with 100 nmol/L PGF2A increased CXCL1
promoter activity, mRNA, and protein expression, and these
effects were abolished by cotreatment of cells with FP
antagonist or chemical inhibitors of Gq, epidermal growth
factor receptor, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase.
Similarly, CXCL1 was elevated in response to 100 nmol/L
PGF2A in endometrial adenocarcinoma explant tissue. CXCL1
is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. The expression of
CXCR2 colocalized to neutrophils in endometrial adenocarcinoma and increased neutrophils were present in endometrial
adenocarcinoma compared with normal endometrium. Conditioned media from PGF2A-treated FPS cells stimulated
neutrophil chemotaxis, which could be abolished by CXCL1
protein immunoneutralization of the conditioned media or
antagonism of CXCR2. Finally, xenograft tumors in nude mice
arising from inoculation with FPS cells showed increased
neutrophil infiltration compared with tumors arising from
wild-type cells or following treatment of mice bearing FPS
tumors with CXCL1-neutralizing antibody. In conclusion, our
results show a novel PGF2A-FP pathway that may regulate the
inflammatory microenvironment in endometrial adenocarcinoma via neutrophil chemotaxis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5726–33]

Introduction
Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common gynecological
malignancy in Western countries, affecting mainly postmenopausal
women with a frequency of 15 to 20 per 100,000 women per year
(1). Overexpression of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and
prostaglandins has been shown in endometrial adenocarcinoma as

well as a number of other cancer types and gynecological
pathologies (2, 3).
In the reproductive tract, the most commonly synthesized
prostaglandins are the E- and F-series prostanoids (4). These are
synthesized from arachidonic acid by COX enzymes and prostaglandin synthases, and are then transported out of the cell by a
prostaglandin transporter (5) to act in an autocrine/paracrine
manner on G-protein–coupled receptors. The G-protein–coupled
receptor for PGF2a (FP) is a Gq coupled receptor, which upon
activation leads to release of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and
diacylglycerol (6). Recently, we have shown a role for FP in
endometrial adenocarcinoma, with evidence for elevated PGF2a-FP
signaling up-regulating angiogenic and tumorigenic genes including COX-2 (7), FGF2 (8), and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; ref. 9), and increasing proliferation and migration of
neoplastic epithelial cells (10–12).
Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1, also known as
growth-regulated oncogene a) has angiogenic, chemoattractant,
and inflammatory activities (13). A link between prostaglandins
and CXCL1 has been shown, as prostaglandin E2 signaling induces
CXCL1 expression in colorectal cancer cell lines (14). CXCL1 is upregulated in melanoma (15, 16), colorectal (17, 18), and prostate
cancer (19) and binds to the CXCR2 receptor (20) to promote the
recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation (21). Although
the role of neutrophils in cancer is unclear, recent evidence
suggests that they may promote tissue remodeling by production of
proteases including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (22) and
angiogenic factors such as VEGF (23), in addition to their classic
role as the first line of defense against invading pathogens (24).
In this study, we used a chemokine antibody array to identify
CXCL1 as a target gene of PGF2a. We investigated the expression,
localization, and regulation of CXCL1 expression mediated via
PGF2a-FP signaling in endometrial adenocarcinoma and its
downstream regulation of neutrophil influx into endometrial
tumors in vitro and in endometrial tumor xenografts in vivo.

PGF2a-FP Signaling Promotes Neutrophil Chemotaxis
patients were prediagnosed to have adenocarcinoma of the uterus, and
diagnosis was confirmed histologically in all cases. Normal endometrial
tissue was collected from women undergoing surgery for minor gynecologic
procedures with no underlying endometrial pathology. Ethical approval was
obtained from Lothian Research Ethics Committee, and written informed
consent was obtained from all subjects before tissue collection.
Cell lines, culture, and treatments. Wild-type (WT) Ishikawa cells and
Ishikawa cells engineered to stably express the full-length human FP
receptor to the levels observed in endometrial adenocarcinomas, called FPS
cells, were cultured as described previously (9). Transient transfections were
performed using Superfect (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The
optimal concentrations of all chemical inhibitors and antibodies were
determined empirically by titration using the manufacturer’s guidelines as
described in our previous studies (25). Cell viability was determined for each
inhibitor using the CellTitre 96 AQueous One Solution assay (Promega) as
described in our previous studies (10, 25). Within the time frame of
incubation in this study, the inhibitors had no adverse effect on cell viability,
at the concentration used. Cells were treated with vehicle, inhibitor alone,
or 100 nmol/L PGF2a alone or in the presence of YM254890 (1 Amol/L),
AL8810 (50 Amol/L), 43CMQ (1 Amol/L), AG1478 (200 nmol/L), or
Cyclosporine A (CsA; 1 Amol/L) for the time indicated.
Chemokine antibody array. Conditioned medium (CM) was prepared as
described (8). Briefly, FPS cells were stimulated with vehicle or 100 nmol/L
PGF2a for 24 h. The CM (V-CM or P-CM, respectively) was analyzed for
cytokine expression using the RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody Array 3 kit,
following manufacturer’s protocol.
CXCL1 luciferase reporter assays. The CXCL1 reporter plasmid
consisting of the CXCL1 promoter fused to the firefly luciferase reporter
(as described in ref. 26) was kindly supplied by Professor Ann Richmond
(Department of Cell Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine,
Nashville, Tennessee). The CXCL1 promoter firefly luciferase reporter was
transfected into FPS cells with pRL-TK (containing the renilla luciferase
coding sequence; Promega) as an internal control. FPS cells were
cotransfected with control vector (pcDNA3.0) or vector encoding a
dominant negative (DN) isoform of EGFR, Ras, MAP/ERK kinase (MEK),
or NFAT (kindly supplied by Professor Zvi Naor, Tel Aviv University, Israel).
The DN constructs have been previously characterized and described (27,
28). Cells were stimulated with vehicle or 100 nmol/L PGF2a for the time
indicated in the figure legend. The activity of firefly and renilla was
determined using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and total
luciferase activity determined relative to the internal renilla control. Data
are expressed as fold increase in luciferase activity compared with vehicletreated cells and are presented as mean F SE from at least three
independent experiments.
Taqman quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. CXCL1 and CXCR2
expression in endometrial tissues and FPS cells was measured by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis as described previously
(1, 2). FPS cells were treated with vehicle, 100 nmol/L PGF2a alone or in the
presence of inhibitor, or vehicle and inhibitor alone for 8 h. RNA samples
were then extracted using Tri-reagent following manufacturer’s guidelines.
RNA samples were reverse transcribed and RT-PCR performed as described
previously (1, 2) using sequence specific primers and probes: CXCL1
forward, 5¶-GTT TTC AAA TGT TCT CCA GTC ATT ATG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-CCG
CCA GCC TCT ATC ACA GT-3¶; probe, 5¶-TTC TGA GGA GCC TGC AAC
ATG CCA-3¶; CXCR2 forward, 5¶-TGC TCT TCT GGA GGT GTC CTA CA-3¶;
reverse, 5¶-AGA TCT TCA CCT TTC CAG AAA TCT T-3¶; probe, 5¶-CCC AGC
GAC CCA GTC AGG ATT TAA-3¶. Primers and data were analyzed and
processed using Sequence Detector v1.6.3 (Applied Biosystems). Expression
of analyzed genes was normalized to RNA loading for each sample using
the 18S rRNA as an internal standard. Results are expressed as fold increase
above cells treated with vehicle and inhibitor. Data are presented as
mean F SE from at least three independent experiments.
CXCL1 ELISA. CXCL1 protein secretion by FPS cells in the culture media
was measured by the Human CXCL1 Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D systems).
FPS cells were treated as described above for mRNA, for time indicated
in the figure legend. The ELISA was then carried out according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance of wells was determined by

www.aacrjournals.org

spectrophotometry at 450 nm. Data are presented as mean F SE from at
least three independent experiments.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Expression of CXCL1, neutrophil
elastase, CXCR2, and Gr-1 was localized in endometrial tissue and
xenografts by immunohistochemistry using standard techniques as
described previously (1, 2). Briefly, following antigen retrieval, sections
were blocked in 5% normal rabbit serum (CXCL1 and Gr-1) or normal goat
serum (CXCR2 and neutrophil elastase) diluted in TBS with 5% BSA.
Subsequently, tissue sections were incubated with goat anti-human CXCL1
polyclonal antibody (2 Ag/mL), mouse anti-human CXCR2 (5 Ag/mL),
mouse anti-human neutrophil elastase monoclonal antibody (2 Ag/mL), or
rat anti-mouse Gr-1 (5 Ag/mL) overnight at 4jC. Control sections included
the following: no primary antibody, nonimmune goat, mouse and rat IgG, or
CXCL1 antibody preabsorbed with blocking peptide (20 Ag/mL; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Subsequently, sections were incubated with rabbit antigoat/rat biotinylated or goat anti-mouse biotinylated antibodies (DAKO),
followed by streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase complex (DAKO). Color
reaction was developed with 3¶3 diaminobenzidine (DAKO). Sections were
counterstained in hemotoxylin. Images were obtained on a PROVIS
microscope at 200 or 400 magnification (Olympus Optical) using Canon
EOS image capture software (Canon). The number of neutrophils was
quantified using neutrophil elastase staining and standard stereological
techniques. Briefly, each section was examined using 40 plan apo objective
from a BH2 microscope (Olympus) fitted with an automatic stage (Prior
Scientific Instruments Ltd.) using a video camera (HV-C20; Hitachi) and
analyzed with Image-ProPlus 4.5.1 software with a Stereology 5.0 plug-in
(Media Cybernetics). A total of 40 randomized fields of view were examined
and counted (n = 7 normal endometrium; n = 30 carcinoma), and data are
expressed as mean number of cells per mm2 of tumor examined.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. CXCR2 expression was colocalized
with neutrophil elastase by immunofluorescence microscopy as described
previously (8, 29). Briefly, sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum
diluted in PBS with 5% BSA before incubation with mouse anti-neutrophil
elastase (1 Ag/mL). Following overnight incubation at 4jC, sections were
incubated with goat-anti mouse biotinylated Fab, then tyramide signal
amplification kit (TSA Fluorescein System; 1:50 dilution; Perkin-Elmer).
Sections were then microwaved in 0.01 M citrate buffer for 30 min and
endogenous peroxidase blocked using hydrogen peroxide. Nonspecific
binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum and sections were
incubated with mouse anti-CXCR2 antibody (1 Ag/mL) at 4jC overnight.
Sections were again incubated with goat-anti-mouse biotinylated Fab and
tyramide signal amplification kit. Nuclei were stained using ToPro
(Molecular Probes). Fluorescent images were visualized and photographed
using a Carl Zeiss laser scanning microscope LSM510 (400 objective; Jena).
Neutrophil chemotaxis assay. Neutrophil chemotaxis was analyzed
using transwell inserts (5-Am pore size; Corning Costar). Neutrophils were
purified as previously described (30) and resuspended in serum free media.
Cells (750,000) were added to the top chamber of the transwell insert and
600 AL of V-CM or P-CM was added to the bottom chamber. Serum-free
media alone or with 50,000 pg/mL CXCL1 were added as negative and
positive controls, respectively. Cells were incubated at 37jC in a 5% CO2
atmosphere for 1 h and the plate was gently tapped to dislodge cells
adhered to the underside of the membrane. Cells in the bottom chamber
were collected and counted at least six times using a haemocytometer. Data
are expressed as mean F SE from at least three independent experiments.
Xenograft tumor model. A suspension of 500,000 Ishikawa WT or FPS
cells in a total volume of 0.2 mL DMEM was injected s.c. into each dorsal
flank of CD1-Foxn1nu mice (Charles River). The mice (n = 30) were divided
into two groups of equal tumor size after engraftment (1 wk). The mice were
injected twice weekly with 100 Ag IgG (WT and FPS) or CXCL1 neutralizing
antibody (FPS) via i.p. injection for 4 wk. One tumor from each mouse was
placed in PBS for flow cytometry analysis and RNA extracted from the
second tumor from each mouse. The animals were maintained under sterile
conditions in individually vented cages.
Flow cytometry analysis. Xenografts from nude mice were assessed for
immune cell infiltrate using flow cytometry (n = 15). Briefly, tumors were
digested by collagenase treatment at 37jC for 45 min. Tissue was then

mechanically disrupted into a single-cell solution using a syringe and 40 Am
mesh and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) wash
(PBS + 1%BSA + 2% formalin). Cells were incubated at 4jC for 30 min in
FACS wash containing the following monoclonal antibodies and appropriate isotype controls: FITC-CD11b, PE-Gr-1, and Cy5-CD11c. RBC were lysed
using BD FACS lysing solution according to manufacturer’s instructions (BD
Biosciences). Samples were analyzed using a FACScalibur cytometer (BD
biosystems) using BD CellQuest software. Neutrophils were defined by
expression of Gr-1 and CD11b epitope, absence of CD11c, and scatter
profile.
Statistical analysis. Where appropriate, data were subjected to
statistical analysis with ANOVA and Student’s t test (GraphPad Prism).

Results
CXCL1 expression in FPS cells. Changes in cytokine expression
in FPS cells in response to PGF2a treatment were examined by
cytokine antibody array (Fig. 1A). A combined up-regulation of
CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 as well as CXCL1 alone was observed
following 100 nmol/L PGF2a treatment of FPS cells for 24 hours
compared with vehicle-treated cells. To verify this finding, the
promoter activity (Fig. 1B), mRNA (Fig. 1C), and protein (Fig. 1D)
expression of CXCL1 in response to PGF2a treatment was
examined. All were significantly increased (P < 0.01) in response
to PGF2a treatment in a time-dependent manner compared with
vehicle-treated cells.
Involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor and MEK
signaling in CXCL1 production. To determine signaling pathways
mediating CXCL1 production in FPS cells, we treated cells with
vehicle, 100 nmol/L PGF2a alone or with a panel of chemical
inhibitors of cell signaling, or inhibitor alone (Fig. 2). Treatment of
FPS cells with PGF2a for 8 and 24 hours induced a 91.5- F 8.4-fold

and 22.3- F 4.7-fold increase in CXCL1 mRNA and protein
expression, respectively, compared with vehicle treated cells
(Fig. 2A and B). This increase was abolished by treatment of cells
with a selective inhibitor of Gq (YM254890; P < 0.01) and
significantly inhibited with the FP receptor antagonist AL8810
(P < 0.05) and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR; AG1478; P < 0.05) and MEK (PD98059; P < 0.01). Inhibitors
of calcineurin (CsA) and protein kinase A (43CMQ) did not
significantly affect CXCL1 mRNA and protein production.
We confirmed a role for EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) in PGF2a-mediated CXCL1 production by cotransfecting FPS cells with the CXCL1 promoter and either an empty vector
(pcDNA3.0) or DN EGFR, DNRas, DNMEK, or DN-Nuclear factor of
activated T-cells (NFAT; Fig. 2C). Treatment of control-vector–
transfected cells with 100 nmol/L PGF2a showed an elevation of
CXCL1 promoter activity of 18.9- F 3.6-fold, which was significantly reduced by cotransfection of cells with DN-EGFR (P < 0.05),
DN-ras (P < 0.01), and DN-MEK (P < 0.01), but no significant
difference was shown when cells were transfected with DN-NFAT.
CXCL1 and CXCR2 expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma and normal endometrium. Because we had ascertained a
role for the FP receptor in regulating CXCL1 in an endometrial
adenocarcinoma cell line, we next investigated the expression and
regulation of CXCL1 in endometrial adenocarcinoma explants by
PGF2a. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed an increase in the
expression of CXCL1 and its receptor CXCR2 mRNA expression in
human endometrial adenocarcinoma tissue (n = 58) compared
with normal endometrium (n = 45; 5.9- and 4.2-fold, respectively;
P < 0.001; Fig. 3A and B). We investigated whether CXCL1
expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma explants was regulated
via FP and MEK signaling pathways. Carcinoma tissue was treated

with PGF2a up to 72 h. Columns, mean of
at least three independent experiments.

with PGF2a in the absence/presence of AL8810 and PD98059 for
24 hours. CXCL1 mRNA was found to be elevated 5.3- F 0.8-fold
in response to PGF2a (P < 0.05). Cotreatment of tissue with AL8810
or PD988059 significantly reduced this increase in CXCL1 expression (P < 0.05).
Localization of CXCL1 and CXCR2 in endometrial adenocarcinoma. The site of expression of CXCL1 and CXCR2 protein in
carcinoma tissue was then determined by immunohistochemistry
(Fig. 4A). CXCL1 and CXCR2 immunoreactivity was localized to
glandular epithelium, vascular endothelial cells, and stroma in all
well, moderately, and poorly differentiated carcinoma sections
studied (n = 4 each group).
Using serial sectioning, CXCL1 expression could be localized to
the same glandular epithelial and vascular endothelial cells as the
FP receptor (Fig. 4B, arrowheads). CXCL1 has been previously
described as a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. We next
colocalized CXCR2 expression throughout the stroma with
expression of neutrophil elastase, a neutrophil marker, in
endometrial adenocarcinoma using dual immunofluorescence
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4C). No immunoreactivity was observed in sections incubated with nonimmune IgG. The number of
neutrophils present in endometrial tissue was then quantified
using immunohistochemistry for neutrophil elastase (Fig. 4D) and
was found to be 13.9- F 2.3-fold higher in cancer compared with
sections of normal endometrium (P < 0.01).
PGF2A-stimulated CXCL1 induces neutrophil chemotaxis
in vitro and in vivo. We next determined whether the CXCL1
expressed in FPS cells via PGF2a-FP receptor interaction could
induce neutrophil chemotaxis. Human neutrophils were purified
from peripheral blood and used in a chemotaxis assay. We found a
significant increase in neutrophil chemotaxis in response to
conditioned media from FPS cells treated with 100 nmol/L PGF2a
(P-CM) compared with vehicle-treated cells (V-CM; Fig. 5A). This
effect was significantly inhibited with immunoneutralization of
CXCL1 before incubation with neutrophils or with the addition of
the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 to P-CM (P < 0.001).
To explore whether FP receptor signaling could promote
neutrophil migration in vivo, we injected WT or FPS cells s.c. in
nude mice. Mice were then regularly injected with control IgG
(WT and FPS xenografts) or CXCL1 antibody (FPS xenografts).
Tumors formed from FPS cells expressed significantly higher
CXCL1 mRNA compared with WT tumors (Fig. 5B) and, when
analyzed by flow cytometry, had increased neutrophil infiltration
(P < 0.001; Fig. 5C). This infiltration was significantly decreased in
FPS xenografts injected with CXCL1 neutralizing antibody
compared with those treated with nonimmune IgG (P < 0.001).
This analysis was confirmed further by immunohistochemistry
(Fig. 5D), where increased neutrophils were seen distributed
throughout FPS xenografts compared with WT or CXCL immunoneutralized FPS xenografts.

Figure 2. CXCL1 production in FPS cells is mediated by EGFR, Ras, and MEK.
A, CXCL1 mRNA production, measured by quantitative RT-PCR, was increased
after 8 h of PGF2a treatment. This was decreased by cotreatment with
YM254890, AL8810, AG1478, and PD98059. No reduction was seen after
cotreatment with CsA or 4C3MQ. B, CXCL1 protein secretion after 24 h of
PGF2a treatment was reduced after cotreatment with YM254890, AL8810,
AG1478, and PD98059. No reduction was seen after cotreatment with CsA or
4C3MQ. C, CXCL1 promoter activity was measured in cells treated with PGF2a
alone or with DN-EGFR, DN-Ras, DN-MEK, or DN-NFAT. Significant reduction in
activity was seen after 8 h with all constructs except DN-NFAT. Columns,
mean of at least three independent experiments; **, P < 0.01.

Discussion
The link between inflammation and tumor progression has
been shown in a range of studies. For example, elevated
expression of inflammatory COX-2 and prostaglandins has been
correlated with tumor growth and angiogenesis in prostate,
pancreatic, and colon cancer (31–33), and the risk of long-term
inflammation has been shown by studies showing that continued
use of specific COX-2 inhibitors nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs can significantly reduce cancer occurrence in patients at
high risk (34). In the present study, we show that PGF2a-FP
signaling can regulate expression of the inflammatory chemokine
CXCL1 in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells to modulate
neutrophil influx in tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to provide a link between inflammatory prostanoids,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

specifically PGF2a, and neutrophil recruitment in endometrial
cancers.
Prostaglandins have been shown to regulate chemokine
expression in vitro (35, 36). Prostaglandin E2 is overexpressed in
many cancer types and has been shown to induce CXCL1
production in colon cancer cells, which can then promote tube
formation and migration of endothelial cells (14). We have
previously ascertained a role for the FP receptor and PGF2a
signaling in regulating endometrial adenocarcinoma (8–11). In the
present study, we investigated a role for the FP receptor in
modulating the expression of chemokines using an in vitro model
system of Ishikawa cells stably expressing the human FP receptor
(FPS cells; ref. 9) and a human cytokine antibody array. The array
identified CXCL1 as a key cytokine induced by PGF2a-FP signaling.
Using FPS cells, which we have previously shown to reproduce the
ex vivo effects of PGF2a on endometrial adenocarcinoma tissue
explants (9), we elaborated the signaling pathways mediating the
role of FP on CXCL1 expression using chemical inhibitors and DN
mutants of cell signaling pathways. A key effector pathway that has
been previously shown to regulate tumorigenic signaling molecules
in response to G-protein–coupled receptor signaling is the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The signaling
components of this pathway in FPS cells have been identified in
our laboratory, where the phosphorylation of the downstream
component of the MAPK pathway, ERK1/2, was shown to be
mediated by EGFR trans-activation and c-src phosphorylation (9).
We found that chemical inhibitors of EGFR and MEK could inhibit
CXCL1 production, as did cotransfection of DN EGFR, Ras, and
MEK. However, NFAT, a common regulator of cytokine expression
(37), was not involved in PGF2a-mediated CXCL1 production in this
cell type. These data are supported by previously published
evidence in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines where the ERK
pathway was also shown to be crucial in the regulation of CXCL1
expression after stimulation with prostaglandin E2 (14).
Overexpression of CXCL1 has previously been shown in a variety
of tumor types, including colorectal (18) and melanoma (15), and
promotes a variety of cellular functions including cell proliferation
in esophageal cancer (38) and cell invasion in bladder cancer (39).
Here, we showed elevated expression of CXCL1 and its receptor
CXCR2 in endometrial adenocarcinoma compared with normal
endometrium. Expression of both was localized to glandular
epithelium, stroma, and vascular endothelial cells. In addition,
treatment of endometrial adenocarcinoma explants with PGF2a
caused an increase in CXCL1 expression via FP receptor and ERK1/2
signaling pathways confirming the importance of this signaling
cascade in regulating CXCL1 expression ex vivo. CXCR2 localization
in neutrophils in endometrial adenocarcinoma suggested that
CXCL1 via CXCR2 could play a role in immune cell function. A
role for CXCL1 in neutrophil influx has been previously shown in an
angiogenic sponge model in the mouse, as endogenous CXCL1
expression increased immediately preceding a neutrophil influx (40).
Here, we show by immunohistochemistry that neutrophils are
elevated in human endometrial adenocarcinomas. We have also
confirmed that CXCL1 is strongly chemotactic to neutrophils as
conditioned media from PGF2a-stimulated FPS cells induced
chemotaxis of peripheral neutrophils. This chemotaxis was
significantly reduced by CXCL1 immunoneutralization and CXCR2
inhibition using a specific antagonist. To determine a role for
CXCL1 induced by PGF2a-FP interaction in vivo, we inoculated nude
mice with FPS and WT cells. The increased neutrophils in the
resulting FPS tumors compared with WT were significantly reduced

PGF2a-FP Signaling Promotes Neutrophil Chemotaxis

by injection of CXCL1 neutralizing antibodies, demonstrating that
PGF2a signaling via CXCL1 is influencing neutrophil cell infiltrate in
endometrial adenocarcinomas. Neutrophil infiltration into tumors
has also been shown to be dependent on CXC chemokine-CXCR2
signaling in a model of melanoma in a CXCR2 null nude mouse (41).
A chemokine-mediated influx of neutrophils is seen in the late
secretory phase of the normal endometrium (42). Their role may be
dependent on the activating agents and cytokines present, but they
are thought to be involved in the breakdown and repair at
menstruation by degranulation and the release of proteases that
degrade the extracellular matrix (43). They may also be capable of
remodeling vasculature, as neutrophils found close to or associated
with endothelial microvessels express VEGF during or coincident
with angiogenesis in the normal menstrual cycle (44).
The role of neutrophils in endometrial adenocarcinoma is
unclear, and in our study, similar to other reports (45, 46),
neutrophil influx in our xenograft model did not effect on tumor
size. However, considering their profound tissue-remodeling
capabilities, which have been shown in a number of animal
models of other cancer types, it is possible that they play a similar
role in endometrial cancer. For example, neutrophils have been
shown to uniquely produce a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase–
free MMP-9, a key protease involved in extracellular matrix

degradation, which may affect the tumor microenvironment by
tissue remodeling (24). In addition, the depletion of neutrophils in
a mouse model was shown to prevent metastasis of fibrosarcoma
cells from the primary tumor (45), suggesting a role for neutrophils
in the switch to a metastatic phenotype. In a nude mouse model
of breast cancer, overexpression of interleukin-8, a chemokine
related to CXCL1, caused an infiltration of neutrophils, which
increased invasiveness of the tumor, likely due to an increase in
protease production (47). Similarly, the decrease in neutrophil
infiltration caused by an inhibition of CXCL1 expression in a nude
mouse model of colon cancer significantly decreased metastasis in
these animals (48). Furthermore, neutrophils may also promote
tumorigenesis through means other than tissue remodeling. In an
in vitro model of colon cancer, neutrophils promote cellular stress
by inducing transient errors in DNA replication in epithelial cells
(49), which could ultimately lead to carcinogenesis, whereas
neutrophils from ovarian cancer patients released higher levels of
reactive oxygen species, which could potentially lead to cellular
changes that support tumor progression (50).
In conclusion, we provide evidence for a novel PGF2a-FP
pathway that can regulate the inflammatory microenvironment
in endometrial adenocarcinoma via CXCL1-induced neutrophil
chemotaxis.
