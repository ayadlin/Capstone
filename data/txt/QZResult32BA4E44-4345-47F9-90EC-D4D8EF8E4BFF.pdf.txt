Abstract
Antitumor immunity is strongly inﬂuenced by the balance of tumor antigen-speciﬁc effector T cells (Teff) and
regulatory T cells (Treg). However, the impact that vaccine adjuvants have in regulating the balance of antigenspeciﬁc T-cell populations is not well understood. We found that antigen-speciﬁc Tregs were induced following
subcutaneous vaccination with either OVA or melanoma-derived peptides, with a restricted expansion of Teffs.
Addition of the adjuvants CpG-ODN or Poly(I:C) preferentially ampliﬁed Teffs over Tregs, dramatically increasing
the antigen-speciﬁc Teff:Treg ratios and inducing polyfunctional effector cells. In contrast, two other adjuvants,
imiquimod and Quil A saponin, favored an expansion of antigen-speciﬁc Tregs and failed to increase Teff:Treg
ratios. Following therapeutic vaccination of tumor-bearing mice, high ratios of tumor-speciﬁc Teffs:Tregs in
draining lymph nodes were associated with enhanced CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration at the tumor site and a durable
rejection of tumors. Vaccine formulations of peptideþCpG-ODN or Poly(I:C) induced selective production of
proinﬂammatory type I cytokines early after vaccination. This environment promoted CD8þ and CD4þ Teff
expansion over that of antigen-speciﬁc Tregs, tipping the Teff to Treg balance to favor effector cells. Our ﬁndings
advance understanding of the inﬂuence of different adjuvants on T-cell populations, facilitating the rational
design of more effective cancer vaccines. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6597–608. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The development of therapeutic cancer vaccines is a challenging task, and generating clinically relevant, potent, and
polyfunctional T-cell responses to tumor/self-antigens has
proven difﬁcult. Therapeutic peptide vaccines stimulate antitumor immune responses in patients with advanced melanoma (1, 2), but clinical beneﬁts have not lived up to the
expectations (3, 4). For therapeutic vaccines to be effective,
they must circumvent regulatory mechanisms that limit the
activation and expansion of CD8þ and CD4þ T cells. Regulatory
T cells (Treg) play a major role in the control of antitumor
immunity (5–7) and existing cancer vaccines activate and
expand Tregs, resulting in suppression of antitumor responses
(8–10). Thus, the need to enhance immunogenicity of peptide
vaccines is paramount. Adjuvants provide a means to improve
the generation of potent and durable T-cell immunity by

cancer vaccines (11). A greater understanding of the role of
adjuvants in modulating T-cell responses and in particular
Tregs is therefore urgently needed. The rational development
of new adjuvant formulations to augment T-cell responses is
key in cancer vaccine development. Adjuvants that strongly
stimulate T-cell responses are still not readily available and the
major clinically licensed adjuvants Alum and incomplete
Freund's adjuvant (IFA) primarily promote antibody responses
but are poor at inducing the cytotoxic CD8þ T-cell responses
needed in the case of cancer (12).
Members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-ligand class of
adjuvants, including CpG-ODN (TLR-9), LPS (TLR-4), and
Pam3Cys (TLR-2), induce antigen-presenting cell (APC) maturation and production of inﬂammatory cytokines, favoring
type I effector T cell (Teff) responses and restricting Treg
expansion (13–15). Conﬂicting data show that TLR agonists
CpG-ODN, LPS, Zymozan (TLR-6), Poly(I:C) [TLR3], Imiquimod and R-848 (TLR-7/8) can expand both Teffs and Tregs
leading to suppression of effector responses (16–18). In the
studies mentioned above, CD8þ T-cell responses were compared with those of polyclonal Tregs. Very few studies have
investigated the effect of adjuvants on antigen-speciﬁc Tregs.
An ex vivo study from patients with colorectal carcinoma
identiﬁed shared antigen-speciﬁcities between tumor-speciﬁc
Teffs and Tregs. These Tregs were shown to suppress proliferation of Teffs in an antigen-speciﬁc manner when cultured
with tumor peptide-loaded dendritic cells (19). In a clinical
study of patients with melanoma immunized with NY-ESO-1
protein in ISCOMATRIX, vaccination increased the frequency
of NY-ESO-1–speciﬁc Tregs in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) and tumor tissue (20). We have shown that

therapeutic vaccination of patients with melanoma with
Melan-A peptide plus CpG-ODN in Montanide results in robust
expansion of Melan-A–speciﬁc CD8þ T cells within PBMCs
with a concomitant decrease in Melan-A–speciﬁc Tregs (1,
2, 21). Importantly, although we observed a decrease in vaccine-speciﬁc Tregs, the total polyclonal Treg population
remained unchanged. These results suggest that antigen-speciﬁc Tregs are regulated differently than polyclonal Tregs
following adjuvanted-peptide vaccination, and that adjuvant
choice may be important in selectively controlling the speciﬁc
Treg response.
We therefore set out to extend these clinical observations
using mouse models of peptide vaccination to dissect the role
of vaccine formulations in shaping the antitumor immune
response. We developed models that allowed us to compare
tumor-speciﬁc CD8, CD4, and Treg responses to peptide
vaccination in various adjuvant formulations. Here, we show
that vaccines containing TLR-9 ligand CpG-ODN or TLR-3
ligand Poly(I:C) preferentially induce strong proliferation of
antigen-speciﬁc Teffs, while minimizing antigen-speciﬁc Treg
expansion. High Teff:Treg ratios were linked to strong proinﬂammatory cytokine production in the lymph nodes early after
immunization and resulted in polyfunctional CTLs with
enhanced tumor inﬁltration and protective function.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Mouse strains were maintained at the University of Lausanne (UNIL; Lausanne, Switzerland) SPF Unit. C57BL/6,
CD45.1 congenic (B6.SJL-PtprcaPep3b/BoyJArc), OT-I mice,
and OT-II mice were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (22,
23). Pmel and Trp-1 mice were obtained from The Jackson
Laboratory (24, 25). Foxp3-eGFP reporter mice were purchased
from EMMA (EM:01945; ref. 26). Foxp3-eGFP mice were
crossed to TCR-transgenics to create OT-IIxFoxp3-eGFP
(referred to as OT-II) and Trp-1xFoxp3-eGFP (referred to as
Trp-1). Age- and sex-matched mice between 6 and 14 weeks of
age were used for all experiments. This study was approved by
the local Veterinary Authority and performed in accordance
with Swiss ethical guidelines.
Cell lines
The B16.OVA melanoma cell line was obtained from B.
Huard (University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland;
ref. 27). The B16 and EG7 lymphoma cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-6475 and
CRL-2113; refs. 28, 29). Tumor cell lines were maintained in
complete Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) medium supplemented with G418, at 1 mg/mL for B16.OVA and 0.4
mg/mL for EG7.OVA.
Adoptive cell transfers
Antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ and CD4þ T cells (CD45.2) were
isolated from spleens of TCR-transgenic mice. The frequency
of transgenic T cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry. OT-I
and OT-II cells were labeled with Va2 and Vb5.1/5.2 antibodies, Trp-1 cells with CD4 and Vb14 antibodies, and Pmel cells
with H-2Db/hgp10025-33 tetramers. Na€ve CD45.1 recipient

mice received 1  105 or 1  106 OT-I cells and 3  106 or
1  106 OT-II cells in 200 mL of Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (DMEM) intravenously, as indicated. Alternatively,
mice received 1  105 Pmel and 1  105 Trp-1 cells in 200 mL of
DMEM intravenously.
Immunizations
Mice were immunized with 10 mg OVA257-264 and 10 mg
OVA323-339 peptides or with 10 mg hgp10025-33 and 10 mg Trp1106-130 peptides in 100 mL PBS subcutaneously at the base of
the tail. Peptides were injected alone or in combination with
the following adjuvants: 50 mg CpG-ODN 1826 (CpG),
Pam3CSK4 (Pam3Cys), HMW Poly(I:C), imiquimod, and Quil
A or 5 mg LPS and Flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium, all 
emulsiﬁcation in 50 mL IFA (30, 31). Peptides were manufactured by the Protein and Peptide Chemistry Facility (PPCF) of
the UNIL. Adjuvants were sourced from InvivoGen except CpGODN (Coley Pharmaceuticals) and the Quil A saponin mix from
Quillaja saponaria (generously provided by Brenntag Nordic
A/S). IFA was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, Inc.
Flow cytometry
Draining lymph nodes (inguinal) and spleens were harvested
on day 7 after immunization. Cell suspensions were incubated
with appropriate concentrations of antibody in PBS containing
2% FBS. The anti-FcgRII monoclonal antibody 2.4G2 was used
to inhibit nonspeciﬁc antibody binding. Antibodies were
obtained from BD Pharmingen and eBioscience or grown
in-house from B-cell hybridomas. Samples were acquired using
LSR-II and FACSCanto ﬂow cytometers (Becton-Dickinson)
and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). Lymphocytes
were gated on the basis of forward scatter and side scatter
properties and LIVE/DEAD Aqua Cell Stain (Life Technologies)
was used to exclude dead cells.
In vitro restimulation and intracellular cytokine staining
Cell suspensions were incubated in complete DMEM containing 1 mmol/L of speciﬁc MHC-I and MHC-II peptides for 4
hours in the presence of CD107a-speciﬁc antibodies. Of note, 1
mmol/L Golgiplug and Golgistop were added after 1 hour of
incubation. Cells were harvested, surface labeled, ﬁxed, and
permeabilized using the Fix/Perm Kit. Intracellular cytokines
were detected using anti-IFN-g and anti-interleukin (IL)-2
antibodies. All reagents were purchased from BD Biosciences
and ﬁxation and staining was performed according to the
manufacturer's speciﬁcations.
In vivo cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity was measured using the VITAL assay (32).
Brieﬂy, C57BL/6 splenocytes were left untreated and labeled
with 10 mmol/L CellTracker Orange (CTO; Molecular Probes),
or incubated for 2 hours with 10 or 100 nmol/L OVA or hgp100
peptide, and then labeled with 0.02 or 0.2 mmol/L carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular
Probes), respectively. Labeled cells were mixed at equal ratios,
and approximately 2  106 cells of each population were
injected intravenously. At 6 or 24 hours after target cell
administration, blood was collected for ﬂow cytometric

tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software. ( , P <
0.05;  , P < 0.01;  , P < 0.001).

Tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocyte analysis
Mice that had received OT-I and OT-II T cells were challenged the next day with 2  105 B16.OVA tumor cells subcutaneously in the left ﬂank. One week later, once tumors were
palpable, mice were immunized as described above. After 7
days, draining lymph nodes (dLN) and tumors were excised
and tumors were weighed and digested in collagenase I and
DNase I (Roche). CD45þ cells were puriﬁed by positive selection using magnetic cell separation (MACS) beads and the
AutoMACS automatic cell separator (Miltenyi Biotech).

Antigen-speciﬁc Teff and Treg responses to peptide
vaccination can be speciﬁcally modulated by adjuvant
choice
To perform an in-depth investigation of the vaccine-mediated regulation of antigen-speciﬁc T-cell populations, mice
were given an adoptive transfer of OT-I and OT-II T cells and
then immunized with OVA257-264 and OVA323-339 peptides 
adjuvants. After 7 days, antigen-speciﬁc Teffs and Tregs were
examined by ﬂow cytometry in inguinal dLNs and spleen. We
initially vaccinated mice with OVA peptide alone, OVAþCpG
IFA to determine whether this system could faithfully reproduce the effect observed in the blood of patients with melanoma vaccinated with MelanAþCpGþIFA (21). This was
indeed the case, with CpG IFA signiﬁcantly increasing the
OVA-speciﬁc Teff:Treg ratio in vaccine-dLNs and spleen (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). Polyclonal T cells did not
undergo the same regulation in response to adjuvanted vaccines, as evidenced by stable Teff:Treg ratios (Supplementary
Fig. S1C).
We next set out to determine whether the antigen-speciﬁc
Teff:Treg ratios were similarly regulated by other adjuvants.
Antigen-speciﬁc T cells were identiﬁed using the gating strategy shown in Fig. 1A. We observed that antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cells uniformly upregulated the activation marker CD44
(Supplementary Fig. S2A) in response to all vaccine formulations. However, there was substantial variation in the absolute
numbers of OT-I T cells following immunization, with
OVAþCpG and OVAþPoly(I:C) inducing signiﬁcantly greater
expansion than other vaccine formulations (Fig. 1B). Antigenspeciﬁc CD4þ Teffs decreased expression of the resting marker
CD62L (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and expanded to a similar
extent in response to all adjuvants except imiquimod and Quil
A (Fig. 1C). Absolute OT-II Tregs generally increased following
vaccination regardless of the adjuvant (Fig. 1D). All adjuvants,
with the notable exception of Quil A, reduced the proportion of
Tregs among OT-II cells (Fig. 1E). Ratios of OVA-speciﬁc Teffs
to Tregs were calculated from absolute Teff and Treg counts.
OVAþCpG and OVAþPoly(I:C) signiﬁcantly enhanced antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ Teff:Treg ratios compared with mice vaccinated with OVA alone (Fig. 1F). CpG, Pam3Cys, and Flagellin
enhanced antigen-speciﬁc CD4þ Teff:Treg ratios (Fig. 1G). IFA
increased the immune response to some of the peptideþadjuvant vaccines but did not signiﬁcantly impact antigen-speciﬁc Teff:Treg ratios (Supplementary Fig. S3). CpG,
Poly(I:C), imiquimod, and Quil A (from which QS21 is derived)
were selected for further analysis in in vivo models of tumor
protection due to their contrasting immunologic effects and
particular clinical relevance for cancer vaccination.

Tumor protection
Prophylactic setting. Mice received OT-I and OT-II T cells
intravenously and were immunized the next day with the
indicated OVA vaccine formulations. A total of 2  105 B16.
OVA melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously in the left
ﬂank 1 week later, tumor growth was monitored every 2 to 3
days as described previously (33). Ten days after tumor challenge, mice received a vaccine boost proximal to the tumor.
Therapeutic setting. Mice received OT-I and OT-II T cells
intravenously and were challenged the next day with 5  106
EG7.OVA tumor cells subcutaneously in the left ﬂank, and
examined every 2 to 3 days to monitor tumor growth. Ten days
later, mice with well-established tumors were immunized as
above.
Self-antigen model. Mice received Pmel and Trp-1 cells
intravenously and were immunized the next day with the
indicated hgp100/Trp-1 vaccine formulations and boosted 1
week later. A total of 1  105 B16.F10 melanoma cells were
injected subcutaneously at the time of boosting.
Cytokine multiplex assay and IFN-b ELISA
C57BL/6 mice were immunized subcutaneously at the base
of the tail with peptides  adjuvants as described above. The
dLNs (inguinal) were harvested 12 or 24 hours later. Total
lymph node cell suspensions were incubated at 37 C in IMDM
supplemented with 5% FBS. Supernatant samples were collected and frozen at 1 hour for analysis of type I IFN and at 1, 6,
and 12 hours for cytokine multiplex analysis. Cytokine production was measured with the mouse IFN-b ELISA Kit and 10plex Luminex panel [granulocyte macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10,
IL-12p40/p70 and TNF-a], using the Luminex 200 System with
xPONENT Software (all from Life Technologies) and Epoch
ELISA plate-reader (BioTek).
Statistical calculations
Statistical differences between groups were calculated using
the ANOVA and Dunnett multiple comparison tests, comparing all groups to the peptide alone group. Differences in
survival were calculated using the log-rank test, comparing
all groups to the untreated control. The two-way ANOVA and
Bonferroni posttests, matched by adjuvant group, were used
for cytokine multiplex analysis. Error bars indicate SEM. All

Adjuvants Modulate Antitumor Teff:Treg Ratios

B16.OVA melanomas. One week following vaccination, mice
were sacriﬁced and tumor size as well as tumor-inﬁltrating
lymphocytes was examined. The degree of OT-I tumor inﬁltration was signiﬁcantly greater in mice immunized with
OVAþCpG and OVAþPoly(I:C) compared with other groups
(Fig. 2A, left) and was inversely related to tumor size (Fig. 2A,
right). OT-II Teffs and Tregs inﬁltrated tumors poorly in all of
the experimental groups (Fig. 2B). Because of low numbers of
inﬁltrating OT-II T cells, ratios of antigen-speciﬁc Teffs:Tregs
could not be reliably calculated at the tumor site. Accumulation of OT-I, OT-II Teffs, and OT-II Tregs in vaccine-dLNs of
tumor-bearing mice resembled that of tumor-free mice (Supplementary Fig. S4). Lymph node Teff:Treg ratios correlated
with the degree of antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration and
early tumor control (Fig. 2C vs. Fig. 2A). To investigate longlasting tumor protection, mice were immunized 1 week before
tumor challenge, followed by a booster immunization 10 days
after, and tumor growth was monitored over time. Mice
vaccinated with OVAþCpG were completely protected against
tumor development, and mice vaccinated with OVAþPoly(I:C)
developed tumors much more slowly than controls, leading to
a signiﬁcant improvement in survival time. Tumors developed
and grew rapidly in all mice immunized with OVAþImiquimod
or OVAþQuil A (Fig. 2D). Cytotoxic function of OT-I cells was
tested in vivo 1 week after vaccination in the absence of tumors.
The highest killing of speciﬁc targets was seen in the
OVAþCpG and Poly(I:C) groups, supporting the role of antigen-speciﬁc CTL in mediating tumor protection when present
at high ratios relative to antigen-speciﬁc Tregs (Fig. 2E).
Therapeutic vaccination with OVAþCpG or OVAþ
Poly(I:C) induces the rejection of established tumors
We next wanted to determine whether high Teff:Treg–
inducing vaccines could induce the rejection of established
tumors in a therapeutic setting. Mice with well-established 10day EG7 tumors were vaccinated with OVA peptides  adjuvant. Tumor growth was substantially delayed in the
OVAþCpG and OVAþPoly(I:C) vaccinated groups compared
with controls. Three and 2 of 5 mice in these respective groups
completely rejected their tumors (Fig. 3A and B). The overall
survival of these two groups of mice was consequently
enhanced (Fig. 3B, right), with a signiﬁcant proportion of the
mice remaining tumor-free for at least 50 days. On the other
hand, the tumor growth rate in the OVA alone, OVAþQuil A,
and OVAþImiquimod groups was similar to that of the
untreated controls (Fig. 3A).
Poly(I:C) and CpG enhance the tumor/self-antigen–
speciﬁc Teff:Treg balance
To ascertain whether the adjuvant effects on Teff:Treg ratios
were translatable to a self-/tumor-antigen system, we repeated
our experiments in a gp100 and Trp-1 melanoma antigen
model. We transferred CD8þ Pmel and CD4þ Trp-1 T cells
into CD45.1þ recipient mice and vaccinated them with hgp100
and Trp-1 peptides. A week later antigen-speciﬁc T-cell
responses were measured in dLNs and spleen. Vaccination
with hgp100/Trp-1þPoly(I:C) or CpG induced signiﬁcantly
greater expansion of Pmel T cells than peptide alone (Fig.

www.aacrjournals.org

4A, left). Effector potential was assessed by restimulating
splenocytes with speciﬁc peptides for 4 hours. A substantial
proportion of Pmel Teffs in all adjuvanted vaccination
groups acquired at least one effector characteristic: producing IL-2, IFN-g, or releasing cytotoxic granules via externalization of CD107a (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Polyfunctional
effectors, simultaneously producing IL-2, IFN-g, and degranulating, were most frequent following vaccination with selfpeptidesþPoly(I:C) or CpG (Fig. 4A, right). This corresponded with the greatly enhanced Teff:Treg ratios observed
in the hgp100/Trp-1þPoly(I:C) or CpG groups (Fig. 4D). Trp1 Teff expansion was signiﬁcantly enhanced in response to
immunization with self-peptidesþPoly(I:C), CpG, or Quil A
(Fig. 4B, left). Similar proportions of Trp-1 Teffs in all
vaccinated groups displayed at least one effector function
(Supplementary Fig. S5B), whereas signiﬁcantly higher frequencies of Trp-1 Teffs in the hgp100/Trp-1þPoly(I:C) or
CpG groups simultaneously produced IFN-g and IL-2 (Fig.
4B, right). Self-peptide immunization with Poly(I:C), CpG, or
imiquimod reduced the number of Tregs among Trp-1 T
cells, whereas Quil A increased their number (Fig. 4C). The
ratio of Trp-1 Teffs:Tregs was signiﬁcantly increased for
groups receiving Poly(I:C) and CpG, but not for Quil A or
imiquimod (Fig. 4E). Importantly, the higher antigen-speciﬁc
Teff:Treg ratios observed with hgp100/Trp-1þPoly(I:C) or
CpG immunization resulted in signiﬁcantly greater in vivo
killing of hgp100-pulsed targets (Fig. 4F). Altogether, these
data corroborate the results obtained in the OVA model.
Adjuvants promoting high Teff:Treg ratios confer
protection against tumor growth in a self-/tumorantigen system
We next set out to determine whether the polyfunctional
Teffs generated by vaccination with tumor/self-peptide and
CpG or Poly(I:C) could confer protection against B16 tumor
challenge. Mice received Pmel and Trp-1 T cells and were
immunized with gp100þTrp-1 peptides  adjuvant 1 week
before tumor challenge, followed by a booster immunization
on the day of tumor graft. Mice vaccinated with hgp100/Trp1þCpG or Poly(I:C) developed tumors much more slowly
than controls (Fig. 5A), leading to a signiﬁcant improvement
in survival time (Fig. 5B). Depigmentation was observed in
several groups of vaccinated mice and was most prevalent in
the peptideþCpG and Poly(I:C) groups, correlating with
enhanced survival (Fig. 5C) and conﬁrming that vaccination
with high Teff:Treg–inducing adjuvants in a natural tumorantigen setting induces a functional and protective immune
response.
High Teff:Treg promoting adjuvants induce early
production of type I cytokines
There is abundant evidence that certain TLR ligands
induce maturation of APCs and proinﬂammatory cytokine
production, differentially polarizing T cells during priming.
Thus, dLNs were harvested 12 or 24 hours after immunization and cultured in the absence of further stimulation to
assess the cytokine milieu produced by APC. Signiﬁcant
levels of IFN-b were detected in supernatants from dLNs

for 1 hour (Fig. 6A). Inﬂammatory mediators IL-12, IFN-g,
and IL-6 were detected in 1-, 6-, and 12-hour culture supernatants of dLNs from mice vaccinated with OVAþCpG or
OVAþPoly(I:C) 12 hours earlier (Fig. 6B, left). OVAþQuil A
and OVAþImiquimod induced less or no IL-12, IFN-g, and
IL-6 at the same time points. Lymph nodes extracted from
mice vaccinated with OVAþCpG 24 hours earlier continued
to produce a small but signiﬁcant amount of IL-12 detected
in the culture supernatant, whereas the levels of the other
analytes returned to baseline in all groups (Fig. 6B, right).
Variable levels of TNF-a and IL-2 production were detected
but no signiﬁcant difference was apparent between groups
(Supplementary Fig. S6). No production of GM-CSF, IL-1b,
IL-4, or IL-10 was detected (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of a
panel of adjuvants to better characterize their antigen-speciﬁc
effects on antitumor immune responses following peptide

vaccination. Our dual T-cell adoptive transfer models were
ideal tools to closely examine the relationship between vaccine-induced antigen-speciﬁc Teff and Treg populations,
which are extremely rare in a physiologic setting. We were
able to determine a hierarchy among the different adjuvants
tested with regards to their ability to modulate antigen-speciﬁc
Teff and Treg responses. Similar results were obtained in the
ovalbumin and melanoma peptide models, highlighting the
robustness of this experimental system. It is also noteworthy
that our results in both mouse models tested recapitulated our
observations in patients with melanoma vaccinated with
Melan-A peptide and CpG-ODN (21).
We found that immunization with peptide and adjuvants
CpG-ODN and Poly(I:C) preferentially promoted the expansion
of antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ and CD4þ Teffs over that of antigenspeciﬁc Tregs, resulting in increased Teff:Treg ratios. In addition, these adjuvants endowed antigen-speciﬁc effector cells
with polyfunctional effector capacity. In contrast, we found
that Quil A and imiquimod maintained or even decreased Teff:
Treg ratios due to a greater accumulation of antigen-speciﬁc

polyfunctionality were reduced. Polyfunctionality is a deﬁning
feature of long-lived T cells, and correlates with increased
disease protection in both human antiviral vaccination and
murine tumor immunotherapy studies (34–36). Furthermore, a
recent report demonstrated that human papillomavirus E7
peptideþCpG-ODN or Poly(I:C) vaccine formulations expanded multi-cytokine–producing CD8þ effector memory T cells,
the presence of which predicted therapeutic efﬁcacy against
cancer in mice (37). Our results are consistent with these
studies and provide the additional dimension of control of
antigen-speciﬁc Treg expansion by CpG-ODN or Poly(I:C)
adjuvants.

Previous studies have linked total CD8þ T cell:CD4þ Treg
ratios to both natural tumor progression (5, 38) and cancer
immunotherapy outcomes in mice and humans (39, 40). However, little information exists on the role of antigen-speciﬁc
Tregs on disease outcome, or how this population might be
regulated by immunotherapy. Data are emerging on the
Teff and antigen-speciﬁc Treg relationships in autoimmunity
and transplantation. Immunotherapies that enhance antigenspeciﬁc Treg expansion and suppressive function delayed
multi-cytokine–producing Teff activation, resulting in disease
control (41, 42). To date, the relationship between antigenspeciﬁc Teffs and Tregs has not been examined in detail in
cancer, although some in vitro and observational reports exist

Adjuvants Modulate Antitumor Teff:Treg Ratios

Figure 5. Vaccination with tumor/self-peptides and Poly(I:C) or CpG confers protection against tumor challenge. Mice received Pmel and Trp-1 T cells
intravenously as in Fig. 4 and were vaccinated 1 day later with hgp10025-33 and Trp-1106-130 peptides  adjuvant. Seven days later, mice were
challenged with B16 tumor cells subcutaneously and at the same time received a second vaccine dose. Tumor growth and survival were monitored over
time. A, growth curves of B16 tumors are shown for individual mice in the different groups. B, survival following tumor challenge. C, vaccine-induced

(19–21). Our study extends the knowledge base gained from
previous investigations by comparing a large panel of adjuvants for their ability to modulate the vaccine-speciﬁc Teff:
Treg balance. Our results indicate that each adjuvant uniquely
modulates antigen-speciﬁc Teff:Treg ratios, which in turn
correlate with tumor control. Interestingly, we found that in
contrast to antigen-speciﬁc responses, polyclonal Teff:Treg
ratios are not affected by vaccination with speciﬁc peptide in
adjuvant (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Thus, the behavior of
polyclonal T-cell populations cannot be used to predict the
responses of antigen-speciﬁc cells. This fact should be considered in rational vaccine design, which should focus on controlling the balance of Teffs versus Tregs with deﬁned antigen
speciﬁcities to create the most effective vaccines.
We found that the ratios of antigen-speciﬁc Teffs:Tregs in
tumor-dLNs were similar to those observed in vaccine-dLNs of
tumor-free mice. High Teff:Treg ratios induced by CpG-ODN
and Poly(I:C) in the lymphoid tissues correlated with increased

www.aacrjournals.org

OT-I T-cell activation, cytotoxic activity, and tumor inﬁltration, leading to signiﬁcantly higher protection against tumor
growth. Surprisingly, antigen-speciﬁc Tregs inﬁltrated melanomas very poorly and are therefore unlikely to play a major
role at the tumor site. This is in sharp contrast to the profound
inﬁltration of polyclonal Tregs into many tumors, including
melanomas, which has been observed by us (data not shown)
and others (43, 44). That antigen-speciﬁc T cells should play an
important role in the lymph nodes rather than at the disease
site is consistent with reports that antigen-engagement by
Tregs is important for initial priming, allowing ﬁne-regulation
of the priming of effector cells of the same speciﬁcity (45). Once
activated, Tregs can suppress nonspeciﬁcally, thus eliminating
the need for antigen-speciﬁc Tregs at disease sites (45, 46).
These ﬁndings outline the relevance of antigen-speciﬁc Teff:
Treg ratios in the development of antitumor immunity. Measuring this balance in the periphery may consequently provide
a more accurate method of predicting vaccine efﬁcacy (39, 47).

modifying their T cell priming potential (51). Type I IFNs are
necessary for the maturation of dendritic cells and the generation of CTL and Th1 responses. Vaccines containing Poly(I:C),
CpG or the TLR-7/8 ligand R-848 have been shown to induce
IFN-a/b-dependent production of type I cytokines (48, 49).
Dendritic cells are also matured by stimulation with the TLR
ligands LPS and CpG. They upregulate MHC-II, CD80 and CD86
expression and produce the inﬂammatory cytokines IL-12,
IFN-g and IL-6, which promote effector CTL and Th1 development as well as directly inhibiting Tregs (50, 52, 53). We
found that a dendritic cell maturing/type I polarizing cytokine
milieu consisting of IFN-b, IL-12, IFN-g and IL-6 was induced in
dLNs early after vaccination with peptideþCpG or Poly(I:C).
These adjuvants induced the highest antigen-speciﬁc Teff:Treg
ratios and the best antitumor outcomes, providing clues about
the mechanism behind the adjuvant effects on vaccine-speciﬁc
T cell balance. Antibody-blockade of type I IFNs, and/or IL-12,
or experiments in KO mouse strains would be necessary to
produce deﬁnitive evidence for the role of these cytokines, but
the concordance of our results with the large body of existing
data provide strong support for this preliminary mechanistic
explanation.
In conclusion, we have shown that not all adjuvants are
equal in their ability to modulate vaccine-speciﬁc immune
responses. Our data support the use of the adjuvants CpGODN and Poly(I:C) in peptide vaccines containing both CD4
and CD8 epitopes, to enhance the activation of polyfunctional Teffs and avoid Treg expansion. This study also
highlights the importance of studying antigen-speciﬁc Teff
and Treg responses in the context of peptide vaccination, as
these cannot necessarily be extrapolated from an evaluation
of total polyclonal responses. Finally, we reveal a correlation
between the choice of adjuvant in a peptide vaccine formulation, the antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ and CD4þ Teff:Treg ratios,
the size and quality of the resulting Teff response, and the
degree of tumor protection induced. This suggests that
antigen-speciﬁc Teff:Treg ratios are a useful measure of
vaccination outcome and have the potential to be a valuable
predictive biomarker of objective clinical responses in cancer immunotherapy.

dLNs were collected 12 or 24 hours later and homogenized and
incubated at 37 C. Supernatants were collected from the lymph node
cultures after 1, 6, and 12 hours and analyzed by ELISA and Luminex. A,
IFN-b production measured by ELISA 1 hour after lymph node extraction.
B, cytokine production measured by Luminex after lymph node extraction

three samples per group in one of three independent experiments. Dotted
lines show the detection limit.

The mechanisms involved in the control of effector versus
Treg induction, whether polyclonal or antigen-speciﬁc, are not
completely understood. However, the maturation state of APCs
and the resulting proinﬂammatory cytokine environment at
the site of T-cell priming is known to be important (48–50).
There is ample evidence that vaccine adjuvants, and TLR
agonists in particular, can mature dendritic cells, inducing
expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD40 and
