ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND:
Autophagy is an important oncotarget that can be modulated during anti-cancer
therapy. Enhancing autophagy using chemotherapy and rapamycin (Rapa) treatment
and then inhibiting it using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could synergistically improve
therapy outcome in cancer patients. It is still unclear whether addition of Rapa and
HCQ to chemotherapy could be used for reversing drug resistance.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:
Twenty-five stage IV cancer patients were identified. They had no clinical
response to first-line metronomic chemotherapy; the patients were salvaged by
adding an autophagy inducer (Rapa, 2 mg/day) and an autophagosome inhibitor
(HCQ, 400 mg/day) to their current metronomic chemotherapy for at least 3 months.
Patients included 4 prostate, 4 bladder, 4 lung, 4 breast, 2 colon, and 3 head and neck
cancer patients as well as 4 sarcoma patients.
RESULTS:
Chemotherapy was administered for a total of 137 months. The median duration
of chemotherapy cycles per patient was 4 months (95% confidence interval, 3–7
months). The overall response rate to this treatment was of 40%, with an 84%
disease control rate. The most frequent and clinically significant toxicities were
myelotoxicities. Grade ≥3 leucopenia occurred in 6 patients (24%), grade ≥3
thrombocytopenia in 8 (32%), and anemia in 3 (12%). None of them developed
febrile neutropenia. Non-hematologic toxicities were fatigue (total 32%, with 1
patient developing grade 3 fatigue), diarrhea (total 20%, 1 patient developed grade
3 fatigue), reversible grade 3 cardiotoxicity (1 patient), and grade V liver toxicity
from hepatitis B reactivation (1 patient).
CONCLUSION:
Our results of Rapa, HCQ and chemotherapy triplet combination suggest
autophagy is a promising oncotarget and warrants further investigation in phase II
studies.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Periodical delivery of standard recommended
chemotherapy doses in some types of cancers is often
associated with significant toxicity without therapeutic
gain. The frequent administration of low doses (1/10th to
1/3rd of maximum tolerated dose, MTD) of certain antineoplastic drugs, known as metronomic chemotherapy, has
demonstrated its efficacy and is now getting more popular
[1]. The anti-cancer effect occurred principally via an antiangiogenic/anti-vascular mechanism [1, 2]. Several in vivo
experiments have shown that metronomic chemotherapy
is more effective in combination with anti-angiogenic,
immunotherapeutic, or targeted therapeutic agents [3, 4].
A growing number of clinical studies have adopted the
concept of combined metronomic chemotherapy with
anti-angiogenic therapy and have reported an increase
in progression-free survival (PFS) in cases of recurrent
glioblastoma multiforme [5], cisplatin-refractory ovarian
cancer [6], advanced breast cancer [7, 8], non-small cell
lung cancer [9], hepatoma [10], and colon cancer [11].
Autophagy is known to promote cancer growth
and survival under conditions of nutrient deprivation,
hypoxia, or DNA damage caused by chemotherapy [12].
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)—a clinically approved antirheumatoid drug—is an analogue of chloroquine (CQ)
and acts as a lysosomotropic agent; HCQ inactivates
lysosomal enzymes by increasing intralysosomal pH and
significantly inhibiting the last process of autophagy [12].
A greater inhibition of the proliferative activity of various
types of cancer has been reported when chemotherapy
was combined with the inhibition of autophagy [13].
The premise of inhibiting autophagy to overcome
chemotherapy resistance has been clinically investigated
[14-19]. Rapa, a clinically approved anti-rejection
drug, also known as mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitor, can induce cellular autophagy [20].
Autophagy modulation by combined treatment with an
mTOR inhibitor (Rapa) and a lysosome inhibitor (HCQ)
was shown to be effective in models of breast cancer,
melanoma, and glioma [21-24]. We have found the
triplet combination of HCQ, Rapa, and chemotherapy
to be synergistic by pushing autophagy through Rapa
+ chemotherapy and then blocking the final autophagy
process through HCQ [25].
A Rapa analogue, everolimus, in combination
with HCQ, was found to inhibit growth of endothelial
progenitor cells [26]. In this retrospective report, by
collecting anecdotal cases in our institute, we found that
addition of Rapa and HCQ to a metronomic chemotherapy
therapy regimen might be an attractive way to increase
sensitization to both the anti-cancer and the antiangiogenesis effect of chemotherapy.

Patient characteristics
A total of 46 patients received metronomic
chemotherapy from May 2012 to September 2014, and
25 of them fitting the study criteria were included in the
analysis (17 women and 8 men). The median age was 62
years (range 47-76). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status was 0 in 10 patients and 1 in 15
patients. The characteristics of the patient population are
summarized in Table 1.

Tumor responses
Within the group of 25 evaluable patients, 10
(40%) experienced PR, and 11 (44%) had SD. Eightyfour percent of patients experienced clinical benefits
for more than 3 months. The clinical characteristics and
results of patients who received this treatment strategy
are summarized in Table 2. Representative images and
tumor marker changes before metronomic chemotherapy,
and before and after salvage metronomic chemotherapy
are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Many patients documented
in the study had non-measurable lesions but had a drop
in tumor markers >50%. The median follow-up time was
11 months (range, 3–28 months). The median duration of
salvage treatment was 4 months (95% confidence interval,
3–7 months) before disease progression, contented stop,
or refusal to continue treatment. It was very difficult to
evaluate the effect of adding Rapa + HCQ to metronomic
chemotherapy on the PFS in such a heterogeneous group
of patients. Nevertheless, the state of 2 patients progressed
from PD to PR and that of another 8 patients progressed
from SD to PR, following Rapa + HCQ salvage treatment,
suggesting an encouraging response to this treatment.

Toxicities
Data related to non-hematologic toxicity indicated
that therapy was well tolerated. As shown in Table 3,
8 patients (32%) reported grade ≥1 fatigue, including
1 who had grade 3 fatigue and had to discontinue the
treatment; diarrhea followed as the second most common
toxicity, with 4 (16%) patients exhibiting grade 2 and 1
(4%) reporting grade 3 diarrhea. Two (8%) patients had
mucositis and 1 (4%) reported grade 3 nausea/vomiting
or renal toxicity. One patient (patient # 23) had grade
3 cardiotoxicity, with a left ventricle ejection fraction
of 35%. The patient recovered after discontinuing all
treatment. She had no history of doxorubicin usage.
One patient (patient # 22) experienced grade V hepatitis,
which was attributed to the reactivation of previously

unnoted hepatitis B virus. She had not been administered
prophylactic anti-viral medicine. Myelotoxicity was
relatively common, with 8 patients (32%) developing
grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia, 6 patients (24%) developing
grade ≥ 3 leucopenia and 3 patients (12%) having grade
≥ 3 anemia. None of the patients developed febrile
neutropenia, and they all recovered quickly from
myelotoxicities after one to two weeks of treatment
interruption.

DISCUSSION
This is the first report on the addition of Rapa and
HCQ to conventional metronomic chemotherapy, which
was found to be safe and well tolerated in a variety of
cancer types. Most importantly, this chemotherapeutic
combination was associated with a 40% observed
response rate and an 84% disease stabilization in a cohort
of patients refractory to their chemotherapy regimen. The
significant clinical benefit observed in patients resistant
to chemotherapy was unexpected and merits further
investigation.
A growing number of clinical studies have shown
that the anticancer effect of metronomic chemotherapy is
primarily a consequence of its anti-angiogenic effect. Lowdose chemotherapy is preferentially cytotoxic to dividing
endothelial cells [30], leading to death of circulating
endothelial progenitor cells [31] and a decreased
microvessel density [32]. Rapa, although traditionally
thought of as an immunosuppressive drug, may also inhibit

tumor growth and have anti-angiogenic effects [33].
Recently, CQ has also been reported not only to reduce
tumor growth, but also to improve tumor angiogenesis
in a mechanism independent of autophagy [34]. CQ
normalized tumor vessel structure and perfusion function,
improved hypoxia, and reduced tumor invasion through
endosomal Notch 1 trafficking and signaling in endothelial
cells [34]. The synergistic effect of everolimus and CQ
combination on endothelial cell apoptosis was found to be
linked to the down-regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
in these cells [26]. Clearly, the combination of metronomic
chemotherapy, Rapa and HCQ must activate common antiangiogenic pathways. The CT attenuation of Hounsfield
Units in bladder cancer with liver metastases as shown in
Figure 1 is typical evidence of anti-angiogenic effects after
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination treatment [35].
It is not yet known whether the positive results
obtained using this strategy is caused solely by additive
anti-angiogenic effects or by modulation of autophagy.
Several phase II clinical trials have examined the
potential benefits of adding either mTOR inhibitors (Rapa,
everolimus, tenolimus) or HCQ (autophagy-lysosome
inhibitor) to conventional chemotherapy in the treatment
of patients with malignant gliomas [36, 37], non–Hodgkin
lymphomas [38], sarcoma [39], melanoma [15, 16],
breast [40], non–small cell lung [41, 42], esophageal
[43], and head and neck cancers [44]. Neither strategy
had resulted in impressive results. This is the first clinical
report describing concomitant use of Rapa, HCQ, and
chemotherapy in various cancer types. The results of this

self-controlled study indicated that such combinations
were not only effective, but also could reverse drug
resistance. The autophagy inducer and lysosomal
inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy seem to work
synergistically. The doses of Rapa (2 mg/day) and HCQ
(400 mg/day) were derived from conventional therapeutic
doses used in rheumatoid arthritis, kidney transplantation,
or treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis [45-47].
These doses are not MTD, especially for HCQ, which was
reportedly used at a dose of 1200 mg/day in combination
with temozolomide for the treatment of solid tumors [8].
The dosages of these drugs were not obtained through
serial phase I studies of different chemotherapeutic
combinations, and therefore, the doses of these drugs
could be increased further prior to committing to a phase
II trial. Another weakness of this report is the lack of
pharmacodynamic assays in tumor tissues or peripheral
mononuclear cells. Indeed, the targeted signaling pathways
(autophagy or angiogenesis) might not have been modified
by these drugs. We have conducted a molecular imaging
study in sarcoma patients before and after 2 weeks of
treatment with Rapa (2 mg/day) and HCQ (400 mg/day)
on the basis of reports that cancer-associated fibroblasts
could be potential oncotargets [48].
Although a clinical benefit rate of 84% in this
selectively chosen patient cohort seems impressive,
additional randomized phase II trials are required before
the claim of actual clinical benefits can be accepted.
Nevertheless, the real benefit of dual modulation of
autophagy might be even more impressive in combination
with standard dose chemotherapy.

Patients were treated using different metronomic
regimen based on their disease type: cyproterone, 50 mg
orally 1 tablet twice daily (1# bid), and, docetaxel, 40 mg
per body intravenously (i.v.) every 2 weeks (q2w) for
prostate cancer; capecitabine, 500 mg 1# bid, vinorelbine,
30 mg orally once a week (qw), and gemcitabine, 800 mg/
m2 i.v. q2w for breast cancer; vinorelbine, 30 mg orally
qw plus docetaxel, 40 mg per body i.v. q2w for lung
cancer; capecitabine, 500 mg 1# bid, and irinotecan, 100
mg/m2 i.v. q2w for colorectal cancer; carboplatin, 150
mg per body, plus gemcitabine, 1400 mg per body i.v.
q2w for bladder cancer; cyclophosphamide, 50 mg orally
every other day (qod), methotrexate, 50 mg orally qw,
tegafur and uracil (UFT), 1# three times a day (tid), and
cisplatin, 30 mg/m2 i.v. q2w for head and neck cancers;
cyclophosphamide, 50 mg orally qod, etoposide, 50 mg
orally qod, and gemcitabine, 1400 mg per body i.v. q2w
for sarcoma. Rapa (2 mg) and HCQ (400 mg) treatments
were started following the physician’s suggestion the
patients’ signing an agreement for the additional treatment.
The dose of Rapa, HCQ was choosing from conventional
therapeutic doses used in rheumatoid arthritis, kidney
transplantation. The metronomic chemotherapy schedule
was followed as given above. There was no dose
modification of Rapa, HCQ, or chemotherapy. The only
treatment interruption was scheduled when grade ≥ 3
myelotoxicity was observed, with a maximum delay of
3 weeks being allowed. Supportive care agents such as
anti-emetics, antibiotics, loperamide, growth factors,
transfusions, or fluid supply were administered as
indicated.
Treatment was discontinued with the development
of grade IV non-myelotoxicity, patient intolerance, or
disease progression. Treatment-related toxicity was
assessed every 2 weeks. Toxicity was scored according
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE) v4.0 [27]. Response was evaluated using chest
radiography, computed tomography (CT), or positron
emission tomography-computed tomography, which were
obtained in principle every 2 to 3 months. Tumor markers
were assessed every 1 to 3 months. Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) v1.1 guidelines were
used as follows: complete response (CR, disappearance of
measurable disease without development of new lesions,
with tumor markers dropping to normal range), partial
response (PR, at least 30% reduction in the sum of the
longest diameters measured at disease sites or enhanced
area), progressive disease (PD, at least 20% increase in
the sum of the longest diameter measured disease sites
or appearance of new lesions), and stable disease (SD,
if determination did not meet criteria of CR, PR, or PD,
or those patients with tumor markers decline of > 50%
in non-measurable lesions) [28, 29]. The radiologic
evaluation of the response was obtained by consensus

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection
Patients chosen for analysis were required to have
incurable metastatic/recurrent disease and no clinical
response from current metronomic chemotherapy
regardless of the primary tumor type. Patients needed to
continue the same metronomic chemotherapy in addition
to Rapa (2 mg qd) and HCQ (400 mg qd) as salvage
treatment. They needed to have an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1; a life
expectancy of at least 3 months before salvage treatment,
and either have at least one single site of measurable (twodimensional) disease or serial and continuous (>3 monthly
measurement) elevated tumor markers (at least twice the
upper limit) in patients with non-measurable lesions.
Patients were excluded if treatment with metronomic
therapy and salvage therapy was shorter than 12 weeks,
unless there was a radiographic confirmation of disease
progression. This retrospective study was approved by our
institutional review board (IRB).
