BACKGROUND: High-dose thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide (TBC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been
used in patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Despite limited penetration into the CNS,
rituximab is active in primary CNS NHL. Therefore, high-dose rituximab was combined with TBC for ASCT in patients with CNS NHL. METHODS: A single-arm phase 2 trial using high-dose rituximab with cytarabine for stem cell mobilization followed by high-dose rituximab
combined with thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide (R-TBC) for ASCT was conducted. Doses of rituximab at 1000 mg/m2 were
given on days 1 and 8 of mobilization and on days 29 and 22 of TBC. The primary endpoint was efficacy. RESULTS: Thirty patients
were enrolled. Eighteen patients had primary CNS NHL (12 with complete remission (CR)/first partial remission (PR1) and 6 with CR/PR2),
and 12 patients had secondary CNS lymphoma (5 with CR/PR1 and 7 with CR/PR2 or beyond). All patients were in partial or complete remission. Twenty-nine patients proceeded to R-TBC ASCT. Two patients developed significant neurotoxicity. The 100-day nonrelapse mortality
rate was 0%, and 1 patient died because of nonrelapse causes 5 months after ASCT. For all patients, at a median follow-up of 24 months
(range, 12-40 months), the estimated 2-year progression-free survival rate was 81% (95% confidence interval, 59%-92%), and the 2-year overall survival rate was 93% (95% confidence interval, 76%-98%). There were no relapses or deaths among the 18 patients with primary CNS lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with CNS involvement by B-cell NHL and especially for patients with primary CNS NHL, R-TBC

INTRODUCTION
Historically, the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has carried a poor
prognosis. In patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), modern regimens including chemotherapy
agents with high levels of CNS penetration (typically using a backbone of systemic high-dose methotrexate [MTX]) and
combined modality therapy have significantly improved the previously poor response rates and prognosis.1-5 Despite this
success, relapse rates have remained high, with only 20% to 30% of patients achieving a durable long-term remission after
high-dose MTX therapy. The inclusion of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has improved short-term outcomes, but it has
also been associated with significant rates of neurotoxicity, particularly in patients older than 60 years.2,5,6 Recently,

High-Dose R-TBC ASCT in CNS NHL/Chen et al

investigators have added consolidation chemotherapy using
other agents such as cytarabine and etoposide7 or have used
reduced-dose WBRT8 with promising results.
Secondary central nervous system lymphoma
(SCNSL), defined as either synchronous CNS involvement in a patient with systemic NHL or as a site of recurrence in a patient with a history of systemic NHL, is also a
difficult therapeutic problem. Historically, the mainstay of
therapy for secondary CNS NHL has been systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy and/or WBRT. In several large series, SCNSL patients have had a median survival on the
order of 2.5 to 4 months with 1-year survival rates of only
approximately 25%.9-11 In the largest international case
series of 113 patients with exclusively brain parenchyma
relapses, systemic chemotherapy, particularly with regimens containing high-dose MTX, emerged as the only
treatment modality suggesting improved overall survival
(OS), although relapses occurred in 68% of the patients
with a median time to progression of 1 year, and only
10% of the patients attained a durable remission.12
Because of these poor outcomes with conventional
chemotherapy for PCNSL and SCNSL, intensification of
the treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous
stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been explored for
PCNSL and SCNSL.13-24 One high-dose chemotherapy
regimen that has been used for patients with CNS lymphoma is a combination of thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide (TBC), which was first reported by
investigators in France.22,23 Pharmacokinetic studies have
shown all 3 agents to have significant penetration of the
blood-brain barrier, with thiotepa and busulfan achieving
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels greater than 80% of plasma
concentrations.22,23,25-30 We have previously reported our
institutions’ experience with TBC ASCT for this population
and showed compelling safety and efficacy.31 The addition
of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has
become the standard of care for CD20-expressing systemic
NHL and also PCNSL.32,33 Despite a high molecular
weight of 145 kD, rituximab appears to be able to penetrate
CSF in small amounts in comparison with systemic levels.
Given this limited penetration but compelling single-agent
activity observed in PCNSL, we explored whether adding
several high doses of rituximab during high-dose cytarabine
stem cell mobilization and TBC ASCT could increase levels
of rituximab in the CNS and improve disease control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This study was approved by the institutional review board
at the Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center and was conCancer

ducted at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center and the Massachusetts General Hospital
Cancer Center. Informed consent was obtained from all
subjects. All patients met institutional standard criteria for
ASCT, including an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 or 1, a total bilirubin
level < 2.0 mg/dL, a creatinine level < 2.0 mg/dL, a diffusing capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide corrected
for hemoglobin > 50% of the predicted value corrected
for hemoglobin, and a cardiac left ventricular ejection
fraction > 45%. The CNS disease status at the time of
ASCT was identified with magnetic resonance imaging
and/or CSF analysis (if applicable) as first or subsequent
remission and either partial or complete response. A complete response was defined as no evidence of contrastenhancing tumor on imaging and a negative CSF analysis
(when available), with assessments defined with modifications to the standard Macdonald criteria.34
Regimen
Mobilization

For autologous stem cell mobilization, patients received
cytarabine at 3000 mg/m2 intravenously every 12 hours
on days 1 and 2 (4 doses) along with rituximab at
1000 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8. The actual
body weight (ABW) was used for rituximab dose calculations. For patients  60 years of age, the cytarabine dose
was reduced to 2000 mg/m2 to avoid cerebellar toxicity
(the lesser value of the ABW or ideal body weight [IBW]).
Subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was
started on day 4 at 10 mg/kg daily (rounded to the nearest
prefilled syringe dose) and was continued until adequate
stem cell collection had been performed. For autologous
stem cell collection, patients underwent large-volume leukapheresis according to standard institutional procedures,
and progenitor cells were then cryopreserved according to
validated institutional methods. A minimum of 2 3 106
CD341 cells/kg was required to be collected before the
patient proceeded to ASCT.
High-dose chemotherapy and ASCT

Within 4 weeks of successful stem cell collection, participants were admitted for rituximab combined with thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide (R-TBC) and
ASCT. Mucositis prophylaxis with palifermin before conditioning and after ASCT was recommended but not
mandated. Beginning on day 29 and through day 27,
each patient was treated with thiotepa (250 mg/m2 intravenously per day, lesser value of ABW or IBW). On days
26 to 24, patients received busulfan (0.8 mg/kg

ABW or IBW with the adjusted IBW used for obese
patients), and on days 23 and 22, cyclophosphamide
(60 mg/kg intravenously per day, lesser value of ABW or
IBW) was given with mesna (15 mg/kg 4 times per day)
for uroprotection. For patients  60 years of age, the
busulfan dose was decreased to 0.6 mg/kg (a 25% dose
reduction). High-dose rituximab at 1000 mg/m2 was
given intravenously on day 29 (after thiotepa was started)
and day 22 (after the completion of cyclophosphamide).
Autologous stem cell infusion was performed on day 0 per
standard institutional practice. Filgrastim (5 mg/kg intravenously or subcutaneously once per day) was started on
day 11 and was continued until neutrophil recovery.
Busulfan-related seizure prophylaxis was given with levetiracetam on days 26 to 23. Patients also received ursodiol (300 mg 3 times per day) and infectious prophylaxis
against herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus and
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Neutrophil engraftment
was defined as the first of 2 consecutive days with an absolute neutrophil count > 500 cells/mm3. Platelet recovery
was defined as the first of 2 consecutive days with an
unsupported platelet count > 20,000/mm3.
Rituximab levels

To assess rituximab penetration into the CNS, rituximab
levels were measured from both serum and CSF via lum228

bar puncture. Serum levels were measured before the first
dose of high-dose rituximab during high-dose cytarabine/
rituximab mobilization therapy and then concurrently
with the CSF level (24-36 hours after the infusion of rituximab was complete). Rituximab measurements were
performed at Covance Bioanalytical Services (Chantilly,
Va).
Statistical Methods

The study was designed to target an alternative 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 50% versus a historical
control rate of 30%. Patient safety was closely monitored
during the trial, with stopping rules for excessive toxicity
or excessive 100-day progression/mortality rates incorporated into the study design. Data were locked on March
13, 2014 with a median follow-up of 24 months for the
26 known survivors. The primary endpoint, the 1-year
PFS rate, was reported as a binary endpoint. OS and PFS
were also reported as time-to-event outcomes. OS was calculated from the date of transplantation to death from
any cause. PFS was calculated from the date of transplantation to the date of disease progression or death from any
cause. Patients who were alive without relapse or progression were censored at the time of last contact. Secondary
endpoints included OS and nonrelapse mortality. OS was
calculated from the date of transplant to death from any
cause. Nonrelapse mortality was defined as any death
without evidence of relapse and was estimated with relapse
or death from relapse as a competing risk.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Thirty patients (17 men and 13 women) with CNS
involvement by B-cell NHL were enrolled in the trial.
Eighteen patients had PCNSL, and 12 had SCNSL. Clinical characteristics for all patients are reported in Table 1.
The median age at the time of enrollment was 58 years
(range, 24-74 years). All cases of PCNSL were diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma according to histology, and they
included 1 case of Epstein-Barr virus–associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease in a recipient of a
prior kidney transplant. In patients with SCNSL, histologies included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n 5 9),
chronic lymphoid leukemia (n 5 2), and follicular lymphoma (n 5 1). In the patients with chronic lymphoid
leukemia and follicular lymphoma, CNS involvement
was found in these original histologies and was not from
disease transformation to a higher grade NHL.
As for the 18 patients with PCNSL, 11 were in 1st
complete remission (CR1), 1 was in 1st partial remission

(PR1), 5 were in 2nd complete remission (CR2), and 1
was in 2nd partial remission (PR2) at the time of enrollment. All patients had been treated at some point during
their course with intravenous high-dose MTX–based therapy (range, 3.5-8 g/m2 per dose), as shown in Table 1.
None of the patients with PCNSL had received WBRT.
One of the 12 patients with SCNSL had refractory disease
and achieved a temporary response after salvage infusional
etoposide/high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy but then
progressed rapidly after high-dose cytarabine mobilization
chemotherapy and did not undergo R-TBC ASCT during
the study. Five of the other 11 patients with SCNSL were
in CR1, and 6 were in CR2 or beyond at the time of enrollment. Nine of the 11 patients had been treated with highdose intravenous MTX-based therapy, and 2 had been
treated with WBRT, whereas 7 patients had received localized radiation therapy for involved non-CNS fields. All 30
patients had been previously treated with standard-dose
(375 mg/m2/dose) intravenous rituximab as part of their
induction or salvage treatments.
Treatment-Related Toxicity

No significant toxicities were observed with high-dose rituximab-cytarabine mobilization chemotherapy except for
expected neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. All patients
tolerated infusions of high-dose rituximab without complications. All patients developed expected grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia during inpatient
hospitalization for R-TBC ASCT. The most common
toxicities observed during the ASCT hospitalization were

diarrhea and mucositis, as previously described with
TBC.31,35 In terms of infectious complications, there were
9 documented bacterial infections, all of which were treated
with complete resolution. One patient developed highgrade candidemia and also experienced cytomegalovirus
reactivation necessitating treatment. Two patients developed significant neurotoxicity. The first was a patient with
SCNSL who had previously been treated with WBRT and
subsequently with high-dose MTX. He had cognitive
impairment before trial entry; during the ASCT hospitalization, he developed delirium and continued to have cognitive decline and repeated aspiration episodes. He died of
complications related to his cognitive decline 5 months after ASCT. The other patient developed thrombotic microangiopathy involving the CNS with seizures in the setting
of high-grade candidemia. She eventually recovered and
was discharged from the hospital. The 100-day nonrelapse
mortality rate was 0% with 1 death from nonrelapse causes
to date as mentioned previously (Table 2).
Outcomes

One patient with SCNSL was lost to follow-up 6 months
after ASCT. The median follow-up for the remaining surviving patients was 24 months with a range of 12 to 40
months. All of the 29 patients who underwent ASCT had
successful engraftment. The median times to neutrophil
engraftment and platelet recovery were 9 days (range, 8-12
days) and 11 days (range, 8-40 days), respectively. The median length of the inpatient hospitalization stay for ASCT
was 23 days (range, 18-56 days) (Table 2). At the first
restaging performed 3 months after ASCT, all 29 patients
had a complete response. The OS and PFS curves are
shown in Figures 1 and 2. For the entire cohort of patients
(n 5 30), when the patient who was lost to follow-up was
treated as an event, the estimated 2-year PFS and OS rates
were 81% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59%-92%) and
93% (95% CI, 76%-98%), respectively. Among patients
with SCNSL, 3 experienced disease relapse after ASCT,
with 2 having systemic disease and 1 having CNS relapse.
The 2 cases of systemic relapse were both in patients in
CR2 or beyond, whereas the 1 case of CNS relapse was in a
patient with SCNSL who was treated in CR1. For all
patients with SCNSL, the estimated 2-year PFS and OS
rates were 51% (95% CI, 18%-77%) and 83% (95% CI,
48%-96%), respectively. None of the 18 patients with
PCNSL have experienced death or relapse thus far.
CSF Rituximab Levels

Rituximab levels were measured in plasma and CSF from
8 patients on the first day of high-dose rituximab229

cytarabine mobilization therapy. Serum levels were measured before and after rituximab, whereas CSF levels were
measured 24-36 hours after completion of administration. The results are shown in Table 3. The median CSF
concentration of rituximab was 347 ng/mL with a range
of <250 to 1310 ng/mL. The median CSF/postinfusion
serum ratio was 0.09% with a range of 0% to 0.375%.
DISCUSSION
PCNSL and SCNSL are devastating diseases with a historically poor prognosis. High-dose chemotherapy with
ASCT during the first or subsequent remission has shown
promise in select patients.13-24,35 We previously reported
our experience with ASCT with TBC conditioning in
patients with CNS involvement by NHL, and we illustrated favorable safety and preliminary efficacy.31 In the
current study, we attempted to improve upon standard
TBC conditioning with the addition of high-dose intravenous rituximab given during both high-dose cytarabinebased mobilization chemotherapy and TBC conditioning

before ASCT in the hope that higher concentrations of
rituximab in the CNS could reduce the risk of disease
relapse. Our results illustrate the safety of such an
approach and compelling efficacy, especially in the 18
patients with PCNSL, none of whom have died or
relapsed to date.
There have been several retrospective and prospective single-arm studies of ASCT in PCNSL or
SCNSL.13-24 For SCNSL, the European Group for
Blood and Marrow Transplantation analyzed 62 patients
with secondary CNS involvement and suggested an
equivalent prognosis after ASCT in comparison with
patients without CNS involvement as long as the CNS
disease was well controlled. Several single-institution series have also demonstrated encouraging results with
ASCT in this setting.14,31,36,37 Recently, using data from
the Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant
Research registry, Maziarz et al38 conducted a large analysis involving 151 patients with a history of CNS NHL
and showed comparable long-term outcomes in

comparison with 4688 patients with NHL and without
CNS involvement who underwent ASCT.
In PCNSL, early studies involving ASCT mainly
concerned relapsed/refractory patients, with a significant
percentage of patients experiencing neurologic toxicity.13,18,19,22,23,39 Soussain et al35 recently described their
large retrospective experience with TBC ASCT in 79
patients younger than 65 years with relapsed/refractory
PCNSL or primary intraocular NHL. Their results
showed encouraging safety and efficacy, especially for
patients who were chemosensitive to salvage treatment
and in remission at the time of ASCT. More recently,
ASCT has been increasingly used as consolidation during
the first remission for PCNSL, and it is now the subject of
current prospective randomized clinical trials comparing
ASCT to other approaches for consolidation. Kasenda
et al40 described the largest series of PCNSL patients
(n 5 34) undergoing ASCT in CR1 with the longest
follow-up (median, 120 months) to date, and they
reported a 5-year event-free survival rate of 79% for
patients who achieved CR1 with initial MTX-based
chemotherapy followed by thiotepa/bischloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) ASCT. Interestingly, in their series, there
were 12 total relapses, with half of such relapses occurring
5 years or later after ASCT; this suggests that the use of
ASCT in PCNSL may be changing the natural history of
the disease.
The data presented in our study add to the growing
literature showing excellent safety and efficacy for a highdose chemotherapy/ASCT–based approach for patients
with both primary and secondary involvement of the
CNS by NHL. Specifically, it reinforces the uncommon
occurrence of cognitive decline with a treatment strategy
comprising high-dose MTX, high-dose cytarabine, and

high-dose chemotherapy with ASCT and omitting
WBRT entirely. Although formal prospective neuropsychiatric assessments were not performed, there were
only 2 cases of significant neurologic toxicity, with only 1
case of late cognitive decline to date. This occurred in a
patient who had previously been treated with WBRT, and
is thus surprising because of the well-described association
of WBRT with an increased risk of neurotoxicity.2,5,6
Ongoing efforts are investigating whether a lower dose of
WBRT can decrease the risk of neurotoxicity.8,41 The
event rate of neurologic toxicity in our study is comparable to the rates in other publications of TBC in PCNSL
and non-TBC high-dose regimens given to patients who
have not previously received WBRT. It is noteworthy that
the only 3 cases of disease relapse witnessed during this
trial involved patients with SCNSL, whereas all 18
patients with PCNSL, including 6 in PR2/CR2, remained
alive and in remission without neurotoxicity. Although
the sample size of our cohort is relatively small, these
results are fairly compelling for PCNSL.
The rationale behind the inclusion of high-dose intravenous rituximab was based on the premise that intravenous rituximab has limited penetration past the bloodbrain barrier yet has been shown to be effective even as a
single agent given intravenously to patients with
PCNSL.32 One previous study of patients with multiple
sclerosis suggested that systemic rituximab concentrations
of approximately 0.1% to 0.2% are achieved in the
CNS.42 Based on samples taken from voluntary lumbar
punctures performed during cytarabine mobilization, our
data confirm that CSF concentrations of rituximab are
indeed roughly 0.1% of those achieved in the serum of
patients after an initial high intravenous dose. Although it
is not clear whether levels measured in the CSF represent
the optimal surrogate for CNS penetration of a drug or
biologic, there is no other feasible tissue to sample and
subject to routine measurement. Because of such limited
penetration of rituximab past the blood-brain barrier, the
achievement of any incrementally higher levels in the
CNS may potentially make a difference therapeutically.
In the future, another method for potentially increasing
the concentration of rituximab in the CNS could be treating patients with high systemic doses concurrently with
the administration of intraventricular rituximab, which
has recently been shown to be safe and effective.43 In addition, to better measure intraparenchymal concentrations,
radiolabeled rituximab could be used, as has been done
preliminarily.44,45
In summary, in patients with either PCNSL or
SCNSL, high-dose intravenous rituximab added to high231

dose cytarabine mobilization followed by high-dose rituximab with TBC ASCT is safe, has low rates of toxicity,
and appears to be efficacious. On the basis of the results,
especially in the 18 patients with PCNSL with no
observed relapses to date, this treatment program comprising high-dose rituximab-cytarabine and R-TBC
ASCT merits further study. Certainly, more follow-up is
needed to determine whether the addition of high-dose
rituximab results in improvements in long-term PFS and
OS in comparison with TBC alone or other ASCT regimens (specifically the combination of BCNU with thiotepa, which is a widely used regimen in this setting).
Importantly, we await the results of the ongoing prospective randomized studies aimed at defining the place for
ASCT in consolidation for patients with PCNSL in hopes
of improving outcomes for those undergoing ASCT by
eventually randomizing patients to high-dose rituximab
with high-dose chemotherapy or high-dose chemotherapy
alone.
