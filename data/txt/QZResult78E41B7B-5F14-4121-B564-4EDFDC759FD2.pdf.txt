response and is used to monitor patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. It
is uncertain how CA125 is affected by molecularly targeted drugs. In this pilot
study, the authors analyzed the utility of CA125 to predict disease behavior in
patients who were receiving sorafenib, a Raf-kinase/VEGFR2 inhibitor, and bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody.
METHODS. Fifteen of 42 patients had recurrent EOC. Patients received sorafenib
200 mg orally twice daily or D1-5 of 7 and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg
intravenously every 2 weeks for 28-day cycles. Computed tomography (CT) scans

had partial response by imaging criteria. Five of these 7 patients had partial
partial responses if CA125 criteria were used; only 5 were confirmed by CT (63 %
specificity). Imaging and CA125 criteria combined yielded a higher total response
rate of 10 of 15 (67%). Three patients with objective partial response by imaging
lasting >20, >22, and >24 cycles would have terminated treatment prematurely
if CA125 had been used.

CONCLUSIONS. CA125 changes may not correspond to imaging response criteria
for EOC patients who are receiving sorafenib and bevacizumab. Caution is
recommended when using CA125 as a response criterion of molecularly targeted
agents until prospective studies validate CA125 changes with objective imaging
response results. Cancer 2008;112:1726–32.  2008 American Cancer Society.

hanges in CA125 concentration are regularly used, alone or in
conjunction with imaging criteria, to determine disease
response to therapy in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Many
studies have demonstrated that serial CA125 values are associated
with objective disease recurrence, response, and progression for
patients who are receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.1 Multiple groups
have proposed criteria to use CA125 changes over time to determine
disease response in clinical trials and in the community.2 The
currently accepted criteria defined by Rustin3 and the Gynecologic
Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) defines 3 categories of response4:

tests at least 1 month apart with no evidence of disease on
imaging;

These criteria have been tested against imagingbased response criteria with mixed results in trials of

There has been considerable interest in biologic
therapeutic strategies in epithelial ovarian cancer.
However, CA125 has not yet been validated as a
marker of outcome in patients treated with biological
therapies. This is an important concern because
biochemical modulation of the tumor may alter production and/or secretion of the mucin MUC16,
recognized by the OC125 antibody.10 The mechanism
of regulation of MUC16 expression has not yet been
elucidated. Thus, it is possible that signal modulation
with molecularly targeted therapy may skew a
CA125-based assessment of clinical behavior. In this
pilot analysis, we retrospectively compared serially
obtained CA125 concentrations with imaging results
for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer treated
with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and sorafenib, a Raf kinase and VEGF-receptor-2 inhibitor.
Our purpose was to determine whether there was an
association between response based on CA125 criteria and standard RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) imaging criteria.11

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors
were eligible for the trial. Written informed consent
was obtained before enrollment. Patients were
required to have evaluable or measureable disease,
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, adequate end organ func-

tion (Table 1), and corrected blood pressure of 140/
90 mm Hg. No chemotherapy or radiation exposure
was allowed within 4 weeks of initiation of therapy.
This clinical trial was approved by the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Md) Institutional Review
Board and has a ClinicalTrials.gov identifier of
NCT00095459.

Trial Design
Patients were enrolled on a phase I dose-escalation
study during which they received concomitant sorafenib (200 mg orally twice daily) and bevacizumab
administered at 5 mg/kg intravenously (dose level
[DL1]; 6 patients) or 10 mg/kg (DL2; 6 patients) every
2 weeks. During investigation of an intermittent sorafenib dosing schedule, 4 patients additionally were
enrolled at sorafenib 200 mg orally twice daily, 5 of
each 7 days, with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2
weeks (DL4). An expansion cohort of 24 patients
received treatment at DL1, the maximal tolerated
dose; these patients were randomized to receive
either single-agent sorafenib or bevacizumab for 1
cycle followed by combination therapy. Fifteen of 41
patients enrolled had epithelial ovarian cancer (Table
2); 9 women with epithelial ovarian cancer received
concomitant sorafenib and bevacizumab on DL1, 2,
or 4, and 6 women were enrolled in the expansion
cohort. Dose modifications were made for grade 3
toxicity or recurrent grade 2 toxicity (graded using
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
for Adverse Events [version 3.0]), excepting hypertension. Patients remained on study absent progression
or significant unmanageable toxicity.12
Patients underwent a focused history and physical examination, urinalysis, and laboratory studies
before each dose of bevacizumab. CA125 was measured at study entry and every cycle thereafter. CA125

concentrations were determined by using the AxSYM
CA125 Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA;
Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill) within the
National Cancer Institute laboratories located at the
National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Tumor
assessment with computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed at most 2 weeks before study
entry and then every 2 cycles (8 weeks). Clinical
decisions on disease response were made by using
only RECIST criteria; Rustin criteria were used for
this analysis.

Statistical Evaluation
We retrospectively reviewed CA125 and imaging
response data from all epithelial ovarian cancer
patients enrolled on this study (N 5 15). Baseline tumor measurement sums were used in comparisons
to determine each patient’s response category by
RECIST criteria. To minimize any potential bias, we
used response categories that were defined before
this analysis by a single reference radiologist.
Changes in CA125 are reported using descriptive statistics. A McNemar test for paired binary data was
used to determine whether there was significant
disagreement between imaging response and CA125
response. Standard definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were used, based on imaging as the gold standard for evaluation of disease
change.

RESULTS
Patients and Clinical Outcome
Patients received a total of 133 cycles as of June 15,
2007, with a median of 5 cycles (range, 2 to 22

cycles). Seven (47%) patients had a partial response
confirmed based on RECIST criteria, occurring at a
median of 3.5 cycles (range, 2 to 16 cycles). A median change in imaging measurements of 43% disease reduction was observed (range, 30% to 89%). An
independent National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) audit on September
21, 2006 confirmed the 5 responses that had occurred as of that date. The 7 patients with responses
all had at least intraperitoneal and/or pelvic disease.
No patients with a partial response progressed while
under treatment as of this writing; 2 patients discontinued treatment for toxicity, 1 withdrew because
of travel considerations, and 4 remain on study
(>8, >13, >20, >24 cycles). The 8 other patients
received a median of 4 cycles2,4–6 before disease
progression.

Outcome Determination Using CA125 Criteria
The Rustin CA125 criteria were used to assess the
CA125 response category of each patient. All but 1
woman had an elevated CA125 before beginning
treatment, making 14 eligible for assessment (Table
2). The median change in CA125 at the first reassessment was a 64% increase in RECIST nonresponders
(n 5 8) and a 63% decrease in patients who had an
eventual RECIST partial response (n 5 7; Fig. 1).
Eight patients would have been deemed partial
responders based on Rustin criteria (median reduction 80%; 62% to 95%), 3 of whom were not confirmed by CT imaging or physical examination (Fig.
2). These 3 patients had a best response of stable
disease by RECIST criteria. The 8 patients who had
partial responses by CA125 achieved response at a

with imaging criteria. Nadir and peak CA125 concentrations while on treatment are shown. Patients on the left side of the figure have documented
sustained partial responses by RECIST criteria. Block arrows indicate pro-

median of 3 cycles (range, 2 to 4 cycles), similar to
that seen with RECIST criteria. No patients with
partial response by CA125 criteria had evidence of
progressive disease with concomitant imaging assessment. When the best outcome of both response
modalities was combined (partial response by either
criteria), the finding was that the study would have
had a response rate of 67% (10 of 15 patients) compared with 47% (7 of 15 patients) by imaging alone.
Figure 3 shows the changes in tumor sum tumor
measurements over time. Five of these 8 patients
were true responders by imaging as well for a positive predictive value of 63%. Three of the 7 patients
who had documented prolonged partial responses by
RECIST criteria would have been removed prematurely from study for disease progression by CA125
criteria at 10, 11, and 18 cycles (Fig. 4). These 3
patients remained on study for >20, >24 cycles, and
22 cycles, respectively (Fig. 1).

Concordance Between Criteria
Response by RECIST imaging criteria was the defined
as the standard for response for this clinical study.
We found a 67% concordance between the 2 measures of CA125 and imaging parameters (10 of 15;
95% confidence interval [CI], 38.3% to 88.1%.).
Accordingly, the sensitivity and specificity of CA125
to determine response was 71% and 67%, respectively. With only 5 discordant results (3 responses
identified only by CA125 and 2 responses only by
imaging), there was no statistically significant disagreement favoring CA125, in terms of calling
responses, by a McNemar test for paired binary data,
(P 5 1.0). The number of subjects was also small,
limiting the ability to detect such a difference.

gressive disease by CA125 Rustin criteria.

DISCUSSION
Eighty percent of patients with advanced stage
epithelial ovarian cancer have elevated CA125 at
diagnosis.13 The biology behind the CA125 glycoprotein is poorly understood. MUC16 is the gene encoding the CA125 protein10; the stimulus for its
production and possible up-regulation in ovarian
cancer, selected other malignancies, and some benign conditions such as endometriosis and peritonitis is not yet known. Yet, in the past 20 years, CA125
has become a major biomarker applied in ovarian
cancer for disease recurrence, response monitoring,
and treatment planning. We hypothesized that molecularly targeted agents may modulate CA125 production and secretion and, thus, possibly affect its
reliability. Our study marks the first analysis of prospectively obtained CA125 samples with concurrent
imaging in a trial of molecularly targeted agents in
epithelial ovarian cancer.
CA125 use has been investigated extensively in
cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although CA125 concentrations at diagnosis are not associated with survival or
extent of disease at diagnosis,14 CA125 is reasonably
reliable in predicting disease progression during initial chemotherapy.15 Early normalization of CA125
during initial chemotherapy with a taxane and a platinum has been found to be positively associated with
survival and negatively with persistence of disease at
second-look laparotomy,14,16–18 as has CA125 nadir
during treatment.19 CA125 concentration has also
been shown to be prognostic of disease course and
survival after completion of initial chemotherapy.
Nadir CA125 after chemotherapy completion has

1730

CANCER

been shown to be predictive of relapse and overall
survival.20–22 After establishment of a complete
response, rising CA125 concentrations are predictive
of disease recurrence,23,24 even when they are rising
within the range of normal values.25,26 CA125 concentrations, when elevated, have also been shown to
track with disease response in recurrent epithelial
ovarian cancer treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Multiple groups have published direct comparisons
of CA125 concentration changes with imaging criteria in trials of paclitaxel, platinum, or cyclophosphamide, alone or in combination, and these trials have
shown CA125 to be equal or better to imaging criteria for prognosis.5,27–30 Etoposide, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and topotecan have also been
shown to be effective in epithelial ovarian cancer on
the basis of CA125 criteria.6,31,32
However, 20% of women with epithelial ovarian
cancer do not have elevated CA125 concentrations,
which adds to the challenge of using CA125 clinically
or in research trials. Moreover, there have also been
published reports that have questioned whether
CA125 overestimates responses or disease progression compared with imaging.9,33 It is controversial
whether CA125 criteria or objective imaging criteria
are the more important response criteria when assessing patient disease on therapy. Our study would
have a similar response rate if CA125 criteria or
RECIST imaging criteria were used exclusively (53%
vs 47%); the elevation in response rate to 67% (10 of
15) occurred with the use of both criteria together.
Yet, in our pilot study, CA125 changes were not in
close agreement with objective imaging, which suggests that CA125 may be a poor surrogate for tumor
shrinkage (67% concordance). More importantly,
there does not appear to be a lead-time effect by
using CA125 criteria to determine disease progression. A recent study by Liu et al. used alternate
CA125 progression criteria to predict disease progression up to 6 months earlier than RECIST or Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria; no correlation of
disease course with this early diagnosis of progression was reported.34 In our study, none of the 3
patients who had progressive disease based on
CA125 changes had any increase in tumor size
(stable partial response by imaging) up to 1 year after the point of progression by CA125 criteria. Larger
studies are needed to determine whether objective
imaging or CA125 criteria are better tools to determine disease behavior and prognosis on a given
therapy.
Changes of CA125 concentrations in patients
with epithelial ovarian cancer have not yet been well
chronicled in molecularly based therapy. Ovarian

cancer cell lines treated with antiepidermal growth
factor therapy of erlotinib or cetuximab showed
increased CA125 release into supernatant medium
even in the presence of cell-growth inhibition.35 The
pivotal phase II trial of bevacizumab in recurrent
ovarian cancer (GOG170D) did not report use of
CA125 concentrations to define response categories.36
Wright et al. reported a response rate of 36% using
both RECIST and CA125 criteria in patients with
ovarian cancer who were treated with bevacizumab
alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy; that response rate fell to 24% when only imaging criteria were used.37 Their trial did not detail
CA125 changes seen in patients with progressive disease. No other molecularly targeted agent has been
shown to have significant activity in ovarian cancer.
There have been limited studies that have looked at
changes in levels of biomarkers that have accepted
use in monitoring disease (CA125, prostate-specific
antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9) after
treatment with molecularly targeted agents. In a
phase II trial of carboxyamido-triazole (CAI), a nonvoltage gated calcium channel blocker, Dixon et al.
reported that 60% of patients treated with this agent
had a transient decrease in prostate-specific antigen
although it was inactive in their study population.38
Dahut et al. found that prostate-specific antigen
changes in patients with advanced prostate cancer
treated with sorafenib may not be associated with
disease response.39
CA125 criteria for response were formulated and
validated in an era of exclusively cytotoxic chemotherapy. Molecularly targeted therapy may affect
CA125 concentrations differently than traditional
chemotherapy. There are insufficient data to determine whether the optimal response criteria by which
we judge new molecularly targeted agents should be
based on imaging, CA125 concentrations, or a combination of the two. The lack of agreement between
standard imaging criteria and CA125 criteria in our
study of molecular agents suggests that CA125 concentration may not be reliable in the same fashion
that it is with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our study,
although provocative, is limited by its small number
of subjects, and at the National Cancer Institute, we
are addressing the question prospectively in an
ongoing phase II trial of sorafenib and bevacizumab
in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer that has an target accrual of 84 patients. This sample size will allow
us to confirm our results in a larger group of
patients.
The activity of these new compounds may be erroneously elevated or depressed without appropriately
validated response criteria. Researchers should exercise

caution in using CA125 response criteria in clinical
trials of molecular agents until criteria have been tested
in prospective trials.
