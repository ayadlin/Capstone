ABSTRACT:
Although Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) was one of the first human cancers to be cured by
chemotherapy, no new agents other than brentuximab vedotin ( Adcetris®, CD 30 directed
antibody drug conjugate) have received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
for HL since 1977. Subsets of young adult patients with HL continue to relapse, even after
stem cell transplantation, warranting new approaches. Against this background, we report a
dramatic response in a young patient with advanced HL refractory to the standard treatment who
responded to the combination of a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (vorinostat, suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid, SAHA) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy
(sirolimus,rapamume). In-depth immunohistochemical and morphoproteomic analyses of this
exceptional responder to targeted therapy have yielded potential insights into the biology of
advanced HL. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a commonly activated pathway in multiple tumor
types including HL. The patient was treated using therapy based on mechanistic in vitro data
demonstrating that combined histone deacetylase (HDAC) and mTOR inhibition act together
on this pathway, resulting in inhibition of reciprocal feedback networks, leading to better antiproliferative activity. The in vivo response signature from this patient’s tissue sample sheds light
on immune dysregulation in HL. We describe the response signature achieved from targeting
immune dysregulation in addition to targeting the key oncogenic PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
We also expand on the role of rapamycin analogs in oncology. This study supports a role for
an immune-type pathogenesis that is amenable to immune modulating targeted therapy in
refractory HL.
Significance:  We report an exceptional responder to molecularly targeted and immune
modulator therapy in advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The morphoproteomic/morphometric
findings in this “unusual responder” patient’s relapsed HL that correlate best, as a response
signature with the subsequent clinical remission following rapamycin (sirolimus) and vorinostat
(SAHA) therapies, center on an immune dysregulation involving an imbalance between effector
and functional T regulatory cells in addition to targeting the mTOR pathway. This underscores the
need for an approach illustrated in our study – namely of focusing on pathogenetic mechanisms
and combinatorial therapies that target both the pathogenesis and adaptive responses to
contemplated therapies.

INTRODUCTION

standard of care ABVD chemotherapy (doxorubicin,
bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) for 6 cycles.
Unfortunately, she had persistent lymphoma. She
then received ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide
(ICE) therapy for 2 cycles with residual lymphoma.
This was followed by high-dose BCNU, etoposide,
cytosine arabinoside, and melphalan (BEAM)
followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. After
transplantation, the patient had persistent lymphoma
in the left supraclavicular area and received radiation
to the left neck with a total dose of 43.6 Gy. She was
subsequently enrolled on an anti-CD30-brentuximab
vedotin study (SGN-35) for 5 cycles. Unfortunately, she
developed progressive lymphoma, which was followed by
a double cord blood transplant. Her lymphoma continued
to progress. She was then started on lenalidomide
with the addition of anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody
(rituximab). Following progression, she was enrolled
on protocol treatment with an AKT inhibitor, MK2206,
(NCT01258998) with progression of lymphoma after 2
cycles and then received 2 cycles on a STAT3 inhibitor
trial (NCT01563302 ). Positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT) scans were done (Figure
1 A), which showed increasing lymphoma involving
lymph nodes, liver, spleen and bones. Unfortunately, she
was not eligible for any clinical trials due to her abnormal
blood counts. Given the patient’s good performance status,
young age and motivation, she was treated with vorinostat,
a pan-deacetylase inhibitor combined with sirolimus, an
mTOR inhibitor. Other than grade 3 thrombocytopenia
requiring platelets, she tolerated therapy reasonably
well. A restaging PET/CT after 3 cycles of therapy
noted a dramatic metabolic response to therapy (Figure
1 B). Throughout the course of this therapy, her Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG

Originally described by Thomas Hodgkin in 1832,
and described as “morbid experiences of the absorbent
glands and spleen”, Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) continues
to be an intriguing, and fascinating lymphoma[1]. Over
time, HL became designated as a lymphoma characterized
by atypical and distinctive Reed-Stenberg and Hodgkin
(R-S/H) cells[2], justifying the use of cytotoxic
chemoradiation therapies[2-6]. The documentation of
clonality in the R-S/H cells, albeit in fewer than 50% of
cases of classic HL, has reinforced the school of thought
that HL is indeed a lymphoma[2-5, 7].  However, the
absence of clonal evolution in most HL cases suggests
that other factors may be responsible for its development
and progression[8]. In short, a common pathogenetic
sequence may be operative in the development of both the
lymphoma and the accompanying clonal evolution, when
present. Immune dysregulation, specifically autoimmunity,
is a commonality that might explain the pathogenesis of
HL in addition to overactive key oncogenic signaling
pathways such as the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway.
Against this background, we report the case of a
patient with advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma refractory
to the standard treatment who eventually responded
to the combination of a pan-deacetylase inhibitor
(vorinostat, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ,SAHA)
and mTOR inhibitor therapy (sirolimus, rapamune®).
Occasionally, in oncology an index patient has a dramatic
and uncommon response to therapy. Much can be learned
by intensively studying the underlying mechanisms of
response in such a patient with the hopes of gaining new
insights that will lead to beneficial new therapies for
refractory lymphoma. We hypothesized that performing
molecular analysis to explicate the response signature in
this “exceptional responder” would help shed light on the
biology of aggressive Hodgkin’s lymphoma and instruct
and possibly predict future patients with this lymphoma.
We present molecular and biomedical analytic evidence
in support of the efficacy of immune modulating therapies
such as the one used to treat our patient in addition to
targeting oncogenic pathways in the successful treatment
of HL. Our findings reinforce the concept of immune
dysregulation in the pathogenesis of classic HL.

DISCUSSION

In order to focus on our attempt to increase T
regulatory (Foxp3) function, the network model evoked
from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, www.ingenuity.
com) and additional MEDLINE sources was edited
to emphasize the companionate lymphocyte reaction in
HL and not the R-S/H cells (see Figure 3). Dashed lines
show the indirect interactions (intermediate interactions
deleted), with red/t-bar for downregulation and green/
arrow for upregulation. Sirolimus inhibits CD8A and
expands FOXP3, countering immune dysregulation. It
also downregulates RICTOR (mTORC2), the putative
serine 473 kinase for Akt. The complementary effects

In-depth
immunohistochemical
and
morphoproteomic analyses of an exceptional responder to
targeted therapy have yielded potential insights into the
biology of advanced HL. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
is a commonly activated pathway in multiple tumor
types including HL[10]. The patient was treated using
therapy based on mechanistic in vitro data demonstrating
that combined histone deacetylase (HDAC) and mTOR
inhibition act together on this pathway, resulting in
inhibition of reciprocal feedback loops, leading to
augmented anti-proliferative activity[10]. The in vivo
response signature from this patient’s tissue sample sheds
light on immune dysregulation in HL.
Through IPA pathway analyses and additional data
mining of the MEDLINE data base as depicted in Figure 3,
sirolimus is shown to inhibit CD8A and expand FOXP3,
countering immune dysregulation. The complementary
effects of sirolimus and vorinostat can be clearly seen in
both upregulating Foxp3 expression and/or stability, and
vorinostat modulating adaptive responses that might be
seen with sirolimus alone.
In addition, vorinostat is known to downregulate
SIRT1 gene mRNA and Sirt1 protein level and
function[11, 12]. In the context of the expression of Foxp3
in the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, it is likely that the
SIRT1 effects a reduction in the suppressive function
of these T regulatory cells[13, 14] which is likely to be
reversed by vorinostat[11, 12].
The premise that HL is pathogenetically linked to
an immune dysregulation is suggested by the following:
1. The reported association of HL with autoimmune
diseases[15]; and 2. The unfavorable prognostic
implications of high numbers of CD8+ and/or TIA+
effector T cells versus the favorable implications of high
Foxp3 T regulatory cell numbers in the companionate
lymphocytes of classical HL[16, 17]. The dramatic and
durable complete clinical response in this patient to
combinatorial therapy with vorinostat and sirolimus ,
when viewed in the context of their immune modulating
properties, coincides with the morphoproteomic findings in
her tissue specimen in supporting an underlying immune
dysregulation of an autoimmune type as a pathogenetic
factor in the patient’s recurrent and previously refractory
lymphoma. Specifically, biomedical analytics applied to
these observations and data in her HL support a role for
sirolimus in downregulating CD8 effector cell function
while upregulating the numbers and suppressive function
of Foxp3 T regulatory cells.  The latter might involve
interaction or synergy with the latency associated peptide

indirect interactions. Red coloration/t-bar: downregulation:
Green coloration/arrow: upregulation. The rationale for
combinatorial therapy with vorinostat and sirolimus (rapamycin)
is reflected in the potential for both the blunting of adaptive
responses of the lymphoma process to rapamycin alone and
also the benefit of combinatorial therapy to effect functional
and expanded T regulatory cells to address an immune
dysregulation. For example, rapamycin can, in the short term,
result in increased phosphorylative activation of p-Akt on serine
473 by removing the feedback inhibition of IGF-1R pathways
signaling through mTORC2. This is countered by vorinostat
through the activation of protein phosphatase (PP); the action of
the latter leads to dephosphorylation of Akt, including on serine
473. Additionally, rapamycin has been shown to upregulate
Sirt1 expression and activity and this would be moderated by the
inhibitory effect of vorinostat on Sirt1 at both the genomic and
functional level. Moreover, because the actions of rapamycin
and vorinostat result in the expansion and function of Foxp3 T
regulatory cells, their use in combination should converge on
righting any immune dysregulation.

of transforming growth factor beta, which one of us (REB)
had previously reported as being expressed in the R-S/H
cells and companionate lymphocytes in classic HL[1820]. Additionally, sirolimus, because of its ability to
inhibit mTORC2 assembly, after long-term exposure may
lead to the cytoplasmic translocation of the mTORC2
component, sin1, and result in reduced mTORC2
degradation of Foxp3, thereby increasing its functional
activity. Furthermore, vorinostat acts to enhance
Foxp3, T regulatory cell expression and function by: 1.
Dephosphorylating Akt on serine 473, reducing the rate
of degradation of Foxp3 effected by mTORC2/Akt (Ser
473)[21] and promoting stabilization of Foxp3 and the
functionality of the T regulatory cells[22] ; 2. Inhibiting
the SIRT1 pathway’s deacetylation of Foxp3 by virtue of
its known ability to downregulate SIRT1 mRNA[11] and
to inhibit the deacetylase activity of SIRT1[12] and, as a
result, to reduce the destabilizing role of SIRT1 on Foxp3
expression and function[13, 14]; and 3. Expanding the T
regulatory cell, Foxp3 population [22]. 
We note that rapamycin and/or rapamycin analogs
have been previously shown to have a role in the treatment
of various malignancies. Sirolimus induces remission of
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders[23, 24] and
of recurrent Epstein Barr virus-associated multilocular
leiomyosarcoma after cardiac transplantation[25].
Relatedly, rapamycin has been reported to induce
rapid regression of lymphadenopathy in a child with
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome[26]. Finally,
rapamycin (sirolimus) and analogs such as temsirolimus
and everolimus, (specifically the latter), have been
approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell
carcinoma(RCC)[27, 28]. However, resistance to these
agents in metastatic RCC can develop in association
with adaptive switching from mTORC1 to mTORC2
signaling pathways and with concurrent activation of
STAT3 and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)
prosurvival/antiapoptotic pathways[28, 29]. This has
been shown in other tumors such as sarcomas as well[3032]. Moreover, in the case of solid tumors not associated
with immune dysregulation, antitumoral immune
surveillance could be compromised using rapamycin as
a therapy by virtue of its potential role in the expansion
and function of T suppressor (regulatory) cells in the
tumoral microenvironment. This underscores the need
for an approach illustrated in our study – namely of
focusing on pathogenetic mechanisms and combinatorial
therapies that target both the pathogenesis and adaptive
responses to contemplated therapies. In addition the role
of rapalogs have expanded in oncology to anti-aging as
well[33, 34]. In pre-clinical models rapalogs have been
shown to prevent age-related weight gain, decrease rate
of aging, increase lifespan, and suppress carcinogenesis in
transgenic cancer-prone mice[33, 35-37].
One of the limitations of this report is that the
prolonged response to sirolimus and vorinostat lasted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

about 3 months before the patient also underwent an
allogeneic transplant. It is difficult to know whether the
subsequent one year remission was due to the sirolimus
plus vorinostat or the allo-transplant. However, the patient
underwent several transplants before the treatment; the
dramatic response to the sirolimus/vorinostat combination
– even if for only 3 months – gave this patient a deep
remission that enabled the next transplant. This benefit
cannot be discounted.
In summary, the morphoproteomic/morphometric
findings in this “unusual responder” patient’s relapsed
HL that correlate best – as a response signature with
the subsequent clinical remission following rapamycin
(sirolimus) and vorinostat (SAHA) therapies – center on
an immune dysregulation involving an imbalance between
effector and functional T regulatory cells in addition to
targeting the mTOR pathway. Morphoproteomic and
biomedical analytics provide a response signature in the
context of immune modulation, raising the question of
immune dysregulation of the autoimmune type in HL.
This supports the phase 1B clinical trial with combinatorial
vorinostat and sirolimus from the immune modulating
perspective, which is IRB approved and actively recruiting
patients (NCT01266057). Preliminary results demonstrate
a progress in the management of Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
even for heavily pre-treated patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the medical record of a patient with HL
who presented to the Department of Investigational Cancer
Therapeutics at the The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center seeking treatment options. Treatments,
attaining informed consent, data collection, and molecular
analysis were performed in accordance with the guidelines
of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
Institutional Review Board (IRB). Molecular analyses
and biomedical analytics were performed (RE Brown’s
Consultative Proteomics Laboratory) to analyze response
signatures.

Immunohistochemistry and Morphoproteomics
The use of bright field microscopy and
immunohistochemistry directed against various protein
analytes can better define the biology of a lymphoma
process and the pathogenetic occurrences that might be
responsible for its development, chemoradioresistance,
and propensity to recur. That is the application
of morphoproteomics[9]. To that end, we applied
immunohistochemical probes against the following protein
analytes in unstained sections of the patient’s original
diagnostic biopsy read as Hodgkin’s lymphoma: CD30
(Dakocytomation Inc., Carpinteria, CA); total insulin-like
growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (R), at tyrosine 1165/1166

on a 0 to 3+ scale based on signal intensity indicated
by a 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
chromogenic (brown) signal. CD8+, TIA-1+ and Foxp3+
were quantified as relative numbers per high power field.
