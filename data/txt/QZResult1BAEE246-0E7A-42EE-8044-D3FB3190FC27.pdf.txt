ABSTRACT
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive neoplastic disorder
in which chemotherapy resistance and refractory relapses occur, with a poorer
prognostic outcome.
Constitutively active PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a common feature of T-ALL
upregulating cell proliferation, survival and drug resistance. This pathway is currently
under clinical trials with small molecules inhibitors (SMI).
To verify whether a multi-inhibition treatment against Akt protein could enhance
the efficacy of individual drug administration and overcome drug resistance as well
as to obtain a decrease in single drug concentration, we tested on T-ALL cell lines
the effects of combined treatments with three Akt inhibitors with different mode of
action, GSK690693, MK-2206 and Perifosine.
In cells with hyperactivated Akt, combined administration of the drugs displayed
a significant synergistic and cytotoxic effect and affected PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
at much lower concentration than single drug use. Highest synergistic effect for
full inhibition of Akt was also related to the timing of every drug administration.
Furthermore the triple treatment had greater efficacy in inducing cell cycle arrest in
G0/G1 phase and both apoptosis and autophagy.
Targeting Akt as a key protein of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway with multiple drugs
might represent a new and promising pharmacological strategy for treatment of T-ALL
patients.

T-ALL accounts for 10–15% of pediatric and 25% of
adult ALL cases [3]. With the current intensified multi-agent
chemotherapy protocols, the 5-year event-free survival
(EFS) of children with T-ALL has reached 70–75%,
whereas the EFS is 30–40% for adults below 60 years of
age, and 10% above this age [4]. However, these therapies
are highly toxic and moreover, relapsed patients often

INTRODUCTION
T-ALL is an aggressive and heterogeneous blood
malignancy disease deriving from T-cell progenitors in
the thymus, with multiple, prognostically relevant genetic
aberrations [1] and is characterized by the over-production
of immature white blood cells [2].

develop resistance to chemotherapy and have an extremely
poor prognosis [5]. Heterogeneity within T-cell leukemia
can cause avoidance of inhibited nodes and selection of
subpopulations of inhibitor-resistant cancer cells [6].
Constitutively active PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
is observed in many types of solid and blood tumors,
including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL),
where it portends a poorer prognosis and negatively
influences response to therapeutic treatments [7].
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal
transduction cascade controls a wide range of
physiological cell processes, including proliferation,
survival, differentiation, metabolism, autophagy,
angiogenesis, exocytosis, and motility [8]. Activation of
PI3K recruits cellular protein kinases that in turn activate
downstream kinases, including the serine/threonine kinase
Akt. Phosphorylation of Akt activates several substrates,
including the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and induces
subsequent phosphorylation of downstream targets such
as S6K. The activation of mTORC1 results in increased
translation and protein synthesis [9]. A second complex
comprising mTOR, known as mTORC2, more recently
described, appears to act as a feedback loop via Akt
phosphorylation on Ser 473 [10].
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR network is involved in
T-ALL survival and drug-resistance and could be targeted
by small molecules inhibitors (SMI) [11]. The PI3K/
Akt/mTOR inhibitors are currently being developed for
clinical use either as single agents or in combination with
conventional chemotherapy for T-ALL patient treatment
[12].
There is a growing interest in multi-component
chemotherapy: the combined delivery of multiple drugs
is an attempt to overcome drug resistances and to improve
clinical outcome.
Therefore we sought to determine whether the
combination of drugs with the same target of action, i.e.
Akt, will result in a more significant biological effect, as
an antiproliferative therapy in order to overcome the risk
of cell growth escape phenomena.
To this aim we employed three drugs directed against
Akt but with a totally different mode of action. GSK690693
is a small molecule ATP-competitive inhibitor of the prosurvival kinase Akt, is a pan-Akt kinase inhibitor, has been
preclinically tested in osteosarcoma and ALL xenografts and
is now in phase I of clinical trials in sarcomas, neuroblastoma,
non-glioblastoma brain tumors and lymphoma [13, 14].
MK-2206 is a novel, orally active, potent and
selective allosteric Akt inhibitor, that inhibits the activities
of all three human Akt (recombinant full length) isoforms,
Akt1, 2, and 3 with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values of 8, 12, and 65 nM, respectively and which
is in phase II of clinical trials and has been tested on
acute myelogenous leukemia [15] and on solid tumors,
including malignant glioma, melanoma and squamous cell
carcinoma [16, 17].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Perifosine, is an orally available alkylphospholipid,
Akt inhibitor, that blocks the recruitment of the pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain of Akt kinase, to prevent its
membrane localization and subsequent activation [18,
19]. It is currently in phase III clinical development for
treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC, in combination
with capecitabine) and of multiple myeloma (MM, in
combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone) [20],
of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [21] and relapsed or
refractory acute leukemia (AML or ALL) [22].
Here, we documented that multiple inhibition of Akt
protein was cytotoxic against T-ALL cells over-expressing
Ser 473 p-Akt and had synergistic effects, with more potent
efficacy than single or double compound administration
at the same concentration. Treatment of T-ALL cells with
the combination of three drugs caused a potent cell cycle
arrest in G0/G1 phase, apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover,
6 h of Perifosine pre-treatment followed by the combined
administration of MK-2206 and GSK690693, was necessary
for the complete switch off of the activated protein.
Our findings suggested that multiple Akt targeting
by drugs with different mechanism of action could
represent a new promising treatment for T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia patients with PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway hyperactivation.

RESULTS
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation status in
T-ALL cell lines
By Western blot analysis, we first evaluated the
phosphorylation status of key proteins of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway in a panel of T-ALL cell lines (JURKAT,
MOLT-4, CEM-S, CEM-R, PEER and BE-13). PEER and
BE-13 cells are characterized by the NUP214-ABL1 fusion
gene mutation, that is the most frequent and highly specific
ABL1 fusion protein for T-lineage acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, that transforms T-cells and is a constitutively
active tyrosine kinase with oncogenic potential [23].
Whereas PEER and BE-13 cells did not displayed
phosphorylated Akt, the other four cell lines displayed
an hyperphosphorylated form, which is indicative of
constitutive activation of PI3K signaling pathway (Fig. 1).
Moreover, we confirmed as previously reported
[24, 25] the absence of PTEN protein expression in most
T-ALL cell lines analyzed, except for PEER and BE-13.
Accordingly to the above observations, Ser 2448 and
Ser 2481 p-mTOR (readout of mTORC1 and mTORC2
activity) were hyperphosphorylated in NUP214-ABL1
negative cells.
In PEER and BE-13 cell lines, PTEN was
phosphorylated at Ser 380, a marker of PTEN posttranslational inactivation and consequent PI3K pathway
activation [26]. However, despite this observation neither
Akt nor mTOR appeared hyperphosphorylated.

each lane. Antibody to β-actin served as a loading control.

Multiple Akt targeting had higher cytotoxic
effect and synergized only in Ser 473 p-Akt
expressing cells

JURKAT cells. We calculated the cell index value (CI)
with Calcusyn Software, to quantify the combined effects
of the drugs, such as synergism or interference. We did
not maintain a constant ratio since it was necessary to
fine tune each drug concentration to better understand the
synergistic or interfering effect and to avoid a too high
cytotoxicity depending on a single drug administered
at a fixed constant ratio. The data analysis (not shown)
indicated strong synergisms in all cell lines, even more
evident in MOLT-4 cells, with the best CI value of
0.101 corresponding to the combination of 0.05 μM
GSK690693, 0.2 μM MK-2206 and 2 μM Perifosine.

We examined by MTT assay the IC50 values of
each drug on the six T-ALL cell lines. After 24 h of
treatment, cell lines displayed different sensitivity to the
single drugs. GSK690693 ranged from 0.31 or 0.21 μM,
in MOLT-4 and JURKAT, to 7 or 5 μM in CEM-R and
-S, respectively. MK-2206 IC50 ranged from 1.7 to 6.9
μM. Perifosine required higher concentration to obtain
IC50 and ranged between 9.35 and 14.65 μM (Fig. 2A)
and this phenomenon is well known and has already been
described [27, 28]. In both PEER and BE-13 the IC50
values of all the drugs was higher than 15 μM (Fig. 2A).
We next studied if the simultaneous administration
of GSK690693, MK-2206 and Perifosine could lead to
a similar cytotoxic effect on the T-ALL cell lines with
a significant decrease of the concentration of every
single drug due to the synergy of the three compound
combination.
Therefore we treated cells with drugs administered
together for 24 h, using the IC50 value as the highest one
and decreasing progressively up to 1/20 of the IC50 value.
MTT assays were then performed.
As shown in Fig. 2B, all the four more responsive
cell lines showed the synergistic cytotoxicity of the
triple drug combination, very significant in MOLT-4 and

Triple Akt hit increases the inhibition of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
To verify if the multiple and simultaneous in vitro
treatment with MK-2206, GSK690693 and Perifosine
could lead to a modulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway,
we checked the phosphorylation status of key components
of this signaling cascade in our panel of more responsive
cell lines. In particular we analyzed p-Akt, its downstream
target, GSK3 α/β, and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase,
readout of mTORC1 activity, after 30 min of drugs
exposure.
GSK690693 and Perifosine were used at 1/2 of
the IC50 concentration, whereas MK-2206 was used at
1/5 of IC50, since half of MK-2206 IC50 concentration

The triple Akt inhibition induces cell cycle arrest
and causes autophagy and pro-apoptotic effects
in T-ALL cells

was enough to completely abolish the Ser 473 Akt
phosphorylation already at 30 minutes.
Akt phosphorylation was affected in different
ways by single drug administration: in all cell lines
MK-2206 very significantly reduced p-Akt, Perifosine
only slightly reduced it and GSK690693 on the contrary
increased the protein phosphorylation. The latter one is
an already described phenomenon [29]. This increase of
Akt phosphorylation diminished the observable effect of
double or triple compound combination, since p-Akt was
not significantly reduced, unless when using MK-2206 in
double exposure (Fig. 3A).
On the contrary, even after such a short time
of treatment, in all of the four cell lines it was very
evident the efficacy of the multiple hit on Akt. The triple
administration of the drugs completely abolished the
phosphorylation on the downstream targets, Ser 21/9
p-GSK3 α/β and Ser 235/236 p-S6, with a much superior
efficacy of the triple exposure when compared with the
single or with the different double combinations (Fig. 3A).
The total amount of the proteins was unchanged in all the
treatments (Fig. 3A).

The significant in vitro antitumor activity of the
triple anti Akt SMI drug combination on T-ALL cells
led us to investigate the mechanisms of its antileukemic
efficacy. To assess the effects of the combined treatment
on the PI3K pathway, we analyzed the effect of triple
treatment on cell cycle progression, given the importance
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the
regulation of cell proliferation [12].
Flow cytometric analysis of PI-stained samples in
JURKAT and CEM-S cells was performed. Cells were
treated with single and triple administration of drugs
for 24 h. The multiple anti Akt treatment increased the
percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, with a
parallel decrease of both S and G2/M phases (Fig. 4).
It has been reported that Akt targeted drugs induce
autophagy in human glioma and T-ALL cells [30, 31].
Therefore, we investigated whether the triple
treatment enhanced autophagy in our T-ALL cell panel.
The exposure of cells to 24 h of the combined treatment
increased the amount of lipidated (14-kDa form) LC3A/B
isoform, a well-established autophagy marker, detected
by western blot in MOLT-4, JURKAT and CEM-S cells
(Fig. 5A).
Interestingly it has been previously reported
that inhibiting autophagy with Chloroquine sensitizes
non small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) to combined
treatment with Akt inhibitors [32].
We then inhibited autophagy using Bafilomycin A1
or Chloroquine and measured cell viability after 24 h of
treatment by MTT assay. Bafilomycin A1 or Chloroquine,
when used alone, did not significantly affect cell viability.
However when each drug was combined with triple
Akt inhibition, it was possible to detect a significantly
increased cytotoxicity in CEM-S and MOLT-4 cells
(Fig.  5B). These findings suggest that autophagy could
protect T-ALL cells by the cytotoxic effects of the Akt
inhibitors.
We next verified the induction of cleaved PARP,
a well established apoptotic marker [33], in JURKAT,
MOLT-4 and CEM-S cell lines by western blotting after
24 h of treatment. The apoptotic effect of the single drug
administration was visible in each cell lines compared to
the control, but was even more evident in MOLT-4 treated
with MK-2206 and CEM-S treated with GSK690693.
Interestingly, the triple administration of the drugs displayed
a higher cleaved PARP in all the three cell lines (Fig. 6A).
To further strengthen this observation we also analyzed
caspase-3, which plays an essential role during apoptotic
cell death [34]: also with this protein the triple exposure to
drugs induced an increased caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 6A).
The percentages of apoptotic cells was examined by flow
cytometry after staining with annexin-V-FITC and PI.

Pre-treatment with Perifosine enhance
synergistic effect
Given that the GSK690693 drug alone led to Ser
473 p-Akt increase, whereas MK-2206 alone almost
turn off the signal, we sought to explore if we can find
a compound combination capable of synergistically
dephosphorylate Akt.
We first tested if there is any concentration capable
to modulate Akt phosphorylation in JURKAT and MOLT4 cells. Therefore GSK690693 was administered at 1/2
of the IC50 value (0.1 μM for JURKAT and 0.15 μM for
MOLT-4 cells) and MK-2206 was contemporary given
at increasing concentrations (0.3–0.5–1 μM). After 30
minutes of exposure, Western blot was performed. The
best drug combination to observe p-Akt modulation
resulted to be 1 μM MK-2206 for JURKAT and 0.5 μM
for MOLT-4 cells (Fig. 3B).
We then analyzed by Western blot the
phosphorylation levels of Akt after treatment with 7 μM
Perifosine at different time points. In both cell lines the
drug affected in a time-dependent manner the Ser 473 Akt
phosphorylation (Fig. 3C).
Finally, we merged the two previous assays pretreating cells for 6 h with Perifosine before a 30 min
administration of GSK690693 and MK-2206.
As shown in (Fig. 3D), in 6 h Perifosine pre-treated
cells, the administration of GSK690693 reduced Ser 473
p-Akt hyperphosphorylation. The combination of all three
drugs allowed to obtain a full Akt dephosphorylation
in both MOLT-4 and JURKAT cells, thus showing
that full Akt inhibition with low drug doses is not only
concentration but also time and drug sequence dependent.

DISCUSSION
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling upregulation is very
common in T-ALL, being detectable in 70–85% of the
patients [38], and portends a poorer prognosis [39].
Although the survival of younger patients with acute
leukemia has improved in the early 21st century, mutations
event can occur at any stage of the disease and negatively
influences the response to therapeutic treatments because
lead to resistance to therapy.
A major challenge remains the lifelong morbidity
suffered by patients treated with current chemotherapy
regimens. For long-term survivors, acute and lasting
toxicities remain important issues underlining the critical
need of more effective and selective personalized and
targeted therapies, and treatment strategies.
A large variety of inhibitors have been widely used
both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical settings of acute

The multiple treatment has the capability to
inhibit ERK pathway
We finally then focused our attention on the MEK/
ERK signaling pathway, which plays an important role in
cell proliferation and growth [36] and potentially mediates
resistance to drug-induced growth inhibition [37].
For this reason, we examined the p-ERK 1/2
phosphorylation status in JURKAT, MOLT-4 and CEM-S
cells, after 24 h of treatment with the three drugs.
Interestingly, the multiple treatment was capable to
downregulate the phosphorylation state of Tyr 202/204

leukemias, where they blocked cell proliferation and
induced, sometimes, apoptosis and/or autophagy [40–43].
Several studies have highlighted that both PI3K and mTOR
modulators could synergize with a wide range of drugs that
are currently in use for treating acute leukemias, including
chemotherapeutic drugs [44, 45]. Drugs dual targeting
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway at various points of the signaling
cascade are under evaluation in preclinical models and
clinical trials, but the observation that not even the combined
inhibition of Akt and mTOR is enough to completely turn off
the pathway during chronic treatment is very intriguing [46].
Despite several chemotherapy combinations were
tested in vitro and are in clinical trials for the treatment
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a new and promising
innovative idea, for the individualization of the therapies,
could be represented by hitting the same target with
multiple specific drugs with different mechanisms of action.
In this study, we demonstrated the efficacy of
multi-inhibition of the same target, i.e. the Akt protein
as a pivotal molecule of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathway with three drugs with a totally different
mechanism of action.
The triple administration of GSK690693, MK2206 and Perifosine in cells with Ser 473 p-Akt
hyperphosphorylation was cytotoxic and synergic at lower
doses when compared with the IC50 values. We showed the
relevance of a fine tuning of the single drug concentration
to obtain the best synergistic effect. Single inhibition of
Akt was lower when compared with every dual inhibition,
which in turn was lower than the triple one.
We also demonstrated the importance of two issues:
the compound concentration and the timing of drugs
administration. About the first one, two of the drugs, MK-2206
and GSK690693 were very efficient acting synergistically
even at low doses, whereas Perifosine administered together
did not add its efficacy in the 10–20 μM range. The second
issue disclosed that MK-2206 and GSK690693 may act very
rapidly (minutes), but Perifosine requires a longer period of
time (hours), to enter in action and to really synergize with
MK-2206 and GSK690693.

These findings indicate that Akt inhibition mechanism
may be compatible with a fine tuning of the concentrations
of the single drugs, that may help with low doses to reduce
the side effect of the therapy, and with crucial time points in
which administer the drugs, that otherwise may improve the
efficacy of the therapy. These needs are present in several
reports already cited in the introduction [15–17, 20–22].
Further studies can sort out this issue.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We also documented the increasing of cleaved PARP
and caspase-3, well known markers of apoptosis, thus
showing this as a mechanism for the cytotoxicity of anti
Akt drugs.
Both autophagy and apoptosis are well-known
biological processes for programmed cell death, that
play essential roles in development, tissue homeostasis
and disease, with interactions among components of the

two pathways [47]. Autophagy is a cellular catabolic
degradation process that results in the autophagosomiclysosomal degradation of cytosolic proteins and other
cellular components [48].
Interestingly, here we demonstrated the increment
of autophagy in multiple anti Akt drugs treated samples.
Moreover, either the Bafilomycin A1 or the Chloroquine
autophagy inhibitors, sensitized cells to treatment. These
findings demonstrated that autophagy is a prosurvival
mechanism that protected cells from Akt inhibitors
induced cytotoxicity and the use of autophagy inhibitors
may be considered in future drug combinations, also in
clinical trials.
Compensatory upregulation of parallel signaling
through the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in response to
PI3K/Akt inhibition, is an emerging theme in cancer
cell signal transduction, because it potentially mediates
resistance to drug-induced growth inhibition [37]. Indeed,
several recent reports have highlighted the importance
of functional crosstalks between the MEK/ERK1/2 and
PI3K/Akt signaling networks, in response to individual
pathway inhibitors [37, 49–53].
The MEK/ERK1/2 pathway often reflects the
rebound of Akt inhibition, developing or amplifying
hyperactivation. Unexpectedly, our results displayed an
inhibition of ERK activation in correspondence of multiple
drugs administration. It is tempting to speculate that the
multi-Akt inhibition could represent an effective treatment
to block crosstalk between PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Raf/
MEK/ERK reducing tumor growth and cells proliferation.
Genomic DNA mutational analysis of Akt1 exons
and adjacent splice sites evidenced a somatic point
mutation in the Pleckstrin Homology domain (PH) of Akt1
gene: a lysine substitution for glutamic acid at the amino
acid 17 (E17K). This genetic alteration was originally
identified in solid tumors [54, 55]. Cystallography studies
demonstrated that E17K mutation modified Akt1-PH
conformation and disrupted ionic interaction with Lys 14
in the lipid-binding pocket of Akt1 [56]. This mutation
have effects on sensitivity to targeted pathway inhibitors,
since it has been recently reported that the Akt1- E17K
mutant cells maintained higher levels of Akt1 Ser 473
phosphorylation even with increasing concentrations of
MK-2206 [57].
Very recently a total of five Akt1 variants such as
E17K, E17S, E319G, L357P, and P388T were found to
exert deleterious effects on the protein structure and
function. Furthermore, the molecular docking study
indicated the lesser binding affinity of inhibitor with
the mutant structure than the native type. Moreover, the
findings strongly indicated that screening for Akt1, E17K,
E17S, E319G, L357P, and P388T variants may be useful
for disease molecular diagnosis and also to design the
potential Akt inhibitors [58].
Therefore it appears of great importance to hit Akt as
a pivotal molecule in cancer development and progression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with drugs acting with multiple mode of action, to
overcome the potential resistance due to mutations in the
site of action of the single drug.
There is great clinical interest in determining
whether mutations in the PI3K signaling pathway can
serve as biomarkers to predict sensitivity to drugs
targeting the pathway. Thus, the presence of Akt mutations
or of PI3K/Akt/mTOR hyperactivation should be taken in
account when establishing a therapeutic regimen for the
patient. This is an important issue toward the personalized
medicine, since it is useless to activate a treatment if the
correspondent pivotal cytotoxic target is absent [59].
In conclusion, our preclinical finding strongly
demonstrated that a multiple inhibition of Akt could
represent a new promising therapeutic strategy to
overcome relapse or resistance in the treatment of T- ALL
patients with hyperactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
RPMI-1640 medium, fetal bovin serum (FBS),
penicillin and streptomycin were from Lonza (Lonza
Milano SRL, Milan, Italy). Perifosine, GSK690693, and
MK-2206 were from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX,
USA). For cell viability determination, Cell Proliferation
Kit I (MTT) was purchased from Roche Applied Science
(Basel, Switzerland). Annexin V/7-AAD detection kit
was from Merck-Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). Akt-1,
Ser 473 p-Akt-1, Tyr 202/204 p-ERK 1/2 and ERK 1/2
primary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA) while all the other antibodies
were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,
USA), including the rabbit secondary antibody. The
mouse secondary antibody, Bafilomycin A1, Chloroquine
and Z-VAD-fmk were from Sigma Aldrich (Milan,
Italy). Signals were detected with the ECL Plus reagent
purchased from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA, USA).

Cell culture and Western blot analysis
The T-ALL cell lines were obtained from Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH
(Braunschweig, Germany). JURKAT, MOLT-4, CEM-S
(drug sensitive) and CEM-R (CEMVBL100, drug-resistant
cells overexpressing 170-kDa P-glycoprotein)were grown
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS); PEER and BE-13
were grown in RPMI 1640 with 20% FBS. All the media
were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100
mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown at a density of
0.5 to 2 × 106 cells/ml and were incubated at 37°C with
5% CO2. Western Blot analysis was performed by standard
methods as described elsewhere [60].

Cell cycle analysis

REFERENCES

Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium
iodide (PI)/RNase A staining by flow cytometry according
to standard techniques, as described elsewhere [62]. In
brief, after 24 h of drug treatment, cells were harvested,
centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min and washed once
with 1X PBS. After fixing them with 70% ethanol at
20°C, cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min and
washed once with 1X PBS. Then 100 μl of propidium
iodide (PI)/RNase A staining was added to each tube
with an incubation of 30 min at room temperature in
the dark. Samples were then analyzed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

PI/Annexin V assay
To determine the extent of apoptosis induction,
flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI-stained
samples was performed [20]. Samples were analyzed on
an FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) with the
appropriate software (CXP, Beckman Coulter) [60].

Combined drug effect analysis
The combination effect and the potential synergy
of Perifosine, MK-2206 and GSK690693 were evaluated
from quantitative analysis of dose–effect relationship, as
described previously [63].
For each combination experiment, a combination
index (CI) number was calculated using the
BiosoftCalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). This
method of analysis generally defines CI values from 0.9 to
1.1 as additive, from 0.3 to 0.9 as synergistic and below
0.3 as strongly synergistic, whereas values over 1.1 are
considered as antagonistic.
