Abstract
Because topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is critical for the relaxation of DNA supercoils and because it is the target
for the anticancer activity of camptothecins, we assessed TOP1 transcript levels in the 60 cell line panel (the
NCI-60) of the National Cancer Institute's anticancer drug screen. TOP1 expression levels varied over a 5.7-fold
range across the NCI-60. HCT116 colon and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were the highest expressers; SK-MEL-28
melanoma and HS578T breast carcinoma cells were the lowest. TOP1 mRNA expression was highly correlated
with Top1 protein levels, indicating that TOP1 transcripts could be conveniently used to monitor Top1 protein
levels and activity in tissues. Assessment of the TOP1 locus by array comparative genomic hybridization across
the NCI-60 showed copy numbers ranging from 1.71 to 4.13 and a statistically significant correlation with
TOP1 transcript levels (P < 0.01). Further analyses of TOP1 expression on an exon-specific basis revealed that
exon 1 expression was generally higher and less variable than expression of the other exons, suggesting some
form of transcriptional pausing regulation between exons 1 and 2. Accordingly, we found the presence of multiple evolutionarily conserved potential G-quadruplex–forming sequences in the first TOP1 intron. Physicochemical tests for actual quadruplex formation by several of those sequences yielded quadruplex formation
for two of them and duplex formation for one. The observations reported here suggest the hypothesis that
there is a conserved negative transcription regulator within intron 1 of the TOP1 gene associated with a quadruplex-prone region. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2191–203. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) catalyzes DNA strand breakage
through the reversible formation of covalent bonds between
an enzyme tyrosyl oxygen and a DNA phosphorus (1). The
strand breakage/religation allows relaxation of DNA supercoiling to facilitate the diverse processes of replication, transcription, repair, recombination, and chromatin remodeling

(1–3). Top1 is therapeutically important because Top1 inhibitors derived from the plant alkaloid camptothecin (topotecan and irinotecan) are routinely used to treat colon, ovarian,
and lung cancers in adults and neuroblastoma and sarcoma
in children. Noncamptothecin Top1 inhibitors are in preclinical development (1, 4).
Top1 is expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells, including nonreplicative and postmitotic cells. Expression of the
TOP1 gene is essential in animals, and its homozygous disruption is early embryonic lethal (5). Even its underexpression leads to alterations in DNA replication and genomic
organization (6). Reduced levels of Top1 may be rate-limiting
for the relaxation of positive DNA supercoiling ahead of replication and transcription complexes (1, 6, 7). Accumulation
of supercoiling may promote replication fork collapse and
transcriptional R-loops (8). TOP1 overexpression is also toxic
(9). Too much Top1 may promote the formation of Top1
cleavage complexes at endogenous DNA lesions (abasic sites,
mismatches, oxidized bases, nicks, and DNA adducts; refs. 1,
10). Top1 protein levels are also critical for responses to anticancer therapy; cell killing by Top1 inhibitors, including
camptothecins and indenoisoquinolines, is positively correlated with Top1 expression (6, 11–15).
The 60 cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Developmental Therapeutics anticancer
screen exhibit differential expression patterns, which is an

asset in identifying relationships to general processes, such
as alterations in DNA copy number and pharmacologic response (16, 17). In a recent study, we showed that Top1 expression varies significantly across the NCI-60 and that Top1
protein expression is significantly correlated with TOP1
mRNA expression across those cells (18). The NCI-60 panel
(19, 20) constitutes a unique database for pharmacologic inquiry, because it has been characterized more extensively at
the DNA, RNA, protein, chromosomal, functional, and pharmacologic levels than any other set of cells in existence8 (17,
20–24).
The aim of the present study was to take advantage of our
multifaceted molecular profiling of the NCI-60 to elucidate
genetic mechanism(s) that regulate TOP1 transcript expression. For that purpose, we integrated data on (a) TOP1 transcript expression, using data from three different platforms,
Human Genome U95 (HG-U95; ref. 24), Human Genome U133 (HG-U133; ref. 24), and Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0
(HG-U133 Plus 2.0); (b) TOP1 transcript expression at the exon level for the 21 TOP1 exons using Affymetrix GH Exon 1.0
ST Arrays; (c) TOP1 protein expression (18); and (d) DNA
copy number, by array comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH) using NimbleGen arrays from the NCI-60 screen.
Those joint profiling data generated a hypothesis about the
regulation of TOP1 expression that we then followed up with
biochemical and biophysical studies.

Materials and Methods
Quantitation of Top1 transcript expression using three
microarray platforms. As described previously (18), transcript expression data for the NCI-60 were obtained from
our Affymetrix Human Genome U95 Set (HG-U95; ∼60,000
features; Affymetrix, Inc.) and Human Genome U133 (HGU133a and b; ∼44,000 feature; ref. 24). We also analyzed data
for TOP1 from our Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays
(HG-U133 Plus 2.0; ∼47,000 features). We used GC robust
multi-array average (RMA) normalization for the HG-U95
and HG-U133. RMA was used for the HG-U133 Plus 2.0
(25). To be included in the calculation of TOP1 expression
levels (Fig. 1A), probe sets were required to have an intensity
range of ≥1.2 log2 and be consistent to the pattern of expression of the other probe sets, using a Pearson's correlation coefficient cutoff of ≥0.52. Probes that passed these quality
controls (Fig. 1A) were used to calculate the z score9 average
for TOP1 by first determining the z score for each probe by
subtracting the 60-cell mean and dividing by the SD (the second to last and last rows of numbers in Fig. 1A, respectively)
and then averaging the resulting values for each cell line.
Data from the HG-U95 and HG-U133 microarrays can be
accessed at our relational database, CellMiner.8
The sequence within TOP1 that the individual probes
(that make up the probe sets) from the HG-U95, HG-U133,

and HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays hybridize to were visualized
(Fig. 1C) using SpliceCenter.10 SpliceCenter is a suite of
user-friendly tools that evaluate the effect of gene splice variation on a variety of molecular biological techniques.
Exon-specific Top1 transcript expression. Transcript expression data for each of the 21 TOP1 exons were obtained
using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST (GH Exon
1.0 ST) Array according to manufacturer's instructions (chips
for the studies from John Ward, Thomas Gingeras, and colleagues at Affymetrix). Assays were run at GeneLogic (under
the aegis of E. Kaldjian) following manufacturer's recommendations. Technical triplicate arrays were hybridized for each
cell line, except for renal UO-31, which was done in duplicate,
and central nervous system (CNS) SF-539, which was missing. Transcript data were normalized by RMA (25) using Partek Genomics Suite version 6.3.
To calculate mean-centered intensities across cell lines for
each probe set, the technical triplicates for each cell line were
averaged for each probe set. All probe sets were then qualitycontrolled for either being at background levels for all cell
lines (and thus uninformative about pattern) or being “dead”
(unresponsive, although not at background). Probes that
failed either of those criteria were dropped from further analysis. When there were multiple probe sets for a single exon,
averages were taken next to yield a single value for each
exon.
Data for each exon were next mean-centered across the 59
cell line intensities available (CNS SF-539 was unavailable).
The mean-centered intensity values (M) for each exon were
calculated as M = intensity value for the exon − (average of
intensity values for the exon across 59 cell lines).
Visual representations of the TOP1 introns, exons, and
probe locations were generated using SpliceCenter10 and
the clustered image map (Fig. 3A) generated by CIMminer.11
The statistical significance (P = 2.2 × 10−16) of differences
in intensity between TOP1 exon 1 and exons 2 to 21 was calculated by Welch's t test on the basis of measurements using
182 microarrays. On each array, there were four probes specific for exon 1 (yielding 4 × 182 = 712 measurements) and 33
probes specific for exons 2 to 21 (yielding 33 × 182 = 6,006
measurements).
Exon and intron 1 nucleotide information and G-quadruplex identification. Human, mouse, and rat sequence information was obtained from National Center for
Biotechnology Information.12 For Fig. 3A, the exon sizes were
derived from information obtained from locus NM_003286.
The TOP1 intron 1 sizes and sequences were obtained from
locus NC_000020, NC_000068, and NC_005102 for human,
mouse, and rat, respectively. Fly sequences were obtained
from FlyBase.13 The complementary strand sequence was
generated using the Molecular Biologist's Workbench's Data

TOP1 Transcription and G-Quadruplexes

Results
TOP1 transcript expression across the NCI-60. To determine relative transcript levels of TOP1 in the NCI-60, we used
six probes from three different microarray platforms: HGU95 (24), HG-U133 (24), and HG-U133 Plus 2.0. Figure 1A
displays these relative levels both as intensity values and as
the z score average. The use of z scores allows comparison of
relative levels for data distributions with different means
and/or SDs. Values obtained for probes from the three platforms were consistent with each other (mean Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.72, with a range of 0.52–0.93). The six
probes, two of which appear in both HG-U133 and HG-U133
Plus 2.0, hybridize to exons 1 to 6 and 18 to 21 (Fig. 1C), with
the majority of probes targeting the 3′ end of the gene. TOP1
expression in the NCI-60 varied over a 5.7-fold range, within 1
SD of the average transcript variation (a 9.0-fold range) for 26
housekeeping genes (as defined in ref. 31).
Colon HCT116 and breast MCF-7 cells showed the highest
TOP1 mRNA levels, and breast HS578T and melanoma SKMEL-28 showed the lowest (Figs. 1A and 2A). The six leukemia cell lines and six of the seven colon carcinoma cell lines

consistently expressed high TOP1 mRNA (Fig. 1A, B). Their
average z scores (0.86 and 0.89, respectively) were >3.7 times
that of the next highest tissue of origin type, ovarian, at 0.23.
HCC-2998 cells were the only colon carcinoma cells with lower than average TOP1 transcript levels. The breast and prostate lines were the most variable in TOP1 expression, with
SDs of 1.25, and 0.95, respectively. The renal lines were the
lowest expressers (Fig. 1A, B), with an average z score of
−0.83. Breast, CNS, and melanoma formed a second tier of
negative expressers, with z-score averages of −0.16, −0.35,
and −0.34, respectively. TOP1 transcript and protein levels
correlated with one another at statistically significant levels
(r = 0.80, P < 0.001; ref. 18).
TOP1 DNA copy number and transcript levels correlate
with each other at statistically significant levels across the
NCI-60. To evaluate whether DNA copy number contributes
to TOP1 expression, we used aCGH to determine average
copy number levels for the TOP1 locus and two megabases
of flanking region on both sides of it. Those levels were obtained from our studies using NimbleGen 385,000-feature
Human Whole-Genome CGH arrays. Based on the average
intensities of 15 tiled probes specific for the TOP1 locus,

NOTE: Cell lines ordered as in Fig. 1A.

DNA copy numbers ranged from 4.13 for the breast cancer
line MCF-7 to 1.71 for the melanoma SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 2A,
left). Comparison of the average transcript z scores
(Fig. 1A, last column of the tabular data and Fig. 2A, right)
with the average estimated DNA copy number indicates a
statistically significant correlation (r = 0.33, P < 0.02, without
multiple comparisons correction). Those results suggest that
TOP1 amplification can contribute to increased expression
levels in cancer cells.
Within the portion of chromosome 20 for which copy
number was estimated (i.e., from nucleotides 37,103,339 to
41,095,315), 57 of the cell lines showed relative invariance
in their average copy number (within the limits of reliability
and variability of the individual probes). HS578T exemplifies
that type of profile (Fig. 2B, middle). Only two cell lines,
breast cancer MCF7 and lung cancer NCI-H322M, showed
variation around the TOP1 locus (Fig. 2B, top and bottom,
respectively). In MCF7, there is amplification of an ∼1.7 ×
10 6 nucleotide region that contains TOP1 (Fig. 2B, red
squares). In the NCI-H322M cells, there is an ∼2-fold increased copy number toward the p-end of chromosome 20
and a reduction in average copy number at the TOP1 locus.
Exon analysis of TOP1 reveals differential expression
between the first and the other exons. To expand our transcript assessment and consider potential exon-specific variation, we next examined the intensity levels for each of the
21 TOP1 exons using the GH Exon 1.0 ST Array (see Supplementary Table S1). This platform was in agreement with the
other three transcript platforms for TOP1 expression, with
average correlations of 0.86, 0.82, and 0.73 (all significant
with P < 0.0001) for HG-U95, HG-U133, and HG-U133 Plus
2.0, respectively. Analysis of the GH Exon 1.0 ST Array indicated that the probe intensities for exon 1 were higher on
average (by ≥1.87-fold, linear) than those for exons 2 to 21, with
the higher expresser cell lines, such as HCT-116 and MCF7

(ranked in Fig. 1A) having less of a drop off (1.37-fold and
1.50-fold linear change, respectively) than the lower expresser
cell lines, such as HS578T and SK-MEL-28 (2.23-fold and 2.19fold linear change, respectively). For all cell lines, the average of
the exon 1 minus the average of the exon 2 through 21 probe
sets is positive (Supplementary Table S1, last column), indicating the intensity reduction following intron 1.
Next, to partially compensate for variations in probe set
hybridization efficiency, we mean-centered the probe set average log2 intensity values for each exon across the NCI-60
(results in Table 1). Using the data in this form allows one
to more clearly identify potential specific exon level fluctuations. Figure 3A shows a clustered image map visualization of
these mean-centered intensity values. The vertical strip representing exon 1 stands out as having less color variation
and thus less mean-centered intensity variation than do
the other exons. The horizontal blocks of color indicate that
most cell lines are otherwise consistent in their mean intensity levels across exons 2 to 21. Assessment of the mean-centered log 2 intensities by cell line, including their 95%
confidence intervals (Supplementary Fig. S1A, B, and C), indicates that few examples of exon-specific transcript variation occur within exons 2 to 21 for TOP1.
The deviations from the (60-cell) mean for the Table 1 data
for four individual exons are depicted quantitatively in Fig. 3B,
reflecting what was seen in Fig. 3A. That is, from the lengths of
the red bars, it is apparent that exon 1 has less deviation from
the mean than the other three exons shown. The same is true
also for the other 17 exons (for all exons, see Supplementary
Fig. S1), substantiating the observation of reduced exon 1 variation from Fig. 3A. That point is reinforced in tabular form as
well by the SDs of the mean-centered log2 intensities for each
exon across the NCI-60 (Table 1, second row from bottom). The
SD is the least for exon 1, at 0.20, with an average of 0.47 (with a
range of 0.35–0.67) for exons 2 to 21.

Those results indicate that (a) TOP1 mRNA expression is generally less variable for exon 1 than for exons 2 to 21, (b) the TOP1
transcript levels generally decrease between the exons 1 and 2
probe sets, and (c) there is a greater drop-off in the lower expressers compared with the higher expresser cell lines.
TOP1 intron 1 contains potential quadruplex-forming
G-rich sequences. Due to these transcript variations found
between TOP1 exons 1 and 2, we took a detailed look at intron 1 for potential secondary structure-forming motifs
(Fig. 4A). The first intron of human TOP1 is among the smallest in the TOP1 gene, consisting of 330 bp. Examination of
the sequence composition of human intron 1 using the quadruplex-forming G-rich sequences (QGRS) Mapper15 algorithm
revealed six and five potential quadruplex-forming G-rich sequences (depicted as the lighter bars in Fig. 4B) within the
coding and transcribed strands, respectively. Chimpanzee,
mouse, and rat TOP intron 1 (see Fig. 4B) are relatively conserved in both size and number of potential quadruplexforming G-rich sequences. Drosophila is more disparate, with
intron 1 containing 1,346 nucleotides and 4 potential quadruplex-forming G-rich sequences in both its coding and transcribed strands (data not shown).
Evidence for quadruplex formation in vitro. Of the QGRS
Mapper algorithm identified potential quadruplex sequences
on both DNA strands of Intron 1, manual inspection suggested
that the most stable (quadruplexes) were located on the transcribed strand. To confirm the propensity of these motifs to
form quadruplexes, we synthesized three oligodeoxynucleotides (21, 25, and 30 bases long) that mimicked parts of intron
1 (located in Fig. 4B beneath the human intron 1, with the sequence depicted in Fig. 5A). Standard physicochemical methods were used to reveal quadruplex formation (32). For the 21and 25-mers, UV melting profiles showed a clear inverted transition at 295 nm, consistent with G4 quadruplex formation
(Fig. 5B; ref. 27). The 21-mer was highly stable (Tm of 75°C in
K+). Furthermore, this Tm depends on the nature of the cation

www.aacrjournals.org

(K+ > Na+; data not shown). The TDS (Fig. 5C) and CD spectra
(Fig. 5D) for both sequences were consistent with G4 formation. In contrast, the 30-mer, despite being very G-rich, did not
exhibit the same behavior (no transition at 295 nm and different CDS and TDS). Altogether, those results indicate that two
of the three sequences form bona fide quadruplexes whereas
the longest one (30-mer) forms a duplex.
We then analyzed the molecularity of the 21-mer, which
shows a fully reversible melting profile. We measured the
Tm at different strand concentrations (between 2 and 30
μmol/L). The Tm was concentration independent (data not
shown), confirming that the quadruplexes are intramolecular
(33). We could not perform a similar experiment with the 25mer, because its melting was more complex and it showed
hysteresis, probably as a result of the formation of multiple
quadruplex species of different molecularities.
The melting experiments indicated that at least two sequences in the transcribed strand tend to form quadruplex
structures and that the one formed with the 21-mer is extremely thermally stable. Nevertheless, a Tm value is of limited
value for assessing the “strength” of a quadruplex under physiologic conditions; a free energy of transition would be more
predictive. We therefore performed a van't Hoff analysis of the
melting profiles and found a ΔG°37°C value of −8.6 kcal/mol.
That value provides an indication of the high thermodynamic
barrier for unfolding of the G4 structure to let the transcription machinery pass through this structure. However, the value of ΔG°37°C should be interpreted with caution because it
relies on a number of assumptions (such as two-state behavior
and temperature-independent enthalpy) and extrapolations
with respect to the nature of the cellular environment (33).

Discussion
TOP1 is viewed as a housekeeping gene because its homozygous deletion is embryonic lethal (5) and its expression

Reinhold et al.

is restricted across cell cycle stages (34). In this study we
used high throughput microarray analyses to elucidate regulatory genetic determinants of TOP1 transcript expression
across the NCI-60 and explored two potential influences on
TOP1 expression: transcriptional pausing and DNA copy
number variation. The correlation between TOP1 expression
and copy number of 0.33 was higher than prior multigene
correlation averages of 0.29 and 0.23 (16), suggesting that
TOP1 copy number alterations in cancers can influence the
transcript level.
To compare TOP1 transcript levels across the NCI-60 cell
lines and across our six Affymetrix probe sets (on HG-U95,
HG-U133, and HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays), we used average
z scores.9 z scores facilitate the integration of data from multiple platforms because they are mean-centered and normalized with respect to SD. Average z scores for TOP1 expression
provided a single value for each of the NCI-60 lines (see
Figs. 1A, B and 2A). Those values were used to rank the cells
and for comparison with aCGH (Fig. 2A). Use of z scores, as
opposed to individual probe set data, for TOP1 transcript levels yielded generally higher correlations with both TOP1 protein expression (18) and TOP1 DNA copy number (Fig. 2A). The
TOP1 transcript expression at relatively low levels in the renal
and at high levels in the leukemia and in six of the seven colon
carcinoma lines (Figs. 1A, B and 2A) was consistent with our
recent results using an ELISA assay to measure TOP1 protein
levels (18).
Recent studies have shown that transcription can be regulated for many genes after establishment of the preinitiation complex (35, 36). Having found that TOP1 expression
was variable from cell line to cell line across the NCI-60,
we looked for differential expression across the 21 exons of
the TOP1 gene using our data from the exon-specific Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST microarray. An asset in
organizing and visualizing the exon array data was our SpliceCenter tool (37), which provided (a) automated visualizations of the translated and untranslated regions of the TOP1
gene; (b) the relative exon sizes and locations of introns; and
(c) the portions of the exons being assessed by the individual
probe sets (examples in Fig. 1C). Interpretation of inter–cell
line transcript level variation was made possible by the relatively large number of arrays (156) used in this study. As
probe set intensities are not directly interpretable with respect to differences among exons because of variability in
hybridization efficiency between individual probes, we developed a mean-centering approach and looked for variation
across cell lines for each individual exon. Mean-centered intensities, as seen in Fig. 3 for exon 1, can provide indications
of exon-specific transcript variations. Analogous transformation of exon array data from genes other than TOP1 should
likewise be useful for detection of exon-specific transcript
variation.
Our analyses based on the GH Exon 1.0 ST microarray
revealed only very limited variation in exon 1–specific transcript intensities across the NCI-60 compared with differences across cell lines for the other 20 exons (see Fig. 3).
The cell lines with the highest TOP1 expression (such as
colon carcinoma HCT-116) seem to allow the transcription

2202

Cancer Res; 70(6) March 15, 2010

process to pass through intron 1 more readily than do the
low-TOP1 expressers (such as breast carcinoma HS578T).
In the latter, transcription seems to be impeded within intron 1. Those observations suggested the existence of a negative transcription regulator within intron 1 of the TOP1 gene
in humans. Further analysis showed that intron 1 is relatively
short and conserved among vertebrates (see Fig. 4A and B),
containing multiple potential quadruplex-forming G-rich sequences. This implies similar potential for the formation of
secondary structures in these vertebrates.
Sequences that form quadruplexes have been generally
found to regulate transcription within promoter regions.
For instance, quadruplexes in the promoters of the HIF1A,
KRAS, CMYB, and CMYC genes (38–42) have been found to
repress transcription initiation. Our findings for the TOP1
gene highlight the potential role of quadruplex-forming Grich sequences for regulating transcription in the body of
genes. They are consistent with a recent report showing
the preferential enrichment of potential quadruplex sequences in the first introns of a large number of human
genes (43). Potential quadruplexes were significantly overrepresented on the nontemplate DNA strands (43). In the case of
the TOP1 gene, potential quadruplex sequences in the first
intron were present in both the transcribed (nontemplate)
and coding strands, but the sequences with the highest potential were on the transcribed strand. Biochemical and biophysical evidence provided here indicates that the sequences
with potential for G-quadruplex formation can actually form
such structures, at least in vitro (see Fig. 5).
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use
exon-specific expression data for recognition of potential intronic secondary structure leading to the restriction of transcript elongation. The approach, practiced across panels of
cell lines such as the NCI-60, could be useful for detection
of intronic transcription pausing in other genes.
In summary, the present study describes (a) the relative levels of TOP1 within the NCI-60, (b) a significant association
between TOP1 expression and DNA copy number, (c) the existence of a reduction of TOP1 transcript level following exon
1, (d) the existence of reduced variability of exon 1 (compared
with the other 20 exons), (e) the presence of multiple potential
guanosine quadruplexes within intron 1, and (f) the verification of the guanosine quartet formation by two of these by
physicochemical methods. This form of exon-specific transcript variation analysis across the NCI-60 allows the recognition of inhibitory elements within the introns of genes. Based
on this approach, we suggest, for the first time, the existence of
a transcriptional pausing event in the first intron of TOP1 and
provide a plausible mechanistic explanation based on the presence of G-quadruplex regions.
