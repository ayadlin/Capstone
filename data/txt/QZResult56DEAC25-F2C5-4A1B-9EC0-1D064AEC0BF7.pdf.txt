ABSTRACT
Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. It is suggested
that 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a tobacco-specific
nitrosamine, mediates the carcinogenic action of cigarette smoking by promoting
cancer growth. In the present study, we show that smoking, HIF-1α expression
and β2-adrenogenic receptor (β2-AR) expression are negatively correlated with the
overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, HIF-1α expression and β2AR expression are positively correlated with smoking status, different histological
differentiation and among the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stages in pancreatic cancer
patients. NNK increases HIF-1α expression in pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, knockdown of HIF-1α and ICI118, 551 (a β2-AR selective antagonist)
abrogates NNK-induced pancreatic cancer proliferation and invasion in vitro and
inhibits NNK-induced pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. However, using CoCl2 (a HIF-1α
stabilizing agent which decreases HIF-1α degradation under normoxia conditions)
reverses ICI118, 551 induced effects under NNK exposure. Thus, our data indicate that
β2-AR signaling regulates NNK-induced pancreatic cancer progression via upregulation
of HIF-1α. Taken together, β2-AR signaling and HIF-1α may represent promising
therapeutic targets for preventing smoking induced pancreatic cancer progression.

formed from nicotine by nitrosation during the processing
of tobacco in the mammalian organism [5]. Metabolites
formed from NNK are strong mutagens that induce
activating point mutations in k-Ras and inactivating
mutations in p53 [6], both of which are common in
human lung cancer and PDAC [7–10]. Previous studies
indicate that smoking-stimulated NNK production and
stress-stimulated activation of the autonomic nervous
system promote tumor progression [11, 12]. Activation
of the autonomic nervous system results in the release of
catecholamines from the adrenal gland and sympathetic

INTRODUCTION
With a 5-year survival rate of less than 6% and
more than 37,000 deaths per year, pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the most
lethal human cancers and is the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related death in the United States [1]. Increasing
evidence suggests that many factors such as smoking,
stress, and chronic depression may contribute to PDAC
genesis and development, but the underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood [2–4]. The carcinogen NNK is

nerve terminals. Further studies suggest that both NNK
and constitutive high levels of catecholamines modulate
the activity of multiple components of the tumor
microenvironment and consequently promote tumor cell
growth via β-AR [4, 13–15].
β-AR are members of the superfamily of G proteincoupled adrenergic receptors, which mediate the actions
of the endogenous catecholamines in a variety of target
cells [16, 17]. β1- and β2-AR have been found to be
expressed in the BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2, and Panc-1
cell lines [18–20]. NNK functions as a β-AR agonist
to induce cancer progression in vitro [21]. It has been
shown that the binding of NNK to the β-ARs induce
pancreatic cancer cell proliferation by activating the
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase
A (PKA) pathways in pancreatic cancer cells [22]. The
consequence of PKA signaling leads to the transcriptional
activation of proteins involved in proliferation via cAMP
response element binding protein (CREB), activator
protein-1 (AP-1) or nuclear factor ‘kappa-light-chainenhancer’ of activated B-cells (NF-κB) [22–24]. We
recently showed that β2-AR inhibitor ICI 118, 551 or HIF1α inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol could significantly inhibit
the pancreatic cancer growth and angiogenesis induced
by chronic stress, which suggested a novel β2-AR-HIF-1α
regulatory axis for stress-induced pancreatic tumor
growth and angiogenesis [25]. Moreover, activation of
β-AR receptor could up-regulate levels of HIF-1α and
downstream target genes independently of oxygen level
in pancreatic cancer cells [26].
In this study, we focus on elucidating the role
of HIF-1α and β2-AR signaling in NNK induced
proliferation and invasion processes in vitro and in
vivo. We show that NNK increases pancreatic cancer
proliferation and invasion in vitro and promote pancreatic
cancer growth in vivo. Knockdown of HIF-1α and
ICI118, 551 abolishes the above effects of NNK. And
CoCl2 increases ICI118, 551 suppressed pancreatic cancer
invasion and cyclin D1 and VEGF expression under
NNK exposure. Our data indicate that β2-AR signaling
mediates NNK-induced pancreatic cancer progression via
upregulation of HIF-1α.

was present in the membrane of most pancreatic cancer
cells. The representative staining results are shown in
Figure 1a and 1d. Varying HIF-1α expression and β2-AR
expression were observed between different histological
differentiation and among the tumor node metastasis
(TNM) stages (P < 0.05, respectively) (Table 1). The
median survival time of the HIF-1α-positive and HIF-1αnegative groups were 6.0 and 13.0 months, respectively
(P < 0.05) (Figure 1b). The median survival time of the
β2-AR-positive and β2-AR-negative groups were 6.0 and
12.0 months, respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 1e).
Moreover, the median survival time of the smoking
and non-smoking groups were 6.0 and 11.0 months,
respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 1c). Different HIF-1α
and β2-AR expression levels were observed between the
smoking and non-smoking groups (P < 0.05) (Table 1).

Establishment of stable HIF-1α knockdown
To study the long-term growth pattern of tumor cells
in vitro, we successfully generated stable shRNA vectortransfected cells termed sh-HIF-1α No.1, sh-HIF-1α No.2
and sh-NC (negative control vector). qRT-PCR analysis
showed that compared with sh-NC cells, the HIF-1α mRNA
expression was inhibited up to 70% in both MIA PaCa-2 and
BxPC-3 HIF-1α shRNA transfected cell lines under hypoxic
conditions, particularly in sh-HIF-1α No.2 cells (P < 0.05).
HIF-1α expression level in sh-NC cells was similar to that
of normal cells (Figure 2a). Moreover, the HIF-1α protein
level was also significantly downregulated in both MIA
PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 HIF-1α shRNA transfected cell lines
under hypoxic conditions (Figure 2b–2c).

NNK increases HIF-1α protein expression
in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro
Because different HIF-1α expression levels were
observed between the smoking and non-smoking groups,
we wanted to investigate the effect of NNK on the
expression of HIF-1α in vitro. As shown in Figure 2d–2f,
NNK markedly increased HIF-1α protein expression in
both MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells compared with the
control group. However, HIF-1α mRNA expression in
both MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells remained unchanged.
Moreover, knockdown of HIF-1α abolished the
effects of NNK on HIF-1α protein expression in both MIA
PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells (Figure 2e–2f). Intriguingly, β2AR antagonist (ICI 118, 551) also suppressed the HIF-1α
protein expression induced by NNK (Figure 2e–2f).

RESULTS
Association of HIF-1α and β2-AR expression
levels and smoking with pancreatic cancer
To explore the possible role of HIF-1α and β2-AR
in the triggering pancreatic cancer progression, we first
explored the expression of HIF-1α and β2-AR in pancreatic
cancer specimens. The immunohistochemistry staining
showed that HIF-1α expression was not detected in normal
pancreatic cells but was present in the cytoplasm of most
pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, β2-AR expression
was hardly expressed in normal pancreatic cells but

signaling. MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells were treated with
NNK. There was a marked increase in the invasive ability
of both NNK-treated cell lines (Figure 3a). Moreover,
we examined the effect of NNK on the cell cycle phase
distribution of MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells. We found
a decrease in the proportion of cells in G0-G1 phase
after treatment with NNK (Figure 3b), and an increase in
the proportion of cells in S phase. In addition, cyclin D1
markedly increased after cells were exposed to NNK (Figure
3c–3e). We investigated whether NNK could upregulate the
HIF-1α target genes. We found that expression of VEGF, a
HIF-1α target gene, significantly increased after cells were
treated with NNK, compared with VEGF expression in the
control group (Figure 3c–3e).
However, incubation with the β2-AR antagonist (ICI
118, 551) abolished the effects of NNK in both MIA PaCa-2
and BxPC-3 cells (Figure 3). These data indicate that enhanced

Next, we investigated whether HIF-1α contributes
to NNK-induced pancreatic cancer proliferation and
invasion. HIF-1α knockdown abrogates the effects of
NNK on pancreatic cancer proliferation and invasion
(Figure 3). Cyclin D1 and VEGF decreased significantly
in the NNK+sh-HIF-1α group compared with the NNK
group. Moreover, NNK treated MIAPaCa-2 and BxPC-3
cells were exposed to 150 μM CoCl2 to upregulate HIF-1α
expression, and then, both two cells were treated with ICI
118, 551. The data showed that CoCl2 reversed the ICI118,

knockdown BxPC-3 cells (sh-HIF-1α cells) and sh-NC cells
were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. We found
that NNK significantly increased tumor growth compared
with the control group. Knockdown of HIF-1α or the β2AR antagonist (ICI 118, 551) obviously restrained tumor
growth compared with the NNK group (Figure 5a and
5b). Similarly, NNK significantly increased tumor VEGF
expression. Additionally, abrogation of HIF-1α or ICI 118,
551 reversed the VEGF upregulation in vivo (Figure 5c–5e).

551 weakened invasion and significantly upregulated
HIF-1α, cyclin D1, and VEGF expression in both two cells
(Figure 4). Because the β2-AR receptor antagonist (ICI 118,
551) could suppress the HIF-1α protein expression and
pancreatic cancer invasion and proliferation induced by
NNK, all the results described above indicate that HIF-1α is
required for β2-AR signaling mediating the NNK-enhanced
pancreatic cancer invasion and proliferation in vitro.

cancer carcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study,
we showed that NNK enhanced pancreatic cancer
proliferation and invasion and the effect was abolished
by a β2-antagonist. Treatment with NNK also increased
the intracellular HIF-α level in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC3 cells. All these findings suggest that β2-ARs mediates
the mitogenic action of NNK via a functional signal
transduction pathway. While in vitro studies showed that
NNK can stimulate PDAC cells directly by binding as
an agonist to their β2-ARs [19, 23], the observed HIF-1α
response adds a novel aspect to the mechanisms of action
of this powerful tobacco carcinogen. These findings
are in accord with reports on the significant stimulating
effects of HIF-1α on the proliferation and metastasis of
adenocarcinoma of the PDAC [28, 29], stomach [30],
colon, prostate [31], and ovary [13, 14]. Accordingly, the
NNK-induced increase in HIF-1α may contribute to the
development of these cited tumors in smokers.
The findings described above clearly indicate
that β2-ARs play an important role in the progression
of smoking related pancreatic cancer. Our data suggest
that the activation of β2-ARs would functionally result in
increased cell proliferation, invasion accompanied with
the up-regulation of HIF-1α. We recently showed that a
HIF-1α-dependent β-AR signaling pathway mediated
chronic stress-induced pancreatic cancer growth [25].
These findings might partially explain the protective
effects of antioxidants in the treatment and prevention
of pancreatic cancer in which multiple extracellular
mitogenic signals have been reported to converge
downstream of HIF-1α [32, 33]. More noteworthy is
that treating MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells with the
β2-antagonist significantly downregulated the NNK
increased HIF-1α expression along with the concomitant
inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion, and HIF-1α
overexpression abolished β2-antagonist-induced effects on
pancreatic cancer. Our data indicate that β2-AR signaling
regulates NNK enhanced pancreatic cancer proliferation
and invasion via HIF-1α upregulation.
Smoking is a documented risk factor [34–36] and
smokers have a 2-fold risk of developing PDAC [37, 38].
In this study, we were able to show that the median
survival time of pancreatic cancer patients who are
smokers is much shorter than that of patients who are nonsmokers (6.0 and 11.0 months, respectively). Moreover,
pancreatic cancer cells in smokers express higher
levels of HIF-1α than in non-smokers, and high HIF-1α
expression is correlated with low degree of histological
differentiation and high TNM stages in human pancreatic
cancer. Previous studies have shown that high HIF-1α
mRNA expression had a significant impact on survival.
High HIF-1α expression had a sensitivity of 87.1% and a
specificity of 55.6% for the diagnosis short (<6 months)
versus long (6–60 months) survival [39]. The expression
of HIF-1α was correlated with tumor characteristics,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

microvascular density (MVD) and survival [40–42]. These
data indicate that smoking may impact pancreatic cancer
clinical outcomes through upregulation of HIF-1α. This
is a retrospective study, which bears some limitations.
The number of cases included may not be large enough,
and the follow-up period is relatively short. A further
prospective, randomized study is necessary to compare
smoking exposure in more cases with longer follow-up.
Activation of β-ARs has been reported to stimulate
pulmonary and colon cancer cell growth as well as
pancreatic carcinoma cell migration [19, 20, 25, 28, 43].
To date, there are at least three reports showing a negative
relationship between the use of β-blockers and cancer risk
[44–47]. In these studies, β-blockers rather than diuretics
or calcium channel blockers for cardiovascular diseases
reduced the cancer risk. High expression of β1- and
β2-ARs was found to be correlated with a low degree of
histological differentiation and high TNM stages in human
pancreatic cancer, further substantiating the role of β-ARs
in the carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer. These findings
along with our experimental data might shed new light
on the understanding of the carcinogenic mechanism in
smoking-related pancreatic cancer and possibly open up
new chemoprophylactic and therapeutic avenues for the
prevention and treatment of cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa2 and BxPC-3) were stored in the Department of
Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of
Xi’an Jiaotong University. The cells were cultured in
DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). To
stimulate MIA PaCa or BxPC-3 cells, 100 μM ICI 118,
551 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) or 100 μM
NNK (Chemsyn Science Laboratories, Lenexa, KS) was
added into the culture media.

Immunohistochemistry
Patients diagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
with R0 resection, age 50–70y were included. Samples
including 48 pancreatic carcinoma and 8 normal pancreas
specimens were obtained from the Department of
Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an
Jiaotong University. Immunohistochemical staining for
HIF-1α and β2-AR were performed using the SABC kit
(Maxim, Fuzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Primary antibody for HIF-1α (1:50) and β2-AR
(1:50) were obtained from Bioworld (St. Louis Park, MN,
USA) and incubation occurred overnight at 4°C. Smokers

are defined as patients who smoke cigarettes 20 pipe/day
and last for 10 years. Non-smoking is defined as patients
who never smoke. For the evaluation of protein expression,
the staining intensity was graded as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2
(medium), or 3 (strong). The extent of staining was graded as
0 (0%), 1 (1–10%), 2 (11–50%), 3 (51–80%) and 4 (>81%)
according to the percentage of positive staining area relative
to the total tumor area. The final immunohistochemical
staining score was obtained by multiplying the intensity
and the extent of staining [48]. In the survival analysis, 48
patients diagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with R0
resection. Among the total patients, 32 cases were detected
positive expression of HIF-1α by immunohistochemistry,
16 cases were detected negative expression of HIF-1α.
However, 3 cases were lost, 2 cases were from the positive
HIF-1α expression group, and 1 case was from the negative
HIF-1α expression group. Additionally, 29 patients were
smokers, and 19 patients were non-smokers. Among the
total 48 patients, the 3 cases were lost, 1 case a was smoker
and 2 cases were non-smokers.
Signed informed consents from all the patients were
obtained. The study protocol and consent forms were
approved by the relevant ethical committee of the First
Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Xi’an Jiaotong
University, China.

random hexamers, 0.25 μl of ExScript RTase, and 0.25
μl of RNase inhibitor in a total volume of 10 μl. The
reactions were performed at 42°C for 12 min, followed
by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase at 95°C for
2 min. The cDNA was stored at 20°C. qRT-PCR was
performed on an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
with the SYBR Green Master Mix. The final reaction
volume was 25 μl and contained 12.5 μl 2× SYBR
Premix Ex Taq, 1.0 μl of each primer (10 μM), 0.5 μl
50× ROX reference dye, and 1.0 μl cDNA. The cycling
conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for
10 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of denaturation
at 95°C for 5 sec, annealing at 60°C for 30 sec, and
extension at 72°C for 30 sec. A melting curve analysis
was applied to assess the specificity of the amplified
PCR products. Each measurement was performed
in triplicate, and no-template controls were included
for each assay. GAPDH was applied as the internal
housekeeping gene control. Relative gene expression
was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method [49]. The primers
for HIF-1α were 5′-AAGTCTAGGGATGCAGCA3′(forward) and 5′-CAAGATCACCAGCATCATG-3′
(backward). The primers for GAPDH were
5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and
5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGAT-3′ (backward).

HIF-1α shRNA lentivirus transfection
HIF-1α shRNA (shHIF-1α) and negative control
shRNA (shNC) in eukaryotic GV248 lentiviral vectors
were purchased from GeneChem Co., Ltd (Shanghai,
China). The target sequence for HIF-1α shRNA was
CCACCACUGAUGAAUUAAATT. Cells were seeded
at 1 × 103 cells/well into 96-well plates 24 h prior to
transfection. When cells grew to 30–70% confluence,
transfection was carried out by using lentiviral particles
(MIA PaCa MOI = 20; BxPC-3 MOI = 10), polybrene
(5 μg/ml) and ENi.S according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. 12 h post-transfection, virus-containing
medium was replaced with complete medium. 96 h posttransfection, all cells were selected by puromycin (Merck,
USA) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml (MIA PaCa-2) or
4 μg/ml (BxPC-3) for 10 days. Then, cells were maintained
in 2.5 μg/ml (MIA PaCa-2) or 2 μg/ml (BxPC-3) of
puromycin. For generation of stable transfected cells, a
hundred transfected cells were seeded into a 10 cm2 petri
dish and media was changed three times a week. After
3 weeks, puromycin resistant colonies were isolated and
seeded into 96-well plates for further study.

Flow cytometric analysis
Before flow cytometric analysis, 1 × 106 cells were
collected, washed two times with PBS, and fixed with
ice-cold 70% ethanol for 24 h at 4°C. The fixed cells
were stained with propidium iodide (Beckman Coulter,
Miami FL, USA). After incubation for 30 min at 37°C,
the samples were analyzed by Flow Cytometry. Cell cycle
analysis of DNA histograms was performed with the
MultiCycle software.

Protein extraction and Western blot assay
MIA PaCa or BxPC-3 cells (1 × 106) grown under
our experimental conditions were lysed for 20 min on ice
in 300 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Total
proteins (100 μg) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels,
separated, and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Roche,
Penzberg, Germany). The membranes were blocked with
5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and were subsequently
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)
To extract total RNA, 2 × 105 cells were harvested
with the Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). cDNA synthesis was conducted as follows with

five washes of 10 min each in TBST, the membranes
were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 2 h and subsequently washed again. The
peroxidase reaction was performed using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system to visualize the
immunoreactive bands. The density of specific protein
bands were determined by Image-Pro Plus 5.0 software
(Media Cybernetics, Inc. Rockville, MD, USA).

flank of nude mice. A total of five mice per group were
used. Starting 24 hours after tumor cell injection, a
5 mg/kg/dose of ICI 118, 551 or PBS was i.p. injected
into the mice every day, and NNK was i.p. injected into
the mice three times a week for 8 weeks (50 mg/kg). All
treatments were administered in a total volume of 200 μl.
After 56 days, animals were sacrificed and the s.c. tumors
were isolated. Tumors were fixed in formalin as soon as
possible and embedded in paraffin. Tumor volume was
calculated as (length/2) × (width2). Tumor samples were
analyzed using H&E staining. Representative images
were taken from each tumor using a light microscope at
× 200 magnification.

Matrigel invasion assay
A chamber-based invasion assay (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) was performed to evaluate pancreatic
cancer cell invasion. Briefly, the upper surface of the
membrane was coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). MIA PaCa or BxPC-3 cells
(1 × 105) were resuspended in the upper chamber in
serum-free medium and allowed to migrate toward a
serum gradient (10%) in the lower chamber for 24 h. The
media was aspirated from the inside of the insert, and the
non-invasive cells on the upper side were removed by
scraping with a cotton swab. The membrane was fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal
violet. The number of migrating cells was counted on each
membrane in 10 random fields and photographed at × 100
magnification. The values reported here are the averages
of triplicate experiments.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the
SPSS13.0 software. The results were presented as the
means ± standard deviations (SD) of three replicate
assays. Differences between the groups were assessed
by Student’s t-test or one way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). P < 
0.05 was considered as statistical
significance.
