Abstract
The cooked meat–derived heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3methylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is activated by CYP1A2
to the N-hydroxy metabolite, then esterified by acetyl
transferase and sulfur transferase into unstable DNA-reactive
products that can lead to mutation. The genotoxicity of PhIP
has been implicated in its carcinogenicity. Yet, CYP1A2-null
mice are still prone to PhIP-mediated cancer, inferring that
alternative mechanisms must be operative in tumor induction. PhIP induces tumors of the breast, prostate, and colon in
rats and lymphoma in mice. This profile of carcinogenicity is
indicative of hormonal involvement. We recently reported that
PhIP has potent estrogenic activity inducing transcription of
estrogen (E2)-regulated genes, proliferation of E2-dependent
cells, up-regulation of progesterone receptor, and stimulation
of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. In this report,
we show for the first time that PhIP at doses as low as of 10 11
mol/L has direct effects on a rat pituitary lactotroph model
(GH3 cells) and is able to induce cell proliferation and the
synthesis and secretion of prolactin. This PhIP-induced
pituitary cell proliferation and synthesis and secretion of
prolactin can be attenuated by an estrogen receptor (ER)
inhibitor, implying that PhIP effects on lactotroph responses
are ERA mediated. In view of the strong association between
estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and breast cancer, the PhIP
repertoire of hormone-like activities provides further mechanistic support for the tissue-specific carcinogenicity of the
chemical. Furthermore, the recent epidemiology studies that
report an association between consumption of cooked red
meat and premenopausal and postmenopausal human breast
cancer are consonant with these observations. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The major group of heterocyclic amines found in cooked meats
have been identified as compounds with a quinoline, quinoxaline,
or pyridine moiety. An important member of this group, 2-amino-1methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), is the most abundant mutagen in cooked beef by mass and is reported to be
responsible for f20% of the total mutagenicity found in fried beef
(1). PhIP has been detected in a variety of cooked meat and fish
products (1, 2). Thus, humans are exposed to PhIP frequently

through diet and lifestyle, and daily intake of PhIP among
Americans has been estimated to be around 280 to 460 ng/d per
person (3).
PhIP is mutagenic in a variety of bacterial and mammalian
toxicity assays (4) and is carcinogenic in the rat colon, mammary
gland, and prostate (5, 6). PhIP also induces a high incidence of
lymphoma in mice (7). Additionally, transplacental and transbreast milk exposure to PhIP has also been shown to increase the
risk of mammary tumors (8).
Whereas the genotoxicity of high-dose activated PhIP has been
characterized comprehensively, the mechanisms of its actions are
not as well understood at a cellular level, and little is known about
the effects exerted at concentrations of the compound that are
systemic after consumption of a cooked meat meal. It is widely
accepted that the formation of PhIP-DNA adducts, which lead to
mutations in critical genes, is central to the role of PhIP as a
carcinogen (9). The mechanistic basis of this is thought to be the
CYP1-mediated oxidation to the N-hydroxy derivative (primarily
catalyzed by CYP1A2; ref. 10) and then the esterification resulting
in an unstable product that generates a nitrenium ion that attacks
and adducts to guanine in DNA (11, 12). Yet treatment of CYP1A2null mice with PhIP still results in carcinogenesis (13), probably via
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 oxidative activation of the compound (14).
Clearly, factors other than just CYP1A2-mediated DNA adduction
are important in explaining the tumorigenicity of PhIP (12, 13).
Indeed, PhIP-DNA adducts are widely distributed across various
tissues and organs, but adduct levels do not correlate with
outcome in terms of carcinogenic response.
PhIP has several other effects on the mammary gland, in
addition to DNA adduct formation, which may be relevant to its
mechanisms of carcinogenesis. These include effects on mammary
gland development and proliferation, alterations in levels of
circulating hormones, and changes in cell signaling and gene
expression (15). These properties indicate that PhIP might act as a
tumor promoter in the mammary gland. In support of this, we have
recently reported that PhIP has potent estrogenic activity mediated
through the estrogen receptor a (ERa; ref. 16). From a mechanistic
viewpoint, clarification of the promotional potential of PhIP is
important for assessing risk to humans. Given the unique targettissue profile of PhIP and the fact that organ specificity is thought
to be largely dependent on promotional effects (17), it is probable
that, like E2, PhIP may be a promoter of cancer as well as an
initiator.
The pituitary lactotroph is a well-established target for estrogens. The primary function of the cell is to synthesize and secrete
prolactin (PRL), a hormone that exerts a wide range of physiologic
effects in mammals, including stimulation of mammary gland
development and lactation, hair maturation, synergism with
androgen in male sex accessory growth, and maintenance and
secretion of the corpus luteum. The potential role of PRL in human

Cells were treated with 10 8 mol/L E2 or 10 6 to 10 11 mol/L PhIP for 24 h

breast cancer has recently been reviewed by Harvey (18), who
reported that hyperprolactinaemia is consistently associated with
human breast cancer growth, development, and poor prognosis,
and agents that induce PRL-associated mammary carcinogenesis
may pose a risk to humans. Studies have shown that E2 controls the
expression of PRL in pituitary lactotrophs primarily by a
transcription-dependent mechanism mediated through the ER (19).
Whereas great efforts have been expended to characterize the
effects of xenoestrogens in recent years, many studies neglect the
potential effect of these compounds on the neuroendocrine axis. In
this investigation, we have examined the effects of PhIP on PRL
release using a rat somatolactotroph cell line to understand the
range of biological responses attributable to exposure to PhIP.

GH3 rat pituitary lactotroph cells were obtained from the European
Collection of Cell Cultures. Ham’s F10 Nutrient Mixture, 17h-estradiol, and
PD98059 were purchased from Sigma. Horse serum, FCS, L-glutamine, and
penicillin-streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. Phenol red–free
Ham’s F-10 Nutrient Mixture was purchased from Autogen Bioclear. PhIP
was purchased from Toronto Chemicals, Inc. ICI 182,780 was obtained from
Astra Zeneca. Poly-D-lysine–coated tissue culture flasks and plates were
purchased from Becton Dickinson. SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate was purchased from Pierce Biotechnology. Goat polyclonal
anti-PRL antibody (C-17) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS) was prepared as
previously described (16). Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose membrane and rat PRL (rPRL) enzyme immunoassay system were
purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were
purchased from Merck-BDH and were of AnaLar grade.
GH3 cell culture. Cells were maintained in culture in Ham’s F10
Nutrient Mixture supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. The
flasks used to propagate the cells were poly-D-lysine–coated 75-cm2 flasks.
For routine maintenance, cells were seeded at 4  104/cm2.
For experiments, subconfluent GH3 cells were trypsinized and seeded at
a density of 7.5  105 per well in poly-D-lysine–coated six-well plates and
allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, cells were washed twice
with PBS and the growth medium was replaced with 2 mL of experimental
medium consisting of phenol red–free Ham’s F-10 Nutrient Mixture
supplemented with 5% dextran–coated charcoal-stripped FBS, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Cells
were treated with 10 7 mol/L ICI 182,780 for 3 days to eliminate
endogenous estrogenic activity present in the serum used to propagate
the cell line. After this period, cells were washed twice with PBS and
replaced with fresh experimental medium for 1 day before treatment with
compounds.
Cell treatment. Stock solutions of E2, PhIP, ICI 182,780, and PD98059
(2¶-amino-3¶-methoxyflavone) were prepared in ethanol. PD98059 is a
selective and cell-permeable inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) kinase (MEK) that acts by inhibiting the activation of MAPK and
subsequent phosphorylation of MAPK substrates. All compounds were
diluted 1:1,000 in experimental medium to give the desired final
concentration. Ethanol was added to control wells to produce the same
final solvent concentration (0.2%) in all wells.
Cell cultures were treated in triplicate with 10 8 mol/L E2 and
concentrations of PhIP ranging from 10 11 to 10 6 mol/L, in the presence
or absence of ICI 182,780 or PD98059 for 24 h. Seventy-two hours later, the
culture medium was collected and centrifuged to pellet cellular debris. The
supernatant was then aliquoted into tubes and stored at 20jC until
analysis.
Immunoblotting. Lysates were prepared from GH3 cells treated for
24 h with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L sodium fluoride, and 50 Ag/mL
leupeptin] and incubated at 4jC for 15 min, and 15 Ag of each protein
sample were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins in
the gel were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in transfer
buffer [192 mmol/L glycine, 25 mmol/L Tris base, and 20% (v/v) methanol,
pH 8.3]. Nonspecific binding sites on the membranes were blocked by

equivalent amount of ethanol vehicle (0.2%). After 48 h, the compounds
were washed off and fresh medium was added; the cells were cultured for a

Figure 3. Effects of the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 and the MEK inhibitor
PD98059 on E2- and PhIP-induced PRL secretion. GH3 cells were treated
with 10 8 mol/L E2 or 10 7 mol/L PhIP in the presence of the antiestrogen
ICI 182,780 (10 7 mol/L) or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (5  10 6 mol/L) for 72 h.
The amount of PRL secreted into the medium was measured using a rPRL

incubation of the membranes in blocking buffer (5% nonfat powdered milk,
0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were
incubated with goat polyclonal anti-PRL antibody (dilution, 1:500) overnight
at 4jC in blocking buffer. The following day, unbound antibody was
removed by washing the membrane in PBST (PBS containing 0.5% Tween
20) for 3  10 min. After washing, membranes were incubated in
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antigoat antibody (1:10,000 dilution in
blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed
again and target protein bands were visualized using SuperSignal
chemiluminescent reagent.
rPRL enzyme immunoassay. Secreted rPRL was analyzed in GH3
culture medium with a rPRL enzyme immunoassay system. This assay is
based on the competition between unlabeled rPRL and a fixed quantity of
biotin-labeled rPRL for a limited amount of rPRL-specific antibody. The
labeled ligand that is bound to the antibody is immobilized on precoated
microtitre wells. After washing, Amdex amplification reagent is added.
Briefly, 50 AL of each sample and 50 AL of goat anti-rPRL were pipetted into
wells of a microtitre plate precoated with donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin
G. The plate was left to incubate at room temperature for 3 h and then
50 AL of rPRL conjugate were added to each well. The plate was incubated
at room temperature for 30 min, after which the wells were washed four
times with wash buffer [0.01 mol/L PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Tween 20
and 0.01% thiomerosal]. The wells were then filled with 100 AL of Amdex
amplification reagent and allowed to incubate at room temperature for
30 min. Amdex reagent is a conjugate based on chemistry that uses a
hydrophilic straight-chain dextran backbone to which many hundreds of
horseradish peroxidase molecules are covalently coupled with 10 streptavidin molecules. The washing steps were then repeated and 100 AL of TMB
substrate [3,3¶,5,5¶-tetramethylbenzidine/hydrogen peroxide solution in 20%
(v/v) dimethylformamide] were added to each well. The plate was incubated
at room temperature for 30 min, after which 100 AL of 1 mol/L sulfuric acid
were pipetted into the wells to terminate the reaction. The absorbance of
the wells was then determined by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm on a
microplate reader. ANOVA was used to determine the statistical difference
in PRL secreted for each treatment versus vehicle-treated control.
Cell proliferation assay. GH3 cells were plated into 24-well plates at a
density of 5  104 per well and grown for 3 days in medium containing
10 7 mol/L ICI 182,780 to eliminate estrogenic activity present in the serum.
Cells were then washed twice with PBS and cultured in fresh experimental
medium for 1 day before treatment with E2 (10 9 or 10 11 mol/L) or
PhIP (10 6–10 11 mol/L) in the presence or absence of ICI 182,780

Effect of PhIP on PRL release from GH3 cells. When GH3 cells
are maintained under conditions of low estrogen concentrations,
exogenous estrogens increase the synthesis of PRL and its release,
and therefore these cells are widely used as an in vitro lactotroph
model. E2 has been shown to regulate pituitary function by
increasing the synthesis and secretion of PRL. To examine the
effect of PhIP on the secretion of PRL, a rPRL immunoassay was
done on medium obtained from GH3 cells incubated with various
concentrations of PhIP (10 11–10 6 mol/L). Treatment with PhIP
for 24 or 72 h resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PRL
secretion into the medium (Fig. 1). After 72 h, maximal stimulation
was achieved at 10 6 mol/L PhIP, which gave 57% of the response
elicited by E2 at 10 8 mol/L. PhIP significantly stimulated PRL
secretion over the entire dose range examined (10 11–10 6 mol/L).
The temporal effect of PhIP treatment on PRL release was also
examined by immunoblot of aliquots of conditioned medium
removed from treated GH3 cultures. Maximal induction of PRL was
observed at 48 h posttreatment (Fig. 2).
Effects of ICI 182,780 and PD98059 on PhIP-stimulated PRL
release. To determine if the increase in PRL secretion was mediated
by PhIP/ER binding, PRL secretion was measured in the presence
of the antiestrogen ICI 182,780. Treatment of GH3 cells with
10 7 mol/L PhIP in the presence of an equimolar concentration of

Figure 5. Effect of PhIP on GH3 cell proliferation. GH3 cells were treated with
10 11 mol/L E2 or various concentrations of PhIP for 48 h, after which they
were washed with PBS and left to grow for a further 5 d. Columns, mean of
triplicate wells; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, versus vehicle control; **, P < 0.01, versus

ICI 182,780 resulted in a total inhibition of PhIP-induced PRL
secretion (Fig. 3). The release of PRL stimulated by E2 was also
significantly inhibited by concurrent treatment with ICI 182,780
albeit to a lesser extent than PhIP, implying a role for ER in the
observed activity.
Watters et al. (20) reported that E2-induced PRL expression
requires an intact MAPK signal transduction pathway in GH3 cells.
For this reason, the effect of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 on the
activity of PhIP was also investigated. Treatment of cells with
PD98059 completely abrogated the PRL-stimulating effects of both
E2 and PhIP (Fig. 3).
Induction of intracellular PRL expression by PhIP. Intracellular PRL was analyzed by immunoblotting of lysates of GH3 cells
treated for 24 h. Both E2 and PhIP increased the intracellular levels
of PRL (Fig. 4). PRL resolved as two bands at f23 and 25 kDa. The
lower band on the blot is unmodified PRL, whereas the upper band
represents the phosphorylated form of the hormone. Unmodified
and phosphorylated PRL together constitute 90% to 98% of the PRL
produced by the rodent pituitary.
Administration of ICI 182,780 reduced PRL accumulation in the
intracellular pools, indicating that the effects of the antiestrogen
are not solely on PhIP-induced PRL secretion in these cells.
Effect of PhIP on GH3 cell proliferation. Both E2 and PhIP
stimulated the proliferation of GH3 cells grown in low-estrogen
conditions (Fig. 5). E2 (10 11 mol/L) had a 30% proliferative
potency over vehicle treatment after the 5-day growth period,
showing the estrogen responsiveness of this cell line. PhIP induced
a proliferative response in GH3 cells only at the lower doses used
(i.e., at 10 9–10 11 mol/L). PhIP exhibited a maximal proliferative
response at 10 10 mol/L, suggesting that the proliferative response
of GH3 cells is more sensitive to PhIP than the PRL secretion
response observed at the higher doses.

Discussion
The role of PRL in breast cancer. The data reported here show
for the first time that PhIP is able to directly stimulate the
proliferation of a rat pituitary lactotroph model (GH3 cells) and to
induce the synthesis and secretion of the hormone PRL. PRL plays
a key role in the normal growth, differentiation, and development
of the mammary gland. There is evidence to suggest that

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

development of the alveolar cells in the breast requires not only
E2 and progesterone but also PRL. Indeed, mice in which the PRL
gene has been deleted have impaired mammary gland development
and fail to lactate after their first pregnancy (21). Rodent model
systems have also illustrated a direct role for PRL in the
development of breast cancer (22–24).
The role of PRL in the etiology of human breast cancer is less
clear. Biswas and Vonderhaar (25) have shown that more than 80%
of human breast cancer cell lines express the PRL receptor, bind
PRL with high affinity, and proliferate in response to PRL.
Furthermore, serum PRL levels are significantly elevated in women
at risk for familial breast cancer, and hyperprolactinaemia is
considered to be an indicator of unfavorable prognosis in breast
cancer patients and has been associated with metastases, early
disease relapse, and poor overall survival (26).
PRL expression. PRL expression is subject to a complex and
multihormonal regulation, which includes the stimulatory effects
of estradiol (E2), thyrotropin-releasing hormone, epidermal growth
factor, and the inhibitory influence of dopamine. By a transcription-dependent mechanism, E2 increases PRL gene expression,
synthesis, storage, and release, as well as stimulates lactotroph
proliferation (19, 27). E2 acts by binding to nuclear ERs that, in
turn, interact with specific estrogen response elements present in
the promoter sequences of target genes to modulate their
expression. The ERs stimulate transcription by recruiting coactivator complexes with histone acetylator and methylase
activities (28). In the PRL gene, the E2-ER complex interacts
directly with an imperfect palindromic estrogen response element
in the 5¶ flanking region f1.8 to 1.5 kb upstream from the
transcription initiation site of PRL mRNA (29).
PhIP induces PRL expression. We have previously reported the
powerful E2-like activity of the cooked meat–derived carcinogen
PhIP (16), which was subsequently confirmed by others (30). We
showed that PhIP binding to ERa leads to transcriptional
activation of E2-responsive genes. PhIP can also mediate proliferation of cells that are E2 growth dependent and can activate E2responsive signal transduction (12, 16). Given the involvement of
PRL in breast cancer and the fact that expression of this hormone
is under the control of E2, evaluation of the ability of PhIP to
stimulate the secretion of PRL is important. The presence of
binding sites for Pit-1, a pituitary-specific transcription factor, is
mandatory for E2 induction of the PRL promoter (31); hence, we
used the GH3 rat pituitary cell line (which possesses an
endogenous Pit-1 site) in the present investigation. We show here
that nanomolar concentrations of PhIP increased both the
synthesis and secretion of PRL in GH3 cells in a dose-dependent
manner, with a significant effect even at 10 11 mol/L. Watters et al.
(20) showed that E2 modulation of PRL gene expression requires an
intact MAPK pathway in GH3 cells. The results from the present
study are in good agreement with this because the effects of both
E2 and PhIP were completely abolished by the administration of
the MEK inhibitor PD98059.
Although PhIP has only about a third of the potency of E2 in
terms of PRL-stimulating activity, it is possible that it may act in
concert with endogenous hormones or, indeed, other xenoestrogens to exert detrimental effects in the body. For example,
combinations of two weak xenoestrogens can be 100 to 1,000
times as potent in eliciting an estrogenic response as each
substance alone (32). PhIP and other xenoestrogens may therefore
constitute an unsuspected source of compounds capable of
altering the natural hormonal balance.

PhIP Has Potent Hormone-like Activity

PhIP-DNA adducts have been identified in the brains of both rats
and monkeys treated with PhIP (33), confirming that PhIP and/or
its metabolites are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and can
therefore presumably act directly on pituitary cells to mediate PRL
secretion. More significantly, the PRL-stimulating effect of PhIP has
previously been reported in an in vivo study examining the
inhibitory effects of PhIP on mammary gland involution in
Sprague-Dawley rats (34). The authors showed that PhIP increased
serum levels of PRL f1.3-fold over that of vehicle-treated control
animals. The mechanism involved was suggested to be associated
with the inhibitory action of PhIP on 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine
amino acid decarboxylase, an enzyme involved in the production of
dopamine and is a negative regulator of PRL in the hypothalamus.
We suggest that an interaction of PhIP with ER offers an alternative
explanation.
PhIP induces cell proliferation. GH3 cells are responsive to the
mitogenic signal of E2; in this system, PhIP also induced a proliferative
response in GH3 cells, but only at 10 9 to 10 11 mol/L. The
observation that PhIP induces maximal growth at these low
concentrations is consistent with the findings of Amara and Dannies
(27), who reported that concentrations of E2 higher than 10 11 mol/L
decreased cell growth. A maximal proliferative response was seen with
PhIP at 10 10 mol/L whereas the PRL-stimulating effect increased with
dose. This indicates that GH3 cells are differentially responsive to PhIP
in terms of growth and PRL expression, an effect also described for
E2 by Chun et al. (35), who found that the proliferative response to E2
in the PR1 pituitary cell line is much more sensitive than the PRL
response. A possible explanation for the observation that PhIP stimulates GH3 cell growth at lower concentrations than it stimulates PRL
secretion may be that the ER-mediated proliferation response is not
functionally linked to the ER-mediated PRL gene expression. Alternatively, perhaps only a small pool of ERs is required for cell proliferation in contrast with the regulation of expression for specific genes.
The mitogenic effects of PRL involve binding to the PRL
receptor, receptor dimerization, and phosphorylation of Janusactivated kinase 1 (Jak2), a member of the Janus family of kinases,
which is constitutively associated with the receptor. Jak2
reciprocally phosphorylates the PRL receptor and cytoplasmic
transcription factors of the signal transducer and activator of
transcription (Stat) family (36). Activation of Stat proteins results
in translocation to the nucleus, where they bind specific DNA
promoter elements to regulate gene transcription. The major Stat
protein activated by PRL in the mammary gland, Stat5A, is
primarily associated with milk production and cell cycle progression and regulates proteins such as h-casein, h-lactoglobulin, and
cyclin D1 (37). Consistent with such an interaction, Shan et al. (38)
recently showed that PhIP elevates the level of phosphorylated
Stat5 in HC-11 mouse mammary epithelial cells and can alter the
expression of genes regulated by PRL in these cells. This activity
could be inhibited by the Jak2-specific inhibitor AG490. Activation
of the Jak-Stat pathway is associated with the development of

breast cancers and lymphomas, among other diseases. Intriguingly,
these are the same cancers that have been linked to PhIP,
specifically breast cancer in rats (5) and lymphomas in mice (7).
Therefore, PhIP stimulation of PRL secretion may be related to its
ability to cause cancers at these sites.
In addition to being implicated in the etiology of breast cancer
and lymphomas, there is a wide body of evidence to suggest that
PRL may be involved in the development of prostate cancer.
Studies in vivo have consistently shown that hyperprolactinaemia
stimulates proliferation in the rat prostate (39). Using a transgenic
mouse model, Wennbo et al. (40) showed that mice overexpressing
PRL had a 20-fold increase in prostate weight compared with
control animals. PRL receptors are expressed in the human
prostate, and expression is especially elevated in precancerous
lesions (41). Plasma PRL increases at puberty and continues to
increase in parallel with the age-related increase seen in the
incidence of prostate cancer. The involvement of PRL in prostate
cancer is interesting in view of the fact that the prostate is another
target site of PhIP carcinogenicity (6).
The metabolism of PhIP in mammals is now well understood
and the genotoxic potential of PhIP and its metabolites is well
characterized. In assessing the carcinogenic properties of PhIP,
metabolic activation into DNA-damaging species has been a
significant consideration. The present study does not lessen the
importance of metabolism in PhIP carcinogenicity but does
emphasize that the additional biological properties of the molecule
and its metabolites could influence the site specificity of its
carcinogenicity.
In summary, it has been shown that concentrations of PhIP that
approximate those expected to be circulating after consumption of
a cooked meat meal (12) are able to stimulate the growth of
pituitary cells and the synthesis and secretion of PRL in those cells.
These effects are consistent with the reported stimulation of PRL
by PhIP in vivo in rats (34). Together with previous reports that
describe the potent estrogenicity of PhIP and its ability to influence
progesterone receptor expression, c-Myc expression, and MAPK
signal transduction pathway (16, 30), the present findings provide
clues about the mechanisms involved in the tissue-specific
carcinogenicity of PhIP and, in particular, mammary carcinogenesis. In connection with this, it is pertinent to note the very recent
epidemiology studies that report an association between consumption of cooked red meat and both premenopausal and
postmenopausal human breast cancer (42–44).
