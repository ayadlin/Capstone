Abstract
Endocrine resistance is a major challenge in the management of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers.
Although multiple mechanisms leading to endocrine resistance have been proposed, the poor outcome of patients
developing resistance to endocrine therapy warrants additional studies. Here we show that noncanonical
Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is an alternative growth promoting mechanism that is activated in tamoxifen-resistant
tumors. Importantly, phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway plays a key role
in regulating Hh signaling by protecting key components of this pathway from proteasomal degradation. The
levels of Hh-signaling molecules SMO and GLI1 and the targets were signiﬁcantly elevated in tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 cells and T47D cells. Serial passage of the resistant cells in mice resulted in aggressive tumors that
metastasized to distant organs with concurrent increases in Hh marker expression and epithelial mesenchymal
transition. RNAi-mediated depletion of SMO or GLI1 in the resistant cells resulted in reduced proliferation,
clonogenic survival and delayed G1–S transition. Notably, treatment of resistant cells with PI3K inhibitors
decreased SMO and GLI1 protein levels and activity that was rescued upon blocking GSK3b and proteasomal
degradation. Furthermore, treatment of tamoxifen-resistant xenografts with anti-Hh compound GDC-0449
blocked tumor growth in mice. Importantly, high GLI1 expression correlated inversely with disease-free and
overall survival in a cohort of 315 patients with breast cancer. In summary, our results describe a signaling event
linking PI3K/AKT pathway with Hh signaling that promotes tamoxifen resistance. Targeting Hh pathway alone or
in combination with PI3K/AKT pathway could therefore be a novel therapeutic option in treating endocrineresistant breast cancer. Cancer Res; 72(19); 5048–59. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related
death in women globally. Death rates from breast cancer have
been steadily decreasing since 1990, which is attributed largely
to better screening methods and improved treatment options.
Perhaps, the major breakthrough in the treatment of breast
cancer was the development of targeted therapies with drugs
such as tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator that blocks estrogen signaling. This therapeutic approach
has been successfully used to treat approximately two-thirds of

ER-positive breast cancers resulting in 50% improvement in
disease-free survival (1). A recurring problem is, however, the
development of acquired resistance to ER-targeted therapies
in about 30% to 40% of the woman treated with tamoxifen for 5
years. Several signaling pathways are implicated in tamoxifen
resistance including PI3K/mTOR/Akt, HER2/ERB, and insulinlike growth factor receptor (IGF-R) pathways (2–6). A few
agents targeting these pathways in hormone-refractory breast
cancers are in clinical trials (5, 7). To date, however, there is no
approved targeted therapy to improve outcomes in hormonerefractory breast cancers without resorting to chemotherapy.
The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is highly conserved
and plays a crucial role in vertebrate embryogenesis (8). The
Hh ligands (SHH, IHH, and DHH) bind to the cell surface
receptor Patched (PTCH), which otherwise inhibits the activity
of the transmembrane receptor like protein Smoothened
(SMO). Release of SMO from PTCH-mediated repression
results in posttranslational processing of the GLI (gliomaassociated oncogene homolog)–zinc-ﬁnger transcription factors. Three mammalian GLI proteins are known to exist out of
which GLI1 and GLI2 usually act as transcriptional activators
and GLI3 acts as a transcriptional repressor (9). Aberrant
activation of the Hh pathway has been reported in several
cancers including basal cell carcinomas, medulloblastomas,

Hedgehog Signaling in Tamoxifen-Resistant Breast Cancer

pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and glioblastomas (10–12). Several lines of evidence point toward involvement of Hh signaling
in breast carcinogenesis, and hence provide an attractive,
rational therapeutic target in treating this cancer (13).
Mice with heterozygous disruption of Ptch1 showed marked
abnormalities in mammary glands resembling ductal dysplasias
and hyperplasias (14). Further, expression of activated human
SMO (SmoM2) in mouse mammary epithelium led to increased
proliferation, altered differentiation, and ductal dysplasias
distinct from those caused by Ptch1 heterozygosity (15). Hh
signaling is also activated in human mammary stem/progenitor
cells and is downregulated upon cell differentiation (16). It may
also play a part in breast cancer progression through its role in
communication between epithelial and stromal compartments
(17, 18). Furthermore, higher expression of SHH in breast tumors
was signiﬁcantly associated with increased risk of metastasis
and breast cancer-speciﬁc death (19).
Here we present in vitro and in vivo data showing the
dependence of endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells on
activated Hh signaling for growth and the mechanism for this
activation. In addition, we also present data supporting the
clinical use of Hh inhibitors in endocrine-resistant tumors.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 and Wortmannin) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3; LiCl) were from Sigma. AKT
inhibitor [1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate] was from EMD Biosciences. GDC0449 was synthesized at the Pharmacology core facility of The
Ohio State University, following published protocol (20). MISSION siRNA universal negative Control and siRNA to SMO and
GLI1 were from Sigma.
Cell culture and tissue procurement
Tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cells and OHTR100 cells (resistant to 100 nmol/L tamoxifen) were obtained from Dr. Kenneth
P. Nephew (Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana) and
maintained as described (21). OHTR100 cells were further
cultured in 500 nmol/L 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT) for 1
month to obtain the OHTR500 cells, followed by exposure to
1,000 nmol/L tamoxifen to obtain the OHTR1000 cells. T47D
cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
and maintained as instructed. Cell lines were not passaged
longer than 6 months after receipt. Primary human breast
samples were obtained from the Stephanie Spielman Tissue
Bank (protocol 2003C0036).

sion was quantiﬁed by the ImageJ Software (http://rsbweb.nih.
gov/ij/).
Plasmids, transfections, and luciferase assay
Dr. Hiroshi Sasaki gifted a 8  30 Gli BS-d50 -Luc plasmid (9).
pLKO.1–shGLI1 plasmid was from Thermo Scientiﬁc. Cells
(1.6  105/well) seeded in a 24-well plate were transfected for
6 hours with 8  30 Gli-BS-d50 -Luc plasmid and pRLTK (internal
control, Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Assay System (Promega) after 48 hours of transfection.
OHTR2nd cells were routinely used to study the mechanism
of Hh pathway activation as this pathway is highly active in
these cells.
Cell proliferation assay
Cells (4,000/well) seeded in 96-well plates were serum starved
overnight and treated with 5 mmol/L tamoxifen for 72 hours.
Cell proliferation was monitored using a MTT assay kit (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals), following company's protocol.
Colony formation assay
The assay was conducted as described previously (23).
Brieﬂy, exponentially growing cells (500/well) in 6-well plates
were treated with indicated concentrations of tamoxifen for
2 weeks. When colonies were readily visible (>50 cells/colony)
they were ﬁxed in methanol and stained with 1% crystal violet
solution. The colony number was quantiﬁed using the AlphaView Software 3.1 (FluorChem Q).
Flow cytometric analysis
Trypsinized cells were ﬁxed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and
stored at 20 C. Before analysis, samples were washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with 5.0 mg/mL
propidium iodide in PBS containing 0.2 mg/mL RNaseA. The
single-cell suspensions were analyzed by a FACSCalibur (BD
Biosciences) using the Cell Quest Software, and cell-cycle
distribution was assessed using the ModFit program (Verity
Software House).

RT-PCR analysis
cDNA was synthesized from DNase-treated total RNA and
gene expression (SHH, SMO, GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3) was measured in quadruplicate using Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems). Expression of SNAIL, MYC, and BMI1 was measured
using Sybr Green chemistry.

Mouse mammary tumor induction and drug treatment
Cells (5  106) were grafted in mammary fat pads of ovariectomized Balb/c nude mice (Charles River Laboratory) with
subcutaneous (s.c) supplementation of 0.72 mg 17-b-estradiol
pellet (Innovative Research of America). When the tumor
reached approximately 100 mm3, the mice received 5 mg, 60day sustained release pellet of tamoxifen citrate (Innovative
Research of America) subcutaneously. Freshly formulated suspension of GDC-0449, in 0.5% methylcellulaose, 0.1% Tween-80
(24) was administered orally at 100 mg/kg body weight (25),
twice daily for 10 days. Length (L) and width (W) of the tumors
were measured twice a week, and tumor volume was calculated
using the formula pLW2/6, as previously described (26). At least 5
animals per group were used in each experiment.

Western blot analysis
Whole cell extracts were prepared in the cell lysis buffer,
followed by immunoblotting as described (22). Protein expres-

automated system (Ventana Medical Systems; ref. 27).
The positive and negative controls are expressing and nonexpressing tissues, respectively, with and without primary
antibody. Expressions of the markers were scored on the
basis of percentage-positive cells and intensity of the staining
by two independent pathologists. In case of discrepancy, an
independent reader was consulted and consensus was
obtained. A score of 10% or more was considered positive. All
clinical follow-up was derived from the James Tumor Registry,
OSU with a median follow-up of 96 months (0.93, 139.1
months).
Statistical analysis
The standard 2-tailed Student t-test was used for 2 data sets.
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni/Dunn posttests were used for
data sets with multiple groups using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc.). Two-sided P values of equal or less than 0.05
were deemed to be statistically signiﬁcant. Representative data
from 2 to 3 reproducible experiments are presented, where
error bars represent standard deviation (SD) or standard error
of the mean (SEM) in animal experiments. For patient data,
summary statistics were calculated to show patient characteristics. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association
between 2 categorical variables, such as 2 Hh markers expression levels (high vs. low for both). Staining score of 10% or more
was considered high as mentioned in the methodology section.
Survival analysis was conducted to assess the impact of Hh
marker expression and other known clinical prognostic factors
(age at diagnosis, tumor grade, breast cancer subtypes, and
nodal status) on disease-free and overall survival. Survival
curves were estimated by Kaplan–Meier plots for a dichotomized variable and compared by the log-rank test. Variables
with a P value less than 0.05 in the univariate Cox regression
analysis were further examined in multivariate Cox regression
models. Proportional hazard assumption was checked during
the modeling process. Upon signiﬁcant violation of the
assumption, stratiﬁed Cox models were utilized by including
the predictor as a stratiﬁcation factor. The covariate adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for the
Hh marker of interest was reported on the basis of the ﬁnal
model. The log-rank test was used to test the Hh marker's effect
on clinical outcome in patients with node positive and ER
positive breast cancer. All patient data analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1 statistical software (SAS institute Inc).

Results
Hedgehog signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in
tamoxifen-resistant cell lines
As a ﬁrst step to determine if Hh signaling pathway is
activated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, the expression of genes encoding Hh pathway components and their
protein levels were analyzed in tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines. The model cell lines used
for this study were tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cells and a panel
of MCF7 cells that are resistant to increasing concentration of
4-OHT (OHTR100, OHTR500, and OHTR1000; Supplementary
Fig. S1A). About 20% decrease in cell growth was observed
when the resistant cells were exposed to 2.5 and 5 mmol/L

tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. S1B), showing the resistance.
Real-time RT-PCR revealed a consistent increase in expression
of SHH, SMO, and GLI1 in the OHTR cell panel that correlated
with the level of tamoxifen resistance (Fig 1A), whereas GLI2
and GLI3 expression were not signiﬁcantly changed (data not
shown). There was no marked change in the amount of PTCH
RNA in OHTR cells (Fig. 1A). Western analysis of the Hh
signaling molecules conﬁrmed a marked increase in the protein levels of SMO and GLI1 in the resistant cells, whereas SHH
was not detected (Fig. 1B). The protein levels of PTCH (Fig. 1B),
GLI2, and GLI3 remain unaltered (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
It is known that T47D cells are relatively more resistant to
tamoxifen compared with other ER-positive cell lines (28).
Consistent with this ﬁnding, the level of SMO and GLI1
proteins were signiﬁcantly higher in the T47D cells compared
with tamoxifen-sensitive cell lines MCF7 and BT474 (Fig.1C). In
contrast, the expression of PTCH was comparable in all cell
lines.
Because GLI1 is a transcription factor, we tested the functional signiﬁcance of increased expression of this gene in the
tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant cells, using a GLI
responsive luciferase reporter vector (9). Analysis of luciferase
expression revealed a 6- to 7-fold increase in promoter activity
in the OHTR cells compared with the MCF7 cells (P < 0.001;
Fig. 1D), showing that transcriptional activity of GLI1 is
comparatively higher in the tamoxifen-resistant cells. Furthermore, depletion of GLI1 using GLI1-speciﬁc shRNA led to
about 65% (P < 0.01) decrease in GLI-driven promoter activity
(Fig. 1E).
We next analyzed the expression of the Hh target genes in
the MCF-7 and OHTR cell lines. The expression of SNAIL, BMI1,
and MYC mRNA in tamoxifen-resistant cells were signiﬁcantly
increased (2.5- to 4-fold; Fig. 1F). MYC and BMI1 protein levels
were also found to be markedly higher (5-fold and >17-fold,
respectively) in the tamoxifen-resistant cells, and directly
correlated with higher levels of tamoxifen resistance (Fig. 1G).
Tamoxifen-resistant xenografts in mouse mammary
gland undergo micro-metastasis with concurrent
increase in Hedgehog signaling
To study further the relationship between activated Hh
signaling and tamoxifen resistance of breast tumors in vivo,
tumor xenografts were established in Balb/c nude mice using
OHTR100 cells. The tumors were serially passaged in mice
treated with tamoxifen and a consistent increase in the growth
rate of the tumors was observed after each passage (Fig. 2A).
Microscopic analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E)
sections from the liver and lung of mice after the third passage
revealed metastatic lesions in both tissues, indicating that the
tamoxifen resistant cells acquired a more aggressive phenotype after in vivo passage (Fig. 2B). After each in vivo passage,
cells were isolated from the macro-dissected tumors and
cultured in vitro (OHTR1st, 2nd, and 3rd). Comparison of the
morphology of these cells revealed the acquisition of a more
mesenchymal phenotype in the OHTR3rd cells (Fig. 2C). Consistent with this ﬁnding, we observed increased expression of
vimentin, decreased expression of E-cadherin (Fig. 2D) and
increased mammosphere formation (Supplementary Fig. S2A

and B) in in vivo passaged cells. The expression of SMO and
GLI1 increased after successive passages and were signiﬁcantly
higher (3-fold) in the cells derived after the second and third
passage in the mice (Fig. 2E). Similar increases in expression of
the GLI1 target genes MYC were also observed (Fig.2E). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed a marked increase in SMO,
GLI1, and BMI1 in tamoxifen-resistant cells, with distinct
nuclear localization of GLI1 (Fig. 2F). These data showed a
strong relationship between acquisition of the aggressive
phenotype of tamoxifen-resistant cells in vivo and the activation of Hh signaling in the resistant tumors.

Knockdown of Hh pathway components inhibits growth
of tamoxifen-resistant cells
To determine the functional signiﬁcance of Hh pathway in
tamoxifen resistance, we depleted SMO and GLI1 from
OHTR2nd cells using the respective siRNA pools (Fig. 3A). A
60% decrease in SMO and 30% decrease in GLI1 protein level
was routinely observed in the siRNA-transfected cells (Fig 3A).
Comparison of cell proliferation to the scrambled siRNAtransfected control cells revealed a 66% (P < 0.001) and 25%
(P < 0.001) decrease in growth of SMO- and GLI1-depleted cells,
respectively. In the presence of 1.0 mmol/L tamoxifen, the

growth of SMO-depleted cells was further reduced by 25%
(P < 0.001) and that of GLI1-depleted cells by an additional 12%
(P < 0.05), whereas the growth of the control cells remained
unaffected (Fig. 3B). When assessed for clonogenic growth, we
observed a 30% (P < 0.001) decrease in colony formation upon
depletion of both SMO and GLI1. In the presence of 1.0 and 2.0
mmol/L tamoxifen, the colony formation was reduced by
approximately 50% (P < 0.001) and 85% (P < 0.01), respectively,
when SMO or GLI1 was depleted compared with the tamoxifen-treated control cells (Fig. 3C). Cell cycle analysis revealed
signiﬁcant retention of GLI1-depleted cells in the G1 phase
both in the absence (P < 0.001) and presence of tamoxifen
(P < 0.001) at 6 and 12 hours compared with the control cells
(Fig. 3D). There was no increase in the sub-G0 population or
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). Similar growth
suppression and sensitization to tamoxifen were also observed
in 2 independently derived GLI1 shRNA knockdown T47D
clones (Supplementary Fig. S3C–E). These clones showed
decreased growth in the presence of tamoxifen and, decreased
colony formation.

Analysis of target gene expression in SMO-depleted

marked reduction in the MYC protein (45%, Fig. 3E) and RNA
level in both the cell lines (OHTR: 60%, T47D: 63—75%, Fig. 3E
and Supplementary Fig. S3F). Further, the expression of BMI1
and SNAIL were also signiﬁcantly reduced in these cells (50%

GLI1-depleted OHTR cells (data not shown).
The PI3K/AKT pathway activates Hh signaling in
tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
To elucidate the mechanism underlying aberrant activation
of Hh pathway in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, we ﬁrst
used the GLI–luciferase reporter to determine whether a SHH
autocrine loop could account for pathway activation in resistant cell. While the GLI reporter was strongly activated in
OHTR2nd cells, addition of recombinant SHH ligand had no
effect on luciferase activity in OHTR2nd or MCF7 cells (Fig. 4A).
The data suggested that a noncanonical pathway might function to activate Hh signaling components and contribute to

tamoxifen resistance of these cells. To test this hypothesis,
OHTR2nd cells were routinely used to study the mechanism of
Hh pathway activation as this pathway is highly active in these
cells.
We hypothesized that the PI3K/AKT pathway, known to be
associated with poor patient outcome in endocrine-resistant
breast tumors (29, 30) is involved in Hh pathway activation.
Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment with 20 mmol/L
LY294002, a speciﬁc inhibitor of PI3K, resulted in a 50%

decrease in GLI-dependent luciferase activity in OHTR2nd cells,
but not in MCF7 cells (Fig. 4B). Similar inhibition of the GLIreporter was also observed when cells were treated with 500
nmol/L of Wortmanin (45%, P < 0.05) or 20 mmol/L of a speciﬁc
AKT inhibitor [1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-(R)-2-Omethyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate; 46%, P < 0.05; Supplementary

(Fig. 4F). A small but signiﬁcant increase in reporter activity
was also observed in MCF-7 cells forced to express constitutively active AKT (0.25-fold, P ¼ 0.045; Fig. 4F).
To explore a potential mechanism underlying the PI3K
pathway-activated Hh signaling, SMO and GLI1 protein levels
were measured in LY294002-treated OHTR2nd cells. These cells
showed approximately 50% decrease in SMO protein levels
compared with vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated
controls (Fig. 4G, left). A similar reduction in GLI1 level was
also observed after treatment with LY294002 (Fig. 4G, right).
GSK3b is a serine-threonine kinase that is negatively regulated by PI3K/AKT-mediated phosphorylation. We hypothesized that GSK3b-mediated phosphorylation of SMO and GLI1
facilitate ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of these proteins in breast tumor cells. Activation of
AKT in tamoxifen-resistant cells could thus rescue proteasomal degradation of these proteins by inhibiting GSK3b. Indeed,
bioinformatics analysis using GPS software (31) revealed the
presence of several potential phosphorylation motifs in SMO
(Supplementary Table S1) and in GLI1 (Supplementary Table
S2). To test this hypothesis, OHTR2nd cells were treated with
LiCl, a potent and speciﬁc inhibitor of GSK3b, alone or with
MG132 that inhibits proteasomal degradation. Western blot
analysis showed approximately a 2-fold increase in SMO and
GLI1 protein in the presence of LiCl or MG132 alone or in
combination (Fig. 4H). Furthermore, stabilization of SMO and
GLI1 by LiCl and MG132 was blocked when the cells were

treated simultaneously with the PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 4I and
Supplementary Fig. S4B).
These data showed that GSK3b-mediated phosphorylation
can indeed lead to proteasomal degradation of these two
proteins and that the PI3K/AKT pathway plays a key role in
stabilizing these signaling molecules thereby promoting activation of the Hh pathway in the resistant cells.
GDC-0449, a small molecule inhibitor of SMO inhibits
tamoxifen-resistant cell growth both in vitro and in vivo
GDC-0449, a small molecule inhibitor of SMO is in clinical
trials for several cancers with activated Hh pathway (http.
clinicaltrials.gov), including one in breast cancer. We used this
compound to determine if the growth of tamoxifen-resistant
cells could be suppressed with this inhibitor alone or in
combination with tamoxifen using both in vivo and in vitro
assays (Fig. 5A–D). For in vivo assays, xenografts were established in athymic nude mice with OHTR2nd cells. After
implanted tumors reached approximately 100 mm3 in size,
the mice were randomized in 4 groups: vehicle, tamoxifen
alone, GDC-0449 alone, and both tamoxifen and GDC-0449.
The mice were treated for 10 consecutive days and the tumor
growth was monitored for an additional 2 weeks (Fig. 5A).
While the control group tumor reached 500 mm3 in volume at
the endpoint of the assay, the GDC-0449-treated tumors failed
to grow. In fact, the tumors shrank by approximately 50% from
the day of treatment by day 24. Treatment with tamoxifen

alone caused a 2.5-fold reduction in tumor size compared with
the control group, whereas the combination of both tamoxifen
and GDC-0449 had no additional effect compared with GDC0449 alone (Fig. 5B and C).
In in vitro studies, GDC -0449 alone inhibited the growth of
OHTR2nd and T47D cells by about 50% (P < 0.05). Importantly,
the combination of GDC-0449 with tamoxifen suppressed
growth of OHTR2nd and T47D cells (P < 0.001, Fig. 5D and
E) almost completely. Similar observations were also recorded
with all other OHTR cell lines (data not shown). Growth of
parental MCF7 cells was inhibited by approximately 15% when
treated with GDC-0449 (data not shown). These data suggest
that GDC-0449 alone could be a targeted therapy for patients
with ERþ breast cancer who failed to respond to tamoxifen as
the ﬁrst line of therapy.
GLI1 expression in primary human breast tumors
correlates inversely with disease-free survival and
overall survival
To extend this key observation regarding the role of GLI1 in
breast cancer to patient survival, tissue microarrays containing
tissue cores representing 315 invasive breast cancers were
stained for Hh markers. The tumors were obtained through
a tissue banking protocol (OSU2009C009A) where patients
with newly diagnosed breast cancer were consented to have
their tumors stored for future research purposes and for longterm clinical follow-up. The median follow-up was 96 months.
The clinicopathologic characteristics of the tumors are listed
in Table 1. The expression of GLI1 and BMI1 are presented
in Fig. 6A. Epithelial and stromal GLI1 expression was observed
in 69% and 47% of the tumors, respectively. Epithelial Gl1
expression positively correlated with epithelial and stromal
BMI1 expression (P < 001). A signiﬁcant correlation was found
between increased epithelial GLI1 expression and lymph node
status (P ¼ 0.014) but no signiﬁcant association existed
between GLI1 expression and ER (P ¼ 0.31), PR (P ¼ 0.33),
HER2 (P ¼ 0.42) status and grade (P ¼ 1) of the tumor.
To establish a potential relationship between GLI1 overexpression and clinical outcomes, we ﬁrst conducted univariate survival probability analysis. Univariate survival analysis
showed that the following factors were associated with shorter
disease-free survival: high-epithelial GLI1 expression, ER-negative status, lymph node-positive status, higher tumor grade,
and Her2-positive tumors (Table 2). No signiﬁcant violation of
proportionality was detected for these variables. Multivariate
survival analysis showed that high epithelial GLI1 expression
was independently associated with shorter DFS [P ¼ 0.0375, HR
1.954 (1.039, 3.671)] when controlled for ER [P ¼ 0.0008, HR
0.397 (0.231, 0.682)], HER2 [P ¼ 0.0241, HR 1.908 (1.088, 3.346)],
and nodal status [P ¼ 0.0057 HR 2.108 (1.242, 3.576); Fig. 6B].
When analyzing this data on the basis of molecular subtypes,
among ER-positive tumors (N ¼ 230), epithelial GLI1 expression correlated with worse DFS in patients with node-positive
disease only (P < 0.01; Fig. 6C). For overall survival, univariate
survival analysis results were presented in Table 3. Multivariate
analysis selected the ﬁnal model in which grade and ER were
stratiﬁed and still showed a signiﬁcant GLI effect [P ¼ 0.014,
HR 2.156 (1.17, 3.98)] after adjusting for nodal status (Fig. 6D).

Furthermore, we asked the question whether among
patients that received tamoxifen as part of their adjuvant
therapy, if high GLI1 expression resulted in worse DFS. Among
the 98 patients with ER positive breast cancer, who received
tamoxifen as part of their adjuvant therapy, there were only a
total of 20 events in 10 years of follow-up and no statistically
signiﬁcant difference was seen between the groups with high or
low expression of GLI1. Considering the overall excellent
prognosis in this subset of patients, a larger sample size is
needed to identify a statistically signiﬁcant difference in clinical outcomes.

Discussion
We show here for the ﬁrst time the efﬁcacy of targeting Hh
pathway using a small molecule SMO inhibitor in improving
outcomes in tamoxifen-resistant tumors. Acquired resistance
to endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen is a major clinical
concern in the management of patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, which is clearly a complex phenomenon involving multiple pathways (32–36). Receptor tyrosinekinases have been frequently targeted to overcome endocrine
resistance in the past. We have presented here compelling data
using multiple approaches to show the role of Hh signaling

pathway in inducing tamoxifen-resistance, and the mechanism
of its activation.
Furthermore, we have showed a signiﬁcant correlation
between activation of Hh signaling in primary tumors (n ¼
315), and disease outcomes, conﬁrming the negative prognostic effect of high GLI1 expression on DFS and OS. Although
GLI1 expression did not correlate with a particular molecular
subtype, among ER positive, node positive tumors DFS was
worse in tumors with high GLI1expression. Hence the overall
association of Hh activation and poor outcome in breast
cancer signiﬁes that activation of this pathway facilitates
tumor growth and progression, supporting recently reported
association of increased Hh ligand expression with increased
risk of metastasis and breast cancer-speciﬁc death (19).

Our in vivo study revealed that blocking SMO with GDC-0449
alone could effectively suppress the tamoxifen-resistant xenografts in mice. Unlike our in vitro studies, addition of tamoxifen
to GDC-0449 had no further beneﬁt, which could be because of
the high dosage of GDC-0449 used in the in vivo studies, or the
tamoxifen concentrations achieved in the tumor may be lower
depending on its conversion to active metabolite in vivo. Using
monoclonal antibody 5E1 to Hh ligand (Shh) O'Toole and
colleagues showed metastases reduction in animal models of
breast cancer (19). Our data is unique in showing that targeting
the noncanonical Hh pathway speciﬁcally in ER-positive
breast cancers that are tamoxifen resistant using a clinically
available Hh inhibitor (GDC-0449) improves outcomes.
GDC-0449 (vismodegib) is a well tolerated, orally bioavailable

compound that is approved for the management of metastatic
or locally advanced basal cell carcinomas and being explored in
other cancers (http.clinicaltrials.gov). Our work indicates that
patients who developed resistance to tamoxifen, GDC-0049
alone will be effective in treating recurrent tumors and therefore designing appropriate clinical trials is warranted. It will be
interesting to determine if resistance to other endocrine
therapies such as aromatase inhibitors results in Hh pathway
activation, which we plan to pursue in the future.
One of the major challenges in treating a drug-resistant
tumor is the complex networking pathways that are involved in
the cross-talk between the distinct signaling pathways. The
PI3K/AKT pathway is one of many pathways that contribute to
endocrine resistance (37). Activation of the PI3K/AKT and the
p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways by receptors such as EGFR and IGF1-R suppresses the expression of ER
and PR (29, 38–42) and therefore, reduce estrogen dependence.
Our work clearly shows cross-talk between PI3K/AKT and Hh
pathway, and provides an additional mechanism for PI3K/
AKT-mediated endocrine resistance. Importantly, we showed
that increased activity of PI3K/AKT activity could stabilize
SMO and GLI1 protein by suppressing GSK3b–mediated phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation, leading to noncanonical Hh pathway activation. Although a previous study
reported cross-talk between PI3K/AKT and Hh pathway, it is
in NIH3T3 cells through activation of Hh ligands (43). Our data
suggests a rationale for combined targeting of PI3K/AKT and
Hh pathway to effectively overcome endocrine resistance.
In summary, there is still an urgency in designing targeted
therapies to overcome endocrine resistance. Our study
presents a potential therapeutic option to overcome such
resistance and a clinical trial targeting Hh pathway in
advanced hormone-refractory breast cancer is warranted and

is currently being pursued. Further, our ﬁnding underscores
the importance of PI3K pathway in activating Hh pathway and
provides the rationale for combinatorial targeted therapy in
breast cancer.
