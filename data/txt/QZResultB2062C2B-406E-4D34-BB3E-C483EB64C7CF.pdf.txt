Abstract
Nitric oxide synthases (NOS) are important mediators of
progrowth signaling in tumor cells, as they regulate angiogenesis, immune response, and immune-mediated wound
healing. Ionizing radiation (IR) is also an immune modulator
and inducer of wound response. We hypothesized that radiation therapeutic efﬁcacy could be improved by targeting
NOS following tumor irradiation. Herein, we show enhanced
radiation-induced (10 Gy) tumor growth delay in a syngeneic
model (C3H) but not immunosuppressed (Nu/Nu) squamous cell carcinoma tumor-bearing mice treated post-IR
with the constitutive NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). These results suggest a requirement of
T cells for improved radiation tumor response. In support
of this observation, tumor irradiation induced a rapid increase
in the immunosuppressive Th2 cytokine IL10, which was
abated by post-IR administration of L-NAME. In vivo suppres-

sion of IL10 using an antisense IL10 morpholino also extended the tumor growth delay induced by radiation in a manner
similar to L-NAME. Further examination of this mechanism
in cultured Jurkat T cells revealed L-NAME suppression of
IR-induced IL10 expression, which reaccumulated in the presence of exogenous NO donor. In addition to L-NAME, the
guanylyl cyclase inhibitors ODQ and thrombospondin-1 also
abated IR-induced IL10 expression in Jurkat T cells and
ANA-1 macrophages, which further suggests that the immunosuppressive effects involve eNOS. Moreover, cytotoxic Th1
cytokines, including IL2, IL12p40, and IFNg, as well as activated CD8þ T cells were elevated in tumors receiving post-IR
L-NAME. Together, these results suggest that post-IR NOS
inhibition improves radiation tumor response via Th1
immune polarization within the tumor microenvironment.

Introduction

Importantly, cell survival depends upon the ratio of activated
pro- and antiproliferative pathways, suggesting that irradiated
cells, which evade death, survive and progress to more aggressive
and therapeutically resistant tumors (3). Radiation-induced
signaling pathways associated with cancer progression include
elevated epidermal growth factor receptor, hypoxia inducible
factor-1 (HIF1), upregulation, and/or activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and overexpression of cytokines, including
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other immunosuppressive mediators that promote cancer survival, invasion,
and metastasis (4). Thus, the biology of sublethally irradiated
tumor cells favor survival, invasion, and angiogenesis, suggesting
that therapeutic efﬁcacy could be improved by combining radiation treatment with agents that target these or other progrowth
pathways induced by radiation (5).
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator of many progrowth signaling cascades in cancer (6–9). Nitric oxide
synthases (NOS) catalyze the production of NO by the ﬁveelectron oxidation of a guanidino nitrogen atom of the substrate L-arginine, which requires NADPH, FAD, FMN, heme,
and O2 as cofactors (10). Three NOS isoforms are known to
exist; neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS1), inducible NOS (iNOS
or NOS2), and endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS3). NO has
many diverse roles in normal physiology and tumor biology,
which are spatially, temporally, and concentration dependent.

Radiotherapy remains a primary mode of treatment for more
than 50% of cancer patients in North America (1). At the molecular level, ionizing radiation (IR) exerts its antitumor effects by
inducing direct DNA damage in the form of DNA double-strand
breaks as well as indirect damage by the generation of reactive
oxygen species (2). Although DNA damage has a central role in
radiation-induced tumor cell death, it does not fully account for
tumor response to local radiation. In addition to stimulation of
DNA repair, IR induces multiple cellular signaling pathways.

NOS Inhibition Alters Post-IR Tumor Immune Response

The constitutive isoforms eNOS and nNOS are tightly regulated
by Ca2þ/calmodulin, and produce low ﬂux (pmol/L) NO over
short periods of time. In contrast, the inducible isoform iNOS is
Ca2þ independent and generates higher ﬂux NO over a longer
period of time that can range from nmol/L to mmol/L in
concentration, depending upon the stimulant (11). NOS has
been studied extensively in carcinogenesis. Although elevated
NOS3 expression has a role in tumor angiogenesis, increased
NOS2 expression predicts poor therapeutic response, tumor
progression, and decreased patient survival (9, 12–15). To date,
our molecular signatures suggest that NO-mediated prosurvival, cell migration, angiogenesis, and stem cell marker (i.e.,
ERK, Akt, IL8, IL6, S100A8, CD44) signaling in tumors and
tumor cells occurs at 400 nmol/L steady-state NO (6, 9).
Together, these observations suggest that the NOS enzymes are
exploitable therapeutic targets.
NO produced by the constitutive eNOS isoform controls
blood ﬂow and is a key mediator of the pro-angiogenic effects
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; ref. 16). A clinical
study demonstrated reduced tumor blood volume within 1 hour
of administration of the competitive NOS inhibitor nitro-Larginine (L-NNA), which lasted for 24 hours in all patients
studied (17). Side effects of NOS inhibition included bradycardia and hypertension, which were not study limiting and suggest
that NOS inhibition may be a beneﬁcial therapeutic option for
combined modalities (17). Advances in radiotherapy have
included the co-administration of anti-angiogenic (AA) drugs,
which radiosensitize endothelial cells (18). IR also activates
constitutive NOS, as well as ERK1/2 kinase prosurvival signaling, both of which were blocked by L-NNA (19). In addition,
the administration of L-NNA 24 hours prior to 10 Gy irradiation of tumor-bearing mice demonstrated reduced tumor
blood ﬂow and increased tumor cell apoptosis when compared
to mice receiving radiation or L-NNA alone, further supporting
NOS inhibition as a target to improve radiation therapeutic
response (20).
In addition to targeting tumor vasculature, IR modulates host
immunity and mimics vaccine response by enhancing the
release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) from
dying cells, which then activate cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL)
through toll-like receptor activation (21). IR facilitates antigenpresenting cell and T-cell penetration into the tumor (22), and
also impacts host immunity through modulation of both proand antitumor responses depending upon the Th1 (cytotoxic)
versus Th2 (immunosuppressive) cytokine milieu and associated immune cell mediators (21). Macrophages exposed to
Th1 cytokines exhibit increased levels of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine production, antigen presentation, and cytotoxic activity. In contrast, macrophages exposed to Th2 cytokines exhibit
an immunosuppressive phenotype associated with blocked
CTL activity, increased angiogenesis, tissue restoration, and
wound healing response (23). T-regulatory cells (Tregs) are
pivotal mediators of immune suppression and the development of immunologic tolerance through their ability to limit
antitumor immune responses (24). Tregs mediate tumor
immune tolerance in part through the secretion of IL10, TGFb,
or IL35 immunosuppressive molecules (24). Indeed, IL10 and
TGFb derived from Tregs promote tumor progression through
antitumor immune suppression (25). NO also mediates both
cGMP-dependent and -independent Th1–Th2 immune transition and may be important in the tumor response to radiation-

induced injury (26, 27). To explore this hypothesis, we examined cytokine expression proﬁles and T-cell activation during
radiation-induced tumor growth delay in a syngeneic model
treated post-IR with the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine
methyl ester (L-NAME).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Jurkat cells (Jurkat clone E6-1) were obtained from the ATCC
and maintained in 5% CO2, RPMI-1640 culture medium with
10% FBS and 100 IU/mL Pen Strep antibiotics (Life Technologies). Jurkat cells were treated with IR (0, 1, or 5 Gy) in the
presence or absence of various concentrations of DETA/NO
(0, 30, 60, 100, 300, 500, and 100 mmol/L), L-NAME (0, 500,
or 1,000 mmol/L), or the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (10
mmol/L) or thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1: 1 mg/mL). The NONOate
donors, including DETA/NO, are stable when maintained in basic
conditions (10 mmol/L NaOH) but release NO at deﬁned rates
at physiologic pH (28); 10 mmol/L NaOH served as vehicle
control in experiments utilizing the NO donor DETA/NO.
The ANA-1 macrophage cell line used in this study was established by immortalization of bone marrow macrophages from
C57BL/6 mice with J2 recombinant retrovirus-expressing
v-myc/v-raf oncogenes (29). ANA-1 cells were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin,
plated at a density of 5  105 per well in a 12-well plate and grown
overnight.
Suppression of IL10
Silencing of IL10 protein translation was accomplished by
using an antisense 25-mer oligo (Gene Tools) designed speciﬁcally to block the AUG translational start site of mouse IL10
(GenBank accession no. NM_010548: oligo sequence, 5AGCTCTCTTTTCTGCAAGGCTGCTT). This oligo complements
the sequence from 31 to 6 relative to the initiation codon.
Suppression of secreted IL10 protein levels were veriﬁed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Raw 267.4 (30) cells pretreated
with control or IL10 morpholino. Cell culture media was collected
at 24 and 48 hours and IL10 protein levels were measured by
ELISA assay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.
In vivo mouse tumor model
The Animal Care and Use Committee (National Cancer
Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD) approved mouse protocols.
Female C3H/Hen or athymic nude mice were supplied by the
Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center Animal
Production Area (Frederick, MD). The animals were received
at 6 weeks of age, housed ﬁve per cage, and given autoclaved
food and water ad libitum. Experiments were performed at 9 to
10 weeks of age and in accordance with principles outlined in
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of
Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council,
Washington, DC). Squamous cell carcinoma VII/SF tumor cells
(SCC) were derived from spontaneous abdominal wall squamous cell cancer (obtained from Dr. T. Phillips, UCSF, San
Francisco, CA) and propagated in C3H/Hen mice (31). For
growth delay studies, 2  105 viable SCC cells were injected into
the subcutaneous space of the right hind leg of 8-week-old

C3H/Hen or nude mice and grown for 1 week when tumor size
reached approximately 200 mm3 in size. Similarly, human
colon carcinoma HT29 tumor xenografts were grown in nude
mice injected with 1  106 cells. C57BL/6 WT or eNOS/ (The
Jackson Laboratory Stock No. 002684) mice on the same
background were injected with 1  106 B16 melanoma cells.
SNP analysis (DartMouse, The Geisel School of Medicine at
Dartmouth, Dartmouth, NH) demonstrated background purities of C57BL/6 WT and eNOS/ mice to be 99.8% and 98.9%,
respectively, when compared to the in-house control. Tumor
volume was measured by caliper and calculated as mm3 ¼
[width2  length]/2 where width was the smaller dimension.
Tumor irradiation was accomplished by securing each animal in
a specially designed Lucite jig ﬁtted with lead shielding that
protected the body from radiation while allowing exposure of
the tumor-bearing leg. A Therapax DXT300 X-ray irradiator
(Pantak, Inc.) using 2.0 mm A1 ﬁltration (300 KVp) at a dose
rate of 2.53 Gy/min was used as the X-ray source. Irradiated
tumors received one 10 Gy dose. Designated groups of animals
were treated with NOS inhibitor L-NAME or IL10 suppressing
agents. NOS inhibition was achieved by administering L-NAME
post-IR in the drinking water at a concentration of 0.5 g/L for
the duration of the experiment (20). IL10 protein levels were
suppressed using an IL10 morpholino; mice were injected with
a 750 mL volume of 10 mmol/L IL10 morpholino (Gene Tools)
or a four base-mismatched control morpholino in saline 48
hours prior to irradiation. After irradiation, the mice were
returned to their cages, and tumors were measured three times
each week thereafter to assess tumor growth. Animals were
euthanized when tumor growth approached the maximum
allowable limit.
Cytokine screen
Control and irradiated tumors (L-NAME) were collected at 0,
0.25, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days post-irradiation. Cytokine protein
expression was evaluated by Q-Plex multiplex ELISA arrays
(QUANSYS Biosciences).
Isolation of leukocytes from spleen
Spleens were harvested from tumor-bearing animals, placed in
sterile saline, and ﬁltered through a two-chamber sterile Filtra-Bag
(Fisher Scientiﬁc). Splenocytes were counted by Sysmex KX-21
(Roche Diagnostics).
Isolation of tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes
Tumors were dissected and ﬁltered through a two-chamber
sterile Filtra-Bag (Fisher Scientiﬁc), then digested in RPMI
containing 5% fetal calf serum, 700 units/mL collagenase (Invitrogen), 100 mg/mL DNAse I (Boehringer Mannheim), and 1
mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0), at 37 C for 45 minutes. The homogenate
was then processed in a tissue stomacher-80 (Seward) for 30
seconds, washed with HBSS (BioWhittaker), and resuspended in
40% Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia) in DMEM medium (BioWhittaker). The suspension was underlaid with 80% Percoll and
centrifuged for 25 minutes at 1,000  g. Leukocytes were collected
from the interphase, washed, and counted.
Flow cytometry
Cells (1  106) were incubated in cell staining buffer (0.1%
BSA, 0.1% sodium azide) containing 250 mg/mL 2.4G2 ascites,
which blocks nonspeciﬁc Fc receptor antibody binding for 15

2790 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

minutes. Cells were stained with ﬂuorescently conjugated antibodies (BD Pharmingen) for 20 minutes. Labeled cells were
washed twice in cell staining buffer and analyzed on a BD Facs
Canto II ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative realtime PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRizol (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA samples were reverse
transcribed into cDNA using Sprint RT Complete 8-well strips
(Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.
Primer pairs were designed for IL10 that recognized F:
TTAAGGGTTACCTGGGTTGC and R: GCCTGAGGGTCTTCAGGTTC sequences using the IL10 gene Ref Seq sequences by
Primer3 (32). All quantitative real-time PCR reactions were
designed to follow a universal real time PCR condition: 94 C 2
minutes, 45 cycles of 94 C 30 seconds, and 60 C 30 seconds in
PowerSYBR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Amplicon speciﬁcity was checked by BLAST search and on a 2% FlashGel (Lonza)
to ensure that neither nonspeciﬁc amplicons nor primer–dimer
complexes were formed. Relative expression was calculated using
the ddCt formula. Ampliﬁcation efﬁciencies for primers were
checked against the 18S housekeeping gene to ensure signals
were detected in PCR exponential phase and that primers had
similar ampliﬁcation efﬁciencies.
Jurkat and CD47-deﬁcient JinB8 Jurkat cells (1  106; ref. 33)
were plated on 12-well plates (Corning) using RPM1 medium þ
2% FBS at 37 C in 5% CO2 and treated with 1 mg/mL TSP-1 for
6 hours. Untreated cells were used as controls. Total RNA was
extracted using TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche). The ﬁrst
strand cDNA was made using Maxima First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Primer
sequences for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1
(HPRT1; 50 -ATT GTA ATG ACC AGT CAA CAG GG-30 /50 -GCA
TTG TTT TGC CAG TGT CAA-30 ) and IL10 (50 -AAA TTA GCC
GGG CAT GGT GG-30 /50 -CTG CAA CTT CCA TCT CCT GGG T30 ) were used for real-time PCR performed using SYBR Green
(Roche) on an MJ Research Opticon I instrument (Bio-Rad)
with the following ampliﬁcation program: 95 C for 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds, 58 C for 20
seconds, 72 C for 25 seconds, and 72 C for 1 minute. Melting
curves were performed for each product from 30 C to 95 C,
reading every 0.5 C with a 6-second dwell time. Fold change in
mRNA expression was calculated by normalizing to HPRT1
mRNA level. Two-factor ANOVA with replication was used for
statistics analysis.
Automated capillary Western blot
Western blots were performed using WES, an automated
capillary-based size sorting system (ProteinSimple; ref. 34). All
procedures were performed with manufacturer's reagents
according to their user manual. Brieﬂy, 8 mL of diluted protein
lysate was mixed with 2 mL of 5 ﬂuorescent master mix and
heated at 95 C for 5 minutes. The samples (1 mg), blocking
reagent, wash buffer, primary antibodies, secondary antibodies,
and chemiluminescent substrate were dispensed into designated wells in a manufacturer provided microplate. The plate
was loaded into the instrument and protein was drawn into
individual capillaries on a 25 capillary cassette provided by
the manufacturer. Protein separation and immunodetection
was performed automatically on the individual capillaries

Results
NOS inhibition enhances radiation-induced tumor growth
delay in syngeneic mice
Tumor growth delay is described by the substance enhancement ratio (SER), which is the ratio of time required for treated
versus control tumors to reach a deﬁned size (1,000 mm3). The
effect of NOS inhibition by L-NAME, a NOS inhibitor that is

more selective for the constitutive isoforms (eNOS and nNOS;
ref. 35), on radiation-induced tumor growth delay was examined
in a syngeneic murine model of SCC tumor-bearing C3H mice.
L-NAME was administered in the animals' drinking water (0.5 g/L)
following tumor irradiation (post-IR, 10 Gy). Because NO regulates vascular tonicity, we chose post-IR administration
of L-NAME to minimize vascular constriction and maintain
tumor pO2 prior to and during tumor irradiation while targeting
vascular constriction post-IR. Figure 1A demonstrates enhanced
radiation-induced tumor growth delay in mice that received
post-IR L-NAME (SER 3.3) when compared to tumors treated
with 10 Gy IR alone (SER 1.8). The iNOS-speciﬁc inhibitor
aminoguanidine was also tested, and yielded an SER of 2.1.
Interestingly, L-NAME–mediated NOS inhibition had no effect
on the radiation-induced tumor growth delay of HT29 human
adenocarcinoma cells or SCC xenografts in immunosuppressed
nude mice lacking T cells (Fig. 1B and C, respectively). These
results indicate a requirement of T cells for L-NAME potentiation
of radiation-induced tumor growth delay.

Effect of L-NAME on radiation-induced cytokine expression
in syngeneic mice
T cells are lymphocytes that direct cell-mediated immunity
and are distinguished from other lymphocytes by the presence
of cell surface T-cell receptors. There are several subsets of
T cells, each with a distinct function; proliferating helper T
cells differentiate into two major types of effector T cells known
as Th1 and Th2 cells, which secrete speciﬁc cytokines that
mediate different immune responses. Th1 cells are proinﬂammatory, mediate host immunity to foreign pathogens, and are
induced by IL2, IL12, and their effector cytokine IFNg (36).
In contrast, Th2 cells are immunosuppressive, secrete IL4, IL5,
IL10 as well as TGFb, and mediate wound resolution following
pro-inﬂammatory assault (37). To explore a potential role for
NOS-derived NO during radiation-induced T-cell response,
QPlex was used to examine alterations in tumor cytokine
expression. Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the impact
of NOS inhibition by L-NAME, on the trend of Th1 versus Th2
cytokine protein expression induced by 10 Gy tumor irradiation, whereas Supplementary Table S2 summarizes pg/mg cytokine levels as well as P-values and fold-change, as a function of
time after irradiation. The trend of Th1 versus Th2 cytokine
protein expression summarized in Supplementary Table S1
suggests that tumors receiving radiation alone rapidly acquire
(within 24 hours) an overall Th2 signaling proﬁle as deﬁned by
early elevation of IL10 (Day 1) followed by increased IL5, IL3,
and IL4 tumor expression (Day 2–4). In contrast, tumors from
animals that received post-IR L-NAME exhibited a Th1 proﬁle as
deﬁned by elevated IL2 (6 hours, Day 1), IL12, and IFNg (Day 3,
4, 7) tumor expression. The most profound observation pertained to the dramatic early induction of IL10 24-hour post-IR,
which was abated by L-NAME (Fig. 2A). These results suggest
the rapid induction of an IL10-mediated immunosuppressive

phenotype in response to tumor irradiation, which was abolished by post-IR NOS inhibition. We also examined tumor
NOS isoform protein expression 24-hour post-IR. When compared to control, Fig. 2B shows increased iNOS protein expression in the 10 and 10 Gy þ L-NAME tumors. This is an
interesting observation considering that constitutive NOS
inhibition by L-NAME was more effective in extending the
radiation-induced tumor growth delay. This may be explained
by the ﬁndings of Connelly and colleagues (38) who demonstrated that eNOS is required for the full activation of iNOS.

NO–induced IL10 expression in Jurkat T cells and ANA-1
macrophages
IL10 is generally produced by differentiated monocytes and
lymphocytes (i.e., macrophages and T cells, respectively). To
further examine the involvement of NO during radiationinduced IL10 expression, we used Jurkat cells, which are T
lymphocytes that express IL10 and are commonly employed
to study T-cell signaling. Cytokine expression proﬁles were
examined in cells exposed to the slow releasing NO donor
DETA/NO, which mimics NO ﬂux under inﬂammatory conditions. Figure 3 demonstrates NO concentration-dependent
induction of IL10 mRNA (A) and protein (B) in Jurkat cells,
which peaked at 300 mmol/L DETA/NO. Next, Jurkat cells were
exposed to 1 Gy irradiation, then treated with or without
L-NAME, and incubated overnight to mimic the tumor xenograft irradiation protocol. Figure 3C shows a greater than fourfold increase in Jurkat IL10 expression 24 hours after 1 Gy
irradiation, which was abated by L-NAME and is similar to the
L-NAME effect on radiation-induced tumor IL10 expression
shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the L-NAME suppressed IL10
levels re-accumulated to that induced by 1 Gy irradiation in the
presence of the exogenous NO donor DETA/NO at concentrations of 100 to 500 mmol/L or 400 nmol/L steady-state NO
(Fig. 3C; refs. 6, 7, and 12). To date, our breast cancer biomarker signatures suggest that NO-mediated prosurvival, cell
migration, angiogenesis, and stem cell marker (i.e., ERK, Akt,
IL8, IL6, S100A8, CD44) signaling in tumors and tumor cells
occurs at 400 nmol/L steady-state NO (6, 7, 9, 12, 39). When
considering this molecular signature, the results shown in Fig.
3A–C are consistent with our earlier reports and suggest that
400 nmol/L steady-state NO modulates radiation-induced
IL10 expression in Jurkat cells. Also, the NO ﬂux-dependent
regulatory trend of IL10 shown in Fig. 3C resembles a bellshaped curve, which is consistent with low ﬂux NO regulation
of wound response vs. high ﬂux NO-mediated toxicity (11,
40–42).
L-NAME is more selective for the constitutive NOS isoforms,
which implicates possible eNOS/cGMP-dependent signaling
(35, 43). To explore the potential of cGMP-dependent signaling
during radiation-induced IL10 expression, Jurkat cells were
exposed to 1 Gy IR  the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ, which
completely abolished IL10 expression induced by 1 Gy IR (Fig.
3D). TSP-1 inhibits NO signaling through its receptor CD47 by
inhibiting eNOS activation and abating NO-dependent cGMP
synthesis and cGMP-dependent protein kinase signaling in vascular cells and Jurkat T cells (41, 42). Exogenous TSP-1 also
blocked radiation-induced Jurkat IL10 expression, suggesting
eNOS/cGMP-dependence for this process (Fig. 3D). Inhibition
of IL10 expression by TSP-1 is CD47-dependent because

inhibition of basal IL10 mRNA expression was lost in the CD47deﬁcient Jurkat mutant JinB8 (Fig. 3E). The 2-fold stimulation
of IL10 mRNA by TSP-1 in the CD47 mutant is consistent with
reported positive effects of TSP-1 on IL10 expression mediated
by the TSP-1 receptor CD36 (44). Radiation also induced IL10
in murine ANA-1 macrophages, which was abated by L-NAME,
ODQ and TSP-1, indicating that cGMP-dependent regulation
of IL10 is not restricted to T cells (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these
results indicate that radiation-induced IL10 expression in T cells is
tightly controlled by low constitutive NOS-derived NO ﬂux.
IL10 suppression enhances radiation-induced tumor growth
delay
Post-IR NOS inhibition by L-NAME enhanced radiationinduced tumor growth delay and abated radiation-induced IL10
expression (Figs. 1A and 2, respectively). To examine a role of IL10
in the recovery from post-IR tumor growth delay, IL10 protein
translation was suppressed by treatment with an IL10 morpholino (45, 46). Conﬁrmation of the morpholino efﬁcacy for IL10
protein suppression was veriﬁed using LPS-stimulated Raw 267.4
cells because LPS is a strong inducer of IL10 in these cells (30) as
shown in Fig. 4A. Next, tumor-bearing animals were treated with
IL10 or control morpholino 48 hours prior to tumor irradiation.
IL10 morpholino treatment enhanced the radiation-induced
tumor growth delay (SER 2.7) as shown in Fig. 4B in a manner
similar to that observed by L-NAME (Fig. 1A) but had no effect on
tumor growth in the absence of radiation. These results suggest
that radiation-induced tumor growth delay can be improved by

L-NAME

increases tumor-associated CD8þ cytolytic T cells

post-IR
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are a subgroup of T cells that when
activated kill invading pathogens and tumor cells. These cells are
commonly referred to as CD8þ T cells because they express cell
surface CD8 glycoprotein. Importantly, immunosuppressive
molecules, including IL10, can inactivate CD8þ T cells. To identify
the presence of CD8þ T cells, markers of tumor lymphocyte
inﬁltration were examined in control and 10 Gy  L-NAME
tumors, as well as spleen from tumor-bearing mice. Figure 5A
shows increased tumor-associated CD8þ T cells in irradiated
tumors treated with L-NAME but not spleen taken from the same
animals (Fig. 5B). CD69 is a marker of T-cell activation. Figure 5C
demonstrates increased CD8þ CD69þ mean ﬂuorescence intensity in inﬁltrating lymphocytes from irradiated tumors treated
with L-NAME but not in spleen taken from the same animals (Fig.
5D). Importantly, these results implicate a localized tumor
response culminating in the elevation of activated cytotoxic T
cells in post-IR NOS inhibited tumors. Neutrophils, dendritic
cells, and immature myeloid cells from post-IR treated L-NAME
tumors were elevated on day 3, when compared to irradiated
tumors (Fig. 5E–G). In contrast, Tregs and natural killer cells did
not change (Fig. 5H and I). Collectively, these results demonstrate
that altered NO ﬂux via L-NAME–mediated NOS inhibition can
improve the efﬁcacy of therapeutic radiation by immune polarization favoring a proinﬂammatory phenotype within the tumor
microenvironment in an SCC/C3H syngeneic model.
L-NAME is more selective for inhibiting the constitutive
NOS isoforms (eNOS and nNOS) and our cell culture results
implicate eNOS/cGMP-dependent signaling (Fig. 3) in the
immune polarization shown in Fig. 5. To further explore a role
of eNOS in the potentiation of radiation therapeutic efﬁcacy, we
examined the radiation-induced tumor growth delay of murine
B16 melanoma xenografts in wild-type (WT) and eNOS knockout (eNOS/) mice on the C57BL/6 background (Fig. 6A).
When compared to control, the irradiated tumor in WT mice
yielded an SER of 2 (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with the
SCC/C3H syngeneic model shown in Fig. 1A. Remarkably, the
irradiated tumor in eNOS/ animals exhibited an SER of 5.5
when compared to the WT-irradiated tumor (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, IL10 protein was not detected in B16 xenografts grown in
WT C57BL/6 or eNOS/ on the same background under these
conditions; however, the cytokine protein expression proﬁle of
irradiated tumors in eNOS/ mice exhibited signiﬁcantly elevated Th1 cytokines, including IL2, TNFa, and IFNg, as shown
in Fig. 6B–D. Importantly, radiation has been shown to induce
eNOS expression, which promotes tumor recovery from radiation
injury (47). Together, these results suggest that eNOS has a vital
role in acute tumor radiation response and that improved pharmacology of NOS inhibitors in combination with radiation may
be therapeutically beneﬁcial.

Discussion
The role of NO ﬂux within the tumor microenvironment
as it relates to therapeutic efﬁcacy is complex. Studies have
shown that steady-state NO modulation within the tumor
microenvironment leads to improved radiation therapeutic

efﬁcacy (20, 47, 48). NO mediates numerous effects at the
cellular and physiological levels. Similar to molecular O2, the
outer p orbital of NO has an unpaired electron, which imparts a
high afﬁnity for other radicals, including radiation-induced
carbon radicals on DNA, which leads to ﬁxed DNA damage
and enhanced NO-mediated radiosensitivity (49). In support
of this early observation, a recent study demonstrated that
the presence of low steady-state NO dramatically enhanced

2796 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

radiosensitization as well as increased the time of DNA repair,
when compared to anoxic and aerated control tumors (50).
Similarly, site-speciﬁc iNOS transgene expression driven by the
radiation-inducible pE9 promoter demonstrated enhanced
tumor radiation response under hypoxic conditions (51).
In addition to these direct effects of NO-mediated radiosensitization, altered NO gradients prior to tumor irradiation have
been shown to normalize tumor vasculature, which increased
tumor oxygen tension and tumor response to radiation (52).
In contrast, administration of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME
before and after radiation minimized the cytotoxic effect of
NO under conditions of hypoxia (48). In this context, NO
improved radiation therapeutic efﬁcacy by enhanced tumor
perfusion and oxygen effect (53). Thus, NO modulation prior
to and at the time of radiation is therapeutically beneﬁcial.
Together, these studies demonstrate the contextual dependence of timing and distinct mechanisms directed by NO ﬂux
for improved tumor response to radiotherapy.
Although the modulation of tumor NO ﬂux prior to irradiation improves tumor oxygenation and radiation efﬁcacy,
NO also promotes angiogenesis in the context of immunemediated wound response (40–42), which may facilitate postirradiation recovery of a sublethally irradiated tumor. Indeed,
macrophages employ NO generated by both eNOS and iNOS
during wound response (40, 54) and in vivo models have
shown delayed wound closure in iNOS knockout mice (55).
Toward this end, IR-induced angiogenesis (56) through NO
signaling (47), which promoted tumor recovery following
radiation injury. These observations suggest that post-irradiation inhibition of angiogenesis may be beneﬁcial. Thus, we
hypothesized that improved radiation therapeutic efﬁcacy and
extended tumor growth delay may be achievable by targeting
NO ﬂux through NOS inhibition following tumor irradiation.
Interestingly, post-IR administration of the constitutive NOS
inhibitor L-NAME extended radiation-induced tumor growth
delay and was more effective than the selective iNOS inhibitor
aminoguanidine (Fig. 1A). Moreover, L-NAME extended the
radiation-induced tumor growth delay only in syngeneic mice
but not nude mice. This observation implicates the involvement of innate immunity and cytotoxic T cells in enhanced
radiosensitivity, which is regulated by NO ﬂux, and further
supported by the cytokine expression proﬁle of post-IR NOSinhibited tumors that expressed high levels of cytotoxic Th1
cytokines, including IL2, IFNg, and IL12p40, as summarized
in Fig. 7. In contrast, tumors receiving radiation alone exhibited
immunosuppressive Th2 signaling, as indicated by increased
IL10, IL5, and IL4 cytokine expression (Supplementary Tables
S1 and S2). Moreover, tumor cytokine expression analysis
revealed enhanced IL10 protein levels 24 hours following
tumor irradiation in SCC-tumor bearing C3H mice, which was
abolished by L-NAME (Fig. 2) and conﬁrmed in irradiated
Jurkat T lymphocytes and ANA-1 macrophages (Fig. 3). Importantly, in vivo IL10 protein suppression extended radiationinduced tumor growth delay in C3H mice in a manner similar
to that of L-NAME. These ﬁndings implicate a novel role for
NO as a stimulator of IL10-mediated tumor immunosuppressive signaling, which accelerates tumor recovery and regrowth
in response to radiation injury in the C3H model.
Cytokine expression analysis of ANA-1 macrophages, and
Jurkat T cells demonstrated increased IL10 expression 24 hours
after 1 Gy irradiation, which was abated by L-NAME, suggesting

that radiation-induced IL10 could come from these cell types.
Although we used a variety of sensitive detection methods,
including ﬂow cytometry analysis of IL10 associated with markers
of speciﬁc immune cell populations, as well as ﬂow cytometry
analysis of GFP-IL10–tagged mice, we were unable to conﬁrm the
speciﬁc cellular source of IL10 in our experiments. In addition, no
signiﬁcant changes in Treg cell populations were observed that
might account for the cellular source of increased IL10 levels
following irradiation. Ongoing studies are aimed at identifying
the relative contributions of leukocyte subsets to IL10 following
tumor irradiation.
Flow cytometry analysis of immune cell mediators demonstrated increased CD8þ expression and CD8þ/CD69þ MFI
(indicative of cytotoxic CD8þ T-cell activation) in postIR NOS-inhibited C3H tumor xenografts but not spleen
(Fig. 5A–D), implicating a localized immune response at the
irradiated tumor site. The results herein further support a
key role for NO ﬂux-dependent regulation of IFNg and cytotoxic T-cell activation for improved radiation therapeutic
efﬁcacy (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2; Figs. 5 and 6).
Indeed, cytotoxic CD8þ T cells mediate cell killing through
increased IFNg (57), and inhibition of either IFNg or CD8þ
T cells abolished the therapeutic efﬁcacy of radiation in
colon adenocarcinoma tumor-bearing mice (58). In addition,
our results indicate that L-NAME potentiation of radiation

www.aacrjournals.org

treatment efﬁcacy is eNOS/cGMP-dependent. Suppression
of eNOS/cGMP-dependent signaling by the guanylyl cyclase inhibitors ODQ or TSP-1 abolished radiation-induced
IL10 expression in Jurkat T lymphocytes and ANA-1 macrophages (Fig. 3). Also, radiation-induced tumor growth delay
was dramatically enhanced in eNOS/ tumor xenografts,
which exhibited increased Th1 cytokine expression (Fig. 6).
Thus, radiation-induced tumor injury promotes a Th2 immunosuppressive proﬁle that is eNOS/cGMP-dependent and
involves low NO ﬂux.
The post-IR NOS-inhibited tumor exhibited enhanced
expression of IL2, IFNg, and IL12p40 Th1 mediators (Supplementary Table S1). IL2 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has pivotal
roles during immune regulation in response to foreign pathogens (59). IL2 is produced primarily by CD4þ T cells and
promotes the differentiation, expansion, and cytolytic activation of cytotoxic T cells. Importantly, IL2 effects are receptor
mediated; IL2 interaction with IL12Rb2 leads to upregulation
of IFNg and IL12 during Th1-cell differentiation (59). Interestingly, a cGMP-dependent role of low ﬂux NO in the selective
upregulation of IL12Rb2 has been reported (26). IL12 is also
important for sustaining memory/effector T cells, which promote long-term protection against pathogens and tumors. IL2
also interacts with IL2Ra to promote CD8þ T-cell differentiation and activation (59). Importantly, these cytokine activation

proﬁles are consistent with the time course analysis showing
elevated IL2, IFNg, and IL12p40 in the post-IR NOS-inhibited
tumors summarized in Supplementary Table S1, as well as
CD8þ T-cell regulation shown in Fig. 5. In contrast, tumors
receiving irradiation alone demonstrated increased IL10 followed by elevated Th2 mediators IL5, IL3, and IL4. Interestingly, IL2 was also elevated in these irradiated tumors and
may have played a role in the upregulation of IL4 and IL5 Th2
cell differentiation, which is IL4Ra dependent (59). The proinﬂammatory cytokine IL1a was also observed in the irradiated tumor. Despite its proinﬂammatory status, IL1a released
by solid tumors acts as a chemoattractant to facilitate malignancy-associated inﬂammatory responses (60).
Collectively, the results herein suggest a novel mechanism of
low ﬂux NO during Th1–Th2 transition, tumor immunosuppressive signaling, and accelerated wound recovery in the tumor
response to ionizing irradiation. Importantly, CD8þ T-cell regulation and IFNg expression seem to be determined by NO ﬂuxdependent IL10 versus IL2 signaling cascades, which can be
modulated by pharmacological NOS inhibition and may provide
a novel immunotherapeutic approach for improved radiation
therapeutic efﬁcacy.
