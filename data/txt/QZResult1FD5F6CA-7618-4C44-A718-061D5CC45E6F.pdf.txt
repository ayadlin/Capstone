BACKGROUND. To the authors’ knowledge, there is no established second-line
chemotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer who have received gemcitabine-based therapy. A phase 2 trial was conducted to explore the efficacy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
previously who were treated with gemcitabine.

METHODS. Patients aged 65 years who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 1 received oxaliplatin at a dose of

daily for 14 days. The treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. Tumor measurements were performed every 9 weeks and the primary study objective was 6month overall survival.

RESULTS. The study enrolled 41 patients. Of the 39 evaluable patients, 1 patient
had a partial response and 10 patients demonstrated stable disease. The KaplanMeier estimate of the overall median survival was 23 weeks (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 17.0-31.0 weeks). Progression-free survival was 9.9 weeks (95%
CI, 9.6-14.5 weeks). The 6-month and 1-year survival rates were 44% (95% CI,
31%-62%) and 21% (95% CI, 11%-38%), respectively. The most common grade
3-4 nonhematologic toxicity was fatigue (toxicity was graded using the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]).

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin is active in gemcitabine-pretreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, especially in
patients with a good PS and those who have responded to first-line chemotherapy.

n 1997, gemcitabine became the standard of care as first-line
therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer based on a pivotal randomized phase 3 trial that compared gemcitabine against bolus 5fluorouracil (5-FU) for clinical benefit response, objective tumor
response, and survival.1 In that study, gemcitabine produced a better clinical benefit response rate (23.8% vs 4.8%; P 5 .0022) and a
better median survival (5.7 months vs 4.4 months; P 5 .0025). These
results led the US Food and Drug Administration to recommend it
as front-line therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. Since that
time, several large randomized trials have been conducted in an
attempt to improve gemcitabine’s efficacy as front-line therapy by
combining it with other cytotoxic agents or molecular targeted
agents.2–6 In general, neither statistically significant nor clinically

significant improvements in overall survival have
been observed with any gemcitabine doublet except
for gemcitabine and erlotinib.6 Unfortunately, the
observed incremental survival advantage conferred
with the addition of erlotinib has been very small
(6.24 months vs 5.91 months; P 5 .025). Although
efforts to improve on gemcitabine as front-line therapy have been going on for years, studies for those
patients whose tumors are initially resistant to gemcitabine, or become refractory after initial response
to gemcitabine-based therapy, have not taken priority. This is clinically important because high-quality
cross-sectional imaging is able to identify patients
with relatively low volume metastatic disease, many
of whom will present with well-preserved performance status (PS). There is an increasing proportion of
patients who will quickly fail gemcitabine and yet
maintain sufficient PS to receive second-line therapy,
which to our knowledge has not been defined to
date.
In previous studies, both capecitabine and oxaliplatin have been used as components of front-line
therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. Capecitabine
is an oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate designed to
generate 5-FU preferentially in tumor tissue through
exploitation of high intratumoral concentrations of
thymidine phosphorylase.7 A phase 3 trial of capecitabine for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
reported that 10 (24%) of 42 patients experienced a
clinical benefit response (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 12.1%-39.5%) as evidenced by improvement in pain intensity, analgesic consumption, and/
or Karnofsky PS. Three of the 41 patients with measurable disease had an objective partial response
(7.3%), and for the entire cohort the median overall
survival was 6.1 months.8 Two subsequent phase 3
trials compared gemcitabine plus capecitabine
(GemCap) versus gemcitabine alone.9,10 The Swiss
Group for Clinical Cancer Research and the Central
European Cooperative Oncology Group study demonstrated that GemCap does not improve the overall survival duration compared with gemcitabine
alone. However, subgroup analysis suggested that
patients with good PS (Karnofsky score of 90%-100%)
had a significant improvement of median overall survival when treated with the combination compared
with the good PS patients receiving gemcitabine. A
similarly designed trial was conducted in 533
untreated patients in the UK.10 Preliminary results
have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival duration (7.4 months vs 6
months; P 5 .014) in patients who received GemCap
compared with those who received gemcitabine
alone and the final analysis had not been reported at

2047

the time of last follow–up. Taken together, these trials
demonstrate that when capecitabine is given alone
or in combination with gemcitabine it has antitumor
activity in pancreatic cancer, especially when delivered to patients with a good PS.
Oxaliplatin is a diaminocyclohexane (DACH)platinum compound that is active in several solid tumor types and synergistic effects have been observed
when it is combined with gemcitabine, 5-FU, or
capecitabine.11–13 Oxaliplatin has been studied in
combination with gemcitabine (GemOx) in 2 large
randomized trials and, although neither demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage
compared with gemcitabine alone, both showed that
GemOx improved progression-free survival.4,14
Importantly, the combination of oxaliplatin and
capecitabine has been an effective and well-tolerated
regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer and there is
limited preclinical and clinical experience with these
agents that also suggest activity in pancreatic cancer.
For example, in a randomized phase 2 trial in
untreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer comparing oxaliplatin alone, 5-FU alone, and
5-FU combined with oxaliplatin, no responses were
observed in the single-agent arms but there was a
response rate of 11% and a median survival duration
of 8.5 months for patients randomized to the combined arm. Second-line treatment with the OXFU
regimen was then offered to patients progressing after single-agent treatment. Eighteen of 32 patients
treated in the single-agent arms received the OXFU
combination in second-line treatment. There was no
objective response and 3 patients (17%) had disease
stabilization.15
These previous results were sufficiently compelling to lead us to conduct a phase 2 study to evaluate
the efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with capecitabine (XELOX) in gemcitabine-pretreated patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility Criteria
Patients with histologically confirmed locally
advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma or carcinoma) who had received only 1 prior
chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine, gemcitabinecontaining regimens, or investigational regimen)
were enrolled in the study. Chemotherapy used as a
radiation sensitizer or given in an adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting was permitted if it was administered
>6 months before study entry. Other eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) PS of 0 to 2 and adequate hepatic, renal, and

bone marrow function (leukocyte count 3000/lL,
an absolute neutrophil count 1500/uL, platelet count
 100,000/lL, total bilirubin 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal [ULN], aspartate/
alanine aminotransferase levels 2.5 times the institutional ULN, and creatinine 1.5 mg/dL). Patients
were not eligible for the study if they had previously
received oxaliplatin or capecitabine, had gastrointestinal dysfunction that caused moderate to severe
(grade 2) diarrhea, or were unable to take oral
medications. Patients with uncontrolled concurrent
illnesses, known brain metastasis, known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, extensive
lung fibrosis, peripheral neuropathy (grade 1), or
receiving therapeutic doses of warfarin for anticoagulation were excluded. The Institutional Review Board
approved this study protocol and all patients were
required to provide written informed consent.

Treatment and Dose Modifications
Oxaliplatin (Sanofi-Aventis, Collegeville, Penn) was
given intravenously on Day 1 as a 120-minute infusion and capecitabine (Roche, Nutley, NJ) was administered orally twice daily for 14 days to patients
with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. A cycle of therapy was
defined as 21 days. Tumor restaging was performed
every 9 weeks. In patients aged <65 years and with
an ECOG PS <2, the oxaliplatin dose was 130 mg/m2
and the capecitabine dose was 1000 mg/m2 twice
daily (total daily dose of 2000 mg/m2). In patients
aged >65 years, or with PS of 2, or having significant
comorbidities as determined by the treating physician, the initial oxaliplatin dose was 110 mg/m2 and
the capecitabine starting dose was 750 mg/m2 twice
daily (total daily dose 1500 mg/m2). These dose
adjustments were mandated for safety reasons
because patients with progressive disease on frontline therapy may have declining PS or face multiple
symptoms, potentially increasing the risk of toxicity
with full-dose cytotoxic therapy. Treatment was continued until occurrence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient elected to discontinue
study participation.
Dose modifications and treatment delays were
based on observed drug-related toxicity. At the start
of subsequent cycles of therapy, the oxaliplatin dose
was reduced by 25% for neutropenic fever, grade 3-4
hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity, and for
grade 2 neurotoxicity. During a cycle of therapy and
for subsequent cycles of therapy, the capecitabine
dose was reduced by 25% for febrile neutropenia, for
grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, and grade 2 hand–
foot syndrome. If a patient experienced laryngophar-

yngeal dysesthesias, subsequent doses of oxaliplatin
were to be administered as 6-hour infusions (instead
of the normal 2-hour infusion). For grade 3 or 4
acute hypersensitivity reactions secondary to oxaliplatin, treatment was discontinued. The capecitabine
dose was reduced by 50% for grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity or grade 3 hand/foot syndrome. Two dose
reductions were allowed for each drug. If a third
reduction was required, continuation of treatment
was at the discretion of the investigator if it was
considered to be in the best interest of the patient.

Evaluation During Study and Response Assessment
Evaluations before and during treatment consisted of
a complete medical history and physical examination; assessment of ECOG PS; laboratory studies,
including hematologic and biochemical profiles;
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis or other
body areas with disease involvement; and chest Xray. Tumor measurement (CT or MRI) was performed
every 3 cycles (9 weeks). Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria were applied
for tumor measurement in patients with measurable
disease, although the presence of measurable disease
was not an entry criterion. Patients’ toxicities were
evaluated at each clinic visit before a new cycle of
treatment. In addition, patients were asked to document toxicities and concurrent medications in a
diary and a research nurse or designee contacted
patients at least once a week for assessment of toxicity. Toxicity was graded using the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC; version 2). Survival duration was measured from the
initiation of therapy to death or to the last follow-up
assessment.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this trial was to determine
the overall survival at 6 months. Because at the intiation of the study there was no established survival
data for patients who have failed 1 treatment for
pancreatic cancer, survival data from a published
phase 2 study in a similar clinical setting was used.
Based on prior phase 2 trials, patients who failed
prior chemotherapy had a 6-month survival rate of
0.3% and a median survival of 3.4 months. This trial
was sized to be able to discriminate between a 6month survival rate of 0.3% and 0.5% and the appropriate sample size was estimated to be 40 patients.
The method of Thall and Simon16 was used to
perform continuous interim monitoring for efficacy.
Accrual was not to be suspended for this monitoring;
data were analyzed as they accrued. We used the his-

torical 6-month survival rate of 0.3 as a reference for
computing the stopping rule. In this way, we would
avoid a high probability of stopping if the true success rate was 0.2. The rule suggested that we will
stop the study if at any time during the study we
determine there is <1% chance that the surviving
proportion with the new treatment is greater than
the historical rate. We assumed a uniform prior distribution (ie, beta1) for the surviving proportion for
the new treatment and this distribution was updated
as data accrued. Using this rule, we would stop the
study if the surviving proportion ([number surviving]/[number evaluated]) was not greater than 0 of
10, 1 of 17, 2 of 23, 3 of 28, 4 of 33, or 5 of 38. Computer simulations were run to determine the operating characteristics of this rule. The probability of
early stopping was 99% for a true surviving proportion of 0.05, 88% for 0.1, 31% for 0.2, and 6% for 0.3.
The principal investigator reviewed survival data
each month to determine whether the above parameters for stopping the study had been met. After the
first 6 months the patients were followed every 3
months for survival.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 41 patients were enrolled in the study from
January 9, 2004 to December 6, 2005. Two patients
dropped out before therapy (1 patient was unable to
take pills and 1 required warfarin anticoagulation).
Among the 39 patients who received treatment and
were evaluable for toxicity and survival, 17 were
women, 20 patients had an ECOG PS of 0 to 1
(71.4%), and the median age was 62 years (range, 4576 years). Eighteen of 39 patients initiated chemo-

therapy at a reduced dose because of age >65 years
or PS of 2. Time from the original diagnosis to enrollment in the current study was 36.7 weeks (8.6
months). Sixteen patients had undergone prior pancreaticoduodenectomy or pancreatectomy with recurrence of disease and 3 patients had undergone
palliative bypass surgeries. The characteristics of the
39 evaluable patients are presented in Table 1.

Treatment Compliance and Toxicities
A total of 108 cycles were delivered with a median of
3 cycles per patient (range, 1-8 cycles). Twenty-one
patients completed 3 cycles of treatment. The most
common reason for discontinuation was disease progression (21 patients; 54%) followed by drug-related
toxicity (8 patients; 21%). Dose reductions were
required in 6 of 39 (15%) patients because of nonhematologic toxicities. Table 2 lists the common nonhematologic treatment-related toxicities.
Efficacy
One of 39 patients (2.6%) had a partial response at
initial tumor assessment and 10 patients (26%) had
stable disease. Progression-free survival was 9.9
weeks (95% CI, 9.6-14.5 weeks). The median overall
survival was 23 weeks (95% CI, 17.0-31.0 weeks) (Fig.
1). The 6-month overall survival was 44% (95% CI,
31%-62%) and the 1-year overall survival was 21%
(95% CI, 11%-38%).
Baseline CA 19-9 data were available for all 39
evaluable patients and the median CA 19-9 U/mL
level was 727.5 (range, 4-19,012). Univariate regression analysis was performed and there was no correlation noted between baseline CA 19-9 and
progression-free survival.

DISCUSSION
In the majority of patients, pancreatic cancer
remains a chemoresistant cancer and doublet combination regimens have produced, at best, marginal
results over single-agent gemcitabine. The median
survival with best supportive care in patients who
have failed gemcitabine therapy is approximately
2 months.17,18 Approximately half of the patients
with gemcitabine-pretreated disease may be candidates for further treatment. Several clinical trials
have evaluated the efficacy of salvage chemotherapeutic regimens in gemcitabine-pretreated patients
and the survival duration is in the range of 3 to
8 months (Table 3).19–30
The present study evaluated the combination of
oxaliplatin with capecitabine in patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer who had progressed on
first-line gemcitabine-based therapy. Treatment was

well tolerated and resulted in a median overall survival of 23 weeks with a 6-month survival rate of
44%. A higher–than–usual number of patients (41%)
enrolled in this trial had presented initially with localized disease and underwent surgical resection, subsequently developing metastases. Of the 11 patients
with a partial response or stable disease, 9 had a PS
of 0 to 1, 7 patients had responded to prior gemcitabine, 5 patients had locally advanced pancreatic
cancer, 6 patients had prior cisplatin exposure, and
5 patients had undergone a pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy followed by recurrence
of their cancer.
In a recent report, patients from a Cancer and
Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial were followed for
their natural history and therapies after gemcitabine
failure in advanced pancreatic cancer.31 Older
patients and those with a poorer ECOG PS were less
likely to receive postprogression therapy. However,
even when considered in total, 28% of the patients
died within 4 weeks of developing disease progression on first-line therapy, suggesting that any meaningful improvement in survival with a second-line
therapy is important. The study also noted that only
1.4% of the patients received further experimental
treatment. This may be a reflection of nihilism
among clinicians, but also suggests that there is a
need to encourage previously treated patients to
enroll in second-line trials.
The clinical factors that may help select patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer who will benefit
most from second-line therapy are good PS, previous
response to first-line therapy (suggesting a chemoresponsiveness trait), and recurrence after their pancreatectomy, especially those with a long disease-free
interval (suggesting a better tumor biology).

XELOX in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer/Xiong et al

We believe that given the manageable toxicity,
XELOX has a role in selected good PS patients with
gemcitabine-pretreated advanced pancreatic cancer.
We recognize that only with randomized phase 2 and
3 trials stratified for prognostic factors (PS, time to
disease progression on first-line therapy, and history
of previous surgery) can we define the benefit of second-line chemotherapy. Furthermore, better understanding of validated prediction markers will provide
new opportunities to optimize the management of
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
