BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug with effects on the immune system that may enhance antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and reverse tumor-induced immune suppression. Furthermore, single-agent lenalidomide has
therapeutic activity in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas. These immunologic effects potentially may enhance the action of rituximab. METHODS: To test the efficacy of lenalidomide combined with rituximab, the authors conducted a phase 2 trial of lenalidomide,
low-dose dexamethasone, and rituximab in patients who had rituximab-resistant, relapsed/refractory, indolent B-cell or mantle cell
lymphomas. Patients received two 28-day treatment cycles of lenalidomide 10 mg daily and dexamethasone 8 mg once weekly (part
I). During cycle 3, 4 weekly doses of rituximab 375 mg/m2 were administered with lenalidomide-dexamethasone (part II). After the
part II response assessment, stable or responding patients continued to receive lenalidomide-dexamethasone. RESULTS: Twentyseven patients with follicular (n 5 18), mantle cell (n 5 5), small lymphocytic (n 5 3), and marginal zone (n 5 1) lymphomas started therapy; 3 of 27 patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events and were not evaluable for response. For 24 patients, the overall response rate after part I was 29% (4 patients had a complete response [CR] or CR unconfirmed, and 3 patients had a partial
response), and the overall response rate after part II was 58% (8 patients had a CR, and 6 patients had a partial response). For 27
patients, at a median follow-up of 12.2 months, the median progression-free survival was 23.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of lenalidomide, low-dose dexamethasone, and rituximab achieved high response rates with durable responses in patients with
rituximab-resistant, indolent B-cell and mantle cell lymphomas. Overall response rate increased from 29% after two 28-day cycles of
lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone to 58% after the addition of rituximab, suggesting that lenalidomide can overcome resistC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy improves clinical outcomes for patients with low-grade B-cell lymphomas,
and the inclusion of rituximab in treatment regimens is considered the standard of care for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.1,2 Unfortunately, many patients who receive rituximab-chemotherapy or rituximab monotherapy eventually relapse
and develop resistance to rituximab or to rituximab-containing combination therapies. In our experience, the 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients with low-grade follicular lymphoma who fail to respond to or develop resistance to rituximab
or a rituximab-containing treatment regimen is 58%,3 which is markedly decreased compared with the reported survival
for all patients with follicular lymphoma.4 Thus, there is considerable incentive to overcome resistance to rituximab.
Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug with effects on the immune system that may enhance antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and reverse tumor-induced immune suppression.5,6 These immunologic effects
could potentially enhance the action of rituximab. Furthermore, single-agent lenalidomide has demonstrated therapeutic
activity in relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas,7,8 including follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.9,10

Lenalidomide-Rituximab for NHL/Ahmadi et al

Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential
for synergy between lenalidomide and rituximab, both in
vitro and in murine B-cell lymphoma models.5,11–13 In
vitro, after pretreatment with lenalidomide, rituximab
produced more growth inhibition11 and greater apoptosis
compared with rituximab alone.11,12 This combination
also demonstrably enhanced the natural killer cell,
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of rituximab.12,13
To test the efficacy of lenalidomide combined with
rituximab, we conducted a phase 2 clinical trial in patients
with indolent B-cell or mantle cell lymphomas who were
previously resistant or refractory to rituximab or
rituximab-based therapy. Low-dose, weekly dexamethasone was added to the regimen based on anecdotal clinical
experience suggesting the amelioration of lenalidomide
side effects, especially rash and tumor flare, as well as the
known synergy between corticosteroids and immunomodulatory drugs.14
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a single-center, prospective, open-label, phase 2
study examining the combination of lenalidomide, lowdose dexamethasone, and rituximab in patients with
previously treated, rituximab-refractory or resistant, indolent B-cell or mantle cell lymphomas. The study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review
board of the University of Pennsylvania. All patients
provided written informed consent before study
entry. The clinical trial registration number was
NCT00783367 (available at: clinicaltrials.gov) under the
approved registry name “Combination Therapy Using
Lenalidomide (Revlimid)–Low-Dose Dexamethasone
and Rituximab for Treatment of Rituximab-Resistant,
Nonaggressive B-Cell Lymphomas.”
Adults (aged 18 years) with histologically confirmed, CD20 antigen-expressing follicular (grades 1, 2,
and 3a), marginal zone, small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic, or mantle cell lymphomas were eligible. Tissue
blocks were reviewed to confirm each diagnosis using the
2008 World Health Organization classification criteria.15
Patients were required to have progressive lymphoma
requiring therapy, a life expectancy >3 months, and at
least 1 measurable lesion (2 cm in greatest dimension).
The criteria to initiate treatment on protocol required
patients to have refractory or progressive lymphoma
(defined as new lesions or enlargement 50% of existing
lesions) within 6 months of rituximab monotherapy or a
rituximab-chemotherapy combination. All images and
response assessments were reviewed by the principal invesCancer

tigator and a board-certified radiologist. Patients were
withdrawn from the study if they experienced relapse or
disease progression after having received rituximab or at
the discretion of the treating physician or patient.
In part I of protocol therapy, patients received oral
lenalidomide 10 mg daily and oral dexamethasone 8 mg
once weekly for two 28-day cycles. Response evaluation
(computed tomography [CT] or positron emission tomography/CT imaging) was performed at the end of the
second cycle (part I response). Patients then initiated part
II of protocol therapy—cycles 3 through 5—regardless of
their response status after part I. During cycle 3, in addition to continuous daily lenalidomide and weekly dexamethasone, patients received rituximab 375 mg/m2 once
weekly for 4 weeks. Radiologic response was reassessed 2
months after completing rituximab at the end of cycle 5
(part II response). Patients who demonstrated either a
response or stable disease were permitted to continue
receiving lenalidomide with or without dexamethasone
until they developed disease progression or withdrew, but
patients were not permitted to receive additional rituximab while on study (Fig. 1). Patients who continued
receiving lenalidomide had CT or PET/CT imaging at 12
months, 18 months, and 24 months after enrollment and
then yearly for a maximum of 5 years from study entry.
Lenalidomide was held for toxicity grade 3 based on version 3 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, and it was restarted at
a lower dose (either 5 mg daily or every other day) upon
the resolution of toxicity ( grade 2) within 28 days. At
the discretion of the treating physician, the dose of oral
lenalidomide could also be decreased to 5 mg daily or 5
mg every other day for lower grade symptoms possibly
related to lenalidomide. All patients received either aspirin
81 mg daily or warfarin for antithrombotic prophylaxis.
Contraceptive counseling was performed according to the
RevAssist program (Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ).
The primary study endpoint was the overall response
rate (ORR) after cycle 5 (part II response) using international workshop response criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.16 For 25 evaluable patients, using an a value of
.05, we estimated 80% power to detect an ORR of at least
50%. Secondary clinical endpoints included progressionfree survival (PFS),16 response duration (RD)16/time to
progression (TTP),17 OS,16 and a detailed toxicity assessment using version 3 of the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS, RD/TTP,
and OS. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA
version 9.2 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex).

Patient Characteristics

Twenty-seven patients were enrolled between July 2008
and May 2010. Prior to enrollment, 19 patients had disease progression after or during rituximab, 6 patients had
stable disease after rituximab, and 2 patients relapsed
within 6 months of responding to rituximab. The median
time from diagnosis was 6.77 years (range, 0.89-26.12
years). Additional characteristics of the study cohort at
enrollment are presented in Table 1.
Response Assessment and Survival Analysis

For any patient who received at least 1 dose of lenalidomide (N 5 27), the ORR after part I was 26%, and the
ORR after part II for all 27 patients who started protocol
therapy, even if they did not receive rituximab, was 52%.
There was no difference in the response rate between
patients whose rituximab resistance-defining therapy was
a rituximab-chemotherapy combination, rituximab
monotherapy, or rituximab maintenance (P 5 .4).
Twenty-four of 27 patients received rituximab during cycle 3 and were evaluable for response to part I (2
cycles of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone) and
part 2 (lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in
224

cycles 3-5 with rituximab during cycle 3). After part I, the
ORR for these 24 patients was 29% (complete response
[CR]/CR unconfirmed [CRu] rate, 17%); the ORRs were
20% for follicular lymphoma (3 of 15 patients), 60% for
mantle cell lymphoma (3 of 5 patients), 33% for small
lymphocytic lymphoma (1 of 3 patients), and 0% for
marginal zone lymphoma (0 of 1 patient). After part II,
the ORR for these 24 patients was 58% (CR rate, 33%);
the ORRs were 53% for follicular lymphoma (8 of 15
patients), 60% for mantle cell lymphoma (3 of 5 patients),
67% for small lymphocytic lymphoma (2 of 3 patients),
and 100% for marginal zone lymphoma (1 of 1 patient).
Nine of 24 patients (38%) demonstrated an improvement
in protocol-defined response after receiving rituximab.
Nineteen of 24 patients (75%) continued to receive lenalidomide and weekly dexamethasone after the completion
of cycle 5. Of 14 patients who had stable disease or a partial response (PR) after completing 4 weekly doses of rituximab (part II response assessment), only 1 patient had a
further improvement in response status during follow-up.
As of November 10, 2012, the median follow-up was
12.2 months (range, 0.9-52.7 months), and the estimated

median PFS and OS were 23.7 months and not reached,
respectively (Fig. 2A). The RD/TTP for responding
patients was 26.6 months (Fig. 2B). The percentage
change in the sum of the products of the maximum perpendicular, cross-sectional dimensions of target lesions in
individual patients after part I (lenalidomide-dexamethasone) and part II (lenalidomide-dexamethasone-rituximab) are illustrated shown in Figure 3A through C.
Safety

The most common adverse event attributed to lenalidomide was a mild change in bowel habits, usually increased
frequency, which did not warrant discontinuation of therapy (grade 1). The reported grade 3 or 4 treatment-related
adverse events were neutropenia (8 of 27 patients; 30%),
leukopenia (4 of 27 patients; 15%), hypokalemia (4 of 27
patients; 15%), anemia (2 of 27 patients; 7%), hypophosphatemia (2 of 27 patients; 7%), thrombocytopenia (2 of
27 patients; 7%), transaminase elevation (1 of 27 patients;
4%), pneumonia (1 of 27 patients; 4%), diarrhea (1 of 27
patients; 4%), fatigue (1 of 27 patients; 4%), rash (1 of 27
patients; 4%), tumor flare (1 of 27 patients; 4%), pulmonary embolism (1 of 27 patients; 4%), and hyperuricemia
(1 of 27 patients; 4%). Four patients (15%) had adverse
events that led to discontinuation of therapy, including 3
who discontinued before part I response assessment (myocarditis, rash, thrombocytopenia) and 1 patient who discontinued after the part II response assessment (second
malignancy). Four patients (15%) had treatment interruptions and dose reductions secondary to toxicity
(thrombocytopenia, transaminase elevation, neutropenia,
and tumor flare). One death from myocarditis occurred

DISCUSSION
In this study, patients with indolent B-cell or mantle cell
lymphomas who were previously resistant to rituximabbased therapy received combined lenalidomide, low-dose
dexamethasone, and rituximab. The ORR and the CR
rate, as well as the TTP, were superior to the results
reported for retreatment with single-agent rituximab in
patients who were not selected for rituximab resistance.17
Although the ORR increased from 29% after 2
cycles of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone to
58% after the addition of rituximab, based on the design
of this single-arm trial, it was not possible to determine
with certainty whether rituximab improved what would
have been the response to further continuation of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone alone. However, of
20 patients who ultimately had reductions in tumor volume on this regimen, 7 patients initially had increases in
their tumor volumes before the addition of rituximab
(Fig. 3A). This suggests a response to rituximab in these
patients. In addition, of the other 13 patients who ultimately had a reduction in tumor volume on this regimen,
12 had further reductions in tumor volume after receiving
rituximab, which also suggests enhanced efficacy for the
rituximab combination over lenalidomide plus low-dose
dexamethasone alone (Fig. 3A). Although a few patients
had CRs after receiving lenalidomide alone, both the timing and the magnitude of responses after the addition of
rituximab in these previously rituximab-resistant patients

suggest that the addition of rituximab to lenalidomide
improved responses over lenalidomide plus low-dose
dexamethasone alone.
To our, knowledge, this study is the first to describe
the efficacy of combination lenalidomide, low-dose dexamethasone, and rituximab both in patients who were uniformly documented as resistant to rituximab and in
patients with low-grade follicular lymphoma. Rituximab
226

is a cornerstone of treatment for low-grade follicular lymphoma, and patients with rituximab-refractory, low-grade
follicular lymphoma have poorer OS compared with all
patients diagnosed with follicular lymphoma.3,4 Treatment with lenalidomide plus rituximab appears to be well
tolerated and effective in patients with indolent B-cell and
mantle cell lymphomas and may offer another therapeutic
option for previously treated patients who have a poor

prognosis. Lenalidomide also has the advantage of being
an oral formulation. In addition, lenalidomide can be
continued for years in the absence of cytopenias; the longest patient we report on has received lenalidomide for
over 4 years. Moreover, in our experience, combination
lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and rituximab did not interfere with the ability to administer subsequent chemotherapy.
The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab
reportedly is effective in relapsed or refractory, aggressive
B-cell lymphomas, including mantle cell lymphoma
(ORR, 57%)19; relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell,
follicular grade 3, and transformed lymphomas (ORR,
33%)20; and de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(ORR, 35%).21 These trials differ from our study, in that
they used a different dose and schedule of lenalidomide
(oral lenalidomide 20 mg daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day
cycle19–21) as well as different schedules for rituximab
administration (rituximab weekly for cycle 119,20 or rituximab every other week for 4 cycles21); thus, those response
rates are not directly comparable to our results.
In conclusion, we report the first clinical trial of
combined lenalidomide, low-dose dexamethasone, and
rituximab in patients with rituximab-resistant, indolent Bcell lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. Our data support other reports of efficacy for rituximab-lenalidomide
in relapsed19–23 and previously untreated, indolent B-cell
lymphoma24 and, in part, are the basis for an ongoing
multicenter, randomized trial comparing lenalidomiderituximab with rituximab-chemotherapy as first-line therapy of follicular lymphoma (NCT01476787).
