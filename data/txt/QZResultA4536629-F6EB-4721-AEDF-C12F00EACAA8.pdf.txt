ABSTRACT
Our previous data demonstrated profound anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects
of p62 (sqstm1) DNA vaccine in rodents with various types of transplantable tumors.
Testing anti-cancer medicine in dogs as an intermediary step of translational research
program provides two major benefits. First, clinical data collected in target animals
is required for FDA/USDA approval as a veterinary anti-cancer drug or vaccine. It
is noteworthy that the veterinary community is in need of novel medicine for the
prevention and treatment of canine and feline cancers. The second more important
benefit of testing anti-cancer vaccines in dogs is that spontaneous tumors in dogs
may provide invaluable information for human trials. Here, we evaluated the effect(s)
of p62 DNA vaccine on mammary tumors of dogs. We found that p62 DNA vaccine
administered i.m. decreased or stabilized growth of locally advanced lesions in
absence of its overall toxic effects. The observed antitumor activity was associated
with lymphocyte infiltration and tumor encapsulation via fibrotic reaction. This data
justifies both human clinical trials and veterinary application of p62 DNA vaccine.

INTRODUCTION

Spontaneous cancers observed in dogs have
clear advantages as compared to mouse cancers—like
human cancers, they occur naturally, are histologically
comparable, and respond similarly to anti-cancer therapy
[1]. For many gene families, most notably those associated
with cancer, the similarities between a dog and human
are significantly closer than those between a mouse and
human [2]. As the pets live longer due to a better care, the
prevalence of cancer in them increases, as also happens
in the human population. Importantly, whereas the
assessment of disease-free interval or survival in human
clinical trials usually takes several years, getting similar
information from clinical trials in dogs generally takes
much less time, just a few months in some cases.

Most of the current research on human cancer
mechanisms and treatments are conducted using mice.
Mouse models of cancer have several advantages—they
can be rapidly propagated, are inexpensive, etc. However,
they have essential limitations: while tumors in humans
arouse spontaneously, in mice they must be induced by
environmental toxins or genetic modifications. In the
latter case, it usually involves just one or a few genes,
whereas most human cancers are polygenic in origin;
therefore, mouse models of cancer are lacking vast gene
networks and interactions which are responsible for cancer
in humans [1].

The latest trend in biotechnology is to test drugs
and vaccines in companion animals prior to initiating
human clinical trials [3]. For instance, anti-tumor activity
of an immune stimulator, liposomal muramyltripeptide
phosphatidylethanolamine (L-MPT-PE) was first
demonstrated in dogs with osteosarcoma. Later human
trials produced remarkably similar results to those of
the canine studies [4], which finally lead to approval of
L-MPT-PE (MEPACT) for osteosarcoma in children
in Europe. Another important example is development
of a DNA vaccine for melanoma in dogs; this vaccine
(Oncept®) was the first DNA anti-cancer vaccine
approved, and its efficiency and safety led to ongoing
clinical trials in patients with melanoma.
DNA vaccines, as compared to traditional vaccines,
have several advantages: they can induce both humoral
and cellular immunity; they are safe, inexpensive and
stable; and, they can be easily modified to enhance
immune response [5, 6]. Accordingly, there are about 50
ongoing clinical trials which use DNA vaccines for cancer
treatment (clinical trials.gov).
We have recently developed an anti-cancer DNA
vaccine based on p62 (SQSTM1) [7].The р62 protein is a
major player in selective macroautophagy [8] and serves as
a signaling hub for several signal transduction pathways,
among them NF-kB, TRAF6, MAP kinases, etc. [9], [10,
11]. Importantly, p62 is dispensable for normal tissues,
but essential for development and survival of tumors
(see [6] for review ). At least in several mouse models
studied, knockout of p62 prevented or markedly delayed
development of cancer caused by several oncogenes.
Furthermore, fully transformed cells do not lose their
dependence on p62 since its downregulation causes
inhibition of growth or loss of viability [10]. Thus, tumors,
in contrast to normal tissues, become “addicted” to p62,
a phenomenon known as “non-oncogene addiction” [12].
Importantly, according to data of Oncomine (the largest
database of human cancer microarrays) and other reports,
at least 10 various types of human cancer have high levels
of p62 as compared to normal tissues [10].
Based on these considerations, we have chosen p62
as an antigen for a DNA vaccine, which was evaluated for
its anti-tumor effects. In studies of hundreds of animals
with allogeneic tumors, p62 vaccine has proven its
effectiveness in four types of solid tumors in mice and
rats: melanoma, sarcoma, lung and breast carcinomas [7].
More importantly, it also possessed strong anti-metastatic
activity in three models of metastatic disease: spontaneous
metastases to lung (Lewis lung carcinoma), spontaneous
metastases to regional lymph nodes (sarcoma-37), and
induced metastases (by I.V. injection) in B16 melanoma.
We also found that, at least in case of lung carcinoma
and melanoma, p62 vaccine decreased both the number
and the size of metastasis, indicating that it suppresses
colonization of lung by tumor cells (e.g., formation of
micro-metastases), as well as growth of established
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metastases. In mouse and rat breast carcinomas we also
observed, besides tumor growth inhibition, an increase
in mean survival by 50-60% ([7] and unpublished data).
Based on these rodent data, we decided to move forward
to more appropriate clinical models of human cancer,
spontaneous canine mammary tumors, and performed a
pilot study of efficacy and toxicity of p62 DNA vaccine.
Mammary tumors are the most common tumors
of unspayed female dogs with a prevalence of 40% of
all tumors, and about half of them are malignant [13].
The major treatment of mammary cancers in dogs is
mastectomy, but since the tumors are usually diagnosed
at later stages, often surgery cannot be performed and its
effect on survival is limited, with medium survival time
of only 7-9 months in dogs with stage III tumors [14].
As of now, there is no proven efficacy of any radio- or
chemotherapeutic protocol for the treatment of malignant
mammary canine tumors, and no immunotherapy for these
tumors is available.
Here, we demonstrated that p62-based DNA vaccine
is an efficacious and safe treatment of mammary tumors
in dogs.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Acute Toxicity in Rodents
Before performing chronic toxicity assays in dogs,
we have assessed acute toxicity in mice, rats and guinea
pigs. Our previous experiments in mice demonstrated that
anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity was the highest
at the minimal therapeutic dose (TD) of 0.1-0.15 mg per
mouse (i.e., 5-7.5 mg/kg, 3 or 5 times once a week) [7].
Accordingly, the animals were once treated i.m. with 1
or 50 (TD) of the vaccine (1 TD for rats was taken as
7.5 mg/kg, and for guinea pigs – 9.4 mg/kg). Both doses
of vaccine were well tolerated and, under autopsy, no
apparent pathological changes in organs and tissues were
found (data not shown).

Chronic Toxicity in Rats
A chronic toxicity study was first performed in rats.
Rats were administered 1, 5, or 50 TD of the vaccine i.m.
once a day for 90 days. All animals survived the treatments
and biochemical analysis of their blood did not reveal
any toxic effects on heart, kidney and hemostasis (data
not shown). There were no negative effects on the rats’
behavior or, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism; and, there
was no hepatotoxicity except transient mild impairment
of liver barrier functions (on day 3). Macroscopic and
histological examination after autopsy did not reveal any
gross pathological changes (data not shown).

Chronic Toxicity in Healthy Dogs

Toxicity in Tumor-bearing Dogs

Based on the above data about minimal chronic
toxicity of p62 DNA vaccine in rodents, we tested its
chronic toxicity in dogs. There were no visual signs of
intoxications with 5 TD or 50 TD doses (0.1 mg/kg or 1
mg/kg, respectively) during all periods of observation (90
days), although there was a slight (about 10%) decrease in
body mass. Hematological analysis revealed a moderate
(1.5-2 times) increase in leukocyte numbers, a decrease
in lymphocyte numbers, and an increase in thrombocyte
numbers (1.5-2 times). Biochemical analysis revealed
transient reversible changes in liver functions, similar
to rats, and there were no effects on the pancreas and
carbohydrate metabolism. Also, no effects on cardiac
functions (by ECG) were found. Under autopsy, there
were some destructive-dystrophic changes found in
kidneys, hypofunction of thyroid and adrenal gland, and
a decrease in macrophages in spleen, but these anatomical
changes apparently did not cause significant changes in
homeostasis (data will be provided on request).
Based on these data, we concluded that the doses
of p62 DNA vaccine employed (aproximately 1-10
mg per 10-20 kg animal) can be safely administered to
dogs. In contrast to cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs where
the therapeutic dose strongly depends on mass and rate
of metabolism, such dependence for DNA vaccines is not
straightforward. Therefore, for this pilot study we chose
doses of 0.75 -2.5 mg per dog.

Similar to healthy dogs, we did not find apparent
drug-associated toxicity in dogs with mammary cancer
when the animals were administered vaccine doses
ranging from 0.75 to 2.5 mg per dog. During the treatment
(3-10 injections once a week), their weight remained
unchanged or slightly increased, and their well-being did
not deteriorate. No significant differences were found in
hematological and biochemical parameters during the
treatment as compared to those before treatment (data will
be provided on request). Taken together, our toxicity data
demonstrates that p62 DNA vaccine is well-tolerated and
possesses no apparent toxicity. This conclusion justifies
further veterinary and clinical studies of p62 DNA vaccine
(see ref [17] for review).

Anti-tumor Activity of p62 DNA Vaccine
The effect of p62 DNA vaccination was evaluated
in seven dogs with mammary tumors. We have observed
similar responses in all tumors—initially, during first 3-5
injections, tumors become enlarged, but then their size
rapidly declined, decreasing in some cases by 50-70%
(Fig.1, Table 2). Such an unusual two-phase response
is not observed in conventional anti-cancer therapy, but
happens in immunotherapy [18] [19]. For instance, tumor
volume increases after the first few doses of ipilimumab
(anti-CTLA4 antibody) administered in humans, but then
it decreases [20]. Importantly, this new pattern of tumor
response was associated with favorable survival prognosis,
12805

Insights in Mechanism of Anti-tumor Activity of
p62 DNA Vaccine

which led to a proposal of improved endpoints of
immunotherapy trials [19]. An increase in tumor volume
observed initially cannot be due to a tumor growth and
propagatoin of cancer cells because it happens too fast.
Instead, it is probably associated with local inflammatory
immune response (see below).
Apparently, p62 DNA vaccine exerted its effects
in two ways: 1) in neoadjuvant settings, it made invasive
and non-resectable tumors resectable (patients #1, 2,
6, 7), and 2) if mastectomy was impossible because of
health concerns or declined by an owner, the treatment
completely stopped tumor growth for the entire duration
of the observation period (patients #4, 5). So far, only
one dog (#3) demonstrated relapse of primary tumor
after 6 months, and it is now undergoing another round
of treatment with the vaccine; all other dogs are currently
either tumor-free (after mastectomy) or have had their
tumors stabilized for 4-22 months (mean = 10 months).
Such prolonged stabilization of tumors without their
disappearance is also characteristic of immunotherapy,
which, in contrast to chemo- or radiotherapy, have
long-lasting effects due to immunological memory. It
may mean, for instance, that immune response arrests
tumor growth, but it is not sufficient for complete tumor
eradication. Smaller size tumor(s) remaining in the body
may not be critical for dog’s well-being even if they never
regress completely. We are still collecting the data on
long-term effects of p62 vaccine and overall survival of
the dogs.

In several mouse tumor models (е.g., [21]) and in
human cancers, in particular breast cancer, lymphocyte
infiltration is regarded as a favorable prognostic factor
indicating enhanced host’s anti-tumor immune response
[22-24]. Since we observed an apparent increase in
tumor volume during the first several injections, we
tested whether this was caused by lymphocyte infiltration
associated with inflammatory immune response. Indeed,
analysis of biopsies before and after treatment with p62
DNA vaccine demonstrated significant infiltration of
monocytes within the neoplasms (Fig.2).
Also, histological sections after mastectomy
obtained from two tumors treated with p62 DNA vaccine
were subjected to immune staining with anti-CD3
antibody specific for T-lymphocytes (including cytotoxic
CD8+ lymphocytes) and compared to the same tumor’s

biopsies before the treatment. As shown in Fig.3, p62
DNA vaccination resulted in a drastic accumulation of
CD3+-positive cells in the tumor as compared to the
control without the treatment. Finally, we found that
p62 DNA vaccination induces profound changes in the
extracellular matrix of mammary neoplasms. As shown in
Fig.4, silver-stained sections of tumors [25] consistently
displayed strong and highly organized tissue proliferation

surrounding and slitting the original neoplastic mass
into smaller tumor islands. This localized desmoplastic
reaction is due to the vaccination because it is not observed
in retrospective review of dozens of untreated dogs with
mammary adenocarcinoma (unpublished data and ref [26]
). However, it remains to be revealed how a thick layer of
stroma surrounding a tumor contributes to prevention of
the tumor growth and spreading.

In addition to the data presented above, we observed
a positive effect of p62 DNA vaccine in feline mammary
tumors, and in other tumors of dogs (e.g., lymphoma)
(manuscript in preparation). Duration of a progressionfree survival and clinical applicability of the p62 DNA
vaccine to different nosologies and stages of disease will
be assessed quantitativly in follow-up studies.
Previously, pre-operative chemo- or radiotherapy
were used as neoadjuvants in patients with early stage
breast cancer. Neoadjuvant therapy, which could be used
for pre-treatment of inoperable tumors to make these
tumors resectable, constitutes an important unsatisfied
niche. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first
report of neoadjuvant application of an antitumor vaccines
(or immunotherapy) in humans or dogs. We observed clear
benefits of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for the dogs which
did not have adjuvant therapy as an available option. In
future studies, we may asses effect(s) of combination(s)
of p62 vaccines with conventional aduvants.

by hematological and biochemical analyses of blood and
for cardiac functions by EKG. Dogs were euthanized 3 or
30 days after full course of injections and their autopsies
were was performed. This study was performed according
to standards of Good Laboratory Practice and guidelines
of Russian Ministry of Health.

Patients and Treatment
Assessment of the therapeutic effect was performed
in three veterinary clinics: Center of Modern Veterinary
Medicine, Kiev (Ukraine), University of Camerino (Italy),
and Municipal Veterinary Clinic, St. Petersburg (Russia).
A total of seven dogs, all females, of different breeds and
ages 9 to 15 yr old (mean = 12 yr) were enrolled in the
study (Table 1). All of them had histologically confirmed
diagnosis of breast carcinoma with WHO stages I-III,
progressive disease, and no options for treatment or other
treatment options were declined by the owners. P62
vaccine was administered i.m. once a weak at the doses of
0.75, 1.0 or 2.5 mg for 3-10 weeks (Table 1). During the
treatment, blood was collected for biochemical analysis,
and the sizes of tumors were measured manually with
calipers. Also the weight and overall well-being of patients
were monitored. All the treatments were performed with
full consent of the owners.

CONCLUSIONS
1. p62 DNA vaccine demonstrated no overall
toxicity in healthy and tumor-bearing dogs, and it is welltolerated by animals without visible side effects.
2. p62 DNA vaccine demonstrated anti-tumor
activity in canine spontaneous mammary tumors leading
to tumor shrinkage and/or stabilization.
3. Along with our previous data on anti-tumor and
anti-metastatic activity of p62 DNA vaccine in allogeneic
tumors in rodents and a comprehensive set of pre-clinical
data, these results justify further clinical development
of p62 DNA vaccine as a veterinary medicine and its
advancement into human clinical trials.

Tumor
Specimens,
Immunohistochemistry

and

Biopsies (Trucut) were performed in all dogs
before treatment to establish initial diagnosis. In two of
them (patients #6 and #7), a second biopsy, along with
samples from resected tumors were collected. Standard
histochemical analysis of connective tissue, Giemsa,
Masson’s Trichome staining, and silver impregnation was
carried out as detailed elsewhere [15].
For immunohistochemistry, sections of the tumors
were deparafinazed and processed as previously described
[16]. CD3+T cells were stained with rat anti-human CD3
monoclonal antibody (Serotec) and Elite ABC-peroxidase
KitsStandard (Vectasain).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
p62 Vaccine
Human p62 (SQSM1, isoform 1) was cloned
in pcDNA3.1 vector. Plasmid DNA was produced by
Aldevron (ND, USA). Quality of plasmid preparation was
assessed by DNA agarose electrophoresis, by sequencing
and by functional assay for p62 activity (Gabai et al, in
preparation).
