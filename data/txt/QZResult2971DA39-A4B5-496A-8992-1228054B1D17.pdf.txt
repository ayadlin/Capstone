Abstract
To improve chemotherapeutic efficacy in urothelial cancer, it
is important to identify predictive markers for chemosensitivity as well as possible molecules accelerating cell killing
mechanisms. In this study, we assessed the possibility of
galectin-7 to accelerate cis -diamminedichloroplatinum
(CDDP)–induced cell killing in vitro and also to predict
chemosensitivity against CDDP in urothelial cancer patients.
The expression of galectin-7 was analyzed in five bladder
cancer cell lines with different p53 status after treatment with
CDDP. The roles of galectin-7 in chemosensitivity against
CDDP were analyzed by transfection of the galectin-7 gene
into several of these cell lines. Furthermore, the relationship
between the expression of galectin-7 and the response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy was analyzed in 17 human bladder
cancer specimens. Exposure to CDDP induced galectin-7 in
cell lines with wild-type p53 but not in those with mutated
p53. When the galectin-7 gene was transfected into cell lines
with mutated p53, the sensitivity to CDDP increased compared
with control transfectants. In addition, galectin-7–transfected
cells exhibited more accumulation of intracellular reactive
oxygen species and activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK) and Bax than control transfectants. SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, or antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibited the
enhancement of chemosensitivity against CDDP by galectin-7
transfection. In clinical samples, the expression levels of
galectin-7 were significantly lower in urothelial carcinomas
compared with normal urothelium. When chemosensitivity
was tested, its expression levels were higher in the chemosensitive group than in the chemoresistant group. Galectin-7
is a candidate for a predictive marker of chemosensitivity
against CDDP, and the targeted expression of galectin-7 might
overcome the chemoresistance of urothelial cancer. [Cancer

Introduction
Urothelial cancer is one of the most common genitourinary
malignancies, in which 20% to 40% are present with or develop
invasive disease (1). Despite radical cystectomy, which is a gold
standard for treatment, about half of patients die from this

aggressive disease within 5 years (2, 3). To improve the prognosis of
invasive bladder cancer, cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy
has been empirically adapted in combination with radical
cystectomy, but the overall response rate has been reported to
vary between 12% and 73% (4, 5). If empirical chemotherapy was
administered for a chemoresistant tumor, some patients suffered
severe adverse effects without achieving any benefit. Therefore, the
importance of detecting molecular markers for chemosensitivity
and modification of chemotherapy to overcome chemoresistance
has risen recently for patients with invasive urothelial cancer.
p53 is a tumor suppressor protein and a regulator of the cell
cycle and apoptosis. Mutation in the p53 gene is one of the most
common genetic events accounting for up to 61% of urothelial
cancers (6, 7). Mutated p53 has been considered to be linked to
cancer progression, prognosis, and response to chemotherapy
(8, 9), although the clinical importance of p53 alterations as a
predicting factor for chemosensitivity remains controversial
(10, 11). Recently, we reported the importance of the p53-p21–
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in chemosensitivity
against cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) in urothelial cancers with wild-type (WT) p53. However, in cancer cells with
mutated p53, we recognized the necessity of other factors to evoke
apoptosis through JNK activation (12). To identify molecules that
enhance the p53 response in RT112 urothelial cancer cells, we then
screened up-regulated genes in response to CDDP in these cells
using microarray analysis and found that galectin-7 mRNA was
induced in RT112 cells by CDDP.
Galectin-7 is a 15-kDa protein with a single carbohydrate
recognition domain and has been reported to be induced by p53
transfection in a human colon carcinoma cell line DLD-1.
Therefore, it is designated as p53-induced gene 1 (PIG1; ref. 13).
It also belongs to a family of h-galactoside–binding animal lectins
consisting of 15 members (galectins 1–15; ref. 14). The expression
of galectin family genes has been reported to be significantly
altered in various kinds of cancers, and these alterations are
considered to contribute to neoplastic transformation and tumor
progression through many biological functions, including cell
growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis (15–18). The expression of
galectin-7 was identified in normal stratified epithelial cells,
including the skin, tongue, esophagus, and Hassal’s corpuscles in
the thymus, and interestingly, it was strikingly down-regulated in
squamous cell carcinoma cells (19). Functionally, the ectopical
expression of galectin-7 in colon carcinoma cells rendered the cells
more sensitive to several apoptotic stimuli through the activation
of JNK (20, 21). These findings suggested that galectin-7 played
important roles in carcinogenesis or chemosensitivity in squamous
cell and colorectal carcinomas, but there were no reports about its

expression in urothelial carcinomas. In the present study, we
investigated the functional significance and clinical usefulness of
galectin-7 in the chemosensitivity of urothelial cancers.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents. Antibodies were obtained as follows: antiJNK, phospho-JNK, phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), Bax, and caspase-9 were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti–caspase-3 and caspase8 were from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA); anti–poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP; C2-10) and Bax (6A7) were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO);
anti-p53 (Ab-2) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); anti–Bcl-2 and p21
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and anti–actin h was
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). An antibody against galectin-7 (polyclonal
goat serum) was produced as described previously (20). SP600125 was
purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Bristol, United Kingdom) as a JNK
inhibitor, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was from Calbiochem. CDDP was
from Wako (Osaka, Japan).
Cell lines. Five bladder tumor-derived cell lines were used. Four bladder
(RT112, TCCsup, EJ, and J82) cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. RT4 was maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37jC
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. cDNA sequencing and
genotyping of p53 were done in the manner described previously (22).
Briefly, cDNA of p53 synthesized from total RNA of each cell line was
amplified by PCR with recombinant Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA) and directly sequenced using oligonucleotide primers. Cycle sequencing
reactions were carried out using Big Dye Terminator chemistry (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Bladder cancer tissues and normal urothelium. Clinical tissue
samples were obtained from 17 patients suffering from bladder cancer
with extravesical invasion (cT3 or greater) who received preoperative
systemic chemotherapy and cystectomy between January 2000 and
December 2003 at Kyoto University. All samples were obtained by cold
cup biopsy before treatment and immediately homogenized with RLT lysis
buffer of RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and stored at
80jC until RNA extraction. As preoperative chemotherapy, patients
received two cycles of MEC chemotherapy, which included cisplatin,
methotrexate, and epidoxorubicin treatments. In general, preoperative
chemotherapy was indicated for invasive bladder cancer more than cT3,
and the present study included only cases, in which responses to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be evaluated by radiologic examinations.
The patients were classified into two groups, responders and nonresponders, based on the reduction ratio of the primary tumor volume
after two cycles of chemotherapy: the former group including complete
response (CR) and partial response (PR) and the latter including no change
and progressive disease (PD), respectively. The clinical and pathologic
classifications, both including tumor grade and stage, were assessed
according to the WHO system and tumor-node-metastasis classifications,
respectively (23).
Human normal urothelium was collected at the time of nephrectomy
conducted in diseases other than urothelial carcinomas as described
previously (24), and RNA was extracted in the same way as from bladder
cancer tissues.
Generation of stable transfectants. pEF1-galectin-7, which encodes
galectin-7 cDNA, was constructed as described previously (20). Three
bladder cancer cell lines, RT112, TCCsup, and EJ, were transfected with
pEF1-galectin-7 or control vector pEF1-neo using LipofectAMINE 2000 and
Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc. Grand Island, NY) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Stable transfectants were selected by G418
resistance (Calbiochem). When numerous G418-resistant colonies
appeared, the cells in the colonies were mixed and stored in liquid nitrogen
until used for studies. The cells were used in experiments within 2 weeks
after thawing.
A dominant-negative mutant of p53 (p53DN) containing one missense
mutation at codon 135 (TGC ! TAC), which was purchased from BD

www.aacrjournals.org

Biosciences (San Diego, CA), was ligated into pCMVneo, a kind gift of
Dr. K. Cho (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). RT112
cells were transfected with pCMVneo or pCMV-p53DN using LipofectAMINE following the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable transfectants were
selected by G418 resistance. Overexpression of p53DN was confirmed by
sequencing, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), or Western blot analysis.
Drug treatment. For dose-response and time course studies, cells were
grown to 70% to 80% confluency in 100-mm dishes for 48 h and treated with
CDDP at the corresponding concentrations of IC50. IC50s of CDDP were 20
and 40 Amol/L in RT4 and RT112, respectively, whereas those of TCCsup, EJ,
and J82 were >100 Amol/L. For analysis of the JNK pathway, cells were
treated with 40 Amol/L SP600125 dissolved in DMSO following exposure to
CDDP.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared from culture cells
and clinical samples using the RNeasy mini kit. First-strand cDNA was
synthesized from 1 to 5 Ag total RNA using random primers according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Primer sequences used for galectin-7
cDNA amplification were as follows: 5¶-ATGTCCAACGTCCCCCACAAG-3¶
(sense) and 5¶-TGACGCGATGATGAGCACCTC-3¶ (antisense), resulting in a
282-bp fragment. Primers for amplification of the housekeeping gene
human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were as follows:
5¶-CGAGCCACATCGCTCAGACA-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TGAGGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTC-3¶ (antisense), resulting in a 455-bp fragment. The RT-PCR
exponential phase was determined to allow semiquantitative comparisons.
Each PCR regime involved 5 min of initial denaturation step at 95jC
followed by 33 cycles at 94jC for 60 s, 60jC (galectin-7) or 65jC (GAPDH)
for 60 s, and 72jC for 1 min and 30 s. PCR products were separated by
electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gels.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The synthesized cDNA was diluted 1:2,
and 2 AL of the dilution were used for RT-PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR
with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was done using the
GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with the
relative standard curve method (25). Primers were the same as mentioned
above. The thermal cycling program consisted of an initial denaturation
step at 95jC for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 64jC, 30 s at 72jC,
and 10 s at 78jC. The expression level of each target gene was quantified
relative to GAPDH and transformed into log 2 values. All measurements
were done in triplicate.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, 1  104 cancer
cells with 100 AL suspension were grown in each well of 96-well plates.
After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with or without different
concentrations of drugs for another 24 or 48 h. Then, 20 AL MTT working
solution (5 mg/mL; Sigma) was added to each culture well and incubated
for 4 h. The absorbance (A) of each well was measured by a microculture
plate reader (Immunoreader, Japan Intermed Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at
540 nm. The percentage cell viability = (A of experimental wells / A of
control wells)  100.
Detection of apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. To detect
apoptosis, nuclear staining and flow cytometric analysis were done. For
nuclear staining, cells were stained with 1 mmol/L Hoechst 33342 solution
(Wako) and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic cells were
identified by morphologic changes (condensation and fragmentation of
their nuclei). For flow cytometric analysis, cells were harvested 24 h after
treatment with CDDP in the presence or absence of NAC or S600125 and
stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD; BD Biosciences). Flow
cytometry was done on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For
staining, harvested cells (1  106) were washed with ice-cold PBS and then
fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were treated with DNase-free RNase for
30 min at 37jC, washed with PBS, centrifuged, and incubated in PBS
containing 7-ADD (5 Amol/L). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
Flow cytometric estimation of intracellular redox state. The
intracellular redox state was estimated by the levels of intracellular
peroxides, which were monitored by flow cytometric analysis with 2¶,7¶dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) diacetate (DCFH-DA) as described previously

(26). Briefly, 1  106 cells were treated with or without CDDP for the
indicated times, and then the culture medium was replaced with freshly
prepared medium containing 5 Amol/L DCFH-DA. After 30 min of
incubation at 37jC, fluorescence intensity was measured by FACScan using
CellQuest software.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. After drug treatment, cells
were washed with PBS and lysed in an appropriate volume of ice-cold
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, containing
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Complete Mini, Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)]. Cellular lysates were clarified by
centrifugation at 13,000  g for 15 min and the protein concentrations of
the lysates were determined by a detergent-compatible protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Thirty to fifty micrograms of the lysates were boiled
for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% to 15%
Tris-HCl mini gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
following standard methods. Membranes were probed with appropriate
dilutions of primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. After extensive washes,

proteins were visualized by a chemiluminescent detection system (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).
For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in an
appropriate volume of ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP40, containing 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L NaF,
1 mmol/L PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets]. The lysates were
incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h after preclearance with
protein G-Sepharose beads for 30 min. Subsequently, they were incubated
with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The bead-bound proteins were
eluted by boiling for 5 min and subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Statistical analysis. All 2  2 tables were analyzed by the m2 test.
Differences between group means were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney
U test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Induction of galectin-7 by CDDP treatment in bladder
cancer cell lines. The expression of galectin-7 mRNA was analyzed
in a panel of bladder cancer cell lines, including RT112, TCCsup, EJ,

Figure 1. CDDP induces galectin-7 in bladder cancer cell lines. A, quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR showed the induction of galectin-7 mRNA with
(black columns ) or without (white columns ) CDDP treatment at the concentrations indicated in the figure among five urothelial cancer cell lines. The p53 status of these
cell lines was assessed by sequencing analysis. Values of quantitative RT-PCR. Columns, average values of relative expression ratios of galectin-7 (galectin-7/GAPDH
 1,000) from three independent experiments; bars, SD. CDDP concentration was an approximate value of the concentration of IC50 for each cell line. IC50
concentration was the concentration at which cell growth was inhibited by 50%, calculated from the regression line based on 24-h MTT assay. B, immunoblot analysis
showed that CDDP treatment (30 Amol/L) caused the induction of galectin-7 in RT112 in a time-dependent manner. The change of other p53 downstream molecules and
the cleavage of caspase-3 were also assessed simultaneously. Arrowhead, procaspase; black arrow, cleaved caspase. C, immunoblot analysis showed that the
induction of galectin-7 by CDDP was suppressed in RT112 p53DN-2 compared with RT112 neo. RT112 neo and RT112 p53DN-2 were treated with 30 Amol/L CDDP.
Twenty-four hours later, whole-cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting.

Galectin-7 in Chemosensitivity against CDDP

Figure 2. The effect of overexpression of galectin-7 in urothelial cancer cells on CDDP-induced cytotoxicity. A, immunoblot analysis confirmed galectin-7 expression in
stable transfectants of pEF1-galectin-7 into TCCsup and EJ bladder cancer cell lines. As controls, vector alone (pEF1-neo)–transfected TCCsup and vector alone
(pEF1-neo)–transfected EJ did not express galectin-7. neo, vector (pEF1-neo)–transfected cell; Gal7, galectin-7–transfected cell. B, there was no significant difference
in growth rates between galectin transfectants and control transfectants. Each of 4  103 cells was plated on 96-well plates, and cell proliferation was measured by MTT
assay every 24 h. C, Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining showed the acceleration of apoptosis in galectin-7–transfected TCCsup treated with 60 Amol/L CDDP for
36 h compared with TCCsup neo. White arrowheads, apoptotic cells. D, galectin-7 transfection to p53-mutant cells (TCCsup and EJ) enhanced the susceptibility
to CDDP but not in p53 WT cells (RT112). Cell viability was evaluated 24 or 48 h after CDDP treatment at the indicated concentrations using MTT assay in
galectin-7–transfected EJ, TCCsup, and RT112 cells compared with vector-only transfectants (EJ neo, TCCsup neo, and RT112 neo). Cell viability. Points, mean
percentage of three independent experiments; bars, SD.

J82, and RT4. Sequencing analysis confirmed the p53 status in these
cell lines; RT4 and RT112 had WT p53, whereas J82 and EJ had
missense mutation. TCCsup harbored nonsense mutation. Quantitative RT-PCR showed quite low levels of the expression of
galectin-7 mRNA in all five cell lines (Fig. 1A). When each cell line
was treated with CDDP at its corresponding concentration of IC50,
galectin-7 mRNA was induced in RT4 and RT112 18 h after CDDP
exposure, whereas it was not induced in other three cell lines. To
confirm the induction of galectin-7 at the protein level, RT112 cells
were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Treatment with CDDP
induced a gradual increase in p53 expression and, subsequently,
changes in the expression of p53-related genes, such as p21,
Bax, and Bcl-2 occurred. The expression of galectin-7 was induced
significantly 24 h after CDDP treatment, when apoptosis was
recognized as an increased cleavage of caspase-3. To confirm the
necessity of functional p53 to induce galectin-7 expression, the p53
dominant-negative mutant (p53DN) was transfected into RT112
cells, and two stable clones (RT112 p53DN-2 and RT112 p53DN-11)
were established. Western blot analysis showed that the induction

www.aacrjournals.org

of galectin-7 by CDDP was suppressed in RT112 p53DN-2
compared with RT112 neo (control). RT112 p53DN-11 also showed
similar results (data not shown). These results indicated that
galectin-7 expression was under the control of functional p53.
Enhancement of CDDP-induced cytotoxicity in p53-mutant
cells by galectin-7 transfection. To examine the roles of galectin7 in CDDP-induced cytotoxicity, we generated stable transfectants
expressing galectin-7 in TCCsup and EJ, both of which had mutated
p53 and did not express detectable levels of endogenous galectin-7
when exposed to CDDP. As a reference, we transfected the galectin7 gene into RT112, which had WT p53 and induced galectin-7 by
CDDP. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of galectin-7
in TCCsup Gal7 and EJ Gal7 (Fig. 2A). Under normal culture
conditions (10% FCS), the growth rate of these cells was similar to
that of control transfectants (TCCsup neo; Fig. 2B), and no
apoptosis was observed in these cells. However, when these
transfectants were treated with CDDP at concentrations of IC50 for
parent cells, more cells floated in TCCsup Gal7 than TCCsup neo.
Indeed, Hoechst 33342 staining showed that CDDP treatment

induced apoptosis as evidenced by nuclear fragmentation in
galectin-7 transfectants but not in control transfectants (Fig. 2B).
In addition, a decrease in cell survival rates after CDDP exposure
was observed in galectin-7 transfectants of p53-mutant cells
(TCCsup Gal7 and EJ Gal7) but not in control transfectants
(TCCsup neo and EJ neo). No significant difference was seen
between galectin-7 and control transfectants of RT112 after CDDP
exposure (Fig. 2D). In this case, we consider that it is because there
is no significant difference in the levels of galectin-7 expression
after CDDP exposure between galectin-7 and control transfectants
of RT112 (data not shown). These results clearly indicated that the
forced expression of galectin-7 in p53-mutant cell lines rendered
these cells more sensitive to CDDP-induced cytotoxicity.
Modification of cisplatin-induced apoptosis by galectin-7
via reactive oxygen species-JNK-Bax pathway. To investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of galectin-7 in
CDDP-induced cytotoxicity, the activation of JNK, Bax, and

caspases was examined after CDDP treatment in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis showed that transfection of
galectin-7 did not change the expression level of JNK nor Bax, but it
sustained highly accelerated JNK phosphorylation from 8 h after
CDDP exposure. JNK phosphorylation was also seen in control
transfectants after CDDP exposure; however, their levels are much
lower than galectin-7 transfectants. The activation of caspase-8/
caspase-9/caspase-3, as shown by an increase in their cleaved
products, occurred from 16 h after CDDP exposure. Concomitant
cleavage of PARP as a result of caspase activation was also
observed in galectin-7 transfectants. This concentration of CDDP,
on the other hand, did not activate caspases nor increase PARP
cleavage in control transfectants. Interestingly, compared with
control transfectants, in which there was no change in Bax
expression throughout CDDP exposure, a significant increase in its
expression 36 h after CDDP exposure was observed in galectin-7
transfectants. This observation suggested that up-regulation of

Figure 3. Enhancement of CDDP-induced cytotoxicity in p53-mutant cells by galectin-7 transfection was dependent on the JNK-Bax pathway. A, galectin-7–transfected
(TCCsup Gal7) or control-transfected TCCsup (TCCsup neo) was treated with 60 Amol/L CDDP. After the indicated periods, whole-cell lysates were prepared and
analyzed by immunoblotting as described in Materials and Methods, using the indicated antibodies. B, cotreatment with specific JNK inhibitor (SP600125) suppressed
galectin-7–mediated enhancement of CDDP cytotoxicity. Left, TCCsup cells were treated with either CDDP alone (5, TCCsup Gal7; n, TCCsup neo) or CDDP plus
40 Amol/L SP600125 (o, TCCsup Gal7; ., TCCsup neo) for 48 h; right, EJ neo or EJ Gal7 was treated by 200 Amol/L CDDP with or without 40 Amol/L SP600125 for
48 h. Cell viability is shown as the percentage of viable cells to each control, based on the results of MTT assays. Points and columns, average of at least three
independent experiments; bars, SD. C, the status of molecules associated with apoptosis was analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were harvested after treatment with
75 Amol/L CDDP in the presence or absence of 40 Amol/L SP600125 or no treatment for 24 h. Activated Bax and caspases as well as cleavage of PARP were seen
only in TCCsup Gal7. SP600125 inhibited activation of Bax and caspases resulting in the prevention of apoptosis in TCCsup Gal7. For assessing active Bax,
conformationally changed Bax protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-Bax 6A7 antibody and subjected to immunoblot analysis using polyclonal Bax antibody.

Galectin-7 in Chemosensitivity against CDDP

Figure 4. Accumulation of intracellular ROS was promoted by galectin-7 transfection, leading to apoptosis. A, the effect of CDDP treatment was measured on
the fluorescence distribution of DCFH oxidation in galectin-7–transfected (dashed line ) or control vector-transfected TCCsup (continuous line ). Cells (3  105) from
each cell line were cultured for 6 h in the absence or presence of CDDP (50 Amol/L), and then the culture medium was replaced with freshly prepared medium containing
10 Amol/L DCFH-DA. After 30 min of incubation at 37jC, fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry (continuous line , TCCsup neo; dashed line ,
TCCsup Gal7). Only part of TCCsup Gal7 (black arrows ) showed accelerated accumulation of intracellular ROS. B, concurrent treatment of antioxidant NAC inhibited
galectin-7–mediated enhancement of CDDP cytotoxicity. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting histogram of 7-AAD staining 24 h after continuous drug exposure
showed that 10 mmol/L NAC relieved the susceptibility to 75 Amol/L CDDP in TCCsup Gal7 to a similar level to TCCsup neo. C, immunoblot analysis showed that
concomitant use of NAC with CDDP suppressed JNK activation and apoptosis in TCCsup Gal7. Cells were harvested after treatment with 75 Amol/L CDDP in the
presence or absence of 10 mmol/L NAC or no treatment for 24 h. D, concurrent treatment of NAC relieved the oxidative status generated by CDDP treatment in part of
TCCsup Gal7, but SP600125 inversely promoted ROS generation (white arrowheads ). Intracellular ROS was measured on the fluorescence distribution of DCFH
oxidation 6 h after 50 Amol/L CDDP exposure in the presence or absence of 10 mmol/L NAC or 40 Amol/L SP600125.

Bax gene was induced at this time point in CDDP-exposed
galectin-7 transfectants.
To identify the significance of JNK activation in TCCsup Gal7,
cell viability was measured in the presence or absence of SP600125,
a specific inhibitor of JNK1/2. As shown in Fig. 3B, the inhibition of
JNK activation attenuated CDDP susceptibility of TCCsup Gal7 to
the same level as TCCsup neo. A similar result was obtained in EJ
galectin-7 (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis also showed that
SP600125 suppressed the activation of caspases and cleavage of
PARP in TCCsup Gal7 (Fig. 3C).
Bax has been reported to act downstream of JNK and to control
its proapoptotic function by conformational change (27, 28) and
translocation between cytosol and mitochondria even when the
total Bax protein level remains constant (29, 30). The status of Bax

was analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-Bax monoclonal
antibody 6A7, which recognizes the activated form of Bax. At
24 h after CDDP exposure, monomer and dimer forms of active Bax
were observed only in galectin-7 transfectants but not in control
transfectants (Fig. 3C). A moderate increase in total Bax is shown
in Fig. 3A. Furthermore, active Bax in galectin-7 transfectants was
partially suppressed when cells were treated with the JNK inhibitor
SP600125. These findings suggested that activation of a JNK-Baxmitochondria pathway played an important role in the enhancement of CDDP-induced cytotoxicity by galectin-7 transfection.
As the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been
reported to play an important role in CDDP-induced cytotoxicity
(31) and also to activate JNK (32), the effects of galectin-7 transfection were assessed on the intracellular redox status. As shown in

Figure 5. Relationship between the expression of galectin-7 mRNA and chemosensitivity. A, the expression of galectin-7 mRNA was assessed by quantitative
RT-PCR in 4 normal control samples and 17 invasive bladder cancer samples collected before preoperative MEC chemotherapy. The bladder cancer samples were
classified by the reduction ratio of the tumor volume after chemotherapy. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all known disease. A PR was defined as at
least a 50% decrease in measurable disease and no evidence of any new lesions or progression of any existing lesions. An inability to show a 50% decrease or a
25% increase in the tumor size, as well as no new lesions, defined no change (NC ). A 25% increase in the tumor size or the appearance of any new lesions defined PD.
Human skin was used as a positive control of galectin-7 expression. Box plot, the expression values of each category expressed as relative expression ratios of
galectin-7 [log 2 (galectin-7 mRNA/GAPDH mRNA)  1,000]. Points, maximum and minimum values for the group. Box, 75% of each group; line within the
box plot, median value. The bladder cancer samples were classified by the reduction ratio of the primary tumor volume after chemotherapy. B, the 2  2 analysis
comparing the high-expression group of galectin-7 with the low-expression group in relation to the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventeen bladder
cancer samples were divided into two groups by galectin-7 expression level. The median value of all samples was used as the cutoff point. P value was calculated by
the m2 test.

Fig. 4A, flow cytometric analysis with DCFH-DA showed that
galectin-7 transfection alone had no effects on the intracellular
redox status. However, exposure to a relatively low concentration of
CDDP (50 Amol/L) caused a significant increase in the accumulation of intracellular peroxides in TCCsup Gal7, whereas the same
concentration of CDDP did not change in intracellular ROS in
TCCsup neo. To determine the influence of the accumulation of
intracellular ROS on the susceptibility to CDDP-induced cytotoxicity, TCCsup Gal7 was treated with an antioxidant NAC. The
concomitant use of NAC with CDDP suppressed both JNK
activation and apoptosis in galectin-7 transfectants (Fig. 4B and
C). As expected, NAC reduced the accumulation of intracellular
ROS by CDDP. Interestingly, the concomitant use of JNK inhibitor
did not inhibit, but inversely accelerated, the accumulation of
intracellular ROS despite its antiapoptotic effect on CDDP-treated
TCCsup Gal7. This clearly indicated that ROS generation is
upstream of JNK activation in the context of CDDP-induced
apoptotic events. Taken together, these results indicated that
galectin-7 accelerated CDDP susceptibility through JNK activation
by increased generation of ROS.
The relationship of galectin-7 with chemosensitivity of
urothelial cancer. To elucidate whether galectin-7 expression is
associated with the chemosensitivity of urothelial cancers, its
expression levels were analyzed with quantitative RT-PCR in
4 normal controls and 17 invasive urothelial cancers, which were
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Fig. 5A). Among 17 bladder
cancer patients, 9 patients had favorable responses (CR or PR) to
chemotherapy. The relative expression ratios of galectin-7 calculated
as log 2 (galectin-7/GAPDH) were significantly lower in urothelial
cancers than normal urothelia (2.26 F 4.31 and 0.92 F 0.99,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

respectively; P = 0.025). Furthermore, its expression tended to be
higher in responders than nonresponders, although its difference
was marginal (3.46 F 4.62 and 1.06 F 3.86, respectively;
P = 0.054). When urothelial cancers were divided into two groups
with the median value (3.50) of the relative expression ratios of
galectin-7 as a cutoff point, nine patients were classified into a ‘‘highexpression group’’ and eight patients into a ‘‘low-expression group’’
(Fig. 5B). Seven of nine (78%) patients with high expression of
galectin-7 were responders, whereas only two of eight (25%) patients
with low expression were classified into the same group (P = 0.026).
These results indicated that galectin-7 might be a good candidate
gene of prediction for chemosensitivity in urothelial cancers.

Discussion
Galectin-7 was identified as PIG1, one of the genes highly
induced by p53 transfection into the colon cancer cell line DLD-1
(13). Galectin-7 was also reported to be expressed mainly in normal
stratified epithelial cells represented by the skin (19), although
there has been no report about its expression in urothelial cancer.
In the present study, we showed that CDDP exposure induced p53
and subsequently galectin-7 in bladder cancer cell lines with WT
p53 but not in lines with mutant p53. Furthermore, transfection of
galectin-7 sensitized these cancer cells with mutant p53 to CDDP
via the promotion of intracellular ROS generation. Moreover, we
showed that lower expression of galectin-7 was related to
unfavorable sensitivity to CDDP. These results indicated that
galectin-7 played an important role acting downstream of p53 in
urothelial cancer cells and is a novel candidate to influence
chemosensitivity to CDDP.

Galectin-7 in Chemosensitivity against CDDP

Galectin-7 has been reported to have various functions. As a
lectin existing on the cell surface, it reduces neuroblastoma cell
proliferation or, in contrast, acts as a factor promoting tumorigenesis via matrix metalloproteinase-9 up-regulation in lymphoma
(33, 34). Besides its lectin function, however, galectin-7 has been
recognized as a molecule that can promote the apoptotic process
intracellularly. In human epidermal keratinocytes, UVB irradiation
induced high levels of galectin-7 expression, resulting in apoptosis
(35). Moreover, galectin-7 overexpression made HeLa cells more
sensitive to various cytotoxic agents (20). In the present study,
galectin-7 transfection into bladder cancer cells (TCCsup and EJ),
which harbored mutated p53, did not seem to cause apoptosis nor
change cellular proliferation but promoted their susceptibility to
genotoxic stress by CDDP exposure. This result is compatible to
previous reports that galectin-7 itself did not cause apoptosis but it
enhanced sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli in vitro (20, 21).
With regard to proapoptotic functions of galectin-7, we have
suggested previously that galectin-7 acts upstream of JNK
activation (20). In this study, galectin-7–transfected TCCsup
showed highly accelerated JNK phosphorylation compared with
control transfectants. The activation of JNK as well as p38 MAPK is
necessary for apoptosis induced by several stresses, such as
cytokine, chemotherapy, and serum deprivation (36–39). Overactivation of the JNK pathway has also been reported to augment
CDDP-mediated cell death. Therefore, JNK activation is suspected
to have a central mechanism to promote CDDP susceptibility by
galectin-7. It is known that stress-induced activation of JNK has
dual functions and can contribute variously to cell survival as well
as apoptosis (40). We confirmed the contribution of JNK activation
to apoptosis using SP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK1/2, by
showing the attenuation of CDDP-induced apoptosis in galectin-7
transfectants by this reagent. Conformational change of Bax by JNK
has been reported to cause translocation of Bax from cytosol to
mitochondria and to form Bax active homodimers (27, 28, 41). By
using the JNK inhibitor, we also showed that conformational
change of Bax protein mediates apoptosis through JNK activation.
As for the mechanism underlying the activation of JNK,
intracellular ROS generation by CDDP has been considered a
possible upstream activator of JNK (30, 31). Our result of the
measurement of intracellular ROS showed the elevation of
intracellular ROS in galectin-7–transfected cells exposed to a
relatively low concentration of CDDP that had no effect on control
transfectants. Thus, we considered that, in galectin-7 transfectants,
the acceleration of ROS generation by CDDP caused activation of
the JNK-Bax pathway resulting in apoptosis via an intrinsic
pathway. In this regard, it is of note that we have shown by DNA
microarray analysis that galectin-7 affected the expression of

redox-related genes (20). Therefore, as future work, it may be
interesting to elucidate whether galectin-7 functions through
redox-related molecules.
Recently, the modulation of several genes, such as Bcl-2, NF-jB,
or PTEN, has been reported as a candidate to enhance chemosensitivity in urothelial cancer by increasing ROS produced by
conventional chemotherapeutic agents (42–44). In addition, the
pharmacologic or genetic modulation of thioredoxin or glutathione
S-transferase-k has been reported to effectively increase the
intracellular ROS level (26, 45, 46). Previously, we also reported
that the combinational use of CDDP and dicoumarol, an enzymatic
inhibitor of antioxidant enzyme NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1,
accelerated CDDP-induced apoptosis via the activation of JNK
(12), but it was effective only in bladder cancer cells with WT p53.
Now, we consider that galectin-7 may be a key molecule to
transmit the apoptotic signal via JNK activation and its manipulation become a new tool of therapeutic value to potentiate CDDP
cytotoxicity in bladder cancer cells with mutant p53.
As well as searching for new therapeutic molecular targets, it has
become very important to detect new markers that predict the
response to chemotherapy. The significance of p53 tumor
suppressor gene, in this context, has been controversial as to
whether it is responsible for the effects of CDDP-based systemic
chemotherapy. Moreover, recent reports using high-throughput
microarray analysis showed that RASL11B (RAS like, family 11,
member B) or PHKA2 (phosphorylase kinase 2) can be a new
candidate for a predictive marker (47), but there has been no report
referring to the relationship between galectin-7 expression and
sensitivity to CDDP. As our in vitro data showed a relationship
between galectin-7 expression and CDDP cytotoxicity, we examined
whether galectin-7 expression levels in clinical samples of bladder
cancer would correlate with CDDP-based chemotherapy. Our data
showed that bladder cancers expressing higher galectin-7 mRNA
tended to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy better than those
with lower expression.
In conclusion, galectin-7 expression may be related to the
chemosensitivity of urothelial cancer and our results will provide
potential for its targeted expression as a useful therapeutic
modality in the treatment of urothelial cancer.
