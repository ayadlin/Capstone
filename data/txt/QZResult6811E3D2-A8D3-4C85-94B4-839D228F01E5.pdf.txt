BACKGROUND: A large amount of interindividual variability exists in the occurrence of symptoms in patients receiving chemotherapy
(CTX). The purposes of the current study, which was performed in a sample of 582 oncology outpatients who were receiving CTX,
were to identify subgroups of patients based on their distinct experiences with 25 commonly occurring symptoms and to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with subgroup membership. In addition, differences in quality of life outcomes were
evaluated. METHODS: Oncology outpatients with breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, or lung cancer completed the Memorial
Symptom Assessment Scale before their next cycle of CTX. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct symptom experiences. RESULTS: Three distinct subgroups of patients were identified (ie, 36.1% in Low class; 50.0% in Moderate
class, and 13.9% in All High class). Patients in the All High class were significantly younger and more likely to be female and nonwhite,
and had lower levels of social support, lower socioeconomic status, poorer functional status, and a higher level of comorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the current study support the clinical observation that some oncology patients experience a differentially higher symptom burden during CTX. These high-risk patients experience significant decrements in quality of life. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Patients receiving chemotherapy (CTX) experience multiple cooccurring symptoms. On average, these patients report 10
unrelieved symptoms that have a negative impact on their functional status and quality of life (QOL).1 However, a significant amount of interindividual variability exists, with some patients experiencing a few symptoms whereas others experience every symptom associated with a given CTX regimen. The demographic and clinical characteristics that contribute
to this interindividual variability in patients’ symptom experiences warrant investigation so that high-risk patients can be
identified and preemptive symptom management interventions can be initiated.
Previous work from our research team focused on the identification of these high-risk patients based on an evaluation
of their experiences with the 4 most common symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment (ie, pain, fatigue, sleep
disturbance, and depression).2-6 Across 5 separate studies, using either cluster analysis or latent class analysis (LCA), 3 to 5
distinct subgroups of patients were identified. It is interesting to note that across all 5 studies, 1 subgroup of patients was
characterized as having low levels of all 4 symptoms and another subgroup was characterized as having high levels of all 4
symptoms. In these studies, compared with patients with low levels of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression,
patients in the “All High” subgroup were significantly younger and reported lower functional status and decreased
QOL.2-6 In the 2 studies that evaluated for differences in clinical characteristics among the patient subgroups,2,6 no differences were identified.

Original Article

In another group of studies7,8 that used symptom
occurrence ratings from the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS)9 to identify high-risk patients, only 2
distinct subgroups were identified, namely patients with
low and high symptom occurrence rates. Again, in both of
these studies, although clinical characteristics were not
associated with subgroup membership, patients in the
high symptom subgroup reported decrements in functional status and QOL. The reason for the inconsistent
number of subgroups identified across these 7 studies2-8
may relate to the number of symptoms evaluated, whether
symptom occurrence or severity ratings were used to create the patient subgroups, and the statistical procedures
used to identify the subgroups, as well as the relatively
small sample sizes.
In the era of precision medicine,10 the specialty of
oncology has led efforts to identify distinct tumor subtypes for several cancers (eg, breast cancer11,12 and lung
cancer13) based on tumor-specific characteristics and molecular profiles. The goal of these efforts is to develop
mechanistically based cancer treatments.14 Despite some
limitations, the emerging evidence cited above suggests
that similar studies need to be performed to identify distinct subgroups of patients who will require more targeted
symptom management interventions while undergoing
cancer treatment.2-8 The purposes of the current study,
performed in a sample of 582 oncology outpatients who
were receiving CTX were to identify subgroups of patients
based on their distinct experiences with 25 commonly
occurring symptoms and to identify demographic and
clinical characteristics associated with subgroup membership. In addition, differences in QOL outcomes were
evaluated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Settings

The current study is part of an ongoing longitudinal study
of the symptom experience of oncology outpatients
receiving CTX. Eligible patients were aged  18 years;
had a diagnosis of breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological,
or lung cancer; had received CTX within the preceding 4
weeks; were scheduled to receive at least 2 additional
cycles of CTX; were able to read, write, and understand
English; and provided written informed consent. Patients
were recruited from 2 comprehensive cancer centers, 1
Veterans Affairs hospital, and 4 community-based oncology programs. A total of 969 patients were approached
and 582 consented to participate (60.1% response rate).
The major reason for refusal was being overwhelmed with
their cancer treatment.
2372

Instruments

A demographic questionnaire obtained information
regarding age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, living arrangements, education, employment status, and income. The
Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scale15 was used to
evaluate patients’ functional status. The Self-administered
Comorbidity Questionnaire16 evaluated the occurrence,
treatment, and functional impact of comorbid conditions
(eg, diabetes, arthritis).
The MSAS was used to evaluate the occurrence, severity, frequency, and distress of 32 symptoms commonly
associated with cancer and its treatment. The MSAS is a
self-report questionnaire designed to measure the multidimensional experience of symptoms. Patients were asked
to indicate whether they had experienced each symptom
within the past week (ie, symptom occurrence). If they
had experienced the symptom, they were asked to rate its
frequency of occurrence, severity, and distress. The reliability and validity of the MSAS is well established in
studies of oncology inpatients and outpatients.9,17
Quality of life (QOL) was evaluated using generic
(ie, Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form-12 [SF-12])18
and disease-specific (ie, Quality of Life Scale-Patient Version [QOL-PV]) measures.19-21 Both measures have wellestablished validity and reliability. Higher scores on both
measures indicate a better QOL.
Study Procedures

The study was approved by the Committee on Human
Research at the University of California at San Francisco
and by the Institutional Review Board at each of the study
sites. Eligible patients were approached by a research staff
member in the infusion unit to discuss participation in the
study. Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients. Depending on the length of their CTX cycles,
patients completed questionnaires in their homes, a total of
6 times over 2 cycles of CTX (ie, before CTX administration [ie, recovery from previous CTX cycle], approximately
1 week after CTX administration [ie, acute symptoms],
and approximately 2 weeks after CTX administration [ie,
potential nadir]). For this analysis, symptom occurrence
data from the enrollment assessment that asked patients to
report on their symptom experience for the week before the
administration of the next cycle of CTX were analyzed (ie,
recovery from previous CTX cycle). Medical records were
reviewed for disease and treatment information.
Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (version 20; IBM, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics and

chi-square analyses. A P value of < .05 was considered to
be statistically significant. As was done in our previous
studies,5,30-32 based on the recommendations of Rothman33 and the large sample size, adjustments were not
made for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS

frequency distributions were calculated for demographic
and clinical characteristics.
LCA was used to identify subgroups of patients (ie,
latent classes) with similar symptom experiences.22,23
Although the MSAS evaluates the occurrence, severity,
and distress associated with 32 symptoms, for this analysis
and consistent with previous studies,7,8 the LCA was performed based on patients’ ratings of symptom occurrence.
Because this analysis was somewhat exploratory, only data
from the enrollment assessment were used in the LCA.
LCA identifies latent classes based on an observed
response pattern.24,25 To have a sufficient number of
patients with each symptom to perform the LCA, the
MSAS symptoms that occurred in  40% of the patients
were used to identify the distinct latent classes. A total of
25 of 32 symptoms from the MSAS occurred in  40% of
the patients.
The final number of latent classes was identified by
evaluating the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and
entropy. The model that fits the data best had the lowest
BIC.26 In addition, well-fitting models produce entropy
values of  .80.27 Finally, well-fitting models “make
sense” conceptually and the estimated classes differ as
might be expected on variables not used in the generation
of the model.26

Latent Class Analysis

A total of 25 symptoms from the MSAS occurred in
 40% of the patients (Fig. 1) Using LCA, 3 distinct
latent classes of patients were identified based on their ratings of the occurrence of these 25 MSAS symptoms. Fit
indices for the candidate models are shown in Table 1.
The 3-class solution was selected because its BIC was
lower than the BIC for both the 2-class and 4-class solutions. As summarized in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure
1, the largest percentage of patients (291 patients; 50.0%)
was classified in the “Moderate” class. The probability of
occurrence for the majority of the MSAS symptoms for
this class was between 0.4 and 0.6. A second group, which
comprised 13.9% of patients (81 patients) was classified
as the “All High” class. The probability of occurrence for
the majority of the MSAS symptoms for this class was
between 0.7 and 1.0. The third class, comprised of 36.1%
of the sample (210 patients), was classified as the “Low”
class. The probability of occurrence for the majority of the
MSAS symptoms for this class was between 0.1 and 0.4.
Differences in Patient Characteristics Among
the Latent Classes

Table 2 summarizes the differences in demographic and clinical characteristics among the latent classes. Compared with
the Low class, patients in the Moderate and All High classes
were more likely to be female and significantly younger,
reported a lower KPS score, and had a higher comorbidity
score. With the exception of the KPS and comorbidity scores,
none of the clinical characteristics (ie, time since diagnosis,
cancer diagnosis, types and number of prior treatments,

Differences in QOL Scores Among the Latent
Classes

As shown in Figure 2A, for all of the scales on the SF-12 as
well as the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and
Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, patients in
the All High class reported significantly lower scores compared with patients in the Moderate class. Except for the
General Health score on the SF-12, patients in the Moderate class reported significantly lower scores than patients
in the Low class.
As shown in Figure 2B, with the exception of the
Spiritual Well-Being subscale, patients in the All High
class reported significantly lower scores on the QOL-PV
subscale and total scores than patients in the Moderate
class. Patients in the Moderate class reported significantly
lower QOL-PV scores than patients in the Low class.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first to use
LCA to identify 3 distinct subgroups of patients based on
their reports of the occurrence of 25 common symptoms
before their next cycle of CTX. Consistent with our previous studies,2,5,6 approximately 14% of the patients
reported relatively high occurrence rates for all 25 symptoms. The mean number of symptoms reported by
patients in the All High class (ie, 20.3) is higher than the
mean of 10 symptoms reported in cross-sectional studies
that did not use specific analytic techniques to identify
interindividual variability in patients’ symptom experiences.1 Equally important, patients in the Low class reported
an average of 6 symptoms, which constitutes a fairly high
symptom burden. Findings from the current study suggest that rather than simply reporting the mean number
of symptoms, future studies should use the types of statistical approaches used in this and other studies2,5-8 to be
able to identify oncology patients at higher risk of
increased symptom burden. The reliance on mean values
for the total number of symptoms will overestimate and
underestimate symptom burden and not allow for the
identification of patients who require more intensive
symptom management interventions.
Although none of the clinical characteristics, except
KPS and comorbidity, was found to be associated with
class membership, several demographic characteristics differentiated among the 3 latent classes. Consistent with
previous reports,5,34,35 younger patients were more likely
to be in the All High class. Several potential explanations
may account for this finding: older patients may receive
lower doses of CTX36,37; age-related changes may occur
in the hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis that mediate
2375

Original Article

the occurrence of cancer-related symptoms38; or older
patients may experience a “response shift” in their perception of symptoms.39,40 Other characteristics that differentiated among the classes were sex and ethnicity, with a
higher percentage of women and nonwhite individuals
being in the All High class. Additional research is warranted because findings regarding sex41-45 and ethnic46,47
differences in the occurrence and severity of symptoms in
oncology patients are inconsistent.
Equally important, several socioeconomic characteristics were found to be associated with a higher symptom
burden. The finding that marital status distinguished
among the 3 latent classes may be related to perceived levels of social support. In several studies, oncology patients
who reported higher levels of social support reported
lower levels of depressive symptoms.48-50 Although social
support was not measured in the current study, this hypothesis is supported by the finding that patients in the
Moderate and All High classes reported significantly
lower social functioning scores on both the generic and
disease specific measures of QOL. Consistent with previous reports,51-53 patients in the All High class were more
likely to report a lower annual household income. The
reason for this disparity warrants investigation in future
studies.
It is interesting to note that for both the generic and
disease-specific measures of QOL, patients in the All
High class reported worse QOL outcomes than patients
in the Low and Moderate classes. Compared with the Low
class, decrements in functional status reported by the
Moderate (d 5 0.5) and All High (d 5 1.1) classes represent not only statistically significant but clinically meaningful differences in KPS scores.54,55 The effect size
indicator (ie, d) equals the difference between the 2 group
means in standard deviation units. Similar effect sizes
were found for the various subscales of both the generic
and disease-specific QOL measures. In terms of the SF-12
PCS scores, all 3 classes had scores below the US population mean score of 50. The effect size calculations for differences between the Low and Moderate classes, as well as
the Low and All High classes, in PCS scores were d 5 0.6
and d 5 1.0, respectively.
For the SF-12 MCS scores, the Moderate and All
High classes had scores below national norms. The effect
size calculations for the MCS scores indicated clinically
meaningful differences between the Low and Moderate
(d 5 0.5) as well as the Low and High (d 5 1.3) classes.
Finally, the effect size calculations for the total score on the
disease-specific measure of QOL (ie, QOL-PV19-21) identified clinically meaningful differences when the Low class
2376

was compared with the Moderate (d 5 0.9) and All High
(d 5 1.6) classes. Taken together and consistent with previous reports,2,5-8 these findings emphasize the significant
impact that the cooccurrence of multiple symptoms has on
patients’ ability to function and their QOL.
Although consistent with previous reports,2-4,6-8 a
surprising finding from the current study is that with the
exception of the decrements in functional status and severity of comorbidities, none of the disease and treatment
characteristics was found to be associated with class membership. The relatively small and heterogeneous samples
in terms of cancer treatment may explain the lack of associations between disease and treatment characteristics
observed in previous studies. However, in the current
study, the large sample size as well as the relatively even
distribution of cancer diagnoses, reasons for CTX, and
extent of metastatic disease across the 3 latent classes suggests that alternative explanations are plausible. One
potential explanation for the lack of disease and treatment
effects is that patients with a higher disease burden and
more severe symptoms declined study participation.
Another explanation for the lack of disease and treatment
effects is that interindividual variability in patients’ symptom experiences may be associated with genetic and epigenetic determinants. This hypothesis is supported by work
from our research team and others on the association
between several candidate genes and individual symptoms
(eg, pain,32,56,57 fatigue,58-63 depression,30,64,65 and sleep
disturbance31) in oncology patients. Studies currently are
underway in the study laboratory to identify specific biomarkers associated with membership in the All High class
identified herein.
Several study limitations need to be acknowledged.
Patients were recruited at various points in their CTX. In
addition, the types of CTX were not homogeneous.
Although we cannot rule out the potential contributions
of clinical characteristics to patients’ symptom experiences, the relatively similar percentages of cancer diagnoses,
reasons for current treatment, time since diagnosis, and
evidence of metastatic disease suggest that the classes were
relatively similar in terms of disease and treatment characteristics. Although it is possible that patients in the Low
class were receiving more aggressive symptom management interventions, the occurrence rates for the 5 most
common symptoms (ie, lack of energy, difficulty sleeping,
pain, feeling drowsy, and difficulty concentrating) were
relatively proportional across the 3 classes. The study used
symptom occurrence rates in the LCA and did not evaluate for changes over time in latent class membership. It is
possible that using ratings of severity or distress to create

the latent classes would provide additional information
on interindividual differences in the symptom experience
of these patients.
In conclusion, the findings from the current study
support the clinical observation that some oncology
patients experience a differentially higher symptom burden during CTX. Risk factors identified in this study
included younger age, being female, being nonwhite, having lower levels of social support, being of lower socioeconomic status, having poorer functional status, and having
a higher level of comorbidity. These high-risk patients experience significant decrements in QOL. Future studies
will focus on the identification of molecular mechanisms
that contribute to this high-risk phenotype, as well as the
identification of latent classes using patients’ ratings of
symptom severity and distress.
