Abstract
Tamoxifen has been the most important therapeutic agent for
the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer
for the past three decades. Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, and recent in vivo studies
have shown that women with genetically impaired cytochrome
P450 2D6 have reduced production of endoxifen and
a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence. Despite these
observations, the contribution of endoxifen to the overall
drug effectiveness of tamoxifen remains uncertain. Here, we
provide novel evidence that endoxifen is a potent antiestrogen
that functions in part by targeting ERA for degradation by the
proteasome in breast cancer cells. Additionally, we show that
endoxifen blocks ERA transcriptional activity and inhibits
estrogen-induced breast cancer cell proliferation even in the
presence of tamoxifen, N-desmethyl-tamoxifen, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. All of the effects of endoxifen are concentration
dependent and do not occur at concentrations observed in
human CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. These results support the
theory that endoxifen is the primary metabolite responsible
for the overall effectiveness of tamoxifen in the treatment of
ER-positive breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(5):1722–7]

Introduction
Women diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast
cancer are commonly treated with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is
extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system
into 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4HT), and N-desmethyl-tamoxifen (NDT;
refs. 1, 2), followed by secondary metabolism to 4-hydroxy-Ndesmethyl-tamoxifen (endoxifen; ref. 3). Although it has been
assumed that 4HT is the primary means by which tamoxifen exerts
its antibreast cancer effect, recent studies suggest that endoxifen is
significantly more potent than tamoxifen and equipotent to 4HT
in its ability to bind to ERa and ERh, and in suppression of
ER-dependent breast cancer proliferation (4, 5).
Endoxifen is formed in the liver by the CYP2D6-mediated
oxidation of NDT (1, 3, 6) and CYP2D6 polymorphisms and druginduced inhibition of CYP2D6 enzyme activity significantly reduce
endoxifen concentrations in humans (3, 7, 8). Retrospective
analyses of four separate cohorts of women receiving adjuvant
tamoxifen showed that women with impaired CYP2D6 metabolism
have a significantly higher risk of breast cancer recurrence (9–13),

and while taking tamoxifen, are less likely to report hot flashes (10).
Although the clinical observations suggest that endoxifen may be
an important tamoxifen metabolite, little is known about the
actions of endoxifen on the ER or the mechanism by which it
functions to suppress breast cancer progression. Furthermore,
some have speculated that the ER is fully saturated by tamoxifen
(14), which would diminish the importance of variability in
endoxifen concentrations. Therefore, we sought to further characterize the ability of endoxifen to block ER function and repress
breast cancer cell proliferation, and to determine whether the
effects of endoxifen on breast cancer cells are maintained in the
presence of tamoxifen and its primary metabolites.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and chemicals. MCF7, T47D, and parental Hs578T cells
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Ishikawa cells were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. These cell lines were grown in phenol red–
free DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Hs578T-ERa and U2OS-ERa cells were developed and cultured as previously
described (15, 16). All cell treatments were performed in DMEM/F12
medium containing 10% triple charcoal stripped FBS. (Z)-endoxifen was
synthesized by Dr. Abdul Fauq (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). All ER ligands
used in this study were resuspended in 100% ethanol.
Cell treatments. For analysis of ERa protein levels after ER ligand
treatments, cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates and treated as
indicated. Doxycycline was included in the cell culture medium at a final
concentration of 100 ng/mL throughout all experiments involving the
Hs578T-ERa or U2OS-ERa cells to induce ERa expression. For MG132
treatments, cells were plated as above and pretreated with either DMSO
vehicle or 25 Amol/L MG132 for 1 h. Cells were then treated for an
additional 8 h with indicated ER ligands in the presence of either DMSO
or MG132.
Protein isolation and Western blotting. Following ER ligand treatments, cells were washed twice with 1 PBS and cell extracts were prepared
using Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad). ERa protein levels were analyzed in the
MCF7, T47D, and Ishikawa cells using an anti-ERa antibody (HC-20). A flagspecific antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to detect ERa protein in the
Hs578T-ERa and U2OS-ERa cell lines. Tubulin protein levels were measured
using an anti–tubulin antibody (Sigma Aldrich). Protein levels were
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).
Transient transfection and luciferase assays. Parental Hs578T cells
were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates and transfected in triplicate with
250 ng per well of the ERE-TK-luciferase reporter construct and 250 ng per
well of an ERa expression construct (PCDNA4/TO Flag ERa) using Fugene 6
(Roche Applied Science). After transfection, cells were treated as indicated
for 24 h. Cells were lysed and equal amounts of extract were assayed for
luciferase activity.
Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. MCF7 cells were plated in
100-mm tissue-culture plates and treated as indicated for 24 h. Total RNA
was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Five hundred nanograms
of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit
(Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was performed as described previously (17).
Primers specific for amphiregulin and c-Myc were as follows: amphiregulin

then plated at a density of 2,000 cells per well in 96-well tissue culture plates
and treated as indicated every 48 h. Cell proliferation assays were
conducted 8 days after the first treatment using a CellTiter-Glo

Luminescent Cell Viability kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

Results and Discussion
We first sought to determine if endoxifen had actions similar to
that of 4HT or ICI at the level of ER stability/degradation.
Treatment of MCF7 cells, which endogenously express ERa, with
tamoxifen and 4HT results in stabilization of the ER (Fig. 1A).
However, treatment with endoxifen reduces ERa protein levels

similar to that of ICI (Fig. 1A). No significant changes were
observed in ERa protein levels after treatment with NDT (Fig. 1A).
Similar results were also observed in T47D cells (Fig. 1A). These
observations were further confirmed in Hs578T breast cancer cells
stably expressing ERa (Fig. 1A; ref. 15). The same patterns of ERa
protein levels were observed in U2OS-ERa osteosarcoma cells
(Fig. 1A). However, endoxifen treatment did not result in reduced
ERa protein levels in Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells
(Fig. 1A).
To determine the concentration of endoxifen that optimally
increases ERa protein turnover, dose response studies in MCF7
cells were performed. These studies revealed that endoxifen
concentrations between 10 and 1,000 nmol/L enhance ERa
protein degradation (Fig. 1B). Lower concentrations of endoxifen
(V1 nmol/L) do not affect ERa protein levels (Fig. 1B). We next
performed a time course study using 100 nmol/L endoxifen
concentrations to analyze the rate at which ER protein turnover
occurs. These studies revealed significant decreases in ERa protein
levels within 6 hours of endoxifen treatment (Fig. 1C). To show that
the decreased ERa protein levels were due to protein degradation,
the proteasome was inhibited with MG132. Inhibition of proteasome activity blocks ERa degradation in response to endoxifen
(Fig. 1D). These data show that endoxifen functions differently
from its parent compound, tamoxifen, and the other tamoxifen
metabolites, with regard to its effect on ERa protein stability.
The above studies describe the individual effects of tamoxifen,
4HT, NDT, and endoxifen on ERa stability. However, in a patient
receiving tamoxifen therapy, these metabolites are present together
at various concentrations. In women taking tamoxifen at a dose of
20 mg/day, the average steady-state concentrations of tamoxifen,
4HT, and NDT are 335, 7.4, and 695 nmol/L, respectively (7, 8).
Conversely, the plasma concentrations of endoxifen vary widely
and are dependent on the activity of CYP2D6 enzyme. The CYP2D6
phenotypes which result from common genetic polymorphisms
include poor (PM), intermediate (IM), extensive (EM), and
ultrarapid (UM) metabolizers. Extensive metabolizers typically
have plasma endoxifen concentrations of 90 nmol/L (F40 nmol/L),
intermediate metabolizers between 40 and 60 nmol/L, and poor
metabolizers <30 nmol/L (7).
Because endoxifen is the only tamoxifen metabolite that elicits
increased ERa protein degradation in breast cancer cells, we
hypothesized that high endoxifen concentrations corresponding to
the levels seen in CYP2D6 EM would result in increased ERa
protein turnover even in the presence of tamoxifen and the other
tamoxifen metabolites, whereas low concentrations of endoxifen
(corresponding to CYP2D6 PM) would not. To determine if
endoxifen could out-compete tamoxifen, 4HT, and NDT, we
pretreated MCF7 cells for 4 hours using the average concentration
of these metabolites that exist in patients receiving the standard
dose of tamoxifen therapy (20 mg/day). This was followed by
endoxifen treatments of 1,000, 100, 40, or 20 nmol/L for an
additional 20 hours to mimic the various CYP2D6 phenotypes. As
expected, treatment of MCF7 cells with a combination of
tamoxifen, 4HT, and NDT resulted in ERa protein stabilization
(Fig. 2). Treatment of cells with high concentrations of endoxifen
(100–1,000 nmol/L) resulted in significant decreases in ERa
protein levels, even in the presence of tamoxifen and the other
metabolites (Fig. 2). In contrast, low concentrations of endoxifen
(20–40 nmol/L) did not induce ERa protein degradation (Fig. 2).
These results were confirmed in Hs578T and U2OS cells stably
expressing ERa (Fig. 2). These data show that the concentrations of

Figure 2. High concentrations of endoxifen (100–1,000 nmol/L) compete with
tamoxifen (300 nmol/L), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (7 nmol/L), and NDT (700 nmol/L),
resulting in increased ERa protein degradation, whereas low concentrations of
endoxifen (20–40 nmol/L) do not. Western blot depicting ERa protein levels in

endoxifen typically seen in CYP2D6 EM are able to induce ERa
degradation, even in the presence of tamoxifen and the other
tamoxifen metabolites.
To determine whether or not endoxifen blocks ERa function, we
examined the transcriptional activation of an estrogen response
element (ERE). Parental Hs578T cells were transiently transfected
with an ERa expression construct and an ERE-luciferase reporter
construct and treated as indicated for 24 hours. The results of these
studies show that the ERE is activated in the presence of estrogen
and is repressed to varying degrees by all of the tamoxifen
metabolites as well as ICI (Fig. 3A). Next, we sought to determine if
a combination of tamoxifen, 4HT, and NDT could block estrogeninduced ERE activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, a combination of these
three selective estrogen receptor modulators slightly reduces ERE
activity in the presence of estrogen. However, the addition of high
concentrations of endoxifen (100–1,000 nmol/L) completely block
ERE activation, whereas low concentrations (20–40 nmol/L) are
less effective (Fig. 3B). The same patterns of ERE activation and
repression were observed when using 10 nmol/L concentrations of
estrogen (data not shown).
To confirm these results and to determine if endoxifen is able to
block the estrogen activation of endogenous genes, we analyzed the
expression levels of amphiregulin and c-Myc in MCF7 cells.
Amphiregulin and c-Myc were chosen based on the fact that they
are well known targets of ERa that play important roles in breast
cancer. As shown in Fig. 3C, amphiregulin and c-Myc expression
are induced by estrogen treatment. Concentrations of tamoxifen,

Endoxifen Is a Potent Antiestrogen that Degrades ERa

4HT, and NDT observed in patients receiving tamoxifen therapy
do not block estrogen activation of these genes; however, high
concentrations of endoxifen either completely block or significantly
reduce estrogen activation (Fig. 3C). Additionally, the combination
of tamoxifen, 4HT, and NDT are unable to block the estrogen
activation of amphiregulin and c-Myc (Fig. 3D). However, the
addition of high concentrations of endoxifen either completely
block or significantly reduce this activation, whereas low concentrations of endoxifen do not (Fig. 3D). The same patterns of
amphiregulin and c-Myc activation and repression were observed
when using 10 nmol/L concentrations of estrogen (data not
shown). These results are in agreement with the ERE studies
(Fig. 3A and B) and again show that endoxifen, at concentrations
observed in patients, is the most potent tamoxifen metabolite with
regard to its ability to suppress ERa-mediated transcription.

It is well-accepted that estrogen induces ER-positive breast
cancer cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro, and previous
studies have clearly shown that endoxifen is equipotent with 4HT
in inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation (4, 5). However, we
sought to confirm whether endoxifen could inhibit estrogeninduced proliferation even in the setting of tamoxifen, 4HT, and
NDT. As indicated in Fig. 4, treatment of MCF7 cells with estrogen
results in a significant increase in their proliferation rate. The
combination of tamoxifen, 4HT, and NDT modestly reduces the rate
of MCF7 cell proliferation in response to estrogen (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a dose response is observed with the addition of endoxifen.
Although low concentrations of endoxifen (20–40 nmol/L)
significantly repress the estrogen-induced growth of MCF7 cells,
high endoxifen concentrations (100–1,000 nmol/L) either completely block or drastically repress this response (Fig. 4). As with the

estrogen treatment of these cells did not result in a significant
increase in their proliferation, this is likely due to the fact that
1 nmol/L estrogen concentrations were used. Indeed, others have
reported increased proliferation rates of Ishikawa cells when much
higher concentrations of estrogen are used (18, 19). The addition of
1,000 nmol/L endoxifen resulted in a slight but significant decrease
in cell proliferation in the presence of 1 nmol/L estrogen and a
combination of tamoxifen, 4HT, and NDT. However, lower
concentrations of endoxifen (20–100 nmol/L) had no effect on
the proliferation rates of these cells relative to estrogen alone or to
the combination treatment of estrogen plus tamoxifen, 4HT, and
NDT. These data suggest that endoxifen is relatively ineffective at
either inducing or repressing Ishikawa cell growth under
conditions mimicking that of a patient receiving the standard
dose of tamoxifen therapy.
In this article, we show that endoxifen, a tamoxifen metabolite, is
a potent antiestrogen that mimics the actions of ICI with regard to
its ability to target ERa for degradation by the proteasome, to block
ERa-mediated transcriptional activation and to inhibit estrogeninduced breast cancer cell proliferation. It is important to note that
these effects of endoxifen are maintained even in the presence of
tamoxifen, 4HT, and NDT at concentrations observed in patients.
Of particular importance, concentrations of endoxifen mimicking
those found in the plasma of CYP2D6 EM are much more potent
than those of a CYP2D6 PM. These data correlate well with the
clinical observations demonstrating CYP2D6 genotype as a
predictive marker for the effectiveness of tamoxifen. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to show that the mechanism of
action of endoxifen is different than that of 4HT because it targets
the ER for degradation. Additionally, these data suggest that the
optimal drug effect of tamoxifen is directly related to endoxifen
concentrations and the ability of this metabolite to degrade rather
than stabilize the ER. Furthermore, these studies confirm and
provide a basis for CYP2D6 genotyping as a means of individualizing the optimal endocrine therapy for women with endocrineresponsive breast cancer. Finally, this study lays the ground work
for developing endoxifen, or related compounds, as an alternative
drug treatment for women with ER-positive breast tumors.

of estrogen (data not shown). These results are in agreement with
the transcriptional studies described in Fig. 3 and again show
that endoxifen is the most potent tamoxifen metabolite at
concentrations found in patients receiving tamoxifen therapy. To
determine if endoxifen behaves similarly in endometrial cancers,
Ishikawa cells were treated in the same manner as above. Although
