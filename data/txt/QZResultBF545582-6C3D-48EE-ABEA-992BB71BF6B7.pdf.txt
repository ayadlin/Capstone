Abstract
Ever accumulating evidence indicates that the long-term effects of radiotherapy
and chemotherapy largely depend on the induction (or restoration) of an anticancer
immune response. Here, we investigated this paradigm in the context of esophageal
carcinomas treated by neo-adjuvant radiochemotherapy, in a cohort encompassing
196 patients. We found that the density of the FOXP3+ regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltrate
present in the residual tumor (or its scar) correlated with the pathological response
(the less Tregs the more pronounced was the histological response) and predicted
cancer-specific survival. In contrast, there was no significant clinical impact of the
frequency of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. At difference with breast or colorectal cancer, a
loss-of-function allele of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) improved cancer-specific survival
of patients with esophageal cancer. While a loss-of-function allele of purinergic
receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel, 7 (P2RX7) failed to affect cancer-specific
survival, its presence did correlate with an increase in Treg infiltration. Altogether,
these results corroborate the notion that the immunosurveillance seals the fate of
patients with esophageal carcinomas treated with conventional radiochemotherapy.

Introduction

as toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and purinergic receptor P2X,
ligand-gated ion channel, 7 (P2RX7) [12, 13] and the local
expression of genes [such as myxovirus (influenza virus)
resistance 1 (MX1)]) that are tied to the type 1 interferon
response [14]. While loss-of-function mutations affecting
TLR4 or P2RX7 have a negative impact on the survival of
breast cancer patients [12, 13], local expression of MX1
constitutes a positive prognostic marker [14]. Nonetheless,
these biomarkers do not have a universal impact on cancer
patient survival. For example, we found that loss-offunction alleles of TLR4 and P2RX7 have no significant
impact on the survival of patients with non-small cell lung
cancer [15].
Driven by these considerations, we decided to
investigate the influence of immunological parameters
on the therapeutic response and survival of patients with
esophageal carcinoma. We demonstrate that the frequency
of Tregs determined in the surgical specimen after
radiochemotherapy has a major impact on the pathological
and clinical response.

There is growing awareness of the fact that cancer
is not just a cell-autonomous disease determined by
accumulating (epi)genetic aberrations in transforming
and neoplastic cells. Rather, cancer is also a systemic
disease in thus far that it only occurs upon failure of the
immunosurveillance system [1, 2]. Moreover, in spite
of the fact that cytotoxic or so-called targeted therapies
have been conceived as having purely cell-autonomous
effects, it has become increasingly clear that they only can
extend patient survival on the long-term if they succeed in
reinstating immunosurveillance [3-5].
The importance of immunosurveillance has been
particularly well documented for breast cancer, perhaps
driven by its high frequency, as well as the fact that neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapies do have long-term
effects and significantly extend overall survival of patients
with this pathology [6, 7]. The efficacy of neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy of mammary carcinomas is increased by
pre-existing anticancer immune response, as indicated
by the presence of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTL) in the tumor bed at diagnosis [6-9]. Moreover, an
amelioration of the ratio between CD8+ CTL and FOXP3+
regulatory T cells (Tregs) after one cycle of anthracyclinebased chemotherapy is able to predict the pathological
complete response after six cycles of chemotherapy [10,
11].
Additional immunological relevant factors that
affect the prognosis of breast cancer patients include lossof-function alleles of pattern recognition receptors (such

therapeutic response of breast cancer patients to adjuvant
chemotherapy [12, 13]. Moreover, the most common lossof-function allele of TLR4 (Asp299Gly) also is a poor
prognostic feature for colorectal cancer patients treated
with adjuvant chemotherapy [16]. Given these premises,
we determined the impact of such loss-of-function alleles
on the survival of 196 esophageal cancer patients that
were treated with neo-adjuvant radiochemotherapy (Table
1, Supplemental Figure 1). To our surprise, we found
that patients harboring one copy of the mutated allele of
TLR4 exhibited an improved cancer-specific survival as
compared to the majority of patients bearing two copies
of the most frequent, functional TLR4 allele (Figure 1A).
In contrast, loss-of-function alleles affecting P2RX7
(Glu496Ala, Figure 1B), the autophagy-relevant gene
autophagy related 16-like 1 (S. cerevisiae) (ATG16L1,
rs2241880, Thr300Ala) (Supplemental Figure 2A) and
the autoimmune disease-related gene protein tyrosine
phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (lymphoid) (PTPN22,
rs2476601, Arg620Trp) (Supplemental Figure 2B) had no
impact on patients survival. These findings are reminiscent
of those previously obtained on patients with non-small
cell lung cancer, in which loss-of-function mutation of
TLR4 had positive effects while that affecting P2RX7 had
no impact [15].

Thus, the presence of CD8+ T lymphocytes within
tumor nodules before treatment has been interpreted as
having a positive impact on overall survival [17-21]. In
contrast, according to one study, macrophage infiltration
was positively associated with CD8+ T lymphocyte
infiltration, yet negative associated with cancer-specific
survival in esophageal adenocarcinoma [22]. Here, we
investigated the rather heterogeneous density of the CD8+
T cell infiltrate within the residual tumor (or in the case
of its complete disappearance within the cicatricial tissue)
post-radiochemotherapy (Figure 2A). Separation of the
cohort according to the median (or any other threshold)
yielded no significant differences between CD8low and
CD8high tumors with regard to patient survival (Figure 2B,
2C). However, separation of the cohort into three terciles
results in a statistical trend (p < 0.0567) suggesting that
high infiltration by CD8+ T cells might have a negative
impact on patient survival (Figure 2D). At this stage,
we ignore whether this absent (or paradoxical) effect of
the CD8+ T cell infiltrate on patients survival reflects the
presence of dysfunctional (anergy or exhausted) T cells in
the tumor bed post-radiochemotherapy.

Negative impact of FOXP3+ T cells on the survival
of esophageal cancer patients

Absent (or paradoxical) effects of CD8+ T
lymphocytes infiltration on patients survival

There are numerous reports describing an increment
in the frequency of Tregs among tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes in esophageal cancers [23-25] and that
this increase may have a negative prognostic impact
[26]. This phenomenon augments with tumor stage [27,

28] and has a negative impact on overall survival [26].
Radiochemotherapy reduces the frequency of Tregs in the
center of tumor lesions [29], and this decrease correlates
with the median survival of the patients [30], perhaps
because of an improvement of immunosurveillance tied
to Treg depletion. In accord with the published literature,
we observed heterogeneity of the FOXP3+ Treg infiltrate
post-radiochemotherapy (Figure 3A), as well as a negative
correlation between the density of the Treg infiltrate and
cancer-specific survival (Figure 3B-3D). The frequency
of FOXP3+ T cells infiltrating the tumor (or its scar)
post-radiochemotherapy increased with tumor staging

(Figure 4A) but was not influenced by the number of
lymph node or distant metastases (Figure 4B, 4C). The
degree of the histological response to radiochemotherapy,
as assessed according to tumor regression grade (TRG)
system [31] (that attributes the lowest number to the
best response), also exhibited a negative correlation
with the Treg infiltrate, meaning that tumors showing a
complete regression (TRG 1) contained less Tregs than
tumors presenting incomplete (TRG 2-4) or absent (TRG
5) responses (Figure 4D). In sharp contrast, the CD8+
infiltrate did not correlate with any of these clinical
parameters (Supplemental Figure 3). Smokers and non-

Concluding remarks

smokers did not differ in the density of the FOXP3+
infiltrate (Figure 5A), while alcoholism apparently
increased this parameter (Figure 5B). While there was
no difference in the frequency of tumor-infiltrating Tregs
among patients with normal or loss-of-function alleles of
TLR4 (Figure 6A), patients bearing the mutated alleles of
P2RX7 exhibited an increased Treg infiltration (Figure
6B). Although this latter parameter does not improve risk
stratification of esophageal carcinoma patients (Figure
1B), it may indicate some impact of purinergic receptor
signaling on Tregs function [32].

The present paper adds to a series of reports on the
relevance of immunosurveillance for the fate of patients
afflicted by esophageal carcinoma. The preponderant
vision of the field is that this kind of malignancy is
subjected to immunosurveillance by CTL. Indeed, there
is some evidence for CTL-mediated immunoediting,
meaning that esophageal squamous cell carcinomas tend
to lose proteins required for the expression of MHC class I
molecules (such as ß-2 microglobulin, tapasin-1 and HLA
class I) [33]. However, this phenomenon, which correlated

with a reduction in CTL infiltration, had no impact on
the clinical course of the disease [34]. Additionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy of esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin increases
HLA class I expression as it induces infiltration by CD8+
T lymphocytes in the stroma [35].
When characterizing the immune infiltrate of
esophageal carcinomas post-radiochemotherapy, we
observed that the number of CD8+ T cells found in the
residual tumor or the scar was irrelevant for patient
survival. In sharp contrast, it appeared that the frequency
of FOXP3+ Tregs consistently correlated with the
therapeutic response (meaning that few FOXP3+ T cells
were found in those residual lesions that had responded
to radiochemotherapy) as well as with the cancer-specific
survival.
Previous work revealed that the frequency of Tregs
is positively correlated with their apoptosis resistance [36],
suggesting that their frequency is dictated by Treg-intrinsic
parameters. However, it has also been shown that the
number of Tregs is positively influenced by the presence
of the chemokines (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 17 and
CCL22 in the tumor microenvironment [37], indicating
that extrinsic factors may control their recruitment,
differentiation or survival within the neoplastic lesion. We
found that the level of expression of nuclear high mobility
group box 1 (HMGB1) and cytoplasmic microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B best
known as LC3B) puncta had no impact on the survival
of patients with esophageal cancer (Supplemental
Figure 4), nor on the frequency of intratumoral Tregs
(not shown), suggesting that these factors (which may
affect Treg infiltration in other tumors) [38, 39] have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

no impact on Treg biology in the context of esophageal
carcinoma. As a caveat, however, it has to be noticed that
the examination of such markers of cellular stress and
local immune function has only been performed at one
time point, on surgical specimen post-radiochemotherapy.
Hence, this delayed ‘snapshot’ might hide the entire, likely
complex sequence of tissue reactions that occur between
the radiochemotherapeutic intervention and the surgical
removal of the tumor.
Irrespective of the multiple incognita that the present
study fails to illuminate, there is convincing evidence that
Treg infiltration post-radiochemotherapy may be assessed
as an independent prognostic factor for an ever more
accurate risk stratification of esophageal carcinomas. This
result must be confirmed in an independent, prospective
multicenter study before its diagnostic implementation.

Materials and Methods
Patients and study design
One-hundred-night-six esophageal cancer patients
were enrolled into the study at the Claude Huriez
University Hospital (Lille, France) and written informed
consent was obtained from all the included patients
according to the local ethical committee. All patients
received neo-adjuvant radiochemotherapy consisting of
3 cycles of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin or oxaliplatin
combined with 45 Gys (median dose) of radiotherapy.
Patient characteristics are depicted in Table 1. Finally,

slides were washed in distilled water, and counterstained
with hematoxylin.

Immunohistochemical detection of HMGB1

Genotyping

FFPE cancer tissue sections were deparaffinized
in changes of xylène and rehydrated in absolute ethanol.
Antigen retrieval was carried out by heating slides for
30 min in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 98 °C. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was inhibited by incubation with 3%
hydrogen peroxidase (Dako, Trappes, France) for 15 min
and then washed twice for 5 min with 0.025% Triton (v/v
in TBS). Sections were then saturated 20min with Protein
Block Serum Free (Dako, Trappes, France). Without
washing, the primary antibody, a polyclonal rabbit anti
HMGB1 antibody (ThermoScientist Pierce, PA1-16926)
at the final concentration of 4µg/mL, was incubated
overnight. After two washes in 0.025% Triton (v/v in TBS)
sections were incubated by the secondary antibody (En
vision-Rabbit, Dako, Trappes, France) for 45min, Upon
two additional washes the peroxidase activity was revealed
by means of daminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (Dako,
Trappes, France), and the sections were counterstained
with Mayer’s hematoxylin.

Genomic DNA was isolated from formalin fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) esophageal cancer tissue blocks
by means of the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) and stored at -20°C in Tris-EDTA
(TE) buffer. Gene-specific Taqman® primers and genotypespecific probes (Applied Biosystems-Life Technologies
Inc.) were used to amplify (i) a TLR4 fragment containing
the Asp299Gly single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
(rs4986790), (ii) a P2RX7 fragment containing the
Glu496Ala SNP (rs3751143), (iii) an ATG16L1 fragment
containing the Thr300Ala SNP (rs2241880) and a PTPN22
fragment containing the Arg620Trp SNP (rs2476601). All
selected polymorphisms were amplified in a multiplex
PCR performed on StepOnePlus Real-Time (RT) PCR
System (Applied Biosystems-Life Technologies Inc.).
Genotypes were determined by comparing the signals from
fluorescent probes (FAM and VIC) and by calculating the
natural logarithm of the ratio between the FAM and VIC
signals [log (FAM/VIC)].

Immunohistochemical detection of LC3B

CD8 and FOXP3 immunohistochemical staining

Immunohistochemical staining of cancer tissue
sections was performed using the Novolink Kit (Menarini
Diagnostics, RE7140-K). Tissue slides were deparaffinized
in changes of xylène and rehydrated in decreasing
concentrations of absolute ethanol (100%, 95%, 80%,
70% and 50%). Antigen retrieval was carried out by
heating slides for 30min in pH 6.0 citrate buffer at 95°C.
Thereafter, sections were incubated for 5min with the
Peroxidase block reagent, and subsequently washed twice
for 5min with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v in PBS). Following
a 5-min-long incubation at room temperature with the
Protein block reagent, tissue sections were washed
twice for 5min with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v in PBS), and
then incubated overnight at 4°C with a primary antibody
specific for LC3B (clone 5F10, Nanotools, 0231-100),
dissolved in 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v in TBS) at the
final concentration of 25 µg/mL. This antibody recognizes
both the soluble (LC3-I) and the membrane-bound form
(LC3-II) of LC3B. After two washes in 0.1% Tween 20
(v/v in PBS), sections were incubated for 30min with the
Post Primary Block reagent, washed again (as previously
described) and incubated for 30 min with the horseradish
peroxidase-coupled polymer secondary antibodies. Upon
two additional washes, secondary antibodies were revealed
with the liquid DAB Substrate Chromogen system (10min
incubation). Finally, slides were washed in distilled water,
and counterstained with hematoxylin.

Paraffin-embedded esophageal cancer specimens
were assessed for the infiltration by CD8+ (Novocastra,
Newcastle, UK, M-NCL CD8295) performed on a
BenchMark XT automated immunostainer (Ventana,
Tucson, AZ, USA). Antigen retrieval was performed by
incubating slides in EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for 30 min at
95°C, then the primary antibody was incubated for 30
min. FOXP3+ regulatory T cells staining was manually
assessed using the Novolink Kit (Menarini Diagnostics,
RE7140-K). FFPE cancer tissue sections were
deparaffinized for antigen retrieval and then rehydrated
through graded alcohols to water. Antigen retrieval was
carried out by heating slides for 30 min in pH 9.0 citrate
buffer at 98 °C. The sections were incubated for 5 min
with the Peroxidase Block reagent, and subsequently
washed twice for 5 min with PBS. Following incubation
for 5 min at room temperature with the Protein Block
reagent, tissue sections were washed twice for 5 min
with PBS, and then incubated 1 hour at room temperature
with a primary antibody specific for FOXP3 regulatory
T cell (ab450, Abcam) at the final concentration of 4µg/
mL. After two washes with PBS, sections were incubated
for 30 min with the Post Primary Block reagent, washed
again as before and incubated for 30 min with Polymer
secondary antibodies. Upon two additional washes,
secondary antibodies were revealed with the liquid DAB
Substrate Chromogen system (10 min incubation). Finally,

Conflicts of Interest

FOXP3, CD8, HMGB1 and LC3B expressions
were independently assessed by a trained histologist (PD).
For CD8 and FOXP3 staining, slides were digitized with a
slide scanner (Hamamazou, Massy, France) and processed
with CaloPyx (Châtillon, France) software enabling whole
slide quantification. For HMGB1 staining, the pattern of
expression (nuclear or not) was evaluated in tumor cells:
strong nuclear staining of at least 50% of the tumor cells
was considered positive for HMGB1 tumor expression
(see results and Supplemental Figure 2). Concerning
LC3B, the intensity of LC3B puncta in tumor cells and
the percentage of tumor cells with detectable LC3B puncta
were assessed: the tumor was considered positive if LC3B
puncta was detectable in more than 10% of malignant
cells.

There is no conflict of interest.

Statistical analyses
All data manipulation, analyses and graphing were
performed within the R environment [40]. Prognosis
value of the SNPs on the esophageal cancer specific
survival (as defined as the time elapsed from the date of
diagnosis and death from cancer) was evaluated by Cox
proportional hazards modeling. Genotype incidences in
clinical descriptors were calculated with Firth’s penalizedlikelihood logistic regression [41]. Distributions of FOXP3
and CD8 were assessed by linear modeling or the Cuzick
test as appropriate. Estimation of an adequate cut-off that
optimally separates the cohort in 2 groups of poor and
good prognosis was performed according to the method
described in Hothorn and Lausen [42]. Additionally, Cox
regression models built after discretization of the marker
based on the population median and terciles are evaluated
and presented with their corresponding Kaplan Meier
survival curves. Estimated parameters are accompanied by
their 95% confidence intervals and p values are two-tailed
and considered significant when less than 0.05.
