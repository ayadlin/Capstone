ABSTRACT
To date, many different chemotherapeutic agents have been widely used as common
treatments for oral cancers. However, their therapeutic effects have been disappointing,
and these agents may have unwanted side effects. Among the many regulatory factors,
overexpression of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members may promote resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs in many tumors. The BH3 domain-only proteins effectively
antagonize their apoptotic activities. Therefore, there is substantial interest in developing
chemotherapeutic drugs that directly target pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins by mimicking the
BH3 domain and unleashing pro-apoptotic molecules in tumor cells. Among the numerous
available small molecule BH3 mimetics, ABT-737, a potent small molecule that binds to
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL with high affinity, has anti-tumor activity in a wide variety of cancer cells.
However, the effects of ABT-737 on human oral cancers and the underlying molecular
mechanisms have not previously been elucidated. In the present study, we observed
that inactivation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway using ABT-737 dramatically increased
the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bim via transcriptional and/or posttranslational
regulation, in a cell type-dependent manner, inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
of human oral cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
of the antitumor effects of ABT-737 on human oral cancers.

strategies targeting apoptotic signaling pathways
[2], such as through inhibiting anti-apoptotic survival
factors, which are likely overexpressed in many
tumors and may confer drug-resistant phenotypes
[2, 3]. Among these factors, pro-survival Bcl-2 family
proteins have attracted considerable attention. The
family, a group of structurally related proteins, consists
of the pro-apoptotic members Bax and Bak, which
contain the Bcl-2 Homology 3 (BH3) domain, and prosurvival members Bcl-B, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bcl-2, Bfl-1,
and Mcl-1 [4, 5]. Overexpression of pro-survival Bcl-2

INTRODUCTION
Apoptosis is a natural barrier that prevents
cancer cells from surviving and disseminating to other
tissues. However, cancer cells use various strategies
to avoid apoptotic cell death by modulating multiple
key regulators of the apoptotic signaling pathway.
Apoptosis evasion contributes to therapeutic resistance
to conventional chemotherapy and accounts for the
so-called ‘poor responders’ [1]. Therefore, there have
been recent attempts to develop effective anticancer

family members may drive tumorigenesis and resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs in many tumors [4, 5].
Suppression of pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins with
antisense oligonucleotides [6] or siRNA [7] has been
proposed to restrict their functions, but their application
in vivo remains problematic due to their relatively poor
stability, bioavailability, and rapid modification in biofluids.
The activities of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins
are effectively antagonized by the “BH3 domain-only”
proteins (i.e., Bad and Bim). The BH3-only proteins
can bind to and neutralize pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins,
resulting in the release and activation of pro-apoptotic
Bak and/or Bax. Therefore, there is substantial interest in
developing potential chemotherapeutic drugs that directly
target pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins by mimicking the BH3
domain to unleash pro-apoptotic molecules in tumor cells
[8–10]. These mimetics selectively and effectively attack
cancer cells, which are most likely because many cancer
cell types are primed for apoptotic cell death [11]. It has
been postulated that rapidly growing cancer cells tend to
activate the Bak/Bax pro-apoptotic signaling pathway,
the activation of which is counteracted by increased
levels of pro-survival Bcl-2 members. BH3-mimetics
selectively release Bak/Bax from their pro-survival Bcl2-like counterparts and allow them to promote apoptotic
cell death. Among the numerous available BH3 mimetics,
the best-characterized molecule is probably ABT-737,
which binds with high affinity (in the nmol/L range) to
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w and with weak affinity to Mcl-1
and BFL/A1 (1000-fold lower affinities) [12]. As a single
agent, ABT-737 has high anti-tumor activity in a wide
variety of cancer cells, such as lymphoma [13] and several
solid tumor cell types [14, 15]. However, the effects of
ABT-737 on human oral cancers and the underlying
molecular mechanisms have never been elucidated.
Around 90 percent of oral cancers may arise in
squamous cells called oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which is the most common
malignant tumor in salivary glands, is a less common cause
of oral cancer but is more serious when present. Because
oral cancer usually has low chemo sensitivity, the results
are commonly disappointing and therapeutic effects are
achievable in a only minority of patients [16] and are
accompanied by serious side effects [17, 18]. Therefore, in
the present study, we investigated, for the first time, the anticancer effect of ABT-737 in human squamous carcinoma
and mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the anti-cancer
effects of ABT-737 human oral squamous carcinoma and
mucoepidermoid carcinoma and cells, respectively. Moreover,
we also found that the effects of ABT-737 on human oral
cancer cells may be attributed to the regulation of Bim levels
by modulation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in a cell typedependent manner.

ABT-737 inhibits the growth of oral cancer cells
by inducing apoptosis
To assess the anti-proliferative potential of ABT737 on human mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MC-3) and
human oral squamous carcinoma (HN22) cells, both
cell lines were treated with various concentrations of
ABT-737. Cell viability was determined with the MTS
(Figure 1A) and trypan blue dye exclusion assays
(Figure 1B). ABT-737 inhibited MC-3 and HN22 cell
growth in a concentration-dependent manner after 24
hr. Qualitative estimation of ABT-737-induced apoptotic
cell death was obtained using the live/dead assay, which
differentially labels live (green) and dead (red) cells with
fluorescent dyes (Figure 1C). Apoptotic cell death was
also qualitatively estimated by DAPI staining for nuclear
condensation and fragmentation. ABT-737 treatment
resulted in significant DNA fragmentation compared to
untreated controls (Figure 1D). These results indicated
that ABT-737 might induce apoptosis-mediated cell
growth inhibition and offer a novel therapeutic agent to
suppress human oral cancer cells.

ABT-737 induces caspase-mediated apoptosis
in human oral cancer cells
Next, we investigated whether ABT-737-induced
apoptotic cell death depends on the caspase-mediated
pathway. Western blot results revealed that ABT-737
treatment induced the activation of initiator caspase
(caspase-9), effector caspase (caspase-3), and PARP
(substrate for caspase-3) in MC-3 and HN22 cells
(Figure 2A). To further confirm whether ABT-737-induced
cell death depends on caspase-mediated activation, MC-3
and HN22 cells were pre-incubated with the broadspectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK before ABT-737
treatment. Pretreatment of cells with Z-VAD-FMK
successfully attenuated ABT-737-induced caspase-3 and
PARP cleavage, suggesting that ABT-737 induces caspasedependent apoptosis in MC-3 and HN22 cells (Figure 2B).
Accumulating evidence shows that pro-caspase-9 is cleaved
into active caspase-9 in a cytochrome c-dependent manner
[19]. Thus, mitochondrial cytochrome c release is a key
step for the initiation of caspase 9-dependent apoptosis.
In this context, we investigated whether increasing
cytochrome c levels in cytosol might be the mechanism
by which ABT-737 promotes apoptotic cell death. The
subcellular localization of cytochrome c after ABT-737
treatment induction was studied using the fluorescent
dye MitoTracker, which accumulates in mitochondria.
Treatment of cells with ABT-737 resulted in the release
of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, which is
where it mediates caspase-dependent apoptosis (Figure 2C).

oligomer/complex in the apoptotic cells by causing

levels of dimeric Bax with or without treatment. ABT737 exposure significantly increased the level of dimeric
Bax compared to negative controls (Figure 3D). Taken
together, these results indicated that ABT-737 induced

Bim may activate bax signaling to mediate

phosphorylation [28]. Recently, it has been demonstrated
that Bim phosphorylation via ERK1/2 on serine 69 promotes
its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation
[29]. Next, we examined whether ABT-737 could regulate
the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in HN22 cells. ABT-737
treatment markedly suppressed the ERK1/2 phosphorylation
levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5C).
Interestingly, the suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
levels was tightly associated with decreased phosphorylation
levels of Bim on serine 69 (Figure 5C). Next, we applied a
potent activator of ERK/12 signaling to further demonstrate
its regulatory role in ABT-737-mediated Bim expression.
Activation of ERK1/2 signaling with TPA, a known MAPK
activator, successfully attenuated the ABT-737-induced
Bim dephosphorylation compared to controls (Figure 5D).
Consistently, we have shown that activation of ERK1/2
signaling by TPA treatment successfully attenuates ABT737-induced DNA fragmentation (Figure 5E) as well as the
-live/dead ratio (Figure 5F), indicating that ERK1/2 signaling
may play the primary regulatory role in the ABT-737-induced
pro-apoptotic Bim signaling pathway, acting as its upstream
regulator.

We investigated the effects of ABT-737 treatment
on the basal expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins
using Western blot analysis. Bim expression is associated
with ABT-737 treatment (Figure 4A); however, we did
not demonstrate any link between anti-apoptotic family
members (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and ABT-737 treatment
(Supplementary Figure S1). Bim is normally sequestered
to the microtubule-associated dynein motor complex in
the cytoplasm. Following certain apoptotic stimuli, Bim is
translocated to the mitochondria, where it causes cytochrome
c release and apoptosis [25]. Western blot analysis revealed
mitochondrial translocation of Bim from the cytoplasm after
ABT-737 treatment (Figure 4B). Consistent with the Western
blot analysis results, Bim (green fluorescence) was mainly
localized in the mitochondria of cells treated with ABT737, as shown by co-localization with the red–fluorescent
MitoTracker (Figure 4C). To more specifically address the
direct link between Bim and ABT-737-mediated apoptosis,
MC-3 and HN22 cells were pre-transfected with Bimspecific siRNA before ABT-737 treatment. Bim knockdown
successfully attenuated the ABT-737-induced activation of
the pro-apoptotic molecules Bax and cleaved PARP (Figure
4D). Therefore, Bim may act as an upstream modulator of
Bax-mediated apoptotic cell death.

Therapeutic effects of ABT-737 in a xenograft
model of human oral cancer
Based on these in vitro results, we further
investigated the in vivo antitumor effect of ABT-737
using a mouse xenograft model. ABT-737 (50 mg/kg)
was administered by systemic injections that were given
five times per week, and the tumor size was measured
for 30 days. Importantly, there was a significant and
consistent reduction in the tumor volume and weight in
the mice that were treated with ABT-737 compared to
the control groups (Figure 6A and 6B). In vivo xenograft
results also demonstrated that ABT-737 treatment
resulted in increased TUNEL-positive cells in tumor
xenografts (Figure 6C). Furthermore, to determine
whether and to what extent ABT-737 treatment affects
the expressions of Bcl-2 family proteins in vivo, we
also compared the relative expression levels of Bcl-2
proteins, such as Bax, Bim, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, in tumors
with or without ABT-737 treatment. Consistent with
our in vitro results, the relative expression levels of Bax
and Bim were significantly increased in the ABT-737
treated groups compared with those in the control groups
(Figure 6D). Moreover, ABT-737 treatment significantly
suppressed the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and
Bim in tumor xenografts (Figure  6E). No significant
mouse body (Figure 7A) or organ (Figure 7B) weight loss
was observed in the ABT-737-treated groups, indicating
that the ABT-737-associated toxicity was minimal. No
notable intergroup differences were observed among
the organs, indicating that there were no marked signs
of systemic toxicity at the ABT-737 dose used in this
study (Figure 7C). High levels of Bim expression were

ABT-737 regulates bim expression through
transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms
Previous studies suggest that ABT-737 inhibits the
growth of human cancers by increasing Bim expression
[26, 27], but it is unclear how Bim expression is regulated
by ABT-737 treatment. Therefore, we examined whether
ABT-737 treatment could affect the mRNA expression
level of Bim in both cell lines. Interestingly, the mRNA
levels of Bim were significantly increased in response
to ABT-737 treatment in a concentration dependent
manner in MC-3 cells; however, the Bim mRNA was not
affected by ABT-737 treatment in HN22 cells (Figure
5A). Next, to determine whether ABT-737 had an effect
on the initiation of Bim protein synthesis, HN22 cells
were preincubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide (CHX) before ABT-737 exposure. CHX
did not rescue Bim from the ABT-737-induced upregulation of protein levels (Figure 5B), indicating that
ABT-737 induces Bim up-regulation in a translationindependent manner in HN22 cells.

determine its precise biological targets and mechanisms
of action. We hypothesized that any therapeutic drugs

In this study we found that the anticancer effect of ABT737 on human oral cancer cells seems to be mediated
through the BH3 domain protein, Bim, which directly
activates Bax to trigger apoptosis rather than regulating
other Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.
Bim expression can be regulated by a dualcomponent mechanism involving transcriptional and
post-translational regulation resulting in the antitumor
activities of ABT-737 against human oral cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo. Especially, the best-characterized posttranslational modification that regulates Bim expression
is phosphorylation on serine 69, which promotes the
proteasome-dependent degradation of Bim. Previously,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

it was shown that activation of the ERK1/2 signaling
pathway promotes phosphorylation at serine 69 and
consequent proteasome-dependent degradation of Bim
[38–40]. Consistently, following treatment with ABT737, we found that Bim expression is post-translationally
upregulated in HN22 cells through ERK1/2 signaling,
allowing them to gain their full apoptotic function.
Phosphorylation at serine 69 via the ERK1/2 signaling
pathway seems to be a critical transduction step for Bim
turnover because serine 69 mutants are defective for
proteasome-dependent degradation, accumulate at higher
levels in cells and exhibit enhanced cell death by apoptosis
[29, 41]. Interestingly, in addition to promoting the post35676

Oncotarget

translational turnover of Bim in HN22 cells, the proapoptotic effect of ABT-737 seems to be mediated through
transcriptionally increased Bim expression levels in
MC-3 cells. Consistent with previous results [42–44], our
findings suggest that ABT-737-mediated Bim expression
may be in a cell type-specific manner (Figure 5).
An ideal therapeutic agent would specifically target
the cancer cells without causing overwhelming systemic
damage. However, most conventional chemotherapeutic
agents are associated with serious cytotoxicity, which
is largely due to the presence of their targets in normal
healthy cells. Specific actions with high efficacy are
needed for a good drug candidate because high selectivity
for its biological targets would be nontoxic to the patient
through limiting undesirable cytotoxicity. No significant
mouse body/organ weight loss (Figure 7A and 7B) and no
notable intergroup differences among organs (Figure 7C)
were observed in the ABT-737-treated groups, indicating
that there were no marked signs of systemic toxicity at
the dose used in this study. Importantly, high Bim levels
were observed in only tumors, whereas Bim expression
was virtually undetectable in other organs (Figure 7D),
supporting the highly specific in vivo on-target effects of
ABT-737. However, as ABT-737 targets the Bim/Bax proapoptotic signaling pathway, it could be expected to cause
cytotoxic effects in vivo that are associated with some of
the developmental abnormalities in mice lacking these
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [45, 46]. Therefore, more
detailed in vivo studies are needed to generate more direct
evidence for the undesirable side effects of ABT-737.
Interestingly, we also found that Bcl-xL and Bcl2 are not targeted by ABT-737 in either human oral
cancer cell line (Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore,
it would be reasonable to postulate that Bcl-xL and
Bcl-2 contribute to ABT-737 resistance in human oral
cancer. Mérino et al. [47] reported that increasing
Bcl-xL expression conferred resistance to ABT-737,
although Bim expression was also increased, in leukemic
cells, whereas Delft et al. [34] found that Bcl-xLoverexpressing embryonic fibroblasts were significantly
less sensitive to ABT-737-induced apoptosis than Bcl2-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, high expression
of Bcl-2 but not Bcl-xL correlates with sensitivity to
ABT-737 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [13, 48].
Additionally, Tahir et al. reported that high levels of
Bcl-xL correlate with sensitivity to ABT-263 (an orally
available analog of ABT-737) in lung carcinoma [49].
Therefore, it seems possible that Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 can
mediate resistance to ABT-737 in some cancer cell types
but that they are specifically targeted in others. More
detailed studies will be needed to dissect the roles of
ABT-737 resistance in human oral cancer.
The MAPK signaling pathway has received
considerable attention in recent years for the discovery
and development of cancer-related therapeutic agents

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

due to its potential to promote the proliferation and
survival of various cancer cell types [50]. Among each
element in the MAPK signaling cascades, ERK1/2
is considered an attractive target for developing
therapeutics against cancers due to its significant
pharmacological specificity and selectivity [51].
Although the precise mechanisms of how BH3
mimetics promote Bcl-2 family-mediated apoptosis
in human oral cancer cells are still largely unknown,
previous studies have established the role of the
ERK1/2 signaling pathway in regulating cancer cell
growth and apoptosis [52]. Recently, a link between
the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and Bim has been
suggested [53, 54]. Based on more recent evidence, the
inhibition of certain oncogenic proteins with specific
inhibitors inactivates the ERK1/2 signaling cascade and
increases Bim-mediated apoptotic cell death [55]. These
agents do not only directly target Bim transcription
itself they also suppress ERK1/2 signaling indirectly,
causing the inactivation of key signaling pathways
that reduce the Bim protein levels [54]. Therefore, it
is possible that the antitumor effects of ABT-737 on
the oral cancer cells may contribute to Bim regulation
both at the transcriptional and/or post-translational
levels via suppressing the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
In agreement with our hypothesis, ABT-737 exposure
markedly suppressed the phosphorylated ERK1/2
levels in HN22 human oral squamous cancer cells
(Figure 5C). Consistently, activation of the ERK1/2
signaling pathway with a potent MAPK activator TPA
was successfully attenuated by ABT-737-induced
Bim dephosphorylation (Figure 5D) and apoptosis
(Figure 5E and 5F) compared to the controls. As a
result, we conclude that inactivation of the ERK1/2
signaling pathway by ABT-737 treatment reduces the
Bim expression levels via both transcriptional and/or
posttranslational regulation in a cell type-dependent
manner, inducing the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
of human oral cancer cells (Figure 8). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the anticancer effects of ABT-737 on human oral cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and chemical treatment
MC-3 (human mucoepidermoid carcinoma) cells
were provided from Prof. Wu Junzheng (Forth Military
Medical University, Xi’an, China) and HN22 (human
oral squamous carcinoma) cells were obtained from
Prof. Chong Heon Lee (Dankook University, Cheonan,
Korea). MC-3 and HN22 cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Each cell
lines were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.
All experiments were prepared in cells cultured at

Figure 8: Schematic summary of the effects of ABT-737 on human oral cancer cells. The Bim expression levels were
significantly increased in response to ABT-737 treatment in MC-3 human mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells, whereas Bim phosphorylation
by ERK1/2 on serine 69 promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation in HN22 human oral squamous carcinoma
cells. The inactivation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway by ABT-737 treatment reduces the Bim expression levels via both transcriptional
and posttranslational regulation in a cell type-dependent manner, inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of human oral cancer cells.

membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST at
RT for 2 hr, and incubated with primary antibodies and
corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Antibodies against cleaved PARP, cleaved caspse-3,
cleaved caspase-9, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, p-ERK1/2
(Thr202/Tyr204), ERK1/2, p-Bim (Ser69), Bim, Bad and
Bid were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.,
(Charlottesville, VA, USA). Actin and α-tubulin antibodies
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Bax (6A7) antibody was from BD
Pharmingen™ (San Jose, CA, USA) and Cox4 antibody
was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The immunoreactive
bands were visualized by ImageQuant™ LAS 500 (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Trypan blue exclusion assay

Mitotracker staining

The growth inhibitory effect of ABT-737 was
determined with trypan blue solution (Gibco, Paisley,
UK). Detached cells were stained with trypan blue (0.4%),
and then viable cells were counted using a hemocytometer.

Cells were seeded in 4-well plates, and then
treated with DMSO or ABT-737 for 24 hr. To label
mitochondria, cells were incubated with 500 nM
MitoTracker®
Mitochondrion-Selective
Probes
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37°C for 45 min,
which passively diffuse across the plasma membrane
and accumulate in active mitochondria. After staining
live cells with a MitoTracker probes, cells were fixed
and permeabilized using a Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution
at 4°C for 1 hr. Cells were blocked with 1% BSA at RT
for 1 hr and incubated at 4°C overnight, followed by
incubation with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody
at RT for 1 hr. Cells were observed by fluorescence
microscopy with the appropriate filters for fluorescence
dye.

3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium (MTS) assay

Live/dead assay
The cytotoxicity of ABT-737 was determined
using Live/Dead & Viability/Cytotoxicity assay (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). The polyanionic
dye Calcein-AM is retained within live cells, producing an
intense green fluorescence through intracellular esterase
activity. Ethidium homodimer-1 enters cells with damaged
membranes and binds to nucleic acids, producing a bright
red fluorescence in dead cells. Briefly, cells were stained
with 2 μM Calcein-AM and 4 μM Ethidium homodimer-1,
and then incubated for 30 min at RT. Cells were analyzed
under a fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) with the appropriate excitation and emission
filters.

Detection of bax conformational change
Whole-cell lysates were extracted by lysis buffer,
and then proteins were analyzed by Western blot. For
detection of Bax conformational change, proteins were
detected using specific primary antibody for the active
form of Bax (6A7).

4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining
To detect of nuclear morphological changes of
apoptotic cells, cells were stained with DAPI solution
(Sigma-Aldrich, Louis, MO, USA). Briefly, detached cells
were fixed in 100% methanol at RT for 10 min, deposited
on slides, and stained with DAPI solution (2 μg/ml). The
morphological changes of apoptotic cells were observed
under a fluorescence microscopy.

Preparation of cytosolic and mitochondrial
fractions
To determine the effect of ABT-737 on Bax
translocation into mitochondria, cytosolic extracts
were prepared by plasma membrane extraction buffer
containing 0.05% digitonin at RT for 1 hr. The lysates
were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min to
separate supernatant containing cytosolic proteins. Pellets
were washed and resuspended by plasma membrane
extraction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at ice for
10 min, and then centrifuged 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min.
The supernatant from this last centrifugation contained the
mitochondrial proteins.

Western blot analysis
Whole-cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer
and protein concentration in each sample was measured
using a DC Protein Assay Kit (BIO-RAD Laboratories,
Madison, WI, USA). After normalization, equal amounts
of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and then

weight were measured. The tumors were measured along
the two diameter axis with calibers to allow a calculation
of tumor volume using the following formula: V = π/6
{(D + d)/2}3, where D and d were the larger and smaller
diameters, respectively.

To detect intracellular Bax oligomerization, cells
were suspended by conjugation buffer containing 10
mM EDTA. The lysates were maintained with 2 mM
Bismaleimide Crosslinker (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL, USA) for conjugation between sulfhydryl groups at
RT for 1 hr, and then extracted by lysis buffer for Western
blot analysis.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were analyzed
by TUNEL in situ apoptosis detection kit (Dead-End
Colorimetric TUNEL system, Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized
and rehydrated. The sections were incubated with
proteinase K for 15 min at RT and then the endogenous
peroxidase was block with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for
5 min. The digoxigenine-dUTP end labeled DNA was
detected using an anti-digoxigenin peroxidase antibody
followed by peroxidase detection with 0.05% DAB
containing 0.02% hydrogen peroxide. The sections
were counterstained with methyl green, and then the
brown-colored apoptotic bodies in the tumor sections
from control and ABT-737-treated mice were counted
using Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon Inc.,
Melville, NY, USA). Randomly five selected fields
were visualized under a light microscope at a 400
magnification and the number of positively stained cells
was counted.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
A control nonspecific siRNA and Bim-targeted
siRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Cells were seeded in 6-well
plates and transfected at 50% confluency with 50 nM
siRNA using siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). After transfection for 6 hr, cells were treated
with DMSO or ABT-737 for 24 hr.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted by easy-BLUE Total
RNA Extraction Kit (INTRON, Daejeon, Korea)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One
microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed by
TOPscript™ RT DryMIX (Elpis Biotech, Daejeon,
Korea), and the resultant cDNA was subjected to PCR
using HiPi PCR PreMix (Elpis Biotech, Daejeon,
Korea). The PCR condition of Bim was as follows:
(30 cycles: 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 62°C and 1 min
at 72°C), and the PCR condition of β-actin was as
follows: (28 cycles: 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C
and 1 min at 72°C). The primer sequences were used:
Bim sense 5′-ATG GCA AG CAA CCT TCT GA-3′,
Bim anti-sense 5′-CTG TCT GTG TCA AAA GAG3′, β-actin sense 5′-GTG GGG CGC CCC AGG CAC
CA-3′, β-actin anti-sense 5′-CTC CTT AAT GTC ACG
CAC GAT TTC-3′. The intensities of each band were
normalized to β-actin. The amplified products were
analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained
with ethidium bromide.

Immunohistochemistry
Unstained tissue sections were deparaffinized,
treated with 100% alcohol, and washed with PBS. For
antigen retrieval, sections were boiled in citric buffer (pH
6.0) for 10 min using a hot plate and then cooled for 1 hr at
RT. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with peroxidase
blocking solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min, and the
sections were treated with protein blocking solution for
20 min. p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and p-Bim (Ser69)
antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) were applied
overnight at 4°C and sections were incubated using
secondary antibodies 1 hr at 37°C. Sections were then
stained with freshly prepared DAB substrate (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark), counterstained with Mayer’s
hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted and examined
under a light microscope.
