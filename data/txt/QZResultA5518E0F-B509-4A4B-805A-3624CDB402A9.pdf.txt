Abstract:

Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with dismal
prognosis. GBM patients have a median survival of less than 2 years.
GBM is characterized by fast cell proliferation, infiltrative migration,
and by the induction of angiogenesis. MicroRNAs and polycomb group
(PcG) proteins have emerged as important regulators of gene expression.
Methods: Here we determined that miR-101 is down-regulated in GBM,
resulting in overexpression of the miR-101 target PcG protein EZH2, a histone
methyltransferase affecting gene expression profiles in an epigenetic manner.
Results: Inhibition of EZH2 in vitro by pre-miR-101, EZH2 siRNA, or
small molecule DZNep, attenuated GBM cell growth, migration/invasion,
and GBM-induced endothelial tubule formation. In addition, for each
biological process we identified ontology-associated transcripts that
significantly correlate with EZH2 expression. Inhibition of EZH2 in
vivo by systemic DZNep administration in a U87-Fluc-mCherry GBM
xenograft mouse imaging model resulted in reduced tumor growth.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that EZH2 has a versatile function in GBM
progression and that its overexpression is at least partly due to decreased
miR-101 expression. Inhibition of EZH2 may be a potential therapeutic
strategy to target GBM proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.

PcG proteins are important epigenetic regulators
which can function as transcriptional repressors that silence
specific sets of genes through chromatin modification
[9]. PcG proteins are grouped in polycomb repressive
complexes (PRC). PRC2 includes enhancer of zeste 2
(EZH2), suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), and embryonic
ectoderm development (EED). EZH2 is the catalytically
active component of PRC2 and is capable of trimethylating
lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) when in complex with
SUZ12 and EED [10-15]. Recently, an increasing number
of studies linked various oncogenic properties to EZH2,
including impaired cellular differentiation and enhanced
proliferation and in vivo tumor growth [16-22]. EZH2
is overexpressed in various cancers, which correlates to
decreased patient survival [16,18,19,23-25]. Although
EZH2 knock down was shown to be embryonic lethal in
mice [26], knock down of EZH2 in cancer cells resulted
in growth arrest, as well as in diminished tumor growth
and reduced metastasis in vivo [16,20,22]. The role of

biological behavior of these tumors has led to a variety of
studies on the basic mechanisms involved. GBM cells are
highly proliferative but are also notorious because of their
capacity to migrate through the brain parenchyma and
their ability to induce angiogenic blood vessel sprouting.
Several factors are involved in the angiogenesis process,
which results in recruitment, proliferation and alignment
of endothelial blood vessel cells through a complex
interaction between endothelial cells and tumor cells [2].
miRNAs comprise a large group of endogenous
non-coding RNAs that can block mRNA translation or
negatively regulate mRNA stability and thereby play a
central role in the regulation of gene expression [3]. It is
also becoming clear that deregulated miRNA expression
is a common feature of human diseases, especially
in specific forms of cancer [4,5]. Recent studies have
identified several miRNAs that are altered in GBM tumor
cells themselves [6,7] as well as in GBM-associated

PcG proteins in GBM is not well understood, but has
been described to involve bone morphogenetic protein
signaling, controlling the differentiation capacity of GBM
cells [27].
Here we report that EZH2 expression in GBM
is regulated by miR-101. We show that miR-101 is
down-regulated in GBM cells, resulting in increased
EZH2 expression and enhanced GBM cell proliferation,
migration, and angiogenesis.

(Fig. 1A). Increased EZH2 expression correlated with
glioma grade and glioma recurrence (Fig. 1B), suggesting
that EZH2 could be a marker for glioma aggressiveness.
In addition, the Rembrandt database was used to show that
EZH2 expression correlated with decreased GBM patient
survival (Fig. 1C). EZH2 protein was strongly expressed
in human GBM cell lines, including U251 and U87, but
not in NNB (Fig. 1D).
In order to determine whether potential GBMexpressed miRNAs could affect EZH2 expression we
first determined which miRNAs expressed in NNB are
differentially expressed in GBM (Supplemental Table
S1A). Next, we used miRbase [28] to identify 63 miRNAs
predicted to target EZH2. Upon integration of the list of
miRNAs predicted to target EZH2 and the differential
GBM/NNB miRNA expression ratios, we found that
miR-101, miR-98, miR-137, and miR-139 were downregulated in GBM tissue as compared to NNB and have

Results
To evaluate the expression levels of EZH2 in GBM
cells and non-neoplastic brain (NNB) we performed
immunohistochemistry for EZH2 protein expression on
tissue microarrays containing GBM and NNB samples.
Most of the GBM samples showed fields of strong nuclear
staining for EZH2 while none of the NNB samples did

To determine the effects of EZH2 on GBM cell
proliferation we first analyzed which genes associated
with cell proliferation correlated with EZH2 expression in
GBM and NNB [35]. First, EZH2 was found overexpressed
in most GBM samples as compared to NNB. However, in
few samples the EZH2 mRNA expression was found to be
in the same range as in the NNB (Fig. 3A). Out of the 1419
genes that were linked to the proliferation gene ontology
as determined by AmiGO [36], 214 genes showed a
clear correlation (>67%) with EZH2 expression in GBM
(Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the GBM samples with normal
EZH2 expression levels also showed less expression
of the genes associated with cell proliferation. Next,
cellular proliferation was studied in GBM cell cultures to
determine if EZH2 influences the proliferation of GBM
cells. miR-101 induction, EZH2 knock down by siRNA
and treatment with DZNep significantly reduced cellular
proliferation in U87-GFP GBM cells (Fig. 3B and 3C).
The effect of DZNep treatment on proliferation inhibition
was confirmed in other GBM cell lines in vitro (Fig. 3D).
To determine the effects of EZH2 on GBM cell
migration we analyzed which genes belonging to the
migration gene ontology correlated with EZH2 expression

(Fig. 5A). Next, HBMVECs were cultured in EBM,
EGM, or EBM supplemented with U87 human GBM cells
expressing GFP (U87-GFP), all on a Matrigel substratum
to promote tubule network formation. Tubules were
visualized by a combination of light and fluorescence
microscopy. After pre-treatment of the GBM cells with
DZNep, or transfection with pre-miR-101, EZH2 siRNA,
or non-related oligonucleotides of similar chemistry, and
subsequent co-culturing with HBMVECs on Matrigel,
we analyzed tubule length and tubule branching. Upregulation of miR-101 in U87-GFP cells resulted in a
substantial decrease in total tubule length and tubule
branching (Fig. 5B and 5C). In addition to pre-miR-101,
treatment of the U87-GFP cells with EZH2 siRNA and
DZNep also inhibited U87-induced tubule network
formation (Fig. 5B and 5C).
Finally, to study the effects of modulation of EZH2
on GBM growth in vivo, we implanted U87 human
GBM cells stably expressing Fluc and the fluorescent
protein mCherry (U87-Fluc-mCherry) into the flanks of
nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored over time by
intravenous injection of the Fluc substrate D-luciferin and

in GBM and NNB. A significant correlation between the
expression of 28 out of 279 genes associated with cell
migration and EZH2 expression was observed (Fig. 4A).
In order to determine whether miR-101 up-regulation
or EZH2 inhibition also affected GBM cell migration,
scratch assays were performed. Up-regulation of miR101 by pre-miR-101 resulted in a significant decrease in
U87 migration. The EZH2 inhibitors DZNep and EZH2
siRNA showed a similar decrease in migration (Fig. 4B
and 4C). To further evaluate the effects of miR-101/EZH2
modulation on in vitro migration and invasion, a Boyden
chamber assay was used. U87 cells that were transfected
with pre-miR-101 showed a significant decrease in ability
to invade, as visualized by Hoechst staining (Fig. 4D and
quantitated in 4E). Again, similar results were observed
after treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep or EZH2
knock down by siRNA (Fig. 4D and 4E).
To determine the effects of EZH2 on GBM-induced
angiogenesis we also analyzed which genes belonging
to the angiogenesis gene ontology correlated with EZH2
expression in GBM. Again, a significant correlation
between the expression of 33 out of 308 genes associated
with angiogenesis and EZH2 expression was observed

After tumor cell implantation, we injected one set of mice
(n = 5) intravenously with the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep
(0.07 mg/kg) and a parallel control set (n = 5) with PBS
only, at day 3, 5, and 7, followed by weekly injection.
CCD camera imaging of Fluc bioluminescence activity in
the tumor allowed us to monitor tumor growth over time.
The tumor volume of the mice treated with PBS increased
logarithmically over time, while the tumor volume in the
mice treated with DZNep showed reduced growth (Fig.

[30], bladder transitional cell carcinoma [31], gastric
cancer [37], and described to strongly correlate with
migration, invasion, and metastasis [30,37]. Here we
demonstrate a role for EZH2 overexpression in GBM,
which could be inhibited by miR-101, siEZH2, or
small molecule inhibitor DZNep. Besides induction of
migration and invasion, we identified a role for EZH2 in
cellular proliferation and the induction of angiogenesis,
indicating a versatile pro-tumoral function for EZH2 in
GBM. Inhibition of EZH2 by DZNep resulted in reduced
GBM growth in vitro and in a limited experiment in vivo.
Altogether, these results indicate that EZH2 may be a
useful drug target for the treatment of GBM.
miRNAs are know to affect cellular processes
such as angiogenesis [8,38,39]. Here we show a role for
miR-101 in GBM-induced angiogenesis. Unpublished
data indicate that miR-101 also regulates EZH2 in
endothelial cells. We provide evidence that miR-101
down-regulation regulates angiogenesis by induction of
EZH2 and a pro-angiogenic mRNA profile. However, the
exact mechanisms of EZH2 function in endothelial and
GBM cells remains to be investigated. Besides miR-101,
we also found the predicted EZH2 targeting miRNAs
miR-98, miR-137, and miR-139 to be down-regulated in
GBM cells as compared to NNB tissue. It remains to be

Discussion
Here we show that miR-101 is down-regulated
in glioma in a grade dependent manner. The impaired
translational repression of EZH2 by miR-101 causes EZH2
overexpression in GBM, which correlates with patient
survival. EZH2 is a methyltransferase that affects the
expression of many genes. Based on in silico expression
analysis and EZH2 expression correlation we found
that EZH2 overexpression induces glioma proliferation,
migration/invasion, and angiogenesis, processes driving
glioma progression.

investigated whether these miRNAs truly repress EZH2,
and whether other previously identified miR-101 target
genes are also repressed by miR-101 in GBM cells, these
may include Cox-2, Mcl-1 and Fos [37], MAGI-2 [40],
DNA-PKcs and ATM [41], COX-2 [42]. The complex
interaction of reduced miR-101-mediated translational
repression and increased EZH2-mediated transcriptional
repression at least seem to cause pro-tumoral switches
in the GBM transcriptome profile. Interestingly, our
results also identified that a subset of GBMs express
normal levels of EZH2 mRNA. We found that the genes
associated with proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis
were also expressed in the normal range, following the
EZH2 expression levels. Further research in the nature
and behavior of this subset of EZH2-low GBMs and its
correlation to miR-101 expression is warranted.
In conclusion, our results indicate that EZH2 has
a versatile pro-tumoral function in GBM and that its
overexpression is at least partly due to decreased miR101 expression. Inhibition of EZH2 may be a potential
therapeutic strategy to target GBM proliferation,
migration, and angiogenesis.

2.3 Western blots and immunohistochemistry.
EZH2 protein and H3K27me3 expression was
detected by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot
analysis, using mouse anti-EZH2 monoclonal antibody
(BD biosciences) and rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (Upstate
Biotechnology). Mouse anti-Actin (Millipore) was used
as a loading control. Protein levels were detected using
ECL detection solution (GE healthcare) and visualized on
X-ray film (GE healthcare). Paraffin sections of human
GBM tissue and NNB were incubated with monoclonal
mouse anti-EZH2 (BD biosciences) antibodies. Positive
reactions were visualised using a secondary antibody
(DAKO EnvisionHRP) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine or
liquid red chromogen.

Materials and methods
Cells

miRNA modulation

Human brain microvascular endothelial cells
(HBMVECs; Cell Systems ACBRI-376) were cultured in
EGM medium (Lonza). C6, 293T, MCF-7, U118, U251,
U373, and U87 cells (U-87 MG; ATCC) were cultured
in DMEM (Lonza) containing 10% FBS and antibiotics.
U87-Fluc-mCherry cells were produced by stably
transducing U87 cells with CMV-controlled expression
cassette using a lentiviral vector [43].

50 nM of pre-miR-101 (Ambion) or pre-miR-control
(Ambion) oligonucleotides were transfected into U87
human GBM cells using Lipofectamin2000 (Invitrogen),
according the manufacturer’s protocol. For the inhibition
of EZH2 50 nM of EZH2 siRNA (Qiagen) was transfected
into U87 cells. siRNA-AF or control oligonucleotides
(Qiagen) were used as controls. After 5 h of transfection,
the transfection medium was replaced by DMEM until
further analysis.

Quantitive RT-PCR
Quantitive RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was used
to determine the relative expression levels of miR-101,
miR-186, EZH2, and GAPDH mRNA. Total RNA was
isolated using the miRVANA miRNA isolation kit. Equal
amounts of RNA were converted into cDNA using miR101, miR-186, EZH2, and GAPDH RT primers (Applied
Biosystems and Qiagen, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol). Subsequently, quantitive PCR was performed
using primers and materials from Applied Biosystems. All
experiments were performed using biological triplicates
and experimental duplicates. The data was normalized to
miR-186 or GAPDH expression levels.

In silico analysis
A RNA microarray dataset containing 81 GBM and
23 NNB samples as published by [35] was used to obtain
mRNA expression estimates. To quantify the differential
level of expression for each glioblastoma sample, the
significance analysis of microarrays algorithm was
performed using the samr package (version 1.24 by B.
Narasimhan and R. Tibshirani) in R, A Language and
Environment for Statistical Computing (release 2.4.1;
Vienna, Austria; http://www.R-project.org) based on
randomization. Unpaired two class comparison for cancer
versus normal tissue samples was performed, unless paired
samples were involved, in which case a paired analysis

DZNep (5 µM for 24 h), starved for 24 h and harvested
in serum free medium. Per insert 25,000 GBM cells were
subsequently placed on the membrane. The inserts were
immersed in a 24-well plate that was filled with EGM
growth medium culture media. After incubation for 24 h,
the membrane was washed briefly with PBS. The upper
side of the membrane was then wiped gently with a cotton
ball. The membrane was then fixed in 4% formaldehyde
and stained with Hoechst. The magnitude of GBM cell
migration was evaluated by counting the migrated cells in
3 random high-power (5x) microscope fields.

was performed. The selection of the delta parameter was
based on a median false discovery rate less than 0.05.
The default number of 100 permutations was used. This
resulted in fold change values for all 19769 genes on the
Affymetrix microarray platform. Using the AmiGO tool
[36] of the Gene Ontology project [44] lists of transcripts
associated with the biological processes proliferation
(GO:0008283; 9/20/10), migration (GO:0030334;
9/20/10) and angiogenesis (GO:0001525; 9/20/10) were
obtained. Lists of unique transcripts were prepared by
removing duplicate entries. Subsequently the microarray
dataset was queried for the genes in each of these
ontologies. Samples were sorted on EZH2 expression
level for the NNB and GBM samples separately and the
average expression levels scaled on a gene by gene basis
for genes significantly correlating with EZH2 expression
(absolute value Pearson correlation > 0.667) were plotted
as a heatmap using the gplots package in R.

Tumor model and bioluminescence imaging
All animal studies were approved by the
Massachusetts General Hospital Review Board. Nude mice
were anesthetised with i.p. injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg)
and ketamine (100 mg/kg). 50 µl containing 1 x 106 U87Fluc-mCherry cells were pre-mixed with an equal volume
of matrigel (BD biosciences) and implanted in the flanks
of nude mice. DZNep was administered intravenously to
tumor-bearing mice at a dose of 0.07 mg/kg diluted in 100
µl PBS at day 3, 5 and 7 after tumor implantation, followed
by weekly injection. Mice were anesthetized as above and
Fluc imaging was performed 10 min after intravenous
injection of 150 µl beetle D-luciferin (4 mg/kg body
weight) (Xenogen), and recording photon counts over 5
min using a cooled CCD camera with no illumination.
Dim polychromatic illumination was used to take a light
image of the animal. Visualization was performed using
CMIR-Image, a program developed by the Center for
Molecular Imaging Research using image display and
analysis suite developed in IDL (Research Systems Inc.,
Boulder, CO). An intensity contour procedure to identify
bioluminescence signals with intensities significantly
greater than the background was used to define regions of
interest. The mean, standard deviation and sum of photon
counts in these regions were calculated as a measurement
of Fluc activity.

In vitro angiogenesis assay
HBMVECs were cultured on Matrigel (BD
biosciences) in EBM (Lonza) in the presence or absence
of U87-Fluc-mCherry cells, or EGM (Lonza). The
experiments were performed in triplicate, repeated twice
and judged in a double blind fashion by at least two
observers. At least 3 pictures were taken randomly of
each culture well using a digital camera system (Leica).
Total tubule length and number of branches were analyzed
using the software program ImageJ.

In vitro migration assay
GBM cells were grown to confluence in 24-wells
plates and were transfected with 50 nM of oligonucleotides
or treated with DZNep (5 µM). At 72 h after transfection
an artificial wound was created using a pipette tip after
which the cells were further incubated. To analyse cell
migration into the scratched area, pictures were taken at
0 and 24 h using a digital camera system coupled to a
microscope. ImageJ was used to determine the migration
distance (in μm) as the reduction of the width of the open
area.

Statistics
Difference in biological properties between
parental and EZH2 downregulated cells was analysed
using Student’s t-test. P-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

In vitro invasion assay
GBM invasion function was analyzed using a Boyden
chamber assay. A 24-well Transwell system (Corning) was
used, with each well containing a permeable transwell
insert containing a 6.5 mm polycarbonate membrane
with 8 μm pores. The inserts were coated with 4x diluted
basement membrane extract (Trevigen) and incubated
overnight in 5% CO2 at 37ºC. GBM cells were transfected
with 50 nM of oligonucleotides for 24 h or treated with
