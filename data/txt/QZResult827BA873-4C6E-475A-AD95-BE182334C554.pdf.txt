ABSTRACT
The traditional methods of drug discovery follow the “one drug-one target”
approach, which ignores the cellular and physiological environment of the action
mechanism of drugs. However, pathway-based drug discovery methods can overcome
this limitation. This kind of method, such as the Integrative Penalized Matrix
Decomposition (iPaD) method, identifies the drug-pathway associations by taking
the lasso-type penalty on the regularization term. Moreover, instead of imposing
the L1-norm regularization, the L2,1-Integrative Penalized Matrix Decomposition (L2,1iPaD) method imposes the L2,1-norm penalty on the regularization term. In this paper,
based on the iPaD and L2,1-iPaD methods, we propose a novel method named L1L2,1iPaD (L1L2,1-Integrative Penalized Matrix Decomposition), which takes the sum of
the L1-norm and L2,1-norm penalties on the regularization term. Besides, we perform
permutation test to assess the significance of the identified drug-pathway association
pairs and compute the P-values. Compared with the existing methods, our method
can identify more drug-pathway association pairs which have been validated in the
CancerResource database. In order to identify drug-pathway associations which
are not validated in the CancerResource database, we retrieve published papers to
prove these associations. The results on two real datasets prove that our method can
achieve better enrichment for identified association pairs than the iPaD and L2,1-iPaD
methods.

genes and the systemic nature of human diseases. In
general, pathways are defined as the interaction of multiple
genes, that is, pathways can be regarded as the target of
drugs [3, 4]. Abnormal biological pathways can provide
views for the aberrant imbalance underlying diseases and
find targets for complex diseases intervention [5].
Compared with the “one drug-one target” methods,
the systematic biology approach takes the drug effects
into the global physiological environment account [6].
These existing computational methods for identifying
drug targets include the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) method [7], the FacPad method [2], the iFad
method [5] and the iPaD method [8], etc. The GSEA

INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of data generated from
genetic analyses and functional genomics, identifying
drug targets has become more and more feasible [1].
The modern drug discovery has found thousands of drug
targets and the clinical testing agents. These agents can
produce curative effects via regulating different targets
in various biological and related diseases of pathways.
Traditional drug discovery methods follow the “one drugone target” line. But many complex diseases are related to
dysfunction of multiple pathways rather than individual
genes [2]. These methods ignore the relationship among

method has several disadvantages. Firstly, for every paired
drug-pathway association, calculation must be done once
at every turn. Secondly, the genes which belong to the
same pathway will have the common weights, therefore,
when a subblock of genes serve as the critical interaction
groups for a specific drug. In summary, the GSEA method
is time-consuming and inaccurate. The FacPad method
has been proposed to identify drug-pathway association
pairs, and it develops a sparse Bayesian factor analysis
model to deal with treatment response data that are derived
from microarray platforms [2]. And the iFad method is
also a sparse Bayesian factor model, which is proposed to
infer the drug-pathway association using gene expression
and drug sensitivity data. In literature [5], the authors
apply this method on the NCI-60 data set. The gene
expression and drug sensitivity data are downloaded from
the CellMiner database [9] (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/
cellminer). The iFad method is effective in identifying
paired drug-pathway associations. Since this method uses
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [10] to perform
statistical inferences, it is computationally expensive.
Also it has many turning parameters which should be
specified by users. In order to improve the algorithm
speed and performance, a method named iPaD (integrative
Penalized Matrix Decomposition) is proposed by Li et
al.[8] to identify paired drug-pathway associations. The
iPaD method applies the integrative penalized matrix
decomposition method to analyze the gene expression
data and the drug sensitivity data. The scalable bi-convex
optimization algorithm is used to solve the objective
function. Since the L1-norm penalty can produce sparsity,
the L1-norm regularization item is added on the drugpathway association matrix. By applying the iPaD
method on the NCI-60 and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE) datasets, Li et al. [8] prove that the iPaD method
performs better than the iFad method in computational
efficiency and identifying drug-pathway association
pairs. Since the L2,1-norm regularization can penalize
each row of the matrix as a whole and can enhance
the sparsity among the rows [11], based on this theory,
a method named L2,1-iPaD (L2,1-integrative Penalized
Matrix Decomposition) is proposed to identify paired
drug-pathway associations [12]. The L1-norm penalization
can produce scattered and unstructured sparsity matrix,
yet L2,1-norm penalization can produce structured row
sparsity matrix [11]. Moreover, the sum of the L1-norm
and L2,1-norm penalization can produce row structure
with intra-row sparsity. In this paper, for the purpose of
enhancing the sparsity of the drug-pathway association
matrix and improving the performance of the method, we
use the sum of the L1-norm regularization and L2,1-norm
regularization instead of the L1-norm regularization. In this
article, a novel method named “L1 L2,1-iPaD” is proposed
to identify paired drug-pathway associations. Our method
has the following advantages. Firstly, for the first time, we
propose the L1 L2,1-iPaD method by replacing the L1-norm
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regularization with the sum of the L1-norm regularization
and L2,1-norm regularization. Secondly, the L1 L2,1-iPaD
method can be used to analyze gene expression and drug
sensitivity data. Thirdly, it gives an effective method to
identify drug-pathway association pairs. Experimental
results in two real datasets prove that the L1 L2,1-iPaD
method is effective.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Firstly, we will introduce two real datasets, give out
the experimental results and show the comparison of
our method with the state-of-art methods. Then we will
provide discussion of this article and outline the future
works. And thirdly, we will introduce the notations and
definitions in this paper. Finally, we will describe the
related works and methodology of the L1 L2,1-iPaD.

THE INTRODUCTION FOR DATASETS
CCLE data set
The CCLE data set is downloaded from the CCLE
project, which is a competitive resource to implement
a detailed genetic characterization for a large panel
of human cancer cell lines. The CCLE project (http://
software.broadinstitute.org/software/cprg/?q=node/11) can
provide public access analysis, visualization of DNA copy
number, mutation data, mRNA expression, and so on, for
about 1046 cancer cell lines. The CCLE data set consists
of 480 cell lines with drug sensitivity data for 22 drugs
and transcription data for 1802 genes covering 58 KEGG
pathways. In fact, the CCLE data set in the CCLE project
contains 18988 genes and 24 chemical drugs. The detailed
data processing can be found in [8]. The drug sensitivities
are measured by area over the dose-response curve
(‘activity area’). EC 50 , IC50 and maximum activity area
(‘ Amax ’) can also measure drug sensitivities. But activity
area has two advantages. Firstly, it has less missing values.
Secondly, it can both reflect drug potency and efficacy.
But EC 50 and IC50 can only reflect drug potency, and Amax
can only reflect its efficacy. In this paper, the density of
the gene-pathway association prior knowledge matrix
H (1) is 3.95%. And for the drug-pathway association prior
2
knowledge matrix H ( ) , we set it to zero.

NCI-60 data set
The NCI-60 data set contains 57 cell lines with
gene expression data for 1863 genes covering 58 KEGG
[13] pathways and drug sensitivity data for 101 drugs.
The NCI-60 data set is from the NCI-60 project, which
provides various type of ‘Omics’ features of 60 cell lines
with 9 different cancer types. The gene expression data
and the drug sensitivity profiles are downloaded from the
CellMiner database [9]. The detailed data processing can
be found in [5]. The drug sensitivity data are obtained by
GI 50 values, those values can reflect the potency of drugs.

the authors in [16] suggest that cotreatment with LBH589
and 17-AAGcan induce more apoptosis of IM-resistant
primary CML-BC and acute myeloidleukemia cells than
treatments with either agent alone. And in this paper, our
new method also can find that 17-AAG is associated with
the Chronic myeloid leukemia pathway. Moreover, the
drug-pathway pairs corresponding to nonzero elements
in the matrix B( 2) are selected as the identified drugpathway association pairs. In this experiment, our method
identifies 413 drug-pathway pairs that have p-value no
more than 0.05, and 70 drug-pathway pairs are validated
in the CancerResource database. The L 2,1-iPaD method
identifies 368 drug-pathway pairs that have p-value no
more than 0.05, and 66 drug-pathway pairs are validated
in the CancerResource database. However, iPaD identifies
88 drug-pathway pairs that have p-value no more than
0.05, and only 25 drug-pathway pairs are validated in the
CancerResource database. When we set the P-value cutoff
as 0.005, 51 drug-pathway association pairs are identified
by the iPaD method, with 16 association pairs validated
in the CancerResource database. But for our method and
the L 2,1-iPaD method, 53 drug-pathway association pairs
are identified, with 16 association pairs validated in the
CancerResource database. In addition, in [8], we can
easily find that the results of iFad and GSEA methods are
poorer than the iPaD method, so in this paper, we does not
compare our method with the iFad and GSEA methods.
Then we compute the identification and verification
rates of drug-pathway association pairs on the CCLE
data set. Specifically, we make the ratio of number of
identification (or verification) and total number of drugpathway pairs as the identification (or verification) rate.
The identification and verification rates of drug-pathway
association pairs on the CCLE data set for the L1 L2,1-iPaD,
L2,1-iPaD and iPaD methods can be found in Table 2
and Table 3. It is obvious that our method can identify
more drug-pathway association pairs than other existing
methods.

The GI 50 is defined as the needed concentration for 50%
of maximum cell growth inhibition. The drug sensitivity
data values are equal to the log10 ( GI 50 ) . Higher values
mean higher drug sensitivity of the cell lines. Besides, the
density of the gene-pathway association prior knowledge
matrix H (1) is 3.95%. And the density of the drug-pathway
association prior knowledge matrix H ( 2) is 0.51%.

RESULTS
In this Section, we evaluate the performance of our
proposed L1 L2,1-iPaD method by applying to the CCLE
and NCI-60 datasets. To show the effectiveness of our
proposed method, we also compare our method with the
iPaD and L2,1-iPaD methods in this Section.

The results on the CCLE data set
In this experiment, we first use the five-fold crossvalidation to obtain the optimal λ1 and λ2 values, and
then obtain the sparse drug-pathway association matrix
B( 2) corresponding to the optimal parameter values.
Similar to the iPaD and L2,1-iPaD methods, our method
also can assess the relative importance of the coefficients
in the drug-pathway association matrix B( 2) via solving
the L1 L2,1-problem for a decreasing λ sequence. For
each λ value, we record the order of the coefficients
in which they become nonzero. In general, the more
important coefficients ought to become nonzero earlier
than the less important coefficients. However, this
procedure cannot be used to assess the significance of
the coefficients. Therefore, we perform permutation test
to assess the significance of the coefficients in the drugpathway association matrix B( 2). In this paper, we run
2000 permutations to obtain the P-values. The P-values
of our method, the L2,1-iPaD and iPaD methods on the
CCLE data set are listed in Table 1, in which the superior
results are shown in bold type. In this paper, the known
drug-pathway associations are served as the validated
information. In Table 1, the drug named Nutlin-3 is
related with the Chronic myeloid leukemia pathway. A
published paper suggests that Nutlin-3 can up-regulate
the expression of Notch1 in both lymphoid and myeloid
leukemic cells for a part of the negative feedback
antiapoptotic mechanism [14]. Besides, the authors in
[15] confirm that IAP inhibition using a small synthetic
inhibitor (LBW-242) increases the sensitivity of CML
cells to TKI. This drug-pathway association pair is not
validated in the CancerResource, but our method can find
their associations. And in Table 1, only 5 drug-pathway
association pairs are validated in the CancerResource.
For the rest 10 drug-pathway associations which are not
validated in the CancerResource, we retrieve published
papers to prove their associations. Only one association
pair is not found from published papers. Besides, similarly,

The results on the NCI-60 data set
Similar to the L2,1-iPaD and iPaD methods, we also
apply our method to the NCI-60 data set. For the NCI60 data set, we also run 2000 permutation to evaluate
the significance of the coefficients in the drug-pathway
association matrix B( 2). The P-values of our method,
the L2,1-iPaD and iPaD methods on the NCI-60 data set
are listed in Table 4. The authors in [17] prove that the
mechanism of action of the EA derivatives prepared
in this study is more complex than the inhibition of
glutathione S-transferase p ascribed as unique effect
to EA and might help to overcome tumor resistances.
And in Table 4, Melphalan is associated with T cell
receptor signaling pathway. A study published in 2003
suggests that Melphalan can control the expression of
T cell receptor signaling pathway [18]. In Table 4, only

6 drug-pathway association pairs are validated in the
CancerResource. For the rest 9 drug-pathway associations
which are not validated in the CancerResource, we
retrieve published papers to prove their associations.
Only one pair associations are not found from published
papers. So, our method can also identify associations,
which are not validated in CancerResource, in the NCI60 data set between drugs and pathways. For example,
a paper studied in 2000 writes that an in vitro study the
effects of MPA (Mycophenolic acid) on human peripheral
blood lymphocyte activation markers and on cell cycle
characteristics are investigated [19]. Moreover, the drugpathway pairs corresponding to nonzero elements in the
matrix B( 2) are selected as the identified drug-pathway
association pairs. In this experiment, our method identifies
593 drug-pathway pairs that have p-value no more than
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

0.05, and 163 drug-pathway pairs are validated in the
CancerResource database. The L 2,1-iPaD method identifies
562 drug-pathway pairs that have p-value no more than
0.05, and 163 drug-pathway pairs are validated in the
CancerResource database. However, iPaD identifies 247
drug-pathway pairs that have p-value no more than 0.05,
and only 74 drug-pathway pairs are validated in the
CancerResource database. And when we set the P-value
cutoff as 0.005, the results of our method is similar to the
L 2,1-iPaD method, but the number of identification and
verification are higher than the iPaD method. Similar to
the CCLE data set, we also compute the identification and
verification rates of drug-pathway association pairs on the
NCI-60 data set. The identification and verification rates of
drug-pathway association pairs on the NCI-60 data set for
the L1 L2,1-iPaD, L2,1-iPaD and iPaD methods can be found
in Table 5 and Table 6.

DISCUSSION

For the matrix M ∈ R d ×n, the L1-norm of a matrix was
first presented in [20], whose definition can be written as

Identifying drug-targets is a momentous issue for the
bioinformatics and a crucial step for the drug discovery. In
this paper, we proposed a novel method named “L1 L2,1-iPaD”
to identify the paired drug-pathway associations, and used it
to jointly analyze the gene expression and drug sensitivity
data. In addition, for the L1 L2,1-iPaD method, two parameters
need to adjust. So, we use five-fold cross-validation to
choose the optimal parameters. Besides, we perform
permutation test to assess the significance of the identified
drug-pathway association pairs. In order to evaluate the
performance of our method, we apply it to two real datasets,
including the CCLE and NCI-60 datasets. Moreover, we
compare our method with the iPaD and L2,1-iPaD methods.
The experimental results demonstrate that our method is
superior to the iPaD and L2,1-iPaD methods. Our method
can identify more drug-pathway association pairs which
are validated in the CancerResource database than other
methods. Besides, for the rest drug-pathway associations
which are not validated in the CancerResource database, we
retrieve published papers to prove their associations.
With the development of the high-throughput
technology, more and more genomic data sets are
generated from various fields. At present, one of our
central task is to develop the feasible and efficient method
to analyze them. Our method is one of the useful ways
for identifying drug-pathway association pairs. In the
future, we will develop more efficient and robust methods
to jointly analyze high dimensional data and to solve the
computational challenges.

where E(1) and E( 2) are the error matrices. B(1) and B( 2)
denote the gene-pathway association and drug-pathway

Since the gene-pathway association information
is available and complete, the central interest lies in
the inference of the matrix B( 2), that is, the paired drugpathway associations. We further consider enhancing
the sparsity of the matrix B( 2). Thus, we add the L1-norm
regularization to impose the penalty among all elements in
the matrix B( 2) and propose our new L1 L2,1-iPaD method.
The objective function of the L1 L2,1-iPaD method is defined
as follows:

method [8] used the traditional gradient descent method
to optimize X. Here, we also apply the gradient descent
method to solve this problem. The objective function of
Eq.(10) can be written as follows:

Since the L2,1-norm penalty can produce rows
sparsity [25], another effective method named L2,1-iPaD is
proposed to identify the novel drug-pathway association
pairs [12]. In this paper, the L2,1-norm regularization
is used to replace the L1-norm regularization to enforce
sparse constraint on rows. And it modifies the optimization
problem (7) as follows:

where λ1 and λ2 are two adjustable parameters, which
can increase or decrease the sparsity of the matrix B( 2). In
general, the bigger the λ1 and λ2 are, the more sparse the
2
matrix B( ) is. Optimization problem (9) is convex. That
1

is, when we fix B( ) and B( ), optimizing X is a convex
1

problem, and when we fix X, optimizing B( ) and B( ) are
both convex optimization subproblems. Since it is difficult
to directly obtain the solution, an effective method is
proposed to solve the optimization problem in Eq.(9).

prior knowledge matrix H (1) ∈ {0,1}
is an indicating
matrix, that is, the matrix H (1) is used to indicate elements
1
in the matrix B(1) . If H i(, j) = 1, it indicates that the j-th gene
1
is associated with i-th pathway. However, if H i(, j) = 0 , it
indicates that the j-th gene is not associated with the i
-th pathway. The authors in [8] assume that the known
gene-pathway associations are complete, so, they pay
attention to discover the novel drug-pathway associations.
Therefore, the second constraint condition is used to
incorporate known gene-pathway associations. Besides,
the first constraint condition is used to guarantee that the
model is identical.

where B( 2) is the L1-norm of the matrix B( 2). λ is a
1
crucial parameter and used to adjust the sparsity of the
matrix B( 2). In general, the bigger the value of λ is, the
more sparse the matrix B( 2) is. Since a drug is usually
related to a few pathways, the matrix B( 2) may be sparse.
Because the L1-norm can produce sparsity, the authors in
[8] add the L1-norm constraint on the matrix B( 2). And, the

For the part of B( 2) being indicated by H ( 2) , the
problem is written as follows:

X k +1 = X k +1 X k +1 . The Nesterov’s method [26] can
achieve a convergence rate becoming 1 t 2 (The original
convergence rate is 1 t). So, when we update X, we also
apply this method to quicken the convergence speed.

For the part of B( 2) being indicated by 1 − H ( 2) , we will

Therefore, we finally compute B( 2) by optimizing B1, that
is, B( 2) = D−1 2 B1. We sum up the L1 L2,1-iPaD method as the
Algorithm 1. Besides, in this paper, we also use the softimpute algorithm to deal with the missing values problems
in solving X. The detailed steps can be found from the
iPaD [8] and L2,1-iPaD methods [12].

In order to simplify the optimization problem (22),
we set X1 =XD-1 2 and B1 =D1 2 B( 2). Then, the problem (22)
can be equivalent to the following minimization problem:

In order to use the prior knowledge on the drug-pathway
associations (matrix H ( 2) ), we add the L2-norm on the

to use the prior knowledge matrix H (1) to optimize B(1)

we optimize each column of B(1), separately. The problem

Compared with the iPaD and L2,1-iPaD methods, our
new L1 L2,1-iPaD method has two adjustable parameters
(λ1 and λ2), which can control the sparsity of the drugpathway association matrix B( 2). In this paper, We perform
five-fold cross-validation to find the suitable parameters.
In the five-fold cross-validation, we divide the matrix Y ( 2)
into 5 folds. At each round of the cross-validation, we
make each of the 5 folds as missing values, and the rest
of 4 folds as training data. It is obvious that it is difficult
to find the optimal parameters λ1 and λ2, simultaneously.
Therefore, we solve the L1 L2,1-iPaD problem to produce a
λ1 sequence by fixing λ2, and then we use five-fold crossvalidation to find an optimal parameter λ1. We treat the
minimum residual sum of squares (RSS) corresponding
to the λ1 value as the optimal value. Similarly, we find
an optimal parameter λ2 by fixing λ1. Since our method
is a sparse optimization algorithm, there are many zero
coefficients in the matrix B( 2). We usually treat those
nonzero coefficients as the identified core drug-pathway
association pairs. After searching for the optimal
parameters, we perform permutation test [27] to assess
the significance of the coefficients. We first obtain the
estimated value of the matrix B( 2), and then compute
the P-value of the coefficient for the matrix B( 2), the
computational formula is as follows:
