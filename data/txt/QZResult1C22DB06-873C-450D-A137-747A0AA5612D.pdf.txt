Abstract
The sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is activated in f30% of
human medulloblastoma resulting in increased expression of
downstream target genes. In about half of these cases, this has
been shown to be a consequence of mutations in regulatory
genes within the pathway, including Ptc1, Smo, and Sufu.
However, for some tumors, no mutations have been detected in
known pathway genes. This suggests that either mutations in
other genes promote tumorigenesis or that epigenetic alterations increase pathway activity in these tumors. Here, we
report that 3% to 4% of mice lacking either one or both
functional copies of Cxcr6 develop medulloblastoma.
Although CXCR6 is not known to be involved in Shh signaling,
tumors derived from Cxcr6 mutant mice expressed Shh pathway target genes including Gli1, Gli2, Ptc2, and Sfrp1, indicating elevated pathway activity. Interestingly, the level of Ptc1
expression was decreased in tumor cells although two normal
copies of Ptc1 were retained. This implies that reduced CXCR6
function leads to suppression of Ptc1 thereby increasing
Smoothened function and promoting tumorigenesis. We used
a direct transplant model to test the sensitivity of medulloblastoma arising in Cxcr6 mutant mice to a small-molecule
inhibitor of Smoothened (HhAntag). We found that transplanted tumors were dramatically inhibited in mice treated for
only 4 days with HhAntag. These findings suggest that HhAntag
may be effective against tumors lacking mutations in known
Shh pathway genes. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3871–7]

Introduction
Medulloblastoma, a primitive neuroectodermal tumor that arises
in the cerebellum, is the most common malignant brain tumor of
childhood. Current therapy is associated with long-term deleterious side effects particularly in young children (1, 2), and therefore it
is important to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. Smallmolecule inhibitors that target cell signaling pathways aberrantly
activated in medulloblastoma could be very useful in the future
management of this disease. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway
provides a unique opportunity for intervention because it is
activated in f30% of human medulloblastoma, based on gene
expression signatures (3, 4). Using the Ptc1 +/ p53 / mouse model

of medulloblastoma (5), we conducted a proof-of-principle
preclinical study of a small molecule (HhAntag) that binds to
and inhibits Smoothened (6–8) thereby down-regulating the Shh
pathway (9). Remarkably, HhAntag eliminated spontaneous
medulloblastoma in these mice after only 2 weeks of oral dosing
(9). Similarly, HhAntag was very effective at reversing the growth of
transplantable mouse medulloblastoma (10). In contrast, we found
that it did not affect growth of medulloblastoma cell lines because
the Shh pathway is down-regulated when tumor cells are placed in
culture (9, 10).
Mutations in patched-1 (PTCH1) occur in f10% of sporadic
human medulloblastoma (11–14). Other components of the Shh
pathway, including suppressor of fused (SUFU; ref. 15) and SMO
(16), which also result in pathway activation, have been
described. However, half of the tumors in which the Shh pathway
is activated fail to show any mutations in the known pathway
members (4). This indicates that there are either mutations in
unknown genes that regulate Shh signaling, directly or indirectly,
or that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to tumorigenesis. In
addition, mutation of several genes involved in cell cycle control
and DNA repair in mice promotes medulloblastoma formation,
and in some of these cases, it seems that tumors lose one or
both copies of Ptc1, resulting in increased Shh pathway activity
(3, 17–23). Thus, the Shh pathway can be activated in tumors in
a number of ways.
Here, we characterize Cxcr6 mutant mice, which were generated
as a part of the Lexicon Genome5000 program using the pKOS
gene-targeting system (24), and we report that heterozygous or
homozygous mutation of Cxcr6 causes a low (3–4%) incidence of
medulloblastoma. CXCR6 (also named BONZO, STRL33, or
TYMSTR) is a chemokine receptor that was identified as the
principal coreceptor for several strains of human and simian
immunodeficiency viruses (25–27). Its normal biological function is
unclear and gene ablation studies indicated no obvious phenotypes
(28). Although the tumors arising in Cxcr6 mutant mice express
several Shh pathway signature genes, both normal copies of Ptc1
are present. However, the expression level of Ptc1 is low, indicating
the possibility of epigenetic suppression in these tumors. We found
that directly transplanted medulloblastoma cells derived from
Cxcr6 mutant mice responded to treatment with HhAntag. This
implies that altered CXCR6 function led to suppression of Ptc1
expression, which in turn increased Shh pathway activity, thus
promoting medulloblastoma formation.

Experimental Procedures

the Lambda KOS system previously described by Wattler et. al. (24).
Briefly, the targeted embryonic stem cell clone (derived from the
129/SvEvBrd strain), containing a LacZ-Neo cassette in place of
exon 2 of the Cxcr6 gene (Fig. 1A), was microinjected into host
blastocysts. The resulting chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6J
albino mice to achieve germ line transmission of the Cxcr6
mutation. The mice used in this study were of mixed genetic
background (129/SvEvBrd and C57BL/6J). All mouse studies were
carried out according to protocols approved by the institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees at Lexicon Genetics and St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital.
Genotyping of mice. Genomic DNA samples (10 Ag) isolated from
targeted embryonic stem cells were digested with HindIII or EcoRV
and analyzed by Southern blotting. Probes for Southern blotting were
generated by genomic PCR. Primer sequences used in this experiment
included 5¶-CCTCTGCTGCAAACCTATTC-3¶ and 5¶-AAACCGTGTGCCCAGAACG-3¶ for probe-I and 5¶-TATAGGCAGCTTGGTACTATC-3¶ and 5¶-ACTGTGGTCAGCAGCCGAG-3¶ for probe-II. Routine
genotyping of mice was done by PCR using three primers (F1,
5¶-CTGTCAGTACCACAGTGAGG-3¶; R1, 5¶-AACCGTCATGACCTTGATTTC-3¶; and F2, 5¶-GCAGCGCATCGCCTTCTATC-3¶), which
resulted in 765-bp (F1/R1) and 389-bp (F2/R1) products from the
wild-type and targeted alleles, respectively.
Histologic analysis and immunohistochemistry. Mice were
perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and then the brains were
removed, postfixed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned in the
sagittal plane, as previously described (9). Paraffin sections were
stained with H&E using standard histologic protocols and
processed for immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for

glial fibrillary acidic protein (Shandon Immunon, Waltham, MA)
and synaptophysin (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark).
Allograft propagation and HhAntag treatment. Six-week-old
female athymic nude mice (CD1 nu/nu; Charles River Breeding
Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) were injected s.c. in the flank with
suspended tumor cells (3  106) derived from a Cxcr6 +/ mouse.
Tumor sizes were measured and tumor volumes were calculated as
previously described (10). Cohorts of mice bearing allografts with
volumes in the 200 to 400 mm3 range were treated with vehicle
alone (n = 2) or with 100 mg kg 1 HhAntag (n = 4) twice a day for
4 days by oral gavage. Four hours after the last dose, mice were
euthanized and allografts were harvested. HhAntag was obtained
from Curis (Boston, MA) and Genentech (South San Francisco, CA).
Cell culture. Medulloblastoma cells derived from a Cxcr6 +/
mouse were cultured as previously described (29), and total RNA
was isolated after three passages.
Northern blotting and in situ hybridization. Gene expression
was evaluated by Northern blotting (30) and in situ hybridization (9, 31) as previously described. Antisense RNA probes for
Cxcr4 (corresponding to Ala102-Leu273 of mouse CXCR4) and Fyco1
(corresponding to Met1211-Pro1437 of mouse Fyco1) were synthesized with the Strip-EZ RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Other probes
were previously described (9, 10, 30).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Expression of Cxcr6 and lacZ
mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using
a Superscript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Primer sequences used in this experiment included 5¶-ATGTTTGCCCCAACAGATG-3¶ and 5¶-CTAGAGTTGGAACATACTGGTGG3¶ for mouse Cxcr6 and 5¶-ATGGAAGATCCCGTCGTTTTAC-3¶ and

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) were previously
described (32).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. A probe specific
for the Patched-1 gene was prepared from a bacterial artificial
chromosome (ResGen Mouse BAC clone, 241013; Invitrogen) by
labeling with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) using nick translation. A biotinylated probe specific for
mouse chromosome 13 (386H1O; BACPAC Resources, Oakland, CA)
was used as an internal control for the fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) assays. Both labeled clones were combined
with sheared mouse DNA and hybridized to 5-Am-thick paraffin
sections. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating
the slides with fluorescein-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody
(Roche Applied Science) and Texas red-avidin (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). The paraffin sections were then stained with 4,6diamidino-2-phenylindole and analyzed.
Microarray gene expression analyses. Total RNA was prepared
from developing cerebella (postnatal day 5) from wild-type mice

and from medulloblastomas derived from Cxcr6 +/ (n = 2) and
Ptc1 +/ mice (n = 2). The samples were then hybridized with the
Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (45101 probe sets; Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA) and analyzed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite
version 5.0 (MAS v5) and Spotfire 8.1 software, as previously
described (10, 33). To identify the changes in gene expression, the
numbers of probe sets scored as up-regulated (>2-fold increase,
log ratio >1), down-regulated (>2-fold decrease, log ratio <1), and
unchanged ( 0.5 < log ratio < 0.5) were counted for each
comparison (medulloblastoma versus developing cerebellum).
Log ratios of signal are log 2 ratios of geometric means of the
stabilized signals, which were generated using STATA/SE 8.2 for
Linux. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited
in National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression
Omnibus5 and are accessible through Gene Expression Omnibus
Series accession no. GSE7212.

Results
Cxcr6 mutant mice were generated as a part of the Lexicon
Genome5000 program, which uses gene knockout technology to
investigate the physiologic and behavioral functions of 5,000 human
genes through analysis of the corresponding knockout mouse
models. A targeting vector containing a LacZ-Neo cassette was used
to replace exon 2 of the Cxcr6 gene via homologous recombination,
eliminating >90% of the protein coding region (Fig. 1A). Southern
blot (Fig. 1B) and PCR (Fig. 1C) analyses were used to confirm
correct targeting of the Cxcr6 gene. Cxcr6 +/ and Cxcr6 / mice,
born at the expected Mendelian ratios, were viable and fertile and
did not immediately exhibit an evident phenotype. Targeting of the
Cxcr6 gene was confirmed by RT-PCR using total RNA prepared from
mouse spleen, which expresses high levels of Cxcr6 (25, 27). RT-PCR
analyses showed that spleens from wild-type (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3)
and heterozygous (Fig. 1D, lanes 4 and 5) mice expressed Cxcr6
mRNA, but spleens from homozygous mice did not (Fig. 1D, lanes 6
and 7). As the targeted alleles contain a lacZ gene, we also did RTPCR using specific primers for lacZ. Spleens from both homozygous
and heterozygous mice expressed lacZ (Fig. 1D, lanes 4–7).
Heterozygous mice seemed to make less Cxcr6 RNA than wild-type
mice (although the assay is semiquantitative at best).
Exon 2 of Cxcr6 is located within intron 14 of Fyco1 in the mouse
and human genomes in an antiparallel transcriptional orientation
(34, 35). We found that wild-type Fyco1 is expressed at normal levels
in the adult cerebellum of Cxcr6 / mice using Northern blotting
(Supplementary Fig. S1), RT-PCR, and DNA sequencing (data not
shown) approaches. Thus, we conclude that the phenotype
observed in Cxcr6 mutant mice is likely a consequence of the
reduced level of Cxcr6 expression because Fyco1 is unchanged.
Previously, Unutmaz et al. (28) described mice in which Cxcr6
(Bonzo) was replaced with a gene encoding green fluorescent
protein. These mice did not exhibit any obvious pathologies and,
subsequently, they were used to investigate the function of CXCR6
in T-cell subsets. These studies led to the proposal that CXCR6 and
its ligand CXCL16 play important roles in lung lymphocyte homing
(36, 37) and liver-based immune responses (38) although the precise
mechanism of action is unclear. We observed our Cxcr6 mutant
mice for a period of 12 months and made the surprising observation
that a small number of both heterozygous and homozygous mice

develop brain tumors. This phenotype may have been missed by
other investigators because the penetrance is low, the age of onset
varies, and the cause of death can only be ascertained by careful
examination of the brain. The tumors arose consistently in
cerebellum (Fig. 2A) and, histologically, they resembled Ptc1 +/
tumors, composed of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei
and scant cytoplasm. Both Cxcr6 +/ and Cxcr6 / mice developed
brain tumors between the ages of 12 and 39 weeks, with a frequency
of 4.2% and 2.9%, respectively (Table 1). The peak incidence

occurred between 16 and 20 weeks and there was no significant
difference in tumor incidence or time of onset between homozygous
and heterozygous mice. We also found that all tumors examined
(Cxcr6 +/ , n = 1; Cxcr6 / , n = 4) stained positive for both glial
fibrillary acidic protein and synaptophysin (Fig. 2B) and they
expressed Gli1 and Sfrp1 mRNA (Fig. 2C) similar to Ptc1 +/ tumors
(14, 39, 40). Based on the histologic appearance, location, and
expression of markers, we concluded that tumors arising in Cxcr6
mutant mice were medulloblastomas.
To investigate the mechanisms responsible for medulloblastoma
formation in the Cxcr6 mutant mice, we compared the expression
levels of Shh pathway genes with those in developing (Fig. 3A, lanes
1–3) and adult (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6) cerebella. The genotype of each
sample was confirmed by RT-PCR analyses of both Cxcr6 and lacZ
(Fig. 3B). Northern blot analysis showed that medulloblastomas in
Cxcr6 / (Fig. 3A, lane 7) and Cxcr6 +/ (Fig. 3A, lanes 8 and 9)
mice expressed high levels of Gli1 and Sfrp1, consistent with the
results of in situ hybridization studies (Fig. 2C). The mRNA levels of
Gli2, Ptc2, and Cxcr4, whose up-regulation has been reported in
other mouse medulloblastomas and in a subset of human
medulloblastomas (3, 4), were also increased (Fig. 3A). The levels
of these genes (Gli1, Gli2, Ptc2, Sfrp1, and Cxcr4) were very similar
to those observed in Ptc1 +/ medulloblastoma (Fig. 3A, lane 10),
indicating that the Shh pathway was activated in medulloblastomas arising in Cxcr6 mutant mice. Medulloblastomas observed in
other mouse models have been reported to arise as a consequence
of either direct or indirect activation of the Shh pathway leading to
increased expression of downstream target genes, and one or both
copies of Ptc1 were lost in some of these cases (3, 17–23, 40, 41).
We also found that the mRNA levels of Ptc1 were decreased in all
medulloblastomas tested from Cxcr6 mutant mice (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–
9). In fact, the level of Ptc1 expression in these tumors was
comparable to that previously seen in tumors from Ptc1 +/ mice
(Fig. 3A, lane 10; ref. 30). This finding raised the possibility that one
of the Ptc1 alleles may be lost or mutated in Cxcr6 mutant
medulloblastomas. However, FISH analysis showed that both Ptc1
alleles were present in medulloblastomas from Cxcr6 mutant mice
(Fig. 3C). Furthermore, RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing analyses
failed to reveal any mutations in Ptc1 or Sufu in the four tumors
examined (Cxcr6 +/ , n = 3; Cxcr6 / , n = 1), suggesting that, in
Cxcr6 mutant mice, aberrant activation of the Shh pathway occurs
indirectly by down-regulation of Ptc1 expression.
Gene expression profiles of medulloblastomas arising in
Cxcr6 +/ mice (n = 2) were compared with those of Ptc1 +/
medulloblastomas (n = 2). We tabulated the number of probe sets
scored as up-regulated, down-regulated, and unchanged, comparing each type of medulloblastoma to genes expressed in developing
cerebellum (see Experimental Procedures for details). To exclude
potential chip errors, we eliminated probes whose expression levels
were not consistent between the two independent samples of each
tumor. Specifically, 10,244 probes met the criteria described above.
We found that the gene expression profiles of medulloblastomas

derived from these two mouse models were very similar, with
expression levels of 1,080 probes up-regulated, 1,453 downregulated, and 7,006 unchanged, comparing both types of
medulloblastomas to developing cerebellum (Table 2). Furthermore, expression levels of the Shh pathway–related genes were
essentially the same between Cxcr6 +/ and Ptc1 +/ medulloblastomas (Supplementary Table S1), which is consistent with Northern
blot analyses (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, 6.9% (705 of 10,244) of
probes were differentially expressed (Table 2), and Supplementary
Table S2 shows the probes whose expression levels were different
between two types of medulloblastomas (log ratio >3). It is possible
that some of the listed genes may contribute to the aberrant
activation of the Shh pathway and development of medulloblastomas in Cxcr6 mutant mice.
Microarray gene expression analysis provides a useful means to
identify tumors containing specific gene mutations that are
amendable to molecular targeted therapies. Because gene expression profiles, including the activation of the Shh pathway, are very
similar between Cxcr6 +/ and Ptc1 +/ medulloblastomas, it is a

reasonable assumption that the medulloblastomas derived from
Cxcr6 mutant mice might respond to treatment with Shh pathway
inhibitors. Previously, we showed that medulloblastomas arising in
Ptcl +/ p53 / mice responded to treatment with the Shh pathway
inhibitor (HhAntag; ref. 9). However, as the tumor incidence in
Cxcr6 mutant mice is very low and loss of p53 did not accelerate
medulloblastoma formation (data not shown), it is not feasible to
treat spontaneous tumors arising in Cxcr6 mice with the inhibitor.
Therefore, we propagated the Cxcr6 +/ medulloblastoma cells in
the flank of nude mice. Previously, we reported that directly
transplanted medulloblastomas from Ptc1 +/ p53 / mice closely
resemble the parental tumors, both histologically and in terms of
gene expression profiles (10). As a first step, we confirmed that the
Shh pathway activity was maintained in the flank allograft (directly
transplanted from fresh medulloblastoma) by testing the expression
levels of Gli1 and Sfrp1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the Shh
pathway activity could not be maintained in medulloblastoma
culture (Fig. 4B, lane 3), indicating that cultured medulloblastoma
cells are not suitable for testing the HhAntag, consistent with our

previous studies (9, 10). To evaluate the effect of HhAntag on
medulloblastomas derived from Cxcr6 mutant mice, cohorts of
mice bearing tumor allografts were treated with 100 mg kg 1
HhAntag twice daily. We found that the mRNA levels of Gli1 and
Sfrp1 in allografts were clearly reduced after treatment with eight
doses of 100 mg kg 1 HhAntag (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7). After
treatment, the transplanted tumors rapidly lost volume (Fig. 4A),
indicating that the Shh pathway inhibitor was very effective in this
model of medulloblastoma.

Discussion
Over the past several years, there has been increasing hope that
molecular targeted therapies will prove efficacious in the treatment
of specific cancers. However, one of the greatest challenges facing
the field is to identify the specific tumor subsets that are capable of
responding to the treatment. Previously, we tested a smallmolecule inhibitor of the Shh pathway (HhAntag) in a spontaneous
mouse model of medulloblastoma (9). These mice carried germ line
mutations in the Ptc1 and p53 genes and they responded
dramatically to treatment with HhAntag. In addition, we found
that allograft tumors, derived directly from Ptc1 +/ p53 / mice but
not tumor cell lines, were completely eliminated after a few oral
doses of the drug (10). Although promising, these studies may only
be specifically relevant for the 10% of human tumors that carry
PTCH1 mutations. However, f30% of human medulloblastomas
exhibit a gene expression signature consistent with Shh pathway
activation (3, 4). This raises the possibility that HhAntag may have
broader application than just the tumor subset associated with
heterozygous loss of Ptc1 or other known mutations in the Shh
pathway. Here, we show that mice with heterozygous or
homozygous mutations in Cxcr6 develop a low frequency of
medulloblastomas. Remarkably, these tumors show high levels of
expression of Shh pathway target genes but they do not harbor
mutations in Ptc1 or Sufu. Although the Ptc1 locus is intact in the
tumors, the levels of Ptc1 mRNA are quite low. Thus, we speculate
that impartial or complete loss of Cxcr6 function leads indirectly to
suppression of Ptc1 expression thereby activating the Shh pathway
and promoting medulloblastoma formation. Tumors from these
mice provide a model for testing the usefulness of HhAntag against
medulloblastomas lacking known mutations in the Shh pathway.
The role of CXCR6 in human medulloblastoma is unclear at
present. Microarray and semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses
revealed that mRNA levels of Cxcl16, which encodes a ligand for
CXCR6 (42), are elevated in medulloblastoma arising in both
Ptc1 +/ and Cxcr6 mutant mice, compared with normal developing
cerebellum (data not shown). Because chemokines and their
receptors mediate signals critical for the recruitment of effector
immune cells to the site of inflammation, it is possible that loss of
such receptors provides a selective advantage to the tumor cells.
Indeed, the deletion of chromosome 3p21.3, which contains a large

cluster of chemokine receptors including the CXCR6 gene (35), has
been observed in several human cancers (43, 44). Thus, it is
possible that some human medulloblastomas might harbor
deletions in the chromosome 3p21.3 region.
Surprisingly, we were unable to accelerate development of
medulloblastoma in Cxcr6 mutant mice by crossing onto a p53
null background. This was unexpected as loss of p53 dramatically accelerated medulloblastoma formation in Ptc1 +/ mice
(5). In addition, several other mouse models with homozygous
loss of p53 have been reported, including p53 / Rb / (17), Lig4 /
Lig4 / p53 / (18), Ink4c / p53 / (19), and Parp1 / p53 /
mice (20). Although genetic instability resulting from inactivation
of the p53 pathway contributes to neoplastic transformation of
granule cell precursors (5, 41), the precise molecular mechanism
is unclear. It is possible that loss of Cxcr6 also promotes
medulloblastoma formation in a similar manner to loss of
p53 and, therefore, tumorigenesis is not further accelerated by
loss of p53.
The low tumor frequency in Cxcr6 mutant mice precluded drug
studies in the spontaneous tumor background. However, using
directly transplanted medulloblastoma cells, we were able to show
that medulloblastoma cells harboring Cxcr6 mutations responded
well to treatment with HhAntag. The Shh pathway remained active
and gene expression profiles were maintained in medulloblastoma
cells directly transplanted from tumors. In contrast, cultured
medulloblastoma cells from Cxcr6 mutant mice did not maintain
Shh pathway activity, so they could not be used for HhAntag
studies. This observation is in agreement with our previous reports
indicating that medulloblastoma cells, grown under standard
serum-containing culture conditions, lose Shh pathway activity
(9, 10). In the case of glioblastoma, Lee et al. (45) recently reported
that cultured tumor cells in serum-containing media are very
different, both genetically and biologically, from the parental
tumors. These studies question the usefulness of cultured tumor
cells for testing antitumor agents. We propose that directly
transplanted tumors, derived from genetically engineered mouse
models, offer a convenient system for target validation as well as a
convenient model system for testing new therapies targeted against
the molecular pathways that contribute to tumor formation and
progression.
