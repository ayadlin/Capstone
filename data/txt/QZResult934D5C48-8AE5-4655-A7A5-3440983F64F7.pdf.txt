The Role of Cell Density and Intratumoral Heterogeneity in
Multidrug Resistance
Orit Lavi1, James M. Greene2, Doron Levy2, and Michael M. Gottesman1

Abstract
Recent data have demonstrated that cancer drug resistance reﬂects complex biologic factors, including tumor
heterogeneity, varying growth, differentiation, apoptosis pathways, and cell density. As a result, there is a need
to ﬁnd new ways to incorporate these complexities in the mathematical modeling of multidrug resistance. Here,
we derive a novel structured population model that describes the behavior of cancer cells under selection with
cytotoxic drugs. Our model is designed to estimate intratumoral heterogeneity as a function of the resistance level
and time. This updated model of the multidrug resistance problem integrates both genetic and epigenetic
changes, density dependence, and intratumoral heterogeneity. Our results suggest that treatment acts as a
selection process, whereas genetic/epigenetic alteration rates act as a diffusion process. Application of our model
to cancer treatment suggests that reducing alteration rates as a ﬁrst step in treatment causes a reduction in tumor
heterogeneity and may improve targeted therapy. The new insight provided by this model could help to
dramatically change the ability of clinical oncologists to design new treatment protocols and analyze the response
of patients to therapy. Cancer Res; 73(24); 7168–75. 2013 AACR.

Major Findings
We suggest that chemotherapeutic treatment acts as a
selection process in the effective drug concentrations
range, whereas genetic/epigenetic alterations act as a diffusion process that results in trait spread based on different
stress signals. Application of our model to cancer treatment
suggests that reducing the alteration rate as a ﬁrst step in
treatment causes a reduction in tumor heterogeneity and
may improve targeted therapy.

Introduction
Resistance to chemotherapy remains a major cause of the
failure of cancer treatment. This resistance results from
numerous mechanisms. The "traditional" understanding of
multidrug resistance (MDR) and its driving mechanisms oversimpliﬁes the complexity of a perturbed cellular cancer network and focuses on several pathways/gene families. From

that perspective, drug resistance is associated instead with the
induction of drug efﬂux, activation of DNA repair, variations of
target proteins, decreased drug uptake, altered metabolisms,
sequestration, and changes in apoptotic pathways (1, 2).
Recently, intratumoral heterogeneity has also been found to
be a major facilitator of drug resistance. Intratumoral heterogeneity refers to differences between cancer cells originating
within the same tumor. Many primary human tumors have
been found to contain genetically distinct cellular subpopulations reported to be mainly the result of stochastic processes
and microenvironment signals (reviewed in ref. 3). In addition
to the genetic differences within a tumor, therapeutic resistance can also be caused by several other nongenetic processes,
such as epigenetic changes associated with chromatin modiﬁcation or DNA methylation (4–7). One study of these processes was done by Kreso and colleagues (8, 9), who found, in a
system with a single genetic clone, that there was functional
variability among the tumor cells. Clearly, the integration of
both genetic and nongenetic assumptions as well as heterogeneity should be included in the design of new experimental
and computational models to have a better description of and
ultimately, a solution to the problem of MDR.
To study intratumoral heterogeneity, we consider a mathematical modeling approach. As mentioned above, drug resistance is far from being a black-and-white, resistant or not
resistant phenomenon. Accordingly, a continuous variable is a
more appropriate way to describe, estimate and measure the
resistance level. This estimator is a key variable in any mathematical representation of the MDR system and without it a
comprehensive mathematical model cannot be developed.
Several direct and indirect approaches have been suggested
to estimate the drug resistance level, depending on the type of
data that is analyzed. For instance, in in vitro experiments, the

Modeling the Intratumoral Heterogeneity in Multidrug Resistance

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
A structured population model
Here, using a continuous deterministic population model, we aim to describe the problem of multidrug resistance (MDR) by
including key mechanisms that control the dynamics of the cancer-related system. Such a model should be viewed as a
simpliﬁcation of the full, complex system. We consider all variables and parameters (e.g., death, mutation rates, etc.) to be
functions of the resistance level (i.e., traits), in which a trait is assumed to be a continuous variable. On the basis of the approach of
Lorz and colleagues (16) of using a system of integrodifferential equations parameterized by the variable of the resistance level (x),
we provide a basis for structured population models designed to estimate the intratumoral heterogeneity as a function of the
resistance level (x 2 [0, 1]) and time (t), with density, r, dependence. The evolution over time of each subpopulation n(x, t) is based
on the rate of cell division, r(x), the natural rate of death, d(x), and the initial system conditions, n(x, 0). In addition, there are
contributions from all other subpopulations, depending on the genetic and epigenetic alteration function, M(x, y), that can be
thought of as a spread or diffusive effect. Of note, u(x) denotes the fraction of cells with trait x that can carry out new modiﬁcations,
where 0  ðxÞ  1. These alterations, M, can be either short term or long term in relation to the daughter cells. If a drug is
included, there is the additional rate of drug-induced death as a function of the dose, c(x, a), in which the drug is assumed to be
applied uniformly in time. Of note, f½rðtÞ and g½rðtÞ are included to add density dependence to the division and death rates, where
lim fðrÞ=gðrÞ ¼ 0þ . Mathematically, the system is modeled by equation A. All variables are listed and deﬁned in Supplementary

We demonstrate in detail how the model can qualitatively predict three common biologic observations based on density
limitation, but with different assumptions about the cell division, death, and alteration rates of cancer cells. In the ﬁrst case, we
study the cell density response as a function of the cell division and death rates, in which the drug-induced death rate could be
generalized as a function of the drug dose and the resistance level. We show how the relationship between these rates can create a
heterogeneous tumor over time, and illustrate how different treatments could decrease the variation in the heterogeneity by
selection, in the effective concentrations range. In the second case, we discuss the effects of genetic/epigenetic permanent
alterations that occur in different ﬁxed rates. In the third case, we present the contributions of additional temporal changes that
can evolve from speciﬁc environmental causes. For full details about the parameters and numerical results, see the Supplementary
Materials.

dose-response assay (e.g., the MTT assay) can quantify the
number of surviving cells after exposure to different drug
concentrations for a certain time period and can be presented
by "killing curves." The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values can be deﬁned as the drug concentrations required to
reduce cell viability to 50% of the untreated control population.
Thus, for example, the resistance level can be described here by
the IC50 value of each clone in the global population. A similar
trend in killing curves would be expected, to some extent, for
other drugs with similar features (targets, mechanisms, etc.). A
linear generalization of such an approach would be the number
of different drugs that can be separately applied to those cells
and yet the cells still survive, in which the level of resistance can
be calculated as a score of two variables: the number of drugs
and the IC50 value of each drug. A nonlinear generalization
would be the survival percentage of the treated population
with drug combinations administered at the same time point.
In all of these cases, the higher the score, the higher the
resistance level.
Unfortunately, most clinical data do not include the IC50
values and the in vitro conclusions have not led to success in
the clinic (10). Usually, clinical data include the physiologic
properties that describe the progress, extent, or severity of a

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor ("staging"). All assignments of cancer stage are made at
the time of diagnosis, before any treatment is given and thus
cannot directly assess the resistance level. Combining clinical
data with gene expression and survival data from the same
patients can help to categorize them as "good" or "poor"
responders, and a score for their resistance level can be
calculated. Accordingly, any theoretical model should include
subpopulations with resistance levels that can vary within the
interval between "good" and "poor" scores.
The number of cellular mutations has also been proposed
as a way to characterize resistance level. Because of the
stochastic nature of the mutation process, there are mutations that do not necessarily contribute to cancer progression,
and are not essential to the resistance level of a tumor. Yet
such mutations certainly increase the intratumoral heterogeneity. Of course, once the number of passenger mutations
accumulates to a certain level, they can be expected to have a
global effect on tumor growth and sensitivity to certain drugs
(11). The number of mutations does not necessarily go hand
in hand with the resistance level, but rather the type of
mutated pathways affects the evolution of MDR. For instance,
mutations in the apoptosis pathway cause a decrease in the
death rate (12), mutations in the RAS–RAF pathway cause

increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (13),
and mutator genes increase genetic alterations throughout
the genome. Moreover, there are certain genes that promote
genetic stability, including DNA repair genes, DNA damage
sensor genes, and cell-cycle checkpoint genes. Changes in
these stability genes affect the mutation rate and therefore
this rate is not necessarily a constant parameter over time
and space (14).
Many mathematical models related to MDR have been
developed (reviewed in ref. 15). Most of these models quantify
the resistance level as proportional to the number of mutations. Some models quantify the resistance level by considering
the expression of a single gene. Our work can be viewed mainly
as an extension of the mathematical model of Lorz and
colleagues, who developed a physiologically structured population model that is structured according to a continuous
variable that can represent the level of a phenotypic trait that
has been selected as relevant to describe population heterogeneity (16). Lorz and colleagues assumed that the cell division
rate is dependent on the cell density of normal cells, whereas
cancer cells are assumed to grow exponentially with a low
mutation rate. Inspired by their model, we propose an extended mathematical model for cancer cells with cell density

Results
Heterogeneity arising from treatment
The ﬁrst case we study is a hypothetical scenario in which
the system cannot have genetic or epigenetic changes, and its
dynamic is solely driven by cell division and death rates (Fig.
1A). Because the mass of the tumor is limited by the density
functions [Supplementary Materials, Eq. 7, mathematical proof
can be found elsewhere (J. Greene, O. Lavi, M.M. Gottesman,
and D. Levy, submitted)], the model predicts a stable distribution of cells with different traits after a ﬁnite time without
any treatment (Fig. 1B, C0 lines for IC1 and IC2). The administration of chemotherapy to such a system leads to changes in
the original distribution and a selection process that depends
on the drug-induced death rate, cðx; aÞ. This rate of death is a
function of the drug dose, a, and the resistance level, x.

dependence on cell division and death rates, and account for
both genetic and epigenetic changes. Moreover, we describe
the drug-induced death rate as a function of the dose and the
trait. This work is important for optimizing the efﬁcacy of
treatment. It has obvious implications for understanding the
complexity of cancer growth dynamics and for the analysis of
drug resistance data.

Modeling the Intratumoral Heterogeneity in Multidrug Resistance

Drug-induced death rate based on a ﬁxed dose. If the
dose is administered at a ﬁxed value a, then cðx; aÞ can be
replaced by cðxÞ. The drug-induced death rates of two
qualitative examples of different drugs are plotted in Fig.
1A as CDrug1 and CDrug2. The spikes in Fig. 1B labeled as
CDrug1 and CDrug2 show tumor homogeneity, because most
cells have similar traits. The CDrug1 curve has a spike at a
higher resistance level (i.e., x value). Figure 1A shows that
higher x values correspond to lower values of r(x), i.e., slower
cell division rates, an assumption made when the model was
developed. If only a few cells with different resistance levels
survive the treatment, that would be sufﬁcient to allow the
distribution of intratumoral heterogeneity to return to its
original stable proﬁle (Fig. 1B, C0: IC1 curve), because the cell
division and death rates have not changed. The time needed
to reach that control state varies based on the treatment and
its drug-induced death rate. Although if after the treatment,
several subpopulations located in the nonzero range of the
original stable proﬁle (Fig. 1B, C0: IC1 curve) die out, the
system would not restore this distribution (Fig. 1B, C0: IC2
curve). Kreso and colleagues provide evidence for a slowly
proliferating cell population in primary human colorectal
cancer cells that still retains potent tumor propagation
potential, thus preferentially driving tumor growth after
chemotherapy (8). A similar mechanism that reduces cell
proliferation and induces a dormant nondividing state was
reported by Lewis, in his review on MDR in microbiology
(17). Kreso and colleagues noted that although cancer cells
may have a uniform genetic lineage, individual tumor cells
are functionally heterogeneous, with a wide variety in terms
of growth dynamics and response to therapy. Dividing cells
are most likely to be eradicated ﬁrst, whereas the relatively
slower growing/dormant cells are the major population
during tumor reinitiation after chemotherapy. Of course, in
the study of Kreso and colleagues there could be nongenetic
alterations that could change one resistance level to another.
In our theoretical case, we show that even if the cells are
unable to mutate/change to another resistance level, it is
possible to have the same dynamic, if only a few slowly
proliferating cells that resist the drug remain. Once there is a
density limitation, the distribution of cells as a function of
the trait would be totally different from the control.
Drug-induced death rate as a function of the dose. Drugs
are usually categorized by their biochemical mechanisms of
action, targets, molecular structure, gene expression, and in
general by the cell response. However, from a mathematical
perspective, there is another dimension to drug efﬁcacy, which
is the effect of the drug on the shape of the survival curve. Given
two subpopulations, resistant and sensitive cells, the efﬁcacy
of a treatment could be estimated by the IC50 values, the slope
of the survival curves, and the distance between the two curves
of the two cell types (Fig. 2A and B). The slopes could be
compared at their IC50 values (i.e., at their maximum values).
The differences in treatment outcomes are not expressed solely
by the percentage of cells that survive, but also by the effect on
the remaining cells as a function of the dose and the resistance
level. A better treatment would result in a lower number of
surviving cells and a more homogeneous population. This can

www.aacrjournals.org

be expressed as survival curves with low IC50 values (solid vs.
dashed lines, Fig. 2A), with steeper slopes (slope1 vs. slope2, Fig.
2B), and a smaller distance between the two curves (D1 vs.
D2, Fig. 2A) with different levels of resistance. These three
factors inﬂuence the drug efﬁcacy.
Data from survival curves, drug sensitivity assays, and
apoptosis assays can be used to estimate the drug-induced
death rate in at least two ways when incorporating the features
that were mentioned above. Here, we describe two different
functions [c1 ðx; aÞ and c2 ðx; aÞ] to accommodate the two
different biologic datasets that indirectly measure the druginduced death rate as a function of the dose (a) or the trait (x).
Each dataset supplies different pieces of information that are
needed to estimate the death rate. Thus, different assumptions
should be made when using each type of dataset. The ﬁrst type
involves data that measure the percentage of apoptotic cells
for a range of resistance levels. Usually, these kinds of data
are based on different staining of a tumor from a patient
treated with a speciﬁc dose. Thus, the data include information on the death rate as a function of the trait, and can
be used to infer the dependence of function cðx; aÞ on the
dose. The second type of dataset is mainly from in vitro
experiments. These types of data measure the survival
curves for a range of drug concentrations for a few cell
populations. The data include information on the death rate
as a function of the dose, and can be used to infer the
dependence of function cðx; aÞ on the trait. In general,
both functions c1 ðx; aÞ and c2 ðx; aÞ would be expected to
be nonincreasing functions of the dose, for a given resistance
level. For high doses, the rate is at its maximum value,
whereas for low doses, the rate is at its minimum value.
Thus, there is a range of effective doses that this function of
the death rate can meaningfully model and a sigmoid
function is a very natural function to use in this case. The
second variable of the death rate is the trait (i.e., resistance
level). For a given dose in the effective range, the rate would
be expected to decrease as a function of the trait. Theoretically, with these two types of data and the drug efﬁcacy
factors, the drug-induced death rate is illustrated in Fig. 2C
and D. Figure 2C demonstrates the case in which this rate
can be written as a product of the death rate for a typical
dose and with the dose response as a decreasing sigmoid.
The function in Fig. 2D, in contrast, demonstrates a case
where the survival curves are used to describe the function
cðx; aÞ as a complex, nonseparable dependence. All functions are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Using our model, we estimated the cell density as a
function of the dose and duration of a treatment (Fig. 2E
and F). Our results show, in general, the desired sigmoid
response to a drug as a function of the dose and describe two
factors that are important to the efﬁcacy of a treatment, the
effective-concentration range and the critical-drug concentration (a ). The effective-concentration range is the range
of drug concentrations in which the cell density is decreased.
It is preferable to have as wide a range as possible. The
critical-drug concentration is the value at which the cell
density reaches a threshold for the ﬁrst time (e.g., minimum
tumor size that is detectable by the scanning instrument).

Figure 2. Death rate as a function of dose and resistance level. A and B, two common types of treatment (dashed and solid curves) for cells with different
resistance levels (red curves for sensitive cells and blue for resistant cells). The cells may react differently to certain drugs. For example, a very toxic drug
produces a lower IC50 value (solid vs. dashed lines), with a smaller distance between the two curves representing these cells (D1 vs. D2). Also, the slope can
demonstrate the response to a treatment, in which the steeper slope is the desired one (slope1 vs. slope2). C and D, two examples of death rates

Clearly, a low threshold is preferred. Furthermore, for each
death rate (C1 or C2), we compared the cell density for two
different drugs (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1C). A more
efﬁcient treatment has a wider effective-concentration
range, a lower critical-drug concentration, and a steeper
cell-density slope, as occurs with drug 1 in both cases
(Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1D).
In addition, during treatment the cell density is shown to
be a more complex curve than a simple sigmoid curve. The
success of a treatment is related to the shape of the corresponding density curve. For an example, see the density
curves based on treatment of drug 1 versus drug 2 in both

Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1D. The density response is a
nonlinear function of the cell division rate, drug-induced
death rate, and the density limitation in the effective concentrations range. For many drugs, the cell division rate also
changes as a function of the dose, with higher doses
usually leading to lower division rates. In practice, most
drugs that cause a decrease in cell division rate also cause a
decrease in the death rate. The strategy of combining
multiple drugs, in which the ﬁrst drug causes an increase
in the death rate and the second drug causes a decrease in
the cell division rate, may result in a better response, at
lower drug concentrations.

Modeling the Intratumoral Heterogeneity in Multidrug Resistance

Heterogeneity arising from both epigenetic and genetic
changes
Spontaneous genetic mutations occur infrequently, but
some cancer cells have increased rates of genetic change for
various reasons. For example, in breast cancer, mutation of a
single gene, Brca2, can lead to increased rates of mutations in
other genes (18). The tumor microenvironment can also cause
genetic changes. As tumors are exposed to repeated cycles of
hypoxia and reoxygenation, DNA repair pathways are downregulated, thus leading to genetic instability (19, 20). Some of
the mechanisms that lead to stable genetic changes are due to
epigenetic alterations. Genome-scale genomic and epigenomic
analyses have only recently revealed the complexity of the
nonlinear relationship between these two types of changes and
cancer. Although genetic mutations alter the sequence of DNA,
epigenetic changes do not (reviewed in refs. 21, 22). Yet
epigenetic changes can be inherited by causing mutations and
silencing important genes by methylation (e.g., MGMT,
CDKN2B, and RASSF1A), with a greater rate of epimutations
than the rate of spontaneous genetic mutations (21). On the
other hand, not all epigenetic changes are inherited, so they
may lead to relatively rapid phenotype switching. In addition,
these two types of changes can evolve from different causes.
Genetic mutations can occur as a result of random processes or
may be induced by stress (e.g., hypoxia, nutrient starvation,
toxic molecules etc.), whereas epigenetic alterations are mainly
linked to stress. It has also been shown that a central epigenetic
control circuit can be disrupted by a genetic mutation (22).
Clearly, the complexity of genetic and epigenetic networks has
not yet been fully characterized, though it is clear that the
outcome largely depends on external stresses. Thus, in the
following cases we assume an indirect relationship between
both networks that is based on an external stress.

Stable changes. The second case considers the possibility
of having epigenetic and/or genetic stable alterations when
cells undergo division. Of note, M(y, x) denotes the probability
that, given an alteration, a mother cell with trait y will yield a
daughter cell with trait x. We considered M(y, x) to be a
Gaussian distribution conﬁned to (0, 1) with mean y and

variance "2 2. The variance is one of the most important
factors that must be considered because it reﬂects the impact
of an alteration on the global system. Hence, the changes in
variance can be written as a function of the external stress and
time, "ðstress; tÞ. As time progresses, different traits become
advantageous or disadvantageous, and the overall dynamics
are determined by various rates, mutation parameters, and the
initial distribution of the cells. Figure 3 summarizes several
examples of three variances 0 ¼ "0 < "2 < "1 before (Fig. 3A)
and after (Fig. 3B and C) treatment in a given effective dose.
From these examples, it is obvious that different assumptions
cause a divergence in predictions related to heterogeneity,
even when using a single model. The general trend in these
results indicates that mutations/epimutations (even at low
rates) can serve as a diffusion process, over x, because the cells
with a given trait may spread to an interval of x values that
initially was set to zero. As expected, cases with high variation
have high stable heterogeneity, whereas small variation slightly
changes their dynamic from the nonaltered case. All other
values and sequences of e are constrained in that range, and
affect the time to reach the control state ð"0 ¼ 0Þ.
Temporal changes. In the third case, the additional contribution of the M function is only valid for a speciﬁc period of
time, when certain signals stress the tumor. We studied two
possible mathematical modiﬁcations to system A. The ﬁrst
system assumes an accumulation of changes that occur with
different time scales. Thus, we separate the alteration function

into two functions. The ﬁrst type of changes is related to
hereditary alterations, and it is therefore applied for all time
points, and the second type is applied only to a limited period of
time because it is based on temporal epigenetic variations
(marked as M1 and M2, respectively). As mentioned above,
there is an indirect assumption of interaction between the M
functions, which is qualitatively expressed by the activity
timing of M2 and the e of both functions. We studied the effect
of e, and its variation in each M function, on the dynamic with
drug for a given dose, c(x). Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S3
summarize several examples of different variances for both
functions after stress.
These results highlight the tradeoff between changing the
alteration rate and the drug selection process, which in turn
affects the heterogeneity of the cancer cell population. If the
alteration rate remains low during the entire process, the
treatment would be more efﬁcient, and the surviving cells
would constitute a more homogenous population (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Once this selection is achieved, it is
recommended that the second treatment should be more
speciﬁcally targeted to the surviving population. However, if
the ﬁrst treatment is known to increase the alteration rate, a
combination of drugs should be applied instead, in which
one of these drugs (such as a drug that affects pattern of
gene expression) aims to reduce this rate. On the other hand,
if the initial alteration rate is too high and there is no
effective treatment to reduce it, the model predicts
(see Fig. 1A and red curve in Supplementary Fig. S2C) that
increasing the alteration rate, at the time of treatment,
should also result in a better response to the selective drug.
In any event, at the end of the treatment, the rate of
alteration must be decreased as much as possible.
The second modiﬁcation to system A includes the temporal
epigenetic changes by varying the parameters u and e based on
the external stress ½ðstress; tÞ; "ðstress; tÞ, with a single M
function (Supplementary Materials, system; ref. 12). During
treatment, the results show that if u increases, with a constant
set of parameters, the density decreases but with a similar
Gaussian shape of distribution. The cell density becomes
signiﬁcantly low when the e reaches a certain level (Supplementary Table S4). A possible biologic interpretation for the
parameter u is the percentage of proliferating cancer cells
based on stress.

Discussion
Enormous progress has been made in understanding the
molecular mechanisms leading to cancer, but our perspective
on resistance to treatment is still in its infancy. A systems
approach combines empirical, mathematical, and computational methods to gain an understanding of this complex
phenomenon. Recent data show that the diverse intratumoral
heterogeneity is mainly the result of stochastic processes and
microenvironment signals. Thus, it is important to quantify the
resistance levels in a nondiscrete manner. Resistance evolves
parallel to the progression of cancer. However, not all abnormal changes contribute to the resistance level. Hence, the next
experimental efforts should incorporate a characterization of
the intratumoral heterogeneity based on the resistance level

because this classiﬁcation plays key roles in the development of
MDR and in modeling such a system.
Here, we have presented a mathematical analysis of the
MDR problem with the assumption that resistance is induced
by adaptation to drug and/or environmental signals in a
deterministic manner. We have used physiologically structured equations in which a continuous variable represents the
resistance level. Such a variable may be generated by integrating a collection of physiologic measurements, as discussed in
the introduction. Using our model, one can explain how the
density plays an important part in the dynamic of a tumor.
Adding this density dependence results in different distribution/heterogeneity.
Many observations of heterogeneous tumors have been
reported (3), but not all of those tumors were sampled after
drug treatments (23). Therefore, the drug was not necessarily
the only component that affected the heterogeneity and the
alteration rate. This rate varies widely across mammalian
genomes (24), and this variation has important consequences
for our understanding of the global evolutionary process, and
in particular about cancer. We have sought to investigate such
cases by examining heterogeneity as it relates to resistance
level and time, in which the alteration rate varies over time with
or without chemotherapeutic treatment and external stress.
We assume that the alteration rate could be affected by either
the treatment or the external stress, but the induced death rate
varies only based on the treatment. Certainly, there is a
possibility of having a mutation in the apoptosis pathway and
therefore affecting the induced death rate, but there is no clear
way of expressing this rate as a function of the trait.
Our results suggest that treatment acts as a selection
process in the effective drug concentrations range, whereas
genetic/epigenetic changes act as a diffusion process based on
different stress signals. In a case with no changes and no
treatment, the dynamic is determined solely by the cell density,
cell division, and natural death rates as functions of the
resistance level. We further examined the effects of two types
of mathematical modiﬁcations. In this model, the resulting
dynamic and response are expressed by only three main
elements: density [rðtÞ], heterogeneity [nðx; tÞ], and alteration
rate (e).
Thus, the design of a new treatment protocol should also
incorporate the individual status about these variables that
should be estimated at the time of diagnosis. The common
approach for selecting a protocol is to ﬁnd and target genes
that are signiﬁcantly expressed in most cells in that tumor.
Successful treatment is determined by the substantial reduction in the tumor size. The next obvious questions would be the
following: What will happen with the remaining cells? Will
these cells evolve into a more aggressive and resistant tumor or
not? If these cells are low in number, how can we identify them?
The model predicts that it is recommended to develop/bioengineer a treatment that targets the alteration rate of all cells
to reduce this rate as much as possible before any other
treatment, so the heterogeneity will not increase over time.
In any event, it is predicted that it is better to ﬁrst treat the
small subset of cells with a high alteration rate than the bulk of
the tumor using a speciﬁcally targeted therapy but with a low

Modeling the Intratumoral Heterogeneity in Multidrug Resistance

alteration rate. If this rate is very high and cannot be affected by
external intervention, during treatment it is predicted that the
increase in the alteration rate increases the spread to other
traits that are not necessarily better in their survival; therefore,
the density decreases and the entire system results in a better
response. Increasing the alteration rate per se is an extreme
approach; therefore, there is a need to bioengineer such a
modiﬁcation in a temporary and reversible manner. Another
possibility is to increase the percentage of cells that could be
exposed to alterations. By the end of the treatment, there is a
need to reduce the alteration rate as much as possible.
Our ﬁndings imply that at certain levels of resistance, where
the division rate is higher than the death rate (including the
contribution of the alteration rate), this deterministic
approach can be applied. It is possible that when the difference
between those rates is low and there is additional stochastic
noise, the stochastic results will differ from the deterministic
prediction. Also, the study conducted in this article focused on
the role of cell density and intratumoral heterogeneity in drug
resistance. If several drugs are administered, a full study will be
required to consider the multidimensional analog in which
the resistance level is a vector in a space whose dimension is
the number of drugs being administered. A complete study of
this nature is beyond the scope of this article, as it will require
detailed information about the cross-reactivity between the
various drugs. An alternative approach would be to view the
level of drug resistance as the magnitude of such a vector of
resistance. In this case, changing the drug can be modeled by

shifting the values of the distributions with respect to the trait.
A full study addressing these two issues is left for future work.
