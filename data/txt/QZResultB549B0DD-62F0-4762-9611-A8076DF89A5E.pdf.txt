BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement may predict the outcome of targeted drug therapy and also are associated with the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). The authors of this report investigated the relation of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement status and the
expression of DNA repair or synthesis genes, including excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1), thymidylate synthetase (TS), and breast cancer-early onset (BRCA1), as a potential explanation for these observations. METHODS: In total, 104 resected lung adenocarcinomas from women who were nonsmokers were analyzed concurrently for
EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, and mRNA expression of the ERCC1, RRM1, TS, and BRCA1 genes. EGFR mutations were
detected with a proprietary detection kit, ALK rearrangements were detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis, and genetic
mRNA expression was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Of 104 patients, 73 (70.2%) had EGFR
mutations, and 10 (9.6%) had ALK rearrangements. ERCC1 mRNA levels in patients who had EGFR mutations were 3.44  1.94  103,
which were significantly lower than the levels in patients who were positive for ALK rearrangements and in patients who were
negative for both biomarkers (4.60  1.95  103 and 4.95  2.33  103, respectively; P ¼ .010). However, TS mRNA levels were
significantly lower in patients who had EGFR mutations (1.15  1.38  103 vs 2.69  3.97  103; P ¼ .006) or ALK rearrangements
(1.21  0.78  103 vs 2.69  3.97  103; P ¼ .020) than in patients who were negative for both biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: NSCLC
specimens that harbored activating EGFR mutations were more likely to express low ERCC1 and TS mRNA levels, whereas patients

INTRODUCTION
Despite ongoing efforts to reduce smoking, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with 1.4 million
deaths worldwide annually.1 Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of primary lung cancer
cases, and approximately 66% of patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at an advanced stage.1 Although several active anticancer agents are available, platinum-based chemotherapy, including third-generation agents like taxanes, gemcitabine,
vinorelbine, and pemetrexed, is still the standard first-line therapy for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease and
produces improved overall survival and life quality.2-4 However, the outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC remains
very poor (median survival, 8-12 months).2,3 Thus, more efficacious and less toxic strategies for patients with NSCLC are
urgently needed.
With the recent advances in pharmacogenomics research, it is possible to tailor chemotherapy for patients with
advanced NSCLC to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity according to the expression levels of 1 or several genes.5-8 With
the objective of improving the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy, a phase 3 trial was conducted based on chemotherapy tailored to excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) mRNA expression levels in patients with
advanced NSCLC.5 Patients in the control arm received docetaxel plus cisplatin, patients with low ERCC1 levels received
docetaxel and cisplatin, and patients with high levels of ERCC1 received gemcitabine and docetaxel. The results indicated

that the primary endpoint, the objective response rate,
improved statistically in the genotypic arm compared
with the control arm. Simon et al6 also observed that therapeutic decision making based on ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) and ERCC1 gene expression
levels in patients with advanced NSCLC is feasible and
has promise for producing improved patients outcome.
Likewise, together with other authors, we9,10 previously
described a strong association between both the RRM1
gene and the breast cancer-early onset (BRCA1) gene and
the therapeutic benefit derived from gemcitabine, platinum, and taxane. Both genes are critical components in
the DNA synthesis and DNA damage repair pathways.7,8
Along with the DNA repair genes, it has been
reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations can predict the efficacy of EGFR-tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), and such mutations were enriched in
Asian women with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who were
never-smokers. Recently, several phase 3 studies11-15 compared first-line EGFR-TKIs, such as gefitinib and erlotinib,
with doublet platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC who harbored
activating EGFR mutations, and the results indicated that
EGFR-TKIs produced significantly higher response rates
and longer progression-free survival (PFS) than traditional
chemotherapy in this selected population. Consequently,
2011 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines16 recommend EGFR-TKIs as the first-line choice for
patients with advanced NSCLC who have activating
EGFR mutations. Also in patients with EGFR mutations,
several studies have indicated that chemotherapy may result
in higher response rates,11 longer PFS,15,17 or longer overall
survival.12,15 Echinoderm microtubule associated protein
line 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion is
another important finding in the development of lung cancer that can inhibit apoptosis and the promotion of cellular
proliferation through the activation of the downstream
phosphoinositide-3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral
oncogene homolog 1 (PI3K/Akt) and microtubule-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.18 Similar
to EGFR mutations, previous results from limited samples
indicated that the frequency of EML4-ALK fusion was
increased in individuals with adenocarcinomas, in young
adult patients, and in individuals who never smoked or
who were light smokers.18 Recently, based on the excellent
efficacy of crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, in the treatment of
patients with advanced NSCLC who had EML4-ALK
fusion,19,20 the US Food and Drug Administration has
approved its use in clinical practice. It is noteworthy that
several studies have reported that patients who harbored
Cancer

ALK translocations also gained more benefit from treatment with pemetrexed.21,22
The clinical implications of these findings remain
unclear. We hypothesized an association between pharmacogenomics, such as DNA repair capacity and synthesis, and EGFR mutation status or ALK rearrangement
status as a possible explanation. The objective of this study
was to investigate the association of mRNA expression of
the ERCC1, RRM1, thymidylate synthetase (TS), and
breast cancer-early onset (BRCA1) genes with EGFR
mutation or ALK rearrangement status in 104 East Asian
women nonsmokers who had resected pulmonary adenocarcinomas from a single institution (Tongji University,
Shanghai, China).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimen Collection

Eligible patients were women with NSCLC who underwent surgery and had a histopathologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Tumor tissues were collected within half an
hour of resection and were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin and then stored as paraffin-embedded archival
until use. All tissues were reviewed by pathologists for
confirmation of tumor histology and tumor content. Paraffin sections were then cut at 10 lm thickness, and DNA
and RNA were isolated from 10 slides of the paraffin-embedded specimens. Patients were considered never-smokers in this study if they reported smoking <100 cigarettes
in their lifetime. Histology was based on criteria of the
World Health Organization, and the TNM classification
was determined according to version 7 the International
Association for the Study of Lung Cancer staging system.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University (Shanghai, China); and written informed consent was obtained
from each participant before the initiation of any studyrelated procedure.
Mutational Analyses

All mutational analyses were performed in Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute (Shanghai, China).
Genomic DNA or RNA was extracted from lung tumors
using standard protocols (RNeasy Mini Kit and QiAamp
DNA Mini Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). EGFR
(exons 18-22) was sequenced using genomic DNA. Cycle
sequencing of the purified polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) products was carried out with PCR primers using
the commercially available ADx Mutation Detection Kits
(Amoy Diagnostics Company Ltd., Xiamen, China). The

1 hour. b-Actin was used as the internal control. The PCR
conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at
95 C for 5 minutes was followed 95 C for 25 seconds,
64 C for 20 seconds, and 72 C for 20 seconds to ensure
the specificity; and 31 cycles at 93 C for 25 seconds,
60 C for 35 seconds, and 72 C for 20 seconds for
data collection and to determine sensitivity. Qualitative
judgments were based on the mutation fluorescence
signal.

RESULTS

Detection of ALK Rearrangements in Clinical
Specimens

Relative cDNA quantification for the ERCC1, RRM1,
TS, and BRCA1 genes was done using a fluorescent, realtime detection method (LightCycler 2.0; Roche Applied
Science, Penzberg, Germany) using an internal reference
gene (b-actin) as a control. The details of this process
were published previously in studies9,10 from our institute. Amplification was carried out in a total volume of
25 lL containing 0.25 lM of each primer, 0.02 mM
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, 1 mM Mgcl2, 1.25 U
Taq polymerase, and 5  PCR buffer. The PCR program
was initiated with a 1-minute denaturation step at 95 C.
The DNA was amplified by 1 cycle at 95 C for 5
seconds and 50 cycles at 92 C for 40 seconds, followed by
elongation of at 60 C for 40 seconds. All gene expression
analyses were performed in a blinded fashion in which
the laboratory investigators were unaware of the clinical
data.
Statistical Analysis

For statistical analyses, we used the SPSS statistical software package (version 13.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).
Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used to analyze
correlations between EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement status and clinicopathologic variables. The MannWhitney U test was used to determine significant
associations between continuous variables (ie, gene
expression) and dichotomous variables (ie, mutation
status). All statistical tests were conducted at a 2-sided
level of significance of P < .05.

Assembly of Tumor Samples

From July 2008 to May 2010, 135 resected specimens
from women with lung adenocarcinoma were collected
consecutively at the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital,
Tongji University, Shanghai, China. All patients (100%)
were ethnic Chinese (Han). Of these, 104 patients were
included in this study based on the following criteria: a
rereview confirmed a pathologic diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma, the tumor specimen contained a minimum of
30% tumor cells, enough tissue was available for comprehensive analysis, the patient was a never-smoker, and the
patient had not received any neoadjuvant treatment or
anticancer drugs. Detailed clinical characteristics are listed
in Table 1.
EGFR Mutation and ALK Rearrangement Status

Seventy-three of 104 tumors (70.2%; 95% confidence
interval, 61.4%-79%) harbored EGFR kinase domain
mutations. Among these, 28 mutations were deletions in
exon 19, 44 were leucine to arginine codon 858 (L858R)
missense changes, 8 were threonine to methionine codon
790 (T790M) mutations, and 7 tumors contained 2 different mutations, such as an exon 19 deletion together
with T790M mutation or an L858R with T790M mutation. The EGFR mutation status had no significant association with clinical characteristics in terms of age,
performance status, disease stage, or tumor differentiation
(see Table 2).
ALK rearrangement was observed in 9.6% of tumors
(10 of 104; 95% confidence interval, 3.95%-15.28%).

The median age was 54 years in patients with ALK rearrangement and <65.1 years in patients without ALK rearrangement. ALK rearrangement had no statistical
correlation with other clinical characteristics, such as performance status, disease stage, and tumor differentiation
(see Table 2). EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement
were mutually exclusive among the 104 patients.

patients with EGFR mutations was 3.44  1.94  103,
which was significantly lower than the level in patients

correlated significantly with different EGFR mutation or
ALK rearrangement status, although they were lower
numerically in patients who had EGFR mutations than in
the group that was negative for both biomarkers.
DISCUSSION
In this article, we report for the first time an association
between EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement status
and expression levels of mRNA in the ERCC1, RRM1, TS
and BRCA1 genes in 104 East Asian nonsmoking women
who had resected pulmonary adenocarcinomas. In this preselected population, 73 tumors (70.2%) were positive for
EGFR mutations, and 10 tumors (9.6%) were positive for
ALK rearrangements. We observed that NSCLC specimens
with EGFR mutations were more likely to express low
ERCC1 and TS mRNA levels, whereas specimens that
were positive for ALK rearrangements were more likely to
express low levels of TS mRNA.
Pulmonary adenocarcinoma among Asian women
who were nonsmokers was regarded first as a separate

study.23 In that preselected population, EGFR mutations
(ie, deletions in exon 19 and L858R point mutations in
exon 21) were enriched and were highly associated with
increased sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs.24 More recently, previous results from limited samples indicated that the frequency of EML4-ALK fusion was increased in patients
with adenocarcinoma, in young adult patients, and in
individuals who had never smoked or who were light
smokers.18 Sun et al25 observed that the EGFR mutation
rate was as high as 82.9% in pulmonary adenocarcinoma
samples from 41 Chinese women who were nonsmokers.
Furthermore, Wu et al26 reported that, in patients with
wild-type EGFR, the ALK rearrangement rate was 34% in
a Taiwanese population. Consistent with these results,
our findings suggest that the majority of lung adenocarcinomas from nonsmoking East Asian women can be
defined molecularly by targetable oncogenic mutant
kinases, mainly EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement.
With the successful introduction of personalized,
molecular-targeted agents like EGFR-TKIs and ALK
inhibitors into clinical practice for the treatment of
advanced NSCLC, more and more patients are identified
who harbor EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements
before the initiation of therapy. It is noteworthy that these
biomarkers reportedly not only were able to predict the efficacy of the targeted drugs but also appeared to be associated with the outcome of chemotherapy.11,12,15,17,21,22 In
the Iressa Pan-Asia Study,11 efficacy in the chemotherapy

arm was surprisingly good for the EGFR mutation subgroup; the overall response rate to chemotherapy in
patients who had tumors with EGFR mutations was
47.3% compared with 23.5% in patients who had wildtype EGFR. Moreover, Wu et al27 reported that EGFR
mutation-positive patients who received pemetrexed had
a better response rate and longer PFS than the patients
with wild-type EGFR. According to results reported by
Camidge et al21 and Lee et al,22 pemetrexed therapy is
associated with prolonged PFS in patients with NSCLC
who have ALK rearrangements.
Many preclinical and clinical studies5-10,28,29 have
demonstrated that DNA repair capacity and synthesis
genes can correlate with clinical outcome in patients with
NSCLC who receive chemotherapy. It has been postulated that impaired DNA repair capacity may be associated with increased genomic instability and increased
tumor mutation rates. In preclinical studies,30 EGFR and
DNA repair pathways have been linked, and these findings have implications for platinum-based therapy, possibly through BRCA1. Along this line, it has been
demonstrated that cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity depends
on EGFR-directed signaling, resulting in increased
platinum-DNA adducts in high EGFR-expressing cell
lines. Relatively little information31,32 exists on whether
EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines are more sensitive to
DNA-damaging chemotherapy or ionizing radiation in
preclinical models. Das et al31 indicated that EGFR

mutation enhanced sensitivity to radiation by a multifaceted process, including delayed DNA repair kinetics, suggesting that other components of the DNA repair
mechanism may be involved in this association. Lee et al33
detected ERCC1 expression by immunohistochemistry
and EGFR mutations in resected NSCLC specimens and
observed that EGFR mutation was associated significantly
with lower ERCC1 expression levels. Furthermore, Gandara et al34 investigated the correlation between EGFR
mutation status and ERCC1 gene expression in patients
with advanced NSCLC and reported that specimens harboring activating EGFR mutations were more likely to
express low levels of ERCC1 mRNA. Consistent with those
results, we observed that ERCC1 levels were significantly
lower in the EGFR-mutated group in our population of
women never-smokers with pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
However, no difference was observed between the ALK
rearrangement group and the negative group.
Pemetrexed is currently approved for the treatment
of patients with nonsquamous cell histology as first-line
treatment in combination with platinum,4 both as a second-line single agent35 and as maintenance therapy36 after
first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy. Additional studies28,29 indicated that high TS expression is considered a
resistance mechanism in NSCLC and may be a predictive
biomarker of pemetrexed sensitivity. Furthermore, Lee et
al22 observed that TS mRNA levels were relatively low in
ALK positive cells. Consistent with this result, in our current study, we also observed that patients with NSCLC
who had ALK rearrangements were more likely to express
low TS mRNA levels. In addition, patients with NSCLC
who had EGFR mutations also were more likely to express
low TS mRNA levels, which, to some extent, may explain
the finding that EGFR mutation status also was a predictor of pemetrexed efficacy.27
In our current study, no association was observed
between EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement status
and the RRM1 and BRCA1 genes expression. Regarding
these genes, few studies have investigated their relation to
EGFR mutation or ALK fusion status. In an invivo study,
Li et al30 demonstrated a novel link between EGFR inhibitor and homology-directed recombinational repair and
observed that BRCA1 status may affect the sensitivity of
cancer cells to erlotinib in human breast cancer cells. In
lung cancer, Rosell et al37 investigated the predictive role
of BRCA1 in the response to erlotinib for patients with
EGFR mutations and observed that low BRCA1 levels
were associated with longer PFS in response to erlotinib
(P ¼ .02). However, in our study, we did not observe a
significant correlation between EGFR mutation and
Cancer

BRCA1 gene expression. Because BRCA1 plays an important role in the repair of erlotinib-induced DNA damage,
mainly through the homologous recombination pathway,37 we hypothesize that the mechanism of BRCA1’s
predictive role regarding the efficacy of erlotinib may be
based on DNA repair ability and not on the association of
its expression with EGFR mutation status, which may
partly explain these discordant results.
In conclusion, we observed that mRNA expression
levels of the ERCC1 and TS genes were associated with
EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement status. NSCLC
specimens that harbor activating EGFR mutations are
more likely to express low ERCC1 and TS mRNA levels,
whereas tumors from patients who have NSCLC with
ALK rearrangement are more likely to express low TS
mRNA levels. Our findings support the hypothesis that
EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements affect the efficacy of chemotherapy through the pathways of DNA
repair and synthesis genes. Because EGFR mutation and
ALK rearrangement status will be established as a matter
of routine before the initiation of any anticancer therapy
in clinical practice, these 2 biomarkers also may be helpful
in choosing the proper chemotherapy regimen for patients
with NSCLC.
