ABSTRACT
Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the glomerulus contributed
by mesangial cells is the hallmark of diabetic nephropathy, eventually leading to
glomerulosclerosis. In this study, we examined the regulatory signals involved in the
high glucose (HG)-induced overproduction of ECM in rat mesangial cells (RMCs). We
disclosed excessive fibronectin and collagen IV production, tyrosine phosphorylation of
signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3), and up-regulation
of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) expression in HG-treated RMCs. STAT1/
STAT3 binding element was essential for SOCS-3 promoter activity stimulated by HG.
HG was capable of promoting the specific DNA binding activities to an oligonucleotide
probe containing the SOCS-3 sequence. The selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and dominant negative p85 vector (DNΔp85) transfection
effectively abolished these HG-induced responses. Moreover, HG markedly increased
the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 protein expression, which could be inhibited by
LY294002 or transfection of DNΔp85. Taken together, these results suggest that HGinduced SOCS-3 upregulation depends upon the presence of STAT-binding element in
the SOCS-3 promoter, which is specifically activated by STAT1/3. The PI3K/STAT1/3
signaling pathway mediated HG-triggered ECM accumulation and SOCS-3 upregulation

transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) or more
distinctive molecules recruited. In diabetes, the molecular
basis of ECM accumulation is still an enigma, although
new gene expression, protein synthesis, and matrix
deposition have been linked to pathologic changes in
glomerular mesangial cells [2, 5, 6]. High glucose (HG)
has been shown to trigger the reactive oxygen speciesregulated NF-κB activation and cyclooxygenase-2
expression and mesangial cell proliferation through a
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway in

INTRODUCTION
Excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix
(ECM) in the glomerulus is the hallmark of diabetic
glomerulopathy and a key mechanism in the progression
of glomerulosclerosis [1, 2]. Multiple intracellular
regulators are thought to be involved in pathophysiology
of ECM. One of the mechanisms for hyperglycemiainduced mesangial cell cycle arrest [3] and ECM
accumulation [4] may be through the activation of signal

early stage of HG exposure to mouse mesangial cells [7].
Similarly, it has been found that late-onset, stable changes
in mesangial cell hypertrophy induction requires the
activation of ERK, JNK/SAPK, and PI3K pathways [8].
However, the affection in gene regulation, which occurs
during biological responses for diabetic glomerular ECM
deposition, is still unclear. Moreover, the role of PI3K in
the diabetic glomerular ECM accumulation has not been
completely established.
SOCS-3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-3) is an
intracellular protein, refers to cytokine-inducible SH2containing protein-3 (CIS-3), and belongs to the SOCS
family of proteins. SOCS-3 is selectively and rapidly
induced by appropriate cytokines and modulates responses
of immune cells to cytokines by interfering with the Janus
kinase (Jak)/STAT pathway [9, 10]. SOCS-3 expression
is transiently induced by a wide variety of inflammatory
and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon
(IFN)-γ, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-10 [11-15]. The specific
antisense oligonucleotides inhibited mesangial SOCS-3
expression have been demonstrated to lead to an increase
in the immune complex-induced STAT activation, and
implicating that SOCS may be an important modulator
of cell activation during renal inflammation [16].
Overexpression of SOCS-1 in human mesangial cells
has also been found to inhibit HG-induced JAK2/STAT
activation and increase TGF-β1 and fibronectin synthesis
[17]. Ortiz-Muñoz et al. have suggested that a JAK/
STAT/SOCS axis contributes to hyperglycemia-induced
cell responses in the kidney [18]. The pathological role
of mesangial cells in diabetes-induced nephropathy is
well known, but poorly understands the alteration in the
transcriptional gene regulation in mesangial cells under
diabetic condition. In this study, we tried to elucidate
whether SOCS-3 expression in mesangial cells can be
induced by hyperglycemia condition, and to investigate
the relationship among PI3K, STAT1/3, and SOCS-3
signaling in mesangial cells under HG condition, and to
clarify the role of these signals in HG-induced mesangial
ECM formation.

1C). Unlike HG, the addition of high mannitol (HM)
to the media did not affect the expression of collagen
IV in mesangial cells as compared with the control
(Figure 1C). LY294002 and DNΔp85 transfection could
effectively abolish HG-induced fibronectin and collagen
IV protein expressions (Figure 1B and 1C). Furthermore,
mesangial cells stimulated with HG triggered a rapid
and transient activation of PI3K, reaching maximal
level at 10 min and declining thereafter to background
levels within 30 min (Figure 2). LY294002 significantly
inhibited HG-increased PI3K activity. These results
confirmed that PI3K activation and subsequent ECM
accumulation forms the basis of a potential intracellular
signaling response to HG in primary RMCs.

HG-induced SOCS-3 expression and promoter
binding activity requires PI3K
We next assessed the activation of SOCS-3 through
the PI3K pathway during HG-induced ECM accumulation.
HG markedly increased the protein expression of SOCS3 in RMCs at 66-72 h after HG treatment (Figure 3A).
DNΔp85 transfection could abolish HG-induced SOCS-3
protein expression (Figure 3A–3b).
To identify the region(s) responsive to HG in the
SOCS-3 gene, we carried out a functional analysis of the
SOCS-3 promoter binding activity. Nucleotide sequence
of the full-length about 2.8-kb genomic 5’ region of rat
SOCS-3 was shown in Figure 3B. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assay (EMSA) showed a specific binding of nuclear
extracts from HG-treated RMCs to a ds oligonucleotide
probe spanning nucleotides –72 to –46 (STAT oligo)
including the STAT1/STAT3 binding element from –69
to –61 (Figure 3B). Accordingly, the results of EMSA
revealed that a strong DNA-binding activity to the
oligonucleotide probe containing the SOCS-3 sequence
was activated in RMCs under HG treatment (Figure 4).
A time-response study indicated that HG effectively
activated DNA binding activity early at 60 h and gradually
increased at 64-68 h and then decreased at 70 h (Figure
4B). Moreover, pretreatment of cells with LY294002
or DNΔp85 transfection entirely abolished the HGincreased SOCS-3 promoter binding activity (Figure 4C).
Mutation of the SOCS-3 consensus sequence resulted
in the complete loss of DNA-binding activity (Figure
4D), suggesting that SOCS-3 induction by HG relies on
a direct and specific binding of factor(s) to the SOCS-3
sequence. Addition of cold consensus oligonucleotide
(100-fold in excess) completely abolished the mobility
shift band, demonstrating the specificity of the protein/
DNA interaction. Moreover, pre-incubation of nuclear
extracts from HG-treated renal mesangial cells with
antibodies against STAT1 and STAT3, fully displaced the
DNA:protein complex (Figure 4D), indicating that the
translocation factor(s) binding to the SOCS-3 motif is
represented by STAT uniquely.

RESULTS
HG-induced ECM production of rat glomerular
mesangial cells requires PI3K
We first confirmed the role of PI3K signaling in the
expression of matrix components, such as collagen IV
and fibronectin, in primary rat mesangial cells (RMCs)
under HG (33 mM) treatment. The PI3K signaling was
disrupted by pharmacological selectively inhibitor
(LY294002) or dominant negative p85 (DNΔp85)
vector transfection. The treatment protocol for these
experiments in RMCs was showed in Figure 1A. HG
markedly triggered the protein expressions of fibronectin
and collagen IV in mesangial cells (Figure 1B and

immunocytochemistry. Western blotting analysis revealed
that HG induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1
(Tyr701) and STAT3 (Tyr705) in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 5A). LY294002 and dominant negative DNp85
vector transfection effectively prevented the effect of HG
on the STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation (Figure 5B and
5C). In fact, the STAT phosphorylation was declined at
60-66 h after the treatment of HG (Figure 5A), which was
consistent with the initial time for the induction of SOCS3 expression. Moreover, immunocytochemical analysis

SOCS-3 induction has been shown to be strictly
dependent on both STAT1 and STAT3 activation in
IFN-γ-stimulated J774 macrophage cells [19] (Figure
3A–3a), and on the STAT3 activation in G-CSFactivated granulocytes [20]. We next investigated
the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in HGtreated RMCs determined by Western blotting and

examined at the indicated time points. B. and C. PI3K was required for high glucose (HG)-induced rat mesangial cell ECM accumulation.
Mesangial cells were treated with serum-free DMEM containing normal glucose (5.5 mM) or HG (33 mM) for 24-48 h in the presence or
absence of specific PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) or dominant negative p85 vector (DNΔp85) transfection. Fibronectin (B) and collagen IV
(C) were analyzed by Western blotting. Results shown are representative of four independent experiments.

also showed that treatment with HG for 24-48 h markedly
increased the staining for phosphorylated STAT1 in
RMCs, which could be inhibited by LY294002 (Figure 6).
The expression of glomerular fibronectin, an ECM
protein, has been shown to be increased in diabetic
wild-type mice, but did not increase in diabetic p27Kip1knockout mice [21]. We next investigated the role of PI3K
and STAT1/3 in the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 protein
expression in HG-treated mesangial cells. Exposure of
RMCs with HG for 48 h markedly decreased the CDK2
protein expression and increased the p27Kip1 protein
expression, which could be dramatically inhibited by
both LY294002 treatment and DNΔp85 transfection
(Figure 7A and 7B). Transfection of both DNΔSTAT1 and
DNΔSTAT3 could also inhibit the increased p27Kip1 protein
expression in HG-treated mesangial cells (Supplementary
Figure 1).

cell size (hypertrophy); these events typically precede
and may be responsible for the accumulation of ECM
proteins that leads to a decrease in renal function [22].
Mesangial cell induced excessive depositions of ECM
in the kidney are indeed manifestations of diabetic
nephropathy. Previous studies have demonstrated that
PI3K is an important signaling mediator of mesangial cell
proliferation and hypertrophy in vitro [7, 8]. High glucose
has also been shown to transactivate PI3K, leading to cell
proliferation and ECM accumulation in mouse mesangial
cell line MES-13 [23]. However, the role of PI3K in
the diabetic glomerular ECM formation still needs to
be clarified. In the present study, we showed a number
of findings with respect to the molecular mechanism of
hyperglycemia-induced and PI3K-dependent regulation
of the STAT1/3 and SOCS-3 signals, which involved
in the cascade of sequential reactions to induce a large
amplification of the signal in ECM formation in primary
RMCs. Schematic representation of proposed intracellular
signaling leading to HG-induced ECM formation in
RMCs was shown in Figure 8. First, pathological levels
of glucose activated PI3K, resulting in a modulation
of STAT1/3 phosphorylation. Second, the signaling

of the HG-induced STAT1/3 activation by PI3K inhibitor

of STAT3 in ECM production [24]. Furthermore,
increasing evidence suggests that hyperglycemia may
promote tumor progression [25]. Blood glucose level in
colorectal cancer patients correlates significantly with
local tumor malignancy [26]. Lin CY et al. demonstrated
that high glucose-induced migration and invasion of CT26 rat colorectal cancer cells were obviously contributed
by STAT3-activated ECM remodeling enzyme MMP9

expression [27]. As dynamic remodeling of ECM plays
an important role in regulating cell behavior as well as
tumorigenesis, blood sugar regulation is a critical issue
of concern and deserves further investigation. Unlike
high glucose, the addition of high mannitol to the media
did not display the responses in RMCs, indicating that
the high glucose-triggered responses are not the result of
high osmolality within the media. HG caused the increase

in mRNA and protein expressions of mesangial matrix,
including fibronectin [4, 28] and α1(IV) collagen [29].
These responses for ECM formation in mesangial cells
could be triggered by angiotensin II [30], endothelin-1
[29, 31], and PDGF [32]. Inhibition of the Jak/STAT
signaling pathway has been demonstrated to prevent the
HG-induced increase in TGF-β and fibronectin synthesis

in mesangial cells [4]. In the present study, results showed
that DNΔp85 transfection or LY294002 entirely abrogated
HG-enhanced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and
fibronectin and α1(IV) collagen protein expression in
RMCs, indicating that PI3K activation is required for

expressions.

The SOCS family of cytokine-inducible proteins
constitutes a negative feedback loop of JAK/STAT
pathway [9, 10]. Accumulated evidence has shown that
SOCS proteins can potently block the Jak/STAT signaling
pathway in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory
diseases [16, 33, 34]. It has been shown that the

expressions of SOCS family genes, mainly SOCS-3,
are markedly increased in the kidneys of experimental
models of immune complex glomerulonephritis [16].

kidneys has been demonstrated to inhibit the renal STAT1
and STAT3 activities and proinflammatory and profibrotic
protein expressions [18]. In the present study, we further
found that both LY294002 treatment and DNΔp85
transfection effectively inhibited the HG-triggered SOCS3 DNA binding activity in primary RMCs. The STAT1/3
phosphorylation was increased at 24-48 h after the
treatment of HG. The HG-activated STAT1/3 activation
was declined at 60-66 h, which was consistent with the
initial time for the induction of SOCS-3 expression,
indicating a negative regulatory role of SOCS-3 in
STAT1/3 activation in HG-treated mesangial cells. SOCS3 induction by HG was achieved via phosphorylation of
STAT1/3, which in turn binds to the SOCS-3 element
through a PI3K-activated signaling pathway. Because we

focused on the HG-induced SOCS-3-regulated STAT1/3related signaling, the direct effect of SOCS-3 knockdown
on the ECM production was not demonstrated in the
current work. However, we highly suggest that PI3K
is involved in the SOCS-3-regulated STAT1/3-related
signaling pathway to regulate ECM formation in RMCs
under HG exposure, and further studies are warranted.
A previous study has shown that both hyperplasia
and hypertrophy participate to approximately same extent
in causing kidney enlargement in streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rats [37]. Cell cycle has been demonstrated to
be regulated in diabetic nephropathy [38]. Cyclin kinase
inhibitor p27Kip1, which was up-regulated in glomeruli
of diabetic animals and HG-treated mesangial cells, has
been suggested to be required for hyperglycemia-induced

glomerular or mesangial cell hypertrophy [3, 39]. Awazu
et al. have shown that mesangial expansion was milder and
glomerular hypertrophy did not develop and glomerular
ECM protein expression of fibronectin did not increase in
diabetic p27Kip1 knockout mice [21]. In the present study,
we found that HG markedly decreased CDK2 protein
expression and increased p27Kip1 protein expression in
RMCs, which could be inhibited by PI3K inhibitor or
dominant negative p85 vector transfection. These results
indicate that a PI3K signaling is involved in the HGregulated p27Kip1 expression in RMCs, and imply that the

induction of PI3K-regulated p27Kip1 pathway may contribute
to the accumulation of ECM during hyperglycemia;
nevertheless, the further studies are needed to clarify this
possibility of its therapeutic potential in the future.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PI3K
up-regulates SOCS-3 expression/DNA binding activity,
STAT1/3 activity, and ECM formation in primary RMCs
under HG exposure. SOCS-3 expression induced by HG is
achieved via STAT1/3 activation, and the induced SOCS-3
signaling subsequently down-regulates STAT1/3 activation
in mesangial cells.

PI3K/STAT signaling, SOCS-3 probably was regulated by HG-induced mesangial cell gene expression and also exerts a negative feedback
on its interrelated gene expression.

200 µl of a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol to
stop the reaction. The radiolabeled lipids were separated
by thin-layer chromatography and visualized by
phosphorimaging.

Cell isolation and culture
Renal mesangial cells were isolated from
collagenase-treated rat glomeruli as previously
described [4]. In brief, glomeruli were harvested from
male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 to 200 g) by filtration
with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl solution through a 200-, 150, 120-, and 50-µm nylon mesh. Those retained on the
sieve were collected and washed by centrifugation (4°C,
2000 g), and incubated with 250 units/ml collagenase
(type I) for 30 min at 37°C under constant and gentle
shaking. Mesangial cells were plated on plastic tissue
culture flasks in low glucose DMEM (pH 7.4) either
with normal glucose (NG, 5.5 mM) or with HG (33
mM) or mannitol (33 mM) concentrations. The culture
medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin,
and 25 μg/ml amphotericin (an antimycotic agent). Cells
were routinely passaged by trypsinization after they
reached 80 % confluency using 10 cm culture dishes and
incubating them at 37°C in a humidified chamber with a
5% CO2-95% air mixture. Cells were subcultured at 1:6
at 7-day intervals, and the medium was changed at 2-day
intervals. Cells at passages 1–6 were grown to 75–85%
confluence, washed once with serum-free DMEM, and
growth-arrested in serum-free DMEM in NG for 24 h
to synchronize the cell growth. In some experiments for
detection over 48 h, starvation medium was added 2%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) to maintenance for optimal cell
condition.

Immunoblotting
The cellular lysates were prepared and a 100 μg
sample of each lysate was subjected to electrophoresis on
10-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The samples were then
electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
After blocking, blots were incubated with anti-fibronectin
(Transduction Laboratories), anti-collagen α IV (Santa
Cruze Biotechnology), anti-STAT1, anti-STAT3, antiphospho-STAT1, and anti-phospho-STAT3 (New England
BioLabs) antibodies in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline
within 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h followed by two washes (15
min each) in PBST. The membranes were then incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 30 min. Enhanced chemiluminescence
reagents (Amersham) were employed to depict the protein
bands on membranes.

Cell transfection
RMCs (5 × 105) were seeded in complete medium,
and followed by serum starvation 16 h before transfection.
Transfection was performed using the lipofectin reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the recommendations of
the manufacturer. Cells were transfected with 2 µg of
plasmids containing the DN-p85 kindly provided by Dr.
Lin WW (Institute of Pharmacology, National Taiwan
University, Taipei, Taiwan) or pcDNA3 control vector.
The efficiency of transfection (about 80%) was determined
using an equal amount of a plasmid encoding the green
fluorescent protein under the cytomegalovirus promoter.
The percentage of fluorescent cells was determined 48 h
after transfection by flow cytometry and fluoromicroscope.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity assay
PI3K activity was determined as described
previously [7]. Briefly, RMCs cultured in 6-well dishes
were serum-deprived for 24 h, 2 x105 cells received
different treatments and were washed twice with ice
cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 mM
lysis buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2,
1 mM CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1mg/
ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM
orthovanadate). Cell extracts were incubated with 2 µg of
anti-p85 antibody overnight at 4°C. The immunocomplex
was precipitated with 50 µl of protein A-Sepharose for
1 h at 4°C and washed three times with lysis buffer,
twice with LiCl buffer (0.5 M LiCl, 100 mM Tris, pH
7.6), and twice with TNE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.6,
100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The immunocomplex
was preincubated with 10 µl of 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4),
containing 2 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) on ice for
10 min. Kinase reaction was performed by adding 40 µl
of reaction buffer (10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mM Hepes,
pH 7.4, 20 µM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2) at room temperature
for 15 min. Added 100 µl of 1 M HCl extracted with

Preparation of nuclear extracts
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described
previously [7]. Approximately 2×106 cells were harvested
in cold PBS, pH 7.4, and pelleted at 1200 rpm for 5 min.
The pellets were resuspended in 400 µl of cold buffer A
(10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF), and incubated for 10
min on ice. The samples were centrifuged for at 1000 rpm
for 2 min. The supernatants were discarded and the pellets
were resuspended in 100 µl of cold buffer C (20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF) and
incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 1400
rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were frozen at -80 °C.
Protein concentration was determined using a colorimetric
assay by a BCA Protein Assay Kit (PIERCE).

EMSA were performed as described previously
[40]. The nuclear extracts (5 µg) were incubated
with a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide
probe containing the STAT-binding element (SOCS3) located at -69/-61 nucleotides of the promoter of
the SOCS-3 gene. The following oligonucleotide
with the SOCS-3 consensus binding sequence was
used:
5-CAGTTCCAGGAATCGGGGGGGC-3’
or with the mutant form of this sequence
5’-CAGTTCCAGGTTTCGGGGGGGC-3’ for 15 min.
The consensus oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled
using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P] ATP in a
binding reaction buffer. For binding reaction, 2 ng of the
labeled oligonucleotide (approximately 20,000 cpm) and
2 μg of poly dIdC (Amersham) carrier were incubated
with 20 μg of nuclear protein in a binding buffer (10
mM HEPES, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 7%
glycerol, pH 7.6) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples
were loaded on 6 % polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel
and electrophoresed for 3 h at 180 V in 0.5 × TBE buffer
and visualized by autoradiography. For competition
experiments, a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled
oligonucleotides was added 15 min before incubation of
nuclear extracts with the end-labeled oligonucleotides.
Moreover, the supershift experiments were performed by
incubating extracts with 2 µg of anti-STAT1or anti-STAT3
antibodies (New England BioLabs) for 60 min at room
temperature before adding the labeled probe. The reaction
mixtures were then subjected to electrophoresis in a 6%
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and analyzed in
autoradiography.

Immunocytochemical staining
To detect the phosphorylation of STAT1 in situ and
nuclear translocation, 80% confluent RMCs were seeded
on the cover glass coated with 1 N for 15 min at 4°C. The
cells were exposed to tested materials for 60 min, and then
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The samples were reacted
with anti-phospho-STAT1 antibody (1: 1000 dilution
in PBS, New England BioLabs) for over nigh at 4°C
temperature. After three washes with PBS, bound primary
antibody was detected with a biotinylated anti-rabbit
antibody followed by peroxidase system. Peroxidase
reaction was performed by using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine
(Sigma) as a chromogenic substrate.
