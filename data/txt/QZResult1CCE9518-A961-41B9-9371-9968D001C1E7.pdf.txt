Abstract
Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3,
SLCO1B3) is normally expressed in hepatocytes. In this study,
we showed frequent overexpression of OATP1B3 in colorectal
adenocarcinomas. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
analysis of 17 colon tumors indicated tumoral overexpression
of OATP1B3 by f100-fold, compared with 20 normal colon
samples (P < 0.0001). Using immunohistochemistry on a tissue
microarray containing 93 evaluable colon tumor specimens,
we detected immunostaining of OATP1B3 in 75 colon
adenocarcinomas (81%) and no immunostaining in normal
samples. To determine the functional effects of OATP1B3
expression on drug-induced apoptosis, we used camptothecin
and oxaliplatin on a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines stably
overexpressing OATP1B3. The results indicated that OATP1B3
overexpression enhanced cell survival in RKO, HCT-8, and
HCT116p53+/+ cells that harbor wild-type p53 but not in Caco-2
and HCT116p53 / cells that lack p53, compared with the
respective empty vector controls (P < 0.01). The terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay confirmed that HCT116 p53+/+ cells overexpressing
OATP1B3 had significantly lower apoptotic levels compared
with empty vector control (P < 0.001). The overexpression of
OATP1B3 reduced the transcriptional activity of p53, with
subsequent reductions in transcript and protein levels of its
downstream transcription targets (P21WAF1 and PUMA).
Overexpression of a point mutation (G583E) variant of
OATP1B3 lacking transport activity did not confer an
antiapoptotic effect or affect p53 transcriptional activity,
suggesting that the antiapoptotic effect of OATP1B3 may be
associated with its transport activity. Taken together, our
results suggest that OATP1B3 overexpression in colorectal
cancer cells may provide a survival advantage by altering p53dependent pathways. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10315–23]

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a major public health
problem accounting for over 1 million cases of new cancer and
about half a million deaths worldwide annually (1, 2). The lifetime

risk of developing CRC is 1 in 17, affecting men and women alike,
with 90% of cases occurring after the age of 50 years (3). CRC is
thought to develop from the progressive accumulation of genetic
mutations, many of which affect the control of apoptosis (4–6).
Abnormalities in apoptosis mechanisms may promote the selection
of cells that are resistant to apoptosis and consequently have
increased rates of mutations (7).
Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3; gene
name, SLCO1B3) belongs to the organic anion transporting
polypeptide (OATP/SLCO) superfamily and is expressed on the
basolateral membrane of hepatocytes around the central veins (8).
When expressed in the normal liver, OATP1B3 acts as an uptake
transporter for a variety of endogenous compounds (e.g., bile acids,
cholecystokinin, conjugated steroids, and thyroid hormones) as
well as xenobiotic compounds (e.g., pravastatin and paclitaxel;
refs. 9–12). OATP1B3 has been shown to be overexpressed in
various human cancer tissues as well as in cancer cell lines derived
from colon, pancreas, gall bladder, lung, and breast cancers
(9, 13, 14). Recent studies have reported that certain members of
the OATP family are overexpressed in breast and brain tumors and
may play a role as regulators of cellular processes such as
proliferation and apoptosis (15–20). However, it is not known
whether tumoral expression of OATP1B3 has any pathobiological
significance. In this study, we investigated the expression of
OATP1B3 in established colorectal adenocarcinomas and its
functional effect on cancer cell survival after chemotherapy
treatment using in vitro CRC cell line models.

Materials and Methods
Cells, plasmids, and reagents. The human CRC lines Caco-2, HCA-7,
HCT-8, and RKO cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. The isogenic HCT116p53+/+ (p53-wild-type) and HCT116p53 /
(p53-null) were gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD; ref. 21). All cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. The expression
plasmid for OATP1B3 (wild-type) was prepared by inserting the open
reading frame of the OATP1B3 cDNA sequence (NM 019844) into the
pcDNA3.1-Zeo+ vector (Invitrogen). The expression plasmid for the
OATP1B3 G583E mutant was prepared using the QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: 583E.fw, GGTTATAAGAACACTAGA AGGAATTCTAGCTCCAATATATTTTG and 583E.rv,
CAAAATATATTGGAGCTAGAATTCCTT CTAGTGTTCTTATAACC. The
plasmids used for the reporter assay, pcDNA3-Fp53, PG13-luc (containing
13-tandem repeats of the p53 consensus DNA binding site), P21WAF1-luc,
and PUMA-Luc reporter plasmids have been described elsewhere (22). The
polyclonal antibody against the COOH-terminal peptide sequence of
OATP1B3 has been previously used and shown to be specific for OATP1B3

(12, 23). The antibodies against p53 (DO-1) and P21WAF1 (WA-1) were from
Abcam. The antibodies against caspase 3, PUMA, poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), and h-actin were from Cell Signaling. The antibody
against NOXA was from Imgenex. The antibody against p53 (BP53.12) was
obtained from Chemicon. The reagents for immunohistochemistry were
from Biogenex. Fluorescently labeled deoxycholic acid (FITC-DCA) was a
gift from Dr. Jesse Martinez (University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ) and
previously reported to induce signaling changes in a similar manner to
unlabeled deoxycholic acid (24).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting analyses on colon tumors. Total RNA was isolated from 20 normal colonic
mucosa samples and 17 primary colon tumors (7 samples were from
matched donors). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from a total RNA
amount of 1 Ag using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using an iCycler with
the iQ SYBR-green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the following gene-specific
primers reported previously (25, 26); OATP1B3.fw, 5¶-GTCCAGTCATTGGCTTTGCA-3¶; OATP1B3.rv, 5¶-CAACCCAACGAGAGTCCTTAGG-3¶;
OATP1B1.fw, 5¶-TGAACACCGTTGGAATTGC-3¶; OATP1B1.rv, 5¶-TCTCTATGAGATGTCACTGGAT-3¶; OATP1A2.fw, 5¶-AAGACCAACGCAGGATCCAT-3¶;
OATP1A2.rv, 5¶-GAGTTTCACCCATTCCACGTACA-3¶; h-actin.fw, 5¶GCATCCTCACCCTGAAGTAC-3¶; and h-actin.rv, 5¶-GATAGCACAGCCTGGATAGC-3¶. Reactions were performed in duplicate and mRNA copy
numbers were quantified using purified PCR products as calibration
samples. The results were normalized to 106 copies of h-actin mRNA.
The overexpression of OATP1B3 protein in colon tumors was confirmed
by immunoblotting using protein lysates prepared from normal and
cancerous colonic tissues from the same donors (n = 5 pairs). Tissue
homogenate containing 25 Ag of total protein was subjected to
immunoblotting and probed for OATP1B3 and h-actin. Immunoactive
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham
Pharmacia).
Immunohistochemistry. A tissue microarray contained 93 deidentified,
archival cases of colon adenocarcinomas of all American Joint Committee
on Cancer criteria stages and 12 normal colonic mucosa sections. An
avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase assay was performed after the antigen
retrieval procedure using citrate buffer, and a polyclonal antibody against
OATP1B3 (1:200 dilution) was used (23). The immune reaction was
visualized using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB), and nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. The specificity of immunoreactive signals was
verified by omitting either primary or secondary antibody as well as by
incubating with polyclonal OATP1B3 antiserum that has been neutralized
by preincubation with the antigenic peptide.
OATP1B3 expression was evaluated by an experienced pathologist (E.H.).
The intensity of immunostaining was assigned as negative (0), weakly
positive (1), moderately positive (2), or strongly positive (3). In normal
colonic mucosa, the staining for OATP1B3 was negative. We therefore
designated staining of intensity of z1 as ‘‘positive’’ staining for OATP1B3.
Similarly, the immunohistochemical staining for p53 was performed on
the same colorectal tumor microarray using a monoclonal p53 antibody
(BP53.12; 1:100 dilution). The accumulation of p53 protein was evaluated by
an experienced pathologist (E.M.B.). The staining for p53 was designated to
be positive if z10% of tumor cells exhibit p53 immunostaining (27). In
normal colonic mucosa, there was no accumulation of p53 protein.
Development of in vitro model cell lines overexpressing OATP1B3.
CRC cell lines Caco-2, HCT-8, RKO and isogenic HCT-116 cells with wildtype or null p53 status were used to generate stable cell line models
overexpressing OATP1B3 or the G583E variant of OATP1B3. Cells were
transfected with the pcDNA3-based mammalian expression plasmid
containing the open reading frame of OATP1B3 or the empty vector
(control) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with the
optimal concentrations of zeocin (800 Ag/mL or 520 Amol/L for HCT-8 and
Caco-2; 400 Ag/mL or 260 Amol/L for RKO and isogenic HCT-116) for 3 wk.
OATP1B3 protein expression levels in the resulting resistant clones were
examined by immunoblotting.

tumor cell survival after the incubation with chemotherapeutic drugs,

camptothecin (CPT) or oxaliplatin was examined using the 3-(4,5Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay or ATP-based
assay (Cell Titer Glo; Promega). Cells were plated at a density of 5,000 to
20,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and treated with CPT (10 Amol/L),
oxaliplatin (10 Amol/L), or vehicle (DMSO), and cell viability was assessed.
The relative cell viability in the drug-treated group was calculated
compared with the vehicle-treated group.
Apoptosis assay: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
nick-end labeling assay. HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably expressing OATP1B3 or
empty vector were seeded into 8-well chamber slides. Cells were treated
with CPT (10 Amol/L) or vehicle (DMSO) for 24 h and stained by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL; In situ
cell death detection kit; Roche Diagnostics). Twenty random fields at 200
magnification, >1,000 cells were examined and photographed using
fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptosis was calculated by
counting TUNEL-positive (red fluorescence) and healthy nonapoptotic cells.
Luciferase assay. To investigate whether the antiapoptotic effects of
OATP1B3 involve the suppression of exogenous or endogenous p53
transcriptional activity, luciferase activity assays were performed in
HCT-116p53 / and HCT-116p53+/+ cells using the PG13-luc, P21WAF1-luc,
or PUMA-luc reporter plasmid, as previously described (22). Briefly, PG13luc is a reporter plasmid that has a firefly luciferase under the control of 13
tandem repeats of the p53 response elements, and P21WAF1-luc and
PUMA-luc reporter plasmids contain a firefly luciferase under the P21WAF1
and PUMA gene promoter sequences with p53 response elements (28, 29).
HCT-116p53 / cells were transiently transfected with the expression
plasmids for OATP1B3, p53, or empty vector as well as PG13-luc or
P21WAF1-luc and pRL-TK using Fugene 6 (Roche Diagnostics). After 48 h,
luciferase activity normalized for renilla luciferase activity was obtained
using a Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega). In separate experiments, HCT116p53+/+ cells stably overexpressing OATP1B3 or empty vector were
transfected with the PG13-luc or PUMA-luc and pRL-TK. After 24 h, cells
were treated with CPT (10 Amol/L) or vehicle (DMSO) for 4 h and further
incubated in fresh medium for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured as
previously described.
Chemotherapy treatment and immunoblotting analyses. HCT116p53+/+ cells stably expressing OATP1B3 or empty vector were treated
with CPT (10 Amol/L), oxaliplatin (10 Amol/L), or vehicle (DMSO). After
incubation, cells were harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
and subjected to immunoblotting. After the incubation with respective
primary and secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia). h-actin was used
as a gel loading control.
Effects of the OATP1B3 G583E variant. A point mutation variant
(G583E) of OATP1B3 lacking transport activity was used to assess the
relationship between OATP1B3 transport activity and its antiapoptotic
effect. Luciferase activity assays were performed using the PG13-luc plasmid
after transient transfection of OATP1B3 (wild-type), OATP1B3 G583E
variant, or empty vector in HCT-116p53 / cells. HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably
overexpressing OATP1B3 (wild-type), OATP1B3 G583E variant, or empty
vector were developed and used to assess the cellular uptake of a
fluorescently labeled substrate (FITC-DCA) by measuring the green
fluorescent signal associated with cell lysates after incubation with FITCDCA (10 Amol/L, 10 min) and subsequent PBS washes. In addition,
HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably overexpressing OATP1B3 (wild-type), OATP1B3
G583E variant, or empty vector were treated with CPT (10 Amol/L, 24 h) to
measure cell survival and protein levels of p53 and its target genes,
P21WAF1 and NOXA.
Statistical analysis. The results were expressed as the mean with
SD. Statistical significance between groups was determined using the
Mann-Whitney test, the unpaired Student’s t test, or ANOVA. P values of
<0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

test. B, immunoblotting analysis for OATP1B3

pairs) showed OATP1B3 overexpression,
whereas normal colon tissue did not.
C, immunohistochemical staining for OATP1B3
using the avidin-biotin complex method. The
positive signal was visualized by DAB staining
(dark brown color ). Normal human liver was
used as a positive control to confirm the
specificity of polyclonal OATP1B3 antiserum
and showed membranous immunostaining for
OATP1B3. Colon tumor tissue showed intense
cytoplasmic OATP1B3 immunostaining,
whereas normal colon tissue showed no
detectable immunostaining.

RT-PCR analysis indicated that OATP1B3 mRNA is markedly
overexpressed (96-fold differences in the median values) in the
colorectal adenocarcinoma samples tested compared with normal
colonic mucosa (P < 0.0001 by Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 1A). In
seven cases, the tumoral and normal colon tissue samples analyzed
were from the same donors and OATP1B3 mRNA was up-regulated
in all seven tumors compared with the matched normal colonic
tissue samples (average fold differences in seven matching pairs
was 76, ranging from 3–176). The expression levels of closely
related members of the OATP family (namely OATP1B1 and
OATP1A2) in these samples were also measured using quantitative
RT-PCR. The results indicated minimal expression of OATP1B1 and
OATP1A2 mRNA in both tumor and normal colonic mucosa,
suggesting that marked overexpression is specific to OATP1B3, not
accompanied by other tested OATP family members (data not
shown). The results from OATP1B3 immunoblotting analysis
confirm that OATP1B3 protein is overexpressed in colon tumors

(n = 3 of 5) but not in the adjacent normal colonic tissues from the
same donor (Fig. 1B). OATP1B3 expression in colon tissue seems to
be tumor specific and not related to the characteristics of an
individual patient.
The OATP1B3 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Because of the known expression of OATP1B3 in
human hepatocytes (10), liver sections served as positive controls
and were used to confirm the specificity of OATP1B3 antiserum
by antigenic peptide blocking (Fig. 1C). In normal colon tissue,
OATP1B3 protein expression was not detectable, consistent
with its minimal mRNA expression in normal colon (Fig. 1C). In
contrast, colon tumor sections showed intense OATP1B3 staining
localized in tumor cells with a primarily cytoplasmic staining
pattern, which was different from the exclusive membrane
staining pattern in the liver (Fig. 1C).
We assessed the extent and frequency of OATP1B3 protein
expression in established colorectal adenocarcinomas using a

colon tumor tissue array containing 93 evaluable tumor and 12
normal colon tissue specimens. Normal colonic mucosa did not
show OATP1B3 staining (intensity, 0); however, tumor tissue
sections showed OATP1B3 staining primarily in the cytoplasm.
We therefore designated staining of intensity of z1 as ‘‘positive’’
staining for OATP1B3. The results indicate that f81% of colon
tumor sections evaluated (n = 75 of 93 specimens evaluated) were
positive for OATP1B3 staining (Table 1). OATP1B3 expression was
prevalent in all clinical stages with no statistically significant

association with tumor stage (Fisher’s exact test, P > 0.05). In
addition, there was no statistically significant association between
OATP1B3 immunostaining and any known clinicopathologic
factors (e.g., gender, age, tumor location, and tumor size; Fisher’s
exact test, P > 0.05).
OATP1B3 overexpression provides a survival advantage to
colon cancer cells. We assessed the expression of OATP1B3 in a
number of established CRC cell lines, RKO, HCT-8, HCA-7, and
Caco-2 cells. The quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that

Representative images and the results from quantitative analyses indicate that OATP1B3 overexpression is associated with a significantly decreased rate in
apoptosis (P < 0.001, unpaired t test). B, after treatment with CPT (10 Amol/L, 24 h), the cleavage/activation of caspase-3 and PARP was substantially less in
HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably overexpressing OATP1B3 compared with their empty vector controls.

OATP1B3 mRNA is expressed in all the cell lines tested except
Caco-2 cells. The OATP1B3 mRNA levels per 106 copies of h-actin
were as follows: 22707 (HCA-7), 1473 (RKO), 250 (HCT-8), and not
detectable (Caco-2). Considering a possibility that the functional
effect of OATP1B3 overexpression may be affected by cell line–
dependent alterations, we developed cell line models stably
overexpressing OATP1B3 or empty vector using Caco-2, RKO, and
HCT-8 and examined whether OATP1B3 expression alters cell
viability upon CPT (10 Amol/L, 24 hours) treatment. The results
indicated that OATP1B3 overexpression led to a significant cell
survival advantage after CPT treatment in RKO and HCT-8 cells but
not in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2A). Noting that the cellular p53 status
differs between RKO and HCT-8 (p53 wild-type) and Caco-2
(harboring a p53 mutation causing a premature stop codon; ref.
30), we examined whether cellular p53 status is an important factor
determining the effect of OATP1B3 on cancer cell survival
using isogenic HCT-116 cells with wild-type and null p53 status.
OATP1B3 overexpression enhanced cell survival upon CPT
(10 Amol/L, 24 hours) or oxaliplatin treatment (10 Amol/L,
72 hours) in HCT-116p53+/+ cells but not in HCT-116p53 / cells
sharing the same genetic background (Fig. 2B and C, top). These
findings indicate that p53-dependent pathways may be potentially
important for the OATP1B3 effect to enhance cell survival after
chemotherapy treatment.

To examine whether OATP1B3 confers a survival advantage
through apoptotic pathways, we measured the apoptosis outcome
in HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably overexpressing OATP1B3 using the
TUNEL assay after CPT treatment (10 Amol/L, 24 hours). A
representative image shown in Fig. 3A shows that HCT-116p53+/+
cells overexpressing OATP1B3 are protected against apoptosis
induced by CPT (10 Amol/L) compared with the empty vector
control cells. The quantitative analyses of apoptotic (TUNEL
positive) and healthy nonapoptotic cells indicated that stable
overexpression of OATP1B3 in HCT-116p53+/+ cells leads to a
significant decrease (by 2.7-fold) in apoptosis (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A).
Consistent with these results, the activation/cleavage of caspase-3
and PARP was substantially reduced in CPT-treated HCT-116p53+/+
cells overexpressing OATP1B3 compared with CPT-treated empty
vector controls (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 versus 4).
OATP1B3 overexpression interferes with p53 transcriptional
activity. Using p53-responsive reporter assays, we examined
whether OATP1B3 expression interferes with the transcriptional
activity of p53. We first examined the effect of OATP1B3 expression
on the transcriptional activity of exogenous p53 by transiently
transfecting the expression plasmids for p53 and OATP1B3 as well
as p53-responsive reporter plasmids (PG13-luc and P21WAF1-luc).
Relative luciferase activity after cotransfection of p53 and OATP1B3
in HCT-116p53 / cells was substantially lower than that after

Figure 4. Coexpression of OATP1B3 affects p53 transcriptional activity. A, the results from the p53-responsive PG13-luc and P21WAF1-luc reporter assays in
HCT-116p53 / cells show that OATP1B3 expression causes a decrease in the transcriptional activity of exogenous p53. B, the results from immunoblotting
analysis indicate that cotransfection of OATP1B3 with p53 results in decreases in the protein level of P21WAF1, a p53 downstream target in HCT-116p53 / and
HCT-116p53+/+ cells. C, the results from the p53-responsive PG13-luc or PUMA-luc reporter assay in HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably overexpressing OATP1B3 or empty
vector show that CPT treatment increased reporter activity in the empty vector controls but not in cells overexpressing OATP1B3. D, HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably
overexpressing OATP1B3 or the empty vector showed induction of p53 protein upon chemotherapy treatment. However, the levels of the p53 downstream targets,
P21WAF1 and PUMA, were substantially lower or undetectable in chemotherapy-treated OATP1B3 overexpressing cells compared with chemotherapy-treated empty
vector control cells (lanes 2 vs 4 for CPT treatment; lanes 6 vs 8 for oxaliplatin treatment). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001, different from the rest,

Figure 5. The OATP1B3 variant (G583E)
lacking the transport activity confers neither an
inhibitory effect on p53 transcriptional activity
nor a survival advantage after CPT treatment.
A, the results from the p53-responsive
PG13-luc reporter assays in HCT-116p53 /
cells show that the OATP1B3 G583E variant
does not affect the transcriptional activity of
p53 in contrast to OATP1B3 (wild-type). B, the
results from a cellular uptake assay using a
FITC-DCA (10 Amol/L) indicate that
HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably overexpressing
OATP1B3 (wild-type) show an increased
cellular uptake of FITC-DCA compared with the
cells stably overexpressing the OATP1B3
G583E variant or empty vector controls.
C, overexpression of the OATP1B3 G583E
variant does not confer a cell survival
advantage after CPT treatment to HCT-116p53+/+
cells, in contrast to OATP1B3 (wild-type).

transfection of p53 alone (Fig. 4A). To ascertain the inhibitory effect
of OATP1B3 on p53 transcriptional activity, we examined the
protein levels of p53 and its downstream targets using HCT116p53 / or HCT-116p53+/+ cells after transient expression of p53
and/or OATP1B3. The results indicate that cotransfection of
OATP1B3 and p53 results in a substantial decrease in the protein
levels of a p53 downstream target, P21WAF1, compared with
transfection of p53 alone (Fig. 4B).
In addition, we investigated the effect of OATP1B3 overexpression on the transcriptional activity of endogenous p53 by
comparing the effects of CPT treatment in HCT-116p53+/+ cells
stably overexpressing OATP1B3 or empty vector. The results
indicated that CPT treatment increased PG13-luc or PUMA-luc
reporter activity in the empty vector controls but not in cells
overexpressing OATP1B3 (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that
OATP1B3 expression causes a decrease in p53 transcriptional
activity. The inhibitory effect of OATP1B3 on endogenous p53
transcriptional activity was further verified by examining the
protein levels of p53 and its downstream targets, P21WAF1 and
PUMA. HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably overexpressing OATP1B3 or
the empty vector showed induction of p53 protein upon CPT
(10 Amol/L, 24 hours) or oxaliplatin (10 Amol/L, 72 hours)
treatment. However, the levels of the p53 downstream targets,
P21WAF1 and PUMA, were substantially lower or undetectable in
chemotherapy-treated OATP1B3-overexpressing cells compared
with chemotherapy-treated empty vector control cells (Fig. 4D,
lanes 2 versus 4 for CPT treatment and lanes 6 versus 8 for
oxaliplatin treatment). These results from the p53-responsive

reporter assays and immunoblotting analysis suggest that
OATP1B3 overexpression interferes with the transcriptional activity
of p53 and its downstream signaling.
Antiapoptotic effect of OATP1B3 seems to be associated with
its transporter function. To investigate a potential association
between the antiapoptotic effect of OATP1B3 and its transport
function, we used a point mutation (G583E) variant of OATP1B3
that lacks transport activity (31). In contrast to OATP1B3 (wildtype), the OATP1B3 variant (G583E) did not affect the p53
transcriptional activity after transient transfection with the PG13luc plasmid in HCT-116p53 / cells (Fig. 5A). The cellular uptake
of the fluorescently labeled bile acid (FITC-DCA; 10 Amol/L, 10
min) was substantially lower in HCT-116p53+/+ cells stably
overexpressing the OATP1B3 variant (G583E) or empty vector
than in cells overexpressing OATP1B3 (wild-type; Fig. 5B). In
addition, the OATP1B3 variant (G583E) did not confer a survival
advantage after CPT treatment (Fig. 5C). Unlike the results
obtained from OATP1B3 (wild-type), immunoblotting analyses
indicated that CPT treatment leads to increases in p53
downstream targets, P21WAF1 and NOXA, to a comparable level
between cells overexpressing the OATP1B3 variant (G583E) or
empty vector (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
CRC remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
death worldwide and resistance to chemotherapy is a major issue
in the management of recurrent and metastatic CRC. In this

OATP1B3 in Colon Cancer

study, we show for the first time that OATP1B3 is aberrantly
overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels in the majority of
colorectal adenocarcinomas and that OATP1B3 overexpression
confers an antiapoptotic effect against chemotherapy treatment
in colon cancer cells by altering the p53-dependent pathways.
These findings may explain one of the potential mechanisms
contributing to chemotherapeutic resistance in tumors harboring
wild-type p53.
The expression of OATP1B3 in colon tumors and in the colon
tumor cell lines (data not shown) was mainly cytoplasmic and
clearly different from the membranous expression pattern in the
normal liver. Cytoplasmic localization of OATP1B3 in tumor cells
has also been found in primary breast cancer tissues (14). The
aberrant expression of OATP1B3 in the cytoplasm of colon tumors
was the impetus to investigate whether OATP1B3 functions
differently in the setting of malignancy. The results from the
current study suggest that OATP1B3 overexpression in the
cytoplasm of colon tumor cells confers apoptotic resistance.
Previous studies have reported cytoplasmic localization of other
membrane proteins in cancer cell line models due to a defect in
plasma membrane protein recycling or tumoral changes in
signaling (e.g., PI3K activation; refs. 32, 33). However, the
mechanism responsible for the cytoplasmic expression of OATP1B3
in colon tumors remains to be determined. In further studies, we
have found that OATP1B3 expression is increased in premalignant
adenomatous polyps (data not shown). However, in polyps with
low malignant potential (hyperplastic), OATP1B3 was not detected,
comparable with our observations in normal colonic mucosa.
These results suggest that OATP1B3 up-regulation may be an early
event associated with colorectal tumorigenesis and maintained
throughout colon cancer progression and not just a marker of
cellular proliferation. We aim to further investigate the pathobiological significance of OATP1B3 overexpression in colon epithelium
by assessing the levels and variability of OATP1B3 expression in
larger groups of colon polyps with differing malignant potential
and histology.
In the present study, the prosurvival/antiapoptotic effect of
OATP1B3 seems to involve the interference with the p53dependent apoptosis pathways. OATP1B3 expression substantially
decreased the levels of p53 downstream targets despite elevated
p53 protein levels after chemotherapy treatment. The p53 protein,
often called ‘‘a guardian of the genome,’’ is the master regulator of
apoptosis after exposure to DNA damage, hypoxia, and cytotoxic
drugs, and it is the most commonly mutated gene in human
cancers (34). Although p53 mutations have been associated with
resistance to chemotherapy (35, 36), the predictive value of p53
mutations in determining clinical outcomes in CRC patients has
not been clearly established (37–40). This may be in part due to
methodologic problems assessing p53 mutation status in clinical
samples (41, 42). Resistance to CRC treatment is observed in
patients whose tumors harbor wild-type p53. Therefore other
mechanisms may interfere with p53 function, altering response to
chemotherapy. Our results suggest that OATP1B3 overexpression
may be one of the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy
resistance in tumors harboring wild-type p53. These findings
may provide additional insights into understanding the complexity in determining chemotherapy response. In an attempt to
identify the p53 wild-type/mutant status in colon tumors
overexpressing OATP1B3 and to discover possible correlations
between these two proteins in clinical samples, we performed
immunohistochemical staining for p53 using a monoclonal p53

www.aacrjournals.org

antibody (BP53.12) on the same tumor microarray that was
used for OATP1B3 staining. On analysis, approximately one third
of the samples showed an accumulation of p53 protein (26 of
the total 89 tumor samples evaluable for p53 staining and 20 of
75 OATP1B3 overexpressing tumors). The distribution of p53positive tumors was comparable among the OATP1B3 staining
designations indicating no apparent correlation between p53
detection and OATP1B3 expression in these clinical samples
(P = 0.325, Fisher’s exact test). Further evaluation of a possible
relationship between p53 accumulation and OATP1B3 expression
is warranted given our in vitro results and the inherent
limitations of immunohistochemistry as a means of assessing
p53 mutational status. It is possible that the apparent lack of
association between p53 staining and OATP1B3 overexpression
may be due to other regulatory factors that affect the complex
p53 pathway and mask the molecular relationships between p53
and OATP1B3 (43).
The results from our current study indicated that OATP1B3
overexpression in colon tumors is associated with the lower
transcriptional activation of well-known p53 downstream target
genes, P21WAF1, NOXA, and PUMA. These results are consistent
with previously published reports documenting that P21WAF1,
NOXA, and PUMA are transcriptionally regulated by p53 and play
important roles in apoptosis (44–46). Our results also suggest
that OATP1B3 overexpression in colon cancer cells harboring
wild-type p53 reduces the activation of the DNA damage response
protein PARP, an important marker of apoptosis (47). These
findings are consistent with decreased apoptosis levels and
attenuation of caspase activation in the presence of OATP1B3
overexpression.
OATP1B3 is known to mediate the transport of various
endogenous and exogenous substrates including steroid and
thyroid hormones, prostaglandins, and glutathione (8). Our results
indicate that OATP1B3 overexpression in p53 wild-type HCT-116
cells confers a prosurvival/antiapoptotic effect and also maintains
its transporter function in this setting. The overexpression of the
OATP1B3 variant (G583E) lacking the transport activity resulted
in no prosurvival/antiapoptotic effect, suggesting that the
antiapoptotic effect of OATP1B3 may be associated with its
transport activity. However, it is not a certainty that the
antiapoptotic effect of OATP1B3 is due to alterations in the
cellular transport of chemotherapy drugs because the antiapoptotic effect of OATP1B3 was observed with two drugs (CPT and
oxaliplatin) that have differing OATP1B3 transport properties.
There are differing reports regarding the transport of CPT and its
structurally related analogue, CPT-11, by OATP1B3 (48–50).
Oxaliplatin and other platinum drugs have been shown not to
interact with organic anion transporters including OATP1B3 (50).
Although our current results with OATP1B3 G583E variant
suggest an association between the antiapoptotic effect of
OATP1B3 and its transport activity, we cannot rule out the
possibility that a point mutation of G583E in OATP1B3 affects
both the antiapoptotic function and the transport activity of
OATP1B3 simultaneously, and that the two functions are not
necessarily linked. The results from our current study suggest
potential complexity in the molecular mechanisms underlying the
antiapoptotic effect of OATP1B3 overexpression. Further investigation using additional OATP1B3 variants or specific inhibitors of
the transporter activity would be necessary to confirm the
association between the antiapoptotic function and transport
activity of OATP1B3 and to determine the involvement of

additional mechanisms. Certain transporters such as MDR1 have
been shown to be localized in cytoplasmic organelles/vesicles
such as mitochondria and golgi apparatus and to be functionally
active as transporters (51, 52). Interestingly, MDR1 has been also
reported to provide protection against apoptosis independently of
its transport function (53, 54). Additional studies are required to
clarify the molecular mechanisms and/or transport substrates
contributing to the functional changes associated with OATP1B3
overexpression.
In conclusion, OATP1B3 is frequently overexpressed in a
majority of colon tumor samples but not in normal colonic
mucosa. Overexpression of OATP1B3 in colon cancer cells
conferred an antiapoptotic advantage against chemotherapy
treatment, by interfering with p53 transcriptional activity.
These findings provide further justifications to investigate the
