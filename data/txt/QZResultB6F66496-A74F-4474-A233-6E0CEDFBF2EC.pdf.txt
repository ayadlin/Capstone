ABSTRACT
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine, which
was shown to be upregulated in cancers and to exhibit tumor promoting properties.
Unlike other cytokines, MIF is ubiquitously present in the circulation and tissue of
healthy subjects. We recently described a previously unrecognized, disease-related
isoform of MIF, designated oxMIF, which is present in the circulation of patients with
different inflammatory diseases. In this article, we report that oxMIF is also linked to
different solid tumors as it is specifically expressed in tumor tissue from patients with
colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer. Furthermore, oxMIF can be specifically
targeted by a subset of phage display-derived fully human, monoclonal anti-MIF
antibodies (mAbs) that were shown to neutralize pro-tumorigenic activities of MIF in
vivo. We further demonstrate that anti-oxMIF mAbs sensitize human cancer cell lines
(LNCaP, PC3, A2780 and A2780ADR) to the action of cytotoxic drugs (mitoxantrone,
cisplatin and doxorubicin) in vitro and in an A2780 xenograft mouse model of ovarian
cancer. We conclude that oxMIF is the disease related isoform of MIF in solid tumors
and a potential new diagnostic marker and drug target in cancer.

regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [7, 18, 19].
Furthermore, MIF promotes a pro-inflammatory tumor
microenvironment (TME) by induction of cytokines and
other mediators of inflammation, such as TNF-α [20], nitric
oxide [21] and prostaglandin E2 [12]. Tumor associated
macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs) from MIF-deficient mice exhibit reduced
immunosuppressive activities resulting in improved
immune responses against melanoma [22]. Chemokine
functions of MIF are expected to play an important role
in altering the TME as they contribute to the infiltration of
leukocytes into tumors, thereby promoting cancer related
inflammation [20, 23].
In vivo, genetic knock-out of MIF was shown to
blunt tumor outgrowth in animal models of breast cancer
[24], skin cancer [25], gastric cancer [26], bladder cancer

INTRODUCTION
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a
pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes tumor growth
and metastasis in vivo by multiple modes of action [1–11].
MIF was shown to trigger cell proliferation by activation
of the central kinases Akt and ERK, thereby promoting
sustained activation and survival of immune cells and
cancer cell proliferation [12–14]. Genetic loss of MIF has
been described to cause p53-dependent growth alterations,
increased p53 transcriptional activity, altered RHOdependent cyclin D1 expression, and resistance to RASmediated oncogenic transformation [15–17]. MIF also
plays a key role in angiogenesis and neovascularization:
it is associated with hypoxic adaptation and stabilization
of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) [6]. In
this context, MIF was shown to contribute to the upwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[27], lung cancer [28] and fibrosarcoma [15]. Blocking
of MIF activity either by antibodies or stable RNA
interference reduced tumor growth in animal models of
colorectal cancer [29], prostate cancer [30], ovarian cancer
[20], neuroblastoma [31], pancreatic cancer [10], breast
cancer [9], melanoma [22, 32] and lung cancer [28]. The
involvement of MIF in human tumor development has
been substantiated by reports that describe higher MIF
levels in the circulation of cancer patients. Increased
circulating MIF levels are correlated with high tumor
burden and metastasis in e.g. prostate cancer, lung cancer,
colon cancer and ovarian cancer [7, 33–35]. MIF was
further shown to be upregulated in the tissue of different
tumor types, i.e. pancreatic, breast, prostate, colon, brain,
skin, and lung tumors [1, 3, 4, 7, 36–38]. However, MIF
cannot be considered a tumor specific marker as it is
constitutively expressed and secreted by numerous cell
types and significant levels of MIF can be found in the
tissue and circulation of healthy subjects [39]. At the
first glance, this fact makes MIF a challenging target for
specific therapeutic intervention.
We recently reported that MIF occurs in two
immunologically distinct redox-dependent isoforms,
termed oxidized MIF (oxMIF) and reduced MIF (redMIF)
[40]. RedMIF was found to be the abundantly expressed
isoform of MIF that can be detected even in healthy
subjects. In contrast, oxMIF represents the diseaserelated isoform which was detected predominantly in
the circulation and on the surface of cells isolated from
patients with inflammatory diseases. The fully human
monoclonal anti-oxMIF antibodies BaxB01, BaxG03 and
BaxM159 were shown to strictly differentiate between
redMIF and oxMIF and to exert in vivo protective effects
in animal models of inflammation [40, 41]. We therefore
sought to investigate the expression of oxMIF in the
circulation and in cancer tissue of patients with different
types of solid tumors, and to elucidate anti-proliferative
effects of oxMIF specific antibodies in combination with
cytotoxic drugs.

patients with ovarian cancer (23/42, 55% oxMIF positive;
median: 3.5 ng/ml) compared to plasma samples from
healthy controls. In plasma samples obtained from patients
with prostate cancer (8/14, 57% oxMIF positive; median:
2.4 ng/ml), breast cancer (8/15, 53% oxMIF positive;
median: 0.6 ng/ml), head and neck cancer (27/102, 26%
oxMIF positive; median: 0.0 ng/ml), renal cell carcinoma
(13/66, 20% oxMIF positive; median: 0.0 ng/ml), lung
cancer (7/26, 27% oxMIF positive; median: 0.0 ng/ml),
colorectal carcinoma (18/140, 13% oxMIF positive;
median: 0.0 ng/ml) and pancreatic cancer (7/40, 18%
oxMIF positive; median: 0.0 ng/ml), levels of oxMIF were
not significantly different from the control donor group
(Figure 1A). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that oxMIF
levels showed a considerable patient to patient variation,
and in each cohort, oxMIF levels > 15 ng/ml could be
found in some individual plasma samples.
As expected, a baseline level of total MIF was
detected in the same plasma samples from control donors
(median 3.8 ng/ml), which is consistent with the MIF
levels published in the literature [43, 44]. Significantly
increased levels of MIF were detected in plasma from
patients with ovarian cancer (median 9.6 ng/ml), prostate
cancer (median 8.9 ng/ml), breast cancer (median 8.4 ng/
ml), head and neck cancer (median 8.3 ng/ml) and renal
cell carcinoma (median 10.1 ng/ml) (Figure 1B). Total MIF
levels of patients with lung cancer, colorectal carcinoma
and pancreatic cancer did not differ significantly from those
of healthy controls. Correlation plots demonstrated that
plasma levels of oxMIF and total MIF correlated in oxMIF
positive patients, whereas no correlation was seen in
healthy controls (Figure 1C). When oxMIF was detectable,
this isoform comprised approximately 55-95% of MIF in
the circulation of patients, which is comparable to the ratio
found in patients with inflammatory diseases [40].
Taken together, our data confirm that (total) MIF
levels were significantly upregulated in the plasma
of patients with solid tumors, such as ovarian cancer
[35] or prostate cancer [33]. Circulating oxMIF was
significantly elevated in ovarian cancer patients, but not
in the other cancer indications tested. Most of the plasma
samples from patients with solid tumors did not show
detectable amounts of oxMIF. However, oxMIF positive
patient subpopulations were identified in all solid tumor
indications analyzed, with levels up to 80 ng/ml.

RESULTS
OxMIF can be detected in plasma of patients
with solid tumors
Previous studies described the elevation of MIF in
the circulation of cancer patients [7, 33–35]. However,
these studies did not discriminate between redMIF and
oxMIF. We utilized two previously established ELISA
methods [40] to quantify oxMIF and total MIF, which
reflects the sum of oxMIF and redMIF, in plasma samples
of cancer patients and healthy controls. In the control
donor group we detected small amounts of oxMIF (up to
10.7 ng/ml) in 20 out of 91 plasma samples (22% oxMIF
positive; median: 0.0 ng/ml) (Figure 1A). OxMIF levels
were significantly elevated in plasma samples from

OxMIF occurs specifically in malignant tissue
and can be detected in primary tumors and in
metastases of different cancers
MIF has been described to be upregulated in tumor
tissue [1, 3, 4, 7, 31, 34, 36–38]. Again, these studies did
not differentiate between oxMIF and redMIF. Hence,
we analyzed tumor tissue from pancreatic, colorectal,
ovarian and lung cancer patients for the presence of
oxMIF. However, denaturation of MIF - i.e. by fixation
73487

- leads to irreversible changes in the MIF structure which
results in binding of oxMIF specific antibodies and does
not allow a differentiation between redMIF and oxMIF
[40]. Therefore, conventional immunohistochemistry
(IHC) techniques including tissue fixation steps cannot
be applied to detect oxMIF in tissue. To avoid this
problem we developed an IHC method, which allows
for the specific detection of oxMIF, by using fresh
frozen tissue sections and avoiding any fixative prior to
incubation with anti-oxMIF antibodies. By using this IHC
technique, we analyzed tissue derived from patients with
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We observed
moderate to strong oxMIF immunostaining in pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) even at an early tumor
stage, i.e. stage I-II. Staining was more pronounced in
later stage tumors, i.e. stage III, with a prominent staining
of the invasion front (Figure 2A, middle and right upper
images). Adjacent normal pancreatic tissue did not show
immunoreactivity for oxMIF (Figure 2A, upper left
image). Unlike oxMIF, total MIF was widely expressed in
both, PDAC and adjacent normal pancreas tissue (Figure
2A, lower panel), as expected from the literature [38].

At higher magnification it is obvious that oxMIF was
predominantly located at the membrane and the cytoplasm
of tumor cells, but was also detected in some nuclei
(Figure 2B). Only weak oxMIF staining was detected in
the tumor stroma and some infiltrating immune cells like
macrophages (Figure 2B).
We next assessed oxMIF expression in tumor tissue
from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, including primary
tumors and liver metastases. We observed moderate
cytoplasmic and membranous staining for oxMIF in
tumor cells and stroma including some nuclei (Figure 2C,
middle and right upper images). A pronounced oxMIF
staining was also detected in vessel like structures.
We therefore probed consecutive slides of CRC liver
metastases for cytokeratin 20 (marker for colon epithelial
cells), CD31 (endothelial cell marker) and oxMIF. Colocalization of cytokeratin 20 and oxMIF was detected
by immunofluorescence microscopy indicating that these
oxMIF positive vessel like structures originated from
colorectal cancer cells (Figure 2D, lower panel) and were
not part of the tumor stroma originating from adjacent liver
tissue (Figure 2D, upper panel). Adjacent normal colon

mucosa and liver tissue did not show immunoreactivity
for oxMIF (Figure 2C, upper left image). In contrast,
total MIF was widely expressed in both, CRC (primary
and metastatic) derived tissue and adjacent colon mucosa
(Figure 2C, lower panel).
We further investigated oxMIF expression in
ovarian cancer tissue: weak to strong cytoplasmic and
membranous oxMIF staining, depending on the tumor type
was observed in apical papillary tumor cells and in cells
within the papillary projections as well as in the tumor
stroma (Figure 2E, upper panel). The strongest staining
was evident in adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma
and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (Figure 2E and data not
shown). OxMIF was not detected in normal ovarian tissue
(Figure 2E, upper left image). In addition, we assessed
the expression of oxMIF in a customized ovarian cancer
tissue micro array (TMA) including 37 ovarian cancer
cores and 3 normal ovarian tissue cores. By applying
digital image analysis (DIA) single tumor cores were
analyzed and the stained tissue area was calculated after
accounting for background staining. The result of this DIA
demonstrated that oxMIF was significantly overexpressed
in ovarian cancer compared to normal ovarian tissue
(Figure 2F, upper panel; Supplementary Figure S1). Total
MIF showed a moderate to strong uniform staining in
each of the tumor cores (tumor cells and stroma) as well
as in normal ovarian tissue (Figure 2E, lower panel). DIA
revealed no difference in total MIF expression between
normal and cancerous tissue (Figure 2F, lower panel;
Supplementary Figure S1). We furthermore analyzed
ascites fluid from ovarian cancer patients by ELISA to
determine the amount of oxMIF and total MIF. OxMIF
levels varied from 0 ng/ml to amounts as high as 200 ng/
ml (67/99, 68% oxMIF positive; median: 1.6 ng/ml). Total
MIF levels were slightly higher and ranged from 0 ng/ml
to 260 ng/ml (median: 5.1 ng/ml) (Figure 2G).
Finally, we examined several sections of fresh
frozen tumor blocks from non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients and adjacent non-neoplastic lung
epithelium for the presence of oxMIF. We detected oxMIF
(weak to strong cytoplasmic staining) in most of the lung
cancer samples. Staining intensity varied between the
different types of NSCLC, with most prominent staining in
adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (Figure
2H, upper panel). In some samples, patches of cytoplasmic
oxMIF staining were visible in apical tumor cells and
oxMIF immunostaining was also apparent in the stroma
(Figure 2H, upper panel). For total MIF, we again detected
a moderate to strong uniform staining in tumor cells and
tumor stroma of most tumor cores as well as in normal
lung tissue (Figure 2H, lower panel). No immunoreactivity
was seen in tissue sections that were incubated with
human or rabbit matched isotype IgG control antibodies
(Figure 2A, 2C, 2E, 2H – insets in middle/second panels).
The IHC analyses demonstrate that oxMIF can be
specifically detected in different cancer tissues, whilst
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

it is not detectable in adjacent non-tumorous tissue.
Therefore, this study provides new evidence that oxMIF
is a promising tissue marker for diagnostic purposes in
solid cancers and can be detected prominently at primary
tumor sites and corresponding metastases.

Anti-oxMIF mAbs sensitize cancer cells to the
action of cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo
We have previously described that the fully human
antibodies BaxB01, BaxG03 and BaxM159 are specific for
oxMIF and do not bind to redMIF [40]. We furthermore
described that these three antibodies were able to reduce
cell growth and viability of prostate cancer cell lines
in vitro and in vivo in a monotherapeutic setting [42],
whereas a fully human antibody that does not discriminate
between oxMIF and redMIF failed to exert significant
beneficial anti-tumor effects in vivo (data not shown).
Mechanistically, these anti-oxMIF antibodies inhibited
proliferation and survival signaling pathways and reduced
the level of active ERK1/2 and active Akt, and led to an
accumulation of active caspase 3 [42], which is in line
with reports on the effects of neutralizing biologic activity
of MIF [12, 14].
Due to narrow therapeutic indices, toxicities and
development of tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic
drugs, current treatment strategies include combinations
of targeted therapy with one or more chemotherapeutic
agents. Examples include trastuzumab (anti-HER2/neu) in
combination with paclitaxel in breast cancer [45], rituximab
(anti-CD20) in combination with cyclophosphamide/
doxorubicin/vincristine/dexamethasone in non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma [46] or cetuximab (anti-EGFR) in combination
with irinotecan in colon cancer [47]. We assessed whether
the combination of anti-oxMIF antibody BaxM159 and
chemotherapeutics have synergistic effects on tumor
cell growth inhibition compared to single agents in vitro
and in vivo. As shown in Figure 3, sensitization of the
prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (androgen-receptor
positive) or PC3 (androgen-receptor negative) with
BaxM159 significantly reduced the half-maximal effective
concentration (EC50) of mitoxantrone by 40% and 30%,
respectively (Figure 3A and Figure 3B). In addition, we
found that BaxM159 also sensitized the ovarian cancer cell
line A2780 to cisplatin and doxorubicin (= adriamycin).
In vitro, BaxM159 reduced the EC50 of cisplatin and
doxorubicin by about 70% and 30%, respectively (Figure
3C and Figure 3D). Of note, BaxM159 was also able to
significantly sensitize the adriamycin-resistant ovarian
cancer cell line A2780ADR to the action of doxorubicin
by reducing the EC50 by 25% (Figure 3E). We next sought
to translate this in vitro synergistic effect of combinatory
treatment into an in vivo setting. Mice bearing A2780
ovarian xenografts were treated with 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin
once a week, either in combination with 15 mg/kg
BaxM159 or with 15 mg/kg isotype control IgG every

other day. Combination of cisplatin with BaxM159 resulted
in significantly reduced final tumor weights (~ 45%) when
compared to cisplatin and irrelevant control  antibody
treated mice (Figure 3F). Our results demonstrate the
capability of anti-oxMIF mAbs to sensitize cancer cells
to cytotoxic agents which results in an improved antitumorigenic effect.

is specifically expressed in the tissue of all human cancer
types investigated. Remarkably, oxMIF was detected
in tissue of early stage adenocarcinomas of pancreatic
and colon cancer, as well as in early stage lung and
ovarian tumors. In many ovarian cancer patients oxMIF
furthermore accumulated in abdominal ascites, supporting
the assumptions that oxMIF expression is linked to the
tumor tissue and that oxMIF is released during disease
progression. Immunofluorescence analyses of liver
metastases proved that oxMIF expression originated from
colon epithelial tumor cells. In view of recent findings
where MIF was shown to be a key mediator of PDAC
metastasis [10], oxMIF is likely to play a role in liver
niche formation and CRC metastasis.
A targeted MIF-directed therapy seems to be
challenging due to high MIF plasma levels and its
ubiquitous expression in tissue and cells with normal
morphology. The specific expression of oxMIF in
cancerous tissue allows for targeted inhibition of diseaserelated functions of MIF in cancer. Anti-oxMIF antibodies
BaxB01, BaxG03 and BaxM159 were shown to inhibit
growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [42].
Here we demonstrated that anti-oxMIF antibody BaxM159
was capable of sensitizing prostate and ovarian cancer
cells to the action of cytotoxic drugs in vitro. Combining

DISCUSSION
We recently described the identification of oxMIF,
a disease-related isoform of MIF that is predominantly
expressed in patients with inflammatory diseases,
whereas redMIF represents the ubiquitous isoform of MIF
that is abundantly expressed even in healthy subjects.
In inflammatory diseases, oxMIF was detected in the
circulation of patients, therefore representing a systemic
marker of inflammation [40]. In contrast, in cancer
indications plasma levels of oxMIF were significantly
elevated in samples from ovarian cancer patients, but not
in patients with other solid tumor types investigated.
We furthermore described that oxMIF expression
is linked to sites of inflammation [40]. This linkage
of oxMIF expression to diseased tissue seems to be
particularly pronounced in cancer indications, as oxMIF

values for cytotoxic drugs were calculated by fitting the data points to a four-parameter variable slope equation (Hill-equation). Curve fits

cisplatin with BaxM159 also increased the cytotoxicity of
cisplatin in vivo, which resulted in reduced A2780 tumor
growth rates in mice. A fully human anti-MIF antibody
which does not distinguish between redMIF and oxMIF
failed to exert a significant beneficial effect in a mouse
xenograft prostate cancer model (results not shown). This
is in line with the previously reported observation that
recombinant human antibodies that do not discriminate
between the two isoforms failed to show beneficial
therapeutic effects in animal models of inflammation [40].
Reduction of the level of activated kinases Akt
and ERK1/2 and activation of caspases were previously
described as underlying mechanisms for the anti-tumor
effects of anti-oxMIF antibodies [42]. As oxMIF could
be detected on the cellular surface and in the cytoplasm
of tumor cells, it will be of interest to discover whether
anti-oxMIF antibodies interfere with extracellular and/
or intracellular functions of MIF which convert into
an inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 signaling and in an
activation of caspases. An interference of anti-oxMIF
antibodies with intrinsic MIF activities is conceivable as
an increased caspase activity could be mediated not only
via Akt but also via the MIF-p53 axis [15]. Anti-oxMIF
antibodies induce neither complement-dependent cell lysis
nor antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Therefore,
the beneficial effect of down regulation of these kinases
might have been enhanced by the direct cytotoxic effects
of cisplatin, doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. It will also
be important to identify immunomodulatory activities of
anti-oxMIF antibodies in the tumor microenvironment
as processes of stromal remodeling could be crucial for
an increased cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics when
administered in combination with anti-oxMIF antibodies.
An interference of anti-oxMIF antibodies with proangiogenic properties of MIF might also be a part of the
mechanism of action and should therefore be addressed
in future investigations. Furthermore, the exact structural
basis for the rearrangement of redMIF to the diseased
related isoform oxMIF as well as MIF binding proteins
and receptors that are involved in regulating this transition
are currently unknown and require further investigations.
Taken together, we demonstrated that oxMIF is a
new therapeutic target in solid tumors and that anti-oxMIF
antibodies are a new class of potent inhibitors of MIFrelated functions in tumorigenesis with a promising use
in combination therapy. We also highlight oxMIF as a
compelling new tissue marker which might be important
for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, especially in
combination with treatment strategies.

Monoclonal rabbit anti-MIF antibodies were generated
by immunization of rabbits with recombinant MIF,
spleens were resected and B-cells were used for RabMabHybridomatechnology (Epitomics, Abcam). High affinity
hybridoma clones were selected and RabMab IgGs were
purified from cell culture supernatant over protein A
columns. Recombinant MIF was expressed in E. coli and
purified as described [41]. Mitoxantrone, cisplatin and
doxorubicin were obtained as commercial formulations
approved for human use (Ebexantron®, Platinol®,
Adriblastin®).

Human sample collection
Plasma samples from healthy subjects (control
donors) were collected from volunteers in a normal state
of health, with no apparent signs of disease. Plasma
samples from control donors and cancer patients were
purchased either from Tissue Solutions Ltd., Asterand
Bioscience Inc., Cureline Inc. or Biochemed Services
Inc. Frozen tissue samples and frozen tissue micro arrays
were acquired from Asterand Bioscience Inc. and Biochain
Inc., respectively. All patients and control donors signed
an informed consent for sample collection.

A2780 ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model
Human ovarian cancer cells A2780 were harvested
from exponentially growing cultures and mixed with
growth factor-depleted matrigel (BD); 1 × 106 cells in
0.25 ml matrigel were then inoculated subcutaneously
into the right flank of female MF1 nude mice. One day
after inoculation, treatment (n=10 in each animal group)
was started by i.p. administration of the indicated doses of
BaxM159 and control antibody. Repetitive administration
of antibodies was done every other day. Cisplatin was
administered i.p. once per week at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg.
Treatment with cisplatin was started one day after the first
antibody administration. The sizes of tumor xenografts
were measured when their growth became evident
(typically on day 7) and volumes were calculated using
the formula V=0.5*a*b² (where “a” is the longest diameter
and “b” is the shortest diameter). Animal experiments
were carried out in accordance with the guidelines set
forth by the Medical University of Vienna (MUW) (Good
Scientific Practice Manual) and were approved by the
Animal Welfare Committee of the Medical University
of Vienna (Tierversuchskommission) and the Austrian
Ministry of Science and Research.

in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The indicated
concentrations of mitoxantrone, cisplatin or doxorubicin
and/or antibodies were added and the cells were incubated
for 48 h. Thereafter, the cells were detached with
Accutase®, pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in
ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50
nM calcein-AM. Flow cytometry (10,000 events recorded
per measurement; n=3 per determination) was performed
on a Becton Dickinson FACScan® with forward scatter,
sideward scatter and calcein fluorescence recorded in
individual channels. Analysis was done by WinMDI 2.9®
software. The geometric mean of the calcein fluorescence
was extracted and used as the parameter for further
statistical analysis.

reaction. Counterstaining and mounting was done as
described above. Full slide scans were acquired using an
Olympus VS120 slide scanning microscope at 20-fold
magnification (UPLANSAPO 20x, NA 0.75; PIKE F505/C
Camera, Allied Vision Technologies). Pictures are presented
at 10-fold original magnification. Analyses and evaluation
and quantification of stainings were performed by a board
certified pathologist (L. K.). Digital image analysis (DIA)
was performed with Definiens Tissue Studio® v3.6 program.

Immunofluorescence
Fresh frozen tissue slides were air dried, blocked
with BB and incubated with BaxB01 (4 μg/ml, in PDAB)
for oxMIF detection. The specimen was fixed in 10%
PBS buffered formalin (VWR). Furthermore, the sections
were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-Cytokeratin
20 (Dako M7019, 1:50) or anti-CD31 antibodies
(e-bioscience 13-0319, 1:200), and monoclonal rabbit antiBaxB01 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml) diluted in PADB+0.25%
TritonX-100. Rabbit and mouse antibodies were detected
by Alexa Fluor® conjugated secondary antibodies (Life
Technologies A11034 and A21424, 1:2000) diluted in
PADB+0.25% TritonX-100. The slides were rinsed in PBS
and coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade
reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies). Pictures were
taken at 20-fold magnification (LUCPlanFLN 20x, NA
0.45) with an Olympus inverted microscope (VS81) using
a mercury lamp and the filters DAPI (U-MWU2), FITC
(U-MWIBA3) and TRITC (U-MWIGA3), and a XM10
camera (Olympus).

ELISAs
Quantitative determination of oxMIF and total MIF
was done as described previously [40].

Immunohistochemistry
To detect oxMIF, fresh frozen tissue slides were air
dried, blocked (BB: 20% goat serum / 2% BSA / 0.2% fish
gelatin) and incubated with biotinylated primary antibody
(biotinylated BaxB01 or biotinylated non-immune human
IgG, both 5μg/ml) diluted in TBS containing 2% (w/v)
BSA and 0.2% (w/v) fish gelatin (PADB). The slides were
fixed in 10% (w/v) PBS buffered formalin solution (VWR)
and permeabilized in 0.1% TritonX-100 in TBS for prior
addition of the enzyme block solution (Dual Endogenous
Enzyme Block, Dako). Sections were incubated with
RTU Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories)
and developed with ImmPact DAB substrate (Vector
Laboratories). Alternatively, non-labeled BaxB01 (1 μg/
ml, prior-fixation) and monoclonal rabbit-anti-BaxB01
antibodies (0.5 μg/ml) in combination with goat antirabbit-HRP (Thermo Scientific, 31460, 1:500) were used
to detect oxMIF. Following chromogenesis, the sections
were washed in tap water, counterstained with hematoxylin
(Vector Laboratories), dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in
xylene and coverslips were mounted with Vecta®Mount
permanent mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).
To detect total MIF, fresh frozen tissue slides
were fixed in 10% PBS buffered formalin (VWR) and
permeabilized by incubating the sections with 0.1%
TritonX-100 in TBS. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked
by incubating the tissue sections with dual endogenous
peroxidase block (Dako). Unspecific binding was blocked
with BB. The sections were incubated with monoclonal
rabbit anti-MIF antibodies (1 μg/ml) or commercial
polyclonal rabbit anti-MIF antibodies (FL115 Santa Cruz;
1:200) and rabbit IgG isotype control diluted in PADB.
The staining was done using goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Thermo
Scientific) diluted in PADB or ImmPRESS HRP Anti-Rabbit
Ig (Vector Laboratories). The Liquid DAB+ Substrate
Chromogen System (Dako) was used for chromogenic

Statistics
Distributions were evaluated by KolmogorovSmirnov test. If normal distribution was confirmed,
data were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by
Dunnett’s multiple comparison. Otherwise data were
evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s
multiple comparison. Two groups were compared by
unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test (normal distribution) or
Mann-Whitney-test. Correlation analysis was done using
Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression.
