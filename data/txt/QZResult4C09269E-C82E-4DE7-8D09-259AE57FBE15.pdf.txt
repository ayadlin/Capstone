ABSTRACT
Here, we found that BTG1 overexpression inhibited proliferation, migration
and invasion, induced G2/M arrest, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis in
BGC-823 and MKN28 cells (p < 0.05). BTG1 transfectants showed a higher mRNA
expression of Cyclin D1 and Bax, but a lower mRNA expression of cdc2, p21, mTOR
and MMP-9 than the control and mock (p < 0.05). After treated with cisplatin, MG132,
paclitaxel and SAHA, both BTG1 transfectants showed lower mRNA viability and higher
apoptosis than the control in both time- and dose-dependent manners (p < 0.05)
with the hypoexpression of chemoresistance -related genes (slug, CD147, GRP78,
GRP94, FBXW7 TOP1, TOP2 and GST-π). BTG1 expression was restored after 5-aza2′- deoxycytidine treatment in gastric cancer cells. BTG1 expression was statistically
lower in gastric cancer than non-neoplastic mucosa and metastatic cancer in lymph
node (p < 0.05). BTG1 expression was positively correlated with depth of invasion,
lymphatic and venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM staging and worse
prognosis (p < 0.05). The diffuse-type carcinoma showed less BTG1 expression
than intestinal- and mixed-type ones (p < 0.05). BTG1 overexpression suppressed
tumor growth and lung metastasis of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting proliferation,
enhancing autophagy and apoptosis in xenograft models. It was suggested that downregulated BTG1 expression might promote gastric carcinogenesis partially due to its
promoter methylation. BTG1 overexpression might reverse the aggressive phenotypes
and be employed as a potential target for gene therapy of gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Despite a worldwide decline in incidence and
mortality since the second half of the 20th century, gastric
cancer remains the fourth most common and the second
most frequent death cause from cancer [1, 2]. Although
the patients with gastric cancer are treated with surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or gene
therapy, the identification of novel biomarkers and gene

export signals [3]. There is a highest BTG1 expression
in G0/G1 phases and its down-regulation with cells cycle
progressing through G1 phase [4]. Further investigation
shows that BTG1 protein can bind to nuclear receptor
TRα and the myogenic factor MyoD [5], protein arginine
methyltransferase 1 [6], and human carbon catabolite
repressor protein-associative factor 1 [7]. BTG1
overexpression was detectable in apoptotic cells [8] and
helpful for anti-sense Bcl-2- induced cytotoxic effects
[9]. BTG1 was reported to enhance Hoxb9-induced
transcription to suppress proliferation in HeLa cells [10]. In
agreement with the report of Zhu et al. [11], we found that
BTG1 overexpression suppressed proliferation, migration
and invasion, and induced chemosensitivity to cisplatin,
G1 arrest and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells [12]. There
was a higher expression of BTG1 mRNA in normal tissue
than in cancer tissue, and in benign tumors than in cancer
tissue of the ovary. BTG1 mRNA expression was inversely
related to FIGO staging of ovarian cancers [12].
To clarify the roles of BTG1 in gastric carcinogenesis
and subsequent progression, we examined the expression
of BTG1 mRNA and protein, and its promoter methylation
in gastric cancer tissues, and compared them with the
clinicopathological and prognostic parameters of the
cancers. In addition, we focused on the effects of BTG1

overexpression on the aggressive phenotypes of gastric
cancer cells and clarified the relevant molecular mechanisms.

RESULTS
The expression and promoter methylation of
BTG1 in gastric cancer cells
BTG1 protein was expressed in gastric cancer
or epithelial cells at different levels by Western blot
(Figure 1A). To check its mRNA expression, we employed
RT-PCR and observed strong expression of BTG1 mRNA in
GES-1, AGS, BGC-823, GT-3 TKB, KATO-III, MGC-803,
MKN28, MKN45, SCH, and STKM-2, but not or weakly in
HGC-27 or SGC-7901 (Figure 1B). The amplicons proved
correct by direct DNA sequencing (Figure 1C). We detected
BTG1 promoter methylation in GES-1, AGS, BGC-823,
GT-3 TKB, HGC-27, MGC-803, MKN28, MKN45, SCH,
and STKM-2 using methylation-specific PCR, but not
or weakly in KATO-III or SGC-7901 (Figure 1D). After
treatment with demethylation reagent (5-Aza-dC), we
found that BTG1 promoter methylation was decreased and
its mRNA expression was restored in AGS, MKN28 and
MKN45 cells (Figure 1E).

Figure 1: BTG1 expression and methylation in gastric cancer cell lines. BTG1 protein expression (19 kDa) was detectable in
gastric cancer and epithelial cell lines at a very weak level with β-actin (42 kDa) as an internal control A. BTG1 expression was strong in
cancer and epithelial cells by RT-PCR, except HCG-27 and SGC-7901 B. followed by direct sequencing C. BTG1 methylation was found
in gastric cancer or epithelial cell lines D. AGS, MKN28 and MKN45 cells showed a high expression of BTG1 mRNA by RT-PCR and a
decreased level of methylation of BTG1 after treated with 5-Aza-dC E.

The effects of BTG1 overexpression on biological
phenotypes of gastric cancer cells

BTG1 overexpression could suppress migration and
invasion by wound healing (Figure 2I, p < 0.05) or transwell
chamber assay (Figure  2J, p < 0.05). BTG1 transfectants
showed a higher expression of Cyclin D1 and Bax, but a
lower expression of cdc2, p21, mTOR and MMP-9 than the
control and mock (Figure 2K, p < 0.05).
After treated with cisplatin, MG132, paclitaxel
and SAHA, both BTG1 transfectants displayed lower
viability and higher apoptosis than the control in both
time- and dose-dependent manners (Figure 3A–3B,
p  <  0.05). BTG1 overexpression decreased the
expression of slug, CD147, GRP78, GRP94, FBXW7,
TOP1, TOP2, and GST-π in BGC-823 and MKN28 cells
(Figure 3C, p < 0.05).

After transfected with pcDNA3.1-BTG1, both
BGC-823 and MKN28 cells overexpressed BTG1 at both
protein and mRNA levels (Figure 2A and 2B). There was
slower growth (Figure 2C, p < 0.05), mitotic disruption
(Figure 2D) and higher senescence (Figure  2E) in BTG1
transfectants than the control and mock cells. Cell cycle
analysis indicated that G2/M arrest in BTG1 transfectants
(Figure 2F). There was a higher level of apoptosis
evidenced by Annexin-V (Figure 2G, p < 0.05) and a better
differentiation by ALP activity (Figure 2H, p < 0.05) in
BTG1 transfectants than the control and mock. Additionally,

gastric cancers

methylation was not correlated with its mRNA expression
in gastric cancer or NNM (p > 0.05, data not shown)
As shown in Figure 5A–5I, BTG1 protein
was distributed in the cytoplasm of infiltrating
inflammatory cells, deep propria glands, fundic glands,
well-, moderately-, poorly- differentiated, and signet ring
cell carcinomas, and metastatic cancer in lymph node,
occasionally in the superficial mucosa. BTG1 expression
was detectable in gastric NNM (52.9%, 305/577),
primary cancers (27.7%, 170/613), and metastatic
cancers in lymph node (48.6%, 86/177), respectively.
According to its frequency and density, BTG1 expression
was statistically lower in primary cancers than adjacent
NNM and metastatic cancers in lymph node (p < 0.05,
Table 1).

BTG1 protein was detected in gastric cancer
and adjacent non-neoplastic mucosa (NNM) at an
approximately equal level (p > 0.05, Figure 4A).
Compared with NNM, decreased BTG1 mRNA expression
was seen in 57.4% (13/23) of gastric cancers, while there
was no statistical difference between gastric cancer
and paired NNM (Figure 4B). Although we designed
methylation- specific primers of different BTG1 promoter
regions, no difference in BTG1 promoter methylation
was found between gastric cancer and NNM (Figure 4C;
58.3%  vs 83.3%; 66.7% vs 45.8%; p > 0.05). BTG1

As summarized in Table 2, BTG1 was more
expressed in elder male cancer patients than that in their
younger female counterparts (p < 0.05). BTG1 expression
was positively correlated with depth of invasion,
lymphatic and venous invasion, lymph node metastasis,
and TNM staging (p < 0.05), but not with distant
metastasis (p > 0.05). The diffuse-type carcinomas showed
less BTG1 expression than intestinal- and mixed-type
ones (p < 0.05). There was no difference in BTG1
expression between intestinal and diffuse components of
mixed-type carcinomas (p > 0.05, data not shown). It was

(p > 0.05, data not shown).
Follow-up information was available on 507 cancer
patients for periods ranging from 2 days to 10.8 years
(median = 69 months). Univariate analysis using KaplanMeier method indicated that the cumulative survival rate
of the cancer patients with weak, moderate, or strong
expression of BTG1 was obviously lower than that
without its expression (Figure 5J, p < 0.05). If stratified
according to depth of invasion, this significant relationship
disappeared (data not shown). Multivariate analysis using

which were excluded from the histomorphological features.
Additionally, there was no association between BTG1
methylation and mRNA expression in gastric cancers
or NNM. However, we found that 5-Aza-dC treatment
restored BTG1 mRNA expression, different from the data
of Kanda et al. [13]. These findings indicated that BTG1
methylation was partially responsible for its silenced
expression.
Opposite to the results from thyroid,
nasopharyngeal, hepatocellular, esophageal, gastric,
breast, and non-small cell lung cancers [13–19], BTG1
expression was positively linked to depth of invasion,
lymphatic and venous invasion, lymph node metastasis
and TNM staging of gastric cancer, which indicates that
BTG1 expression might be considered as a valuable
biomarker to predict aggressive behaviors of gastric
cancer. Furthermore, metastatic cancers in lymph node
showed a higher BTG1 expression than primary cancers,
which could be explained by a similar BTG1 expression
between primary and metastatic cancers, and its positive
correlation with lymph node metastasis. In contrast, Chen
et al. [21] reported that BTG1 expression was higher in

DISCUSSION
Here, we found that BTG1 protein was mainly
localized in the cytoplasm of superficial mucosa, infiltrating
inflammatory cells, deep propria glands, fundic glands
and primary and metastatic cancers, suggesting that BTG1
expression pattern had cellular specificity. Compared with
NNM, BTG1 expression was reduced in gastric cancer,
indicating that down-regulated BTG1 expression promoted
the malignant transformation of gastric epithelial cells.
Although the hypoexpression of BTG1 mRNA was found
in ovarian, gastric, thyroid, hepatocellular, nasopharyngeal,
esophageal, breast, and lung cancers [12–19], a genome-wide
transcriptomic analysis showed an up-regulated BTG1
expression in ovarian cancer [20]. Here, no difference in
BTG1 expression between cancer and NNM was found by
RT-PCR and Western blot. This paradoxical phenomenon
could be explained by BTG1 expression in stromal cells,

prostate cancer cell line LNCaP than its aggressively
metastatic line, AIC4-2. Our functional experiments
suggested that BTG1 overexpression might induce
apoptosis and senescence, and suppress proliferation,
invasion and migration. Xenograft model indicated that
BTG1 overexpression might inhibit the growth and
lung metastasis by inhibiting proliferation, inducing
apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, ectopic BTG1
expression enhanced the chemosensitivity of gastric
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer cells to SAHA, MG132, cisplatin and paclitaxel,
which was positively correlated with BTG1-induced
apoptosis and lower expression of chemoresistant genes.
Therefore, we  speculate that BTG1 overexpression in
more aggressive gastric cancers might be a reactive upregulation and inhibit aggressive phenotypes of cancer
cells in a negative feedback manner. BTG1 might be
employed as a potential target for gene therapy for
gastric cancer.

compared with intestinal-type or mixed-type carcinoma, p < 0.001.
In agreement with Kanda data [13] about BTG1
mRNA, a higher BTG1 expression was found in
intestinal- than diffuse-type gastric carcinoma, which was
supported by BTG1-induced differentiation. Moreover,
BTG1 was more expressed in elder men than younger
women patients, possibly due to its overexpression in
intestinal-type carcinoma commonly seen in the former
population [22]. Chang et al. [23] found that BTG1 was
more expressed in androgen-dependent LNCaP- FGC
cells and concluded that androgen might enhance BTG1
expression, supporting our result. In the present study,
intestinal- and diffuse-type carcinomas showed a lower
BTG1 expression than aggressive mixed-type ones [22],
in consistence with the positive association between BTG1
expression and aggressive behaviors of gastric cancer. No
difference in BTG1 expression detected between intestinal
and diffuse components supported the notion that different
components of mixed-type carcinomas might originate
from common stem cells, but follow distinct histogenic
pathways [22].
Reportedly, both Cyclin D1 and E1 activate CDKs
and promote G1-S transition, which is inhibited by p21.
CDC25B activates the cyclin dependent kinase cdc2 for
entry into mitosis [24]. BTG1-induced G2/M arrest was
positively linked to Cyclin D1 overexpression, as well as
cdc2 and p21 hypoexpression. The apoptosis-inducing
effect of BTG1 might result from the Bax overexpression
because of Bax-mediated mitochondrial voltagedependent anion channel opening for apoptosis [25]. It
was worth noting that the inhibitory effect of BTG1 on
migration and invasion might be positively linked to
MMP-9 hypoexpression because MMP-9 degrades various
components of the extracellular matrix and enhances the
tumor invasive and metastatic potentials [26].
BTG1 expression was documented as a marker
for favorable prognosis in thyroid, hepatocellular,
esophageal squamous cell, breast and non-small cell
lung cancers [15–19]. Here, a positive link between
BTG1 expression levels and poor survival of gastric
cancer patients was revealed and the significance of the
relationship disappeared if stratified according to depth
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of invasion, indicating that the prognostic value of BTG1
expression depended upon invasive depth of the cancers.
Kamalakaran et al. [27] identified CpG islands methylation
of BTG1 as a prognostic value independent of subtypes
and other clinical factors of luminal breast cancers.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that venous invasion,
distant metastasis and TNM staging were independent
prognostic factors for overall gastric cancers. These
findings indicate that BTG1 expression is an indicator for
the worse prognosis of gastric cancer patients, albeit not
independent of other parameters.
In summary, our study indicated that downregulated BTG1 expression might promote the malignant
transformation of gastric epithelial cells. Promoter
methylation of BTG1 partially underlies the molecular
mechanisms of its down-regulated expression. BTG1
overexpression might reverse aggressive phenotypes
and be used as a molecular target for gene therapy in
the future.

directly sequenced. BGC-823 and MKN28 cells were
transfected with pcDNA3.1-BTG1 or pcDNA3.1 vector
after seeding on dishes, selected by G418 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN, USA) with final
collection of monoclones.

Wound healing assay
1.0 × 106 cells /well were seeded in 6-well
culture plates. After they had grown to confluence, the
cell monolayer was scraped with a pipette tip to create
a scratch, washed by PBS for three times and cultured in
the FBS-free medium. Cells were photographed at 24 h
and 48 h with the scratch area measured using Image
software.

Proliferation assay

Transwell chamber assays

Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Japan) was employed
to determine the number of viable cells. In brief,
2.5 × 103 cells/well were seeded on 96-well plate and
allowed to adhere. At different time points, 10 μL of
CCK-8 solution was added into each well of the plate
and the plates were incubated for 3 h in the incubator and
measured at 450 nm.

For invasive assay, 2.5 × 105 cells were resuspended
in serum-free RPMI 1640, and seeded in the matrigel-coated
insert on the top portion of the chamber (BD Bioscience,
354481). The lower compartment of the chamber contained
10% v/v FBS as a chemoattractant. After incubated at 37°C
and 5% CO2 for 24 h, cells on the membrane were scrubbed,
washed with PBS, fixed in 100% methanol and stained with
Giemsa dye for the measurement. For migration assay, the
procedures were the same as above excluding membranecontrol insert (BD Bioscience).

Cell cycle analysis
The cells were trypsinized, collected, washed by PBS
and fixed in 10mL ethanol for 2 h. Then, the cells were washed
by PBS and incubated with 1mL RNase (0.25 mg/mL)
at 37°C for 1 h. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in
propidium iodide (PI) at a concentration of 50 μg/mL
and incubated at 4°C in the dark for 30 min. Finally, flow
cytometry was employed to examine PI signal.

of the samples was determined by Biorad protein assay kit.
ALP activity was calculated as U per μg of protein.

Gastric cancer (n = 613), adjacent non-neoplastic
mucosa (NNM, n = 577) and lymph node with metastases
(n = 177) were collected from surgical resection in the
Affiliated Hospital of Kanagawa Cancer Center (Japan).
The patients with gastric cancer were 427 men and
186 women (24~87 years, mean = 62.1 years). Intestinal
and diffuse components were subjected to establishment
of tissue microarray in 112 mixed-type carcinomas. Fresh
gastric cancer and matched NNM (n = 36) were collected
from the First Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning Medical
University and frozen at -80°C for protein, RNA and DNA

β-galactosidase staining
β-galactosidase staining was performed with
a senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining kit
(Beyotime). Cells were washed three times with PBS
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Next,
the cells were incubated overnight at 37°C in darkness
with the working solution containing 0.05 mg/mL X-gal.
Finally, cells were examined under a light inverted
microscope (Olympus).

in step-and-shoot mode with plain CT scan condition
of the x-ray source set: 2.5 mm slice thickness, 2.5 mm
interval, 80 kV tube voltage, 80 μA tube current, 512 × 512
matrix, 20 cm DFOV, and PedHead SFOV.

Pathology

Total RNA was extracted from gastric cancer
cell lines or tissues using QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit
(Germany). Total RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis
using AMV reverse transcriptase and random primers
(Takara). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed
and shown in Table 4. General and real-time PCR was
performed according to the protocol of Hotstart Taq
polymerase (Takara) and SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II kit
(Takara) respectively. The expression level was expressed
as 2-∆Ct, where ∆Ct = Ct (gene) – Ct (GAPDH) with
the control as “1” for quantitative RT-PCR. Amplicons
were subjected to electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel and
purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN,
Germany). After extraction, DNA was sequenced
using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems). The sequence data was compared
using BLAST.

RT-PCR and DNA direct sequencing

All tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formalin,
embedded in paraffin and sections cut at 4 μm. These
sections were stained by hematoxylin-and-eosin (HE) to
confirm their histological diagnosis and other microscopic
characteristics. The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM)
staging for each gastric cancer was evaluated according
to Union Internationale Contre le Cancer system [28].
Histological architecture of gastric cancer was expressed
in terms of Lauren’s classification [22]. Elastic-van Gieson
staining and D2–40 immunostaining were employed
to characterize the venous and lymphatic invasion
respectively. Furthermore, depth of invasion, lymph node
and distant metastasis were determined.

Xenograft models

Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)

Female BALB/c nude mice of 6–8 weeks were bred
and used for implantation. The animals were maintained
under specific pathogen-free conditions. Housing and
all procedures were performed according to protocols
approved by the Committee for Animal Experiments
guidelines on animal welfare of Liaoning Medical
University. Subcutaneous xenografts were established
by injection of 1 × 106 cancer cells /mouse to the axilla
(n = 10/group). Tumor growth was then monitored for
12 days. At the end of the experiment, mice from each
group was anesthetized, photographed, and sacrificed
for further analysis. Tail vein assay of cancer metastasis
was performed by intravenous injection of 1 × 106 cancer
cells (n = 10/group). For each tumor, measurements
were made using calipers, and tumor volumes were
calculated as follows: length × width × depth × 0.52.
The cancer foci on lung were also counted after mandelic
acid staining. The tumor and lung tissues were subsequently
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, and then embedded
in paraffin for block preparation

Genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets and
tissues using QIAamp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN). DNA
was modified chemically with sodium metabisulphite. The
bisulfite- modified DNA was amplified by using primer pairs
that specifically amplify either methylated or unmethylated
sequences of BTG1. The following methylated
BTG1-specific primers were used: sense, 5′-GTTTTTA
AGTTAAAAGGAAGGAAGTC-3′;
antisense,
5′-ATATCAAAAAATATTAAAAATCACGCA-3′ (BTG1
MSP1,-149~-289) and sense, 5′-TTTGAG GAGTTA
GTTATCGAGATTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-AAATAA
ATAAAAACCGCCTAACG-3′ (BTG1 MSP2, -517~-645).
The following un-methylated BTG1-specific primers
were used: sense, 5′-GTTTTTAAGTTAAAAGGA
AGGAAGT TGT-3′; anti- sense, 5′-ATATCAAAAA
TATTAAAAATCACACA-3′ (BTG1 USP1, -149~-289)
and sense,5′-TGA GGAGTTAGTTATTGAGATTTGG
-3′ and antisense, 5′-AAATAAATAAAAACCACCTAA
CACA- 3′(BTG1 USP2, -517~ -645). MSP was performed
in25 μL mixtures for 40 cycles using Hot-start polymerase
(Takara).

Computed tomography (CT)
GE LightSpeed CT was employed to image the
tumor size and lung metastasis. Briefly, the animals
were transported to and positioned in CT scanner while
still fixed to their poly-styrene bed. Before and after
administering a booster dose of 20 μL of contrast agent
Ioversol into tail vein, we scanned 2 bed positions
(separated by 40.6 mm along the longitudinal axis) to

transferred to Hybond membrane, which was then blocked
overnight in 5% skim milk in TBST. For immunobloting,
the membrane was incubated for 15 min with ani-BTG1
(Proteintech) or -β-actin (Sigma) antibody. Then, it was
rinsed by TBST and incubated with IgG conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (DAKO, 1:1000) for 15 min.
All the incubations were performed in a microwave
oven to allow intermittent irradiation as recommended
by Li et al. [29]. Bands were visualized with LAS 4010
(GE  healthcare Life Science) by ECL-Plus detection
reagents (Santa Cruz). Densitometric quantification of
target proteins was performed using Scion Image software.

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry

REFERENCES

Tissue microarray was done as described previously
and cut at 4 μm [22]. The immunohisto- chemical
procedures were performed as described previously [30].
The primary antibodies included anti-BTG1 (Proteintech),
anti-ki-67 (Abcam) and anti-LC-3B (Cell Signal)
antibodies. Omission of the primary antibody was used as
a negative control. As indicated in Figure 5, BTG1 protein
was localized in the cytoplasm. One hundred cells were
randomly selected and counted from 5 representative fields
of each section blindly by two independent observers
(Zheng HC and Gou WF). The expression was graded and
counted as follows: 0 = negative; 1 = 1–50%; 2 = 50–74%;
3 ≥ 75%. The staining intensity score was graded as
follows: 1 = weak; 2 = intermediate; and 3 = strong. The
scores for BTG1 positivity and staining intensity were
multiplied to obtain a final score, which determines their
expression as (- = 0; + = 1–2; ++ = 3–5; +++ = 6–9).
