Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The RAS/RAF mitogen activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) is highly active in many tumor
types including the majority of high-grade gliomas and expression of activated RAS or RAF in
neural progenitor cells combined with either AKT activation or Ink4a/Arf loss leads to the
development of high-grade gliomas in vivo. This strongly suggests that this pathway is necessary
for glioma formation and maintenance. To further define the role of this pathway in the
development of high-grade gliomas, we used the established RCAS/TVA glioma mouse model to
test the ability of activated MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), a
RAF effector, to induce tumors in vivo in the context of activated AKT or Ink4a/Arf loss. While
expression of activated MEK alone in neural progenitor cells is not sufficient for tumorigenesis,
the combination of activated MEK and AKT or MEK with Ink4a/Arf loss is transforming. The
data reveal that activation of the classical RAS/MAPK pathway, which is mediated through MEK,
leads to the development of high-grade gliomas in vivo and suggest that MEK may be a relevant
target for glioma therapy. To test this, we treated both mouse and human glioma cells with the
MEK inhibitor PD0325901. While this treatment induced apoptosis in a significant percentage of
the cells, the effect was enhanced by combined treatment with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235. Our results demonstrate that combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K/mTOR is a rational
strategy for the treatment of high-grade gliomas and may be an effective adjuvant therapy for this
disease.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The current standard of care for patients with high-grade gliomas includes surgical resection
followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and/or temozolomide chemotherapy. This treatment
regimen increases the median survival of patients with high-grade gliomas from 12.1 to 14.6
months and was also found to significantly increase two year survival to 27.2 percent
compared with 10.9 percent for radiotherapy alone (Stupp et al., 2009); however, more
effective treatment strategies are badly needed because the majority of patients experience
tumor recurrence and ultimately succumb to the disease (Stupp et al., 2009). Research in
glioma therapy has recently shifted towards targeting the specific molecular alterations that
underlie the pathogenesis of these cancers. Mutations or other genetic alterations in
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes often cause deregulation of signal transduction
pathways but determining which of these can be effectively targeted remains to be defined.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Alterations in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) growth factor receptors (EGFR, PDGFR, MET
and ERBB2), which result in constitutive downstream signaling of the classical mitogen
activated protein kinase (MAPK) (e.g., RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, are found in almost all World Health Organization (WHO)
grade II, III, and IV astrocytomas. The MAPK pathway is also activated in the majority of
WHO grade I tumors as a result of BRAF alterations (Jones et al., 2008). Together these data
suggest that MAPK signaling is important for glioma development. Activation of the this
pathway leads to cell cycle progression through Cyclin D1 activation (Furnari et al., 2007)
and inhibition of apoptosis by regulation of BCL-2 family member gene expression and
activity (Balmanno and Cook, 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The majority of gliomas also have homozygous deletions that functionally inactivate the
CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) locus (Ichimura et al., 1996). This locus
encodes two independent protein products, p16INK4a and p14ARF [reviewed in (Chin et al.,
1998; Roussel, 1999)]. p16INK4a is a specific inhibitor of Cyclin D/CDK4 or CDK6
complexes (Serrano et al., 1993). By inhibiting the kinase activity of CDK4 and CDK6,
p16INK4a blocks RB phosphorylation and prevents progression from G1 to S in the cell cycle
(Chin et al., 1998). p14ARF (p19Arf in mice) (Quelle et al., 1995), is a protein whose
physiological role involves stabilization of TP53 levels (Chin et al., 1998) and cell cycle
arrest in G1 and G2 in response to oncogenic stimuli (Kamijo et al., 1997; Zhang et al.,
1998). Disruption of the TP53 and RB pathways also occurs in gliomas through direct
mutation or deletion of TP53 and RB or amplification of HDM2 or CDK4, respectively
(Parsons et al., 2008).
Astrocytic gliomas typically contain inactivating mutations in the AKT signaling repressor
phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN). PTEN is a
phosphatase that functions to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Jiang et al., 1999). In
the absence of PTEN, levels of active AKT are elevated (Holland et al., 2000). This
signaling leads to progression through the cell cycle, increased proliferation, and inhibition
of apoptosis. AKT activation has also been documented in gliomas as a result of AKT
amplification and increased PI3K activity due to mutations within either the regulatory

subunit PIK3RI or the catalytic subunit PIK3CA (TCGA, 2008). AKT activation has been
shown to mimic loss of Pten in the context of glioma development in mice (Hu et al., 2005).

We and others have successfully used a somatic cell gene delivery method based on the
RCAS/TVA system to evaluate the role(s) of specific genes in glioma initiation,
progression, and maintenance. Expression of KRAS, CRAF, or BRAF in neural progenitor
cells in combination with constitutive AKT activation, Pten loss, or Ink4a/Arf loss leads to
the development of high grade gliomas in vivo (Holland et al., 2000; Hu et al., 2005;
Lyustikman et al., 2008; Robinson et al., 2010; Uhrbom et al., 2002). While it has been
widely accepted that MEK1 and MEK2 are downstream effectors of the RAF proteins,
several studies have suggested that mammalian RAF proteins might have other substrates.
These include but are not limited to NFκB, IκB, CDC25C, RB, BCL-2, and BAD
(Wellbrock et al., 2004). In addition, CRAF has also been demonstrated to be an effector of
BRAF (Wan et al., 2004). In this study we further delineated the downstream effectors of
RAS and RAF in glioma development for the purpose of identifying additional therapeutic
targets. Expression of a constituently active MEK1 mutant (MEK-GF) (Mansour et al.,
1996) in combination with Ink4a/Arf loss or constitutive AKT activation led to the
development of high grade gliomas in this model. While treatment with the MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 induced apoptosis in the majority of human glioma cells tested, this effect was
enhanced by combined treatment with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. Our results
demonstrate that combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K/mTOR is a rational strategy for the
treatment of high-grade gliomas and may be an effective adjuvant therapy for this disease.

Results
Activated MEK induces anchorage-independent growth of astrocytes in vitro when
combined with Ink4a/Arf loss or Akt activation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox primary astrocytes (Robinson et al., 2010) were used to evaluate the
expression and transforming potential of RCASBP(A)MEK-GF alone or in combination
with RCASBP(A)AKT or RCASBP(A)CRE. For comparison, the effect of CRAFΔ22W,
BRAFV600E, and KRASG12D expression was evaluated concurrently. Western blot analysis
of cell lysates confirmed gene expression in infected astrocytes (Supplementary Figure 1a)
and demonstrated protein function though assessment of phoshporylated Erk 1/2 (P-Erk) and
phoshporylated Akt (P-Akt) (Supplementary Figure 1b). N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes
infected with viruses containing CRAFΔ22W, BRAFV600E, MEK-GF, or KRASG12D in
combination with CRE or AKT expression formed numerous colonies in soft agar
demonstrating the ability of the mutants to induce anchorage-independent growth in
immortalized astrocytes, a characteristic feature of transformation. In contrast, N-TVA/
Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes infected with any of the viruses alone did not result in significant
growth in soft agar (Supplementary Figure 1b and data not shown).

with viruses containing MEK-GF (14/14) or CRE (14/14) alone survived during the 12 week
experimental time frame (Figure 1). A higher percentage of N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice
infected with viruses containing MEK-GF and CRE survived during the experimental period
(44%; 8/18) compared with mice infected with MEK-GF and AKT (31%; 8/26); however,
this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.758) (Figure 1). Brain tissue from all
injected mice was analyzed histologically. While none of the mice infected with viruses
containing MEK-GF or CRE alone developed tumors, gliomas were detected in 50% of
mice injected with viruses containing either MEK-GF and CRE or MEK-GF and AKT.
Immunostaining for the HA epitope tag confirmed expression of virally delivered AKT in
MEK-GF + AKT induced tumors (Supplementary Figure 2a). PCR analysis on DNA
extracted from the tumor samples confirmed the presence of MEK-GF in all tumors
(Supplementary Figure 2b) and all tumors also expressed nestin, which drives TVA
expression in these mice (Supplementary Figure 2c).

MEK-GF + CRE and MEK-GF + AKT induced tumors showed variable histologies but no
specific feature distinguished either cohort (Figure 2). All tumors showed a multifocal
appearance in the brain, mostly originating from the ventricular surfaces, forming solid
masses protruding into the ventricle or expansively growing into the brain parenchyma
(Figure 2a). All tumors showed a variable degree of infiltration into the CNS tissue,
resulting in a diffuse overgrowth of underlying structures. A subset of tumors showed a
biphasic phenotype, where an additional component of elongated, cytoplasm-rich tumor
cells with a glial phenotype was encountered. Further features that were variably present
were vascular endothelial proliferation (VEP) and geographic and/or palisading necrosis,
both present in a subset of these tumors (Figure 2b). VEP or microvascular proliferation
(MVP) is a feature of glial tumors that indicates malignant progression. This feature can be
found in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AO), oligoastrocytomas (OA) and in GBM. Most
tumors showed a uniform appearance of the tumor cell morphology with small, round
monomorphic tumor cells, frequent mitotic activity and variable extent of clear cell
cytoplasm, resembling anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (Figure 2c–f). Immunophenotyping of
these tumors showed variable expression of the glial marker GFAP and markers of glial
phenotype that are also seen in human gliomas, such as MAP-2 (not shown), Olig-2, and
doublecortin, but they were negative for the neuronal marker synaptophysin, which would
be expected to be positive in primitive neuroectodermal tumors (Figure 3). In conclusion, all
tumors showed a glial phenotype with variable morphological resemblance to anaplastic
astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas (Figure 2). No consistent
correlation between the genotype (e.g., CRE/AKT) and the presence of a specific cellular or
architectural feature, necrosis, vascular endothelial proliferation, or infiltration was seen.
The immunophenotype, although showing some variability, confirmed the range of
differentiation across both genotypes.

(Holmen and Williams, 2005). In this study, we used a pharmacological approach to
evaluate the effect of MEK inhibition alone and in combination with PI3K/mTOR inhibition
on glioma cell viability. The minimal concentrations required for complete inhibition of
ERK phosphorylation with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 and AKT phosphorylation with
the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 were initially determined by single agent
titration ranging from 100 nmol/L to 5 μmol/L in four human glioma cell lines and N-TVA/
Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes infected with viruses containing MEK-GF and CRE. Treatment
with 0.2 μmol/L of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 was sufficient for complete blockade of
MEK signaling and 0.2 μmol/L of NVP-BEZ235 was sufficient for inhibition of AKT
signaling in the mouse cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Treatment with 1 μmol/L of the
MEK inhibitor PD0325901 was sufficient for complete blockade of MEK signaling and 1
μmol/L of NVP-BEZ235 was sufficient for inhibition of AKT signaling in the human cells
(Supplementary Figure 3). To determine the effect of MEK inhibition on cell viability, NTVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes infected with either RCASBP(A)MEK-GF, CRAFΔ22W,
BRAFV600E or KRASG12D in combination with RCASBP(A)AKT or RCASBP(A)CRE
were exposed to 0.5 μmol/L concentrations of PD0325901. After 48 hours, apoptosis was
quantified using flow cytometry. Following inhibition of MEK signaling, no significant
apoptosis was seen in N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox mouse astrocytes (M.A.) or in immortalized
but non-transformed N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes infected only with a virus containing
CRE (Figure 4). However, treatment with PD0325901 led to significant apoptosis in NTVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes infected with viruses containing CRE in combination with
MEK-GF, BRAFV600E, or CRAFΔ22W. The ability of PD0325901 to induce apoptosis was
reduced in N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes infected with viruses containing KRASG12D or
active AKT (Figure 4). To determine the effect of combined inhibition of MEK and AKT
signaling, the same cell lines were treated with 0.5 μmol/L NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor, alone or in combination with PD0325901. Interestingly, treatment with
NVP-BEZ235 exhibited significant single agent activity with ~30% cell death in N-TVA/
Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes infected only with a virus containing CRE. N-TVA/Ink4a/
Arflox/lox astrocytes transformed with KRASG12D and CRE or CRAFΔ22W and AKT were
the only other cells that were significantly more sensitive to treatment with NVP-BEZ235
than PD0325901 (Figure 4). The combination of PD0325901 and NVP-BEZ235
significantly increased apoptosis in all of the cell lines tested with the exception of
KRASG12D/CRE and CRAFΔ22W/AKT. The enhanced activity was most prominent in NTVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes infected with viruses containing KRAS and AKT.
Treatment of these cells with PD0325901 or NVP-BEZ235 alone resulted in less than 5%
apoptosis whereas inhibition of both pathways resulted in >30% apoptosis (Figure 4).
Importantly, treatment with PD0325901 and NVP-BEZ235 alone or in combination did not
induce significant apoptosis in primary uninfected mouse N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox astrocytes
(M.A., Figure 4).
MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition induces variable apoptosis in human glioma cell lines
To evaluate the role of RAS/MAPK signaling in human glioma maintenance, we treated 12
glioma cell lines and normal human astrocytes (H.A.) with PD0325901. Single dose
treatment of 1 μmol/L resulted in complete ERK inactivation for the experimental duration
as measured by Western blot for phosphorylated ERK (Supplementary Figure 4) and

resulted in varying apoptotic responses after 48 hours (Figure 5a). While no increase in
apoptosis was detected in normal human astrocytes (H.A.), treatment with PD0325901 was
most effective at inducing apoptosis in LN229 cells and least effective at inducing apoptosis
in U-118 cells (Figure 5a–b). Phosphorylated ERK levels correlated with apoptotic response
to PD0325901 in LN229, which was the most sensitive and had the highest levels of P-ERK,
and U-118, which was the most resistant and had the lowest P-ERK levels (Figure 5b);
however, this effect was not consistent in the majority of the cell lines. Interestingly, cell
lines possessing intact PTEN were more responsive to single agent MEK inhibition as a
group compared to cell lines lacking PTEN. To investigate if targeting the RAS/MAPK and
PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways simultaneously would increase cell death, we treated the
panel of 12 glioma cell lines with 1 μmol/L PD0325901, 1 μmol/L NVP-BEZ235, or 1
μmol/L NVP-BEZ235 in combination with 1 μmol/L PD0325901. We observed significant
AKT and ERK inhibition after 48 hours as verified by Western blot (Supplementary Figure
4). Importantly, enhanced cell death was observed in nearly all of the glioma cell lines when
these inhibitors were used in combination regardless of PTEN status and no significant
effect was observed on the level of apoptosis in primary human astrocytes (Figure 5a). To
assess whether the increase in apoptosis following the combined therapy was synergistic,
additive or antagonistic, we treated two cell lines containing wt PTEN (LN18 and SF268)
and two cell lines containing known PTEN mutations (SF539 and U251) with 1 μmol/L
PD0325901 and 1 μmol/L NVP-BEZ235 alone or in combination for 72 hours
(Supplementary Figure 5). The treatments were performed in at least quadruplicate to ensure
that the statistical findings would be accurate and reliable. The test for the interaction term
was statistically significant in cell lines LN18 (P < 0.001), SF268 (P = 0.003), and U251 (P
< 0.001) indicating departure from additivity; however, additivity between NVP-BEZ235
and PD0325901 was not statistically significantly rejected in cell line SF539 (P = 0.215).
The combination effect was calculated for cell lines LN18, U251, and SF268 and results
showed that the apoptotic effect of the combination of PD0325901 and NVP-BEZ235 was
synergistic (Supplementary Figure 5). The degree of synergy was stronger in LN18 and
U251 as compared with SF268.
A negative feedback loop exists between MEK and PI3K signaling

Following treatment with PD0325901, we observed increased AKT phosphorylation in
several of the cell lines analyzed. Increased ERK phosphorylation was also observed in
several of the cell lines evaluated upon administration of NVP-BEZ235 (Supplementary
Figure 4). We confirmed these findings using an additional MEK inhibitor, U0126,
demonstrating that this phenomenon is not the result of off-target effects of one drug. In
10% serum, this effect could not be completely abolished through inhibition of both
pathways (Supplementary Figure 6); however, we found that in 2% serum activation of
AKT by MEK inhibition and activation of ERK by PI3K/mTOR inhibition was abolished by
treatment with both NVP-BEZ235 and PD0325901 (Supplementary Figure 4).

have been described (Newlands et al., 1997; Stupp et al., 2009). To assess whether
combined MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition is equally or more effective in inducing cell
death than temozolomide, the 12 glioma cell line panel and normal human astrocytes were
treated with 200 μmol/L temozolomide for 7 days (Beier et al., 2008). To provide a direct
comparison, we also treated the same panel of glioma cell lines with 1 μmol/L PD0325901
and 1 μmol/L NVP-BEZ235 in combination for 7 days. At 200 μmol/L, temozolomide
induced only modest amounts of cell death. SF295 cells were the most sensitive with ~30%
cell death. The combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K/mTOR proved much more effective
at inducing cell death than temozolomide. LN229 and LN18 were the most sensitive to the
combination therapy and demonstrated the highest levels of cell death at 94% and 83%,
respectively. U373 was the most resistant at ~40% cell death. Importantly, less than 20%
cell death was observed following treatment with the combined therapy in the normal human
astrocytes (Figure 6).

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

High grade gliomas have been found to possess multiple genetic abnormalities.
Incorporation of genomic analyses into major signaling pathways implicated in this disease
revealed alterations in three major pathways encompassing RTK signaling to RAS/
PI3K/AKT and the tumor suppressor pathways linked to TP53 and RB. RTK/RAS/PI3K
signaling was altered in 88%, the TP53 pathway was altered in 87%, and the RB pathway
was altered in 78% of the samples analyzed. Interestingly, 74% of tumor samples had
alterations in all three pathways further highlighting their importance in high-grade gliomas
(TCGA, 2008); however, the key elements that are required for continued tumor growth and
maintenance remain to be defined such that more effective therapies can be designed. We
previously demonstrated that expression of BRAFV600E in cooperation with activation of
AKT or loss of the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor genes can generate high-grade gliomas in
mice (Robinson et al., 2010). In this study, we have evaluated signaling downstream of
BRAF and observed that activated MEK, a RAF effector, is capable of inducing high-grade
gliomas in the same context. These data reveal that activation of the classical RAS/MAPK
pathway, which is mediated through RAF and MEK, is critical for the development of high
grade gliomas.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Four molecular subtypes of gliomas have recently been classified based on gene expression
signatures. These include Classical, Mesenchymal, Proneural, and Neural (Brennan et al.,
2009; Verhaak et al., 2010). MEK-induced tumors most closely reflect the Classical and
Proneural subtypes, which display the highest activity of the PI3K and MAPK pathways;
however, it should be noted that elevated levels of both of these signaling pathways were
detected in nearly all tumors analyzed (Brennan et al., 2009). Behaviorally, the MEKinduced tumors were more invasive than the tumors arising from BRAFV600E expression in
the context of Ink4a/Arf loss that we have previously described; the gliomas were most
similar to those induced by KRASG12D or BRAFV600E expression in the context of AKT
activation (Robinson et al., 2010). In contrast to the BRAF-driven tumors where clear
differences were observed in the context of Ink4a/Arf loss or AKT activation, no
distinguishing features defined the MEK-driven tumors in either context. These differences
may instead result from either the infection of nestin-expressing cells committed to different

lineages or variation in the level of expression of the delivered genes. The latency and
incidence of the MEK-driven tumors was most similar to that observed with BRAF and
AKT, BRAF and Cre, and KRAS and AKT. In contrast, both latency and incidence were
significantly higher in tumors induced with KRAS and Cre (Robinson et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on these findings, it is logical to assume that inhibition of the MAPK pathway alone
or in combination with PI3K inhibition may be an effective strategy for the treatment of
high-grade gliomas. A current challenge facing development of targeted therapies is
selection of the appropriate patient population for clinical trial evaluation. Combination
therapy that targets common downstream mediators of growth factor signaling such as
MEK, PI3K, and mTOR should be effective in the Classical, Mesenchymal, and Proneural
glioma subtypes that harbor mutations in upstream signaling components. Many inhibitors
targeting the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway are currently in clinical trials, including
inhibitors of RAS, RAF, and MEK (Roberts and Der, 2007). Two novel, orally bioavailable
MEK inhibitors (PD0325901 and ARRY-142886) demonstrated increased potency against
MEK (IC50: 1–10 nM) and had better biopharmaceutical properties including improved
bioavailability, lower metabolic clearance, and longer-lasting target suppression compared
with first and second generation MEK inhibitors (Wang et al., 2007). PD0325901 has shown
promising preclinical activity in vitro and in vivo against a broad spectrum of tumors and
objective patient responses have been reported in melanoma; however, neurotoxicity was
observed in a subset of patients (LoRusso et al., 2010). While this effect might be
considered detrimental for some tumor types, it is necessary and potentially beneficial for
the treatment of brain metastases and gliomas. Importantly, NVP-BEZ235 has been shown
to reduce PI3K signaling in an in vivo glioma model when administered orally (Liu et al.,
2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PI3K pathway activation is known to mediate resistance to MEK inhibitors in RAS mutant
cancers (Wee et al., 2009) and accordingly we observed greater resistance to MEK
inhibition in tumor cells with high levels of PI3K/AKT signaling. Interestingly, we also
observed negative regulatory feedback between MEK and AKT that amplify the signal and
promote resistance to the inhibitors. This cross-talk may explain why only moderate levels
of cell death were observed with single agent treatment. We found that combined inhibition
of MEK and PI3K/mTOR in low serum eliminated the cross-talk and synergistically induced
apoptosis in the majority of glioma cell lines tested. Importantly, the combination therapy
did not significantly increase the level of apoptosis in normal human astrocyte controls but
was more effective than temozolomide at inducing cell death in a large panel of human
glioma cell lines. In addition to maximizing response, this combination may reduce or
prevent the occurrence of both primary and acquired resistance, which remains a significant
obstacle to the successful attainment of a targeted agents’ therapeutic potential. Conversely,
it is possible that this multi-targeted approach may produce unacceptable side effects that
limit the therapeutic benefit of the combination. This will need to be determined empirically
through additional in vivo studies. Our data clearly demonstrate the potential power of
targeted molecular therapy for the treatment of glioma and highlights the necessity of
targeting multiple growth pathways to induce apoptosis. Combined treatment with
PD0325901 and NVP-BEZ235 has the potential to improve overall patient survival and

have important implications for the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at this disease.

DF-1 cells were maintained as described (Schaefer-Klein et al., 1998). Primary mouse
astrocytes have been described (Robinson et al., 2010). Human glioma cell lines were
maintained in RPMI with 5% FBS and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Normal human astrocytes were maintained in astrocyte media (AM) containing
astrocyte growth supplement (AGS) (ScienCell, Carlsbad, CA) with 2% FBS and 1 ×
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Virus propagation and infection

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Viral propagation and infection was performed as previously described (Robinson et al.,
2010).
Detection of RCASBP(A)MEK-GF integration
Detection of RCASBP(A)MEK-GF integration into the genome of the tumor cells was
performed by PCR. Brain tissue from injected and control mice was paraffin embedded and
5-μm sections were adhered to glass slides. The location of the tumors on the slides was
confirmed by histopathology on corresponding sections. The slides were de-waxed in xylene
and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Tissue from the tumors was collected using a sterile
needle and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNAeasy mini kit per the manufacturer’s
specifications (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Details of the PCR are available upon request.

Western blotting

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Western blotting was performed using standard procedures. Details regarding the specific
antibodies used are provided in Supplementary Information.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Dissected brains were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm sections
and adhered to glass slides. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or
left unstained for IHC. All immunostaining was carried out using the Ventana Benchmark or
Discovery automated staining apparatus (Ventana Medical Systems, Tuscon, AZ) following
the manufacturer’s guidelines. Details regarding the specific antibodies used are provided in
Supplementary Information.
Drug treatments and cell viability

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All cell viability assays were initiated 24 hours post cell line seeding and were carried out
for the times indicated in media containing 2% serum. Single treatment dosing of human and
mouse astrocytes and glioma cell lines with PD0325901 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX),
U0126 (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), NVP-BEZ235 (Novartis, Groton, CT) was based on
titration studies (0 – 5 μmol/L) examining phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT levels. Human
astrocytes and glioma cell lines were also treated with 200 μmol/L of temozolomide (Santa
Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). Vehicle control samples were treated with an equal volume of
DMSO. Cell death was quantitated using the Guava ViaCount® assay (Guava Technologies,
Hayward, CA) and apoptosis was quantitated using the Guava Nexin® Annexin V assay
(Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA). The Nexin assay uses two dyes: 7-AAD, a cell
impermeant dye, as an indicator of membrane structural integrity and Annexin V-PE to
detect phosphatidylserine (PS) on the external membrane of apoptotic cells. Samples were
prepared per the manufacturer’s specifications at the indicated time points and assayed
promptly.
Statistical analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Censored survival data was analyzed using a log-rank test of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of
survival for the n indicated. In vitro experiments were performed in duplicate unless
otherwise stated and data are presented as the mean with standard error of the mean
(S.E.M.). To assess if combination therapy with PD0325901 and NVP-BEZ235 produced a
synergistic response, direct measurements of apoptosis were obtained in replicates of 4 to 6
for each group. After log transformation, results were analyzed using analysis of variance
techniques for 2 by 2 factorial designs. The statistical significance of the interaction term
was tested at the two-sided alpha = 0.05 level to evaluate the additivity of the apoptotic
effects of PD0325901 and NVP-BEZ235. Statistically significant interaction terms indicate
a departure from additivity and that the effect of the combination of PD0325901 and NVPBEZ235 was either synergistic or antagonistic. For cell lines with statistically significant
interaction terms the following calculation was made to assess the synergistic effect of the
combination:
where A901, ABEZ, and A901+BEZ are the mean
apoptosis values for PD0325901, NVP-BEZ235, and the combination, respectively. S is the

Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier survival curve

N-TVA;Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice were injected with the indicated viruses at birth. Censored
survival data were analyzed using a log-rank test of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival.
No tumors were detected during the experimental period (12 weeks) in mice injected with
MEK-GF (n = 14) or CRE (n = 14) alone and it has previously been shown that no tumors
form in mice injected with AKT alone (Holland et al., 2000). There was no significant
difference in survival between mice injected with viruses containing MEK-GF + AKT (n =
26) (small dashed line) or MEK + CRE (n = 18) (solid black line); P = 0.758; however, a
significant difference in survival was observed between mice injected with MEK-GF + AKT
or MEK + CRE when compared with mice injected with either virus alone; P = 0.002.

a, b, c: Low power magnification of tumors induced by MEK-GF and CRE or by MEK-GF
and AKT. All tumors show a glial phenotype but with variable morphology. a. MEK-CRE
induced tumor showing diffuse growth with infiltration of the hippocampus (arrow pointing
to a cluster of cells infiltrating perpendicularly to the dentate gyrus). The tumor grows
diffusely, in monomorphic sheets of tumor cells but does not show necrosis or vessels with
endothelial proliferation. b. Tumor induced by expression of MEK-GF + AKT, but with
palisading necrosis (bright areas, arrows) which are a typical feature of GBM. c. A similar
morphology, but absence of necrosis in a tumor induced by expression of MEK-GF + AKT.
d, e, f: detail of these tumors showing a small-cell glial phenotype similar to (d) human
anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, e, details of a palisading necrosis of neoplastic glial cells
adjacent to a palisading necrosis and f, glial tumor with microvascular proliferation. Scale

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All tumors show similar immunoprofiles, with slight variation in the expression of
individual markers. (a–c) GFAP; (d–f) Olig2; (g–i) doublecortin, (j–l) synaptophysin; (m–o)
CD15 (LeX). The MEK-GF + CRE induced tumor shows a loss of GFAP expression in a
subset of cells, a feature that can be seen in anaplastic gliomas, such as oligoastrocytomas
(OA) or even anaplastic astrocytomas (AA). There is expression of Olig-2 and doublecortin,
but no expression of synaptophysin in the tumor tissue and very little CD15 expression. The
MEK-GF + AKT induced gliomas show variable expression of Olig2 and doublecortin. The
tumor cells are negative for synaptophysin and CD15. Representative images are shown.
The scale bar represents 160 μm.
