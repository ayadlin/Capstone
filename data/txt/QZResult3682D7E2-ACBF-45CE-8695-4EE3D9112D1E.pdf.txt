Abstract
For patients with solid tumors, the tolerance of surrounding
tissues often limits the dose of radiation that can be delivered.
Thus, agents that preferentially increase the cytotoxic effects
of radiation toward tumor cells would significantly alter the
therapeutic ratio and improve patient survival. Using a highthroughput, unbiased screening approach, we have identified
4¶-bromo-3¶-nitropropiophenone (NS-123) as a radiosensitizer
of human glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. NS-123 radiosensitized U251 glioma cells in a dose-dependent and timedependent manner, with dose enhancement ratios ranging
from 1.3 to 2.0. HT-29 colorectal carcinoma and A549 lung
adenocarcinoma cells were also radiosensitized by NS-123
in vitro, whereas NS-123 did not increase the radiation
sensitivity of normal human astrocytes or developmental
abnormalities or lethality of irradiated Zebrafish embryos. In
a novel xenograft model of U251 cells implanted into Zebrafish embryos, NS-123 enhanced the tumor growth-inhibitory
effects of ionizing radiation (IR) with no apparent effect on
embryo development. Similar results were obtained using a
mouse tumor xenograft model in which NS-123 sensitized
U251 tumors to IR while exhibiting no overt toxicity. In vitro
pretreatment with NS-123 resulted in accumulation of
unrepaired IR-induced DNA strand breaks and prolonged
phosphorylation of the surrogate markers of DNA damage
H2AX, ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein, DNA-dependent
protein kinase, and CHK2 after IR, suggesting that NS-123
inhibits a critical step in the DNA repair pathway. These
results show the potential of this cell-based, high-throughput
screening method to identify novel radiosensitizers and
suggest that NS-123 and similar nitrophenol compounds
may be effective in antiglioma modalities. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
The prognosis for patients with glioblastoma multiform has
improved only slightly over the last few decades. Randomized trials
have shown that radiotherapy improves outcomes (1) and results in
a median survival of 12 months (2, 3). A recent prospective clinical

trial found that radiotherapy combined with temozolomide
significantly improved survival, albeit by a modest 2.5 months (4).
Attempts have been made at increasing the radiation dose, either
with additional external beam radiotherapy (5), brachytherapy (6),
or stereotactic radiosurgery (7); no significant improvement in
survival has been shown. Thus, an agent which preferentially
enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation on glioma cells, but has
minimal effects on the survival of normal brain cells, has the
potential to improve the therapeutic result for these patients (8).
The major cellular pathways leading to sensing and repairing
radiation-induced damage have been extensively studied, and the
mechanisms involved have become attractive targets for agents
that have the potential to increase therapeutic gain when
combined with ionizing radiation (IR). This approach has identified some promising candidates (9–11), which are currently being
investigated at the preclinical stage. Another approach to identify
tumor-specific radiosensitizers is to use a cell-based assay, in which
the target may not be immediately known but a functional end
point (e.g., killing transformed but not normal cells) is used to
screen for and identify promising candidates. This approach has
the added benefits of being able to screen a much larger pool of
compounds that have been preselected to conform to desirable
pharmacologic properties, as well as the opportunity to ultimately
identify novel targets for radiosensitization.
We have used a stepwise, cell-based screening approach that
entails a simple end point, cell survival, to identify a novel radiosensitizing compound for glioblastoma multiform. Using the U251
human glioma cell line, we initially investigated the radiosensitizing
capability of 870 compounds within a commercially available
chemical library (Nanosyn, Inc.). We present here the preclinical
evaluation of a compound identified in this initial screen, 4¶-bromo3¶-nitropropiophenone (NS-123). Our results show that NS-123
enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiobiologically relevant doses of
IR in tumor cells without any measurable normal tissue toxicity
in vitro or in vivo by a mechanism that involves inhibition of DNA
repair pathways and primarily double-strand break (DSB) repair.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. A library consisting of 10,000 compounds was obtained from
Nanosyn. Eighty-seven percent of these compounds conform to four
Lipinski criteria and 98% to three Lipinski criteria, suggesting that they have
desirable pharmacologic properties (12). NS-123 (500 mg) was synthesized
both via a contract from Exclusive Chemistry Ltd. and as a generous gift
from Dr. Robert Mach (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Chemical
structure and purity of the synthesized product was confirmed by nuclear
magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy.

Cancer Research
Cell culture. All cell lines (American Type Culture Collection) were
incubated at 37jC with 5% CO2. U251 glioma, HT-29 colorectal cancer,
and A549 non–small cell lung cancer cells were grown in RPMI 1640,
McCoy 5A, and Ham’s/F12 medium, respectively, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin.
Nontransformed human astrocytes (NHA, Cambrex) were cultured according to the manufacturer’s instructions in astrocyte basal medium (Cambrex)
supplemented with ascorbic acid, recombinant human epidermal
growth factor, GA-1000, insulin, L-glutamine, and 3% FBS. In all of the
tissue culture experiments, NS-123 was readily dissolved in DMSO and
was added to cells such that the maximum concentration of DMSO was
0.1% v/v.
Chemical library screen. Six hundred U251 cells were plated per well in
96-well plates. Cells in each well were then treated with a different
compound from the Nanosyn library for 8 h at 2.5 Amol/L concentration.
Treatment was done with paired 96-well plates; one plate was exposed
to 4 Gy, and the other plate was an unirradiated control. One hour
after irradiation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium alone.
Four days later, the MTS assay was used to evaluate cell survival.
Absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a microplate reader
(Sprectramax, Molecular Devices). Radiosensitivity factors (RSF) were

density reading without radiation for each compound
tested with the assay.
Survival assays. Clonogenic survival assays were done as described
previously (13). U251, HT-29, or A549 cells were plated at different densities
in triplicate, treated with NS-123 or DMSO (alone) and irradiated 4, 8,
or 12 h later with a range of doses using 137Cs g-rays at a dose rate of
f4 Gy/min. One hour after irradiation, the medium was replaced with
fresh medium without NS-123 or DMSO. The cells were fixed 7 to 14 days
after IR and stained with crystal violet. Colonies greater than 50 cells were
then counted and normalized against the nonirradiated controls for
each treatment. Because normal human cells do not grow clonogenically,
MTS assays were used to assess survival. In previous studies, we showed
that MTS assays, when done on subconfluent cultures of tumor cells for
>5 days after IR, yield results that are comparable with those of clonogenic survival assays (Naczki and Koumenis, unpublished results). NHA
cells were plated in 24-well plates in quadruplicate at equal density,
treated with equal volumes of NS-123 or DMSO (alone), and irradiated
as described above. One hour after irradiation, the medium was replaced
with fresh astrocyte basal medium. Five days later, the MTS assay was used
to evaluate cell survival as above.
Immunoblotting. After treatments, whole-cell and nuclear extracts
were prepared. Equal lysate volumes were loaded on 15% and 12%
SDS-PAGE gels to assay for the histone variant H2AX (g-H2AX) and
phosphorylated CHK2 (P-CHK2) proteins, respectively. To assay for
phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (P-ATM) and phosphorylated
DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (P-DNA-PKcs) protein,
30 to 50 Ag of nuclear protein were diluted with an equal volume of
2 SDS and resolved with 6% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and then incubated with either
anti–g-H2AX antibody (1:5,000; Upstate), anti–P-CHK2 antibody (1:1,000;
Cell Signaling), anti–P-ATM (pSer1981) antibody (1:300; Calbiomchem),
or anti–P-DNA-PKcs (T2609) antibody (1:500; Abcam). To confirm equivalent
loading and protein transfer, membranes were probed with mouse antihuman h-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti–DNA-PKcs monoclonal antibody (25-4 at 1:5,000; NeoMarkers). All membranes were then
incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse or antirabbit secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive
bands were detected using ECL Plus chemiluminescence (Amersham
Biosciences).
DSB measurement using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and
number average length analysis. Cells were treated with 30 Amol/L
NS-123 or DMSO alone. Four hours later, the cells were either shamirradiated or irradiated with 4 Gy of 137Cs g-rays (Radiation Facility, Brody
School of Medicine, ECU) at the dose rate of 0.57 Gy/min and placed
immediately at 37jC in fresh medium without NS-123 and harvested at
different repair times up to 24 h (14). No significant changes in the

percentage of dead cells were detected by trypan blue exclusion as a
result of irradiation. After mixing of cells into low melting point agarose
(Bio-Rad) plugs (f200,000 cells per plug; ref. 15), each plug was placed in
10 mL of TE buffer for 1 h, followed by treatment with 1 mg/mL proteinase
K (Promega) for 2 h, and then placed at 37jC for lysis. Proteinase K solution was replaced every 24 h along with a daily 0.5% reduction in
N-lauroylsarcosine concentration. Lysed cell plugs were washed in NTE
buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0)
supplemented with 40 ng/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and stored in
fresh TE buffer. For the AscI (New England Biolabs) restriction enzyme
treatment, plugs were washed using 1-mL AscI reaction buffer [20 mmol/L
Tris-acetate, 10 mmol/L magnesium acetate, and 50 mmol/L potassium
acetate (pH 7.9)] for 1 h, replaced with fresh buffer every 20 min, and
then incubated for 24 h at 4jC. Plugs were incubated for 1 h on ice and
then moved to 37jC for 16 h. After incubation, AscI enzyme solution
was removed and replaced with 1 mL of ice-cold native stop solution
[70 mmol/L HEPES-KOH, 100 mmol/L KCl, and 100 mmol/L EDTA
(pH 7.6)]. Plugs were washed with TE buffer (six times, 1 h each), and then
equilibrated into 0.5 Tris-borate EDTA [TBE; 45 mmol/L Tris base,
45 mmol/L boric acid, and 1 mmol/L Na2-EDTA (pH 7.8)]. Samples and
molecular length standards were electrophoresed in a 0.85% neutral gel
prepared in 0.25 TBE in a Bio-Rad CHEF DR-II apparatus and electrophoresed using a dual pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pulsing
regimen, optimized for separation of DNA fragments ranging from 5.7 Mbp
to 9.4 kbp. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (1 Ag/mL) for 1 h and
destained overnight, and an electronic image was obtained using a
FluorChem 8800 imaging system (Alpha Innotech). Images were processed
using QuantiScan (BioSoft), and a densitogram was obtained for each gel
lane. A DNA dispersion curve, relating DNA length to electrophoretic
mobility based on all length standards, was determined from an analytic
mobility function as previously described using number average length
analysis (15).
Zebrafish maintenance, embryo irradiation, and drug exposure.
Zebrafish were raised in accordance with previously established protocols
(16) at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Embryos were
maintained at 30jC after transplantation procedures. The age of embryos
is indicated as the hours postfertilization (hpf) and days postfertilization
(dpf) for all experimental data shown. Embryos were either irradiated with
10 Gy or sham-irradiation, as previously described (16), immediately after
photography at 24 hpf. Selected embryos were incubated with NS-123
at a concentration of 30 Amol/L for 14 h before either irradiation or shamirradiation.
U251 xenograft Zebrafish model. U251 cells were stably transfected
with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) construct (pDsRed2-C1; Clontech).
Using a Nanoject II microinjector (Drummond Scientific), 1 to 100 cells
were transplanted into each Zebrafish embryo still in the chorion, from the
high stage of their development (f3.5 hpf) to the oblong-sphere stage
(f4.5 hpf). The transplantation site was localized either to the blastodisc
approximately halfway between the margin and the animal pole or the
center of the embryonic yolk sac. Morphologic analysis was done as
previously described (16). Transplanted embryos were examined under a
100 PlanNeofluor objective mounted on a Nikon TE-200 epifluorescence
microscope. Images of embryos bearing RFP-positive cells were captured
with a Hammamatsu CCD camera controlled with IP LabSpectrum v2.0.1
software (Scanalytics, Inc.). Image analysis and pseudocoloring was done
with Kodak Molecular Imaging software v. 4.0.5 (Kodak). Two images
were taken in the same focal plane in bright field and in transmitted light
passing through RFP filters and processed by Adobe Photoshop CS2
(Adobe).
Nu/nu mouse maintenance and NS-123 toxicity evaluation. Female
nu/nu (nude) mice (6–8 weeks old; Charles River, Wilmington, MA)
were maintained at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine animal
facility under conditions approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee.
NS-123 in DMSO was mixed with 30% propylene glycol (DMSO
concentration, <1%) and given, via an i.p. injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg,
to three mice on 3 consecutive days. The mice were monitored over 30 days
for signs of drug-related toxicity, lethality, and weight loss. Mice were

euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, and necropsy was done by a veterinary
pathologist (N. D. Kock). The heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, brain,
salivary gland, gastrointestinal tract, ovary, uterus, adrenal gland, and
thyroid gland were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at
least 48 h. The tissues were embedded in paraffin, processed routinely for
histology, cut at 4 to 6 Am, stained with H&E, and examined by light
microscopy.
U251 xenograft mouse model. U251 cells (5  106) were suspended in
0.1 mL of PBS and then injected into the flanks of nu/nu female nude mice.
After tumors formed (45 F 10 mm3), mice were randomly assigned into
one of four groups: DMSO + Sham IR, DMSO + 5 Gy IR, NS-123 + Sham IR,
and NS-123 + 5 Gy IR. NS-123 was given as described above. Groups not
receiving NS-123 were treated with the same volume of DMSO alone
dissolved in 30% propylene glycol. Mouse flanks were irradiated 4 h after the
second injection with 5 Gy (Precision X-ray, Inc.) given as one fraction or
Sham IR. Tumor volumes were measured every other day based on the
formula Volume = length2  width, wherein length was always the longest
dimension. Data are presented as average relative tumor volume (RTV):
RTV [dayX ] = volume [dayX ] / volume [day0]. The measurement of tumor
regrowth was calculated by the time needed to grow to 10 the treatment
volume. As per Seo et al. (17), the in vivo radiosensitizer enhancement ratio
was defined as the ratio T NS-123+IR/T DMSO+IR, wherein T is tumor regrowth
delay (days).

Results
Initial radiosensitizer screen and identification of NS-123.
The small chemical compound chemical library (Nanosyn) was
replicated in a 96-well format, and compounds were dissolved in
DMSO. Using the U251 glioma cell line, we initially investigated the
radiosensitizing capability of 870 compounds within the library.
The assay was optimized in terms of the number of cells, radiation
dose used, and the number of days incubated so that a decrease in
survival could be assessed. A picture of a pair of sample plates at 0
and 4 Gy is shown in Fig. 1A. NS-123 exhibited the highest average
RSF of 4.62 among the 870 compounds and was selected for further
investigation. The structure for NS-123 is shown in Fig. 1B.
NS-123 radiosensitizes U251 glioma tumor cells. We first
determined the effects of micromolar doses of NS-123 on
clonogenic survival of U251 cells without IR. As shown in Fig. 1C,
treatment with 2.5 Amol/L NS-123 for 12 h did not cause any
significant decrease in survival, which is in agreement with the
results from the screening assay. Treatment with a 5 Amol/L dose
for 12 h caused a modest (30%), but statistically significant,
decrease in survival. In time-response experiments, a 5 Amol/L

dose of NS-123 did not induce any significant loss of viability unless
it was given for 12 h as seen in Fig. 1D.
Next, we investigated the dose-dependent radiosensitizing
effects of NS-123 (2.5 and 5.0 Amol/L concentration) in U251 cells
(Fig. 2A). Radiosensitization was evident at 2.5 Amol/L, a dose
at which NS-123 did not cause any significant loss of viability,
and at the radiobiologically relevant IR dose of 2 Gy used
in fractionated radiation schemes. Therefore, NS-123 can act as
a true radiosensitizer at low micromolar concentrations. Corresponding dose enhancement ratios (DER) at 0.1 survival were
1.3 (2.5 Amol/L NS-123) and 2.0 (5.0 Amol/L NS-123). We
then investigated the time-dependent radiosensitizing effects of
5.0 Amol/L NS-123 in U251 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, NS-123
induced a dose-dependent increase in radiosensitization. Corresponding DER at 0.1 survival were 1.2 (4 h preincubation with
NS-123), 1.4 (8 h), and 1.9 (12 h).
NS-123 radiosensitizes HT-29 colorectal cancer cells and
A549 lung tumor cells. To exclude the possibility that the
radiosensitizing effect of NS-123 was specific to a single cell line,
we investigated if NS-123 could radiosensitize additional cell lines
of different tissue origin. Thus, we did clonogenic survival assays.

Pretreatment of HT-29 colorectal cancer cells and A549 non–
small cell lung cancer cells with NS-123 induced significant
radiosensitization in both cell lines (Fig. 2C and D), with DER
values at 0.1 survival of 3.0 and 1.4, respectively. These results show
that the radiosensitization of NS-123 is not restricted to only one
cell line.
NS-123 does not radiosensitize normal cells. The objective of
any combination of therapeutic agents is to achieve an improved
therapeutic result, which is a function of both tumor response and
normal tissue damage (8). No improvement in the therapeutic
result of IR is gained using a drug that increases the sensitivity
of both tumor and normal cells to the same extent. Thus, we
investigated if NS-123 radiosensitizes normal tissues in two models.
First, we did an MTS assay using NHA, which represents the
normal cell counterpart of the U251 glioma cell lines. As shown
in Fig. 3A, there was no significant increase in radiosensitization
seen with either 8 or 12 h pretreatment with 5 Amol/L NS-123
compared with DMSO-treated cells.
Effects of NS-123 on embryonic development and survival.
The radiosensitizing effects of NS-123 on human cancer cells, but
not normal cells, prompted us to examine the potential of NS-123

U251 cells were treated with NS-123 for 12 h at the indicated doses (A ) or for the times indicated with 5 Amol/L (B ) before irradiation. Calculated DER at 0.1 survival
are 1.3 for 2.5 Amol/L and 2.0 for 5.0 Amol/L (A ) and 1.2 for 4 h, 1.4 for 8 h, and 1.9 for 12 h pretreatment (B ). C, HT-29 colorectal cancer cells were treated with
DMSO (control) or 5 Amol/L NS-123 for 12 h before IR. DER at 0.5 survival is 3.0. D, A549 lung tumor cells were treated with DMSO (control) or 5 Amol/L NS-123 for
12 h before IR. DER at 0.1 survival is 1.4. Points, averages of three experiments (n = 3); bars, SE.

1 Amol/L staurosporine (SRS ), a known
radiosensitizer of both normal and tumor
cells, was used as a positive control.

in vivo. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos provide a unique vertebrate model that is ideal for the screening of therapeutic agents
because of their close genetic and physiologic homology to upper
level vertebrates, such as mammals, their rapid embryonic
development, optical clarity, and suitability for investigations
regarding the effects of radiation and radiosensitizers (16, 18).
These features allow the efficient screening of novel drugs and
observation of effects on specific organs without the need for
euthanization and necroscopy. The Zebrafish embryos were
pretreated for 8 h with 5 Amol/L NS-123 before 6 Gy of radiation.
As shown in Fig. 3B and C, NS-123 did not appreciably impede
normal embryonic development or viability. In contrast, staurosporine, a potent radiosensitizer but with effects too general to be
used clinically, greatly diminished the viability and development of
the Zebrafish embryos.
NS-123 radiosensitizes U251 cells transplanted into Zebrafish embryos. Human cancer cells can be transplanted into
Zebrafish embryos through microinjection (19–21). These human
cancer cells will then proliferate, nourished by the nutrients
circulating through the embryos. We transplanted U251 cells
expressing RFP to be distinguished from the background tissues of
the embryos (Fig. 4A, left). The transparency and ex utero
development of the Zebrafish embryos facilitate the tracking
and counting in real time of the transplanted human cells,
again without the need for euthanization and necroscopy (Fig. 4A,
middle and right). The U251 cells were transplanted into the
embryonic yolk sac of 4.5 hpf embryos, treated with NS-123, and
irradiated at 24 hpf. The embryos were subsequently examined for
fluorescence on sequential days after irradiation. As shown in
Fig. 4B, treatment of the embryos with NS-123 alone did not have
any significant effect on the size of the U251 xenografts at 3

or 5 dpf. The U251 cells irradiated in the absence of NS-123
showed some regression at 3 and 5 dpf, whereas markedly
fewer cells irradiated in the presence of NS-123 are survived at
5 dpf. Quantitation of these results using 10 embryos/condition/
experiment and assessing the relative fluorescence showed a
faster decrease in luminescence compared with the irradiatedonly control, indicating the more rapid extinction of fluorescence in the embryo irradiated in the presence of NS-123
(Fig. 4C). These data show the radiosensitizing potential of NS-123
in vivo.
NS-123 is well tolerated in nu/nu (nude) mice. The Zebrafish
results suggest that NS-123 has low toxicity in higher order
vertebrates. To test this hypothesis, we gave 50 mg/kg (i.p.) to nude
mice for 3 consecutive days. Clinical signs of drug toxicity and
lethality were not observed over the following 30 days. As seen in
Fig. 5A, all mice gained weight. Furthermore, both gross and
histopathologic examination did not reveal any evidence suggestive
of NS-123–associated toxicity. With these results, we considered
50 mg/kg NS-123  3 days to be an acceptable treatment regimen
for further investigation to test the radiosensitization of NS-123
in mice.
NS-123 induces in vivo radiosensitization of U251 tumors
implanted in nu/nu (nude) mice. To investigate in a more
sophisticated model the radiosensitization observed by NS-123
in Zebrafish, we did a growth delay assay of U251 tumors
xenografts in nu/nu nude mice. Mice were treated for 3 consecutive days with either NS-123 or DMSO (i.p.) and received either
5 Gy IR or Sham IR 4 h after the second injection. As seen in
Fig. 5B, the mean time to reach RTV = 10 was 10 days in the DMSO
group, 12 days in the NS-123 group, 14 days in the DMSO+IR group,
and 20 days in the NS-123 + IR group, which translates in an

in vivo radiosensitizer enhancement ratio for NS-123 of 2.0. The
results show that NS-123 can significantly increase the IR-induced
tumor growth delay without significant toxicity in vivo. Furthermore, they provide additional support for the use of the novel
Zebrafish xenograft model as a faster and more economical
screening tool for potential in vivo radiosensitizing activity of lead
compounds.
NS-123 inhibits dsDNA break repair and prolongs dsDNA
damage-dependent signaling after radiation. As a first step in
understanding the mechanism of the radiosensitizing activity of
NS-123, we measured the processing of DSBs in U251 cells treated
with 30 Amol/L NS-123 or DMSO (control) using an adaptation of
PFGE. We found that when plated at high density (required to
obtain amount of sufficient protein), a 4-h 30 Amol/L dose of
NS-123 induced comparable radiosensitization as a 12-h 5 Amol/L
dose of preincubation on low density–plated cells (data not
shown). Therefore, we used a 4-h 30 Amol/L NS-123 treatment
for experiments analyzing the effects of NS-123 on DSB repair and
immunoblotting (see below) which require a significant quantity of
cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, the initial number of dsDNA breaks was
not affected by NS-123 (NS-123–treated, 88.5 F 5.3 DSBs/Gbp;
DMSO-treated, 84.8 F 3.8 DSBs/Gbp). However, the processing of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

DSBs in NS-123–treated U251 cells was significantly compromised.
The NS-123–treated U251 cells showed not only slower repair
kinetics but also incomplete repair of DSBs even after 24 h.
Specifically, the DMSO-treated cells show almost complete repair of
DSBs at 24 h (f9% of their initial damage), whereas the NS-123–
treated U251 cells show f25% residual damage compared with
their initial levels.
In response to DNA DSB, inactive ATM protein undergoes
autophosphorylation, including at serine 1981 (P-ATM; refs. 22, 23).
The active ATM protein migrates to the sites of damage and
phosphorylates g-H2AX at serine 139. The levels of g-H2AX
decrease after repair of the DNA damage (24–26), and therefore, g-H2AX can serve as a surrogate quantitative measure of
DSBs (27–30). CHK2 is a protein kinase that targets two critical
effectors operating in distinct branches of the G1 checkpoint: the
Cdc25A phosphatase and the p53 transcription factor, both
of which prevent entry of cells into S phase with damaged DNA
(31). P-ATM phosphorylates CHK2 at threonine 68 (termed
P-CHK2). Both P-CHK2 and g-H2AX increase immediately after
IR and gradually decrease as DSBs become repaired (32, 33). Similar
to ATM, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit
(termed P-DNA-PKcs) can be phosphorylated following DNA DSB

resulting from IR and will also phosphorylate both g-H2AX and
P-CHK2 (34, 35).
We therefore assayed the levels of g-H2AX, P-CHK2, P-ATM,
and P-DNA-PKcs in U251 cells by immunoblotting at various
time points after IR. Cells were treated with DMSO (control) or
30 Amol/L NS-123 for 4 h before IR. Figure 6B shows representative results. In the absence of NS-123, IR caused a significant
increase in g-H2AX, P-CHK2, P-DNA-PKcs, and P-ATM at 15 min,
which decreased and returned to baseline by 6 h. In contrast, in
cells treated with NS-123 at 6 h after IR (a time at which >90% of
DSBs should have been repaired), U251 cells exhibited substantially
higher levels of g-H2AX, P-CHK2, P-DNA-PKcs, and P-ATM,
suggesting that unrepaired DSBs accumulate in the presence NS123. Although the precise target of NS-123 is currently not known,
these results strongly point toward an inhibition of DNA damage
signaling pathway as a potential mechanism for radiosensitization.

Discussion
High-throughput screening (HTS) of small molecule libraries is a
powerful and rapid method for identifying promising chemother-

apeutic candidates. We note that the vast majority of current HTS
screening methods are designed predominantly to search for single
compounds that have antiproliferative or other antitumor properties. However, few clinically used drugs are effective or given as
single agents against malignancies. Because radiotherapy is
prescribed for the majority of solid tumors, often in combination with chemotherapy, there is a critical need for improving
the therapeutic efficacy of such combined modalities. Therefore,
we designed our HTS to specifically identify agents with minimal
or low activity but would substantially increase the effectiveness
of radiation. The identification of NS-123 as such a compound
from only a partial screen of the library offers ‘‘proof of principle’’
for the power of our screening assay. It is conceivable that screens
of much larger chemical libraries would identify numerous
compounds with radiosensitizing properties. We believe that
this approach has the potential, with further refinement and
scale-up processes, to identify a large number of similarly promising candidates.
Other target-dependent screens for radiosensitizers have produced promising results. Hickson et al. identified a specific
inhibitor of the ATM, KU-55933 (36). Zhao et al. identified a small
molecule inhibitor of DNA-PK, LY294002, which they used as a lead
to develop another more specific and more potent inhibitor,

NU7026 (11). Small molecule inhibitors of DNA repair pathways,
such as NS-123, that seem to inhibit the repair of the DNA rather
than the signaling of damage, may lead to the development of a
distinct, but complementary, class of therapeutics; they may also be
important as useful probes for elucidating the mechanisms of
action and function of proteins and pathways.
Our findings that NS-123 significantly enhanced the in vitro
cell killing induced by radiation in three different cell lines,
coupled with the lack of radiosensitization within the two normal
tissue models (NHA and Zebrafish) we used, strongly suggested
that NS-123 may be clinically effective at doses that cause little
or no toxicity. These findings were supported by the finding
that radiotherapy delivered in conjunction with NS-123 resulted
in the greatest control of U251 tumors implanted in Zebrafish
xenografts or in nude mice again without any significant
developmental or toxic effects to the embryos or the animals. To
our knowledge, the Zebrafish xenograft model is the first
demonstration of radioenhancing properties in this vertebrate
model system. Although use of Zebrafish to monitor the potential
normal tissue toxicity of chemotherapeutics and radiation is
rather novel, this model is currently used in several large screening facilities (37, 38). Its value as a relatively inexpensive and
HTS-amenable system is gaining ground. Importantly, the results
obtained with the Zebrafish xenograft model were corroborated by
demonstrating radiosensitization in a mouse xenograft model.
Clearly, NS-123 requires further preclinical testing (especially in
terms of pharmacokinetics and toxicology) before use in humans.
Nevertheless, our results, together with previous studies (16),
support the value of Zebrafish as an intermediate-level screening tool of radiosensitizers. For example, one could envision a
scenario where potential drug candidates resulting from an in vitro
screen could be prioritized for testing in expensive and timeconsuming rodent tumor models based on their tumor cell
radiosensitization versus developmental side effects profile in
Zebrafish.
The classic and emerging agents frequently enhance the effect
of radiation through diverse mechanisms, including modification
of DNA damage, interference with DNA repair processes, cytokinetic cooperation caused by cell cycle redistribution, inhibition of
proliferation, and enhancement of apoptosis (39, 40). Our findings that pretreatment of NS-123 does not induce any significant
change in cell cycle distribution up to 8 h after IR (data not
shown) suggests that it is unlikely that NS-123 radiosensitizes
U251 cells by arresting them at the G2-M interface. Undoubtedly,
one of the most biologically significant consequences of IR is the
induction of DSB. Unrepaired DSBs can lead to cell killing or
chromosomal aberrations (41). Based on our PFGE experiment, we
conclude that NS-123 does not increase the initial damage, which is
similar, with and without NS-123 (Fig. 6A), but decreases
significantly the ability of cells to efficiently process DSBs. These
DSBs are expected to be primarily repaired by nonhomologous
end joining (NHEJ) but the contribution of homologous recombination cannot be excluded (42). However, the presence of residual
DSB, even after 24 h, does suggest a significant inhibition of NHEJ.
These data are further supported by the prolonged phosphorylation
of the surrogate markers of dsDNA damage, P-ATM, P-DNA-PKcs,
g-H2AX, and P-CHK2 (43).
ATM plays a central role in DNA damage checkpoint signal
transduction. g-H2AX phosphorylation is among the earliest
ATM-dependent responses to DSB (25, 44). The number and
resolution of g-H2AX foci over time is an indicator of global DSB

repair and correlates with tumor cell radiosensitivity under
oxic and hypoxic conditions (45). CHK2 is a signal-transducing
kinase, sometimes called an effector kinase, which is activated
mainly by ATM in response to DSB from IR. The role of P-CHK2 is
to amplify the signal in response to DNA damage and thus
maintain genomic integrity (46). DNA-PKcs is not thought to
function in signal transduction damage response pathways but
rather participate in DNA NHEJ, a pathway for DSB repair. There
is extensive redundancy in the functions of activated ATM
and DNA-PKcs, but the precise role of DNA-PKcs in DNA damage
checkpoint signaling is not yet clear. In our study, the levels of gH2AX, P-CHK2, P-ATM, and P-DNA-PKcs increase immediately
after irradiation and, in the absence of NS-123, return to baseline
levels by 6 h. In cells irradiated after a 4-h pretreatment with NS123, the phosphorylation of all these proteins continues to increase
or remains constant 6 h after IR, indicating that the majority of
DSB have not been repaired. These results are temporally
consistent with our PFGE results. An inhibitory effect of NS-123
on one or more components of the dsDNA repair machinery could
delay complete repair of DNA after radiation and, thus, be
responsible for the radiosensitization exhibited by NS-123.
However, further investigation is needed to identify the precise
component of the DNA repair machinery affected by NS-123 and
to understand why this mechanism seems to be selective for tumor
cells.
Whereas NS-123 is a previously uncharacterized compound, we
have noted a degree of structural similarity with bromodeoxyuridine (47). Bromodeoxyuridine substitutes for thymidine, increasing
radiation–induced DNA DSBs (48). More recent studies (49) have
shown that radiation of a single-stranded oligonucleotide brominated at a single site results in up to 20-fold more strand breaks
than for a nonbrominated oligonucleotide. Whereas NS-123 is
unlikely to be incorporated into newly synthesized DNA, it is
tempting to speculate that it may intercalate or embed near the
DNA helix. Upon irradiation, NS-123 may participate in similar
anionic complex formation assays, blocking access of DNA repair
proteins to the damaged site. Further analyses of cellular
localization and potential interaction with free DNA in solution
are required to validate this hypothesis.
In summary, our investigation has yielded a novel and potent
chemical compound, NS-123, as a tumor cell–specific radiosensitizer in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism responsible for
NS-123 radiosensitization seems to involve inhibition of DSB repair.
We have further established the anticancer radiosensitizing effects
and lack of adverse normal tissue and developmental effects of NS123 via a novel Zebrafish-based system that incorporates the many
compelling advantages of this vertebrate. Further preclinical
evaluation of this drug, including evaluation of its chemosensitizing potential (in particular in combination with genotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents) and further elucidation of its molecular
targets, are under way.
