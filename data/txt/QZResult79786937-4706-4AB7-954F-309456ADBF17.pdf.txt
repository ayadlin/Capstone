Abstract
The synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR)
induces apoptosis in a variety of cell lines and has shown
promise as an anticancer agent both in vitro and in vivo. The
clinical dose of 4-HPR, however, is limited by residualassociated toxicities, indicating a need for a less toxic drug.
In this study, we show that 4-hydroxybenzylretinone (4-HBR),
the unhydrolyzable analogue of 4-HPR, is effective in producing
apoptosis in a variety of 4-HPR–sensitive cell lines, including
breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and leukemia cells. We also show
through the use of a pan-caspase inhibitor that this 4-HBR–
induced apoptosis is dependent, at least in part, on caspase
activity. 4-HBR is shown to exhibit binding to the retinoic acid
receptors (RAR) at concentrations necessary to induce cell
death and induces expression of all-trans-retinoic acid–
responsive genes that can be blocked by a RAR pan-antagonist.
However, through the use of this RAR pan-antagonist, 4-HBR–
induced apoptosis and cell death is shown to be independent
of the RAR signaling pathway. To further characterize the
mechanism of action of 4-HBR, expression of the endoplasmic
reticulum stress–induced genes GADD153 and Bcl-2–binding
component 3 was examined. These mRNAs are shown to be
rapidly induced in 4-HBR–treated and 4-HPR–treated breast
cancer cells, and this up-regulation is also shown to be
independent of the RARs. These results suggest that a stressmediated apoptotic cascade is involved in the mechanism of
action of these retinoids. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6270–7]

Introduction
Retinoids, both natural and synthetic, are a class of compounds
with structural similarity to vitamin A. Vitamin A and its
metabolites play essential roles in cellular growth, differentiation,
and vision (1). Retinoids have shown promise as anticancer agents,
exhibiting antitumor effects in a variety of cancer cell types both
in vitro and in vivo (2–4). Although naturally occurring retinoids,
such as all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), are proven inhibitors of
cancer cell growth, the therapeutic use of these compounds is

limited due to their undesirable side effects, including mucocutaneous irritation, hyperlipidemia, bone toxicity, reduced night
vision, and teratogenicity (5). Because of this, a continuing goal
in retinoid drug development has been to find new analogues with
improved therapeutic indices.
N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide ( fenretinide, 4-HPR) is a synthetic amide analogue of atRA that was originally developed and
studied as a chemopreventive agent (6). More recently, 4-HPR was
found to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines, including
breast, prostate, neuroblastoma, and leukemia (2, 7). Clinically,
4-HPR has been shown to reduce local recurrent and contralateral
breast cancer in premenopausal women (8, 9). Although these
results are promising, the clinical dose of 4-HPR is limited by
residual-associated toxicities, most notably the production of night
blindness due to a decrease in serum retinol levels (10).
A new nonhydrolyzable 4-HPR analogue, 4-hydroxybenzylretinone (4-HBR), has been reported (11). Like the parent retinamide,
4-HBR has significant chemotherapeutic activity and has been
shown to reduce the size and number of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–induced mammary tumors in rats (12). 4-HBR, like 4HPR, has been shown to induce apoptosis and cell death in the
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (13). 4-HBR shows an improved
therapeutic profile when compared with 4-HPR. Importantly, 4HBR, unlike 4-HPR, is not hydrolyzed in vivo to liberate atRA,
thus eliminating any residual toxicity that might result from
generation of the vitamin A acid. Further, 4-HBR given to the
animal in an amount that is effective in mammary carcinogenesis
does not reduce circulating blood retinol levels, suggesting that
this new analogue would not cause night blindness and, thus,
could be used safely in the clinic at higher concentrations than
the parent 4-HPR.
The biological effects of atRA are mediated through binding to
the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR; ref. 14). Several authors
have reported that 4-HPR acts, at least in part, through activation
of the RAR, whereas others have reported that 4-HPR acts
independent of the RAR signaling pathway (2, 15–17). Whether
RAR signaling plays a role in 4-HBR action is unknown. Whereas
4-HPR could conceivably activate RAR-mediated gene transcription
by acting either directly as an agonist at the receptor binding site
or indirectly via hydrolysis to atRA, 4-HBR would be expected to act
only directly at the RAR-binding site as it cannot undergo
hydrolysis. Both 4-HPR and its nonhydrolyzable analogue exhibit
much less avid binding to RARs in vitro than does the natural
ligand atRA (12). Whether 4-HBR acts as an agonist at the RARbinding site and whether this plays a role in its ability to induce
apoptosis or tumor cell death remains to be established.

4-HBR Induces GADD153, BBC3, and Apoptosis

Figure 1. 4-HBR causes apoptosis and cell death in a variety of tumor cell lines. MCF-7 (A ), T-47D (B ), LAI-15n (C ), and HL-60 (D ) cells were treated with
vehicle, 4-HBR, or 4-HPR, and the number of live cells (expressed as percentage of vehicle; A–D, top ) and apoptotic cells (expressed as percentage of total cells;
A–D, bottom ) was counted 8, 16, 24, and 48 h later. Fluorescein diacetate staining was used to distinguish between live and dead cells. TUNEL of DNA fragmentation
in intact cells was used as a biochemical marker of apoptosis, and fluorescein-dUDP–labeled cells were counted using fluorescent microscopy and labeled as
apoptotic. As a control for apoptosis, the cell lines were also treated with UV, and all lines exhibited strong TUNEL labeling after 24 h (data not shown). In contrast,
exposure to hydrogen peroxide for only 1 h led to the accumulation of propidium iodide with little to no TUNEL labeling, which is characteristic of necrosis (data not
shown). All data sets are representative of at least two independent experiments. Columns, mean of triplicate samples; bars, SE.

Most knowledge about the mechanism of 4-HPR action stems
from studies focused on the more downstream mediators of the
death signal invoked by 4-HPR, including a dependence on caspase
activity in several cell lines (18–20). Some reports indicate that
4-HPR acts through the production of reactive oxygen species
(21, 22) and/or the induction of the lipid secondary messenger
ceramide (23, 24). Still, others report that 4-HPR regulates the
cellular levels of proapoptotic and/or antiapoptotic genes (25–29).
Whether the downstream signaling pathways for 4-HBR are similar
to those of 4-HPR is unknown.
In the work described herein, 4-HBR is shown to be effective in
inducing apoptosis and cell death in four different cancer cell lines
(MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer, LAI-15n neuroblastoma, and HL60 myeloid leukemia), and the necessity for RAR activation in 4HBR action is studied in detail. The ability of 4-HBR to induce the
expression of atRA-responsive genes is reported, and a high-affinity
antagonist of RA-induced function at all three RAR subtypes (30) is
shown to have no effect on the ability of 4-HBR to induce apoptosis
or cell death. Further, the present work shows that the
proapoptotic genes GADD153 (CHOP) and Bcl-2–binding component 3 (BBC3; PUMA) are rapidly induced by 4-HBR in all four cell
lines and that apoptosis produced by this 4-HPR analogue involves
a caspase-dependent mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. [20-methyl 3H or 11,12-3H]-all-trans-RA ([3H]atRA; 70 or
40.5 Ci/mmol, respectively) and [20-methyl 3H]-9-cis -RA ([3H]9cisRA;
69.4 Ci/mmol) were obtained from New England Nuclear. atRA was
purchased from Spectrum Chemical and Laboratory Products. 4-HPR was a
gift from McNeil Pharmaceuticals. 4-HBR was synthesized as described
previously (11). AGN193109 and LGD1069 were prepared using published
methods (31, 32).
Cell culture. MCF-7, T-47D, and HL-60 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and LAI-15n cells were a gift from Dr.
Biedler (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). MCF-7

and LAI-15n cells were cultured as described previously (13, 33). HL-60 cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
L-glutamine (0.3 g/L), and sodium bicarbonate (1.5 g/L). T-47D cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 containing the same supplements with the addition
of bovine pancreas insulin (0.2 unit/mL).
Live cell number and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays. For time course assays, cells
were plated at 50,000 per well in 12-well plates and assayed at various times
after treatment with vehicle (0.2% ethanol) or retinoid (4-HPR or 4-HBR at
both 10 5 and 10 4.5 mol/L, in ethanol). UV irradiation (120 mJ/cm2) for
two cycles in the Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400 and hydrogen peroxide
(50 mmol/L; 1 h) treatment served as controls for apoptosis and necrosis,
respectively. These conditions were optimized for MCF-7 cells in our
laboratory in a series of control experiments. Before harvesting, cells were
incubated with 10 Ag/mL propidium iodide for 10 min at 37jC to stain
necrotic cells. Floating and adherent cells were collected and centrifuged at
250  g for 5 min at 4jC and resuspended in 1 PBS. Half of the sample
was assayed for total and live cell numbers using fluorescein diacetate
(cleaved in metabolically active cells to liberate a fluorescent product),
whereas the other half was assayed for apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining
(In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as
described previously (13).
For antagonist assays, cells were plated in triplicate at 50,000 per well in
12-well culture plates and treated with vehicle, atRA, 4-HPR, or 4-HBR alone
(in ethanol) or combined with AGN193109 in ethanol for 24 h.
Caspase inhibition experiments involved a 1-h incubation with vehicle
(0.1% DMSO) or 50 Amol/L z-VAD-fmk (Sigma Chemical, Inc.) before dosing
with retinoid. MCF-7, T-47D, and LAI-15n cells were treated with vehicle,
10 4.5 mol/L 4-HPR or 4-HBR, UV irradiation, or hydrogen peroxide. HL-60
cells were treated with vehicle, 10 5 mol/L 4-HPR, 10 4.5 mol/L 4-HBR, UV
irradiation, or hydrogen peroxide. Cells were harvested and assayed for total
and live cell number and apoptosis as was described previously.
Cell growth inhibition assay. Cells were seeded at 10,000 per well (or
50,000 per well; LAI-15n) in 12-well plates and allowed to attach overnight
(except HL-60, which grow in suspension), and wells in triplicate were dosed
with vehicle or varying amounts of atRA, 4-HPR, or 4-HBR alone or
combined with AGN193109 for 8 days (or 5 days; HL-60 and LAI-15n cells).

The medium was changed and fresh vehicle or retinoid was added daily.
Cells were harvested and fluorescein diacetate was used to determine the
number of live cells as described previously (13). Using fluorescent microscopy,
at least 200 cells per sample were counted with a hemacytometer.
Nuclear retinoid receptor binding. The ability of retinoids to compete
with [3H]atRA for binding to individual RAR subtypes and with [3H]9cisRA
for binding to retinoid X receptor (RXR) g was determined using
recombinant receptors in an in vitro ligand-binding assay as described
previously (34, 35). The final concentration of [3H]atRA was 2 or 4 nmol/L
and that of [3H]9cisRA was 10 nmol/L.
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR. Cells were harvested and
suspended in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was collected
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA (1 Ag) was reverse
transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (15 units/
25 AL) and random hexamers (100 pmol/25 AL; Promega) in the presence of
0.4 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 28 units RNasin, and 1 reverse
transcriptase buffer supplied with the enzyme. The LightCycler instrument
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to do real-time quantitative PCR
with the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Values
were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
expression levels. Values were then expressed as fold change from the
vehicle-treated samples. The following primer sets were designed using the
cDNA sequences: hRARh, 5¶-CCAGGACAAATCATCAGGGT-3¶ (upstream)
and 5¶-TGGCAGAGTGAAGGGAAAGT-3¶ (downstream); hCYP26A1, 5¶CCCTTCTTTGGGGAAACCTT-3¶ (upstream) and 5¶-GCCCGCATAATCACCTTCTT-3¶ (downstream); GADD153, 5¶-GCCTTTCTCCTTCGGGACAC-3¶ (upstream) and 5¶-TCTGCTGGTTCTGGCTCCTC-3¶ (downstream);

Results
4-HBR Induces Apoptosis and Cell Death in Human
Breast Cancer, Neuroblastoma, and Myeloid Leukemia
Cell Lines
The ability of 4-HBR to induce cell death was tested in a variety of
cancer cell lines known to be sensitive to 4-HPR, including MCF-7
(36), T-47D (37), LAI-15n,4 and HL-60 (15, 38). In the breast cancer
cell lines, 4-HBR at the highest concentration (10 4.5 mol/L)
resulted in the death of nearly all cells by 48 h (Fig. 1A and B, top).
A 50% reduction in live cell number was detected as early as 8 h in
T-47D cells exposed to 4-HBR, whereas MCF-7 cells responded more
slowly. Cell death was also induced by 4-HBR in the human
neuroblastoma cell line LAI-15n (Fig. 1C, top). An 85% reduction in
live cell number was evident at the 10 4.5 mol/L dose as early as 8 h,
whereas nearly all cells were dead by 48 h at both the 10 5 mol/L
and 10 4.5 mol/L doses of 4-HBR. The human myeloid leukemia cell
line HL-60 was also very sensitive to the highest dose of 4-HBR, with
an 85% reduction in live cell number noted by 16 h (Fig. 1D, top). In
general, 4-HBR was f0.5 log unit less potent than 4-HPR in
producing cell death. In summary, 4-HBR at 10 4.5 mol/L is effective
in inducing the death of cell types that are also sensitive to 4-HPR.
4-HPR induces cell death via induction of apoptosis (7), and
evidence has been presented that 4-HBR also induces apoptosis in
MCF-7 cells (13). In the present study, apoptosis was examined in
three additional cancer cell lines (T-47D, LA1-15n, and HL-60)
exposed to 4-HBR. In all cell lines, an increase in the percentage

of cells exhibiting TUNEL labeling was observed over time at the
10 4.5 mol/L concentration of 4-HBR (Fig. 1A–D, bottom). A small
amount of TUNEL labeling was observed in T-47D breast cancer
cells treated with 4-HBR at 10 4.5 mol/L at 8 h (4%), and this
number increased with time, with 70% of cells showing TUNEL
labeling at 48 h (Fig. 1B, bottom). Similarly, in MCF-7 cells treated
with 4-HBR (10 4.5 mol/L), 2% of cells stained positive for TUNEL
at 16 h, increasing to 16% and 61% of cells at 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig. 1A, bottom). A high percentage of apoptotic cells were
present after exposure of both LAI-15n and HL-60 cells to 4-HBR
at 10 4.5 mol/L, and the number of labeled cells increased with
time (Fig. 1C and D, bottom). Therefore, 4-HBR, like 4-HPR, induces
apoptosis and cell death in breast cancer (MCF-7 and T-47D),
neuroblastoma (LAI-15n), and myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells.
In most of the cell lines tested, a significant number of TUNELpositive cells were observed at the same time that cell death was
increased. However, for the T-47D breast cancer cells, a significant
reduction in cell number occurred before the time that any
appreciable apoptosis could be detected. For example, when T-47D
cells were exposed to 4-HPR at 10 4.5 mol/L for 8 h, an 82%
reduction was noted in live cell number, whereas only 1% of the
total cell population showed TUNEL labeling. Likewise, after
exposure of cells to 4-HBR at 10 4.5 mol/L for 8 h, 50% of the cells
had died, whereas only 4% of the cells were undergoing apoptosis.
This suggests that, although apoptosis may play an important role
in the mechanism whereby 4-HBR and fenretinide lead to cell
death, other pathways may also be involved.

4-HBR–Induced Apoptosis Is Dependent, at Least in
Part, on Caspase Activity
Because the exposure of MCF-7, T-47D, LAI-15n, and HL-60 cells
to 4-HBR caused the cells to undergo apoptosis, the pan-caspase
inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was used to determine the role of caspases in
4-HBR–induced cell death. Cells were pretreated with caspase
inhibitor (or vehicle) for 1 h followed by exposure to the ethanolic

are shown at 24 h of treatment, and T-47D, LAI-15n, and HL-60 cells were
studied at 12, 4, and 8 h, respectively. All cells were exposed to 4-HBR and
4-HPR at 10 4.5 mol/L, except HL-60 cells in which 4-HPR was used at
10 5 mol/L. Data are representative of at least two independent experiments.

vehicle (data not shown), 4-HPR, or 4-HBR. In MCF-7 and T-47D
breast cancer cells, the presence of z-VAD-fmk caused a 79% and
64% reduction in TUNEL labeling after 24 h in 4-HBR–treated cells,
respectively, with similar reductions noted in the 4-HPR treatment
group (Fig. 2). LAI-15n cells showed even greater reductions in
TUNEL labeling in the presence of z-VAD-fmk, with 93% and 79%
reductions, respectively, in the 4-HBR and 4-HPR groups (Fig. 2).
The caspase inhibitor was also effective in inhibiting TUNEL
labeling by 68% in HL-60 cells exposed to 4-HBR and by 36% in 4HPR–treated cells (Fig. 2). Thus, the induction of apoptosis by 4HBR is, at least in large part, caspase mediated. Although the
presence of z-VAD-fmk decreased the amount of TUNEL labeling
after treatment with retinoid in each cell type, there were still a
significant number of cells undergoing apoptosis even in the
presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor (data not shown). Although
this may have represented incomplete caspase inhibition, it might
also be an indication that there was a noncaspase-mediated
component to the cell death.

4-HBR–Induced Apoptosis Is Independent of the RAR
To address whether the RAR pathway contributes to the activity
of 4-HBR and/or its parent 4-HPR in inducing apoptosis in MCF-7,
T-47D, LAI-15n, or HL-60 cells, a series of experiments were
initiated to determine, first, whether these compounds at the
concentrations needed to induce apoptosis could bind to the RAR
in vitro and, second, whether the retinoids were also capable of
inducing RAR-mediated gene transcription in these cells. Using the
information gleaned from these experiments, we determined the
optimal concentration of a RAR a,h,g pan-antagonist that would
block RAR-mediated gene transcription for each individual cell line
(except HL-60 cells for which the changes observed in gene
expression in response to RA were less robust) and then verified
that the antagonist could block atRA-mediated growth inhibition
in all four cell lines. Using this information, we then determined
whether this same concentration of antagonist would block the
induction of apoptosis or cell death by 4-HBR or the parent 4-HPR.
4-HBR exhibits some binding to RARs at concentrations
necessary to induce cell death. The results of competition-binding
experiments showed that both 4-HBR and 4-HPR were weak
competitors for [3H]atRA binding to all three RAR types (4-HBR:
K i, f2.5, 4.6, and 16 Amol/L for RARa, RARh, and RARg,
respectively; Supplementary Fig. S1) but neither showed competition for [3H]9cisRA binding to the RXR (data not shown). As
expected, atRA competed well (K i values in the subnanomolar range)
for binding to all three RAR types. Thus, 4-HBR is a much lower
affinity ligand for the RAR compared with atRA but is capable of
binding to a fraction of receptors when present at concentrations
shown to induce apoptosis and cell death (10 4.5 mol/L). A role for
the RAR in 4-HBR action, therefore, cannot be ruled out solely based
on RAR-binding activity.
4-HBR induces expression of atRA-responsive genes in
cancer cell lines and this activity can be blocked by a RAR
pan-antagonist. Because 4-HBR at high concentrations can bind
to the RAR, the ability of 4-HBR to induce RAR-mediated gene
transcription was examined. Preliminary experiments were done
using atRA to determine optimal times for measuring induction of
selected atRA-responsive genes (RARb, CYP26A1, and/or CYP26B1)
in the three cell lines examined (data not shown). Based on these
results, the ability of 4-HBR to induce these mRNAs was examined
and the ability of a RAR pan-antagonist to prevent this induction
was also studied. AGN193109, a RAR antagonist that binds all three

addition of the RAR pan-antagonist AGN193109 (AGN ). Total RNA was isolated
from cells treated with retinoid alone or combined with the RAR pan-antagonist
at 10 5 mol/L at 4 h in MCF-7 (A ), RAR pan-antagonist at 10 6 mol/L at 4 h in
T-47D (B ), or at 10 5 mol/L at 12 h in LAI-15n cells (C ). mRNA was reverse
transcribed and assayed in triplicate by real-time quantitative PCR. Values are
normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. The concentration of AGN193109
chosen for use in each cell line was determined in a separate set of control
experiments; it is the highest concentration that was shown not to affect the live
cell number when added daily for 5 d (LAI-15n) or 8 days (MCF-7 and T-47D) in
culture compared with cells exposed for the same time period to the vehicle
control (data not shown; see also Fig. 4A ).

the RARa, RARh, and RARg, respectively) but does not bind to the
RXR (Supplementary Fig. S2), was chosen for this study (30). The
exposure of MCF-7 cells to atRA, 4-HBR, or 4-HPR resulted in

CYP26A1 induction at 4 h (Fig. 3A) and this was completely inhibited
by cotreatment with the pan-RAR antagonist (10 5 mol/L). In
T-47D cells, a robust induction of CYP26A1 by atRA and more
modest increases in this mRNA were observed after exposure to 4HBR or 4-HPR at 10 5 and 10 4.5 mol/L, and these changes were
completely blocked by AGN193109 (Fig. 3B). In LAI-15n cells, atRA,
4-HBR, and 4-HPR all increased RARb mRNA, and the increase in
this mRNA was blocked by coadministration of AGN193109
(Fig. 3C). Thus, it is clear that 4-HBR at concentrations used to
induce apoptosis and cell death, like fenretinide, is also active in
inducing RAR-mediated gene transcription. Importantly, this work
also shows that the RAR signaling induced by 4-HBR, even at the
highest concentration of 10 4.5 mol/L, can be blocked by cotreatment with the high-affinity pan-RAR antagonist AGN193109.
Apoptosis and cell death in cells exposed to 4-HBR is
independent of the RAR signaling pathway. We next verified
that the RAR pan-antagonist did not, on its own, inhibit cell growth
but that growth inhibition induced by atRA could be completely
blocked by the antagonist. As shown in Fig. 4A, AGN193109 at
concentrations shown to inhibit RAR-mediated gene transcription
did not disrupt cell growth. Further, in all four cell lines, the
addition of the RAR pan-antagonist was able to prevent the
growth-inhibitory effects of atRA, an event known to be dependent
on RAR signaling (Fig. 4A). Importantly, cells treated with a dose of
4-HBR (10 5 mol/L) that, after 48 h of treatment, was shown
previously to not be fully effective in producing apoptosis or cell
death were largely dead at the end of the 4- to 8-day assay, and this
cell death was not prevented by the addition of AGN193109.
Next, we examined whether the induction of apoptosis by 4-HBR
was impaired in the presence of the AGN193109. The results in
Fig. 4B show that the extent of TUNEL labeling produced by 4-HBR
was unchanged when the RAR pan-antagonist was present, and
similar results were obtained with 4-HPR. Thus, a concentration of

RAR pan-antagonist that blocks atRA-mediated gene expression
does not inhibit the induction of apoptosis by 4-HBR in MCF-7,
T-47D, LAI-15n, or HL-60 cells. Taken together, these results show
that the induction of apoptosis and cell death by 4-HBR and 4-HPR
in these cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D, LAI-15n, and HL-60) is independent of the RAR.

4-HBR Causes a Rapid Increase in GADD153 and BBC3
mRNAs that Is Independent of the RAR
It has been reported previously that 4-HPR causes increased
expression of the proapoptotic gene GADD153 (CHOP; refs. 25, 39)
in hepatoma and neuroblastoma cells and, more recently, BBC3
(PUMA) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (29). It is not known
whether 4-HBR affects the expression of either of these mRNAs nor
is much known about the expression of these genes in response to
fenretinide in other cell types. For this reason, we examined
GADD153 and BBC3 mRNA expression using reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) in atRA, 4-HBR–treated, and 4-HPR–treated MCF-7,
T-47D, LAI-15n, and HL-60 cells. The expression of both GADD153
and BBC3 mRNAs was increased at 12 h in MCF-7 cells exposed
either to 4-HBR (8.2- and 2.6-fold, respectively, at 10 4.5 mol/L) or
4-HPR (22- and 3.6-fold, respectively, at 10 4.5 mol/L; Fig. 5, left).
atRA did not produce any increase in either mRNA. To determine
whether the increase in GADD153 or BBC3 mRNAs required
binding to the RARs, the assay was done in the presence and
absence of AGN193109. The presence of the pan-RAR antagonist
did not decrease either GADD153 or BBC3 mRNA expression in
response to either retinoid, indicating that the increased expression
of these proapoptotic genes is independent of RAR signaling
(Fig. 5, left). Both the GADD153 and BBC3 mRNAs were also
induced by 4-HBR and fenretinide in T-47D (4 h), LAI-15n (12 h),
and HL-60 cells (4 h; data not shown). A time course showed that
the increase in the GADD153 and BBC3 mRNAs was detected as

4-HBR Induces GADD153, BBC3, and Apoptosis

early as 6 h after exposure of MCF-7 cells to either 4-HBR or 4-HPR
and as early as 1 h (GADD153) or 2 h (BBC3) after exposure of
T-47D cells (Fig. 5, right; data not shown). Thus, both 4-HPR and
4-HBR treatment of a variety of tumor cell types increased both
GADD153 and BBC3 mRNAs in a manner that was independent of
binding to the RARs. Furthermore, at least in MCF-7 and T-47D
cells, the increase in these mRNAs occurred before the time that
any significant apoptosis was detected. This suggests that these
gene changes could mediate early events in the mechanism
whereby 4-HBR and 4-HPR induce apoptosis and cell death.

Discussion
In the present report, we show that 4-HBR, like its parent
compound, produces apoptosis and cell death in several cancer cell
types, including breast cancer (MCF-7 and T-47D), neuroblastoma
(LAI-15n), and a myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cell line. 4-HBR
represents a promising new drug in the arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents and has an advantage over the parent 4-HPR
molecule as it cannot be hydrolyzed to atRA (13) and does not alter
blood retinol levels when fed to animals at chemotherapeutic levels
(12). Although clinical trials of fenretinide in breast cancer and
chemoprevention of recurrence in head and neck cancers have
shown some promise (9, 40), the overall results are not as dramatic
as would be predicted from cell culture and animal studies.
Although plasma fenretinide levels of 1 Amol/L were achieved in
humans treated orally at 200 mg/d (10), it is possible that the blood
and tissue levels of the retinamide were still below optimal to
produce greater positive clinical effects. In cell culture studies,
doses of 4-HPR of 10 Amol/L are often needed to produce
significant apoptosis and cell death. The major clinical doselimiting side effect of fenretinide is night blindness that results
from a decrease in circulating retinol levels. Thus, it may be
possible to overcome the dose-limiting effects of fenretinide with
higher doses of the novel unhydrolyzable nontoxic 4-HBR analogue.
The chemotherapeutic effect of the 4-HPR molecule has been
proposed to occur via a mechanism independent of RAR activity
based on its ability to inhibit the growth of atRA-resistant cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

(15, 17). However, other studies have suggested a role for the RAR in
mediating growth inhibition by 4-HPR (41, 42). 4-HPR has been
shown to undergo limited hydrolysis to atRA when fed to vitamin
A–deficient rats (13), suggesting a means whereby 4-HPR might act
as a prodrug to liberate the RAR activator atRA. However, others
have reported that atRA could not be detected in 4-HPR–treated
MCF-7 cells (17), suggesting that, unlike in the whole animal, little
atRA is liberated from this retinamide in cell culture. In the present
study, we show that the unhydrolyzable 4-HBR analogue can, at high
concentrations, compete with [3H]atRA for binding to all three RAR
subtypes. Furthermore, we find that 4-HBR regulates endogenous
RAR-mediated gene expression using the native complement of
receptors present in two human mammary cancer lines and in a
neuroblastoma cell line. Thus, 4-HBR, like fenretinide, is capable of
stimulating RAR-mediated gene expression in these cell lines.
To determine whether RAR binding plays any role in the
apoptosis or cell death that occurs in cells exposed to 4-HBR, a
RAR pan-antagonist was used to block RAR binding and
downstream signaling. Using a concentration of antagonist that
effectively blocks all atRA-inducible gene expression, we show that
the induction of apoptosis by 4-HBR is unaltered. A different RAR
pan-antagonist (BMS-204701) was also reported to be ineffective in
inhibiting 4-HPR–induced apoptosis in human embryonal carcinoma cells (16). In a study of a different human neuroblastoma cell
line (SH-SY5Y), several RAR antagonists were unable to block the
4-HPR induction of Bak, a proapoptotic Bcl-2–related gene (26).
However, in contrast to our findings, this group also reported that a
RARh/RARg antagonist could inhibit apoptosis (43). Thus, the
ability of 4-HPR and 4-HBR to induce apoptosis, at least in MCF-7,
T-47D, LAI-15n, and HL-60 cells, does not seem to be dependent on
the RARs. This agrees with studies in many cell systems indicating
that apoptosis in response to 4-HPR seems to be predominantly
RAR independent (2, 7).
The present study shows that both 4-HBR and the parent 4-HPR
induce apoptosis and cell death that is dependent, at least in part,
on caspase activity. The initial evidence for the involvement of
caspases in 4-HPR action included the activation of the effector
caspase-3 and resultant cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase

(18, 43). A role for caspase-8 and caspase-9 in 4-HPR action has also
been reported (19, 20). In human neuroblastoma and MCF-7 cells,
pan-caspase inhibitors (BOC-d-fmk and z-VAD-fmk, respectively)
were shown to significantly reduce apoptosis after 4-HPR treatment (24, 44). In Fas-defective hepatoma cells, the general caspase
inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely blocked apoptosis in response to
4-HPR (20). Thus, consistent with previous findings for fenretinide,
4-HBR acts, at least in part, via a caspase-dependent mechanism.
Our results show that the proapoptotic molecule GADD153 is
very rapidly up-regulated by 4-HBR and 4-HPR in breast cancer
cells, suggesting that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress could be
an important event initiating apoptosis by both of these retinoids.
ER stress has recently been implicated in 4-HPR–mediated
apoptosis in glioma cells (45). GADD153 has also been reported
to be increased in response to 4-HPR treatment in both SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma and Hep3B hepatoma cells (25, 26, 39) and more
recently was reported to be induced by 4-HPR in a microarray
analysis of T-47D cells treated for 24 or 48 h (46). The present study
shows that GADD153 mRNA is very rapidly induced in breast
cancer cells (within 1 to 6 h) exposed to 4-HBR or fenretinide.
Whether this induction of GADD153 is due to a signal emanating
from the ER or results from a pathway distinct from that of the ER
stress signaling cascade (47) remains to be established.
Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are also key regulators of
apoptotic pathways, and they are influenced by ER stress and,
conversely, can regulate both mitochondrial-mediated and ER
stress–induced apoptosis (48). The BH3-only, proapoptotic Bcl-2
family member protein BBC3, also known as PUMA, was first
identified as a Bcl-2–binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen
and as a p53-inducible gene by differential expression analysis
(49, 50). More recently, BBC3 has been implicated as an important
mediator of ER stress–induced apoptosis (51). In 2005, Wei et al.
reported early induction of BBC3 mRNA and protein levels in
4-HPR–treated SH-SY5Y cells. RT-PCR analysis of BBC3 mRNA

levels in our studies reveals both a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of BBC3 mRNA in breast cancer cells, neuroblastoma,
and human myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, in breast cancer
cells, 4-HPR treatment has also been reported to result in a
decrease in the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 mRNA (28). Thus, an increase in
proapoptotic and a decrease in antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members
could contribute to 4-HBR–induced and fenretinide-induced
apoptosis, at least in some cell types. We also report that the upregulation of both GADD153 and BBC3 by 4-HBR and 4-HPR is
independent of RAR signaling. Thus, these results suggest that
changes in GADD153 and BBC3 could play an important role in
both 4-HPR– and 4-HBR–induced apoptosis and suggest that an ER
stress–mediated apoptotic cascade is involved in the mechanism of
action of these drugs.
In summary, we have shown that the unhydrolyzable 4-HPR
analogue, 4-HBR, induces apoptosis and cell death in a caspasedependent fashion in several different cell lines, including breast,
neuroblastoma, and leukemia. 4-HBR as well as the parent
fenretinide rapidly induce the expression of both GADD153 and
BBC3 mRNAs. The induction of these mRNAs by 4-HBR and
fenretinide is not altered by the presence of a RAR a,h,g antagonist
nor is the induction of apoptosis in these cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D,
LAI-15n, and HL-60) dependent on the RAR. Future experiments
will be aimed at identifying key events that lie upstream of this
stress response and apoptotic cascade to further elucidate the
mechanism of 4-HBR action.
