Abstract
Tumor microenvironments present significant barriers to penetration by antibodies, immunoconjugates,
and other immunotoxins. In this report, we illustrate a novel strategy to increase tumor cell uptake of immunotoxin by combination with Taxol. SS1P is an immunotoxin composed of the Fv portion of a mesothelinspecific antibody fused to a bacterial toxin that is presently undergoing phase II testing in mesothelioma.
Using novel flow cytometry and gel filtration methods, we quantified SS1P uptake in individual tumor cells
along with levels of shed mesothelin (sMSLN), a barrier of SS1P therapy. The validity of our flow cytometric
method was confirmed by the ability to similarly quantitate tumor cell uptake of Herceptin and an immunotoxin targeting HER2/neu. SS1P uptake peaked several hours after SS1P was cleared from the blood, reflecting
an intratumor distribution process of SS1P that is independent of blood supply. Using the methods developed,
we demonstrated that Taxol could improve SS1P penetration into tumors in parallel with an associated reduction of sMSLN in tumor extracellular fluid. Our findings offer a mechanistic rationale to combine SS1P with
Taxol or another cytotoxic drug as a strategy to increase immunotoxin uptake by tumor cells. Further, we
suggest one basis to understand why chemotherapy and antibody-based therapies cooperate when combined
in cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1082–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Solid tumors remain a major therapeutic problem despite
the large number of treatments available. Antibody-based
therapies have shown great promise, but a major challenge
is delivering sufficient amounts of antibody, immunoconjugate, or immunotoxin to all malignant cells within large tumor masses. To kill cells, these agents must be distributed
to the tumor by blood vessels, escape from capillaries, and
diffuse through the interstitial space to reach cells in the interior of the tumor. Several barriers to antibody penetration
have been identified, including defective vasculature (1), a
binding site barrier (2), high interstitial fluid pressure (3),
high collagen composition (4), and the presence of high levels
of shed antigen in the tumor (5).
Recombinant immunotoxins are genetically engineered
proteins composed of the Fv portion of an antibody fused
to a toxic protein designed to kill cancer cells (6). Two of
these, Ontak (7) and BL22 (8), are very active in hematologic
malignancies; however, immunotoxins are less active against
solid tumors (9, 10).

Immunotoxin SS1P, currently in a phase II clinical trial, targets solid tumors with mesothelin expression. It is a 63,000
daltons protein with a half-life of 20 minutes in mice. The large
molecular size, short half-life, and systemic toxicity limit its
entry to tumor tissue. In addition, mesothelin is actively shed
by tumors. Shed mesothelin (sMSLN) is present in tumor extracellular fluid (ECF) at a very high concentration and acts
as a decoy receptor to prevent SS1P from targeting tumor
cells (5). These factors make enhancing drug delivery into
tumors critical to improve the therapeutic effect of SS1P.
In this study, we describe a new approach to study the targeting process of SS1P in tumors. Because only internalized SS1P
can kill cancer cells, we developed a flow cytometry–based
method (FC method) to measure both the percentage of cells
in a tumor that accumulates SS1P and the average amount of
SS1P internalized by these cells. A gel filtration assay was also
developed to study the formation of SS1P/mesothelin complexes in tumor ECF. This approach showed that Taxol treatment improved SS1P penetration into tumors and increased
the fraction of tumor cells that accumulate SS1P. We conclude
that this effect of Taxol contributes to the remarkable synergy
obtained when the two agents are used together. We also
showed this new method can be used to study the uptake of
Herceptin and an immunotoxin targeting HER2/neu.

Materials and Methods

cells and mouse macrophages.

Control mice received saline (a). Mice
bearing A431/H9 tumors received
SS1P-Alexa488 of different doses:
4 μg (b), 20 μg (c), and 100 μg (d). After
3 h, the staining of SS1P-Alexa on

and 650 mm3) received 20 μg of
SS1P-Alexa. Tumor cell staining after

an ADP-ribosylating mutant of SS1P, in which glutamic acid
553 of Pseudomonas exotoxin A was substituted by aspartic
acid. It is a nontoxic form of SS1P, retaining full binding capacity (12). The Alexa labeling was done with Alexa Fluor
Protein Labeling Kit (Invitrogen). SS1P was biotinylated with
Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation (Pierce). Rat anti-mouse CD16/32
and phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) are from BD.
Cell culture. A431/H9 is a human mesothelin transfected
A431 cell line. There are 5 × 106 mesothelin molecules for
binding on the surface of each A431/H9 cell. NIH-3T3/HER2 is a gift from Dr. Peter L. Choyke (NIH, Bethesda, MD;
ref. 13). It is a human HER-2–transfected NIH-3T3 cell line,
with high HER-2 expression on the cell surface. KB and A431/
H9 cells are grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). NIH-3T3/HER-2 is maintained in RPMI 1640 (10% FBS).
Tumor dissociation and cell labeling analysis. Alexalabeled immunotoxin or antibody was given i.v. in 200 μL of
0.9% NaCl with 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. Xenografted
A431/H9 tumors were removed and minced. Tumor dissociation was performed with 0.2 units/mL Liberase III (Roche) and
0.1 mg/mL DNase I in Hank's buffered salt solution. The incubation was at 37°C for 30 min of constant mixing. The cell suspension was passed through a cell strainer (50 μm). A431/H9
cells were identified by staining with PE-labeled anti-human
EGFR. Rat anti-mouse CD16/32 (10 μg/mL) was used to block
nonspecific binding to Fc receptor. When antibody was injected, tumor perfusion was performed to remove circulating
antibody in the blood before tumor was harvested (14).

The number of incorporated SS1P molecules. One A431/
H9 cell has 5 × 106 sites for SS1P-Alexa binding. A fluorescence
intensity after saturation by SS1P-Alexa of culture cells was
used as a standard. In tumor experiments, mice received an injection of SS1P-Alexa. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
was measured for EGFR-positive cell population in tumor
cell suspension. The MFI was compared with that of mice that
received only saline treatment. The average number of cellassociated SS1P-Alexa was then calculated. Because surface
SS1P-Alexa was completely removed during tumor digestion,
the number actually represented internalized SS1P-Alexa molecules by A431/H9 tumor cells.
Tumor experiments. Tumor experiments were done as
previously described (11). NIH-3T3/HER-2 (2.0 × 106 cells)
were used for implantation. The animal protocol was approved by the National Cancer Institute Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Mesothelin preparation. Mesothelin was expressed and
purified as a rabbit Fc fusion protein with a His tag (15).
The fusion protein has a thrombin cleavage site between
the rabbit IgG and the extracellular domain of mesothelin.
After purification of Fc-mesothelin over Protein A Sepharose (Amersham), Fc-mesothelin was dialyzed against immobilized affinity chromatography A buffer [50 mmol/L
NaPO 4 H 2 , 10 mmol/L imidazole, 500 mmol/L NaCl
(pH 7.5)] in the presence of thrombin (200 units; GE
Healthcare) at room temperature overnight. The cleaved
mesothelin product was then purified from the remaining
Fc protein by immobilized affinity chromatography on Ni

2 mL column.
ELISA assay for SS1P-biotin. The concentration of SS1Pbiotin was measured by ELISA. Briefly, microtiter plates were
coated with 4 μg/mL goat anti-mouse IgG. After blocking,
mouse anti-PE monoclonal antibody IP57 (4 μg/mL) was
added for incubation. After four washes, SS1P-biotin samples
with proteinase inhibitor cocktail III (Calbiochem) was
added and incubated overnight at 4°C, followed by 45-min
incubation with streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase
(100 ng/mL). The color was developed by tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Pierce). The assay can detect SS1P-biotin
concentration as low as 0.1 ng/mL.
The characterization of SS1P and mesothelin in tumor
ECF. Tumor ECF was obtained by nylon mesh basket method
as previously described (16). To analyze the formation of
SS1P/mesothelin complex in tumor ECF, gel filtration studies
were performed with a TSK G2000sw column (30 cm ×
7.8 mm; TOSOH). Briefly, 100 μL of isolated ECF (diluted
1:10 in PBS) was loaded onto column. PBS was applied to
the column at the flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Fractions of 0.2
mL were collected. SS1P and mesothelin concentrations in
each fraction were measured by ELISA.
Statistics. All data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical
differences between groups were measured by Student's
t test with two-tailed distribution. A P value of less than
0.05 was considered significant.

Results
FC method for in vivo mesothelin targeting. To measure
SS1P uptake by cells in a tumor, we developed the FC method, which we designed to measure the percentage of tumor
cells that accumulate SS1P in vivo. SS1P was labeled by a

small and stable fluorophore, Alexa488. The resulting conjugate, SS1P-Alexa488, has the same activity in cell killing
assays and antitumor activity in mice as SS1P. It is also very
stable after uptake by tumor cells with a half-life of 40 hours
(data not shown).
SS1P-Alexa488 was given i.v. to mice bearing A431/H9 tumors (150 mm3). Tumors were removed 3 hours later, and a
single-cell suspension was prepared as described in Materials
and Methods. The fluorescent signal of SS1P-Alexa488 on
these cells was measured by flow cytometry. A431/H9 cells
express a high level of mesothelin and EGFR on their cell surface. EGFR is used to identify and gate tumor cells because of
its resistance to enzymatic digestion (Fig. 1A). Several different types of cells within the tumor were identified, including
tumor cells (50%), macrophages (30%), endothelial cells (2%),
and others.
The EGFR-positive tumor cell population was gated for the
analysis of SS1P staining. Because the digesting enzymes
completely removed surface-bound SS1P, this method specifically measured internalized SS1P. When 4 μg of SS1PAlexa488 was given, 9.4% of tumor cells became SS1P
positive. When 20 and 100 μg were given, the positive tumor
cells increased to 36% and 93%. There is only a 0.6% background in the assay (Fig. 1B). Thus, the fraction of positive
tumor cells is positively correlated with the dose of SS1PAlexa488 (Fig. 1C).
In addition, we injected 20 μg of Alexa488-labeled immunotoxin BL22 that binds to human CD22, which is not
expressed on A431/H9 cells (17). We also injected SS1PAlexa488 (20 μg) into mice bearing A431 tumors that do
not express mesothelin. No Alexa-positive tumor cells were
detected in these experiments (data not shown). These
results show that SS1P-Alexa488 uptake by A431/H9 cells
is specifically mediated by mesothelin binding.

anti–HER-2 antibody (Herceptin) and
immunotoxin (Erb38). Mice with NIH-3T3/HER2
tumors (∼200 mm3) received either Herceptin
(30 μg; A) or Erb38 (B). Tumor cells were defined
as the CD45−/CD31− population. The
staining was measured 24 h after Herceptin
administration and 3 h after Erb38.

Improved Delivery of SS1P with Decreased Mesothelin Levels

Figure 3. In vivo time course for
internalized SS1P in tumor cells.
SS1P (E553D)-Alexa (20 μg) was
given to mice bearing A431/H9
tumors. Tumors were removed at
different time points: 15 min
and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 16 h (n = 3).
The staining of tumor cells by SS1P
(E553D)-Alexa was analyzed.
The percentage of SS1P(E553D)Alexa–positive tumor cells was
shown in A. The number of SS1PAlexa molecules incorporated into
tumor cells was shown in B.
A representative result from each
time point was shown in C. The
number at the top right corner
of each time point denotes the
percentage of SS1P(E553D)Alexa–positive tumor cells. The
number in the left above the
middle line is the MFI of tumor cell
population.

The effect of tumor size on SS1P uptake was evaluated by
injecting 20 μg of SS1P-Alexa into mice with different size
tumors. Figure 1D shows that the percentage of cells labeled
at 3 hours is inversely related to tumor size with the highest
uptake (48%) for the smallest tumor (75 mm3). The values
decreased to 31% for 170 mm3 tumors, to 22% for 400 mm3
tumors, and to 10% for 650 mm3. Tumor cell staining in vivo
by SS1P-Alexa is strongly dependent on tumor size.
FC method for in vivo HER-2 targeting. We also applied
the FC method to study the in vivo targeting process of Herceptin, a humanized antibody targeting HER2/neu–expressing tumors. We labeled it with Alexa647, which is
structurally similar to Alexa488 but brighter. At a dose of
30 μg, 24% of NIH-3T3/HER2 tumor cells became positive
for Herceptin. Rituxan-Alexa647 was used as a negative control, and only 0.6% positive tumor cells were observed
(Fig. 2A). We also applied the FC method to the antiHER2/neu immunotoxin Erb38 (18); 33% of tumor cells were
labeled at 20 μg of Erb38-Alexa647 and 98% at 100 μg. Only
1.5% of cells were labeled with immunotoxin HA22 targeting
CD22 (Fig. 2B). These studies show that the FC method can
have a wide range of applications in the study of antibodybased therapies.
The kinetics of cellular uptake of SS1P in tumor. The
tumor digestion step in this FC method completely removes
surface-bound SS1P and measures only internalized SS1P. To
examine the kinetics of cellular accumulation of SS1P in tumors independent of tumor cell killing, we used an inactive
SS1P mutant SS1P(E553D)-Alexa. A 20 μg dose was given to
mice with 150 mm3 tumors. Figure 3A shows that the percentage of SS1P-Alexa–positive cells increases with time,
peaking at 60% between 6 and 9 hours. The uptake decreased
to 30% at 16 hours, which reflects a combination of degradation and dilution by cell division.
The FC method allows one to calculate the average
amount of SS1P taken up per cell by using the MFI and converting it to the number of molecules per cell (see Materials

www.aacrjournals.org

and Methods). Figure 3B shows that at 1 hour, when 20% of
cells contain SS1P, there are 37,000 SS1P molecules per cell,
and this increases to 110,000 molecules per cell at 6 hours
(P < 0.01), when 60% of cells contain SS1P. Between 6 and
9 hours, there is a further increase. Representative SS1P
staining of tumor cells at each time point is shown in
Fig. 3C. These studies show that the FC method has an advantage over other methods because it quantifies the amount
of study drug targeting tumor cells on a cellular basis.
Synergy of Taxol and immunotoxin SS1P on mesothelinexpressing tumors. We previously showed that Taxol and
SS1P synergize to cause the regression or eradication of mesothelin-expressing A431/K5 and KB tumors (11, 16). Taxol
was shown to significantly decrease the sMSLN level in
tumor ECF, which constitutes a barrier for SS1P therapy.
Similar results were also identified with the tumor model
used in the current study. When one dose of Taxol or three
doses of SS1P alone delayed tumor growth for ∼5 days, combination therapy caused dramatic regressions on tumor
growth with a nadir on day 15 (Fig. 4A). Taxol treatment
reduced the sMSLN levels in both tumor ECF and serum
∼3-fold (Fig. 4Ba and b).
We investigated whether reducing the sMSLN barrier by
Taxol was associated with an improvement of cellular uptake
of SS1P in tumors with the FC method. Mice with tumors
received SS1P-Alexa alone or SS1P-Alexa proceeded by Taxol
(Fig. 4C). Without Taxol, 35% of the tumor cells are positive
for SS1P at 3 hours. The percentage increased to 43% 3 days
after one dose of 20 mg/kg Taxol (P < 0.05) and to 57% after
50 mg/kg Taxol (P < 0.01). Taxol did not increase the cell surface expression of mesothelin (data not shown). We conclude
that the increased cellular uptake of SS1P after Taxol administration results from improved SS1P penetration in tumor.
Formation of SS1P/mesothelin complexes in tumor
extracellular space. To provide direct evidence that sMSLN
can act as a barrier in tumors, we developed a gel filtration
method to determine if SS1P in tumors was free or bound to

complex with sMSLN. Figure 5A shows that the TSK column
can resolve mesothelin, SS1P, and the complex. As standards,
SS1P alone, purified mesothelin alone, and preformed SS1P/
mesothelin complexes were each run over the column. The
SS1P peak emerged at 7.8 mL, corresponding to 61 kDa.
Mesothelin eluted at 7.2 mL, corresponding to an apparent
MW of 73 kDa. Although this is much larger than the expected MW of 42 kDa (19), analysis by dynamic light scattering shows that mesothelin is a monomer (data not shown)
and behaves aberrantly on the column. The mesothelin-

Improved Delivery of SS1P with Decreased Mesothelin Levels

Figure 6. Formation of SS1P/mesothelin
complex in tumor. A, injected SS1P (blue) is
transported into the tumor tissue. It distributes
between tumor cells and tumor extracellular
space. Excess SS1P in tumor ECF penetrates to
reach more tumor cells. At the same time, it
forms a complex (green) with sMSLN (light
brown) over that area. Tumor periphery
has the highest SS1P concentration because of
rich vasculature, and tumor center has the
lowest SS1P concentration. B, when Taxol is
given, sMSLN level in tumor ECF is lowered.
More excess SS1P in ECF is available for
penetration. A larger fraction of tumor cells are
stained by SS1P.

(Fig. 5C). This is the expected result because the concentration of free mesothelin greatly exceeds that of SS1P in the
tumor extracellular space. We showed that the complex peak
is SS1P mediated by using HA22 as a negative control. ECF
from HA22-biotin–treated tumors has only one peak at the
position of free SS1P (Fig. 5D). This study provides direct
evidence that sMSLN in tumor ECF binds mesothelin, which
can serve as a barrier to SS1P therapy.

Discussion
We have developed a new flow cytometry–based approach to study the targeting process of immunotoxins
and antibodies within solid tumors. In this approach, the
immunotoxin or antibody labeled with a fluorescent dye is
injected into mice bearing solid tumors. After various time
periods, the tumor is removed, separated into single tumor
cells, and their content of immunotoxin was analyzed by
flow cytometry. We initially applied this method to study
the uptake of the SS1P immunotoxin targeting mesothelin,
but subsequently have shown that the method works for
both the Herceptin antibody and an immunotoxin targeting Her2/neu.
We also studied the formation of SS1P/sMSLN complexes in
the tumor ECF by gel filtration chromatography. We then used
these methods to examine the mechanism of synergy observed
when mesothelin-expressing tumors are treated with Taxol
and SS1P. We showed that prior Taxol treatment increases
the percentage of tumor cells that accumulate SS1P and propose that this effect accounts for the synergy observed when
the agents are used together.
Because solid tumors have no lymphatics, there is a major
defect in perfusion and drugs can only enter by diffusion, a
much slower process. In addition, the high interstitial fluid
pressure in tumors further impairs drug entry and this is especially important for antibody-based drugs, which diffuse
slowly because of their large size (20). Drug is also consumed
by binding to ligands along the path of entry. Because immunotoxins have a relatively short life in the circulation

www.aacrjournals.org

(20 minutes in mice and 2–8 hours in humans), and because
they cannot be given at very high doses due to nonspecific
side effects, the time that the tumor is exposed to high immunotoxin concentrations is relatively short. Hence, improving penetration should have an important impact on their
therapeutic effect.
FC method for in vivo targeting. Previously, uptake of
antibodies and immunotoxins by tumors has been investigated
using radiolabeling or by immunohistochemistry—methods
that are difficult to quantify at a cellular level. In this study,
we used Alexa-labeled immunotoxin. The Alexa molecules used
are small (less than 1 kDa), stable across a broad pH range, and
emit a strong fluorescent signal upon excitation. These properties make these fluorochromes ideal for tumor staining studies and enabled us to measure both the percentage of cells in
the tumor taking up the immunotoxin and the amount taken
up by single cells.
One feature of the method is that an enzymatic digestion
step is used to dissociate tumor cells. This treatment completely removes mesothelin and SS1P bound to it from
the cell surface and allowed us to quantify the number of
molecules internalized, which are critical for immunotoxin
activity. Other methods measure both bound and internalized molecules as well as molecules trapped in the ECF or
by other cell types. In addition, when multicolor staining is
used, cell populations, other than tumor cells, can be simultaneously studied for their contributions to the drug
distribution.
Gel filtration study. Mesothelin is actively shed from the
cell surface so that sMSLN exists in tumor ECF at high concentrations (16), where it should be able to form complexes
with SS1P, preventing it from binding to tumor cells or diffusing further into the tumor. In this study, we analyzed the
nature of SS1P in the tumor ECF by size exclusion chromatography and showed that it was present in complexes with
mesothelin. The complex is a result of SS1P distribution between cellular components of tumor and ECF. Several factors
affects its formation in the tumor, including the level of SS1P
in the tumor, the time and distance SS1P penetrates, and

the sMSLN level in ECF. Thus, the level of complex is closely
associated with the SS1P targeting process.
SS1P redistribution in tumor. In mice, the half-life of
SS1P in the circulation is ∼20 minutes, so that after 2 hours
the immunotoxin is essentially gone from the circulation and
not available for tumor uptake. We were surprised to find
that tumor cell labeling increased for up to 6 hours. There
is a clear discrepancy between the kinetics of SS1P in blood
and tumor cell uptake. This finding indicates that significant
amounts of the immunotoxin are being redistributed within
the tumor after blood levels have decreased to insignificant
levels. Because the immunotoxin we measure is within the
cell, some of the increase observed at 6 hours could have
been due to SS1P on the cell surface, which is subsequently internalized. To investigate this, we measured the rate of internalization of surface-bound SS1P into A431/H9 cells in vitro
and found that the internalization is complete within 1 hour
(data not shown). We think it is unlikely that internalization
is much slower in vivo. Our data suggest that there may be a
reservoir of SS1P in the tumor that supplies SS1P to the tumor
cells for several hours after SS1P in the blood has been cleared.
This is in accord with the model of Jain and colleagues who
predicted that under some circumstances a “drug reservoir”
is present in the tumor that allows drug to spread within the
tumor independent of blood supply (21).
Contribution of attenuated sMSLN barrier to Taxol and
SS1P synergy. Based on the results from the FC method and
gel filtration study, we show in Fig. 6 how reduction of the
sMSLN level in ECF and reduction of the site density barrier
after Taxol treatment contributes to the improved antitumor
effect (Fig. 6). The injection of 20 μg of SS1P gives a blood level
of ∼20 μg/mL. SS1P immediately enters the tumor because of
the large concentration gradient. Entry continues for 1 to 2
hours until the blood concentration decreases to insignificant
levels (0.5 μg/mL). During this period, SS1P molecules move
out of the capillary and into the tumor compartment where
they initially bind to tumor cells closest to blood vessels. As
SS1P molecules penetrate further, they reach more tumor
cells. Along the path, they bind to sMSLN in tumor ECF, forming complexes. Because of the very large amounts of sMSLN in
the ECF, the distance SS1P can penetrate is limited. ECF complex formation is a function of sMSLN levels and penetration
distance. After Taxol treatment, sMSLN is decreased, allowing
SS1P to reach more tumor cells.
Overcome barriers by Taxol. Increasing the SS1P dose to
100 μg overcame the barriers to entry so that more than 90%
of the cells were labeled by 3 hours. Unfortunately, due to

nonspecific liver damage, the maximum single dose of SS1P
that can be safely given to a mouse is ∼20 μg. One way to
increase the number of cells that can be reached by SS1P is
to pretreat animals with Taxol. Taxol has several useful effects. One is to lower sMSLN levels, removing the decoy barrier (16); a second is to disrupt the close packing of tumor
cells, reducing the site barrier (2); and a third is to lower interstitial pressure, which allows for more rapid entry of
macromolecules like SS1P (3, 22). One reason for the decrease
in mesothelin levels is cessation of production due to tumor
cell death. A second is more rapid transfer from the tumor
into the blood due to disruption of the tumor. This is consistent with the suggestion that the void space produced by cancer cell death enhances the spreading of oncolytic herpes
simplex virus (23). Thus, Taxol treatment could be creating
an environment that facilitates the diffusion of sMSLN.
Implications for human studies. We conducted this study
to determine how to increase immunotoxin activity in solid
tumors in humans. Based on our preclinical studies demonstrating increased antitumor activity of immunotoxins when
given with chemotherapy, a phase II trial of SS1P in patients
with mesothelioma has opened. In this trial, patients with
pleural mesothelioma are treated with chemotherapy (cisplatin
and pemetrexed) followed by immunotoxin SS1P. We have measured mesothelin expression (24), the sensitivity of mesothelioma cells from patients to SS1P (25), and the soluble mesothelin
levels in several human mesotheliomas1; all these values are
similar to the values we found in KB cells or KB tumors. Because
KB tumors are effectively treated with a combination of chemotherapy and SS1P, we believe that our combinational approach
will be of value in some of these patients.
