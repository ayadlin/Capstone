Abstract
The genotoxin cisplatin is commonly used in chemotherapy to treat solid tumors, yet our understanding of
the mechanism underlying the drug response is limited. In a focused siRNA screen, using an siRNA library
targeting genes involved in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like signaling, we identiﬁed the E3 ubiquitin ligase HOIP as a
key regulator of cisplatin-induced genotoxicity. HOIP forms, with SHARPIN and HOIL-1L, the linear ubiquitin
assembly complex (LUBAC). We show that cells deﬁcient in the HOIP ligase complex exhibit hypersensitivity
to cisplatin. This is due to a dramatic increase in caspase-8/caspase-3–mediated apoptosis that is strictly
dependent on ATM-, but not ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint activation. Moreover, basal and cisplatininduced activity of the stress response kinase JNK is enhanced in HOIP-depleted cells and, conversely, JNK
inhibition can increase cellular resistance to cisplatin and reverse the apoptotic hyperactivation in HOIP-depleted
cells. Furthermore, we show that HOIP depletion sensitizes cancer cells, derived from carcinomas of various
origins, through an enhanced apoptotic cell death response. We also provide evidence that ovarian cancer cells
classiﬁed as cisplatin-resistant can regain sensitivity following HOIP downregulation. Cumulatively, our study
identiﬁes a HOIP-regulated antiapoptotic signaling pathway, and we envisage HOIP as a potential target for the
development of combinatorial chemotherapies to potentiate the efﬁcacy of platinum-based anticancer drugs.

Introduction
Platinum-based agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin are
commonly used in chemotherapy. They display therapeutic
activity against a wide variety of solid tumors such as testicular,
ovarian, and non–small cell lung cancers (1). Cisplatin is a
potent genotoxin that initially interferes with proliferation of
the tumor cell (antiproliferative activity) but ultimately
induces apoptosis in the tumor cell (cytotoxic activity). Despite
the successful application of this drug over the last 30 years,
side effects, in particular myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity,
and neurotoxicity, remain the limiting factors for its therapeutic efﬁcacy. Furthermore, efﬁcient therapy is frequently
challenging because tumor cells are either intrinsically resistant or acquire resistance to platinum drugs (2). In particular,

resistance to platinum-based drugs remains a major problem
in the management of advanced ovarian cancer. High-grade
serous ovarian cancers frequently exhibit a complete clinical
response to platinum-based drugs after initial chemotherapy.
However, the majority of these patients will relapse with a
progressive development of platinum drug resistance, resulting in overall poor prognosis. Hence, the underlying resistance
mechanisms to these chemotherapeutic drugs are subject to
intense studies (3).
Cisplatin reacts directly with DNA, inducing DNA inter- and
intrastrand cross-link lesions (ICL) in proliferating tissues, and
thereby triggering a DNA damage response (1). ICL repair is
complex, involving multiple DNA-repair pathways, and their
coordination and regulation relies heavily upon the interplay
between phosphorylation and ubiquitin signaling (4–6). Initial
recognition and removal of the ICL is coordinated by the
Fanconi anemia tumor suppressor pathway (7), which targets
the FANCI/FANCD2 complex for mono-ubiquitylation (8).
Subsequently, the mono-ubiquitylated FANCI/FANCD2 complex promotes the removal of ICL lesions by translesion
synthesis (TLS), as well as homologous recombination–dependent repair mechanisms (7). Moreover, DNA double-strand
breaks (DSB) have been identiﬁed as intermediates in ICL
repair during S phase, and their formation involves the activity
of the Mus81–Eme1 endonuclease (9). DSB repair is initiated by
the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) checkpoint kinasedependent phosphorylation of MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint), and the subsequent assembly of an ubiquitinsignaling complex, consisting of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8

and RNF168 (4, 10). RNF168 and RNF8 cooperate with BRCA1
to promote repair of DNA lesions (4, 11). Cancers with defects
in the ICL-repair pathway, which are frequently associated
with BRCA1 and BRCA2/FANCD1 deﬁciency, are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents, including cisplatin. Hence,
this provides a strong rationale to use cisplatin for the treatment of BRCA1/2 mutated tumors.
Less is known about the determinants and pathways that
sense excessive DNA cross-link damage, and that activate the
apoptotic cell death pathway that eliminates irreversibly damaged cells. The tumor suppressor p53, a transcription factor, is
stabilized and activated by genotoxic stress and triggers multiple effector pathways, including the intrinsic (also known as
mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway (reviewed in ref. 12). To
induce apoptosis, activated homotetrameric p53 directly transcriptionally upregulates the expression of several proapoptotic BCL-2 family members such as PUMA, NOXA, and BAX.
There is increasing evidence that excessive DNA damage,
including cisplatin-induced lesions, can also activate the
extrinsic death receptor apoptosis pathway (reviewed in refs.
13, 14). This pathway is triggered by the binding of death
ligands of the TNF family to their cognate receptors, and the
subsequent assembly of the receptor-associated death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Initiator caspases 8 and 10 are
activated within the DISC, and the death signal is ampliﬁed by
the subsequent proteolytic activation of downstream effector
caspases 3 and 7. Cisplatin treatment can also induce sustained
activation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), which triggers high
levels of the transcription factor AP-1 (15). This leads to the
expression of the FAS-L (FAS ligand) and consequently results
in FAS receptor-mediated apoptosis.
The identiﬁcation of novel determinants of the cellular
response to cisplatin and other platinum-based cancer drugs
might extend their clinical application, as well as provide
potential insight into drug resistance mechanisms. The use
of RNA interference (RNAi) as a tool for speciﬁcally silencing
genes has opened up the possibility of performing high
throughput loss-of-function and synthetic lethality screens.
We have used a collection of siRNA pools targeting the
expression of genes involved in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like
(UBL) signaling to address whether ablation of expression of
these proteins can cause cisplatin hypersensitivity. The screen
was carried out using human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, which
are p53 proﬁcient and exhibit a robust DNA damage response
(16). We identiﬁed the RING-in-between-RING E3 ubiquitin
ligase HOIP as a novel antiapoptotic regulator in response to
cisplatin-induced genotoxicity.

Materials and Methods
U2OS cells used in the siRNA screen were grown in phenol
red–free Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine.
The cell lines A2780, ZR.75.1, MDA-MB-231, PEA1, PEA2, PEO14,
and PEO23 were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Cisplatin-resistant A2780
cells were maintained as A2780 cells but supplemented with

www.aacrjournals.org

1 mmol/L cisplatin. HEK293, HeLa, HCT116, PC3, and U2OS
cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin. Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF)
were obtained from Prof. Philip Cohen (University of Dundee,
Dundee, United Kingdom) and maintained as for HEK293 cells,
with the addition of 1% sodium pyruvate and 1% nonessential
amino acids. Stably transfected Flp-In T-Rex-293 cells were
generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). A2780 and A2780 cisplatin-resistant cell lines were a
kind gift from Dr. Gillian Smith (University of Dundee, Dundee,
United Kingdom). PEA1, PEA2, PEO14, and PEO23 cell lines
were a kind gift from Dr. Simon Langdon (University of
Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom). These cell lines were
regularly examined for morphology and tested for cisplatin
sensitivity status. All other cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection, where they were authenticated using short tandem repeat analysis, and passaged for a
maximum of 2 months post resuscitation. All cell lines used
were tested regularly for mycoplasma contamination.
Cell proliferation assay
HEK293 cells were seeded at 25% to 30% conﬂuence in
10-cm2 dishes and treated with the indicated siRNA for 48
hours before being seeded at 5,000 cells per well in a 96-well
plate; ﬁve wells seeded for each dose of cisplatin. Cells were
allowed to adhere for a minimum of 8 hours before addition of
0 to 5 mg/mL cisplatin. Cells were grown for 72 to 96 hours
before MTS assays (Promega) were performed according to
manufacturer's instructions. Proliferation assays for all other
cells were carried out as for HEK293 cells, except that siRNA
treatments were performed on cells seeded in a 96-well plate.
Clonogenic survival assays
Clonogenic survival assays were performed in triplicate.
Cells were seeded at 25% conﬂuence and allowed to adhere
before being transfected with the indicated siRNA for 48 hours.
Cells were then seeded in 10-cm2 dishes at 5,000 cells per dish
and allowed to adhere before being treated with the indicated
concentrations of genotoxin for 24 hours. Cells were incubated
in fresh medium for 10 days and colonies containing more than
50 cells were counted.
Cell lysis and immunoblot analysis
Whole-cell extracts were prepared from mammalian cells by
lysis in 40 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and HALT protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Pierce Biotechnology). Clariﬁed protein
lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. ImageJ software was used to quantify immunoblots, and at least three independent experiments
were used to obtain results.
Caspase activity in vitro assay
Cells were seeded at 25% to 30% conﬂuence in 10-cm2 dishes
and treated with the indicated siRNA for 48 hours before
plating 10,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate, in triplicate for
each condition. Cells were grown in phenol red–free DMEM
and were replica plated on a 96-well plate for MTS assays.

Caspase activity was measured 48 hours after treatment with
the indicated dose of cisplatin, using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 or
Caspase-Glo 8 assays (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Caspase activity was normalized with
respect to cell number per well, as calculated by an MTS assay
(Promega).
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
Cells were treated with the indicated dose of genotoxin for
the times indicated in the ﬁgure legends, and processed as
described previously (17).
JNK in vitro kinase assay
JNK kinases were immunoprecipitated from 100 mg of
HEK293 cell whole-cell lysate, treated as indicated in the ﬁgure
legend, using 3 mg of anti-JNK1 antibody coupled to 10 mL
protein G Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed thoroughly in cell lysis buffer and then equilibrated in kinase assay
buffer (50 mmol/L Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA and 0.1%
2-mercaptoethanol). Assays were performed as described previously (18) using a peptide corresponding to GST-ATF2 amino
acids 19 to 96, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL as a substrate.
NF-kB luciferase reporter assay
Cells to be analyzed for NF-kB activation were seeded at
25% to 30% conﬂuence in 6-well plates and treated with the
indicated siRNA for 24 hours, or induced with tetracycline
for 24 hours, before transfection with 3  NF-kB ConA
luciferase reporter plasmid. After 24 hours, the indicated
concentrations of cisplatin were added to cells and luciferase activity was measured 24 or 48 hours later, as indicated.
Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed in triplicate
and luciferase signals were normalized with respect to the
cell lysate protein concentration.

Results
siRNA screen identiﬁes HOIP as an enhancer of cisplatininduced cytotoxicity
We designed a robust, high-throughput RNAi platform to
screen for enhancement of cisplatin-induced cell death in the
human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS. We used an siRNA library
targeting 1,067 human genes, which are either validated or
computationally predicted components related to the ubiquitin- and UBL signaling machinery (Supplementary Data).
These include ubiquitin, SUMO, NEDD8, E1s, E2s, E3s, UBLspeciﬁc proteases, and UBL-binding domain-containing proteins (siRNA "ubiquitome" library). The design of our enhancer
screen is outlined in Fig. 1A. Brieﬂy, U2OS cells were reverse
transfected in replicas with a library of siRNA pools (SMARTPools). Each plate contained nontransfected cells, negative
control (siCON, nontarget), and cells transfected with siRNA
against the positive control REV1L (siREV1L), a TLS polymerase required for ICL repair (19). Sixteen hours after transfection, one replica was treated with 3 mmol/L cisplatin and the
other replica with the vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cells
were incubated for further 72 hours and viability of cells was

assayed using an ATP-dependent cell viability assay. To quantify the robustness of this assay system, we calculated the Z0
factor. The average factor for our entire screen was Z0 ¼ 0.58,
indicating an excellent assay performance. The screen was
completed in duplicate. First, data were ﬁltered for lethal
siRNA by calculating cell growth (CGE) and rejecting siRNAs
causing CGE  50%. Second, we used a log2 surviving fraction
(log2SF) threshold of 1.47 or less to identify 112 siRNAs that
signiﬁcantly sensitized cells to cisplatin (Supplementary Data).
siRNAs from the primary screen were subjected to a secondary screen in which cells were treated with 0 to 6 mmol/L of
cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. S1A). This was performed in
triplicate, and dose-dependent log2SF functions were plotted
to determine the maximum log2SF for each siRNA (Fig. 1B).
Setting the threshold of the maximum log2SF values to 1.07,
we identiﬁed, with high conﬁdence, 14 siRNAs that sensitized
U2OS cells to cisplatin.
To test for off-target effects, the 14 siRNAs were assayed
separately with each of the four different siRNA species from
the SMARTPool that target the same gene. Such siRNAs were
considered to function on-target when at least three of the four
individual siRNAs caused enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. By
applying these strict criteria, we identiﬁed the E3 ubiquitin
ligase HOIP (RNF31) as being required for cellular resistance to
cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. S1B). HOIP is the catalytic subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase linear ubiquitin assembly
complex (LUBAC), which also consists of the components
HOIL-1L and SHARPIN (20, 21). LUBAC is a critical regulator
of the canonical NF-kB signaling pathway, and has been
implicated in inﬂammatory diseases and immune regulation
(22). No role, however, has been suggested for HOIP in response
to cisplatin. We therefore chose to examine the biological
signiﬁcance of HOIP depletion, and the mechanisms impacting
cisplatin hypersensitivity.
As further validation, we analyzed cisplatin sensitivity in
mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast (MEF) cell lines obtained from
paired wild-type and HOIPC879S/C879S E3 ligase-dead knockin
mice, in which there is no LUBAC activity and no detectable
linear ubiquitin chain formation (21). The HOIPC879S/C879S
MEFs exhibited cisplatin hypersensitivity, indicating that
HOIP ligase activity is required for cellular resistance to
cisplatin (Fig. 1C). In addition, we repeated cisplatin sensitivity
assays using transformed human embryonic kidney 293
(HEK293) cells. HOIP depletion (siHOIP) was conﬁrmed by
immunoblot analysis and resulted in enhanced cisplatin sensitivity when compared with cells transfected with vehicle only
(siCON; Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1C). Consistent with
published data, we noted that depletion of HOIP in HEK293
and U2OS cells resulted in destabilization of the LUBAC
complex members HOIL-1L and SHARPIN (Supplementary
Fig. S1D and S1E; refs. 23–25). siRNA targeting FAN1, a structure-speciﬁc nuclease required for interstrand cross-link
repair, was used as control for cisplatin hypersensitivity (26).
HOIP is not required for DNA damage checkpoint
activation
To uncover the mechanisms underlying cisplatin hypersensitivity of HOIP-depleted cells, we ﬁrst analyzed the integrity of

early DNA damage signaling mediated by the checkpoint
kinases ATM and ATR. Cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of
SMC1 on serine 966, a target of ATM, and phosphorylation of
CHK1 kinase on serine 345, a substrate of ATR, were unaffected
by HOIP depletion (siHOIP) in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). These
results indicate a robust and timely DNA damage checkpoint
activation. The presence of cisplatin-induced DNA lesions
triggers the checkpoint kinase-dependent phosphorylation of
the histone variant H2AX (g-H2AX). Distinct nuclear foci of
gH2AX can be visualized at sites of damage, allowing moni-

toring of DNA repair (27, 28). To test the possibility that
accumulation of persistent DNA damage is the cause of
cisplatin hypersensitivity, we monitored gH2AX foci formation
in mock (siCON) and HOIP-depleted (siHOIP) HEK293 cells,
following cisplatin exposure and recovery over 72 hours (Fig.
2B and C). HOIP-depleted cells show kinetics of accumulation
and resolution of gH2AX foci similar to those of mock transfected cells, suggesting that cisplatin hypersensitivity after
HOIP depletion is unlikely to be caused by an accumulation
of persistent cisplatin-induced DNA lesions.

hours the proteolytic cleavage of the effector caspase, caspase3, was almost undetectable in siCON control cells but greatly
increased when HOIP was depleted (Fig. 3A). Similar results
were obtained following treatment of cells with other genotoxins such as etoposide, hydroxyurea and ionizing radiation,
or stress stimuli, including the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the mitotic inhibitor taxol (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2E). We assayed caspase-3 activity in lysates of
either siCON- or siHOIP-depleted cells treated with cisplatin
and noted a modest elevation of caspase-3 activity in untreated
siHOIP cells. However, 48 hours after cisplatin exposure,
caspase-3 activity was signiﬁcantly enhanced in siHOIP cells,
compared with siCON cells (Fig. 3B and C). Importantly, we
also observe increased cisplatin-induced caspase-3 cleavage in
HOIPC879S/C879S MEFs when compared with control wild-type
MEFs (Fig. 3D). We tested whether the phenotype of HOIP
depletion could be mimicked by siRNA silencing of the LUBAC
subunits SHARPIN and HOIL-1L. Indeed, SHARPIN, but not
HOIL-1L, depletion causes a cisplatin-induced accumulation of
cleaved caspase-3, suggesting that HOIP and SHARPIN cooperate in an antiapoptotic cell death response (Fig. 3E and F).
Caspase-8 is one of the critical caspases upstream of caspase-3
and has been previously implicated in genotoxin-induced
apoptosis (29–31). To test whether caspase-8 mediates the
observed cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activation, cells were
pretreated with the speciﬁc caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK
before cisplatin treatment. Caspase-8 inhibition completely
abolished siHOIP-enhanced caspase-3 activation (Fig. 3G and
Supplementary Fig. S2F). In agreement with this, we observed a
signiﬁcant elevation of caspase-8 activity in HOIP-depleted
U2OS, as well as HEK293, cells after cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3H
and I). These data suggest that HOIP protects cells from
cisplatin-induced caspase-8–mediated apoptotic cell death.

Figure 2. HOIP is not required for DNA damage checkpoint activation. A,
HEK293 cells were transfected with siCON or siHOIP and treated with 5
mmol/L cisplatin for the indicated times. Cell lysates were analyzed by
immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated. B, siCON- or siHOIPtransfected HEK293 cells were treated with 8 mmol/L cisplatin for 2 hours
before being allowed to recover for the times indicated. Cells were then
ﬁxed and stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize
nuclei and g-H2AX antibody to visualize g-H2AX foci. C, quantitation of
the data in B: cells with more than six foci were classed as g-H2AX

HOIP depletion sensitizes cells to genotoxin-induced
apoptotic cell death
Cells trigger apoptotic cell death when genotoxic stress
exceeds a certain threshold or upon the accumulation of
persistent DNA lesions. It was recently shown that loss of
the LUBAC component SHARPIN increased susceptibility to
TNF-a–induced caspase-8/caspase-3–mediated apoptosis
(24). Given this, we hypothesized that HOIP depletion might
sensitize cells to apoptotic cell death following cisplatininduced damage. We treated U2OS and HEK293 cells with 5
mmol/L cisplatin and observed, in both cell lines, that after 48

Apoptotic sensitization of HOIP-depleted cells requires
ATM but occurs in the absence of NF-kB activation
Recent evidence indicates that ATM drives LUBAC-dependent linear ubiquitin chain formation on NEMO, which promotes NF-kB activation in cells exposed to topoisomerase
inhibitors, such as etoposide (32). We show that the highly
speciﬁc ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933 (Fig. 4A, B, and E;
ref. 33), but not the ATR kinase inhibitor ETP-46464 (Fig. 4C
and D; ref. 34) blocks enhanced proteolytic caspase-3 cleavage
in HOIP-depleted HEK293 and U2OS cells. Next, we analyzed
whether NF-kB signaling is implicated in the hyperapoptotic
cisplatin response observed in HOIP-depleted cells. We generated a HEK293 cell overexpressing a dominant mutant
version of the NF-kB inhibitory protein IkBa (IkBa S32A/
S36A), which cannot be phosphorylated by IkB kinase (IKK)
and thus cannot be targeted for proteasomal degradation (35).
Overexpression of IkBa S32A/S36A in HEK293 cells completely
abolished cisplatin-induced NF-kB activation (Supplementary
Fig. S3). We then transfected IkBa S32A/S36A expressing
HEK293 cells with either siCON or siHOIP followed by cisplatin
treatment for 48 hours. HOIP depletion in IkBa S32A/S36A
cells resulted in an elevation of caspase-3 activation in untreated cells (t ¼ 0 hours), and this was enhanced following cisplatin
exposure (t ¼ 48 hours; Fig. 4F). No signiﬁcant caspase-3

activation was detected in siCON-silenced IkBa S32A/S36A
cells following cisplatin exposure. Cumulatively, this suggests
that cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death in HOIP-depleted
cells occurs independently of NF-kB activation.
JNK activity is elevated in HOIP-depleted cells
In addition to NF-kB activation, extensive DNA damage
triggers activation of the stress-responsive JNK and induces
Fas-Associated Death Domain (FADD)-mediated pro-caspase8 activation (36). We, therefore, assayed JNK activity by monitoring JNK-targeted phosphorylation of c-Jun (P-c-Jun) in
response to cisplatin. We observed that HOIP-depleted cells
respond with enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, suggesting
increased JNK activity (Fig. 5A). To assess JNK kinase activity
directly, we immunoprecipitated JNK from cell lysates of mock
() or cisplatin (þ)-treated cells that were either siCON or
siHOIP transfected, and assayed the kinase in vitro. In agree-

ment with increased P-c-JUN, we observed a signiﬁcantly
enhanced basal, as well as cisplatin-induced, JNK activity in
HOIP-depleted cells (Fig. 5B). To test whether ATM is required
for cisplatin-induced JNK activation, we pretreated cells with
ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933 (ATMi) following cisplatin
treatment. ATM inhibition had no effect on JNK activation,
suggesting that ATM checkpoint activation is not regulating
JNK activity in response to cisplatin (Fig. 5B). Using the highly
speciﬁc JNK inhibitor JNK-IN-8 (37), we next showed that
caspase-3 processing in HOIP-depleted HEK293 cells was
signiﬁcantly suppressed (Fig. 5C), and cisplatin hypersensitivity reversed (Fig. 5D), following JNK inhibition. Consistent with
HEK293 cells, HOIP depletion in U2OS cells triggered elevation
of both basal and cisplatin-induced JNK activity (Fig. 5E).
However, JNK inhibition did not alleviate caspase-3 hyperactivation in HOIP-depleted U2OS cells, suggesting a cell type–
speciﬁc requirement of JNK in apoptotic cell death.

HOIP depletion induces cisplatin hypersensitivity in
different types of cancer cells
We demonstrate here that HOIP depletion sensitizes U2OS
osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death.
These ﬁndings suggest potential strategies to sensitize cancer
cells or, even more relevantly, to resensitize cancer cells that
have become resistant following prolonged cisplatin exposure.
To test this concept, we studied the effect of HOIP depletion in
a panel of cancer cell lines derived from different tissues.
HCT116 (colon), HeLa (cervix), PC3 (prostate), ZR.75.1 (breast),
MDA-MB-231 (breast), and PEA1 (ovary) were transfected with
either siCON or siHOIP and analyzed for cisplatin-induced
caspase-3 activation. In addition, cell viability was determined
following exposure to a dose range of cisplatin (Fig. 6). Consistently, all siHOIP-transfected cancer cell lines exhibited, to
varying degrees, elevated cleaved caspase-3 after cisplatin
exposure, which coincided with increased cisplatin sensitivity.
The PEA1 ovarian cancer cell line exhibits particularly
striking cisplatin hypersensitivity upon HOIP depletion. Dur-

ing platinum drug chemotherapy, ovarian cancers frequently
develop drug resistance. Hence, we next addressed whether
cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells can be resensitized by
HOIP-depletion. We analyzed paired platinum sensitive
(A2780CisS) and resistant (A2780CisR) ovarian tumor cell lines.
A2780CisR cells are in vitro derivatives of the sensitive
A2780CisS cells that have acquired resistance through continuous treatment with cisplatin (38). A2780CisS and
A2780CisR cells were transfected with either siCON or siHOIP
and cellular viability was determined following exposure to
cisplatin. HOIP depletion modestly sensitized A2780CisS cells
(Fig. 7A); however, depletion resulted in a signiﬁcant resensitization of A2780CisR cells (Fig. 7B). Importantly, A2780CisS
and A2780CisR cells also showed increased apoptosis following HOIP depletion (Fig. 7A and B). Next, we investigated
high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGS) derived from cases
of HGS carcinomas before and after the development of
platinum resistance (39). HOIP depletion in the matched
pair of PEA1CisS and PEA2CisR triggered enhanced cisplatin

sensitivity in both cell lines (Fig. 7C and D). Similar results
were obtained from the matching pair of PEO14CisS and
PEO23CisR, suggesting that HOIP protects these cells from
cisplatin genotoxicity (Fig. 7E and F).

Discussion
Managing resistance that occurs during platinum-based
drug chemotherapy remains a major challenge in the treatment of ovarian and other cancers, and results in poor prognosis for successful eradication of the cancer. Cells respond to
platinum drugs in several ways and the resistance mechanisms
modulating these responses, to protect cells from platinum
genotoxicity, are equally complex. Typically for platinumbased drugs, cancer cells frequently gain resistance by reduced
cellular drug uptake, increased drug efﬂux, increased DNA
repair and MHL1 hypermethylation (3). In this study, we
identiﬁed HOIP, the catalytic E3 ubiquitin ligase component
of LUBAC, as an antiapoptotic factor attenuating the genotoxic
effect of genotoxic agents including cisplatin. We provide
evidence that HOIP depletion in several cancer cell lines can

www.aacrjournals.org

potentiate cellular genotoxicity of cisplatin due to enhanced
apoptotic cell death response.
We show that two subunits of LUBAC, HOIP and SHARPIN, are required to suppress cisplatin-induced apoptosis,
whereas we have no evidence that the subunit HOIL-1L
participates in the cisplatin response. Studies in vitro have
demonstrated that HOIP on its own has only weak E3
ubiquitin ligase activity, but that its catalytic activity is
strongly enhanced in the presence of either SHARPIN or
HOIL-1L, assembling a HOIP/SHARPIN or HOIP/HOIL-1L
complex respectively (40, 41). It is debatable whether these
subcomplexes coexist in vivo; however, genetic evidence
supports the idea that these LUBAC subcomplexes have
separable functions (22). SHARPIN-deﬁcient mice exhibit
chronic proliferative dermatitis (cpdm), a pathology not
observed in HOIL-1L–deﬁcient mice. Moreover, these studies show that SHAPRIN-deﬁcient MEFs have far higher levels
of TNF-a–induced FADD and caspase-8–dependent apoptotic cell death than cells from HOIL-1L–deﬁcient mice (24).
TNF-a–induced apoptosis is triggered by the formation of
a TRADD–TRAF2–RIP1–FADD–caspase-8 death-promoting

Figure 6. HOIP depletion sensitizes a range of cancer cell lines to cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death. HCT116 (A), HeLa (B), PC3 (C), ZR.75.1 (D),
MDA-MB-231 (E), or PEA1 (F) cells were transfected with mock siRNA (siCON) or siRNA targeting HOIP (siHOIP) and treated with 5 mmol/L cisplatin for the
indicated time before cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated (top). Cell viability of siCON- or siHOIP-transfected cells in

complex (TNFR1 complex II), whereas in response to genotoxic stress, an analogous ripoptosome complex, consisting
of RIP1–FADD–capase-8, is formed (42). Moreover, CUL3
RING ligase-mediated polyubiquitylation of caspase-8 stabilizes and promotes caspase-8 activity (43). It is tempting to
speculate that a HOIP/SHARPIN ligase complex regulates
cisplatin-induced apoptosis via ripoptosome assembly and
activity. Indeed, this idea is supported by data indicating
that the ripoptosome component RIP1 is modiﬁed with
linear ubiquitin chains (23, 44). Whether the ripoptosome
components are direct targets for HOIP/SHARPIN-mediated
linear ubiquitylation following genotoxic stress will be the
subject of future investigations.

Besides an essential function for ATM in promoting the
apoptotic cell death response in response to cisplatin, we found
that basal and cisplatin-induced JNK kinase activity is significantly upregulated in HOIP-depleted cells. It has been shown
that sustained activation of JNK in ovarian cancer cells, in
response to cisplatin, leads to activation of the AP-1 transcription factor and AP-1–induced FAS-L expression leading, in
turn, to Fas receptor–triggered apoptosis (15). Moreover, JNK
activation has previously been linked to the degradation of the
antiapoptotic factor c-FLIPL, suggesting that JNK hyperactivation would lead to an enhanced ripoptosome/caspase-8 activity (45). The importance of the JNK/FAS apoptosis pathway
is further demonstrated by the observation that several

independently derived cisplatin-resistant cancer cell lines
exhibit attenuated JNK activation (46).
The design of the RNAi approach applied in this study
allowed us to screen directly for targets whose downregulation might either sensitize cancer cells for cisplatin or might
reverse cisplatin resistance in tumors. In all cancer cells
tested, siRNA depletion of HOIP reduced their viability and
enhanced apoptotic cell death following cisplatin exposure.
Enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis was also observed in
HOIPC879S/C879S MEFs that express catalytically inactive
HOIP. We, therefore, propose that HOIP E3 ligase activity
plays a critical role in limiting apoptotic cell death upon
cisplatin exposure. Indeed, our data show that HOIP-depleted cells exhibit enhanced apoptosis in response to treatment
with a wide range of genotoxins, as well as nongenotoxic
cellular stress inducers. This suggests that a HOIP-dependent antiapoptotic mechanism is likely to be conserved in
the response to cellular stress in general. Hence, blocking or
easing the antiapoptotic function of HOIP will render cancer
cells more susceptible to apoptosis, and low levels of genotoxic stress will trigger apoptotic cell death.
Although it is clear that HOIP depletion renders cells hypersensitive to cisplatin treatment, based on our current knowledge it is not clear what, if any, contribution HOIP has to drug
resistance. Some evidence that HOIP overexpression may
contribute to cisplatin resistance in cancer comes from
large-scale gene–drug association studies (https://www.oncomine.com; ref. 47). Expression proﬁle data from a panel of
several hundred cancer cell lines derived from tumors classiﬁed as cisplatin resistant or cisplatin sensitive have revealed

www.aacrjournals.org

that cisplatin-resistant cancer cell lines (n ¼ 335) show a
signiﬁcantly higher expression of HOIP (P ¼ 0.011) and SHARPIN (P ¼ 0.016) when compared with cisplatin-sensitive cancer
cell lines (n ¼ 29; Supplementary Fig. S4). Oncomine analysis
also revealed that both HOIP and SHARPIN are overexpressed
in serous ovarian carcinomas patient samples compared with
normal tissue (Supplementary Fig. S5). These data suggest that
HOIP/SHARPIN expression is altered in cancer cell lines, and
that an elevation of HOIP and HOIP's antiapoptotic function
may promote cisplatin resistance.
Enhancing or reestablishing the apoptotic cell death
program in tumor cells is a promising strategy for cancer
therapy. On the basis of our ﬁndings, we propose that smallmolecule inhibitory drugs targeting HOIP E3 ligase activity,
used in combination with cisplatin chemotherapy, might
potentiate caspase-8–mediated death in cancer cells. This
concept is supported by recent studies that describe Smac
mimetics, i.e., small molecules that mimic the antagonistic
activity of Smac toward inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP),
as efﬁcient potentiators of cancer cell apoptosis. They
stimulate IAP auto-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, leading to TNF-a signaling, which, in turn, induces
ripoptosome activation and caspase-8–dependent cell death
in multiple cancer cell lines (48–50). We predict that HOIP
inhibitors, although acting through mechanisms different
from those of the Smac mimetics, would signiﬁcantly upregulate cisplatin-induced caspase-8 activity. HOIP depletion
or deﬁciency does not kill transformed cells and hence HOIP
inhibitors are unlikely to be toxic when used alone. However,
HOIP plays a critical role in the innate immune response and

the application of HOIP inhibitors bear the potential risk of
stimulating inﬂammatory and/or auto-inﬂammatory side
effects (22). An in-depth analysis of the impact of HOIP
inhibition is needed to fully understand how HOIP can best
be exploited as an anticancer drug target. This study, however, provides the rationale for the development of HOIP
inhibitors to increase not only the efﬁcacy of ﬁrst-line
cisplatin chemotherapy but also to achieve a better clinical
outcome of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in drug-resistant
cancer.
