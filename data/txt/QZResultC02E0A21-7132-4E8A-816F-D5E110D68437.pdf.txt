Abstract
This study determined whether expression levels of a panel of biologically relevant microRNAs can be used
as prognostic or predictive biomarkers in patients who participated in the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer
Trial (IALT), the largest randomized study conducted to date of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with radically resected non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155,
and let-7a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 639 IALT patients. The prognostic and predictive values of microRNA expression for survival were
studied using a Cox model, which included every factor used in the stratified randomization, clinicopathologic
prognostic factors, and other factors statistically related to microRNA expression. Investigation of the expression pattern of microRNAs in situ was performed. We also analyzed the association of TP53 mutation status
and miR-34a/b/c expression, epidermal growth factor receptor and KRAS mutation status, and miR-21 and
Let-7a expression. Finally, the association of p16 and miR-29b expression was assessed. Overall, no significant
association was found between any of the tested microRNAs and survival, with the exception of miR-21 for
which a deleterious prognostic effect of lowered expression was suggested. Otherwise, no single or combinatorial microRNA expression profile predicted response to adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Together,
our results indicate that the microRNA expression patterns examined were neither predictive nor prognostic
in a large patient cohort with radically resected NSCLC, randomized to receive adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus follow-up only. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8288–98. ©2010 AACR.

MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNA species of
20 to 22 nucleotides that have been implicated in the control
of many fundamental cellular and physiologic processes such
as cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and stem

cell maintenance (1). MicroRNAs have been shown to play
key roles in carcinogenesis, and some microRNAs have been
categorized as “oncomiRs” as opposed to “tumor-suppressor
miRs” (2). The expression patterns of microRNAs are often
tissue specific, and certain cancer types can be classified
based on microRNA expression profiles (3, 4). Importantly,
the expression of certain microRNAs has been associated
with chemoresistance (5, 6).
Early-stage non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients who undergo complete surgical tumor resection still
develop distant metastases in 50% to 70% of cases, resulting
in an overall 5-year survival rate of only 40% (7). The International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) showed that adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy improves the 5-year
survival rate in this patient category by an absolute value
of 4.1% (8). Two additional randomized studies have confirmed the prolonged 5-year survival rate in stage IB to IIIA
NSCLC patients treated with adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. A third study, using carboplatin-paclitaxel, did not
confirm this for stage IB disease (9–11). Currently, cisplatinbased adjuvant chemotherapy is considered part of the standard management of patients with completely resected
stage II and III NSCLC. Nevertheless, the survival benefit of

MicroRNA Expression and Outcome in Resected NSCLC

adjuvant chemotherapy remains limited to a subgroup of
treated patients, and a recent update by the IALT investigators
showed that the benefit of chemotherapy does not exist beyond 5 years of follow-up (12).
The IALT Biologic Program (IALT-Bio) was established,
aiming to define biomarkers predictive for outcome of adjuvant chemotherapy as well as biomarkers prognostic for
NSCLC overall survival. A predictive marker refers to a patient
or tumor characteristic that is associated with therapy response. A prognostic marker refers to a characteristic of a patient or tumor at the time of diagnosis that can be used to
estimate the outcome. It was shown that IALT cases with
low excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1),
as well as low p27kip1 expression, benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (7, 13). Importantly, ERCC1 expression remained
predictive at 8 years of follow-up (12). Expression levels of multidrug resistance proteins MRP1 and MRP2 had no predictive
value, but MRP2 was shown to be a strong prognostic factor
(14). Based on our prior work as well as the literature, we analyzed in the IALT cohort the expression of seven biologically
relevant microRNAs: miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155,
and let-7a. Using a microRNA microarray approach, we have
previously identified microRNA expression profiles unique for
NSCLC subtypes. We showed that high miR-155 and low let-7a
expression were associated with poor patient survival (15).
Other reports also suggested a protective effect of let-7a expression in terms of survival and treatment outcome (16, 17)
and showed that reduced let-7, which is known to interact
with KRAS, is a prognostic factor in lung cancer and can contribute to carcinogenesis (18–20). Furthermore, we have previously reported on low miR-21 expression as a biomarker for
favorable outcome of adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer,
as well as increased miR-21 expression in epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) mutant tumors (21, 22). Numerous other studies support a prognostic or treatment-predictive role
for miR-21 (23, 24).
MicroRNA-34a has been proposed as a prognostic marker
of relapse in surgically resected NSCLC. Tumor-suppressor
p53, frequently inactivated in NSCLC, is known to activate
the transcription of miR-34a as well as miR-34b and miR-34c,
containing a p53 binding site in their promoter (25–29). Finally,
reduced expression of miR-29b, known to target de novo DNA
methyltransferase 3A and 3B (DNMT3A and DNMT3B), can
lead to global hypermethylation and silencing of various
tumor-suppressor genes (30, 31). Methylation of tumorsuppressor p16 is a prognostic indicator in lung cancer. Thus
far, a potential association between p16 expression and
miR-29b expression has not been investigated (7).
Our main hypothesis was that expression of the seven selected microRNAs in tumor specimens from IALT patients
could predict treatment response and survival benefit from
adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, we hypothesized that
associations of microRNAs and prognosis would differ in
lung adenocarcinoma patients compared with squamous cell
carcinoma patients. As a secondary analysis, we evaluated
whether microRNA expression status was associated with
molecular markers relevant in lung cancer (EGFR, KRAS,
and TP53 mutation status as well as p16 expression),

www.aacrjournals.org

for which data was available in the IALT cohort. Finally,
we performed in situ investigation of microRNA expression
in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.

Materials and Methods
Patients and study design
Patients were enrolled in the IALT study, which randomized
1,867 patients with completely resected NSCLC, stages I
through III, to receive adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy
or follow-up. See Supplementary Appendix S1 for a list of the
IALT-Bio Participating Centers. FFPE tumor specimens were
collected from patients at 28 centers in 14 countries that had
recruited more than 10 patients (13). A total of 867 samples
were reviewed centrally at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire
Albert Michallon (Grenoble, France), according to the histopathologic classification system adopted by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in 2004. The amount and quality of 824 of
867 blocks were judged adequate for serial sectioning and experimental procedures. Ultimately, 783 were judged NSCLC after central review. Approval for the study was obtained from
local institutional review boards according to the legal regulations in each participating country. For in situ hybridization
experiments, additional tissue sections of NSCLC cases were
obtained through the Department of Pathology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD. The use of these sections was
granted approval by the institutional review board of the
National Cancer Institute and was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Maryland.
RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR
Sections were all processed at the National Cancer Institute by the Lung Cancer Laboratory (Medical Oncology
Branch) and the Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis. To
ensure consistency in experimental conditions, uniform procedures, reagents, and equipment were used. Staff members
involved in experimental procedures were jointly trained. All
reagents, including all quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR
(qRT-PCR) reagents, were ordered in one batch, centrally
stored, and distributed among staff members of the two participating laboratories. Furthermore, all qRT-PCR microRNA
Taqman assays (see also below) were performed on the same
equipment. Samples with insufficient or necrotic tumor material were omitted from further processing (n = 86). In total,
697 tumor samples, as well as 79 adjacent normal tissue specimens, were processed.
Specimens consisted of 10-μm FFPE sections. We disposed
only of one section per patient case. Glass slides containing
the tissue section were cut using a diamond pen in two parts.
One part was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and
used for qRT-PCR. The other unstained part was available for
in situ hybridization. H&E-stained tissues were marked by a
lung pathologist for tumor area and, if present, normal tissue
area under a BX40 light microscope (Olympus). Each area
was macrodissected with sterile disposable scalpels (Cincinnati Surgical Company) for RNA isolation using the RecoverAll
Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Ambion). Forty nanograms of

RNA were required for expression analysis of miR-21, miR-29b,
miR-34a, miR-34b, miR-34c, let-7a, and miR-155.
qRT-PCR of microRNAs was performed using TaqMan
microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) and the 7900 HT-Fast
real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). We used small
nRNA U66 as endogenous normalization control, consistent
with our prior report on miR-34a, miR-34b, and miR-34c expression (32). All assays were performed in triplicate by investigators who were blinded to clinical data of the sample
cohort. MicroRNA expression was quantified as δCt values,
where Ct = threshold cycle, δCt = (Ct target microRNA −
Ct RNU66). δCt was calculated using RQ manager software,
version 1.2 (Applied Biosystems).
Replicates with a Ct SD greater than 1, or, in case of U66
only, with an average Ct greater than 35, were omitted from
further analysis (n = 58), resulting in a dataset of 639 cases. In
case expression of a microRNA was available for both tumor
and normal tissue, microRNA expression was additionally
quantified as δδCt values, δδCt = (δCt target microRNA
tumor tissue − δCt target microRNA matched normal tissue),
for a separate analysis.
In situ hybridization
In situ investigation of microRNA expression in lung cancer was performed on a selection of the IALT-Bio cases as
well as on lung cancer tissue sections procured from the
University of Maryland (see also above). Probes for human
miR-21, miR-34a, miR-155, and let-7a were used (Exiqon).
U6 and Scramble probes were used as positive and negative
controls, respectively. For in situ investigation of microRNA
expression, we used the method as previously reported (21).
In situ hybridization conditions for each individual probe
were optimized using serial tissue sections from University
of Maryland lung cancer cases because serial sections of
IALT-Bio cases were not available. Methodology updates included the use of biotin-labeled microRNA probes (Exiqon)
and a biotinyl tyramide–based system (GenPoint, Catalyzed
Signal Amplification System; DAKO) and Vector NovaRed
(Vector Laboratories) as a substrate (brown/red). Tissues
were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (blue). Images
were taken on a BX40 light microscope using the Olympus
DP70 digital camera and DP controller software (Olympus).
Staining results were confirmed by an independent pathologist at the National Cancer Institute.
Statistical analysis
National Cancer Institute investigators involved in experimental procedures remained blinded to any of the clinical
data. All statistical analyses were performed at the Institute
Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, France). Initial analysis of microRNA expression values revealed heterogeneity in the data distribution of the tumor specimens between the two
laboratories. The data were therefore standardized by subtracting the subgroup mean and division by the subgroup
SD. Subgroups were well balanced with respect to treatment
(adjuvant chemotherapy arm and control arm). To remove
the potential bias in the results, the median standardized value was a priori chosen as cutoff to determine the microRNA

8290

expression status. MicroRNA expression was defined as negative when the expression value was lower than the median and
positive when the expression value was equal or greater than the
median. To test for differences between microRNA-negative
and microRNA-positive samples, comparisons had to take into account the study centers. Therefore, logistic regression
stratified by center was used both for univariate and multivariate analyses. The prognostic value of microRNA status and
chemotherapy for survival were studied using a Cox model.
As in the original IALT analysis, the Cox model included every
factor used in the stratified randomization [center, tumor
stage, and type of surgery (pneumonectomy, lobectomy, segmentectomy), plus clinical and histologic prognostic factors
(age <55, 55–64, >64 years), sex, WHO performance status,
nodal status, lymphoid infiltration (not intense, intense),
and the revised histopathologic type (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, other NSCLC); ref. 8]. All other factors
that were statistically related to microRNA expression in the
multivariate logistic model (P < 0.05) were added to the survival Cox model. Trend tests were performed using the continuous standardized values instead of the dichotomized values
(positive versus negative). Analyses were also performed using
distribution quartiles of the standardized values.
The predictive value of each microRNA was studied by testing the interaction between microRNA expression and the attributed treatment (chemotherapy or no chemotherapy)
in the same Cox model. To study the association between
microRNAs and other markers, logistic regression of
the marker on either positivity or standardized value of
microRNA expression (denoted “trend”), stratified by center,
was used. For analysis using normal and/or normal-tumor
matched expression levels, the Cox survival model had to
be simplified due to the low number of available cases. Stratification by two regions of the world (Western Europe versus
other parts of the world) was used. Furthermore, a smaller
number of adjustment variables were entered in the model:
only stage (the only significant prognostic factor) plus histology and the variable(s) correlated with each microRNA. To
study variation of the prognostic effect with histology, only squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma were considered.
All analyses were performed with long-term survival data
(12). All reported P values were two-sided. P values <0.01 were
considered statistically significant to limit the risk of falsepositive results. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.).

Results
After quality control, 639 IALT-Bio samples remained that
had measurements of at least one microRNA. Patient characteristics are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Patient characteristics varied in relation to the sample size per evaluated
microRNA.
Association of microRNA expression and
clinicopathologic covariates
As microRNA expression is thought to vary according to
histotypes and could be associated with tumor characteristics,

MicroRNA Expression and Outcome in Resected NSCLC

we explored associations between individual microRNA
expression patterns and the clinicopathologic variables.
The associations remaining significant in the multivariate
analysis are summarized in Table 1. miR-21 status was associated with histology (P = 0.04) and lymphoid infiltration
(P = 0.04); miR-29b status was associated with age (P = 0.03),
histology (P ≤ 0.0001), and lymphoid infiltration (P = 0.005);
miR-34a status was associated with histology (P = 0.0002), lymphoid infiltration (P = 0.03), and lymphatic invasion (P = 0.04);
miR-34b status was associated with disease stage (P = 0.04) and
histology (P = 0.01); miR-34c status was associated with histology (P = 0.0002); miR-155 status was associated with lymphoid
infiltration (P = 0.001); and no covariates were associated with

let-7a status. Supplementary Table S2 summarizes the association of microRNA expression with covariates (univariate analysis or trend test). See also Supplementary Tables S3 to S9 for a
complete overview of all univariate analyses per microRNA.
Prognostic analysis
Next, we investigated the prognostic value of microRNA
expression. The expression status of none of the microRNAs
was significantly prognostic for outcome (see Fig. 1, as well
as Table 2 for a summary of results). However, there is a borderline prognostic effect of miR-21 expression on overall survival with a worse survival for miR-21–negative cases (P = 0.06;
trend: P = 0.01). Although there is no prognostic effect of

prognostic association was no longer significant (HR, 0.84;
95% CI, 0.68–1.04; P = 0.11).
Predictive analysis
As microRNA expression status has been associated with
treatment response, we next investigated the predictive value
of the seven microRNAs (21, 33). Expression status of none of
the microRNAs had a predictive effect on survival. See Table 3
for a summary of results as well as Supplementary Fig. S1
for Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival according to
treatment in microRNA-positive patients compared with
microRNA-negative patients.
Additional prognostic and predictive analyses
As initial analysis of microRNA expression values revealed
heterogeneity in the data distribution between the two laboratories, separate prognostic and predictive analyses were
performed in both groups to exclude an effect of the standardization procedure on the study outcome and to confirm
that negative results were not due to inconsistent assay results.
There was no difference in the prognostic effect of any of
the seven microRNAs in both groups. There was no difference
in the predictive effect of miR-21, miR-34a, miR-34b, miR-34c,
or let-7a in both groups. There was a borderline difference in
the predictive effect of miR-29b in both groups (P = 0.03 for
comparing the interactions and P = 0.04 for comparing deviations from the group averages), but the heterogeneity and trend
test did not show anything consistent. There was a difference in
the predictive effect of miR-155 in both groups [P = 0.007 for
comparing the treatment interaction; however, the difference
was not significant for comparing deviations from the group
averages (P = 0.12) or in the trend tests (P = 0.07)]. As the variations of the HRs in the quartiles within each group were not consistent, the likelihood of a predictive effect is low. Furthermore,

www.aacrjournals.org

for predictive analyses, the treatment effect of chemotherapy
was borderline significantly different between both groups,
and differences in predictive effects of microRNA expression
profiles should therefore be interpreted with respect to the
average treatment effect in the group. More details regarding
these additional analyses are available upon request.
Association of microRNA expression with other
IALT-Bio markers
As we did not find a significant predictive or prognostic
effect of any of the candidate microRNAs, we subsequently assessed in a secondary analysis the association of microRNAs
and other molecular markers relevant in lung cancer. We were
able to perform these analyses because data were or became
available in the course of the study. It was hypothesized that a
combined protein and microRNA expression signature could
also potentially be of predictive and/or prognostic value.
Because p53 activity is associated with miR-34a/b/c transcription, we looked at an association between TP53 mutations and miR-34a/b/c expression. IALT-Bio investigators
previously reported on the prognostic and predictive values
of TP53 mutations (exons 5–8) and KRAS mutations (codons
12 and 13) in the IALT-Bio cohort (34). TP53 mutations were
shown in 46% of patients. After 8 years of follow-up, no prognostic value for TP53 mutation status was shown in all cases
grouped together. It was recently suggested that patients with
nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC and TP53 wild-type might benefit from adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, whereas
it might be less beneficial in patients with mutated TP53 (34).
Nevertheless, there was no global association between TP53
mutations and miR-34a status (positivity: P = 0.70; trend:
P = 0.33). The association between TP53 mutations and
miR-34a positivity did not vary with histology (P = 0.23). Equally,
there was no global association between TP53 mutations and

miR-34b or miR-34c (positivity: P = 0.91, trend: P = 0.49; positivity: P = 0.57, trend: P = 0.35, respectively), and this did
not vary with stratification for histology (P = 0.47; P = 0.78,
respectively).

Next, we looked at potential associations between miR-21
expression and EGFR mutation status, as increased miR-21
expression was previously detected in EGFR mutant tumors,
EGFR being one of the key markers in NSCLC biology (22).

MicroRNA Expression and Outcome in Resected NSCLC

Only 20 tumors had EGFR mutations and it was therefore not
possible to perform a subanalysis by histology. We did not detect a global association between occurrence of EGFR mutations and miR-21 expression (positivity: P = 0.73, trend: P = 0.29).
In the aforementioned study, KRAS mutation was suggested to be a biomarker of poor prognosis in patients with
nonadenocarcinoma (34). Because KRAS is one of the known
targets of let-7a, we investigated the association of KRAS mutations and let-7a expression. We found that there is a global
borderline association between KRAS mutations and let-7a
(positivity: P = 0.10, trend: P = 0.03). The association between
KRAS mutations and let-7a positivity did not vary with histology (P = 0.42).
Finally, we assessed a potential association between miR29b and p16 expression. De novo DNMT3A and DNMT3B are
targets of miR-29b, and p16 expression is silenced in lung cancer due to hypermethylation. However, we found that there is
no global association between p16 expression as assessed by
immunohistochemistry and miR-29b (positivity: P = 0.14,
trend: P = 0.10). The association between p16 IHC positivity
and miR-29b positivity did not vary with histology (P = 0.86).
Analyses using tumor adjacent normal tissue
In total, 79 samples have measurements of a least one
matched tumor and normal microRNA. The median expression ratio for tumor and normal tissues (T/N) was, as expected,
positive for the oncomiRs miR-21 [0.95 ± 1.33 (±SD)] and
miR-155 (0.05 ± 1.13), indicating a higher expression in the tumor tissue compared with the normal tissue. Relative T/N expression was, as expected, negative for the tumor-suppressor
miRs miR-29b (−0.68 ± 1.33), miR-34a (−0.40 ± 1.38), miR-34b
(−0.37 ± 2.88), miR-34c (−0.51 ± 2.73), and let-7a (−0.61 ± 1.40).
In situ hybridization
We performed in situ hybridization of the seven tested
microRNAs. For the IALT-Bio cohort, none of the tested
microRNAs were prognostic or predictive. MicroRNA-21
was the only microRNA with a suggested deleterious prognostic effect of lower values. Figure 2 shows a representative
pattern of in situ miR-21 staining in a NSCLC adenocarcinoma
case with high miR-21 expression according to the qRT-PCR
assay. In general, we observed that staining was exclusively
present in the cytoplasm for all probes except, as expected,
for the experimental control, endogenous small nucleolar
RNA U6, which showed nuclear expression. As for miR-155
staining, we frequently observed that the staining was localized to the outer end/leading edge of each nodule of squamous
cells within the tumor. Additionally, Fig. 2 shows miR-34a– and
let-7a–positive cases (data for miR-29b, miR-34b/c not shown).

Discussion
Based on preclinical studies as well as translational studies
using clinical specimens, microRNA expression levels have
been suggested to be biomarkers for prognosis as well as
treatment outcome in numerous malignancies (35–37). Expression of seven candidate microRNAs was hypothesized
to predict outcome of adjuvant chemotherapy in NSCLC,

www.aacrjournals.org

aiming to establish routine markers for selection of patients
for adjuvant chemotherapy to improve treatment outcome.
We tested this hypothesis in a very large NSCLC cohort of
639 cases, randomized for treatment, using extensive quality
and methodologic control measures. We disposed of only
one tumor section per case and made a selection of seven
biologically relevant microRNAs to be analyzed for associations with clinicopathologic covariates, prognosis, and treatment outcome.
Interestingly, microRNA expression correlated with histology for five of seven microRNAs assessed: miR-21, miR-29b,
and miR-34a/b/c. Recently, a study on microRNA expression
profiling was reported using 290 FFPE specimens from the
EAGLE study, a population-based case-control study in lung
cancer (38). A microRNA signature, including miR-29b and
let-7a, was identified, which strongly differentiated histologic
subtypes (i.e., adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma)
in male patients who were smokers. Interestingly, cigarette
smoking intensity showed an inverse correlation with let-7
expression in female adenocarcinoma patients and a positive
correlation with miR-21 expression in male squamous cell
carcinoma patients. Furthermore, only in the group of male
smokers with squamous cell carcinoma, a prognostic
miR signature could be established, which included
miR-34c-5p and miR-34a (38). Unfortunately, we did not dispose of smoking status data for IALT cases to confirm these
relationships.
We found that positive expression of miR-21, miR-29b,
miR-34a, and miR-155 was associated with intense lymphoid
infiltration or the presence of lymphatic invasion (miR-34a only).
In this regard, it was previously shown that miR-21 expression
is associated with an increased rate of lymph node metastasis
in breast cancer and colorectal cancer patients (39, 40).
Overall, we were not able to show a prognostic value of any
of the seven microRNAs in this patient cohort. Upregulated
miR-21 expression has been previously associated with worse
outcome in NSCLC cases (23, 24, 41). However, the study by
Markou and colleagues consisted of few cases, 48, which made
use of matched tumor and normal tissues (24). Consequently,
results reported were based on the T/N expression ratio. In
contrast, for our main analysis, we made use of tumor tissue
expression values. Additionally, the study by Raponi and colleagues made use of a microRNA array approach (23). Another
characteristic of our study was that we disposed only of
FFPE tissue sections instead of frozen tumor specimens.
We established an association between let-7a expression
and KRAS mutation status, albeit only in the multivariate
analysis on the means and not the dichotomized expression
values. The significance of this finding is unclear. Thus far, it
has been reported that the KRAS-LCS6 polymorphism results
in upregulation of the KRAS gene and concomitant downregulation of let-7 (42). However, this polymorphism was
not found to be associated with KRAS mutations (43).
We could not confirm an association between EGFR mutation status and miR-21 expression, as reported previously (22).
Additionally, we could not show a predictive effect of
any of the seven microRNAs on treatment outcome, which
consisted of cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Drugs

types, but was not limited to these specific

was limited to the cytoplasm, as expected, and
was diffusely localized within tumor types
except for miR-155 in squamous cell carcinoma.
Mir-155 was expressed in cells on the edge of
squamous cell nodules within squamous cell
carcinomas. U6 (E) and Scramble (F) probes
were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively.

MicroRNA Expression and Outcome in Resected NSCLC

combined with cisplatin among the 639 patients were etoposide (54%), vinorelbine (33%), vinblastine (8%), or vindesine
(6%; ref. 8). We previously showed that high microRNA-21 expression is related to fluoropyrimidine resistance in colorectal cancer as well as gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic
cancer, and the predictive value of microRNA expression
may be chemotherapy and/or tumor specific (21, 44).
As the prognostic and/or predictive value of microRNAs
might be dependent on the expression of more than one
microRNA, we performed cluster analysis using standardized
values of the seven microRNAs. However, no combination of
expression profiles of the seven microRNAs was found to be
prognostic or predictive (data not shown). Finally, in situ
hybridization was performed using specimens from this
cohort as well as specimens obtained from the University
of Maryland. Treatment conditions for microRNA in situ
hybridization vary per probe and histology. Conditions had
to be optimized using serial sections of an independent test
cohort for which qRT-PCR data was available. For the IALT
cases, a disadvantage was that we were completely blinded to
origin of cases, specimens being collected from a worldwide
multicenter study, with nonstandardized fixation and storage
conditions. Fixation and procurement variations all affect the
efficacy of in situ hybridization to a much bigger extent than
microRNA isolation and qRT-PCR (45, 46). Nevertheless, in
standardized test cases as well as IALT-Bio cases, in situ
expression of microRNAs could be shown.

In conclusion, many reports exist on microRNA expression
profiling and the prognostic and/or treatment predictive impact of microRNA expression in NSCLC. However, many studies
are limited by small sample size and by not being randomized.
This study constitutes the largest ever group of NSCLC patients
analyzed for the prognostic and predictive value of microRNA
expression. The seven target microRNAs chosen for evaluation,
miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a, were neither prognostic nor predictive in this patient cohort. Further
studies, for example, making use of a microRNA array approach,
are warranted in NSCLC, to identify the prognostic or predictive
value of expression of other microRNAs that were not included
in this study.
