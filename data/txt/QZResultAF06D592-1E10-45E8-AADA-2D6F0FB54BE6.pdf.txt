Abstract
The RET kinase has emerged as a promising target for the
therapy of medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) and of a subset
of papillary thyroid cancers. NVP-AST487, a N,N¶-diphenyl urea
with an IC50 of 0.88 Mmol/L on RET kinase, inhibited RET
autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors,
and potently inhibited the growth of human thyroid cancer cell
lines with activating mutations of RET but not of lines without
RET mutations. NVP-AST487 induced a dose-dependent
growth inhibition of xenografts of NIH3T3 cells expressing
oncogenic RET, and of the MTC cell line TT in nude mice. MTCs
secrete calcitonin, a useful indicator of tumor burden. Human
plasma calcitonin levels derived from the TT cell xenografts
were inhibited shortly after treatment, when tumor volume
was still unchanged, indicating that the effects of RET kinase
inhibition on calcitonin secretion were temporally dissociated
from its tumor-inhibitory properties. Accordingly, NVPAST487 inhibited calcitonin gene expression in vitro in TT
cells, in part, through decreased gene transcription. These data
point to a previously unknown physiologic role of RET
signaling on calcitonin gene expression. Indeed, the RET
ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin
mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487.
Antagonists of RET kinase activity in patients with MTC may
result in effects on plasma calcitonin that are either
disproportionate or dissociated from the effects on tumor
burden, because RET kinase mediates a physiologic pathway
controlling calcitonin secretion. The role of traditional tumor
biomarkers may need to be reassessed as targeted therapies
designed against oncoproteins with key roles in pathogenesis
are implemented. [Cancer Res 2007;67(14):6956–64]

(1), which in turn, bind to a family of GFRa (GDNF family receptor
a) coreceptors, consisting of four glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol–
anchored proteins, GFRa1–4, which form a complex with RET
tyrosine kinase. GFRa1–4 serve as preferential receptors for
GDNF, neurterin, artemin, and persephin, respectively (2). RET is
expressed in the developing central and peripheral nervous systems
and in the renal excretory system (3, 4). At days 8.5 to 9.5, RET
expression is restricted to neural crest cells, including those that
later give rise to the calcitonin-secreting C cells of the developing
thyroid gland (4). Among endocrine tissues, RET is also expressed
in the adrenal medulla (5).
Distinct germ line–activating mutations of RET confer predisposition to the major variants of multiple endocrine neoplasia type
2 (MEN2). MEN2A is primarily associated with mutations in Cys
residues in the extracellular domain of RET, leading to ligandindependent covalent dimerization and activation of the receptor,
and to predisposition to medullary thyroid cancers (MTC),
pheochromocytomas, and parathyroid hyperplasia. MEN2B is
associated with kinase domain mutations of RET, which results
in high penetrance of MTC with onset at an early age, neural
abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, and mucosal neuromas
(6). In addition to its role in the tumorigenesis of C cells and
adrenal medullary cells, the RET gene is activated by somatic
recombination events in papillary thyroid cancer (RET/PTC). The
function of RET has been studied extensively in vivo, and in various
cell types in vitro. RET is required for renal organogenesis and
enteric neurogenic development (7). RET signaling is also required
for the migration of sympathoadrenal neural crest cells, primarily
in response to the ligand artemin (8). Inappropriate RET activation
by mutations promotes cell survival in pheochromocytoma cells
(9), TSH-independent growth in thyroid follicular cells (10), and cell
proliferation and transformation in NIH3T3 cells (11).
The pathogenetic role of RET mutations in MTC and PTC has
generated interest in developing small molecule antagonists of RET
kinase activity. Molecules of various chemical structures have been
found to be effective RET kinase inhibitors (12). The pyrazolopyrimidines (PP1 and PP2; ref. 13), the indocarbazole derivatives,
CEP-701 and CEP-751 (14), and the 2-indolinone RPI-1 (15) exert
growth-inhibitory effects on the human MTC cell line TT in vitro
and, for many of these compounds, in MTC xenografts. The
quinazoline ZD6474 is also a potent RET inhibitor (16), and is
presently in clinical trials for patients with familial MTC associated
with germ line RET mutations.
Here, we report on the effects of a novel compound, NVPAST487, a N,N¶-diphenyl urea, which exhibits potent RET-inhibitory

Effect of RET Kinase Inhibition on Tumor Markers

activity in vitro and in vivo. Because plasma levels of calcitonin
are a useful marker of tumor burden in patients with MTC, we
monitored calcitonin levels in mice with MTC xenografts treated
with NVP-AST487 and observed that they dropped precipitously
prior to any effects on tumor mass. This led to the discovery of a
novel mechanism of regulation of calcitonin gene expression,
controlled by the ligand persephin via interaction with the
RET-GFRa coreceptor complex, and subject to direct inhibition
by RET kinase antagonists. Our findings also illustrate a potential
caveat of targeted therapies, which may independently modulate
the expression of tumor markers and compromise their usefulness
as indicators of tumor burden.

Materials and Methods
Materials. NVP-AST487-NX, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the
structure 1-[4-(4-ethyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl]-3-[4(6-methylamino-pyrimidin-4-yloxy)-phenyl]-urea was synthesized at
Novartis Pharma AG. For in vitro experiments, it was resuspended in
DMSO, and diluted with PBS. ZD6474 was kindly provided by Dr. Anderson
Ryan (Astra-Zeneca, Macclesfield, United Kingdom). The rat calcitonin
immunoradiometric (IRMA) kit was purchased from Immutopics, and the
human calcitonin ELISA was from MD Biosciences. Chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (CAT) ELISA was from Roche, the Steady-Glo luciferase
assay system was from Promega, whereas actinomycin D was from U.S.
Biochemical. GDNF, persephin, and recombinant rat GFRa1/Fc were from
R&D Systems, Inc.
Cell lines. The human thyroid carcinoma cell lines NPA, ARO, FRO, and
WRO were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. The
human papillary thyroid cancer cell line TPC-1 was maintained in DMEM
with 10% FCS. The human medullary carcinoma cell line TT was
maintained in DMEM/Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS.
MTC-M cells, a murine MTC line mouse thyroid cell line, was grown in
suspension in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% horse serum and 5% FCS.
PCCL3-RET/PTC3 cells are derived from the well differentiated, nontransformed rat thyroid cell line PCCL3 and conditionally express RET/
PTC3 in a doxycycline-dependent manner, and were propagated in H4
complete medium. NIH3T3-RETC634W stably express the indicated
activating point mutated RET oncoprotein.
Preparation of enzymes and kinase assays. Glutathione S-transferase
(GST)–fused kinase domains were expressed in baculovirus and purified
over glutathione-sepharose. Kinase activity was tested by measuring the
phosphorylation of a synthetic substrate [poly(Glu, Tyr)], by purified
GST-fusion kinase domains of the respective protein kinase in the presence of radiolabeled ATP; the ATP concentrations used were optimized
within the K m range for the individual kinases. Briefly, each kinase was
incubated under optimized buffer conditions in 20 mmol/L of Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 1 to 3 mmol/L of MnCl2, 3 to 10 mmol/L of MgCl2, 10 Amol/L
of Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L of DTT, 0.2 ACi [ 33P]ATP, 1 to 8 Amol/L of ATP,
3 to 8 Ag/mL of poly(Glu/Tyr, 4:1), and 1% DMSO in a total volume of
30 AL in the presence or absence of NVP-AST487 for 10 min at ambient
temperature. Reactions were terminated by adding 10 AL of 250 mmol/L
EDTA, and the reaction mixture was transferred onto an Immobilon
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Filters were washed
(0.5% H3PO4), soaked in ethanol, dried and counted in a liquid scintillation
counter. IC50s for NVP-AST487 were calculated by linear regression analysis
of the percentage inhibition.
Athymic mouse TT cell xenografts. Female athymic nude mice were
kept under optimized hygienic conditions (maximum of 10 mice per
Makrolon type III cage) with free access to food and water. Tumors were
established by s.c. injection of 1  106 and 5  106 of NIH3T3-RETC634W
and TT cells, respectively, in 100 AL of HBSS per mouse. Treatable tumors,
i.e., mean tumor volume of f100 mm3, developed within 10 days of
NIH3T3-RETC634W cell injection, and within 20 days of TT cell injection.
NVP-AST487 was given p.o., once daily by gavage. The compound was

formulated by dissolving the appropriate amount of powder in
N-methylpyrrolidone/PEG300 (1:10 v/v). The mice were randomized into
four treatment groups of eight mice each. The first three groups received
daily oral administrations of NVP-AST487 at 50, 30, and 10 mg/kg,
respectively, for 3 weeks. The fourth group received treatment with vehicle.
Tumor growth and body weights were monitored twice weekly. Tumor
volumes were determined according to the formula: length  diameter2 
k/6. Tumors were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen at the end of the
efficacy study, 6 h after the last administration.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mmol/L
of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mmol/L of EDTA, 150 mmol/L of NaCl, 0.5%
Triton-X, 50 mmol/L of NaF, 10 mmol/L of Na-PPi, 2 mmol/L of
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mmol/L of sodium orthovanadate,
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The tumor tissues were homogenized at 4jC for 15 s in 10 volumes of lysis buffer using an Ultra-Turrax
(Model T25). The lysis buffer was composed of 50 mmol/L of Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L of EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L of NaCl,
1 mmol/L of PMSF, 80 Ag/mL of aprotinin, 50 Ag/mL of leupeptin, and
200 Amol/L of sodium orthovanadate. Following 30 min of incubation on
ice, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant collected
and stored at 70jC. Before freezing, a sample aliquot was diluted at
1:2,000 in water for determination of the protein concentration with a
commercially available protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as
standard (Pierce).
Sixty micrograms of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and
blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used:
anti–phospho-ERK, anti-ERK1 K-23, anti-PLCg (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-RET (Yuri Nikiforov, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH), or
polyclonal rabbit anti-RET (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p905-RET
and anti-p783 PLCg (Cell Signaling). The antigen-antibody complexes were
visualized using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit
IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence
system (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was stripped using a
Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce), and reprobed several times.
For quantitation, gel images were captured using a Kodak image station and
band density was determined using a one-dimensional image analysis
software.
RET immunoprecipitation. Washed cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer
containing 50 mmol/L of HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L of NaCl, 25 mmol/L
of h-glycerophosphate, 25 mmol/L of NaF, 5 mmol/L of EGTA, 1 mmol/L of
EDTA, 15 mmol/L of Na-PPi, 2 mmol/L of sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmol/L
of sodium molybdate, leupeptin (10 Ag/mL), aprotinin (10 Ag/mL), 1 mmol/L
of DTT, 1 mmol/L of PMSF, and 1% NP40. Protease inhibitors and NP40 were
purchased from Sigma. Extracts were homogenized, cleared by centrifugation, aliquoted, and frozen at 70jC. Total protein (500 Ag; Bio-Rad protein
assay reagent) was immunoprecipitated with 1 Ag of RET-specific antibody
(C-19), and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Total tyrosine phosphorylation was
assessed with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Cell Signaling).
The membrane was stripped and reprobed with the antiphosphotyrosine
1062 RET antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). RET protein levels were
controlled by direct Western blots using C-19. Decorated proteins were
revealed as above.
Northern blot analysis and real-time reverse transcription-PCR.
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation) and
6 to 10 Ag RNA samples were resolved by formaldehyde agarose gel
electrophoresis in HEPES buffer, transferred to nylon membranes, crosslinked by UV irradiation, and hybridized. The following probes were used:
mouse calcitonin 0.8 kb cDNA probe, a 0.9 kb human calcitonin cDNA
probe, a 682 bp human carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA) cDNA
constructed using the following primers: (5¶-TCCTCTATGGCCCAGACGAC-3¶ and 5¶-TGTGTGTGTTGCTGCGGTATC-3¶) or a 1.1 kb human cyclin
D1 cDNA. Probes were labeled by random priming using the Prime II kit
(Stratagene). After washing, signal intensity was quantitated by phosphorimaging and analyzed using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) image
analysis software. Blots were standardized by either ethidium bromide

staining of 18S and 28S rRNAs, or by hybridization with a mouse h-actin
cDNA probe. Additional experiments looking at the effects of NVPAST487, 4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo-[3,4-d]-pyrimidine (PP2) or ZD6474 on calcitonin or calcitonin gene–related peptide
(CGRP) mRNA levels were done by real-time reverse transcription-PCR.
Primer set 1 amplified a fragment bracketing exons 2 and 3, which is
common to both calcitonin and CGRP. Primer set 2 amplified a fragment
spanning exons 3 and 4, which was specific to CGRP. Primers are available
upon request.
Sequencing of mouse RET cDNA from MTC-M cells. The sequence
of RET cDNA from MTC-M cells was determined by reverse transcriptionPCR, using overlapping primers spanning nucleotides 139 to 3,265. The
only substitution leading to an amino acid change was a TCC (serine) to
TTC (phenylalanine) at codon 520. This is likely a polymorphism because
some of the mouse RET sequences present in the Genbank contain a
serine (accession no. NM_009050, X67812, or 19713) whereas others
(accession no. BC059012, AF209436, AY326397, or NC_000072) contain a
phenylalanine.
Calcitonin immunoassays. Human calcitonin was assayed from serum
of athymic mice with TT cell tumor xenografts and from TT cell–
conditioned media by ELISA (MD Biosciences). Fluorescence was measured
in a FLUOstar OPTIMA Platereader (BMG). Calcitonin levels in the plasma
of wild-type mice were measured in an IRMA kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Immutopics).
Transient transfection assays. Plasmid DNAs were prepared using
commercial kits (Bio-Rad). TT cells were cultured to 70% confluence in
six-well plates. The CAT reporter plasmids, pCT132CAT and pCT252CAT,
were a gift from Dr. Barry Nelkin (Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive
Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore,
MD), and pGL3-control was purchased from Promega. For each well,
2.4 Ag of plasmid DNA (2 Ag of reporter and 0.4 Ag of pGL3-control)
were mixed together and incubated at room temperature for 15 min with
20 AL of LipofectAMINE Plus and 5.0 AL of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen).
Plates were washed with serum-free medium and then incubated at
37jC for 5 h with the transfection solution, after which time, medium
was changed to growth medium. Cells were then left untreated or were
treated with 100 nmol/L of NVP-AST487 for 48 h. CAT assays were
carried out using CAT ELISA and measured by FLUOstar OPTIMA Plate
Reader. Luciferase assays were carried out using steady-Glo luciferase
assay system and activities were measured by Top count (Packard).
The CAT activity (mean F SE) was calculated as picograms per microgram of protein and normalized by luciferase activity. All experiments
were done by triplicate and repeated thrice. The protein concentration
was measured using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce
Chemical, Co.).
Statistical analyses. Data were compared by t test or by ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni t test. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. IC50 was
calculated with PRISM software.

Results
In vitro selectivity of NVP-AST487 and oral bioavailability.
NVP-AST487, a novel RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the N,N¶diphenyl urea class, inhibited the ICD of the RET kinase with an
IC50 of 0.88 Amol/L (Table 1). A number of other kinases were also
similarly inhibited by NVP-AST487 in the in vitro kinase assays,
including KDR, Flt-4, Flt-3, c-Kit, and c-Abl. Additionally, data
derived from a panel of Baf3 murine pro–B cell lymphoma lines
rendered growth factor–independent by transduction with various
activated tyrosine kinases, suggested cellular specificity for RETdriven proliferation (IC50 for PTC3-RET–driven Baf3 cells, 34 F
4 nmol/L), with activity against FLT3 as well, and to a lesser extent,
Bcr-ABL–dependent proliferation (data not shown). After a single
oral administration of 15 mg/kg of NVP-AST487 to OF1 mice, a
mean peak plasma level (C max) of 0.505 F 0.078 Amol/L SE was

achieved after 0.5 h. Similar levels of NVP-AST487 were found in
the plasma of mice up to 6 h after oral administration, with a
C last of 0.021 F 0.004 Amol/L at 24 h. The oral bioavailability was
calculated to be 9.7% with a t 1/2 terminal elimination of 1.5 h.
NVP-AST487 inhibits RET autophosphorylation and activation of PLC; and ERK. We examined the effects of NVP-AST487
on RET autophosphorylation and signaling in PC-RET/PTC3 cells
and in TT cells. PC-RET/PTC3 thyroid cells express oncogenic
RET/PTC3 in a doxycycline-inducible manner. Induction of RET/
PTC3 by treatment with doxycycline for 24 h was associated with
autophosphorylation at RETY905, which was decreased by NVPAST487 in a dose-dependent manner (5–60 nmol/L). A similar
profile of inhibitory activity was seen on pPLCg and pERK
(Fig. 1A). The effects of NVP-AST487 were also examined in TT
cells, which harbor an endogenous activating point mutation
of RET (RETC634W). NVP-AST487 inhibited autophosphorylation
in RET immunoprecipitates as determined by Western blotting
with antibodies to pRETY1062 or to total phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1B).
The potency of NVP-AST487 on RET activity in PCCL3 or TT cells
was >20-fold greater than that observed in the in vitro kinase
assays.
NVP-AST487 inhibits the growth of human thyroid cancer
cell lines with RET, but not BRAF mutations. We tested the
effects of NVP-AST487 on the growth of human thyroid cancer cell
lines known to harbor activating mutations of the following
oncogenes: (a) RET: TPC-1 (RET/PTC1) and TT (RETC634W ; ref. 17);
(b) BRAFT1796A : NPA, ARO, and FRO (18, 19). We also tested its
effects on WRO, which have no known mutation of TK receptors,
RAS or BRAF. IC50 for growth for TT and TPC-1 cells was 7.2 and
f5 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A). By contrast, the compound had
no effect on the growth of cell lines with the BRAF mutation or on
WRO cells (Fig. 2B). These data support the selectivity of the
compound for RET (relative to RAF), and suggest that the growth of
PTC and MTC cells requires RET kinase activity.

oncogenic RET in vivo. NVP-AST487 given p.o. evoked a dosedependent inhibition of growth of NIH3T3-RETC634W xenografts,

Effect of RET Kinase Inhibition on Tumor Markers

Figure 1. NVP-AST487 inhibits RET autophosphorylation and downstream signaling. A, Western blots of PC-PTC3 lysates from cells incubated with or without
doxycycline for 24 h in the presence or absence of the indicated concentration of NVP-AST487. Both compounds were added simultaneously. Incubation with 1 Ag/mL of
doxycycline results in the induction of RET/PTC3 expression and autophosphorylation of RET as determined by a phosphospecific antibody to RETY905. Preincubation
with NVP-AST487 induced a dose-dependent reduction in phosphorylation at RETY905, as well as of PLCg and ERK. B, Western blots of RET immunoprecipitates from
TT cell extracts derived from cells incubated with the indicated concentrations of NVP-AST487 for 90 min. Blots were probed for total phosphotyrosine content (pTyrosine ) or phosphorylation of RET on tyrosine 1062 [p-RET(Y1062) ]. RET protein levels were analyzed by direct Western blot (RET ). Incubation with NVP-AST487
induced a dose-dependent reduction in RET phosphorylation.

with doses >30 mg/kg/d causing significant reductions in tumor
size (Fig. 3A). The effects of the compound on RET expression and
phosphorylation in tumor extracts was analyzed 6 h following
the final treatment (Fig. 3B). Reductions in tumor RET phosphorylation in NVP-AST487–treated animals were clearly seen,

particularly at doses z30 mg/kg. Interestingly, there was also a
dose-dependent decrease of RET expression, with one of three
tumors analyzed in the 30 mg/kg group and three of three tumors
in the 50 mg/kg group showing a dramatic reduction in RET
protein levels.

Figure 3. NVP-AST487 inhibits the growth of NIH3T3-RETC634W xenografts
in athymic nude mice. A, female athymic nude mice were s.c. injected with
1  106 of NIH3T3-RETC634W cells and treatable tumors (f100 mm3)
developed after 1 wk. Mice were treated with the indicated dose of drug or
vehicle daily by gavage. Tumor growth and body weight were monitored twice
weekly. Tumor volumes were determined according to the formula: length 
diameter2  k/6. *, P < 0.05, statistically significant change in tumor volume
versus controls (ANOVA). B, Western blot analysis for phosphorylated
(tyrosine 509, p-tyrosine ) and total RET protein in NIH3T3-RETC634W
tumors harvested 6 h following the final treatment.

In our hands, TPC-1 cells did not grow as readily as xenografts.
Hence, in vivo experiments to test the effects of NVP-AST487 were
done exclusively on TT cells. The data in Fig. 4A show that oral
administration of NVP-AST487 at 50 or 30 mg/kg/d decreased
mean tumor volume as compared with control mice (P < 0.001
ANOVA). These data were replicated in two additional efficacy
experiments. Treatment of athymic mice was not associated with
significant body weight change of the animals at any of the
concentrations tested.
A notable finding from these experiments was that the plasma
levels of human calcitonin, which were measured as a biomarker of
tumor responsiveness to NVP-AST487, seemed to decrease prior to
any changes in tumor volume. As shown in Fig. 4B, plasma
calcitonin levels measured 96 h after a single oral administration of
50 mg/kg of NVP-AST487 were markedly decreased, at a time when
tumor volume was still unchanged. This difference was statistically
significant when the calcitonin concentrations were normalized to
the tumor weight (P < 0.05; t test), but not when absolute values
were analyzed (P = 0.083).
NVP-AST487 directly inhibits calcitonin gene expression,
independent of effects on TT cell growth. We next examined
the effects of NVP-AST487 on calcitonin gene expression in vitro. As

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

shown in Fig. 5A, treatment of TT cells with 100 nmol/L of
NVP-AST487 was associated with an f50% decrease in calcitonin
mRNA after 96 h. The quantification of this effect in three
independent biological replicates is shown as supplemental data.
The delayed response to the compound is likely due to the
prolonged half-life of calcitonin mRNA, as inhibition of nascent
transcription by treatment with actinomycin D resulted in a very
modest decay of mature calcitonin mRNA over a 24 h incubation
(supplemental data), which is consistent with the previously
reported t 1/2 of calcitonin mRNA in TT cells (20). Calcitonin
secretion into conditioned media was markedly inhibited by NVPAST487 in a concentration-dependent fashion, with maximal
effects observed at 50 to 100 nmol/L (Fig. 5B). Besides calcitonin,
MTC cells also secrete CEA, which is also a valuable tumor marker.
NVP-AST487 had no effect on CEA mRNA levels (supplemental
data). To determine whether NVP-AST487 inhibited calcitonin gene
transcription, we transiently transfected TT cells with the calcitonin
promoter plasmid, pCT252CAT, the activity of which is induced by
RAS in these cells (21). Treatment with 100 nmol/L of NVP-AST487
resulted in a 3-fold inhibition of promoter activity after 48 h. The
pCT132 promoter fragment that lacks the domain conferring
responsiveness to RAS also seemed to be inhibited by the kinase
inhibitor (Fig. 5C). The effects of NVP-AST487 were unlikely to be
due to off-target actions because PP2 and ZD6474, compounds
previously shown to inhibit RET kinase activity (16, 22), also
markedly decreased calcitonin mRNA levels in TT cells after
72 h (Fig. 5D). All three compounds inhibited CGRP mRNA to a
comparable level. This is consistent with an effect on the
abundance of the primary CTN/CGRP transcript rather than
through regulation of alternative splicing of the gene.
Persephin and GDNF induce calcitonin gene expression in
MTC-M cells. As calcitonin gene expression is inhibited by the RET
kinase antagonist NVP-AST487, we next examined whether the
converse is also the case, i.e., whether ligand-induced RET
activation induces calcitonin mRNA levels. To this end, we used
the mouse medullary thyroid cancer cell line, MTC-M, which was
shown to have a wild-type sequence (see Materials and Methods).
MTC-M cells were treated with GDNF in the presence or
absence of recombinant rat GFRa1/Fc chimeric protein, which
binds GDNF in solution and activates RET kinase (23). GDNF
alone evoked only a faint induction of calcitonin mRNA (data not
shown); however, in the presence of GFRa1, GDNF induced a
marked increase in calcitonin mRNA levels (Fig. 6A). By contrast
to GDNF, treatment of cells with persephin alone induced
calcitonin mRNA (Fig. 6B and C), which was only modestly
augmented by coincubation with GFRa1 (data not shown). Both
GDNF/GFRa1 and persephin-induced calcitonin mRNA were
markedly inhibited by coincubation with 100 nmol/L of NVPAST487 (Fig. 6B). The CTN/CGRP gene has been shown to be
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–responsive. Accordingly, the MEK inhibitor UO126 also inhibited persephin-induced
calcitonin mRNA levels (Fig. 6C).
NVP-AST487 inhibits plasma calcitonin levels in mice.
We next examined the effects of NVP-AST487 administered at
50 mg/kg/d by gavage on plasma murine calcitonin levels in FVBN wild-type mice. As shown in Fig. 7, plasma calcitonin levels
decreased rapidly, and were significantly lower than controls by 8 h
after administration of a single dose p.o. (Fig. 7A). Levels
remained significantly lower than vehicle-treated controls up to
72 h (Fig. 7B). There was no corresponding decrease in thyroid
tissue calcitonin mRNA at these time points (data not shown),

suggesting that at least part of the inhibitory effects of NVPAST487 in vivo are posttranscriptional.

Discussion
Some of the most striking early successes of targeted cancer
therapies with kinase inhibitors have been with compounds that

block the activity of oncoproteins that are involved in the early
stages of tumor development, and which are believed to be
required for the continued viability of the neoplastic clone. BCRABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia and KIT in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors meet these criteria, and likely account for the
sensitivity of these cancers to imatinib, which effectively inhibits

the activity of these kinases in human cancers. The fact that
activating mutations of RET are present in the germ line of
almost all patients with familial forms of MTC indicates that
this oncogene is a very early event in the development of these
cancers. Moreover, the requirement for continued activity of
RET for MTC progression is suggested by evidence that orthotopic thyroidal injection of adenoviral vectors directing the
expression of a dominant-negative RET kinase antagonist impairs
the growth of MTC in a transgenic mouse line with C cell–
specific expression of oncogenic RET (24). Familial MTCs may
represent the cancer type in which the key event in tumor
initiation is best established, and might thus be a good paradigm
in which to test the hypothesis that cancers remain dependent on
the continued unregulated activation of a tumor-initiating event
for their growth or survival.
This potential has not escaped the attention of other
investigators. Several groups have characterized compounds with
inhibitory activity on RET kinase (reviewed in ref. 12). One of them
in particular, the quinazoline ZD6474, was found to have an
IC50 for GST-RET/TK of f130 nmol/L. This compound inhibited
the activity of most of the common oncogenic mutants of RET,
including the RET/PTC fusion genes involved in the development
of papillary thyroid cancers, with the notable exception of
RETV804M. This particular substitution corresponds to residues in
ABL, EGFR, and PDGFR, which have been shown to mediate

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

resistance to various kinase inhibitors (25). ZD6474 is presently in
phase 2 clinical trials for familial MTC, the results of which have
not yet been published.
Here, we report the characterization of a novel compound that is
structurally distinct from other RET kinase inhibitors. NVP-AST487
exhibits a potent growth-inhibitory effect in RET-dependent Baf3
cells, and in TT and TPC-1 cells, derived, respectively, from a MTC
and PTC harboring activating RET mutations. By contrast, the
compound had no effect on other thyroid cancer cell lines, most of
which had activating mutations of BRAF. The selectivity of action
of NVP-AST487 on thyroid cancer cell lines with RET mutations
argues for the requirement of RET kinase activity for their
continued viability.
There was a noticeable difference in the inhibitory activity of the
compound in vitro, in which the IC50 was 0.88 Amol/L, as compared
with cells in which the compound was at least 10-fold more potent.
There are several potential explanations for this. First, the two
assays of RET activity are distinct: in vitro, we assayed the ability of
a GST-RET fusion protein to phosphorylate a substrate, whereas in
cells we measured RET autophosphorylation by Western blotting.
Concentrations of ATP, the binding competitor for NVP-AST487,
may be quite different in these two settings, which could be critical.
Moreover, NVP-AST487 is predicted to bind to RET in its inactive
conformation, which is more likely to occur in whole cells than in
the GST fusion protein in vitro. The inhibitory effects of the
compound on other kinases, such as Abl, may also contribute to
the greater potency of NVP-AST487 in blocking the growth of
thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET, particularly as
RET-induced Abl activation mediates phosphorylation of the
MAPK protein Erk8 (26).
Calcitonin belongs to a family of structurally related but
biologically distinct molecules that includes calcitonin itself, its
splice variant CGRP, amylin, and adrenomedulin. The calcitonin
gene family consists of four genes (CALC-I to CALC-IV ). Calcitonin
and its splice variant CGRP-1 are differentially spliced products of
CALC-I in C cells and neuronal cells, respectively. Plasma calcium
concentration is a primary physiologic stimulus of calcitonin
secretion in thyroid parafollicular C cells, an effect that is mediated

Effect of RET Kinase Inhibition on Tumor Markers

through the calcium-sensing receptor (27). Other than its
regulation via calcium sensing, calcitonin gene expression in C
cells also responds to peptide hormones. The gastrointestinal
hormone gastrin induces rapid calcitonin secretion as well as
gene transcription in TT cells, acting via the G protein–coupled
cholecystokinin 2 receptor (CCK2R; ref. 28), which may explain
the brisk calcitonin response to pentagastrin seen in patients with
MTC. There are indications that CCK2R is also expressed in normal
parafollicular C cells (29). Glucagon-like peptide I also induces
calcitonin mRNA in rat MTC cells (30).
The inhibition of human calcitonin secretion from TT cell
xenografts by NVP-AST487 in vivo is consistent with a direct effect
of the compound on calcitonin gene expression, in all likelihood,
through the inhibition of RET kinase activity. Several lines of
evidence substantiate this interpretation of the data. NVP-AST487
inhibits calcitonin mRNA abundance in TT cells in vitro. The
relatively slow kinetics of calcitonin mRNA decay may be due to
the previously reported prolonged t 1/2 of the transcript (20), which
we confirmed. NVP-AST487 inhibited calcitonin gene transcription
directed by a CT promoter fragment that contained an element
previously reported to be activated via RAS (21). As RET activates
RAS and MAPK, it is possible that this pathway may be a primary
driver of calcitonin gene transcription. Clearly, other factors
contribute significantly to calcitonin gene regulation, which can
also be activated through cyclic AMP (31, 32). The evidence that
RET kinase inhibition blocked calcitonin gene expression led us to
explore the hypothesis that ligand-induced RET activation resulted
in a reciprocal effect. To this end, it was critical to identify a C cell
line that expressed wild-type RET because activated mutants of
this tyrosine kinase receptor oncogene are either constitutively
fully active or show attenuated responses to ligand. The mouse
MTC-M cell line was found to express a wild-type RET gene
product, and was thus suitable for these experiments. Treatment of
these cells with GDNF alone elicited no response, consistent with
the notion that GDNF may not be the natural ligand for RET in C
cells, as they do not express GFRa1, the coreceptor for GDNF, but
instead preferentially express GFRa4, which is the binding receptor
for persephin (33). Indeed, costimulation of MTC-M cells with both
GDNF and a soluble form of GFRa1 robustly induced calcitonin
mRNA levels. By contrast, treatment with persephin alone was
sufficient to stimulate calcitonin gene expression. RET kinase
activity was required for ligand-induced calcitonin gene expression
because it was blocked by NVP-AST487. Moreover, the contribution of MAPK activity to persephin-induced calcitonin gene

expression was found to be significant because the effects were
partially blocked by UO126.
While our study was being written, Lindfors et al. reported the
phenotype of mice with ablation of the persephin coreceptor
GFRa4 gene (34). These animals had a normal number of C cells
with apparently preserved morphology, but had decreased calcitonin content in the thyroid of neonates and young animals.
Although calcitonin content in the thyroid returned to normal in
adult animals, these data point to a physiologic requirement for
signaling via GFRa4-RET for calcitonin gene expression in C cells.
Further evidence that this novel calcitonin regulatory pathway is
physiologic is provided by our observation that NVP-AST487
markedly reduced plasma calcitonin levels in normal mice.
Oral administration of NVP-AST487 was associated with a
significant decline in plasma calcitonin levels at 8 h. A similar early
drop in plasma human calcitonin was seen in athymic mice with
TT cell xenografted tumors (data not shown). In view of the
prolonged t 1/2 of calcitonin mRNA, this suggests that RET signaling
may be mediating distinct effects on calcitonin secretion and gene
expression. Although the former mechanism remains to be proven,
a dual mechanism of regulation of calcitonin gene expression and
secretion by gastrin has also been proposed (28).
The findings reported here are of potential clinical significance
because plasma calcitonin is used routinely as an indicator of
progression in patients with persistent or recurrent MTC, as it is
believed to be roughly proportional to tumor mass. Now that
small-molecule RET kinase inhibitors are being evaluated for
therapeutic effectiveness in patients with metastatic MTC, our
data raises the possibility that measurement of calcitonin may not
accurately reflect tumor burden in these patients. On the other
hand, evidence of a rapid decrease in calcitonin levels after shortterm treatment with a RET kinase inhibitor may provide indirect
evidence that the kinase has been effectively targeted. In a larger
context, these data point to the need to reappraise the
performance of tumor biomarkers when new therapies are being
tested, particularly when they are directed against cellular targets
believed to be of pathogenetic significance.
