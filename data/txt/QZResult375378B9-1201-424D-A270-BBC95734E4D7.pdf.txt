BACKGROUND: Nilotinib is active in imatinib-resistant and -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia patients and was
recently approved for these indications. METHODS: Data on the efficacy and safety of nilotinib treatment were
collected from 2 phase 2 expanded access clinical trials with similar designs (CAMN107AIL01 and ENACT). RESULTS:
Of 88 study patients (58 chronic, 11 accelerated, 19 blast crisis), the best responses to nilotinib were complete hematologic response (CHR) in 27%, partial cytogenetic response in 12%, complete cytogenetic response in 14%, and major
molecular response in 19%. Patients achieving at least a CHR during imatinib therapy were more likely to respond to
nilotinib, and failure to achieve at least a CHR on imatinib therapy was predictive of progression or lack of response
to nilotinib (P ¼ .0021). Responses were not statistically different in subgroup analysis, including that of imatinib intolerance compared with imatinib resistance, presence of ABL kinase domain mutations compared with absence of
mutations, and previous treatment with another second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor compared no prior
treatment. The overall survival and progression-free survival rates at 1 year were 83% and 48% for the entire cohort,
93% and 66% in chronic phase, and 64% and 19% in advanced phase. Adverse hematological events included
thrombocytopenia (all events, 27%; grade 3-4, 13%) and leukopenia (all events, 18%; grade 3-4, 10%). The majority of
the nonhematological events were mild, the most common being rash, infection, bone pain, headache, nausea, and
vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib treatment is an efficient and safe therapy for imatinib-resistant or -intolerant
patients. Prior response to imatinib therapy is a predictor for the response to nilotinib. Cancer 2010;116:4564–72.

KEYWORDS: chronic myeloid leukemia, nilotinib, imatinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, response prediction.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an underlying balanced

chromosomal translocation, t(9;22)the Philadelphia chromosome, which generates the BCR-ABL fusion proteina
tyrosine kinase with enhanced activity. Although treatment with imatinib has changed the current management of CML
drastically, discontinuation of treatment may occur in 14% of chronic phase patients because of resistance and in 5%
because of toxicity.1 Discontinuation of therapy is even more frequent in the advanced phases of the disease. A variety of
mechanisms underlying treatment resistance were identified in the past, including mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain, amplification of the Philadelphia chromosome, and clonal evolution.2 This has led to the design of more potent second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor intended to overcome resistance. The second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor
nilotinib (Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) is an aminopyrimidine derivative of imatinib with an increased binding affinity to
the chimeric p210 BCR-ABL. Nilotinib is active in Philadelphia-positive CML both in vitro3,4 and in clinical studies of
imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients in chronic phase, accelerated phase (AP), and blast crisis (BC) CML.5-8 It was
recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of
imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML patients9 in chronic and accelerated phases. Additional information regarding the
efficacy and safety of nilotinib can be gained from expanded access trials that incorporate in their design aspects learned

from the initial phase 2 trials, and are aimed at treating
broader populations. Here we report data from a combined cohort of 2 expanded access clinical trials of therapy
with nilotinib in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML
patients in all clinical disease phases, ENACT (Expanding
Nilotinib Access in Clinical Trials) and CAMN107AIL01
(ClinicalTrials.gov numbers NCT00302016 and
NCT00264160, respectively).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CML patients 18 years old with resistance or intolerance
to imatinib therapy were included in the study. Resistance
or intolerance to a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor was an additional inclusion criterion in the CAMN107AIL01 protocol. To define imatinib resistance,
patients had to be treated with at least 600 mg imatinib
daily or with the highest tolerated dose. Patients developing an ABL kinase domain mutation during imatinib
therapy with an intermediate imatinib sensitivity (L248,
G250, Q252, F317, and H396) or with an in vitro insensitivity to imatinib (Y253, E255, and T315)10 were eligible for the trial even if treated with an imatinib dose of
<600 mg/d.
Imatinib resistance in chronic phase was defined as a
failure to obtain a complete hematologic response (CHR)
after 3 months of imatinib therapy or a loss of a CHR, a
failure to achieve a minimal cytogenetic response after 6
months of imatinib therapy or a loss of a minimal cytogenetic response, a failure to achieve a major cytogenetic
response after 12 months of imatinib therapy or a loss of a
major cytogenetic response, cytogenetic progression
defined as an increase of 30% in bone marrow Philadelphiaþ metaphases, or a clonal evolution during therapy
with imatinib.
Imatinib resistance in AP and BC was defined as disease progression from chronic phase to an AP or BC or
from AP to BC during imatinib therapy, persistent disease
for 2 weeks during imatinib therapy for BC, disease progression during imatinib therapy (an increase of 50% in
peripheral white blood cell, basophil, blast, or platelet
count), or a lack of a bone marrow response after 4 weeks
of imatinib therapy.
Imatinib intolerance was defined as the development of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of any duration or
grade 2 adverse events persisting for 1 month despite
optimal supportive care.

ance status of 2. Patients with active central nervous
system (CNS) disease were excluded from the study.
The study was approved by the local institutional
review board committees according to the declaration of
Helsinki, and all patients gave their informed consent.
ABL Kinase Domain Mutation Analysis
Screening for ABL kinase domain mutation was required
at entry to CAMN107AIL01 and optional for patients
included in the ENACT trial, and was done by direct
sequencing or using a chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight mass spectrometer with specific
primers designed for each mutation site.11
Study Population
Our analysis includes data from 2 cohorts of patients with
similar study designs. Patients from the ENACT trial, a
multicenter international trial conducted in Europe, were
recruited from Germany (3 centers), Poland, and Greece
between November 2006 and March 2008. CAMN107AIL01 patients were recruited in Israel from 3 participating centers between June 2006 and December
2007. The Data reported in this article were collected into
a common datasheet and analyzed together.
Study Design and Treatment
Nilotinib was administered at a dose of 400 mg twice
daily for a treatment duration of 12 months or until study
withdrawal. The dose was reduced to 400 mg daily in
patients experiencing a grade 3 nonhematological toxicity or grade 3 hematological toxicity recovering between
14 and 42 days. Patients with recurring grade 3 nonhematological toxicities or a grade 3 hematological toxicity
recovering after 42 days were withdrawn from the study.
Other reasons for study discontinuation included unsatisfactory therapeutic response, intolerable toxicity, protocol
violation, withdrawal of consent, and death. Responding
patients were maintained on therapy after the end of the
study until the approval of nilotinib in their respective
countries. Follow-up of patients who were withdrawn
from the trial was done until 30 days after the last nilotinib dose; extended follow-up data for the patients continuing therapy with nilotinib are included in this report.
Dose escalation was not allowed.
Study Objectives
The study objectives were safety (ENACT) and both
safety and efficacy in the CAMN107AIL01 trial as

assessed by the rates of hematological, cytogenetic and
molecular responses within the study period.
Responses were defined according to O’Brien et al
for chronic phase,12 Talpaz et al for AP13 and Sawyers et
al for BC14 patients. Adverse events were defined and
graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 3.0.
Statistical Analysis
Response rates were calculated as percentages from the respective populations of patients. Rates of CHR, partial
cytogenetic response, complete cytogenetic response,
major cytogenetic response (partial cytogenetic response
þ complete cytogenetic response), and major molecular
response were compared between subgroups using a chisquare analysis. Survival curves were done using the
Kaplan-Meier method.

RESULTS
A total of 88 patients from 8 centers (ENACT, 54; CAMN107AIL01, 34) are included in this analysis; their baseline features are shown in Table 1. The median follow-up
duration was 445 days (range, 34-1000 days), and the
mean treatment duration was 273 days (range, 1-954
days).
Fifty-eight (66%) patients were included in the
study in chronic phase, 11 (12%) in AP, and 19 (22%) in
BC. Imatinib resistance was the reason for inclusion for
66 (75%) patients and intolerance for 22 (25%). At the
time of data analysis, 28 patients had completed the study,
and 21 were on therapy within the study. Thirty-nine
patients had discontinued therapy because of disease progression/lack of response (n ¼ 20), side effects (n ¼ 11),
stem cell transplantation (SCT) (n ¼ 3), and other reasons
(n ¼ 5).
Efficacy
Response rates are shown in Figure 1 for the whole group,
and Table 2 shows the responses to nilotinib according to
the disease phase at study inclusion. The best responses to
nilotinib were CHR in 23 (27%), partial cytogenetic
response in 10 (12%), complete cytogenetic response in
12 (14%), and major molecular response in 16 (19%)
patients. An additional 15 (18%) patients had stable disease during treatment with imatinib, and 1 advanced
phase patient returned to chronic phase. CHR was newly
achieved in 40 (66%), major cytogenetic response in 30
(43%), and major molecular response in 16 (20%)
patients not having those responses at study entry (Fig.

response in the responding patients was 150 days (range,
20-421 days).
Response rates were lower in imatinib-resistant
compared with imatinib-intolerant patients, and were
61% and 75% for a CHR, 36% and 50% for a partial
cytogenetic response, 29% and 47% for a complete cytogenetic response, and 16% and 33% for a major molecular response in imatinib-resistant and -intolerant patients,
respectively. These differences, however, were not statistically different (P ¼ .54, .48, .22, and .18, respectively),
presumably because of the small number of patients in
each subgroup (Fig. 1B). There was no difference in

ther did not respond to therapy or their response is not
known. Furthermore, of the patients with a prior major
cytogenetic response to imatinib, 70% have achieved a
major cytogenetic response or better to nilotinib, and
10% have maintained their previously achieved response,
whereas only 17% have achieved only a CHR during nilotinib therapy, and 3% of patients progressed.
For the purpose of survival analysis, the data for
patients in AP and BC were analyzed together as advanced
phase disease. The median overall survival was 914 days in
chronic phase and 727 days in advanced phase disease
(Fig. 2A), and has not yet been reached for patients with
imatinib intolerance compared with 914 days for imatinib-resistant patients (P ¼ .15) (Fig. 2B). The median
progression-free survival was not reached in chronic phase
and was 120 days in advanced phase disease (Fig. 2C),
and was significantly better in imatinib-intolerant compared with imatinib-resistant patients (not reached compared with 319 days; P ¼ .028; 95% confidence interval,
1.102-5.380) (Fig. 2D). The overall survival rates at 1
year were 83% for the entire cohort, 93% for chronic
phase patients, and 64% for patients in advanced phase,
and the progression-free survival rates at 1 year were 48%,
66%, and 19%, respectively.

response rates between patients with and without additional cytogenetic abnormalities at study entry (Table 2).
The achievement of at least a CHR during imatinib
therapy was predictive of a subsequent response to nilotinib, whereas a failure to achieve at least a CHR on imatinib therapy was predictive of progression or lack of
response to nilotinib therapy. Seventy percent of patients
whose best response to imatinib was a CHR achieved at
least a CHR to nilotinib, whereas 60% of patients without
a CHR on imatinib did not achieve at least a CHR on
nilotinib (P ¼ .0021). Of patients with a CHR as best
response to imatinib, 40% had a CHR as their best
response to nilotinib, whereas 15% maintained a previously achieved CHR, and 30% achieved at least a major
cytogenetic response. The remaining 15% of patients ei-

Prior Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy
Nilotinib therapy was commenced in 16 (18%) patients
after failure or intolerance in response to another second
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor in 6 and 8 patients,
respectively, and for an unknown reason in 2. The prior
tyrosine kinase inhibitor was dasatinib in 14 patients,
bosutinib in 1 (this patient was also treated with dasatinib), and INNO 406 in 1. Response rates in this subgroup
were not significantly different compared with responses
in patients without prior therapy with another tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Table 2). There was no significant difference in responses between patients with a prior second
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor failure compared
with patients showing prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor
intolerance (P ¼ .28, data not shown).
Baseline ABL Kinase Domain Mutations
Twenty (26%) patients had 22 ABL kinase domain mutations at study entry; their best responses are shown in Table 3. ABL kinase domain mutations were found at
baseline only in patients with imatinib resistance and not
in patients with imatinib intolerance (20 of 65 compared
with 0 of 22, P ¼ .002). Mutations were found more often in patients with an advanced phase CML (8 of 41 in

Interestingly, patients previously treated with another second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor had a borderline
lower frequency of ABL kinase domain mutations (1 of
15 compared with 19 of 60; P ¼ .057). The frequency of
ABL kinase domain mutations was not significantly different in patients with various baseline treatment histories,
including prior treatment with interferon a (7 of 27 in
treated compared with 10 of 48 in nontreated patients; P
¼ .57), chemotherapy (8 of 29 in treated compared with
9 of 45 in nontreated patients; P ¼ .57), and SCT (2 of 7
in treated compared with 21 of 77 in nontreated patients;
P ¼ 1.0). Similarly, there was no difference in the frequency of mutations between patients with additional
cytogenetic abnormalities at study entry (7 of 21) compared with those with no cytogenetic abnormalities (11 of
53; P ¼ .36). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of responses to nilotinib between patients
with and without ABL kinase domain mutations at baseline. CHR was newly achieved in 53% compared with
66%, partial cytogenetic response in 32% compared with
43%, complete cytogenetic response in 25% compared
with 40%, and major molecular response in 10% compared with 20% in patients with ABL kinase domain
mutations and patients with no mutations, respectively
(Table 2). Hughes et al15 has recently reported that the
clinical responses to nilotinib in patients with chronic

phase CML were similar in patients without baseline ABL
kinase domain mutations and those with mutations having a relatively low concentration that inhibits 50%
(IC50) value to nilotinib, with a cutoff value of 150 nM,
or with unknown IC50 values. We have therefore reanalyzed our data and compared the responses achieved in
patients harboring mutations with an IC50 >150 nM
(Y253H, E255K, T315I, and F359V) to the responses in
patients without mutations or with mutations and an
IC50 150 nM or an unknown IC50 (combined group).
In the group of patients harboring mutations with a high
IC50, CHR was newly achieved in 11%, and none of the
patients achieved a cytogenetic or molecular response
compared with newly achieved rates of CHR in 73%, partial cytogenetic response in 48%, CCR in 39%, and major
molecular response in 22% in the combined group (P ¼
.001, .008, .02, and .19, respectively) (Table 2).
Seven patients had both kinase domain mutations
and additional cytogenetic abnormalities at study entry.
In this subgroup, CHR was newly achieved in 57%,
partial cytogenetic response in 29%, complete cytogenetic response in 17%, and major molecular response in
0%. These rates were not significantly different from
the rates of responses in patients with neither kinase domain mutations nor other cytogenetic abnormalities
(CHR, 80%; partial cytogenetic response, 50%, 56%;
major molecular response, 19%; P ¼ .79). Among the
patients who were previously treated with a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 1 patient had 2 ABL
kinase domain mutations before starting therapy with
nilotinib (L387M and E255K). This patient’s best
response was a CHR.
New ABL kinase domain mutations were acquired
in 7 patients during nilotinib therapy (2 patients had 2
mutations each), including F311L, E255K (n ¼ 3),
T315I (n ¼ 3), Y253H, and F359V. All patients have discontinued nilotinib because of disease progression (n ¼ 6)
and SCT (1 patient).

Toxicity
The average daily nilotinib dose at the time of data collection in the 73 evaluable patients was 715 mg (range, 200800 mg). Hematological toxicities occurred in 36 (40%)
patients on nilotinib therapy and were of grade 3 to 4 in
31%. The most common toxicities were thrombocytopenia in 24 (27%) and leucopenia in 16 (18%) patients, and
were of grade 3 to 4 in 11 (13%) and 9 (10%) patients,
respectively. Nonhematological and biochemical adverse

events appearing in 2 patients are summarized in Table
4. Overall, 55% of patients experienced at least 1 nonhematological adverse event, with 1% being grade 3 to 4,
and 34% of patients had at least 1 biochemical abnormality during therapy, including a 7% rate of grade 3 to 4
abnormalities. The most common nonhematological
adverse events were skin rash, infections, headache, and
bone pain. Infections occurred in 7 (9%) patients and
were viral in 2 (herpes simplex and herpes zoster), bacterial in 2 (recurring pneumonia and cellulites), and fungal
in 1 (perianal mycosis). The nature of infection was not
defined in 2 patients. Of the 7 patients who entered the
study because of an intolerable skin rash and/or edema
during imatinib therapy, 4 had recurrence of skin rash
during nilotinib therapy, with 1 patient experiencing a
grade 3 to 4 skin rash. There was no recurrence of edema.
Of the patients previously treated with another second
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 4 have discontinued
treatment because of intolerance; all were treated with
dasatinib and suffered from dyspnea that was because of a
pleural effusion in 2 and an exacerbation of underlying
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 1 patient. The

nature of dyspnea in the fourth patient was not known,
and he had normal cardiac and lung functions and normal
chest computed tomography. None of the patients had a
recurrence of lung toxicity. The most common biochemical abnormalities were hyperbilirubinemia, an elevation of
liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, and an elevation of amylase
and/or lipase levels. Interestingly, 3 of the 5 patients with
abnormal pancreatic enzyme levels were reported from
the same center in Europe. There were no episodes of clinical pancreatitis. There were 5 patients who had liver toxicities during therapy with imatinib. None of these
patients had a recurrence of liver abnormalities during
nilotinib therapy. Rare adverse events during nilotinib
therapy, occurring in 1 patient each, included a low-grade
QT prolongation and grade 3 to 4 pneumonitis. One
patient suffered a grade 4 polyneuropathy but was found
to have a CNS relapse of lymphoid BC after the end of
the study.

DISCUSSION
The optimal selection and use of a second tyrosine kinase
inhibitor in CML patients who are imatinib intolerant or
resistant is of great importance and needs to be finely tuned.
Our results reinforce the efficacy and safety of nilotinib
shown in previous reports5-8 and recent updates.8,16-18
CHR was newly achieved in 66% and major cytogenetic
response in 43%. The rates of CHR (71%) and major
cytogenetic response (53%) in chronic phase are comparable to the reported rates of 74% and 48%, respectively.5
Similarly, the response rates in AP are equivalent to those
previously reported, with a CHR rate of 60% compared
with 47% and a major cytogenetic response rate of 29%
compared with 29%.6 The results of nilotinib therapy in
BC patients in our cohort are better than the recently
reported rates,8 with a CHR rate of 56% compared with
11% and a major cytogenetic response rate of 53% compared with 40%. The relatively small number of BC
patients analyzed in our study may explain these differences. The overall survival rate at 1 year for chronic phase
patients in our study is also in accordance with the previously published rate,5 and the rate in advanced phase of
64% is compatible with the published overall rate of 78%
in AP6 and 42% in BC.8 With currently 2 approved second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie, nilotinib
and dasatinib), and extensive research on other novel
kinase inhibitors, the identification of factors that may
predict the response to second line therapy can assist in
treatment decisions. For patients in chronic phase,

Nilotinib Therapy in CML Patients/Koren-Michowitz et al

Branford et al19 have recently demonstrated that the initial molecular response to a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor was predictive of subsequent responses. In
advanced phase patients, it was shown that the failure to
achieve a CHR at the time of achievement of a major
cytogenetic response with a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor is associated with a poor prognosis.20 In
the current study, we have found that a previous good
response to imatinib was predictive of a good response to
nilotinib. In addition, the depth of response to imatinib
was predictive of the depth of response to nilotinib. This
suggests that patients who are considered for second line
therapy with nilotinib because of imatinib intolerance or
those with secondary resistance after achieving at least a
CHR on imatinib are more likely to respond to nilotinib.
Conversely, patients who did not achieve at least a CHR
during therapy with imatinib are less likely to respond to
nilotinib and may do better with another tyrosine kinase
inhibitor or other treatment modalities.
Our findings regarding ABL kinase domain mutations are quite intriguing; kinase domain mutations in our
cohort were only found in imatinib resistant patients and
were less frequent in patients who were previously treated
with another second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
This may suggest that the mechanism of resistance in
patients treated sequentially with 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors is less likely to involve ABL kinase domain mutations.
Another possible explanation for the lower frequency of
kinase domain mutations observed may involve the study
inclusion criteria, allowing recruitment of patients with
intolerance to a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These patients are probably less likely to have ABL kinase domain mutations. In accordance with the recently
reported clinical results in chronic phase patients,21 and
with a cutoff of IC50 150 nM for mutations with a
higher chance of clinical responses to nilotinib recently
described by Hughes et al,15 we found that patients harboring mutations with an in vitro moderate or high resistance to nilotinib, including E255K, Y253H, and
F359V,22-25 were less likely to respond to nilotinib, and
none of the 3 T315I-positive patients responded. These
mutations were also the most commonly newly acquired
mutations in patients who did not respond to nilotinib or
progressed during therapy.
Therapy with nilotinib was well tolerated. We did
observe a recurrence of skin rash in patients who were intolerant to imatinib because of skin rashes; however, none of
the other imatinib-related toxicities recurred during nilotinib therapy. Importantly, none of the patients who experi-

enced pulmonary toxicities during dasatinib therapy had a
recurrent toxicity during therapy with nilotinib, making
this agent applicable for dasatinib-intolerant patients.
In conclusion, our results support the efficacy and
good tolerability of nilotinib treatment in patients who
are unable to continue imatinib therapy for CML in both
chronic phase and advanced phases. The relation between
responses to nilotinib and the previous response to imatinib therapy found in this study may assist in future decisions regarding the choice of a new generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitor as well as timing of therapeutic changes.
