Abstract
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are members of the
transforming growth factor-B superfamily, and they play an
important role for embryonic development, for bone and
cartilage formation, and during carcinogenesis. We have
previously shown that the novel Gemini vitamin D3 analogue,
Ro-438-3582 [Ro3582; 1A,25-dihydroxy-20S ,21(3-hydroxy3-methylbutyl)-23-yne-26,27-hexafluorocholecalciferol], inhibited cell proliferation and activated the BMP/Smad signaling
pathway in MCF10AT1 breast epithelial cells. In this report,
we investigated the upstream signaling pathways responsible
for the activation of BMP/Smad signaling by Ro3582. Among
seven different serine/threonine kinase inhibitors that we
tested, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors blocked the effects of
Ro3582 on the phosphorylation of Smad1/5, mRNA synthesis
for BMP-2 and BMP-6, and cell growth in MCF10AT1 cells.
Overexpression of PKCA, but not PKCE, PKCD or PKCZ
isoforms, increased Ro3582-induced phosphorylation of
Smad1/5, suggesting that PKCA mediates the activation of
Smad signaling and inhibition of cell proliferation. Interestingly, the activation of Smad signaling by Ro3582 was shown
in Ha-ras–transfected MCF10AT1 cells, but not in the parent
cell line (MCF10A without Ras). Inhibiting Ras activity
blocked the translocation of PKCA to the plasma membrane
and the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 induced by Ro3582,
indicating that Ras is necessary for the activation of PKCA
and Smad signaling. In conclusion, Ro3582 inhibits cell
proliferation and activates BMP/Smad signaling via a Ras
and PKCA pathway in breast epithelial cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The pivotal role of 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1a,25(OH)2D3],
the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, comprises the
maintenance of calcium/phosphate homeostasis and bone biology
(1). In addition to its well-established actions, many studies have
shown that 1a,25(OH)2D3 exerts antiproliferative, proapoptotic,
and prodifferentiating effects on many different cell types (1, 2).
Furthermore, 1a,25(OH)2D3 and certain vitamin D3 analogues have
been shown to inhibit invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis
associated with certain tumors (3, 4). We previously reported that
1a,25(OH)2D3 and a novel Gemini vitamin D3 analogue, Ro-4383582 [Ro3582; 1a,25-dihydroxy-20S,21(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-

23-yne-26,27-hexafluorocholecalciferol] (Fig. 1), inhibited the proliferation of breast epithelial cells and activated the bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway (5, 6).
BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h)
superfamily, which are now generally considered as multifunctional cytokines that affect inflammation, immune response, cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (7). As do TGF-hs,
BMPs regulate their biological cell responses through binding to
two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, which trigger
phosphorylation of the receptor-mediated Smad (R-Smad) at the
COOH-terminal of the MH2 domain (8). The activated R-Smads
recruit the common Smad, Smad4, and translocate to the nucleus
to mediate the transcription of BMP-dependent target genes,
primarily during embryonic development and bone formation (8).
Interestingly, there is an accumulation of data suggesting the
possible role of BMP as a tumor suppressor (9–14). For example,
activation of the BMP signaling pathway inhibited the growth of
epithelial cells by inducing the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)
inhibitor, p21 (9, 10), and in vivo tumor growth of androgeninsensitive prostate carcinoma cells was suppressed by BMP
signals (11). In addition, cancer-associated stromal cells expressed
the BMP antagonist, gremlin 1, which can promote tumor cell
growth (12). Mutation or loss of expression of molecules in the
BMP signaling pathway led to the enhancement of tumor
progression (13, 14), indicating that BMP signaling may be
important for inhibition of tumorigenesis. Therefore, modulating
BMP signaling during the formation of breast cancer by
pharmacologic agents, such as 1a,25(OH)2D3 and vitamin D3
analogues, may be important for the prevention and possible
treatment of breast cancer.
We recently reported that 1a,25(OH)2D3 and a vitamin D3
analogue Ro3582 activated the BMP signaling pathway, as shown
by enhanced phosphorylation of the MH2 domain (Ser463/465) of
Smad1/5 in breast epithelial cells (5, 6). We have now further
explored the upstream kinase signaling pathways responsible for
activation of BMP signaling by Ro3582 and for its role in growth
inhibition of breast epithelial cells. The effects of 1a,25(OH)2D3 and
its analogues are mainly mediated through the vitamin D receptor
(VDR) or through the membrane-associated signaling pathway
(1, 15). Membrane-associated responses to 1a,25(OH)2D3 [nongenomic, rapid response to 1a,25(OH)2D3], where the mechanism is
still unclear, is now considered an essential type of action involved
in calcium/phosphate transport, activation of protein kinase C
(PKC), and/or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascade (15–18).
Among many kinases, PKC has been shown to be regulated by
1a,25(OH)2D3 and certain several vitamin D3 analogues (17, 19, 20).
The PKC family is a group of serine/threonine kinases known to
regulate cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, cell migration, and
carcinogenesis in different types of cells and models (21, 22). Boyan
et al. (19, 20) suggest that a caveolar environment may play an

Activation of BMP Signaling via Ras and PKCa

important role in mediating the PKC activation by 1a,25(OH)2D3.
Studies investigating the effects of 1a,25(OH)2D3 and vitamin D3
analogues on the PKC family have shown that regulation of the
MAPK pathway by 1a,25(OH)2D3 and vitamin D3 analogues was
mediated by the activation of RAF-1/Ras/PKC in muscle cells and
myeloid leukemic cells (17, 18).
Interestingly, several studies have reported that PKC interacts
with the TGF-h/BMP signaling pathway (23–25). PKC-dependent
phosphorylation of the MH1 domain of TGF-h–specific Smads
(Smad2/3) led to down-regulation of the growth-inhibitory and
apoptotic action of TGF-h (23). In contrast, BMP-2 enhances
apoptosis by using the PKC-dependent signaling pathway in
human osteoblasts (24). It was also reported that Smad6 regulates
TGF-h and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 through a PKC-h–
dependent mechanism (25), and Smad3 and PKCy mediate TGFh1–induced collagen I expression in human mesangial cells (26).
These studies suggest a new mechanism for the regulation of PKC
by 1a,25(OH)2D3 and vitamin D3 analogues that may affect the
TGF-h/BMP signaling pathway.
In the present study, we investigated whether PKC is involved in
the activation of BMP/Smad signaling by a potent Gemini vitamin
D3 analogue Ro3582, and whether this is important for the
inhibition of cell proliferation of breast epithelial cells. We report
here that Ro3582 activates Smad signaling and inhibits the
proliferation of MCF10AT1 cells through a Ras/PKCa pathway.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. 1a,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1a,25(OH)2D3] and a Gemini
vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582 (>95% purity; Fig. 1) were provided by
Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. PKC inhibitors (Go6976, Go6983, and PKCh C2-4
inhibitor), MAP/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)
inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126), p38 inhibitor (SB203580), c-Jun-NH2-kinase
(JNK) inhibitor (SP600125), PKA inhibitor (H-89), and the AKT inhibitor
[a phosphatidylinositol ether analogue, 1L6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecyl-sn-glycerocarbonate] were obtained from
Calbiochem. Other chemicals, including TGF-h receptor I kinase inhibitor
(SB431542) and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002HCl),
were from Sigma. Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor (L-744832) was from
Biomol. Vitamin D3 analogues and inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO
before addition to cell cultures, and final concentrations of DMSO were
0.1% or less. Controls with DMSO alone were run in all cases.
Cell culture. Human MCF10 breast epithelial cell lines (MCF10A and
MCF10AT1) were provided by Dr. Fred Miller’s group (Barbara Ann

Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI). The MCF10AT1 breast epithelial
cell line was developed by transfecting Ha-ras oncogene into MCF10A
normal immortalized breast epithelial cells, and the cell line was then
passaged in mice to select more aggressive and malignant cells (27, 28).
MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium
supplemented with 5% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 Ag/mL
insulin, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.5 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, and 100 ng/mL cholera toxin at 37jC, 5% CO2.
Western blot analysis. MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells were plated and
starved for 24 h in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium. Cells were then
incubated with compounds in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/DMEM/
F12 medium for the indicated times, as described in the figure legends. The
proteins were extracted by cell lysis with radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1%
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 0.1% leupeptin). The same
amount of protein was run in 4% to 15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and
transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PALL). The primary
antibodies against phospho-Smad1/5, phospho-Smad3, PKCa (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), hemagglutinin (Covance), actin (Sigma), and
secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) were used.
Quantitative PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells
using the Trizol method from Invitrogen. One microgram of total RNA was
reverse transcribed to cDNA using the random primers and Applied
Biosystem High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit in a 96-well format Mastercycler
Gradient from Eppendorf North America. Quantitative PCR was performed
using Applied Biosystems Taqman Gene Expression Assay reagents on an ABI
Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System. The thermal conditions were as
follows: one cycle of 50jC for 2 min, one cycle of 95jC for 10 min, 40 cycles of
95jC for 15 s, and 60jC for 1 min. Labeled primers, including glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), BMP2, BMP6, and CYP24A1, were
obtained from Applied Biosystems. GAPDH was used as an internal control.
The relative changes in gene expression were calculated by the following
formula: fold change = 2( DDC t) = 2 [DC t (treated samples) DC t (vehicle control)],
where, DC t = C t (detected gene) C t (GAPDH) and C t is the threshold cycle
number.
Transient transfection of PKC isoforms. The vectors containing PKCa,
PKCy, PKCq, or PKC~ isoforms linked to hemagglutinin were kindly
provided by Drs. Bernard Weinstein (Department of Medicine, Columbia
University, New York, NY) and Jae-Won Soh (Department of Chemistry,
Inha University, Incheon, Korea; ref. 29), and we subcloned the fusion
protein of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–PKCa using pEGFP-C1 vector
(BD Bioscience Clontech). For the transient transfection of PKCa, we
incubated DNA with jetPEI transfecting agent (Poly-plus Transfection) in
150 mmol/L NaCl for 20 min, and this was directly added to the cells in
MCF10AT1 culture medium. After 24 h, the cells were starved in serum-free

induced by the vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582. A, MCF10AT1 cells (1  106 per 100-mm dish) were starved in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium for 24 h, and then
incubated with Ro3582 (10 nmol/L) and/or the following different types of kinase inhibitors: PKCa/PKChI inhibitor (Go6976, 0.5 Amol/L), PI3K inhibitor (LY294002HCl,
10 Amol/L), MEK inhibitors (PD98059, 10 Amol/L and U0126, 20 Amol/L), p38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580, 10 Amol/L), a JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 20 Amol/L), a PKA
inhibitor (H-89, 10 Amol/L), an Akt inhibitor (a phosphatidylinositol ether analogue, 10 Amol/L), and a TGF-h type I receptor inhibitor (SB431542, 10 Amol/L) in
0.1% BSA/DMEM/F12 medium for 24 h. The level of phospho-Smad1/5 and h-actin was shown by Western blotting. Induction of the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 by the
vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582 was abolished by the PKCa/PKChI inhibitor Go6976. B, MCF10AT1 cells (1  106 per 100-mm dish) were starved in serum-free DMEM/
F12 medium and then treated with the vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582 (10 nmol/L) and/or the PKCa/PKChI inhibitor Go6976 (0.5 Amol/L) in 0.1% BSA/DMEM/F-12
medium for 12 or 24 h. Total RNA was isolated, and the measurement of BMP-2, BMP-6, or CYP24A1 mRNA was performed as described in Materials and Methods.
GAPDH values were used to normalize the production of the mRNA. Two separate experiments were performed and combined (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, statistical
significance). C, MCF10AT1 cells (5,000 per well in a 24-well plate) were treated with Ro3582 (1 nmol/L) and/or PKCa/PKChI inhibitor Go6976 (0.1 Amol/L) for
3 d in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. [3H]thymidine (1 ACi) was added 3 h before the harvest and radioactivity
in total DNA was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Three separate experiments were performed and combined (***, P < 0.001, statistical significance).

DMEM/F12 overnight and then treated with experimental test compounds
in 0.1% BSA/DMEM/F12.
Fluorescence microscopy. The immunofluorescence procedure was
described previously (6). Briefly, MCF10AT1 cells were incubated with
compounds in a poly-L-lysine–coated chamber slide (Nunc) or in a glassbottomed dish (MatTek) for the indicated times. Then, cells were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde [1 PBS (pH 7.4)] for 20 min, and blocked for 1 h
with 10% BSA/0.5% Triton-X/1 PBS solution. The primary antibody
(1:100 dilution for PKCa) and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody
(Molecular Probes) were probed in 10% BSA/PBS solution. The cells were
irradiated with a green laser (488 nm), and UV light (364 nm) was used for
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. GFP-PKCa fusion protein
was directly detected by green fluorescence irradiation at 488 nm after
transient transfection.
[3H]thymidine uptake assay. MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells were
incubated with compounds for 3 days. [3H]thymidine (1 ACi) was added
to each well 3 h before the harvest. The cells were precipitated with
10% trichloroacetic acid, washed, and solubilized (30), and the incorpora-

Student’s t test.

Results
The activation of Smad signaling by Ro3582 is blocked by
PKCA/PKCBI inhibitor Go6976 in MCF10AT1 breast epithelial
cells. In previous studies, we showed that 1a,25(OH)2D3 and Ro3582
inhibited the proliferation and activated Smad signaling, and
Ro3582 exerted a much stronger effect than 1a,25(OH)2D3
(5, 6), as determined by the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 in
MCF10AT1 breast epithelial cells. Here, we tested seven different
serine/threonine kinase and PI3K inhibitors to investigate the
upstream cell signaling pathways that may be responsible for the
activation of Smad1/5 signaling. Among the inhibitors tested,

Activation of BMP Signaling via Ras and PKCa

the PKC inhibitor (Go6976, an inhibitor of the classic Ca2+dependent PKCa and PKChI isoforms) blocked the phosphorylation
of Smad1/5 induced by Ro3582, whereas the PI3K inhibitor
(LY294002HCl), the MEK inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126), the
p38 inhibitor (SB203580), the JNK inhibitor (SP600125), the PKA
inhibitor (H-89), the AKT inhibitor (a phosphatidylinositol ether
analogue), and the TGF-h type I receptor inhibitor (SB431542)
showed little or no effect on the level of phospho-Smad1/5 induced
by Ro3582 (Fig. 2A).
PKCA/PKCBI inhibitor Go6976 inhibits BMP2/6 and
CYP24A1 mRNA synthesis induced by Ro3582. Next, we tested
whether the PKCa/PKChI inhibitor Go6976 regulates the target
genes of BMP and VDR signaling induced by Ro3582. MCF10AT1
cells were incubated with Ro3582 with or without Go6976, and
mRNA productions of BMP-2, BMP-6, and CYP24A1 were measured
by quantitative PCR. BMP-2 and BMP-6 are ligands of the BMP
signaling pathway. CYP24A1 (vitamin D 24-hydroxylase) is a
prominent vitamin D response gene and it is known to inactivate 1a,25(OH)2D3 by hydroxylation in the 24-position. As shown
in Fig. 2B, mRNA levels for BMP-2, BMP-6, and CYP24A1 were
increased by Ro3582 at 12 h and more markedly at 24 h confirming
our earlier studies (5, 6), and these inductions were significantly
inhibited by Go6976.
Growth inhibition by Ro3582 is reversed by PKCA/PKCBI
inhibitor Go6976 in MCF10AT1 breast epithelial cells. We

previously reported that Ro3582 activates Smad signaling and
inhibits cell growth in MCF10AT1 cells (5, 6). Here, we used the
PKCa/PKChI inhibitor Go6976 to determine whether blocking
Smad signaling by Go6976 would affect growth inhibition by
Ro3582 in MCF10AT1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, Ro3582 exerted
f60% growth inhibition at 1 nmol/L, whereas Go6976 itself has
little effect on growth inhibition at 0.1 Amol/L. When cells were
treated with Ro3582 together with Go6976, the PKCa/PKChI
inhibitor Go6976 significantly reversed the growth inhibition
induced by Ro3582 (P < 0.001).
PKCA is a crucial mediator for the phosphorylation of
Smad1/5 by Ro3582. Because the PKC family has multiple
isoforms, we next determined which PKC isoforms may be involved
in the activation of Smad signaling by Ro3582. We first tested the
different types of PKC inhibitors, such as Go6976 (PKCa/PKChI
inhibitor), Go6983 (PKCa, PKCh, PKCg, PKCy, PKC~ inhibitor)
and PKCh C2-4 inhibitor (PKCa/PKCh inhibitor), at several concentrations. The phosphorylation of Smad1/5 induced by Ro3582
was inhibited by all of these PKC inhibitors, suggesting that PKCa
and/or PKCh might be involved in Smad activation by Ro3582
(Fig. 3A). In addition, we tested four different PKC isoforms: PKCa
(a classic PKC isoform), PKCq and PKCy (novel PKC isoforms), and
PKC~ (an atypical PKC isoform). These vectors were linked to a
hemagglutinin tag and the transfection of vectors was confirmed
by expression of hemagglutinin (Fig. 3B). Transfection with the

then incubated with Ro3582 (10 nmol/L) and/or three different PKC inhibitors, PKCa/PKChI inhibitor (Go6976, 0.5 and 5 Amol/L), PKCa/PKCh/PKCg/PKCy/PKC~
inhibitor (Go6983, 1, 5, and 10 Amol/L), and PKCh C2-4 inhibitor (PKCa/PKCh inhibitor, 1, 5, and 10 Amol/L) for 24 h. B, MCF10AT1 cells (2  105 per well in a six-well
plate) were transfected with the vectors containing PKC isoforms (PKCa, PKCy, PKCq, or PKC~) linked to hemagglutinin (HA ) under the conditions described in
Materials and Methods. After starvation in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium, cells were treated with Ro3582 (10 nmol/L) for 24 h. The level of phospho-Smad1/5,
hemagglutinin, PKCa, and h-actin was shown by Western blotting. C, MCF10AT1 cells (20,000 per chamber in a four-well chamber slide) were starved in serum-free
DMEM/F12 medium, and then incubated with Ro3582 (10 nmol/L) for 1 h or 24 h in 0.1% BSA/DMEM/F12 medium. TPA (10 nmol/L) treatment for 1 h was used as a
positive control for PKCa activation. Green, staining for PKCa; blue, DAPI staining for the nucleus. Magnification, 63. D, MCF10AT1 cells (2  105 per glass-bottomed
dish) were transfected transiently with the vector expressing GFP-PKCa fusion protein for 24 h. After starvation, TPA (10 nmol/L) and Ro3582 (10 nmol/L) were
treated for 1 and 24 h, respectively. Green, GFP detected at 488 nm; blue, DAPI staining for the nucleus. Magnification, 63.

control vector (pcDNA) showed a lower level of pSmad1/5
induction by Ro3582 compared with that without transfection
(data not shown). Overexpression of PKCa enhanced the
phosphorylation of Smad1/5 induced by Ro3582. However, overexpression of PKCq, PKCy, or PKC~ showed little or no effect on the
Ro3582-mediated increase in the level of pSmad1/5 (Fig. 3B).
Ro3582 activates PKCA in MCF10AT1 breast epithelial cells.
PKCa is translocalized to the plasma membrane after calcium and
diacylglycerol binding to C2 and C1 domain, respectively, which
can lead to enzymatic activation (22). Using confocal microscopy,
the cellular distribution of PKCa was determined after treatment
with Ro3582 or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a
well-known PKC activator, in MCF10AT1 cells. DAPI staining
was used to recognize the nuclear morphology in cells. We first
used PKCa antibody to detect the location of endogenous PKCa
in MCF10AT1 cells. When the cells were treated with TPA
(10 nmol/L), PKCa translocated to the membrane within 1 h.
However, Ro3582 (10 nmol/L) did not change the cellular location
of PKCa at 1 h. Interestingly, after 24 h of Ro3582 treatment,
PKCa was markedly translocated to the membrane (Fig. 3C). We
next transfected GFP-PKCa vector (PKCa linked to a fluorescent

marker, GFP) and PKCa was detected directly using green
fluorescence (GFP) at 488 nm. We confirmed that both Ro3582
and TPA triggered the translocation of PKCa to the membrane
(Fig. 3D).
Ras is necessary for the induction of pSmad1/5 by Ro3582.
Because studies of the interregulation between Ras and TGF-h/
BMP signaling were reported earlier (31–35), we investigated
whether the transfected Ras in MCF10AT1 cells may affect the
regulation of Smad signaling induced by Ro3582. MCF10AT1 cells
were established by transfecting Ha-ras into MCF10A normal
breast epithelial cells and passaging in animals (27, 28). As shown
in Fig. 4A, both MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cell lines showed the
same level of response to TGF-h or BMP-2 treatment, determined
by the phosphorylation of Smad3 by TGF-h and the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 by BMP-2. However, Ro3582 increased pSmad1/5
in Ha-ras–transfected MCF10AT1 cells, but not in the parent
MCF10A cells. Furthermore, Ro3582 inhibited cell proliferation in
MCF10AT1 cells, but not in the parent MCF10A cells (Fig. 4B),
suggesting the critical role of Ras in Smad activation and growth
inhibition by Ro3582. In addition, inhibiting Ras activity by a Ras
farnesyltransferase inhibitor (Ras inhibitor, L-744832) blocked the

phosphorylation of Smad1/5 induced by Ro3582 in a dosedependent manner in MCF10AT1 cells (Fig. 4C), although the
Ras inhibitor did not reverse growth inhibition induced by Ro3582
(Fig. 4D), which may be due to the growth-inhibitory effect of the
Ras inhibitor by itself (data not shown).
PKCA activation by Ro3582 is blocked by a Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor in MCF10AT1 cells. The integration
between Ras/MAPK and PKC has been reported (36–38) and we
found that both PKCa and Ha-ras regulated the phosphorylation of
Smad1/5 that was induced by Ro3582. Therefore, we examined
whether Ras signaling is necessary to regulate PKCa, which in turn
enhances Smad signaling by Ro3582. Here, the treatment with the
Ras inhibitor did not affect PKCa distribution in MCF10AT1 cells.
However, Ro3582 induced the cellular translocation of PKCa to the
membrane, and when treated together with the Ras inhibitor, the
translocation of PKCa to the membrane induced by Ro3582 was
markedly inhibited (Fig. 5).

Discussion
BMPs, members of the TGF-h superfamily, have been identified
as multifunctional regulators of development, bone formation, and
tissue remodeling. Recently, the role of BMPs in proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis has drawn much
attention (9–14, 39, 40). Although BMPs are known to regulate
growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in many different cell types
and models, the role of BMPs as tumor suppressors in breast
cancer is still unsettled (41, 42).
We recently reported that a novel Gemini vitamin D3 analogue, Ro3582, strongly inhibited the growth of human MCF10AT1
breast epithelial cells (5, 6). Mechanistic studies indicated that
this compound activated BMP/Smad signaling, as determined by
increased phosphorylation of Smad1/5, translocation of pSmad1/5
to the nucleus, and enhancement of the BMP/Smad transcriptional
activity (6). In the present report, we identified key upstream
signaling pathways responsible for BMP/Smad signaling that are
activated by Ro3582. We found that the vitamin D3 analogue
Ro3582 activated PKCa, which led to the phosphorylation of
Smad1/5 and inhibition of the growth of MCF10AT1 cells.
Furthermore, Ras was involved in the activation of PKCa and
Smad signaling by Ro3582, suggesting that both Ras and PKCa may

act as crucial mediators of Ro3582 effects on MCF10AT1 breast
epithelial cells.
Many studies of cross-talk between Ras and TGF-h/Smad
signaling have been described during the last decade (31–35). Yue
et al. (31) reported that TGF-h activated the Ras/MAPK pathway
required for the autocrine TGF-h production and Smad1 regulation.
Ras was also suggested as a mediator of pleiotropic TGF-h1
signaling in developing neurons (32). The activation of Ras/MAPK
or the presence of oncogenic Ras was shown to enhance TGF-h–
induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (33, 34). More importantly, it has been shown that 1a,25(OH)2D3 regulates the MAPK
pathway by activating Ras/RAF-1 signaling in muscle cells and in
myeloid leukemic cells (17, 18). We showed in this report that the
vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582 increased phosphorylation of Smad1/5
and inhibited cell proliferation in MCF10AT1 cells transfected with
Ha-ras, but not in the parent MCF10A cells that lack Ras (Fig. 4),
suggesting that Ras is critical for the activation of Smad signaling
and growth inhibition by Ro3582.
The kinase pathways, such as Ras/ERK/MAPK, MEKK, JNK, p38
MAPK, CDK, and PKC, have been shown to regulate Smad signaling
(43–46). MEKK1 or JNK enhanced Smad phosphorylation, nuclear
localization, and Smad-mediated transcription (44, 45). In contrast,
the phosphorylation of R-Smads at the linker domain or MH-1
domain induced by Ras/Erk/MAPK, CDK2/4, and PKC inhibited
the activation of Smad signaling (23, 43, 46, 47). Yakymovych et al.
(23) reported that PKC activation resulted in the phosphorylation
of the MH1 domains of Smad2 and Smad3 to abrogate DNA
binding of Smad3. Although this study suggests that PKC may play
a negative regulatory role in TGF-h/Smad–mediated transcription
(23), our previous studies indicated that Ro3582 induced the
phosphorylation of Smad1/5 in the MH2 domain (Ser463/465) and
enhanced the BMP-specific signaling pathway (5, 6). In addition,
our present study showed that this was blocked by PKC inhibitors
(Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting a role of PKC for the activation of BMP/
Smad signaling by Ro3582.
PKCs were originally thought to be promitogenic kinases, but
this effect may be PKC isoform dependent and cell-type dependent,
as many PKCs can also inhibit cell cycle progression (22). Members
of the PKC family are mainly classified into three groups: classic
(calcium and diacylglycerol dependent kinase; a, hI, hII, and g),
novel (calcium insensitive and diacylglycerol dependent kinase; y,

Figure 6. A schematic diagram depicting the
proposed mechanism of Ro3582 on the RasPKCa-Smad pathway in MCF10AT1 breast epithelial
cells. The activation of BMP-specific Smad signaling by
a vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582 may be mediated
through Ras/PKCa, which results in increased
phosphorylation of Smad1/5 followed by growth
inhibition of MCF10AT1 breast epithelial cells.
Activation of Ras signaling may lead to either
stimulation or inhibition of cell growth, depending on
the downstream signaling pathway involved. RTK,

q, A, and u), and atypical (calcium and diacylglycerol insensitive
kinase; D and E/L) PKC isoforms (21). Among many different PKC
isoforms, PKCa is known to inhibit cell proliferation via p21
induction and suppress tumor formation in vivo (48, 49). Several
studies have previously shown that 1a,25(OH)2D3 activates PKCa,
and activation of this isoform acts as an antiproliferative signal
(17, 20, 48, 49). Our results also indicate that PKCa mediates the
activation of Smad signaling, which is important for growth
inhibition by the vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582. As shown in
Fig. 6, we have depicted a schematic diagram for our proposed
mechanism of the vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582 in MCF10AT1
breast epithelial cells. Many growth factors, such as EGF or
vascular endothelial growth factor, can stimulate growth in
epithelial cells via Ras-MEK-ERK signaling. Based on our data, we
postulate that the vitamin D3 analogue Ro3582 may require Ras to
activate PKCa and to initiate Smad signaling, and PKCa signaling
may be a key downstream target pathway to mediate growth
inhibition by Ro3582 (Fig. 6).
It was suggested that PKCa activation by 1a,25(OH)2D3 was
through the 1a,25(OH)2D3 membrane-associated rapid response
steroid binding protein (16, 20). The classic VDR, which is known
to translocate to the nucleus after ligand binding, has been
proposed to be associated with caveolae in the plasma membrane
and is responsible for the rapid response to vitamin D ligands
(15, 50). The structural flexibility of 1a,25(OH)2D3 and vitamin D3
analogues may determine their preferences for binding to different
locations on the VDR and for selective responses between genomic

and membrane-mediated effects (15, 50). In this study, we showed
that Ro3582 activated PKCa, which led to the enhancement of
Smad signaling in MCF10AT1 cells. However, we do not understand
yet, and it needs to be determined, whether either membraneassociated rapid response steroid binding protein or VDR
associated with caveolae mediates the activation of BMP/Smad
signaling by Ro3582 in MCF10AT1 breast epithelial cells.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study shows for the
first time that a Gemini vitamin D3 analogue activates the BMP/
Smad signaling through a Ras/PKCa pathway, which leads to the
inhibition of cell proliferation in MCF10 human breast epithelial
cells. Further investigations are needed to understand the
interactions between the Ras/PKCa pathway and the regulation
of BMP/Smad signaling by vitamin D3 analogues and their
interactions with the nuclear or membrane-bound VDR.
