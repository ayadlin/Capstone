Combination Targeted Therapy in
Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma*
Jeffrey Sosman, MD and Igor Puzanov, MD

Several novel therapies have been approved recently in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These agents
inhibit pathways downstream of loss of the von Hippel-Lindau gene VHL. They target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligand, VEGF receptor (VEGFR), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and
other potentially important pathways. Even with improvements in survival, disease progresses in all
patients. There is a critical need to increase complete responses (now rare). One such strategy is combining
several agents to block different levels of the VEGF-VEGFR axis (vertical blockade). Alternatively, combination of a VEGF-VEGFR inhibitor with an mTOR inhibitor is attractive. Finally, horizontal blockade of VEGFR
with epidermal growth factor receptor and/or platelet-derived growth factor receptor, all signaling pathways activated by hypoxia-inducible factor, is another approach. Already trials have revealed difficulties
with combination therapy. By combining agents, the toxicity of 1 or both can be enhanced. The authors of
this article report their experience with sorafenib plus bevacizumab, which produced increases in hand-foot
syndrome, hypertension, and proteinuria, all known toxic effects. Clinical activity was impressive with 25
responses in 48 patients (52% response rate). Other combinations also required dose reductions (sorafenib
with temsirolimus) or were intolerable (sunitinib with temsirolimus or sunitinib with bevacizumab). Unexpected toxicity characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurred late in treatment with sunitinib and bevacizumab. Toxicity may be more severe in patients with RCC, who frequently have 1 kidney and
poor renal function. Once tolerability for combination regimens has been established, it will be critical to
design informative phase 2 trials and address the benefit of combination versus sequential therapy. Cancer

Previously, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) had been considered a malignancy that was refractory to most therapies with the occasional exception of immunotherapy.1-3 However, during the past
decade with the development of effective antiangiogenic agents, treatment has made significant gains for
patients with CCRCC. Understanding the essential role of the von Hippel-Lindau gene VHL and its regulation of cellular levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a) and HIF-2a in CCRCC has provided
a rationale to evaluate drugs that inhibited the downstream mediators of HIF.4-6 These genes include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor

(EGF), and EGF receptor (EGFR) as well as a number of
other genes, including the erythropoietin gene EPO, the
carbonic anhydrase IX gene CAIX, the glucose transporter
1 gene Glut-1, and the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor
4 gene CXCR4, to name only a few. Currently, 5 drugs, all
of which interfere with HIF and/or downstream gene
products, have demonstrated effectiveness in phase 3 trials. The antiangiogenic agents include multitargeted kinase inhibitors, sunitinib (inhibiting VEGF receptor
[VEGFR], PDGF receptor [PDGFR], c-kit, fms-related
tyrosine kinase 3 [Flt3]), sorafenib (inhibiting VEGFR,
PDGFR, c-kit, Flt3, c-RAF), bevacizumab (an antibody
to VEGF ligand), and temsirolimus or everolimus (both
mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors).7-11
Several general observations are readily apparent:
1. Sorafenib extended progression-free survival (PFS) by
100% from 2.8 months to 5.6 months in patients who
failed on cytokine therapy compared with placebo,8
but there is no evidence that, in untreated patients,
PFS can be extended compared with interferon.12
2. Sorafenib has a low objective response rate
(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
[RECIST], 30%), generally <10%, but many
patients have stable disease with some tumor
shrinkage or necrosis (but less than the 30%
shrinkage required by RECIST criteria).8,13
3. Sunitinib can increase PFS in untreated patients
compared with interferon from 4 months to 11
months.7
4. Sunitinib has an objective response rate of 35% to
40% but produces few if any complete responses
(CRs).7,14,15
5. Bevacizumab plus interferon extends PFS versus
interferon from 4 months to >10 months with a
31% response rate.10
6. Temsirolimus alone can extend overall survival by
50% in patients with poor prognostic RCC (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] scale),
even with an objective response rate <10%.9,16
7. Everolimus can increase PFS significantly compared
with placebo in patients who are refractory to tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (sorafenib and/or sunitinib).11
8. Few CRs are induced by any of the treatments,
and all patients will develop progression usually
within 8 to 16 months

9. Overall survival improvements are very likely but
difficult to establish because of the large crossover
populations.17,18
10. Some patients have very extensive responses to therapy. In these patients, if it is feasible, the resection
of residual metastatic disease may be a reasonable
option. This approach may lead to long-term freedom from disease. In addition, in patients who
have large primary tumors that remain in place,
undergoing a debulking nephrectomy after systemic
therapy is an option. This surgery may become easier technically after therapy. This option is being
evaluated at an increasing number of centers.
On the basis of the current knowledge, by combining these agents, we hope to improve the benefit to
patients with renal cancer. Options for combination therapy include the inhibition of several steps in the sequence
along the same pathway (HIF-VEGFR-VEGFR), which
has been called vertical blockade. Combination therapy
also can target 2 separate pathways with different functions (PDGFR, VEGFR, EGFR) in parallel, which has
been called horizontal blockade. Another rational approach
is to combine 2 agents, 1 of which can modulate the
expression of a target of the second agent, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the second agent. Finally, to make these
drugs more effective in combination, each drug individually must target a nonredundant pathway that is critical to
cell survival.
What is the benefit we are hoping to achieve? Certainly, current therapy has limitations, and resistance ultimately will occur in all patients after a few months or a
few years. An improved outcome may be 1 that increases
the number of CRs critical for therapy to be curative.
Conversely, therapy could be improved simply by making
treatment effective in more patients for longer periods.
Long remissions with a median of 2 to 3 years would be a
desired outcome. Combinations may require a decrease in
the dose of individual drugs to diminish the financial cost.
There obviously are some potential problems. First,
sequential therapy may allow for several remissions that,
together, last as long or longer than the remissions
achieved with combination therapy. There is a growing
body of literature on second- and third-line therapy that
can be effective after recurrence (Table 1).11,19-21 Second,
combinations of drugs may increase the toxicity even

without overlapping single-agent toxicity. This may occur
because of changes in metabolism or drug distribution,
although this has not been established. However, the
spectrum of the single-agent toxic effects to skin, blood
pressure, proteinuria, bone marrow suppression, and
mucositis involving the entire gastrointestinal tract
must be taken into consideration when combining drugs
(Table 2).

ATTEMPTS AT HORIZONTAL
BLOCKADE
Initial efforts at horizontal blockade were pursued by
Hainsworth and his colleagues (Fig. 1).22,24 Attempts
were made to block the VEGF pathway with bevacizumab
and to block the EGFR pathway with erlotinib, which is
an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Initial phase 2 findings in a 2-center trial were promising with what appeared
to be a better response than what was reported with
bevacizumab alone.22 Of 58 evaluable patients, 12 patients
(21%) had objective partial remissions, 38 patients (66%)
had stable disease, and 12 additional patients had significant regression but did not meet RECIST criteria. Only 8
patients (13%) initially developed disease progression after
2 4-week cycles. Attempts to add a PDGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (imatinib) to the combination was not tolerable.24 Bukowski and colleagues attempted to confirm those
results in a randomized placebo-blinded study in which
2370

all patients received bevacizumab and were randomized to
receiver either placebo or erlotinib.25 The response rate was
between 10% and 15%. The addition of erlotinib added
toxicity but did not obviously improve the response rate or
PFS. Theoretically, horizontal blockade still is an attractive
approach, when combined with the inhibition of other
pathways (PDGFR and VEGFR) by sunitinib and sorafenib. In vitro at the cellular level, RCC is highly responsive
to EGFR inhibition.26 CCRCC has high expression of
EGFR, but this has not translated into a therapeutic benefit. Could K-ras mutations in CCRCC explain resistance to
EGFR inhibition, as it does in part for lung cancer and colon cancer? This may be a topic for further studies.
Attempts at Vertical Blockade
We and others have pursued different combination regimens, including drugs that block HIF translation (the
mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus), inhibit
VEGF (bevacizumab), or inhibit VEGFR (sunitinib or
sorafenib) (Fig. 1). Other regimens inhibit the VEGF
ligand (bevacizumab) plus the VEGFR kinase (sunitinib
or sorafenib). Elevation in VEGF and HIF levels are likely
to occur in response to the hypoxic environment. Escape
from sunitinib and sorafenib blockade of the VEGFR and
mTOR inhibition of HIF translation may occur if levels
of VEGF exceed a threshold that can overcome the blockade. Levels of VEGF are known to increase in blood after

therapy with both sunitinib and sorafenib, but their role
in resistance is not established. Inhibition of these pathways at another level, such as VEGF ligand or HIF with
mTOR inhibitors, in some cases could either prevent or
circumvent the developing resistance. The phase 1 trials
are extremely small, and some have been restricted to
patients with RCC alone or others have been open to all
patients with solid tumors (Table 3).27-33 Toxicity has
been variable. Although in, some combinations, both
agents seem to be tolerable when used in full doses (temsirolimus or everolimus with bevacizumab),28,29 other not

gether (temsirolimus with sunitinib, bevacizumab with
sunitinib).32 There appeared to be a difference in toxicity
when the combinations were administered to patients
with RCC alone or to a diversity of cancer patients in
some phase 1 studies. This was most apparent with the
sunitinib and bevacizumab combination,30,31 The phenomena that causes the enhanced toxic effects in patients
with RCC may be related to their limited renal reserve or
even may be an aspect of RCC biology. The increased toxicity observed with some regimens has been studied only
in a limited fashion, with a few studies demonstrating no
drug-drug interactions or changes in pharmacokinetics.

temsirolimus has been difficult to administer safely to

patients with RCC.30,32 Limited experience in the first
few patients revealed dose-limiting toxic effects even at
low doses of sunitinib and temsirolimus.32 Conversely,
combining sunitinib with bevacizumab in patients with
RCC appeared to be safe at full doses until long-term follow-up revealed that numerous patients had developed
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with hemolysis,
schistocytes in blood, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low
platelet counts, renal insufficiency, and neurologic toxic
effects with seizures and confusion.30 This toxicity has not
been observed in a phase 1 trial that enrolled predominantly non-RCC patients at the Cleveland Clinic.31
Our own experience in patients with RCC who
received sorafenib plus bevacizumab has been remarkable
in terms of the enhanced toxic effects observed from combining the drugs.27 This has been characterized by the sorafenib-related toxic effects of severe hand-foot syndrome
and severe functional stomatitis and the bevacizumabrelated toxic effects of hypertension, which was difficult to
control even with multiple antihypertensive medications,
and persistent proteinuria (protein level >2 g). The combination required lowering the bevacizumab dose in
nearly all patients to 5 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks
and lowering the sorafenib dose to 200 mg orally once
daily. Patients who started treatment at higher doses had
2372

to interrupt their therapy rapidly and then reduce their
dose within the initial 2 to 4 weeks.
In terms of the clinical activity of these combinations,
the data are limited up to this point. We have observed a
52% response rate among all 48 patients who were enrolled on the sorafenib plus bevacizumab phase 1 trial.27
The overall PFS was 14 months, and 11 patients still continue to receive therapy without disease progression at 13
to 33 months. In 2008, Whorf et al presented a phase 2
trial of everolimus and bevacizumab in 59 patients with
RCC.28 Twenty-nine of those patients had received previous therapy with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both, and 30
patients were untreated for metastatic disease. Untreated
patients had a response rate of 23% (7 of 30 patients),
whereas patients who had received prior multitargeted kinase inhibitor therapy had a response rate of 17% (5 of 29
patients), and approximately 60% of patients initially were
stable in both groups. The PFS was 12 months and 11
months for untreated and previously treated patients,
respectively. Feldman and colleagues at MSKCC observed
an excellent response rate of >50% in patients who
received sunitinib and bevacizumab, although long-term
toxic effects made this combination untenable because of
disabling adverse effects (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia).30 Finally, Merchan and colleagues at the Mayo

and bevacizumab that was able to quickly dose escalate to
full doses of each agent.29 Also impressive were the 8
responses among only 11 evaluable patients.
Other New Agents in RCC
Currently, there is a plethora of other targeted agents that
have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration but that quickly are undergoing clinical
evaluation initially as single agents. VEGF or VEGFR
remain good targets for axitinib, pazopanib, and
AZD2171, all of which inhibit VEGFR; whereas VEGF
ligand inhibition includes the VEGF Trap and IM1121B.34-36 There also are Tie-2 inhibitors (AMG 386)
and inhibitors to the PI3/Akt kinase pathway (Perifosine)
that provide different targets to inhibit alone or in combination.37 Better preclinical models are needed to develop
combinations of drugs more rationally. Animal models of
renal cancer use a very limited number of long-term
human RCC cell lines. These xenografts require an
immunosuppressed host, and both the stroma and tumor
vascularity are murine in origin. A tumor model driven by
the VHL transgene may provide much greater insight into
human CCRCC. These models would help define biomarkers that can be used for defining clinical benefit
before imaging confirmation. Everolimus, an oral mTOR
inhibitor, probably will be approved rapidly based on its
strong results in patients who failed on multiple prior regimens, including multitargeted kinase inhibitors. This provides an opportunity to expand the clinical evaluation of
this agent in combination therapy.11
Planned Randomized Clinical Trials
Two large trials recently have started enrollment or soon
will be underway. The 2 trials are outlined in Table 4.
Cancer

May 15, 2009

The BeST (ECOG 2804) trial is a randomized phase 2
trial examining doublets of sorafenib, bevacizumab, and
temsirolimus plus an arm with bevacizumab alone. This
4-arm trial will enroll a minimum of 90 patients per arm
and is designed to determine whether any arm appears
promising compared with bevacizumab. It is estimated
that the PFS for bevacizumab is 9 months, and a doublet
arm would be promising if the PFS was 15 months. The
other trial is a large randomized phase 3 trial of the AVOREN phase 3 arm of bevacizumab plus interferon versus
bevacizumab plus temsirolimus based on Merchan’s small
phase 1 experience.10,29 This trial will enroll >400
patients per arm worldwide and hopes to achieve an extension of PFS from 10.2 months with bevacizumab plus
interferon to 13.5 months with bevacizumab plus temsirolimus. Additional phase 2 experience with bevacizumab
plus temsirolimus will be available before the initiation of
this trial.
Combination Targeted Drug Therapy:
Lessons and Recommendations
Many agents are available for combination therapy of
CCRCC, but many have redundant mechanisms of
action. Adverse event profiles can compromise drug dose
delivery, exacerbate toxic effects, and even reduce efficacy
compared with a drug’s single-agent clinical activity. Still,
we have limited information on toxicity and how it may
differ, depending on the cancer undergoing therapy and
the drug used. We need to obtain more experience with
long-term administration of some combination treatments. We still need to prioritize studies that have as their
objective a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance and how to prevent or circumvent resistance. It
will be important to develop new targets for therapy that
are critical for cancer cell survival and not part of a redundant pathway. Finally, we need to identify the biologic

characteristics of tumors that respond to specific agents
and identify biomarkers to define responses early in treatment. There still is significant clinical work needed to
define the role for combination therapy, but we have
developed the basis to move forward.
