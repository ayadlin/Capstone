ABSTRACT
Morphine is an opioid analgesic drug commonly used for pain relief in cancer
patients. Here, we report that morphine enhances the mammosphere forming capacity
and increases the expression of stemness-related transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and
Nanog. Treatment with morphine leads to enrichment of a side population fraction in
MCF-7 cells and the CD44+/CD24−/low population in BT549 cells. Consistently, morphine
activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition and
promotes metastasis. Moreover, morphine decreases the sensitivity of traditional anticancer drugs in breast cancer cells. Nalmefene, an antagonist of morphine, reverses
morphine-induced cancer stem cell properties and chemoresistance in breast cancer.
In addition, nalmefene abolishes morphine enhancing tumorigenesis in a NOD/SCID
mouse model. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that morphine contributes to
chemoresistance via expanding the population of cancer stem cells and promotes
tumor growth, thereby revealing a novel role of morphine and providing some new
guides in clinical use of morphine.

capacity [3]. BCSCs are more resistant to traditional
chemotherapy than non-BCSCs [4]. The chemoresistance
of BCSCs is tightly regulated by the following
mechanisms: 1. the elevation of the ABC transporters
that function to efflux chemotherapeutic drugs [5]; 2. the
differentiation ability of CSCs to regenerate heterogeneous
cancer cells [6, 7]; 3. the enrichment of CSCs during
therapeutic intervention may contribute to the genesis of
CSCs and increase the fraction of CSCs [8]. Thus targeting
CSCs is the current challenge for the development of anticancer treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms by
which CSCs contribute to drug resistance remain to be
determined.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women
worldwide [1]. Breast cancer contains a subpopulation
of self-renewing cells that resemble mammary stem
cells. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) first isolated by
surface marker CD44+/CD24−/low possess the characteristic
of unlimited self-renewal and are able to generate
differentiated descendants [2]. Inoculation of small
numbers of CD44+/CD24−/low breast cancer cells in NOD/
SCID mice can recapitulate the phenotypic heterogeneity
of the parent tumor, whereas cells lacking the CD44+/
CD24−/low marker have a greatly reduced tumor-forming

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a
transdifferentiation program that is initially recognized
as a key step for morphogenesis during embryonic
development [9]. Recent advance indicates that EMT
plays an important role during the development of
drug resistance in breast cancer. Elevated expression
of E-cadherin enhances the sensitivity of EGFR kinase
inhibitors and the drug resistant cells are found to be with
more mesenchymal-like characteristic [10]. Moreover,
EMT is also involved in paclitaxel-resistance of breast
cancer cells. Accordingly the resistant cells display EMT
features and increase invasion and migration [11].
Opioids, such as morphine, are the most potent
analgesics, which have been extensively used for
anesthetic pre-medication and management of cancer
pain with cancer metastasis. Currently, both morphine
and anticancer drugs have been simultaneously given to
patients, especially those patients with cancer metastasis.
However, emerging evidence showed that morphine
had extra analgesic effects that appeared to alter tumor
progression by activating non-classical opioid receptor
signaling. Morphine induces phosphorylation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) via opioid receptors,
promotes cell proliferation and increases cell invasion [12].
Morphine also activates MAPK/ERK by phosphorylation
via PTX-sensitive GPCRs and NO, which leads to the
promotion of tumor growth in breast cancer [13]. In
addition, morphine promotes breast cancer cell migration
and invasion by increasing the expression of NET1 [14].
Until now, little attention has been paid to the development
of drug resistance during application of morphine.
Therefore, the key aim of this study was to address
whether morphine played important roles in regulating
cancer stem cell properties, which were closely correlated
with the chemoresistance of cancer cells and tumor
malignancy. In the present study, we found that the
application of morphine in MCF-7 and BT549 cells
enriched cancer stem cell populations and contributed to
the development of chemoresistance. We also found that
morphine enhanced the tumorigenicity of breast cancer
cells, which could be blocked by nalmefene in NOD/SCID
mouse model. Our study also suggested that morphine
contributed to the acquired chemoresistance in breast cancer.
These results revealed the possible side effects of morphine
in cancer development and chemoresistance, which may
provide some guides in the clinical use of morphine.

in breast cells. Mammosphere formation assay has been
used as a surrogate reporter of stem cell activity in the
mammary gland [22] and cancer stem cell activity [23].
We treated MCF-7, BT549 and MCF-10A cells with
morphine (0, 1, 10 μM), and performed a sphere formation
assay [24, 25]. Results showed that morphine significantly
increased the sphere size and number in both MCF-7 cells
(Figure 1A) and BT549 cells (Figure 1B). Similar results
were observed in non-transforming mammary epithelial
cell MCF-10A (Figure 1C). For side population assay, we
pretreated MCF-7 cells with morphine (10 μM) for 14 days,
passaged cells with fresh medium containing morphine
every 2 days and performed side population assay coupled
with flow cytometry analysis. Our results showed that
side population fraction increased from 0.63 ± 0.30% to
3.4 ± 0.15% compared with the untreated group in MCF7 cells (Figure 1D). Since CD44+/CD24– were widely
used as a cell surface marker of CSCs, we next detected
the expression of CD44+/CD24– in breast cancer cells
treated with morphine (10 μM) and found that the CD44+/
CD24– proportion were increased from 47.87 ± 1.01% to
68.8 ± 2.68% in BT549 cells (Figure 1E). These results
demonstrate that morphine increases the tumorsphereforming ability and enriches cancer stem cells, indicating
that morphine enhances the self-renewal capacity in breast
cancer cells and normal mammary epithelial cells.

Morphine increases the expression of Sox2, Oct4
and Nanog
Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog are transcription factors that
play key roles in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic
stem cells [26–28]. To explore the underlying mechanism
by which morphine promotes the CSC properties of breast
cancer cells, we examined the expression of Sox2, Oct4 and
Nanog following morphine treatment. Firstly, we examined
the mRNA levels of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in MCF-7 and
BT549 cells treated with morphine by Q-PCR. Morphine
significantly increased the mRNA levels of Oct4, Sox2 and
Nanog in both MCF-7 and BT549 cells. In comparison to
untreated controls, the mRNA levels of Oct4, Sox2 and
Nanog were increased respectively by 13.08 ± 2.29, 10.57
± 1.42 and 19.18 ± 0.85 folds in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2A),
while 6.15 ± 0.61, 10.37 ± 0.91 and 14.92 ± 1.47 folds in
BT549 cells (Figure 2B). Consistently, western blot assay
showed that morphine dose dependent increased the protein
levels of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog in MCF-7 (Figure 2C) and
BT549 cells (Figure 2D). These data suggest that morphine
may promote cancer stem cell properties by up-regulating
Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog.

marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal marker N-cadherin
in MCF-7 and BT549 cells using Q-PCR, western blot
and immunofluorence staining. Morphine decreased the
mRNA level of CDH1 but increased the mRNA levels
of CDH2 and CTNNB1 in both MCF-7 (Figure 3A) and
BT549 (Figure 3B) cells. Consistently, morphine decreased
the expression of E-cadherin but increased the expression
of N-cadherin and β-catenin in MCF-7 (Figure 3C) and
BT549 (Figure 3D) cells. Moreover, the immunofluorence
staining results also showed that morphine decreased the
expression of E-cadherin while increased the expression
of N-cadherin and β-catenin in both MCF-7 (Figure 3E)
and BT549 (Figure 3F) cells. Furthermore, we investigated
the expression of β-catenin in cytoplasma and nucleus
individually for Wnt/β-catenin activation. Results showed
that β-catenin increased its expression in nucleus but not in
cytoplasma in both MCF-7 (Figure 3G) and BT549 (Figure
3H) cells. Meanwhile, as EMT is a key process in cancer
metastasis [31], we examined the role of morphine in tumor
metastasis by transwell assay. Results showed that morphine
could significantly enhance cell migration and invasion
abilities in BT549 cell (Figure 3I). These results suggest that
morphine promotes EMT and metastasis in breast cancer.

The promotion of the side population proportion
suggests that morphine may mediate chemoresistance.
To demonstrate this hypothesis, we firstly treated MCF-7
and BT549 cells with increasing concentrations of
doxorubicin or paclitaxel and analyzed cell viability
by MTT assay after 24 and 48 hours. Both doxorubicin
and paclitaxel decreased cell proliferation in a dosage
dependent manner of MCF-7 and BT549 cells (Figure
S1). We next investigated whether morphine was able to
reduce the sensitivity of BT549 cells to chemotherapy.
Cells were pretreated with morphine for 4 days, followed
by incubated with doxorubicin (0.5 μM) or paclitaxel (10
nM) for another 2 days. Our results showed that morphine
(1 μM or 10 μM) alone did not apparently alter the cell
viability, but significantly abolished the loss of cell
viability induced by doxorubicin (Figure 4A) or paclitaxel
(Figure 4B). We further analyzed the effect of morphine
on doxorubicin or paclitaxel induced apoptosis in breast
cancer cells by assessing cleaved PARP and caspase-3
by western blot. Our results showed that doxorubicin

Nalmefene reverses morphine-induced cancer
stem cell properties and chemoresistance

some side-effect on breast cancer patients who receive
chemotherapy. In this study, we find that morphine
could increase mammosphere forming ability and enrich
cancer stem cell population of MCF-7, BT549 and
MCF-10A cells (Figure 1), accompanies with increasing
expression of stem cell related genes in human breast
cancer cells (Figure 2). Meanwhile, morphine promotes
EMT and metastasis in breast cancer cells (Figure 3). In
addition, long-time using morphine leads to resistance
of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel and doxorubicin
(Figure 4). Furthermore, nalmefene could reverse the
effect of morphine on breast cancer stem cell proportion,
chemoresistance (Figure 5) and tumorigenesis (Figure 6).
A previous study showed that morphine displayed
anticancer activity and inhibited the activation of nuclear
transcription factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) [32]. Morphine decreases
cell proliferation in many human cancer cells including
breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer
[33–36]. Moreover, morphine induces G1 cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis by stimulating the phosphorylation of p53
at Ser9 and/or Ser15 [37]. Furthermore, long-term using of
morphine to mice with transplanted neuroblastoma tumors
inhibits tumor growth and prolongs the survival time, which
can be abolished by morphine antagonist, naloxone [38, 39].
We speculated that the discrepancies might be resulted from
different morphine doses used, route of administration, and/
or plasma doses achieved at steady state.
Numerous studies have indicated that acquired drug
resistance could attribute to the presence of CSCs [30, 40].
For instance, phosphorylated STAT3 promoted the stemlike cell phenotype in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells, which was resistant to Herceptin [41]. Similarly,
miR125 maintained cancer stem-like side population
fraction, which was higher expression in chemotherapy
resistant patients than in chemotherapy responsive patients
[42]. In consistent, our study showed morphine promoted
the stem-like cell phenotype and induced EMT, which
could contribute to the chemoresistance.
Stem cell markers Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog play
pivotal roles in cancer development and drug resistance
[43]. Our findings show that morphine significantly
increased these stem cell markers supporting the notion
that long-time using morphine leads to enrichment of stem
cell properties and drug resistance.
EMT, characterized by the loss of epithelial
differentiation and gain of mesenchymal phenotype,
accompanied with metastasis and drug resistance, is tightly
linked with the biology of CSCs [44]. Recent studies have
demonstrated that the induction of immortalized human
mammary epithelial cells into mesenchymal phenotype,
resulting in the loss of epithelial phenotype and the
acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype, concomitant with
the acquisition of CD44+/CD24–/low expression pattern [45].
Another report observed that the induction of EMT by CD8+
T cells led to the outgrowth of tumor in vivo. Interestingly,
the mesenchymal tumor cells with a CD44+/CD24–/low

To extend our observations, we further used
nalmefene, an antagonist of morphine, to test
whether it could reverse the functions of morphine in
chemoresistance. Nalmefene alone had no significant
effect on cell proliferation, and combination with
morphine and nalmefene did not rescue the cell death
caused by doxorubicin or paclitaxel (Figure 5A–5B).
Compared to morphine with doxorubicin or paclitaxel,
combination with morphine, nalmefene and doxorbicin (or
paclitaxel) increased the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3.
In contrast, combining morphine with anticancer drugs
decreased the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 in
comparison to doxorubicin or paclitaxel alone (Figure
5C–5D). Moreover, compared with morphine alone,
nalmefene plus morphine increased the apoptosis rate
caused by doxorubicin or paclitaxel (Figure 5E–5F).
Furthermore, nalmefene alone did not have significant
effect on the sphereformation ability. However, treatment
with nalmefene and morphine resulted in a decreased
sphere numbers and diameters compared with morphine
alone (Figure 5G). Taken together, these results indicate
that nalmefene could reverse the effect of morphine in
both sphere forming ability and chemoresistance.

Nalmefene reverses morphine-increased
tumorigenesis
To investigate whether morphine could promote
cancer development and the effect could be blocked by
nalmefene in vivo, we established a NOD/SCID mouse
model. BT549 cells were subcutaneously injected into mice
and following treatment as mentioned. As we expected, no
significant difference was found in tumor growth between
the normal saline control group and the nalmefene group,
which indicated that nalmefene had little effect on tumor
growth. Compared with the normal saline group, morphine
group showed a litter larger tumor volume on day 21 and a
2.1-fold larger tumor volume on day 36 (Figure 6A–6B). In
contrast, the morphine plus nalmefene group demonstrated
a decrease of tumor growth on day 24 and a 2.0-fold
smaller tumor volume on day 42 in comparison to the
morphine group (Figure 6A–6B). All the mice injected with
morphine (all of 10) formed tumors, while 3 of 10 mice
injected with saline or nalmefene failed to form tumors
(Figure 6C). These results indicate that morphine promotes
tumorigenesis which can be reversed by nalmefene.

DISCUSSION
Most breast cancer patients use morphine to
relieve severe pain. However, morphine contributes to
the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells,
suggesting that long-term using morphine may render

phenotype could re-establish an epithelial tumor and exhibit
drug resistance, which resembled the characteristics of
breast CSCs [46]. In our study, morphine induced EMT by
elevating the expression of nuclear β-catenin and promoted
metastasis in breast cancer cells. Taken together, these
reports and our study strongly suggest that the induction of
EMT could generate stem-like cells.
Nalmefene, an opiate derivative, is similar to the
opiate antagonist naltrexone in structure and activity,
which targets mu-, delta-, and kappa-binding sites
[47–49]. In the present study, we found that nalmefene
could reverse the effect of morphine in promoting breast
cancer stemness and chemoresistance of doxorubicin and
paclitaxel. In our study, nalmefene (10 μM) alone had no
effect on cell growth, apoptosis and sphere-forming ability
(Figure 5). Moreover, preclinical and clinical studies have
demonstrated that co-treatment with extremely low doses
of opioid receptor antagonists can markedly enhance the
efficacy and specificity of morphine and simultaneously
attenuate opioid tolerance and dependence [50]. Thus,
combination with morphine and low dosage of nalmefene
would be more effective in cancer treatment without
increasing drug resistance and aggressiveness.
In conclusion, we have uncovered the direct effects
of morphine on inducing cancer stem cell properties and
chemoresistance in breast cancer. Our data demonstrated
that morphine led to chemoresistance of doxorubicin
and paclitaxel. Thus, we suggest that combination with
morphine and nalmefene improve the effectiveness of
anti-tumour therapies. However, further clinical studies
are needed to extend our observations and the potential
mechanism is under pursuing in our lab.

purchased from Sigma was dissolved in DMSO to a stock
concentration of 2 mM and stored at −20°C. Doxrubicin
was purchased from KeyGene (China). Paclitaxel
(Cell Signaling Technology) was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock concentration of 1 mM and
stored at −20°C.

MTT assay
MTT (Sigma) assay was used to assess the growth
of breast cancer cells. Cells (2.5–5 × 103) were plated in
96-well flat bottom plates in a final volume of 200 μl.
When attached to the flat, cells were exposed to drugs for
24 to 48 hours. Cell survival was assessed as described
previously [15].

Immunofluorescence staining
Immunofluorescence staining of cells was
performed as previously described [16]. Briefly, cells were
fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde-PBS at room temperature
for 20 minutes and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100
in PBS for 10 minutes at 4°C. Cells were then blocked
with 3% BSA and incubated with primary antibody against
E-cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology), N-cadherin
(Abcam) and β-catenin (Millipore) followed by a FITC
conjugated second antibody (Invitrogen), counterstained
with DAPI (1 μg/ml) and visualized using a confocal
microscope (Leica).

Transwell migration and invasion assays
For migration assay, cells (5 × 104) pretreated with
morphine (0, 1, 10 μM) for 4 days were resuspended in
culture medium with the same concentration of morphine
and placed into uncoated membrane in the upper
chamber (24-well insert, 8 μm, Corning Costar). DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS was used as an attractant in
the lower chamber. After being incubated for 24 hours,
cells migrated through the membrane were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyle (Santa Cruz) and stained with 1%
crystal violet (Shanghai Sangon Company). The stained
cell images were captured by microscope (Olympus), and
five random fields at 10× magnification were counted.
Results represented the average of triplicate samples from
three independent experiments.
For invasion assays, cells (8 × 104) were placed
into 50 μl matrigel (BD Biosciences) coated membrane
in upper chamber and being incubated for 36 hours.
Following steps were similar with migration assays.

against CD44 FITC (BD Pharmingen) and CD24 PerCPCy5.5 (BD Pharmingen) for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark.
Unbound antibody was washed away through two cycles
of washing with PBS. Then cells were analyzed on a BD
FACS Calibur flow cytometer. These data were analyzed
by Cellquest Pro and at least 20,000 events per sample
were collected.

Side population assay
MCF-7 cells (106/ml) were incubated with 2 μM
FTC, ABCG2-specific inhibitor, for 20 minutes in negative
control tubes before adding Hoechst 33342. Then MCF-7
cells were incubated in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solutions
(HBSS) supplemented with 2% FBS, 10 mM HEPES,
5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 90 minutes at 37°C with
intermittent mixing, followed by washing with cold
medium. Cells were resuspended at 2x106 cells/ml. PI was
added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml to discriminate
dead cells. The gating of side population was based on
negative controls in which FTC was used. Then cells
were analyzed on a BD FACScalibur flow cytometer. At
least 100,000 events per sample were collected for data
analysis.

Mouse xenograft assay
BT549 cells (6 × 106) in 100 μl were subcutaneously
injected at the right dorsal flank of female mice (4–6
week, 18–25 g, Dalian, China). Mice were treated
subcutaneously every day with saline (n = 5), nalmefene
(n = 5), morphine (n = 5), or nalmefene plus morphine
(n = 5) right after tumor cell implantation. Due to the
potential desensitization of opioid receptors, the dose
of morphine and nalmefene were increased stepwise (5,
10 and 15 mg/kg s.c. for every two weeks). For drug
combination, the nalmefene dose was one-tenth of the
morphine dose because this ratio is generally considered to
result in a complete antagonism of antinociceptive effects
of morphine [17]. The body weight of the animals and
the two perpendicular diameters (a and b) were recorded
every 3 days. Tumor volume (V) was calculated according
to the following formula: V = (a*b*b)/2 [18]. Forty-two
days after caudal intravenous injection, the mice were
euthanized and dissected. The protocol was performed
as previously described [19]. All animal procedures were
approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Dalian
Medical University.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen), which was used to generate cDNA by
using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) with an oligo-dT
primer. Q-PCR was performed using Platinum SYBR
Green qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) as recommended
by the manufacturer. The primers used were listed in
Supplementary Table 1. ACTB was used as the internal
control.

Sphere formation assay

Statistical analysis

Sphere formation was performed in ultralow
attachment plates (Corning) with medium supplemented
with 2% B27, 20 ng/ml bFGF, and 20 ng/ml EGF. BT549
and MCF7 cells were planted at the density around 2
cells/μl and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2. After 14 days,
the spheres greater than 50 μm diameter were counted at
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Each experiment was performed in triplicate and
repeated at least three times. The differences in mean values
among groups were evaluated and expressed as the mean ±
SD. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).

Student’s t-test was used to compare the expressions
of cell surface markers, side population analysis, cell
viability, relative mRNA levels, migrated cells and
invaded cells. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare
the sphere volumes. The ANOVA test was used to compare
the tumor volume.
