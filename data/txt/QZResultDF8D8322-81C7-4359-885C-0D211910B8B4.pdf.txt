ABSTRACT
Tumor recurrence remains an obstacle after liver surgery, especially in living
donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). The acute-phase liver graft injury might potentially induce poor response
to chemotherapy in recurrent HCC after liver transplantation. We here intended
to explore the mechanism and to identify a therapeutic target to overcome such
chemoresistance. The associations among graft injury, overexpression of IP10 and
multidrug resistant genes were investigated in a rat liver transplantation model, and
further validated in clinical cohort. The role of IP10 on HCC cell proliferation and tumor
growth under chemotherapy was studied both in vitro and in vivo. The underlying
mechanism was revealed by detecting the activation of endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress signaling pathways. Moreover, the effect of IP10 neutralizing antibody
sensitizing cisplatin treatment was further explored. In rat liver transplantation
model, significant up-regulation of IP10 associated with multidrug resistant genes
was found in small-for-size liver graft. Clinically, high expression of circulating
IP10 was significant correlated with tumor recurrence in HCC patients underwent
LDLT. Overexpression of IP10 promoted HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth
under cisplatin treatment by activation of ATF6/Grp78 signaling. IP10 neutralizing
antibody sensitized cisplatin treatment in nude mice. The overexpression of IP10,
which induced by liver graft injury, may lead to cisplatin resistance via ATF6/Grp78
ER stress signaling pathway. IP10 neutralizing antibody could be a potential adjuvant
therapy to sensitize cisplatin treatment.

Chemotherapy, as an alternative treatment for HCC, had a
remarkable response rate in primary liver cancer [7–11].
However, it had no benefit on recurrent HCC patients [12].
The reason for this difference was still unclear.
Living donor liver transplantation presents greater
risks of liver graft injury due to the small size of donor
liver [13]. From an analysis of 16 clinical cohorts, the
tumor recurrent rate is significantly higher due to the
graft injury in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT)
group compared with deceased donor liver transplantation

INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation is a promising treatment for the
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the 3 year
survival rate of liver transplantation for HCC was up to 80%
and the 5 year survival rate reached 75% [1–3]. However,
the tumor recurrence is still the most serious threat to HCC
patients after liver transplantation. Although many adjuvant
therapies were applied to minimize the recurrent rate, the
5-year tumor recurrent rates ranged from 8% to 56% [4–6].

(DDLT) group [14]. In our recent studies, we have
demonstrated the significance of acute phase graft injury
on late phase tumor growth and invasiveness after liver
transplantation in animal models [15]. The inflammatory
response resulted from hepatic I/R injury not only
provided a favorable environment for tumor growth, but
also promoted tumor cell invasiveness [16]. Furthermore,
chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (IP10) was identified
as a distinct gene signature of acute-phase graft injury
and late-phase tumor recurrence after liver transplantation
[17]. Post-transplant enhanced IP10 signaling in smallfor-size liver grafts not only directly promoted tumor cell
proliferation and invasiveness [17], but also mobilized
circulating endothelial progenitor cells into liver graft and
further promoted tumor angiogenesis during liver tumor
recurrence after liver transplantation [18].
IP10, as a secretory protein, is secreted by many
types, including leukocytes, activated neutrophils,
eosinophils [19], monocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial
cells, stromal cells and keratinocytes in response to IFN-γ
[17]. IP10 played crucial roles in interferon responses
including attraction of activated lymphocytes, monocytes,
T cells and NK cells to inflammatory area [20]. Highly
expression of IP10 was found in infectious diseases,
inflammatory [21, 22], autoimmune diseases [23], and
variety of cancer diseases. IP10 and its downstream signals
were considered to be potential therapeutic targets in
attenuation of acute phase graft injury and prevention of
tumor recurrence after liver transplantation using small-forsize graft [17]. Increasing evidence suggested that ER stress
was associated with graft injury and HCC recurrence after
transplantation, but no studies specifically focused on the
underlying mechanism [24]. It is worthwhile to explore the
crosstalk between graft injury induced IP10 overexpression
and the activation of ER stress after liver transplantation.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a specialized
organelle that plays a central role in biosynthesis,
correcting protein folding, and posttranslational
modifications of secretory and membrane proteins. The
activation of ER stress not only played important roles in
graft injury during organ transplantation [24, 25], but also
regulated cisplatin-induced cell death and drug resistance
[26]. There are contradictory reports regarding the role
of ER stress response in cancer [27]. Although there
were indications that ER stress may provide protection
against cancer [28, 29], plenty of examples suggested
that the activation of ER stress signaling was essential for
cancer cell survival and tumor recurrence [30, 31]. Tumor
recurrence requires the residue circulating HCC cells
which escaped from immune surveillance [32]. Recurrent
HCC could also developed resistance to adjuvant
therapies after liver transplantation [32]. However, the
role of graft injury induced IP10 overexpression on
post-transplanted chemoresistance is still unknown.
As a distinct gene signature of acute-phase graft injury
and tumor recurrence [17], IP10 might be the key factor

bridging graft injury to chemoresistance in recurrent HCC
after liver transplantation. IP10 neutralizing antibody
might provide a potential adjuvant therapy to attenuate
chemo-resistance in recurrent HCC.
In this study, we proposed that IP10 may promote
cisplatin resistance after liver transplantation by activating
ER stress signaling pathways. IP10 neutralizing antibody
might sensitize cisplatin treatment in HCC.

RESULTS
Over expression of IP10 correlated with
chemoresistance genes in rat liver transplantation
­
model
In rat liver transplantation model, IP10 was found
to be overexpressed in tumor and liver tissues from smallfor-size group at day 14 and day21 (Figure 1A). Several
multidrug resistant genes including ABCB1, ABCG2,
Bcl-2, CFTR and STAT1 were also overexpressed in
small-for-size group compared with whole graft group
(Figure 1B–1C).
Higher circulating IP10 correlated with tumor
recurrence in HCC recipients
Significant elevation of circulating IP10 expressions
was observed at acute phase (day 1) after liver
transplantation by comparing with that at Day 0 and Day 7
(Figure 1D).
Circulating IP10 in recurrent group was significantly
higher than that in non-recurrence group at day1 (677 ± 101
pg/ml vs 341 ± 93 pg/ml, p = 0.027) and day 7 (204 ± 32
pg/ml vs 123 ± 11 pg/ml, p = 0.039) (Figure 1E). Moreover,
circulating IP10 expression in small-for-size group was
significantly higher than that in whole graft group at day
1 (251 ± 53 pg/ml vs 119 ± 10 pg/ml, p = 0.013) and day
7 (251 ± 53 pg/ml vs 94 ± 11 pg/ml, p = 0.02) (Figure 1F).
IP10 induced cisplatin resistance in HCC cells
According to the expression level of IP10, six HCC
cell lines were assigned into 2 groups, (1) lower IP10
expressed group (LO2, PLC HepG2 and MHCC97L)
and (2) higher IP10 expressed group (Hep3B and Huh7)
(Supplementary Figure S3).
Extracellular function of IP10 on HCC cell lines
IP10 recombinant protein (r-IP10) was applied to
elevate the extracellular concentration of IP10 in cell culture
environment. Elevation of extracellular IP10 significantly
promoted HCC cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure S2).
After 2 weeks of cisplatin administrated with/
without r-IP10, there was no significant difference of cell
proliferation rate in HCC cell lines with high expression
of IP10—Hep3B and Huh7 (Figure 2A). r-IP10 could
significantly promote HCC cell survive in PLC and
MHCC97L under different concentrations of cisplatin
treatment (Figure 2B).

Intracellular function of IP10 on HCC cell lines

In orthotopic liver tumor nude mice model with
hepatic IR injury

The full length of IP10 was transfected into
2 HCC cell lines (PLC and MHCC97L) with low IP10
expression. The mRNA expression level of IP10 in stable
transfectants were significantly higher than primary HCC
cell lines, from 10 to 600 folds. Among them, PLC-IP10-3
and MHCC97L-IP10-1, with high IP10 expression were
chosen for further studies (Supplementary Figure S4).
Several multi-drug resistant genes including
ABCB1, ABCG2 and CFTR were up-regulated in both
PLC-IP10 and MHCC97L-IP10. Expressions of MAP7,
STAT1 and AKT also showed higher expression in IP10
stable transfectants (Supplementary Figure S5).
HCC cell proliferation rate was significantly higher
in IP10 overexpression stable transfectant after 72 hours of
cisplatin administration. When the concentration of cisplatin
raised up to 9 μM, 12 μM and 15 μM, the percentages of
viable cell of MHCC97L-IP10 was significantly higher
compared to MHCC97L-3.1 (9 μM : 65.5 ± 5.7% vs 32.9
± 6.6% , p = 0.027; 12 μM: 50.1 ± 4.3% vs 24.5 ± 1.9%,
p = 0.019; 15 μM: 38.3 ± 9.1 vs 17.3 ± 6.4%, p = 0.035).
The IC50 of cisplatin in MHCC97L-IP10 was around 1.6fold higher than MHCC97L (Figure 2C). This result was
also confirmed by colony formation assay (Figure 2D).
The percentages of viable cell of PLC-IP10
was significantly higher than PLC-3.1 under cisplatin
administration (6 μM: 67.9 ± 10.1% vs 38.2 ± 4.3%,
p = 0.04; 8 μM: 42.4 ± 2.7% vs 30.1 ± 4.0%, p = 0.035;
10 μM: 39.1 ± 4.7% vs 13.2 ± 11.5%, p = 0.031). The
IC50 of cisplatin in PLC-IP10 was around 1.5-fold than
PLC-3.1 (Figure 2E). This result was also confirmed by
colony formation assay (Figure 2F).
In summary, overexpression of IP10 significantly
promoted HCC cell proliferation and colony forming
ability in PLC and MHCC97L HCC cell lines.

One group of nude mice was subjected to half an hour
ischemia before tumor implantation. Cisplatin was given to
these nude mice 2 weeks after tumor nodule implantation.
According to the optical imaging, tumor size from IR injury
group was larger compared to the control group after 3 and 4
weeks of cisplatin treatment (Figure 4A). The tumor volume
was confirmed to be significantly larger in IR injury group by
comparing with control group (14.9 ± 8.9 mm3 vs 65.5 ± 20.1
mm3, p = 0.01) (Figure 4B). The circulating IP10 expression
in IR injury group was around 1700 pg/ml which was 9-fold
of its expression in control group (Figure 4C). The circulating
IP10 in IR injury nude mice models was significantly higher
than subcutaneous and Orthotopic models. (SubcutaneousIP10 group: 413.9 pg/ml; Orthtopic-IP10: 433.2 pg/ml; I/R
group: 1672.3 pg/ml, p < 0.01) (Figure 4D)
In summary, IP10 overexpression was induced
by hepatic IR injury. IP10 overexpression significantly
promoted tumor growth and attenuated tumor cell
apoptosis under cisplatin treatment.

IP10 activated ER stress signaling pathway
ER stress includes three main pathways. One of them
functions as anti-apoptotic effect with the key molecules
ATF6/Grp78, other two pathways promote cell apoptosis by
the activation of PERK-CHOP and IRE1α. In order to reveal
the correlations between IP10 up-regulation and the activation
of ER stress, the expressions of these key molecules were
investigated in in vitro, in vivo and clinical samples.
In in vitro experiments
MHCC97L-IP10 and MHCC97L-3.1 were
administrated by different concentrations of cisplatin for
2 weeks. The expression of IP10, ATF6, Grp78, PERK,
CHOP and IRE1 were examined. The anti-apoptotic
factors (ATF6/Grp78) were significantly up-regulated by
Cisplatin treatment in MHCC97L-IP10 group. It implied
that over-expression of IP10 may induce chemo-resistance
in HCC cells. Expressions of pro-apoptotic factors (PERK/
CHOP) had a cisplatin dose dependant increasing in
MHCC97L-3.1 group (Figure 5A). The expression of
IRE1α did not have any significant difference.

IP10 promoted tumor growth under cisplatin
treatment in animal models
In subcutaneous nude mice model
Average tumor volume from MHCC97L-IP10
was significantly larger than the control group after 3
weeks of cisplatin treatment (Figure 3A). Tumor growth
rate was significantly higher in MHCC97L-IP10 group
(Figure 3B). H&E and TUNEL staining demonstrated that
tumor necrosis and tumor cell apoptosis was attenuated
in MHCC97L-IP10 group (Figure 3C). These results
demonstrated that IP10 overexpression could stimulate
tumor growth and alleviate tumor necrosis, tumor cell
apoptosis under cisplatin treatment.

In animal model
In nude mice liver tumor model with hepatic IR
injury, Grp78 and ATF were found to be significantly
overexpressed in tumor tissue. A positive correlation was
observed between overexpression of IP10 and the activation
of Grp78 and ATF6 (Figure 5B). However, expressions of
PERK, CHOP, IRE1α and Caspase12 did not show any
significant change (Supplementary Figure S5).

In orthotopic liver tumor nude mice model
The tumor volume of MHCC97L-IP10 (268.3 ±
109.3 mm3) was significantly larger than the control group
(90.2 ± 60.5 mm3) at the end point of this study (p = 0.041)
(Figure 3D–3E). Tumor necrosis and tumor cell apoptosis
was attenuated in MHCC97L-IP10 group (Figure 3F).

In clinical cohort
Intragraft IP10 was found to be overexpressed in HCC
recipients, especially in the recurrent group (Figure 5C).

Consistent with the up-regulation of IP10, the expression of
Grp78 and ATF6 were significantly increased in liver tissues
from the patients with HCC recurrence (Figure 5D–5E).
The expression of PERK and CHOP was also up-regulated
in the recurrent group (Figure 5F). There was no significant
difference in the expression of IRE1α and Caspase12
(Supplementary Figure S5).

We also illustrated that over-expression of IP10 in
HCC cells significantly promoted HCC cell proliferation
and colony forming ability under cisplatin administration
in vitro. In animal studies, three animal models were
established to elaborate the relationships among IP10,
graft injury and cisplatin resistance. IP10 could promote
tumor growth and alleviate tumor necrosis under cisplatin
treatment in both subcutaneous and orthotopic nude mice
models. By comparing these three animal models, the IP10
up-regulation was induced by three different ways. Two of
them were established by using IP10 stable transfectants
and one was induced by IR injury. The result showed that
the circulating IP10 expression was significant higher in
IR injury model. In clinical samples, graft injury could
induce the up-regulation of circulating IP10, which had
significant correlations with HCC recurrent rate and
small graft ratio. These data indicated that IP10 may
have prognostic value to predict tumor progression and
recurrence. It also confirmed the significant effect of
IR injury on IP10 overexpression which could further
promote tumor growth and invasiveness under cisplatin
treatment. Cisplatin-induced DNA damage activates
various signaling pathways to prevent or promote cell
death, predominantly via apoptosis [33]. It was recently
demonstrated that cisplatin could induce endoplasmic
reticulum stress (ER stress) and non-nucleus-dependent
apoptotic signal activation [34]. Currently, ER stress was
considered to play crucial roles in cisplatin-induced tumor
cell death as a cell stress signaling receptor. By examining
the correlations between IP10 and the activation of ER
stress, we may understand the underlying mechanism of
IP10 overexpression induced chemo-resistance in HCC.
ER stress was regulated by the unfolded protein
response (UPR) system. When the unexpected unfolded
proteins were limited in the tolerable range, the UPR
system could activate to restore the balance. If the stress
was continuous, the UPR system could not restore the
balance in prolonged ER stress and conduct programming
death itself [35]. However, cancer cells could adapt to
chronic stress in the tumor microenvironment by inducing
the expression of GRP78/BiP, a major endoplasmic
reticulum chaperone and anti-apoptotic properties.
These residue cancer cells were responsible for tumor
recurrence and associated with an unfavorable prognosis.
In this study, IP10 was identified to play a key role in
mediating the activation of ER stress and assisting posttransplant HCC cell survival via ATF6/Grp78 in our
in vitro and in vivo experiments, further validated clinical
samples. Graft injury induced IP10 overexpression was
firstly demonstrated to be significantly correlated with the
activation of ATF6/Grp78, which were key molecules in
the anti-apoptotic pathway of ER stress signaling. IP10
might urge HCC cell survive from the ER stress and
these cells might become more aggressive and resistant
to chemotherapy due to the activation of ATF6/Grp78.
However, several other proteins were also found to be

IP10 neutralization antibody sensitized cisplatin
treatment
In in vitro studies
IP10 neutralizing antibody was applied as a
combination treatment in PLC-IP10 and MHCC97L-IP10.
HCC cell proliferation was significantly suppressed under
cisplatin administration combined with IP10 antibody. The
IC50 was significantly decreased in cells treated with the
cisplatin and IP10 antibody (Figure 6A). IP10 antibody
could also significantly suppress colony forming ability
both in MHCC97L-IP10 and PLC-IP10 (Figure 6B).
In orthotopic nude mice liver tumor model
Fourteen days after tumor nodule implantation
(Supplementary Figure S6), single cisplatin or combination
with IP10 neutralizing antibody was given respectively.
By comparing luciferin signal, the tumor growth was
suppressed in IP10 neutralizing antibody combined
with cisplatin group after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. The
tumor growth was significantly suppressed in combine
treatment group by comparing with the cisplatin single
treatment group (p = 0.012) (Figure 6C and Supplementary
Figure  S7). The treatment of cisplatin combined with
IP10 neutralizing antibody significantly suppressed liver
tumor growth by promoting tumor necrosis and apoptosis
(Figure 6D). No obvious side effects related to IP10antibody were observed during the observation period.

DISCUSSION
IP10 plays a significant role in acute phase graft
injury and has potential value to predict tumor recurrence
after liver transplantation for liver cancer patients
[17]. Overexpression of IP10 also contributed to HCC
recurrence after liver transplantation through promoting
of tumor cell proliferation and invasion, together with
inducing angiogenesis by mobilization of circulating
endothelial progenitor cells [17, 18]. In the current
study, the acute phase up-regulation of IP10 was found
to have significant correlations with graft injury and
late phase tumor recurrent in HCC patients underwent
liver transplantation. We firstly demonstrated that graft
injury induced IP10 over-expression could promote
cisplatin resistance in HCC cells by activation of ATF6/
Grp78 ER stress signaling pathway. IP10 overexpression
could activate ATF6/Grp78 both in in vitro and in vivo
experiments, and further validated in our clinical cohort.

up-regulated by graft injury, such as GRP19, IL-6 and
HSP70 [17]. It will be worthwhile to investigate the
role of those graft injury related genes on the late phase
consequence after liver transplantation.
To date, more and more neoadjuvant therapies
including the neutralizing antibodies, were applied
as single or combined treatment for variety of cancer
diseases. As an example, VEGF antibody (Bevacizumab)
was found to have anti-tumor effect on colorectal
cancer and HCC [36, 37]. Moreover, Bevacizumab
was demonstrated to be an efficient adjuvant therapy to
sensitize chemotherapy and achieve better outcome in
advanced colorectal cancer and HCC [37, 38]. In this
study, we firstly demonstrated that IP10 neutralizing
antibody could be an efficient combination treatment
to sensitize cisplatin treatment both in vitro and in vivo.
It suggested the therapeutic potential of IP10 antibody
treatment for HCC patients. However, the effect of IP10
neutralizing antibody was only investigated on cisplatin
in current study. It will be worthwhile to further explore
the application of IP10 antibody on other chemodrugs
including 5-FU, doxorubicin and others. Additionally, by
thorough understanding of the interaction between IP10
and ER stress activation, the downstream targets such as
ATF6 and Grp78 will also have a potential value to be
further studied whether they could sensitize chemotherapy
and achieve a better outcome.
In conclusion, acute phase liver graft injury could
induce the overexpression of IP10 which responsible for
cisplatin resistance via ATF6/Grp78 ER stress signaling
pathway. IP10 neutralizing antibody could be a potential
adjuvant therapy to sensitize cisplatin treatment. It will
provide a new angle for attenuating early-phase graft
injury and the treatment of recurrent HCC patients.

used as normal liver control. Patients with tumor
recurrence were classified as tumor recurrent group.
Other patients without tumor recurrence were assigned
to non-recurrent group.

Animal models
Animals
Male inbred Buffalo rat weights from 280 ~ 350
g were applied as donors and recipients for rat liver
transplantation model. Male nude mice around 4~8
weeks old and weights from 20 ~ 25 g were applied for
orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft nude mice models.
These buffalo rat and nude mice were housed in a standard
laboratory environment with sufficient water, chow and
free activity. They were kept under constant environment
with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. They were fasted 12 hours
before operation. All the operations were performed under
sterilized condition. All the animal studies were approved
by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching
and Research (CULATR), The University of Hong Kong.
Rat liver transplantation model
The procedure for the donor operation was described
in our previous study [18].
Xenograft ectopic nude mice liver cancer model
Xenograft subcutaneous nude mice model was
established to study the role of IP10 on induction of
cisplatin resistance. Method was described in previous
study [39]. All the mice were segregated randomly and
six mice were recruited in each group.
Xenograft orthotopic nude mice liver cancer model
In order to study the effect of IP10 neutralizing
antibody, an orthotopic nude mice model was established
to compare the effect of cisplatin treatment alone and IP10
neutralizing antibody combined treatment (Supplementary
Figure S1). All the mice were segregated randomly and six
mice were recruited in each group.
Orthotopic nude mice liver cancer model with
MHCC97L-3.1, MHCC97L-IP10 or MHCC97L-luc cell
was established to observe the tumor growth under regular
cisplatin treatment. Briefly, approximately 1 × 107 cells in
0.2 ml of a culture medium were injected subcutaneously
into the right flank of Balb/c nude mice. The mice were
observed daily for signs of tumor development. Once
the subcutaneous tumor had reached 1 cm in diameter,
it was removed and cut into 1–2-mm cubes, which
were then implanted into the left lobe of another group
of nude mice (4 weeks old) [25]. Cisplatin or cisplatin
with IP10 antibody treatment started at 2 weeks after
the implantation. All the nude mice were segregated
randomly. Four milligrams per kilogram cisplatin with/
without 0.5 milligrams per kilogram IP10 antibody was
injected intraperitoneally into the nude mice every 4 days

Fifty HCC patients (30 patients within and 20
patients beyond Milan criteria; 36 patients within and
14 patients beyond UCSF criteria) who have undergone
liver transplantation between May 2001 and April 2009
were recruited with informed consent from Department
of Surgery, Queen Marry Hospital, The University of
Hong Kong. Among them, 20 HCC patients had tumor
recurrence after liver transplantation. Plasma samples
were collected one day before the liver transplantation
and 1 day, 7 days after liver transplantation. All
these plasmid were stored at −80°C. Forty-eight liver
samples were collected at 2 hours after portal vein
reperfusion during surgery. Four donor samples were

and lasted for 4 weeks. Finally, the mice were anesthetized
by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Abbott
Laboratories Chicago, IL, USA) at a dose of 50 mg/kg.
The volume of the tumors was measured and calculated
(Volume = 1/2 × Length × Width2). The liver and tumor
samples were collected and preserved in formalin and
liquid nitrogen.
In order to simulate graft injury induced
IP10 overexpression and its effect on developing
chemoresistance in HCC, an orthotopic nude mice liver
cancer model with hepatic IR injury was established.
Nude mice liver cancer model with hepatic IR
injury (IR injury group) was established by using
MHCC97L-luciferase HCC cell line, the luciferin
signal was examined by the Xenogen IVIS® in vivo
imaging system [25]. For the I/R injury group, the
portal vein was clamped for 30 minutes to mimic the
ischemia period during liver transplantation. After the
30 minutes ischemia, the tumor nodule with positive
luciferin signal was implanted into the left lobe of liver.
It has been demonstrated that the liver injury could
not be obviously detected if the ischemia period was
less than 30 minutes in our preliminary experiment.
Generally speaking, 45 minutes could be applied for
establishment of partial ischemia model [40]. However,
the mice could not tolerate the surgical treatment if the
ischemia period is too long in this study. Therefore,
we selected 30 minutes as ischemia period. Cisplatin
treatment started 2 weeks after the implantation.
Tumor size was compared at 3 weeks and 4 weeks
after cisplatin treatment by the Xenogen IVIS® in vivo
imaging system. After 4 weeks treatment, the mice were
sacrificed and tumor samples were collected for further
analysis.

4 weeks and expression of target gene was confirmed
using qRT-PCR and Western-blot.
3-(4,5-Dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay
In order to explore the proliferation rate of HCC
cells, MTT and colony formation assay were performed
as previously described [39].
Colony formation assay
Colony formation assay was performed to compare
the colony forming ability between different cell lines
or with different types of drug administrations. Culture
medium was changed every 3 days. After 2-week
incubation, the colonies were washed with 1X PBS and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS. They were then
stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 10 minutes at room
temperature. The colonies were counted under a light
microscope. The mean number of colonies was obtained
from three independent experiments.
The function of rIP10 in HCC cell lines
Colony formation assay was performed to
investigate whether the overexpression of IP10 in HCC
cell lines could promote cell proliferation under the
cisplatin environment. IP10 recombinant protein was
applied to study the extracellular function of IP10 in HCC
cell lines including Hep3B, Huh7, PLC and MHCC97L.
Cells (5 × 103cells/well) were seeded onto 6-well plates
and incubated with different concentrations of cisplatin
for 2 weeks. For the treatment group, 0.5 μg/ml IP10
recombinant protein was added into each well.

Cell culture

To investigate the intracellular function of IP10,
IP10 overexpressed stable transfectants, PLC-IP10 and
MHCC97L-IP10 were employed in colony formation
assay.

Human liver cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B and
Huh7) and human liver cell lines (MIHA and LO2) were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). The metastatic human liver cancer
cell line MHCC97L was a gift which given from the
Liver Cancer institute and Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan
University, Shanghai, the People’s Republic of China. All
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium
(DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 units/ml of penicilium and streptomycin (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

To investigate the function of IP10 neutralizing
antibody, MHCC97L-3.1 and PLC-3.1 with cisplatin
administration alone were applied as the control groups.
Meanwhile, MHCC97L-IP10 and PLC-IP10 with single
cisplatin administration were also applied. MHCC97LIP10 and PLC-IP10 with cisplatin and IP10 neutralizing
antibody were considered as the combination treatment
groups. The concentration of IP10 antibody for in vitro
study is 0.5 μg/mL. The concentration of IP10 antibody
was applied according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

performed as previously study described [39]. The stable
clone of MHCC97L-IP10 was selected using G418 at
0.4 mg/mL and the stable clone of PLC-IP10 was selected
using G418 at 0.6 mg/mL. The selection period was

The mRNA level of IP10 was determined by qRTPCR as previously described [17]. The internal control was
18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA). The sequences of primers
used were listed in Supplementary Table S1, S2 and S3.
