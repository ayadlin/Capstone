ABSTRACT
Purpose: In the battle against cancer discovery of new and novel
chemotherapeutic agent demands extreme obligation. Development of anticancer
compounds with higher potency and reduced side-effects is timely and challenging.
Experimental Design: A small series of fourteen diastereomeric β-lactams (seven
pairs) were synthesized through multi-step process exploring [2+2] ketene-imine
cycloaddition as the key step. Comparative stereochemical preferences were studied
through computational docking and validated by in vitro evaluation. β-tubulin was
considered as possible molecular target and in vitro anticancer evaluation was
conducted against SiHa, B16F10, K562 and Chang cell lines. Caspase-3 activation
assay and hematoxylin/eosin staining of the cells were also accomplished.
Results: Better docking scores of the cis- over the trans-β-lactams indicated
favorable β-lactam—β-tubulin interactions in cis-geometry. In vitro (IC50) evaluation
confirmed better anticancer activity of the cis-diastereoisomers. Apoptosis-induced
cell death was supported by caspase-3 activation study. A cis-β-lactam [(±)-Cis3-amino-1-phenyl-4-(p-tolyl) azetidin-2-one, 6C] was found to be more active
(in vitro) than the marketed natural drug colchicine against SiHa and B16F10 (six
times higher potency) cell lines. Reduced toxicity (compared to colchicine) in Chang
cells confirmed better site-selectivity (accordingly less side-effects) of 6C than
colchicine. Aside from 6C, most of the reported molecules demonstrated good to
strong in vitro anticancer activity against SiHa and B16F10 cancer cell lines.
Conclusions: Stereochemical preferences of the cis-β-lactams over their transcounterparts, toward the molecular target β-tubulin, was confirmed by docking
studies and in vitro anticancer evaluation. Apoptosis was identified as the cause of
cell death. The lead 6C exhibited higher potency and selectivity than the marketed
drug colchicine both in silico as well as in vitro.

worse enemies of modern civilization. While radiotherapy,
immunotherapy and surgical treatment play significant
role in the battle against cancer but chemotherapy, either
by own or in combination with other therapies, is still the
most widely used strategy for the treatment of cancer.
Moreover, several types of cancer have been developed
drug resistance for which no effective drugs are available
in the market [2, 3]. Therefore, it is important to develop
new and selective anticancer drugs with higher potency
and reduced side effects.
Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, the
four-membered cyclic amide (frequently known as
2-azetidinone or β-lactam) possesses the central position
in drug discovery research, in particular, to treat a wide
range of microbial infection. Notably, the β-lactam
pharmacophore is present in a huge number of molecules
(both natural and synthetic) that dominate worldwide the
market of antibiotics [4–6]. In contrary, many compounds
(natural, synthetic or semi-synthetic) are being used in
cancer chemotherapy but the use of β-lactam derivatives in
cancer chemotherapy is still unknown. This might be due
to the reason that the research on β-lactam as anticancer
agents is comparatively new and not been broadly
explored. In fact, the anticancer activity of diversely
substituted trans-β-lactams have been reported [7–15] to
some extent and after careful search of available literatures
we did not find a single example targeted to comparative
computational and biological studies of anticancer
potential of cis- and trans-β-lactams. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report that systematically
correlates the diastereoselectivity (cis- and trans-) of
β-lactams with anticancer activity.

for the diastereomeric synthesis of diversely substituted
3-phthalimido β-lactams. In the subsequent step, the
deprotection of the primary amine was carried out by
converting the 3-phthalimido β-lactams to 3-aminoazetidin-2-ones with ethylene diamine in dry ethanol
(Scheme 1).
A total of 14 β-lactam derivatives (seven pairs of
diastereomers) have been synthesized (Supplementary
Table 1) through multi-step process (Scheme 1) exploring
[2+2] ketene-imine cycloaddition as the key step. Although
the compounds were synthesized through multi-step process
and purified by repeated column chromatography yet good
to excellent yields were isolated each cases. The structure
and druglikeness of each molecule are shown in Table 1.
The structure of the 2-azetidinone derivatives were
elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses as follows:

β-tubulin. The drug-protein interaction of all the
fourteen 3-amino-azetidin-2-one derivatives (1C–7C and
1T–7T) was studied on the three available and known
binding sites (vinca, taxol and colchicine) of β-tubulin
[17]. Vinblastine, taxol (paclitaxel) and colchicine were
considered as the control molecules and the free energy
(Kcal/mol) for each compound was calculated (Table 1).
The docking interactions of (±)-Cis-3-amino-1phenyl-4-(p-tolyl)azetidin-one (6C) is shown in Figure 1.

Cytotoxic activity
The IC50 values of the fourteen 2-azetidinone
derivatives (seven pair of diastereomers) were calculated
from the concentrations of 10 to 0.312 µM for each
compound (triplicate) against SiHa (human cervical),
B16F10 (murine melanoma), K562 (human immortalized
myelogenous leukemia) and Chang cell lines. IC50 values
of the azetidin-2-ones are shown in Table 2.
The cytotoxic effect of the compound 6C in
SiHa and Chang cells has been studied (Figure 2). In a
Hematoxylin/Eosin staining sample where monolayers
of SiHa (a) and Chang (d) cells in the untreated control
groups (negative control) showed the characteristic
morphology of normal cell cultures, irregularly shaped,
well-defined junctions and nucleus-cytoplasm ratio
was preserved. In SiHa cells incubated with 1 µM of
the compound 6C (b) morphological alterations was
observed; mainly characterized by loss of cytoplasm
and decrease in the size of nuclei (arrows). Moreover,
in the incubated Chang cells, 1 µM concentration of the
compound 6C (e), the damage could be characterized by
the appearance of multiple intracytoplasmic vacuoles
(*). Treatment with taxol (20 mg/mL) induced severe

Molecular docking
By means of computational chemistry, a molecular
docking assay was performed targeting the protein

cell damage in SiHa cells (c), where nuclear membrane
pucker (creaser) (n), perinuclear vacuoles (pv), loss
of cytoplasm (arrows) and nuclear picnosis (p) were
observed. On the other hand, Chang cells (f) experienced
early apoptosis, was indicated by protrusions of the
cell membrane (membrane blebbing) (arrowhead),
cytoplasmic vacuoles (arrows) and sporadically large

perinuclear vacuoles (pv). The morphological studies
clearly demonstrated different susceptibility between
SiHa and Chang cells to the identical treatment as well as
different mechanism of cell damage for the investigative
compound as well as taxol in SiHa and Chang cell lines
although both the compounds (6C and taxol) ruptured the
cellular monolayer.

Alternatively, the trans diastereomers exhibited
moderate to poor (IC50: 4.79 to >10.00 in SiHa and 5.16 to
> 10.00 in B16F10 cell lines) anticancer activity against
the tested cancer cell lines as well as in Chang (normal
liver) cells (Table 2).

values of the protons H-3 and H-4 in the β-lactam ring
(J3,4 > 4.0 Hz represents a cis isomer whereas J3,4 < 3.0
Hz indicates trans stereoisomer) [18]. As a representative
example the 1H NMR spectra of the compounds (±)-trans3-amino-1,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-2-one (1T) and
(±)-cis-3-amino-1,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-2-one
(1C) could be considered (Figure 4). For the compound
(1T) the two protons H-3 and H-4 appeared at 3.96 ppm
(J = 1.7 Hz) and 4.57 ppm (J = 1.6 Hz) respectively whereas
in the compound (1C), the coupling constant values for both
the protons H-3 and H-4 are the same (J = 5.0 Hz). In fact,
the diastereoselectivity in β-lactam formation depends on
the generation of zwitterionic intermediate and the extent of
conrotatory cyclization (ring-closure) of the intermediate to
produce cis or trans β lactams [19, 20].
It is well-known that stereochemistry of a drug
molecule is greatly responsible for its pharmacological
activity. Accordingly, the stereoisomer that produces better

Apoptotic activity
The cis-diastereomer 6C demonstrated apoptosis
in B16F10 cancer cells through caspase-3 activation, was
determined by choosing podophyllotoxin (a γ-lactone
bearing pyrogallol derivative) as positive control (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
It is always challenging to control the
diastereoselectivity in β-lactam synthesis. The cis and trans
diastereomers can be identified by the coupling constant

B16F10 cancer cell lines. Interestingly, two cis-compounds
3C and 7C showed good in vitro anticancer activity (IC50 =
5–10 µM) against K562 cancer cell lines. All the fourteen
compounds are less toxic (more selective) than the positive
control colchicine, a well-known cancer chemotherapeutic
agent. In Chang cells 6C showed 10 times lesser toxicity in
comparison to the drug colchicine (Table 2).

therapeutic activity is known as eutomer and the less potent
(sometimes inactive or even toxic) stereoisomer is known
as distomer. The drugability of the newly synthesized
terminal β-lactams (1C–1T and 1T–7T) has been validated
by modified ‘Rule of 5’ (RO5) in Supplementary Table 1.
It was found that all the fourteen newly synthesized β-lactams
possess durglikeness and consequently can be termed as
possible ‘hits’. The in vitro anticancer evaluation has been
carried out against SiHa (human cervical carcinoma),
B16F10 (murine melanoma), K562 (human immortalized
myelogenous leukemia) and Chang cell lines. It has also
been confirmed that the mechanism of anticancer activity was
apoptosis-induced cell death. Finally, through a molecular
docking analysis, a better and clearer understanding of the
plausible β-lactam–β-tubulin interaction was explained,
considering the protein β-tubulin as the therapeutic target.
The free energy coupling values for the cis and trans
β-lactams on the proposed target β-tubulin do not match
with that of two widely used natural anticancer drugs
taxol and vincristine rather the values match with that of
another anticancer alkaloid colchicine. This indicates that
the binding sites of the β-lactams and colchicine are similar
in nature. Accordingly, the detail mechanism of action of
the β-lactams might be similar to that of colchicine. The
docking score of the compound 6C is better than the natural
drug colchicine (-7.6 compared to -7.4 for colchicine, Table
1) supports better anticancer activity of this compound than
colchicine which has been confirmed by in vitro anticancer
evaluation (Table 2). The IC50 values of the compound 6C
are better than colchicine against SiHa and B16F10 cancer
cell lines. In fact, the drug-protein interactions depend on the
chemical nature and three dimensional spatial orientation of
the drug molecule and the subsequent interactions with the
amino acid residues on the binding sites in β-tubulin. The
molecular interactions of the compound 6C with β-tubulin
showed bonding interactions with the Cys 239, Lys 252, Val
323, Met 257, Lys 350, Leu 246 and Ala 248 amino acid
residues (Figure 1). Based on the accumulated data a strong
interaction between the β-lactam pharmacophore and the
aminoacid residues of the β-tubulin can be proposed.
Interestingly, the compound 6C showed strong
in vitro anticancer activity (IC50 = 0.7 µM) in murine
melanoma (B16F10) cell lines and IC50 = 2.34 µM in
human cervical carcinoma SiHa cell lines and qualified
as the lead with considerable anticancer activity in
comparison to colchicine. The trans-β-lactams 1T, 2T,
4T, 5T, and the cis-β-lactams 2C, 3C, 4C and 7C showed
good in vitro anticancer activity (IC50 = 5 – 10 µM) against
SiHa cancer cell lines whereas the β-lactams 1T, 2T, 5T
and 4C demonstrated good in vitro anticancer activity
(IC50 = 5 –10 µM) against B16F10 cancer cell lines. On
the other hand, two compounds 2C and 3C showed strong
in vitro anticancer activity (IC50 < 5 µM) against B16F10
cancer cell lines. Besides the lead compound 6C, two
other compounds 1C and 5C demonstrated strong in vitro
anticancer activity (IC50 = 5–10 µM) against SiHa and

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemistry
Melting points were determined in a Fisher
Scientific electrochemical Mel-Temp* manual melting
point apparatus (Model 1001) equipped with a 300ºC
thermometer. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Alpha modular Platinum-ATR FT-IR spectrometer with
OPUS software, using the samples directly (neat) without
making pallets. 1H NMR (600 MHz) and 13C NMR
(150 MHz) spectra were obtained at room temperature
with Bruker superconducting Ultrashield Plus 600
MHz NMR spectrometer with central field 14.09 T,
coil inductance 89.1 H, and magnetic energy 1127.2 kJ
using CDCl3 as solvent. All the solvents were purchased
from Fisher-Scientific throughout the investigation.
Dichloromethane and triethylamine were dried following
the standard procedures. Deionized water was used for the
preparation of all aqueous solutions.

General procedure for the synthesis of imines
Amine and aldehyde were mixed in equimolar (1:1)
ratio and refluxed in dry toluene using a Dean-Stark water
separator. After completion of the reaction (monitored by
thin layer chromatography, 2–3 hours), the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure distillation (by rotavapor)
and the pure imine was isolated by crystallization from
dichloromethane/hexanes.

General procedure for the synthesis of
3-phthalimido β-lactams via the Staudinger
reaction
A representative experimental procedure is
described as follows: A solution of phthalimidoacetic
acid (N-phthaloylglycine) (1.5 mmol) in anhydrous
dichloromethane (10 mL) was added (dropwise during
30 minutes) to another solution consisted of 2-chloro-1methylpyridinium iodide (Mukaiyama reagent, 3 mmol)
and triethylamine (6 mmol) in 10 mL dry dichloromethane
at 0 to (–5)°C temperature under inert (argon) atmosphere.
This mixture was stirred for 2 hours maintaining the same
temperature. Imine (1 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (10
mL) was then added to this mixture at the same temperature.
The reaction mixture was then stirred overnight at room
temperature and monitored by thin layer chromatography

(TLC). After completion of the reaction, the reaction
mixture was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate
solution (10 mL), brine (10 mL) and deionized water
successively. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous
sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to obtain the crude
product. Column chromatography over silica gel was
performed using ethyl acetate/hexanes mixtures to isolate
the cis- and trans-3-phthalimido β-lactams in pure form.
The cis:trans ratio was approximately 2:1 in all the cases.

1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were trypsinized and
seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/mL in a 96-well plate
and incubated at 37 °C, 95% O2/5% CO2 atmosphere for
24 h. Thereafter the cells were treated with azetidin-2-one
derivatives (dissolved in DMSO) at various concentrations
between 312 nM–10 µM, and re-incubated for further 72 h.
Wells containing the equal volume of the vehicle DMSO
(1% v/v) were used as background (negative control). The
culture medium was then removed and the cells washed
with 100 µL phosphate buffered saline (PBS); then 10 µL
WST-1 (Roche, USA) was added. Cells were incubated for
2 h in absence of light at 37°C, and absorbance was read
subsequently [23]. The absorbance value of cells without
added compound was set to 100% cell viability and was
compared versus cell death density (cells treated with
Triton ×100) and also natural anticancer drug colchicine as
positive control compound. Afterwards, these values were
used to assess half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
using Graph-Pad Prism software.

General procedure for the synthesis of 3-amino
β-lactams from 3-phthalimido β-lactam
Ethylenediamine (2 mmol) was added to a solution
of diastereomerically pure 3-phthalimido β-lactam
(1 mmol) in anhydrous ethyl alcohol (5 mL) under argon
atmosphere. This mixture was stirred at room temperature
and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC.
After completion of the reaction (15 min–1 h) the ethanol
was removed by reduced pressure distillation and the crude
mass was extracted with ethyl acetate (25 mL). The ethyl
acetate layer was washed with brine and water successively
(10 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The pure
products were obtained via column chromatography over
silica gel using ethyl acetate/hexanes as the eluent.

Hematoxylin/Eosin staining of the cells
Cells (10 × 104) were grown on coated poly-lysine
coverslips which were placed in 6-well microplates
overnight and then incubated for 24 h in the presence
of compound 6C or taxol, subsequently stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. Coverslips were then observed by
Light microscopy of bright field (40X).

Molecular docking
One of the major cancer related proteins, β-tubulin,
was considered as the theoretical target to perform docking
studies of the azetidin-2-ones (β-lactams) as possible
antiproliferative compounds. The hydrogens and charges
on receptor and ligand were assigned with the Chimera
program [21]. The pdbqt files for docking simulations
were generated using the AutoDock Tools interface. The
docking of azetidine-2-one derivatives on β-tubulin was
performed with Autodock 4.2 program [22]. The grid sizes
in each dimension (x, y, and z) were 60 Å, grid points
separated by 0.375 Å, with its center in 116, 89 and 6
for x, y and z, respectively. The analysis of AutoDock
predicted molecular interactions was conducted by
AutoDock vina interface and Chimera program. Maestro
software showed the key amino acids from colchicine
binding site of β-tubulin.

Apoptotic activity
The mechanism of cell death was identified as
apoptosis. It was validated with the compound 6C.
Enzyme activity associated with the induction of
apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 assay (Invitrogen,
USA) as described in the protocol [24]. A concentration
of approximately 3 × 106 cells/mL (B16F10) was taken
and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 environment.
Podophyllotoxin (apoptosis inducing agent) was used
as positive control. After incubation for 24 h the cells
were re-suspended and 50 µL of cell lysis reagent was
added, then cells were incubated for 10 min in ice bath
and centrifuged. The supernatant (cytosol extract) was
transferred into a new effendrof. Cytosol extract was
diluted with cell lysis reagent to a concentration of
2 µg/µL, in a total volume of 50 µL. Then 50 µL of 2X
reaction buffer and 5 µL of tetrapeptide-p-nitroaniline
(DEVD-pNA) were added. It was incubated at 37 °C for
2 h (in dark), and finally the optical density at 405 nm was
measured with an ELISA Reader [24]. Caspase-3 activity
was calculated that confirmed apoptosis as the mechanism
of cell death. With this data and the value of caspasae-3
induction by the podophyllotoxin, it was possible to
calculate the ratio of apoptosis with respect to the positive
control on murine melanoma cancer cells (B16F10).

Biology
Cytotoxic activity
In vitro anticancer assays were performed in
triplicate for the determination of mean values. The human
cervical carcinoma SiHa, murine melanoma B16F10,
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562, and Chang
cell lines were cultured in minimum essential medium
of Eagle at 37 °C in a 95% O2/5% CO2 atmosphere
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and

In conclusion, a series of fourteen (seven pairs
of cis- and trans-diastereomers) diversely substituted
diastereomeric β-lactam derivatives have been
successfully synthesized. In vitro anticancer evaluation
showed that one of these newly synthesized cis-β-lactam
derivatives (6C) possesses higher potency in human
cervical carcinoma SiHa cell lines, six times higher
potency in murine melanoma B16F10 cell lines and
10 times less toxicity in normal liver Chang cell lines
compared to the positive control colchicine, a well-known
anticancer alkaloid. Besides the cis-β-lactam 6C, most
of the newly synthesized β-lactams (both diastereomers)
exhibited moderate to strong anticancer activity against
SiHa and B16F10 cancer cell lines. The binding sites of
the compound on β-tubulin was found to be similar with
that of colchicine and apoptotic cell death through caspase
activation was found as the mechanism of action. It was
supported by the microscopic observation. Molecular
coupling of the compound 6C on β-tubulin colchicine site,
exhibited binding interactions with the Cys 239, Lys 252,
Val 323, Met 257, Lys 350, Leu 246 y Ala 248 amionacid
residues by molecular docking assay. The molecule 6C
may find its application in anticancer drug discovery
process.
