ABSTRACT
Viruses have evolved various strategies to escape from the innate cellular
mechanisms inhibiting viral replication and spread. Extensive evidence has highlighted
the ineffectiveness of interferon (IFN) therapy against chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection, implying the existence of mechanisms by which HBV evades IFN-induced
antiviral responses. In our current study, we demonstrate that HBV surface protein
(HBs) plays a crucial role in counteracting the IFN-induced antiviral response mediated
by tetherin (also known as BST-2). The type I IFN treatment of HBV-producing cells
marginally but significantly inhibited the release of HBsAg and viral DNA, but this release
was recovered by the knockdown of tetherin. HBs can interact with tetherin via its fourth
transmembrane domain thereby inhibiting its dimerization and antiviral activity. The
expression of a tetherin mutant devoid of the HBs-binding domain promoted a prominent
restriction of HBV particle production that eventually resulted in the alleviation of
caspase-1-mediated cytotoxicity and interleukin-1β secretion in induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocytes. Our current results thus reveal a previously undescribed
molecular link between HBV and tetherin during the course of an IFN-induced antiviral
response. In addition, strategies to augment the antiviral activity of tetherin by impeding
tetherin-HBs interactions may be viable as a therapeutic intervention against HBV.

treatment goal for patients with hepatitis B is to prevent
progression of the disease to cirrhosis, liver failure, or
hepatocellular carcinoma. Current antiviral therapies for
HBV infection involve nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NRTIs). However, the long-term treatment of
hepatitis B with NRTIs can be associated with toxicity
and the emergence of drug resistant viral mutations,
which result in treatment failure and disease progression.
Therefore, it is vital to develop a new type of antiviral
drugs for hepatitis B treatment. Pegylated IFNα is also the
standard first-line agent in the treatment of hepatitis B. The
biological response to IFN is mediated by its binding to
the IFN receptors and the activation of the Janus-activated
kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription

INTRODUCTION
The type I interferon (IFN) system, which includes
IFNα and IFNβ, is an innate immune response [1]. Upon
virus infection, cells can readily secrete IFNα/β as part of
the biological defense mechanisms that plays a primary
role in virus restriction. Indeed, IFNα/β induces the
synthesis of a range of antiviral proteins, which serve as
cell-autonomous intrinsic restriction factors [2]. However,
viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade the IFN
system, which would otherwise limit viral spread at an
early stage of infection [3].
Hepatitis B is a serious infectious illness of the liver
caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) [4]. The primary

(STAT) pathway. This leads to the expression of several
hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as tetherin
(also known as BST-2).
Tetherin inhibits the release of HIV, Ebola, Lassa,
herpes and other enveloped viruses from infected cells by
tethering progeny virions to the membranes of the host
cells [5]. However, many viral proteins can inactivate
tetherin in multiple ways [6]. For example, HIV-1 Vpu
can displace tetherin from the site of viral assembly in
the plasma membrane [7, 8]. Ebola virus glycoprotein
(GP) can bind tetherin directly for antagonizing its
function, although the mechanism was not deciphered [9].
Furthermore, tetherin can induce NF-κB-mediated signal
transduction, leading to the production of proinflammatory
cytokines, thereby acting as an innate sensor of viral
release [10–12].
Accumulating evidence now strongly indicates that
IFNα may not be an effective treatment for hepatitis B
virus infection [13]. These findings suggest that HBV
has evolved strategies to block IFN signal transduction
and its antiviral properties. Previous reports indicate
that HBV polymerase can block STAT activation to limit
IFNα–induced antiviral responses [14, 15]. Although the
aforementioned pathway might be associated with a high
incidence of resistance to type I IFN in patients with HBV
infection, it remains elusive as to whether there are other
mechanisms that contribute to the IFN-resistance of HBV
in connection with ISGs. Thus, it is likely that HBV has
the countermeasures to repress the innate antiviral function
of tetherin.
In our present study, we reveal that IFN-induced
tetherin can repress the release of HBV from infected
cells but is antagonized by the viral protein HBs. We also
suggest that the transduction of HBs-resistant tetherin in
hepatocytes may be a potential option in the treatment of
HBV infection.

the levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and vDNA in
the culture supernatant (Figure 1D, 1E). Moreover, these
IFN-induced effects were reduced by a knockdown of
tetherin by siRNA (Figure 1D, 1E). These results indicate
that IFN-induced tetherin acts as an antiviral effector
against HBV release, although in a relatively weak
manner.

HBs binds tetherin via its fourth transmembrane
domain
Hepatocytes have been reported to remain permissive
for HBV infection regardless of the treatment of IFNα
[16]. This is indicative of antagonistic properties of HBV
against endogenous tetherin. To delineate this hypothesis,
we assessed whether HBV-encoding proteins could interact
with and inactivate tetherin. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that both large and small HBs (LHBs and SHBs)
can interact with tetherin, but that no other viral protein
(such as HBc, HBx and polymerase) could do so (Figure
2A). To verify the association between SHBs and tetherin
in cells, we next examined the intracellular localization
of both proteins by immunofluorescence confocal
microscopy. Our results indicated that these proteins colocalize in the perinuclear region and cytoplasm (Figure
2B). We next attempted to identify the domain within
SHBs that is responsible for the interaction with tetherin.
Since SHBs has four transmembrane regions, we generated
deletion mutants of these regions. Immunoprecipitation
analysis with these SHB mutants indicated that the most
C-terminal transmembrane domain (TM4) of SHBs is
important for the binding of tetherin, since SHBs lacking
TM4 (SHBs∆TM4) were not co-immunoprecipitated with
tetherin (Figure 2C). Moreover, in vitro pull-down analysis
using recombinant HBs (genotype A, B, C and D) and
tetherin proteins synthesized in cell-free protein systems
[17], clearly demonstrated that their interactions are
evolutionally conserved across all of the HBV genotypes
tested (Figure 2D).

RESULTS
Type I IFN-induced tetherin marginally
represses HBV release

HBs inhibits the dimerization of tetherin to
counteract its antiviral activity

Since tetherin is one of many ISGs, we first
investigated whether IFNα/β could induce the expression
of tetherin in human hepatocytes. Whilst we found a
relatively low level expression of tetherin in untreated
cells, treatment with type I IFNs increased the tetherin
protein to the certain levels in HepG2 cells and primary
human hepatocytes (Figure 1A). We then investigated the
antiviral response by tetherin induced by IFNα treatment.
HepG2 cells were treated with or without tetherinspecific siRNAs and IFNα, and then transfected with a
HBV molecular clone (pUC19-C_JPNAT; genotype C)
(Figure 1B). Although IFNα did not affect the amounts
of intracellular viral DNA (vDNA) (Figure 1C), we found
that IFNα weakly but statistically significantly decreased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We next evaluated the antagonizing effect of HBs
on the function of tetherin using a HIV-1 viral-like particle
(VLP) model. In this model, HepG2 cells are cotransfected
with vectors encoding HIV-1 Gag-Pol and tetherin
together with either HBs (LHBs, SHBs and SHBs∆TM4)
or HIV-1 Vpu (tetherin antagonist of HIV-1) as a positive
control. As reported previously, the expression of
tetherin restricted HIV-1 VLP release by approximately
10-fold in our ELISA experiments. This restriction was
recovered by expression of LHBs and SHBs as well as
Vpu. However, the SHBs mutant lacking tetherin binding
site (SHBs∆TM4) failed to recover VLP release (Figure
3A). These results suggest that the direct interaction of

HBs with tetherin via TM4 domain might be essential for
the anti-tetherin function of HBs. Although Vpu has been
reported to decrease the expression of tetherin in cells [18,
19], we did not observe this same effect in case of HBs
(Figure 3A).
Since HBs was found to interact directly with
tetherin (Figure 2D), we hypothesized that it might
interfere with the dimer formation of tetherin. As
previously reported [20, 21], wild-type (WT) tetherin
is detectable as a dimer (50 kD) under non-reducing
conditions (Figure 3B). Interestingly, we found in our
current experiments that HBs, but not HBs∆TM4,
increased the monomeric tetherin level (Figure 3B),
suggesting that HBs counteracts the antiviral activity
of tetherin by inhibiting dimerization. Consistently, the
overexpression of a dimerization-defect tetherin mutant
(C53, 63, 91A) [20] had no effects on HBV release (Figure
3C, 3D). Collectively, these results suggest that HBs can
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bind and antagonize tetherin by inhibiting the functional
dimerization of tetherin (Figure 3E).

The transmembrane domain of tetherin is
responsible for HBs binding
We next mapped the binding domain within tetherin
that interacts with HBs. Tetherin consists of an N-terminal
cytoplasmic (CT) domain, single transmembrane (TM)
domain, extracellular (EC) domain and a C-terminal
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Figure 4A).
Tetherin mutants lacking these domains were generated
and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. All
of these tetherin mutants except for ∆TM efficiently
interacted with HBs (Figure 4A), indicating that the
tetherin transmembrane domain is responsible for the
HBs binding. To further confirm the possibility that
HBs antagonizes tetherin through TM-TM associations,

infected with HBV for 10 days and the virus levels in the
culture supernatants were then measured. Interestingly, HBV
particle release from HepG2-Tet-NTCP cells was found to
be comparable to that from those additionally expressing
WT tetherin (Figure 5E), suggesting that WT tetherin failed
to inhibit HBV release due to a HBs-mediated counteracting
mechanism. In contrast, HepG2-Tet-NTCP cells expressing
TFRTM tetherin demonstrated significantly reduced levels of
progeny virions in the culture supernatant (Figure 5E). These
results suggested that even at lower levels, TFRTM tetherin
can effectively restrict HBV release.

We next examined the effect of HBs-resistant tetherin
on HBV release. Consistent with the data from our HIV-1
VLP assay (Figure 4C), TFRTM tetherin exhibited more
potency for inhibiting HBV release and was effective even
at relatively lower amounts (i.e, 62 ng/well) (Figure 5A, 5B).
Recent studies have demonstrated that the stable expression
of NTCP (Na+ taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide) in
HepG2 cells allows for HBV entry, viral protein synthesis,
and subsequent production of progeny virions [23–25].
We thus generated HepG2 cells harboring a tetracyclineinducible NTCP gene, referred to hereafter as HepG2-TetNTCP. We also produced HepG2-Tet-NTCP cells that stably
expressed tetherin at a lower level (Figure 5C). We confirmed
that these cell lines expressed an equivalent level of NTCP in
the presence of doxycycline (Figure 5D). These cells were

would have potential benefits. The recent development
of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology
enabled us to utilize iPSC-derived hepatocytes in liver
diseases including virus-induced hepatitis. We thus
cotransfected human iPSC-derived hepatocytes with
either WT or TFRTM tetherin and a HBV molecular
clone to assess the inhibitory effect of TFRTM tetherin
on HBV release (Figure 6A). Compared with WT
tetherin, TFRTM tetherin strongly inhibited the release
of HBV (Figure 6B). Although the aberrant expression

hepatocytes, this was completely reverted by TFRTM

induced cell death, possibly by apoptosis [26, 27].

hepatocytes (data not shown) but instead detected the

DISCUSSION

of cytosolic contents, including lactose dehydrogenase
(LDH) [29]. Indeed, we detected LDH secretion (Figure
6G) and the formation of membrane rupture in HBVtransduced hepatocytes (Figure 6H). Notably, TFRTM
tetherin decreased the levels of these pyroptosis markers
(Figure 6E, 6F, 6G). Taken together, our current data
provide the proof of concept that the use of TFRTM
tetherin is a viable strategy for cell-mediated anti-HBV
therapy in the context of inhibiting viral release and virusinduced cytopathic effects.

In our current study, we decipher the molecular
link between HBV and tetherin during the course of HBV
infection as part of an IFN-induced antiviral response. We
find that tetherin can block HBV release, but the HBV
surface protein, HBs, can antagonize the antiviral activity
of tetherin. This scenario strongly supports the “offensive
and defensive battle” theory between host and virus [30],
in which both players can be reciprocally suppressed in
21847

Oncotarget

accordance with the quantity and/or capability ratio of
tetherin versus HBs. When HBs is more predominant
than tetherin (e.g. during the acute infection phase), HBs
can inactivate the antiviral function of tetherin via direct
interaction through the TM4 domain. Conversely, if
tetherin predominates, it can restrict the release of HBV.
Indeed, many viral proteins can inactivate tetherin in
multiple ways [6]. For example, Ebola virus Glycoprotein
(GP) counteracts tetherin without inducing its degradation.
Although the mechanism of this is not known, GP needs
to bind tetherin directly to antagonize its function [9].
We found in our current study that HBs can inhibit the
dimerization of tetherin, which is an essential process
for anti-HBV activity. This is the first evidence of a
mechanistic link between HBs and tetherin. Additionally,
a recent study has indicated that in plasmacytoid dendritic
cells, HBs abrogates the TLR7/9-induced innate immune
reaction towards IFNα gene transcription [31], suggesting
that as an upstream effector, HBs may downregulate the
expression of ISGs itself in vivo.
The role of intracellular restriction factors in HBV
infection as a part of the type I IFN pathway has not been
well studied. Several ISGs, including APOBEC3G and
IDO, have been shown to act as putative anti-HBV factors
in in vitro culture models [32, 33]. However, for unknown
reasons, the response rate of IFNα-treated hepatitis B
patients was found previously to be very poor regardless of
the induction of ISGs [34]. This discrepancy between in vitro
and in vivo effects may be partly due to the stoichiometric
balance between ISGs and its viral countermeasure (such
as tetherin and HBs). Indeed, our current study findings
demonstrated the effect of IFN-induced tetherin on viral
release to be relatively weak, but that an overabundance
of HBs-resistant chimeric tetherin strongly inhibited
HBV release in comparison with WT tetherin. Hence, the
development of new methods for transducing HBs-resistant
tetherin into hepatocytes could prove to be a unique strategy
to efficiently suppress HBV replication. In this regard,
our current study has demonstrated that the transduction
of HBs-resistant tetherin into iPSC-derived hepatocytes
confers potent anti-HBV activity and protects the cells from
HBV-induced cytotoxicity. This therapeutic strategy would
be more practicable by utilizing recently developed genome
editing and stem cell technologies.
In our current analyses, we unexpectedly found that
HBs-resistant tetherin strongly inhibited HBV-triggered
cell death, accompanied by caspase-1 activation and
IL-1β secretion. These are markers of “pyroptosis”—a
proinflammatory cell death process that eliminates the
infected cell [35]. During viral infection, viral DNA/RNA
recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in
host cells can promote the formation of inflammasomes,
resulting in the activation of caspase-1. This induces
pyroptosis together with the secretion of proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 [35]. Several previous reports
have demonstrated that AIM2, a cytosolic PRR, enhances
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

immunopathology during HBV infection [36, 37]. Tetherin
may block the AIM2-dependent signaling pathway via
unknown mechanisms. Alternatively, in the absence
of tetherin, vast quantities of virions (including Dane
particles, HBsAg or HBcAg subviral particles) released
from HBV-producing cells may trigger pyroptosis.
Indeed, HBcAg has been shown to induce the secretion
of bioactive IL-18, another marker of pyroptosis, an event
which is blocked by caspase-1 inhibitor [38]. Although
the mechanisms underlying how PRRs sense HBcAg are
not yet known, HBV-mediated pyroptosis can be activated
by HBcAg invasion. Nonetheless, blockage of HBVassociated hepatic injury may be a therapeutic strategy for
the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Further studies should
identify the involvement of inflammasome-mediated
hepatocyte death in HBV infection.
In conclusion, tetherin plays an important role in
intracellular antiviral immunity during the course of HBV
infection. Strategies to augment the antiviral activity of
tetherin by impeding tetherin-HBs interactions may be a
viable therapeutic intervention against HBV. Moreover,
a better understanding of how HBV evades IFN-induced
host immune response during infection may help to
develop more effective vaccines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids
The HBV molecular clone pUC19-C_JPNAT
(genotype C) has been described previously [39]. Tetherin,
HIV-1 Gag-Pol and Vpu expression vectors have also
been described previously [40, 41]. The tetherin mutants,
∆CT (∆2–21 aa), ∆TM (∆22–44 aa), ∆EC (∆45–160 aa),
∆GPI (1–160 aa) and C53,63,91A, were generated using
PCR-based molecular cloning procedures. To generate
HBs-resistant tetherin mutants, the TM domain of tetherin
was replaced with the corresponding domain of human
transferrin receptor (63–88 aa). HBV LHBs, SHBs,
HBc, HBx and polymerase cDNAs were synthesized or
amplified from pUC19-C_JPNAT with the appropriate
primer pairs, followed by subcloning into the pCMV3xFLAG vector (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). The
HBs derivatives, ∆TM1 (∆180–201 aa), ∆TM2 (∆254–
273 aa), ∆TM3 (∆344–366 aa) and ∆TM4 (∆376–398
aa), were constructed using PCR-based mutagenesis.
For viral vector production, NTCP and tetherin cDNAs
were inserted into the packaging vector pRetroX-TRE3G
(Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and CSII-CMV-MCS-IRES2Bsd (RIKEN BRC, Ibaraki, Japan), respectively.

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM
HEPES and 5 μg/ml insulin. To generate HepG2-TetNTCP cells, the parental HepG2 Tet-On Advanced cells
(Clontech) were infected with a RetroX-based retroviral
vector encoding the NTCP gene, and selected with 1 μg/
ml puromycin. Derivatives of HepG2-Tet-NTCP cells
stably expressing tetherin were generated by transduction
with CSII-based lentiviral vectors expressing WT or
TFRTM tetherin, followed by selection in 10 μg/ml
blasticidin. Primary human hepatocytes were purchased
from Phoenixbio (Hiroshima, Japan). Human iPSCderived hepatocytes were generated by ReproCELL
(Kanagawa, Japan) according to a previously described
procedure [42]. Retroviral vectors were prepared from
293-GP2 cells (Clontech) in 6-cm dishes cotransfected
with the RetroX packaging vector (3 μg) and VSV-G
expression plasmids (1 μg) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. For the production of
lentiviral vectors, 293T cells in 6-cm dishes were
cotransfected with the CSII packaging vector (6 μg),
HIV-1 Gag-Pol (3.5 μg) and VSV-G expression plasmids
(3.5 μg). Culture supernatants containing viral vectors
were collected at 48 h after transfection, filtered through
a 0.45-µm filter (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA).

In the siRNA and IFNα experiments (Figure 1),
one day prior to the transfection of the HBV molecular
clone, cells were transduced with 60 pmol tetherin-specific
siRNA (HSS101113 and HSS101114, Life Technologies)
or control siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life
Technologies). Cells were then pre-treated with 1000 U/
ml IFNα (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h before transfection. At
24 h after transfection of pUC19-C_JPNAT (2.5 μg), cells
were washed twice and then additionally cultured for three
days with or without IFNα, followed by quantification of
HBsAg and vDNA, as described above.

HBV preparation and infection
HBV stocks were derived from the supernatants
of HepG2.2.15 cells, which were stably transfected with
a complete HBV genome (genotype D). The collected
supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-µm filter (Merck
Millipore), and concentrated using PEG virus precipitation
kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA). HepG2-Tet-NTCP or
its derivative cells in 24-well plates were infected with
HBV (5000 GEq/cell) with or without 5 μg/ml Dox. The
culture supernatants were then harvested and subjected to
quantification of HBsAg and vDNA, as described above.

Immunoprecipitation, in vitro pull-down and
immunoblotting

Transfection-based HBV release assays
HepG2 cells in 6-well plates were cotransfected
with pUC19-C_JPNAT (2.5 μg) and a tetherin
expression vector (62–250 ng) using GenJet in vitro
DNA transfection reagent (SignaGen, Rockville, MD) or
Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. At 3 days posttransfection, culture supernatants were cleared of cell
debris by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 3 min. The
HBsAg quantities in each sample were then measured
using a HBsAg ELISA kit (Alpha Diagnostic, San
Antonio, TX). Cells were suspended with lysis buffer
(100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2% NP-40) and clarified
by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. To remove
the plasmid-derived DNA, the cell lysates or culture
supernatants (250 μl) were were digested with 200 μg/
ml DNase I, 100 μg/ml RNase A and 6 mM MgOAc for
2 h at 37°C, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min.
The supernatants were then mixed with a solution of
10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl and 200 μg/ml
proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland),
and incubated at 55°C for 1 h. These samples were
extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with
ethanol and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA). Viral DNA was then
quantified by real-time PCR using SYBR Premix Ex
Taq II (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and a CFX-96 system
instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The primer pair
used was 5′-gagtgtggattcgcactcc-3′ (HBV2270F) and
5′-gaggcgagggagttcttct-3′ (HBV2392R) [23].

Immunoprecipitation were performed as previously
described [43, 44]. In vitro streptavidin pull-down analysis
with recombinant proteins were also performed as previously
described [43]. Briefly, biotinylated tetherin was incubated
with SHBs-FLAG at 26°C for 2 h before being co-incubated
with streptavidin-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, UK) at 4°C for 3 h. Bound proteins were analyzed
by immunoblotting as follows. Samples in SDS loading
buffer (with or without 2-mercaptoethanol) were loaded onto
10% or 15% gels and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Merck
Millipore). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies
and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(GE Healthcare). The antibodies used in this study were as
follows: anti-tetherin (a gift from Chugai Pharmaceuticals),
anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-HA (Roche), anti-FLAG
(Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA), anti-p24 (NIH AIDS Reagent Program),
anti-NTCP (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich)
and anti-caspase1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The proteins
detected were visualized on a FluorChem digital imaging
system (Alpha Innotech, San Leanardo, CA) and the band
intensities were quantified with NIH ImageJ software.

HIV-1 VLP release assays
HepG2 cells in 12-well plates were transfected
with vectors encoding HIV-1 Gag-Pol (200 ng), tetherin
(100 ng) and either HBs (200 or 1000 ng) or Vpu (100 or 500
ng). At four days after transfection, culture supernatants were

harvested and clarified, and p24 antigens were measured with
an HIV-1 p24 ELISA kit (Zepto Metrix, Buffalo, NY). For
immunoblotting analysis, the virus-containing supernatants
was layered onto 20% sucrose in PBS and centrifuged at
20,000 g for 2 h. Cell and virion lysates were then subjected
to immunoblotting analysis as described above.
