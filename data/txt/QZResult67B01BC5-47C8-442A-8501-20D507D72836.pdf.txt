Genetically Engineered Mouse Models: Closing the Gap
between Preclinical Data and Trial Outcomes
Mallika Singh, Christopher L. Murriel, and Leisa Johnson

Abstract
The high failure rate of late-stage human clinical trials, particularly in oncology, predicates the need for
improved translation of preclinical data from mouse tumor models into clinical predictions. Genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMM) may fulﬁll this need, because they mimic spontaneous and autochthonous
disease progression. Using oncogenic Kras-driven GEMMs of lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, we recently
showed that these models can closely phenocopy human therapeutic responses to standard-of-care treatment
regimens. Here we review the successful preclinical application of such GEMMs, as well as the potential for
discovering predictive biomarkers and gaining mechanistic insights into clinical outcomes and drug resistance in
human cancers. Cancer Res; 72(11); 2695–700. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction
The conventional oncology-drug–development process
involves the extensive use of preclinical mouse models to
gauge the efﬁcacy of new molecular entities (NME) in vivo.
Historically, these models have predominantly, if not exclusively, relied on xenograft systems using human cancer cell
lines and tumor explants in immune-deﬁcient mice (1, 2).
However, the results obtained with these surrogate model
systems over the past several years have inadequately predicted human clinical outcomes, particularly in the case of
targeted therapeutics (3, 4). Some notable exceptions to this
are tumors that are clearly dependent on cell-autonomous
pathway perturbations, such as mutations in epidermal growth
factor receptor [EGFR (5)] or Type I, ligand-independent
mutations in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (6). Nonetheless,
these systems imperfectly model the autochthonous tumor
microenvironment as well as the dynamic and evolutionary
interplay between different cell types within tumors (i.e.,
paracrine interactions). Therefore, it is critical to identify more
predictive and prognostic preclinical models of human malignancies to enable the development of new and effective cancer
therapies.
Possible reasons for the disparate therapeutic responses
observed in human tumors and mouse xenografts include the
fundamental differences between mice and humans (such as

drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, toxicities, and combination tolerability), the particular attributes selected for during
xenograft propagation, the incomplete nature of the xenograft
tumor microenvironment, or some combination thereof. Some
of these issues may be resolved through the use of genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMM) of cancer, which more
faithfully recapitulate many aspects of their corresponding
human disease (7, 8). Preclinical models that more accurately
phenocopy human disease (or subsets thereof) would enable
investigators to better test drug efﬁcacy and model mechanisms of action and therapeutic resistance. In addition, they
could aid in the identiﬁcation of optimal dosing regimens, both
alone and in combination with other agents. The latter is
particularly relevant because targeted NMEs are routinely
combined with standard-of-care chemotherapeutics and, in
recent clinical trials, with other NMEs.
Until recently, despite preclinical studies described in the
literature, it was unclear whether GEMMs could actually
predict human responses in the clinic better than xenografts,
or how they might be made to do so. Part of the problem is that
most of those preclinical studies did not adequately model the
human clinical scenario with ﬁdelity. Speciﬁcally, (i) the mutations they used did not always phenocopy the appropriate
physiological context (e.g., oncogenes that are overexpressed
from an artiﬁcial promoter); (ii) in the majority of cases, they
did not interrogate the most clinically relevant stages of
disease (i.e., late-stage and/or metastatic disease); (iii) they
failed to examine clinically relevant combinations of targeted
agents with standard-of-care chemotherapeutics, particularly
for front-line disease settings; and (iv) they often did not
establish appropriate endpoints of therapeutic response/outcome, such as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We recently conducted an in-depth series of
preclinical case studies in which we assessed the translational
use of 2 highly validated Kras-mutant GEMMs, one of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and one of pancreatic ductal

adenocarcinoma [PDAC (9)]. In this study, we ﬁrst deﬁned
several requirements for more-accurate simulation of human
clinical trials in GEMMs, and then we examined combinations
of chemotherapy and targeted therapeutics that have been
tested in key historical and recent trials. We showed that
GEMMs can indeed be used to recapitulate clinical trial data
accurately. Of note, in the case of combinations of the EGFR
inhibitor erlotinib and conventional chemotherapeutics, we
reproduced not only the subtle OS impact of erlotinib in
combination with gemcitabine observed in human pancreatic
cancer (10) but also the currently unexplained negative interactions seen in a subset of patients with NSCLC harboring
KRAS mutations (11). To simulate combination trials with the
human-speciﬁc anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, we used a
surrogate monoclonal antibody (B20-4.1.1) that binds murine
VEGF with a comparable afﬁnity (12). B20-4.1.1 treatment in
combination with carboplatin in the NSCLC GEMM resulted in
an OS improvement versus chemotherapy alone, similar to
what was observed in the pivotal Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial (ECOG 4599) that led to the approval of
bevacizumab for the treatment of NSCLC patients (13). However, the PDAC GEMM treated with the combination of
gemcitabine and B20-4.1.1 showed a mixed survival response:
approximately half of the mice showed no beneﬁt in comparison with gemcitabine alone, whereas the other half showed
improved survival. This was unlike the lack of any impact
observed with the addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine in
the corresponding human trial [Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) 80303 (14)]. The dichotomous survival pattern we
observed in the GEMM may be a reﬂection of tumor heterogeneity, especially considering the encouraging responses that
were seen in earlier phase II clinical trials (15), and it underscores the need to better understand and deﬁne responsive
patient subsets. In addition to OS, we attempted to model PFS
based on noninvasive imaging data from each of the abovementioned GEMM preclinical trials. To our knowledge, this
was the ﬁrst effort to assess this key endpoint in an animal
model. Most of the PFS data were concordant with the
observed OS patterns, although it was clear in some cases that
the imaging intervals we used did not always allow for adequate resolution and could beneﬁt from further reﬁnement.
Altogether, the results of this study attained the broad goal of
establishing a unique role for GEMMs in the assessment of
tumor therapies and laid the foundation for their preclinical
use by showing their translatability via multiple relevant
endpoints. It is also important to note that this study
adhered to strict U.S. and international guidelines concerning
animal welfare (16). Every model and preclinical study must
be uniquely evaluated, and investigators must always work
closely with their institutional animal care and use committee,
as well as veterinary and animal-care staff, to appropriately
deﬁne and follow humane endpoints (e.g., body weight,
activity, and condition) and specialty care prior to study
commencement.
The question now at hand is, How do we best leverage
the lessons learned from this and other studies to improve
the drug development process and success rate of human
clinical trials? GEMMs can inform several key aspects of

2696

the clinical process, as summarized in Fig. 1. First, complex
GEMMs have the potential to better reﬂect patient/tumor
diversity within a given indication, thereby inﬂuencing
patient selection through the discovery and validation of
new predictive biomarkers. For example, a majority of
pancreatic cancers (up to 90%) show mutation of KRAS
and exhibit concurrent inactivation of the P16/CDKN2A
locus; additionally, TP53 is commutated in a subset of these
tumors [up to 70% (17, 18)]. However, data in the literature regarding the TP53 mutation as a prognostic indicator for this disease, and how it may inﬂuence the response
to standard-of-care gemcitabine chemotherapy, are conﬂicting (19, 20). Of interest, Olive and colleagues (21)
recently showed that the desmoplastic stroma could serve
as a barrier to gemcitabine delivery in a Trp53 mutant
PDAC GEMM. Of note, this negative impact on drug delivery, and consequently efﬁcacy, was unique to the spontaneous GEMM and was not observed in either subcutaneous
or orthotopic implant models. Taken together, these data
indicate that TP53 status may serve as a predictive biomarker for treatment response in PDAC. This hypothesis
can be tested with extant mutant Kras–driven pancreatic
cancer GEMMs that represent all possible combinations
of Kras mutation with P16/Cdkn2A and Trp53 tumor suppressor inactivation (22). The availability of these GEMMs
also makes it possible to interrogate p53 modulation of
response to combinations of gemcitabine with novel agents,
which could be particularly important for agents that
modulate cell-cycle progression and/or apoptosis. Nevertheless, even with the ever-increasing repertoire of animal
models that emulate key genetic driver mutations found in
various human cancers, it is important to highlight that
many GEMMs do not fully recapitulate all aspects of the
clinical population, including the full extent of genetic
diversity and metastatic spread (23). However, as a result
of the differences between humans and mice, GEMMs
provide a unique opportunity for both identifying and
validating modiﬁers of tumor progression and therapeutic
response. Because mice are inbred and inherently less
genetically diverse than humans, investigators can use
them to decipher which mutations are actually worth
pursuing by cross-referencing tumors and/or tumor types
driven by the same genetic alterations in both mice and
humans (24). Moreover, the ability to have truly normal,
strain-matched genetic controls in mice may prove invaluable for interpreting the relevance of thousands of genetic
changes that are revealed upon whole-genome sequencing
of human tumors and metastases (25, 26). As pharmacogenomic criteria become increasingly de rigueur for patient
stratiﬁcation in early clinical trials (27), GEMMs have the
potential to both enable the investigation of basic aspects
of tumor biology (which may not be possible in the clinic)
and provide proof-of-concept for novel targeted agents and
companion biomarkers.
GEMMs can also play a key role in elucidating the
mechanisms of therapeutic response and innate resistance
to both chemotherapy and targeted agents. Indeed, GEMMs
have already been successfully applied in this manner to

Translating Preclinical Trials into Prediction

Figure 1. Use of GEMMs for preclinical development. The ﬁgure depicts the established route for human clinical trial development and which steps may be
informed by GEMMs. These models can be used to further validate both known and newly discovered cancer targets and pathways. In addition, they may
facilitate the identiﬁcation and validation of relevant pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, predictive, and prognostic biomarkers for evaluating drug
efﬁcacy, toxicity, and various survival endpoints. Although GEMMs may be limited to certain patient populations and subsets of disease, their overall use
may be critical for informing ﬁrst-line clinical trial design as well as refractory and resistant disease progression for better therapeutic identiﬁcation and
patient safety.

investigate intrinsic resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic agents in acute myeloid leukemia (28). The
notion that GEMMs may be able to enhance our understanding of inherent response versus resistance to targeted
therapies is exempliﬁed by the current debate on the use of
KRAS mutations to stratify patients receiving EGFR inhibitors. Although it is clear that RAS mutations are drivers of
poor prognosis in several cancers, the implementation of
KRAS mutational status as a predictive biomarker is relatively recent and still controversial (29, 30). This is particularly important because adverse interactions resulting from
EGFR inhibition in patients with KRAS mutant tumors have
only been observed in a subset of trials within a given
indication (NSCLC or colorectal cancer) and when these
agents were combined with some (but not all) chemotherapeutics. Even in the latter case, the effects varied with the
dosing regimen. For example, no deleterious effects were
observed in NSCLC patients whose tumors harbored KRAS
mutations when erlotinib was dosed sequentially (the SATURN study) versus concurrently [the TRIBUTE study
(11, 31, 32)]. Furthermore, these effects could also depend
on the tumor type, as the combination of erlotinib with
gemcitabine resulted in both PFS and OS beneﬁts in patients
with pancreatic cancer, a population in which the majority
of tumors harbor KRAS mutations (10). Hence, a more

rigorous investigation and understanding of the mechanisms that inﬂuence KRAS mutant tumor responses, such as
wild-type EGFR, ERBB3, cMET, and phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K) pathway activation levels, is critically needed
to better inform and guide patient stratiﬁcation criteria
based on KRAS mutational status (33–36). Given that
GEMMs recapitulate these subtle differences, these models
offer a means to systematically dissect the underlying
mechanisms of interaction between EGFR inhibition and
perturbation of RAS signaling in the context of therapeutic
intervention, a vital issue that cannot be easily investigated
via clinical trials alone. Along these lines, Zhou and colleagues (37) recently used nongermline GEMMs for NSCLC
harboring Her2, Egfr, and Kras mutations to show differential
activation of the PI3K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
signaling pathways in tumors with mutant Her receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) compared with mutant Kras lesions,
and they correlated the results with treatment response to a
small-molecule EGFR inhibitor. Similarly, Engelman and
colleagues (38) used a Kras-mutant NSCLC GEMM to examine the combinatorial efﬁcacy of mitogen-activated protein–
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) and PI3K inhibitors, a strategy that is now being pursued clinically.
However, the modulation of these downstream pathways

by targeted therapy in either clinically relevant ﬁrst-line (in
combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy) or
refractory settings still requires detailed investigation, as
does the question of how these same pathway alterations
modulate therapeutic response in other KRAS-mutant indications, such as PDAC.
Finally, the use of GEMMs may enable investigators to
explore both the feasibility and validity of a personalized
medicine approach. In two recent studies of patients
with NSCLC, Kim and colleagues (39) and Sequist and
colleagues (40) addressed the issue of whether we can
tailor customized treatment regimens for patients based
on their tumor's molecular proﬁle as well as the evolution
of resistance to targeted therapy. The landmark phase II
BATTLE (Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted
Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination) study (39) showed
for the ﬁrst time that tumor biopsies from previously
treated patients with advanced NSCLC could be safely
collected and effectively analyzed in real time for a large
number of diverse biomarkers to facilitate personalized
treatment. The results are encouraging and suggest that
biomarker-driven patient stratiﬁcation has the potential to
increase overall treatment efﬁcacy and response rates;
however, this remains to be conﬁrmed in larger phase III
trials. The Bayesian trial design used in BATTLE allowed
the investigators to observe correlations that might not
have been predicted a priori. An intriguing example of this
is the somewhat unexpected and promising relationship
observed between KRAS- or BRAF-mutant disease and
responsiveness to sorafenib. It seems highly likely that the
trial design and adaptive randomization approach facilitated this particular observation, at least in part, by steering a preponderance of patients who were positive for the
KRAS/BRAF biomarker signature toward the sorafenib arm
and away from the 2 EGFR-inhibitor–containing arms.
Currently, no targeted therapies have been speciﬁcally
approved for KRAS-mutant NSCLC; therefore, it will be
very interesting to determine whether this relationship
will withstand further testing in NSCLC as well as other
mutant KRAS–driven cancers. Moreover, it will be important to discern which mechanism(s) and cell population(s)
targeted by sorafenib (e.g., tumor cell and/or endothelial
cell compartment) mediate this efﬁcacious response, particularly given that speciﬁc targeting of VEGF signaling is
sufﬁcient to provide highly signiﬁcant improvements in
both PFS and OS in the KrasLSL-G12D; p53frt/frt NSCLC GEMM
(9). Lastly, it will be interesting to see whether more
selective and/or potent inhibitors of the VEGF/R2 and
RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways, and combinations
thereof, can provide an even greater response rate. The
availability of well-validated, mutant Kras–driven GEMMs
of NSCLC and PDAC gives investigators a valuable preclinical opportunity to interrogate each of these questions in a
controlled and accessible manner.
In the second study, Sequist and colleagues (40) applied a
serial tumor biopsy approach to examine the spectrum of
alterations that arose in a small cohort of patients who had
been subjected to targeted EGFR inhibitors as well as more

2698

conventional, follow-on treatment regimens. The authors
identiﬁed both previously reported and novel alterations. Of
importance, these studies show that real-time tumor biopsies from patients in clinical trials can yield invaluable
information about the mechanisms of both therapeutic
response and resistance. However, this approach can have
signiﬁcant practical limitations in terms of tumor accessibility, particularly for serial biopsies, as well as patient
safety and availability (41). Although human tumor cell
lines and explants provide additional systems for interrogating therapeutic response and resistance both in vitro and
in vivo (42–44), they cannot mimic the complete array of
interactions that occur among the diverse cellular players
that constitute the innate tumor microenvironment and
metastatic niche(s), or the contributions made by each
player. As such, they can never reveal the full repertoire of
alterations that mediate efﬁcacy and/or acquired resistance
that arises in response to therapy. Thus, GEMMs, with their
ability to mimic therapeutic resistance in toto and increased
tumor tissue accessibility, could provide an invaluable
means to model therapeutic response, refractory patient
populations, and the dynamic evolution of tumors on
treatment. An excellent example of GEMMs applied in this
fashion is found in the work of Politi and colleagues (45),
who showed that mouse models of mutant EGFR–driven
lung carcinomas give rise to drug-resistant tumors that
exhibit the same molecular changes that confer resistance
in human lung cancers when treated with the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor erlotinib. Similarly, GEMMs have been
successfully used to model acquired resistance to chemotherapy and have provided key insights into the underlying
mechanisms and cell types involved. For example, a model
of BRCA1-related breast cancer was used to show that even
subtle alterations in the levels of a drug efﬂux transporter in
tumor cells can confer resistance to doxorubicin (46, 47). In
addition, Gilbert and Hemann (48) recently used a wellestablished mouse model of Burkitt's lymphoma to show
that stromal factors released from thymic endothelial cells
can create a chemoresistant niche that fosters lymphoma
cell survival following chemotherapy and eventual tumor
relapse. It is important to note that biomedical imaging and
other readouts (e.g., circulating tumor cells and serumbased biomarkers) will be needed to facilitate preclinical
efforts that are less amenable to real-time and serial tumor
biopsies (e.g., GEMMs of lung or pancreatic cancer vs. skin,
breast, or colorectal cancer).
In conclusion, recent preclinical studies in GEMMs have
made substantial strides in modeling clinically relevant
endpoints and making germane predictions regarding
human responses as well as resistance to targeted therapies
(and combinations thereof). In this era of molecular medicine, the ability to recapitulate clinical oncology scenarios
in the appropriate microenvironmental context uniquely
qualiﬁes GEMMs as platforms for discovering predictive
biomarkers, elucidating the determinants of clinical
responses, and understanding the mechanisms by which
tumors evolve resistance to increasingly complex therapeutic strategies.
