ABSTRACT
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in cancer cell tumorigenesis, cell
cycle control, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis and drug resistance. The
BRAF-activated non-coding RNA (BANCR) functions as both an oncogene and a tumor
suppressor. Here, we investigated BANCR’s role in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)
by assessing BANCR levels in PTC and matched normal thyroid epithelial tissues from
92 patients using qRT-PCR. We also used lentiviral vectors to establish PTC cell lines to
investigate the effects of BANCR overexpression on cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis,
migration and invasion. Our results indicate BANCR levels are lower in PTC tumor
tissues than control tissues. Decreased BANCR levels correlate with tumor size, the
presence of multifocal lesions and advanced PTC stage. BANCR overexpression reduced
PTC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, which inhibited metastasis. It also
inactivated ERK1/2 and p38, and this effect was enhanced by treatment with the MEK
inhibitor U0126. Finally, BANCR overexpression dramatically inhibited tumor growth
from PTC cells in xenograft mouse models. These results suggest BANCR inhibits
tumorigenesis in PTC and that BANCR levels may be used as a novel prognostic marker.

INTRODUCTION

tumorigenesis, progression, proliferation, metastasis
and apoptosis [4]. For example, the upregulation of the
lncRNA HNF1A-AS1 promotes tumor proliferation
and metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma by regulating
the expression of cyclin D1, E-cadherin and β-catenin
[5]. Also, the lncRNA CCAL regulates colorectal
cancer progression by activating the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway and suppressing activator protein
2α [6]. PTCSC3, another lncRNA gene, confers PTC
predisposition and promotes carcinogenesis through the
S100A4 pathway [2]. Additionally, lncRNA-Hh promotes
cancer stem cell generation by activating the hedgehog
signaling pathway [7].
BRAF-activated lncRNA (BANCR) was first
identified by Flockhart RJ et al. in 2012 via RNA
sequencing. This molecule is a non-annotated, 693-bplong transcript on chromosome 9 that reduces cell
migration in melanoma [8]. BANCR has been reported
to function as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer [9]
while acting as an oncogene in various types of cancer

The incidence of thyroid cancer, the most common
endocrine malignancy, has increased by 3-fold over the
last three decades. Approximately 80–85% of all thyroid
cancers are papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) [1]. The
5-year survival rate of patients with PTC is over 95%;
however, PTCs with more aggressive phenotypes can
occasionally disseminate into distant tissues and lymph
nodes or dedifferentiate into more lethal thyroid cancers
[2]. Conventional management of PTC, including surgery,
hormone therapy and radioactive iodine therapy are
generally not curative in metastatic cases [1, 3]. Therefore,
novel therapeutic approaches and individual treatment
strategies are needed to treat patients with metastatic
thyroid cancer [2]. For example, the genetic and epigenetic
alterations associated with PTC pathogenesis may serve as
novel prognostic markers or therapeutic targets.

invasion assays using TPC-1-BANCR and K1-BANCR
cells. The wound-healing assay results revealed that
BANCR overexpression slows down the closing rate
of scratch wounds compared with that of control cells
(P < 0.05) (Figure 4A–4B). The transwell invasion assay
results showed that increased BANCR expression inhibits
TPC-1-BANCR and K1-BANCR (P < 0.05) cell invasion
compared with controls (Figure 4C).

RESULTS
BANCR expression is downregulated in PTC
tissue and cell lines
To measure BANCR expression in PTC tissue, total
RNA extracted from 92 paired human PTC samples and
adjacent histologically normal tissues was assessed using
SYBR Green qPCR analysis. As shown in Figure 1A–1B,
BANCR expression was downregulated in 68.5% (63/92;
P < 0.05) of the PTC tissue compared to the normal tissue.
Total RNA was also isolated from four PTC cell
lines (TPC-1, K1, BCPAP, and CGTH-W3) and one
normal human thyroid epithelial cell line (Nthy-ori 3-1)
to evaluate BANCR expression. Compared to Nthy-ori-3
cells, BANCR expression was downregulated in TPC-1
(P = 0.0081), K1 (P = 0.0033) and BCPAP (P = 0.0119)
cells but not in CGTH-W3 cells (P = 0.1129) (Figure 1C).

ERK1/2 and P38, but not AKT or JNK, are
inactivated by BANCR upregulation
To investigate whether the ERK/MAPK signaling
pathway is involved in the upregulation of BANCR
observed in PTC cells, the expression levels of total
and phosphorylated ERK, AKT, MEK, JNK and P38
were measured by western blot. As shown in Figure 5A,
phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated P38 were
downregulated in K1-BANCR cells, but not in TPC-1BANCR cells, while the total levels of these molecules
(i.e., both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) did
not change in either cell line. However, neither total
nor phosphorylated AKT and JNK levels were affected
in either cell line. In addition, treatment with the MEK
inhibitor U0126 inhibited proliferation (P < 0.05)
(Figure 5B) and impaired invasion (P < 0.05) (Figure 5C)
in K1-BANCR cells relative to control K1-NC cells.
Furthermore, levels of phosphorylated ERK were reduced
in K1-BANCR cells following treatment with U0126
(Figure 5D).

BANCR overexpression inhibits PTC proliferation
and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo
To elucidate the role of BANCR in PTC cell
proliferation and apoptosis, we established BANCRoverexpressing PTC cell models using the TPC-1 and
K1 cell lines and lentivirus vectors. Increased BANCR
expression in these infected PTC cell lines was confirmed
using qPCR (Figure 2A). Proliferation of BANCRoverexpressing PTC cell lines TPC-1-BANCR and
K1-BANCR was evaluated in vitro using a CCK-8 cell
proliferation assay. Our results show that K1-BANCR
proliferation is impaired compared to that of control
cells (P < 0.05), while TPC-1-BANCR proliferation
is unaffected (Figure 2B). Apoptosis analysis by flow
cytometry showed that BANCR overexpression promotes
apoptosis in both the TPC-1-BANCR and K1-BANCR
cell lines compared to TPC-1-NC (P < 0.05) and K1-NC
(P < 0.05) control cells (Figure 2C).
To investigate the effects of BANCR on PTC cell
proliferation and apoptosis in vivo, we used subcutaneous
xenograft mouse models engrafted with either K1-BANCR
or control K1-NC cells. Average tumor weight and size were
smaller in the K1-BANCR group than in the control group,
indicating that tumor growth is inhibited in K1-BANCR
mice (Figure 3A–3B). Furthermore, Ki67+ tumor cell number
as measured by IHC is reduced (Figure 3C) and BANCR
expression measured by qPCR is increased (Figure 3D) in
the K1-BANCR group compared with the control group.

BANCR downregulation correlates with poor
prognosis in PTC patients
To test whether BANCR correlates with prognosis
in PTC patients, we measured the correlation between
BANCR expression and several pathological parameters
in PTC patients. Our results show that downregulation
of BANCR expression correlates with tumor size
(P < 0.05), the presence of multifocal lesions (P < 0.05)
and advanced pathological stage (P < 0.05) in PTC tissues.
However, BANCR expression did not correlate with other
clinicopathologic parameters, such as age (P = 0.214),
gender (P = 0.711), extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.406),
or lymph node metastasis (P = 0.992) in PTC tissue
compared with normal thyroid tissues (Table 1). These
results suggest that low BANCR levels are associated with
poor outcomes in PTC patients.

DISCUSSION

BANCR overexpression suppresses PTC cell
migration and invasion

Ectopic expression of BANCR shown in multiple
cancer types may due to tumor heterogenicity; these
findings motivated us to explore the effects of BANCR
in PTC and to delineate the associated mechanisms. In
the current study, we found that BANCR levels were

decreased in 92 human PTC tissues compared to adjacent
normal thyroid tissues. We also found that lower BANCR
expression correlates with advanced tumor stage and size.
We observed elevated BANCR levels in 86.2% earlystage PTC and 13.8% late-stage PTC tumors. Our results
suggest that PTC tumors with high BANCR levels are
more differentiated than those with low BANCR levels and
that BANCR may function as a tumor suppressor in PTC.
We also investigated the role of BANCR in PTC
cells utilizing BANCR-overexpressing TPC-1 and K1
cells as in vitro models. Our results show that BANCR
overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, migration and
invasion while inducing tumor cell apoptosis. In xenograft
mouse models, K1 cells overexpressing BANCR exhibited
lower tumor proliferation. Our in vitro and in vivo data
show that BANCR acts as a tumor suppressor that
inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, in line with the
clinicopathological data. In a previous study [12],
Zheng H et al. demonstrated that BANCR is upregulated in
human PTC tissue and IHH4 cells and that this promotes
cell growth and proliferation. The discrepancy with our
results may stem from differences in the numbers of tissue
samples tested (92 in our current study vs. 40 in Zheng H
et al.) and in the BANCR expression patterns of different
cell lines (we used TPC-1 and K1 cells while Zheng H
et al. used IHH4 cells).
Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway
promotes human cancer cell proliferation and survival,

particularly in PTC [3, 13]. BRAF and RAS mutations
activate the MAPK signaling pathway in thyroid cancer,
inducing the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK,
and P38 kinase, amplifying oncogenicity [3]. BANCR
is normally activated by BRAF; however, 30–60% of
PTCs contain the BRAFV600E mutation, which has been
associated with higher mortality [14] and recurrence
[15, 16] rates. BRAF-activated BANCR has been shown to
promote cell migration and proliferation in melanoma [10]
and lung carcinoma [17] via the MAPK signaling pathway.
However, whether BANCR exerts MAPK-dependent
effects in PTC remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that
BANCR overexpression in the BRAFV600E-mutated PTC
cell line K1 inactivates ERK1/2 and P38. Furthermore, this
inactivation was blocked by the MAPK pathway selective
inhibitor U0126, without altering BRAF’s effects in wildtype TPC-1 cells. These results suggest interplay between
the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway and BANCR in PTC,
highlighting BANCR as a potential therapeutic target for
the treatment of BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer.
In this study, we report that BRAF-activated
BANCR may function as a tumor suppressor via the
ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in PTC. However, our
results might be biased towards early-stage PTC given
the disparity between the number of early-stage (n = 66)
vs. late-stage (n = 26) PTC patients in our sample. This
difference might result from new diagnostic methods
that allow detecting PTC earlier, yielding more patients

with micro-papillary cancer (early stage; tumor size
< 0.5 cm) than with papillary cancer (late stage; tumor
size > 0.5 cm). Interestingly, the results from our cell
proliferation and apoptosis assays varied for TPC-1 and
K1 cells overexpressing BANCR. This might be attributed
to the different BRAF status of these cells, warranting
further investigations.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that BANCR
induces proliferation, migration and invasiveness in
BRAF-mutated PTC cells partially via the ERK/MAPK
signaling pathway and that BANCR expression is
downregulated in human PTC tissues. Therefore, our
results suggest that BANCR may serve as a potential
therapeutic target and that decreased BANCR levels could
be used as a novel prognostic marker for PTC.

Clinical specimen collection
A total of 92 pairs of PTC tumor and adjacent
normal tissue were obtained from patients who underwent
surgical resection at the Department of Head and Neck
Surgery at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center
between 2012 and 2015. The study was performed
in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was
approved by the Human Ethics Committee/Institutional
Review Board of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer
Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all
92 patients. The diagnosis of PTC was histopathologically
confirmed, and no patient received preoperative treatment.

The following clinicopathological characteristics were
documented: age, gender, and PTC features, including
tumor size, location, multifocal lesions, bilateral lesions,
extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis and
TNM classification. The resected tissue samples were
immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
–80°C for further use.

TPC-1-NC and K1-NC in accordance with the lentiviral
construct used in each. BANCR expression was confirmed
by qPCR.

CCK8 cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was determined using a
cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded into
96-well plates at 4 × 103 cells/well. An aliquot of 10 μl
CCK-8 solution was added to each well, and the plate
was incubated for 4 h at 37°C. At the indicated time
points, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a
spectrophotometer. For each group, data from five wells
were pooled.

Cell culture and treatment
Four PTC cell lines (TPC-1, K1, BCPAP and
CGTH-W3) and a normal human thyroid epithelial cell
line (Nthy-ori 3-1) were used. Nthy-ori-3 and TPC-1 cell
lines were provided by Dr. Haixia Guan. K1 was gifted by
Dr. Zebing Liu. BCPAP cell lines were purchased from the
Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The CGTH-W3
cell line was obtained from Dr. Jun Xiang. All cell lines
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO), 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37°C in 5% CO2. For inhibitor
treatment experiments, the cell lines were treated with
either DMSO or 10 μM U0126 for 48 h.

Analysis of apoptosis by flow cytometry
Cells were harvested, washed in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and stained with Annexin V-PE
and 7-AAD in Annexin-binding buffer (BD Biosciences,
Mississauga, ON) for 15 min at room temperature in the
dark. As controls, cells were either not stained, stained
with Annexin V-PE only or stained with 7-AAD only.
Following the addition of 400 μl binding buffer, the cells
were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptotic
cells were marked based on Annexin V expression
(Annexin V+/7-AAD- and Annexin V+/7-AAD+),
quantified and compared to the controls from each group.
The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Total RNA extraction, reverse transcription and
quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from tissues and cultured
cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 1 μg of RNA
was reverse-transcribed using a PrimeScript RT reagent
kit (Takara, Dalian, China). For quantitative real-time
PCR (qPCR), cDNA was amplified using SYBR Green
Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Dalian, China) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. BANCR expression was
normalized against GAPDH mRNA expression in
three independent experiments. The following primers
were used for qPCR: BANCR forward sequence,
5′-ACAGGACTCCATGGCAAACG-3′; reverse sequence,
5′-ATGAAGAAAGCCTGGTGCAGT-3′. The results were
analyzed and calculated relative to cycle threshold values
and then converted into fold changes.

Wound-healing assay
To evaluate cell migration, a wound-healing assay
was performed. To accomplish this, 2 × 105 cells/well
were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured until the cells
reached 90% confluence. Artificial wounds were created
by scraping using a sterile 200 μl pipette tip. The streaked
cells were then washed with PBS 3 times and cultured
in medium containing 1% FBS for 48 h. Cell migration
was observed at 0 h and 48 h by analyzing phase-contrast
images that were captured using an inverted microscope.
The distance between the two edges of a wound was
calculated using Image J software.

Generation of BANCR-overexpressing cell lines

Transwell cell invasion assay

Recombinant lentiviruses packing genomes
encoding human full-length BANCR (LV-BANCR) and a
negative control sequence (LV-NC) were purchased from
GENECHEM (Shanghai, China). TPC-1 and K1 cells were
infected with either LV-BANCR or LV-NC plus 5 μg/ml
polybrene (GENECHEM, Shanghai, China). Infection
efficiency was examined by qPCR 48 h after infection, and
the cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin to create
stable overexpression cell lines. The infected TPC-1 and
K1 cells were denoted as TPC-1-BANCR, K1-BANCR,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To perform a transwell invasion assay, 2 × 104 cells
were suspended in 100 μl serum-free medium and placed
on the non-coated membranes of the upper chambers
of a transwell plate insert (24-well insert, 8  μm pore
size; BD Biosciences). Following this, 600  μl medium
with 10% FBS was added into each lower chamber.
After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, the cells remaining
on the upper membranes were removed with a cotton
swab. The migrated or invaded cells were fixed with

at room temperature. A DAB substrate development
system was used to detect protein expression. Images were
obtained using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope.
Ki67+ cells were counted using Image J software.

Western blotting

Statistical analysis

Cells were lysed in RIPA protein extraction
reagent supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, CA, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Protein concentration was measured using a
bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA). Equal amounts of total
protein lysate were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto PVDF membranes. After blocking in 5%
non-fat milk, the membranes were probed with targeted
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and detected by
incubating with specific secondary antibodies for 2 h at
room temperature. ECL chromogenic substrate with HRP
was used to visualize the protein bands, and the intensities
of the bands were quantified using Image J software.
GAPDH served as an internal loading control. Primary
anti-human antibodies against total Akt, Erk1/2, P38, and
JNK and phosphorylated-Akt, Erk1/2, P38, and JNK were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA).

All statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 5.1. The results are presented as the
mean ± the standard error of the mean. The statistical
significance of inter-group differences was determined
using the Student’s t-test. Correlation analyses were
assessed using the Pearson correlation and linear
regression analyses.
