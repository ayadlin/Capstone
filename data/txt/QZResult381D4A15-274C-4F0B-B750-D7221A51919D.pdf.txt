ABSTRACT
Aldosterone induces relevant effects binding to the mineralcorticoid receptor
(MR), which acts as a ligand-gated transcription factor. Alternate mechanisms
can mediate the action of aldosterone such as the activation of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), MAPK/ERK, transcription factors and ion channels. The
G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER) has been involved in the stimulatory effects
of estrogenic signalling in breast cancer. GPER has been also shown to contribute
to certain responses to aldosterone, however the role played by GPER and the
molecular mechanisms implicated remain to be fully understood. Here, we evaluated
the involvement of GPER in the stimulatory action exerted by aldosterone in breast
cancer cells and breast tumor derived endothelial cells (B-TEC). Competition assays,
gene expression and silencing studies, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
experiments, cell proliferation and migration were performed in order to provide
novel insights into the role of GPER in the aldosterone-activated signalling. Our results
demonstrate that aldosterone triggers the EGFR/ERK transduction pathway in a MRand GPER-dependent manner. Aldosterone does not bind to GPER, it however induces
the direct interaction between MR and GPER as well as between GPER and EGFR. Next,
we ascertain that the up-regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE-1) induced by
aldosterone involves MR and GPER. Biologically, both MR and GPER contribute to the
proliferation and migration of breast and endothelial cancer cells mediated by NHE-1
upon aldosterone exposure. Our data further extend the current knowledge on the
molecular mechanisms through which GPER may contribute to the stimulatory action
elicited by aldosterone in breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

salt and water balance toward the regulation of systemic
blood pressure [5]. In addition, aldosterone activates ionic
membrane transporters as the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) and Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBC), which regulate
the cellular pH and volume [6-7]. Aldosterone has been
also involved in diverse cardio-metabolic diseases as
it triggers inflammatory and fibrotic responses in both
heart and vessels [8-11]. Recent studies have suggested
that aldosterone/MR signalling may contribute to the
progression of certain types of tumor [12-13]. For
instance, it has been shown that aldosterone stimulates

Aldosterone elicits multiple biological effects
binding to the mineralcorticoid receptor (MR), which acts
as a ligand-gated transcription factor [1]. In addition, rapid
aldosterone signalling involves alternate mechanisms
that include the activation of transduction pathways like
tyrosine kinase c-Src, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and MAPK/ERK cascade [2-4]. Aldosterone is
a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (RAAS), which is mainly implicated in maintaining

the survival and proliferation of renal carcinoma cells by
upregulating K-RAS and the activation of the Akt and Raf
pathways [12]. Moreover, an aldosterone blocker inhibited
the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma and angiogenesis
both in vitro and in vivo [13].
The G-protein estrogen receptor namely GPER
mediates several pathophysiological functions in the
cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems,
glucose and fat metabolism [14]. In addition, our and
other previous studies have largely demonstrated that
estrogenic GPER signalling elicits stimulatory effects in
cancer cells and tumor microenvironment toward cancer
progression [14-19]. In this regard, it has been reported
that GPER activation triggers diverse transduction
pathways involved in the proliferation, invasion and
migration of tumor cells, including the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/
AKT transduction cascades, Ca2+ mobilization and cAMP
production [20-27]. Numerous endogenous, environmental
and newly synthesized molecules have been shown to
trigger relevant GPER-mediated responses in different cell
contexts [28-36]. Aldosterone has been recently suggested
to act through GPER in diverse models, including the
cardiovascular and renal systems [6, 37-40]. For instance,
it was demonstrated that GPER is involved in important
effects exerted by aldosterone on vascular endothelial
cells, cardiac vagal tone and connecting tubule glomerular
feedback [37-40]. These observations have pointed out
the potential of GPER to contribute to the aldosterone
action, however the effective role played by GPER and
the molecular mechanisms implicated are controversial
as pharmacologic criteria for considering GPER as an
aldosterone receptor have been not adequately fulfilled
[41-43].
In the framework of the aforementioned
observations, the current study provides novel insights into
the role of GPER in mediating the action of aldosterone
in breast tumor. In particular, our data show that a
functional cross-talk between MR and GPER may occur
upon aldosterone treatment leading to stimulatory effects
in both breast cancer cells and endothelial cells obtained
from breast malignancies.

ERα (Supplementary Figure 1). Of note, pM aldosterone
concentrations induced the phosphorylation of EGFR and
ERK1/2 in both SkBr3 cells and B-TEC (Figure 1A-1D),
though these effects were no longer evident silencing the
expression of MR (Figure 1E-1J). Recently, it has been
reported that GPER contributes to aldosterone action
although the mechanisms involved remain to be fully
understood [6, 38-44]. In this vein, we therefore performed
saturation curves and scatchard plot analyses using as
radiotracers the GPER ligand [3H]E2 [28, 31-32, 34-36]
and the MR ligand [3H]aldosterone. [3H]E2 showed an
estimated Bmax corresponding to 6799 ± 707.8 cpm/1 ×
105 SkBr3 cells and an estimated Kd corresponding to 8.16
± 1.70 nM (Figure 2A), whereas [3H]aldosterone showed
an estimated Bmax corresponding to 2159 ± 229.2 cpm/1
× 105 SkBr3 cells and an estimated Kd corresponding to
0.42 ± 0.08 nM (Figure 2B). In competition assays, E2
but not aldosterone displaced [3H]E2 (Figure 2C), while
aldosterone but not E2 displaced [3H]Aldosterone (Figure
2D). Collectively, these findings argue that in SkBr3 cells
aldosterone is not able to displace [3H]E2, which was used
as a GPER radioligand.
In order to gain further insights into the role of
GPER in certain biological responses to aldosterone, we
then evaluated the possible interaction of GPER and MR
and EGFR. Our immunoprecipitation data indicated that
aldosterone triggers a direct interaction between GPER
and MR as well as GPER and EGFR (Figure 2E-2L).
Immunofluorescence experiments performed in SkBr3
cells further corroborated the aforementioned results as
an increased merged (orange) signal of MR and GPER
was observed upon a short (15 min) aldosterone treatment
(Figure 2M-2O). Altogether, these data suggest that
GPER may contribute to aldosterone/MR-activated EGFR
signalling.

GPER is involved in the aldosterone-mediated
signalling
On the basis of the abovementioned observations,
we performed gene silencing experiments in order to
assess whether GPER is involved in the rapid signalling
induced by aldosterone. Interestingly, the activation of
both EGFR and ERK1/2 by aldosterone was no longer
evident silencing GPER in both SkBr3 cells and B-TEC
(Figure 3A-3F). In accordance with these findings,
the GPER antagonist G15 prevented the EGFR/ERK
phosphorylation upon aldosterone exposure (Figure 3G3I). Next, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478
(AG) but not the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (PD) blocked
EGFR phosphorylation by aldosterone (Figure 3G-3I),
while ERK1/2 activation was prevented in the presence
of both AG and PD. Hence, the MEK/ERK transduction
pathway is activated afterward the engagement of
EGFR upon aldosterone treatment in our model system.

Aldosterone/MR signalling stimulates the activity and
expression of NHE-1, which has been involved in tumor
cell migration, invasion and metastasis particularly in
breast cancer [6-7, 45]. In this regard, we assessed that
aldosterone prompts NHE-1 activity in both SkBr3
cells and B-TEC as evaluated by a fluorescent indicator
of cytoplasmic pH changes (Figure 4A). In addition,
aldosterone up-regulated NHE-1 at both the mRNA and
protein levels as determined by real time PCR (Figure 4B)
and immunofluorescence studies performed in SkBr3 cells
and B-TEC (Figure 4C-4F). Next, the stimulatory effects
induced by aldosterone on NHE-1 protein expression
were abolished silencing MR (Figure 5) as well as GPER
(Figure 6). Collectively, these findings suggest that NHE-1
regulation by aldosterone requires MR along with GPER.

[7, 45]. We have also evidenced that aldosterone does not
bind to GPER in accordance with previous studies [44],
however it triggers the direct interaction between MR
and GPER as well as GPER and EGFR. Interestingly, we
have determined that both MR and GPER are required for
the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells and
B-TEC mediated by NHE-1 upon aldosterone exposure.
Aldosterone elicits important biological effects
in several physio-pathological conditions, spanning
from electrolyte and fluid homeostasis to the regulation
of fibrotic, inflammatory, proliferative and angiogenic
responses in cardiovascular, metabolic diseases and
cancer [12-13, 46-49]. As it concerns the breast tissue,
it has been demonstrated that aldosterone potentiates
prolactin stimulation of casein synthesis in pregnant
rabbit mammary gland and contributes to mammary gland
development and differentiation [50].
The actions exerted by aldosterone mainly
occur through the binding to MR, a ligand-inducible
transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor
superfamily [1]. The enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type II (11βHSD2), which catalyzes the
conversion of 11β-hydroxycorticosteroids like cortisol
and corticosterone to the respective 11-keto metabolites
namely cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, does
allow the aldosterone binding to MR [51]. 11βHSD2
is mainly expressed in mineralcorticoid target tissues
like kidney, colon, salivary glands and placenta [51]. In
addition, immunohistochemical studies have detected
in normal and malignant breast tissues high levels of
11β-HSD2 that co-localize with MR [52]. Previous
studies have also evaluated the 11β-HSD2 activity in
breast cancer cells, suggesting that this enzyme may
play a regulatory role of aldosterone action in breast
malignancy [53]. According to the classical model of
MR signalling, the interaction between aldosterone and
un-liganded receptor promotes the dissociation of the
heat shock proteins from MR, which translocates into the
nucleus [1]. Then, the aldosterone/MR complex binds to
specific response elements located within the regulatory
region of target genes, hence resulting in gene expression
changes [1]. In addition, aldosterone induces rapid effects
through alternate mechanisms including the activation of
the EGFR/ERK transduction pathway, as demonstrated
in different animal and cell models [3-4]. The existence
of aldosterone receptors structurally unrelated to the
classic MR paved also the way for analyzing the role of
further mediators of the multifaceted action elicited by
aldosterone [49].
GPER has been largely demonstrated to mediate
estrogenic signalling in a wide number of physiopathological conditions, including cancer [54-64].
GPER has been also involved in functional responses
to aldosterone in various experimental contexts [3740]. For instance, the ability of aldosterone in activating
ERK1/2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and sensitizing

Aldosterone induces biological responses through
both MR and GPER
Functionally, we studied the role of MR and GPER
in the proliferative effects of aldosterone in breast tumor
cells as well as in the migration of tumor endothelial
cells. Indeed, aldosterone triggered growth effects in
SkBr3 cells, as assessed by cell counting (Figure 7A) and
evidenced by time-lapse video microscopy (Videos 1-2).
Cell proliferation stimulated by 10pM aldosterone was no
longer evident silencing MR (Figure 7B-7C) or knockingdown GPER expression (Figure 7D-7E) and using the
NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide (Figure 7F). Similar results
were obtained using aldosterone concentrations up to 10
nM (data not shown). Furthermore, aldosterone promoted
the migration of B-TEC as evidenced by time-lapse video
microscopy (Videos 3-4) and scratch assay (Figure 8).
The observed aldosterone-induced motility was abrogated
silencing MR (Figure 8A, 8B, 8F) or GPER (Figure
8C-8D, 8G) and in the presence of cariporide (Figure
8E). Overall, these results indicate that the functional
interaction between MR and GPER is involved in the
aforementioned stimulatory action of aldosterone in both
SkBr3 cells and B-TEC.

DISCUSSION
In the present study we provide novel evidence
regarding the molecular mechanisms by which GPER
may contribute to the biological responses induced by
aldosterone in breast cancer cells and breast tumor-derived
endothelial cells. In particular, we have demonstrated
that aldosterone activates the EGFR/ERK transduction
signalling through the classic MR and the involvement
of GPER, as evidenced by gene silencing experiments
and pharmacological inhibitors. In addition, we have
shown that both MR and GPER mediate the aldosteroneinduced up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE-1),
a well-known MR target involved in cancer progression

the connecting tubule glomerular feedback in afferent
arterioles was prevented using both MR and GPER
blockers [38-40]. Other studies evidenced that the increase
of cardiac vagal tone observed upon aldosterone treatment
is abolished in the presence of the GPER antagonist G36
but not using the MR antagonists spironolactone and
eplerenone [39]. In rat aortic endothelial cells devoid
of MR, the biological effects triggered by aldosterone
were mimicked by the GPER agonist G-1 and prevented
using pharmacological inhibitors of GPER as well as
knocking down its expression [38]. The aforementioned

observations suggest that GPER is involved in the effects
exerted by aldosterone either through MR or acting as
an alternate aldosterone receptor. However, it should be
pointed out that diverse controversies argue against the
last conclusion, as pharmacologic criteria for GPER to be
considered as an aldosterone-responsive receptor are not
still adequately fulfilled [41-43]. Indeed, binding studies
performed in HEK cells overexpressing GPER (HEKGPER-1) showed that aldosterone and the MR antagonists,
spironolactone and eplerenone, do not compete for specific
[3H]E2 binding to membrane of HEK-GPER-1 cells [44].

In accordance with these findings, in the present study
aldosterone failed to bind to GPER in competition assays
based on experimental approaches used in previous
investigations in order to characterize the binding
properties of GPER ligands [28, 31-32, 34-36]. Worthy, we
found that aldosterone stimulates the interaction of GPER
with MR and EGFR, thus suggesting a further mechanism
through which ligand-activated MR triggers EGFR
signalling [49, 65-67]. Nicely supporting the functional
cross-talk between MR and GPER, we ascertained that
both receptors are required for the aldosterone-induced
expression of NHE-1 which is considered as a molecular

sensor of MR activation [45]. In this respect, our data are
reminiscing of previous findings showing that EGFR and
GPER cooperate toward the regulation of NHE-1 function
upon aldosterone treatment [40, 66]. Importantly, we
found that the stimulatory effects elicited by aldosterone
on the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells
and breast tumor-derived endothelial cells are mediated
by NHE-1 and involve both GPER and MR. Hence, the
current results further extend the well-known action
played by NHE-1 toward negative biological features, in
particular in breast cancer [7, 68]. In this regard, it is worth
mentioning that in tumor metabolic microenvironment

characterized by hypoxic-acidic milieu [69], the
dysregulation of pH homeostasis mediated by NHE-1
may actually contribute to key steps in tumor progression
like increased cell proliferation, loss of cell-cell contact
and detachment from the extracellular matrix [68]. In
breast cancer cells and breast cancer associated fibroblasts
exposed to hypoxia, we have previously assessed that
GPER cooperates with hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF1) toward the regulation of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) and tumor angiogenesis [70-73]. Hence,
the present findings suggest further mechanisms through
which GPER may play a role in the complex adaptive
responses to hypoxic-acidic tumor microenvironment.
Additionally, our results indicate that GPER contributes
to the effects mediated by aldosterone/MR signalling, as
evidenced by other ligand-activated steroid receptors [7475].
Collectively, our findings provide novel insights
into the controversial mechanisms through which GPER
contributes to aldosterone-mediated signalling. On the
basis of our data showing that the functional interaction
between MR and GPER triggers certain stimulatory
effects exerted by aldosterone, GPER may be considered
as a further target within the intricate transduction network
activated by aldosterone in particular in breast cancer.

cell components from stroma and aggregates. Endothelial
cells were isolated from cells suspension using antiCD105 Ab coupled to magnetic beads, by magnetic
cell-sorting using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotech,

All cell lines were grown in a 37° C HeraCell incubator
(ThermoScientific-Heraeus, Milan, Italy) with 5% CO2.
Cells were switched to medium without serum the day
before experiments.

Saturation curve and scatchard plot analysis
SkBr3 cells were grown in 10-cm cell culture dishes
and incubated with increasing concentrations of [2, 4, 6,
7-3H] E2 (89 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) or [1, 2, 6, 7-3H]
Aldosterone (85 Ci/mmol; Perkinelmer). Cells were then
washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS);
after 100% ethanol extraction of cells, radioactivity was
measured by liquid scintillation counting. The plot of the
bound radioactivity (cpm) versus the concentration of the
radiotracer (nM) was fitted to the saturation binding curve
using Prism GraphPad program (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA), which was used to calculate the binding
dissociation constant (Kd) and binding capacity (Bmax).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Aldosterone (Aldo), 17β-estradiol (E2) and
Cariporide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan,
Italy). G15 ((3aS,4R,9bR)-4-(6-bromo-1,3-benzodioxol5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolone)
was
obtained from Tocris Bioscience (distributed by Space,
Milan, Italy). Tyrphostin AG1478 (AG) was purchased
from DBA (Milan, Itay). PD98059 (PD) was obtained
from Calbiochem (DBA, Milan, Italy). All compounds
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) except
Aldosterone and E2 which were solubilized in ethanol.

Ligand binding assay
SkBr3 cells were grown in 10-cm cell culture
dishes and incubated with 4 nM [2, 4, 6, 7-3H] E2 (89
Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) or 100 pM [1, 2, 6, 7-3H]
Aldosterone (85 Ci/mmol; Perkinelmer) in the presence
or absence of increasing concentrations of nonlabeled
E2 or aldosterone for 2 hours at 37°C. Cells were then
washed with ice-cold PBS; after 100% ethanol extraction
of cells, radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation
counting. The displacement of [3H]E2 or [3H]Aldo binding
by the competitors was expressed as a percentage of the
maximum specific binding of E2 or Aldo.

Cell cultures
SkBr3 breast cancer cells were maintained in
RPMI-1640 without phenol red, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin/
streptomycin (Life Technologies, Milan, Italy). Breast
tumor-derived endothelial cells (B-TEC) were obtained
from human breast carcinomas and characterized as
previously described [76]. B-TEC showed constant
expression of endothelial markers and increased
angiogenic properties, migration and drug resistance
in respect to normal microendothelial cells [76-78].

was mixed with two small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
specific for silencing MR or two siRNA controls (Origene,
distributed by Tema Ricerca, Milan, Italy) for 24 hours,
prior to treatments.

Gene expression studies

SkBr3 cells and B-TEC were processed according
to a previously described protocol [80-81] to obtain
protein lysate that was electrophoresed through a reducing
SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto
a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with primary
antibodies against MR (PA1594) (Boster Immunoleader,
distributed by Tema Ricerca, Milan, Italy), phosphorylated
ERK 1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), EGFR (1005), pEGFRTyr
1173
(sc-12351-R), GPER (N15), ERα (F10) and β-actin
(C2), all purchased from DBA (Milan, Italy). Proteins
were detected by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary
antibodies (DBA, Milan, Italy) and revealed using the
ECL System (GE Healthcare). Precision Plus Protein™
Dual Color Standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy)
was used to estimate molecular weights and then antigen
specificity.

Western blot analysis

Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures using
the TRIzol commercial kit (Life Technologies, Milan,
Italy) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA
was quantified spectrophotometrically and quality
was checked by electrophoresis through agarose gels
stained with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were
not degraded and showed clear 18 S and 28 S bands
under UV light were used for RT-PCR. Total cDNA
was synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription
using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(Life Technologies, Milan, Italy), following the protocol
provided by the manufacturer. The expression of selected
genes was quantified by real-time PCR using Step One
(TM)
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems
Inc, Milan, Italy), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Gene-specific primers were designed
using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied
Biosystems. Inc., Milan, Italy) and are as follows:
GPER Fwd: 5’-ACACACCTGGGTGGACACAA-3’
and Rev: 5’-GGAGCCAGAAGCCACATCTG-3’;
MR Fwd: 5’-GCTTTGATGGTAACTGTGAAGG-3’
and Rev: 5’- TGTGTTGCCCTTCCACTGCT-3’; ERα
Fwd: 5’-AGAGGGCATGGTGGAGATCTT-3’ and
Rev: 5’-CAAACTCCTCTCCCTGCAGATT-3’; NHE1 Fwd: 5’:- AAGGACCAGTTCATCATCGC-3’ and
Rev:5’TTCTTCACAGCCAACAGGTC-3’;
18S
Fwd: 5’-GGCGTCCCCCAACTTCTTA-3 and Rev:
5’-GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTATT-3’. Assays were
performed in triplicate and the RNA expression values
were normalized using 18S expression and then calculated
as fold induction.

Coimmunoprecipitation
After stimulation with 10 pM Aldo, SkBr3 breast
cancer cells were washed with PBS and lysed using 500
µl RIPA buffer with a mixture of protease inhibitors
containing 1.7 mg/ml aprotinin, 1mg/ml leupeptin, 200
mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mmol/
liter sodium orthovanadate, and 100 mmol/liter sodium
fluoride. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
10 min, and protein concentrations were determined using
Bradford reagent. Protein (250 µg) was then incubated for
2 hours with 900 µl of immunoprecipitation buffer with
inhibitors, 2 µg of GPER, MR or EGFR antibody and 20
µl of Protein A/G agarose immunoprecipitation reagent
(DBA, Milan, Italy). Samples were then centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4° C to pellet beads. Pellets were
washed four times with 500 µl of PBS and centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4° C. Supernatants were collected,
resuspended in 20 µl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors,
2X SDS sample buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl; 4% glycerol;
2% SDS) and β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 95° C
for 5 min. Samples were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE,
transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit antiGPER, rabbit anti-MR or rabbit anti-EGFR antibody.
Western blot analysis and ECL detection were performed
as described above.

Gene silencing experiments
For the silencing of GPER expression, cells were
plated onto 10-cm dishes and transfected using X-treme
GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics,
Milan, Italy) for 24 hours with two shRNA and two
different shGPER. The silencing of GPER expression
was obtained by using constructs which we have

indicated. To create a scratch of the cell monolayer, a p200
pipette tip was used. Cells were then washed twice with
PBS and treated. The migration assay was evaluated after
48 hours of treatment.

50 % confluent cultured SkBr3 cells and B-TEC
grown on coverslips were serum deprived and then treated
for 8 hours with 10 pM Aldo, as indicated. Where required,
cells previously transfected for 24 hours with shGPER or
siMR and respective control (as described above) and
then treated for 8 hours with 10 pM Aldo. Then cells were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2%
Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS and incubated
overnight with a goat primary antibody against NHE-1
(C20) (DBA, Milan, Italy). After incubation, the slides
were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI),
(1:1000), (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and donkey
anti-goat IgG-Rhodamine (1:100; purchased from DBA,
Milan, Italy). The slides were imaged on the Cytation 3
Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT)
and analysed using the software Gen5 (BioTek, Winooski,
VT).
For colocalization studies SkBr3 cells seeded on
chamber slides were serum deprived for 24 hours and
then treated for 15 min with 10 pM Aldo. Next, cells were
fixed, permeabilized and incubated overnight with antirabbit GPER (N15) and anti-mouse MR (H10E4C9F)
antibodies (DBA, Milan, Italy) alone and in combination.
Slides were then incubated with secondary antibodies
(donkey anti-rabbit IgG-Rhodamine, DBA, Milan, Italy)
and donkey anti-mouse IgG-Fitch (Alexa Fluor, Life
Technologies, Milan, Italy), stained by DAPI and then
imaged on the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader
(BioTek, Winooski, VT).

Time-lapse microscopy
SkBr3 cells and B-TEC (1 × 105) were seeded
in 24-well plates in regular growth medium until they
reached a 70% to 80% confluence. The culture wells were
then incubated in medium containing 2.5% charcoalstripped FBS, treated and transferred into a time-lapse
microscopy platform, equipped with a heated stage
chamber (Cytation™3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader,
Biotek, Winooski, VT). Cells were maintained at routine
incubation settings (37 °C, 5% CO2) using temperature
and gas controllers. To evaluate cell proliferation and
motility, the images were recorded using Cytation 3
Cell Imaging Multimode Reader and the software Gen5
(BioTek, Winooski, VT) in 10 min intervals for 24 hours
(cell proliferation) and 10 hours (cell motility). Then, the
images were processed as a movie using the software
Adobe Creative Cloud Premier Pro CC. Frames collected
every 10 minutes are displayed at a rate of 10 frames s-1.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA
followed by Newman-Keuls’ testing to determine
differences in means. p < 0.05 was considered as
statistically significant.
