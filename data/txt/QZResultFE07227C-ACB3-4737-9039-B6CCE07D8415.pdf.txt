Activator of Transcription 3–Dependent Pathway as a
Suppressive Negative Feedback on IFN-Induced Apoptosis

Abstract
The microRNA miR-21 is overexpressed in many human cancers, wherein accumulating evidence indicates that it functions as an oncogene. Here, we report that the cytokine IFN rapidly induces miR-21
expression in human and mouse cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was
implicated in this pathway based on the lack of IFN effect on miR-21 expression in prostate cancer cells
with a deletion in the STAT3 gene. STAT3 ablation abrogated IFN induction of miR-21, confirming the
important role of STAT3 in regulating miR-21. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that STAT3
directly bound the miR-21 promoter in response to IFN. Experiments in mouse embryo fibroblasts with a
genetic deletion of the p65 NF-κB subunit showed that IFN-induced miR-21 expression was also dependent
on NF-κB. STAT3 silencing blocked both IFN-induced p65 binding to the miR-21 promoter and p65 nuclear
translocation. Thus, IFN-induced miR-21 expression is coregulated by STAT3 and NF-κB at the level of the
miR-21 promoter. Several cell death regulators were identified as downstream targets of miR-21, including
PTEN and Akt. Functional experiments in prostate cancer cells directly showed that miR-21 plays a critical
role in suppressing IFN-induced apoptosis. Our results identify miR-21 as a novel IFN target gene that functions as a key feedback regulator of IFN-induced apoptosis. Cancer Res; 70(20); 8108–16. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
IFNs are antiviral cytokines that have significant effects
on cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the immune system. Binding of the type I IFNs (such as IFNα,
IFNβ, and IFNω) to their cognate cell surface receptor
leads to the activation of the receptor-associated Janusactivated kinase 1 (JAK1) and TYK2 tyrosine kinases. This
process results in the recruitment, tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins
(1, 2). In the classic JAK-STAT signaling pathway, STAT1
and STAT2, in a complex with IRF9, bind to the conserved
IFN stimulus response element within the promoters of
the early response IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), thereby inducing their expression. However, a number of studies
have implicated a role for STAT3 in IFNα/β action (3–
7). STAT3, which was originally identified as the transcripAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1 Pathology and Laboratory

tion factor for acute phase response genes, is activated by
a wide variety of cytokines suggesting that STAT3 may
integrate diverse signals into common transcriptional
responses (5, 8, 9).
Besides inducing ISG expression, IFNs have been found to
regulate the expression of microRNAs (miRNA), which may
play a role in IFN-induced antiviral activity (10). miRNAs are
an abundant class of small RNAs that control gene expression
at the posttranscriptional level through mRNA degradation or
repression of mRNA translation. miRNAs are able to regulate
the expression of multiple targets by binding to the 3′ untranslated regions of genes. Emerging evidence suggests that
miRNAs are involved in many critical biological processes,
including development, differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, and antiviral defense. The ability of IFN to induce apoptosis is somewhat paradoxical, because IFN induces the apoptosis
of certain cancer cells but in other cells IFN induces a potent
cell survival pathway.
Because STAT3 has also been implicated in IFN action,
we examined the promoters of known miRNAs and identified a potential STAT3 binding site in the miR-21 promoter. Expression of miR-21 seems to be upregulated in
various human cancers (glioblastoma, breast cancer, and
prostate cancer) and is upregulated by interleukin (IL)-6
and Toll receptor signaling (11, 12). In this report, we examined whether IFN regulates miR-21 expression and the
potential role of STAT3 in its regulation. We found that
IFN upregulated miR-21 expression in a variety of cells.
Of particular interest was our finding that IFN induced

IFN Induction of miR-21 Suppresses Apoptosis

miR-21 expression in DU145 prostate cancer cells, but not
in PC3 prostate cancer cells that have a genetic deletion of
the STAT3 gene. STAT3 knockdown of DU145 cells abrogated IFN induction of miR-21 and provided supportive evidence that STAT3 may regulate miR-21. Direct binding of
STAT3 to the miR-21 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Moreover, IFN-induced
miR-21 expression was dependent on the p65 subunit of
NF-κB, which also bound to the miR-21 promoter. A number of downstream targets for miR-21 were also identified,
including STAT3 expression itself. Thus, STAT3 regulates
IFN-induced miR-21 expression, and in a positive feedback
loop, miR-21 expression upregulates STAT3 expression. In
addition, we found that miR-21 regulated IFN-induced apoptosis. Whereas IFN-induced apoptosis was inhibited by
miR-21 overexpression, miR-21 knockdown enhanced IFNinduced apoptosis. These results identify miR-21 as an IFN
target gene and place miR-21 as an important regulator of
IFN-induced apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Biological reagents and cell culture
Recombinant human IFNα (IFNαCon1) and murine IFNβ
were provided by InterMune and Biogen-Idec, Inc., respectively. The biological activity of the IFN preparations was expressed in terms of international reference units per milliliter
using the appropriate NIH reference standard as described
previously (3). Human PC3 and DU145 cells (obtained from
American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI
1640 with 10% bovine calf serum. Cells were maintained in
the presence of penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin
(100 mg/mL) at 37°C with 5% CO2. The cell lines were not
authenticated in our laboratory.
Detection of miRNA expression using poly(A) tailing
SYBR Green real-time PCR
Total RNA (5 μg) was treated with DNase I for 15 minutes at 22°C (Invitrogen) and then poly(A) tailed using poly
(A) polymerase (NEB) at 37°C for 1 hour. The final reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol, and redissolved in 25 μL of
diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Poly(A)-tailed RNA
(6 μL) was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using
Superscript III transcriptase (Invitrogen) with the oligodT adapter primer 5′-GCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTTTTTTTTTTTVN-3′. For PCR, 30 ng of
cDNA were used as a template in each reaction. The reverse
primer was from the adapter sequence 5′-GCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGACTCAC-3′, and the forward primers were
specific to miR-21 mature sequences. U6 small noncoding
RNA sequence was amplified as an internal control using
the primers 5′-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3′ (forward) and
5′-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3′ (reverse). The SYBR
Green–based real-time PCR was performed using MyiQ
Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The relative
expression of miRNA was calculated based on the formula:
2-(∆CtmiR-21-∆CtU6).

Construction of lentivirus to overexpress miR-21 or
knock down miR-21
To overexpress the miR-21 gene, we amplified a fragment
from mouse genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CGCTCTAGATCGTGGTCGTGACATCGCATG (forward) and 5′GCGGATCCGGATGGTCAGATGAAAGATACC (reverse),
which contain pre-miR-21 gene with 160 bp upstream and
65 bp downstream flanking sequence, then inserted it into
XbaI and BamHI sites of the pLenti-pgk-puro lentiviral vector
obtained from the viral vector core (VVC) of University of
Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC). To knock down
miR-21 expression, oligonucleotides (CGCTCTAGATCAACATCAGTCTGATAAGCTA, forward and GCGGATCCTAGCTTATCAGACTGATCTTGA, reverse) against the
mature sequence of miR-21 gene were annealed and cloned
into XbaI and BamHI site of lentiviral vector pLenti-U6-pgkpuro (VVC, UTHSC), resulting in the antisense miR-21 gene
being driven by polymerase III promoter U6. Lentivirus was
produced in 293FT cells by cotransfection of the lentiviral
vectors with ViraPower Packaging Mix (Invitrogen). The supernatant was collected at 60 hours posttransfection and
was centrifuged (3,000 × g for 15 minutes at 4°C) to remove cell
debris; then the supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm
filter, and the virus was collected by ultracentrifugation
(50,000 × g for 3 hours at 4°C). The pellet was dissolved in
PBS and frozen at −80°C. Lentiviral particles were titrated in
293FT cells with a p24 ELISA assay (Perkin-Elmer).
Knockdown of STAT3 using short hairpin RNA–miR
To knock down the human STAT3 gene, we purchased
STAT3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–miR lentiviral vector
pGIPZ, which contains a human miR-30 hairpin–based
shRNA-miR structure against STAT3 (OPEN Biosystems).
The target sequence of STAT3 used is AAACGGAAGCTGCAGAAAGATA.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out
using the ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, chromatin
from cells was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (10 minutes
at 22°C), sheared to an average size of ∼500 bp and then
immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 or STAT3 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The ChIP-PCR primers were designed to
amplify a proximal promoter region containing putative binding sites in the miR-21 promoter identified by TFSEARCH.
Immunoblot analysis
Total cell lysates (25 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE,
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, followed by IRDye800CW goat anti-mouse IgG or IRDye680 goat
anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR Biosciences). Blots were visualized on
an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).
Apoptosis assay
The induction of apoptosis was monitored by DNA fragmentation using the cell death detection ELISAPLUS or by

variety of normal and cancer cell lines of different origins
(prostate cancer, glioma, melanoma, and fibroblasts) were
treated with IFNα (1,000 IU/mL for 6 hours), total RNA
was isolated, and miR-21 expression was determined by

quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). As shown in Fig. 1A,
although basal miR-21 expression markedly varied among
the different cell lines, IFN consistently induced a 3-fold
to 5-fold increase in miR-21 expression. The notable exception was the failure of IFN to upregulate miR-21 in
PC3 prostate cancer cells that lack the STAT3 gene
(13). We next examined the dose dependence and time
course of IFN-induced miR-21 expression in DU145 cells
and found that IFN-induced miR-21 at IFN concentrations
of >10 IU/mL with near maximal induction observed at
100 IU/mL (Fig. 1B). Moreover, IFN induced miR-21 expression within 2 hours after IFN addition (1000 IU/mL),
and miR-21 levels peaked between 6 and 24 hours after
IFN addition and remained elevated at 48 hours after
IFN addition. It is of interest that the dose dependence
and time course of IFN induction of miR-21 expression
were similar to what is observed for ISG15 (Fig. 1C).
These data indicate that IFNs induce miR-21 expression
in a variety of human cell lines and that the kinetics
and dose dependence of induction are similar to those
of a “classic” ISG.

The roles of STAT3 and NF-κB in IFN-induced
miR-21 expression
Because IFN induced miR-21 in a variety of cell lines but
not in STAT3-deficient PC3 cells, we next examined whether STAT3 was involved in IFN-induced miR-21 expression.
Activation of STAT3 involves the phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 within its transactivation domain, which is required for STAT dimerization, nuclear translocation, and
induction of gene transcription. Expression of a mutant
form of STAT3 with the canonical Y705 phosphorylation
site mutated to phenylalanine has dominant-negative properties (DN-STAT3; ref. 14). IFN induces STAT3 activation in
DU145 cells, whereas PC3 cells lack STAT3 (Supplementary
Fig. S1). DU145 cells were transfected with DN-STAT3 and
stable pools were isolated and examined for IFN induction
of miR-21 expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, IFN induced
miR-21 expression in DU145 cells transfected with empty
vector (EV) consistent with the results presented in Fig. 1.
However, IFN did not induce miR-21 expression in DU145
cells transfected with DN-STAT3. Moreover, expression of
DN-STAT3 in DU145 cells also reduced the basal expression

of miR-21. As a complementary approach, DU145 cells were
transduced with a lentivirus-delivered shRNA against
STAT3. shRNA knocked down STAT3 protein levels in
DU145 cells by ∼80% (Supplementary Fig. S2) and, most
importantly, nearly completely ablated IFN-induced miR21 expression (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in cells transduced
with control shRNA, IFN induced miR-21. Taken together,
these results suggest that STAT3 regulates IFN-induced
miR-21 expression.
Because we previously showed that there was crosstalk between STAT3 and NF-κB in the IFN activation
pathway (4, 6) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
miR-21 expression was found to be dependent on the
p65 NF-κB protein (15), we next examined whether
IFN-induced miR-21 was also dependent on p65. IFN induced miR-21 in wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts
(MEF), but not in MEFs derived from p65 knockout mice
(Fig. 2C). The induction of miR-21 by LPS was also
markedly reduced in p65 knockout MEFs compared with
wild-type MEFs, as reported previously (15). Moreover,
we found that two other IFN-induced miRs, miR-296
and miR-351 (10), differed in their p65 dependence
(Fig. 2D). Whereas IFN induction of miR-296 was clearly
p65 dependent, induction of miR-351 was independent of
p65. It is of interest that we previously showed, using
p65 knockout MEFs, that the NF-κB–mediated repression
of some ISGs, such as mx1 and nmi, was also p65 dependent (16). These results showed that both the p65
NF-κB protein and STAT3 play important roles in regulating IFN-induced miR-21 expression.

Binding of STAT3 and the p65 NF-κB subunit to the
miR-21 promoter
Because p65 and STAT3 seem to be required for IFN
induction of miR-21 expression, we next examined whether
they directly bind to the miR-21 promoter. Examination of
putative transcription binding sites by TFSEARCH (http://
www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) revealed three
STAT3 binding sites (hereafter called STAT3-I, STAT3-II,
and STAT3-III) and four NF-κB binding sites in the miR21 promoter (Supplementary Fig. S3). Specific primers were
designed and synthesized for each potential binding site in
the miR-21, and the binding of STAT3 and p65 to these
putative sites was shown by ChIP analysis. In brief,
DU145 cells were treated with IFNα (1,000 IU/mL for
1 hour), protein-DNA complexes cross-linked with formaldehyde, chromatin was sheared to an average of 500 bp
and immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT3 or anti-p65,
and cross-linking reversed and the resulting DNA sequences were detected by PCR and qPCR. As shown in
Fig. 3A, IFN induced significant binding to the distal
STAT3-I binding site (∼3.4 kB from the start site of the
miR-21 precursor). This STAT3 binding site was previously
identified by ChIP analysis in the upregulation of miR-21
by IL-6 (12). In contrast, IFN did not induce significant
STAT3 binding to the other putative STAT3 binding sites
in the miR-21 promoter. Taken together, these results show
that STAT3 regulates miR-21 expression in IFN-treated DU145
cells by directly binding to the miR-21 promoter. This led us to
examine whether p65 bound to the NF-κB binding site that
was nearby the STAT3-I site in the miR-21 promoter. As

shown in Fig. 3B, in DU145 cells, IFN induced p65 binding
to this NF-κB site in the miR-21 promoter. Most interestingly, STAT3 knockdown completely ablated NF-κB binding.
Moreover, STAT3 knockdown also blocked the IFN-induced
translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB into the nucleus
(Fig. 3C). These results, taken together, suggest that p65
nuclear translocation and binding to the miR-21 promoter
are both STAT3 dependent.
miR-21 expression suppresses IFN-induced apoptosis
Previous studies indicate that miR-21 may regulate apoptosis. Although IFN induces apoptosis in some cancer cell
lines, this action seems to be counterbalanced by the induction of a potent cell survival pathway, which is NF-κB dependent. We next examined whether IFN induced apoptosis
in DU145 or PC3 cells. Cells were treated with IFN (1,000
IU/mL for 24 hours), and apoptosis was measured by a

cell-death detection ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4, whereas
IFN induced marked apoptosis in PC3 cells, little apoptosis
in DU145 cells was observed on IFN addition. Because IFNinduced miR-21 expression in DU145 but not in PC3 cells,
we hypothesized that miR-21 expression might suppress
IFN-induced apoptosis. Therefore, PC3 cells were transduced with miR-21, and stable cell lines were isolated with
miR-21 expression levels comparable with DU145 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We then compared PC3 cells overexpressing miR-21 to EV-expressing PC3 cells for IFNinduced apoptosis and found that miR-21 expression
completely blocked IFN-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells as
measured by a cell death detection ELISA assay and by
TUNEL staining (Fig. 4). These results suggest that miR-21
expression suppresses IFN-induced apoptosis. We then used
a complementary approach to knock down miR-21 expression in DU145 cells by ∼85% (Supplementary Fig. S4) and

examined the effect on apoptosis induced by IFN. As shown
in Fig. 4B, whereas IFN did not promote significant apoptosis in EV-expressing DU145 cells, IFN induced apoptosis in
anti-miR-21–expressing DU145 cells. These results, taken together, suggest that miR-21 plays an important role in suppressing IFN-induced apoptosis.
We next examined whether miR-21 plays a role in suppressing apoptosis induced by other inducers of apoptosis, camptothecin and staurosporine. As shown in Fig. 4B, miR-21
overexpression in PC-3 cells suppresses apoptosis induced
by camptothecin and staurosporine also. Moreover, miR-21
knockdown in DU145 cells enhances apoptosis induced by
camptothecin and staurosporine. These results taken together suggest that induction of miR-21 by IFN is protective
against apoptosis induced by a variety of anticancer agents
(IFN, camptothecin, and staurosporine).
The effect of miR-21 on potential gene targets
Individual miRNA targets genes by regulating their expression at both transcriptional and posttranscription levels. Several studies have identified a number of target genes for
miR-21. Because we have shown that miR-21 suppressed
IFN-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells, we examined the effect
of miR-21 on possible antiapoptotic effectors in PC3 cells. Activation of the Akt pathway in a variety of cells contributes to
cell survival. In addition, we previously showed that Akt activation was critical in the antiapoptotic pathway induced by IFN
(17). As shown in Fig. 5A, IFN induced Akt activation in PC3
cells expressing miR-21 but not in control vector–transduced
PC3 cells. IFN activated Akt within 30 minutes of addition,
and Akt activity nearly peaked at 2 hours and remained activated 48 hours after IFN addition. In contrast, IFN did not
result in Akt activation in EV-transduced PC3 cells. Moreover, Akt activation was not due to an IFN-induced increase
in cellular Akt levels, as the levels remained relatively stable
throughout the time course of IFN addition. The rapid activation of Akt is similar to what we previously reported in
Daudi B-lymphoblastoid cells, in which IFN induced a potent
cell survival pathway that was dependent on phosphoinosi-

tide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt (17). Therefore, we next examined
whether miR-21 or IFN affected the expression of the p85 subunit
of PI3K. As shown in Fig. 5B, IFN-induced a time-dependent increaseinp85 levels incontrol vectorPC3 cells,but miR-21expression resulted ina dramatic increase in basal p85 levels, which was
further increased by IFN addition. Thus, these results identify the
p85 subunit of PI3K, which is an upstream regulator of Akt activation (18), as a miR-21 target.
Previous studies have shown that miR-21 upregulates
STAT3 expression (19) and downregulates PTEN expression
(20). For these studies we compared expression levels of a
number of potential miR-21 targets in DU145 cells and
DU145 cells with miR-21 knockdown, because PC3 cells do
not express STAT3 and PTEN (Supplementary Fig. S5). As
shown in Fig. 5C, STAT3 is downregulated by miR-21 knockdown. Moreover, IFN-induced STAT3 activation is similarly
downregulated by miR-21 knockdown. In contrast, STAT1 levels are unaffected by miR-21 expression. Moreover, PTEN is
upregulated in miR-21 knockdown cells, suggesting that
PTEN is a target of miR-21 in DU145 cells. In contrast
PDCD4, another known target of miR-21 (15), was unaffected
by miR-21 knockdown, suggesting that the effects of miR-21
are cell context dependent.

Discussion
By expression profiling of miRNAs that are dysregulated in
human cancers, miR-21 was found to be overexpressed in diverse forms of cancer including glioma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, stomach and gastric cancer, lung cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer (21). Similar
to these findings, we found that relative to expression in human fibroblasts, basal expression was higher in various cancer cell lines studied (e.g., glioma, prostate, and melanoma).
Most importantly, we found that, irrespective of basal expression, IFN induced miR-21 expression. A recent study reported
that IFN reduced miR-21 expression in human gliomas (22),
which is in conflict with our findings. However, we cannot
exclude cell type–specific differences in the effects of IFN

IFN Induction of miR-21 Suppresses Apoptosis

on miR-21 expression. Several studies have established that
miR-21 is induced by various stimuli. For example, Toll ligand receptor activation by LPS upregulates miR-21 in many
cells types, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (15). Moreover, IL-6 promotes the
survival of multiple myeloma cells through the induction of
miR-21 expression (12). In the present study, we show that, in
common with ISG induction, miR-21 is induced within several
hours after IFN exposure, and induction is clearly dose dependent. Thus, miR-21 is an IFN target gene in multiple cell types.
The finding that IFN induced miR-21 expression in the
DU145 prostate cancer cells but not in PC-3 cells, which
have a genetic deletion of the STAT3 locus (13), provided
suggestive evidence that STAT3 may regulate miR-21 expression. Expression of a dominant negative STAT3 construct (F705-STAT3) or knockdown of STAT3 expression
in DU145 cells ablated IFN-induced miR-21 expression,
which showed that STAT3 plays an important role in
IFN-induced miR-21 expression. ChIP analysis on putative
STAT3 binding sites in the miR-21 promoter showed that
IFN induced STAT3 binding to the most distal STAT3
binding site but had no effect on the two other putative
STAT3 binding sites. Previous studies found that IL-6 induced STAT3 binding to this same STAT3 site in the
miR-21 promoter (12). Furthermore, a reporter construct
containing this same STAT3 binding site was shown to
be IL-6 responsive. Taken together, these results show that
the IFN induction of miR-21 is STAT3 dependent.
In addition, the miR-21 promoter has four putative NF-κB
binding sites. Therefore, we examined the induction of miR-21
by IFN in MEFs deficient in the p65 subunit and found that
IFN induction of miR-21 was also dependent on p65. Moreover, we found that IFN induction of a known IFN-induced
miR, miR-296, was also p65 dependent. Therefore, we next examined the direct binding of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to the
miR-21 promoter by ChIP analysis. IFN induced p65 binding
to the upstream region of miR-21 that was nearby the STAT3
site to which IFN induced binding. Most interestingly, STAT3
knockdown ablated IFN-induced p65 binding to this NF-κB
binding site, as well as p65 nuclear translocation. These results suggest that IFN induces STAT3 and the p65 subunit
of NF-κB subunit to simultaneously bind to mIR-21 promoter,
which is of particular interest, because we previously reported
crosstalk between IFN-induced STAT3 and NF-κB signaling
pathways (4, 6). Moreover, our recent studies suggest that
STAT3 plays a critical role in forming a complex with p65 in
the cytoplasm that subsequently translocates into the nucleus
to regulate gene expression.4 Constitutive activation of STAT3
and NF-κB signaling has long been associated with cancer and
inflammation. Therefore, it is highly interesting that miR-21
upregulation has also recently been found in various cancers
(23) as well as inflammatory conditions, including osteoarthritis (24), psoriasis (25), ulcerative colitis (26), and cardiac
hypertrophy (27).

Because miR-21 is involved in the control of tumor cell apoptosis (28, 29), we reasoned that miR-21 might contribute to
the regulation of IFN-induced apoptosis. We found that,
whereas IFN induced significant apoptosis in PC3 cells, little
IFN-induced apoptosis was observed in DU145 cells, which
was inversely correlated with the IFN-induced expression of
miR-21 (i.e., IFN induced miR-21 in DU145 cells but not in
PC3 cells). Ectopic overexpression of miR-21 in PC3 cells completely blocked IFN-induced apoptosis, whereas miR-21
knockdown in DU145 cells sensitized these cells to IFNinduced apoptosis. Moreover, the suppressive effect of miR21 on apoptosis was also evident for other apoptosis inducers
(camptothecin and staurosporine). These results are in agreement with the previous studies that miR-21 knockdown in
glioblastoma cells enhances apoptosis (28). One major limitation of IFN as an effective therapy in cancer is its inability to
efficiently induce the apoptosis in cancer cells. We propose
that the upregulation of miR-21 in various cancers may be a
cause of the intrinsic resistance of these cancers to IFNinduced cell death. Thus, manipulation of miR-21 expression
may be a possible means to improve the efficacy of IFN, alone
or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, as a
treatment for prostate cancer.
Because high miR-21 expression was linked to suppression
of apoptosis, we examined various proteins that have been
previously associated with the induction of an antiapoptotic
pathway by IFN. STAT3 has been shown to regulate apoptosis in various cell lines. Elevated STAT3 activity has been
shown to render cells resistant to apoptosis by inducing antiapoptotic genes such as BCL2, BCL-xL, and Mcl-1 (30). In contrast, inhibition of STAT3 activation by knockdown or
expression of dominant negative STAT3 constructs has been
shown to sensitize cells to apoptosis (31). Thus, it is of interest that miR-21 expression was found to upregulate STAT3
expression. These results are also consistent with our previous studies that place STAT3 as an important component of
a PI3K/Akt-dependent IFN-induced cell survival pathway (3,
4). It is of particular interest that miR-21 targeted Akt activation but not Akt protein levels, which is consistent with our
previous finding that IFN-induced Akt activation was critical
to an NF-κB–dependent cell survival pathway (17). Moreover,
we found that miR-21 also targets PTEN, which is also dependent on STAT3. Thus, our evidence indicates that miR-21
downregulates PTEN levels through a STAT3-dependent pathway and results in enhanced Akt activity. However, it is important to note that in PC3 cells, which lack PTEN (32), IFN resulted
in Akt activation through a miR-21–dependent pathway. Therefore, our results suggest that miR-21 may also activate Akt
through a PTEN-independent pathway that involves the upregulation of the p85 subunit of PI3K.
In conclusion, we have found that IFN induced miR-21 expression through a pathway that involves both STAT3 and NFκB. Most interesting is that miR-21 suppresses IFN-induced
apoptosis through upregulating the levels of p85, STAT3,
and Akt activity. This is the first report that the oncomir
miR-21 can be upregulated by IFN and that manipulation of
miR-21 expression by miR-21 knockdown can be used to enhance the apoptotic action of IFN. This finding adds a new
