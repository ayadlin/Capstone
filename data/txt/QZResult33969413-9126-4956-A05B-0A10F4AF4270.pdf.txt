ABSTRACT:
T-oligo, an 11-base oligonucleotide homologous to the 3’-telomeric overhang,
is a novel, potent therapeutic modality in melanoma and multiple other tumor types.
T-oligo is proposed to function in a manner similar to experimental disruption of
the telomere overhang and induces DNA damage responses including apoptosis,
differentiation and senescence. However, important components involved in T-oligo
induced responses are not defined, particularly the role of p53, TRF1 and TRF2 in
mediating the T-oligo induced responses. In MU, PM-WK, and MM-MC melanoma
cells, exposure to T-oligo upregulates p53 expression and phosphorylation, resulting
in cellular differentiation and activation of a caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade.
However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 completely blocks T-oligo induced
differentiation and significantly decreases apoptosis, suggesting that p53 is an
important mediator of T-oligo induced responses. In addition, we characterized the
roles of telomere binding proteins, TRF1, TRF2, and tankyrase-1, in T-oligo induced
damage responses. We demonstrate that tankyrase-1 activity is required for initiation
of T-oligo induced damage responses including p53 phosphorylation and reduction
of cellular proliferation. These results highlight TRF1, TRF2, tankyrase-1 and p53
as important elements in T-oligo mediated responses and suggest new avenues for
research into T-oligo’s mechanism of action.

INTRODUCTION

Telomeres are composed of tandem nucleotide
repeats (TTAGGG) at the end of chromosomes [1] that
form a protective T-loop at the single-stranded 3′ end.
The T-loop caps and protects the telomere end through
recruitment of the shelterin complex, composed of
telomeric repeat binding factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and
TRF2), POT1, TIN1, TPP1 and RAP1 [6]. TRF1 and
TRF2 directly bind the duplex DNA region of T-loops
and function as negative regulators of telomere length
by preserving loop structure integrity and preventing
telomerase access to the telomere [7-9]. Expression
of dominant negative TRF2 induces uncapping of the
telomere overhang and initiates DNA damage responses,
possibly by disruption of the T-loop and exposure of the
telomere overhang, a process mediated in part through
ATM and its effector protein p53 [5, 10]. Conversely,
overexpression of TRF2 in telomerase negative cells

Telomeres and telomerase are areas of active
research in tumor biology. Telomeres are structures that
serve protective roles by allowing cells to distinguish
chromosome ends from damaged DNA [1]. Disruption
of the telomere results in multiple adverse consequences
including potent DNA damage responses, chromosome
fusion via non-homologous end joining, and genome
instability [1]. Therefore, targeted disruption of the
telomere or telomerase is an attractive therapeutic option
[2]. Consequently, administration of T-oligo, an 11-base
oligonucleotide homologous to the 3′ telomeric overhang,
has been proposed as both a cancer therapeutic [3], and
a method to study DNA damage responses induced by
disruption of the telomere [4, 5].

leads to an increased rate of telomere shortening and
less efficient repair of single-stranded breaks (SSBs) in
telomeric DNA [11]. TRF1 functions in a similar manner
by binding telomeric DNA and stabilizing the shelterin
complex [6]. Both TRF1 and TRF2 are thought to be key
mediators of T-loop integrity and their disruption could
lead to downstream DNA damage responses.
Tankyrase-1, a telomere-specific poly(ADPribosyl) polymerase (PARP), acts as an inhibitor of TRF1
by catalyzing the addition of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR)
groups to TRF1 and preventing it from binding telomeric
DNA [12]. Overexpression of tankyrase-1 leads to
telomerase binding and telomere elongation in telomerase
positive cells [13], presumably as a consequence of TRF1
inhibition [14, 15]. Consistent with this data, inhibition of
tankyrase-1 induces telomere shortening in the presence
of telomerase, and thus its inhibition has emerged as a
prospective cancer therapy [16]. Tankyrase-1 inhibitors,
XAV939 and 3-aminobenzamide (3AB), block telomerase
from accessing telomeric DNA [13], presumably by
preventing PARsylation of TRF1 [12] and cause a
downstream DNA damage response [17, 18].
T-oligo has been proposed as a means for studying
downstream DNA damage responses caused by exposure
of the telomere overhang. T-oligo induces potent DNA
damage responses [4, 19] including transient cell cycle
arrest, adaptive differentiation, replicative senescence
and apoptosis [3, 4, 20, 21]. T-oligo accumulates in the
nucleus and initiates downstream signaling through p95/
Nbs1, p16, pRb, p53, p73 and p21 [3, 4, 20-22]. However,
induction of DNA damage responses by T-oligo does not
require damaged telomeric DNA [19], and T-oligo may
lead to an increase in mean telomere length [4]. Further,
T-oligo has been proposed as a cancer therapeutic because
it induces apoptosis and differentiation and specifically
targets malignant cells [3, 5, 23].
At present, it is unclear how introduction of T-oligo
into the cell results in a downstream DNA damage
response. T-oligo may function as a “replacement” signal
in place of telomeric DNA obscured by overexpressed
telomerase [5]. We propose that T-oligo initiates a DNA
damage response through recruitment of telomeric
structures away from the telomere with subsequent
exposure of the telomere overhang. To investigate the
connection between telomere exposure and T-oligoinduced DNA damage responses, we utilized tankyrase-1
inhibitors, XAV939 and 3AB, to prevent tankyrase-1
mediated dissociation of TRF1 from telomeric DNA.
This would, in effect, prevent dissociation of the shelterin
complex and disruption of the telomere overhang which,
under normal circumstances, induces a DNA damage
response [6]. We then exposed cells to T-oligo to
determine if tankyrase-1-mediated dissociation of TRF1
from the telomere is required for T-oligo to elicit a DNA
damage response.
Further, the exact signaling pathways through which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DNA damage responses, mediated by T-oligo, proceed are
still undefined. p53, a DNA damage response mediator,
has been proposed to play an important role in T-oligo
induced DNA damage responses as it is upregulated and
phosphorylated in response to T-oligo [5]. However the
role of p53 in T-oligo-mediated anticancer responses
in melanoma has not been demonstrated. Thus, we
investigated the downstream effects of T-oligo, including
differentiation and the apoptotic caspase cascade, before
and after siRNA mediated p53 knockdown, in p53
expressing MU, PM-WK, and MM-MC melanoma cells.
In this study, we improve our understanding of
the DNA damage pathways induced by T-oligo through
an examination of the role of p53 in apoptosis and
differentiation in melanoma cells. Further, we examine the
role of the telomere binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2,
and also delineate the requirement of tankyrase-1 activity
for T-oligo’s downstream effects.

RESULTS
Treatment with T-oligo induces p53 expression
and phosphorylation in melanoma cells.
Exposure of the telomere overhang induces a strong
DNA damage response in malignant cells including
apoptosis and differentiation [3-5]. T-oligo induced DNA
damage responses are believed to progress through ATM,
p53, E2F1 and p95/NBS1 [3, 5, 19, 24], however, the roles
of ATM and p53 are unclear [4, 22]. To define the role
of p53 in melanoma cells, we exposed p53-expressing
MU, MM-MC and PM-WK melanoma cells to T-oligo for
various time points and then performed immunoblotting.
In MU cells, T-oligo increases E2F1, a driver of p53
expression [25, 26], after 24 hrs of exposure in addition
to upregulation of p53 expression and phosphorylation
after 24 and 48 hrs of exposure (Fig 1A). T-oligo also
upregulates p21, a transcriptional target of p53 [27], after
24 and 48 hrs of exposure in MU melanoma cells (Fig 1A).
PM-WK cells exhibit a similar response with increased
E2F1 after 24 hrs of exposure to T-oligo and upregulation
of p53 expression and its phosphorylation at 48 hrs of
exposure (Fig 1B). A similar response is demonstrated in
MM-MC cells with significant upregulation of E2F1 after
24 hrs and p53 phosphorylation after 48 hrs of exposure to
T-oligo (Fig 1C). These results suggest an integral role of
p53 in T-oligo induced DNA damage responses.

Exposure to T-oligo induces a caspase cascade
Studies in our laboratory and others show that
T-oligo selectively induces apoptosis in multiple types of
malignant cells including melanoma, prostate, NSCLC,
ovarian and breast [3-5, 22, 23, 28-30]. However, few

insights are available into the involvement of an apoptotic
cascade in T-oligo induced apoptosis in melanoma. To
further define and understand the caspases induced by
T-oligo in p53-expressing melanoma cells, we analyzed
MU and PM-WK melanoma cells for induction of a
caspase cascade. In PM-WK cells, survivin, an inhibitor
of apoptosis that is overexpressed in melanoma and blocks
activation of caspase-9 [31, 32], is downregulated after
72 hrs of exposure to T-oligo (Fig 2A), with subsequent
decrease of the caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-7
proenzymes after 96 hrs of treatment with T-oligo (Fig
2B). In addition, MU cells also exhibit a decrease in
caspase-3 and caspase-7 proenzymes after 96 hrs of
exposure to T-oligo (Fig 2C). To validate and quantify
caspase-3 activation and activity, we measured caspase-3
catalytic activity using the colorimetric CaspACE assay.
In MU cells, increased caspase-3 activity is observed after
both 72 and 96 hrs of treatment with T-oligo (Fig 2D).
These results establish involvement of the caspase cascade
in T-oligo induced apoptosis in melanoma.

Although much attention is given to T-oligo induced
apoptosis, the development of metastatic melanoma is
often coupled with a loss of melanocyte differentiationspecific antigens [33] that are utilized in immunotherapymediated treatment of melanoma [34]. Previous studies
identify an important link between exposure of the
telomere overhang with differentiation in melanoma
[35-37], and we suggest that T-oligo could also mediate
differentiation of melanoma cells [3]. Additionally,
differentiation of melanoma cells is associated with
slowed growth and reduced tumorigenicity [36, 37] and is
the target of melanoma vaccine therapy [34].
Currently, it is unclear if treatment with T-oligo
can cause uniform differentiation across all melanoma
cell types. To determine the extent of T-oligo induced
differentiation, MU, PM-WK and MM-MC melanoma
cells were exposed to T-oligo and subsequently

melanoma cells were treated with 40 μM of T-oligo (T), complementary oligo (C) or an equal volume of diluent (D) for 24-48 hrs and
subsequently prepared for immunoblotting. (A) MU cells demonstrate upregulation of p53 at 24 hrs (1.5-fold) and 48 hrs (2-fold) with
corresponding increase in phosphorylation of p53 (ser15) of 18-fold and 25-fold at 24 and 48 hrs, respectively. Further, p21, a downstream
transcription product of p53, is increased 2.5-fold and 5-fold in MU cells at 24 and 48hrs, respectively. E2F1 expression is also increased
by 2.5-fold at 24 hrs. (B) T-oligo induces a similar increase in p53 and phospho-p53 (ser15) by 1.5-fold and 4.8-fold respectively at 48
hrs in PM-WK cells, with an increase in E2F1 expression by 1.5-fold at 24 hrs in PM-WK cells. (C) MM-MC also exhibit upregulation of
E2F1 (3.5-fold) after 24hrs of exposure to T-oligo along with a significant 17-fold increase in p53 phosphorylation after 48 hrs of exposure
to T-oligo. Experiments were performed in triplicate with representative results displayed.

immunoblotted for expression of the melanoma
differentiation proteins MART-1, TRP-1, TRP-2, and
tyrosinase. MU melanoma cells exposed to T-oligo
express MART-1 after 24 hrs (Fig 3A) with additional
expression of TRP-1 (Fig 3B), tyrosinase and TRP-2 after
96 hrs (Fig 3C). Interestingly, PM-WK cells express only
tyrosinase after 48 hrs of exposure to T-oligo (Fig 3D),
while tyrosinase and TRP-2 are increased in MM-MC
cells over the entire course of 72 hrs of exposure to T-oligo
(Fig 3E). These results provide compelling evidence for
strong and progressive T-oligo-induced differentiation in
p53-expressing melanoma.

transfection, respectively (Fig 4A). MU cells treated with
siRNA against cells were then exposed to T-oligo for 72
hrs and subsequently stained with propidium iodide and
analyzed by FACS analysis for apoptosis. Loss of p53
decreased T-oligo induced apoptosis by 45% (Fig 4C),
indicating that it has a substantial, although perhaps not
exclusive, role in apoptosis. Additionally, p53 knockdown
eliminated the T-oligo-induced expression of tyrosinase
and TRP-1 (Fig 4B). This data suggests that p53 plays a
vital role in T-oligo-induced apoptosis and differentiation
in melanoma.

DNA damage responses.

Loss of T-oligo induced differentiation and
apoptosis after p53 knockdown.

Although the T-oligo induced DNA damage
responses are well established [3-5, 19-21, 29], the
initiating events that lead to T-oligo induced DNA damage
responses are not defined. T-oligo is proposed to function
in a manner similar to exposure of the telomere overhang
[5] as T-oligo induced DNA damage responses are similar
to the effects of TRF2 disruption [5, 19]. TRF1 functions
in similar manner as TRF2 by mediating the association
of the shelterin complex with the telomere [6] and is
PARsylated by tankyrase-1 which leads to its dissociation
from the telomere [12], exposure of the telomere

While p53 is proposed to be a primary mediator
of T-oligo-induced DNA damage responses in breast
cancer [5], the role of p53 in melanoma is unclear as
p53-deficient MM-AN cells undergo apoptosis after
upregulation of p73 [4]. To demonstrate a definitive role
for p53 in melanoma differentiation and apoptosis in
response to T-oligo exposure, MU cells were transfected
with either anti-p53 siRNA or control siRNA for 12
hrs. Knockdown of p53 expression was confirmed by a
10- and 2.2-fold downregulation at 72 and 96 hrs after

oligo (C) or an equal volume of diluent (D) for indicated times and cell lysates were immunoblotted for detection of survivin and caspase
proenzymes. (A) T-oligo treatment in PM-WK caused downregulation in survivin (1.5-fold) (B) followed by a 9.3, 2.9, and 1.5-fold decrease
in caspase-3, 7, and 9 proenzymes respectively, at 96 hrs of incubation with T-oligo as compared to the complimentary oligonucleotide.
(C) Similarly, MU melanoma cells also demonstrate a decrease in caspase-3 (3.3-fold) and 7 (2.6-fold) at 96 hrs of treatment with T-oligo
as compared to the complementary oligo. (D) To confirm increased caspase-3 catalytic activity in response to T-oligo treatment, MU cells
were treated as described above for 72 or 96 hrs and subsequently collected and analyzed for caspase-3 activity using the CaspACE assay
system. Caspase-3 activity is increased by 4.5-fold and 4-fold at 72 and 96 hrs, respectively. Immunoblots are representative of at least three
independent experiments. Analysis of caspase-3 activity was done in triplicate with error bars representing standard deviation. (* = p<0.01)

overhang and recruitment of telomerase [13]. Inhibitors
of tankyrase-1 prevent PARsylation of TRF1 [12] thereby
preventing exposure of the telomere overhang with
consequences including an inability of telomerase to bind
the telomere and subsequent development of senescence
[13, 38]. To determine the role of telomere exposure in
induction of T-oligo’s DNA damage responses, we utilized
XAV939 and 3AB, inhibitors of tankyrase-1.

proliferation (Fig 5A,B) [18]. However, simultaneous
treatment with XAV939 or 3AB completely blocked
T-oligo-induced inhibition of cellular proliferation since
cells treated with T-oligo and 3AB or XAV939 are not
significantly different from cells treated with diluent or
complementary oligonucleotide and 3AB or XAV939
as determined by one-way ANOVA. Further, treatment
with XAV939 or 3AB prevented T-oligo induced p53
phosphorylation (Fig 5C). These results suggest that
tankyrase-1 must be able to PARsylate and remove TRF1
from the telomere in order for T-oligo to induce a DNA
damage response. Immunoblotting of MU cells treated
with T-oligo demonstrate upregulation of TRF2 (Fig
5D), and treatment with XAV939 or 3AB blocked this

effect. This is the first demonstration of T-oligo mediated
upregulation of TRF2. These results are novel and suggest
an important requirement of tankyrase-1 activity leading
to TRF1 dissociation from the telomere for induction of
T-oligo-mediated DNA damage responses.

DISCUSSION
Investigation into telomere biology is an important
area for understanding tumor biology and identification
of novel therapeutic modalities [2]. T-oligo has important
therapeutic potential in multiple tumor types, but its
mechanism is not fully defined. In this manuscript,
we demonstrate induction of a caspase cascade and
upregulation of differentiation markers in p53-expressing
MU, PM-WK, and MM-MC cells. Further, we verify
the importance of p53 in the downstream DNA damage
responses induced by T-oligo. We also inhibit tankyrase-1
activity and demonstrate a requirement for tankyrase-1
activity in T-oligo induced DNA damage responses.
p53 expression and phosphorylation are hallmarks
of the DNA damage response seen in cells exposed to
DNA alkylating agents [39], exposure of the telomere
overhang through disruption of the T-loop structure
[40], and exposure to T-oligo [4, 20]. However, its role

course of 72 hrs of exposure to T-oligo. Both TRP-1 and TRP-2 are increased over the entire course of 12 to 72 hrs of T-oligo treatment
(2.9-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively). Immunoblots are representative of at least three independent experiments.

in T-oligo induced apoptosis has been questioned as lack
of p53 does not block T-oligo induced apoptosis in cells
that do not express p53 [3, 4, 19, 22]. In cells that do
express p53, we suggest that p53 is still likely to play an
important role in driving DNA damage responses. In this
study, p53-expressing melanoma cells undergo a caspase
cascade and exhibit signs of differentiation upon exposure
to T-oligo. Further, knockdown of p53 completely blocks
T-oligo induced differentiation and significantly decreases
apoptosis after exposure to T-oligo. However, the inability
for p53 knockdown to completely block T-oligo induced
apoptosis suggests other pathways likely contribute.
p73, a p53 homologue, is upregulated in p53-deficient
melanoma cells after exposure to T-oligo and transfection
of a dominant-negative p73 significantly decreases T-oligo
induced apoptosis [4]. Alternatively, the WRN helicase,
which responds to disruption in the telomere overhang, is
also suggested to play a role in T-oligo induced apoptosis
[24], although the mechanism whereby WRN signals for a
DNA damage response is unclear. Although these results
suggest that p53 is likely to play an important role in
T-oligo induced DNA damage responses, further research
is required to understand other key proteins involved in
T-oligo induced DNA damage responses.

Despite an increasing understanding of T-oligo’s
DNA damage responses [4, 19-21] and demonstration
of T-oligo’s potential as a therapeutic in multiple tumor
types [3, 5, 22, 28, 29], little is understood of how T-oligo
activates the DNA damage responses. ATM and WRN, a
helicase protein, have been implicated [19, 24] as primary
drivers, but it is unclear how T-oligo is able to signal for
DNA damage. Others have suggested that T-oligo mimics
an exposed 3′ telomere overhang, thus initiating the DNA
damage pathway [19, 41]. This conclusion is based on
observations that the DNA damage responses induced
by T-oligo and disruption of the telomere overhang by
transfection with a dominant-negative TRF2 follow
similar pathways and time-courses [5, 19]. However,
administration of T-oligo does not cause degradation of the
telomere overhang, seen in TRF2 disruption [19]. Further,
these observations do not account for an increase in mean
telomere length [4] or transient telomerase activation in
response to T-oligo administration [42]. In light of these
observations, we suggest that T-oligo does not simply
“mimic” the telomere overhang.
TRF1 and TRF2 function to stabilize the telomere
overhang through their association with the shelterin
complex [6] and tankyrase-1 is proposed to allow

expression can be seen at 72 hrs (10-fold) and 96 hrs (2.2-fold). (B) MU cells treated with siRNA against p53 for 12 hrs were then exposed

Knockdown of p53 decreased T-oligo-induced apoptosis by 45%. Immunoblots are representative of at least three independent experiments.
Determination of apoptosis was performed in quadruplicate with error bars representing standard deviation. Statistical analysis by the
Student’s T-test found a significant difference between cells treated with T-oligo and those treated with both siRNA against p53 and T-oligo.

telomerase to function through destabilization of shelterin
through PARsylation of TRF1 [13, 14]. Tankyrase-1
inhibitors prevent TRF1 dissociation from the telomere
[43] and are thought to contribute to apoptosis through
increased sister chromatid exchanges at the telomeres [17],
or inhibition of telomerase [43]. In this study, we confirm a
decrease in cellular proliferation by tankyrase-1 inhibition,
but also demonstrate that inhibition of tankyrase-1
abrogates T-oligo-induced p53 phosphorylation and
decreased cellular proliferation. These results suggest
that tankyrase-1 function is vital to T-oligo mediated
anticancer effects.
At present the role of tankyrase-1 in T-oligo
mediated DNA damage responses is unclear. We suggest
that T-oligo binds to shelterin associated proteins
following PARsylation of TRF1, and recruits the shelterin
complex away from the telomere (Fig 6). In this uncapped
state, telomeres are exposed, thus providing an opportunity
for recognition as DNA damage foci by ATM or WRN [19,
24]. Alternatively, this allows for binding of the telomere
by telomerase, previously suggested by evidence that
T-oligo increases mean telomere length [19], possibly
through a transient increase in telomerase activity [42].
An increase in mean telomere length may also explain

our finding of increased TRF2 expression after exposure
to T-oligo since elongated telomeres require increased
TRF2 for stability [6]. This is in contrast to treatment
with TRF2DN which results in telomere degradation
[4], or other studies that show upregulation of TRF2
maintains the telomere duplex structure. In the present
experiment, we propose that inhibition of tankyrase-1
maintains the integrity of the telomere, thus completely
blocking T-oligo induced DNA damage responses and
suggesting that destabilization of the telomere overhang
is a requirement for T-oligo to act as a therapeutic agent.
These results suggest that T-oligo functions to prevent
restabilization following dissociation of TRF1 from the
shelterin complex, leading to disruption of the T-loop
and downstream DNA damage responses. We therefore
suggest additional experiments involving disruption of
TRF1 to further define its role in T-oligo-induced DNA
damage responses.
In addition to PARsylating TRF1, tankyrase-1
contributes many functions to cellular physiology
including PARsylation of axin, targeting it for
ubiquitination and degradation, and inhibiting the Wnt
pathway causing growth inhibition [18] and regulation of
mitosis [44]. At present, there is no data to suggest that

MU cells to T-oligo induces a 2.6-fold increase in TRF2 levels, but this effect is also blocked by treatment with XAV939 or 3AB. The
effects of T-oligo after XAV939 or 3AB treatment are not significant by analysis using one-way ANOVA. Immunoblots are representative
of at least three independent experiments. (*= p<0.001)

T-oligo could function to modulate these other pathways;
however these findings suggest new avenues of research.
In this study, we document considerable advances
in understanding the mechanism of T-oligo induced
DNA damage responses. p53 is shown to be an important
contributor to T-oligo induced apoptosis and differentiation
in p53-expressing melanoma cells. Further, inhibition
of tankyrase-1 prevents T-oligo induced DNA damage
responses, suggesting a new paradigm in understanding
T-oligo’s mechanism of action. These results are novel,
important and provide new insight into telomere biology
and the mechanism whereby T-oligo induces DNA damage
responses.

various time points. After which, cells were harvested and
protein lysates immunoblotted as described previously
[46]. p53 (pantropic) antibody (clone DO-1, #OP43A)
was obtained from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA).
phospho-p53 (Ser 15) (#:9284) polyclonal antibodies,
cleaved Caspase-3 (Clone 5A1E, Rabbit mAb #9664),
cleaved Caspase-7 (Clone D6H1, Rabbit mAb #8438),
and cleaved Caspase-9 (Clone D2D4, Rabbit mAb #7237)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA). For detection of differentiation, the following
antibodies were used; tyrosinase monoclonal antibody
(clone T311: NovacastraTM, Leica Biosystems Newcastle

MATERIAL AND METHODS:
Oligonucleotides:
11-base DNA oligonucleotides homologous
(pGTTAGGGTTAG) (T-oligo) and complementary
(pCTAACCCTAAC) (complementary oligo) to the 3’
telomere overhang sequence were obtained from Midland
Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX) for cell
culture experiments.

Figure 6: Proposed mechanism of T-oligo induced activation of the DNA damage response through recruitment of
the shelterin complex. The shelterin complex, composed of TRF1, TRF2, TIN1, POT1, TPP1, and RAP1 stabilizes the telomere

and prevents telomere overhang exposure. Tankyrase causes dissociation of shelterin through PARsylation of TRF1, leading to telomere
overhang disruption. T-oligo is then able to bind the shelterin complex and maintain exposure of the telomere overhang which leads to
either telomere elongation or DNA damage responses including apoptosis or differentiation.

Tankyrase-1 inhibition:

upon Tyne, UK), TRP-1 (sc 10443) and TRP-2 (sc 10452)
polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), and MART-1/Melan-A monoclonal antibody
(clone M2-7C10: Signet, Dedham, MA). The TRF1
antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Jan Karlseder, and
TRF2 antibody was purchased from (#NB110-57130:
Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Beta-actin antibody
(#A-5441), Sheep anti-Mouse IgG (#NA931V), and
Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (#NA934V) were purchased
from GE healthcare (Piscataway, NJ), and all other
chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).

For measuring the effect of tankyrase-1 inhibitors
on T-oligo induced cellular proliferation in MU melanoma
cells, triplicate cell cultures were plated at 6x104 cells
in 60 mm2 dishes in MEM with 10% FBS and treated
with tankyrase-1 inhibitors, XAV939 (5µM) or 3AB
(20mM), or equal amount of diluent (water), and a final
concentration of 40 μM T-oligo, complementary oligo,
or equal amount of diluent (water). After 24 hrs, cells
were prepared for immunoblotting. After 96 hrs, cells
were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer in
the presence of trypan blue. Statistical significance was
determined using the one-way ANOVA with significance
established at alpha=0.05.

Transfection of p53 siRNA:

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

MU melanoma cells were transfected with four
pooled siRNA duplexes, from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO)
against p53 (#M-003329-03-0005) in optiMEM (#11058021, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using oligofectamine
(#12252-011: Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Mock
transfection was done in parallel using signal silence
control siRNA (#6568S: Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA).

Determination of Apoptosis:
Melanoma cells were cultured as described
previously and transfected with siRNA for 12 hrs and
subsequently treated with diluent (water), 40 μM T-oligo,
or 40 μM complementary oligo for 72 hrs. Cells were then
stained with propidium iodide (#81845: Sigma-Aldrich;
St. Louis, MO) and analyzed by a Becton Dickinson FACS
Scan. Apoptosis was studied by determining sub Go/G1
DNA content by FACS analysis as described previously
[3]. Statistical significance was determined using the
paired Student’s T-test with significance established at
alpha=0.05.
Apoptosis was also determined by evaluation of
caspase-3 activity using the CaspACE assay system
(#G7351) from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin).
Quadruplicate cultures of melanoma cells were treated
with diluent (water), 40 μM control oligonucleotide, or 40
μM T-oligo for 72 or 96 hrs. Cells were then collected by
centrifugation, washed and lysed by repeated freeze/thaw
cycles. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation
and the supernatant was used for protein estimation and
for the caspase assay. This assay uses Ac-DEVD-pNA as
a substrate and colorimetrically measures the release of
free pNA. Statistical significance was determined using
the paired Student’s T-test with significance established
at alpha=0.05.
