Abstract

Introduction

Overexpression of HER-2/neu (c-erbB2) is associated with
increased risk of recurrent disease in ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) and a poorer prognosis in node-positive breast cancer.
We therefore examined the early immunotherapeutic targeting of HER-2/neu in DCIS. Before surgical resection, HER-2/
neu pos DCIS patients (n = 13) received 4 weekly vaccinations of
dendritic cells pulsed with HER-2/neu HLA class I and II
peptides. The vaccine dendritic cells were activated in vitro
with IFN-; and bacterial lipopolysaccharide to become highly
polarized DC1-type dendritic cells that secrete high levels of
interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70). Intranodal delivery of dendritic
cells supplied both antigenic stimulation and a synchronized
preconditioned burst of IL-12p70 production directly to the
anatomic site of T-cell sensitization. Before vaccination, many
subjects possessed HER-2/neu–HLA-A2 tetramer-staining
CD8pos T cells that expressed low levels of CD28 and high
levels of the inhibitory B7 ligand CTLA-4, but this ratio
inverted after vaccination. The vaccinated subjects also
showed high rates of peptide-specific sensitization for both
IFN-;–secreting CD4pos (85%) and CD8pos (80%) T cells, with
recognition of antigenically relevant breast cancer lines,
accumulation of T and B lymphocytes in the breast, and
induction of complement-dependent, tumor-lytic antibodies.
Seven of 11 evaluable patients also showed markedly
decreased HER-2/neu expression in surgical tumor specimens,
often with measurable decreases in residual DCIS, suggesting
an active process of ‘‘immunoediting’’ for HER-2/neu–
expressing tumor cells following vaccination. DC1 vaccination
strategies may therefore have potential for both the prevention and the treatment of early breast cancer. [Cancer Res
2007;67(4):1842–52]

Therapeutic anticancer vaccines hold great promise for the
control of malignancies, but there is no clear consensus about how
they may best be optimized. For example, controversies exist
relating to whether vaccines should be deployed primarily against
early- versus late-stage (i.e., metastatic) disease (1). Additionally,
there are unresolved issues surrounding the selection of appropriate tumor target antigens. With respect to dendritic cell–based
vaccines, there is little agreement about which dendritic cell
properties best promote therapeutic efficacy, the culture and
activation regimens best suited to maximize these properties, or
the optimal route of vaccine delivery (2–4).
Despite this general lack of consensus, it could be reasonably
argued that early disease settings represent promising opportunities for successful immunotherapy, due in part to the absence
of both bulky disease and the negative consequences of prior
radiation treatments or chemotherapy (5). In addition, vaccine
efficacy may be enhanced by antigen selection that includes
proteins linked to tumor aggressiveness and survival, as well as
the capacity to stimulate both CD8pos and CD4pos T cells.
Furthermore, dendritic cells that secrete high levels of interleukin
(IL)-12p70 may offer unique advantages, due to their ability to
maximize IFN-g production and functional avidity in T cells (6),
provided issues of ‘‘dendritic cell exhaustion’’ are addressed (7).
Finally, because the immune system evolved primarily to respond
against microbial invasion, dendritic cell–based anticancer vaccine
strategies may be potentiated by the inclusion of Toll-like receptor
(TLR) agonists as dendritic cell activators (8). This may be
especially beneficial when overexpressed, but nonmutated proteins, such as HER-2/neu, are used as vaccine antigens because
mimicking infectious nonself may facilitate the breaking of
tolerance.
We report here preliminary results for the first 13 subjects in a
clinical trial to vaccinate against ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),
a preinvasive malignancy of the breast. This strategy focused on
HER-2/neu–expressing tumors, due to this frequent association of
protein with poorer prognosis (9), and the availability of both MHC
class II– and class I–restricted immunogenic peptides. We also
used a DC1 polarization culture technique, including TLR agonist
exposure [bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], to exploit the
potential benefits of signaling infectious nonself and to assure
robust IL-12 secretion at the time of vaccination. This unique
activation strategy actually preconditioned dendritic cells for an
apparent second burst of IL-12 if these cells subsequently encountered CD40 ligand. Injecting the vaccines directly into lymph

nodes also delivered a defined quantity of freshly antigen-loaded
dendritic cells directly to the site of T-cell sensitization and
within the time frame of IL-12 secretion bursts. The prescheduled
resection of tumor following vaccinations also afforded the
opportunity for quantitative histologic analyses of the effects of
immunotherapy.
To date, this vaccination strategy has yielded very high rates of
T-cell sensitization against both peptide and tumor targets and
generated complement-fixing, tumor-lytic antibodies. We have
also observed reductions in extent of DCIS and levels of expression
of HER-2 after vaccination in several of the subjects. These early
results suggest that this strategy may have direct implications for
both prevention and therapy of breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Clinical trial design. Patients with histologically confirmed DCIS with
HER-2/neu overexpression (>2+ intensity) in at least 10% of cells [assayed by
HercepTest and verified by single pathologist (P.J.Z.)] were recruited to this
Institutional Review Board–approved clinical trial. Subjects were screened
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before enrollment to eliminate
individuals with obvious areas of invasive disease in either breast. Only
patients requiring further surgical therapy for DCIS were eligible for
neoadjuvant administration of study vaccine. All patients underwent
cardiac evaluation with multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiography to document adequate baseline cardiac function. These scans
were done before the first dose of vaccine and within 2 weeks of the final
dose. All patients underwent HLA class I tissue typing pre-enrollment
and had routine history, physical exams, EKG, blood work, and urinalysis
before vaccination. After obtaining informed consent, all patients had a
prevaccine leukapheresis done to obtain sufficient numbers of monocytes
for vaccine preparation; in a few cases, a second pheresis was required
for additional monocytes. A postvaccination pheresis was also done,
usually within 2 weeks of the final vaccination, to obtain postimmunization
lymphocytes for evaluation. All patients underwent postvaccine mammography, MRI, and surgical resection of DCIS with either lumpectomy or
mastectomy. An interim analysis for feasibility was planned after the first
nine patients were enrolled.
Materials and reagents. All HER-2/neu–derived peptides were purchased from the American Peptide Corp. (Sunnyvale, CA). Serum-free
medium (SFM) monocyte-macrophage medium and Iscove’s medium was
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Lymphocyte separation medium
was obtained from ICN Inc. (Aurora, OH). Human AB serum and FCS were
purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Reagents
for ELISA assays were obtained from PharMingen (San Jose, CA). Clinical
grade IFN-g was purchased from Intermune (Brisbane, CA) and clinical
grade LPS was obtained from NIH (Bethesda, MD) through generous gift
from Dr. Anthony Suffredini. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) for vaccine production was purchased from Berlex
(Richmond, CA). The CD40 ligand trimer was a generous gift from Amgen.
Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Berlex (Richmond, CA).
HER-2/neu (369–377) MHC tetramer was purchased from Beckman Coulter
(Fullerton, CA).
Vaccination procedure. Vaccines were administered in the NIH General
Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The vaccines consisted of
10 to 20 million HER-2/neu–pulsed DC1 cells suspended in 1-mL sterile
saline. The vaccines were administered by Ultrasound guidance into a single
lymph node in each groin as described previously (4), half of each vaccine
was placed into each node with a 22-g needle. The first nine subjects were
observed for 2 h after vaccination with routine vital signs obtained at
15-min intervals. Subsequent subjects were observed for 1 h. Vaccines were
administered once weekly for 4 weeks. All subjects completed all four
scheduled vaccines.
Preparation of HER-2/neu–pulsed DC1. All patients underwent initial
leukapheresis on Baxter CS3000 using monocyte enrichment settings in
the Apheresis Unit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.

The apheresis product was then elutriated using Beckman Elutriator in
the Cell Processing Facility as described previously (10). DC1 were prepared
under Investigational New Drug (IND) BB-11043 under good clinical
practice conditions. Monocytes were transferred to the Clinical Cell and
Vaccine Production Facility where they were washed, counted, and either
cryopreserved for later use or vaccine was directly prepared. DC1 were
prepared using a rapid activation protocol described previously (6).
Monocytes were cultured at 3  106/mL in monocyte-macrophage SFM,
in sterile 24-well plates with GM-CSF overnight at 37jC. The next morning,
monocyte pools were pulsed with one of six HER-2/neu MHC class II
binding peptides, three extracellular domain (ECD) peptides (42–56, 98–114,
and 328–345), and three intracellular domain (ICD) peptides (776–790,
927–941, and 1166–1180). After 8 to 12 h of further incubation, IFN-g
(1,000 units/mL) was added and cells were subsequently cultured overnight.
Six hours before harvest, LPS was added at 10 ng/mL. If the patient was
HLA-A2pos, the monocyte pools were divided in half and each was pulsed
with either MHC class I binding peptide 369 to 377 (11) or 689 to 697.
The cells were harvested 2 h later, washed, counted, assessed for viability,
and placed in a final administration volume of 1 mL in sterile saline.
Samples of the vaccine were sent for bacterial and endotoxin testing. Lot
release criteria required a viability of >70% as assessed by trypan blue
dye exclusion, gram stain negative, and an endotoxin level of <5 endotoxin
units/kg. Vaccines were evaluated for functional activation by flow
cytometry and aliquots of monocyte medium were cryopreserved to assess
IL-12p70 production by ELISA as described previously (6). All vaccines
prepared met all release criteria. Vaccines 2 to 4 were prepared as above
using cryopreserved monocytes.
Flow cytometry. Analysis of surface markers CD14-FITC, CD80-PE,
CD86-PE, and CD83-PE was done on a FACSCalibur and analyzed using
CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Tetramer staining. Prevaccination or postvaccination CD8pos T cells
were either thawed and analyzed or sensitized by dendritic cells pulsed with
the peptide HER-2/neu p369 to 377 for 10 days as described below. They
were then harvested and stained with allophycocyanin (APC)–labeled HER2/neu p369 to 377 tetramer and anti-CD8-FITC, anti-CD28-PE, or antiCTLA-4-PE for 30 min. Cells were washed and subjected to flow cytometry
analysis. APC-labeled MART-1 p27-35 tetramer was used for background
control.
Enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Anti-IFN-g antibody was purchased from Mabtech, Inc. (Mariemont, OH) and the enzyme-linked
immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was done according the manufacturer’s
instructions. Multiscreen filter plates (MAIPSWU10) were purchased from
Millipore (Billerica, MA). Substrate solution (TMB-H) was purchased from
Moss (Pasadena, MD). Coating antibody (1-D1K) was diluted to 12 Ag/mL in
sterile PBS. The ELISPOT plates were prewet with 70% ethanol for 1 min at
room temperature and washed five times with sterile water. After addition
of the coating antibody (100 AL/well), the plates were incubated overnight
at 4jC to 8jC. The plates were washed five times with sterile PBS before
the addition of 200 AL/well of culture medium. After blocking for
>30 min, the medium was removed. CD4 cells were added with either
immature or mature dendritic cells, pulsed with the ICD and ECD peptides
(total of 150 AL/well) at a ratio of 1  105 to 2  104. Tetanus was used as
control stimulus. The cells were incubated at 37jC for 20 h. The plates were
then washed five times with 200 AL PBS. One hundred microliters of
detection antibody (7-B6-1-biotin) diluted to 1 Ag/mL in PBS with 0.5% FCS
were added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature
for 2 h. After washing five times, 1:1,000 diluted streptavidin-horseradish
peroxidase in PBS with 0.5% FCS was added before incubation for an
additional hour. The plates were washed and 100 AL of substrate solution
were added to each well. After color development, wells were rigidly washed
with tap water. The plates were dried at room temperature and read in an
ELISPOT reader (Immunospot CTL, Cleveland, OH). At routine intervals,
the relative coefficient of variance was determined. The maximum value
was 23% (1,029 F 63.34 = 0.448%; 993 F 71 = 3.18%; 635 F 1.52 = 0.09%;
596 F 35.2 = 2.4%; 99 F 23.8 = 12%; and 120 F 55.25 = 23%).
CD4pos T-cell in vitro sensitization. CD4pos T cells from thawed
prevaccination or postvaccination lymphocytes were prepared with

negative selection columns as described previously (6). CD4pos T cells were
sensitized by autologous dendritic cells pulsed with either HER-2/neu ECD
or ICD peptides at a ratio of 10:1. IL-2 (60 IU/mL) was added to the cultures
the next day. T cells were harvested on day 10 and tested for their antigen
specificity. CD4pos T cells (105) were cocultured with dendritic cells (104)
pulsed with HER-2/neu peptides or dendritic cells pulsed with B-Raf kinase
in 96-well plates. After 24 h of coculture, supernatants were harvested and
IFN-g release was measured by ELISA.
CD8pos T-cell sensitization. Autologous dendritic cells were pulsed
with HER-2/neu p369 to 377 or p689 to 697 at 10 Ag/mL 2 h before
harvest. Dendritic cells were then cocultured with column-purified
prevaccination or postvaccination CD8pos T cells at a ratio of 10:1 in
48-well plates. IL-2 (30 IU/mL) was added to the cultures on day 2. After
10 days of sensitization, the CD8pos T cells were harvested and
restimulated with T2 cells pulsed with either relevant or irrelevant
peptides or tested against breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
(HER-2/neu neg and HLA-A2pos), MDA-MB-435S and SK-BR-3 (HER-2/neu pos
and HLA-A2neg ), and ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 (HER-2/neu pos–
and HLA-0201*–transfected or nontransfected cells; a kind gift of Dr. Mary
Disis, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Supernatants were harvested
after 24 h and analyzed by ELISA.
Immunohistochemical staining of DCIS lesions. Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 Am on plus slides
(Fisher Scientific, Hanover Park, IL), Hanover Park, IL. Sections were heated
for 1 h at 60jC to remove excess paraffin, cooled for 10 min, and
subsequently deparaffinized and rehydrated in a series of xylenes and
alcohols. Immunohistochemistry was done using the DAKO Autostainer
(DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). All tissues were stained for HercepTest (DAKO),
CD1a (Novocastra Laboratories, Vision BioSystems, Inc., Norwell, MA), CD3
(Novocastra Laboratories), CD4 (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA), CD8
(DAKO), CD20 (DAKO), CD45RO (DAKO), CD56 (Monosan, Uden, the
Netherlands), CD68 (DAKO), CD69 (LabVision Corp., Neomarkers, Fremont,
CA), Granzyme (LabVision, Neomarkers), FoxP3 (BioLegend, San Diego,
CA), HLA class II (DAKO), and IgG (DAKO).
Complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay. SK-BR-3, a highly positive
HER-2/neu–expressing breast cancer cell line, was used as a positive target
and the melanoma cell line MEL624-A2neg that does not express HER-2/
neu was used as a negative target. Briefly, 1  104 cells were plated and
incubated overnight at 37jC. Cultures were done in quadruplets. Human
serum was inactivated at 56jC for 30 min and diluted 1:2. Fifty microliters
of serum were added to the cell cultures for 1 h. Twenty microliters of
guinea pig complement (diluted 1:4; Sigma Chemical) was added to half
of the wells. The other half served as antibody control. After 4 h, 15 AL
WST1 was added to the wells. The plates were analyzed by an ELISA
reader at 3 and 4.5 h at a wavelength of 450. The percentage cytotoxicity
was calculated using the following formula: [(a
b) / (a
c)]  100
(where a = cells in antibody only; b = cells in antibody plus complement;
and c = medium only).
Statistical methods. To compare the mean number of HER-2/neu 369 to
377 tetramer binding (in 105 CD8pos T cells), between healthy donors and
DCIS patients, and to compare HER-2/neu expression on initial biopsy with
postsurgical biopsies for the vaccine patients compared with a group of
unvaccinated control subjects, a Wilcoxon rank test was used. To compare
the initial burst with the additional burst of IL-12 by DC1, a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test for paired data was used. All significance values were two
sided. Statistical analyses were done with SPSS 12.0 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL).

Results
Vaccine scheme and clinical trial design. Ex vivo activated
DC1 (high IL-12–secreting dendritic cells) were prepared from
autologous monocytes under Food and Drug Administration IND
BB-11043 (Fig. 1A). Dendritic cells were pulsed individually with six
MHC class II peptides derived from HER-2/neu as described
previously by Disis et al. (12). The dendritic cells of HLA-A2pos

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

subjects were additionally pulsed with two HLA-A2–binding
peptides (369–377 and 689–697) shown previously to stimulate
CD8pos T cells (13–15). The intention of the combined MHC class II
and class I peptide design was to promote CD4pos antigen-specific
help for CD8posT cells, partly by fostering an additional in vivo
burst of IL-12 production through CD40 ligation of the administered DC1 (Fig. 1B). All patients were treated with 4 weekly HER-2/
neu–pulsed autologous DC1 (10–20 million per vaccine) immunizations administered by intranodal route. Following completion of
the vaccines, patients underwent immunologic testing followed by
definitive surgical therapy. All patients underwent prevaccine and
postvaccine cardiac evaluation with MUGA or echocardiogram to
assess cardiac changes and vaccine safety. All patients completed
the four scheduled vaccinations and vaccines were well tolerated
with only CTC grade 1 or 2 toxicity consisting of anticipated lowgrade fever, fatigue, chills, nausea, or injection site tenderness.
There was no evidence of cardiac toxicity manifested by significant
postvaccine ejection fraction on MUGA scan, all of which remained
in the reference range or any clinical symptoms during 1 year of
follow-up.
Monocytes treated with IFN-; and TLR-4 agonist LPS show
properties of mature polarized DC1. As expected, monocytederived dendritic cells from DCIS patients displayed enhanced
levels of CD80, CD86, and CD83 when activated with IFN-g and
LPS (Fig. 1C). The dendritic cells also displayed CD40 upregulation (Fig. 1C). An initial burst of IL-12p70 production
(500–10,000 pg/mL) was observed for all patients’ dendritic cells,
consistent with DC1 polarization (16). To test whether these
dendritic cells retained the potential to produce additional
IL-12 should they encounter CD4pos CD40Lpos T cells, IFN-g/
LPS–treated dendritic cells were washed and incubated in
fresh medium for 12 to 36 h before restimulation solely with
recombinant CD40L. The prepared patient dendritic cells could
consistently produce an additional IL-12p70 burst (range, 10,000–
30,000 pg/mL) that even significantly exceeded the magnitude of
the original burst (P = 0.028; Fig. 1D). Hence, in vitro TLR agonistinduced DC1 polarization preconditioned dendritic cells for a
second IL-12 burst through subsequent CD40-CD40L interactions
(Fig. 1B).
Evidence of negative regulation of anti-HER-2 T cells in
patients with DCIS. Peripheral blood CD8pos lymphocytes from
patients with DCIS were assessed in the HLA-A2pos cohort before
vaccination for preexisting anti-HER-2/neu responses. Compared
with healthy donors, there were elevated numbers (mean 77  105
for DCIS patients versus mean 36  105 for healthy donors; P =
0.033) of HER-2/neu 369 to 377 tetramerpos CD8pos T cells (Fig. 2A).
We additionally examined T-cell expression of B7 ligands in this
cohort. Before vaccination, tetramer-staining T cells expressed high
levels of CTLA-4 (inhibitory signaling) relative to CD28 (activation
signaling). After vaccination, however, this ratio became inverted
(Fig. 2B). Additionally, in contrast to healthy donors, prevaccine
CD8pos T cells sensitized using DC1 pulsed with 369 to 377 class I
peptide did not secrete IFN-g in response to HER-2/neu 369 to 377
pulsed targets except in one subject. However, postvaccine T cells
routinely acquired this property (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Figs. S1
and S2). Collectively, these results suggest a negative regulatory
mechanism(s) for T cells naturally sensitized to HER-2/neu that
was operative even at very early (preinvasive) stages of cancer, but
which could be reversed by DC1 vaccination.
DC1 vaccines induce HER-2/neu–reactive CD4pos T cells. We
evaluated CD4pos anti-HER-2/neu responses by two methods. The

first method used was ELISPOT to quantify T cells in peripheral
blood without in vitro expansion. The second was an in vitro
sensitization assay (IVS), in which lymphocytes were first
stimulated and expanded for one round (10 days) in vitro and
then restimulated and assessed by ELISA for secreted IFN-g. Both
assays used HER-2/neu peptide-loaded dendritic cells as stimulators. A summary of all patient immune responses is summarized
in Supplementary Table S1. Of 11 testable subjects, 10 (91%) had
>5-fold postvaccination increases in the number of IFN-g spots
against at least one MHC class II–restricted HER-2/neu peptide
epitope, and the observed increases were usually of an even greater
magnitude (Fig. 3A). A representative comparison of absolute
numbers of IFN-g secretion spots is shown for subject 08102-05

(Fig. 3B). To determine whether such increases in spot number
were a specific consequence of vaccination, we also tested the
prevaccine and postvaccine response when tetanus-pulsed dendritic cells were used as stimulators. The ratios of postvaccine to
prevaccine tetanus-specific IFN-g spots were consistently in the 1
to 2 range, indicating absent or scant modulation by the vaccine
procedure (Fig. 3A). When assayed by IVS instead of by ELISPOT,
10 of 13 (77%) subjects responded to HER-2/neu peptides after
vaccination with greater than a 2-fold increase in IFN-g secretion
compared with control peptides (Fig. 3C and D). Most of the
subjects developed responses to more than one of the six MHC
class II peptides used (Fig. 3). As anticipated, ELISPOT and IVS
results did not always precisely concur, due to repertoire disparities

Figure 1. Preparation of HER-2/neu–pulsed-DC1 vaccines. A, peripheral blood monocytes were obtained by combined leukapheresis and elutriation. The monocytes
were cultured in SFM with GM-CSF and IL-4 overnight. The next day, immature dendritic cells (iDC ) were pulsed in separate wells with one of six HER-2/neu
MHC class II–derived peptides. IFN-g was added later in the day, and the following morning, LPS was added to complete maturation of DC1. For HLA-A2pos patients,
half of the DC1 were pulsed with MHC class I binding peptide 369 to 377 and the other half with 689 to 697 for 2 h. The DC1 were harvested, release criteria were
met, and 10 to 20 million HER-2/neu –pulsed DC1 were administered by intranodal injection into normal groin nodes. One injection was given in each side of the
groin (half the vaccine in 0.5 cc each groin node). B, schematic of proposed affect of HER-2/neu –pulsed DC1 on the cellular immune response. Primed DC1 produce
IL-12 and present MHC class II peptides to CD4pos T cells. T-cell activation results in CD40L expression that in turn signals through CD40 on dendritic cells. This
enhances dendritic cell maturation and facilitates additional IL-12 production, which leads to high avidity CD8pos antitumor T cells and CD4pos Th1 cells. The IFN-g
production by CD4pos T cells can potentially induce immunoglobulin class switching in B cells. C, primed DC1 show characteristics of mature dendritic cells. Following
maturation with IFN-g and LPS, dendritic cells express high levels of CD80, CD86, and CD83 and low-level expression of CD14. The data are from one vaccine
from one patient and are representative of most vaccines, although there was some observed variation in levels of CD83 expression. D, primed DC1 produce high levels
of IL-12p70. DC1 were prepared as described in Materials and Methods. Supernatants from DC1 from the first six subjects were sampled for IL-12p70 production after
16 h following addition of LPS. IL-12 production ranged from 500 to 8,000 pg/mL (blue columns ). The DC1 were activated with LPS for 6 h as is done for vaccine
administration then cultured in SFM for 16 h, washed, and treated with CD40L trimer. IL-12p70 production was then assessed after additional 14 h. DC1 from all
subjects showed the ability to produce an additional burst of IL-12p70 range 10 to 25 ng/mL (red columns ). DC1 cultured in the absence of CD40L produced less than
500 pg/mL (data not shown). Results are representative from the DC1 from the first six subjects. The comparison between the amount of IL-12p70 produced by mature
DC1 and those additionally activated by CD40L was compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data.

to the immunodominant HER-2/neu peptide 369 to 377. The cells were counterstained with FITC anti-CD8. For each subject, the number of cells showing
tetramer-positive binding per 100,000 cells was calculated and the two groups were compared by Wilcoxon rank test. B, anti-HER-2/neu CD8pos T cells before
vaccination display enhanced levels of CTLA-4 compared with CD8pos T cells after vaccination. Purified CD8pos T cells from prevaccine and postvaccine samples were
cocultured with autologous immature dendritic cells pulsed with HER-2/neu 369 to 377 peptide for 7 d. The T cells were harvested and stained using 369 to
377 PE-tetramer and counterstained with FITC anti-CTLA-4, anti-CD28, and anti-CD8. The percentage of HER-2/neu tetramer-positive cells expressing CTLA-4 or
CD28 was calculated for prevaccine and postvaccine samples. Results are from three subjects. Columns, % CTLA-4/% CD28 expression in tetramer HER-2/neu p369

CD8pos T cells were prepared from HLA-A2pos healthy donors or the prevaccine DCIS patients. The T cells were cocultured with autologous DC1 pulsed with HER-2/neu
369 to 377 peptide for 1 wk. The T cells were harvested and tested for specificity by IFN-g release against T2 cells pulsed with HER-2/neu 369 to 377 or
irrelevant HLA-A2–binding peptides. As a control for DC1 activity, the same DC1 were cocultured with postvaccine CD8pos T cells and the T cells were harvested
and tested as above. The results represent a single experiment from one healthy donor and one DCIS patient. A complete set of all healthy donors sensitized with
HER-2/neu –pulsed dendritic cells is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. A profile of HLA-A2pos DCIS prevaccine and postvaccine peptide sensitization data is shown in

between uncultured and culture-proliferated cells (17), but these
dual analyses corroborated vaccine responsiveness to at least one
MHC class II–restricted HER-2/neu peptide epitope for 11 of 13
(85%) patients (Fig. 3). Furthermore, a consistent absence of
detectable IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 production indicated that such
CD4pos T-cell responsiveness reflected a strongly polarized TH1
phenotype (data not shown).
HER-2/neu–pulsed DC1 vaccines induce CD8pos T cells that
directly recognize HER-2/neu–overexpressing breast cancer
lines. We observed an increase in the numbers of 369 to 377 peptide
tetramerpos CD8pos T cells in most patients following vaccination
(Fig. 4A), with further amplification of tetramer-binding frequency,

following in vitro stimulation with peptide-pulsed dendritic cells.
Despite this, one of the ten HLA-A2pos subjects’ displayed
prevaccination evidence of CD8pos T cells capable of IFN-g secretion
in response to HER-2/neu 369 to 377 peptide-pulsed targets (data
not shown). However, eight of nine (88%) patients acquired such
reactivity to peptide 369 to 377 following vaccination (Fig. 4B;
Supplementary Fig. S2), and five of nine patients developed
reactivity to peptide 689 to 697 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Perhaps,
most importantly, postvaccination CD8pos T cells from all subjects
that developed peptide recognizing CD8 T cells recognized HLAA2pos HER-2/neu–expressing tumor lines (Fig. 4C). Such T cells did
not respond to the HLA-A2neg or HER-2/neu neg control tumor cell

lines, indicating HER-2/neu specificity and HLA-A2 restriction. The
acquisition of direct tumor reactivity was not evident before
completion of all four vaccinations, although reactivity to peptidepulsed T2 cells was often already prominent following first
vaccination (Fig. 4D). It is worth noting that direct recognition of
antigen-expressing tumor cells by peptide-sensitized CD8pos T cells
has historically been difficult to show and that our previous in vitro
work predicted high rates of direct tumor recognition when IL-12–
secreting dendritic cells were used for vaccination.
HER-2/neu–pulsed-DC1 vaccines lead to accumulation of
lymphocytes in the breast and changes in residual DCIS. All

enrolled subjects required conventional definitive surgery after
vaccination to remove residual DCIS, based on the initial surgical
(subjects 1, 3, 4, 10, 11, and 14) or core (subjects 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, and
13) biopsies. Eleven of 13 subjects showed residual DCIS at the time
of postvaccine surgery. The remaining two had either no residual
disease (subject 08102-04) or inadequate tissue (subject 08102-01)
to do HER-2/neu expression analysis (see below).
Immunohistochemical analysis of prevaccination biopsies
showed variable lymphocytic infiltrates in the breast tissue with
some patients showing minimal or moderate infiltrates, such as
shown in Fig. 5A (including CD4pos T cells and B cells). However, in

Figure 3. HER-2/neu –pulsed DC1 vaccine induces evidence of INF-g–secreting CD4pos T cells. A, CD4pos T cells obtained from subjects before and after vaccination
were cocultured with dendritic cells pulsed with HER-2/neu peptides, used for immunization, or left unpulsed. Dendritic cells were also pulsed with tetanus toxoid
and cocultured with T cells to monitor for nonspecific vaccine-induced changes in immune function. ELISPOT for IFN-g were measured directly without ex vivo
stimulation. Individual peptide reactivities were measured in quadruplicate. A T-cell ELISPOT required at least 10 spots to be considered positive. Antigen-specific spots
were subtracted from groups using unpulsed dendritic cells as stimulators to determine the number of spots, and these are presented as the ratio of postvaccine
response to prevaccine response (E). Green diamonds and blue squares, the prevaccine and postvaccine ratio of CD4pos T-cell reactivity to unpulsed and

to 1190. Data are presented from 9 of 13 subjects from whom sufficient T cells were available. Patient 08102-10 did not have enough T cells from prevaccine collection
to do ELISPOT. The results are from the first 10 patients. B, representative data from patient 08102-05 are shown comparing number of IFN-g spots prevaccine
and postvaccine. C, CD4pos T cells purified from prevaccine and postvaccine samples were cocultured with dendritic cells pulsed with HER-2/neu peptides for 10 d
constituting a single round of in vitro stimulation. The CD4pos T cells were harvested and tested for specificity against monocytes pulsed with relevant HER-2/neu
peptides or irrelevant control peptides for 24 h. Supernatants were collected and analyzed for IFN-g by ELISA. Results were considered positive if there was at
least a 2-fold increase in specific IFN-g compared with control. The ratio of postvaccine to prevaccine IFN-g specificity index is presented for the first nine subjects.
There was no evidence of specific secretion of IL-5 or IL-10 (data not shown). D, representative IFN-g secretion from prevaccine and postvaccine CD4pos T cells from

to 377 HER-2/neu –specific CD8pos T cells on prevaccination and postvaccination (unstimulated) peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patient 08102-03 (top ).
CD8pos T cells were purified and cocultured 7 d with 369 to 377 HER-2/neu –pulsed autologous dendritic cells. After 1 wk, CD8pos T cells were harvested and stained
with labeled tetramer bound to peptide 369 to 377. Comparison of prevaccine and postvaccine T cells showed that postvaccine T cells expanded f20-fold in 1 wk
compared with minimal expansion of tetramer-specific T cells from the prevaccine blood stimulated by dendritic cells (bottom ). B, CD8pos T cells were purified
from prevaccine and postvaccine leukapheresis and the CD8pos T cells were cocultured with autologous 369 to 377 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells for 10 d. The CD8pos
T cells were harvested and cocultured overnight with T2 cells (HLA-A2pos) pulsed with 369 to 377 or irrelevant peptides, supernatants were harvested, and IFN-g was
measured by ELISA. Results are from patients 08102-04 and 08102-10. The results from 8 of the 10 HLA-A2pos subjects are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. The
same experiments were carried out using the peptide 688 to 697 and the results for four of the eight patients that showed reactivity to this peptide are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2. C, CD8pos T cells after vaccination show evidence of recognition of tumor cells endogenously expressing HER-2/neu . CD8pos T cells from
prevaccine and postvaccine leukapheresis were cocultured with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with HER-2/neu 369 to 377 for 10 d. The CD8pos T cells were
harvested and cocultured overnight with HER-2/neu pos HLA-A2pos tumors (MDA-MB-231 and SKOV3) and HER-2/neu pos HLA-A2neg (MDA-MB-435S, SKOV3,
SK-BR-3, and OVCAR) or HER-2/neu neg HLA-A2pos MCF-7. The results are from patient 08102-10. There was no evidence of reactivity to any of the tumor cell lines in
the prevaccination CD8pos T cells (data not shown). The results for two cell lines are shown for 8 of 10 HLA-A2pos patients in Supplementary Fig. S2. D, kinetic
development of CD8pos T cells following 369 to 377 HER-2/neu –pulsed DC1 vaccination. CD8pos T cells were purified from leukapheresis before vaccination, following a
single vaccination and after completion of all four vaccines. The CD8pos T cells from 08102-06 were cocultured with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with HER-2/neu
369 to 377 for 7 d. The CD8pos T cells were then harvested and either stained with 369 to 377 tetramer plus anti-CD8 counterstain, or cocultured with T2 cells
pulsed with either 369-377 peptide or irrelevant control peptides, or cocultured with tumor cells that expressed HER-2/neu but were either HLA-A2pos or HLA-A2neg, with
IFN-g secretion read by ELISA as an index of T-cell recognition. Results are from subjects 08102-06 and 08102-10 that had cells available to do this analysis and the
results were similar.

most patients, there was a marked postvaccination increase in
lymphocytic infiltration with cells congregating at periductal sites
surrounding regions of residual DCIS (Fig. 5A). The infiltrate
consisted largely of CD4pos T cells and CD20pos B cells with few
CD8pos T cells (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S3) and minimal or
no natural killer cells, macrophages, or dendritic cells detected.
Some lymphocytes (CD45ROpos and CD4pos) seemed to enter the

ducts and comingle with the tumor cells (Fig. 5A, bottom). There
was little evidence of Foxp3pos cells in the breast either prevaccine
or postvaccine, suggesting these negative regulatory cells play little
role in DCIS (Fig. 5A, bottom).
We then compared HER-2/neu expression before and after
vaccination to determine whether apparent immune pressure
altered target antigen expression on remaining tumor cells.

HER-2/ neu–Pulsed DC1 for Treatment of DCIS

We observed pronounced declines in HER-2/neu staining in 7 of 11
subjects compared with no decline in an unvaccinated control group
of HER-2/neu–overexpressing DCIS patients that also underwent an
initial biopsy before definitive surgical resection (Fig. 5B). In three
subjects who exhibited loss of HER-2/neu, confirmatory fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was done to test residual HER-2/
neu gene amplification. For two of these three, FISH analysis
confirmed the loss of HER-2/neu initially shown by immunohistochemistry, but the third (08102-06) remained strongly FISH positive
(data not shown).
Microcalcifications, formed within areas of high-grade comedonecrosis DCIS and visualized by mammography, can predict the
minimum extent of DCIS (actual tumors often extend beyond

microcalcifications) with a positive predictive value of 0.9 (18–20).
We used microcalcifications to estimate the extent of disease and
confirmed these findings with MRI. For 6 of the 11 (55%) patients
with microcalcifications, the actual tumor removed at the time of
definitive surgery was significantly smaller (>50% smaller) than the
area predicted by microcalcifications on postbiopsy mammograms
(Fig. 5C), suggesting tumor regression. Notably, five of these
seven subjects were among the seven shown to have decreased
HER-2/neu staining on residual tumor cells (exception, 08102-06
no decrease in extent; 08102-14 no calcification). Examples of this
loss visualized by immunohistochemical staining are shown
for subjects 08102-02 and 08102-09 (Fig. 6A). For subject 08102-09,
there was decreased staining intensity plus a postvaccination

the presence of CD4pos, CD8pos, and CD20pos cells. In addition, CD45RO and CD4 stains are shown from postvaccination tissues for patient 08102-09. Note the
evidence of CD4pos T cells surrounding the duct and also infiltrating a duct with residual high-grade DCIS. A table summarizing the lymphocytic infiltrates from the
first ten patients is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. B, expression of HER-2/neu on DCIS cells before and after vaccination. HER-2/neu staining was done on
prevaccine biopsy specimens as well as on the surgical specimen following vaccination. As a control, we stained initial biopsy and definitive surgical specimens from
patients with DCIS that were not vaccinated but obtained contemporaneously with this trial. The results are the comparisons of the HER-2/neu expression at the
time of definitive surgery compared with the HER-2/neu staining at the time of diagnosis. C, comparison of the area of microcalcifications on mammography after biopsy
with the largest area of DCIS obtained at the time of surgery. Colored dots, correlate with the patient ID from HER-2/neu expression in (B ). Note patients 08102-02,
08102-03, 08102-05, 08102-09, and 08102-12 showed both decreased HER-2/neu expression and a 50% or greater diminishment in the predicted size of the DCIS.
The area of microcalcifications was read by single mammographer. Areas of DCIS seen as mammographic microcalcifications were also verified by breast MRI.

Figure 6. Vaccination alters HER-2/neu expression and induces complement-fixing antibodies that bind to tumor in vivo. A, HER-2/neu expression before and after
vaccination from patients 08102-02 and 08102-09. Patient 08102-02 shows 60% 2pos HER-2/neu staining before vaccination with additional immunohistochemical
evidence of estrogen receptor expression. After vaccination, there was no evidence of HER-2/neu staining on any residual DCIS, and the remaining DCIS is cribriform
with estrogen receptor staining (data not shown). Patient 08102-09 showed diminished HER-2/neu staining with evidence of altered distribution concentrated in
vacuoles. B, postvaccination serum from six of nine patients tested shows an increase in complement-fixing antibodies after vaccination. Serum obtained before and
after vaccination were stored frozen and then added at dilutions ranging from 1:6 to 1:24 to cultures of either HER-2/neu pos or HER-2/neu neg breast cancer lines
and guinea pig complement was then added for 2 to 3 h. After 4 h, 15 AL WST1 was added to the wells. The plates were analyzed by an ELISA reader at 3 and
4.5 h afterwards at a wavelength of 450. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was also used at 1:6 to 1:240 dilutions. The percentage cytotoxicity was calculated as described in
Materials and Methods. C, evidence of vaccine-induced IgG bound to tumor in vivo . DCIS specimens obtained before and after vaccination from patient 08102-09
were treated with antihuman IgG. In prevaccine samples, there was minimal evidence of antihuman IgG staining (brown staining ), except in necrotic cells in the duct;
however, postvaccine, there was evidence of over 50% of ductal cells staining with antihuman Ig. Cells were counterstained with H&E staining (blue staining ).

compared with the uniform 3+ membrane staining in the prevaccine
biopsy (Fig. 6A).
DC1 vaccines induce complement-dependent antibodymediated cell cytotoxicity. The presence of DCIS trafficking B
cells and IFN-g–secreting T cells prompted us to assess the activity
of prevaccine and postvaccine sera in a complement-dependent,
tumor-lytic assay (Fig. 6B). Postvaccine serum from six of the nine
available subjects showed elevated complement-dependent in vitro
lysis of HER-2/neu pos but not HER-2/neu pos tumor cell lines. It
is notable that four of these six subjects (08102-02, 08102-03, 0810205, and 08102-09) were among the subjects displaying decreased
HER-2/neu staining and smaller areas of DCIS than predicted by
areas of microcalcifications. Subject 08102-11 did not develop
peritumoral lymphocytic infiltrates despite the presence of serum
antibody. In contrast, the anti-HER-2/neu antibody-based therapeutic agent trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech, Inc., South San
Francisco, CA; refs. 21–30) did not induce complement-mediated
lysis of HER-2/neu–expressing breast cancer cells (Fig. 6B).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

We next did immunohistochemistry staining to determine
whether the endogenously produced antibody actually bound
to tumor in vivo. Here, prevaccine and postvaccine DCIS samples
from one subject (08102-09) with residual high-grade HER-2/neu–
expressing DCIS were stained with antihuman IgG. We found
minimal evidence of IgG bound to tumor before vaccination,
but after vaccination, DCIS cells showed strong anti-IgG staining
(Fig. 6C). This shows that endogenous and, apparently, vaccineinduced antibodies bind directly to tumor targets, consistent with
a breaking of tolerance. These data further suggest that some of
the apparent loss of HER-2/neu staining could be a result
of competition from the patients’ own antibody. However, these
complement-fixing antibodies may also represent a tumor
rejection mechanism predicted by HER-2/neu transgenic mouse
models (31–36).

Discussion
Although definitive conclusions cannot yet be drawn, loss of
HER-2/neu expression and apparent tumor regression for DCIS

HER-2/ neu–Pulsed DC1 for Treatment of DCIS

suggests a potential for HER-2/neu DC1 vaccines to improve
prognosis and act as adjuncts to breast-conserving surgical
strategies. Our method was structured to deliver antigen-pulsed,
polarized DC1, such that IL-12p70 bursts coincided with in vivo
T-cell encounters in the lymph nodes. The initial IL-12 burst was
triggered by an exposure to a TLR agonist, which preconditioned
dendritic cell preparations for a delayed IL-12 burst if CD40
ligation was done up to 36 h later (Fig. 1D). This delayed IL-12
burst in vitro suggests that initial exposure to TLR agonists
in vivo, followed by later CD40 ligation ( from activated CD4pos
CD40Lpos helper T cells), may reflect a physiologic signaling
sequence that either licenses repetitive IL-12 production from the
same population of dendritic cells (thereby postponing dendritic
cells exhaustion; ref. 7) or recruits a second population of
dendritic cells that did not participate in the initial round of IL-12
secretion. Whatever the precise mechanism, the strategic preconditioning of such clinically desirable DC1 events may
contribute substantially to subsequent dendritic cells performance.
In the preliminary evaluation of this trial, our vaccination
strategy resulted in induction of CD4pos IFN-gpos Th1 cells,
peritumoral lymphocytic infiltrates (B cells and CD4pos and CD8pos
T cells), complement-dependent tumor-lytic antibodies, and
measurable reductions in DCIS. Previous studies have linked
lymphocytic tumor infiltrates with better prognosis (37, 38) and
HER-2/neu transgenic mouse models have elucidated the roles of
B cells (antibody) and CD4pos T cells (with less role for CD8pos
CTL) in tumor rejection (32, 33). It is remarkable, however, that
these changes, including clinically apparent reductions in DCIS
for half the subjects, were induced in little over 4 weeks by a welltolerated, weekly DC1 vaccination regimen. Interestingly, antibody
bound directly to tumor (indicating an in vivo breakdown of
tolerance) could be shown after vaccination, although whether
the role of tumor-trafficking B cells is to locally increase antibody
concentration or to serve as APC is yet to be determined.
For therapeutic cancer vaccines, breaking tolerance is essential,
especially because active mechanisms seem to be in place to
dampen immunity even at the early DCIS stage. For example,
peptide- and tumor-reactive CD8pos T cells from healthy donors
could be sensitized against HER-2/neu peptides in a single round of
in vitro stimulation (6), but T cells from prevaccine DCIS patients
could not (Fig. 2C). Prevaccine HER-2/neu tetramerpos T cells
also expressed relatively high levels of CTLA-4 (associated with

inhibitory signaling) and comparatively low levels of CD28
(activation signaling). After vaccination, this ratio inverted, and
peptide- and tumor-reactive T cells were easily expanded from
peripheral blood (as with healthy donors). Interestingly, we have
shown previously that IL-12 production by dendritic cells radically
enhances functional avidity and tumor-killing capacity of CD8pos
cells (6). Therefore, expression ratios for CD28 and CTLA-4 may
reflect yet another mechanism by which CD8pos T-cell peripheral
tolerance is regulated.
The preliminary results of this trial suggest that a focus on
combined early disease settings and neoadjuvant therapy may have
therapeutic effect, as well as permit meaningful study of
modulations in cellular trafficking, tolerance, and changes in
tumor antigen expression as a consequence of vaccination. Indeed,
the selection of tumor vaccine antigens based on their role in the
development and maintenance of disease may be of critical
importance (39–45). The immune system has been shown naturally
to sculpt characteristics of emerging tumors during carcinogenesis,
supplying a natural selective force that eliminates more immunogenic phenotypes. This process, termed ‘‘immunoediting’’ (46, 47),
may slow tumor growth initially but, in the long run, probably
causes less immunogenic, more aggressive tumors. The approach
of DC1 vaccination for HER-2/neu pos early breast cancer could
have the potential to reverse this course by purposefully and
selectively targeting the more aggressive HER-2/neu pos phenotype.
This strategy may therefore be considered ‘‘targeted immunoediting.’’ Further investigations using the general methods and
strategies examined in this study are warranted, both in patients
with more advanced breast cancer and in patients with other
malignancies.
