Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is the most common human sarcoma and is primarily
defined by activating mutations in the KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases1,2. KIT is highly
expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs)—the presumed cell of origin for GIST—as well as in

hematopoietic stem cells, melanocytes, mast cells and germ cells2,3. Yet, families harbouring
germline activating KIT mutations and mice with knock-in Kit mutations almost exclusively
develop ICC hyperplasia and GIST4–7, suggesting that the cellular context is important for KIT to
mediated oncogenesis. Here we show that the ETS family member ETV1 is highly expressed in the
subtypes of ICCs sensitive to oncogenic KIT mediated transformation8, and is required for their
development. In addition, ETV1 is universally highly expressed in GISTs and is required for
growth of imatinib-sensitive and resistant GIST cell lines. Transcriptome profiling and global
analyses of ETV1-binding sites suggest that ETV1 is a master regulator of an ICC-GIST-specific
transcription network mainly through enhancer binding. The ETV1 transcriptional program is
further regulated by activated KIT, which prolongs ETV1 protein stability and cooperates with
ETV1 to promote tumourigenesis. We propose that GIST arises from ICCs with high levels of
endogenous ETV1 expression that, when coupled with an activating KIT mutation, drives an
oncogenic ETS transcription program. This differs from other ETS-dependent tumours such as
prostate cancer, melanoma, and Ewing sarcoma where genomic translocation or amplification
drives aberrant ETS expression9–11 and represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic transcription
factor activation.

Reasoning that transcription factors are likely to play critical roles in defining the cellular
context, we utilized three expression datasets12,13 to search for GIST specific genes that
might provide new molecular insights. We identified an eleven-gene signature exclusively
associated with GIST in all three datasets that included the ETS family transcription factor
ETV1 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1). Examination of individual tumour samples revealed
that ETV1 is highly expressed in all GISTs and at significantly higher levels than any other
tumour type (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1). ETV1 was of immediate interest since ETS
family transcription factors are well established oncogenes in Ewing sarcoma, melanoma,
and prostate cancer9–11.

Next, we assessed mRNA and protein levels of ETV1 in GIST and other sarcomas in
clinical samples, GIST cell lines (imatinib-resistant GIST48 and imatinib-sensitive
GIST882), the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line, and the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line known
to overexpress ETV1 due to translocation14 (Fig. 1c, d). ETV1 mRNA and protein were
highly and exclusively expressed in all GISTs and GIST cell lines, and in LNCaP cells. As
expected, KIT mRNA and protein were highly expressed in all GIST tumours and GIST cell
lines, but not in other sarcomas or non-GIST cell lines, and phospho-KIT was only seen in
GIST samples with activating KIT mutations. Four additional GIST samples amenable to
immunohistochemical analysis all showed strong nuclear ETV1 staining whereas a
leiomyosarcoma control sample did not (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data show that ETV1
is universally highly expressed in all GISTs both at transcript and protein levels.
To explore the requirement of ETV1 in GIST pathogenesis, we performed RNAi
experiments using two ETV1-specific hairpins validated for both protein and mRNA
suppression (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Infection with either hairpin resulted in growth
inhibition of both GIST cell lines, but did not affect the growth of U2OS cells. Consistent
with the level of ETV1 knockdown, ETV1sh2 was more growth suppressive than ETV1sh1
in both GIST cell lines (Fig. 1e). Cell cycle analysis showed that ETV1 knockdown resulted

in both decreased cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
ETV1 knockdown also impaired the tumourigenicity of GIST882 cells in SCID mouse
xenografts, and those tumours that did grow had escaped ETV1suppression (Fig. 1f).
Collectively, these observations indicate that ETV1 is required for GIST growth and
survival.

Next, we addressed the mode of high ETV1 expression in GIST. FISH on 4 GIST samples
and 2 GIST cell lines showed no evidence of amplification or “breakaway” between the 3′
and 5′ ends of ETV1 locus. qRT-PCR showed no evidence of differential exon expression,
which is expected with ETV1 translocation (Supplementary Fig. 4). Furthermore, no focal
ETV1 amplification was found in 40 GIST tumours and 6 GIST cell lines in a recent 250K
SNP array study15. The fact that high levels of ETV1 expression are consistently observed
in the absence of obvious genomic alterations raises the possibility that the ICCs that give
rise to GIST may endogenously express ETV1.

The musculature of the GI tract is organized into two principal layers—the inner circular
muscle (CM) layer beneath the mucosa (M) and the outer longitudinal muscle (LM) layer16.
In the large intestine, myenteric ICCs (ICC-MY) form a network between the CM and LM
layers surrounding the neuronal myenteric plexus, intramuscular ICCs (ICC-IM) are singly
dispersed in the CM, and submucosal ICCs (ICC-SMP) form network surrounding the
submucosal plexus (Fig. 2a). In the small intestine, ICC-IMs and ICC-SMPs are absent and
ICC-DMPs form a network around the deep muscular plexus in the CM close to the mucosa
(Supplementary Fig. 5a). All four ICC subtypes are identified by positive membrane
expression of Kit16 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5b). In the large intestine, ICC-MYs
and ICC-IMs but not ICC-SMPs stain with nuclear Etv1 (Fig. 2b). In the small intestine,
ICC-MYs but not ICC-DMPs stain with nuclear Etv1 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). This finding
is further supported by our analysis of a published ICC expression dataset from mouse small
intestine17 showing that Etv1 is only highly expressed in ICC-MYs (Supplementary Fig.
5c). Notably, in the KitΔ558 mutant mice only ICC-MY and ICC-IM develop hyperplasia
while ICC-SMP and ICC-DMP do not8. These data suggest that ETV1 is a lineage-specific
transcription factor for the ICCs that give rise to GIST.

Author Manuscript

We therefore asked if Etv1 is required for the normal development of ICCs by examining
the GI tracts of Etv1−/− mice18. Cross section and reconstructed whole-mount images from
Etv1−/− mice showed significant loss of Kit-positive ICC-IMs and ICC-MYs in the large
intestine (Fig. 2c–d, Supplementary Fig. 9, Supplementary Movies 1–2), small intestine,
stomach, and cecum (Supplementary Figs. 6–9, Supplementary Movies 3–8). In contrast,
ICC-DMPs and ICC-SMPs in the small and large intestine respectively were preserved,
consistent with absent Etv1 expression in these ICC subtypes. These results were confirmed
with a second ICC marker Ano119 (Supplementary Fig. 10). Immunostaining with the
neuronal marker PGP9.5 confirmed the integrity of the myenteric plexus in Etv1−/− mice
(Fig. 2c, Supplemental Figs. 6–8, 11). Collectively, these data indicate that Etv1 is
selectively required for development of ICC-MY and ICC-IM and, by implication, a
lineage-specific survival factor for the ICC-GIST lineage.

To identify ETV1 target genes in GIST, we analyzed the effect of shRNA-mediated ETV1
suppression on the transcriptomes of GIST48 and GIST882 cells. The overlap of genes
perturbed by both ETV1-specific hairpins and across both cell lines was highly statistically
significant, suggesting that ETV1 regulates a core set of genes in GIST (Supplementary Fig.
12). To minimize cell line-specific and off-target effects, we generated a ranked gene list
based on the average change in gene expression induced by the two ETV1-specific hairpins
in both GIST cell lines (Fig. 3a, b). We independently confirmed downregulation of 5 of
these genes using real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 13). Among the 48 genes
suppressed >1.7-fold by ETV1 knockdown, 32 were expressed at higher levels in human
GIST samples relative to other tumour types in the ExpO expression dataset (Fig. 3b). We
performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)20 of the “shETV1” ranked list using
>3,000 gene sets in the Molecular Signature Database along with 5 custom gene sets defined
by GIST-signature genes from the Segal, Nielsen, and ExpO datasets and by ICC-MY- and
ICC-DMP-signature genes (Supplementary Table 1). All three GIST sets along with the
ICC-MY set were among the most negatively enriched gene sets while the ICC-DMP set
was not (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 14, and Supplementary Table 2). These data suggest
that ETV1 is a master regulator of a transcriptional program conserved in ICC-IM/MYs and
GISTs.

To define the direct transcriptional targets of ETV1 in GIST, we performed genome-wide
analyses of ETV1-binding sites using ChIP-Seq in GIST48 cells. We identified 14,741
ETV1-binding sites (ETV1 peaks) which are enriched in promoter regions (Fig. 3d). Motif
analysis of the peaks identified the ETS core consensus motif, GGAA, in ~90% of peaks
(Fig. 3f). Integrative analyses of the ETV1 ChIP-Seq data with the transcriptomes from
shRNA-mediated ETV1 suppression in GIST cells showed that 38 of the top 48 shETV1
downregulated genes contain ETV1 peaks (Fig. 3b, e, Supplementary Fig. 15). Analysis of
genes with 1.4-fold change by shETV1 knockdown revealed that both shETV1 upregulated
and shETV1 downregulated genes are enriched for ETV1 peaks. Furthermore, enhancer
binding and in particular enhancer and promoter binding is highly predicative of
transcriptional activation by ETV1 (Fig. 3h). Since enhancers are in general cell-lineage
specific21,22, our data suggest that these ICC-GIST-lineage specific genes are likely
directly regulated by ETV1 binding to their enhancer regulatory elements.

Author Manuscript

The dual requirement of KIT and ETV1 in normal ICC development and GIST survival raise
the possibility that KIT and ETV1 cooperate in GIST oncogenesis. Inhibition of KIT
signalling by imatinib in imatinib-sensitive GIST882 cells resulted in rapid loss of ETV1
protein, without significant effect on ETV1 mRNA levels (Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Fig.
16). Similar results were observed with the MEK inhibitor PD325901. This loss of ETV1
protein was faster than the natural degradation rate, as revealed by cyclohexamide
experiments to inhibit protein synthesis, and was rescued from proteosomal degradation by
MG132 (Fig. 4b). Therefore, KIT-MEK signalling stabilizes ETV1 protein. Consistent with
this KIT-MEK-ETV1 signalling pathway model, the overlap between genes transcriptionally
altered by imatinib treatment (KIT-regulated) and by ETV1 knockdown in GIST882 cells is
highly significant (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, these ETV1 transcriptional targets preferentially

contain ETV1 enhancer peaks (Fig. 4d), indicating that KIT signalling influences the ETV1
transcriptional output of the tissue and lineage-specific genes in GIST.
Having established a signalling pathway from KIT to ETV1, we explored their potential
cooperativity in tumourigenesis by expressing ETV1, wild-type KIT, KIT harbouring a
common GIST mutation (KITΔ560) and control vectors in combination in NIH3T3 cells.
KIT-dependent stabilization of ETV1 protein was recapitulated in this system (Fig. 4e). In
anchorage independent colony formation assays, ETV1 significantly increased the number
and size of colonies in KITΔ560 expressing cells but was insufficient to confer anchorageindependent growth on its own (Supplementary Fig. 17). Furthermore, KITΔ560 and ETV1
strongly cooperated in conferring tumourigenic growth in SCID mice (Fig. 4f, g).

Author Manuscript

Taken together, these findings establish an oncogenic role for ETV1 in GIST that differs
from classical models of ETS-driven malignancies where structural alterations (e.g.,
TMPRSS2-ETV1 translocation in prostate cancer, ETV1 amplification in melanoma) lead to
aberrant expression and promote tumourigenesis9,11. Rather, ETV1 expression in GIST is
inherited from ICC-MY/IM cells, where ETV1 is also a survival factor. We further
established that KIT activity, through MEK, stabilizes ETV1, providing a mechanism for
KIT-ETV1 cooperativity (Fig. 4h). These observations provide an explanation for why
patients and mice with germline activating KIT mutations develop neoplasia in only the
ICC-MY/IM lineage. While the mechanism of ETV1-mediated oncogenesis in GIST differs
from other ETS-driven cancers, we anticipate that the ETV1-dependent transcriptional
program defined here may serve as a valuable resource for further understanding of other
ETV1- and other ETS-driven transcriptional programs in various cellular contexts such as
prostate cancer.

Author Manuscript

The fact that ETV1 is universally highly expressed in all GISTs makes it immediately useful
as a candidate diagnostic biomarker, since the current standard of KIT immunoreactivity is
negative in about 5% of all GISTs23. While transcription factors has classically been
considered “undruggable”, reports of successful inhibition of the NOTCH transcription
factor complex and AR activity by blocking coactivator binding have challenged this
paradigm24,25. Due to established requirements of ETV1 in subsets of prostate cancer and
melanoma, efforts to find ETV1 inhibitors are underway and may yield novel therapeutic
agents for imatinib-resistant GIST.

Methods Summary
Expression data mining, microarray analysis and ChIP-Seq

Author Manuscript

All mined datasets were downloaded Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE2109, GSE7809,
GSE2719, GSE3443, GSE8167, GSE17743) and were analyzed by Oncomine™ or using
Genespring 10. GIST-signature genes from three datasets containing both GIST and nonGIST malignancies met the following two criteria: 1) q<0.05, and 2) a Z-score expression
difference >1.5 between GIST and non-GIST tumours. Expression profiling of GIST cell
lines with different shRNA conditions was performed in duplicate on Illumina Human
HT-12 array. GSEA was performed using MSigDB C2, MSigDB C4, and the GIST and ICC
signature gene sets. For ChIP-Seq, sheared chromatin enriched by ETV1 IP was sequenced

a, Ranked list of ETV1 regulated genes was generated based on the average fold-change by
the two ETV1 hairpins in two cell lines. b, Heatmap of expression of the 48 genes with
average downregulation >1.7-fold. For each gene, table shows p-value of GIST vs. other
tumour types from the ExpO dataset, calculated by Oncomine™ (NS: p>0.05), and the
presence of ETV1 binding sites from ChIP-Seq analysis. c, GSEA plots of the shETV1
ranked list using three gene sets: GIST signature genes from ExpO dataset, ICC-MY and
ICC-DMP signature genes in mouse small intestine. ES, enrichment score; FDR, false
discovery rate. d, Pie charts of genomic structure and distribution of ETV1 ChIP-Seq peaks.
TSS, transcription start site; TES, transcription end site. e, Representative ChIP-Seq reads in
top ETV1 target genes. f, The consensus sequence motif identified in the ETV1 binding sites
by the MEME program. g, Pie chart of genes with ETV1 binding sites divided into promoter

a, Immunoblots of GIST882 cells treated with the imatinib (1 μM) and PD325901 (100 nM)
for the indicated time points. b, Immunoblots of GIST882 cells treated for 2 hours with
imatinib or PD325901 in combination with cyclohexamide (10 μg/ml) or MG132 (10 μM).
c, Venn diagram of genes downregulated by 1.4-fold by shETV1 and by imatinib in
GIST882 cells. P-value: Fisher’s exact test based on number of expressed genes. d, Percent
of all genes, imatinib-downregulated genes, shETV1-downregulated genes, and overlapping
genes with ETV1 enhancer peaks. e, Immunoblot of NIH3T3 cells expressing ETV1 and
either KITwt or KITΔ560 two hours after treatment with PD325901, imatinib, or MG132. f,
Growth of xenografts of engineered NIH3T3 cells stabilizing the indicated genes (n=12,
Mean ±SEM). g, Photograph of 4 representative explanted xenografts at 4 weeks after
implanting. Scale bar 1 cm. h, Model of the role of ETV1 in ICC maintenance and GIST
oncogenesis. Normal level of KIT activation by KIT ligand (red triangle) stabilizes ETV1
transcription factor through the MAPK pathway, and results in physiological ETV1
transcriptional output critical for ICC development (middle). In the absence of ETV1, there
is decreased ICC development, which phenocopies genetic loss of KIT signalling (left).
Activating mutation of KIT (e.g. KITΔ560) leads to constitutive activation of the KIT-
