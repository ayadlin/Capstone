ABSTRACT
The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide is highly effective against newly
diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM), but serious and even
fatal infections have been associated with its use. In this meta-analysis, we assessed
the overall risk of infection to MM patients treated with lenalidomide. Eleven phase
II or III clinical trials, comprising 3,210 subjects, were selected from the Embase,
Pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases, from the Clinical Trial Registration website,
and from meeting abstracts and virtual presentations at the American Society of
Clinical Oncology. Main outcome measures were overall incidence, relative risk
(RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of reported infection events. Fixed-effect
or random-effect models were used in the statistical analyses, depending on the
between-study heterogeneity. The overall incidence of high-grade infection was
14.32% (95% CI: 12.08%-16.90%) and high-grade infection’s pooled RR was
2.23 (95% CI: 1.71-2.91, P < 0.0001) for all 11 studies evaluated. No evidence of
publication bias for the incidence of high-grade infection was detected using Begg’s
funnel plot and Egger’s test (P = 0.2; 95% CI: -1.70, 1.23). From this meta-analysis, it
appears lenalidomide use is associated with an increased risk of high-grade infection.
Moreover, fatal infection events occurred only in patients treated with lenalidomide;
no infection-related deaths were observed among controls. These data indicate that
accurate diagnosis and optimal management of infection in MM patients treated with
lenalidomide could be critical for treatment efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

MM [2, 3] [4]. However, significant toxicity such as
myelosuppression, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and
moderate or serious infections, are commonly associated
with its use. At present, it remains unclear to what extent
treatment of MM with lenalidomide might be related to
an increased risk of serious, potentially fatal, infections.
Lenalidomide is a structural analogue of thalidomide
that exhibits much higher pharmacological activity [5].
The development of diverse infection events in patients
receiving lenalidomide was reported in several clinical
trials [6, 7]. As infection event data from many of such
trials are rather limited, the difficulties that generally

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological
malignancy characterized by clonal proliferation of
neoplastic plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). The 10year survival rate for patients with MM is approximately
30%, and more than 11,000 deaths occur every year in the
United States due to this disease [1]. In combination with
dexamethasone, the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide
has shown to improve clinical responses such as objective
response rate, survival, and time to progression in patients
with either newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory

emerge from the analysis and interpretation of sparse
adverse event data apply to evaluating the relevance of
lenalidomide-related infections in MM therapy. As a
consequence, the risk of serious or even fatal infection
remains a concern, and hence closely monitoring infection
symptoms is critically important upon initiation of
lenalidomide therapy in patients with MM. When poorly
managed, these may lead to fervescence, red swollen,
ulceration with cave formation and even death. To assess
the extent and magnitude of this problem, and to help
guide treatment decisions, the incidence and relative risk
of infection among MM patients receiving lenalidomide
were evaluated in this meta-analysis.

characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The studies
reviewed included three phase II trials [2, 4, 8] and eight
phase III trials [3, 6, 7, 9-13], and all of subjects received
lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Regarding study
locations, six were from North America [4, 6-8, 10, 12],
two from Greece [3, 9], and one each from France [11],
Italy [13], and China [2]. The quality of the 11 studies
was roughly evaluated in line with the Jadad scale: three
studies had scores of 5 [7, 9, 11] four studies had scores of
4 [6, 10, 12, 13] and four studies had scores of 3 [2-4, 8]
Score details for each study are shown in Table 1.
This meta-analysis was performed in accordance
with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
Statement (see the supplementary material in Appendix
A1).

RESULTS
Search results and trial characteristics

Overall incidence of high-grade/fatal infection

Of the 1,632 potentially relevant studies yielded
by our initial search, 1,621 were excluded per our
review criteria (Figure 1). The remaining 11 studies [24, 6-13] included 3,210 subjects which met our inclusion
criteria, and these were then available for analysis. Their

A total of 1,984 subjects from 11 studies [2-4, 6-13]
were available for high-grade infection incidence analysis.
High-grade infection events were reported in all studies,
and incidence ranged from 6.94% to 21.47%. The highest
incidence of infection was observed in a phase III trial

in the US [7], in which all subjects were confirmed for
progressive MM. Based on data from each study, the
calculated overall incidence of high-grade infection was
14.32% (95% CI: 12.08%-16.90%) (Figure 2) according to
the random-effects model (P = 0.02; I2 = 52.3%).
Fatal infection events were reported in two out of
11 studies, and incidence ranged from 0.43% to 1%. One
occurred in a phase III trial from Greece [3], and the other
in a phase III trial from the US [12]. Both fatal infection
events occurred in patients treated with lenalidomide.

9-13] were included in the RR analysis. Treatment with
lenalidomide significantly increased the risk of developing
high-grade infection (pooled RR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.712.91, P < 0.0001) (Figure 3), according to the fixed-effects
model (P = 0.5135, I2 = 0%). The highest RR for any
study was 3.51 (95% CI: 1.86-6.62) (Figure 3), and it was
observed in a phase III study from the US [12].

Relative risk of high-grade/fatal infection

No evidence of publication bias for the incidence of
high-grade infection was found in our meta-analysis, as
determined by funnel plot (Figure 4) and Egger’s test (P =
0.2; 95% CI: -1.70-1.23).

Publication bias

To evaluate the specific contribution of lenalidomide
to the development of infection in MM patients, we
evaluated the relative-risk (RR) of high-grade infection
in lenalidomide and control groups after exclusion of
confounding factors such as disease history and course.

DISCUSSION
Infection is a major cause of mortality in patients
with MM. Although stem cell transplantation and most
46596

novel anti-MM drugs increase the risk of infection,
particularly during relapsed/refractory MM treatments,
the risk posed by lenalidomide may be in this regard
among the highest [14, 15]. Therefore, it is vital for the
medical practitioner and patients to understand the risk of
infection for optimization of treatment and management
of this adverse event. Since available data is still scanty,
we conducted this study to assess the risk and incidence of
infection in MM patients receiving lenalidomide.
As far as we know, this is the largest meta-analysis
to specifically assess the infection risk of lenalidomide in
MM patients. We analyzed data from 3,210 patients with
MM included in 11 clinical trials . The overall incidence
of high-grade infection associated with lenalidomide in
MM patients was 14.32% (highest incidence = 21.47%;
lowest incidence = 6.94%). The pooled RR of developing
high-grade infection was 2.23 (highest RR = 3.51). Fatal
infection events occurred in two trials [3, 12] and only in
patients treated with lenalidomide.
Usually, the incidence of infection is the highest in
the initial months of drug treatment and in the last stage
of the disease’s progression [16, 17]; also, the incidence
is lower in patients who have responded to treatment
[14, 18]. Common clinical complications of MM patients
that increase the risk of infection are neutropenia,
neurodegenerative disease, kidney failure, fractures and
other disease- and treatment-related comorbidities [19,
20]. Importantly, infection can lead to dose reduction
or treatment discontinuation in the clinical management
of MM. Our findings are significant in that that they
indicate that the incidence of high-grade infection was
twice as high in MM patients receiving lenalidomide
than in controls. Therefore, preventive management and
continued monitoring of infection symptoms are essential
for MM patients receiving lenalidomide.
Lenalidomide-induced infections are difficult to
accurately diagnose, and fever should be considered one
of the manifestations of infection in MM patients until
proved to be caused by other factors [21]. Examination
of an infection traditionally starts with investigating the
spectrum of causative agents in relation to current and
past therapies and specific disease stages. The key to
the optimal management of infection is using diagnostic
tools to identify pathogens and applying antibacterial or
antiviral treatment according to local epidemiological
trends [15]. Otherwise, infection presents a clinical
challenge for patients with MM, and the presence of
various larvaceous pathogens is often persistent during
the course of the disease [22]. Thus, all MM patients
with lenalidomide-related infections should be carefully
monitored and receive cautious care from physicians.
The mechanisms by which lenalidomide increases
the risk of infection in MM patients remain unclear.
While confounding factors may stem from age-related
conditions, drug therapies, or the disease itself, MMrelated immunodeficiency affects diverse cell types
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and immunological pathways, including B-lymphocyte
dysfunction as well as functional abnormalities of natural
killer cells, dendritic cells and T-lymphocytes [23, 24].
Lenalidomide-related organ dysfunction, such as digestive
tract mucosa injury and lung and/or renal injury, may
indirectly increase the incidence of infection [25]. Lastly,
older patients suffering from chronic physical illnesses and
senile diseases are more susceptible to infection, and the
physician should be especially attentive to these patients.
Several limitations are present in our study. First,
this is a meta-analysis based on previous studies, not on
actual patient data. Thus, confounding variables, including
basic medication history and adjuvant therapy, could not
be considered in the analysis. Second, this meta-analysis
was done using data from patients with proper organ
functions, but the risk and prevalence of infection may be
higher in routine clinical practice [26]. Third, the studies
for this meta-analysis were performed at various types of
institutions by different researchers, and the evaluations
and conclusions may be heterogeneous [27].
In conclusion, our study showed that the incidence
of high-grade infection was higher in MM patients treated
with lenalidomide, and all fatal infection events occurred
in this group. Adverse event monitoring is important to
survey infections during lenalidomide treatment, and
accurate diagnosis and optimal management of infection
in MM patients is critical for safe medication prescription.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy
We searched PubMed (from 1967), Embase (from
1974), and the Cochrane Library electronic databases
through December 2016. Keywords included in the
search were lenalidomide, multiple myeloma, randomized
controlled trials, clinical trials, and controlled clinical
trials. We also searched the Clinical Trials Registry
website (ClinicalTrials.gov) to obtain information on
registered clinical trials (RCTs). Additionally, we searched
meeting abstracts and virtual presentations from the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO; http://
www.asco.org) up to 2015 for relevant RCTs. The search
was restricted to clinical trials and articles published in the
English language.

Study selection and quality assessment
Two investigators (ZJ and LY) assessed the
eligibility of the trials by independent search, and trials
were retrieved for further consideration if they were judged
pertinent by one or both investigators. Any discrepancies
were identified and resolved by consensus. Clinical trials
that met the following criteria were included:

Data extraction and clinical endpoints
Data extraction was performed by two investigators
(ZJ and LY) independently, and infection data were
extracted from the safety profile of all selected trials.
For each trial, the following information was extracted:
first author’s name, year of publication, trial’s phase,
patient ethnicity, number of patients in the lenalidomide
and control groups, and number of high-grade infection
events. Treatment-emergent adverse events were recorded
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute
(NCI).

Data analysis
Our analysis was performed according to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [29]. The
principal indices were incidence, relative risk (RR), and
corresponding 95% CIs of relevant infection events. To
calculate incidence, the number of subjects with highgrade (grades 3, 4 or 5) infection and the total number of
subjects treated with lenalidomide were extracted from the
safety profiles of the included trials. The proportion and
95% CI of subjects with infection were derived in each
trial, and the RR of infection was derived only in trials
with a control group in the same trial. For trials reporting
zero events in any group, we applied a classic half-integer
continuity correction to calculate the RR and variance [30].
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by using Cochran’s
Q statistic [31], and inconsistency was quantified with I2
tests among the included trials [32]. Heterogeneity was
considered statistically significant when P < 0.1 or I2 >
40%. If heterogeneity existed, the data was analyzed
using a random-effects model; if heterogeneity did not
exist, a fixed-effects model was used. A statistical test
with a P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
The presence of publication bias was estimated using the
Begg’s and Egger’s tests [33, 34]. All data analyses were
performed using R software, version 3.2.3 (The R Project
for Statistical Computing, http://www.r-project.org).
