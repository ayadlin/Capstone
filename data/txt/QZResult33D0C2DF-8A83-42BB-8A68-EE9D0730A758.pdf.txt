ABSTRACT
Emerging evidence demonstrates that platelet-derived growth factor-D (PDGF-D)
plays a critical role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the underlying mechanism has not
been fully elucidated. The objective is to explore the molecular mechanism of PDGFD-mediated EMT in drug resistance HCC cells. To achieve our goal, we used multiple
approaches including Western blotting, real-time RT-PCR, wound healing assay,
invasion assay, luciferase activity assay, transfection, and immunohistochemistry.
We found that PDGF-D is highly expressed in gemcitabine-resistant (GR) HCC cells.
Moreover, PDGF-D markedly inhibited miR-106a expression and subsequently
upregulated Twist1 expression. Notably, PDGF-D expression was associated with miR106a and Twist1 in HCC patients. Our findings provide a possible molecular mechanism
for understanding GR chemoresistance in HCC cells. Therefore, inactivation of PDGF-D/
Twist or activation of miR-106a could be a novel strategy for the treatment of HCC.

A line of evidence demonstrates that chemoresistance is associated with the acquisition of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells, leading
to enhanced metastasis [9]. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabineresistant (GR) HCC cells acquired EMT characteristics
[10]. It is known that during EMT, epithelial cells convert
into mesenchymal cells through losing epithelial cell-cell
junction and epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and
γ-catenin, and gaining the expression of mesenchymal
markers such as Twist, Vimentin, Snail, Slug, which lead
to increased migration and invasion. Notably, we identified
that platelet-derived growth factor-D (PDGF-D) signaling
pathway plays a critical role in the acquisition of EMT
phenotype of GR HCC cells [10]. Although PDGF-D
is critically involved in tumorigenesis [11], the exact
mechanism by which PDGF-D regulates EMT in GR cells
has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, identifying the

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of
commonly diagnosed malignancies [1]. Sorafenib,
the standard of care for patients with advanced HCC,
improved the median survival in advanced HCC;
however, the median overall survival is less than one year
[2, 3]. Several other drugs targeting signaling cascades
such as brivanib, sunitinib, erlotinib, and linifanib
encountered setbacks in clinical trials in advanced HCC
[4, 5]. Recently, infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) as palliative chemotherapy to
patients with advanced HCC conferred some benefit
[6]. Moreover, it has been shown that gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin are effective with manageable toxicity in
advanced HCC patients [7]. However, tumor cells acquire
resistance to these chemotherapeutic drugs, leading to
treatment failure and high mortality of HCC [8].

underlying mechanism of PDGF-D-mediated EMT could
be helpful to find novel strategy to treat HCC patients.
Emerging evidence has suggested that microRNAs
(miRNAs) play an important role in regulation of EMT
in HCC. It has been accepted that miRNAs elicit their
regulatory effects by binding to the 3’ untranslated region
(3’UTR) of target mRNA, resulting in the degradation of the
mRNA or translational inhibition of functional proteins. The
growing body of literature strongly suggests the essential
roles of miRNAs in EMT progresses in HCC. Zhang
et al. reported that miR-490-3p modulates EMT by targeting
endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment
protein 3 (ERGIC3) in HCC cells [12]. Similarly,
overexpression of miR-216a/217 induced EMT through
activation of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/Akt
and TGF-β (transforming growth factor, beta 1) pathways
by targeting PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog
deleted on chromosome ten) and SMAD7 (SMAD family
member 7), leading to contribution to tumor recurrence in
HCC [13]. Consistently, miR-612 was found to suppress
EMT through regulation of Akt2 in HCC [14]. Moreover,
miR-612 inhibited the stemness of HCC through targeting
Wnt/β-catenin signaling [15]. Furthermore, overexpression
of miR-106b triggered EMT and subsequently promoted cell
migration and metastasis in HCC [16]. These studies imply
that miRNAs govern EMT through regulation of their targets.
Recent studies have revealed that PDGF-D
crosstalks with miRNA [17, 18]. Specifically, PDGF-D
overexpression let to the acquisition of EMT phenotype
in prostate cancer cells consistent with the loss of miR200 expression, indicating that PDGF-D-induced EMT
is in part due to down-regulation of miR-200 expression
[17]. The goal of this study was to determine whether
PDGF-D mediated EMT through regulation of miRNAs
in HCC GR cells. In the current study, we reported that
PDGF-D/miR-106a/Twist pathway orchestrates EMT in
HCC GR cells. Our results further suggest that targeting
PDGF-D could be a novel strategy for the treatment of
HCC patients.

that Huh-7 GR cells obtained the specific EMT molecular
markers (Figure 1B).

Down-regulation of miR-106a in HCC GR cells
PDGF-D has been reported to be critically involved
in GR-mediated EMT [11], we measured the expression
of PDGF-D at mRNA and protein levels in HCC GR cells
by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Consistent
with our previous report [10], we observed a significantly
increased PDGF-D at both mRNA and protein levels in
HepG2 GR and Huh-7 GR cells (Figures 1C, 5B). It has
been known that miR-106a plays a pivotal role in drug
resistance [19]. Thus, we determine whether miR-106a
has changes in HCC GR cells compared with the parental
cells. Indeed, we observed the down-regulation of miR106a in both HepG2 GR and Huh-7 GR cells (Figure 1C).

PDGF-D regulates miR-106 expression
Next, we explored whether PDGF-D could regulate
the expression of miR-106a in HCC cells. To address this
question, we depleted PDGF-D by its specific siRNA
in HCC GR cells and up-regulated PDGF-D expression
using its cDNA plasmid in HCC cells. We observed that
PDGF-D siRNA significantly inhibited the expression
of PDGF-D in HCC GR cells, whereas PDGF-D cDNA
remarkably increased PDGF-D expression in HCC cells
(data not shown). Moreover, we found that miR-106a
was inhibited by PDGF-D cDNA transfection in HepG2
and Huh-7 cells (Figure 1D). On the contrary, miR-106a
was increased in HepG2 GR and Huh-7 GR cells after
depletion of PDGF-D (Figure 1D).

miR-106a inhibits cell migratory and invasive
activity in GR cells
It has been accepted that cells obtain enhanced
migration and invasion during EMT. To validate the role of
miR-106a in regulation of EMT, we conducted the woundhealing assay and invasion assay in HCC GR cells treated
with miR-106a mimic. As demonstrated in Figure 2A and 2B,
HepG2 GR and Huh-7 GR cells with miR-106a treatment
have significantly decreased numbers of cells migrating
across the wound. Moreover, miR-106a mimic inhibited cell
invasion in HCC GR cells compared with control miRNA
treatment (Figure 2C). Furthermore, we found that miR-106a
treatment suppressed the cell attachment and detachment in
both HepG2 GR and Huh-7 GR cells (Figure 2D).

RESULTS
HCC GR cells have EMT characteristics
Our previous study has shown that HepG2 GR
cells have EMT phenotype [10]. To further determine
whether Huh-7 GR cells could acquire EMT feature, we
developed Huh-7 GR cells (Figure 1A). As expected,
we observed that Huh-7 GR cells, like HepG2 GR cells,
had morphologic changes consistent with EMT. Huh-7
GR cells displayed elongated fibroblastic morphology
compared with Huh-7 parental cells with epithelial
cobblestone phenotype (Figure 1A). More importantly,
our RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed that
Huh-7 GR cells have low expression of E-cadherin and
high expression of Vimentin, Snail and Slug, suggesting

Twist1 is a downstream target of miR-106a
To further explore the molecular mechanism of
miR-106a-regulated EMT in HCC GR cells, we sought to
identify the target of miR-106a. According to the data from
three public algorithms including TargetScan, PicTar, and
miRanda, Twist1 could be a potential target of miR-106a.

Since Twist plays an essential role in EMT, we focused our
study on Twist1. Our results from RT-PCR demonstrated
that miR-106a mimic treatment caused down-regulation
of Twist1 in HCC GR cells, whereas miR-106a inhibitor
treatment led to up-regulation of Twist1 in HCC cells
(Figure 3A). Western blotting analysis also showed that
increased level of Twist1 was observed in HCC cells after
miR-106 inhibitor treatment (Figure 3B). Consistently, a
reduced level of Twist1 was found in HCC GR cells treated
with miR-106a mimic (Figure 3C). Further bioinformatics
analysis indicated that the Twist1 3’UTR harbors potential
miR-106a target sites (Figure 3C). To further verify the
Twist1 as a target of miR-106a, we performed reporter
assays in HCC cells with the luciferase gene driven by
either wild-type or mutated Twist1 3’UTR sequences
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 3C). Our results showed that it has a significant
reduction in luciferase activity with wild-type Twist1, but
not mutant Twist1, in HepG2 GR cells transfected with
miR-106a mimic (Figure 3D). In line with this, treatment
with miR-106a inhibitor resulted in increased luciferase
activity with wild-type Twist1 in HepG2 cells (Figure 3D).
Altogether, these findings support that miR-106a binds to
Twist1 and that Twist1 is a downstream target of miR-106a.

Down-regulation of Twist1 reverses EMT to
MET in GR cells
To determine whether Twist1 is involved in GRmediated EMT, we depleted the Twist1 using its specific
siRNA in HepG2 GR and Huh-7 GR cells. Then, we

performed the wound-healing assay and invasion assay in
HCC GR cells transfected with Twist1 siRNA. The woundhealing assay showed that depletion of Twist1 inhibited
cell migration in HCC GR cells (Figure 4A). In support of
this note, we also found that Twist1 siRNA treatment led to
inhibition of cell invasion (Figure 4B). Notably, our results
demonstrated that depletion of Twist1 suppressed the cell
detachment and attachment in HCC GR cells (Figure 4C).
Importantly, we observed that HepG2 GR and Huh-7 GR
cells transfected with Twist1 siRNA displayed round celllike morphology (data not shown). More importantly, our
RT-PCR results revealed that down-regulation of Twist1
decreased E-cadherin mRNA, but increased Vimentin mRNA
in HepG2 GR (Figure 4D) and Huh-7 GR (data not shown).
The Western blot analysis also confirmed that the expression
of E-cadherin was increased, while Vimentin expression was
decreased in HCC GR cells with Twist1 siRNA treatment
(Figure 4D). These results indicated that depletion of Twist1
led to the reversal of EMT to MET phenotype.

in HCC cells (Figure 5C). In contrast, depletion of PDGF-D
down-regulated Twist1 expression in HCC GR cells (Figure
5D). Taken together, our results suggest that PDGF-D could
govern Twist1 expression.

PDGF-D expression is associated with miR-106a
and Twist1 in HCC patients
To further define the physiological function
of PDGF-D and Twist1 in HCC, we measured their
expressions using immunohistochemical staining in 76
HCC patients. We found that sixty-nine of 76 (90%) HCC
were positive for PDGF-D protein expression, while 7
(10%) of the cases were negative (Figure 6A, 6C). We
also observed that 54 (71%) HCC patients had Twist1
expression. More importantly, PDGF-D expression was
significantly associated with Twist1 expression (Figure 6A,
6C). To investigate whether Twist1 was associated with
miR-106a expression in HCC patients, we detected the
miR-106 level in 76 HCC samples. We found a significant
association between Twist1 and miR-106a expression
(Figure 6D). Twist1 positive samples had low expression
of miR-106a, whereas Twist1 negative samples obtained
high expression of miR-106a (Figure 6D). To further
validate the relationship between PDGF-D and Twist1
expression in HCC, we randomly selected the 20 HCC
tissues and detected the PDGF-D and Twist1 levels by
Western blotting analysis. Consistent with the results from
immunohistochemical staining, we observed a correlation
between PDGF-D and Twist1 in HCC samples (Figure 6B).

PDGF-D controls Twist1 expression
We have found that PDGF-D regulates miR-106a
expression and Twist1 is a target of miR-106a. Thus, we
investigated whether PDGF-D controls Twist1 expression.
As we expected, increased Twist1 expression at mRNA and
protein levels were observed in HCC GR cells, which have
high expression of PDGF-D compared with parental HCC
cells (Figure 5A, 5B). In line with this finding, we found that
over-expression of PDGF-D up-regulated Twist1 expression

protein phosphatase)-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt
[25]. In support of role of miRNAs in EMT, miR-26b was
found to suppress EMT through targeting USP9X (ubiquitin
specific peptidase 9, X-linked) in HCC [26]. Recently, one
study revealed that miR-106a was implicated in ovarian
carcinoma-associated EMT [27]. In line with these findings,
we observed that miR-106a was increased in EMT-type
GR cells. Notably, miR-106a inhibited cell migratory and
invasive activity in GR cells. Our study provided a new
mechanism by which PDGF-D regulated EMT through
inhibition of miR-106a. It is noteworthy that PDGF-D
mediated EMT in prostate cancer cells partly through
repressing miR-200b [17]. Interestingly, we did not observe
any changes in miR-200b level in GR HCC cells (data
not shown), suggesting that miR-200b is not involved in
GR-mediated EMT in HCC cells.
Twist family has Twist1 and Twist2, which are two
distinct tissue-restricted transcription factors with high
sequence similarity. Twist family is critically involved
in governing EMT process [28]. It has been known that
Twist inhibited E-cadherin and triggered an EMT, leading
to tumor invasion and metastasis [29]. Consistently,
higher expression of Twist is correlated with tumor

DISCUSSION
The data presented here demonstrated that PDGF-D
mediated EMT through inhibition of miR-106a and
subsequent upregulation of Twist1 in HCC GR cells.
Recent studies have identified critical roles of miRNAs in
EMT processes. For example, miR-21 induced EMT due to
targeting both human sulfatase-1 and PTEN and subsequent
activation of Akt/Erk (extracellular regulated protein kinase)
pathways in HCC cells [20]. Similarly, miR-491 inhibited
EMT via modulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2/9 in HCC
cells [21]. In addition, miR-29a regulated TGF-β-induced
EMT through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferases in
HCC cells [22]. Moreover, it has been reported that miR148a suppressed EMT and cancer stem cells-like properties
by targeting Wnt1 (wingless-type MMTV integration
site family member 1) and Met, leading to inhibition of
metastasis of HCC [23, 24]. Furthermore, miR-331-3p
promotes EMT-mediated metastasis of HCC through the
inhibition of PHLPP (PH domain and leucine rich repeat

invasion and metastasis in breast cancer [29]. Moreover,
Twist was reported as a prognostic biomarker in certain
human cancers [28]. Strikingly, Twist has been found to
be critically involved in drug resistance. For example,
knockdown of Twist1 enhanced cell death induced by
arsenic trioxide- and ionizing radiation in lung cancer cells
[30]. Similarly, Twist1 knockdown sensitized prostate
cancer cells to docetaxel treatment [31]. In keeping with
this, Twist confers chemoresistance to anthracyclines by
uoregulation of P-glycoprotein in bladder cancer cells
[32]. Multiple studies have identified that some factors and
signaling pathways including HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible
factor-1) [33], SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator-1) [34],
STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)
[35, 36], F-box protein FBXL14 (F-box and leucine-rich
repeat protein 14) [37], β-TRCP (beta-transducin repeatcontaining protein) [38], and Notch1 [39] govern Twist
expression. Strikingly, accumulating evidence suggests
that miRNAs regulate Twist expression. For instance,
down-regulation of miR-214 promoted EMT by directly
targeting Twist gene in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
[40]. Long et al. reported that down-regulation of miR-138
promoted colorectal cancer metastasis through directly
targeting Twist2 [41]. Additionally, miR-181a modulated
EMT and metastatic potential through targeting Twist1 in
tongue squamous cell carcinoma [42]. Consistently, miR720 suppressed tumor migration and invasion and through
targeting Twist1 in breast cancer [43]. Furthermore,
miR-106b inhibited EMT by targeting Twist1 in invasive
endometrial cancer cell lines [44]. In line with the role of
miRNAs in regulating Twist, our study demonstrated that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miR-106a inhibited cell invasion through down-regulation
of Twist1 in HCC GR cells. We further validated Twist1 as
a downstream target of miR-106a. Since down-regulation
of Twist1 reversed EMT to MET in GR cells, miR-106a
suppressed EMT partly due to targeting Twist1.
Emerging evidence has indicated that PDGF-D
plays a pivotal role in drug resistance. Moreover,
knockdown of Twist inhibited EMT and led to a reversal
of the chemoresistance in tongue squamous cell carcinoma
[42]. Multiple studies have implicated that miRNAs have
a key role in drug resistance [45]. For example, miR-17-5p
was reported to promote chemotherapeutic drug resistance
through repressing PTEN expression in colorectal cancer
[46]. Zhang et al. found that miR-205 could be a tumor
radiosensitizer via targeting ZEB1 and Ubc13 [47].
Similarly, miR-143 was found to enhance temozolomideinduced apoptosis through targeting N-RAS in glioma
[48]. Additionally, one study showed that methylation of
miR-129-5p CpG island governed multi-drug resistance by
targeting ABC transporters in gastric cancer [49]. Recently,
miR-106a has been considered as key factors to modulate
chemoresistance. For example, upregulation of miR106a was associated with paclitaxel resistance in ovarian
cancer cells [19]. Moreover, miR-106a modulates cisplatin
sensitivity through regulation of PDCD4 (programmed
cell death 4) in ovarian cancer cells [50]. Furthermore,
miR-106a confers cisplatin resistance through targeting
ABCA1 (adenosine triphosphatase-binding cassette A1) in
NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) cells [51]. Similarly,
miR-106a promoted chemoresistance of gastric cancer
cells and suppressed drug-induced apoptosis through

targeting RUNX3 (runt related transcription factor 3)
[52]. Importantly, miRNAs were found to modulate
chemoresistance via targeting Twist. One study showed
that miR-33a promoted osteosarcoma cell resistance to
cisplatin via down-regulation of Twist [53]. Another study
suggested that miR-181a reversed chemoresistance due
to down-regulation of Twist1 in tongue squamous cell
carcinoma [42]. Our current study demonstrated that miR106a regulated Twist1 and reversed EMT, which could
modulate chemoresistance in HCC GR cells. Altogether,
miR-106a could be a common miRNA for drug resistanceassociated EMT in human cancers.
To this end, we found for the first time that PDGF-D
markedly inhibited miR-106a expression. Moreover,
we observed that miR-106a targeted Twist expression.
Furthermore, we observed that miR-106a inhibited EMT
in HCC GR cells. More importantly, PDGF-D expression
was associated with miR-106a and Twist in HCC patients.
However, further in-depth investigation is required to fully
elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PDGF-D-mediated
EMT in HCC GR cells. In summary, our results provide
a possible molecular mechanism for the deregulation of
Twist1 in HCC. Therefore, inactivation of PDGF-D/Twist
and activation of miR-106a could be a novel strategy for
treatment of HCC.

generated in the surface of the plates with a 20 μl pipette
tip. The scratch area was photographed by a microscope
at 0 hour and 20 hours.

Cell attachment and detachment assay
Cell attachment and detachment assays were
performed as described previously [54]. Briefly, for
attachment assay, 5 X 104 cells per well were seeded in
24-well plates. After 1 h, unattached cells were removed.
The attached cells were counted after trypsinization. The
data were presented as a percentage of the attached cells
compared to total cells. For cell detachment assay, the cells
were incubated with 0.05% trypsin for 3 minutes to detach
the cells after 24 hours incubation. Then, the detached cells
were collected. The remaining cells were counted after
detached with 0.25% trypsin. The data were presented as a
percentage of the detached cells to total cells.

Transwell invasion assays
The invasive capacity of cells was performed using
Transwell inserts with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The
cells were seeded in a Matrigel-coated chamber. The upper
chamber has serum-free media, whereas bottom chamber
has complete growth media. After 16 hours of incubation,
the upper surfaces of the Transwell chambers were scraped
with cotton swabs, and the invaded cells were fixed and
stained with Giemsa solution. The stained cells were
photographed under a light microscope.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, reagents and antibodies
HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were cultured at 37°C in
5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. To establish GR cell lines, cells
were continuously exposed to increased concentration of
gemcitabine for more than 6 months until cells displayed
resistance to gemcitabine. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethythiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] was purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo). The secondary antibodies and
primary antibodies against Snail, Slug, and GAPDH were
bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
Anti-PDGF-D, anti-Twist1, anti-Vimentin, anti-E-cadherin
antibodies were obtained from Abcam.

Reverse transcription-PCR analysis for gene
expression
The total RNA from cells was isolated with
Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified with RNeasy Mini Kit
and RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. The expression of GAPDH
was used as internal control. The primers used in the PCR
reactions and RT-PCR amplifications were performed as
described before [10].

Protein extraction and western blotting
Cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer
(1 × PBS, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail). The protein
concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein
assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA). Immunoblotting
was conducted with standard protocols as described
previously [55].

Cell growth study by MTT assay
The cells (5 × 103) were seeded at equal densities
into a 96-well culture plate for overnight incubation.
Then, the cells were treated with different concentrations
of gemcitabine for 72 hours. MTT assay was performed as
described previously [10].

The wild-type and mutant Twist 3’-UTR were
amplified by PCR and cloned in pMIR-REPORT
(Ambion) with firefly luciferase. A total of 5 × 104 cells
treated with control, miR-106a mimics, or miR-106a
inhibitors were transfected with wild-type or mutants of
Twist 3’ UTR luciferase reporters together with Renilla
plasmid. After 48 hours of transfection, the firefly and
Renilla luciferase were measured according to the
manufacturer’s protocols (Promega). The firefly luciferase
activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities.
