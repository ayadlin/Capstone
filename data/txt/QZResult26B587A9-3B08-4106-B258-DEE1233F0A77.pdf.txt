Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DCLK1 and Lgr5 have recently been identified as markers of quiescent and cycling stem cells in
the small intestinal crypts, respectively. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key
development program that is often activated during cancer invasion and metastasis, and also
imparts a self-renewal capability to disseminating cancer cells. Utilizing the Citrobacter
rodentium (CR)-induced transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH) model, we observed a
relative decrease in DCLK1 expression in the colonic crypts, with significant shift towards stromal
staining at peak (12 days post infection) hyperplasia, whereas staining for Lgr5 and Msi-1
increased several fold. When hyperplasia was regressing (days 20–34), an expansion of DCLK1
+ve cells in the CR-infected crypts compared with that seen in uninfected control was recorded.
Purified colonic crypt cells exhibiting epigenetic modulation of the transforming growth factor-β
(TGFβ), Wnt and Notch pathways on 12 or 34 days post infection formed monolayers in vitro, and
underwent trans-differentiation into fibroblast-like cells that stained positive for vimentin,
fibronectin and DCLK1. These cells when trypsinized and regrown in soft agar, formed
colonospheres/organoids that developed into crypt-like structures (colonoids) in Matrigel and
stained positive for DCLK1. Mice exhibiting 12 or 34 days of TMCH were given azoxymethane
once for 8 h (Gp1) or weekly for 3 weeks (Gp2), and subjected to crypt isolation. Crypt cells from
Gp1 animals formed monolayers as well as colonospheres in soft agar and nodules/tumors in nude

mice. Crypt cells isolated from Gp2 animals failed to form the monolayers, but developed into
colonospheres in soft agar and nodules/tumors in nude mice. Thus, both hyperplasia and increased
presence of DCLK1 +ve cells promote cellular transformation in response to a second hit. The
TMCH model, therefore, provides an excellent template to study how alterations in intestinal stem
cells promote trans-differentiation, crypt regeneration or colon carcinogenesis following bacterial
infection.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The epithelial cells of the mammalian colon are arranged in millions of crypts, whereas the
stem cells, located at the base of the crypt, are responsible for epithelial tissue renewal.1,2
We have recently identified DCLK1 and Lgr5 as markers of quiescent and cycling stem
cells, respectively.3 Investigations of neoplastic tissues have provided evidence of selfrenewing, stem-like cells within the tumors called cancer stem cells (CSCs) that facilitate de
novo tumor growth.4 Cancer progression is manifested by the presence or absence of tumor
metastasis and dissemination of cancer cells with self-renewal capability.5 As epithelial cells
in general are nonmotile, cancers of the epithelial cells called carcinomas must undergo a
process of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) at the invasive front to produce single
migratory cells that lose E-cadherin expression. This is concomitant with deregulation of the
Wnt pathway and a selective loss of the basement membrane.6 More recently, normal
mammary epithelial cells are shown to adopt the CD44high/CD24lowexpression profile when
exposed to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1) or when EMT-inducing transcription
factors Snail or Twist are conditionally overexpressed.7 Together, these studies suggest that
it is not unprecedented for EMT to generate mesenchymal cells with characteristics of stemlike cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

During EMT, the epithelial cells lose their differentiated characteristics, including apical–
basal polarity, and acquire mesenchymal features instead, including motility and
invasiveness.8 The mesenchymal state is associated with the capacity of cells to migrate to
distant organs and maintain stemness, allowing their subsequent differentiation into multiple
cell types either during development or during initiation of metastasis.9 Similarly, the
reverse process, called mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), is not only essential for
normal tissue and organ development but also involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, and it
seems to have an important role in colonic crypt regeneration.10,11
Multiple signaling pathways including TGFβ, Wnt, Notch and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappalight-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) in tandem with transcriptional factors such as
Slug, Snail, Twist, Zeb1 and 2 suppress the expression of E-cadherin and induce EMT,
resulting in loss of cell–cell adhesion and increased tumor progression and migration.12–16
Recently, histone modification and chromatin remodeling are shown as the key regulators of
eukaryotic transcription, and therefore are excellent targets for pathogenic infection.17

Similarly, hypoxia, which is a frequent feature of the microenvironment of infected
tissues,18,19 induces hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-mediated activation of histone deacetylase
(HDAC)3, and is recently shown to be essential for EMT and metastasis.20 These alterations
in signaling pathways during an enteric infection can cause tissue/organ damage and can
also promote the acquisition of malignant phenotype.21–23 In the intestine, for example, a
recent study demonstrated expression of EMT markers during the pathogenesis of fistulae in
Crohn’s disease.24 Similarly, lipopolysaccharide, the main component of the Gram-negative
bacterial cell wall, induces EMT of intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells.25 However, a
possible link between enteric infection-induced changes in intracellular signaling and transdifferentiation of hyperproliferating colonic crypt cells to generate stem-like cells has not
been established.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (CR) naturally infects mice using a mechanism
similar to those employed by attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Entero-hemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC).26,27 The genes
regulating the A/E lesion formation in CR are carried on a pathogenicity island termed the
locus of enterocyte effacement that encodes transcriptional regulators and structural
components of a type III secretion system.28 CR is an A/E pathogen that causes increased
proliferation in the distal colon of adult outbred mice, without associated injury or
significant histological inflammation.29 In genetically susceptible strains, clinical signs such
as retarded growth, diarrhea, dehydration, coat ruffling, hunched pasture and high mortality
have been reported.29 Utilizing the CR-induced transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia
(TMCH) model, we have shown previously that hyperplasia of the colonic crypts in the
outbred mice is associated with activation of the Wnt/β-catenin,30–34 Notch35,36 and NFκB37,38 pathways, which are integral to EMT as well. In the inbred mice, a dual phase
following CR infection, wherein crypt hyperplasia due to activation of the MEK/ERK/NFκB pathways, precedes acute/chronic inflammation characterized by expression of distinct
cytokines/chemokines.39 As pathways such as those activated during TMCH, besides TGFβ
superfamily, may trigger the process of EMT, we hypothesized that CR infection-induced
changes in intracellular signalingin vivo,30–39 as well as chromatin remodeling to impose a
specific transcriptional profile, may be sufficient for isolated colonic crypt cells to survive in
culture and undergo EMT or MET-like changes in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. This
hypothesis was tested in the current study.

RESULTS
Effect of CR-induced crypt hyperplasia on colonic stem cells
We have shown previously that a biphasic response of progression (days 6–12) and
regression (days 20–34) of hyperplasia correlates with changes in crypt lengths in
NIH:Swiss outbred mice.30–38 Most crypt cells in the gut mucosa have a residence time of
only 3–5 days in the crypt. We therefore hypothesized that sustained proliferation of the
colonic crypts on day 12 and beyond 30–38 may either be due to overproduction of stem
and/or progenitor cells. We therefore set out to determine the changes in expression of stem
and/or progenitor cell markers during the progression and regression phases of colonic crypt
hyperplasia. When total RNA isolated from the crypts on days 6, 12 and 34 was subjected to

real-time RT–PCR, DCLK1 mRNA expression on day 6, and particularly, on day 12
decreased significantly, compared with uninfected control [Figure 1a(i)]. On day 34,
however, DCLK1 expression was higher in the crypts than that either on day 6 or 12 [Figure
1a(i)]. The changes in DCLK1 mRNA correlated with protein levels and paralleled Klf4
expression, which is predominantly expressed by differentiated epithelial cells
(Supplementary Figure 1A). During immunostaining for DCLK1, both uninfected normal
and day-6 crypts exhibited staining that were similar, whereas on day 12, relative staining
for DCLK1 decreased in the crypt [Figure 1a(ii)]. Intriguingly, there was a significant shift
in DCLK1 staining towards the subepithelial and submucosal regions at this time point
[Figure 1a(ii)]. While the hyperplasia was regressing on days 20–34, DCLK1 +ve cells
expanded in the crypt, with a gradual increase on days 20,27 and 34, compared with that
seen in the uninfected control [Figure 1a(ii)]. Even though these findings are consistent with
DCLK1 being a marker of quiescent stem cells,3 they also suggest that DCLK1 may not be
the reservoir for rapidly proliferating cells at peak hyperplasia. We therefore investigated
whether expression of Lgr5, a marker of rapidly cycling cells, and Msi-1, a marker of
progenitor cells, change, following CR infection. During real-time PCR analysis, Lgr5
expression increased significantly on days 6, 12 and 20 compared with the uninfected
control, followed by a decline on days 27–34 [Figure 1b(i)], and correlated with protein
levels at these time points (Supplementary Figure 1A). Immunostaining for Lgr5 [Figure
1b(ii)] along with Msi-1 (Figure 1c) increased significantly between days 6 and 20
compared to uninfected control, with a gradual decline on days 27–34. These changes were
specific to Citrobacter, as a CR mutant (ΔescV) lacking functional type-three secretion
system that prevents CR from injecting its effector proteins into host cells failed to exhibit
β-catenin, NF-κB-p65 or Notch-dependent increases in crypt hyperplasia (Supplementary
Figures 1B and C). Thus, at least two distinct populations of stem cells following CR
infection may differentially regulate crypt hyperplasia.
Evidence of CR—induced EMT

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Bacterial infections, such as those associated with Helicobacter pylori, increase EMT in the
gastric cancer setting and in a series of human gastric cell lines.23 Whether a non-neoplastic,
hyperproliferating colonic epithelium is also predisposed to similar fate following infection
with an enteric pathogen is not known, and was investigated next. Colonic crypt cells
isolated from uninfected normal mice did not form monolayers in vitro and remained as
single cells in the absence of intestinotrophic factors such as R-spondin or Noggin,
following a 30-day period (Figure 2a). Day-12 and -34 cells, on the other hand, not only
formed monolayers but also exhibited significant trans-differentiation into fibroblast-like
mesenchymal cells within 6–12 days post plating (Figure 2b). These changes were not
driven by contamination from the mesenchymal cells during the isolation process, as the
purified crypts (Supplementary Figures 1D and E) were negative for α-smooth muscle actin
expression either in uninfected or in 6–34-day post-infected crypt cellular extracts
(Supplementary Figure 1F), whereas cells isolated from uninfected mouse distal colon not
only failed to grow beyond 1–2 weeks in culture conditions that included D-valine40 or
citrulline,41 but never changed their phenotype (data not shown). When the cells in
monolayers were stained for markers of EMT, they stained positive for vimentin but
negative for E-cadherin, suggesting an EMT-like process in vitro (Figure 2d). These changes

were also confirmed via western blotting (Supplementary Figure 1G). Interestingly, as
depicted in Figure 2d, the cells also stained positive for both DCLK1 and fibronectin, further
suggesting a stem cell-driven EMT-like phenomenon. The phenotypic changes in day-12
crypts were apparently driven by CR-induced increases in: (i) β-catenin and its downstream
targets Jagged-1 and cyclinD1, with a concomitant decrease in E-cadherin [Figure 2e(i),
e(ii)]; (ii) Notch intracellular domain and Hes-1, with concomitant decrease in Atoh-1
[Figure 2f(i), f(ii)] and (iii) TGFβ along with increases in Slug and Snail, the repressors of
E-cadherin [Figure 2g(i), g(ii)]. To validate CR’s role in promoting EMT-like processes in
vitro, we utilized Young Adult Mouse Colon (YAMC) cells that are immortalized, but
remain non-clonogenic in soft agar and nontumorigenic in nude mice.42 YAMC cells in
control medium displayed cuboidal morphology and had robust E-cadherin expression by
both immunofluorescent labeling and western blot [Figure 3a(i), a(ii)]. In contrast, the same
cells became spindle shaped, lost E-cadherin expression and exhibited increased vimentin
expression following CR infection [Figure 3a(i), a(ii)]. Interestingly, CR-infected cells also
stained positive for DCLK1 that colocalized with vimentin, whereas uninfected cells were
negative for either of these proteins (Figure 3b). As vimentin is a target of β-catenin/Tcf4
signaling,43 cells treated with β-catenin small interfering RNA failed to exhibit vimentin
staining in response to CR infection, which paralleled the lack of vimentin staining in cells
treated with Notch blocker dibenzazepine (DBZ),35 whereas E-cadherin staining was not
detected under either condition (Figure 3c). During would-healing assay, CR infection
compared with uninfected control increased the cellular migration, whereas β-catenin small
interfering RNA almost completely, and ΔescV and DBZ partially, inhibited cell migration
[Figure 3d(i), d(ii)]. Consistent with hypoxia being a frequent feature of the
microenvironment of infected tissues due to activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor and
NF-κB pathways,18,19 CR-infection-induced Hif-1α expression that coincided with relative
increases in Hif-1α levels during hypoxia, in addition to induction of HDAC3, β-catenin,
Slug and Snail (Supplementary Figure 2A). During wound-healing assay, N-acetylcysteine,
an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species activity that is elevated during hypoxia,44 inhibited
CR-induced cell migration under normoxic conditions [Figure 3e(i), e(ii)]. During hypoxia,
although CR-induced cell migration was recorded within 6 h, CR only partially rescued Nacetylcysteine-induced inhibition of cell migration [Figure 3f(i), f(ii)] due in part to
decreases in β-catenin, Slug and Snail (Supplementary Figure 2A). The spindle-shaped
morphology recorded during normoxia and, more so, during hypoxia (Supplementary Figure
2B) was specific to CR infection, as noninfected cells remained mostly cuboidal even under
hypoxic conditions despite loss of E-cadherin, whereas vimentin staining in CR-infected
cells was similar under both conditions (Supplementary Figure 2C). Thus, CR infection
seems to facilitate phenotypic change that promotes cellular migration.
Epigenetics and EMT
Epigenetic mechanisms have recently been implicated in driving the process of EMT.20 We
investigated whether epigenetic modulation of β-catenin, E-cadherin or its repressor Snail
may be contributing towards trans-differentiation of isolated crypt cells in culture. Analysis
of HDAC profile in the crypts revealed significant increases in both HDAC3 on days 6 and
12, and HDAC4 on days 12 and 34 compared with the uninfected control [Figure 4a(i)]. In
the crypt-denuded lamina propria representing the mesenchyme,39 HDAC3 levels remained

elevated on days 6–34, whereas HDAC4 levels were higher on days 6–12 before declining
on day 34 [Figure 4a(ii)]. Increases in HDAC3 on days 6 and 12 were associated with robust
expression of H3K4me3, and its methylase SMYD3 in the crypt. In the crypt-denuded
lamina propria, although changes in H3K4me3 were subtle, SMYD3 increased significantly
on day 12, followed by a decline on day 34 [Figure 4a(i),a(ii)]. Polycomb repressive
complex protein Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) increased significantly in the crypt
on day 6 post infection, followed by a declining trend on days 12 and 34, and coincided with
expression of EZH2 target protein H3K27me3 (Figure 4b) that marks the repressive
chromatin signature. Indeed, expression of Wnt antagonist Dickkopf (Dkk)-2 decreased
significantly on days 6 and 12 (Figure 4c), whereas downregulation of H3K27me3 on day
12 in the crypt coincided with upregulation of β-catenin, cyclinD1, Slug and Snail (see
Figures 2e–g). Interestingly, an almost-complete loss of H3K27me3 expression was
observed in the crypt-denuded lamina propria on days 6 and 12 compared with the
uninfected control (Figure 4d), which coincided with trans-differentiation of cultured crypt
epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells (see Figure 2). As proof-of-principle, knockdown of
EZH2 significantly inhibited Topflash reporter activity but not NF-κB signaling due to
downregulation of β-catenin [Figure 4e(i), e(ii)], suggesting EZH2-induced derepression of
Wnt antagonists (for example, Dkk-2, Wif-1 and so on, not shown) in the process. During
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in the crypt on day 6, EZH2’s accumulation around βcatenin, Jagged-1, H3K4m3-methyltransferase SMYD3 and Snail promoters resulted in
decreased levels, whereas E-cadherin levels slightly increased (Figure 4f). Similar chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay in the crypt on day 12 revealed H3K4me3’s accumulation
around β-catenin, Jagged-1, SMYD3 and Snail promoters, resulting in upregulation,
whereas E-cadherin levels slightly decreased (Figure 4g), further supporting EMT-like
phenomenon.
Isolated crypt cells with the ability to form spheroids and/or organoids in vitro

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As the ability to self-renew is a hallmark of stem cells and the formation of epithelial-like
colonies (spheroids) is an index of self-renewal, we next explored the possibility that CRinfected colonic crypt cells will be better suited to form spheroids (called ‘colonospheres’
from now onwards) in vitro compared with their uninfected counterparts. As depicted in
Figure 5a(i), freshly isolated crypt cells from uninfected normal distal colon failed to form
colonospheres, which is consistent with the inability to form monolayers in the absence of
intestinotrophic factors. Crypt cells from days 12 to 34, on the other hand, formed welldeveloped colonospheres both at 5 and 8 weeks post plating, whereas day-6 crypt cells only
developed colonospheres at 8 weeks [Figure 5a(i)]. Figure 5a(ii) is a representative bar
graph showing average number of colonospheres formed/well at indicated times compared
with the uninfected controls. Next, we delineated the possibility of cells growing in
monolayers to form organoids in vitro. As depicted in Figure 5b(i), cells from days 12 to 34,
when trypsinized and regrown in soft agar, transitioned into well-developed organoids at 5
weeks and more so at 8 weeks, whereas day-6 cells developed smaller organoids. Figure
5b(ii) is a representative bar graph showing average number of organoids formed/well at
indicated times compared with uninfected controls. Interestingly, within 3 weeks, the same
cells from days 12 or 34 when trypsinized and embedded in Matrigel developed into
colonoids[Figure 5c(i)]. Figure 5Cii is a representative immunohistochemistry of day-12

colonoid showing H&E, PAS, Ki-67 and DCLK1 staining, whereas 5D is a representative
western blot, showing relative levels of DCLK1 and Lgr5 in the colonoids. Thus, CRinfected colonic crypt cells not only undergo trans-differentiation into EMT-like cells but
also retain the ability to form organoids/colonoids in vitro in the absence of known epithelial
mitogens.
Signaling via the Wnt and Notch pathways regulates EMT

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We have shown previously that CR-induced colonic crypt hyperplasia is associated with
robust activation of the Wnt/β-catenin30–35 and Notch35,36 pathways, and interference with
the Wnt/Notch crosstalk abrogates hyperplasia.35 We therefore hypothesized that blocking
these pathways in vivo will significantly reduce the ability of the isolated crypt cells to either
undergo EMT or form colonospheres and/or organoids in vitro. We utilized nanoparticleencapsulated small interfering RNA approach to target β-catenin (si-β-Cat-NP) while Notch
signaling was targeted in vivo by γ-secretase inhibitor, DBZ as described.35 As depicted in
Figure 6a, uninfected colonic crypt cells failed to form the monolayers, whereas day-12
crypt cells exhibited monolayer formation as described elsewhere. In response to either with
si-β-Cat-NP or DBZ for 10 days, we did not observe monolayer formation in either case
[Figure 6a(i)], whereas a combination approach to include both inhibitors did not necessarily
yield a synergistic response [Figure 6a(i)]. Western blotting revealed significant
downregulation of both active and total β-catenin along with decreases in downstream
targets Jagged-1, Slug and Snail with si-β-Cat-NP, whereas only Snail was downregulated
with DBZ compared with CR + vehicle-treated samples [Figure 6a(ii), a(iii)]. During the
colonosphere formation assay, day-12 cells formed well-developed colonospheres compared
with the uninfected control [Figure 6b(i)]. si-β-Cat-NP completely blocked colonosphere
formation, whereas DBZ treatment led to significant reduction in both number and size of
colonospheres formed in vitro [Figure 6b(i)]. Interestingly, the combination approach was
much more effective in blocking colonospheres formation [Figure 6b(i)]. Figure 6b(ii) is a
representative bar graph showing average number of colonospheres formed/well in various
treatment groups. Thus, CR-induced activation of both the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch
pathways in vivo is apparently sufficient to provide the necessary ingredients needed for the
process of trans-differentiation to begin in vitro, and that the interplay between the two
pathways provides an interesting target to block EMT in vivo.

Effect of cellular transformation on EMT and/or colonospheres/organoid formation in vitro
In the TMCH model, CR-induced hyperplastic state increases the susceptibility to the
mutagenic effect of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine.45 We therefore hypothesized that both the
hyperplasia on days 6 and 12 as well as increased presence of DCLK1 + ve cells on day 34
will facilitate cellular transformation following a second hit. NIH:Swiss mice either
uninfected or exhibiting 6, 12 or 34 days of TMCH were given azoxymethane (AOM) once
for 8 h (Gp1) or weekly for 3 weeks (Gp2), followed by crypt isolation a week later. As
depicted in Figure 7ai, crypt cells from uninfected mice receiving AOM acquired the ability
to form monolayers in vitro compared with untreated controls. However, they failed to
exhibit a continuous growth pattern that stalled completely within few days after plating. In
contrast, both day-12 and -34 cells from Gp1 animals exhibited significant growth in culture
compared with cells from the same time point without AOM [Figure 7a(i)], and retained the

ability to form colonospheres/organoids [Figure 7a(ii)]. Figure 7a(iii) is a representative bar
graph showing average number of colonospheres formed/well in various treatment groups.
In Gp2 animals, we recorded some fascinating observations: neither uninfected normal nor
day-12 or -34 cells exhibited any monolayer formation compared with cells without AOM
[Figure 7b(i)], but exhibited significant growth as colonospheres when directly embedded in
soft agar [Figure 7b(ii)]. Figure 7b(iii) is a representative bar graph showing average number
of colonospheres formed/well in various treatment groups. During immunostaining of cells
in monolayers from Gp1 animals, day-12 and -34 cells compared with either day-6 or
uninfected cells exhibited significant co-staining for both DCLK1 and fibronectin [Figure
8a, b(ii)–b(iii)], whereas CD133, a CSC marker, also exhibited increased staining in
response to AOM but failed to colocalize with an epithelial marker laminin (Supplementary
Figure 3). Thus, AOM-induced complete cellular transformation may be inhibitory for
monolayer formation in vitro, and that the EMT–MET, which we recorded on day-12 or 34
cells without AOM (see Figures 5b–d), may be more relevant in the regulation of
hyperplasia than tumorigenesis.
CR/AOM treatment promotes nodular and/or tumorigenic growth in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next in a xenograft study, we examined the nodular or tumorigenic growth potential of
colonospheres generated from the two groups of animals. When injected subcutaneously,
colonospheres from both Gp1 and Gp2 mice developed nodular/tumorigenic growth in
athymic/nude mice. Specifically, the colonospheres collected from day-12 or -34 cells
without AOM developed nodular growth, but the growth tapered off within 6 weeks (Figure
9a). Both colonospheres from Gp1 and particularly from Gp2 mice exhibited significant
nodular and/or tumorigenic growth, which was sustained for at least 12 weeks (Figure 9a).
Interestingly, colonospheres from Gp2 mice developed nodules/tumors quickly within 45
days post injection compared with 75 days for Gp1 mice, and the sizes of these nodules/
tumors were also significantly different (Figure 9a). Figure 9b is a tumor-growth curve
showing percent growth of the xenograft in the two groups versus control. When these
nodules/tumors were fixed, and sectioned and stained for markers of epithelial/mesenchymal
lineages along with a stem cell marker, we observed significant heterogeneity in cell types,
as nodules/tumors were positive for both vimentin and cytokeratin along with DCLK1
(Figure 9c). Thus, both hyperplasia (on day 12 of TMCH) and increased expression of
DCLK1 (on day 34 of TMCH) may be associated with cellular transformation and
tumorigenic growth.

DISCUSSION
The EMT–MET processes have central roles in embryonic development, fibrogenesis and
tumor progression.8 Many stimuli, signal transduction pathways, such as Wnt46–49 and
Notch,50–53 and transcription factors, such as Slug and Snail, govern the acquisition of
EMT. As many of these EMT-signaling pathways are also upregulated by microbial
pathogens, these studies suggest that pathogens should be considered as potential EMT
inducers. Indeed, modulation of TGFβ following microbial invasion of cultured cells is
implicated in the EMT process.52,54 However, little is known regarding our understanding of
how these pathways coordinately suppress the epithelial phenotype and induce a

mesenchymal program that generates cells with properties of stem cells, and whether the
acquisition of EMT phenotype could be an early event triggered by enteric pathogens. In the
current study, we demonstrate that CR infection-induced activation of the Wnt/β–catenin,
Notch and TGFβ pathways in vivo promotes trans-differentiation of cultured crypt cells into
fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells, and that these EMT-like events are likely sustained by
transient epigenetic changes including histone modification and chromatin remodeling. The
fact that blocking both of the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch pathways either separately or
together blocked the monolayer-forming ability of these cultured cells rules out the
possibility that the isolated cells may have been either fibroblasts or other mesenchymal
cells that will simply outgrow the epithelial cells in culture. A corroborating study in vitro
has shown that lipopolysaccharide induces EMT of intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells.25
Moreover, pathogenic H. pylori strain 60190 is shown to induce EMT markers Slug and
Snail,23 whereas diffusely adherent E. coli also promotes an EMT-like behavior in
vitro.55–57 We now provide evidence of CR-induced EMT of immortalized, but primary,
epithelial cells that promotes cell migration and intriguingly exhibits responses that mimic
changes recorded during hypoxia. Given that hypoxia/Hif-1α regulates metastatic processes,
especially EMT by directly interacting with β-catenin44,58 or Notch intracellular domain,59
it is not surprising that CR infection that mimics hypoxia and is associated with activation of
the Wnt/β-catenin30,34 and Notch35,36 pathways, promotes neoplasia in response to a second
hit.36,45 Finally, several recent studies have shown that it is not unprecedented for EMT to
generate cells with many of the properties of self-renewing stem cells (7–9). Most of these
studies, however, rely on ectopic expression of either the Twist or Snail transcription
factors, both of which are capable of inducing EMTs in epithelial cells.60–62 We provide
data that suggest that both HDAC3 and HDAC4 via differential expression of H3K4me3 and
H3K27me3 may lie at the center of chromatin alterations in one case to repress Wnt
antagonists, and in the other to activate genes that promote EMT (see Figure 4). This notion
is supported by a recent finding by Wu et al.20 who showed an essential role for HDAC3 in
hypoxia-induced EMT. At the clinical level, our findings corroborate with studies both in
patients with Crohn’s disease24 and in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced
model of Crohn’s colitis63 that exhibits EMT. As the process of EMT is usually associated
with metastasis and frank malignancy, our findings suggest that this process may be an early
event which, despite defying the conventional wisdom, could still be facilitated by a
pathogenic insult. Thus, although TMCH is a self-limiting disease, the observed changes
recapitulate series of events that precede cancer cell metastasis and tumor spread. We
believe, however, that this epigenetically regulated EMT process may not reflect a classic
EMT, but could be related to the stromal–epithelial crosstalk that is required to maintain
crypt homeostasis in response to CR infection. Whether stromal presence of DCLK1 is the
driving force behind this crosstalk is currently being investigated.
Stem-like cells in the primary epithelial tumor may undergo EMT to give rise to migrating
CSCs, which may revert to stationary epithelial-like CSCs after a MET at the site of
metastasis.64 However, how MET is regulated in vivo is not known. On the basis of findings
in colorectal cancer metastases, a transient EMT–MET process characterized by phenotypic
plasticity could be triggered by environmental agents and may involve reversible epigenetic
modifications in relevant genes.64 In the current study, we have discovered significant

colonosphere-forming ability of the freshly isolated, as well as trypsinized, cells in culture
from infected mice, and blocking the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch pathways either separately or
together completely abolishes colonosphere-forming ability. Intriguingly, the same cells
when grown in Matrigel developed into colonoids, suggesting a role for microenvironment
such as extracellular matrix, in the process. The fact that these colonoids exhibited positive
staining for DCLK1 suggests an inherent ability of the DCLK1 + ve cells to promote the
transient EMT–MET process in vitro. At the same time however, it is also conceivable that
the non-stem cells in this population may spontaneously convert to a stem-like state, as is
shown recently,65 thereby promoting the EMT–MET process in vitro. Nevertheless, as no
definitive proof exists for a transient EMT–MET, our studies, which despite not being a true
reflection of macrometases, still represent the only evidence for such a process in a
nonmalignant setting, and suggests that the stem cell plasticity observed during the EMT–
MET process can be applied as a tool to study crypt regeneration following a pathogenic
insult.

The CR-induced hyperplastic state increases the susceptibility to either mutagenic insult45 or
in mice heterozygous for Apc gene.36,66 In the current study, we observed either monolayer
and colonosphere formation during acute AOM injection or simply colonosphere formation
in two-dimensional culture following chronic AOM treatment. Interestingly, colonospheres
from day-12 and -34 cells when injected subcutaneously into athymic/nude mice developed
nodules/tumors of comparable sizes, thereby confirming our earlier hypothesis. Whether the
monolayer or nodule/tumor formation was a characteristic of stem cells was confirmed by
staining for both DCLK1 and CD133. We have shown recently that DCLK1 regulates EMT
of human pancreatic cells through a miR-200a-dependent mechanism, and that nanoparticlebased delivery of si-DCLK1 inhibits colorectal cancer tumor growth via a Notch-1dependent mechanism.67,68 Moreover, a link between EMT and stem cells is recently
established.7 As stem cell state correlates with bivalent activating/repressing histone
modification of H3K4me/H3K27me,69 it is tempting to speculate that CR-induced
epigenetic changes in either HDAC3/4 or EZH2 may be critical in regulating the epithelial–
mesenchymal balance. Efforts are therefore underway to block HDAC3/4 or EZH2 or
knockdown DCLK1, either in vivo or in vitro to see if either EMT or nodules/tumor
formation could be interfered with.

In conclusion, deregulation of tumor-suppressor and/or stem cell-associated pathways (for
example, Wnt, JAK-STAT, JNK, Notch and so on), as well as epigenetic reprogramming
induced by bacteria, are possible causes of cancer development in epithelial niches.54
We 30–39 and others70 have extensively shown that enteric pathogens such as CR can
activate signaling pathways that are directly relevant in the early-onset EMT. In addition, the
EMT–MET process can be used as a tool to study regenerative medicine for various
debilitating diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, our studies may also help
us understand the molecular basis of microbial pathogenesis and in defining future
therapeutic strategy in treating diseases with infectious etiology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia
TMCH was induced in 5–6 week-old Helicobacter-free NIH:Swiss mice (Harlan, IN, USA)
by oral inoculation with a 16-h culture of either wild-type CR or type-three secretion
system- mutant ΔescV, as previously described.30–39 Age- and sex-matched control mice
received sterile culture medium only. Animals were euthanized on 6, 12, 20, 27 and 34 days
post infection, and distal colons removed and portions of the colon were fixed for
immunohistochemistry. Distal colonic crypts or crypt-denuded lamina propria were isolated
as described.30–39,71,72
AOM injection to induce cellular transformation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the first strategy (group 1), uninfected normal (N) or CR-infected NIH:Swiss mice on 12
or 34 days post infection received either a single intraperitoneal injection of AOM in saline
at 10 mg/kg body weight or saline alone as controls, and the animals were euthanized after 8
h. In the second strategy (group 2), N or CR-infected mice on 12 or 34 days post infection
received three injections of AOM or saline (at 10 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally at
weekly intervals, followed by euthanasia 1 week later. Crypts were isolated from these
colons as described30–39,71,72 and used for either monolayer formation or for spheroid assay.
Monolayer formation of crypt cells, hypoxia and wound-healing assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Isolated crypts were centrifuged at 1000 r.p.m. for 5 min. The pellets were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in RPMI glutamax medium/0.5 U/ml dispase at 37
°C and shaken gently for 5 min. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in RPMI glutamax
medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum plus penicillin and streptomycin, and
incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Monolayer formation was followed for 0–30 days by
replacing the medium at 48 h. For hypoxia (1.0% O2) experiments, YAMC cells were
seeded in normoxia and grown to subconfluence of ~60–70%, or as specifically needed.
After 2 h of serum-free culture, cells were exposed to hypoxia in a hypoxic chamber
(Thermal Tech, Orlando, FL, USA) for indicated duration. Cells were infected with CR
(multiplicity of infection 1:30) for 3 h, washed and treated with reactive oxygen species
inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (100 μmol/l). For wound-healing assay, YAMC cells (1 × 106)
seeded onto 12-well plates were scratched using a sterile pipette tip 3–6 h post seeding, and
the same spots were photographed under phase contrast microscopy at 6–12 h post
‘wounding’.
Clonogenic assay
Freshly isolated crypt cells or cells growing as monolayers were trypsinized and pelleted at
1000 r.p.m. for 5 min at 4 °C before being suspended at an approximate density of 5000
cells/200 μl/well (48-well plate) in 2 × RPMI medium containing 0.3% soft agar with 5%
fetal calf serum, without intestinotrophic mitogens such as R-spondin or Noggin. The cell
suspensions were plated in 48-well plate above a layer of solidified 1% soft agar in plain 2 ×
RPMI medium. The plates were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and the cells were
followed for spheroid formation in RPMI glutamax medium plus 1% fetal calf serum at

weekly intervals for 5–8 weeks. For colonosphere assay in Matrigel, same number of cells
were resuspended in 100 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel in a 48-well plate, and
colonosphere formation was followed as described.73–75
Knockdown of Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling in vivo
For blocking β-catenin in vivo, we injected intraperitoneally β-catenin small interfering
RNA incorporated into poly (lactide-co-glycolide) acid nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) (at 4
μM/kg body weight) every alternate day for 10 days, followed by euthanasia at 12 days post
infection. These PLGA-NPs were synthesized using a double emulsion solvent evaporation
technique as described.76 To block Notch signaling in vivo, we used a cell-permeable
inhibitor of γ-secretase, DBZ (EMD Chemicals, Inc, Gibbstown, NJ, USA) as described.35
Distal colonic crypts were isolated on 12 days post infection as described,30–39,71,72 and
used for both monolayer formation and spheroid assays.
Xenograft study

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For xenograft study, spheroids formed in soft agar were counted and resuspended in
phosphate-buffered saline, and ~1000 spheroids were injected subcutaneously into the left
flanks of athymic nude mice (BALB/cnu/nu; Harlan). Engrafted mice were inspected
biweekly for nodule/tumor appearance by visual observation and palpation. Mice were
euthanized when the tumor size reached a diameter of 0.5–1 cm or on 2 months post
transplantation, and the tumors were analyzed as described.67,68,73,74,77
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and western blotting
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed in the isolated crypts, utilizing the
commercially available CHIP 1-day kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Cellular or nuclear extracts prepared from the isolated crypts
(30–50 μg protein/lane) were subjected to SDS–PAGE and western blotting with appropriate
primary and secondary antibodies, respectively, as described.30–39,71,72
Immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fluorescent microscopy on confluent cells or immunohistochemistry on 4-μm-thick paraffinembedded sections prepared either from distal colon or organoids/colonoids were performed
as described.30–39,71,72

Signaling via the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch pathways are critical for EMT and for
colonosphere formation. (ai) CR-infected mice received intraperitoneal injections of either
nanoparticle-encapsulated β-catenin siRNA (si-β-Cat) or γ-secretase inhibitor DBZ for 10
days, followed by crypt isolation and plating for monolayer formation. Please note the
almost-complete lack of monolayer formation when cells were isolated from animals treated
with either si-β-Cat or DBZ separately or in combination. (aii,aiii) Western blots for
indicated proteins in the colonic crypt cellular extracts prepared from uninfected normal (N),
CR-infected (CR), CR-infected + vehicle-treated (CR + V), CR-infected and either si-β-Cat
(CR + si) or DBZ-treated (CR + DBZ) mice (n = 3 independent experiments). (bi) Colonic
crypt cells isolated from above group of animals were tested for their ability to form
colonospheres in vitro. Although day 12 cells formed colonospheres as expected, si-β-Cattreated cells failed to form any colonosphere. DBZ alone also inhibited colonosphere
formation, but the inhibition was more efficient when the two inhibitors were given in
combination. (bii) A representative bar graph showing average number of colonosphere
formed/well at indicated time points compared with uninfected controls. *P<0.05 versus
