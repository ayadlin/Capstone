Overcoming treatment resistance in acute promyelocytic
leukemia and beyond

domains have been revealed as potential therapeutic targets
in various cancers. To search for critical factors involved in
ATRA response, our lab has discovered histone demethylase
PHF8 as a key mediator that governs the ATRA sensitivity in
APL cells, and assigns a new function of this class of epigenetic
modifying enzymes in mediating treatment response/resistance
(Arteaga et al., Cancer Cell, 2013, 23: 376-89). PHF8 is
recruited to PML-RARA upon ATRA treatment to remove the
repressive transcriptional mark but enhances activation mark
of PML-RARA downstream target genes. Over-expression
or enhanced phosphorylation of PHF8 induces epigenetic
reprogramming that resurrects both in vitro and in vivo ATRAsensitivity to resistant APL cells carrying the LBD mutant of
PML-RARA or forming aberrant transcriptional repressor
complexes associated with the fusion (Figure 1e). In addition,
PHF8 can also overcome ATRA-resistant associated with the
variant APL fusion, PLZF-RARA that cannot be targeted by
ATO. As a proof of principle, pharmacological inhibition of
PHF8 dephosphorylation by okadaic acid (OA) re-sensitizes
ATRA-resistant APL cells to the treatment and significantly
extends the disease latency in animal models, suggesting PHF8
activator may help to overcome ATRA-resistance. Interestingly,
since PHF8 specially binds to region C of the RARA moiety to
mediate transcriptional activation and subsequent degradation of
the fusion, it is tempting to speculate that PHF8 may be useful
in tackling ATO-resistant APL cells carrying mutations on the
PML moiety (Figure 1f). On other other hand, identification
of PHF8 as a major mediator for ATRA response can also have
important implications to the potential application of ATRA to
other cancers. While the RARA fusion is the major target of
PHF8-mediated ATRA response in APL cells, wild type RARA
may also interact with PHF8 to mediate ATRA response in
other cell types. It is evidenced that over-expression of PHF8
can facilitate neuronal differentiation of embryonic carcinoma
cells. It will be of interest to assess if PHF8 may also act as a
positive retinoic acid modulator (RAM) and manipulation of its
activity can confer ATRA sensitivity to other cancer subtypes,
in particular neuroblastoma where retinoic acid signaling has
already been implicated.
With the improved understanding of the molecular
basis of cancer, an increasing number of target therapies have
been developed and some already show promises in early
phases of various clinical trials. While these therapies will
very likely improve the complete remission rate for certain
cancers and minimizes the highly toxic side effects associated
with chemotherapy, it is foreseeable that drug resistance will
be observed in a significant number of patients undergoing
these highly specific treatments. Tackling treatment resistance
will likely be a major challenge of any future targeted therapy.
Having better understanding the mechanisms underlying the
treatment response will provide unprecedented opportunities
to predict and overcome treatment resistance in the refractory
subset of patients. APL can be not only an inspiring story in

From the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
to the recent development of arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment,
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) characterized by the
presence of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) fusion has
been transformed from a highly fatal cancer to a highly curable
disease. In spite of this unprecedented success, there are still a
significant number of high-risk patients who fail to achieve a
complete molecular remission or relapse and become resistant to
the treatments. Here we discuss the underlying mechanisms and
the potential avenue of targeting a critical histone demethylase
PHF8 in overcoming the treatment resistance in APL and
beyond.
As a result of international collaborative research
efforts, APL has led the way in demonstrating the promises and
defining important principles of successful targeted therapies.
At the same time, it also reveals various challenges that targeted
therapy will face. Among them is the drug resistance that
has taken the central stage. Although the highly specific and
effective way of targeting the critical oncogenic events that
drive the diseases represents a major advantage over the generic
highly toxic chemotherapy, this is a double-edged sword that
also makes targeted therapy particularly susceptible to treatment
resistance. In APL, ATRA specifically binds to and alters
the conformation of oncogenic RARA fusion leading to derepression of downstream targets by epigenetic reprogramming
and subsequent degradation of the fusion proteins, leading to
differentiation of APL blasts (Figure 1a). However, a prolonged
ATRA treatment can result in drug resistance by inducing and/
or selecting leukemic clones carrying mutations on the ligand
binding domain (LBD) of the RARA moiety or aberrant
transcription repression complexes that could not be dissociated
by ATRA treatment (Figure 1b), which are commonly found
in relapse cases. Similar problems also occur in the ATO
treatment. PML-RARA fusion accounts for over 98% of APL.
Mechanistically, ATO binds directly to PML moiety of the PMLRARA fusion that induces direct cross linking, SUMOylation
and subsequent degradation of the fusion protein. In contrast
to ATRA, a high dose of ATO triggers apoptosis of APL cells
without a significant induction of differentiation (Figure 1c).
Although ATO has been successfully used both in combination
with ATRA for induction therapy and as a second line treatment
for ATRA-resistance, mutations on the PML moiety of the
RARA fusion affecting the ATO-induced protein degradation
can be found in APL cells after ATO treatment (Figure 1d).
Moreover APL patients carrying double mutations affecting both
ATRA binding and ATO-mediated degradation have also been
reported, indicating that a better therapeutic strategy is urgently
needed to prevent and/or overcome the treatment resistance.
While targeting oncogenic transcription factors with
small molecule inhibitors has been proved difficult, their
associated epigenetic modifying enzymes such as histone
deacetylase and DNA methyltransferases with rigid catalytic

Figure 1: Schematic diagram illustrates the molecular basis of ATRA/ATO treatments and the potential avenues
of overcoming treatment resistance by modulating PHF8 activity in APL. PML-RARA aberrantly recruits co-repressor

complexes (Co-R, yellow oval) and epigenetically suppresses expression of downstream target genes critical for differentiation and tumor
suppression.
(a) ATRA (red triangle) binds to the LBD of RARA moiety and facilitates the exchange of co-repressor with co-activator complexes (co-A,
pink oval). ATRA also induces phosphorylation of PHF8 that is recruited by the RARA fusion to remove suppressive H3K9me epigenetic
mark and subsequently converts repressive chromatin (red H3 oval) to permissive chromatin (green H3 oval) for active transcriptional
programs leading to cell differentiation.
(b) However, long-term exposure to ATRA may cause selection or induction of leukemic clones carrying mutations on the LBD of the
RARA moiety or aberrant transcription repression complexes that could not be dissociated by pharmacological level of ATRA treatment.
Hence cells become ATRA-resistant and APL relapses.
(c) On the other hand, ATO (red diamond) that leads to degradation of PML-RARA has been shown effective in inducing complete
remissions even for ATRA-resistant APL (thin dashed orange arrow). In contrast to ATRA, a high dose of ATO results in apoptosis of APL
cells .
(d) Again, long-term treatment of ATO can select/induce resistant leukemic clone(s) carrying mutations on
the PML moiety affecting ATO-mediated degradation.
ATO-resistant clone expands and disease relapses.
(e) and (f) Over-expression or hyperphosphorylation of PHF8 (red), which could be achieved by phosphatase inhibitor OA treatment,
re-sensitizes ATRA-resistant APL to ATRA, probably through epigenetic activation of downstream target gene expression (e). Since ATOresistance in APL is largely due to the mutation on PML moiety, PHF8 can still in principle be effective in targeting the RARA moiety of
the fusion proteins and induces cell differentiation (f).
