ABSTRACT:
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) signaling axis plays a central role in cell proliferation, growth, and survival
under physiological conditions. However, aberrant PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling has been
implicated in many human cancers, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
Therefore, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network is considered as a validated target for innovative
cancer therapy. The limit of acceptable toxicity for standard polychemotherapy has
been reached in AML. Novel therapeutic strategies are therefore needed. This review
highlights how the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis is constitutively active in AML
patients, where it affects survival, proliferation, and drug-resistance of leukemic cells
including leukemic stem cells. Effective targeting of this pathway with small molecule
kinase inhibitors, employed alone or in combination with other drugs, could result in
the suppression of leukemic cell growth. Furthermore, targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling network with small pharmacological inhibitors, employed either alone or in
combinations with other drugs, may result in less toxic and more efficacious treatment
of AML patients. Efforts to exploit pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
cascade which show efficacy and safety in the clinical setting are now underway.

INTRODUCTION

dose polychemotherapy, consisting of cytarabine and an
anthracycline antibiotic like daunorubicin or idarubicin,
or the anthracendione mitoxantrone [2]. While results of
AML treatment have improved in younger patients who
can tolerate intensified treatment strategies, there have
been limited changes in outcome among individuals who
are older than 60 years. Therefore, the prognosis of AML
remains severe, with an overall 5-year survival rate around
20%, despite continuous advances in our understanding
of AML biology. Furthermore, patients with AML arising
out of myelodysplastic syndrome or who are older than 60
years have an even worse prognosis (<10% survival at 5
years) [3]. Therefore, there remains a need for innovative,
rationally designed, minimally toxic, therapies for AML,

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous group of malignant clonal diseases characterized by deregulated proliferation of hematopoietic stem
cells and myeloid progenitors. This results in accumulation, in the bone marrow, of myeloid cells with an impaired
differentiation program and resistant to cell death. AML
accounts for about 80% of adult leukemias and is a disorder of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 65
years and a growing incidence over 65 years [1]. Most
AML cases respond well to initial polychemotherapy, but
disease relapse occurs in the large majority of patients. The
standard therapeutic approach for AML patients is high-

LSCs is still debated, but they are comprised in the CD34+/
CD38-/low population [6]. The majority of LSCs are quiescent and insensitive to traditional chemotherapeutic drugs.
This latter feature explains, at least in part, the difficulties
in eradicating this cell population by conventional polychemotherapy. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies for AML
eradication should also target LSCs [7]. In AML, aberrant
activation of several signal transduction pathways strongly
enhances the proliferation and survival of both LSCs and
CFU-Ls [8, 9]. Therefore, these signaling networks are
attractive targets for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies in AML [10].
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K, a family of
lipid kinases)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling cascade is crucial to many widely divergent
physiological processes which include cell cycle progression, transcription, translation, differentiation, apoptosis,

especially for the elderly [4].
Only one subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), displays a much better prognosis, as differentiation therapy with arsenic trioxide or all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA), used alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, has proven quite successful in APL patients
[5]. It is now clear that a hierarchical organization of the
hematopoietic system does exist in AML, as in normal
hematopoiesis. Indeed, AML is initiated and maintained by
a small, self-renewing population of leukemic stem cells
(LSCs), which give rise to a progeny of more mature and
highly cycling progenitors (colony forming unit-leukemia,
CFU-L). CFU-Ls do not self-renew, however they are committed to proliferation and limited differentiation. By doing
so, they originate a population of blast cells which constitute the majority of leukemic cells in both the bone marrow
and peripheral blood of patients. The exact phenotype of

Fig. 1. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. GPCRs, RTKs, and Ras activate PI3K. PI3K generates PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 from PtdIns (4,5)
P2. PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 attracts to the plasma membrane PDK1 which phosphorylates Akt on Thr308. Full Akt activation requires Ser473 phosphorylation which is effected by mTORC2. Most of the Akt substrates are inactivated by phosphorylation. Active Akt inhibits TSC2 activity
through direct phosphorylation. TSC2 is a GAP that functions in association with TSC1 to inactivate the small G protein Rheb. Akt-driven
TSC1/TSC2 complex inactivation allows Rheb to accumulate in a GTP-bound state. Rheb-GTP then activates the protein kinase activity
of mTORC1. mTORC1 targets p70S6K and 4E-BP1 which are critical for translation. 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 results in the
release of eIF4E, while p70S6K phosphorylates ribosomal S6 protein. The TSC1/2 complex is required to activate also mTORC2. However,
other signaling cascades impinge on mTORC1, including GSK3Œ≤, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2/p90RSK pathway, and the LKB1/AMPK network
which is sensitive to the ADP/ATP ratio. Arrows indicate activating events, whereas perpendicular lines indicate inhibitory events.

motility, and metabolism [11]. However, the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway represents one of the major survival pathways that is deregulated in many human cancers
and contributes to both cancer pathogenesis and therapy
resistance. Over the last few years, it has been reported
that constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network is a common feature of AML patients [12].
Furthermore, pathway activation confers leukemogenic
potential to mouse hematopoietic cells [13]. Therefore, this
signal transduction cascade may represent a valuable target
for innovative therapeutic treatment of AML patients. The
aim of this review is to give the reader an updated overview
of the relevance of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling activation in
AML patients and to focus on small molecules which will
possibly have an impact on the therapeutic arsenal we have
against this disease.

including tumors of the colon, brain, ovary, breast, liver,
and stomach, and could at least partially explain pathway
up-regulation in these neoplasms [21]. Nevertheless, in
tumor models (brain, prostate, breast) driven by PTEN
(phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
10) deficiency, knock-out of p110Œ≤, but not p110Œ±, was
required to inhibit Akt activation [17]. Wild-type p110Œ± is
not oncogenetic when overexpressed, whereas wild-type
p110Œ≤, p110Œ≥, and p110Œ¥ PI3Ks are oncogenetic when
ectopically expressed in chicken fibroblasts [22]. Nevertheless, their contribution to oncogenesis is only beginning to
emerge [23].
Akt
Akt, a 57-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase, is the cellular homolog of the v-akt oncogene. The Akt family comprises three highly conserved isoforms: Akt1/Œ±, Akt2/Œ≤, and
Akt3/Œ≥, which display a high degree of sequence homology
[14]. However, functional differences exist between Akt
isoforms, as Akt2 is involved in insulin-mediated glucose
uptake [24] and in cell motility/invasion/metastatic potential of cancer cells [25].
Akt contains an NH2-terminal PH domain, that interacts
with PtdIns (3,4,5)P3. Once Akt is recruited at the plasma
membrane, its activation loop is phosphorylated on Thr308
by PDK1 while the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylates Ser473 in the Akt COOH-terminus (Figure 1).
Full Akt activation requires both the phosphorylation steps.
Active Akt migrates to both the cytosol and the nucleus.
Nuclear Akt may fulfil important anti-apoptotic roles [26].
Nevertheless, the relative contribution of Akt signaling at
the plasma membrane, the cytosol, and the nucleus remains
to be elucidated. However, it is intriguing that the protein
promyelocytic leukemia (PML) is involved in the dephosphorylation of nuclear Akt as PML specifically recruits the
Akt phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), as well
as phosphorylated Akt into PML nuclear bodies [27]. These
bodies, however, are disrupted by the fusion protein, PMLRARŒ±, which is the hallmark of APL [5, 28]. This could be
one of the reasons for Akt activation which is detected in
APL [29]. Thus, this finding highlights the growing importance of Akt compartmentalization in human cancer pathogenesis and treatment.
So far, over 100 Akt substrates have been identified
[30]. Of these, about 40 which mediate the pleiotropic
Akt functions have been characterized, including Bad,
caspase-9, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), Iƒ∏B kinase
(IKK) Œ±, proline-rich Akt substrate 40-kDa (PRAS40) 40,
the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors, apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 [ASK1, a negative regulator of pro-apoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)], Raf,
p27Kip1, p21Cip1, glycogen synthase kinase 3Œ≤ (GSK3Œ≤ÔÄ©. Each
of these substrates has a key role in the regulation of cell
survival and proliferation, either directly or through an
intermediary [16, 31]. A rare, oncogenetic, activating muta-

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
PI3K
The family of PI3K enzymes is characterized by the
ability to phosphorylate the 3‚Äô-OH group in inositol lipids
and comprises three different classes, I, II, and III. Class
I PI3K preferred substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4,5
bisphosphate [PtdIns (4,5)P2] which is phosphorylated to
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P3]
[14, 15]. PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 recruits to the plasma membrane
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins,
which include phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase
1 (PDK1) and Akt. Class I PI3K is divided further into A
[activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), Ras, and
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)] and B (activated by
GPCRs) subtype (Figure 1). Class IA PI3Ks are heterodimeric enzymes composed of a regulatory (p85Œ±, p85Œ≤,
p55Œ±, p55Œ≥, p50Œ±) and of catalytic (p110Œ±, p110Œ≤, p110Œ¥)
subunits. Class IB PI3K comprises a p101 regulatory and a
p110Œ≥ catalytic subunit [16]. Both p110Œ± and p110Œ≤ PI3K
play fundamental roles during development, so that their
homozygous knockout is embryonic-lethal [17]. In contrast, p110Œ≥ and p110Œ¥ PI3Ks are mostly related to the
immune system functions, so that their knock-down leads
to defective immune responses [18]. Class II PI3Ks, which
comprise the PI3K-C2Œ±, -C2Œ≤, and -C2Œ≥ isoforms, preferentially phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol to yield phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate. Although class II PI3Ks are
widely expressed in mammalian organs and tissues, their
relevance in cell signaling and cancer biology is not clear
at the moment [19].
Vacuolar protein sorting 34 (vps34) is the only class III
PI3K and exists as a heterodimer bound to the vps15 regulatory subunit (previously referred to as p150 in mammals).
Vps34 has been implicated in nutrient signaling, endocytosis, and autophagy [20].
Activating mutations in the gene coding for p110Œ±

membrane and was leukemogenic in mice [32].

release of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). eIF4E
is a key component for translation of 5‚Äô capped mRNAs,
which include transcripts encoding growth promoting molecules, such as c-Myc, cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase
2, retinoblastoma protein, p27Kip1, vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), and signal activator and transducer of transcription 3 (STAT3) [34, 37]. Furthermore,
mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy, a non-apoptotic
form of cell death, which is attracting much attention, as it
could affect sensitivity of tumors (including leukemias) to
various forms of therapy [38].
Akt-mediated regulation of mTORC1 activity involves
several mechanisms. Akt inhibits TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis 2 or hamartin) function through direct phosphorylation. TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) which
associates with TSC1 (Tuberous Sclerosis 1 or tuberin)
for inactivating the small G protein Rheb (Ras homolog
enriched in brain). TSC2 phosphorylation by Akt represses
GAP activity of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, allowing Rheb
to accumulate in a GTP-bound state. The mechanism by
which Rheb-GTP activates mTORC1 has not been fully
elucidated yet, although Rheb requires to be farnesylated
for activating mTORC1 [39]. Thus, it could be inhibited by
farnesyl-trasferase inhibitors (FTIs). Akt also phosphorylates PRAS40, an inhibitor of the interactions between
mTORC1 and its substrates, and by doing so, prevents
PRAS40 ability to suppress mTORC1 signaling [40].
Moreover, PRAS40 is a substrate of mTORC1 itself, and it
has been demonstrated that mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 facilitates the removal of its inhibition
on mTORC1 [41].
Moreover, Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
1/2 signaling positively regulates mTORC1 activity, as
both ERK 1/2 and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) phos-

mTOR
mTOR is an atypical 289-kDa serine/threonine kinase,
originally identified in the yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, that belongs to the PI3K-related kinase family and
displays a COOH-terminal catalytic domain with a high
sequence homology to PI3K (Figure 2). This similarity could explain the cross-inhibition of mTOR by drugs
which target PI3K (see below) [33]. mTOR signaling is
conserved in eukaryotes from plants and yeasts to mammals. mTOR exists as two complexes, referred to as mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. mTORC1 is comprised of mTOR/Raptor/mLST8/PRAS40/FKBP38/Deptor
and is sensitive to rapamycin and its derivatives (rapalogs).
mTORC2 is composed of mTOR/Rictor/mLST8/SIN1/
Protor/Deptor and is generally described as being insensitive to rapamycin/rapalogs, although long-term treatment
of about 20% of cancer cell lines with rapamycin/rapalogs leads to dissociation of mTORC2 [34, 35]. mTORC1
signaling integrates environmental clues (growth factors,
hormones, nutrients, stressors) and information from the
cell metabolic status. Thus, mTORC1 controls anabolic
processes for promoting protein synthesis and cell growth
[36]. mTORC1 regulates translation in response to nutrients/growth factors by phosphorylating components of
the protein synthesis machinery, including p70S6 kinase
(p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). p70S6K phosphorylates the 40S ribosomal
protein, S6, leading to active translation of mRNAs, while
4E-BP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 on several amino
acidic residues (Ser37; Thr46; Ser65; Thr70) results in the

Negative regulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling

phorylate TSC2, thus suppressing its inhibitory function
on Rheb [42] (Figure 1). mTORC1 signal transduction is
inhibited by the master metabolic regulator, energy-sensing
AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), given that AMPK
phosphorylates and activates TSC2 [43].
The mechanisms for mTORC2 regulation have only
begun to be revealed. However, mTORC2 activation
requires PI3K and the TSC1/TSC2 complex, but is independent of Rheb and is largely insensitive to either nutrients
or energy conditions [44]. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on
Ser473 which enhances subsequent Akt phosphorylation
on Thr308 by PDK1 [45]. Moreover, mTORC2 plays a role
in cytoskeleton organization by controlling actin polymerization [46] and phosphorylates protein kinase C (PKC) Œ±
[44]. Another down-stream target of mTORC2 is serumand glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1) [47].
The oncogenetic role of mTORC2 has been recently highlighted by an investigation that documented the importance
of mTORC2 in the development and progression of prostate cancers induced in mice by PTEN loss [48].
Akt and mTORC1/2 are linked to each other via positive and negative regulatory feedback circuits, which
restrain their simultaneous hyperactivation through mechanisms which involve p70S6K and PI3K. Assuming that
an equilibrium exists between mTORC1 and mTORC2,
when mTORC1 is formed, it antagonizes the formation of
mTORC2 and reduces Akt activity. Indeed, once mTORC1
is activated through Akt, the former elicits a negative feedback loop for inhibiting Akt activity [34]. This negative
regulation of Akt activity by mTORC1 is a consequence
of p70S6K-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor
substrate (IRS) 1 adapter protein, downstream of insulin receptor and/or Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Receptor (IGF-1R) [49, 50]. Indeed, IRS-1 phosphorylation on
Ser307 and Ser636/639 by p70S6K targets the adapter
protein to proteasomal degradation [51]. Therefore, at least
in principle, inhibition of mTORC1 activity by rapamycin/rapalogs could result in hyperactivation of both Akt
and its downstream targets. Such a phenomenon has been
documented to occur both in vitro and in vivo [52, 53].
mTORC1 is capable of downregulating also IRS2 expression by enhancing its proteosomal degradation [54]. Consistently, mTORC1 inhibition by the rapalog, RAD001,
increased IRS2 expression and Akt phosphorylation levels
in AML cells [55]. Recent work has also highlighted a
p70S6K-mediated phosphorylation of Rictor on Thr1135.
This phosphorylation event exerted a negative regulatory
effect on the mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt
in vivo [56]. Thus, both mTORC1 and mTORC2 control
Akt activation.
Nevertheless, the extent to which disruption of negative
feedbacks mechanism actually limits the therapeutic effects
of mTOR inhibitors in cancer patients in vivo remains to be
determined [57].

A tight counter-regulation by phosphatases has emerged
as a crucial process to control PI3K/Akt/mTOR-dependent
signaling. PTEN is a dual specificity lipid/protein phosphatase that preferentially removes the 3‚Äô-phosphate mainly
from PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 but is also active on phosphatidylinositol 3,4 bisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4)P2], thereby antagonizing network signaling [58, 59]. PTEN silencing or
inactivating mutations have been detected in a wide variety
of human neoplasias (including prostatic and endometrium
carcinomas, glioblastomas, melanoma, and T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia [60]) and this results in Akt/mTOR
up-regulation. SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 (for Src homology
domain-containing inositol phosphatase) are phosphatases
capable of removing the 5-phosphate from PtdIns (3,4,5)P3
to yield PtdIns (3,4)P2 [61]. An important role for SHIP-1
in normal hematopoiesis has been recently described [62,
63]. PP2A, which is now considered to be an oncosuppressor, down-regulates Akt activity, through dephosphorylation of Thr308 [64]. Thr308 and Ser473 residues of Akt are
also targeted by the two isoforms (1 and 2) of PH domain
leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) [65].
Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signals in AML
From 50% to 80% of patients with AML display Akt
phosphorylated on either Thr308 or Ser473 (or both) [6671]. Both the disease-free survival and the overall survival
were significantly shorter in AML cases where pathway
up-regulation was documented [70, 72-74]. Poor prognosis
of AML patients with elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could be also related to the fact that this pathway controls the expression of the membrane ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter, multidrug resistance-associated protein
1, which extrudes chemotherapeutic drugs from leukemic
cells and is usually associated with a lower survival rate
[75, 76].
Nevertheless, a more recent report has highlighted that
constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could
be a favourable prognostic factor in de novo cases of AML.
One hypothesis for the lower relapse rate in patients with
enhanced PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is that it could drive
immature leukemic cells (LSCs and CFU-L) into S phase,
thus rendering them more susceptible to polychemotherapy
[77].
Causes of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling up-regulation in
AML may be the result of several factors, including activating mutations of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor
[71] and c-Kit tyrosine kinase receptor [78], N- or K-Ras
mutations [79], PI3K p110Œ≤ and/or Œ¥ overexpression [8082], low levels of PP2A [70], autocrine/paracrine secretion
of growth factors such as IGF-1 [82-84] and VEGF [85,
86]. Overexpression of PDK1 has been reported in 45%
of a cohort of 66 AML patients, however it was related to
93

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 89-103

PKC hyperphosphorylation, while the relationship (if any)
with Thr308 Akt up-regulation was not investigated [87].
Interactions between leukemic cells and bone marrow stromal cells through CXCR4 (a GPCR which is abundantly
expressed on leukemic cell surface where it is up-regulated
by hypoxic conditions [88, 89]) and its physiological ligand,
CXCL12, produced by stromal cells [89, 90], could result
in PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation [91]. Furthermore, interactions between Œ≤1 integrins on AML cells and stromal fibronectin could lead to pathway activation [92, 93], possibly
through up-regulation of integrin-linked kinase 1 (ILK1)
which is involved in Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 in a
PI3K-dependent manner in AML cells [94]. The ability of
ILK1 to function as a Ser473 Akt kinase could be related to
the fact that ILK1 interacted with Rictor and was required
for Akt phosphorylation by mTORC2 on Ser473 [95]. Possible causes of pathway activation in AML cells are highlighted in Figure 3.
No activating mutations in p110Œ± PI3K [96] or Akt1
PH domain [70, 97] have been detected so far in AML
patients. Although PTEN is deleted in many solid cancers
and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, PTEN deletion
is extremely rare in AML [66, 69, 70]. PTEN can be inactivated by post-translational mechanisms, including phos-

phorylation at the COOH-terminal regulatory domain.
This phosphorylative event stabilizes PTEN molecule but
makes it less active towards PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, thus resulting
in Akt up-regulation [98]. PTEN phosphorylation has been
reported in AML patients where it was significantly associated with high levels of p-Akt and with shorter overall survival [99]. However, subsequent studies could not confirm
these findings [70, 74]. A reassessment of the PTEN role in
AML could be important, as in mice, hematopoietic stem
cells without functional PTEN, began multiplying rapidly,
showed diminished self-renewal capacity, and started to
move out of the bone marrow, colonizing distant organs,
and originating a leukemic-like disease [100, 101]. Of note,
these effects were mostly mediated by mTOR, as rapamycin not only depleted LSCs, but also restored normal hematopoietic stem cell function [101].
It is conceivable that several concomitant extrinsic and
intrinsic causes converge to activate PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in AML patients, even if this fundamental issue has
not been thoroughly investigated. Indeed, in the only published study, it was demonstrated that, in a small cohort of
patients, overexpression of PI3K p110Œ¥ [81] could coexist
with activating FLT3 and Ras mutations. It has also been
reported that mTORC1 activation was independent of PI3K/

Fig. 3. Constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in AML cells. In this cartoon, mutated (Mut) C-Kit, FLT3, or Ras,
and autocrine/paracrine secretion of growth factors (VEGF, IGF-1) impinge upon increased levels of p110Œ≤ and/or
p110Œ¥ PI3K. This results in high levels of PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 synthesized at the plasma membrane from PtdIns (4,5)P2.
PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 recruits at the plasma membrane both PDK1 and inactive Akt (Akt off). PDK1 phoshorylates Akt on
Thr308, whereas phosphorylation on Ser473 is driven by mTORC2. These two phosphorylative events fully activates
Akt (Akt on). Bone marrow stromal cells secrete CXCL12 and fibronectin. Fibronectin, by interacting with Œ≤ integrins,
could activate ILK which, in turn, stimulates mTORC2 activity on Ser473 Akt. CXCL12 binds its receptor CXCR4,
a GPCR which results in increased PI3K activity. Bone marrow stromal cells could also secrete VEGF and IGF-1.
Activated Akt migrates to both nucleus and cytosol to phosphorylate its substrates.

Akt activity in AML patients [55]. In some AML cases, it
has been documented that either MEK/ERK 1/2 [102] or
Lyn signaling [103] could be up-stream of mTORC1. TSC2
gene expression was found to be down-regulated in AML
patients, most likely due to promoter hypermethylation.
However, it is not known if it impinged on mTORC1 activation [104].
It should be emphasized here that PI3K/Akt/mTOR network up-regulation has been detected not only in the bulk of
the AML blasts, but also in LSCs transplanted in non-obese
diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID)
mice, where it exerted a powerful pro-survival effect. This
finding suggests that therapeutic targeting of this pathway
has the potential for eradicating AML [105].

PI3K inhibitors more suitable for clinical use are currently
underway [110].
Several selective inhibitors of p110 PI3K isoforms are
now available [111]. IC87114 is a compound that selectively inhibits the p110Œ¥ isoform of PI3K. IC87114 downregulated p-Akt and p-FOXO3a, reduced proliferation, and
induced apoptosis in AML primary cells overexpressing
p110Œ¥ÔÄ†PI3K. Moreover, it synergized with etoposide [81].
In primary APL cells, both IC87114 and TGX-115 (a p110Œ≤
PI3K-selective inhibitor) triggered apoptosis in the presence or in the absence of the differentiating agent, ATRA
[29].
Conceivably, the use of selective PI3K isoform inhibitors could be associated with less undesirable side effects
than the use of broad spectrum PI3K inhibitors [111]. For
example, it is established that insulin control of glucose
homeostasis is mainly mediated through p110Œ± PI3K [112]
and, to a much lower extent, by p110Œ≤ PI3K [113].

Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR module in AML
Either used alone or in combination with other drugs,
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitors have been proven
useful for down-regulating cell proliferation and inducing
apoptosis in pre-clinical settings of AML, using cell lines
or animal models. However, clinical trials of these compounds are limited. We shall now highlight some compounds which have been used for targeting PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling in AML cells.

Akt inhibitors
Perifosine is a zwitterionic, water soluble, synthetic
alkylphosphocholine with oral bioavailability that inhibits
Akt phosphorylation through interaction with the Akt PH
domain, resulting in disruption of its membrane targeting.
Interestingly, recent evidence has documented that perifosine targets both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity by downregulating the levels of mTOR, raptor, rictor, p70S6K,
and 4E-BP1, owing to their enhanced degradation [114].
Perifosine reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis
accompanied by Akt dephosphorylation in a wide variety
of neoplasias, including AML [115]. Perifosine synergized
with etoposide in AML blasts, and reduced the clonogenic
activity of CD34+ cells from leukemic patients, but not from
healthy donors [116]. Moreover, perifosine synergized
with histone deacetylase inhibitors [117] or pro-apoptotic
TRAIL (TNF-related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand) in AML
cell lines and primary cells displaying Akt constitutive activation [118]. However, perifosine also targeted the MER/
ERK 1/2 pro-survival pathway and activated pro-apoptotic
JNK, [116-120] therefore it could not be considered specific for the Akt pathway. A phase 1 clinical trial combining
perifosine and UCN-01 (a staurosporine derivative which
inhibits PDK1) (NCT00301938) and a phase II clinical
trial with perifosine alone (NCT00391560) have been performed in patients with refractory/relapsed AML, but the
results have not yet been disclosed.
Akt-I-1/2, a synthetic reversible allosteric inhibitor, is
an Akt1/Akt2 isoform-specific inhibitor that forms a PH
domain-dependent inactive conformation with Akt1 and
Akt2 [121]. Akt-I-1/2 inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenic properties, and induced apoptosis in AML cells
with high-risk cytogenetic changes/abnormalities [70].
However, it is at present unknown which Akt isoforms are
expressed by AML blasts.

PI3K inhibitors
Wortmannin and LY294002 are the best characterized
PI3K inhibitors that have been widely used as research
tools to elucidate the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
in various tumor cells. Both inhibitors are cell-permeable
and low molecular weight compounds. Wortmannin is a
natural metabolite produced by Penicillium wortmanni and
inhibits all class PI3K members with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in vitro of 2-5 nM, while inhibiting other
kinases [mTOR, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK), and ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase] with higher
IC50 values [106]. It is interesting that DNA-PK was found
to phosphorylate Akt on Ser473 under conditions of DNA
damage [107].
LY294002 is a flavonoid-based synthetic compound and
inhibits PI3K with an IC50 of 1-20 ŒºM. However, LY294002
blocks not only PI3K activity but also mTOR, DNA-PK,
Pim kinase, polo-like kinase, and CK2 to the same extent
as PI3K [106]. Both wortmannin and LY294002 bind to
the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, leading to the blockade
of ATP bound to the active portion. PI3K inhibition with
LY294002 is reversible and ATP-competitive while wortmannin irreversibly inhibits PI3K in a non-ATP-competitive manner [106].
Wortmannin and LY294002 have been used in preclinical models of AML where they displayed powerful
cytotoxic effects in vitro [66, 79, 108, 109]. Since the insolubility in aqueous solutions and high toxicity of both inhibitors precluded their clinical application, efforts to develop

mTOR inhibitors
mTOR inhibitors are by far the most developed class
of compounds which target the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
They include: rapamycin (sirolimus, a macrolide derived
from the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus, originally
discovered in a soil sample collected on Easter Island) and
its derivatives CCI-779 (temsirolimus), RAD001 (everolimus), and AP23573 (deforolimus) [122]. Temsirolimus
was approved by US Food and Drug Administration in
2007 for the first-line treatment of poor prognosis patients
with advanced renal cell carcinoma. The overall survival of
treated patients was increased by nearly 50% (~ 3 months)
relative to the control group [123]. Some clinical benefits of
rapamycin/rapalogs have been reported also against endometrial carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma, however, the
overall objective response rates in major solid tumors have
been modest [124].
Rapamycin and rapalogs do not target the catalytic site
of mTORC1, but rather bind its immunophilin, FK506
binding protein 12 (FKBP12) (Figure 2). The rapamycin/
FKBP12 complex then binds mTORC1 and inhibits downstream signaling events [125]. Thus, rapamycin and rapalogs act as allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors. Recent evidence
has documented that complex formation with FKBP12 is
not an absolute requirement for repression of mTORC1
activity by rapamycin/rapalogs, however, in the absence
of FKBP12, the drugs display a 100 to 1000-fold lower
potency than in the presence of the immunophilin [126].
Available data suggest that rapamycin treatment, over
long time periods, also targets mTORC2 [127]. Accordingly, both CCI-779 and RAD001 (10-20 nM) inhibited
Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 in AML cells in vitro and
in patients in vivo after a 24 h incubation, through suppression of the mTORC2 assembly [128]. In contrast, it has
been documented that RAD001 (10 nM for 24 h) increased
Akt phosphorylation in vitro on Ser473 in AML samples
displaying constitutive PI3K/Akt activation [55]. Since a
neutralizing monoclonal antibody to the IGF-1R Œ±-subunit,
reversed the RAD001-induced increase of Akt phosphorylation and RAD001 treatment led to a significant increase
in IRS2 protein expression, it was concluded that p-Akt upregulation could be explained by the existence of an IGF-1/
IGF-1R autocrine loop, as well as by increased expression
of IRS2. At present, it is not easy to reconcile these contradictory findings.
Rapamycin had only a modest effect on primary AML
cell survival in liquid culture, however, it markedly downregulated AML blast clonogenicity while sparing normal
hematopoietic precursors [129]. Accordingly, others have
reported that rapamycin led to only a slight decrease in
AML blast survival in short term cultures, whereas in long
term cultures the effect was more pronounced [105]. These
results suggested that the target of rapamycin is the proliferating contingent of the leukemic clone, rather than the
bulk of AML blasts which are predominantly blocked in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/

G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.
However, rapamycin cytotoxicity in short term cultures could be dramatically increased by co-treatment with
etoposide. Importantly, etoposide toxicity on CD34+ cells
from healthy donors was not enhanced by addition of rapamycin. Of note, co-incubation with rapamycin enhanced
etoposide-mediated decrease in the engraftment of AML
cells in NOD/SCID mice, suggesting the drugs also targeted putative LCSs [105].
The rapalog RAD001 synergized with both ATRA and
histone acetylase inhibitors in inducing growth arrest and
differentiation of APL cell lines [130, 131].
A few phase I/II clinical trials with rapamycin and rapalogs have been performed in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Rapamycin induced a partial response in 4 of 9
adult patients with de novo or secondary AML, who displayed activation of mTORC1 signaling, as documented by
increased levels of p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP1 [129]. RAD001
has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in patients with
relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, including
AML [132]. However, no AML patients achieved a complete or even partial response. AP23573 has been tested in
a phase II study in 22 patients with AML [133]. Only one
patient displayed an objective hematological improvement,
consisting of normalization of neutrophils. A significant
reduction in mTORC1 activity was observed in response
to the drug, as documented by decreased p-4E-BP1 levels.
A recent phase I study in which rapamycin was combined
with MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine) polychemotherapy failed to demonstrate any synergistic effect
of the combination in relapsed/refractory AML patients,
even if proof of rapamycin biological activity in vivo was
detected, consisting in the dephosphorylation of p70S6K
[134]. Several clinical trials with rapamycin/rapalogs combined with chemotherapeutic agents are now underway in
AML patients [135].
Moreover, a phase I study has recently documented
the efficacy, in elderly AML patients, of the combination
etoposide and tipifarnib (R11577, an FTI). Intriguingly,
the effect of tipifarnib was not always related to Ras inhibition, but rather to inhibition of Rheb farnesylation and,
consequently, of mTORC1 signaling, as documented by
decreased levels of p-p70S6K and of its substrate, p-S6
[136].
Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
The rationale for using dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors is
that mTORC1 allosteric inhibitors, such as rapamycin/rapalogues, could hyperactivate Akt through p70S6K/PI3K,
as discussed earlier in this review. Moreover, it is now
emerging that rapamycin/rapalogs have only modest efficacy on total translation rates, and the effects are cell-type
specific. In contrast, small molecules designed for inhibiting the catalytic site of mTOR, were much more effective
in this respect, especially in cancer cells [137-141]. Such
96

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 89-103

a phenomenon has been recently reported to occur also in
AML cells, where rapamycin was unable to block protein
synthesis, owing to a failure in inducing 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation [142]. Furthermore, in some AML cases,
mTORC1 activity does not seem to be under the control of
PI3K/Akt, despite concomitant PI3K/Akt activation [103].
Therefore, the use of a single inhibitor which targets both
PI3K and mTORC1 catalytic sites could present substantial
advantages over drugs which only target either PI3K/Akt
or mTORC1. PI-103 is a pyridonylfuranopyrimidine class
synthetic molecule that represses the activity of both class
IA and IB PI3Ks, as well as of mTORC1/mTORC2 [143,
144]. Two papers have documented the efficacy of PI-103
in pre-clinical settings of AML. It has been reported that
PI-103, which itself displayed only modest pro-apoptotic
activity, acted synergistically with Nutlin-3 (an MDM2
inhibitor) [145, 146], to induce apoptosis in a wild-type
p53-dependent fashion in AML cell lines and primary cells
[147]. Another group demonstrated that PI-103 was mainly
cytostatic for AML cell lines. However, in AML blast cells,
PI-103 inhibited leukemic proliferation and CFU-L clonogenicity, induced mitochondrial apoptosis, and synergized
with etoposide [148]. Of note, PI-103 was not apoptogenic
in CD34+ cells from healthy donors and had only moderate effects on their clonogenic and proliferative activities.
Since either RAD001 or IC87114 did not induce apoptosis
in AML primary cells, it was concluded that dual-targeted
therapy against PI3K/Akt and mTOR with PI-103 may be
of therapeutic value in AML [148].
Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the new frontier in
mTOR inhibition will be represented by the second generation, ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors which bind
the active site of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 [137-140].
These drugs target mTOR signaling functions in a global
way, so that they are expected to yield a deeper and broader
antitumor response in the clinic. However, global inhibition of mTOR is expected to be accompanied by greater
toxicity to normal cells [149].

effective target in the pathway, and whether combinations
of horizontal or vertical blockade of the signaling cascade
may be more effective than blocking at a single node [150].
As with all molecularly targeted approaches, pharmacodynamic markers are necessary to direct therapeutic
development of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors. Hence, clinical trials should examine the inhibitor effects on PI3K/Akt/
mTOR targets to establish the best predictor of response
[151]. However, no predictive markers for AML patients
with a high probability of responding to PI3K/Akt/mTOR
inhibition, or biomarkers of dose/efficacy, have been validated. Quantitative flow cytometry appears particularly
well suited for this kind of analysis, because it offers obvious advantages over other techniques (western blot, for
example), including quickness, a much lower number of
cells required to perform the assay, and the possibility of
identifying different subclones in the leukemic population
by co-immunostaining with multiple antibodies to surface
antigens. Accordingly, flow cytometry is rapidly becoming
the choice analytical technique to study PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway activation in AML patients [70, 133, 152, 153].
Another promising quantitative technique requiring a limited number of cells, which has been already applied to the
study of AML patients samples, is represented by reversephase protein arrays [74].
It is highly unlikely that inhibition of a single signaling pathway will achieve long-lasting remissions or cure in
AML, especially for refractory/relapsed patients. However,
combining PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors with conventional
chemotherapy drugs, differentiation inducers (ATRA and/or
arsenic trioxide), or innovative (e.g. TRAIL) agents could
be a very effective therapeutic option for AML patients, as
indicated by results obtained in pre-clinical settings.
The spectacular effect of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients in the chronic phase of the
disease [154], has fed optimism that modulators of signal
transduction networks might be very effective also in other
types of cancer. However, clinical trials performed with
small molecules targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
have mostly given a disappointing outcome. This fact has
led to the suggestion that imatinib success in CML may be
the exception and not the rule, because imatinib is one of
the few examples of a drug targeting the anomaly which
constitutes the underlying pathologic event in the formation of the disorder [155]. Human cancers are known to
evolve through a multistage process which can extend over
a period of several years. Therefore, they progressively
accumulate mutations and epigenetic anomalies in expression of multiple genes [156]. As a consequence, neoplastic
disorders are characterized by multiple signaling abnormalities and the deregulated pathways are extremely redundant. Furthermore, the hierarchy of anomalies has not been
established in many tumors. Therefore, it could be very difficult to find the right target or combinations of target.

CONCLUSIONS
In this review, we have documented that the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway influences proliferation, survival, and drug
resistance of AML cells. However, there still are many
unresolved problems regarding the relevance of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway up-regulation and its druggability in AML
patients. We have a very limited knowledge of the downstream targets (genes/proteins) of this pathway in AML
cells. Therefore, more detailed investigations of these targets are highly desirable. Indeed, data emerging from gene
expression and proteome/phosphoproteome analysis could
pave the way for functional studies which could then provide valuable information for improving future therapeutic
strategies. At present, we do not know what is the most

AML is no exception to this rule. However, the continuous development of molecularly targeted drugs displaying
higher selectivity, coupled with additional mechanistic
studies and advances in profiling the signaling networks of
cancer cells, should make it possible to exploit deregulation
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade to achieve more effective
and less toxic therapies for AML.
