Abstract
Genetic and molecular studies suggest that activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) plays an important role in
vascular development, remodeling, and pathologic angiogenesis. Here we investigated the role of ALK1 in
angiogenesis in the context of common proangiogenic factors [PAF; VEGF-A and basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF)]. We observed that PAFs stimulated ALK1-mediated signaling, including Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation,
nuclear translocation and Id-1 expression, cell spreading, and tubulogenesis of endothelial cells (EC). An
antibody specifically targeting ALK1 (anti-ALK1) markedly inhibited these events. In mice, anti-ALK1 suppressed Matrigel angiogenesis stimulated by PAFs and inhibited xenograft tumor growth by attenuating both
blood and lymphatic vessel angiogenesis. In a human melanoma model with acquired resistance to a VEGF
receptor kinase inhibitor, anti-ALK1 also delayed tumor growth and disturbed vascular normalization
associated with VEGF receptor inhibition. In a human/mouse chimera tumor model, targeting human
ALK1 decreased human vessel density and improved antitumor efficacy when combined with bevacizumab
(anti-VEGF). Antiangiogenesis and antitumor efficacy were associated with disrupted co-localization of ECs with
desminþ perivascular cells, and reduction of blood flow primarily in large/mature vessels as assessed by
contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. Thus, ALK1 may play a role in stabilizing angiogenic vessels and contribute
to resistance to anti-VEGF therapies. Given our observation of its expression in the vasculature of many human
tumor types and in circulating ECs from patients with advanced cancers, ALK1 blockade may represent
an effective therapeutic opportunity complementary to the current antiangiogenic modalities in the clinic.

Introduction
Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is a type I TGFb
receptor subclass with distinct expression, signaling, and
functional properties from other family receptors (1, 2). It
is preferentially expressed on proliferating vascular endothelial cells (EC). Genetic studies of ALK1/ mice and zebrafish
harboring a loss-of-function mutation demonstrated that
ALK1 plays a key role in vasculogenesis, particularly in vessel
maturation involving recruitment and differentiation of perivascular cells (PC), and in the organization and patency of
neo-angiogenic vessels (3–6). In humans, type 2 hereditary
hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT2), an autosomal dominant
vascular dysplasia syndrome, is linked to the loss-of-function
mutations of ALK1 (7, 8).
ALK1 is phosphorylated upon forming a membrane complex with TGFb and its type II receptor, which then phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smad proteins (Smad1/5/
8). Phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (pSmads) dimerize with
Smad4, and the complex translocates to the nucleus triggering

Anti-ALK1 in Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth

transcriptional regulation of target genes that regulate EC
function and angiogenesis (9–12).
Early studies showed that ALK1 signaling is context-dependent and can be either pro- or anti-angiogenic (11–16). Recent
reports revealed that ALK1 signaling promoted angiogenesis
through a synergistic action of TGFb and bone morphogenesis
protein 9 (17); furthermore, a soluble ALK1/extracellular
domain (ECD) Fc-fusion protein (RAP-041) reduced xenograft
tumor burden in mice through antiangiogenesis (18). These
studies suggest that ALK1 is proangiogenic.
During angiogenesis, many proangiogenic factors (PAF),
including VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF),
are coordinately overexpressed by tumor, stromal, and infiltrating myeloid cells (19–25). An association between VEGF
expression/activity and ALK1 dysregulation in HHT syndrome
has been suggested (7, 8, 15, 26, 27), although the molecular
and cellular mechanisms of this relationship remain unclear.
This study aimed to verify the proangiogenic role of ALK1
and elucidate its relationship with VEGF in tumor angiogenesis via pharmacologic approaches utilizing ALK1-specific
monoclonal antibodies (mAb).

Materials and Methods
Cells and tissues
Human ECs were obtained from Clonetics and cultured in
EGM-2 containing serum and a cocktail of growth factors
(Lonza). Human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) were from
Sigma. Human melanoma M24met cells were described
previously (28). Human breast cancer MBA-MD-231/Luc
cells were from Xenogen Corp. Human peripheral blood
samples were collected with informed consent and local
Institutional Review Board approval. ALK1 expression in
circulating ECs (CEC) was assessed according to a modified
protocol using Alexa Fluor–labeled anti-human ALK1 (29).
See Supplementary Materials for human tumor and normal
tissue specimens.
Reagents and animals
Anti-human ALK1 mAb [Anti-huALK1 (PF-03446962)] was
generated by immunizing human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2transgenic XenoMouse (30). The antibody potently and selectively binds to human ALK1 with an affinity (Kd) of 7  2
nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The murine anti-ALK1 mAb
(Anti-muALK1) was generated from mouse hybridoma. AmuVEGF [mAb against human (hu) and murine (mu) VEGF-A],
sunitinib [inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
and several other RTKs], and PF-00337210 (selective inhibitor
of VEGF RTKs) were generated at Pfizer. Bevacizumab (antihuVEGF-A) was from Henry Shein. ALK1/ECD Fc-fusion
protein and growth factors were from R&D Systems. Supplementary Table A describes these agents in detail. All mAbs
were dosed subcutaneously once weekly (QW), and RTK
inhibitors were dosed orally (PO) once daily (QD).
In vitro tubulogenesis assays
ECs and MRC-5 cells were seeded in PAF-reduced Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) and treated with testing agents and stimuli

diluted in endothelial basal medium (EBM)-2 containing 5%
FBS. The supernatant was changed every 3 days. At day 9, cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with antihuCD31 mAb (Santa Cruz) and Alexa Fluor 488–labeled goat
anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Images were captured using
Cellomics (Thermo Scientific) and quantified using ImagePro Plus (Media Cybernetics). See Supplementary Methods for
other in vitro assays.
In vivo models
See Supplementary Materials for mice used in in vivo
studies and general information on conventional xenograft
models. For the chimera tumor model, 50 mL of 2  106
M24met cells mixed with collagen IV and human fibronectin
(both BD Biosciences) were intradermally injected into human
neonatal foreskin engrafted in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (31). Tumor volumes (TV) were calculated according to 0.5  [length  width2]. Antitumor efficacy
was calculated according to [1  DTreat/DControl]  100,
where DTreat and DControl were average tumor volume
changes during the treatment period for the treated and
control groups, respectively.
Immunofluorescence staining
Frozen chimera tumor sections (20 mm) were blocked with
5% rabbit serum/0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.3%
Triton X-100/PBS. huALK1 was stained with a goat antiALK1 antibody (Santa Cruz); CD31 was stained with an Alexa
Fluor 488–labeled anti-huCD31 antibody (BioLegend) or a rat
anti-muCD31 clone (MEC 13.3; BD Biosciences). Murine lymphatic vessels were stained with antibody against LYVE-1
(Abcam). The corresponding Alexa Fluor–labeled secondary
antibodies were from Invitrogen. Slides were counter-stained
with DAPI (40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories) and images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert
200M microscope and an AxioCam HR color digital camera.
For quantification, 3 to 5 "hotspot" areas were captured for
each slide by at least 2 individuals. Images were analyzed and
quantified using Image-Pro Plus.
For perivascular marker staining, tumor sections were
coincubated with sheep anti-huCD31 (R&D Systems) and
rabbit anti-desmin (Millipore) antibodies, followed by Alexa
Fluor–labeled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Threedimensional Z-stack images were captured with a Zeiss
AxioPlan 2 microscope using AxioVision 4.8 (Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging). Image reconstruction and surface rendering
were done using the 3D Constructor 5.1 plug-in for ImagePro Plus.
Ultrasound measurements
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US) images were
acquired using an Acuson Sequoia 512 system (Siemens
Medical Solutions), with a 15L8 linear array transducer (32).
Time required for each pixel of the tumor to return to 20% of
the original amplitude (T20%) was assessed and values were
binned in 1.5-second increments.

followed by a 45-minute stimulation with 2.5% FBS. pSmads were detected by Western blotting. b-Actin was used as loading control (n ¼ 2). Bottom,
cells were treated as above and the Id-1 transcript in the presence of 0.3 of EGM-2 BulletKit (Lonza; 30-minute stimulation) was measured by quantitative
RT-PCR. Shown are fitted curves of dose-dependent inhibition of Id-1 by Anti-huALK1 from 3 experiments. B, cells were starved for 2 to 4 hours and incubated
with Anti-huALK1 (200 nmol/L) for an additional 1 to 2 hours before a 45-minute stimulation with VEGF (10 ng/mL), bFGF (30 mg/mL), or TGFb (1 ng/mL).
pSmads and Id-1 were detected by Western blotting. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was probed as loading control (n ¼ 3).
C, cells were treated as in B, permeabilized, and stained for pSmads (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) to indicate the presence of cells after
Anti-huALK1 (n ¼ 2). D, cells and the experiment details were the same as in B, except that VEGF and TGFb were used as stimuli, and sunitinib (50 nmol/L)
and ALK1/ECD (200 nmol/L) were also used as inhibitors in the assay (n ¼ 3).

Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise noted, the statistical significance in mean
values was determined by one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with a Dunnett's multiple-comparison posttest (GraphPad Prism). A value of P < 0.05 is considered significant.

Results
Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway can be inhibited by AntihuALK1
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used
to investigate ALK1 signaling and functional activity due to
their relatively high-level surface ALK1 expression compared

with other EC lines (Supplementary Fig. 1B and C). Western
blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays
showed that Anti-huALK1 dose-dependently inhibited
serum-stimulated pSmads and Id-1 expression in HUVECs,
respectively (Fig. 1A).
To understand the role of ALK1 in tumor-associated
angiogenesis, we examined whether PAFs could regulate
ALK1 signaling. VEGF and bFGF rapidly induced pSmads
and Id-1 in HUVECs as assessed by Western blotting, and
these signals were blocked by Anti-huALK1 (Fig. 1B). AntihuALK1 also attenuated VEGF and bFGF-stimulated
pSmads translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 1C). Thus, in
addition to TGFb (a known ALK1 ligand), VEGF and bFGF

may also activate Smads and Id-1 in an ALK1-dependent
manner.
To address whether VEGF canonical signaling was involved
in modulating ALK1 downstream components, we applied
sunitinib in the signaling assay and observed that sunitinib
significantly suppressed pSmads and Id-1 stimulated by
VEGF or TGFb. These downstream molecules were also
inhibited by an ALK1/ECD fusion protein in the same assay
(Fig. 1D). These results imply a close interplay between the
VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and TGFb/ALK1 pathways.
Anti-huALK1 inhibits PAF-mediated EC proliferation
and tubule formation
We next investigated whether PAFs contribute to ALK1mediated EC function. First, using an electronic cell sensor
assay (RT-CES, Roche), in which cellular phenotypical changes
were measured in real time (see Supplementary Methods), we

www.aacrjournals.org

observed that Anti-huALK1 rapidly inhibited PAF-stimulated
HUVEC attachment and spreading (Fig. 2A; Supplementary
Fig. 2A). Longer incubation (up to 15 hours) had a similar
result (data not shown). Second, in a coculture assay, we
observed that Anti-huALK1 significantly inhibited VEGF-stimulated EC tubulogenesis (Fig. 2B and C); tubulogenesis
under bFGF and TGFb was moderately inhibited by AntihuALK1. Anti-huALK1 also inhibited VEGF- and bFGFmediated tubulogenesis by human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) in the coculture assay (Supplementary
Fig. 2B). Thus, VEGF and bFGF can promote EC phenotypical
function in an ALK1-dependent manner, consistent with their
ability to stimulate ALK1 signaling.
ALK1 promotes tumor growth via angiogenesis
In the AngioReactor model containing PAFs, a mAb against
murine ALK1 (Anti-muALK1) significantly inhibited murine

Anti-ALK1 in Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth

angiogenesis (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. 3A). Anti-muALK1
produced significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of MDAMB-231 human breast cancer xenograft tumors, in which
muALK1 was found to be expressed in the vasculature and
co-localized with muCD31 (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. 3B).
The TGI was associated with substantial reduction of microvessel density (muCD31 staining) and moderate inhibition of
murine lymphatic vessel density (LYVE-1 staining; Fig. 3B).
This is consistent with the observation that human lymphatic
ECs express ALK1 (Supplementary Fig. 1C) and that ALK1
signaling is involved in multiple stages of lymphatic development in mice (6). Thus, ALK1 promoted murine blood and
lymphatic angiogenesis and xenograft tumor growth.
To investigate whether huALK1 can promote human
vessel function during tumor growth, we used a human/
mouse chimera tumor model, in which local human angiogenesis was attained in the presence of human melanoma
tumors grown in human foreskin engrafted in SCID mice
(31). Immunofluorescent staining showed that tumor vessels
were positive for huCD31 and huALK1 (Supplementary
Fig. 3C). Systemic administration of Anti-huALK1 significantly and dose-dependently reduced huCD31þ microvessel
density (huMVD) compared with a nonspecific control IgG2
(Fig. 3C). Anti-huALK1 generated a similar huMVD reduction (40%–73%) compared with sunitinib (33%–58%) and
bevacizumab (40%–46%) across several studies (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that, similar to VEGF/VEGFRs, ALK1 may be a
factor promoting robust human angiogenesis.
ALK1 may contribute to resistance to anti-VEGF
treatments through dysregulation of vessel
normalization
Given the observed involvement of VEGF in ALK1 signaling,
we investigated whether tumors secreting a higher level of
VEGF are more sensitive to anti-ALK1 treatment. We chose
M24met/R xenograft tumors that had acquired resistance to
a VEGF RTK inhibitor (PF-00337210), because these tumors
express significantly higher huVEGF-A under PF-00337210
treatment, compared with untreated tumors (Fig. 4A, i).
The vasculature of the M24met/R tumors was found to be
ALK1þ/CD31þ/desminþ (Fig. 4A, ii–iv; desmin is a marker for
PCs) and appeared smooth, reminiscent of the so-called
"normalized vessels" (33–35). Anti-muALK1 plus PF-

00337210 generated a statistically significant TGI (57%) compared with PF-00337210 alone (Fig. 4A, v). In a separate study,
Anti-muALK1 alone did not generate any antitumor efficacy
(data not shown). Thus, VEGF RTK inhibitor treatment
resulted in increased VEGF that may be required for ALK1mediated angiogenesis. Enhanced efficacy of Anti-muALK1
combined with PF-00337210 was associated with further
reduction of CD31þ vessels in the tumor than PF-00337210
alone (Supplementary Fig. 4A); furthermore, the remaining
vessels in this group showed diminished CD31þ/desminþ
costaining and increased sprouting (Fig. 4A, vi and vii).
Next we investigated whether huALK1 inhibition can also
enhance the TGI of bevacizumab, using Anti-huALK1 in the
chimera tumor model. Bevacizumab produced moderate
(42%) TGI (Fig. 4B), despite its ability to significantly inhibit
huMVD and muMVD (Fig. 4C). Serum samples from the
chimera tumor mice contained significantly higher
huVEGF-A than muVEGF-A (Supplementary Fig. 4B); thus,
the lack of robust TGI by bevacizumab in this model could not
be fully explained by its lack of cross-reactivity to muVEGF-A.
An alternative explanation may be that tumors in this model
have intrinsic resistance to bevacizumab. We questioned
whether ALK1 played a role in this resistance. As expected,
Anti-huALK1 alone showed little TGI (11%), due to its lack of
cross-reactivity to muALK1 (and murine angiogenesis played
a significant role in tumor growth). When Anti-huALK1 was
combined with bevacizumab, significant TGI was observed
(58% compared with control, P < 0.05; Fig. 4B), implying that
huALK1 in human vessels was at least partially responsible for
bevacizumab resistance in this model.
The above combination treatment did not further reduce
huMVD (Fig. 4C), yet markedly improved efficacy. To understand why, we conducted in-depth immunohistochemistry
(IHC) analysis of the vessels. Tumors treated with AntihuALK1 were often left with large, open structures consisting
of desminþ PCs but lacked huCD31, as if Anti-huALK1
"pulled" human ECs out of the vasculature that was once
covered with PCs prior to Anti-huALK1 treatment (Fig. 4D, i–
iv, arrowheads). In the same tumor, the remaining smaller
vessels were huCD31þ/desmin (indicated by §), suggesting
that Anti-huALK1 prevented the recruitment of PCs to these
vessels. The above observation/interpretation is consistent
with the vascular characteristics of ALK1/ mice (3–5).

Figure 3. Anti-muALK1 inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth in mice. A, PAF-enriched AngioReactors were implanted in mice and murine angiogenesis
was assessed 10 days later (n ¼ 6–8 per group). Anti-muALK1, Amu-VEGF, or A1D16 (a nonspecific mouse IgG1 control) was administered either systemically
(4 days postimplant) or premixed in the devices (30 mg/mL each). *, P < 0.001 versus either of the control groups. Results were reproducible in two other
experiments. B, Anti-muALK1 inhibited the growth of mammary fat pad–implanted MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in mice (n ¼ 2 studies). Top left, colocalization (yellow) of muALK1 (red) with muCD31 (green) in the tumor vasculature. Bottom left, Anti-muALK1 [QW and twice weekly (BIW)] and Amu-VEGF

Anti-ALK1 in Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth

(n ¼ 4–5 per group).

Conversely, bevacizumab treatment resulted in large, open
vessels positive for both huCD31 and desmin (Fig. 4D, v–viii),
mimicking a stable/normalized vascular phenotype. AntihuALK1 plus bevacizumab resulted in vascular structures
that were largely either huCD31þ or desminþ (Fig. 4D, ix–
xii). Overall, combination treatment reduced huMVD, vessel
sprouting, and tortuosity compared with the control group
(Fig. 4D, xiii–xvi). These data suggest that anti-ALK1 quantitatively disrupted the vascular normalization phenotype
induced by bevacizumab, which may have contributed to
the observed combinatorial antitumor efficacy.

ALK1 supports functional blood flow of large vessels
Because vascular normalization may result in better blood
flow (BF; refs. 36, 37), we investigated whether Anti-huALK1
could modulate BF in the chimera tumor model using CE-US
that can differentiate flow rates within the microvasculature
(32). Sixty hours after Anti-huALK1 administration, the development of vessels with fast flow rates was significantly inhibited compared with control tumors (Fig. 5A, arrowheads).
Quantification of CE-US imaging parameters further revealed
that the prevalence of fast BF (generally associated with large/
arterial and functional vessels), but not slow BF (associated

Discussion

tumors, addition of Anti-muALK1 generated statistically
significant antitumor efficacy (Fig. 4A, v). TGFb signaling
has been shown to interact closely with several other
pathways in a context-dependent fashion in models of
development and pathologic diseases (reviewed in ref.
39). The molecular mechanism of the cross-talk between
TGFb/ALK1 and VEGF/bFGF pathways in angiogenesis is
being investigated.
Through antitumor efficacy, functional imaging, and IHC
studies, we reveal that the mode of action of ALK1 in
angiogenesis may be different from, yet complementary
to, that of VEGF/VEGFRs. VEGF/VEGFRs are well known
to promote neovascularization with weak, leaky vessels
deficient in tight junction and EC–PC interaction. AntiVEGF therapy can result in vascular normalization (35, 36,
40). In supporting this, we reported that a VEGFR inhibitor
selectively decreased total tumor perfusion, but not BF, in
mature vessels (41). Although vascular normalization may
temporarily improve the delivery of an anticancer agent, it
has been associated with relapse and resistance to antiVEGF therapies in the clinic (40). ALK1 may be essential in
supporting the function of "normalized" vessels, as we show
that anti-ALK1 disrupted ALK1þ EC–PC co-localization,
reduced BF primarily in the large and fast-flow vessels,
and improved efficacy in models otherwise resistant to
anti-VEGF therapies. Collectively, our data support the
hypothesis that ALK1 expression and function following
anti-VEGF/VEGFR inhibitor therapy may contribute to
vascular adaptation from the VEGF-driven neovascularization to the ALK1-driven productive angiogenesis involving
mature vessels. The proposed mode of action of ALK1 may
also explain the controversy regarding the role of ALK1
in angiogenesis (11–16). Taken together, our findings suggest a key differentiation between, and yet complementary
role of, ALK1 and VEGF/VEGFRs in promoting tumor
angiogenesis.

Here we report that ALK1 signaling and function in
ECs may depend on multiple PAFs including VEGF and
bFGF, and that ALK1 may significantly contribute to
blood and lymphatic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and
resistance to therapies involving anti-VEGF or VEGF RTK
inhibitors.
We showed that ALK1-mediated signaling, EC phenotypical changes, and differentiation were not only dependent on its natural ligand TGFb, but also on VEGF and
bFGF. TGFb-stimulated Smads phosphorylation and Id-1
expression, until now thought to be specific to ALK1, were
also inhibited by sunitinib, an inhibitor of VEGFRs and
several other RTKs (38). Because VEGF and bFGF are not
known to bind to ALK1, nor is TGFb direct binding to
VEGFRs expected, one possible explanation for our observations may be that there is intracellular cross-talk
between the VEGF/VEGFR, bFGF/FGF receptor, and
TGFb/ALK1 pathways at the pSmads level. Consistent with
in vitro observations, in vivo we observed that in mice
bearing PF-00337210-treated M24met/R tumors, which produced higher serum VEGF than untreated M24met/R

Translation to the clinic
Here we show that the ALK1 protein is broadly but
heterogeneously expressed in human tumor vasculature,
implying a need for patient selection in the clinic to achieve
meaningful benefit from anti-ALK1 therapy. Regarding
CECs, both the total and viable ALK1þ/CEC counts were
significantly increased in patients with cancer compared
with healthy volunteers. ALK1 expression in tumors on the
basis of TMAs was not always consistent with the percentage of viable ALK1þ/CECs; the latter may be a surrogate
marker for the fraction of vessel turnover and may not
directly correlate with ALK1 in the vasculature of solid
tumors. The discrepancy may also reflect differences in
disease stage and treatment history of patients associated
with TMAs (mostly treatment-naïve, early-stage cancers)
and CEC samples (all from advanced cancers). The significance of ALK1 positivity in CECs is being investigated.
Because Id-1, an ALK1 target gene, has been implicated
in the mobilization and function of endothelial progenitor
cells (42), we hypothesized that ALK1 may play a key role
in circulating EC mobilization and associated angio-

with small, leaky vessels), was suppressed in Anti-huALK1–
treated tumors compared with control tumors (Fig. 5B and C).
A similar conclusion could be drawn from a study using the
same model and power Doppler ultrasonography (Supplementary Fig. 5). These results suggest that huALK1 may be
involved in promoting efficient BF in functional and established vessels for human angiogenesis.
ALK1 expression in primary ECs and human tumor
specimens
To begin assessing the relevance of ALK1 in human cancer,
we investigated huALK1 expression by IHC in 3 tissue microarrays (TMA) containing more than 3,000 human tumor
specimens representing more than 100 tumor types. The
results showed that huALK1 was expressed primarily in the
vasculature of most human tumors with varying frequency
and intensity. The expression in tumor cells and normal
tissues was generally weak or absent. The top 20 most frequently occurring tumor types were rank ordered on the basis
of ALK1 expression score (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Table B).
Figure 6B shows representative photomicrographs from 3
tumor types and the corresponding normal tissues. These
data imply that ALK1 may be a potential therapeutic target in
certain tumor types.
ALK1 expression in CECs from human peripheral blood
(HPB) samples was also assessed. Greater levels of total
ALK1þ/CECs were detected in the HPB of patients with
cancer than that of healthy volunteers (Supplementary
Fig. 6; Supplementary Table C). The number of viable
ALK1þ/CECs was even more markedly increased in patients
with advanced colon cancer, melanoma, and non–small cell
lung cancer than in healthy volunteers (Fig. 6C). Implications of ALK1þ/CECs are being investigated in an ongoing
phase I study.

activity in order to ascertain their potential utility as predictive biomarkers.
In conclusion, our data suggest that VEGF/bFGF can regulate ALK1 signaling and angiogenesis in vivo, and ALK1 plays
an important and compensatory role in vascular angiogenesis.
