BACKGROUND: The YKL-40 coding chitinase 3-like 1 gene is 1 of the most overexpressed genes in human glioblastomas.
The objectives of this study were to explore YKL-40 protein expression status and World Health Organization (WHO) pathologic grades of primary human astrocytoma and to investigate the role of YKL-40 in the proliferation of both established
and primary astrocytoma cells in vitro. METHODS: WHO grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 primary astrocytomas (210 patients) were evaluated for YKL-40 protein expression status in immunohistochemical analyses. In addition, after transfection with a plasmid
that contained YKL-40 small-interfering RNA (siRNA), cell proliferation and the cell cycle were measured with a cell-viability
assay and flow cytometry. Expression levels of phosphorylated, total mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein
kinase B (AKT) were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The percentage of positive cells and the staining intensity
differed significantly between different pathologic tumor grades (P < .001). The YKL-40 immunoreactivity score increased
markedly with increased pathologic grade (F ¼ 18.89; P < .001). In the in vitro experiment, the cell cycle was arrested in G1
phase. An inhibitor of the p38 MAPK, SB203580, could partially abrogate the cell proliferation inhibition effect by siRNA
treatment. The expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and phosphorylated AKT were
notably decreased in siRNA-transfected U87 cells. In contrast, the expression levels of phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 and 2 increased significantly (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: YKL-40 expression status correlated
well with the pathologic grade of primary astrocytomas. The current results also indicted that YKL-40 plays a pivotal
role in glioma cell proliferation through activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways. YKL-40 may be an attractive tarC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most aggressive and malignant brain tumors with the worst clinical prognosis in
both adults and children. Despite advances in microsurgical techniques, combined with radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy, the quality of life and the life expectancy of patients with GBM has remained essentially unchanged over the last
several decades.1,2
Recently, several retrospective and prospective studies reported that an elevated serum concentration of YKL-40,
detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in patients with breast, colorectal, ovarian, kidney, prostate,
and small cell lung cancers and malignant melanoma was an independent prognostic variable indicating a short recurrence-free interval and short overall survival.3-8 In patients with gliomas, serum YKL-40 levels were correlated with tumor
grade and potentially with tumor burden and poor survival.9,10 Cox regression analysis confirmed that the serum YKL-40
level was a marker for survival independent of age or sex in patients with glioma.11 These results suggest that serum
YKL-40 levels may be a promising prognostic predictor for cancer patients.
At the same time, the biologic function of the YKL-40 in cancer progression has attracted great interest, particularly
from oncologists. YKL-40 was identified as a secreted glycoprotein in vitro in the human osteosarcoma cell line MG63

YKL-40 in Adult Primary Astrocytoma/Zhang et al

more than 10 years ago. In the past decade, many studies
demonstrated YKL-40 expression in various solid tumors,
including GBMs. Notably, microarray gene analyses have
confirmed the human YKL-40 coding chitinase 3-like 1
gene as 1 of the most overexpressed genes in GBMs, but it
was not expressed in normal brain.9,12 Furthermore,
higher YKL-40 expression in glioma tissue was associated
with significantly poor radiation response, a shorter time
to progression, and shorter overall survival. It is an independent predictor of survival, after adjusting for patient
age, performance status, and extent of tumor resection.13
In in vitro experiments, immortalized human astrocytes
stably transfected with YKL-40 exhibited changes in gene
expression similar to those observed in human tumors and
were radioresistant with increased invasive potential.14
Taken together, these findings suggested the potential oncogenic role of YKL-40 in gliomas.
Nonetheless, because the inhibition of p53 augments YKL-40 expression15 and its overexpression in
immortalized human astrocytes increases matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity,14 the precise function of YKL-40 in
contributing to the behavior and progression of gliomas
remains largely unknown. For these reasons, first, we evaluated the tumor cell YKL-40 status in World Health
Organization (WHO) grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 primary astrocytomas in 210 patients. Second, using a small-interfering
RNA (siRNA) to silence the YKL-40 gene, we performed
in vitro experiments to assess the role of YKL-40 in both
established and primary astrocytoma cell proliferation.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT) pathways were examined to determine the mechanism by which YKL-40 silencing inhibits
the proliferation of glioma cells.

ogy, Xijing Hospital. Histologic subtypes and pathologic
grades of tumors were defined according to WHO criteria
(2000), including 11 pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) (WHO
grade 1); 69 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs) (WHO grade 2),
including 33 fibrillary astrocytomas and 36 protoplasmic
astrocytomas; 62 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) (WHO
grade 3); and 68 GBMs (WHO grade 4). Specimens were
rereviewed by a neuropathologist (Prof. Qing Li) to
ensure that they fulfilled histologic criteria for astrocytoma using current WHO guidelines. This study was
approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of
Xijing Hospital.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed according to routine laboratory methods.16 Goat antihuman
YKL-40 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, Calif) was diluted to 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1.0% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). PBS with 1.0% BSA was used a negative control
for each section in place of the primary antibody solution.
Experiments were performed 3 times on different days
using the same protocol and time exposures.

Patient Characteristics
Two hundred ten gross totally or partially resected astrocytoma specimens from the Department of Neurosurgery,
Xijing Hospital that were obtained between January 2005
and December 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. The
patient population, as summarized in Table 1, was
defined according to age, sex, and tumor location. No
patients had received any previous therapy, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, before surgery. Tumors that
originated from other organs or tissues were not detected.
All specimens were obtained from the primary surgery.
The corresponding formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tumor blocks were provided by the Department of Pathol-

Quantification of Staining Results
The immunohistochemistry results were evaluated independently by 2 specialized neuropathologists (Fu-Cheng
Ma and Ying-Mei Wang) who were blinded to pathologic
diagnoses and clinical data for all patients. To measure the
percentage of YKL-40-positive expressing cells (the PP
value), in the most strongly stained area of the tumor,
1000 cells were observed in 5 to 10 adjacent high-powered
fields at 400 magnification. Protein expression of
YKL-40 was assessed semiquantitatively to calculate the
YKL-40 immunoreactivity score by multiplying the PP
values (0, <10%; 1, 11%-25%; 2, 26%-50%; 3, 51%-

values (0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, strong staining).17 Because of the heterogeneous SI
of tumor cells, the SI was determined according to the SI
of most cells.
Cell Lines and Cell Culture
The cell lines that we used in this study were human gliomas U373, U87, A172, and T98cells; human astrocyte
cells; and human primary astrocytoma cells. The established tumor cell lines were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, Va), and
the astrocyte cell line was obtained from Cambrex BioScience (Walkersville, Md). All tumor cell lines were
maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM)
(Gibco Life Science, Gaithersburg, Md) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamate,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 lg/mL streptomycin (all
from Gibco Life Science). The human astrocyte cell line
was maintained in astrocyte basal medium (AGMTM)
supplemented with AGMTM SingleQuots (both from
Cambrex BioScience). Human primary astrocytoma cultures were established from fresh, surgically excised astrocytomas under the guidance of a neuronavigation system.
For tumor cell isolation, fresh, non-necrotic surgical
specimens were washed in PBS and mechanically disaggregated into small pieces, which were distributed evenly
in a cell culture flask coated with AmnioMax medium
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). After tumor cell outgrowth,
tumor pieces were removed, and cells were covered with
supplemented AmnioMax medium. Detailed information
on the patients with astrocytoma is provided in Table 2.
All cells were cultured at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Cell Transfection and siRNA
Cells were seeded at concentrations between 2.5  104
cells/mL and 5  104 cells/mL and were cultured for 24
hours in 6-well plates to reach 60% to 70% confluence
before transfection. Cells were transfected with 20 nM

SMARTpool reagents YKL-40 or nontargeting (random)
siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, Colo) in the presence of
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell Viability Assay
Cell proliferation was determined using a WST-1 cell proliferation reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany), as described previously.18 The p38 inhibitor
SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif) was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, St Louis, Mo) to a stock
concentration of 1 mM and diluted with culture medium
to a final concentration of 20 lM just before use. The
astrocytoma cell groups, the siRNA group, and the siRNA
plus SB203580 group were cultured for 24 hours,
48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours, respectively. Each
group set 8 wells. At each time point, cells were added
with 10 lL per well of WST-1 reagent cultured at 37 C
for 4 hours. The optical density value was measured at
460 nm wavelength using the Bio-Rad Benchmark
Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif). All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry
The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry of permeabilized cells stained with propidium iodide (Sigma Chemical Company) to determine the DNA content, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA content was
analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer equipped with a
FACStation running Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif). All experiments were performed in
triplicate and yielded similar results.
Real-Time Quantitative Reverse
Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Total RNA was extracted with Isogen (Nippon Gene,
Toyama, Japan), as described by the manufacturer. Combinational DNA (cDNA) was generated with the Firststrand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Biosciences,

Piscataway, NJ), as described by the manufacturer. Total
RNA (1 lg) was used for each reaction with polyT
primers. All real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) fragments were
amplified using the AmpliTaqGold System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 C for 10 minutes;
amplification for 45 cycles at 95 C for 30 seconds; a 1-minute annealing step at 60 C; a 1-minute elongation step
at 72 C; and a final, 10-minute elongation step at 72 C.
A control reaction with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (sense, 50 -AAC GGA TTT GGT
CGT ATT GGG C-30 antisense, 50 -TAA GCA GTT
GGT GGT GCA GG-30 ) was conducted to verify the
quality of the cDNA before the PCR with primers for
human YKL-40 (sense, 50 -CCT GST CAGE CBC ARC
ACT GT-30 antisense, 50 -GCT TTT GAC GST TTC
CTG GTC-30 ).
ELISA for YKL-40 in Culture Medium
The amount of YKL-40 protein secreted by the cells
was measured by collecting samples in medium and
subjecting them to a 2-site sandwich-type ELISA
(Quidel Corporation, San Diego, Calif), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Each time point was
analyzed in triplicate. No detectable YKL-40 was
identified in MEM or AGMTM that contained 10%
FBS. Protein concentrations were determined according to optical density values, which were measured at
405 nm wavelength using the Bio-Rad Benchmark
Microplate Reader.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analyses were performed as described in a
previous report19 with a primary antibody against YKL40 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn), b-actin, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
(phospho-ERK1/2), ERK1/2; phospho-AKT, AKT,
phospho-p38, p38, phosphorylated c-jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (phospho-JNK1/2), and JNK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass). These were followed
by incubation for 1 hour at room temperature with a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirat or antirabbit immunoglobulin G; Cell Signaling
Technology). Immunoreactive bands were observed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and were
quantified with an LAS-1000 plus Gel Documentation
System (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software package (version 13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). For
immunohistochemistry, the YKL-40 immunoreactivity
score for each group was expressed as the mean  standard
deviation. Differences in the YKL-40 immunoreactivity
score between different pathologic grade groups were
compared first using an analysis of variance and then by
using the Student-Newman-Keuls test for further comparison of differences between 2 groups. The exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the median of
PP value and the median SI among pathologic grades. For
cell viability, real-time quantitative RT-PCR, ELISAs,
and Western blot analyses, statistical significance between
>2 groups was tested using a 1-way analysis of variance;
statistical significance between 2 groups was tested using
the Student t test. A P value >.05 was considered
significant.

RESULTS
YKL-40 Immunohistochemistry Distinguishes
WHO Grade 1 Through 4 Astrocytomas
Few publications have demonstrated previously that
YKL-40 could facilitate the classification of gliomas. In
the current study, compared with glial fibrillary acidic
protein,20 YKL-40 immunohistochemistry in tumor tissues not only provided a better class distinction between
GBMs and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas but also reliably distinguished between grade 2 and 3 oligodendrogliomas and grade 2, 3, and 4 astrocytomas.21 However,
the literature to date lacks crucial documentation of
YKL-40 expression with respect to tumor grade within
a single glioma lineage, which would clarify the role of
YKL-40 in the progression of gliomas.20 Therefore, we
performed a retrospective examination of tumor tissues
by immunochemical staining. In total, 210 WHO grade
1 through 4 primary astrocytomas were identified that
over expressed YKL-40 protein. Positive staining was
observed mainly in the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Fig. 1)
in a grade-dependent manner: 66.1% of WHO grade 4
GBMs and 43.6% of WHO grade 3 AAs were positive
for YKL-40 in 25% of tumor cells. In contrast,
81.8% of WHO grade 1 PAs and 56.5% of WHO
grade 2 DAs were positive for YKL-40 in <10% of tumor cells (Table 3). An even greater difference was
observed in tumor cell SI: 80.9% of GBMs and 75.8%
of AAs had strong SI (rated 2 or 3), whereas 90.9% of
PAs and 72.4% of DAs either did not stain at all

To determine whether YKL-40 immunohistochemistry could be used to distinguish between pathologic
grades of astrocytoma, we conducted statistical analyses
on the semiquantitatively scored data. The PP values and
the SI differed significantly between pathologic grades (P
< .001). Furthermore, YKL-40 immunoreactivity scores
increased markedly with increase in pathologic grade (F ¼
18.89; P < .001 (Table 3). There were significant differences in YKL-40 immunoreactivity scores between the
grade 1 group and the grade 3 group (P ¼ .005) and
between the grade 2 group and the grade 4 group (P <
.001).
SiRNA YKL-40 Attenuates Astrocytoma
Cells Growth In Vitro
Unscheduled proliferation is 1 of the most pronounced
characteristics during the progression of astrocytomas. On
the basis of the relation between YKL-40 status and
WHO tumor grade, we hypothesized that YKL-40 might
play a crucial role in glioma cell proliferation. To address
this issue, first, we assessed YKL-40 messenger RNA
(mRNA) transcript and protein expression in 4 established glioma cell lines (U373, U87, A172, and T98) and
in normal human astrocytes (Ast). To certify the general
application, we further performed primary cell culture

from 5 cases of fresh surgical astrocytoma specimens
(Cases 1-5). Expression levels of YKL-40 mRNA transcript and protein also were measured. According to the
real-time, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, YKL-40 mRNA and protein were present in all 4
established cell lines and in all 5 clinical specimens.
Among them, U87 cells, Case 2 cells, and Case 5 cells
expressed the highest level of YKL-40; in contrast, normal
human astrocytes expressed neither YKL-40 mRNA nor
protein (Fig. 2a-d). In conditioned medium, U87 cells
had measurable amounts of YKL-40 protein, consistent
with a previous study.15 Tumor cells from Case 2 and
Case 5 secreted the highest amount of YKL-40 protein in
conditioned medium. Therefore, U87 cells and primary
tumor cells from Cases 2 and 5 were chosen for further
experiments, in which we specifically silenced the YKL-40
gene using siRNA. The effect of siRNA was confirmed by
real-time, quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3a,b), Western blot
analysis (Fig. 3c,d), and ELISA (Fig. 3e,f).
We used the WST-1 cell-viability assay to assess
the role of YKL-40 in the proliferation of astrocytoma
cells. U87 cells, negative control siRNA-transfected U87
cells (U87-Co), and YKL-40 siRNA-transfected U87 cells
(U87-Si) cells were cultured for 24 hours, 48 hours,
72 hours, and 96 hours, respectively. The results revealed
that the proliferation of U87-Si cells was suppressed significantly at 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours compared
with the other 2 groups (P < .01) (Fig. 4a). Similar results

were obtained in YKL-40 siRNA-transfected Si 2 and
Si 5 primary cells (Fig. 4b). We also analyzed the cell
cycle progression 48 hours after YKL-40 gene silencing.
Table 4 summarizes those results and indicates that the cell
cycle in 87% of U87-Si cells was arrested in G1 phase compared with 73% of U87 cells and 74% of U87-Co cells.
Therefore, silencing the YKL-40 gene attenuated U87 cell
proliferation by arresting the cell cycle in G1 phase.
In addition, we measured the activation of members
of the MAPK intracellular signaling pathway and AKT by
Western blot analysis. The expression of phospho-ERK1/
2 and phospho-AKT was decreased notably in the U87-Si
group (P < .01), whereas the expression of the other
2 members of the MAPK family, phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK1/2, was increased significantly (P < .01) (Fig.
5a-d). It is noteworthy that, when the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 was added to siRNA-transfected astrocytoma cells, as indicated by the WST-1 results, the
inhibitory effect of YKL-40 siRNA on tumor cell proliferation was partially abrogated (Fig. 4a,b).

DISCUSSION
In recent years, gene therapy for gliomas has developed
rapidly, and the targets include epidermal growth factor
receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and p53.
However, an ideal target for antiglioma therapy would be

a corresponding biomarker. In this sense, YKL-40 is different from other known glioma targets. On the basis of
previous reports, the serum level of YKL-40 is an independent prognostic factor in patients with glioma. In
addition, YKL-40 is over expressed in glioma tissues but is
not expressed in normal brain or normal human astrocytes, suggesting that YKL-40 is related to glioma initiation and progression.
Consistently, using the same immunohistochemical
methods, a previous report indicated that 54% of GBMs
were positive for YKL-40 staining in 25% of tumor cells
and that 84% of GBMs had strong staining (SI, 2 or 3).20
Another study that used Western blot analysis detected
dramatically elevated YKL-40 protein levels in 50% of
GBMs.9 In low-grade gliomas, the proportion of YKL40–positive tumor cells was comparatively small. In the
current study, no WHO grade 1 PAs and only 18.6% of
WHO grade 2 DAs were positive for YKL-40 in >25%
of tumor cells. More important, in this study, we demonstrated for the first time that YKL-40 protein expression
increased significantly with increasing WHO tumor grade,
suggesting that YKL-40 protein could be used to identify
the pathologic grade of primary astrocytomas, which is the
major cell lineage that accounts for most human gliomas.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal a
role for YKL-40 in human cancer cells as a proliferation

and cells from Cases 2 and 5 were transfected with siRNA directed against YKL-40, as described in the text (see Materials and
Methods). The down-regulation of YKL-40 expression was measured (a,b) at the RNA level by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis (c,d) at the protein level by Western blot analysis, and (e,f) in the medium of the cells with an

factor that activates MAPK pathways. These findings support the observations in normal human cells in vitro. One
study indicated that purified YKL-40 protein increased
cell proliferation by activating the MAPK pathway in normal human connective tissue cells. In addition, YKL-40
initiated MAPK signaling cascades in fibroblasts, leading
to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2.22 In another study,
the stimulation of human articular chondrocytes or skin
fibroblasts with interleukin 1 or tumor necrosis factor
alpha in the presence of YKL-40 protein reduced the
phosphorylation of both p38 and JNK1/2.23
Among the 3 members of MAPK family, the ERK
pathway has been studied thoroughly and is synonymous
with cell proliferation. ERK1/2 was up-regulated in

2694

human tumors. In gliomas, high tumor levels of phosphoERK1/2 were associated with a shorter survival and a
higher proliferation index.24 Elevated phospho-ERK1/2
levels during the late stages of tumor development suggests a role in glioma cell proliferation. It is noteworthy
that YKL-40 expression had a positive association with
the expression of phospho-ERK1/2, which is strongly correlated with a poor response to radiotherapy and a negative clinical outcome.25 Therefore, YKL-40 silencing may
decrease the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. We detected an
obvious decrease in phospho-ERK1/2 in U87-Si cells
accompanied by reduced proliferation, as expected.
Conversely, the role of p38 and JNK1/2 in human
cancers is complex, consistent with the various cellular

current study, YKL-40 silencing distinctly inhibited astrocytoma cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle in G1
phase and increasing the expression of phospho-p38. In
addition, a specific inhibitor of p38 significantly abrogated the cell proliferation inhibition effect in YKL-40silencing astrocytoma cells, reflecting involvement of the
p38 MAPK pathway in the proliferation function of
YKL-40 in astrocytoma cells. Moreover, a review of the
literature revealed that p38 and JNK may have a tumor
suppressive function that may be linked to their ability to

promote apoptosis.27 Meanwhile, YKL-40 activates the
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signaling pathways and
phosphorylation of AKT, which are associated with cell
survival in human connective tissue cells,22,23,28 suggesting an antiapoptotic role of this protein. Simultaneously,
our experiment demonstrated that phospho-AKT expression was decreased markedly after YKL-40 silencing. Thus,
the increase in phosphorylation of p38 and JNK1/2 in
U87-Si cells suggests the activation of apoptosis, which also
would reduce cell numbers after YKL-40 gene silencing.
Finally, our findings demonstrate for the first time
that YKL-40 expression correlates with the pathologic
grade of astrocytomas and acts as a proliferation marker
and an antiapoptosis factor in astrocytoma cells through
activation of the MAPK and AKT pathway. However, it
will be imperative to gain more information about its
mechanisms of action to move forward with the use of
YKL-40 as a potential target for glioma therapy. YKL-40
may become an attractive target for selective anticancer
drug development. Hopefully, exploring approaches or
drugs that may inhibit the expression of YKL-40 or abolish its function as a proliferation stimulator or antiapoptotic agent could improve the effect of conventional
therapies, thereby improving the survival and prognosis
of patients with glioma who have tumors that express
YKL-40.
