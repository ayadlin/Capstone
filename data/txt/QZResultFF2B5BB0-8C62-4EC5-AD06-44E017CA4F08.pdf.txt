The oncofusion protein FUS–ERG targets key hematopoietic
regulators and modulates the all-trans retinoic acid signaling
pathway in t(16;21) acute myeloid leukemia
AM Sotoca, KHM Prange, B Reijnders, A Mandoli, LN Nguyen, HG Stunnenberg and JHA Martens
The ETS transcription factor ERG has been implicated as a major regulator of both normal and aberrant hematopoiesis. In acute
myeloid leukemias harboring t(16;21), ERG function is deregulated due to a fusion with FUS/TLS resulting in the expression of a
FUS–ERG oncofusion protein. How this oncofusion protein deregulates the normal ERG transcription program is unclear. Here, we
show that FUS–ERG acts in the context of a heptad of proteins (ERG, FLI1, GATA2, LYL1, LMO2, RUNX1 and TAL1) central to proper
expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell hematopoietic phenotype. Moreover, in t(16;21) FUS–ERG co-occupies
genomic regions bound by the nuclear receptor heterodimer RXR:RARA inhibiting target gene expression and interfering with
hematopoietic differentiation. All-trans retinoic acid treatment of t(16;21) cells as well as FUS–ERG knockdown alleviate the
myeloid-differentiation block. Together, the results suggest that FUS–ERG acts as a transcriptional repressor of the retinoic acid
signaling pathway.

INTRODUCTION
Members of the large E-twenty-six-speciﬁc (ETS) protein family are
winged helix–turn–helix DNA-binding domain transcription
factors that have diverse functions and activities in physiology
and oncogenesis, among which normal and aberrant hematopoiesis.1
ERG (V-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog),
a hallmark ETS factor protein, is known to have a critical role in
establishing deﬁnitive hematopoiesis and is required for normal
megakaryopoiesis. Truncated forms of ERG due to oncogenic
fusion translocations have been associated with multiple cancers
such as Ewing's sarcoma (EWS–ERG), prostate cancer (TMPRSS2–
ERG) and acute myeloid leukemia (FUS–ERG; ELF3–ERG).2–4
The FUS–ERG chimeric oncogene has been associated with
acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) carrying the non-random t(16;21)
(p11;q22) chromosomal aberration. The resulting fusion protein
retains the N-terminal domain of FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/
translocated in liposarcoma) protein, and the C-terminal domain is
replaced by the ETS motif-DNA-binding domain of ERG.5 In vitro
experiments suggest that the FUS/TLS fusion domain (TFD)
regulates the DNA-binding activity of the FUS–ERG chimeric
protein, which as a result shows weaker transcriptional activation
properties compared with normal ERG proteins.6 However,
whether this mechanism also works in vivo is still unclear.
The normal FUS gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that
serves in transcription regulation and RNA metabolism.7 Both the
amino- and the carboxy-terminal regions of FUS/TLS containing
the conserved RNA-binding motifs are needed for poly(G)-speciﬁc
RNA-binding activity. In addition, analysis of TLS–ERG mutants
showed that the ﬁrst 173 amino acids of the FUS/TLS N terminus
comprise a subdomain that mediates interaction with RNAPII,8,9
suggesting a direct role in transcriptional regulation and/or

transcription-coupled RNA processing. A role in transcription
regulation was further suggested by the ﬁnding that the
N-terminal part of FUS binds retinoid-x receptor (RXR).10–12 Finally,
it has been shown that the C terminus of FUS inhibits DNA binding
and transcription activation of SPI1 (PU.1).13,14
FUS expression is downregulated in the early stages of ATRAinduced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 leukemic cells.15,16
Furthermore, a knockout study showed that Fus null mice have an
increased number of granulocytes.17 Another study with Fusdeﬁcient mice showed that Fus− / − fetal livers developed normally,
except for a mild reduction in numbers of hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells compared with wild type (WT).18 These ﬁndings
suggest a role for FUS in regulating hematopoietic stem cell selfrenewal and terminal differentiation along the myeloid lineage.19
ERG has also been associated with aberrant hematopoiesis.
High expression of ERG is linked with poor prognosis in a
subgroup of leukemia patients with AML and acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia.2,20,21 In addition, correct Erg gene dosage is
critical for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell function.
Mice homozygous for the loss-of-function ErgMld2 mutation die at
midgestation, with a profound defect in deﬁnitive hematopoiesis
suggesting an essential role in hematopoietic stem cell selfrenewal.22–25
Still, how FUS–ERG fusion protein may lead to cellular
abnormalities by deregulating normal ERG gene transcription
in vivo is not understood. Therefore, in the present study we used
massive parallel sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitates
(chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq)) and
quantitative sequencing of transcripts (RNA-seq) for identiﬁcation
of FUS–ERG-binding sites in t(16;21) AML cells. We found that
FUS–ERG mainly binds non-promoter regions in a complex

consisting of other ETS factors, GATA2, LMO2, LYL1, RUNX1, TAL1
and RNAPII. Interestingly, we noticed that apart from interacting
with RXR, FUS–ERG also colocalizes to similar regions as the
nuclear receptor RARA. Treatment with ATRA resulted in reduced
FUS–ERG binding and higher expression of target genes,
suggesting that the role of FUS–ERG in leukemogenesis relates
to repressing the ATRA signaling pathway.
RESULTS
FUS–ERG expression in leukemic cells
The reciprocal translocation t(16;21)(p11;q22) is a rare abnormality
associated with AML and present in the TSU-1621-MT and YHN-1
cells, a M4 and M1 AML type, respectively, according to the
French-American-British classiﬁcation. To validate gene expression
arising from the translocation, we examined expression of FUS–
ERG messenger RNA (mRNA) by reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT–
PCR). Using primers that recognize exon 6 from FUS and exon 10
from ERG26 (Figure 1a), we were able to conﬁrm the expression of
the oncofusion gene in the TSU-1621-MT and YNH-1 cells
(Figure 1b), whereas it is not expressed in KG-1 and U937 cells
that do not harbor this translocation.
To assess whether the fusion of ERG to FUS would affect WT ERG
or FUS, we extended the quantitative PCR (qPCR) and analyzed
the relative expression levels of the fusion gene as compared with
the WT. This analysis revealed that WT FUS (FUS4-5) levels are
comparable in all four cell types, whereas ERG levels are
comparable in TSU, YNH-1 and KG-1 cells, but not detectable in
U937. Western blot analysis using a C-terminal ERG antibody and a
N-terminal FUS antibody conﬁrmed the presence of high levels of
FUS, and expression of FUS–ERG and ERG proteins in the nucleus
of TSU-1621-MT cells (Figure 1c), whereas both FUS–ERG as well as
WT ERG are not present in the U937 cells, corroborating the
RT–qPCR results.
ERG-fusion-speciﬁc binding in cancer
The t(16;21) fusion results in aberrant expression of ERG in AML.
ERG is also involved in translocations underlying prostate cancer
(TMPRSS2–ERG) and Ewing's sarcoma (EWS–ERG).27 To examine
whether a common ERG cancer signature could be observed, we
used an ERG antibody (recognizing the C-terminal region) in ChIPseq experiments in the TSU-1621-MT leukemic cells and compared
the proﬁle with the ERG-binding proﬁles resulting from expression
of TMPRSS–ERG in VCaP (prostate cancer) and EWS–ERG in CADOES1 cells28,29 (Figure 1d). We used MACS230 at a P-value cutoff of
10−6 to identify all ERG-binding regions in TSU-1621-MT and EWS–
ERG in CADO-ES1 (Ewing’s sarcoma) cells and identiﬁed 31 596,
32 406 and 17 469 ERG-binding regions from TSU-1621-MT, VCaP
and CADO-ES1 cells, respectively. Between TSU-1621-MT and VCaP
cells, we identiﬁed a 35% overlap (11 116 binding sites), whereas
only an overlap of 1% (404 binding sites) was found between
EWS–ERG- and FUS–ERG-expressing cells. Intersection of the three
data sets revealed an overlap of 148 peaks, representing mainly
promoter regions associated with genes belonging to the
Jak-STAT signaling and Wnt signaling pathways (P-values 5E − 04
and 6E − 04, respectively; data not shown).
The low overlap between the different ERG proﬁles suggests
that ERG binds to different genomic loci depending on the cell
type. To examine whether the aberrant ERG expression in t(16;21)
AML would reﬂect ERG binding in other AML subtypes, we
compared ERG binding in TSU-1621-MT cells with those in SKNO-1
and ME-1 cells, two cell lines representative of the t(8;21) and inv
(16) translocation, respectively. Overlapping the binding regions
of the three leukemic cell lines revealed a large common set of
17 750 regions (Figure 1e). As these AML common regions
potentially represent key binding sites for ERG-induced leukemic
transformation, we performed functional analysis of the associated
Oncogene (2016) 1965 – 1976

genes. This revealed high enrichment scores (410) for genes
involved in regulation of the cell cycle (Figure 1f), suggesting the
involvement of ERG target genes in deregulation of normal cell
proliferation.
FUS–ERG targets ETS factor sites in promoter and enhancer
regions
To identify potential FUS–ERG-binding sites, we extended our
ChIP-seq analyses and included an antibody recognizing the N
terminus of the FUS protein. Using the same peak-calling settings
as above allowed the identiﬁcation of 16 533 FUS-occupied
regions in TSU-1621-MT cells. A total of 10 364 binding regions
were found that overlapped between FUS and ERG, for example,
at ITGAM and CSF3R promoter and enhancer regions, potentially
representing FUS–ERG-binding sites (Figures 2a and b). A subset of
these binding sites was validated through re-ChIP experiments on
targeted loci, conﬁrming that the two parts of the fusion protein
occupy the same genomic region (Supplementary Figure 1).
Moreover, transfecting a ﬂag-tagged FUS–ERG followed by
ChIP–qPCR in U937 cells, which do not express the fusion,
showed binding at target sites identiﬁed in TSU-1621-MT cells
(Supplementary Figure 2), conﬁrming that the fusion protein can
bind to these DNA regions.
To investigate whether WT FUS might colocalize with ERG, we
extended our ChIP-seq analysis and examined binding of FUS
at ERG-occupied regions in the SKNO-1 and ME-1 cells
(Supplementary Figure 3). This analysis revealed enrichments of
the FUS signal at ERG-binding sites in these two AML cell types,
suggesting that WT FUS might also colocalize with ERG in other
AMLs. Together these results suggest that in TSU-1621-MT cells
due to the fusion of FUS and ERG, the interaction of these two
proteins is stabilized.
The putative FUS–ERG-occupied regions in TSU-1621-MT cells
are predominantly located in non-promoter, mostly intergenic
regions (Figure 2c), whereas ERG peaks not overlapping with FUS
(and likely representing WT ERG binding) show a higher
percentage localized to promoter regions. Motif analysis of the
FUS–ERG-binding sites revealed that the ETS factor core motif
GGAAG was enriched in nearly all of the binding sites (Figure 2d).
In addition to the ETS motif, the RUNX1 motif was also found to be
enriched in FUS–ERG-binding sites, suggesting FUS–ERG is
involved in aberrant regulation of RUNX1 target genes. Motif
analysis of the 6169 FUS-only peaks surprisingly also revealed
enrichment/presence of the ETS transcription factor motif. It was
previously suggested that WT FUS binding to DNA could be
mediated by interaction with SPI1.13,14 Indeed, including a SPI1
ChIP-seq in our analysis revealed SPI1 enrichment at all FUS-onlybinding sites (Supplementary Figure 4), suggesting that non-fused
FUS recruitment to DNA might in part be ETS factor dependent.
FUS has been suggested to multimerize through its N-terminal
domain,31 suggesting that this property might also be present in
the FUS–ERG fusion protein. Such oligomerization could be
strengthened by the presence of multiple binding motifs for
ERG. To inspect whether multiple ETS motifs are present in FUS–
ERG-binding sites, we examined the number of motifs present
within one peak (Figure 2e). In addition, we examined the number
of RUNX1 motifs. This revealed that within one FUS–ERG-occupied
region, generally one RUNX1 but multiple ETS motifs can be
detected, suggesting that FUS–ERG may act in an oligomeric
complex, as has previously been suggested for other oncofusion
proteins,32 and/or that FUS–ERG collaborates with other ETS
factors.
To examine which other ETS factors might be involved in
regulating ETS motif-containing binding sites, we performed
a DNA pull-down experiment using a speciﬁc nucleotide
sequence that contains the ETS consensus motif 5ʹ-CCGGAAG-3ʹ
(ETS bait) and a control sequence (Control bait) with a scrambled

spectrometry33 (see Supplementary Materials and methods). As
expected, speciﬁcally ETS family members of the I, IIa, IIb and IV
classes, but not SPI1, were enriched in the ETS motif pull-down
(Figure 2g). Unfortunately, peptides recognizing the N terminus of
FUS (present in WT FUS and in FUS–ERG) were not found, likely due
to the inability of trypsin to digest the FUS glycine-rich regions.
Interestingly, the ratio of Control vs ETS pull-down peptides was
higher for FUS C-terminal peptides, representing WT FUS, suggesting WT FUS is underrepresented at genomic regions harboring ETS
consensus sequences. As our ChIP-seq results using an N-terminal
antibody indicate enrichment of FUS at ETS-containing-binding
sites, this signal is likely due to the fusion of FUS and ERG.
To conﬁrm the interactions of FLI1 with the ETS-motif-containing
DNA fragment, we used an antibody recognizing FLI1 in western
analysis after pull-down, as well as in ChIP-seq. This revealed speciﬁc
FLI1 binding to the ETS-containing DNA fragment (Figure 2f), as well
as increased occupancy of FLI1 at FUS–ERG-binding sites (Figure 2h),
corroborating the pull-down results.
FUS–ERG does not interfere with assembly of a hematopoietic
transcription factor complex
Both ERG and FLI1 have been suggested to function in a heptad of
proteins,34–36 which is central to proper expression of genes

involved in maintaining a stem cell hematopoietic phenotype.
RNA-seq analysis using TSU-1621-MT cells revealed that all these
seven heptad transcription factors (GATA2/FLI1/RUNX1/TAL1/
LYL1/LMO2/ERG) are expressed in this cell type, suggesting that
also in the context of FUS–ERG the heptad can potentially
assemble. To examine whether the heptad is present or whether
assembly of the heptad is interfered due to the FUS–ERG fusion,
we performed ChIP-seq for all the heptad factors in TSU-1621-MT
cells (Figure 3a). Analyzing the binding data revealed that in
TSU-1621-MT cells heptad complexes were present, and that the
majority of the heptad-binding sites were occupied by FUS–ERG,
suggesting that the FUS moiety does not interfere with TF
complex assembly (Figure 3b). We further characterized the
distribution of binding events across FUS–ERG/heptad-occupied
genomic features and identiﬁed four clusters that could be
distinguished on different levels of FLI1, GATA2 and LYL1. Clusters
2 and 3 represent intergenic regions with relatively low FLI1 levels,
and are functionally enriched for abnormal hematopoiesis,
apoptosis signaling and myeloid cell differentiation. Cluster 4
represents promoter regions with higher levels of FLI1 and LYL1
and is functionally enriched for cell proliferation, myeloid
differentiation and immune response. In contrast, cluster 1, which
is linked to promoter regions, is enriched for transcriptional
coupled events and represents regions strongly bound by ERG,

FLI1, RUNX1 and TAL1. Together these results suggest that
FUS–ERG does not interfere with heptad formation, but that
depending on the genomic context, occupancy strength of
heptad components can vary.
Next, we compared the heptad occupancy in the TSU-1621-MT
cells with available data from non-leukemic CD34+ cells,36 which
represent a normal hematopoietic cell population. We found
enrichment of heptad components in CD34+ cells at some of our
FUS–ERG-binding sites, for example, HHEX, LAPTM5 and CBFA2T3
genes were bound by all seven TFs in both cell types
(Supplementary Figures 5A and B). Together these results suggest
that the heptad distribution in TSU cells resembles only part of the
heptad signature in CD34+ cells.
FUS–ERG modulates the ATRA response
FUS/TLS has been reported to interact with RXR,10 and also our
mass spectrometry analysis revealed approximately twofold
enrichment of RXR (RXRβ) in the ETS-motif-containing DNA pulldown (Figure 2g). To examine whether FUS–ERG binds similar
genomic regions as RXR, we performed ChIP-seq using an RXR
antibody (recognizing RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ). This analysis
revealed enrichment of RXR at high-conﬁdence FUS–ERG-binding
sites (Figures 4a and b), although at varying strength. As RXR is
acting in heterodimeric complexes, we wondered whether
another nuclear receptor could be present interacting with RXR.
We found a variety of other nuclear receptors expressed in normal
TSU-1621-MT cells, of which RARA was one of the highest nuclear
receptors expressed known to form a heterodimer with RXR
(Figure 4c). Moreover, as RARA is a common fusion partner in
acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLs),37 another subsets of AMLs,

we wondered whether RARA could be present in the FUS–ERG/
RXR complex.
To answer this question, we performed ChIP-seq using a RARA
antibody. Quantitation of RARA tag densities at FUS–ERG peaks
revealed enrichment of RARA at FUS–ERG-binding sites (Figures 4a
and b), suggesting that FUS–ERG might be involved in regulating
retinoic acid signaling in t(16;21) AMLs.
A variety of AML cells have been shown to be responsive to
ATRA treatment, in particular AMLs harboring a translocation
involving RARA. No studies so far have considered patients with
t(16;21) (p11;q22) translocations as possible candidates for retinoic
acid treatment. As our ﬁndings show that RARA:RXR might
function as a partner of FUS–ERG, we wondered whether these
AML cells would be responsive to ATRA treatment. Therefore,
TSU-1621-MT cells were exposed to different concentrations of
ATRA during 4 days. The rate of cell growth for the TSU-1621-MT
cells was calculated as 0.7 times/day. After 4 days, the number of
viable cells had increased 2.5-fold (Figure 5a). This slow increase of
cell number was halted by the presence of ATRA, as evidenced by
reduced viability (Figure 5a) and differentiation of the cells (5–8%
of the total living cells per day attached to the plate) into
granulocytes (Figure 5b).
In APL, ATRA treatment was shown to increase histone
acetylation levels at PML–RARA-binding sites. To examine whether
histone acetylation is changed at FUS–ERG-binding sites, we
performed ChIP-seq analysis using antibodies recognizing histone
H3K9K14 acetylation. After ATRA treatment, increased levels of H3
acetylation were observed at nearly all binding sites (Figure 5c),
suggesting a role for the fusion protein in maintaining a less-active
chromatin structure.
To examine which genes are differentially expressed upon ATRA
treatment, we exposed TSU-1621-MT cells for 24 h to 1 μM ATRA

and performed RNA-seq analysis. Gene expression levels from
control and treated cells were estimated by counting the number
of reads mapping to constitutive exons for each gene and
determining RPKM values (reads per kilobase of exon model per
million uniquely mapped reads).
Initial analysis of CD markers revealed signiﬁcant increased
RPKM values for the differentiation marker CD38 compared with
untreated cells (Figure 5d; Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Other
CD markers shown to be lower expressed after ATRA treatment
(log ratio o − 1) were the progenitor markers HLA-DR, CD34 and

CD44, whereas granulocytic markers such as CD13, CD15, CD11b,
CD18 and MPO were higher expressed. As also increased
expression of other granulocytic markers including HIC1, ASB2
and NCF1 was observed after treatment, these results suggest
differentiation of ATRA-treated TSU-1621-MT cells toward the
granulocyte lineage.

genes, we assigned FUS–ERG-binding sites to the closest gene and
analyzed gene expression. This revealed that FUS–ERG target
genes are expressed at different level with 11% of genes

FUS–ERG modulates ATRA signaling

1972
expressed at a high level (RPKM410), 59% moderately expressed
(1 oRPKM o10) and 30% low expressed (RPKM o 1) (Figure 5e,
red boxes). RT–qPCR of a selection of genes from each of these
three groups conﬁrmed their relative expression results in both
TSU1621-MT as well as YNH-1 cells (Supplementary Figure 6).
Upon ATRA treatment, we observed increased expression for a
majority of FUS–ERG target genes (68%; Figure 5e, blue boxes),
suggesting FUS–ERG functions as a transcriptional repressor of
genes that are part of the ATRA signaling pathway.
Our results identiﬁed FUS–ERG binding at the third intron of
SPI1 (Figure 4a), a key regulator of hematopoietic differentiation. It
is characterized by the presence of direct repeat motifs, which
represent canonical RARΑːRXR-binding sites (Supplementary
Figure 7A), as well as the consensus binding sequence for ETS
factors (such as ERG). This region has previously been associated
with repression of SPI1 transcription,38 which can in APLs be
relieved after treatment with ATRA.37 In line with the suggestion
that FUS–ERG functions as a repressor of transcription, also in
ATRA-treated TSU-1621-MT cells SPI1 expression is increased
(Supplementary Table 6). SPI1 and ERG are both members of the
ETS family of transcription factors. We wondered whether SPI1
could alter the FUS–ERG-repressed gene program through
increased binding activity at FUS–ERG target genes after ATRA
treatment. However, ChIP-seq results of SPI1 binding before
and after ATRA treatment of TSU-1621-MT cells revealed no
differences in binding-site occupancy at FUS–ERG-binding sites
(Supplementary Figure 7B). Still, using a threefold cutoff we
identiﬁed 1377 genomic regions were SPI1 binding is increased
(Figure 5f, left). As expected, these regions do not overlap with
FUS–ERG-binding sites and represent sites of no/low histone
acetylation, which is increased upon binding of SPI1 (Figure 5f,
right; Figure 5g). Interestingly, these regions are associated with
genes that, upon knockout in mice, are associated with
granulocyte abnormalities (Figure 5h), suggesting that activation
of these regions is required for normal granulopoiesis.
Together these results suggest that FUS–ERG acts as a repressor
of SPI1, preventing it from activating a granulocytic differentiation
program.
ATRA treatment induces a FUS–ERG/ERG switch at enhancer
regions
To examine the effect of ATRA treatment on FUS–ERG binding, we
performed ChIP-seq using FUS and ERG antibodies in ATRAtreated TSU cells. In addition, we included RNAPII occupancy after
treatment, allowing to validate alterations in transcriptional
activity. K-means clustering distinguished ﬁve groups of FUS–
ERG-binding sites (Figures 6a and b). Whereas clusters 1, 3 and 4
were characterized by increases in ERG and lowered FUS
occupancy, clusters 2 and 5 showed reduced FUS and ERG levels,
suggesting that FUS–ERG binding is lost and that at a subset of
regions (clusters 1, 3 and 4) ERG binding is gained. Interestingly,
sites where ERG occupancy is increased are mostly non-promoter
(~85%) (clusters 1, 3 and 4) and show increased levels of RNAPII,
suggesting these are enhancers activated upon ATRA treatment
(Figure 6b; Supplementary Figure 8). Functional analysis of these
three clusters revealed a clear enrichment of genes downregulated in AML1–ETO and PML–RARα leukemic translocations,
suggesting that these represent a set of regions commonly
targeted in different subtypes of AML. Additional comparison with
AML1–ETO and PML–RARα-binding regions, 2754 and 2721 peaks,
respectively,20,37 pointed out that indeed, 50–60% of regions
overlapped (Supplementary Table 7).
In contrast to clusters 1, 3 and 4, clusters 2 and 5, which
represent mostly promoter regions (~83%), showed enrichment
for mRNA metabolism, mRNA splicing, cell cycle check points and
gene expression. These two clusters show loss of RNAPII
Oncogene (2016) 1965 – 1976

occupancy upon ATRA treatment, likely representing a switch
from a poised RNAPII to a transcriptional active molecule.
FUS–ERG silencing results in cell death
To examine the molecular targeting of the FUS–ERG oncofusion
protein in TSU-1621-MT cells, we generated a small-hairpin RNA
(shRNA) construct targeting the fusion point sequence of FUS–ERG
under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (FH1t-UTG).
FUS–ERG-silenced TSU-1621-MT cells (Supplementary Figure 9)
resulted in cell death and decreased proliferation (Figure 7a),
suggesting FUS–ERG is needed to maintain the full leukemogenic
potential of these cells.
To examine the effect of FUS–ERG knockdown on target gene
expression, we performed RNA-seq analysis. We identiﬁed 1833
FUS–ERG target genes, such as CTNNB1 and IL1B (Supplementary
Figure 10) that were differentially expressed. Among these genes,
1149 were upregulated and 684 were downregulated by at least
twofold (Supplementary Table 8), suggesting FUS–ERG is involved
in gene repression, but can also activate particular gene sets. In
agreement with the knockdown-induced cell death, we found
increased expression of genes inducing apoptosis, such as CASP10,
ATM, SAMD3, BMF and FAF1, whereas anti-apoptotic genes such as
BCL-2, GADD45B, IL1B and IL2RA were downregulated.
Finally, we integrated the knockdown analysis with the ATRAinduced differentiation results to identify the key ATRA-responsive
genes regulated by FUS–ERG. A scatter plot (Figure 7b) showing
the log2 ratios of both the shRNA knockdown experiment (x axis;
induced/non-induced) and the ATRA-differentiation experiment
(y axis; ATRA treated/non-treated) revealed 138 FUS–ERG target
genes higher expressed after FUS–ERG knockdown or after ATRA
treatment. This set is enriched for genes involved in myeloid
differentiation (Figure 7b), suggesting FUS–ERG has a role in
repressing this particular gene set from becoming activated by
ATRA. In contrast, among the common 76 downregulated genes,
enrichment for immune response, anti-apoptosis and cytokine–
cytokine receptor interaction pathways were found.
Together our results suggest that FUS–ERG acts in part as a
transcriptional repressor of the retinoic acid signaling pathway for
a subset of target genes. It acts in the context of other master
hematopoietic transcription factors, as well as RARA:RXR to inhibit
genes that can drive myeloid differentiation. Both ATRA treatment
and FUS–ERG knockdown can alleviate this repression and induce
expression of this set of target genes (Figure 7c).
DISCUSSION
AMLs harboring t(16;21)(p11;q22) express the oncofusion protein
FUS–ERG. Expression of this fusion protein in normal human
myeloid progenitors has been shown to result in a block in
development at the promyelocytic stage,39 an arrest in erythroid
and myeloid differentiation and an increase in proliferation
and self-renewal capacity of human myeloid progenitors.39
However, these transduction experiments can only partially
recapitulate the disease state.40 In this study, we describe for
the ﬁrst time the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of
the FUS–ERG oncofusion in AML at a genome-wide level in
patient-derived cell line models. We found that this oncofusion is
expressed at similar levels as WT ERG, and might interfere with
normal ETS factor regulation. To identify FUS–ERG binding, we
used two antibodies speciﬁcally recognizing the N terminus of FUS
and the C terminus of ERG. We identiﬁed a set of 10 364 genomic
regions, mainly intergenic and thus representing putative
enhancer regions, to which FUS–ERG binds. We discovered that
the oncofusion protein occupies genomic regions bound by ERG,
RUNX1, FLI1, GATA2, LMO2, LYL1 and TAL1/SCL, which together
form a heptad of transcription factors associated with stem cell
programs and clinical outcome in AML, suggesting the expression

of FUS–ERG might interfere with the activity but not the assembly
of this heptad.
In addition, we identiﬁed binding of the nuclear receptor
heterodimer RARA:RXR to FUS–ERG-occupied genomic regions,
suggesting the oncofusion protein might be involved in
modulating the retinoic acid response. Treatment of t(16;21) cells

markers CD11b and CD38.41,42 Prolonged treatment with ATRA
resulted in apoptosis consistent with the onset of postdifferentiation cell death. Together these results suggest that
ATRA triggers differentiation and thereby stops self-renewal in
t(16;21) AML cells. Thus far, only APLs are unique among
leukemias due to their sensitivity to ATRA.43 However, our results
would suggest that also for t(16;21) AMLs ATRA treatment might
provide an entry point for eradicating leukemic cells.

for the suggested actions of FUS–ERG in t(16;21) cells before and after ATRA treatment. Before treatment, FUS–ERG binds as an oligomer to
promoter and intergenic regions together with a heptad of transcription factors, as well as RARA:RXR and RNAPII. After ATRA treatment,
FUS–ERG is lost from the complex allowing RNAPII to transcribe genes involved in myeloid differentiation.

Our genome-wide proﬁling revealed that upon ATRA treatment
FUS–ERG binding is lost at enhancers and promoters, correlating
with increased ERG binding at enhancers and loss of RNAPII
binding at promoters. RNAPII loss at promoters likely reﬂects
transcriptional initiation corroborating the RNA-seq analysis that
revealed increased transcription of a majority of FUS–ERG target
genes. Together these results suggest FUS–ERG might act as a
transcriptional repressor.
To further test this, we performed knockdown of FUS–ERG
in t(16;21) cells and could show that loss of the oncofusion
protein results in higher expression of a subset of 138 genes that
are also higher expressed after ATRA treatment. Interestingly,
functional analysis of this gene set revealed enrichment for
myeloid-differentiation programs, corroborating at the gene
level the FUS–ERG-imposed block of retinoic acid-induced
differentiation.
The repressive activities of FUS–ERG toward myeloiddifferentiation genes including master regulators of hematopoieisis, such as SPI1, GATA2, GFI1, JUNB or JUNC, mimic the molecular
effects previously reported for other oncofusion proteins such as
AML1–ETO20 and PML–RARA,37,44 which target many of the
same genes as FUS–ERG. Both AML1–ETO and PML–RARA have
been shown to multimerize and recruit histone deacetylase
activities in order to repress target gene transcription.45–49
Oncogene (2016) 1965 – 1976

As FUS–ERG-binding sites harbor multiple ETS consensus
sequences and the oncofusion protein through its FUS domain
might also have oligomerization capacity,50 it is tempting to
speculate that FUS–ERG might use a similar mechanism to inhibit
transcription.
Together our results reveal that FUS–ERG has a key role in
t(16;21) AMLs, through aberrant regulation of the ATRA response
and inhibiting differentiation along the myeloid lineage.

the human genome HG18 using the eland program allowing 1 mismatch
or Burrows-Wheeler Aligner.53 For each base pair in the genome, the
number of overlapping sequence reads was determined and averaged
over a 10-bp window and visualized in the UCSC genome browser (http://
genome.ucsc.edu). A list of the ChIP-seq proﬁles analyzed in this study can
