Abstract
Anticancer drug efﬁcacy might be leveraged by strategies to target certain biochemical adaptations of tumors.
Here we show how depriving cancer cells of glutamine can enhance the anticancer properties of 3-bromopyruvate, a halogenated analog of pyruvic acid. Glutamine deprival potentiated 3-bromopyruvate chemotherapy by
increasing the stability of the monocarboxylate transporter-1, an effect that sensitized cells to metabolic oxidative
stress and autophagic cell death. We further elucidated mechanisms through which resistance to chemopotentiation by glutamine deprival could be circumvented. Overall, our ﬁndings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept
for how to employ 3-bromopyruvate or other monocarboxylic-based drugs to sensitize tumors to chemotherapy.

Introduction
Cancer cells differ from untransformed ones by a plethora of
bioenergetic and metabolic changes to sustain their high rate
of growth and proliferation (1). Therefore, targeting metabolic
adaptations has the potential to affect speciﬁcally cancer cells.
In particular, inhibitors of glycolysis and drugs impairing
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) have
been exploited to target malignancies on the basis of their
capability to elicit metabolic oxidative stress, culminating with
cell demise by apoptosis or autophagic cell death (2–5). To
drive clinical translation of these drugs, growing interest is
aimed at identifying metabolic conditions able to enhance
their killing properties, improve selectivity toward neoplastic
tissues, and reduce side effects.
Glutamine complements glucose to meet the speciﬁc energetic and anabolic requirements of growing tumor cells (1, 6, 7).
Indeed, its uptake and metabolism are strongly enhanced in
cancer cells to fulﬁll ATP needs, to refuel Krebs cycle of
metabolites constantly used for nucleotides and lipids biosynthesis as well as to modulate redox homeostasis (6, 7). To target
glutamine-addicted tumors, growing interest has been recently
arousing in the development of chemotherapeutics that

suppress glutamine-dependent anaplerosis (8, 9) and lower
blood glutamine levels (7, 10, 11). However, feasible antitumor
strategies inhibiting glutamine uptake in cancer cells have not
been explored yet.
3-Bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) is a halogenated and alkylating
analog of pyruvic acid able to curb the growth of many tumors,
frequently refractory to standard therapeutics, by compromising ATP synthesis through the inhibition of glycolysis and
mitochondrial complex II activity (12–16). In accordance with
current challenges aimed at identifying metabolic conditions
chemopotentiating the effectiveness of antitumor drugs, our
study argues for the ability of glutamine deprivation to sensitize carcinoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of 3-BrPA both in
vitro and in vivo. We show that glutamine deprivation stimulates the intracellular uptake of 3-BrPA that results in the
enhanced generation of metabolic oxidative stress, mainly
dependent on the inhibition of mitochondrial complex II,
responsible, in turn, for the ﬁnal induction of autophagic cell
death. Our results identify, in monocarboxylate transporter-1
(MCT-1), the molecular determinant responsible for the
enhanced uptake and cytotoxicity of 3-BrPA and, in glutamine
synthetase expression, the molecular device exploited by cancer cells to circumvent 3-BrPA chemopotentiation. Overall, our
study represents proof-of-principle that anticancer effects can
be potentiated by combining monocarboxylic-based drugs
with strategies to deprive tumors of glutamine.

diacetate (DCFH-DA) from Invitrogen-Molecular Probes; goat
anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chains)–
horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. If not otherwise indicated, all other chemicals were
obtained from Merck.
HeLa (human cervix carcinoma), DU145 (hormone-insensitive and prostate antigen–defective human prostate carcinoma), PC-3 (bone metastasis–derived grade IV human
prostatic adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (pleural effusion–
derived human mammary gland adenocarcinoma) and T47D (pleural effusion–derived inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma
of the mammary gland) cells were purchased from the
European Collection of Cell Culture and grown in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. All cell lines were periodically authenticated by morphologic inspection and tested negative for Mycoplasma
contamination by PCR tests from 2010 to 2012. The cells
were maintained at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in air and
routinely trypsinized and plated at 4  104/cm2 on ﬂasks.
Cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion. Primary
cervix endometrial cells (PCEC) were enzymatically isolated
from the mouse uterus. Uterine tissues were obtained from
immature (3.5 to 4 weeks of age) C57BL/6 mice to avoid
complications related to estrous cycle. Isolated endometrial
cells were resuspended in DMEM/F-12 culture medium
containing 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, plated at a density of about 1.4  106 cells/mL
onto collagen-coated cell culture plates and incubated at
37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in air for 3 days before being
used.
If not otherwise indicated, glutamine deprivation was carried out by incubating cells for 12 hours in glutamine-free
medium. Cell death was assessed after 24 hours of 3-BrPA
incubation by the Trypan blue exclusion assay. A 10 mmol/L
solution of 3-BrPA (Sigma) was prepared just before the
experiments by dissolving the powder in PBS, adjusted to pH
7.0 with NaOH. The antioxidants, the autophagy inhibitor, the
pan-caspase inhibitor, and the glutamine synthetase inhibitor
were added upon glutamine deprivation and maintained
throughout the experiment. The SLC1A5 inhibitor, the glutaminase inhibitor, the glutamate dehydrogenase inhibitor, and
the transaminase inhibitor were preincubated for 12 hours in
glutamine-containing medium and maintained throughout
the experiment. The MCTs inhibitor and the SMCTs inhibitor
were preincubated for 1 hour in glutamine-deprived medium
and maintained throughout the experiment. Staurosporine
and 2-DG were added in glutamine-containing or glutamine-deprived medium. CHX was added in glutamine-containing or glutamine-deprived medium after 6 hours of glutamine
deprivation.
Cells were transfected by electroporation using a Gene
Pulser Xcell system (Bio-Rad). siRNA were used to knockdown
MCT-1 and Atg5. Stable knockdown of SDHA expression was
carried out by transfecting cells with a pSuper vector carrying a

short hairpin RNA sequence against SDHA (shSDHA). pCI-neo,
pCDNA3, and pEGFP-C2 constructs were used to overexpress
MCT-1, DN-GS, and LC3-EGFP, respectively.
A total of 4  106 HeLa cells were injected subcutaneously
into adult female (6 weeks old) Hsd: Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu
mice (Harlan Laboratories). After 30 days, animals were randomized into 4 different groups, containing 5 mice each one,
which were intraperitoneally daily injected with freshly prepared 3-BrPA (1.25 mg/kg), GPNA (20 mg/kg), or the combination of both compounds. Tumor lengths (L) and widths (W)
of sagittal sections were measured 3 times per week by manual
caliper. After 14 days, mice were sacriﬁced. Tumor weights
were measured and tumor volumes were calculated by the
formula: Tumor volume ¼ 0.5  L  W2. Tumor growth has
been reported as % of tumor volume increase with respect to
the beginning of treatment.
Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) levels were assessed cytoﬂuorimetrically
upon DCFH-DA and AO staining, respectively. Carbonylated
proteins, ATP levels and intracellular glutamine concentration
were detected using the Oxyblot Kit (Intergen), the ATP
Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II (Roche Applied Science),
and the glutamine assay kit (Abnova), respectively.
The activity of complex II (succinate:coenzyme Q oxidoreductase activity), glutamine synthetase, and extracellular lactate were assessed spectrophotometrically as described in
detail in Supplementary Data.
Measurement of 3-BrPA levels in cell medium was achieved
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In particular, HeLa cells were treated with 50 mmol/L 3-BrPA-3-13C
(Sigma) for 1 hour. Cell media were harvested, centrifuged at
900  g for 5 minutes, and supernatants incubated with 70%
ethanol. After centrifugation at 20,000  g for 30 minutes,
supernatant were dried and suspended in 20% D2O, ﬁltered
and placed in a 5-mm NMR tube. 13C spectra were obtained
at 176.054 MHz by using a Bruker Avance 700 Ultrashield
spectrometer.
Data signiﬁcance was evaluated using a Student t test
corrected by Bonferroni method. P values less than 0.05 were
considered signiﬁcant.
Clonogenic assay, qPCR subcellular fractionation, and Western blotting procedures as well as a complete and detailed

Results
Glutamine deprivation potentiates antitumor activity of
3-BrPA
To evaluate the capability of glutamine to modulate
sensitivity of carcinoma cells to 3-BrPA, we incubated glutamine-addicted cervix carcinoma HeLa cells in glutaminefree culture medium for different hours before challenging
with subtoxic doses of 3-BrPA and measured cell viability 24
hours after drug addition. Figure 1A shows that 12-hour
glutamine deprivation was able to sensitize HeLa cells to 3BrPA cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, glutamine withdrawal did not modulate the sensitivity of
mouse PCECs, the untransformed counterpart of HeLa cells,

to 3-BrPA challenge (Fig. 1B), suggesting that 3-BrPA chemopotentiation is a cancer-speciﬁc phenomenon. To validate the ability of glutamine to increase 3-BrPA chemoresistance in other cancer cells, we incubated human prostate
carcinoma PC3 and DU145 cells with 3-BrPA after glutamine
deprivation. Similarly to HeLa cells, glutamine withdrawal
increased 3-BrPA cytotoxicity in both these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Next, we investigated whether the
enhancement of 3-BrPA effects could be phenocopied by
the pharmacologic inhibition of glutamine uptake. Therefore, HeLa cells were incubated for 12 hours with GPNA, the
speciﬁc inhibitor of SLC1A5, the main transporter mediating
glutamine uptake in carcinoma cells (17) and, then, exposed
to 3-BrPA. Results obtained showed that GPNA pretreatment was effective in enhancing HeLa cells sensitivity to 3BrPA (Fig. 1C) and in lowering intracellular glutamine
content (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To assess the long-term effects of 3-BrPA chemopotentiation on cell growth and survival, clonogenic assay was
carried out on glutamine-starved or GPNA-preincubated

HeLa cells. Glutamine deprivation, as well as SLC1A5 inhibition, reduced the clonogenic and reproductive potential of
HeLa cells after 3-BrPA challenge (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Next we evaluated the capability of GPNA to potentiate
anticancer activity of 3-BrPA in vivo. To this aim, nude mice
harboring HeLa tumor xenografts were treated with 3-BrPA
(1.25 mg/kg), GPNA (20 mg/kg), or the combination of
both compounds for 14 days. Figure 1D shows that,
although the drugs had no effect when used alone, they
signiﬁcantly affected tumor growth when used in combination. Then, we explored whether apoptosis was engaged for
the execution of 3-BrPA–induced cell death elicited upon
glutamine restrictive conditions. As displayed in Supplementary Fig. S1D, no signiﬁcant changes in the apoptotic extent
was measured in 3-BrPA–treated cells with respect to
untreated counterparts, regardless of glutamine supplementation. Moreover, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk
failed to inhibit 3-BrPA cytotoxicity (Supplementary
Fig. S1E), thereby allowing us to exclude apoptosis in cell
death execution.

Glutamine Deprivation Induces 3-BrPA Chemopotentiation

Autophagy is involved in 3-BrPA–induced cell death
upon glutamine withdrawal
Because apoptosis was not associated with 3-BrPA–induced
cell death, we evaluated whether autophagy was induced in our
conditions. Therefore, we measured the levels of AVOs, produced upon 3-BrPA challenge. Results obtained in HeLa
cells (Fig. 2A) as well as PC3 and DU145 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2A) indicated that glutamine deprivation generated
AVOs, whose levels further increased upon 3-BrPA treatment.
Similar evidence were obtained inhibiting glutamine uptake by
GPNA incubation (Fig. 2A). To deﬁne the autophagic nature of
3-BrPA–induced AVOs, we measured, by Western blotting, the
levels of the autophagosome-associated form of LC3 (LC3-II)
and the autophagy-degraded protein p62. In line with data
from literature (17), glutamine-deprived as well as GPNAincubated cells underwent autophagy (Fig. 2B). Moreover,
glutamine withdrawal and GPNA pretreatment primed HeLa
cells to undergo a higher autophagic activity upon 3-BrPA

challenge, as indicated by the enhanced accumulation of LC3-II
and degradation of p62 with respect to their 3-BrPA–untreated
counterparts (Fig 2B). To corroborate this data, the intracellular distribution of LC3 in LC3-EGFP–transfected HeLa cells
was examined. Glutamine deprivation induced a change in the
distribution of LC3 ﬂuorescence from a diffuse to a punctate
cytosolic pattern (Fig. 2C), typical of cells undergoing autophagy. Moreover, an enhanced percentage of LC3-GFP dotted
cells was observed upon 3-BrPA challenge in glutaminestarved cells with respect to their unchallenged counterparts
(Fig. 2C). Coincubation with NH4Cl, which blocks autophagic
degradation, enhanced 3-BrPA–induced accumulation of LC3GFP–punctate cells, conﬁrming that 3-BrPA cytotoxicity is
associated with a sustained autophagic ﬂux in absence of
glutamine. Enhanced autophagy induction was observed in
PC3 and DU145 cells, as well (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Furthermore, Western blot analysis of excised tumor
tissues indicated that the slower tumor growth observed in

GPNA/3-BrPA–cotreated mice was associated with a higher
autophagic activity compared with both vehicle and single
drug-treated mice (Fig. 2D). As autophagy can mediate cell
death (type II or autophagic cell death), we evaluated its
contribution in 3-BrPA cytotoxicity. To this aim, we treated
cells with 3-Ma, an inhibitor of initiation steps of autophagy,
and evaluated cell viability upon 3-BrPA treatment. In line with
the prosurvival role of autophagy upon nutrient limitation, 3Ma induced a slight increase of cell death in glutaminedeprived cells (Fig. 2E). However, it signiﬁcantly decreased
3-BrPA chemopotentiation, as the percentage of dead cells was
almost halved (Fig. 2E) and inhibited autophagosomes formation, as shown by the signiﬁcant decrease of LC3-II levels
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). This ﬁnding was substantiated by
experiments carried out in PC3 and DU145 cells, as well
(Supplementary Fig. S2D). To conﬁrm the role of autophagy
in cell demise, we silenced the expression of Atg5, an essential
protein for autophagosomes formation. siRNA-mediated
knockdown of Atg5 decreased cell death extent upon 3-BrPA
addition (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S2E) and reduced
autophagy (Supplementary Fig. S2F), thereby resembling the
effects of 3-Ma.
Mitochondrial complex II inhibition accounts for
3-BrPA–induced metabolic oxidative stress upon
glutamine deprivation
In accordance with data from literature, we hypothesized
that 3-BrPA chemopotentiation could result from the generation of bioenergetics crisis elicited by the simultaneous
dampening of glutaminolytic route, caused by glutamine
withdrawal, and the inhibition of glycolysis, elicited by 3BrPA (scheme of Supplementary Fig. S3A). To address this
issue, we measured intracellular ATP content (Fig. 3A) and
extracellular lactate levels (Supplementary Fig. S3B) after 3BrPA treatment. In line with the ability of glutamine to
sustain ATP synthesis and lactate generation, glutaminedeprived HeLa cells exhibited a more pronounced reduction
in both analytes levels in resting conditions and whenever
treated with 3-BrPA, with respect to their glutamine-fed
counterparts. To unravel the role of glycolytic dampening in
3-BrPA cytotoxicity, we supplemented glutamine-free medium with methyl pyruvate, the cell-permeable form of the
glycolytic endpoint product pyruvate. Methyl pyruvate
refueling did not prevent decrease of ATP and viability upon
3-BrPA challenge (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Moreover, the
failure of glutamine starvation to chemopotentiate 2-DeoxyD-glucose (2-DG; Supplementary Fig. S3E), a glycolytic inhibitor more efﬁcient in reducing lactate levels than 3-BrPA
(Supplementary Fig. S3D), suggests that 3-BrPA chemopotentiation was not dependent on glycolysis block in our
experimental conditions. Next, we challenged HeLa cells
with 3-BrPA upon pharmacologic inhibition of speciﬁc
glutaminolytic enzymes (scheme of Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Inhibition of glutaminolysis did not chemopotentiate
3-BrPA (Supplementary Fig. S3F). Furthermore, supplementation of glutamine-free medium with glutamate, the ﬁrst
metabolite generated from oxidative deamination of glutamine, did not prevent 3-BrPA cytotoxicity (Supplementary

Glutamine Deprivation Induces 3-BrPA Chemopotentiation

Fig. S3F), suggesting that reduction of glutaminolytic ﬂux
was not responsible for 3-BrPA chemopotentiation.
It has been previously reported that ROS underlie 3-BrPA
cytotoxicity (18). To evaluate whether 3-BrPA affected cellular
redox state, we measured the intracellular levels of ROS
(Fig. 3B) and protein carbonyls (Fig. 3C), by-products of
ROS-mediated damages, after 3 hours of 3-BrPA treatment.
Results provided evidence that both 3-BrPA-generated analytes accumulated preferentially in glutamine-deprived HeLa
cells than in glutamine-supplemented counterparts. Moreover,
incubation of HeLa cells with the antioxidants and radical
scavangers NAC or DMTU prevented 3-BrPA–mediated cell
death (Fig. 3D), induction of autophagy (Fig. 3E), protein
carbonylation (Supplementary Fig. S4A), and ATP loss (Supplementary Fig. S4B), providing the functional link between the
generation of pro-oxidant conditions, the onset of energetic
stress, and the execution of cell death by autophagy.
3-BrPA has been reported to inhibit mitochondrial complex
II (13, 19, 20). In line with these data, we found that 3-BrPA
elicited a greater inhibition of complex II activity in glutaminestarved cells with respect to glutamine-fed counterparts
(Fig. 3F). Electrons escaping from the redox core of complex
II, negatively affected by mutations or chemically inhibited,
partially reduce O2 and produce ROS (3, 20, 21); furthermore,
ROS generated by OXPHOS inhibitors are prone to affect
cellular energetics and elicit autophagic cell death (5, 22, 23).
Therefore, we hypothesized that accumulation of ROS elicited
by 3-BrPA–mediated complex II inhibition could underlie the
induction of type-II cell death upon glutamine withdrawal. To
verify this hypothesis, we blunted complex II activity by stably
silencing the expression of SDHA (Supplementary Fig. S5A and
B), the subunit responsible for succinate oxidation and electrons entering into the redox core of complex II (24, 25).
Silenced SDHA cells (shSDHA) showed lower amount of protein
carbonyls (Fig. 3G) and maintained higher ATP levels (Supplementary Fig. S5C) upon 3-BrPA treatment. Moreover, they were
almost insensitive to 3-BrPA–induced cytotoxicity as shown by
the lower cell death extent (Fig. 3H) and autophagic activity
(Supplementary Fig. S5D) with respect to their controls. Moreover, in line with their lower sensitivity to the drug (Supplementary Fig. S5E), we found that PCEC were characterized by a
lower complex II activity with respect to tumor counterparts
(Supplementary Fig. S5E), thereby substantiating the role of
complex II as pivotal target underlying 3-BrPA cytotoxicity.
Chemopotentiation of 3-BrPA depends on the reduced
degradation of MCT-1
To unravel the mechanisms responsible for the potentiation
of 3-BrPA–induced metabolic oxidative stress, we postulated
that removal of glutamine from culture medium might stimulate the intracellular drug uptake. To evaluate drug internalization, we measured the decrease of 3-BrPA levels in cell
media after 1 hour of treatment, by means of NMR spectroscopy. Glutamine-deprived cells displayed a signiﬁcant
decrease of extracellular 3-BrPA content with respect to the
glutamine-supplemented counterparts (Fig. 4A), indicating
that the presence of this amino acid in cell medium strongly
inﬂuenced the efﬁciency of drug internalization. 3-BrPA

alternatively with a-CHC, a speciﬁc pharmacologic inhibitor of
MCTs, and ibuprofen, a blocker of SMCTs. a-CHC, but not
ibuprofen, rescued HeLa cells from 3-BrPA–induced cell death
upon glutamine starvation (Supplementary Fig. S6A), suggesting that MCT-dependent 3-BrPA uptake could be operative in
our experimental conditions. a-CHC preferentially inhibits
MCT-1 member of MCTs family (26). Therefore, we hypothesized that this transporter could be involved in the enhanced
uptake of 3-BrPA upon glutamine starvation. To address this
issue, we analyzed by Western blotting the intracellular content of MCT-1 in dependence on glutamine availability.
Twelve-hour glutamine deprived (Fig. 4B) and GPNA-treated
HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B) displayed higher levels of
MCT-1, with respect to their glutamine-fed and GPNA-untreated counterparts. Glutamine deprivation–induced MCT-1 upregulation was also observed in PC3 and DU145 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6C) and was coupled to the enhanced localization of the transporter in the plasma membrane (Fig. 4C). As
documented in literature (27), MCT-1 upregulation was not
due to a stimulation of MCT-1 transcription. Indeed, no
signiﬁcant differences in MCT-1 mRNA levels were measured
in HeLa cells, regardless of glutamine supplementation (Supplementary Fig. S6E). This evidence prompted us to postulate a
role of glutamine as modulator of MCT-1 stability. To assess
this issue, we starved cells of glutamine for 6 hours; then, cell
media were replaced with glutamine-free or glutamine-containing ones in the presence of CHX for additional 3 hours.
Glutamine-refueled cells showed a deeper reduction in MCT-1
protein content with respect to glutamine-deprived cells,
indicating that this amino acid affects MCT-1 protein degradation (Fig. 4D). To evaluate whether the upregulated levels of
MCT-1 could facilitate the drug uptake, we stably overexpressed MCT-1 (pCI-MCT-1; Supplementary Fig. S7A). pCIMCT-1 displayed a signiﬁcant decrease of extracellular 3-BrPA
levels with respect to their mock counterparts, indicating that
MCT-1 upregulation strongly stimulated drug internalization
(Fig. 4E). Interestingly, MCT-1 overexpression was sufﬁcient to
increase 3-BrPA toxicity, as shown by cell death (Fig. 4F), ATP
drop (Supplementary Fig. S7B), and protein carbonylation
(Supplementary Fig. S7C) with respect to mock counterparts.
In agreement with the enhanced sensitivity of pCI-MCT-1 cells
to the drug, siRNA-mediated MCT-1 silencing (Supplementary
Fig. S7D) almost completely abolished 3-BrPA chemopotentiation (Fig. 4G). These results were supported by the reduction of
protein carbonyls content (Supplementary Fig. S7E), the maintenance of ATP levels (Supplementary Fig. S7F), and inhibition
of autophagic ﬂux (Supplementary Fig. S7G). The link between
MCT-1 upregulation and enhancement of 3-BrPA cytotoxicity
prompted us to investigate whether the cytotoxic effects of
other monocarboxylic drugs could be potentiated upon glutamine withdrawal, by capitalizing on MCT-1 upregulation. To
this aim, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of DCA, anticancer drug
able to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (28, 29) in
dependence on glutamine availability and MCT-1 expression.
Similarly to 3-BrPA, DCA was able to be chemopotentiated
upon glutamine deprivation (Supplementary Fig. S7H) or
inhibition of its uptake (Supplementary Fig. S7I) as well as by
MCT-1 overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S7J), providing a

4532

proof-of-principle that cytotoxic effects of monocarboxylic
chemotherapeutics can be enhanced by strategies limiting
glutamine availability.
Glutamine synthetase is involved in circumvention of 3BrPA chemopotentiation
Glutamine synthetase, the enzyme catalyzing glutamine
biosynthesis, is expressed differentially among cancer cells,
representing one of genetic determinants of cell type–speciﬁc
glutamine independence (30). On the basis of the tight liaison
among glutamine availability, MCT-1 expression and cell
sensitivity to 3-BrPA, we hypothesized that glutamine deprivation should predict 3-BrPA chemopotentiation only in glutamine-addicted tumors, expressing low levels of glutamine
synthetase. To validate this assumption, we compared glutamine synthetase activity among different tumor cells. MCF-7
and T-47D, 2 breast cancer cell lines, are characterized by a
higher glutamine synthetase activity with respect to HeLa,
DU145, and PC3 cells (Fig. 5A). Consistent with this feature,
glutamine content of glutamine-deprived MCF-7 and T-47D
was signiﬁcantly higher than the other 3 carcinoma cells
(Supplementary Fig. S8A). Moreover, MCF-7 and T-47D
become sensitive to 3-BrPA only upon glutamine synthetase
inhibition, achieved either by incubating cells with MSO, the
speciﬁc pharmacologic inhibitor of glutamine synthetase
(Fig. 5B) or overexpressing a dominant-negative form of this
enzyme (DN-GS; Supplementary Fig. S8B and C). In accordance
with these results, MCT-1 upregulation was observed only in
glutamine-free medium upon inhibition of glutamine synthetase activity (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S8D). Overall,
these results identiﬁed the molecular strategy exploited by
cancer cells to circumvent 3-BrPA chemopotentiation.

Discussion
Targeting metabolic adaptations of cancer cells has the
potential to chemopotentiate antitumor drugs (2, 9, 31). In
line with this concept, we show that depriving cancer cells of
glutamine or drugging the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 by
GPNA represent a feasible strategy to potentiate antitumor
effects of 3-BrPA, both in vitro and in vivo, setting the stage
for its clinical use against glutamine-addicted malignancies
(Supplementary Fig. S9). Although 3-BrPA has antitumor effect
on multiple cancer cell types, no trials attesting its clinical
use are so far documentable, probably because of the putative
side effects resulting from its alkylating properties. Therefore,
in line with recent investigations focused on identifying strategies to chemopotentiate 3-BrPA effectiveness (15, 32, 33),
here we show that reduction of intracellular glutamine pool
enhances the antitumor efﬁcacy of 3-BrPA in vivo, avoiding
thus, its putative deleterious noxious effects on normal cells.
Bringing further insights into the mechanism of action, we
show that, upon glutamine withdrawal, 3-BrPA cytotoxicity
depends on the generation of metabolic oxidative stress mainly
resulting from the inhibition of complex II. Although we did not
investigate the 3-BrPA target sites into complex II, this report is
the ﬁrst in elucidating the effective contribution of complex II
inhibition in the induction of 3-BrPA–mediated cell death.
Moreover, strengthening the growing consensus depicting

complex II as a therapeutic target in cancer (3), our data
highlights the preferential usage of ROS-generating complex
II inhibitors against epithelial cancers, on the basis of the
higher complex II activity and, consequently, the greater
capability to generate oxidative stress, with respect to untransformed epithelial cells.
Some reports have described autophagy stimulation in
response to 3-BrPA challenge (34), but no evidence of its
involvement as mechanism of death elicited by 3-BrPA had
been provided so far. We show that, upon glutamine withdrawal, autophagy contributes to the execution of 3-BrPA–
induced cell death. Interestingly, supporting the well-recognized capability of many chemotherapeutics to induce autophagic cancer cell death in vivo (35, 36), our results strengthen
the feasible application of therapeutic regimens exploiting
autophagy as an effective cancer cell killing strategy, particularly to target apoptosis-resistant cells.
We provide evidence that 3-BrPA chemopotentiation
depends on its more efﬁcient uptake. Indeed, glutamine starvation primed cells to a higher intracellular drug internalization, thus resulting in a sustained metabolic oxidative stress
that culminates in cell death. 3-BrPA belongs to the class of
monocarboxylic acid drugs whose uptake is mediated by both
MCTs and SMCTs (37). Although a strong correlation between
MCTs expression and 3-BrPA sensitivity has been already
reported (38, 39), kinetic measurements documenting its afﬁnity for 3-BrPA are available only for SMCT-1, which rather is

epigenetically silenced during tumorigenesis (18, 40). Furthermore, 3-BrPA is effective in reducing the viability of many
tumors defective of SMCT-1 expression (18), including cancer
cells employed in this study (data not shown). Therefore, the
effective uptake of 3-BrPA in cancer cells through this subset of
transporters remains questionable, making MCTs, which are
overexpressed in many tumors (41), the most reasonable
candidates for its internalization (18, 39). In agreement with
these observations, our study indicates MCT-1 as a candidate
for 3-BrPA uptake upon glutamine deprivation. Indeed, (i)
MCT-1 half-life is increased upon glutamine starvation, (ii)
3-BrPA internalization and cytotoxicity is stimulated by MCT-1
overexpression, and (iii) MCT-1 silencing prevents 3-BrPA–
induced metabolic oxidative stress and cell death. The tight
liaison between glutamine availability, MCT-1 expression, and
3-BrPA cytotoxicity is further highlighted by the observation
that cells able to maintain a high intracellular glutamine
content, in absence of its exogenous supplementation, do not
upregulate MCT-1 levels, thereby circumventing 3-BrPA chemopotentiation. We substantiate that the independence on
exogenous glutamine of these cell types is due to a high
glutamine synthetase activity, which, ensuring a high intracellular glutamine content, restrains them from upregulating
MCT-1 and chemopotentiating 3-BrPA. Besides providing a
mechanistic explanation of resistance to 3-BrPA chemopotentiation, our ﬁndings elucidate also the metabolic rationale for
the assessment of the glutamine synthetase levels in tumors as

a valuable tool in predicting response to the combined therapy
described in this study. Indeed, MSO, the only speciﬁc glutamine synthetase inhibitor, is a toxic compound. Therefore, 3bromopyruvate chemopotentiation may not be applicable to
tumors that are capable of synthesizing glutamine for as long
as a safe procedure is designed to inhibit glutamine synthetase
activity.
The capability of glutamine to regulate MCT-1 stability
ﬁnds support in studies documenting the capability of this
amino acid to modulate protein turnover by stimulating
protein ubiquitination (42). Intracellular glutamine availability, indeed, is known to negatively affect the stability of
(i) p65 subunit of NF-kB transcription factor, thereby
protecting against inﬂammatory conditions (43) and (ii)
glutamine synthetase, thereby maintaining in check the
intracellular concentration of glutamine upon resting conditions and allowing its biosynthesis upon nitrogen starvation (44). Generally, membrane proteins stability depends
on their trafﬁcking from plasma membrane to endosomal/
lysosomal compartments. As ubiquitination facilitates
endocytosis of such proteins, thereby reducing their cellsurface localization and intracellular abundance (45, 46), it
is reasonable to hypothesize that glutamine might regulate
MCT-1 turnover by inducing its ubiquitination and delivery
to the endosomal/lysosomal degradation pathway. Work is
presently underway in our laboratory to deeply address this
issue.
MCT-1 overexpression is part of an adaptive reprogramming aimed to extrude lactate from highly glycolytic cancer
cells in the hypoxic regions of solid tumors (47). This
transporter, indeed, has been identiﬁed as a therapeutic
target in cancer, because its inhibition decreases intracellular pH, causing cell death (26, 41). However, emerging
ﬁndings describe MCT-1 as an inward transporter. According to the "stromal-epithelial" lactate shuttle in tumors,
MCT-1 allows the uptake of lactate, ketones, and other
metabolites released by stromal ﬁbroblasts in the extracellular milieu to refuel epithelial cancer cells within the same
tumors (46). Interestingly, although MCT-1 expression is
affected by hypoxia (48), no data documenting its modulation in response to nutrient availability had been provided so
far. Although we did not investigate the role of MCT-1
upregulation in glutamine-deprived cells, at least one
hypothesis can be formulated. Interruption of glutamine
availability in glutamine-addicted cells induces compensatory mechanisms catalyzed by the pyruvate carboxylase,
allowing cells to use glucose-derived pyruvate, rather than
glutamine, for Krebs cycle anaplerosis (49). Therefore, we
can hypothesize that MCT-1 upregulation could be part of a
biochemical reprogramming enabling glutamine-deprived
cancer cells to take up extracellular lactate or pyruvate to
fulﬁll anaplerotic requirements by sustaining pyruvate
carboxylase activity. Hence, on the basis of its elevated

expression in tumors and modulation in response to environmental conditions, MCT-1 could be considered as a
"Trojan horse" that allows chemotherapeutics structurally
related to monocarboxylates to enter into cancer cells and
selectively kill them. Although our study identify 3-BrPA as a
feasible candidate in exploiting metabolic adaptations of
glutamine-deprived tumors, it can be suggested that other
monocarboxylic anticancer drugs, such as DCA could be
chemopotentiated in vivo by capitalizing on MCT-1 stabilization. Therefore, this study represents a proof-of-concept
that anticancer effects can be enhanced by combining
monocarboxylic-based chemotherapeutics with strategies
depriving glutamine pool of tumor cells. Although this
strategy could be potentially adopted for treating every
glutamine-addicted tumors, glutamine deprivation may be
of limited value for treatment of brain malignancies. Indeed,
because glutamine is a molecule critical for neurotransmission and neuron–astrocyte metabolic cycles, its deprivation
could severely impair function of brain region involved.
Moreover, it is known that glioma cells react to glutamine
deprivation with modiﬁcation of amino acid transport
involving the different ASC system variants (50), the consequences of which for 3-BrPA therapy could be difﬁcult to
predict.
In conclusion, our results identify the metabolic conditions
to increase the selectivity and sensitivity of 3-BrPA targets in
neoplastic tissues and the mechanisms of tumor resistance to
its chemopotentiation, thereby driving the process of clinical
translation of this drug for glutamine-addicted malignancies.
