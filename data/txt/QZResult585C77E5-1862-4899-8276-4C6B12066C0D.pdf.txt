BACKGROUND: There is no effective second-line systemic chemotherapy for patients with disease progression after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. A phase 2 trial of sorafenib was performed to determine the activity and toxicity of this agent in a multi-institutional setting in patients previously treated with 1 prior
chemotherapy regimen. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma were
treated with sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
RESULTS: There were no objective responses observed. The 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate
was 9.5%; median overall survival of the group was 6.8 months. There were no therapy-related deaths, and
common grade 3 toxicities included fatigue and hand-foot syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Although sorafenib
as a single agent has minimal activity in patients with advanced urothelial cancer in the second-line setting,
further investigation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors using different trial designs with PFS endpoints is warC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Over the last 20 years, cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been established as the standard of care in the
management of patients with advanced urothelial cancer. For the fit patient with preserved renal function,
cisplatin-based multiagent chemotherapy with either gemcitabine þ cisplatin (GC) or methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) is supported by randomized trial evidence of benefit.1,2
Unfortunately only a relatively small percentage of patients are cured with either GC or M-VAC.3,4
During the past 2 decades, a clinically evident stage migration5 has led to earlier appreciation of metastatic
disease. Concomitantly, there has been an increased utilization of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy,
resulting in an increasing proportion of patients fit enough to be considered for second-line chemotherapy for
metastatic disease. Recent phase 2 studies evaluating second-line chemotherapy have demonstrated objective
response rates in the 10% to 25% range for a variety of single agents and combination regimens.6-8 Although

platinum-based chemotherapy are frequently treated with
salvage chemotherapy, this is done primarily with palliative intent, as there is no evidence that such therapy
improves progression-free or overall survival.9
Urothelial cancer has a myriad of molecular targets
that make it attractive for the investigation of novel
agents; however, in contrast to the more common epithelial cancers, there have been limited efforts to evaluate
novel agents in this disease. Although the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in high-grade urothelial cancer, several small
phase 2 trials of EGFR-targeted agents have failed to demonstrate meaningful activity.10,11
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binds to
its cognate receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, to induce
cell proliferation and migration. VEGF receptors are
expressed on urothelial carcinomas, and there is both preclinical and some clinical evidence supporting the antitumor efficacy of targeting this pathway.12-14
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor of VEGFR2,
VEGFR3, and platelet-derived growth factor receptorbeta.15 Evidence from phase 3 trials of improvement in
progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with clear renal cell carcinoma and hepatoma led to regulatory approval of sorafenib in these 2 relatively chemotherapyresistant epithelial neoplasms.16,17
Based on the need for more active agents and the
overexpression of VEGF and VEGFR in many patients
with advanced urothelial cancer, the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group investigated sorafenib in patients with
progressive advanced urothelial cancer after front-line
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed transitional
cell carcinoma (or mixed histologies containing a component of transitional cell carcinoma) of the urothelium
with evidence of progressive, bidimensionally measurable
regional or metastatic disease. Patients must have been
disease-free from prior malignancies for at least 5 years,
with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 0 to 1 at entry. Patients must have
demonstrated progressive disease after 1 and only 1 prior
systemic chemotherapy regimen administered in the metastatic setting. Prior perioperative therapy in either the
Cancer

neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting was permitted, provided
that it was completed >12 months before the chemotherapy administered in the metastatic setting. Patients must
have been at least 4 weeks out from major surgery.
Adequate renal and hepatic function were required, with a
serum creatinine <1.5 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) 2.5 mg/dL, and bilirubin 1.5 times the upper
limit of normal. Adequate bone marrow reserve was mandated with a requirement for neutrophils 1500 mm3
and a platelet count 100,000/lL at entry. Patients
requiring ongoing therapeutic anticoagulation or cytochrome p450 enzyme–inducing antiepileptic drugs, or
having a history of a bleeding diathesis, were excluded.
Sorafenib was administered orally at a dose of 400
mg (2 tablets) orally twice daily for a total daily dose of 800
mg. One cycle consisted of 56 days of therapy. Patients
were mandated to monitor and record their blood pressure
weekly during Cycle 1, then every cycle. No dose escalation
was permitted, dose modifications were mandated as follows: dose level 2, 400 mg/day; dose level 3, 400 mg every
other day. Dose modifications were specified for myelosuppression and mandated for any grade 3 or 4 toxicity.
Before study entry, all patients underwent physical
examination and had their ECOG performance status
and weight documented. There also were pretherapy complete blood count (CBC) and differential, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, AST, bilirubin, and computed
tomograms of chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A CBC and
the above chemistries were repeated on the first day of
each subsequent therapy cycle. Tumor measurements
were performed with each cycle of therapy.
Each site was required to have approval of this clinical trial by a local human investigations committee in
accord with an assurance filed with and approved by the
Department of Health and Human Services. All patients
provided written informed consent before registration
onto this study.
Tumor responses were analyzed using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.
National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria
(Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 3)
were used to analyze toxicity. Patients with objective
responses or stable disease were continued on therapy
until development of unacceptable toxicity.
The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the 4month PFS rate in patients treated with sorafenib. If this
4091

Original Article

treatment showed evidence of at least a 50% PFS rate at 4
months, it would be considered as a promising therapy for
further study. A PFS rate of 30% or less would not be of
interest. This cohort used a 2-stage design, with 4-month
PFS rate as the primary endpoint. At the initial stage, 20
eligible patients were to be entered, and accrual was to be
suspended. The first-stage stopping rule was based on
response rates. Responses were assessed using RECIST. If
no objective response was observed in the first 20 eligible
patients, the trial would be terminated. On the basis of
this stopping rule, the probability of terminating the study
early was 0.54 if the true underlying response rate was 3%
and 0.04 if the true rate was 15%. If 1 or more responses
were observed in the first 20 eligible patients, the study
was to accrue an additional 19 eligible patients for a total
of 39 eligible patients. If 16 or more patients were alive
and progression-free at 4 months among the 39 eligible
patients, the treatment would be considered worthy of
further consideration in this population.
Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the characteristics of the patients at study entry. Exact binomial
confidence intervals were computed for response rates.
The method of Kaplan and Meier was used to characterize
overall survival and PFS.18 Overall survival was computed
from the time of registration to death. PFS was computed
from the time of registration to death or progression,
whichever occurred first. Patients who were still alive and
progression free were censored at the date of last disease
assessment.

(64%). With respect to ECOG PS, 36% patients were
fully active (PS 0), and 64% had PS 1. Fifteen (68%)
patients had bladder as the site of tumor. By using the risk
factor status defined by Bajorin, 3 (14%) patients had 0
risk factors, and 19 (86%) had 1 risk factor.19 All 22
patients had been treated with multiagent cytotoxic systemic chemotherapy, 17 (77%) patients had undergone
surgery with therapeutic intent, and 6 (27%) had prior
radiation therapy (Table 1).

RESULTS
From October of 2005 through October of 2006, 27
patients from 14 ECOG institutions were entered into the
study and were evaluable for toxicity. Five of these patients
were classified as ineligible and were only included in
toxicity evaluations, 2 patients had ineligible lab values for
entry, 1 had a second cancer, and 2 were enrolled before
the 4-week interval from prior systemic therapy.
Patient Characteristics
All 22 eligible patients had tumors that were histologically
pure or predominantly transitional cell carcinoma.
Patients ranged in age from 37 to 81 years, with a median
of 66 years. Most patients were white (95%) and men
4092

Response Assessment
No response was observed among eligible patients. Three
(14%) patients had stable disease, and 9 (41%) had progression as their best overall response. Ten other patients
were deemed unevaluable for response, and 6 patients had
at least 1 follow-up assessment; however, they were not
performed within the mandated time frame. The remainder did not have follow-up imaging before death or removal from study either from clinical deterioration or
therapy-related toxicity. Fifteen (68%) patients went off
treatment because of disease progression, and 4 (18%)
because of excessive toxicity. Thirteen (59%) patients
received only 1 cycle of protocol therapy, 8 (36%)

received 2 cycles, and 1 (5%) received 4 cycles. Median
number of cycles administered was 1 (range, 1-4).
Among the 22 eligible patients, 18 (82%) had progressed and died as of March 5, 2008. Figure 1 shows
PFS. The 4-month PFS rate based on the Kaplan-Meier
method was 11.0% (90% confidence interval [CI], 0%23.0%). Median PFS was 2.2 months (90% CI, 1.8-3.7
months). Median survival was 6.8 months (90% CI, 5.78.5 months) (Fig. 2).

Therapy was relatively well tolerated, and although there
was a median 2-month survival advantage (6.9 vs 4.6
months), favoring the vinflunine arm, this difference had
not yet achieved statistical significance at the time of its
initial report.
There have been a small number of small phase 2 trials of targeted agents in advanced urothelial cancer, all but
1 in the salvage setting.
The potential for synergy between trastuzumab and
active chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced urothelial cancer, and reports of
HER-2/neu expression in urothelial cancers ranging from
approximately 10% to 80%, led Hussain and colleagues
to conduct a multicenter phase 2 trial of trastuzumab in
combination with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine. Eligible patients were required to have locally recurrent or metastatic disease, without prior chemotherapy for
metastatic disease. As the primary endpoint of the study
was cardiac toxicity, patients were mandated to have an
ejection fraction >50% and no evidence of ischemic heart
disease. HER-2/neu overexpression by either immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or elevated serum HER-2/neu electron-capture detection was
required. Forty-four of 57 HER-2/neu–positive patients
received protocol therapy. Myelosuppression was the
most common grade 3 and 4 toxicity, with 23% of
patients manifesting grade 1 to 3 cardiac toxicity. There
were 2 therapy-related deaths. Thirty-one (70%) of 44
patients responded (5 complete and 26 partial), and 25
(57%) of 44 were confirmed responses. Median survival
was 14.1 months.21

Toxicity
Toxicity from sorafenib was similar to that seen in a renal cancer population. There were no therapy-related
deaths. Two patients experienced grade 4 pulmonary
embolism (7.0%). Common grade 3 toxicities included
fatigue and hand-foot reaction, each occurring in 5
(19%) patients.

DISCUSSION
Despite the availability of several conventional cytotoxic
drugs with antitumor activity in patients with disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy, there
remains limited evidence that any single agent or combination regimen improves patient outcome.9 Bellmunt
and colleagues recently reported the results of a phase 3
trial comparing vinflunine (a microtubule inhibitor) plus
best supportive care versus best supportive care alone in
patients with advanced urothelial cancer whose disease
had progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy.20

The EGFR is overexpressed in high-grade urothelial
cancers, and the availability of a variety of EGFR-targeting agents made this an attractive target.22 In a phase 2
trial of gefitinib in the second-line setting, Southwest Oncology Group investigators observed only 1 (3%) partial
response in 29 enrolled patients.23 A Cancer and Leukaemia Group B study of cisplatin þ fixed dose rate
gemcitabine þ gefitinib was stopped early secondary to
unacceptable therapy-related toxicity primarily from the
fixed dose gemcitabine, and therefore the value of adding
gefitinib to the regimen was unevaluable.11
Wulfing et al conducted a phase 2 trial of lapatinib
(reversible dual inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer after progression on a cisplatin-based
regimen. Eligible patients were required to manifest
expression by immunohistochemistry of either HER-1 or
HER-2. Although therapy was well tolerated, only 1 of 59
enrolled patients demonstrated an objective response to
therapy.10 Unlike other epithelial cancers in which EGFR
domain mutations are relatively well understood, there
are limited data in urothelial cancer, and additional studies using monoclonal antibodies in combination with
chemotherapy are planned.
Investigators at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center conducted a single-institution phase 2 trial of sunitinib in patients with advanced disease progressing on
front-line chemotherapy for advanced disease. Sunitinib
was administered in conventional 6-week cycles, 50 mg/
day  4 weeks, with 2 weeks off. Forty-five patients were
enrolled, and toxicity was as would be expected with this
agent, although 1 patient died of therapy-related complications. Of 41 evaluable patients, 3 achieved a confirmed
partial response, with an additional 11 patients achieving
stable disease. Further follow-up will be needed to define
time to disease progression and survival. An additional
cohort of patients have been enrolled to study a continuous 37.5-mg dosing schedule.24
The current study demonstrates that sorafenib at
400 mg twice per day has no clinically meaningful activity
in patients with advanced urothelial cancer after front-line
chemotherapy. In retrospect, given the evolving understanding of sorafenib’s level of activity in advanced renal
cancer, it is not surprising that most patients manifested
early disease progression. Given the aggressive nature of
advanced urothelial cancer, only an agent or combination
4094

of agents with the ability to produce rapid objective
responses will likely demonstrate obvious clinical activity
in this setting. Testing agents like sorafenib in other settings of advanced urothelial cancer, that is, as maintenance therapy after an objective response to conventional
cytotoxic drugs using disease-free progression as a primary
endpoint, may provide a better assessment of this class of
agents in this disease.
