Abstract
Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) is a key player in
melanoma metastasis with higher expression seen in metastatic melanoma cell lines and tissue specimens. cDNA
microarray and Western blot analyses reveal that the gap
junctional intracellular communication molecule connexin 43
(Cx-43), known to be involved in tumor cell diapedesis and
attachment to endothelial cells, is significantly decreased after
PAR-1 silencing in metastatic melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, Cx-43 promoter activity was significantly inhibited in
PAR-1–silenced cells, suggesting that PAR-1 regulates Cx-43 at
the transcriptional level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
studies showed a reduction in the binding of SP-1 and AP-1
transcription factors to the promoter of Cx-43. Both transcription factors have been shown previously to be required
for maximal Cx-43 promoter activity. These results were
corroborated by mutating the AP-1 and SP-1 binding sites
resulting in decreased Cx-43 promoter activity in PAR-1–
positive cells. Moreover, as Cx-43 has been shown to facilitate
arrest of circulating tumor cells at the vascular endothelium,
melanoma cell attachment to endothelial cells was significantly decreased in PAR-1–silenced cells, with this effect being
abrogated after PAR-1 rescue. Herein, we report that upregulation of PAR-1 expression, seen in melanoma progression,
mediates high levels of Cx-43 expression. As both SP-1 and AP-1
transcription factors act as positive regulators of Cx-43, our
data provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of Cx-43
expression by PAR-1. Indeed, Cx-43 expression was restored
following PAR-1 rescue in PAR-1–silenced cells. Taken together,
our data support the tumor promoting function of Cx-43 in
melanoma. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6730–7]

Introduction
The thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), is
a transmembrane G-protein–coupled receptor that has been found
to be involved in many types of cancers. PAR-1 can be activated by
coagulation factor Xa, granzyme A, trypsin, and matrix metalloprotease-1, although thrombin is the most potent activator (1–4).
PAR-1 activation leads to induction of G proteins that trigger
various downstream molecules and signal transduction pathways
such as Rho kinase, phosphoinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-

activated protein kinase, which have been shown to be involved
in cell growth, tumor promotion, and carcinogenesis (5, 6).
PAR-1 overexpression has been found in various cancers,
including those of breast, lung, and prostate (7–11). Our laboratory
has found PAR-1 to be a key player in the progression of melanoma.
PAR-1 is overexpressed in metastatic melanoma cell lines
compared with nonmetastatic cell lines (12). Furthermore,
melanoma tumors have increased PAR-1 expression compared
with dysplastic nevi (13, 14). Recently, we have shown that silencing
PAR-1 via lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or through PAR-1
small interfering RNA-DOPC delivery significantly decreases both
melanoma tumor growth and metastasis (7). Based on these
results, we sought to determine, via cDNA microarray studies, novel
downstream gene targets regulated by PAR-1 that contribute to the
metastatic phenotype of melanoma. This led us to identify
connexin 43 (Cx-43) as a target gene of PAR-1.
Increased Cx-43 expression has been observed in several cancers,
including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gliomas
(15–18). Connexin gap junctions are intracellular membrane
channels that form when six connexin subunits are arranged to
form a pore. They align with complementary connexins on the
plasma membrane of adjacent cells. This allows for small
molecules (<1.2 kDa) such as Ca2+, secondary messengers, and
metabolic products to pass between neighboring cells, a process
known as gap junction intracellular communication. This process
appears to be key for maintaining tissue regulation, growth, and
proliferation (19, 20).
Unlike typical gap junctions, connexins are also considered
membrane proteins with adhesive properties (21, 22). The attachment of tumor cells in transition from a primary site to a secondary
organ site requires the attachment as well as the migration of tumor
cells through the vascular endothelium, a process known as tumor
cell diapedesis. It has been shown that, immediately following
adhesion to the endothelium, tumor cells establish gap junctional
channels with the endothelial cells. Several studies have found that
the communication between tumor cells and endothelial cells is
mediated by connexins and is critical to tumor cell extravasation at
the metastatic site (23–25). In fact, it has been reported that Cx-43–
mediated gap junctional communication enhances breast tumor cell
diapedesis (24). Furthermore, decreased Cx-43 expression reduced
adhesion of breast cancer cells to the pulmonary endothelium.
Moreover, up-regulation of Cx-43 was seen in tumor cell-endothelial
cell contact areas both in vivo and in vitro (26).
In melanoma, increased expression of Cx-43 has been implicated
in establishing a crucial link between melanoma cells and
endothelial cells, which enhances tumor metastasis (15, 17,
24–26). However, the exact mechanism by which Cx-43 is regulated
in melanoma cells is unknown. Herein, we describe that decreased
Cx-43 expression occurs through differential binding of AP-1 and
SP-1 transcription factors to the Cx-43 promoter mediated by

PAR-1. Furthermore, this results in a decrease in melanoma cell
attachment to endothelial cells. This is the first report to identify
PAR-1 as a regulator of Cx-43 expression, thus adding an alternative
mechanism by which PAR-1 contributes to the malignant
phenotype of melanoma.

Lentiviral shRNA to PAR-1 and Cx-43. PAR-1 shRNA (target sequence:
AGATTAGTCTCCATCAATA), Cx-43 shRNA (target sequence: CCATCTTCATCATCTTCAT), and a nontargeting (NT) shRNA (target sequence:
TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) were used with the lentiviral system developed and kindly provided to us by Didier Trono (Ecole Polytechnique
Fédérale de Lausanne) as described previously (7).
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was done as described previously (7).
Western blot analysis. Cx-43 was detected in total cell extracts by 10%
SDS-PAGE as we described previously (7). SP-1 (1:1,000) c-Jun (1:1,000), and
c-Fos (1:1,000) were detected in nuclear extracts by using the Nuclear
Extraction Kit from Panomics as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis was done by using a human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). The microarrays were produced
in the Microarray Core Facility of Codon Bioscience. Total RNA was isolated
from NT shRNA and PAR-1–silenced cells with the Clontech Advantage RTfor-PCR kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The data were
analyzed using the Affymetrix program as described previously (30).
Reporter constructs and luciferase activity assays. The Cx-43
promoter region (-360 to +150) was amplified from C8161 genomic DNA
using the following primers: forward 5¶-GGGGTACCTGTAAGCTACTTTAAAAATTTTAGAC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-GAAGATCTCCTTGGAGGATGAAGTAAAATGAAAAG-3¶. The fragment was digested with KpnI and BglII and
ligated into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis for
SP-1 elements were created by dinucleotide substitutions (italicized) in the
SP-1 binding motif (GGGAGG to GTTAGG) as described previously (31): SP1 (-100) 5¶-GAAAGGCTGGGAGGAGGTAGTTAGGAGGCTGGTAAATGTG-3¶,

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were done using the ChIP-IT Express kit from Active Motif
according to the manufacturers’ protocol. A 345-bp fragment spanning
the 170 to +175 region of the Cx-43 promoter was amplified by PCR using
10 Amol/L of the following primer sequences: 5¶-ACTTTATCCTGATCCCACTGCTGCT-3¶ and 5¶-GAAGTCACGCCAAGTGATTGAACTC-3¶. The reaction mixture was carried out by an initial denaturation at 94jC for 2 min
followed by 37 cycles of denaturation at 94jC for 20 s, annealing at 50jC for
45 s, and extension at 72jC for 1 min. A final elongation step was carried
out at 72jC for 10 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide.
Attachment of melanoma cells to endothelial cells. HUVECs or
HDMECs were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to reach confluency. A
thin overlay of 2% bovine serum albumin was placed in each well and
incubated for 10 h at 37jC to prevent melanoma cell attachment to tissue
culture plate. Then, 5  104 A375SM or C8161 (NT, PAR-1 shRNA, or Cx-43
shRNA) cells were added to each well and incubated overnight at 37jC.
Wells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained with
crystal violet. For experiments using HDMECs, melanoma cells were
identified by green fluorescence protein. Five fields per well were counted
and averaged. Results are presented as average number of cells adhered per
field.
PAR-1 rescue experiments. PAR-1 constructs with a NH2-terminal
prolactin signal peptide and flag tag (kindly provided by Shaun R. Coughlin,
University of California-San Francisco) was combined with nontargetable
PAR-1 coding region (7-bp silent mutations that will not be recognized
by PAR-1 shRNA). The resulting open reading frame insert was then
ligated into the pLVX-DsRed-Monomer-C1 vector (Clontech) replacing the
red protein coding sequence of DsRed and the final rescue lentiviral vector
was obtained. The recombinant lentivirus was produced as described
previously (7).
Immunoprecipitation. C8161 cells were plated on 10 cm plates and
allowed to reach f85% confluency. The wells were washed twice in PBS
and lysed using passive lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1% Triton X-100, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol (pH 7.6)]. Total cell lysate
(500 Ag) was incubated with 1 Ag anti–PAR-1 (ATAP2) or IgG isotype
control at 4jC overnight under rotation. Protein G Plus-agarose beads
(30 AL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to each sample and
incubated at 4jC for 4 h under rotation. Samples were collected by
centrifugation at 7,000  g for 5 min at 4jC and washed twice with TBSTween 20 and once with PBS. Proteins were eluted in 1 SDS gel loading
buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes, and probed with the anti–PAR-1 antibody (Biodesign
International). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (GE) was used
as secondary antibody and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Statistics. The Student’s t test was used to evaluate the data. P values <
0.05 are considered statistically significant.

Results
Identification of Cx-43 as a downstream target gene
of PAR-1. Previously, we have shown that silencing PAR-1 in
metastatic melanoma cells resulted in an inhibition of tumor
growth and metastasis (7). PAR-1 has been shown to regulate the
expression of proangiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial
growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin-8, and
urokinase-type plasminogen activator, thus contributing to melanoma growth and metastasis. To further investigate how PAR-1
contributes to the malignant phenotype, we sought herein to
identify other potential downstream PAR-1 target genes.
A375SM and C8161 metastatic melanoma cell lines are both high
expressors of PAR-1 (8, 12). These cells were stably transduced with
PAR-1 shRNA and NT lentiviral constructs. The NT construct has
no known homology to any human gene. Fluorescence-activated

Regulation of Cx-43 by PAR-1 at the transcriptional level. To
further determine the mechanism by which PAR-1 regulates Cx-43,
the Cx-43 promoter ( 360 to +150) was cloned in front of the
luciferase reporter gene. The luciferase activity driven by the Cx-43
promoter was significantly inhibited by 3- and 2.5-fold (P < 0.001)
by PAR-1 silencing in A375SM and C8161 cell lines compared with
NT-transduced cells, respectively (Fig. 2A and B). These results
indicate a possible transcriptional regulation of Cx-43 by PAR-1.
Promoter analyses revealed four SP-1 binding sites and one AP-1
(c-Fos or c-Jun) binding site within 100 bp of the transcriptional
initiation site (refs. 34, 35; Fig. 3A). Previous studies have shown
that both SP-1 and c-Jun are required for maximal Cx-43 promoter
activity (35, 36). Western blot analyses were done to determine
whether expression levels of these transcription factors were
affected by PAR-1 silencing. No differences in protein expression
for c-Fos, c-Jun, or SP-1 were seen between NT and PAR-1 shRNAtransduced cells (data not shown). Therefore, we determined
whether there was differential binding of these transcription
factors to the Cx-43 promoter in PAR-1 shRNA-transduced
metastatic melanoma cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation

control. As a negative control, only secondary phycoerythrin antibody was
used without adding PAR-1 antibody. C, Western blot of PAR-1–silenced

J software to determine band intensities.

cell sorting analyses were used to determine the levels of PAR-1
expression on the cell surface. Figure 1A and B show a significant
decrease in PAR-1 expression in both cell lines after transduction
(7). These stably silenced PAR-1 melanoma cell lines were subjected
to cDNA microarrays to determine downstream gene targets of
PAR-1. Among the genes that were differentially expressed, Cx-43
was found to be down-regulated by f6-fold in PAR-1–silenced
cells compared with NT-transduced cells. Furthermore, Western
blot analyses revealed an 82% and 72% decrease of Cx-43
expression in both A375SM and C8161, respectively, after PAR-1
silencing (Fig. 1C), thereby validating the results obtained from the
cDNA microarrays.

transcription factors to the promoter of Cx-43 in PAR-1–silenced
cells compared with NT-transduced A375SM and C8161 cell lines
(Fig. 3B-D).
To further establish the link between PAR-1 regulation of Cx-43
expression via SP-1 and AP-1, point mutations in the binding sites
of SP-1 and AP-1 were made in the Cx-43 promoter. Site-directed
mutagenesis for SP-1 elements were created by dinucleotide
substitutions (italicized) in the SP-1 binding motif (GGGAGG to
GTTAGG) as described previously (31). Site-directed mutagenesis
for the AP-1 element was created by single-base-pair mutation
(italicized) in the AP-1 binding motif (TGAGTCA to TGAGCCA) as
described previously (32). These mutants were cloned in front of
the luciferase reporter gene. Figure 4 depicts significant decreases
in luciferase expression driven by the Cx-43 promoter in the NT
shRNA-transduced cells in all mutated SP-1 sites and in the AP-1
site compared with NT cells transfected with nonmutated Cx-43
promoter in A375SM (Fig. 4A) and C8161 (Fig. 4B) cell lines. The
levels of Cx-43 promoter activity in the NT cells were comparable
with PAR-1–silenced cells after mutating the binding sites in both
cell lines. Moreover, the activity of the Cx-43 promoter in PAR-1–
silenced cells (which already have decreased promoter activity
levels) was further decreased in AP-1 and SP-1 mutations
compared with the PAR-1 shRNA cells transfected with the
nonmutated Cx-43 promoter.
Decreased Cx-43 expression after PAR-1 silencing affects
melanoma cell attachment to endothelial cells. Previous studies
have shown that Cx-43 have adhesive properties and can mediate
cell-cell interactions (21, 22). Cx-43 expression has also been shown
to increase attachment of breast cancer cells to the pulmonary
endothelium, thereby augmenting metastasis (23–26). Therefore,
attachment assays were done to determine if decreases in Cx-43
expression, caused by PAR-1 silencing, affects melanoma cell
attachment to HUVECs or HDMECs. Results from the attachment
assays reveal that there is less binding of PAR-1–silenced A375SM
(P < 0.001) and C8161 (P < 0.001) cells to the endothelial cells when
compared with both cell lines transduced with NT shRNA (Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, to determine if this decrease in attachment was

specifically due to the decrease in Cx-43 expression after PAR-1
silencing, Cx-43 was silenced via lentiviral shRNA in A375SM and
C8161 cell lines (Fig. 5B), both of which are high expressors of Cx43. Attachment assays again reveal less binding of Cx-43–silenced
melanoma cells compared with NT-transduced cells (P < 0.001;
Fig. 5C), similar to the results obtained with the PAR-1–silenced cells.
As a further proof-of-principle, PAR-1 was rescued in PAR-1–
silenced C8161 melanoma cell line (Fig. 6A). This results in
increased Cx-43 protein levels similar to that of NT shRNAtransduced melanoma cells (Fig. 6B). Reexpressing PAR-1 also
reverts the decrease seen in melanoma cell attachment to
endothelial cells after PAR-1 silencing (Fig. 6C and D). Furthermore, to ascertain that functional gap junctions were indeed
occurring between melanoma cells and endothelial cells, dye
transfer assays were done, thereby corroborating functional gap
junction formation (Supplementary Fig. S1).
In summary, our results show that silencing PAR-1 decreases
Cx-43 expression. This decrease is mediated via reduced binding
of SP-1 and AP-1 transcription factors to the Cx-43 promoter
after PAR-1 silencing. We further show that decreasing Cx-43, via
both PAR-1 shRNA and Cx-43 shRNA, results in decreased
binding of these cells to endothelial cells, thereby attesting to
the important role PAR-1 plays in tumor cell diapedesis via
regulation of Cx-43.

Discussion
PAR-1 plays a major role in the progression of melanoma. We
and others have shown that PAR-1 is overexpressed in metastatic
melanoma cell lines and tumors compared with nonmetastatic cell
lines and dysplastic nevi (8, 12–14). We, therefore, silenced PAR-1
by using both shRNA and in vivo liposomal delivery of small
interfering RNA and found a significant decrease in both tumor
growth and metastasis, further establishing the central role PAR-1
plays in melanoma progression (7). Interestingly, the addition of
thrombin or hirudin in our studies revealed no differences in the
effects of PAR-1 activity on melanoma cells beyond that of basal
levels probably due to activation of PAR-1 by means other than

thrombin. We cannot exclude the possibility that activation of
PAR-1 in our system could occur in an autocrine manner.
To fully understand how PAR-1 is involved in melanoma growth
and metastasis, we used cDNA microarray profiling on PAR-1–
silenced cells. Based on these results, we have found a link between
PAR-1 expression and the gap junctional intracellular communication molecule, Cx-43, in melanoma. This is the first time that
Cx-43 has been identified to be regulated by PAR-1 in human
melanoma.
The role of Cx-43 in cancer is controversial. Studies have shown
that, in several cancers, Cx-43 acts as a tumor suppressor gene with
loss of Cx-43 contributing to metastasis (37–39). Conversely,
expression of Cx-43 has also been shown to increase tumor
metastasis in breast cancer as well as in gliomas through increased
attachment and communication with the vascular endothelium
(15, 17, 21–26).
Previous studies using murine melanoma cells report increased
coupling of melanoma cells expressing higher levels of Cx-43 to the
vascular endothelial cells (23). In fact, the ability of tumor cells to
metastasize appears to correlate with the ability of tumor cells to
communicate with endothelial cells (24). Nevertheless, studies
analyzing the early steps in melanoma progression found a
decrease in Cx-43 in human melanoma cells (19, 40). Our findings,
however, show high levels of Cx-43 protein expression in metastatic
melanoma cell lines and that loss of PAR-1 expression results in the
loss of Cx-43. Our finding does not support the role of Cx-43 acting

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

as a tumor suppressor gene in malignant melanoma. Its expression
level was high in the metastatic A375SM and C8161 cell lines but
was dramatically reduced in these cells transduced with PAR-1
shRNA. Our data suggest another possible mechanism by which
PAR-1 contributes to invasion and metastasis in melanoma, that is,
by regulating Cx-43.
After identifying Cx-43 as a possible gene target of PAR-1, we
validated our cDNA microarray results to determine if there was
indeed a decrease in Cx-43 protein levels. This validation is
essential, as cDNA microarrays only analyze the mRNA, thereby
necessitating further studies to determine if actual protein levels
are decreased. Therefore, Western blot analyses on both PAR-1–
silenced metastatic melanoma cell lines were done. These studies
revealed a significant decrease in Cx-43 protein levels after PAR-1
silencing, thus confirming that Cx-43 was being regulated by PAR-1
at the protein level. We, therefore, sought to determine the
mechanism by which PAR-1 was affecting Cx-43 expression.
Promoter analyses revealed that the Cx-43 promoter activity was
significantly inhibited by PAR-1 shRNA, suggesting that PAR-1
regulates Cx-43 expression at the transcriptional level.
Based on these results, we determined whether PAR-1 was
affecting the binding of transcription factors that were shown
previously to be required for maximal promoter activity, that is, AP-1
and SP-1 (35, 36). Although PAR-1 did not affect the expression of
these transcription factors, it did affect binding of SP-1, c-Jun,
and c-Fos to the promoter of Cx-43. As both transcription factors

(SP-1 and AP-1) act as positive regulators of Cx-43, our data provide a
novel mechanism for the regulation of Cx-43 expression by PAR-1.
The link between PAR-1 affecting binding of AP-1 and SP-1 to the
Cx-43 promoter was further strengthened by performing mutation
analyses on these transcription factor binding sites and determining the effects on Cx-43 promoter activity after PAR-1 silencing.

less PAR-1 induction of the Cx-43 promoter as seen in the NTtransduced cells (PAR-1 positive) after the transcription factor
binding sites were mutated. Furthermore, the promoter activity in
PAR-1–silenced cells is further decreased after promoter mutagenesis. This allowed us to conclude that the mechanism for the
regulation of Cx-43 by PAR-1 occurs through differential binding of
AP-1 and SP-1 to the promoter of Cx-43.
Previous studies have found that increased Cx-43 levels have an
effect on tumor cell attachment to certain cell types including
endothelial cells (21–26). These studies support our findings showing
that, with decreased Cx-43 expression via PAR-1 shRNA, there was a
significant decrease in melanoma cell attachment to endothelial
cells. To ascertain that the changes seen in attachment of PAR-1–
silenced cells to endothelial cells was truly a result of decreased
Cx-43 expression, lentiviral Cx-43 shRNA was used to silence Cx-43 in
A375SM and C8161 cell lines. As with PAR-1–silenced cells, silencing
of Cx-43 also caused a reduction in binding of melanoma cells to
HUVEC. Further proof that PAR-1 was regulating attachment of
melanoma cells to endothelial cells via Cx-43 was obtained when
PAR-1 was reexpressed in PAR-1–silenced C8161 melanoma cells.
Rescuing PAR-1 resulted in an increase in Cx-43 expression. This
also resulted in an increase of melanoma cell attachment to
endothelial cells compared with PAR-1–silenced cells or control.
HDMECs were used in these experiments to illustrate that these
effects on attachment were also seen in microvessel endothelial
cells and was, therefore, not an artifact of using HUVECs. Finally,
to illustrate that Cx-43 gap junctions are present between
melanoma cells and microvessel endothelial cells, dye transfer
assays were used to show functional gap junction formations
(Supplementary Fig. S1). We, therefore, concluded that attachment of melanoma cells to endothelial cells was in part due to the
expression of Cx-43.
PAR-1 regulation of Cx-43 in melanoma cells might have direct
effects on melanoma metastasis. The ability of tumor cells to
metastasize appears to correlate with the ability of tumor cells to
communicate with endothelial cells (24). The metastatic cascade is
complex and involves expression and silencing of a myriad of genes.
It has been argued that Cx-43 is lost in the early phases of melanoma
progression in which melanocytes, but not melanoma cells, were
able to communicate with keratinocytes through connexins (19, 40).
However, these findings did not include studies on melanoma cells
en route to the metastatic organ. Once melanoma cells have
reached the vasculature, they must arrest and extravasate through
the vascular endothelium in the metastatic organ. In this process
(tumor cell diapedesis), Cx-43 plays an important role in melanoma
progression. Previous studies have found that this increase in Cx-43
is not only crucial for communication between tumor cells and
endothelial cells but also plays a role in tumor cell adherence and
diapedesis (21, 22). Studies have also shown the importance of Cx-43
in enhancing angiogenesis in vivo (41, 42), which correlate with our
previous findings of decreased blood vessel formation and
angiogenesis after treating tumor-bearing mice with liposomaldelivered PAR-1 small interfering RNA (7).
Our data indicate that Cx-43 is not a tumor suppressor gene in
melanoma. Rather, it functions to enhance attachment and
diapedesis of circulating melanoma cells to the vascular endothelium. Moreover, up-regulation of Cx-43 allow for the establishment
of intracellular communication between the tumor microenvironment and the metastatic tumor cells, allowing for the passage
of ions and second messengers, which further enhances the

expression seen in melanoma progression mediates high levels of
Cx-43 expression through increased binding of SP-1 and AP-1
