ABSTRACT
Aminopeptidase
inhibitors are receiving attention as combination
chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
However, the factors determining therapeutic efficacy remain elusive. Here we
identified the molecular basis of acquired resistance to CHR2863, an orally available
hydrophobic aminopeptidase inhibitor prodrug with an esterase-sensitive motif, in
myeloid leukemia cells. CHR2863 enters cells by diffusion and is retained therein
upon esterase activity-mediated conversion to its hydrophilic active metabolite drug
CHR6768, thereby exerting amino acid depletion. Carboxylesterases (CES) serve
as candidate prodrug activating enzymes given CES1 expression in acute myeloid
leukemia specimens. We established two novel myeloid leukemia sublines U937/
CHR2863(200) and U937/CHR2863(5uM), with low (14-fold) and high level (270fold) CHR2863 resistance. The latter drug resistant cells displayed: (i) complete loss
of CES1-mediated drug activation associated with down-regulation of CES1 mRNA and
protein, (ii) marked retention/sequestration of the prodrug, (iii) a substantial increase
in intracellular lipid droplets, and (iv) a dominant activation of the pro-survival Akt/

mTOR pathway. Remarkably, the latter feature coincided with a gain of sensitivity
to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These finding delineate the molecular basis of
CHR2863 resistance and offer a novel modality to overcome this drug resistance in
myeloid leukemia cells.

INTRODUCTION

of carboxylesterase-1 and its association with lipid
droplets, prodrug sequestration and lack of conversion to
its active metabolite, and activation of ERK/Akt/mTOR
pro-survival pathways. We further show that the latter
could be exploited to efficiently overcome CHR2863 drug
resistance using mTOR-targeted drugs like rapamycin.

Aminopeptidases (AP) play an essential role in
protein and peptide homeostasis by regulating their
modification, maturation, activation and degradation [1].
Small peptides may either be completely hydrolyzed to
amino acids for renewed protein biosynthesis or trimmed
for major histocompatibility class I presentation to initiate
CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses [2]. Moreover,
plasma membrane-associated APs such as aminopeptidase
N (CD13) can serve as cell function mediators, e.g. in
signal transduction pathways in immune cells [3, 4] or
endothelial cells [5]. Consequently, the relevance of APs
extends to malignant and (chronic) inflammatory diseases
[6-9] and may thus provide opportunities for therapeutic
interventions [10]. In this context, bestatin represented the
first prototypic AP-inhibitor tested in the clinical setting
and displayed immune-modulatory properties through
suppression of the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines by activated macrophages [11] as well as
anti-proliferative activity in lung cancer [12] and acute
myeloid leukemia [13]. Building on bestatin as a direct AP
inhibitor, prodrug versions of AP-inhibitors are currently
being evaluated, of which Tosedostat (CHR2797) [14]
displayed promising clinical activity against acute myeloid
leukemia [15-17], multiple myeloma [18] and solid tumors
[19;20]. As a hydrophobic prodrug Tosedostat harbors a
cyclopentyl ester that requires intracellular cleavage by
(carboxyl) esterase activity [21] to yield a hydrophilic
acid form that enhances its intracellular retention. Since
carboxylesterases are highly expressed in myelomonocytic
leukemia cells [22], this may underlie Tosedostat’s activity
towards AML. Tosedostat blocks multiple APs, including
aminopeptidase N (CD13), leucine aminopeptidase and
puromycin-specific aminopeptidase [14]. These inhibitory
activities were mediated by its conversion to its active
metabolite, while the latter displayed a potent inhibitory
activity against leukotriene A4 hydrolase [14]. Upon AP
inhibition, Tosedostat provoked an intracellular amino
acid depletion and suppressed cell growth as part of an
amino acid deprivation response as well as inhibition of
mTOR [14, 23].
As AP prodrugs with esterase motifs are being
evaluated in the clinic, we herein addressed the important
question as to whether prolonged exposure to these classes
of drug would provoke the onset of drug resistance, and
if so, elucidate the molecular basis of this drug resistance.
We report that human myelomonocytic U937 cells
acquired resistance to CHR2863, an orally available
close structural analogue of Tosedostat/CHR2797, via
multifactorial mechanisms involving down-regulation

RESULTS
Development of CHR2863 resistance and crossresistance profile
CHR2863, a close structural analogue of
Tosedostat (CHR2797) with a methoxy-group in the
hydroxycarbamoyl moiety (Fig. 1A) was administered
to human myelomonocytic U937 cells in gradually
(stepwise) increasing concentrations over a period of
4-6 months. During this multiple step selection U937
cells acquired resistance to CHR2863 (Fig. 1B) and two
sublines were isolated for further characterization; one
with a low level resistance grown at a concentration of
200 nM CHR2863 (U937/CHR2863(200)) and another
with a high level resistance grown at a concentration of
5µM CHR2863 (U937/CHR2863(5µM)). Dose response
curves for CHR2863-induced growth inhibition in parental
U937/WT cells and the two sublines are shown in Figure
1C. Resistance factors were found to be 13.7-fold and
as high as 270-fold for U937/CHR2863(200) and U937/
CHR2863(5µM) cells, respectively (Table 1).
Cross-resistance profiling for other selected (pro)
drugs (Table 1) showed lack of cross-resistance to
the direct AP-inhibitor bestatin and CHR5346 (a noncleavable analogue of CHR2797), suggesting that
alterations in AP-levels do not contribute to CHR2863
resistance. CHR2863-resistant cells also retained
sensitivity to CHR2875, an HDAC-inhibitor prodrug
[21]. Interestingly, CHR2863-resistant cells displayed a
collateral hypersensitivity of 2-3 fold to the topoisomerase
inhibitor prodrug CPT-11/irinotecan, but were 2-fold less
sensitive to the 5-fluorouracil prodrug Capecitabine/
Xeloda. CHR2863-resistant cells retained sensitivity to
cytarabine and daunorubicin, two drugs which are usually
combined with Tosedostat/CHR2797 in AML therapy
[15]. Finally, growth inhibitory effects of two proteasome
inhibitors Bortezomib (Velcade) and carfilzomib [24],
functioning upstream of APs in protein degradation
pathways, were unaltered in CHR2863-resistant cells.
Examination of the stability of the drug resistance
phenotype revealed that in the absence of the selecting

Intracellular sequestration CHR2863 and lack of
its conversion to the active metabolite in U937/
CHR2863(5µM) cells

drug, U937/CHR2863(200) cells rapidly lost (within 1
month) their CHR2863 resistance. In contrast, U937/
CHR2863(5µM) cells retained their drug resistance
phenotype in the absence of CHR2863 for > 3 months,
thereby establishing a genetically stable resistance
phenotype (Supplementary Figure S1).
As an initial approach to unravel the molecular
basis underlying CHR2863 resistance, we explored
whether drug extrusion via multidrug resistance (MDR)related drug efflux transporters [25] could be involved as
they can extrude a broad spectrum of hydrophobic drugs
(e.g. CHR2863) or hydrophilic drugs (e.g. CHR6768,
the acid form of CHR2863). Western blot analysis of
a series of drug efflux transporters revealed either no
detectable expression of these MDR efflux transporters
(P-glycoprotein, MRP2 and MRP3) or no differential
expression (MRP1, MRP5 and BCRP) in U937/WT and
a series of CHR2863-resistant U937 cells (Supplementary
Figure S2). Of note, expression of MRP4 was gradually
increased in U937 cells with increasing levels of CHR2863
resistance. Elevated levels of MRP4 were, however,
not directly accountable for CHR2863 resistance as coincubation with an established inhibitor of MRP4 (i.e.
MK571) had no reversal effect on CHR2863 resistance
(results not shown). Together, these results and crossresistance profiling point to a non-classical mechanism of
CHR2863 resistance.

Since conversion of CHR2863 to the hydrophilic
acid metabolite CHR6768 is essential for its
pharmacological activity, we determined this capacity
in U937/WT and U937/CHR2863 cells. U937/WT
displayed a proficient and linear (not shown) conversion
of CHR2863 into CH6768 (338 ± 63 ng/106 cells) over
a 6 hr exposure to 6 µM CHR2863 (Figure 2A). Under
these conditions, U937/CHR2863(200) cells displayed
a 24% reduced conversion to CHR6768 (251 ± 47 ng
drug/106 cells) as compared to U937/WT cells. Strikingly,
however, conversion of CHR2863 to CHR6768 in
U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells was essentially completely
abolished (7.3 ± 2.2 ng drug/106 cells, thereby losing
98% of parental U937/WT enzymatic conversion
capacity. Additionally, beyond the conversion to the
active metabolites, we also determined the levels of
the CHR2863 prodrug retained in these three myeloid
leukemia cell lines (Figure 2B). In U937/WT and U937/
CHR2863(200) cells, absolute intracellular levels of
CHR2863 were 3 orders of magnitude lower than those
of CHR6768, being 0.27 ± 0.07 ng CHR2863 /106 cells
and 0.12 ± 0.05 ng CHR2863/106 cells), respectively.
Remarkably, U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells retained
significantly higher levels (8-17 fold) of prodrug (2.0 ±
0.8 ng CHR2863/106 cells) compared to U937/WT and
U937/CHR2863(200) cells, thus suggesting sequestration

of the prodrug in these cells and evasion from conversion
to CHR6768.
As a comparison we determined the cellular levels
of the HDAC prodrug inhibitor CHR2875 and its active
metabolite CHR2880 after 6 hours of exposure to 6 µM
CHR2875. Of note, absolute levels of CHR2880 were
approximately 100-fold lower than for CHR6768, but
no significant differences in levels of CHR2875 and
CHR2880, respectively, were observed for U937/WT (0.43
± 0.18 and 3.6 ± 0.2 ng/106 cells), U937/CHR2863(200)

cells (0.55 ± 0.15 and 3.0 ± 1.6 ng/106 cells) and U937/
CHR2863(5µM) cells (0.66 ± 0.05 and 4.3 ± 2.5 ng/106
cells), being consistent with a comparable drug sensitivity
profile between the parent and drug resistant sublines
shown in Table 1.
These results indicate that at least for U937/
CHR2863(5µM) cells, CHR2863 resistance is associated
with intracellular drug sequestration along with a markedly
impaired conversion to its acid metabolite CHR6768.

Carboxylesterase expression in myeloid leukemia
cells

CES2 expression was not detectable by Western blot
analysis of AML cells as compared to HepG2 hepatoma
cells serving as a positive control (data not shown).

Since carboxylesterases have an established and
prominent role as drug metabolizing enzymes [21, 26-28],
we examined the expression levels of two of its family
members; carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and carboxylesterase
2 (CES2), in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood cells
of AML patients at diagnosis. Consistent with gene
expression profiling data of AML blasts cells [22] we
observed differential expression of CES1 being more
prominent in (myelo) monocytic M4 and M5 FAB
classification subtypes than other subtypes (Figure 3A). Of
note, CES1 expression was consistently high in matched
peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of M5 patients.

Down-regulation of CES1 and upregulation of
CES2 in U937/CHR2863 cells
We next examined whether CES1 and/or CES2 were
involved in CHR2863 conversion and drug resistance.
Analysis of CES1 and CES2 mRNA levels in U937/
CHR2863 cells showed a remarkable down-regulation
of CES1 (3-5 fold), being mirrored by an up-regulation
of CES2 mRNA (Figure 3B). Interestingly, when U937/
CHR2863(1µM) cells were grown in drug-free medium
for 2 weeks, this normalized CES1 and CES2 mRNA to

cells. A. CES1 expression (Western blot) in FAB sub-classified (M0, M1, M2, M4, M5) acute myeloid leukemia cells at diagnosis.

U937/WT levels, but a rechallenge with 1 µM CHR2863
reinforced down-regulation of CES1 and up-regulation
of CES2 mRNA (Figure 3B). To understand whether
these dynamics were resistance-induced or could also be
noted after pulse exposure (0-6 hrs) to CHR2863, U937/
WT cells were exposed to either 50 nM CHR2863 (IC50
concentration) or 6 µM CHR2863 (used for metabolite
conversion experiments). Both conditions induced CES1
mRNA down-regulation (up to 3-fold) and a comparable
up-regulation of CES2 mRNA (Supplementary Figure
S3A/B). Since U937/CHR2863(200nM) and U937/
CHR2863(5µM) cells were already down-regulated in
CES1 and up-regulated in CES2 mRNA expression, pulse
exposure to 6 µM CHR2863 only modestly increased
this differential or had no additional effect, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S3C/D).
We next examined whether differences in CES1
and CES2 mRNA were also reflected at the protein level.
CES1 protein levels were not significantly altered in
U937/CHR2863(200nM) compared to U937/WT cells,
but U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells displayed a markedly
down-regulated CES1 expression (Figure 3C). Rather,
CES2 protein expression was modestly increased in both

CHR2863-resistant cells compared to U937/WT cells,
whereas expression of another CES homologue, CES3,
was unaltered (Figure 3C).
CES1 knockdown by using CES1 siRNA was
performed in U937/WT cells which resulted in 85%
reduction of CES1 mRNA expression and a 35% reduced
conversion of CHR2863 to its active metabolite in U937/
WT controls. This reduction, however, had no significant
impact on growth inhibitory effects of CHR2863 (not
shown), suggesting that knock down of CES1 did not
reach a critical level to fully impair CHR2863 conversion
and thereby confer resistance. Together, these studies
indicate that CHR2863 induces differential response
in CES1 and CES2 expression which, upon prolonged
exposure, may contribute to acquisition of CHR2863
resistance.

CES1 association with lipid droplets
Several studies have pointed out that the catalytic
activity of CES1 is enhanced upon hydrophobic
interactions with lipid droplets, which are cell organelles

Increased number of lipid droplets in U937/
CHR2863 cells

involved in neutral lipid (triglyceride and sterolester)
storage [29-31]. Lipid droplets have also been reported
in U937 cells and recognized for a role in cancer and
inflammatory processes [32, 33]. Given this hydrophobic
compartment association with CES1, lipid droplets may
deserve consideration as a possible site of sequestration
of non-metabolized hydrophobic CHR2863 as in U937/
CHR2863(5µM) cells (Figure 2B). Staining of intracellular
lipids within lipid bodies by Nile Red and visualization by
3D digital imaging fluorescence microscopy is shown in
Figure 4A, demonstrating the variability in numbers and
sizes of lipid droplets in U937/WT cells. Additionally, we
examined whether CES1 co-localized with lipid droplets,
which proved to be the case (Figure 4A, merged figure
and inset).
The data for CES1 protein expression (Figure 3C)
in U937/WT and CHR2863-resistant cells were further
corroborated by live cell 3D digital imaging microscopy
revealing a markedly decreased expression of CES1 in
U937/CHR2863(200) cells and a dramatic loss of CES1
expression in U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells, comparable
to those in CES1-negative KG1 cells [21] (Figure 4B).
Moreover, 3D digital live cell imaging microscopy also
showed a rapid decrease in CES1 immunoreactivity in
parental U937/WT cells after 6hr pulse exposure to 6 µM
CHR2863 (Figure 4B). Since this pulse exposure had
no effect on CES1 protein levels analyzed by Western
blotting (data not shown), this points to CHR2863induced conformational alterations or post-translational
modifications in CES1 which impair antibody binding to
the enzyme in its native state.

Quantification of lipid droplet numbers in U937/
WT and CHR2863-resistant cells was undertaken using
live stream imaging analysis on Nile Red-stained cells
with subsequent sorting of cells based on lipid droplet
numbers per cell (Figure 5A). A representative distribution
profile is depicted in Figure 5B, indicating that mean lipid
droplet counts in U937/WT cells (2.1/cell) increased
by 40% - 50% in U937/CHR2863(200) cells (3.2/ cell)
and U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells (2.9/cell). The presence
of lipid droplets in U937/WT and CHR2863-resistant
cells was further confirmed by transmission electron
microscopy (Supplementary Figure S4), which also
indicated close physical contact of lipid droplets with
mitochondria (Supplementary Figure S4C, subsection A8
and A9). These studies indicate that CHR2863 resistance
is associated with increased lipid droplets content in
CHR2863 resistant cells.

Altered cholesterol homeostasis in CHR2863resistant U937 cells
Beyond a pharmacologic function of CES1 in
drug metabolism, the enzyme is also physiologically
implicated in cholesterol homeostasis by regulating the
hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol [30,
34]. To explore whether the marked down- regulation
of CES1 in U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells had an impact
on cellular cholesteryl ester and free cholesterol content,
these parameters were followed during 1-3 day cell growth
(Supplementary Figure S5). After one day in culture,
U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells had significantly higher levels

(as in (A)). Mean of two separate experiments performed in duplicate. All experiments included 0.06% DMSO solvent controls.

of cholesteryl esters as compared to U937/WT cells. Upon
prolonged cell growth, cholesteryl ester levels in U937/
CHR2863(5µM) were normalized to those of U937/WT
and U937/CHR2863(200) cells.
Collectively, these studies indicate that CHR2863
induces a differential response in CES1 and CES2
expression which, upon prolonged exposure, may
contribute to acquisition of CHR2863 resistance and also
impact cellular cholesterol homeostasis.

that CHR2863-resistant cells had similar levels of [14C]arginine transport capacity as U937/WT cells and also
did not show evidence (based on lack of LC3B cleavage)
of autophagy induction as compensatory mechanism.
Western blot analysis (Figure 6A) revealed increased
ratios of phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) and phosphorylated
mTOR over total Akt and mTOR in resistant cells
compared to parental cells, pointing to the activation of
the Akt/mTOR pathway in CHR2863-resistant cells.
Akt activation was further indicated by a diminished
sensitivity to the Akt inhibitor Perifosine (Supplementary
Figure S6). A role for mTOR activation in CHR2863resistant cells was confirmed by a marked gain in the
sensitivity to rapamycin (Figure 6B); whereas U937/WT
cells were relatively insensitive to growth inhibition by
rapamycin (IC50: 2260 ± 960 nM), U937/CHR2863(200)
cells displayed 54-fold increased sensitivity to rapamycin
(IC50: 42 ± 38 nM). Rapamycin sensitivity was further
enhanced (>1,000-fold) in U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells
(IC50: 0.56 ± 0.41 nM). Notably, rapamycin sensitization
in U937/WT cells could be induced by co-incubations
with non-toxic concentrations of either the dual PI3K/

Activation of Erk/Akt/mTOR pathway in U937/
CHR2863 cells and marked gain rapamycin
sensitivity
Previous studies by Krige et al [14] showed that the
AP inhibitors induce an acute response of an intracellular
amino acid deprivation leading to repression of mTOR
activity as a master facilitator of protein synthesis [35]. We
explored how CHR2863-resistant U937 cells overcame
these initial responses by examining the phosphorylation
status of mTOR and Akt as indicators of a pro-survival
signal. Earlier experiments (not shown) demonstrated

mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 [36-39] or the Akt inhibitor
MK2206 [40] (Figure 6C). Thus, conceivably, the marked
gain in sensitivity to rapamycin may point to the common
activation of Akt/mTOR pathway in myeloid leukemia
cells [41]. Mechanistically, recent observations by BarPeled et al [42] revealed that inactivating mutations in
the DEPDC5 subunit of the GATOR1-mTOR inhibitory
complex conferred mTOR hyperactivation and marked
gain in sensitivity to rapamycin. We therefore examined
whether DEPDC5 mutation could explain the marked
gain of rapamycin sensitivity in CHR2863 resistant

cells. However, no DEPDC5 mutations were identified
in CHR2816-resistant cells (not shown). Together,
these studies indicate that activation of Akt/mTOR can
overcome the amino acid deprivation effects conveyed by
AP-inhibitor drugs such as CHR2863.
A composite summary model that accommodates
all altered parameters contributing to the CHR2863 drug
resistance phenotype is presented and discussed in Figure
7.

Figure 7: Composite model depicting mechanism of action of CHR2863 sensitivity in U937 cells (left) and mechanism
of acquired resistance to CHR2863 in U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells (right). Parts of the (poly)peptides produced by proteasome-

mediated protein degradation are processed for MHC class I presentation involving ERAP (ER-associated aminopeptidase). It is unknown
whether CHR2863 or CHR6768 exert inhibitory effects on ERAP. Most polypeptides will be subject to full degradation to amino acids,
involving aminopeptidase (AP) action, for renewed protein synthesis. Due to its hydrophobic nature, the cyclopentyl-ester conjugated
compound CHR2863 can freely diffuse into cells and has potential to inhibit several APs [14]. The AP-inhibitory potency, however,
is significantly improved upon conversion of CHR2863 to its acid metabolite CHR6768 which is accumulated and retained in cells. A
likely candidate for CHR2863 conversion includes carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), which has a physiologic function in regulating cholesterol
homeostasis, in particular in lipid droplet (LD) cell organelles. Conceivably, CES1 associated with LDs may provide a microenvironment
that promotes CHR2863 conversion. CHR6768-induced inhibition of multiple APs will provoke an amino acid depletion which is sensed by
mTOR leading to suppression of protein synthesis and inhibition of cell growth. In CHR2863-resistant cells, at least two adaptations took
place. One involves a marked down-regulation of CES1 which may convey two effects; (i) rather than conversion, CHR2863 is sequestered
in LD. Concomitantly, increased cholesteryl esters in LD may act as cell proliferation regulator, and (ii) loss of CHR6768-induced AP
inhibition relieves part of the amino acid deprivation pressure, which could contribute to reactivation of mTOR activity. Second, mTOR
reactivation may also be initiated separate from CES1 down-regulation (as in U937/CHR2863(200) cells) to promote protein synthesis and
cell growth consistent with a resistant phenotype. This is achieved by Erk activation, as an early response in low resistant cells, and Akt/
mTOR activation. Activation of mTOR in CHR2863-resistant cells is a targetable entity for its inhibitor rapamycin.

DISCUSSION

hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol. Studies
by Zhao et al [49] showed that stable over expression of
CES1 in human macrophage THP1 cells promoted the
extrusion of free cholesterol. Conversely, pharmacologic
inhibition of CES1 induced cholesteryl ester retention
[34], whereas shRNA-dependent CES1 knockdown in
THP1 cells was accompanied by compensatory CES3
upregulation to sustain cholesteryl ester hydrolytic
activity [50]. Moreover, the same study demonstrated
that CES3 transfection decreased the numbers of lipid
droplets in THP1 cells. Our data (including Supplementary
Figure S5) are consistent with these observations, except
that upregulation of CES2 rather than CES3 in U937/
CHR2863 cells may serve as a compensatory mechanism
in cholesterol homeostasis. In this context recent studies
pointed to the role of increased cholesterol ester levels
as growth regulators in leukemia cells [51]. Whether
increased cholesterol ester levels in CHR2863-resistant
cells indeed contribute to the resistant phenotype deserves
further studies. Lastly, EM studies indicating that in
CHR2863-resistant cells lipid droplets had physical
contacts with mitochondria (Suppl. Fig S4B) implying
that lipolytic activity within lipid droplets and the release
of free fatty acid for β-oxidation in mitochondria holds
relevance for energy transfer [52].
Direct evidence for CHR2863 sequestration in
subcellular compartments such as lipid droplets is limited
by subcellular fractionation techniques that would retain
low quantities of CHR2863 hydrophobic prodrug per cell
(Fig. 2B). Nonetheless, several lines of indirect evidence
point to the plausible role of lipid droplets in the CHR2863
resistance phenotype. Conceivably, given the dominant
hydrophobicity of CHR2863, CES1 surrounding lipid
droplets would provide a more optimal microenvironment
for interaction and hydrolysis of this CHR2863
prodrug than the water soluble cytoplasm [30]. Downregulation of CES1 expression and impaired hydrolysis
of CHR2863 would then drive its marked accumulation
and sequestration in lipid droplets. In analogy, CHR2863
induced swelling of malaria digestive vacuoles [53],
which are known to harbor lipid droplets [54, 55]. Apart
from their established role in cholesterol ester storage,
lipid droplets have also been recognized as sites of
arachidonic acid metabolism leading to the production
of leukotrienes and prostaglandins, both mediating
inflammatory processes [32, 56]. In this regard, it is
worthwhile to note that the active metabolite of Tosedostat
displayed potent inhibitory effect on leukotriene A4
hydrolase activity (IC50: >10,000 nM for prodrug vs
8 nM for the active metabolite). Indications that the
development of CHR2863-resistance was accompanied
by alterations in arachidonic acid metabolism could
be consistent with observations that U937/CHR2863
cells upregulated the expression of the MDR efflux
transporter MRP4 (Suppl. Fig S2), the function of which
has been reported in intracellular vesicles of U937

Resistance modalities often disclose the Achilles
heel of drug resistant cancer cells thereby offering
a therapeutic avenue to overcome well defined
chemoresistance phenotype [43-47]. The current study
constitutes the first report aimed at unraveling the
molecular basis of resistance to CHR2863. CHR2863
is an aminopeptidase inhibitor prodrug that structurally
mimics the aminopeptidase inhibitor Tostedostat, which
shows promising activities in AML treatment [15].
CHR2863 is a hydrophobic prodrug with an esterase
motif rationally designed to be membrane permeable
and is activated intracellularly via an esterase-dependent
activity that converts it to the active hydrophilic congener
CHR6768 which targets multiple aminopeptidases. Here,
we demonstrate that acquired resistance to CHR2863 is
a multifactorial mechanism including down-regulation
of CES1 expression, impaired prodrug conversion with
intracellular sequestration presumably in lipid droplets,
and activation of the pro-survival ERK/Akt/mTOR
pathway.
Carboxylesterases (CES) play a pivotal role in
intracellular metabolic processes of drug detoxification or
bioactivation as well as lipid/cholesterol homeostasis [26,
27, 30]. The role of CES1 in CHR2863 resistance was most
evident in the highly resistant U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells
where both a marked down-regulation of CES1 mRNA
and CES1 protein were associated with impaired prodrug
conversion. However, for low level CHR2863 resistant
U937/CHR2863(200) cells, down-regulation of CES1
mRNA was not accompanied by similarly reduced CES1
protein levels, albeit a ≈ 25% reduction was observed in
conversion of CHR2863 to CHR6768 compared to U937/
WT cells. This suggests that additional factors contribute
to regulation of CES1 protein and catalytic activity at
low resistance levels versus highly resistant cells. In
this respect, it should be taken into account that within a
window of selective concentrations of 0.2 to 5µM, even
CHR2863 as a prodrug, in analogy with CHR2797 [14],
would impose increasing inhibitory pressure on multiple
APs, thus calling for additional modalities to neutralize
these deleterious effects. In macrophages, redistribution
of CES1 from the cytoplasm to lipid droplets has been
reported in response to lipid loading [48]. It is noteworthy
that in response to down-regulation of CES1, CES2 was
upregulated, probably as a compensatory mechanism.
Since upregulation of CES2 had no pharmacologic impact
on CHR2863 conversion in U937/CHR2863(5µM) cells,
this would imply that CHR2863 is a poor substrate for
CES2 and cannot facilitate sufficient conversion to
CHR2863 to compensate for CES1 down-regulation.
Rather than displaying pharmacological functions,
CES2 upregulation may be a physiologic compensatory
mechanism preserving some essential cellular functions,
in particular in relation to cholesterol homeostasis, i.e.

cells as a facilitator of leukotreine B4, leukotriene C4
[57] as well as prostaglandin E2 [58] extrusion. These
considerations come on top of other functions of lipid
droplets unrelated to lipid metabolism [31, 59-61],
including protein trafficking, temporary sequestration
of proteins and handling proteins prone for destruction,
the latter of which may be of relevance in CHR2863
targeting the proteasome/ aminopeptidase pathway of
protein degradation. In these functions, lipid droplets act
in a dynamic fashion by organizing transient association
with other cellular organelles as endoplasmic reticulum,
mitochondria, endosomes as well as the cytoskeleton.
Studies by Krige et al [14] showed that although
CHR2797 (Tosedostat) prodrug conversion is a critical step
in exerting its pharmacological effect, equally important is
whether or not target cells had the capacity to overcome
the induction of an amino acid deprivation response
and consequent suppression of mTOR activity [62]. In
other words, cells with efficient prodrug conversion but
a proficient amino acid deprivation response, displayed
reduced drug sensitivities. This condition may be
mimicked by U937/CHR2863(200) cells which had
70% residual conversion of CHR2863 to CHR6768
compared to parental U937/WT cells, but acquired a low
level of CHR2863 resistance due to reactivation of Akt/
mTOR. Beyond Akt/mTOR, in U937/CHR2863(200)
cells ERK activation was also noted as a transient
early pro-survival response, which was not retained in
U937/CHR2863(5uM) cells. Akt/mTOR activation in
combination with impaired CHR2863 prodrug conversion
elicited a high level of resistance in U937/CHR2863(5µM)
cells. It is intriguing to note that these phenotypes could
be efficiently monitored by assessment of sensitivity to
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin [63, 64]. Whereas U937/
WT cells were relatively insensitive to rapamycin [65],
U937/CHR2863(200) cells and U937/CHR2863(5µM)
cells already gained a substantial increase in rapamycinsensitivity at clinically relevant concentrations of 10 nM;
this novel finding has major therapeutic implications for
the overcoming of CHR2863 resistance in the clinical
setting. Mechanistically, the increased sensitivity to
inhibition of an overactivated pathway such as Akt/
mTOR is compatible with the ‘dam model’ as proposed
for overactivated pro-survival pathways such as BCRABL fusion [66]. This upstream survival anti-apoptotic
mechanism has no downstream anti-apoptotic backing.
Hence, upon pharmacologic inhibition of the overactivated
and uncontrolled dam kinase like BCR-ABL, cells become
extremely sensitized and hence collapse and die as the
dam is gone.
Collectively, a multifactorial mechanism appears
to underlie acquired resistance to CHR2863 that includes
loss of CES1 expression, lack of prodrug conversion, drug
sequestration as well as Akt/mTOR activation.
It is a recurrent theme whether mechanisms of
drug resistance observed in model systems will also be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

operative in a clinical setting. For the treatment of myeloid
leukemia, CHR2797 (Tosedostat) is not administered
as single agent but usually in combination with other
chemotherapeutics, i.e. daunorubicin and cytarabine
[15], for which CHR2863-resistant U937 myeloid cells
retained activity (Table 1). Interestingly, the current study
raised some additional potential combinations that may
merit further exploration. One would be a combination
of CHR2863 with CPT-11/irinotecan which showed
collateral sensitivity in CHR2863-resistant U937 cells
(Table 1). This is likely attributable to the increased
expression of CES2 which facilitates activation of CPT11 [27, 28, 67, 68]. This combination may not only be
effective in CHR2863-resistant myeloid cells, but to
previously unexposed cells as CES2 upregulation was
also noted after short term CHR2863 exposure (Suppl.
Fig. S3A/B). Notably, the role of CES2 in collateral
sensitivity to CPT-11 in CHR2863-resistant cells was
confirmed by the fact that pharmacologic inhibitors of
CES2, e.g. loperamide and benzil [69] abrogated this
sensitizing effect (not shown). The opposite response in
CES1 and CES2 expression upon CHR2863 exposure may
neutralize a potential combination effects for capecitabine
as this 5-FU prodrug can be activated by both esterases
[70, 71]. Last but not least, the dramatic gain of sensitivity
to rapamycin in U937/CHR2863 cells strongly calls for
further examination of combinations of aminopeptidase
inhibitor (pro)drugs and rapamycin or other rapalogs. As
such, the expanded knowledge of mechanisms underlying
loss of efficacy to aminopeptidase inhibitors may guide
more rationalized applications of this type of drugs
as single agent or in combination therapies, in order to
achieve improved therapeutic targeting of monocytes/
macrophages in either a cancer or (chronic) inflammatory
disease setting.

Cell culture and development of CHR2863
resistance
The human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line
U937 (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) was grown in
RPMI-1640 culture medium (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium)
supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, PAA Cell
Culture Company, Pasching, Austria), 20 mM HEPES, 2
mM L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin
(all from Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). Cells were cultured
in 25cm2 culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One GmbH,
Frickenhansen, Germany) in 10 ml medium at an initial
density of 3 x 105 cells/ml and in a humidified atmosphere
at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cell cultures were refreshed every
3-4 days.
Acquired resistance to CHR2863 was induced by
exposing U937/WT cells to a starting concentration of 15
nM CHR2863 (IC10) for one week. Then, the concentration
of CHR2863 was gradually stepwise increased when
cells had adapted to drug increments by exhibiting cell
growth comparable to control U937/WT cells. Over the
course of CHR2863 increments, two sublines of CHR2863
resistant U937 cells were selected for further detailed
characterization; (a) one with a relatively low level of
acquired resistance (≈ 14-fold) isolated after 2.5 months
when grown in the presence of 200 nM CHR2863 (further
designated as U937/CHR2863(200), and (b) another with
a high level of CHR2863 resistance (> 250-fold) isolated
after 5-6 months when grown in the presence of 5 µM
CHR2863 (further designated as U937/CHR2863(5µM)
cells).

Western blotting

Extraction of total RNA from 1-2 x 106 cells was
performed with Trizol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according
to manufacturers. For cDNA synthesis, the DyNAmo
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) was used as follows: 500 ng RNA were diluted in
RNase-free water to a total volume of 7 µl and mixed with
10 µl RT buffer (containing 10 mM MgCl2 and a dNTP
mix), 1 µl of random hexamers (300 ng/µl) and 2 µl of
M-MuLV RNase H+ reverse transcriptase (RT). PCR was
performed under the following conditions: 10 min at 25°C
for primer extension, 30 min at 37°C for cDNA synthesis
and 5 min at 85°C to terminate the reaction (inactivation
of M-MuLV). The samples were stored at -20°C until use.
qRT-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA
expression levels of CES1 and CES2. cDNA was diluted
1:10 by adding 180 µl of RNase-free water to the sample
volume of 20µl. For a duplicate reaction, 29.5 µl of the
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA), 15.5 µl RNase-free water and 2.5
µl probed primers (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays

CT values. A validation experiment was performed to
demonstrate that the efficiencies of the target (CES1 and
CES2) and reference (β-actin) gene amplifications were
approximately equal, using a standard curve method with
several dilutions (from 1:10 to 1:10000) of a cDNA sample
from untreated control cells. The results were analyzed
using the ΔΔCt method, where Ct values are normalized

PIC (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and 1 mM NaVO4. After
centrifugation (13,000 x g for 10 min), protein content in
the supernatant fraction was determined using the Bio-Rad
Protein Assay (Munich, Germany). Protein aliquots (30
μg) of cell lysates were fractionated on a 4-20% TGX precast SDS PAGE gel (BioRad) and next transferred onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) suitable for the Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Zaventem, Belgium) for
chemoluminescent detection. The membranes were preincubated for 1 hour in blocking buffer (Odyssey Blocking
Buffer, LI-COR, Biosciences) or PBST (PBS and 0.05%
Tween20, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) containing 5%
non-fat dry milk (Biorad, Munich, Germany). After
blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at
4oC with specific primary antibodies. β-Actin was used as
the control for equal loading. After 3 washing steps with
PBS/0.05% Tween20 (Merck, Germany), the membranes
were incubated for 1 hour with appropriate secondary
antibodies. Detection of antibody binding was obtained
using the LI-COR Odyssey scanner (Biosciences)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions, or incubated
for 5 min with the ECL Plus detection solution (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and exposed to an

Intracellular conversion of CHR2863 to its acid
form and active metabolite CHR6768 was analyzed by
incubating 1.5 x 106 U937/WT and U937/CHR2863 cells
(in the absence of selecting drug) in a 25 cm2 tissue culture
flask in 5 ml RPMI-1640 medium/5% FCS at 37°C in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 24 hours, cells
were exposed for 6 hours to 6 µM CHR2863 (unless
otherwise indicated). Cells were then centrifuged and
500 µl of supernatant conditioned medium collected and
stored at -80oC. Cells were then washed twice with 7.5 ml

A similar procedure was followed for the assessment of
the conversion of the HDAC-inhibitor prodrug CHR2875
to CHR2880 [21]. CHR2863 and CHR2875 and their
primary active metabolites were determined by a validated
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric assay,
essentially as described by Krige et al [14]. Briefly, frozen
cell pellets were allowed to warm to room temperature
before being re-suspended in minimal volume of purified
water. The subsequent homogenous suspension was
diluted with water to achieve 5.0 x 106 cells/ml, prior to
being snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Following re-thawing
100 µl of the homogenized cell suspension was extracted
with 40 µl of acetonitrile containing 250 µg/ml BB-1090
(internal standard). After 10 minutes ultra-sonication
and centrifugation (for 2 min, at 10 000 g) 50 µl of the
supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate for LCMS/
MS analysis.
Optimized liquid chromatography was performed on
a 4 µm C18 Hyperclone column (Phenomenex, 50 x 2 mm)
with gradient elution over 4 min at a flow rate of 250 µl/
min. Initial conditions consisted of 85% A (aqueous 0.1%
formic acid) and 15 % B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile),
changing to 15% A: 85% B after 1 min and subsequently
holding for a further 3 min. Mass spectroscopic detection
was performed at optimized conditions as follows; Ion
spray voltage - 3800 volt, Capillary temperature 420°C,
nebulizer gas - 10 litres per min, auxiliary gas - 6 litres per
min. Detection parameters for each mass were optimized
with mobile phase B for CHR2863 (421.1 / 260.1),
CHR6768 (353.160 / 260.1) CHR2875 (496.0 / 382.2),
CHR2880 (428.0 / 382.2) and BB-1090 (366.2 / 119.7).
Data quantification was performed with Analyst (AB

chromatography software ver 2.10.

Red labeled lipid droplets in a cell were masked as objects
with a user defined pixel radius and brightness. The spot

Cytospins were prepared from U937/WT, U937/

cells were permeabilized with PBS/0.1% Triton-X100 for
10 min at 4oC. After washing with PBS, the cells were
blocked in 10% FCS for 30 min at room temperature.
Next, cells were washed three times in 100 µl PBS and
then incubated with primary CES1 polyclonal antibody
(1:400, diluted in PBS/0.1%BSA) and incubated for
1 hour at room temperature. Cells were then washed
three times with PBS and incubated with secondary
antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 633, 1:300 diluted in
PBS/0.1%BSA) for 45 min at room temperature. After
three times washing, cells were stained with Nile Red
(1:2500 dilutions from stock solution of 1 mg/ml in 10%
acetone in PBS) for 5 min. After washing 3 times with
PBS, cells were air dried in a flow chamber for 1min
followed by DAPI staining. The cytospin preparation was
then covered by a cover slip, fixed with nail polish, and
prepared for microscopy analysis. To this end, fixed cells
were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M Marianas™
inverted microscope, equipped with a motorized stage
(stepper-motor z-axis increments: 0.1 μm), and a turret of
four epifluorescence cubes (FITC, Cy-5, Cy-3, AMCA as
well as a DIC bright field cube). A cooled CCD camera
(Cooke Sensicam SVGA [Cooke Co., Tonawanda, NY],
1,280 × 1,024 pixels) recorded images with true 16-bit
capability. The camera is linear over its full dynamic range
(up to intensities of over 4,000) while dark/background
currents (estimated by the intensity outside the cells) is
typically < 100. Exposures, objective, montage, and pixel
binning were automatically recorded with each image
stored in memory (Dell Dimension workstation: Quadcore processor, 16GB RAM). The microscope, camera,
and data processing were controlled by SlideBook™
software (SlideBook™ version 5.5.2.0 [Intelligent
Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO]). All microscopy was
performed with a custom 40X or 63X oil-immersion lens
(Zeiss). The motorized filter cubes allowed acquisition
of one composite image (on all four different fluorescent
wavelengths) within 2 s. The data acquisition protocol
included optical planes to obtain 3-D definition. Moreover,
the software used is fully equipped to acquire, process
(several deconvolution modes), and display true 3-D data
and was used throughout the experiments.

Image stream analysis for lipid droplet counts
Cells (2 x 106) in the mid-log phase of growth were
harvested and washed 3 times with PBS/0.1% BSA and
resuspended in 1 ml PBS/0.1% BSA. Cells were then
incubated in the dark for 4 min at 25oC with Nile Red
(0.1 µg/ml final concentration from stock solution of 1
mg/ml in 10% acetone). Cells were then washed 3 times
protected from light with ice-cold PBS/0.1% BSA and
processed by ImageStream ISX analysis (Amnis, Seattle,
WA, USA), an instrument that combines microscopy and
flow cytometry in one platform. By imaging cells in flow,
the system - on a per cell basis - allows the measurement
of brightness, size and localization of fluorescently labeled
subcellular components and compilation of these data into
the population statistics of conventional FACS analysis.
The analysis software (Amnis, Seattle) utilizes two tool
sets; “masks” giving location to an object in an image
and “features” enabling measurement of the physical
properties of the objects defined by the mask. Thus, Nile

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Cholesterol assay

The authors declare that they have no conflict of
interest pertaining to this manuscript.

Intracellular
levels
of
cholesterol
and
cholesterylesters were determined by the Amplex Red
fluorometric assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)
according to the manufacturers’ procedure and described
by Li et al [73]. Briefly, 1 x 106 cells were harvested at
days 1, 2 and 3 after plating of regular cell cultures
of U937/WT cells, U937/CHR2863(200) and U937/
CHR2863(5uM) cells at their selective concentrations
of CHR2863 in the growth medium. Cells were washed
3 times with ice-cold PBS and aliquots of 2 x 105 cells
were centrifuged in Eppendorf tubes and cell pellets were
stored at -20oC until analysis. Levels of total cholesterol
(free-cholesterol and cholesteryl esters) were expressed as
ng/106 cells. As a control, cholesterol levels were analyzed
in U937/WT cells incubated with 1 mM of the cholesteroldepleting agent methyl-β-cyclo-dextrin (MβCD).
