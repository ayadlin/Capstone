ABSTRACT
A small population of cancer cells called cancer-initiating cells or cancer stem
cells (CSCs) are involved in drug resistance, metastasis, and cancer relapse. Finding
pathways that regulate CSC is very important for clinical therapy. ATP-binding cassette
sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) plays a role in side population (SP) cell formation and
contributes to chemotherapy resistance in common forms of cancer. Yes-associated
protein 1 (YAP1) is a major transcriptional effector of the Hippo pathway, which
plays important roles in organ size control and tumorigenesis. In this study, we
found ABCG2 and YAP1 were both overexpressed in lung cancer SP cells. Disruption
of YAP1 expression by siRNA attenuated the expression of ABCG2 transcript and
significantly reduced the percentage of SP cells and sphere formation in lung cancer
cells. Overexpression of YAP1 in lung cancers led to an increase in ABCG2 expression
and increased the percentage of SP cells. However, overexpression of YAP1 in purified
non-SP cells did not increase ABCG2 expression and the percentage of SP cells, which
may be due to the inhibition of YAP activity through phosphorylation. YAP1 directly
transcriptionally regulated ABCG2 by binding to the promoter of ABCG2. Moreover,
the YAP1 inhibitor verteporfin and YAP1 siRNA downregulated ABCG2 level through
inhibition of YAP1 in lung cancer cells and sensitized them to the chemotherapy drug
doxorubicin. Our study adds a new function for YAP1 that may be relevant to drug
resistance and cancer therapy through regulation of ABCG2 and side population cell
formation in lung cancer.

INTRODUCTION

assay called the side population (SP) assay [3–6]. The SP
assay is characterized by the differential potential of cells
to efflux a DNA-binding dye, Hoechst 33342. The high
efflux ability of CSCs leads to a low retention of Hoechst
33342 fluorescent signal in these cells, which reside at the
low-left corner in flow cytometry analysis and thus are
also known as side population (SP) cells or cancer stemlike cells [7]. The SP assay has emerged as a promising
method to identify stem cells and determine drug efficacy
in killing CSCs because it quantitatively analyzes the
relative number (%) of stem-like cancer cells in the overall
cancer cell population [8, 9].

Accumulating evidence indicates that tumors are a
heterogeneous mixture containing mostly non-stem cells
and a small subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs)
[1]. Despite the self-renewal and tumor initiation ability
of CSCs, they can also export certain toxic compounds
resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents and cause tumor
relapse [2]. The compound efflux ability of CSCs comes
from the increased expression of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters within the cell membrane and serves as
the basis of an important flow-cytometry-based cell-sorting

RESULTS

In lung cancer cells, ATP-binding cassette sub-family
G member 2 (ABCG2), an ABC transporter member, is
responsible for SP formation [8, 10]. ABCG2 contributes to
chemotherapeutic drug resistance in lung cancer treatment
and appears to be a predictor of survival in patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer [11]. SP cells sorted
out from lung cancer cells also demonstrate a greater
tumorigenic capacity than non-SP cells [5]. Consequently,
determining the molecular mechanism that controls
ABCG2 expression in lung cancer is very important for
developing more effective therapy that can downregulate
ABCG2 and lead to eradication of cancer stem cells.
The Hippo pathway was initially defined in
Drosophila. Because mutations in components of this
pathway lead to tissue and organ overgrowth, the Hippo
pathway is considered as a tumor suppressor pathway.
In mammals, the Hippo pathway consists of a conserved
core kinase cascade that includes serine/threonine kinases
MST1/2 (mammalian Ste2-like kinases 1/2) and LATS1/2
(large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2). In humans, when
the Hippo pathway is activated MST1/2 phosphorylates
and activates Lats1/2 kinase functions to inactivate Yesassociated protein 1 (YAP1) by directed phosphorylation on
YAP1 Ser 127. Phosphorylated YAP1 is sequestered in the
cytoplasm via binding to 14-3-3 and results in degradation.
Conversely, dephosphorylated YAP1 localizes in the
nucleus and acts mainly through TEAD family transcription
factors to induce gene expressions that promote cell
proliferation and organ growth. The other major effector of
the Hippo pathway, called TAZ (transcriptional coactivator
with PDZ binding motif), is regulated by LATS1/2 and acts
with TEADs in a similar manner to that of YAP1 [12–14].
TEAD transcription factors mediate genome-wide YAP1
chromatin-binding [15]. The known consensus motif for
TEAD is CATTCC [14]. YAP1 overexpression due to
amplification of the YAP1 gene, loss of Hippo signaling
by mutation, and/or down-regulation of core Hippo
components have been found in many cancers [16]. YAP1
overexpression also contributes to self-renewal and tumorinitiation capacities in cancer stem cells [17, 18]. YAP1
also reportedly contributes to promoting resistance to
anticancer drugs in different cancers like ovarian cancer and
hepatocellular carcinoma cells [19–22]. Verteporfin (trade
name Visudyne) has been identified as a YAP1 inhibitor
and can be readily used to study the effects of YAP1 [23,
24]. However, the relationship between YAP1 and ABCG2
and YAP1 regulation of cancer cell side population in lung
cancer have never been reported.
In this study, we asked whether YAP1 regulates
ABCG2 in lung cancer cells. To answer this question, we
investigated whether ABCG2 is a direct downstream target
of YAP1 and the potential therapeutic advantage of this
transcriptional regulation if it was confirmed.

YAP1 activity and ABCG2 mRNA and protein
levels are higher in SP cells than in non-SP cells
In order to analyze ABCG2 and YAP1 in SP cells,
we first sought to determine whether SP cells were present
in human NSCLC cell lines A549 and H460 and to sort
out SP cells and non-side population (non-SP) cells for
analysis. The SP cells were detected based on their ability
to exclude Hoechst 33342 dye and appeared as a distinct
tail at the bottom-left corner in the flow cytometry plots.
When the cells were pretreated with the ABC transporter
inhibitor verapamil, the tail disappeared or faded out. The
position where the tail disappeared was used as a control
to gate the area of SP cells. The A549 and H460 cell lines
respectively contained 1.28% and 3.98% SP cells. After
the cells were treated with verapamil, these percentages
decreased to 0.019% in A549 cells and 0.119% in H460
cells (Figure 1A). Western blot analysis of protein in
H460 SP and non-SP cells showed lower levels of LATS1,
phosphate-LATS1 and phosphate-YAP1 (S127), but higher
total YAP1 and ABCG2 levels in H460 SP cells than in
non-SP cells (Figure 1B). Around 3-fold YAP/P-YAP
ratio in SP cells of in non-SP cells indicated higher YAP1
activity present in SP cells (Figure 1C), as did the higher
level of GTIIC reporter activity in H460 SP cells than in
non-SP cells (Figure 1D). The SP and non-SP cells in both
NSCLC cell lines were then analyzed using Q-RT-PCR. In
both cell lines, mRNA levels of ABCG2, YAP1 and YAP1
downstream genes including BIRC5, CTGF and CYR61
were higher in SP cells than in non-SP cells except CD133
and AREG (Figure 1E and 1F).

Knockdown of YAP1 decreases ABCG2
expression, the percentage of SP cells and the
number of spheres formed in A549 and H460 cells
To investigate whether depletion of YAP1 influences
ABCG2, we treated A549 and H460 cell lines with two
different YAP1 siRNAs (siYAP1 #1 and siYAP1 #2). Both
YAP1 siRNAs reduced YAP1 mRNA level and protein
level significantly, as shown by Q-PCR and western
blot analysis (Figure 2A–2D). Knockdown of YAP1
decreased ABCG2 mRNA and protein levels. Since the
two YAP1 siRNAs had similar knockdown effects, we
only chose siYAP1 #2 for SP assay analysis and sphere
formation analysis. SP analysis showed that knockdown
of YAP1 reduced the percentage of SP cells from 1.92% to
0.735% in A549 cells and from 3.95% to 1.24% in H460
(Figure 2E to 2H). Knockdown of YAP1 also significantly
reduced the number of spheres in H460 and A549
(Figure 2I and 2J).

Overexpression of YAP1 increases ABCG2
expression and the percentage of SP cells in A549
and H460 cells

Overexpression of YAP1 does not increase
ABCG2 expression and the percentage of SP
cells in purified A549 and H460 non-SP cells

To verify that ABCG2 can be regulated by
YAP1 expression, we analyzed ABCG2 protein level
after forced over-expression of YAP1 gene in A549
and H460 by plasmid transfection. We found that
YAP1 protein level was increased after YAP1 plasmid
transfection, indicating that YAP1 plasmid transfection
was successful and YAP1 was overexpressed. Along
with the YAP1 overexpression, ABCG2 protein level
was increased (Figure 3A). The mRNA level of ABCG2
was also increased in purified SP cells after YAP1
overexpression (Figure 3F and 3G). SP assay analysis of
the cells transfected with YAP1 O/E plasmid and empty
vector indicated that YAP1 overexpression upregulated
the SP cell portion in A549 from 0.667% to 0.868% and
upregulated the SP cell portion in H460 from 6.60% to
9.00% (Figure 3B to 3E).

To examine whether YAP1 can actively turn non-SP
cells into SP cells, we purified non-SP cells from A549
and H460, over-expressed YAP1 through YAP1 plasmid
transfection, and measured the change in the percentage of
SP cells. YAP1 protein level was increased nearly 3-fold
after transfection, which indicated YAP1 was successfully
overexpressed (Figure 4A and 4B). However, ABCG2
protein level and the percentage of SP cells did not increase
after overexpression of YAP1 in purified non-SP cells
(Figure 4E to 4F). Since YAP1 activity was lower
in H460 non-SP cells due to higher level of active
LATS1, we wondered if the unchanged ABCG2 level
and SP percentage were due to inactivation of YAP1 by
phosphorylation on Ser 127 of YAP1. We examined the
phosphate-YAP1 (S127) level and found an increase
of P-YAP1 together with the increase of total YAP1.

Comparing the YAP1/P-YAP1 ratio, we found no
difference between control and YAP1- overexpressed
non-SP cells (Figure 4C and 4D). However, when we
overexpressed YAP1 S127A, the YAP1 mutant that
cannot be phosphorylated by LATS1/2 and is continuously

active, the SP percentage of purified non-SP cells was
increased (Supplementary Figure S1A–S1D). When
we overexpressed YAP1 wild type in purified and
cultured SP cells, the SP percentage also was increased
(Supplementary Figure S2A–2D).

YAP1 regulates ABCG2 at the transcriptional
level through binding to the promoter of ABCG2

540 bp upstream of the ABCG2 transcription start site
(Figure 5A). We used chromatin immunoprecipitations
(ChIPs) to test our hypothesis. We found that in H460
cells, ChIP studies using a YAP1-specific antibody
resulted in the precipitation of ABCG2 promoter
region encompassing the putative TEAD binding site
(Figure 5B). In the control ChIP assay using Rabbit
IgG or without any antibody, we did not detect ABCG2
promoter-region binding. These findings confirmed the
direct occupation of YAP1 to the promoter region of
ABCG2. Performing ChIP on YAP1 siRNA transfected
samples, we detected less ABCG2 promoter region

Our earlier experiments indicated that ABCG2
expression is regulated by YAP1. YAP1 as a
transcription coactivator, together with TEAD family
proteins, regulates many genes, including CTGF
[14]. We therefore wondered whether YAP1 regulates
ABCG2 at the transcriptional level. We examined
the ABCG2 promoter region (-1000 bp upstream of
transcription starting site of ABCG2) and found one
putative TEAD-binding site (CATTCC), which is

results of our Q-RT-PCR experiments also confirmed that

complex by preventing YAP1 and TEAD interaction
[23–25]. To investigate whether inhibiting YAP1-TEAD
activity affects ABCG2 in A549 and H460 cell lines,
we treated the cells with serial concentration dilutions
of verteporfin in 96 wells to measure the IC50 (the drug
concentration that kills 50% of cells) for A549 and H460
cells and determined the concentration for the SP assay.
The IC50 of vertepofin was 5.59 ± 1.50 µM for A549 and
5.01 ± 1.24 µM for H460. The lowest concentration of
verteporfin tested whereby cells started to show a response
was 1 µM. After cells were treated with 1 µM verteporfin,
cell viability was 97% for A549 cells and 93% for H460
cells. The cell viabilities for the same cell lines treated
with vehicle DMSO were both 100%. Therefore, we
chose 1 µM as the verteporfin concentration for western
blot analysis and the SP assay. The results of the western
blot analysis showed that verteporfin decreased the YAP1
protein level (Figure 6A). The ABCG2 protein level
also decreased when YAP1 was downregulated after
verteporfin treatment (Figure 6A). We used β–actin as the
protein gel loading control in the western blot analysis.
SP assay analysis of the cells treated with verteporfin
or vehicle DMSO indicated that verteporfin reduced the
percentage of SP cells in A549 from 0.640% to 0.012%
and reduced the percentage of SP cells in H460 from
2.06% to 0.007% (Figure 6B to 6E). Verteporfin also

significantly reduced the sphere formation of H460 and
A549 (Figure 6F to 6H).

Verteporfin potentiates the cytotoxicity of
doxorubicin
ABCG2 is involved in multidrug resistance
including to doxorubicin [26]. Since verteporfin can inhibit
ABCG2 transcription, we asked whether verteporfin could
help doxorubicin inhibit tumor cell growth. We measured
doxorubicin IC50 in A549 and H460 cells (Figure 7A
and 7B). The IC50 of doxorubicin was 0.496 ± 0.088 µM
for A549 cells and 0.226 ± 0.045 µM for H460 cells.
When the cells were treated with doxorubicin alone or
together with of various concentrations of verteporfin for
72 hours, we found that the combination of doxorubicin
and verteporfin yielded stronger cytotoxic effects than
either drug alone (Figure 7C and 7D). The isobolograms
of IC50 were used to measure the combination index (CI)
of two drugs[27] (Figure 7E and 7F). The IC50 isoboles
lay to the left of the additive isoboles, which indicated
synergistic action (CI < 1), which in turn indicated that
verteporfin significantly potentiated the cytotoxicity of
doxorubicin in A549 and H460 cells. We also examined
the effect of siYAP1 on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in
A549 and H460 cells. Transfection of siYAP1 alone did

more sensitive to doxorubicin at different concentrations.

The enhancement of doxorubicin cytotoxicity by siYAP1
and 1 µM verteporfin was similar (Figure 7G and 7H).

(Supplementary Table S1A). The IC50 of doxorubicin
was lower with 2 µM of verteporfin than with siYAP1
(Supplementary Table S1A). We also compared the
sensitivity of SP and non-SP cells to doxorubicin with and
without 1 µM verteporfin (Supplementary Table S1B).
The higher IC50 of doxorubicin in SP cells than in nonSP cells both in A549 and H460 cell lines indicated SP
cells were more resistant to doxorubicin toxicity. Addition

of 1 µM verteporfin with doxorubicin reduced the IC50 of
doxorubicin in SP cells and in non-SP cells.

regeneration by regulating tissue-specific stem cells [18].
Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway leading to abnormal
activity of YAP1/TAZ (e.g., a high protein level of YAP1/
TAZ and/or low phosphorylation level by LATS) has been
associated with cancer development. Moreover, compelling
evidence supports a role of YAP1/TAZ in cancer stem
cells. Our study provides several lines of evidence for an
expanded role for YAP1 in lung SP cells or cancer stemlike cells. First, YAP1 is overexpressed in purified H460
SP cells compared to non-SP cells. Further contributing
to YAP1 activation, phosphorylation of S127 in YAP1 is
also decreased in SP cells, indicating a hyper-activation
status of YAP in SP cells. Second, ectopic expression of
YAP1 increased the percentage of SP cells in both A549
and H460. Conversely, knockdown of YAP1 by siRNA
or reducing YAP1/TEAD transcriptional activity by the
YAP1 inhibitor verteporfin decreased the percentage of
SP cells and cell self-renewal activity to form spheres
in A549 and H460 cells. Third, overexpression of YAP1
increased the percentage of SP cells in purified H460 SP
cells. However, WT YAP1 overexpression cannot convert
purified non-SP cells into SP cells because the percentage
of SP cells was similar for control and YAP1 O/E cells.
In contrast, overexpression of YAP-S127A, which lacks
the phosphorylation site required for inactivation by the
Hippo pathway, can convert NSP cells to SP cells and
increase the percentage of SP cells in purified H460 nonSP cells. This is consistent with our finding that protein
and phosphorylation levels of LATS1 were lower in nonSP cells than in SP cells. The upper signal contributing
to this difference is unknown. It may be regulated by a
canonical Hippo pathway like MST1/2 or NF2 [28], or
by Rho-GTPase independent of the Hippo pathway [29].
Interestingly, TAZ expression did not differ between H460
SP and non-SP cells. This is different from the breast cancer
scenario. In breast cancer stem cells, TAZ, not YAP1, has
been shown to be a key regulator of breast cancer stem
cells. Collectively, our findings suggest an important role
of the Hippo pathway and YAP1 in lung cancer stem-like
cells.
We observed spontaneous conversion of
non-SP-to-SP and SP-to-non-SP (Supplementary
Figure S4). The conversion of non-SP-to-SP under our
normal lung cancer cell culture conditions is slower than
the conversion of SP-to-non-SP. But both the purified
SP and non-SP cells reached a steady level resembling
that of unsorted cultures after limited culture days and
limited passages. Although the 4-way purity setting we
used in a FACS-ARIA II cytometer is supposed to only
sort drops free of contaminating particles, we cannot rule
out possible cross-contamination between SP and nonSP fractions during cell purification. The reversibility of
SP and non-SP was also found in embryonic stem cell
cultures [30]. Despite use of a single cell purification
method, there was still a conversion between these two
fractions. Studies using other stem cell markers to purify
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stem cells also found that normal and neoplastic non-stem
cells can spontaneously convert to a stem-like state [31].
The mechanism underlying the reversibility of SP and
non-SP is currently unknown.
SP cells in human cancer cells show stem-like
properties, including high tumorigenic activity and chemoresistance [8, 9]. ABCG2 is the major contributor of the SP
cell properties of lung cancer cells [5, 6, 8]. It is partially
responsible for multi-drug resistance to chemotherapeutic
treatment and its overexpression is linked to adverse
prognosis in common forms of cancer [3, 4, 11, 26,
32–36]. We found co-localization of ABCG2 and the
Hippo pathway effector YAP1 in lung carcinoma SP cells.
Our ChIP data indicated that YAP1 directly regulated
ABCG2 expression at the transcriptional level in H460
lung cancer cells. The change in ABCG2 protein level
was concurrent with YAP knockdown or overexpression,
which also suggested a positive regulation of ABCG2 by
YAP1. Hence addition of a YAP inhibitor to an ABCG2
substrate like doxorubicin [37] is highly likely to cause
a synergetic rather than an additive effect on cancer cell
viability. Consistently, we found that co-treatment with the
chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin and the YAP1-TEAD
inhibitor verteporfin, or knockdown of YAP expression
with siYAP1, improved the efficacy of doxorubicin in lung
carcinoma cells in a synergistic manner. This synergistic
effect was also present in purified SP and non-SP lung
cancer cells (Supplementary Table S1B).
Accumulating evidence suggests that YAP1 plays a
role in promoting drug resistance, including chemotherapy
and target therapy [19–22, 38, 39]. The mechanism of
YAP1-promoted resistance includes activation of the
receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, the apoptosis inhibitor
Survivin (BIRC5) genes, and autophagy depending on
different drugs in different cancers. Our finding expands
what is known about YAP1-promoted drug resistance
through regulating a well-known ABC-transporter,
ABCG2, in lung cancer. To the best of our knowledge,
ours is the first study to report that YAP1 directly
transcriptionally regulates ABCG2, a major multidrug
transporter implicated in lung cancer, and that deactivation
of YAP1 efficiently eliminates SP cells in lung cancer
cells. We cannot rule out that crosstalk or a combination
of different mechanisms underlies the synergistic effect
of verteporfin or siYAP with doxorobucin treatment
in lung cancer cells. A recent study also linked YAP1
overexpression with other ABC-transporters, including
ABCC1 and ABCB1, in ovarian initiated cells [40].
However, ABCG2 was not reported as a downstream
effector of YAP1 in that study.
Because YAP1 holds potential for cancer therapy,
the mechanism by which the YAP1 inhibitor verteporfin
exerts its action has also been studied. Verteporfin initially
was proposed as a YAP1-TEAD complex inhibitor that
prevented YAP1-TEAD interaction [24]. Subsequently,
more evidence, including our current study, indicated

verteporfin can also decrease YAP1 protein level [39]. The
mechanism for YAP reduction by verteporfin is through
upregulation of 14-3-3σ, which sequesters YAP1 in the
cytoplasm and leads to YAP1 degradation [41]. However,
verteporfin can act as an autophagosome inhibitor by
promoting oligomerization of p62 and inhibit colon cancer
progression independently of YAP1 [25, 42]. Hence, more
specific inhibitors for YAP1/TEAD are needed for future
study and clinical application.
ABCG2 has been shown to be transcriptionally
regulated by Gli1, E2F1 and Nrf2 under different
conditions in different cell types [43–45]. Further study
is needed to determine whether the regulation of ABCG2
by these proteins and YAP1 involves cross-talk or is
independent, and which protein is the major regulator
under different scenarios. YAP1 is known to play
important roles in organ size control and tumorigenesis
[12–14]. Our study adds an important new function for
YAP1 that may be relevant to cancer stem cells, drug
resistance and cancer therapy. Future studies should focus
on whether YAP1-ABCG2 regulation is active in a variety
of tumor types and whether this affects the outcomes of
clinical drugs for each disease.

for attachment and treated with different concentrations
of verteporfin, or with doxorubicin with or without
verteporfin for another 72 hours. Then 100 µl of the
CellTiter-Glo reagent was added into each well for a
10-minute incubation. The plate was read by a GloMax
96 microplate luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI)
to monitor the luminescence signal generated by the
luciferase-catalyzed reaction of luciferin and ATP.

Side population assay and sorting
Cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (control) or
1 µM verteporfin for 72 hours, trypsinized and resuspended
in DMEM with 2% (v/v) FBS medium at 1 × 106
cells/ml concentration, and incubated with 5 µg/ml Hoechst
33343 dye in the presence or absence of 100 µM verapamil
at 37°C for 60 min. Tubes were gently inverted every
20 min and then centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The
pellets were resuspended in cold PBS containing 2 µg/ml
propidium iodide and analyzed on a BD FACS Aria II cell
sorter. Emission was collected through a 610-nm long pass
dichronic mirror to a 620-nm long pass filter for the Hoechst
red (x-axis) collection and a 424/44-nm band pass filter for
the Hoechst blue (y-axis) collection. The side population
was identified as a group of cells able to exclude the Hoechst
dyes, a characteristic inhibited with verapamil. In each
experiment, the SP gate was set on the basis of the 100 µM
verapamil control sample. The detailed step-by-step gating
strategy to exclude debris and dead cells was followed [46].
Side population cells and non-SP cells were sorted into
5 ml tubes. The sorting mode was set as Device: 2 tubes;
Precision: 4-Way Purity; Target Events: Continuous.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
A549 and H460 established human lung cancer
cell lines (originally purchased from The American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultivated
in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin. Culture ﬂasks were kept at 37°C and 5%
