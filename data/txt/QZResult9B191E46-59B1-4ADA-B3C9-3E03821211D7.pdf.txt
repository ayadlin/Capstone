Abstract
Although meningioma stem-like cells have been isolated and characterized, their
therapeutic targeting remains a challenge. Meningioma sphere cells (MgSCs) with
cancer stem cells properties show chemo- and radioresistance in comparison with
meningioma adherent cells (MgACs). We tested the effect of valproic acid (VPA), a
commonly used anti-epileptic drug, which passes the blood brain barrier, on cultured
MgSCs. VPA reduced the viability of MgSCs and MgACs. In MgSCs, treatment with VPA
increased radio-sensitivity, expression of p-cdc2, p-H2AX and cleaved caspase-3 and
PARP. Anchorage-independent growth (AIG) was reduced by VPA. AIG was further
reduced by combined treatment with irradiation. Expression of a stem cell marker,
Oct4, was reduced by VPA. Oct4 was further decreased by combined treatment
with irradiation. These results suggest that VPA may be a potential treatment for
meningioma through targeting meningioma stem-like cells.

INTRODUCTION

to be 20% for World Health Organization (WHO) grade
I, 40% for WHO grade II, and 78% for WHO grade III
meningiomas [7]. Aggressive meningiomas are related
to the high incidence of recurrence and mortality [8].
Management of recurrent meningioma currently is repeat
surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. Patients
with aggressive meningiomas are treated with prior
surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. However,
atypical and anaplastic meningiomas remain challenging
tumors to treat. Known risk factors such as a larger tumor
size, nuclear atypia, increased mitotic rate, and necrosis
are key to recurrence [8]. Since mainstream management
of meningioma is surgical resection and stereotactic
radiosurgery, anti-cancer drugs are less identified as
treatment in management of meningioma. Without doubt,
the development of adjuvant therapy is warranted to
improve tumor control and minimize recurrence.
Valproic acid (VPA, 2-propylpentanoic acid) has
been used extensively as an anti-convulsant for more than
40 years and is a frequent choice for patients with seizures
[9]. As a histone deacetylase inhibitor, VPA can induce
the differentiation of many kinds of cancer cells in vitro
and suppress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo [10].

The presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is well
documented in many kinds of human tumors [1]. With
the ability of self-renewal [2], CSCs are considered
responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance, and
metastasis. Several studies have isolated human
meningioma stem-like cells and characterized their CSCs
properties. Isolated meningioma stem-like cells can form
spheres and express the CD133 stem cell marker [3-5].
Moreover, isolated meningioma sphere cells (MgSCs)
possess chemo- and radioresistant properties and express
multiple drug-resistant genes, compared to meningioma
adherent cells (MgACs) [3]. Studies by Kalamarides et
al. have also demonstrated that different subtypes of
meningioma come from a common prostaglandin D2
synthase-positive progenitor cell [6]. Although the biology
of meningioma stem-like cells has been well established
[3-6], therapeutic strategies targeting CSCs in meningioma
remain unclear.
Meningioma is among the most common
intracranial tumors and accounts for 13-26% of all
intracranial neoplasms. The recurrence rate is reported

It improves the responsiveness of tumors to conventional
therapeutic agents and increases the radiosensitivity
of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [11]. VPA
has been investigated for its anti-cancer effect in many
experimental human cancer models of lung cancer [12],
renal cell carcinoma [13], bladder cancer [14], myeloma
cell [15], and cervical cancer [16]. Its anti-tumor activity
varies depending on the cell type and is conducted
through multiple mechanisms, such as cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, differentiation, and
senescence [17]. The purpose of this study is to examine
the therapeutic potential of VPA through the targeting of
MgSCs, and explore the related mechanisms.

cells as a single factor [18]. Day 2 cultured MgSCs formed
spheres (Figure 1A) and were positive for Oct4 (Figure
1B), but daughter MgACs had relatively low expression
on Oct4. Oct4 mRNA expressions in MgSCs and MgACs
were determined by RT-PCR (Figure 1C).

Cell viability of MgSCs and MgACs was reduced
by VPA
VPA could induce apoptosis in tumors but not in
non-malignant cells [19, 20]. To investigate cell toxicity
of VPA on MgSCs and MgACs, cells were treated with
VPA for 72 h and the cell viability was determined by
MTS assay. At 1 mM ~16 mM, VPA reduced cell viability
on both MgSCs and MgACs in a dose-response manner
(p<0.001) (Figure 2A), but not on human adipocytederived stem cells (hASCs), which served as a nonmalignant control, compared to untreated cells. MgSCs
were more susceptible to VPA than MgACs at 2 and 4 mM.
There were no differences in cell viability between MgSCs
and MgACs at 16 mM VPA (Figure 2A). Representative
microphotographs are shown in Figure 2B. These results
showed that both MgSCs and MgACs were susceptible to
VPA treatment, especially MgSCs.

RESULTS
Expression of Oct4 in MgSCs versus MgACs
To further characterize the stem-like properties
of MgSCs, the expression of stem cell marker was
analyzed by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Of the
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell factors, Oct4 was first
examined since it could reprogram adult stem cells to iPS

Combined treatment with VPA and irradiation
induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA
damage in MgSCs

like cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA fragmentation.

Combined VPA and irradiation decreased the
colony formation of MgSCs

Despite the chemoresistance of MgSCs to vincristine
[3], VPA induced more severe cell death in MgSCs than
in MgACs (Figure 2). The MgSCs were treated with an
IC50 dose of VPA (2 mM) and irradiation (5Gy) alone
or in combination, and were subjected to MTS assay.
The results revealed that MgSCs pre-treated with VPA
had reduced cell viability with the use of irradiation
compared to the untreated control (p < 0.01) (Figure 3A),
indicating that VPA increased the radio-sensitivity of
MgSCs. Moreover, p-cdc2 (Tyr15), which was elevated
in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle [21], was significantly
induced by the combined treatment, compared to the
untreated control (p < 0.01) (Figure 3B). The cleavage of
apoptotic proteins, caspase-3 and PARP was also induced
by the combined treatment (Figure 3C). DNA damageinducing p-H2AX [22] was also significantly induced by
the combined treatment, compared to the untreated control
(p < 0.001) (Figure 3D). These findings indicate that VPA
enhanced the radiosensitivity of MgSCs and that combined
treatment decreased MgSCs survival through mechanisms

Since VPA could induce cell differentiation
and anchorage-independent growth (AIG) was a key
criterion for tumor metastasis [17], the effects of VPA
and irradiation on MgSCs AIG were determined by softagar assay. The number of colony formations in MgSCs
treated with radiation or VPA alone was significantly
reduced (*p < 0.05 and #p < 0.001, respectively) (Figure
4). Moreover, combined treatment significantly reduced
colony formation compared to both the untreated control
(#p < 0.001) and irradiation alone (**p < 0.01).

Combined treatment with VPA and irradiation
down-regulated Oct4 expression
To investigate the stem-like properties of MgSCs
after treatment with VPA or irradiation alone or in
combination, Oct4 expression was examined by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. The expression of Oct4
in MgSCs was significantly reduced by VPA, but not by

in cancer therapy. Supporting this hypothesis, this study
found that VPA reduces Oct4 expression in MgSCs (Figure
5). Moreover, AIG is greatly impaired by VPA treatment
(Figure 4), suggesting the loss of stemness of MgSCs. The
finding of the differentiation-promoting activity of VPA
on MgSCs is consistent with previous studies on various
cancer cells, including neuroblastoma [23], glioblastoma
[24], head and neck cancer [25], thyroid cancer [26], and
uveal melanoma [27]. Furthermore, recent studies using
isolated glioblastoma-derived stem cells treated with VPA
showed a reduced proliferation rate and expression of stem
cell markers, including Oct4, indicating cell differentiation
[28].
VPA also promotes cell self-renewal and reprogramming in a cancer type-dependent manner.
For example, inclusion of VPA in the reprogramming
procedure can significantly increase the efficiency of iPS
cells induction in cells over-expressing Oct4, Sox2, and
Klf-4 [29]. Moreover, VPA increases the proliferation and
self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
to expand the HSC pool [30]. Mechanistic investigation
by Teng et al. revealed that VPA activates the hormone

DISCUSSION
Using isolated meningioma stem-like cells, this
study investigated the therapeutic potential of VPA
and irradiation on drug-resistant meningioma. MgSCs
treated with VPA prior to irradiation show reduced radioresistance and anchorage-independent growth. Activation
of signaling pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle
arrest, and DNA damage, were observed with combined
treatment with VPA and irradiation, along with reduced
Oct4 expression. These results suggest that combined
treatment with VPA and irradiation might be a novel
therapeutic strategy in the treatment of radioresistant
meningiomas.
As CSCs are considered the major cause of chemoresistance, radioresistance, and early recurrence of tumor,
the induction of differentiation by VPA may hold promise

mechanisms of old drugs may open new windows for
developing chemotherapeutic agents targeting CSCs.
Despite inducing CSCs differentiation, a novel concept
targeting the conserved mitochondrial biogenesis pathway
among CSCs to reduce its clonal expansion was also
reported for FDA-approved antibiotics [42].
In summary, the present study suggests VPA is
a potentially effective drug in the treatment of high
recurrence meningioma. MgSCs and MgACs are both
sensitive to VPA, which significantly reduces the
radioresistance and anchorage-independent growth of
MgSCs. VPA increases the susceptibility of MgSCs to
irradiation. Oct4 expression in MgSCs was dramatically
reduced by combined treatment with VPA and irradiation.
These results also provide a novel insight into the
development of an effective therapeutic strategy using
a lower drug dosage and irradiation for the treatment of
meningioma.

response element on the Oct4 promoter through the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and exhibits a pluripotencypromoting effect in myogenic cells [31, 32]. Studies on
isolated breast cancer stem-like cells showed that VPA
promotes cell de-differentiation via WNT/β-catenin
signaling [33], suggesting the effect of VPA on CSCs was
in a cancer type-dependent manner.
The divergent effect of VPA on cell differentiation
has also been reported in previous studies, suggesting
an association with cell differentiation level and
underlying genetic alternation [34]. Since the functional
proteomic expression varies with different cell types, the
identification of specific molecular targets activated by
VPA for promoting MgSCs differentiation may shed light
on the application of VPA for cancer therapy.
The anti-cancer effects of VPA include cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage, and vary according to
cell types [17]. In MgSCs, 2 mM VPA cannot significantly
alter the activation of the apoptotic protein caspase-3
and PARP, cell cycle arrest protein p-cdc2, and DNAdamage inducing p-H2AX. However, the possibility that
2 mM VPA can induce cell death in MgSCs through cell
apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and DNA damage cannot
be completely ruled out, since limited protein targets
have been examined. In addition, previous studies have
demonstrated that VPA also induces cell death through a
caspase-independent pathway [35] and by autophagy [36].
Whether VPA induced MgSCs cell death through these
pathways needs further investigation.
Combined treatment significantly induces p-cdc2,
cleavage of caspase-3, cleavage of PARP, and p-H2AX
expression with reduced cell viability, indicating a
synergistic effect on signaling activation to promote cell
death. VPA-induced radiosensitization has also been
reported in various cancers, including colon cancer [37],
esophageal squamous carcinoma [11], prostate cancer
[38], and glioma [39]. With regard to combination
therapies for CSCs, Jokinen et al. proposed drug ablation
of the ALK oncogene using the ALK tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, TAE684, in combination with PI3K inhibitor,
or salinomycin. The features of CSCs were inverted with
reduction of colony formation, indicating combination
drug therapies can suppress CSCs features in acquired and
adaptive resistance [40].
In vivo phase III clinical trials have been conducted
or are ongoing using VPA alone or in combination with
irradiation or other chemotherapeutic drugs for the
treatment of cancers such as advanced cervical cancer
(Table 1) [41]. Since VPA can pass the blood brain barrier,
the above strong in vivo evidence from human clinical
trials further supports the rationale for the potential
application of VPA in the treatment of brain meningiomas.
Our study clarifies the mechanism of action of VPA in
meningioma stem-like cells, and further supports the
evidence from the above in vivo clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The protocol for the maintenance of meningioma
stem-like cells was as described previously [3]. In brief,
meningioma stem-like cells were cultured in medium to
obtain MgSCs from primary meningioma cells, while the
control MgACs were maintained in Dulbecco modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Harlan–Seralab, Belton, UK) on coating dishes.
Stem cell culture medium contained serum-free stem
cell culture neurobasal DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, CA,
USA), B27 supplement, fresh aliquots of growth factors,
10 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor
(EGF; Peprotech Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), and 10 ng/ml
recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF;
Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The human adiposederived stem cells (hASCs) were provided by S.M. Huang
[43] and maintained in DMEM-low glucose (DMEMLG; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen)
to form sphere cells as non-tumor control cells. The cells
were maintained in culture dishes at 37°C in 5% carbon
dioxide.
The medium was changed every 3 days. When the
cells grew to 70-90% confluence, they were trypsinized
(0.25% trypsin; Sigma), and then neutralized by culture
medium. The cells were passed at a ratio of 1:3. The
characterization of human ASCs was as described
previously [44].

MTS assay

Cell lysate preparation and Western blots

The CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was
used for MTS assay. MgSCs, MgACs, and hASCs (2×104)
were grown in 96-well plates with fresh culture medium.
Following treatment with control solvent or VPA, 20 μl
MTS solution was added to each well and the plate was
allowed to incubate for 4 h at 37°C. The same dilution of
MTS solution in DMEM/F12 medium alone was used as
the background.
After incubation, absorbance was recorded at 490
nm. For data analysis, background values were subtracted
from all sample values. The calculated absorbance was
directly proportional to the number of living cells in the
culture.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000g
for 10 min and lysed by RIPA buffer (100mM Tris-HCl,
150mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton-X-100) at 4°C for
10 min. The cell lysates were harvested by centrifugation
at 15000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatants for
Western blotting. In brief, aliquots of 20 μg proteins from
each group were applied to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed for 3 h at 80
V. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinyldifluoride
membranes (Millipore) and blocked with 5% bovine
serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Band
detection was conducted by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Millipore) and an LAS-3000 imaging system (Fujifilm,
Tokyo, Japan). Band densities were measured with the gel
analysis system (BioSpectrumAC Imaging System Vision
Work LS software; UVP, Upland, CA, USA) [47].

Reagents and irradiation treatment

RNA isolation and RT-PCR

VPA was obtained from Sanofi-Aventis (Paris,
France). Antibody against Oct4, p-cdc2, total cdc2, and
PARP were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers,
MA). Antibody against caspase-3 and p-H2AX were
purchased from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Antibody
against α -actinin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech,
Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For the radioresistance assay, the
cells were irradiated using a CyberKnife radio-surgery
system (Accuray, USA) to deliver different doses.

Total RNA was extracted using EasyPure Total
RNA reagent (Bioman, Taiwan, ROC) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1.0
μg) was reverse transcribed (RT) with MMLV
ReverseTranscriptase
(Epicentre
Biotechnologies,
USA) according to the manufacturer‘s instructions.
The primer pairs used were: Oct4 forward, 5’GAGAATTTGTTCCTGCAGTGC -3’ and reverse, 5’GTTCCCAATTCCTTCCTTAGTG -3’ [48] and GAPDH
forward, 5’- CTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3’and reverse,
5’-GCCATCCACAGTCTTCTG-3’. The PCR products
were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with
UV light after ethidium bromide staining.

Immunofluorescence staining
The immunofluorescence staining followed the
previous method [3, 21, 45, 46]. The MgACs and
MgSCs were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min, blocked
with bovine serum albumin for 1 h, washed with PBS
containing 0.1% Tween 20, and stained with Oct4
antibody, nuclear dye propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, St
Louis, MO, USA), or nuclear dye 4’,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) for 1 h at 4°C. Immunofluorescence
was detected after incubation with the appropriate
secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC (eBioscience,
San Diego, CA, USA) at room temperature for 45 min.
After mounting cover-slips with SlowFade Light antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA),
immunofluorescent pictures were acquired using a CCD
camera (Zeiss). The scale bar was labeled using the SPOT
RT3 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights,
MI, USA).

Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar assay
Cell suspensions (1x104) were incubated in an
upper layer of 0.3% agar (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) in
DMEM with 2% FBS. This was overlaid on 0.5% basal
agar with 2% FBS. Cultures were maintained for 16 days,
replenishing the upper medium layer twice a week, and
then staining with methylene blue diluted in ethanol.
Colonies were counted by microscopy (CK2; Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical analysis
All data were calculated using IBM SPSS statistics
20. Data were expressed as mean±standard error of
the mean (SEM) and differences between counts were
determined using One way Anova. Statistical significance
was set at p < 0.05.
