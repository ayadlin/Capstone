BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertions (exon20ins) represent approximately 10% of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas, and are associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Clinical outcomes in comparison with patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations are not well established. METHODS: Patients with stage IV lung
adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins were identified through routine molecular testing. Clinicopathologic data were collected.
Overall survival (OS) was measured from the diagnosis of stage IV disease, and in patients treated with EGFR TKIs, the time to progression (TTP) on erlotinib was measured. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and eighty-two patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas were identified: 46 patients had EGFR exon20ins (2%), and 258 patients had an EGFR exon 19 deletion (exon19del)/
L858R point mutation (14%). Among 11 patients with lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins who received erlotinib, 3 patients
(27%) had a partial response (FQEA, 1; ASV, 1; and unknown variant, 1). TTP for patients with EGFR exon20ins and patients with EGFR
exon19del/L858R on erlotinib were 3 and 12 months, respectively (P <.01). Responses to chemotherapy were similar for patients with
lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins and patients with lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon19del/L858R. Median OS from
the diagnosis of stage IV disease for patients with EGFR exon20ins and patients with EGFR exon19del/L858R was 26 months (95%
confidence interval, 19 months-not reached n 5 46) and 31 months (95% confidence interval, 28-33 months; n 5 258), respectively
(P 5.53). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR exon20ins do not respond
to EGFR TKI therapy. Standard chemotherapy should be used as first-line therapy. These patients have an OS similar to that of
patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations. Individuals with certain variants such as FQEA and ASV may respond to erlotinib. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Therapeutic targeting of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has
demonstrated efficacy in lung adenocarcinomas, with the presence of an EGFR mutation within the tyrosine kinase domain predicting the response to EGFR TKIs.1-3 In particular, an EGFR exon 19 deletion (exon19del) and the L858R
point mutation in exon 21 are sensitizing mutations that result in favorable responses to therapy with both reversible
and irreversible EGFR TKIs.1,2,4-10 Over time, through the institution of routine molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinomas, rarer mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have begun to emerge11-15 with an uncertain responsiveness to EGFR TKIs.
Retrospective data initially suggested that EGFR exon 20 insertions (exon20ins) conferred resistance to EGFR TKI therapy, and thus this subset of patients has been omitted from many prospective clinical studies.9,10,16 Published retrospective
studies investigating this genotypic subset of lung adenocarcinoma have demonstrated that EGFR exon20ins occur more commonly in patients who are female, Asian, and never-smokers; thus, similar to patients whose tumors harbor classically sensitizing EGFR mutations.12,13,17-21 The response to EGFR TKI therapy for these patients has been explored in small retrospective

series of between 2 to 25 patients.12,17-22 These studies have
demonstrated mixed results with respect to the objective
response rate to EGFR TKIs, progression-free survival
(PFS), and overall survival (OS).
There are preclinical data suggesting that cells containing certain EGFR exon20ins variants may have an affinity for EGFR TKIs, similar to that of cells harboring
EGFR exon19del and L858R. When studied in vitro, the
EGFR exon20ins variant A763_Y764insFQEA was the
only EGFR exon20ins harboring cell line inhibited by
erlotinib at concentrations less than 0.1 lM. Yasuda
et al17 subsequently examined the crystal structure of cells
harboring EGFR exon20ins, and through kinetic studies
and conformational analysis, demonstrated that other
EGFR exon20ins such as D770_N771insNPG have a
reduced affinity and sensitivity to EGFR TKIs similar to
wild-type EGFR.
In light of our increasing knowledge of the function
of EGFR mutations and the structural differences between
rarer subtypes, including EGFR exon20ins variants, further studies are needed to examine differential responses
to EGFR TKIs and OS for patients who harbor these
mutations. This retrospective study aimed to assess the
clinicopathologic features, responses to EGFR TKI therapy, and OS from the diagnosis of stage IV disease for
patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas harboring
EGFR exon20ins.

were not enrolled on an official protocol, the imaging frequency was variable, and imaging took place on average every 2 to 3 months. Patients with incomplete or unknown
treatment data were excluded from treatment analyses.
Molecular Testing

The detection of known sensitizing mutations in EGFR
(exon19del and L858R) was performed via a combination
of fragment analysis and mass spectroscopy genotyping
with previously described methods.14,23 All patients with
advanced lung adenocarcinoma who were assessed at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center underwent
mass spectrometry genotyping (Sequenom) of EGFR,
KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2/HER2, NRAS, AKT, MAP2K1, and
PIK3CA, as previously described.23 This involves a series
of multiplexed assays that assess patients for the presence
of 92 nonsynonymous point mutations in 6 multiplex
reactions. EGFR exon20ins were identified with fragment
analysis. When EGFR exon20ins were detected, Sanger
sequencing was completed to confirm the presence of the
mutation and identify the insertion position and
sequence. Initial screening was conducted via a sizing
assay with the primers FW1:50-TCTTCACCTGGAAG
GGGTCCA-30 and REV1:50-Fam-TGCCACCTCC
ACTCCGTCTA-30. Positive cases were characterized via
Sanger sequencing with the primers FW1:50-CATTCA
TGCGTCTTCACCTG-30 and REV1:50-GTATA
GGGGTACCGTTTGAG-30.14,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Statistical Analyses

Study Population and Data Collection

Overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) on
EGFR TKI therapy were calculated using the KaplanMeier method. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis
of stage IV disease until the date of death from any cause.
TTP was defined as the time from the commencement of
an EGFR TKI, until radiologic progression. For both OS
and TTP analyses, patients who did not experience the
event of interest during the study time were censored at
the time of data cutoff (December 2013). OS and TTP
were compared across groups using the log-rank test. The
clinical characteristics of patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR exon19del and L858R
mutation were compared to those with EGFR exon20ins,
using Fisher’s exact test. Pathologic characteristics are presented descriptively.

Patients with lung adenocarcinomas at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center whose tumors underwent routine molecular diagnostic testing between 2009 and 2013
were identified from programmatically abstracted elements of diagnostic molecular pathology reports and tumor registration data available via a Web-based
application. A Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
institutional review board and privacy board waiver was
obtained to facilitate the retrospective collection of clinicopathologic data. The results were reviewed to identify
patients with metastatic disease. Collected clinical data
included: age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, and
smoking history (current/former smoker or never smoker).
Pathologic data included: EGFR mutation position, EGFR
exon20ins length, exact amino acid sequence, and presence
or absence of concurrent mutations. Extracted treatment
data included the types of treatment, number of lines of
therapy, receipt of an EGFR TKI, duration of treatment,
and radiologic response to therapy. Because these patients

Pathologic Characteristics

The molecular characteristics of the patients with stage IV
lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins (n 5 46) are
detailed in Table 2. The base pair length ranged from 3 to
12 base pairs, and 61% of the patients (28 of 46) had
tumors with a 9–base pair insertion. All patients with
EGFR exon20ins that were identified by fragment analysis, subsequently underwent Sanger sequencing. Sequencing in 1 case failed, and 1 case had a very low tumor
content, such that the the previously identified EGFR
mutation could not be confidently characterized. Seventeen unique EGFR exon20ins variants were identified,
and are depicted in Table 2. The variants most frequently
seen were D770_N771insSVD (11 of 46 or 24%) and
V769_D770insASV (10 of 46 or 22%).
Among the 46 patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins, 2 patients with
D770_N771insSVD and 1 patient with a V769_D770insASV variant had concurrent phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) mutations. Two patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR exon20ins had multiple synchronous lung cancers, with 2 resected lung adenocarcinomas per patient. In
these 2 patients, 1 lesion harbored an EGFR exon20ins,
and the second resected lesion contained a KRAS
Q61H mutation (EGFR exon20ins H773_v774insNPH)

Treatment and Survival Data

Treatment data was available for all 46 patients with
tumors harboring an EGFR exon20ins. Three patients
did not receive systemic therapy: 2 received supportive
care only, and 1 patient declined therapy. The median
number of lines of therapy for the entire cohort was 2
(range: 0-7). In patients who received erlotinib
(n 5 11), the median number of lines of therapy was 3
(range: 1-7), and in those who did not receive erlotinib

(n 5 35), the median number was 2 (range: 0-5). The
11 patients treated with erlotinib received the following
systemic therapies: platinum doublet with or without
maintenance (7 of 11: platinum/pemetrexed, 5; platinum/taxane, 2), single-agent chemotherapy (5 of 11:
docetaxel, 2; gemcitabine, 2; pemetrexed, 1), immunotherapy (2 of 11), and cetuximab (1 of 11). Patients who
did not receive erlotinib (n 5 35) received similar types
of systemic therapy: platinum doublet with or without
maintenance (28 of 35: platinum/pemetrexed, 25; platinum/taxane, 3), single-agent chemotherapy (17 of 35:
docetaxel, 8; gemcitabine, 7; pemetrexed, 2), and
immunotherapy (2 of 35).
The most common systemic therapies received by
the entire cohort were platinum doublet chemotherapy
(76% or 35 of 46: platinum/pemetrexed, 30; platinum/
taxane, 5), single-agent chemotherapy (48% or 22 of
46: docetaxel, 10; gemcitabine, 9; pemetrexed, 3), and
immunotherapy (9% or 4 of 46: nivolumab, 2;
MPDL3280A, 1; pembrolizumab, 1). The response
rates to the systemic therapies received by patients with
EGFR exon20ins were as follows: platinum doublet
chemotherapy, 63% (22 of 35); single-agent chemotherapy, 32% (7 of 22); immunotherapy, 50% (2 of 4);
and cetuximab, 0% (0 of 1). The response rates for the 3
most common regimens were as follows: platinum doublet, 63% (22 of 35); docetaxel, 30% (3 of 10); and
gemcitabine, 22% (2 of 9). The median durations of
therapy for the 3 most common regimens were as follows: platinum doublet, 6 months (range, 1-36
months); docetaxel, 3 months (range, 1-9 months); and
gemcitabine, 2 months (range, 1-18 months).
Eleven patients were treated with erlotinib at the discretion of the treating physician, and none of them

patients were reported in a previous publication, and they
were among the 8 patients who did not respond to erlotinib.11 Treatment responses to erlotinib and corresponding molecular data for these 11 patients are detailed in

Table 3. Three of the 11 patients with tumors harboring
EGFR exon20ins had a partial response to erlotinib. The
median TTP for the 11 patients treated with erlotinib was
shorter than that for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations, who
were treated with erlotinib (2.5 vs 12.2 months, P < .001;
Fig. 2). The patient with a mutation in the C-helix of
exon 20 (patient 1 in Table 3; A763_Y764insFQEA)
exhibited a partial response to therapy and a short TTP
but had an OS from the diagnosis of stage IV disease, of
25 months. Patient 2 harbored a mutation in exon 20 outside the C-helix (V769_D770insASV) and exhibited a
partial response to erlotinib, a prolonged TTP of 20
months, and an OS of 24 months. The third patient who
responded to erlotinib had a short-lived partial response
to therapy and a median OS of 19 months; unfortunately,
tumor tissue failed sequencing, so the exact EGFR exon20ins variant present was unknown (patient 11 in Table
3). The median OS for patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins and patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations was similar (26 vs 31 months,
P 5 .53; Fig. 3). The 3 patients with concurrent EGFR
exon20ins and PIK3CA mutations did not receive erlotinib, and their survival times from the date of diagnosis
until death were 33.2 (D770_N771insSVD), 38
(D770_N771ins SVD), and 2.8 months (V769_D770insASV), respectively. All treatments received by these 11

DISCUSSION
The diagnosis and management of advanced lung adenocarcinomas has changed dramatically in the last decade.
Diagnostic molecular testing has defined molecular subsets that have improved responses and survival with the
use of targeted therapy, versus a purely histology-based
classification and the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy
alone. As broader molecular testing becomes routine, we
are identifying rarer genetic alterations and further subclassifying gene mutations previously identified, such as
exon20ins in the EGFR gene in lung adenocarcinomas.
This study explores the clinical and molecular characteristics, responses to targeted therapy, and survival of
patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas harboring
EGFR exon20ins. In this series, we report that advanced
lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins have an
incidence of 2%, which is similar to the incidence of 0.4%
to 0.9% reported in other published studies.11,12,18-21
These patients have clinical characteristics similar to
patients with more common sensitizing mutations in
EGFR, but demonstrate an objective response rate of
11% (0%-50%) and a short PFS of 2.4 months (2.3-2.5
months) with EGFR TKI therapy in published studies.
For the 11 patients with EGFR exon20ins treated with
erlotinib in this study, we report an objective response rate
of 27% and a median TTP of 2.5 months. A swimmer’s
plot of the treatment course of these patients (Fig. 3) demonstrates that in all cases except one (V769_D770insASV), treatment with erlotinib was received for a very
short period of time. Erlotinib therapy thus does not
appear to make a meaningful contribution to the total
treatments received. Moreover, even in patients with
EGFR exon20ins who achieved responses to erlotinib (3
of 11), those responses were short-lived in all but 1 case
(V769_D770insASV; Fig. 3). These findings are corroborated by small series of 2 to 25 patients with stage IV lung
adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins treated with
EGFR TKIs, in which the pooled median PFS was
approximately 2.4 months (Table 4).19-21 Thus, most
patients with EGFR exon20ins spend the majority of their
treatment time receiving chemotherapy. Therefore, we
advocate chemotherapy as standard first-line therapy for
patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas harboring
EGFR exon20ins.
When we examined the treatment history of patients
in these series, we noticed that patients with EGFR exon20ins had response rates to systemic chemotherapy comCancer

parable to the response rates of all patients with lung
adenocarcinomas, and specifically patients with EGFRmutant lung adenocarcinomas in published phase 3 studies.4,25 The median time on platinum doublet chemotherapy in our series was 6 months, which was similar to the
median PFS reported for the subset of patients with
EGFR-mutant lung cancers who received carboplatin and
paclitaxel in a phase 3 study.4 The response rates to standard systemic therapy for patients in our series were slightly
better than those for historical controls (all-comers and
those with sensitizing EGFR mutations). However, the
number of patients in our study is small, and precludes
any definitive conclusions.
Response rates to combination chemotherapy in
patients with lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins
have been reported in one previous publication, in which a
response rate of 58% is cited for combination chemotherapy in patients with available imaging (7 of 12).19 These
findings, together with the observations from the current
study which are not based on a prospective evaluation,
would need to be confirmed in a future study.
Our study is also one of the few to report the specific
amino acid sequences of EGFR exon20ins and the relationship with response to EGFR TKIs. Insertion sequence
variants have been described in previous studies, with up
to 13 sequence variants reported.17,18,20,26 This series
reports 17 variants of EGFR exon20ins, including 2 variants not previously described (D770_N771insGV and
H773_V774insY). We corroborate the novel funding
reported by Yasuda et al,17 who stated that the presence of
the EGFR exon20ins variant EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA
can predict for response to EGFR TKI therapy, thus indicating a distinct biologic behavior compared to other
EGFR exon20ins variants. In our report of 1 patient and
in their report of 2 patients whose tumors harbored the
FQEA variant, all 3 patients demonstrated partial
responses to erlotinib and improved OS.17,27 In our series,
the patient had a short-lived partial response and TTP on
erlotinib and an extended OS from the diagnosis of stage
IV disease. We identified 1 additional patient with an
EGFR exon20ins variant (V769_D770insASV), traditionally thought to confer resistance to EGFR TKIs, who
demonstrated a partial response to erlotinib, extended
TTP and OS. Therefore, certain EGFR exon20ins variants
may predict for response to EGFR TKIs, and these agents
should be considered as a treatment option for patients
whose tumors harbor these variants.
The presence of other concurrent molecular alterations may contribute to response or a lack of response to
EGFR TKIs. Patients with EGFR-mutant lung

adenocarcinomas whose tumors harbor concurrent PI3K
mutations have poorer outcomes and variable responses
to EGFR TKI.28-30 This phenomenon is also seen in other
molecularly driven subsets of lung adenocarcinomas such
as KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. In KRAS-mutant
tumors, the presence of a concurrent liver kinase B1 (serine/
threonine kinase 11) mutation portends a poor prognosis,
and may confer resistance to targeted therapies such as
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MEK) kinase inhibition.31-37 Two
of our 3 patients with concurrent EGFR exon20ins and
PI3K mutations had extended OS, and none of the 3
patients received an EGFR TKI. Further comprehensive
analysis is needed to understand how additional molecular
alterations may augment responses to EGFR TKIs.
Interestingly, despite a generally poor response to
targeted therapy, this study also demonstrates that
patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR
exon20ins had a median OS of 26 months. This was similar to the OS of 31 months for a cohort of patients
(n 5 258) who harbored sensitizing EGFR mutations
(exon19del and L858R), and it was consistent with a
pooled median OS of 9.5 to 48 months for patients with
stage IV lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins
(Table 4).12,18,19 The underlying reason for this improved
median OS is not currently known, and it may point to
unique disease biology of lung adenocarcinomas with
EGFR exon20ins.
Lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins comprise 2% of all lung adenocarcinomas, which is a larger
subset than those that harbor RET or ROS1 rearrangements, for which extensive therapeutic studies are underway. Similar efforts are needed to develop molecularly
targeted agents that specifically target EGFR exon20ins
because traditional EGFR TKIs are generally ineffective.
To date, 1 ongoing clinical trial has focused on this molecular subset and is assessing the utility of a heat shock protein 90 inhibitor (AUY992) in this population
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01854034).
In conclusion, stage IV lung adenocarcinomas with
EGFR exon20ins are a unique subset of lung adenocarcinomas. There are a large number of EGFR exon20ins variants, and we have identified and reported 2 new EGFR
exon20ins sequence variants in this study. Patients with
these tumors have clinical characteristics similar to those
of patients with lung adenocarcinomas that harbor EGFR
exon19del and L858R, and most insertion variants are resistant to erlotinib. We have corroborated previous findings that A763_Y764insFQEA is an EGFR exon20ins
variant that predicts for response to EGFR TKIs, and we

have identified a potential second sensitive variant,
V769_D770insASV, although previously published
reports suggest that this variant confers EGFR TKI resistance.12,17,19 Additional concurrent genetic alterations
may elucidate the differential response to EGFR TKIs
seen. For patients with other EGFR exon20ins sequence
variants, treatment with erlotinib as first-line therapy is
not recommended. We recommend that these patients be
treated with chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Interestingly, despite a generally poor response to erlotinib in
this study, the median OS of these patients was prolonged
and similar to that of patients whose tumors harbored sensitizing EGFR mutations. The underlying biology
accounting for this clinical behavior is currently
unknown. As we begin to further understand the functional significance of specific EGFR exon20ins, it is likely
that these aberrations will be further subdivided into
groups of insertion variants that may respond differently
to EGFR TKI therapy and have distinct clinical
behaviors.
