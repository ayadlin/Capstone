ABSTRACT
Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is often over-expressed in
soft tissue sarcoma (STS), a phase II trial using an EGFR inhibitor gefitinib showed
a low response rate. This study identified a new secondary resistance mechanism of
gefitinib in STS, and developed new strategies to improve the effectiveness of EGFR
inhibition particularly by blocking the STAT3 pathway.
We demonstrated that seven STS cell lines of diverse histological origin
showed resistance to gefitinib despite blockade of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR)
and downstream signal transducers (pAKT and pERK) in PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK
pathways. Gefitinib exposure was not associated with decrease in the ratio of pSTAT3/
pSTAT1. The relative STAT3 abundance and activation may be responsible for the drug
resistance. We therefore hypothesized that the addition of a STAT3 inhibitor could
overcome the STAT3 escape pathway.
We found that the addition of STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 to gefitinib achieved
synergistic anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in all three STS cell lines
examined. This was confirmed in a fibrosarcoma xenografted mouse model, where
the tumours from the combination group (418mm3) were significantly smaller than
those from untreated (1032mm3) or single drug (912 and 798mm3) groups.
Our findings may have clinical implications for optimising EGFR-targeted therapy
in STS.

INTRODUCTION

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is
activated following ligand binding to its extracellular
domain. This leads to phosphorylation of critical
tyrosine residues which activates signalling cascades and
induces gene transcription [3]. These include the RAS/
RAF/MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase)/ERK
(extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK, MAPK1),
the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PIK3CA)/
AKT (Protein kinase B)/mTOR (mammalian target of
rapamycin) and the JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal
transducers and activators of transcription) pathways.
The activation of these pathways stimulates cellular

Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a malignancy that
arises from transformed cells of mesenchymal origin. It
was estimated that about 12,020 new cases of STS were
diagnosed and 4,740 patients died from STS in the USA in
2014 [1]. Current treatment for STS relies upon aggressive
surgery, often in combination with radiotherapy and
chemotherapy. However, approximately half of all patients
will die of local recurrence or metastatic disease within
5 years [2]. Our current drug therapies have suboptimal
outcomes and new treatments are needed.

proliferation, growth, survival and mobility [4].
In epithelial tumours, EGFR is often over-expressed
and contributes to many cellular processes — cell cycle
progression, angiogenesis, metastases and anti-apoptosis
[5]. Therefore, EGFR is an important molecular target.
Its inhibition (such as gefitinib as the first selective
EGFR inhibitor) is now well established clinically in
several epithelial-origin tumours that display functional
dysregulation of this receptor [6, 7]. Those who respond
often have very prolonged benefit but do not lead to cure
[8]. Gefitinib selectively binds to the ATP binding pocket
of the phosphorylation sites on the EGFR tyrosine kinase
(TK) domain, thus blocking EGFR activation and EGFR
downstream signal transduction pathways.
We and others have reported that total EGFR
(tEGFR) was highly expressed in STS and significantly
associated with histological grade, but was not an
independent prognostic factor of survival [9, 10]. Our
unpublished data indicated that phosphorylated EGFR
(pEGFR) was an independent prognostic factor of survival
in STS patients. These findings indicated that suppressing
EGFR may greatly benefit sarcoma patients. However,
a phase II clinical trial in advanced synovial sarcomas
demonstrated that single agent gefitinib was unsatisfactory
with low response rates and short disease control [11].
Therefore, identification of the mechanism of gefitinib
resistance in STS and therapeutic combinations with both
a higher proportion of responders and potentially more
sustained benefit is needed.
In that light the interaction of the EGFR and JAK/
STAT pathways is of interest. The STATs exert diverse
actions on gene transcription and protein translation.
Upon activation, STATs form homo- or hetero-dimers,
translocate into the nucleus and bind to a variety of
targets [12]. There are two key STAT subtypes [13]:
STAT3, an oncogene which promotes cell survival and
proliferation, and STAT1, a tumour suppressor which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses.
The balance of STAT3/STAT1 regulates tumourigenesis
directly by modulating STAT-dependent target genes
or indirectly by controlling angiogenesis or antitumour
immune responses [12]. The oncogenic effect of STAT3
has led to intensive efforts to develop STAT3 inhibitors
[14]. STAT3 inhibitors have been shown to have antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in vitro and in vivo
in several cancers [15, 16] and have entered clinical trials
(NCI Glioblastoma Clinical Trial No. NCT00696176
and [17]). Recent studies have identified an association
between EGFR and STAT3. Activated wild-type EGFR
has been reported to physically associate and colocalize
with STAT3 in the nucleus leading to direct transcriptional
activation of the pro-oncogenic genes VEGF and iNOS
in breast cancer cells [18]. STAT3 forms a complex with
the oncoprotein EGFR type III variant (EGFRvIII) in
the nucleus and thereby mediates EGFRvIII-induced
glial transformation [19]. Given the insufficient clinical
efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy in sarcoma, our aim was
to investigate the mechanism of gefitinib resistance and
therapeutic combinations overcoming the resistance to
improve the efficacy of targeted-therapies in sarcoma.

RESULTS
Protein expression of EGFR and its downstream
signal transducers in a panel of seven STS cell
lines
Firstly, we analyzed the baseline levels of EGFR
and phosphorylation status in the absence/presence of
EGF by Western blot in seven STS cell lines representing
different histotypes (Figure 1 & Table 1). All were
positive in tEGFR expression at varying levels. EGF

stimulation induced pEGFR in all cell lines, while
pEGFR was undetectable/weak in the absence of EGF.
We also examined the expression of EGFR relevant
downstream signal transducers in these cell lines. It was
found that pAKT and pERK were detected in the majority
of cell lines in the absence of EGF and the levels were
all significantly increased following EGF stimulation
(mimicking closely the in vivo setting) (p < 0.05, Figure
1). The expression of pSTAT3 was at a high level in the
absence of EGF. Although EGF treatment had a mild
effect on upregulation of pSTAT3 levels in 778 and 449B
cell lines, this did not reach statistical significance (p >
0.05). Immunohistochemistry studies were also used to
better understand the pattern of these proteins in cells
(supplementary Figure S1). Both 778 and SW872 showed
very strong positive staining against total EGFR, AKT,
ERK and STAT3 as well as moderate positive staining for
phosphorylated proteins, except for relative weakness for
778 against pSTAT3, which is consistent with our Western
blot data.

C > T) occurred at an allele frequency of 0.73 and 0.09,
respectively. On mutation analysis of KRAS and BRAF
genes, all STS cell lines were found to be KRAS wild-type
at codons 12, 13 and 61. SW872, SW982 and GCT (3/7
STS cell lines) demonstrated the BRAF V600E mutation
(dbSNP:rs113488022, p.Val600Glu) (Table 1).

Therapeutic effect of gefitinib on seven STS cell
lines
The anti-proliferative effects of gefitinib on these
seven STS cell lines were determined by crystal violet
colorimetric assay. The mean IC50s were 13.17-32.82µM
(Table 1), while it was 0.018µM for PC9 (human
adenocarcinoma cell line), which served as positive
control. Using the standard previously described in a
similar lung cancer study (the sensitivity threshold of
gefitinib: IC50≤10µM) [20], our results indicated that all
STS cell lines were resistant to gefitinib mono therapy.
Consistently, anti-EGFR siRNA failed to exert an antiproliferative effect (Supplementary Figure S1).
In addition there was no significant correlation
between sensitivity (IC50) of STS cell lines to gefitinib and
EGF-stimulated pEGFR expression or tEGFR (Table 1, p
> 0.05) and IC50 values of gefitinib were not statistically
correlated with BRAF mutational status, indicating the
BRAF mutation may not activate in the resistance to
gefitinib in this panel of STS cell lines.

EGFR, KRAS and BRAF mutations in STS cell
lines
Seven STS cell lines were initially screened for
mutations in the TK domain (exons 18-24) of the EGFR
gene to rule out potential interference by the target’s
alteration. No rare sequence variants were detected.

Effect of gefitinib on the activation of EGFR and
its downstream pathways

Supplementary Figure S2A). The pAKT was significantly
inhibited by gefitinib treatment in the presence of EGF
in 778 and 449B (% expression at gefitinib/vehicle: 778:
13%, p < 0.001; 449B: 55%, p = 0.001; HT1080: 81%, p
= 0.09). The EGF-induced pERK was blocked (gefitinib/
vehicle: 16-93%) by gefitinib, with two cell lines (778:
p = 0.0007 and 449B: p = 0.0028) having statistical
significance.
We then investigated both STAT1 (tumour
suppressor) and STAT3 (oncoprotein) activity in JAK/
STAT pathway after gefitinib monotherapy (Figure 2B
and 2C). Gefitinib down-regulated both pSTAT1 and
pSTAT3 in all 3 cell lines, with statistical significance
in 778 and 449B (gefitinib/vehicle: pSTAT1: 32% and
17%, respectively; pSTAT3: 69% and 36%, all p≤0.05)
but a non-significant trend for HT1080 (95% and 99%, p
> 0.05). The ratio of pSTAT3/pSTAT1 was significantly
increased in 778 (2.5 folds, p = 0.006) and 449B (2.0

Although the EGF-induced pEGFR was completely
blocked by gefitinib monotherapy in all seven STS cell
lines (Figure 2A), they were all resistant to gefitinib,
suggesting the existence of at least one secondary
resistance mechanism.
To identify the potential escape pathways, we
examined the impact of EGFR inhibition on the activity
of two downstream pathways - PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/
ERK (which were reported to be both inactivated in the
gefitinib-sensitive carcinoma cell line A431 [21]), using
the STS cell lines with wild-type EGFR TK, KRAS and
BRAF genes (778, 449B and HT1080), so as to rule out
any interference from gene mutation and using EGF to
maximize downstream expression (Figure 2B and 2C,

95.5 and 14.5µM, respectively (sensitivity threshold
for S3I-201: IC50≤100µM). In subsequent combination
therapy study, these three cell lines were exposed to
gefitinib, S3I-201 or gefitinib plus S3I-201 at a fixed ratio
for 5 days and stained by crystal violet. The results were
analysed by CalcuSyn software (UK) as shown in Table
2. Our data showed that combination treatment achieved
synergistic anti-proliferation in all 3 STS cell lines
(Combination Index [CI] < 1; except 449B at IC90), with
the most synergistic effect in 778 (CI = 0.1-0.3; defined as
strong synergy). For the most synergistic cell line 778, the
drug reduction index (DRI; which measures how many
folds the dose of each drug may be reduced when drugs
were combined at the IC50 effect level compared with the
dose of drug alone) for gefitinib and S3I-201 was 5.97

folds, p = 0.025), and slightly increased in HT1080 (1.05
folds, p = 0.60), suggesting that gefitinib failed to decrease
the ratio of oncogene pSTAT3 versus tumour suppressor
pSTAT1. To confirm if the increased ratio of pSTAT3/
pSTAT1 induced the resistance of STS cell lines to EGFR
targeted therapy, we knocked down EGFR using antiEGFR siRNA. Consistently, siEGFR downregulated much
more pSTAT1 than pSTAT3 (showing increase of pSTAT3/
pSTAT1) and had no anti-proliferative effect (Figure 2D,
Supplementary Figure S2B and S2C).

and 15.74, respectively, suggesting that the combination
therapy using approximate 6-fold reduction of gefitinib
(4.74µM) and 16-fold reduction of S3I-201 (9.43µM)
can achieve the same anti-proliferative effect as a full
IC50 dose of either gefitinib or S3I-201 monotherapy. The
combination therapy also induced dose reduction potential
in 449B (Table 2, DRI = 4.15 and 10.56) and HT1080
(2.53 and 4.45), which indicated that 6.98µM gefitinib
plus 9.04µM S3I-201 in 449B or 1.44µM gefitinib plus
3.26µM S3I-201 in HT1080 could achieve IC50 effect.
The implication of this is that S3I-201 could overcome
the resistance of gefitinib monotherapy and bring the
needed concentration of gefitinib in the combination
therapy to achieve IC50 effect lower than the sensitivity
threshold (10µM) in all these three examined cell lines.
Figure 3 shows growth inhibition curves (A) following
combination compared to monotherapy, as well as doseeffect curves (B) and isobolograms (C) produced by
CalcuSyn. To better understand the synergism of the
combination use of these two drugs, we explored multiple
IC50 ratios (gefitinib:S3I-201 = 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 2:1 and 4:1)
and different sequences (concurrent, pre-treatment with
gefitinib for 24 hours or pre-treatment with S3I-201 for
24 hours) in 778 cell line. As shown in Supplementary
Table 1, the combination treatment produced synergism at
each ratio and sequence, while it appears the combination
therapy using gefitinib and S3I-201 at their equipotent
or relative lower doses of gefitinib produced stronger
synergism in 778 cell line, and the combination therapy
worked best in parallel.
Combination therapy was also investigated
by colony formation assay to observe long-term
growth inhibition effect. As shown in Figure 3D and
Supplementary Figure S3, synergistic anti-colony
formation was consistently achieved, showing that
gefitinib and S3I-201 in combination was significantly
more effective than single treatments in inhibiting sarcoma
cell colony-formation (all p < 0.05). In detail, the survival
fraction was 35% (778), 21% (449B) and 41% (HT1080)
for combination treatment, whereas it was 85% and 84%
(778), 57% and 73% (449B), 69% and 83% (HT1080) for
monotherapy.

vehicle control (all p < 0.005). Although gefitinib
monotherapy showed pSTAT3 inhibition to a certain
extent, combination treatment together with S3I-201
induced further down-regulation in 778, 449B and
HT1080 by 94%, 53% and 56%, respectively, compared
to gefitinib alone (all p < 0.001) (Figure 4B). Importantly,
the addition of S3I-201 to gefitinib dramatically perturbed
the ratios of pSTAT3/pSTAT1 in all of them compared to
vehicle control (combination/vehicle: HT1080: 52%, p =
0.0006; 449B: 47%, p = 0.24 and 778: 19%, p < 0.001) or
gefitinib alone (combination/gefitinib: HT1080: 49%, p =
0.027; 449B: 24%, p = 0.15 and 778: 7.7%, p = 0.0036)
(Figure 4C). Similarly, concurrent treatment with STAT3specific siRNA replacing S3I-201 further blocked STAT3
activation and decreased the ratio of pSTAT3/pSTAT1
(Figure 4D) supporting the specificity of S3I-201.
We further examined the alteration of protein
markers regulating apoptosis (Figure 4E and 4F) by
Western Blot and found that combination therapy
strongly increased the expression of apoptotic markers
including cleaved caspase (cCaspase)-3 (449B: 1.8 times;
HT1080: 11.8 times), cCaspase-7 (778: 1.4 times; 449B:
1.58 times) and cleaved Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase
(cPARP) (778: 3.34 times; 449B: 1.65 times; HT1080:
65.93 times) compared to gefitinib monotherapy. We
also examined the effect on survivin (a member of the
inhibitor of apoptosis family) and cyclin D1 (cell cycle
regulator). It was found that cyclin D1 was decreased after
combination treatment compared to gefitinib alone in all
three cell lines (combination/gefitinib: 449B: 35%; 778:
68%; HT1080: 52%) and survivin was also downregulated
in 778 (36%) and HT1080 (84%) but not in 449B (183%).
To confirm apoptotic effect by combination therapy, we
further detected apoptosis using Annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) binding by flow cytometry. Figure 4G shows
the combination therapy significantly enhanced apoptosis
compared to the vehicle control and single drug treatments
in wild-type STS cell lines.

To extend the investigation to in vivo, a human

wild-type STS cell lines, considering that neither 778
was tumorigenic in balb/c nude mice (our unpublished

combination therapy, we tested two small preliminary
studies with single drug S3I-201 or gefitinib. After
24 hours intramuscular inoculation of HT1080, mice
were randomly divided and treated by vehicle DMSO,
2.5mg/kg S3I-201 or 5mg/kg S3I-201, which was given

To investigate the molecular mechanisms that
underlie the observed synergism, STS cell lines were
treated with vehicle, gefitinib (10µM), S3I-201 (25µM) or
combination in the absence/presence of EGF. Whole cell
lysates were used for Western blot to detect STAT3 and
STAT1 (Figure 4A). Our data showed that combination
therapy significantly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation
by 56-96% compared to the corresponding untreated/

intraperitoneally. On day 9-10 after treatment, tumours of
about 4-5mm in diameter were formed in all groups. From
day 13 post-treatment, a significant inhibition of tumour
growth was found in S3I-201-treated groups at either
dose (p < 0.05, Figure 5A) compared to vehicle control
group. On Day 18, tumours from vehicle control group
reached approximately 15mm in diameter and 1140mm3
in volume, while tumours from treatment groups were
approximately 382 and 295mm3 (Vehicle/S3I-201 p <
0.005). Consistently with in vitro, as shown in Figure 5B,
there was no anti-sarcoma effect of gefitinib in vivo even
with doses of up to 20mg/kg (p > 0.05).
We next examined whether using S3I-201 could
also improve the effectiveness of gefitinib using our
mouse model in two independent combination therapy
experiments. Twenty-four hours post-inoculation of
HT1080, all mice were randomly divided into 4 groups
and treated with vehicle control (1% Tween 80), 1mg/kg
S3I-201 (intraperitoneally), 10mg/kg gefitinib (gavage)
or combination with 1mg/kg S3I-201 and 10mg/kg

gefitinib once daily. These two doses were specifically
selected so that their independent effect on tumour growth
inhibition would be modest and the concentrations were
clinically achievable [24-26]. The combination therapy
significantly enhanced the inhibition and delay of tumour
growth compared to vehicle control and monotherapy.
On day 18 post-treatment in the first experiment, the
tumours from combination therapy group (418mm3) were
significantly smaller than those from untreated (1032mm3)
and single drug treated (912 and 798mm3) groups (nonparametric and parametric methods: combination/vehicle
p < 0.001; combination/gefitinib monotherapy p < 0.001;
combination/S3I-201 p < 0.05) (Figure 5C). All mice
in vehicle and monotherapy groups were sacrificed on
day 18 because at least one tumour in its group reached
about 1000mm3, whilst all mice treated by combination
were continually treated with both drugs for a further
six days. To show the survival effect of combination
therapy, in the second experiment, each individual mouse
was sacrificed once its tumour reached about 1000mm3.

Kaplan-Meier survival curves (Figure 5D) shows that
combination therapy had significantly prolonged benefit
(mean of survival time [days]: vehicle: 18.8, gefitinib:
19.5, S3I-201: 19.3 and combination: 25.4; p = 0.0004).
Importantly, all treated mice tolerated S3I-201 and
gefitinib well, showing general good health with no
signs of distress. All groups showed no body weight loss
more than 20% and there was no significant difference
in body weight changes between untreated and treated
groups (p > 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S4). For drug
toxicity assessment, all tumours and organs (lung, heart,
liver, spleen and kidney) were harvested at the end points
and showed no macromorphological and histological
abnormalities (Supplementary Figure S5). To further
confirm whether toxicity was induced followed by the
mono- or combination therapy, the blood was collected
after sacrificing the mice to examine liver and kidney
functions. As shown in supplementary Figure S6, all four
serum biomarkers did not show significant changes after
mono- or combination therapy (p > 0.05), supporting that
the use of S3I-201 and gefitinib alone or in combination
was safe and well-tolerated by nude mice.

effect in all seven STS cell lines across different
histopathological subtypes, despite completely inhibiting
EGFR activation. This together with the limited activity in
a clinical trial using gefitinib in sarcoma [11] encouraged
us to explore the potential resistance mechanisms. The
sensitivity to EGFR TKIs has been positively associated
with activating mutations in EGFR gene such as deletion
mutations occurring around codon 746-750 in exon 19
and the substitution of leucine with arginine at codon 858
in exon 21 (L858) [29, 30]. In NSCLC, about 70-80%
patients with activating mutant EGFR gene were sensitive
to EGFR TKI, compared with only 10-20% response rate
in wild-type EGFR gene [31]. A poor response to EGFR
TKIs was also associated with EGFR-resistant mutations
such as exon 20 insertions or KRAS and BRAF mutations
[32-34]. In our mutation analysis, the lack of EGFR TK
activating mutation in our panel of STS cell lines indicated
that these cells may not be sensitive to EGFR-targeted
therapy. Our result is consistent with clinical reports. In
a cohort of 958 patients, only 2 of 38 samples from the
sarcoma subset were positive for EGFR mutation [35].
In a synovial sarcoma study, only 2 of 13 tissue samples
were positive for EGFR TK mutation, with no EGFR
amplification on FISH analysis [36] and a further study on
EGFR gene amplification from patients with endometrial
stromal sarcoma also showed 10/10 negative results
[37]. Additionally, gene mutations activating the EGFR
downstream signalling pathways may mediate the primary
and required resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. It has
been reported recently that KRAS and BRAF mutations
were negatively correlated with the response to targeting
EGFR treatment in lung and colorectal cancers [38, 39].
The KRAS mutation was not detected in our panel and
was consistent with previous studies [40] which showed
only 2 of 54 samples from patients with STS had KRAS
mutations. Similarly, a recent study found that none of the
samples from 108 sarcoma patients were BRAF mutation
positive [41]. Unexpectedly, we discovered that 3 STS
cell lines SW872, SW982 and GCT contained a BRAF
V600E mutation. We therefore chose to focus on BRAF
wild type cell lines as likely more representative of the
human situation. Other mutations (such as non-T790M
EGFR mutations D761Y, L747S and T854A, amplification
of c-Met, loss of PTEN, PIK3CA mutations and BIM BH3
deletion) have been reported to result in the resistance
to EGFR TKIs in some cancers [42]. However, the roles
of these mutations in sarcoma still remain unknown.
Similarly the tumour microenvironment is an increasing
area of focus in many tumour types but its role in
resistance in soft tissue sarcomas is not yet well studied.
An alternative explanation for the limited
therapeutic effect of gefitinib may be the existence of a
survival compensatory downstream pathway – JAK/STAT
escape pathway. The over-expression of pSTAT3 may
implicate pSTAT3 signalling as a potential escape pathway
against EGFR blockade [13]. The blockade of RAS/RAF/

DISCUSSION
Soft tissue sarcomas are rare, heterogeneous

common
chemotherapeutic agents offer limited benefit [27].
Despite multimodality treatment, overall sarcoma survival
rates remain unsatisfactory. Recently, the therapeutic focus
has been on targeting the biological mechanisms driving
tumourigenesis. Our unpublished studies on sarcoma
patients suggested that pEGFR was independently
associated with worse cancer specific survival. The
over-expression of pEGFR, pAKT, pERK and pSTAT3
were found in sarcoma patients unrelated to histology,
indicating EGFR-targeted therapy may benefit sarcoma
patients.
We report here, in the presence of EGF ligand,
which mimics closely the in vivo setting, pEGFR
along with its signal transducers (pAKT, pERK and
pSTAT3) [representing three downstream pathways]
were highly expressed in the majority of STS cell lines.
Furthermore, the observations that EGF stimulation
significantly increased protein expression of pAKT and
pERK, but not pSTAT3, indicated that both AKT and
ERK pathways in sarcomas may be mainly stimulated
by EGF/EGFR activation. Therefore, blocking EGFR
pathway may be a good treatment approach in STS, due
to the over-expression of activated EGFR and its activated
downstream signal transducers.
Use of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is
now a part of standard care in biologically appropriate
subsets in cancers of the lung [7], colon [28] and head and
neck [3]. In this study, we demonstrated gefitinib or antiEGFR siRNA alone failed to exert an anti-proliferative

ERK (pERK) and PI3K/AKT (pAKT) pathways has been
associated with gefitinib sensitivity in other cancer cell
lines and xenografts, such as NSCLC cell lines A549,
H460, PC9, A549 and QG56, which carry intrinsically
active ERK or AKT pathways [21, 43]. In the current study,
gefitinib treatment in our panel of STS cell lines with
wild-type EGFR TK, KRAS and BRAF genes (so as to
rule out any interference from relevant gene mutation) did
not inhibit proliferation despite complete inactivation of
EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, as well as inhibition
of representative signal transducers (pAKT and pERK) of
two main downstream pathways - RAS/RAF/ERK MAPK
and PI3K/AKT. In addition, we also found that gefitinib
did not effectively suppress the oncogenic member
(STAT3) of JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in failure to
decrease the ratio of pSTAT3/pSTAT1. JAK/STAT is the
third EGFR downstream signalling pathway. STAT protein
activation, dimerization and nuclear translocation are
induced after phosphorylation of JAK by growth factors,
cytokine receptors or non-receptor tyrosine kinases
signalling [13]. Therefore, JAK/STAT pathway may be
stimulated by HER-dependent signalling (EGFR-depedent
or HER2-dependent) or HER-independent signalling (IL6/gp130 or Src). Gefitinib as an EGFR specific inhibitor
may abrogate EGFR-dependant JAK/STAT activation,
but not other sources of stimulation. The incomplete
inhibition of JAK/STAT pathway may contribute to the
lack of response by STS cell lines to gefitinib. There are
seven members in STAT family; in particular, STAT1 and
STAT3 play important roles in cancer cells [13]. STAT3
promotes cancer proliferation and/or survival directly by
regulating target genes of tumour cells such as survivin,
cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL [13]. On the other hand, STAT1
exerts pro-apoptotic functions [12, 44]. Based on these
mostly opposite functions and their complex cross-talking,
we suggest that the ratio of pSTAT3/pSTAT1 may be a
better indicator of the comprehensive impact of JAK/
STAT signalling on regulating sarcoma cell growth than
any individual analysis of pSTAT3 or pSTAT1. This
comprehensive look at the biological balance between
individual STAT members has been reported in other
cancer situations [12, 45]. The imbalance in STAT3/
STAT1 favoured oncogenesis, and appeared to direct
tumourigenesis in the EGFR pathway [12, 45]. Our study
suggested that the increased/unchanged ratio of pSTAT3/
pSTAT1 from the JAK/STAT signalling pathway appeared
to contribute to the resistance of gefitinib in STS cell lines.
Despite its accepted use in NSCLC, gefitinib has
limitations as a single agent. One approach to improve
EGFR-targeted therapy in cancers was combination with
chemotherapy and radiation with variable success [3,
46-48]. In addition, due to complex cross-talk between
signalling pathways, examining the combination of
EGFR-targeted therapy with inhibition of other receptors
(HER2 and IGF-1R) or EGFR downstream signal
transducers (such as RAS, MAPK, AKT and MTOR) is an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

alternative strategy [46]. Given the multiple non-specific
genetic abnormalities that characterise sarcomas, complex
cross-talking between these abnormal signalling pathways
may contribute to resistance. We have demonstrated that
the addition of the STAT3 inhibitor to gefitinib resulted
in synergistic anti-proliferation and anti-colony formation
in all three STS cell lines examined (778, 449B and
HT1080). We specifically selected them considering
that they have wild-type EGFR TK, KRAS and BRAF
genes, so as to rule out any interference from relevant
gene mutation. The STAT3 inhibitor S31-201 selectively
blocked STAT3 activity via inhibition of STAT3
dimerization and SH2 domain-mediated interference of
DNA binding and transcriptional activity, while S3I-201
has minimal effect on STAT1. Western blot data showed
that the combination of gefitinib and S3I-201 or gefitinib
plus anti-STAT3 siRNA induced significant further
down-regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation and led to
substantial decrease in the ratio of pSTAT3/pSTAT1.
STAT family includes many members with variable
biological effect. For example STAT3 is an oncoprotein in
sarcoma, whilst STAT1 is a tumour suppressor. Therefore,
checking one member’s activity cannot reflect the balance
status between oncoproteins and tumour suppressors.
This explains why the phosphorylation status of STAT3
did not show a correlation with the effectiveness to this
combination therapy. The effectiveness to the combination
relates more to: 1) how much the ratio (pSTAT3/pSTAT1)
was increased by gefitinib monotherapy, as well as 2)
the sensitivity to STAT3 inhibitor. Several studies in
other solid cancers (lung and ovarian cancers) have also
indicated that STAT3 activation was associated with
EGFR resistance and blocking both EGFR and JAK/STAT
signalling pathways at different levels (JAK inhibitors
AZD1480 or P6, or siRNA against JAK or STAT3) have
shown synergistic therapeutic effects compared with
EGFR inhibition alone [49, 50]. We are the first to show
the synergism using a STAT3 inhibitor (S3I-201) and an
EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib) together in sarcoma. Although
we and others [49, 50] reported that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of STAT3 enhanced gefitinib sensitivity, other
STAT3 inhibitors including targeting SH2, DNA binding
or N-terminal domains need to be further investigated. In
order to make our studies clinically relevant, we chose the
gefitinib doses of 6.25, 10 and 20 mg/kg for our in vivo
studies, as these achieve similar therapeutic levels to those
seen clinically [24-26]. As expected gefitinib monotherapy
had no inhibitory effect on the fibrosarcoma xenografts in
this animal model. In contrast we showed a supra-additive
inhibitory effect on tumour growth and prolonged survival
benefit from the drug combination (S3I-201 plus gefitinib),
which prolonged survival for the combination group.
In summary, we demonstrated that all STS cell
lines examined in the study showed resistance to gefitinib
despite blockade of pEGFR and downstream signal
transducers (pAKT and pERK) in PI3K/AKT and RAS/

ERK pathways. Gefitinib exposure was not associated
with decrease in the ratio of pSTAT3/pSTAT1. The relative
STAT3 abundance and activation may be responsible for
the drug resistance. The addition of STAT3 inhibitor S3I201 to gefitinib achieved synergistic anti-proliferation
and pro-apoptotic effects in all three wild-type STS cell
lines and this is confirmed in a fibrosarcoma xenografted
mouse model, where the tumours from the combination
group were significantly smaller than those from untreated
or single drug groups.
The present study is the first in STS field to have
identified STAT3 signalling, in particular pSTA3/pSTAT1
as an escape mechanism for gefitinib monotherapy and
applied combination therapy to overcome the escape
signalling. These discoveries provide a positive signal
for proceeding to clinical trials using this combination in
sarcomas, which is currently a patient group with poor
outcomes and limited systemic therapy options.

DNA was extracted from all sarcoma cell lines using
the Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for KRAS and
BRAF mutations using bidirectional Sanger sequencing,
as described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods

analysis.

Crystal violet colorimetric assay (cell proliferation
assay)
Briefly, 24 hours after cells were seeded in 96-well
plates, vehicle or drugs (gefitinib: 5-40 µM; S3I-201: 6.25100 µM) were added into relevant wells. After required
time period (1-5 days post-treatment), cells were washed
with DPBS, stained with 0.5% crystal violet and incubated
with Elution solution (0.1M Sodium citrate + 100%
ethanol) for 30 minutes, followed by light absorbance at
540nm on a plate reader (Tecan; Austria).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture

Clonogenic survival assay for adherent cells

Five human STS cell lines (HT1080, SW684,
SW872, SW982 and GCT) were purchased from the
American Type of Cell Culture (Manassas, Virginia, USA).
Two human liposarcoma (449B and 778) were kindly
provided by Professor David Thomas (Peter MacCallum
Cancer Centre, Australia) and Dr Florence Pedeatour (Nice
University Hospital, France). Human adenocarcinoma cell
line PC9 was purchased from European Collection of Cell
Cultures (Wiltshire, UK). All cells were grown in RPMI1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
2mM L-glutamine and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin
and 50µg/ml streptomycin) at 37°C in a humidified
5% CO2 and 95% atmosphere. These cell lines were all
identified to be mycoplasma free and cell lineages were
validated using short tandem repeat profiling by CellBank
Australia.

Optimal numbers of single-cell suspensions were
seeded in duplicate into six-well plates. After 24 hours,
cells were treated with vehicle or drugs at required
concentrations (gefitinib: 10µM, S3I-201: 5µM) and
incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95%
atmosphere. Once colony-formation (1 colony ≥ 50
cells) was observed, cells were washed with DPBS and
stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Samples were imaged using a Molecular
Imager Gel Doc XR System and analysed by QuantityOne
software (Bio-rad, USA).

Transfection of siRNA

Western blot

An optimal siRNA (Qiagen) concentration (25
nM for siEGFR and 10 nM for siSTAT3) in HiPerFect
Transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used for transfection
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 48 hours
post-trasfection, cells were processed for Western blot or
proliferation assay.

Cells were harvested after 24 hours treatment, and
total proteins were extracted and measured using Western
blot with our standard procedures [22] and as described in
the Supplementary Materials and Methods - Western blot.
EGFR inhibitor gefitinib and STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201
(NSC 74859) were purchased from Euroasian chemicals
(India) and Merck (Germany), respectively.

Combination therapy
Based on Chou and Talalay method for combination
therapy [51], four groups (vehicle, gefitinib, S3I-201, and
gefitinib plus S3I-201) were used for at least duplicate

Statistical analysis
Quantitative data are presented as means ± standard
deviation (SD) of all replicates. The correlation between
IC50 of gefitinib and protein expression and BRAF mutation
status were examined by Pearson’s correlation coefficient
methods. The difference between matched or independent
groups was analysed using paired or unpaired Student’s
t-test. Protein expression or colony formation in different
treatment groups was analysed using ANOVA first.
Significant ANOVA group was further analysed by a posthoc Bonferroni test. The difference of tumour volumes
between groups was analysed using both non-parametric
(Kruskal-Wallies test and Tamhane Post Hoc Test) and
parametric methods (oneway ANOVA and Bonferroni Post
Hoc Test). Statistical analysis was performed using IBM
Statistics 22 (IBM SPSS, USA). The p-values (2-tailed) of
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
