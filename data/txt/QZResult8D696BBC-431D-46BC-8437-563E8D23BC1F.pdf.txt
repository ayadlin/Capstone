Whole Genome Analysis Informs Breast Cancer Response to
Aromatase Inhibition
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.

Summary
Author Manuscript

To correlate the variable clinical features of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer with
somatic alterations, we studied pre-treatment tumour biopsies accrued from patients in a study of
neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy by massively parallel sequencing and analysis.
Eighteen significantly mutated genes were identified, including five genes (RUNX1, CBFB,
MYH9, MLL3 and SF3B1) previously linked to hematopoietic disorders. Mutant MAP3K1 was
associated with Luminal A status, low grade histology and low proliferation rates whereas mutant
TP53 associated with the opposite pattern. Moreover, mutant GATA3 correlated with suppression
of proliferation upon AI treatment. Pathway analysis demonstrated mutations in MAP2K4, a
MAP3K1 substrate, produced similar perturbations as MAP3K1 loss. Distinct phenotypes in ER+
breast cancer are associated with specific patterns of somatic mutations that map into cellular
pathways linked to tumor biology but most recurrent mutations are relatively infrequent.
Prospective clinical trials based on these findings will require comprehensive genome sequencing.

Introduction
Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer exhibits highly variable prognosis,
histological growth patterns and treatment outcomes. Neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI)
treatment trials provide an opportunity to document ER+ breast cancer phenotypes in a
setting where sample acquisition is facile, prospective consent for genomic analysis can be
obtained and responsiveness to estrogen deprivation therapy is documented1. We therefore
conducted massively parallel sequencing (MPS) on 77 samples accrued from two
neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor clinical trials2,3. Forty-six cases underwent whole genome

sequencing (WGS) and 31 cases, exome sequencing, followed by extensive analysis for
somatic alterations and their association with aromatase inhibitor response. Case selection
for discovery was based on the tumour Ki67 level in the surgical specimen, since high
cellular proliferation despite AI treatment identifies poor prognosis tumours exhibiting
estrogen-independent growth4 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Twenty-nine samples displayed Ki67
above 10% (“AI resistant tumours”, median Ki67 21%, range 10.3–80%) and 48 were at or
below 10% (“AI sensitive tumours”, median Ki67=1.2%, range 0–8%), Cases were also
classified as luminal A or B by gene expression profiling3. We subsequently examined
interactions between Ki67 biomarker change, histological categories, intrinsic subtype and
mutation status in selected recurrently mutated genes in 310 cases overall. Pathway analysis
was applied to contrast the signaling perturbations in AI sensitive versus resistant tumors.

The mutation landscape of luminal-type breast cancer

Author Manuscript

Using paired-end MPS, 46 tumour and normal genomes were sequenced to at least 30-fold
and 25-fold haploid coverage, respectively, with diploid coverage of at least 95% based on
concordance with SNP array data (Supplementary Table 1). Candidate somatic events were
identified using multiple algorithms,5,6 then were verified by hybridization capture-based
validation that targeted all putative somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small
insertions/deletions (indels) that overlap coding exons, splice sites, and RNA genes (tier 1),
high-confidence SNVs and indels in non-coding conserved or regulatory regions (tier 2), as
well as non-repetitive regions of the human genome (tier 3). In addition somatic structural
variants (SVs) and germline SVs that potentially affect coding sequences (Supplementary
Information) were assessed. Digital sequencing data from captured target DNAs from the 46
tumour and normal pairs (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Information)
confirmed 81,858 mutations (point mutations and indels) and 773 somatic SVs. The average
numbers of somatic mutations and SVs were 1,780 (range 44 – 11,619) and 16.8 (range 0 –
178) per case, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). Tier 1 point mutations and small indels
predicted for all 46 cases also were validated using both 454 and Illumina sequencing
(Supplementary Information). BRC25 was a clear outlier with only 44 validated tier 1–3
mutations at low allele frequencies (ranging from 5% to 26.8%). Likely, this sample had low
tumour content despite histopathology assessment, but the data are included to avoid bias.

Author Manuscript

The overall mutation rate was 1.18 validated mutations per Mbp (tier 1:1.05; tier 2: 1.14; tier
3: 1.20). The mutation rate for tier 1 was higher than observed for AML (0.18–0.23)6,7 but
lower than reported for hepatocellular carcinoma (1.85)8, malignant melanoma (6.65)9 and
lung cancers (3.05–8.93)10,11 (Supplementary Table 4). The background mutation rate
(BMR) across the 21 AI resistant tumours was 1.62 per Mbp, nearly twice that of the 25 AI
sensitive tumours at 0.824 per Mbp (P = 0.02, one-sided t-test). A trend for more somatic
structural variations in the AI resistant group also was observed, as the validated somatic
structural variation frequency in the 21 AI resistant tumour genomes was 21.69 versus an
average of 12.76 in 25 AI sensitive tumours (P = 0.16, one-sided t-test) (Fig. 1). If 10 TP53
mutated cases were excluded, the BMR still tended to be higher in the AI resistant group
(P=0.08). To demonstrate a single tumour core biopsy produced representative genomic

data, whole genome sequencing of two pre-treatment biopsies was conducted for 5 of the 46
cases. The frequency of mutations in the paired specimens showed high concordance in all
cases (correlation co-efficiency ranged from 0.74 to 0.95) (Supplementary Fig. 2) and a
somatic mutation was infrequently detected in only one of the two samples (4.65% overall).
Significantly mutated genes in luminal-type breast cancer

Author Manuscript

The discovery effort was extended by studying 31 additional cases by exome sequencing,
producing an additional 1,371 tier 1 mutations. In total the 77 cases yielded 3,355 tier 1
somatic mutations, including 3,208 point mutations, 1 dinucleotide mutation, and 146 indels,
ranging from 1 to 28 nucleotides. The point mutations included 733 silent, 2,145 missense,
178 nonsense, 6 read-through, 69 splice-site mutations, and 77 in RNA genes
(Supplementary Table 5). Of 2,145 missense mutations, 1,551 were predicted to be
deleterious by SIFT14 and/or PolyPhen15. The MuSiC package (Dees et al., manuscript
submitted) was applied to determine the significance of the difference between observed
versus expected mutation events in each gene based on the background mutation rate. This
identified 18 significantly mutated genes (SMG) with a convolution FDR < 0.26 (Table 1
and Supplementary Table 6). The list contains genes previously identified as mutated in
breast cancer (PIK3CA12, TP5313, GATA314, CDH115, RB116, MLL317, MAP3K118 and
CDKN1B19) as well as genes not previously observed in clinical breast cancer samples,
including TBX3, RUNX1, LDLRAP1, STNM2, MYH9, AGTR2, STMN2, SF3B1, and CBFB.

Thirteen mutations (3 nonsense, 6 frame-shift indels, 2 in-frame deletions and 2 missense)
were identified in MAP3K1 (Table 1 and Fig. 2), a serine/threonine kinase that activates the
ERK and JNK kinase pathways through phosphorylation of MAP2K1 and MAP2K420. Of
interest, a missense (S184L) and a splice-region mutation (e2+3 likely affecting splicing) in
MAP2K4 were observed in two tumours with no MAP3K1 mutation (Fig. 2). Single
nonsynonymous mutations in MAP3K12, MAP3K4, MAP4K3, MAP4K4, MAPK15, and
MAPK3 also were detected (Supplementary Table 5). TBX3 harbored three small indels (one
insertion and two deletions). TBX3 affects expansion of breast cancer stem-like cells through
regulation of FGFR21. Two truncating mutations in the tumor suppressor CDKN1B were
identified19. Four missense RUNX1 mutations were observed, with three in the RUNT
domain clustered within the 8 amino acid putative ATP-binding site (R166Q, G168E, and
R169K). RUNX1 is a transcription factor affected by mutation and translocation in the M2
subtype of AML22 and is implicated in tethering ER to promoters independently of estrogen
response elements23. Two mutations (N104S and N140*) also were identified in CBFB, the
binding partner of RUNX1. Additional mutations included 3 missense (2 K700E and 1
K666Q), in SF3B1, a splicing factor implicated in MDS24 and CLL25. One missense and
one nonsense mutation, and two indels, were found in the MYH9 gene involved hereditary
macrothrombocytopenia26 as well being observed in an ALK translocation in anaplastic
large cell lymphoma27.
We also identified three SMGs (LDLRAP1, AGTR2, and STMN2), not previously implicated
in cancer. A missense and a nonsense mutation were observed in LDLRAP1, a gene
associated with familial hypercholesterolemia28. AGTR2, angiotensin II receptor type 2
harbored two missense mutations (V184I and R251H). Angiotensin signaling and ER

intersect in models of tissue fibrosis29. STMN2, a gene activated by JNK family kinases30,31
and therefore regulated by MAP3K1 and MAP2K4, harbored one frameshift deletion and one
missense mutation. Three deletions and one point mutation (Supplementary Fig. 3) were
identified in a large, infrequently spliced non-coding (lnc) RNA gene, MALAT1 (metastasis
associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), that regulates alternative splicing by
modulating the phosphorylation of SR splicing factor32. Translocations and point mutations
of MALAT1 have been reported in sarcoma33 and colorectal cancer cell lines34. Five
additional MALAT1 mutations were found in the recurrent screening set (Supplementary
Table 5d). The locations of these mutations clustered in a region of species homology (F1
and 2 domains) that could mediate interactions with SRSF132 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Noncoding mutation clusters were found in ATR, GPR126, and NRG3 (Supplementary
Information and Supplementary Table 7).

Correlations between mutations, AI response biomarkers, and histology

To study clinical correlations, mutation recurrence screening was conducted on an additional
240 cases (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 1). By combining WGS, exome,
and recurrence screening data, we determined the mutation frequency in PIK3CA to be
41.3% (131 of 317 tumours) (Supplementary Table 5a-d and Supplementary Fig. 3). TP53
was mutated in 51 of 317 tumours (16.1%) (Supplementary Table 5a-d and Supplementary
Fig. 3). Additionally, 52 nonsynonymous MAP3K1 mutations in 39 tumours and 10
mutations in its substrate MAP2K4 were observed representing a combined case frequency
of 15.5% (Supplementary Table 5a-d and Fig. 3). Of note, 52 of the 62 non-silent mutations
in MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 were scattered indels or other protein truncating events strongly
suggesting functional inactivation. In addition, 13 tumours harbored two non-silent
MAP3K1 mutations, indicative of bi-allelic loss and reinforcing the conclusion that this gene
is a tumour suppressor. Twenty nine tumours harboured a total of 30 mutations in GATA3,
consisting of 25 truncation events, one in-frame insertion, and 4 missense mutations
including 3 recurrent mutations at M294K (Supplementary Table 5a-d and Supplementary
Fig. 3). BRC8 harboured a chromosome 10 deletion that includes GATA3. CDH1 mutation
data were available for 169 samples and, as expected, its mutation status was strongly
associated with lobular breast cancer15 (Table 2). We applied a permutation-based approach
in MuSiC (Dees et al., submitted) to ascertain relationships between mutated genes.
Negative correlations were found between mutations in gene pairs such as GATA3 and
PIK3CA (P = 0.0026), CDH1 and GATA3 (P = 0.015), and CDH1 and TP53 (P = 0.022).
MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 mutations were mutually exclusive, albeit without reaching
statistical significance (P = 0.3). In contrast, a positive correlation between MAP3K1/
MAP2K4 and PIK3CA mutations was highly significant (P = 0.0002) (Supplementary Table
9).
Two independent mutation data sets from these clinical trial samples were analyzed
separately and then in combination, with a false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P value to
gauge the overall strength and consistency of genotype/phenotype relationships (Table 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 1). TP53 mutations in both data sets correlated with significantly higher
Ki67 levels, both at baseline (P = 0.0003) and at surgery (P = 0.001). Furthermore, TP53
mutations were significantly enriched in luminal B tumours (P = 0.04) and in higher

histological grade tumours (P = 0.02). In contrast, MAP3K1 mutations were more frequent
in luminal A tumours (P = 0.02), in grade 1 tumours (P=0.005) and in tumours with lower
Ki67 at baseline (P = 0.001) with consistent findings across both data sets. GATA3 mutation
did not influence baseline Ki67 levels but was enriched in samples exhibiting greater
percentage Ki67 decline (P = 0.01). This finding requires further verification because it was
significant in SET1 (uncorrected P value 0.003) but was a marginal finding in SET2 (P =
0.08). However, it suggests GATA3 mutation may be a positive predictive marker for AI
response.
Structural variation and DNA repair mechanisms

Author Manuscript

Analysis of copy number alterations (CNAs) revealed arm-level gains for 1q, 5p, 8q, 16p,
17q, 20p, and 20q and arm-level losses for 1p, 8p, 16q, and 17p in the 46 WGS tumour
genomes (Supplementary Fig. 5). A total of 773 SVs (579 deletions, 189 translocations, and
5 inversions) identified by WGS were validated as somatic in 46 breast cancer genomes by
capture validation. No recurrent translocations were detected but six in-frame fusion genes
were validated by RT-PCR (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Tables 10–13).
Seven tumours had multiple complex translocations with breakpoints suggestive of a
catastrophic mitotic event (“chromothripsis”; Supplementary Table 11). Analysis of the SV
genomic breakpoints shows the spectra of putative chromothripsis-related events are the
same as seen for other somatic events, with the majority of SVs arising from nonhomologous end-joining. We classified somatic (mitotic) and germline (meiotic) SVs into
four groups: variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), non-allelic homologous
recombination (NAHR), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), according to criteria described in Supplementary
Information. The fraction of each classification is shown for germline and somatic (mitotic)
events (Supplementary Table 14). There were significantly more somatic NHEJ events in
tumour genomes than the other three types (P < 2.2e-16).
Pathways in luminal breast cancer relevant to AI response

Author Manuscript

Pathscan 35 analysis (Supplementary Table 15 and Supplementary Information) indicated
that somatic mutations detected in the 77 discovery cases affect a number of pathways
including caspase cascade/apoptosis, ErbB signaling, Akt/PI3K/mTOR signaling, TP53/RB
signaling, and MAPK/JNK pathways (Figure 4a). To discern the pathways relevant to AI
sensitivity, we conducted separate pathway analyses for AI sensitive versus AI resistant
tumors. While the majority of top altered pathways (FDR <= 0.15) in each group are shared,
several pathways were enriched in the AI resistant group, including the TP53 signaling
pathway, DNA replication, and mismatch repair. Specifically, 38% of the AI resistant group
(11 of 29 tumours) have mutations in the TP53 pathway with three having double or triple
hits involving TP53, ATR, APAF1, or THBS1. In contrast, only 16.6% (8 of 48 tumours) of
the Ki67 low group had mutations in the TP53 signaling pathway, each with only a single hit
in genes TP53, ATR, CCNE2, or IGF1. (Supplementary Table 16).
GeneGo pathway analysis of MetaCore interacting network objects was used to identify
genes in the 77 luminal breast cancers with low-frequency mutations that cluster into
pathway maps. Eight networks assembled from significant maps encompassed mutations

from 71 (92%) of the tumours (Fig. 4b). Many of the network objects shared pathways with
SMGs such as TP53, MAP3K1, PIK3CA, and CDH1. GeneGo analysis also revealed that
several genes with low-frequency mutations were actually subunits of complexes, resulting
in higher mutation rates for that object, e.g., the condensin complex (4 mutations in 4 genes)
and the MRN complex (4 mutations on 3 genes). Several pathways without multiple SMGs,
such as the apoptotic cascade, calcium/phospholipase signaling, and G-protein coupled
receptors, were significantly affected by low-frequency mutations. Grouping tumours by
SMGs and pathway mutation status showed that while 55 (71%) of the tumours contained
SMGs in significant pathways, an additional 16 (21%) contained only non-SMGs in these
pathways. Thus, tumours without a given SMG often had other mutations in the same
relevant pathway (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 17, and
Supplementary Information).

Author Manuscript

We also applied PARADIGM36 to infer pathway-informed gene activities using gene
expression and copy number data to identify several “hubs” of activity (Supplementary Fig.
7, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Information). As expected, ESR1 and FOXA1
were among the hubs activated cohort-wide while other hubs exhibited high but differential
changes in AI resistant tumours including C-MYC, FOXM1, and C-MYB (Supplementary
Fig. 8). The concordance among the 104 MetaCore maps from GeneGo analysis described
above is significant, with 75 (72%) matching one of the PARADIGM subnetworks at the
0.05 significance level after multiple test correction (P < 4.4×10−6; Bonferroni-adjusted
hypergeometric test) (Supplementary Fig. 9). We identified significant subnetworks
associated with Ki67 biomarker status (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplemental
Information) involving transcription factors controlling large regulons.

Author Manuscript

The PARADIGM-inferred pathway signatures were further used to derive a map of the
genetic mechanisms that may underlie treatment response. A sub-network was constructed
in which interactions were retained only if they connected two features with higher than
average absolute association with Ki67 biomarker status (Supplementary Fig. 10 and 11 and
Supplemental Information). Consistent with the PathScan results, among the largest of the
hubs in the identified network were a central DNA Damage hub with the second highest
connectivity (55 regulatory interactions; 1% of the network) and TP53 with the 14th highest
connectivity (26 connections; 0.5% of the network). Additional highly connected hubs
identified in order of connectivity were MYC with 79 connections (1.4%), FYN with 45
(0.8%), MAPK3 with 43, JUN with 40, HDAC1 with 40, SHC1 with 39, and HIF1A/ARNT
complex with 39 (Supplementary Fig. 11).

To identify higher-level connections between mutations and clinical features, we compared
the samples based on pathway-derived signatures. For each clinical attribute and each SMG,
we dichotomized the discovery samples into a positive and negative group for pair-wise
comparisons (see details in Supplementary Information). We then computed all pair-wise
Pearson correlations between pathway signatures and clustered the resulting correlations
(Fig. 5). The entire process was repeated using validated mutations and signatures derived
from the validation set (Supplementary Fig. 12). In line with expectation, PIK3CA,
MAP3K1, MAP2K4, and low risk preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) scores
(PEPI is an index of recurrence risk post neoadjuvant AI therapy4) cluster with the luminal

A subtypes and with each other, and are supported by the validation set analysis. The
luminal B-like signatures included TP53, RB1, RUNX1 and MALAT1, which also associated
with other poor outcome features such as high baseline and surgical Ki67 levels, high grade
histology and high PEPI scores. The TP53 and MALAT1 associations in the discovery set
also were supported by the validation set analysis.
Druggable gene analysis
We defined mutations in druggable tyrosine kinase domains including in ERBB2 (a V777L
and a 755–759 LRENT in frame deletion homologous to gefitinib-activating EGFR mutations
in lung cancer 37), as well as in DDR1 (A829V, R611C), DDR2 (E583D), CSF1R (D735H,
M875L), and PDGFRA (E924K). In addition, pleckstrin homology domain mutations were
observed in AKT1 (C77F) and AKT2 (S11F) and a kinase domain mutation was identified in
RPS6KB1 (S375F) (Supplementary Table 18).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The low frequency of many SMGs presents an enormous challenge for correlative analysis,
but several statistically significant patterns were identified, including the relationship
between MAP3K1 mutation, luminal A subtype, low tumour grade and low Ki67
proliferation index. On this basis, for patients with MAP3K1 mutant luminal tumors,
neoadjuvant AI could provide a favorable option. In contrast, tumors with TP53 mutation,
which are mostly AI resistant, would be more appropriately treated with other modalities.
MAP3K1 activates the ERK family, thus, loss of ERK signaling could explain the indolent
nature of MAP3K1 deficient tumours20. However, MAP3K1 also activates JNK through
MAP2K4, which also can be mutated38. Loss of JNK signaling produces a defect in
apoptosis in response to stress, which would hypothetically explain why these mutations
accumulate39,40. PIK3CA harbored the most mutations (41.3%) but was neither associated
with clinical nor Ki67 response, confirming our earlier report41. However, the positive
association between MAP3K1/MAP2K4 mutations and PIK3CA mutation at both the
mutation and pathway levels suggests cooperativity (Fig. 4a).

Author Manuscript

The finding of multiple SMGs linked previously to benign and malignant haematopoeitic
disorders suggests that breast cancer, like leukemia, can be viewed as a stem cell disorder
that produces indolent or aggressive tumours that display varying phenotypes depending on
differentiation blocks generated by different mutation repertoires 42. While only MLL3
showed statistical significance in the analysis of 46 WGS cases, multiple mutations in genes
related to histone modification and chromatin remodeling are worth noting (Supplementary
Table 19). An array of coding mutations and structural variations was discovered in
methyltransferases (MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, and MLL5), demethyltransferases (KDM6A,
KDM4A, KDM5B, and KDM5C), and acetyltransferases (MYST1, MYST3, and MYST4).
Furthermore, our analysis identified several adenine-thymine (AT)–rich interactive domain–
containing protein genes (ARID1A, ARID2, ARID3B, and ARID4B) that harbored mutations
and large deletions, reinforcing the role of members from the SNF/SWI family in breast
cancer.

Pathway analysis enables the evaluation of mutations with low recurrence frequency where
statistical comparisons conventionally are underpowered. For example, the eight samples
with MAP2K4 mutations were sufficient to derive a reliable pathway-based gene signature
in PARADIGM that aligns with MAP3K1. This approach also pointed to a putative
connection between MALAT1 and the TP53 pathway. Finally, we provide evidence that
transcriptional associations to Ki67 response reside in a connected network under the control
of several key “hub” genes including MYC, FYN, and MAP kinases among others. Targeting
these hubs in resistant tumours could produce therapeutic advances. In conclusion, the
genomic information derived from unbiased sequencing is a logical new starting point for
clinical investigation, where the mutation status of an individual patient is determined in
advance and treatment decisions are driven by therapeutic hypotheses that stem from
knowledge of the genomic sequence and its possible consequences. However, the accrual of
large numbers of patients and the use of comprehensive sequencing and gene expression
approaches will be required because of the extreme genomic heterogeneity documented by
this investigation.

Methods summary

Clinical trial samples were accessed from the preoperative letrozole phase 2 study
(NCT00084396) 2 that investigated effect of letrozole for 16 to 24 weeks on surgical
outcomes and from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1031
study (NCT00265759) 3 that compared anastrozole with exemestane or letrozole for 16 to 18
weeks before surgery (REMARK flow charts, supplementary Fig. 1). Baseline snap-frozen
biopsy samples with greater than 70% tumour content (by nuclei) underwent DNA
extraction and were paired with a peripheral blood DNA sample. Two formalin-fixed
biopsies were obtained at baseline and at surgery, and were used to conduct ER and Ki67
immunohistochemistry as previously published4. Paired end Illumina reads from tumours
and normals were aligned to NCBI build36 using BWA. Somatic point mutations were
identified using SomaticSniper43, and indels were identified by combining results from a
modified version of the Samtools indel caller (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/), GATK, and
Pindel. Structural variations were identified using BreakDancer5 and SquareDancer
(unpublished). All putative somatic events found in 46 cases were validated by targeted
custom capture arrays (Nimblegen)/Illumina sequencing and all tier 1 mutations for 46 WGS
cases also were validated using PCR/454 sequencing. All statistical analyses, including
SMG, mutation relation and clinical correlation were done using the MuSiC package
(manuscript submitted) and/or by standard statistical tests (Supplementary Information).
Pathway analysis was performed with PathScan, GeneGo Metacore (http://
www.genego.com/metacore.php), and PARADIGM. A complete description of the materials
and methods used to generate this data set and results is provided in the Supplementary
Methods section.

This article is dedicated to the memory of Evelyn Lauder in recognition of her tireless efforts to eradicate breast
cancer. We would like to thank the participating patients and their families, clinical investigators and their support
staff and the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program at the US National Cancer Institute. We would like to
acknowledge the efforts of the following people and groups at The Genome Institute for their contributions to this
manuscript: the Analysis Pipeline group for developing the automated analysis pipelines that generated alignments
and somatic variants; the LIMS group for developing tools to manage validation array ordering, capture, and
sequencing, and Joelle Veizer and Heather Schmidt for structural variant and recurrent screening analyses. We
thank the many members of the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis for support, and the
committed members of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and their patients for contributing
samples to the Z1031 trial. This work was funded by grants to R.K.W. (Richard K. Wilson) from the National
Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI U54 HG003079), grants to M.J.E. (Matthew J. Ellis) from the National

Figure 1. Genome-wide somatic mutations

Circos plots44 indicate validated somatic mutations comprising tier 1 point mutations and
indels, genome-wide copy number alterations, and structural rearrangements in six
representative genomes. Three on-treatment Ki67 lesser than or at 10% (top panel: BRC15,
BRC17, and BRC22) and three on-treatment Ki67 greater than 10% (bottom panel: BRC44,
BRC47, and BRC50) cases are shown. Significantly mutated genes are highlighted in red.
No purity-based copy number corrections were used for plotting copy number.

Figure 4. Key cancer pathway components altered in luminal breast tumours

Author Manuscript

(a) Only genetic alterations identified in 46 WGS cases were shown. Alterations were
discovered in key genes in the TP53/RB, MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Genes colored
blue and red are predicted to be functionally inactivated and activated, respectively, through
focused mutations including point mutations and small indels (M), copy number deletions
(C), or other structural changes (S) that affect the gene. The inter-connectedness of this
network (several pathways) shows that there are many different ways to perturb a pathway.
(b) Eight interaction networks from canonical maps are significantly over-represented by
mutations in 77 luminal breast tumours (46 WGS and 31 exome cases). In the concentric
circle diagram, tumors are arranged as radial spokes and categorized by their mutation status
in each network (concentric ring color) and SMG mutation status (black dots). Tumor
classification by pathway analysis shows many tumors unaffected by a given SMG often
harbor other mutations in the same network. For full annotation, see Supplementary
Information and Supplementary Fig. 6.

Figure 5. Pathway signatures reveal connections between mutations and clinical outcomes

PARADIGM-based pathway signatures were derived for tumour feature dichotomies
including mutation driven gene signatures (mutant vs. non-mutant), histopathology type
(lobular vs. ductal), preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score (PEPI=0
favorable vs. PEPI>0 unfavorable), PAM50 Luminal A subtype (LumA vs. LumB) and the
reverse (LumB vs. LumA), histopathology grade (grades II&III vs. I), baseline Ki67 levels
(>=14% vs. <14%), and end-of-treatment Ki67 levels (>=10% vs. <10%) and overall PEPI
score (higher than mean unfavorable vs. lower than mean favorable). Pearson correlations
were computed between all pair-wise signatures; positive correlations, red; negative
correlations, blue; column features ordered identically as rows. Correlation analysis on the
77 samples in the discovery set is shown.
