Cdk2 is Required for Breast Cancer Mediated by the
Low-Molecular-Weight Isoform of Cyclin E

Abstract
Cyclin E activates Cdk2, controls centrosome duplication, and regulates histone gene transcription. Cyclin E is
deregulated in cancer and appears as low-molecular-weight (LMW) isoforms that correlate strongly with
decreased survival in breast cancer patients. Transgenic mice overexpressing LMW-cyclin E have increased
incidence of mammary tumors and distant metastasis when compared with mice that had full-length cyclin E. To
specifically test the requirement for Cdk2 in LMW-cyclin E–mediated mammary tumorigenesis, we generated
transgenic mice, which expressed LMW-cyclin E in a Cdk2-deficient background. We found that mammary gland
development proceeds relatively normally in these animals, indicating that Cdk2 kinase activity is largely
dispensable for this process. However, Cdk2-deficient mice were completely resistant to LMW-cyclin E–mediated
mammary tumors. Cdk2 wild-type or heterozygous mice succumbed to mammary tumors with mean latencies of
16 and 19.5 months, respectively, but Cdk2 nullizygous littermates did not display tumors through 24 months.
Similarly, continuous administration of two different Cdk inhibitors significantly delayed LMW-cyclin E–induced
mammary tumor progression. Triple transgenic mice generated in a p53 heterozygous background also displayed
no tumors. Finally, we found that Cdk2 silencing induced cell death in LMW-overexpressing breast cancer cell
lines, but not in cell lines lacking LMW expression. Our findings establish a requirement for Cdk2 in LMW-cyclin
E–mediated mammary tumorigenesis, arguing that human breast tumors overexpressing LMW-cyclin E are
prime candidates for anti-Cdk2 therapy. Cancer Res; 71(9); 3377–86. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Progression through the cell cycle is driven by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) whose catalytic activity and substrate
specificity depend on their association with regulatory subunits called cyclins. Altered expression of cyclins can drive
aberrant proliferation in cancer (1). Cyclin E is of particular
importance, as its expression is deregulated in many cancers,
most notably breast cancer (2–4). One mode of deregulation of
cyclin E expression is the generation of low-molecular-weight
(LMW) isoforms following cleavage of full-length cyclin E by an
elastase-like protease (5). A consequence for cells with LMWcyclin E expression is increased genomic instability (6) due to
premature activation of CDC25C (7) and shortening of the
length of mitosis from nuclear envelope breakdown to prometaphase (8). Clinically, the expression of LMW forms of
cyclin E correlates strongly with decreased survival in patients

with breast cancer (9). We have also examined the oncogenic
potential of these isoforms and show that transgenic mice
overexpressing LMW-cyclin E had increased incidence of
mammary tumors and distant metastasis when compared
with mice with full-length cyclin E (10). The critical role of
LMW-cyclin E in mammary tumorigenesis may be the result of
the ability of LMW-cyclin E to bind and activate its Cdk partner,
Cdk2. These isoforms bind more tightly to Cdk2, which leads to
increased Cdk2 kinase activity and decreased sensitivity of the
Cdk2 complexes to inhibition by p21 and p27 (6, 11). The LMWcyclin E expressing cells are also resistant to anti-estrogens (6)
and to aromatase inhibitors (12) due to decreased sensitivity of
the LMW-cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes to p21 and p27, which are
induced in response to anti-estrogen treatment.
Cdk2 is a critical enzyme in the transition of cells from G1 to
S-phase, and its deregulation in cancer could be causative of
oncogenesis. One of the functions of Cdk2 (in complex with
either cyclin E or cyclin A) is to phosphorylate substrates such
as the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) that activates the genes
necessary for S-phase through E2F-dependent transcription.
Additional substrates of cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes include
NPAT, a transcription factor that controls cell cycle–dependent histone gene transcription (13), nucleophosmin (14),
CP110 (15), and Mps1 (16), proteins involved in centrosome
duplication, Brca1 (17) and Ku70 (18), involved in DNA repair,
and Cdk inhibitors, p21 and p27. However, a number of kinaseindependent functions of cyclin E have been described including a role in replication endocycle (19, 20), in replication
licensing during exit from quiescence (21), in oncogenic

transformation by ras and dominant negative p53 (21), and in
cell fate determination (22).
Cdk2-independent functions of cyclin E are also inferred
from in vivo models. For example, knockout of both cyclin E1
and cyclin E2 genes in the mouse leads to embryonic lethality
due to defects in the endo-reduplication of trophoblast cells
(19, 20), whereas Cdk2 knockout mice do not have placental
defects suggesting that E-type cyclins have Cdk2-independent
roles in early development (21). A kinase-deficient cyclin E
mutant can partially restore MCM loading and exit from
quiescence in cyclin E-null cells (21). Cyclin E also localizes
to the centrosomes in a Cdk2-independent fashion, and mutation of the centrosomal localization sequence prevents the
mutated overexpressed cyclin E to increase the S-phase fraction of cells (23). In Drosophila, even when p21 is overexpressed,
cyclin E is required for the initial asymmetric division of certain
neuroblasts for neural segment-specific versus abdomen
lineages suggesting a role in cell fate determination (22). These
kinase-independent functions of the overexpressed cyclin E
might facilitate the escape of tumor cells from quiescence, and
might modify their cell fate, thereby contributing to cancer
formation. A major, unresolved issue is the contribution of
these various kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions of LMW-cyclin E to tumorigenesis. In this study, we have
addressed the question of the requirement of Cdk2 for LMWcyclin E–induced mammary tumorigenesis function by generating LMW-cyclin E transgenic mice with either a Cdk2 wildtype or knockout background. These studies show that LMWcyclin E–mediated tumorigenesis is completely dependent on
the presence of Cdk2.

Materials and Methods
Generation and analysis of transgenic mice
Generation of Cdk2-deficient mice (24), p53-deficent mice
(25), and MMTV-LMW-cyclin E transgenic mice (10) were
described previously. As Cdk2/ mice were reported to be
sterile, the mouse strain was maintained as Cdk2þ/ and
genotyped as previously described (24). Because all our transgenic lines were created and maintained on an inbred FVB/N
background, Cdk2þ/ mice created on a 129/CD-1 background were backcrossed 7 generations into an FVB/N background prior to crosses with p53þ/ and LMW-cyclin E
transgenic lines. Mating MMTV-LMW-cyclin E; Cdk2þ/
mice with Cdk2þ/ mice yielded the 3 experimental groups
MMTV-LMW-cyclin E; Cdk2þ/þ, MMTV-LMW-cyclin E;
Cdk2þ/, and MMTV-LMW-cyclin E; Cdk2/. Crossing
MMTV-LMW-cyclin E; Cdk2þ/ mice with p53/;
Cdk2þ/ mice yielded the 3 experimental groups MMTVLMW-cyclin E; p53þ/; Cdk2þ/þ, MMTV-LMW-cyclin E;
p53þ/; Cdk2þ/, and MMTV-LMW-cyclin E; p53þ/;
Cdk2/. Mice were kept as virgins and were monitored
biweekly, by palpation, for tumor occurrence. Animals showing tumors (with a mean diameter of no more than 1.5 cm)
were killed, and the presence of mammary adenocarcinomas
was confirmed histologically. All experiments were approved
by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of
Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), and were

performed in accordance with relevant institutional and
national guidelines and regulations.
Roscovitine and meriolin 5 treatment of mice
Roscovitine and meriolin 5 were supplied by Dr. Laurent
Meijer (Station Biologique de Roscof, Roscof, France). A
roscovitine stock solution of 10 mg/mL (28 mmol/L) in 50
mmol/L HCl pH 2.5 was prepared and stored at 20 C. Mice
were randomly separated in the control and test groups, which
were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 50 mmol/L HCl pH
2.5 or roscovitine (75 mg/kg) respectively, at 10 mL of stock
solution/g of mouse weight i.p. 2 times daily for 7 days. A
meriolin 5 stock solution of 3.333 mg/mL was prepared in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). For daily injections of laboratory
mice, a working solution of 0.1 mg/mL was freshly prepared
with sterile PBS (30:70, v/v). Mice were randomly separated in
the control and test groups, which were injected i.p. with
DMSO/PBS (30:70, v/v) or meriolin 5 (1 mg/kg/d), for 2 series
of 5 days with a 2-day break in between. Statistical significance
was assessed using the log-rank test of Kaplan–Meier analysis.
Hormone treatment of mice
Twelve-week-old nulliparous mice were treated for 48 hours
with a single interscapular s.c. injection of 17b-estradiol benzoate (1 mg) and progesterone (1 mg) in 100 mL of sesame oil (all
from Sigma). Two hours before killing, animals were injected i.p.
with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 0.03 mg/g of body
weight; Sigma). Mammary glands were removed and fixed in
10% formalin overnight. After embedding in paraffin, tissues
were sectioned (5–7 mm) onto Probe-On Plus charged slides
(Fisher Scientific).
Whole-mount mammary gland staining and histology
Mammary glands from selected mice were dissected out
and fixed on glass slides with Carnoy's solution (glacial acetic :
choloroform : ethanol, 1 : 3 : 6) overnight at room temperature.
The glands were rehydrated prior to overnight staining in
aluminum carmine (1 g carmine, 2.5 g aluminum potassium
sulfate boiled for 20 minutes in distilled H2O, filtered, and
brought to a final volume of 500 mL). The glands were then
dehydrated, cleared with xylene, and mounted. Photographs
were taken under 4 power objective using a digital camera
mounted on a Leica MZ125 microscope. For histologic analysis, 6-mm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin.
BrdUrd incorporation assay
To assess cell proliferation, mice were injected i.p. with
0.25 mg BrdUrd/g of body weight 2 hours before killing. BrdUrd
incorporation was detected on sections by immunohistochemistry using a cell proliferation kit (Amersham) following the
manufacturer's instructions. The numbers of BrdUrd-positive
cells in wild-type and MMTV-cyclin E mammary glands were
counted in 10 fields under a 40 objective lens.
Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, kinase
assays, and immunohistochemistry
Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot
analysis as previously described (26). Briefly, 50 mg of protein

was subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P overnight at 4 C at 35 mV constant
voltage. The blots were blocked overnight at 4 C in BLOTTO
(5% nonfat dried milk in 20 mmol/L Tris, 137 mmol/L NaCl,
0.05% Tween, pH 7.6). After being washed, the blots were
incubated in primary antibodies for 3 hours. Primary antibodies used were cyclin E (HE-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
Cdk2 (Transduction Laboratories), and actin (Chemicon
International Inc.). Blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse
immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate at a dilution of 1:5,000 in BLOTTO for 1 hour and finally washed and
developed by using the Renaissance chemiluminescence system as directed by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer Life
Sciences, Inc.). For immunoprecipitation, 250 mg of tissue
extracts were used per immunoprecipitation with polyclonal
antibody to cyclin E coupled to protein A beads. After being
washed, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with kinase
assay buffer containing 60 mmol/L cold ATP, 5 mCi of
[32P]ATP, and 5 mg of histone H1 (Roche Diagnostics Corporation) in a final volume of 30 mL at 37 C for 30 minutes. The
products of the reaction were analyzed on 13% SDS-PAGE gels,
and the gels were stained, destained, dried, and exposed to Xray film. For quantitation, the protein bands corresponding to
histone H1 were excised, and the radioactivity of each band
was measured by Cerenkov counting. For immunohistochemistry, the sections were incubated in 1% H2O2 to block
endogenous peroxidase activity. To retrieve nuclear antigens
on paraffin embedded sections, slides were incubated for 20
minutes in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 90 C.
The sections were then incubated for 60 minutes in 5% fetal
calf serum (FCS) overnight with primary antibodies, followed
by 2-hour incubation at room temperature with appropriate
secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Rabbit polyclonal anti–cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-198 (C19) that specifically recognized the human
cyclin E protein was used for the transgenic cyclin E. For
detection, the Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Labs) was used.
Compounds, cell lines, and culture conditions
CVT-313, a selective and potent inhibitor of Cdk2, was
obtained from Enzo Life Sciences International, while roscovitine and meriolin 5 were provided by Dr. Laurent Meijer.
Serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories and cell
culture medium from Life Technologies, Inc. The culture
conditions for HCC1806, HCC1569, ZR75-1, UACC812, and
MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines were described previously
(27, 28). All cell lines were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection and used within 6 months.
RNA interference
The synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were synthetized by Sigma. siRNAs were targeting Cdk2
on nucleotides 274–292 in NM_001798 for Cdk2 siRNA#1 (ID#
SASI_Hs01_00060175) and on nucleotides 308–326 in
NM_001798 for Cdk2 siRNA#2 (ID# SASI_Hs01_00060174). A
MISSION siRNA Universal Negative Control #1 was used as
negative control (Neg). Breast cancer cell lines were cultured
for 24 hours in 6-well plates and transfected with 2 mg siRNA

using X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche)
according to manufacturer's protocol. For MCF-7 LMW-cyclin
E (T2) cells, doxycycline (1 mg/mL) was used to induce
expression of LMW (T2) cyclin E for 24 hours before siRNA
transfection.
MTT metabolism assay
Cell proliferation assays were carried out using MTT assays,
where MTT is reduced to purple formazan by the mitochondria
of living cells. Increase in cell number is detected by augmented
MTT metabolism, and decrease in cell number is reflected by
decrease in MTT metabolism. MCF-7 cells that can inducibly
express Flag-tagged LMW-cyclin E (T2) upon treatment with
doxycycline [described in (7)] were plated at a density of 2,500
cells per well in 96-well plates and cultured overnight in MEM
supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were incubated with or
without doxycycline (1 mg/mL) for 24 hours, and cells were then
treated with either diluent (DMSO) or CVT-313 (29), or meriolin 5 (30), or roscovitine (31) at 8 different concentrations for
48 hours. Stock solution for each drug was made in DMSO at a
concentration of 25 mmol/L for CVT-313, 10 mmol/L for
roscovitine, and 1 mmol/L for meriolin 5 followed by 2-fold
serial dilution in the medium. Each well was replaced with 200
mL of fresh medium containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL) and incubated
for 4 hours. The medium was then removed and 100 mL of
solubilization buffer (0.04M HCl, 1% SDS in isopropyl alcohol)
was added to each well. The plate was agitated in the dark for
5 minutes to dissolve the MTT-formazan crystals. The absorbance of the samples was recorded at 590 nm in a multiwell
plate reader (Perkin-Elmer Victor 1420). Results were plotted
as the mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] values of quadruplicates from a representative experiment that was repeated
at least 2 independent times.
Statistical analysis
Tumor onset data were analyzed for statistical significance
by using survival analysis methods. Within each genotype,
tumor-free survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test using
Prism (GraphPad software, Inc.). Results are shown as mean
 SD. Differences were considered significant when the
2-tailed Student's t test showed differences at P < 0.05.

We compared the appearance of mammary glands of adult,
virgin Cdk2/ females with that of Cdk2þ/þ and Cdk2þ/
by whole mounts stained with carmine red (Fig. 1A). The
results reveal that although the development of the whole
mammary glands proceeds relatively normally in all 3 genotypes, the branching morphogenesis is decreased in the
Cdk2/ animals (Fig. 1A). This raised the question of
whether there is a defect in the ability of the mammary cells
to proliferate in the Cdk2/ mice, or if the decreased
branching is linked to an indirect effect of Cdk2 loss on the

ovaries. To address this question, we examined the ability of
mammary epithelial cells in each of the 3 genotypes to
proliferate in response to pregnancy hormones, estrogen
and progesterone. To mimic the burst of proliferation
observed during early pregnancy, Cdk2þ/þ, Cdk2þ/, and
Cdk2/ mice were treated acutely with 1 mg of estrogen and
1 mg of progesterone either once for 48 hours or 3 times, 48
hours apart. The 2 hormones were injected in 100 mL of
sesame oil under the skin between the shoulder blades.
Two hours before killing, the mice were injected with BrdUrd

formation but decreased branching with a 2-fold decrease in
proliferation in the terminal end buds (TEB; 4.8% vs. 8.5% of
BrdUrd positive cells in Cdk2þ/þ). Cdk2/ mice treated
once for 48 hours with EþP showed a slight increase in
proliferation in the TEBs with 6.1% of BrdUrd positive cells
but well below the 30% to 40% of BrdUrd positive cells in
Cdk2þ/þ and Cdk2þ/ mammary glands. However, when
mice were treated with hormones 3 times 48 hours apart, then
35% to 40% of mammary cells were BrdUrd positive in Cdk2/
 mammary glands, a percentage similar to Cdk2þ/þ and
Cdk2þ/ mammary glands (Fig. 1B and C). Collectively, these
results suggest that the absence of Cdk2 delays proliferation of
the mammary cells in the TEBs; however this delay can be
rescued by sustained treatment with estrogen and progesterone. These results also suggest that the absence of Cdk2 has

and 13 months with 100% penetrance, their MMTV-LMWcyclin E; p53þ/; Cdk2/ littermates are resistant to tumor

not altered the ability of mammary epithelial cells to proliferate in response to stimuli, in this case pregnancy hormones.
Resistance of Cdk2/ mice to LMW-cyclin E–induced
breast cancer
The critical role of LMW-cyclin E in mammary oncogenesis
and tumorigenesis (6, 32) may be the result of the ability of
LMW-cyclin E to bind and activate Cdk2. To specifically test
the importance of LMW-cyclin E–associated Cdk2 kinase
activity in mammary oncogenesis, we generated double and
triple transgenic mice with the genotypes LMW-cyclin E/
Cdk2/ and LMW-cyclin E/p53þ//Cdk2/. The transgene in all these animals is under the control of the MMTV
promoter. We followed the MMTV-LMW-cyclin E mice in the
different genotypes for mammary tumor incidence and found
that the loss of Cdk2 protected Cdk2/ mice from breast
cancer induced by LMW-cyclin E in the p53þ/þ (Fig. 2A) or
p53þ/ (Fig. 2B) background. Whereas LMW-cyclin E mice in
Cdk2þ/ or Cdk2þ/þ background succumb to mammary
tumors with mean latencies of 16 and 19.5 months respectively, their LMW-cyclin E; Cdk2/ littermates do not form
mammary tumors (Fig. 2A). Similarly, although MMTV-LMW-

Cdk2 absence does not prevent LMW-cyclin E
expression in the mammary gland
Next, we examined if in the absence of Cdk2 the cyclin E
transgene is expressed equally in each genotype. To this end
we examined cyclin E levels by immunohistochemical analysis
in the mammary glands of LMW-cyclin E transgenic mice in a
Cdk2þ/þ or Cdk2/ background (Fig. 3A). The results
revealed that similar levels of the transgene expression in
the mammary glands of Cdk2þ/þ; and Cdk2/ females
were observed. In addition, the ducts in each genotype had
similarly normal morphology (Fig. 3A). These results rule out
the possibility that the differences in breast cancer free

survival could be caused by an inadequate expression of
LMW-cyclin E transgene in the mammary glands of
Cdk2/ animals and that Cdk2 absence does not prevent
LMW-cyclin E expression in the mammary glands.
We then asked if the cyclin E–associated kinase activity in
the Cdk2/ mammary glands was completely dependent on
Cdk2. We measured the cyclin E–associated kinase activity
using histone H1 and found a total absence of cyclin E–
associated kinase activity in the Cdk2/ mammary glands
(Fig. 3B). Hence, even though the LMW-cyclin E is being
expressed in the mammary gland (Fig. 3A), the protein
does not retain any cyclin E–associated kinase activity in a
Cdk2/ background.
Roscovitine and meriolin treatment delay LMW-cyclin
E–induced breast cancer
Next, we set out to investigate if targeting Cdk using
roscovitine and meriolin 5, two Cdk2 inhibitors, would suppress mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-LMW-cyclin E
transgenic mice in a Cdk2þ/þ background. Roscovitine
(31) is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cdk1, Cdk2, and
Cdk5, with strong antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in
preclinical models and antitumor activity in several xenograft

models. Roscovitine is well tolerated when administered by i.p.
injection, and displays high bioavailability (33). To assess if
treatment of the LMW-cyclin E transgenic mice with roscovitine would delay tumor formation, we i.p. injected a group of 7
mice with DMSO and a group of 7 mice with roscovitine
starting at 7 months, twice a day for 7 days. We used the LMWcyclin E; p53þ/ double transgenic animals for these studies
as tumor formation in these animals occurs early at 7 months
and with 100% penetrance. Treatment of these mice with
roscovitine resulted in a significant delay in tumor formation.
Specifically, we found a 5.2-week difference in improved
median survival for roscovitine-treated mice compared with
DMSO-treated mice (Fig. 4A). Similar tumor delay was
observed when a novel analogue of roscovitine, meriolin 5,
was used. Meriolin 5, belongs to a new family of inhibitors of
Cdks with enhanced selectivity with marked potency for Cdk2
and Cdk9, binding within the ATP-binding site of the kinase.
Meriolin 5 displays antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties in human tumor cell cultures (30, 34). For these experiments, a group of 7 LMW-cyclin E; p53þ/ double transgenic
mice were injected with meriolin 5, single daily intraperitoneal
injections at a dose of 1 mg/kg for 2 series of 5 days with a
2-day break in between (Fig. 4B). We found a 6.9-week

difference in median survival for meriolin 5–treated mice
compared with DMSO-treated (drug carrier) mice. These
results indicate that these Cdk cell-cycle inhibitors may have
some therapeutic activity in LMW-cyclin E–overexpressing
tumors as shown in this preclinical model.
Silencing of Cdk2 is lethal to LMW-expressing breast
cancer cell lines
To evaluate Cdk2 as a potential drug target, we silenced
Cdk2 expression by siRNA in 2 breast cancer cell lines expressing LMW-cyclin E, HCC1806, and HCC1569, and in 2 breast
cancer cell lines with no LMW-cyclin E expression, ZR75-1 and
UACC812 (Fig. 5A). Two days following Cdk2 siRNA transfection, all the cell lines transfected with the scrambled siRNA
increased their cell number by 1.44-, 1.16-, 2.93-, and 1.55-fold
for HCC1806, HCC1569, ZR-75-1, and UACC812, respectively
(Fig. 5B). Cdk2 siRNA transfection did not affect the growth of
the 2 cell lines with no LMW expression, whereas Cdk2 knockdown in LMW-expressing line HCC1806 and 1569 led to a
strong diminution in cell number so that at 2 days following
transfection only 50% of plated cells for 1806 and 10% of plated
cells for 1569 remained on each plate (Fig. 5B). We next asked if
the decrease in cell number following Cdk2 knockdown is due
to cell-cycle arrest or due to cell death. Propidium iodide

staining followed by FACS demonstrated that Cdk2 knockdown in LMW-cyclin E–expressing line HCC1569 and 1806 led
to a strong induction of apoptosis with a 3- to 4-fold increase in
the percentage of cells in sub-G1 compared with cells transfected with the negative control siRNA. In contrast, in the low
LMW-cyclin E lines, there is less than a 2-fold increase in the
percentage of cells in sub-G1. These results suggest that Cdk2
knockdown causes apoptosis/cell death in LMW-cyclin E–
expressing breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 5C).
Next, we asked if cell death observed following Cdk2
inhibition in breast cancer cells is dependent on LMW-cyclin
E expression. For these experiments we used MCF-7 cells that
can inducibly express Flag-tagged LMW-cyclin E (T2) upon
treatment with doxycycline (7). LMW-cyclin E (T2) was
induced for 24 hours followed by silencing of Cdk2 expression
by transient siRNA transfection (Fig. 5D). Cdk2 downregulation resulted in selective inhibition of cell growth at 48 hours
when LMW-cyclin E is induced. Cell proliferation is reduced
by 11.5% for Cdk2 siRNA#1 and by 18.5% for siRNA#2, P ¼ 0.05
and 0.002, compared with control siRNA transfected cells only
when LMW-cyclin E is induced. Downregulation of Cdk2 had
no affect on cell proliferation when LMW-cyclin E was not
induced (Fig. 5D). To extend these findings to clinically
applicable compounds, we used 3 different Cdk inhibitors
(CVT-313, meriolin 5, and roscovitine) at different concentrations and compared the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells in the LMWcyclin E on (with doxycycline) and off (without doxycycline)
settings. CVT-313 is a potent Cdk2 inhibitor, which was
identified from a purine analog library and was shown to
arrest human cells in G1 (29). For each of the 3 drugs, the IC50
was reduced by at least 2-fold when LMW-cyclin E was
expressed (Fig. 5E). These findings show that cell growth
inhibition following Cdk inhibition is dependent on LMWcyclin E overexpression.

Discussion
Previously we showed that expression of LMW-cyclin E
under the control of a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)
promoter results in the development of mammary tumors in
27% of the transgenic mice with a latency of 17 to 19 months
and a third of these mice develop lung metastasis. When
MMTV-LMW-cyclin E mice are crossed with p53þ/ mice,
100% of double transgenic mice develop mammary tumors
with a latency of 11 months (10). In our cohort of an FVB strain
of mice, the p53þ/ allele does not predispose to p53mediated mammary tumor formation. Expression of LMWcyclin E in breast cancer cells induces genomic instability (6–8),
and resistance of Cdk2 complexes to inhibition by p21 and p27
(32). Our results, presented in this article, show that Cdk2 is
essential for oncogenic LMW-cyclin E–induced breast tumorigenesis. Consistent with this finding, inhibition of Cdk
activities using roscovitine or meriolin delays LMW-cyclin
E–induced breast cancer in this mouse model. Furthermore,
targeted silencing of Cdk2-induced cell death in LMW-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, but not in cell lines with no
LMW expression. Consequently, mammary epithelial cells
expressing LMW-cyclin E are unable to initiate transformation

lines expressing LMW-cyclin E, HCC1806 and HCC1569, and 2 breast cancer cell lines with no LMW-cyclin E expression, ZR75-1 and UACC812, were
harvested at 48 hours and immunoblotted for cyclin E. B, 100,000 cells for each cell line were plated at day 0, transfected with scrambled siRNA (Neg)
or siRNA against Cdk2 (#1 and #2). Samples were harvested at 48 hours and counted using a Coulter counter. C, FACS analysis of the same cells as in B (left)
and Western blot analysis for Cdk2 and actin (right). The levels of proteins were measured by densitometric scanning of the corresponding bands and
normalized using actin values. The values indicated at the bottom (in %) were compared with the values obtained with scrambled siRNA transfected cells
set at 100%. D, pTRE–LMW-cyclin E (T2) stably transfected MCF-7 cells were incubated with or without doxycycline (Dox, 1 mg/mL) for 24 hours then
transfected with 21-bp double-strand siRNA against Cdk2 or with a negative control siRNA. Cells were collected 48 hours later and used for counting or
Western blot analysis with cyclin E (T2), Cdk2, and actin antibodies. E, effect of the expression of LMW-cyclin E (T2) induced by doxycycline in MCF-7 cells on

incubated with or without doxycycline (1 mg/mL) for 24 hours, and then treated with either diluent (DMSO) or CVT-313, or meriolin 5, or roscovitine at 8 different
concentrations for 48 hours and MTT metabolism was measured. Absorbance was measured at 590 nm. The mean absorbance values of diluent-treated
samples were taken as 100%. Absorbance values of the cells treated with different drugs are plotted as percentages with respect to the mean value of the
diluent-treated samples. A least squares fit was obtained to estimate the IC50. Means and 95% CIs of an experiment representative of 3 independent

LMW Cyclin E Mammary Tumorigenesis is Dependent on Cdk2

in the absence of Cdk2, whereas the oncogenic LMW-cyclin E/
Cdk2 kinase provides breast cancer cells with the capabilities
to resist cell death and as such is required to sustain tumor cell
proliferation.
We also show that Cdk2 development of the mammary
glands and ducts proceeds relatively normally except for a
slight decrease in branching in the Cdk2/ animals with a
concomitant 2-fold decrease in the proliferation of the TEBs.
When stimulated by ovarian hormones, the absence of Cdk2
delays proliferation of the mammary cells but this delay can be
rescued by sustained treatment with estrogen and progesterone. This rescue experiment shows that Cdk2 is not required
for developmental proliferation but the delayed proliferative
response of Cdk2/ mammary cells may be linked to the
reduced size of the ovaries of these mice. Other studies
showed that Cdk2 is not required for proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in vivo (35), nor is it required
for neural progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation, and
survival of hippocampal granule neurons in vivo (36). In the
adult subventricular zone, it was shown that Cdk2 is critical
for proliferation and self-renewal of neural progenitor cells
when Cdk4 expression is too low to compensate for loss of
Cdk2 (37). Consequently, functional redundancies by Cdk1 or
Cdk4/6 may compensate for the lack of Cdk2 in those cell
types. For example, Cdk1 was shown to bind cyclin E in
various tissues and also to regulate G1/S-phase transition in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (38). However, we show here
that although Cdk2 is dispensable for mammary gland development, it is required for LMW-cyclin E tumorigenesis. This
reflects the requirement for the phosphorylation of a specific
set of substrates that mediate the oncogenic function of LMWcyclin E/Cdk2 kinase. This result suggests that targeting
LMW-cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity may be a viable and
specific strategy for clinical treatment of certain breast
tumors.
Our experiments show that short-term exposure to roscovitine or meriolin results in a significant delay of LMW-cyclin
E–induced mammary tumor development. This delay may be
due to decreased proliferation and partial induction of cell
death following treatment. These results also suggest that the
LMW-cyclin E transgenic mouse model should be a valuable
tool to specifically evaluate drugs against the oncogenic LMWcyclin E/Cdk2 kinase frequently expressed in triple-negative
breast cancers. Future studies will aim at identifying the
targets of the oncogenic LMW-cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase that
provide breast cancer cells with the capabilities to resist cell
death.
We also propose that breast cancer patients whose tumors
express the LMW-cyclin E will be most responsive to Cdk2

inhibitors such as roscovitine or its analogues. Several CDK
inhibitors have entered clinical trials including flavopiridol
and seliciclib (roscovitine). Phase I studies have demonstrated
that these drugs can generally be administered safely (39, 40).
Phase II studies with CDK inhibitors have shown little singleagent activity in solid tumors including metastatic melanoma
(41) and endometrial adenocarcinoma (42) but combination
with chemotherapy seems more efficient (43–45). Overall, the
results from clinical trials of CDK inhibitors in breast cancer
have been disappointing.
When introducing novel treatment strategies in the clinic,
special attention must be given toward identifying the patient
population who will respond most effectively to such treatment. In addition, particular attention must be given to the
mechanism of action of the agent to decipher the best treatment modality (i.e., single agent or in combination). Specifically, for roscovitine, only those patients whose tumors
express LMW-cyclin E will be most responsive to this
treatment.
Our study presented here shows that CDK2 kinase inhibitor
is preferentially effective in LMW-cyclin E–overexpressing
breast cancer and reinforces the need for a more targeted
approach for the evaluation of this class of drugs to subgroups
of breast cancer patients with high LMW-cyclin E expression.
Our in vitro data show that the 2 CDK inhibitors used are
cytotoxic for breast cancer cells expressing LMW-cyclin E so
that we could expect to reach the same level of clinical efficacy
as observed for hematologic malignancies that are more
sensitive to induction of apoptosis (46, 47). It should be noted
that none of the patients treated with roscovitine in either
phase I or phase II studies were preselected based on altered
expression of cyclin E or Cdk2. As a result, the clinical
experience with roscovitine has been unimpressive. If patients
are preselected based on their cyclin E expression their
responses will likely improve.
