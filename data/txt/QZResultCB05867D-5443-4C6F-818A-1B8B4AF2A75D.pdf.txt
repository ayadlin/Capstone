Prodding the Beast: Assessing the Impact of
Treatment-Induced Metastasis
John M.L. Ebos1,2

Abstract
The arsenal of treatments for most cancers ﬁt broadly into the
categories of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapy. All represent proven and successful strategies, yet each can
trigger local (tumor) and systemic (host) processes that elicit
unwanted, often opposing, inﬂuences on cancer growth. Under
certain conditions, nearly all cancer treatments can facilitate
metastatic spread, often in parallel (and sometimes in clear
contrast) with tumor reducing beneﬁts. The paradox of treatment-induced metastasis (TIM) is not new. Supporting preclinical
studies span decades, but are often overlooked. With recent
evidence of prometastatic effects following treatment with targeted agents blocking the tumor microenvironment, a closer

Background
The Lernaean Hydra that Hercules must slay in Greek mythology
has multiple heads that, once cut off, have two more spring up to
replace it. It would be unsettling to consider that any therapy might
help cancer become like the hydra. Yet evidence in mouse cancer
models suggest that most, if not all, treatments or actions (including surgery) against normal and malignant cell functions may
create tumor cell phenotypes and permissive niche environments
that can facilitate metastatic spread (1, 2). The phenomenon of
treatment-induced metastasis (TIM) is not new in the preclinical
literature—some dating back more than 60 years—but it is often
overlooked as a mechanism that may contribute to eventual
resistance and disease progression following therapy failure. The
reason for this may stem, at least in part, from the fact that
supporting data primarily come from studies in animals, and
therefore must be put into context in terms of translational and
clinical relevance. Approved anticancer treatments block or eliminate cancer growth and represent effective strategies proven in
hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide over multiple dec1

inspection of this literature is warranted. The TIM phenomena
may diminish the impact of effective therapies and play a critical
role in eventual resistance. Alternatively, it may simply exemplify
the gap between animal and human studies, and therefore have
little impact for patient disease and treatment. This review will
focus on the preclinical model systems used to evaluate TIM and
explore the mechanisms that inﬂuence overall treatment efﬁcacy.

ades. Evidence of TIM in animals, however, derives in large part
from proof-of-principal studies that are condition dependent and
contrast directly (and often simultaneously) with treatment beneﬁts in primary (localized) tumors. Furthermore, therapy is likely
only one of several stimulators of the metastatic process. For a
localized primary tumor to acquire the aggressive and invasive
properties necessary to colonize and spread systemically to grow
into eventual metastasis, a multitude of tumor- and host-mediated
conditions are required. This includes prometastatic stimuli intrinsic to the tumor, such as the multistep genetic and epigenetic
alterations that can promote an increased ability to manipulate
(and survive in) the surrounding microenvironment (3), and
stimuli extrinsic to the tumor. For the latter, promotion of metastatic potential can involve stress reactions, degradation of the
extracellular matrix, altered pH and oxygen levels, and adaptive
immune responses (reviewed in ref. 4). For this reason, evaluating
exogenous therapeutics as a prometastatic stimulus has been
historically difﬁcult, particularly against a backdrop where the
major effects are beneﬁcial overall. Regardless, recent studies have
reinvigorated interest in whether therapy may play a major role in
promoting changes in the tumor and stroma that, either independently or together, facilitate disease progression. Ultimately, no
anticancer strategy has been consistently curative and resistance
remains an enduring challenge for any treatment or tumor type,
and therefore a careful study of the TIM literature is warranted.
This review will highlight the preclinical models used to show
prometastatic properties of cancer management strategies and
discuss the potential for common underlying mechanisms deriving from both the tumor and the host that may contribute to
changes in a tumor's metastatic potential.

from the varied mouse tumor models used to tease out treatment
effects in different disease stages. In patients with solid tumors,
metastasis is the most common cause of mortality, and (where
possible) it follows surgical removal of a primary tumor at an
earlier stage. However, preclinical experimental therapeutics historically (and most typically) evaluate only localized tumor
growth (5). The initiation of a primary tumor in mice can include
chemical induction, genetic engineering (i.e., conditional or
unconditional expression of tumorigenic genes), or implantation—the latter of which can include ectopic or orthotopic insertion of tumor cells or tissue fragments (6). Preclinical metastasis
models mostly involve spontaneous disease deriving from a
primary tumor and that can be assessed while (i) the primary
tumor is in place (typically this is done at an endpoint dictated by
primary size) or (ii) following surgical removal (which more
faithfully recapitulate the clinical scenario, though are less commonly performed; ref. 7). Alternatively, an experimental metastasis model can be used that involves directly injecting tumor cells
into the bloodstream thereby circumventing the initial growth
and intravasation stages (see detailed reviews in refs. 5, 7).

Therapeutic Impact and Metastasis
A signiﬁcant challenge in treating metastasis in animal models
tends to be variability, which may stem in part from nonstandardized protocols for endpoints and techniques for disease quantiﬁcation. Although therapeutic effects in primary/localized tumor
models can be empirically quantiﬁed with relative ease at later
stages (i.e., by caliper measurement or manual palpation), assessing the multistage process of metastasis is more arduous. Metastasis formation from a primary tumor includes several steps, such
as cellular adhesion loss; increased motility and invasions; intravasation into the bloodstream; extravasation and micrometastases
formation; and colonization in a new distant site (8). For this
reason, replicating this process in mice has several obstacles. These
include: (i) poor metastatic potential (tumor cells and models
often do not consistently metastasize); (ii) high variability (progression and distribution rates can dramatically inﬂuence endpoint
assessments such as survival); and (iii) difﬁcult quantiﬁcation
(empirical assessment of metastatic spread and burden is often
inconsistent). Importantly, techniques are rapidly improving
metastasis models. This includes the selection of tumor cells with
high metastatic potential (achieved by repeated in vivo selection),
the use of molecular markers (i.e., luciferase) to track in vivo spread,
and the increasing use of clinically relevant surgical models (9).
However, the real challenge in assessing the impact of treatment
on metastasis is that tumor growth can respond differently,
depending on location and stage. For instance, cells implanted
ectopically or orthotopically can respond differently to treatment,
something shown by Fidler and colleagues in murine colon cancer
tumors treated with chemotherapy (10). As well, primary tumors
and metastatic disease can respond differently to treatment (11).
Such variability can lead to a number of different outcomes in
preclinical study. Besides having no effect, a treatment may cause:
(i) reductions in primary tumor and metastasis; (ii) only primary
tumor reduction (no effect on metastasis); or (iii) only metastasis
reduction (no effect on primary; see ref. 11 for review). In the last
instance, discovery of "metastatic-only" treatments tend to be
rare, owing in large part to the lack of studies where metastasis is
quantiﬁed alone or separately from localized tumor effects following treatment. Nevertheless, such antimetastatic treatments

3428 Cancer Res; 75(17) September 1, 2015

have been noted in preclinical models with inhibitors of c-Met
and low doses of chemotherapy, to name only a few (see detailed
review ref. 12).

Treatment-Induced Metastasis
Radiation and chemotherapy
Variability in metastatic preclinical studies can also include the
promotion of disease, though the many examples in the literature
are often overlooked. For instance, radiotherapy has been used for
more than a century and represents an established and effective
tool in the treatment of multiple cancers, including in the prostate,
breast, lung, and head and neck, among others (13). However,
evidence that irradiation in animal models can promote metastasis also has a long history. In the 1940s, Kaplan and Murphy
were among the ﬁrst to show spontaneous mouse tumors serially
passaged subcutaneously in vivo were reduced in size following
thoracic radiation yet paradoxically produced increased metastatic nodules in the lungs (14). By the 1980s, numerous studies had
demonstrated that irradiated normal tissue, either adjacent to the
tumor or at distant sites, created a more permissive venue for
metastatic cell dissemination while simultaneously slowing localized tumor growth. For example, Brown and Marisa showed that
preirradiation of mice 48 hours before i.v. inoculation with
mouse KHT sarcoma cells could increase the number of pulmonary metastatic foci 100-fold (ref. 15; see ref. 2 for extensive
reviews). This phenomenon is known as the "tumor bed effect"
and has since been shown to be time, dose, cell, and mouse strain
dependent (16). Although the prometastatic outcome of preirradiation suggests a dominant role of the host in facilitating this
effect, similar metastasis-inducing changes have been shown to
originate from the tumor as well. For example, in what is now
referred to as the "Reverez effect" following its discovery in the
1950s (17), tumor cells that have been lethally irradiated can also
assist nonirradiated tumor cells in promoting tumor growth when
they are mixed together and injected into animals.
However, clearly not all effects of irradiation are metastasis
promoting. In striking contrast, tumor cells that are directly irradiated can elicit genotoxic effects on adjacent cells, thereby promoting cell death (called the "by-stander effect"; ref. 18), or even
reduce tumor growth at distant site (called the "abscopal effect";
ref. 19). Though such opposing effects may be challenging to
reconcile, they highlight the complexity and consequences that a
single treatment can have on tumor growth and how the outcome
of progression can depend on context and experimental condition.
In the case of systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, the
modiﬁcation of tumor cell behavior to increase metastasis has
also been shown to have tumor-reducing effects that juxtapose
with metastasis-promoting capability. For example, cyclophosphamide (among many other agents), when given in low or high
doses to animals before inoculation with tumor cells, can produce
accelerated experimental metastasis and reduced overall survival
(see Table 1 for examples). These "opposite effects" have been
demonstrated recently (20, 21) and several decades ago (22, 23),
and contrast strikingly with the tumor-reducing beneﬁts of the
same drug and same tumor cells given in a different context (i.e.,
following ectopic or orthotopic implantation; ref. 21).
Other drugs and conditions
It is important to note that such effects are not isolated to
radiation and chemotherapy. Surgical removal of a tumor was ﬁrst

NOTE: Preclinical studies of metastasis promoted by therapy. Metastasis models include: (i) experimental (tumor cell injection into bloodstream) or (ii) spontaneous metastasis (occurring from localized tumors, ectopic or
orthotopic, left in situ or surgically removed). Study examples include several variations of how prometastatic growth was shown. These include: (i) reduction (or no change) of primary tumor growth and spontaneous
metastasis but increased experimental metastasis when animals 'preconditioned' prior to cell inoculation; (ii) decreased metastasis (experimental or spontaneous) in one organ (i.e., lung) but increased in another (i.e., liver),
etc. Studies were largely conducted in mice (used for illustration), but some were carried out in rabbits, rats, dogs, and zebraﬁsh.  , example includes treatment-induced in vitro selection of tumor cells with metastatic
phenotype with no corresponding in vivo experiments.

shown to accelerate growth of tumors at distant sites more than a
century ago, with evidence suggesting that disruption of the tumor
site can exacerbate residual disease growth (see detailed review in
ref. 24). Furthermore, a diverse set of treatments (many not cancer
related) have demonstrated metastasis-promoting effects in
mouse models. Examples include steroids, antidepressants,
analgesics (such as morphine), antioxidants, and vitamin supplements, as well as general perturbations of normal homeostatic
processes such as stress, thermal regulation (i.e., hyperthermia),
and oxygen regulation (including both hypo- and hyperoxia; Table 1).
Mechanisms of TIM
Exactly how therapy can alter the natural history of cancer
progression and allow for circumstances that permit and promote
metastasis remains unclear. Prometastatic responses to treatment
may play a signiﬁcant role in treatment resistance, potentially
undercutting overall beneﬁts and hastening failure. Of signiﬁcance is whether such negative effects originate primarily from the
tumor or the host. As Stephen Paget theorized in 1889 with the
"seed and soil hypothesis" (25), the host organ environment
(soil) and the tumor (seed) must act in concert to promote
metastasis. Therapy may therefore be priming both tumor and
microenvironment to create metastasis-permissive conditions
(26). In this regard, coordinated DNA damage responses (DDR)
following treatment may be responsible, at least in part, for
increased metastatic phenotypes. Nelson and colleagues have
demonstrated that sustained or even transient treatment insults
would tax the DNA repair machinery in both the tumor and the
surrounding cells (27). For instance, genotoxic chemotherapeutics (such as alkylating agents) can cause DNA double-strand
breaks promoted by DNA interstrand cross-links, initiating cellular senescence and apoptosis (for detailed reviews see refs. 27,
28). Simultaneously, a myriad of host and tumor cell secretory
programs may be initiated, all of which may contribute to a
prometastatic phenotype. These can include overlapping components of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (29, 30),
senescent-inﬂammatory responses (31), and a DDR-associated
secretory program (27), among others. Together such responses
can regulate the secretion of a multitude of proinﬂammatory
cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular-matrix remodeling factors such as IL6 and IL8, to name only a few (see (29). Indeed,
recent evidence using experimental models where mice were
conditioned by chemotherapy pretreatment have suggested
host-responses act as strong drivers of the prometastatic response.
Daenen and colleagues showed that paclitaxel and cisplatin given
to mice 4 days before intravenous tumor cell inoculation could
lead to an upregulation of VEGFR-1 on endothelial cells, which, in
turn, coincided with increased metastasis. Speciﬁc VEGFR-1 inhibitors were then shown to mitigate the treatment-mediated
metastasis and extend survival (32).
However, where do systemic changes induced by therapy
originate? There is ample evidence that treatment damage induces
multiple cell types to be mobilized to the tumor and secrete
paracrine and systemic factors that aid in tumor protection and
growth. Gingis-Velistki and colleagues showed that paclitaxel
pretreatment in mice stimulated circulating bone marrow-derived
cells (BMDC) to secrete matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP) such
as MMP-9. They further demonstrated that abrogation of MMP-9
expression in BMDCs using chimeric mice reduced paclitaxelmediated experimental metastasis and improved survival. In

3430 Cancer Res; 75(17) September 1, 2015

addition, recent studies by Sun and colleagues showed that DDR
programs activated by chemotherapy could stimulate ﬁbroblast
secretion of WNT16B, which in turn could activate tumoral
increases in proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelialto-mesenchymal (EMT) phenotypes (33). Together, such chemotherapy-induced "reactions" can create a niche permissive for
metastatic growth, something that has now been shown to
include a multitude of drugs and depend on both cell and organ
environment (for extensive reviews, see refs. 34, 35).
In the case of radiation, Ruegg and colleagues have examined
the tumor bed effect and identiﬁed numerous prometastatic
changes in preirradiated tissue that could assist in facilitating
local invasion and dissemination to the lymph nodes and other
organs [reviewed extensively elsewhere (16)]. As an example,
irradiation-induced damage to endothelial cells has been shown
to induce apoptosis and senescence via p53 and p21, which in
turn could weaken barriers and assist in extravasive tumor potential (1). In addition, elevations in hypoxia and hypoxia-regulated
metastasis genes such as plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR),
have been shown to contribute to metastatic niches in preirradiated tissue (36).

Targeted Therapy and the Tumor
Microenvironment
Although the primary mechanism of action for genotoxic
chemotherapy and radiation is direct tumor cytotoxicity and
includes nonspeciﬁc targeting of proliferating cells, there is an
increasing focus on targeted therapies, some of which are primarily cytostatic, and their impact of treatment on metastasis.
Approved anticancer treatment strategies now include numerous
molecular-targeted drugs that block either speciﬁc malignant
aberrations on cancer cells (i.e., HER2/neu expression on breast
neutralized by the antibody Herceptin) or block the tumor
microenvironment (TME). For the latter, TME inhibitors can aim
to target the extracellular components of tumor cells as well as the
nonmalignant stromal, bone marrow-derived, and immune regulatory cells, which directly support tumor growth (see detailed
review in ref. 37).
TIM and the TME: lessons from angiogenesis inhibitors
While there are several examples of strategies to block elements
of the TME in development, perhaps the most successful clinically
has been the use of angiogenesis inhibitors, which aim to block
the blood vessels tumors require for survival. Since 2004, ten
VEGF pathway inhibitors have been approved in 13 late-stage
cancer types as ﬁrst- or second-line therapy (38). One of the
underlying theoretical advantages of antiangiogenic therapy was
that blockade of the tumor-supporting "normal" cells may be less
prone to drug resistance; however, enduring responses in patients
have been elusive. Indeed, the majority of treated patients eventually succumb to disease and multiple mechanisms of antiangiogenic drug resistance, stemming from both the tumor and the
host, have been described (39).
Perhaps more provocatively, there are increasing clues that
targeting nontumor stromal components may have unintended
consequences. This includes activation of an array of microenvironmental compensatory mechanisms that may limit overall
efﬁcacy as well as augment metastatic disease in certain instances
(39). For example, VEGF inhibition has been shown in preclinical
studies to inhibit tumor progression while simultaneously elicit a

Treatment-Induced Metastasis

more aggressive phenotype (40, 41). Several mechanisms have
been proposed to explain this, many of which offer potential clues
about therapeutic strategies to reverse this effect (42). These
include induced pericyte and PDGF activation (43–46), c-met
pathway promotion (47–50), control of vascular mimicry
(51, 52), hypoxia and HIF1a activation (53), altered metabolic
function (54), collagen signaling (55), increases in IL12b (56), IL8
(57), HTATIP2 (58, 59), heparinases (60), and Semaphorins 3A
and 3E (refs. 61, 62; for review, see ref. 42). In addition, VEGF
pathway inhibition has also been shown to promote metastatic
potential via cellular activation (and increased expression) of
natural killer cells (63), neutrophils (64), and circulating cancer
stem cells (CSC; ref. 65). Yet such ﬁndings remain controversial
and likely depend signiﬁcantly on critical variables such as the
speciﬁc inhibitors (i.e., TKIs do not always behave as antibodies)
and the dose (44, 66). Most critically, and similar to other
instances of TIM, these preclinical results stand in stark contrast
with the beneﬁts of antiangiogenic treatment, often observed in
the same models, simply with modiﬁed experimental conditions
(such as treatment before tumor cell inoculation; see ref. 39;
Table 1).
One intriguing possibility is that the impact of TIM following
TME disruption may not occur during therapy, but instead only
once therapy has been stopped. Indeed, persistent suppression or
stimulation of tumor-mediating host responses could facilitate
putative vascular "rebounds" when treatment is halted or lead to
increased invasive and metastatic potential once primary or
metastatic tumors are surgically removed (67). This may be of
signiﬁcance for certain antiangiogenic therapies with frequent
breaks in dosing periods, or intermittent cessations because of
toxicity (39). For example, some preclinical and clinical evidence
suggests that rapid vascular regrowth may occur when VEGF
pathway inhibition is halted (68, 69) and studies in mice have
demonstrated that CCL2-CCR2 signaling blockade can reduce
metastasis-associated macrophage accumulation (70), but can
result in rapid metastatic growth once antibodies to CCL2 are
removed (71, 72).

Clinical Implications and Future Directions
The most signiﬁcant question related to the preclinical TIM
phenomenon is whether it can translate into human disease
and, if so, to what extent. To date, this question has been
difﬁcult to assess as clinical evidence is limited. In radiotherapy,
the prometastatic tumor bed effect remains controversial, with
the risk of distant metastasis developing following localized
recurrences after treatment seen in some, but not all instances
(16). Likewise for angiogenesis inhibition, no increases in
metastatic disease progression have been observed in retrospective examinations of clinical data following treatment cessation.
This includes VEGF pathway inhibitors such as bevacizumab
and sunitinib (73, 74), as well as with avb3 inhibitors such as
clingitide (75), which had previously been shown to promote
tumor growth in mice (76).
More bad or less good? Challenges interpreting TIM in human
cancer
However, the gap between clinical and preclinical cancer study
must be considered in the context of TIM. Clinical analyses often
derive from retrospective investigation of completed clinical trials
and often involve patients with highly metastatic treatment-

refractory disease, something rarely modeled in animal tumor
studies. In addition, animal studies used to show the TIM phenomena often utilize conditions not tested in human cancers. This
can include the nonclinically relevant models involving experimental (intravenous) metastasis systems, ex vivo manipulated
cancer cell lines, or even conditions not applicable to human
cancer treatment. For the latter, this can include the study of
metastatic growth concurrent with a primary tumor that is not
surgically resected (surgery is often the ﬁrst option in patients), the
lack of multiple or sequential (heroic) treatments upon failure,
or the disparity that exists between endpoint deﬁnitions in terms
of human and mouse progression and survival (77).
It is also possible that TIM effects may coincide with treatment
efﬁcacy and play a role in eventual onset of resistance, as others
have recently described (34). Similar TIM mechanisms may
inﬂuence disease progression at earlier stages of micrometastatic
progression, such as in the perioperative neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting, where induced metastatic niches can be created.
Indeed this raises an important question relating to the clinical
translation of TIM to human cancer, namely, whether the net
effects presented in patients would actually represent a worsening
of disease. It may be the case that preclinical TIM studies may
uncover mechanisms that explain why treatment efﬁcacies are
more limited than predicted or why beneﬁts are not as durable in
the long term. One possible example of this may come from the
case of antiangiogenic therapy in the adjuvant setting. Despite
approvals in established metastatic disease, there are now six
failed phase III trials with VEGF pathway inhibitors in the postsurgical setting. This includes four with the VEGF neutralizing
antibody bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in
colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and triple-negative and HER2þ breast
carcinoma (BR; AVANT, C-08, BEATRICE, and BETH, respectively;
refs. 78, 79), and two with VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKI) in renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (ASSURE and STORM, respectively; refs. 80, 81). In the case of
the CRC, BR, and RCC trials, disease-free survival following
treatment suggested initial beneﬁts (nonsigniﬁcant) but these
were later muted following treatment discontinuation and subsequent follow-up. At least in the case of the AVANT trial,
bevacizumab and chemotherapy-treated patients actually had
numerically worse outcomes than chemotherapy alone.
Together, this has raised speculation about the potential for
longer treatment periods (82) and suggests that macro- and
micrometastatic disease may respond differently to antiangiogenic treatment (39). Whether treatment-induced changes in
tumor biology are occurring as a result of mechanisms related
to the preclinical TIM remain to be investigated in more detail.

Conclusions
The results from preclinical studies demonstrate that both
systemic and localized treatments that manage cancer can impact
tumor growth by facilitating metastatic disease, at least under
speciﬁc experimental conditions. While clinical beneﬁts of
cancer treatments are well established, animal models have provided evidence that conﬂicting impacts of treatment may be
reducing overall beneﬁt. A more detailed investigation into the
clinical translation of studies in animals is beyond this current
review but is critical to consider in a more expanded discussion. It
is possible that TIM-related mechanisms may mask overall beneﬁts of cancer therapy. If so, then strategies to examine how the

TIM phenomena may be mitigated, potentially including treatments that speciﬁcally block metastasis promotion, may require
greater consideration to delay resistance and enhance therapy
