ABSTRACT
CD147/basigin, a transmembrane protein, is a member of the immunoglobulin
super family. Accumulating evidence has revealed the role of CD147 in the
development and progression of various cancers, including malignant melanoma
(MM). MM is a malignancy of pigment-producing cells that causes the greatest number
of skin cancer-related deaths worldwide. CD147 is overexpressed in MM and plays
an important role in cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis,
probably by mediating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production,
glycolysis, and multi-drug resistance (MDR). As a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
inducer, CD147 could also promote surrounding fibroblasts to secrete abundant MMPs
to further stimulate tumor cell invasion. Targeting CD147 has been shown to suppress
MM in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the therapeutic potential of CD147 silencing in MM
treatment. In this review article, we discuss CD147 and its biological roles, regulatory
mechanisms, and potential application as a molecular target for MM.

INTRODUCTION

[9, 10]. The pathogenesis of UV light exposure is largely
unknown, but it directly leads to DNA mutation and
accelerates malignant change through overexpressed
growth factors like stem cell factor and fibroblast growth
factor. MM’s resistance to apoptosis reveals that the
cancer has a genetic component [11-13]. Recent studies
by our group have shown that CD147 plays a pivotal role
in the pathogenesis and progression of MM and other
diseases [14-23]. Moreover, CD147 has the potential to
serve as a novel therapeutic target for MM with multiple
drug resistance. In the last decade, we reported that downregulation and gene knockdown of CD147 could suppress
MM`s proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis. This
approach could also stimulate the production of matrix
metalloproteases (MMPs), and change the glycolysis
level and interaction with calcium-modulating cyclophilin
ligand through a dynamic pathway [24-29]. Recently, our
team found that CD147 is expressed in the mitochondria
and interacts with NDUFS6 to influence complex I
viability of MM cell lines. This process may involve the
regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); as a
result, CD147 moves to the cytoplasm from the membrane

It is estimated that the annual increase in the
incidence rate of melanoma has been approximately 3–7%
per year worldwide for Caucasians which has the highest
incidence[1]; over 90% of U.S. patients with cutaneous
Malignant Melanoma (MM) are non-Hispanic whites.
However, Cockburn et al. reported that the rate of MM
in Hispanic whites is rising [2, 3], and the melanoma
occurrence rates have doubled in all socioeconomic status
(SES) groups over the last decade [3]. A “good clinical
eye” is an “ABCD” rules method-based approach that
can be used to reduce melanoma mortality [4, 5]. Tumor
invasiveness, distant metastasis, recurrence, and multidrug resistance (MDR) make MM a leader of fatalities
despite a plethora of treatment options, including surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy [6-8]. Therefore, it is
necessary to explore effective methods for improving
outcomes.
The mechanisms of malignant melanoma are
complicated, but include sunlight exposure and heredity

function in MM and the signaling pathways it activates,
and discuss its potential role in MM treatment.

CD147 independently [30-32]: it is located at p13.3 on
chromosome 19 [33]. CD147 was identified as a functional
molecule involved in many cellular events, such as the
inflammatory processes, as a receptor for cyclophilin
A [31], and as a potential participant in HIV infection.
Moreover, CD147 was found on the surface of tumor cells
[34] and may trigger the production or release of MMPs
in surrounding mesenchymal and tumor cells, thereby
contributing to tumor invasion. The protein portion of
CD147 is 28 kDa, but its high glycosylation increases its
molecular weight to 43-66 kDa.
CD147 is an important cell-surface protein. There
are three Asn glycosylation sites in the extracellular
region[31, 34, 35]. The glycan portion differs according
to the CD147 source. This glycosylation difference is
responsible for various CD147 weights from different
sources. CD147 has two Ig domains in the extracellular
region. The more C-terminally located Ig-domain has an

of a related protein. The involvement of CD147 in
inflammation through binding with cyclophilin A is
consistent with previous findings: CD147 becomes
expressed in activated lymphocytes, CD147 is upregulated
upon collagen-induced arthritis [58], and CD147-deficient
lymphocytes exhibit an altered reaction upon mixed
lymphocyte reaction.

The biological function of CD147 in cancer
CD147 was found on the surface of tumor cells
and promoted the production of MMPs in neighboring
mesenchymal cells, leading to enhanced tumor invasion.
CD147 is frequently overexpressed in human cancers,
and significantly contributes to malignant phenotypes.
Up-regulation of CD147 also has been noted in glioma,
laryngeal squamous cell, ovarian, renal cell and skin
carcinoma[36-39]. Further, CD147 enhances the invasion
and survival of cancer cells in various pathways. Among
these, the induction of MMPs [28, 34, 40] and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [40-42] is important.
The former enhances tumor invasion and metastasis,
while the latter leads to tumor angiogenesis. Cell
surface expression of MCTs is required for tumor cell
energy metabolism and contributes to their growth and
invasion. Activities related to tumor cell survival include
suppression of anoikis [43] and increased drug resistance.
Furthermore, CD147 promotes hyaluronan synthesis [44],
upregulates the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway [45],
promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition [46], and
receives a signal of an osteopontin peptide, together with
cyclophilin C [47].

THE ROLE OF CD147 IN MALIGNANT
MELANOMA
CD147 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis
of MM cells
It has been well established that CD147 plays
critical roles in mediating cell proliferation, apoptosis,
and oxidative stress. Miho Hatanaka found melanoma
cell growth was inhibited by CD147 silencing[59], Luo
Z reported CD147 regulates mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway in human malignant melanoma cells by
interacting with NDUFS6[22]. And blocking CD147
induces cell death in cancer cells through impairment of
glycolytic energy metabolism[60].Depletion of CD147
sensitizes human malignant melanoma cells to hydrogen
peroxide-induced oxidative stress[16]. H2O2 has been
shown to induce senescence in normal human skin
fibroblasts, in our group we investigated the molecular
influences and mechanisms of CD147 on H2O2-induced
cellular senescence. We showed that under normal
conditions, shRNA-mediated CD147 silencing could
inhibit cell proliferation, induce premature senescence,
and induce senescence-related cell cycle arrest. While
under oxidative stress conditions induced by H2O2,
CD147 silencing exacerbated cellular senescence by
increasing ROS accumulation and destroying the intrinsic
antioxidant defenses. This process might be related to
the klotho protein, a newly discovered anti-aging protein
[16]. Since CD147 could promote the production and
secretion of MMPs from skin fibroblasts, which is the
major component of the microenvironment of MM [27],
CD147 is potentially implicated in the development and
progression of MM.
Accumulating evidence has gradually revealed the
role of CD147 in the regulation of biological processes,
including cellular viability, apoptosis, senescence, and
oxidative stress, of MM cells. For instance, CD147
has been suggested to exert antioxidant activities. We
investigated the effects of CD147 on proliferation,
apoptosis, and the state of MM cells under H2O2-induced
oxidative stress, and found that inhibition of CD147
increased cellular ROS and destroyed the intrinsic
antioxidant defenses in A375 MM cells [26]. Our group
showed that CD147 is not only located in cell membrane,
but also in the cytoplasm by oxidative phosphorylation

The relationship between cyclophilin A and
CD147
Cyclophilin A (CypA) is the host receptor for the
immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. It is secreted
from cells in response to an inflammatory reaction. CypA
interacts with its cellular receptor CD147 to exert multiple
functions in chemotaxis and cell signaling cascades [4850]. These correlations of CypA with tumor pathogenesis
have been extensively studied [51, 52]. Campa et al.
showed that CypA is the most dominantly expressed
protein in non-small cell lung carcinoma [53], while Li
et al. demonstrated that CypA plays an important role
in pancreatic cancer growth through its interaction with
CD147 [54]. CypA is a secreted growth factor induced
by oxidative stress, and stimulates the ERK1/2 pathway
and cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs) [55, 56]. The cytosolic concentration of CypA
in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and in mucosal cells
from colonic tumors was higher than that in the normal
cells. In addition, secreted CypA is chemoattractive to
neutrophils, eosinophils, and T cells. Moreover, CD147
has been proposed as a receptor for cyclophilin A [57].
CD147 binds to cyclophilin A and transmits a signal
to trigger chemotaxis, and Bsg is involved in signaling

(OXPHOS) possibility [22]. This suggests that CD147 has
a suppressive effect on H2O2-induced oxidative damage,
and therefore protects against MM cell apoptosis.

More importantly, we established a nude mouse xenograft
model of MM and showed that downregulation of CD147
could suppress the tumor’s size and microvessel density
[29].

CD147 regulates angiogenesis of MM cells

CD147 regulates cancer invasion and metastasis
in MM

Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in the invasion and
metastasis of malignant tumors [61], and CD147 has been
reported to induce angiogenesis in pathological processes,
including cancers [62-64]. Hatanaka M found CD147
regulates the angiogenesis by decreasing VEGF expression
in vivo and reducing blood vessel formation[65]. Our
group has demonstrated that the co-expression of CD147
and VEGF might indicate a poor prognosis in acute
myeloid leukemia and may be a highly sensitive predictor
of clinical outcome [66]. Furthermore, CD147 was found
to participate in the regulation of angiogenesis in MM. Su
et al. showed that CD147 silencing could not only suppress
MM cell proliferation and invasion, but also inhibited the
production of VEGF in MM cells via downregulation
of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and MCT4.
These transporters mediate lactate transport, suggesting
that CD147 may promote tumor cell glycolysis and
progression of MM through interacting with MCT1 and
MCT4 [25]. We also demonstrated that siRNA-mediated
CD147 silencing inhibited the expression of VEGF in MM
cells and decreased endothelial cell migration, which is
closely related to the invasion and metastasis of MM [29].

Voigt H found CD147 impacts metastasis
formation[65]. And blocking CD147 could inhibit
the invasiveness, and metastatic activity of malignant
melanoma[29]. In our group we recently showed that the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -associated protein calciummodulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) is bound to
CD147 in human A375 melanoma cells. CD147 silencing
significantly decreased resting [Ca2+]i and the [Ca2+]
i increase induced by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum
Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (TG),
indicating that the interaction between CAML and CD147
regulates ER-dependent [Ca2+]i signaling. Upregulation
of [Ca2+]i could induce the production of MMP-9 in A375
cells with the expression of CD147[24]. Thus, CD147
may participate in the ER-dependent [Ca2+]i signaling
pathway, which may mediate MM invasion and metastasis.
Thus, CD147 may act as an oncogene in MM,
and targeting CD147 could inhibit cancer cell viability,
proliferation, and invasion, while inducing cell senescence
and apoptosis in MM cells. The underlying molecular

regulation of oxidative stress, glycolysis, and angiogenesis
in either the MM cells or surrounding cells in the tumor
microenvironment.

in a nude mouse model of pulmonary metastasis [29].
Accordingly, CD147 may become a potential therapeutic
target for the treatment of MM, mainly because of
its regulatory role in chemical resistance and tumor
metastasis.

THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL

CONCLUSIONS

Since CD147 plays a role in various diseases, it
has recently been suggested as a promising target for the
treatment of various diseases. For instance, liver sepsis
could induce a universally altered profile of liver proteins,
including increased cyclophilin. However, inhibition of
CD147, the receptor of cyclophilin, could effectively
attenuate sepsis-induced acute renal failure via inducing
a significant reduction in serum cytokine production [67].
Thus, CD47-targeted therapy may help prevent sepsisinduced renal dysfunction. Furthermore, CD147 has been
suggested to play a role in psoriasis. We showed that
CD147 is highly expressed on peripheral blood smears
and induces neutrophil chemotaxis [18]. We also found a
miRNA-492 binding-site polymorphism in CD147. This
conferred psoriasis risk upon the central south Chinese
population, and suggested that this polymorphism might
be associated with reduced psoriasis susceptibility, by
affecting miRNA-492 binding [17]. Additionally, we
suggested a role of CD147 in regulating ABCG2 transport
of methotrexate in immune cells [15]. Therefore, strategies
involving CD147 targeting could be considered for the
clinical treatment of patients with psoriasis that is resistant
to methotrexate. These findings emphasize the significance
of CD147 in the development of psoriasis.
CD47 silencing also has applications in the
treatment of malignant tumors. We found that CD147
had implications in the regulation of drug transport by
mediating the expression and dimerization of ABCG2.
This affected ABCG2’s cellular localization and drug
transporter function in breast cancer cells [14]. In addition,
we found that siRNA-mediated CD147 inhibition could
reduce proliferation, activation, adhesion, and migration
in human Jurkat T-lymphoma cells [21]. We also
investigated the effect and mechanisms of CD147 on the
MDR phenotype of human oral squamous carcinoma cells
(SCCs), and showed that the expression of CD147 and
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) was upregulated
in MDR-derivative SCCs compared with SCCs. We
further revealed that inhibition of CD147 and subsequent
XIAP depletion might have an anti-tumor effect
through enhancing the susceptibility of cancer cells to
5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis [20]. Since SCC and MM
are both cutaneous carcinomas, targeting CD147 may also
become a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment
of MM. Further, Chen and colleges reported that targeting
CD147 could effectively suppress the size and microvessel
density of tumors in a nude mouse xenograft model of
MM. In addition, the in vivo metastatic potential of A375
cells transfected with CD147 siRNA was suppressed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Despite recent progress on the diagnostic and
therapeutic aspects of MM, the overall survival rate of
patients with MM remains unchanged. Emerging evidence
has gradually revealed the genomic information and
interaction of signaling networks in MM cells, shedding
new light on how to tailor an effective treatment. New
emerging targets, such as CD147, can also be used to
assess the prognosis and risk of recurrence in MM.
However, further studies are needed to unravel the detailed
mechanism of the CD147 pathway in MM and other
cancers.
