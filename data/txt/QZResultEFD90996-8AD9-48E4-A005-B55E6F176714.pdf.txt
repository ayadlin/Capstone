Abstract
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare heterogeneous malignancy with poor
prognosis. Since radical surgery is the only available treatment, more specific and
effective drugs are urgently required. The anti-diabetic drug metformin has been
associated with a decreased cancer prevalence and mortality in several solid tumors,
prompting its possible use for ACC treatment.
This paper evaluates the in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects of metformin
using the ACC cell model H295R.
Metformin treatment significantly reduces cell viability and proliferation in a doseand time-dependent manner and associates with a significant inhibition of ERK1/2
and mTOR phosphorylation/activation, as well as with stimulation of AMPK activity.
Metformin also triggers the apoptotic pathway, shown by the decreased expression of
Bcl-2 and HSP27, HSP60 and HSP70, and enhanced membrane exposure of annexin V,
resulting in activation of caspase-3 apoptotic effector. Metformin interferes with the
proliferative autocrine loop of IGF2/IGF-1R, which supports adrenal cancer growth.
Finally, in the ACC xenograft mouse model, obtained by subcutaneous injection
of H295R cells, metformin intraperitoneal administration inhibits tumor growth,
confirmed by the significant reduction of Ki67%.
Our data suggest that metformin inhibits H295R cell growth both in vitro and
in vivo. Further preclinical studies are necessary to validate the potential anti-cancer
effect of metformin in patients affected by ACC.

INTRODUCTION

which mitotane acts on cancer cells, as well as on the
normal adrenal, is still far from being fully elucidated.
In such a scenario, it is mandatory to combine mitotane
with other drugs, in order to improve the therapeutic
efficacy and reduce treatment toxicity. Of the possible
drugs that could be associated with mitotane, those safely
and widely administered for treating other diseases, and
eventually found to also exert anti-neoplastic effects,
should offer the best therapeutic option. Metformin
(1,1-dimethylbiguanide) is a biguanide cationic compound
commonly used as an insulin-sensitizer and glucoselowering drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Epidemiological studies and meta-analyses on large
cohorts of diabetic patients have demonstrated a significant
association between metformin and a reduced incidence

Despite its rarity (1:2 million prevalence),
adrenocortical cancer (ACC) deserves more consideration
on account of its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis
when metastatic at diagnosis. To date, the best curative
option is radical surgery. In case of advanced ACC,
mitotane is the only available medical treatment [1, 2].
Nevertheless, mitotane has proved to be of limited
efficacy and poor tolerability, thus often reducing the
patient’s compliance. The drug’s therapeutic range is
reached in less than 50% of treated patients [1]; moreover,
specific polymorphisms of the CYP2B6 gene have been
associated with reduced circulating levels of mitotane,
further decreasing its efficacy [3]. The mechanism by

of various types of solid tumors [4–7], supporting the
potential use of metformin as an anti-cancer drug [8].
Several clinical trials are currently ongoing to specifically
test metformin efficacy in cancer prevention and therapy
[9, https://clinicaltrials.gov]. A considerable number
of studies have demonstrated the anti-cancer activity
of this drug both in in vitro and in vivo tumor models,
highlighting a direct anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
effect on cancer cells and an indirect action on metabolic
regulation [8, 9].
The present paper investigates the in vitro and in
vivo effects of metformin on the H295R adrenocortical
cancer cell line.

H295R growth. We assessed the ability of the drug to
activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) energy
sensor, via its phosphorylation in the Thr172 residue.
Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed a significant
dose-related AMPK phosphorylation stimulation,
confirming that this intracellular pathway downstream
from metformin action is also activated in H295R
(Figure 3A, 3B).
Since in colon cancer metformin exerts an antiproliferative effect by suppressing IGF-1R signaling
[10], we next analyzed the activating phosphorylation
pattern for Akt and extracellular signal-regulated
kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), the two main IGF-1R
downstream pathways in H295R cells [11]. Increasing
doses of metformin inhibited phosphorylation of both
ERK1 and 2 (Figure 3C, 3D), with no significant
effect on Akt phosphorylation (data not shown).
Signaling pathways downstream from IGF-1R
have been shown to converge in mTOR activation to
sustain cell proliferation in both H295R [12,13] and
ACC [14]. A 24 hour metformin treatment induced
a dose-dependent inhibition of mTOR activating
phosphorylation in the Ser2448 residues (Figure 3E, 3F),
as well as a significantly lower IGF-1R net expression
(Figure 3G, 3H).

RESULTS
Metformin inhibits cell viability and
proliferation in H295R cells
To investigate the effects of metformin on ACC,
we first evaluated whether metformin interfered with
viability in two available ACC cell lines, H295R and
SW13. In vitro administration of increasing doses of
metformin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent
decrease of cell viability, which was statistically
significant starting from 24 hours, as assessed by
MTS assay in both the H295R (Figure 1A) and SW13
(Figure 1B) cell lines. Analysis of MTS dose-response
curves allowed calculation of metformin inhibitory half
doses (IC50) for viability. Comparison of the IC50s results
revealed that the drug had a stronger effect on SW13 than
H295R cells (Figure 1C, 1D).
Once shown that metformin significantly affected
viability of both cell lines, we chose to focus on the effects in
H295R, since this cell model better represents the secreting
form of ACC. Inhibitory action of metformin was more
pronounced when assessed by direct cell count (Figure 2A)
than with MTS analysis; this suggests an additional effect
on cell proliferation, as further confirmed by thymidine
incorporation assay (Figure 2B). IC50s were calculated
from dose-response cell count (Figure 2C) and thymidine
uptake (Figure 2D) curves for each time point: coherently,
calculated IC50s decreased with increased treatment time.
Since in non-tumor cells metformin acts as a
hypoglycemic drug by facilitating glucose uptake and
its utilization, we next evaluated these properties in
the H295R cell line and found that metformin dosedependently stimulated a significant increase in cell basal
glucose uptake (Table 1).

Metformin activates the apoptotic process in
H295R cells
To investigate whether the reduced number of
cells following metformin treatment could be due
to an enhanced cell death, we next examined the
cascade of events underlying apoptosis in H295R
cells. Cytofluorimetric analysis of annexin V exposure
(Figure  4A), shows that 48 hour treatment of the
cells with increasing doses of metformin (10, 20,
50 mM) stimulates a dose-dependent increase in the
percentage of apoptotic cells, both in early and late
phases of the apoptotic process, compared with controls
(Figure  4A,  4B). This finding is associated with a
significant decrease in the number of living cells. Our
findings were confirmed by a protein array specifically
designed to assess the expression of the main proteins
involved in the apoptotic pathway. H295R cells treated
with 20 mM metformin for 48 hours expressed lower
levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, uncleaved caspase 3 and heat shock proteins HSP27, HSP60
and HSP70 (Figure 4C). Decreased IGF2 expression
was also observed, confirming the inhibitory effect of
metformin on the autocrine/paracrine IGF2/IGF-1R
system. Western blot analysis of the same protein extracts
revealed that 20 mM metformin inhibited Bcl-xl form
(Figure 4D) and activated caspase-3 by increasing the
cleaved fragments and decreasing the corresponding uncleaved form (Figure 4E).

treated group, which were smaller and well-circumscribed
(Figure 5C).
Histologically, the tumors from the controls
consisted of rather small, uniform cells with coarse
chromatin and prominent nucleoli. A haphazard
network of small-caliber vessels was also observed
(Figure  5D). Mitotic figures, both typical and atypical,
were numerous (Figure 5D, asterisks). Conversely, in the
metformin-treated group, the tumors showed decreased
vascularization, a greater number of apoptotic bodies
(arrowheads) and a lower mitotic activity (Figure 5E).
Foci of necrosis were occasionally seen (Figure 5E).
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that tumor
cells from both the controls (Figure 5F) and metformintreated (Figure 5G) mice stained intensely and diffusely
with SF-1, confirming that they were H295R-derived.
Metformin treatment (Figure 5I) was associated with a

In order to evaluate the in vivo metformin effect, we
monitored tumor growth in a mouse xenograft ACC model,
obtained by subcutaneously injecting H295R cells in the
two groups of athymic CD-1 nude mouse strain [15, 16],
one treated and one untreated with metformin (3mg/day)
for 40 days. Metformin administration was associated with
a statistically significant reduced increase in tumor volume
after 27 days compared with controls, (Figure 5A). After
15 days of treatment, the inhibitory effect (1-T/C = 76.2
± 8.4%) approached the maximum (89.8 ± 6.7%), which
was reached on day 27th and remained almost constant
until the animals were sacrificed (80.2 ± 14.0% inhibition
on day 40th).
Macroscopically, excided tumors from the control
group were larger, generally lobulated and highly

performed in vitro and in vivo on different types of solid
tumors [8] have shown that metformin also possesses antitumor properties. In particular, this drug interferes with
the insulin/IGF-1R system in tumor cells [8, 17] as shown
in pancreatic [10, 18, 19], breast [20, 21], endometrial
[22, 23], prostate [24] and lung [25] cancers. Due to the
rarity of ACC, no data are currently available regarding
cancer prevalence and metformin treatment in T2D, nor on
the effect metformin exerts on tumor growth. Our findings
demonstrate that metformin inhibits proliferation in the
adrenocortical cancer cell model H295R in association
with a decreased expression of the IGF2/IGF-1R system.
ACC is an endocrine tumor where the massive secretion of
IGF2 acts in an auto/paracrine loop to sustain cancer cell
proliferation, via activation of both insulin and IGF-1R
pro-survival intracellular pathways [26–28]. In H295R,
metformin induces a decrease in IGF2 and IGF-1R

reduction in nuclear Ki-67 reactivity, compared to the
controls (Figure 5H) (Ki-67 mean ± SEM: 55.1 ± 1.8
vs 74.8  ± 5.2 respectively; P < 0.02; 27% inhibition),
suggesting an inhibitory effect of metformin on tumor
proliferation.
Western blot analysis of protein extracts from
excised tumors confirmed the findings observed in vitro
in H295R (Figure 3A, 3B and 3E, 3F), that metforminin vivo treatment of the xenografted mice was associated
with an increased level of p-AMPK (Figure 5J) and a
decreased level of p-mTOR (Figure 5K).

DISCUSSION
Meta-analyses conducted on diabetic subjects
treated with metformin suggest a decreased incidence of
several types of cancer [6, 7]. Moreover, preclinical studies

expression. The inhibition of IGF-1R promoter activity
following metformin treatment could involve activation of
p53, pAMPK and E2F1 transcription factor, which among
the targets of metformin have been described to regulate
IGF-1R gene expression [22, 23, 29].
In H295R cells, we showed that the drug also
interferes with the intracellular ERK and mTOR
signaling pathways downstream from IGF-1R. We
previously demonstrated that another class of anti-diabetic
drugs, the thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone
and pioglitazone, inhibits adrenocortical cancer cell
proliferation [11] and stimulates cell differentiation
[31,  32]. These drugs also restrained cell proliferation
through IGF-1R signaling inhibition. However, while
rosiglitazone acts on inhibition of both pathways,
metformin seems to mainly affect ERK signaling, with no
significant effect on phosphorylation/activation of Akt. A
similar mechanism has been described in granulosa cells,
where metformin inhibits IGF-1-stimulated cell growth
through inhibition of ERK signaling and without affecting
Akt [33]. Furthermore, the key role of ERK1/2 in mediating
the anti-tumor effect of metformin has been confirmed by
a xenograft mouse model using neuroblastoma cell lines,
where a reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in
tumors of metformin-fed mice [34].
The inhibitory effect of metformin on cell growth
seems due not only to a reduction in cell proliferation
rate, but also to the stimulation of the mitochondrialdependent apoptotic pathway. Indeed, the complex I of
the mitochondrial respiratory chain is one of the main
cellular targets of metformin [8]. Metformin inhibition of
the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process reduces
mitochondrial production of ATP, thus inducing cell energy
stress and activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [8]. In
H295R cells, we demonstrated that metformin treatment is
associated with a dose-dependent increase of membrane
exposure of annexin V, one of the early events in the
apoptotic cascade. Protein array analysis also showed a
significant decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic
factors belonging to the family of Bcl-2, the key regulator
of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and of mitochondrial
integrity [35]. Induction of apoptosis finally results in
the activation of the caspase-3 effector [35], the cleaved
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

fragments of which become detectable in H295R cells
following metformin treatment.
Inhibition of OXOPHOS leads to a reduction in
the ATP/ADP ratio, thus activating the intracellular key
energy sensor AMPK [36, 37]. Activated AMPK mainly
interferes with mTOR activity by disrupting its association
with mTORC1 [38], finally resulting in a net cytostatic
effect. In metformin-treated H295R cells, we observed
an increased AMPK phosphorylation, associated with
a rapid glucose uptake, which is probably an adaptive
compensatory mechanism to fuel ATP production through
glycolysis. However, in breast cancer, mTOR inhibition
by metformin also blocks glycolytic and tricarboxylic
acid cycle intermediates necessary for cancer proliferation
[39], thus interfering with the Warburg effect [40].
Similarly, in H295R metformin-induced ERK inhibition
and AMPK activation may converge in mTOR blockage.
These findings suggest a metabolic switch from a mainly
anabolic to a mainly catabolic state to also support energy
requirements in the H295R cell line. The kinase protein
mTOR acts as a gatekeeper for metabolism and cell growth,
catching signals of cell stress, intracellular nutrient levels
and growth factors [41]. Besides the PI3K/Akt activation
pathway, which seems unaffected by metformin in H295R,
mTOR can form an alternative complex with mTORC1
following ERK1/2 activation [42–44], thus specifically
mediating the IGF-1/insulin proliferative pathway [12].
Metformin also induces a significant reduction in
the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) involved in
tumorigenesis [45]. The high rate of anabolic processes
sustaining cancer cell proliferation and progression in a
ROS-rich environment requires a high chaperone activity
to ensure a correct protein folding process. Increased
HSPs expression has been observed in various types of
malignancies [46], including adrenocortical cancer [47].
In particular, HSP27, 60 and 70 play a pivotal role in
dampening the apoptotic processes at mitochondrial level
[45, 48], thus representing promising anti-tumor targets
for the development of anti-cancer drugs. Here, we have
demonstrated that metformin treatment leads to reduced
HSP27/60/70 expression in H295R cells, which may
contribute to the stimulatory effect of the drug on adrenal
cancer cell apoptosis.

The in vitro anti-proliferative effect of metformin in
preclinical models is obtained by using higher doses than
those reached in diabetic patients [49], thus apparently
limiting its potential use in cancer treatment. However, in
some tissues, metformin can accumulate at concentrations
several-times higher than those found in the bloodstream
[50], as demonstrated for the adrenal gland and liver [51].
The adrenal gland is in fact one of the tissues expressing
the highest levels of the organic cation transporters 1 (Oct
1) and 3 (Oct 3) [52], which are responsible for metformin
cellular uptake and for its high concentration in this organ
[53]. Moreover, due to the high charge of the molecule,
metformin specifically concentrates in mitochondria
[36]. Thus, it is conceivable that the current metformin
dosage used in T2D treatment, despite the micromolar
levels reached in the plasma, could reach up to millimolar
levels in actively absorbing organs, such as the adrenal
cortex. We demonstrated a significant decrease in both
tumor growth rate and H295R cell proliferation within the
tumor mass in metformin-treated ACC xenografted mice,
associated with an increase in AMPK and a decrease in
mTOR phosphorylation similar to that observed for
in vitro-treated H295R. These results were obtained
in vivo employing a metformin dosage very similar to that
used in diabetic patients and in line with the literature on
rodent tumor xenograft models [54, 55], supporting the
hypothesis of metformin concentration in the ACC tumor.
Several clinical trials, specifically designed with
endpoints and outcomes allowing exploration of the anticancer properties of metformin, are currently ongoing
[https://clinicaltrials.gov]. They will also serve to clarify
the doses at which metformin exerts its anti-cancer effects
compared with its anti-diabetic properties. Further studies
are necessary to evaluate a possible combined therapy with
mitotane, also proven to affect mitochondrial function in
H295R [56, 57], to reduce the dosage of both drugs together.
In conclusion, our findings provide the first
preclinical report on the anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effect of metformin in ACC and help to
elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways involved.
Mitochondrial functions and integrity are also the
key targets for the anti-cancer activity of this drug in
adrenocortical cancer cells. Further studies are necessary
to validate these findings in vivo and better clarify the
intracellular mechanisms involved in metformin activity,
whilst proposing the prospective use of metformin in
adrenocortical cancer therapy.

Xenograft model for tumor growth assessment

Glucose uptake measurement

Female athymic CD1 nude mice (9 week-old,
Charles River Laboratories, Italy) were inoculated
subcutaneously with H295R cell suspension (7 × 106
cells/100 µl). Almost all H295R injected mice developed
a detectable tumor except one (84% overall tumor take
rate), confirming the aggressiveness of ACC derived cells.
Tumor growth was monitored daily and once solid tumors
reached a 5 mm mean diameter the animals were randomly
assigned to intraperitoneal injection of metformin (3 mg in
100 µl PBS/day, 6 days/week) or vehicle. Tumor volume
(mm3) was monitored 3 times a week by two independent
investigators and was calculated by using the following
formula: length x width2/2. Anti-tumor activity of the
drug was evaluated in terms of tumor growth inhibition
percentage, calculated by 1-Treated/Control tumor volume
ratios (1-T/C) [58]. Data were expressed as mean ± SE.
Drug tolerability in tumor-bearing mice was
assessed in terms of: a) lethal toxicity, i.e. any death in
treated mice occurring before any death in control mice; b)
body weight loss percentage = 100 – (body weight on day
x/body weight on day 1) × 100, where x represents a day
after or during the treatment period [58].
Animal studies were performed in compliance
with an institutionally approved protocol and with the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals.

H295R cells seeded in 12-well plates (1 × 10 cells/
well) and grown up to confluence, were washed twice with
PBS and t incubated overnight in a serum free, low glucose
medium (0.55 mM). Cells were treated in the absence
(control) or presence of increasing doses of metformin
for 24 hours. After PBS-wash, cells were incubated with
Hepes buffer (140 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes-Na pH 7.4,
2.5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl) containing
2-deoxy-[3H]D-glucose [1μCi/μl] for 10 minutes at 37°C.
After wash with cold PBS, cells were lysed in 100 mM
NaOH for 1 hour at 37°C. Radioactivity was measured by
a scintillation beta counter.

SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis
Treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM
Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton-100, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF) and, after protein measurement
by Comassie method, equal amounts of proteins for
each sample (30 µg) were separated by SDS–PAGE and
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon, Merck
Millipore). Each membrane was incubated overnight
at 4°C with primary antibodies at the appropriate
dilutions, then with peroxidase-secondary IgG (1:2000)
at room temperature for 1 hour. Image acquisition and
densitometric analysis were performed with Quantity
One software on a ChemiDoc XRS instrument (BIORAD Labs, CA, USA). All Western blots were repeated
in at least 3 independent experiments. Actin was used as
internal loading control to normalize protein expression.

Histological and immunohistochemical
examination of xenografts
Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and
paraffin-embedded. Five-micrometer sections were
hematoxylin and eosin (H/E) stained for histologic
evaluation or used for immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemical analysis with mouse anti-human
Ki-67 monoclonal (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was
performed with the Ventana Benchmark XT system
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA). Nuclei were
hematoxylin counterstained. Ki-67 positive nuclei were
counted on 1000 tumor cells in 3 tumors for each group.
Negative controls were performed by omitting the primary
antibodies. Immunohistochemical analysis with rabbit antihuman SF-1 polyclonal IgG (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA)
was performed with the Ventana Benchmark XT system
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA).

Apoptotic evaluation by Muse™ cytofluorimetric
analysis
After 72 h treatment with increasing doses of
metformin (0, 10, 20, 50 mM), H295R cells were
trypsinized and analyzed with a Muse™ automated cell
analyzer (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for
apoptosis detection using the Muse™ Annexin V/Dead
Cell (cat # MCH100105, Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA) assay, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells treated for 2 hours with 2 µM staurosporine were
used as positive control for apoptosis induction.

on the pharmacokinetics of mitotane. Pharmacogenet
Genomics. 2013; 23:293–300.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
22.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). The
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to verify the normal
distribution of data which were then expressed as mean
± SE. One way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Dunnett’s
test was applied for multiple comparisons, while Student’s
t test was employed for comparing the two classes of
data shown in figures. A P < 0.05 value was considered
statistically significant. The half Inhibitory Concentration
(IC50) of metformin was calculated on cell count, MTS
and thymidine-incorporation dose-response curves using
Origin software 6.1 version (OriginLab Corporation,
Northampton, MA).
