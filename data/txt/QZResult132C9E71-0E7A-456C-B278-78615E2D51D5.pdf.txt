Abstract
Selective kinase inhibitors have had a substantial impact on
the field of medical oncology. Whereas these agents can elicit
dramatic clinical responses in some settings, their activity is
generally limited to a subset of treated patients whose tumor
cells harbor a specific genetic lesion. We have established an
automated platform for examining the sensitivity to various
molecularly targeted inhibitors across a large panel of human
tumor-derived cell lines to identify additional genotypecorrelated responses that may be clinically relevant. Among
the inhibitors tested in a panel of 602 cell lines derived from a
variety of human cancers, we found that a selective inhibitor
of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) potently suppressed
growth of a small subset of tumor cells. This subset included
lines derived from anaplastic large cell lymphomas, non–
small-cell lung cancers, and neuroblastomas. ALK is a
receptor tyrosine kinase that was first identified as part of a
protein fusion derived from a chromosomal translocation
detected in the majority of anaplastic large cell lymphoma
patients, and has recently been implicated as an oncogene in a
small fraction of non–small-cell lung cancers and neuroblastomas. Significantly, sensitivity in these cell lines was well
correlated with specific ALK genomic rearrangements, including chromosomal translocations and gene amplification.
Moreover, in such cell lines, ALK kinase inhibition can lead
to potent suppression of downstream survival signaling and
an apoptotic response. These findings suggest that a subset of
lung cancers, lymphomas, and neuroblastomas that harbor
genomic ALK alterations may be clinically responsive to
pharmacologic ALK inhibition. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3389–95]

Introduction
Tyrosine kinases are now widely recognized as attractive
proteins for molecularly targeted cancer therapy. The clinical
success of several selective kinase inhibitors including imatinib,
erlotinib, sunitinib, and lapatinib has shown that this strategy may
be broadly applicable to a variety of hematologic and epithelial
malignancies. However, it is also becoming clear that such

treatments are largely beneficial to a subset of patients whose
tumor cells harbor activating mutations of genes encoding the
target kinase (1). Thus, imatinib, which inhibits the ABL, KIT, and
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor kinases, is effective
in chronic myelogenous leukemias, which harbor the BCR-ABL
oncogenic kinase fusion, and in gastrointestinal tumors that harbor
mutationally activated KIT or PDGF receptors (2). Similarly, most
non–small-cell lung cancer patients that respond to the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor erlotinib harbor
activating EGFR mutations (3). Ongoing cancer genome analyses
continue to reveal novel genetic lesions that give rise to activated
kinases in a variety of cancers, and many of these may represent
attractive targets for therapy.
We have recently reported the development of an automated
high-throughput platform for profiling a very large panel of human
tumor-derived cell lines to identify subsets that exhibit exquisite
sensitivity to a variety of molecularly targeted inhibitors with
potential anticancer activity (4). Those findings showed the power
of this strategy to reveal genotype-correlated sensitivities that may
be useful in guiding clinical testing of novel therapeutic
compounds. Here, we describe the profiling of 602 cancer cell
lines for sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of the anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK), a receptor tyrosine kinase first identified
as part of an NPM-ALK fusion protein expressed in a subset of
patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (5). Our studies
revealed that a small subset of cell lines harboring ALK gene
alterations are highly sensitive to ALK inhibition (5, 6). These
include cells derived from non–small-cell lung cancers and
anaplastic large cell lymphomas, where ALK translocations have
previously been reported, as well as from neuroblastomas, where
ALK gene amplification has been described (7, 8). Our findings
indicate that selective ALK kinase inhibitors may be useful in the
clinical management of a subset of patients with diverse tumor
types that harbor ALK gene alterations.

Materials and Methods
Human cancer cell lines and cell viability assays. Human cancer cell
lines were obtained from commercial vendors and were maintained and
tested for viability using an automated platform, as previously described (4).
Protein detection. Immunodetection of proteins following SDS-PAGE
was done using standard protocols. Equal lane loading was assessed using a
h-tubulin antibody (Sigma). The Akt, ALK, extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (Erk)-1/2, phospho-Erk1/2 (T202/Y204), phospho-ALK (Y1604), signal
transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phospho-STAT3
(S727) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. The phospho-Akt
(S473) antibody was from BioSource International. The poly(ADP-ribose)

polymerase antibody was from BD Biosciences. All antibodies were used at
a 1:1,000 dilution, except for the h-tubulin antibody, which was used at
1:10,000 dilution.
Kinase inhibitors. TAE684 and BMS-536924 were synthesized as
previously described (9, 10). PF-2341066 was synthesized at Pfizer
Pharmaceuticals. WZ-5-126 is a recently developed inhibitor with selective
ALK inhibitory activity,5 and the in vitro profile of inhibitory activity against
a panel of kinases was done by Ambit Biosciences (Supplementary Table S1).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were pulsed with 10 Amol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 1 to 2 h before collection, centrifuged to remove
supernatant, and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol. The cells were washed with
PBS/0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated in denaturing
solution (2 mol/L HCl) for 20 min at room temperature. After a further wash
with PBS/0.5% BSA, the cells were resuspended in 0.1 mol/L sodium borate
for 2 min at room temperature. After an additional wash, the cells were
suspended in anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody for 20 min (1:500; Becton
Dickinson) per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed in PBS/0.5%
BSA and the pellet was resuspended in FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG
(1:50; Vector Laboratories) for 20 min. After an additional wash in PBS/0.5%
BSA, the cells were stained with 10 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Sigma) and
treated with RNase A (Sigma) before two-dimensional fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
RNAi studies. Two shRNA species targeting sequences downstream of
the common ALK breakpoint were expressed from the pLKO1 lentiviral
vector (target sequences: 5¶-GTGATAAATACAAGGCCCAGA-3¶ and 5¶GAGCTGGTCATTACGAGGATA-3¶). Cells were infected with the viruses
overnight in the presence of polybrene (8 Ag/mL) and then maintained in
the presence of 2 Ag/mL puromycin for an additional 6 days. A cell line
resistant to the ALK inhibitor (A549) was used to show the infection
efficiency and specificity of the effect seen in the NCH-H3122 and KELLY
cell lines.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two-color fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) was done on 3:1 methanol/acetic acid–fixed cell lines
or on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue using the LSI ALK
Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbott-Vysis) following the
manufacturer’s protocols. Images were captured with an Olympus BX61
fluorescent microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera, and
analysis was done with Cytovision software (Applied Imaging).
PCR detection of ALK fusion products. RNA was extracted from cell
lines using RNA STAT-60 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TelTest, Inc.) and reverse transcription was carried out with the AffinityScript
Multi-Temperature cDNA Synthesis kit (Stratagene). PCR was then done
using the AmpliTaq Gold PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primer
sequences are listed in Supplementary Fig. S1.
DNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from cell lines using the
Gentra purification system according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
entire ALK coding sequence (exons 1–29) was amplified from genomic DNA
by PCR with primers (Supplementary Fig. S2). PCR products were purified
and subjected to bidirectional sequencing using BigDye v1.1 (Applied
Biosystems) in combination with an ABI3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Electropherograms were analyzed using Sequence Navigator
software (Applied Biosystems).
Data analysis. The sensitivity of each cell line to various concentrations
of kinase inhibitors was calculated as the fraction of viable cells relative to
untreated cells. Data were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using
GraphPad Prism Software version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) to obtain
IC50 values.

Results and Discussion
A small subset of human cancer cell lines are sensitive to a
selective ALK kinase inhibitor. Using an automated platform to
examine drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines (4), we tested the

sensitivity of 602 established cancer cell lines derived from a wide
variety of tumor types (Supplementary Fig. S3) to TAE684, a
selective inhibitor of the ALK kinase (9). Cells were treated for 72
hours with a range of TAE684 concentrations and then assayed for
potential cytostatic or cytotoxic responses. Whereas the vast
majority of tested cell lines were largely refractory to treatment, a
small subset of lines (f2%) displayed marked sensitivity to
TAE684, as indicated by a significant reduction in cell number
following treatment (Fig. 1A).
The subset of TAE684-sensitive cells was notably enriched with
cell lines derived from non–small-cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma,
and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, tumor types where genomic
ALK activation has previously been reported (5, 6, 8, 11).
Chromosomal translocations involving gene sequences encoding
the intracellular domain of ALK have been detected in anaplastic
large cell lymphoma (50–60%), inflammatory myofibroblastic
tumors (27%), and non–small-cell lung cancer (7%; refs. 5, 12).
The majority of ALK translocations involve a common breakpoint
that yields a fusion protein comprising the complete intracellular
portion of ALK, including the kinase domain. At least 15 different
ALK fusion partners have been discovered in human cancers, and
in each case, the NH2-terminal region of the protein contains an
oligomerization domain, which is believed to cause dimerization of
the fusion protein and ALK kinase–mediated autophosphorylation
(13). Activating point mutations of ALK have not been reported.
TAE684-sensitive non-small-cell lung cancer–derived cell
lines harbor genomic ALK rearrangements. Among 134 non–
small-cell lung cancer cell lines tested with TAE684, substantial
drug sensitivity was observed in three of the lines (Fig. 1A).
Interphase FISH analysis with an ALK FISH probe revealed that of
the three TAE684-sensitive cell lines, the two most sensitive cell
lines (NCI-H2228 and NCI-H3122) displayed unbalanced rearrangements of ALK signified by loss of the 5¶ centromeric (green signal)
and extra copies of the 3¶ telomeric (red signal) portions of the gene
(Fig. 1B). In addition, immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing an epitope in the preserved 3¶ end of ALK revealed that both
lines express significant levels of a protein considerably smaller
than the expected 200-kDa full-length ALK protein (Fig. 1C). To
determine the identity of the 5¶ fusion partners in both cell lines,
we carried out PCR analysis using primers 5¶ and 3¶ to the common
translocation breakpoint in eight known fusion partners and ALK,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4). There was no evidence of
either of the EML4-ALK fusion mRNAs (variant 1 or 2) previously
detected in non–small-cell lung cancer patients in the NCI-H2228
cell line (6), and the identity of the fusion partner in this line
remains unknown. However, in the NCI-H3122 cell line, we
detected the EML4-ALK variant 1 fusion mRNA in which intron
13 of EML4 is fused to intron 20 of ALK. The HCC-78 cell line,
which displayed moderate TAE684 sensitivity, does not seem to
harbor ALK gene abnormalities or detectable ALK protein
expression, and thus the basis for its sensitivity is not known
(data not shown). Significantly, a very recent study of global
phosphotyrosine signaling in a large panel of lung cancer cell lines
and primary tumors identified a chromosomal translocation in
HCC-78 cells that yields a fusion protein containing the kinase
domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase ROS, which is activated (14).
The fact that there is a high level of homology between the kinase
domains of ALK and ROS raises the possibility that the TAE684
sensitivity of HCC-78 cells reflects the inhibition of ROS signaling.
In both non–small-cell lung cancer lines with ALK gene
rearrangements, ALK protein was expressed and phosphorylated,

and phosphorylation was completely abolished following treatment
with TAE684. Thus, the ALK kinase seems to have become
activated by virtue of genomic rearrangement in these cells.
Autophosphorylation of ALK leads to the activation of multiple
signaling pathways that contribute to cell survival and transformation (15). Significantly, treatment of each of these lines with

TAE684 resulted in a dramatic inhibition of Akt and Erk1/2
phosphorylation (Fig. 1D), suggesting that ALK activation in these
cells is coupled to the engagement of downstream survival
effectors.
ALK shares a high degree of homology with the insulin-like
growth factor receptor (IGF-IR), which has also been implicated

in tumorigenesis (16), and significant expression of IGF-IR was
detected in both of the TAE684-sensitive non–small-cell lung
cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C). However, treatment of both lines with
an IGF-IR inhibitor, BMS-536924 (IC50 100 nmol/L), had no effect
on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S5). Moreover, these cells
were similarly sensitive to another selective ALK inhibitor, WZ-5126 (IC50 3.4 nmol/L; Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that
the observed effects of TAE684 in these cells are mediated
through ALK inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S5). Cell cycle
analysis of the NCI-H3122 cell line following treatment with
TAE684 revealed a dramatic increase in the sub-G1 apoptotic
fraction of cells as early as 24 hours after treatment, suggesting

a cytotoxic response to ALK inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S6A).
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage was also evident in this
cell line following treatment with TAE684 (Fig. 1E). Notably, the
TAE684 response in the NCI-H2228 cell line seems to be
cytostatic rather than apoptotic (data not shown). Thus, ALK
kinase inhibition in tumor cells harboring ALK genomic lesions
may lead to either a cytostatic or cytotoxic outcome, potentially
depending on additional genetic features.
TAE684 sensitivity in neuroblastoma cells correlates with
ALK gene amplification and rearrangement. The cell line
profiling data also revealed a preponderance of neuroblastomaderived cell lines among the most TAE684-sensitive lines (Fig. 1A).

ALK expression has previously been reported in a large fraction of
neuroblastomas (11), and rare cases of ALK gene amplification
have also been described (7, 8). Therefore, we examined the 17
neuroblastoma cell lines that were screened with the ALK inhibitor
using an ALK FISH probe to detect gene rearrangements. Two of
the most TAE684-sensitive cell lines showed either ALK gene
rearrangement (KELLY) or substantial amplification of intact ALK
(NB-1; Fig. 2A). Although FISH analysis of the KELLY line revealed a
clear chromosomal split within the ALK gene, the molecular nature
of the gene rearrangement remains unknown. Curiously, phosphorylated ALK was difficult to detect in the KELLY cell line,
suggesting that very low levels of protein may be driving
downstream signaling in these cells. However, KELLY cells, as well
as H3122 non–small-cell lung cancer cells, were effectively killed
following infection with either of the two different lentiviruses that
encode ALK-specific shRNAs, confirming the requirement for ALK
in these cells (Fig. 2B). Cell cycle analysis of the KELLY cell line
following treatment with TAE684 revealed a small but significant
increase in the sub-G1 apoptotic fraction of cells as early as

www.aacrjournals.org

24 hours after treatment, suggesting a cytotoxic response to ALK
inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Furthermore, TAE684 treatment potently suppressed Akt and
Erk1/2 phosphorylation in the KELLY and NB-1 cell lines (Fig. 2C).
Thus, in these cell lines with genomic ALK alterations, ALK
signaling seems to be coupled to key downstream survival
effectors. Moreover, as early as 6 hours after treatment with
TAE684, there was evidence of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
cleavage in the NB-1 cell line (Fig. 2C), indicating that, as in
non–small-cell lung cancer cells harboring ALK translocations,
neuroblastoma cells with activated ALK also undergo an apoptotic
response to kinase inactivation by TAE684. Previous studies that
made use of ALK-specific siRNAs to reduce ALK protein expression
showed a similar requirement for ALK in a neuroblastoma cell line
exhibiting ALK gene amplification (7).
To assess the potential clinical significance of these cell line
findings in primary neuroblastomas, we used FISH to detect ALK
gene abnormalities in 10 pediatric neuroblastoma samples. Among
the 10 cases analyzed, we identified 1 case with marked

amplification of ALK, similar to that seen in the NB-1 cell line
(Fig. 2D). Although this represents a small sample size, a previous
report identified ALK gene amplification in 8 of 85 primary
neuroblastoma specimens, suggesting an f10% frequency of this
genotype in human neuroblastomas (7).
Surprisingly, the most TAE684-sensitive neuroblastoma cell line
identified in our panel, SH-SY5Y, showed no evidence of either ALK
gene rearrangement by FISH or ALK coding sequence mutation by
DNA sequencing (data not shown). However, TAE684 treatment of
these cells effectively suppressed Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation
(Fig. 2C). Significantly, a separate analysis of tumor cell sensitivity
to the IGF-IR inhibitor BMS-536924 in 256 cell lines from a variety
of tissue types revealed that, as with TAE684, the majority of cell
lines were drug resistant, but SH-SY5Y was notably among the most
sensitive cell lines (Fig. 3A). As mentioned above, the ALK kinase
domain exhibits a high degree of sequence homology with the IGFIR kinase, and TAE684 inhibits phosphorylation of IGF-IR in
in vitro kinase assays at concentrations of 10 to 20 nmol/L (9). In
addition to expressing ALK, a large fraction of the neuroblastoma
cell lines also express IGF-IR (Fig. 3B). Although KELLY and SHSY5Y both express significant levels of IGF-IR, a comparison of
their sensitivities to TAE684, WZ-5-126, and BMS-536924 showed
that in KELLY cells the predominant target of TAE684 is ALK,
whereas in the SH-SY5Y cell line it appears to be IGF-IR (data not
shown). Indeed, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with the IGF-IR

inhibitor BMS-536924 resulted in a dramatic suppression of Akt
phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Previous studies have also implicated
IGF-IR as a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma cells,
including SH-SY5Y cells (17). We also noted that two of the
neuroblastoma lines without obvious ALK gene alterations (SK-NFI and SK-N-SH) exhibited TAE684 sensitivity but did not respond
to BMS-536924, raising the possibility that these cells harbor more
subtle ALK lesions or that another target of TAE684 confers
sensitivity in those lines. Taken altogether, these findings suggest
that a subset of neuroblastomas with ALK gene amplification or
rearrangement may be clinically responsive to selective ALK kinase
inhibitors. Moreover, our findings raise the possibility that a dual
inhibitor of ALK and IGF-IR, such as TAE684, may be clinically
active in a subset of neuroblastomas that includes those with either
ALK or IGF-IR dependency.
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma–derived cells with ALK
translocations are sensitive to ALK kinase inhibition. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is the tumor type where ALK translocations
have been most frequently detected (5). Our cell line profiling
screen with TAE684 included two anaplastic large cell lymphoma–
derived cell lines (SU-DHL-1 and Karpas-299), and both have
previously been shown to express a fusion protein resulting from
the NPM-ALK translocation. Significantly, these lines were among
the most TAE684-sensitive cell lines detected in our screen
(Fig. 1A), and we confirmed the presence of the NPM-ALK

translocation in these cells by both PCR and FISH analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Furthermore, TAE684 potently suppressed
cell viability and ALK phosphorylation, as well as the phosphorylation of downstream survival effectors, in both lines (Fig. 4A and B).
Because TAE684 is currently not being tested as a clinical agent,
we also examined the activity of PF-2341066, a dual MET/ALK
kinase inhibitor currently undergoing phase I clinical testing (18).
In the two anaplastic large cell lymphoma lines tested, as well as
the neuroblastoma line NB-1, PF-2341066 was able to inhibit
proliferation and ALK-mediated signaling in these cell lines at
clinically achievable doses, although the inhibitory effects were not
as substantial as those seen with TAE684 (Fig. 4A and B). Moreover,
potent suppression of Akt and Erk signaling was also seen in
PF-2341066–treated NB-1 neuroblastoma cells. Similar trends in
sensitivity to both TAE684 and PF-2341066 were also evident in the
non–small-cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H3122 and the neuroblastoma line KELLY (Supplementary Fig. S8). Together, our cell line
findings suggest that ALK gene rearrangements associated with
specific chromosomal translocations or gene amplification are well
correlated with sensitivity to selective ALK kinase inhibition, and
that clinical testing of PF-2341066 in anaplastic large cell
lymphoma, non–small-cell lung cancer, and neuroblastoma may
be warranted.
Concluding remarks. Our collective observations from cell line
profiling analysis with the selective ALK kinase inhibitor TAE684
have revealed that a subset of human cancer-derived cell lines
harboring ALK gene rearrangements and/or amplifications are
exquisitely sensitive to ALK kinase inhibition (Supplementary
Fig. S9). Moreover, in these cells, ALK activation seems to be
coupled to critical downstream survival effectors including Erk and

Akt. Although the correlation between TAE684 sensitivity and ALK
gene status among cell lines was strong, it was not perfect,
suggesting that ALK genomic status may not be the sole determinant
of sensitivity to kinase inhibition. Moreover, because it was not
readily feasible to examine the ALK genomic status in all of the cell
lines in our large panel, it is possible that there are additional tumor
cells with ALK activation that did not score as TAE684 sensitive.
However, the overall findings suggest that clinical studies of selective
ALK kinase inhibitors are likely to benefit from preselection of
patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, non–small-cell lung
cancer, or neuroblastoma whose tumors exhibit ALK gene
amplification or translocation. The identification of a kinase
activation event that contributes to oncogenicity in three diverse
human cancer types, including both hematologic and solid tumors,
is unusual, and highlights the potential importance of considering
specific genotypes, as opposed to tissue types, in future strategies to
develop and clinically evaluate molecularly targeted cancer drugs.
