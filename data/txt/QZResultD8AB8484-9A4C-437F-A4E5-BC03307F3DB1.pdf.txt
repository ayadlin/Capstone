Abstract
With the demonstration of improved survival of some acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) patients with the CD33 antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin
(GO), CD33 has been validated as a target for antigen-specific immunotherapy.
Since previous studies identified a CD33 splice variant missing exon 2 (CD33∆E2) and,
consequently, the immune-dominant membrane-distal V-set domain, we investigated
the expression and functional characteristics of CD33 transcript variants in AML. In
primary AML specimens, we not only found full-length CD33 (CD33FL) and CD33∆E2
but also corresponding variants containing an alternate exon 7 predicted to encode
a CD33 protein lacking most of the intracellular domain (CD33E7a and, not previously
described, CD33∆E2,E7a) in almost all cases. In acute leukemia cell sublines engineered
to express individual CD33 splice variants, all splice variants had endocytic properties.
CD33FL and CD33E7a mediated similar degrees of GO cytotoxicity, whereas CD33∆E2
and CD33∆E2,E7a could not serve as target for GO. Co-expression of CD33∆E2 did not
interfere with CD33FL endocytosis and did not impact CD33FL-mediated GO cytotoxicity.
Together, our findings document a greater-than-previously thought complexity of
CD33 expression in human AML. They identify CD33 variants that lack exon 2 and are
not recognized by current CD33-directed therapeutics as potential target for future
unconjugated or conjugated antibodies.

INTRODUCTION

domain, and a cytoplasmic tail that contains 2 conserved
tyrosine-based inhibitory signaling motifs. Upon
phosphorylation, the latter provide docking sites for the
recruitment and activation of the Src homology-2 (SH2)
domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and
SHP-2 [1]. Increasing evidence suggests that CD33 and
related Siglecs with inhibitory signaling motifs modulate
inflammatory and immune responses through dampening
of tyrosine kinase-driven signaling pathways [2]. For
CD33, the precise physiological functions have remained
unclear, but recently, genome-wide association studies

CD33, a member of the sialic acid-binding
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectin (Siglec) family, is a
67 kD single pass transmembrane glycoprotein with
endocytic properties that is primarily expressed on normal
multipotent myeloid precursors, unipotent colony-forming
cells, and maturing granulocytes and monocytes [1]. CD33
is comprised of an amino-terminal variable (V)-set Ig-like
domain mediating sialic acid binding followed by a C2-set
Ig-like domain in its extracellular region, a transmembrane

the ability of CD33FL to serve as a target for therapeutic
antibodies.

have identified variants of CD33 as a major risk factor
for Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting an important role in
neurodegeneration [2].
Restricted expression patterns render Siglecs
appealing targets for antibody- and glycan-based
therapeutics [3]. Consistent with its characteristic as a
myeloid differentiation antigen, CD33 is expressed on
at least a subset of malignant blasts in nearly all patients
with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and also, perhaps,
in underlying leukemia stem cells in some cases [1, 4].
There has therefore been a long-standing interest in
the development of CD33-directed unconjugated and
conjugated monoclonal antibodies for the treatment
of AML. To date, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a
humanized CD33 antibody conjugated to a calicheamicin-γ1
derivative, has had the most success in the clinic. Several
randomized trials have demonstrated that the addition of
GO to induction chemotherapy reduces the relapse risk and
improves survival of adults with newly diagnosed AML and
favorable- or intermediate-risk features [5]. These studies
are complemented by a large Children’s Oncology Group
(COG) trial of > 1,000 pediatric patients in which GO
reduced the relapse risk and improved event-free survival
irrespective of the cytogenetic disease risk [6]. Although
GO was withdrawn from the commercial market in most
countries in 2010, these results have validated CD33
as therapeutic target in AML and have sparked renewed
interest in CD33-directed immunotherapies [1].
UCSC genome browser and Ensembl databases
contain 3 unique, validated CD33 transcript variants
supported by at least one non-suspect mRNA sequence,
NM_001772, NM_001082618 and NM_001177608.
NM_001772 represents full-length CD33 (CD33FL)
consisting of 7 coding exons and a 364 amino acid protein
[7]. NM_001082618 skips exon 2 resulting in CD33
with a deleted exon 2 (CD33∆E2) and a 237 amino acid
protein [8–11]. NM_001177608 uses an alternate exon
7, exon 7a (CD33E7a) [10], which is predicted to encode
an early translational stop, resulting in a 310 amino
acid protein with truncation of the 54 c-terminal amino
acids of the intracellular domain relative to CD33FL. The
existence of CD33 variants lacking exon 2 is relevant for
therapeutic targeting of CD33 since the V-set domain,
which is encoded by exon 2, contains immune-dominant
epitope(s) [8, 12] recognized by all currently clinically
exploited CD33-directed therapeutics. Moreover, our
previous studies in cell lines engineered to express mutant
forms of CD33 demonstrated that CD33 endocytosis
is largely limited and determined by the intracellular
domain of CD33 and that changes in this domain
significantly impact CD33 internalization [13–15]. It is
therefore conceivable that transcript variants that lack
most of the intracellular domain of CD33 differ in their
endocytic properties from the wild-type protein. Here,
we investigated to what degree CD33 transcript variants
are found in AML, what the endocytic properties are of

RESULTS
Expression of CD33 splice variants in primary
AML specimens
To survey the pattern of CD33 splice variant
expression in human AML, we took advantage of
whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data
from 61 pre-treatment bone marrow and 7 peripheral
blood specimens collected from pediatric patients with
newly diagnosed AML. CD33 coding sequence splice
junctions were filtered for junctions with 10% prevalence
at a threshold of ≥ 10 reads per specimen, resulting in 8
observed splice junctions (E1/E2, E1/E3, E2/E3, E3/E4,
E4/E5, E5/E6, E6/E7a, E6/E7b; Figure 1A). These 8 splice
junctions were consistent with the 3 known and wellsupported protein coding CD33 transcripts (NM_001772,
NM_001082618, and NM_001177608; Figure 1B).
Of the 8 junctions, 6 were shared by 2 or more known
CD33 variants, whereas 2 were unique to one of two
variants, NM_001082618 (E1/E3; specific for CD33∆E2)
and NM_001177608 (E6/E7a; specific for CD33E7a). The
latter 2 were found in 57/68 (85.3%) and 55/68 (80.9%)
of the specimens (Figure 1C). The observed CD33
splice junctions in our RNAseq dataset also offered the
possibility of a previously unknown fourth, distinct CD33
transcript that lacked exon 2 and used exon E7a instead of
E7b (CD33∆E2,E7a).
To further study CD33 variants in human AML
and validate the findings obtained with RNAseq, we
designed transcript-specific primers and used RT-PCR to
assess expression of the CD33FL, CD33∆E2, CD33E7a, and
CD33∆E2,E7a transcripts in 29 pre-treatment specimens from
adults with AML. Basic characteristics of these specimens
are summarized in Table 1. In the majority of specimens
(27/29 [93.1%]), amplicons corresponding to the expected
sizes of all 4 CD33 transcripts were found, whereas
in the remaining 2 specimens (6.9%; samples #14 and
#21), only 3 transcripts (CD33FL, CD33∆E2, and CD33E7a)
were detectable (Figure 2). Three unique amplicons per
CD33 transcript were subjected to Sanger sequencing to
confirm the lack of exon 2 in CD33∆E2, use of exon 7a in
CD33E7a, and lack of exon 2 combined with use of exon
7a in CD33∆E2,E7a; the latter sequence was subsequently
deposited in GenBank (accession no. KX139463). In 7
cases, we had bone marrow specimens (containing AML
cells) and paired peripheral blood specimens (without
morphologic evidence of AML cells) available that were
obtained on the same day. In all cases, the pattern of CD33
isoform expression was very similar in the peripheral
blood and the marrow specimen, i.e. all CD33 isoforms
could be identified in non-blast cells.

Figure 1: RNA sequencing to identify CD33 splice variants in human AML. (A) Summary of RNAseq results from 68 AML

specimens, with provision of CD33 exon/exon boundaries (column 1) and known transcripts containing these specific exon/exon boundaries
(column 2). Also indicated is the number of specimens with a positive read for each junction (columns 3) as well as total reads (columns 4).
(B) Genomic structure of CD33FL and CD33 splice variants. Located at chromosome 19q13.41, CD33FL encodes an amino-terminus
signal peptide (SP) of 16 AA (exon 1), a sialic acid-binding amino-terminal V-set Ig-like domain (V, exon 2), a C2-set Ig-like domain
(C2, exon 3 and 4), a transmembrane domain (TM, exon 5), and an intracellular domain (ID, exon 6 and 7a or 7b). Besides CD33FL, RNAseq
suggested our studies identified 3 CD33 mRNA transcript variants, including two reported splice variants, CD33∆E2 and CD33E7a, and a
previously unknown variant, CD33∆E2,E7a. Skipped exons (dotted lines) and approximate location of variant specific primers are indicated.
(C) Functional domains of CD33FL and CD33 splice variants. CD33∆E2 lacks 124 amino acids encoded by exon 2 and, as a result, the V-set
domain, while CD33E7a lacks 54 carboxy-terminal amino acids due to an early translation stop signal residing in exon 7a. CD33∆E2,E7a lacks
both exon 2 and the 54 carboxy-terminal amino acids. Exon/exon boundaries were confirmed through gel extraction of PCR products
shown, subsequent purification, and sequence analysis.

Generation of cell line models to study CD33
splice variants

virally-transduced HEK293T cells (Figure 4). As shown in
Figure 5, engineered sublines expressed high amounts of
CD33FL and CD33E7a in all cell lines. Lentivirus-mediated
gene transfer also resulted in readily detectable cell surface
display of the CD33∆E2 and CD33∆E2,E7a splice variants,
although the level of expression varied considerably
across cell line backgrounds.

Having demonstrated the presence of CD33∆E2,
CD33E7a, and CD33∆E2,E7a mRNA in primary human
AML cells, we then studied the functional characteristics
of encoded proteins. Therefore, we generated cell line
models of human acute leukemia in which we selectively
expressed untagged or His-tagged CD33FL, CD33∆E2,
CD33E7a or CD33∆E2,E7a via lentivirus-mediated gene
transfer, using a series of human AML (KG-1a, ML- 1,
and OCI-AML3) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL; RCH-ACV, REH, and RS4;11) cell lines. We used
tagged versions of the CD33 proteins to distinguish those
from endogenously expressed CD33 in some of these cell
lines and to be able to track the CD33∆E2 and CD33∆E2,E7a
variants. While previous studies suggested that one CD33
antibody (clone Him3-4) specifically recognizes the
C2- set Ig-like domain and could be used to detect CD33
variants that lack exon 2 [9], in our experiments Him3- 4
only recognized CD33FL and CD33E7a but not CD33∆E2
or CD33∆E2,E7a when expressed in virally-transduced
ALL cell lines that are devoid of endogenous CD33
(Jurkat, RCH-ACV, REH, or RS4;11: Figure 3) and only
recognized CD33FL but not CD33∆E2 when expressed in

Internalization of CD33 splice variants in human
leukemia cell lines
As the first characteristic, we studied the endocytic
properties of the CD33 splice variants when engaged by
bivalent antibodies. To test whether the internalization
of antibody-bound CD33 differed depending on the type
of antibody used (i.e. His antibody vs. CD33 antibody),
we compared the 120- and 240-minute internalization of
CD33 in RCH-ACV and REH engineered to expressed
untagged and His-tagged CD33FL. The studies showed
very comparable rates of antibody uptake when studied
with CD33 antibody in cells expressing untagged and Histagged CD33FL or with His antibody in cells expressing
His-tagged CD33FL, indicating that the His-tag does not
interfere with the natural internalization properties of
CD33 (Figure 6). Overall, our experiments in the panel

of sublines of AML and ALL cells expressing Histagged CD33 spice variants demonstrated that each
variant is internalized when bound by a bivalent His
antibody (Figure 5). While, on average, the internalization
properties of each variant appeared relatively similar,
we noted some cell line-specific differences in the
comparative uptake of individual CD33 splice variants.
In particular, in ML-1 cells, internalization of the
CD33E7a variant proceeded more slowly than that of the
other CD33 molecules. Since some previous data have
suggested that CD33 might form dimers on the cell
surface in its physiologic state [16], we considered the
possibility that CD33∆E2 could interfere with the functional

properties of CD33FL. To test this idea, we compared the
internalization of endogenous CD33 when bound with
CD33 antibody in ML-1, OCI-AML3, and TF-1 cells
that were lentivirally-transduced to also express CD33∆E2
with that of non-transduced parental cells. These studies
showed that uptake of endogenous CD33 was unaffected
by the forced expression of the CD33∆E2 splice variant
(Figure 7). Finally, we also assessed the degree to which
cell surface CD33 expression levels decreased with
continued exposure to antibody (“CD33 modulation”).
In 24-hour assays, we found some differences between
individual CD33 variants in several acute leukemia
cell lines; however, while highly reproducible, these

differences were not consistent across cell lines but,
rather, appeared cell context specific. Specifically, in
engineered AML cell lines, a reduced degree of antigen
modulation relative to wild-type CD33 was noted in
sublines expressing CD33 isoforms containing exon 7a;
by comparison, in engineered ALL cell lines, a reduced
degree of antigen modulation relative to wild-type CD33
was noted in sublines expressing CD33 isoforms that lack
exon 2 (Figure 8).

(CD33FL and CD33E7a) sensitized human AML and ALL
cell lines to GO-induced cytotoxicity. Consistent with our
previous data [13], overexpression of CD33FL increased
GO-induced cytotoxicity in AML cell lines (KG-1a,
ML-1, and OCI-AML3) that endogenously express
CD33. In contrast, expression of CD33 variants that do
not contain the V-set domain (CD33∆E2 and CD33∆E2,E7a)
did not modulate the cytotoxic effects of GO. Moreover,
co-expression of CD33∆E2 did not impact GO-induced
cytotoxicity in AML cells endogenously displaying CD33
on the cell surface, as evidenced by our findings in ML-1
and OCI-AML3 cells, indicating that CD33∆E2 does not
interfere with the ability of CD33FL to serve as carrier
for intracellular delivery of cytotoxic drugs to CD33expressing leukemia cells.

antibody (AMG 330), and chimeric antigen receptormodified T-cells have recently entered the clinical
phase of drug testing, and others are at various stages of
preclinical development.
Because of this ongoing interest in CD33 as
an AML target, we sought to better characterize the
expression pattern of various forms of CD33 in human
AML. Using a large set of diagnostic specimens from
patients with AML, our studies demonstrate that in
the vast majority of cases, 3 splice variants of CD33
are found in addition to CD33FL. One of these variants
(CD33∆E2) has previously been found in normal myeloid
cells, microglial cells, T-lymphocytes, and natural
killer (NK) cells [8–11, 18], and has been implicated
in influencing the susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease
[10, 11, 18]. CD33∆E2 has also been described in several
human AML cell lines [9]. We extend these findings
by demonstrating that CD33∆E2 is present at the mRNA
level in the vast majority of primary AML specimens
(29 of 29 in our series). Our studies also show the
almost universal presence of mRNA corresponding to
a CD33E7a splice variant (the sequence of which was
previously deposited in the genome databases; found in
29 of 29 in our series) and a CD33∆E2,E7a splice variant
(found in 27 of 29 in our series), which has so far not
been described.
Exon 2 encodes the ligand-binding extracellular
V-set domain of CD33, and CD33 proteins lacking this
exon are expected to feature functional properties that
differ from those of wild-type CD33. Indeed, previous
studies have indicated that CD33FL but not CD33∆E2

DISCUSSION
The number of antigens exploited for
immunotherapy of AML has been increasing rapidly
over the last several years [17]. Nonetheless, CD33
remains of great interest for the development of
antibody-based therapies. Besides its broad expression
in AML, this interest is at least partially due to two
circumstances, namely the fact that it thus far represents
the only validated target in AML and the fact that GO
– the antibody-drug conjugate that provided target
validation – is currently not commercially available in
most countries [1]. Several new CD33-directed agents,
including a second-generation antibody-drug conjugate
(SGN- CD33A), a bispecific T-cell engaging (BiTE)

inhibits uptake and clearance of insoluble, toxic amyloid
b species by microglial cells in vitro – an activity that
may be important for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s
disease [19]. These studies have identified CD33 as a
potential target for the treatment and/or prevention of
Alzheimer’s disease [19]. In this situation, blocking
CD33 isoforms that contain exon 2 and have functional
activity may be sufficient. For the treatment of CD33+
malignancies, however, directing the therapeutic toward
all CD33 isoforms displayed on the cell surface may
be advantageous since it would provide the greatest
possible abundance of antibody binding sites. Consistent
with previous reports [9, 19], we found that CD33
variants lacking exon 2 can be expressed on the cell
surface, although our studies indicate that the efficiency
with which this happens varies between different cell
line backgrounds. Similar to wild-type CD33, our
experiments in engineered acute leukemia cell lines
document that the CD33∆E2 variant is internalized,
and could thus also serve as target for CD33-directed
therapeutics that depend on intracellular delivery of a
toxic payload.
Our studies in lentivirally-transduced acute
leukemia cell lines also show that the CD33 variants
that contain exon 7a, and therefore lack almost the
entire cytoplasmic tail of CD33, are internalized. At
first glance, this is surprising since we previously found
CD33 endocytosis to be controlled by the intracellular
domain of CD33. Introduction of point mutations in this

domain, for example in the immunoreceptor tyrosinebased inhibitory motifs or clusters of lysine residues,
reduced internalization of antibody/CD33 complexes in
our earlier studies [13, 15]. Whether the cell membrane
localization is influenced by the presence of the
cytoplasmic tail of CD33, and whether the mechanistic
principles for the uptake process differ between wildtype CD33 and variants that contain exon 7a, is currently
unknown and will be subject of future investigations.
The cell context-specific differences we found with
regard to modulation of individual CD33 variants
would be consistent with such differences in membrane
localization and/or internalization mechanisms. Planned
studies will also aim to identify differences between
CD33 variants containing exon 7a with wild-type protein
with regard to suppression of myeloid cell function – we
hypothesize that such differences exist given the lack of
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs when
exon 7a is utilized.
In summary, our studies demonstrate the presence of
3 splice variants of CD33 that have endocytic properties
when bound by a bivalent antibody in almost all patients
with AML. These findings document a greater-thanpreviously thought complexity of CD33 expression in
human AML. Furthermore, they identify CD33 variants
that lack exon 2 and are not recognized by currently
explored CD33-directed therapeutics as potential, hitherto
unexploited, targets for immunotherapy with unconjugated
or conjugated CD33 antibodies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

entry site (IRES)/Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein
(EGFP) cassette has previously been described [13, 23].
Human cDNAs corresponding to CD33FL with an
N-terminal hexahistidine (His), and the CD33∆E2, CD33E7a,
and CD33∆E2,E7a variants with or without an N-terminal His
tag were generated in TOPO vectors via standard PCR
cloning procedures (see Table 3 for primer sequences),
verified by sequencing, and subsequently transferred into
the pRRLsin.cPPT.MSCV vector. Lentiviral particles were
prepared as described previously [13].

Transcriptome sequencing of primary AML
specimens
Sixty-eight patients with newly diagnosed AML
enrolled on 2 recent COG trials were selected for
retrospective whole transcriptome RNA sequencing
(RNAseq) because they lacked known high-risk
cytogenetic features but eventually relapsed [20]. Total
RNA from pre-treatment bone marrow or peripheral blood
specimens was used to generate a cDNA library, which
was purified and enriched by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) amplification and subjected to 50-cycle pairedend sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq as previously
described [20]. RNA sequencing reads were then aligned
to the human genome to identify splice junctions between
exons and identify new gene variants using TopHat
[21]. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review
boards (IRBs) of all participating institutions approved
the clinical protocol, while the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center (Fred Hutch) IRB and the COG Myeloid
Disease Biology Committee approved this research study.

Parental and engineered human cell lines
Human myeloid KG-1a cells (kindly provided by Dr.
Derek L. Stirewalt; Fred Hutch, Seattle, WA), OCI-AML3
cells (kindly provided by Dr. Soheil Meshinchi; Fred
Hutch), and ML-1 as well as TF-1 cells (kindly provided
by Dr. Irwin D. Bernstein; Fred Hutch) were maintained
as previously described [13, 24, 25]. Human lymphoid
RCH-ACV and REH cells (kindly provided by Dr. Jerald
P. Radich; Fred Hutch) were maintained in RPMI-1640
medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Thermo Scientific,
Logan, UT), and RS4;11 cells were maintained in MEM
Alpha (Life Technologies) with 10% FBS. Human
embryo kidney (HEK)293T cells (kindly provided by
Dr. Jonathan A. Cooper; Fred Hutch) were maintained
in DMEM medium (Life Technologies) with 10% FBS.
All cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma-free but
were not recently authenticated. Sublines of these cell
lines overexpressing individual tagged or untagged CD33
constructs were generated through transduction with the
appropriate pRRLsin.cPPT.MSCV lentiviral particles at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25. EGFP-positive cells
were isolated by flow cytometry and re-cultured for further
analysis.

PCR-based detection of CD33 splice variant
expression in primary AML specimens
Frozen aliquots of Ficoll-isolated mononuclear cells
from pretreatment specimens (bone marrow [n = 13],
peripheral blood [n = 14], or apheresis [n = 2]) from
29 adults with newly diagnosed (n  =  17) or relapsed/
refractory (n = 12) AML were obtained from Fred Hutch
AML cell repositories and selected for inclusion based on
the presence of a large number of myeloblasts (median:
87.4%; range: 38.6–95.1%; Table 1). We used the refined
United Kingdom Medical Research Council/National
Cancer Research Institute (MRC/NCRI) criteria to assign
cytogenetic risk [22]. Patients provided written informed
consent for the collection and use of their specimens
for research purposes under an IRB-approved protocol.
Genetic material was extracted using AllPrep DNA/
RNA Mini Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Approximately
25 ng of RNA was then reverse transcribed for each
PCR reaction with specific primers to amplify CD33FL,
CD33∆E2, CD33E7a, and CD33∆E2,E7a (see Table 2 for primer
sequences). Amplicons were electrophoretically separated
in 0.9% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide
(AlphaImager HP; ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA, USA).
Selected amplicons were subjected to Applied Biosystems
(ABI) BigDye™ Terminator sequencing.

Quantification of CD33 expression
Expression of untagged CD33 variants on
leukemia cell lines was quantified by flow cytometry
using an unconjugated CD33 antibody (clone P67.6; BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) [13, 23] or unconjugated
CD33 antibody followed by a biotin-anti-mouse secondary
antibody and APC-streptavidin (both BD Biosciences).
In some cases, a second CD33 antibody (clone HIM3-4)
previously reported to recognize the C2-set Ig-like domain
of CD33 [9] was used to detect cell surface display of
CD33 variants. Expression of hexahistidine-tagged CD33
proteins was determined using an antibody against THE™
His tag (clone 6G2A9; GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA)
followed by a biotin-anti-mouse secondary antibody and
APC-streptavidin. To identify nonviable cells, samples
were stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
10,000 events were acquired on a BD FACSCanto II flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences), and DAPI- cells analyzed
using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).

Quantification of CD33 internalization and
modulation

then incubated with His antibody (to saturate binding
sites) or no antibody followed by biotin-conjugated rat
anti-mouse IgG1 (used at 2.5 µg/mL in PBS/2% FBS) and
streptavidin-APC (used at 2.5 µg/mL in PBS/2% FBS). For
analysis, all samples were stained with DAPI to identify
nonviable cells; at least 10,000 events were acquired, and
DAPI- cells were analyzed on a BD FACSCanto II flow
cytometer using FlowJo. Linear fluorescence values were
used to calculate the percentage of CD33 internalization
or modulation.

To measure internalization of antibody-bound
CD33, cells (typically 1–1.5 × 106) were transferred into
15 mL polypropylene conical bottom tubes (Falcon™,
Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) and
incubated for at least 20 minutes with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS, GIBCO by Life Technologies)/2% FBS
containing 2.5 µg/ mL unconjugated P67.6 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) or His tag antibody in
ice-water (to prevent internalization during the staining
procedure), as appropriate. Cells were then washed in
ice-cold PBS, resuspended in IMDM medium without
antibody, split into several tubes, and incubated at 37°C (in
5% CO2 and air) for various periods of time. Afterwards,
cells were chilled and incubated with biotin-conjugated
rat anti-mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody (used at
2.5  µg/mL in PBS/2% FBS), followed by incubation
with streptavidin-APC conjugate (used at 2.5 µg/mL in
PBS/2% FBS: both from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) to detect remaining primary antibody on the cell
surface. One sample that was kept in ice water was used
to determine the starting level of antibody bound to the
cell surface. To determine CD33 modulation, aliquots of
engineered leukemia cells were left untreated or incubated
with unlabeled His tag antibody (used at 2.5 µg/mL). After
24 hours, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS to remove
unbound antibody and resuspended in PBS/2%FBS.

Quantification of drug-induced cytotoxicity
AML cells were incubated at 37°C (in 5% CO2 and
air) in 96-well round bottom plates (Falcon™) at 8 × 103
cells/well in 200 µL culture medium containing various
concentrations of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (commercially
obtained from Pfizer, New York, NY). After 72 hours, cell
numbers and drug-induced cytotoxicity, using DAPI to detect
non-viable cells, were determined using a BDFACSCanto II
flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software.
