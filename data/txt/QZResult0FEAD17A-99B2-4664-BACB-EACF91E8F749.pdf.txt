BACKGROUND: To determine the safety and maximum-tolerated dose of concurrent sunitinib and imageguided radiotherapy (IGRT) followed by maintenance sunitinib in oligometastastic patients. METHODS: Eligible patients had 1 to 5 sites of metastatic cancer measuring 6 cm. The most common treatment sites
were bone, liver, and lung. Patients were treated with concurrent sunitinib (Day 1 through Day 28) and
IGRT (40-50 Gy in 10 fractions starting on Day 8) followed by maintenance sunitinib (50 mg daily, 4 weeks
on/2 weeks off starting on Day 43). The starting dose was sunitinib 25 mg and IGRT 40 Gy. Doses were
escalated in a ping-pong design with incremental increases in either sunitinib or IGRT. RESULTS: Twentyone patients with 36 metastatic lesions were enrolled, with a median follow-up of 10 months. No dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were noted at dose levels 1 or 2 (SU 37.5 mg/RT 40 Gy). One of 10 patients at dose
level 3 (SU 37.5 mg/RT 50 Gy) and 2 of 5 patients at dose level 4 (SU 50 mg/RT 50 Gy) experienced DLTs
comprising grade 4 myelosuppression and grade 3 nausea. At last follow-up, 8 patients are alive without
evidence of progression. The 1-year local, progression-free, and overall survival were 85%, 44%, and 75%,
respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of SU (25 to 37.5 mg) to IGRT is tolerable in patients with oligometastases, without potentiation of RT toxicity. On the basis of promising antitumor responses observed with
this novel combination, a multi-institutional phase 2 trial using SU 37.5 mg/RT 50 Gy is ongoing. Cancer

patients with metastatic cancer die to their disease. Surgery and chemotherapy have resulted in long-term, disease-free survival in approximately 25% of patients
with colorectal cancer and isolated liver metastases.3 In
addition, some patients with isolated pulmonary metastases, most notably soft tissue sarcoma, are rendered
disease-free with resection and chemotherapy.4 Supported by these observations, the presence of oligometastases has been proposed by Hellman.5 Although
some tumors have spread widely before clinical detectability and others never metastasize, for the majority of
cancers, metastatic capacity evolves during the clinical
phase of tumor growth. During this evolutionary process, there may be an oligometastatic state when metastases are limited in number and location because
metastatic capacity has not fully evolved.5 If this hypothesis is valid, then these patients would benefit from effective local therapy in addition to systemic therapy. Recent
advances in cytotoxic chemotherapy and biological therapy have resulted in improved overall survival and disease-free survival for the most common metastatic
cancers including breast, prostate, colorectal and lung
cancer.6-12 However, there is no evidence that chemotherapy or biological therapy alone results in an appreciable long-term cure rate. The median progression-free
survival for the 4 most common metastatic tumor types
(lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal) with chemotherapy alone ranges from 2 to 11 months, depending on primary tumor site and degree of pretreatment.6-12 In a
recent pattern of failure analysis, 38 patients with metastatic lung cancer treated on a phase 2 trial of oxaliplatin
and paclitaxel were carefully analyzed. Fifty percent of
patients presented with 3 metastatic sites and 50% had
stable disease or progressed only within initially involved
sites on follow-up, suggesting a potential benefit for local
therapy could exist in selected patients.13
Although conventional chemotherapy has been limited by low therapeutic index, poor drug penetration
through tissue and multidrug resistance, targeted therapies are hindered by genetic heterogeneity within tumors
and the multiple genetic abnormalities associated with
solid tumors.14-16 Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib, are a promising approach toward
overcoming some of these barriers to cure. Angiogenesis

inhibitors, including sunitinib, have been shown to significantly enhance radiation response by selectively targeting
tumor vasculature in preclinical studies.17-18 With advances in radiation planning and tumor imaging, it is now
possible to safely target sites of gross metastatic disease
with high dose, image-guided radiation therapy.19-20 We
hypothesize that combining effective local therapy to gross
disease with effective biological therapy for micrometastatic disease represents a potentially curative approach.
Recent data from University of Rochester suggests that
stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy to a dose of 40
to 50 Gy in 10 fractions is well tolerated and renders
approximately 20% of patients with 1 to 5 distant metastases free of disease at 4 years.21 With the ultimate goal of
improving upon the local (60%) and distant (25%) control of radiation alone, we embarked on a phase 1 trial
investigating a novel treatment combination of sunitinib
and image-guided radiotherapy.21

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients were eligible if they had histologically or cytologically documented advanced solid tumor malignancy with
radiographic evidence of 1 to 5 sites of active metastatic
disease on whole body imaging (Positron emission tomography [PET] or computed tomography [CT] chest,
abdomen, pelvis and bone scan) measuring 6 cm in
maximum dimension. Other key eligibility criteria
included age 18 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, and
adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.
Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function was
defined as hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dl, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1500/mL, platelet
count greater than 100,000/mL, serum creatinine and bilirubin within institutional limits, serum albumin greater
than 2.9 g/dl, serum alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5
times the upper limit of normal, and serum AST and ALT
less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. Eligibility
required prior chemotherapy or radiation to be discontinued for at least 2 weeks before study entry. Three patients
received chemotherapy within 3 months of starting radiation and all had evidence of progression before starting
sunitinib. Patients were excluded if they had uncontrolled

brain metastases, malignant pleural or pericardial effusion,
life expectancy <3 months, prior radiation to volume
encompassed by planning target volume (PTV), or uncontrolled intercurrent illness defined as ongoing active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Between February 2007 and May 2008, 21 patients
who received informed consent were enrolled on the study.
The study was reviewed by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Institutional Review Board, which was conducted in
accordance to federal and institutional guidelines.
Drug Administration
Sunitinib was administered orally once daily in 6-week
cycles comprising 4 weeks of treatment followed by 2
weeks without treatment. Pfizer, the sponsor of the trial,
provided sunitinib. Patients were monitored weekly during treatment for toxicity and premedication was not routinely prescribed with the exception of 5-HT3 inhibitors
for patients receiving gastric radiation. If unexpected
grade 3 toxicity occurred, sunitinib was temporarily discontinued but restarted at the next lower dose level when
the toxicity has resolved to grade 2 or lower. For patients
with persistent dose-modifying toxicities despite dose
reduction, sunitinib was discontinued and radiation was
continued at the discretion of the treating physician. After
completion of the first treatment cycle, the treating medical oncologist had the option of continuing on maintenance sunitinib for additional cycles if there was no
unacceptable toxicity or progression for up to 2 years.
Radiation Guidelines
Radiation was administered concurrently with the first
cycle of sunitinib during Day 8 to Day 19. Each patient’s
treatment was individualized with respect to immobilization and radiation planning technique to optimally cover
the target volume, adequately account for organ motion,
and meet strict normal tissue dose and volume limits.
Briefly, all patients underwent CT simulation before the
first treatment using appropriate site-specific immobilization. For sites with significant respiratory motion, maximum inspiratory, expiratory, and free-breathing CT scans
were fused to document the maximum amplitude of tumor
motion. Relaxed end expiratory breath holding, forced

shallow breathing and/or external optical tracking was used
to ensure minimal internal organ motion during radiotherapy. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as gross
tumor on CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and/or
PET. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as
GTV with 0-5 mm margin. PTV was defined as CTV with
adequate margin for internal tumor motion and setup
uncertainty, generally between 3 mm and 10 mm. We prescribed to the isodose line covering 95% of the PTV that
was not immediately adjacent to a critical structure.
Patients were treated on either a Novalis Tx radiosurgery system (n ¼ 15) or Varian linear accelerator with
on-board portal imaging capability (n ¼ 6). Depending
on treatment site, treatment planning comrpised conformal arcs, intensity modulated radiation, or 3-dimensional
forward planning using Novalis Brainscan (version 5.3)
and Varian Eclipse (version 8.0) planning systems. Intensity modulation was not used for targets shown to have
1cm organ motion. Pencil beam algorithm is used for
both planning systems and the percentage depth dose/tissue maximum ratio (PDD/TMR) curves are fitted reasonably well with measured data in the buildup region. All the
lesions we treated in this study locate beyond the buildup
region and phantom measurements show 1% deviation
between measured and modeled PDD/TMR. Daily kilovoltage or megavoltage image guidance was mandatory
using either implanted fiducial markers into tissue immediately adjacent to the tumor or fusion of the bony anatomy
in the vicinity of the tumor. The attending physician was
present for verification of the first treatment. Subsequent
treatments were administered in accordance with a standardized protocol defining thresholds for either performing
calculated shifts or calling the attending physician and
physicist. The attending physician regularly reviewed all
shifts and portal images. Strict normal tissue dose and volume limits based on available published data were used to
ensure patient safety (Table 1).22
Dose Escalation Procedure
Sunitinib and radiation doses were sequentially escalated
using a ping-pong strategy according to a 3 þ 3 design
phase 1 study (Table 2). Toxicity was evaluated weekly
during treatment. During follow-up, toxicity was evaluated 1 month after completing RT and every 3 months
subsequently for 2 years. If 0 of 3 patients had dose limiting toxicities (DLT), subsequently enrolled patients were

treated at the next radiotherapy or sunitinib dose level (see
Table 3). If 2 of 3 patients have DLTs, dose escalation
was terminated and the next lowest dose level was declared
the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for phase 2 evaluation. If 1 of 3 patients had a DLT, then 3 more patients
were treated at the same dose level, and if the incidence of
DLT among 6 patients is <2 of 6, then the dose was escalated to the next level. Acute and available late toxicities
were included in consideration of dose escalation. After
the MTD was identified, an expanded cohort totaling 10
patients was treated at that dose level to confirm safety.
Toxicity was in assessed in patients at regular intervals by using the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events criteria (version 3.0). Dose limiting events
were defined as any grade 4 or 5 toxicity and unexpected
grade 3 toxicity. Expected grade 3 toxicities from radiation include mucositis or esophagitis lasting 7 days.
Grade 3 metabolic and hematologic toxicities are considered expected events with sunitinib and therefore were not
considered DLTs.23

Follow-up
Follow-up visits, including complete history and physical
examination, were planned 1 month after completing RT
and every 3 months subsequently for 2 years. Patients
underwent diagnostic imaging studies before all follow-up
visits after the initial 1-month visit. During follow-up, the
following diagnostic imaging studies were required: CT
scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis or whole body 18FDG PET/CT. Other imaging, including bone scan,
plain x-ray, or MRI, could be ordered as clinically indicated. Tumor response for each metastatic lesion and
patient was assessed using Response Evaluation and Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) of the most recent imaging
study. The RECIST definition of complete response was
modified to include disappearance of the target tumor
radiographically or metabolically (standardized uptake
value ¼ 0 when the pretreatment PET was metabolically
active).24 Local in-field recurrence was defined as progression or recurrence within the high-dose region (> 80%
isodose volume). Actuarial overall and progression-free
survival rates were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier
method. Patients considered to have disease-free survival
had either a partial response or a complete response locally
without distant progression.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics for the 21 patients and 36 metastatic lesions are shown in Table 4. The median tumor
size was 3.2 cm (range 0.9 to 6 cm).
Treatment Compliance
Ninety-7 percent of the prescribed radiotherapy was delivered and 5 patients had treatment delays for flu-like sympCancer

toms (n ¼ 2), myelosuppression (n ¼ 2) and patient
noncompliance (n ¼ 1). Compliance with concurrent
sunitinib was excellent in dose levels 1, 2, and 3. At dose
level 4, all 5 patients required either a dose reduction,
drug holiday, or treatment discontinuation due to acute
toxicity. Ten patients continued on maintenance sunitinib. Reasons for not receiving sunitinib include patient refusal (n ¼ 4), receiving alternative systemic therapy (n ¼
2), toxicity (n ¼ 2), early progression (n ¼ 2), and patient
noncompliance (n ¼ 1).

There were no dose limiting events in dose levels 1, 2, or 3
during the dose escalation phase. Among 5 patients
treated on dose level 4, there were 3 DLTs in 2 patients,
which comprised transient grade 4 thrombocytopenia,
transient grade 4 lymphopenia, and grade 3 nausea lasting
7 days. During the expanded cohort of dose level 3,
there were 3 dose limiting toxicities occurring in 1 patient,
which comprised transient grade 4 anemia, lymphopenia,
and thrombocytopenia. In aggregate, 1 of 10 patients
treated on dose level 3 experienced a DLT. The 3 patients
experiencing DLTs were all treated on dose level 3 or 4,
received prior chemotherapy, and required large volume
liver radiation with concurrent sunitinib. In 2 of these
cases, DLTs resulted in premature discontinuation of
radiation.
Other grade 3 adverse events included 9 patients
with grade 3 lymphopenia, 4 patients with grade 3 neutropenia, 2 patients with grade 3 elevated GGT, 1 patient
with grade 3 elevated bilirubin, 2 patients with hypophosphatemia, and 1 patient with grade 3 thrombocytopenia.
One patient with hepatitis C experienced hemorrhoidal
bleeding during therapy. The patient received liver radiation, which may have affected sunitinib metabolism and
exacerbated her baseline rectal bleeding from liver dysfunction. Although not attributed to protocol therapy, 1
patient, who received radiation therapy to the L4 vertebral
body and was previously treated with 2 courses of head
and neck radiotherapy (cumulative dose of 100 Gy) outside the context of protocol therapy, subsequently developed grade 5 tracheal necrosis. There are no significant
late radiation toxicities occurring 6 months after therapy
among the 13 patients with adequate follow-up (see
Table 4).

irradiated sites with no evidence of new lesions on imaging were achieved in 9 patients (43%). At a median follow-up of 10 months for surviving patients (range 2.4 to
17.8 months), 8 (38%) patients are alive without evidence
of disease. Nine patients had isolated distant failures
(43%), 3 patients had both local and distant failures
(14%), and 1 patient with no evidence of progression died
of comorbid illness (5%). Thirteen patients have experienced disease progression at a median of 58 days (range 2
to 386 days). Patterns of failure analysis reveals 5 patients
that failed elsewhere in the irradiated organ only, 2
patients who failed only in an unirradiated organ, 5
patients that failed in both irradiated and unirradiated
organs, and 1 comorbid death. Among treatment failures,
3 patients had isolated recurrences that were amenable to
additional local therapy.
The 1-year actuarial local control, progression-free
survival, and overall survival were 85%, 44%, and 75%,
respectively (Fig. 1). Examples of unexpected complete
responses in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

Radiation therapy for metastatic disease is given primarily
with the goal of palliation.19 Therefore, low dose-intensity
radiation is used to avoid treatment-related complications
with standard low-precision large field radiation. However, when radiation is used to eradicate gross disease,
higher doses are needed. There is now an expanding experience with image-guided extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy as effective local therapy for metastatic lesions.
This technique requires secure patient immobilization,
accurate patient repositioning, accounting for internal
organ motion, use of highly conformal dose distributions,
registration of patient anatomy to fiducial markers, and
use of dose intense fractionation schemes.25 Local control
ranging from 60 to 90% has been reported for metastatic
tumors of the spine, lung and liver, which is significantly
higher than standard palliative radiation.20,21,24 Toxicity
has been acceptable in multiple US, European, and
Japanese trials of extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy to
carefully selected lung, liver, spine, pelvic, and abdominal
tumors despite the use very high biological equivalent
doses.20,24,26,27 With this approach, long-term data

with a CA19-9 of 16 compared with a maximum value of 636 and no evidence of disease on PET/CT.

suggesting durable remissions have been reported.21,24
However, because systemic failures predominate, it is logical to integrate systemic therapy with this new
approach.21,24 Although many practitioners of stereotactic body radiotherapy are using 1 to 5 fractions with daily
fraction sizes exceeding 10 Gy, the hypofractionated radiation regimen of 40 to 50 Gy in 10 fractions described by
Uematsu in 2001 and extensively tested as treatment for
oligometastases at University of Rochester remains an
effective and well tolerated regimen.21 With the goal of
safely incorporating radiosensitizing systemic therapy for
a variety of treatment sites, we elected to use the 10 fraction regimen.

Sunitinib (SU11248) is a small molecule receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets multiple pathways
including PDGFRa, c-kit, VEGFR1, VEGFR2,
VEGFR3, FLT3, and RET. These receptor tyrosine
kinases are implicated in tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Overall, sunitinib has a favorable toxicity profile with adverse events that have been manageable
and generally reversible. Sunitinib significantly prolonged
time to progression (27 vs 6 weeks, P < .001) and
improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] .49, P ¼

treated with salvage surgery. He was noted on follow-up PET/CT to have a solitary enlarged subcarinal lymph node measuring

dose to 40 Gy with IMRT planning, particularly in the region of tumor bulk where no esophageal lumen could be identified. (b) To
optimize therapeutic ratio of a tumor immediately adjacent to a critical structure, a simultaneous integrated boost IMRT plan was
generated to deliver 4 Gy to the entire target volume while administering 5 Gy to the portion of the tumor that does not abut
the esophagus. The maximum esophagus dose is limited to 4 Gy. He tolerated treatment well save for transient cough, grade 3
lymphopenia, and fatigue. (c) Posttreatment CT at 3 months after radiation demonstrated complete resolution of the large subcarinal mass and interval resolution of the subcarinal mass.

1 and 2 studies documenting activity as a single agent in
several types of advanced cancers.29,30 Recently, sunitinib

To the author’s knowledge, this is the first report
demonstrating the safety and efficacy of concurrent sunitinib and radiotherapy. Sunitinib can be safely integrated
into dose-intense protocols of image-guided radiotherapy
at doses up to 37.5 mg. In contrast to a larger published

experience with bevacizumab and radiotherapy, which
suggests an increase in necrosis and fistula formation,
there is no evidence of potentiation of radiation toxicity
in this study. Conversely, concurrent radiotherapy
appears to limit the tolerability of full dose sunitinib.
Five dose-limiting toxicities occurred in 3 heavily pretreated patients who received liver radiotherapy. Grade
4 thrombocytopenia, grade 4 lymphopenia, grade 4 anemia, and protracted grade 3 nausea are uncommon with
full dose sunitinib alone. Taking into account volume of
bone marrow irradiated, combined sunitinib appears to
decrease white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils, and
monocytes compared with radiation alone (unpublished
data). Although the specific mechanism for these physiological changes is not currently known, large volume
liver irradiation may decrease metabolism of sunitinib.
Therefore, the recommended phase 2 dose of sunitinib
with concurrent radiotherapy is 37.5 mg. Patients with
liver PTVs measuring >6 cm will be ineligible for a
phase 2 trial. This study provides proof of principle that
patients with oligometastases may an appropriate population to study the interaction between radiation and
promising biological therapies, particularly agents with
efficacy across various histologies.
Although not the primary endpoint, this trial provides evidence of significant clinical activity of combined sunitinib and radiotherapy. At the very least, the
response rates seem favorable compared with systemic
therapy alone, even when factoring in progression outside of the high dose radiation field. Durable complete
responses were noted in historically treatment refractory histologies including pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
malignant melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting
possible clinical benefit. Furthermore, this regimen
resulted in complete responses in patients with prostate
adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma and
local complete responses in leiomyosarcoma, nonsmall
cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. These major
responses in a variety of histologies lend support to
continuing this study as a multi-institutional phase 2
trial.
