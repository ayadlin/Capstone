Abstract
The goal of this study was to characterize a series of antiHer2/neu immunotoxin constructs to identify how different
antibodies and linker choices affect the specificity and cytotoxicity of these proteins. We constructed a series of immunotoxins containing either the human single-chain antibody
(scFv) C6.5 or the murine scFv e23 fused to the highly toxic
recombinant gelonin (rGel) molecule. Based on the flexible
GGGGS linker (L), the fusion construct C6.5-L-rGel was compared with e23-L-rGel to evaluate the specific cytotoxic effects
against Her2/neu-positive and Her2/neu-negative tumor cells.
Both constructs retained the specificity of the original antibody as well as the biological activity of rGel toxin. The two
constructs displayed similar cytotoxicity against different carcinoma cells. We additionally introduced the modified linkers
TRHRQPRGWEQL (Fpe) and AGNRVRRSVG (Fdt), which
contained furin cleavage sites, to determine the effect of these
design changes on stability and cell killing efficiency. The introduction of furin cleavage linkers (Fpe or Fdt) into the molecules resulted in dissimilar sensitivity to protease cleavage
compared with the constructs containing the L linker, but
very similar intracellular rGel release, cytotoxic kinetics,
and induction of autophagic cell death in vitro. Xenograft
studies with SKOV3 ovarian tumors were done using various
C6.5/rGel constructs. C6.5-L-rGel was more efficient in tumor
inhibition than constructs containing furin linkers, attributing to a higher stability in vivo of the L version. Therefore,
our studies suggest that human C6.5-L-rGel may be an effective novel clinical agent for therapy of patients with Her2/neuoverexpressing malignancies. [Cancer Res 2009;69(23):8987–95]

Introduction
The Her2/neu proto-oncogene encodes a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein kinase with extensive homology to the epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1; refs. 1–3). Amplification of
the gene and overexpression of the Her2/neu protein product in
tumor cells have been well described in numerous human cancers,

including mammary and ovarian carcinomas and gastric and lung
tumors (4–6). Because Her2/neu plays a central role in malignant
transformation and growth, it provides an attractive target for
focused therapeutic approaches.
A number of approved immunotherapeutic agents are directed
at tumors that express high levels of Her2/neu, such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), and small-molecule inhibitors such as gefitinib (Iressa) have shown promising results, but
the development of resistance to treatment remains a well-known
problem (7, 8). To enhance its clinical potential, cell-surface Her2/
neu has been targeted using antibody-drug conjugates (9) or immunotoxins, composed of plant or bacterial toxins linked with a
targeting molecule composed of monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments (10, 11). Previously, a recombinant, murine antiHer2/neu single-chain antibody (scFv), designated e23, has been
fused to catalytic toxins such as Pseudomonas exotoxin A and diphtheria toxin (DT) to specifically target Her2/neu-expressing cells
(12, 13). A major drawback of such proteins is their potential for
immune response after repeated administration. Further complications could result from nonspecific binding of foreign proteins to
vascular endothelial cells, leading to vascular leak syndrome and,
ultimately, interstitial edema and organ failure (14, 15).
The development of immunotoxins containing human or humanized components may circumvent these problems. Such immunotoxins may display reduced immunogenicity although
antibodies to the toxin components may still limit prolonged therapy (16). We previously reported in vitro characterization and
in vivo antitumor efficacy studies of an immunotoxin composed
of the human chimeric anti-Her2/neu antibody (BACH-250) chemically conjugated to recombinant gelonin (rGel; ref. 17). rGel is a
29-kDa ribosome-inactivating plant toxin with a potency and
mechanism of action similar to that of ricin toxin A-chain, but with
improved stability and reduced toxicity (18, 19). The BACH-250/
rGel conjugate showed potent and specific cytotoxicity against
Her2/neu-overexpressing human tumor cells in culture and against
SKOV3 tumor xenografts. However, the treatment of solid tumors
presents a potential problem because full-length antibodies must
diffuse into the tumor against a hydrostatic pressure gradient and
into disordered vasculature (20, 21).
Marks and colleagues previously described an anti-Her2/neu
scFv, designated C6.5, which was selected from a human scFv
phage display library and affinity-matured in vitro (22). Using scFv
C6.5, McCall and colleagues constructed and characterized a bispecific scFv composed of C6.5 and anti-CD16 scFv, displaying a
high level of in vitro tumor cell cytotoxicity and in vivo tumor targeting (23). Studies by Park and colleagues generated immunoliposomes containing doxorubicin, which were targeted to tumor cells

using antibody C6.5. These constructs showed selective enhancement of the therapeutic index of doxorubicin chemotherapy (24).
Most recently, Adams and colleagues successfully used a C6.5 diabody construct as a radioimmunotherapeutic agent containing
(211At) for the treatment of Her2/neu-positive solid tumors in xenograft models, showing that scFv C6.5 could be used effectively in
vehicles for targeted radioimmunotherapy by using powerful,
short-lived α-emitting radioisotopes (25).
In the present study, we describe the construction and characterization of several rGel-based chimeric toxins composed of the
scFv e23 or C6.5 and using various linker configurations to examine how different antibodies and linker choices affect the in vitro
and in vivo efficacy of fusion constructs.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid construction. The gene encoding murine scFv e23 was obtained from Oncologix, Inc., and human scFv C6.5 was kindly supplied by
Prof. James D. Marks (University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco,
CA). Illustrations of the immunotoxin constructs are shown in Fig. 1A.
Recombinant immunotoxins containing rGel and either e23 or C6.5 and
the flexible linker (GGGGS, designated “L”) were constructed by overlapping
PCR. These proteins were designated e23-L-rGel and C6.5-L-rGel, respectively. In addition, we generated two different linkers (TRHRQPRGWEQL,
designated “Fpe,” and AGNRVRRSVG, designated “Fdt”) containing furin
cleavage sites from Pseudomonas exotoxin A and DT, incorporated between
the C6.5 and rGel components. The intent was that furin cleavage would
allow more facile release of the toxin from the complex once internalized
by the endosomal compartment. The resulting proteins were designated
C6.5-Fpe-rGel and C6.5-Fdt-rGel, respectively. All the fusion genes were
cloned into a T7 promoter–based E. coli expression vector, pET-32a(+).
Protein expression in E. coli. To express the recombinant fusion proteins, bacterial cultures were incubated at 37°C in LB growth medium with
strong antibiotic selection (400 μg/mL ampicillin, 70 μg/mL chloramphenicol, and 15 μg/mL kanamycin) and grown to log phase (A600 nm = 0.8). The
target protein expression was induced at 18°C with 0.1 mmol/L isopropyl-Lthio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 16 h. Induced bacterial cultures were then
centrifuged and stored frozen at −80°C.
Isolation and purification of immunotoxins. Frozen bacterial pellets
containing different immunotoxins were purified as follows: The pellets
were allowed to thaw with the addition of 50 mmol/L Na-phosphate (pH
7.6), 300 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L imidazole. The bacterial suspension was
further lysed by passing the material through a microfludizer (Microfluidics). The solution was then clarified by centrifugation (40,000 rpm), and
the supernatants were loaded onto columns (2.5-cm internal diameter × 13
cm) containing cobalt-charged IMAC resins. After washing with 50 mmol/L
Na-phosphate (pH 7.6), 300 mmol/L NaCl, 15 mmol/L imidazole, the bound
protein was eluted with 50 mmol/L Na-phosphate (pH 7.6), 300 mmol/L
NaCl, 300 mmol/L imidazole. Fractions containing immunotoxin were
dialyzed in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mmol/L NaCl, followed
by digestion with recombinant enterokinase. The purified immunotoxins
were dialyzed in PBS, filter sterilized, and stored at 4°C.
Binding affinity and internalization analyses. The binding affinity
and specificity of rGel-based immunotoxins containing either scFv e23
or C6.5 were evaluated by ELISA on Her2/neu-positive SKOV3 cells and
Her2/neu-negative MCF7 cells. Rabbit anti-rGel antibody and horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as a tracer in this
assay as described previously (26).
Immunofluorescence-based internalization studies were also done on
SKOV3 and MCF7 cells (27). Cells treated with immunotoxins or rGel
were subjected to immunofluorescent staining with anti-rGel antibody
(FITC-conjugated secondary antibody). Nuclei were counterstained with
propidium iodine. Visualization of immunofluorescence was done with a
confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510, Carl Zeiss).

synthesizing system after the administration of various doses of immunotoxins was done as described previously (28).
Furin cleavage assay. Various C6.5/rGel fusions containing different
linkers were treated with recombinant human furin (NEB) at various pH.
For pH 5.4, 50 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer was used, and for pH 7.2, 10
mmol/L HEPES buffer was used. A dose of 2 units of purified furin was
applied to 25 μg of fusion protein in each reaction. After incubation for
16 h at room temperature, the proteins were analyzed by Western blot with
anti-rGel antibody. The rate of cleavage by furin was calculated using
AlphaEaseFC software (version 4.0.1) from the following formula: cleavage
rate = value of gray scale of cleaved protein / value of gray scale of total
protein.
In vitro cytotoxicity assays. Log-phase cells were seeded (∼5 × 103 per
well) in 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were further
incubated with various concentrations of immunotoxins, rGel, or medium
at 37°C for 72 h, and cell viability was determined by using the crystal violet
staining method followed by solubilization of the dye in Sorensor's buffer as
described previously (26).
Intracellular release of rGel. The intracellular rGel release from C6.5/
rGel fusion constructs was analyzed in SKOV3 cells. After incubation for
various times, the cells were treated with acidic glycine buffer [500
mmol/L NaCl and 0.1 mol/L glycine (pH 2.5)] to strip cell-surface–bound
proteins and lysed in lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mmol/L
KCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.2% NP40]. Cytosolic fractions were
further quantified and analyzed by Western blot using anti-rGel antibody.
Western blot analysis of apoptosis and autophagy. SKOV3 cells
treated with 200 nmol/L immunotoxins were pelleted and lysed. Proteins

Novel Immunotoxins Targeting Her2/neu
from each cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies
that recognized poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), β-actin, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP LC3; Novus Biological).
For HMGB1 release assay, the medium was harvested, concentrated,
and further analyzed by Western blot.
In vivo efficacy studies. BALB/c nude mice were injected s.c. with
SKOV3 cells (5 × 106 per mouse). Once tumors were measurable (∼40–50
mm3), animals were treated (i.v. via tail vein) with PBS or rGel as control or
with different C6.5/rGel fusion proteins, every other day for 10 d. Animals
were monitored and tumors were measured for an additional 40 d.
Immunofluorescence analysis. Twenty-four hours after i.v. injection of
C6.5-L-rGel or rGel, the mice were sacrificed and tumor samples were collected and frozen immediately for sectioning. The sample slides were fixed
in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton
X-100, and blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS. After incubation with antirGel antibody, the samples were subjected to immunofluorescent staining
with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody and nuclear counterstaining
with propidium iodine. The slides were mounted and delivered for the immunofluorescence observation under a Nikon Eclipse TS-100 fluorescence
microscope (Nikon).

the native rGel NH2 terminus. VH/VL orientations determined the
best binding activity of VL-VH for e23 and VH-VL for C6.5 (data not
shown). The C6.5/rGel construct was further engineered by incorporating two different enzymatically sensitive furin cleavage linkers between the scFv and rGel toxin components. The two furin
sensitive sequences are designated Fpe (TRHRQPRGWEQL) and
Fdt (AGNRVRRSVG; Fig. 1A). Several biochemical studies have
shown that the serine protease furin efficiently cleaves proteins
containing these recognition sequences (29, 30).
Following purification, all the rGel-based immunotoxins migrated on SDS-PAGE at the expected molecular weight of 55 kDa
(Fig. 1B). However, with the introduction of sensitive furin linker,
C6.5-Fdt-rGel, but not C6.5-Fpe-rGel, displayed cleavage bands to
some extent after rEK digestion. The cleavage was found to be occurring precisely at the predicted furin cleavage site producing the
27- to 28-kDa fragments of scFv and rGel. Further analysis indicated that the yields for each protein (per liter of bacterial culture)
were 1.55 mg for e23-L-rGel, 1.05 mg for C6.5-L-rGel, 1.08 mg for
C6.5-Fpe-rGel, and 0.70 mg for C6.5-Fdt-rGel.

SKOV3 and Her2/neu-negative MCF7 cells. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, was further calculated (GraphPad Prism,
v4.03). The affinity of e23-L-rGel (Kd = 8.5 nmol/L) for SKOV3 cells
was similar to that of C6.5-L-rGel (Kd = 12.6 nmol/L). The Kd values
were consistent with those previously measured in an in vitro live
cell assay using scFv itself (22). In addition, both immunotoxins
showed significant specificity based on the background of binding
to MCF7 cells. ELISA assay suggested that the human scFv C6.5 displayed similar binding specificity compared with the murine e23.
Cell-free protein synthesis inhibitory activity. The biological
activity of toxins can be severely compromised when incorporated
into fusion constructs. To examine the N-glycosidic activity of the
rGel component of the immunotoxins, these materials were added
to an in vitro protein translation assay using [3H]leucine incorporation by isolated rabbit reticulocytes. Inhibition curves for the fusion constructs e23-L-rGel and C6.5-L-rGel and native rGel were
compared (Fig. 2B), and IC50 values for the three molecules were
found to be virtually identical (15.41, 15.52, and 10.6 pmol/L, respectively), suggesting that no loss of toxin activity occurred in
the fusion molecules.
Cellular uptake of immunotoxins. We next examined whether
the e23-L-rGel and C6.5-L-rGel fusions could specifically internalize into target cells. Immunofluorescence staining was done on
SKOV3 and MCF7 cells after exposure to the constructs. As shown
in Fig. 2C, the rGel moiety of both fusions was observed primarily
in the cytosol of SKOV3 after treatment, but not in MCF7 cells,
showing that both constructs were comparable in efficient cell
binding and rapid internalization and delivery of rGel toxin to
the cytoplasm after exposure to Her2/neu-positive cells.
In vitro cytotoxicity. The e23-L-rGel and C6.5-L-rGel constructs
and rGel were tested against a number of different tumor cell lines
(Table 1). The SKBR3 cells with the highest level of Her2/neu expression were killed most efficiently by both antibody fusion constructs, with IC50 values of 6.0 and 9.1 nmol/L for e23-L-rGel and
C6.5-L-rGel, respectively. IC50 values for rGel toxin were ∼200-fold
higher (1,671 nmol/L). For the other Her2/neu-positive cells, both
immunotoxins also showed similar IC50 values, showing that the
two fusion proteins possess very similar cell killing activity and
specificity. Furthermore, MCF7 and 4T1 cells, which express relatively low levels of Her2/neu, showed little to no specific cytotoxicity of the fusion constructs compared with rGel itself, clearly
showing that the presence of higher levels of cell-surface Her2/
neu is required for specific cytotoxicity of the constructs.

In vitro cleavage of C6.5/rGel fusions by furin. From the
in vitro study, it was evident that no significant differences were
observed between murine e23– and human C6.5–based fusion constructs. Therefore, we focused on C6.5/rGel for further studies by
incorporation of proteolytically cleavable linkers (Fpe and Fdt) to
examine whether this change would improve killing efficiency. To
investigate the susceptibility of various chimeric toxins to proteolytic cleavage, purified fusions were subjected to proteolysis with
recombinant furin (Fig. 3A). At pH 7.2, cleavage of Fpe (18.5% of
total) and Fdt (100%) was observed. At pH 5.4, Fpe was cleaved less
efficiently (4.5% of total), but Fdt still displayed high cleavage efficiency (100%). In contrast, fusion with L linker was found to be
highly stable and could not be cleaved at either pH. As indicated,
the Fdt linker was the most sensitive to cleavage among all the constructs. In contrast, cleavage of the molecule containing the Fpe
linker was highly dependent on pH. The L linker was found to be
comparatively resistant to protease action without regard to the pH.
Kinetics of cytotoxicity by C6.5/rGel fusions. To investigate
the kinetics of cytotoxicity by different C6.5/rGel fusions, their cell
killing activities were assessed against SKBR3, SKOV3, Calu3, and
MDA MB435S cells at various time points (Supplementary
Table S1). Interestingly, the cell lines showed no differences in
overall sensitivity to the fusion constructs with furin cleavage linkers compared to those with flexible L linker. All the fusions
showed potent cytotoxicity after 48 hours and exerted highly potent cell killing at 72 hours. This suggests that the cleavage efficiency of different linkers for these chimeric toxins was not a major
determinant of the overall cytotoxic effects observed with different
linkers. Surprisingly, the cytotoxic kinetics of the constructs therefore seemed to be independent of the sensitivity of the constructs
to proteolytic cleavage.
Intracellular release of rGel from various constructs. The intracellular release of rGel after endocytosis of various C6.5/rGel fusion constructs was assessed by Western blot with an anti-rGel
antibody (Fig. 3B). During the treatment of SKOV3 cells, rGel release was found to be maximal at 2 hours after treatment with
C6.5-L-rGel and 4 hours after exposure to C6.5-Fpe-rGel. For
C6.5-Fdt-rGel, the rGel component was released within 1 to 2
hours and degraded simultaneously, corresponding to the status
of full-length protein. The decreasing intracellular level of fulllength C6.5-Fdt-rGel could be ascribed to rapid instability of the
construct after internalization. Although the maximal rGel release
of different fusions was achieved at different time points, the

Novel Immunotoxins Targeting Her2/neu

absolute amounts of delivered rGel found in the cytosol were virtually identical. Therefore, these data confirm the observation
that introduction of an unstable furin cleavage linker does not
improve the intracellular rGel release of the constructs.
Functional stability analysis of C6.5/rGel fusions. The linkers
between C6.5 and rGel showed a differential sensitivity to protease
action, which may result in different clearance and metabolic kinetics in vivo (31, 32). To estimate the stability of various C6.5/rGel
fusions, we incubated the purified proteins at 37°C for varying
times in the presence of human plasma before testing cellular
Her2/neu binding to SKOV3 cells (Fig. 3C). Our results showed that
in the presence of human plasma, the C6.5-Fdt-rGel construct displayed a reduction in binding activity within 6 hours of incubation
and a 20% loss of binding activity after 72 hours of incubation. In
contrast, the C6.5-L-rGel and C6.5-Fpe-rGel fusion constructs
showed only 9% and 12% reductions, respectively, after 72 hours
of incubation.
In addition, the immunotoxins were evaluated for cytotoxic activity following incubation in human plasma for 0, 24, 48, and 72
hours (Fig. 3C). For the C6.5-Fdt-rGel construct, the cell killing activity was reduced more than 2-fold after 48 hours, as indicated by
increasing IC50 values of 20 versus 48 nmol/L. However, this was
not the case for C6.5-L-rGel and C6.5-Fpe-rGel, which retained
most of its cytotoxic activity even after 48 hours and displayed a
little influence on IC50 after 72 hours of incubation in plasma (16
versus 22 nmol/L and 17 versus 25 nmol/L for each construct).
This functional stability analysis indicated that compared with

www.aacrjournals.org

the L and Fpe linkers, the Fdt linker was much more unstable in
human plasma, and this may reduce the in vivo potency of potential therapeutic applications using constructs containing this linker
design.
Mechanisms of cytotoxic effects. The cytotoxic effects
mediated by C6.5/rGel fusions were analyzed to evaluate whether
the cytotoxic mechanisms of the constructs observed included
elements of apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy in SKOV3 cells. As
shown in Fig. 4A, C6.5/rGel fusions did not show activation of
caspase-dependent apoptosis in SKOV3 cells and showed no cleavage of caspase substrate PARP. The terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) results
(Supplementary Fig. S1) confirmed that the cytotoxic effects of
the rGel-based fusions were not mediated by apoptosis and DNA
fragmentation.
To assess whether the necrotic cell death was induced, we examined lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, which is a marker of
abrupt membrane lysis (33). In this case, treatment of SKOV3 cells
with Triton X-100 serves as a positive control causing LDH release
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, treatment with the fusion
constructs failed to show LDH release, indicating that the observed
cytotoxicity did not seem to be a result of necrosis.
We next asked if the immunotoxins activate autophagic signaling in SKOV3 cells. MAP LC3-I, known to be usually present in the cytosol, is palmitoylated during autophagy to form
membrane-bound LC3-II and is associated with autophagosomes
(34). As shown in Fig. 4B, the ratio of LC3-II formation to the

β-actin control was increased after treatment with the fusion constructs, showing that autophagic flux was induced by C6.5/rGel
fusions in SKOV3 cells. In addition, autophagy induction by C6.5/
rGel fusions was further validated by the selective release of
HMGB1 (Fig. 4C). Tumor cells that are dying by autophagy selectively release the nuclear HMGB1 protein without displaying characteristics of necrosis (35). These data indicated that the observed
cytotoxic effects of C6.5/rGel fusions on SKOV3 cells seemed to be
mediated not through an apoptotic or necrotic mechanism but by
the efficient induction of autophagic cell death.
Antitumor activity of C6.5/rGel fusions in xenograft models.
We evaluated the ability of various C6.5/rGel fusion constructs to
inhibit the growth of established SKOV3 tumor xenografts in nude
mice after systemic administration. Tumors were induced in nude
mice by s.c. injection of SKOV3 cells on day 0, and treatment was
initiated on day 9 post-injection when the tumors were well estab-

lished. Treatment consisted of five i.v. injections every other day.
Groups of mice were treated at doses of 40 and 20 mg/kg for each
fusion construct. Control mice were treated with PBS or 20 mg/kg
rGel only. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, treatment with C6.5-L-rGel
exhibited a significant antitumor effect. Mice treated with the 40
mg/kg dose of C6.5-L-rGel showed a long-lasting antitumor effect
that lasted more than 1 month until the animals were sacrificed. In
mice treated with the 20 mg/kg dose, tumor growth was, in most
cases, arrested for the duration of the treatment and resumed a
couple of weeks after its completion. Otherwise, treatment of mice
with 40 mg/kg C6.5-Fpe-rGel resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth. This was similar to the effect observed with the same
dose of C6.5-L-rGel, but no significant effect could be observed at
the lower (20 mg/kg) dose level. In contrast, mice treated with
C6.5-Fdt-rGel at either dose (40 or 20 mg/kg) showed no specific
antitumor effect above that observed with rGel alone.

Novel Immunotoxins Targeting Her2/neu

Figure 5. Antitumor activity of C6.5/rGel immunotoxins against SKOV3 tumor
xenografts in nude mice. A and B, treatment of SKOV3 flank tumors with C6.5/
rGel fusions at doses of 40 and 20 mg/kg. Antitumor effects of i.v. injections of
PBS, rGel, C6.5-L-rGel, C6.5-Fpe-rGel, or C6.5-Fdt-rGel on SKOV3 tumors.
Mean tumor volume was calculated using the formula W × L × H as measured by
digital calipers. C, immunofluorescence staining of tumor samples after i.v.
injection of C6.5-L-rGel and rGel. Twenty-four hours after injection, the animal
was sacrificed and frozen tumor sections were prepared and detected by
anti-rGel antibody. Propidium iodide was used for DNA staining.

We next examined the localization of C6.5-L-rGel and rGel after
administration to mice bearing SKOV3 tumors. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that C6.5-L-rGel localized specifically
in tumor tissue, but no staining was observed in tumors after
administration of rGel itself (Fig. 5C). This suggests that the
fusion construct C6.5-L-rGel can effectively target tumor cells
overexpressing Her2/neu in vivo and can show significant tumor
growth–suppressive effects in the absence of observable toxicity.

Discussion
The development of recombinant immunotoxins has markedly
affected the field of targeted therapeutics by allowing numerous
molecular design approaches to engineer molecules with improved
in vitro and in vivo performance characteristics (36, 37). Detailed
investigations to design protein-based recombinant molecules

with reduced immunogenicity without affecting efficacy, toxicity,
or specificity have not generally focused on anti-Her2/neu agents
(26, 38, 39). To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first
comprehensive examinations of the effects of immunotoxin design
on the ability of constructs to effectively target in vitro and in vivo
cells expressing the Her2/neu oncogene product.
Previous studies have shown the potent in vitro and in vivo xenograft efficacy of immunotoxins containing murine scFv e23 (12,
13). However, in cancer patients, i.v. administration of e23-based
fusion constructs was shown to result in severe liver toxicity,
and effective doses could not be achieved (40, 41). The current
study shows that the human scFv C6.5 isolated and characterized
by Marks and colleagues binds to Her2/neu with high affinity (Kd
of 2.0 × 10−8 mol/L; ref. 22). rGel-based immunotoxins containing
either e23 or C6.5 were shown to have virtual identical patterns of
binding (ELISA), protein synthesis inhibitory activity (rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay), and internalization against both Her2/neupositive and Her2/neu-negative cell lines. Evaluation of the in vitro
cytotoxic effects of e23 and C6.5 fused to rGel showed that human
scFv C6.5 possessed a comparable affinity and specificity to the
murine e23 and could be regarded as an effective replacement.
We further described the construction and functional characteristics of novel C6.5/rGel constructs, with the introduction of
three different linker sequences. In addition to the flexible L linker
(GGGGS), two other furin cleavage linkers, namely, Fpe
(TRHRQPRGWEQL) from Pseudomonas exotoxin A and Fdt
(AGNRVRRSVG) from DT, were incorporated between the scFv
and the toxin.
Furin is a cellular endoprotease and has been implicated in the
proteolytic activation of large numbers of secreted proteins (29,
30). Inclusion of furin-cleavable linkers in fusion constructs containing ribotoxin, caspase-3, or granzyme B has resulted in a
significant improvement in specific toxicity compared with constructs containing stable linkers (42, 43). Our studies clearly
showed that incorporation of furin linkers into rGel-based constructs resulted in constructs with increased protease cleavage of
the rGel from the scFv carrier. However, this did not seem to make
a significant difference in the total levels of intracellular rGel, and
the in vitro specific cytotoxicity of the construct was not improved
compared with the more stable L linker. Intracellular trafficking of
rGel-based constructs does not seem to be consistent with the
model concept that the enzymatic dissolution of the link between
C6.5 and rGel by furin (or other enzymes) is a rate-limiting step in
determining the cytotoxic effects of rGel fusion toxins.
Depending on the lethal stimulus, tumor cells can die by distinct
cell death mechanisms including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy (44, 45). Although rGel-based immunotoxins have been used
in the treatment of malignant cancers for more than 15 years, the
actual mechanisms behind the induction of cell death have remained unclear (46, 47). In this study, we showed that C6.5/rGel
fusions had no effect on apoptosis-related mechanisms (PARP
cleavage, TUNEL, and DNA fragmentation) or necrosis-related mechanisms (LDH release). However, we clearly showed that the constructs induced autophagic cell death on SKOV3 cells as assessed
by LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and HMGB1 selective release. Further studies will be needed to determine whether the C6.5/rGel fusions induced general autophagic cell death among different cell
types, and whether autophagic cell death can be attributed to
other rGel-based immunotoxins.
Our initial goals for this study were to create an optimal construct targeting Her2/neu on tumor cell surfaces with relatively

low immunogenicity, thus providing an opportunity for long-term,
repeated administration, and with significant selectivity and stability. To that end, we performed a stability study in human plasma,
and the data showed that the C6.5-Fdt-rGel construct was the least
stable in binding activity and cytotoxicty after incubation because
of the highest cleavage sensitivity of the Fdt linker. On the other
hand, C6.5-L-rGel showed the highest degree of stability after incubation in plasma of all molecules tested. The in vivo antitumor
study further confirmed that C6.5-L-rGel was the most active construct against established tumor xenografts. The two companion
molecules with the furin-cleavable linkers showed significantly less
activity in vivo. The enzymatic stability of the linker between antibody and toxin can seriously affect the pharmacokinetics of immunotoxins and can apparently affect loss of targeting function and
in vivo efficacy.
The animal study presented highlights an additional point regarding the on-target toxicity for the immunotoxins in future clinical applications. On-target toxicity, or the toxicity of the construct
to normal tissues as a result of expression of the target antigen, is a
common problem that is addressed in clinical trials (48). In this
case, the C6.5 antibody does not cross-react with the murine
Her2/neu analogue. Therefore, the toxicity of the C6.5/rGel fusions
may be underestimated in these murine studies.
In conclusion, we have designed and developed several novel
immunotoxins containing the human scFv C6.5 and the toxin

rGel. These agents exhibit efficient cytotoxicity against Her2/neuoverexpressing tumor cells, and the human antibody seems to be
virtually identical as an effective carrier of rGel toxin to the murine
e23. The introduction of a furin-cleavable linker between C6.5 and
rGel did not result in improved intracellular rGel release and cytotoxic effects in vitro, despite showing more sensitivity to protease
cleavage. In addition, the incorporation of a furin-cleavable linker
resulted in a decrease in in vivo antitumor efficacy compared
with a noncleavable linker. These studies clearly show the highly
individualized nature of some payloads and targeted constructs,
and that observations about similar types of toxin payloads do
not necessarily translate to other payloads.
