Abstract
Recombinant immunotoxins (RIT) have been highly successful
in cancer therapy due, in part, to the high cancer-speciﬁc expression of cell surface antigens such as mesothelin, which is overexpressed in mesothelioma, ovarian, lung, breast, and pancreatic
cancers, but is limited in normal cells. RG7787 is a clinically
optimized RIT consisting of a humanized anti-mesothelin Fab
fused to domain III of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, in which immunogenic B-cell epitopes are silenced. To enhance the therapeutic
efﬁcacy of RITs, we conducted a kinome RNAi sensitization screen,
which identiﬁed discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a collagenactivated tyrosine kinase, as a potential target. The collagen/DDR1
axis is implicated in tumor–stromal interactions and potentially
affects tumor response to therapy. Therefore, we investigated the

effects of DDR1 on RIT. Knockdown of DDR1 by siRNA or
treatment with inhibitor, 7rh, greatly enhanced the cytotoxic
activity of RG7787 in several cancer cell lines. Investigation into
the mechanism of action showed DDR1 silencing was associated
with decreased expression of several ribosomal proteins and
enhanced inhibition of protein synthesis. Conversely, induction
of DDR1 expression or collagen-stimulated DDR1 activity protected cancer cells from RG7787 killing. Moreover, the combination of RG7787 and DDR1 inhibitor caused greater shrinkage of
tumor xenografts than either agent alone. These data demonstrate
that DDR1 is a key modulator of RIT activity and represents a
novel therapeutic strategy to improve targeting of mesothelinexpressing cancers. Cancer Res; 76(6); 1560–8. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

formation of neutralizing antibodies against the toxin in 90% of
patients. Combination with the T- and B-cell–depleting drugs,
pentostatin and cyclophosphamide, allowed prolonged dosing of
SS1P and resulted in striking regression of some advanced refractory mesotheliomas (10). To minimize PE immunogenicity and
improve clinical efﬁcacy, a reengineered version of SS1P called
RG7787 was developed in collaboration with Roche Innovation
Center (11). RG7787, currently in phase I of clinical trials, consists
of a humanized anti-MSLN Fab linked to a PE24 moiety generated
by silencing B-cell epitopes and truncating protease-sensitive
regions. In mice, RG7787 has a longer half-life than SS1P and
can be administered at a higher dose (11). Preclinical testing of
RG7787 showed tumor growth inhibition when used as a single
agent and signiﬁcant tumor regression in combination with taxol
in TNBC, gastric, and pancreatic cancer xenograft models (2, 12).
RITs are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis after the
binding of their antibody portion to the cell surface antigen.
Cleavage by a cellular protease, furin, separates the toxin moiety,
which then trafﬁcs to the endoplasmic reticulum via retrograde
transport. Once in the cytosol, the toxin ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2 prevents the elongation step of protein translation,
resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually cell
death. Understanding which proteins may inhibit toxin-mediated
cell killing is critical in designing combination therapies for
improved efﬁcacy of RITs. Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
are known to play a major role in cell survival and can be activated
by cells under stress. Previous work in our laboratory has shown
that the activity of SS1P can be enhanced by lowering levels of the
insulin receptor (13) or HCK or PDGFR2 or SRC (14). To expand
on this knowledge, we conducted a comprehensive kinome RNAi
screen to identify kinases that may regulate the activity of RITs.

Recombinant immunotoxins (RIT) are novel cytotoxic agents
composed of an antibody fragment (Fv or Fab) targeted to a cell
surface antigen and a protein toxin. Our laboratory has developed
RITs by attaching the catalytic domain of a potent bacterial toxin
Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) to fragments of antibodies targeting
cell surface antigens that exhibit relatively high cancer-speciﬁc
expression such as CD22 or mesothelin (MSLN; ref. 1). MSLN is a
cell surface glycoprotein whose expression is restricted to mesothelial cells. It is an excellent tumor target because it is highly
expressed in mesothelioma, lung, gastric, pancreatic, ovarian, and
triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC; refs. 2–8).
SS1P is the ﬁrst-generation PE38-based RIT targeted to MSLN.
While it showed a favorable safety proﬁle when tested as a single
agent in phase I clinical trials (9), its activity was limited due to the

DDR1 Inhibition Enhances Immunotoxin Therapy

Among the top hits identiﬁed from this screen was the RTK
discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1). In this study, we examined
the role of DDR1 in modulating activity of RG7787 and SS1P.
Collagen-mediated activation of DDR1 facilitates cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and matrix remodeling (15, 16).
Under physiologic conditions, DDR1 controls cell polarity and
tissue morphogenesis by acting as a collagen sensor. ECMmediated aberrant DDR1 activation contributes to the migratory and proinvasive phenotype of cancer cells. In several cancer
types, overexpression of DDR1 is correlated with the severity of
disease (17). The collagen/DDR1 axis also modulates tumor–
stromal interaction and potentially can affect tumor response
to therapy (18).
The aim of this study was to understand whether DDR1
regulates the cellular response to immunotoxins and whether
RG7787 activity can be enhanced by combination with a smallmolecule inhibitor of DDR1.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
A431 is an epidermoid cancer cell line that was obtained from
Dr. George Todaro (NCI, Bethesda, MD) in 1983. A431/H9 was
transfected to stably express MSLN (19). KB31 was provided by
Dr. Michael Gottesman (NCI, Bethesda, MD) in 1985. HAY
(mesothelioma) cell line was provided by Stehlin Foundation
for Cancer Research (Houston, TX) in 2004. A431/H9 cells were
veriﬁed by STR-PCR in 2014, KB31 in 2009 and HAY in 2012.
SUM149 (triple-negative breast cancer) were a gift from
Dr. Stanley Lipkowitz (NCI, Bethesda, MD), and authenticated
in 2013. KLM1 (pancreatic cancer) cells were provided by Dr. U.
Rudloff (NCI, Bethesda, MD) and their identity was veriﬁed in
2012. HT-1080 is a human ﬁbrosarcoma-derived cell line that was
originally obtained from ATCC in 2013. It was transfected to
express the tetracycline (Tet)-regulated transactivator Tet-Off
(pLVX-Tet-Off advanced; Clontech) by Marco Prunotto in 2013
and veriﬁed by STR-PCR in 2013. Inducible expression of human
DDR1b was achieved by transducing this cell line with a lentivirus
containing human DDR1b under the control of a tetracyclineresponsive promoter (pLVX-Tight-Puro; Clontech). Expression is
induced by the withdrawal of doxycycline from the culture
medium. Identity of tet-inducible cell lines was conﬁrmed by
STR testing in 2013. All cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium
(Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone; Thermo Scientiﬁc), 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies) in humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37 C. Native PE was produced as previously described
(20). SS1P was manufactured by Advanced Bioscience Laboratories, Inc and RG7787 was supplied by Roche Holding AG.
3
H-Leucine was purchased from Perkin Elmer and leucine-free
medium from Invitrogen. DDR1 inhibitor "7rh" was synthesized
as described (21).
Cell survival after DDR1 RNAi and DDR1 inhibitor
A431/H9 cells (3,000/well; 10 nmol/L siRNA) or KB cells
(2,800/well; 25 nmol/L siRNA) were reverse transfected using
Lipofectamine RNAi Max with scramble control siRNA (Ambion)
or DDR1 siRNA #9 or #10 in a 96-well plate for 48 hours followed
by treatment with different concentrations of RIT (SS1P, RG7787,
or native PE) for 72 hours. Sequences for siRNAs are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. To evaluate the effect of DDR1 inhibitor

7rh, cells were plated overnight and treated with 7rh for 3 hours
before treatment with RIT for 72 hours. ATP levels were measured
to assess cell viability using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent assay
(Promega). Data were normalized and shown as percent of
control.
Measurement of protein synthesis
Incorporation of radio-labeled leucine was used to measure
cellular protein synthesis. Brieﬂy, cells were reverse transfected for
48 hours or treated with 7rh for 3 hours, as described above,
followed by treatment with RIT for 18 hours. Media were replaced
with leucine-free medium containing 3H-Leucine (2 mCi/well) for
3 hours at 37 C. After a freeze–thaw cycle, plates were counted in a
microplate beta counter. Counts from wells containing only
medium with 3H-Leucine were used as background.
Collagen treatment
A431/H9 and KLM1 cells were plated on collagen I–coated
plates (Corning) overnight followed by treatment with soluble
collagen I (10 or 25 mg/mL; Invitrogen) for 3 to 6 hours before
treatment with various concentrations of RG7787. Images were
taken 48 hours after exposure to RG7787 using a Zeiss microscope
with a 10 EC Plan-NeoFluar objective using the AxioCam MRc
camera and the AxioVision 4.7.2 acquisition software.
DDR1 overexpression
The HT1080 (ﬁbrosarcoma) cell line was generated by stable
transfection with a DDR1b-inducible vector. DDR1 expression
was induced by culturing cells without doxycycline for 48 hours
and expression compared with cells grown with doxycycline. Cells
were treated with different concentrations of native PE for 48
hours and cell viability was assessed as described above.
Animal studies
A431/H9 cells (2  106) or KLM1 cells (4  106) supplemented
with Matrigel (4 mg/mL; BD Biosciences) were injected subcutaneously into the ﬂank of athymic nude mice. 7rh was dissolved in
DMSO: EtOH: Cremaphor EL: H2O ¼ 4:4:4:88. RG7787 was
dissolved in 0.1%HSA/Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS). When tumors
reached 120 to 150 mm3, DDR1 inhibitor 10 or 20 mg/kg 7rh was
given daily by oral gavage while 75 mg (3.75 mg/kg) RG7787 was
given by intravenous tail injection every other day. The group of
mice with combination treatment received RG7787 3 hours after
receiving 7rh. Tumor volume was measured every other day using
a digital caliper and calculated using the formula: 0.4  width2 
length. Liquid diet was provided if at least one mouse in an
experiment lost more than 2 g. Mice were euthanized when
tumors reached >500 mm3 in size or became necrotic. All animal
experiments were approved by the NCI Animal Care and Use
Committee and conducted according to the NIH guidelines.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed and statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism 6 software and Excel. Each experiment was
performed at least twice with 3 to 6 replicates per assay. Data are
presented as mean  SEM. Unpaired Student t test and one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons was performed. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
DDR1 knockdown enhanced activity of immunotoxins and
native PE
To identify regulators of the cytotoxicity of immunotoxins,
we performed a RNAi kinome screen in the KB cervical cancer
cell line (details will be reported elsewhere) and identiﬁed
DDR1 as a top candidate whose inhibition signiﬁcantly
enhanced cytotoxicity of SS1P [RSA (22); P < 0.001). In this
study, we began by treating a panel of cancer cells with two
siRNAs targeting DDR1 in combination with SS1P, RG7787, or
native PE. Treatment with the siRNA reduced DDR1 protein
levels in KB and A431/H9 cells (Fig. 1A and B) and enhanced
the cytotoxicity of the immunotoxins in all cell lines tested (Fig.
1C–I). The magnitude of enhancement varied among cell lines
from 2- to 50-fold. Table 1 summarizes the change in IC50 for
all cell lines treated with DDR1 siRNAs and RG7787. These
studies show that DDR1 can regulate immunotoxin activity in
multiple cancer types.

Immunotoxin internalization after DDR1 knockdown
Internalization of immunotoxins by receptor-mediated
endocytosis is required for immunotoxin action. We tested
whether enhanced activity of RG7787 after DDR1 knockdown
was associated with increased RIT internalization. A panel of
cell lines was transfected with control or DDR1-speciﬁc siRNAs
for 48 hours and treated with Alexa 647–labeled RG7787 for
varying times. Uptake as measured by FACs demonstrated
that Alexa-647-RG7787 internalization did not change significantly after DDR1 silencing in 3 of 4 cell lines, indicating
that enhanced activity of RG7787 after DDR1 knockdown is

mediated by a later step in the intoxication pathway (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C).
However, A431/H9 cells have increased internalization of
Alexa 647–labeled RG7787 after DDR1 silencing (Supplementary
Fig. S1D). Consistent with this observation, higher surface expression of MSLN was observed after DDR1 knockdown in A431/H9
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). To understand whether this was
due to increased MSLN expression, mRNA levels were measured
by RT-PCR. A 2-fold increase in mRNA levels was observed
following DDR1 silencing (Supplementary Fig. S2B). It has been
reported that miRNA198 regulates MSLN expression in transfected cells (23). DDR1 knockdown decreased miRNA198 levels
by 2-fold (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These data indicate that in
A431/H9 cells, DDR1 silencing can also regulate surface MSLN
expression and RG7787 uptake via miRNA198.
Effect of DDR1 knockdown on protein synthesis
PE-based RITs kill cells by inhibiting protein synthesis (24).
Therefore, we examined whether depleting DDR1 enhances toxinmediated inhibition of protein synthesis, A431/H9 or KB cells
were transfected with DDR1 siRNA for 48 hours, treated with
RG7787 for 18 hours, and then labeled with 3H-Leucine for 3
hours. In both KB and A431/H9 cells, DDR1 knockdown significantly enhanced protein synthesis inhibition (Fig. 2A and B).
We recently reported that knockdown of several ribosomal
proteins enhanced the cytotoxicity of SS1P (25). Loss of one or
more ribosomal proteins inhibits proper assembly of ribosomes
and protein synthesis (26, 27). RPL38, RPL24, and RPL10A were
identiﬁed amongst the top 5 sensitizers to RIT treatment in a
genome knockdown screen (25). To determine whether DDR1
knockdown affects these ribosomal proteins, we examined mRNA

(#9 and #10) was performed for 48 hours in KB and A431/H9 cells, respectively. Cells were harvested and lysates were subjected to Western blotting.
Blots were probed using anti-DDR1 or anti-actin antibodies. After transfection for 48 hours, KB cells were treated with varying concentrations of SS1P (C), RG7787 (D),
or native PE (E) for 72 hours. Effect on DDR1 knockdown on cytotoxicity of RG7787 (F) and PE (G) in A431/H9 cells are shown. Cell survival was measured
using CellTiter Glow ATP assay. Activity of RG7787 after DDR1 knockdown in HAY (H; mesothelioma) and KLM1 (I; pancreatic cancer) cells are shown. Data are
represented as percentage of control by normalizing to transfected cells treated with PBS alone. Each data point represents a mean of four replicates.

and protein expression of RPLs after transfection with control or
DDR1 siRNA in KB and A431/H9 cells. DDR1 knockdown lowered RPL22 mRNA levels but not the others (Supplementary Fig.
S3). However, DDR1 knockdown signiﬁcantly reduced protein
levels of RPL38, RPL24, RPL10A, and RPL22 by 40% to 90% in KB
and A431/H9 cells (Fig. 2C and D). Importantly, silencing of
RPL38 or RPL10A alone inhibits protein synthesis and this effect is
further enhanced by RG7787 (Fig. 2E–I). RPL24 or RPL22 did not
enhance RG7787 activity (data not shown). These results indicate

that RPL10A and RPL38 play a speciﬁc role in protein synthesis
inhibition and toxin activity.
DDR1 overexpression decreased sensitivity of native toxin
To evaluate the opposite effect (i.e., DDR1 protection from
toxin induced cell death) TET-off inducible DDR1b-overexpressing ﬁbrosarcoma (HT1080) cells were generated. Cells cultured
without doxycycline showed induction of DDR1 protein expression for 24 to 96 hours relative to cells cultured with doxycycline
(Fig. 3A). Increased expression results in a fully functional DDR1b
receptor as shown by the collagen-stimulated DDR1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B).
Because HT1080 cells do not express MSLN, we used native PE
to examine the effect of enhanced DDR1 expression on toxinmediated cell death. Cells cultured with and without doxycycline
were treated with varying concentrations of native PE and cell
viability was assessed. Figure 3C demonstrates that cells with high
expression of DDR1 (IC50 100 ng/mL) showed nearly 5-fold
resistance to killing by PE relative to cells with no DDR1 (IC50,
20 ng/mL). These data indicate that DDR1 negatively regulates the
activity of PE-based toxins and confers protection to cells from
PE-mediated killing.

knockdown, cell lysates were analyzed for the expression of ribosomal proteins by Western blot analysis using anti-RPL38, anti-RPL24, anti-RPL10A, and
anti-RPL22 antibodies. The relative band intensities were quantiﬁed (Multigauge software), normalized to actin levels, and represented as percentage of control. E

for 18 hours before assaying for protein synthesis by measuring incorporation of H-Leucine. I, knockdown of RPL38 or RPL10A by siRNAs was veriﬁed by

Induction of DDR1 expression protects cells from killing by the native PE. A, HT1080 cells transfected with inducible DDR1b vector were cultured in medium without
doxycycline (DOX) for indicated times while changing media daily. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis for DDR1 expression. B, cells were
cultured in serum-free medium for 24 hours with or without doxycycline for 48 hours before plating into dishes. Plated cells were stimulated with collagen I for 18
hours, then DDR1 phosphorylation was measured in the cell lysate by ELISA Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. C, cells cultured
in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 48 hours were treated with varying concentrations of native PE for 48 hours and cell viability assessed by ATP assay.
Results are presented as a percentage of the PBS-treated control.

Collagen protects cells from immunotoxin-mediated cell
killing
Deposition of collagen, abundant in tumor stroma, has been
shown to modulate therapeutic efﬁcacy of drugs (18, 28). DDR1
tyrosine kinase activity is activated by collagen I (15). We hypothesized that collagen will protect cells from killing by immunotoxins. To examine this, A431/H9 cells were plated in culture dishes
coated with or without collagen I and allowed to attach overnight.
Cells on collagen I–coated dishes were incubated with 25 mg/mL
soluble collagen I for 3 hours, followed by treatment with PBS or
100 ng/mL RG7787 for 48 hours. The photomicrographs shown
in Fig. 4 demonstrate that collagen I protects A431/H9, HAY, and
KLM1 cells from killing by RG7787. Treatment with RG7787
killed almost all cells on plastic dishes; however, more than 50%
cells survived in the presence of collagen I for all cell types
(Fig. 4). Because collagen is a ligand for DDR1, we measured
DDR1 activation in response to collagen I treatment. Growing

for 48 hours, then images were taken. Images shown are representative

A431/H9 and KLM1 cells in the presence of collagen I induced
DDR1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). These
data suggest that collagen protects cells from RG7787-mediated
killing via activation of DDR1 signaling.
Combination of DDR1 inhibitor enhanced toxin activity
Multikinase inhibitors such as nilotinib, dasatinib, and imatinib have been shown to inhibit DDR1 but are unselective (29).
We found that nilotinib enhanced the cytotoxic activity of
RG7787 in A431/H9 and KLM1 cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Recently, a more selective
inhibitor of DDR1, called 7rh, was reported (21). We found that
treatment with 7rh for 3 hours reduced phosphorylation of DDR1
in both KB and A431/H9 cells (Fig. 5A and B). Combining 7rh
with RG7787 increased cytotoxicity. KB cells are highly resistant to
RG7787 when treated as a single-agent, however, pretreatment
with 3 mmol/L 7rh resulted in up to a 100-fold enhancement in
cell killing [IC50 of >100 vs. 6 ng/mL (Fig. 5C)]. Similarly,
combination of 7rh and RG7787 resulted in 7- to 20-fold
enhancement relative to RG7787 treatment alone in several cell
lines (Fig. 5D–F; Table 1). Consistent with these observations
protein synthesis was signiﬁcantly decreased when cells were
pretreated with the combination relative to cells treated with
either drug alone (Fig. 5G–J). In addition, combination of 7rh
with either native PE or HB21-PE40, an immunotoxin targeted to
transferrin receptor, also reduced survival of multiple cancer cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6F). These data indicate that the
DDR1 inhibitor 7rh signiﬁcantly enhances cancer cell sensitivity
to PE-based immunotoxins.
7rh enhanced antitumor activity of RG7787 in A431/H9 and
KLM1 xenografts
We recently reported that RG7787 inhibits growth of pancreatic, breast, and stomach tumors in mice (2, 12), but does not
produce complete responses as a single agent. To investigate
whether 7rh can enhance the antitumor activity of RG7787,
A431/H9 cells were implanted subcutaneously in athymic nude
mice. After tumors reached an average volume 100 to 120 mm3,

DDR1 Inhibition Enhances Immunotoxin Therapy

harvested treated A431/H9 tumors and measured DDR1 phosphorylation by SDS-PAGE. The level of DDR1 phosphorylation
signiﬁcantly decreased (P < 0.05) in tumors after 7rh kinase
inhibitor treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Sustained treatment with 7rh in combination with
RG7787 resulted in improved antitumor effect. Tumors treated
with 7rh alone grew slower than vehicle-treated tumors. RG7787
halted tumor growth, but tumors started to regrow after day 12
despite continued treatment (Fig. 6A and B). In contrast, A431/H9
tumors treated with the 7rh/RG7787 combination shrank 34% by
day 8 (P < 0.0001) and showed continued shrinkage up to 61% by
day 22 (Fig. 6A). Tumor volume in vehicle-treated mice reached a
threshold of 400 mm3 at 10 days compared with an average of 20
days (range 18–22 days) for RG7787. Combination-treated mice
took an average of 33 days to reach this threshold (P < 0.0001).
Similar results were seen with KLM1 pancreatic tumors (Fig. 6B);
combination treatment resulted in 89% reduction in tumor
volume but RG7787 treatment alone, reduced tumor volume by
only 58% (P < 0.0001). Combination-treated KLM1 tumors did
not reach the 400 mm3 threshold volume over the 30-day course
of the experiment, while vehicle- and RG7787-treated tumors
grew to this size by day 17 and 27, respectively (P < 0.0001).
Overall, antitumor activity of RG7787 was enhanced by combination treatment relative to either drug alone in both A431/H9
and KLM1 tumor models.
These data suggest DDR1 inhibition as an excellent therapeutic
strategy to enhance in vivo efﬁcacy of RG7787.

anti-DDR1, or anti-actin antibody. C–F, KB, A431/H9, HAY, and KLM1 cells,
respectively, were treated with DDR1 inhibitor for 3 hours, followed
by varying concentrations of RG7787. After 72 hours, cell viability was
assessed by CellTiter Glow ATP assay. G–J, protein synthesis was measured

DDR1 is a tyrosine kinase that is activated by collagen and is
emerging as a regulator of tumor microenvironments in several
malignancies (17). RITs are novel anticancer drugs designed to kill
MSLN-expressing tumors such as lung, pancreatic, TNBC, and
mesothelioma (1, 2). Our current results show that DDR1 regulates activity of RITs; silencing of DDR1 enhanced killing by RITs,
whereas induction of DDR1 expression decreased sensitivity of
cancer cells to toxin. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report
implicating a matrix-regulating tyrosine kinase like DDR1 in the
regulation of immunotoxin-based cancer therapy. Moreover, we
showed that collagen protects cancer cells from killing by RG7787
and this effect may be mediated by DDR1. Preventing this
activation with a novel DDR1 kinase inhibitor, 7rh, signiﬁcantly
enhanced antitumor activity of RG7787 in epithelial and pancreatic tumor models.
The discoidin domain receptor subfamily consists of DDR1 and
DDR2. Both are activated by ﬁbrillary collagens, but they differ in
their cellular expression pattern and preference for collagen type
(16). DDR1 is implicated in cancer progression due to its role in
cancer cell survival, migration, and adhesion; however, little is
known about the role of DDR2 in cancer, if any. In a kinome RNAi
screen, we saw enhancement of RIT activity by DDR1 silencing,
and saw no changes in the activity of RITs after knockdown of
DDR2. While there is limited knowledge about signaling downstream of DDR1, various studies have shown that overexpression
and activation of DDR1 results in activation of the MAPK, PI3K,
Janus kinase, and NF-kB pathways (30). It has also been reported
that DDR1 is a transcriptional target of p53 under genotoxic stress,
and that inhibition of DDR1 sensitizes WT p53-expressing cells
to apoptosis under these conditions (31). We found that
DDR1 inhibition enhanced antitumor activity of RIT in both WT

DDR1 inhibitor 7rh enhances antitumor activity of RG7787 in A431/H9 and pancreatic cancer KLM1 xenograft tumor models. Female athymic nude mice were
3
subcutaneously injected with A431/H9 (A) or KLM1 (B) tumor cells. When tumors reached 100 to 120 mm , mice were treated with vehicle, 7rh alone, RG7787 alone, or
a combination of 7rh and RG7787. The 7rh (20 mg/kg) was given daily by oral gavage starting on day 5 (indicated by small arrows) for a total of 16 doses.
RG7787 (75 mg) was administered by intravenous tail injection every other day starting on day 6 for a total of eight doses, as indicated by long arrows. Each data point
represents average of mean tumor volume of 4 to 7 mice per group that were followed over time from the day of inoculation. Statistically signiﬁcant difference
in tumor volume was observed between mice treated with RG7787 alone compared with the mice treated with the combination starting from day 8
and this difference was maintained during the course of experiment. Results shown are representative of more than two similar experiments.

(A431/H9) and mutant (KLM1) p53 tumors, indicating inhibition of DDR1 may be an attractive strategy to enhance therapeutic
efﬁcacy of RITs.
Consistent with the established prosurvival role of DDR1 in
cancers, we have shown here that overexpression of DDR1 protects cells from RITs, while DDR1 silencing or small-molecule
inhibition enhances killing by RITs. Knockdown or inhibition of
DDR1 enhanced inhibition of protein synthesis by RG7787.
Together, these data provide strong evidence that DDR1 regulates
the toxin intoxication pathway through regulating protein synthesis either directly or indirectly. Consistent with this observation, reduction of DDR1 was associated with decrease in ribosomal proteins, RPL10A, RPL24, and RPL38 that play a pivotal
role in ribosome assembly and protein synthesis (24). Silencing of
RPL10A and RPL38 but not RPL22 and RPL24 inhibited protein
synthesis. This selective role of RPL38 is consistent with previous
reports illustrating translation of speciﬁc mRNAs of prosurvival
genes by RPL38 (32). The mechanism of how DDR1 regulates
expression of ribosomal proteins is beyond the scope of this
article and is currently under investigation. Nonetheless, these
data strongly suggest a novel role of DDR1 in modulating protein
synthesis via ribosomal proteins.
Collagen is the most abundant component of the ECM and is
thought to play a role in cancer progression and resistance to
therapy via aberrant signaling. In particular, pancreatic cancer is
known to have a collagen-dense stroma (18) and is resistant to
most standard therapeutics. Recently, Aguilera and colleagues
have shown that resistance to VEGF therapy in an animal model
of pancreatic cancer is due to collagen-mediated DDR1 activation
(18). Cader and colleagues also reported collagen/DDR1-mediated protection of Hodgkin lymphoma cells from chemotherapy
(28). It has been reported that DDR1 causes chemoresistance by
activating NF-kB pathway and its target COX2 (30). This is the ﬁrst
study reporting that collagen protects cancer cells from killing by a
RIT and that this protection can be overcome by combining RIT

with the DDR1 inhibitor, 7rh. We found a signiﬁcant antitumor
response with the combination of 7rh and RG7787 in xenograft
mouse models of epithelial and pancreatic cancer. The maximum
tolerated single dose for RG7787 in mice is 150 mg. We were able
to achieve a therapeutic effect at half the MTD. Repeated dosing is
needed for maximal effect in mice. Because humans metabolize
the drugs more slowly than mice, it usually requires about 10%
as much drug to be effective in humans. For example, for HA22,
the effective dose in humans is 50 mg/kilo, whereas in mice it is
400 mg/kilo. So 75 mg of RG7787/20 grams would translate into
3.75 mg/kilo in mice or 375 kg/kilo in humans. RG7787 is now
in clinical testing but a safe dose has not yet been established.
DDR1 inhibitor 7rh is under preclinical testing and newer
inhibitors are being developed. In addition, nilotinib inhibits
DDR1 and is approved for the treatment of several malignancies (29). We found that combining nilotinib with RG7787
signiﬁcantly enhanced cytotoxic activity in epithelial and pancreatic cancer cells. Nilotinib also enhanced activity of SS1P
(David Fitzgerald; personal communication). Therefore, it has
the potential to be used in combination with immunotoxins in
clinical trials.
We propose that resistance to killing of cancer cells by RG7787
in the presence of collagen is mediated by DDR1. In addition to
DDRs, integrins are also activated by collagen and thought to play
a role in ECM remodeling. While it has been reported that
collagen-mediated DDR1 activation does not require integrins
(33), DDR1 induction was shown to cooperatively activate b1
integrins to mediate cell adhesion (34). Knockdown of integrins
did not alter RIT activity (25) therefore; it is likely that protection
of cells by collagen is primarily mediated by DDR1. Our ﬁndings
indicate that DDR1 inhibition may be a good strategy to inhibit
collagen-mediated resistance to therapeutics. Our in vivo data
provide strong support for this.
In summary, this study presents a clinically relevant ﬁnding that
collagen protects cancer cells from killing by RITs by activating

DDR1 Inhibition Enhances Immunotoxin Therapy

DDR1, and inhibition of DDR1 enhances killing of many cancer
cell types by RITs. Our data support the use of DDR1 inhibitors in
combination with RITs to enhance their clinical efﬁcacy.
