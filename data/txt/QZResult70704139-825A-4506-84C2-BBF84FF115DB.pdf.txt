Abstract
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) effectively
eradicates multiple myeloma (MM) cells, partly by activating
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptotic signaling.
However, MM recurrences in bortezomib-treated patients are
invariable. We have shown that ER stress signaling can also
induce growth arrest and survival in cancer cells. Thus, we
hypothesized that bortezomib therapy could induce quiescence and survival of residual MM cells, contributing to disease
recurrence. Here, we report that in MM cells, proteasome
inhibition with MG-132 or bortezomib results in a surviving
cell fraction that enters a prolonged quiescent state (G0-G1
arrest). Mechanism analysis revealed that bortezomibsurviving quiescent cells attenuate eIF2A phosphorylation
and induction of the ER stress proapoptotic gene GADD153.
This occurs independently of the eIF2A upstream kinases
PERK, GCN2, and PKR. In contrast, the prosurvival ERchaperone BiP/Grp78 was persistently induced. The bortezomib-surviving quiescent fraction could be eradicated by a
simultaneous or sequential combination therapy with salubrinal, an inhibitor of GADD34-PP1C phosphatase complex, and,
in consequence, eIF2A dephosphorylation. This effect was
mimicked by expression of a phosphorylated mimetic eIF2AS51D mutant. Our data indicate that bortezomib can induce
growth arrest in therapy-surviving MM cells and that attenuation of eIF2A phosphorylation contributes to this survival.
Most importantly, this survival mechanism can be blocked by
inhibiting eIF2A dephosphorylation. Thus, strategies that
maintain eIF2A in a hyperphosphorylated state may be a
novel therapeutic approach to maximize bortezomib-induced
apoptosis and reduce residual disease and recurrences in this
type of cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(4):1545–52]

Introduction
Proteasome inhibitors induce multiple myeloma (MM) cell
apoptosis by modulating several pathways, including endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress signaling (1). In the clinic, bortezomib is now
widely used in patients with refractory or relapsed MM and is also
being studied as an adjunct to first-line therapies (1). However, the
use of prolonged bortezomib therapy has lead to the development
of drug resistance (1). Drug resistance has been linked to enhanced

ER stress signaling and increased chaperone expression (1, 2),
which may be an adaptive capacity of MM cells.
Proteasome inhibitors induce an ER stress response in MM cells
contributing to apoptosis (2, 3). However, a primary function of ER
stress signaling is also to adapt to exogenous stress and induce
growth arrest and survival. This is achieved in part by reducing
cyclin D1 levels (4) and inducing protein folding and degradation
genes that alleviate the damage caused by unfolded proteins. Thus,
it could be anticipated that growth arrest and survival may be a
response to proteasome inhibitor therapy.
Depending on the activation intensity and cellular context, eIF2a
phosphorylation by upstream kinases, like PERK or GCN2, can
induce survival, growth arrest, and/or apoptosis in response to ER
stress (5, 6). We showed that eIF2a signaling was linked to the
induction and maintenance of HEp3 head and neck squamous
carcinoma cell dormancy and survival (5, 7, 8). Growth arrest (i.e.,
dormancy) is in part due to PERK-dependent phosphorylation of
eIF2a, which leads to the down-regulation of cyclins D1/D3 and
cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Survival and resistance to
chemotherapy, on the other hand, is due to induction of BiP, ATF6
activation, and also eIF2a phosphorylation (5, 8). In other cases,
very intense eIF2a phosphorylation can activate apoptotic
programs (9). The capacity of eIF2a signaling to decide cell fate
in response to stress might be particularly important for MM
patients treated with proteasome inhibitors, as different levels of
stress may impinge on the cells during this therapy.
We set out to explore the link between proteasome inhibition,
activation of ER stress, and growth arrest in MM cells. We
hypothesized that proteasome inhibition with MG-132 or bortezomib in clinically relevant concentrations may force cells into a
growth arrest/survival program due to an ER stress adaptation
response. This could be a potential contributor to therapy
resistance and disease recurrence. We further hypothesized that
maximizing ER stress signaling could enhance sensitivity to
proteasome inhibitors by tipping the balance from signaling for
growth arrest/survival to apoptosis. Here, we report that a fraction
of MM cells, surviving a single treatment with bortezomib, downregulate eIF2a phosphorylation and enter a prolonged G0-G1 arrest.
More importantly, the quiescent surviving fraction of MM cells
with different genetic abnormalities could be almost completely
eradicated by enhancing eIF2a phosphorylation with salubrinal
(an inhibitor of GADD34-PP1c complex assembly) or by expression
of a phosphorylated mimetic eIF2aS51D protein. Our findings
reveal that enhancement of ER stress signaling can be exploited as
a strategy to maximize efficiency of proteasome inhibitor therapy.

and bortezomib (4 nmol/L) strongly induced cell death (sub-G0
population) in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A). This may be
due to an initial (4–8 hours) G2-M arrest, as determined by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (data not shown) and in
accordance with the data in other systems (11). We next explored
the fate of MM cells surviving proteasome inhibitor therapy. RPMI
8226 cells treated with 400 nmol/L MG-132 for 24 hours were
washed to remove the drug. We found that the absolute number of
viable cells that were then replated remained constant for 7 days. In
contrast, vehicle-treated cells initiated exponential growth after 48
hours (Fig. 1B). The lack of expansion in the surviving cells was not
due to a balance between proliferating and dying cells but to a
growth arrest as shown by PI staining followed by flow cytometry
(Fig. 1C). Cell cycle analysis revealed that the number of cells in
G0-G1 increased significantly from f35% in the control population
to f55% to 65% in the cells surviving proteasome inhibition
(Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained using 4 nmol/L bortezomib,
a dose that is pharmacodynamically achievable in patients (Fig. 1D,
top; ref. 12). The arrest was due to a failure to transit the G1-S
boundary because, 72 hours after washout of proteasome
inhibitors, there was an intermediate (Ser780) to strong reduction
(Ser795/807/811) in phosphorylated Rb protein levels. These Ser
residues are phosphorylated to promote G1-S transition (Fig. 1D,
bottom). Our results show that two proteasome inhibitors are able
to induce G0-G1 arrest in RPMI 8226 MM cells after a single
treatment.
To corroborate our cell cycle analysis, we performed double
labeling with CFSE and Hoechst-33342 to measure viable CFSE
retaining cells and to gate out sub-G0 cells. CFSE, due to its
irreversible esterification onto cellular proteins and its equal distribution within daughter cells, can be used to monitor cell division
(13). We found a highly significant f4-fold to 7-fold increase in the
percentage of CFSE-positive cells at 72 hours in cells surviving both
MG-132 and bortezomib (Fig. 2A and B), suggesting that at
72 hours, after the washout of proteasome inhibitors, the surviving
cells divide to a lesser extent. These results indicate that, whereas
proteasome inhibition can cause acute apoptosis, the surviving MM
cells rapidly enter a G0-G1 arrest. Given that pharmacologic treatments do not reach maximal lethal doses in all targeted cells, the
induction of a growth-arrested surviving fraction adapting to the
treatment may be a possible side effect of proteasome inhibition.
Bortezomib-surviving cells attenuate eIF2A phosphorylation and uncouple the induction of proapoptotic from
prosurvival ER stress genes. We next investigated if the cells
surviving proteasome inhibitors undergo any specific changes in
ER stress signaling. Proteasome inhibitors are known to induce an
unfolded protein response (UPR) in MM cells by inhibition of the
ER-associated degradation pathway (2, 14). Furthermore, UPR
mediates cell survival and drug resistance in several models,
including MM (5, 8, 15). We were interested in the phosphorylation
of eIF2a, which attenuates translation and induces a selective gene
expression program as an adaptive response to ER stress. We also
monitored the expression of the prosurvival chaperone BiP/Grp78
(5, 8), the transcription factor XBP-1 (5), and the proapoptotic
transcription factor CHOP (10). MG-132 treatment caused
increased eIF2a phosphorylation (Fig. 3A and B), XBP-1 splicing
(Fig. 3C), BiP (Fig. 3D), and CHOP (Fig. 3C) up-regulation in the
acute phase (8–24 hours). This was not associated with changes in
the phosphorylation of the eIF2a upstream kinases PERK, GCN2,
and PKR (Fig. 3B). With the exception of BiP, which was strongly
induced, the expression of CHOP mRNA, spliced XBP-1, or

increased eIF2a phosphorylation did not persist in the surviving
cells (Fig. 3A–D). Phosphorylation of p38 was also activated both by
MG-132 and bortezomib, and p38 remained phosphorylated in the
surviving quiescent cells (data not shown). This suggests that, as
reported (16), p38 activation can have a prosurvival role in MM
cells. BiP can induce survival in other cancer cells (5, 17–19),
suggesting that these functions might be preserved during
quiescence induced by proteasome inhibitors in MM cells.

Interestingly, both CHOP induction and XBP-1 splicing are only
observed during the acute phase and both are then down-regulated
in the surviving cells. The functional role for the down-regulation of
XBP-1 splicing is not clear. However, it is possible that downregulation of CHOP eliminates the proapoptotic function of this
gene (20), further promoting survival of the residual MM cells.
Although the levels of phosphorylated eIF2a kinases did not
change in acute treatments or after proteasome inhibitor washout,
eIF2a phosphorylation was consistently down-regulated. This
suggests that other mechanisms may be responsible for this event.
Pharmacologic or genetic enhancement of eIF2A phosphorylation potentiates bortezomib-induced cell death minimizing
the surviving cell fraction. Loss of eIF2a phosphorylation and
of its downstream target CHOP in the surviving fraction may be
associated with an evasion of apoptosis, as enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2a can induce cell death (21). Thus, we tested
whether sustained eIF2a phosphorylation in the surviving cells
would limit their survival after bortezomib treatment. To this end,
we used salubrinal, an inhibitor of GADD34-PP1c complex
assembly and, therefore, eIF2a-dephosphorylation, identified in a
screen for small molecules protecting from ER stress (22). We
tested whether salubrinal would enhance bortezomib cytotoxicity
acutely and, more importantly, in the fraction of MM cells surviving
proteasome inhibitor treatment. At a dose of 5 Amol/L, salubrinal
had no effect on the basal viability or growth of RPMI 8226 (Fig. 4A)
despite inducing eIF2a phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Thus, this
salubrinal dose was used for treating MM cells in combination
with bortezomib or after proteasome inhibitor treatment. This
would reveal if maintaining this phosphorylation could potentiate
bortezomib-induced killing in the acute phase and also cause
death of the surviving cells. As mentioned above, salubrinal alone
resulted in increased phosphorylation of eIF2a at 8 hours.
However, proteasome inhibition alone caused even higher p-eIF2a
levels than salubrinal (Fig. 4B). Combining salubrinal and the

proteasome inhibitor resulted in the highest levels of p-eIF2a at
8 hours in RPMI 8226 MM cells, suggesting that this combination
can potentiate the activation of this pathway (Fig. 4B). Treatment
with salubrinal, bortezomib, and the combination of both
decreased the activation of PERK marginally whereas no effects
could be seen on the activation of GCN2, and PKR was only slightly
induced by 10 Amol/L salubrinal (Fig. 4B and Supplementary
Fig. S2). This suggests that the observed induction of eIF2a
phosphorylation by salubrinal, proteasome inhibitors, and the
combination of both is mediated for the most part by pathways
other than PERK, GCN2, and PKR (Fig. 4B). Combination of MG132 or bortezomib with salubrinal on RPMI 8226 or U266B1 cells
for 12 and 24 hours did not further enhance eIF2a phosphorylation
but resulted in pronounced cleavage of eIF2a (not observed at
8 hours). This was reported to depend on caspase-3 activation and
is indicative of an irreversible cellular commitment to apoptosis
(Fig. 4C and D; ref. 23). Consistent with these findings, acute
combination of salubrinal with bortezomib also caused a strong
induction of the mRNA for the proapoptotic gene CHOP (Fig. 4D,
right), which suggests that the enhancement of bortezomibinduced apoptosis by salubrinal is due to strong proapoptotoic
mediators regulated by this transcription factor (24).
While in both RPMI 8226 and U266B1 cells, MG-132 or
bortezomib alone caused roughly 40% to 50% cell death at
24 hours, salubrinal could further augment this effect to roughly
70% to 90% (Fig. 5A), which is in agreement with the activation of
apoptotic signals. It is unknown if salubrinal can also inhibit other
PP1c complexes, but the initial study argues for this compound
being highly specific for the GADD34-PP1c complex (22). We cannot
rule out that other targets of GADD34-PP1c might contribute to
the observed effect. However, our data, obtained by transfecting
RPMI 8226 cells with a phosphorylated mimetic eIF2aS51D
mutant (25), strongly suggest that the effect is specific for
GADD34-PP1c activity on eIF2a (Fig. 5B). Transient transfection

Salubrinal Potentiates Bortezomib Therapy in MM Cells

efficiency in these cells using electroporation is f50% (data not
shown), and cell death was enhanced by around the same
magnitude when combining eIF2aS51D overexpression with
proteasome inhibition (Fig. 5B). Thus, it can be deduced that
majority of MM cells expressing the eIF2aS51D mutant were more
sensitive to bortezomib.
Finally and most importantly, we tested whether salubrinal
treatment of the cells that are arrested but still surviving
proteasome inhibition will affect their viability. Treatment of this
MM cell population with 5 Amol/L salubrinal, which does not
affect the control population, caused f10-fold reduction in the
number of viable cells after 24 hours (Fig. 5C). This was
comparable with the effect observed using the combination
therapy (Fig. 5C). The effect could still be observed in quiescent
cells 5 days after the bortezomib treatment (Fig. 5D). Thus, these
cells, while still growth arrested, are in a high ER stress condition,

evidenced by the high Grp78 levels, and remain highly sensitive
to salubrinal. These results further suggest that the reduction
in p-eIF2a observed after bortezomib treatment is indeed a
mechanism to evade apoptosis.

Discussion
Exploring mechanisms that might induce quiescence in cancer
cells led us to test the hypothesis that therapies known to induce
the UPR might be the cause of a protective response in cancer cells
(5, 7, 8). We had previously shown that head and neck cancer cells
(HNSCC) entered a state of cellular dormancy, which was linked to
the activation of ER stress pathways that, in a concomitant fashion,
promoted both growth arrest and survival (5, 7, 8). These are the
same pathways that can be activated by proteasome inhibitors
(1, 2, 14), which led us to reason that proteasome inhibition with

MG-132 and the clinically used drug bortezomib (Velcade) might
induce quiescence and persistence of cells surviving the therapy.
Several findings are worth discussing. We discovered that,
whereas a portion of MM cells treated with proteasome inhibitors
die, a significant fraction (30–50% of the cells) could adapt to the
stress and survive by entering a protracted state of quiescence. The
fact that f30% to 50% of the cells survive suggests that the G0-G1
arrest is more likely due to treatment adaptation than to selection
of a cell population genetically predisposed to undergo quiescence.
This response is plausible as one function of ER stress signaling is
to allow cells to pause proliferation while unfolding of proteins in
the ER is being corrected (6, 26). This ultimately leads to cell
survival and, in the context of MM, may allow for recurrence.
We cannot rule out that this response may also be operational in
MM cells with preexistent mutations that confer resistance to
bortezomib (27). If true, this adaptive response, which seems to be
functional in a large proportion of cells, may further accelerate the
selection of these underrepresented clones. However, such
hypothesis needs to be tested.
We also found that survival of the residual quiescent cells hinges
on the down-regulation of eIF2a phosphorylation, which allows
these cells to silence proapoptotic signals downstream of eIF2a
signaling. This was primarily evidenced by the loss of CHOP mRNA
expression. The silencing of CHOP might be an important

apoptosis escape mechanism, as this transcription factor was
shown to repress Bcl-2 expression and at the same time induce
expression of BimEL (24), a powerful proapoptotic protein.
First and importantly, we found a potential solution to the
problem by combining bortezomib treatment with salubrinal, an
inhibitor of GADD34-PP1c complex assembly. Maintaining eIF2a
phosphorylation through drugs like salubrinal can potentiate
killing of MM cells, and they may serve as an adjuvant therapy to
proteasome inhibitors when given simultaneously. Second and
more importantly, salubrinal can virtually eliminate the fraction of
quiescent MM cells surviving proteasome inhibition. We therefore
propose that salubrinal or similar compounds affecting phosphorylation of eIF2a may serve as a potential strategy to maximize
proteasome inhibitor efficiency and decrease MM cell resistance to
this substance class. The ability of salubrinal to potentiate killing of
MM cells by enhancing eIF2a phosphorylation is in accordance
with previous models hypothesizing a sigmoidal relationship
between stress intensity and eIF2a activation leading to survival
at very low and apoptosis at very high levels (9). Thus, the
enhancement of eIF2a phosphorylation during MG-132 or
bortezomib treatment prevents MM cells to modulate this pathway
to adapt to and survive ER stress.
This response was observed in two MM cell lines with different
genetic alterations [c-MYC insertion on t(16;22)(q32;q11):der16 in

salubrinal observed 3 d posttreatment could still be observed at 5 d after proteasome inhibitor washout, suggesting that the sensitivity to salubrinal postproteasome
inhibition is long lasting.

Salubrinal Potentiates Bortezomib Therapy in MM Cells

RPMI 8226 and t(11;14) in U266B1], suggesting that it may not be
linked to a given genotype. Still, as discussed above, this does not
rule out that it may, in the long-term, favor the expansion of
clones predisposed to resist bortezomib therapy. We also found
that, while diffuse B-cell lymphoma U937 cells were highly
sensitive to 4 nmol/L bortezomib and K-562 chronic myeloid
leukemia cells were intermediately sensitive, neither of these cell
lines were susceptible to an enhancement of bortezomib-induced
killing by salubrinal (data not shown). Furthermore, neither
bortezomib alone nor its combination with salubrinal were
effective in inducing killing of HEp3 HNSCC or Raji Burkitt’s
lymphoma cells (data not shown). This suggests that the
combination therapy using a proteasome inhibitor and salubrinal
may be mostly suited for the treatment of MM.
We hypothesize that the induction of XBP-1 during the acute
phase of bortezomib treatment is most likely associated with a
survival/adaptation response (5, 15, 28). It is possible that, whereas
XBP-1 may function to protect cells during the acute phase, its
ability to lead to the prolonged induction of chaperones, such as
BiP/grp78, may prevent apoptosis in the cells surviving the
treatment. This response may be related to the inherent capacity
of the UPR to protect from subsequent insults to the ER (9). Thus,
prolonged survival of the quiescent fraction may be linked to the
abundant induction of BiP/grp78. Previous studies provided
compelling evidence for a prosurvival function for this chaperone
in cancer (5, 17–19). Thus, it is possible that, in addition to the
inhibition of GADD34-PP1c and enhancement of p-eIF2a signaling,
blockade of Grp78 expression and/or function may be an
additional strategy to prevent adaptation and survival of MM
and other cancer cells to bortezomib treatment. Similar strategies
applied to identify HSP90 inhibitors (29, 30) may be successful in
identifying small molecule inhibitors specific for Grp78.
Several upstream kinases, such as PERK, PKR, and GCN2, can
phosphorylate eIF2a (26). Our study revealed that during the acute
phase there was only a marginal modulation of PERK, PKR, and
GCN2 activation. Thus, their functional contribution to the growth
arrest remains to be elucidated. It is also unclear whether the
down-regulation of eIF2a phosphorylation is solely due to
GADD34-PP1c expression/activity. Still, our data support that this

is the most plausible option. What seems to be evident from our
results is that in both acute and post–bortezomib treatments with
salubrinal the strong phosphorylation of eIF2a is associated with
apoptosis. Studies in HNSCC cells showed that, whereas PERK and
eIF2a signaling can contribute to survival, persistent eIF2a
signaling is also linked to the quiescent state (5). In the case of
MM cells, phosphorylation of eIF2a does not persist posttreatment
during the quiescence phase. This suggests that the growth arrest is
linked to other mechanisms or that persistent eIF2a phosphorylation is not needed for this effect.
Whereas Rb phosphorylation in sites that are indicative of G1
exit was reduced after proteasome inhibition, we failed to detect
significant changes in CDK or cyclin protein levels (data not
shown). Only p21 induction was observed in the acute phase but
not in the surviving fraction of arrested cells (data not shown). We
speculate that this acute induction is sufficient to induce the longterm MM cell arrest and that this or other mechanisms (i.e., p15
and p16 induction) maintain cyclin/CDK complexes inactive for
prolonged periods.
In summary, we report that the induction of MM tumor cell
quiescence and survival can be an undesirable side effect of
proteasome inhibition. We also show that, by blocking eIF2a
dephosphorylation, proteasome inhibitor efficiency can be maximized during acute treatment and that residual cells can be
eliminated by nontoxic doses of salubrinal as a monotherapy for
MM minimal residual disease after proteasome inhibition.
