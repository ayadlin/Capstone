Abstract
Crassocephalum rabens (Asteraceae) is a popular antiinflammatory folk medicine and food supplement. We
investigated the cancer chemopreventive bioactivity of C.
rabens phytocompounds in vitro and in vivo using cell- and
gene-based bioassays and a mouse B16 melanoma model.
The bioactive glyceroglycolipid 1,2-di-O-A-linolenoyl-3-O-Bgalactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol (dLGG) that was identified from
C. rabens was found in vitro and in vivo to be a potent nitric
oxide (NO) scavenger. dLGG treatment inhibited both mRNA
and protein expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in murine macrophages and inhibited
COX-2 gene transcription in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate (TPA)–treated B16 cells. In immunohistochemical
studies, dLGG inhibited TPA-induced expression of COX-2
and nitration of proteins in mouse skin. dLGG could also
significantly inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 production in murine macrophages. Furthermore,
dLGG prevented nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic nuclear
factor-KB (NF-KB) by suppressing IKBA phosphorylation and
degradation. Structure-activity relationship study by electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that the dilinolenoylglycerol moiety in dLGG is the essential structural feature
preventing NF-KBDNA complex formation. A dLGG-enriched
extract from C. rabens (10 mg/kg) markedly suppressed B16
melanoma growth in C57BL/6J mice following i.p. administration, an effect comparable with that of cisplatin, a cancer
chemotherapeutic drug. This study shows the detailed
molecular mechanism(s) underlying the anti-inflammatory
and tumor-suppressive effects of a natural galactolipid.

Introduction
Cancer chemoprevention concerns the use of natural or
synthetic substances, alone or as a mixture, to reduce the risk of
development or recurrence of cancer (1, 2). In recent years, the
anticancer potential of many phytocompounds has been shown
in vitro or in vivo in animal models (3): polyphenols in the leaves of
tea (Camellia sinensis), for example, inhibits tumorigenesis and
tumor growth (4, 5). The pressing need for such anticancer agents

has spurred the search for phytocompounds from other sources
and with novel modes of action.
Nitric oxide (NO) and its metabolite, peroxynitrite, are mutagenic
because they can deaminate DNA and inactivate DNA repair
enzymes (6, 7). NO is produced by the oxidative deamination of
L-arginine at inflammatory sites by inducible NO synthase (iNOS),
which is expressed in response to a variety of proinflammatory
cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; refs. 8, 9).
Improper expression of iNOS has been associated with the
pathophysiology of certain human cancers and inflammatory
disorders (10). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is another important
enzyme in the pathophysiology of inflammation and carcinogenesis
(11, 12) through its synthesis of the precursors of prostaglandins
and thromboxanes. COX-2 is expressed within human tumor
neovasculature as well as in neoplastic cells in human prostate,
colon, breast, and lung cancer tissues (13, 14). Because inflammation is closely linked to tumor promotion, substances with potent
anti-inflammatory activities are also anticipated to have chemopreventive effects on carcinogenesis (15), especially selective
inhibitors of both COX-2 and iNOS (16, 17).
Nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), one of the principal inducible
transcription factors in mammals, plays a pivotal role in inflammation through regulation of COX-2 and iNOS expression (10). NF-nB
signaling involves an integrated sequence of protein-regulated steps,
many of which are potential targets for inflammation and cancer
treatments. NF-nB is maintained as an inactive cytoplasmic form
through its association with an inhibitory molecule InB. Exposure of
cells to a variety of external stimuli, including cytokines, radiation,
LPS, and reactive oxygen species, causes rapid phosphorylation of
InB, with subsequent dissociation and proteosomic degradation,
allowing activated free NF-nB dimers to translocate to the nucleus
(18) and induce transcription of many target genes (19). Several
phytocompounds have been shown to inhibit COX-2 and iNOS
expression by blocking improper NF-nB activation (20, 21). The NFnB pathway provides exciting incentives to search for novel active
phytocompounds in medicinal plants (22).
Crassocephalum rabens (Asteraceae) is a popular herbal
medicine and food supplement in Taiwan for various inflammation-related syndromes. As there was no information about the
truth of this reputation, we investigated in vivo and in vitro the
anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive properties of
extracts and purified phytocompounds from C. rabens. We report
here that a major galactolipid component, 1,2-di-O-a-linolenoyl-3O-h-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol (dLGG), can suppress NF-nB and
its downstream inflammatory mediators, NO, iNOS, COX-2, and
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), in vitro. The in vivo cancer prevention
activity of a dLGG-rich extract from C. rabens was also examined
against B16 melanoma growth in C57BL/6J mice.

Cancer Research

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. RAW 264.7 and B16 cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Macrophages were
grown in DMEM (Life Technologies), and B16 cells were grown at 37jC in
RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies), both supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin, in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
Materials. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), LPS, DTT, sodium
nitroferricyanide (SNP), and 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl3-oxide (PTIO) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Celecoxib
(Celebrex) was from Pharmacia. Silica gel (230–400 mesh) and silica gel
60 F254 TLC and RP-18 F254s TLC plates were purchased from Merck. RP-18
silica gel (75C18-OPN) was purchased from Cosmosil. All other chemicals
and solvents were of reagent or high-pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) grade.
Animals. Female C57BL/6J mice and female ICR mice (National
Laboratory Animal Center, Taipei, Taiwan) were given a standard laboratory
diet and distilled water ad libitum and kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle at
22 F 2jC.
Isolation and structure elucidation of dLGG. Approximately 5.0 kg of
fresh whole C. rabens (voucher specimen CB001 in Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of
China) was extracted with methanol at room temperature. Total methanol
extract was partitioned with ethyl acetate to yield the ethyl acetate fraction
(12.5 g), which was separated on a silica gel column with CH2Cl2-methanol
to yield subfractions 1 to 8. Subfraction 8 was further purified on a RP-18
silica gel column eluted with 95% methanol to give a monogalactosyldiacylglycerol-enriched fraction (designated CREa8, 0.8 g). This subfraction, the
most potent inhibitor of NO production in LPS-activated macrophages
among the tested fractions (data not shown), was further fractionated using
semipreparative RP-HPLC (Phenomenex Luna 5 Am, C18 column, 250 
10 mm2). The metabolite profile of CREa8 was characterized and the
content of dLGG was determined using RP-18 HPLC. Pure dLGG (f65.7%
of dry weight of CREa8) had a retention time of 12 min (100% methanol,
3.0 mL/min, A 205 nm). 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectra were recorded on a Brüker ADVANCE 500 AV spectrometer.
dLGG. The characteristics of dLGG [colorless oil; electrospray-mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) m/z 797 [M+Na]+; 1H and 13C NMR data (pyridine-d 5)]
were consistent with previously published data (23). Atmospheric pressure
chemical ionization/mass spectrometry (APCI/MS) was done using a
Thermo Finnigan/LCQ Advantage mass spectrometer, running in positive
ion mode.
Preparation of structural analogues of dLGG. dLGG in H2O was
incubated with h-galactosidase (Sigma Chemical) at 37jC for 2 days, and
the product was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was evaporated to
give 1,2-di-O-a-linolenoyl-sn-glycerol (dLG). dLG: colorless oil; ESI-MS m/z
635 [M+Na]+; the structure of dLG was confirmed using one-dimensional
and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.
dLGG (5 mg) was incubated with Rhizopus arrhizus lipase [1,800 unit/5 mL
in boric acid-borax buffer (pH 7.7); Sigma] at 37jC for 30 min. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 0.1 mL acetic acid and 3 mL ethanol. The solvent
was evaporated and the residue was separated by semipreparative RP-18
HPLC with 90% methanol to obtain 2-O-a-linolenoyl-3-O-h-galactopyranosylsn-glycerol (2LGG; 1.2 mg) and 1-O-a-linolenoyl-3-O-h-galactopyranosyl-snglycerol (1LGG; 0.8 mg). The characteristics of 2LGG and 1LGG [colorless oil;
ESI-MS m/z 797 [M+Na]+; 1H and 13C NMR data (pyridine-d 5)] were consistent
with previously published data (23). Linolenic acid (LA) and stearic acid (SA)
were from Sigma Chemical.
Measurement of NO production and cell viability. RAW 264.7 cells
were treated with compound for 1 h and then incubated for 24 h with or
without LPS. Nitrite levels in cell culture medium were determined using
the Griess reaction (20, 24). Cell viability was examined using the MTTbased assay (25).
Determination of nitrite concentration in plasma. Female ICR mice
were topically treated on their shaven back area of a 2-cm diameter

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

(3.14 cm2/site/mouse) with vehicle control (acetone), SNP (positive control),
or with dLGG or PTIO for 30 min before SNP application. Mouse plasma
samples were analyzed to determine the nitrite content following a
published method (26).
COX-2 activity assays. COX-2 inhibition was measured with the
chemiluminescent COX inhibitor screening assay kit (Cayman Chemical).
Measurement of PGE2 production. PGE2 production was determined
according to the procedure of Chiang et al. (20). Macrophages were
pretreated with aspirin (500 Amol/L, 3 h) to inactivate endogenous COX-1,
washed, and incubated with test compounds for 1 h before further incubation
for 16 h with or without LPS. PGE2 in the culture medium was determined
with ACE competitive enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical).
Reporter gene constructs and luciferase assays. Four chimeric
luciferase reporter genes containing either the full-length 5¶ flanking
promoter region ( 1334/ 1) or the truncations 646/ 1, 320/ 1, and
247/ 1 bp regions of the human COX-2 promoter were constructed in the
pPGL3-Basic vector (Promega) by a published method (20). Another series of
promoter constructs with specific mutations on the consensus sequences
cyclic AMP–responsive element (CRE), NF-IL6, and NF-nB of full-length
COX-2 promoter were also created using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (27). Primer pairs for the mutations had the following sense strand
sequences: CRE ( 193/ 187), 5¶-GAAACAGTCATTAGCTCACATGGGCTTG3¶; NF-IL6 ( 266/ 258), 5¶-CACCGGGCTTAGTGC ATTTTTTTAAGGG-3¶;
NF-nB ( 363/ 343), 5¶-CAGGAGAGTGCCCACTACCCCCTCTGCT-3¶; and
NF-nB ( 587/ 567), 5¶-CGGGAGAGCCC ATTCCCTGCGCCCCCGG-3¶. A
double-mutated COX-2 promoter containing mutations on both NF-nB sites
was also constructed ( for construct maps, see Fig. 2A). pPGL3-Basic vector
was used as a negative control in luciferase assays. COX-2 reporter activity in
arbitrary units was normalized to that for the Renilla luciferase reporter.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. For each reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) analysis, 2 Ag of total RNA isolated using Trizol reagent were
used to synthesize first-strand cDNA using SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The iNOS and COX-2 genes were amplified
and analyzed using specific oligonucleotide primers and PCRs by a
published method (20).
Western blotting. Total cellular proteins and the specific cytosolic and
nuclear proteins were prepared using methods published elsewhere (20, 21).
Protein content was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Protein
was resolved by 5% to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE and subjected to
immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham).
Monoclonal antibodies against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Transduction Laboratories), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; Biogenesis), a-tubulin (Oncogene Science), COX-2 (Cayman
Chemical), phospho-InBa (Ser32), phospho–InB kinase (IKK) a (Ser180)/
IKKh (Ser181; New England Biolabs), iNOS, InBa, IKKa/h, or NF-nB p65
(RelA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used.
Immunoprecipitation and IKK kinase assay. Whole-cell lysates
(300 Ag) of macrophages were precleaned by incubation with 0.25 Ag IgG
and 20 AL protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
for 30 min at 4jC. Supernatants were then collected and incubated with
IKKa/h antibody and protein A/G plus agarose beads at 4jC overnight.
Precipitates were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer and kinase
buffer. IKK kinase activity was assayed by adding 1 Ag glutathione
S-transferase (GST)-InBa fusion protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
200 Amol/L ATP in 20 AL kinase buffer for 30 min at 30jC and then
stopped by Laemmli’s loading buffer and heated at 100jC for 5 min.
Samples were subjected to immunoblotting.
Immunohistochemical study of COX-2 and nitrotyrosine protein
expressions in mouse skin. Female ICR mice were topically treated on
their shaven backs with vehicle (acetone), TPA, or SNP for 4 h or treated
with compound (dLGG, celecoxib, or PTIO) topically for 30 min before
treating with TPA or SNP for 4 h and finally killed by cervical dislocation.
The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin tissues were stained according
to Chiang et al. (20).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) was done with the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit
(Pierce Biotechnology). Four micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated

with biotin end-labeled NF-nB oligonucleotide, 5¶-ATGTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶, for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes
were subjected to 5% to 10% gradient PAGE. Competition assay with
unlabeled oligonucleotide (cold DNA) was done in parallel.
Confocal microscopy study. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in chamber
slides for 1 h and then treated with DMSO or dLGG (75 Ag/mL) for 1 h, with
or without LPS stimulation for an additional 90 min. Cells were fixed,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with Hoechst 33342
(DNA marker), FITC-labeled anti-a-tubulin antibody (cytoplasm marker), or
rabbit anti-p65 antibody visualized with goat anti-rabbit rhodamine red–
labeled secondary antibody for analysis with a Zeiss LSM 510 META
confocal laser scanning microscope.
In vivo inhibition of tumor growth. The chemopreventive effect of the
CREa8 subfraction from C. rabens was evaluated on tumor growth using the
B16 melanoma C57BL/6J mouse system. Six-week-old animals ( four groups
of five mice) were used in this experiment. Group 1 mice (Sham control)
were i.p. injected with 20 AL DMSO every 2 days throughout the
experimental period, except that 100 AL PBS was injected on day 0. Group
4 mice (tumor control) were pretreated with DMSO every 2 days, starting
from day 14, for 2 weeks, inoculated with B16 tumor cells (1  106 cells/
100 AL PBS) s.c. on the abdominal area on day 0, and then injected with
DMSO every 2 days until day 21. Group 2 mice were i.p. pretreated with
CREa8 (10 mg/kg body weight per dose) every 2 days, starting from day 14,
for 2 weeks, s.c. inoculated with B16 tumor cells on day 0, and then
continuously treated with CREa8 (i.p.) every 2 days until day 21. Group 3
mice were similarly pretreated with DMSO every 2 days for 2 weeks, inoculated with B16 tumor cells on day 0, and then treated with cisplatin (i.p.) every
2 days until day 21. The timeline diagram of this experimental design is
shown in Fig. 6A. The test mice were monitored daily, and body weights and
tumor size (average of two dimensions) were recorded every 2 days. At
the end of the experiment (day 21), tumors were excised and weighed.
The mouse CREa8 dose (10 mg/kg body weight) in this study can be
converted to a human equivalent dose (HED) based on body surface area
using the following formula (Food and Drug Administration)3: HED =
animal dose in mg/kg  (animal weight in kg/human weight in kg)0.33,
where the exponent 0.33 is used to account for the difference in body
surface area between mouse and human: a dose of 10 mg/kg in a 20 g
mouse converts to 0.712 mg/kg in a 60 kg human.
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean F SD. Statistical
significance of differences between treatments was determined by ANOVA
with Fisher’s post hoc test. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
dLGG significantly inhibits NO production in vitro and
in vivo. The inhibition of LPS-induced NO production by C. rabens
extracts or purified dLGG was investigated in murine RAW 264.7
macrophages by determination of nitrite level (equivalent to
NO level) in culture medium 24 h after treatment. dLGG significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, 1). The IC50 of dLGG was
f11.4 Ag/mL (14.7 Amol/L). In MTT assays, dLGG (5–20 Ag/mL)
did not have detectable cytotoxicity on test macrophages.
To examine the capability of dLGG to scavenge NO in vivo, we
determined the plasma NO concentration in SNP-insulted mice
with or without pretreatment with dLGG. Figure 1A (2) shows that
the nitrite plasma concentration was significantly increased in
SNP-treated mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice. This
induced increase was suppressed by pretreatment with dLGG or
PTIO, a known NO scavenger, suggesting that dLGG might be a
potent NO scavenger in vivo.

dLGG inhibits transcription of COX-2. The effect of dLGG on
COX-2 gene activity in TPA-treated B16 melanoma cells was
examined. To evaluate whether important cis-acting elements
located in the COX-2 promoter region were affected by TPA or
dLGG treatment, we constructed a series of COX-2 promoterluciferase reporter genes, as listed in Materials and Methods
(Fig. 2A). TPA-induced COX-2 promoter activity in transfected B16
cells was down-regulated by dLGG in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2B). At 50 or 100 Ag/mL, dLGG suppressed full-length COX-2
promoter activities by 20% and 33%, respectively, compared

or celecoxib for 30 min before TPA treatment for 4 h. Immunohistograms were
taken with an Olympus DP-70 camera on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope.

dLGG inhibits iNOS mRNA and protein expression. The
effect of dLGG on iNOS mRNA and protein expression was
examined in LPS-stimulated macrophages. dLGG significantly
down-regulated iNOS mRNA expression, with f56% reduction at
50 Ag/mL (Fig. 1B, 1), suggesting that dLGG modulates iNOS at the
transcriptional level. Immunoblot also showed significant inhibition at the protein level after an 18-h treatment. Little iNOS protein
was detected at 25 to 75 Ag/mL dLGG (Fig. 1B, 2). Thus, the dLGGinduced inhibition of NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages is also mediated through suppression of both transcription
and translation of iNOS.
dLGG inhibits the enzymatic activity and protein expression
of COX-2 and PGE2 production. COX-2 activity in macrophages
was significantly inhibited by dLGG, with a IC50 of 4.15 Ag/mL
(Fig. 1C, 1). The IC50 of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
celecoxib, used as a positive control, was 0.47 Ag/mL. LPS-induced
PGE2 levels in macrophages were significantly reduced (37–58%) by
dLGG at doses between 25 and 75 Ag/mL (Fig. 1C, 2).
We further examined whether dLGG affects COX-2 mRNA and
protein expression using RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Whereas
dLGG only moderately suppressed COX-2 mRNA expression
(f29% inhibition at 75 Ag/mL; data not shown), COX-2 protein
levels were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner.
dLGG (50 Ag/mL) suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 protein synthesis
by f60%, and at 75 Ag/mL, COX-2 protein was barely detectable
(Fig. 1D).

using GST-InBa as substrate. PARP (nuclear protein) and a-tubulin (cytosolic
protein) were used as loading controls.

Figure 5. Inhibitory effects of dLGG on LPS-induced activation of NF-nB
analyzed using EMSA. A, RAW 264.7 cells were preincubated in the presence
or absence of dLGG (75 Ag/mL) for 1 h and subsequently stimulated with LPS
(1 Ag/mL) for 60, 90, 120, and 180 min, respectively. B, cells were treated
with indicated concentrations of dLGG for 1 h followed by treatment with LPS
(1 Ag/mL) for 90 min. Nuclear extracts (4 Ag) were subjected to EMSA with

with cells treated with TPA only (100%). Reference controls aspirin
(45 Ag/mL) and indomethacin (15 Ag/mL) suppressed COX-2
promoter activity by 19% and 28%, respectively.
The full-length COX-2 promoter was found to be highly sensitive
to TPA treatment (1.9-fold increase in luciferase activity) in B16
melanoma cells (Fig. 2C, gray columns). Increasing promoter
truncation decreased the sensitivity to TPA induction, where the
646/ 1 construct showed a 1.45-fold increase in luciferase
activity and the 320/ 1 construct increased only 1.27-fold. The
shortest construct ( 247/ 1) was not responsive to TPA. In the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

presence of 100 Ag/mL dLGG, the TPA-induced luciferase activity
of cells containing 1334/ 1 and 646/ 1 promoter constructs
(Fig. 2C, black columns) was significantly smaller (65–68%; Fig. 2C).
There was no difference between TPA-stimulated cells treated with
dLGG (Fig. 2C, black columns) and the respective background
luciferase activity of all transfected cells (Fig. 2C, white columns),
showing that dLGG was able to fully inhibit any TPA-activated
increases in luciferase activity.
We further examined the contribution of specific cis-acting
element binding sites on the transcription of COX-2 (Fig. 2D). TPA
effectively induced COX-2 promoter-directed luciferase activity in
those constructs containing single or double mutations of the NFIL6 or NF-nB binding sites but not the CRE mutant (Fig. 2D, gray
columns). Importantly, dLGG was able to suppress this TPAinduced COX-2 promoter activity in all mutant promoter
constructs (Fig. 2D, black columns), so that luciferase activity was
the same as in the respective vehicle controls (Fig. 2D, white
columns). These results indicate that the CRE is a critical regulatory
motif for TPA-induced COX-2 transcription, whereas the CRE, NFIL6, and NF-nB binding sites might play an equally important role
in dLGG inhibition of COX-2 promoter activity.
dLGG suppresses TPA-induced COX-2 and nitrotyrosine
protein production in mouse skin. We evaluated the ability of
dLGG to inhibit TPA induction of COX-2 and nitration of proteins
in vivo using immunohistochemical analysis in a mouse skin system.
After treatment with TPA (10 nmol in 200 AL/site) for 4 h, levels of
COX-2 and of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins (immunostained
brown) increased significantly in the epidermis, and these increases
were significantly attenuated by dLGG in a dose-dependent manner.
The inhibitory effect on COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 3A) and on
nitrotyrosine-containing proteins (Fig. 3B) from dLGG at 1 mg in
200 AL/site (6.46 mmol/L) was comparable with that of celecoxib at
10 mg in 200 AL/site (130 mmol/L).
dLGG prevents NF-KB p65 nuclear translocation by suppressing IKBA phosphorylation and degradation. Figure 4A
shows that the LPS-induced phosphorylation of InBa in macrophages was inhibited by dLGG as the phospho-InBa level
decreased when the concentration of dLGG rose. The inhibition
of InBa phosphorylation also prevented InBa degradation: InBa
continued to be detected in the presence of dLGG. The distribution
of NF-nB (p65) in nucleus and cytoplasm was determined using
immunoblotting. A slight increase in nuclear p65 protein (1.5-fold)
was detected when macrophages were treated with a low
concentration of dLGG (5 Ag/mL) compared with LPS alone (1.0).
With higher concentrations of dLGG (25–75 Ag/mL), the level of
nuclear p65 decreased accordingly (Fig. 4B). Cytoplasmic levels of
NF-nB (p65) were not affected by dLGG treatment of LPSstimulated macrophages (Fig. 4B).
The effect of dLGG on NF-nB (p65) nuclear translocation was
also examined by confocal microscopy. Macrophages were treated
with 0.4% DMSO or 1 Ag/mL LPS with or without dLGG (75 Ag/mL)
and stained with fluorescence-labeled antibodies against p65 (red).
To distinguish nucleus from cytosol, cells were also stained with
DNA-specific Hoechst 33342 (blue) and with anti-a-tubulin
antibody (green). In vehicle-treated cells, p65 protein was mainly
found in the cytosol of test cells (Fig. 4C). After stimulation with
LPS, p65 translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus, as seen in
the overlapping blue and red (purple to pink) images in the column
‘‘nucleus/p65.’’ This p65 nuclear translocation was dramatically
inhibited by dLGG, as the stained p65 protein (red) remained in the
cytoplasm (Fig. 4C).

Cancer Chemopreventive Effects of Natural Galactolipid

dLGG inhibits LPS-induced degradation of interleukin-1
receptor-associated kinase-1 and IKKA/B phosphorylation
and IKK kinase activity. The effects of dLGG on levels of
IKKa/h and phospho-IKKa/h, the upstream kinase of InBa in the
NF-nB signaling pathway (28, 29), and the upstream kinase,
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), for activating
IKK complex were examined. dLGG inhibited the LPS-induced
phosphorylation of IKKa/h, whereas IKKa/h levels were little
affected. In addition, dLGG inhibited IRAK-1 degradation in LPSstimulated macrophages (Fig. 4D).

IKK enzymatic activity was also determined to confirm whether
it was correlated to the inhibition of InBa phosphorylation by
dLGG. Immunoprecipitated IKK proteins obtained from control
cells (FLPS/ dLGG) or cells treated with LPS + dLGG were
assayed for phosphorylation of GST-InBa (Fig. 4D). The LPSinduced enzymatic phosphorylation of InBa (phospho-InBa) was
decreased f42% when treated with 75 Ag/mL dLGG. The levels of
immunoprecipitated IKK proteins were not affected by dLGG (data
not shown). This result shows that dLGG abolished InBa
phosphorylation through inhibition of phosphorylation of IKKa/
h and IKK kinase.
dLGG inhibits NF-KB binding to consensus DNA sequence.
We observed in EMSA that stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells with LPS
triggered a consensus nB DNA element binding by NF-nB (Fig. 5A).
dLGG time dependently and dose dependently inhibited
NF-nBDNA binding activity: NF-nBDNA complex levels with
75 Ag/mL dLGG for 60, 90, 120, and 180 min were 0.43, 0.30, 0.16,
and 0.01 times that of LPS alone (1.0), respectively, and 25 and 50
Ag/mL dLGG for 90 min decreased NF-nBDNA complex to 77%
and 23%, respectively, of LPS alone (Fig. 5B). The specific binding of
NF-nB to consensus DNA could be completely prevented by the
addition of excess cold DNA (Fig. 5A and B).
Structure-activity relationship study of dLGG analogues. We
investigated inhibition of NF-nBDNA binding by dLGG and its
structural analogues dLG, 2LGG, 1LGG, LA, and SA by EMSA. The
structure of the six test compounds are shown in Fig. 5C. All
compounds were tested at 100 Amol/L, a concentration that showed
strong effects with dLGG. The inhibitory potencies were dLGG >
dLG > 2LGG > 1LGG > LA > SA (Fig. 5D). dLGG and dLG containing
dilinolenoylglycerol moieties almost completely inhibited NFnBDNA complex formation. 2LGG, 1LGG, and LA with only one
linolenoyl chain were less effective than dLGG and dLG, whereas
there was little or no detectable effect for SA. These results suggest
that the linolenoylglycerol moiety is the essential galactolipid
feature that hinders the formation of the NF-nBDNA complex.
Inhibition of B16 melanoma growth in C57BL/6J mice by
C. rabens extract. The cancer prevention efficacy of the dLGGrich fraction (CREa8) was examined in vivo, using the cancer
chemotherapeutic cisplatin as a reference control. The experimental strategy is presented in the schematic diagram in Fig. 6A.
Body weights of the experimental mice in all four groups all
increased gradually as a function of treatment time (Fig. 6B)
but with no significant differences among the four groups. From
3 days after inoculation, B16 tumor growth was detected in
control mice (group 4; Fig. 6C, o), which grew exponentially over
time (Fig. 6C). Test mice treated with CREa8 (group 2; Fig. 6C,
E) and cisplatin (group 3; Fig. 6C, n) showed a significant delay
(days 3–7) and inhibition of tumor growth after B16 inoculation
(P < 0.05). By day 7, tumors of 0.12 and 0.29 cm average size were
seen in CREa8- and cisplatin-treated mice, respectively, when the
tumor control mice had 0.73 cm tumors. Moreover, the average
tumor sizes at day 17 in groups 2 and 3 mice were markedly
reduced (P < 0.05), at only 76% and 73%, respectively, of the
tumor control (Fig. 6C). For days 18 to 21, all surviving mice in
the tumor control group had tumors larger than the critical size
of 1.5 cm in diameter, at which point test mice were sacrificed
as required by Animal Room regulations. In contrast, at the
same experimental stage, three to five mice in both groups 2 and
3 had tumors <1.5 cm in diameter. Tumors were excised from
all test mice on day 21. CREa8 suppressed B16 melanoma growth
in vivo more than cisplatin (Fig. 6D): the tumor weight to body

weight ratio at day 21 was significantly lower in CREa8 group
(19.7%; P < 0.05) than in cisplatin (25.2%) and tumor control
(31.3%) groups. Although previous studies indicated that oral
galactolipids are degraded and might not to be absorbed intact
by rats (30) and are hydrolyzed by human pancreatic enzymes
and duodenal contents (31), suggesting a low bioavailability of
the unchanged form of dLGG and its derivatives, this study
shows that i.p. administration of dLGG can significantly inhibit
melanoma growth without mortality or body weight loss.

Discussion
The naturally abundant galactolipids are glycoglycerolipids with
two fatty acids esterified to the glycerol sn-1 and sn-2 positions
and one to four galactose units at the sn-3 position. Both natural
and synthetic glycoglycerolipids have specific anti-algal (32),
antiviral (33, 34), antitumor (35, 36), anti-inflammatory (37–40),
and immunosuppressive (41) activities. However, the detailed
molecular mechanisms of these bioactivities remained to be
addressed. We discovered in this study that C. rabens plant
contains a group of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols, differing in
chain length and degree of unsaturation in their fatty acyl groups
(e.g., C16:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3), as determined by liquid
chromatography-APCI/MS (data not shown). We observed that
these compounds dose dependently inhibit NO production in
LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and the major bioactive
component dLGG possesses most significant cancer chemopreventive function.
NO is an attractive therapeutic target because its overproduction
has been associated with septic shock, inflammatory diseases, and
diabetes. Peroxynitrite-induced protein modifications include
protein oxidation or nitration of specific amino acid residues
(42). Unsaturated fatty acids containing bis-allylic protons was
suggested to undergo nitration by NO-derived species via multiple
mechanisms (43) and that nitrated fatty acids are potent antiinflammatory signaling mediators inhibiting LPS-induced secretion
of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages (44). In this light,
dLGG containing two linolenic moieties may thus be a scavenger
for overproduced NO. We have shown here that dLGG effectively
reduced NO in LPS-stimulated macrophages and in the plasma of
SNP (a NO donor)–treated mice (Fig. 1) and that dLGG also
suppressed topical SNP-induced nitroprotein formation in mouse
skin, with similar inhibition to PTIO, a NO scavenger (data not
shown). Additionally, dLGG dose dependently inhibited iNOS
mRNA and protein expression in macrophages. This is the first
demonstration that a galactolipid is a potent NO scavenger in vitro
and in vivo, and the reduction in NO is also partly mediated by
gene and protein down-regulation of iNOS (Fig. 1).
COX-2 can foster cancer development by enhancing cellular
proliferation, rendering cells resistant to apoptosis and promoting
angiogenesis. The increased prostaglandin production in different
types of cancers (e.g., colon, breast, and lung) is associated with
increased COX-2 expression (14). In this study, inhibition of PGE2
production by dLGG in macrophages was correlated with the
attenuation of COX-2 transcriptional, translational, and enzymatic
activities (Figs. 1 and 2). COX-2 is an immediate early response
gene; its expression is regulated at cis-acting sites by the binding of
transcription factors to the COX-2 promoter via transactivation of
a regulatory signal. Our COX-2 mutant studies reveal that although
the CRE is the most important regulatory factor for TPA induction
of COX-2 activity in B16 cells, CRE, NF-IL6, and NF-nB binding

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

motifs all contributed to dLGG suppression of COX-2 promoter
activity (Fig. 2D). TPA-induced overexpression of COX-2 protein
and protein nitration were effectively suppressed by dLGG, with an
efficacy comparable with celecoxib (Fig. 3A and B). These data are
the first demonstration that a galactolipid is a potent COX-2
inhibitor in vitro and in vivo.
The translocation of NF-nB to the nucleus is dependent on the
phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolytic degradation of
InB. The nuclear NF-nB can then transactivate several immuneor inflammatory-related genes (19). We showed that the inhibitory
effect of dLGG on NF-nB nuclear translocation was due to the
inhibition of LPS-induced degradation of IRAK-1 and prevention
of phosphorylation and degradation of InB through inhibition of
the phosphorylation of IKKa/h and IKK kinase activities (Fig. 4).
Our result shows that nuclear NF-nB DNA binding was also
significantly inhibited by dLGG in LPS-stimulated macrophages.
Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that galactolipids
containing dilinolenoylglycerol moieties (dLGG and dLG) were the
most significant inhibitors of NF-nB DNA binding. In addition, the
unsaturated LA (C18:3) was more effective than SA (C18:0; Fig. 5).
Similar inhibitory activity of dLGG analogues on NO production
was also observed (data not shown). Therefore, we suggest that
the linolenoylglycerol element of dLGG plays a critical role in
preventing NF-nB transactivation and NO production in LPSstimulated macrophages. IRAK-1 was reported to be one of the very
upstream molecules activated by an adaptor protein, myeloid
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), in the MyD88dependent pathway, which leads to the translocation of NF-nB into
nucleus and this in turn can regulate the expression of many genes
related to proinflammatory mediators (45). We have also observed
that dLGG can dose dependently suppress the binding of FITClabeled LPS to the test macrophages (data not shown). Taken
together, our results show that dLGG attenuates the activity of NFnB and its downstream inflammatory mediators, NO, iNOS, COX-2,
and PGE2, in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS, probably due to
the suppression of LPS binding to LPS receptors on the cells and the
down-regulation of the MyD88-dependent pathway.
Botanical preparations have been used for treatment and
prevention of various human diseases throughout history. However,
as the active ingredients in plants and their mechanisms of action
are usually poorly understood, scientific study of the bioefficacy
and pharmacologic effects of medicinal plants is urgently needed.
This report provides new insight into the molecular mechanism(s)
underlying the anti-inflammatory bioactivities of a natural
galactolipid dLGG from C. rabens. The anti-inflammatory effects
of this galactolipid might be directly responsible for its significant
cancer chemopreventive activity in vivo: the growth of B16
melanoma in C57BL/6J mice was inhibited by a galactolipid-rich
fraction of C. rabens, with similar efficacy to current chemotherapeutic agents.
