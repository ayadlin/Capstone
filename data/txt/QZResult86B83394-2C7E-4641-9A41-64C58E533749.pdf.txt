ABSTRACT
Regorafenib is an inhibitor of multiple protein kinases which exerts antitumor
and antimetastatic activities in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). SH2 domaincontaining phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) is reported to have tumor suppressive potential
because it acts as a negative regulator of p-STAT3Tyr705 signaling. However, little
is known about the mechanism regarding regorafenib affects SHP-1 tyrosine
phosphatase activity and leads to apoptosis and tumor suppression in CRC. Here,
we found that regorafenib triggered apoptotic cell death and significantly enhanced
SHP-1 activity, which dramatically decreased the phosphorylated form of STAT3 at
Tyr705 (p-STAT3Tyr705). Importantly, regorafenib augmented SHP-1 activity by direct
disruption of the association between N-SH2 and catalytic PTP domain of SHP-1.
Deletion of the N-SH2 domain (dN1) or point mutation (D61A) of SHP-1 blocked
the effect of regorafenib-induced SHP-1 activity, growth inhibition and a decrease
of p-STAT3Tyr705 expression, suggesting that regorafenib triggers a conformational
change in SHP-1 by relieving its autoinhibition. In vivo assay showed that regorafenib
significantly inhibited xenograft growth and decreased p-STAT3Tyr705 expression but
induced higher SHP-1 activity. Collectively, regorafenib is a novel SHP-1 agonist
exerts superior anti-tumor effects by enhancing SHP-1 activity that directly targets
p-STAT3Tyr705. Small molecule-enhancement of SHP-1 activity may be a promising
therapeutic approach for CRC treatment.

inhibitor of both intracellular and membrane-bound

the signal pathways related to tumor angiogenesis,

is the first study to report that regorafenib is a novel SHP1 agonist that directly impairs the interaction between the
N-SH2 domain and the PTP catalytic domain of SHP-1,
and further relieves the autoinhibition of SHP-1. Our study
reveals the novel molecular mechanism through which
regorafenib triggers an SHP-1 tumor suppressive pathway
to exert superior anti-tumor effects by promoting SHP1 tyrosine phosphatase activity that targets the oncogenic
expression of p-STAT3 Tyr 705 directly.

benefits in metastatic CRC patients and subsequently
became the first approved therapeutic drug for the disease
[3]. Regorafenib has been reported to not only exert
antitumor effects by inhibiting cell proliferation and
markedly suppressing xenograft growth, but also display
antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activities in CRC [4].
Regorafenib (Fluoro-sorafenib) is structurally
very similar to sorafenib, but regorafenib contains a
fluorine atom rather than a hydrogen atom on the central
aromatic ring. Sorafenib is also a multi-kinase growth
inhibitor and is the first FDA-approved oral therapy for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [5]. Recently, it has
been demonstrated that sorafenib and its derivatives
directly enhance the activity of Src homology region 2
(SH2) domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) and
which specifically decreases the phosphorylated form of
STAT3 at Tyr705 (p-STAT3Tyr705) and eventually leads
to cancer apoptosis and suppressed tumorigenicity [6,
7]. SHP-1 is first identified in hematopoietic cells and is
predominantly expressed in hematopoietic and epithelial
cells [8-10]. SHP-1 belongs to a family of non-receptor
protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which involved
in hematopoietic signaling processes and has also been
reported to function as a tumor suppressor during tumor
progression [11-14]. SHP-1 contains two SH2 domains,
a catalytic PTP domain and a C-terminal tail [11].
Notably, its phosphatase activity is highly dependent on
its structural variability. For example, the closed-form
chemical structure of SHP-1 is assembled by the N-SH2
domain and protrudes into the catalytic domain to directly
block the entrance into the active site, and the highly
mobile C-SH2 domain is believed to act as an antenna to
search for the phosphopeptide activator [15-19]. Other
reports also indicate that the PTP catalytic domain is
activated due to the flexibility of the WPD loop, which
contains the active-site residue, Asp421 [11, 15, 16, 20].
Our recent work has mechanistically demonstrated
that sorafenib-enhanced SHP-1 activity is due to the
docking potential of sorafenib, which directly disrupts
the association between N-SH2 and catalytic PTP domain
of SHP-1 and further relieves SHP-1’s autoinhibition
[6, 7]. Importantly, our previous studies have clearly
demonstrated that SHP-1 is a negative regulator of
p-STAT3Tyr705 [6, 21-24] that is highly expressed in cancer
cells and is crucial for growth, survival, and metastasis
of cancer cells during cancer progression. Therefore,
we clarify whether the sorafenib analog regorafenib
(Fluoro-sorafenib) acts as a direct enhancer of SHP-1 by
which enhanced SHP-1 activity directly downregulates
p-STAT3Tyr705 and eventually contributes to apoptosis
in CRC. Understanding the mechanism of the tumor
suppression pathway activated by regorafenib may provide
a new therapeutic strategy through which to abolish
STAT3 oncogenic signaling. This study is aim to gain
further insight into the molecular mechanisms through
which regorafenib induces apoptosis in vitro as well

RESULTS
Regorafenib showed superior growth inhibition
and significantly induced apoptosis in colon
cancer cell lines
First, we investigated the biological effect of
regorafenib on growth inhibition in a panel of 4 human
CRC cell lines (Hct-15, DLD1, HT-29 and Hct-116). Two
days after treatment with regorafenib at doses of more than
5 µM, cell viability was dramatically decreased (Figure
1A) and apoptosis was significantly induced (Figure 1B)
in these CRC cell lines. Moreover, 24-hours after cells
were treated with regorafenib, marked apoptotic cell
death and increased specific caspase-3 activity occurred
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C). These findings
suggest that regorafenib exerts an anti-cancer effect by
inducing apoptotic cell death in CRC cells.

Downregulated expression of p-STAT3Tyr705 was
associated with the apoptotic effect of regorafenib
The phosphorylated form of STAT3 at Tyr705
(p-STAT3Tyr705) has been reported to be constitutively
expressed in CRC and be involved in proliferative
regulation [25]. Therefore, we next examined whether
p-STAT3Tyr705 expression is involved in the apoptosis
induced by regorafenib. Treatment of CRC cells with
regorafenib for 24 hours gradually decreased the
expression of p-STAT3Tyr705 and its related downstream
survival targets cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2A). We also found that Hct-15 and
DLD1 cells treated with regorafenib at 5µM gradually
suppressed activated expression of p-STAT3Tyr705 but
markedly increased apoptotic indicators the expressions of
cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-9 in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 2B). Notably, overexpression of STAT3
obviously restored p-STAT3Tyr705 expression and inhibited
apoptosis induced by treatment with regorafenib for 24
hours (Figure 2C), suggesting that regorafenib-triggered
apoptosis is mediated by STAT3 inactivation.

Regorafenib increased SHP-1 activity directly

augmented SHP-1 activity by incubation with cell-free
purified SHP-1 protein (Figure 3C). Taken together, these
results suggest that regorafenib is a novel SHP-1 agonist
that increases SHP-1 activity in CRC. In order to know
whether the regorafenib-induced growth inhibition is
depended on SHP-1, we hence used SHP-1 phosphatasespecific inhibitor (PTPIII) to inhibit SHP-1 activity and
found that regorafenib-induced growth inhibition in CRC
cell lines were significantly rescued by treatment with
SHP-1 inhibitor (Figure 3D). In addition, siRNA-mediated
SHP-1 depletion in CRC cell lines also significantly
reduced the effects of regorafenib on growth inhibition
and p-STAT3Tyr705 expression (Figure 3E). These results
suggest that SHP-1 was crucial for regorafenib-induced
growth inhibition in CRC cells.

Ample evidence has demonstrated that the tyrosine
phosphatase activity of SHP-1 significantly downregulates
p-STAT3Tyr705 expression and induces apoptosis in different
cancer types [6, 21-25]. Therefore, we evaluated whether
SHP-1 activity is crucial for the dephosphorylation
of STAT3 at Tyr705 induced by regorafenib. We found
that regorafenib significantly increased SHP-1 tyrosine
phosphatase activity in Hct-116 and DLD1 cells (Figure
3A). In addition, regorafenib-enhanced SHP-1 activity
was observed in SHP-1-containing IP extract at 5 µM
(Figure 3B). Notably, we further verified regorafenib

phosphatase activity by directly impairing the
interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP catalytic
domains of SHP-1
Next, in order to understand the mechanism through
which regorafenib regulates SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase
activity, we provide a molecular rationale for the docking
model that regorafenib docks into the interface of N-SH2
and PTP domain which is crucial for SHP-1 activation.
The small-molecule docking site (by CDOCKER), which
is labeled by a transparent red circle, is around the N-SH2
domain and C-terminal residues. Regorafenib forms
a hydrogen bond (shown in green dashed lines) with
Gln527. The -CDOCKER interaction energy (CDOCKER
docking score) is 40.38. (Figure 4A, left). Therefore, we
subsequently transfected Hct-116 cells with wild-type
or SHP-1 mutants dN1 and D61A, and further analyzed
SHP-1 activity as well as the susceptibility to STAT3
dephosphorylation at Tyr705. We focused particularly on
the intramolecular inhibition (salt bridge) between Asp61
(D61) within the N-SH2 domain, and Lys362 contained in
the PTP catalytic domain of SHP-1 (Figure 4A, right). The
D61A mutant mimics the open conformation of SHP-1 and
dN1 is the deletion of N-SH2 domain of SHP-1, and both
serve as constitutive activators.
Indeed, dN1 and D61A mutant SHP-1overexpressing cells showed the relatively higher
SHP-1 activity (Figure 4B) but displayed the relatively
lower viability (Figure 4D) and a decrease of p-STAT3
expression, compared with wild-type SHP-1-expressed
cells (Figure 4C, left). Notably, regorafenib significantly
enhanced SHP-1 activity in wild-type SHP-1-transfected
cells, but not in D61A or dN1 mutant SHP-1-transfected
cells (Figure 4B), suggesting that regorafenib increases
SHP-1 activity by direct disruption of the association
between the N-SH2 domain and the PTP catalytic domain.
We also observed drastically downregulated p-STAT3Tyr705
expression and significant inhibition of growth in

regorafenib-treated wild-type SHP-1 expressing cells but
no significant p-STAT3Tyr705 expression either in D61A or
dN1 mutant SHP-1-transfected cells following treatment
with regorafenib (Figure 4C, right and D). Together these
results demonstrate that regorafenib affects SHP-1 activity
by its potential to dock to the inhibitory N-SH2 domain
and the catalytic PTP domain of SHP-1. Regorafenib,
therefore, appears to be a novel SHP-1 agonist that not
only directly relieves the autoinhibition of SHP-1 but
further specifically increases susceptibility to STAT3
dephosphorylation at Tyr705 by regorafenib-enhanced
SHP-1 activity.

treated tumors were heavier than regorafenib-treated
tumors (Figure 5B), which suggests that regorafenib
had a suppressive effect on tumor formation. Notably,
regorafenib-treated tumors showed a relatively lower
expression of p-STAT3Tyr705 (Figure 5C) but a significantly
higher SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity, compared
with vehicle-treated tumors (Figure 5D), suggesting that
suppression of tumorigenicity by regorafenib in vivo is
due to its enhancement of SHP-1 activity that directly
targeted p-STAT3Tyr705 expression. Immunohistochemistry
staining of SHP-1 and p-STAT3Tyr705 in two CRC patients
also showed that the clinical CRC patient#1 with strong
positive expression of p-STAT3Tyr705 had weak positive
expression of SHP-1. In contrast, patient#2 with weak
positive expression of p-STAT3Tyr705 had strong positive
expression of SHP-1 (Figure 5E). However, whether there
is an inverse correlation between SHP-1 and p-STAT3Tyr705
in CRC samples will need to perform the experiments on a
larger number of patients. Therefore, further examination
of the role of SHP-1 on a large number of CRC tissues
is required. Collectively, our findings establish a novel
role of regorafenib as an agonist of SHP-1 tyrosine
phosphatase activity by direct disruption of the association
between N-SH2 and catalytic PTP domain of SHP-1 and
then downregulating the expressions of p-STAT3Tyr705 and
its related survival factors such as Cyclin D1 and Mcl-1
,thereby, triggering apoptotic induction in CRC (Figure 6).

The suppressive effect of regorafenib on tumor
formation in vivo
To investigate whether regorafenib has a therapeutic
effect on tumorigenesis in vivo, we subcutaneously injected
Hct-116 cells (2 × 106) into the posterior flank of nude
mice and then treated them with or without regorafenib
at 10 mg/kg/day when the tumors became palpable and
grew rapidly. The tumor size of regorafenib- and vehicletreated tumors were measured on days 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18,
21, 24 and 25 and it was found that regorafenib-treated
tumors grew slowly compared with vehicle-treated tumors
(Figure 5A). On day 25 after treatment with regorafenib,
primary tumors were excised and measured. Vehicle-

activity, and induced apoptosis and tumor suppression in
CRC.
SHP-1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic
and epithelial cells [8-10] and its phosphatase activity is
highly dependent on its structural variability, as evidenced
by its open- and closed-form chemical structure [15-19].
The crystal structure of ligand-free SHP-1 engages in
auto-inhibition due to intramolecular interaction between
its N-SH2 domain and catalytic PTP domain. Notably,
the specific residue, D61, forms a critical salt bridge
resulting in a “closed” catalytic PTP domain. Our study
showed that regorafenib-enhanced SHP-1 activity was
significantly observed in CRC cells and was also seen in
SHP-1 containing IP extract at 5 µM. Cell-free purified
SHP-1 protein further verified the significantly increased
SHP-1 activity directly enhanced by regorafenib.
Importantly, we also observed the significant induction
of SHP-1 activity by overexpressing wild-type SHP-1
in CRC cells. This induction was not seen in D61A and
dN1 mutant SHP-1-expressing CRC cells, indicating
that regorafenib-enhanced SHP-1 activity is due to its
docking potential between the inhibitory N-SH2 domain
and catalytic PTP domain of SHP-1, which directly
relieves the autoinhibition of SHP-1. We also observed
regorafenib dramatically downregulated p-STAT3Tyr705
expression and significant suppression of growth in wildtype SHP-1-expressing CRC cells, but not in D61A and
dN1 mutant SHP-1-expressing CRC cells, suggesting that
the increased susceptibility to STAT3 dephosphorylation
at Tyr705 is due to regorafenib-enhanced SHP-1 activity.
In this study, we validated the role of SHP-1 on the
in vitro effect of regorafenib by using SHP-1 phosphatase-

the molecular mechanisms through which regorafenib
potently induces apoptosis in CRC cells in vitro and

first evidence demonstrating that regorafenib is a novel
enhancer of SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity, which
dramatically decreases p-STAT3Tyr705 expression. Ample
evidence suggests that SHP-1 functions as a tumor
suppressor that directly targets the oncogenic expression
of p-STAT3Tyr705 that is crucial for the tumor survival and
cellular proliferation [6, 21-24]. Our study demonstrated
for the first time that regorafenib activated an SHP-1

the role of regorafenib as a novel SHP-1 agonist in a
preclinical model of CRC. We also discovered that SHP-1
tumor suppression pathway-mediated apoptosis and antitumor activity was significantly triggered by regorafenib.
Our studies suggest that SHP-1 may be a useful biomarker
for predicting the efficacy of regorafenib treatment in CRC
patients.

CA). Apoptotic cell death was determined using the Cell
Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Sciences,
Germany). Caspase-3 activity was measured using the
Caspase 3 Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambrige, MA). Both of the
assays were carried out according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cell proliferation assay
After treatment with regorafenib at the indicated
doses for 2 days, cell proliferation was measured using
a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were counted and seeded in
96-well plates, and then incubated at 37°C in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere. Twenty microliters of MTT reagent
(5 mg/ml, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was added to
each well at the end of incubation, then 4 hours later the
medium was discarded and 150 µl dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) was added to each well to dissolve the purple
crystal. Then the absorbance at 490 nm was measured.
Experiments were performed three times in duplicate.

Apoptosis detection by sub-G1 analysis

METHODS

For the analysis of apoptosis, both floating and
attached cells were collected and centrifuged before
being washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and then fixed in 70% cold ethanol overnight at -20°C.
Propidium iodide staining was performed after incubation
of the cells with 50 µg/ml propidium iodide and 20 µg/
ml RNase A in the dark at room temperature for 30
min, which were then analyzed by flow cytometry (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Cell culture
Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines Hct-15, DLD1,
HT-29 and Hct-116 were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells were then
incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Western blotting

Reagents, plasmid and test kit

Whole-cell lysates were resolved by sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE). Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and
incubated with the primary antibody, and then incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies. Specific proteins were detected using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent. The primary
antibodies used for western blotting, including cyclin D1
and PARP were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(San Diego, CA); p-STAT3, STAT3, Mcl-1 and Caspase-9
were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); SHP1 and β-actin were purchased from Abcam (Cambrige,
MA).

Regorafenib was kindly provided by Bayer
HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. For cell-based studies,
regorafenib at various concentrations was dissolved in
DMSO and then added to the cells maintained in RPMI
1640 medium with or without FBS. SHP-1 inhibitor
(PTP III) was purchased from Calbiochem. Smart-pool
siRNA, including control (D-001810-10), SHP-1 (PTPN6,
L-009778-00-0005) were all purchased from Dharmacon
Inc. (Chicago, IL). Plasmids of human wild-type STAT3
and SHP-1 (PTPN6) were encoded by pCMV6 vector
with myc-tag. For mutant-type SHP-1 expression, we
generated two plasmids, designated dN1 and D61A,
which truncated the N-SH2/PTP domain and changed
aspartic acid at 61 to an alanine residue, respectively. Both
plasmids were cloned into pCMV6-Entry vector. These
plasmids or siRNA were subsequently transfected into
cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogene,

Xenograft tumor growth
We subcutaneously injected Hct-116 cells (2 × 106)
into the posterior flank of nude mice and then treated them
with or without regorafenib at 10 mg/kg/day when the
tumors became palpable and grew rapidly. The tumor size
of regorafenib- or vehicle-treated tumors was measured
on days 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 24 and 25. On day 25 the
tumor weights were measured after tumor excision.

Immunohistochemistry
Specimens fixed in 10% buffered formalin
were embedded in paraffin and then sectioned.
Immunohistochemical analysis of the paraffin sections
was done using primary antibody for SHP-1 and p-STAT3;
the sections were then incubated with anti-mouse/rabbit
immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody. The signal was detected using a kit
(Aminoethyl Carbazole Substrate Kit; Zymed Laboratories
Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA). The sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin.
