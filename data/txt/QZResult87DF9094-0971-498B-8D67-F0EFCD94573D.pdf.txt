Abstract
Elucidating mechanisms of chemoresistance is critical to
improve cancer therapy, especially for the treatment of pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Genome-wide association studies have suggested the less studied gene HEAT repeat-containing
protein 1 (HEATR1) as a possible determinant of cellular sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we
assessed this hypothesized link in PDAC, where HEATR1 expression is downregulated signiﬁcantly. HEATR1 silencing in PDAC
cells increased resistance to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutics, where this effect was associated with increased AKT
kinase phosphorylation at the Thr308 regulatory site. Mechanistically, HEATR1 enhanced cell responsiveness to gemcitabine
by acting as a scaffold to facilitate interactions between AKT and

the protein phosphatase PP2A, thereby promoting Thr308
dephosphorylation. Consistent with these ﬁndings, treatment
with the AKT inhibitor triciribine sensitized HEATR1-depleted
PDAC cells to gemcitabine, suggesting that this therapeutic combination may overcome gemcitabine resistance in patients
with low HEATR1 expression. Clinically, we found that HEATR1
downregulation in PDAC patients was associated with increased
AKT phosphorylation, poor response to tumor resection plus
gemcitabine standard-of-care treatment, and shorter overall survival. Collectively, our ﬁndings establish HEATR1 as a novel
regulator of AKT and a candidate predictive and prognostic
indicator of drug responsiveness and outcome in PDAC patients.

Introduction

functions through phosphorylating substrates. Akt directly phosphorylates BAD, preventing it from inhibiting prosurvival Bcl-2
family members (5, 6). Akt regulates glucose metabolism through
phosphorylating and inactivating GSK3 (7). In addition, Akt negatively regulates FOXO and p53 and blocks the transcription of
BIM, Puma, and Noxa (8, 9). Furthermore, Akt promotes protein
synthesis and cell growth through activation of mTOR (10).
Akt activity is tightly controlled at multiple levels. PI3K, a
critical upstream kinase of Akt signaling, is activated by growth
factors, cytokine, and others (2) and converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits Akt to plasma membrane, where
Akt is phosphorylated at Thr308 (11). Ubiquitination of Akt by
TRAF6 and Skp2-SCF E3 ligase is required for the recruitment of
Akt to plasma membrane (12, 13). Full Akt activity requires
phosphorylation of both Thr308 and Ser473 mediated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1; ref. 14) and mTOR
complex 2 (mTORC2; ref. 15), respectively. On the other hand,
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A; refs. 16–18) and PH domain
leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP; refs. 19, 20)
dephosphorylate AktThr308 and Ser473, respectively. FKBP51
promotes dephosphorylation of Akt Ser473 through acting as a
scaffolding protein for Akt and PHLPP (21). However, how Akt is
targeted to PP2A is not clear.
HEAT repeat-containing protein 1 (HEATR1) contains HEAT
repeats, which was initially found in a diverse family of proteins
including huntingtin, elongation factor-3, and the PR65/A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (22). Except for a couple of reports
suggesting that HEATR1 may regulate rRNA synthesis and CTLs in

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal
malignancy. The prognosis of patients with PDAC is dismal with a
5-year survival of less than 5%. Antitumor drugs and radiotherapy
are current treatment options for PDAC; however, drug resistance
frequently occurs. Thus, understanding molecular mechanisms
contributing to the resistance of PDAC to chemotherapy will
provide clues for new targeted therapies.
Akt is a central module to regulate cell proliferation and survival,
angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism (1, 2). Aberrant Akt activation is associated with diverse pathophysiologic states including
cancers and chemoresistance (3, 4). Akt controls these cellular

HEATR1 Negatively Regulates Akt

patients with glioma (23, 24), the cellular function of HEATR1
remains largely unknown. Here, we report that HEATR1 regulates
cancer cell response to multiple classes of chemotherapeutic
drugs. Mechanistically, HEATR1 affects survival of pancreatic
cancer cells to chemotherapy by affecting Akt activity. We demonstrate that HEATR1 functions as a scaffold protein to regulate
Akt phosphorylation by PP2A. Furthermore, our study
identiﬁes HEATR1 as a potential prognostic marker of pancreatic
cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and plasmids
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines SU86.86, ASPC-1, and
PANC-1 were purchased from ATCC in 2014 and the identities
of all cell lines were conﬁrmed by the medical genome facility at
Mayo Clinic Center (Rochester, MN) using short tandem repeat
proﬁling upon receipt. The cell lines were maintained in
RPMI1640 with 10% FBS. HEATR1 cDNA was purchased from
Thermo Scientiﬁc and full length and mutants were subcloned
into pIRES-EGFP. PP2A-Aa, B55a, B56b, and Ca were purchased
from Addgene and subcloned into HA-pcmv and pGex4T-1.
HEATR1 siRNA and shRNA were from Dharmacon and Sigma,
respectively.
MTS assay
Gemcitabine was from Eli Lilly and Company. Paclitaxel, SN38, mitomycin C (MMC), oxaliplatin, and etoposide were from
Sigma-Aldrich. Triciribine (TCN) was from EMD Biosciences. Ctrl
or HEATR1 siRNA or shRNA were transfected, and the growthinhibitory effect was performed as described previously (21).
Tumor xenograft study
Female athymic nu/nu mice were obtained from the NCI
(Bethesda, MD). Experiments were performed under the approval
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Mayo
Clinic (Rochester, MN). PANC-1 cells stably expressing Ctrl and
HEATR1 shRNA were injected subcutaneously in mouse ﬂanks
(106 cells/mouse ﬂank). Tumor volumes were measured every 3
days. When tumors reached 100 mm3, mice were randomized to
four groups (n ¼ 8): vehicle; TCN (0.5 mg/kg/day), administered
intraperitoneally once daily; gemcitabine (50 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally every 3 days; and a combination of two
treatments. After sacriﬁcing the mice, tumors were surgically
removed and weighted.
Patients' specimens and follow-up
From 2007 to 2012, the same surgical team in our institute
performed curative resection for pancreatic cancer on 100 consecutive patients, deﬁned as macroscopically complete removal of
the tumor. All patients were observed until February 2014. Overall
survival (OS) was deﬁned as the interval between the date of
surgery and death. None of the patients received any preoperative
anticancer treatment, and all of them received standardized
postoperative chemotherapeutic regimen of gemcitabine. Of
the clinicopathologic features, tumor stage was determined
according to the 2002 International Union against Cancer
tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation system. Tumor differentiation was graded by the Edmondson grading system. The
study was approved by the Zhongshan Hospital Research Ethics
Committee.

Immunohistochemical staining and image analysis
Tissue microarray was constructed following standard tissue
array–producing protocols as described previously (25). Primary
antibodies were both rabbit polyclonal antibody for HEATR1 and
pAkt308, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody.
High-sensitivity diaminobenzidine chromogenic substrate system was used for colorimetric visualization. The density of positive staining was measured by a computerized image system
including Leica-CCD camera connected to a Leica-DM-IRE2
microscope. Under high-power magniﬁcation, photographs of
representative ﬁelds were captured by the Leica QWin Plus v3
software. HEATR1 density was counted by Image-Pro Plus v6.2
software.
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean  SD and analyzed using t-test or
ANOVA. Signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05. SPSS 16.0 for Windows
(SPSS Inc) was used for survival analysis in patients. Pearson c2
test or Fisher exact test was used to compare qualitative variables,
and quantitative variables were analyzed by t test or Pearson
correlation test. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to determine the
survival. Log-rank test was used to compare survival of patients
between subgroups, and the Cox regression model was used to
perform multivariate analysis.
Other methods and information are available in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
HEATR regulates response of pancreatic cancer cells to
chemotherapy
We have performed several genome-wide association studies to
identify genes whose expression associates with sensitivity to
chemotherapy. Interestingly, we found that HEATR1 gene,
although not among the top hits in these studies, associates with
response to several drugs, including gemcitabine and 1-b-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine(26). We depleted HEATR1 with siRNA in
cells and treated cells with gemcitabine. Downregulation
of HEATR1 resulted in increased resistance to gemcitabine
(Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with two HEATR1-speciﬁc
shRNAs (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Next, multiple
classes of chemotherapeutic drugs including oxaliplatin, SN-38,
MMC, paclitaxel, camptothecin, and etopside were used to treat
cells. Similarly, cells with HEATR1 knockdown were signiﬁcantly
resistant to these drugs (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1B).
These results establish an important role of HEATR1 in regulating
chemotherapeutic response to different antitumor agents.
HEATR1 regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 by
promoting Akt–PP2AB56b interaction
As HEATR1 affects cellular response to a broad range of chemotherapeutic agents, it is likely that HEATR1 affects a common
pathway such as apoptosis. Gemcitabine induced apparently
stronger apoptosis in control cells than in cells transfected with
HEATR1 shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Next, we investigated
how HEATR1 affects chemotherapeutic response by probing
several pathways regulating cell death. We found that downregulation of HEATR1 led to an increased phosphorylation of
Akt at Thr308, but not at Ser473 (Fig. 2A and B). These results
suggest that depletion of HEATR1 affects steady-state Akt phosphorylation, which is consistent with an increase in cell growth

(Supplementary Fig. S2B). We next examined how HEATR1
affects acute Akt activation. Cells were starved and stimulated
with serum. Phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 and the Akt substrate
GSK-3b was signiﬁcantly increased in cells transfected with
HEATR1 siRNA (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, overexpression of
HEATR1 decreased phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308, but not
Ser473 (Fig. 2D). We also found that HEATR1 interacted with Akt
in cells (Fig. 2E and F). The intracellular colocalization of HEATR1
and Akt was detected by confocal microscopy. Akt and HEATR1
colocalize in the cytoplasm and occasionally at the cell membrane
in most cells examined (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
As HEATR1 speciﬁcally regulates Thr308, it is likely that
HEATR1 regulates signaling events that directly control Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. Thr308 of Akt is phosphorylated by PDK1

574 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

and dephosphorylated by PP2A (16, 18, 27). No apparent difference of PDK1 phosphorylation was observed in control and
HEATR1-depleted cells (Fig. 2C). HEATR1 neither interacted with
PDK1 nor affected the interaction between Akt and PDK1 (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C), indicating that HEATR1 regulates
Akt activity independent of PDK1. Next, we examined whether
HEATR1 regulates Thr308 phosphorylation through PP2A. Treatment of PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid signiﬁcantly increased
Akt phosphorylation at Thr308, and HEATR1 knockdown did
not further increase Thr308 phosphorylation (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). As shown in Fig. 2G, HEATR1 interacted with PP2A
scaffolding subunit Aa, catalytic subunit Ca, and regulatory
subunits B55a and B56b, which have been reported to speciﬁcally
target Akt Thr308 dephosphorylation (16–18, 27). Furthermore,

of HEATR1 is important for the regulation of Akt phosphorylation, we overexpressed wild-type (WT) and mutants in cells
(Fig. 3D). WT decreased Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and
cellular sensitivity to gemcitabine, while HEATR1 mutants that

Akt1 and GST–B56b (Fig. 2K). These results suggest that HEATR1
promotes the interaction between Akt and PP2A, facilitating the
dephosphorylation of Akt at Thr308.

HEATR1 with B56b, whereas the middle region (420–1420) was
responsible for the binding of HEATR1 with Akt (Fig. 3B and C).
These results suggest that HEATR1 binds Akt and B56b using

inhibitor TCN, binds to PH domain of Akt and prevents its
recruitment to cell membrane, where Akt is phosphorylated by

However, TCN sensitized cells depleted of HEATR1 to gemcitabine (Fig. 4A and B, Supplementary Fig. S4B–S4E). We next tested

tumors with low HEATR1 level in vivo. Xenograft experiments
showed that downregulation of HEATR1 promoted tumor growth
and resistance to gemcitabine (Fig. 4C–E and Supplementary
Fig. S4F). TCN treatment resensitized response of these cells to
gemcitabine. This is consistent with in vitro results using pancreatic
cancer cell lines and indicates that HEATR1 affects chemosensitivity through regulating Akt activity in vivo.
Association of HEATR1 expression in pancreatic cancer patients
with survival and response to chemotherapy
We next used clinical samples to examine the role of HEATR1 in
clinical response. Among 100 patients with PDAC, 76 patients
died and 24 patients survived with the median survival time of 18
months. Pathologic analysis using PDAC and peritumoral tissues
from patients was performed. Statistical analysis revealed that the
expression of HEATR1 was signiﬁcantly lower in pancreatic tumor
tissue than in normal pancreatic tissues (Fig. 5A). The staining of
Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 was signiﬁcantly higher in pancreatic tumor tissue than in normal pancreatic tissue (Fig. 5A).

578 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

Furthermore, low HEATR1 protein levels correlate with increased
Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in representative pancreatic cancer
samples (Fig. 5B). We next evaluated whether HEATR1 expression
was associated with the response of patients to standardized
gemcitabine chemotherapy. As shown in Fig. 5C and D, Supplementary Fig. S5, and Supplementary Table S1, PDAC patients with
high HEATR1 or low AktT308 expression in tumors had a significant improvement in OS. Thus, determination of HEATR1
expression in PDAC tissues may be useful as an independent
predictor for gemcitabine response. On the basis of IOD value, we
observed a negative correlation between HEATR1 expression and
Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in tumor tissues (Fig. 5E). Meanwhile, we observed a signiﬁcant correlation between the Akt308
phosphorylation and TNM staging, and lymph node metastasis,
but we did not ﬁnd the correlation between HEATR1 expression
and clinical pathologic feature (Supplementary Table S2). From
multivariate survival analysis, HEATR1 expression and Akt308
phosphorylation might be independent prognostic factors among
these variables (Supplementary Table S3). Overall, our results

HEATR1 Negatively Regulates Akt

showed that HEATR1 negatively regulates Akt activation, and
upregulation of Akt activity by the loss of HEATR1 in pancreatic
cancers might give rise to the resistance to chemotherapy (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Despite continuous efforts, effective early detection markers of
PDAC are currently not available and approximately 80% of
patients are diagnosed at locally advanced or metastatic stages
(29). In these patients at advanced stage, limited response to
current treatments results in an extremely poor prognosis (30).
Thus, improvements in diagnosis and predictability of patient
response to existing therapies are urgently needed for PDAC.
Cancer treatment by chemotherapy mainly induces apoptosis to
kill cancer cells. However, failure to activate apoptosis causes
resistance to therapy, which is an important clinical problem in
the treatment of cancers.
The Akt pathway, one of the most frequently hyperactivated
signaling pathways in human cancers, plays an important role in
both tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Half of PDAC tumors
demonstrated activation of Akt by immunohistochemical staining of pAkt (31). Signiﬁcant correlation between activation of Akt
and poor survival suggests an important role of Akt activation in
pancreatic cancer (32). Thus, targeted inhibition of Akt shows
promise in the treatment of pancreatic cancers given its role in
tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Currently, several smallmolecule inhibitors of Akt have been developed and are in various
stages of clinical testing (33). For instance, in combination with a
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (dinaciclib), the oral pan-AKT
inhibitor MK-2206 can dramatically block pancreatic tumor
growth and metastases in patient-derived xenograft models
(34). Phase I trial results of MK-2206 in patients with advanced
solid tumors indicate that MK-2206 was well tolerated, with
evidence of Akt signaling blockade (35). RX-0201, an antisense

www.aacrjournals.org

oligonucleotide to mRNA encoding Akt1, in combination with
gemcitabine were investigated in a phase II study and the safety
and efﬁcacy results are awaited (36). Thus, these AKT inhibitors
alone or in combination with other clinically approved anticancer
agents should be further explored in clinical studies as potential
novel therapeutic agents.
Here we found that depletion of HEATR1 in pancreatic cancer
cells causes resistance to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutic
agents (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). We propose that
HEATR1 functions in gemcitabine resistance through inhibiting
Akt activity. The evidence we observed are as follows. First, the
interaction between Akt and B56b was decreased when HEATR1
was depleted, indicating that HEATR1 acts as a scaffolding protein
for Akt and B56b, thereby enhancing the phosphatase activity of
B56b toward Thr308 (Fig. 2). Second, HEATR1 mutants that
abolish Akt or B56b interaction failed to affect Akt Thr308
phosphorylation and chemosensitivity (Fig. 3). Third, addition
of TCN sensitizes gemcitabine treatment in cells with low HEATR1
level both in vitro (Fig. 4A) and in animal models (Fig. 3B–D).
Finally, we demonstrated that the expression of HEATR1 is
positively correlated with OS in patients with pancreatic cancer
(Fig. 5).
Identiﬁcation of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for
PDAC patients has attracted much attention (29). However,
existing biomarkers such as CA19-9 are not adequate as early
detection markers of pancreatic cancer and predictor to treatment
response because of low sensitivity and speciﬁcity (37). The
biologic function of HEATR1 in sensitizing pancreatic cancer cell
to gemcitabine is potentially important. We report here that
HEATR1 expression level in PDAC signiﬁcantly correlates with
patient survival (Fig. 5), suggesting a potentially prognostic value.
Because gemcitabine represents the standard-of-care for PDAC,
therapeutic interventions targeting HEATR1 may improve outcome in combination with existing therapies. HEATR1 contains

2,144 amino acids, thus making it difﬁcult to restore HEATR1
expression in PDAC cancer cells. In the future, after we are able to
narrow down small motifs of HEATR1 responsible Akt or PP2A
binding, we might be able to engineer a polypeptide to restore the
regulation of Akt by PP2A. In addition, if we are able to identify
the mechanism of HEATR1 downregulation in PDAC, we might
be able to restore HEATR1 expression. However, how the expression of HEATR1 is deregulated in PDAC is unclear. From public
databases, we did not ﬁnd HEATR1 mRNA to be downregulated in
PDAC [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine]. The
HEATR1 gene is mutated in a small percentage of pancreatic
cancer cases (3.4%; TCGA); however, this could not account for
all pancreatic cancers showing weak immunohistochemical staining. We speculate that HEATR1 is downregulated in pancreatic
cancer at posttranscriptional level. Possible mechanisms include
decreased translation or protein turnover. Thus, further investigation is essential to understand how HEATR1 is dysregulated in
cancers. As an alternative strategy, combination therapy using an
Akt inhibitor and gemcitabine was able to overcome gemcitabine
resistance in PDAC.
Our study provides evidence of HEATR1 as a potential biomarker for predicting chemoresistance, although clinic outcomes
of the combination of therapies targeting Akt plus gemcitabine
should be further tested. It would also be interesting to investigate
whether HEATR1 is potentially implicated in cancer development
considering the role of Akt in cancers. Furthermore, although our
study mostly focused on gemcitabine and PDAC, our ﬁndings that
HEATR1 affects the response to other chemotherapeutic agents
would have broader impact for the treatment of other cancers and
should be validated in the future. In summary, we identify

HEATR1 as a negative regulator of the Akt pathway in PDAC and
a potential biomarker for predicting chemoresistance.
