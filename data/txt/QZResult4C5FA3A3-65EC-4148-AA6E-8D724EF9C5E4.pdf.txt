BACKGROUND: The short-term provision of ghrelin to patients with cancer indicates that there may be benefits from
long-term provision of ghrelin for the palliative treatment of weight-losing cancer patients. This hypothesis was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 study. METHODS: Weight-losing cancer patients with solid gastrointestinal tumors were randomized to receive either high-dose ghrelin treatment (13 lg/kg daily; n ¼ 17 patients) or
low-dose ghrelin treatment (0.7 lg/kg daily; n ¼ 14 patients) for 8 weeks as a once-daily, subcutaneous injections.
Appetite was scored on a visual analog scale; and food intake, resting energy expenditure, and body composition
(dual x-ray absorpitometry) were measured before the start of treatment and during follow-up. Serum levels of ghrelin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, growth hormone (GH), triglycerides, free fatty acids, and glucose were
measured. Health-related quality of life, anxiety, and depression were assessed by using standardized methods (the
36-item Short Form Health Survey and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Physical activity, rest, and sleep
were measured by using a multisensor body monitor. RESULTS: Treatment groups were comparable at inclusion.
Appetite scores were increased significantly by high-dose ghrelin analyzed both on an intent-to-treat basis and
according to the protocol. High-dose ghrelin reduced the loss of whole body fat (P < .04) and serum GH (P < .05).
There was a trend for high-dose ghrelin to improve energy balance (P < .07; per protocol). Otherwise, no statistically
significant differences in outcome variables were observed between the high-dose and low-dose groups. Adverse
effects were not observed by high-dose ghrelin, such as serum levels of tumor markers (cancer antigen 125 [CA 125],
carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA 19-9). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that daily, long-term provision of ghrelin to weight-losing cancer patients with solid tumors supports host metabolism, improves appetite, and

KEYWORDS: ghrelin, cancer cachexia, anorexia, randomized trial, body composition.

Anorexia and weight loss are severe health-related quality of life problems for patients with progressive malignant
disease. Recent studies in our laboratory have indicated that systemic anti-inflammatory treatment, nutritional support,
and insulin provision to cachectic cancer patients may all improve nutritional status, health-related quality of life, and survival in unselected patients.1-3 These findings are encouraging and demonstrate that a variety of metabolic interventions
can improve well being and physical functioning in palliative settings.4,5 However, anorexia has been particularly difficult
to counteract consistently despite well described concepts, although short-term benefits have been reported from trials
with steroid interventions to cancer patients.6,7 Therefore, a possibility to treat cancer patients with orexigenic drugs
should benefit a large group of patients.8,9 Results from acute or short-term provision of ghrelin or ghrelin agonists to
healthy volunteers and patients with cancer support the idea of benefits from long-term provision of ghrelin for palliative
support in weight-losing cancer patients.10-13 Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the long-term

effects of giving daily synthetic ghrelin to unselected,
weight-losing cancer patients in a randomized, doubleblind study (National Clinical Trial no. NCT00681486).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with systemic and progressive cancer were invited
to participate in our study for inclusion between 2006
and 2008 at our out patient clinic (Fig. 1). Inclusion criteria were progressive gastrointestinal cancer with systemic
spread without any further, ongoing specific tumor therapy; weight loss >5% and subjective appreciation of anorexia as a main cause behind health-related problems.
Exclusion criteria were age <40 years, manifest diabetes
(type I or II), steroid treatment, or any other treatment
known or assumed to affect tumor host metabolism.
Patients who were receiving nutritional support of any
kind were not invited to participate.
Treatment protocol, prerequisites and expectations
were explained for candidate patients. Inclusion measurements, which agreed with outcome variables, were secured
when patients agreed to participate. All patients were
randomized for either high-dose ghrelin treatment (10
lg/kg daily) or low-dose ghrelin treatment (0.5 lg/kg
daily). A trained nurse was responsible for information
and medical care interactions with patients’ medical home
care teams for treatment instructions at start up. All
patients were followed by a home care team. Some
patients subsequently asked for education, because they
wanted to take responsibility for their daily subcutaneous
injections according to similar, routine procedures.3
Patients and home care providers were instructed to give
ghrelin injections 30 to 45 minutes before the main daily
meal, which usually occurred between 11 AM and 12 noon
All injections were double blind. Ghrelin injections were
scheduled to continue daily for 8 weeks with outcome variables registered before and after this period. Some measurements also were obtained after 4 weeks of treatment in
combination with a general clinical evaluation by the physician in charge (Fig. 1). Twelve patients who were receiving high-dose ghrelin and 10 patients who were receiving
low-dose ghrelin finished the intended 8 weeks of treatment. Interruption of treatment was either for personal
(private) reasons (3 patients who were receiving high-dose
ghrelin and 2 patients who were receiving low-dose ghrelin) or because of progressive disease (2 patients who were
receiving high-dose ghrelin and 2 patients who were
receiving low-dose ghrelin).

Measurements at Inclusion and Follow-Up
Measurements for use in stratified randomization and follow-up were tumor type, tumor stage, previous tumor
treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy), age,
sex, height, nutritional status (body weight, weight loss,
serum albumin concentration), liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels), serum creatinine, blood
hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate, and C-reactive protein, and any previous use of analgesics, beta blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs. Measurements were repeated at 4 weeks and 8
weeks after inclusion (Fig. 1). Physiologic variables at rest
included heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
body temperature, respiratory rate, and resting energy expenditure. All drug medications were assessed before and
during follow-up.

Nutritional Assessments
Food intake was assessed by a dietician according to 4-day
records, as described previously.14,15 Urine samples were
used to verify registered protein intake. Resting energy
balance was derived as energy intake minus resting energy
expenditure to reflect the amount of energy available for
physical activity and repletion of energy stores. Body composition was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry as described elsewhere.2,3,14,16 Indirect calorimetry
was used to determine resting energy expenditure (Deltatrac; Datex, Helsinki, Finland) in the morning after an
overnight fast as described elsewhere.14,17
Blood Tests
Blood chemistry analyses included hemoglobin, glucose,
insulin, C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),
growth hormone (GH), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids
(FFA), white blood cell and thrombocyte counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, albumin, electrolyte and creatinine levels, liver function tests, and
tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], cancer
antigen 19-9 [CA 19-9], and CA 125) measured in
the Department of Clinical Chemistry at our hospital. Total ghrelin was measured by using a radioimmunoassay according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(GHRT89HK; Millipore/Linco, Billerica, Mass), and
active ghrelin was measured by using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (EZGRA8K; Millipore/Linco).
Health-Related Quality of Life
Health-related quality of life was assessed by using 1
global instrument (the 36-item Short Form Health Survey
[SF-36]) and 1 anxiety and depression scale (the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]).18,19
Daily Physical Activity
Spontaneous daily activity was measured for 3 days by the
Sense Wear System (Body Media, Pittsburgh, Pa; available at: www.bodymedia.com accessed on August 30,
2008). The Bodymedia SenseWear Pro 2 armband is a
multisensor body monitor worn on the triceps of the arm.
It can be worn for days or weeks and continuously records
physical activity signals. Periods and levels of physical activity are quantified while the monitor measures the number of steps, movements, and sleep and wake periods.
Physical activities are translated into energy expenditure
by an exclusive algorithm provided by the manufacturer.

Ghrelin
Ghrelin was provided free of charge by Gastrotech
Pharma A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark). The compound
was synthesized by Polypeptide Laboratories (Wolfenbuttel, Germany). The peptide content of the substance was
84.3% with acetate as the counter ion. The preparations
had between 98.41% and 99.63% peptide purity (catalog
no. P-0861, lot no. H-a-1096). The substance was prepared using guanylate, was dissolved in physiologic saline
(0.9%) on the day of injection, and was brought to the
patient by a nurse who administered the drug. Patients
received ampoules that contained either 800 lg or 40 lg
corresponding to high-dose and low-dose ghrelin, respectively, according to randomization. The amounts provided corresponded to 13  1 lg/kg daily or 0.7  0.04
lg/kg daily to account for individual body weight based
on 56 injections for each group over 8 weeks.
Statistics
Patients were randomized by a computerized algorithm to
high-dose ghrelin (n ¼ 17) or low-dose ghrelin (n ¼ 14)
by stratification as described by Pocock and Simon.20 The
following stratification variables were included to reduce
the risk of inappropriate skewness in important background variables: sex, age, body mass index (BMI), weight
loss, serum albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Creactive protein, liver function tests, drug intake, tumor
type, and disease stage. Power estimates before the study
on appetite scoring (a ¼ .05, b ¼ .80) made it likely to
detect differences between 31 randomized cancer patients
according to our unpublished experience. We hypothesized that elevated appreciation of food should be translated into statistically significant nutrition outcome
variables. The results are presented as mean  standard
error of the mean. All assessments of high-dose and lowdose treatment were analyzed by using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Two group analyses were conducted using a 1-way ANOVA. P values <.05
were considered statistically significant, and P values <.10
were considered a trend toward significance in 2-tailed
tests. All results were evaluated primarily on an intent-totreat basis and then according to the protocol (high-dose
group, n ¼ 12 patients; low-dose group, n ¼ 10 patients
in all tables and figures). This study was approved by the
Regional Ethical Review Board, Gothenburg (S543-03).

patients. Statistically significant differences were not
observed between patients in the high-dose and low-dose
groups at inclusion when they were analyzed on an intentto-treat basis or according to the protocol other than anamnestic weight loss (P < .04). Food intake and energy
expenditure did not differ significantly between patients
in the high-dose or low-dose group over time. However,
overall, subjectively scored appetite was significantly
higher in patients who received high-dose ghrelin compared with patients who received low-dose ghrelin (Table
2, Fig. 2). Serum albumin, insulin, and IGF-1 levels as
well as serum TG, FFA, and glucose did not differ
between the 2 groups at inclusion or at the end of 8 weeks
of treatment (Table 2). Serum ghrelin did not differ significantly among the treatment groups at inclusion or
over time, whereas basal serum GH levels decreased across
8 weeks of treatment among patients who were receiving
high-dose ghrelin. Two patients who were receiving lowdose ghrelin spontaneously had very high levels of both
active and total serum ghrelin. The endogenously
increased levels in these patients did not seem to translate
into altered clinical characteristics, such as appetite score
or food intake (results not shown).
Whole-body fat loss was less pronounced in cancer
patients who were receiving daily high-dose ghrelin compared with low-dose treatment (P < .04) (Table 2).
Whole-body fat-free mass (lean tissue) had a similar pattern but did not reach statistical significance. Improved
fat retention in patients who were receiving high-dose
ghrelin was reflected by a trend toward improved energy
balance during high-dose ghrelin treatment (P < .07)
(Fig. 2), because a significantly positive energy balance
was observed among patients in the high-dose group (P <
.05) (Fig. 2).
Health-related quality of life measured by global
scores (SF-36) as well as anxiety and depression scales
(HADS) did not differ over time between patients in the
high-dose and low-dose groups (Table 3). However,
patients who were receiving high-dose ghrelin had significantly less anxiety and higher scores for mental health at
inclusion compared with patients who were receiving lowdose ghrelin (Table 3). Physical activity (kcal daily), rest
per day (minutes), and sleep per day (minutes) did not
differ at inclusion or at 8 weeks of follow-up (Table 4).
No objective adverse effects were registered or associated
with ghrelin injections. Tumor markers did not increase
significantly in patients in the high-dose group (CA 125,

DISCUSSION
Anorexia and malnutrition are severe health-related quality-of-life–related sequelae in patients with progressive
cancer disease.6 Several previous attempts have been made
to attenuate anorexia by using various interventions, but
no these reportedly had consistent impact on the nutritional state.6,7 Therefore, there is considerable interest in

a possible role of ghrelin as an orexigenic peptide for the
treatment of anorexia.21-24 Ghrelin is synthesized mainly
in the upper third of the stomach with direct and indirect
effects in the area postrema, the nucleus of the solitary
tract, the nucleus of hypothalamus, and the brainstem,
but it also may have direct and indirect metabolic
effects on cells outside the central nervous system.25-32

Accordingly, providing ghrelin to tumor-bearing animals
has produced evidence that ghrelin promotes appetite in
cancer and other wasting conditions.33-35 Moreover, providing ghrelin as an intravenous infusion to normal individuals and to patients with cancer also has produced
evidence that ghrelin stimulates appetite acutely without
side effects.12 Therefore, the current study was planned as
a follow-up of previous experiments on animal provision
and short-term infusions to patients with the objective of
evaluating whether daily, long-term ghrelin may have
beneficial clinical effects in unselected, weight-losing cancer patients. A clear limitation of our study design was
that ghrelin could be provided only once daily because of
logistic and financial reasons among outpatients. Thus,
31 individuals represent a comparatively limited number
of patients for statistical power. Nevertheless, the study
was regarded worthwhile as a first step toward producing
eventual proof of concept for ghrelin and to gain experience from this kind of treatment. In addition, it is important to emphasize that applied statistical evaluations in a
2-group comparison over time represents a safe but comparatively weak model for demonstrating any significant
effects in 31 patients. All measurements were evaluated
initially with an intention to treat; however, outcome
results are presented per protocol treatment for those
patients who were able to complete 8 weeks of treatment.
All of our invited and participating patients
belonged to a group of weight-losing patients with subjectively severe anorexia for which no specific tumor therapy
was regarded meaningful or effective according to our previous studies.1-3,5 In addition, our patients could not have
diabetes and could not be receiving steroid treatment or
any other pharmacologic or nutritional support that had
any importance with regard to outcomes in the current
study. In fact, these kinds of patients are comparatively
rare, even in a large surgical and oncologic institution.
Thus, it is obvious that our study patients (high-dose
group) and our control patients (low-dose group) may
represent heterogeneous groups, although we stratified
their inclusion by a using computerized randomization
algorithm to minimize the risk of severe heterogeneity in
important variables related to appetite, metabolic rate,
nutritional state, and biochemical tests.20 Despite this
precaution, it is possible that the patients who received
high-dose ghrelin differed significantly from control
patients (low-dose ghrelin) in some important respects.
The worry may be that study patients seemed to suffer less
from depression and anxiety, as evaluated by using standardized items at inclusion (Table 3), and that the history

2050

of weight loss was 5% lower among patients in the highdose group, although the BMI was not different. It is also
possible that a dose of 13 lg/kg daily of ghrelin actually
was too low for subcutaneous injections compared with
the doses provided by others reported in the literature
from studies on healthy volunteers and intravenous infusions to cancer patients.12 However, the most important
limitation in our design probably was the infrequent daily
provision of ghrelin for the support of long-term improvements in patients with progressive disease.
With all of these limitations in mind, it was evident
that long-term provision of ghrelin did not cause any
obvious systemic or local side effects in any patient. In
addition, there was no indication that ghrelin injections
caused any consistent or statistically significant alteration
in tumor markers over time in patients who received highdose ghrelin compared with patients who received lowdose ghrelin, in agreement with our similar observations
during insulin treatment to cancer patients.3 It is important to emphasize this finding, because immune-histology
and cell culture experiments have provided some evidence
that ghrelin may stimulate tumor cell proliferation and
invasiveness.36-38 It also has been reported that malignant
tumors may produce metabolically active ghrelin in tumor
cells that express ghrelin receptors, suggesting the presence
of paracrine loops, which are observed particularly in endocrine tumors.36 In support of such observations, 2 of
our control patients (low-dose group) had surprisingly
and unfortunately very high levels of endogenous ghrelin.39-42 However, those patients were not identified as
clinical outliers at trial initiation or during follow-up.
Therefore, it remains uncertain whether their circulating
ghrelin levels had normal biologic effects.43
A most consistent finding in this study was that
appetite scores, whole-body fat retention, and serum GH
levels improved significantly during 8 weeks of treatment
in patients who received high-dose ghrelin compared with
patients who received low-dose ghrelin when analyzed
both on an intent-to-treat basis and according to the protocol. These findings occurred without confirmation of
significantly improved food intake, a measurement that
has comparatively high variation (5%-15%) in repeated
standardized measurements. Thus, dual x-ray absorpitometry measurements of body composition probably are
more sensitive and reproducible.1-3 Moreover, it is not
certain that whole-body fat retention depends preferentially on increased food intake after ghrelin administration. It may depend on the direct effects of ghrelin on
metabolism in regional fat depots31,44,45 or on other,

unrecognized effects on cachexia. Estimations of calculated resting energy balance also supported a trend toward
significantly improved energy balance over 8 weeks of
treatment in patients who received high-dose ghrelin (P <
.07), and the patients who received high-dose ghrelin
were in energy balance (P < .05). Thus, expected findings
from ghrelin treatment and subsequently altered GH levels, subjective appetite scoring, and evidence of improved
energy retention for fat deposition and perhaps for fatfree, lean tissue are encouraging observations indicating
that the long-term provision of ghrelin may improve
energy status and metabolism in weight-losing cancer
patients in future clinical applications. Previous investigations in cancer patients have confirmed increased peak
levels of GH after intravenous infusions of ghrelin.11 Our
current results on altered fasting and basal serum levels of
GH suggest that counter-regulatory effects by ghrelin
were preserved more by high-dose treatment compared
with low-dose treatment, because increased whole-body
catabolism usually is associated with increasing basal levels
of serum GH. Improvements by ghrelin did not induce
increased physical activity and, thus, were used preferentially for the protection of energy stores. However, there is
a need for the development of more easily provided dosing
methods before oral food intake considering the current
practical difficulties with stimulating the appetite using
ghrelin injections. Such a solution would be ghrelin provision as a nose spray. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this
is the first study in cancer patients suggesting that the
daily, long-term provision of ghrelin to weight-losing
patients with solid tumors supports host metabolism and
a sensation of improved appetite, which appears to
improve energy status in cachectic cancer patients.
