Abstract
More effective treatments for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are needed. APL cell treatment with
all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) degrades the chimeric, dominant-negative–acting transcription factor promyelocytic
leukemia gene (PML)/RARa, which is generated in APL by chromosomal translocation. The E1-like ubiquitinactivating enzyme (UBE1L) associates with interferon-stimulated gene ISG15 that binds and represses PML/
RARa protein. Ubiquitin protease UBP43/USP18 removes ISG15 from conjugated proteins. In this study, we
explored how RA regulates UBP43 expression and the effects of UBP43 on PML/RARa stability and APL growth,
apoptosis, or differentiation. RA treatment induced UBE1L, ISG15, and UBP43 expression in RA-sensitive but not
RA-resistant APL cells. Similar in vivo findings were obtained in a transgenic mouse model of transplantable APL,
and in the RA response of leukemic cells harvested directly from APL patients. UBP43 knockdown repressed
PML/RARa protein levels and inhibited RA-sensitive or RA-resistant cell growth by destabilizing the PML
domain of PML/RARa. This inhibitory effect promoted apoptosis but did not affect the RA differentiation
response in these APL cells. In contrast, elevation of UBP43 expression stabilized PML/RARa protein and
inhibited apoptosis. Taken together, our findings define the ubiquitin protease UBP43 as a novel candidate drug
target for APL treatment. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9875–85. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct subset of
myeloid leukemia (FAB, M3) (1). The t(15;17) rearrangement
present in APL fuses the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML)
on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor a (RARa)
on chromosome 17 (2, 3). PML/RARa is a dominant-negative
translocation product etiologic for APL (2, 3). Engineered
PML/RARa transgenic mice spontaneously develop leukemia, as reviewed (4, 5). All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) successfully treated APL patients by triggering leukemic cell
differentiation (6). One retinoid mechanism activated is
the induced proteasomal degradation of the RARa domain

of PML/RARa that inhibits its dominant-negative effects, as
previously reviewed (4, 5).
Another mechanism activated by RA treatment independently affects stability of the PML domain of PML/RARa
protein. This engaged the E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme
(UBE1L), which associates with the interferon-stimulated
gene 15 (ISG15) (4, 7–9). ISG15 conjugation of modified
proteins is removed by the ubiquitin protease 43 (UBP43/
USP18) (4, 10, 11).
Ubiquitination can regulate diverse biological processes,
including proteasomal degradation of proteins. ISG15, like
ubiquitin, can complex with proteins and the functional consequences of this are under active study (10, 11). ISG15 conjugation is executed by an enzymatic cascade that includes
UBE1L, an E2-conjugating enzyme (UbcH8), and E3 ligases (12).
ISG15 conjugation is specifically removed by UBP43, a member
of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family (13, 14). On type
I interferon (IFN) or lipopolysaccharide treatment, ISG15,
UBP43, and UBE1L are each rapidly upregulated (13, 15–17).
Regulation of ISG15ylation by UBP43 is associated with
diverse biological processes (18, 19). For example, UBP43
overexpression can inhibit cytokine-induced terminal differentiation of monocytic leukemia cells (20). UBP43-deficient
cells were reported as hypersensitive to IFN treatment (13, 21).
Studies in engineered mice revealed that UBP43 is important
for homeostasis of ISG15-conjugated proteins, which exert
specific biologic effects (22, 23).

RA-mediated differentiation of APL cells is accompanied by
PML/RARa proteolysis through caspase- and proteasomedependent degradation pathways, as previously summarized
(4, 5, 24). Loss of PML/RARa expression and induction of
apoptosis in APL cells followed arsenic treatment (25) or transfection of ribozymes that targeted PML/RARa for repression
(26). RA treatment augmented expression of UBE1L, a retinoid
target that repressed PML/RARa protein (8, 9). This also
increased ISG15 expression in APL cells (7–9). These proteins
repressed PML/RARa expression through a mechanism distinct
from that of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (7–9, 27, 28).
This study explored whether RA regulated UBP43 expression. The kinetics of augmented UBP43 expression in retinoid
sensitive versus resistant APL cells were related to UBE1L and
ISG15 expression profiles. Anti-UBP43 antisera were derived
for UBP43 immunoblot and enzymatic activity studies in APL
cells. The consequences of gain or loss of UBP43 expression on
PML/RARa stability and on APL growth, apoptosis, and differentiation were each examined. The UBE1L-ISG15-UBP43 pathway was studied before and after RA treatment of a transgenic
APL model and of leukemic cells harvested directly from APL
patients. The findings obtained provide strong evidence for
UBP43 as a previously unrecognized therapeutic target in APL.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
RA-sensitive NB4-S1 and RA-resistant NB4-R1 APL cell lines
(7) were cultured in Advanced RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) media with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini, Calabasas,
CA), 4 mmol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/mL penicillin
(Invitrogen), and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) (8, 9).
BEAS-2B–immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells were
cultured in serum-free LHC-9 media (Biofluids, Akron, OH) (7,
8). COS-7 cells were cultured in Advanced DMEM (Invitrogen)
media with 10% of FBS, 4 mmol/L of L-glutamine, 100 units/mL
of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
Real-time RT-PCR assays
Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent
(Invitrogen) and cDNA synthesis was performed using the
High-Capacity cDNA Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) and a Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research,
Waltham, MA). Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed with
iTaq Fast SYBR Green Supermix with an ROX Kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) and the 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). Three independent replicate experiments were performed. Primers were as follows: human

Expression plasmids and transient transfection
The pcDNA4-UBP43, pSG5-UBE1L, His6-tagged pcDNA3ISG15, pCMV-hemagglutinin (HA)-PML/RARa, pCMV-HAPML, and pCMV-HA-RARa expression vectors were previously
described (7–9). The full-length coding region of human UBP43
was cloned into the pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1 vector (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA) at BamH1 and Not1 restriction endonuclease sites to engineer the pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1-UBP43
retrovirus. The insertless retrovirus served as a control. The
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression plasmid (EGFP-N2; Clontech), short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–UBP43
retroviruses (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL), and an insertless control vector (Open Biosystems) were purchased.
Independent transient transfection of logarithmically growing BEAS-2B and COS-7 cells was accomplished using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and
optimized methods (29). EGFP-expressing plasmids were used
to assess transfection efficiencies. Transfections were conducted in triplicate and each experiment was independently
replicated 3 times.
Independent transient transfection of NB4-S1 and NB4-R1
APL cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) was accomplished using the Nucleofector Technology (Lonza, Walkersville,
MD) (9). The siRNAs targeting UBP43 or an RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC)–free control siRNA were synthesized
(Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Different siRNAs targeted UBP43:
UBP43 siRNA1 (50 -CTGCATATCTTCTGGTTTA-30 ) and UBP43
siRNA2 (50 -GGAAGAAGACAGCAACATG-30 ). Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfecting the siGLO Green
Transfection Indicator (Dharmacon).
Generation of stable UBP43-expressing
APL transfectants
The pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1-UBP43 retroviral vector and an
insertless control retrovirus were independently transfected
into the RetroPack PT67 Packaging Cell Line (Clontech) using
FuGENE 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Viral supernatants from
transfectants were used to transduce NB4-R1 or NB4-S1 cells
with 4 mg/mL of polybrene (Sigma, Milwaukee, WI). GFP-positive cells were harvested 48 hours later using a FACStar Plus
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). This was repeated a
week later to enrich for transductants, as done earlier (7). Doubly
selected cells were studied. Three independent experiments
were conducted with each study performed in triplicate.
The shRNA retrovirus selected for knockdown of UBP43
was isolated from PT67 cells and used to transduce independently NB4-S1 and NB4-R1 cells. Stable transductants

were selected after 14 days of puromycin (2 mg/mL; Sigma)
treatment. Several candidate shRNAs were transduced into
NB4 cells and the one that most prominently knockeddown
UBP43 was chosen for study.
Generation of anti-UBP43 antisera
Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies were derived (Covance,
Denver, PA) against human UBP43 protein using 1 peptide
nearer to the amino terminus (FDVDSKPLKTLEDALHC,
anti-UBP43-1) than the other (CGKKTRGKQVLKLTHLPQ,
anti-UBP43-2). Antibody specificities were confirmed by
immunoblot analyses of COS-7-transfected cells with the
pcDNA4-UBP43 construct versus controls. Preimmune antisera were used as additional controls.
Immunoblot analyses
APL and other cells were lysed with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer using optimized methods (8, 9, 30).
Lysates were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE assays before
transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway,
NJ). Primary antibodies for immunoblot analyses were a rabbit
polyclonal antibody that recognized PML/RARa (Abcam Inc.,
Cambridge, MA), a murine monoclonal antibody that recognized HA-tagged proteins (Babco, Richmond, CA) and a goat
polyclonal antibody that recognized actin (Santa Cruz, Santa
Cruz, CA). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antisera were purchased
from Amersham (Piscataway, NJ) and anti-goat antiserum
from Santa Cruz. These were used as respective secondary
antibodies. Quantifications of signals were scored as before (7–
9). To assess PML/RARa protein stability after UBP43 transfection, cells were treated with or without cycloheximide (CHX;
40 mg/mL; Sigma) for indicated time periods.
Measurement of UBP43 activity
UBP43 enzymatic activity in APL cells was assayed using
established methods (31). Briefly, NB4-S1 cells were lysed in
RIPA buffer and protein supernatants were incubated with or
without HA-ISG15-vinylmethyl ester (HA-ISG15-VME, Boston
Biochem Inc, Cambridge, MA) at 37 C for 60 minutes before
incubation with protein G agarose beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL)
and an anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz) for at least 2 hours at
4 C to precipitate complexes. The HA-ISG15-VME probe
forms an irreversible covalent bond with active deubiquitinases. Immunoblot analyses were independently performed
using an anti-HA (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) or an antiUBP43 antibody (anti-UBP43-1 or anti-UBP43-2).
Proliferation and apoptosis assays
The day before proliferation assays were conducted, the
desired cells (1  105 cells/mL) were plated onto individual
6-well tissue culture plates. Three independent wells were
seeded in each experiment with triplicate independent replicate
experiments performed. Proliferation was measured using the
CellTiter-Glo Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and established
methods (29). Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V–FITC
positivity by flow cytometry using the Annexin V Assay Kit (AbD
Serotec, Raleigh, NC). Apoptosis within engineered APL cell
lines was assayed with the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay Kit (Promega).

Expression studies in transgenic APL mice
Murine transgenic APL studies used previously optimized
methods (32). The experiments were performed after review
and approval by Dartmouth's Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC). Briefly, 4 female FVB mice (7-weeks
old) were tail vein injected with 2  105 transgenic APL donor
cells for each time point. Two of these mice were treated with
RA and 2 were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a
vehicle control. Twenty days after these injections, RA (2 mg)
was intraperitoneally injected into each of the 2 mice and the
same DMSO volume was administered to each control mouse.
Clinical APL was evident 20 days after donor APL cell injections (32). RA-treated and control mice were independently
sacrificed at indicated time points using IACUC-approved
procedures. APL cells were harvested from spleens, as in prior
work (32). Total RNA was isolated as before (7–9) for real-time
RT-PCR assays. Findings from all mice treated in each respective arm were pooled for analyses.
UBP43 expression in human APL cells
Fresh APL cells were harvested as a part of an Institutional
Review Board–approved protocol using previously optimized
methods (32). APL cells were cultured in the presence of RA or
vehicle (DMSO). RNA was harvested 24 hours after RA
(1 mmol/L) or vehicle treatments. Differentiation response
was scored by the percentage of nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT)stained cells after 5 days of RA (100 nm) or vehicle treatments.
Real-time RT-PCR assays for UBE1L, ISG15, UBP43, and
GAPDH were each performed after 24 hours of RA treatment
and results were compared with vehicle controls.
Statistical analyses
Two-tailed t tests were used. Results appear as mean  SD.
Statistical significance is noted in the text and figures as well
as with the following symbols: P < 0.01 (*) and P < 0.005 (**).

Results
UBP43 expression in APL cells
UBE1L, a retinoid target (7, 8), along with its ubiquitin-like
partner ISG15, destabilized PML/RARa (9) and cyclin D1 (33)
via ISG15 conjugation to these respective proteins. That the
ISG15 deconjugase UBP43-antagonized UBE1L-mediated
repression of these proteins (9, 33) implicated UBP43 as a
pharmacologic target. This study determined the effects of RA
treatment on mRNA expression profiles of UBE1L, ISG15, and
UBP43 in RA-sensitive NB4-S1 and in RA-resistant NB4-R1
APL cells using real-time RT-PCR assays (Fig. 1A). UBE1L and
ISG15 mRNA expression profiles were augmented by RA
treatment beginning at 12 hours and these increased further
in NB4-S1 cells at later time points (Fig. 1A). The maximal
induction observed after RA treatment was at 72 hours for
UBE1L, at 96 hours for ISG15, and at 48 hours for UBP43.
In contrast, UBE1L, ISG15, and UBP43 inductions were markedly blunted despite RA treatment of NB4-R1 APL cells. UBP43
mRNA expression (relative to vehicle controls) was augmented
by RA treatment of NB4-S1 cells after observed increases in
UBE1L and ISG15 expression. This delayed UBP43 induction was

Figure 1. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) regulation of UBE1L, ISG15, and UBP43 mRNA expression in RA-sensitive versus RA-resistant acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. A, RA-sensitive NB4-S1 cells and RA-resistant NB4-R1 APL cells were each cultured with RA (1 mmol/L) or with vehicle
for the indicated times in hours (h). UBE1L, ISG15, UBP43, and GAPDH mRNAs were each assessed by real-time RT-PCR assays. Similar results were
obtained from 3 independent experiments. A representative result is shown. RA treatment induced UBE1L and ISG15 before UBP43 expression in
NB4-S1 cells, but these species were not induced in NB4-R1 APL cells. B and C, immunogenic peptides generated the indicated anti-UBP43
polyclonal antibodies (see Materials and Methods). UBP43 protein was detected in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA4-UBP43 (þ), but not with an
insertless control pcDNA4 vector (). The 43-kDa UBP43 protein was detected using these respective antibodies. This protein was not detected when
preimmune antisera for each antibody was probed to each respective filter. Molecular weight size markers are displayed.

consistent with an indirect RA-treatment effect on UBP43
expression in APL cells. This was supported by bioinformatic
analysis of the UBP43 promoter. This did not reveal the presence
of RA-responsive elements in the UBP43 promoter and UBP43
reporter activity in transfected BEAS-2B cells was not appreciably affected by RA treatment (data not shown).
UBP43 protein expression in APL cells
Different rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing UBP43
protein were derived (see Materials and Methods) to examine
RA-treatment effects on UBP43 protein expression in APL
cells. To confirm specificity of the 2 anti-UBP43 antibodies,
COS-7 cells that did not basally express detectable UBP43
protein were transfected with a human UBP43 or an insertless
control vector. As expected, COS-7 UBP43 transfectants
expressed UBP43 protein identified by either anti-UBP43-1

9878

or anti-UBP43-2 antibodies, but cells transfected with an
insertless vector did not express this protein (Fig. 1B and
C). In each case, preimmune serum was used as a negative
control (Fig. 1B and C).
UBP43 is reported as the protease specific for ISG15 (13, 34).
To confirm that the expected complex between ISG15 and
UBP43 was formed in APL cells, NB4-S1 cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, before immunoblotting independently with an anti-HA or the anti-UBP43-1
antibody. UBP43 conjugated with ISG15 in these APL cells, as
confirmed by an anti-HA or the anti-UBP43-1 antibody (Fig. 2A,
two left panels). HA-tagged ISG15 is identified (hatched arrow,
left panel) along with other possibly nonspecific species in
Figure 2A (left and middle panels). UBP43 is expressed and
active in these cells. Figure 2A (right panel) shows that UBP43
can remove ISG15 from PML/RARa protein.

Figure 2. UBP43 is expressed and active in APL cells. A, ISG15-UBP43 conjugation was detected in NB4-S1 APL cells. Immunoprecipitation (IP) with
an anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblotting (IB) with a second anti-HA antibody (left) or an anti-UBP43 antibody (middle) revealed ISG15-UBP43
complex formation in NB4-S1 APL cells preincubated with HA-ISG15-vinylmethyl ester (HA-ISG15-VME). Closed arrows depict positions of UBP43
conjugated with ISG15, the open arrow indicates unconjugated UBP43 protein, and the hatched arrow shows the position of HA-tagged ISG15. The
absence of HA-tagged ISG15 detection in the first lane of the left panel is because of no HA-tagged ISG15 addition to this lysate. Other species detected in
the left and middle panels likely represent nonspecific signals. Right, UBP43 can remove ISG15 from PML/RARa protein following anti-HA
immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged PML/RARa protein followed by anti-HA or anti-ISG15 IB to detect PML/RARa. Molecular weight size markers are
displayed. B and C, independent immunoblot expression for UBP43 in NB4-R1 and in NB4-S1 APL cells treated with RA (1 mmol/L) or vehicle (DMSO) for the
indicated hours (h). No appreciable change in UBP43 expression occurred after RA treatment of NB4-R1 APL cells (B). In contrast, UBP43 was induced
after 48 hours of RA treatment in NB4-S1 APL cells (C). Quantifications of respective signals are presented.

Next, RA regulation of UBP43 protein was examined. Induction of UBP43 protein followed RA treatment of RA-sensitive
NB4-S1 cells, but not of RA-resistant NB4-R1 cells (Fig. 2B and
C). Quantifications of signals appear below these immunoblots.
RA treatment augmented UBE1L and ISG15 protein expression
and destabilized PML/RARa protein (8, 9). UBP43 mRNA
induction followed that of UBE1L and ISG15 mRNAs raising
the possibility that UBP43 directly affected PML/RARa protein
stability. Experiments were conducted to examine this.
UBP43-affected PML/RARa stability
UBE1L repressed PML/RARa protein by targeting the PML,
but not the RARa domain of PML/RARa (9); UBP43 antagonized this UBE1L effect (9). UBP43 effects on stabilities of
different PML/RARa domains were uncovered by transient
cotransfection experiments using constructs (9) expressing

full-length PML/RARa, or respective PML or RARa domains
of PML/RARa. Immunoblot analyses revealed that UBP43
cotransfection in BEAS-2B cells enhanced expression of both
full-length PML/RARa (Fig. 3A, construct 1) and the PML
domain of PML/RARa (Fig. 3A, construct 2), but no effects
were observed on the expressed RARa domain of PML/RARa
(Fig. 3A, construct 3). Quantification for each respective signal
is presented in the corresponding right panels of Figure 3A.
Similar transfection efficiencies were achieved in each arm of
the experiments as confirmed by EGFP expression vector
cotransfection and immunoblot experiments, as displayed
in this figure. Engineered UBP43 overexpression did not
appreciably affect the proportion of EGFP-expressing transfected cells (data not shown and Fig. 3A).
To study further UBP43 effects on PML/RARa protein
stability, UBP43 was cotransfected with an HA-tagged

Figure 3. Effects of UBP43 transfection on PML/RARa protein stability. A, three different constructs, designated 1 through 3, assessed PML/RARa protein
domain stabilities after engineered UBP43 overexpression. The EGFP expression vector served as a transfection control. Actin expression confirmed
similar amounts of loaded proteins. Quantifications of these indicated immunoblot signals appear on the right. Full-length PML/RARa and the PML, but not
RARa domains of PML/RARa were stabilized by UBP43. B, effects of UBP43 on transfected HA-tagged PML/RARa in BEAS-2B cells. Immunoblot
expression for PML/RARa and actin is shown in the presence (þ) or absence () of cycloheximide (CHX; 40 mg/mL) treatment. UBP43 stabilized exogenous
PML/RARa protein despite CHX-treatment, as detected by the anti-HA antibody. Quantification of signals is provided. C and D, UBP43 knockdown
in APL cells. Transient transfection of 2 independent UBP43 targeting siRNAs versus an inactive control siRNA (see Materials and Methods) reduced
UBP43 and decreased PML/RARa immunoblot expression in NB4-S1 cells (C). UBP43 knockdown by each siRNA targeting UBP43 significantly (*, P < 0.01)
induced apoptosis versus inactive control siRNA (D).

UBP43 transfection increased PML-RARa protein stability,

UBP43 and apoptosis
Prior work found that UBE1L triggered PML/RARa degradation and apoptosis in APL cells (7–9). Whether UBP43
affected apoptosis in APL cells by targeting PML-RARa protein was studied. To ascertain effects of UBP43 on PML/RARa
expression, 2 different siRNAs targeting UBP43 and a RISCfree control siRNA were independently transfected into NB4S1 cells (Fig. 3C, left panel). Knockdown of UBP43 by each of
these UBP43-targeting siRNAs significantly decreased UBP43
and PML/RARa immunoblot expression versus controls in
APL cells. Actin expression was unaffected (Fig. 3C). Com-

pared with RISC-free siRNA controls, knockdown of UBP43 by
each siRNA targeting UBP43 significantly augmented apoptosis, as confirmed by Annexin V and propidium iodide
staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
(Fig. 3D). Compared with RISC-free control cells, UBP43
knockdown in NB4-S1 cells augmented apoptosis at day 1
and this increased over the 3 days of this study. A decline in
PML/RARa protein accompanied this (Fig. 3C).
To confirm and extend these transient UBP43 knockdown
findings, stable retroviral shRNA-mediated repression of
UBP43 was achieved. The consequences of this on PML/RARa
expression and on apoptosis were studied in NB4 transductants. Stable knockdown of UBP43 was engineered by
retroviral transductions and puromycin selection of the
desired shRNA independently expressed in NB4-R1 and
NB4-S1 cells. Figure 4A established that shRNA-mediated

Figure 4. A, stable UBP43 knockdown by retroviral transduction of UBP43 shRNA in APL cells. UBP43 shRNA transduction (þ) destabilized endogenous
PML/RARa protein expression as compared with an insertless retrovirus vector () independently in NB4-R1 (left) and NB4-S1 APL cells (right). Actin
expression confirmed similar protein loading. B, retroviral-mediated knockdown of UBP43 triggered significant apoptosis in NB4-R1 (left) and NB4-S1
(right) APL cells. C, independent retroviral-mediated knockdown of UBP43 in NB4-R1 and NB4-S1 APL cells significantly inhibited proliferation as
compared with an insertless retroviral vector. Significant changes are depicted (**, P < 0.005).

UBP43 knockdown reduced endogenous PML/RARa expression in both transduced APL cell lines (relative to insertless
vector controls). Stable UBP43 knockdown in NB4-R1 and
NB4-S1 cells significantly increased apoptosis in both the cells
(Fig. 4B). RA treatment of UBP43 knockdown NB4-S1 cells did
significantly promote apoptosis but did not affect differentiation response (Supplementary Fig. S1). Figure 4B showed that
compared with these respective control transfectants, UBP43
knockdown in these APL cells produced significant (**, P <
0.005) apoptosis.
UBP43 overexpression was independently achieved in NB4-S1
and NB4-R1 cells, as shown in Figure 5. Unlike UBP43 knockdown, retroviral-mediated UBP43 overexpression augmented
PML/RARa expression in both APL cell lines (Fig. 5A) and
reduced apoptosis (Fig. 5B) relative to insertless vector controls.
UBP43-regulated APL cell growth
Because UBP43 knockdown promoted apoptosis in APL
cells by targeting PML/RARa for repression, effects of UBP43

knockdown on growth were studied in NB4 cells with engineered loss or gain of UBP43 expression. CellTiter-Glo assays
confirmed that UBP43 knockdown conferred a marked repression of NB4-S1 and NB4-R1 cell growth (Fig. 4C). In contrast,
engineered UBP43 overexpression significantly (**, P < 0.005)
promoted growth as compared with insertless vector controls
for both APL cell lines (Fig. 5C).
RA treatment of APL mice
To determine whether RA induced UBP43 expression in vivo,
a murine transgenic transplantable APL model was studied
(35). Clinical evidence of APL occurred in recipients 20 days
after transgenic APL cell injections into FVB mice. Mice were
then sacrificed and RNA was isolated from harvested spleens
(see Materials and Methods). UBE1L, ISG15, and UBP43 mRNA
expression profiles were each significantly augmented after RA
treatment versus vehicle control-treated APL mice (Fig. 6A).
These findings extended results from cultured APL cells to the
setting of APL in mice.

Figure 5. Gain of UBP43 expression in APL cells. A, independent UBP43 immunoblot analyses were performed in the indicated APL cell lines engineered
after UBP43 (þ) or an insertless () retroviral transduction. Increased UBP43 expression augmented PML/RARa expression in NB4-R1 (left) and
NB4-S1 APL cells (right). Actin expression confirmed similar protein loading. B, UBP43 retroviral transduction-inhibited apoptosis in NB4-R1 and NB4-S1
cells versus insertless control transduction, as measured by these caspase 3/7 assays. C, engineered gain of UBP43 expression augmented
proliferation of NB4-R1 and NB4-S1 APL cells versus insertless vector controls. Significant changes are depicted (**, P < 0.005).

RA treatment of APL cells from patients
Whether RA increased UBE1L, ISG15, and UBP43 mRNA
expression profiles in cultures of leukemic cells was studied in
APL cells harvested directly from patients. APL cells from 2
different RA-responsive cases augmented UBE1L, ISG15, and
UBP43 mRNA expression after 24 hours of RA treatment
relative to controls (Fig. 6B). No significant change in UBE1L
expression was observed, but when the ISG15 and UBP43
results after RA treatment were pooled, significant changes
were observed (P ¼ 0.0024, n ¼ 3). RA treatment also caused
differentiation to occur in RA-sensitive cases, as shown by
increased NBT-positive APL cells (Fig. 6B). Cells from a representative RA-resistant APL case with an inactivating PML/
RARa ligand-binding domain mutation similar to that in NB4R1 cells (36, 37) were examined. Deregulated UBE1L, ISG15, and
UBP43 expression and minimal NBT augmentation were
observed, despite RA treatment of these APL cells (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
This study builds on prior work that revealed retinoid
treatment of APL cells augmented UBE1L and ISG15
expression and ISG15ylation (8, 9) by showing that the
deconjugase, UBP43, is also regulated by RA treatment of
APL cells. RA induction of UBP43 mRNA did not increase until
48 hours (Fig. 1A). That retinoid effects on UBP43 were
indirect was consistent with bioinformatic analysis and
UBP43 reporter assay results. RA-mediated induction of
UBP43 occurred in RA-sensitive but not in RA-resistant
APL cells (Figs. 1 and 2). RA treatment also augmented
UBE1L and ISG15 mRNA expression in RA-sensitive but not
in RA-resistant APL cells. Increased UBE1L and ISG15 expression accompanied RA treatment, but occurred earlier than did
UBP43 induction. This indicated that a negative regulatory
loop likely exists to limit ISG15ylation (8) via induction of

Figure 6. RA treatment of a murine transgenic transplantable APL model and of APL cells harvested directly from patients. A, UBE1L, ISG15, and
UBP43 mRNA expression profiles were each studied in RA-treated versus vehicle control-treated APL mice (see Materials and Methods). After RA
treatment for the indicated hours (h), UBE1L, ISG15, and UBP43 mRNAs were each increased in the isolated spleens. B, RA treatment induced UBE1L,
ISG15, and UBP43 mRNA expression in cultured human APL cells from 2 representative RA-responsive cases, but not appreciably in a representative
RA-resistant APL case. Expression profiles were studied after RA treatment or no treatment and differentiation response was assessed by nitrotetrazolium
blue (NBT) staining as described in the Materials and Methods. NBT-positive cells appeared after RA treatment of RA-responsive but minimally in
RA-resistant APL cells from these cases. Significant changes are indicated (**, P < 0.005).

UBP43. Assays displayed in Figure 2A showed that UBP43 was
expressed and functionally active in APL cells.
PML/RARa expression is diagnostic for APL (2, 3). Leukemic cell growth and differentiation are linked to PML/
RARa expression (4, 5). Loss of PML/RARa markedly
affected APL cell growth. Prior work revealed that ribozyme-mediated repression of PML/RARa was antileukemogenic at least partly by triggering apoptosis of RA-sensitive
and RA-resistant APL cells (26, 37). RA and arsenic trioxide
also individually triggered PML/RARa degradation and conferred differentiation or apoptosis, respectively, as reviewed
(38). RA treatment caused PML/RARa degradation through
caspase- and proteasome-dependent mechanisms (9, 28, 39).
RA engaged caspase-3, which targeted PML/RARa
for repression (39). Likewise, UBE1L was induced by RA

www.aacrjournals.org

treatment, and this repressed PML/RARa expression and
promoted apoptosis (7).
IFN treatment augmented UBE1L, ISG15, and UBP43
expression (13, 15–17). Retinoids can crosstalk with UBE1L
and ISG15 protein expression (7–9, 33). This was previously
implicated in regulating PML/RARa stability and apoptosis (7,
9). That UBP43 is an antineoplastic target was suggested by
previous retinoid work (7, 9).
The present study extended that work by showing UBP43
regulated PML/RARa protein stability. Prior findings indicated
that PML/RARa can undergo ISG15ylation and target the PML
domain for repression, but on the contrary, RA affected PML/
RARa stability through its RARa domain (9). These findings
reveal that 2 distinct degradation pathways are activated by RA
treatment. In the current study, transfection experiments

Guo et al.

found that UBP43 also has domain-specific PML/RARa effects
that targeted for repression the PML but not RARa domain, in
accord with prior work that studied UBE1L effects in APL cells
(9). Future work should determine which residue(s) in the PML
domain of PML/RARa undergo ISG15 modification.
This study directly linked UBP43 to PML/RARa stabilization by showing that increased PML/RARa protein stability
followed UBP43 transfection, despite CHX treatment (Fig. 3B).
As expected, knockdown of UBP43 destabilized PML/RARa
protein and promoted apoptosis in APL cells (Figs. 4 and 5).
Yet, differentiation was not apparently affected as was the case
following ribozyme-dependent or arsenic-mediated PML/
RARa degradation (25, 26, 37). In contrast, UBP43 overexpression stabilized PML/RARa protein and promoted APL cell
growth (Figs. 4 and 5), indicating that PML/RARa exerts
antiapoptotic effects in APL.
Prior work directly implicated PML in regulation of apoptosis
and proliferation (40). PML effects on cell growth might be from
its ability to promote apoptosis through intrinsic or extrinsic
pathways (41). PML affects apoptosis through different
mechanisms, either by serving as a transcriptional modification
and activation platform for the p53 tumor suppressor, or by
regulating expression and localization of apoptotic regulators,
as reviewed (40–42). Prior work found that arsenic treatment
increased PML assembly into PML nuclear bodies, important
for PML regulation of apoptosis. This assembly depends on
posttranslational modification of PML with small ubiquitin-like
modifier 1 (SUMO-1) (40–42). SUMO is related to ISG15, but
SUMOylation engages distinct effects, as reviewed (40–42).
The hypothesis that UBP43 is an antineoplastic target is
consistent with recent work reported with the deubiquitinase
USP9X, which promoted cancer cell survival by regulating
stability of a prosurvival BCL2 family member (43). Analogous
to that study, it was found here that knockdown of another

deconjugase, UBP43, destabilized PML/RARa protein and
triggered apoptosis whereas gain of UBP43 expression
opposed these effects. Notably, UBP43 was found to be active
in APL cells (Fig. 2A). Findings from mice and patients with
APL revealed that UBP43 is expressed in APL cells and
regulated by RA treatment (Fig. 6). Given this, pharmacologic
inhibition of UBP43 would likely affect not only APL biology,
but also APL therapy.
In summary, this study identified UBP43 as an antineoplastic target in APL. UBP43 directly affected PML/RARa stability
and regulated APL cell growth. Knockdown of UBP43
repressed PML/RARa and this, in turn, reduced APL cell
growth by promoting apoptosis. Pharmacologic targeting of
the UBE1L-ISG15-UBP43 pathway, especially through inhibition of UBP43, is an appealing therapeutic approach to consider in APL and other malignancies.
