p53 Modulates Acquired Resistance to EGFR Inhibitors
and Radiation

Abstract
There is presently great interest in mechanisms of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitors that are now being used widely in the treatment of a variety of common human
cancers. To investigate these mechanisms, we established EGFR inhibitor–resistant clones from non–small
cell lung cancer cells. A comparative analysis revealed that acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors was
associated consistently with the loss of p53 and cross-resistance to radiation. To examine the role of
p53, we ﬁrst knocked down p53 in sensitive parental cells and found a reduction in sensitivity to both
EGFR inhibitors and radiation. Conversely, restoration of functional p53 in EGFR inhibitor–resistant
cells was sufﬁcient to resensitize them to EGFR inhibitors or radiation in vitro and in vivo. Further studies
indicate that p53 may enhance sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and radiation via induction of cell-cycle
arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest a central role of p53 in
the development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and prompt consideration to apply p53
restoration strategies in future clinical trials that combine EGFR inhibitors and radiation. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a family
member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases and is important in oncogenesis. The activation of EGFR ultimately
promotes tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and
angiogenesis. Hence, blockade of EGFR has emerged as a
highly promising cancer therapy approach over the last
decade (1, 2). To date, several EGFR targeting agents have
shown preclinical and clinical promise and gained U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in recent
years, such as cetuximab, panitumumab, geﬁtinib, and erlotinib (3, 4). Despite a series of promising clinical trial results,
increasing evidence indicates that most patients who initially respond to treatment eventually manifest tumor recurrence following EGFR therapy (5–7). These ﬁndings suggest
that acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors has developed
and underscore the importance of understanding molecular
mechanisms of resistance to further the advancement of
EGFR inhibitor therapies in oncology.

A number of recent reports have suggested potential
mechanisms for acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. These
include mutations in EGFR, KRAS, or the activation of other
receptor tyrosine kinases, such as ErbB3 or c-Met, to effectively
bypass the effect of EGFR inhibitors (8, 9). The EGFR mutation
T790M has been found in non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) patients with acquired resistance to geﬁtinib and
erlotinib (10). However, these EGFR mutations seem of value
to predict response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as
opposed to EGFR monoclonal antibodies, and are relatively
infrequent across the spectrum of human cancer types tested
to date (11). Furthermore, patients without EGFR mutations
still manifest acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Therefore, it remains critical to explore additional mechanisms of
acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors.
One experimental approach to explore acquired resistance
involves preclinical model systems that select for EGFR inhibitor–resistant clones and conduct molecular screening to
assess changes that occur during the evolution of resistance.
In the current study, we established a series of resistant clones
to 2 different classes of EGFR inhibitors, cetuximab and
erlotinib, from sensitive cell lines without EGFR and KRAS
mutations following long-term EGFR inhibitor exposure. Following high throughput Western-based screening, we identiﬁed a robust loss of p53 in all resistant clones. In addition, our
previous studies suggested cross-resistance to radiation in
those cells with acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors (12).
Because p53 has been shown to play a role in regulating
response to radiation and several chemotherapeutic agents,
we systematically investigated the impact of p53 in regulating
acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation in our
EGFR inhibitor–resistant cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies are listed in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Cell cultures
The human lung H226 (NCI-H226), A549, and H292 tumor
cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The human head and neck SCC6 (UM-SCC6) cells were
kindly provided by Dr. Thomas E. Carey (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Both H262 and H292 were maintained
in RPMI with 10% FBS. SCC6 and A549 were cultured
routinely in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone. EGFR
inhibitor–resistant clones of H226 and SCC6 were developed
as described previously (8). All cells were authenticated by
sequencing the wild-type status of p53. Cell culture media and
supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.
BD PowerBlot Western Array
Total cellular proteins from parental or resistant cells were
extracted by a lysis buffer containing 10 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.4,
0.1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and 1% SDS followed by
sonication. Cell extracts were then sent to BD Biosciences for
analysis as described previously (13). Detailed information is
provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
RNA interference of p53
p53 siRNA was obtained from Dharmacon. Cells were
transfected with the p53 siRNA using DharmaFECT reagent
following the manufacturer's procedures.
Cell proliferation assay
Viable growing cells were determined by crystal violet
staining as described previously (12).
Neutral comet assay
To detect radiation-induced DNA damage, a CometAssay kit
from Trevigen was used according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The comet assay conducted using neutral conditions will detect mainly double-stranded breaks of DNA and
can be useful for assessing the DNA damage following radiation. Detailed information is provided in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Transfection of p53
Cetuximab-resistant (Cet-R) cells were ﬁrst transiently
transfected with a pC53-SN plasmid (a gift from Dr. Honnavara
N. Ananthaswamy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
TX) encoding human wild-type p53 using Effectene reagent
(Qiagen). To create a stable clone with inducible p53, we
applied a T-REx system (Invitrogen) that is a tetracyclineregulated mammalian expression system based on the binding
of tetracycline to a tetracycline repressor and derepression
of the promoter controlling the expression of p53 (14). In
brief, Cet-R cells were ﬁrst transfected with the pcDNA6/TR
vector expressing the tetracycline repressor (Invitrogen) using
Effectene reagent following manufacturer's instructions. Cells

were selected with 50 mg/mL of blasticidin for 48 to 72 hours
and then grown in 5 mg/mL of blasticidin in 96-well plates.
Stable clones were selected and expanded on the basis of
their expression of the tetracycline repressor determined by
Western blotting. In parallel, the pC53-SN plasmid was
digested with BamHI to release the wild-type human p53
cDNA and subcloned into the pcDNA5/TO (Invitrogen) tetracycline-inducible vector. Cet-R cells with stable expression
of the pcDNA6/TR were then transfected with pcDNA5/
TO-wt-hp53 using Effectene reagent. Colonies were then
selected and grown in 5 mg/mL blasticidin and 100 mg/mL
hygromycin. Stable transfected clones with high levels of p53
expression upon tetracycline induction were then pooled and
used in the experiments described later.
Immunocytochemical staining of DNA-pyruvate kinase
Cet-R cells were seeded on a glass chamber slide (Nalgene
Nunc). Following treatment, immunoﬂuorescent staining was
conducted as described in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Apoptosis assessment
Apoptosis was detected by ﬂow cytometry via examination
of altered plasma membrane phospholipid packing using
Annexin V/PI kit from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Detailed
information is provided in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Determination of cetuximab and radiation response in
human tumor xenografts
Athymic nude mice were obtained from Harlan Bioproducts
for science and maintained in a laminar airﬂow cabinet under
aseptic conditions. The care and treatment of experimental
animals was in accordance with institutional guidelines. Cet-R
cells with tetracycline-inducible p53 (1  106) were injected
subcutaneously into the dorsal ﬂank area of the mice. Tumor
volume was monitored by direct measurement with calipers
and calculated by the formula: p/6  (large diameter)  (small
diameter)2. When tumor size reached approximately 100 mm3,
mice were either fed with a regular diet or a regular diet
containing doxycycline at the end of experiment. The induction of p53 by doxycycline was validated by Western blotting
following extraction of proteins harvested from tumor specimens. Following the conﬁrmation of p53 induction, mice
were either treated with 2 mg/kg of cetuximab intraperitoneally twice weekly or 2 Gy of radiation twice weekly for
3 consecutive weeks.
Radiation survival
Survival following radiation exposure was deﬁned as the
ability of the cells to maintain their clonogenic capacity and
to form colonies. Brieﬂy, after exposure to radiation, cells were
trypsinized, counted, and seeded for colony formation in
35-mm dishes at 50 to 5,000 cells per dish. Following 14 to
21 days, colonies were stained with crystal violet and manually
counted. Colonies consisting of 50 cells or more were scored,
and 4 to 10 replicate dishes containing 10 to 150 colonies
per dish were counted for each treatment.

Results
Loss of p53 in EGFR inhibitor–resistant clones
We previously established acquired resistant clones to 2
distinct classes of EGFR inhibitor as a model system to
examine potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR
inhibitors (8). Following the development of Cet-R and erlotinib-resistant (Erl-R) clones of H226, we conducted a Westernbased high-throughput screening to compare the levels of
cellular signaling proteins between resistant and corresponding sensitive parental H226 cells (HP). This customized BD
PowerBlot Western Array applied antibodies to detect phosphorylated and total levels of 42 key cellular signaling proteins
which included EGFR-related extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK), AKT, c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK), and STAT3 signaling molecules. As highlighted in the images of the 2 PowerBlots in Fig. 1A, we found that several proteins levels and
activity showed signiﬁcant up- or downregulation in the Cet-R
cells when compared with HP cells. Figure 1B lists the proteins
with a greater than 2-fold change (up or down) in Cet-R with
level 10 conﬁdence following quantiﬁcation analysis as
described in Materials and Methods. We found that p53 was
the most profoundly downregulated and p-ERK1/2 the most

upregulated cellular signaling protein in Cet-R cells when
compared with parental HP cells. Similar results were found
in the Erl-R clones (Supplementary Fig. S1) derived from H226.
As p53 is a key molecule in regulating cellular radiation
response and has recently been shown to inﬂuence cetuximab
response, we validated the downregulation of p53 in another
established Cet-R line using conventional Western blotting.
Consistent with the PowerBlot results, we found that p53 was
signiﬁcantly reduced in Cet-R clones of H226 and SCC6 (Fig.
1C). This robust loss of p53 in not only all Cet-R clones, but also
in our Erl-R clones, led us to hypothesize that p53 may play an
important role in regulating acquired resistance to EGFR
inhibitors and radiation.
Silencing p53 in parental H226 cells reduces sensitivity to
cetuximab and radiation
To investigate the role of p53 in regulating acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation, we ﬁrst knocked down
p53 using siRNA in the H226 parental cells to examine the
resultant cetuximab and/or radiation response proﬁle. As
shown in Fig. 2A, p53 levels were signiﬁcantly reduced 48
hours following knockdown of p53. Thereafter, treatment with
cetuximab did not signiﬁcantly inhibit the growth of cells
without p53. In contrast, treatment with cetuximab in HP cells
with p53 resulted in signiﬁcant growth inhibition in a dosedependent manner. Similarly, we observed a signiﬁcant
decrease in the comet tail moment by neutral comet assay in
HP cells without p53 following radiation treatment (Fig. 2B).
Because neutral comet assay detects primarily double-

stranded DNA breaks, these results suggest that knockdown
of p53 in the sensitive parental HP cells induces resistance to
not only the EGFR inhibitor but also radiation. To further
explore this ﬁnding, we knocked down p53 in 2 cetuximabsensitive lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H292. Consistent with
our ﬁnding with H226, the sensitivity to cetuximab was signiﬁcantly reduced in these 2 cell lines following p53 knockdown,
as shown in Fig. 2C. These results suggest a role of p53 in
regulating tumor response to cetuximab.

Transfection of p53 enhances sensitivity to cetuximab
and radiation in Cet-R cells
Because p53 was lost when tumor cells acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation, we reconstituted
a functional p53 in these resistant cells to examine whether
the sensitivity to cetuximab and/or radiation could be
restored. Although, a single 1992 report noted a point mutation of p53 in codon 158 of exon 5 in H226 cells (15), we and
several other investigators have conﬁrmed the wild-type
status of p53 without a point mutation in codon 158 in the
H226 line (Supplementary Fig. S2; refs. 16–18). Therefore,
we transiently transfected a full-length wild-type p53 into
the Cet-R cells using a pC53-SN plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3,
a functional p53 exogenous gene was expressed 48 hours
following transfection as shown by the consistent upregula-

tion of p21. Using a cell proliferation assay, we observed
an increase of cetuximab sensitivity in the Cet-R clones
following p53 transfection as shown in Fig. 3A. The increased
growth inhibition of cetuximab in p53-transfected Cet-R
may result from induction of p21 that triggers cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis as described previously (19). Similarly,
using the comet analysis, we found enhancement of the
radiation-induced comet tail moments in Cet-R cells following restoration of p53 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that
Cet-R cells regain sensitivity to cetuximab and radiation
following reconstitution of a functional p53.

Radiation response of Cet-R clones with tetracyclineinducible p53
Although, there was a trend toward increased radiation
damage in Cet-R cells following transient transfection with
p53, the difference as manifested by the comet assay was not
statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 3B). We generated a stable Cet-R
clone with a tetracycline-inducible p53 system (T-REx) that
allowed for examination of cetuximab and radiation response
in both culture and animal model systems. As shown in Fig. 4A,
p53 in the Cet-R cells with the T-REx system could be induced
1 day after tetracycline treatment. Thereafter, p53 expression
was maintained once tetracycline was present in the medium
up to day 2. Furthermore, p53 was lost once tetracycline

As expected (Fig. 4B), DNA-PK was induced by radiation in a
dose-dependent manner in the original Cet-R cells. However,
DNA-PK expression was further enhanced when p53 was
induced by tetracycline in these Cet-R cells. A signiﬁcant
difference in DNA-PK expression was observed between the
original and p53-induced Cet-R cells when they were exposed
to 6 Gy radiation. To conﬁrm this observation, we conducted
immunocytochemical staining to detect DNA-PK in individual
cells. We found a consistent enhancement of DNA-PK expression in the p53-induced Cet-R cells following 6 Gy radiation
exposure as shown in Fig. 4C. These results indicate that
radiation-induced DNA damage is increased in the Cet-R cells
when p53 is reintroduced.
To further examine the role of p53 in regulating radiation
response in Cet-R cells, we evaluated the radiosensitivity of
Cet-R with or without p53 using clonogenic survival analysis.
As shown in Fig. 5A, Cet-R cells with p53 showed a lower
survival rate than cells without p53 following exposure to 3, 6,
or 9 Gy radiation. The enhanced cell death in these Cet-R cells
with p53 was further conﬁrmed by evaluating the apoptosis
proﬁle of tumor cells following radiation treatment. As shown
in Fig. 5B, treatment with radiation resulted in a signiﬁcant
induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the
Cet-R cells with p53 but not in cells without p53. Taken
together, these results indicate that Cet-R cells with restoration
of p53 manifest enhanced radiosensitivity, possibly by facilitating the induction of apoptosis.
Restoration of p53 restores cetuximab and radiation
sensitivity in Cet-R tumor xenografts
Following the establishment of a stable Cet-R clone with
tetracycline-inducible p53, we then inoculated these cells into
athymic mice to investigate the role of p53 in regulating
resistance to cetuximab and radiation in vivo. When tumors

expression in the mice receiving a regular diet. Following the

However, tumors in the doxycycline-treated mice showed
profound tumor regression following the same treatment with
cetuximab. Indeed, tumors in the doxycycline-treated mice
showed 5-fold volume reduction compared with Cet-treated

p53 Regulates Acquired Resistance to Cetuximab

indicate that restoration of p53 can restore sensitivity to
cetuximab and radiation in Cet-R cells. In conjunction with
the previous study that used transient transfection of p53
(Fig. 3), this animal xenograft model, with a stable p53-inducible tumor, provides additional evidence supporting a key
role for p53 in regulating cetuximab and radiation response.

Discussion
The development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors
is emerging as a potential treatment barrier for the optimization of EGFR-targeted therapy. Similar to the development
of acquired resistance to other molecular targeting agents,
such as imatinib (Gleevec), acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors also exhibits cross-resistance to other therapeutic cancer drugs and radiation (20). To explore underlying mechanisms for acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation,
we screened for differences in the expression and activity of
42 key cellular signaling proteins between EGFR inhibitor–
resistant cells and their corresponding parental cells. Surprisingly, we found a robust loss of p53 in all resistant clones.
This consistent loss of p53 in the resistant clones to 2 distinct
classes of EGFR-targeting agents drew our attention to investigate the role of p53 in regulating acquired resistance to EGFR
inhibitors and radiation. Using 2 different approaches to
either knockdown p53 in the parental cells or restore functional p53 in the resistant cells, we found that the response to
cetuximab and radiation can be regulated following manipulation of p53 expression. In addition, we found that p53 may
affect response to EGFR inhibitors and radiation via regulation
of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. These
results suggest that p53 plays a central role in regulating
acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation.
p53 is a tumor suppressor known to suppress cancer progression through the induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis,
or senescence in response to a variety of cellular stimuli.
Hence, loss of p53 function in cells, either through mutation
or posttranslational modiﬁcation, might therefore be expected
to lead to unchecked proliferation, tumor growth, and therapeutic resistance (21, 22). A substantial number of clinical and
preclinical studies identify an association of p53 mutation
with poor prognosis and drug resistance (17, 23) for a variety
of malignancies. In breast and colorectal tumors, p53 mutations are reported to predict resistance to a host of chemotherapeutic drugs including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-ﬂuorouracil (24, 25). In contrast, reports have indicated that the
expression of wild-type p53 is required for the efﬁcacy of
radiation and chemotherapy.
In addition to DNA-damaging drugs and radiation, increasing evidence indicates the importance of p53 in regulating the
response to several molecular-targeted agents, including EGFR
inhibitors. Previous studies showing that cetuximab inhibits
the growth of wild-type p53, but not mutated p53, cancer cells
fostered the hypothesis that resistance to cetuximab may
relate to p53 mutation (26). In addition, studies reported that
geﬁtinib induced apoptosis through a p53-dependent signaling
pathway and p53 mutation in combination with p21 expression in colorectal cancer was a predictor of resistance to

www.aacrjournals.org

geﬁtinib (27, 28). By comparing cell lines with different levels
of p53, Rho and colleagues reported that the NSCLC H1299 cell
line with a p53-null genotype was more resistant to geﬁtinib
than cells with wild-type p53 expression. Interestingly, following tetracycline-inducible transfection of p53, no signiﬁcant
change in cell growth doubling time and morphology was
observed in H1299 cells. However, restoration of p53 enhanced
the sensitivity to geﬁtinib via induction of Fas-regulated apoptosis (29). Consistent with these ﬁndings, we found that
restoration of functional p53 in our Cet-R cells did not induce
cell-cycle arrest but did induce apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S3). In addition, we found that apoptosis plays an important role in regulating the response to EGFR inhibitor and
radiation in p53-transfected Cet-R cells (Fig. 5B). However, our
model cannot exclude the possible role of p53-induced cellcycle arrest in regulating acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Indeed, several different mechanisms have been suggested using distinct tumor types/models following restoration of p53 in recent studies. Ventura and colleagues showed
that restoration of p53 induced apoptotic cell death in lymphoma but cell-cycle arrest and senescence in sarcoma (30).
Xue and colleagues found that p53 induction in their hepatocarcinoma model led to growth arrest with senescence rather
than apoptotic cell death (31). Hence, further studies with
additional cell lines and model systems will be required to
clarify the underlying mechanism of p53 in regulating acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors and radiation.
Although cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis are traditionally
thought of as the major functions of p53 for tumor suppression,
increasing evidence indicates that p53 may also impact signaling pathways that are involved in cell growth and transformation, including the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways. It has
been shown that the ERK pathway regulates the transcriptional function and subcellular localization of p53 (32). A
recent report showed that mutant p53 initiated a feedback
loop that involves ERK-mediated transcription of early growth
response-1 (Egr-1), which in turn increased the secretion of
EGFR ligands with stimulation of EGFR signaling (33). Additional data showed that doxorubicin resistance was associated with decreased p53 and activated ERK signaling in
leukemias (34). Beyond ERK, studies also indicate that p53
was involved in the regulation of survival PI3K/AKT pathway,
as induction of p53 resulted in decreased AKT activity in
epithelial tumors (35, 36). Using nonviral gene transfer of
p53 in PC3 prostate tumor cells, Bouali and colleagues also
found a signiﬁcant inhibition of AKT and ERK pathway following p53 transfection (37). In addition, exposure of p53-transfected cells to cetuximab further inhibited these 2 pathways.
Consistent with these observations, we found a signiﬁcant
upregulation of p-ERK along with p53 loss in our Cet-R cells
(Fig. 1). Following p53 transfection, a signiﬁcant decrease of
p-ERK was observed (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results
suggest that p53 may regulate sensitivity to EGFR inhibitor by
modulating EGFR downstream signaling functionality and
apoptosis induction. These ﬁndings also support our observation that loss of p53 in EGFR inhibitor–resistant cells
associates with resistance to EGFR inhibitor and restoration
of functional p53 can reestablish sensitivity to EGFR inhibitor.

Interestingly, a recent correlative clinical study suggested
that p53 mutations predict response and not resistance to
cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer. Oden-Gangloff
and colleagues assessed tumor specimens from 64 patients
with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer
who were treated with cetuximab-based chemotherapy (38).
They unexpectedly found an association between p53 mutations and improved clinical outcome, particularly in patients
without KRAS mutations. Variable data about the association of p53 mutations with EGFR inhibitor response highlight
the complexity of p53 mutations. Unlike conventional tumor
suppressors that are typically affected by nonsense frameshift
mutations, some 80% of p53 mutations found in tumors are
missense mutations (39). These mutations may encode oncogenic activities that are distinct from wild-type and simple
dominant-negative variants. The association between speciﬁc
p53 mutations and drug resistance has been explored (40, 41).
However, it remains unclear which property of mutant p53,
such as loss of wild-type p53 function, the acquisition of
dominant-negative properties, the gain of new oncogenic
function, or perhaps a combination of the above, is primarily
involved in drug response and resistance. Therefore, it remains
important to examine the impact of different p53 mutations
among a wide spectrum of tumor samples to sharpen our
understanding of p53 mutation in relation to treatment
response. Nonetheless, our study suggests an important role
of p53 in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor cells
with wild-type p53. By examining changes in p53 from cells
with the same p53 genotype, our resistant clones provide a
simple platform to further investigate the role of p53 in
regulating acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. To further
extrapolate the applicability of these results to human tumors,
it would be valuable to identify a cohort of patients that
manifest acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy and
evaluate the p53 status of their tumors before the commencement of EGFR inhibitor therapy and at the time of disease
progression during therapy.
Acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors presents a clinical
problem not only because of the development of resistance to

EGFR molecular–targeting agents but also because of potential manifestation of resistance to other drug or treatment
modalities. Data from the current study suggest that the loss
of p53 contributes to acquired resistance to both EGFR inhibitors and radiation. Hence, restoring p53 may provide a
valuable treatment strategy for tumors that manifest EGFR
inhibitor resistance. Several approaches to restore functional
p53 are in various stages of development (22). Efforts to
restore p53 function include viral delivery of the wild-type
p53 gene to cancer cells, restoration of wild-type function
to mutant p53, inhibition of p53 degradation, and activation of other p53 family members to substitute for mutant
p53 and the resulting loss of wild-type p53 (22, 42). Although
there remain many challenges, our current study may stimulate interest to apply p53 restoration approaches to enhance
the efﬁcacy of EGFR therapy and radiation.
In conclusion, we provide experimental evidence showing a
profound loss of p53 during the development of acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that
knockdown of wild-type p53 can increase resistance to EGFR
inhibitors and radiation, whereas reconstitution of functional
p53 sensitizes tumor cells to both treatments. Our acquired
EGFR inhibitor–resistant clones provide a valuable resource to
further examine the role of p53 in EGFR-targeting therapy.
Results from current study also suggest opportunities for
future clinical treatment strategies that incorporate EGFR–
radiation combinations.
