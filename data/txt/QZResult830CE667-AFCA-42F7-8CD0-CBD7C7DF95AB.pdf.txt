Summary

Author Manuscript

Prostate cancer resistance to castration occurs because tumors acquire the metabolic capability of
converting precursor steroids to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), promoting signaling by the
androgen receptor (AR) and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)1–3.
Essential for resistance, DHT synthesis from adrenal precursor steroids or possibly from de novo
synthesis from cholesterol commonly require enzymatic reactions by 3β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (3βHSD), steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
(17βHSD) isoenzymes4,5. Abiraterone, a steroidal 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1)
inhibitor, blocks this synthetic process and prolongs survival6,7. We hypothesized that abiraterone
is converted by an enzyme to the more active Δ4-abiraterone (D4A) that blocks multiple
steroidogenic enzymes and antagonizes the androgen receptor (AR), providing an additional
explanation for abiraterone’s clinical activity. Here we show that abiraterone is converted to D4A
in mice and patients with prostate cancer. D4A inhibits CYP17A1, 3βHSD and SRD5A, which are
required for DHT synthesis. Furthermore, competitive AR antagonism by D4A is comparable to
the potent antagonist, enzalutamide. D4A also has more potent antitumor activity against
xenograft tumors than abiraterone. Our findings suggest an additional explanation – conversion to

a more active agent – for abiraterone’s survival extension. We propose that direct treatment with
D4A would be more clinically effective than abiraterone treatment.

Author Manuscript

The central role and critical requirement for androgen metabolism and AR in CRPC are
demonstrated by the clinical benefit and overall survival benefit conferred by abiraterone
(Abi)6,7, which blocks CYP17A1, an enzyme required for androgen synthesis, and
enzalutamide, which potently and competitively blocks the AR8,9. Abi (administered in its
acetate form for bioavailability) is a steroidal compound and is therefore potentially subject
to conversion by steroid-metabolizing enzymes. We hypothesized the Δ5, 3β-hydroxylstructure of Abi, which is also present in the natural steroid substrates
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and Δ5-androstenediol (A5diol), makes it susceptible to
one enzyme conversion by 3βHSD isoenzymes to its Δ4, 3-keto congener (Δ4-abiraterone or
D4A), which would make the steroid A and B rings identical to testosterone (T), enabling
inhibitory interactions with AR and additional steroidogenic enzymes, including SRD5A,
which are required for DHT synthesis (Fig. 1a). Such a conversion in peripheral tissues
would allow D4A to engage with multiple targets to potentiate its effects on the androgen
pathway, providing an alternative explanation for the clinical efficacy of Abi therapy and
thus the possibility that direct treatment might be more efficacious.

Author Manuscript

We found that D4A is detectable in the sera of mice administered Abi acetate (Fig. 1b), as
well as in sera from patients with CRPC who were undergoing treatment with Abi acetate
(Fig. 1c, 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1). In the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line, which
usually has low 3βHSD activity3, conversion of Abi to D4A is detectable only if 3βHSD is
overexpressed (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2a–b). Other tissues such as the mouse
adrenal (but not mouse prostate) that have robust endogenous 3βHSD enzymatic activity
also convert Abi to D4A (Extended Data Fig. 2c). These results suggest that D4A is a major
metabolite of Abi, requires 3βHSD for conversion, and may confer effects on the tumor that
are indirectly due to Abi.

Author Manuscript

D4A may impinge on multiple steps in the androgen pathway, including CYP17A1, 3βHSD,
SRD5A and direct interaction with AR (Fig. 2a). Although augmented Abi drug exposure
may block 3βHSD, normal dosing probably does not10. On the other hand, D4A is
approximately 10-fold more potent than Abi at blocking the conversion of [3H]-DHEA by
3βHSD to Δ4-androstenedione (AD) in LNCaP and VCaP cells, as assessed by thin layer
chromatography (TLC; Extended Data Fig. 3a) and high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC; Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3b). D4A inhibits both human
isoenzymes, 3βHSD1 and 3βHSD2, with mixed inhibition kinetics (Fig. 2c). CYP17A1
inhibition is the major direct mechanism of action for Abi11. Structural studies of modified
steroidal azoles suggest that the A-ring conformation of D4A does not significantly perturb
binding to CYP17A112. D4A and Abi similarly block conversion of [3H]-pregnenolone by
CYP17A1 to DHEA (% conversion to DHEA after 3 h incubation for vehicle, 1 nM D4A
and 1 nM Abi is 70.1%, 4.2% and 2.6%, respectively) by HPLC in intact 293 cells
expressing CYP17A1 (Fig. 2d). The Δ4, 3-keto-structure of D4A is identical to physiologic
SRD5A substrates, such as T and AD (Fig. 1a)13. To determine the effect of D4A on
endogenously expressed SRD5A, LAPC4 cells, which exhibit robust SRD5A enzymatic

activity13 were treated with D4A, Abi or enzalutamide, and cultured in the presence of [3H]AD (the preferred natural substrate of SRD5A113). D4A (10μM) nearly completely blocks
conversion from AD to 5α-androstanedione and other 5α-reduced androgens, whereas Abi
and enzalutamide have no detectable effect even at a concentration of 100 μM (Fig. 2e).

Abi has been reported to have modest affinity for AR, particularly in the presence of
mutations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD)14. Conversion of Abi by 3βHSD to D4A
would provide a 3-keto structure, which is shared with both T and DHT, steroids with the
highest affinity for AR (Fig. 1a). To determine how conversion from Abi to the 3-keto
structure of D4A affects drug affinity for AR, we performed a competition assay. The
affinity of D4A for mutant (expressed in LNCaP, IC50 = 5.3 nM) and wild-type (expressed
in LAPC4, IC50 = 7.9 nM) AR is greater than that of Abi (IC50 = 418 and > 500 nM,
respectively), comparable to or slightly greater than that of enzalutamide (IC50 = 24 and 23
nM, respectively, Fig. 3a–b), and clearly greater than bicalutamide, which was the most
potent competitive nonsteroidal AR antagonist prior to the introduction of enzalutamide
(Extended Data Fig. 4a–b). The affinity of D4A for the AR LBD translates to inhibition of
DHT-induced AR chromatin occupancy on the PSA, TMPRSS2 and FKBP5 regulatory
elements on chromatin, which is superior to Abi (Extended Data Fig. 4c) and somewhat
lower than enzalutamide (Fig. 3c). The incongruity between AR affinity and effects on
chromatin occupancy for D4A and enzalutamide is consistent with combined AR
antagonism and chromatin binding in an inactive complex as previously reported for some
AR antagonists15.

Author Manuscript

We next examined the cumulative results of the effects of D4A on androgen-responsive
gene expression. Compared to Abi, D4A clearly better suppresses PSA, TMPRSS2 and
FKBP5 expression induced by DHT, DHEA and R1881 in LNCAP, LAPC4 and C4-2 cell
lines (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5a and 5c). D4A inhibits AR target gene expression in
a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 5b and 5d). Comparisons of D4A to
enzalutamide on DHT-induced endogenous PSA expression demonstrate that D4A is
equivalent to enzalutamide against mutant and wild-type AR (Fig. 3e–f and Extended Data
Fig. 5c–d). Downstream of androgen-responsive gene expression, effects of D4A and
enzalutamide on DHT-stimulated cell growth are equivalent (Fig. 3g), both of which are
more potent than Abi.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether the observed effects of D4A on inhibition of steroid synthesis
demonstrated in tissue culture also occur in tumors, effects in two prostate cancer xenograft
models with robust 3βHSD enzymatic activity3 were assessed. Subcutaneous mouse
xenograft tumors of VCaP and LNCaP cells, which both harbor a mutant gene encoding a
missense in 3βHSD1 that effectively increases enzyme activity3, were grown in male NSG
mice. Fresh tumors were harvested, minced and incubated with [3H]-DHEA plus Abi or
D4A (0.1–10 μM). Similar to effects shown in Fig. 2, D4A is 10-fold more potent than Abi
in blocking conversion from DHEA by 3βHSD to AD in LNCaP (Fig. 4a) and VCaP
xenografts (Fig. 4b). For example, 0.1 μM D4A is equivalent to 1 μM Abi for blocking AD
accumulation at 48 hr in both LNCaP and VCaP xenografts. To test whether the combined
effects of D4A on inhibition of steroid synthesis and direct blockade of AR lead to
augmented anti-tumor activity compared with Abi, VCaP xenografts were grown

subcutaneously in orchiectomized mice with DHEA pellet implantation (to mimic human
adrenal physiology; Fig. 4c). Time from initiation of treatment with D4A, Abi acetate or
vehicle, to tumor progression (> 20% increase in tumor volume) was assessed by generating
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and comparing treatment groups with the log-rank test.
Progression was significantly delayed in the D4A group compared to the Abi acetate group
(P = 0.011). Fold-change in tumor volume is shown for each treatment group in Extended
Data Fig. 6. We also compared xenograft growth using the same method with the C4-2 cell
line model. D4A treatment increased progression-free survival compared to Abi acetate and
enzalutamide (Fig. 4d). In serum collected from D4A treated mice at the end of the
xenograft study there was no detectable increase in deoxycorticosterone, which is the
mineralocorticoid that is most highly elevated in patients treated with Abi acetate, causing
hypertension and hyperkalemia (Extended Data Fig. 7)6,16. Fig. 4e depicts the multiple
points in the androgen pathway at which conversion of Abi by 3βHSD to D4A in patients
impinges on AR signaling and prostate cancer progression, and the relative potencies of
D4A, Abi and enzalutamide.

Author Manuscript

The next-generation hormonal therapies, Abi and enzalutamide, each have a single
predominant target (CYP17A1 and AR, respectively). These drugs have clinically validated
that androgen synthesis and AR stimulation are both essential components required to spur
the development and progression of CRPC. After oral administration, Abi acetate is
hydrolyzed and thereby converted to Abi, which is thought to be the major active agent by
way of blocking CYP17A1. The major recognized metabolites of Abi result from hepatic
CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 processing, forming the N-oxide of Abi and Abi sulfate,
respectively. Neither of these modifications affects the Δ5, 3β-hydroxyl-structure of the
steroid backbone. In contrast, conversion to D4A modifies the steroidal structure to one that
more robustly engages with AR, SRD5A and 3βHSD, thereby blocking androgen signaling
at all these steps, while retaining CYP17A1 inhibition. The clinical significance of
conversion of Abi to D4A and effects on individual components of the androgen pathway in
patients must be viewed in light of pharmacokinetic studies which show a Cmax of
approximately 1 μM and also wide interpatient variability16. Furthermore, our findings
suggest that D4A also has much more potent anti-tumor activity against CRPC when
directly compared to Abi.

Author Manuscript

The potential clinical utility of treating CRPC patients directly with D4A is dependent on
the underlying mechanisms of resistance to Abi, which have not been fully elucidated and
the clinical settings in which the benefit from Abi is exhausted. The evidence suggests that
sustained AR signaling characterizes at least a subset of Abi resistance cases. For example,
increased AR copy number in CRPC is associated with absence of clinical response to Abi17
and increased AR protein expression appears to occur upon the development of acquired
clinical resistance to Abi18. Although Abi is a potent CYP17A1 inhibitor, studies of urinary
steroid metabolites in patients demonstrate that androgen synthesis inhibition is incomplete,
raising the possibility of sustained steroidogenesis as a mechanism of resistance5,19.
Clinically, the combination of CYP17A1 inhibition and a potent AR antagonist appears to
confer more potent androgen signaling inhibition in patients with CRPC20.

Circulating concentrations of D4A in patients treated with Abi acetate appear to be quite
variable. In contrast to hepatic Abi metabolites, it is probable that conversion of Abi to D4A
in peripheral tissues leads to D4A concentrations that are higher in peripheral tissues (such
as CRPC) than are present in serum. The effects of D4A on androgen signaling in CRPC, in
particular distal steps in DHT synthesis and activity as an AR antagonist, may therefore be
underestimated based on serum concentrations alone. Nonetheless, D4A levels in peripheral
tissues and the precise contribution of D4A to the clinical activity of Abi have yet to be
determined.

Author Manuscript

Finally, our results raise the possibility that there may be a previously unappreciated class
effect of steroidal versus nonsteroidal CYP17A1 inhibitors. In contrast to Abi acetate,
TAK-700, a nonsteroidal CYP17A1 inhibitor, failed to prolong survival in metastatic
CRPC21. It is possible that the absence of active downstream steroidal metabolites may have
contributed to these findings. This issue should be considered as other steroidal and
nonsteroidal CYP17A1 inhibitors undergo further clinical investigation.
In conclusion, we have identified a novel Abi metabolite that is present in patients with
CRPC treated with Abi acetate and has more potent anti-tumor activity than the parent drug.
Conversion to D4A may be responsible for some of the clinical activity observed with the
use of Abi. We suggest that treatment with D4A is likely to result in a greater clinical
benefit than Abi.

Male NSG mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic Biological
Resources Unit facility. All mouse studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the
Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sample size was
determined based on our prior studies of steroidogenesis inhibition in xenograft models of
CRPC3,13. Criteria for progression were determined based on similar criteria that are utilized
for clinical progression. Mice were surgically orchiectomized and implanted with a 5 mg 90day sustained-release DHEA pellet (Innovative Research of America) to mimic CRPC in the
context of human adrenal physiology. Two days later, 107 VCaP or C4-2 cells were injected
subcutaneously with matrigel. Once tumors reached 300 mm3 (length × width × height ×
0.52), mice were arbitrarily (but not strictly randomized) assigned to vehicle (n=9 or 10
mice for VCaP and C4-2 respectively), Abi acetate (n=10 mice for both cell lines), D4A
(n=10 mice for both cell lines) or enzalutamide (n=11 for C4-2) treatment groups. Abi
acetate and D4A (0.5 mmol/kg/d in 0.1 mL 5% benzyl alcohol and 95% safflower oil
solution) were administered via 5 mL/kg intraperitoneal injection every day for up to 15
days. Control groups were administered 0.1 mL 5% benzyl alcohol and 95% safflower oil
solution via intraperitoneal injection every day. Mice in enzalutamide group were fed with
enzalutamide in chow every day (10mg/Kg/day)25. Treatment was not blinded to the
investigator. Tumor volume was measured daily, and time to increase in tumor volume by
20% was determined. Mice were sacrificed at treatment day 15 or when the tumor size was
2-fold greater than baseline. The significance of the difference between treatment groups
was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using a log-rank test in SigmaStat 3.5. Twotailed student’s t-test was used to determine significance in Extended Data Fig. 6.
Enzyme assays

To test D4A as an inhibitor of 3βHSD, enzyme assays were performed as described
previously10. Briefly, incubations were prepared with recombinant human 3βHSD1 or
3βHSD2 (in yeast microsomes, 45 or 2.5 μg protein per incubation, respectively), [3H]pregnenolone (100,000 cpm, 1–20 μmol/L), and D4A (5–20 μmol/L) or ethanol vehicle in
0.5 mL of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After a pre-incubation at 37°C for 1 to 3
min, NAD+ (1 mmol/L) was added, and the incubation was conducted at 37°C for 20 min.
The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mL ethyl acetate:isooctane (1:1), and the steroids

LNCaP cells (0.1 million/mL) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured in phenol red free
RPMI-1640 mediums plus 10% charcoal stripped FBS with androgens and/or drugs.
Medium was changed every other day. After 2, 4 or 6 days, cells were collected and lysed
after treatment. Growth was then determined based on DNA content as detected by Hoechst

Patient serum collection and drug extraction—Twelve patients with CRPC
undergoing treatment with Abi acetate were consented under an Institutional Review Board
– approved protocol (Case 7813). Blood was collected using Vacutainer Plus serum blood
collection tubes (#BD367814, Becton Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Blood was collected
between 2 and 14 hours after the 1000mg daily dose of Abi acetate was administered. Blood
was allowed to clot and tubes were centrifuged at 2500 RPM for 10 minutes. Serum aliquots
were frozen at −80°C until processing. Drug metabolites and internal standard (d4-cortisol,
CDN isotopes Pointe-Claire, Quebec Canada) were extracted from 200 μL of patient serum
with methyl tert-butyl ether (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), evaporated under a stream of
nitrogen gas and reconstituted in methanol prior to mass spectrometry analysis.
Mouse serum collection, derivatization and extraction—At the completion of the
mouse xenograft study, mouse serum was collected for steroid analysis. 20 μl of serum and
internal standard (d8-deoxycorticosterone) was derivatized with hydroxylamine (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)26. Steroids were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas and reconstituted in

D4A binds to AR, inhibits AR chromatin occupancy, expression of AR-responsive genes
and cell growth. a and b, D4A potently binds to both mutant and wild-type AR. D4A, Abi
and enzalutamide (Enz) (0.001–10 μM) were used to compete with 0.1nM [3H]-R1881 for
mutated AR (LNCaP) or wild type AR (LAPC4). Intracellular radioactivity was normalized
to protein concentration. c, Dose-dependence of D4A versus Enz for inhibition of AR
chromatin occupancy. LNCaP cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of DHT,
D4A, and Enz for 3h. AR chromatin occupancy for PSA, TMPRSS2 and FKBP5 was
detected with ChIP. AR ChIP is normalized to untreated control for each gene. d, D4A
inhibits PSA, FKBP5 and TMPRSS2 expression. LNCaP cells were treated with DHT (0.5
nM), DHEA (40 nM) or R1881 (0.1 nM) with or without Abi or D4A (1μM) for 24h. Gene
expression was detected by qPCR and normalized to RPLP0. e and f, D4A inhibition of
DHT induced PSA expression is comparable to Enz in LNCaP and LAPC4. g, D4A inhibits
DHT (0.5 nM) induced cell growth in LNCaP. Cells were quantified at the indicated time
points by assaying DNA content after 2, 4 and 6 days of treatment. Experiments in a, b and g
