Abstract
Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins, inﬂuence tumor progression by modulating interactions
between tumor, endothelial, stromal, and immune cells. Despite considerable progress in identifying the roles
of individual galectins in tumor biology, an integrated portrait of the galectin network in different tumor
microenvironments is still missing. We undertook this study to analyze the "galectin signature" of the human
prostate cancer microenvironment with the overarching goal of selecting novel-molecular targets for prognostic
and therapeutic purposes. In examining androgen-responsive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells and
primary tumors representing different stages of the disease, we found that galectin-1 (Gal-1) was the most
abundantly expressed galectin in prostate cancer tissue and was markedly upregulated during disease progression. In contrast, all other galectins were expressed at lower levels: Gal-3, -4, -9, and -12 were downregulated during
disease evolution, whereas expression of Gal-8 was unchanged. Given the prominent regulation of Gal-1 during
prostate cancer progression and its predominant localization at the tumor-vascular interface, we analyzed the
potential role of this endogenous lectin in prostate cancer angiogenesis. In human prostate cancer tissue arrays,
Gal-1 expression correlated with the presence of blood vessels, particularly in advanced stages of the disease.
Silencing Gal-1 in prostate cancer cells reduced tumor vascularization without altering expression of other
angiogenesis-related genes. Collectively, our ﬁndings identify a dynamically regulated "galectin-speciﬁc signature" that accompanies disease evolution in prostate cancer, and they highlight a major role for Gal-1 as a tractable
target for antiangiogenic therapy in advanced stages of the disease. Cancer Res; 73(1); 86–96. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men,
and represents a signiﬁcant cause of mortality worldwide (1).
Localized prostate cancer is efﬁciently treated by association of
surgery with radiotherapy and androgen ablation. However,
prostate cancer evolves toward stages in which tumor cells
acquire properties allowing their distant dissemination (2) and
castration-resistant growth (3). No current treatments are

Galectin Signature of Human Prostate Cancer

postgenomic era, the study of the glycome has enabled the
association of speciﬁc glycan structures with the transition
from normal to neoplastic tissue (4, 5). The function of deciphering the biologic information encoded by the glycome is assigned
to endogenous glycan-binding proteins or lectins, whose
expression and function are regulated during tumor progression (5). Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins, play
pivotal roles as regulators of tumor biology by directly inﬂuencing tumor transformation, invasiveness, angiogenesis, and
tumor-immune escape (6, 7). These lectins are deﬁned by a
common structural fold and a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that recognizes N- and O-glycans expressing the disaccharide N-acetyllactosamine (Gal-b(1–4)-GlcNAc),
although differences in glycan-binding preferences of individual members of the family have been reported (7). Galectins that
are traditionally classiﬁed as "proto-type" (Gal-1, -2, -5, -7, -10,
-11, -13, -14, and -15) have 1 CRD that can dimerize, whereas
"tandem-repeat" galectins (Gal-4, -6, -8, -9, and -12) contain 2
homologous CRDs in tandem in a single polypeptide chain. Gal3 is unique in that it contains a CRD connected to a non-lectin
N-terminal region that is responsible for oligomerization (7).
Extracellularly, galectins interact with cell surface glycoconjugates and trigger cellular signaling to control migration, immunity, and angiogenesis. Intracellularly, galectins can control
tumor transformation, proliferation, and survival (7, 8).
Previous studies have identiﬁed galectins as key components of the prostate cancer microenvironment (9–11). Expression of galectin-1 (Gal-1) controls the differentiation and
survival of prostate cancer cells (9, 12) and inhibits T-cell
transmigration (13). On the other hand, Gal-3 controls homotypic and heterotypic aggregation of prostate cancer cells (14–
16) and controls their viability (17). Tumor cell expression of
Gal-3 has been proposed to delineate the transition from
benign stages to castration-resistant malignant disease (18)
and its regulated expression is associated with promoter
methylation (19). Silencing Gal-3 results in decreased migration, invasion, and proliferation of prostate cancer cells (20).
Moreover, Gal-8, which was originally identiﬁed as prostate
cancer tumor antigen 1 (PCTA1; ref. 21), can modulate integrin-mediated cell–extracellular matrix interactions (22). However, despite considerable progress in dissecting the functions
of individual members of the galectin family, there is still no
integrated portrait of the "galectin signature" of the human
prostate cancer microenvironment.
Our ﬁndings identify a unique galectin expression proﬁle,
which delineates different stages of prostate cancer progression. From all galectins analyzed, Gal-1 is uniquely expressed at
high levels in human prostate cancer and contributes to tumor
progression by promoting neovascularization. These results
underscore the importance of Gal-1 as an attractive therapeutic target in advanced stages of prostate cancer.

None of these patients received preoperative therapy. Protocols were approved by the Local Ethics Committee (Hospital de
Clínicas "Jose de San Martín", Buenos Aires, Argentina).
Cells and animals
Human prostate cancer cell lines used included: the hormone-responsive LNCaP cell line and the castration-resistant
cell lines 22Rv1 and PC-3 with or without androgen receptor
(AR) expression, respectively. The LNCaP and 22Rv1 cell lines
were provided by A. Chauchereau (Institute Gustave Roussy,
Villejuif, France). LNCaP cells were also provided by E. Vazquez. These cell lines were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell morphology was evaluated
by microscopic examination on a daily basis. Growth properties of LNCaP cells were regularly tested through their responsiveness to androgens using MTT assay. Cells were incubated
for 24 hours in phenol red-free RPMI, 10% charcoal-treated
serum and medium was supplemented with 1010 mol/L R1881
(AR agonist) for 3 days before analyzing growth and gene
expression. Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) induction was
evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR). Routine tests for 22Rv1 cells included examination
of androgen-insensitive growth (MTT method) and PSA induction by R1881 (real-time RT-PCR). The PC-3 cell line was
provided by E. Vazquez. Growth of these cells was routinely
tested for androgen sensitivity and the AR and PSA phenotypes
by real-time RT-PCR. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC)

were provided by M.T. Elola. BAEC were tested for their ability to
form tubular structures in the presence of VEGF. Each cell line
was routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination by genomic
PCR. LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI and
BAEC were cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium.
Medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS
(PAA, Cell Culture, Austria), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 mg/mL
streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin. BAEC were used at
passage 14 or less. For some experiments, 22Rv1 cells (50,000)
were plated into 12-well plates, cultured for 2 days under normal
oxygen supply, and then exposed to hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic conditions for an additional 15 hours. Nude mice were
obtained from The National University of La Plata (La Plata,
Argentina) and maintained in accordance with the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines (IBYME, Buenos
Aires, Argentina).
Reagents
The following anti-galectin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used: rabbit anti-Gal-1 (H-45), anti-Gal-8 (H80), anti-Gal-3 (H-160), anti-Gal-4 (T-20), anti-Gal-12 (H-166),
and goat anti-Gal-9 (C-20) antibodies. A puriﬁed anti-Gal-1
polyclonal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) generated in G.A.
Rabinovich's laboratory was used (23, 24). Anti-human carbonic anhydrase IX polyclonal antibody (H-120) was obtained
from Santa Cruz. Media and trypsin/EDTA were obtained from
Gibco-Invitrogen (Life Technologies). Blocking anti-Gal-1
monoclonal antibody (mAb; F8.G7) was generated and validated as described (25, 26). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel
was obtained from BD Biosciences.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was conducted on parafﬁn-embedded tissue samples. Samples were deparafﬁnized by 5-minute
incubation in xylene, 100%, 95%, and 75% ethanol. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched by 10-minute incubation
with 1% H2O2. Nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked using normal
horse serum in 0.05% saponin. Samples were incubated with
the appropriate antibodies at the optimal dilutions for 1 hour
at room temperature. The following antibodies were used:
polyclonal anti-Gal antibodies and preimmune sera from Santa
Cruz (1:200 dilution) and puriﬁed anti-Gal-1 rabbit IgG
(1:1,500). Immunoreactions were developed using the avidin–biotin-peroxidase Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector). Galectin
expression was graded as follows: 0 (negative); 1þ (poor
intensity); 2þ (moderate intensity); 3þ (high intensity), and
4þ (very high intensity). Prostate cancer cell lines were
adhered to poly-L-lysine (Sigma)–coated coverslips for 2 hours
at 37 C (50,000 cells per coverslip), ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes, and processed for immunocytochemistry as described for tissues.
Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays was conducted using 4-mm thick formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded
sections of tissue microarray slides containing 29 paired cores
(2 different areas of each single tumor from 29 tumors
analyzed) of invasive prostate cancer (BC19013; US
Biomax; Table 2). Slides were soaked in xylene and passed
through graded alcohols and distilled water before use. Slides

were then pretreated with citrate buffer pH 6.0 (Invitrogen) in a
steam pressure cooker (Decloaking Chamber CD2008US, Biocare Biomedical) according to manufacturers' recommended
settings (127 C for 30 seconds, followed by 90 C). Slides were
blocked for peroxidase activity using a speciﬁc blocker (DAKO)
and washed for 5 minutes in buffer. Individual slides were
incubated with a mouse anti-human CD34 mAb (clone QBEND10, RTU, Immunotech) and a rabbit anti-human Gal-1 polyclonal antibody (1:10,000) generated and used as described (23,
24). After 1 hour incubation, slides were washed and processed
by the appropriate Envisionþ Kit (DAKO) as per manufacturer's instructions, developed using a 3,30 -diaminobenzidine
(DAB) chromogen (DAKO) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Stained slides were digitally scanned using Aperio ScanScope XT workstation at the 20 setting (Aperio Technology,
Inc.). Core images were then analyzed using ImageScope
software (version 10.0.35.1800, Aperio Technology). Brieﬂy,
pathologists (S.J. Rodig and J.L. Kutok) identiﬁed areas of
tumors as regions of interest (ROI) and excluded areas without
signiﬁcant tumor using standard ImageScope software functions. The ROIs were then analyzed using a standard analysis
algorithm (color deconvolution v9.0, Aperio Technology) to
quantify the average optical density of Gal-1 staining and the
percentage of positive pixels in the annotated tumor area.
Real-time RT-PCR
Transcriptional proﬁle of galectins was analyzed in human
prostate cancer cell lines (log phase of growth) that are
representative of different stages of tumor progression. Transcriptional proﬁle of angiogenesis-related genes was analyzed
in plugs generated by injection of Gal-1–sufﬁcient or Gal-1–
silenced human 22Rv1 cells into nude mice. In all cases, RNA
was puriﬁed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) coupled to
DNAse (RQ1, Promega) treatment. Four hundred nanograms
of total RNA was used for the reverse transcription reaction by
using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, random hexamers
(2.5 mg/mL) and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP; 500
nmol/L) according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen)

30 minutes at 37 C. One microliter of a 1:25 dilution of cDNA
was used as template in real-time PCR. Relative gene expression was analyzed using SYBR Green PCR Kit (Applied Biosystem, Life Technologies). PCR conditions were as follows: 5
minutes 95 C, 40 cycles 30 seconds at 95 C, 32 seconds at 59 C,
and 45 seconds at 72 C. Ampliﬁcation fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose TAE (40mmol/L Tris,
40 mmol/L acetate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.2) gel and by thermal
dissociation curves (Tm) to characterize the amplicon corresponding to each primer couple. Primers used are listed in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Cyclophilin A was used as an
internal reference gene (27). Equivalent amounts of RNA were
tested to rule out genomic DNA contamination.
Immunoblotting
Speciﬁcity of anti-galectin antibodies was evaluated by
immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S2). Cells were lysed in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris–HCl pH 8, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L sodium
vanadate, and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (Calbiochem)].
Equal amounts of protein (10–30 mg) were resolved by 15% SDSPAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare), blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and probed with anti-galectin or anti-b-tubulin (H-235
1:200, Santa Cruz) antibodies or preimmune rabbit antiserum.
The following dilutions of antibodies were used: anti-Gal-1
(1:500), Gal-3 (1:400), Gal-4 (1:100), Gal-8 (1:400), Gal-9
(1:100), Gal-12 (1:100), and rabbit IgG anti-Gal-1 at 1:1,500).
Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-labeled antirabbit total immunoglobulins (1:3,000; Sigma) or by peroxidaselabeled rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:2,000; Sigma). Peroxidase activity
was detected using a luminol-based method and chemiluminescence was determined using a Fuji Photo Film Analyzer.
Lentivirus vector production and transduction
pLv-HTM plasmid (provided by Trono Didier, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland) is a self-inactivation third generation HIV-1–derived vector (28). Annealed oligonucleotides
coding for short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were ligated into ClaI
and MluI double-restricted plasmids by standard cloning.
Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England
BioLabs. Production of shRNA was under the control of H1
(human RNA polymerase type III promoter). As reporter gene,
GFP was expressed under the control of eukaryotic EF-1a
promoter. Plasmids were veriﬁed by sequence analysis. Lentiviral particles were produced by transient transfection of 293T
cells. Brieﬂy, subconﬂuent 293T cells were cotransfected with 20
mg plasmid vector, 15 mg pCMVR8.74, and 5 mg pMD.G [pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG)] using
calcium phosphate. Supernatants were harvested at 48 and 72
hours and stored at 80 C until use. Viral titers expressed as
TU/mL were determined by assessing transduction of 22Rv1
cells with serial dilutions of virion preparations. 22Rv1 prostate
cancer cells were transduced with virus at multiplicity of
infection (MOI) ¼ 5 in the presence of 5 mg/mL protamine
sulfate (Sigma). After 1 week, transduced cells (GFPþ) were
puriﬁed using a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Bioscience).

In vitro capillary-like tube formation and in vivo Matrigel
plug assay
Matrigel (150 mL; BD Biosciences) was added to 24-well
plates and allowed to polymerize for 2 hours at 37 C. Conditioned media were added to wells and 2.5  104 BAEC were
seeded on each well. Tube formation was evaluated in 5
different ﬁelds of each well and photographed at 18 hours
using an inverted microscope. For in vivo assays, cold Matrigel
was mixed with 5  106 22Rv1 cells in the absence or presence
of a Gal-1 blocking or isotype control mAb (7.5 mg/kg). The
mixture (500 mL) was subcutaneously injected into 6-week-old
male nude mice. Five days later, Matrigel plugs were harvested
and photographed. Matrigel plugs were homogenized in 500 mL
H2O on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 200  g for 6
minutes at 4 C. Hemoglobin content was determined using the
Drabkin's reagent (Wiener Lab).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SD of at least 3 independent
experiments in triplicate. Comparisons between 2 groups were
conducted by using paired Student t test or Spearman correlation test as indicated. Differences were considered signiﬁcant
when P values were less than 0.05.

Results
Identiﬁcation of "the galectin signature" of human
prostate cancer cells
To delineate the galectin expression proﬁle during prostate
cancer progression, we ﬁrst examined the galectin-transcriptional pattern of several human prostate cancer cell lines,
which are representative of different stages of the disease.
These include the hormone-responsive cell line LNCaP and the
castration-resistant cell lines 22Rv1 and PC-3, which are ARpositive (22Rv1) or negative (PC-3) respectively. Total RNA was
extracted in the log phase of growth and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Gal-1 was found to be the most
abundantly expressed galectin in all cells analyzed and its
expression was higher in prostate cancer cells exhibiting more
aggressive behavior in vivo (22Rv1 and PC-3; ref. 27). Transcripts for Gal-8, which has been postulated as prostate cancer
marker (21, 29), were expressed at moderate levels in all
prostate cancer cell lines tested. Gal-3 mRNA was only detected
in castration-resistant, AR-negative PC-3 cells. Transcripts for
all other galectin family members (Gal-2, -4, -7, -9, -10, -12, and
-13) were expressed at very low levels.
To further delineate the "galectin-speciﬁc prostate cancer
signature," we assessed the expression of galectin family
members at the protein level (focusing on galectins with higher
transcript abundance). Immunocytochemical analysis conﬁrmed that Gal-1 was the most abundantly expressed galectin
in the prostate cancer cell lines analyzed, showing upregulated
expression in the most aggressive cell lines (Fig. 1B). On the
other hand, Gal-3 was selectively expressed in the PC-3 cell line,
Gal-8 was detected in all the 3 cell lines and Gal-9 and -12
showed a modest expression in all cell lines analyzed. These
results indicate a ﬁne regulation of galectin expression in
prostate cancer cell lines characterized by differences in
phenotype, hormone-dependency, and aggressiveness.

Analysis of the galectin expression proﬁle of human
primary prostate tumors
The differential expression of galectins in prostate cancer
cell lines prompted us to investigate the galectin proﬁle in
prostatectomies obtained from 61 patients with newly diagnosed untreated disease. Samples included a large spectrum of
prostate cancer stages (T1, T2, T3, and T4 according to TNM
classiﬁcation; UICC, 2002) in addition to a benign stage
(BHP; Table 1). Similar to prostate cancer cell lines, Gal-1 was
highly expressed in primary tumors and its expression was
upregulated in more advanced lesions (Fig. 2). On the other
hand, although typically expressed at lower levels, Gal-3, -4, -9,
and -12 decreased gradually as the disease progressed toward
more aggressive stages. Conversely, Gal-8 was expressed at
moderate levels in lesions corresponding to all stages. These
data delineate a "galectin-speciﬁc signature" characterized by

Galectin-1 is a novel target for antiangiogenic therapies
in advanced human prostate cancer
Because Gal-1 expression is associated with prostate cancer
aggressiveness and has emerged as a novel proangiogenic
factor in other tumor types (30, 31), we asked whether this
lectin was differentially expressed in tumor areas associated to
blood vessels in human prostate cancer. To address this issue,
we investigated whether a correlation exists between Gal-1 and
CD34 expression using a human tissue array comprising 29
paired cores of invasive prostate cancer classiﬁed according to
proliferation rates and cell morphology (Table 2). A positive
correlation was found between Gal-1 and CD34 expression in
arrays representing advanced stages of human prostate cancer
(Fig. 3A). This correlation was not observed in arrays of human
breast cancer (Fig. 3A), suggesting tissue-speciﬁc proangiogenic effects of this lectin.
Given the promising value of antiangiogenic therapies in
castration-resistant advanced prostate cancer (32), we examined the role of Gal-1 in prostate cancer angiogenesis. We

evaluated the effect of conditioned medium obtained from a
Gal-1–positive prostate cancer cell line (22Rv1 conditioned
medium) on in vitro BAEC tubulogenesis. As shown in Fig. 4,
conditioned medium from 22Rv1 cells (Gal-1 concentration,
10.7 ng/mL) induced the formation of tubular structures
reﬂective of endothelial cell morphogenesis. To evaluate the
involvement of Gal-1, we exposed BAEC to conditioned medium from 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells in the presence of an antiGal-1 neutralizing mAb (25, 26). Neutralization of soluble Gal-1
considerably reduced tube formation (3.76  1.50 fold; n ¼ 10)
compared with BAEC exposed to prostate cancer conditioned
medium in the presence of a control isotype Ab (Fig. 4A and B).
The in vitro effects of Gal-1–expressing prostate cancer cells
on endothelial cell morphogenesis prompted us to investigate
the role of this endogenous lectin in angiogenesis in vivo using 2
different approaches to differentiate the source of Gal-1 (tumor
and microenvironment vs. tumor alone). First, we injected a
Matrigel mixture containing 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells and a

blocking anti-Gal-1 mAb (or its isotype control) into nude
mice. Second, we used 22Rv1 tumor cells that were transduced
with a human-speciﬁc Gal-1 shRNA-coding lentivirus (Gal-1shRNA-LV) puriﬁed to homogeneity by cell sorting. Nonsorted
bulk transduced 22Rv1 cells, with partial downregulation of
Gal-1, were also tested (Fig. 5A). A marked reduction of
microvessel density was observed using both experimental
approaches (anti-Gal-1 mAb and Gal-1 shRNA-LV), indicating
that tumor cells were the main source of Gal-1, at least at early
time points of tumor implantation (Fig. 5B and C). Intermediate effects were observed when Gal-1 was partially downregulated in prostate cancer cells (Fig. 5B and C). Altogether,
our results reveal a key role for Gal-1 as a mediator of prostate
cancer–induced angiogenesis.
As angiogenesis relies on the expression of hypoxia-regulated genes and Gal-1 is regulated by hypoxia in different tumor
types (26, 33, 34), we then examined the effects of hypoxia on
the galectin expression proﬁle of human prostate cancer. For

prostate cancer angiogenesis is independent of the upregulation or downregulation of classic proangiogenic or antiangiogenic factors and places Gal-1 as a critical mediator of tumor
angiogenesis.

Discussion
Prostate cancer is no longer viewed as a disease of abnormally proliferating epithelial cells, but rather as a disease
involving complex interactions between prostate cancer
epithelial cells and the tumor microenvironment. Multiple
signaling pathways and biologic events mediate tumor
growth, including AR signaling, tyrosine kinase receptor
signaling, angiogenesis, and tumor-immune escape (35).
Interactions between multivalent lectins and glycans participate in this complex network by modulating stromal,
endothelial, and immune cell compartments (6, 7). Although
original assumptions based on conserved carbohydrate
speciﬁcity and structural homology suggested that galectins
may have redundant functions, recent information challenged this view showing speciﬁc roles for each member of
the galectin family in the regulation of tumor cell invasiveness, inﬂammation, and angiogenesis (7). In search for novel
biomarkers and therapeutic targets, here we identiﬁed a
"galectin-speciﬁc signature" associated with prostate cancer
progression. Galectin expression was proﬁled in prostate
cancer cell lines with diverse androgen-dependence properties and AR expression and in human primary tumors
obtained from treatment-free patients at different stages of
the disease.
Originally described as PCTA-1, Gal-8 has been reported to
be ubiquitously expressed in several tissues, but is upregulated
in prostate cancer (29). Our results conﬁrm that this "tandemrepeat" galectin is expressed by prostate cancer cell lines and
primary tumors, but indicate that the degree of Gal-8 expression is comparable in all tumor stages. Given the complexity of
Gal-8 isoforms, the variability of its intracellular localization
and its ubiquitous expression pattern, this galectin is likely to
be an important component of prostate cancer biology (29),
including modulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, and
angiogenesis (22, 36).
Interestingly, our results reveal that Gal-3, -4, -9, and -12 are
downmodulated in advanced stage primary tumors. These
data are consistent with earlier reports showing that Gal-3
expression decreases during tumor growth (10, 18) through
mechanisms including promoter methylation (19) and metalloproteinase-mediated protein cleavage (20). Depending on its
selective intracellular or extracellular localization, different
biologic properties have been assigned to Gal-3, resulting in
a dual pro- or antitumorigenic effect (10, 37). Our results
suggest that downregulation of Gal-3, combined with the
expression of other galectin members, is a hallmark of prostate
cancer progression. More importantly, our ﬁndings show that
Gal-1 is the most abundantly expressed galectin in prostate
cancer and its expression correlates with disease severity,
underscoring the relevance of this endogenous lectin as a
possible biomarker and therapeutic target in high-grade castration-refractory prostate cancer.

Previous studies aimed at delineating the galectin transcriptional proﬁle of a panel of human tumor cell lines revealed that
all prostate cancer cell lines analyzed (DU145, PC-3, and
LNCaP) were negative for Gal-2, -4, -7, and -9 but expressed
considerable amounts of Gal-8 (38). Moreover, Gal-1 and -3
were expressed in DU.145 and PC-3 but not in the LNCaP cell
line (38). In contrast to these ﬁndings, we detected signiﬁcant
expression of Gal-1 in LNCaP cells both at the mRNA and
protein levels, although at 20-fold lower levels than the androgen unresponsive 22Rv1 and PC-3 tumor cells. Moreover, Gal-1
expression augmented when LNCaP cells were cultured for
several weeks in the absence of hormones (LNCaP-CR; Supplementary Fig. S1A). As castration-sensitive or resistant
LNCaP cells were both PSA-positive and responsive to an AR
agonist (R1881; Supplementary Fig. S2B), the discrepancies in
Gal-1 expression among different studies might reﬂect different culture conditions, cell line sources, or selection protocols.
In this regard, our studies were conducted on prostate cancer
cells isolated during the log phase of growth and the results
were substantiated using primary tumors isolated at different
stages of the disease.
Given the pleiotropic functions of Gal-1 in the tumor microenvironment, including its role in angiogenesis (26, 31, 39, 40),
cell adhesion and invasiveness (16, 30), and immunosuppression (23–25, 41), upregulation of Gal-1 may dramatically
inﬂuence prostate cancer progression. In this regard, Gal-1
is expressed in endothelial cells (42–44) and is upregulated in
various cancer types (6). Here, we show that Gal-1 is the most
highly expressed and regulated galectin in the prostate
cancer microenvironment and plays essential roles in prostate cancer angiogenesis. The role of Gal-1 in angiogenesis
seems to be tissue-speciﬁc as Gal-1 expression correlates
with endothelial cell markers in advanced prostate cancer
but not in human breast cancer. These ﬁndings are consistent with the ability of Gal-1 to induce angiogenesis in
oligodendroglioma (30), B16 melanoma (31), and Kaposi's
sarcoma (26) but not in other tumor types such as Lewis lung
carcinoma (41).
Selective silencing strategies in tumors clearly showed that
the main cellular source of Gal-1 is represented by tumor cells.
However, mechanisms by which endothelial cells capture Gal-1
from the tumor microenvironment or tumor-induced endothelial cell activation upregulates Gal-1 expression have also
been described (31, 39). Moreover, as Gal-3 and -8 also contribute to angiogenesis in other tumor types, the spatiotemporal regulation of distinct members of the galectin family
might ultimately dictate the vascularization phenotype
(36, 45, 46, 47). Finally, Gal-1 silencing in prostate cancer cells
did not alter the expression of classic proangiogenic or antiangiogenic mediators neither in tumor cells nor in the tumor
microenvironment, highlighting a direct and critical role of this
lectin in prostate cancer angiogenesis.
In summary, our ﬁndings identify a distinctive "galectin
signature," which delineates tumor progression in human
prostate cancer and highlight a major role of Gal-1 as a novel
target of antiangiogenic therapies in advanced castrationresistant stages of prostate cancer, where effective treatments
are still lacking.
