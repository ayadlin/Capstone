Abstract
Ubc13 is an ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme that participates with many
different E3 ligases to form lysine 63-linked (Lys63) ubiquitin chains that are critical
to signaling in inflammatory and DNA damage response pathways. Recent studies have
suggested Ubc13 as a potential therapeutic target for intervention in various human
diseases including several different cancers, alleviation of anti-cancer drug resistance,
chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Understanding a potential therapeutic
target from different angles is important to assess its usefulness and potential pitfalls.
Here we present a global review of Ubc13 from its structure, function, and cellular
activities, to its natural and chemical inhibition. The aim of this article is to review
the literature that directly implicates Ubc13 in a biological function, and to integrate
structural and mechanistic insights into the larger role of this critical E2 enzyme. We
discuss observations of multiple Ubc13 structures that suggest a novel mechanism
for activation of Ubc13 that involves conformational change of the active site loop.

Introduction

covalent intermediate, which activates the ubiquitin
C-terminal carboxylate for subsequent transfer to the E1.
The sulfhydryl of the E1 active site cysteine attacks the
ubiquitin adenylate, forming a covalent thioester linkage
to the ubiquitin molecule (E1~Ub). The next enzyme in
the pathway, the E2 or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme,
binds the E1 and the ubiquitin is transferred to the E2
active site cysteine in a trans-thioesterification reaction to
form an E2~Ub conjugate. The last step in the cascade
is achieved using an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3). The E3 is
responsible for providing target specificity by bringing
the E2~Ub into close proximity with the target protein
so that the ubiquitin can finally be transferred to a target
lysine residue through the formation of an isopeptide
linkage between the ε-amino group of the lysine and
the C-terminal ubiquitin carboxylate. In the case of
HECT E3s, the ubiquitin is transferred from the active
site cysteine of the E2 enzyme to an active site cysteine
residue in the HECT E3, which is subsequently transferred
to a target lysine residue [7-9]. Polyubiquitin chains are
formed by repeating the E1-E2 step with stimulation by a
really interesting new gene (RING) E3 or E1-E2-E3 steps
with a HECT E3, where the donor ubiquitin C-terminus is
linked to an acceptor ubiquitin lysine instead of the lysine
residue of the substrate (target) protein [3-6]. General E2

Ubiquitination is a prime example of how evolution
has exploited the use of small proteins as signaling
molecules. The larger size of a protein compared with
signaling modifications such as phosphorylation,
methylation or acetylation provides more complexity and
consequentially a wider range of utility than the former
small modifications. Of course there are benefits to small
and large post-translational modifications (PTMs), hence
the existence of both. Ubiquitin is a ~8 kDa protein that
can be conjugated to other proteins by its C-terminal
carboxylate through the formation of an isopeptide
bond resulting in a monoubiquitinated substrate [1, 2].
It can also be used to form homogenous, mixed, linear
or branched polyubiquitin chains through successive
isopeptide bond formation using one of its seven lysine
residues (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48,
Lys63) or its N-terminal methionine (Met1) [1, 2].
There is a generally accepted E1-E2-E3 enzymatic
cascade that is used to create most ubiquitin chains, with
linkage specificity based on the particular E2 conjugating
enzyme (E2) or homology to E6AP C terminus (HECT) E3
used [3-7]. The cascade commences with an E1 activating
enzyme (E1) that catalyzes formation of an AMP-ubiquitin

first prime substrate lysine residues in cellular studies
that implicate Ubc13 in modifying proteins with Lys63linked polyubiquitin chains. The possibility exists that if
the heterodimer of Ubc13 with Mms2/Uev1A is disrupted
that Ubc13 could be used to directly monoubiquitinate
substrates, however in this unlikely case the Lys63-linked
polyubiquitination ability would also be abolished.
Ubc13 is likely the only E2 enzyme that requires
the presence of a non-catalytic E2-variant, such as
Mms2/Uev1A to specifically build ubiquitin chains. As
described above, Mms2/Uev1A are the Lys63 linkage
specificity determinant for Ubc13 catalytic activity
(in the absence of a HECT E3). One study, however,
suggested that Ubc13 could function with the RING E3
ligase RNF8, independent of the E2-variants [34]. This
study used Mms2 deficient MEF cells, however the
possibility of contributions from Uev1A were not ruled
out. Additionally, the study performed siRNA knockdown
of Mms2/Uev1A in HeLa cells where the western blot
showed residual low expression of Mms2/Uev1A. Due to
the possibility of residual Mms2 expression, our current
more complete understanding of the mechanistic details
of the RNF8/Ubc13/Mms2 complex, and the lack of other
supporting studies, it is unlikely that Ubc13 functions
without the E2-variants Mms2/Uev1A.
In general, one of many possible E3 ligases can bind
the E2~Ub complex to recruit the charged E2 to the protein
target. The E3 is not only a recruitment factor but plays an
important role in stimulating the catalytic activity of the
E2. The E3s TRAF6 [35, 36], Chfr [37], RNF8, RNF168
[33, 38], and the U-box E3 CHIP (carboxy terminus of
Hsp70-interacting protein) [32, 39, 40] have all been
shown to interact with Ubc13 and activate Ubc13 catalytic
potential. The RING E3 stimulation ability is largely
attributed to E2~Ub conformational selection from a more
randomly distributed covalently linked ubiquitin [41], to a
relatively confined, catalytically “active” position (Figure
1B, 1C) [39, 42-45]. Indeed, we recently demonstrated
RING E3-mediated ubiquitin conformational selection
through comparison of wild type and mutant RNF8
(Leu451Asp) in complex with Ubc13~Ub and Ubc13~Ub/
Mms2 in solution using small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) [45]. The ubiquitin conformational selection
is achieved through non-covalent interactions of the
E2-linked ubiquitin molecule with E3 RING and E2
surfaces, which likely orients the E2-ubiquitin thioester
linkage in the E2 active site to favor catalytic attack by
the nucleophilic lysine residue. Additionally, we used the
RNF8 Leu451Asp mutation to show that both the E2stimulation and E2 recruitment of RING E3 ligases are
critical for the cellular role of E3s.

Mechanism
of
Lys63-linked
ubiquitin chain synthesis
The chemical formation of a Lys63-linked ubiquitin
chain is achieved by the E2 Ubc13 together with either
of two non-catalytic, E2-like partner proteins, Mms2,
which participates in nuclear Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain
formation, or Uev1A, which is nearly identical to Mms2
and is involved in cytoplasmic ubiquitination [12, 13].
Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains can also be formed by the
HECT E3 ligases yeast Rsp5 [14, 15] and human Nedd41 [16] and Itch/AIP4 [17], regardless of the E2 enzyme
used [18]. A number of studies have revealed in structural
detail how Ubc13 participates with Mms2 or Uev1A to
build Lys63-linked polyubiquitin (Figure 1A) [19-23].
The previously mentioned E1-E2 trans-thioesterification
reaction results in a donor ubiquitin covalently linked
to the active site cysteine (Cys87) of Ubc13. A second
acceptor ubiquitin molecule binds to Mms2/Uev1A noncovalently, which positions the ubiquitin Lys63 for attack
on the Ubc13C87-donor ubiquitin thioester linkage [19,
24-26]. The acceptor ubiquitin Lys63 is directly engaged
by Ubc13 Asn123, which may drive a conformational
change in the Ubc13 active site loop to accommodate the
incoming Lys63 (Figure 1A) [27]. The Mms2-ubiquitin
non-covalent interaction is largely mediated by the
canonical hydrophobic patch on ubiquitin (Leu8, Ile44,
Val70) and a surface on Mms2 composed of residues
Met54, Ile56, and Ile67 [19, 28, 29]. Suppression of the
pKa and deprotonation of the ubiquitin Lys63 promotes
nucleophilic attack on the thioester resulting in the
formation of an isopeptide bond [30]. This reaction
likely forms an oxyanion thioester intermediate, and the
developing negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen is
thought to be stabilized by the conserved Ubc13 Asn79
[31].
Given the mechanism described above, it is
unlikely that the Ubc13/E2-variant heterodimer directly
monoubiquitinates substrate lysine residues. It is more
likely that Ubc13 extends existing chains or builds them
on previously monoubiquitinated substrates. Indeed,
Soss et al. [32] showed that in contrast to other E2
enzymes, Ubc13/Uev1A alone could not modify the E3
ligase CHIP in vitro, but created free ubiquitin chains.
If, however, the E2 enzymes Ube2E1 or Ube2W that
monoubiquitinate CHIP and Hsp70, were included in the
reactions to prime the substrates with monoubiquitin, the
substrates were polyubiquitinated. The apparent inability
of Ubc13/E2-variant to directly ubiquitinate substrates
is further highlighted by Mattiroli et al. [33], which
demonstrated that Ubc13/Mms2/RNF8 efficiently extends
monoubiquitinated substrate histone H2A in vitro, but not
unmodified H2A. It is likely then, that other E2 enzymes

are considered modest relative to other enzymes. To put
Ubc13/Mms2 into perspective within the family of E2
enzymes a comparison of Ubc13/Mms2 to one of the
fastest known E2s, the small ubiquitin-related modifier
(SUMO) E2 enzyme Ubc9, showed that Ubc13/Mms2 has
an approximate 14-fold slower kcat [30, 55].
Several studies have examined residues important
for the structural integrity and catalytic proficiency of
Ubc13 (Figure 3). Berndsen et al. [56] made a series of
mutations to Ubc13 Asn79, with varying effects on the
catalytic efficiency of Ubc13. The mutations Asn79 to Ala
or Asp decreased diubiquitin formation in the presence
of Rad5 RING and caused a severe defect in diubiquitin
formation in the absence of Rad5 RING (Figure 3).
Three other Asn79 mutations, Asn79 to His, Ser, or
Gln, decreased diubiquitin formation in the absence of
Rad5 RING, but had normal diubiquitin formation in
the presence of Rad5 RING. Collectively, the study
by Berndsen et al. [56] demonstrated a structural role
of Asn79 in Ubc13 catalytic function, in addition to its
probable role in stabilization of the negative charge in
the oxyanion thioester intermediate during nucleophilic
attack by the incoming acceptor ubiquitin Lys63 [31].
We found that the Ubc13 mutations Ser96Asp and
Ala98Asp of the conserved Ser-Pro-Ala motif resulted in
loss of complex formation with the RNF8 RING dimer
(Figure 3) [38]. In a separate study, we made a series of
mutations to the Ubc13 active site loop to investigate the
importance of dynamics to the catalytic function of the
enzyme [57]. Ubc13 Asp118Gly or Ala122Gly caused
different active site loop conformations than wild type,
increased the loop flexibility on the pico- to nanosecond
time scale, increased the rate of thioester hydrolysis, and
impaired aminolysis. Ubc13 Leu121Gly had a similar
active site loop conformation to wild type, a similar
rate of thioester hydrolysis, and impaired aminolysis
(Figure 3). Additionally, we mutated Ubc13 Leu121 to
Ala, Val, or Ile, which resulted in an approximate linear
increase in aminolysis rate with increasing availability
of hydrophobic surface area that implicated Leu121 in
desolvation of the active site [57]. In a study of Ubc13
inhibitors further discussed in a later section, we made
a quadruple mutant of Ubc13 (Asp81Asn, Arg85Ser,
Ala122Val, Asn123Pro), which flipped the Ubc13 active
site loop to mimic the conformation present in UbcH5c,
and this caused resistance to the small-molecule inhibitor

that can cleave a ubiquitin-substrate isopeptide bond
with specificity for Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains [46,
47]. It was found to negatively regulate chromatin
ubiquitination at DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites
by binding to Ubc13 and inhibiting its E2-conjugating
activity [47]. OTUB1 knockdown caused persistence
in both conjugated-ubiquitin (FK2) foci and 53BP1
foci [47]. The lowered OTUB1 levels also restored
homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSB repair
in ATM-inhibited cells, monitored through a direct-repeat
green fluorescent reporter (DR-GFP) assay that measures
repair of an endonuclease site-specific DSB via HR
[48, 49]. OTUB1 can also bind E2s of the UBE2E and
UBE2D families [46, 47, 50]. Structures of OTUB1 with
UbcH5b~Ub and Ubc13~Ub and free ubiquitin molecules
and Ubc13/Mms2/OTUB1 have been determined [46, 5153]. This work revealed that OTUB1 directly binds E2~Ub
together with a second non-covalently bound ubiquitin
and shed light on how OTUB1 inhibits a subset of E2s
independent of its isopeptidase activity. Figure 2A shows
the binding of a hybrid human (residues 1-45)/worm
(OTU domain) OTUB1 to Ubc13~Ub. The hybrid was
made because the important N-terminus of worm OTUB1
has poor conservation compared to human [52]. This
N-terminal OTUB1 extension was shown to be necessary
for E2 inhibition and interferes with the Mms2/Uev1A
binding site on Ubc13 (Figure 2B) [52, 53].
The OTUB1 N-terminal extension also binds to the
E2-linked donor ubiquitin in a similar manner to a UIM
domain. The N-terminal extension shields the E2-ubiquitin
linkage and prevents the donor ubiquitin interaction with
the E2, which is important for its conjugation activity [46].
Interestingly, the free ubiquitin that binds to a distal site
of OTUB1 in the structures was shown to greatly enhance
OTUB1 binding affinity selectively towards conjugated
Ubc13~Ub over free Ubc13 [46, 52]. The positions of
the E2-linked donor and free ubiquitin in the OTUB1
structures resembles a Lys48-linked diubiquitin poised
for isopeptidase deubiquitination where the hypothetical
Lys48 linkage would be very close to the OTUB1 catalytic
cysteine residue. Another obvious inhibitory feature
of OTUB1 binding to Ubc13~Ub (or E2~Ub) is that it
occludes/overlaps with the RING E3 binding site (Figure
2B).

PTMs that affect Ubc13 and
Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain

When considering the catalytic function of
Ubc13, it is important to acknowledge that it requires
interaction with either Mms2 in the nucleus, or Uev1A
in the cytoplasm to form Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains.
Ubc13 and Mms2 form a tight complex (KD = 49 ± 7
nM [54]) and mutations that disrupt this complex have
detrimental effects on Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain
synthesis. In general, the catalytic rates of E2 enzymes

their effect directly or indirectly on Ubc13. A recent study
has examined Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin, which
is produced by the protein kinase, PINK1 [58]. Ser65phosphorylated ubiquitin activates the RBR E3 ligase
Parkin and is involved in the onset of Parkinson’s disease.
Wauer et al. [58] tested a subset of E2 enzymes, in vitro,
for ubiquitin charging (E2~Ub formation by E1) and
polyubiquitin chain building. They found that all enzymes,
including Ubc13, could be charged with ubiquitin, but that
Ubc13/Uev1A-mediated Lys63-ubiquitin chain formation
was inhibited by phospho-Ub. The authors hypothesize
that the phosphate group on ubiquitin Ser65 would
sterically preclude ubiquitin binding to Uev1A/Mms2. It
remains to be determined whether phospho-Ub is used as
an inhibitor of Ubc13 in a biological context, however the
notion is intriguing and would add another layer of control
to this critical, non-redundant enzyme.
Valimberti et al. [59] demonstrated that a conserved
E2 Ser/Asp site exists in E2s that plays a role in correctly

orienting the incoming substrate lysine toward the
active site cysteine for catalysis. Some E2s are directly
phosphorylated at the serine residue near the E2 active
site loop, which increases the E2 catalytic activity [59].
Alternatively, other E2 enzymes conserve a negative
charge at the same site near the active site loop and Ubc13
is one such E2 (Ubc13 residue Asp119).
Ubc13 can be targeted by another PTM termed
ISGylation, where a ubiquitin-like protein, interferonstimulated gene 15 kDa (ISG15) [60], is attached to a
target lysine residue through its C-terminal glycine, much
like ubiquitin [61, 62]. Cellular proteins are ISGylated
upon interferon stimulation as part of an antiviral response
[60]. The target site on Ubc13 is lysine 92, which is close
to the active site cysteine. ISGylation of Lys92 was found
to inhibit the ability of the E2 to be charged with ubiquitin
by an E1 enzyme (Ubc13~Ub), but not the capacity to bind
Mms2 [61, 62]. Minakawa et al. performed experiments
where the components of the ISGylation system (UBE1L

(E1), UbcH8 (E2) and ISG15), together with TRAF6 (to
activate the NF-κB pathway) were transiently transfected
into mammalian cell lines and NF-κB pathway activation
was monitored using a luciferase reporter [60]. The NFκB pathway was suppressed by the expression of the
ISGylation system. In addition to the C-terminal glycine
ISG15 modification, substrates can also be modified by
the highly conserved and reactive ISG15 Cys78 residue,
which is reducing agent-sensitive [63]. ISG15 Cys78 can
form a disulfide bridge with the Ubc13 active site cysteine
(Cys87), which would undoubtedly have an inhibitory
effect on its catalytic function. Again, it is not yet known
whether modification of Ubc13 Cys87 is physiologically
relevant, nor whether the ISG15 disulfide modifications

are relevant in general, so future studies must be done to
interrogate these observations.

Figure 4: Ubc13 in DNA damage response and tolerance pathways. A. Role of Ubc13 in DNA DSB signaling. DNA DSBs are
initially recognized by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, leading to phosphorylation of chromatin associated proteins including H2AX
(γH2AX), Nbs1 and MDC1. Ubc13/Mms2 participates with RNF8 to create Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains that recruit downstream repair
factors for HR repair when the cell is in S/G2 phase. Histones H2AX, H2A, and H4 are labeled by letters X, A, and 4 in the nucleosomes,
respectively. B. Role of Ubc13 in DNA replication stress. DNA template damage causes pausing of DNA polymerase, dissociation of the
polymerase from the helicase, and accumulation of RPA on the resulting ssDNA (top and middle). The damage can be circumvented by the
recruitment of a specialized polymerase that can read through the damaged template DNA (middle panel) or through a template switching
mechanism that involves Ubc13 (bottom panel). Ubc13/Mms2 works with the E3 ligases SHPRH and HLTF to form Lys63-linked ubiquitin
chains on previously monoubiquitinated PCNA to initiate TS repair at stalled DNA replication forks. The E3 ligases that participate with
Ubc13 are colored orange.

cytoplasm and nucleus was reported to have a Ubc13dependent late-stage role in HR repair, which also requires
further investigation [91].
The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway deals
with UV-induced DNA damage (for a review see [92]).
One of the first major steps in global genome NER is the
recognition of DNA-distorting UV lesions by a primary
sensor, XPC, with the help of centrin 2 (CETN2) and UV
excision repair protein RAD23 homologue B (RAD23B)
[92]. In response to UV damage, XPC is poly-SUMO2/3
sumoylated, which provides a binding platform for the
SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) of RING finger protein
111 (RNF111) [93]. Poulsen et al. show that RNF111
binds Ubc13/Mms2 and promotes Lys63 ubiquitination
of sumoylated XPC, which regulates its accumulation
on damaged DNA [93]. A further role for Ubc13 in UVinduced DNA repair comes from work which implicates
Ubc13 and RNF8 in UV-induced ubiquitination [94].
Both proteins were found to localize to UV-induced DNA
damage in HeLa cells, and Ubc13- and RNF8-knockdown
resulted in increased sensitivity to UV, however not to the
same extent as cells in which the NER endonucleases,
XPG and XPF were knocked down. The siRNA-mediated
knockdown of Ubc13 and RNF8 did not affect the DNA
synthesis gap-filling stage of NER, suggesting that Ubc13/
RNF8 plays a role peripheral to the predominant NER
process [94]. 53BP1 is phosphorylated and accumulates at
sites of DNA damage after UV irradiation [95], which was
found to be partly dependent on RNF8 and Ubc13 through
siRNA knockdown experiments [94, 95].

cell makes use of a newly replicated sister chromatid as
an accurate template for repair of the damaged DNA.
HR is initiated when the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN)
complex binds the broken DNA ends to process them
and recruits ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase
to phosphorylate the histone variant H2AX, termed
ɣ-H2AX (Figure 4) [64-68]. ATM also phosphorylates
a host of other DNA damage response (DDR) factors
including CHK2 and p53, involved in cell cycle arrest,
senescence, or apoptosis [69]. This provides a binding
platform for the adaptor protein MDC1, which binds
ɣH2AX through its BRCT domain [70-72]. MDC1 then
undergoes two important phosphorylations [71]. The first
is by casein kinase 2 (CK2), a kinase that constitutively
phosphorylates Ser-Asp-Thr motifs on MDC1 that mediate
binding interactions with Nbs1 (MRN nuclease complex
component) [70]. The second is by the ATM kinase,
which is bound by the FHA domain of the E3 ligase
RNF8 (Figure 4) [70, 73, 74]. RNF8 binds the Ubc13/
Mms2 E2 heterodimer with its RING domain to stimulate
the formation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains [19, 38,
74-76]. Some studies suggest that a E3 ligase, HERC2,
is sumoylated upon DSB induction and facilitates Ubc13
binding to RNF8 [77, 78]. It is likely that Ubc13/RNF8
then ubiquitinates previously monoubiquitinated H1-type
linker histones, which recruits RNF168 through its motifs
interacting with ubiquitin (MIUs) to amplify the Lys63linked ubiquitin chains [79]. Once recruited, RNF168 can
then function with the E2 UbcH5c to monoubiquitinate
histones H2A/H2AX on Lys13-15 (Figure 4) [33, 67,
80]. The Lys15 ubiquitinated H2A (H2ALys15ub)
then serves as a target for 53BP1 binding, which may
actually promote NHEJ in opposition to BRCA1 [81].
The extended Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains generated
from the cooperative activity of RNF8/RNF168 recruit
RAP80 through its ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs),
which results in the binding of ABRA1 and BRCA1, to
ultimately promote HR (Figure 4) [69, 82-85]. Multiple
nucleases resect the broken DNA ends to form 3’ singlestranded overhangs, which are coated by the proteins RPA,
RAD54, and RAD51 [86, 87]. With the help of RAD52,
this nucleoprotein filament invades the homologous sister
chromatid forming a D-loop, the 3’ overhang is extended
by a polymerase, and the resulting Holliday junction is
eventually resolved [88]. It should be noted that MDC1
was found to be Lys63-ubiquitinated in a Ubc13dependent manner in the absence of DNA damage, and
that this action facilitates RAP80 binding to MDC1 [89].
The possibility that these ubiquitination events play some
role in the DNA damage response has not, however, been
ruled out.
One understudied role of Ubc13 is in chromatin
remodeling via acetylation and ubiquitination-dependent
release of H2AX from IR-damaged DNA, which involves
TIP60 and Ubc13 [90]. Additionally, a phosphoprotein
nucleophosmin (NPM1) that moves between the

DNA damage tolerance pathways and the role of
Ubc13
When DNA replication machinery encounters DNA
damage on the template strand, DNA damage tolerance
(DDT) pathways are initiated to allow eukaryotic
cells to continue replication past the damage [96, 97].
Two predominant DDT pathways are the error-prone
translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and error-free lesion
bypass or template switching (TS) pathways (Figure 4)
[96-98]. During DNA replication, proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) forms a ring around double-stranded
DNA, which acts as a sliding clamp for DNA polymerases
[97], while a helicase unwinds the DNA duplex. Upon
DNA damage the E2 conjugating enzyme Rad6 and the E3
ligase Rad18 are recruited by replication protein A (RPA)coated single strand DNA (ssDNA) [99, 100] to work
together to monoubiquitinate PCNA on Lys164, which
facilitates recruitment and interaction of PCNA with TLS
polymerases (Figure 4) [101-103]. The ATR checkpoint is
also engaged, which requires ATRIP and the 911 complex
[100]. Elongation of monoubiquitinated PCNA with
Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains by Ubc13/Mms2 with the
E3 ligase Rad5 (yeast) transitions the DDT pathway to

as an accurate template through DNA replication fork
regression [96, 97]. The Ubc13-dependent Lys63-linked
ubiquitin chains may be pre-formed and transferred as a
unit to intermediate E2s and then to PCNA as opposed
to extension of monoubiquitinated PCNA [108]. SHPRH
and human helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF)
are both human orthologs of yeast Rad5 with E3 ligase
activities, which play a similar role to Rad5 in human cells
(Figure 4) [109-112]. Alternatively, one study suggests
that RNF8 may be able to act as the E3 ligase for Ubc13/
Mms2 in Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA in the
TS pathway [113]. TS may also involve a protein called
TREX2, which appears to bind Ubc13 and to be important
for PCNA ubiquitination [114]. Other studies have shown

that yeast PCNA can be modified at Lys127/Lys164 with
SUMO by Ubc9 [101], which may suppress undesirable
HR [115-117], and may involve additional TLS and TS
machinery [118].

Role of Ubc13 in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway
The FA pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks
(ICLs), which if left unrepaired, inhibit DNA transcription
and replication, leading to stalled replication forks [119].
Upon DNA damage, two main protein complexes localize
to the damaged DNA, which then signal downstream
repair proteins. The first is a large complex of ~8 proteins
called the FA core complex which monoubiquitinates

Figure 5: Ubc13 in immune and inflammation signaling. In the canonical NF-κB pathway, receptor activation (left of dashed line),
the TNFα stimulates TNFR in a Ubc13 dependent manner that either leads to NF-κB activation or apoptosis. IL-1β stimulation of IL-1R and
stimulation of TLRs lead to NF-κB activation in a Ubc13-dependent way. In the noncanonical NF-κB pathway receptor activation (right
of dashed line) CD40L stimulation of CD40 involves Ubc13-dependent Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains and leads to p52/RelB (NF-κB)
activation. TGFβ stimulation of TβRI/II activates JNK, p38 and TAK1 through Ubc13-dependent activity. The E3 ligases that participate
with Ubc13 are colored orange.

the next complex in the pathway, the FANCI/FANCD2
complex. This complex further associates with FA
protein complexes that include proteins such as BRCA2,
BRIP1, and PALB2 [119]. The FA core protein complex
FA-associated protein 20 kDa (FAAP20) was found to
be necessary for normal DNA damage induced FANCI/
FANCD2 monoubiquitination and FANCD2 recruitment
to ICLs [120]. siRNA experiments demonstrated that
recruitment of FAAP20 to DNA damage sites requires
RNF8/Ubc13-dependent Lys63-linked polyubiquitination,
and that FAAP20 can bind Lys63-ubiquitin chains in vitro
with a ubiquitin binding domain (UBD) [120]. Further,
mutation of the FAAP20 UBD abolished its accumulation
at DNA damage induced ICLs.

126] is a signal transduction network that is initiated by
stimulation of a cell surface receptor and transduction of
the signal through the cytoplasm, leading to activation
and translocation of the NF-κB transcription factor into
the nucleus [123, 127]. NF-κB signaling is grouped into
canonical and non-canonical pathways, which all involve
stimulation of a cell surface receptor by cytokines or
pathogen-derived molecules. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and interleukin1β (IL-1β) stimulate the canonical NF-κB pathway, and
BAFF, CD40L, and lymphotoxin-β heterotrimers (LTs)
stimulate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway (Figure 5)
[123, 126]. Cell surface receptor stimulation by TNFα
and IL-1β in the canonical NF-κB pathway use different
mechanisms to drive the same result: stimulation of
phosphorylation of inhibitor of κB (IκB) by IκB kinase
(IKK) and subsequent Lys48 ubiquitination-mediated
degradation of IκB. The release of NF-κB from IκB allows
NF-κB translocation to the nucleus [123, 126].

Ubc13 function at telomeres
Telomeres are the repetitive DNA sequences that
together with the telomere-binding protein complex
shelterin, protect the ends of chromosomes from premature
shortening and inappropriate DDR protein recognition as
DSBs [121]. The Tpp1 component of shelterin is required
to bind and protect the DNA ends from the detrimental
initiation of classical and alternative nonhomologous
end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathways. Unscheduled
NHEJ at telomeres can result in harmful chromosomal
fusions, deletions, and translocations [121]. In vitro
ubiquitination reactions demonstrated that the RNF8/
Ubc13/Mms2 complex likely extends monoubiquitinated
Tpp1 (Tpp1 was purified from 293T and E1 and RNF8
from Sf9 cells), with Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains
[122]. In cells, RNF8 was shown to interact with Tpp1
through immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that
Ubc13 and RNF8 participate to Lys63-ubiquitinate premonoubiquitinated Tpp1. Additionally, siRNA knockdown
of Ubc13 caused loss of Tpp1, likely through degradation
[122]. Collectively, this study suggests that RNF8/Ubc13
Lys63-ubiquitinate and stabilize (pre-monoubiquitinated)
Tpp1 to protect telomeres. As previously mentioned
RNF8/Ubc13 participates in the recruitment of 53BP1
to sites of DNA DSBs, although this can be achieved in
the absence of RNF8. 53BP1 represses DSB resection
necessary for HR-repair at telomeres [121], so it is
possible that RNF8/Ubc13 promotes 53BP1 recruitment to
prevent telomere resection in addition to stabilizing Tpp1.

Activation of canonical NF-κB pathway receptors
IL-1β stimulation of the canonical NF-κB pathway
through binding to a Toll-like receptor (TLR) or IL-1
receptor (IL-1R) causes recruitment of the myeloid
differentiation primary gene (MyD88) followed by IL1β-associated kinases 1 (IRAK1) and 4 (IRAK4) to the
intracellular receptor site (Figure 5) [126]. Pellino E3
ligases may participate with Ubc13 to polyubiquitinate
(pre-monoubiquitinated) IRAK1 with Lys63-linked
ubiquitin chains, to possibly contribute to IKK activation
[128, 129]. TRAF6 is also recruited to the intracellular
receptor and functions with Ubc13/Uev1A to form
free Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains as well as TRAF6conjugated chains [36, 124, 130-132]. TAK1 kinase is
targeted to the Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains by TAB2/3,
which allows TAK1 to phosphorylate and activate IKK
(targeted to Lys63/Met1 hybrid chains by NEMO) (Figure
5) [124-126, 133, 134]. It should be noted that the type
of ubiquitin chains (Lys63 [135-138] versus linear
Met1 [139-143]) used to activate IKK was previously
controversial, however the Emmerich et al. study [134]
has provided clarity to the issue by demonstrating that
the majority of linear Met1 ubiquitin chains are actually
Lys63/Met1 hybrid chains, so it is likely that both
chain types are necessary for proper IKK activation. A
study by Yamazaki et al. [144] showed the existence of
an alternative branched pathway of the IL-1β-induced
NF-κB pathway, which diverges at the TRAF6 step.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase
(MEKK) binds to TRAF6 and may be ubiquitinated by
TRAF6/Ubc13 although MEKK can be activated with a
ligase-deficient RING mutant of TRAF6, which activates
IKK [144]. It should be noted that the NF-κB pathway
dependence on Ubc13 is cell type specific and a summary
of Ubc13 knockout phenotypes can be found in the review

Role of Ubc13 in inflammation
and immune response pathways
NF-κB pathway
Ubc13 is heavily involved in inflammation and
immune response pathways, largely through its role in
NF-κB signaling (Figure 5). The NF-κB pathway [123www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by Wu and Karin [123].
In the TNFα-stimulated pathway, TNFα binding to
a TNF receptor (TNFR), recruits a complex consisting of
TNF receptor-associated protein with the death domain
(TRADD) adaptor, receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP1),
TNF receptor associated factor-2 (TRAF2), and cellular
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2) (Figure 5)
[123, 125, 126]. RIP1 is Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated,
possibly by Ubc13/Uev1A [145] and the E3 ligase
TRAF2, but alternative types of polyubiquitin chains
could play the same role in a Ubc13-independent manner
[131]. NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO, also called

IKKγ) and TAB2/3 bind the Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains
to recruit the TAK1 and IKK kinases, leading to activation
of IKK [125, 136, 137, 146]. Interestingly, an intracellular
simulant of the NF-κB pathway called CC2D1A initiates
the above mentioned Ubc13/TRAF2-dependent signaling
similarly to TNFα receptor stimulation [147], however
further studies are required to uncover possible upstream
regulators of CC2D1A and provide a biological context
for its function.
Receptor stimulation by TNFα may also initiate an
IKK-independent signaling cascade, in which TRAF2 is
ubiquitinated by Ubc13 (likely pre-monoubiquitinated),

and translocated to insoluble cytoskeletal/membrane (lipid
raft) areas, leading to activation of JNK but not NF-κB or
p38 (Figure 5) [148]. Additionally, TNFR stimulation by
TNFα has been reported to activate JNK (also known as
SAPK), and germinal center kinase-related protein kinase
(GCKR or MEKKK3) in a TRAF2/Ubc13-dependent
manner, which may involve oligomerization and activation
of MEKK1 [145].
TNFα can also bind the TNFR-1 receptor and
signal an apoptotic response through Ubc13/RNF8mediated Lys63-linked ubiquitination of TNFR-1, which
causes internalization of the TNFR-1 receptor through
endocytosis (Figure 5). Upon internalization of TNFR-1,
the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is recruited,
and caspase-3/7 and -8 are activated leading to apoptosis
[149]. Results from UV stimulation of TNFR-1 support
a regulatory role for Ubc13 in apoptotic signaling [150].

Act1-dependent Lys63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 is
necessary for IL-17-mediated NF-κB activation, instead of
TRAF6/Ubc13-mediated auto-ubiquitination.

Involvement of Ubc13 in the negative regulation
of immune signaling
Immune and pro-inflammatory pathways are finely
tuned through the actions of immune repressors for
appropriate innate immune responses. Signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is one such
repressor found to negatively regulate Ubc13 expression
by the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine, which is itself
produced upon NF-κB-pathway induction as a negative
feedback loop [158]. Receptor activator of nuclear factor
κB (RANK) is a TNFR family member that is found on
the cell surface of osteoclast progenitor cells, which relies
on a Ubc13/TRAF6-dependent NF-κB response upon
activation [159-161]. Stimulation of macrophages with
IL-6 causes lowered Ubc13 mRNA and protein levels,
and the repressive transcriptional relationship between
STAT3 and Ubc13 was further demonstrated by chromatin
immunoprecipitation, quantitative PCR, and mutational
experiments [158]. In turn, antibody-mediated blocking
of IL-6, with cell surface RANK stimulation via RANK
ligand (RANKL) caused increased Ubc13 production in
marrow-derived macrophages [158]. STAT3 signaling was
shown to be further regulated by Ubc13-mediated Lys63linked ubiquitination of an IKK subunit [162].
Myc-interacting zinc-finger protein 1 (Miz1)
[163] and G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) [164]
are proteins shown to play anti-inflammatory roles by
antagonizing TNFα-stimulated Ubc13 association with
a RING E3 ligase (TRAF2/6) to create Lys63-linked
ubiquitin chains necessary for downstream JNK activation.
Upon TNFα receptor stimulation, Miz1 is targeted for
proteasomal degradation via Lys48 ubiquitination, but a
Miz1 mutant unable to be tagged with Lys48 ubiquitin
chains directly binds the TRAF2 RING domain and
prevents the formation of a TRAF2/Ubc13 complex
[163]. GPS2 is known as a transcriptional regulator, but
also functions in the cytoplasm in a non-transcriptional
capacity [164]. Yeast two-hybrid assays, GST pull-downs,
and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a
direct interaction of GPS2 with TRAF2 and Ubc13, with a
preference for ubiquitin conjugated Ubc13 (Ubc13~Ub).
GPS2-Ubc13 interactions did not disrupt Ubc13 binding
to Uev1A, but prevented in vitro TRAF2-dependent
polyubiquitin chain formation [164]. Intriguingly, GPS2
could bind Ubc13~Ub in such a way as to prevent the
previously mentioned conformational selection of the
donor ubiquitin from occupying the activated position.
Another protein recently identified to be a negative
regulator of the NF-κB pathway is A20 (TNFAIP3), which
has both deubiquitinase (cleaves Lys63-linked ubiquitin

Activation of noncanonical NF-κB pathway
receptors
Ubc13 is also involved in activation of the MAPKs,
JNK and p38. TNFR family receptor CD40 activation
leads to formation of an intracellular complex that includes
Ubc13, TRAF2, cIAP1/2, MEKK1, nuclear factor κβinducing kinase (NIK) and TRAF3 (Figure 5) [123, 151],
which is stabilized by TRAF2/Ubc13-mediated Lys63linked ubiquitination. TRAF3 is degraded via Lys48
ubiquitination-mediated proteasome targeting, which
releases the complex in the cytoplasm that then activates
JNK and p38 [151]. The transforming growth factor β
(TGFβ) cytokine stimulates type I and II Ser/Thr kinase
receptors (TβRI and TβRII) [152, 153], which initiates a
Ubc13-dependent non-SMAD signaling pathway [123].
Similar to TNFR and IL-1R/TLR signaling, upon TGFβ
receptor stimulation, Ubc13-dependent TRAF6 Lys63linked auto-ubiquitination leads to TAK1 activation and
the subsequent activation of MAP kinase kinases (MKK),
which in turn activate p38 and JNK (Figure 5) [123, 154,
155].

Role of Ubc13 in IL-17 receptor stimulation
A T helper 17 cell-produced proinflammatory
cytokine, interleukin-17 (IL-17), is important for
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and
multiple sclerosis and bacterial and fungal infections
[156, 157]. IL-17 binds to the interleukin-17 receptor
(IL-17R) A/C (IL-17RA/IL-17RC) complex to stimulate
multiple pathways including the Act1-dependent pathway
[156]. Act1 is a U-box E3 ligase shown to act with
Ubc13/Uev1A to Lys63-linked ubiquitinate (likely premonoubiquitinated) TRAF6 upon IL-17R stimulation. The
Act1-dependent Ubc13/Uev1A ubiquitination of TRAF6
leads to NF-κB activation. Liu et al. [157] showed that

chains [165]) and ubiquitination activities [166, 167].
As previously described, an important signaling step
upon TLR or IL-1R stimulation via LPS or IL-1β is the
association of Ubc13 with TRAF6 to make Lys63-linked
polyubiquitin chains on TRAF6, which leads to the
eventual activation of IKK and the translocation/activation
of the NF-κB transcription factor. A20 works with an
adaptor protein, Tax1 binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1),
to bind TRAF6 and prevent its interaction with Ubc13
[166]. In addition to blocking Ubc13/TRAF6 binding,
A20 facilitated Lys48-ubiquitination and degradation of
Ubc13 in primary bone marrow-derived dendritic cells
(BMDCs) and macrophages (BMDMs) after ~4-6 hours
of IL-1 treatment [166].

findings support a model in which ERAdP works through
the Ubc13-NF-κB system to drive IFN-γ production in NK
cells.

Ubc13 in cytoplasmic bacterial infection sensing
by NOD2
Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domaincontaining protein 2 (NOD2) is an intracellular,
cytoplasmic sensor of bacterial infection, specifically
binding muramyl dipeptide (MDP) on bacterial
peptidoglycans [175, 176]. NOD2 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with Blau
syndrome and Crohn’s disease, which are inflammatory
disorders [176, 177]. From an auto-inhibited state, NOD2
is activated by binding to MDP, which then binds RIP2,
effectively disrupting a RIP2/MEKK4 complex [176].
RIP2 is polyubiquitinated in a Ubc13/TRAF6 dependent
manner [178], and the subsequent recruitment of TAK1
leads to NF-κB activation [176]. Additionally, other E3
ligases may be able to functionally substitute for TRAF6
[177].

Role of Ubc13 in T cells
The adaptive immune response encompasses
antibody producing B cells and a variety of T cell types
[168]. T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) recognize major
histocompatibility complex (MHC)-presented antigenic
peptides on antigen presenting cells (APCs), which
activate TCR signaling pathways that can include NFκB activation and Ubc13 [168, 169]. Zhao et al. [170]
characterized a RING E3 ligase called T cell RING protein
identified in activation screen (TRAC-1), which has high
expression in lymphoid tissues, appears to positively
regulate T cell activation and can interact with Ubc13
to create Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. T cells
from mice with a mutated Ubc13 gene demonstrated
deficient NF-κB and MAP kinase activation [171]. A type
of T cell called regulatory T cell (Treg), suppresses the
immune system to prevent unchecked immune function
and inflammation through cytokine secretion and cellcell contact [172]. Ubc13 conditional knockdown in Treg
cells caused the cells to acquire an effector phenotype that
produced pro-inflammatory cytokines, which was shown
to involve Ubc13-IKK signaling [173].

Ubc13 involvement in implant inflammation
An unfortunate stimulant of inflammatory pathways
such as the NF-κB pathway are polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA) particles, which are shed from implants and
cause inflammatory osteolysis [179]. PMMA particles
increase inflammation by TAK1 activation, with the
induction of Ubc13 and TAK1 binding to NEMO, along
with TRAF6 binding to NEMO, suggests a route for NFκB pathway activation.

Ubc13 function in response to hypoxia
Hypoxia induces NF-κB activation through a
signaling cascade that is Ubc13-dependent [180], but is
initiated differently than those described earlier for the
NF-κB pathway. Culver et al. [180] demonstrated that NFκB activation via hypoxia requires calcium/calmodulindependent kinase 2 (CaMK2) and the presence of calcium
(Ca2+), which leads to TAK1/IKK/NF-κB activation.
Interestingly, hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation required
Ubc13, but not TRAF2/6, however XIAP (X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis protein) [181] is a candidate E3
ligase that could possibly function with Ubc13 in this
pathway [182]. Further, hypoxia did not lead to canonical
NF-κB pathway IκB degradation, but instead resulted in
increased sumoylation of IκB Lys21, which prevented its
degradation [180]. Interestingly, the sumoylation of IκB
seems to increase release of RelA (an NF-κB subunit)
suggesting an alternative mode of NF-κB activation,
which was demonstrated through desumoylation enzyme

Ubc13 role in IFN-γ production in natural killer
(NK) cells
Another component of the innate immune system
are natural killer (NK) cells, which can kill infected or
transformed cells directly and can also secrete cytokines
such as IFN-γ. Chen et al. identified an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) membrane protein called ER adaptor
protein (ERAdP) that is constitutively expressed in
NK cells and can activate NK cells likely through
Ubc13-dependent NF-κB pathway activation. ERAdP
directly interacts with Ubc13, as demonstrated through
recombinant and cellular co-immunoprecipitations
[174]. Ubc13 conjugation to ubiquitin (Ubc13~Ub) was
enhanced in the presence of ERAdP, and Ubc13 was
shown to be required for IFN-γ production. Together, these

depletion experiments. One percent oxygen was used as
a hypoxic condition in the Culver et al. experiments. It
should be noted that many cell culture experiments are
performed at atmospheric oxygen levels of ~21%, however
cellular oxygen levels within a mammal are estimated to
be closer to 5% (range of ~1-11%). This difference may
have important consequences for oxidative metabolism
and experimental results in at least lymphocytes and
neurons [183-185]. Hydroxylation of Ubc13 may also
play a role in hypoxic IL-1β-induced signaling, but
further direct evidence of regulatory importance of this
modification is required [186].

TAK1 complex that promotes IKK activation. NEMO is
required for TAK1 activation and its polyubiquitin binding
is required for activation of IKK, but not of TAK1. ELKS
is also Lys63-linked ubiquitinated, which is facilitated by
the E3 ligase XIAP, and likely Ubc13. Collectively, the
Wu et al. results describe components of an ATM- and
Ubc13-dependent signaling cascade that activates the NFκB transcription factor in response to DNA damage [188].
In one instance of DDR-NF-κB pathway crosstalk,
a factor involved in the NF-κB pathway was shown to be
involved in the DDR. A protein called B-cell lymphoma/
leukemia 10 (BCL10) participates in the activation of the
NF-κB pathway in B and T cells, which involves TRAF6/
Ubc13/Uev1A-mediated Lys63-linked ubiquitination
of NEMO and subsequent activation of TAK1-IKK and
NF-κB [197-199]. BCL10 was recently shown to be
phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA damage, to
colocalize with DNA damage dependent ɣH2AX foci and
to participate in HR repair factor recruitment to sites of
damage [197, 200]. BCL10 also associates with RNF8,
and this seems to be partially dependent on the RNF8 FHA
domain. The authors offer the suggestion that RNF8 FHA
may bind to BCL10 (Thr91) TQXF motif (known to be
targets for phosphorylation) [197]. RNF8 ubiquitinates
BCL10 predominantly with Lys63-linked ubiquitin
chains, which requires the previously mentioned BCL10
phosphorylation and likely pre-monoubiquitination.
Zhao et al. found that upon siRNA-mediated knockdown
of BCL10 expression, the binding of RNF8 and Ubc13
was diminished. They conclude that “BCL10 presents
Ubc13 to RNF8,” however the fact that Ubc13 and RNF8
efficiently bind in vitro, suggests that perhaps BCL10
disrupts association of either Ubc13 or RNF8 with another
factor, which allows their subsequent binding.

Crosstalk between the DDR and
NF-κB pathways involves Ubc13
Mechanistic insight into how DNA damage activates
the NF-κB transcription factor has been uncovered [187,
188]. In 2010, two simultaneously published studies
showed major roles of the DDR regulatory kinase ATM
and Ubc13 in DDR-dependent activation of NF-κB,
although the details of signaling differs between the two
studies. Hinz et al. showed that DNA damage induces two
parallel signaling streams that converge into one in the
cytoplasm to activate NF-κB [187]. Upon DNA damage
ATM [189-191] and poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1
(PARP-1) [192-195] are recruited to DNA DSBs. In
one DDR-dependent NF-κB activation stream DNA
damage-activated ATM translocates from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm, which was abolished in the presence of a
calcium chelator, indicating calcium dependence [187].
It was demonstrated through pull-down experiments
in cell extracts that ATM contains a conserved motif
that directly binds endogenous TRAF6 and promotes
its polyubiquitination via Ubc13. Polyubiquitinated
TRAF6 subsequently recruits cIAP1, which causes
NEMO monoubiquitination, and TAB2-dependent
phosphorylation of TAK1 leading to downstream
IKK-NF-κB activation. In the other stream of DDRdependent NF-κB activation, nuclear PARP-1 synthesis
of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains induces complex
formation of ATM, NEMO, and the SUMO1 E3 ligase
PIAS4 (or PIASy) [196], which results in sumoylation and
possibly phosphorylation of NEMO [187]. Interestingly,
the sumoylated NEMO translocates to the cytoplasm
and acts as the substrate for the previously mentioned
NEMO monoubiquitination, which eventually leads to
downstream NF-κB activation.
The second study that showed a major role of
the DDR regulatory kinase ATM and Ubc13 in DDRdependent activation of NF-κB also involves NEMO,
TAK1, TAB2/3, IKK, XIAP, and a protein rich in
glutamate, leucine, lysine, and serine (ELKS) [188].
Wu et al. demonstrated that upon DNA damage, ATM
phosphorylates NEMO Ser85, which results in a Ubc13,
Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain, TAB2/3-dependent ELKS/

diverse

Ubc13 role in the regulation of p53
A few studies have reported an interesting proteinprotein interaction between Ubc13 and p53 involved
in the DDR and transcription/translation regulation.
The distribution of p53 in the cell depends on the level
of differentiation, where p53 is largely cytoplasmic in
undifferentiated cells and many cancer cell lines, while
many differentiated cell lines exhibit predominantly
nuclear/perinuclear p53 [201-207]. Laine et al. showed
that Ubc13 regulates the subcellular distribution of
p53 through its ubiquitination activity [208]. They
uncovered a direct interaction between the C-terminus
of p53 and Ubc13 that requires either Mms2 or Uev1A
(i.e. the functional E2 heterodimer) and this interaction
has also been observed in a zebrafish system [209]. The

Mdm2-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent
proteasomal degradation of p53 is suppressed by Lys63linked ubiquitination via Ubc13, although mono-/
di-ubiquitination of p53 is unaffected by Ubc13. This
Ubc13-dependent ubiquitination also prevents p53
tetramerization, attenuates its transcriptional activity,
and localizes it to the cytoplasm [208]. Interestingly,
these Ubc13-dependent changes to the state of p53 are
diminished upon IR, which may reflect the need for their
individual participation in the DDR. This is also likely
due, in part, to p53-mediated downregulation of Ubc13
expression upon DNA damage [208]. The same group
also found a p53/Ubc13 association on actively translating
polysomes [210].
Interestingly, Solozobova et al. found that
embryonic stem cell (ES) lines have high p53 expression
compared to a differentiated cell line, mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) [206], but with a lower half-life,
indicating decreased protein stability. siRNA knockdown
of Ubc13 caused a reduction in Mdm2 and p53 amounts
in ES cells, establishing a functional relationship between
Ubc13 and p53 in ES cells.

linked polyubiquitin are found in these cells dependent
on Triad1. Taken together, this study suggests that the
ability of the Triad1 E3 to drive formation of both kinds
of polyubiquitin is critical for its role in the control of
myeloid proliferation.

Role of Ubc13 in ER-associated degradation
(ERAD)
The ERAD system is part of an important cellular
process that employs ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis
to deal with unfolded/misfolded proteins. RING finger
protein 5 (RNF5) is an ER-anchored E3 ligase that
regulates misfolded protein degradation. JNK-associated
membrane protein (JAMP) facilitates and increases ERAD
through association with proteasome components such
as gp78 and p97 [217]. RNF5 regulates the response to
misfolded/unfolded proteins by functioning with Ubc13
to form Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains on JAMP, which
prevents JAMP association with the proteasomal and
ERAD components, Rpt4/5/6 and p97, respectively; this in
turn diminishes the ability of JAMP to act as a proteasomal
scaffold [217].

Hematopoiesis involves Ubc13 activity

Ubc13
in
neural
development
neurodegenerative diseases

Ubc13 has been shown to play a role in
hematopoiesis [211, 212]. Wu et al. [211] generated
Ubc13 conditional knockout mice, as Ubc13 knockout
was embryonic lethal [213]. Ubc13 deficiency had a
serious effect on the bone marrow, mesenteric lymph
nodes, thymus and spleen which affected the production
of platelets, and white (WBC) and red blood cells
(RBC). Due to an established role of Wnt signaling in
hematopoiesis [214, 215], Wu et al. investigated important
steps in Wnt signaling such as the stabilization of β-catenin
and subsequent transcription of the Wnt target genes,
Lef1, Ccnd1, Tcf1, and Axin2 [211]. Elevated expression
of the Wnt target genes and stabilized β-catenin suggested
a negative regulatory role for Ubc13 in Wnt signaling that
has important implications for hematopoiesis.
Triad1 (2 RING fingers and DRIL (double RING
finger linked) 1) is a primarily nuclear RING-betweenRING (RBR) E3 ligase that uses an active site cysteine
and RING domains to transfer ubiquitin to a substrate
[7]. Triad1 functions in the inhibition of clonogenic
growth and subsequent maturation of immature blood
cells into monocytes and granulocytes [212, 216]. Coimmunoprecipitations in human cells and in vitro surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrated
Triad1 binding to Ubc13 and Ubc13/Mms2, respectively.
Interestingly, the RING1 domain of Triad1 is necessary
for interaction with UbcH7 to form Lys48-linked ubiquitin
chains, whereas RING2 is needed for interaction with
Ubc13 to form Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains [212]. Both
RING1 and RING2 are required for Triad1 function in
blood cell differentiation, and both Lys48- and Lys63www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Early studies demonstrated a role for the
Drosophila ortholog of Ubc13, Bendless (Ben), in neural
development [218-223]. Ben is necessary for synaptic
transmission between the giant fiber neuron and both the
tergotrochanteral muscle (TTM) [222] and tibial levator
muscle (TLM) motor neurons [223]. Further, flies lacking
Ben showed abnormal thoracic muscle organization,
decreased mobility of newly hatched flies, and increased
mortality in late pupal stages [221]. A study showing
Ben mutant defects in the visual system and increased
Ben RNA transcript expression in the Drosophila
nervous system during embryo development, suggested a
prominent role for Ben in early neural development [218].
Ben was demonstrated to be essential for the pre-synaptic
initiation of synapse formation for subsequent synaptic
growth and development [224]. Ben was shown to be
important for long-term memory, which suggested a postdevelopmental role of Ben in the nervous system [225].
Ubc13 is involved in two neurodegenerative
diseases characterized by protein misfolding, Huntington’s
disease (HD) [226] and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [227230]. The primary feature of HD is the variable DNA
repeat expansion of CAG in the huntingtin (HTT)
gene [231, 232], which translates into a huntingtin
protein (or fragment) with a lengthened N-terminal
polyglutamine region prone to aggregation in neurons
and accumulation in synaptic regions [233]. In their
study, Yin et al. examined the brain tissues of rhesus

monkeys using a cellular fractionation technique that
isolates synaptosomes [226], which are artificial vesicles
formed through centrifugal-induced severing of the
axon terminals from neurons that comprise the synaptic
components [234]. Ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal
activity in brain tissues, but not the muscle or liver,
decreased with the age of monkey, while there was an
increase in ubiquitin-conjugates [226]. There was also an
age-dependent increase in Ubc13 expression in monkey
brain tissues, but not muscle or liver tissues. Interestingly,
experiments in which Ubc13 siRNA and huntingtin
mutant constructs were co-transfected into cultured cells
demonstrated that inhibition of Ubc13 expression caused
a decrease in mutant huntingtin aggregates in human
HEK293 and rat PC12 cells. Immunoprecipitations in
transfected cells showed that one of the mutant huntingtin
constructs (exon 1-97Q) was more heavily ubiquitinated
with Lys63-linked chains than Lys48. The authors also
found that shRNA silencing of Ubc13 in HD model mice
(brains) significantly decreased aggregation of full-length
mutant huntingtin [226]. Collectively, this data suggests
that Ubc13 may play an important role in huntingtin
accumulation in neurons and neurotoxicity in HD.
Predominant features of PD include the presence of
protein-rich inclusions in neurons called Lewy bodies, the
decline in dopaminergic neurons in the brain [235], and
dysfunctional mitochondria [227]. Parkin is a RBR E3
ligase involved in the pathogenesis of PD [236], which is
thought to be related to the lysosome-autophagy pathway
[235]. Autophagy is a process that isolates a section of
the cytoplasm in a double membrane vesicle called the
autophagosome, that then fuses with the lysosome,
unloading the enveloped contents into the acidic lysosome
environment for degradation [237]. Tan et al. demonstrated
that Lys63-linked ubiquitination promotes the formation
of protein aggregates/inclusions in a human cell line and
that Lys63-linked ubiquitin aggregates are preferentially
targeted for autophagy [238]. Further, Lim et al. has
shown that Ubc13 is recruited to function with Parkin and
the degree of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination is increased
when the proteasome is inhibited under conditions
of proteolytic stress [230]. Additionally, proteasome
inhibition of Ubc13 knockout MEFs compared to wild
type suggests a Ubc13-mediated protective function for
cells during proteolytic stress. A likely target of Ubc13/
Parkin-mediated lysosome-autophagy is the DUB
ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), which is
itself important for neurological function, as mutations in
UCH-L1 cause neurodegenerative disorders [228].
Parkin is involved in mitophagy, a process in which
mitochondria that have been damaged are selected for
removal [239]. Previous hypotheses that Ubc13/Parkinmediated Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains on damaged/
stressed mitochondria promoted mitophagy have been
shown to be untrue [229], and instead these chains appear
to promote mitochondrial fusions (mitofusions) [227].

Small non-coding RNAs called micro-RNAs
(miRNAs) have previously been shown to regulate
gene expression and to be involved in radio- and drugresistance of cancer cells [240, 241]. Zhang et al. showed
that a miRNA, miR-205, represses the expression of
Ubc13 and the transcription factor zinc finger E-box
binding homeobox1 (ZEB1), which effectively impedes
the DDR [241]. In response to ionizing radiation (IR),
tumor cells downregulate miR-205 expression [242].
Downregulation of miR-205 in response to IR would
increase tumor radioresistance due to enhanced DNA
repair. Zhang et al. demonstrated the therapeutic potential
of miR-205, through nanoliposomal delivery of miR-205
to radioresistant tumor cells and xenograft tumors, which
had a significant radiosensitizing effect [241].

Role of Ubc13 in thymidine synthesis
The folate-dependent biosynthesis of thymidine
nucleotide is important for cell growth and replication,
and depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) pools
results in genome instability [243, 244]. The input
material for synthesis of thymidine monophosphate
(TMP) is methylenetetrahydrofolate (methyleneTHF),
which is used by the enzyme thymidylate synthase to
convert deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) into
deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) [243]. Serine
hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is the enzyme that
generates methyleneTHF from THF and serine. The
regeneration of THF uses NADPH and dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR). Ubc13 is involved in the regulation
of SHMT1 through Lys63-linked ubiquitination and
subsequent nuclear export of SHMT1, which leads to
degradation of SHMT1 in the cytoplasm [243, 245]. The
Ubc13-dependent Lys63-linked ubiquitin modification
of SHMT1 may also compete with SUMO-dependent
degradation of SHMT1 in the nucleus [243].

Ubc13 involvement in mitotic checkpoints
Ubc13 functions with the RING E3 ligase,
checkpoint with FHA and RING domains (Chfr), in an
early mitosis checkpoint pathway [37, 246, 247]. In 2000,
Scolnick and Halazonetis uncovered a Chfr-dependent
pathway in human cell lines that delays mitotic transition
from prophase to metaphase under mitotic stress and
found that Chfr is mutated or not expressed in four cancer
cell lines [246]. The same research group later found that
Chfr functions with Ubc13/Mms2 to make Lys63-linked
ubiquitin chains in vitro [37]. More recently, genetic
evidence has suggested that in yeast Ubc13 may function
with Chfr homologs to delay the cell cycle, suggesting

conservation of this pathway [247].

al. [257] found that Ubc13 interacts with two RING E3
ligases, ZNRF1 and ZNRF2 (ZNRF1/2) and that ZNRF1/2
stimulates Ubc13 Lys63-linked ubiquitination activity.
Na+/K+ ATPase is composed of an α- and β-subunit, for
which the α-subunit is known to mediate many proteinprotein interactions [256]. ZNRF1/2 can interact with
the Na+/K+ ATPase α-subunit through their ubiquitinbinding UBZ domains, however mutation of the UBZ
zinc-binding cysteines to alanine did not abolish ZNRF1
interaction with Na+/K+ ATPase α-subunit, suggesting
this interaction is not mediated by ubiquitin. The role of
ZNRF1/2 is likely related to the signaling involved in the
regulation of the levels of Na+/K+ ATPase in the plasma
membrane, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZNRF2
prevented ouabain (a Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor) from
reducing Na+/K+ ATPase levels in the plasma membrane
[257]. Collectively, the results suggest Ubc13 may
play a role in the regulation of Na+/K+ ATPase through
intracellular signaling activities, but direct evidence of
Ubc13 involvement is still required [257].

Ubc13 participation in growth hormone signaling
Growth hormone (GH) signaling is critical to
adolescent longitudinal bone growth, bone mass,
maturation of the skeletal system, and maintenance of
bone mass in adults [248]. The 191 amino acid GH peptide
binds to a class I cytokine receptor called growth hormone
receptor (GHR) [248, 249]. Cells can regulate their
sensitivity to GH by controlling the amount of cell surface
GHRs through endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal
degradation of GHRs [250]. Slotman et al. demonstrated
that U-box E3 CHIP binds GHR and likely works with
Ubc13 to form Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains, which play
a role in proper signaling for GHR endocytosis. Both
Ubc13 and CHIP were shown to be necessary for GHR
endocytosis [250].

Involvement of arabidopsis Ubc13 in auxin
signaling

Possible involvement of Ubc13 in regulation of cell
motility

Ubc13/Uev1A is conserved in plants with a role
in DNA damage tolerance/repair [251, 252] and root
development [253]. Auxin is a small molecule plant
hormone that is important for root development and
organization [254]. A double mutant of the Arabidopsis
Ubc13 genes demonstrated root development defects
including shorter primary roots, and reduced number
of lateral roots, and root-hair density [253]. Wen et
al. compared endogenous levels of auxin in wild type
and Ubc13 null plants and found the mutant to contain
about half the amount of auxin. Treatment of wild type
and Ubc13 mutant plants with a synthetic auxin [255],
α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), revealed the response
to auxin and subsequent root development to be dependent
on Ubc13 [253].

Focal adhesions are major points of contact between
cells and the external framework that stabilizes them,
the extracellular matrix (ECM) [258, 259]. Paxillin is
an adaptor that mediates crosstalk between signaling
proteins and the cytoskeleton [258], and is involved in
signaling at focal adhesions necessary for cell motility
[259]. Didier et al. established the RING E3 RNF5 as
a mediator of paxillin localization, demonstrating that
RNF5 targets paxillin for ubiquitination, which decreases
the presence of paxillin at focal adhesions and increases
its cytoplasmic concentration without increasing paxillin
degradation [259]. Due to a lack of RNF5-induced paxillin
degradation, Ubc13 was hypothesized to work with RNF5
to create Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains, and this ability
was confirmed in vitro. Expression of an inactive mutant
of Ubc13 in human cells inhibited RNF5-mediated
ubiquitination, which in combination with a lack of
RNF5-mediated degradation led Didier et al. to suggest
that Ubc13 likely works with RNF5 to target paxillin for
ubiquitination [259]. Additionally, RNF5 was found to
affect cell motility in paxillin-null cells, which suggested
that RNF5 may be involved in targeting other cell motilityrelated proteins. Further studies are required to provide
direct evidence for a role of Ubc13 in cell motility.

Role of Ubc13 in sodium/potassium pump
regulation
Ubc13 is involved in the regulation of the sodium/
potassium ATPase (Na+/K+ ATPase), a plasma membranebound ATP-driven ion transporter that transports Na+
and K+ against their concentration gradients to form an
electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane
[256]. The proper balance of sodium/potassium ions is
critical to a plethora of fundamental cellular processes,
such as electrical excitability, nutrient uptake, pH, and
regulation of cell volume, among others. Protein-protein
interactions between the Na+/K+ ATPase and multiple
intracellular partners regulate diverse cellular signaling
pathways (reviewed by Reinhard et al. [256]). Hoxhak et

Ubc13 in fertilization and spermatogenesis
Ubc13 plays a role in sexual reproduction,
specifically spermatogenesis and fertilization. During
meiosis there is exchange of genetic information between
64486

Oncotarget

homologous chromosomes through meiotic recombination,
which requires the generation of numerous DSBs that are
repaired after recombination [260]. Due to little homology
between the X and Y sex chromosomes, there is an
extended DNA repair period with prolonged presence of
DNA damage repair proteins in the largely unsynapsed XY
body structure [260]. There was little to no detection of
Ubc13 at XY body DNA structures in male mice during
spermatogenesis, suggesting Ubc13 may not be involved
in DNA repair of the induced DSBs [261]. However in
a separate study Ubc13 mRNA transcripts were shown
to be highly expressed in mouse testes [262]. Androgen
suppression caused DNA damage through oxidative stress
and proteomics studies identified Ubc13 as a gene among
those upregulated in male rat meiotic cells in response to
androgen suppression. Increased Ubc13 in oxidative stress
conditions in the testes likely reflects the role of Ubc13 in
DNA repair pathways such as template switching (Figure
4) [263]. Endocytosis of maternal membrane proteins upon
egg fertilization and subsequent late endosome sorting
may involve Ubc13-mediated Lys63-linked ubiquitination
in humans, as shown in Caenorhabditis elegans [264].
Several consecutive miscarriages prior to twenty
weeks of gestation warrants a recurrent miscarriage
(RM) diagnosis [265]. As previously discussed Ubc13
is important for Treg cell-mediated suppression of
inappropriate immune responses. Upon fertilization, the
zygote contains both maternal and paternal DNA, but
is hosted in the mother’s body, whose immune system
therefore must quickly build a tolerance for the malederived antigens of the zygote [265]. Liu et al. examined
the frequency of Treg cells with sperm antigen specificity
(SASTreg) for their husbands’ sperm in women with RM,
which would be indicative of the female immune tolerance
to the male’s antigens [265]. RM women expressed less
Ubc13 mRNA and protein, and had an overall lower
frequency of SASTreg cells than the control group [265].
Consistent with previous results [173], Liu et al. found that
Ubc13 knockdown induced Treg cells to acquire effector
T cell functions. The lowered Ubc13 expression in RM
women would therefore be expected to have a negative
effect on maternal immune tolerance for the paternal
sperm.

Roles of Ubc13 in
cellular infections

virus (HIV)-1 [266-269]. TRIM5 promotes innate
immune signaling pathways, including the previously
discussed NF-κB pathway [267]. TRIM5 oligomerizes
and recognizes retroviral capsids, and participates with
Ubc13/Uev1A to form free Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains
in the cytoplasm, which activate TAK1, resulting in the
subsequent activation of the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription
factors [267]. TRIM5 likely uses the previously discussed
E3-dependent conformational selection to stimulate
Ubc13~Ub/Uev1A E2 activity, and this is dependent on
TRIM5 dimerization, which is facilitated by retroviral
capsid binding [269].

Viral proteins hijack Ubc13 upon infection
Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a
disease that is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus
type 1 (HTLV-1) that develops after a long 40-60 year
latent period in three to five percent of people infected
[270]. HTLV-1 targets T lymphocytes (CD4+), but can
also infect myeloid and dendritic cells leading to HTLV1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. The
major HTLV oncoprotein, Tax, hijacks host cell signaling
pathways, including the NF-κB pathway [270]. Shembade
et al. determined that Tax is primarily Lys63-linked
ubiquitinated and also performed immunoprecipitation
assays in cells expressing Tax to demonstrate that Tax
binds Ubc13, an interaction necessary to facilitate Tax
binding to NEMO [271]. Ultimately, the Tax-dependent
Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains formed by Ubc13 are used
to aggregate signaling proteins and activate TAK1 and
the IKK complex [272, 273]. Additionally, Tax-mediated
Ubc13 activation may involve the RING E3 ligase, RNF8
[273].
Many viruses use a strategy to evade the immune
systems of host organisms whereby viral signaling proteins
stop the host cell from presenting viral components on the
host cell surface through the major histocompatibility
complex class I (MHC I) molecules. The MHC I-presented
viral components are recognized by the host cytotoxic T
(Tc) cells, which targets the infected cells for extermination
[274, 275]. Kaposi’s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) causes
Kaposi’s sarcoma cancer and employs a ubiquitin E3
ligase K3, which contains a RING-CH domain similar to
classical RING domains, to target MHC I molecules on the
host cell plasma membrane for endocytosis and lysosomal
degradation [275, 276]. Duncan et al. demonstrated that K3
binds UbcH5b/c to first monoubiquitinate the intracellular
side of MHC I molecules and subsequently binds Ubc13
to Lys63-linked ubiquitinate the monoubiquitinated
MHC I molecules [274, 275]. The ubiquitinated MHC
I molecules are endocytosed, which requires the UIMcontaining endocytosis adaptor epsin and clathrin [277].
The use of viral E3s to manipulate infected host cells
through modulation of E2 enzymes is likely a widespread
viral strategy. In addition to viral Tax-mediated E2/E3

cell immune signaling by preventing protein complexes
involved in TLR4-induced signaling from translocation
from the membrane to the cytoplasm, affecting the levels
of membrane-associated Ubc13 and decreasing Lys63linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 [291]. Collectively the
effects of L. donovani are thought to lower the production
of proinflammatory cytokines likely through modulation
of signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation.

Ubc13 in the response to bacterial infections
Shigella flexneri is a pathogenic bacterium that
causes the human intestinal disease shigellosis by invasion
of the intestinal epithelial cells [280]. S. flexneri encodes
a glutamine deamidase protein, OspI, which is secreted
from the bacteria to modulate host cell signaling [281].
OspI targets and deamidates host cellular Ubc13 at
Gln100, which converts it to a glutamic acid residue and
impairs its binding to TRAF6 to effectively inhibit NF-κB
activation [281]. Multiple studies of OspI/Ubc13 complex
crystal structures reveal the mode of OspI binding to
Ubc13, which notably overlaps with known E3 and DUB
binding surfaces [282, 283]. Interestingly, Shigella flexneri
employs a similar strategy to further manipulate the host
cell ability to fight the infection, through binding of its
OspG effector kinase to the ubiquitin conjugated host E2
enzymes (E2~Ub), UbcH5 and UbcH7 [284, 285]. OspG
also targets the NF-κB pathway, by preventing degradation
of IκB (Figure 5).
The enteropathogenic Escherichia coli bacterium
manipulates the host immune system through production
of a methyltransferase protein, NleE [286]. Instead of
targeting Ubc13 directly, NleE modifies zinc finger
cysteines of TAB2/3 (Figure 5), which disrupts the critical
Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain binding capacity of TAB2/3.
NleE activity was shown to suppress NF-κB activation
[286].
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that causes
chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract
that can lead to the onset of gastric cancers and other
ailments [287]. Upon infection, H. pylori activates the
NF-κB pathway and causes an increase in host cell proinflammatory cytokines [288]. Lamb et al. demonstrated
that an H. pylori protein, CagA, binds TAK1 and enhances
its Lys63-linked ubiquitination, thereby activating the NFκB pathway [289] in a Ubc13/Uev1A dependent manner
[288].

Ubc13 role in cancer and
development of anti-cancer
drug resistance
Two recent studies have strongly linked Ubc13
to regulation of breast cancer metastasis [155, 292].
As previously described above, TGF leads to p38 and
JNK activation through a non-SMAD signaling cascade
that depends on Ubc13/TRAF6 Lys63-linked autoubiquitination to activate TAK1 and the downstream
MAP kinases. It was demonstrated that Ubc13 is
upregulated in tumor tissue samples of the breast, prostate,
colon, pancreas and in lymphoma [155, 293] and that
upregulated Ubc13 in breast cancer is correlated with
reduced survival. Xenograft studies of breast cancer in a
mouse model system showed that Ubc13 expression was
not strongly linked to primary tumor growth, however
Ubc13 expression was required for the development
of metastasis [155]. The authors also found that Ubc13
silencing in the LM2 human breast cancer cell line
inhibited TGFβ-induced activation of p38, but not JNK
activation. Rescue of the Ubc13-silencing effect by the
expression of a constitutively active MKK downstream
of Ubc13 in the pathway demonstrated correct pathway
identification of the Ubc13-p38 signaling as responsible
for the breast cancer cell metastasis [155]. Additionally,
Uev1A overexpression in a different breast cancer cell
line (MDA-MB-231) promoted metastasis in a Ubc13dependent manner, which was attributed to activation
of the NF-κB transcription factor [292]. Finally, further
support for a role of Ubc13 in cancer metastasis has come
from a study of Ubc13/Uev1A orthologs in Drosophila
that demonstrated a regulatory role of Ubc13/Uev1A in
JNK-dependent tumor metastasis and growth [294-296].
Cisplatin is a well-known, frequently used
chemotherapeutic agent that primarily causes purine baselinked DNA inter- and intrastrand crosslinks. Cisplatinmediated DNA crosslinks stall DNA replication, which
leads to collapse of replication forks and subsequent
generation of DNA DSBs [297]. Unfortunately, anticancer drugs such as cisplatin provide a selective pressure,
leading to the evolution of resistant cancer cells. Su et al.
found that chronic cisplatin treatment of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) cells results in upregulated expression
of the TS, FA and HR DNA repair pathways. Cisplatinresistant NPC cells (cr-NPCs) show increased Ubc13
expression, and have a higher frequency of sister

Ubc13 targeting in parasitic infections
Modulation of host immune responses by the
ubiquitination system is not only limited to viral and
bacterial infections, but also plays a role in how cells
respond to parasitic infections. Leishmania donovani is a
parasite that infects macrophages, which can cause them
to undergo apoptosis [290]. L. donovani is responsible
for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) disease, which causes
enlargement of the spleen and liver, and can result in death.
Gupta et al. demonstrate that L. donovani modulates host

chromatid exchange (SCE). Depletion of Ubc13, as well
as other DNA repair genes, resensitized the cr-NPCs to
cisplatin and suppressed SCE [297]. Similarly, a study in
fission yeast found deletion mutants of Ubc13 render yeast
hypersensitive to cisplatin [298].
cBioPortal is a database of sequenced cancer
genomes, which maps mutations from a large pool of
samples for a given protein onto its structure if one is
available [299]. The functional impact of a given mutation
in a cancer is largely based on residue conservation in
protein families, and mutations are rated low, medium,
or high, with medium/high ranked as possible driver
mutations [300]. It is therefore likely that differences
in populations and genetics may result in differences in
the effects of Ubc13 mutations in cancers and cancer
susceptibility, as for example, one study found a lack of
breast cancer predisposition with mutations in Ubc13,
Mms2, and RNF8 in a Northern Finnish population [301].
Ubc13 cancer mutations in positions likely to disrupt
the active site structure are Thr73Ile (liver), Ile75Met
(uterine), Pro78Leu (melanoma), and Arg85Ile/Lys (lung
adenocarcinoma/multiple myeloma). Ubc13 mutations that
could destabilize the loop that opposes the active site (114124) are Ser113Thr (liver) and Ala126Val (colorectal).
Active site structure-disrupting mutations and active
site loop mutations would likely hinder proper transfer
of the covalently linked donor ubiquitin from the E2 to
an acceptor lysine on a substrate or another ubiquitin.
This would likely lead to impairment of DDR factor
recruitment to the sites of DNA DSBs and disruption of
immune signaling pathways. It is possible then, that these
particular cancers may have inefficient HR repair, which
could possibly be exploited in treatment strategies, such
as synthetic-lethality or sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.
Additionally, the cancers with Ubc13 active site mutations
may rely on non-Ubc13 dependent pro-survival pathways,
which could be selectively targeted to kill the cancer cells.
Ubc13 Arg70Leu/Cys (lung/stomach adenocarcinoma)
mutations likely affect Mms2 binding, as Arg70 hydrogen
bonds to the main chain carbonyl of Mms2 Met41. These
mutations may cause Ubc13 to be less specific for creating
Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains, and likely disrupt ubiquitin
chain formation altogether [302]. The Ubc13 mutation
Arg7Ser is found in liver hepatocellular carcinoma and
small cell lung cancer. It is predicted to have a high
functional impact due to its high degree of sequence
conservation. Arg7 makes hydrogen bonding interactions
that stabilize Ubc13 internal structure and may facilitate
E3 interactions. An internal hydrogen bond is formed with
the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Leu99, which is the
first residue C-terminal to the conserved Ubc13 Ser-ProAla motif important for RNF8 binding [38] and likely
other E3s such as CHIP [32]. Ubc13 Arg7 also likely
hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl oxygen
of RNF8 Ile405, which may be a major E2 selectivity
determinant. The effects of the Ubc13 Arg7Ser mutation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

would likely destabilize E3 binding, which could cause
major defects in DDR repair factor recruitment and
possibly other pathways where Lys63-linked ubiquitin
chains are necessary.

Ubc13 as a target for inhibitor
development
There has been considerable interest in discovering
and developing Ubc13 inhibitors, largely owing to the
role of Ubc13 in various DDR and cytoplasmic signaling
pathways linked to cancer. Several natural compounds
isolated from marine sponge species with proposed
activity against Ubc13 have been reported, including a
β-carboline alkaloid isolated from Luffariella variabilis
[303], manadosterols A/B from Lissodendryx fibrosa
[304], and leucettamol A from Leucetta aff. microrhaphis
[305]. Small-molecule inhibitors of Ubc13 have also
been discovered including Ubc13/Uev1A protein-protein
antagonists [306], and active site-targeting covalent
inhibitors [27, 307-309]. The β-carboline alkaloid isolated
from Luffariella variabilis was reported to inhibit Ubc13
interaction with Uev1A using an in vitro ELISA assay
(IC50 of 20 µM), and also had inhibitory effects on the
proteasome [303]. The manadosterol A/B inhibitors were
also reported to inhibit Ubc13 interaction with Uev1A with
IC50 values of 0.09 and 0.13 µM for manadosterol A and
B, respectively [304]. The inhibition of Ubc13/Uev1A by
manadosterol A/B compounds were also monitored using
an in vitro ELISA assay. Leucettamol A from Leucetta aff.
microrhaphis was the first reported marine sponge-derived
inhibitor of Ubc13 interaction with Uev1A, with an IC50 of
106 µM as determined by an in vitro ELISA assay [304,
305].
A report in 2012 [310] employed time-resolved
fluorescent resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) to
identify and characterize a small-molecule Ubc13
inhibitor, ML307. The report suggested that ML307
has a sub-micromolar affinity for Ubc13, with an IC50
of 781 nM. We, however, did not detect any inhibition
of diubiquitin production by Ubc13/Mms2 in the
concentration range of 2-80 µM, nor any inhibition of
polyubiquitin chain production in the presence of a RING
E3 ligase construct (RNF8345-485/Ubc13/Mms2) in the
concentration range of 1-10 µM (unpublished data).
Scheper et al. used a library of N-alkylglycine
derivatives termed peptoids to screen for Ubc13-Uev1A
interaction inhibitors using a yeast-two hybrid assay, along
with virtual screening. They identified two compounds
they named compounds Ia and IIa, and with surface
plasmon resonance-determined IC50 values of 10 pM
and 1.1 µM, respectively [306]. Several in vitro assays
suggested that both compounds inhibited Ubc13 binding
to Uev1A, as well as ubiquitination activity. Additionally,
several assays done using HeLa cells suggest compound Ia
inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB activation [306].

Pulvino et al. carried out a HTS screen for
compounds that inhibit NF-κB-mediated gene expression
and uncovered the compound NSC697923 as a Ubc13
small-molecule inhibitor [307]. The structurally related
compound BAY 11-7082, previously thought to inhibit
IKKs, was also recently identified as a relatively nonspecific E2 inhibitor [308]. Our group [27] and Strickson
et al. [308] confirmed both NSC697923 and BAY 11-7082
to be covalent inhibitors of Ubc13, and our lab solved
co-crystal structures of both inhibitors bound to Ubc13
in 2015. Both NSC697923 and BAY 11-7082 inhibit
NF-κB activation and the DDR [27, 307, 308]. Based on
our structural data, we designed a mutant that changes
the orientation of the Ubc13 active site loop, blocks the
pocket that the inhibitor-adducts would occupy, and
effectively resists NSC697923 in vitro, but maintains
the ability to build ubiquitin chains. Ubc13-knockout
MEFs reconstituted with the resistant mutant showed
significant resistance to inhibition in DNA damage and
NF-κB signaling by NSC697923 compared to a wild
type control. This study demonstrates that compounds
related to NSC697923 offer promise for the selective
inhibition of Ubc13 over other possible E2 enzymes [27].
The BAY 11-7082 compound is a less specific inhibitor
compared to NSC697923 and also inhibits protein tyrosine
phosphatases [27, 311]. Interestingly, both inhibitors
target several DUBs, particularly USP7 [312]. BAY 117082 has been shown to have anti-cancer effects on T-cell
lymphomas [313], B-cell lymphomas [314], colon cancer
cells [315] and HTLV-1 T-cell lines [316]. Cellular studies
using the more recently discovered NSC697923 are still
only preliminary, however anti-cancer properties against
neuroblastoma [309] and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
cells have been reported [307].

active conformation is observed in 17 of the other human
E2s suggesting that this conformation is important for
the catalytic activity of many E2s [27]. In Ubc13, part of
the trigger involved in the transition from the inactive to
active loop conformation likely involves Asn123, which
is only found in Ubc13 and no other E2 family members.
In the inactive loop conformation, Asn123 is buried within
Ubc13 and hydrogen bonds to the main chain carbonyl
oxygens of His77, Pro78, and Val80 (Figure 6A, 6B). In
the active conformation, Asn123 is rotated out to hydrogen
bond with the main chain amide of the incoming acceptor
ubiquitin Lys63, catalyzing the reorientation of the entire
loop (Figure 6C). Based on NMR measurements and
molecular dynamics simulations, we have suggested that
the Ubc13 active site loop is dynamic and that changes in
the loop conformation could serve as a catalytic gate [57].
Intriguingly, the structures of Ubc13 bound to a variety
of E3s or other regulatory factors such as OTUB1 and
OspI reveal a variety of active site loop conformations,
suggesting that the binding of these factors could influence
Ubc13 catalytic activity through effects on the active site
loop.
Insights from the Ubc13 loop orientation
observations suggest a way forward for rational Ubc13
inhibitor development. In the NSC697923-inhibited
Ubc13 structure (Figure 6D), Asn123 hydrogen bonds
to the 5-nitrofuran adduct, which packs into the pocket
formed by the active site loop and effectively locks
the loop in its inactive conformation. We suggest that
covalent attachment may not be necessary to selectively
inhibit Ubc13, as a compound that could non-covalently
bind the small Ubc13 pocket, while forming a hydrogen
bond to Asn123, might still trap the loop in its inactive
conformation to block Ubc13 catalytic activity.

Conclusions and perspective

for

In this review, we have attempted a global review
of studies of Ubc13 in various pathways and capacities.
We focused on studies that directly implicate Ubc13,
however we note that we have omitted studies that have
implicated a role for Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains in
particular cellular processes, but have not explicitly
demonstrated a role for Ubc13. As the sole known E2
capable of generating Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains,
Ubc13 represents a critical protein in many pathways in
many different cell types. The fact that Ubc13 is crucial
for inflammatory and DNA damage response pathways
involved in many different cancer types, makes it an
attractive target for therapeutic modulation. Additionally,
Ubc13 involvement in viral, bacterial, and parasitic
infections makes it an even more important enzyme in
human disease. Ubc13 possesses a number of desirable
traits as a target for inhibition. Its unique active site
architecture within the E2 family presents possibilities
for the development of Ubc13-specific inhibitors [27]. In

We suggest that Ubc13 initially exists in an inactive
ground state governed by the conformation of the active
site loop (residues 114-124). In structures of Ubc13 lacking
ubiquitin or an E3 partner, the active site loop adopts a
conformation that blocks access to the active site cysteine
through the positioning of Leu121 (Figure 6A, 6B).
This orientation of the active site loop is only observed
in Ubc13 and not in any other E2 analyzed to date. The
orientation is not merely a crystal packing artifact since
it is conserved in the structure of the S. cerevisiae Ubc13
ortholog [23]. This inactive loop conformation shifts to
allow the incoming Lys63 of an acceptor ubiquitin access
to the active site cysteine for the nucleophilic attack. This
is observed in the structure of Mms2/Ubc13~Ub (PDB:
2GMI [19]), in which a symmetry mate of the donor
ubiquitin binds Mms2 in a neighboring asymmetric unit,
providing a view of an acceptor ubiquitin with its Lys63
directed towards the Ubc13 active site (Figure 6C). This

screening approaches to maximize interactions with the
nearby ubiquitin tail binding groove, as well as the E2/
E3 surface. Such an approach could be used to develop
compounds that inhibit specific E2/E3 pairs without the
need for covalent reaction at the active site cysteine.
Compounds that are highly selective for a particular E2/
E3 pair could provide intriguing tools for the selective
modulation of specific signaling pathways. It is likely that
future studies will uncover still further Ubc13-dependent
signaling roles, as its Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains are
pervasive and seem to act as protein aggregation signals
at important sites that require the assembly of large protein
signaling complexes.

addition, a subset (17 E2s) of the ~34-40 active human
E2 enzymes share a great degree of similarity in overall
fold and residue conservation, therefore the discovery of
a unique active site loop conformation and small pocket
crucial to Ubc13 inhibition sets it apart from other E2s.
To date no synthetic lethal relationships have
been uncovered between Ubc13 and other genes in
humans. The principle of synthetic lethality is powerful,
and has been demonstrated through the application of
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition as
a means to treat BRCA-deficient cancers [194, 317].
The inhibition of PARP, involved in single-strand break
repair, results in DNA lesions that require HR for repair
and results in specificity for BRCA-deficient cancer cells
over normal cells. This is particularly important because
traditional chemotherapy targets highly proliferating (or
dividing) cells, which causes severe side-effects such
as a dangerously compromised immune system through
bone marrow destruction [318]. The other issue with
the traditional mode of targeting is that solid tumors are
thought to have a gradient of proliferation rates with
stagnant non-dividing cells at the core, and proliferating
cells on the outer surface. This is likely a result of a unique
tumor microenvironment characterized by hypoxia, and
decreased diffusion rates of nutrients and acidity [318].
Indeed, many modern therapies that target DNA damage
response proteins are currently being developed due to the
involvement of DDR factors and genome instability in
many cancers [319].
A potential Ubc13-dependent synthetic-lethal
relationship has been identified in yeast, which may be
present, but unidentified in humans. Rev3 is the catalytic
subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, which functions in
the error-prone TLS pathway (Figure 4B) [320, 321].
As previously discussed, Ubc13/Mms2 is important for
the error-free lesion bypass TS pathway. Broomfield et
al. [320] found that cells with mutated Mms2 (defective
TS pathway) rely on the error-prone TLS, which
requires Rev3 and that a double Mms2, Rev3 mutant
was exceptionally sensitive to DNA damage induced by
UV irradiation and alkylating methyl methanesulfonate
(MMS) treatment. It is likely that Ubc13 shares the same
relationship to Rev3 as Mms2, therefore the relationship
could likely be exploited in humans if cancers are
identified with mutant/defective Rev3. The Rev3-Mms2
relationship was not, however, observed in DT40 chicken
cells [322], so the putative relationship between Rev3 and
Ubc13/Mms2 in humans needs to be established.
We recently proposed an alternative method of
modulating the ubiquitin system in relation to Ubc13
[45]. In this method, E2/E3 pairs are targeted as a single
functional unit with inhibitor-protein interactions spread
across the E2 active site and ubiquitin binding surface.
Targeting strategies for the E2/E3 could start with covalent
inhibitors anchored to the E2 active site cysteine. These
starting compounds could be varied in HTS or rational
