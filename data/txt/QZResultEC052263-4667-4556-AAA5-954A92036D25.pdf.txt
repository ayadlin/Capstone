Abstract
Bone microenvironment and cell–cell interactions are crucial for the initiation and development of
metastasis. By means of a pharmacologic approach, using the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib,
we tested the relevance of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) axis in the bone marrow (BM)
stromal compartment for the initiation and development of lung cancer metastasis to bone. PDGFRb was found
to be the main tyrosine kinase target of sunitinib expressed in BM stromal ST-2 and MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic
cells. In contrast, no expression of sunitinib-targeted receptors was found in A549M1 and low levels in H460M5
lung cancer metastatic cells. Incubation of ST-2 and human BM endothelial cells with sunitinib led to potent cell
growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, sunitinib induced a robust
proapoptotic effect in vivo on BM stromal PDGFRbþ cells and produced extensive disruption of tissue
architecture and vessel leakage in the BM cavity. Pretreatment of ST-2 cells with sunitinib also hindered
heterotypic adhesion to lung cancer cell lines. These effects were correlated with changes in cell–cell and cell–
matrix molecules in both stromal and tumor cells. Pretreatment of mice with sunitinib before intracardiac
inoculation of A549M1 or H460M5 cells caused marked inhibition of tumor cells homing to bone, whereas no
effect was found when tumor cells were pretreated before inoculation. Treatment with sunitinib dramatically
increased overall survival and prevented tumor colonization but not bone lesions, whereas combination with
zoledronic acid resulted in marked reduction of osteolytic lesions and osseous tumor burden. Thus, disruption of
the PDGFR axis in the BM stroma alters heterotypic tumor–stromal and tumor–matrix interactions, thereby
preventing efficient engagement required for bone homing and osseous colonization. These results support the
notion that concomitant targeting of the tumor and stromal compartment is a more effective approach for
blocking bone metastasis. Cancer Res; 71(1); 164–74. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Metastasis is a multistep process that is characterized by
invasion of tumor cells into neighboring tissues, intravasation,
survival in circulation, infiltration, and colonization of target
organs (1, 2). Bone is a frequent target of dissemination of cells
derived from solid tumors, including those of the breast,
prostate, kidney, thyroid, and lung (3).

In primary tumors, nontumor cells, such as fibroblasts,
immune cells, and endothelial cells (EC), and a variety of
bone marrow (BM)–derived cells can induce tumor progression as a response to tumor-mediated signaling (4). A similar
paradigm to that which occurs in the primary tumor could
also influence metastatic development in a target organ. The
long-standing "seed–soil" hypothesis has established the
requirement for adaptive compatibility between tumor cells
and the host organ (2–5). During early steps of bone metastatic homing, tumor cells infiltrate the osseous fenestrated
capillary bed. This offers little mechanical constraint to tumor
cells that engage with the host microenvironment, which is
mainly formed by ECs of the microvasculature, and the
stromal components of the osseous compartment (6). Subsequently, colonization frequently entails the formation of
tumor-induced osteolytic lesions and progressive infiltration
of malignant cells in the BM compartment. This process is
mediated by induction of a subset of genes that endow cells
with advantageous functions that lead to increased osteoclastogenic effects. Paracrine loops between bone–matrix-derived
factors such as transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) and
tumor cells have been shown to increase bone colonization
(7–11). In addition, deleterious proteolytic degradation at the

Mechanism for Tumor Cells “Homing” to Bone

tumor–stroma interface also contributes to bone destruction
(11). During this process, tumor–stroma or tumor–endothelium interactions can exacerbate both mechanisms of bone–
matrix degradation.
In tumor cells, several genetic determinants have been
described that enhance the propensity to form efficient
metastasis in certain organs (12). For instance, CD44, which
binds bone collagen and osteopontin, participates in the
engagement of tumor cells in the bone microenvironment
(13). Similarly, CXCR4 favors chemotaxis toward a cytokine
that is highly expressed in bone stroma, SDF-1/CXCL12 (14).
In contrast, the requirements imposed by the host environment for the permissive maintenance and promotion of
secondary outgrowth are beginning to be understood for some
tumors (15). Crucial signaling pathways in stroma and or
endothelium might be required not only for proper cell–cell
engagement but also for the release of cytokines or growth
factors (16).
Sunitinib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase receptor with
known efficacy in a variety of tumors such as gastrointestinal
stromal tumor and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (17). Sunitinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial
growth receptor 1–3 (VEGFR 1–3), platelet-derived growth
factor receptor a and b (PDGFRa and b), c-kit, colonystimulating factor 1 R (CSF-1R), and FLT3 (17). Currently,
sunitinib is under intensive investigation in a variety of other
cancers including breast, colorectal, and non–small cell lung
cancer (18). The major targets VEGFR-1 to -3 are largely
expressed in ECs; therefore, sunitinib elicits a potent antiangiogenic effect and might influence BM homeostasis (19–21).
PDGFR has been shown to be crucial for pericyte maintenance
and its inhibition synergizes with VEGFR blockade to impair
tumor growth (22). Furthermore, the PDGFR axis has been
shown to be frequently deregulated in a variety of tumors.
Given the relevance of this pathway in stromal and endothelial components of the bone compartment, we hypothesized
that altering this axis could derange early steps of tumor
metastatic homing and colonization. In this study, using
sunitinib in a model of bone metastasis from lung cancer,
we showed profound effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis in endothelial and stromal cells both in vitro and in vivo,
which led to impaired tumor homing. In addition, sunitinib
induced a dramatic delay in bone colonization by tumor cells
and prolongation of lifespan. Thus, our findings underscore
the validity of targeting the bone microenvironment to
increase therapeutic benefits.

P53. A549M1 and H460M5 cells represent subpopulations of
cells isolated from long bone after intracardiac (i.c.) inoculation in athymic nude mice (data not shown).
Adhesion assays
Adhesion experiments were performed as described (23).
Substrates used were fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, collagen
type I, and gelatin, and plastic and bovine serum albumin were
used as controls.
For cell–cell monolayer assays, ST-2 cells or HBMECs were
seeded at confluence in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later,
105 luciferase labeled cells/well were seeded onto the monolayers and allowed to drop and adhere for 1 hour. Luminescence was counted using Optimat Luminometer (Berthold
Laboratories). Experiments were repeated 3 times.
In vivo treatments
Sunitinib was purchased from LC Laboratories and zoledronic acid from Novartis. Four-week-old athymic nude mice
(Harlan) were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Animals were treated with 60 mg/kg/d of sunitinib (by
oral gavage) and 3 mg/kg/d of zoledronic acid. Inoculation
was performed as previously described (24). All procedures
were conducted following the guidelines of our Animal Care
and Use Committee (University of Navarra, Spain).
Statistical analysis
Log-rank test was used to compare differences in metastasis survival curves. Data were analyzed by the Kruskal–
Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test. Values were
expressed as means  SEM and statistical significance was
defined as P < 0.05 (*), P < 0.01 (**), and P < 0.001 (***), as
shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 6.

Results
Expression of functional tyrosine kinase receptors
We chose A549M1 and H460M5 lung subpopulations that
were previously selected by in vivo passage, using previously
published protocol (25), and isolated for their propensity to form
bone metastatic lesions (data not shown). We also used murine
BM stromal cells (ST-2), murine preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells,
and HBMECs as representative models of BM stromal and
endothelial compartments. Expression levels of different tyrosine receptors targeted by multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib were investigated by real-time PCR.
As shown in Fig. 1A, ST-2 and MC3T3-E1 cells expressed
high levels of PDGFRb and PDGFRa, whereas HUVECs and
HBMECs (not shown) expressed high levels of VEGFR-1 and
VEGFR-2 and residual levels of c-kit. In contrast, receptor
levels in A549M1 and H460M5 cells were almost undetectable
by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for all the receptors tested.
Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the presence of
PDGFRb in the membrane of ST-2 cells, with the concomitant
detection of the stromal marker fibroblast-specific protein 1
(FSP-1; Fig. 1B).

Figure 1. Expression and effects of sunitinib on stromal, endothelial, and lung cancer cells in vitro. A, expression levels of sunitinib-targeted receptors
measured by real-time qPCR in lung cancer cells (A549, H460, H727), stromal ST-2, preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, and HBEMC cells. B, PDGFRb
expression was assessed by immunofluorescence in ST-2 cells. FSP-1 was used as a mesenchymal marker. C, Western blot analysis of PDGFRb
phosphorylation and total PDGFRb upon PDGF-A treatment for 5 or 10 minutes in ST-2 cells, A549M1 cells, and HBEMCs. PDGFRb phosphorylation was
strongly inhibited by sunitinib (1 mmol/L) in ST-2 cells, whereas HBMECs and A549M1 cells did not express this receptor. D, MTT proliferation assays
performed at 72 hours showed high sensitivity of HBMECs and ST-2 BM stromal cells to sunitinib. Proliferation of lung cancer cells was not affected by this
drug. E, sunitinib induced apoptosis in ST-2 cells, as shown by the increase in active caspase-3 measured by flow cytometry.

To substantiate this finding and to validate the efficiency of
sunitinib, we assessed inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptor
levels by Western blot analysis. ST-2 cells expressed PDGFRb,
and the administration of the natural ligand PDGF-A at a dose
of 10 ng/mL for 5 or 10 minutes resulted in strong phosphorylation of the receptor. Incubation with sunitinib led to the
inhibition of PDGFRb phosphorylation in these cells (Fig. 1C).
Similar results were obtained with MC3T3-E1 cells (data not
shown). In contrast, and in agreement with previous findings,
no receptors were detected in HBMECs, A549M1 (Fig. 1C), or
H460M5 cells (not shown). Similarly, sunitinib effectively
blocked the activation of VEGFR-2 in HBMECs (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These data indicate that PDGFRb is the main target in ST-2
and MC3T-E1 cells whereas VEGFR-2 is the main tyrosine
kinase receptor blocked by sunitinib in HBMECs.

Effects of sunitinib on cell proliferation and apoptosis
Next, we tested the effects of sunitinib on cell proliferation
by MTT assays. Incubation of ST-2 cells or HBMECs with
sunitinib led to decreased cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). In contrast, growth rate of A549M1,
H460M5, or H727 cells was unaffected (Fig. 1D). These data are
consistent with the presence of sunitinib-targeted receptors in
ST-2 cells and HBEMCs.
We also studied the effect of sunitinib on apoptosis. Incubation of ST-2 cells with sunitinib led to increased activity of
caspase-3, by flow cytometric analysis, in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1E). In contrast, no effect was observed in
A549M1 and H460M5 cells treated under identical conditions
(data not shown). Thus, blockade of the PDGFR/VEGFR axis
by sunitinib decreases proliferation and enhances apoptosis in
ST-2 cells and HBMECs.

Figure 2. Sunitinib blocks crucial tumor–stroma interactions in vitro. A, adhesion of A549M1 cells to collagen I (Col I), fibronectin (FN), vitronectin (VN),
hyaluronic acid (HA), type II gelatin, and BSA after sunitinib treatment. Sunitinib diminished the adhesion of tumor cells to Col I (P < 0.05), whereas adhesion to
fibronectin was enhanced upon sunitinib treatment (P < 0.01). Adhesion to other substrates was not affected upon treatment. B, adhesion of A549M1
and H460M5 cells to monolayers of ST-2 cells was tested under different experimental conditions. Adhesion of A549M1 and H460M5 cells was modified only
when ST-2 cells were pretreated for 12 hours with sunitinib (200 nmol/L). C, levels of activity of MMP3/10 (measured by a fluorogenic substrate) in supernatants
of ST-2 and A549M1 cells were decreased by sunitinib (P < 0.05), whereas those of HUVEC and H460M5 cells were unaltered. D, increasing doses of sunitinib
decreased osteoclast differentiation assessed by quantification of the area of TRAPþ cells. The experiment was repeated 3 times with similar results.

Effects of sunitinib on cell–matrix adhesion
To study the effects of sunitinib on cell–matrix adhesion,
we pretreated A549M1 cells with sunitinib at a dose of
20–200 nmol/L and cultured the cells on different substrates
for 6 hours. Sunitinib significantly inhibited the ability of these
cells to adhere to collagen type I, the most abundant bone
matrix protein, whereas adhesion to fibronectin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) component that is highly abundant in lung
parenchyma (26), was increased (Fig. 2A). In contrast, sunitinib had no effect on cell adhesion to other matrix proteins.
Slight differences were found when the same experiment was
performed with H460M5 cells, indicating that changes in cell
adhesion in these cells are cell line specific (Supplementary
Fig. S2A).
Effect of sunitinib on cell–cell adhesion
To study the adhesive ability of A549M1 and H460M5 cells
to monolayers of ST-2 cells and HBMECs, we pretreated these
acceptor cells with sunitinib for 12 hours at a dose of 200
nmol/L. A reduction in the ability of A549M1 and H460M5
cells to adhere to ST-2 cells was found when ST-2 cells were
pretreated with sunitinib (P < 0.05). In contrast, no effect was
seen when the drug and the cells were added simultaneously
(Fig. 2B). No changes in adhesion were detected when A549M1
or H460M5 cells were cocultured with HBMECs (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These results indicate that sunitinib alters

www.aacrjournals.org

crucial cell–cell adhesion components in ST-2 stromal cells,
which could be required for tumor–cell engagement.
Effects of sunitinib in migration and invasiveness
Sunitinib altered cell–matrix adhesion in A549M1 cells; therefore, we investigated whether these changes had functional
effects in cell invasion and migration. No effect was found in
the migration of A549M1 or H460M5 cells when they were
incubated with sunitinib (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Similarly,
invasive ability through Matrigel was unaltered in A549M1 or
H460M5 cells upon incubation with physiologic doses of sunitinib. However, invasiveness was impaired at high doses (1
mmol/L) in both cell lines, although it did not reach statistical
significance in H460M5 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). These
findings indicate that sunitinib at therapeutic doses did not
affect migration and invasiveness of lung cancer cells.
Next, we explored whether sunitinib could modify extracellular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. To explore
this possibility, global MMP activity was assessed by a kinetic
fluorescence assay. A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the
MMP3/10 activity in the supernatants of A549M1 cells was
found when they were treated with 20 or 200 nmol/L of
sunitinib (Fig. 2C). In ST-2 stromal cells, only a high dose
(which causes cytotoxicity in these cells) resulted in significant reduction of MMP3/10 activity, whereas no changes were
found for ECs (HUVEC) or H460M5 cells (Fig. 2C). MMP2/9

activity was below the level of detection in all the cells tested.
These results indicate that sunitinib impairs extracellular
MMP activity shown by A549M1 cells.
To examine the effect of sunitinib in osteoclastogenesis,
different doses of the drug were incubated with conditioned
media from A549M1 cells and added to mouse BM macrophages in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand
(RANKL). Sunitinib led to a marked decrease in osteoclast
differentiation at high doses (200 nmol/L and 1 mmol/L; P <
0.001), whereas low doses significantly affect osteoclast formation to a lower extent (Fig. 2D). Similar results were
obtained when the experiment was repeated with H460M5
cells (data not shown). These data indicate that sunitinib
impairs osteoclast differentiation.
Transcriptomic effects of sunitinib on ST-2 and A549M1
cells
We used PCR multiplex analysis to study the effects of
sunitinib on cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion molecules in
ST-2 and A549M1 cells. We quantified a total of 84 transcripts
related to adhesion/invasion.
In ST-2 cells, at least a 2-fold expression change was found in
29 genes (5 upregulated and 24 downregulated). For A549M1
cells, a total of 36 genes were found to be at least 2-fold
deregulated. Five of them were upregulated with both doses
used, 21 were downregulated, and 10 genes displayed inconsistent behavior depending on the dose administered (Fig. 3).
Furthermore, as shown in Table 1, analysis revealed upregulation of epithelial markers in both cell lines, such as
CTNNA1 and CTNNB1, ITGB1, and collagens COLA5A1 and
COL6A1. Downregulated genes in both cell lines included
mesenchyme-related molecules such as TNC, fibronectin,
and integrins ITGA4 and ITGA8. CD44, a known marker of
mesenchymal phenotype, was decreased in A549M1 cells after
treatment with sunitinib, whereas E-cadherin (CDH1) was
markedly increased. Hence, sunitinib alters the pattern of
adhesion/invasion molecules in stromal and tumor cells.
Effects of sunitinib on BM in vivo
To study the effects of sunitinib in vivo, we treated mice
with 60 mg/kg of sunitinib for 24 and 72 hours. After 24-hour
treatment, small areas of hemorrhage in the long bones were
observed at this time, even macroscopically. Seventy-two
hours posttreatment (Fig. 4A–C), histologic analysis revealed
disruption of the BM architecture, with extensive areas of
hemorrhage (Fig. 4C). Numerous star-shaped cells undergoing

Figure 3. Transcriptomic analysis by real-time qPCR of cancer-related
adhesion and ECM genes in sunitinib-treated ST-2 and A549M1 cells. ST-2
and A549M1 cells were treated with 20 and 200 nmol/L of sunitinib for 24
hours. Real-time qPCR was performed using a commercial panel of
primers for adhesion and ECM molecules. Heat maps represent the fold
change of those genes that were found to be altered. Results for ST-2 cells
treated with 200 nmol/L of sunitinib were omitted because of high levels of
apoptosis observed with this dose. As shown in Table 1, upregulated
genes included epithelial markers (CDH1, CTNNA1, and CTNNB1) and
downregulated genes included previously described mesenchyme-related
molecules (CD44, TNC, and FN).

Figure 4. Sunitinib induces a rapid apoptotic response in BM stromal cells in vivo, resulting in BM disruption. A–C, photomicrographs of hematoxylin and eosin
(H/E)-stained femoral sections from mice untreated (A) and treated for 24 hours (B) and 72 hours (C) with a dose of 60 mg/kg. After 24 to 72 hours, scattered

apoptosis in the BM (Fig. 4E, and inset) were detected by
active caspase-3 staining. In contrast, at 72 hours, fewer
apoptotic cells were detected by active caspase-3 staining
than the number observed at 24 hours. Coimmunofluorescence revealed that most of the apoptotic cells coexpressed
PDGFRb (Fig. 4G–I), which suggested that most of these cells
belonged to the BM stromal compartment. Of note, bones of
mice treated daily for 3 weeks did not display visible abnormalities in the BM, or apoptotic cells or hemorrhagic appearance, which suggested that sunitinib had a transient effect on
the BM (Supplementary Fig. S2E). These data indicate that
sunitinib induces apoptosis in BM PDGFRbþ cells for a
transient period, which leads to derangement of the bone
microenvironment.
Sunitinib alters tumor homing to bone
Sunitinib alters BM components in vitro and in vivo; therefore, we sought to investigate the impact of these findings in
tumor cells homing to bone. Mice were treated with sunitinib
3 days before i.c. inoculation of tumor cells at 60 mg/kg/d
(Fig. 5A). Highly metastatic A549M1 cells were retrovirally
transduced with a luciferase reporter gene for in vivo image
analysis (27). Bioluminescence image analysis revealed a significant lower intensity in the hind limbs of the sunitinibtreated mice than vehicle-treated controls (P < 0.030; Fig. 5B).

Cancer Res; 71(1) January 1, 2011

At that time point, animals were sacrificed and cells in the
hind limbs were isolated by BM flushing. Conspicuous single
cell–derived colonies (SCC) that were derived from each
animal were counted. Consistent with previous findings, the
number of SCCs derived from sunitinib-treated animals was
significantly lower than that in the controls (P < 0.021; Fig. 5C).
Similar results were obtained with another highly metastatic
lung cancer cell line: H460M5 (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).
These data indicate that sunitinib alters tumor homing to
bone, presumably by altering the bone microenvironment.
However, to discriminate the fact that sunitinib could also
affect circulating tumor cells before efficient homing to
the bone compartment, we incubated in vitro for 2 days
A549M1 cells with vehicle or 200 nmol/L of sunitinib, a dose
similar to the levels reached in plasma after administration of
60 mg/kg/d of sunitinib (Fig. 5D). Animals were sacrificed
4 days postinoculation. Bioluminescence image analysis
revealed no differences between groups (Fig. 5E). Similarly,
isolation of SCCs derived from both groups of animals
revealed no differences (Fig. 5F). Similar results were obtained
with H460M5 cell line (Supplementary Fig. S3C and D). These
findings suggest that incubation of tumor cells with sunitinib
in vitro before in vivo inoculation did not affect tumor cells in
their ability to efficiently infiltrate and survive in the bone
compartment.

Sunitinib effect on bone metastatic activity
Our previous findings suggested that sunitinib alters the BM
microenvironment and tumor cell invasive ability. Thus, we
tested the extent to which sunitinib could prevent prometastatic activity of lung cancer cells to bone, alone or in combination with ZA, a drug currently used in patients to treat bone
metastasis. Highly metastatic A549M1 cells were inoculated i.c.
and treated daily with sunitinib alone or in combination with
ZA, starting 6 days postinoculation, according to the therapeutic regimen (Fig. 6A). As expected, ZA-treated animals
showed a slight increase in overall survival as compared with
control mice. Combined drug treatment led to a significant
increase in overall survival in animals treated with sunitinib
alone or in combination with ZA (Fig. 6B). These findings were
correlated with a significant decrease in bone colonization as
assessed by bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 6C and D). ZA
treatment, alone or in combination with sunitinib, markedly
reduced bone metastatic lesions as assessed by X-ray image
analysis and micro-CT (Fig. 6E and F). However, despite the
decrease in tumor burden observed by bioluminescence, animals treated with sunitinib alone showed prominent bone
osteolytic lesions, similar in extent to those in vehicle-treated
animals observed by X-ray imaging. These findings were correlated with a decrease in the number of tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells, which were counted at the
tumor–bone interface in animals treated with ZA alone or in
combination with sunitinib (Fig. 6G). Sunitinib-treated animals showed a similar lifespan as the ZA/sunitinib-treated
animals, despite the presence of prominent bone lesions, which
suggested that other effects related to tumor-induced cachexia
might have been prevented by sunitinib. Consistently, the

www.aacrjournals.org

number of TRAPþ cells at the tumor–bone interface in sunitinib-treated animals was similar to that in the vehicle-treated
control mice. Taken together, these data indicate that the
combination of sunitinib and ZA increases animal survival
and prevents the development of osteolytic lesions.

Discussion
Compatibility between organ microenvironment and tumor
cells is required for proper metastatic colonization (2–5).
Although mechanical constraints imposed by the microvascular
bed certainly influence cell arrest, in previous studies in a model
of lung metastasis to bone, the uniform location of osseous
lesions in the metaphysis of long bones suggested that rather
than occurring as a result of stochastic events, specific tumor–
endothelium/stroma engagement can take place (11). In the
present study, we have explored this observation by investigating the contribution of the PDGFR pathway in the microenvironment in early steps of bone homing. We found that perturbed
microenvironment caused by sunitinib-induced apoptosis of
PDGFRbþ cells resulted in deranged tumor homing, which led
to increased animal survival in a lung cancer metastasis model.
Thus, our approach unveiled the relevance of the stromal and
endothelial bone environment in early events of homing during
tumor cell engagement. Several findings support this contention. First, the PDGFR pathway is required for normal homeostasis, because pharmacologic blockade decreased BM stromal
cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in vitro. Second,
apoptosis was also observed in PDGFRþ cells in vivo. Third,
lung cancer cells homing to bone was markedly diminished in
pretreated animals. Thus, the PDGFR pathway in the bone

Figure 6. Inhibition of lung cancer bone metastatic colonization by sunitinib. A, experimental outline. Mice were treated daily, starting 6 days after i.c.
tumor cell inoculation, with sunitinib (60 mg/kg/d), ZA (at 3 mg/kg/d), or a combination of both. B, Kaplan–Meier curves of survival of mice injected with A549M1
cells. Sunitinib, either alone or in combination with ZA, doubled the lifespan of mice (P < 0.001). ZA alone did not improve survival. C and D, photon flux images
in the metaphyses of tumor-bearing mice. All treatments decreased tumor burden in the metaphyses of A549 M1-injected mice. The effect was more
potent in the case of combined treatment. E, bones were analyzed by X-ray (a–d), micro-computed tomography (e–h), and TRAP (j–m) histochemistry. F, X-ray
image analysis of osteolytic lesions in long bones. Treatment of mice with sunitinib and ZA or ZA alone reduced significantly the bone metastatic area as
compared with control mice. Sunitinib did not prevent the development of osteolytic lesions. Bones from vehicle and sunitinib-treated mice showed extensive
bone destruction in the metaphyses (a, e and c, g), whereas ZA alone or in combination with sunitinib prevented osteolytic lesions (b, f and d, h). G. TRAPþ
multinucleated cells were counted at tumor bone interphase. Bone destruction was observed in sunitinib and vehicle-treated mice, which correlated with the
number of TRAPþ cells (l and j), whereas ZA, alone or in combination with sunitinib, prevented bone destruction and decreased the number of TRAPþ
cells (k and m).

Mechanism for Tumor Cells “Homing” to Bone

microenvironment is crucial for early events in bone metastasis.
These findings are in agreement with previous studies that have
shown that the antitumor effects of sunitinib are related to the
microenvironment rather than a direct effect on tumor cells
(28). Similarly, PDGFRa signaling necessary for the recruitment
of VEGFR-producing stromal fibroblasts is required for tumor
growth and angiogenesis (29, 30).
Other pathways targeted by sunitinib might also be involved
in the observed phenotype, including VEGFR, c-kit, or VEGFR3. In fact, the antiangiogenic effect of sunitinib that is
mediated through VEGF pathway blockade has already been
demonstrated (17). However, we provide here evidence that
the PDGFR axis is highly relevant in tumor–BM stroma
interactions. We showed that BM-derived stromal cells (with
high expression of PDGFR) were by far more sensitive to
sunitinib than BM-derived endothelial and tumor cells.
Plasma concentration of sunitinib in mice after administration of 60 mg/kg has been shown to be approximately 100 to
200 nmol/L (31), a dose that severely affects stromal cells but
not endothelial or tumor cells.
Rather than an effect on tumor cells, profound changes
induced by sunitinib in the BM compartment were most likely
impairing tumor-bone homing. In this regard, a large number
of adhesion molecules were also deregulated in ST-2 cells. All
these changes may promote the decrease in adhesion of
A549M1 cells to the bone substrate or BM resident cells in
early steps.
In the same line, mononuclear precursors were also targeted by sunitinib, leading to impaired osteoclastic differentiation in vitro. In a model of lung cancer metastasis, previous
findings have suggested the requirement of osteoclastic activity in early steps of osseous colonization whereas in late stages
tumor-derived proteolytic activity may prevail (11). Indeed,
other studies have shown a reduction of bone metastasis by
blocking CFS-1R phosphorylation and osteoclast formation in
a mouse model of breast cancer upon sunitinib treatment (32).
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in sunitinib-treated
animals, tumor-induced osteolytic lesions could be delayed in
vivo by impaired osteoclastogenesis, leading to decrease
tumor burden and marked delay in osseous colonization.
Even though tumor cell growth was unaffected in vitro, we
found that sunitinib also altered cell adhesion and invasion of
tumor cells. Slight differences in cell–matrix adhesion suggest
that subtle effects of sunitinib on tumor cells were cell line
specific. These changes could be mediated by partial inhibition
of other kinases and were consistent with the different expression of sunitinib-targeted receptors between A549 and H460
cells. In this line, inhibition of PDGFR/VEGFR-3 or other kinases
that present some residual expression in A549M1 cells could be
involved in the modulation of relevant matrix adhesion molecules such as integrins, collagen, laminin, TNC, and CD44.
Other in vitro effects such as cell invasiveness and osteoclast
activity were consistent between both cell lines. Besides slight
differences between tumor cell lines, these changes translate
in similar biological effects, as our in vivo findings suggest that
tumor cell homing to bone was unaffected when the cells were
pretreated before injection at a dosage that caused significant
transcriptomic modifications in these cell markers.

www.aacrjournals.org

Concomitant effects on the microenvironment and tumor
cells support the validity of a combinatorial therapeutic
approach that targets the stroma. Indeed, bisphosphonates,
such as ZA, currently used for the treatment of osteolytic
lesions, alter bone-mineralized matrix, thus impairing proper
osteoclast attachment required for bone resorption (33).
Similarly, the targeting of the stromal/endothelial compartment by sunitinib decreased tumor burden and increased
overall survival. Thus, combination of both drugs underscores
a new paradigm for the design of novel therapeutic modalities
and raises the intriguing possibility of using a similar
approach for the maintenance of bone mass in other types
of tumors. Besides the impaired tumor homing observed upon
sunitinib treatment, the most striking effect of combination of
both drugs was the increased lifespan observed in sunitinibtreated animals despite the presence of prominent osteolytic
lesions. We speculate that these preventive effects of sunitinib
might be related to the blockade of tumor-induced cachexia.
Despite the beneficial effects observed in our model, concerns about the use of sunitinib in vivo have been raised by
several recent findings (34, 35). In agreement with the effects
of other antiangiogenic therapies, altered BM architecture and
vasculature integrity in the BM also require a cautious use of
sunitinib in metastasis. This alteration is transient because
after continuous administration of the drug (up to 1 month),
the appearance of the BM was normal, which suggests that
alternative, compensatory pathways might be activated to
restore BM homeostasis. However, sunitinib most likely contributes to the release of BM-derived cells into the circulation,
as a consequence of BM disruption. Some of these cells, such
as VEGFR1þ cells, could disseminate to distant organs and
secrete chemoattractants that favor the development of a
prometastatic niche (36), which, in turn, could lead to the
recruitment of tumor cells. Although this speculation requires
further experimental validation, recent findings have
described enhanced metastasis to the lungs after short-term
treatment with bevacizumab and sunitinib (34, 35). However,
it has been well documented in many types of tumors (both in
animal models and in patients) that sustained administration
of sunitinib results in potent reduction of tumor growth with
minimal toxicity (37). Our findings strongly support the
therapeutic benefit of sunitinib in inhibiting tumor burden
and bone metastasis.
In summary, our results unveiled the requirement of
an intact PDGFR signaling pathway for BM homeostasis
and effective engagement of the tumor–bone microenvironment. Host-related effects are likely responsible for the
significant impairment in bone homing, bone metastatic
colonization, and the dramatic decrease in tumor burden,
which significantly extended overall survival. Moreover, this
novel mechanism of action offers a new window of opportunity for combination therapy that targets tumor and the
stromal microenvironment for effective treatment of bone
metastasis.
