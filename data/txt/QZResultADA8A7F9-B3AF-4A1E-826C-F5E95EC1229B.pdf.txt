Abstract
Tumors initiate angiogenesis primarily by secreting vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A164). The first new vessels
to form are greatly enlarged, pericyte-poor sinusoids, called
mother vessels (MV), that originate from preexisting venules.
We postulated that the venular enlargement necessary to form
MV would require a selective degradation of their basement
membranes, rigid structures that resist vascular expansion. To
identify the specific proteases responsible for MV formation,
we induced angiogenesis in mouse tissues with an adenoviral
vector expressing VEGF-A164 (Ad-VEGF-A164) or with VEGF-A–
secreting TA3/St mammary tumors. We found that MV
formation resulted from greatly increased activity of cathepsins (B>S>L) in venules transitioning into MV, as well as from
a reciprocal decrease in the expression of several cysteine
protease inhibitors (CPI), stefin A and cystatins B and C, by
these same venules. Using a fluorescence probe that selectively
binds cellular sites of cathepsin protease activity in vivo, we
showed that increased cathepsin activity was localized
exclusively to perivenular cells, not to venule endothelial
cells. CPI strikingly inhibited angiogenesis in the Matrigel
assay, and Ad-VEGF-A164–induced angiogenesis was reduced
by f50% in cathepsin B–null mice. Thus, VEGF-A, whether
expressed by interstitial cells infected with an adenoviral
vector or by tumor cells, upsets the normal cathepsin-CPI
balance in nearby venules, leading to degradation of their
basement membranes, an important first step in angiogenesis.

Introduction
To grow beyond minimal size, tumors must induce a new
vascular supply (1). They do so by overexpressing growth factors,
particularly vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF-A) and its 164 (mouse)/165 (human) isoform
(2–4). However, unlike the angiogenesis of normal development,
the new blood vessels that tumors induce are highly abnormal and
differ strikingly from the microvessels of normal tissues with
respect to both structure and function (2, 3, 5). The first new vessels

to form in many transplantable mouse tumor models are mother
vessels (MV), a blood vessel type that is also common in many
autochthonous human tumors (2, 3, 6–8). MV are greatly enlarged,
thin-walled, hyperpermeable, pericyte-depleted sinusoids that form
from preexisting venules. The dramatic enlargement of venules
leading to MV formation would seem to require proteolytic
degradation of their basement membranes. Vascular basement
membranes are primarily composed of laminins and type IV
collagen (9–11). They are rigid, noncompliant (nonelastic) structures and allow only an increase of f30% in cross-sectional area in
response to increased internal pressure (12); by contrast, MV
commonly have cross-sectional areas that are 4 to 5 times those of
the venules from which they arise (2, 3, 7, 8).
The specific proteases responsible for generating MV have not
been identified. Tumors are complex entities in which many
different proteases participate in a wide range of simultaneous
processes that include tumor, stromal, inflammatory and vascular
cell proliferation, and migration. Several different classes of
proteases have been identified in tumors including matrix metalloproteases (MMP) and serine and cysteine proteases (13–16). Of
these, MMPs have received the most attention (15, 17, 18).
However, in recent years, cysteine proteases, and particularly
cathepsins B, L, S and H, have been implicated in tumor cell
invasion, metastasis and, more recently, in tumor angiogenesis
(13, 19–26). Cathepsins are members of the papain subfamily of
cysteine proteases (13); they are found in lysosomes and have
traditionally been associated with intracellular functions (27, 28).
More recent data indicate that cathepsins are secreted, can
function extracellularly to degrade matrix proteins, and have
significant roles in tumor angiogenesis (13, 20–24, 29).
Endogenous inhibitors of cathepsins, members of the cysteine
protease inhibitor (CPI) family, have also been implicated in tumor
progression. CPI are small, 11- to 13-kDa proteins that include
stefin A and cystatins B and C (27). RIP-Tag 2 tumors grow faster in
cystatin C null than in wild-type mice (30), and changes in CPI have
been reported in several different tumors (31–35).
The goal of the present investigation was to identify the specific
proteases and protease inhibitors that participate in MV formation,
as well as the cell types that make them. To avoid the complexities
of the tumor environment, in which many cell types, proteases, and
protease inhibitors participate, we made use of an adenoviral
vector that expresses VEGF-A164 (Ad-VEGF-A164); when injected
into mouse tissues, Ad-VEGF-A164 induces an angiogenic response
that closely mimics that induced by malignant tumors (2, 3, 7, 36).
We report here that increased expression of several cathepsins

normal control (ctl. ) mice and from mice whose ears had been injected 3 d earlier with Ad-VEGF-A164. Immediately before sacrifice, mice were injected i.v. with

7 and 10, there is increased expression of intact laminin h1 chain (arrow ), as well as high molecular weight fragments. D, glomeruloid microvascular proliferations

(B>S>L), accompanied by a reciprocal decrease in the expression of
their inhibitors, members of the CPI family, is responsible for the
vascular basement membrane degradation that allows MV to form.
Furthermore, increased cathepsin and reduced CPI expression was
localized selectively to venules that were transitioning into MV. We
substantiated these results with a VEGF-A–expressing tumor.
Together, these findings implicate venule-associated cathepsins
and their CPI inhibitors in the earliest stage of tumor angiogenesis.
Subsequently, this degradative process was reversed as MV evolved
into daughter vessels, a process accompanied by extensive new
vascular basement membrane synthesis.

Materials and Methods
Animals, adenoviral vectors, and tumors. Ad-VEGF-A164 and Ad-LacZ
and their injection into athymic nude mice (National Cancer Institute) were
described previously (7). A/J mice (Jackson Laboratory) and the TA3/St
tumor were described previously (37). Cathepsin B–null mice on the FVB
background were generously provided by Dr. Thomas Reinheckel, Institut
für Molekulare Medizin und Zellforschung, Freiburg, Germany (38). All
studies were performed under protocols approved by the Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Microvascular density was calculated by counting 6 highly vascularized
fields in each section at 400. To quantify the angiogenic response, 100 AL
0.5% Evans Blue dye were injected i.v. and mice were sacrificed 5 min later
(8). Flank tissue images were photographed and calibrated at a standard
magnification. The intensity of bluing was calculated with the IP laboratory
program (Scanalytics), using automated segmentation of bluing intensity
with a fixed threshold limit.
Histology, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. Ears
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and 5-Am sections were immunostained (7) with antibodies specific for pan-laminins (Novus biologicals), type
IV collagen (Cosmo Bio Co. LTD), stefin A (Chemicon), cystatins B and C

(R&D Systems), cathepsin B (Neuromics), or CD31 (BD Biosciences). Images
were obtained from two to five different ears or tumors at each time point.
For confocal microscopy, mice were injected i.v. with FITC-lectin (Vector
Laboratories). After perfusion, ears were removed, split into dorsal and
ventral halves, exposed to primary antibodies, and incubated with Texas
red–conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Invitrogen). Images were
obtained from three or more ears at each time point. For imaging cathepsin
B/S/L activity, 25 nmol of GB123 was injected i.v. 8 h later, FITC-Lectin was
injected i.v., mice were sacrificed, and tissues were visualized in a LSM 510
Meta confocal microscope (39).
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis. Ear sites were rapidly
frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground with a mortar and pestle, and lysed on ice
in 1 AL sample buffer/mg ear tissue: 62.5 Amol/L Tris, 250 mmol/L HEPES,
0.5% NP40, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 5% sucrose, and 0.005%
bromophenol blue. Immunoblotting was performed with a specific antibody
against laminin h1 chain (CHEMICON). Experiments were repeated four
times.
Isolation of RNA, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA
was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit and reverse transcribed using
TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems). PCR primers
were prepared as displayed on the PrimerBank Web site6 (40), as follows:
cystatin B (6681071a1), cystatin C (31981822a1), cathepsin B (6681079a2),
cathepsin L (6753558a3), cathepsin H (7106279a3), and cathepsin D
(18043133a1). PCR primers for cyclophilin were forward 5¶-CAGACGCCACTGTCGCTTT-3¶ and reverse 5¶-TGTCTTTGGAACTTTGTCTGCAA-3¶.
PCR primers for stefin A were designed by using Primer Express Software
(Applied BioSystems) and sequences are forward 5¶-CTTGAAGAGCAAACCAATGAGAAA-3¶, reverse 5¶-AACAAATTTTGTCCAGCAACGA-3¶. Data were
quantified using a statistical method that corrects for PCR efficiency for

each reaction (41). The number of each gene-amplified product was
normalized to the number of cyclophilin amplified product.
Cysteine cathepsin activity assays. We used the cathepsin B detection
kit (Calbiochem) that measures the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate
Z-Arg-Arg-7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (42). Ear injection sites were collected with an 8-mm punch and extracted with lysis buffer. Lysates were
incubated as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Free 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured fluorometrically at 360/465 nm Ex/Em and calculated
from a standard curve. This experiment was repeated more than five times.
We also assessed cathepsin activity with the GB123 probe. Mice were
injected i.v. with 25 nmol GB123. After 8 h, ear sites were lysed in 700 AL of
lysis buffer. Seventy-five microliters of each sample were added to 25 AL
sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and scanned for
fluorescence at 633/670 nm Ex/Em (39).
Matrigel assays and quantification of microvessel density. Athymic
nude mice were injected s.c. with 0.3 mL of Matrigel supplemented, as
indicated, with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 2.5 mg/mL) and 8U
heparin, 2 mg/mL recombinant stefin A, cystatin C, cathepsin B (R&D
Systems), or 10 Amol/L CA-047Me (Calbiochem). bFGF was used in these

assays because it gives stronger and more consistent angiogenesis than
VEGF-A (43). At 6 d, Matrigel plugs were harvested and processed for
histology and CD31 immunohistochemistry. Mean vascular density was
calculated as above, counting CD31 positive structures with lumens. This
experiment was repeated thrice.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Dunn’s
multiple comparison test or unpaired t tests, as indicated.

Results
Degradation and subsequent neosynthesis of vascular
basement membranes in angiogenesis. In initial studies, we
injected an adenoviral vector expressing VEGF-A164 [108 plaqueforming unit (pfu) Ad-VEGF-A164] into the ears of nude mice to
mimic the angiogenic response induced by many tumors (2, 3). As
previously reported, the first new blood vessels to form were MV,
greatly enlarged, thin-walled structures that arose from preexisting
venules and that peaked at 5 days (7). Confocal microscopy on split
ears and immunohistochemistry on tissue sections showed a

striking, patchy loss of both laminin and collagen IV staining in the
MV induced by Ad-VEGF-A164 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 1A).
Similar degradation of vascular basement membrane laminin and
collagen IV was observed in the MV that developed in a mouse
mammary carcinoma (TA3/St) implanted s.c. in syngeneic A/J mice
(Fig. 1B).
Two laminin isoforms, 8 [a4h1g1] and 10 [a5h1g1], are
prominent components of vascular basement membranes (9–11).
Because h1 chains are common to both of these isoforms, we
measured h1 chains as surrogates of vascular basement membrane
degradation during the course of MV formation. Western blots
showed progressive fragmentation of laminin h1 chain over the
course of 1 to 5 days (loading control shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2; Fig. 1C), closely paralleling the course of MV formation
(Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 1A). At later times, low molecular

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

weight laminin h1 chain fragments were no longer detected;
instead, expression of intact laminin h1 chain as well as higher
molecular weight complexes were significantly increased (7 and
10 days; Fig. 1C). Consistent with this observation, formation of
glomeruloid microvascular proliferations, a prominent type of
daughter vessel that develops from MV after day 5 (3, 7), exhibited
extensive deposits of vascular basement membrane laminin
(Fig. 1D), as well as type IV collagen (data not shown).
Increased cathepsin expression and activity during MV
formation. To identify proteases that might be responsible for
degrading venular basement membranes, we first measured MMP-2
and MMP-9 because these proteases have been prominently
implicated in tumor biology (15, 17, 18). However, we were unable
to document a role for either in Ad-VEGF-A164–induced MV
formation. As measured by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
and zymography, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity
actually declined over the time course of MV formation (Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, we performed Affymetrix gene-chip
profiling and found that cathepsin B was expressed in normal ear
skin and was the most up-regulated (1.6-fold) protease in ears
harvested at 4 days after Ad-VEGF-A164 injection as MV were
approaching peak size and prominence. These findings were
confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, demonstrating that cathepsin
B was highly induced (8.1-fold) after Ad-VEGF-A164 injection,
reaching a peak on day 3 and then returning rapidly to baseline
levels (Fig. 2A, top). Cathepsin B is transcribed as a preproenzyme
and requires multiple posttranslational steps for activation. Of
potential interest, therefore, cathepsin D, an aspartic protease that
can activate procathepsin B, also increased after Ad-VEGF-A164
injection (f5-fold increase on day 3) and with similar kinetics,
although at much lower expression levels (Fig. 2A, bottom). Three
other cysteine proteases (cathepsins S, L, and H) were also detected
at low expression levels in normal mouse ears and showed different
expression patterns in response to Ad-VEGF-A164 (Fig. 2A, bottom).
We used immunohistochemistry to localize sites of cathepsin B
protein expression. We found that cathepsin B was expressed
strongly in many different cell types in normal ear skin, including
skeletal and arterial smooth muscle cells, epidermis, and some
interstitial cells but only faintly in venules. However, after AdVEGF-A164 injection, increased cathepsin B expression was
observed selectively in venules that were evolving into MV (Fig. 2B).
To provide additional evidence that cathepsins were involved in
MV formation, we incubated tissue extracts of Ad-VEGF-A164
injected ears with Z-Arg-Arg-7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin, a substrate commonly used to measure cathepsin B activity (Fig. 2C,
top). We found a progressive increase in substrate degradation that
peaked on day 5 and that remained elevated through day 14; in
contrast, the low levels of protease activity present in ears injected
with Ad-LacZ did not change over time.
To identify the cathepsins involved and better define the
changes in their expression levels over time, we made use of
GB123, a near-IR fluorescent probe that binds to the active sites
of cysteine cathepsins in vivo (39). Eight hours after injecting
GB123 i.v., ears were harvested, extracted, and processed for
SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C, middle). At 3 and 5 days after Ad-VEGF-A164
injection, and to a lesser extent at 7 days, we identified strong
32-kDa and weaker 28- and 24-kDa bands. These molecular
weights correspond to cathepsins B, S, and L, respectively, as
confirmed by immunoprecipitation (39). At 5 days after injecting
Ad-VEGF-A164, cathepsin B activity was found to be increased
f20-fold above control levels, whereas cathepsins S and L were

increased f12- and f24-fold, respectively (Fig. 2C, bottom).
Bands in Ad-Lac-Z injected ears were unchanged from the low
levels found in uninjected control ears.
GB123 can also be used to identify intracellular sites of
proteolytically active cathepsins by confocal microscopy. In
normal mice, faint staining (red) was observed in the cytoplasm
of occasional stromal cells, but activity was not detected in
blood vessels (Fig. 2D, NM). In contrast, on days 3 and 5 after
Ad-VEGF-A164 injection, strong cathepsin activity was observed
in perivascular cells that were immediately enveloping or
detaching from MV. In contrast, MV endothelial cells did not
stain with this probe.
Reduced expression of CPIs during MV formation. Cathepsin
activity is inhibited in normal tissues by high affinity, competitive
CPIs, including stefin A and cystatins B and C. We had noted in
preliminary Affymetrix gene chip experiments that stefin A was
down-regulated f5-fold at 4 days after Ad-VEGF-A164 injection.
We therefore measured mRNA expression levels of stefin A and of
the two other CPIs at different times after Ad-VEGF-A164 injection.
Quantitative RT-PCR showed that cystatin B and C mRNAs were
relatively abundant in normal ear skin but fell dramatically to
negligible levels over the first 3 days after Ad-VEGF-A164 injection
(Fig. 3A). At day 5, however, as MV formation peaked, both rose to
supranormal levels before gradually returning to lower values.
Stefin A mRNA was expressed at much lower levels in normal ears
and showed a complex, fluctuating expression pattern in response
to Ad-VEGF-A164 (Fig. 3B).
Immunohistochemistry of normal skin showed strong stefin A
and cystatin B and C staining in venular and arterial endothelial
cells, pericytes, and arterial smooth muscle cells, as well as in
epidermis, nerves, skeletal muscle, and some stromal cells (Fig. 3C).
However, staining of all three inhibitors was selectively lost from
venules as they evolved into MV at 3 days, although by 5 days, weak
staining had returned in some endothelial cells. Staining for
cystatin C, unlike that for stefin A and cystatin B, was also lost from
arterioles during this time frame, a change that may be related to
the arteriolar enlargement and arteriogenesis that Ad-VEGF-A164
induces apart from angiogenesis (44). Staining of these inhibitors
did not undergo detectable changes in nonvascular cells during the
course of MV formation.
Similar reciprocal vascular staining for cathepsin B and CPIs was
also observed in the MV induced by TA3/St mammary carcinomas
(Fig. 4).
Effects of cathepsin inhibitors on angiogenesis in the
Matrigel assay. To determine whether cathepsin B had a

functional role in angiogenesis in vivo, we evaluated the effects
of cathepsin B inhibitors on new blood vessel formation in the
Matrigel assay. As expected, bFGF induced a strong angiogenic
response in Matrigel plugs and this response was strongly inhibited
by stefin A (86%), cystatin C (92%), and the cathepsin inhibitor
CA074Me (91%; Fig. 5; refs. 45, 46).
Inhibition of Ad-VEGF-A164–induced angiogenesis in cathepsin B–null mice. To evaluate the importance of cathepsin B
in MV formation, we evaluated the angiogenic response induced by
5  108 pfu Ad-VEGF-A164 injected into the flank skin of wild-type
FVB and cathepsin B–null mice. As expected, Ad-VEGF-A164 induced
extensive MV formation in wild-type mice; by contrast, the
angiogenic response in cathepsin B–null mice was greatly inhibited
(Fig. 6A) and mean vascular density was strikingly reduced (P <
0.0001; Fig. 6B). As a further measure, we quantified Evan’s blue dye
accumulation in wild-type and cathepsin B–null mice. Evan’s blue
dye binds to plasma albumin and provides a measure of vascular
volume as well as early leakage from hyperpermeable blood vessels.
As shown in Fig. 6C, tissue bluing was reduced f50% in cathepsin B
null–mice, compared with wild-type controls.

Discussion
MV, the first new blood vessels to form in response to AdVEGF-A164 and in many mouse and human tumors, develop
from preexisting venules by a process that involves pericyte
detachment and extensive enlargement of cross-sectional area
(2, 3, 6–8, 36). We hypothesized that this enlargement would
require proteolytic degradation of venular basement membranes
because intact basement membranes strictly limit increases in
vascular diameter (12). We report here that venular basement
membrane proteins are indeed degraded during the course of
MV formation. Immunohistochemical staining for laminin and
type IV collagen was lost (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 1A) and
the laminin h1 chain was fragmented (Fig. 1C) over the 5-day
course of MV formation. Subsequently, MV evolved into daughter
glomeruloid microvascular proliferations, a vessel type that is
also found in many human tumors (2). Formation of glomeruloid
microvascular proliferations was accompanied by cessation of
laminin degradation, increased expression of laminin h1 chain
mRNA, and deposition of substantial amounts of laminin (and
collagen IV; data not shown) in a basement membrane
distribution (Fig. 1C and D).
MMPs, and especially MMPs 2 and 9, have been thought to be the
most important proteases involved in tumor angiogenesis (15, 17,

Ad-VEGF-A164–induced MV formation (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Instead, we found that MV formation was accompanied by strikingly
increased expression of cathepsin B mRNA (Fig. 2A). Cathepsin B is
expressed abundantly by many different cell types in normal skin.
However, immunohistochemistry showed that, after Ad-VEGF-A164
injection, cathepsin B expression was increased only in venules
transitioning into MV (Fig. 2B). In parallel, extracts of angiogenic
sites exhibited greatly increased hydrolysis of Z-Arg-Arg-7-Amino-4methylcoumarin, a substrate commonly used to measure cathepsin
B activity; this activity peaked as MV attained maximal frequency
and size on day 5 (Fig. 2C). Strong cathepsin B immunostaining of
MV was also observed in the MV induced by the VEGF-secreting
TA3/St mammary carcinoma (Fig. 4). Taken together, increased
expression of cathepsin B mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity
correlated closely with each other and with MV formation.
Further evidence for the importance of cathepsins in MV
formation was obtained using a recently developed fluorescent
activity based probe, GB123 (39). Three major bands of increased
cathepsin activity were detected at 3 to 7 days after Ad-VEGFA164 injection, and these were identified as cathepsins B, S, and
L, respectively (Fig. 2C). All three of these cathepsins are capable
of digesting basement membrane proteins (13). The GB123 probe
also allowed us to identify the cells that expressed cathepsin
activity by confocal microscopy. Whereas almost no staining was
observed in the vasculature of normal tissues, striking activity
was observed in the perivascular cells, but not in the endothelial
cells, of developing MV (Fig. 2D). Thus, pericytes, not endothelial
cells, express the cathepsin activity that is responsible for
venular basement membrane degradation and hence for the
pericyte detachment associated with MV formation.
Additional evidence for the importance of cathepsins in
angiogenesis was provided by experiments demonstrating that AdVEGF-A164–induced angiogenesis, as well as associated vascular
permeability, were strikingly reduced in cathepsin B–null mice

(Fig. 6). The residual angiogenesis that developed in these mice may
have resulted from the activities of cathepsins S and L, enzymes that
share both complementary and compensatory activities with
cathepsin B (22, 47–49). Unfortunately, doubly or triply cathepsin

knockout mice are poorly viable and therefore could not be tested
(47).
Ad-VEGF-A164 also induced reduced expression of CPI mRNAs
and protein in venules that were transitioning into MV (Fig. 3). The
MV induced by TA3/St mammary carcinomas also exhibited greatly
reduced expression of stefin A and cystatin C (Fig. 4). It is likely that
cystatin C has a more important role than either stefin A or cystatin
B in MV formation. Cystatin C mRNA is f100-fold more abundant in
normal ear skin than stefin A (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the inhibition
constant (Ki) of cystatin C for cathepsin B is 0.29 nmol/L, whereas
that of stefin A is 2.4 nmol/L and that of cystatin B is 19 nmol/L (50).
Finally, cystatin C is a secreted protein, whereas stefin A and cystatin
B are thought to remain largely within cells (27). Nonetheless, both
stefin A and cystatin C, as well as a nonspecific cathepsin protease
inhibitor, were effective in inhibiting bFGF-induced angiogenesis in
the Matrigel assay (Fig. 5).
In sum, our data provide strong, mechanistic evidence that,
whether induced by Ad-VEGF-A164 or by a VEGF-A–secreting tumor,
the venular basement membrane degradation associated with MV
formation results from a progressive increase in cathepsin activity,
accompanied by a decrease in CPI expression. Furthermore, these
reciprocal changes in cathepsin and CPI expression occurred
primarily in venules that were transitioning into MV and therefore
seem to be independent of cathepsins or CPIs expressed by tumor or
stromal cells. Together these data indicate that VEGF-A perturbs the

cathepsin-CPI balance in venules and that this is a critically
important step in MV formation, the earliest stage of VEGF-A–
induced angiogenesis. Remaining to be determined are the signaling
mechanism(s) by which VEGF-A up-regulates cathepsin and downregulates CPI expression and activity in venules transitioning into
MV, and the mechanisms by which the cathepsin-CPI balance is
subsequently restored as MV evolve into daughter vessels. Still other
questions concern the mechanisms that control cathepsin and CPI
exocytosis to the pericellular space and the means by which
exocytosed cathepsin B is activated. Answers to these questions are
needed to determine whether the cathepsin-CPI axis can be a useful
target for antiangiogenesis therapy.
