BACKGROUND. Over the past decade, a number of new therapeutic agents have
become available in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This study
characterized the use and assessed the impact on survival of population-based
access to new agents for the treatment of MBC.
METHODS. The dates of release in British Columbia of 7 new systemic agents for
MBC during the 1990s were used to construct 4 time cohorts. All patients with a
first diagnosis of distant metastases in each of the time cohorts were identified
and characterized, and their survival was compared. Cox proportional regression
modeling was used to assess for predictors of survival.

RESULTS. In total, 2150 patients with a first distant metastases diagnosed during
1 of the 4 cohort intervals were identified. Baseline characteristics between

of 18 to 24 months.4 Surprisingly, to our knowledge,
there have been no randomized controlled trials
comparing a palliative, systemic regimen with best
supportive care to demonstrate whether systemic
treatment improves survival in patients with MBC.
Today, it is unlikely that such a trial ever will be performed in this treatable disease.
There is recent epidemiological data to support a
significant fall in breast cancer mortality over the
past 15 years in both the U.K. and in the U.S.5,6
Much of this improvement in outcome has been
attributed to earlier detection strategies and to the
greater use of adjuvant hormone and cytotoxic treatments.6–8 Over the past decade, a number of trials
have demonstrated improved survival in MBC when
newer hormone agents or chemotherapeutic regimen(s) were compared with a previous standard.9–14
However, it is recognized that patients in clinical
trials are a highly selected group and are not necessarily representative of the general population of
patients with MBC.
In the current study, from a population-based
perspective, we examined temporal trends in the use
of hormone and chemotherapeutic agents for the
treatment of MBC and the corresponding survival
rates. We sought to establish whether populationbased access to newer systemic agents for the treatment of MBC improved survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The province of British Columbia (BC) had a population of approximately 4 million with close to 2700
new cases of breast cancer and 630 deaths from
breast cancer in 2006. Approximately 75% of all
patients with breast cancer in the province are
referred to a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA)
center. The BCCA has the mandate for cancer control
for the entire province. This includes the operation
of 4 regional cancer centers, which deliver all radiation therapy in the province, and the management of
the provincial budget for all systemic cancer therapies. The BCCA also is responsible for the establishment of provincial, evidence-based guidelines
regarding access to systemic agents in the treatment
of all solid and hematologic malignancies. A central
pharmacy database within the BCCA records the
date, drug, and dose of all systemic agents and their
indication in the treatment of a specific cancer in
every patient. The BCCA manages a Breast Cancer
Outcomes Database (BCOD), which contains detailed
demographic, pathologic, staging, treatment, and
outcome data for women who were diagnosed with

breast cancer since January 1, 1989 and were referred
to the BCCA. Information regarding the date and site
of first local, regional, and distant recurrence is collected prospectively. Dates and causes of death are
collected from the provincial death registry.
Based on the timing of the development and dissemination of breast cancer systemic therapy guidelines, we identified 4 time cohorts prior to and after
the introduction of various systemic therapy agents
used in the treatment of MBC in BC. Any patient
who was diagnosed with MBC (either primary presentation or first recurrence of distant metastases)
was included in that time cohort. For each individual
patient, the diagnosis of a distant metastasis is categorized prospectively in the BCOD as either clinical,
radiologic, or pathologic. Other criteria for study
inclusion were age 75 years at diagnosis of MBC
and the exclusion of patients who had another primary malignancy, except nonmelanoma skin cancer
or a new primary, contralateral breast cancer. The
first cohort, from January 1991 to December 1992,
was selected as the baseline comparator. The second
cohort, from January 1994 to December 1995, was
the period during which paclitaxel and vinorelbine
were released in BC for the treatment of MBC. The
third cohort, from January 1997 to December 1998,
was after the approval of the aromatase inhibitors
and docetaxel for MBC. The fourth cohort, from July
1999 to June 2001, identified the period of access to
trastuzumab and capecitabine. Patients in any of the
cohort intervals identified by the BCOD were linked
through the BCCA pharmacy database to collate the
chemotherapeutic and/or hormone therapies that
were dispensed for each individual. Ethical approval
for the study was obtained from the governing
research ethics board.

Statistical Analysis
Baseline demographic and pathologic prognostic factors and the individual treatments dispensed for
patients in the 4 cohorts were identified and compared between cohorts. An analysis of variance test
was used to assess for statistical significance for continuous variables, whereas chi-square analysis was
performed for categorical variables. Overall survival
was defined as the interval from the date of diagnosis of distant metastasis to death from any cause. All
patients who remained alive at the date of last analysis were censored. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
within each cohort were calculated and compared
with a Tarone-Ware test. A Cox regression model was
used for the multivariable analysis. Assumptions of
proportionality of hazards were verified by inspection
of the log-hazard plots versus time and Schoenfeld

residuals of the Cox model for all variables. Statistical
analyses were performed with both SPSS software
(version 10.1) and SPlus software (version 5).
The data were analyzed by 5 of the authors
(S.K.C., C.H.S., Y.D., A.C. and I.A.O.). The article was
drafted by S.K.C. and was modified after review by
the other coauthors. S.K.C. had full access to all the
data in the study and had final responsibility for the
decision to submit for publication.

in Cohort 4 had positive ER status (P 5 .01). However, this did not translate into a difference in the
proportion of patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen between the cohorts. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy varied between the 4 cohorts. Only 43% of
patients in Cohort 1 received any form of adjuvant
chemotherapy versus close to 60% of patients in
Cohorts 3 and 4 (P < .001). The interval from diagnosis of the primary breast cancer to the time of distant
recurrence was significantly longer in the later
cohorts (P < .001). This was associated with greater
use of adjuvant chemotherapy and a lower percentage of patients presenting with de novo metastases
in the later cohorts (20%–22% in Cohorts 3 and 4 vs
27% in Cohort 1; P 5 .004). Another contributing factor for this difference may have been the shorter
interval between the earlier cohorts and inception of
the BCOD (1989).

RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics
In total, 2150 patients who fulfilled the study criteria
were identified from the BCOD; 423 patients were
identified for Cohort 1 (1991–1992), 561 patients
were identified for Cohort 2 (1994–1995), 641 patients
were identified for Cohort 3 (1997–1998), and 525
patients were identified for Cohort 4 (1999–2001).
The proportion of patients within each cohort who
presented with distant metastasis as their initial diagnosis of breast cancer was 27%, 18%, 20%, and 22%
for Cohorts 1 through 4, respectively. The proportion
of patients who developed distant metastasis within
5 years of their original primary breast cancer diagnosis was 70% for Cohort 1, 68% for Cohort 2, 57%
for Cohort 3, and 50% for Cohort 4. At the time of
analysis, 93%, 93%, 83%, and 58% of patients had
died in Cohorts 1 through 4, respectively. Of the 2150
patients who were included in this study, the method
of diagnosis of distant metastasis was clinical in 7.5%
of patients, radiologic in 69.2% of patients, pathologic in 22% of patients, and unknown in the remaining 1.3% of patients. The baseline demographic and
pathologic factors and the adjuvant therapies
received between the cohorts are shown in Table 1.
The 4 cohorts were similar in terms of age at diagnosis of distant metastasis, distribution of pathologic
prognostic factors of the primary tumor (tumor size,
grade, axillary lymph node involvement, and lymphatic or vascular invasion), and sites of first distant
metastases (categorized as visceral vs soft tissue and/
or bone). There was a difference in the proportions
of estrogen receptor (ER) status between the 4
cohorts: Fifty-nine percent of patients in Cohorts 1
and 2 had positive ER status, 63% of patients in
Cohort 3 had positive ER status, and 69% of patients

Systemic Therapies Received for MBC
The various chemotherapeutic and hormone agents
that were received for the treatment of MBC by
patients in each of the 4 time cohorts are outlined in
Table 2. Only the agents that were used commonly
and within the BCCA guidelines were reviewed. Over
time, a greater proportion of patients received some
form of palliative systemic therapy for the treatment
of MBC. In the time cohort of from 1991 to 1992,
25% of patients did not receive either a palliative
hormone or chemotherapeutic agent compared with
only 10% in the later cohorts (P < .001). There was
no significant difference in either the mean or the
median number of treatments delivered between the
cohorts. The utilization data demonstrated that, once
a new agent was released for use (ie, funded by the
BCCA), the newer agent began to be used. For example, just prior to formal funding approval of the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (Cohort 2), this class
of hormones was used in only 16% of patients compared with 44% (Cohort 3) after it was approved for
use in the BCCA. Another trend was the reduced use
of anthracyclines and tamoxifen for MBC in the later
cohorts. This was correlated with an increased use of
anthracyclines and tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting.
The taxane docetaxel, the monoclonal antibody to
HER-2 (trastuzumab), and the 5-fluororacil (5-FU)
prodrug capecitabine all were used more commonly
in the later time cohorts.
Overall Survival Across the Cohorts
There was a significant improvement in survival for
women with MBC over time. Although there was no
difference between the first 2 cohorts, the later 2
cohorts had significant improvements in overall

survival. The median survival for patients in Cohorts
1 through 4 was 436 days, 450 days, 564 days, and
661 days respectively. Tarone-Ware tests showed significantly improved survival for Cohort 3 versus
Cohorts 1 and 2 (P 5 .002) and for Cohort 4 versus
cohort 3 (P 5 .05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves for
all 4 cohorts are shown in Figure 1. The 1-year survival rate was 55% for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2,
64% for Cohort 3, and 71% for Cohort 4. The 2-year
survival rate in the first 2 cohorts (1991–1995) was
33% to 34% compared with the corresponding 2-year
survival rate of 44% to 45% for the later 2 cohorts
(1997–2001). When the analysis was limited to
patients who either presented with de novo distant
metastases or developed a distant recurrence within
5 years of their initial primary breast cancer diagnosis, the results were similar (data not presented).

Multivariate Analysis of Predictors of Survival
The following variables were included in the prediction model jointly: age at diagnosis of metastasis,
grade of the primary tumor (grade 1 and 2 vs grade 3),
sites of first metastases (bone/soft tissue vs visceral),
ER status (positive, negative, or unknown), use of adjuvant hormone therapy (yes or no), use of adjuvant
chemotherapy (yes or no) and the 4 time cohorts. The
results are summarized in Table 3. All factors except
for adjuvant hormone or chemotherapy were highly
significant, independent predictors of survival in
patients with MBC. High grade, negative ER status,
young age (<35 years), and older age (65 years) all
were associated with a worse outcome, as expected.
The site of distant metastases was significant for survival both as a sole predictor and in a model with the
other variables; however, because this factor did not

to our knowledge that demonstrates a significant
improvement in survival over time. After adjustment
for several covariates, the survival of women who
were diagnosed with MBC in BC in the later part of
the 1990s improved by approximately 30% compared

978

CANCER

September 1, 2007 / Volume 110 / Number 5

with a similar cohort of women who were diagnosed
in the early and middle parts of the 1990s. This
improvement in survival was observed even though a
greater proportion of women in the later cohorts already had been exposed to prior chemotherapy (in
the adjuvant setting). The primary objectives of systemic therapy for women with MBC are to improve/
maintain quality of life and, hopefully, to prolong
survival. However, we believe there has never been a
randomized controlled trial comparing a systemic
agent with best supportive care to prove that survival
can be improved by the treatment of MBC. In the
current era of multiple, active agents available for
the treatment of MBC, it is improbable and likely
unethical that this type of study ever will be performed. In the early part of the 1990s, 25% of
patients in BC did not receive any palliative systemic
therapy, compared with only 10% in the later part of
the decade. Thus, the current study appears to serve
as a surrogate to suggest that systemic therapy for
MBC is associated with improved survival.
A recent publication from a single institution
also suggested an improvement in survival in recent
cohorts of patients who were diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer.15 The authors analyzed the survival of 834 women who previously had received an
adjuvant anthracycline regimen at the University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and who subsequently developed recurrent breast cancer (local, regional, or distant) between 1974 and 2000. By
dividing the period of their study into 5 time cohorts,
they demonstrated in univariate analysis that the
median survival improved from 15 months to 58
months in a comparison of their earliest cohort
(1974–1979) with their later cohort (1995–2000). In
multivariate analysis, the year of recurrence was
associated with a trend toward improved survival.
There are several important differences between the
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center study and ours. Our
study was larger, it was population-based, it included
only patients who had distant metastases, and we
linked the systemic treatments received by each
patient with the cohort’s outcome. A study from the
French comprehensive cancer centers demonstrated
a virtual doubling of the 5-year survival rate for
women with MBC who were diagnosed in the late
1990s compared with the early 1980s, but those
investigators also did not link individual treatment
data for MBC and outcome.16
Over the past decade, there have been 6 large
randomized trials that demonstrated an improvement in overall survival of 1 palliative agent/regimen
compared with another systemic agent in the treatment of MBC.9–14 Two of those studies involved the

use of the newer class of aromatase inhibitors versus
a progestational agent in postmenopausal women
with advanced breast cancer.9,10 Two of the studies
compared the taxane docetaxel either with another
chemotherapeutic regimen (mitomycin C and vinblastine)11 or with another taxane (paclitaxel).14 The
other 2 studies were in patients who received combinations of chemotherapy either with a monoclonal
antibody to HER-2 (trastuzumab)12 or with combination docetaxel and an oral 5-FU agent (capecitabine)13 versus the standard chemotherapy alone.
From the results from our current study, we cannot attribute the improved survival conclusively to a
single agent or regimen. However, we can state that
there were differences in the use of newer agents/regimens over time, and these differences appear to be
associated with improved survival. It is noteworthy
that the greatest differences in survival were associated with the introduction of the aromatase inhibitors, docetaxel and trastuzumab, in the later 2 cohorts.
These data appear to support the notion that widespread access to newer therapies that have demonstrated improved survival in highly selected patients
on clinical trials do appear to translate into population-based survival benefits. In addition to potentially
improving survival, some of the newer agents also may
have less toxicity (eg, aromatase inhibitors compared
with progesterone agents). Furthermore, if some of the
older agents had greater morbidity that could lead to
mortality, then the decreased use of these agents also
may have contributed to the improved survival.
One potential confounding factor of this study
may be lead-time bias if improved diagnostic testing
led to an earlier diagnosis of metastatic disease. We
do not believe that such an ascertainment bias
would have had any significant impact on the
improved survival seen. The follow-up guidelines
within the province of BC over the entire period of
the study were consistent with the American Society
of Clinical Oncology recommendations of clinical
follow-up without routine laboratory or radiologic
investigations in the absence of clinical suspicion of
recurrent disease.17 Our large number of patients, all
studied within a recent decade (1990s), also makes it
less likely that changes in imaging technology could
explain the observed improved survival after 1995.
Furthermore, there even was a survival difference
over the 4 years between the 1997 to 1998 cohort
and the 1999 to 2001 cohort. Other limitations of this
study include the unequal duration of follow-up in
later cohorts and the increased use of adjuvant
chemotherapy in the later cohorts. In attempts to
address the issue of unequal duration of follow-up
between cohorts, we performed additional analyses

in which the cohorts were limited to patients who
either presented with de novo distant metastases
or developed distant recurrence within 5 years of
their initial primary breast cancer diagnosis, and the
results were similar to those for the entire original
cohort. The observation of increased use of adjuvant
chemotherapy in the later cohorts, in fact, could
have reduced the effectiveness of palliative systemic
therapy in these groups, because a greater proportion
were no longer ‘‘chemotherapy naive.’’
In conclusion, we believe that this is the first
study to demonstrate a population-based improvement in survival for women with a recent diagnosis
of MBC. This improvement in survival appeared to
be caused by the availability and use of newer and
more effective systemic agents for the treatment of
MBC. Although MBC still is an incurable disease, this
study provides optimism for those women who are
diagnosed with MBC today and should provide enthusiasm and evidence that continued research to
discover better therapies may translate into further
improvements in outcome in the future.
