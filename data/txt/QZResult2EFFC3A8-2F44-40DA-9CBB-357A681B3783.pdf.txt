ABSTRACT:
Radiation therapy (RT) is used for local tumor control through direct killing of
tumor cells. Radiation-induced cell death can trigger tumor antigen-specific immune
responses, but these are often noncurative. Radiation has been demonstrated to
induce immunogenic modulation (IM) in various tumor types by altering the biology
of surviving cells to render them more susceptible to T cell-mediated killing. Little
is known about the mechanism(s) underlying IM elicited by sub-lethal radiation
dosing. We have examined the molecular and immunogenic consequences of radiation
exposure in breast, lung, and prostate human carcinoma cells. Radiation induced
secretion of ATP and HMGB1 in both dying and surviving tumor cells. In vitro and in
vivo tumor irradiation induced significant upregulation of multiple components of the
antigen-processing machinery and calreticulin cell-surface expression. Augmented
CTL lysis specific for several tumor-associated antigens was largely dictated by the
presence of calreticulin on the surface of tumor cells and constituted an adaptive
response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, mediated by activation of the unfolded
protein response.
This study provides evidence that radiation induces a continuum of immunogenic
alterations in tumor biology, from immunogenic modulation to immunogenic cell
death. We also expand the concept of immunogenic modulation, where surviving
tumor cells recovering from radiation-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress become
more sensitive to CTL killing. These observations offer a rationale for the combined
use of radiation with immunotherapy, including for patients failing RT alone.

INTRODUCTION

cells are exposed to a lethal dose of radiation.
Preclinical studies in various tumor models have
shown that exposing tumor cells to lethal doses of
radiation can elicit cell death while inducing strong
antitumor immunity in a process initially described by
Zitvogel and Kroemer et al. as immunogenic cell death
(ICD) [1-3]. However, in a clinical setting, immune
responses elicited by radiation alone rarely result in
protective immunity, as locoregional relapse often occurs
[4, 5]. Recent studies have demonstrated that RT has

Radiation therapy (RT) is standard of care for
multiple malignancies, including carcinomas of the
breast, lung, and prostate. Whether the intent is cure
or palliation, the goal of RT is direct tumor-cell killing
and/or modulation of tumor or stromal architecture.
However, dose delivery constraints dictated by the need
to limit damage to healthy tissues often result in dose

immunomodulatory consequences through direct action on
surviving tumor cells and/or cells of the immune system
[6-10]. We previously reported that radiation alters the
biology of surviving tumor cells, rendering them more
susceptible to T cell-mediated killing [6, 8]. We also
demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies that
radiation combined with vaccine elicits greater tumor
antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and/or reduction
in tumor burden than either modality alone [10, 11]. Here,
we examined radiation’s ability to induce immunogenic
modulation (IM) of breast cancer, non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and prostate cancer cells, thus increasing
their susceptibility to CD8+ CTL-mediated lysis.
Importantly, we also examined the molecular mechanisms
associated with IM of tumors. T cell-mediated killing
relies on the recognition of specific CD8+-restricted
epitopes associated with MHC class I molecules on the
surface of tumor cells, which is dictated by the cooperative
action of multiple elements of the antigen-processing
machinery (APM). Mounting evidence suggests that
APM defects in tumor cells have a detrimental effect on
T-cell recognition [12-15]. Radiation has been shown
to modulate the peptide repertoire, enhance MHC I
expression, and increase the activity of TAP1 [6, 8, 16].
We hypothesized that radiation could induce IM of tumorcell phenotype and APM components, thereby enhancing
productive interactions between CD8+ CTLs and tumor
cells. Thus, we examined the effects of radiation on
molecules that have been implicated in enhancing CTL-

RESULTS
Radiation induces dose-dependent alterations
in human carcinoma cells ranging from
immunogenic modulation to cardinal signs of
immunogenic cell death
High-dose radiation has been reported to induce
ICD in preclinical models [1, 2]. The cardinal signs of ICD
are (a) calreticulin exposure on the surface of dying cells,
(b) secretion of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)
protein, (c) release of ATP, and most importantly, (d) cell
death. Each of these molecules stimulates dendritic cells to

components [17]. These studies are the first to report (a)
an evaluation of cardinal signs of ICD and immunogenic
modulation following radiation of breast, lung, and
prostate carcinoma cell lines, (b) the use of radiation to
functionally increase expression of APM components in
vitro and in vivo, and (c) the functional role of calreticulin

stress on IM and increased sensitivity to CTL killing of
tumor cells that survive radiotherapy. These findings offer
a rationale for the use of radiation in combination with
immunotherapy, including for patients who have failed
radiation therapy or have limited treatment options.

promote heightened immune responses [2, 18-20].
We first examined the in vitro effect of different
doses of radiation on growth, viability, and cardinal signs
of ICD in 3 human carcinoma cell lines: breast (MDAMB-231), lung (H522), and prostate (LNCaP). Cells were
mock-irradiated (0 Gy) or subjected to 10 or 100 Gy.
Mitoxantrone was used as a positive control to induce ICD
[20]. Exposure to 100 Gy significantly decreased growth
and viability over 72 h in all cell lines relative to controls
(P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A). In each cell line, cells exposed to
100 Gy showed < 50% viability at 72 h post-irradiation
and released significant amounts of ATP (Fig. 1B) and
HMGB1 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, 10 Gy significantly reduced

growth in all cell lines (P ≤ 0.005) without significantly
reducing viability (Fig. 1A), yet also induced significant
ATP release in lung cancer cells (Fig. 1B; P = 0.0002)
and HMGB1 secretion in lung (P = 0.0003) and prostate
(P = 0.0007) cancer cells (Fig. 1C). Mitoxantrone-treated
cells were not viable 72 h post-treatment and released
significant amounts of ATP (P ≤ 0.007) and HMGB1
(P ≤ 0.003) relative to controls. These data indicate that
radiation induces dose-dependent immunogenic alterations
in human carcinoma cells ranging from cardinal signs of
ICD to immunogenic modulation.

Sublethal irradiation of human carcinoma cells
significantly increases sensitivity to antigenspecific CTL lysis
Exposing human HNSCC, colon, and prostate
carcinoma cells to sublethal irradiation has previously
been shown to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to
CTL lysis [6, 8, 21]. We sought to confirm and extend
these findings to breast (MDA-MB-231), lung (H522), and
prostate (LNCaP) carcinoma cells. MDA-MB-231 cells
were mock-irradiated (0 Gy) or given 10 Gy as a single
dose or 2 Gy/day for 5 days. As shown in Figure 2, 72 h
after exposure to 10 Gy in either a single or fractionated
dose, breast carcinoma cells were significantly more
sensitive to CEA-specific T cell-mediated lysis (P =
0.0006). Since results were similar with single and
fractionated dosing, we chose to use a single 10-Gy dose
in subsequent experiments. Exposing breast carcinoma
cells to 10 Gy also increased their sensitivity to MUC1- (P = 0.001) and brachyury-specific T-cell lysis (P =
0.005), and significantly increased the sensitivity of lung
and prostate carcinoma cells to CTLs specific for CEA (P
= 0.0002, P < 0.0001, respectively), MUC-1 (P = 0.013,
P = 0.006, respectively), and brachyury (P = 0.0002, P <
0.0001, respectively). Irradiated prostate carcinoma cells
were also more sensitive to PSA-specific lysis relative to
controls (P = 0.01). CTL killing was MHC I-restricted
as determined by anti-HLA-A2 blocking antibody (P <
0.0001) (Fig. 2).
These data indicate that exposure to sublethal doses
of radiation enhances antigen-specific CTL-mediated
killing across multiple carcinoma types, and that this effect
can be extended to a variety of tumor-associated antigens
(TAAs).

Figure 2: Tumor cells exposed to sublethal radiation
demonstrate significantly increased sensitivity to
antigen-specific CTL killing. Human breast (MDA-

MB-231), lung (H522), and prostate (LNCaP) carcinoma cells
were mock-irradiated (0 Gy; open bars) or exposed to a single
dose of 10 Gy (black bars). Indicated cells were exposed to
fractionated radiation (2 Gy × 5; hatched bars). After 72 h, cells
were used as targets in a CTL lysis assay using CEA-, MUC-1-,
brachyury-, or PSA-specific CD8+ T cells as effector cells at an
E:T ratio of 30:1. To verify CTL specificity, tumor cells were
incubated with anti-HLA-A2 mAb or matched isotype control.
Results are presented as mean ± S.E.M. from 3–6 replicate wells.

CD8+-restricted epitope complexes on the surface of
tumor cells. The presence and repertoire of MHC I/
epitope complexes on the surface of tumor cells is
dictated by the cooperative interactions of multiple APM
components. Hypothesizing that radiation could modulate
the expression of APM components, we exposed breast
(MDA-MB-231), lung (H522), and prostate (LNCaP)
carcinoma cells to 0 or 10 Gy. At 72 h post-irradiation,
we examined cells by flow cytometry for intracellular
expression of 7 APM components (Fig. 3A). In each tumor
cell line, exposure to radiation significantly increased the
expression of ≥ 6 APM components by ≥ 30%, namely
the immunoproteosome subunits LMP2, LMP7, and
LMP10; the peptide transporters TAP1 and TAP2; and the
chaperones calnexin (2/3 cell lines) and tapasin (3/3 cell
lines). These data indicate that sublethal radiation induces
significant and widespread upregulation of most APM

components across multiple tumor types, which is likely to
result in increased T-cell recognition and lysis of irradiated
tumor targets.
Because several proteins present on the surface
of tumor cells have previously been demonstrated to be
critical for interactions with CD8+ T cells [6], we also
examined the effect of sublethal radiation on phenotypic
modulation of breast, lung, and prostate carcinoma
targets. We exposed cells to 0 or 10 Gy and monitored
cell-surface expression of MHC I, ICAM-1, CEA,
MUC-1, and calreticulin by flow cytometry 72 h posttreatment. As shown in Figure 3A, exposure to radiation
induced significant cell-surface expression of MHC I
(3/3 cell lines), ICAM-1 (3/3), CEA (2/3), and MUC-1
(3/3), regardless of carcinoma type. We also observed a
significant translocation of the ER chaperone calreticulin
to the cell surface 72 h after exposure to sublethal

radiation in 3/3 cell lines (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these
data indicate that exposure of human carcinoma cells to
sublethal radiation induces IM across disparate tumor
types, as evidenced by increased expression of multiple
APM components and translocation of calreticulin to the
cell surface of tumor targets in the absence of cell death.

radiation therapy modulates the expression of APM
components regardless of dosing regimen (data not
shown).

Exposure to radiation in vivo increases expression
of APM components and promotes cell-surface
expression of calreticulin in carcinoma cells
To confirm that in vivo exposure to sublethal
radiation modulates APM elements and calreticulin
translocation to the surface of carcinoma cells, nude
mice (n = 2/group) were implanted with LNCaP tumors
and exposed to 0 or 10 Gy. Immunohistochemistry
analysis of prostate carcinomas 72 h post-irradiation
showed increased expression of the immunoproteosome
components LMP2 and LMP7, the peptide transporter
TAP2, and the chaperones tapasin and calreticulin (Fig.
4). However, tumor irradiation did not modulate ICAM1 expression. Pixel analysis of one representative tumor
indicated that < 50% of tumor cells in non-irradiated
carcinomas were positive for LMP2, but none exhibited
strong protein levels. However, post-irradiation, the
population of tumor cells expressing LMP2 increased
2-fold, with 10% showing strong LMP2 expression.
Similar increases in LMP2 expression were observed in
all tumors exposed to radiation. Radiation also induced
a marked increase in expression of TAP2 (3.9-fold) and
tapasin (2.1-fold average) relative to untreated controls.
Calreticulin is heterogeneously expressed in untreated
LNCaP tumors. As seen in Figure 4, calreticulin was
absent in > 70% of tumor cells, with only 2% expressing
strong protein levels. Further, calreticulin localization was
diffuse (inset panel). However, after exposure to radiation,
positive calreticulin expression increased > 1.9-fold on
average, a significant upregulation relative to controls.
Radiation also caused a 6.5-fold increase in tumor cells
with strong calreticulin expression relative to nonirradiated controls. Moreover, calreticulin expression in
carcinoma cells exposed to radiation was associated with
the cell membrane (inset, black arrows). In non-irradiated
tumors, calreticulin membrane staining was 34.7% ±
20.4% vs. tumors exposed to radiation, where calreticulin
membrane staining increased to 78.7% ± 13.1%. These
data confirm that radiation is an immunogenic modulator
in vivo, as evidenced by widespread upregulation of APM
components and increased translocation of calreticulin to
the surface of carcinoma cells.
In a separate experiment where LNCaP xenografts
(n = 5/group) were examined 72 h after exposure to 10 Gy
as a single dose or in daily fractions of 2 Gy, no significant
differences in LMP2, LMP7, TAP2, or tapasin expression
were observed between both treatments, suggesting that

exogenous calreticulin would promote those interactions.
Following RNA interference in MDA-MB-231 cells,
total expression of calreticulin and PERK decreased by
36% and 96%, respectively (Fig. 5A). In both cases, the
expression of calreticulin on the cell surface was abrogated
without decreasing MHC I or ICAM-1 expression
(Supplemental Fig. 1). As before, MDA-MB-231 cells
were lysed by CEA-specific T cells to a significantly
greater extent after exposure to 10 Gy radiation (Fig.
5B; P < 0.0001). However, this increased killing was
abrogated in carcinoma cells with reduced expression of
calreticulin or PERK (P < 0.0001). Similar results were
observed with LNCaP cells (data not shown). In addition,
MDA-MB-231 cells co-incubated with control peptide
were killed to a significantly greater level after exposure to
radiation (Fig. 5C; P < 0.0001). However, in the presence
of calreticulin-blocking peptide, the radiation-induced
increase in CTL lysis of MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells
was significantly reduced (Fig. 5C; P < 0.0001). As a
control, incubation of the CEA-specific CTL used in these
assays with calreticulin-blocking peptide did not affect
T-cell viability (data not shown). Further, MDA-MB-231
cells co-incubated in the absence or presence of control
protein were equally lysed, and to a significantly higher
level after exposure to radiation (Fig. 5D; P < 0.0001).

Calreticulin is a critical component of antigen
processing and loading into MHC I [22, 23]. Based on
its upregulation and, more importantly, its translocation
to the cell surface across disparate tumor types (Figs. 3B
and 4) in response to sublethal radiation, we hypothesized
that surface calreticulin plays an additional role in IM as
it pertains to increased CTL-mediated lysis. We analyzed
the role of surface calreticulin in IM by: (a) siRNA
knockdown of the serine/threonine kinase PERK, which
mediates translocation of calreticulin to the cell surface,
where knockdown of calreticulin was used as a positive
control [3], (b) use of a calreticulin-blocking peptide [24],
and (c) addition of exogenous calreticulin protein. We
expected that knockdown of calreticulin would prevent
normal APM functions and thus impair T-cell recognition
of tumor [22]; that silencing of PERK would maintain
APM functions but prevent calreticulin translocation [3,
17]; and that peptide blocking would prevent surface
calreticulin/T-cell interactions, whereas the presence of

cells were exposed to 0 or 10 Gy 72 h prior to being used as targets in a CEA-specific CTL-lysis assay in the presence of (C) calreticulinblocking or LCMV control peptides or (D) human calreticulin or serum albumin proteins. CD8+ T cells were used as effector cells at an E:T
ratio of 30:1. Results are presented as mean ± S.E.M. from 3-6 replicate wells. Asterisks denote statistical significance relative to controls

cell surface.

However, in the presence of exogenous calreticulin, the
level of CTL lysis of MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells
exposed to radiation increased further relative to irradiated
targets plus control protein (P < 0.0001). Exogenous
calreticulin also augmented CTL-mediated lysis of nonirradiated carcinoma targets relative to targets plus control
protein (P < 0.0001). Collectively, these data indicate that

Radiation-induced immunogenic modulation of
carcinoma cells is mediated by ER stress

by 7-AAD exclusion (data not shown). Collectively,
these data suggest that the increased sensitivity of human
carcinoma cells to CTL-mediated lysis after exposure to
radiation is a result of a cellular survival response to ER
stress mediated through the UPR.

Calreticulin exposure and induction of ER molecular
chaperones can occur under certain conditions of ER stress
[25]. ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response
(UPR), an evolutionarily conserved quality control
mechanism, which attempts to restore ER homeostasis
through a cascade of cellular events, including transient
arrest of protein translation and upregulation of ER protein
chaperones. We hypothesized that radiation induces ER
stress on tumor cells, which then triggers an adaptive
response through the UPR, resulting in immunogenic
modulation and increased sensitivity to CTL killing (Fig.
6A). We examined the effect of radiation on expression
of various proteins induced by the UPR in response to
ER stress. Induction of calreticulin and BiP (or Grp78),
2 abundant ER chaperone proteins with important roles
in the maintenance of ER homeostasis, is a symptom of
ER stress [15, 23, 26]. Phosphorylation of eIF2a occurs in
response to ER stress through the PERK-mediated branch
of the UPR [26].
We exposed MDA-MB-231 cells to 0 or 10 Gy
and examined levels of calreticulin, BiP, total eIF2a,
and phosphorylated eIF2a at the indicated time points.
Tumor cells exposed to the ER stress inducer thapsigargin
were used as positive controls. Radiation increased the
expression of calreticulin, BiP, and phosphorylated eIF2a
in a time-dependent manner, similar to that observed after
thapsigargin treatment, indicating that radiation induces
ER stress and that in response to it, cells upregulate
APM components (Fig. 6B and Supplemental Fig. 2).
Identical results were obtained with LNCaP cells (data
not shown). Thapsigargin treatment of MDA-MB-231
cells significantly increased cell-surface expression of
HLA-A2, ICAM-1, and MUC-1, without modulating
CEA protein levels (Supplemental Table 1). Similarly to
radiation, thapsigargin-induced ER stress significantly
increased the intracellular expression of multiple APM
components, including LMP2, LMP7, TAP1, TAP2, and
the protein chaperones calnexin, tapasin, and calreticulin
(Supplemental Table 1). However, and in contrast to
radiation, it did not promote calreticulin translocation
to the surface of MDA-MB-231 cells (not shown), in
accordance with other reports [3]. These data indicate that
the survival response orchestrated by human carcinoma
cells in reaction to sublethal radiation includes the
PERK-mediated branch of the UPR. To examine the
functional consequence of radiation-induced ER stress/
UPR, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells as previously
described and used them 48 h later as targets in a CEAspecific CTL lysis assay. As before, carcinoma-cell lysis
increased significantly after exposure to radiation (Fig.
6C). Importantly, lysis of carcinoma cells significantly
increased after exposure to thapsigargin (P < 0.0001),
which had no effect on cellular viability, as determined

DISCUSSION
Radiation has been shown to induce IM in a wide
variety of carcinoma types by altering the biology of
surviving tumor cells to render them more susceptible to
T cell-mediated killing [6, 8]. Radiation-induced tumorcell death can occur through multiple mechanisms [27].
Studies in preclinical models have shown that radiationinduced tumor-cell death is immunogenic and thus
elicits strong antitumor immunity, a process described by
Zitvogel and Kroemer et al. as immunogenic cell death
(ICD) [1-3]. However, immune responses observed in
patients treated with radiation alone are often weak and
do not result in protective immunity [4, 11].
Here we report that radiation induces cardinal signs
of ICD (cell death and release of ATP and HMGB1) in
multiple carcinoma types (Fig. 1). The highest dose used
here (100 Gy) is above the clinical range and was selected
to ensure cell death in all cell lines examined; however,
the ATP and HMGB1 secretion we observed at a sublethal
(10 Gy) dose suggests that ICD may be achieved clinically
[4, 27]. We made similar observations in experiments with
breast (MCF-7), lung (NCI-H1703), and prostate (DU145 and PC-3) carcinoma cell lines (data not shown).
These findings support the premise that therapeutic cancer
vaccines can exploit the immunostimulatory environment
created by RT to achieve robust and effective antitumor
immune responses in multiple carcinomas [9, 10, 28, 29].
This concept is further supported by our findings
that tumor cells of distinct origin and genotype that
survive radiation exposure are significantly more sensitive
to CTL lysis (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the cells’ sensitivity to
CTL lysis was enhanced regardless of their p53 or K-Ras
mutation status or triple-negative phenotype. Mutations
in p53 occur in ~ 50% of cancers, including ~ 80% of
triple-negative breast cancers, and render tumors resistant
to RT, whereas the frequent presence of K-Ras mutations
in NSCLC or triple-negative breast cancers severely limits
treatment options [27, 30-32]. This effect can be extended
to a variety of TAAs, expanding prior observations in
carcinomas of the head and neck, colon, and prostate [6,
8, 21].
Distinct gene signatures have been reported in
human prostate and breast carcinoma cells exposed in
vitro and in vivo to single (10 Gy) or fractionated (2 Gy ×
5) doses of radiation [32, 33]. Despite different molecular
profiles, our data (Fig. 2) indicate that radiation-induced
tumor sensitivity to CTL lysis is equally augmented with
single or fractionated doses of radiation, suggesting that
either regimen could elicit effective antitumor immune

the surface of tumor cells, the presence of which relies
on the proper function of multiple APM components
(Fig. 6A). Defective expression and/or function of APM
components results in poor CD8+ T-cell recognition [1214]. APM defects have been identified in established
human cancer cell lines and patient lesions, and have been
correlated with poor clinical outcome across multiple
tumor types [34, 35]. Here we demonstrate that exposure
of human breast, lung, and prostate carcinoma cells to
sublethal radiation induces a significant increase in protein
expression of multiple APM components, including that
of immunoproteosome subunits, peptide transporters, and
protein chaperones, both in vitro (Fig. 3) and in vivo (Fig.
4). Similar results were observed in vitro with additional
breast (MCF-7) and lung (NCI-H1703) carcinoma cells
(data not shown). Although ICAM-1 expression was
modulated following radiation exposure in vitro (Fig. 3), it
was not upregulated after radiation exposure in vivo (Fig.
4), which suggests a role for the tumor microenvironment
in ICAM-1 regulation, in agreement with other reports
[36]. Further, no significant differences in APM
modulation in vivo were observed between fractionated
(2 Gy × 5) and single dose (10 Gy × 1) radiation. These
results extend the findings of previous reports showing
that radiation increases MHC I expression and TAP1
activity and alters the peptide repertoire presented by
MHC I molecules [6, 16]. Based on the findings reported
here (Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4), it is reasonable to anticipate that
tumor cells not eradicated by RT may undergo IM, thus
becoming more susceptible to killing by vaccine-induced
CTLs. This is supported by previous [7, 8] and current
findings (Fig. 3) demonstrating increased expression of
TAAs and other proteins contributing to efficient CTL
lysis, such as MHC I and ICAM-1, following exposure
of tumor cells to sublethal radiation. These findings
also corroborate both preclinical and clinical studies
demonstrating that radiation combined with vaccine elicits
greater anti-tumor T-cell responses and/or reduction in
tumor burden than either modality alone [11].
Calreticulin is a critical regulator of calcium
homeostasis and a chaperone that assists in the folding
of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Calreticulin is also
an important component of the peptide-loading complex,
where it plays a key role in assuring the export of properly
loaded MHC I molecules [15]. When calreticulin is
deficient, the majority of MHC I molecules are loaded
with suboptimal peptides [15, 37]. Importantly, calreticulin
maintains the low peptide threshold required for efficient
antigen presentation [37]. Emerging data describe the role
of calreticulin expressed on the surface of cells undergoing
ICD, where it acts as a phagocytic signal for dendritic cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[38, 39].
Given that calreticulin expression was observed in
cells treated in vitro and in vivo with sublethal doses of
radiation (Figs. 3 and 4), and that calreticulin is critical
for the enrichment of endogenous peptides in the ER
and thus for efficient antigen presentation [37], we
next investigated the role of this chaperone in IM. The
presence of calreticulin on the tumor-cell surface requires
PERK-mediated phosphorylation of the translation
initiation factor eIF2a [40, 41]. Knockdown of PERK
abrogated the translocation of calreticulin to the cell
surface (Supplemental Fig. 1) and significantly reduced
irradiated tumor cells’ sensitivity to CTL lysis (Fig.
5B). As expected, abrogation of cell-surface expression
(Supplemental Fig. 1) and decrease in total protein levels
following siRNA knockdown of calreticulin (Fig. 5A)
significantly inhibited CTL lysis of tumor cells exposed to
sublethal radiation. These data concur with those of Garg
et al., who reported that PERK silencing abrogated the
ability of calreticulin to translocate to the cell surface of
murine tumor cells undergoing ICD [42]. Our data (Fig.
5C) suggest that the increased CTL lysis of tumor targets
exposed to radiation is a result of the direct interaction of
exposed calreticulin with CTLs, as the augmented CTL
killing was abrogated in the presence of a calreticulin
blocking peptide (Fig. 5C). Moreover, CTL lysis increased
when exogenous calreticulin was added to non-irradiated
tumor cells, and increased even further when exogenous
calreticulin was added to irradiated tumor cells (Fig. 5D).
These findings confirm and extend previous observations
that while docetaxel failed to induce ICD in various human
carcinoma cell lines, it did promote calreticulin exposure
in cells treated with sublethal doses, resulting in increased
CTL lysis. This contrasts with the role of calreticulin in
ICD, where calreticulin exposure is not sufficient to elicit
antitumor responses [41]. The specific molecules involved
in calreticulin/T-cell interaction have not been definitively
identified, but there are several potential candidates,
including scavenger receptor A, CD69, low-density
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1, CD91), and
perforin [23, 38, 39, 43].
Conditions of cellular stress, such as protein
misfolding, that interfere with ER homeostasis are
collectively referred to as ER stress. Mounting evidence
suggests that calreticulin exposure in tumor cells can occur
under multiple circumstances as a result of ER stress [1,
23-25]. Exposure of calreticulin has been observed in
a variety of primary human cancer cells, in tumor cells
subjected to mild disruption of calcium homeostasis, and
in pre-apoptotic cancer cells undergoing ICD [1, 24, 25].
ER stress induces the evolutionarily conserved quality
control mechanism known as UPR, which attempts to
restore ER homeostasis through a cascade of molecular
events, including transient arrest of protein translation and
upregulation of ER protein chaperones. If this restoration
fails, cells die. Here (Fig. 6B) we report that radiation
411

induces ER stress in human carcinoma cells, triggering a
survival response, which encompasses the PERK branch
of the UPR, resulting in increased expression of multiple
APM components and other immune-relevant proteins,
consistent with observations with the ER-stress inducer
thapsigargin (Figs. 3-4, Supplemental Table 1). Further,
our observations (Figs. 5-6) also strongly suggest that IM
and the consequent increased tumor sensitivity to CTL
lysis are a result of this survival response orchestrated in
reaction to radiation-induced ER stress. However, other
mechanisms and/or branches of the UPR other than PERK
may be induced by radiation to promote the observed
effects, including the calreticulin role in CTL lysis.
This study provides evidence of a novel mechanism
whereby RT induces a continuum of immunogenic
alterations in tumor biology, ranging from IM to ICD. We
expand the concept of IM to include tumor cells recovering
from radiation-induced stress subsequently becoming
more sensitive to CTL killing. These observations provide
a rationale for the use of radiation in combination with
immunotherapy, including for patients who have failed RT
or who have limited treatment options.

Diego, CA) exclusion. Supernatants were analyzed for
high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and ATP contents
72 h after irradiation, as previously described [17].
Mitoxantrone (1 µM, NDC 61703-343-65; Hospira, Lake
Forest, IL) was used as a positive control for cell death and
secretion of HMGB1 and ATP.

Proteins, peptides, and chemicals
Human recombinant calreticulin was obtained from
Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY), human serum
albumin and thapsigargin from Sigma (St. Louis, MO),
and calreticulin blocking peptide from MBL International
(Woburn, MA). The lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
peptide LCMV NP118-132 [RPQASGVYMGNLTAQ] was
obtained from CPC Scientific (Sunnyvale, CA).

CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lines
CEA-specific CTLs recognize the CEA peptide
epitope YLSGANLNL (CAP-1) [44, 45]. Prostate-specific
antigen (PSA)-specific CTLs recognize the PSA peptide
epitope VLSNDVCAQV [46]. The MUC-1-specific CD8+
CTL line, designated MUC-1 CTL, recognizes the MUC1 peptide epitope ALWGQDVTSV [46]. Brachyuryspecific CTLs recognize the brachyury peptide epitope
WLLPGTSTL (T-p2) [47]. All T-cell lines were HLA-A2restricted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor-cell lines
Cells of human breast carcinoma [MDA-MB-231
(ATCC® HTB-26 TM)], lung carcinoma [NCI-H522
(ATCC® CRL-5810 TM)], and prostate carcinoma [LNCaP
clone FGC (ATCC® CRL-1740 TM)] were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA) and cultured in medium designated by the provider
for propagation and maintenance.

Cytotoxicity assays
CTLs were used as previously described [17].
Tumor cells were mock irradiated (0 Gy) or exposed
to 10 Gy in a single dose or in daily fractions of 2 Gy
for 5 days. At 72 h post-irradiation, adherent cells were
used as targets in a standard cytotoxicity assay using
111
In [6, 21]. For indicated experiments, carcinoma cells
were used as CTL targets 48 h post-exposure to 0 Gy, 10
Gy, thapsigargin (0.25 µM/1 h) or DMSO control. For
indicated experiments, the CTL assay was performed
in the presence of anti-HLA-A2 mAb (20 mg/mL; AbD
Serotec, Raleigh, NC) or isotype control mAb (IgG2b, 20
mg/mL; AbD Serotec), exogenous calreticulin (9 nM, MW
= 55 kDa) or control human serum albumin (MW = 65
kDa), calreticulin blocking peptide (1.7 µM, 1.43 kDa) or
control LCMV118-132 peptide (MW = 1.59 kDa).

Tumor irradiation
Adherent tumor cells in log-growth phase were
placed on ice and mock-irradiated or irradiated by a
137
Cs source (Gammacell-1000, AECL/Nordion; Kanata,
Ontario, Canada) at a dose rate of 5.56 Gy/min. Cells were
then washed in fresh medium and incubated at 37°C with
5% CO2.

Analysis of cell growth and cardinal signs of
immunogenic cell death

Flow cytometry analysis
Tumor cells exposed to 0, 10, or 100 Gy were
incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days. Cells were
harvested daily and viable cells were counted by trypan
blue exclusion using a Cellometer Auto T4 automated cell
counter (Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA). Cellular
viability was confirmed by 7-AAD (BD Biosciences, San
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell-surface and intracytoplasmic staining was
performed as previously described [48]. For indicated
experiments, carcinoma cells were examined 48 h or 72
h post-exposure to 0 Gy, 10 Gy, thapsigargin (0.2 µM/1
h) or DMSO control. Surface staining of tumor cells
412

was performed using the primary labeled monoclonal
antibodies HLA-A2-FITC, ICAM-1 (CD54)-PE,
CEA (CD66)-FITC, MUC-1 (CD227)-FITC, and the
appropriate isotype-matched controls (BD Biosciences).
Anti-calreticulin-PE and matched isotype control antibody
were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).
For intracellular analysis of APM components, mouse
IgG1 (MK2-23) isotype control, LMP2 (SY-1)-, LMP7
(HB2)-, LMP10 (TO-7)-, TAP-1 (NOB1)-, TAP-2
(NOB2)-, calnexin (TO-5)-, and tapasin (TO-3)-specific
monoclonal antibodies were developed and characterized
as described [49-51]. Cellular fluorescence of 3×104 cells
was examined on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Proteins were
scored as markedly upregulated if detection levels and/
or mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) increased ≥ 30%
following treatment and were not observed in control cells
vs. isotype controls.

rinsed and counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were
digitally scanned by an Aperio ScanScope CS scanning
system and, with the exclusion of necrotic regions,
analyzed by Aperio ImageScope Viewer software (Aperio
Technologies Inc., Vista, CA). Positive tumor regions were
measured using the Positive Pixel Count v9 algorithm, as
previously described [17]. All antibodies were purchased
commercially and validated using adequate positive
controls. Negative controls included omission of primary
antibody with PBS and matched rabbit isotype antibody.

Statistical analysis
Significant differences between multiple treatment
groups were determined by 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
comparison, based on a confidence interval of 95%
using Prism 5.0d software (GraphPad Software Inc., La
Jolla, CA). Alternatively, statistical differences between
2 treatments were analyzed by unpaired Student’s t test
with a 2-tailed distribution, unless reported otherwise,
and reported as P values. Significant differences in
the distribution of flow cytometry analysis data were
determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test using
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Calreticulin and PERK siRNA knockdown and
Western blots
Silencer® siRNA and negative control siRNA
were used to silence calreticulin and PERK in tumor
cells, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). For selected
experiments, cells were irradiated with 0 or 10 Gy 24 h
after being exposed to siRNA and used as CTL targets
48 h later. For protein blotting, tumor cells were lysed in
RIPA buffer modified with 1 mM PMSF (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA) 48 h after gene knockdown.
Proteins (20-40 µg) were resolved using 4%–12% Trisglycine SDS-PAGE (Life Technologies) then transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies specific
for PERK, calreticulin, BiP, eIF2a, phospho-eIF2a
(Ser51), and beta-actin were acquired from Cell Signaling
Technology. Blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IRDye
secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln,
NE), and detection was performed with the Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biotechnology). Band
density was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD), and all protein levels were normalized
to beta-actin. Phospho-eIF2a (Ser51) protein levels were
further normalized to total eIF2a levels.
