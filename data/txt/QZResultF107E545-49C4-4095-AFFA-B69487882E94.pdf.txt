Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment: From Understanding
Pathways to Effective Clinical Trials
Hua Fang1,4 and Yves A. DeClerck1,2,3

Abstract
It is clear that tumor cells do not act alone but in close interaction with the extracellular matrix and with
stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As our understanding of tumor cell–stroma interactions
increased over the last two decades, signiﬁcant efforts have been made to develop agents that interfere
with these interactions. Here, we discuss four different therapeutic strategies that target the TME, focusing
on agents that are at the most advanced stage of preclinical or clinical development. We end this review
by outlining some of the lessons we have learned so far from the development of TME-targeting agents.

Introduction
During the second half of the 20th century, much of our focus
in cancer biology and therapy has been on genetic and epigenetic alterations in malignant cells that are drivers in the
malignant process (1). However, it is now quite clear that
tumor cells do not act alone but in close interaction with the
extracellular matrix (ECM) and with nongenetically altered
stromal cells that constitute the tumor microenvironment
(TME; ref. 2)—thus, tumors are in fact "malignant organs."
The interactions between tumor cells and the TME have a deep
inﬂuence on cancer progression and contribute to almost all of
the hallmarks of cancer (3).
The stromal cells that interact with tumor cells not only
originate from neighboring tissues but can also be actively
recruited from the bone marrow as endothelial progenitor
cells, myeloid and lymphoid inﬂammatory cells, and mesenchymal cells. Once in the TME, they become "educated" as
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), tumor- (or cancer-)
associated ﬁbroblasts (TAF or CAF), or vascular and perivascular cells. Education of stromal cells is also a dynamic process
where nonmalignant cells progressively switch from a neutral
or antitumorigenic role toward a protumorigenic role. When
these cells are targeted by therapies, it is therefore critical to
take into consideration the speciﬁc stage at which they are in
such an education process.
The mechanisms of communication between tumor cells
and the TME are complex but fall into two main categories,

contact-dependent mechanisms that involve cell–cell and
cell–ECM adhesion molecules and contact-independent
mechanisms in which soluble molecules such as growth
factors, chemokines and cytokines, and soluble subcellular
organelles including microvesicles and exosomes play an
essential role. Ultimately, these interactions activate via
juxtacrine and paracrine mechanisms, signaling pathways
in malignant cells and in nonmalignant stromal cells that
can inhibit or favor tumor progression (4). As our understanding of tumor cell–stroma interactions has increased
and pathways involved have been better characterized,
signiﬁcant efforts have been made over the last decade to
identify, develop, and test therapeutic agents interfering
either with the recruitment of stromal cells into the TME,
with tumor cell–stromal interaction, or with speciﬁc pathways activated by the TME.
In this review, we will discuss four different therapeutic
strategies that primarily target the TME, focusing on agents
that are at the most advanced preclinical or clinical stages of
development (Table 1). Agents that speciﬁcally target the
immune system and are used for immunotherapy are not
discussed here as they have been the subject of recent
comprehensive reviews (5, 6).

Strategy 1: Targeting the Tumor Vasculature
The vascularization of a tumor is an intricate process that is
tightly regulated by pro- and antiangiogenic factors produced
by both malignant cells and nonmalignant cells through autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways. The onset of angiogenesis, known as "angiogenic switch," is induced when the
proangiogenic factors are favored (7). VEGF/VEGF-A is the
predominant proangiogenic factor involved in endothelial cell
activation (8), but many other growth factors are also proangiogenic, such as ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF), plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), and EGF (7). Different from
the normal vasculature characterized by an organized formation of mature endothelial cell covered with pericytes, the
tumor vasculature is typically abnormal with a deﬁcit in

pericytes and perivascular cells, and an increased permeability,
resulting in a leaky vascular system (9). It is also now well
recognized that bone marrow–derived endothelial progenitor
cells contribute to the tumor vasculature through a process
known as vasculogenesis (10).
Targeting VEGF signaling
Considering the important functions of VEGF signaling in
tumor angiogenesis, growth, invasion, and metastasis, several VEGF- and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-antagonists have
been developed. The ﬁrst effective agent, which is also the
ﬁrst one to provide clinical evidence supporting the validity
of the concept of targeting the TME, is bevacizumab (Avastin). This recombinant humanized VEGF-neutralizing
monoclonal antibody (mAb) was approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for the treatment of
metastatic colon cancer and subsequently several other
metastatic cancers in combination with cytotoxic therapies.
Other effective inhibitors of VEGF signaling include smallmolecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; e.g., sunitinib/Sutent, sorafenib/Nexavar, and pazopanib/Votrient)
and receptor-speciﬁc antibodies (e.g., IMC-1121B/Ramucirumab, a mAb against VEGFR-2). Sunitinib, sorafenib, and
pazopanib have already been approved by the FDA, in most
cases for advanced renal cell carcinoma. This type of cancer
is not only highly angiogenic but its tumor angiogenesis is
also predominantly driven by VEGF, which explains why four
different VEGF-pathway–targeting drugs have all been
approved for this type of malignancy (11). IMC-1121B/Ramacurimab has shown a favorable therapeutic index with early
evidence of both stable disease and partial responses in a
phase I trial of patients with advanced solid tumors (12) and
is currently undergoing several phase III clinical trials in
patients with breast and gastric cancer, but its efﬁcacy has
not yet been shown.
Beyond targeting VEGF signaling
Highlighting the need to develop more effective antiangiogenic agents was the recent decision by the FDA to withdraw
Avastin from its previously approved indication for patients
with metastatic HER2–negative breast cancer due to reports
that Avastin had no favorable therapeutic efﬁcacy and significant toxicity (bleeding, heart attack or heart failure, elevated
blood pressure, and organ perforation; ref. 13). This again
emphasizes the fact that we should not assume VEGF-dependent angiogenesis to be present in all cancer types at the same
level as in renal cell carcinoma. For example, the results of an
analysis of a large number of primary breast cancer specimens
from various types of disease progression that identiﬁed six
different proangiogenic growth factors, including VEGF and
FGF, indicated that there was a greater level of proangiogenic
growth factor redundancy in more advanced disease stage (14).
This type of angiogenic pathway redundancy is now well
accepted as the major resistance mechanism for VEGF-pathway–targeting agents (15–17).
Thus, multiple antiangiogenic agents targeting other
proangiogenic signaling pathways are currently undergoing
development.

Targeting FGF signaling
Emerging evidence suggests that the upregulation of FGF
provides a mechanism of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. The
most advanced FGF/FGFR–targeting agent so far developed is
BMS-582664 (brivanib), an oral dual inhibitor of VEGFR and
FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases, presently tested in
multiple phase II/III clinical trials (18). In a recent phase II
open-label study in patients with advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma who had failed prior antiangiogenic treatment with
sorafenib, brivanib has shown promising antitumor activity
with a manageable safety proﬁle (19).
Targeting PDGF signaling
PDGF and its receptors PDGFR have been detected in
diverse human cancers, and PDGFR is upregulated in the
tumor vasculature, particularly in pericytes, where it plays a
central role in their proliferation, migration, and maturation
(20). PDGF signaling also regulates angiogenesis by inducing
VEGF expression and by recruiting pericytes to mature blood
vessels (21). SU6668, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor for
PDGFR, VEGFR, and FGFR, has currently completed phase I
clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors. The
results of this trial, however, have shown relatively low plasma
levels of the free drug because of its high protein binding,
discouraging further clinical development (22).
Targeting EGFR signaling
EGF receptor (EGFR) is a member of the HER growth factor
receptor family, a group of homologous receptor tyrosine
kinases known to modulate normal cell growth and differentiation (23). In solid tumors, VEGF and EGFR pathways are
linked, thus promoting angiogenesis (24), and resistance to
anti-EGFR therapy is accompanied by an increase in VEGF
levels (25). Because tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cell both express EGFR, targeting EGFR has a dual
function of inhibiting both tumor cells and endothelial cell.
Several EGFR-neutralizing antibodies (e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab, etc.) and small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., erlotinib,
geﬁtinib, etc.) have been approved by the FDA and have been
incorporated into the standard care for different types of
cancers, implying the signiﬁcance of targeting both tumor
cells and TME in cancer therapy.

Strategy 2: Targeting Cancer-Associated
Inﬂammation
The presence of innate and adaptive immune cells in tumors
was initially considered to be the sign of an effective attack of
the immune system against cancer. It is now well recognized
that immune cells can also promote cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis (26). Our understanding of this dual
role of immune cells in cancer progression is centered on the
concept of polarization. Immune cells can be polarized toward
either a typically antitumorigenic T-helper cell type 1 (TH1)driven process or toward a TH2-driven process that is protumorigenic (27). The polarization of the immune system is
characterized by changes in metabolic pathways and the
production of cytokines by immune cells. TAMs, which can

Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment

be polarized toward a TH2-type, have emerged as being among
the most important players in a protumorigenic inﬂammatory
reaction. Their contribution to cancer angiogenesis, cancer
metastasis, and drug resistance is now well recognized (28). As
a result, strategies to inhibit their protumorigenic activity have
been actively pursued and two major strategies aimed at
targeting TAM and targeting the protumorigenic inﬂammatory pathways have been developed so far.
Inhibiting TAM
The recruitment of macrophages by tumors is driven by
chemokines such as chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2),
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and colonystimulating factor-1 (CSF-1; ref. 29), and these factors also
promote the polarization of macrophages toward a TH2-type
(also reported as M2). Targeting these chemokines has thus
been actively tested in cancer therapy. CNTO 888, a neutralizing antibody to human CCL2, has proven to have anticancer
activity in a preclinical model of prostate cancer (30). Bindarit,
a small-molecule inhibitor of CCL2, was recently shown to
have anticancer activity in preclinical models of prostate and
breast cancer, causing a signiﬁcant decrease in the inﬁltration
of TAM and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in tumors (31).
Other studies have shown that anti-CSF-1 antibodies and
antisense oligonucleotides suppress macrophage inﬁltration
and the growth of xenografted mammary tumors in mice
(32, 33). TKIs of CSF-1 receptor (also known as c-fms), Ki20227
and JNJ-28312141, suppress osteolysis in a bone metastasis
mouse model (34) and inhibit angiogenesis and bone metastasis in preclinical models of solid tumors and acute myeloid
leukemia, respectively (35). These favorable preclinical results
support their further clinical development.
Inhibiting inﬂammatory pathways
Numerous signaling pathways become activated upon interaction between tumor cells and immune stromal cells. Inhibitors for several of these pathways have been developed.
Targeting IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway
Because of its central role in cancer-associated inﬂammation and other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus,
the interleukin (IL)-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway has been
the focus of much attention over the last several years (36).
Strategies to inhibit this pathway have focused on (i) blocking
IL-6/IL-6 receptor (IL-6/IL-6R) interaction, (ii) blocking Janusactivated kinase (JAK) phosphorylation of STAT3, and (iii)
inhibiting STAT3 DNA-binding activity.
An IL-6–neutralizing mAb (siltuximab/CNTO-328) is being
tested in a number of phase I/II clinical trials. When given in
combination with mitoxantrone and prednisone in patients
with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, siltuximab was found to be of no additional beneﬁt (37). However, it
has been shown to stabilize disease and induce partial
responses in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
(38) and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (39). Further studies
will be needed to show its clinical efﬁcacy. Ruxolitinib
(INCB018424), a JAK2-speciﬁc inhibitor, is currently being
tested in a phase III clinical trial in patients with myeloﬁbrosis

www.aacrjournals.org

(40) and in phase II clinical trials in adults and children with a
variety of cancers. A STAT3 transcription factor decoy that
inhibits STAT3 DNA binding was tested in a phase 0 (biologic
effect) clinical trial, in head and neck tumors, and shown to
bind with high afﬁnity to STAT3 protein, to reduce cellular
viability, and to suppress STAT3-dependent gene expression in
tumor cells (41).
Targeting NF-kB signaling pathway
NF-kB is a family of transcriptional factors that play pivotal
roles in both inﬂammation-induced tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity (42, 43). NF-kB signaling is also critical in
bone metastasis, being activated in osteoclasts upon stimulation of the receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK) by its ligand
RANKL produced by tumor cells and by osteoblasts (44).
Activation of most forms of NF-kB depends on phosphorylation-induced ubiquitination of the inhibitor of kB (IkB) proteins, which is modulated by the inhibitor of IkB kinase (IKK)
complex (45).
To date, most efforts in targeting NF-kB signaling have
concentrated on the development of speciﬁc inhibitors for the
IKKb subunit (46). PS-1145, a small-molecule inhibitor of IKKb,
was found to be effective in subtypes of diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas where NF-kB is activated (47). Because IKKb has
many NF-kB–independent functions, including the induction
of genes involved in autophagy, the alteration of actin dynamics, and the regulation of the phosphorylation of multiple
proteins, its inhibition has resulted in undesired effects (45).
Other approaches that target NF-kB include (i) the inhibition
of proteasomes to disrupt the degradation of IkB, by agents
such as bortezomib (Velcade) used in multiple myeloma (48),
and (ii) the direct targeting of NF-kB–dependent gene expression with agents such as curcumin and arsenic.
Targeting TNF-a signaling pathway
In animal models, TNF-a at high doses has a potent anticancer activity through stimulation of T-cell–mediated immunity and the destruction of blood vessels (49). Conversely, at
physiologic doses, TNF-a enhances tumor growth and metastasis by inducing the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines
and chemokines (e.g., IL-6), proangiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF,
FGF, etc.), and proteases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases or
MMP; refs. 49, 50). TNF inhibition could thus have a dual effect.
At least two TNF-a antagonists have been tested in patients with advanced cancers. The ﬁrst antagonist, etanercept
(Enbrel), a recombinant humanized soluble p75 TNFa–trapping receptor that binds to TNF-a, has been tested in
several phase I/II clinical trials. Etanercept in combination
with rituximab (a mAb against B cells) was well tolerated and
produced durable remissions in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (51). When used as a single agent in patients
with recurrent ovarian cancer, it resulted in disease stabilization and some partial responses (52). It has also shown safety
and biologic activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer
(53). The second TNF-a antagonist, inﬂiximab (cA2, Remicade), a chimeric human-mouse mAb, has been shown to
produce stable disease or partial responses as a single agent
in renal cell carcinoma (54). It did not provide additional

Fang and DeClerck

therapeutic beneﬁts when combined with sorafenib in patients
with advanced renal cell carcinoma (55).
Targeting COX2 signaling pathway
Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), an inducible enzyme responsible
for the synthesis of prostanoids (prostaglandins, prostacyclin,
and thromboxane) from the precursor arachidonic acid, is
another major player in inﬂammation. COX2 overexpression is
observed in both cancer cells and stromal cells during tumor
progression and in response to anticancer therapies. Elevated
levels of COX2 in tumors are associated with increased angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and tumor cell resistance to apoptosis
(56, 57).
Celecoxib, a COX2 inhibitor, has shown efﬁcacy in preventing colon cancer in patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease,
but was not adopted clinically due to its unacceptable cardiac
toxicity (58). The therapeutic administration of celecoxib has
been tested in a number of phase II/III clinical trials for
multiple cancers with mixed clinical results. Although it has
improved the efﬁcacy of conventional therapy in patients with
locally advanced undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(59), it had no effect in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (60)
or advanced non–small cell lung cancer (61). Its value as a
therapeutic agent is uncertain at this point.
The side effects of COX2 inhibitors may result from the
suppression of prostanoid production, including the protumorigenic PGE2. A possible way to selectively block PGE2 is to
inhibit prostaglandin E synthase (PGES; ref. 62). Selective
inhibitors of this enzyme, which is overexpressed in cancer
cells (63), may rationally be proposed in substitution for COX
inhibitors. Another arachidonic acid–metabolizing enzyme, 5lipoxygenase (5-LOX), also plays an important role in inﬂammation and inﬂammation-associated carcinogenesis and is
overexpressed in many cancers. As a result, 5-LOX inhibitors
have been developed. It was recently shown that the combination of zileuton (a speciﬁc 5-LOX inhibitor) and celecoxib
prevented oral carcinogenesis through their joint inhibitory
effects on arachidonic acid metabolism (64). Moreover, simultaneous treatment of premalignant and malignant human lung
cell lines with a triple combination of one COX2 inhibitor
(celecoxib) and two speciﬁc 5-LOX inhibitors, MK886 and
REV5901, is more potent in suppressing growth and inducing
cell death than a single or dual combination of these agents
(65). Further clinical tests are however necessary to conﬁrm
the clinical effectiveness and safety of COX/LOX dual
inhibitors.
Targeting TGF-b signaling pathway
TGF-b has a dual function in cancer. It is tumor suppressive
in premalignant cells and at the early stage of cancer development, but strongly protumorigenic at later stages of cancer
progression (66). Autocrine TGF-b signaling promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (EMT), which increases cell
invasion and metastasis. Paracrine TGF-b signaling stimulates
angiogenesis and contributes to an immune-tolerant environment by suppressing T lymphocytes and natural killer cells
(67). TGF-b also has a central function in bone metastasis. It is
released from the bone matrix during bone resorption by

4968

Cancer Res; 73(16) August 15, 2013

osteoclasts and contributes to a vicious circle that further
fuels tumor growth and bone destruction (44, 68). Strategies to
inhibit TGF-b activity include (69): (i) blocking the production
of TGF-b with antisense molecules, (ii) blocking the activity of
TGF-b with neutralizing antibodies, (iii) blocking the interaction between TGF-b and its receptors (TGF-bR) with soluble
forms of TGF-bRs, and (iv) blocking TGF-b–mediated receptor
signaling by small-molecule TKIs of TGF-bRII and TGF-bRIII.
AP12009 (trabedersen), an 18-oligomer antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide that prevents the production of
TGF-b2, is at the most advanced stage of development. On the
basis of data showing that TGF-b2 is overexpressed in more
than 90% of high-grade gliomas, and that its levels are closely
related to tumor progression, AP12009 was ﬁrst tested in
patients with high-grade glioma and showed an increase in
6 month median survival from 21.7 to 39.1 months (70, 71).
Furthermore, inhibition of TGF-b2 in tumor tissue leads to
reversal of tumor-induced immune suppression as well as
inhibition of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (72). In
a phase II clinical trial for patients with brain tumors, the
addition of AP12009 to conventional chemotherapy resulted
in a signiﬁcant increase in 14-month tumor control rate in
patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and an increase in 2- and
3-year survival in a subgroup of patients with high-grade
glioma (73).

Strategy 3: Targeting the Communication
between Tumor Cells and TME
Targeting communication between tumor cells and ECM
Integrins are clustered at the cell surface in complexes
known as focal adhesions, and play a central role in many
normal physiologic processes such as growth, anchoragedependent differentiation, adhesion, motility, apoptosis, and
angiogenesis (74, 75). They are expressed by endothelial cell
where they control angiogenesis and by tumor cells where they
potentiate tumor metastasis by facilitating migration, survival,
and invasion. Integrin inhibition can thus affect both tumor
cells and endothelial cell.
Cilengitide (EMD 121974), a cyclic RGD (arginine–glycine–
aspartic acid) pentapeptide, was the ﬁrst potent integrin
inhibitor for both avb3 and avb5 that reached clinical testing
(76). In a phase II trial for patients with recurrent glioblastoma
multiforme (77), cilengitide monotherapy was found to be well
tolerated but exhibited modest antitumor activity. Intetumumab, (CNTO 95), a mAb against the human av integrin, has
shown a favorable safety proﬁle and a trend toward improved
overall survival in a phase II clinical trial of patients with
metastatic melanoma (78). In contrast, in another phase II trial
of patients with stage IV melanoma, etaracizumab (MEDI-522),
a mAb against the human avb3 integrin, did not provide any
therapeutic beneﬁt (79). Whether these inhibitors should be
used alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents
remains to be determined.
Targeting communication between tumor cells and the
bone microenvironment
The bone is among the most common metastatic sites in
many different types of cancer, and the mechanisms involved

Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment

in bone metastasis have been well characterized (80). Tumor
cells secrete parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP),
which promotes the expression of RANKL at the surface of
osteoblasts. By binding to its receptor RANK present on
osteoclast precursor cells, RANKL promotes their differentiation into mature osteoclasts and their activation. RANKL is
inhibited by a natural inhibitor, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Osteoclasts, PTHrP, and RANKL have thus been considered as
therapeutic targets.
Targeting osteoclasts with bisphosphonates has been
among the ﬁrst successful strategies targeting the TME in
cancer bone metastasis. Zoledronic acid, a nitrogen-binding
bisphosphonate, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients
with multiple myeloma and documented bone metastases
from solid tumors, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic
therapy. Despite having a limited effect on overall survival, this
agent signiﬁcantly decreases the number of skeletal morbidities in these patients (81). A humanized mAb-targeting PTHrP,
CAL, has completed a phase I/II study for breast cancer with
bone metastasis but its clinical efﬁcacy has not yet been
reported. Denosumab, a fully humanized mAb that speciﬁcally
targets RANKL and was originally approved by the FDA in
postmenopausal women with risk of osteoporosis, is now
approved for patients with cancer bone metastasis and for
the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with solid
tumors (82). In 2011, the FDA also granted approval for
denosumab to increase bone mass in patients who are at high
risk of fracture from receiving androgen-deprivation therapy
for nonmetastatic prostate cancer or in patients receiving
adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.

Strategy 4: Targeting Hypoxia in the TME
A major metabolic feature of the TME is that it is hypoxic.
Tumor cells adapt to this hypoxic environment using mechanisms that promote genomic instability and deregulate DNA
repair systems and the expression of proto-oncogenes (83).
Altogether these mechanisms promote therapeutic resistance.
There is also recent evidence that hypoxia through the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a and HIF-2a regulates
the polarization of macrophages (84).
Bioreductive prodrugs
A ﬁrst therapeutic strategy that takes advantage of the
unique hypoxic environment of tumors consists of the use of
bioreductive prodrugs, which are activated by enzymatic
reduction (bioreduction) into toxic products in hypoxic tissues
(85). Among those bioreductive prodrugs was tirapazamine
that, despite promising results from preclinical studies and
early-phase clinical trials, was abandoned as it failed to show
any beneﬁt in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in several phase III trials in patients with non–small cell
lung and head and neck cancer (86). Other bioreductive
prodrugs currently being investigated in phase I/II clinical
trials include TH-302 and AQ4N, which have both shown
minimal toxicity in a phase I trial in patients with advanced
malignancies (87, 88). In contrast, others like PR-104 have
shown severe hematologic toxicities that may limit their use

www.aacrjournals.org

in the clinic (89). The future of these agents is thus uncertain
and further preclinical and clinical testing is required.
Targeting HIF-1a signaling
Multiple agents developed as HIF inhibitors are currently
being evaluated in clinical trials. Among the most advanced
ones are EZN-2968, a HIF-1a antisense mRNA, and PX-478, a
small-molecule inhibitor of HIF derived from melphalan by
oxidation of the nitrogen mustard moiety (90). Both of these
agents have completed phase I clinical testing but no data on
toxicity and efﬁcacy have been reported yet.
Targeting unfolded protein response signaling
Severe hypoxia leads to increased levels of unfolded proteins
in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to the induction of
unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR suppresses protein
synthesis, stimulates protein degradation in the endoplasmic
reticulum, and activates apoptosis or autophagy to resolve
endoplasmic reticulum stress (91). One therapeutic strategy to
target UPR signaling seeks to exacerbate endoplasmic reticulum stress to overwhelm the UPR on the assumption that it is
near capacity in hypoxic cells (91).
Agents having such action include inhibitors of 26S proteasome (such as bortezomib, nelﬁnavir, etc.) and inhibitors of
HSP90 (such as IPI-504, 17-AAG, etc.). Bortezomib has been
approved by the FDA for multiple myeloma and mantle cell
lymphoma and nelﬁnavir is still under investigation in phase I
trials. When tested in a phase II trial, IPI-504 (retaspimycin),
used as a single agent, had a minimal effect on tumor burden
and an unacceptable toxicity in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (92). In contrast, 17-AAG (tanespimycin)
had signiﬁcant anticancer efﬁcacy when combined with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast
cancer in a phase II trial (93), clearly warranting further clinical
investigation.

What Have We Learned So Far?
With more than a decade of experience using drugs that
more speciﬁcally target the TME, it is appropriate to ask the
question of "what we have learned?" as we continue to move
forward. Among the many lessons learned, we want to highlight three in particular in this review.
Lesson 1: targeting the TME can be toxic
As clinical studies using agents targeting the TME were
initiated, it was somewhat assumed that these agents would be
much less toxic than cytotoxic agents used in chemotherapy. It
is now clear that this is not the case as many initially promising
studies on agents targeting the TME had to be discontinued
because of unacceptable and often unanticipated toxicity. The
reasons are multiple and complex.
The ﬁrst and most obvious reason is that many agents
targeting the TME alter the homeostatic balance in normal
organs and tissues, as was well illustrated in the case of smallmolecule inhibitors of MMPs. Cell and ECM proteins in tissues
are not static but are subject to a constant and dynamic
turnover that requires a delicate balance between growth and

death, synthesis and degradation, and activation and inhibition of speciﬁc proteolytic processes or pathways. By disturbing the balance between MMP activation and inhibition,
inhibitors of MMPs were found to increase collagen deposition
in tissues and to cause musculoskeletal pain and inﬂammation
that although reversible, necessitated stopping their use in one
third of the patients (94). Similarly, the use of Avastin in clinical
trials has been associated with signiﬁcant toxicities, in particular hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolism, and
congestive heart failure, caused in part by a decrease in nitric
oxide (NO) production associated with vasoconstriction and a
lack of vascular integrity causing proteinuria, hemorrhage, and
thrombosis. As previously discussed, these side effects have
resulted in the FDA's decision to remove Avastin from previous
approval in breast cancer (95). In contrast, one would have
anticipated that inhibition of proteasomes by drugs such as
bortezomib would be associated with major toxicities, considering the central role the proteasome complex is playing in
degradation of ubiquinated proteins. Somewhat surprisingly
this drug, which has been tested in more than 200 clinical trials,
is relatively well tolerated and has controllable toxicity, primarily neuropathy and thrombocytopenia (96).
A second reason is that agents targeting the TME often
target cells or pathways that are not always the enemy of
cancer cells. This is again well illustrated in the case of
MMP inhibitors, which were found to inhibit not only MMPs
used by tumor cells for invasion but also MMPs involved
in the production of antiangiogenic peptides by cleavage
of precursor proteins (94). Similarly, targeting NF-kB or
TGF-b can have signiﬁcant side effects as these pathways,
depending on the state of tumor progression, can either
promote or inhibit tumor growth. As agents targeting inﬂammation trail behind antiangiogenic therapies in clinical
development, it will be important to remember the lessons
learned from the testing of MMP and angiogenesis inhibitors
and to consider the role of these agents within the dynamic
context of an immune system that can be pro- as well as
antitumorigenic.

Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment

Lesson 2: targeting the TME does not prevent resistance
Because agents targeting the TME are affecting nonmalignant cells, it was initially assumed that—in contrast to
their malignant counterparts—they would not be subjected
to genomic instability, and that the acquisition of resistance
would not be a signiﬁcant problem. This, however, has not
been the case as we have seen with Avastin. On the basis of a
systems biology approach, it could in fact be predicted that
the redundancy of angiogenic signals might limit the efﬁcacy
of antiangiogenic monotherapies (97). In support of this
idea, it has been recently shown that tumors become refractory or even evade the inhibition of a single proangiogenic
pathway like VEGF by upregulating compensatory angiogenic factors or other pathways that are favorable to tumor
cells (16, 98). Another important consideration is that drugs
that target the TME often target pathways activated not only
in nonmalignant cells but also in malignant cells, which are
prone to become intrinsically drug-resistant or to activate
by-pass mechanisms.

Lesson 3: targeting the TME requires knowing the
optimal biologic dose
Somewhat unfortunately, agents targeting the TME have
been tested in clinical trials often at their maximal-tolerated
dose (MTD), which has been the strategy for chemotherapy
trials where it is often assumed that more is better. However,
this may not be the case when targeting the TME. One of the
objectives in targeting the TME is in fact to reestablish a
disrupted homeostasis in a "malignant organ" rather than to
ﬂip the balance in an entirely opposite direction by "overhitting" the target at MTD. The complex relationship between
the ECM and tumor cells illustrates this latter point well.
Determining the optimal biologic dose of TME-targeting
agents may thus be more important than ﬁnding their MTD.
This requires that: (i) the drug hits the target, (ii) the target is
altered by the drug, (iii) the tumor is altered by hitting the
target, and (iv) giving a higher dose fails to improve outcomes
further (99). It will therefore be critical to develop "companion"
biomarkers that can serve as indicators of the effect of agents
targeting the TME. Sensitive functional imaging techniques
and molecular markers such as cytokines, chemokines proﬁles,
immunometrics, and immunoscore (6) are likely to play an
important role in our evaluation of clinical trials targeting
the TME.

Conclusions
It has now been almost 10 years since the FDA's approval of
Avastin as the ﬁrst drug speciﬁcally targeting the TME in cancer.
Since this milestone, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in
the preclinical development and clinical testing of agents that
target the TME. Several of them are already part of the standard
treatment in patients with speciﬁc cancers, whereas others are
still at the early stages of clinical testing. So far, strategies
targeting the tumor vasculature seem to be the most successful,
as shown by the large number of agents approved by the
FDA. Strategies inhibiting the protumorigenic inﬂammatory
response of the TME are rapidly being developed with agents
either targeting TAM and their recruitment or protumorigenic
inﬂammatory pathways activated in tumor cells and stromal
cells. Inhibition of tumor cell–stroma interactions is another
strategy where new agents are also rapidly emerging.
As more agents targeting the TME are proposed for clinical
trials, it is important to remember that there are several
questions in regard to their activity and place in our therapeutic arsenal against cancer that remain to be answered. One,

for example, is whether these agents are most effective when
used alone or in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other molecular-targeted therapy. Recent data suggest
that the TME is an important contributor to therapeutic
resistance (100). Thus combining agents targeting the TME
with chemotherapeutic agents to prevent the emergence of
minimal residual disease from drug-resistant tumor cells may
be critical. If those TME-targeting agents are used in combination with myeloablative agents, it will be important to
determine whether some agents such as those inhibiting the
recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells should be speciﬁcally used between courses of intensive and myelosuppressive
therapy to prevent the release of precursor cells into the blood
circulation (101). Another question is whether some agents
would be more effective at early stages on cancer progression
and others at later stages (i.e., TGF-b inhibitors), considering
the dynamic changes in the pro- or antitumorigenic functions
of the TME during cancer progression. As discussed earlier, the
question of the development of resistance to agents targeting
the TME remains an important consideration.
As we are rapidly entering the era of precision cancer
treatment and are using a genomic and biomarker-integrated
approach to determine the best ﬁrst-line therapies for patients
with cancer, it will be equally important to develop reliable
biomarkers that indicate the type of TME present in a speciﬁc
tumor. For example, precise molecular or cellular information
on the nature of immune cells present in a speciﬁc tumor and
on their polarization could be as critical as the identiﬁcation of
the driver(s) mutation(s) that should be targeted. The development of such TME biomarkers and molecular signatures
should be an exciting and valuable research direction in the
TME over the next several years.
