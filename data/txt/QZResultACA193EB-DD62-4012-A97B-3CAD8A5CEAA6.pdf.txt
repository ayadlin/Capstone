Abstract
Obesity is associated with a worse breast cancer prognosis and elevated levels of inﬂammation, including greater
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and activity in adipose-inﬁltrating macrophages. The product of this
enzyme, the proinﬂammatory eicosanoid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), stimulates adipose tissue aromatase expression and subsequent estrogen production, which could promote breast cancer progression. This study demonstrates that daily use of a nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID), which inhibits COX-2 activity, is associated
with reduced estrogen receptor a (ERa)–positive breast cancer recurrence in obese and overweight women.
Retrospective review of data from ERa-positive patients with an average body mass index of >30 revealed
that NSAID users had a 52% lower recurrence rate and a 28-month delay in time to recurrence. To examine the
mechanisms that may be mediating this effect, we conducted in vitro studies that utilized sera from obese and
normal-weight patients with breast cancer. Exposure to sera from obese patients stimulated greater macrophage
COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. This was correlated with enhanced preadipocyte aromatase expression
following incubation in conditioned media (CM) collected from the obese-patient, sera-exposed macrophages, an
effect neutralized by COX-2 inhibition with celecoxib. In addition, CM from macrophage/preadipocyte cocultures
exposed to sera from obese patients stimulated greater breast cancer cell ERa activity, proliferation, and migration
compared with sera from normal-weight patients, and these differences were eliminated or reduced by the
addition of an aromatase inhibitor during CM generation. Prospective studies designed to examine the clinical
beneﬁt of NSAID use in obese patients with breast cancer are warranted. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4446–57. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Obesity has become a signiﬁcant global public health problem in the past 30 years (1). More than 35% of Americans have a
body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 (2), an alarming percentage given the association of obesity with an increased
incidence of, and mortality from, numerous chronic diseases,
including breast cancer. Several studies have demonstrated a
link between obesity and a worse breast cancer prognosis in
both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, including a
prospective study of almost 500,000 women that found a
progressive escalation in the risk of breast cancer mortality
with each successive increase in BMI category (3). Other
studies have established positive correlations between obesity

and breast cancer recurrence (4), a shorter disease-free survival
and lower rates of overall survival, independent of tumor stage
at diagnosis (5–7).
Obesity is hypothesized to affect outcomes in postmenopausal, hormone-responsive patients with breast cancer negatively
by promoting adipose tissue expression of aromatase, the ratelimiting enzyme in estradiol production. This theory has been
supported by the results of clinical studies with anastrazole and
letrozole showing a reduction in the efﬁcacy of these aromatase
inhibitors with increasing BMI (8, 9). Plasma estradiol and
estrone sulfate levels in obese patients remain signiﬁcantly
elevated in comparison to nonobese patients following letrozole
treatment (10), indicating that this reduced response rate may
be related to suboptimal inhibition of obesity-associated aromatase activity. Given that aromatase inhibitors are prescribed
at a ﬁxed dose, it is possible that their decreased efﬁcacy in
obese women is because of underdosing. However, two phase III
clinical trials of anastrozole found that a 10-fold increase in dose
provided no additional overall beneﬁt. It is likely that these trials
included a number of obese women, suggesting that greater
dosage will not solve the problem of obesity-related aromatase
inhibitor resistance (11, 12).
Recent ﬁndings by Dannenberg and colleagues conﬁrm the
presence of elevated aromatase expression in the breast tissue
of overweight and obese women (13, 14). Crucially, they have

demonstrated high congruence between aromatase levels and
local breast tissue inﬂammation, as measured by the number
of crown-like structures (CLS-B). CLS-B are inﬂammatory
foci composed of a necrotic adipocyte surrounded by
macrophages, which produce excess amounts of several
proinﬂammatory mediators. These include cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2)–derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent stimulant
of aromatase expression in preadipocytes, the predominant
site of aromatase expression within adipose tissue (13–15).
This obesity–inﬂammation–aromatase axis may be a signiﬁcant contributor to the reduced aromatase inhibitor response
and increased mortality rate observed in obese postmenopausal patients. Collectively, these studies suggest that obese
postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor a (ERa)-positive breast cancer may beneﬁt from combining hormone
therapy with a drug targeting the COX-2 pathway.
In this study, we retrospectively examined the association
between nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID) use
and recurrence rate in a hormone-responsive breast cancer
patient population to determine whether this COX-2 pathwaytargeting drug group improves prognosis. NSAID use reduced
the recurrence rate by approximately 50% and extended
the disease-free survival by more than 2 years in our largely
overweight/obese, postmenopausal population of women.
Furthermore, to assess whether inﬂammation-associated preadipocyte aromatase expression may be responsible for this
effect, we utilized an in vitro model of the obese patient's tumor
microenvironment. Here we demonstrated that obesity-associated circulating factors enhance preadipocyte aromatase
expression and estradiol production via their stimulation of
macrophage COX-2 expression, resulting in greater breast
cancer cell ERa activity, proliferation, and migration.

Materials and Methods
Subjects
Review of medical records dated between January 1, 1987,
and January 12, 2011, from the Cancer Therapy and Research
Center (CTRC) at the University of Texas Health Science Center
at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and the START Center for Cancer
Care clinic in San Antonio, Texas, yielded a patient population
of 440 women diagnosed with invasive, ERa-positive breast
cancer. Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of carcinoma in
situ, hormone therapy refusal, or noncompliance, unavailable
treatment information, discontinuation of adjuvant therapy
because of insurance issues or health problems, diagnosis of
triple negative breast cancer, breast cancer metastasis at the
time of diagnosis, unavailable diagnosis dates, and underweight status. The collection of patient data from these medical records was approved by the Institutional Review Boards
(IRB) of UTHSCSA and START and conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients before
participation.
Study design and data collection
This exploratory study utilized retrospective data collected
from patient charts. BMI was calculated and patients classiﬁed
as normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–

www.aacrjournals.org

29.9 kg/m2), or obese (30.0 kg/m2). Perimenopausal women
were classiﬁed as premenopausal because they receive tamoxifen as their ﬁrst-line hormonal therapy (16, 17). Patients were
designated as NSAID users if progress notes described daily
use of aspirin, ibuprofen, celecoxib, naproxen, meloxicam, or
another COX-2 inhibitor in the list of medications. Information
on prediagnostic NSAID use was not available, and speciﬁc
data on postdiagnostic NSAID dosage and length of use was
not collected. Use of analgesics that do not target COX-2 as well
as pro re nata (prn) COX-2 inhibitor use did not qualify for
inclusion in the NSAID user group. Recurrence was deﬁned as
any local, contralateral, distant tumor, or metastasis of the
primary breast cancer. Second primaries were not classiﬁed as
recurrent breast cancer.
Serum samples
Serum was collected from 25 postmenopausal patients with
breast cancer under an IRB approved biorepository collection
protocol at the CTRC of UTHSCSA. The collection and use of
these biological samples was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice. Informed
consent was obtained before participation, and all samples and
data were de-identiﬁed before release to maintain patient
conﬁdentiality. Serum was pooled according to two patient
BMI categories, normal weight and obese. Serum from 5
normal-weight and 5 obese postmenopausal women, who were
ineligible control subjects in the Polish Women's Health Study,
was also utilized. The design of this study has been described
elsewhere (18). This serum was not pooled.
Cell lines and reagents
The ERa-positive MCF-7 and T47D and ERa-negative MDAMB-231 breast cancer cell lines (ATCC) were maintained in
IMEM (GIBCO Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). Preadipocytes isolated from women
undergoing elective surgical procedures were a generous gift
from Dr. Rong Li, UTHSCSA, and have been described previously (19). They were maintained in DMEM/F12 1:1 media
(GIBCO Life Technologies) plus 10% FBS. U937 monocytes
(ATCC) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS
and matured to macrophages at the time of seeding for
experimentation by incubating the cells in 10.0 ng/mL phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) for 48 hours. Testosterone,
anastrozole, celecoxib, and TPA were purchased from Sigma.
Conditioned media
Macrophage-conditioned media (CM) was generated by
seeding 4  105 U937 monocytes per well in 6-well plates,
maturing them to macrophages with TPA, then serum-starving
the cells for 6 hours. The macrophages were then exposed to 2%
pooled or individual patient sera in serum-free media (SFM) for
1 hour, the sera removed and cells washed with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) followed by incubation in SFM for 24
hours. The CM was then collected and stored at 20 C for
subsequent in vitro assays. To assess the impact of macrophage
COX-2 inhibition, the macrophages were pretreated with 30
mmol/L celecoxib or vehicle for 1 hour before as well as during
sera exposure. Macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM was

generated by ﬁrst maturing 2  105 U937 monocytes per well
into macrophages on top of conﬂuent preadipocytes seeded in
6-well plates. The coculture was serum-starved for 6 hours,
exposed to a 2% pooled sera in SFM for 1 hour, then washed
with PBS and incubated for 24 hours in SFM  testosterone
(100 nmol/L), anastrozole (1 mmol/L), and/or vehicle. The CM
was then collected and stored at 20 C for subsequent in vitro
assays. This CM was supplemented with 2% charcoal-stripped
(CS)-FBS before use in all assays to provide a baseline level of
the nutrients needed for cellular function, absent any hormones that would interfere with our evaluation of the effects of
the estradiol produced by preadipocytes.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Macrophage PTGS2 (COX-2) mRNA levels were measured
following a 6-hour serum-starvation period (baseline), then a
1-hour exposure to 2% sera from obese or normal-weight
patients in SFM, and after a subsequent 12 and 24 hours in
SFM (following the removal of the sera). Preadipocyte CYP19A1
(aromatase) mRNA levels were assessed following a 24-hour
incubation in macrophage CM. MCF-7 and T47D TFF1 (pS2) and
CCND1 (cyclin D1) mRNA levels were measured after a 24-hour
incubation in macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM supplemented with 2% CS-FBS. All cells were serum-starved for 6 hours
before exposure to sera or CM. Total RNA was isolated using
TRizol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with Promega's ImProm II Reverse Transcription System. The primer
sequences are as follows: PTGS2: forward, 50 -CCCTTGGGTGTCAAAGGTAA-30 ; reverse, 50 -GCCCTCGCTTATGATCT

The manufacturer's recommended cycling conditions for the
QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) were used. Data
shown represent the average of at least three independent
experiments, with the exception of preadipocyte aromatase
expression measured following culture in macrophage CM

by dividing the ﬂuorescence value (standardized to renilla)
from cells grown in each experimental condition by that from
cells grown in CM generated with exposure to sera from
patients of normal weight followed by incubation in SFM plus
testosterone. Data shown represent the average of at least
three independent experiments.
Cell proliferation and migration
MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was measured using cell counting by hemocytometer following a 48-hour
incubation in macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM supplemented with 2% CS-FBS. The cells were seeded in 24-well plates
at a density of 1  104 cells/well for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells and 1.5  104 cells/well for T47D cells. Migration of these
same cell lines was assessed using the wound healing assay as
previously described (22) following a 24-hour incubation in
macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM supplemented with
2% CS-FBS. For both experiments, the cells were serum-starved
for 6 hours before treatment. Data shown represent the average
of at least three independent experiments.
Statistical analyses
Patient data. The data were examined for normality.
Duplicates were also analyzed to guarantee that one patient
was not recorded twice in the event of referrals or transfer of
care to the other clinic. Pearson x2 tests were used to analyze
categorical variables of NSAID users and nonusers. A Student t
test was used to examine mean differences in numerical
variables. Time to recurrence was assessed by the Wilcox
nonparametric test. Age at diagnosis and tumor stage were
included as a priori confounding factors. Logistic regression
was used to predict recurrence. A P value of <0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were performed in
R Foundation for Statistical Computing (version 2.10.1).
In vitro data. Differences between cells exposed to 2
different experimental conditions were measured using the
Student t test. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze COX-2
expression. For experiments involving 2 independent variables,
2-way ANOVA was used. A P value of <0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

Results

PGE2 and estradiol concentrations
The concentration of PGE2 in macrophage CM and sera was
measured using the PGE2 Parameter Assay Kit from R&D
Systems. The estradiol concentration in macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM and sera was analyzed with the Estradiol
EIA Kit from Cayman Chemical.

Patient characteristics
The patient population consisted of 440 women with invasive, ERa-positive breast cancer. NSAID users did not significantly differ from nonusers by BMI category, tumor stage,
hormone receptor status, tumor type, race, or type of surgery.
Not surprisingly, NSAID users were more likely to be older,
postmenopausal, and diabetic. The majority of patients in
our population were overweight/obese (BMI  25 kg/m2),
such that the average BMI for both users and nonusers was
>30 kg/m2 (Table 1).

ERE luciferase assay
The ERE luciferase assay was performed as described previously (21), with the MCF-7 and T47D cells exposed for 48
hours to the macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM supplemented with 2% CS-FBS. Relative ERa activity was calculated

statin drugs and omega 3 fatty acids, which also have antiinﬂammatory effects, NSAID users' recurrence rate was still
approximately half the rate of nonusers (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.23–
1.08). NSAID users remained disease-free for an average of 78.5
months, whereas nonusers averaged 50.6 months, a difference
of more than 2 years (Table 1). Overweight/obese patients had
a 1.86-fold higher risk of recurrence versus normal-weight
patients when controlling for NSAID use and type of hormone
therapy (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 0.76–5.62; Table 2). Unfortunately,
the small number of normal-weight patients, combined with
their low rate of recurrence, precluded our ability to examine
whether NSAID use was more effective in preventing recurrence in patients with an elevated BMI. However, despite
the small sample size, we found that NSAID use was associated with a substantial reduction in recurrence rate in this
predominantly overweight/obese postmenopausal patient
population. Larger studies have observed more modest effects
(23–25).

We next sought to determine whether the NSAID-associated

on local aromatase expression. To this end, we utilized an

sera samples from obese or normal-weight postmenopausal
patients with breast cancer to mimic the tumor microenvironment of obese versus normal-weight women. The characteristics of the serum donors, including serum concentrations of
various cytokines, adipokines, and growth factors, have been
previously described (21). Following a 1 hour exposure to OB
sera, COX-2 expression in cultured macrophages was a modest
24% higher than cells exposed to N sera (Fig. 1A). However,
exposure to OB sera for 1 hour increased macrophage PGE2
production 5-fold versus N sera in the 24 hours following sera
removal (Fig. 1B). Consequently, we assessed whether macrophage COX-2 expression may continue to increase during that
24-hour period following sera removal, ﬁnding that mRNA
levels were 68% and 92% greater in OB versus N sera–exposed
cells at 12 and 24 hours, respectively (Fig. 1C). Preadipocytes
cultured in CM from macrophages exposed to OB versus N sera
had 52% greater aromatase expression (Fig. 1D). Treatment of
the macrophages with celecoxib during sera exposure neutralized the difference in preadipocyte aromatase expression, suggesting that OB sera–induced macrophage PGE2 production
may be responsible for this effect. Preadipocyte aromatase
expression was also measured following growth in CM from
macrophages exposed to serum from 10 individual OB or N
postmenopausal women, allowing us to examine whether similar results are obtained using nonpooled serum with the data
averaged by BMI category. Serum from ineligible control subjects in the Polish Women's Health Study, a breast cancer case–
control study that has been described previously (18), was used,
enabling us to additionally determine whether our results are
unique to sera obtained from a speciﬁc patient population. The
average preadipocyte aromatase expression was over 2-fold
greater following culture in macrophage CM generated with OB
versus N subjects' sera (Fig. 1E), supporting the ﬁndings obtained using pooled sera from the CTRC patients. Finally, the OB
sera–induced increase in aromatase expression was correlated
with a 16-fold ampliﬁcation in preadipocyte estradiol production in the presence of exogenous testosterone, the substrate
for aromatase (Fig. 1F). The addition of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole to the macrophage/preadipocyte coculture
following sera exposure completely nulliﬁed the difference
between OB and N, demonstrating that the increase in estradiol

production was solely because of the OB sera's effect on
aromatase expression.
Obese patient serum contains higher arachidonic acid
and saturated fatty acid levels
Given our ﬁnding that exposure to the OB versus N patient
sera promotes greater macrophage COX-2 expression and
PGE2 production, we next explored 2 possible mechanisms
mediating this effect by proﬁling the fatty acid content of the
sera. The concentration of arachidonic acid, the omega-6 fatty
acid substrate utilized by COX-2 for PGE2 production, was
signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.001) in the OB patient sera. The
palmitate level as well as the total level of saturated fatty acids,
which can stimulate macrophage COX-2 expression (15), were
also higher (P < 0.001) in the OB patient sera (Table 3). We then
measured PGE2 and estradiol levels in the patient sera, as
systemic levels of these factors may also impact tumor progression, but there were no signiﬁcant differences between OB
and N (Table 3).

determine whether the resulting elevation in estradiol promotes enhanced breast cancer cell ERa activity. ERa-positive breast cancer cells cultured in CM from OB versus N

activity after culture in macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM, as measured by ERE luciferase reporter (A and B) and qPCR analysis of pS2 (C and D)
and cyclin D1 (E and F) expression. Experimental conditions include CM from cocultures exposed to sera from obese or normal-weight patients (OB-CM
and N-CM), followed by incubation in serum-free media with testosterone plus vehicle, testosterone plus anastrozole, vehicle alone, or anastrozole alone. Data

cells, respectively (Fig. 2A and B). Coculture treatment with
anastrozole after sera exposure signiﬁcantly decreased the
OB-induced ERa activity in both cell lines, eliminating the
difference between OB versus N CM-induced breast cancer
cell ERa activity. OB and N coculture CM produced without
testosterone stimulated MCF-7 and T47D cell ERa activity
that was statistically equivalent to that induced by CM from
cocultures treated with testosterone and anastrozole. Similar results were obtained when the CM was generated with
anastrozole treatment but no testosterone. This shows that
the presence of testosterone during coculture CM generation is required for the OB-induced elevation in breast
cancer cell ERa activity, further demonstrating that this
effect is because of preadipocyte aromatase activity. We
utilized pS2 and cyclin D1 expression as additional measures
of ERa activity, obtaining analogous results. Following
growth in OB versus N CM, pS2 expression was 49% higher
in MCF-7 cells and 63% greater in T47D cells (Fig. 2C and D)
whereas cyclin D1 expression was elevated by 70% in MCF-7
cells and 78% in T47D cells (Fig. 2E and F). Coculture
treatment with anastrozole neutralized these differences in
pS2 and cyclin D1 expression in both cell lines and, as seen
with the ERE luciferase assays, CM generated without testosterone stimulated equivalent expression. Together, these
results demonstrate that the obesity-associated, COX-2induced increase in preadipocyte aromatase expression and
estradiol production can enhance breast cancer cell ERa
activity.

Breast cancer cell proliferation and migration are
induced by obesity-associated preadipocyte aromatase
expression
To determine whether the obesity-associated, COX-2–
induced elevation in preadipocyte aromatase expression and
breast cancer cell ERa activity could result in enhanced disease
progression, we assessed the impact of the macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM on breast cancer cell proliferation and
migration. Culturing MCF-7 and T47D cells in OB versus N CM
generated with exogenous testosterone increased proliferation
by 59% and 55%, respectively (Fig. 3A and B). Treatment of the
coculture with anastrozole during CM generation eliminated
the difference between OB and N, demonstrating that the OB
CM's elevated estradiol concentration is responsible for its
effect on cell proliferation. This conclusion is further supported
by the lack of any difference in proliferation levels in MDA-MB231 cells, an ERa-negative breast cancer cell line, following
culture in the 4 CM conditions (Fig. 3C). A similar trend was
seen when we examined the impact of the coculture CM on
ERa-positive breast cancer cell migration. OB CM stimulated
57% more MCF-7 and 46% greater T47D cell migration in
comparison to N CM (Fig. 4A and B). This effect was neutralized in the T47D cells by treatment of the coculture with
anastrozole during CM production. However, although aromatase inhibition signiﬁcantly decreased OB-induced MCF-7
cell migration, these cells still migrated farther than those
cultured in N CM with anastrozole. Intriguingly, the migration
of MDA-MB-231 cells was also signiﬁcantly enhanced by

culture in OB versus N CM (Fig. 4C). Consistent with this cell
line's ERa-negative status, anastrozole treatment during CM
generation did not affect the CM's impact on migration.
Overall, these ﬁndings strongly suggest that obesity-associated
circulating factors may promote ERa-positive breast cancer
progression via stimulation of macrophage COX-2 expression
and the subsequent increase in preadipocyte aromatase
expression.

Discussion
Suboptimal pharmacologic aromatase inhibition in postmenopausal patients with ERa-positive breast cancer has
detrimental consequences to clinical outcome. COX-2 is a
critical node for the convergence of various upstream pathways of inﬂammation, including IL1, IL6, and TNFa signaling
(26, 27), and it seems to be a key mediator of biologic processes
affecting treatment failure, such as PGE2 synthesis and the
resulting aromatase expression and estrogen production. Our
study is the ﬁrst to speciﬁcally examine the molecular mechanisms that may mediate the impact of daily NSAID use on
recurrence rate and time to disease progression in patients
with invasive breast cancer receiving adjuvant endocrine
therapy. We have demonstrated that the NSAID users in this
patient population had a 52% lower recurrence rate. A similar
trend was seen after controlling for patient age and tumor
stage at diagnosis, although the strength of the association was
reduced (data not shown). This is not surprising given that latestage tumors, as well as the aggressive tumors that disproportionately develop in younger women, seem less likely to
signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from the modest effects of this drug group.
NSAID users also remained disease-free for more than 2 years
longer than nonusers, a difference that was not statistically
signiﬁcant but may be a clinically relevant variance in
outcome.
Similar results have been obtained in some larger prospective studies examining NSAID use after breast cancer diagnosis. Holmes and colleagues (23) showed that aspirin use 6 to 7
days/week was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in the
risk of recurrence (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39–0.82). Utilizing the

www.aacrjournals.org

Nurses' Health Study's substantial pool of subjects, the authors
found no change in these results after stratifying by BMI,
menopausal status, and ER status. In an analysis of postmenopausal breast cancer patient outcomes, Blair and colleagues
(25) observed that any amount of regular NSAID use was
correlated with a lower risk of breast cancer death (HR,
0.64; 95% CI, 0.39–1.05). Adjustment for ERa status, but not
BMI category, increased the HR and reduced the statistical
signiﬁcance of this association. In contrast with these studies,
the recurrence rate in a population of pre- and postmenopausal patients was not decreased by aspirin use 3 days/week
(RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.74–1.61), but was affected by use of
ibuprofen (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32–0.98; ref. 24). Controlling for
BMI, menopausal status, and ERa did not alter these results.
The variability in design and patient population among
these studies makes any comparison with our results difﬁcult.
Cumulatively, they seem to indicate that NSAID use may be an
effective addition to adjuvant breast cancer treatment, regardless of BMI, ERa, or menopausal status. However, the association between NSAID use and a 50% lower disease recurrence
in our study, despite a relatively small patient population, led
us to hypothesize that the overwhelming prevalence of overweight/obesity among this population may have increased the
NSAID beneﬁt. Our patient population was also largely postmenopausal and included only hormone responsive patients.
Because obesity and overweight status are associated with
higher PGE2 levels and aromatase expression in female breast
tissue (13, 14), it seems likely that the efﬁcacy of COX-2
inhibitors in a postmenopausal, ERa-positive patient population would increase with greater adiposity. Perhaps the lack of
variation in effect among BMI categories in previous studies is
because of their failure to stratify the data by BMI, ERa, and
menopausal status simultaneously. This question could potentially be addressed by previous trials assessing the clinical
beneﬁt of a celecoxib/aromatase inhibitor combination treatment for postmenopausal, hormone-responsive breast cancer.
Most of these studies showed a modest beneﬁt with at least 3
months of combination treatment, including trends toward
more clinical complete response, longer duration of clinical
beneﬁt, and greater progression-free survival (28–30).

cancer cell migration during incubation in macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM. Experimental conditions include CM from cocultures exposed to
sera from obese or normal-weight patients (OB-CM and N-CM) followed by culture in serum-free media with testosterone plus vehicle (OB þ T-CM, N þ T-CM)
or testosterone plus anastrozole (OB þ T þ AI-CM, N þ T þ AI-CM). Data shown represent the average of at least three independent experiments. Different
letters indicate signiﬁcant differences, P < 0.05.

Unfortunately, none of these trials analyzed the treatment
beneﬁt by BMI category, so it is impossible to determine from
this data whether overweight/obese women in this patient
population are more likely to beneﬁt from COX-2 inhibition. To
our knowledge, no one has examined the efﬁcacy of a COX-2
inhibitor/aromatase inhibitor combination in animal models
of obesity and mammary carcinogenesis either.
Given that obesity has been associated with a worse breast
cancer prognosis (3–7) as well as a reduced response to
aromatase inhibitor therapy among postmenopausal, ERapositive patients (8, 9), determination of whether this speciﬁc population will beneﬁt from COX-2 inhibition is an
important question. Dannenberg and colleagues have demonstrated an obesity-associated, COX-2-induced elevation in
preadipocyte aromatase expression using both preclinical
models and patient breast tissue (13–15). Our aim was to
conﬁrm this phenomenon, using an in vitro model of the
obese patient's breast tumor microenvironment, as well as
determine whether this increased preadipocyte aromatase
expression can promote greater epithelial cell ERa activity
and subsequent proliferation and migration, 2 in vitro mea-

sures of cancer progression. We show that exposure to sera
from obese postmenopausal women stimulates signiﬁcantly
greater macrophage COX-2 expression and a 5-fold increase
in PGE2 production. Saturated fatty acids can promote COX2 expression and PGE2 production in cultured macrophages
(15, 31), and the increased lipolysis that accompanies obesity
results in a higher concentration of circulating free fatty
acids, particularly palmitate (32–34). We conﬁrmed that the
obese patient sera contains signiﬁcantly higher levels of
palmitate, total saturated fatty acids, and arachidonic acid,
the omega-6 fatty acid substrate utilized by COX-2 to
produce PGE2. Consequently, this difference in macrophage
COX-2 expression and PGE2 production may be because of
elevated levels of these free fatty acids in the obese patient
sera. There is also some evidence that the inﬂammatory
cytokines IL6 and TNFa, found in higher concentrations in
our obese patient serum samples (21), can induce COX-2
expression (27, 35, 36). This suggests that more than one
mechanism may be responsible for the obesity-associated
upregulation of macrophage COX-2 expression and PGE2
production seen in this study.

NSAIDs Beneﬁt Obese Patients with Breast Cancer

Given our in vitro results, it may seem surprising that we
found no difference between the OB and N patient sera in PGE2
and estradiol concentrations. However, PGE2 has a short halflife, so urinary concentrations of the stable end metabolite of
PGE2 catabolism (PGE-M) are typically used to assess systemic
PGE2 levels (37). In fact, although an elevated BMI has been
associated with increased PGE-M levels (38), we are not aware
of any studies demonstrating higher circulating PGE2 levels
with obesity. In contrast, the lack of difference in serum
estradiol levels by BMI does not agree with the literature, as
researchers have generally found that obese postmenopausal
women have higher estradiol levels (39–41). However, of the 25
women that provided the sera for this study, 9 obese patients
and 1 normal-weight patient were receiving an aromatase
inhibitor (21), which may have masked any difference in
estradiol levels between the groups.
Taken together, our in vitro data provide compelling
evidence that an obesity-associated increase in macrophage
COX-2 expression promotes greater preadipocyte aromatase
expression and estradiol production, resulting in an elevation in breast cancer cell ERa activity, proliferation, and
migration. Neutralization of the obesity-induced elevation in
ERa activity and cell proliferation by the addition of aromatase inhibitor treatment validates our hypothesis that
these effects are because of preadipocyte aromatase expression. However, although incubation of the ERa-negative
MDA-MB-231 cells in OB versus N macrophage/preadipocyte coculture CM did not differentially affect cell proliferation, it did stimulate signiﬁcantly greater cell migration. In
addition, OB CM continued to promote more extensive
MCF-7 cell migration in comparison to N CM with aromatase inhibition during CM generation, although anastrozole
did signiﬁcantly decrease the OB CM-induced migration.
These results indicate that, although locally produced estradiol clearly plays a role in mediating obesity-associated
breast cancer cell migration, one or more additional signaling molecules produced by macrophages and/or preadipocytes is involved in this effect. Macrophage-derived PGE2 is
one possibility, as it is known to promote breast cancer cell
migration (42, 43). Several studies have concluded that it
also stimulates breast cancer cell proliferation based on the
ability of COX-2 inhibitors to hinder proliferation (44, 45).
However, we saw no differential proliferation in the MDAMB-231 cells following incubation in OB versus N CM, and
Robertson and colleagues (46) demonstrated that treatment
of MDA-MB-231 cells with exogenous PGE2 does not
increase proliferation. The role of additional locally produced signaling molecules in the link between obesity-associated inﬂammation and breast cancer progression is an
area that deserves further exploration in future studies.
This study focused on exploring how COX-2 inhibition via
NSAID use could reduce breast cancer recurrence in obese
and overweight women. However, a large majority of the
NSAID users in our study were taking aspirin, which preferentially inhibits the COX-1 enzyme over COX-2 (47).
Although most researchers consider suppression of COX-2
activity to be the predominant mechanism by which aspirin
reduces cancer risk and progression, a few have examined

www.aacrjournals.org

the role of COX-1 in tumorigenesis. Hwang and colleagues
(48) found that a majority of breast tumor samples overexpress COX-1, whereas Jeong and colleagues (49) demonstrated that a selective COX-1 inhibitor reduces MCF-7 cell
growth. Others have shown that the combined inhibition of
COX-1 and COX-2 produces a signiﬁcantly greater suppression of breast cancer cell growth than either alone (50).
Obesity has not been linked to increased COX-1 expression
or activity, though, so we did not pursue an examination of
this enzyme as part of our study.
Our current investigation strongly suggests that local estradiol production, induced by macrophage COX-2 activity, may
be a key mediator in the link between obesity and postmenopausal, hormone-responsive breast cancer progression. This
conclusion is supported by the clinical observation of a 52%
lower recurrence rate and 28-month extension in time to
recurrence with NSAID use in a largely overweight/obese and
postmenopausal patient population with ERa-positive disease.
Collectively, our results provide a strong rationale for further
studies about the clinical beneﬁt of aromatase inhibitor/COX-2
inhibitor combination treatment for obese, postmenopausal
patients with breast cancer.
