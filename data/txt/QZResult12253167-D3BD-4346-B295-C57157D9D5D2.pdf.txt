Abstract
STAT3 is persistently activated and contributes to malignant progression in various cancers. Janus activated
kinases (JAK) phosphorylate STAT3 in response to stimulation by cytokines or growth factors. The STAT3
signaling pathway has been validated as a promising target for development of anticancer therapeutics. Smallmolecule inhibitors of JAK/STAT3 signaling represent potential molecular-targeted cancer therapeutic agents.
In this study, we investigated the role of JAK/STAT3 signaling in 6-bromoindirubin-30 -oxime (6BIO)-mediated
growth inhibition of human melanoma cells and assessed 6BIO as a potential anticancer drug candidate. We
found that 6BIO is a pan-JAK inhibitor that induces apoptosis of human melanoma cells. 6BIO directly inhibited
JAK-family kinase activity, both in vitro and in cancer cells. Apoptosis of human melanoma cells induced by 6BIO
was associated with reduced phosphorylation of JAKs and STAT3 in both dose- and time-dependent manners.
Consistent with inhibition of STAT3 signaling, expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 was downregulated.
In contrast to the decreased levels of phosphorylation of JAKs and STAT3, phosphorylation levels of the Akt and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling proteins were not inhibited in cells treated with 6BIO.
Importantly, 6BIO suppressed tumor growth in vivo with low toxicity in a mouse xenograft model of melanoma.
Taken together, these results show that 6BIO is a novel pan-JAK inhibitor that can selectively inhibit STAT3
signaling and induces tumor cell apoptosis. Our findings support further development of 6BIO as a potential
anticancer therapeutic agent that targets JAK/STAT3 signaling in tumor cells. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3972–9. 2011

Introduction
The Janus activated kinase (JAK) family includes JAK1,
JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Whereas JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 are
ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, JAK3 expression
is restricted to hematopoietic cells (1–2). The kinases of the
JAK family activate STAT proteins in response to different
cytokines and growth factors (2–5). In normal cells, JAK/STAT
signaling is tightly regulated. However, in cancer cells, it is
persistently activated due to the aberrant activation of JAK
family kinases or other tyrosine kinases. As one of the more
recently recognized oncogenic signaling pathways, JAK/
STAT3 signaling has been shown to be important for tumorAuthors' Affiliations: 1Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute,

igenesis. Among the 7 STAT family members, STAT3 is most
frequently aberrantly activated in human cancer cells. Persistent activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling contributes to the
malignancy of tumors by promoting tumor cell proliferation
and survival, angiogenesis, and immune evasion (6–10). Thus,
JAK/STAT3 signaling is a promising molecular target in cancer
therapy.
Recently, small-molecule inhibitors of JAK/STAT3 signaling
have been identified for development of cancer therapeutics.
Discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation in myeloproliferative
disease has prompted development of selective JAK2 inhibitors for treatment of hematologic disorders (11–13). Clinical
studies of JAK2 inhibitors are currently ongoing (14–15).
Furthermore, the role of constitutive JAK2 kinase activity in
myeloproliferative neoplastic growth provides the rationale
for investigating JAK inhibitors in solid tumors. Small-molecule inhibitors of JAK/STAT3 signaling have been reported to
suppress cancer cell growth, both in vitro and in vivo (16–22).
Indirubin, a bis-indole alkaloid, is the active ingredient of
Dang Gui Long Hui Wan, a traditional Chinese medicine for
treatment of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) (23–24).
Indirubins, namely indirubin and some indirubin derivatives
(IRD), are known to be inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDK), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and glycogen
phosphorylase b. In addition, some IRDs induce apoptosis in
human cancer cells through inhibition of Src/STAT3 signaling

(25–29), thus suggesting that STAT3 signaling might be a
potential target for IRDs.
Bromo-IRDs are novel synthetic IRDs with improved
potency (30–33). In this study, we have identified 6BIO as a
pan-JAK inhibitor, selectively targeting JAK/STAT3 signaling
in human melanoma cells. Among a series of synthetic IRDs,
6BIO shows the best anticancer activity, and induces apoptosis of melanoma cells. 6BIO suppressed tumor growth with
low toxicity in an A2058 human melanoma xenograft mouse
model. We investigated the effects of 6BIO particularly on
human melanoma cells because of a need for more effective
therapeutics for this tumor site. Dacarbazine, the only Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for treatment
of metastatic melanoma, has an approximately 15% response
rate (34–35). Thus, 6BIO as a pan-JAK inhibitor represents a
promising lead compound for development of new anticancer
therapeutics, particularly for melanoma.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
The preparation of IRDs has been described previously (30).
Compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a
concentration of 20 mmol/L and stored at 20 C before use
for in vitro experiments and treatments in cells. For in vivo
experiments, 6BIO was freshly prepared in 30% Solutol (Basf)
at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Anti-survivin was obtained
from Novus and Anti–b-actin was obtained from Sigma.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-mouse and antirabbit secondary antibodies were procured from GE Healthcare. All other antibodies were from purchased from Cell
Signaling.
Cell lines and culture
The A2058, G361, SK-MEL-5, and SK-MEL-28 human melanoma, DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer, U266 myeloma,
and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection. MDA-MB-468 cells
were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. Other
types of cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. The cellculture medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S).
Cell-viability assay
Human cancer cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a
density of 5,000 cells per well. After 24-hour incubation, cells
were treated with IRDs or DMSO as the vehicle control for 48
hour. An MTS Reagent (CellTiter 96 AQueousOne Solution Cell
proliferation Assay; Promega) was added to each well according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm within 4 hours of the reaction by a Microplate
Reader (Bio-Rad). The values of cell viability were calculated as
percentages of absorbance from treated samples to absorbance from the vehicle control.
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis
Cells were seeded on 6-well plates with 50,000 cells per well
in 3 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and

www.aacrjournals.org

1% P/S. After 24-hour incubation, cells were treated with 6BIO
or DMSO for 24 or 48 hours. After treatment, all cells were
collected, and apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry
by the Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with inhibitors of proteases
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and sodium orthovanadate, an
inhibitor of phosphotases (Aldrich). Protein concentrations
were determined by BioMate Spectrometer (Thermo) and
protein assay (Bio-Rad). A sample of 40 mg of each protein
was resolved in 8% or between 8% and 16% gradient SDSPAGE gels (Pierce). After gel electrophoresis, proteins were
transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1%
Tween 20 (Polysorbate 20; PBST) at room temperature for 1 to
3 hours followed by an overnight incubation at 4 C with
primary antibodies in PBST containing 5% nonfat milk. The
membranes were then washed with PBST and incubated with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% nonfat milk/PBST
solution for 1 to 3 hours at room temperature, or overnight at
4 C. Specific proteins were detected by exposure to X-ray film
by using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
or SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate
(Pierce).
Kinase assay
Recombinant JAKs, substrates, and 33P-labeled ATP were
used for in vitro kinase assays. The recombinant JAK catalytic domains were tagged with glutathione S-transferase
(GST) and purified from insect cells. The substrate was
prepared in freshly constituted Base Reaction Buffer
[comprising 20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.5; 10 mmol/L MgCl2;
1 mmol/L EGTA; 0.02% BRIJ-35; 0.02 mg/mL BSA; 0.1
mmol/L Na3VO4; 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT); and 1%
DMSO]. Then, required cofactors and kinase were added into
the substrate solution. Compounds in DMSO were delivered
into the kinase reaction mixture, and the 33P-labeled ATP
(specific activity: 0.01 mCi/mL final) was added into the
reaction mixture to initiate the reaction. The kinase reaction
mixture was incubated for 120 minutes at room temperature. Reactions were spotted onto P81 ion-exchange paper
(Whatman) for measurement of radioactivity.
In vivo therapeutic efficacy testing
BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from the
National Cancer Institute for toxicity study. Immunodeficient
NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma null (NSG) mice (female; 6–8 weeks
old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory for use as
the xenograft model. The experimental protocol for animal
experiments was approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Medical Center. A2058 human melanoma
cells at a density of 5  106 cells in serum-free medium were
inoculated subcutaneously into the dorsal area of NSG
mice to create the xenograft model. When tumors became

palpable, 6BIO or vehicle control was administered via oral
gavage once daily at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Tumor

Results
Bromoindirubin derivatives inhibit cell viability in
human cancer cells
We screened synthetic IRDs by using MTS cell-viability
assays in A2058 cells, which are derived from metastatic
lymph node melanoma. Two bromo-IRDs—MLS-2407 (6BIO)
and MLS-2408—showed the most potent anticancer activity
(Table 1). 6BIO is an IRD with double modifications of
oxime- and bromo-groups, whereas MLS-2412 is an IRD
with double modifications of oxime- and fluoro-groups at
30 - and 6-positions, respectively. MLS-2446 and -2406 are
IRDs with single modification of oxime-group or bromogroup at 30 - or 6-position. Among 6BIO, MLS-2446, -2406, and
-2412, 6BIO decreased the viability of melanoma cells to 31%

at a concentration of 10 mmol/L, whereas MLS-2446, -2406,
and -2412 showed marginal anticancer activities (Table 1),
indicating that modifications with both 30 -oxime- and 6bromo-groups are important for anticancer potency.
Furthermore, 6BIO inhibits cell viability in other human
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, 6BIO was
selected for further study.
6BIO inhibits viability of human melanoma cells and
phosphorylation of STAT3 and its upstream tyrosine
kinases
In primary screening assays, A2058 human melanoma cells
were sensitive to 6BIO. We further compared the effects of
6BIO on A2058, G361, SK-MEL-5, and SK-MEL-28 human
melanoma cell lines (Fig. 1). Cell viability was inhibited in
all 4 melanoma cell lines. IC50 values are approximately
5 mmol/L for A2058 and G361 cells, and 12 mmol/L for SKMEL-5 and SK-MEL-28 cells (Fig. 1A). Previous studies showed
that human melanoma cells harbor persistently activated
STAT3, which contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis
(6). Phosphorylation of JAK2, Src, and STAT3 was inhibited at
10 mmol/L of 6BIO 4 hours after treatment in melanoma cells
(Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of Src was inhibited in G361, SKMEL-5, and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cell lines, whereas phosphorylation of JAK2 was inhibited in A2058 and G361 cell lines
and only partially inhibited in SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-28, both
of which are more resistant cell lines. Phosphorylation of Src

and 0.5 mmol/L for JAK3 (Supplementary Fig. S3). These
findings suggest that 6BIO is a novel pan-JAK small-molecule inhibitor.
6BIO selectively inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 in
human melanoma cells
To investigate the selectivity of inhibition on JAK/STAT3
signaling, Src and other two important signaling proteins,
Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; Erk1/2)
were examined. Western blots were done to detect the levels
of total and phosphorylated Src, STAT3, Akt, and MAPK
(Erk1/2; Fig. 3). In contrast to the inhibition of phosphorylation of JAK family kinases (Fig. 2A), phosphorylation of
Src was not changed (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of STAT3
was decreased whereas phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK
(Erk1/2) was not inhibited in all of the 4 human melanoma
cell lines (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that, among
signaling pathways of STAT3, Akt, and MAPK, 6BIO selectively inhibits JAK/STAT3 signaling in human melanoma
cells.

phosphorylation of JAK2 was substantially inhibited (Fig. 1B).
Consistent inhibition of phosphorylation of JAK2 in all melanoma cell lines suggests that JAK family kinases may be
relevant targets in melanoma cells.
6BIO inhibits phosphorylation of JAK family kinases in
cells and JAK enzymatic activity in vitro
Human melanoma cells express JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2.
We further investigated effects of 6BIO on JAK1, JAK2, and
TYK2 in A2058, SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, and G361 cell lines.
In A2058 cells, 6BIO inhibited phosphorylation of JAK1,
JAK2, and TYK2 in a dose-dependent manner at both 4
hours (Fig. 2A) and 24 hours (Fig. 2B) after treatment as
well as in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of
phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 was observed in
A2058 cells as early as within 5 minutes after treatment
with 10 mmol/L 6BIO (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Furthermore, reduction of levels of phosphorylated JAK1, JAK2,
and TYK2 was detected in SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, and G361
cells at 4 hours after treatment with 10 mmol/L 6BIO
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). To determine whether 6BIO is
a pan-JAK inhibitor, we further investigated the effect of
6BIO on JAK enzymatic activity in an in vitro kinase assay.
Activities of JAK family kinases were inhibited in a dosedependent manner. The IC50 values are 0.03 mmol/L for

6BIO induces apoptosis of human melanoma cells
associated with downregulation of antiapoptotic
protein Mcl-1
STAT3 activation is involved in cell survival in human
cancer cells (6). We examined STAT3 downstream antiapoptotic proteins including Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin.
Expression of Mcl-1 was decreased in a dose-dependent
manner in A2058 cells (Fig. 4A) and other human melanoma
cell lines (Fig. 4B). Cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3 were
detected at 5 mmol/L 24 hours after treatment. The levels of
full-length PARP and caspase-3 were decreased corresponding
to the increased levels of cleaved forms (Fig. 4C). 6BIO induced
apoptosis of human melanoma cells in both dose- and timedependent manners (Fig. 4D). These results show that 6BIO
induces melanoma cell apoptosis at least in part by inhibition
of Mcl-1.
6BIO suppresses melanoma tumor growth in a mouse
xenograft model
The anticancer activity of 6BIO in vivo was studied with an
A2058 human melanoma xenograft mouse model. We first
tested the toxicity of 6BIO in BALB/c normal mice. 6BIO, at
the dose of 100 mg/kg, was found to be safe for the mice
(Fig. 5A). Then, we used a dose of 50 mg/kg for 6BIO therapy
study in the NSG mouse xenograft model by oral administration once daily for 2 weeks. As shown in Figure 5B, the
tumor growth was significantly suppressed. No side effects
were observed in the 6BIO- treated mice. These findings
show the antitumor activity of 6BIO in vivo against human
melanoma cells.

modifications to improve its selectivity profile, kinase

Furthermore, 6BIO inhibited cell viability strongly whereas
6-fluoroindirubin-30 -oxime (6FIO; MLS-2412) is a very weak
inhibitor of cell viability (Table 1), indicating bromo-substitution is more important than fluoro-substitution at
the 6-position. Substitution at the 5-position with a nitrogroup as in MLS-2418 and -2419 reduced anticancer activity,

inhibitory effect, and solubility (26, 30). In particular, modifications have been carried out on positions 5 or 6 on one
indole ring and 30 of the other indole ring. The IRDs shown
in Table 1 were synthesized with modifications at 30 -, 5-, and
6-positions. 6BIO and MLS-2408 showed the most potent
anticancer activity. These active bromo-IRDs contain a
bromo-group at the 6-position and a hydrophilic group at

at various concentrations for 24 hours. Cells were lysed for Western blot analysis by using antibodies specific to Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and b-actin.
B, human melanoma SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, and G361 cells were treated with 10 mmol/L of 6BIO for 24 hours. Cells were lysed for Western blot
analysis by using antibodies specific to Mcl-1 and b-actin. C, human melanoma A2058 cells were treated with 6BIO at various concentrations for 24 hours.
Cells were lysed for Western blot analysis by using antibodies specific to PARP, Caspase-3, and b-actin. D, A2058 cells were treated with 6BIO at
various concentrations for 24 or 48 hours. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry by using Annexin V–FITC staining.

compared with 6BIO and MLS-2408. This finding suggests
that modification at the 5-position with a nitro-group is
unnecessary for anticancer activity of 6-bromoindirubins.
Comparing the structures and activities of 6BIO, MLS-2446,
and MLS-2406, we found that both substitution of an oximegroup at the 30 -position and substitution of a bromo-group
at the 6-position are important to enhance anticancer
activity.
It is interesting that 6BIO displays differential inhibition
of JAK family kinase activity in an in vitro system by using
recombinant JAKs (Fig. 2D). 6BIO inhibits TYK2 most
potently (IC50 value: 0.03 mmol/L), whereas the IC50 value
is 8 mmol/L for JAK2 kinase activity. The IC50 value of JAK1
kinase activity is similar in vitro as it is in intact A2058 cells.
The differential inhibition of phosphorylated JAKs in human
melanoma cells is not as dramatic as the differential inhibition of JAK activity in an in vitro system (Fig. 2A and D). It is
striking that 6BIO inhibits phosphorylation of JAK2 strongly
in A2058 cells, but it is a weak inhibitor of JAK2 kinase
activity in vitro. We have found that 6BIO inhibits phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 in cells very effectively
although it is not a strong inhibitor for JAK2 in vitro. This
finding is consistent with JAK transphosphorylation and
reciprocal regulation of JAKs in cells. Previous studies
showed that interaction between 2 members among JAK1,
JAK2, and TYK2 regulates JAK activity. In particular, it has
been found that TYK2 is required for kinase activity of JAK2
and/or JAK1 (4, 36–40). The long-term effect of 6BIO on
A2058 human melanoma cells showed substantial differ-

ences between phosphorylated levels of JAK1, JAK2, and
TYK2. Phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 was most potently
inhibited, whereas phosphorylation of JAK2 was least inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). This inhibition
pattern is very similar to the inhibition of in vitro JAK activity
(Fig. 2D). Our findings suggest that TYK2 may regulate
kinase activity of JAK2 and/or JAK1 in human melanoma
cells. In the in vitro system, 6BIO is a strong inhibitor of
TYK2, a moderate inhibitor of JAK1, but a weak inhibitor of
JAK2. However, it is a pan-JAK inhibitor in intact A2058, SKMEL-5, SK-MEL-28, and G361 human melanoma cells (Fig. 2;
Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting reciprocal regulation
among JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 in cells.
Furthermore, as a pan-JAK inhibitor, 6BIO inhibits phosphorylation of Src in human melanoma cells. As shown in
Figure 1B, phosphorylation of both JAK2 and Src was inhibited
in G361, SK-MEL-5, and SK-MEL-28 cells by 6BIO at 10 mmol/L
at 4 hours after treatment, suggesting cooperation between
JAK2 and SRC in G361, SK-MEL-5, and SK-MEL-28 cells to
inhibit STAT3 signaling (41). In addition, in A2058 cells,
phosphorylation of Src was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner 24 hours after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2C),
but it was not inhibited at 4 hours after treatment (Fig. 3A).
This observation may indicate a secondary inhibition of Src by
6BIO in A2058 cells. As shown in Figure 3, comparing with
phosphorylation of Src, Akt, and MAPK, the phosphorylation
of STAT3 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 6BIO 4
hours after treatment. This finding suggests the selective
inhibition of JAK/STAT3 signaling mediated by 6BIO in

Figure 5. 6BIO suppresses melanoma tumor growth in a mouse xenograft
model. A, toxicity study with BALB/c normal mice. 6BIO or vehicle
control was administered, through oral gavage once daily to each group, at
doses of 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg body weight. The maximum tolerated dose
was determined to be 100 mg/kg. B, 6BIO suppressed tumor growth
of A2058 human melanoma xenografts in NSG mice. A2058 cells (density
of 5  106) were inoculated subcutaneously into the dorsal area of NSG
mice. When tumors became palpable, 6BIO or vehicle control was
administrated via oral gavage once daily. Points, mean (n ¼ 8); bars,

human melanoma cells. However, we cannot conclude
that 6BIO is an absolutely selective inhibitor of JAK/STAT3

signaling. Indirubin, an ATP-mimic, was originally identified
as an inhibitor of CDKs. Later, indirubin and its derivatives
have been found to inhibit other kinases, including GSK3-b
and Src. Similarly, we cannot rule out other possible targets of
6BIO such as CDKs, GSK3-b, FLT3, platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGF-R), Src, and VEGF-R (31). In summary,
we show that 6BIO is a pan-JAK inhibitor and inhibits the JAK/
STAT3 signaling pathway, but we do not exclude inhibition of
other pathways.
We have discovered that 6BIO induces apoptosis of
human melanoma cells associated with inhibition of JAK/
STAT3 signaling as a pan-JAK inhibitor. Two other important signaling proteins, Akt and MAPK, are not involved in
the induction of apoptosis. Src may be an indirect target of
6BIO. Our findings suggest TYK2 may regulate the kinase
activity of other JAK family members such as JAK2 and/or
JAK1. In addition, 6BIO is a strong inhibitor of JAK3 (Supplementary Fig. S3). As JAK3 is exclusively expressed in
hematopoietic cells, there are no further data available
regarding JAK3 in melanoma cells, although 6BIO may be
a promising drug candidate for treatment of blood malignancies. Importantly, 6BIO suppresses tumor growth in an
A2058 human melanoma xenograft mouse model. In summary, 6BIO is a promising candidate for development as a
novel therapeutic agent targeting JAK/STAT3 signaling in
melanoma.
