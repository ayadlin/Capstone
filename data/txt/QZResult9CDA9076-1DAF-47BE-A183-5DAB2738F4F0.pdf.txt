SUMMARY
Author Manuscript

We describe the landscape of genomic alterations in cutaneous melanomas through DNA, RNA,
and protein-based analysis of 333 primary and/or metastatic melanomas from 331 patients. We
establish a framework for genomic classification into one of four subtypes based on the pattern of
the most prevalent significantly mutated genes: mutant BRAF, mutant RAS, mutant NF1, and
Triple-WT (wild-type). Integrative analysis reveals enrichment of KIT mutations and focal
amplifications and complex structural rearrangements as a feature of the Triple-WT subtype. We
found no significant outcome correlation with genomic classification, but samples assigned a
transcriptomic subclass enriched for immune gene expression associated with lymphocyte
infiltrate on pathology review and high LCK protein expression, a T cell marker, were associated
with improved patient survival. This clinicopathological and multidimensional analysis suggests
that the prognosis of melanoma patients with regional metastases is influenced by tumor stroma
immunobiology, offering insights to further personalize therapeutic decision-making.

INTRODUCTION
Diagnosis and surgical resection of early-stage primary cutaneous melanoma is often
curative for patients with localized disease, but the prognosis is less favorable for patients
with regional metastases. Using the technique of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph
node (SLN) biopsy (Gershenwald and Ross, 2011), early surgical intervention for patients
with microscopic regional lymph node metastases (i.e., positive SLNs) has recently been
found useful for prognosis, may improve survival in a subgroup of such patients, and serves
to guide the use of adjuvant therapy (Morton et al., 2014). Overall, survival has historically
been poor for patients with distant metastatic disease, and response to conventional
chemotherapy has been infrequent (Balch et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

Hot-spot mutations in the V600 codon of BRAF (35%–50% of melanomas) and Q61 codons
(less frequently, the G12 or G13 codon) of NRAS (10%–25%) led to the development of
highly selective kinase inhibitors that target the MAPK pathway (Tsao et al., 2012). Recent
clinical trials have provided proof of principle that therapeutic agents targeting activating
mutations for patients with unresectable disease and/or distant melanoma metastases can be
identified through genetic analyses. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
three such inhibitors: vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib (McArthur and Ribas, 2013).
Although antitumor responses have been dramatic, they have rarely been durable. Additional
targets and combinatorial treatment strategies are clearly needed.

Author Manuscript

Recent studies using next-generation sequencing (NGS) have identified additional genetic
aberrations (Berger et al., 2012; Hodis et al., 2012; Krauthammer et al., 2012) that provide
insights into the biological heterogeneity of melanoma and also have potentially important
implications for prognosis and therapy. However, previous biomarker studies in melanoma
have either focused on single high-throughput platforms of large sample sets (Hodis et al.,
2012; Krauthammer et al., 2012; Winnepenninckx et al., 2006) or multi-platform analyses of
fewer samples (Mann et al., 2013; Rakosy et al., 2013). No prior study has integrated multiplatform data from such a large cohort of clinico-pathologically well-annotated samples.
To address this gap, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program performed a systematic
multi-platform characterization of 333 cutaneous melanomas at the DNA, RNA, and protein
levels to create a catalog of somatic alterations and describe their potential biological and
clinical significance. We established a genomic/transcriptomic framework of classification
that has potential implications for prognosis and therapy and that may relate to recent
advances in immunotherapy.

RESULTS
Multi-dimensional Genomic Characterization of Cutaneous Melanoma
Compared to most solid tumors, primary melanomas are generally small at diagnosis; and in
routine clinical practice, most or all of primary tumor tissue is used for diagnostic evaluation
and is not available for molecular analyses. Accordingly, our study included samples from
thick primaries, regional, and distant metastatic sites.

Author Manuscript

We collected frozen tumor samples from 333 cutaneous primary and/or metastatic
melanomas with matched peripheral blood from 331 adult patients from 14 tissue source
sites under protocols approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards.
Clinicopathological characteristics are summarized in Table S1A. The samples consisted of
67 (20%) primary cutaneous melanomas (all originating from non-glabrous skin) and 266
(80%) metastases. Of the metastases, 212 were from regional sites (160 from regional lymph
nodes and 52 from regional skin/soft tissue), and 35 were from distant sites (Table S1A–
S1C). At initial diagnosis, patients had primary tumors (whether or not the primary tumors
were included in the TCGA molecular analyses) that were thicker (median and mean, 2.7
mm and 4.9 mm, respectively) than in population-based registry data (Baade et al., 2012;
Criscione and Weinstock, 2010). Matched primary and metastatic samples were available
for complete molecular analyses from only two patients.

We performed six types of global molecular analysis: solution-based hybrid-capture wholeexome sequencing (WES, n = 320 samples), DNA copy-number profiling by Affymetrix
SNP 6.0 arrays (n = 333), mRNA sequencing (n = 331), microRNA sequencing (n = 323),
DNA methylation profiling (n = 333), and reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) expression
profiling (n = 202). Complete data for all six platforms were available for a core set of 199
samples. TERT promoter mutations at C228T and C250T were assessed by PCR-Sanger
sequencing in a subset of 115 samples. Deep-coverage whole-genome sequencing and lowpass whole-genome sequencing were performed on subsets of 38 samples and 119 samples,
respectively. Clinico-pathological and molecular data associated with each patient are
presented in a patient-centric table (Table S1D); complete methods and results of the
analyses are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. The standard data
package associated with this report (frozen on November 14, 2013) is available at the
GDAC Firehose (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/runs/stddata__2013_11_14/data/SKCM/
20131114). and at Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/skcm_2015/).
Identification of Significantly Mutated Genes

Author Manuscript

WES was performed on paired tumor and germline normal genomic DNA from 318
patients, including primary (n = 58) and metastatic (n = 262) melanomas with a mean exon
coverage of 87×, adequate for detecting a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) at an allelic
fraction of 0.3 with a power of 80% (Carter et al., 2012) (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). In total, we identified 228,987 mutations, including both SNVs and indels.
Targeted validation of 455 SNVs observed in the significantly mutated genes (see below) in
a subset of tumor DNAs (n = 277) revealed an overall validation rate of 96% (see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The mean mutation rate was 16.8 mutations/Mb,
the highest reported for any cancer type thus far analyzed by TCGA (Lawrence et al., 2013)
(Figure S1A) and corroborates findings from other NGS melanoma studies (e.g., Hodis et
al., 2012) and other ultraviolet (UV)-driven skin cancers such as basal and squamous cell
carcinomas (e.g., Jayaraman et al., 2014). Consistent with UV radiation’s mutagenic role in
melanoma, most samples showed a high fraction of C>T transitions at dipyrimidines
(median 77.7%; interquartile range 69.4%–82.6%) and CC>TT mutations (median 3.9%;
interquartile range 2.0%–5.7%) (Figure S1A). We classified samples in which C>T
transitions at dipyrimidine sites accounted for more than 60% or CC>TT mutations more

than 5% of the total mutation burden as possessing a UV signature (Brash, 2015): 44 (76%)
of the 58 primary and 221 (84%) of the 262 metastatic samples had such a signature.

Author Manuscript

Given the statistical challenge of defining significance against a high background mutation
rate, we used two algorithms to define significantly mutated genes (SMGs): MutSig and
InVEx (Hodis et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2014; Lawrence et al., 2013). MutSig takes into
consideration patient-specific mutation frequencies and spectra, mRNA expression levels,
and gene-specific DNA replication times; InVEx controls for patient-specific, gene-specific,
and nucleotide-context-specific mutation probabilities (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). WES analysis by InVEx identified 13 SMGs (Bonferroni p < 0.05, or 20 SMGs
at Q < 0.1) by either functional mutation burden or loss-of-function tests, all of them among
the 42 SMGs identified by MutSig (Q < 0.1) (Tables S2A–S2D and Figure S1B). The 13
SMGs included previously described melanoma oncogenes and tumor suppressors (BRAF,
NRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, and PTEN), as well as recently identified mutated genes (RAC1,
MAP2K1, PPP6C, and ARID2) (Hodis et al., 2012; Krauthammer et al., 2012; Nikolaev et
al., 2012). Our cohort also had sufficient statistical power to annotate several previously
implicated melanoma genes as SMGs (NF1, IDH1, and RB1) (Andersen et al., 1993; Draper
et al., 1986; Lopez et al., 2010). We also identified DDX3X, a putative RNA helicase, as a
novel candidate melanoma SMG (Figures 1A and S1C). SMGs with UV-induced hot-spot
mutations included RAC1 (6.9%) and IDH1 (6.2%) (Figure S1C). The RAC1 hot-spot
mutation has been linked to resistance to BRAF inhibitors (Van Allen et al., 2014; Watson et
al., 2014). Similar to findings in other tumor types, IDH1-mutated samples were enriched in
the high CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) subgroup (Figures S1D–S1G)
(Noushmehr et al., 2010).

Author Manuscript

Additionally, two genes (MRPS31 and RPS27) that encode ribosomal proteins were
identified by MutSig as SMGs. Both possess presumptive UV-induced hot-spot mutations in
their 5′ UTR (in ~5% and ~9% of samples, respectively) (Figure S1H). MRPS31 encodes a
mitochondrial ribosomal protein not previously associated with cancer; RPS27 is a
component of the 40S ribosomal subunit whose overexpression has been reported in
melanoma (Santa Cruz et al., 1997). The recurrent mutation in RPS27 was recently shown to
expand the 5′ TOP element, a motif known to control mRNA translation regulated through
the PI(3)K/AKT and mTOR pathways (Dutton-Regester et al., 2014).
Genomic Classification of Melanoma

Author Manuscript

One of the most significant successes in clinical practice has been the development of
targeted therapies for patients with activating driver mutations (McArthur and Ribas, 2013;
Tsao et al., 2012). We therefore classified melanomas based on identified SMGs and their
distribution in our cohort (n = 318 cases with WES data; described below, Figure 1A, and
Table 1) to create a framework that could be used for personalized therapeutic decisions.
BRAF Subtype
The largest genomic subtype is defined by the presence of BRAF hot-spot mutations. Of the
318, 52% (n = 166) harbored BRAF somatic mutations. Of those, 145 targeted the welldocumented V600 amino acid residue: V600E (n = 124), V600K (n = 18), and V600R (n =

3). The second most frequent BRAF mutation targeted the K601 residue (n = 5). As in
previous reports (Pollock et al., 2003), both BRAF V600 and K601 hot-spot mutations were
anti-correlated with hot-spot NRAS mutations (Fisher’s exact p < 1e–15). In contrast, BRAF
non-hot-spot mutations (including eight exon 11 mutations) co-occurred with RAS (N/H/K)
hot-spot and NF1 mutations (Figures 1B and 1C).
RAS Subtype

Author Manuscript

The second major subtype is defined by the presence of RAS hot-spot mutations, including
known amino acid changes with functional consequences, in all three RAS family members
(N-, K- and H-RAS). Overall, 28% (n = 88) had NRAS somatic mutations. Of those, 86 had
hot-spot mutations, including Q61R (n = 35), Q61K (n = 28), Q61L (n = 11), Q61H (n = 4),
61_62QE > HK (n = 1), G12R/D/A (n = 4), and G13R/D (n = 3). We also identified lessfrequent mutations in other RAS family members, including four hot-spot HRAS (G13D,
G13S, and Q61K [n = 2]) and three KRAS (G12D, G12R, and Q61R) mutations; all were
mutually exclusive with NRAS and BRAF V600 and K601 mutations.
NF1 Subtype

Author Manuscript

The third most frequently observed SMG in the MAPK pathway was NF1, which was
mutated in 14% of samples. More than half of its mutations were predicted to be loss-offunction (LoF) events, including 27 nonsense, 9 splice-site, and 4 frame-shift indels out of
65 mutations (InVEx LoF analysis: p = 1.8e– 11, Q = 9.1e–12) (Figures 1D and 1E). NF1
subtype (n = 28) had the highest mutation prevalence (39 mutations/Mb, more than double
that of the other three subtypes). Since NF1 is a GTPase-activating protein known to
downregulate RAS activity through its intrinsic GTPase activity, LoF mutation of NF1 can
be viewed as an alternative way to activate the canonical MAPK signaling pathway. Indeed,
in this cohort, NF1 was mutated in 38.7% of non-hot-spot BRAF/NRAS melanomas (29/75)
and in ~70% of non-hot-spot BRAF/NRAS samples with a UV-signature (26/38) (Figure
1A). Furthermore, NF1 mutations were anti-correlated with hot-spot BRAF mutations (p =
1.93–9), but not hot-spot RAS mutations (Figure 1A).
Triple Wild-Type Subtype

Author Manuscript

We defined the Triple-WT subtype (n = 46) as a heterogeneous subgroup characterized by a
lack of hot-spot BRAF, N/H/K-RAS, or NF1 mutations. This lack of hot-spot mutations was
not due to lower tumor purity or ploidy, since power calculation taking into account samplespecific purity and ploidy (Carter et al., 2012) showed that our sequencing coverage is
powered to detect sub-clonal mutations at a 6% allelic fraction on average in Triple-WT
subtype (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To identify rare low-frequency driver
mutations in this subtype, we cross-referenced all observed SNVs to recurrently mutated
base pairs (n > 20) in the COSMIC database v60 and identified 11 additional genes with
recurrent COSMIC mutations (Table S2E). Several COSMIC mutations, including known
drivers of uveal melanoma—GNAQ (n = 1) and GNA11 (n = 2), KIT (n = 6), as well as
CTNNB1 (n = 3) and EZH2 (n = 1)—were found in the Triple-WT subtype.

Molecular Characteristics of the Four Genomic Subtypes

Author Manuscript

Clinically, patients in the BRAF subtype were younger than patients in the other subtypes,
while those in the NF1 subtype were significantly older (rank sum p = 0.008). Regardless of
subtype, patients with TP53 mutant melanomas had significantly higher mutation counts and
number of C>T transitions (rank sum p = 1.35 e–05 and p = 1.1 e–05, respectively).
However, no significant difference was observed in post-accession survival (i.e., survival
calculated from date of biospecimen collection/accession to date of last follow-up or death,
see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Therefore, we next explored the molecular
heterogeneity among these genomic subtypes by integrative analyses.
UV Signature

Author Manuscript

We noted that only 30% (14/46) of samples in the Triple-WT subtype harbored a UV
signature, compared to 90.7% of samples with a BRAF hot-spot mutation (136/150), 93.5%
with a RAS (N-H-K) hot-spot mutation (86/92), and 92.9% of the NF1 subtype (26/28)
(Figure S1I) (Fisher’s exact test p = 1e–15). In contrast, Triple-WT samples had more copynumber changes and complex structural arrangements compared to the other groups.
Somatic Copy-Number Alterations

Author Manuscript

We assessed the patterns of somatic copy-number alteration (CNA) across subtypes.
Although global patterns of arm-level alterations were similar, the Triple-WT had
significantly more copy-number segments (Figures S2A and S2B) and was enriched for
focal amplifications targeting known oncogenes. For example, we found significant 4q12
focal amplification containing the oncogene KIT only in the Triple-WT cohort (Figure 2A).
Two other adjacent oncogenes, PDGFRA and KDR (also known as VEGFR2), were
frequently co-amplified with KIT (Figure 2B). We also observed high-level focal CNAs
containing the oncogenes CDK4 and CCND1 (p < 0.01, FDR < 0.05), consistent with
previous studies (Curtin et al., 2005), as well as MDM2 and TERT (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) to
be significantly enriched in Triple-WT melanomas (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, focal
amplifications of BRAF, the melanocyte lineage-specific oncogene MITF (p < 0.01, FDR <
0.05), and the ligand for the co-inhibitory immune checkpoint protein PD-1, PD-L1 gene
(CD274), were observed at significant frequencies in the BRAF mutant subtype (Figures 2,
S2C, and S2D), whereas NRAS amplifications co-occurred in tumors with NRAS mutations
(Figure S2C). CD274 amplifications (which encodes PD-L1) are particularly noteworthy
given the potential clinical value of PD-L1 expression in predicting response to PD-1
pathway inhibitors (Tumeh et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

Structural Rearrangements
To define fusion events, we performed an integrative analysis using copy-number (n = 333),
RNA-seq (n = 331), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data complemented by low-pass
(n = 119) and deep (n = 38) sequencing. In total, 224 candidate fusion drivers were
identified (Table S3A). Although there was only one recurrent fusion (GRM8-CNTNAP2, n
= 2), we discovered a number of melanoma-associated genes recurrently fused to various
gene partners (Figure S2E), including BRAF (ATG7-BRAF and TAX1BP1-BRAF), RAF1
(TRAK1-RAF1, RAF1-AGGF1, and CLCN6-RAF1), and AKT3 (CEP170-AKT3, AKT3-

PLD5, ZEB2-AKT3, and ARHGAP30-AKT3). We also identified three MITF fusions (MITFFOXP1, CADM2-MITF, and FRMD4B-MITF) and three HMGA2 fusions (PCBP2-HMGA2,
TSFM-HMGA2, and SENP1-HMGA2). Eight of the 224 candidate driver fusions (ATG7BRAF, TAX1BP1-BRAF, LBH-FLT4, LCLAT1-EPHA3, TRAK1-RAF1, CLCN6-RAF1,
CPSF4L-ERBB4, and MOBKL1B-EPHB1) possessed a predicted intact kinase domain.
Although additional functional studies are required to determine the role of these fusions in
melanoma, unbiased pathway analyses of candidate fusions suggest biological functions
relevant to melanoma (Tables S3B and S3C).

Author Manuscript

We saw significant enrichment for the 224 predicted fusion drivers in the Triple-WT
subtype (p = 2e–04) (Figure S2F). Using ShatterSeek followed by manual review (see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we identified complex rearrangement events in
38% of samples (45/117) (Table S1D). Like fusion events, complex structural
rearrangements were enriched in the Triple-WT subtype (11/16, Fisher’s exact test p =
0.00098), particularly in those lacking a UV signature (7/7). Taken together with the pattern
of somatic CNAs and the lower frequency of samples possessing a UV signature (~30%),
these results suggest that, unlike other subtypes, other mutational processes that involve
structural rearrangement of the genome drive the malignant phenotype of Triple-WT
melanomas.
TERT Promoter Mutations

Author Manuscript

We confirmed mutually exclusive TERT promoter mutations C228T and C250T (Horn et al.,
2013; Huang et al., 2013) in 23.5% and 40.9% of the 115 samples analyzed, respectively.
Interestingly, only the C228T mutation was associated with elevated TERT mRNA
expression (rank-sum test, p = 0.001) (Figure S2G) and contrasts with glioblastoma (GBM),
in which both mutations were linked to increased expression (Brennan et al., 2013). TERT
promoter mutations were observed in 75.0% (39/52) of BRAF, 71.9% (23/32) of RAS, and
83.3% (10/12) of NF1 subtypes but in only 6.7% (1/15) of Triple-WT (p = 8e–5, Figure
S2H), suggesting an alternative mechanism of TERT activation (e.g., TERT amplification or
rearrangement; see above) in the Triple-WT melanomas.
CIMP Phenotype

Author Manuscript

While a higher frequency of NRAS hot-spot mutations (OR = 2.3, p = 0.003) and a lower
frequency of BRAF hot-spot mutations (OR = 0.4, p = 0.0008) were found in the CIMP
cluster defined by DNA methylation profiles (EEP), the strongest associations of CIMP
were with IDH1 (OR = 4.05, p = 0.005) and ARID2 (OR = 3.5, p = 0.0003) mutations
(Figure S1F), both of which are chromatin-remodeling genes. Those observations suggest
that, despite the intriguing correlations, the CIMP phenotype is not driven by the events
responsible for genotypic subtypes of melanoma.
Signaling Pathways
Classical signaling pathway diagrams suggest that BRAF, RAS (N/H/K), and NF1 subtypes
share common downstream signaling. We analyzed RPPA profiles of 181 cancer-related
total proteins and phosphoproteins in 200 melanoma samples to further assess downstream
signaling among subtypes. Not surprisingly, components of the MAPK, PI(3)K, and

apoptotic signaling pathways were differentially activated by BRAF/RAS(N/H/K)/NF1 driver
mutations (Figures 3 and S3). Although, for example, the upstream phospho-MAP2K1/
MAP2K2 (MEK1/2) S217/S221 was elevated in both BRAF and RAS (N/H/K) hot-spot
mutation subtypes (Figure 3A), the highest relative median activation of phospho-T202/
Y204 MAPK1/MAPK3 (ERK1/2) was observed in the RAS (N/H/K) mutant subgroup
(Figure 3B). As predicted by copy-number analysis, Triple-WT tumors showed the highest
median KIT protein abundance (Figure 3C). In contrast, NF1 mutant melanomas had the
highest median level of CRAF expression, highlighting differential MAPK activation in this
subtype (Figure 3D). Other examples of differential subtype-specific signaling included
higher median levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 in the Triple-WT subtype (Figure
3E) and regulators of insulin signaling (IGFBP2) in BRAF hot-spot mutants (Figure 3F).
Additional proteins involved in the PI(3)K/mTOR and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
pathways were also significantly associated with particular mutation subtypes (Figure S3).

Molecular Pathways—To broaden our view of the common molecular processes
dysregulated in melanoma, we integrated mutation, copy-number, and methylation data to
identify recurrently targeted pathways and signaling interactions involving significantly
altered genes in all samples (n = 318) (Figures S4A–S4D). We manually curated the genetic
alterations by BRAF, RAS (N/H/K), NF1, and Triple-WT subtypes (Figure 4A) and found
that RAS (N/H/K)-MAPK-AKT, RB1/CDKN2A cell-cycle pathways, and MDM2/TP53
apoptosis pathways were altered in 91%, 69%, and 19% of cases, respectively. TP53
mutations were found more frequently in BRAF, RAS, and NF1 tumors, compared to TripleWT, in which MDM2 amplifications were more frequent. Interestingly, of the 49 TP53
mutations identified, 46 (93.9%) were found in UV signature samples. Although CDKN2A/B
alterations were nearly evenly distributed across subtypes, CDK4 and CCND1
amplifications were more frequent in Triple-WTs, and RB1 mutations were detected in a
higher fraction of NF1 subtype tumors. Of the 12 RB1 mutations identified in this study, all
were in UV signature samples. Finally, as previously reported (Pollock et al., 2003), PTEN
mutations and deletions were more frequent in BRAF-mutant melanomas (Figures 4A and
4B), whereas amplification and mRNA overexpression of AKT3 were significantly enriched
in RAS (N/H/K), NF1, and Triple-WT compared to the BRAF subtype (p < 0.05) (Figure
4B).
Transcriptomic Classification of Melanoma

Author Manuscript

We performed consensus hierarchical clustering analysis (TCGA, 2014a) of the 1,500 genes
with the most variant expression levels in 329 samples and identified three robust stable
clusters. Based on the gene function(s) of discriminatory mRNA transcripts, we named the
clusters “immune” (n = 168; 51%), “keratin” (n = 102; 31%), and “MITF-low” (n = 59;
18%) (Figure 5A and Table S4A). Interestingly, post-accession survival of patients with
regionally metastatic tumors was significantly different among the three clusters (p = 0.001,
Figure 5B), suggesting that these transcriptomically defined subclasses may be biologically
relevant and distinct.

“Immune” Subclass

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A significant number of genes overexpressed in this subclass were associated with immune
cell subsets (T cells, B cells, and NK cells), immune signaling molecules, co-stimulatory and
co-inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins, cytokines, chemokines, and corresponding
receptors (Tables S4A–S4B). As 74% (113/152) of samples in the subclass were procured
from regional lymph nodes (Pearson’s chi-square test, p < 0.001), we first assessed whether
high expression of immune-related genes reflected the biology of melanoma-infiltrating
immune cells or a non-specific admixture of “contaminating” adjacent lymphoid tissue in
the samples (Erdag et al., 2012). Specifically, we compared the expression of nine curated
immune gene signatures (comprising 793 genes and detailed in Table S4B) in 172 samples
from lymph nodes and 157 tumors from other tissues (Figures S5A and S5B). Reassuringly,
there was no significant difference in expression of tested immune signatures between the
samples from lymph nodes and non-lymph node tissues (Figure S5A), suggesting that the
transcriptomic features of the immune subclass were not due to contaminating adjacent
lymph node tissue. Patients with regionally metastatic tumors in this subclass showed more
favorable post-accession survival than did those in the other two subclasses (log-rank test, p
= 0.003), in accordance with previous reports of the host immune response in melanoma
(Azimi et al., 2012).
“Keratin” Subclass

Author Manuscript

This cluster was characterized by high expression of genes associated with keratins,
pigmentation, and epithelium, as well as genes associated with neuronal development or
other organ-specific embryologic development (Table S4A). Approximately 74% of primary
melanomas clustered within this group (Pearson’s chi-square test, p < 0.001) and showed
high expression of genes previously reported to be elevated in primary melanomas. Included
were several keratins, kallikreins, and other epidermal genes. However, 25 keratin cluster
samples were derived from regional lymph nodes, suggesting that expression of the
epithelial transcripts was not due solely to admixture of epithelial tissue (such as skin
epidermis) with melanoma tumor tissue, at least for this organ site of procurement; indeed,
keratins and other epithelial markers have been found in some melanoma cell lines (Shields
et al., 2007). Of note, regional metastatic melanomas exhibited worse outcome when
compared with stage-matched samples assigned to the immune or MITF-low cluster (logrank, p = 0.0007) (Figure 5B), supporting the view that the keratin cluster represents, at least
in part, a previously unappreciated but biologically distinct melanoma subtype with adverse
prognosis.
“MITF-Low” Subclass

Author Manuscript

The “MITF-low” cluster was characterized by low expression of genes associated with
pigmentation and epithelial expression (Table S4A), including several MITF target genes
and genes involved in immunomodulation, adhesion, migration, and extra-cellular matrix.
This cluster was significantly enriched with genes preferentially expressed within the
nervous system and/or associated with neuronal development or other organ-specific
embryologic development.

Integrative Molecular Subtypes

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Using the iCluster algorithm (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we next
integrated multiple genomic dimensions (mutation, somatic CNAs, DNA methylation, and
expression) to define molecular subtypes and to unravel hidden associations of the various
subtypes identified in each genomic dimension (Figures 5A, S1D, S5C, and S7 and Data S1
and Table S4). We observed clear associations between the keratin expression subtype, the
CIMP subtype, and a miRNA subgroup (cluster 3), which had a relatively lower frequency
of hot-spot BRAF mutations (Figure S5D, iClust 1). Conversely, “MITF-low” cluster
samples had a higher percentage of BRAF-hot-spot mutations (compared with “keratin” and
“immune” clusters: 66% versus 33% and 45%, respectively; Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.0003
(visualized in Figure S5E). In addition, a lower percentage of tumor samples that were
classified as “MITF-low” had no mutations in either BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 compared with
“keratin” and “immune” clusters (3% versus 21% and 14%, respectively; Fisher’s exact test,
p = 0.006) (Figure S5E). We also discerned associations with the hypomethylation subgroup
and the MITF expression class (Figure S5D, iClust 2). Finally, we observed a low copynumber subgroup, a normal-like methylation profile, and enrichment for tumors possessing
the immune mRNA expression signature, consistent with the presence of lymphocytic
infiltration (Figure S5D, iClust 3).
Clinical Significance of the Immune Transcriptomic Subclass

Author Manuscript

Demonstrating the clinical relevance of molecular classification requires interpretation in the
context of existing clinical practice. As a proof of concept, we addressed the clinical
relevance and potential application of the observation that the “immune” transcriptomic
subclass was associated with improved post-accession survival of patients with regional
metastatic melanoma.

Author Manuscript

Although tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have been associated with favorable prognosis in
primary melanoma (Azimi et al., 2012), such an association has not been investigated in
regional disease. To assess whether our transcriptomic classification of melanoma captures
the biology of tumor-associated lymphocytes, we complemented the clinicopathological
annotation provided by tissue source sites with a standardized pathology review of frozen
section slides by TCGA Analysis Working Group (AWG) dermatopathologists (see Author
Contributions); the density and distribution of melanoma-associated lymphocytes were used
to derive a “lymphocyte score” (LScore), a semiquantitative measure of the number of
lymphocytes in a sample (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Additional
histopathological parameters included percent tumor content, percent necrotic tissue, and
amount of melanin pigment. Melanomas from regional or distant lymph nodes showed
significantly higher LScore than tumors from other tissues (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p =
5.6e–8; Figure 5C). Among the subgroup of regional metastatic melanomas, elevated
LScore was significantly associated with prolonged post-accession survival (Figure 5D),
corroborating prior observations that tumor-associated lymphocytes are a favorable
prognostic factor in melanoma (Bogunovic et al., 2009; Mihm et al., 1996). Remarkably,
there was a striking concordance between high LScore (3–6) and assignment to the immune
subclass (Figure S6A) (Fisher’s exact test, p < 1e–12).

Next, we asked whether transcriptomic features that defined the “immune” cluster are seen
at the protein level by RPPA. In particular, we focused on two immune-related proteins,
LCK and SYK, non-receptor tyrosine kinases commonly associated with T- and Blymphocyte signaling. Interestingly, unsupervised clustering of RPPA data revealed that
LCK and SYK are highly expressed in a subset of samples (Figure S5C) that are enriched
with tumors in the transcriptomic immune subclass and/or that have high LScores (Figure
5E). However, high LCK, but not SYK, protein expression was also strongly associated with
favorable post-accession survival of patients with regionally metastatic tumors (Figure 5F
and data not shown). Tumors with high LScores tended to be assigned to the transcriptomic
immune subclass and also express elevated levels of LCK protein (Figures S6A and S6B).
These three characteristics overlapped considerably, and a combination of the three
predicted mela-noma outcome more accurately than did any one of the features alone (logrank, p = 8.0e–6, post-accession survival in regionally metastatic tumors; Figure S6C). This
observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the three reflect unique (although
overlapping) biological characteristics, each of which confers favorable outcomes in
melanoma.

Author Manuscript

Finally, recognizing that unsupervised cluster analysis of a transcriptomic profile is not
readily applicable to clinical practice, we tested the hypothesis that a bivariate model of
LScore and LCK protein expression level offers a comparable prognostic prediction. Indeed,
tumors with high LScore and high LCK expression were associated with significantly
improved post-accession survival compared with those having low LScore and low LCK
expression (log-rank p = 7.9–5, hazard ratio = 5.5, tumors with both high LScore and LCK
versus both scores low; Figure S6D). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression also
demonstrated that both LScore and LCK expression have independent predictive value in
the two-factor model (Figure S6E). Overall, this integrative analysis suggests that a
combination of LCK protein expression and pathologists’ scoring of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes may be more prognostic for patients with nodal metastases than assessment of
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes alone.

DISCUSSION
We propose here that cutaneous melanomas can be divided into four genomic subtypes,
designated BRAF, RAS (N/H/K), NF1, and Triple-WT. Such a genomic classification
provides a framework for exploring how additional molecular alterations may explain
observed biological and clinical differences among the subtypes. It also provides signposts
for identification of drugable targets and predictive biomarkers, as well as potentially useful
guidance for decisions about therapy.

Author Manuscript

Based on evidence that (1) BRAF/RAS (N/H/K) mutant melanomas are driven, at least in
part, by MAPK signaling (Hodis et al., 2012; Krauthammer et al., 2012); (2) melanomas
lacking NF1 expression are dependent on MAPK signaling and respond to MAPK inhibitors
(Maertens et al., 2013; Nissan et al., 2014); and (3) there are clinicopathologic and
molecular differences among melanomas that do not have hot-spot mutations in BRAF/RAS
but differ with respect to NF1 mutation status, melanoma joins two other RTK/RAS-driven

solid tumor types (GBM and lung adenocarcinoma) analyzed by the TCGA, among which a
subset of these cancers has loss-of-function NF1 mutations (TCGA, 2008, 2014b).

Author Manuscript

We suggest that significantly mutated genes and other molecular alterations identified here,
combined with previously described melanoma-associated genes, are likely to have
important implications for prognosis and therapy (Table 1). For example, we postulate that
patients with BRAF wild-type, NF1 mutant melanomas respond to MEK and/or ERK
inhibitors (Maertens et al., 2013; Nissan et al., 2014; Whittaker et al., 2013), supported by
cell line studies that demonstrate that at least some NF1 mutant cell lines respond to MEK
inhibitors (Ranzani et al., 2015). In the setting of frequently co-occurring NF1 and ARID2
mutations, synthetic lethal strategies targeting chromatin modifiers represent a rational area
for pre-clinical research (Helming et al., 2014). In addition to therapeutic strategies currently
under clinical development, melanomas with RAS (N/H/K) mutations, frequently concurrent
with PPP6C hot-spot mutations, may provide therapeutic opportunities for combinatorial
treatment strategies that include Aurora kinase inhibition (Gold et al., 2014). Previous
studies have shown frequent co-occurrence of BRAF mutations and PTEN mutations or
deletions (Tsao et al., 2012). Here, we showed a higher frequency of amplifications and
overexpression of AKT3 in RAS, NF1, and Triple-WT melanomas, which may provide
additional biomarkers to support the use of combination MEK and PI(3)K/AKT/mTOR
pathway inhibitors in such subtypes. In addition, mutations in PIK3CA (E545K, H1047L)
and AKT1/3 (E17K) in BRAF, as well as RAS (N/H/K) mutant melanoma (Table S2E), may
serve as biomarkers that predict response to the above-mentioned targeted therapies.

Candidate driver events in Triple-WT melanomas provide opportunities for pre-clinical and
clinical efforts to effectively target these molecular aberrations. These include KIT
mutations/amplifications, co-amplified RTKs, PDGFRA and KDR (VEGFR2), and even rare
GNAQ Q209P (n = 1) and GNA11 Q209L (n = 2) mutations (sample IDs: TCGA-ER-A3ES,
TCGA-ER-A3ET, and TCGA-ER-A2NF)—the latter of which, interestingly, co-occur with
hot-spot SF3B1 R625H mutations (n = 2 for co-occurrence with GNA11/Q hot-spot
mutations) in our cutaneous melanoma cohort, but not BAP1 mutations, which are
frequently found in metastatic uveal melanoma (Field and Harbour, 2014). Although GNAQ
and GNA11 hot-spot mutations are common in uveal melanomas, they have also been
reported in blue nevi and primary melanocytic neoplasms of the central nervous system
(Küsters-Vandevelde et al., 2010). Our classification supports the use of imatinib and
dasatinib to treat patients with KIT-mutated/amplified cutaneous melanomas (Carvajal et al.,
2011; Hodi et al., 2008; Lutzky et al., 2008; Terheyden et al., 2010) and consideration of
combination therapies with sorafenib, crenolanib, regorafenib, and pazopanib to target coamplified RTKs, PDGFRA, and KDR (VEGFR2). Triple-WT melanomas with
amplifications of MDM2 and overexpression of BCL2 may respond to inhibitors such as
AMG 232, nutlin-3, and BH3 mimetics, currently in preclinical or clinical development in
melanoma. Such agents may also be beneficial for patients with wild-type TP53 across the
genetic subtypes (Frederick et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2014). Other potentially
actionable mutations include recurrent IDH1 R132 (~6%) and EZH2 Y641 mutations (<1%)
(Table S2E).

Overall, approximately half of all cases were assigned to the “immune” subtype.
Interestingly, the response rate to inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is approximately
one-third (Brahmer et al., 2012; Hamid et al., 2013; Topalian et al., 2012). In our study,
expression of both PD-1 and PD-L1 was significantly higher in “immune” compared to each
of the two other groups (Figure S6F), similar to a recent report showing that pre-existing
CD8+ T cells distinctly located at the invasive tumor margin are associated with
immunohistochemical expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, and was also predictive of response
to pembrolizumab (Tumeh et al., 2014). However, it is important to emphasize that our data
do not prove that the immune subtype represents a population responsive to
immunotherapies.

Author Manuscript

We show that immune infiltration is statistically correlated with more favorable prognosis,
irrespective of genomic subtype. The lack of a genomic correlation with outcome provides a
plausible molecular explanation for the lack of observed preferential anti-tumor responses in
clinical trials employing immune checkpoint blockade, at least in relation to BRAF status
(Ascierto et al., 2014; Robert et al., 2014). Nonetheless, despite these data, the question of
whether specific mutated melanoma antigens are responsible for differences in the degree of
tumor infiltration by lymphocytes is an area of active investigation (Robbins et al., 2013;
Snyder et al., 2014). Our combined RPPA analysis, including exploration of LCK and SYK
proteins that are associated with T cell and B cell signaling effectors, respectively, suggests
that T cell, but not B cell, signaling has prognostic significance. This relevance of T cells,
and in particular effector CD8+ T cells, is congruent with clinical benefit seen with highdose bolus IL-2, a T cell growth factor used as a therapeutic agent for advanced melanoma
(McArthur and Ribas, 2013).

Author Manuscript

Among the cohort of patients in this study with advanced stage III disease (Balch et al.,
2010), high lymphocytic score and immune-associated gene expression was associated with
prolonged post-accession survival, potentially reflecting a clinical benefit of
immunotherapies for stage III melanoma patients (Eggermont et al., 2008; Kirkwood et al.,
1996). Such markers should be considered for further evaluation and potential integration
into future AJCC staging systems and associated prognostic models, as well as for
exploration as a potential predictor of response to adjuvant therapies for stage III disease.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Patients and Biospecimens

Author Manuscript

Eligible patients had a diagnosis of either primary or metastatic cutaneous melanoma or
metastatic melanoma of unknown primary (Balch et al., 2009; Dasgupta et al., 1963), but no
previous systemic therapy (except that adjuvant interferon-α ≥90 days prior was permitted);
the site from which the bio-specimen was collected could not have been previously treated
at any time with radiotherapy. Biospecimens from resected primary and/or metastatic
melanomas were obtained from patients with appropriate informed consent and institutional
review board or ethics board approval. Biospecimens were classified as either primary or
metastatic based on the available clinical and pathological information. Independent
pathological review confirmed that each biospecimen was consistent with melanoma. As
specimens were required to have sufficient mass and quality for downstream molecular

complete methodology for patient eligibility, clinical and pathological data elements,
biospecimen acquisition, and molecular analyte extraction is described in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Data Generation
Data from at least one platform were available for 333 patients. The data types included: (1)
clinical, (2) whole-exome sequencing, (3) DNA copy-number and single-nucleotide
polymorphism array, (4) whole-genome sequencing, (5) RNA-sequencing data, (6) DNA
methylation, (7) reverse-phase protein array, and (8) microRNA sequencing. Details of data
generation and analyses are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. All
data sets are available through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga).

Whole-Genome and Exome-Sequencing Data Analysis
Whole-exome sequencing was performed as previously described (TCGA, 2012). Exome
capture was performed using the Agilent Sure-Select Human All Exon v2.0, 44 Mb kit,
followed by 2 × 76 bp paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Read
alignment and processing were performed using BWA and the Picard and Firehose pipelines
at the Broad Institute. For each file, Picard generates a single BAM file that includes reads,
calibrated quantities, and alignments to the genome. The Firehose pipeline performs quality
control, local realignment, mutation calling, small insertion and deletion identification, and
coverage calculations, among other analyses. Complete details of the pipeline can be found
online at http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga. Whole-genome sequencing methods are
described in detail in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

RNA-Sequencing Data Analysis
Total RNA was converted to mRNA libraries using the lllumina mRNA TruSeq kit,
following the manufacturer’s directions. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq
2000 as previously described (TCGA, 2012). Read mapping, gene expression quantitation,
and identification of fusion transcripts are described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
