Abstract
Uterine leiomyoma is the most common tumor of the female genital tract and the leading cause of hysterectomy. Although progesterone stimulates the proliferation of uterine leiomyoma cells, the mechanism of progesterone action is not well understood. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–cloning approach
to identify progesterone receptor (PR) target genes in primary uterine leiomyoma smooth muscle cells. We
identified 18 novel PR-binding sites, one of which was located 20.5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site
of the Krüppel-like transcription factor 11 (KLF11) gene. KLF11 mRNA levels were minimally downregulated
by progesterone but robustly upregulated by the progesterone antagonist RU486. Luciferase reporter assays
showed significant baseline and RU486-inducible promoter activity in the KLF11 basal promoter or distal
PR-binding region, both of which contained multiple Sp1-binding sequences but lacked classic progesterone
response elements. RU486 stimulated recruitment of Sp1, RNA polymerase II, PR, and the coactivators SRC-1 and SRC-2 to the distal region and basal promoter. siRNA knockdown of PR increased KLF11
expression, whereas knockdown of KLF11 increased leiomyoma cell proliferation and abolished the antiproliferative effect of RU486. In vivo, KLF11 expression was significantly lower in leiomyoma tissues compared with adjacent myometrial tissues. Taken together, using a ChIP-cloning approach, we uncovered
KLF11 as an integrator of PR signaling and proliferation in uterine leiomyoma cells. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1722–30.

Introduction
Uterine leiomyomata are the most common gynecologic
tumors in women of reproductive age. Growing evidence
from basic and clinical studies indicates that progesterone
and the progesterone receptor (PR) play key roles in uterine
leiomyoma growth and development (1). Several investigators have shown an increased concentration of both PR isoforms (PR-A and PR-B) in leiomyoma tissue compared with
adjacent myometrium (2, 3). Mitotic activity in leiomyoma
tissue was also increased relative to the adjacent myometrial
tissue during the luteal phase and after treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (4, 5).
Progesterone suppresses apoptosis and stimulates proliferation of leiomyoma cells in culture, whereas PR modulaAuthors' Affiliation: Division of Reproductive Biology Research,

tors inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis (6–11).
Indeed, RU486 and asoprisnil were shown to reduce leiomyoma volume (12, 13), and antiprogestins have been used
as a therapeutic option for patients with leiomyomata (1).
Taken together, these findings suggest that progesterone
plays an important role in leiomyoma growth; however,
the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the pathologic and therapeutic roles of progesterone and its antagonists in uterine leiomyoma are not well
understood.
Progesterone-regulated gene expression is mediated by nuclear receptors PR-A and PR-B. Only a few cis-elements targeted directly by PR have been identified to date. For
example, progesterone response elements (PRE) have been
identified within the basal promoter regions of the progesterone-regulated genes pepsinogen C, c-myc, insulin-like growth
factor binding protein-1, and MUC1 (14–17). However, the
basal promoters of several other progesterone-responsive target genes lack PREs, including PR, p21, p27, glycodelin, and
the folate receptor type α; these promoters contain Sp1 sites
that seem essential for PR-mediated transcription in in vitro
reporter assays (18–22). Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) cloning and ChIP-on-chip approaches have
successfully identified a large number of estrogen receptor
α (ERα)–binding sites at significant distances from the transcriptional start sites of estradiol-regulated genes (23–26). A

KLF11 as a Novel PR Target Gene

similar genome-wide binding pattern of PR and consequent
regulation of human genes through distant binding sites have
been suspected but not yet shown.
To better understand the effects of progesterone on human uterine leiomyoma growth, we sought to identify a larger number of PR target genes. We used a ChIP-cloning
strategy for unbiased identification of regulatory targets of
progesterone/PR in leiomyoma. Interestingly, among the
cloned targets, endogenous PR was found to bind in intact
cells to a region located 20.5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of the Krüppel-like transcription factor 11
(KLF11) gene. Here, we report that this region may interact
with the basal KLF11 promoter through recruitment of common transcription factors in response to the antiprogestin
RU486. We also showed a potential role for KLF11 in protecting against leiomyoma growth and mechanism for the therapeutic action of antiprogestins.

Materials and Methods
Tissue collection and cell culture. Human uterine leiomyoma and matched myometrium were collected from 56
premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy, following
the protocol approved by the institutional review board for
Human Research of Northwestern University. The subjects
had not received any hormonal treatment during the 6 mo
before surgery. The leiomyoma smooth muscle (LSM) cells
were cultured as previously described (27). Cells used in
these experiments were passaged once or twice.
ChIP and ChIP cloning. We performed the ChIP-cloning
procedure as described previously except that the chromatin
fragments were immunoprecipitated using anti-PR antibody
(Abcam; ref. 25). Antibodies used for standard ChIP included
anti-phosphorylated RNA PolII, anti-Sp1, anti–SRC-2 (Abcam), and anti–SRC-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primers
used for ChIP on SLC7A8 and SOX8 are available upon request. Primers used for ChIP at 20.5 kb upstream of the
KLF11 transcription start site were 5′-GCATGATAGTTTCTTGGGTCAACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTAGGCGATGCTATAGTCCACAG-3′ (reverse). Real-time PCR
primers used for fold enrichment of distal regulatory sites
were identical, and real-time PCR primers for basal promoter
region were 5′-GGTCAAGGACGCATTCCTAA-3′ (forward)
and 5′-GAGAGGGGACCACGCTTATAG-3′ (reverse). In this
instance, real-time PCR was performed using ABI SYBR
Green Master kit (ABI).
RNA preparation and real-time quantitative PCR. Total
RNA from LSM cells and tissues of leiomyoma and matched
myometrium was extracted using Tri-reagent (Sigma-Aldrich).
cDNA was prepared with Superscript III first-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). KLF11, SOX8, SLC7A8, PR, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA
were amplified by real-time PCR using the ABI TaqMan Gene
Expression system (ABI) and the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System. All gene expressions were normalized to
GAPDH.
Plasmids, transfection, and luciferase assays. PR-binding region (−19,369 bp/−21,192 bp) identified by ChIP cloning

for KLF11 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-ATGAGGGACCAACTCGGGAAATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAGGACAACAGGACACTGACTTT-3′ (reverse), and cloned into the
pGL3 promoter vector (Promega). The proximal 5′-flanking
region (−549 bp/+171 bp) was amplified by PCR using
primers 5′-ATGTCACCTAGAACCG-3′ (forward) and 5′CGTGTGCATCGTGCAG-3′ (reverse), and cloned into the
pGL3 basic vector (Promega).
T47D cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transfected with 2 μg reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg PRL-TK-Luc using Fugene HD transfection reagent (Roche). Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle
(ethanol) or RU486 (10−6 mol/L) for 48 h, and cell extracts
were prepared using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Illustrated results are normalized to PRL-TK-Luc using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).
Immunostaining for bromo-2-deoxyuridine. The effect of
KLF11 on cell proliferation was determined by bromo-2deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay as described previously except that BrdUrd (20 μmol/L) was added during
the final 4 h of cell treatment (28). The result was expressed
as the BrdUrd labeling index (percentage of BrdUrd-labeled
cells in total cells counted).
Small interfering RNA. To knock down the expression of
endogenous PR and KLF11, LSM cells were transfected with
PR siRNA or KLF11 siRNA (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Nontargeting control siRNA (Dharmacon) was transfected as a negative control.
Immunoblotting. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (29) using monoclonal anti-PR (kindly provided by Dr. Edwards, Baylor College of
Medicine, Houston, TX), anti-KLF11 (Abcam), and anti–proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; GenScript Corp.) antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed using anti–β-actin
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The intensity of bands was quantified using ImageJ software.
Statistical analysis. Differences between groups were analyzed by Student's t test or one-way ANOVA analysis followed by Fisher's protected least significance difference
test. Significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

Results
Identification of PR genomic targets in human LSM
cells. To identify regulatory regions that recruit PR within
the entire genome of human LSM cells, we performed ChIP
using anti-PR antibody in LSM cells treated with progesterone for 1 hour. Twenty-one cloned fragments were mapped
to the genome. Among these, 17 fragments were localized
within an intron of a gene; two fragments were located 5′
or 3′ to the most proximally located genes; the other two
fragments were mapped to an exon of a gene. Because two
genomic regions were associated with multiple ChIP fragments, a total of 18 novel PR-binding sites were identified
(Supplementary Table S1).
These PR-binding sites were distributed genome-wide to
chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 20 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Interestingly, binding sites were not

distributed evenly between the chromosomes. For example,
four binding sites were located on chromosome 1 and two
sites were located on each of chromosomes 7, 14, 17, and
20, whereas no binding to 11 chromosomes was noted, suggesting specificity for genomic distribution.
Of the 18 novel sites, we identified the 16 genes that had a
PR-binding site within an intron or an exon. We also identified a pair of the most proximal genes that flanked each
of the remaining two PR-binding sites (Supplementary
Table S1). One binding site was located 5′ upstream of both
KLF11 and AILT5830, which are transcribed in opposite directions, whereas the remaining binding site was 3′ downstream of both SOX8 and FLJ32252 genes, also transcribed
in opposite directions (Supplementary Table S1).
We next selected 11 well-characterized genes from Supplementary Table S1 and investigated their progesterone responsiveness. We treated LSM cells for 2 and 4 hours with
progesterone in the presence or absence of the progester-

one antagonist RU486 and measured mRNA levels. Treatment with progesterone in the presence or absence of
RU486 altered mRNA levels in 5 of 11 (45%) genes (Supplementary Table S2). In particular, we observed that SLC7A8
mRNA levels were increased after progesterone treatment,
reaching statistical significance at 4 hours (Fig. 1A). This
increase was blocked by RU486. SLC7A8 encodes a key amino acid transporter protein that may be an important regulator of leiomyoma growth (30). SOX8 mRNA levels were
not affected by progesterone but were downregulated significantly at 2 hours in the presence of RU486 (Fig. 1A). SOX8
encodes a transcription factor that inhibits skeletal muscle
differentiation (31).
Conversely, KLF11 mRNA levels were slightly but significantly downregulated by progesterone treatment. However,
they were robustly and significantly increased by 2.3-fold at
2 hours and 3.3-fold at 4 hours in the presence of RU486
(Fig. 1A). Similarly, mRNA levels of the genes PRDM16 and

PCR. The results shown here

independent ChIP experiments.

mRNA and protein levels by RU486

mRNA levels were determined
from LSM cells treated with vehicle

RU486 for 6 h. The asterisks on
the columns (10−8, 10−7, and

efficiency. D, LSM cells were

expression levels were detected
using real-time PCR. The mean ±
SEM for three independent
experiments is reported.

MAN1C1 were upregulated by RU486 (Supplementary
Table S2). As shown in Supplementary Table S1, PRDM16
encodes a transcription factor that may play an important
role in the leukemogenic transformation of the cells (32),
whereas MAN1C1 plays an important role in N-glycan biosynthesis (33).
The mild but significant downregulation of KLF11 by progesterone was also observed independently in a gene microarray experiment using the Illumina platform; progesterone
treatment for 4 hours downregulated KLF11 mRNA by
16.5% (P < 0.05, data not shown). We also showed that
R5020, a synthetic progesterone agonist, significantly decreased the KLF11 mRNA level by ∼30% (Fig. 1B). R5020
induced a more robust reduction in KLF11 mRNA levels
compared with progesterone (Fig. 1B).
These results suggested that the distant PR-binding modules were functionally active and differentially modulated
progesterone and antiprogestin responsiveness of the genes
identified in the ChIP-cloning screen. We next confirmed the
recruitment of PR to the distant PR-binding sites of three selected genes, SLC7A8, SOX8, and KLF11, and further investigated whether these sites interacted with RNA PolII using a
conventional ChIP assay. Independent pools of immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments from LSM cells treated with
progesterone for 1 hour were analyzed. As shown in
Fig. 1C, PR and RNA PolII were recruited to PR-binding sites
in the SLC7A8, SOX8, and KLF11 genes.
Regulation of KLF11 mRNA and protein levels by RU486
in LSM cells. RU486 and other antiprogestins have been
shown to reduce leiomyoma size in a number of clinical trials
(12, 13). Mechanisms responsible for this therapeutic effect

www.aacrjournals.org

are unknown. KLF11 is a known tumor suppressor (34) and
was significantly upregulated in the presence of RU486 as
shown in Fig. 1A. Therefore, we focused our investigation
on KLF11 regulation and function in LSM cells as a possible
mediator of the therapeutic effects of antiprogestins on
uterine leiomyoma. Cells were treated with different doses
of RU486 (10−10–10−6 mol/L) for 6 hours and KLF11 mRNA
levels were determined. As shown in Fig. 2A, RU486 (10−8–
10−6 mol/L) significantly induced KLF11 expression. RU486
at 10 −6 mol/L also stimulated comparable increases in
KLF11 protein levels after 72 hours of treatment (Fig. 2B).
Next, we knocked down endogenous PR using siRNA to establish a functional role for PR in mediating KLF11 expression in LSM cells. Transfection of LSM cells with PR siRNA
reduced PR mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2C). PR knockdown increased KLF11 mRNA by 2.1-fold compared with control siRNA–transfected cells (Fig. 2D).
Stimulation of KLF11 promoter activity by RU486. To determine whether the novel PR-binding region identified by
ChIP cloning confers promoter activity, we cloned this fragment (−19,369 bp/−21,192 bp) into the pGL3 promoter vector. To determine whether the proximal 5′-flanking region
of KLF11 gene was also involved in RU486-regulated gene
transcription, the −549 bp/+171 bp sequence was cloned into
the pGL3 basic vector. Individual constructs were transfected
into T47D breast cancer cells because this cell line with high
levels of endogenous PR could be transfected reproducibly
with both vectors (21). As shown in Fig. 3A, the 1,823-bp fragment bearing the distal PR-binding region showed significant
promoter-enhancing activity in the absence or presence of
RU486. The basal promoter region also conferred significant

transcriptional activity that was induced by RU486 (Fig. 3B).
These results indicated that both the distal region and basal
promoter of the KLF11 gene have transcriptional regulatory
activity.
Recruitment of transcription factors and steroid receptor coactivators to KLF11 basal promoter and distal PRbinding region. As the PR-binding region is located 20.5 kb
upstream of the KLF11 transcription start site, we sought to
elucidate whether this distal region was associated with the
basal transcriptional multimeric complex. There did not
seem to be any classic, palindromic PRE consensus sequences in either the basal promoter or the 20.5-kb distal
PR-binding region. However, we found several half PREs in
the distal region and several GC-rich Sp1 sites in both regions, and hypothesized that ligand-bound PR may associate
with Sp1 and regulate KLF11 expression by mediating an interaction between the distal and basal regulatory sites. To
test this hypothesis, we designed primers flanking the basal
promoter and the distal region. We then evaluated simultaneous recruitment of RNA PolII, Sp1, and PR to the distal
PR-binding region and the basal promoter of KLF11 using
real-time PCR.
We also characterized whether RU486 stimulated KLF11
expression through recruiting coactivators to its basal promoter and the distal PR-binding region. It was reported that
PR action selectively required the steroid receptor coactivator SRC-3 in breast; in contrast, it required SRC-1 as a coactivator in uterus (35). SRC-1 and SRC-2 have a similar pattern
of expression that is distinct from the pattern of expression
of SRC-3, indicating that these two proteins play cooperative
roles in regulating steroid hormone action in the murine
uterus (36). We thus evaluated the recruitment of SRC-1
and SRC-2 to KLF11 basal promoter and the distal regulatory
region.
In the basal promoter region, RU486 significantly increased the association of RNA PolII, Sp1, PR (Fig. 4A),
SRC-1, and SRC-2 (Fig. 4B) with this region of the KLF11
gene. In the distal regulatory region, however, RU486 significantly induced the recruitment of only SRC-2 to this region
(Fig. 4B). We observed trends that RU486 enhanced the interaction of RNA PolII, Sp1, PR, and SRC-1 to the distal regulatory region, but none of them reached statistical significance
(Fig. 4A and B).
To further verify that PR is necessary for the recruitment
of transcriptional complexes, we determined the effects of PR
knockdown on SRC-2 recruitment in the presence or absence
of RU486. As expected, RU486 induction of PR recruitment to
both the distal region and the basal promoter was abolished
by PR siRNA (data not shown). PR knockdown significantly
reduced the baseline recruitment of SRC-2 to the distal region but did not cause significant change of its association
with the basal promoter region (Fig. 4C). RU486-induced
SRC-2 recruitment to the basal promoter was decreased robustly by ∼2.4-fold in the presence of PR siRNA, whereas PR
siRNA strikingly decreased RU486-induced SRC-2 binding to
the distal region by ∼7-fold (Fig. 4C).
These data suggest that RU486 regulates KLF11 expression
through simultaneous recruitment of PR, its coactivators,

and general transcription factors to its basal promoter and
distal regulatory region. These findings also suggest that
the distal PR-binding region regulates KLF11 expression
through an interaction with the basal transcriptional multimeric complex.
Knockdown of KLF11 is associated with increased LSM
proliferation. We performed knockdown of endogenous
KLF11 to investigate how it may be involved in progesteroneor RU486-regulated LSM cell proliferation, as indicated by
PCNA level and the rate of BrdUrd incorporation. Real-time
PCR analysis confirmed that KLF11 siRNA reduced endogenous KLF11 expression by ∼80% (Fig. 5A). As shown in
Fig. 5B, KLF11 siRNA or the pure progesterone agonist
R5020 decreased KLF11 protein levels and increased PCNA
levels. In contrast, RU486 decreased PCNA levels and knockdown of KLF11 blunted this inhibitory effect (Fig. 5C). Alterations in LSM cell proliferation were verified by the BrdUrd
incorporation assay. Figure 5D shows that RU486 significantly decreased the BrdUrd labeling index from 7.1% to 3.8%.
Knockdown of KLF11 increased the BrdUrd labeling index
to 17.6% (P < 0.01, compared with vehicle-treated and control
siRNA–transfected cells), even in the presence of RU486

(16.3%). These results suggest that regulation of LSM cell
proliferation by progesterone agonists or antagonists may
be mediated, at least in part, by KLF11.
KLF11 expression in leiomyoma and matched myometrial tissues. To understand the in vivo relevance of progesterone and antiprogestin-regulated KLF11 expression in
leiomyoma, we analyzed mRNA and protein levels of KLF11
in human leiomyoma and matched adjacent normal myometrial tissues using real-time PCR and Western blot. KLF11
mRNA levels in 17 subjects were lower in leiomyoma than
in myometrial tissues, and only one subject had higher
KLF11 mRNA levels in leiomyoma compared with myometrial tissues. As shown in Fig. 6A, the mean expression level
of KLF11 in leiomyoma tissues was approximately half of
that of matched myometrial tissues (n = 18, P < 0.001). Similarly, mean KLF11 protein level was significantly lower in
leiomyoma than matched myometrial tissues from six subjects (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
A significant volume of work has focused on identifying
estrogen receptor binding sites using computational genomics (37–39), promoter microarrays (26), CpG island libraries

(40), ChIP cloning (25, 26), and ChIP-on-chip methods (24).
Although progesterone has important and complex effects
on the female reproductive tract, comparatively little is
known about genome-wide PR-binding sites. Using ChIPcloning technology and progesterone-responsive primary
leiomyoma cells, we identified 18 novel PR-binding sites,
which corresponded to 20 genes proximal to these sites. Specifically, we showed that RU486 enhanced recruitment of PR,
its coactivators SRC-1 and SRC-2, as well as key general transcription factors RNA PolII and Sp1, to both distal PR-binding region and basal promoter of the KLF11 gene and
induced its expression. We also found that KLF11 is a robust
suppressor of leiomyoma growth.
We did not identify any PR-binding sites within a basal
promoter. Five percent of PR-binding sequences were located
in far distal 5′ regions, 5% were in 3′ regions, and 80% of
binding sites lay within an intron of a gene. Considering that
introns comprise ∼40% of the genome, this suggests a higher
affinity of PR to coding regions of its target genes. This is
consistent with our previous findings indicating that 46%
of ERα binding sites were located within an intron of a gene
in breast cancer cells (25).
None of the reported PR target genes was pulled out in this
study (14–22). Some unavoidable limitations of the current

LSM cells were exposed to RU486 (10−6 mol/L) or vehicle (ethanol) for 1 h. DNA interaction with transcription factors and coactivators was detected
by immunoprecipitation with an anti-phosphorylated RNA PolII, anti-PR, anti-Sp1 (A), anti–SRC-1, or anti–SRC-2 (B) antibody. Nonspecific rabbit IgG was
used as a negative control. Real-time PCR was used to detect the fold enrichment of these transcription factors and coactivators using primers
flanking the distal PR-binding and proximal promoter regions. The enrichment was normalized by IgG and calculated as fold increase compared with
vehicle-treated cells. The results are shown as mean ± SEM of triplicates from a representative experiment reproduced using cells from four subjects.

above. The results are shown as mean ± SEM of triplicates from a representative experiment reproduced using cells from three subjects.

ChIP-cloning strategy, such as the affinity of the antibody used
to pull down chromatin and the on-and-off interaction pattern
of transcription factors with DNA, may cause the incomplete
cloning of all target genes (25, 26, 41, 42). The low endogenous
PR levels in cultured LSM cells may also account for the low
number of PR-binding sites cloned in this study (43).
Regulation of half of the genes located proximately to
these distant PR-binding sites by progesterone or RU486 suggested that these sequences are functionally active. PRbinding fragments located distal to genes or within introns
might function through long-range interactions that involve
looping of chromatin to bring the regulatory elements within
the proximity of basal promoters.
Both proximal and distal regulatory regions of the KLF11
gene recruited not only PR and Sp1 but also RNA PolII upon
RU486 treatment. Various models have been proposed to explain how a distal enhancer communicates with a proximal
promoter: the looping, the tracking, and the linking models
(44, 45). With regard to the distal-proximal communication
of the KLF11 gene, our data support a looping model. We
plan to use a chromosome conformation capture assay to investigate whether the KLF11 distal region and proximal promoter physically interact in intact cells.
RU486 stimulated the basal promoter activity but not the
enhancer function of the distal region. RU486 also enhanced
PR binding to the basal promoter but not to the distal region.
The distal region, however, exhibits significant basal enhancer function, basal PR-binding activity, and RU486-induced

SRC-2 recruitment, which is PR dependent (Fig. 4C). Taken
together, these findings are suggestive that the major function of the distal PR-binding site is the stabilization of the
RU486/PR–dependent enhancer complex at the KLF11 promoter. It seems that an interaction between the basal promoter and the distal PR-binding region would be necessary
for RU486-dependent regulation of KLF11 expression.
We found that, at least for the target genes studied here,
RU486 was a much more robust regulator compared with
progesterone. Knockdown of PR or treatment with RU486
significantly increased KLF11 expression, whereas the native
progesterone hormone minimally suppressed its expression.
The synthetic progesterone agonist R5020, however, markedly suppressed KLF11 levels (Figs. 1B and 5B). The difference
between the effects of progesterone and R5020 may be due to
possible rapid metabolization of progesterone in these cells.
Consistent with the notion that coactivators play major
roles in determining PR activity (46), we found that, through
interacting with PR, RU486 enhanced the binding of SRC-1
and SRC-2 to the basal promoter and the distal PR-binding
region, which gave rise to gene induction. The function of
RU486 as an inducer of gene transcription is not without precedent. Shatnawi and colleagues showed that RU486 can
stimulate expression of genes encoding folate receptor type
α, p21, and p27 in a specific promoter context that has G/Crich Sp1 binding elements but no classic PRE sites (22). In
line with this observation, we found that both distal PR-binding region and the basal promoter of the KLF11 gene, with

KLF11 as a Novel PR Target Gene

Figure 6. mRNA and protein levels of KLF11 in human leiomyoma and
matched myometrial tissues. A, 36 samples from 18 subjects were
analyzed for mRNA; 18 samples were obtained from leiomyomas and
18 from adjacent myometrial tissues. To allow comparisons of data
obtained from samples from different subjects, mRNA levels in the
myometrial tissues were normalized to 1. B, 12 samples from six subjects
were analyzed for KLF protein levels. Immunoblot densities were
quantified with Image J software. M, myometrial tissue; L, leiomyoma

multiple G/C-rich Sp1 binding sites in both regions, could recruit PR. Additionally, our data suggest that the biological
activity of PR liganded by mixed antagonist/agonist compounds is complex and may depend on the promoter context
and the availability of coregulators.
KLF11 is a transcription factor that serves as a downstream effector of transforming growth factor β–dependent
signaling. It is downregulated in human cancers, inhibits cell

growth in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits neoplastic transformation (34). Consistent with these reports, we found that
KLF11 expression was significantly downregulated in leiomyoma tissues compared with adjacent matched myometrial
tissues. Moreover, KLF11 inhibited LSM cell growth. Although the mechanism involved in KLF11-regulated cell proliferation needs to be further clarified, our studies provide an
initial insight into the mechanism by which progesterone or
RU486 regulates leiomyoma growth and development. Given
that progesterone exerts a number of essential functions in
inhibition of estrogen-dependent endometrial carcinogenesis
and promotion of breast cancer development, it is tempting
to explore the regulation and function of KLF11 in these malignancies (47–49).
In summary, using an unbiased approach, we uncovered
KLF11 as a novel PR target responsive to progesterone antagonist RU486 in LSM cells. KLF11 mediated the antiproliferative effects of RU486 in leiomyoma cells. These studies reveal
a potential mechanism underlying the modulation of progesterone- and antiprogestin-regulated differentiation and proliferation in LSM cells. The PR-dependent downregulation of
KLF11 expression in LSM cells may represent a missing link
in steroid signaling pathways that explains the pathogenesis
of uterine leiomyoma. Furthermore, the identification of direct targets of KLF11 will be important to elucidate its role in
uterine leiomyoma biology.
