ABSTRACT
Background: Blood pressure (BP) control is one of the most important treatments
of Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The comparative efficacy
of antihypertensive treatments in ADPKD patients is inconclusive.
Methods: Network meta-analysis was used to evaluate randomized controlled
trials (RCT) which investigated antihypertensive treatments in ADPKD. PubMed,
Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane Collaboration were searched. The primary outcome
was estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Secondary outcomes were serum
creatinine (Scr), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP
(DBP), mean artery pressure (MAP) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI).
Results: We included 10 RCTs with 1386 patients and six interventions:
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), Angiotensin II receptor blocker
(ARB), combination of ACEI and ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), β-blockers and
dilazep. There was no difference of eGFR in all the treatments in both network and
direct comparisons. No significant differences of Scr, SBP, DBP, MAP, and LVMI were
found in network comparisons. However, ACEI signiﬁcantly reduced SBP, DBP, MAP
and LVMI when compared to CCB. Significantly increased UAE was observed in CCB
compared with ACEI or ARB. Bayesian probability analysis found ARB ranked first in
the surrogate measures of eGFR, UAE and SBP.
Conclusions: There is little evidence to detect differences of antihypertensive
treatments on kidney disease progression in ADPKD patients. More RCTs will be
needed in the future. Use of ARB may be an optimal choice in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION

hypertension have faster and greater annual rates of
total kidney volume (TKV) growth, and an increased
prevalence of cardiovascular complications when
compared with the normotensive patients. Healthcare
for ADPKD mainly focuses on hypertension to reduce
mortality and morbidity. Currently, blood pressure (BP)
control is one of the most important clinical treatments of
ADPKD.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD) is characterized by continuous enlargement
of kidney cysts. ADPKD is the most common hereditary
nephropathy with prevalence from 1/1000 to 1/400 [1].
ADPKD patients develop hypertension early, which
increases the renal progression. ADPKD patients with

The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS)
plays an important role in hypertension pathogenesis in
ADPKD [2]. RAAS inhibitors (RASI) include Angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin
II receptor blocker (ARB). RASIs have been proved to
slow renal progression in non-diabetes chronic kidney
disease (CKD), and are widely used in clinical practice
of ADPKD. Besides, calcium channel blockers (CCBs),
β-blockers, dilazep and the diuretics also were used
in ADPKD with hypertension [3-5]. There was no
difference in renal function between ACEI and placebo
[6]. Kanno et al. [7] found CCB showed higher creatinine
clearance compared with ACEI. However, a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) found renal function was similar
between amlodipine and enalapril [8]. Recently, the Halt
Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease studies (HALTPKD) [1,2] observed a negative effect of the combination
of ACEI and ARB on renal function compared with ACEI
monotherapy.
Each RCT just contained only two or three drugs. It
is hard to get a head-to-head outcome comparing the drugs
of interest or get all the drugs to integrate some specific
effects together [9]. This study aimed to use network and
traditional meta-analysis to assess the direct and indirect
effects of antihypertensive treatments in ADPKD.

studies, four treatments, Supplemental Figure 2). There
was no decreased Scr with ACEI or ARB when compared
with β-blocker or CCB either in the consistency model or
in the inconsistency model. Table 4 showed the network
comparisons for the UAE (seven studies, five treatments,
Supplemental Figure 3). UAE in ACEI, ARB, ACEI+ARB
and β-blocker did not differ, but UAE tended to be higher
in CCB. There was increased UAE with CCB when
compared with all the RASI treatments and β-blocker in
the consistency model. However, we did not find increased
UAE in CCB than β-blocker in the inconsistency model
(MD 169.66, 95% CI -11.59, 351.46). Table 5 showed
the network comparisons for the SBP (seven studies,
five treatments, Supplemental Figure 4). No significant
difference was observed in all the treatments either in the
consistency model or in the inconsistency model. Table 6
showed network comparisons for the DBP (seven studies,
five treatments, Supplemental Figure 5). DBP in all the
treatments did not differ. Table 7 showed the network
comparisons for the MAP (five studies, five treatments,
Supplemental Figure 6). No significant difference was
observed in all the treatments either in the consistency
model or in the inconsistency model. Table 8 showed the
network comparisons for the LVMI (four studies, five
treatments, Supplemental Figure 7). LVMI lowering effect
was similar in all the treatments either in the consistency
model or in the inconsistency model.
In direct comparisons of the primary outcome, the
results were almost similar to the network comparisons.
There were no statistical difference in the eGFR across
the following comparisons (Figure 4): ACEI vs. placebo
(one study, 61 participants, MD -8.00, 95% CI -18.05,
2.05, P=0.12); ACEI vs. β-blocker (two studies, 65
participants, MD -5.39, 95% CI -25.96, 15.17, P=0.61),
ACEI vs. CCB (one study, 24 participants, MD -13.00,
95% CI -27.85, 1.85, P=0.09), ARB vs. CCB (one study,
31 participants, MD 6.30, 95% CI -8.49, 21.09, P=0.40),
ACEI vs. ARB (one study, 32 participants, MD 3.40, 95%
CI -15.91, 22.71, P=0.78), Dilazep vs. placebo (one study,
22 participants, MD 2.24, 95% CI -8.05, 12.53, P=0.67),
and ACEI+ARB vs. ACEI (two studies, 41 participants,
MD -0.63, 95% CI -4.93, 3.68, P=0.61).
Figure 5 showed the direct comparisons of Scr. No
significant difference was observed in direct comparisons
of Scr. Figure 6 showed the direct comparisons of UAE.
Nutahara et al. [3] reported ARB signiﬁcantly decreased
UAE (24 participants, MD -238.00, 95% CI -394.61,
-81.39, P=0.003) compared with CCB. Ecder et al. [8]
showed that the ACEI decreased UAE significantly
compared to the CCB (24 participants, MD -134.00,
95% CI -176.01, -91.99, P<0.00001). Furthermore, the
ARB was associated with lower UAE compared with
the ACEI (one study, 20 participants, MD -22, 95% CI
-28.20, -15.80, P<0.00001). Figure 7 showed the direct
comparisons of SBP. SBP is lower after the treatment of
ACEI than the CCB (one study, 24 participants, MD -5.00,

RESULTS
Ten RCTs with 1,386 participants were included
after assessment of 45 full-text articles and 197 records
[1-8,10-15]. Electronic searching process was shown in
the ﬂowchart (Figure 1). Eight trials were two-grouped,
and two trials were four-grouped. The network of included
treatment comparisons was shown in Figure 2. ACEIs
were the most frequently studied agents. The baseline
characteristics were summarized in Table 1. The mean
follow-up time was about four years (range 0.5–8 years).
Male/female proportion was balanced in all trials. The
hypertension criteria in the studies was > 140/90 mm Hg.
Two studies [6,15] divided patients into hypertension and
normal BP groups.
The overall risk of bias of the included studies
was shown in Figure 3. Random sequence generation
was adequate in two studies. 60% studies did not present
adequate blinding. Only three studies used intention-totreat analyses. Predeﬁned endpoints were reported fully
in four studies.
Network comparisons for primary outcome eGFR
were shown in Table 2. There was no difference of eGFR
in all the treatments (seven studies, five treatments,
Supplemental Figure 1). There was no increased eGFR
with ACEI, ARB, or ACEI+ARB when compared with
β-blocker or CCB either in the consistency model or in
the inconsistency model.
Table 3 showed network comparisons for the Scr. No
significant difference was found in all the treatments (five

comparisons of DBP. DBP is also lower after the treatment
of ACEI than the CCB (one study, 24 participants, MD
-3.00, 95% CI -5.40, -0.60, P=0.01). However, the ACEI
significantly increased the DBP compared to the β-blocker
(one study, 37 participants, MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.35, 1.65,
P=0.002). Figure 9 showed the direct comparisons of
MAP. MAP is lower in the treatment of ACEI compared
with the CCB (one study, 24 participants, MD -3.00, 95%

CI -5.40, -0.60, P=0.007) and the placebo (one study, 61
participants, MD -5.00, 95% CI -6.29, -3.71, P<0.00001).
Figure 10 showed the direct comparisons of LVMI. LVMI
was lower after the treatment of ACEI compared with
the CCB (one study, 69 participants, MD -27.00, 95% CI
-43.07, -10.93, P=0.001).
Then we performed direct comparisons between
the rigorous BP control group (target < 120/80 mmHg)
and the standard BP control group (target 120/80-140/90

associated with a greater decrease in LVMI (three studies,
517 participants, MD -14.56, 95% CI -27.06, -2.06,

comparisons. Sensitivity analysis of direct comparisons by
excluding each study one by one was consistent with the
former results. Heterogeneity of direct comparisons was
high in the rigorous BP vs. standard BP group, because the
included studies used log transformations in the results.
Heterogeneity in the network comparisons was mainly
from the ACEI-ARB-CCB loop, so we checked the
heterogeneity through the node-splitting (Table 10). There
was no significant heterogeneity in the node-splitting.

Compared with β-blocker or CCB, RASIs did not show
different effects on the renal function. ACEI was not
associated with significantly protective effects on eGFR
and UAE when compared with placebo. However, ACEI
signiﬁcantly decreased SBP, DBP, MAP and LVMI when
compared with CCB. Significantly increased UAE was
observed in CCB compared with RASI treatments. No
significant outcome was found in Dilazep compared with
placebo. The rigorous BP control was associated with
lower LVMI than the standard BP control. ARB may be
relatively the most suitable treatment for eGFR, UAE and
SBP in ADPKD.
RASIs are the first-line treatments for hypertension
in ADPKD till now [16]. However, little beneﬁcial
effect of RASIs in renal function was found in ADPKD
patients in the past [17]. Therapeutic effects of RASI in
renal function might be limited due to massive cystic
involvement. EGFR in the majority of ADPKD patients
remained steady until the late stage of the disease [18].
Combination of ACEI and ARB which was supposed
to solve the compensatory feedback showed similar

DISCUSSION
This study provided evidences for the
antihypertensive treatments from 10 RCTs evaluating
six interventions in adult patients with ADPKD. Overall,
network comparisons and direct comparisons both
indicated there was currently insufficient evidence of
an association between lowering BP and the surrogate
measures of kidney.
All the treatments did not differ in eGFR, Scr,
SBP, DBP, MAP, and LVMI in network comparisons.

treatment effects of eGFR and TKV when compared with
the ACEI monotherapy [1, 2].
UAE reflects the level of glomerular proteinuria,
which is considered as a marker of glomerular injury [19].
ACEI is widely used in CKD to reduce the albuminuria
mainly through lowering the intra-glomerular pressure
[20]. Protective effects of ACEI were almost found in
patients with chronic glomerulonephritis or proteinuria >
2 g/24h which did not always happen in ADPKD [21].

ADPKD patients were always accompanied with low
levels of UAE (<2 g/24h). Therefore the anti-albuminuria
effect of the ACEI still need large-scale studies to prove.
CCB was associated with increased UAE than
RASIs [3, 8, 10]. We noticed that the CCB used in the
trials was amlodipine (L-type CCB). CCBs varied in their
effects of glomerular arterioles. T- or N-channel receptors
mainly existed on the afferent and efferent arteriole, while
L-channel receptors predominantly existed on the afferent

arteriole. T-/N-channel blockade led to a reduction of
intra-glomerular pressure and accordingly decreased
UAE levels, while blockade of L-channel receptors led
to an increase of UAE [22]. On the other hand, cytosolic
Ca2+ depletion caused by PKD1/2 mutation could activate
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal pathway
and accelerate cystic proliferation in ADPKD [23,24].
CCB might aggravate the Ca2+ depletion of the tubules
and activate the cAMP pathway. However, this hypothesis
needed to be testified.
Β-blockers treatment was limited and uncertain
according to the existing outcomes. Β-blockers could
inhibit RAAS activation by suppressing renin release.
Evidence about β-blockers in ADPKD still needs more
studies to prove.
LVMI is known as cardiovascular risk factor for
morbidity or mortality in ADPKD patients [19]. Left
ventricular hypertrophy frequently occurs in ADPKD

patients with hypertension. LVMI decrease of hypertensive
patients could bring benefits in reduced cardiovascular risk
and mortality. Only rigorous BP control was found to be
associated with obvious decline in LVMI compared with
the standard BP control. Moreover, the HALT-PKD study
found rigorous BP control could slow TKV significantly
in the patients with early ADPKD [1, 2]. However, the
eGFR and the UAE were not significant in the rigorous

There were few data on patient relevant endpoints,
such as end stage renal disease, need for dialysis/
transplantation and mortality in addition to adverse drug
effects. Zeltner et al. [4] reported no difference between
ACEI vs. β-blocker in the need for dialysis/transplantation
and the risk of cardiovascular events. Nutahara et al. [3]
reported no difference between ARB vs. CCB in the risk
of doubling of Scr.
This study had several limitations. First, the sample

MATERIALS AND METHODS

size of included studies was scant. Therefore, conclusions
of eGFR and secondary outcomes were uncertain.
Secondly, most of the ADPKD patients were prescribed
with combination antihypertensive drugs. Our results
were influenced inevitably by mixed drug effects. Thirdly,
safety endpoints were poorly deﬁned in included studies.
Moreover, this study could not assess subgroup analysis
by different ADPKD genotypes (PKD1&PKD2) with
different speed of renal progression.
In conclusion, this network meta-analysis is
underpowered to detect differences of antihypertensive
treatments on kidney progression in ADPKD patients.
More RCTs and research about T-/N- type CCBs will be
needed in the future. Use of ARB in clinical practice may
be an optimal choice.

Search strategy and selection criteria
We (X.C. and D.B.) searched PubMed, Embase,
Ovid, and Cochrane Collaboration (published up to
May, 2015) with the following terms: “angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors”, “ACEIs”, “ACE
inhibitors”, “angiotensin receptor blockers”, “ARBs”,
angiotensin receptor antagonists”, “beta-blockers”,
“β-blockers”, “beta-receptor antagonist”, “beta adrenergic
antagonists”, “calcium antagonists”, “CCBs”, “calcium
channel blockers”, “diuretics”, and the names of specific
medications. The references of relevant reviews and
clinical studies were checked in case of missed articles.
We also searched the Google Scholar and clinical trials
website.

assessment

FUNDINGS
This study was supported by China Postdoctoral
Science Foundation funded project, and National Natural
Science Foundation of China (30900692, 81370844).

Two authors (X.C. and Z.C.) independently checked
the included studies to extract the relevant data and assess
study bias/risk. Discrepancy was settled by discussion. We
evaluated the bias/risk of the included trials by using the
Cochrane Risk of Bias Scale [25]. The primary outcome
was estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL/min
or mL/min/1.73 m2). Secondary outcomes were serum
creatinine (Scr, mg/dL), urinary albumin excretion (UAE,
mg/d or mg/g), systolic blood pressure (SBP, mm Hg),
diastolic blood pressure (DBP, mm Hg), mean artery
pressure (MAP, mm Hg), left ventricular mass index
(LVMI, g/m2).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
All the authors have no conflict of interest. The
results presented in this paper have not been published
previously.

Statistical analysis
The meta-analysis was carried out according with the
PRISMA extension statement for reporting of systematic
review and network meta-analysis [26]. Heterogeneity was
measured through Q test and I2 statistics [27]. I² < 25%
was considered as low and I² > 75% as high. We estimated
the mean difference (MD) with 95% conﬁdence interval
(CI) for the continuous calculations in the random effects
model. Sensitivity analysis was estimated by the influence
analysis which excluded each study to check the stability.
Network meta-analysis was performed by a
Bayesian Markov Chain Morte Carlo method. Network
meta-analysis needs to assume transitivity which holds
when all direct comparisons between drugs have similar
distribution of effect modiﬁers. The effect modiﬁers in
this study included the BP at baseline, the level of eGFR,
UAE, Scr and LVMI. All indirect treatment comparisons
were taken together to get an integrated estimate of the
included treatments. Different outcomes between direct
and indirect evidences suggested that the assumption of
transitivity might not depend. Included trials were grouped
into six comparison categories: ACEI, ARB, ACEI+ARB,
β-blocker, dilazep and CCB. Evaluation of inconsistency
used the node-splitting. Network meta-analysis was
calculated in both consistency and inconsistency models.
Ranking of the drugs in each outcome was measured
by Bayesian probability analysis. Software used were
