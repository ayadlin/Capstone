Abstract
Epigenetic silencing of genes in association with aberrant
promoter DNA hypermethylation has emerged as a significant
mechanism in the development of human cancers. Such genes
are also often targets of the polycomb group repressive
complexes in embryonic cells. The polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2) has been best studied in this regard. We
now examine a link between PRC1 and cancer-specific gene
silencing. Here, we show a novel and direct association
between a constituent of the PRC1 complex, CBX7, with gene
repression and promoter DNA hypermethylation of genes
frequently silenced in cancer. CBX7 is able to complex with
DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes, leading us to
explore a role for CBX7 in maintenance and initiation of gene
silencing. Knockdown of CBX7 was unable to relieve suppression of deeply silenced genes in cancer cells; however, in
embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, CBX7 can initiate stable
repression of genes that are frequently silenced in adult
cancers. Furthermore, we are able to observe assembly of
DNMTs at CBX7 target gene promoters. Sustained expression
of CBX7 in EC cells confers a growth advantage and resistance
to retinoic acid–induced differentiation. In this setting,
especially, there is increased promoter DNA hypermethylation
for many genes by analysis of specific genes, as well as through
epigenomic studies. Our results allow us to propose a
potential mechanism through assembly of novel repressive
complexes, by which the polycomb component of PRC1 can
promote the initiation of epigenetic changes involving
abnormal DNA hypermethylation of genes frequently silenced
in adult cancers. [Cancer Res 2009;69(15):6322–30]

Introduction
Epigenetic silencing in association with promoter DNA hypermethylation is a mechanism by which tumor suppressor genes
(TSG) are inactivated in adult cancer (1, 2). The mechanisms that
underlie the targeting of such key genes for DNA hypermethylation
remain poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that a large
group of genes silenced in association with aberrant promoter DNA

hypermethylation in cancer are frequent targets of the PcG
repressive complexes in normal and neoplastic embryonic cells
(3–5). These studies suggest a stem cell origin for cancer in that
silencing of genes in adult cancer are linked to the epigenetic
control of stem/precursor cell gene expression patterns regulated
by PcG proteins. However, a direct link has not yet been
established.
PcG proteins are typically found as constituents of one of several
complexes, including the polycomb repressive complex 2/3 (PRC2/
3) or PRC1 (6, 7). The PRC2 complex contains the histone
methyltransferase EZH2, which can catalyze the trimethylation of
H3K27, which can then serve as a docking site for the PRC1
complex (8). EZH2 was recently implicated in silencing of
previously identified PRC2 target genes (9) and found to associate
with DNA methylation machinery (10). Additional studies, however,
showed that knockdown of EZH2 does not usually reexpress DNA
hypermethylated genes in cancer (11, 12). The PRC1 complex
contains several PcG proteins, including a polycomb component
that contains a chromodomain, which can interpret histone
modifications associated with gene silencing (13). Whereas
polycomb is encoded by a single gene in Drosophila, there are
many polycomb family members in mammalian cells, including
CBX7 (6, 7).
Recent studies suggest that CBX7 may play an important role
in tumorigenesis. CBX7 was identified in a functional screen for
genes involved in senescence bypass (14), at least partially via
repression of expression of the TSG, p16 (14, 15). CBX7 has
also been shown to initiate lymphomagenesis and cooperate with
c-myc in tumor progression in vivo (16). Analysis of the CBX7
chromodomain showed that this protein can associate with
repressive histone modifications, including dimethylated and
trimethylated H3K9, as well as trimethylated H3K27 (17).
Together, these studies suggest that a CBX7-containing complex
may possess the ability to read histone modifications found in
promoters of key genes, including those susceptible to cancerspecific DNA methylation (3, 4, 18).
In this study, we have explored the link between PRC1
and cancer-specific gene silencing. We have found that CBX7
can exist in a complex with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)
enzymes in cancer cells. We studied the effect of CBX7 on
embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and the potential role for
CBX7 in targeting key genes frequently silenced in association
with DNA hypermethylation in adult cancer. Our results allow us
to propose a potential mechanism, whereby through assembly of
repressive complexes, the polycomb component of PRC1 can
participate in and promote epigenetic changes involving abnormal DNA hypermethylation of genes frequently silenced in adult
cancers.

CBX7 Initiates Heritable Cancer Gene Silencing

Figure 1. CBX7 interacts with DNMTs.
A, CBX7 is detected by anti-CBX7
antibody in breast, prostate, and colorectal
cancer cell lines as indicated. HA-CBX7
cell lysate is used as a positive control.
B, coimmunoprecipitation and Western
blot analyses were performed in 293T cells
expressing HA-CBX7 and FLAG
constructs as indicated.
C, coimmunoprecipitation and Western
blot analyses were performed in NCCIT
cells transfected with HA-CBX7 as
indicated. Antibodies to CBP and IgG
served as controls. D, endogenous
coimmunoprecipitation was performed in
RKO cells with antibodies as indicated. HA
was used as a negative control. Western
analysis was performed using antibodies
against endogenous CBX7 or G9a.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids. CBX7 (NM_175709.2) containing a COOH terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag was cloned into pEF1a-IRES-puro.
Cell culture. Cell lines were maintained according to American Type
Culture Collection guidelines. Stable selection used 0.2 Ag/mL puromycin
(Sigma) selection. Population doublings were calculated as described (14).
All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Western analysis. Antibodies used were CBX7 (Invitrogen, custom), HA
(Santa Cruz), DNMT1 (Santa Cruz), and Flag (Sigma). Lamin-B (Santa Cruz)
and h-actin (Sigma) are used as loading controls where indicated.
Expression analysis. Real-time PCR was performed using conditions
and primers described previously, including initial normalization to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (3). Microarray data were
generated using Agilent whole human genome, 4  44K microarrays, as
previously described (19).
Coimmunoprecipitation. Whole-cell lysates were prepared using a
modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Nuclear proteins
(Pierce) were prepared using a standard RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitation was
performed with rotation overnight at 4jC. Protein A/G agarose beads
(eBioscience) were added for 2 h. Four washes were performed with TNE
buffer. Complexes were eluted by boiling in 2 LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen).
Small interfering RNA. Tera-2 cells were transfected with a nontargeting control or DNMT1 targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA;
sequences available upon request) as previously described (11).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) was performed as previously described (11) using previously

www.aacrjournals.org

designed primers (3). Antibodies used were DNMT1 (Imgenex), DNMT3a
(Imgenex), DNMT3b (Imgenex), HA (Santa Cruz or Covance), and IgG
(Upstate).
Bisulfite sequencing. Genomic DNA extraction, bisulfite modification
and sequencing from vector control, CBX7-expressing, or ATRA-treated
CBX7-expressing Tera-2 cells at passage 30 were performed as previously
described (11, 20). Primers used were within promoters for CDH1, GATA4,
sFRP4, sFRP5, and sFRP1 (available upon request).
Infinium analysis. DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina
Infinium platform (21). Each probe is assigned a b value, indicating full
methylation of a specific CpG site (b = 1), absence of methylation (b = 0),
and every situation in between (0 V b V 1) using the signal of the
methylated probe over the signal sum of the methylated plus unmethylated
probe. Probes with insignificant or uncertain calls (P > 0.05) were removed
from the subsequent analysis. In vitro methylated DNA (IVD) and DNA from
cells genetically deleted for DNMT1 and DNMT3b (DKO; ref. 22), were used
as fully methylated and fully unmethylated controls, respectively. Probes
that showed clear methylation (b > 0.75) or clear demethylation (b < 0.25)
in IVD and DKO were used.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 3.7%
formaldehyde and processed for staining as described previously (23).

Results
CBX7 interacts with DNA methylation machinery. We first
explored the links between CBX7 and stable silencing of key target
genes in cancer by assessing expression of CBX7 in cancer cell

lines. Colorectal cancer lines have the highest levels of CBX7
(Fig. 1A) and RKO cells, in particular, have high levels of CBX7
relative to other colorectal cancer lines surveyed (Fig. 1A). RKO has
been previously characterized as having an unusually high number
of genes silenced in association with DNA hypermethylation (19).
Previous studies have suggested that PRC1 complexes may be
important in translating repressive chromatin modifications to
gene repression (8, 13). CBX7 is known to interact with repressive
chromatin modifications (17) and has been shown to repress
expression of a known TSG (14), targeted for methylation in a
variety of cancers (15). DNA methylation is mediated by DNMTs in
normal (24–26) and cancer cells (22, 27, 28), leading us to search for
interactions between CBX7 and these enzymes. We coexpressed
FLAG-tagged DNMT1 and DNMT3b with HA-tagged CBX7 in the
293T human embryonic kidney cell line and searched for
interactions via coimmunoprecipitation analyses. We found
coimmunoprecipitation between DNMT1, DNMT3b, and CBX7
(Fig. 1B) but not JMJD1A, a histone demethylase enzyme that
would eradicate the silencing mark, dimethylated H3K9 (29), and
thus is an unlikely component of a repressive complex. We found
these not only with the above-tagged constructs but also with all
three endogenous DNMTs (Fig. 1C) in NCCIT cells that have high
levels of DNMTs (30). The transcriptional activator CBP, not
expected to reside in a repressive complex, did not coimmunoprecipitate with CBX7. Finally, using as a positive control, G9a, a
histone methyltransferase that establishes a key silencing
mark, dimethylated H3K9 (29), and interacts with all three DNMTs
(31, 32), we find that DNMTs are able to complex with CBX7 in
RKO colorectal carcinoma cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, CBX7/DNMT
complexes exist in multiple cell types, including cancer cells

containing high levels of cancer-specific DNA methylation,
suggesting this PRC1 constituent may play a role in the
establishment and/or maintenance of gene silencing.
CBX7 expression in cancer cells may not be the sole
mechanism for maintaining gene silencing. To determine if
CBX7 is necessary to maintain stable silencing of key target genes
in cancer, we used siRNA to knockdown CBX7 in RKO cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). We did not find reexpression of the
cancer-related genes surveyed (Supplementary Fig. S1B), suggesting that CBX7 does not solely maintain the deep silencing
associated with cancer-specific DNA hypermethylation. Similar
results were observed with knockdown of the PRC2 protein, EZH2
(11, 12). Thus, whereas CBX7 may still be important in targeting
genes for stable silencing involving DNA methylation, the resultant
methylation may not be easily reversible through loss of a single
PcG constituent.
CBX7 confers a growth advantage to EC cells. To explore the
possibility that the CBX7 interactions observed may play a role in
the establishment of silencing of genes frequently associated with
cancer-specific DNA hypermethylation, we used EC cells, Tera-2,
that have less hypermethylation of cancer-related genes than adult
cancer cells (3). CBX7 expression is low in cycling Tera-2 cells,
initially increases with ATRA treatment, which induces neural
differentiation in these cells (33, 34), and decreases back to low
expression as the induced cells fully differentiate and enter
senescence (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that reduction in CBX7
expression may be important for EC cell terminal differentiation.
Our previous study shows that Tera-2 cells do possess, for many
genes studied, repressive histone modifications even without the
dense promoter DNA methylation they exhibit in adult cancers (3).

CBX7 Initiates Heritable Cancer Gene Silencing

Figure 3. CBX7 targets genes frequently
silenced in adult cancer. A, real-time
PCR expression in CBX7 cells (solid
columns ) is shown relative to vector
control cell expression (open columns )
normalized to one. Columns, mean fold
change for triplicates; bars, SE. Passage

Each spot represents the natural logarithm
of the normalized single-channel value in
the empty vector (X axis) versus the
CBX7-overexpressing cells (Y axis). The
color code represents the relative
expression level in CBX7-overexpressing
cells versus control cells. C, Venn
diagram shows the distribution of CBX7
repressed genes with promoter region
CpG islands and genes regulated by PcG.
A saturated generalized linear model fit to
the nominal count data showed that
associations between genes repressed
by CBX7, CpG island–containing genes,
and genes that are marked by
PcG in progenitor cells are significant
(P = 0.018406) as were the interactions
between genes down-regulated by
CBX7 and genes known to be marked by
PcG constituents in progenitor cells
(P = 9.73e 05) and between genes
down-regulated by CBX7 containing CpG
islands (P = 0.002425).

These histone modifications are those that might prime promoters
for PRC1 docking, CBX7 interaction (17), and further movement
toward stable silencing. To test this hypothesis, we stably overexpressed HA-tagged CBX7 in Tera-2 cells. HA-tagged CBX7 was
appropriately nuclear and stably expressed over 20 passages
(Fig. 2B and C). Similar to studies performed using mouse
embryonic fibroblasts and human fibroblasts (14), CBX7 overexpression was able to confer a growth advantage to Tera-2 cells
when compared with vector control cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that
our CBX7 construct is functionally active in Tera-2 cells. However,
unlike in the studies carried out in fibroblasts (14), p16 protein
levels were unchanged in our system (data not shown), suggesting
additional gene targets may be important in mediating the
observed growth promotion.
CBX7 targets genes frequently silenced in association with
hypermethylation in adult cancer. To identify targets of CBX7mediated gene suppression that would be candidates for CBX7 in
initiating stable gene silencing, we carried out a real time–based
gene survey. Specifically, we queried CpG island–containing genes
marked by PcG in embryonic cells (35–37) and often silenced in
association with DNA hypermethylation in cancer (1, 2). We found
that CDH1, TIMP3, TSP-1, sFRP4, sFRP5, GATA4, and GATA5 were
repressed by CBX7 (data not shown). We selected CDH1, GATA4,
sFRP4, and sFRP5 for further study. All four genes are stably
repressed over multiple passages (Fig. 3A).
We further addressed, on a global level, whether CBX7 may
target an even larger pool of genes. Using an Agilent ‘‘Whole

www.aacrjournals.org

Human Genome’’ array (Fig. 3B), we found 518 genes are
suppressed to <50% of control expression. Importantly, over
70%, of these genes also contain CpG islands in their promoters.
Finally, 154 genes, equaling almost 50% of CBX7 repressed
genes that contain CpG islands, have also previously been
identified as PcG targets in stem or progenitor cells (refs.
35–38; Fig. 3C).
Dependence of CBX7-mediated repression on DNMTs. We
next used ChIP analysis to determine whether CBX7 was localized
to its repressed gene targets. We found CBX7 at the promoter of all
four target genes concomitant with enrichment of DNMT1,
DNMT3a, and DNMT3b (Fig. 4A). Whereas there were no
significant changes in repressive or activating histone modifications across all four genes (data not shown), our previously noted
presence of ‘‘bivalent chromatin’’ (39) and additional repressive
marks, dimethylated and trimethylated H3K9 (18, 40, 41), suggest
that these resident histone modifications provide an appropriate
setting for PRC1 docking via the CBX7 chromodomain (17) and
recruitment of DNMTs.
The formation of a DNMT containing complex at CBX7 target
gene promoters suggests that DNMTs may be required for CBX7mediated gene suppression. We found that DNMT1 knockdown by
siRNA resulted in a selective increase in GATA4 gene expression in
CBX7-overexpressing cells only (Fig. 4B and C). sFRP4 gene
expression increased somewhat in both vector control and CBX7
cells, suggesting that DNMT1 may play a role in establishing the
basal expression level for this gene in Tera-2 cells (Fig. 4C). CDH1

and sFRP5 expression were not affected by knockdown of DNMT1
(data not shown).
To further address the potential role for all three DNMTs in
CBX7-mediated gene silencing, we treated CBX7-overexpressing
and vector control cells with 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine, which inhibits
all three DNMTs. We observed the most dramatic increase in gene
expression of CDH1, GATA4, and sFRP4 selectively in CBX7
expressing cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that all of the DNMTs are
participating in the CBX7-mediated repression at target gene
promoters.
CBX7 overexpression attenuates response to differentiation
by ATRA. PcG targets in embryonic or progenitor cells include
many differentiation-related genes that are frequently DNA hypermethylated in colon cancers (3–5). Thus, we tested the effect of
sustained CBX7 expression on differentiation in response to ATRA
(33, 34). As expected, vector control cells treated with ATRA
differentiated and ultimately senesced by day 21 (Fig. 5A). In sharp
contrast, CBX7 cells adopted some morphologic changes by day 10,
but all cells did not senesce and a population actually began to
undergo colony formation (Fig. 5B). CBX7 expression was stable
throughout the ATRA treatment (Fig. 5B). CBX7 cells did respond
to ATRA treatment during the first 10 days by reducing expression
of stem cell genes, OCT4 and SOX2 (Fig. 5C). However, the
persistent colony-forming cells likely represent a selection of cells
retaining embryonic properties, because OCT4 and SOX2 remain at
full or above basal levels by day 30 (Fig. 5C). Additionally, whereas
vector control cells differentiate toward a neural lineage as
evidenced by induction of the early neural precursor gene NESTIN,
CBX7 cells showed no change in NESTIN expression (Fig. 5C).

Two CBX7 target genes, GATA4 and sFRP4, have previously been
shown to increase in expression upon ATRA-induced differentiation in the Tera-2 cells (3). GATA4 has also been previously
described as necessary for differentiation of gastric epithelium in
mice (42). In vector control cells, we saw a 20-fold increase in
expression of this gene by day 10 of ATRA treatment (Fig. 5D).
However, throughout the entire course of ATRA-induced differentiation and senescence, there was no change in GATA4 expression
in CBX7-expressing cells. sFRP4 expression increased dramatically
in the treated, vector control cells, but after a transient increase
through day 10 in CBX7 cells, this level was not sustained by 30
days in ATRA (Fig. 5D). Together, these data suggest that CBX7
cells may be initially responsive to ATRA but do not terminally
differentiate, can bypass senescence, and survive this process in a
progenitor-like state.
CBX7 promotes initiation of DNA hypermethylation. As
described, expression of sFRP4 and GATA4 either returned to or
was held in a suppressed state in ATRA-resistant CBX7 cells
(Fig. 5D). This may reflect a selection process in which the CBX7
cells that were unable to induce expression of differentiationresponsive genes were the population that escaped ATRA-induced
senescence. The studies with 5-azacytidine (Fig. 4C) suggest that
promoter DNA hypermethylation provides a potential mechanism
by which this may occur. Thus, we examined DNA methylation at
the promoters of our four target genes that were stably repressed
by CBX7.
Using bisulfite sequence analysis, we observed a modest increase
in methylation of the CDH1, GATA4, and sFRP4 promoters in CBX7
cells relative to parental cells and vector controls (Fig. 6A;

Supplementary Figs. S2 and S4). DNA methylation became most
prominent in all four genes in CBX7 cells that were exposed to
ATRA for 30 days (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S4). A control gene
(sFRP1) that was not a target of CBX7-mediated gene repression
also did not show any increase in promoter DNA methylation
(Supplementary Fig. S3). These data suggest that CBX7 can
contribute to increasing promoter DNA methylation of key genes
that may provide an additional layer of target gene suppression,
especially in cells with a block to differentiation-induced cell
senescence.
To further address a role for CBX7 in initiation of methylation,
we used an epigenomic approach for the analysis of DNA
hypermethylation using the Illumina Infinium bead platform. We
interrogated over 27,000 CpG loci that encompass over 14,000
genes (21, 43). Whereas the majority of genes in the Tera-2 cell lines
shown have relatively low levels of DNA methylation, we identified
a progressive increase in promoter DNA methylation of 441 genes
with CpG islands in CBX7 cells and CBX7 cells that were exposed
to ATRA for 30 days (Fig. 6B), independent of their expression
status (Supplementary Table S1). Seventy percent of these genes
have been previously identified as PcG targets in embryonic cells
(35–37), an even higher number than correlated with this
parameter in all previous studies (3–5). Also, many genes showing
the above increased methylation include genes known to be

www.aacrjournals.org

hypermethylated in human cancer including, but not limited to,
MLH1, HIC1, and SOX17 (reviewed in refs. 1, 2, 44), as well as the
four genes under study in this report (Fig. 6C).
We then focused our analysis to the subset of genes containing
promoter CpG islands that were both repressed by CBX7 and
showed increased methylation as measured by Infinium. We
identified 25 genes (Supplementary Table S2) that met these
criteria, whereas only five genes showed an increase in methylation
that had increased expression upon CBX7 overexpression (Fig. 6D).
Interestingly, most genes that showed an increase in methylation
had relatively low baseline methylation in vector control cells
(B V 0.4; Fig. 6D). These data suggest that CBX7-mediated
repression can promote methylation in a subset of target genes
and that this methylation may often reflect a true initiation
mechanism rather than expansion of an already-existing
methylation.

Discussion
It has been previously suggested that a stem cell–like chromatin
state at the promoter regions of genes frequently targeted for DNA
hypermethylation in cancer may predispose these genes for cancerspecific silencing (3–5). Whereas such hypotheses have included a
potential role for PcG proteins in this process, a clear link has

remained elusive. Our results now show a potential direct link
between PRC1, stable suppression of gene expression, and the
machinery involved in establishing cancer-specific silencing
in association with induction or expansion of promoter DNA
hypermethylation.
We have shown that the RKO colorectal cancer cell line,
previously characterized as having a substantial number of genes
silenced in association with DNA hypermethylation (19), also
contains the highest relative level of CBX7 expression. We have
shown that CBX7 can complex with DNMT1, DNMT3a, and
DNMT3b. However, despite the presence of a complex containing
CBX7 and DNMTs in RKO cells, we are unable to relieve gene
suppression upon knockdown of CBX7. There are several potential
explanations, including one that has been observed for another
PcG constituent. Our previous study, as well as those of others, have
shown that whereas the trimethylated H3K27 mark, placed by
the methyltransferase, EZH2, may be important in stem cells
for targeting genes susceptible to cancer-specific DNA methylation
(3–5), knockdown of this protein in adult cancers is not sufficient
to rescue gene silencing once such genes are DNA hypermethylated
(11, 12). These previous findings, as well as our current data

surrounding knockdown of CBX7, may emphasize the dominant
role for dense CpG island DNA methylation over associated
repressive chromatin states in maintaining heritable silencing.
We have also shown that overexpression of the PRC1 protein CBX7
can lead to increased population doubling of EC cells, as well as
important epigenetic changes. The growth promotion observed is
associated with the suppression of genes frequently methylated in
cancer, including, CDH1, GATA4, sFRP4, and sFRP5. Additional gene
expression profiling at the level of the whole genome suggests that a
significant number of CBX7 target genes are both PcG marked and
contain promoter CpG islands. As stated, it has been previously postulated that promoters of genes susceptible to cancer-specific DNA
hypermethylation are enriched for PcG-marked chromatin (3–5).
We now suggest that such genes are also potential CBX7 targets.
We have further shown that CBX7 localization to target gene
promoters results in the assembly of a novel complex containing
DNMTs. CBX7-mediated gene suppression requires DNMTs, as
shown in our study, involving 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine. These data
provide the first clear link between PRC1 and DNA methylation
machinery, both by physical association and recruitment to target
genes repressed by CBX7.

CBX7 Initiates Heritable Cancer Gene Silencing

It is plausible that the initial gene suppression observed upon
CBX7 overexpression may involve a noncatalytic function for
DNMTs acting instead as transcriptional repressors. CBX7-mediated gene suppression is evident despite little increase in DNA
methylation in CBX7 cells in the absence of ATRA treatment. In
this regard, previous studies have shown that all three DNMTs are
capable of repressing transcription (45–48) in a manner potentially
separate from their ability to methylate CpGs (28, 45–48). However,
the sustained presence of this DNMT-containing complex at CBX7
target gene promoters may eventually allow for a modest induction
or progression of promoter DNA methylation, particularly in
genes that have a low-to-no-baseline methylation. This is more
pronounced in ATRA-treated cells. Work of others has shown that
an antisense RNA causes DNA methylation of a TSG upon cell
differentiation (49). Similarly, in our EC system, increased
methylation and stable target gene suppression may confer partial
resistance to differentiation in that CBX7 targets may be less
susceptible to ATRA-induced gene expression. Such stable gene
silencing may then promote a selective survival advantage,
potentially giving increase to a population of EC cells that
resembles adult cancer cells with more extensive aberrant CpG
island promoter DNA methylation. This type of evolution of
promoter DNA hypermethylation may reflect a process by which a
progenitor cell is rendered abnormal during transformation to an
adult cancer cell.
In summary, we have provided a potential mechanism by which
PRC1 may contribute to the maintenance of the stem-like state of

pluripotent cells via stable repression of key target genes, which
would otherwise be maintained in a poised state available for
signal transduction–induced increases in gene expression. We now
show that sustained expression and localization of the PRC1
protein CBX7, in concert with key partner proteins, to target gene
promoters in an embryonic tumor cell can blunt the response to
differentiation cues, giving increase to a population of cells that
model key epigenetic aspects of adult cancer. Together, our studies
highlight a key potential role for the polycomb component of
the PcG silencing system in tumorigenesis through promotion
of epigenetic changes in a progenitor-like cell (Supplementary
