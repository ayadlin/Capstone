the Type I Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor: Implications
for Breast Cancer Treatment

Abstract
The role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in breast cancer is well deﬁned, and inhibitors of this
pathway are currently in clinical trials. The majority of anti-IGF1R clinical trials are in estrogen receptor–positive
patients who have progressed on prior endocrine therapy; early reports show no beneﬁt for addition of IGF1R
inhibitors to endocrine therapy in this setting. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of IGF1R inhibitors in
vitro by generating tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) cells. We found that TamR cells had diminished levels of IGF1R
with unchanged levels of insulin receptor (IR), and failed to respond to IGF-I–induced Akt activation,
proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth while retaining responsiveness to both insulin and IGF-II.
The IGF1R antibody dalotuzumab inhibited IGF-I–mediated Akt phosphorylation, proliferation, and anchorageindependent growth in parental cells, but had no effect on TamR cells. An IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
AEW541, with equal potency for the IGF1R and IR, inhibited IGF-I-, IGF-II-, and insulin-stimulated Akt
phosphorylation, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth in parental cells. Interestingly, AEW541 also
inhibited insulin- and IGF-II–stimulated effects in TamR cells. Tamoxifen-treated xenografts also had reduced
levels of IGF1R, and dalotuzumab did not enhance the effect of tamoxifen. We conclude that cells selected for
tamoxifen resistance in vitro have downregulated IGF1R making antibodies directed against this receptor
ineffective. Inhibition of IR may be necessary to manage tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. Cancer Res; 72(13);

Introduction
The ﬁrst and arguably most effective targeted therapy for
breast cancer involves inhibition of estrogen receptor (ER)
function. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has proven effective in both early and advanced stages of
breast cancer (1). In addition, depriving receptors of ligand
using aromatase inhibitors and degrading receptors through
pure nonsteroidal anti-estrogens have also proven effective.
Unfortunately, after initial success, a large portion of these
tumors will develop resistance. This has led to the exploration and identiﬁcation of additional targeted therapies,
namely against growth factor receptors, such as EGFR,
HER2, and IGF1R.
The IGF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase that exerts its
biologic effects through binding of the ligands IGF-I and
IGF-II. Following, ligand binding and receptor activation,
adaptor molecules are recruited, leading to activation of
downstream pathways, including the mitogen-activated pro-

tein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K pathways, ultimately leading to
proliferation, angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, and metastasis (2, 3). The closely related insulin receptor behaves in a
similar manner, through its ligands insulin and IGF-II.
Cross-talk between the IGF1R and estrogen receptor has
been well-documented and has led to clinical trials investigating the combined use of IGF1R and ER-inhibitors. Multiple
studies have shown that ERa can enhance IGF1R signaling
through transcriptional upregulation of IGF1R, IRS-1, and
IGF-II (4–8). Reciprocally, IGF1R has been shown phosphorylate and activate ER on serine-167 through an S6-kinase
mechanism (9). In addition to current IGF1R inhibitor clinical
trials examining combined anti-IGF1R, anti-ER therapies, trials
are also being conducted in endocrine-resistant populations.
The role of the IGF1R in cancer has been established and
clinical trials evaluating inhibitors to this pathway are currently underway (10). As noted, preclinical studies have documented cross-talk between IGF1R and ER pathways (11), yet
clinical trials conducted primarily in endocrine-resistant
patients have been disappointing (12). In vitro and in vivo
evaluation has been conducted using endocrine sensitive cells,
with relatively little evidence showing the effectiveness of antiIGF1R therapy in endocrine-resistant cells.
Two strategies of targeting the IGF1R are currently being
evaluated in clinical trials. Monoclonal antibodies bind to the
IGF1R, leading to receptor internalization and downregulation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors bind to the ATP catalytic

domain of the internal tyrosine kinase domain of the IGF1R
and the closely related insulin receptor. Although some view
targeting of the IR dangerous because of metabolic consequences, recent data suggest a beneﬁt to targeting the IR (13,
14). Multiple reports have showed a role for the insulin receptor
in cancer biology (15–17). Furthermore, phase I clinical trials
have shown limited metabolic consequences that can be
treated using metformin (18). Thus, the clinical beneﬁt of
using IGF1R/IR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKI) may outweigh
their potential metabolic side effects.
The overall aim of our study was to investigate the
effectiveness of anti-IGF therapies using an endocrine resistant model. Herein, we reveal tamoxifen-resistant cells lack
expression of IGF1R, and hence, are unaffected by IGF1R
monoclonal antibodies. Tamoxifen-treated xenografts also
have reduced levels of IGF1R and mice do not beneﬁt from
combined treatment with tamoxifen and dalotuzumab. Furthermore, complete and successful suppression of IGF1R
signaling may require dual-inhibition of IGF1R and PI3K
targets, as is currently under study in the clinic. Alternatively, endocrine-resistant patients may require the use of
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which are effective through inhibition of IR signaling.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
unless otherwise indicated. IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin were
purchased from Novozymes GroPep Limited and Eli Lilly,
respectively.
Cell lines and culture
All cells were grown at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 and supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin. MCF-7 cells were provided by
C. Kent Osborne (Baylor College of Medicine) and maintained
in improved MEM Richter's modiﬁcation medium (zinc
option) supplemented with 5% FBS and 11.25 nmol/L insulin.
MCF-7 TamR cells were generated by culturing MCF-7 in
phenol-red free IMEM (zinc option) supplemented with
11.25 nmol/L insulin, 5% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS, and
100 nmol/L 4-OH tamoxifen. T47D cells were obtained from
ATCC and maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS and
6 ng/mL insulin. T47D TamR cells were generated by culturing
T47D cells in phenol-red free IMEM supplemented with 5%
charcoal/dextran-treated FBS, and 100 nmol/L 4-OH tamoxifen. TamR cells were grown in the presence of 4-OH tamoxifen
for 6 months to allow resistance to develop before characterizing cells. As a control, parental cells were cultured for the
same amount of time in regular media. Following the establishment of resistance, cells were passed for no more than 3
months.
Antibodies
Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine
(PY-20) was purchased from BD Biosciences. The ERa antibody used for Western blot analysis was purchased from

www.aacrjournals.org

Neomarkers Lab Vision. The IRb antibody was purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies for phosphorylated Akt,
IGF1Rb, and total and phospho-p44/42 (MAPK/ERK) were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-rabbit and
anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies were purchased from Pierce.
Growth curve analysis
Cells were plated at a density of 1  104 in 6-well plates and
allowed to equilibrate overnight. Full medium was replaced
with phenol-red free IMEM supplemented with 1% dextrancoated-charcoal (DCC)-FBS. 4-OH tamoxifen was added to
cells at concentration and time as indicated in the ﬁgures.
Cells were stained with trypan blue and counted using a
hemacytometer.
Immunoblot
Cells were plated at a density of 3  105 in 60-mm-diameter
dishes and allowed to equilibrate overnight. Full medium was
replaced with DCC-treated fetal calf serum for the next 3 to 5
days, after which cells were switched to serum-free medium
(SFM) for 24 hours. Upon reaching 70% conﬂuency, cells were
treated, placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and
lysed with lysis buffer of 50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1%
Nonidet P-40, 2 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mmol/L NaCl,
10 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 20 mg/mL leupeptin, and 20 mg/mL aprotinin). Lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for
15 minutes at 4 C. Protein concentrations were determined
using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).
Cellular protein (50 mg) was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted
according to manufacturer guidelines.
Monolayer growth assay
Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells
per well, allowed to equilibrate overnight and starved in SFM
media for 24 hours. After 5 days of treatment, growth was
assessed via the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (19). Sixty
microliters of 5 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution in SFM was added to each
well. After incubation for 3 hours at 37 C, wells were aspirated
and formazan crystals were lysed with 500 mL of solubilization
solution (95% DMSO þ 5% IMEM). Absorbance was measured
with a plate reader at 570 nm using a 650 nm differential ﬁlter
to assess growth.
Anchorage-independent growth
A 1-mL layer of 0.8% SeaPlaque-agarose (BioWhittaker) in
1% FBS-containing growth media was solidiﬁed into each
well of a 6-well plate. The bottom layer was overlaid with 0.8
mL of a 0.45% top agar mixture for 10,000 cells per well with
appropriate treatment. All plates were incubated at 37 C.
After 12 days colony number was assessed on a light
microscope with an ocular grid. Five random ﬁelds were
counted per well and only colonies exceeding two thirds of a
grid square were scored.

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Cells were plated at a density of 1  106 in 100-mm-diameter
dishes, allowed to equilibrate overnight, DCC starved for 3
days, and incubated overnight in SFM. Cells were treated with
SFM or 1 nmol/L estradiol for 4 hours. Cellular RNA was
isolated using TriPure Reagent according to the manufacturer
(Roche). For quality control and to determine concentration, a
260:280 assay was conducted on a spectrophotometer. Forward and reverse primers were designed to target the following
transcripts: PGR, KIAA0575, INSR, RPLP0 and IGF1R. A total of
2 mg of RNA was reverse transcribed using the Transcriptor
Reverse Transcriptase Kit, and quantitative PCR was conducted using the Universal SYBR Green Kit according to the
manufacturer's recommended protocol (Roche) on an Eppendorf Mastercycler Realplex4 machine. The relative concentration of mRNA was calculated using cycle threshold values that
were derived from a standard curve and normalized to ribosomal protein, large, P0 as an internal control.
Xenograft growth
All animal protocols were approved by the University of
Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
MCF-7L cells (5  106) were injected into the mammary fat
pad of 5-week-old female ovariectomized athymic mice. One
day before injection, mice were administered estrogen via
drinking water at a concentration of 1 mmol/L as described
previously (20). Tumors were allowed to achieve an average
volume of 200 mm3 before beginning treatment. Tamoxifen
citrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was subcutaneously administered at a
dose of 500 mg in a peanut oil emulsion daily for 5 of 7 days per
week. Dalotuzumab was administered twice weekly via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 500 mg. Control animals were
injected with histidine-based buffer and peanut oil alone.
Tumor growth was measured bidirectionally and tumor
volumes were calculated using the formula length 
breadth2/2.

Results
Tamoxifen-resistant cells are refractory to tamoxifen
treatment but respond to estrogen treatment
To examine the effect of anti-IGF therapy in endocrine
resistance, tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7L and T47D cells were
generated. After selection, TamR cells survived in the presence
of increasing concentrations of tamoxifen; however, parental
cells were inhibited with as little as 1 nmol/L tamoxifen
(Fig. 1A). Thus, TamR cells continued to survive and grow in
the presence of tamoxifen, even up to concentrations of 1
mmol/L, showing resistance to the drug. Similar to some
tamoxifen-resistant cancers, TamR cells maintained expression of estrogen receptor (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, TamR cells
were able to proliferate in response to estrogen (Fig. 1C). When
we examined gene expression regulated by ER in TamR cells,
we found basal levels of estrogen regulated genes such as
KIAA0575 (GREB1), PGR (Fig. 1D), TFF1, AREG, CTSD, and
IGF1R (data not shown) were downregulated; however, estrogen was still able to stimulate transcription of these genes.
Similar to the clinical situation of tamoxifen resistance where

3374

Cancer Res; 72(13) July 1, 2012

some tumors remain dependent on estradiol, our cells maintained estrogen receptor expression and responded to estrogen treatment.
Tamoxifen-resistant cells expressed low levels of IGF1R
Before examining the effectiveness of anti-IGF therapy in
TamR cells, we examined the IGF signaling pathway and its
components. Interestingly, IGF1R protein levels were diminished as measured by Western blot (Fig. 2A). Furthermore,
TamR cells failed to phosphorylated Akt and MAPK after IGF-I
treatment. The cells retained expression of IR and insulin and
IGF-II ligand treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Akt and
MAPK. To examine whether this change in IGF1R expression
was because of decreased transcription, we conducted quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine the message level
of IGF1R. Indeed, IGF1R mRNA was decreased in TamR cells
compared with parental cells (Fig. 2B). Treating TamR cells
with estrogen resulted in a small increase in IGF1R mRNA, but
did not restore the receptor to parental levels (Fig. 2B). Insulin
receptor mRNA levels were not signiﬁcantly different between
parental and resistant cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, estrogen
treatment did not affect IR levels in either cell line. These data
show that tamoxifen-resistant cells lack IGF1R expression, but
maintain expression of IR and are able to signal through IR.
Dalotuzumab inhibited signaling, proliferation, and
anchorage-independent growth in parental, but not
TamR cells
Dalotuzumab (MK-0646) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the IGF1R. It has been shown to downregulate
IGF1R in vitro and in vivo (21, 22). To examine the ability of the
antibody to inhibit IGF-induced signaling, we pretreated MCF7L parental and TamR cells with 20 mg/mL dalotuzumab for 24
hours before stimulating cells with ligand. Dalotuzumab inhibited IGF-I signaling, as measured via Akt and MAPK phosphorylation, in MCF-7L (Fig. 3A) and T47D (data not shown)
parental cells and had a minimal effect on both insulin and
IGF-II signaling. TamR cells did not respond to IGF-I, but Akt
was activated by IGF-II and insulin. Dalotuzumab did not affect
response to any of the ligands in TamR cells, presumably
because of lack of IGF1R expression. To examine if this
difference was also biologically relevant, we examined the
effect of dalotuzumab on proliferation and anchorage-independent growth using the MTT and soft agar assays, respectively. All IGF system ligands tested induced proliferation in
MCF-7L and T47D (data not shown) parental cells; however,
only proliferation in response to IGF-I was inhibited in the
presence of dalotuzumab (Fig. 3B). In contrast, insulin and to a
lesser extent IGF-II stimulated the proliferation of TamR cells
and this proliferation was not inhibited by dalotuzumab.
Similarly, all ligands induced the anchorage-independent
growth of MCF-7L parental cells (Fig. 3C) and dalotuzumab
inhibited growth in response to IGF-I and IGF-II. In agreement
with the signaling data, both insulin and IGF-II induced the
anchorage-independent growth of TamR cells. This growth
was not inhibited by dalotuzumab. Thus, dalotuzumab inhibited IGF-I induced signaling, proliferation, and anchorageindependent growth in MCF-7L parental cells, but had no

was able to inhibit insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II–stimulated

IGF-II–stimulated anchorage-independent growth in TamR

proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth by suppressing both IGF1R and IR function in MCF-7L parental
cells. Interestingly, AEW541 was also able to inhibit the
growth of TamR cells presumably via suppression of IR
signaling. These data show that TKI's, which target both
IGF1R and IR, are effective in parental and resistant cells,
because of inhibition of IR signaling.

We next examined the effect of dalotuzumab on the in vivo
growth of MCF-7L cells. Ovariectomized athymic mice were
injected in the second mammary fat pad with MCF-7L cells as
previously described (23). Mice were administered estrogen to
stimulate tumor growth and tumors were allowed to establish
(tumor volume of 200 mm3) before beginning treatment.
Dalotuzumab (administered beginning at day 32) inhibited the
growth of estrogen-stimulated tumors (Fig. 5A). To study the
combination of tamoxifen and dalotuzumab, estradiol was
withdrawn on day 32 and tamoxifen was started. Dalotuzumab
treatment began simultaneously with tamoxifen (Tam þ
Dalotuzumab) or when tumors began to grown on tamoxifen
alone (Tam ! Dalotuzumab) at approximately day 74.

Figure 5. Tamoxifen-treated MCF-7L xenografts have reduced IGF1R
levels and do not respond to dalotuzumab treatment. A, ovariectomized
athymic mice were given estrogen to stimulate MCF-7L xenograft tumor
growth. At day 32, estrogen was withdrawn (unless indicated) and
treatments began. For the Tam ! dalotuzumab group, tamoxifen was
started at day 32, and dalotuzumab was started when tumors began to
grow despite tamoxifen treatment at approximately day 74. Tumor
volumes were measured weekly and average volume was plotted. B,
xenografts were harvested from mice, and total RNA was isolated using
TriPure Reagent. RNA was reverse-transcribed and analyzed using qRTPCR. Results were normalized to the RPLP0 housekeeping gene. An
unpaired t test was used to compare the difference between treatment
groups;  , P < 0.005.

1,000 mm3, mice were sacriﬁced and tumors were harvested for
RNA isolation. Expression of IGF1R mRNA was signiﬁcantly
reduced in tamoxifen-treated xenografts when compared with
estrogen-treated xenografts regardless of dalotuzumab treatment (Fig. 5B). Thus, tamoxifen-treated xenografts do not
beneﬁt from dalotuzumab treatment, because of decreased
IGF1R expression. However, estrogen-treated xenografts
express signiﬁcantly more IGF1R and beneﬁt from dalotuzumab treatment. These data suggest that the level of receptor
expression is important in determining response to dalotuzumab treatment and that estrogen receptor plays an important
role in regulating IGF1R expression.

Discussion
The recently published results of IGF1R antibodies in
clinical trials showing limited success in endocrine-resistant
populations prompted us to investigate their efﬁcacy using

3378

Cancer Res; 72(13) July 1, 2012

an endocrine-resistant model. Previous investigations into
the efﬁcacy of anti-IGF therapies have been conducted using
endocrine-sensitive cell lines and xenograft models. Because
IGF1R is an ER transcriptional target, understanding if
IGF1R expression was affected by resistance to tamoxifen
has clinical relevance. We found our tamoxifen-resistant cell
lines lacked both protein and mRNA expression of IGF1R,
but maintained expression of IR. This is in contrast to a
report by Westley and colleagues showing that tamoxifen
resistance in MCF-7 cells was associated with a dependence
on IGF-I (24). This contrary ﬁnding may be a result of a
difference in the way the tamoxifen-resistant cells were
generated; these investigators used low serum conditions
during generation of tamoxifen resistance while we used
compete media. When cells were selected in this manner,
tamoxifen became an ER agonist. Although seemingly contradictory, these ﬁndings are consistent with our own. IGF1R
expression requires agonism of ER. In Westley and colleagues, their "tamoxifen resistant" cells tamoxifen-stimulated
ER function. In our tamoxifen-resistant cells, we saw no
evidence of agonistic activity stimulated by tamoxifen (Fig.
1D).
On the basis of prior reports of ER transcriptional regulation of IGF1R, it is not surprising that IGF1R expression
would be decreased after acute treatment with a selective
estrogen receptor modulator such as tamoxifen (25–27).
Interestingly, studies conducted by Massarweh and colleagues using tamoxifen-resistant xenografts show decreased
total levels of IGF1R, but basal phosphorylation of the
receptor (28). This discordance may be explained by a
difference in dosage of tamoxifen in model systems. In our
model, tamoxifen is continuously administered to cells,
whereas, in the Massarweh study, animals are given tamoxifen 5 times weekly, leading to the possibility that ER
function is not completely suppressed in this model. Furthermore, this study did not clearly distinguish between
IGF1R or IR phosphorylation because the "phospho-speciﬁc"
antibody detects both receptors.
The ﬁnding that tamoxifen-resistant cells were refractory to
IGF1R antibody treatment underscores the importance of
using model systems similar to the patient populations the
drug will be used in. Although several studies have showed the
efﬁcacy of IGF1R monoclonal antibodies in breast cancer cells,
these cells have been endocrine sensitive (21, 23). The effect of
combined anti-estrogen/anti-IGF1R treatment should also
take into consideration whether the dose of anti-estrogen is
sufﬁcient, in and of itself, to suppress IGF1R function via
receptor downregulation. Our in vivo results show that tamoxifen treatment results in decreased IGF1R mRNA levels. Initial
results examining the effectiveness of IGF1R antibodies in
endocrine-resistant breast cancer populations have not
showed a deﬁnitive positive result (29, 30). This may be because
of the lack of IGF1R expression in these patient populations. A
recent study examining mRNA expression in a cohort of
tamoxifen-resistant patients with breast cancer has showed
a decrease in IGF1R levels in the recurrent tumors, suggesting
our ﬁndings in vitro may correlate with the clinical scenario
(31).

Tamoxifen-Resistant Cells Lose Expression of IGF1R

The efﬁcacy of TKI's in our tamoxifen-resistant cells underscores the importance of cotargeting the IR, along with the
IGF1R. Initially, development of IGF1R inhibitors aimed to
avoid targeting the IR, because of potential metabolic consequences. However, numerous studies by us and others have
showed that the IR does indeed play a role in cancer biology
(14, 18, 29, 32). Speciﬁcally, work by Hanahan and colleagues
showed that IGF1R inhibition using antibodies is only successful in tumors/cells where the IGF1R/IR ratio is high. In
addition, they show the IR can actually serve as an escape
mechanism, providing resistance to IGF1R antibodies (17).
Furthermore, work by Haluska and colleagues has shown that
when ﬁgitumumab (an IGF1R monoclonal antibody) is administered to patients, there is an associated increase in plasma
insulin (33). This increase in insulin levels could potentially
lead to increased IR signaling in tumor cells, providing yet
another escape mechanism for the cancer cells to survive.
These data are supported by a case report showing increased
copy number of IR in a woman with metastatic hormonerefractory breast cancer (34). The role of the IR in cancer
biology has been clearly deﬁned, and the metabolic consequences of its inhibition are actively being investigated. A
recent study conducted in mice showed that an IGF1R/IR TKI
alone or in combination with tamoxifen did not lead to a
signiﬁcant change in glucose homeostasis, suggesting the
drugs are tolerable. This study also showed the efﬁcacy of the
TKI in letrozole resistant xenografts, supporting our data that
suggest TKI's are more effective than antibodies in tamoxifenresistant cells (35).
Although our data indicate IGF1R antibodies may not be
effective in an endocrine-resistant system, this does not mean
they have little use. Multiple trials are underway, examining the
use of IGF1R antibodies in endocrine-sensitive populations.
One promising area of investigation is inhibiting both the
upstream (IGF1R) and downstream (mTOR) components of
the IGF1R pathway, leading to maximal inhibition of signaling.
Inhibition of IGF1R has been shown to sensitize cells to mTOR

inhibition (36). In addition, clinical trials are underway examining the efﬁcacy of combining IGF1R antibodies with mTOR
inhibitors (37, 38).
Overall, our data highlight the importance of using model
systems that will match the patient population the drug will
ultimately be used in. In addition, when evaluating IGF1R
therapies, it will be important to carefully select the proper
patient population, as well as to verify the target is present.
Finally, our data suggest dual IGF1R/IR TKI's may be more
effective than IGF1R antibodies, because of inhibition of IR.
Combination therapy using IGF1R antibodies may require use
of an mTOR inhibitor for complete suppression of the target, as
is currently being evaluated in the clinic.
