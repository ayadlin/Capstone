BACKGROUND: Although it has been demonstrated that the neuronal intermediate filament alpha-internexin (INA) is
closely related to 1p19q codeletion in gliomas, its prognostic and predictive value has not yet been confirmed in a
prospective trial. The authors of this report assessed the prognostic significance of INA expression and its correlation
with relevant clinical and molecular characteristics in the prospective, randomized European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26951 trial of adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) in
patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors (AOTs). METHODS: INA immunohistochemistry expression in tumors
from 92 patients who were included in the EORTC 26951 trial was analyzed independently by 2 observers and was
correlated with relevant clinical characteristics, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS),
and with molecular features, including 1p/19q codeletion, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 gene (IDH1/IDH2) mutation, and O-6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. RESULTS: INA expression
was observed in 33 tumors and was strongly correlated with 1p/19q codeletion, IDH1 mutations, and MGMT promoter
methylation. It was associated with significantly better PFS and OS independent of the treatment received. By using
Cox proportional hazard modeling for OS with stepwise selection, INA expression, patient age, and performance status were identified as independent prognostic factors. The results indicated that INA expression may have an impact
on the efficacy of combined radiotherapy plus PCV. CONCLUSIONS: In a homogeneously treated group of patients
with grade III AOTs, INA expression had strong favorable prognostic significance for OS and may have predictive

of chemotherapy for these tumors remains controversial.
Furthermore, it became clear that whatever the treatment
(radiotherapy [RT] þ adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and
vincristine [PCV], neoadjuvant PCV þ RT, or RT alone),
patients who had codeleted 1p19q OIII and OAIII tumors
had a much better outcome than their nondeleted counterparts
(OS: >8 years vs 2-3 years).1,2 It is noteworthy that neither
trial established that the 1p19q codeletion was predictive of a
greater benefit from chemotherapy in terms of improved PFS.
A gene profiling study has demonstrated that 1p19q
codeleted gliomas (mostly oligodendrogliomas) preferentially express neural genes.3 This ‘‘proneural’’ signature—independent of the genomic profile—is correlated with a
better outcome.4 In contrast, gliomas with epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification (mostly glioblastomas) have a ‘‘mesenchymal’’ or ‘‘proliferative’’ profile
and a poor outcome. It is interesting to note that EGFR
amplification and 1p19q codeletion are mutually exclusive.5
One of the most differentially expressed genes between
1p19q-codeleted and EGFR-amplified gliomas was alphainternexin (INA), a proneural gene that encodes a neurofilament-interacting protein. The results from a recent retrospective study suggested that INA expression is predictive of
good outcomes in patients with OIII and OAIII.6

3016

The objective of the current study was to further
confirm the prognostic and predictive value of INA
expression in patients with AOTs in a completely independent dataset. INA immunohistochemistry was performed on available slides from patients who were
enrolled in the EORTC 26951 trial and was correlated
with PFS and OS (survival analyses were stratified by
randomized treatment), 1p19q status (as determined by
fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]), and other relevant prognostic factors, such as O-6 methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 gene (IDH1/IDH2)
mutation status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients were eligible for the EORTC 26951 trial if they
had been diagnosed by the local pathologist with OIII or
OAIII with at least 25% oligodendroglial elements
according to the 1994 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors7 and if
they had at least 3 of 5 following microscopic features in
their tumor tissue: high cellularity, mitoses, nuclear

Assessment of INA Expression
INA immunohistochemistry was carried out on 4-lm
paraffin sections of formalin-fixed tumor samples using
an antibody that targeted INA (internexin neuronal intermediate filament protein alpha; clone 2E3MOI; Novus
Biologicals, Interchim, Montlucon, France; 1:100 dilution), as described previously,6 on a Benchmark XT automated tissue staining system (Ventana Medical Systems,

Inc., Illkirch, France). Positive INA results were observed
either as fibrillar, crescent-shaped or more paranuclear,
dot-like intracytoplasmic inclusions. Isolated, entrapped,
INA-positive neurons or axons were not considered. The
percentages of INA-positive tumor cells were evaluated
semiquantitatively as follow: <10%, from 10% to 25%,
from 25% to 50%, or >50%. The labeling pattern was
described as follow: diffuse, INA-positive clusters, isolated
INA-positive cells (considered positive if >10% of cells
were labeled), or negative (<10% positive cells). Positively stained neural cells were used as an internal positive
control, especially for the negative slides. Slides were read
independently by 2 neuropathologists (K.M. and J.M.K.)
according to the above criteria. Discrepant cases were
reviewed by both observers to reach a consensus.

Genetic Analysis
All molecular studies were performed using areas that were
selected for a high tumor cell percentage. DNA was
extracted from frozen or formalin-fixed tissues. FISH was
used to assess copy number aberrations of chromosomes 1p,
19q, 7, 10, and 10q and the EGFR gene as described elsewhere.8 MGMT promoter methylation was assessed with
multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA)

codon 172 were sequenced as described previously.10,11
INA positivity was correlated with clinical characteristics (age, PS, involved lobe [frontal vs other]), with molecular features (polysomy chromosome 7 [CHR7poly],
EGFR amplification [EGFRamp], loss of chromosome 1p/
19q, loss of chromosome 10 [CHR10loss], MGMT promoter methylation, and IDH1 and IDH2 mutation), with
histologic features (pure oligodendroglioma vs mixed,
presence or absence of necrosis and endothelial proliferation), and with PFS and OS in both treatment groups.
PFS and OS were measured from the day of randomization. Patients provided written informed consent according to national and local regulations for this study.
Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS and
OS. Univariate analyses were performed first to assess the
prognostic significance of INA expression. For multivariate analyses, the following major prognostic clinical variables were used: type of surgery (resection or biopsy),

CHR10loss, MGMT promoter methylation, and IDH1/
IDH2 mutation. For the MGMT MLPA assay, the cutoff
value of 0.25 was used to distinguish between MGMT
promoter methylated and unmethylated tumors.12 Associations between factors—except for PS—were assessed
by using the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC), and
the Fisher exact test was used for inference. For PS and
age, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the Kruskall-Wallis
test was used. Survival analyses were performed with the
log-rank test and the Cox regression analysis stratified by
treatment with and without forward stepwise selection (at
5% significance). To save some power, only factors that
had strong significance (P < .01) in univariate analyses
were entered into the multivariate analyses. Internal validation of Cox models was performed by bootstrap resampling technique (at 5% significance) to assess whether the

RESULTS
Material to assess INA status was available from 92 of 368
patients in the study. Both PFS and OS were shorter for
the 92 patients who underwent INA status assessment
compared with the 276 patients without INA status
assessment (P ¼ .017 and P ¼ .014, respectively). Patients
who were analyzed for INA expression had a lower PS
(P ¼ .02); more frequently had tumors with more mitoses
(P ¼ .04); and more frequently had EGFRamp (P ¼ .05)
CHR7poly (P ¼ .02), and CHR10loss (P ¼ .04) (Table 1).
Correlative Analyses
Results from the evaluation of INA staining were concordant in the majority of patients (81 of 92 tumors).
Review and discussion of the 11 discordant evaluations
resulted in consensus for all tumors. Thirty-three results

3020

were considered positive. In 3 tumors, virtually all tumor
cells were immunopositive for INA (Fig. 1); and, in 30
tumors, focal positivity was noticed. The remaining 59
tumors were scored as negative (no immunoreactivity or
immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells).
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the
patients according to INA expression (negative, positive,
or not assessed), and Table 2 illustrates the correlation
between INA expression and clinical, histologic, and molecular features. Positive INA expression was correlated
with the extent of surgery (SCC, 0.23; P ¼ .03), previous
resection for a low-grade glioma (SCC, 0.38; P ¼ .0002),
frontal involvement (SCC, 0.36; P ¼ .0004), absence of
necrosis (SSC, 0.37; P ¼ .0003), absence of high cellularity (SCC, 0.21; P ¼ .04), no glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) features on central review according to the
WHO 2007 glioma classification (SSC, 0.29;
P ¼ .009), 1p19q codeletion (SSC, 0.51; P ¼ .002), the
presence of IDH1 mutation (SSC, 0.47; P < .0001), no
EGFRamp (SSC, 0.31; P ¼ .006), no CHR10loss (SSC,
0.49; P < .0001), and MGMT promoter methylation
(SSC, 0.42; P ¼ .002).
Prognostic Impact of INA
Patients who were positive for INA expression had a longer PFS (median, 50.4 months compared with 6.6
months for INA-negative patients) and a longer OS (median not reached compared with 16 months, respectively)
regardless of the treatment received (Table 3). The prognostic hazard ratio (HR) for INA expression was 0.26 (ie,
a 74% risk reduction; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.14-0.42) for PFS (P<104) and 0.19 (95% CI, 0.100.37) for OS (P<104). When we considered only the 56
patients who had a confirmed central review diagnosis of
OIII or OAIII without necrosis, patients with INA expression also had both longer PFS (median 66.2 months vs
6.2 months for INA-negative patients) and longer OS
(median not reached vs 16 months, respectively) regardless of the treatment received. The prognostic HR for
INA expression was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.13-0.51) for PFS
(P<104) and 0.18 (95%CI, 0.08-0.41) for OS
(P<104). In contrast, INA expression did not have any
impact on PFS (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.32-3.77; P ¼ .88) or
OS (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.47-5.59; P ¼ .44) for patients
who had a confirmed central review diagnosis as GBM or
AOA with necrosis (n ¼ 25) (Fig. 2). The interaction test

There were 183 patients in the radiotherapy plus procarbazine, lomustine,
and vincristine arm and 185 patients in the radiotherapy alone arm who
were assessable for PFS.

among the 38 patients without IDH1 mutation, INA
expression was correlated with longer PFS and OS
(Fig. 4). The interaction test was not significant for PFS
(P ¼ .4) or OS (P ¼ .78) (Table 4).
In multivariate prognostic factor analyses of PFS, 51
patients (14% of the entire study population) had complete information for the 8 factors that passed the 1% significance cutoff level: ie, INA expression (P < .0001),
IDH1/IDH2 mutation (P ¼ .0002), type of surgery

were selected when IDH1 mutation was not entered into
the model (data not shown).
For OS, factors that were screened by univariate
analyses (P<1%) were INA expression (P < .0001),
IDH1/IDH2 mutation (P ¼ .0004), type of surgery
(P ¼ .0016), WHO PS (P ¼ .0036), prior surgery for
low-grade glioma (P ¼ .0083), presence of necrosis
(P ¼ .006), tumor location (P ¼ .0004), EGFRamp
(P ¼ .003), CHR10q loss or CHR10loss (P ¼ .0002), and
1p/19q loss (P ¼ .0006). By using a stepwise technique,
INA (HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.03-0.26; P < .0001; PI, 78%)
and WHO PS (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.44-8.39, P ¼ .006;
PI, 73%) were selected (Table 5).
Predictive Value of INA for Response to
RT 1 PCV
When considering separately patients according to INA
expression, the treatment effect appeared to differ between
patients who were positive and negative for INA. In INApositive patients (n ¼ 33), the treatment HR was 0.37
(95% CI, 0.14-0.98; P ¼ .04) for PFS and 0.33 (95% CI,
0.10-1.14; P ¼ .07) for OS (Table 6). Patients who
received RT þ PCV had a median PFS of 68.2 months
versus 43.4 months for those who received RT alone. The
median OS was not reached in the RT þ PCV arm compared with 59.4 months in the RT arm.
In INA-negative patients (n ¼ 59), the treatment
HR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.40-1.16; P ¼ .15) for PFS and
1.07 (95% CI, 0.62-1.85; P ¼ .81) for OS. The median
PFS for INA-negative patients was 7.8 months in the
RT þ PCV arm versus 5.8 months in the RT arm, and the
median OS was 16 months versus 15.8 months, respectively (Fig. 5). The interaction test was not significant for
PFS (P ¼ .25) and was borderline significant for OS
(P ¼ .08).
In patients who did not have INA expression
assessed (n ¼ 276), the treatment effect was significant
(P ¼ .02) for PFS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95), and
the effect was not significant (P ¼ .53) for OS (HR, 0.90;
95% CI, 0.66-1.24). This potential predictive effect of
INA expression was present only when we considered the
56 patients who had a confirmed central review diagnosis
of OIII or OAIII without necrosis. In this subgroup,
INA-positive patients in the RT þ PCV arm (n ¼ 12) had

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we analyzed the prognostic and predictive value of INA expression in a subset of patients who
were enrolled in the EORTC 26951 trial. A poorer outcome was observed for the patients who had tissue samples
available for INA assessment: This group was characterized by more patients with a worse PS who frequently had
tumors with more mitoses, EGFRamp, CHR7poly, and
CHR10loss, factors that may have accounted for the difference in outcome. Because most of the samples came from
a limited number of Dutch and French sites, there may
have been a center bias in the diagnosis of oligodendroglial tumors.
Validation of a new marker in a randomized controlled trial provides an opportunity to determine whether
there is an effect independent of treatment modality
(prognostic) from an effect related to a specific modality
(predictive)—here, adjuvant PCV chemotherapy. Our
data indicate that INA expression is a very strong prognostic factor in patients who have OIII and OAIII without
necrosis. The data also suggest that INA expression may
be a predictive marker of chemosensitivity. The technique
used here may not discriminate a ‘‘false’’ 1p19q signature
(ie, partial distal 1p deletion, which may be associated
with loss of chromosome 19) from the ‘‘true’’ 1p19q signature (ie, loss of the whole 1p and 19q). We analyzed a
comparative genomic hybridization array (CGHa) on a
subset of 23 tumors and identified 5 complete 1p and 19q
deletions. It is noteworthy that INA expression was related
more closely to the CGHa (P ¼ .001) than to FISH
(P ¼ .025). INA expression also was related closely to
MGMT promoter methylation and IDH1/IDH2 mutation, as expected. Indeed, it has been established that all 3
alterations are related.13 In fact, previous studies based on
the EORTC 26951 trial demonstrated previously that not
only 1p19q codeletion but also MGMT promoter methylCancer

July 1, 2011

ation and IDH1/IDH2 mutation are strongly correlated
with a better outcome, whereas none of these molecular
markers were predictive of chemosensitivity.1,9,10 However, MGMT promoter methylation reportedly was predictive of chemosensitivity in patients with glioblastoma
who received concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide.14
The finding that the PCV regimen had to be reduced in
most patients and had to be stopped prematurely for toxicity in 38% of patients may have weakened the impact of
adjuvant therapy.1 Consequently, the toxicity of the PCV
regimen may have obscured a potential predictive effect of
these markers. In this context, our data suggesting a possible predictive value of INA for RT þ PCV, particularly
for OS, are particularly interesting. The ongoing EORTC
26053 (CATNON) trial, which is evaluating concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide in patients who have
grade III glioma without the 1p/19q codeletion, offers a
unique opportunity to test the predictive value of INA
and other markers in a near future.
In conclusion, our current results indicate that INA
immunohistochemistry has clear prognostic value in grade
III oligodendroglial tumors. Because such immunohistochemistry can be performed quickly on a simple biopsy, is
reliable and inexpensive, and does not require any special
equipment, this approach may provide a valuable diagnostic tool. In addition, we have demonstrated that INA
expression also is prognostic in patients with IDH1 nonmutated glioma. It is noteworthy that antibodies directed
against the IDH1 arginine-to-histidine substitution in
codon 132 (R132H) have been developed recently.15
Therefore, both INA and IDH1 R132H can be assessed
easily by using immunohistochemistry in clinical practice.
However, the exact prognostic and predictive significance
of INA status in patients with diffuse gliomas needs to be
determined in further studies.
