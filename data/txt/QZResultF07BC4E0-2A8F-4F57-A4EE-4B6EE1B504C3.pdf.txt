ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related female deaths. Due
to serious side effects, relapse and resistance to standard chemotherapy, better and
more targeted approaches are required. Mutation of the TP53 gene accounts for
50% of all human cancers. In the remaining malignancies, non-genotoxic activation
of wild-type p53 by small molecule inhibition of the MDM2-p53 binding interaction
is a promising therapeutic strategy. Proof of concept was established with the cisimidazoline Nutlin-3, leading to the development of RG7388 and other compounds
currently in early phase clinical trials. This preclinical study evaluated the effect of
Nutlin-3 and RG7388 as single agents and in combination with cisplatin in a panel
of ovarian cancer cell lines. Median-drug-effect analysis showed Nutlin-3 or RG7388
combination with cisplatin was additive to, or synergistic in a p53-dependent manner,
resulting in increased p53 activation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, associated with
increased p21WAF1 protein and/or caspase-3/7 activity compared to cisplatin alone.
Although MDM2 inhibition activated the expression of p53-dependent DNA repair
genes, the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of p53 dominated the response.
These data indicate that combination treatment with MDM2 inhibitors and cisplatin has
synergistic potential for the treatment of ovarian cancer, dependent on cell genotype.

TP53 mutation is the most frequent genetic abnormality in
ovarian cancer, which accounts for 60% of ovarian cancers,
with a particularly high prevalence in high grade serous
tumors. In the remaining malignancies, p53 function is held
in check through other mechanisms and reactivation of p53
is a potential therapeutic strategy (reviewed by [5]).
MDM2 is the main negative regulator of p53,
regulating p53 through ubiquitin dependent degradation.
The imidazoline Nutlin-3, was the first non-genotoxic
specific small-molecule antagonist of the MDM2-p53
binding interaction to be developed [6] and has been
used extensively as a probe compound in preclinical and
mechanistic studies. RG7388 was subsequently developed
as a second generation MDM2 inhibitor with superior
potency, selectivity and oral bioavailability suitable for
clinical development to inhibit the MDM2-p53 interaction
and activate the p53 pathway [7, 8]. These compounds
target a small hydrophobic pocket on MDM2, to which

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of all gynecological
malignancies and was reported to be responsible for
approximately 152,000 deaths worldwide in 2012 [1].
Although patients with primary disease respond to platinum
and taxane chemotherapy, relapse and resistance to treatment
is prevalent, leading to lack of long-term benefit from
treatment. For this reason, molecular alterations in tumors,
particularly those involved in growth signaling pathways,
cell cycle progression and apoptosis are being investigated to
potentially exploit for targeted therapy (reviewed by [2, 3]).
The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is referred to as
the most frequently altered gene in human cancers. It has
been substantially established that p53 protects cells against
environmental and intra-cellular stress stimuli by playing a
central role in regulating cell cycle control, differentiation,
proliferation, DNA repair and apoptosis (reviewed by [4]).

p53 normally binds, leading to p53 stabilization and
upregulation of p53 downstream transcriptional targets
involved in cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, including
genes encoding p21WAF1, BAX and BBC3 (PUMA)
[9, 10]. Using MDM2-p53 antagonists as single-agent
therapy has been suggested to be potentially limited due
to acquisition of resistance through continuous exposure
to MDM2 inhibitors followed by de novo mutations
[11] and (reviewed by [12]). It is therefore logical to
consider using MDM2 antagonists in combination with
established therapeutic agents to improve treatment with
the possibility of dose reduction and less normal tissue
cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. In the context of ovarian
cancer it is of interest to investigate the combination of
cisplatin and MDM2 inhibitors, particularly as individually
these agents have different dose limiting toxicities.
The aim of the present study was to test a panel of
established ovarian cancer cell lines for their response to
MDM2-p53 antagonists, Nutlin-3 and RG7388, alone and
in combination with cisplatin and examine the mechanistic
basis of these responses in relation to the genotype and
induced gene expression of the cells.

concentration-dependent manner and confirmed functional
activation of wild-type p53 by release from MDM2.
However, as anticipated, it had no effect on p53-dependent
gene expression in the TP53-mutant cell lines with the
delivered dose range of Nutlin-3/RG7388. Interestingly
this was despite a small increase in stabilization of mutant
p53 in response to RG7388 at the doses of 0.1 and 0.5 µM
with the CP70 and MLH1-corrected CP70+ cell lines. This
result indicates that some forms of mutant p53 are still
targeted for degradation by MDM2 even though they have
lost their transcriptional function. Also, there is a frameshift deletion in the SKOV-3 cell line (Table 1) leading
to an absence of detectable p53, p21WAF1 and MDM2
expression (Figure 1B, 1C).

Nutlin-3/RG7388 synergizes with cisplatin for
growth inhibition of wild-type TP53 ovarian
cancer cell lines
The effect of Nutlin-3/RG7388 in combination
with cisplatin was investigated for 3 wild-type TP53
ovarian cancer cell lines using Median-effect analysis.
The sensitivity of these TP53 wild-type cell lines to
growth inhibition during 72 hours exposure to Nutlin-3,
RG7388 and cisplatin was determined as single agents,
and in combination at 5 equipotent concentrations
between 0.25× and 4× their respective GI50 concentrations.
The effect of combined treatment was cell type and
compound dependent. Combination of Nutlin-3/RG7388
with cisplatin at all concentrations led to greater growth
inhibition compared to either agent alone for the
A2780 cell line. Combination treatment of OAW42 and
IGROV-1 cell lines also produced more growth arrest
at concentrations equal to or lower than the individual
1xGI50 dose (Figure 2A & 2B). To determine whether the
observed differences in growth inhibition were additive
or synergistic, the data were analyzed using median-effect
analysis and Combination Index (CI) and Dose Reduction
Index (DRI) values calculated.
CI values for each constant ratio combination and
at effect levels of ED50, ED75 and ED90 were computed.
Also, the average of CI values at ED50, ED75 and ED90
was determined (Table 2 and Figure 2C). Across all cell
lines, the effect of combination treatment of Nutlin-3/
RG7388 with cisplatin ranged from additive to synergistic
based on the CI at ED50. Although the effect of combined
treatment based on overall CI was synergism for
A2780, it was antagonism for IGROV-1 and OAW42
(Table 2 and Figure 2C). The data analysis showed there
was a favourable dose reduction index (DRI), which
demonstrates how many-fold the dose of each drug in a
combination treatment may be reduced to achieve a given
effect level compared with the doses of each drug alone
(Table 3). Both Nutlin-3, and RG7388 had favorable DRI
values for combined treatment with cisplatin, with most
experimental values ranging from 1.1-fold to 6.9-fold dose

RESULTS
Wild-type TP53 ovarian cancer cell lines are
sensitive to Nutlin-3/RG7388
Growth inhibition by Nutlin-3/RG7388 was
investigated using the sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay
for a panel of wild-type and mutant TP53 ovarian cancer
cell lines derived from tumours of different histological
subtypes [13-16] (Figure 1A and Table 1). The required
concentration of each compound leading to 50% growth
inhibition (GI50) showed that wild-type TP53 ovarian
cancer cell lines were significantly more sensitive to
Nutlin-3/RG7388 compared to mutant, which is consistent
with their mechanism of action (p<0.0001 Mann-Whitney
test). Also, RG7388 was more potent compared to Nutlin-3
(p<0.0001 Mann-Whitney test). The GI50 values for
wild-type TP53 cell lines for RG7388 and Nutlin-3 were
in the nanomolar range ( 253.3 ± 73.1 (SEM) nM) and
micromolar range (1.76 ± 0.51 (SEM) µM) respectively.
In contrast, TP53 mutant cell lines had GI50 values greater
than 10 μM (17.8 ± 2.9 (SEM) μM) for RG7388 and range
21.2-˃30 μM for Nutlin-3 (Table 1 and Figure 1A).

Functional activation of the p53 pathway in wildtype TP53 ovarian cancer cell lines in response to
Nutlin-3/RG7388
The p53-dependent response to Nutlin-3/RG7388
assessed by Western blotting (Figure 1B, 1C) showed
that Nutlin-3/RG7388 induced stabilization of p53
and upregulation of p21WAF1 and MDM2 protein levels

demonstrating a significant individual drug dose reduction
may be achieved for a given combination therapeutic
effect, compared with the dose of either drug alone as a
single agent to obtain the same therapeutic effect.

Further analysis was performed to investigate the

pathway using Western blotting. Wild-type TP53 cell
lines were treated with Nutlin-3/RG7388 and cisplatin
alone, and in combination at constant 1:1 ratios of 1x
and 2x their respective GI50 concentration for 4 hours.
Western analysis showed that treatment with Nutlin-3/
RG7388 and cisplatin as a single agent and in combination
induced p53 stabilization and upregulation of p21WAF1 and
MDM2, confirming functional activation of wild-type p53
(Figure 3). Moreover, combination treatment in all cases
led to greater levels of p53 stabilization, as well as p21WAF1
and MDM2 upregulation compared to cisplatin on its own,
and in most cases these were greater than those induced
by Nutlin-3/RG7388 alone. Higher expression of p21WAF1
for combined treatment was associated with a greater
synergistic effect for growth inhibition. However, Nutlin-3
and RG7388 led to little change in BAX expression
compared to DMSO control, and their combination with
cisplatin showed only a small increase in the expression
of BAX compared to cisplatin on its own (Figure 3).
Interestingly, cisplatin alone at a GI50 or 2x GI50 dose
showed much less p53 pathway induction than Nutlin-3
or RG7388 alone.

Wild-type TP53 cell lines were treated with
Nutlin-3/RG7388 and cisplatin, alone and in combination
at constant 1:1 ratios of 1x and 2x (1/2 x & 1x for OAW42)
their respective GI50 concentration for 24, 48 and 72 hours.
They were then analyzed by flow cytometry for cell cycle
phase distribution changes and evidence of apoptosis in
response to treatment. The 48 and 72 hour treatment data
is presented in the Supplementary Figures (S1–S4).
For the wild-type TP53 cell lines, Nutlin-3 only
showed a modest increase in the proportion of cells in G0/
G1 phase in a dose and time dependent manner. Nutlin-3
also increased the percentage of SubG1 events, a surrogate
marker of apoptosis, in A2780 and IGROV-1 cell lines in
a treatment time and dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A
& 4B, Supplementary Figure S1B and Supplementary
Figure S2B). For A2780 and IGROV-1 cells, combination
treatment of Nutlin-3 with cisplatin led to a dose and time

µM) and OAW42 (LC50= 6.25 ± 0.50 (SEM) µM) were
substantially less sensitive to Nutlin-3 (Figure 6A).
RG7388 was much more potent than Nutlin-3,
and decreased the clonogenic survival of all the wildtype TP53 ovarian cancer cell lines. Consistent with the
mechanism of action for MDM2 antagonists, RG7388
had little or no effect on mutant TP53 cell lines in the
0-2µM dose range (Figure 6B). Interestingly, although
all three cell lines were sensitive to RG7388, the relative
sensitivity of the wild-type TP53 cell lines to Nutlin-3 and
RG7388 was very different. The clonogenic cell survival
response to RG7388 for A2780 and OAW42 was similar,
whereas for Nutlin-3 their relative responses were quite

different, with only A2780 showing sensitivity to Nutlin-3.
Overall, the clonogenic cell survival assays showed
not only that mutant TP53 genomic status was a major
determinant of resistance to Nutlin-3 and RG7388, but
also that the relative response of the wild-type TP53 cell
lines differed for the two MDM2 inhibitors in a way that
was not explicable simply by the relative potency of the
compounds in cell-free MDM2-p53 binding assays.

both as single agents and in combination at five equipotent

were used to assess the combination effect of Nutlin-3
with cisplatin. The effect of combined treatment was cell
type and compound dependent (Figure 7A & 7B). The
combination of Nutlin-3 with cisplatin led to a further
decrease in colony formation compared to treatment
with either agent alone for all three cell lines and was
particularly marked for IGROV1.
Although the combination of Nutlin-3 with
cisplatin significantly decreased the clonogenic survival
of IGROV-1 and A2780 compared to either agent alone,
the combined treatment of RG7388 with cisplatin at
the same LC50 ratios only moderately reduced colony
formation (Figure 7A & 7B). For the OAW42 cell line, the
combination treatment of Nutlin-3 with cisplatin reduced
the ability of the OAW42 cell line to form colonies to a
greater extent than either agent on its own. In contrast,
there was no significant reduction in the clonogenic cell
survival of OAW42 following combination treatment
with RG7388 and cisplatin compared to either agent alone
(Figure 7A & 7B).
The data were analyzed using median-effect analysis
and CI values calculated to evaluate whether the observed
differences in clonogenic cell survival were synergistic,
additive or antagonistic. CI values for each constant ratio
combination at estimated effect levels of ED50, ED75 and
ED90 were individually computed, and the average of CI
values was also determined. Across all three wild-type
TP53 cell lines, the effect of combination treatment of
Nutlin-3 with cisplatin ranged from additive to strongly
synergistic (Table 5 and Figure 7C). In addition, for
combination treatments, both Nutlin-3 and cisplatin had
a favorable DRI ranging from 1.3-fold to 10.9-fold dose
reduction (Table 6).
For A2780 and IGROV-1 cell lines a synergistic
effect was observed for combination treatment with
Nutlin-3 and cisplatin, whereas for RG7388 and cisplatin
combinations the effect was additive to antagonistic.
For the OAW42 cell line the combination of RG7388
and cisplatin was antagonistic, suggesting RG7388
had a protective effect against cisplatin (Table 5 and
Figure  7C). Although the combined effect of RG7388
with cisplatin ranged from additive to antagonistic, there
was nevertheless a favorable DRI for the same level of
clonogenic cell killing when treatments are combined for
all RG7388 concentrations and most concentrations of
cisplatin (Table 6).

reaction (qRT-PCR). Changes in the expression of cell
cycle/apoptosis-related genes as well as those involved
in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and mismatch repair
(MMR) for the three wild-type TP53 cell lines in response
to Nutlin-3 and RG7388 are shown in Figure 8 & 9. The
cells were treated with 5 (µM) Nutlin-3 and 0.5 (µM)
RG7388, and the total RNA was extracted 6 hours after
the commencement of treatment.
Overall, the fold changes in expression in response
to MDM2 inhibitors were less in A2780 cells than
IGROV-1 and OAW42 (Figure 8 & 9). In the case of the
genes involved in cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition,
Nutlin-3 and RG7388 treatment significantly induced
CDKN1A, SESN1 and GADD45A gene expression in
all three cell lines, with CDKN1A consistently showing
the highest level of induction (p<0.05) (Figure 8 & 9).
Both treatments showed a significant increase in the
expression of the pro-apoptotic TNFRSF10B and BBC3
(PUMA) genes in all three cell lines, with increases of
BBC3 mRNA being highest in the IGROV-1 cell line
(p<0.05) (Figure 8). The Nutlin-3/RG7388 treatment also
increased expression of the pro-apoptotic gene TP53INP1
in A2780 and OAW42 cells; however, there was no
significant induction in IGROV-1. No significant increase
was observed for the pro-apoptotic gene BAX in any of
the cell lines. Although Nutlin-3/RG7388 treatment led to
significantly increased expression of AEN in IGROV-1,
the induction of AEN was not statistically significant
for A2780 and OAW42 (Figure 8). Furthermore, both
Nutlin-3 and RG7388 treatments significantly increased
the expression of the anti-apoptotic MDM2 gene across
all three cell lines. The treatments led to a statistically
significant decrease in the expression of BCL-2 although
the changes were small and unlikely to be biologically
significant. Also no significant changes were observed
in the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic BIRC5 and
MCL-1 genes (Supplementary Figure S5).
To study the effect of Nutlin-3 and RG7388 on
the expression of genes implicated in the response to
DNA repair induced by cisplatin, the expression of
TP53BP1, DDB2, ERCC1, XPC, MLH1, MSH2, RAD51
and RRM2B genes in response to Nutlin-3 and RG7388
was investigated. A significant increase was measured
in the expression of DDB2 in response to Nutlin-3 and
XPC in response to both Nutlin-3 and RG7388 for
A2780 cells (p<0.05). In the case of IGROV-1, XPC
and MSH2 gene expression levels were significantly
induced and reduced respectively in response to both
Nutlin-3 and RG7388 (p<0.05). For OAW42 cells there
was a significant increase in the expression of DDB2
and XPC genes and a significant decrease in the MLH1
and MSH2 expression levels in response to Nutlin-3 and
RG7388 treatment (p<0.05). With Nutlin-3 treatment,
the TP53BP1 gene expression decreased in all three cell
lines, although statistically this trend was not significant
(p>0.05).

Nutlin-3 in combination with cisplatin in wild-type TP53
ovarian cancer cell lines and explores the mechanistic
basis for the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic responses.
Within the panel of ovarian cancer cell lines studied,
wild-type TP53 cell lines were significantly more sensitive
to Nutlin-3 and the more potent RG7388 compared to
mutant TP53 cell lines. Consistent with their mechanism
of action, Nutlin-3 and RG7388 treatment led to more
p53 stabilization and induction of p21WAF1 and MDM2 in
the wild-type TP53 ovarian cancer cell lines. There was
no upregulation of p53 downstream target genes in TP53
mutant ovarian cancer cell lines in response to Nutlin-3
and RG7388 treatment [20]. Interestingly, despite the
lack of downstream function, there was some evidence
of mutant p53 stabilization in response to treatment with
MDM2 inhibitors in the TP53 mutant CP70 and MLH1corrected CP70+ cell lines. This suggests some mutant
forms of p53 still show evidence of degradation by MDM2
which is prevented by the MDM2 inhibitors. These results
are consistent with limited previous studies [10, 21]
demonstrating that wild-type TP53 ovarian cancer cell
lines are responsive to Nutlin-3 and extends observations
to the second generation MDM2 inhibitor RG7388
currently in early phase clinical trials.
Resistance to MDM2-p53 binding antagonists has
been suggested to be acquired by prolonged exposure of
cells to sub-lethal doses through de novo inactivating TP53
mutations or selection of pre-existing subclones of TP53
mutant cells that might be present as a result of cancer
cell genomic instability and tumor heterogeneity [22, 23].
For this reason, it is suggested that MDM2-antagonists
are likely be most effective in combination with standard
existing chemotherapeutic agents or agents that target or
limit the potential outgrowth of TP53 mutated cells. The
major benefits of combination therapy are the potential
for a synergistic therapeutic effect, dose and toxicity
reduction, and delay or prevention of drug resistance
[24, 25]. Platinum agents used to treat ovarian cancer
have major adverse side effects including nephrotoxicity,
ototoxicity, myelosuppression and gastrointestinal
disorders [26]. This study set out with the aim of assessing
the effect of single and combination treatment of Nutlin-3
and RG7388 with cisplatin in a panel of ovarian cancer
cell lines of known TP53 status. The effects observed
were compound and cell type dependent. Overall, the
combination effect of Nutlin-3 and RG7388 with cisplatin
ranged from synergism in A2780 and moderate synergism
to antagonism in IGROV-1 and OAW42 cell lines.
A single limited previous study examined the combination
of Nutlin-3a with cisplatin in A2780p, A2780cis and the
OV90 cell lines. The results showed a synergistic effect
in A2780p and A2780cis, consistent with our study [10].
Even in the absence of synergy, combined treatment
can nevertheless be of potential clinical use, because in
most cases a favorable dose reduction for each agent may
still be achievable for a given level of effect compared
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with each agent alone (Tables 3 and 6). This is of
particular potential benefit when the agents in question,
in this case MDM2 inhibitors and cisplatin, have different
dose limiting toxicities. [27].
The combination treatments increased stabilization
of p53 and upregulation of p21WAF1 compared to either
agent alone, particularly compared to cisplatin in A2780
and IGROV-1. However, there was no significant
increase in p53 stabilization and p21WAF1 upregulation
in combined treatment of OAW42 cells compared to
Nutlin-3 and RG7388 as single treatments. These results
help to understand the observed differences in the effect of
combined treatment on growth inhibition and clonogenic
cell survival between these cell lines. These findings are
in keeping with functional activation of p53 as a driver
of the synergistic effects in combination treatment. For
growth inhibition the increased upregulation of p21WAF1 is
consistent with its role in cell cycle arrest [28].
Individually, Nutlin-3 and RG7388 induced cell
cycle arrest in wild-type TP53 ovarian cancer cell lines
in a time and dose-dependent manner. When cells were
treated with the GI50 isoeffect doses of RG7388 or
Nutlin-3, RG7388 had a greater effect on the cell cycle
distribution, with increased accumulation of cells in G0/
G1. Combination treatment with Nutlin-3 or RG7388 and
cisplatin led to greater G2/M and/or G0/G1 cell cycle
phase accumulation, more SubG1 events and/or higher
levels of caspase 3/7 activity compared to either agent
alone in a cell type and time dependent manner. Overall,
there was a positive correlation between the detection of
SubG1 events on FACS analysis and caspase 3/7 activity,
however cell cycle arrest is not always accompanied by
the induction of apoptosis [29] as seen for OAW42 cells
in this study. The apparent protective effect of Nutlin-3/
RG7388 against cisplatin in OAW42, indicated by the
antagonistic effect of combination (Figure 2C and 7C),
was reflected by fewer SubG1 events and Caspase 3/7
activity compared to cisplatin on its own.
The clonogenic cell survival assays also showed
TP53 mutant cell lines were much more resistant to
Nutlin-3 and RG7388, but nevertheless also demonstrated
a range of different relative single agent responses for
the wild-type TP53 cell lines (Figure 6 and Table 4).
A possible explanation for this range of responses between
the wild-type TP53 cell lines might be due to differences
in drug uptake [30] or deficiencies or variation in the
expression of p53 target genes involved in apoptosis
and other mechanisms of cell death, including the proapoptotic proteins BAX and PUMA and anti-apoptotic
proteins BCL-2 and MCL-1 [31, 32].
Combined treatment with Nutlin-3 and cisplatin
significantly decreased the clonogenic survival of wildtype TP53 ovarian cancer cells compared with either agent
alone, and the combination effect ranged from additive
to strong synergy. Nutlin-3 may sensitize wild-type
TP53 ovarian cancer cell lines to cisplatin via multiple

factors including increased p53-dependent apoptosis
[33, 34]. Surprisingly, the combination of RG7388 with
cisplatin showed no evidence of synergy for reduction
of colony forming ability. The clonogenic assay results
for combination of RG7388 with cisplatin ranged from
antagonism for OAW42, indicating a protective effect
of RG7388 against cisplatin, to additive for A2780
and IGROV-1. The difference between the results for
combination of cisplatin with Nutlin-3 compared to
the combination with RG7388 may in part be due to
different p53-dependent off-target effects of these MDM2
inhibitors. A contributory factor may be differences
in G1 cell cycle arrest with MDM2 inhibitors, since an
increased G1 cell cycle arrest may protect against agents
such as cisplatin which are preferentially cytotoxic against
S-phase cells [35].
Across the 3 cell lines, Nutlin-3/RG7388
increased CDKN1A and SESN1 expression consistent
with their essential role in cell cycle arrest and growth
inhibition [36, 37]. Both Nutlin-3 and RG7388 treatment
significantly induced the expression of the pro-apoptotic
TNFRSF10B and BBC3 genes in all 3 cell lines. The
TNFRSF10B receptor and its ligand, TRAIL, have been
reported to preferentially induce apoptosis in transformed
and tumor cells even though it is expressed at a significant
level and may be induced in normal tissues [38, 39].
This may contribute to the generally greater toxicity of
MDM2 inhibitors for cancer cells compared to normal
cells, although some haematopoetic cell lineages also
appear to be sensitive, as evidenced by the dose limiting
thrombocytopenia seen in the early phase clinical trials of
MDM2 inhibitors [40]. There was a positive concordance
between the expression of these pro-apoptotic genes and
the apoptotic endpoints shown by Sub-G1 signals on
FACS analysis and caspase 3/7 activity in A2780 and
IGROV-1 cell lines. However, this relationship did not
extend to the OAW42 cell line, which despite increased
TNFRSF10B, TP53INP1 and the highest pro-apoptotic
BBC3 expression was not in keeping with low caspase
3/7 activity and SubG1 FACS signals. Failure to undergo
apoptosis in OAW42 cells in response to C1311, a new
class of imidazoacridinones, has also been reported,
consistent with our observation [41].
A possible explanation for the lack of evidence of
apoptosis in OAW42 might be high expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-X and MCL-1,
or deficiency in downstream factors involved in the
apoptosis cascade [27, 28]. Although BAX is required
for PUMA-induced apoptosis, there was no significant
increase in BAX expression, either at the mRNA or
protein level in response to Nutlin-3/RG7388 treatment
in any of the cell lines.
Significantly increased expression of several p53regulated genes involved in the repair of DNA lesions
induced by cisplatin, including DDB2, XPC and RRM2B,
lead us to reject the hypothesis that reduced capacity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for repair of cisplatin induced DNA damage leads to a
synergistic effect in combined treatment with Nutlin-3/
RG7388 and cisplatin. Although there was some evidence
of a reduced expression of the DNA mismatch repair
genes, MLH1 and MSH2, the changes were very small and
unlikely to be biologically significant.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that
RG7388 has activity as a single agent against wild-type
TP53 ovarian cancer cells, leading to cell cycle arrest
and/or apoptosis. In addition, combination treatment with
MDM2 inhibitors and cisplatin has synergistic and/or
dose reduction potential dependent on cell genotype and
compound and merits further investigation. Our study
clearly indicates that the presence of wild-type TP53
remains the main predictive biomarker of response to
MDM2 inhibitors. However, additional determinants of
response involve the balance of activity between growth
inhibitory/pro-survival and pro-apoptotic genes and our
results indicate that this dominates the small changes in
the expression of DNA repair genes as an explanation
for the synergy observed for treatment with cisplatin and
MDM2 inhibitors.

IGROV-1, OAW42 and CP70 were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 5% (v/v)
penicillin/streptomycin. The CP70 cell line harbors a
heterozygous TP53 mutation (c.514 G->T, p.Val172Phe)
[42].The MLH1-corrected CP70+ cell line was grown
in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and
Hygromycin B (200 µg/ml: Life Technologies, Inc.) [42].
This cell line has the heterozygous TP53 mutation (c.514
G->T, p.Val172Phe). SKOV-3 and MDAH-2774 cell lines
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% and
5% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin respectively.
As information on the TP53 status of SKOV-3 in the
literature was contradictory, sequencing was performed
and a frame shift deletion (c.265delC, p.Pro89fsX33) was

washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 μL PBS with
1mg/mL sodium citrate (Sigma, St Louis, MO), 100
µg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma), 200 µg/mL RNAse
A (Sigma) and 0.3% Triton-X (Sigma). Samples were
analyzed on a FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer using
CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK).
Cell cycle distribution was determined using Cyflogic
(CyFlo Ltd, Turku, Finland).

Growth inhibition assays and median-effect
analysis
The GI50 values, the required concentrations of
each compound leading to 50% growth inhibition, were
determined by Sulforhodamine B (SRB) growth inhibition
assays for drug exposure over 72 hours and the absorbance
of the re-dissolved SRB protein stain was measured at 570
nm using a 96-well plate spectrophotometer (Spectramax
250 Molecular Devices) [44]. Growth curves were
constructed using GraphPad Prism statistical analysis
software version 5.04. For combination treatment of
Nutlin-3 or RG7388 with cisplatin, the wild-type TP53
cell lines were treated for 72 hours with each agent
alone and in combination simultaneously at constant
1:1 ratios of 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, and 4x their respective
GI50 concentrations. Median-effect analysis was used to
calculate Combination Index (CI) and Dose Reduction
Index (DRI) values [27] using CalcuSyn software v2
(Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

Clonogenic cell survival assay
Based on the drug concentration and sensitivity of
cell lines, 100 to 100,000 cells were seeded into triplicate
six-well plates. Cells were treated with Nutlin-3, RG7388
and cisplatin alone and in combination at constant 1:1
ratios of 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x and 4x or 0.25x, 0.5x and 1x
their respective LC50 concentrations, depending on the cell
line and its single agent LC50 values, for 48 hours. Then,
the medium including drug was removed and drug-free
medium was added. The cells were incubated for 2 to 3
weeks to form colonies for counting (a colony was defined
as a focus of ≥50 cells). After that, the plates were washed
with PBS, fixed with methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and
stained with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet. Plates were again
washed and then left at room temperature to dry. The LC50
values were calculated using GraphPad Prism statistical
analysis software version 5.04. DRI and CI values were
calculated by median-effect analysis [27] using CalcuSyn
software v2 (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

Western blotting
Lysis buffer (12.5 ml Tris HCL, 2g SDS, 10 ml
Glycerol, 67.5 ml Distilled Water) was used to harvest
whole-cell lysates, followed by sonication. The concentration
of protein in the cell lysates was estimated by using a
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Novex® 4-20% TrisGlycine 12-well polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen,
UK) were used to separate proteins. The separated proteins
were transferred by perpendicular electrophoresis to
a nitrocellulose HybondTM C membrane (Amersham,
Buckinghamshire, UK). Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human
primary antibodies Actin 1:1000 (#: A4700, Sigma-Aldrich),
MDM2 1:300 (#: OP46-100UG, Merck Millipore), p21WAF1
1:100 (#: OP64, Calbiochem), p53 1:500 (#: NCL-L-p53DO7, Leica Microsystems Ltd.) and Polyclonal Rabbit
Anti-Human primary antibody BAX 1:1000 (#: 2772S,
Cell Signalling) were used. Secondary goat anti-mouse/
rabbit HRP-conjugated antibodies (#: P0447/P0448, Dako)
were used at 1:1000. All antibodies were diluted in 5%
milk/1XTBS-Tween (w/v). Enhanced chemiluminescence
(GE Life Sciences) and X-ray film (Fujifilm) were used to
visualize the proteins.

Caspase 3/7 activity assay
Caspase 3/7 activity was measured using a CaspaseGlo 3/7 assay following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega, Southampton, UK).

qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Germany). RNA purity and concentration were
estimated with an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies, Thermo Scientific, UK). Total messenger
RNA was converted to cDNA using the Promega Reverse
Transcription System (A3500, Promega) as described by
the manufacturer. Validated primers used (Sigma-Aldrich
UK) are listed in Supplemental Table 1 & 2. qRT-PCR was
carried out using SYBR® green RT-PCR master mix (Life
technologies) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
PCR reactions with 50ng/μl of the cDNA samples per 10μl
final reaction volume, were performed using standard cycling
parameters (Stage 1: 50˚C for 2min, Stage 2: 95˚C for 10min
then 40 cycles of 95˚C for 15 Sec and 60˚C for 1 min) on
an ABI 7900HT sequence detection system. GAPDH was
used as endogenous control and the DMSO solvent control
sample used as the calibrator for each independent repeat.
Data analysis using the ΔΔCt Method was carried out using
SDS 2.2 software (Applied Biosystems).

Flow cytometry
Cells were treated with Nutlin-3, RG7388 and
cisplatin alone and with combinations of Nutlin-3 or
RG7388 with cisplatin simultaneously at constant 1:1
ratios of 1x and 2x (A2780 and IGROV-1) or 0.5x and
1x (OAW42) their respective GI50 concentrations for 24,
48 and 72 hours. Cells harvested by trypsinisation were
