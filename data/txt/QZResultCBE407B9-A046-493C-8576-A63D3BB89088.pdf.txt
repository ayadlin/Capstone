ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common cancer of the liver with a
very poor prognosis. The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRs) is indeed implicated in
HCC onset and progression. In this study, we have evaluated the expression of miR23b and miR-193a in a large cohort of 59 and 67 HCC patients, respectively. miR23b and miR-193a resulted significantly down-regulated in primary HCCs compared
to their matched peritumoral counterparts. Furthermore, patients with higher miR193a expression exhibited longer OS and DFS, suggesting that miR-193a may be a
molecular prognostic factor for HCC patients. Since the regulation of miRs by DNA
methylation may occur in human cancers, we verified whether the down-modulation of
miR-23b and miR-193a in HCC tissues could be related to DNA methylation. An inverse
trend between miR-23b expression and DNA methylation was observed, indicating
that miR-23b can be epigenetically regulated. By contrast, the down-regulation of
miR-193a was not mediated by DNA methylation. To verify the potential role of miR23b and miR-193a as responsive molecular targets in vitro, we used the inhibitor
of DNA methylation 5-aza-dC to restore miR-23b expression level in combination
with miR-193a transfection. The combined treatment led to a significant inhibition of
cellular proliferation and migration. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that
miR-23b and miR-193a may be molecular diagnostic and prognostic factors for HCC;
furthermore, miR-23b and miR-193a are responsive molecular targets for limiting
HCC cell aggressiveness in combination with the epigenetic drug 5-aza-dC. Moreover,
our results provide new advances in the epigenetic regulation of these miRs in HCC.

and chemoembolization are widely used as loco-regional
therapeutic strategies. The sole systemic treatment
available against advanced HCC is the oral multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib that prolongs the overall survival (OS)
of HCC patients from 7.9 to 10.7 months [5, 6]. However,
some patients develop resistance to sorafenib suggesting
that innovative molecular therapies are urgently needed.
In the last decade, several data from high throughput
analyses have delineated the landscape of genetic
alterations of HCC, providing important insights into the
characterization of possible biomarkers and targets in
order to improve prognosis of HCC patients. However,
actually, none of this knowledge is translated into clinical

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
common type of primary liver cancer and it accounts
for 80-90% of total cases. HCC represents the third
leading cause of cancer death worldwide and due to poor
prognosis and high incidence, it represents a malignancy
of global importance [1, 2]. To date, surgical resection and
orthotopic liver transplantation are considered the only
possibly curative therapies for early stage HCC. However,
only one third of patients are eligible for these therapies
and long term results are not completely satisfactory [3, 4].

practice [7]. Consequently, a more in-depth understanding
of HCC onset and progression is paramount to identify
responsive molecular therapeutic targets.
Similarly, with other tumors, the pathogenesis
of HCC is a multistep process that starts from preneoplastic lesions that progress in HCC. The exposure
to risk factors that determine or aggravate the chronic
inflammation of the liver contributes to the accumulation
of genetic and epigenetic alterations. This may result in
activation of oncogenes, silencing of tumor suppressors
genes, in microRNAs and in other non-coding RNAs
dysregulation [8, 9]
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous,
small non-coding RNAs (19-22 nucleotides in length)
that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional
level, playing an important role in physiological
processes, such as differentiation, apoptosis and cell
growth. Several studies demonstrated that miRNAs are
dysregulated in many types of cancers and contribute to
tumorigenesis functioning both as tumor suppressor genes
both as oncogenes (OncomiRs). Additionally, molecular
approaches based on miRNAs may constitute a promising
strategy for the treatment of solid tumors by relying on the
ability of miRNAs to target different oncogenes at the same
time [10, 11]. In recent years, the epigenetic regulation of
miRNAs has been reported for many types of cancers. The
enhancement of methods for measuring DNA methylation
at specific genomic loci allowed the identification of DNA
hyper-methylation of CpG sites within CpG islands as a
mechanism involved in the down-regulation of miRNAs
[12–14]. Interestingly, Kozaki and colleagues found
that 11.6% (122/1048) of miRNAs were epigenetically
regulated in 23 cancer types and that 19.5% of miRNA
coding sequences had a CpG island within 5 kb upstream
[15]. In 2008 Datta et al. individuated the first miRNA
silenced by hypermethylation in HCC cells and tissues,
miR-1 [16]. They also demonstrated that the ectopic
expression of miR-1 in HCC cells reduced their aggressive
properties and that the treatment with hypomethylating
agent 5-Azacytidine induced the down-regulation of the
miRNA targets FoxP1, MET and HDAC4. Subsequently
also miR-129-2, miR-124, miR-203, miR-125b, miR-34b
and miR-200b were recognized as novel tumor suppressor
miRNAs epigenetically silenced in HCC [17–21].
In the context of microRNA and HCC, our previous
results identified miR-193a as a negative regulator of
urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) [22] and
miR-23b as a negative co-regulator of uPA and MET (a
receptor tyrosine kinase, RTK) [23], that are considered
both unfavourable prognostic factors in HCC patients
[24]. In this study, we first examined the expression
of miR-23b and miR-193a in a large number of HCC
specimens to explore their possible role as diagnostic
and prognostic tissue molecular markers. Next, since
bioinformatics analysis showed the presence of CpG
islands near the coding sequences of these miRNAs we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

verified whether the DNA methylation was involved in the
regulation of miR-23b and miR-193a expression in HCC.
Recent studies aimed at the development of anti-cancer
molecular approaches based on epigenetic drugs, included
the inhibitor of DNA methylation 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine
(5-aza-dC, Decitabine) that has been approved in the
treatment of haematological malignancies and its effects
on solid tumors were worth considering [25]. Since we
found that DNA methylation was involved in the downregulation of miR-23b, but not of miR-193a, we tested the
effects of 5-aza-dC that restored miR-23b expression, in
combination to miR-193a transfection in HCC cells.

RESULTS
miR-23b and miR-193a are down-regulated in
human primary HCCs
We examined the expression of mature miR-23b and
miR-193a in human HCC specimens and their peritumoral
(PT) counterparts by real-time qPCR. In 59 HCC patients,
the expression of mature miR-23b was significantly lower
in HCC specimens compared with PT tissues from the same
patients (average RQPT = 68.63 ± 7.50, average RQHCC =
36.60 ± 4.08, p<0.001; R [RQHCC/ RQPT]= 0.53; Figure 1A).
Even though the overall expression of miR-23b was lower
in HCC tissue compared to PT tissue, there were patients
showing different trends. In particular, 38 HCC cases
(64%) showed miR-23b down-regulation (R<0.7) while
8 HCC cases (14%) displayed up-regulation of miR-23b
in HCC samples with respect to PT counterparts (R>1.3).
Conversely, 13 patients (22%) showed an equal expression
of miR-23b when HCC and PT tissues were compared
(0.7<R<1.3; Supplementary Figure 1A). Among the 67
HCC patients tested, miR-193a resulted significantly
down-regulated in HCC compared to PT tissues (average
RQPT = 3.13 ± 0.47; average RQHCC = 1.80 ± 0.33; p<0.01;
R [RQHCC/ RQPT] = 0.58; Figure 1B). As for miR-23b,
individual patients showed different trends. We found that
miR-193a was down-regulated in 43 HCC cases (64%)
while it was up-regulated in 14 HCC cases (22%) compared
with corresponding PT tissues. Ten cases (10/67, 15%) had
no change in miRNA expression level between HCC and
PT tissues (Supplementary Figure 1B). To evaluate the
correlation between miR-23b and miR-193a expression
and clinical pathological characteristics, the patients were
divided into 2 groups with high (R>0.8) and low (R<0.8)
miR expression. However, non-significant correlations
were observed between miRs expression and clinical and
pathological characteristics (Supplementary Table 1).
ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed to
prove the diagnostic and prognostic significance of miR23b and miR-193a in HCC. Areas under ROC curve (AUC)
of 0.73 (95% CI = 0.64-0.82; p<0.001) and 0.71 (95% CI =
0.62-0.80; p<0.001) were obtained for miR-23b and miR193a, respectively (Figure 1C). These results suggested that

the expression of miR-23b and miR-193a may discriminate
HCC from PT samples with fair accuracy in the cohort
examined. To conduct the Kaplan-Meier analyses on the
30 cases available, we divided HCC samples into group
with high miR expression (R>0.8) and low miR expression
(R<0.8). No significant difference was reported in the OS
and the disease-free survival (DFS) were found between
cases with higher miR-23b expression compared with lower
expression (Figure 1D). Conversely, the group with higher
miR-193a expression had a significantly increased OS
and DFS than the group with down-regulated miR-193a.
In fact, the higher miR-193a expression group median OS
was of 89 months compared with 39.5 months of the group
with lower miR-193a expression (Log-Rank test p<0.05).
The median DFS for the group of patients with higher miR-

193a expression was of 62 months while the same value
for the group with lower miR-193a expression was of 18
months (Log-Rank test p<0.05; Figure 1E).

DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of
miR-23b expression in primary HCC
In order to understand whether the modulation of
miR-23b and miR-193a in HCC tissues was mediated
by DNA methylation, we compared the level of DNA
methylation and miRs expression in 30 HCC cases more
recently collected. DNA methylation level was detected
by MS-PCR (Supplementary Figure 2) and mature miRs
expression was examined by qPCR. As shown in Figure
2A, miR-23b coding sequence was preceded by two CpG

HCCs displaying miR-23b down-regulation, the methylation level was significantly higher than in PTs; no difference in DNA methylation
was observed in the group of HCCs with equal or up-modulation of the miRNA. G. For miR-193a, DNA methylation level was decreased
in HCC samples in both down-modulated and up-modulated groups. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 in paired t-test analysis.

islands (141bp and 101bp in length, respectively) in a
1.0kb upstream region while miR-193a coding sequence is
embedded in a CpG island (1,477bp in length). The results
obtained in MS-PCR and qPCR showed an inverse trend
between DNA methylation level and miR-23b expression.
In fact, average methylation level was significantly
higher (p<0.01; Figure 2B) and miR-23b expression was
significantly lower (p<0.01; Figure 2C) in HCC tissues
compared with PT tissues. On the contrary, the average
methylation level of miR-193a at CpG sites resulted
significantly reduced in HCC respect PT counterparts
(p<0.001; Figure 2D) with the miRNA generally downregulated in this group of HCC cases (Figure 2E). To
analyze further, we divided the HCC samples into two
groups according to the expression of each miRNA where
R<0.7 indicated miRNA down-modulation and R>0.7
indicated that the miRNA was equal- or up-modulated in
HCC compared to PT tissues. Interestingly, the average
methylation level of miR-23b in the first group was
significantly higher in HCC than PT tissues (p<0.05) while
no difference was observed in the second group (Figure
2F). On the contrary, methylation level of miR-193a was
significantly lower in HCCs, uncoupled with miRNA
expression level (Figure 2G). These findings suggested

that the methylation of CpG sites examined was involved
in the down-regulation of mature miR-23b in primary
HCC, but not in miR-193a down-regulation. However,
the lack of an association between DNA methylation and
miR-23b expression in the HCC group with up-modulated
miRNA hinted at the presence of additional mechanisms
taking part in the regulation of miR-23b in human HCCs
and probably also in miR-193a regulation.

Treatment with 5-aza-dC restored miR-23b
expression in cultured HCC cells
Since the over-expression of miR-23b decreased
proliferation and migration abilities of HCC cells [23],
we evaluated whether treatment with the inhibitor of
DNA methylation 5-aza-dC could induce up-regulation
of miR-23b in HCC-derived cells. Firstly, the expression
levels of miR-23b and miR-193a were examined in
different HCC cell lines. Stem-loop qPCR revealed that
miR-23b was detected at low level in undifferentiated
HCC cells (HA22T/VGH and SKHep1C3) and it was
moderately expressed in differentiated HepG2 cells
(Figure 3A). On the contrary, miR-193a expression level
was moderate in HA22T/VGH and SKHep1C3 and very

expression levels, respectively, were detected by stem-loop qPCR in human HCC cells. Histograms represent the mean RQ while bars

Effects of miR-193a ectopic expression and
5-aza-dC treatment on expression of MET and

low in HepG2 cells (Figure 3B). Regarding the level of
DNA methylation, miR-23b CpG sites resulted partially
methylated in HCC cells as detected by MS-PCR. In
particular, the band specific for methylated sequence
was predominant with a percentage of methylation equal
or greater than 60% in all HCC cell lines (Figure 3C).
Furthermore, miR-193a CpG sites resulted completely
unmethylated in HA22T/VGH and SKHep1C3 cells and
68% methylated in HepG2 cells (Figure 3D). Treatment
with 5-aza-dC reduced the methylation level of miR-23b
CpG sites in all cell lines but particularly in HA22T/
VGH and HepG2 cells. However, the reduction of
methylation in HA22T/VGH and HepG2 cells did not
lead to a significant difference in miR-23b expression
(Figure 3E). Interestingly, SKHep1C3 cells showed only
a modest reduction in methylation but were evidently
more sensitive to demethylation since mature miR23b expression significantly increased (p<0.05) in cells
after treatment with the inhibitor of DNA methylation
compared with untreated cells (Figure 3E). Similarly,
5-aza-dC treatment in HepG2 cells led to the decrease in
methylation level of miR-193a CpG sites (Figure 3D) and
39% increase in mature miR-193a expression (p<0.05;
Figure 3F). All together, these results showed that the
methylation of DNA contributed to the regulation of miR23b in SKHep1C3 cells and miR-193a in HepG2 cells.

Since 5-aza-dC treatment induced the expression
of miR-23b in SKHep1C3 cells, we hypothesized that
by combining the inhibitor of DNA methylation with
miR-193a transfection it could be possible to re-establish
the homeostatic level activities of miR-23b and miR193a. In our previous published studies [22, 23] we have
demonstrated that miR-23b and miR-193a negatively
regulated the expression of uPA and MET in HCC cells.
For this reason we examined whether the combined use
of 5-aza-dC and miR-193a transfection might alter the
expression of MET and uPA. For this purpose, MET and
uPA protein expression was evaluated by western blot
in SKHep1C3 cells treated with 10 μM 5-aza-dC alone
or in combination with 100 nM miR-193a. The receptor
tyrosine kinase MET is synthesized as a precursor protein
of 170 kDa that is cleaved to yield a 50-kDa α-chain and a
145-kDa β-chain linked together by disulfide bonds. After
5 days, there was a 2.2 fold decrease in the MET β-chain
expression level (equivalent to 55%) in cells treated with
10 μM 5-aza-dC as compared with the control exposed to
DMSO only (p<0.05; Figure 4A). The reduced expression
of MET protein was also observed in cells treated with

Figure 4: Effects of combined treatment with 5-aza-dC and miR-193a on MET and uPA protein expression levels.

SKHep1C3 cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle) and 10 μM 5-aza-dC for 5 days (lanes 1 and 2) or treated with 10 μM 5-aza-dC in

activity C. on conditioned medium. The histograms represent the mean IOD (Integrated Optical Density) values in percentage while bars

10 μM 5-aza-dC and transfected with 100 nM miR193a where 32% and 20% decrease at 24h and 48h after
transfection, respectively, was observed when compared
to cells treated with DMSO and lipofectamine alone.
In contrast, uPA protein level was up-regulated by 23%
after 5-aza-dC treatment and by 50% after co-treatment
with 5-aza-dC and miR-193a at 48h from transfection, as
compared with corresponding controls (Figure 4B). The
corresponding enzymatic activity evaluated in zymography
confirmed the trend of uPA protein expression (Figure
4C). To support the above mentioned results, we treated
2 more HCC cell lines (HepG2 and HA22T/VGH) with
the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-dC and miR-193a to
verify whether uPA and MET expression may be affected.
In HepG2 and HA22T/VGH cells the MET expression
level decreased in 5-aza-dC treated cells and in the cotreated cells, in line with the results found in SKHep1C3
(Supplementary Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure
3C). uPA protein expression did not change in HepG2
following combined treatments (Supplementary Figure
3B) and its enzymatic activity was undetectable (data
not shown); in HA22T/VGH cells uPA protein and its
enzymatic activity resulted inhibited following 5-aza-dC
and miR-193a combined treatment (Supplementary Figure
3D and Supplementary Figure 3E).

treatment with 5-aza-dC alone decreased cell migration
by 23% as compared with untreated cells (Figure 5B).
The combination of miR-193a transfection and 5-aza-dC
treatment further significantly reduced cell migration up to
56% (p<0.001) at 100nM miR dose concentration.
Subsequently, we verified whether a combined
approach based on the co-administration of a low dose
sorafenib (5 μM) in combination with 5-aza-dC or 5-azadC plus miR-193a could show a major inhibitor effect
on HCC cell proliferation. As shown in Figure 5C, at T1
(48h) sorafenib alone displayed the highest inhibition
of cell proliferation (37% decrease against DMSO
alone, p<0.001) compared to miR-193a transfection and
5-aza-dC treatment. The combinations of 5-aza-dC plus
sorafenib and sorafenib plus miR-193a significantly
reduced cell proliferation ability compared to relative
controls (39% and 46% decrease against DMSO and
miR-NC + DMSO respectively; p<0.001). The same
effect was observed after the co-administration of the 3
treatments (42% reduction, p<0.001) as compared with
untreated cells (miR-NC + DMSO). After 72 hours (T2)
from miR-193a transfection, only sorafenib maintained its
inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, even if to a lower
level (20% compared to DMSO). These findings suggested
that the combination of 5-aza-dC treatment and miR-193a
ectopic expression induced a considerable inhibition of
proliferation and migration in HCC cells; furthermore the
addition of sorafenib to 5-aza-dC, in presence or not of
miR-193a, did not increase the inhibitory effects on cell
viability carried out by the treatment with sorafenib alone.

5-aza-dC treatment and miR-193a ectopic
expression decreased the proliferation and
migration of HCC cells
To determine the biological effects of 5-azadC treatment in combination with miR-193a ectopic
expression, we pre-treated SKHep1C3 cells with 10 μM
5-aza-dC followed by transfection with synthetic premiR-193a at 50 and 100 nM doses and monitoring of cell
growth, as described in the Materials and Methods section.
The MTT assay data showed no significant difference
of cell viability after miR-193a transfection, while the
treatment with 5-aza-dC alone decreased cell growth by
up to 18% at 48h after the last treatment as compared with
untreated cells (Figure 5A). The combination of miR-193a
transfection and 5-aza-dC treatment further significantly
reduced cell proliferation. Particularly when 100 nM of
miR-193a was used, the cell growth decreased up 32%
(p<0.001) at 48h after transfection as compared with
control cells (DMSO treated and miR-NC transfected).
The inhibition of cell growth was not observed at 72h
suggesting that 5-aza-dC treatment and miR transfection
had a transient effect on proliferation. In these conditions,
the expression levels of mature miR-23b was increased
up to 72% following 5-aza-dC treatment and miR-193a
transfection (Supplementary Figure 4A); miR-193a was
upregulated up to 168 folds (Supplementary Figure 4B)
after ectopic miR-193a transfection as verified by qPCR.
Further, we evaluated the effects of 5-aza-dC and miR193a transfection on SKHep1C3 cell migration. The

Effects of miR-23b and miR-193a ectopic
expression on the proliferation and migration of
HCC cells
Since 5-aza-dC determines global changes in gene
expression, we tested whether co-transfection of low doses
miR-23b and miR-193a in SKHep1C3 cells may impair
the cell proliferation and migration in order to compare
the effects provoked by 5-aza-dC and miR-193a treatment.
The combined transfection did not induce additive cell
proliferation inhibition (Figure 6A). The major effect was
observed 24 h after 50 nM miR-23b transfection (20%,
p<0.05). The migration ability of SKHep1C3 was inhibited
after miR-23b and miR-193a single transfection and an
additive trend was found following the co-transfection
with miRs (Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION
In previously published studies, we have
demonstrated that miR-23b directly targeted both MET
and uPA in HCC cells and that the ectopic expression of
miR-23b reduced proliferation and migration abilities of
HCC cells [23]. More recently, we found that miR-193a
negatively regulated uPA and the transfection of HCC

the results reported by Liu et al. that examined miR-193a
expression in 95 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
HCC tissues and corresponding PT [26].
In the recent years, epigenetic alterations have been
highlighted as key factors during cancer development
and progression; among which, aberrant methylation of
CpG dinucleotides has been the best studied epigenetic
modification in cancer, including HCC. Changes in
DNA methylation level emerge at the early stage of
hepatocarcinogenesis, affecting both coding and noncoding genes, such as genes encoding miRNAs [27, 28].

cells with miR-193a decreased cell growth, increased
apoptosis and sensitized the HCC cells to sorafenib [22].
In the present study carried out using a large cohort of
patients with HCC, we found that miR-23b and miR-193a
were significantly down-regulated in HCC specimens
compared with peritumoral (PT) counterparts and the
expression of both miRs could be used as a marker of
diagnosis at molecular level. Moreover, the low expression
of miR-193a resulted significantly related to reduced
overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) of
patients. The latter finding confirmed and complemented

A number of miRNAs are found epigenetically silenced
by DNA hypermethylation and their dysregulation usually
resulted in the alteration of important pathways involved
in carcinogenesis. Here, for the first time, we have found
that DNA hyper-methylation was involved in the miR-23b
down-modulation in HCC because we reported an inverse
trend between DNA methylation and miR-23b expression
in primary HCC. In line with this finding, miR-23b was
found to be silenced by hypermethylation in prostate
cancer tissues and cell lines [29], in glioma stem cells [30]
and cervical cancer cell lines [31]. On the contrary, in the
same HCC cases analysed the miR-193a down-modulation
was not associated to a hyper-methylation of the miR193a-related CpG island. Previous studies concerning
miR-193a showed that it is regulated by DNA methylation
in oral cancer and in non-small cell lung cancer [32,
33] and acute myeloid leukemia [34]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that other mechanisms could take part in
miR-193a regulation in HCC. Among these, Max and
RXRα were reported as two transcription factors that bind
directly miR-193a regulatory region and inhibit miR-193a
expression in ER-Src transformed cells [35]. Furthermore,
like protein-coding genes, miRNAs expression can be
closely associated to histone modifications. Data obtained
using miRNA microarray analysis showed that HDAC
inhibitors modulated the expression of several miRNAs
also in HCC cell lines [36, 37].
The next aim of the present work was the
identification of an HCC in vitro model to modulate
miR-23b and miR-193a expression. The analyses of
DNA methylation level reported that miR-23b was
methylated in all 3 HCC cell lines examined at low miR23b expression level and miR-193a was methylated
in differentiated HepG2 cells. On the contrary, in
undifferentiated HCC cell lines, miR-193a resulted
completely unmethylated. Previously, Ma et al. indicated
that the 5-Fluorouracil-sensitivity of HCC cells, including
HepG2, was related to the down-regulation of miR-193a
mediated by DNA hypermethylation. They also showed
the total demethylation of miR-193a in different HCC
cell lines [38], in agreement with our results. In addition,
in malignant pleural mesothelioma cells that displayed
downregulation of miR-193a, this miR was detected
unmethylated [39]. About the demethylating effects, we
showed that miR-23b levels increased after treatment with
the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-dC in SKHep1C3
and in HepG2 cells. This increased sensitivity to inhibitor
of DNA methylation coupled with the observation that
DNA methylation levels of miR-23b and miR-193a were
in line with those observed in HCC specimens supported
our decision to use the SKHep1C3 cells to modulate miR23b and miR-193a expression.
In recent years, the advances in the knowledge of
epigenetics, suggested the use of epigenetic drugs for the
treatment of solid tumors to obtain the demethylation
of tumor suppressor genes and miRs at epigenomic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

level. Inhibitor of DNA methylations such as 5-Aza-2’deoxycytidine and 5-Azacytidine have been approved
for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and
their effects on apoptosis and senescence have been
established in HCC cells [40, 41]. In order to define a
design of a responsive experimental treatment approach
based on the modulation of miR-23b and miR-193a, we
attempted to restore miR-23b and miR-193a respectively
by 5-aza-dC treatment and ectopic miR-193a expression
in SKHep1C3 cells and we assessed the expression
levels of the miR-23b and miR-193a targets, uPA and
MET. Data obtained in western blot analysis conducted
in SKHep1C3 cells and in 2 more cell lines (HepG2 and
HA22T/VGH) were consistent with the hypothesis that
global DNA demethylation downregulates MET through
the activation of intracellular mechanisms, including
increase of endogenous miR-23b. For example, it has
been shown that DNA demethylation activates a fusion
transcript LINE-1-MET that reduces the expression of
MET in colon carcinoma cells [42]. Conversely, 5-azadC treatment with or without miR-193a transfection
increased uPA protein levels in SKHep1C3 cells thus
indicating that the ectopic expression of miR193a and the
miR-23b upregulation induced by 5-aza-dC treatment had
minor effects on uPA expression. However, in HA22T/
VGH cells uPA protein and its enzymatic activity resulted
unchanged in 5-aza-dC treated cells and inhibited in cotreated cells suggesting a major role of miR-193a toward
its target uPA in these cells. In HepG2 cells at very low
levels of uPA protein expression, the effects of 5-azadC with or without miR-193a were almost undetectable.
Further investigations will examine whether this uPA
overexpression may be due to DNA demethylation of
its promoter or to other mechanisms in these 3 different
HCC cells. Concerning the aggressive properties, our
data indicated that the miR-193a ectopic expression
and the 5-aza-dC treatment applied independently had
a very low effect on inhibition of cell growth. Instead,
in combination 5-aza-dC and miR-193a significantly
decreased cell proliferation and migration abilities.
These findings suggested that the ectopic expression of
miR-193a may sensitize HCC cells to 5-aza-dC probably
by acting on pathways not directly linked since they
individually had a marginal effect. The combination of
5-aza-dC plus the oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib,
with or without miR-193a, did not show additional
effects respect the use of low-dose sorafenib alone which
had a more stable growth inhibitory effect in HCC cells.
However, a recent phase I/II study confirmed the efficacy
and safety of lower-dose 5-aza-dC based treatment that
improved PFS (progression-free survival) and OS of 4
and 11 months respectively in patients with advanced
HCC [43]. Therefore, it could be deduced that 5-aza-dC
can be an option for the treatment of HCC, especially
in patients not responsive to sorafenib or in patients
developing resistance.

In summary, our results have shown that the miR23b and miR193a down-modulation could significantly
contribute to the molecular characterization of HCC
diagnosis and that miR-193a may be a molecular
prognostic factor for HCC patients; that DNA methylation
mediates the miR-23b, and not miR-193a expression in
human primary HCC. For biological activities of these
miRs, only ectopic expression of miR-23b led to a
significant proliferation inhibition of HCC cells and both
miRs ectopic expression generated a strong inhibiting
effect on migration abilities of HCC cells. Further, our
finding of the increase of miR-23b expression in cultured
HCC cells following 5-aza-dC treatment raises a novel
issue to be elucidated on markers of treatment efficacy.

h. DMSO was added to cultures at 0.01% (v/v) as a solvent
control. Sorafenib [N-(3-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorophenyl)N-(4-(2-methylcarbamoylpyridin-4-yl) oxyphenyl) urea]
was synthesized at Bayer Corporation (West Haven, CT).
This compound was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with
MEM to have a final concentration of 5 μM.

Real-time quantification of mature miRNAs by
stem–loop RT-PCR
The total RNAs were isolated from tissue samples
and cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Mature miR-193a and
miR-23b were quantitated by a two-step Taq-Man realtime PCR analysis, using primers and probes obtained
from Applied Biosystems (Foster, CA, USA). cDNA was
synthesized from total RNA (50 ng) in 15 μl reactions,
using reverse transcriptase and the stem–loop primer for
miR-193a (Applied Biosystems; PN 4427975), miR-23b
(Applied Biosystems; PN 4373073) or RNU66 (internal
control; Applied Biosystems; PN 4373382) contained in
the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA). The reverse transcription
reaction was performed by incubating the samples at
16°C for 30 min, followed by incubation at 42°C for 30
min and 85°C for 5 min. The q-RT PCR reaction (20 μl)
contained 1.3 μl of reverse transcription product, 10 μl of
Taq-Man 2× Universal PCR Master Mix and 1 μl of the
appropriate TaqMan MicroRNA Assay (20×) specific for
the miRNA targeted by the assay. The PCR mixtures were
incubated at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at
95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s. PCRs were performed in
triplicate using the 7500 real time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems). The expression of miR-193a and miR-23b
was based on the ∆∆CT method, using RNU66 as an
internal control. For each case the ratio (R= RQHCC/RQPT)
between the relative levels in HCC and those in PT was
assessed. The level of miRNAs expression was considered
to be decreased for R values below 0.7 and increased for R
values above1.3. When values were between 0.7 and 1.3,
the miRNA expression was considered unchanged.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples of HCC
All human HCC samples and their corresponding
PT non-tumour samples (resected 1–2 cm from the
malignant tumour) were obtained from HCC patients
undergoing surgical resection. Each biopsy specimen
was obtained with the informed consent of patient
under standard conditions of sampling and processing,
as previously described and the procedures followed
were in accordance with standards of ethics committee
(NP1230) [23]. None of the patients had previously
received therapeutic treatment. A total of 59 and 67 HCC
patients were considered for miR-23b and miR-193a
expression analyses, respectively, including the subsets
of HCC patients evaluated beforehand: 17 for miR-23b
[23] and 39 cases for miR-193a [22]. Each specimen was
determined to be HCC or PT by pathological examination.
The characteristics of the patients are described in
Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3.

Cell cultures and treatments
The following human HCC cell lines were used in
this study: HA22T/VGH (undifferentiated HCC-derived
cells provided by Prof. N. D’Alessandro, University of
Palermo, Italy), HepG2 (differentiated HCC-derived
cells; ATTC HB-8065) and SKHep1Clone3 (SKHep1C3),
selected from human HCC-derived cells (SKHep1: ATCC
HTB-52). HA22T/VGH cells were maintained in RPMI1640 (Life Technologies) while HepG2 and SKHep1C3
were maintained in Earle’s MEM. Both media were
supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and cells
were grown at 37°C with 5% CO2. 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine
(5-aza-dC; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at the concentration of 50 mg/ml.
To study DNA methylation levels, HCC cell lines were
treated with 10 μM 5-aza-dC for 10 days (HA22T/VGH
and HepG2) or for 5 days (SKHep1C3). Culture medium
containing freshly added 5-aza-dC was replaced every 48

DNA isolation and bisulfite modification
Genomic DNA was extracted from HCC cell
lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2 and SKHep1C3 treated
or not with 5-aza-dC) and tissue samples (HCC and the
corresponding PT), using the Wizard Genomic DNA
Purification Kit (Promega) and the Blood Core Kit B
(Qiagen), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To verify the integrity of genomic DNA,
100 ng of each sample was loaded on ethidium bromidestained 0.8% agarose (w/v) gel and visualized as a high
molecular weight single band. Bisulfite treatments of
DNA were performed with EZ DNA Methylation Kit
(Zymo Research), which allow purification and recovery

alone, according to experimental conditions).

Cell proliferation assay

Methylation analysis of CpG sites associated
with miR-193a and miR-23b by methylationspecific PCR (MSP)

The cellular proliferation was analysed using the
CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution reagent (Promega,
San Diego, CA, USA) after the pre-miR-193a/23b, premiR precursor negative control #1 (Life Technologies)
transfections and 5-aza-dC/sorafenib treatments. The
cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 replicates for each
experimental condition) at a density of 4 × 103 cells/
well in a complete cultured medium and 15 μl/well of
sterile CellTiter reagent was added at the established time
after transfection and/or 5-aza-dC/sorafenib treatments.
The plates were measured 2 h after CellTiter addition
using a microplate reader (EnSight, Perkin Elmer). The
absorbance values at 490 nm were directly proportional to
the number of living cells in the culture.

Methprimer (http://www.urogene.org/methprimer)
was used to verify the presence of CpG islands in the
1.0 kb upstream sequences of miR-193a and miR-23b.
To investigate the methylation of miRs CpG sites,
methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was performed.
Bisulfite-converted DNA was amplified using primer
sets specific for the methylated sequence (primers
M) and the unmethylated sequence (primers U). The
methylation-specific
and
unmethylation-specific
primers were designed by MethPrimer (http://www.
urogene.org/methprimer/; Supplementary Table 4).
Hot start-PCR was performed in the following way: a
cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by
40 (miR-193a) or 37 (miR-23b) cycles at 94°C for 30
s, 57°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension
at 72°C for 3 min. MS-PCR products were visualized
on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose (w/v) gel. The
bands corresponding to methylated and unmethylated
DNA were analyzed using a digital system (Gel-Pro
Analyzer) and the integrated optical density (IOD) values
were expressed in pixel. The percentage of methylation
level in each sample was obtained using the following
formula: IOD band Methylated/(IOD band M + IOD
band Unmethylated) × 100.

In vitro scratch assay
120,000 SKHep1C3 cells were seeded in 24-well
plate in complete medium, they were grown to 80%
confluency and then transfected with 50 nM and 100
nM pre-miR-23b/pre-miR-193a or/and treated with 10
μM 5-aza-dC. After 24 h the transfection medium was
replaced with fresh medium. When the cells reached
the 100% confluence a scratch was made through the
cell layer using a sterile micropipette tip. After washes
with PBS, serum-free medium was added. The images
of the wounded area were captured immediately after
the scratch (T0) and 20 and 30 h later (T1 and T2) to
monitor the cell migration into the wounded area. The
migration abilities were quantified by measuring the
area of the scratched regions using the ImageJ software.
The experiment was performed twice.

Transient transfection of miR-23b and miR-193a
and 5-aza-dC/sorafenib treatments of HCC cells
Molecules of dsRNAs that mimic endogenousmiR-23b (5’-AUCACAUUGCCAGGGAUUACC-3’),
miR-193a (5’-AACUGGCCUACAAAGUCCCAGU-3’)
and pre-miRNA precursor negative control #1 (Life
Technologies) were transfected into SKHep1C3
cells using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Life
Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. To evaluate the effect on cell proliferation
of miR-193a/miR-23b transfection in combination
with 5-aza-dC treatment (or 5-aza-dC and sorafenib
treatment), SKHep1C3 cells were pre-treated with 10
μM 5-aza-dC for 48 h and then trypsinized and seeded
in 96-well plates (5 replicates for each experimental
condition) at a density of 4 x 103 cells/well in complete
culture medium supplemented with 10 μM 5-azadC. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the cells were
transfected with 50 and 100 nM pre-miR-193a into
serum-free MEM containing 10 μM 5-aza-dC. After 5 h,
the transfection medium was replaced with the complete
medium supplemented with 5-aza-dC (or 10 μM 5-azawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blot and zymography
The cellular extracts and media were collected
from 24 h and 48 h cultures of SKHep1C3, HA22T/
VGH and HepG2 cells under the following experimental
conditions: cells treated with 10 μM 5-aza-dC for 5
days, cells treated with 10 μM 5-aza-dC and transfected
with 100 nM miR-193a and control cells (DMSO and
DMSO + Lipofectamine, respectively). To evaluate
the levels of MET and GAPDH expression, cells were
lysed in 0.05% SDS and constant amounts of protein
were loaded on 4-12% Novex NuPAGE Bis/Tris gels
(Invitrogen) under reducing conditions. To detect uPA
expression, proteins contained in the conditioned media
were separated using 8% SDS polyacrylamide gels
under non-reducing conditions and electro-transferred
on nitrocellulose membranes (NM). The following
primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-human MET
(1:1000 in 0.3% BSA; Santa Cruz Biotecnology), mouse

using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit or antimouse IgG (1:7500 in 0.3% BSA; Promega). The results
of the immunoreaction were detected with Western Blue
Stabilized Substrate for Alkaline Phosphatase (Promega).
Protein bands were visualized and analyzed using the GelPro Analyzer software and the integrated optical density
(IOD) values were expressed in pixels. uPA activity was
evaluated in zymography in which NMs were overlaid
onto casein agar containing 2 μg/ml human plasminogen

differences of miRNAs expression and DNA methylation
between HCC and PT samples and between 5-aza-dC
treated cells and their control, and for uPA and MET
expression. Receiver-operating curves (ROC) were
conducted to determine ability of miR-23b and miR193a to discriminate between tumor and PT tissues. For
survival curves, Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted
using 30 cases. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by post-hoc Tukey test was applied to discern significant
differences in the proliferation assays. Correlation
between miR-23b/193a expression levels and clinical
and pathological characteristics was evaluated using Chisquare test. Data were considered significant when P-value
≤ 0.05.
