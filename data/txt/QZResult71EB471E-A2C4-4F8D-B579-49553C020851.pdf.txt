ABSTRACT
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by a constitutive activation
of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. Bcr-Abl/T315I is the predominant mutation that causes
resistance to Imatinib. In the present study, we synthesized a novel Bcr-Abl inhibitor,
HS-543, and investigated its effect on cell survival or apoptosis in CML cells bearing
Bcr-Abl/T315I (BaF3/T315I) or wild-type Bcr-Abl (BaF3/WT). HS-543 showed
anti-proliferative effects in the BaF3/WT cells as well as the BaF3/T315I cells with
resistance to Imatinib and strongly inhibited the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in a
dose‑dependent manner. Furthermore, it significantly increased the sub G1 phase
associated with early apoptosis, with increased levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved
caspase-3, as well as the TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. In addition, we found that
HS-543 induced apoptosis with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by
decreasing the expression of Mcl-1 and survivin, together with increasing that of Bax.
In BaF3/T315I xenograft models, HS-543 significantly delayed tumor growth, unlike
Imatinib. Our results demonstrate that HS-543 exhibits the induction of apoptosis
and anti-proliferative effect by blocking the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in the T315Imutated Bcr-Abl cells with resistance to Imatinib. We suggest that HS-543 may be
a novel promising agent to target Bcr-Abl and overcome Imatinib resistance in CML
patients.

INTRODUCTION

Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which results from
the reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(9;22) and
is represented as Bcr–Abl fusion gene. This Bcr–Abl
fusion protein is found in ~95% of patients with CML
and 20~30% of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) [1], a lesser extent Bcr-Abl+ ALL [2]. The
Bcr–Abl aberrant tyrosine kinase is mainly responsible
for malignant transformation by activating multiple
signal transduction pathways including Stats, MAPK/
Erk, and PI3K/Akt, which ultimately lead to increased

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal
myeloproliferative disorder that is characterized by high
levels of immature white blood cells, which is one of the
most understood neoplasms. Annually, newly diagnosed
cases of CML in the United States is estimated to be about
4,800 to 5,200. The estimated prevalence of CML cases
in the United States was approximately 25,000~30,000.
CML is defined by the formation and presence of the

survival, proliferation, and escape from apoptosis [3,
4]. For this reason, Bcr–Abl tyrosine kinase has been
considered as an important target for CML therapeutics.
Meanwhile, Imatinib is considered as the first selective
Bcr–Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for cancer
therapy, which interrupts Bcr–Abl oncogenic signaling.
Therefore, Imatinib has become the new “gold standard”
for the treatment of patients with CML. Especially, 80%
of newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase CML has
shown a complete cytogenetic response to treatment with
Imatinib over a median follow-up of 54 months. Although
the initial response rates are high, Imatinib fails in up to
40% of patients because of disease resistance or Bcr-Abl
kinase domain mutations, and unacceptable side effects.
To circumvent the resistance, more potent TKIs such as
Nilotinib and Dasatinib as the second generation TKIs,
have been approved. However, these compounds do not
show therapeutic activities against all Imatinib-resistant
mutants of Bcr-Abl, and finally a long-term tolerablility
problem has emerged.
Drug resistance during the Imatinib treatment is
mostly related to point mutations occurring within the
kinase domain of Bcr-Abl. To date, over 90 different point
mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain have been isolated
from relapsed CML patients, who are resistant to Imatinib.
Among those, the T315I is the most stubborn point
mutation having an impact on the binding of Imatinib with
Bcr-Abl kinase domain. Also, the T315I is responsible
for approximately 15% of the cases of relapse in CML
and Bcr-Abl+ ALL patients on Imatinib therapy [5], and
there is high occurrence of E255K and M351T mutations
[6, 7]. Most mutations, except T315I, may be eradicated
with the appropriate choice and combinations of second
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, there is
still no effective TKI available for CML with the T315I
mutation. Considering these facts, the T315I mutation
remains a crucial clinical challenge, and it is imperative
to develop novel strategies to overcome this resistance.
To resolve these problems, we synthesized
and screened a chemical library of novel series of
benzothiazole-based inhibitors that are effective against
wild-type and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl kinases [8]. Of the
benzothiazole-based inhibitors, 1-(6-(2- methoxyphenyl)
benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl),
HS-543 was identified as the potent Bcr-Abl kinases
inhibitor. Here, we investigated whether or not HS-543
possesses anti-cancer activity in BaF3/T315I or BaF3/WT
and the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.
In this study, our results showed that HS-543 suppressed
the Bcr-Abl pathway and induced apoptosis in not only
BaF3/WT cells but also T315I-mutated Bcr-Abl cells with
resistance to Imatinib.

Synthesis of HS-543 and its binding mode to BcrAbl
We identified a novel Bcr-Abl inhibitor,
1-(6-(2-methoxyphenyl)benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(2-(4methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl) urea or HS-543. As shown
in Table 1, HS-543 was further subjected to kinase
selectivity profiling against a panel of cancer-related
kinases at 1 μM concentrations in a high-throughput
binding assay (KINOMEscan®, Ambit Biosciences, San
Diego, CA). Percent of control (POC) determinations were
also performed. HS-543 displayed only a high degree of
selectivity to Abl but not to other kinases such as Aurora
and c-Kit, which are known to have high structural
similarities to Abl. The only kinases against which HS543 demonstrated target activity were Abl (POC 1.6) and
Abl/T315I (POC 3.1). We prepared the receptor model in
DFG-in conformation from the X-ray crystal structure of
T315I mutant in a complex with PPY-A (PDB code: 2Z60)
[9]. Fig. 1 shows the possible binding mode of HS-543
in the ATP binding site of T315I mutant Abl, which was
obtained through a docking simulation using the Autodock

methoxyphenyl moiety was surrounded by a hydrophobic
pocket, and methyl piperazine moiety in C2 urea was
expected to the solvent front. In the hinge region, the
nitrogen of benzothiazole scaffold and the C2 urea group
appeared to form a tight hydrogen bond with the backbone
residue of Met318 in the hinge region. Especially, both of
the two NHs in the distorted C2 urea group appeared to
act as hydrogen bond donors and form hydrogen bonds
with aminocarbonyl oxygen of the Met318 backbone.
C6 aryl moiety was directed toward the region nearby
the gatekeeper and catalytic lysine. The C6 phenyl ring
seemed to form favorable van der Waals interactions with
the larger mutated gatekeeper, Ile318, without causing
steric hindrance. In addition, the oxygen of the 2’-methoxy

HS-543 inhibits the proliferation of leukemia cells
MTS assays were performed to evaluate the effect of
HS-543 on the growth of BaF3/WT and BaF3/T315I cells.
The cells were treated with various concentrations of HS543 and Imatinib for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, both HS543 and Imatinib treatments reduced the cell viability of
the BaF3/WT cells; IC50 values were 0.33 μM for Imatinib
and 0.116 μM for HS-543. As shown in Fig. 2B, HS-543
significantly reduced the cell viability of BaF3/T315I
cells (IC50 = 0.33 µM), while Imatinib showed little effect
(IC50 = 10 μM). These data suggest that HS-543 exhibits
the potent inhibitory activity in T315I mutated Bcr-Abl

the induction of apoptosis, we performed several cellbased apoptosis assays. We first assessed the cell cycle
distribution by a flow cytometric analysis. The cells were
collected, stained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry
after they were incubated with HS-543 for various doses
and times. As shown in the Fig. 4A, HS-543 increased
the number of cells in the sub G1 phase, associated with
early apoptosis without changes of the cell cycle arrest. To
characterize nuclear morphology, the nuclei were stained
with Hoechst, and a TUNEL assay was performed. As a
result, the cells treated with HS-543 were presented with
more prominent morphological features of apoptotic cells,
such as bright nuclear condensation by Hoechst staining
(Fig. 4B). HS-543-induced apoptosis was confirmed by
detecting DNA fragmentation using TUNEL staining.
Cells were treated with HS-543 for 24 h (Fig. 4C, **p
<0.001). Furthermore, HS-543 significantly increased
the expression of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3,
apoptosis-related molecules in BaF3/T315I cells (Fig. 4D),
compared with Imatinib. An increase of cleaved caspase-3
was also confirmed by immunofluorescence after treating
with 1 μM HS-543 in BaF3/T315I cells for 24 h (Fig. 4E).

HS-543 inhibits Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in
BaF3/T315I cells
To test if the antiproliferative effects of HS-543
were dependent on the inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity,
phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and its respective downstream
signals, Crkl and Stat5, were measured by western
blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, HS-543 strongly
inhibited the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl (Tyr177) in BaF3/
T315I cells. Likewise, the phosphorylation levels of Crkl
(Tyr207) and Stat5 (Tyr694) were effectively suppressed in
a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, Imatinib
did not alter the phosphorylation levels of Bcr-Abl,
Crkl and Stat5 in BaF3/T315I cells. These results were
confirmed by a confocal fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 3C).

by HS-543 in BaF3/T315I cells [9]. As shown in Fig.

cytochrome c release by immunostaining and western

also remarkably lower in the HS-543 treated group than

in all groups. To further confirm whether HS-543 inhibits
tumor growth through the induction of apoptosis and
inhibition of proliferation, we identified the expression

the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and decreased for

revolutionary treatment of CML, due particularly to
the durable remission most chronic-phase patients
experience. Also, Imatinib inhibits Bcr–Abl kinase with
50% inhibitory concentration values of 0.1–0.5 µM in
cell-based assays [14, 15]. Targeted therapy to inhibit
the oncogene Bcr-Abl seems to be somewhat successful.
However, Imatinib resistance often occurs in patients
especially in CML accelerated phase and blast crisis,
and almost unrelievedly occurs in patients with the BcrAbl expression, showing shortcomings of the therapy.
According to Imatinib resistance, amplification and
mutation of Bcr-Abl is believed to be the predominant.
To overcome this acquired resistance to Imatinib, a lot
of researchers have developed a new, second-generation
ATP-competitive Abl kinase inhibitors, such as AMN107,
Dasatinib, INNO-406 and PD166326, which have stronger
affinities for the ATP-binding site of Bcr-Abl kinase
than Imatinib, and has shown partial effect for Imatinibresistant patients [16-20]. Although these novel inhibitors
can effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of the mutated
Bcr-Abl (E255K and M351T), they showed little effect
on Bcr-Abl/T315I [21]. Therefore, innovative treatment
is necessary to over-ride TKI-resistant mutations, or
to promote elimination of Bcr-Abl harboring cells in
patients. The principal objective of this study is to identify

DISCUSSION
In 95% of CML cases, the product of a reciprocal
translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, the
Philadelphia chromosome, is detected, which is
characterized by the presence of Bcr–Abl fusion gene,
representing a subtype of leukemia with poor prognosis,
rapidly acquiring resistance to the Imatinib treatment
during therapy [12, 13]. Imatinib is the molecular targeted
agent that selectively inhibits the Bcr–Abl tyrosine kinase
activity. To date, Imatinib has been recognized as a

the effective targeted chemotherapy against CML cells
carrying T315I-mutant Bcr-Abl that confers resistance to
Imatinib. In this study, we demonstrated that HS-543, a
novel Bcr-Abl TKI, had high affinity for the ATP-binding
site, resulting in high specificity to BaF3/T315I (Table 1).
In light of these results, we investigated whether HS-543
had potent activity on Bcr-Abl target inhibition in BaF3/
WT and BaF3/T315I CML cell lines. HS-543 potently
inhibited the proliferation in both BaF3/WT (IC50 = 0.116
µM) and BaF3/T315I (IC50 = 0.33 µM) cells. However,
Imatinib did not inhibit the proliferation in BaF3/T315I
cells, since IC50 values were more than 10 μM.
Bcr-Abl activates multiple downstream signaling
pathways, including Stat5 pathway, which contribute to
leukemic cell proliferation and survival [22, 23]. Also,
the Stat5 activation is mediated by the adaptor protein
Crkl [24, 25]. In addition, Stat5 activity appears to play
a major role in the antiapoptotic and proliferative abilities
of Bcr-Abl transformed cells [22, 23]. Previous studies
have established phosphorylation of Stat5 as an indicator
of Bcr-Abl activity [26]. Therefore, we identified whether
HS-543 could inhibit Bcr-Abl signaling pathway. As
expected, HS-543 distinctly inhibited the phosphorylation
of Bcr-Abl, which indicates decreased Abl kinase activity,
as well as a pronounced inhibition of Bcr-Abl downstream
target Stat5 phosphorylation in BaF3/T315I cells.
Also, phosphorylation of another well-known Bcr-Abl
downstream target Crkl was obviously reduced after the
treatment with HS-543. Interestingly, Imatinib inhibited
the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl pathways, such as BcrAbl, Stat5, and Crkl in BaF3/WT cells, but not in BaF3/
T315I cells. These results revealed that the decrease of
phosphorylation of Crkl and Stat5 by HS-543 in the cells
with the highly resistant mutation T315I was significant,
which indicate an effective inhibition of Bcr-Abl carrying
this highly resistant mutation.
Also, HS-543 induces mitochondrial apoptosis in
BaF3/T3151 cells. In fact, apoptosis has been noticed
to be associated with a loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential, which may correspond to the opening of an outer
membrane pore, leading to the release of cytochrome c
into the cytoplasm [27]. Also, the release of cytochrome c
induces the expression of various pro-apoptotic proteins in
cytoplasm [28]. Especially, Bax initiates a mitochondrial
permeability shift and induces apoptosis by moving from
the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane [29]. And,
Mcl-1 and survivin as anti-apoptotic proteins have been
reported to bind to caspases to inhibit apoptosis signaling
[30]. More importantly, Bcr-Abl inhibits apoptosis through
regulating Bcl-2 family members [31], increasing the
expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such
as Bax and Bcl-2 through activation of the transcription
factor Stat5 [32-34]. Additionally, Bcr-Abl has been
shown to prevent mitochondrial cytochrome c release
through a posttranslational mechanism [35]. Accordingly,
we assumed that HS-543 would affect the mitochodrial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

membrane potential and induce apoptosis since HS-543
showed a high specific inhibition against Bcr-Abl. Indeed,
we observed that HS-543 increased cytochrome c release
and decreased the expression of Mcl-1 and survivin,
whereas increased the expression of Bax. These changes
led to an increase the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and
cleavage of PARP. These events were supported by in vivo
results, showing that HS-543 inhibited the tumor growth
and induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of
cleaved caspase-3 in tumor tissues of BaF3/T315I cells
xenograft mice. However, Imatinib did not change the
expression of apoptosis-related molecules in vitro and in
vivo. Overall, HS-543 showed to induce apoptosis via an
intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway in BaF3/T315I
cells, suggesting that the apoptosis effect by HS-543 may
be achieved by inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling pathways.
In conclusion, our results showed that the novel
selective Bcr-Abl TKI, HS-543, had potent anticancer
activity against the cells bearing wild type and T315I
mutant type Bcr-Abl. Given the mechanism of action and
the promising activity of HS-543 against Imatinib-resistant
CML cells, our results provide an important vision to
be considered for future clinical investigations in CML
patients with Imatinib resistance. Here, we suggest that
HS-543 may have great potential in overcoming T315I
mutation–induced Imatinib resistance.

grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Media 1640
(RPMI 1640), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. RPMI 1640; FBS and
penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from GIBCO
(Grand Island, NY). Imatinib was purchased from LC
laboratories (Woburn, MA), and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) were purchased from
Promega (Madison, WI).

Enzyme binding assay
The enzyme binding assay of HS-543 was performed
against a panel of 96 kinases using KINOMEscan assays
at the Ambit Biosciences Corp (San Diego, CA). In brief,
HS-543 was screened at 1 μM and results for primary
screen binding interactions were reported as ‘% Ctrl’. %
Ctrl Calculation = (HS-543 signal - positive control signal

where negative control is DMSO (100% Ctrl), and positive
control is control compound (0% Ctrl). Accordingly, lower
percent of control (POC) values represent stronger hits [8].

incubated in a humidified chamber at 4°C overnight with
primary antibodies including rabbit anti-p-Bcr-Abl (Tyr177)
and p-Stat5 (Tyr694) (Cell Signaling Technology). After
washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with
rabbit tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)
secondary antibody (Dianova, Germany) for 1 h at room
temperature. They were also stained with 4,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize the nuclei. The slides
were then washed twice with PBS and covered with
DAKO (Carpinteria, CA) before viewing with a confocal
laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Japan).
Also, after deparaffinization, immunostaining
was performed, using 8-μm-thick sections of the tumor
samples. The tissue sections were blocked with a normal
goat or horse serum (Vector Laboratories. Burlingame,
CA) for 1 h, and incubated at 4°C overnight in 1:50
dilutions of p-Bcr-Abl (Tyr177) and p-Stat5 (Tyr694) (Cell
Signaling Technology). After washing twice with PBS,
the cells were incubated with rabbit TRITC secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. They were also
stained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei. The slides were
then washed twice with PBS and covered with DAKO
before viewing with a confocal laser scanning microscope.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability of corresponding compounds was
determined by MTS assay. The cells were seeded and
treated onto 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 103 cells
per well and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The cells were
treated with either HS-543 or Imatinib at the indicated
concentrations (0.001–10 μM). Then, 20 μL of MTS
labeling mixture (1 mL of MTS/50 μL of phenazine
methosulfate [PMS]) was added to each well. After
incubation for 4 h, optical density (OD) was determined
using a microplate reader by measuring the absorbance at
wavelengths of 540 nm.

Western blotting
After the cells were treated with various
concentrations of either HS-543 or Imatinib and incubated
at 37°C for various times, they were collected and washed
with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, the
cells were lysed with a RIPA buffer (BIOSESANG,
Korea) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktails (GenDEPOT, Barker, TX). The proteins were
resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), and transferred onto the
nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were immunostained
with the appropriate primary antibodies followed
by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase. Antibody binding was detected with an
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Bio-Rad. Hercules,
CA). Primary monoclonal antibodies against the following
factors were used; p-Bcr-Abl (Tyr177), p-Crkl (Tyr207),
p-Stat5 (Tyr694), Bcr-Abl, Crkl, Stat5, cleaved PARP,
cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome c, survivin, Mcl-1, Bax
and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).
Secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).

Cell cycle arrest
BaF3/T315I cells were plated in 10 cm dishes with
RPMI medium and treated with HS-543 at the indicated
concentrations (0.5–5 μM). The cells were collected
and fixed in cold 70% ethanol at -25°C overnight. After
washing with PBS, the cells were subsequently stained
with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) and 100 μg/mL
RNase A for 30 min at room temperature in the dark; then
a flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the
percentage of cells in specific phases of sub G1 using a
FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences. San Jose,
CA). Flow cytometric data was analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star. Ashland, OR).

Hoechst staining and TUNEL staining
BaF3/T315I cells were plated in 48-well plates
with RPMI medium and treated with HS-543 (1 μM).
The cells were then suspended on poly-l-lysine-coated
slides, followed by Shandon Cytospin 3 for 5 min at 1000
rpm. They were then fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room
temperature, washed with PBS, and stained with 1 μg/mL
Hoechst 33342 (Cell Signaling Technology) for 20 min
at room temperature. The stained cells were examined
under a fluorescence microscope for evidence of nuclear
fragmentation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) was subsequently
performed using a TUNEL kit (Merck Millipore,
Temecula, CA) in accordance to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Immunofluorescence
BaF3/T315I cells were plated in 48-well plates
with RPMI medium and treated with 1 μM HS-543 for
various times. The cells were then suspended on poly-llysine–coated slides, followed by Shandon Cytospin 3
(Akribis Scientific, Cheshire, WA) for 3 min at 1000 rpm.
Thereafter, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 15 min at room temperature and washed twice
with PBS. The cells were blocked in 5% horse and goat
serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and then

Immunohistochemisry
The tissue sections were blocked with normal goat
or horse serum (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h, and incubated
at 4°C overnight in 1:50 dilutions of cleaved caspase-3
and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Cell
Signaling Technology). The sections were then incubated
with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:100) for 1 h. The
sections were visualized by an avidin–biotin peroxidase
complex solution using an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories),
which were then washed in PBS and developed with a
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate for 15
min and then counterstained with hematoxylin. At least
3 random fields of each section were examined at 400×
magnification and analyzed using a computer image
analysis system (Media Cybernetics. Rockville, MD).

Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ∆ψm)
was assessed using Multi-Parameter Apoptosis Assay Kit
(Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI). BaF3/T315I cells were treated
with 1 μM HS-543 for 12 h. The cells were incubated with
tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), and DAPI
staining at dark room condition. The cells were then
suspended on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, followed by
Shandon Cytospin 3 for 3 min at 1000 rpm. The slides
were covered with DAKO before viewing with a confocal
laser scanning microscope.

Analysis of cytochrome c localization
BaF3/T315I cells were treated with 1 μM HS-543 for
10 h. To label the mitochondria, the cells were incubated
with 100 nM mitochondrion-specific dye (MitoTracker®
Red FM; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 45 min
at 37˚C prior to fixation. The cells were then suspended on
poly-l-lysine-coated slides, followed by Shandon Cytospin
3 for 3 min at 1000 rpm. They were then fixed in 4% PFA
for 15 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. The
cells were incubated at 4˚C overnight with cytochrome c
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing twice
with PBS, the cells were incubated with mouse fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) secondary antibody (Dianova). The
cells were also stained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei.
The slides were then washed twice with PBS and covered
with DAKO before viewing with a confocal laser scanning
microscope.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation (S.D.). Statistical analysis was performed using
ANOVA and unpaired Student′s t-tests. The differences
were considered statistically significant when p < 0.01.

All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with the guidelines of the INHA Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (INHA IACUC at Inha
University Medical School, under the authority of project
number INHA 130318-197. The cells were harvested
and mixed in PBS (200 μL/mouse). Six weeks old male
BALB/c nude mice (Orient Bio, Korea) were inoculated
with 1 × 105 cells in the flank. When the tumor size
reached approximately 50-100 mm3, they were randomly
divided into 4 groups of 5 mice. Then, these mice were
given HS-543 or Imatinib by intraperitoneally 5 times
a week for 14 days. The treat group was fed with either
HS-543 (30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) or Imatinib (50 mg/kg),
and the control group was fed vehicle. Tumor size and
body weight were measured every 2 days. Tumor size was
calculated using the formula 0.5 × length × width2
