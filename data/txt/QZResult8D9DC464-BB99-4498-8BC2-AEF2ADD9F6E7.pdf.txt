BACKGROUND. Data regarding costs of prostate cancer treatment are scarce. This study investigates how initial
treatment choice affects short-term and long-term costs. METHODS. This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study followed prostate-cancer cases diagnosed in 2000 for 5 years using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare database. Men age 66 years, in Medicare fee for service, diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer in 2000 while residing in a SEER region, were matched to noncancer controls using age, sex, race, region,
comorbidity, and survival. On the basis of treatment received during the first 9 months postdiagnosis, patients were
assigned to watchful waiting, radiation, hormonal therapy, hormonal þ radiation, and surgery (may have received
other treatments). Incremental costs for prostate cancer were the difference in costs for prostate cancer cases versus
matched controls. Costs were divided into initial treatment (months 1 to 12), long-term (each 12 months thereafter),
and total (months 1 to 60). Sensitivity analyses excluded the last 12 months of life. RESULTS. A total of 13,769 prostate-cancer cases were matched to 13,769 noncancer controls. Watchful waiting had the lowest initial treatment
($4270) and 5-year total costs ($9130). Initial treatment costs were highest for hormonal þ radiation ($17,474) and
surgery ($15,197). At $26,896, 5-year total costs were highest for hormonal therapy only followed by hormonal þ radiation ($25,097) and surgery ($19,214). After excluding the last 12 months of life, total costs were highest for hormonal
þ radiation ($23,488) and hormonal therapy ($23,199). CONCLUSIONS. Patterns of costs vary widely based on initial
treatment. These data can inform patients and clinicians considering treatment options and policy makers interested

Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men, and because >90% of prostate cancer is clinically localized at diagnosis, the relative 5-year survival rate approaches 100%, the relative 10-year survival rate is 93%, and the relative
15-year survival rate is 79%.1 Over 60% of prostate cancers are diagnosed in men older than 65 years, making it an important
issue in the Medicare population.2 Because of the high survival rates, the long-term follow-up care for these men is critical.
With many treatment options, a paucity of comparative effectiveness data, and patients across a wide range of ages,
treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer remains controversial.3 Common treatments include surgery, radiation
therapy (external beam and brachytherapy), hormonal therapy, or combinations of the above. Because of the indolent nature of the disease, some men are appropriate for watchful waiting and do not require any treatment. However, few
randomized controlled trials across modalities have been conducted to inform treatment choice. Patient characteristics
such as age, comorbidities, and life expectancy may influence treatment decisions. Some patients, particularly younger
ones, may be appropriate for >1 treatment option. Because the treatment options have different side effect profiles,
patient preferences are particularly important in prostate cancer treatment decisions.4

The different treatment options also may have important economic consequences. In addition to initial
treatment cost differences, prostate cancer therapies can
have important short-term and long-term sequelae requiring various amounts of additional treatment.5 Some treatments rely on outpatient care, whereas others require
inpatient services. Because of differences in insurance
coverage, the setting in which care is delivered may have
important economic implications. Yet few studies have
investigated how treatment choice affects both the shortterm and long-term costs. This study examines how initial
treatment choice affects both the short-term and longterm costs for clinically localized prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Objectives
This was a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study. This
study aimed to compare the incremental costs of prostate
cancer based on initial treatment received. To calculate
incremental costs, we followed men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the year 2000 from 1 month before diagnosis6 to 5 years postdiagnosis (or until death). We
compared the costs of their care to controls without cancer
who were matched 1 to 1 to cases, using age, sex, race,
geographic region, comorbidity, and survival.
Data Source
We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare linked database, which combines clinical data from the SEER registries with Medicare administrative claims.7 We used the SEER registry to obtain data
on the cancer diagnosis and used the Medicare claims to
follow the subjects’ health services utilization longitudinally. In the year 2000, the SEER-17 registries covered
approximately 26% of the US population8; 16 registries
participate in the SEER-Medicare linkage. Data from a
5% random sample of Medicare patients in the SEER
regions were used to match controls to cancer cases.
Study Population
We included prostate cancer cases meeting these eligibility
criteria: 1) diagnosis of clinically localized prostate cancer
in 2000 while residing in a SEER region, 2) first or only
cancer in the SEER registry, 3) survived at least the initial
treatment period (ie, 9 months postdiagnosis), 4) age 66
years or older, and 5) enrolled continuously in the Medicare fee-for-service program (Parts A and B) from 1 year
before diagnosis (to calculate baseline comorbidity)

through 5 years postdiagnosis or until death. Patients enrolled in Medicare managed care at anytime during the
study period were excluded. Controls were matched to
cases on an individual basis using age (exact), sex (all
male), race (white, black, other), comorbidity index (0, 1,
2þ), geographic region, and duration of survival (based
on Zeliadt et al9).
Variables
By using the SEER data, we assessed age, race, geographic
region, urban/rural location, survival, tumor grade, and
socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status was separated
into quintiles and used as a categorical variable. By using
the Medicare claims, we constructed a comorbidity index
as a categorical variable (0, 1, 2þ).10-12 Treatment groups
were defined based on the treatments received during the
first 9 months after diagnosis, similarly to Burkhardt
et al.6 By using the Medicare claims, we assigned patients
to the following treatment groups: watchful waiting (if
they received no treatment in the first 9 months), radiation therapy only (including external beam and/or brachytherapy), hormonal therapy only, hormonal þ radiation
combination, and surgery (may have also received other
treatments). It is important to note that men may have
gone on to receive other treatments (eg, a man assigned to
watchful waiting may have received surgery later), but the
treatment group assignment was based solely on treatments during the first 9 months from diagnosis.
Costs were assessed using all Medicare paid amounts
from all standard analytic files, including inpatient, outpatient, physician/supplier, hospice, home health, and
durable medical equipment. Costs were categorized as
inpatient, outpatient, and other and combined into overall costs. We calculated costs in the short-term (months
1 through 12 from diagnosis), the long-term (each 12month period thereafter), and total 5-year costs (months
1 through 60 from diagnosis). We adjusted for the combination of inflation and different Medicare reimbursements by geographic region using methods similar to
those of Brown et al13 and Zeliadt et al,9 with data provided by Information Management Services, Inc. (IMC).
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the sociodemographic characteristics for
prostate cancer cases and controls, and compared the characteristics across the 5 treatment groups. We used analysis
of variance (ANOVA) to compare continuous variables
and chi-square tests for categorical variables. We also conducted multinomial logistic analyses using only prostate

cancer cases to determine which factors (age, race, comorbidity index, geographic region, urban/rural location,
socioeconomic status, grade) are associated with initial
treatment choice.
To calculate the incremental costs of prostate cancer,
we adjusted for geographic region,9,13 inflated all costs to
2007 dollars, subtracted the costs of controls from the
costs of their matched prostate cancer cases, and calculated
the mean incremental costs for each treatment group. The
increment was calculated for overall costs as well as for
costs grouped by setting (inpatient, outpatient, other).
Dollars were discounted 3% for each year beyond the first
year.14 For comparisons in each 12-month period, we
included only patients who had survived to that time. Differences in incremental costs over time by treatment
group were tested with linear mixed effects models that
included fixed effects for time and a random effect for
each matched pair. Differential changes in incremental
costs over time between treatment groups were tested
using the same approach. P values for differences are from
model-based likelihood ratio tests.
Because patterns of costs are quite different in the
period before death,15 we conducted a sensitivity analysis
excluding costs for the last 12 months of life. Finally, to
minimize the influence of selection bias in treatment
groups, a multinomial logistic regression model with
treatment group as the outcome and including age, race,
comorbidity, SEER region, urban/rural location, socioeconomic status, and grade as predictors was used to generate a propensity score for each matched pair. The inverses
of these scores were used as weights to test for differences
in the initial treatment and overall 5-year costs across
treatment groups.16,17
Because of the large sample size, we focus on the
actual differences between groups rather than P values.
When P values are reported, we used a threshold of
P<.0001 for statistical significance. The Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine Institutional Review Board deemed
this study exempt.

RESULTS
To obtain our analytic cohort, we started with 37,448
men diagnosed with prostate cancer (site 54) in the year
2000. After limiting to men with clinically localized disease and a valid month of diagnosis, 33,261 men
remained. Reasons for exclusion were age younger than
66 years (n ¼ 7652), surviving <9 months (n ¼ 614),
not being eligible for Medicare Part A and B during the
Cancer

study period (n ¼ 2734), enrollment in managed care (n
¼ 7632), and no matched control (n ¼ 860). Thus, the
final cohort included 13,769 prostate cancer cases
matched to 13,769 controls. The most common treatment was hormonal þ radiation combination (n ¼
3992; 29%), followed by watchful waiting (n ¼ 2805;
20%), radiation only (n ¼ 2582; 19%), surgery (n ¼
2200; 16%), and hormonal therapy only (n ¼ 2190;
16%). As evidence that men in the watchful waiting
group were being monitored closely, cases had more physician visits (ranging from an average of 9.9 visits in Year
1 to a low of 7.6 visits in Year 2) than their matched controls (ranging from 7.0 visits in Year 5 to 6.4 visits in
Year 2), with visits to urologists predominantly accounting for the difference between groups. Within the surgery
group, 118 (5%) men also received radiation therapy,
319 (15%) men also received hormonal therapy, and 67
(3%) men also received both hormonal and radiation
treatment in the 9 months postdiagnosis. The average
age ranged from 70.5 years for surgery to 78.9 years for
hormonal therapy only; between 64% and 77% of men
had no comorbidities, and between 85% and 90% of the
men in each treatment group were white (Table 1). The
percentage of men who survived at least 4 years ranged
from 95% in the surgery group to 71% in the hormonal
therapy only group.
As demonstrated by the ANOVA/chi-square tests
(Table 1) and the multinomial logistic regression (Table
2), patient characteristics had an important association
with treatment receipt. Compared with men in watchful
waiting, men on only hormonal therapy were older (relative risk [RR] per year, 1.07; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.05-1.08), and men in the radiation only (RR per
year, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.88-0.90), hormonal þ radiation
(RR per year, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.90-0.91), and surgery (RR
per year, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.72-0.75) groups were younger
(all P < .0001). Compared with white men, black men
were less likely to receive each of the treatments except
hormonal therapy only versus watchful waiting with RRs
ranging from 0.34 to 0.46 (all P < .0001). Compared
with men in the lowest socioeconomic status quintile,
men in the highest quintile were more likely to receive
radiation only (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.26-1.84) or surgery
(RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.43-2.19) versus watchful waiting
(both P < .0001). Compared with men with well-differentiated disease, men with moderately differentiated or
poorly differentiated/undifferentiated disease were more
likely to receive each of the treatments versus watchful
waiting (all P < .0001).

radiation ($17,474), followed by surgery ($15,197), with
watchful waiting lowest ($4270). After the first year, costs
for all treatment groups fall sharply and remain relatively
steady, except for watchful waiting, which drops to $733
in Year 2 then rises to $1836 in Year 3 and $2090 in Year
4, with an average total cost of $9130 across the 5 years.
Total costs were highest for hormonal therapy only
($26,896), which had relatively low initial treatment
costs, but the highest costs in Years 2 through 5. Hormonal þ radiation had the second highest total costs
($25,097) across the 5 years, although 70% of these costs
were experienced during Year 1. Similarly, for radiation
only and surgery, 78% and 79% of total costs were experienced in Year 1, respectively.
Because 23% of men in the surgery group also
received either radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or
both, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to estimate the
initial and total costs across the 5 years for the 1696 men

(77%) who received surgery only. Initial treatment costs
for men who received surgery only were $13,730 (vs
$15,197), and total costs across the 5 years were $16,327
(vs $19,214).
In terms of costs by setting of care, initial inpatient
costs were highest for surgery ($8765), followed by $3060
for hormonal therapy only and $2288 for watchful waiting. Initial outpatient costs were highest for hormonal þ
radiation ($16,656), followed by radiation only
($12,061). Across all 5 years and all treatment groups,
other costs tended to be low.
Table 4 presents the sensitivity analysis, excluding
the last 12 months of life for subjects who died. There was
little change in the patterns of initial costs; hormonal þ
radiation was still most expensive ($17,384), followed by
$15,083 for surgery, with the lowest costs for watchful
waiting ($3981). However, the sensitivity analysis did
affect the rankings of total costs. Instead of hormonal therapy being the most expensive, it was slightly less expensive
($23,199) versus hormonal þ radiation ($23,488).

Finally, we analyzed initial treatment (months 1
to 12) and 5-year total (months 1 to 60) costs using a
propensity score to minimize the impact of selection bias
associated with treatment receipt (Table 5). In most cases,
use of the propensity score adjusted the means only
slightly, likely because of the large sample size. The propensity score had the greatest impact on the initial treatment costs for the watchful waiting ($4270 vs $3936) and
hormonal therapy ($11,034 vs $11,710) groups, a
decrease of 8% and an increase of 6%, respectively. For
total cost estimates, use of the propensity score was associated with a 7% decrease in watchful waiting ($9130 vs
$8535) and a 7% increase in radiation therapy ($15,589
vs $16,653).

cancer and the controversies associated with determining
initial treatment, few studies have examined both the

short-term and long-term cost implications of the various
treatment options. In this study, we examined the characteristics of men in each of the treatment groups, as well as
the short-term and long-term costs associated with treatment choice. As expected, tumor grade and age had an important association with treatment group assignment.
Race (and to a lesser extent socioeconomic status) were
also associated with treatment group, indicative of potential disparities in care.
The costs of the treatment choices varied widely, not
only during the initial treatment period but across all 5
years. Whereas hormonal therapy was the second least expensive for initial treatment, it had the highest 5-year total
costs. This cost pattern may result from the relatively high
mortality rate in this group, although after excluding the
last 12 months of life, hormonal therapy still had the second highest 5-year total costs. To attempt to address the
selection bias associated with treatment, we used a propensity score for initial and total costs, but this adjustment
had little effect on our findings, likely because of our large
sample size, suggesting that our estimates are robust.
Treatment costs tended to decrease from Year 1 and
remain stable for most treatment groups, except costs for

the watchful waiting group increased after an initial
decrease. The different treatment options also varied in
terms of setting of care, which has important implications
for insurance coverage. For example, in fee-for-service
Medicare, Medicare pays the total amount for 60 inpatient days after beneficiaries reach their $1100 deductible
for each ‘‘spell of illness.’’ For outpatient services, the
annual deductible is only $155, but Medicare generally
covers only 80%, with beneficiaries paying 20%
coinsurance.18
The study most similar to this study was conducted
by Wilson et al19 using the CaPSURE database and selfreported health services utilization questionnaires. They
examined costs for the first 6 months of treatment and for
5.5 years of follow-up for men undergoing radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, cryotherapy, external beam radiation, androgen deprivation (hormonal) therapy, and
watchful waiting. Treatment costs during the first 6
months ranged from $2586 for watchful waiting to
$24,204 for external beam radiation. After initial treatment, annual costs were highest for androgen deprivation
therapy ($12,590) and lowest for watchful waiting
($5843). Because of differences in study populations (the
Wilson study was not limited to the Medicare population), treatment groups, cost analysis approach, and follow-up periods, the data are not directly comparable to
the findings presented here. Another CaPSURE study
only examined first-year costs.20
Other studies have also looked at the costs of localized prostate cancer using the SEER-Medicare linked
database. Burkhardt et al6 looked at initial treatment costs
of radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy, but compared only the short-term costs of 2 treatments. Other
studies also examined initial treatment costs only.21,22
Zeliadt et al9 used SEER-Medicare, but their study was

5397

Original Article

more focused on how prostate-specific antigen testing
affected initial treatment costs. By using a different database, Krupski et al examined costs of care specifically
related to androgen deprivation therapy.23 The prostate
cancer cost studies included in the review by Yabroff et
al24 either focused on short-term costs only or did not
compare costs by initial treatment.
Thus, in contrast to most of the previous research in
this area, our study includes a variety of treatment groups
and both short-term and long-term follow-up. Although
the Wilson et al19 study was similar, it relied on selfreported health services utilization data, which may be
incomplete. An advantage of the Wilson et al19 study,
however, was that it captured noncovered health services
(eg, outpatient pharmaceuticals), whereas we were limited
to claims for Medicare-covered services.
Other limitations of our analysis also warrant mention. First, because we used the SEER-Medicare database,
our sample does not include younger men or men in Medicare managed care. Second, the study may be subject to
some misclassification bias, because we relied on the claims
data to assign men to treatment groups. Missing or inaccurate codes may have resulted in some men being assigned to
the wrong treatment group. Also, some men may have
taken >9 months to decide on their treatment choice.
Although we made an effort to make the treatment groups
as homogenous as possible, heterogeneity in treatments
received remains, with for example various lengths of hormonal treatment. Third, we have classified men who
received no active treatment in the first 9 months postdiagnosis as watchful waiting. Active surveillance is increasingly
used in men with clinically insignificant cancer and a low
risk for progression. However, we did find that men in the
watchful waiting group had a greater number of physician
visits overall, and urologist visits in particular. Fourth, 23%
of men in the surgery treatment group also received other
treatments; however, a sensitivity analysis that included
men who underwent surgery only provides a basis for comparison. Fifth, our cost estimates include only direct medical costs and do not include other direct costs or any
indirect costs. Sixth, our cost estimates relied on the incremental costs of men with prostate cancer compared with
matched men without a cancer diagnosis. This approach
has been used previously,13 and has the advantage of providing a more comprehensive estimate of the costs of prostate cancer, but it does not assess which health services were
specifically related to prostate cancer. Seventh, we only followed men for 5 years postdiagnosis. Although this length
of follow-up provides useful information on the cost impli-

5398

cations beyond initial treatment, important costs may be
incurred >5 years out, and these costs were not included in
our study. Eighth, prostate cancer treatment is subject to
important selection bias. Although we used a propensity
score to compare the costs of care for like groups of men,
such adjustment may not completely account for differences between men in the various treatment groups. Ninth
and finally, this study was not a cost-effectiveness or comparative effectiveness analysis. Cost is only 1 consideration
in treatment selection, and quality of life and other outcomes are also important.
Despite these limitations, the findings of this study
are informative for a variety of purposes. Because most
prostate cancer patients will survive their disease, it is important to consider both the short-term and long-term cost
implications of the various treatment options. These data
demonstrate that patterns of care vary widely by treatment
group. We also assessed the robustness of our cost estimates
in sensitivity analyses that excluded the last 12 months of
life and that used a propensity score. Finally, we examined
the settings of care accounting for the costs by treatment
group. Because insurance coverage varies by setting of care,
this information is useful. These data can inform patients
and clinicians considering treatment options and policy
makers who may be interested in patterns of costs.
