Abstract
Recent advances in genome and transcriptome analysis have
contributed to the identiﬁcation of many potential cancerrelated genes. Furthermore, biological and clinical investigations of the candidate genes provide us with a better understanding of carcinogenesis and development of cancer treatment. Here, we report a novel role of KIAA1324 as a tumor
suppressor in gastric cancer. We observed that KIAA1324 was
downregulated in most gastric cancers from transcriptome
sequencing data and found that histone deacetylase was
involved in the suppression of KIAA1324. Low KIAA1324 levels
were associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients.
In the xenograft model, KIAA1324 signiﬁcantly reduced tumor

formation of gastric cancer cells and decreased development of
preformed tumors. KIAA1324 also suppressed proliferation,
invasion, and drug resistance and induced apoptosis in gastric
cancer cells. Through protein interaction analysis, we identiﬁed
GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa) as a KIAA1324binding partner. KIAA1324 blocked oncogenic activities of
GRP78 by inhibiting GRP78–caspase-7 interaction and suppressing GRP78-mediated AKT activation, thereby inducing
apoptosis. In conclusion, our study reveals a tumor suppressive
role of KIAA1324 via inhibition of GRP78 oncoprotein activities and provides new insight into the diagnosis and treatment
of gastric cancer. Cancer Res; 75(15); 3087–97. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Recently, with advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technology, analysis of genomic and transcriptomic alterations in
gastric cancer patients has been used to develop innovative
methods for diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer (3, 4).
Molecular drivers of gastric cancer have been suggested through
NGS-based genomic and transcriptomic analyses of mutation,
deletion, ampliﬁcation, fusion, and expression level. However,
because gastric cancer is regarded as a heterogeneous and complex
disease, the biological functions and clinical relevance of the
candidate driver genes should be scrutinized for their applications
in gastric cancer therapy.
GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa) is a well-known
therapeutic target gene that is highly activated in various
cancers, including gastric cancer (5–8). GRP78, also known as
HSPA5 (heat-shock protein alpha 5), is a chaperone involved in
protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
increases cell survival against apoptotic stresses, including
anticancer drugs, by interacting with proapoptotic factors such
as caspase-7 and BIK (9–11). In cancer, GRP78 is often relocalized to the plasma membrane (12, 13). Cell surface GRP78
activates AKT signaling through interaction with PI3K, thereby
promoting tumorigenesis (14, 15). GRP78 inhibitors, such as
small molecules and speciﬁc binding peptides, cause growth
inhibition and apoptosis of cancer cells. Therefore, more effective drugs targeting GRP78 have been developed for cancer
therapy (12, 16, 17). GRP78 has also been investigated and
suggested as a biomarker and therapeutic target for gastric
cancer therapy (18–20).
KIAA1324 gene, also known as EIG121 (estrogen-induced
gene 121), encodes a 1,013 amino acid (a.a.) transmembrane
protein that is highly conserved among species (21). The
correlation between KIAA1324 expression and prognosis
in endometrial, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer patients was

Gastric cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer and
the second leading cause of death from cancer worldwide (1).
Although clinical treatment for gastric cancer has improved,
gastric cancer therapy still remains challenging due to the difﬁculty in early detection of gastric cancer and complexities of the
disease (2). Therefore, it is crucial to investigate novel genes that
govern the development and progression of gastric cancer to
elucidate the process of gastric carcinogenesis and develop effective gastric cancer treatments.

previously reported (21–23), but the role of KIAA1324 in
gastric cancer has not been investigated yet. Deng and colleagues demonstrated that KIAA1324 localizes at the plasma
membrane and endomembranes and is involved in autophagy
(24). However, the biological functions of KIAA1324 are still
poorly understood.
Here, we identiﬁed KIAA1324 as a candidate gastric tumor
suppressor based on our transcriptome sequencing data from the
tissues of gastric cancer patients. To investigate the potential
tumor suppressive role of KIAA1324 in gastric cancer, we analyzed
the correlation between KIAA1324 expression and gastric cancer
patient prognosis and evaluated the tumorigenic abilities of
gastric cancer cells expressing exogenous KIAA1324 using in vitro
and in vivo assays. We observed that low KIAA1324 levels were
associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients.
KIAA1324 inhibited growth, invasiveness, and tumorigenic activity of gastric cancer cells and induced apoptosis by blocking the
oncogenic activities of GRP78. Taken together, our data suggest a
novel role of KIAA1324 as a tumor suppressor and a prognostic
indicator in gastric cancer.

Materials and Methods
Primary gastric cancer tissues
Fifty pairs of gastric cancer and normal matched control tissues
were obtained from the gastric cancer depository of the Gastrointestinal Division in Department of Surgery at Seoul National
University Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea). The Institutional
Review Board of the Seoul National University Hospital approved
management of the tissue depository and use of the tissues (IRB
no. H-0806-072-248).
Cell culture and transfection
Human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN28, AGS, and SNU16 were
obtained from Korean Cell Line Bank, authenticated by short
tandem repeat proﬁling. These cell lines were expended and used
within 10 passages. The cells were maintained in RPMI1640
containing 25 mmol/L HEPES (WelGENE) supplemented with
10% FBS (WelGENE), 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of
streptomycin (WelGENE). 293T cells were maintained in DMEM
(WelGENE) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin. FuGENE6 (Roche Applied
Science) was used as a transfection reagent.
Establishment of gastric cancer cells expressing the KIAA1324
gene or KIAA1324 shRNA
We established MKN28 and AGS cell lines expressing
KIAA1324 in a doxycycline-dependent manner (tet-on) using a
retroviral system. SNU16 cell lines stably expressing control or
KIAA1324 shRNA were generated as described previously (25). To
establish MKN28 and AGS cell lines expressing KIAA1324 in a
doxycycline-dependent manner (tet-on), the human KIAA1324
gene was cloned into pCMV-3HA vector (Clontech). For virus
generation, 3HA-tagged KIAA1324 gene was inserted into a retroviral vector, pRetroX (Clontech). Viruses containing KIAA1324
gene or tetracycline response activator gene were produced
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Biolabs, Inc.).
MKN28 and AGS tet-on KIAA1324 cells were generated by infection with these viruses and selected by 2 mg/mL G418 and
2 mg/mL puromycin. For KIAA1324 knockdown, lentiviral constructs containing KIAA1324 shRNA (TRCN0000263309 and

3088 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

TRCN0000263310) were purchased from Sigma. SNU16 cell
lines stably expressing control or KIAA1324 shRNA were generated by lentiviral infection and selected with 2 mg/mL puromycin.
Annexin V–positive cell population analysis
Annexin V staining was performed with BD Pharmingen
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were trypsinized and washed
twice with PBS. The cells were incubated in binding buffer containing Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Stained cells
were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using CELLQUEST program
(Becton Dickinson).
Statistical analyses
All quantitative data are expressed as the mean  SD. Kaplan–
Meier analysis and Pearson c2 tests were performed using SPSS
version 21.0 statistical software (IBM SPSS). Student t tests and
one-way ANOVA were conducted using GraphPad Prism version
5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). P < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
KIAA1324 expression is suppressed in most gastric cancers
To identify novel gastric cancer–related genes, we analyzed
transcriptome sequencing data acquired from 16 paired normal
and tumor tissues of gastric cancer patients and 18 gastric cancer
cell lines (26) and sorted differentially expressed genes (DEG)
between gastric cancer and normal tissues (P < 0.01 with >2-fold
change; Fig. 1A). Among the DEGs, we focused on KIAA genes,
which were initially identiﬁed through the Kazusa cDNA project,
because unknown genes often provide new insight into understanding cancer, and most of KIAA genes have remained functionally uncharacterized (27). We conﬁrmed that expression
patterns of the selected KIAA genes in gastric cancer cell lines
were similar to those in primary tumor tissues (Fig. 1A). In
particular, our data showed upregulation of KIAA1524, which is
also known as CIP2A (cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase
2A) and was reported as an oncogene in gastric cancer (28).
However, other KIAA genes have been poorly investigated, especially in gastric cancer. In this study, we focused our attention on
the role of KIAA1324, which is the most signiﬁcant downregulated KIAA gene in this set of gastric tissues and cancer cell lines.
Suppressed KIAA1324 expression in most tumor tissues and
gastric cancer cell lines was further validated using quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR; Supplementary Fig. S1). We
also examined KIAA1324 expression in paired tissues of additional gastric cancer patients using qRT-PCR. As expected,
KIAA1324 expression was signiﬁcantly suppressed in cancer tissues (P < 0.0005; Fig. 1B). Paired comparison analysis of the
tissues showed that 78% of patients had low levels of KIAA1324 at
the tumor site compared with the normal region (Fig. 1C). These
results were further supported by public microarray data
(GSE13861; ref. 29), which showed low KIAA1324 expression in
gastric tumor tissues (P ¼ 0.0002; Fig. 1D).
The loss of gene expression is mainly caused by genetic alteration or epigenetic modiﬁcation. Therefore, to investigate the
mechanism by which KIAA1324 is regulated in gastric cancer cell
lines, we ﬁrst examined the correlation between gene copy number variation (CNV) and transcription level using CCLE database
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Copy number of KIAA1324

KIAA1324, a Novel Gastric Tumor Suppressor

Figure 1.
KIAA1324 was downregulated in gastric cancer. A, transcriptome sequencing analysis of mRNA level of KIAA genes in paired tissue samples from 16 gastric
cancer patients and 18 gastric cancer cell lines. B and C, KIAA1324 mRNA expression levels in paired tissue samples from 50 gastric cancer patients were examined
using qRT-PCR (B) and comparative analysis (C) of the paired tissues was performed. D, KIAA1324 expression in gastric cancer patients was examined from
public microarray data (GSE13861; P ¼ 0.0002). E, epigenetic modulation assay was conducted using the inhibitors, decitabine (Dec) and MS-275. KIAA1324
mRNA levels in MKN1, MKN28, and SNU638 cells were assessed using RT-PCR two days after treatment with decitabine and MS-275. Student t tests were
performed for statistical analysis (   , P < 0.0005). Error bars indicate SD.

gene in 29 gastric cancer cell lines was barely changed and
KIAA1324 expression was low in most gastric cancer cell lines.
This result suggested that suppressed KIAA1324 expression is
independent of copy number variation (CNV). Next, we
explored whether KIAA1324 expression was regulated epigenetically using decitabine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, and
MS-275, a synthetic histone deacetylase inhibitor. While MS275 treatment restored KIAA1324 transcription in these gastric
cancer cell lines with negligible expression, decitabine did not
inﬂuence KIAA1324 expression (Fig. 1E). Combination treatment with MS-275 and decitabine in MKN1 cells enhanced
restoration of KIAA1324 transcription compared with MS-275
treatment alone, but not in MKN28 and SNU638 cells. It has
been known that densely methylated DNA associates with
transcriptionally repressive chromatin characterized by the
presence of underacetylated histones, and these two epigenetic
processes have been dynamically linked (30). Our data suggest
that the density of CpG island methylation and the level of
histone deacetylation of the KIAA1324 gene vary among the
three cell lines used in our study. Taken together, these results
suggest that epigenetic inhibition of KIAA1324 may be favored

during carcinogenesis, indicating a possible role of KIAA1324
as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer.
Low levels of KIAA1324 are associated with poor prognosis in
gastric cancer patients
To evaluate the clinical impact of KIAA1324, we performed a
gastric tumor tissue microarray using the anti-KIAA1324 antibody
and tumor tissues from 428 patients. As shown in Fig. 2A, the
tumor tissues were classiﬁed into four groups (negative, weak,
moderate, or strong) according to KIAA1324 expression. On the
basis of this classiﬁcation, we analyzed the cumulative survival
rate of gastric cancer patients who provided the tumor tissues
using the Kaplan–Meier test (Fig. 2B). We found that lower
KIAA1324 expression was correlated with reduced survival rates
of patients (P < 0.001). We also analyzed the relationship between
KIAA1324 expression and clinicopathologic features (Fig. 2C).
Patients aged 65 years or younger had lower KIAA1324 expression
compared with older patients (P ¼ 0.038). However, KIAA1324
expression was not associated with gender (P ¼ 0.389). KIAA1324
expression was negatively correlated with tumor invasion
(P ¼ 0.001), pTNM stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis

(P ¼ 0.005), and distant metastasis (P ¼ 0.001). In particular,
patients who had KIAA1324-deﬁcient gastric tumors tended to
develop more advanced and invasive gastric cancer. These results
indicate that low levels of KIAA1324 expression are signiﬁcantly
correlated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients.
KIAA1324 inhibits in vivo tumor formation of gastric cancer
cells
To investigate a possible role of KIAA1324 as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, we examined the effect of KIAA1324 on in vivo
tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells. For the xenograft assay, we
generated stable MKN28 gastric cancer cell lines with tetracyclineinducible (tet-on) luciferase (Luc) or KIAA1324 expression. Luciferase was used as a control. We injected the MKN28 cells subcutaneously into mice after inducing KIAA1324 expression with
doxycycline, a tetracycline analog, and observed tumor formation
(Fig. 3A). Induction of KIAA1324 dramatically decreased the
tumor formation ability of MKN28 cells as demonstrated by
signiﬁcantly reduced tumor sizes and weights at the time of
harvest (P < 0.0005; Fig. 3B–D). Next, we investigated whether
KIAA1324 affects the development of preformed tumors. Three
weeks after subcutaneous injection of MKN28 cells with tet-on
Luc or KIAA1324, the mice were fed water containing doxycycline
every other day for a month (up to 7 weeks) to induce KIAA1324
expression (Fig. 3E). Tumor formation was observed within 3
weeks after injection. We measured tumor sizes weekly and
obtained tumor weights at the time of harvest (Fig. 3E–H). The
results showed that KIAA1324 induction signiﬁcantly reduced the
size (P < 0.0005) and weight (P < 0.001) of preformed tumors.

3090 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

KIAA1324 expression in tumors was veriﬁed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3I).
These data demonstrate that KIAA1324 inhibits the tumorigenic
activity of gastric cancer cells in vivo and the development of
preformed tumors.
KIAA1324 suppresses growth, invasion, and drug resistance of
gastric cancer cells
We further investigated whether KIAA1324 inﬂuences the characteristic features of gastric cancer cells, including proliferation,
invasiveness, and drug resistance. In addition to MKN28 cells, we
established stable AGS gastric cancer cell lines with tet-on Luc or
KIAA1324. The proliferation assay showed that KIAA1324
remarkably inhibited growth of MKN28 and AGS cells (Fig.
4A). KIAA1324 also suppressed anchorage-dependent and -independent colony forming activities of gastric cancer cells (Fig. 4B
and C). To examine the effect of KIAA1324 on the invasiveness of
gastric cancer cells, we assessed the migration and invasion ability
of MKN28 and AGS cells expressing KIAA1324. As shown in Fig.
4D and E, KIAA1324 signiﬁcantly reduced the migration and
invasion of gastric cancer cells. We next explored whether
KIAA1324 regulates the drug resistance of gastric cancer cells by
treating MKN28 and AGS cells expressing KIAA1324 with anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and etoposide (Fig. 4F). Cells
expressing KIAA1324 showed decreased cell viability in presence
of cisplatin or etoposide compared with control cells. In addition,
cisplatin- and etoposide-mediated apoptosis were increased in
KIAA1324-expressing MKN28 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
These results suggested that KIAA1324 caused the cells to become
more sensitive to anticancer drugs. To further investigate whether

the loss of KIAA1324 inﬂuences proliferation and drug resistance
in SNU16 gastric cancer cells with KIAA1324 expression, we made
an SNU16 cell line stably expressing KIAA1324 shRNA using a
lentiviral system. KIAA1324 knockdown was conﬁrmed by qRTPCR (Fig. 4G). Although KIAA1324 knockdown did not dramatically affect SNU16 cell proliferation, it markedly enhanced
cisplatin resistance (Fig. 4H and I). Moreover, loss of KIAA1324
decreased cisplatin- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4J
and Supplementary Fig. S4). Taken together, our data demonstrate that KIAA1324 inhibits the growth, invasiveness, and drug
resistance of gastric cancer cells.

Ectopic expression of KIAA1324 induces apoptosis of gastric
cancer cells
To examine whether KIAA1324 induces apoptosis of gastric
cancer cells, we performed annexin V staining and ﬂow cytometry
analysis (Fig. 5A). Induction of KIAA1324 expression increased
the annexin V–positive cell population, indicating that KIAA1324
induced apoptosis in MKN28 and AGS cells. We also conﬁrmed
KIAA1324-mediated apoptosis using a TUNEL assay (Fig. 5B).
Next, we examined the expression of apoptosis markers using
immunoblotting and RT-PCR. We veriﬁed activation of caspase-3,
an apoptosis effector caspase protein, in gastric cancer cells

www.aacrjournals.org

expressing KIAA1324 by detecting cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig.
5C). Interestingly, expression of proapoptotic genes, such as BAX
and BIM, were also increased by KIAA1324 (Fig. 5D). In addition,
we investigated whether KIAA1324 affects cell-cycle distribution.
KIAA1324 did not have a considerable effect on cell cycle, while
inducing apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results suggest
that KIAA1324 exerts main effect on apoptosis. Because it has
been previously mentioned that KIAA1324-mediated apoptosis
might occur through excessive autophagy (24), we examined the
expression of LC3B, an autophagy marker (Supplementary Fig.
S6). However, we observed no signiﬁcant difference between
control and KIAA1324-expressing cells. In summary, our data
suggest that KIAA1324 induces apoptosis through activation of a
caspase cascade rather than autophagy.

The transmembrane domain of KIAA1324 is important for
KIAA1324-mediated apoptosis
It has been reported that KIAA1324 is mainly localized in the
membrane fraction, and deletion of its transmembrane domain
(TM) limits its localization to the cytosol (24). To explore the role
of TM in KIAA1324-induced apoptosis, we generated MKN28 and
AGS cells with a tet-on TM-deleted mutant of KIAA1324
(KIAA1324 DTM). We conﬁrmed expression of KIAA1324 DTM

using immunoblotting (Fig. 6A and B). As shown in Fig. 6C, TM
deletion resulted in defective cellular localization of KIAA1324.
KIAA1324 DTM neither increased the annexin V–positive cell
population nor activated caspase-3 (Fig. 6D and E). These results
indicate that the TM of KIAA1324 is responsible for its ability to
induce apoptosis as well as its cellular localization.
To further examine which region of KIAA1324, besides TM, is
required for KIAA1324-mediated apoptosis, we analyzed apoptosis in cells expressing KIAA1324 mutants with deletion of the Nterminal side (DN) or C-terminal side (DC) of the TM. KIAA1324
DC exhibited similar cellular localization and apoptosis induction

as wild-type KIAA1324 (Supplementary Fig. S7), whereas
KIAA1324 DN did not induce apoptosis even though its localization was similar to wild-type KIAA1324 (Supplementary Fig.
S8). To ﬁnd more speciﬁc domain that is important for KIAA1324mediated apoptosis, we examined the effects of a.a. 304–931
(DC1) and a.a. 657–931 (DC2) of KIAA1324 on apoptosis induction. While KIAA1324 DC induced apoptosis, DC1 and DC2 did
not have any effect in KIAA1324-mediated apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S9). These results demonstrate that KIAA1324
induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through the TM and
a.a. 1–303 region, suggesting that its cellular localization and the

a.a. 1–303 region are crucial for KIAA1324-mediated apoptosis in
gastric cancer cells.
GRP78 oncoprotein is identiﬁed as a KIAA1324-binding
partner
To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of KIAA1324-induced
apoptosis, we identiﬁed KIAA1324-speciﬁc binding partners
through protein interaction analysis using a formaldehyde
cross-linking method (Fig. 7A; ref. 31). We found GRP78 as a
KIAA1324-binding partner and validated the interaction between
KIAA1324 and GRP78 (Fig. 7B). Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
also demonstrated that KIAA1324 colocalized with GRP78 (Fig.
7C). Because GRP78 is predominantly localized in the ER, we
investigated whether KIAA1324 also exists in the ER by examining
colocalization with PDI, an ER marker. As expected, KIAA1324
was found in the ER (Supplementary Fig. S10). KIAA1324 was
also located in the cell membrane in accordance with the previous
report (24).
To determine the binding region of GRP78 with KIAA1324, we
examined interactions between KIAA1324 and various domaindeleted mutants of GRP78 (Fig. 7D–F). Immunoprecipitation
assays showed that a.a. 1–80 of GRP78, which contains Thr37, an
ATP-binding site (32), was required for the GRP78–KIAA1324
interaction. In addition, analysis of the interactions between
GRP78 and domain-deleted mutants of KIAA1324 demonstrated
that a.a. 1–303 of KIAA1324 was responsible for the interaction
with GRP78 (Fig. 7G and H and Supplementary Fig. S11).

KIAA1324 inhibits the oncogenic activity of GRP78
GRP78 increases cancer cell survival by exerting antiapoptotic
activity by interacting with caspase-7 in the ER and by activating
pro-proliferative PI3K/AKT signaling in the cell membrane. Given
that inhibition of GRP78 induces apoptosis and increases anticancer drug sensitivity in gastric cancer cells (16, 20), we investigated the effect of siRNA-mediated GRP78 knockdown on
MKN28 cells. As expected, we found that GRP78 knockdown
induced apoptosis of MKN28 cells and decreased AKT phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S12).
It has been reported that Thr37 of GRP78 is important for ATPinduced conformational change, which is critical for the interaction of GRP78 with its binding partners (32), and the N-terminal
side of the GRP78 ATPase domain is required for AKT activation
(15). Therefore, because KIAA1324 interacted with N-terminal
region of GRP78, we ﬁrst investigated whether KIAA1324 affects
GRP78 binding to caspase-7. Indeed, KIAA1324 wild-type and DC
mutant blocked the interaction between GRP78 and caspase-7
and induced cleavage of caspase-7 (Fig. 7I). However, KIAA1324
DTM and N-terminal region (N) did not affect GRP78 binding to
caspase-7 despite their interaction with GRP78. This result suggests that the TM of KIAA1324 is required for KIAA1324 to
interfere with the interaction between GRP78 and caspase-7. Next,
we investigated whether KIAA1324-mediated regulation of
GRP78 affects AKT activation by examining AKT phosphorylation
(Fig. 7J). The result showed reduction of AKT phosphorylation in
MKN28 cells expressing KIAA1324. Taken together, these data

demonstrate that KIAA1324 not only inhibits the interaction
between GRP78 and caspase-7, but also may regulate GRP78mediated AKT activation, suggesting that KIAA1324 may exert
antitumor activity by suppressing the oncogenic activities of
GRP78 (Supplementary Fig. S13).

Discussion
To date, a number of tumor suppressor genes have been
identiﬁed and investigated for their function in tumorigenesis.
However, many potential tumor suppressor genes remain
unknown and uncharacterized. Recently, analysis of genetic
alterations and transcriptome changes in cancer tissues and cell
lines using NGS has become a promising method to identify
candidate tumor suppressor genes (3, 33). Moreover, studying the
biological functions of these genes improves our understanding of
the underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis and aids in cancer
prevention and therapeutics. In the current study, KIAA1324 was
identiﬁed as a novel tumor suppressor that is downregulated in
human primary gastric cancer tissues and cell lines through total
mRNA sequencing analysis (Fig. 1). CNV analysis and an epigenetic modulation assay of gastric cancer cell lines showed that
suppression of KIAA1324 expression in gastric cancer cells is
caused by epigenetic regulation rather than genetic alteration

(Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S2). A study of the clinical impact
of KIAA1324 demonstrated that KIAA1324 can be used as a
biomarker for prognostic prediction of gastric cancer (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, investigation of the effects of KIAA1324 on proliferation, tumorigenic activity, and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells
indicated that KIAA1324 may function as a gastric tumor suppressor (Figs. 3, 4, 5). In particular, induction of KIAA1324
expression in preformed tumors signiﬁcantly reduced tumor size
(Fig. 3E–H). This result suggests that, with remarkable recent
developments in tumor-speciﬁc drug or gene delivery system for
cancer therapy (34, 35), application of KIAA1324 gene delivery or
a KIAA1324-inducible drug release system speciﬁcally targeting
gastric tumors can be a feasible strategy for gastric cancer therapy.
GRP78 has been regarded as a promising therapeutic target for
cancer therapy. As GRP78 enhances cancer cell survival by protecting cancer cells from apoptotic stresses such as anticancer
drugs, targeting GRP78 increases efﬁcacy of cancer treatment
(17). In cancer, the role of GRP78 in the cell membrane as well
as the ER have drawn interest because increased cell surface GRP78
is detected in various cancers. GRP78 is principally localized in the
ER lumen; however, it also has been demonstrated that GRP78
has putative transmembrane domains and localizes at the cellular
membrane as well as the ER membrane (9, 13). Cell surface
GRP78 has been reported to regulate proliferation, migration,

and invasion of cancer cells via regulation of various cellular
signaling pathways, including the TGFb and AKT signal pathways
(36–39). Peptides targeting cell surface GRP78 have suppressed
tumor growth and invasion, suggesting that GRP78-targeting
peptides could be a therapeutic strategy for patients with cell
surface GRP78-positive tumors (12, 40). We demonstrated that
KIAA1324 physically interacted with the N-terminal domain of
GRP78 through its N-terminal region and might regulate GRP78mediated AKT activation (Fig. 7). A domain prediction program
indicated that the N-terminal region of KIAA1324 may be an
extracellular domain, and a previous report and our immunoﬂuorescence data showed that KIAA1324 localized at cell membrane
(24). Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that KIAA1324 may
also modulate cell surface GRP78 extracellularly through its Nterminal domain. On the basis of our ﬁndings, identiﬁcation of
the critical motif of KIAA1324, which is necessary for the interaction with GRP78, may be a platform for the development of

www.aacrjournals.org

GRP78-targeting KIAA1324 peptides as anticancer therapeutic
agents.
In cancer, the role of GRP78 as a receptor at the cell surface
depends on extracellular ligands. Alpha-2 macroglobulin interacts with the N-terminal region of cell surface GRP78 and activates
AKT signaling, leading to increased cell proliferation (41). However, Kringle 5 induces caspase-7 activation by binding to cell
surface GRP78 (40). Par-4 also induces apoptosis via interaction
with cell surface GRP78 and activation of the FADD-caspase 8–
caspase-3 pathway (42). In this study, we demonstrated that
through interaction with GRP78, KIAA1324 induced activation
of caspase-3 and -7 and decreased AKT signaling. Considering
previous reports, our data suggest that KIAA1324 may release
caspase-7 from GRP78 in the ER, activate the FADD-caspase
8–caspase-3 pathway in the cell membrane, and block alpha-2
macroglobulin from binding to cell surface GRP78, thereby
inducing apoptosis.

Deng and colleagues reported that KIAA1324 was predominantly in the membrane fraction and colocalized with autophagosome markers, suggesting that it is involved in autophagy (24).
They also suggested that the observed KIAA1324-induced apoptosis in 293T cells occurred due to excessive autophagy. However, autophagic death and apoptosis are regarded as different
types of cell death (43, 44). Furthermore, we could not observe
KIAA1324-mediated autophagy in gastric cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). In our study, KIAA1324 induced cell death via an
apoptotic mechanism. We found that KIAA1324 blocked the
interaction between GRP78 and proapoptotic caspase-7, suggesting that KIAA1324 induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by
inhibiting the antiapoptotic activity of GRP78.
It has been reported that transmembrane proteins in the ER,
such as TMEM166 and TMEM214, are involved in the induction
of apoptosis (45, 46). TMEM166 contains a single transmembrane domain and induces both autophagy and apoptosis. Compared with normal tissues, TMEM166 is downregulated in gastric
adenocarcinoma (47). Adenovirus-mediated introduction of
TMEM166 suppressed tumor growth through autophagy and
apoptosis (48). TMEM214, which contains two transmembrane
domains and is localized to the outer membrane of the ER,
regulates ER stress-induced apoptosis through activation of caspase-4 (46). Here, we observed that KIAA1324, a transmembrane
protein, induced apoptosis in the ER, and TM deletion abolished
its apoptotic activity even though the TM deletion mutant bound
to GRP78. It is possible that these transmembrane proteins
interact with each other at the ER membrane to induce apoptosis
by regulating GRP78. Further investigation of the interaction
among these proteins will provide a better understanding of
KIAA1324-mediated apoptosis in cancer.
AKT signaling plays a key role in various cellular processes
including proliferation, survival, metabolism, differentiation,
and apoptosis (49). Loss of AKT inhibitors such as PTEN and
SHIP or upregulation of AKT activators such as GRP78 and Src
induces dysregulation of AKT activation and has been implicated
in carcinogenesis. In the current study, we observed that
KIAA1324 reduced AKT phosphorylation in MKN28 cells. This
phenomenon may be attributed to KIAA1324-mediated inhibition of GRP78 activity. However, we cannot exclude the possibilities that KIAA1324 regulates AKT signaling directly or through
interaction with other regulators of AKT. Therefore, further studies
to explore the possibilities will support tumor suppressive role of
KIAA1324 as a negative regulator of AKT.
The role of KIAA1324 in cancer has been evaluated only in
endometrial, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer to date (21–23). In
type I endometrial cancer, KIAA1324 expression is higher at early
stage than that of benign tumors, but reduced in high grade and
stage endometrial carcinoma. In addition, KIAA1324 is downregulated in type II endometrial cancer, which is more aggressive
than type I. In pancreatic cancer, KIAA1324 is also highly

expressed in early-stage tumor, but its expression is decreased in
advanced cancer. High KIAA1324 expression in endometrial and
pancreatic carcinoma is correlated with favorable prognosis in
cancer patients. However, in high-grade serous carcinoma of the
ovary/peritoneum, high expression of ERa and KIAA1324 is
associated with poor survival in cancer patients. This indicates
that KIAA1324 may play different roles in various types of cancers.
In our study, we provide evidence that supports a tumor suppressive role of KIAA1324 in gastric cancer through induction of
apoptosis. Our study may lead to further investigation of the
function of KIAA1324 in other cancers.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that KIAA1324 was
epigenetically downregulated in gastric cancer and positively
correlated with prognosis of gastric cancer patients. We also
revealed that KIAA1324 suppressed growth of gastric cancer cells
and tumors by inhibiting the oncogenic activity of GRP78. Taken
together, we suggest KIAA1324 as a novel gastric tumor suppressor
and provide a new insight for the application of KIAA1324 in the
diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.
