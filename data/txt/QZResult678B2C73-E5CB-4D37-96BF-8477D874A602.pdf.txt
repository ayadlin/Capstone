ABSTRACT
Background: Dobutamine is commonly used for clinical management of heart
failure and its pharmacological effects have long been investigated as inotropics
via β–receptor activation. However, there is no electrophysiological evidence if
dobutamine contributes inotropic action due at least partially to the reverse mode of
Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) activation.
Methods: Action potential (AP), voltage-gated Na+ (INa), Ca2+ (ICa), and K+
(Ito and IK1) currents were observed using whole-cell patch technique before and
after dobutamine in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from adult mouse hearts.
Another sets of observation were also performed with Kb-r7943 or in the solution
without [Ca2+]o.
Results: Dobutamine (0.1–1.0 μM) significantly enhanced the AP depolarization
with prolongation of AP duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent fashion. The
density of INawas also increased concentration-dependently without alternation
of voltage-dependent steady-status of activation and inactivation, reactivation as
well. Whereas, the activities for ICa, Ito, and IK1 were not changed by dobutamine.
Intriguingly, the dobutamine-mediated changes in AP repolarization were abolished
by 3 μM Kb-r7943 pretreatment or by simply removing [Ca2+]o without affecting
accelerated depolarization. Additionally, the ratio of APD50/APD90 was not significantly
altered in the presence of dobutamine, implying that effective refractory period was
remain unchanged.
Conclusion: This novel finding provides evidence that dobutamine upregulates of
voltage-gated Na+ channel function and Na+ influx-induced activation of the reverse
mode of NCX, suggesting that dobutamine may not only accelerate ventricular
contraction via fast depolarization but also cause Ca2+ influx, which contributes its
positive inotropic effect synergistically with β-receptor activation without increasing
the arrhythmogenetic risk.

INTRODUCTION

and recording solutions were purchased from the regular
commercial sources.

Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic drug that has
long been used in the treatment of heart failure [1] and
cardiogenic shock [2] on the basis of its positive inotropic
action. Its primary mechanism is direct stimulation of
β-receptors of the sympathetic nervous system coupled with
intracellular Ca2+ mobilization through G-protein-couple
receptor and cyclic adenosine-monphosphate (cAMP)
pathway. However, if other potential mechanism except for
β-receptor stimulation involved in dobutamine-mediated
intracellular Ca2+ mobilization is not fully understand so
far. Recent finding has shown that Na+ influx during the
early phase of action potential (AP) induces an intracellular
Ca2+ increase through activation of the reverse mode of
Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) [3–5] and there is no such
report in the literatures if dobutamine share the similar
mechanisms. Therefore, this study was designed to answer
the following questions regarding the electrophysiological
profiles of dobutamine: [1] if voltage-gated Na+ channel
is activated; [2] if Na+ influx induces the  Ca2+ entry via
the reverse mode of NCX in an extracellular-dependent
manner; and [3] the relation between [1] and [2]. To
experimentally verify these questions, both AP and
voltage-gated ion channel currents (INa, ICa, IK1, and Ito)
were investigated on ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated
from adult mouse heart, respectively, using whole-cell
patch technique [6, 7] before and after administration
of dobutamine. Additionally, separate sets of currentclamp observations were also performed by pretreatment
of cardiomyocytes with Kb-r7943, selective NCX
blocker, with normal Tyrode’s solution or calcium free
Tyrode’s solution to verify the involvement of NCX and
Ca2+-dependency. This observation provides a solid
evidence to suggest that dobutamine mediates Na+ influx
through voltage-gated Na+ channel during AP depolarization
and consequently induces an extracellular Ca2+-dependent
Ca2+ influx through the reverse mode of NCX in ventricular
cardiomyocyte of adult mouse heart.

Ventricular cardiomyocyte isolation
Adult mouse single ventricular cardiomyocytes
were isolated using Langendorff-perfused mouse
hearts and standard enzymatic techniques as previously
reported with minor modifications [9]. Briefly, mice
were heparinized and sacrificed by cervical dislocation.
The hearts were rapidly removed and retrogradely
perfused through the aorta using a modified Langendorff
apparatus. The preparation was perfused with calcium free
Tyrode’s solution (in mM: NaCl 126, KCl 5.4, HEPES 10,
NaH2PO4 0.33, MgCl2 1.0, taurine 10, glucose 10, and pH
adjusted to 7.4 with 1.0 N NaOH) for 5 min, and then
switched to digestive solution (calcium free  Tyrode’s
solution containing Collagenase type-II 0.4 mg/ml,
protease 0.02 mg/ml and BSA 1.0 mg/ml). Left atria and
ventricular  tissue were collected and titrated gently in
calcium free Tyrode’s solution containing 0.5% BSA to
obtain single cells. All solutions were gassed with 95%
oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide. Single rod-shaped and
Ca2+ tolerant cells with clear cross-striations (Figure 1A)
were used for electrophysiological investigation.

Electrophysiology
Both current- (AP) and voltage-clamp recordings
(INa, ICa, Ik1, and Ito) were conducted using standard
whole-cell patch-clamp techniques [10, 11] with an
Axopatch 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Briefly, The
recording electrodes (Borosilicate glass, Sutter) were pulled
(P-97, Sutter Instruments) and polished (F-83, Narishige)
down to 1.2 – 1.8 MΩ when filled with pipette solution.
After formation of the gigaohm-seal, the capacitance was
electronically compensated and the cell membrane under
the pipette tip was then ruptured by a brief increase in
suction, forming the whole-cell recording configuration.
After 2–5 min period for intracellular dialysis, the Tyrode
solution was changed by bath perfusion of extracellular
recording solution designed for INa, ICa, Ik1, and Ito
recordings, respectively. All cells were recorded at room
temperature (22 – 23°C). Current amplitude data of each
cell were normalized to its cell capacitance (current density,
pA/pF). Current-voltage relationship (I-V curve) was
presented by the currents normalized by the peak currents.
Voltage-dependent activation and steady-state inactivation
profiles were calculated by Boltzmann fitting function.

Changes in AP discharge profiles in the presence
of dobutamine
In isolated ventricular cardiomyocyte (Figure 1A,
n  = 12), AP discharge parameters were altered by

without shifting in the peak of INa (Figure 2A, inset),
however, voltage-dependent steady-status activation and
inactivation, as well as reactivation profiles were not
markedly changed (Figure 2C–2D) by dobutamine. The
EC50 of dobutamine for the density of INa was estimated
at 0.143 μM, which is correspondent well with the EC50
for UVMAX of AP simply because the INa is the current
underlying the AP depolarization.

dobutamine in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 1B–1D, Table 1), manifested as slight but
significant increase in the resting membrane potential
(RMP) and AP firing threshold (APFT) toward the
hyperpolarized direction, also increase in the rate of
depolarization revealed by maximal upstroke velocity
(UVMAX) measured from the derivative current changes
over the membrane potential without altering the peak
of APs. Whereas, AP durations (APD50 and APD90) were
prolonged with decrease in the maximal downstroke
velocity (DVMAX). These results suggest that multiple ion
channel mechanisms may be involved in the changes in AP
discharge profiles. Additionally, the EC50 of dobutamine for
UVMAX and APD50, a parameter to represent depolarization
and repolarization function, were estimated differently at
0.151 μM and 0.248 μM, respectively, indicating separate
mechanisms being involved in the corresponding changes.
Intriguingly, the ratio of APD50/APD90 at all concentrations
are nearly one (0.98~0.99), implying that the absolute
effective refractory period (ERP) was lengthened in
parallel along with APD prolongation.

Contribution of ICa on dobutamine-mediated
APD prolongation
According to lengthened APD and slowed
repolarization in the presence of dobutamine, the
modulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel would be one
of potential mechanism. To test this hypothesis, ICa was
recorded from ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from
adult mouse heart before and after dobutamine and the
results showed that neither the current density nor I-V
relationship (Figure 3) were changed by dobutamine,
implying that voltage-gated K+ channels (Ito and IK1) would
be the next target to elucidate.

Effect of dobutamine on voltage-gated Na+
channel activity

Involvement of IK1 and Ito in dobutaminemediated slow repolarization

Upon the effect of dobutamine on the parameters of
AP depolarization including RMP, APFT, and UVMAX, the
changes in current density and/or the voltage-dependent
property of Na+ channel in the presence of dobutamine
are highly expected. In this regard, INa was collected
(Figure  2A & 2B) and averaged data showed that the
INa density was enhanced concentration-dependently

Voltage-gate K+ channels, such as IK1 and Ito, are
dominate currents for AP repolarization in mouse, which
play an opposite role against ICa, and the down-regulation
of IK1 and Ito would also cause increased APD and slowed
repolarization. Surprisingly, the current density and
voltage-dependent property (Figure 4 & 5) for both IK1

(Figure 6A & 6B), strongly indicating the Ca2+-dependency
of dobutamine-mediated changes in AP repolarization.

Extracellular-dependency of dobutaminemediated changes in AP repolarization

Effect of Kb-r7943 on dobutamine-mediated
changes in AP repolarization

Even though, IK1 and Ito, and ICa as well were not
involved in dobutamine-mediated AP repolarization
changes, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization through other
transmembrane mechanism rather than voltage-gated Ca2+
is then expected. To verify if the extracellular Ca2+ influx
occurs during the AP repolarization, removing extracellular
Ca2+ instead of using Mg2+ would be the easiest way. In
another set of experiment, the effect of dobutamine on AP
was repeated in the normal recording solution with 2 mM
Ca2+. Interestingly, the similar results induced by 1 μM
dobutamine were disappeared at ~2 min after complete bath
perfusion (~1 ml/min) with 0 mM Ca2+ recording solution

Recent observation provides an evidence showing
the potential connection between Nav1.5 and Na+-Ca2+
exchanger (NCX) [3, 4], which is a possible clue for
an explanation regarding the effects of dobutamine
AP discharge profiles. To test this hypothesis in our
experimental condition, the APs were elicited in currentclamp configuration in ventricular cardiomyocytes. The
results showed that the AP repolarization changes induced
by 1.0 μM dobutamine were completely blocked by the
pretreatment of cardiomyocyte with 3 μM Kb-r7943
(Figure 6C & 6D), a selective blocker for NCX, without
affecting increased AP depolarization (UVMAX).

DISCUSSION

potential upon a Hodgkin-Huxley model [15–17]. In other
words, the more faster depolarization occurs, the more K+
channels would be recruited during the repolarization and
sequentially causing a shorter AP duration. Interestingly,
although dobutamine caused a fast depolarization the
larger K+ currents recruitment, especially the transient
(Ito), were not observed from the voltage-clamp records,
suggesting other ion channel mechanism being involved in
this event and the most suspicious one is ICa, unfortunately,
this hypothesis was also not confirmed under the current
experimental condition.
Recently, several reports indicate the potential
role of the reverse mode of NCX in an intracellular
Ca2+ mobilization [3, 4], which could be cytoplasmic
Na+-dependent [5] and activated during the AP
depolarization [18] in mouse and human. In this regard,
by preincubation of ventricular cardiomyocytes with
Kb-r7943, a selective NCX blocker, dobutamine-mediated
changes in repolarization were disappeared without
altering the depolarization, which was also confirmed by
simply removing the extracellular Ca2+. Even though the
extracellular Ca2+ was not added in our recording solution,
the concentration for extracellular Ca2+ came from the
distilled water and chemicals would be close to 1 μM
[19], which may be enough to maintain the cell function
and signaling cascades. These data strongly suggest that
dobutamine causes extracellular Ca2+-dependently Na+induced Ca2+ influx through the reverse mode of NCX.
Collectively, in the presence of dobutamine,
unchanged ratio of APD50/APD90 may not increases the
risk for arrhythmogenesis because the effective refractory
period remains no change along with the similar extend
prolongation of both APD50 and APD90. Meanwhile, the
prolonged AP duration would limit heart rate increased
by β1-receptor stimulation, fast depolarization would
produce a fast ventricular contraction and offer a relative
longer period of time for cardiac diastolation. KB-R7943
is a potent, selective inhibitor of the reverse mode of the
Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, but its modulatory effects on other
receptor systems, such as the inhibition of Kb-r7943
on nicotinic receptor [20] and N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor [8] in nervous system, can not be excluded
in cardiomyocytes under the current investigation. It
would be necessary to verify the effect of Kb-r7943 on
β-adrenoreceptor in the future experiment although it has
not been documented so far.

Dobutamine is a sympathomimetics and activates
β-adrenergic receptors (β1 and β2 mediating cardiac and
vascular effects, respectively) as an inodilator [12] and
can be used in cases of congestive heart failure to increase
cardiac output and positive inotropic support in the shortterm treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due
to depressed contractility. Even though the clear beneficial
effect of dobutamine the appropriate role of intravenous
inodilator therapy in the management of congestive heart
failure has long been a subject of controversy and limitation,
mainly because of the side effects such as increased heart
rate and O2 consumption via β-receptor activation [13], and
direct vascular effect and baroreflex feed-back regulation
[14]. So, further investigation is definitely necessary
to elucidate the exist electrophysiological mechanism
underlying the therapeutic effect of dobutamine, which
may in turn benefit for the future clinical application and
pharmacological convention of dobutamine.
The major finding of this observation has
demonstrated, for the first time by our knowledge, that the
extracellular Ca2+-dependent Na+-induced Ca2+ influx is
confirmed in ventricular cardiomyocyte in the presence of
dobutamine in a concentration-dependent manner through
voltage-gated Na+ channel (Nav1.5) activation during AP
depolarization and consequently activation of the reverse
mode of NCX and the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization
during prolonged AP repolarization, which may be a novel
mechanism of positive inotropic action of dobutamine
except for the known β1-receptor activation and G-protein
coupled cAMP pathway.
Clearly, dobutamine accelerates the AP
depolarization with shifting of RMP and AP firing
threshold toward the hyperpolarized direction and this
observation is supported by the notion of increased INa
density presumably due to the enhanced availability
of voltage-gated Na+ channel at given relatively lower
potential upon the inactivation profiles. In this particular
case, a relatively less energy would be required to charge
the membrane and therefore causing the reduction of AP
firing threshold without alternation of voltage-dependent
activation and inactivation properties. However,
dobutamine-induced RMP hyperpolarization might
be explained by the dobutamine-induced myocardial
K+ uptake by β1-adrenoreceptor and adenylate cyclase
activation [13] and the Nernst Equation.
Not surprisingly, the outward K+ currents are the
first to respond to a depolarizing event on account of the
hyperpolarized activation profile and fast activation time
constant for these currents. Moreover, as the membrane
potential enters into a phase of rapid depolarization there
is a marked recruitment of transient and Ca2+-activated
K+ currents, which are primary outward K+ currents
responsible for the terminating the AP upstroke and
initiating a reversal in the trajectory of the membrane
