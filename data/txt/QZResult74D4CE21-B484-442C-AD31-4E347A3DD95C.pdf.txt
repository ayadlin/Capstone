BACKGROUND. In patients with locally advanced and operable breast cancer,
neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been demonstrated to increase the chance of
breast-conserving surgery (BCS) when compared with adjuvant treatment; moreover, patients who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) have a better
outcome. A literature-based meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to
‘weigh’ how much taxanes add to anthracyclines as primary treatment over
standard chemotherapy was conducted.

METHODS. Event-based relative risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were derived through both a fixed-effect and a random-effect model; a
heterogeneity test was applied as well. Absolute differences (AD) and the number
(of patients) needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. Primary endpoints were: 1)
pCR rate and 2) BCS rate. A sensitivity analysis of 3 subgroups according to taxane strategies was conducted.

RESULTS. Data for primary endpoints were available for 7 RCTs (2455 patients).
The rate of BCS was significantly higher for patients receiving taxanes, with an
AD of 3.4% (P 5 .012), which translates into 29 patients NNT, without significant
heterogeneity. The rate of pCR was higher for patients receiving taxanes, although
not statistically significant. In the sensitivity analysis, patients receiving taxanes
as a sequential schedule had a significant higher probability to achieve pCR, with
an AD of 2.4% (P 5 .013), which translates into 41 patients NNT, without significant heterogeneity. Patients receiving taxanes as a concomitant schedule had a
significantly higher probability to achieve BCS, with an AD of 5.3% (P 5 .027),
which translates into 19 patients NNT, without significant heterogeneity. The
complete response rate was significantly higher in the taxane arms, regardless of
the adopted strategy, with an AD ranging from 6.7% to 15.5%.

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of taxanes and anthracyclines as neoadjuvant
chemotherapy for early breast cancer improves the chance of achieving both
higher BCS and pCR rates. Cancer 2008;113:238–46.  2008 American Cancer

n the U.S., breast cancer is the second most frequent cause of
cancer-related death.1 The administration of chemotherapy before
surgery in patients affected by operable or locally advanced breast
cancer has become 1 of the preferred options for such patients in
recent years. Although patients affected by more advanced disease
(ie, ‘locally advanced’) should be encouraged to use such an
approach, to our knowledge there is no shared consensus regarding

the use of primary treatment for patients with ‘operable’ disease.2,3 Moreover, the benefit in survival provided by neoadjuvant chemotherapy is still under
debate, and a recent cumulative analysis has demonstrated that such a strategy, when compared with adjuvant therapy, is able to significantly increase only
the rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS).4 Indeed,
such a finding was reported in what to our knowledge was 1 of the largest trials comparing the same
chemotherapy administered in both strategies.5
Although survival outcomes were the primary
endpoints in many of the reported trials, an intriguing significant correlation between the achievement
of pathologic complete response (pCR) and survival
benefit has been found, opening new scenarios for
clinical trial design using new surrogate endpoints.6–8
Although challenging, many biases come to the surface from the available literature in this particular
field, given the differences in the correct definition of
the pathologic response.2
With regard to the treatment, in patients with
advanced disease, polychemotherapy is able to provide a significant benefit in both the overall response
rate and median time to disease progression when
compared with single-agent chemotherapy.9 Anthracyclines have to be considered the ‘milestone’ drug
for the treatment of breast cancer, regardless of the
combination or setting in which they are administered, and their combination with taxanes (paclitaxel
and docetaxel) has recently been demonstrated to be
1 of the preferred options for patients with both
advanced and early disease, by increasing the time to
disease progression and responses, and both diseasefree and overall survival (DFS and OS), respectively.10–12
Many randomized trials exploring the role of taxanes in the neoadjuvant setting have been conducted
in recent years, with conflicting results and different
adopted strategies, drugs, and schedules; actually,
few of these studies have been fully published.13–18
To our knowledge to date, although the benefit of
taxanes was evident in nearly all trials, the small trial
cohorts (and consequently inadequate statistical
power) in some trials and the mentioned differences
between studies render the quantification of the
magnitude of such an advantage very difficult at the
bedside. Moreover, such a benefit should be balanced with the complexity of administration, toxicity
of the regimen, and economic costs.
To clarify how much the combination of anthracyclines and taxanes improves patient outcome compared with standard treatment, we performed a
meta-analysis of all published or presented randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our comprehensive analysis was conducted after 4
steps: definition of the outcomes (definition of the
question the analysis was designed to answer), definition of the criteria applied for the selection of the
eligible trials, definition of the search strategy, and a
detailed description of the statistical method used.11

Outcome Definition
The combination of any of the commercially available taxanes (ie, paclitaxel or docetaxel) and any of
the standard anthracyclines for early disease (ie, doxorubicin or epirubicin) was considered an experimental arm, whereas any anthracycline combination
was considered the standard comparator arm. Analyses were conducted to verify any significant differences in both primary and secondary outcomes. The
primary outcomes for the magnitude of benefit analysis were the rate of pCR, whatever definition was
adopted by the trialists, and the rate of BCS. The secondary endpoints were the rate of clinical complete
and partial responses (CR and PR), the rate of lymph
node-negative disease after treatment (node-NEG),
the rate of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia according to the
World Health Organization (WHO), and survival outcomes, such as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). A meta-analysis for each endpoint
was calculated only if data were reported in at least
50% of selected RCTs. For all endpoints, 3 subgroups
of interest were identified for examination, helping
to decrease biases and differences between trials
(sensitivity analysis): 1) overall (all eligible RCTs considered); 2) concomitant population (considering
only trials in which taxanes were administered concurrently with anthracyclines); and 3) sequential
(considering only trials in which taxanes were given
sequentially after anthracyclines-based comparator
chemotherapy).
Search Strategy
The deadline for a trial publication and/or presentation to be eligible for this analysis was November
2007. Eventual updates of RCTs were gathered
through the MEDLINE (PubMed; available at
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed), American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO; available at www.asco.org),
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO;
available at www.esmo.org), Federation of European
Cancer Societies (FECS; available at www.fecs.be), or

scanned in the references list to look for missing
trials. Furthermore, lectures of major meetings
(ASCO, ESMO, ECCO, and SABCS) having ‘‘neoadjuvant or primary chemotherapy for breast cancer’’
or ‘‘early breast cancer’’ as topics were checked. No
language restrictions were applied.

Trial Identification Criteria
All randomized trials were gathered, published as
formal articles in peer-reviewed journals, or presented at the ASCO, ECCO, ESMO, or SABCS meetings until October 2007, in which previously
untreated resectable early breast cancer patients
were randomized to receive primary/neoadjuvant
chemotherapy with anthracycline-based either with
sequential or concomitant taxanes (paclitaxel or docetaxel). Given the primary endpoints (pCR and BCS
rate), phase 2 RCTs were also considered eligible,
conversely to meta-analyses examining survival endpoints, which gather only phase 3 trials.11 Trials without taxanes in any treatment arm or with taxanes in
both arms were ruled out, and trials in which taxanes
were given without anthracyclines were considered
to be ineligible.19–21 Trials enrolling ‘unresectable’
stage III patients were excluded, given that surgery
was not performed (no BCS data are available), and
no pCR data were reported.22
Data Extraction
From each arm within each trial the number of
events for primary and secondary endpoints were
obtained. For this assessment, the last trial’s available
update was considered as the original source. When
available, independent/external panel response evaluations were preferred to local investigator determination. All data were reviewed and separately
computed by 4 different independent investigators
(FC, EB, PC, and DG).
Data Synthesis
The log of relative risk ratio (RR) was estimated for
each considered endpoint and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were derived.23 By this method it was
possible to apply a fixed-effect model as well as a
random-effect model according to the inverse variance and the Mantel-Haenszel method. To test for
heterogeneity between trials, the Q statistic was
used. Patients were recorded in the 2 3 2 tables
using the intention-to-treat (ITT) assignment when

clinical trials.

applicable. The significance of the heterogeneity test
suggests a preference for the random-effect estimation for a more appropriate evaluation of the results.
To decrease the risk of overestimation, absolute differences (ADs) for each outcome were calculated according to a formula modified by Parmar and Machin24
(AD 5 exp {RR 3 log[control survival]} 2 control survival), instead of simply calculating the ratios of
events. The number (of patients) needed to treat
(NNT) for a single beneficial patient was determined
(NNT: 1/[(Absolute Benefit)/100]).25 The results are
depicted in all figures as conventional meta-analysis
forest plots. The RRs are to be interpreted as follows:
an RR <1.0 indicates fewer events in the experimental
arm. The meta-analysis calculations were accomplished using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software (version 1.0.23; CMA, Biostat, Englewood, NJ).11

RESULTS
Selected Trials
Eleven potential eligible trials were identified, for a total
of 4411 randomized patients (Fig. 1).7,8,13–18,20–22,26–28
The trial characteristics are listed in Table 1. Of
these, 3 trials were excluded (1639 patients) because
of the absence of anthracyclines in the experimental
arm in combination with taxanes.13,14,20,21 Of the 8
remaining trials from a more detailed evaluation
(2772 patients), 1 study (317 patients) was excluded
because of ‘unresectable’ disease, as defined by trialists (ie, stage IIIA, stage IIIB).22 Finally, 7 RCTs were
gathered for the meta-analysis. The number of enrolled patients for each trial ranged from 30 to 2411.
Five trials adopted the concomitant administration
of anthracyclines and taxanes, whereas 2 used the
sequential approach.15,16,26–28 Docetaxel was administered in 4 RCTs, paclitaxel was administered in 3.

Objective response rates in the control arms ranged
from 50% to 85%, whereas responses in the experimental arm range from 81% to 91% (Table 1). There
were no disagreements between investigators at the
time of data extraction and analysis.

Combined Analysis
All obtained results are displayed in Table 2 (primary
endpoints) and Table 3 (secondary endpoints); primary endpoint plots are depicted in Figures 1 and 2.
Primary endpoints
The numbers of pCRs for each eligible trial were
available. In the overall population (2455 patients; 7
RCTs), the chance to achieve pCR was found to be
higher for patients receiving taxanes, although not

statistically significant (Table 2). In the sensitivity
analysis, patients receiving taxanes as a sequential
schedule (1709 patients, 2 RCTs) had a significantly
higher probability of achieving a pCR, with an RR of
1.73 (95% CI, 1.12–2.68; P 5 .013), without significant
heterogeneity (P 5 .65), with an AD of 2.4%, which
translates into 41 patients NNT (Table 2). The numbers of patients who underwent BCS were available
in 6 of 7 trials (2425 patients). In the overall population, the chance to undergo BCS was found to be significantly higher for patients receiving taxanes, with
an RR of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02–1.21; P 5 .012), without
significant heterogeneity (P 5 .43), with an AD of
3.4%, which translates into 29 patients NNT (Table
2). In the sensitivity analysis, patients receiving taxanes as concomitant schedule (716 patients, 4 RCTs),

had a significant higher probability of achieving BCS,
with an RR of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.02–1.47; P 5 .027),
without significant heterogeneity (P 5 .78), with an
AD of 5.3%, which translates into 19 patients NNT
(Table 2).

Secondary endpoints
The numbers of patients who achieved a CR were
available in 6 of 7 trials (2405 patients). In the overall

population, the chance to achieve a CR was significantly higher for patients receiving taxanes, with an
RR of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.44–1.74; P < .0001), without significant heterogeneity (P 5 .37), with an AD of 14.0%,
which translates into only 7 patients NNT (Table 3).
In the sensitivity analysis, this benefit appears to be
independent of the adopted strategy, with a significant AD of 6.7% (P 5 .013) and 15.5% (P < .0001) for
a concomitant or sequential schedule, respectively

Neoadjuvant Taxanes for Early Breast CA/Cuppone et al.

(Table 3). The chance to achieve PR was not found
to be significant in either the primary or sensitivity
analysis of the random effect model evaluation,
which is required for significant heterogeneity (Table
3). The numbers of patients achieving disappearance
of tumor cells in the axillary lymph nodes (nodeNEG) were available in 4 of 7 trials (2272 patients).
In the overall population, the possibility of achieving
lymph node-NEG status was found to be significantly
higher for patients receiving taxanes, with an RR of
1.13 (95% CI, 1.02-1.21; P 5 .013), without significant
heterogeneity (P 5 .11), with an AD of 3.4%, which
corresponds to 29 NNT (Table 3). In the sensitivity
analysis, patients receiving taxanes on a sequential
schedule (1709 patients, 2 RCTs) had a significant
higher probability of achieving lymph node-NEG status, with an RR of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.02-1.22; P 5 .001),
without significant heterogeneity (P 5 .26), with an
AD of 4.0%, which translates into 25 patients NNT
(Table 3). No significant difference between treatment arms was found for DFS (Table 3). The analysis
for OS and rate of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was not
performed because <50% of the selected RCTs
reported those data.

DISCUSSION
According to the reported results, a significant benefit in pCRs in favor of taxanes appears to be restricted to a sequential strategy (all of which used
docetaxel) (Table 2) (Fig. 2). A trend in favor of taxanes was observed in the overall population as well,
but the contribution of the sequential strategy was
more than evident (Fig. 2). These data are similar to
those observed in 1 of the secondary endpoints (ie,
the absence of tumor cells in axillary lymph nodes)
(Table 3). Even if the AD found between the treatment arms appears to be lower than expected (2.4%),
it should be kept in mind that an appropriate formula to decrease the overestimation because of a literature-based approach was adopted. Indeed, if the
overall numbers of pCR events are simply compared
between treatment arms, the rate is nearly doubled.
In any event, we believe that too many biases
are already present in meta-analyses, and that is why
we prefer to be as careful as possible. Indeed, it
should kept in mind that the results according to the
strategy (sequential or concomitant) are part of a
sensitivity analysis, which was planned just to determine where the main contributors to the overall data
exist; moreover, no direct comparison results in the
neoadjuvant strategy between them were present,
even if the adjuvant comparison (just as a secondary
analysis of a trial with a different main endpoint)

243

appeared to confirm a better outcome for the sequential approach when docetaxel was used.29 Of
note is the finding that the main contributor to the
sequential strategy (and to the overall analysis as
well) is the trial by Bear et al.13,14, which accounted
for 50% of the overall sample, whereas some of the
concomitant approach RCTs were found to have a
significant discrepancy between the planned and the
actually randomized patients (Table 1).
Although impressive, these conclusions in favor
of the mentioned strategy should be softened, given
the discrepancy in trial number, sample size, and
overall patient population when compared with the
concomitant approach (Tables 1 and 2). Moreover,
the different treatment durations across trials can
easily be considered a confounding factor as well.
Furthermore, as already reported, the identification
of ‘what a pCR should be’ in the current literature
(and in the gathered trials) remains a significant issue.
To our knowledge to date, at least 4 classifications of this pathologic finding have been reported,
according to sample harvesting and pathologic
response grading.8,30–33 However, the definitions of
pCR used by each study are not all the same and the
methods and the criteria of assessment are not standardized. According to an international panel of
experts, pCR should be defined as the disappearance
in both the breast and the axilla of all invasive and
noninvasive cancer cells.2,3 In addition, those experts
raised concerns about lymph node-negative disease;
evidence for this ‘special’ subgroup of patients is less
strong than in the whole population, whereas the
number of patients with small tumors and negative
axillary lymph nodes appear to be increasing in
neoadjuvant studies.2,3 However, patients with persistent ductal carcinoma in situ with no residual invasive disease have an excellent prognosis.34
One of the more recent issues revealed by the
use of pCR is its correlation with late primary endpoints such as overall survival benefit. Although
many of the biggest international cooperative trials
found a significant correlation between these 2 endpoints,2 the above-mentioned experts panel did not
state any final recommendation in this regard.2 Actually, the benefit of choosing pCR as a primary endpoint in such studies should accumulate data in a
shorter time-frame and, in the presence of significant
differences, with a smaller patient size. One of the
more recognized underlying hypotheses is the eradication of micrometastatic disease. As a consequence,
the early identification of features that can predict
for response may allow a better selection of patients
who will benefit from this line of therapy and, more
importantly, may spare patients the toxicity of poten-

tially ineffective treatment.5,35,36 Given the recent
advances in targeted agents development and the
enormous strength provided by both companies and
oncologists, the validation and final introduction of a
short-term (surrogate) endpoint such as pCR would
allow sparing resources as well.
The reported series have shown 5-year recurrence rates in patients with a pCR ranging from 13%
to 25%. In such patients, pCR may not be a good
surrogate of OS, and therefore these patients may
not be optimal candidates for clinical trials in which
pCR is the primary endpoint. Finally, such data may
also identify patients who may benefit from additional therapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
These data suggest that premenopausal patients with
advanced local disease and suboptimal axillary
lymph node evaluation may be candidates for clinical trials to determine whether more aggressive or
investigational adjuvant therapy will be of benefit.
Given the fact BCS has been demonstrated to be
the stronger (and perhaps the only) significant
advantage in favor of the neoadjuvant strategy when
compared with the adjuvant stratgey,4,5 we chose to
consider that as 1 of our primary endpoints. A significant advantage in favor of taxanes is observed in the
overall population, whereas the contribution to this
result is mainly because of the concomitant
approach (Fig. 3) (Table 2). This is intriguing because
of the smaller sample size of this population when
compared with the sequential approach. In any case,
2 points deserve to be considered: 1) this result is in
the same direction as the results from the literature
regarding the better activity of the combination of

taxanes and anthracyclines in terms of overall
response,10,37,38 and 2) there is a trend in favor of
taxane in the sequential treatment arm as well. Actually, this last issue hides a strong bias in trial comparison; patients enrolled in the sequential treatment
arm have been randomized after previous anthracyclines, and therefore the early response to the first
treatment is not accounted for in the final response
evaluation. This is the same for every response comparison. In any event, from a clinical practice perspective, this bias reflects the same issue raised at
the outset when a ‘literature summary’ is made at
the patient’s bedside to choose the better treatment
in the present case.
Similar to what is observed in patients with
advanced disease, the concurrent administration of
taxanes increases complete responses, regardless of
strategy, and it is much more evident in the concomitant approach (Table 3). Nevertheless, this translates
in metastatic disease (as well as adjuvant) into a significant worsening of toxicities, although we were
not able to quantify these data given that they were
not exhaustively reported in at least 50% of the considered trials. No conclusions can be drawn regarding survival analysis. The DFS was not found to be
significantly different between treatment arms and,
unfortunately, we did not find enough data regarding
OS. The exploration of the eventual correlation
between pCR, DFS, and OS would have been a strong
point in favor of our review. Moreover, given that the
results obtained with primary chemotherapy can be
considered as a ‘treatment model’ which might mirror those of the adjuvant setting, it would have been

Neoadjuvant Taxanes for Early Breast CA/Cuppone et al.

intriguing to compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant
taxanes with the data from 2 meta-analyses that
demonstrated a 5-year DFS and OS benefit of 4% to
6% and 2% to 3%, respectively.11,12
Although the results of the current study confirm
and quantify the benefit of adding taxanes in the primary chemotherapy for patients with early breast
cancer, a ‘roadmap’ to identify which patients really
benefit from such drugs needs to be drawn. With
this intent, gene and molecular profiling of breast
cancer are playing a greater role in the prognostic
and predictive classification of breast cancer. The
recent evidence indicating that breast cancer patients
overexpressing HER-2 are more likely to respond to
taxanes regardless of the setting39–42 strongly suggests that the definition of a modern ‘prognostic’
platform taking into account both clinical and molecular predictive factors for pathologic response
represents the most significant challenge in the coming years.
