ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) represent a new class of anticancer drugs.
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), the first HDI approved for the treatment
of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), is currently being tested in clinical trials for
other cancers. However, SAHA has been ineffective against solid tumors in many
clinical trials. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms of SAHA resistance
may provide the basis for improved patient selection and the enhancement of clinical
efficacy. Here we demonstrate that oncogenic K-ras contributes to SAHA resistance
by upregulating HDAC6 and c-myc expression. We find that the high levels of HDAC6
expression are associated with activated K-ras mutant in colon cancer patients.
And expressions of HDAC6 and c-myc are increased in fibroblasts transformed with
activated K-ras. Surprisingly, we find that activated K-ras transformed cells are
more resistant to SAHA inhibition on cell growth and anchorage-independent colony
formation. We show that a K-ras inhibitor sensitizes K-ras mutated lung cancer cells
to SAHA induced growth inhibition. We also find that mutant K-ras induces HDAC6
expression by a MAP kinase dependent pathway. Our study suggests that combined
treatment with SAHA and K-ras inhibitors may represent an effective strategy to
overcome SAHA resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Inactivation of HDAC6 decreases c-myc expression,
leading to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.
Consistent with our study, Lee et al. found that HDAC6
is required for efficient oncogene-induced tumorigenesis
in mouse, and that fibroblasts deficient in HDAC6 are
more resistant to both oncogenic Ras and ErbB2-induced
transformation [9]. On the other hand, we also found that
overexpression of HDAC6 leads to increased level of
c-myc, suggesting HDAC6 could play a positive role in
tumorigenesis [8].
HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) represent a promising
new class of anticancer drugs. SAHA (Vorinostat) has
been approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell
lymphoma (CTCL), and it is currently being evaluated
in other cancer types [10].

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of
enzymes that remove acetyl groups from lysine residues.
Besides the well-established role of HDACs in regulating
histone acetylation and gene transcription, recent studies
have revealed that HDACs have diverse functions in a
much broader array of biological processes [1]. The
best example is HDAC6, which has been implicated
in regulation of microtubules, growth factor-induced
chemotaxis, misfolded protein stress response and tumor
invasion [2–7]. Our previous study showed that HDAC6
is involved in EGF-induced β-catenin nuclear localization
and activation of c-myc [8]. HDAC6 deacetylates
β-catenin at lysine 49 and promotes its nuclear import.

Recent studies also show that the combination
of HDIs and alkylating agents exhibit efficient antiproliferative activity on myeloid leukemia cells [11].
HDIs have been shown to induce differentiation, cell cycle
arrest, autophagy and apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell
lines, inhibit tumor growth in animal models, and show
antitumor activity in clinical trials [12, 13]. However,
SAHA has been ineffective against solid tumors in many
clinical trials, including colorectal and non-small cell
lung cancers. Poor response to treatment could be linked
to systemic factors like pharmacokinetics or to tumorspecific factors both at the level of the malignant cell
or the tumor microenvironment [14]. It has been shown
that overexpression of HDAC1 in melanoma cells was
sufficient to confer HDI resistance [15]. An inactivating
mutation in HDAC2 was identified in various human
colon and endometrial cancer cell lines. Treatment of
HDAC2-deficient cells with TSA failed to induce histone
acetylation and inhibit proliferation [16]. HDIs induce
apoptosis in a variety of malignant cells. And it has been
shown that overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 is
sufficient to confer HDIs resistance [17]. Because Bcl-2
overexpression occurs in leukemias and lymphomas, it
is possible that it may play a role in clinical response to
HDIs. Furthermore, the antiapoptotic transcription nuclear
factor κB (NF-κB) has also been identified as a mediator
of resistance to HDI treatment. It has been shown that the
activation of NF-κB by HDIs interferes with their ability
to trigger cell death in non–small cell lung cancer and
leukemia cell lines. And inhibition of NF-κB activation
sensitizes the malignant cells to death in response to
inhibition of HDACs [18].
Activating mutations of K-ras are found in
approximately 30% of human cancers. K-ras is commonly
mutated at codon 12 or 13 [19, 20]. GTP-bound K-ras
converts extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling
cascades underlying diverse cellular activities such as
cell proliferation and survival. The Ras-bound GTP is
then hydrolyzed to GDP, resulting in termination of
signaling. Thus, K-Ras acts as a molecular switch to
regulate the RAF-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-Akt pathways,
and mutations in K-Ras favoring its active, GTP-bound
forms will lead to aberrant intracellular signaling,
resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival
in tumors. Besides its well studied role in tumorigenesis,
Ras activating mutations are also involved in antitumor
drug resistance in lung and colon cancers. It has been
shown that clinical responses to cetuximab, an antiEGFR antibody approved for colon cancer treatment, are
restricted to patients with wild-type K-ras tumors [21].
K-ras mutations are used to predict the lack of clinical
benefit from cetuximab treatment in colon cancer and to
select colon cancer patients for the antibody therapy.
Here we show that oncogenic K-ras contributes to
SAHA resistance. We find that activated K-ras mutants are
associated with the high level of HDAC6 in colon cancer

patients. Our previous study showed that overexpression
of HDAC6 could promote tumor cell growth by activating
oncogene c-myc. Consistently, we find that expressions
of both HDAC6 and c-myc are significantly increased in
fibroblasts transformed with an activated K-ras mutant.
Importantly, we find that K-ras transformed cells are
more resistant to SAHA inhibition on cell growth and
anchorage-independent colony formation. We show that
a K-ras mutant-specific inhibitor sensitizes cancer cells
to SAHA induced growth inhibition. We also show that
K-ras can induce HDAC6 expression by a MAP kinase
dependent pathway, and that SAHA suppresses c-myc
expression and tumor growth in K-ras transformed
cells. Our study demonstrates that K-ras confers SAHA
resistance by upregulating HDAC6 and c-myc expression
and suggests that a combined treatment with SAHA
and K-ras inhibitors may represent a useful strategy to
overcome SAHA resistance induced by oncogenic K-ras.

RESULTS
Association of K-ras mutation and high
expression of HDAC6 in colon cancer patients
Our previous study showed that overexpression of
HDAC6 leads to increased level of c-myc expression,
suggesting HDAC6 could play a positive role in
tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, both human colon
cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues (n = 12) were
collected. Western blotting showed higher expression
of HDAC6 protein in 7 (59%) tumor tissues compared
to controls (Figure 1A), suggesting that HDAC6 may
be involved in human colon cancer development. Since
K-ras is commonly mutated in colorectal carcinoma, we
also analyzed the status of K-ras from the same patient
samples by DNA sequencing. We identified G12D K-ras
mutation in tumor tissues from patient No. 6 and 10. In
patient No. 3, we identified both wild type and G12V
K-ras, suggesting that the mutation is heterozygous or
it is difficult to microdissect pure tumor. To confirm the
K-ras status in patient No.3, we sequenced both strands of
K-ras DNA and confirmed G12V mutation (Figure 1B).
Together, we identified K-ras mutations in 3 of 12
(25%) tumor tissues. Interestingly, all 3 tumor tissues
with activated K-ras mutants showed increased level of
HDAC6, suggesting a positive role of K-ras on HDAC6
expression.

HDAC6 and c-myc expression are induced by
K-ras mutation in fibroblasts
The positive correlation between K-ras mutants
and high level of HDAC6 expression in colon cancer
patients prompted us to test if K-ras mutants induce
HDAC6 expression. To this end, we introduced an
activated K-ras mutant into 10T1/2 fibroblast cells
10065

Oncotarget

and examined HDAC6 protein level. Immunoblotting
showed that HDAC6 was increased in 10T1/2 cells
stably transfected with K-ras G12V mutation (Figure
2A). As expected, phosphorylation of ERK and AKT
were also increased in K-ras transfected cells. To test if
K-ras regulated HDAC6 expression at the transcription
level, we analyzed HDAC6 mRNA level by quantitative
real-time PCR (RT-PCR). As shown in Figure 2B,
HDAC6 mRNA level was increased by > 2 fold in 10T1/2
cells stably expressing K-ras, further supporting a potential
role of HDAC6 in K-ras induced tumorigenesis. Then
we asked if K-ras had the same effect on expression of
other members of HDAC family. As shown in Figure 2C,
we found that the expression levels of other HDACs, such
as HDAC1, HDAC7 and SIRT2, were not affected by
K-ras mutant, suggesting that HDAC6 may be a specific
effector of K-ras.
Since we found that overexpression of HDAC6
promotes β-catenin nuclear translocation and transcription
of its target gene like c-myc, we asked if K-ras induced
HDAC6 expression also enhanced c-myc expression. As
expected, c-myc level was indeed increased in 10T1/2 cells
expressing the K-ras mutant (Figure 2C). To further confirm
that K-ras induced c-myc expression is dependent on
HDAC6, HDAC6 siRNA was introduced into 10T1/2 K-ras

cells and as shown in Figure 2D, HDAC6 siRNA inhibited
c-myc expression in 10T1/2 K-ras cells, suggesting a
positive role for HDAC6 in K-ras induced c-myc expression.

Oncogenic K-ras transformed cells are more
resistant to SAHA induced growth inhibition
The observation that K-ras induces HDAC6
dependent c-myc expression prompted us to test if HDAC
inhibitors could prevent K-ras induced tumorigenesis.
To this end, we examined the effect of SAHA on K-ras
induced tumor cell growth. As shown in Figure 3A
introduction of the K-ras mutant into 10T1/2 cells
promoted cell growth and this K-ras induced cell growth
was inhibited by SAHA treatment. Surprisingly, when we
compared both wild-type and K-ras transformed 10T1/2
cells treated with SAHA, we found that the effect of
SAHA on growth inhibition was partially reversed by
K-ras mutant. To test if apoptosis is induced by SAHA
treatment in cancer cells with K-ras mutant, we examined
the SAHA effect on HCT116, a colon cancer cell line
which has the G13D activating mutation in one of the
K-ras alleles. As shown in Figure 3B, SAHA treatment
increased PARP cleavage, suggesting that SAHA could
induce apoptosis in cancer cells with K-ras mutant.

Next, we assessed anchorage-independent colony
formation to analyze the effect of SAHA in cells with
the K-ras mutant. Since we did not observe any colony
formation in wild-type 10T1/2 cells (data not shown), we
used NIH3T3 cells instead in this assay. To this end, wildtype NIH3T3 cells were transduced with K-ras G12V,
and the effects of SAHA were assessed with respect to
colony formation. Consistently, we found that HDAC6
and c-myc protein levels were increased in NIH3T3 cells
stably transfected with K-ras mutant, although the basal
level of HDAC6 expression was increased in wild-type
NIH3T3 cells relative to 10T1/2 MEF cells (Figure 3C).
SAHA treatment of wild-type NIH3T3 cells resulted in
the inhibition on colony formation (Figure 3D and 3E).
In contrast, when we treated NIH3T3 K-ras cells with
SAHA, more colonies were formed than SAHA treated
wild-type NIH3T3 cells. Together, these results show
that cells with K-ras mutant are more resistant to SAHA
induced growth inhibition.

was developed to target the G12C mutant [22]. As shown
in Figure 4A, both SAHA and K-ras C12 treatment resulted
in ~30% and ~20% decrease in cell number, whereas the
combination of SAHA and K-ras C12 for 24 h reduced
cell number by ~70%, suggesting that treatment of K-ras
C12 sensitizes cells to SAHA induced growth inhibition.
Consistent with previous work, c-myc expression was
inhibited by SAHA in Calu-1 cells (Figure 4B). More
importantly, although K-ras inhibitor K-ras C12 alone had
no effect on the protein level of c-myc, treatment of Calu-1
cells with both SAHA and K-ras C12 gave additive effect
on inhibition of c-myc expression (Figure 4B). These
results indicate that inhibition of K-ras activity can further
enhance the sensitivity of Calu-1 to SAHA.

K-ras induces HDAC6 and c-myc expression
through a MAPK dependent pathway
How does K-ras regulate HDAC6 and c-myc
expression? It is well known that K-ras acts as a molecular
switch to regulate the RAF-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-Akt
signaling pathways. Therefore, we asked whether the
MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways regulate HDAC6 and
c-myc expression. 10T1/2 K-ras cells were treated with
inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002), MAPK (U0126) and
SAHA. As shown in Figure 5A, HDAC6 expression was
inhibited by U0126, suggesting that the MAPK pathway
is involved in K-ras induced HDAC6 expression. We
further compared the effect of SAHA and U0126 on
colony formation in HCT116, which has a k-ras activating

Inhibition of K-ras sensitizes cancer cells to
SAHA treatment
We then asked whether the inhibition of K-ras
activity enhances the growth inhibitory effects of SAHA.
To test this, we examined the effect of SAHA and a K-ras
inhibitor on growth inhibition of Calu-1 cells. Calu-1
is a lung cancer cell line that contains a K-ras G12C
activating mutation. And an irreversible, mutant-specific

mutation. As shown in Figure 5B, both SAHA and U0126
exhibited similar effects on colony formation inhibition,
and the combination of SAHA and U0126 gave the
additive effect, suggesting that MAPK could also activate
a HDAC6 independent pathway to promote cell growth in
K-ras mutant cancer cells. Curiously, although the PI3K
inhibitor had no effect on HDAC6 expression, it blocked
c-myc expression (Figure 5A), suggesting that K-ras
induced c-myc expression could be regulated by HDAC6
and PI3K pathways independently, or that both HDAC6
and PI3K contribute to c-myc induction and therefore
tumor cell growth. To distinguish between these two
possibilities, we examined the effect of SAHA and PI3K
inhibition on tumor cell growth using a xenograft model.
Both 10T1/2 and 10T1/2 K-ras cells were inoculated s.c
into nude mice and tumor growth was measured over
time. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, control 10T1/2
cells did not form palpable tumors (0/5), whereas 10T1/2
K-ras cells developed rapidly growing tumors in nude
mice. Most of tumors derived from 10T1/2 k-ras cells

reached a size of 0.5 cm3 within 2 weeks of injection.
Both SAHA and LY294002 treatment reduced the tumor
sizes. The combination of SAHA and LY294002 yielded
no enhanced inhibition of tumor growth, suggesting that
HDAC6 and PI3K contribute to the same pathway, which
leads to c-myc expression and tumor growth.
Based on these finding, we propose a model
whereby oncogenic K-ras could confer SAHA resistance
by upregulating HDAC6 expression through the MAPK
signaling, resulting in activation of the downstream
oncogene c-myc (Figure 5E). Furthermore, the PI3K
pathway also contributes to K-ras induced c-myc expression
and tumor growth. Therefore, a positive association
between K-ras mutation and elevated HDAC6 and c-myc
expression is presumably involved in SAHA resistance.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we find that HDAC6 protein level
is significant increased in 7 of 12 (59%) tumor tissues

compared to controls in colon cancer patients. We also
find that the activated K-ras mutants are associated with
high levels of HDAC6 expression in these patients. We
demonstrate that both HDAC6 and c-myc are induced by
an activated K-ras mutant and inhibition of HDAC6, either
by HDAC6 siRNA or SAHA, blocks K-ras induced c-myc
expression and tumor growth. However, it is unclear
what causes HDAC6 up-regulation in other colon cancer
patients without K-ras activating mutations. Elevated
levels of HDAC6 have also been reported in acute myeloid
leukemia and some breast cancers [23–25]. In breast
cancer cell lines, HDAC6 was shown to be regulated
by estrogen [24]. Interestingly, breast cancer patients
with high level of HDAC6 had a favorable response to
anti-estrogen tamoxifen treatment, suggesting a role of
HDAC6 in estrogen-induced tumorigenesis [25].
Most importantly, our study showed that K-ras
transformed cells are more resistant to SAHA treatment.
Because of its promising results in the treatment of CTCL,
SAHA has been tested in many clinical trials to assess its
efficacy against different solid tumors, including colorectal
and non-small cell lung cancers. Disappointingly, SAHA
has not been effective in clinical trials involving those
solid tumors. Since K-ras mutations are especially
prevalent in colorectal carcinoma (40–45% of cases)
and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (16–40%),
our study suggests that testing for K-ras mutations could
be very important for patient selection in the future
clinical trials of SAHA treatment. In support of this idea,
we find that inhibition of K-ras activity enhances cell
growth inhibition by SAHA, suggesting a combinational
treatment with SAHA and K-ras inhibitor may confer
additional clinical benefit.
