ABSTRACT
Acephalic spermatozoa is a very rare disorder of male infertility. Here, in a
patient from from a consanguineous family, we have identified, by whole-exome
sequencing, a homozygous mutation (c.G2783A, p.G928D) in the BRDT gene. The
gene product, BRDT, is a testis-specific protein that is considered an important drug
target for male contraception. The G928D mutation is in the P-TEFb binding domain,
which mediates the interaction with transcription elongation factor and might affect
the transcriptional activities of downstream genes. By RNA-sequencing analysis of
cells expressing the BRDT mutation, we found the p.G928D mutation protein causes
mis-regulation of 899 genes compared with BRDT wild-type cells. Furthermore, by
Gene Ontology analysis, the upregulated genes in p.G928D cells were enriched in
the processes of intracellular transport, RNA splicing, cell cycle and DNA metabolic
process, revealing the underlying mechanism of the pathology that leads to acephalic
spermatozoa.

round spermatids, elongated sperm and mature sperm in
humans [11, 12]. In the mouse, Brdt deficiency of the first
bromo domain caused infertility, with low sperm number
and reduced sperm motility, malformed heads and tails
[13, 14]. Transcriptional analysis of Brdt knock-out mice
revealed that Brdt could activate expression of 1872 testisspecific genes, and at the same time inhibit expression of
1155 genes [15]. Thus the function of BRDT is correlated
with transcription and chromatin remodeling [16–18]. Based
on the properties of this protein, BRDT was considered as
an important drug target for male contraception [19]. One
study found that single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
rs3088232 in BRDT was associated with male infertility
among Albanians and Macedonians [20]. However, another
study that consisted of 276 azoospermic and 182 fertile men
of Arab and Jewish descent, demonstrated no association
between BRDT rs3088232 and infertility [21]. Another
Chinese group analyzed 361 men with non-obstructive
azoospermia (NOA) and 368 fertile controls, and they

INTRODUCTION
Acephalic spermatozoa (Human Phenotype
Ontology, HP:0012869), also known as decapitated
or pinhead sperm, is one extremely rare type of
oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) in male infertility,
and is defined as spermatozoa without heads in the
ejaculates [1]. There have been very few reports of
this disorder [2–5]. The uniform pattern of acephalic
spermatozoa suggests that the phenotype has a genetic
origin [6]. However, the molecular mechanism of this
disorder was unclear and, recently, one study firstly
reported that biallelic SUN5 mutations caused acephalic
spermatozoa in 47.06% of affected individuals [7].
The BRDT protein contains two bromo-domains,
which are conserved domains involved in the recognition
of H4 acetylated residues in histones [8–10]. The BRDT
gene is testis-specific: it is expressed in spermatocytes,

could not find any BRDT  variants associated with NOA
susceptibility [22]. Thus, the association of BRDT with male
infertility is inconclusive.
Here, we report a patient with acephalic spermatozoa
in a consanguineous family. By whole-exome sequencing
(WES), we found the patient inherited a homozygous
missense mutation in BRDT. Using transcriptional
analysis, we demonstrated that this mutation resulted in
mis-regulation of expression of 899 genes compared with
wild-type BRDT. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the
899 genes suggested a potential underlying mechanism of
the disease pathology. This is the second study to report a
genetic alteration that causes acephalic spermatozoa.

[23, 24]. The glycine located at amino acid 928 in human
BRDT is 100% conserved between different species from
human to zebrafish (Figure 1E), indicating the functional
importance of the G928 site. Thus we hypothesized that
the G928D mutation might affect the transcriptional
activities of BRDT. To test this hypothesis, we introduced
the G928D-encoding mutation into BRDT and expressed
wild-type (WT) BRDT and the G928D mutant in 293FT
cells, respectively. Western blot analysis demonstrated
that the expression level of the G928D mutant was similar
to the WT BRDT protein (Supplementary Figure 1A),
which suggested that the G928D mutation did not affect
the steady state of BRDT protein.

RESULTS

Whole-exome sequencing analysis of a patient
with acephalic spermatozoa

We next wanted to examine whether gene expression
was affected by the G928D mutation. NTERA-2, a
male teratocarcinoma cell line, was transduced with
lentiviral overexpression vectors carrying GFP (negative
control), WT BRDT or G928D BRDT. The BRDT
mRNA expression level was similar between G928D
and WT cells (Supplementary Figure 1B). We examined
the expression of NPC1, OAZ3, PPP1CC, SPATA6 and
STK36 by quantitative real time PCR (q-PCR). These
genes’ were chosen as mice deficient for these genes
exhibited acephalic spermatozoa. However, there was no
significant difference in the expression level of any these
genes between WT and G928D cells (Supplementary
Figure 1C). Thus, transcriptome analysis was employed to
examine the genome-wide expression profiles in G928D
and WT cells. By principal component analysis (PCA)
of RNA-sequencing data, we found that WT and G928D
were similar to each other, but different from control cells
in PC1 (Figure 2A). However, G928D cells were markedly
different from WT BRDT cells in PC2 (Figure 2A).
Hierarchical clustering analysis also demonstrated that
the expression of genes’ in G928D cells was different than
that in WT BRDT cells (Figure 2B). Furthermore, 899
genes were found to be significantly differently expressed
(FDR<0.01) between WT BRDT and G928D cells (Figure
3A). By GO analysis, we found some biological processes,
for example RNA splicing, cell cycle, RNA transport,
DNA metabolic process and intracellular transport, were
enriched in the genes up-regulated in G928D cells (Figure
3B). Only one biological process, translational elongation,
was enriched in the genes down-regulated in G928D
cells (Figure 3B). This alteration in expression of a wide
range of genes might be associated with the pathology of
acephalic spermatozoa.

A patient with acephalic spermatozoa (Figure 1A
and 1B) was recruited to this study. Electron microscopy
showed that the acephalic spermatozoa did not contain any
mitochondria (Figure 1B). Pedigree analysis suggested an
autosomal recessive mode of inheritance associated with
acephalic spermatozoa (Figure 1C). Thus, we focused on
homozygous mutations identified in the patient by wholeexome sequencing. After filtering out polymorphisms
with allele frequency greater than 1% in the dbSNP,
1000Genomes, ESP6500 and/or our inhouse database, we
compiles a list of genes harboring homozygous mutations
(Supplementary Table 1). Among these genes, only
BRDT exhibited testis-specific expression, therefore,
we hypothesized that the homozygous mutation in
BRDT gene was associated with acephalic spermatozoa.
By means of Sanger sequencing, the homozygous
mutation in BRDT (NM_207189:exon19:c.G2783A:p.
G928D), was confirmed in the patient (Figure 1C). This
information has been deposited in the online human
variation database LOVD3: http://databases.lovd.nl/
shared/variants/0000116019#00024141. The patient’s
father, mother and elder unaffected brother all carried a
heterozygous mutation in BRDT (Figure 1C).

In silico analysis of the p.G928D mutation
In silico analysis predicted that the BRDT p.G928D
mutation (abbreviated as G928D) is most probably a
disease-associated mutation (Table 1). The allele frequency
of c.G2783A in the East Asian population was only
0.0001 in the ExAC database (http://exac.broadinstitute.
org/), which is consistent with the extreme rarity of
acephalic spermatozoa. G928D is located in the P-TEFb
binding domain in the C-terminal of the BRDT protein
(Figure 1D). The P-TEFb binding domain mediates the
interaction with transcription elongation factor and might
affect the transcriptional activities of downstream genes

(Figure 1C). By functional analysis of the mutation, we
found 899 genes were differentially expressed between
G928D and WT BRDT cells (Figure 3A). GO analysis
also showed that genes related with RNA splicing, cell
cycle, RNA transport, DNA metabolic process and
intracellular transport were up-regulated in G928D
cells (Figure 3B). This GO result was consistent with a
previously reported gene expression profile observed in
the sperm of asthenozoospermic patients [25]. Therefore,

In 1984, Bacetti et al., found the malformation of
acephalic spermatozoa was due to an overproduction
of vesicles by the Golgi complex in the region between
the centrioles and nucleus [3]. In our study, we found
intracellular transport related genes were up-regulated
in G928D cells, especially some genes involved in the

endosome to trans-Golgi network process, such as VPS54,
GOPC, EEA1, KIF5B and ARL1. So we proposed that
up-regulation of these genes might be associated with the
overproduction of Golgi complex, which might affect the
attachment of the proximal centrioles to the nucleus [1],
and might thereby influence the formation of head-neck
attachment [1]. To our surprise, the knock-out mice of
genes VPS54 or GOPC presented with globozoospermia
[26, 27], another type of sperm head abnormality,
indicating a relationship in pathology between the
acephalic spermatozoa and globozoospermia [6].
In our functional study, the G928D mutation was
found to change the gene expression profile induced by
BRDT. G928D is located in the P-TEFb binding domain
in the C-terminal of the BRDT protein (Figure 1D) and
the G928 site was highly conserved (Figure 1E). Previous
studies have found that the P-TEFb binding domain
mediates the interaction with transcription elongation
factor and might affect the transcriptional activities of
downstream genes [23, 24]. Additionally, expression
of a C-terminal tagged Brdt in mice resulted in a severe
infertility phenotype [15]. Therefore, the G928D mutation
might affect the ability of the C-terminal of the BRDT
protein to recruit P-TEFb complex to the acetylated
chromatin [15, 23], and change the transcriptional
activities of the BRDT protein. Further studies need to
validate whether the interaction between BRDT and the
P-TEFb complex was enhanced or attenuated by the
G928D mutation.
Although a recessive mode of inheritance is
commonly associated with loss-of-function, our genome
wide gene expression analysis suggested that the G928D
mutation resulted in a gain-of-function; therefore we can
categorize it as a recessive gain-of-function mutation.
The recessive gain-of-function, though rare, has been
reported previously in acute myeloid leukemia [28] and in
the genetics of Arabidopsis [29] (http://openscholarship.
wustl.edu/vol9_iss1/114). In the transcriptional analysis
of the G928D mutation, the level of gene expression
up-regulation by the mutant was not very high (1.5 fold
change), so we propose that the effect of one mutant allele
does not reach a threshold level required to bring about the
disease phenotype, whereas two mutant alleles can reach
the threshold level and result in acephalic spermatozoa.
The pathogenic effect related with threshold level in the
recessive gain-of-function is similar to the threshold level
in haploinsufficiency [30], the only difference is that
the former is gain-of-function while the latter is loss-offunction. The genetic mode of recessive gain-of-function
has also been proposed by Bob Horvitz in the analysis
of lin-1 “Vul/Let” alleles in worm genetics (http://www.
wormbook.org/wli/wbg13.3p101/).
Taken together, our study demonstrated for the first
time a homozygous mutation p.G928D of the BRDT gene,
which exerted a significant effect on the gene expression
profile and might lead to acephalic spermatozoa by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

affecting the processes of RNA splicing, cell cycle,
DNA metabolic process and intracellular transport. This
finding provides researchers and clinicians with a better
understanding of the pathology and molecular mechanism
of acephalic spermatozoa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The acephalic spermatozoa patient was recruited
from Xiamen Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital.
Acephalic spermatozoa syndrome is diagnosed if the
patient’s ejaculate contains mostly sperm flagella
without heads. This patient was infertile and had 99.5%
acephalic spermatozoa, with 7.6×106/mL sperm density
and 0.5% sperm motility. The acephalic spermatozoa did
not contain any mitochondria by electron microscopy.
The chromosomal karyotype of the patient was
normal 46; XY, and no deletion was found in the Y
chromosome. The hormones levels of the patient were
normal as follows: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),
3.65 mIU/mL; luteinizing hormone (LH), 2.16 mIU/
mL; testosterone (T), 5.01 ng/mL; estradiol (E2), 46 pg/
mL; prolactin (PRL), 4.98 ng/mL. The patient’s brother
was fertile. This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of National Research Institute for Family
Planning. Written informed consent was obtained and
then 5 ml of peripheral blood was collected from each
participant.

Exome sequencing
Exome sequencing was carried out as previously
described [31]. Variants fulfilling the following criteria
were retained for subsequent analyses: (i) missense,
nonsense, frame-shift or splice site variants; (ii) absent or
rare (frequency < 1%) in dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/snp/), 1000 Genomes (http://browser.1000genomes.
org/index.html), Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC,
http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) and in-house database.

Vectors construction
The full-length human BRDT coding sequence
(2844 base pairs, NCBI transcript ID NM_207189) was
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from
a commercial plasmid (ORIGENE, RC222276) using
specific primers. BRDT wild-type (WT) and c.G2783A
(p.G928D) alleles were subcloned into pENTR-DTOPO plasmid. Overlapping PCR was used to generate
the p.G928D mutation described in this paper. Then the
BRDT wild-type and p.G928D mutation sequence were
recombined into p2k7 [32] vector using Gateway® LR
Clonase® II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) to create
a lentivirus vector as we previously described [33]. The

reads were aligned to the human hg19 reference using
Tophat (v2.0.12) with default settings [36]. Unique mapped
reads mapped on each gene were counted using Htseq
[37], and this was further used to quantify transcription
levels (RPKM, reads per kilobase of transcript per million
mapped reads) using the formula: RPKM=read × 109 /
(gene length × total reads). To assess the cell populations
of all the RNA-Seq samples, the Pearson coefficients
were computed using all genes expressed in more than
two samples, and hierarchical clustering was performed
using the hclust function, and “ward.D2” method in R.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed
using the same criterion with the prcomp function in R.
Differential gene expression analysis was performed by
using R Bioconductor, DESeq2 package, as previously
described [38]. This procedure was based on a negative
binomial distribution. Raw read counts were employed to
build this model, and the false-discovery rate (FDR) was
used to correct for multiple testing errors. Only the genes
with significant p-values and FDR less than 0.01 were
considered to be differentially expressed. The results for
differentially-expressed genes were further presented using
the matplotlib package in python. Gene ontology analysis
was carried out using DAVID functional annotation
bioinformatics microarray analysis (https://david.ncifcrf.
gov/). The RPKM value of all genes in these 6 samples has
been deposited in an Excel file in Supplementary Table 4.

Cell culture and plasmid transfection
293FT cells and NTERA-2 cells were cultured and
passaged as previously described [34, 35]. 293FT cells
were seeded on 6-well plates at a 30% cell confluency
and transfected with 500 ng/well p2k7-BRDT wild-type,
p.G928D variant or GFP plasmids using Lipofectamine
2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. p2k7-GFP plasmid is the
negative control plasmid used in this study. Cells were
cultured for approximately two days after transfection and
then used in further experiments described below.

Western blot analysis and real time quantitative
PCR
Western blot analysis and real time quantitative
PCR were performed as previously described [33]. The
specific antibodies used in Western blot analysis are listed
in Supplementary Table 3. Real time quantitative PCR
primers for all gene sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table 2. The statistical significance of the data was
calculated using One-way ANOVA and Prism 5.0
software.

[33]. For the infection of NTERA-2 cells, the filtered
lentivirus-containing supernatant was added onto the
NTERA-2 cells, which were at 30 % confluence. After
6 hrs, NTERA-2 cell medium was added. One day after
infection, blasticidin (Bsd, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)
was added to the culture medium of NTERA-2 cells. Bsd
