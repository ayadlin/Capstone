BACKGROUND: UFT, a combination of uracil and ftorafur, was developed to combine the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with convenient oral dosing. Leucovorin is combined with UFT to further potentiate the effect of 5-FU
on tumor cells. Orally administered UFT and leucovorin provide higher peak plasma concentrations of 5-FU and prolonged therapeutic 5-FU concentrations compared with continuous infusion of 5-FU. METHODS: Ninety-four patients
with metastatic breast cancer who had been previously treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes were treated with
UFT and leucovorin, given orally, for the first 28 days of a 35-day cycle. The total daily dose of UFT was 300 mg/m2,
which was given in 2 divided doses every 12 hours. The primary endpoint was time to disease progression (TTP). Secondary objectives included overall tumor response rate (OR ¼ complete response [CR] þ partial response [PR]) and
overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 94 patients enrolled, 68 were evaluable for efficacy. Although no CRs were
observed, 9 patients achieved PRs, for an OR of 13.2% in the evaluable population. The median TTP for the evaluable
population was 10.3 weeks, and the proportion of patients free of disease progression at 6 months was 17%. The median OS was 61.6 weeks for all patients enrolled. The most common drug-related  grade 3 adverse events (graded
using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2) were diarrhea, asthenia, nausea, and dehydration. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of UFT and leucovorin administered orally in a twice-daily regimen was found
to have modest activity. Grade 3 toxicities were manageable with appropriate dose adjustments in patients with metC 2010 Ameriastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes. Cancer 2010;116:2301–6. V

To the best of our knowledge, the optimal regimen for treating metastatic breast cancer has not yet been determined.
Thus, novel compounds and various combinations of both investigational and approved therapeutic agents are being
tested in clinical studies. Among the new therapies being explored is an oral combination therapy of UFT (uracil and ftorafur [FT]; Taiho Pharmaceutical Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; BMS-200604; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) and
leucovorin.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is frequently used to treat metastatic breast cancer and colorectal cancer. 5-FU is rapidly
metabolized by the liver. Its mean plasma half-life when given as an intravenous (iv) infusion in humans is 16 minutes.1
Results of a meta-analysis of randomized clinical studies in patients with advanced colorectal cancer that compared 5-FU
bolus with 5-FU as a continuous infusion demonstrated that continuous infusion was superior in terms of tumor response

(14% for bolus vs 22% for continuous infusion) and median survival time (11.3 months for bolus vs 12.1 months
for continuous infusion).2 The primary side effects
observed with 5-FU therapy were gastrointestinal, myelotoxic, or dermatologic (hand-foot syndrome).3 When 5FU was administered iv, the most frequently reported gastrointestinal side effects were oral mucositis and potentially severe diarrhea.4 Attempts to reduce side effects
while maintaining the antitumor effects of 5-FU led to
the development of FT and, ultimately, of UFT.
FT, also known as tegafur, is a fluorinated pyrimidine that has efficacy similar to that of 5-FU.5 Development of an injectable formulation of FT in the United
States was discontinued in the 1980s due to its neurotoxicity when given at doses of 1 to 3 g. FT was subsequently
developed as an oral formulation in Japan, where it is used
as adjuvant therapy for gastrointestinal, head and neck,
breast, and lung cancers. The 5-FU released when FT is
metabolized is itself metabolized by the same pathway as
iv 5-FU and therefore has the same cytotoxic mechanism.
UFT, a combination of uracil and FT in a 4:1 M
ratio, was developed in Japan to combine the cytotoxic
effects of 5-FU with the convenience of oral dosing. Uracil is also metabolized by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and competes with 5-FU for the enzyme when the 2
are coadministered,6 resulting in a significantly prolonged
half-life for 5-FU.
Leucovorin (folinic acid), is a tetrahydrofolic acid
derivative that can enhance the therapeutic and toxic
effects of fluoropyrimidines such as 5-FU.1 It is combined
with UFT to further potentiate the effect of 5-FU on tumor cells.
Preclinical studies using combination therapy of
orally administered UFT and leucovorin revealed that
UFT provides higher peak plasma concentrations of 5-FU
and prolonged therapeutic 5-FU concentrations compared with the continuous infusion of 5-FU. In addition,
the combination may reduce the toxic effects on normal
tissue observed with the administration of 5-FU or FT
alone.
The oral combination therapy of UFT and leucovorin was initially developed in the United States for the
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The efficacy and
safety profiles of the combination have been examined in
several phase 2 and phase 3 studies, which either used
UFT and leucovorin alone or compared the combination
with 5-FU and leucovorin.7-15 The phase 2 studies
focused primarily on response rates and toxicity evaluation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Overall

2302

response rates ranged from 16.9% to 42%. Toxicity was
generally less severe than that noted when 5-FU was used
singly or in combination with leucovorin; the absence of
hand-foot syndrome was most notable.7-11
The phase 3 studies compared the oral UFT and leucovorin combination with iv 5-FU and leucovorin.13-15 A
dose of 300 mg/m2/day of UFT with 25 to 30 mg of leucovorin given 3 times daily (3 times a day of leucovorin
for 28 days, repeated every 35 days) was the most common regimen for these metastatic colorectal cancer studies. Results from 1 study indicated that patients who
received the oral combination experienced less diarrhea
and mucositis, with minimal need for dose interruption
or reduction, compared with patients who received iv 5FU and leucovorin.13
5-FU has been used with leucovorin as second-line
therapy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. FT,
with and without leucovorin, has been explored as an oral,
less-toxic alternative to 5-FU. In a phase 2 study of
patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer,
25 patients received 750 mg/m2/day of FT with 45 mg/
day of leucovorin for 21 days, repeated every 28 days.16
An overall response rate of 32% was observed, and 48%
of patients experienced disease stabilization (median duration, 6 months). The median time to disease progression
(TTP) was 9 months. The results of this study were striking considering the patients’ advanced conditions and
number of previous chemotherapy regimens. The most
common grade 3 toxicities observed were mucositis (24%
of patients) and diarrhea (12% of patients).
In the current study, UFT was divided into 2 daily
doses, each administered with 30 mg of leucovorin during
the first 28 days of a 35-day cycle. The effectiveness of
combining UFT with leucovorin in a twice–daily regimen
was examined in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Eligible patients who had histologically confirmed breast
cancer with metastases and had received prior chemotherapy with anthracyclines and/or taxanes as adjuvant treatment, neoadjuvant treatment, or as treatment for
metastatic disease were eligible. Treatment with at least 1,
but not more than 2, regimens of prior chemotherapy
for metastatic disease was required. Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status had to be
2. Patients who demonstrated no evidence of disease
progression since their last treatment regimen were

excluded, as were patients who had received prior treatment with UFT, capecitabine, ethynyl uracil, or low-dose
continuous infusion 5-FU. The patient must have had
adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function. Before
the initiation of the study, the protocol was approved by
an Institutional Review Board and, for each patient, written informed consent was obtained and documented by
the appropriate signatures.
Treatment
Patients were given 300 mg/m2/day of UFT, divided into
2 doses and administered orally every 12 hours. A 30-mg
dose of leucovorin was given with each dose of UFT.
Patients received study medication for the first 28 days of
each 35-day cycle. If toxicity occurred, the UFT dose was
decreased in increments of 50 mg/m2/day. Once the UFT
dose level was decreased, it was not to be increased. If a
patient required a dose reduction that brought her dose to
below 200 mg/m2/day, she was removed from the study.
The dose of leucovorin was not modified unless the
UFT dose was actually withheld, in which case the leucovorin was also withheld. If the UFT dose was withheld due
to toxicity, the patient resumed treatment once the
adverse effects resolved. If the patient did not fulfill
retreatment criteria within 2 weeks, she was removed
from the study. For patients remaining in the study, treatment was continued until disease progression occurred or
intolerable toxicities developed.
It should be noted that if study medication was
withheld due to toxicity, the days it was withheld were
counted as treatment days. Therefore, the administration
of study medication did not extend beyond Day 28.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was TTP from the on-study date.
Patients who had no disease progression were censored at
their off-study date. Planned secondary endpoints were
overall tumor response rate (OR), overall survival (OS),
and toxicity.
Disease was categorized as measurable, evaluable, or
nonevaluable. Measurable disease response criteria were
defined as follows. A complete response (CR) was considered to be the complete disappearance of all tumor lesions
for at least 4 weeks from the date of documentation of
CR. A partial response (PR) was indicated by a decrease
by >50% in the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular dimensions of all measurable lesions, as determined by 2 consecutive observations at least 4 weeks
apart. No lesions, measurable or not, should have pro-

gressed, and no new lesions should have appeared. Stable
disease (SD) was considered to be a failure to observe
remissions as defined above, in the absence of any progressive or new lesions, as determined by 2 consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart. Progressive disease (PD)
was considered to be an increase of 25% in the size of
any measurable or evaluable lesion, and/or the appearance
of any new lesions or the occurrence of malignant pleural
effusion or ascites.
Evaluable disease response criteria were defined as
follows. A CR was considered to be the complete disappearance of all known disease for at least 4 weeks (for
bone lesions, complete recalcification of lytic lesions or
normalization of a bone scan for blastic lesions and normalization of tumor markers, if previously abnormal). A
PR was an estimated decrease in tumor size of 50% for
at least 4 weeks (for bone lesions, substantial recalcification of lytic lesions). SD was indicated by no significant
change in disease status for at least 4 weeks, including
unchanged disease, estimated decrease of <50%, and
lesions with an estimated increase of <25%. PD was considered to be the appearance of any new lesion not previously identified, or an estimated increase of 25% in
existing lesions. Death secondary to malignant disease was
documented as PD.
Response Evaluations
Tumor response was evaluated every 2 cycles, and the
evaluations were continued until disease progression.
Patients who were removed from the study before the first
tumor response assessment were not considered evaluable
for response unless there was clear evidence of clinical disease progression. All suspected responses were documented with a repeat measurement at 4 weeks.
Statistical Analyses
A total of 81 eligible patients were needed to demonstrate
that a 6-month progression-free survival proportion of
30% had a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) between
20% and 40%. A total of 90 patients were planned. The
95% CIs were calculated for rates of 6-month progression-free survival and overall response. The Kaplan-Meier
estimator was used to examine overall TTP and survival.
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to
relate TTP with patient age, ECOG performance status,
estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, diseasefree interval, presence of visceral metastases, presence of
bone metastases, number of prior chemotherapy regimens, and prior hormone therapy.

RESULTS
Between March 1999 and January 2002, 94 patients (93
females and 1 male) were enrolled at 18 sites. The median
age of the patients was 54.5 years. All 94 patients received
study medications and were evaluable for safety. Patient
baseline characteristics, including ECOG performance
status, prior therapy, and sites of metastases, are summarized in Table 1. Sixty-three patients (67.0%) had prior
hormonal therapy, 62 patients (66%) received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, and 34 patients (36.2%) had received
prior metastatic chemotherapy (34 with 1 prior regimen,
43 with 2 prior regimens, and 15 with 3 prior regimens). Two patients did not receive prior chemotherapy
for metastatic disease and were therefore considered
ineligible.

2304

Fifty patients (53.2%) had visceral metastases and
48 (51.1%) had bone metastases. Fifty patients (53.2%)
had ER-positive tumors, 39 (41.5%) had ER-negative
tumors, and 5 (5.3%) had unknown ER status.
The metastatic disease-free interval (calculated from
the time of initial diagnosis to recognition of metastatic
disease) was 12 months for 76 patients (80.9%),
between 6 and 12 months for 5 patients (5.3%), and <6
months for 13 patients (13.8%).
Two populations were analyzed for efficacy: the eligible population and the efficacy-evaluable population.
The eligible population included all patients who received
at least 1 dose of study medication and was used for the
safety and tolerability analysis. The eligible population
excluded 7 patients: 3 had no measurable or evaluable disease, 2 had received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (rather than chemotherapy to treat metastatic
disease), 1 had exceeded the 2 allowable prior chemotherapy treatments for metastatic disease, and 1 did not have
prestudy blood chemistries obtained. The efficacy-evaluable population (n ¼ 68 patients) also excluded an additional 16 patients who did not have a tumor assessment
after receiving at least 2 cycles of therapy. Only the evaluable population will be discussed in this document.

Summary of Drug Administration
A total of 312 cycles of therapy were administered; the
mean was 3.3 cycles. The average number of treatment
days per cycle was 24.9, and the average dose administered
per day was 277.6 mg/m2. All patients began treatment at
the same dose level: 300 mg/m2/day of UFT with 60 mg/
day of leucovorin, each divided into 2 oral doses.

Dose Modifications
Dose reductions were required for 15 patients (16%),
most frequently for grade 2 or grade 3 diarrhea, nausea,
and vomiting. Twelve patients (13%) had their dose
reduced by 1 level (50 mg/m2) and 3 patients (3%) had
their dose reduced by 2 levels (100 mg/m2). Thirty of 94
patients (32.0%) had drug administration interruptions
for a maximum of <5 days, 25 patients (27.0%) had drug
administration interruptions for a maximum of 5 to 10
days, and 11 patients (12.0%) had drug administration
interruptions for >10 days. Of the 312 cycles administered, dose interruptions occurred in 60 patients (63.8%)
as a result of toxicity.

Efficacy
Table 2 summarizes tumor response for the 68 patients
who were evaluable for efficacy. None of the patients had
a CR. Nine patients had a PR and the OR (CR þ PR) was
13.2% (95% CI, 7.1-23.3%). Nineteen patients (27.9%)
had SD (95% CI, 18.7-39.6%), and 40 patients (58.8%)
had PD (95% CI, 47.0-69.7%).
The median TTP for the efficacy-evaluable population was 10.3 weeks (95% CI, 9.4-14.4 weeks). The proportion of patients free of disease progression at 6 months
was 17% (95% CI, 8-25%). A Cox proportional hazards
regression model was used to relate TTP with ECOG performance status, patient age, ER/PR status, the interval
between diagnosis and on-study, the presence of visceral
metastases, the presence of bone metastases, the number
of prior metastatic chemotherapy regimens (1 or 2), and
prior hormone therapy. There were no significant predictors of TTP (P < .05) found in the evaluable population.
The median OS (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 61.6
weeks (95% CI, 42.3-81.3 weeks). The 6-month survival
rate was 77% (95% CI, 68-85%), and the 12-month survival rate was 56% (95% CI, 46-66%).

Safety and Tolerability
Of the 94 patients who received at least 1 dose of study
medication, 93 (98.9%) experienced at least 1 adverse
event. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse
events included nausea (72.3%), diarrhea (70.2%), vomiting (55.3%), asthenia (54.3%), abdominal pain
(36.2%), and stomatitis (28.7%).
Side effects were graded using the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2 (NCI CTC
v.2). Thirty-nine patients (41.5%) experienced at least 1
adverse event that was NCI CTC grade 3 or higher and
was considered related to study medication. The most

Cancer

May 15, 2010

commonly reported of these were diarrhea (19.1%), asthenia (12.8%), nausea (9.6%), and dehydration (7.4%).
Ten patients (10.6%) experienced at least 1 grade 3
or higher serious adverse event (SAE) that was considered
related to study medication. Study drug-related SAEs
included abdominal pain, dehydration, increased prothrombin time, diarrhea, vomiting, asthenia, fever, anorexia, and electrolyte abnormalities.

DISCUSSION
The combination of UFT and leucovorin given orally was
designed to be a potentially less-toxic and more convenient alternative therapy compared with the combination
of 5-FU and leucovorin given by iv infusion. This multicenter phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of
the oral combination given twice daily for the first 28 days
of a 35-day cycle in patients with recurrent metastatic
breast cancer who had been previously treated with
anthracyclines and/or taxanes.
Of the 68 patients who were evaluable for efficacy, 9
acheived PRs, for an OR of 13.2%. The median TTP was
approximately 10 weeks, and the median OS was approximately 62 weeks. Approximately 17% of patients were
free of disease progression at 6 months. Greater than half
of the patients experienced nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, or
asthenia. Approximately 40% experienced at least 1 grade
3 or higher adverse event.
These findings suggest that the oral combination
therapy of UFT and leucovorin, given in a twice-daily regimen, produces objective responses, although in this heavily pretreated population its activity appeared to be
modest. This is reflected in the low response rate and the
17% progression-free survival rate at 6 months. Grade 3
toxicities were manageable with appropriate dose adjustments in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously
treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes. However,
grade 3 or higher events were reported with greater frequency (41.5%) than with capecitabine (11.1%), another
fluoropyrimidine approved for the management of refractory breast cancer since these investigations began.17
Although intertrial comparisons are hazardous, capecitabine had substantial activity, with an 18% response rate
reported in a group of patients with disease that was refractory to anthracyclines and taxanes. It could be
hypothesized that, in addition to the different pharmacokinetic properties of UFT and capecitabine, the activation
of capecitabine at the local tumor site by thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme highly expressed by many breast

2305

Original Article

cancer cells, might provide higher concentrations of the
active metabolite at the site of metastatic deposits, thus
explaining the significant activity and modest systemic
toxicity of capecitabine.
When this trial was conducted, there were few
attractive new drugs under development. Today, there are
several exciting new drugs with demonstrated activity
against breast cancer. In that context, further trials with
UFT in metastatic breast cancer are less attractive.
