Abstract
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a member of the heat shock protein
family, plays a key role as a sensor and regulator of oxidative
stress. Herein, we identify HO-1 as a biomarker and potential
therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer (PCA).
Immunohistochemical analysis of prostate tissue using a
progression tissue microarray from patients with localized
PCA and across several stages of disease progression revealed
a significant elevation of HO-1 expression in cancer epithelial
cells, but not in surrounding stromal cells, from hormonerefractory PCA (HRPCA) compared with hormone-responsive
PCA and benign tissue. Silencing the ho-1 gene in HRPCA cells
decreased the HO-1 activity, oxidative stress, and activation of
the mitogen-activated protein kinase–extracellular signalregulated kinase/p38 kinase. This coincided with reduced cell
proliferation, cell survival, and cell invasion in vitro, as well
as inhibition of prostate tumor growth and lymph node and
lung metastases in vivo. The effect of ho-1 silencing on these
oncogenic features was mimicked by exposure of cells to a novel
selective small-molecule HO-1 inhibitor referred to as OB-24.
OB-24 selectively inhibited HO-1 activity in PCA cells, which
correlated with a reduction of protein carbonylation and
reactive oxygen species formation. Moreover, OB-24 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth
and lymph node/lung metastases in vivo. A potent synergistic
activity was observed when OB-24 was combined with Taxol.
Together, these results establish HO-1 as a potential therapeutic
target for advanced PCA. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8017–24]

Introduction
The progression of prostate cancer (PCA) to hormone-refractory
PCA (HRPCA) and to metastasis is an ominous event in patients
with advanced PCA. Currently, clinically available drugs for
advanced PCA and HRPCA have only marginal efficacy, and the
search for alternative therapeutics is under intensive investigation.
This study focuses on the biological and therapeutic implications
of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) for advanced PCA.

Mammalian cells express both HO-1 (heat shock protein 32) and
its isoform HO-2. These proteins are sensors and regulators of
oxidative stress and tissue redox homeostasis (reviewed in ref. 1).
Under normal physiologic conditions, HO-1 expression is low but
can be induced several-fold in response to a wide range of stimuli
and activated signaling molecules, including the HO-1 substrate
heme, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide species,
prostaglandins, cytokines, growth factors such as insulin, and
lipopolysaccharide. In contrast to HO-1, HO-2 is constitutively
expressed at high levels. HO-1 inducibility is primarily mediated
through transcriptional regulation via the presence of diverse
responsive elements in the ho-1 gene promoter (1, 2). HO-1
inducibility can also occur in response to oxidative stress–
mediated activation of upstream growth factor receptor signal
transduction pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated
kinases ERK1 and ERK2, c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase.
These pathways play important roles in the regulation of
mitogenesis and cell survival in the face of oxidative damage (3).
Moreover, HO-1 can modulate the activity of cell signaling
molecules such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which can be
either activated (moderate oxidative stress) to promote oxidative
stress–induced cell survival or inhibited (exacerbated oxidative
stress) to promote oxidative stress–mediated apoptosis (4).
The classic function of HO-1 is to catalyze heme oxidation to
biliverdin, free ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. Biliverdin is
further metabolized to bilirubin through the action of biliverdin
reductase. Bilirubin is then oxidized by cytochrome P450 enzymes
(e.g., Cyp1A1, Cyp2B1, or Cyp2A5), or glucuronidated by UDPglucuronyl-transferases, and subsequently eliminated as bilirubin
glucuronide by the biliary-excretory pathway. These HO-1–
mediated byproducts can exert broad physiologic effects in celladaptive response to oxidative stress. For instance, free iron
induces the expression of the iron-sequestering protein ferritin and
activates Fe-ATPase, an iron transporter that prevents accumulation of intracellular Fe2+. Up-regulation of ferritin and cytosolic
iron efflux has a protective effect against oxidative stress.
Intracellular carbon monoxide formed through HO-1 catalysis
can act as a secondary messenger, which, like nitric oxide, regulates
inflammatory signaling (1, 2, 5). Biliverdin and its by-product
bilirubin are antioxidants and prosurvival proteins capable of
reducing the inflammatory response and oxidative stress. Therefore,
the primary function of HO-1 is to regulate cellular homeostasis
and inflammatory response under oxidative stress and to promote
cell survival (6–8). Moreover, HO-1 can promote angiogenesis
through alternative mechanisms, including transcriptional upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and production of
proangiogenic carbon monoxide (9).

In cancer, overexpression of HO-1 has been reported in several
cancer tissues (10–12) and ho-1 gene polymorphisms have been
associated with increased cancer susceptibility (13). However, the
potential therapeutic implications of HO-1 have been hampered by
the lack of clinically useful selective inhibitors. In this study, we
show a robust overexpression of HO-1 in tissue samples from
patients with HRPCA compared with localized PCA and benign
prostate tissue. We established HO-1 as a potential therapeutic
target for HRPCA models. We identified a selective small-molecule
inhibitor of HO-1 (OB-24, the chemical structure is shown below)
synthesized from the imidazole class, and having potent antitumor
and antimetastatic activity in HRPCA preclinical models, particularly in combination with Taxol.

The chemical structure of 2-[2-(4-bromophenyl)ethyl]-2-[(1Himidazol-1-yl)methyl]-1,3-dioxolane hydrochloride (OB-24, MW:
373.67) is shown above.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents. HO-1 and HO-2 antibodies were from
StressGene and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively; antibodies against
ERK, p38, JNK, phospho-ERK (Tyr202/Tyr204), phospho-p38, and phosphoJNK were from Cell Signaling Technology; rabbit polyclonal antibody
specific to AKT and phospho-AKT were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) was from Cedarlane Laboratories; Taxol was from the oncology
pharmacy of the Jewish General Hospital; and OB-24 was synthesized as
described previously (14).
Cells and cell culture. The LNCaP, VCaP, and DU145 human PCA cell
lines were from the American Type Culture Collection. The castrationresistant C4-2 PCA cells, which was derived from the LNCaP cell line (15),
and the BPH-1 cells, which were derived from a benign prostate hyperplasic
lesion, were provided by Dr. N. Zoubeidi (The Prostate Centre, Vancouver
General Hospital). The highly invasive PC3M cell variant (16) was provided
by Dr. I. Fidler (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). The normal prostate
epithelial cells (PrEC) were from Clonetics and were maintained in their
proprietary serum-free media (Bulletkit, Clonetics Corporation). PC3M and
DU145 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. LNCaP, C4-2, VCaP, and BPH-1

cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics.
Generation of cells expressing HO-1 shRNA. The design of HO-1
shRNA sequences was based on the human ho-1 gene (Genbank
accession no. NM-002133.1). Two sequences were tested to be efficient
for ho-1 down-regulation: sequence 1, GGAGATTGAGCGCAACAAG
(17); sequence 2, CGGGCCAGCAACAAAGTGCAA (targeting ho-1
nucleotides 795–815, not reported before). A third negative sequence
(sequence 3, GCTTTCTGGTGGCGACAGT; targeting ho-1 nucleotides 904–
922) was used as a control. Each sequence was cloned into pSuper-retro
puromycin (PSR) vector according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Oligoengine). Cells stably expressing control retroviral vector PSR or HO-1
shRNA were generated as described earlier (18).
Western blot analysis. Cells at 60% to 70% confluence were starved for
24 h in phenol red– and FBS-free medium before analysis. When indicated,
HO-1 was induced by exposure of cells to hemin at a concentration of
10 Amol/L for 20 h. To determine the effect of HO-1 on mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) activity, serum-starved cells were stimulated with
5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) and cell extracts were used for
immunoblotting with antibody specific for phosphorylated ERKs, p38, JNK,
or AKT. Cell extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis as described
earlier (18) using the indicated antibodies.
Measurement of HO-1 activity. Cytosol extracts were prepared for HO
activity measurement as described by Ryter and colleagues (19). Bilirubin
concentrations in the chloroform cell extracts were determined by
spectrophotometry at 464- to 530-nm absorbance. HO-1 activity was
calculated as nanomoles of bilirubin per milligram of protein per minute,
assuming an extinction coefficient of 40/(mmol/L)/cm in chloroform.
Measurement of ROS and protein carbonylation. Intracellular ROS
levels were determined using the H2-DCF-DA reagent, based on the
methodology described by Wang and Joseph (20). Results, in arbitrary
fluorescence units (AFU), were expressed according to the ratio [AFU in
treated cells / AFU in control cells]  100. Cell fluorescence was also
confirmed using a FACS machine (Becton Dickinson) equipped with
CellQuest Pro Software. The data are presented as the ratio of mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) for 10,000 cells to MFI for 10,000 control cells.
Quantification of protein carbonyl content was investigated by ELISA as
reported earlier by Winterbourn and Buss (21).
Cell proliferation assay. Exponentially growing cells (1  103) were
seeded in 96-well plates in complete medium. Eighteen hours later, cells
were treated continuously with OB-24. Cell survival was evaluated 96 h later
using the MTT metabolic assay (18).
Cell invasion assay. Cell invasion assay was performed using 8-Am
porous chambers coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Detailed conditions were reported
earlier (18).
In vivo tumorigenic studies in mice. In vivo studies were approved by
the McGill Animal Care Committee (protocol number 4101) and were
conducted in accordance with institutional and Canadian Federal Guidelines.
Severe combined immunodeficient (Scid) male mice, in which PC3M cells
induce both macroscopic lymph node and lung metastases, were obtained
from Charles River Laboratories and anesthetized with isofluorane given by
inhalation. Cells (1  106) diluted in 50 AL Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution were
implanted into the prostate through a lower midline incision, and the incision
was closed with surgical metal clips. One week after implantation, mice were
blindly randomized to various experimental groups and treatment was
initiated 1 wk after cell inoculation using the indicated dosage and route. At
study termination, animals were sacrificed, prostate tumors were isolated and
weighed, and lymph and lung metastatic nodules were counted under a
stereomicroscope. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using a
computer-based statistical package from Statistical Product and Service
Solution (Chicago, IL). Unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare the
significance between groups. Differences among control and treated groups
were compared using variance (ANOVA) analysis and the Mann-Whitney U
test, with group as an independent variable and volume as a repeated measure.
A comparison between OB-24, Taxol, and combination treatment was
performed based on isobologram methodology initially reported by Chou

Moreover, the extent of expression was quantified into four subgroups of
<25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%. HO-1 expression was evaluated in both
the stromal and the epithelial compartments. Statistical analysis was done
using one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey HSD post hoc test. A P value of
V0.05 was considered statistically significant.

analysis. The study cohort consisted of 96 patients with benign prostate,
PCA, and HRPCA (Table 1). Tissue samples were obtained from
transuretheral resection of prostate representing locally advanced PCA.
Clinical and pathologic data were obtained with approval from the
institutional review board at the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General
Hospital in Montreal. Prostate samples were embedded in two tissue
microarray (TMA) blocks using a manual tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments), and TMA slides were established for at least 230 tissue samples as
was described earlier (23). Protein expression was categorized using a fourtiered system (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong) expression.

Epithelial HO-1 expression is associated with human PCA
progression. To assess the expression of HO-1 in relation to PCA
progression, we conducted immunohistochemistry screening using
a high-throughput TMA from PCA cases composed of benign
prostate, localized PCA, and HRPCA (Table 1). The normalized
mean epithelial expression of HO-1 in HRPCA was 1.88 F 0.99,
which was significantly higher than localized PCA (0.82 F 0.95;
P < 0.05) and benign prostate tissues (0.65 F 0.88; P < 0.01; Fig. 1A
and C). Unlike cancer epithelial cells, HO-1 expression in stromal
cells surrounding the cancer was not significantly different
between benign, localized PCA, and HRPCA tissues (Fig. 1B).
HO-1 regulates oxidative stress response and oncogenic
features in PCA cells. To examine the functional effect of HO-1 on
PCA cell progression, we compared basal HO-1 expression in
hormone-responsive (PrEC, BPH1, LNCaP, VCaP) and hormonerefractory (C4-2, DU145, PC3M) prostate cells maintained in phenol
red– and FBS-free medium. As shown in Fig. 2A (left), most PCA
cells express high basal levels of the HO-1 protein compared with
cells derived from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH-1) and
nonimmortalized normal PrEC. In all PCA cell lines, HO-1
expression was induced by hemin (Fig. 2A, right: representative
cell lines). In contrast to HO-1, HO-2 expression levels were not
different among the cell lines tested (not shown). To investigate the
effect of HO-1 on oncogenic features of PCA cells, PC3M cells stably
expressing HO-1 shRNA or empty retroviral particles (pSUPERretro vector, PSR) were isolated. As shown in Fig. 2B (left), Western
blot analysis confirmed an efficient reduction in HO-1 expression,
using two alternative shRNA sequences 1 and 2, and results were
compared with control PSR or a nonspecific HO-1 sequence 3. HO-2
expression was not affected by HO-1 shRNA. Biochemical assay
focusing on cells expressing HO-1 shRNA sequence 1 confirmed a
potent down-regulation of HO-1 activity in PC3M cells expressing
HO-1 shRNA (Fig. 2B, right). This coincided with a significant
decrease in cell proliferation after 48 to 72 hours of growth (Fig. 2C;
*, P V 0.05). Similar results were obtained using HO-1 shRNA
sequence 2 but not the nonspecific sequence 3 (not shown).
To understand the effect of HO-1 down-regulation on MAPK and
AKT signaling, we investigated the phosphorylation status of ERK,
p38, JNK, and AKT in serum-starved control and HO-1 shRNAexpressing PC3M cells stimulated with 5 ng/mL EGF. A preliminary
experiment in control cells indicated that EGF stimulates MAPK
phosphorylation with a maximum reached at 10 minutes, followed
by a gradual decrease over the ensuing 4 hours (not shown).
Therefore, the effect of HO-1 on MAPK and AKT activity was
investigated at 10 minutes. As shown in Fig. 2D, a significant
reduction in the activation of ERK and p38 (*, P V 0.01) was seen in
EGF-stimulated HO-1 sequence 1 shRNA-expressing cells compared with PSR EGF-stimulated control cells. In contrast, the levels
of JNK and AKT phosphorylation were not significantly affected
following HO-1 inhibition.
HO-1 inhibition prevents PCA progression in vitro and
in vivo. Because in vitro studies showed that a reduction of HO-1
expression caused a decrease in the proliferation of the PC3M cells,
we investigated the effect of HO-1 inhibition on PCA invasiveness

in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
invasive capacity of HO-1 knockdown PC3M cells to invade the
Matrigel was significantly decreased compared with PSR control cells
(*, P < 0.001). Furthermore, control PC3M cells and their matched
pair expressing HO-1 shRNA sequence 1 were implanted into the
mouse prostate and tumor growth was followed for a period of
f2 months. As shown in Fig. 3B to D, down-regulation of HO-1
significantly decreased primary tumor growth by f50% (Fig. 3B,
P < 0.01), and lymph nodes (Fig. 3C) and lung metastases (Fig. 3D)
by more than 60% (P V 0.005 compared with PSR control cells).
Selective targeting of HO-1 by a novel small-molecule
inhibitor mimics the antioncogenic features observed with
HO-1 shRNA on HRPCA cells. To investigate the therapeutic

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

potential of targeting HO-1 in PCA, we developed a small-molecule
inhibitor of HO-1 termed OB-24. OB-24 is an imidazole derivative
that functions as a selective inhibitor of HO-1 (the 50% inhibitory
activity of HO-1 and HO-2 was 1.9 F 0.2 Amol/L, using rat spleen
extracts, and >100 Amol/L, using rat brain extracts, respectively;
ref. 14). We further showed the selectivity of OB-24 toward HO-1 in
cancer cells using alternative approaches. First, we stably overexpressed the human HO-1 gene in rat glioma C6 cells; these cells
express very low levels of HO-1 protein. We found that exposure of
cells to 6.5 Amol/L OB-24 reduced cell proliferation by f10%, HO-1
activity by 59%, protein carbonylation by 40%, and intracellular
ROS by 43% compared with untreated HO-1–overexpressing cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

Targeting HO-1 in Prostate Cancer

In the second approach, we examined the effect of OB-24 on cell
proliferation, HO-1 activity, and oxidative stress in PCA cells. Taxol,
a major chemotherapy drug used for the treatment of advanced
PCA, was used as a control cytotoxic agent. Exposure of PC3M cells
to OB-24 at a concentration of 10 Amol/L, which induced f20%
growth inhibition (Fig. 4A), inhibited HO-1 levels by 62%. In
contrast, exposure of cells to 5 nmol/L Taxol had no inhibitory
effect but rather induced slightly, but not significantly, HO-1
activity compared with control cells. Cotreatment of cells with
OB-24+Taxol attenuated HO-1 activity by f26% compared with
Taxol alone (Fig. 4B, P < 0.05). Inhibition of HO-1 activity by OB-24
was also associated with f86% inhibition of protein carbonylation
[protein carbonylation levels were 3.614 F 0.3874 and 0.494 F 0.1382
(nmol/L)/mg protein for control and OB24-treated cells, P < 0.01]
and 26% inhibition of intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 4C), compared
with untreated controls. Moreover, OB-24 combined with Taxol
induced 54% inhibition of protein carbonylation compared with
Taxol-treated cells [protein carbonylation levels were 2.405 F 0.2242
and 1.1082 F 0.1961 (nmol/L)/mg protein for Taxol and OB24 +
Taxol, respectively; P < 0.01] and 25% inhibition of ROS levels
compared with cells treated with Taxol alone (P < 0.01; Fig. 4C). As
observed with HO-1 shRNA, exposure of PC3M cells to subtoxic
concentrations of OB-24 (5-10 Amol/L) reduced activation of the
MAPK ERK and p38 kinases but no clear inhibition was observed on
JNK or AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 4D).
Similar results were observed with the LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A–C, left) and their derived C4-2 hormone-refractory
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A–C, right), as well as DU145 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Inhibition of intracellular ROS levels by

OB-24 was slightly higher in C4-2 compared with LNCaP cells
(44% inhibition in C4-2 compared with 28% inhibition in LNCaP
cells, relative to untreated cells).
OB-24 induces antitumor and antimetastatic activity in the
PC3M preclinical model. To further examine the therapeutic
relevance of targeting HO-1 by OB-24 on the progression of
HRPCA, we conducted a preclinical study on mice bearing s.c.
or intraprostatic PC3M cancer cells. Intraprostate implantation of
PC3M cells resulted in aggressive tumor growth, culminating in
extensive lymph node and lung metastases. As shown in Fig. 5A,
treatment of mice bearing s.c. PC3M tumors with OB-24 at doses of
10 to 60 mg/kg (given i.p. on days 1, 3, and 5 per cycle, with a total
of four cycles) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth. Using this schedule, no body weight loss was observed
(not shown). OB-24 given at 30 mg/kg resulted in a similar
therapeutic activity as 10 mg/kg Taxol given at the same schedule
and route (Fig. 5B). Importantly, a potent therapeutic effect was
observed when OB-24 was combined with Taxol, yielding >90%
reduction in tumor growth (Fig. 5B). Isobologram analysis
confirmed a CI value of 0.74 (P V 0.01), an indication of synergy.
In the LNCaP model, treatment with OB-24 using similar conditions as the PC3M models also induced antitumor activity. However,
the combination with Taxol was not conclusive because LNCaP
tumors were highly responsive to Taxol (Supplementary Fig. S4).
We next investigated the therapeutic activity of OB-24 given alone
at 10 or 30 mg/kg and in combination with Taxol given at 10 mg/kg.
Both OB-24 and Taxol were given i.v. on days 1, 3, and 5 per cycle for
four cycles to mice bearing palpable PCA (1 week after PC3M cell
implantation). The control group received the vehicle alone. As

stress in PC3M cells. A, PC3M was treated with OB-24 at the indicated
concentrations for 96 h. Cell proliferation was estimated using the MTT assay
as described in Materials and Methods. HO-1 activity (B) and intracellular ROS
levels (C ) were determined in whole extracts from PC3M cell treated with
10 Amol/L OB-24, 5 nmol/L Taxol, or both. D, PC3M cells were serum starved,
treated with the vehicle alone or OB-24, and then stimulated with EGF. Total
cell lysates were collected 10 min after stimulation; phosphorylated and total
ERK, p38, JNK, and AKT were measured (left). Graphs (right ) represent
the average ratios of phosphorylated/total proteins from three independent
determinations with SD <15%. *, P < 0.05.

shown in Fig. 5C, OB-24 at 30 mg/kg reduced tumor growth and
lymph node and lung metastases by f50%, whereas OB-24 at 10 mg/
kg was less effective. Remarkably, the inhibitory effects of OB-24
exceeded 90% when this molecule was combined with Taxol (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
The implication of oxidative stress in genomic instability, cancer
development, and cancer progression has been supported by
experimental and clinical studies (24–26). Moreover, high levels of
oxidative stress have been documented in cancer cells and human
cancer tissues, including from PCA (12, 27–30).
The inducible HO-1 is recognized as cytoprotective against
oxidative stress (1, 2). HO-1 up-regulation can generally confer
‘‘antioxidant’’ protection by accelerating the degradation of
prooxidant heme to the radical scavenging bile pigments biliverdin
and bilirubin. However, under certain conditions, up-regulation of
HO-1 and generation of heme-derived iron and carbon monoxide
can promote ROS accumulation within the mitochondrial and
other cellular compartments. The activity and temporal pattern of
HO-1 expression and the chemistry of the local redox microenvironment can determine whether the free radical damage accruing
from intracellular iron/carbon monoxide or the antioxidant
benefits of a diminished heme-to-bilirubin ratio predominate. For

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

this reason, HO-1 is often referred to in the literature as a ‘‘doubleedged sword’’ enzyme (31–33).
In this study, we provide evidence that HO-1 is prooxidant in
PCA cells. We observed a significant up-regulation of HO-1 in a
large set of human HRPCA tissues relative to benign prostate tissue
and localized PCA, further implicating HO-1 in PCA progression.
We showed that overexpression of the HO-1 gene resulted in enhanced
HO-1 activity and higher levels of ROS and protein carbonylation. In
contrast, inhibition of HO-1 in HRPCA cells decreased heme
oxygenase activity, protein carbonylation, and intracellular levels of
ROS and inhibited several oncogenic features, including cell
proliferation, and cell invasion in vitro, as well as tumor growth and
metastasis formation in vivo. Biochemical studies revealed that
inhibition of HO-1 in HRPCA cells reduced EGF-induced MAPK-ERK
and p38 activation. These MAPKs have been reported to regulate
both HO-1 activity and inducibility (34–36) and to play a broad
function in the regulation of mitogenic-, survival-, and invasionassociated signaling (18, 37, 38). Inhibition of ERK and p38 activities
following HO-1 down-regulation could contribute, at least in part, to
the effect of HO-1 shRNA on the multiple oncogenic features of PC3M
cells, observed both in vitro and in vivo.
An important translational aspect of this study is the
therapeutic activity of the HO-1 small-molecule inhibitor OB-24,
which was found to mimic the activity of HO-1 shRNA in PCA

cells. OB-24, a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the HO-1
enzyme, selectively inhibits HO-1 but not HO-2, and prevents
the growth and metastasis formation in the PC3M preclinical
model. Moreover, a potent synergistic activity was seen when
OB-24 was combined with the chemotherapy drug Taxol,
where more than 90% reduction of lymph node and lung
metastases was observed compared with f50% for Taxol or
OB-24 given alone. Taxol has no inhibitory effect on HO-1 but
rather can slightly induce HO-1 activity in cancer cells, as
evidenced by an increase in bilirubin levels. Interestingly, we
observed a decrease in HO-1 activity and ROS levels following
exposure to Taxol+OB-24; this combination resulted in an
increase in apoptosis compared with cells treated with OB-24
or Taxol alone (Supplementary Table S1). Some studies have
reported a role of ROS in Taxol-induced cytotoxicity (39). However,
the bulk of the literature established that Taxol interaction with
microtubules (through stabilization of microtubule-associated
proteins) is a key mechanism of Taxol function (40–43). Therefore,
we hypothesize that non-ROS mechanisms such as inhibition
of the proangiogenic or proinflammatory signaling of HO-1 by
OB-24 may contribute to the synergistic activity observed.

Although our results in human tissues and PCA cell lines support
a role of HO-1 in PCA progression, and in particular HRPCA, the
connection between HO-1 expression and androgen response
remains to be established. Androgens, including testosterone, are
known to regulate the redox system. In particular, treatment of
androgen-responsive PCA cells with testosterone is reported to
decrease antioxidant response and enhance cell susceptibility to
oxidative stress (44). Moreover, decreased HO-1 protein levels were
found in ventral prostate from castrated rats compared with
controls, whereas administration of androgen increased HO-1
expression (45). Thus, androgens seem to suppress oxidative stress
and loss of androgen receptor (AR) response may enhance oxidative
stress and hence HO activity. These observations are in agreement
with our finding of augmented oxidative stress in the ARnonresponsive PC3M, C4-2, and DU145 cells relative to ARresponsive PCA cells and normal PrEC. Whether these effects are
due to a direct connection to androgen signaling pathways or an
indirect consequence of feedback regulatory loops remains to be
investigated, particularly because HO-1 inhibition also affects ROS
formation and the oncogenic features of the androgen-responsive
cell LNCaP.

The effect of OB-24 on inhibition of PCA cell invasion clearly
indicates that targeting HO-1 in HRPCA cells affects major
signaling pathways that regulate tumor progression to aggressive
phenotypes, and its synergistic activity with Taxol are significant
given the limited therapeutic options available for HRPCA patients
in clinical practice. Historically, standard chemotherapy including
taxanes has provided limited benefits for the treatment of HRPCA,
whereas alternative therapeutic modalities, including inhibitors of
adrenal androgen and estrogenic compounds, are under investigation (46–48). OB-24 is a promising novel targeted therapeutic
agent that deserves further molecular and preclinical studies in
relation to HRPCA, particularly when combined with taxanes.
