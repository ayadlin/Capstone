Author Manuscript

Non-neuronal expression of components of the glutamatergic system has been increasingly
observed, and our laboratory previously had demonstrated the etiological role of ectopically
expressed metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (Grm1/mGluR1) in mouse models of melanoma. We
hypothesize that inappropriate glutamatergic signaling in other cell types can dysregulate growth
leading to transformation and tumorigenesis. As most cancers are carcinomas, we selected an
immortalized primary baby mouse kidney (iBMK) cell model to assess whether Grm1 can
transform epithelial cells. These iBMK cells, engineered to be immortal yet non-tumorigenic and
retaining normal epithelial characteristics, were used as recipients for exogenous Grm1 cDNA.
Several stable Grm1 expressing clones were isolated and the Grm1-receptors were shown to be
functional, as evidenced by the accumulation of second messengers in response to Grm1 agonist.
Additionally activated by agonist were MAPK and AKT signaling cascades, major intracellular
pathways shown by many investigators to be critical in melanomagenesis and other neoplasms.
These Grm1-iBMK cells exhibited enhanced cell proliferation in in vitro MTT assays and
significant tumorigenicity in in vivo allografts. Persistent Grm1 expression was required for the
maintenance of the in vivo tumorigenic phenotype as demonstrated by an inducible Grm1silencing RNA. These are the first results that indicate Grm1 can be an oncogene in epithelial
cells. Additionally, relevance to human disease in the corresponding tumor type of renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) may be suggested by observed expression of GRM1/mGluR1 in a number of
RCC tumor biopsy samples and cell lines, and the effects of GRM1 modulation on tumorigenicity
therein. Moreover RCC cell lines exhibited elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, and some

possible role for glutamate signaling apparatus in RCC cell growth, and that the glutamatergic
system may be a therapeutic target in renal cell carcinoma.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Although recognition of the glutamatergic system has been restricted to customary roles in
the central nervous system (CNS) and linked neuropathologies, expression in a variety of
tissues has come to be acknowledged [1–9]. Among such varied functions as in metabolism
and structure, L-glutamate also is an evolutionarily conserved cell signaling molecule [10].
It thus becomes likely that dysfunction of the glutamatergic system can lead to diverse
disease types in humans including those of cell growth, or cancer.

Author Manuscript

In fact our laboratory was first to implicate an aberrantly expressed metabotropic glutamate
receptor, Grm1, in the etiology of a neoplasm - melanoma - and subsequently demonstrated
its significance in the progression of human malignancy [11–13]. Shin et al., offered
corroboration in a report that introduction of Grm1 into immortalized non-tumorigenic
mouse melanocytic cell lines can remove their requirement for TPA for in vitro growth, and
render the cells tumorigenic in vivo [14]. More recent work has developed a sound rationale
for targeting this receptor for therapy in melanocytic disease [15, 16]. Recently additional
members of the metabotropic glutamate receptor family, Grm5 and GRM3, were shown to
be important in melanoma pathogenesis [17, 18]. Results from these studies further associate
glutamate signaling and melanoma.

Author Manuscript

Despite that melanocytes and neurons may have in common developmental origins from the
embryonic neural crest, the intracellular signaling pathways accessible by these
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlus) are distributed generally among diverse cell
types. In experimental systems designed to study synaptic function, for example, it has been
shown that ectopically expressed mGlus including Grm1 can successfully link to
endogenous signaling apparatus [19]. It is also noteworthy that concentrations of glutamate,
the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS and natural ligand for these receptors, can
be orders of magnitude higher outside of the closely controlled microenvironment of the
synapse [20], and that activated mGlu receptors can couple indirectly to glutamate release,
invoking an autocrine-like loop [14, 21]. Additionally, various G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs) including the glutamate receptors may exhibit constitutive basal activity without
the need for agonists [22].
We suggest that activity of an otherwise normal glutamate receptor in an ectopic cellular
milieu can activate signaling pathways which dysregulate cell growth and ultimately lead to
tumor formation. As most human cancers are of epithelial origin (carcinomas), we propose a
model system to investigate whether Grm1 can transform epithelial cells. As part of a design

to interrogate mechanisms of epithelial tumor progression, primary mouse epithelial cells
underwent genetically defined immortalization that permitted the retention of normal
epithelial characteristics, including a lack of innate tumorigenicity [23, 24]. The resulting
W2 baby mouse kidney (iBMK) cells facilitate in vivo screening for elements that enable
tumorigenesis, and cells of the sibling D3 line, additionally engineered for apoptosisimpairment, allow for examination of factors that promote tumor growth.
In this report we demonstrate that full-length wild-type Grm1 is tumorigenic when
ectopically expressed in epithelial cells, and also couples to MAPK and AKT signaling, two
of the hallmark activated signaling pathways fundamental to growth, proliferation, and
survival in cancer cells, including melanoma. In addition, a role for glutamate signaling
apparatus in Renal Cell Carcinoma tumor cell growth is explored.

Results
Stable expression of exogenous Grm1 in W2- and D3 iBMK epithelial cells
Coding sequence for full-length form of the Grm1 receptor was subcloned into standard
mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega). This expression construct, or an emptyvector control, was transfected into W2- and D3 iBMK epithelial cells. Individual drugresistant clones were isolated, expanded, and screened by Western immunoblot for Grm1
expression, which was detected at various levels in several stable Grm1 clones, but not in
empty-vector controls or parental W2 and D3 cell lines (Fig. 1a). A number of Grm1expressing and empty-vector control lines were selected for more detailed analysis.

Accumulation of second messenger IP3 in W2- and D3-Grm1 clones is
specifically induced by Grm1-agonist—Guided by previous studies of G-protein
coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling, both in the CNS and in melanoma
derived tumor cells [15, 25, 26], functionality of the exogenous receptor was assessed in
W2- and D3-Grm1 clones by the accumulation of the phospholipase C second messenger
inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) following challenge with Grm1-agonist. Results from a
typical experiment for each cell type are shown (Fig. 1b). Whereas stimulation by the
pharmacological agonist, L-quisqualic acid (Q), led to a significant increase in IP3 levels
over vehicle-only treated W2- and D3-Grm1 cells, in all such clones examined the increase
in IP3 was abrogated by pre-incubation of the cells with the Grm1-receptor specific noncompetitive antagonist BAY 36-7620 (BAY). Fetal bovine serum, as a positive control for
the system, led to an increase in IP3 similar to that produced by the agonist Q (data not
shown). Empty-vector transfectants (W2- and D3-vec) did not exhibit a Grm1-specific
response. The IP3 results are thus indicative of both the functionality and specificity of the
exogenous Grm1-encoded cell surface receptor introduced into the cells.
MAPK/ERK is specifically activated by Grm1 agonist in both W2- and D3-Grm1
cells—Over-activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathways is a hallmark of many
neoplasms, including melanoma. Phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 (MAPK3 and MAPK1), as
assessed by immunoblot, was the read-out used to report MAPK pathway activation by

stimulation of exogenous Grm1-receptor. A maximal activation was seen within five
minutes of induction by the agonist Q, followed by a slower diminution of signal. Typical
results at the maximum are seen in Fig. 2a and 2b. Once more, specificity of signaling was
demonstrated by pre-incubation with the Grm1-receptor specific antagonist BAY; under this
condition ERK/MAPK cannot be activated by Grm1-agonist.

Author Manuscript

AKT is specifically activated by Grm1 agonist in both W2- and D3-Grm1 cells
—Recently studies in our laboratory indicated that the Grm1-receptor could additionally
signal to the AKT pathway in melanoma cells [27]. This pathway is known for roles in both
mitogenic signaling and cell survival, and has increasingly become a focus in multiple
malignancies. In experiments exactly parallel to those for ERK 1/2, AKT was also
specifically stimulated or inhibited by Grm1-agonist or antagonist, respectively, again
demonstrating a functioning receptor. A time-dependent activation in pAKT again paralleled
that of pERK, with a slight lag, i.e. a maximal stimulation closer to 10 minutes. A typical
experiment is shown (Fig. 2c).
In vitro growth properties of W2- and D3-Grm1 cells
W2-Grm1 clones uniformly exhibited an increased growth rate in vitro compared to W2-vec
controls as measured by standard MTT cell proliferation/viability assays. D3-Grm1 clones
also displayed a consistent, but somewhat lesser increase in growth relative to D3-vec cells,
as might be expected given that their D3 parental cells are already partially transformed/
tumorigenic by engineered apoptosis-defect (Supp. Fig. 1).

We were however much more interested in the definitive measurement of neoplastic
transformation: in vivo tumorigenicity. Several independent stable W2-Grm1 and D3-Grm1
iBMK clones were inoculated subcutaneously into the dorsal flanks of nude mice to
establish allografts (n=20 each). As they developed, tumor dimensions were measured by
vernier caliper twice-weekly. Each study was terminated when tumor burden grew too great
as per institutional guidelines. W2-Grm1 cells were permitted 13 weeks of growth after
inoculation before termination. Depending on the independent W2-Grm1 clone in question,
tumor volume averaged more than 500 – 800 mm3. No measurable tumors whatsoever were
observed from empty-vector transfected W2-vec cells at this endpoint (Fig 3a). D3-Grm1
tumors became palpable one week post-injection. When D3-Grm1 line studies were ended
after 8 weeks, tumors of D3-Grm1 clones had reached a mean size approaching 1400 mm3,
whereas D3-vec cell tumors averaged only approximately one-fifth that volume (P < 0.001,
ANOVA) (Fig. 3b). Only excised W2-Grm1 and D3-Grm1 tumor samples expressed Grm1,
as evaluated by immunoblots (Fig. 3a and 3b). Despite that parental D3 cells are already
partially transformed/tumorigenic by engineered apoptosis-defect [28], Grm1-receptor
expression most obviously enhanced in vivo tumorigenic growth potential. Figure 3 also
illustrates Grm1-iBMK epithelial cell allograft-tumor growths, and the characteristic effects
of tumor angiogenesis overtly visible through skin as feeder blood vessels. As previously
seen by Degenhardt et al., local invasion of iBMK allograft-tumors was noted along with
frequent angiogenesis, and were classified as highly aggressive carcinomas. Representative

high magnification photomicrographs of H&E stained formalin-fixed sections of tumors at
termination of a study are also shown (Fig. 3).
Sustained expression of Grm1 is required to maintain W2- or D3-Grm1 tumorigenic
phenotypes in vivo

Author Manuscript

To determine whether sustained Grm1 expression is required to maintain the tumorigenic
phenotypes, a doxycycline inducible anti-Grm1 siRNA expression system was introduced
into the W2- and D3-Grm1 clones. Anti-Grm1 and anti-GFP-control siRNA constructs
respectively permitted assessing the effect of successful knockdown of Grm1, and the effect
of an unrelated negative control (siGFP). Several independent Grm1-siRNA clones were
isolated and evaluated first in vitro, by immunoblotting. siGrm1 - but not siGFP - clones
demonstrated consistent reduction of Grm1 protein levels in the presence of inducer;
examples shown in Fig. 4a. Next we assessed by allograft whether a reduction of Grm1
levels modulated tumorigenesis in vivo. Upon initial appearance of palpable tumors mice
were randomly segregated into two groups with equivalent tumor size (≤10 mm3), and
doxycycline was thereafter included in the drinking water of the treated group (0.1% w/v).
Each study was terminated after a set period, or when tumor burden became excessive.
Whereas there were no significant differences in allograft tumor growth observed between
doxycycline treated and untreated W2- and D3-Grm1-siGFP (control siRNA) mice, there
was sizeable inhibition of tumorigenesis in W2- (n=20, P < 0.05, t test) and D3-Grm1siGrm1 (n=20, P < 0.001, t test) mice treated with doxycycline to induce siRNA knockdown
of Grm1 (Fig. 4b).
GRM1 and the glutamatergic system in renal cell carcinoma

Author Manuscript

Although originally designed only to substantiate the hypothesis that components of the
glutamatergic system such as metabotropic glutamate receptors can play a role in tumor cell
growth, the clear results from our mouse kidney epithelial cell model system compelled us
to undertake preliminary investigation of relevance to human disease in the corresponding
tumor type of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We determined to first extend the investigation
with RCC cell lines.

Author Manuscript

RCC cell lines express GRM1—Total RNA was isolated from a panel of four standard
RCC cell lines, UOK115, UOK117, UOK121, and UOK122, originally established from
resected stage IV disease tumors [29]. Results from initial reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed using gene specific primers, demonstrated GRM1
transcripts in these RCC cell lines, but not in HEK293, a human embryonic kidney cell line
used as control (Supp. Fig. 2). Fittingly, HEK293 commonly is used as a recipient for
exogenous metabotropic glutamate receptors to study individual mGlu function away from
the synaptic environment [30–32]. Expression was also seen in the RCC cell lines at the
protein level, but not in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5). Included as controls in the immunoblot were
GRM1-negative p’mel* immortalized human melanocytes [33], as well as a stable GRM1+
p’mel* clone transfected with exogenous human GRM1 cDNA, and the GRM1+ human
metastatic melanoma C8161+ cell line [34].

RCC cell lines release glutamate—We measured the levels of extracellular glutamate
in these RCC cell lines, as varied studies, including ours with melanoma, have suggested
that G protein-coupled receptors with oncogenic activity frequently display locally enhanced
levels of ligand produced and released by tumor cells (autocrine) or surrounding cells
(paracrine) [35, 36]. These measurements were done in parallel with MTT cell proliferation/
viability assays to be sure any increases in extracellular glutamate were not due to release by
cell death (Fig. 6a). Each of the RCC lines showed several-fold excess in levels of
extracellular glutamate compared to control HEK293 cells (ex. under these conditions,
UOK117 a maximum upwards of 300μM glutamate, and HEK293 never more than 1/10 of
that). Even when adjusted for differences in growth rate over the course of the experiment as
measured by MTT, the contrast between the RCC cells and HEK293 remained striking (Fig.
6b).

RCC cells respond to the anti-glutamatergic drug riluzole—Originally approved
by the FDA as a neuroprotective agent known to inhibit glutamate release, riluzole
previously was shown by our group to reduce the growth of melanoma tumor cells that
release elevated levels of extracellular glutamate [14, 15]. Analyses were performed on RCC
cells treated with this anti-glutamatergic drug at a working concentration guided by pilot
experiments and previous studies in melanoma [14, 15]. First, MTT cell proliferation/
viability assays demonstrated two RCC lines were growth-inhibited by riluzole beyond the
response of control HEK293 cells to the drug. UOK115 by about 20% and UOK117 by
about 50%, after treatment for 96 h at 25μM (Fig. 7). Next, cell cycle analyses were
performed on RCC cells treated with riluzole at the same concentration, for the indicated
time periods. Population distributions of HEK293 cells were not affected by riluzole at this
concentration, however UOK115 and UOK117 showed consistent alterations (Fig 8a). At 72
h, RCC cell line UOK115 responded to riluzole with accumulation at G2/M. For UOK117,
there was a considerable increase in cells accumulated in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle
after 48 and 72 h, indicating cellular apoptosis. The customary marker of PARP cleavage
corroborated this as shown by immunoblot (Fig 8b). In summary, two of the panel of four
RCC lines responded to riluzole with either the apparent cytostatic (UOK115) or cytotoxic/
apoptotic (UOK117) effect of the drug each typically seen in our lab for different human
melanoma cell lines [14, 15].

Sustained expression of GRM1 is required to maintain UOK117 RCC
tumorigenic phenotype in vivo—To examine whether interference in the expression of
GRM1 in RCC cells would affect their tumorigenic phenotype in vivo, an anti-GRM1
siRNA expression system was introduced into UOK117 RCC cells, in an experimental
protocol exactly paralleling that of engineered iBMK-Grm1 clones described above. An
evaluation of doxycycline-induced silencing in three of the independently isolated GRM1siRNA lines is shown by immunoblotting in Fig. 9a. From these, Clones 2 and 4 were
selected for xenograft. At the termination of the in vivo studies, a marked inhibition of tumor
progression was noted (Fig. 9b) in doxycycline treated mice (both clones n=20, P < 0.001, t
test). Results thus implied sustained expression of GRM1 is at least in part necessary to
maintain UOK117 tumor progression in vivo.

RCC tumor tissues express GRM1—Although both the available anti-human GRM1
antibodies, and the inherent heterogeneity and variability of tissues obtained during surgical
procedures can be problematic, the results from cultured RCC cells compelled us, for
completeness, to perform initial experiments to assess GRM1 expression in tumor tissue. A
small collection of six pairs of anonymized tumor and adjacent “normal” biopsy-tissue
sections from patients with RCC, was obtained through the Tissue Retrieval Service at the
Cancer Institute of New Jersey and analyzed for GRM1 protein by immunohistochemistry
(IHC). Initial results, both visual by photomicroscopy, and unbiased quantitative assessment
of IHC staining of digitized slides using an Aperio ScanScopeGL system with ImageScope
software, indicated that GRM1 is expressed in at least a subset of these tissues. It is readily
apparent in a representation (Fig. 10a) of the automated quantification, that in these samples,
there was on average a greater number of GRM1+ cells in those tissues that had been
designated tumor, than those termed adjacent normal. Interestingly, in some slides the IHC
revealed visually provocative patterning of GRM1+ stained cells displaying classic crab-like
invasion into an area of unstained cells, or in others, characteristic tumor-like cellular
disorganization (Fig. 10b).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Previously our laboratory reported a line of transgenic mice (TG-3), which displays
spontaneous melanoma with 100% penetrance due to an insertional mutagenesis causing a
constitutive mis-expression of Grm1 in its melanocytes [11, 13]. The significance of Grm1
(mGluR1) receptors in the progression of human melanoma was subsequently demonstrated
[11, 15]. It was established that in TG-3 tumor-derived cells, like in the CNS, Grm1
signaling coupled through a G-protein to phospholipase C (PLC) and its second messengers
inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) [26] - part of a signaling
apparatus available to many mammalian cell types. Although melanoma is one of the most
deadly cancers, carcinomas are by far the most common. We thus set out to assess whether
Grm1 is able to transform epithelial cells.

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that activity of an otherwise normal glutamate receptor in an ectopic
cellular milieu can activate signaling pathways which dysregulate cell growth and ultimately
lead to tumor formation in epithelial cells. Indeed, functional expression of Grm1 in normal
W2 baby mouse kidney epithelial cells enabled a tumorigenic potential as evidenced in
allograft assays, whereas empty-vector transfected W2-vec cell inoculations remained tumor
free in vivo. Although D3 cells already have been partially transformed by engineered
apoptosis-defect and are tumorigenic [24], it is readily apparent from our results that
expression of functional Grm1-receptor significantly enhanced and accelerated the
tumorigenic potential of D3 cells relative to multiple empty-vector control lines in vivo.
Inducible silencing RNA against Grm1 was used to demonstrate that sustained expression of
Grm1 is required to maintain W2- or D3-Grm1 tumorigenic phenotypes. It additionally was
shown that in both W2- and D3-Grm1 epithelial cells, the exogenous receptor specifically
activated endogenous MAPK and AKT signaling pathways when stimulated by Grm1agonist.

It is an attractive concept that signaling from a single cell-surface metabotropic glutamate
receptor can activate at least two of the hallmark activated signaling pathways thought to
play essential roles in growth, survival, invasion, and even angiogenesis and in human
tumors, MAPK and AKT [37–41].

Author Manuscript

It may be argued that the human tumor type corresponding to that of our experimental
mouse model system is kidney cancer, a neoplasm newly affecting over 65,000 persons and
responsible for more than 13,000 deaths in the United States this year [42]. The incidence of
this neoplasm has been steadily increasing worldwide for decades [43–45]. By far the most
common type, renal cell carcinoma or RCC is thought to originate in the lining of the
proximal convoluted tubule. Interestingly, renal cell carcinoma is one of the coexistent or
subsequent primary neoplasms that have been reported in statistically significant higher
incidence in patients diagnosed with melanoma [46, 47]. Our initial studies demonstrated
GRM1 expression in tested subsets of RCC cell lines and tumors, and indicated a
susceptibility of RCC cells to drugs which modulate the glutamatergic system. Further
investigation into the necessity for sustained expression of GRM1 in human RCC cells
implied that, at least in a subset of cases, it may be one of the requirements for maintenance
of the tumorigenic phenotype in vivo. These findings suggest a possible role for glutamate
signaling apparatus in RCC cell growth and maintenance.

Author Manuscript

Much early effort researching the glutamatergic system was restricted to the CNS.
Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlus), originally thought to be confined to neural cells,
may have more diverse physiological functions as they have been found to be expressed in a
range of non-neuronal tissues in recent years. After Grm1/mGluR1 first was linked to
melanomagenesis by Chen et al., various mGlus subsequently have been implicated in
human melanoma and an increasing subset of human malignancies [17, 18, 48]. The
metabotropic glutamate receptors are highly druggable GPCRs [49]. For example
appropriate pharmacologic modulation of mGlu2/3 and mGlu4, respectively, inhibited the
growth of human glioma cells in culture [50] and medulloblastomas in xenografts [51].

Author Manuscript

It may thus be suggested that modulation of the glutamatergic system can offer therapeutic
benefits in non-neuronal neoplasms as well. Significant investigation over the past few years
has gone into design and testing of therapeutics to modulate the glutamatergic system to
address a diversity of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders [52–54], and it may be
possible to leverage these studies in the quest for anticancer therapeutics. Riluzole, the antiglutamatergic drug used in this study, is the only US FDA approved treatment for the
neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [55, 56]. Recent work by
Chen and Goydos groups indicated that riluzole reduced melanoma-cell glutamate release,
resulted in cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis in vitro, and impeded xenografted
melanoma tumor growth in vivo [15, 57, 58]. These preclinical results led to an exploratory
Phase 0 clinical trial of oral riluzole in patients with advanced melanoma. Pre- and posttreatment tumor biopsies and PET scans were performed to monitor cellular response and
tumor metabolic activity. Assessment of proliferation and apoptotic markers revealed that
four of eleven patients who completed the protocol had pronounced responses to riluzole
administration as shown by increased apoptosis and tumor shrinkage [16]. The completion

of a more significant Phase II clinical trial of the drug for anti-melanoma therapy is expected
presently.

Author Manuscript

In addition to having been observed in a subset of aggressive melanoma cell lines as
compared to normal melanocytes and where so far linked with GRM1 expression [14, 15],
amplified release of extracellular glutamate has been noted in malignant gliomas [59], in cell
lines of varied tumor-types in bone metastases [60, 61], and more recently in triple-negative
breast cancer cells [62], again implying correlation of the glutamatergic system with
malignant potential. Current interest in the distinctive metabolic changes in cancer cells and
their relationships with signaling networks and proliferation includes investigations of
glutamate both as a cellular messenger and as a metabolic support, particularly as a product
of glutaminase in glutaminolysis [63]. Given our own published and unpublished
observations, and examples such as in bone metastasis [61] and breast cancer [62], it is thus
somewhat encouraging for prospective therapeutic benefit that the glutamate transport
system in cancer cells can be modulated pharmacologically.
Taken together, the results presented in this report establish that Grm1 indeed can be
oncogenic in epithelial cells and can activate multiple characteristic cancer-signaling
pathways - and that components of the glutamatergic system are active in renal cell
carcinoma. Although beyond the scope of the current work, our preliminary observations
offer a rationale for both comprehensive survey of expression of GRM1 and other
metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are highly druggable GPCRs, and systematic
examination of other elements of glutamate signaling, as possible novel targets for renal cell
carcinoma therapy.

Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were resolved by Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by wet tank electroblotting.
After overnight incubation with primary antibodies, blots were visualized with Amersham
ECL-HRP Linked Secondary Antibodies and ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection
Reagents (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Densitometry by OptiQuant
software (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Author Manuscript

The Tissue Analytical Services at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey performed standard
IHC for GRM1, and unbiased quantitative assessment of IHC staining was completed using
a digital Aperio ScanScopeGL system and ImageScope software (v 10.1.3.2028) (Aperio
Technologies Inc., Vista, CA) according to the manufacture’s protocol with modifications as
described [69].
Cell proliferation/viability (MTT) assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were typically seeded at 1 – 2×103 cells per well in a 96-well culture plate. At
designated time-points, 0.1 volumes of 5mg/ml Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 1X PBS were added to growth medium, incubated for 4
hours at 37°C, then solubilized overnight at 37°C with an equal volume of 10% SDS/0.1 M
HCl. A 96-well plate reader (Infinite 200 Tecan USA, Durham, NC, USA) was used to
measure absorbance at 550 nm with a reference wavelength of 750 nm.
In vivo tumor growth assay
Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Use and Care of
Animals and the Animal Care and Facilities Committee of Rutgers University. Expanded
from independent clones, 106 cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml sterile PBS and injected
subcutaneously into the dorsal flanks of nude mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY, USA) to

establish allografts or xenografts. Tumors were measured with a vernier caliper twiceweekly, and tumor volume was calculated as V = d2 × D/2 [70]. Studies were terminated as
soon as tumor volumes reached maximally permissible size.
Glutamate release assay
Glutamate concentration in culture medium “conditioned” by tumor cells was measured by
enzyme-based colorimetric assay in a microplate reader at 450nm as per the manufacturer
(Glutamate Assay Kit, Biovision, Mountain View, CA, USA). Cells were generally seeded
at 1 – 2×103 per well and cultured in 200 μl glutamate/glutamine-free medium as described
above, with 10% dialyzed FBS. At measurement half the volume was removed from each
well for glutamate assay, and cell-viability immediately assessed by MTT assay.
Cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated at 5×105 – 1×106 per 100-mm dish and treated with 25μM riluzole,
vehicle (DMSO), or left un-treated, for 24–72hrs as specified. Adherent and floating cells
were pooled, pelleted, washed twice with ice-cold 1X PBS, fixed by drop-wise addition of
ice-cold 70% ethanol while mixing, and stored at −20°C. Fixed cells were washed twice
with and resuspended in 1X PBS, treated with RNase A solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) at 100 μg/ml and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 10
μg/ml for 30 min. Cell cycle analysis was performed on a Coulter Cytomics FC500 Flow
Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) at the Analytical Cytometry Core
Facility, Rutgers University.

A. Expression of exogenous Grm1/mGluR1 receptor in stable W2- and D3 iBMK epithelial
cell clones. iBMK epithelial cells were transfected with the full-length form of the receptor
in pCI-neo or empty-vector pCI-neo alone (vec). Independent stable G418r clones exhibited
varying levels of Grm1 expression detectable at approximately 150 kD by immunoblotting.
No expression was observed in parental iBMK or vec transfected cells. Total ERK at 42/44
kD was used as a loading control. Densitometry presented graphically.
B. Exogenous Grm1/mGluR1 receptor is functional in W2- and D3-Grm1 cells as assessed
by accumulation of second messenger IP3 that is specifically induced by Grm1-agonist.
Stimulation by the pharmacological agonist, L-quisqualic acid (Q), led to a significant
increase in IP3 over vehicle-only (DMSO) treated W2- and D3-Grm1 cells; the increase was
abrogated by preincubation with the Grm1-receptor specific non-competitive antagonist
BAY 36-7620 (BAY). No significant responses were noted for empty-vector transfected
iBMK cells.

A. MAPK/ERK is activated by Grm1 agonist in both W2- and D3-Grm1 cells, as assessed
by immunoblotting, which demonstrated enhanced levels of phosphorylated ERK (pERK).
All functional stable W2 and D3-Grm1 lines responded similarly. Maximal activation was
seen within five minutes of induction by the agonist Q (10μM), as seen in this representative
immunoblot (D3-Grm1). Fold change in pERK relative to control, by densitometry.
B. MAPK/ERK activation is specific to Grm1. Pretreatment for 30 min with the Grm1specific antagonist BAY (10μM) inhibited phospho-ERK 1/2 signal increase by induction
with Q; examples of both W2-Grm1 and D3-Grm1 responses are shown here at the 5 min
time-point. Fold change in pERK relative to control, by densitometry.
C. AKT is specifically activated by Grm1 agonist in both W2- and D3-Grm1 cells as
assessed by immunoblotting. Again W2-Grm1 (not shown) and D3-Grm1 responses exactly
corresponded. In this representative immunoblot (D3-Grm1), maximal activation was seen
within ten minutes of induction by the agonist Q (10μM). Pretreatment with the Grm1specific antagonist BAY (10μM) for 30 min inhibited phospho-AKT signal induction by Q.
Fold change in pAKT relative to control, by densitometry.

A. Grm1-receptor ectopically expressed in W2 cells induces tumorigenicity in independent
clones (W2-Grm1). Average tumor size upon termination at 13 weeks after inoculation with
106 cells (n=20). No measurable tumors were ever observed from empty-vector transfected
cells (W2-vec) at this endpoint. Representative nude-mouse/tumor photographs, and
photomicrograph of typical H&E stained tumor section with blood vessel. Immunoblotting
demonstrated Grm1 expression in tissue excised from Grm1-iBMK tumors.
B. Grm1-receptor ectopically expressed in D3 cells increases tumorigenicity in independent
clones (D3-Grm1). At the endpoint, 8 weeks after inoculation with 106 cells (n=20), Grm1receptor expressing clones reached a mean tumor size over 1000 mm3, whereas D3-vec cell
tumors only averaged approximately one-fifth that volume (P < 0.001, ANOVA).
Representative nude-mouse/tumor photographs include closer view of tumor angiogenesis
visible through the skin as overt blood vessels, in addition to photomicrograph of H&E
stained section. Immunoblotting demonstrated Grm1 expression only in tissue from Grm1iBMK seeded tumors.

A. In cell culture tests, anti-Grm1 siRNA, but not anti-GFP control siRNA, constructs
introduced into iBMK-Grm1 cells permitted doxycycline-inducible knockdown of Grm1 at
the protein level as assessed by immunoblots. Grm1 expression as percentage of control, by
densitometry.
B. In vivo inhibition of tumor development by anti-Grm1 siRNA. Mice bearing allografted
tumors developing from W2- and D3-Grm1-siGrm1 cells from Fig. 4a were treated with
doxycycline (0.1% w/v in drinking water) to induce siRNA expression to knockdown levels
of Grm1. Results indicated sustained expression of Grm1 is necessary to maintain W2- and
D3-Grm1 tumor progression (respectively P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, t test, n=20). No
significant differences in tumor growth were observed between doxycycline treated and
untreated W2- and D3-Grm1-siGFP (control siRNA) mice.

Renal cell carcinoma cell lines release glutamate. At the time of measurement, 96 h, half the
volume of medium was removed for glutamate assay, and cell-viability immediately
assessed by MTT. Glutamate and MTT assays were performed in triplicate and
quadruplicate, respectively. A. Cell growth. Plot of increase in MTT absorbance relative to
Day 0 (set at 1 relative unit).
B. Glutamate release. μM Glu / absorbance. RCC lines achieved a several-fold increase in
extracellular glutamate over HEK293 cells even when adjusted for differences in growth
rate over the course of the experiment as measured by MTT.

Fig. 7. Renal cell carcinoma cells respond to the anti-glutamatergic drug riluzole

MTT cell proliferation-viability assays were performed after treatment of RCC cells with
riluzole for 96 h at 25μM. Two of the four RCC lines exhibited reduced cell proliferation in
the presence of riluzole: UOK115 by about 20%, and UOK117 by about 50% in comparison
to the control HEK293 cells (set at 1 relative unit).

Fig. 8. Riluzole can modulate RCC cell growth

Author Manuscript

A. Two out of four RCC lines examined displayed apparent cytostatic (UOK115) or
cytotoxic/apoptotic (UOK117) effects in the presence of riluzole, as previously observed in
melanoma cells [15]. For example, after treatment with riluzole (25μM) for 48 and 72 h, cell
cycle analyses showed an accumulation of UOK115 in G2/M (cytostasis), and a
considerable increase in UOK117 cells accumulated in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle,
indicating cellular apoptosis.
B. Apoptosis in UOK117 was corroborated by PARP cleavage as shown by immunoblot.
HEK293 cells were not affected by riluzole at this concentration. Ratio of cleaved to total
PARP by densitometry.

A. Anti-GRM1 siRNA constructs introduced into UOK117 RCC cells permitted
doxycycline-inducible knockdown of endogenous GRM1 at the protein level as assessed by
immunoblots. GRM1 + control is IMR32 cell extract. Levels of GRM1 expression in three
independent siGRM1-UOK117 clones as percentage of control Day 0, by densitometry.
B. In vivo reduction of tumor progression by anti-GRM1 siRNA. Mice bearing xenografted
tumors developing from two independent clones of siGRM1-UOK117 RCC cells chosen
from Fig. 9a were treated with doxycycline to induce siRNA knockdown of endogenous
GRM1 levels. Results implied sustained expression of GRM1 is in part necessary to
maintain UOK117 tumor progression (both clones P < 0.001, t test, n=20).
