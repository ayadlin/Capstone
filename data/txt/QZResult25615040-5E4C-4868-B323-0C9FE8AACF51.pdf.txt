BACKGROUND: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend that patients with surgically resected head and
neck cancers that have adverse pathologic features should receive adjuvant therapy in the form of radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT). To the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first analysis of temporal trends and use patterns of adjuvant therapy
for these patients. METHODS: Patients with head and neck cancer and adverse pathologic features were identified in the National
Cancer Data Base (1998-2011). Data were analyzed using chi-square, Student t, and log-rank tests; multivariate logistic regression;
and Cox multivariate regression. RESULTS: A total of 73,088 patients were identified: 41.5% had received adjuvant RT, 33.5% had
received adjuvant CRT, and 25.0% did not receive any adjuvant therapy. From 1998 to 2011, the increase in the use of adjuvant CRT
was greatest for patients with oral cavity (6-fold) and laryngeal (5-fold) cancers. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Medicare/
Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.11), distance 34 miles from the cancer center (OR,
1.66; 95% CI, 1.59-1.74), and academic (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.20-1.31) and high-volume (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15) centers were independently associated with patients not receiving adjuvant therapy. Receipt of adjuvant therapy was found to be independently associated
with improved overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 25% of patients are not receiving National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-directed adjuvant therapy. Patient-level and hospital-level factors are associated with variations in the receipt of adjuvant therapy. Further evaluation of these differences in practice patterns is needed to

INTRODUCTION
In 2013, there were 53,640 incident cases and 11,520 deaths in the United States attributed to head and neck cancer.1
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines currently recommend that patients with surgically
resected head and neck cancers that have adverse pathologic features should receive adjuvant therapy (Table 1).2 These
adverse features include positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension (ECE), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), pT3 to
pT4 primary tumors, and pN2 to pN3 lymph node disease. T3N0 to T3N1 laryngeal cancers without other adverse features were excluded because the guidelines do not recommend adjuvant therapy for patients with these cancers.2
Since the 1950s, the traditional modality of postoperative therapy for patients with locally advanced head and neck
cancer was radiotherapy (RT).3 However, in 2004, 2 randomized trials, the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22931 trial and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9501 trial, demonstrated that adjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) was more effective than postoperative RT alone in achieving locoregional
control.3-5 The EORTC 22931 trial4 demonstrated that adjuvant CRT was associated with improved overall survival
(OS), whereas the RTOG 9501 trial6 demonstrated an association with improved disease-free survival, but not OS. Currently, the NCCN guidelines state that postoperative CRT is either preferred or recommended for patients with ECE, but
should be considered as an alternative to adjuvant RT for patients with positive surgical margins, pT3 to T4 primary
tumors, pN2 to pN3 lymph node disease, LVI, and perineural invasion.2 To the best of our knowledge, there are a paucity

of data documenting the use of postoperative RT and
CRT in patients with head and neck cancer with adverse
pathologic features. No studies to date have examined
whether patient and hospital characteristics are associated
with the receipt of adjuvant therapy in this cohort.
To our knowledge, this is the first study of the temporal trends and usage patterns of adjuvant therapy for
patients with head and neck cancer with adverse features.
The objectives of the current study were 1) to identify
trends in the use of postoperative RT and CRT in patients
with adverse features, and 2) to determine patient-level
and hospital-level factors associated with deviation from
NCCN-recommended adjuvant therapy. We hypothe3354

sized that insurance status, hospital type, and hospital
location were associated with variation in the receipt of
adjuvant therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Study Participants

The data source for the current study was the National
Cancer Data Base (NCDB) from 1998 to 2011, which
includes patients from more than 1500 American College
of Surgeons Commission on Cancer-accredited programs.7
The NCDB is the largest disease-specific registry in the
country and covers approximately 70% of incident cases
of cancer in the United States.8

Adjuvant Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer/Chen et al

Patients with head and neck cancer were identified
using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition topography codes for oropharynx
(C09.0-C09.1, C09.8-C09.9, C10.0, C10.2-C10.4,
C10.8-C10.9, and C01.9), oral cavity (including lip)
(C00.0-C00.6, C00.8-C00.9, C02.0-C02.4, C02.8C03.1, C03.9-C04.1, C04.8-C05.2, C05.8-C06.2, and
C06.8-C06.9), hypopharynx (C12.9-C13.2 and C13.8C13.9), and larynx (C32.0-C32.3 and C32.8-C32.9).
Our inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients (age 18
years), neoplasms with in situ or invasive malignant
behavior, surgical resection, and any adverse pathologic
features (positive surgical margins, ECE, pT3-T4 primary
tumors, and pN2-N3 lymph node disease). Patients with
pT3N0 to pT3N1 laryngeal cancer without other adverse
features were excluded. We also excluded all cases in
which RT or CRT was not recommended due to contraindications or not administered due to patient death
before planned treatment or patient refusal. Due to the
small number of patients (1112 patients), we excluded
patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy alone.
Demographic variables included patient age, sex,
race, insurance status, comorbidity, and distance from the
center providing their head and neck cancer care. Age was
grouped into 4 categories: 55 years, 55 to 64 years, 65
to 74 years, and 75 years. Race was classified as white,
black, and other. Insurance status was the patient’s primary insurance at the time of diagnosis; it was grouped
into not insured, private/managed care, Medicare/Medicaid (including other government insurance), and
unknown. Comorbidity was based on the Charlson/Deyo
Comorbidity Score9 and classified as 0 (no comorbid conditions), 1 comorbidity, 2 comorbidities, and
unknown. Distance was the distance in miles between the
patient’s ZIP code centroid and the hospital’s ZIP code
centroid and was 0 if the patient lived within the same
ZIP code as the hospital. The ZIP code centroid is a point
near the center of a ZIP code area. Distance was classified
into <34 miles and 34 miles (highest quartile).
Socioeconomic status variables included income and
education data based on each patient’s home address.
Income was the estimated median income for the patient’s
ZIP code and was grouped into quartiles: <$30,000,
$30,000 to $35,000, $35,000 to $45,999, and
$46,000. Education was the percentage of adults in the
patient’s ZIP code who did not graduate from high school
and was classified into quartiles: 29, 20% to 28.9%,
14% to 19.9%, and <14%.
Hospital-level variables included hospital type, hospital volume, and region. Hospital type was categorized as
Cancer

November 1, 2014

community, academic, and other cancer programs. Highvolume centers were facilities with >51 cases (highest
quartile) and low-volume centers were those with 51
cases. Geographic region was grouped into 4 categories:
East, South, Midwest, and West.
Clinical and pathologic variables included adjuvant
therapy, pathologic stage of disease, surgical margins, positive lymph nodes, LVI, and ECE. Adjuvant therapy was
classified as no adjuvant therapy (surgery alone), adjuvant
RT, and adjuvant CRT. Pathologic T and N classifications were based on the American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) staging guidelines.10 Each patient was
staged based on the edition that corresponded to their
year of diagnosis, and therefore the 5th, 6th, and 7th editions of the AJCC guidelines were used. There were minor
changes in the T classification between the editions and
no changes in N classification. We aggregated patients
with T4a and T4b disease into T4 because the changes
across the editions included the division of T4 into T4a
and T4b. Surgical margins were dichotomized into positive and negative margins. Positive margins were defined
as <5 mm and margins were final margins after reexcision. Positive lymph nodes were categorized as no positive
lymph nodes, positive lymph nodes, and lymph nodes not
examined. LVI was defined the pathological identification
of LVI and classified as present or absent. LVI was only
available for cases diagnosed from 2010 onward. ECE was
defined as the presence or absence of lymph node ECE
and was only available for cases diagnosed between 2004
and 2011.
Our primary outcomes of interest were adherence to
recommended adjuvant therapy and OS. Survival time in
years was calculated from the date of diagnosis to death,
the last date the patient was known to be alive, or December 31, 2011, whichever came first. Survival data were
limited to cases diagnosed from 1998 to 2006.
Statistical Analysis

Bivariate analysis using the chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used for univariate analysis of survival, and the log-rank
test was used to determine statistical significance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with a lack of adjuvant therapy. Cox
proportional hazards regression was used to identify factors associated with OS. Odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios
(HR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for the strength of association. All tests were 2sided, and a P value <.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

The data analysis was performed using Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version
21.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Because all patient information was deidentified in the NCDB, the current study was
granted an exemption from the Institutional Review
Board of the study institution.
RESULTS
We identified 73,088 surgical patients with head and
neck cancer with adverse features (Table 2). Traditionally,
these patients should all have received postoperative RT.
The current NCCN guidelines recommend that these
patients receive either postoperative RT or CRT. The majority of the cohort in the current study received either adjuvant RT (41.5%) or CRT (33.5%). However, 25.0% of
the patients did not receive any recommended adjuvant
therapy.
Temporal Trends in Adjuvant Treatment and
Survival

From 1998 to 2011, there was an increase in the use of
postoperative CRT in the treatment of patients with head
and neck cancer with adverse pathologic features (Fig. 1).
The increase was greatest in patients with oral cavity (6fold increase) and laryngeal (5-fold increase) cancers.
There was a corresponding decrease in the use of postop3356

erative RT for all 4 head and neck cancer sites. The use of
surgery alone decreased for patients with oropharyngeal
and oral cavity cancers, but increased for patients with
hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers.
Over a similar time period, from 1998 to 2006, the
5-year OS improved for patients with oropharyngeal cancer but remained stable for those with oral cavity, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers (Fig. 2). Kaplan-Meier
analysis of OS across 4 year groups (1998-2000, 20012002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006) demonstrated a significant difference in survival for patients with oropharyngeal cancer (P <.001, log-rank test), but no difference in
survival for patients with cancers at other head and neck
sites.
Use of Adjuvant Therapy

Compared with those who received no adjuvant therapy
after surgery, patients who received adjuvant therapy were
more likely to be men (66.4% vs 75.1%; P <.001), aged
<65 years (46.4% vs 64.8%; P <.001), and to have no
comorbidities (46.5% vs 52.4%; P <.001) (Table 3).
Nearly one-half of patients treated with adjuvant therapy
(47.4%) were privately insured compared with 34.3% of
those who received no adjuvant therapy (P <.001).
Patients who underwent surgery without adjuvant therapy
were more likely to be treated at academic centers (54.2%

After multivariate analysis, Medicare/Medicaid insurance (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11), distance 34
miles from the hospital (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.59-1.74),
academic centers (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.20-1.31), highvolume centers (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15), and hospitals in the South (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32-1.47) and
West (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.33) were found to be independently associated with patients not receiving adjuvant therapy (Fig. 3). Patients who were older, female,
and had comorbidities were also less likely to receive adjuvant therapy. A subanalysis of only those cases diagnosed
from 2008 to 2011 demonstrated that these factors
remained independently associated with the lack of adjuvant therapy in the most recent time period.

According to the NCCN guidelines, postoperative
CRT is either preferred or recommended for patients with
ECE. A subanalysis of only those patients with ECE diagnosed between 2004 and 2011 demonstrated that 69.7%
received postoperative CRT, 16.8% received postoperative RT, and 13.6% received no postoperative therapy.
Survival Analysis

We also analyzed the association between adjuvant treatment and survival in all patients. After controlling for
disease site, T and N classification, age, sex, race, comor3358

bidities, socioeconomic characteristics, region, hospital
type, hospital volume, and year of diagnosis, we found
that adjuvant therapy was independently associated with
improved OS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.86). After
adjusting for demographic, clinical, pathologic, and
hospital-level variables, there was no difference in survival
noted between academic and community centers (HR,
1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03); however, high-volume centers
were associated with improved OS (HR, 0.95; 95% CI,
0.92-0.98).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
population-level analysis of trends and variations in the
use of adjuvant therapy for patients with head and neck
cancer with adverse pathologic features. All the patients in
the current study should have received adjuvant therapy,
with the most recent guidelines suggesting that CRT is
preferred for patients with ECE.2 Across all head and neck
cancer sites analyzed, we found that there was an increase
in the use of adjuvant CRT and a decrease in the use of adjuvant RT. In 1998, the majority of patients received adjuvant RT; however, by 2007, there were more patients
receiving adjuvant CRT than adjuvant RT alone for all

sites analyzed. Greater than 25% of the current study
cohort did not receive any adjuvant therapy and over 10%
of those with ECE did not receive adjuvant CRT. Older
age, female sex, more comorbidities, Medicare/Medicaid
insurance, distance 34 miles from the hospital, academic centers, and high-volume centers were associated
with deviation from NCCN-recommended treatment
guidelines with respect to the receipt of adjuvant therapy.
Adjuvant therapy was found to be independently associated with survival, but there was no difference in survival
noted between academic and community centers.
Since the landmark studies by Bernier et al4 and
Cooper et al6 demonstrating the benefit of postoperative
CRT for patients with locally advanced head and neck
cancer, there has been a growing interest in the use of multimodality therapy for the treatment of head and neck
cancer. We observed that the percentage of patients receiving adjuvant CRT has increased steadily since 1998. By
2007, adjuvant CRT overtook adjuvant RT as the primary mode of postoperative therapy in all sites. Prior
studies on the nonsurgical management of patients with
oropharyngeal cancer11 and laryngeal cancer12 have demonstrated a similar increase in the use of CRT. We did not
observe a corresponding increase in survival over a similar
time frame, except among patients with oropharyngeal
cancer. The improvement in survival in patients with oropharyngeal cancer is likely due to the changing etiology of
the disease and the increasing prevalence of human
papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancers.13
Compared with privately insured patients, patients
in the current study cohort with Medicare/Medicaid insurance were less likely to receive adjuvant therapy. Similar results have been shown in the surgical oncology
literature. In a study of 6734 patients with breast cancer,
Wu et al determined that Medicaid insurance (OR, 0.66;
95% CI, 0.50-0.86) was a strong independent predictor
of non-NCCN guideline-recommended chemotherapy.14
Bristow et al analyzed 47,160 patients with ovarian cancer
and reported that Medicare payer status was associated
with an increased odds of not receiving NCCN guidelineadherent care (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.12-1.28).15
We found that patients with head and neck cancer
who lived 34 miles (highest quartile group) from the
hospital were less likely to receive adjuvant therapy compared with those who lived closer to the hospital. This barrier to use has been shown in other cancer populations. A
recent study by Huang et al analyzed patients with colorectal cancer and demonstrated that increasing distance
from a National Cancer Institute center, in increments of
5 miles, was associated with the decreased use of National

Cancer Institute centers for their cancer care (OR, 0.93;
95% CI, 0.93-0.94).16 A survey of patient compliance
with hormonal therapy for prostate cancer by Shaheen
et al identified that long travel distances to the clinic contributed to poor patient compliance.17
We demonstrated that patients treated at academic
medical centers and high-volume centers were less likely
to receive adjuvant therapy than those treated at community centers and low-volume centers. We did not find a
difference in OS between academic and community centers, but high-volume centers had improved OS compared
with low-volume centers. Possible characteristics of highvolume centers that may lead to improved OS and the
decreased use of adjuvant therapy include appropriate
nonadministration of adjuvant therapy in the setting of
comorbidities or relative contraindications. The results of
the current study suggest that there may be other unmeasured characteristics of high-volume centers that are associated with the decreased use of adjuvant therapy and
increased OS. Similarly, Sharma et al analyzed 1195 Medicare patients with advanced head and neck cancer and
concluded that high hospital volume was not associated
with receiving NCCN guideline-adherent multimodality
therapy (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.66-1.60), but demonstrated a nearly significant association with OS (HR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.69-1.04).18 In addition, Sharma et al
reported that patients at high-volume centers were more
likely to receive surgery alone than those at low-volume
centers (12% vs 9%). The data from the current study
support these results by demonstrating that patients
treated at high-volume centers were less likely to receive
adjuvant therapy than those treated at low-volume centers. In the urology literature, Williams et al reported that
patients treated by high-volume surgeons were less likely
to receive adjuvant therapy (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.460.78).19 A meta-analysis of 17 studies reported that highvolume hospitals (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96) and
high-volume surgeons (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92)
were associated with improved OS among patients with
head and neck cancer.20
Limitations to the current study include those inherent to database analysis, such as possible misclassification
and coding errors. The socioeconomic data used in the
current analysis were ZIP code-based rather than individualized data. T and N classification was based on the edition of the AJCC guidelines that corresponded to the year
of diagnosis, and therefore there may be minor mismatches in the staging depending on the edition that was
used (5th, 6th, or 7th). We do not have data available
regarding smoking status and Gillison et al have
3359

Original Article

demonstrated that there has been a trend toward decreasing overall tobacco exposure among smokers with head
and neck cancer.21 We controlled for these temporal
trends by adjusting for the year of diagnosis in our survival
analysis. The NCDB does not include information
regarding reoperation, disease recurrence, detailed patient
comorbidity data beyond the Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score, perineural invasion, or disease-specific survival.
However, we were able to provide a national perspective
on trends and variations in the use of postoperative CRT
and RT among patients with head and neck cancer.
Conclusions

The use of adjuvant CRT for head and neck cancer has
increased dramatically over the past 13 years. Current
NCCN guidelines recommend adjuvant therapy for patients
with head and neck cancer with adverse pathologic features;
however, greater than one-quarter of these patients are not
receiving adjuvant therapy. The current study has identified
patient-level characteristics that are associated with the
receipt of adjuvant therapy, suggesting that insurance status
and a greater distance from head and neck cancer care centers
may serve as barriers to receiving guideline-based care. Academic and high-volume centers have lower rates of adjuvant
therapy, demonstrating heterogeneity in physician practices.
Further evaluation of the underlying etiologies of these differences in practice patterns is needed to standardize practice
patterns and potentially improve the quality of care received
by patients with head and neck cancer.
