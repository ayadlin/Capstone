A Road Map to Comprehensive Androgen Receptor Axis
Targeting for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Nicholas Mitsiades

Abstract
Gonadal androgen suppression (castration via orchiectomy or gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues)
suppresses circulating testosterone levels but does not achieve adequate androgen ablation within the prostate
cancer microenvironment because it does not address adrenal and intratumoral steroid contributions. These
residual extragonadal sources of androgens allow prostate cancer cells to survive, adapt, and evolve into
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The persistent signiﬁcance of the androgen receptor (AR) axis in
CRPC was recently validated by the clinical efﬁcacy of androgen synthesis inhibitors (abiraterone) and novel,
second-generation AR antagonists (enzalutamide). The appreciation that conventional therapeutic approaches
achieve a suboptimal ablation of intratumoral androgens and AR axis signaling output opens transformative
therapeutic opportunities. A treatment paradigm of comprehensive AR axis targeting at multiple levels
(androgen synthesis, metabolism, and action) and at all relevant sites (gonadal, adrenal, intratumoral)
simultaneously at the time of initiation of endocrine therapy (instead of the current approach of sequentially
adding one agent at a time and only after disease progression) deserves examination in clinical trials to explore
whether maximal ﬁrst-line AR axis suppression via combination therapy can achieve maximal induction of
cancer cell apoptosis (before they have the chance to adapt and evolve into CRPC) and thus, improve patient
outcomes. Cancer Res; 73(15); 4599–605. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that
plays critical roles in prostate adenocarcinoma pathophysiology (1). Gonadal androgen suppression [surgical or chemical castration via orchiectomy or gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) analogues, respectively] is an effective
systemic treatment for advanced prostate cancer in use for
the past 7 decades (2). However, it is not curative, as, almost
universally, resistant disease eventually emerges, which had
been described in the past as "hormone-refractory" and
"androgen-independent" prostate cancer (1). These terms
have now been conﬁrmed to be inaccurate, as AR and its
transcriptional output most frequently remain expressed
and critically important in prostate cancer cells even in this
state (1), leading to the adoption of the more appropriate
term, "castration-resistant" prostate cancer (CRPC). The
latter indicates a clinical state in which, despite suppressed
circulating testosterone levels (<50 ng/dL), the AR axis has

been reactivated because of a plethora of signaling mechanisms that operate within the prostate cancer cell and its local
milieu (1). This revised view of the persistent role of AR
signaling in CRPC led to the development of novel therapeutic agents such as the androgen synthesis inhibitor
abiraterone (3) and the second-generation AR antagonist
enzalutamide (MDV3100; ref. 4), and, in turn, was validated
by their clinical efﬁcacy.

Mechanisms Promoting Persistent AR Axis
Output in CRPC and Clinical Validation of Its
Signiﬁcance
Several mechanisms that promote persistent AR axis activation in CRPC cells, despite castrate levels of peripheral testosterone, have been reported (Fig. 1), including the following:

Persistence of intratumoral androgens via in situ synthesis
and metabolism (refs. 5–11; and discussed in more detail
below);
AR overexpression (frequently due to AR gene
ampliﬁcation) and missense mutations in the AR ligandbinding domain (LBD) that sensitize the receptor to even
low androgen concentrations and/or broaden ligand
speciﬁcity, leading to promiscuous interactions with
alternative ligands (e.g., progesterone or the ﬁrstgeneration AR antagonists, ﬂutamide, bicalutamide, and
nilutamide, that can be converted into agonists under
these conditions; refs. 1, 12–16);

Comprehensive AR Axis Targeting for Prostate Cancer

Expression of AR variants that lack the LBD and can
signal in a ligand-independent, constitutively active
manner (17–18);
Stoichiometric and qualitative changes in the coregulatory
components of the AR complex, including the AR
coactivators and corepressors that modulate the
transcriptional response. For example, all three steroid
receptor coactivators (SRC) of the p160 family (SRC-1,
SRC-2, and SRC-3) have been reported to be overexpressed
in prostate cancer and this is linked to inferior clinical
outcomes (1, 19–21). In particular for SRC-2, encoded by
NCOA2, gene ampliﬁcations and point mutations have
been detected in prostate cancer and are associated with
increased AR transcriptional activity (22); and
Activation of the AR complex via cross-talk with other
signaling pathways, such as HER2, insulin-like growth
factor-1 receptor, Src, and Akt pathways that
phosphorylate AR or its coactivators (1, 21, 23–26).

These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and several of
them may operate simultaneously in CRPC cells and synergistically enhance AR transcriptional output (1).
Collectively, these ﬁndings support the role of the AR axis
as an important therapeutic target in CRPC and led to the
development of novel second-line endocrine therapies for
prostate cancer. The CYP17 enzymatic inhibitor abiraterone
prolonged median overall survival in men with chemotherapyrefractory CRPC by 3.9 months (3) and also showed clinical
activity in chemotherapy-na€ve CRPC (27), thus validating
the importance of residual intratumoral androgens in CRPC
pathophysiology. The second-generation AR antagonist
enzalutamide (MDV3100; ref. 4), which was rationally designed
to overcome the antagonist-to-agonist conversion of ﬁrst-generation AR antagonists (28), prolonged median overall survival
in men with chemotherapy-refractory CRPC by 4.8 months (4)
and is currently being tested in chemotherapy-na€ve CRPC.

In Situ Steroid Synthesis and Metabolism in
CRPC
Several groups have reported that, compared with primary
prostate cancers or normal prostate tissue, CRPC exhibits
increased expression of enzymes involved in androgen synthesis and substantial tissue androgen levels that should be
sufﬁcient to stimulate AR (and may be even higher than levels
present within primary prostate cancers from untreated eugonadal men; refs. 5–11). Collectively, these ﬁndings raise the
hypothesis that, despite peripheral castration, prostate cancer
cells may never (yet) encounter a completely androgen-free
local milieu, and that the term "androgen deprivation therapy"
that is frequently used to describe ﬁrst-line therapy with GnRH

analogues or orchiectomy may actually be a misnomer (at least
at the level of the tumor microenvironment). The clinical
efﬁcacy of the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone validates this
hypothesis.
In a recent comprehensive integrated oncogenomic analysis of primary and metastatic prostate cancer specimens, we
documented aberrant expression of enzymes involved in
androgen synthesis and metabolism. As a group, metastatic
prostate cancers expressed higher average transcript levels for
AR and several steroidogenic enzymes, including SRD5A1,
SRD5A3, and AKR1C3, whereas expression of SRD5A2, CYP3A4,
CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 was decreased (11). The latter three
enzymes are involved in phase I of dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
inactivation (oxidation), and their decreased expression is
predicted to increase in situ androgen levels and enhance AR
activation. More importantly, we detected high intertumor
variability of expression of individual enzyme transcripts in
primary and metastatic prostate cancers, raising the hypothesis that within each individual tumor, enhanced activation of
the androgen axis may occur at the level of a different enzyme,
but with a common end result, i.e., increased tissue androgen
levels and stimulation of AR (11).
These data thus highlight the androgen synthesis pathway
en block as a mechanism of CRPC resistance to androgen
deprivation therapy and can help explain the signiﬁcant variability between lists of upregulated enzymes found in prior
studies (5, 9, 29). One related question has been whether CRPC
metastatic sites express the complete panel of enzymes necessary for de novo steroidogenesis using cholesterol as a
precursor. Although it is generally accepted that prostate
cancers can locally convert adrenal precursors to more active
androgens (testosterone and DHT) via their own AKR1C3 and
5a-reductase (SRD5A1; 29), it has been proposed that they lack
adequate CYP17A1 expression, and as a result, they remain
dependent on the contribution of adrenal precursors (as a twosite, "adrenal-prostate cancer" steroidogenic unit; ref. 29). In
our study, we found that this is the case for the majority, but not
all, prostate cancers. A small subset of prostate cancers overexpresses CYP11A1, CYP17A1, 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B1), HSD3B2, and STAR (which are necessary for
the conversion of cholesterol to androstenedione), and thus
may be self-sufﬁcient for de novo steroidogenesis (11).

Mechanisms of Dysregulated Androgen
Metabolism in Prostate Cancer: Does Acute
Adaptation Precede (and Allow for) Clonal
Selection?
The mechanism(s) underlying this aberrant expression in
CRPC of transcripts involved in androgen metabolism remain
(s) to be fully characterized. Obviously, the full elucidation of

Figure 1. Mechanisms of persistent AR transcriptional activity in CRPC cells and target sites of therapeutic agents: extragonadal (adrenal and/or intratumoral)
steroidogenesis can serve as a source of residual intratumoral androgens (A). AR overexpression (frequently due to AR gene ampliﬁcation) and/or
AR LBD mutations (B) can increase sensitivity to low androgen levels and/or broaden ligand speciﬁcity, leading to promiscuous activation with
alternative ligands. Constitutively active AR variants lacking the LBD, for example, alternatively spliced variants, can signal in a ligand-independent manner (C).
Other mechanisms include changes in expression and posttranslational modiﬁcation of AR coactivators and corepressors and enhanced activation of the
AR complex via cross-talk with other growth and survival pathways (e.g., kinases/phosphatases, acetyltransferases/deacetylases, etc). mtAR, mutant AR
(LBD mutation); tAR, truncated AR (constitutively active); wtAR, wild-type AR (full length).

these mechanisms could reveal novel therapeutic targets for
inhibition of the AR axis in CRPC. In our study of integrated
gene expression and comparative genomic hybridization datasets, these aberrant expression patterns were only rarely
associated with respective copy-number alterations (CNA;
ref. 11). On the contrary, AR overexpression was, in agreement
with previous studies (13), frequently associated with AR gene
ampliﬁcation, an event that possibly would require a process of
clonal selection. In the absence of frequent CNAs, we examined
whether the dysregulation of androgen metabolism enzymes
occurs at the mRNA level (11). Expression of several enzyme
transcripts, in particular of the AKR1C family, is induced by
androgen deprivation (11, 30) within a timeframe (24–48
hours) that is too fast for clonal selection. Conversely, androgen treatment can suppress the expression of steroidogenic
enzymes. The ﬁnding that androgen deprivation rapidly upregulates the mRNA levels of AKR1C3, an enzyme that can
convert androstenedione to testosterone, raises the hypothesis
that androgen deprivation triggers an acute adaptation feedback loop that enhances the ability of the prostate cancer cell
to metabolize adrenal precursors into testosterone and DHT,
thus sustaining tissue androgen levels and AR stimulation.
This hypothesis is also consistent with studies of neoadjuvant medical castration therapy in men with localized prostate
cancer that exhibited suboptimal suppression of intratumoral
androgens (by only about 70%–80%, in contrast with the >90%
concomitant reduction in serum androgens) and AR-dependent gene expression (31–32), suboptimal induction of prostate cancer apoptosis (33), and disappointingly low rates of
pathologic complete response (<3%; ref. 34). Once again, the
term "androgen-deprivation therapy" may be misleading, as it
overestimates the impact of the systemic treatment on androgen levels and the AR axis within the tumor microenvironment
(5–10). Instead, a noncommittal term such as "medical castration therapy" would be more appropriate.

Combination-Based Endocrine Therapy for
Prostate Cancer: Finally Moving Beyond
Proof-of-Concept
The appreciation of the importance of extragonadal contributions to AR signaling in prostate cancer is not recent.
Second- and third-line hormonal manipulations have previously been used in CRPC, yielding small successes that provided proof-of-principle. Efforts to suppress adrenal steroids
by surgical adrenalectomy and hypophysectomy date back 5
decades with anecdotal responses reported. Glucocorticoids,
via suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone and adrenal
androgen synthesis, also have documented activity in CRPC
with reported prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) responses as
high as approximately 60% in small phase II studies. Chemical
adrenalectomy with aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole has
provided PSA responses, but a survival beneﬁt was never
formally shown. The concept of adding an antiandrogen to
gonadal suppression for "combined androgen blockade" or
"maximal androgen blockade" has been proposed before
(35). However, clinical trials conducted in the pre-abiraterone/pre-enzalutamide era had failed to show a consistent,

4602

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

clinically meaningful beneﬁt from the addition of a ﬁrstgeneration antiandrogen (or any other second-line hormonal
agent) to gonadal suppression (a meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials including a total of 8,275 patients revealed, at best, a
nonsigniﬁcant gain of 1.8% in 5-year survival; ref. 36). Similarly,
despite a very strong preclinical rationale, a use for 5a-reductase inhibitors has not yet been found in CRPC (although the
combination of dutasteride with ketoconazole and hydrocortisone provided promising PSA responses in a recent study;
ref. 37).
So why did abiraterone and enzalutamide achieve a survival
beneﬁt, whereas earlier second-line hormonal approaches did
not? This could be because of more effective targeting of
androgen synthesis and AR LBD, respectively, with fewer side
effects. Abiraterone is a more speciﬁc and better-tolerated
inhibitor of steroidogenesis than aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole. Enzalutamide seems to lack the AR agonistic effects
of ﬁrst-generation antiandrogens. With these advanced therapeutic agents in our armamentarium now, and with a galvanized interest in the AR axis as a therapeutic target in prostate
cancer, the next steps will be to optimize their use for maximal
therapeutic beneﬁt. For example, the best timing, setting, and
sequence for these novel agents to maximize clinical beneﬁt
and minimize the risk of cross-resistance remain to be deﬁned.

The "Androgenic Set Point" of Prostate Cancer
Cells and Maintenance of Cell Survival
In studies of neoadjuvant medical castration therapy, the
probability of early biochemical recurrence was inversely
correlated with the degree of pathologic effect (38) and positively correlated with the residual expression of AR-dependent
genes, including PSA, identiﬁed as early as 3 months after the
initiation of hormonal therapy (39). Therefore, failure to adequately suppress the AR axis (or early reactivation of AR
signaling) is associated with inferior clinical outcomes.
Short-term (24–48 hours) exposure of prostate cancer cells
to androgen-depleted medium in vitro stimulates the expression of steroidogenic enzymes (11, 30), AR itself (30, 40), and its
coactivators (19, 41). In the case of the AR gene, it has been
found that agonist-bound AR protein negatively regulates
gene transcription via recruitment of the histone demethylase
and transcriptional corepressor lysine-speciﬁc demethylase 1
(LSD1) to a highly conserved site in the second AR gene intron
(30). Similar LSD1-dependent mechanisms have been reported
for the rapid androgen-mediated downregulation of the steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 by agonist-bound AR (30). Collectively, these data suggest that agonist-bound AR directly
mediates a physiologic intracellular feedback loop to negatively regulate AR axis activity. Conversely, androgen withdrawal is proposed to trigger an acute adaptive response as a
preprogrammed attempt of the prostate cancer cells to retain
AR transcriptional activity, restoring it toward a predetermined "androgenic set point," which is critical for their survival.
According to this hypothesis, these adaptive cellular responses
would allow a sizeable pool of prostate cancer cells to maintain
adequate intratumoral androgen levels and AR axis activity
and survive, despite peripheral castrate androgen levels,

Comprehensive AR Axis Targeting for Prostate Cancer

eventually leading to the emergence of castration-resistant
disease (possibly after later acquiring clonal genetic lesions,
such as AR gene ampliﬁcation).
Therefore, as current approaches achieve a suboptimal
inhibition of AR signaling output, a more comprehensive AR
axis targeting at multiple levels (androgen synthesis, metabolism, and action) and at all relevant sites (gonadal, adrenal,
intratumoral) simultaneously at the time of initiation of endocrine therapy, deserves examination in clinical trials to explore
whether it can improve patient outcomes over the current
treatment paradigm of sequentially adding one agent at a time
and only after disease progression.

Personal Opinion: What Will the Landscape of
Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment Be in the
Next 5 Years?
The road map to comprehensive AR axis targeting
The above concepts lay the framework for new directions in
the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Both CYP17 inhibitors and second-generation AR antagonists are being tested
in pre-CRPC disease states (hormone-na€ve advanced prostate
cancer and in the neoadjuvant setting), and it is reasonable to
anticipate that they will be active there as well, by enhancing
the efﬁcacy of conventional medical castration therapy. In
addition, the consecutive use of these agents, including identifying the optimal sequencing approach to augment clinical
beneﬁt and minimize the risk of cross-resistance, remains to be
established by clinical evidence (so far, the phase III clinical
trials of both abiraterone and enzalutamide have excluded
patients previously treated with the other agent).
It is my personal opinion that the most promising approach
would be the early application of combination systemic therapy at the initiation of medical castration rather than after the
onset of CRPC. Combinations of both classes of agents with
GnRH analogs are being explored in clinical trials, and I am
optimistic that as part of a frontline comprehensive AR axistargeting approach, they could move us closer to our goal of a
completely androgen-free prostate cancer microenvironment.
Further toward that goal, additional steroidogenic enzymes are
being explored as therapeutic targets: inhibitors of AKR1C3
(42–45), HSD3B1 and HSD3B2, and SRD5A1 would also be
interesting choices to be included in future clinical trials of
multidrug combination regimens aiming at maximal frontline
inhibition of the AR axis to augment prostate cancer cell
apoptosis and deplete the pool of surviving prostate cancer
cells that can later accumulate additional genetic events and
resurge as CRPC.
Additional future directions
Several other CYP17 inhibitors (TAK-700/orteronel) and AR
antagonists (ARN-509) are in clinical development. Galeterone
(TOK-001 or VN/124-1) has been reported to be a CYP17
inhibitor, an AR antagonist, and also to promote AR degradation. Additional exciting opportunities have emerged in the
ﬁeld of combining AR axis–targeting agents with inhibitors
of other oncogenic signaling pathways. For example, recent
data suggest that AR inhibition derepresses phosphoinositide

www.aacrjournals.org

3-kinase/Akt signaling (46), thus providing a strong rationale
for combinations of inhibitors of both pathways.
Emerging technical developments can also address present needs in this ﬁeld: Accurate, standardized, inexpensive
assays with a reasonably rapid turnaround time for measurement of intratumoral steroids and AR signaling output
(e.g., in biopsy material) will help select patients and guide
therapy with these novel agents. Furthermore, interpatient
variations in intracrine steroid signaling can be evaluated
by noninvasive, real-time monitoring of the expression of AR
(full-length and alternatively spliced constitutively active
variants) and steroidogenic enzymes in circulating tumor
cells (CTC; ref. 11) and serve as potential basis for individualized therapy.
Unanswered questions
The advances in the ﬁeld of AR targeting in prostate cancer
have opened new opportunities and, simultaneously, generated new questions. Despite their documented clinical activity,
neither CYP17 inhibitors (abiraterone) nor second-generation
AR antagonists (enzalutamide) are curative as single agents (at
least in the clinical states in which they have been tested so
far), and refractory disease eventually develops. Although the
mechanisms of resistance (de novo or acquired) to these novel
agents are not yet fully studied, it is of critical signiﬁcance that
these refractory tumors usually continue to produce PSA (at
least to some degree). Because PSA (KLK3) gene expression
requires AR transcriptional activity, this preliminary observation (which needs to be supported by more comprehensive
gene expression proﬁling analyses in the near future) suggests
that the AR axis remains active (at least to some degree) even
after treatment with these novel AR-targeting agents. In the
case of abiraterone, preclinical models of resistance have
suggested that abiraterone treatment upregulates the expression of AR (both full-length and splice variants; ref. 47) and
several steroidogenic enzymes, including CYP17A1 (abiraterone's own target) and AKR1C3 (47–48), and promotes in situ
accumulation of pregnenolone and progesterone (that are
synthesized upstream of CYP17; ref. 48). Pregnenolone and
progesterone are putative AR agonists (especially in the case of
AR harboring certain LBD mutations; ref. 48). These putative
mechanisms of resistance to CYP17 inhibitors, which await
conﬁrmation in clinical specimens, suggest that despite treatment with these agents, some intratumoral steroids persist and
may be available to drive AR activity. This lends further
rationale to combinations of CYP17 inhibitors with other
enzymatic inhibitors (e.g., of AKR1C3) or with potent second-generation AR antagonists (e.g., enzalutamide). The constitutively active AR splice variants have been proposed as
mechanisms of resistance to both abiraterone (47) and enzalutamide (49) and will need to be addressed in the future with a
new treatment paradigm.
Other important questions in this ﬁeld include the
following:
*

What are the mechanisms underlying the feedback loops
that lead to the increased expression of steroidogenic
enzymes in CRPC? What other transcription factors, beyond

AR, control this process, and can they possibly serve as
therapeutic targets in the future?
What is the role of the bone microenvironment in in situ
steroidogenesis in prostate cancer metastasis?
Steroidogenic enzyme expression has been reported in the
epithelial compartment (carcinoma cells), via
immunohistochemistry in tissues (1) and quantitative realtime PCR in CTCs (11), implying capacity for cellautonomous steroidogenesis and intracrine signaling.
However, steroidogenic enzyme expression has also been
reported in the stroma, suggesting that (at least some)
enzymatic reactions may occur outside the prostate cancer
cell, in a two-compartment model involving paracrine
signaling. Moreover, can the bone microenvironment
promote steroidogenesis in prostate cancer cells at the
metastatic site? Conversely, what is the impact of high local
tissue androgen levels on bone remodeling in prostate
cancer bone metastasis?
What is the role of other steroids (e.g., progesterone,
mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids) and their nuclear
receptors (PR, MR, GR, respectively) in CRPC?
Although generally the importance of the overexpression of
steroidogenic enzymes for CRPC is attributed to increased
androgen synthesis, what other, nonendocrine roles may
these enzymes play? For example, several of these enzymes
may have roles in drug detoxiﬁcation, prostaglandin
metabolism, N-linked glycosylation, etc.

Conclusions
On the basis of the clinical activity of CYP17 inhibitors and
enzalutamide, AR is now a validated therapeutic target in

CRPC. Still, however, current treatment approaches do not
achieve complete inhibition of AR signaling in prostate
cancer because they do not address all aspects of this axis
(androgen synthesis, metabolism, and action) and all relevant sites (gonadal, adrenal, intratumoral) early enough in
the course of hormonal therapy. Failure to adequately and
comprehensively inhibit the AR axis may allow prostate
cancer cells to survive, adapt, and evolve into CRPC. There
is a need and opportunity to explore in clinical trials a new
paradigm in the management of advanced prostate cancer:
ﬁrst-line regimens based on combinations of new-generation inhibitors of all these AR axis components.
