ABSTRACT
Therapeutic success of VEGF-based anti-angiogenic tumor therapy is limited
due to resistance. Thus, new strategies for anti-angiogenic cancer therapy based on
novel targets are urgently required. Our previous in vitro work suggested that small
molecule Cdk5 inhibitors affect angiogenic processes such as endothelial migration
and proliferation. Moreover, we recently uncovered a substantial role of Cdk5 in the
development of lymphatic vessels. Here we pin down the in vivo impact of endothelial
Cdk5 inhibition in angiogenesis and elucidate the underlying mechanism in order
to judge the potential of Cdk5 as a novel anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer target.
By the use of endothelial-specific Cdk5 knockout mouse models and various endothelial
and tumor cell based assays including human tumor xenograft models, we show
that endothelial-specific knockdown of Cdk5 results in excessive but non-productive
angiogenesis during development but also in tumors, which subsequently leads to
inhibition of tumor growth. As Cdk5 inhibition disrupted Notch function by reducing
the generation of the active Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Cdk5 modulates
Notch-dependent endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting, we propose that the
Dll4/Notch driven angiogenic signaling hub is an important and promising mechanistic
target of Cdk5. In fact, Cdk5 inhibition can sensitize tumors to conventional
anti-angiogenic treatment as shown in tumor xenograft models. In summary our
data set the stage for Cdk5 as a drugable target to inhibit Notch-driven angiogenesis
condensing the view that Cdk5 is a promising target for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

anti-VEGF biologics (Bevacizumab) or small molecule
inhibitors (Sorafenib, Sunitinib) are given clinically
[1]. Unfortunately, non-responsiveness or resistance to
anti-angiogenic treatment and subsequent tumor
recurrence and metastasis limit therapeutic success
[2]. Thus, finding new strategies for anti-angiogenic
therapy represents an important and challenging
objective in cancer research.

Inhibition of angiogenesis has shown clinical
efficacy and represents a valid approach in cancer
therapy. Patients benefit from the combination of
chemotherapeutics or radiation with angiogenesis
inhibitors. The VEGF pathway is currently the
predominant target for anti-angiogenic therapy and

In this context, the Dll4/Notch pathway has
emerged as an interesting target. In physiological
angiogenesis, Dll4/Notch signaling regulates VEGFinduced vessel sprouting and branching and defines tip
and stalk cell specification [3]. In tumors, activation
of the Notch pathway promotes tumor growth [4] and
mediates resistance to chemotherapy [5]. Of note, the
disruption of Dll4/Notch signaling results in inhibition
of tumor growth [4–8] and was associated with excessive
but non-productive angiogenesis and impaired tumor
vessel perfusion [6, 7]. Consequently, the blockade of
the Dll4/Notch pathway is considered as a promising
option for anti-angiogenic treatment. In fact, γ-secretase
inhibitors or anti-Dll4/anti-Notch biologics are currently
being evaluated in open clinical trials for cancer therapy
[9, 10]. Furthermore, preclinical models indicated that
the combination of targeting the Dll4/Notch pathway and
anti-VEGF treatment leads to synergistic tumor growth
inhibitory effects [5, 8]. However, little is known about
the regulation of Dll4/Notch in tumor angiogenesis
[9]. Moreover, the chemosensitization by combination
therapies to overcome resistance to anti-angiogenic
treatment demands more attention in order to develop new
treatment strategies.
In this respect the protein kinase cyclin dependent
kinase 5 (Cdk5) represents a particular interesting potential
target to explore. Cdk5 is a serine/threonine kinase that
is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS)
and is essential for neuronal development and function
[11–13], but its role in the periphery and in cancer is not
well explored. During the recent years, the awareness
about roles of Cdk5 besides the CNS has grown. Cdk5
is expressed in various non-neuronal tissues [14–16] and
has been implicated in various types of cancer including
pancreatic [17–19], prostate [20, 21], thyroid [22, 23],
glioma [24], pituitary [25], breast [26], lung [27], ovarian
[28], and hepatocellular [29] cancers affecting various
targets such as retinoblastoma protein and downstream
cell cycle regulators [22, 23], the PIKE-A-Akt pathway
[24], Ras-Ral signaling [17], or DNA damage response
[29]. Further, by applying cell-based assays, our former
studies demonstrated that small molecule Cdk5 inhibitors
exert anti-angiogenic properties [30, 31] and that Cdk5
regulates endothelial cell migration [32] which was
restricted to in vitro assays. However, to nail down the
in vivo significance of Cdk5 in the endothelium, we have
recently generated constitutive and inducible endothelialspecific Cdk5 knockout mouse models, elucidating an
indispensable requirement of Cdk5 for lymphatic vessel
development and function [33].
Here, by using the endothelial-specific Cdk5
knockout mouse models, endothelial and tumor cells, and
human tumor xenografts, we investigate the heretofore
unknown in vivo function of Cdk5 in the blood vessel
endothelium. Moreover, the contribution of endothelial
Cdk5 to tumor angiogenesis and the underlying mechanism
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

such as the Dll4/Notch driven angiogenic signaling are
important subjects of this work.

RESULTS
Inhibition of Cdk5 in the endothelium induces
hypervascularization
As also shown in our former study [33], Cdk5 is
ubiquitously expressed in the endothelium (Figure 1A).
Specific disruption of Cdk5 in the mouse endothelium
using the Cre/loxP system [33] changed blood vessel
patterning during development, whereas, as we could
show previously, blood vessel morphology was not
affected [33]. In detail, constitutive knockdown of
endothelial Cdk5 with the Tie2Cre promoter [33]
induced hypervascularization of yolk sacs and
skin of Cdk5fl/flTie2Cre embryos (Figure 1B, 1C).
Consistent with these effects, postnatal knockdown
of endothelial Cdk5 with a tamoxifen-inducible
VE-Cadherin Cre promoter (Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2, i.e.
VECCre [33, 34]) (Supplementary Figure 1A) resulted in
hypervascularization of the developing retina (Figure 1D).
Moreover, hypervascularization of retinae of pups treated
with the small molecule Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine
demonstrated pharmacological accessibility of Cdk5
(Figure 1E). In sum, phenotyping of endothelial specific
knockout mouse models revealed an important role of
Cdk5 in blood vessel development.

Endothelial knockdown of Cdk5 reduces
tumor growth by promoting non-productive
angiogenesis
To examine the influence of endothelial Cdk5 on
tumor growth, a syngeneic tumor model was applied.
Tumor growth of subcutaneously implanted B16F1
melanoma cells was reduced in Cdk5fl/flVECCre mice
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 1B). Analysis of
tumor angiogenesis revealed that the number of vessels was
increased in tumors of Cdk5fl/flVECCre mice (Figure 2B).
Interestingly, tumor vessels from Cdk5fl/flVECCre mice
were smaller in comparison to tumor vessels from control
littermates (Figure 2B). Moreover, reduced smooth muscle
cell (SMC) coverage of vessels from Cdk5 knockdown
tumors demonstrated an increased incidence of immature
vessels (Figure 2C). Finally, the functionality of tumor
vessels was assessed by visualizing the ability of tumor
vessels to perfuse FITC-lectin. Whereas control mice
tumors displayed predominant overlap of FITC-lectin and
CD31 staining, tumor vessels from Cdk5fl/flVECCre mice
were much less perfused (Figure 2D). This set of data
indicates that the deletion of endothelial Cdk5 promotes
non-productive angiogenesis, which resulted in reduced
tumor growth.

Cdk5 regulates the Notch pathway in the
endothelium

that Cdk5 provides negative tonus on Notch-dependent
signaling.

Although various targets of Cdk5 have been
described in cancer and endothelial cells, as one mechanism
by which Cdk5 might regulate tumor angiogenesis,
the Notch pathway particularly attracted our attention
since the phenotype of endothelial Cdk5 knockout mice
resembles that of mice with defective Dll4/Notch signaling
[3]. In fact, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Cdk5
in endothelial cells (HUVECs) impaired Dll4-induced
Notch downstream target expression (Figure 3A, 3B)
as well as Notch reporter activity (Figure 3C). Consistent
with these effects, blood vessel endothelial cells (BECs)
from Cdk5fl/flTie2Cre embryos displayed reduced
expression of Notch target genes after Notch activation
by Dll4 (Figure 3D). Furthermore, the expression of the
Notch downstream target genes Hey1 and Hey2 was
decreased in tumors from endothelial Cdk5 knockout
mice (Figure 3E). All these findings point to a Cdk5-Notch
pathway for the regulation of angiogenesis. However,
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 did not
abrogate the Jagged1-induced Notch target expression
(Figure 4A, 4B), suggesting a specific regulation of
Dll4-driven Notch signaling by Cdk5.

Cdk5 regulates Notch dependent endothelial
functions
We next asked if Cdk5 could contribute to Notch
dependent endothelial functions like proliferation and
sprouting of endothelial cells [37, 38]. In fact, inhibition
of endothelial Cdk5 abrogated the Dll4-mediated decrease
of endothelial cell proliferation (Figure 6A). In line, Cdk5
inhibition increased sprouting of spheroids embedded
into Dll4-containing gels (Figure 6B). Moreover, in line
with the immunoblots in Figure 5 that showed reduced
NICD levels by Cdk5 inhibition, immunostainings suggest
reduced NICD levels in spheroids generated from Cdk5
siRNA treated cells (Figure 6C). Thus, inhibition of Cdk5
impaired endothelial cell functions which are dependent
on Dll4-driven Notch activation.

Cdk5 inhibition reduces tumor growth and
improves sensitivity to anti-angiogenic treatment
As described above, knockout of endothelial Cdk5
reduced tumor growth of wildtype B16F1 melanoma
cells (Figure 2A), demonstrating that endothelial Cdk5
regulates tumor growth. To investigate the influence of
Cdk5 inhibition on tumor growth in a more therapeutic
context, we used systemic treatment with the small
molecule Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine. Although, like
most kinase inhibitors, roscovitine is not selective for
the inhibition of Cdk5 but also addresses other Cdks
like Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk7, and Cdk9, it represents the bestestablished inhibitor for Cdk5 and therefore was used
as a model substance for our studies [39–41]. We used
a subcutaneous human U87 glioblastoma cell xenograft
model as glioblastoma represent highly vascularized
and aggressive tumors [42]. Roscovitine was given after
tumors had established and reduced glioblastoma growth
as shown by a significantly reduced growth rate of tumors
from roscovitine treated mice (Figure 7A). In endothelialspecific Cdk5 knockout mice, systemic treatment with
roscovitine slightly but not significantly reduced tumor
growth and decreased tumor cell proliferation as shown
by Ki67 staining (Figure 7B). Moreover, roscovitine had
no effect on vessel number in tumors grown in endothelial
Cdk5 knockout mice (Figure 7B). This set of data suggests
that Cdk5 indeed is the primary target of roscovitine,
but that roscovitine also acts on tumor cells as well and
inhibits other Cdks besides Cdk5. Pharmacokinetic studies
showed plasma concentrations of roscovitine comparable
to doses used in our cell-based assays (Figure 7C).
Together with the reduced growth of wildtype
tumors in endothelial Cdk5 knockout mice (Figure 2A),
this set of data provides evidence for Cdk5 as a drugable
target for anti-angiogenic therapy. Finally, we assessed the

Cdk5 regulates NICD generation
To understand the link between Cdk5 and the
Dll4-Notch pathway, further experiments focused on the
regulation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD),
the key mediator of Notch signaling [35]. After ligandinduced proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor,
NICD is released and translocates to the nucleus to drive
target gene transcription before the signal is terminated
by proteasomal degradation of NICD [35]. Inhibition of
Cdk5 by either knockdown or pharmacologic approaches
decreased Dll4-induced NICD generation (Figure 5A, 5B).
This was not based on changed Notch receptor expression
as Cdk5 silencing neither influenced Notch receptor
mRNA (Figure 5C) nor protein (Figure 5D). Furthermore,
the inhibition of the proteasomal degradation by MG132
did not abrogate the Cdk5 siRNA mediated decrease
of NICD (Figure 5E). To prove the functionality of
MG132, β-catenin was used as a positive control as it is
degraded by the proteasome [36]. Increased β-catenin in
the presence of MG132 proved that MG132 inhibited the
proteasomal degradation (Figure 5F). In line, exogenously
expressed NICD that is not dependent on Notch receptor
cleavage, was not affected by Cdk5 inhibition (Figure 5G).
Both results suggest that Cdk5 preferentially contributes
to NICD generation rather than its degradation. Cdk5
knockdown by siRNA as well as Cdk5 inhibition by
roscovitine decreased levels of phosphorylated and
total presenilin, the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase
multiprotein complex capable of mediating NICD
generation. (Figure 5H, 5I). This set of data suggests

the anti-VEGF antibody B20–4.1.1 did not reduce LLC

of growth factors is not effective in all cancers [46].
Therefore, it is essential to further understand how the
tumor vasculature can be effectively targeted in order
to develop new anti-angiogenic therapies. However, the
knowledge about intracellular processes that mediate
neovascularization is still limited.
Here, we show that endothelial Cdk5 contributes
to blood vessel development and tumor angiogenesis.
In doing so, this work provides the first evidence for an
in vivo role of Cdk5 in blood vessel formation. There have

Cdk5 was implicated in endothelial senescence [47], in

diseases associated with NO dysfunction [49, 50]. Our
former studies demonstrated that small molecule Cdk5
inhibitors exert anti-angiogenic effects and that Cdk5 is
implicated in endothelial cell migration by regulating the
small GTPase Rac1 which was restricted to in vitro assays.
However, the specific in vivo role of Cdk5 in the blood
vessel endothelium by genetic knockdown models has not
been addressed to date. Of note, as we started to analyze
the in vivo function of Cdk5 in the endothelium, we

observed no changes in arterial-venous cell specification
and blood vessel morphology by Cdk5 knockdown in the
endothelium [33]. In fact, we found that Cdk5 is essential
for lymphatic vessel development and valve formation by
phosphorylating the transcription factor Foxc2 [33]. Our
present study though elucidates a crucial role of Cdk5 in
blood vessel patterning.
With respect to the mechanisms and potential
targets of Cdk5 action in blood vessels, rather the Dll4/

Notch system was indicated to be important, as suggested
by the reminiscent phenotype of Cdk5 knockout mice to
angiogenesis observed by Dll4/Notch blockade. Similar
to the genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of endothelial
Cdk5, the disruption of Dll4/Notch signaling results
in increased vessel sprouting during development [3].
Dll4/Notch signaling regulates tip and stalk cell
specification during vascular morphogenesis. Dll4 is
induced in endothelial tip cells and activates Notch in
adjacent stalk cells which represses the tip cell phenotype.
Inhibition of the Notch pathway results in increased
vessel sprouting and branching due to excessive tip cell
formation and endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, in
line with our results showing dysfunction of tumor vessels
in endothelial Cdk5 knockout mice, preclinical models
have demonstrated that blockade of Dll4/Notch signaling
results in increased vessel sprouting and branching in
tumors and impairs tumor growth by promoting nonproductive angiogenesis [6, 7]. With respect to the
target of Cdk5 within the Dll4/Notch signaling hub our
work points to an alteration of presenilin/γ-secretase and
therefore the regulation of NICD generation by endothelial
Cdk5. In neurons presenilin/ γ-secretase was identified as
Cdk5 target before [51]. Presenilin comprises the catalytic
component of the γ-secretase multiprotein complex that
is essential for Notch receptor processing and NICD
generation [35].
Therapeutic targeting of the Dll4/Notch pathway
has evolved as an attractive anti-angiogenic strategy as the

adaptive ability of neoplastic cells to become anti-VEGF
resistant has arisen as a major obstacle to anti-angiogenic
therapies [2] and can be caused by compensation of
alternative angiogenesis mechanisms such as the Dll4/
Notch pathway [5, 8, 9]. Potentiated Notch signaling
due to either loss of a negative regulator or increased
expression of the Notch activating ligand Dll4 in the tumor
vasculature correlates with tumorigenesis and therapeutic
resistance [4, 5, 10, 52, 53]. In breast cancer, high Dll4
expression by intratumoral endothelial cells was elucidated
as an adverse prognostic factor of patient survival [54].
In line, strong expression of Dll4 in ovarian cancer was
associated with poor patient prognosis whereas low Dll4
expression correlated with responsiveness to anti-VEGF
therapy [8]. Recently, it was shown that the modulation
of Dll4/Notch by the extracellular matrix (ECM)
protein fibulin-3 promotes angiogenesis in high-grade
gliomas [42]. However, whereas Dll4 expression in tumors
consistently affected the vascular phenotype, tumor
growth was increased only in some tumors, probably
due to differences in the vasculature and/or levels of
endogenous components of the Dll4/Notch pathway
[4, 6]. In line, our study shows that Cdk5 inhibition alone
inhibited B16F1 melanoma growth but not LLC tumor
growth. Importantly, Dll4/Notch blockade has been shown
to inhibit the growth of anti-VEGF resistant tumors and
even enhance the sensitivity of tumors to anti-VEGF
treatment [5, 8, 9]. Consequently, various approaches have
been developed to target the Dll4/Notch pathway including

Tumor models

anti-Dll4 antibodies, Dll4-Fc and Notch-Fc decoys, DNA
vaccination, anti-Notch antibodies, as well as γ-secretase
inhibitors and anti-Dll4/Notch therapy is currently
evaluated in clinical trials for cancer therapy [9]. Still,
the molecular basis of this sensitizing effect has not been
well explained [9]. Here we show that Cdk5 inhibition
within the neovascular endothelium of burgeoning tumors
can sensitize them for more effective anti-angiogenic
treatment. This may be of particular relevance to tumors
such as lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) which have been
described to be resistant to anti-angiogenic treatment
[43]. Thus, the control of Notch signaling by Cdk5 in the
neovascularizing endothelium is proposed as an additional
target for tumor treatment although up to now, absolutely
selective inhibition specifically of Cdk5 is not possible
as the currently available Cdk5 inhibitors interfere with
other Cdks like Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk7, and Cdk9 as well.
Nevertheless, inhibition by small molecules inhibiting
Cdk5 and additionally Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk7, and Cdk9 have
shown promising effects in cancer/angiogenesis [18, 30,
31, 55, 56]. In fact, as inhibition of several kinases can
address different functions in endothelial as well as in
tumor cells, and therefore interfere with tumor growth and
progression in a multifaceted mode of action, this might be
beneficial in terms of therapeutic efficiency.
In sum, the present study elucidates an essential
in vivo role of Cdk5 in tumor angiogenesis suggesting
Cdk5 inhibition as a novel approach for anti-angiogenic
treatment.

B16F1 melanoma cells (1 × 106 cells in 100 µl PBS)
were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of 8 week old
Cdk5fl/flVECCre and control mice at day 15 after tamoxifen
injection when Cdk5 was downregulated. Tumor growth
was observed for 14 days (until d30). Tumor volume was
evaluated every 2nd day (π/6 × l × w × h). Tumor weight
was evaluated. In case of therapy with roscovitine, mice
were intraperitoneally treated with roscovitine (150 mg/kg,
3 × per week) starting from day 7 after tumor cell
injection, when tumors had established. The tumor volume
was evaluated three times per week. Mice were sacrificed
at day 14 and the tumor weight was determined.
U87 glioblastoma cells [4, 5] were subcutaneously
injected (5 × 106 cells in 100 µl PBS:Matrigel 1:1) into the
flanks of 6 week old female Balb/c nude mice (Harlan).
Mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with roscovitine
(150 mg/kg, 3 × per week) starting at day 7 after tumor
cell implantation when tumors had established and the
tumor volume was evaluated twice per week. Mice were
sacrificed at day 42. Tumor volume was modelled using
an exponential growth model where the tumor volume at
a given time t (N(t)) is a function of the starting volume
N (0), the time of growth t and of a growth rate α:
N (t) = N (0) • expα • t. Modeling was performed using
non-linear mixed effects modeling with the software
NONMEM 7.3. [58].
LLC cells (2 × 106 cells in 100 µl PBS) cells were
subcutaneously injected into the flanks of 8 week old
Cdk5fl/flVECCre and control mice at day 15 after tamoxifen
injection when Cdk5 was downregulated. Starting at d3
after tumor cell implantation, mice were treated with
anti-VEGF antibody (B20–4.1.1, Genentech, 5 mg/kg
2 × / week, i.p.) or solvent (PBS) respectively. Mice were
sacrificed at day 18 and tumor weight was evaluated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal experiments
All animal experiments were performed with
approval by the District Government of Upper Bavaria
in accordance with the German animal welfare and
institutional guidelines.

Pharmacokinetics
Plasma concentrations of roscovitine were
determined by HPLC-DAD. Mice were treated with
roscovitine and blood was collected after 10, 20, 30, 60,
120, and 240 min. For each time point, blood of three mice
was pooled.
100 µl mice blood were mixed with 200 µl
acetonitrile, vortexed (1 min), centrifuged (5 min, 10,000
g, RT) and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC-DAD
using an Agilent Series 1100 HPLC system (Waldbronn,
Germany) consisting of a quaternary pump system (G1311
A QuatPump), an autosampler (G1329 A ALS), a column
oven (G1316 A ColComp) and a UV-DAD detector
(G1315 A DAD). Chromatographic separation was carried
out with an Agilent poroshell 120 EC-C18 (100 × 3.0 mm,
i.d. 2.7 µm) column (Waldbronn, Germany) and a mobile
phase of acetonitrile and water (0.1% phosphoric acid,
1.0% tetrahydrofuran) 15:85 (v/v). The total run time was

Endothelial-specific Cdk5 knockout mice
Generation, breeding, and genotyping of endothelialspecific Cdk5 knockout mice was previously described
[33]. Floxed Cdk5 mice were described [57]. Tie2Cre mice
were from Jackson Laboratory (B6.Cg-Tg(Tek-cre)12Flv/J,
004128). Tamoxifen-inducible Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2
mice were described [34]. Endothelial Cdk5 knockdown
in pups was achieved by tamoxifen injection at day
1 – day 3 (50 µg / day i.p., Sigma Aldrich). Cdk5 knockdown
was proved at day 6 (Supplementary Figure 1A).
For deletion of Cdk5 in adult mice, tamoxifen (0.5 mg/day
i.p.) was injected at 5 consecutive days. Cdk5 knockdown
was proved two weeks and four weeks after treatment with
tamoxifen (Supplementary Figure 1B).

7 min with an isocratic flow rate at 1.0 ml/min, and an
injection volume of 10 µl. The column oven was set at
50°C. The UV detection wave-length was set at 292 nm.
Data analysis and instrument control was carried out
with Agilent ChemStation® software Rev. B04.02. The
average retention time of roscovitine was 3.1 min. The
concentration of roscovitine was determined according to
an external standard calibration.

BSA/PBS), incubated with anti-CD31 primary antibodies
(553370, BD Pharmingen) (o/n, 4°C), washed, incubated
with AlexaFluor-labeled secondary antibodies (2 h, RT),
and mounted. Numbers of branch points per field were
calculated by using Image J and the particle counter plugin.

Tumor vessel perfusion
At day 15 after tumor cell inoculation, mice were
intravenously injected (tail vein) with FITC-Lectin
(150 µg, 1 mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich). After circulation of
FITC-Lectin for 5 min, mice were sacrificed and tumors
were removed. Staining was performed according to the
description under immunohistochemistry. Vessels with
and without FITC-Lectin labeling were counted by using
ImageJ and the particle counter plugin.

Retina preparation and staining
Retina preparation and staining was performed
according to Pitulescu et al. [59]. Briefly, eyes were
removed, fixed in PFA 4% (2 h, RT) and retinae were
prepared. After blocking (2 h, RT), retinae were stained for
isolectin B4 (IB4, Alexa 488 conjugated, Millipore), and
BrdU staining was performed. Nuclei were labeled with
Hoechst33342. Pictures were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510
META confocal microscope. The area covered by ECs,
the numbers of branch points per field, number of BrdU
positive cells per field, and of sprouts per 1,000 µm vessel
length were calculated by using Image J.

Cells
HUVECs were cultivated as described [32] with
Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (ECGM, Promocell)
containing 10% FCS. Embryonic blood vessel endothelial
cells (BECs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
LSECs were isolated and cultivated as described [33].
For experiments with Dll4, plates were coated with Dll4
(5 µg/ml; 1 h RT or o/n 4°C; human Dll4 for HUVECs
and mouse Dll4 for mouse BECs, both R & D Systems
1506-D4 and 1389-D4). Plates were washed once with
PBS before cells were plated. For proteasome inhibition
experiments, MG132 (1 µM, Enzo Life Sciences)
stimulation was started 1 h before re-plating of HUVECs
onto Dll4. HUVECs were plated onto Dll4 for 1 h or 24 h.
BECs were plated onto Dll4 for 24 h.
For experiments with Jagged1, plates were coated
with Jagged1 (10 µg/ml; 1 h RT; R & D Systems 1277-JG).
Plates were washed once with PBS before cells were
plated. HUVECs were treated with roscovitine (10 µM)
or nt (non-targeting) or Cdk5 siRNA and plated onto Dll4
for 48 h.

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin sections: Tumors were removed, fixed with
PFA 4% for 24 h, left in PFA 1%, embedded into paraffin
and sections (5 µm) were prepared.
Cryosections: Tumors were removed and frozen into
TissueTek. 10 µm sections were prepared and fixed with
formalin 4% (10 min, RT).
Stainings: Sections were blocked (1% BSA/PBS),
incubated with primary antibodies (CD31, 553370, BD
Pharmingen; endomucin, sc-65495 Santa Cruz; α-SMA
C6198, Sigma) for 2 h, at RT or o/n at 4°C, washed,
incubated with AlexaFluor-labeled secondary antibodies
(45 min, RT, Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33342
(5 µg/ml) and mounted (Fluorsave Reagent, Calbiochem).
Pictures were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal
microscope.
For evaluations of stainings, ImageJ and the particle
counter plugin were used. Vessel number was determined
by counting the number of vessels per mm2. Vessel
size was determined by evaluating the area covered by
vessels divided by the number of vessels per µm2. For the
quantification of smooth muscle cell coverage of vessels,
tumor sections were stained for CD31 and α-smooth
muscle cell actin (α-SMA). Vessels with and without
αSMA-staining were counted.

Transfection of cells
HUVECs were transfected using Targefect
(Targeting Systems; El Cajon, California) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA, Transfection Media,
Targefect and Virofect Enhancer were mixed and incubated
for 25 min. The transfection complex was added to the
cells for 2 h. Fresh HUVEC medium was added to the
cells for 24 h. NICD plasmid was from addgene (26892).
The siRNAs were from Thermo Scientific/Dharmacon:
nt siRNA D-001810–01; Cdk5 siRNA J-003239–09 and
J-003239–10. For the experiments involving Cdk5 siRNA,
a mix of both siRNAs was used.

Whole mount staining of embryonic skin and
yolk sacs
Tissues were removed, fixed (formalin 4%,
30 min, RT), washed, blocked (1 h, RT, 0.5% TritonX, 2%

Spheroids

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

HUVECs were transfected with nt or Cdk5 siRNA.
Spheroids were generated via the hanging drop method
as described [37]. Briefly, a suspension of HUVECs and
20% Methocel was mixed and 20 µl drops were seeded
onto a petri dish and incubated upside down over night.
Spheroids were embedded into HUVEC growth medium
containing 5% Minimal Essential Eagle’s Medium
(Sigma), 5% Bicarbonate, 60% collagen and Dll4
(5 µg/ml). The collagen pellets were covered with ECGM
containing 20% FCS. Pictures were taken on day 0,
1, 2 and 3. Sprout length and number of sprouts were
determined.
For spheroid staining, embedded spheroids were
fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0, 2% Triton X
and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 3 days. Primary
antibody (NICD 4147, Cell Signalling) was incubated
for 3 days and secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 488, Life
Technologies) for further 3 days. Nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33342 (0, 5 µg/ml, 40 min, RT). Pictures were
taken at the Leica SP8 SMD confocal microscope.
