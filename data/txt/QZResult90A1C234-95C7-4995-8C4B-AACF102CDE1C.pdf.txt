ABSTRACT
Ciclopirox olamine (CPX), a fungicide, has been demonstrated as a potential
anticancer agent. However, the underlying anticancer mechanism is not well
understood. Here, we found that CPX induced autophagy in human rhabdomyosarcoma
(Rh30 and RD) cells. It appeared that CPX-induced autophagy was attributed to
induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS
scavenger and antioxidant, prevented this process. Furthermore, we observed that
CPX induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
and p38 MAPK, which was also blocked by NAC. However, only inhibition of JNK
(with SP600125) or expression of dominant negative c-Jun partially prevented
CPX-induced autophagy, indicating that ROS-mediated activation of JNK signaling
pathway contributed to CPX-induced autophagy. Of interest, inhibition of autophagy
by chloroquine (CQ) enhanced CPX-induced cell death, indicating that CPX-induced
autophagy plays a pro-survival role in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Our finding
suggests that the combination with autophagy inhibitors may be a novel strategy in
potentiating the anticancer activity of CPX for treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma.

be determined [2]. Recent studies have shown that CPX
induces cell death in different cancer cells, such as primary
human acute myeloid leukemia cells, human breast cancer
MDA-MB231 cells and human rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30
cells [3, 4]. However, the mechanism by which CPX induces
cancer cell death is only at the beginning to be investigated.
Eberhard et al. reported that CPX displays preclinical
anticancer activity against hematologic malignancies and
induces cell death through its ability to chelate intracellular
iron and inhibit the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide
reductase [4]. We showed that CPX inhibits tumor growth
in human breast cancer MDA-MB231 xenografts and
induces cell death through caspase-dependent and caspaseindependent mechanisms in Rh30 cells [3].

INTRODUCTION
Ciclopirox olamine (CPX) (also called Batrafen,
Loprox, Penlac and Stieprox), a synthetic hydroxypyridone
derivative, is currently used for the treatment of superficial
fungal infections and available in a variety of formulations,
including cream, lotion, gel, nail lacquer and shampoos [1].
CPX has a broad spectrum of action against dermatophytes,
yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria. Mechanistically,
CPX has been proposed to act as an iron chelator, forming
complexes with trivalent metal cations, such as Fe3+, and
inhibiting metal-dependent enzymes, such as catalase and
peroxidase, which play an essential role in the intracellular
degradation of toxic peroxides, though this remains to

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic
process that involves the degradation of the components
of a cell through the lysosomal machinery [5]. During
autophagy, a portion of the cytoplasmic materials and
intracellular organelles are sequestered into a double
membrane organelles known as autophagosomes, which
degrade the sequestered contents by fusion with lysosomes
to form autolysosomes [5]. Under some conditions,
autophagy contributes to cellular survival by providing
nutrients and energy to help cells adapt to starvation
or stress (such as hypoxia, X-ray and anticancer drugs)
[6]. However, under other settings, activated autophagy
leads to cell death, called autophagic cell death or type II
programmed cell death [6].
Increasing evidence has implicated that multiple
stress conditions such as oxidative stress [7], endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress [8] and pathogen infection [9],
can induce autophagy through different molecular
pathways. Among them, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
function as signaling molecules not only in cell growth,
differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis [10], but also
in autophagy [11]. For example, hydrogen peroxide and
2-methoxyestradiol, two ROS-generating agents, can
induce autophagic cell death in transformed HEK293 cells
and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells [12]. Under starvation or
oxidative stress conditions, ROS are increased and play a
critical role in autophagosome formation through targeting
cysteine protease Atg 4 [13]. Although the role of ROS
in the regulation of autophagy has been confirmed, what
signaling molecules involved in ROS-induced autophagy
are still not well understood.
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are
evolutionarily conserved dual (Tyr and Ser/Thr) protein
kinases, and play an important role in signal transduction
from the cell surface to the nucleus [14]. To date, different
groups of MAPKs have been characterized in mammals:
the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2,
ERK3/4, ERK5, ERK7/8, the Jun N-terminal kinases
JNK1/2/3 and the p38 MAPKs p38α/β/γ/δ [14]. Not only
receptor-ligand interactions, but also different stress stimuli
such as the oxidative stress caused by ROS, can induce
potential activation of MAPK pathways [15]. Depending
on the cell type and the stimulus, ERK signaling pathway
mediates different cell responses, such as proliferation,
apoptosis and autophagy [14–16]. Generally, growth
factors may activate the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2
pathway [14]. More recently, ERK5, also termed big
mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (BMK1), has been
identified as a component of a parallel MAPK pathway,
which is associated with a diverse range of cellular
processes including cellular proliferation, migration,
survival and angiogenesis [17]. The demonstration that
the commonly used MEK1/2 inhibitors inactivated ERK5
suggested that ERK5 might regulate some of the cellular
functions originally attributed to MEK1/2 [17, 18]. Studies
have demonstrated that mammalian p38 MAPK has four
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

isoforms: p38α, p38β, p38γ and p38δ, of which p38α is
ubiquitously expressed, and best characterized [14,19].
p38 MAPK plays an essential role in the regulation of
many cellular events including inflammation, cell growth,
death, and differentiation [14, 19, 20]. Recently it has
been found that p38 MAPK can also mediate autophagy
in response to chemotherapeutic agents [21]. JNK, also
known as the stress-activated protein kinase, has been
implicated in apoptosis and autophagy [21–23]. In
mammals, there are three JNK genes: JNK1, JNK2, and
JNK3 [24]. JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed,
while JNK3 is mainly expressed in brain, cardiac smooth
muscle and testes [24]. In addition to apoptosis, JNK also
contributes to autophagic induction in response to stress
signals [21]. Particularly, ROS can induce JNK-dependent
autophagy [25, 26].
Here we found that CPX induced autophagy in
rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30 and RD) cells, which was
mediated by ROS induction, leading to activation of JNK
cascade. Further, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine
(CQ) increased the cell death induced by CPX, indicating
that CPX-induced autophagy played a pro-survival role in
human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Our findings suggest that
combination treatment with CPX and pharmacological
autophagy inhibitors might be a promising strategy for
rhabdomyosarcoma therapy.

RESULTS
CPX reduces cell viability and alters morphology
in rhabdomyosarcoma cells
To investigate the cytotoxicity of CPX in
rhabdomyosarcoma cells, RD and Rh30 cells were
treated with various concentrations of CPX for 72 h,
followed by MTS assay. As shown in Figure 1A, CPX
decreased the cell viability in both RD and Rh30 cells
in a concentration-dependent manner. By phase-contrast
microscopic observation, more cells became round or
detached from the culture plate when exposed to 20 μM
of CPX (Figure 1B). To determine whether CPX causes
cell death by inducing apoptosis, cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry following Annexin V-FITC and
propidium iodide (PI) staining. As shown in Figure 1C,
20 µM of CPX treatment for 48 and 72 h significantly
increased the percentage of apoptotic cells compared
with control cells.

CPX induces autophagy in
rhabdomyosarcoma cells
Recently we have demonstrated that CPX induces
caspase-dependent and independent cell death in Rh30
cells [3]. Since autophagy contributes to cell death in
some cases [6], here we studied whether CPX induces
autophagy in the cancer cells. Autophagy is characterized

by the increased acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs),
which are correlated with increased autophagosomes.
We therefore investigated whether CPX could induce
autophagy by staining with acridine orange (AO) in RD
cells. As shown in Figure 2A, 20 µM of CPX treatment
for 24 h or 48 h induced the accumulation of AVO in the
cytoplasm of RD cells.
LC3 is associated with the formation of the
autophagosome membrane and is a specific marker
for autophagy initiation [5]. Under normal conditions,
LC3 is distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm;
when autophagy is induced, LC3 is recruited to the
autophagosomal membrane and shows characteristic
of GFP-LC3 puncta [5]. To elucidate whether CPX
induced autophagy in rhabdomyosarcoma cells, the
effect of CPX on the cellular localization of LC3 using
Rh30 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 was evaluated.
As shown in Figure  2B, CPX treatment induced
a punctuated fluorescent pattern of LC3, whereas

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

untreated cells manifested a diffuse distribution of
GFP-LC3, suggesting that CPX indeed induced
autophagy in the cells.
Since LC3-I is converted to the hallmark
autophagosome-associating protein LC3-II, expression
of LC3-II has been widely used for monitoring
autophagy [27]. To verify the above finding, we further
tested whether CPX increases LC3-II protein level. The
Western blotting results indicated that CPX potently
increased LC3-II level in a time- and concentrationdependent manner in RD cells (Figure 2C). Moreover,
induction of autophagy by CPX was identified by
assessing the expressions of Beclin-1, a key regulator of
autophagosome formation and p62/SQSTM1, a protein
facilitating autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated
protein aggregation [28]. CPX treatment decreased the
expression of p62, but did not affect Beclin-1 expression
(Figure 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that
CPX induces autophagy in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.

CPX induces autophagy via ROS induction

including JNK, p38 and ERK1/2 [14]. Also, studies have
shown that MAPKs play a pivotal role in autophagy [16,
21, 29]. In this study, we observed that CPX induced
phosphorylation of p38α (Thr180/Tyr182), ERK1/2 and
JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185) in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 4A). Thus, we next asked whether CPXinduced autophagy involves these MAPKs. To this
end, selective inhibitors of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK were
employed. As shown in Figure 4B, pretreatment with
U0126, a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 (upstream
kinases of ERK1/2), or doramapimod (also named
BIRB  796), a highly selective p38α MAPK inhibitor
[30], markedly suppressed CPX-induced phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 or p38, respectively. However, neither of
the inhibitors apparently affected CPX-induced LC3-II
expression, suggesting that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK are
not involved in CPX-induced autophagy. By contrast,
presence of JNK inhibitor, SP600125, potently inhibited the
activation of JNK pathway and LC3-II expression induced
by CPX (Figure 4D). To further confirm the role of JNK
signaling pathway in CPX-induced autophagy, RD  cells
were infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding
FLAG-tagged dominant negative c-Jun (Ad-c-Jun-DN) or
Ad-GFP (as control), and then treated with CPX for 24 h.
As shown in Figure 4E, ectopic expression of dominant

Growing evidence shows that ROS are important
regulators of autophagy under various conditions [11].
To determine whether CPX-induced autophagy is
associated with ROS induction, we first measured ROS
level in both RD and Rh30 cells treated with CPX using
the ROS-detecting fluorescent dye CM-H2DCFDA.
ROS accumulation was observed after CPX treatment
with the culturing time, and increased ~2-fold after 24 h
of CPX (20  μM) treatment in Rh30 cells (Figure  3A).
Similar  results were seen in RD cells (Figure 3B).
Addition of 5 mM of NAC, a ROS scavenger, almost
completely blocked CPX-induced ROS in both Rh30 and
RD cells (Figure 3C and 3D). Interestingly, pretreatment
with NAC remarkably attenuated CPX-induced GFP-LC3
puncta formation (Figure 3E) and LC3-II expression in the
cells (Figure 3F), indicating that CPX-induced autophagy
is mediated by ROS induction.

a fungicide, is a very promising anticancer agent and may
be repurposed for cancer therapy.
Though CPX has been used as a fungicide for
over 20 years, its antifungal mechanism is still not well
understood. However, it has been proposed that CPX
acts as an iron chelator, forming complexes with trivalent
metal cations, such as Fe3+, and inhibiting iron-dependent
enzymes, such as catalase and peroxidase, which catalyze
degradation of toxic peroxides, resulting in oxidative
toxicity in fungi [35]. Recently, it has been found that
CPX induces cell death by chelating intracellular iron
and inhibiting the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide
reductase in human leukemia and myeloma cells [4].
CPX induces apoptosis by increasing caspase-3/7 activity
and down-regulating of protein expressions of Bcl-xL
and survivin in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells [3].
Furthermore, CPX inhibits Wnt/β-catenin pathway [36],
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity [37],
and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A)
function [32, 38]. It is unknown whether iron chelation is
implicated in these effects of CPX. Clearly, the antitumor
mechanism of CPX is complex and needs to be further
investigated.
In the present study, for the first time, we found that
CPX induced autophagy in human rhabdomyosarcoma
RD and Rh30 cells. Although the precise mechanism of

DISCUSSION
CPX is an off-patent drug and currently used for the
treatment of skin and nail fungal infection [1]. Recently,
CPX has also been found to possess anticancer properties,
by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing cell death, as
well as inhibiting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
[3, 4, 32, 33]. Oral administration of CPX at a dose of
20–25 mg/kg/day for 24–28 days inhibits the growth of
xenografted leukemia (MDAY-D2, K562 and OCI-AML2)
and primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells,
as well as breast cancer (MDA-MB231) cells by 65–75%
compared with vehicle control, but does not display
evidence of weight loss or gross organ toxicity in mice
[3, 4]. Furthermore, a recent phase I clinical trial has
demonstrated that oral administration of CPX at a dose
of 40 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days is well tolerated in all
patients without dose-limiting toxicity, displays persistent
pharmacodynamic activity in the patients, and induces
disease stabilization and/or hematologic improvement
in 2/3 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies
[34]. Taken together, these findings highlight that CPX, as

autophagy remains unclear, growing evidence has implicated
that ROS play a critical role in controlling autophagy. ROS
are highly reactive molecules formed by the incomplete
one-electron reduction of oxygen, including oxygen ions
and peroxides [39]. ROS form as a natural byproduct
of the normal metabolism of oxygen and participate in
cell signaling and homeostasis at low levels. However,
under environmental stress, high levels of ROS can cause
irreversible oxidative damage to cell structures [39].
Several stimuli that induce ROS generation can also induce
autophagy, such as nutrient starvation, hypoxia, oxidative
stress and some chemotherapeutic agents [7]. Alterations
in ROS levels and autophagy play a crucial role in cancer
initiation and progression, and both are recognized as the
potential targets for cancer treatment [31, 40]. Our present
data showed that CPX induced ROS, which were detectable
in 4 h and increased by approximately 2-fold in 24 h of
treatment. NAC, the ROS scavenger, remarkably attenuated
CPX-induced GFP-LC3 puncta formation and LC3-II
expression. Our results suggest that CPX triggers autophagy
by induction of ROS.
Multiple signaling molecules, such as MAPKs,
mTOR, and class III PI3K, have been shown to regulate
autophagy [24, 41]. The MAPKs, including ERK1/2,
JNK and p38 MAPK, are a family of serine/threonine
kinases that regulate a variety of cellular events such
as proliferation and apoptosis [42]. It is well known
that activation of JNK contributes to stress-induced
apoptosis [42]. Recent studies have further revealed
that activation of JNK is also associated with autophagy
induction [24]. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces
autophagosome formation and accumulation by activation
of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-JNK pathway [43].
Bufalin induces autophagy via ROS induction and JNK
activation [44]. Here we found that CPX was able to
activate p38α, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2, but only activation
of JNK pathway was responsible for CPX-induced
autophagy. This is strongly supported by the findings that
inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or ectopic expression of
dominant negative c-Jun potently inhibited CPX-induced
autophagy, whereas inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38α using
U0126 and doramapimod, respectively, failed to prevent
CPX-induced autophagy. These results suggest that JNK
pathway plays a critical role in CPX-induced autophagy.
Our further study showed that pre-treatment with NAC
prevented CPX-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and
autophagy, indicating that CPX-induced autophagy
is dependent on ROS-activated JNK cascade. Further
research is needed to address whether CPX induces
autophagy also by targeting mTOR and class III PI3K.
Recent studies have shown that several anticancer
agents including tamoxifen, 5-fluorouraci and rapamycin
can induce autophagy [45–47]. However, the role of
autophagy in cancer therapy is complex and controversial.
It has been reported that increased autophagy may be
pro-apoptotic [48] or pro-survival [45], depending
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

on experimental conditions (cell types and anticancer
agents). Some efforts have been made to find under what
conditions autophagy can be exploited for cancer therapy.
Of note, inhibition of autophagy enhances vorinostat or
tamoxifen-induced apoptosis [46, 49]. Here we observed
that disruption of autophagy using CQ increased CPXinduced apoptosis, indicating that CPX-induced autophagy
is a pro-survival mechanism in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.
In conclusion, we show that CPX induced
autophagy in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. CPXinduced autophagy was mediated by ROS induction
and JNK activation. Disruption of autophagy using CQ
enhanced CPX-induced cell death, indicating that CPXinduced autophagy is a pro-survival mechanism in the
cells. Our findings suggest that combination of CPX and
an autophagy inhibitor (e.g. CQ) may be a promising
strategy for cancer therapy.

Cell viability assay

GFP-LC3 puncta assay

Cell viability was determined by MTS (3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) assay,
according to the protocol of CellTiter 96® AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega). Briefly,
100 μl of cell suspensions were seeded into each well of
96-well plates (1×104 cells/well) and incubate overnight.
The cells were then exposed to the tested compounds
in triplicates for 72 h, followed by adding 20 μl of One
Solution Reagent per well. After further incubation
at 37°C for 1–2 h, cell viability was determined by
measuring the optical density (OD) at 490 nm using
a Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences, Wellesley, MA).

Rh30 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were seeded
at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. The
next day, the cells were treated without or with 20 μM
of CPX for different time (8 and 24 h), or with different
concentrations of CPX (0–20 μM) for 24 h, and examined
under a fluorescence microscope.

Western blot analysis
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of
5 × 105 cells/well. The next day, the cells were treated
with CPX (0–20 μM) for 24 h, or with 20 μM CPX for
0–24 h. For experiments with NAC or MAPK inhibitors,
cells were pre-incubated with or without NAC or MAPK
inhibitors for 1 h, respectively. The cells were then treated
with or without CPX (10 and 20 μM) for 24 h. Cell
lysis and immunoblotting were performed as described
previously [3]. β-tubulin served as a loading control.

Cell morphological analysis
Rh30 and RD cells were seeded in 6-well plates
(2 × 105 cells/well). The next day, the cells were treated
with CPX (0, 5 and 20 μM). After incubation for 72 h,
images were taken with an Olympus inverted phasecontrast microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Melville, NY)
(200×) equipped with the Quick Imaging system.

Infection of cells with recombinant adenovirus
Recombinant adenoviruses expressing FLAGtagged dominant negative c-Jun (FLAG-Δ169) (Ad-c-JunDN) and green fluorescence protein (GFP) (Ad-GFP) were
described [50]. For experiments, RD cells were seeded in
6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. The next
day, the cells were infected with the Ad-c-Jun-DN or
Ad-GFP (as a control) for 24 h at 5 of multiplicity of
infection (MOI = 5). The cells were then treated with
CPX (0–20 μM) for 24 h, followed by cell viability,
morphology, and Western blot analysis. Expression of
FLAG-tagged dominant negative c-Jun was confirmed by
Western blotting with antibody to FLAG.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were pre-incubated with or without 5 μM
of CQ for 1 h, and then treated with or without CPX
(1, 5 and 20 μM) for 48 h. Cells were then collected
and stained using Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection
Kit I (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. In brief, cells were washed with cold PBS, and
then resuspended in 100 μl of Annexin-V binding buffer,
followed by incubation with FITC conjugated Annexin V
and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room temperature
in the dark. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS
Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).
Cells treated with vehicle alone (100% ethanol) were used
as a control.

Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean values ± standard
deviation (mean ± SD). The data were analyzed by oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by posthoc Dunnett’s t-test for multiple comparisons. A level of
P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

ROS detection

Conflict of interest statement

Intracellular level of ROS was measured by
detecting the fluorescent intensity of oxidant-sensitive
probe CM-H2DCFDA, which is taken up by cells,
cleaved by esterases to DCFH and trapped intracellularly.
Briefly, Rh30 and RD cells were seeded at a density of
1  ×  104 cells/well in 96-well plates. The next day, the
cells were pre-incubated with or without NAC (5 mM)
for 30  min, and then treated with or without CPX
(0–20 μM) for 30 min, followed by loading with 10 μM of
CM-H2DCFDA. At different time points (2, 4, 8 and 24 h),
the fluorescent intensity was detected by excitation at 485
nm and emission at 535 nm using a Wallac 1420 Multilabel
Counter (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Wellesley, MA).
