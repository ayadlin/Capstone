ABSTRACT
The multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is produced by
several types of cancers, including prostate cancer, and promote tumour progression
in autocrine and paracrine manners. In response to ligand binding, the TGFβ type I
receptor (TβRI) activates Smad and non-Smad signalling pathways. The ubiquitinligase tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was recently
linked to regulate intramembrane proteolytic cleavage of the TβRI in cancer cells.
Subsequently, the intracellular domain (ICD) of TβRI enters in an unknown manner
into the nucleus, where it promotes the transcription of pro-invasive genes, such
as MMP2 and MMP9. Here we show that the endocytic adaptor molecules APPL1
and APPL2 are required for TGFβ-induced nuclear translocation of TβRI-ICD and for
cancer cell invasiveness of human prostate and breast cancer cell lines. Moreover,
APPL proteins were found to be expressed at high levels in aggressive prostate cancer
tissues, and to be associated with TβRI in a TRAF6-dependent manner. Our results
suggest that the APPL–TβRI complex promotes prostate tumour progression, and
may serve as a prognostic marker.

the glycine-serine (GS)-rich domain of TβRI, leading
to conformational changes and activation of the kinase
activity of TβRI. Activated TβRI induces phosphorylation
of the C-terminal SSXS motif of receptor-activated
SMADs (SMAD2 and 3), which then translocate to the
nucleus where they regulate the expression of target genes
together with the common mediator SMAD4 [3–7]. TGFβ
also signals via non-SMAD pathways, including Erk,
JNK and p38 MAP-kinase pathways, phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) and the tyrosine kinase Src [8, 9]. For
activation of the TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and the
downstream p38/JNK pathways that promote apoptosis
and EMT, the tumour necrosis factor-associated factor
6 (TRAF6) is essential [10, 11]. TRAF6 also promotes
the proteolytic cleavage of TβRI and the release of the

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the second most common cause
of cancer-related death among men in the Western
world  [1]. High levels of transforming growth factor β
(TGFβ) is known to be associated with a poor prognosis
for the patients [2]. Members of the TGFβ family regulate
cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration
and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and
are therefore important for embryogenesis and tissue
homeostasis in adults, as well as for cancer progression.
TGFβ signals by binding to type I and type II serine/
threonine kinase receptors (TβRI and TβRII, respectively).

intracellular domain (ICD) that translocates to the nucleus
in an unknown manner, and drives an invasiveness
programme [12, 13].
TGFβ receptor signalling is regulated by both
clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is used by many
cell-surface receptors such as the epidermal growth factor
(EGF) receptor and G protein-coupled receptors, as well
as by lipid raft/caveolin-mediated endocytosis  [14]. In
clathrin-dependent endocytosis, TGFβ receptors are
internalized to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P)enriched, early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1)-positive
endosomes, where they interact with the SMAD anchor
for receptor activation (SARA) to induce the canonical
SMAD-dependent signalling pathway  [15]. From the
early endosome, TGFβ receptors can be recycled back
to the cell surface in the absence of ligand by entering
Rab11-positive endosomes [16, 17]. In lipid raft/caveolaedependent endocytosis, the association of TGFβ receptors
with SMAD7 and the ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 facilitates
the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the receptors by
their internalization into caveolin-1-positive vesicles [15].
The small GTPase Rab5 is a key regulator of the
early steps of endosomal sorting and is implicated in
transducing TGFβ signals  [18]. Rab5 interacts with
and regulates the activities of EEA1 and PI3K [19, 20].
APPL1 and APPL2 are Rab5 effector proteins and
are multifunctional adaptor proteins that contain an
N-terminal bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs 167 (BAR) domain,
a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal
phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain  [21]. APPL
endosomes can act as precursors of classical EEA1positive endosomes, and depletion of PI-3-phosphate leads
to an expansion of the APPL compartments [22]. APPL1
is implicated in several signalling pathways, such as the
EGF [23], androgen [24], and NF-κB [25] pathways, but
has not previously been linked to TGFβ signalling. Upon
EGF stimulation, APPL1 is released from early endosomes
and translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with
the nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation
machinery [23, 26, 27]. In addition, APPL1 interacts with
signalling proteins, including Akt [21] and PI3K [21, 24].
Through its varied interactions, APPL1 has been reported
to mediate apoptosis [28], cell proliferation [23, 26], as
well as the endosomal localization of proteins [29, 30].
APPL1 and Rab5a have recently been found to be
overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma  [31], but the
precise role of APPL proteins in malignancies is still
unknown.
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms mediating
invasion of prostate cancer cells, we investigated the role
of APPL proteins in TGFβ-induced signal transduction.
In this report, we identify APPL1 as a TβRI- and PKCζassociated protein and show that APPL1 and APPL2 are
required for the nuclear translocation of TβRI-ICD, and
thereby promote progression of prostate cancer cells.

RESULTS
Nuclear accumulation of the ICD of TβRI is
dependent on APPL proteins
We have previously reported that TβRI undergoes
proteolytic cleavage in cancer cells, whereby TβRIICD is released from the membrane and is translocated
into the nucleus, however, the molecular mechanism
involved is not known  [12,  13]. As APPL proteins act
as adaptor proteins that facilitate cargo trafficking from
the endosomal membranes to the nucleus in response
to EGF [24, 32], we explored the possibility that APPL
proteins are involved in the TGFβ-induced nuclear
translocation of TβRI-ICD.
We investigated the subcellular localization of
endogenous APPL1 and TβRI-ICD in human prostate
cancer PC-3U cells using immunofluorescence staining
and confocal imaging. Interestingly, stimulation by TGFβ
for 30 minutes induced the co-localization of APPL1 and
TβRI-ICD in the nucleus, as visualized by staining with
antibodies recognizing APPL1 and the C-terminal part
of TβRI, respectively  [12,  23]. By contrast, almost no
TβRI-ICD translocated into the nuclei of TGFβ-treated
cells after knockdown of endogenous APPL1 and APPL2
(Figure 1A). Next, we analyzed the localization of a fusion
protein in which GFP was linked to the C-terminus of
TβRI-ICD. GFP-TβRI-ICD co-localized with endogenous
APPL1 in PC-3U nuclei after TGFβ treatment for
30  minutes, whereas there was no significant nuclear
accumulation of GFP-TβRI-ICD when APPL1 and APPL2
expression was silenced (Figure 1B). To further explore
the possibility that TGFβ induces a complex between
APPL1 and TβRI-ICD, we performed a proximity ligation
assay (PLA)  [33]. We found that TGFβ stimulation
induced a complex of APPL1 and TβRI in cells, as shown
by the red dots in Figure 1C; as expected, no such signals
were seen when APPL1/2 was knocked down by siRNA
(Figure 1C).
To further confirm that APPL proteins participate
in the nuclear translocation of TβRI-ICD, we performed
nuclear fractionation of cell lysates from TGFβ-treated
PC-3U cells. We observed that nuclear accumulation
of endogenous TβRI-ICD decreased after siRNAmediated silencing of APPL1 and APPL2 (Figure  1D).
In addition, knockdown of APPL1 and APPL2 led to
less accumulation of a HA-tagged TβRI-ICD  [13] in
the nucleus (Figure S1A). That APPL1 promotes TGFβinduced translocation of TβRI-ICD is further supported
by the observation that transient overexpression of GFPAPPL1 enhanced the nuclear translocation of TβRIICD (Figure  S1B). The amount of nuclear p-SMAD2
decreased slightly at 2–6  hours after TGFβ stimulation
of APPL1- and APPL2-depleted cells (Figure  1D, 1E).
Moreover, the level of p-p38 was increased in APPL1 and

suggest that APPL proteins are implicated in TGFβstimulated p38 MAPK and SMAD2 activation, as well as

effect on the interaction of APPL1 and TβRI (Figure S1C).
Moreover, His-tagged TβRI-ICD and HA-TβRI bound
to recombinant GST-tagged APPL1 (Figure  2C, 2D),
confirming the results shown in Figure  2A, 2B, that
endogenous proteins interacted.
To elucidate which part of APPL1 mediates binding
to TβRI, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and
immunofluorescence experiments with various APPL
fragments. Transient expression of HA-TβRI together
with two different GFP-APPL truncation mutants in
PC-3U cells revealed that the C-terminus, but not the
N-terminus, of APPL1 bound to TβRI (Figure S1D, S1E).
We conclude that TGFβ promotes the association of TβRI
and APPL1, consistent with the possibility that at least a
portion of TβRI is found in APPL1-positive endosomes.

APPL forms a complex with TβRI
APPL endosomes have been found to be crucial for
cargo trafficking and signal transduction downstream of
various receptors including adiponectin receptors  [32].
APPL endosomes are thought to be the precursors of
classical EEA1-positive endosomes, and PI3P is important
for their maturation  [22]. We therefore investigated
whether APPL1 forms a physical complex with TβRI. We
performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using
lysates of PC-3U cells that were treated, or not, with TGFβ.
We observed that TGFβ treatment promoted an interaction
between endogenous APPL1 and the full length TβRI
(Figure 2A, 2B). Notably, this interaction was enhanced
when the cells were pretreated with the PI3K inhibitors
LY294002 or wortmannin, which prevent the maturation
of APPL-positive endosomes into EEA1-positive
endosomes (Figure  2A, 2B). By contrast, treatment of
cells with the TβRI kinase inhibitor SB 505124 had no

TRAF6 is required for TβRI–APPL complex

The subcellular localization of proteins can be
modulated by post-translational modifications, such as
phosphorylation and Lys63-linked polyubiquitination [34].
We have previously shown that the E3 ubiquitin ligase
TRAF6 is required for the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination
of TβRI and the subsequent formation of the TβRI- ICD

APPL proteins are involved in the trafficking of
TβRI-ICD to the nucleus

in response to stimulation with TGFβ, in a manner
dependent on PKCζ [10]. We therefore investigated the
role of TRAF6 in TGFβ-induced endosomal sorting of
TβRI to APPL1-positive endosomes. PLA analysis using
antisera against Lys63-linked polyubiquitin and APPL1
suggested that APPL1 is subjected to Lys63-linked
polyubiquitination (Figure  3A). Moreover, TβRI was
sorted to APPL1-positive endosomes in control cells, but
not in cells depleted of TRAF6 by siRNA (Figure 3B).
As we have previously shown that TRAF6 and PKCζ are
important for proteolytic cleavage of TβRI, we investigated
whether APPL1 interacts with PKCζ. A TGFβ-induced
association of APPL1 with PKCζ was demonstrated by
PLA analysis (Figure 3C); this interaction was not seen
after knockdown of TRAF6 by siRNA, as analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation (Figure 3D). PKCζ pseudosubstrate
or TβRI kinase inhibitors had no effect on the association
between APPL1 and PKCζ (Figure  S2A,  S2B). These
observations suggest that TRAF6 promotes the sorting of
TβRI to APPL1-positive endosomes.

To further verify the role of APPL proteins in
trafficking of TβRI, we transiently co-transfected GFPtagged APPL1 and C-terminally HA-tagged TβRI in
PC-3U cells, and examined the subcellular localization
of these proteins using confocal imaging. We observed
that GFP-APPL1 and HA-TβRI co-localized in the
nucleus in response to TGFβ, whereas the nuclear
translocation of the proteins was prevented in cells
treated with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Figure 4A).
Co- immunoprecipitation revealed that endogenous APPL1
associated with TβRI-ICD in nuclear fractions derived
from PC-3U cells in a TGFβ-dependent manner; however,
treatment with wortmannin inhibited the formation of
a nuclear complex of APPL1 and TβRI (Figure  4B).
In addition to the co-localization with APPL-positive
endosomes in the cytosol (Figure  4A), TβRI was also
localized in Rab5-positive endosomes (Figure 4C). TGFβ

APPL proteins promote nuclear TβRI-ICDinduced cancer invasion

treatment induced the localization of TβRI in Rab5-positive
endosomes; however, most TβRI remained close to the
plasma membrane when the PC-3U cells were pretreated
with wortmannin (Figure  4C). Furthermore, TβRI was
detected in EEA1-positive endosomes after TGFβ
treatment for 30 minutes, whereas significantly less TβRI
was present in EEA1-positive endosomes after knockdown
of APPL1 and APPL2 (Figure 4D). The amount of nuclear
TβRI-ICD that could be detected by immunoblotting
decreased after pretreatment of cells with wortmannin
(Figure 4E), in line with data shown in Figure 4B. Many
proteins are transported along microtubules, therefore,
we investigated whether APPL1 associates with β-tubulin
using co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Figure 4F, we
found that APPL1 associates with microtubules and that
this interaction is promoted by TRAF6. Taken together,
these observations suggest that APPL proteins are involved
in trafficking of the TβRI-ICD from the endosomes to
the nucleus via microtubules in a TRAF6-dependent
manner, and that APPL1 maturation, shedding and nuclear
accumulation are controlled by different phosphoinositides,
consistent with previous observations [22], [27].

Nuclear TβRI-ICD has been found to promote
the invasion of various cancer cells  [12,  13] and as
APPL proteins was found to be crucial for its nuclear
translocation, we investigated the role of APPL1 and
APPL2 in TGFβ-induced invasiveness in cancer cells.
Using a two-layer chamber, we observed TGFβ-induced
invasion by the human prostate cancer PC-3U cells
(Figure  5A) and breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 5B), in line with our previous reports [12, 13].
By contrast, silencing of APPL1 and APPL2 resulted in a
decrease in TGFβ-induced invasion of by both these cell
lines. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) analysis showed that transcription of the
cancer-associated matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) and
MMP9 decreased after silencing of APPL1 and APPL2
(Figure 5C). Treatment of PC-3U cells with 1 μM of the
MMP2 and MMP9 inhibitor SB-3CT inhibited invasion in
response to TGFβ stimulation of cells (Figure 5D). These
findings support the notion that APPL-promoted nuclear

normal prostate tissue, APPL1 was expressed only in
basal epithelial cells but not in luminal cells, whereas in
malignant prostate tissues APPL1 was expressed in all
cancer cells (Figure 6A–6C). APPL1 was also expressed
in all epithelial cells in high-grade prostate intraepithelial
neoplasia (HGPIN), suggesting that APPL1 participates
in prostate cancer progression (Figure  6A). We also
found that APPL1 staining, both in the cytoplasm and the
nucleus, positively correlated with higher Gleason Score
which is correlated to more aggressive disease (Table 1).
As we observed that APPL1 promotes the transport
of TβRI-ICD to the nucleus of prostate cancer cells and

APPL1 expression is higher in malignant
prostate tissue than in normal prostate tissue
To further elucidate the role of APPL1 in
cancer, we examined the expression and localization
of APPL1 in normal and malignant prostate tissue by
immunohistochemistry, as aberrant endocytosis of
growth factor receptors has been found to be occur
during cancer initiation and progression  [35,  36]. In

that this is connected to invasiveness [12], we investigated
whether the APPL1-TβRI-ICD complex could be found
in prostate cancer tissues. Using PLA, we detected a
significantly higher number of APPL1-TβRI complexes
in sections from patients with aggressive prostate cancer
compared with less aggressive tumours (Figure 6D).

(Figure  5). APPL1 and APPL2  have been linked to
cell survival in vertebrate development and in human
glioma cells  [38,  39]. APPL−/− cells showed a reduced
migration capacity, and knockdown of APPL2 further
decreased the mobility of APPL1−/− cells [40]. In tissues
from prostate cancer, APPL1 expression was found to
correlate with tumour malignancy (Gleason Score),
indicating an important functional role for APPL1 in
tumourigenesis of prostate cancer (Figure 6). Interestingly,
the immunohistochemical localization of the APPL1
protein differed in healthy prostate tissue and malignant
prostate tissue (Figure  6). Increased levels of APPL
proteins in prostate cancer was also recently described
by another group (41). It has been shown that TβRI-ICD
associates with p300 and activates genes involved with
tumour invasion, such as MMP2 [12, 42]; here, we show
by knockdown of APPL proteins that the nuclear TβRIICD-APPL protein complex regulates MMP2 and MMP9
expression, which could promote cancer cell invasion
(Figure 5C, 5D).
The precise mechanism whereby the APPL1-TβRIICD complex enters the nucleus needs to be further
explored, as APPL1 does not contain any obvious nuclear
localization signal. A possible nuclear localization signal
in APPL2 has recently been observed in silico [43], but
its functional role has not been tested experimentally. It
is known that APPL1 dissociates from early endosomes
when APPL1 endosomes mature  [22] and that APPL1
accumulates in the nucleus in response to EGF  [23],
although the molecular mechanisms behind this nuclear
translocation event remain to be elucidated. TβRI-ICD
formation and nuclear transport have been shown to be
dependent on TRAF6, importin β1 and nucleolin [44, 45].
In this study, we found that TGFβ induces PI3Kdependent maturation of endosomes and Lys63-linked
polyubiquitination of APPL1 in a TRAF6-dependent
manner, promoting the nuclear translocation of APPL1
and TβRI-ICD. Future studies aiming at elucidating
the detailed mechanisms for nuclear translocation
of the APPL1-TβRI-ICD complex and their nuclear
transcriptional targets besides MMP2 and MMP9,  are
warranted, to better understand the protumorigenic effects
of TGFβ.
In conclusion, our study has identified APPL-positive
endosomes as a transient early endocytotic compartment

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have identified a role for APPL1
and APPL2 proteins in the trafficking of TβRI-ICD to
the nucleus. APPL1 interacts with TβRI in a TRAF6
dependent manner and the interaction is mediated by
its C-terminus. The resulting protein complex localizes
to a subpopulation of early endosomes that is important
for the nuclear translocation of TβRI-ICD. We also
found that the TGFβ-induced invasion of cancer cells
is dependent on APPL1 and APPL2 expression and that
the APPL1 expression is increased in malignant prostate
cancer tissues compared with normal prostate tissues.
Interestingly, we also observed a greater number of
APPL1-TβRI complexes in more aggressive prostate
cancer tissues. Taken together, these observations suggest
that the endosomal proteins APPL1 and APPL2 are
important for the nuclear trafficking of TβRI-ICD, which
is regulated by TRAF6 and is linked to prostate cancer
progression.
APPL proteins are multifunctional adaptors proteins
which associate with signalling molecules, such as PI3K,
to facilitate endocytosis of various receptors [21, 22]. In
this way, the APPL proteins may provide platforms for
directing downstream signalling pathways. Moreover,
both APPL1 and APPL2 translocate into the nucleus from
the cytosol in response to EGF stimulation, to regulate
cell proliferation [23, 37]. Our finding that APPL proteins
interact with TβRI-ICD to promote its intracellular
trafficking now expands the roles of APPL proteins to
TGFβ signalling.
Nuclear TβRI-ICD, which has been observed in
cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro [12], associates with
the transcriptional co-regulator p300 to activate genes
involved in cancer cell invasion  [12]. The functional
importance of nuclear TβRI-ICD is supported here by
the finding that TGFβ-induced cancer cell invasion was
suppressed after knockdown of APPL1 and APPL2

that is crucial for trafficking of TβRI-ICD. We observed
that nuclear translocation of the APPL1-TGFβRI-ICD
complex correlated with an increased expression of the
MMP2 and MMP9 genes. Moreover, a greater number of
APPL1-TβRI-ICD complexes were detected in sections
from aggressive human prostate cancer tissues compared
with less aggressive tumours, suggesting that increased
expression of APPL1 could provoke alternative TGFβ
signalling routes resulting in cancer progression. Future
studies in larger clinical materials will be important to
evaluate the clinical value of the herein reported APPL1TβRI-ICD complex as a potential prognostic marker in
tissues from patients with cancer.

machine was purchased from Licor Biosciences. Protein-G
Sepharose and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were
from GE Healthcare. Pefabloc was from Roche, and the
PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder was from Fermentas.
The PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μM) was purchased
from Calbiochem and wortmannin (100 nM) was from Sigma.
The MMP2 and MMP9 inhibitor SB-3CT was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The inhibitors were added
1 h before TGFβ stimulation, with exception of the experiment
in Figure 4B, in which the cells were treated with wortmannin
for 6 h before TGFβ stimulation.

Protein analysis
For the TGFβ stimulation experiments, cells were
starved for 12–18 h and then treated with TGFβ for the
indicated time periods. Cells were washed twice with
ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in
ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH
8.0, 0.5% (v/v) DOC, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
1 mM aprotinin, 1 mM Pefabloc and 2 mM sodium
orthovanadate). After centrifugation, the supernatants were
collected and the protein concentrations were measured
using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).
Equal amounts of protein from each total cell lysate were
subjected to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated
proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 7% or
10% Bis-Tris Precast gels (Life Technologies), MiniPROTEAN TGX gels and Criterion TGX Precast gels
(Bio-Rad), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and
subjected to immunoblotting as described previously [47].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
The investigation has been conducted in accordance
with the ethical standards and according to the Declaration
of Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board.

Cell culture
The PC-3U human prostatic carcinoma cell line
represents a clone from the original PC-3 cell line (ATCC
CRL-1435). The PC-3U cells was grown in RPMI-1640 with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine [46].
The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 used
in this study was purchased from ATCC (ATCC CRMHTB-26), and cells were grown in L15 media with 15%
FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. For TGFβ stimulation, TGFβ
(5 ng/ml) was added in medium containing 1% FBS to cells
that had been starved for 12–18 h.

Nuclear fractionation assay
After starvation and stimulation with TGFβ1, PC-3U
cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and scraped
in ice-cold PBS. After centrifugation for 5 min at 2000
rpm at 4°C the supernatant was discarded. The pellets
were treated with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM
morpholine ethanesulfonic acid (MES; pH 6.2), 10 mM
NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. After
a second centrifugation step the supernatant containing
the cytoplasmic part was removed. The remaining nuclear
pellet was washed three times with ice-cold washing
buffer (same as lysis buffer but without Triton X-100),
and then dissolved in an ice-cold extraction buffer
(25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 10.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl,
5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100). Both the
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were then centrifuged
at 13,000 rpm [48].

Antibodies and reagents
The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting,
immunoprecipitation (IP), or immunofluorescence (IF).
Antibodies against APPL1 (dilution 1:1,  000), Lamin A
(1:1, 000), p-PKCζ/λ (Thr410/403, 1:1, 000), p-p38 (1:1, 000),
p38 (1:1,  000) and SMAD2 (1:1,  000) were purchased
from Cell Signaling; p-SMAD2 (1:500) was generated
in rabbits in-house; APPL2 (1:500), TβRI (V22,  1:500)
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The V22
antibody recognizes nuclear TβRI-ICD and its specificity
was reported previously [12]; antibodies against HA (2 μg for
IP), and β-actin and β-tubulin were from Roche and Sigma,
respectively. APPL1 antibody for the PLA experiments
was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas
Alexafluor 555 and 488 were from Invitrogen, and Lys63
polyubiquitin antibody from Enzo Life Science. Horseradish
peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were purchased
from Sigma, and the secondary antibody for Odyssey Clx

plated on coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 30 min, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 5 min at room temperature and then blocked with
10 mM glycine. Incubation with the primary antibodies
was performed for 1 h at room temperature, followed by
washing in PBS and then incubation with the secondary
antibodies. Photomicrographs were obtained using
a confocal microscope LSM 710 (Carl Zeiss) using a
63 × 1.4/ NA objective lens (Carl Zeiss). The images were
acquired using the Zen 2010 software in the presence of
immersion oil at room temperature.

lower well of the invasion plate was filled with 500 μl
RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. After incubation
for 24 hours, non-invasive cells were removed from the
interior of the inserts. Invasive cells were photographed
using an Olympus BX50 microscope with a 20 × /0.5
objective length after staining with Cell Stain Solution.
The images were acquired using CellA software at room
temperature, using an Olympus XC30 camera. Each
insert was treated with 200  μl of Extraction Solution
for 10 minutes. Optical density (OD) at 560 nm was
measured in a plate reader.

In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)

Plasmids

PC-3U cells were treated, or not, with TGFβ for
30 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized
in 0.2% Triton X-100. For brightfield PLA analysis, the
tissue sections were pretreated with deparaffinization,
retrieval and permeabilization. In situ proximity ligation
assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions with the Duolink Detection Kit (Sigma).
Photomicrographs for immunofluorescence were taken
with an AX10 microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a 40 × 0.95/
NA objective lens (Carl Zeiss). The images were acquired
with Zen 2 pro software at room temperature. The camera
was a Hamamatsu Digital Camera C11440. Images for
brightfield were acquired with Pannoramic 250 Flash.

A plasmid encoding C-terminally HA-tagged
constitutively active (ca) TβRI was a kind gift from
Peter ten Dijke (Department of Molecular Cell Biology
and Center for Biomedical Genetics, Leiden University
Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands). Plasmids
encoding GFP-tagged APPL1,  YFP-tagged APPL1
(Δ1–272), and GFP-tagged APPL1 ΔC (Δ320–709)
have been used before [23]. The GFP-TβRI plasmid was
described before [12].

siRNA transfection
On TARGET plus siRNA for APPL1 (target
sequence: 5′ GGAAAUGGACAGUGAUAUA 3′), APPL2
(target sequence: 5′ AGAUCUACCUGACCGACAA 3′)
siRNA, TRAF6 (target sequence: 5′ GGCCAUAGG
UUCUGCAAAG 3′) and non-targeting control siRNA
(sequences: 5′ UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA 3′;
5′UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUAC 3′; AUGUAUUG
GCCUGUAUUAG 3′; 5′ AUGAACGUGAAUUGCU
CAA 3′) were obtained from Dharmacon Research
(Lafayette, CO, USA). The siRNA was transfected
into cells using Oligofectamine Transfection Reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

In vitro binding assays
Purified GST-tagged APPL1 (Abnova) or
recombinant GST, as a control, were immobilized on
the glutathione Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in
buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mM
EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM
phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 M NaCl),
at 4°C overnight. The beads were washed three times
with buffer 1, and one time in Buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM GaCl2, 0.1%
NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.1 M NaCl), then
incubated with purified His-tagged TβRI-ICD or with
lysates of HEK 293 cells transfected with HA-tagged
TβRI-ICD at 4°C for 2 hours. After washing four times
with buffer 1, the beads were collected and tested for the
bound proteins by immunoblotting with anti-His or antiHA antibody.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from PC-3U cells with
an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Thermoscript RTPCR (Invitrogen) was used for cDNA synthesis. qRTPCR was performed with the Applied Biosystems
7900HT Fast Real-time PCR system and Power
SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) was used for
detection of PCR products. The following primers
were used for qRT-PCR: MMP2,  forward primer (FP),
AGGCCGACATCATGGTACTC, reverse primer (RP),
GGTCAGTGCTGGAGAAGGTC; MMP9,  FP, GCCC
TTCTACGGCCACTACT, RP, TCAAAGACCGAGTC
CAGCTT; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), FP, TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG,
RP, TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTGGGCCAT. GAPDH was
used as an internal control.

Invasion assay
For invasion assays, we used Corning® BioCoat™
Matrigel® Invasion Chamber (Corning, Discovery
Labware, Bedford, US). The collagen layer of the
cell culture inserts was rehydrated by adding 500  μl
of serum-free RPMI-1640 to the inner compartment,
and 1 × 105 cells were seeded inside of each insert in
serum-free RPMI-1640 with or without TGFβ. The

assays, quantitive RT-PCR and Brightfield PLA on
tissue sections. Y.M. performed immunofluorescence
experiments, in vitro binding assays, immunofluorescence
PLA and Brightfield PLA on cells. M.L investigated the
immunostaining on the tissue sections and supervised
the project. All the authors analyzed, discussed data and
prepared the manuscript.

The tissue slides were deparaffinized in
dimethylbenzene, rehydrated through graded alcohols,
and incubated in acidic (R&D) and Hot Rinse (Biocare
Medical) for antigen retrieval in the Retriever 2100
(Proteogenix). After washing in running water, the slides
were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol
for 10 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase. After
incubation in 5% goat serum, the sections were incubated
overnight at 4°C in primary antibody diluted in 5% goat
serum. APPL1 antibody (Cell Signaling) was used at a
1:100 dilution. After washing with PBS, the slides were
incubated with secondary antibody (Envision™ System,
Dako) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sections
were washed and developed with DAB Quanto (Thermo
Scientific) under microscopic control. The reaction was
stopped with tap water, and the sections were stained
with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Images
were acquired with Pannoramic 250 Flash. An ethical
permit to use tumour tissues for generation of tissue
slides was provided by the Umeå Ethical Review Board
in full agreement with the Swedish Ethical Review Act
(540/03, Dnr 03–482).
