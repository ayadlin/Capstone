Abstract
Aberrant adhesion signaling pathways in cancer cells underlie their deadly invasive capabilities. The
adhesion-related PDZ adapter protein mda-9/syntenin is a positive regulator of cancer cell progression
in breast cancer, melanoma, and other human cancers. In this study, we report that mda-9/syntenin mediates
adhesion-mediated activation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by fibronectin
(FN) in human breast cancer and melanoma cells. FN rapidly stimulated the expression of mda-9/syntenin
and the activation of PKCα prior to activation of FAK. Inhibiting PKCα suppressed basal or FN-induced
expression of mda-9/syntenin, as well as cell migration and invasion toward FN stimulated by mda-9/syntenin.
Several lines of evidence suggested that activation of PKCα and expression of mda-9/syntenin were interdependent. First, mda-9/syntenin inhibition suppressed basal or FN-induced phosphorylation of PKCα at Thr638/641,
whereas PKCα inhibition suppressed basal or FN-induced expression of mda-9/syntenin. Second, inhibiting
either mda-9/syntenin or PKCα suppressed FN-induced formation of integrin-β1/FAK/c-Src signaling complexes. Third, inhibiting either mda-9/syntenin or PKCα suppressed FN-induced phosphorylation of FAK
Tyr397 and c-Src Tyr416 and the induction of downstream effector signals to p38 and mitogen-activated protein
kinase, Cdc42, and NF-κB. In summary, our findings offer evidence that mda-9/syntenin acts as a molecular
adaptor linking PKCα and FAK activation in a pathway of FN adhesion by human breast cancer and melanoma cells. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1645–55. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
PDZ domain–containing proteins are ubiquitous scaffolding proteins that are involved in the organization of multiprotein complexes at the membrane (1, 2). mda-9/syntenin
is a 32-kDa protein that is made up of a 113-amino-acid
NH2-terminal domain with no obvious structural motifs, followed by two adjacent tandem PDZ domains (PDZ1 and
PDZ2) and a short 24-amino-acid COOH-terminal domain
(3). The PDZ domains of mda-9/syntenin are essential for
the assembly and organization of diverse cell signaling processes occurring at the plasma membrane (4, 5) and bind to
multiple peptide motifs with low to medium affinity (6, 7).
This plasticity allows mda-9/syntenin to participate in mulAuthors' Affiliations: 1Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural

tiple biological functions, including receptor clustering, protein trafficking, and activation of the transcription factor
Sox4 (4, 5).
Our lab and others have shown that mda-9/syntenin is
overexpressed in several cancer cells and tissues and may
regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis (8–12). mda-9/
syntenin displays preferential association with fibronectin
(FN) signaling in human melanoma cells (8–10). mda-9/
syntenin is colocalized with focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
and facilitates FN-induced phosphorylation of FAK, with
subsequent activation of p38 and c-jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases (8, 10). Activation
of FAK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase by
mda-9/syntenin leads to activation of nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB; ref. 10). mda-9/syntenin may directly interact with
c-Src, and this interaction correlates with increased formation of active FAK/c-Src signaling complexes (9) important
for regulating the migration machinery (13).
Integrins are α and β heterodimeric cell-surface receptors
that mediate cell extracellular matrix proteins (14). Ligand
binding to the extracellular integrin domain induces conformational changes and integrin clustering for activation
of signaling cascades and recruitment of multiprotein
complexes to focal adhesions (15). Subsequently, integrins
lacking kinase activity transmit messages through a variety
of intracellular protein kinases and adaptor molecules such

as FAK and paxillin (16, 17). FAK is a nonreceptor tyrosine
kinase that regulates signal transduction at sites of integrin-mediated cell adhesions (18, 19). Clustering of integrins
facilitates the autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 through
undefined mechanisms (20). Integrin-stimulated autophosphorylation creates a high-affinity binding site for the Srchomology 2 domain of Src family tyrosine kinases, and this
interaction promotes Src kinase activity through a conformational change (21, 22). Activated c-Src binds to phosphorylated FAK at Tyr397 and then phosphorylates additional
sites on FAK, which promotes the assembly of distinct and
higher-order individual signaling complexes, thereby providing a mechanism for coordinating signaling through multiple
pathways (19). In many signaling contexts, the FAK-Src
complex controls cell shape and focal contact turnover
events during cell motility (18, 19, 23). Protein kinase C
(PKC) also regulates integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation and focal adhesion formation in many cell types
(24–28). In particular, PKCα seems to be a key intermediate
between integrins and FAK signaling. PKCα activation is
upstream FAK phosphorylation in response to FN. Inhibition of PKCα suppresses focal adhesion formation, cell
migration, and FAK phosphorylation at Tyr 397 during
adhesion to FN (26, 29–31). However, the mechanism
by which links between PKCα activation and FAK phosphorylation remains poorly understood.
Here, we report that the expression of mda-9/syntenin
and activation of PKCα are interdependently regulated.
Moreover, upregulation of mda-9/syntenin by PKCα facilitated the formation of the FN-induced assembly of signaling complexes including integrin β1, FAK, and c-Src, which
activate the FAK and FAK signaling pathways in MDA-MB231 and C8161 cells. Our findings suggest that mda-9/syntenin may link PKCα and FAK activation and assemble
multimeric integrin-β1 signaling complexes to activate
FAK in response to FN.

T47D, and MDA-MB-231 were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640.
The human melanoma line C8161 was a gift from Dr. Danny R. Welch (The University of Alabama at Birmingham,

beads and antibodies for integrin β 1 , hemagglutinin
(HA), ErbB2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Actinomycin D, PP2, Gö6976, and rottlerin were from Calbiochem.
Fibronectin, poly-L-lysine, and collagen type I were from BD
Biosciences.
Plasmids and RNA interference. The expression vector
for Flag-tagged mda-9/syntenin was described previously
(11). The PKCα, PKCδ, dominant negative (DN)-PKCα, and
DN-PKCδ constructs were kindly provided by Dr. J.J. Lee
(KRIBB, Daejeon, Korea). The DN-Cdc42 construct was provided by Dr. K.Y. Lee (Chonnam National University, Kwangju, Korea). The expression vector for FAK-related nonkinase
(FRNK) was a generous gift from D. Jeoung (Kangwon
National University, Chuncheon, Korea). siRNAs for mda-9/
syntenin, syndecan-2, syndecan-4, and scramble control were
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transfections were done
using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invirogen).
Construction of mda-9/syntenin shRNA–producing vector. The pSUPER shRNA–producing plasmids (pSUPERmda-9/syntenin and pSUPER-Scramble) were constructed
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Oligoengine).
The following target sequences were used: mda-9/syntenin,
5′-GCAAGACCTTCCAGTATAA-3′; scramble control: 5′AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′. MDA-MB-231 cells were
transfected with pSUPER-mda-9/syntenin or pSUPER-Scramble using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent. Forty-eight hours
after transfection, the medium was changed with the culture
medium supplemented with 500 μg/mL G418 for selection of
stable transfectants.
Reverse transcription-PCR assays. To measure the RNA
levels for mda-9/syntenin and PKCα, we used the following primers: mda-9/syntenin, 5′-TGAAAACTGTGCAGGATGGA-3′
(sense) and 5′-ACCTCAGGAATGGTGTGGTC-3′ (antisense);
PKCα, 5′-TGTGCACCCCATCTTACAGGGTGCAGTATGA-3′
(sense) and 5′-TCATACTGCACCCTGTAAGATGGGGTGCACA-3′ (antisense). GAPDH was also amplified as the reference
gene using the following primers: 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′
(antisense).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Immnuoprecipitation and Western blotting were described previously (11, 32). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
5 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1% NP40, and protease
inhibitors cocktail (BD Biosciences)] and centrifuged at
15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. For immunoprecipitation,
equivalent amounts of cell lysates were incubated for 16 h
at 4°C with the appropriate antibodies, followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed, and the eluted
precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and
probed with the proper antibodies.
Cell fractionation. Cells were washed with PBS, incubated
in hypotonic lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.0),

orthovanadate, protease inhibitors cocktail], and lysed by
15 strokes of a prechilled 1-mL Dounce homogenizer with
a tight-fitting pestle. Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted
at 1,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The cytoplasmic fraction was
obtained by centrifuging the supernatants at 21,000 × g at 4°C
for 45 min, and the pellets containing cellular membranes
were washed three times in hypotonic lysis buffer and resuspended in lysis buffer.
Cell migration and invasion assays. Cell migration and
invasion assays were done as described previously (11, 32).
Briefly, cells were seeded in triplicate at a density of 5 ×
104 cells on the upper part of each chamber. Chambers were
incubated at 37°C for 4 h (for migration) or 12 h (for invasion). The cells that had migrated to the lower surface of
the filter were fixed with methanol. Then the cells were
stained and counted in at least five randomly selected microscopic fields (×100) per filter.
NF-κB reporter assays. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were
transfected with a NF-κB–responsive luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene) in combination with the indicated constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were
trypsinized and plated on poly-L-lysine– or FN-coated surface
in serum-free medium for 2 h. Luciferase assay was done using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The results
were normalized to the activity of renilla expressed by cotransfected Rluc gene under the control of a constitutive
promoter.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Cells
were rinsed once in PBS, fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.5%
Triton X-100. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation
with PBS containing 1% goat serum before incubating the
cells with the appropriate antibody. After four washes in
PBS, the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary Alexa 488 (for mda-9/syntenin) or goat anti-rabbit secondary Alexa 546 (for PKCα) for 1 h at room temperature
and mounted. F-actin was stained with rhodamine-labeled
phalloidin (Molecular probes) followed by four washes in
PBS. Confocal images were acquired by using a Zeiss
LSM510 META NLO inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss; Korea Basic Science Institute Chuncheon
Center) equipped with an external argon, HeNe laser, and
HeNe laser II. Using a C-Apochromat 63× (numerical aperture 1.2) water immersion objective (Zeiss), images were captured at the colony midsection.
CDC42 activity ELISA. A commercially available Cdc42
ELISA was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). Briefly, captured Cdc42 was
cross-linked to the plate and detected by sequential incubations with an anti-Cdc42 primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody. The
relative amount of bound Cdc42 was then measured by developing the plate with a horseradish peroxidase–sensitive
dye, stopping the development with dilute sulfuric acid,
and recording the absorbance at 490 nm using a microplate
reader.

Results
mda-9/syntenin expression is dependent on the activation of PKCα during adhesion to FN in MDA-MB-231 and
C8161 cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism of
mda-9/syntenin for inducing cell migration and invasion,
we analyzed the effect of FN stimulation on mda-9/syntenin
expression and PKCα, c-Src, and FAK activation in MDA-MB231 and C8161 cells (Fig. 1A), which have high endogenous
mda-9/syntenin expression levels (8, 11). mda-9/syntenin expression was significantly induced by FN stimulation. The expression level of mda-9/syntenin was increased within
30 min and reached a peak at 1 hour, and then this induction
returned to basal level 8 hours after FN stimulation. The levels of phospho-PKCα and total PKCα were also increased
after FN stimulation in a manner similar to mda-9/syntenin
induction. FAK Tyr 397 phosphorylation and c-Src Tyr416
phosphorylation were significantly induced 1 hour after FN
stimulation, suggesting that both mda-9/syntenin induction
and PKCα activation could precede FAK and c-Src activation. PKCδ, FAK, and c-Src expression and PKCδ phosphorylation levels were not modulated by FN stimulation. mda-9/
syntenin levels and PKCα phosphorylation were not changed
in response to collagen type I (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, FAK
phosphorylation was not significantly increased by collagen
type I stimulation.
mda-9/syntenin mRNA expression was not altered after
FN stimulation, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Furthermore, pretreatment
with actinomycin D did not change mda-9/syntenin and
PKCα protein expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Rottlerin, a selective PKCδ inhibitor, or PP2, a selective
Src kinase inhibitor, also did not significantly change FNinduced expression of mda-9/syntenin (Fig. 1C, top). In contrast, Gö6976, a selective inhibitor of PKCα, suppressed FNinduced mda-9/syntenin expression (Fig. 1C, top). Similarly,
transfection of DN of PKCα blocked FN-induced mda-9/
syntenin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C, bottom),
suggesting that FN-induced mda-9/syntenin expression
can be regulated at the posttranscriptional level in a
PKCα-dependent manner.
mda-9/syntenin overexpression into MCF-7 cells induced
cell migration toward FN, but this effect was blocked
by the DN of PKCα, Cdc42, and FAK, but not by PKCδ
(Fig. 1D, left). Similarly, invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells
was also significantly suppressed by the DN of PKCα, Cdc42,
FAK, and mda-9/syntenin siRNA (Fig. 1D, right). These results
suggest that PKCα may regulate mda-9/syntenin–induced
signaling in response to FN in these cells.
PKCα mediates mda-9/syntenin expression. Forced expression of DN of PKCα into MDA-MB-231 or C8161 cells resulted in a significant suppression of the endogenous
expression of mda-9/syntenin (Fig. 2A). Moreover, PKCα

phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells was higher than that
in T47D and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2B), which have low endogenous mda-9/syntenin expression (11), suggesting that PKCα

levels of PKCα phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Taken together,
these results suggest that PKCα and mda-9/syntenin could
be interdependently regulated in these cell lines.
mda-9/syntenin mediates FN-induced activation of
PKCα. Transfection of C8161 cells with mda-9/syntenin
siRNA, but not control siRNA, blocked FN-induced increases
in PKCα phosphorylation, but did not change PKCδ phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Similarly for MDA-MB-231 cells, mda-9/
syntenin siRNA also blocked FN-induced phosphorylation
of PKCα (Fig. 3B). Membrane targeting of PKCα is critical
for PKCα activation (33). mda-9/syntenin shRNA blocked
FN-induced membrane targeting of PKCα, but control
shRNA did not, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining

(Fig. 3C, left). We further confirmed this result with membrane fractionation (Fig. 3C, right), where knockdown of
mda-9/syntenin again blocked the membrane targeting of
PKCα after FN stimulation. Notably, most of mda-9/syntenin
was detected in the membrane fraction on FN stimulation.
Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that mda-9/syntenin
physically associated with PKCα, but not with PKCδ, in
HEK293T/17 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2), and FN increased
this association in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3D, left). Double
immunofluorescence revealed that colocalization of mda-9/
syntenin with PKCα was significantly increased by FN stimulation (Fig. 3D, right). These results indicate that mda-9/syntenin could regulate FN-induced activation of PKCα.

Either mda-9/syntenin or PKCα regulates FN-induced
phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397. Treatment with mda-9/
syntenin siRNA, but not control siRNA, blocked FN-induced
FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells induced

by plating on FN (Fig. 4A). In contrast, MCF-7 cells stably
transfected with mda-9/syntenin increased FN-induced FAK
Tyr397 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Next, we tested whether
PKCα influenced FN-induced FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation.

(bottom) were plated onto FN for

Indeed, pretreatment with Gö6976 significantly suppressed
FAK phosphorylation induced by FN, but rottlerin did not
(Fig. 4C). Similarly, forced expression of DN of PKCα suppressed FN-induced FAK phosphorylation, but the DN of
PKCδ did not (Fig. 4D). Our results suggest that mda-9/syntenin may mediate FN-induced FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation in a
PKCα-dependent manner, and that mda-9/syntenin and PKCα
could function as upstream regulators of FAK activation.
Either mda-9/syntenin or PKCα regulates FN-induced
integrin β1/FAK/c-Src associations. Integrin β1 immunoprecipitated from unstimulated MDA-MB-231 cells weakly
associated with FAK, c-Src, and mda-9/syntenin (Fig. 5A).
However, FN stimulation increased the integrin-β1 association with FAK, c-Src, and mda-9/syntenin, and mda-9/syntenin siRNA blocked this effect (Fig. 5A). FN stimulation also
increased the FAK association with integrin β1, c-Src, and

fect (Fig. 5B). Similarly, forced expression of DN of PKCα impaired the formation of FN-induced integrin-β1 association
with FAK, c-Src, and mda-9/syntenin (Fig. 5C), as well as
FAK association with integrin β1, c-Src, and mda-9/syntenin
(Fig. 5D). These results suggest that mda-9/syntenin could
regulate FN-induced formation of signaling complexes, including integrin β1, FAK, and c-Src, through PKCα-mediated
upregulation.

blocked FN-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 6D). These results further confirmed that mda-9/syntenin and PKCα
could be critical regulators of FAK activation in response
to FN.

Discussion
The major conclusions of this study are as follows: (a)
mda-9/syntenin and PKCα activation are significantly

induced before FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation during adhesion
to FN; (b) upregulation of mda-9/syntenin and activation of
PKCα are interdependent, that is, inhibition of PKCα suppressed both FN-induced and endogenous expression of
mda-9/syntenin, and vice versa; (c) inhibition of mda-9/syntenin or PKCα completely suppressed both the association of
integrin β1/FAK/c-Src signaling complexes and the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 and c-Src at Tyr416; and (d)
mda-9/syntenin and PKCα inhibition suppressed FN-induced
cell migration and invasion, as well as FAK-mediated signaling pathways. Collectively, our results provide the first evidence that mda-9/syntenin and PKCα are interdependently
regulated, and PKCα-dependent upregulation of mda-9/syntenin could facilitate the associations of integrin β1/FAK/cSrc signaling complexes during adhesion to FN, leading to
FAK and c-Src activation.

Syntenin Regulates Fibronectin-Induced FAK Activation

We showed that upregulation of mda-9/syntenin and activation of PKCα are interdependent, that is, inhibition of
PKCα suppresses FN-induced and endogenous expression
of mda-9/syntenin and inhibition of mda-9/syntenin impairs FN-induced activation of PKCα. Modulation of
mda-9/syntenin expression by siRNA or overexpression significantly affected the activation of PKCα, FAK, and c-Src.
Inhibition of PKCα also significantly suppressed FN-induced
activation of FAK and c-Src, as well as mda-9/syntenin expression. Moreover, mda-9/syntenin and PKCα regulated
the FN-induced association of integrin β1/FAK/c-Src signaling complexes. Therefore, FN-induced activation of PKCα induces the expression of mda-9/syntenin, which in turn could
induce FAK activation by facilitating the formation of integrin β1/FAK/c-Src signaling complexes. mda-9/syntenin may
act as a molecular adaptor that links PKCα and FAK during
adhesion to FN.

PKCα is essential for integrin-mediated adhesion, migration, and signaling events through participation in integrin
β1–associated protein complexes downstream of FN (28–
31, 34). In particular, binding of integrin α5β1 to FN activates
PKCα, and inhibition of PKCα, but not PKCδ, suppresses
focal adhesion formation and cell migration mediated by
α5β1 (31). FN binding to integrin α5β1 requires a proteoglycan coreceptor, syndecan-4, for focal adhesion formation and
cell migration (29–31). Syndecan-4–dependent activation of
PKCα is essential for focal adhesion formation and cell migration in cells that adhere to FN through integrin α5β1 (31).
Consistent with these previous reports, our results showed
that inhibition of PKCα significantly suppressed FN-induced
cell migration and activation of FAK in MDA-MB-231 and
C8161 cells. Moreover, downregulation of syndecan-4 by
siRNA impaired FN-induced activation of PKCα and FAK
as well as mda-9/syntenin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells

(Supplementary Fig. S5), confirming that syndecan-4–dependent PKCα activation is essential for the activation of FAK
during adhesion to FN in these cell lines. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that syndecan-4–dependent activation of
PKCα induces mda-9/syntenin expression, which in turn
facilitates FN-induced activation of FAK.
These findings raise intriguing questions about how mda9/syntenin activates PKCα, which in turn regulates the expression of mda-9/syntenin and facilitates the associations
of integrin β1/FAK/c-Src signaling complexes. Syndecan-4
cytoplasmic domain binds both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and PKCα and may potentiate the activation of PKCα (29, 35). mda-9/syntenin was originally
identified as a binding protein for the cytoplasmic domain
of syndecan including syndecan-4 (36). PDZ domains of
mda-9/syntenin can bind to PIP2 (37). Point mutations of
amino acids required for PIP2-binding completely abolish
mda-9/syntenin–induced cell invasion, suggesting that the
binding of mda-9/syntenin and PIP2 could play a critical role
in mda-9/syntenin–induced signaling activation (12). PKCα
can bind to PIP2 through its C2 domain for plasma membrane localization (38, 39). Our results showed that mda-9/
syntenin could physically associate with PKCα, and FN
stimulation significantly increased the association between
mda-9/syntenin and PKCα. Moreover, inhibition of mda-9/
syntenin impaired the plasma membrane targeting of PKCα.
Therefore, mda-9/syntenin may facilitate the binding of
PKCα to PIP2 through the formation of mda-9/syntenin/syndecan-4/PKCα complexes at the plasma membrane after FN
attachment. Inhibition of PKCα suppressed both endogenous
and FN-induced expression of mda-9/syntenin. Expression of
mda-9/syntenin is probably regulated by a positive feedback
mechanism from PKCα activation. Further studies are needed to fully understand how mda-9/syntenin activates PKCα,
which in turn regulates the expression of mda-9/syntenin.
We here showed that mda-9/syntenin regulates the associations of integrin β1, FAK, and c-Src, and it may function as
an adaptor for the assembly of integrin-β1 signal complexes

including FAK and c-Src during adhesion to FN. Consequently, the increased expression of mda-9/syntenin would result
in the increase of its ability to assemble with sufficient efficiency to integrin β1–associated signaling complexes, leading
to activation of FAK and c-Src, and would therefore have a
profound effect on integrin β1-FAK signaling pathways. The
detailed mechanisms by which mda-9/syntenin assembles
the FN-induced integrin-β1 signaling complexes remain to
be elucidated.
In summary, activation of PKCα induces expression of
mda-9/syntenin, which in turn enhances the FN-induced assembly of integrin-β1 signaling complexes with FAK and cSrc, activating FAK and its downstream pathways. This
may explain the relationship between activation of PKCα
and formation of focal adhesions to FN (28–31). Our findings
also support the hypothesis that mda-9/syntenin functions as
an adaptor protein for the FN-induced assembly of multimeric signaling complexes clustered at high concentrations
on the plasma membrane. The activated mda-9/syntenin/
PKCα/integrin-β1/FAK/c-Src complexes may then enhance
cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Targeted therapies
that inactivate the mda-9/syntenin/PKCα/integrin-β1/FAK/
c-Src complexes may provide a rational molecular approach
to improve the prognosis of cancer patients.
