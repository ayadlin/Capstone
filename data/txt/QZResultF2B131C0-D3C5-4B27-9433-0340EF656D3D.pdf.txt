ABSTRACT:
Activating mutations of KIT receptor tyrosine kinase have been reported in
different neoplasms. The M541L KIT substitution (KITM541L) has been described to be
associated with pediatric mastocytosis, to enhance growth rate of the affected cells
and to confer higher sensitivity to imatinib therapy. We investigated the presence of
KITM541L in five males with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL,
NOS), all negative for Platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFR) or PDGFRbeta
abnormalities, which responded to imatinib therapy. To assess whether the mutation
was constitutive or somatic in nature, we evaluated its presence analyzing either the
neoplastic or normal cell population (epidermal cells or CD3-positive T lymphocytes).
KITM541L substitution was found in 4 out of 5 patients and in all it was somatic in nature.
All patients were treated with low dose imatinib (100 mg daily orally), achieving
complete and persistent clinical and hematological remission (median follow-up 74
months). One patient relapsed after 50 months. Our study strongly suggests to search
for the KITM541L in patients with CEL, NOS, negative for PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta
abnormalities, to identify a subgroup of cases who may benefit from low dose imatinib
therapy.

INTRODUCTION

pruritus, bruising, and signs of organ damage, including
lung, heart, central and peripheral nervous system, and
gastrointestinal tract. According to the update WHO
classification (2008), the group of hypereosinophilic
syndromes (HES) encompasses myeloid and lymphoid
neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormality of
PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta, or FGFR1, chronic
eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL,
NOS) and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES)

Hypereosinophilic syndromes are a rare and
heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by
hypereosinophilia (peripheral blood eosinophils greater
than 1500/µl), lasting for longer than 6 months, and
clinical manifestation related to eosinophil accumulation,
either reactive or neoplastic, within different tissues.
Clinical features are represented by fatigue, weight loss,

[1]. Almost all patients bearing FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha or
TEL/PDGFRbeta, rearrangements respond to tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but a striking hematologic
response can also be observed in about one third of
patients lacking those genetic lesions [2,3]. Recently,
we described a case of hypereosinophilic syndrome with
features of CEL, NOS, carrying the KITM541L variant
and showing a good response to low-dose imatinib [4].
In this context an association between the KIT exon 10
variants and the clinical response of CEL, NOS to targeted
treatment by imatinib was suggested.
Activating mutations of the KIT receptor tyrosine
kinase, whose gene is mapped to human chromosome
4q12, have been reported in different neoplasms either
hematological (e.g. acute myeloid leukemia, systemic
mastocytosis) or non hematological (e.g. gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, germ cell tumors, melanoma) [5-9].
Together with activating mutations, sequence
variations (polymorphisms) of the KIT gene have been
also described (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cgi?locusId=3815).
Among them, the M541L variant (KITM541L) has
been reported to be associated with pediatric mastocytosis,
to heighten growth response to low levels (< 10 ng/
ml) of Stem-cell Factor (SCF) of the cells carrying this
substitution, and to confer higher sensitivity to imatinib
[10].
On the basis of these observations we investigated
the presence of the KITM541L substitution in a cohort of
CEL,NOS patients who proved negative for PDGFRalpha,
PDGFRbeta rearrangements, and nevertheless had showed
a rapid and robust response to low dose imatinib.

RESULTS
The main clinical and molecular features of the 5
patients analyzed in this study are summarized in table
1 and table 2. They were all male, with a median age at
diagnosis of 48 years (range: 18-70 years) and diagnosed
as chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified

according to the WHO classification [1]. Cytogenetic
analysis, performed on bone marrow aspirate, revealed
a normal karyotype in 2 patients (#4 and #5), while
the presence of chromosomal abnormalities was
documented in 3 patients. In particular, in patient number
3 we identified the presence of a translocation between
chromosomes 4 and 8. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization
(FISH) analysis performed on the same sample with
probes for chromosome 4 and 8 suggested the involvement
of q11 region on chromosome 4 and p11 region on
chromosome 8. Additional experiments for breakpoint
confirmation were not possible at that time.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was found
negative for the BCR/ABL1, FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha
fusion transcripts and for JAK2 mutations in all cases.
TEL/PDGFRbeta was analysed in 4 out of 5 patients
and resulted negative. Serum tryptase was within the
normal limits or only slightly elevated, but never at the
mastocytosis range (> 20 ng/ml). Bone marrow aspirates
and biopsies showed a slightly to moderate hypercellular
marrow, with normal or decreased erythropoiesis,
sometimes with associated diserythropoietic findings.
The granulopoietic series ranged from normal to slightly
increased, with a constantly higher number of mature
and immature eosinophils. Megakaryocytes were mature,
sometimes aggregated in loose clusters, with sparse
vesicular or hypolobulated nuclei. The percentage of
CD34-positive hematopoietic precursors was always less

than 20%. A few round mast cells (less than 5%), tryptasepositive, CD2 and CD25-negative, were sometimes
evident in the interstitial space or in perivascular areas.
Significant collagen fibrosis were absent in all the cases.
No evidence of myeloproliferative or other hematological
neoplasms was found in all the cases upon morphological
and immunohistochemical evaluation.
The molecular analysis showed the presence of the
KITM541L somatically acquired substitution in 4 out of 5
cases (#1, 2, 4 and 5).
Notably, we demonstrated all-heterozigous
nucleotide exchanges in the 4 patients carrying this genetic
variant. Moreover, this mutation was present only in the
neoplastic population while it was absent in epidermal
cells or T lymphocytes.
All these patients received a low-dose oral imatinib
treatment (100 mg daily) and achieved a complete and
persistent clinical and hematological remission. With a
median follow-up of 74 months (range: 12-120 months),
only one patient (numbered 4 in our series) relapsed after
50 months. No adverse events were observed during
imatinib therapy in all the patients. The quality of the
molecular response was checked during the follow up by
a direct KIT exon 10 sequencing which was performed on
genomic DNA obtained from the four CEL, NOS mutated
patients (Fig.1A). Within the limited sensitivity of this
assay (which may detect the mutation in no less than 10%
of the analyzed cells) the KITM541L was not detectable in

a higher sensitive approach (the ARMS assay, which may
detect this allele variant with a sensitivity close to 3%)

only in one patient (#4), (Fig.1B).

hyperheosinophilic syndrome negative for PDGFRalpha,
PDGFRbeta abnormalities, to identify an additional
subgroup of patients that may benefit from imatinib
therapy. Notably, our findings provide evidence that all
of the four treated patients positive for KITM541L displayed
a good response to low dose imatinib, supporting and
extending the relevant observations that juxtamembrane
KIT mutants display enhanced sensitivity to the kinaseinhibitory drug imatinib [15,16].
We are aware that our observations are limited due
to the low number of the investigated patients and the good
response to imatinib therapy obtained also for the single
patients without the KITM541L mutation. For these reasons
and considering that CEL, NOS is a rare disorders, further
studies with a higher number of patients are necessary to
estimate the real frequency of this mutation and the impact
of the imatinib therapy.

DISCUSSION
In this study we found the presence of a KITM541L
allele variant in four out of five CEL, NOS patients.
We were able to demonstrate the somatic nature of this
nucleotide substitution which was present only in the
neoplastic population, while it was absent in epidermal
cells or T lymphocytes. In addition, we found that
imatinib, which is effective in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha
rearrangement positive hypereosinophilic syndromes [11],
was highly effective also in cases bearing this KITM541L
variant. Finally these results have been observed using
a low dose imatinib as in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha positive
syndromes.
The intracellular tyrosine kinase activity of the
transmembrane receptor KIT (CD117), is stimulated
after binding of the ligand Stem cell Factor (SCF) to
extracellular domain. KIT is expressed in hematopoietic
progenitor cells, mast cells, interstitial cells of Cajal,
germ cells and melanocytes. Activating mutations
of this gene are considered to play a key role in the
pathogenesis of various myeloid neoplasms (including
acute myeloid leukemia and mastocytosis), characterized
by increasing eosinophil precursors that are part of the
malignant clone, but have not been found so far in primary
hypereosinophilic syndromes [12].
The KITM541L has been described as a polymorphic
variant with allele frequencies at heterozygous state
close to 20%. It has been suggested that the constitutive
expression of KITM541L variant confers a higher sensitivity
to imatinib in padiatric mastocytosis [10] and in aggressive
fibromatosis [13]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated the
presence of the KITM541L variant in cell line of Merkel-cell
carcinoma (MCC) and an autocrine stimulatory loop was
suggested between SCF and KIT in a MCC-1 cell line
which carries the M541L sequence variation [14].
Notably, we were able to demonstrate the somatic
nature of this substitution and that low-dose imatinib
was highly effective in cases of CEL, NOS bearing it.
These findings could explain the optimal and durable
responsiveness to imatinib treatment frequently reported
also in patients lacking any known TKI-sensitive genetic
lesions. Although this sequence variation has not been
suggested as a disease-causing mutation, the high
frequency of clinical association and the somatic nature
of the variants, suggest to reconsider the overall role of
KIT receptor and its variants in the evolution of chronic
eosinophilic leukemia.
Our data therefore strongly suggest to search
at diagnosis for the KITM541L in all the patients with

METHODS
We retrospectively collected data from five patients,
fulfilling the criteria for CEL, NOS according to the
updated WHO classification [1], followed between January
2003 and December 2012 at two Italian Hematological
Departments (IRCCS Ca’ Granda – Maggiore Policlinico
Hospital Foundation, Milan and Azienda Ospedaliera
Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy) which responded
to low-dose imatinib. These patients were submitted to an
extensive cytogenetic and molecular analysis including
BCR/ABL1, TEL/PDGFRbeta, FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha
translocations and JAK2 mutations. Moreover, c-KIT
analysis on exons 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 17 was also
performed. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies were
collected from all of these patients.

Cell separation and molecular analyses
Total nucleated cells (TNC) were collected from
peripheral blood or bone marrow by Hetasep (StemCell)
sedimentation. CD3 positive cells were purified from
whole peripheral blood by immuno-magnetic selection
using a commercial kit on a semi-automatic instruments
(Robosep, Stem Cell Technologies Inc. Vancouver,
Canada). Total RNA was extracted using a column
based system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and analyzed
for the presence of FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha [11], TEL/
PDGFRbeta [17] and BCR/ABL1 [18] fusion transcripts
as previously described. Genomic DNA was obtained
by a salting out method (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
following the manufacturer instructions. The presence of
the JAK2V617F mutation was studied on DNA samples
by allele specific PCR [19] and mutations in JAK2 exon
12 was explored by PCR amplification of the whole exon
12 followed by Sanger sequencing [20].

Isolation of genome DNA from polymorphonuclear
blood cells was performed using DNAzol reagent,
according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen,
San Paolo, Brazil).
The PCR amplification of c-KIT exons (8, 9, 10,
11, 17) was performed as previously described [12]. DNA
sequencing of purified PCR products was carried out
on an ABI PRISM 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Cycle sequencing
was conducted using 20 ng of purified PCR fragments.
Cycling conditions were as follows: 96°C for 1 min; 25
cycles at 96°C for 10 sec, 50°C for 5 sec; 60°C for 4 min.
The results were analyzed using the ChromasPro software
(version 1.41 Technelysium).
In order to assess whether KITM541L substitution
was constitutive or somatic in nature, we investigated its
presence in the 4 mutated patients (numbered 1, 2, 4, 5
in our series) also in the epidermal cells obtained from
healthy skin by punch biopsies (patients number 5), or in
CD3-positive T lymphocytes (patients 1, 2, and 4). All the
patients gave their informed consent.

The PCR method known as Amplification Refractory
Mutation System (ARMS) [21] was carried out on
genomic DNA obtained from CEL, NOS patients at follow
up. The target DNA (95 bp product) was amplified using
a couple of forward primers specific for the KIT 4894/C
(5’-ATGATGTGCATTATTGTGC-3’) genomic variant
or for the 4894/A (5’-ATGATGTGCATTATTGTGA-3’)
normal allele respectively, and a common reverse primer
(5’-TGTCAAGCAGAGAATGGGT-3’).
The amplification on the thermal cycler was carried
out consisting of 28 cycles: each cycle consisted of
denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, primer annealing at 64°C
for 15 sec and extension at 72°C for 20 sec. In the final
cycle the extension was prolonged for another 3 minutes.
The PCR products was visualized after electrophoresis on
a 2% agarose gel.
