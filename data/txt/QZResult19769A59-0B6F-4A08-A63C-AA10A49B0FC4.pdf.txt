Abstract:

Class III β-tubulin (β3) is associated with tumor aggressiveness, resistance to
therapy, and patient relapse. To elucidate its action, we tested β3’s effect on cell
migration. Expression of β3 in HeLa and MCF-7 did not alter the intrinsic rate of cell
migration, but it prevented the inhibition of migration by low, nontoxic concentrations
of paclitaxel. The effects on cell motility were confirmed in CHO cells with tetracycline
regulated expression of β3. Cell migration and microtubule dynamics were inhibited
by similar concentrations of paclitaxel, but required a 5-10 fold higher drug
concentration when β3 was expressed. The directionality of migration was normal
in paclitaxel, but cells spent more time in a “paused” state during which there
was no net movement. These studies support a model in which paclitaxel inhibits
cell migration by suppressing microtubule dynamics and β3-tubulin counteracts
paclitaxel action by maintaining microtubule dynamic activity. The results provide
a potential explanation for the resistance to therapy of β3-expressing tumors.

INTRODUCTION

Studies in cultured mammalian cells showed that cellular
microtubules incorporate all available β-tubulin isotypes
including ectopic and chimeric proteins with little or no
change to the microtubule network [4-7]. On the other
hand, studies in transgenic mice revealed an important
role for β6 in platelet function [8]. In our laboratory
we recently used tetracycline regulated expression to
examine the effects of ectopic β-tubulin cDNAs on cell
behavior. Our studies have shown that overexpression of
β1, β2, or β4b has no obvious effects on the transfected
cells [9], and that β4a overexpression has only subtle
effects on microtubule assembly and drug sensitivity [10].
In contrast, overexpression of the more divergent β5 and
β6 isotypes produces dramatic effects on cell division,
microtubule assembly, and cellular responses to drugs
that target the microtubule cytoskeleton [11, 12].
The β3 isotype falls between these extremes. Its
expression was reported to be increased in cell lines
selected for resistance to paclitaxel [13, 14]. We confirmed
its participation in paclitaxel resistance but showed that it
could only confer very weak resistance and that it acted
by reducing microtubule assembly [15]. Although β3 is

Microtubules form an important cytoskeletal
network involved in cell shape, vesicle transport, cell
motility, chromosome segregation, and cell division.
Cellular microtubules are composed of αβ-tubulin
heterodimers that assemble into linear protofilaments that
associate laterally to form hollow, tube-like structures.
The αβ heterodimers are added in a polarized fashion
resulting in asymmetric filaments whose fast growing
plus-ends are oriented towards the cell periphery while
their slow growing minus-ends remain embedded in the
centrosome near the cell center. Both α- and β-tubulin are
encoded by multiple genes that are expressed in a tissue
specific manner. In the case of β-tubulin, there are at least
7 vertebrate genes that produce distinct isotypes: β1, β2,
β3, β4a, β4b, β5, and β6. The β1, β4b, and β5 isotypes are
found in most mammalian tissues, whereas β2, β3, and
β4a are predominantly found in brain, and β6 is restricted
to platelets and megakaryocytes [1, 2].
The functional consequences of expressing different
tubulin genes have long been a subject of speculation [3].

Cells that produce β3-tubulin resist the inhibitory
effects of paclitaxel on cell migration

normally restricted to neuronal and Sertoli cells, it has
been found to be inappropriately expressed in tumor cells
from diverse tissues and its presence appears to correlate
with tumor aggressiveness and resistance to therapy [16,
17]. As a measure of tumor cell aggressiveness, we tested
the effects of β3 expression on the ability of paclitaxel to
inhibit cell migration.

We used the heterogeneity of β3 expression in MCF7
and HeLa cell lines as an advantage in order to assess the
effects of this isotype on cell motility. Cells were grown
on glass coverslips to about 85% confluence, a scratch was
made in the monolayer, and the movement of cells into the
wound was monitored by time lapse microscopy in the
presence and absence of paclitaxel using a concentration
that was one fifth of the cytotoxic IC50 value. Previous
studies indicated that this concentration of drug would be
effective at suppressing microtubule dynamics without
affecting mitosis [24]. We predicted that in the presence of

RESULTS
Neuron specific β3-tubulin is expressed in nonneuronal cancer cell lines
Cell migration is a complex process that involves
the microfilament and microtubule cytoskeletal systems
[18, 19]. We recently showed that concentrations of
microtubule inhibitors that are too low to affect cell division
are nevertheless efficient at suppressing microtubule
dynamics and inhibiting cell motility [20]. Because β3tubulin has been reported to inhibit paclitaxel’s ability to
suppress microtubule dynamics [21], we reasoned that β3
expression in tumor cells might affect the ability of drugs
like paclitaxel to inhibit cell motility. This in turn could
potentially account, at least in part, for the observation
that β3 expressing cells tend to be more aggressive and
less susceptible to therapy with microtubule targeted
drugs [16, 17].
To test this hypothesis, we screened several human
tumor cell lines for their expression of β3-tubulin using
both immunofluorescence and western blot analysis with
an antibody specific for the β3 isoform. As a control, we
used CHO cells that were previously shown to express
β1, β4b, and β5 tubulin, but not β3 [22, 23]. As shown
in Figure 1A, CHO cells (lane 1) failed to react with the
antibody; but MCF7 (lane 2), HeLa (lanfe 3), and DU145
(lane 4) cells, derived from human breast, cervical, and
prostate tumors respectively, showed the presence of
varying amounts of β3. Immunofluorescence microscopy
(Figure 1B) confirmed the presence of β3-tubulin in the
microtubules and further indicated that the staining varied
greatly on a cell-to-cell basis. For example, we estimated
that only 25% of the cells in the MCF7 cell population were
positive for β3; whereas HeLa was 40% positive. Only the
DU145 cells appeared mostly uniform for β3 production,
but even in that cell line, there were some negative
cells (arrows, Figure 1B). We also examined K562 and
KB3 cells but found no evidence for β3 production by
either western blot analysis or by immunofluorescence
microscopy (data not shown). The results confirmed the
presence of β3-tubulin in some, but not all, human tumor
cell lines.

drug, the migration of cells lacking β3 would be inhibited,
but β3-producing cells would continue to migrate and

become concentrated at the edge of the wound. Because
MCF7 cells migrate much more slowly than HeLa (5 versus
22 µm/h), cells were fixed and stained for fluorescence
microscopy at different time points (7 h for HeLa and 24
h for MCF7) that corresponded to an approximate 30%
closing of the wound. As anticipated, the β3-producing
cells in both cell lines became enriched at the edge of
the wound (Supplementary Figure 1A). To quantify the
results, β3 positive and negative cells at the edge of the
wound were counted in 20 microscopic fields chosen at
random in each of 3 independent experiments. The data
confirmed that there was an increased percentage of β3producing cells at the leading edge of the wound when
paclitaxel was present (Supplementary Figure 1B) and
indicated that β3 expression could be playing a significant
role in the inability of microtubule targeted drugs to halt
the migration of aggressive tumor cells.

Resistance to paclitaxel inhibition of motility is
due to β3-tubulin expression
Although the production of β3-tubulin appeared
to correlate with the insensitivity of cell migration to
paclitaxel suppression, it did not establish a cause and
effect relationship. Human tumor cell lines are notoriously
heterogeneous and the cells frequently differ by multiple
genetic changes that could influence their response to
paclitaxel treatment. Also, the cells were not uniform in
their level of β3 production (see Figure 1B). Thus, cells
with low production that might be sufficient to provide
resistance could potentially be scored as β3-negative and
thereby complicate the quantification of experiments such
as those shown in Supplementary Figure 1. To eliminate
these ambiguities, we turned to HAβ3-5, a cloned CHO cell
line, created by transfection with HA-tagged β3-tubulin
under the control of a tetracycline regulated promoter, that
exhibits homogenous expression of the β3 isotype when
the cells are grown in the absence of the antibiotic [15].
The parental CHO cells used to generate this cell line were
shown to have no detectable expression of β3 by antibody
binding (Figure 1A), 2D gel analysis [23], or sequencing
of expressed cDNAs for β-tubulin [22]. By combining
HAβ3-5 with wild-type cells, we created a wound healing
experiment similar to that shown in Supplementary
Figure 1A but with cells that were more clearly positive
Figure 2: Paclitaxel inhibition of cell migration. (A) A mixed culture of wild-type CHO cells and HAβ3-5 cells was scratched to

make a wound and the cells were allowed to migrate for 24 h in the absence or presence of 10 nM paclitaxel. The cells were then stained
for α-tubulin (red), HAβ3-tubulin (green), and DNA (blue). Arrows indicate the direction of movement. Bar, 50 µm. (B) Cells at the edge of
the wound were scored for the presence or absence of HAβ3 expression and the percentage of HAβ3 containing cells was calculated from
20 random fields each containing approximately 20 cells along the leading edge. The experiment was repeated 3 times. (C) In a separate
experiment, a pure culture was used to measure the rate of HAβ3-5 cell migration into a scratch wound with and without 10 nM paclitaxel
in the presence (open bar) and absence (solid bar) of tetracycline. (D) A transwell assay was used to measure the migration of cells from
the upper to the lower chamber over a 6 h period at various paclitaxel concentrations. The graph was generated by defining the number of
cells that migrated to the lower chamber at 0 nM paclitaxel as 100% and expressing the data for the other concentrations relative to the zero
control. Error bars, SD. *p < 0.05 relative to the WT control was considered significant.

paclitaxel effectively inhibited the migration of wildtype cells though the pores of the transwell membrane;
but the migration of HAβ3-5 was not inhibited at this
concentration (Figure 2D). At the toxic concentration
of 50 nM paclitaxel, on the other hand, the migration
of both cell lines was similarly inhibited. Thus, by two
independent assays, β3-tubulin expression was able to
counteract the inhibitory effects of 10 nM paclitaxel on
cell migration.

or negative for β3 production. For inhibition we used 10
nM paclitaxel, a concentration that is 1/5th of the IC50 for
inhibition of cell division in CHO cells [24]. The results
showed that HAβ3-containing cells (green cells, Figure
2A) were relatively insensitive to the inhibitory effects of
paclitaxel on cell migration and accumulated at the leading
edge of the wound where they made up 95% of the cells
versus only 50% of cells that migrated to the edge in the
absence of drug (Figure 2B). As a further demonstration
that β3 was the factor that mitigated the inhibitory effects
of paclitaxel on cell migration, we directly measured the
rates of migration of HAβ3-5 cells in the presence and
absence of 10 nM paclitaxel under conditions in which
HAβ3 was expressed or not expressed. The results showed
that there was a significant paclitaxel-induced decrease in
cell migration when the cells were tested in the presence
of tetracycline (no HAβ3 expression; open bars in Figure
2C), but the decrease in migration did not occur when
the cells were tested in the absence of tetracycline (with
HAβ3 expression; solid bars in Figure 2C).
β3-Tubulin’s ability to block paclitaxel inhibition of
cell movement was also tested using a transwell migration
assay in which wild-type or HAβ3-5 cells were plated
on top of the membrane in the presence or absence of
paclitaxel. After 6 h the membrane was fixed and stained
with DAPI, and the cells that migrated to the bottom of
the membrane were counted. It was observed that 10 nM

Paclitaxel inhibition of cell migration is mediated
by suppression of microtubule dynamics
We previously reported that low nontoxic
concentrations of vinblastine, colcemid, and other
microtubule disrupting drugs effectively suppressed
microtubule dynamics and inhibited cell migration [20].
To determine whether the microtubule stabilizing drug
paclitaxel also suppresses dynamics at low subtoxic
concentrations, we generated microtubule life history
plots showing time-dependent changes of microtubule
length in the presence and absence of paclitaxel (Figure
3). In the absence of drug, microtubule plus ends in wildtype CHO cells exhibited frequent episodes of growth and
shortening interspersed with periods of pause in which
there was no significant change in length (Figure 3A). The
addition of 10 nM paclitaxel (Figure 3B), a concentration
that effectively inhibited cell migration but not cell
division, caused a pronounced suppression of microtubule
plus end excursions that was similar to the suppression
caused by 50 nM drug (Figure 3C), the IC50 for inhibition
of cell division [24]. Thus, paclitaxel, like vinblastine and
colcemid, was able to suppress microtubule dynamics at
low, subtoxic concentrations.

CHO cells (WT, circles) and HAβ3-5 cells (squares) were

effects of the drug on microtubule dynamicity (solid symbols)
and cell migration (open symbols) were measured. Note the

[25], at several additional paclitaxel concentrations and
plotted the results in Figure 4. A close correlation was
found between paclitaxel suppression of dynamicity and
inhibition of cell migration for both the wild-type and
HAβ3-5 cells. Moreover, the drug concentration needed
to inhibit both processes in HAβ3-5 was approximately
10-fold higher than in the wild-type cells.

As previously reported [21], microtubules in HAβ35 cells were also dynamic in the absence of drug (Figure
3D); but unlike wild-type cells, the dynamics were not
suppressed by 10 nM paclitaxel (Figure 3E). Instead, a
much higher drug concentration (50 nM) was needed to
cause suppression (Figure 3F). Drug-induced changes in
the various parameters that describe dynamic instability
such as growth and shortening rates are summarized
in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for both of these
cell lines. The ability of drugs that promote or inhibit
microtubule assembly to decrease cell migration at the
low concentrations that suppress microtubule dynamics
supports the conclusion that dynamic microtubules are
needed for cell movement. This conclusion is further
supported by the observation that β3-tubulin prevented
the suppression of both microtubule dynamics and cell
migration that is normally caused by treatment with 10
nM paclitaxel.
To further illustrate the relationship between
microtubule dynamics and cell movement, we compared
the rate of cell migration with dynamicity, a parameter
used to characterize the extent of dynamic behavior

To determine whether paclitaxel inhibited the rate
of cell movement or simply altered the directionality of
movement into the wound, we tracked individual cells
every 15 min as they moved into a scratch wound and the
results are summarized in Figure 5. In the absence of drug,
wild-type and HAβ3-5 cells moved predominantly in the
direction of the wound with relatively few excursions
in other directions (Figure 5A). The addition of 10 nM
paclitaxel did not alter the directionality of movement,
but the progress of the wild-type cells in the direction of

Figure 5: Paclitaxel effects on cell movement. Wild-type and HAβ3-5 cells migrating into a wound in the presence and absence of
paclitaxel were tracked for 5 h by marking the X and Y positions of the nucleus relative to a fixed internal reference point at 15 min intervals
(open circles). For cases when the cell was paused (no movement) during one 15 min interval, the position is marked with a closed circle.
When there was no movement during two 15 min intervals, the position is marked with an asterisk. Note that directionality didn’t change,
but the frequency of pauses greatly increased at inhibitory concentrations of paclitaxel.

movement, and that it has quantitatively smaller effects
on the directionality or velocity of cells in motion.

the wound was clearly inhibited (Figure 5B). Some of this
inhibition was due to a smaller average distance moved
during each 15 min interval reflecting a slower velocity of
movement; but even more strikingly, there was an increased
frequency of pauses in which the cells failed to move at all
during one (solid circles) and sometimes two (asterisks)
15 min intervals. There was little further inhibition of
cell movement when the paclitaxel concentration was
increased to 50 nM (Figure 5C). Similar behavior was
observed for cell line HAβ3-5, but inhibition of migration
required the higher 50 nM drug concentration (Figure 5
D-F). The average velocities and pause frequencies for
each cell line with increasing concentrations of paclitaxel
are summarized in Figure 6. Paclitaxel caused relatively
small decreases in the velocity of cell movement (dark
bars, averaged only during the intervals the cells actually
moved), but caused larger decreases in the rate of cell
migration (light bars, calculated as ½ of the rate of wound
closure). The difference between these two calculations
could be explained by the large drug-induced increase in
pauses during which the cells did not exhibit appreciable
movement (shaded bars). These observations led us to
conclude that paclitaxel acts primarily to prevent cell

DISCUSSION
Drugs that target mitosis have proven to be very
effective agents for treating cancer. Most of these drugs
bind directly to tubulin to either inhibit or promote
microtubule assembly. The antitumor effects of these
agents are usually attributed to direct killing of the tumor
cells by activation of a mitotic checkpoint followed by
apoptosis, but there is also evidence that antimitotic drugs
are very effective inhibitors of angiogenesis and may
thereby additionally act to limit tumor growth (reviewed
in [26]). The mechanism by which microtubule targeted
drugs inhibit mitosis and angiogenesis has been thought to
involve the ability of these agents to suppress microtubule
dynamics [27]. However, we recently demonstrated that
low vinblastine and colcemid concentrations that were
insufficient to inhibit cell division were nonetheless fully
able to suppress microtubule dynamics, arguing that the
drugs do not inhibit mitosis simply by suppressing this
activity [20].	
In contrast to the absence of effects on
mitotic progression, suppression of microtubule dynamics
had clear effects on cell migration. Subtoxic drug
concentrations have previously been reported to inhibit
cell motility [28-30], and our own studies recently showed
that low, subtoxic concentrations of vinblastine, colcemid,
and other drugs that affect microtubule assembly are
able to inhibit cell migration and suppress microtubule
dynamics with similar dose-response profiles [20]. In
the studies described here, we demonstrated that the
microtubule stabilizing drug paclitaxel acts in a similar
manner.
Although there appears to be a close correlation
between the ability of microtubule targeted drugs to
suppress microtubule dynamics and their ability to
inhibit cell migration, there is as yet no direct evidence
that microtubule dynamics are required for cell motility.
Previous studies, however, indicated that incorporation
of β3-tubulin into microtubules reduced the effect of
paclitaxel on dynamic instability [21]. If cell migration
requires that microtubules be dynamic, we reasoned that β3
expression should also cause cell migration to be relatively
“resistant” to the effects of the drug. The results described
here confirmed that hypothesis; the dose responses for
paclitaxel suppression of microtubule dynamics and
inhibition of cell migration were both similarly shifted
to approximately 10-fold higher drug concentrations
when β3-tubulin was present. This outcome provides the
strongest evidence to date that dynamic microtubules are
required for cell motility.
The mechanism by which microtubule dynamics
affect cell migration is unclear. Cells initiate motility
by extending a lamellipodium at their leading edge in
an actin-dependent manner, thereby causing them to

Microtubule tracks similar to those in Figure 5 were used to
measure cell velocity (using only intervals during which the
cells actually moved, solid bars), cell migration (1/2 the rate at
which the wound closed, open bars), and frequency of pauses

stretch in the direction of movement [18]. The trailing
edge must then release from the substratum and snap
forward in order for the cell to translocate, and there is
evidence to suggest that microtubules control this latter
process [31]. In agreement, we recently reported that
suppressing microtubule dynamics with vinblastine did
not stop migrating cells from extending a lamellipodium
but rather appeared to inhibit the ability of the tail to
retract [20]. These observations are consistent with the
discovery that microtubules are stabilized at the leading
edge of migrating cells but remain dynamic at the trailing
edge [32]. Microtubule involvement in tail retraction
could be mediated by effects on adhesion site turnover,
or by effects on the actin cytoskeleton, but exactly how
microtubules are involved remains an unsettled question
[19]. Our data demonstrate that microtubule dynamics are
critical for their ability to influence cell movement.
Our results also have important clinical implications.
A number of studies have noted that tumors from diverse
tissues inappropriately express β3-tubulin, an isoform
that is normally restricted to brain and Sertoli cells [1, 2].
Moreover, β3 is usually seen in tumors that are especially
difficult to treat and it frequently is found in tumors from
patients who have relapsed [16, 17, 33]. Again, however,
these observations represent correlations and there is
little evidence to suggest that β3 plays a direct role in
the response to treatment. It is likely that during their
growth tumor cells have accumulated many mutations
and other changes that could affect their behavior. Thus,
the appearance of a protein such as β3 might, or might
not, have functional consequences. In this regard, it was
recently shown that β3 is induced in tumors that have
become hypoxic and/or starved for glucose [34, 35].
As such, it might be only one of a series of genes that
have been activated due to the conditions under which
the tumor cells are growing, and could be a marker for
aggressiveness rather than a driver of the behavior.
Arguing in favor of a direct role of β3 in tumor
cell behavior, a number of studies have reported that
cells selected for resistance to the cytotoxic effects of
paclitaxel have increased expression of β3, suggesting
that this isotype can confer resistance to the drug [13,
14]. Subsequent studies in our laboratory confirmed this
idea but demonstrated that increased β3 expression alone
can only confer very weak 1.5-fold resistance and that it
acts by altering the extent of microtubule assembly [15].
In contrast to the weak effects on the cytotoxic action
of the drug, we show here that β3 expression produces
a 10-fold resistance to the ability of paclitaxel to inhibit
cell migration. Because cell migration is a critical step in
angiogenesis and tumor cell metastasis, our data suggest
that β3’s effects on motility are a better explanation for
the observation that its expression correlates with poor
prognosis.

Cell lines
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown at
37 °C and 5% CO2 in α-MEM supplemented with 5%
fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml
streptomycin. HAβ3-5, a CHO cell line that expresses HAtagged β3-tubulin under the control of a tetracycline (tet)
regulated promoter [15], was maintained in the presence
of tet; β3-tubulin expression was induced by growing the
cells overnight in medium without tet. Human cancer cell
lines including HeLa, DU145, MCF7, K562, and KB3
were grown in α-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Immunofluorescence
Cells on sterile glass coverslips were fixed in
methanol at –20 °C, or in some cases, they were preextracted before fixation by incubating the coverslips for
1 min at 4 °C in microtubule stabilizing buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5%
NP40) containing 4 µM paclitaxel. Following fixation, the
cells were rehydrated in PBS and incubated with a 1:100
dilutions of mouse monoclonal antibody TUJ1 (Covance,
Princeton, NJ) (to detect β3-tubulin) and rabbit polyclonal
antibody X2 (gift of Dr. Chloe Bulinski, Columbia
University) (to detect α-tubulin) for 2 h at 37 °C. The HA
tagged β3-tubulin overexpressing CHO cells were stained
with similar dilutions of rabbit polyclonal HA antibody
(Bethyl Labs, Montgomery, TX) and DM1A (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO), a monoclonal antibody to detect
α-tubulin. After washing, the cells were further stained for
1 h with a 1:100 dilutions of Alexa 488-conjugated goat
anti mouse IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti rabbit
IgG (Invitrogen) that included 1 µg/ml 4’,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) to stain DNA. Cells were viewed
using an Optiphot microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY)
equipped with a MagnaFire digital camera (Optronics,
Goleta, CA).

Electrophoresis and western blots
Cellular proteins were solubilized in SDS sample
buffer, separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide minigels, and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes
were incubated with 1:2,000 dilutions of TUJ1 and actin
antibody C4 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) followed by
Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen).
Bands were detected by fluorescence emission using a
Storm 860 scanner (GE Healthcare).

change in length of a microtubule between two successive
time points was greater than 0.5 µm, it was considered
real growth or shortening; otherwise, it was treated as
noise. Catastrophe was defined as the transition from
either growth or pause to shortening, and the catastrophe
frequency was calculated as the number of transitions
divided by the time spent in growth and pause. Rescue
was defined as the transition from shortening to either
growth or pause, and the rescue frequency was calculated
as the number of such events divided by the time spent
shortening. Dynamicity, an overall measure for how
dynamic the microtubules behave, was calculated by
dividing the total change in length (including both growth
and shortening) of a microtubule by the total time the
microtubule was under observation. Each parameter was
calculated from microtubules persisting for more than 2
min and is expressed as the mean ± standard error. The
student t-test was used to compare parameters between
different cell lines and treatments. Differences were
considered significant when the p value was less than 0.05.

Cells were grown in a monolayer to about 85%
of confluence. A scratch was made at the center of the
petridish using a wooden toothpick, and fresh medium
was added with or without paclitaxel. Wound closure was
monitored using an inverted microscope and 4X phase
objective. The wound was photographed every 15 minutes
for 8 h and the rate of wound closure was measured from
the slope of the gap size plotted against time. This value
was divided by 2 to arrive at the rate of cell migration at
each edge of the wound.

Transwell assay
Approximately 5000 cells were seeded into the
upper chamber of 24-well cell culture inserts containing
8 µm membrane pores (BD Biosciences) and allowed to
settle for 2 h in αMEM containing 10% FBS. Medium
was then removed and replaced with fresh medium
containing varying concentrations of paclitaxel. The
dishes were incubated a further 6 h to allow cell migration,
and residual cells in the upper chamber were removed
with a cotton swab. The membranes were then excised,
fixed in methanol, and stained with DAPI. The nuclei
on the bottom membrane surface were counted from 20
microscopic fields chosen at random using a fluorescence
microscope and 20X objective. A minimum of 300 cells
were counted for each data point and the experiment was
repeated twice.

Cells were seeded onto sterile 25 mm circular
coverslips and transfected with EGFP-MAP4 (provided
by Dr. Joanna Olmsted, University of Rochester) using
Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After transfection the
cells were maintained in the presence or absence of
paclitaxel for 2 d and then transferred to McCoy’s 5A
medium containing 25 mM HEPES (Mediatech) with
the appropriate concentration of paclitaxel. Images were
captured 5 s apart at 37 °C using a DeltaVision Core
imaging system (Applied Precision Inc., Issaquah, WA)
equipped with a CCD camera and imaging software
supplied by the vendor.

The contour distance between the plus-end of a
microtubule and an arbitrary reference point on the same
microtubule was measured using ImageJ software and
graphed as a function of time to generate life history
plots. The rates of growth and shortening were calculated
from the slopes of the plots using linear regression. If the
