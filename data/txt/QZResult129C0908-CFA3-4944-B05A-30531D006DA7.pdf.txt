ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly deadly malignancy.
Expression of the stem cell transcription factor SOX2 increases during progression
of PDAC. Knockdown of SOX2 in PDAC cell lines decreases growth in vitro; whereas,
stable overexpression of SOX2 in one PDAC cell line reportedly increases growth in
vitro. Here, we reexamined the role of SOX2 in PDAC cells, because inducible SOX2
overexpression in other tumor cell types inhibits growth. In this study, four PDAC cell
lines were engineered for inducible overexpression of SOX2 or inducible knockdown of
SOX2. Remarkably, inducible overexpression of SOX2 in PDAC cells inhibits growth in
vitro and reduces tumorigenicity. Additionally, inducible knockdown of SOX2 in PDAC
cells reduces growth in vitro and in vivo. Thus, growth and tumorigenicity of PDAC
cells is highly dependent on the expression of optimal levels of SOX2 – a hallmark
of molecular rheostats. We also determined that SOX2 alters the responses of PDAC
cells to drugs used in PDAC clinical trials. Increasing SOX2 reduces growth inhibition
mediated by MEK and AKT inhibitors; whereas knockdown of SOX2 further reduces
growth when PDAC cells are treated with these inhibitors. Thus, targeting SOX2, or
its mode of action, could improve the treatment of PDAC.

desperate need to identify new therapeutic targets that
influence drug-resistance. Thus far, a wide range of genes
and signaling pathways have been shown to be aberrantly
activated in PDAC. The most common mutation is in
the coding region of the KRAS gene, which generates
constitutively activated KRAS in >90% of all PDAC [3].
These tumors are highly dependent on upregulated AKT
and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, which are downstream of
KRAS [4–7]. This led to a large number of PDAC clinical
trials testing AKT inhibitors (AKTi), e.g. MK-2206, and
at least five MEK inhibitors (MEKi), e.g. trametinib [8].
Disappointingly, these drugs have not produced significant
responses in PDAC clinical trials, which has led to the
general belief that PDAC is largely resistant to AKTi and
MEKi.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one
of the most lethal malignancies. For several decades, the
5-year survival of patients with PDAC has remained at or
below 7% with a median survival of less than one year for
patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease [1].
In the United States, PDAC is the fourth most common
cause of cancer deaths (~40,000/year), and it is predicted
to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the
United States by 2030 [2]. The high mortality of PDAC
patients is due in large measure to late diagnosis of the
disease when tumor resection is not feasible and resistance
of PDAC to chemotherapy designed to target aberrantly
regulated signaling networks. Consequently, there is a

Recent studies in many cancers have concluded
that the stem cell transcription factor SOX2 is likely to
contribute to drug resistance [9–16]. SOX2 belongs to the
highly conserved HMG box family of SOX transcription
factors. Early studies demonstrated that SOX2 plays
essential roles during embryogenesis, and it functions as a
master regulator in pluripotent embryonic stem cells [17].
Moreover, the levels of SOX2 must be carefully regulated
within narrow limits in pluripotent stem cells. Not only
does a reduction in SOX2 disrupt the self-renewal of
embryonic stem cells [18], an increase of SOX2 as small
as two-fold is sufficient to block their self-renewal and
trigger their differentiation [19]. Consistent with these
findings, small differences in SOX2 levels also alter the
efficiency of reprogramming of somatic cells into induced
pluripotent stem cells [20]. Together, these studies indicate
that SOX2 functions as a molecular rheostat to control
crucial activities of pluripotent stem cells [21].
SOX2 is not only essential for normal stem cell
function, it has also been implicated in over 20 different
cancers, including cancers of the brain, breast, ovary, lung,
skin, prostate and pancreas [9–16, 22–33]. SOX2 has also
been implicated in the tumor-initiating cell population (the
proposed cancer stem cell population) of most of these
cancers [9–16, 23–36]. With some notable exceptions
[34–36], support for important roles of SOX2 in these
cancers has been primarily generated from the study of
tumor cell lines engineered for stable overexpression
of SOX2. Stable overexpression of SOX2 in cell lines
derived from many types of cancer has been reported to
increase tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo [31, 37–42].
However, different results are obtained when tumor cells
are engineered for inducible overexpression of SOX2.
Stable overexpression of SOX2 in the prostate tumor cell
line DU145 has been reported to increase cell growth both
in vitro and in vivo[37]; whereas, inducible overexpression
of SOX2 (3- to 5-fold) in DU145 cells inhibits tumor cell
growth [43]. Similar results have been reported for breast
tumor cell lines [43].
SOX2 expression increases significantly during
tumor progression rising from ~ 20% in pre-malignant
PanIN3 lesions to nearly 60% of poorly differentiated
PDAC [22]. Subsequent studies reported that SOX2
is expressed in many different human PDAC cell lines,
with high expression in some PDAC cell lines, but little
or no expression in others [23]. Importantly, this study
demonstrated that SOX2 expression is closely associated
with putative cancer stem cell markers previously
reported to be expressed by PDAC tumor-initiating cells
[23]. This study also demonstrated that knocking down
SOX2 in PDAC cell lines reduced their growth in vitro;
whereas, stable expression of SOX2 in a PDAC cell line,
which does not endogenously express detectable levels
of SOX2, increased their anchorage-independent growth
[23]. Although this study provided support in vitro for a
critical role of SOX2 in the stemness of PDAC, the effects
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of SOX2 on the tumorigenicity of PDAC tumor cells were
not examined.
Here, we examined the growth responses of
multiple PDAC cells lines engineered for either inducible
overexpression of SOX2 or inducible knockdown of
SOX2. In addition to examining how altering SOX2
expression influences PDAC cell growth in vitro, we
examined how tumorigenicity is affected when SOX2
levels are increased and decreased. Given the association
reported for SOX2 in drug-resistance in several other
cancers, we also examined how changes in the levels of
SOX2 influence the responses of PDAC cells to MEKi and
AKTi used in clinical trials.

RESULTS
To determine how elevating the levels of SOX2
influences the behavior of PDAC cells, we engineered
T3M4 PDAC cells for inducible overexpression of
epitope-tagged SOX2. Epitope-tagged SOX2 enabled
us to distinguish exogenously expressed SOX2 from
endogenous SOX2. SOX2 was tagged at its N-terminus
with a sequence that codes for a Flag-Strep tag. Previous
studies have shown that placement of this tag at the
N-terminus does not interfere with its function [43–47].
T3M4 cells were selected because they express SOX2
at intermediate levels, ~15-fold lower than L3.6 cells
(data not shown), which have been shown previously to
express SOX2 at levels significantly higher than most
other PDAC cell lines [23]. Additionally, L3.6 cells
express mutant KRAS (G12D);[48] whereas, T3M4
cells heterozygously express a different KRAS mutant
(Q61H/WT) [49]. Using T3M4 cells, we could determine
how both inducible overexpression of SOX2, as well as
inducible knockdown of SOX2 (see below), influences
the behavior of PDAC cells. T3M4 cells were engineered
for inducible overexpression with the aid of two lentiviral
vectors, which are similar to those used previously to
engineer brain tumor cells for inducible expression of
exogenous SOX2 [43]. One lentiviral vector codes for
the expression of the reverse tet-transactivator driven by
a PGK promoter, and the second lentiviral vector codes
for the expression of epitope-tagged SOX2, which is
driven by a doxycycline (Dox) inducible promoter (Figure
1A). After viral transduction of T3M4 cells, cells stably
transduced with both lentiviral vectors were isolated as
described in the Materials and Methods. These cells are
referred to as i-SOX2-T3M4 cells.

Overexpression of SOX2 reduces PDAC cell
growth in vitro and in vivo
To determine how inducible elevation of SOX2
influences the in vitro growth of i-SOX2-T3M4 cells,
we initially examined a Dox-dose response curve. As the
concentration of Dox was increased, there was a dose

dependent increase in the expression of Flag-SOX2. At
300 ng/ml of Dox there was ~7.5-fold increase in total
SOX2 (endogenous plus exogenous SOX2) (Figure
1B). Treatment of i-SOX2-T3M4 cells with Dox over
a 4 day period led to decreased cell growth at all Dox
concentrations tested, reaching nearly 40% reduction

in cell proliferation at 300 ng/ml of Dox (Figure 1C). A
significant reduction in cell growth was evident after 72
hr (not statistically different at 48 hr, Figure 1D). As a
control, we tested the effects of Dox on parental T3M4
cells. At concentrations as high as 1 μg/ml, there were
no effects on the growth of parental T3M4 cells (Figure

in the presence or absence of Dox (300 ng/ml) as described in the Materials and Methods section. Representative photomicrographs (25X)
were taken on day 8 and the cells in both panels were photographed at the same magnification. F. Soft agar growth in serum-free, stem cell

significance was determined by student’s t-test (*p<0.05, **p <0.01, ***p<0.005). The studies shown in B, D, E, and F were repeated and
similar results were obtained.

cells were engrafted subcutaneously into NCr-nu/nu
mice, as described in the Materials and Methods. Nine
days after palpable tumors had formed, sized-matched
tumors were randomly assigned to the control or the
Dox-treated group. After 9 additional days, tumors in
the control group (11 mice) had grown to an average >
450 mm3; whereas tumors in the Dox-treated group (11
mice) exhibited much less growth, reaching on average
~90 mm3 (~80% smaller, p<0.001) (Figure 2). In addition,
tumor weight was reduced ~70% in the Dox-treated group
(Supplementary Figure 2). There was also ~2-fold increase
in fraction of the tumor consisting of desmoplastic stroma
relative to that observed in the control tumor group, which
were not treated with Dox, as determined by smooth
muscle actin staining (SMA) (p<0.05, Supplementary
Figure 2). Interestingly, the proliferation marker Ki67 was ~75% lower in the tumor cell compartment of
the Dox-treated tumors compared to untreated tumors
(p<0.01); whereas, Ki-67 staining was ~2-fold higher
in the stromal compartments of Dox-treated tumors
compared to untreated tumors (p<0.05, Supplementary
Figure 2). Altogether, our findings argue that inducible
overexpression of SOX2 in PDAC cells does not increase
cell growth, but, in fact, reduces their growth in culture as
well as their tumorigenicity.

1C). To extend these studies, we assessed the effects of
elevating SOX2 on the clonal growth of i-SOX2-T3M4
cells in both monolayer culture and under anchorageindependent growth conditions. When plated at clonal
densities in monolayer culture, inducible overexpression
of SOX2 after 8 days significantly reduced the number
of colonies, as well as the size of the colonies (Figure
1E). Importantly, even after repeated passage in the
presence of Dox (> 10 passages), we failed to observe
the emergence of cells that exhibited accelerated growth
due to elevation of SOX2. After each passage, there was
a reduction in the growth of cells treated with Dox when
compared to cells cultured in the absence of Dox (data
not shown). Not surprisingly, inducible elevation of SOX2
also failed to increase the growth of i-SOX2-T3M4 cells
under anchorage-independent growth conditions. After
treatment with Dox for 9 days in serum-free, stem cell
medium, the number and size of the colonies formed in
soft-agar was reduced significantly (Figure 1F). Under
these conditions, there was a reduction in the total number
of colonies, where the largest reduction was in the number
of large colonies.
To determine whether the effects of SOX2
overexpression were PDAC cell line dependent, we
engineered two additional PDAC cell lines, BxPC3
and HPAF-II, for inducible overexpression of SOX2.
BxPC3 cells endogenously express SOX2 at levels ~5fold higher than T3M4 cells; whereas, HPAF-II cells
express endogenous SOX2 at levels lower than T3M4
cells (data not shown). HPAF-II cells express activated,
mutant KRAS (G12D);[50] whereas, BxPC3 cells express
wild-type KRAS [51, 52]. Thus, BxPC3 cells could help
determine whether the effects of inducible overexpression
of SOX2 were related to the KRAS status of PDAC cells.
BxPC3 cells and HPAF-II cells were each transduced
with the same lentiviral vector set (Figure 1A) used to
engineer T3M4 cells. As shown for i-SOX2-T3M4, we
observed tunable induction of exogenous SOX2 when
i-SOX2-HPAF-II cells and i-SOX2-BxPC3 were exposed
to increasing concentrations of Dox (Supplementary
Figure 1). In addition, at all Dox concentrations tested,
elevation of SOX2 in i-SOX2-HPAF-II and i-SOX2BxPC3 cells reduced both their short-term monolayer
growth and their growth at clonal density (Supplementary
Figure 1). Elevating SOX2 in i-SOX2-HPAF-II, led to
~40% reduction in growth. In the case of i-SOX2-BxPC3
cells, reduction in growth was smaller, but statistically
significant. Importantly, under no conditions examined
did we observe an increase in proliferation when SOX2
levels were elevated in three different PDAC cell lines.
Altogether our studies demonstrate that inducible
overexpression of SOX2 in PDAC cells reduces their
growth in vitro.
A key property of cancer cells is tumorigenicity.

Knockdown of SOX2 decreases PDAC cell
growth in vitro and in vivo
We also assessed the impact of knocking down
SOX2 on the growth and tumorigenicity of T3M4 cells.
For this purpose, T3M4 cells were transduced with a single
lentiviral vector that codes for an inducible promoter
driving expression of a SOX2 shRNA, as well as coding
for constitutive expression of the reverse tet-transactivator
that is capable of binding to the Dox-inducible promoter
when Dox is added to the culture medium. Productively
transduced T3M4 cells, referred to as i-KdSOX2T3M4 cells, were isolated as described in the Materials
and Methods. Treatment of these cells with increasing
concentrations of Dox led to dose dependent reductions
in the expression of endogenous SOX2 protein (Figure
3A) and dose dependent reductions in cell growth (Figure
3B). After 3 days of growth, there was a statistically
significant reduction of growth, reaching >50% inhibition
after 4 days (Figure 3C) when SOX2 was reduced ~60%
(Figure 3A). As discussed below, treatment with Dox at
this concentration also reduced the number of colonies as
well as the size of colonies when plated at clonal density
in monolayer culture. Additionally, a second, independent
shRNA lentiviral vector was used in T3M4 cells to validate
that observed effects were due to the knockdown of SOX2.
As described above, increasing the concentration of Dox
resulted in dose-dependent reductions in SOX2 protein
expression and in cell growth after 4 days when using
this second shRNA vector; however, this shRNA was less

effective at knocking down SOX2 (~40% reduction) and
less effective at reducing growth (<30%, Supplementary
Figure 3). Thus, in the studies described below, the cells
engineered with the first SOX2 shRNA were used.
Additionally, we examined whether knocking down
SOX2 in another PDAC cell line would also alter their
growth. For this purpose, L3.6 cells, which express high
levels of SOX2, were transduced with the same Doxinducible SOX2 shRNA lentiviral vector used to generate
i-KdSOX2-T3M4 cells. Treatment of i-KdSOX2-L3.6
cells with increasing concentrations of Dox led to a dose
dependent decrease in the expression of SOX2 protein and
a decrease in the growth of the cells in monolayer culture
(Figure 3D–3F).
Next, we assessed the impact of knocking down
SOX2 on the tumorigenicity of i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cells.
i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cells were engrafted subcutaneously
into NCr-nu/nu mice. Once palpable tumors had formed
by engrafted i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cells, mice with sizedmatched tumors were randomly assigned to the control
or the Dox-treated group. After an additional 8 days, the
tumors in the control group increased from an average

of 20 mm3 to an average of 230 mm3; whereas tumors in
the Dox group increased from an average of 20 mm3 to
an average of 70 mm3 – a reduction of ~70% (Figure 4).
Immunohistochemical staining for the proliferation marker
Ki-67 was reduced ~50% in the tumor cell compartment
of the Dox-treated tumors compared to untreated tumors
(p<0.05, Supplementary Figure 4). Altogether, our studies
demonstrate that either increasing SOX2 (Figure 2) or
decreasing SOX2 reduces the growth of tumors. Thus, the
tumorigenicity of these cells is highly dependent on the
expression of optimal levels of SOX2.

Inducible modulation of SOX2 levels alters the
efficacy of drugs used clinically
Another critical property of tumor cells is their
response to drugs, in particular drugs designed to target
major signaling nodes activated in specific tumor types.
Therefore, we tested the impact of altering the levels of
SOX2 on the growth responses of PDAC cells to drugs
used in PDAC clinical trials. Initially, we examined how
elevating SOX2 influences the cell cycle of i-SOX2-

T3M4 cells when treated with five MEKi that have been,
or that are currently, used in PDAC clinical trials. For this
purpose, we initially determined the EC50 for each MEKi
exhibited by i-SOX2-T3M4 cells based on the reduction
in growth over a 4 day period (Supplementary Table 1).
Additionally, we confirmed the suppression of ERK1/2
phosphorylation when MEKi are used at their EC50
(Supplementary Figure 5). When used at their respective
EC50, each of the MEKi led to a sizable increase in the G1
population of the cells and a sizable decrease in S-phase
after 48 hr (Figure 5). As expected, elevating SOX2 by
treatment with Dox also altered the cell cycle of i-SOX2T3M4. However, there was only a modest increase in
G1 and a modest decrease S-phase. Remarkably, when
the cells were treated simultaneously with Dox and any
of the five MEKi, we observed a partial reversal of the
cell cycle changes observed with each MEKi on its own.
More specifically, the increase in G1 and the reduction of
S-phase observed with the MEKi was partially reduced
when SOX2 levels were elevated in the cells (Figure 5A).

Interestingly, each of the five MEKi induced pronounced
morphological changes exemplified by significant cell
spreading and this effect was also partially reversed when
SOX2 was inducibly elevated (Figure 5B).
To more carefully assess the effects of elevating
SOX2 on the growth responses of PDAC cells when
treated with MEKi, we examined the clonal growth of
i-SOX2-T3M4 cells cultured in the presence of one of the
MEKi (trametinib) with and without Dox. For this purpose,
24 hr after the cells had been subcultured, trametinib and/
or Dox were added to the cells where indicated. During the
following 8 days, the cells were refed with fresh medium
containing trametinib and/or Dox every other day. After
8 days of treatment, the number of colonies formed
when the cells were treated with trametinib at its EC50
was significantly reduced. However, treatment with both
trametinib and Dox led to a much smaller reduction in
colony number (Figure 6A). As a control, we determined
that treatment of parental T3M4 cells with Dox did not

analysis of SOX2 was performed using whole cell extracts from i-KdSOX2-T3M4 cells following 3 days of Dox-induction of the shRNA

growth of i-KdSOX2-T3M4 was examined by MTT assay following 4 days growth at the indicated Dox doses. Growth in the absence of
Dox was set to 1. C. Proliferation of i-KdSOX2-T3M4 cells in the presence or absence of Dox (1 μg/ml) over a 4 day period was determined
by MTT assays. These studies were repeated and similar results were obtained. D. Western blot analysis of SOX2 was performed using
whole cell extracts from i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cells following 2 days of Dox-induction of the shRNA targeting SOX2. The knockdown of SOX2
was compared to SOX2 levels in the untreated sample. HDAC1 protein was used as a loading control. E. Proliferation of i-KdSOX2-L3.6
was examined by MTT assay following 4 days growth at the indicated Dox concentrations. F. Growth of i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cells over 4 days
was determined by MTT assay following growth in the presence or absence of Dox (500 ng/ml). Error bars represent standard deviation and
p values were determined by student’s t-test (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, and ***p<0.005). The studies in shown in A, C, D, and F were repeated
and similar results were obtained.

affect the dose response curves of trametinib or a second
MEKi, selumetinib (data not shown).
To further evaluate the effects of trametinib on
i-SOX2-T3M4 cells, the cells were cultured for 6 days
at typical cell culture densities (1.2x104/cm2) in the
presence of trametinib with or without Dox. After 6 days,
cells treated with trametinib or trametinib plus Dox both
exhibited a change in morphology (Figure 6B) relative to
untreated i-SOX2-T3M4 cells (Figure 1E), but the cells
treated with trametinib on its own exhibited the most
pronounced morphological change. Next, the trametinib
treated and the trametinib plus Dox treated cells were
subcultured and replated at clonal densities in the absence
of trametinib and Dox. Although the trametinib treated
cells and the trametinib plus Dox treated cells were
replated at equal cell numbers, the cloning efficiency of the
trametinib plus Dox treated cells was substantially higher
than those treated with trametinib on its own (Figure
6C). As a control, we determined that pre-treatment with
Dox on its own does not improve the cloning efficiency

of i-SOX2-T3M4 cells when replated. In fact, treatment
with Dox on its own for 6 days prior to replating in
medium lacking Dox reduces cloning efficiency ~50%
(data not shown). Interestingly, the morphology of the
few colonies formed from the trametinib treated cells
continued to exhibit a flattened morphology; whereas the
colonies formed from the trametinib plus Dox treated cells
exhibited morphology much closer to that of untreated
i-SOX2-T3M4 cells. In addition, we observed a similar
differential in the number of colonies formed when
the trametinib, and trametinib plus Dox treated cells
were replated and grown under anchorage-independent
conditions in serum-free, stem cell medium (Figure 6D).
Thus, even though elevating SOX2 on its own inhibits
the proliferation of i-SOX2-T3M4 cells, elevating SOX2
in these cells reduces the growth inhibitory effects of
trametinib under more than one condition.
To determine whether the protective effects of
elevating SOX2 were cell line dependent, we examined
how elevation of SOX2 influenced the clonal growth of

i-SOX2-BxPC3 cells and i-SOX2-HPAF-II cells. As in
the case of i-SOX2-T3M4 cells, inducible elevation of
SOX2 also reduced the inhibitory effects of trametinib on
the clonal growth of i-SOX2-BxPC3 cells and i-SOX2HPAF-II cells (Supplementary Figure 6). For these studies,
trametinib was used at the EC50 for i-SOX2-BxPC3 cells
and i-SOX2-HPAF-II cells (Supplementary Table 1).
Thus, the protection afforded by elevating SOX2 was not
limited to i-SOX2-T3M4 cells. Equally important, the
protective effect of SOX2 was not limited to trametinib.
Inducible overexpression of SOX2 in i-SOX2-T3M4,
i-SOX2-BxPC3, and i-SOX2-HPAF-II cells also reduced
the inhibitory effects of the AKTi, MK-2206 (Figure 6A,
Supplementary Figure 7). Again, MK-2206 was used at
the EC50 for each PDAC cell line (Supplementary Table
1). Altogether, our studies show that although inducible

elevation of SOX2 on its own reduces the clonal growth of
three different PDAC cell lines, elevating SOX2 in these
cells partially reverses the growth inhibitory effects of
trametinib and MK-2206.
Finally, we examined whether knocking down
SOX2 in PDAC cells would lead to further reduction
in growth when the cells were treated with trametinib
or MK-2206. Initially, we addressed this question using
i-KdSOX2-T3M4 cells. As in the case of i-SOX2-T3M4
cells, treatment of i-KdSOX2-T3M4 cells with trametinib
or MK-2206 each reduced the number and the sizes of
the colonies that formed when the cells were plated at
clonal densities (Figure 7A). Importantly, knocking down
SOX2 in conjunction with trametinib or MK-2206 led to
a further reduction in the number of colonies that formed.
Like i-KdSOX2-T3M4 cells, growth of i-KdSOX2-L3.6

cells at clonal densities was reduced by trametinib and
MK-2206 (Figure 7B). Moreover, growth of these cells
was reduced even further when SOX2 was knocked
down and the cells were treated with drug. Thus, these
findings, in conjunction with the SOX2 overexpression
studies described earlier, strongly support the conclusion
that SOX2 helps protect PDAC cells from the growth
inhibitory effects of MEKi and AKTi.

targeting SOX2 or its mode of action could improve the
effectiveness of these drugs against PDAC.
Prior to the work described here, stable
overexpression of SOX2 in a PDAC cell line had
been shown to increase cell proliferation in vitro. We
reexamined the role of SOX2 in PDAC, because we had
previously determined that inducible elevation of SOX2
in various types of tumor cells leads to growth inhibition
rather than growth promotion [43]. Importantly, the work
described here demonstrates that this is also true for
PDAC cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that inducible
elevation of SOX2 in three different PDAC cell lines
in vitro leads to growth inhibition, rather than growth
stimulation. We also determined that increases in SOX2
lead to a reduction in tumorigenicity. Under no conditions
was growth observed to increase when SOX2 levels were
elevated from an inducible promoter.
There may be several possible reasons why
inducible overexpression leads to growth inhibition of
PDAC cells, whereas stable overexpression of SOX2
can lead to increased cell proliferation. However, the
most likely explanation lies in the methods used to
derive the genetically engineered cells. Cells engineered
for inducible overexpression were established via drug
selection of virally transduced cells, which occurs at
high frequency (>70%), prior to any alterations in the
overexpression of SOX2. In contrast, cells engineered for

DISCUSSION
Recent work has shown that SOX2 is not only
expressed in ~20 different types of human cancer [9–16,
22–33], it also appears to influence drug resistance in at
least six of these cancers. [9–16] SOX2 had been shown
to be expressed in PDAC [22, 23], but its roles in tumor
growth and drug resistance had not been examined prior
to work described here. In this study, we demonstrate that
either increasing or decreasing levels of SOX2 in PDAC
cells reduces growth both in vitro and in vivo. Equally
important, we demonstrate that elevating the levels of
SOX2 reduces the efficacy of several MEKi, including
trametinib, and the AKTi MK-2206, which have thus far
yielded disappointing patient responses in PDAC clinical
trials. Our studies indicate that the effects of SOX2 on the
responses to trametinib and MK-2206 are not dependent
on the mutation status of KRAS. As discussed below,

stable overexpression of SOX2 undergo drug selection in
the presence of elevated levels of SOX2. Consequently,
cells that grow slowly in the presence of elevated SOX2,
as we have shown is the case for three different PDAC
cell lines, will be lost during the period of drug selection
as the faster growing cell population expands. Inevitably,
cells that survive drug selection in the presence of elevated
SOX2 will represent a subpopulation of the parental
PDAC cell population. Importantly, our studies argue
that this subpopulation is likely to represent a very small
minority of PDAC cells. This is especially clear in the case
of i-SOX2-T3M4 cells. Continual growth of these cells in
the presence of Dox for >10 passages failed to lead to the
emergence of cells that grow faster due to the elevation
of SOX2.
Although inducible elevation of SOX2 leads to
PDAC growth inhibition in vitro as well as a substantial
reduction in tumor growth, this does not indicate that
SOX2 plays little or no role in promoting the growth of
PDAC. Previous studies had shown that knockdown of
SOX2 in four different PDAC cells lines reduces growth
in vitro [23]. In the work presented in our study, we not
only demonstrate that knockdown of SOX2 reduces
growth in vitro, we also demonstrate that tumor growth
of i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cells is reduced when SOX2 is
knocked down in vivo. Thus, SOX2 is clearly required for
the growth of PDAC both in vitro and in vivo. Equally
important, our studies indicate that endogenous levels of
SOX2 in PDAC cells are optimized for maximum growth,
as both increases and decreases in SOX2 reduce PDAC
cell growth. Hence, SOX2 functions as a molecular
rheostat in the control of PDAC cell proliferation. Coupled
with our demonstration that this is also true for ES cells
[19] and four other tumor cell types [43], we suggest that
this is a defining feature of SOX2.
The finding that SOX2 levels need to be maintained
at optimal levels was first described in ES cells. In these
cells, knockdown of SOX2 or a 2-fold increase in SOX2
disrupts the self-renewal of ES cells and triggers their
differentiation [19, 45]. The need to maintain SOX2
levels within narrow limits is not surprising when one
examines the SOX2-interactome in different cell types.
Proteomic analysis of the SOX2-interactome in ES cells,
as well as medulloblastoma cells and glioblastoma cells,
indicates that SOX2 associates in high molecular weight
protein complexes with a large and diverse set of nuclear
proteins [46, 47, 53]. In ES cells, SOX2 is part of a highly
integrated transcription circuitry that involves multiple
master regulators known to control the self-renewal and
pluripotency of ESC [17, 46]. Moreover, SOX2 and the
other master regulators that it associates with in ES cells
each form complexes with many of the same proteins. As
a result, a small increase in the level of SOX2 is likely to
lead to the formation of incomplete protein complexes that
are essential for ES cells. Moreover, the potent biological

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

impact of small changes in SOX2 levels seems all the more
likely because SOX2 forms complexes with a wide variety
of proteins involved in many critical cellular processes.
In addition to transcription, SOX2 forms complexes with
proteins involved in signal transduction and DNA repair
[46, 47, 53]. Not surprisingly, knockdown of the RNA
binding protein Musashi 2 or the deubiquitinating enzyme
USP9X, which have been shown to associate with SOX2
in multiple cell types, disrupts the self-renewal of ES cells
and inhibits the growth of brain tumor cells [47].
Although SOX2 levels must be maintained at
optimal levels in PDAC cells, increases in the levels of
SOX2 undoubtedly occur during oncogenesis. In this
regard, the SOX2 gene is amplified in several cancers,
[41, 54–56] and high levels of SOX2 correlate with
poor prognosis in many cancers [24, 57–60]. As shown
previously, SOX2 protein levels vary considerably
between different PDAC cell lines [23]. In the case of
T3M4 and L3.6 PDAC cells, SOX2 expression differs
by ~15-fold. Thus, PDAC cells do not exhibit a single
optimum for SOX2 expression. This raises a fundamental
question. If SOX2 levels must be maintained within
optimal limits to promote tumor growth, how can SOX2
levels rise during tumor progression? We suggest that
increases in the levels of SOX2 must be accompanied by
corresponding changes in other genes required for growth
promotion by SOX2 and/or downregulation of genes
that interfere with the action of SOX2 when its levels
rise during tumor progression. Changing SOX2 levels
in isolation disrupts cell function. SOX2 is by no means
unique in this regard. For example, MAP3K7 and CHD1
have been shown to be co-deleted in prostate cancer and
their co-deletion in ETS rearrangement-negative prostate
cancers correlates with poor patient disease-free survival
[61]. In a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer,
knockdown of MAK3K7 on its own had no significant
effect on survival and knockdown of CHD1 on its own
enhanced survival. However, combined knockdown of
MAK3K7 and CHD1 led to larger tumor volumes and
shorter survival [61]. Accordingly, we posit that the
identification and targeting of genes that must change in
concert with increases in SOX2 could provide a novel
strategy for blocking, or at least, reducing the growth of
tumors dependent on SOX2.
Currently, it is unknown how SOX2 reduces the
effectiveness of MEKi and AKTi in PDAC cells. However,
progress has been made in understanding how SOX2 is
regulated in PDAC as well has how SOX2 influences
the growth of PDAC cells. A recent study points to an
interesting connection between SOX2 and NFATc1.
Knockdown of NFATc1, which is often overexpressed in
PDAC, leads to a decrease in SOX2 expression, and this
appears to be due to a direct effect of NFATc1 on SOX2
transcription [62]. In other studies, stable overexpression
of SOX2 in Patu8988t PDAC cells, which do not express

Stock cultures of T3M4, BxPC3, HPAF-II, and L3.6
PDAC cells and their genetically modified derivatives
(see below) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as
described previously [63]. Doxycycline (Dox, Clontech,
Mountain View, CA) was suspended in phosphate
buffered saline at the indicated concentrations. In all
engineered lines, Flag-tagged SOX2 or SOX2 shRNA
was induced by supplementing the culture medium with
Dox for the times and at the concentrations indicated.
Kinase inhibitors were obtained from companies listed
in Supplementary Table 1. Supplementary Table 1 also
contains the EC50 for each drug used for each cell line
as determined by measurements of cell growth over a 4
day period. The cells were photographed with a Canon
Rebel XTi camera at 10X and/or 25X. For cloning
efficiency assays, cells were plated at clonal densities
(80 cells per cm2) and maintained in serum containing
media (as indicated above). After 8-12 days, the number
of colonies (8 or more cells per colony) was determined
in 15-20 random 40X fields by an observer unaware of
sample designation. For replating efficiency assays, cells
were grown at subconfluent densities for 6 days with or
without treatment in normal media (as indicated above),
at which point the cells were trypsinized and replated at
clonal densities in normal media. After an additional 7 or
11 days, the number of colonies that exhibited 8 or more
cells per colony was determined in 8-15 random 40X
fields by an observer unaware of sample designation. Soft
agar growth assays were performed in serum-free, stem
cell medium, as described previously [63]. The number
of spheres that exhibited 8 or more cells per sphere was
determined, and spheres larger than 50 μm in diameter
were scored as large. MTT assays of triplicate samples
were used to assess relative cell growth, as described
previously [64, 65].

detectable levels of endogenous SOX2, has been shown
to increase expression of Twist, Snail and Slug, while
decreasing the expression of E-Cadherin and ZO-1
[23]. Conversely, knocking down SOX2 in PDAC cells
increases the expression of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 [23].
Collectively, NFATc1 and SOX2 appear to work together
to regulate the expression of genes involved in epithelialmesenchymal transition and cell cycle regulation.
SOX2 not only influences tumor growth, it also
influences responses of tumor cells to drugs used clinically
[9–16]. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time
that inducible elevation of SOX2 in three PDAC cell
lines leads to a reduction in the efficacy of several MEKi,
including trametinib, and the AKTi MK-2206. This is
particularly interesting for two reasons. First, elevation
of SOX2 on its own inhibits growth, but when SOX2 is
elevated it reduces the efficacy of MEKi and AKTi. Thus,
the protective effects of SOX2 against these drugs are
not coupled mechanistically with the effects of SOX2 on
PDAC growth. Second, knockdown of SOX2 in PDAC
cells combined with drug treatment leads to further
reductions in PDAC cell growth. Consequently, SOX2
appears to be a potential therapeutic target for improving
the treatment of patients with SOX2-positive PDAC.
Although it is generally believed that it is very difficult
to develop drugs that directly interfere with the action of
transcription factors, it may be practical to identify small
molecule inhibitors that reduce SOX2 gene expression,
block the downstream mechanisms by which SOX2
reduces efficacy of MEKi and AKTi, or, as discussed
earlier, target genes that work in concert with SOX2 to
promote tumor growth.
In summary, we show here that either increasing
or decreasing SOX2 levels reduces the growth of PDAC
cells in vitro and in vivo. Equally significant, we show that
SOX2 can interfere with the ability of MEKi and AKTi to
reduce the growth of PDAC cells. Going forward, it will
be essential to gain a much deeper understanding of how
SOX2 influences the growth of PDAC. In addition, it will
be valuable to determine how SOX2 can reduce the action
of MEKi and AKTi. The genetically engineered PDAC
cell lines described in this study should provide a highly
useful platform for addressing both of these important
problems.

Cell engineering for SOX2 overexpression and
knockdown
Cell lines were engineered for Dox-inducible SOX2
expression as described previously [43]. Separate lentiviral
vectors were generated with pLVX-tetO-(fs)SOX2 and
with a vector expressing the reverse tet transactivator,
pLVX-Tet-On® Advanced (modified to use a PGK rather
than a CMV promoter) [66]. Cells which successfully
integrated these viral vectors were selected for in medium
containing 5 μg/ml puromycin (P8833, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) for 48 hours and 300 μg/mL G418 sulfate
(#631308, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) for 9-12 days,
respectively. T3M4 cells were first transduced with the
reverse tet transactivator lentiviral vector and a G418resistant clone selected before infection with and selection
for the pLVX-tetO-(fs)SOX2 lentiviral vector, resulting in

i-SOX2-T3M4 cells. The cell lines i-SOX2-BxPC3 and
i-SOX2-HPAF-II were engineered by infection with both
viruses simultaneously prior to selection.
For inducible knockdown of SOX2, T3M4 and L3.6
cell lines were engineered for Dox-inducible expression of
an shRNA using a TRIPZ lentiviral vector obtained from
Open Biosystems (now GE Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO).
This vector, RHS4696-201902991, has a mature antisense
sequence of ACATGCTGATCATGTCCCG, which targets
the ORF of both human and mouse SOX2. In T3M4
cells a second lentiviral vector was used independently.
This second vector, RHS4696-201899634, has a mature
antisense sequence of TTCTTGTCGGCATCGCGGT.
The TRIPZ vector results in puromycin resistance and
constitutive expression of a reverse tet transactivator
as well as Dox-inducible expression of the shRNA and
red fluorescent protein (RFP). I-KdSOX2-T3M4 and
i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cell lines were isolated after puromycin
selection, as described above. The i-KdSOX2-T3M4 cell
population was further enriched by flow cytometry for
cells with higher RFP expression following an 18 hour
induction with 1 μg/mL Dox.

Determination of tumorigenicity
Female NCr-nu/nu mice (4 weeks of age) were
obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA).
All animal procedures were approved by the UNMC
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Where
indicated, 2.5x105 i-SOX2-T3M4 cells or 6.0x105
i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cells were trypsinized, resuspended in
50 μl of sterile PBS, and injected subcutaneously into
the flank. Tumor growth was monitored daily. After
palpable tumors had formed, tumor-bearing mice were
randomized to size-matched control and experimental
(Dox-treated) groups. Dox-treatment for elevation or
knockdown of SOX2 was accomplished by addition
of Dox (2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to
drinking water that contained 5% sucrose. Untreated
mice were provided with 5% sucrose drinking water
as a control. Tumor volumes were calculated based on
measurements with a digital caliper at the times indicated.
At the completion of the tumor growth study, mice were
euthanized and tumors excised for weight measurements
and immunohistochemical analysis. Exponential trend
lines for tumor growth were determined using Microsoft
Excel. Formalin-fixed tumor sections were paraffinembedded and stained for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E),
SMA, and Ki-67 by the University of Nebraska Medical
Center Tissue Sciences Facility. H&E, SMA, and Ki-67
stained photomicrographs were captured using either an
iScan Coreo Au Scanner with iScan Coreo 3.4.0 software
(Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ), or a Nikon
Digital Sight DS-Fi1 camera with NIS Elements 4.0.
software (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY).
Quantification of the stromal component of
tumors was assessed by overlaying a grid on top of
photomicrographs of SMA stained tumor tissues using
Adobe Photoshop 2015.0.1. An area of 1 mm2 was divided
into 864 squares, which were examined for positive
staining, indicating stroma. Two independent tumors from
each treatment condition (e.g. i-SOX2-T3M4 cells or
i-KdSOX2-L3.6 cells, without Dox and with Dox) were
assessed, and the percentages of SMA positive squares
were averaged and standard deviation calculated for each
condition. Proliferation in tumors was assessed by staining
for Ki-67, and counting the number of positively stained
cells out of at least 500 cells, only in the carcinoma or
stromal components of each tumor growth condition. As
with the stromal quantification, two independent tumors
from each treatment condition were scored, and Ki67 incidence in the stroma or carcinoma was averaged
and standard deviation calculated. The student’s T-test
(2-tailed) was used to determine statistical significance (p
< 0.05) using Microsoft Excel for Mac (15.20).

Western blot analysis
Whole cell protein extraction buffer consists of 150
mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% IGEPAL, 0.25%
sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mM EDTA, which were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Whole cell extracts were
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors
for western blot analysis and protein concentrations were
determined as described previously [19, 67]. Protocols
for western blot analysis have been described previously
[68]. SOX2 protein levels were determined with a SOX2
antibody (ab-92494, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, 1:1,000);
ERK1/2 phospho-protein levels were determined with a
phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (#9106, Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, 1:1,000). HDAC1 was used as
the loading control and probed with an HDAC1 antibody
(ab-7028, Abcam, 1:5,000). SOX2 and HDAC1 primary
antibodies were detected with an anti-rabbit-IgG-AP
secondary antibody (A3687, Sigma-Aldrich,1:10,000);
Phospho-ERK1/2 primary antibody was detected with an
anti-mouse-IgG-AP secondary antibody (A4312, SigmaAldrich,1:10,000).

Cell cycle analysis
I-SOX2-T3M4 cells were seeded at subconfluent
densities in the presence or absence of Dox (300 ng/ml)
and MEKi were added the following day. After 3 days
treatment with each MEKi in the presence or absence of
Dox, cells were prepared for cell cycle analysis by the
Telford Method, as described previously [69]. Floating
cells were included in the cell cycle analysis. Flow
