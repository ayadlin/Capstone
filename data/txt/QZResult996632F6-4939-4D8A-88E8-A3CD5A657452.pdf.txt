ABSTRACT
Even if ovarian cancer patients are very responsive to a cisplatinum-based
therapy, most will relapse with a resistant disease. New experimental animal models
are needed to explore the mechanisms of resistance, to better tailor treatment and
improve patient prognosis. To address these aims, seven patient-derived high-grade
serous/endometrioid ovarian cancer xenografts were characterized for the antitumor
response after one and two cycles of cisplatinum and classified as Very Responsive,
Responsive, and Low Responsive to drug treatment. Xenografts re-growing after
the first drug cycle were much less responsive to the second one. The expression of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) genes was
investigated in cisplatinum-treated and not-treated tumors. We found that different
EMT (TCF3, CAMK2N1, EGFR, and IGFBP4) and CSCs (SMO, DLL1, STAT3, and ITGA6)
genes were expressed at higher levels in Low Responsive than in Responsive and Very
Responsive xenografts. The expression of STAT3 was found to be associated with
lower survival (HR = 13.7; p = 0.013) in the TCGA patient data set. MMP9, CD44, DLL4,
FOXP1, MERTK, and PTPRC genes were found more expressed in tumors re-growing
after cisplatinum treatment than in untreated tumors. We here describe a new in vivo
ovarian carcinoma experimental setting that will be instrumental for specific trials
of combination therapy to counteract cisplatinum resistance in order to improve the
prognosis of ovarian patients.

INTRODUCTION

and platinum compounds are the standard adjuvant therapy
in EOC and have greatly improved overall survival (OS)
with 70% of patients achieving complete remission after
first-line platinum-based therapy. Unfortunately, almost
all patients relapse with a resistant disease. Tumors are
clinically classified as responsive or not to a platinum
(DDP)-based therapy depending on the time to relapse
from the end of adjuvant therapy. Specifically, they are
classified as refractory if progressing during treatment,

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a serious medical
problem, with more than 100,000 women dying per year
in western countries [1]. The relatively asymptomatic
nature of ovarian cancer and the lack of adequate screening
tests result in 75% of patients being diagnosed at late
FIGO stages (III and IV). Standard treatment involves
cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy. Taxol

resistant if relapsing within twelve months, and sensitive
if relapsing after twelve months [2]. This classification
is important as it dictates the subsequent chemotherapy.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the sensitivity
or resistance to DDP will help in tailoring ovarian cancer
treatment, and possibly to improve the prognosis. The
molecular mechanisms of resistance to a DDP-based
therapy are multifactorial, and include mechanisms
interfering with drug transport, with the repair of the DDPinduced DNA damage, with DDP-induced signalling to the
apoptotic machinery, up- and down-regulated expression
of miRNAs, and others [3]. Both the activation of the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and the
existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been advocated
as possible mechanisms of relapse in different tumor types,
including ovarian carcinomas [4–5]. However, most of
these data come from cell cultures assays, and few studies
are based on paired primary and recurrent epithelial ovarian
cancer samples [4–10]. More appropriate in vivo models
are needed to recapitulate the primary and secondary/
acquired DDP resistance in ovarian cancer patients.
We recently characterized a panel of patientderived xenografts (PDXs) from fresh ovarian tumor
samples transplanted in nude mice [11]. These PDXs
well reproduce the biological behaviour of the disease,
including the heterogeneous response to a platinum-based
therapy. Here we describe an experimental setting in which
ovarian PDX-bearing mice were treated with one cycle of
cisplatinum (cDDP), consisting of the drug given once a
week for three weeks. Then, the regrowing tumors were
re-challenged with a second cycle of treatment. These
experiments clearly demonstrate not only that cDDP has a
wide range of efficacy, as already reported, but that tumors
regrowing after one cDDP treatment are less sensitive to a
second cycle. In this experimental setting, we investigated
the role of genes involved in EMT and stemness pathways
in the response to cDDP.

in Table 1 and Figure 1 different responses to cDDP
treatment were observed. Xenografts #212 and #230 were
extremely sensitive to cDDP treatment (T/C% values of
0.9% and 1.2%, respectively), showing not only tumor
regressions, but also cures with 6 out of 9, and 6 out of 8
mice cured, respectively. These PDXs were classified as
Very Responsive (VR) (Table 1). Xenografts #124, #218
and #239 were classified as Responsive (R) to cDDP with
T/C% values of 3.8%, 10.3%, and 14.2%. In particular,
these tumors underwent regressions after the first cycle of
cDDP, but eventually they all re-start to grow. Xenografts
#154 and #258 were less responsive to cDDP, with T/C%
of 38.5% and 36.5%, with no sign of regression following
cDDP treatment. They were classified as Low Responsive
(LR). The different responses to cDDP did not seem to be
dependent on tumor growth, as VR and LR xenografts had
similar growth rates (Supplementary Figure 1).
When a second cycle of cDDP was given to the
tumors regrowing after the first cycle, the antitumor
activity was lower, especially in R xenografts. In order
to evaluate the response to the second cDDP treatment,
the slopes of the interpolation lines of the tumor growth
curves were considered. Indeed, the calculation of the
T/C% was not possible as most of the mice belonging
to the control group was already dead by the time of the
second cDDP cycle. Figure 2 reports the values of the
different slopes obtained in untreated and cDDP-treated
tumors (after the first and the second cycle). In particular,
after the first cycle VR and R tumors (#212, #230, #124,
#218, and #239) showed regressions, as suggested by
the negative values of tumor growth slopes. On the other
hand, positive slopes were observed in R xenografts #124,
#218, and #239 after the second cDDP cycle, indicating
a lower drug response. In LR xenografts (#154, #258)
slopes were no statistically different in control-untreated
and treated with one or two cDDP cycles.

EMT and CSCs gene expression and response to
cDDP

RESULTS

The experimental setting described above, and the
different cDDP responses observed in the PDXs prompted
us to investigate the role of EMT and CSCs-related genes
in the responses to cDDP. The expression of these genes
was investigated using high-throughput 384-well plates
pre-filled with primers for EMT/CSCs genes in untreated
and relapsing cDDP treated-tumors of VR (#212, #230),
R (#124, #218, #239) and LR (#154, #258) xenografts.
This approach has already been used successfully [12, 13].
All the regrowing-treated tumors were collected after
a mean of 33 days after the last cDDP treatment (range
14–45 days), so any short-term effect of drug treatment
can be reasonably excluded.
To assess the predictive role of genes involved in
these pathways, the LR tumor group was enriched with
samples from cDDP-treated relapsing xenografts, as

Response of serous/endometrioid ovarian
carcinoma xenografts to cDDP
We selected seven high grade serous/endometrioid
ovarian PDXs (Table 1) of our recently established ovarian
xenobank [11]. The characteristics of the patients from
whom the xenografts were derived are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1. We focused on these two high
grade tumor histotypes as they represent the majority of
ovarian carcinomas, and have similar clinical courses
and responses to therapy. Of note, the two endometrioid
PDXs were obtained from relapsing patients, likely with
a more aggressive phenotype. These xenografts were
challenged for the response to cDDP. A first cycle of
cDDP was given by intravenous injection once a week
for three weeks at the dose of 5 mg/kg. As depicted

(Matrix-Metalloproteinase 9, p = 0.00013) had a lower
expression in VR than R and LR tumors. The analysis
on CSCs genes showed that 17 genes were differently
expressed in LR, R and VR xenografts (data not shown).
The genes differentially expressed among VR, R and LR
that present the lowest p values were the following: SMO
(Smoothened-Frizzled class receptor, p = 8.41E-05), STAT3
(Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3,
p = 0.0011), DLL1 (Delta-Like 1, p = 0.0035), and ITGA6

they all were less sensitive to the drug (Figure 2). Five
EMT related genes were expressed at higher levels
in LR xenografts (Figure 3, panel A). In particular,
TCF3 (Transcription Factor 3, p = 0.006) showed an
increasing gene expression from VR to LR xenografts,
while CAMK2N1 (Calcium/calmodulin-Dependent

Prognostic value of genes found to be predictive
of cDDP response in ovarian cancer patients

Expression of EMT and CSCs genes in cDDPtreated/regrowing versus untreated tumors

Having found that some genes involved in EMT
and CSCs pathways were predictive of cDDP response
in our experimental system, we looked for correlations
between their expression and survival in patients. Data
of genome-wide gene expression and survival of high
grade ovarian cancer patients were downloaded from the
TCGA database. In particular, 261 patients were available
for survival analysis. After a median follow-up of 57.6
months (IQR: 21.2–115.9 months), 147 (56.3%) deaths
were registered. As reported in Table 2 and showed in
Supplementary Figure 2, STAT3 was strongly associated
with OS (HR = 13.68; p = 0.013), with higher levels
being associated with a lower survival. In addition, the
analysis demonstrated that the HR was dependent on time
(time interaction p = 0.014). Specifically, the increase
of the expression of STAT3 significantly correlated
with an increased HR up to the 12 months considered

The expression of EMT and CSCs genes was
investigated in cDDP-treated regrowing and in the
corresponding untreated xenografts in a comparative
pair-wise analysis. The analysis was done only in R
xenografts (#124, #218, and #239), as all these models
were sensitive to the first cDDP challenge, and after
regrowing were much less sensitive to the second one
(Figure 2). Figure 4 shows the levels of the differently
expressed EMT (MMP9) and CSCs genes (CD44 antigen;
DLL4- Delta like 4; FOXP1- Forkhead box P1; MERTK-C
mer protocogene tyrosine kinase; PTPRC- Protein
tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C, and LIN28B- Lin28
homolog B) (p < 0.05) and the corresponding relative delta
values (log2). All the genes, except LIN28B that showed
a downregulation, were upregulated in the cDDP-treated
relapsing relative to untreated xenografts.

as VR, R and LR; interestingly enough, R xenografts
regrowing after one cDDP cycle were much less responsive
to a second treatment. Both the different cDDP responses
of PDXs and the fact that cDDP-treated regrowing tumors
are less responsive to a second cDDP cycle mirror the
clinical setting; 2) among the EMT and CSCs-related
genes found to be associated to the response to cDDP,
STAT3 could be validated in a cohort of ovarian patients;
3) in cDDP-treated regrowing tumors the levels of several
genes involved in EMT and stemness were increased; 4)
these results were obtained in both high grade serous and
endometrioid histotypes suggesting a possible role of EMT
and CSCs also in this latter type of tumor.
This experimental setting relies on PDXs recently
stabilized in our laboratory [11], and shows how the cDDP
activity can be monitored in a longitudinal way within the
same cohort of mice bearing ovarian PDXs for a long time
(up to 150 days). These models were exploited to better
understand the molecular mechanisms of cDDP resistance.
Indeed, cDDP responsive PDXs are much less sensitive
to a second cDDP cycle, mirroring the clinical setting [2],
reinforcing the value of these PDXs for in vivo studies on
cDDP resistance. Most data on DDP resistance are based on
in vitro cell lines, and very few in vivo results exist on gene
modulation in representative ovarian xenografts models
[14–16]. Considering that both the EMT and stemness
pathways have been variably associated with DDP-resistant
relapses in ovarian carcinomas [17, 18], we wondered
whether the genes involved in these pathways could help
predicting the platinum response in our experimental
setting. Unlike other studies whose observation time was
short [15], we focused on the expression of these genes in
tumors regrowing after two cDDP cycles, a situation that
mirrors tumor ovarian relapses in the clinic much better.
Four EMT related genes, TCF3, CAMK2N1, EGFR,
and IGFBP4, were significantly more expressed in LR
than in R and VR xenografts. The greater expression of
TCF3(E2A) and CAMK2N1 might underlie the activation
of the Wnt pathway by both the canonical/β-catenin
dependent way and the non-canonical one [19]. The
over-expression of EGFR was reported to be involved in
EMT activation via the Akt/Erk1/2 pathways, inducing
Vimentin expression and dowregulation of E-cadherin
favoring invasiveness in ovarian cancer cells [20]. On the
other hand, the recently suggested role of EGFR in the
repair of DNA damage induced by IR and cDDP suggests
an increased repair in LR xenografts [21]. IGFBP4 is an
important senescence-inducing factor in mesenchymalstem cells (MCS), reducing cell growth and is associated
with a lower DNA-damage response and less nuclear
phospho/activated-ERK in senescent than young MSCs
[22]. IGFBPs, by recruiting IFG proteins, inhibit their
ability to activate their receptor IGFR, and downstream
regulators such as PI3K and ERK [23]. We might speculate
that the overexpression of IGFBP4 in R and LR xenografts
by inducing senescence or breaking the cell cycle in tumor
cells might enable them to counteract cDDP activity.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Among the genes involved in stemness whose
upregulation inversely correlated with the cDDP response
in the xenografts tested, we found those engaged in
Hedgehog (i.e. SMO), and Notch (DLL1) pathways. These
pathways are also involved in the regulation of the EMT
and are reported to be associated with drug resistance
in different tumors, including ovarian tumors [24, 25].
Selective inhibition or knockdown of SMO and other
Hedgehog downstream effectors (e.g. Gli1) increased
cDDP sensitivity in ovarian cancer cell cultures and
xenografts [26].
The role of STAT3 in cancer development and drug
response has been recently reviewed [27]. Its inhibition
has been shown to have antitumor activity, and to reverse
the sensitivity to therapy in different cancer types [28–30],
including ovarian cancer [31, 32]. Recently, a STAT3 role
in DDP resistance and acquisition of stem-like features by
STAT3 activation has also been described [33]. We found
that STAT3 expression was inversely correlated with cDDP
response, and that its low levels predicted an increased
overall survival in DDP treated ovarian cancer patients
up to 12 months from diagnosis. The predictive value of
STAT3 was lost over time, but patients with high STAT3
tumor level might have an higher risk of early relapse and
could be treated more extensively.
The role of Notch signaling in the development of
platinum and paclitaxel resistance has been reported in
ovarian cancer [34, 35]. Despite the negative results of a
phase II study of RO4929097, a gamma-secretase inhibitor,
as single agent in recurrent-platinum resistant ovarian
cancer [36], further studies are warranted to test Notch
inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy. The increased
expression of ITGA6 we found predictive of cDDP response
is in line with the literature as well. ITGA6 expression levels
were indeed associated with the presence of cancer stemlike cells [37, 38], as well as with an invasive phenotype,
with drug resistance and poor prognosis [39] in a metastatic
xenograft model [40]. Scant data exist on its role in
predicting DDP response in ovarian cancer [41].
When we looked for genes upregulated in regrowing
than “primary” tumors in a comparative pair-wise
analysis, we found genes belonging to the extracellular
matrix components (i.e. MMP9), to CSCs self-renewal
maintenance (i.e. FOXP1), CSCs markers (i.e. CD44,
PTPRC), and gene involved in MER-TK signaling
pathway; the only downregulated gene was LIN28B.
MMP9 mRNA expression was found enhanced in the
ascites of chemoresistant ovarian cancer patients [42], and
a recent meta-analysis indicated its positive association
with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer [43]. FOXP1
expression was an independent risk factor associated with
chemotherapy resistance and the prognosis of patients
with ovarian cancer [44]. Among the CSC-related genes,
to our knowledge no data are available on the role of
MERTK in ovarian cancer. However, its over-expression
has been associated with tumor progression and
therapy response in lung cancer and leukemia [45–47].

Xenograft models

We detected increased CD44 expression in treated
regrowing xenografts, corroborating its recently reported
higher expression in recurrent and metastatic ovarian
samples than their primary counterparts [48]. However,
even CD44+ cell enrichment has been reported in the
majority of ovarian cancer samples after neoadjuvant
therapy, no significant association with chemoresistance
was reported and a decrease in CD44 expression was
associated with shorter survival [49].
The present findings corroborate the utility of
ovarian PDXs for studying the molecular determinants of
cDDP response. In this experimental setting, mice bearing
ovarian PDXs were treated with different rounds of cDDP,
and followed in a longitudinal way, mirroring the clinical
situation. We found that the expression of some genes is
associated with the response to cDDP in both high grade
serous and endometrioid tumors, opening the way to test
specific target inhibitors to increase cDDP activity in these
tumor histotypes. The enrichment of genes involved in the
EMT and CSC pathways underscore their importance in
cDDP-treated re-growing tumors, although the specific
molecular mechanisms at their basis (selection or
induction) have still to be defined. The PDXs models we
have set up will be instrumental for addressing specific
trials of combination therapy to counteract resistance to
cDDP based therapy with the final aim of improving the
prognosis of ovarian cancer patients.

We have recently characterized and stabilized
a xenobank of ovarian carcinoma from fresh tumor
samples. As reported, these PDX models recapitulate
the tumor from which they derived and maintained
these characteristics for multiple passages [11]. From
this xenobank we selected seven PDXs: MNHOC124,
MNHOC154, MNHOC218, MNHOC212, MNHOC230,
MNHOC239, and MNHOC258 (referred to as #124,
#154, #218, #212, #230, #239, and #258), whose main
characteristics are reported in Supplementary Table 1.
Viable tumor fragments (2 × 2 mm) were subcutaneously
(s.c.) implanted through trocar needles and mice were
randomized when the average tumor size was about
120 mg (8–10 per group, on the basis of pragmatic
considerations). Cisplatinum (cDDP, Sigma-Aldrich) was
given i.v. at the dose of 5 mg/kg once a week for three
times (q7d × 3). The second cDDP cycle treatment was
generally given when tumors started to re-growth (when
tumor weights were ≥ 3 fold those at randomization), and
were in the range of 400–1000 mg. Tumor growth was
measured twice a week with a Vernier caliper, and tumor
weights (mg = mm3) were calculated as follows: (length
[mm]*width [mm]2)/2. The efficacy of the treatment
was expressed as best tumor growth inhibition [%T/C
= (tumor weight mean of treated tumors/tumor weight
mean of control tumors)*100]. Drug activity was defined
as follows: low responsive (LR) with T/C% ≥ 30% and
no regression, responsive (R) with 10% < T/C% < 30%
with observed regressions followed by tumor re-growth,
and very responsive (VR) with T/C% ≤ 10% and with
regressions but no tumor re-growth.
The cDDP effect was also quantified extrapolating
the slope of the growth curves of the control/untreated and
cDDP-treated tumors. The tumor growth curves for each
mouse were plotted on a logarithmic scale, and the slope of
the interpolation line was calculated; the mean ± standard
error of the slopes for each group (control, first cycle and
second cycle-treated; these latter slopes were calculated
considering the re-growing phase of the tumours after the
first cDDP cycle treatment) was calculated and plotted
as histograms. Statistical analysis was done by one-way
ANOVA test, with GraphPad Prism 3.01 software.

High-throughput gene expression real time assay
Total mRNA was extracted from snap-frozen tissues
by using Maxwell 16 LEV SimplyRNA (Promega),
according to manufacturer protocols. Control/no treated
(CTR) and cDDP-treated re-growing tumors (after the
second cDDP cycle) were snap-frozen at the time of
sacrifice, when tumor weights were about 400–1000 mg.
The RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays (Qiagen) are designed to

analyze a panel of genes related to EMT and CSCs. Each
array contains a panel of 4X96 primer sets for a thoroughly
researched set of 84 genes, plus five housekeeping genes,
three mRNA retrotranscription and three PCR quality
controls. For each plate two control/no-treated and
two cDDP-treated samples of the same xenograft were
included, except for MNHOC212 and MNHOC230 for
which only control no-treated samples were analyzed. The
assay includes a specific step of mRNA retro-transcription,
using the RT2 First Strand Kit. The plate was filled by
an EP Motion 5075 robot (Eppendorf), so an excess of
volume was used. Reactions were done on a 7900HT
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).

(slightly below the maximum collected follow-up time).
Tertiles of gene expression levels were used to plot and
describe survival.

contributions of the Italian Association for Cancer
Research (IG14536 to G.D.).

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

Real-time PCR data were pre-processed with
DataAssist software (v.2, Life Technologies), using
the geometric mean of the available and appropriate
housekeeping genes as endogenous control (ACTB, B2M
and HPRT1 for EMT plates; ACTB, B2M, GAPDH,
HPRT1 and RPLP0 for CSC plates). Data were expressed
as arbitrary base-2 logarithmic units (2-deltaCt). Statistical
analysis was done with the tMEV suite (http://www.tm4.
org [50]) using one-way ANOVA for the genes associated
with responsiveness, and a paired t-test for the long-term
effects of cDDP on the responsive xenografts. Validation
assays were done by real-time PCR with ad-hoc designed
primers (Primer3, http://primer3.ut.ee/) only for the
analysis of the predictive value of genes, as the different
samples run on different plates. Gene expression data
were quantified through a calibration curve, and were
normalized by gene expression of an housekeeping gene
(HPRT1). Statistical analysis was done by t-test, using
GraphPad Prism 3.01 software.

Gene expression (IlluminaHISeq UNC platform)
and survival data were collected from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA, http://cancergenome.nih.gov/)
in May 2015. Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the
time from diagnosis to the time of death from any cause;
data was right-censored if a patient was alive at the last
follow-up. The hazard ratio (HR) was used as summary
statistics correlating gene expression with OS. A linear
log10 time-by-gene interaction term was introduced into
the Cox regression model to detect a time varying HR.
In case of curvature over time of the relative hazard
function, the restricted mean to time t* was used as
summary statistic correlating gene expression with
OS; t* was considered as 6 months (patients relapsing
by 6 months are classified as resistant to therapy),
12 months (patients relapsing between 6 and 12 months
are classified as responsive to therapy), and 60 months
