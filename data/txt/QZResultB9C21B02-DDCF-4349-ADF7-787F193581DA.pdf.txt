ABSTRACT
The majority of human breast cancers express estrogen receptor alpha (ER),
which is important for therapy with anti-estrogens. Here we describe the role of
BCL9-2, a proto-oncogene previously characterized as co-activator of Wnt/ß-catenin
signaling, for mammary tumorigenesis in mice and human. ER positive human breast
cancers showed overexpression of BCL9-2 and tamoxifen treated patients with high
BCL9-2 demonstrated a better survival. BCL9-2 was upregulated during puberty and
pregnancy in normal mammary epithelia, but downregulated in the involuted gland.
BCL9-2 overexpression in vivo delayed the mammary involution and induced alveolar
hyperplasia. Moreover, aged BCL9-2 transgenic mice developed ductal-like mammary
tumors with high nuclear ER expression. We found, that primary cell cultures of BCL92 breast tumors responded to tamoxifen treatment. Moreover, BCL9-2 regulated the
expression of ER and the proliferation of human breast cancer cells independently
of ß-catenin. Finally, we describe a novel mechanism, how BCL9-2 regulates ER
transcription by interaction with Sp1 through the proximal ESR1 gene promoter. In
summary, BCL9-2 induces ER positive breast cancers in vivo, regulates ER expression
by a novel ß-catenin independent mechanism in breast cancer cells, and might predict
the therapy response to tamoxifen treatment.

INTRODUCTION

breast cancers [2]. In contrast, transcriptional regulation
of the ESR1 gene promoter was described in a number of
studies to be an important mechanism for overexpression
and maintenance of ER expression in breast tumors [1].
One of the most important regulators of ER transcription is
Sp1 (specificity protein 1) that is overexpressed in human
ER positive (ER+) breast cancers [4]. Sp1 binds to several
G/C-rich elements located within the proximal promoter
and initiates the transcription of ER in breast cancer cells
together with several co-factors of the basal transcription
machinery [5-7].
So far, only few genetic mouse models have been
established that recapitulate human ER+ breast cancers [8].
Most animal models, including mutants for components

Expression of nuclear estrogen receptor alpha
(ER) predicts the prognosis and the therapy response to
anti-estrogens of human breast cancer [1]. Upon binding
of the estrogen ligand, the receptor is translocated to
the nucleus and binds to the DNA of target genes that
promote tumorigenesis but also regulate transcription of
the receptor itself [1]. In fact, regulation of ER expression
is modulated on the transcriptional level, by protein
modification or degradation [2; 3]. However, the molecular
mechanisms that maintain ER expression in breast cancer
are not well understood [1]. Amplifications of the ESR1
gene (which encodes ER) are only found in up to 20% of

of canonical Wnt-signaling, develop ER negative breast
cancers [8]. The Wnt/ß-catenin pathway controls stem
cell maintenance and differentiation in different organs,
and aberrant activation of canonical Wnt-signaling is
also implicated in breast cancer [9; 10]. The signaling
activity of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway is modulated by
the members of the Legless/B-Cell Lymphoma 9 (Lgs/
BCL9) and Pygopus gene families [11-14]. The BCL9
and Pygopus co-factors establish a nuclear complex with
ß-catenin/Lef/Tcf’s and regulate the transcriptional output
of the pathway. In contrast to the essential function of
the Drosophila Lgs/BCL9 and Pygopus genes for Wnt
signaling during embryonic development, the mammalian
orthologs act as specific co-factors to enhance Wnt activity
beyond a certain threshold during embryogenesis and
tumorigenesis [15-17]. We have previously characterized
the proto-oncogene BCL9-2 (BCL9L, B-Cell Lymphoma
9–like) which augments Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and
promotes intestinal tumor progression [11; 15; 18].
Moreover, recent data indicated that the function of BCL9
and Pygopus proteins is apparently not limited to the
canonical Wnt pathway in mice and human [14; 15; 17].
So far, the role of de-regulated Wnt-signaling in
breast tumorigenesis is controversial, since activating
mutations of ß-catenin or loss of the Adenomatous
Polyposis Coli (APC) gene product are uncommon in
human breast cancer [19]. In general, hyperactivated Wnt/
ß-catenin signaling in human and mice is linked to basallike breast cancers that are hormone receptor negative
[19]. For instance, genetic mouse mutants with truncated
APC, stabilized ß-catenin or overexpression of Wnt10b
develop basal-like, triple-negative breast cancers and show
in part squamous metaplasia, which is unusual for human
breast cancer [20-24]. In contrast, activation of the Wnt1
proto-oncogene results in the formation of ER+ ductal-like
breast cancers, presumably by Wnt/ß-catenin independent
mechanisms [25-27].
Here we describe a novel ß-catenin independent
role of the nuclear co-factor BCL9-2 for the development
of ER+ breast cancers. We report, that BCL9-2
overexpression in vivo leads to premalignant alterations
in the breast and induces mammary tumors in aged
mice with high nuclear ER expression that resemble
ductal-like human breast cancers. Mechanistically, we
provide evidence that BCL9-2 transcriptionally regulates
ER expression in breast cancer cells independently of
ß-catenin. We identify a novel interaction with Sp1, which
controls ER expression though transcriptional regulation
of the proximal ESR1 gene promoter. Our results are of
clinical significance, since we show that BCL9-2 is also
highly expressed in ER+ human breast cancers and might
predict the therapy response of tamoxifen treated breast
cancer patients.

BCL9-2 is highly upregulated in human ER+
breast cancers and might be predictive for the
response to tamoxifen therapy
Since BCL9 proteins are implicated in cancer
development and progression, we analyzed their
expression and role in normal and malignant breast tissues.
First, we characterized BCL9 proteins in human tissue
samples and during different stages of postnatal mammary
gland development in the mouse (Fig. 1 and 2, Suppl. Fig.
1). For immunostains we used our specific antibodies
against BCL9 and BCL9-2 [15] and re-confirmed their
specificity on mammary tissues by peptide competition
(Suppl. Fig. 1D-F).
We performed immunohistochemistry and
immunofluorescence analyses on commercially available
tissue microarrays containing matched samples of
adjacent normal and breast cancer samples (Fig. 1A, B
and Suppl. Fig.1A-C). We found that BCL9 was strongly
expressed in epithelial cells of normal mammary tissues
and was equally high in breast cancers (Suppl. Fig. 1A,
B). In contrast, we detected only weak expression of
BCL9-2 in normal breast tissues, whereas it was highly
expressed in tumors, especially in ER+ cancers (Fig.
1A). We additionally performed co-immunofluorescence
studies for BCL9-2 and ER to analyze their co-localization
and for SMA (smooth muscle actin) that is expressed
in myofibroblasts of the mammary gland (Fig. 1B and
Suppl. Fig.1C). In the adjacent normal breast, BCL9-2
was not detectable and nuclear ER was limited to single
luminal cells that were surrounded by SMA positive
myofibroblasts. In contrast, BCL9-2 was strongly
expressed in the nuclei of breast tumor cells that also coexpressed nuclear ER and were negative for SMA (Fig. 1B
and Suppl. Fig.1C). These data confirm that BCL9-2 and
ER co-localize in the nuclei of breast cancer cells.
Next we scored the immunohistochemistry staining
intensity and the percentage of positive cells for BCL9-2
in a larger series of human breast cancer cases on tissue
microarrays as previously described [15] (Fig. 1C, D).
Scoring of the stains revealed that BCL9-2 was indeed
significantly increased in all cancers cases compared to
normal breast tissues (Fig. 1C; P=0.001), with highest
expression in well differentiated tumors (P=0.005, 0.002
and 0.046 for G1, G2 and G3, respectively). Moreover, we
scored different cancer subtypes based on their ER, PR,
and Her2 expression (see Suppl. Material and Methods)
and confirmed highest levels of BCL9-2 in ER+ cancers.
In detail, BCL9-2 was not elevated in triple negative
cancers (P=0.22), but in Her2+ tumors (P=0.005). ER/
PR positive cancers, with and without Her2 expression,
showed highly significant upregulated BCL9-2 (P=0.002
6771

and P<0.0001, respectively; Fig. 1A, D).
We also assessed the clinical significance of BCL92 for the survival of ER+ breast cancer patients (Fig.
1E). For this, we re-evaluated microarray data from over
250 patients with early stage breast cancer and proven
positive ER status [GSE 6532, 28]. We correlated BCL92 expression with the clinical outcome of the patients.
First we separated high BCL9-2 (n=129 cases) versus low
BCL9-2 (n=134) based on the median gene expression

of all tumor samples. In fact, BCL9-2 correlated again
with the pathological grade of the tumors and the overall
survival (not shown). Remarkably, tamoxifen treated
patients with high BCL9-2 in the tumors showed a
significantly better survival than patients with low BCL92 (P<0.0045; Fig. 1E). In summary, BCL9-2 is highly
expressed in ER+ human breast cancers and might predict
the response to tamoxifen treatment.

relative to the median expression of all samples. Significance was calculated using the Cox Proportional Hazard Model.

BCL9-2 is highly expressed in the normal
mammary gland during puberty and pregnancy,
but downregulated in the involuted breast

the adult mammary gland and finally limited to single
cells in the mature, involuted mammary epithelia of
aged animals. Nuclear ER also dropped during postnatal
development and was limited to few single mammary cells
in aged mice. Highest BCL9-2 was again detected in late
pregnancy, concomitant with strong cytoplasmatic and
nuclear ER expression. During postlactational involution
of the breast, BCL9-2 and ER were only weakly detectable
in the remaining collapsed alveoli. After completion of the
postlactational involution, BCL9-2 was again similarly
low as in the virgin adult ductal epithelium. Thus, BCL92 and ER are highly expressed in the normal mammary
epithelium during puberty and pregnancy. In contrast,
BCL9-2 expression is almost completely lost in the
postlactational and age-related involuted mammary gland.

Next, we characterized the expression of BCL9
proteins during different stages of postnatal mammary
gland development in the mouse (Fig. 2 and Suppl. Fig. 1).
We stained mammary tissues of pubertal, virgin, pregnant
and aged wild-type mice. BCL9 was strongly expressed
in mammary epithelial cells at all ages (Suppl. Fig. 1DF). In contrast, we detected strong BCL9-2 expression
during puberty and in the pregnant mammary gland,
while it was low in the involuted breast of aged animals
and after pregnancy (Fig. 2). We asked if the BCL9-2
expression pattern correlates with ER expression in the
postnatal mammary gland. For this we stained sequential
tissue sections for BCL9-2 and ER (Fig. 2, left panel)
and performed co-immunofluorescence stains of BCL92, ER, ß-catenin and SMA (Fig. 2, right panel). The
terminal end buds of the outgrowing ducts in the pubertal
mammary gland strongly expressed both, BCL9-2 and
nuclear ER. In contrast, BCL9-2 was downregulated in

overexpression of BCL9-2 in transgenic mice. Our K19BCL9-2 mouse model (on a pure C57BL/6 background)
induces BCL9-2 overexpression by the Keratin 19 (K19)
gene promoter, which targets in the breast fully developed
luminal cells and putative luminal progenitors [15; 29;
30]. We asked if BCL9-2 overexpression may affect the
normal postnatal mammary development or can induce
atypical preneoplastic lesions in vivo. For this, we
analyzed BCL9-2 mice and age-matched non-transgenic
controls by immunohistochemistry on tissue sections and
carmine whole mount stains (Fig. 3).

First, we studied the postlactational involution in
young animals after pregnancy (Fig. 3A). Remarkably,
the remodeling of the breast to the prepregnant state was
delayed in BCL9-2 transgenic females. The mammary
glands retained large alveoli with high BCL9-2 that were
actively proliferating as detected by BrdU stains. At this
stage, alveoli of non-transgenic controls were collapsed,
did not proliferate and BCL9-2 was low (Fig. 3A).
We also analyzed mammary tissues from aged
control and BCL9-2 transgenic mice. Breast tissues of
BCL9-2 overexpressing animals frequently showed

macroscopically hyperplastic mammary glands with
enlarged ducts, which was confirmed by carmine stains
and on tissue sections (Fig. 3B, C and Fig. 4A). We
scored the changes of mammary epithelium detected by
carmine stains (see Suppl. Material and Methods) and
found that the alveolar differentiation persisted and that
the ducts were strongly dilated in aged BCL9-2 animals.
At this stage, age-matched controls had almost completely
lost all alveolar structures and the gland contained only
large, undilated ducts (Fig. 3B, C). Moreover, BCL9-2
mice developed significantly more and larger hyperplastic
alveolar nodules (HANs). Tissue sections of the transgenic

glands were strongly positive for BCL9-2 and nuclear ER
within the hyperplastic alveolar epithelium (Fig. 3C).
Moreover, the alveolar foci were actively proliferating
as indicated by BrdU stains. In contrast, the BCL9-2, ER
and BrdU stains were restricted to single epithelial cells
within larger ducts in the involuted mammary glands of
aged control females (Fig. 3C). In summary, BCL9-2
overexpression induces premalignant changes of the breast
and delays the normal postlactational and age-related
mammary involution. Thus, sustained BCL9-2 expression
in vivo might confer an increased risk for breast tumor
development by inducing atypical preneoplastic lesions.

Transgenic BCL9-2 overexpression induces ER+
mammary tumors in aged mice

staining (Fig. 4F and Suppl. Fig. 2A).
The lobular-like BCL9-2 cancers were composed
of highly proliferative, monomorphic tumor cells that
had lost all epithelial markers including the expression
of E-cadherin (Suppl. Fig. 2C). BCL9-2 and luminal
epithelial markers were restricted to the few remaining
ductal-like structures and to single cells within the tumors.
However, lobular-like cancers also expressed high nuclear
ER (Suppl. Fig. 2C).
In summary, in vivo overexpression of BCL9-2
induces the development of mammary tumors with high
nuclear ER reminiscent of human ductal-like, ER and
BCL9-2 positive breast cancers.

We further monitored BCL9-2 mutant mice up to
two years of age. Age-matched, non-transgenic littermates
or C57BL/6 controls did not develop breast tumors. In
contrast, transgenic females developed rapidly growing,
macroscopic mammary tumors starting at 15 month of
age (Fig. 4A). Tumor risk was significantly increased
with age and tumors developed with similar frequencies
in different founder lines (Fig. 4B and Suppl. Table 1).
Of note, the tumor incidence of parous transgenic females
was also significantly higher than of virgins (26 vs. 16%,
Suppl. Table 1). Expression of the BCL9-2 transgene in
the tumors was confirmed by RT-PCR using transgene
specific primers and by Western Blots of tumor cell lysates
using an antibody directed against the tagged transgene
(Fig. 4C). Moreover, BCL9-2 and ER protein levels
were strongly increased in the tumor cells compared to
mammary control tissues as detected by Western Blots
(Fig. 4C).
The majority of BCL9-2 breast tumors were
histopathologically evaluated as ductal-like mammary
tumors with transition to carcinomas (13 of 20 tumors,
Fig. 4D-F and Suppl. Fig. 2A, B). Moreover, four tumors
showed the morphology of lobular breast cancers as
found in humans and the remaining cases were poorly
differentiated tumors of the mammary gland (Suppl. Fig.
2C).
We further characterized the histopathology of
BCL9-2 tumors by immunohistochemistry and coimmunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 4D-F and Suppl. Fig.
2A-C). We stained the tumors for the expression of BCL92 and hormone receptors. In addition, we performed
staining for the epithelial cell markers Cytokeratin 19
(K19), ß-catenin and E-cadherin. Fibroblasts were stained
with SMA and p63. Importantly, all ductal-like BCL9-2
tumors were highly positive for both BCL9-2 and nuclear
ER, which was confirmed by co-immunofluorescence
staining (Fig. 4 E, F). All ductal-like cancers strongly
expressed K19 and showed membrane bound ß-catenin
and E-cadherin (Fig. 4D-F and Suppl. Fig. 2A, B).
Membranous Her2 was not detectable, indicating that
the tumors mimic the luminal subtype of breast cancer.
SMA expressing cells were negative for K19, while p63
stained the same SMA positive cells in the tumors (Fig.
4F and Suppl. Fig. 2C). Moreover, areas with BCL9-2, ER
positive tumor cells where surrounded by a compartment
with SMA expressing cells (Fig. 4E-F). Similarly, we
found for the majority of breast cancer samples on the
human tissue array the same staining pattern (Fig. 1 B).
Both human and mouse breast cancer tissues demonstrated
that the BCL9-2+, ER+ tumor cell clusters were
surrounded by SMA positive cells, suggesting to represent
a stromal tumor compartment. All mouse BCL9-2 tumors
were highly proliferative as detected by Ki67 and BrdU

Primary BCL9-2 mammary tumor cells respond
to estrogen and tamoxifen treatment
To assess the growth potential and hormone
sensitivity of the BCL9-2 tumors we established primary
cell cultures of BCL9-2 breast tumors and of mammary
glands from age matched, non-transgenic controls (Fig. 5
and Suppl. Fig. 3). We confirmed by immunofluorescence
stains that the primary tumor cells retained all linage
specific markers as detected by immunostains on tumor
tissue sections (Fig. 5A and Suppl. Fig. 3A). The culture
also contained single SMA positive cells. Importantly,
primary tumor cells were highly positive for BCL9-2 and
ER, which co-localized in the nuclei of primary tumor
cells (Fig. 5A).
Next, we analyzed the proliferation capacity of the
primary cells and their response to estrogen and tamoxifen
treatment. Of note, mouse primary tumor cells stopped
proliferating upon complete serum starvation, indicating
that they require growth factors and hormones. Therefore
we kept the cells in the supplemented media as previously
reported for other primary cultures [31] and treated them
with increasing concentrations of estrogen and tamoxifen
(Fig. 5B-F). The proliferation of primary tumor cells
was slightly stimulated in a dose- and time-dependent
manner by estrogen as analyzed by cell viability and BrdU
incorporation assays (Fig. 5B-D). The limited effects of
estrogen might be due to the fact that our primary cells
did not tolerate hormone starvation. We also analyzed
the effects of increasing tamoxifen concentrations on cell
viability and determined a non-toxic concentration for
treatment of the primary cells (Fig. 5B, C). Importantly,
tamoxifen treatment of the primary tumor cells led to a
significant reduction of tumor cell growth even in fully
supplemented culture media within 48 hours as determined
by BrdU incorporation, while control primary cells did not
respond (Fig. 5D).
We next analyzed colony formation and
differentiation capacity of primary cells cultured on a
collagen matrix (Fig. 5E, F). Primary control cells formed
only small colonies within 4 days that did not proliferate

or respond to estrogen and tamoxifen treatment. In
contrast, primary tumor cells developed large colonies,
which also slightly responded to estrogen treatment
with increased colony numbers and larger colonies after
10 days. Remarkably, tamoxifen treatment strongly
reduced colony formation of primary tumor cells within

four days (Fig. 5E). In fact, tamoxifen led to a complete
disintegration of the tumor cell colonies after ten days
(Fig. 5F). Taken together, our data indicate that the growth
of primary BCL9-2 mammary tumor cells is inhibited by
tamoxifen treatment.

BCL9-2 regulates ER signaling in human breast
cancer cells independently of ß-catenin

analyses were quantified as shown in Suppl. Fig. 4D.
Estrogen stimulation led to a complete translocation of the
cytoplasmatic ER pool resulting in increased protein levels
in the nuclei. However, nuclear ER protein was reduced in
estrogen stimulated cells following knockdown of BCL9-2
compared to control siRNA treated cells (Fig. 6D, Suppl.
Fig. 4D).
Next, we asked if BCL9-2 also affects ER signaling.
Knockdown of BCL9-2 strongly reduced the activity of
an ER responsive (ERE) luciferase reporter in MCF7
and T47D cells, both in hormone starved cells and after
stimulation with estrogen (Fig. 6C and Suppl. Fig 5C).
Moreover, we analyzed the expression of the ER target
genes progesterone receptor (PR) and GREB1 (growth
regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1) and asked
if downregulation of ER protein following BCL9-2
knockdown also affects ER target gene expression. In
fact, the RNA levels of PR and GREB1 were significantly
reduced in hormone starved cells when we down-regulated
BCL9-2 (Fig. 6C). PR protein was also reduced 72 hours
after BCL9-2 downregulation (Fig. 6D and Suppl. Fig.
4D). Estrogen treatment induced the expected upregulation
of ER target gene transcription, which did override the
effects of BCL9-2 on ER expression. This may reflect that
the remaining ER protein after BCL9-2 knockdown is still
sufficient to activate the transcription of ER target genes
following estrogen stimulation and thus rescues the effects
of BCL9-2 knockdown.
In addition, we analyzed if BCL9-2 also affects
cell growth. Knockdown of BCL9-2 strongly reduced the
proliferation of hormone starved and estrogen stimulated
cells as determined by BrdU incorporation (Fig. 6E). Of
note, the reduced cell proliferation in BCL9-2 depleted
cells was not compensated by high doses of estrogen
(Fig. 6E). In contrast, knockdown of ß-catenin in MCF7
cells affected neither the ERE reporter activity nor the
expression of ER or the target genes. Furthermore,
knockdown of ß-catenin did not inhibit cell proliferation
(Suppl. Fig. 6C-F). In summary, BCL9-2, but not
ß-catenin, is important for the expression of ER and
regulates the proliferation of human ER+ breast cancer
cells.

Next, we studied the biological function of BCL92 in human breast cancer cells. First, we determined the
expression of endogenous BCL9 and Pygo proteins by
Western Blot and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 6A;
Suppl. Fig. 4A and 5A). BCL9 was found at approximately
equal levels in all breast cancer cell lines. In contrast,
highest BCL9-2 was detected in ER+ MCF7 and T47D
breast cancer cells and in Her2 positive SK-BR-3 cells.
In addition, all three cell lines showed also high Pygo2
expression. Triple negative breast cancer cells and the
fibroblastic MCF10a cells expressed much lower levels of
BCL9-2 (Suppl. Fig. 4A), confirming our data from human
tissue microarrays (see above). Immunofluorescence
analysis revealed that BCL9-2 and ER co-localized in the
nuclei of MCF7 and T47D cells. In contrast, ß-catenin
was located at the cell membrane, but not in the nucleus
together with BCL9-2 or ER in both cell lines (Fig. 6A and
Suppl. Fig. 5A).
We then characterized the role of BCL9-2 in ER+
breast cancer cells by downregulation of the protein and
compared the effects following knockdown of ß-catenin.
We used the combination of two specific siRNAs against
each transcript for RNA interference, which we found to
be most effective for downregulation of the respective
mRNA and protein at low concentration (Suppl. Fig. 4B,
C).
First, we assessed the contribution of BCL9-2 to
Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in these breast cancer cells. The
transcriptional activity of the TOP/FOP Wnt-reporter
was very low in MCF7 and almost not detectable in
T47D cells. Knockdown or overexpression of BCL9-2
or ß-catenin had no significant effect on the Wnt-reporter
activity, even after Wnt3a stimulation (Suppl. Fig. 6 A, B).
Even though TOP/FOP reporter activity might not fully
reveal canonical Wnt signaling activity, these data suggest
that BCL9-2 does not contribute as co-activator for Wnt/ßcatenin signaling in ER+ breast cancer cells.
We further investigated the biological effects of
BCL9-2 in MCF7 and T47D cells (Fig. 6B-E and Suppl.
Fig. 5B-C). For this, we used hormone starved cells and
thereafter re-stimulated with estrogen for 6 and 24 hours.
First, we asked, if BCL9-2 might regulate ER expression.
Remarkably, BCL9-2 knockdown significantly reduced
ER RNA levels in hormone starved cells (Fig. 6B and
Suppl. Fig. 5B). Following estrogen stimulation, RNA
expression of ER was reduced as previously reported
[32]. Interestingly, BCL9-2 RNA expression was also
inhibited by estrogen treatment, suggesting a regulatory
feedback loop also for BCL9-2 expression (Fig. 6B and
Suppl. Fig. 5B). On the protein level, ER was reduced 72
hours after knockdown of BCL9-2, both in the nuclear
and cytoplasmatic fraction of hormone starved cells (Fig.
6D). Data from at least three independent western blot

Our data suggested that BCL9-2 modulates ER
expression on the transcriptional level. To further address
the underlying molecular mechanism, we analyzed the
recruitment of BCL9-2 to the human ESR1 gene promoter
by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and performed
co-immunoprecipitation studies in ER+ breast cancer
cells.

domain, we included transcription factors that were
previously described to bind within the ESR1 gene
promoter and activate ER transcription in breast cancer
cells (Fig. 7A). First, we analyzed three larger regions
in the upstream DNA sequence of the ESR1 gene by
conventional PCR following ChIP. The first fragment
covered the most proximal promoter A [based on the
nomenclature by 33] that is occupied by a complex
containing Sp1, p53 and other factors of the basal
transcription machinery [7]. Although the binding sites
for Sp1 in promoter A have not been described yet, our
analyses using Transfac Patch tool [34] or JASPAR
database [35] revealed that the ESR1 gene promoter A
contains multiple G/C-rich sequences surrounding the
transcription start site.
The second region included promoter B with a
classical G/C box, which has been previously shown to
bind Sp1 in breast cancer cells [5]. Moreover, we analyzed
a region of the more upstream promoter D that contains
an enhancer element (“EH0”) that is also activated in ER+
breast cancer cells [36]. We confirmed the occupancy of
RNA polymerase II, Sp1 and p53 in the proximal promoter
A (Fig. 7B). Remarkably, also BCL9-2 and Pygo2, but
not ß-catenin, were clearly enriched at this region as
demonstrated by repeated ChIP experiments in MCF7
cells. Moreover, BCL9-2 and Sp1 were also present at the
promoter B that contains the G/C box, weakly together
with Pygo2 and p53. In contrast, we did not detect an
apparent enrichment of BCL9-2 or Pygo2 at the distal
promoter D or the control GAPDH promoter (Fig. 7B).
To further confirm the co-occupancy of BCL9-2 and
Sp1 in the most proximal ESR1 gene promoter regions,
we additionally performed re-ChIP experiments. Indeed,
following ChIP with Sp1 we re-immunoprecipitated
both promoter fragments with BCL9-2 (Fig. 7C). Vice
versa, we also found Sp1 after BCL9-2 ChIP, however
weaker possibly due to lower antibody efficacy for the
immunoprecipitated complexes.
To further quantify the enrichment of BCL9-2,
Pygo2 and Sp1, we designed specific primers for promoter
B covering the known G/C Box and for sequences
downstream of the transcription start site of promoter
A that contained additional G/C rich elements (Fig. 7D,
E). We performed qRT-PCR analyses following ChIP
and found again the recruitment of BCL9-2 and Pygo2,
together with Sp1, to promoter A and B of the ESR1 gene,
but not to the GAPDH control (Fig. 7D). Moreover, we
performed ChIP experiments after treatment of MCF7
cells with mithramycin A that inhibits Sp1 binding to the
DNA [6]. We asked if reduced Sp1 binding also decreases
the recruitment of BCL9-2 to the ESR1 gene promoter.
In fact, within 24 hours of mithramycin A treatment, the
recruitment of both Sp1 and BCL9-2 was reduced at both
promoter fragments as determined by qRT-PCR (Fig.
7E). Thus, BCL9-2 regulates ER transcription through
recruitment to DNA sites that are occupied by Sp1 in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

most proximal promoters.
We further analyzed the contribution of BCL9-2 as
co-regulator of ER transcription and performed luciferase
reporter assays in HEK293 cells, which do not express
endogenous BCL9-2, but Sp1 and low levels of ER (Suppl.
Fig. 4A). For this, we generated a minimal luciferase
reporter construct, which covers the most proximal
promoter A and B of the ESR1 gene. Moreover, we
mutated the previously described G/C box in promoter B
and one additional G/C rich element in promoter A based
on our sequence analyses (Fig. 7F). The basal activity of
the wild type ESR1 reporter was slightly reduced by both
mutations of the G/C rich elements in promoter A and B,
respectively and not further reduced by a double mutant
(Fig. 7F and data not shown). Remarkably, overexpression
of increasing amounts of BCL9-2 increased the activity of
the minimal wild type ESR1 reporter (Fig. 7F). BCL9-2
also activated the mutant ESR1 reporters. However, the
activation for both mutants was lower compared to the
wild type reporter when we titrated increasing amounts
of BCL9-2 (Fig. 7F). These data indicate that BCL9-2 coactivates ER transcription, which relies on several G/Crich elements representing potential Sp1 binding sites in
the most proximal ESR1 gene promoters.
Finally, we analyzed the interaction of endogenous
proteins by co-immunoprecipitation in MCF7 (Fig. 7G),
T47D (Suppl. Fig. 5D) and mouse BCL9-2 breast cancer
cells (Suppl. Fig. 3B). As expected, we found that BCL92 consistently co-precipitated with Pygo2 in all analyzed
cancer cells. Remarkably, BCL9-2 also co-precipitated
with Sp1. Vice versa Pygo2 co-precipitated with BCL9-2,
but barely detectable with Sp1. ß-catenin co-precipitated
with E-cadherin, but not with any other analyzed protein
in the breast cancer cells. Interaction of p53 with Sp1 or
BCL9-2 was not detectable by co-immunoprecipitation,
which presumably requires stabilization of the protein as
previously described [27]. Of note, immunoprecipitation
with the Sp1 antibody did not co-precipitate BCL9-2
or ER, as previously described, which might be due to
limited amounts or competition for binding of endogenous
proteins. Of note, we also did not detect ER after
precipitation of BCL9-2 or Pygo2, suggesting that they do
not interact. The same results were found in T47D human
breast cancer cells and in our primary BCL9-2 mouse
tumor cells (Suppl. Fig. 3B and 5D). In summary, we
have identified Sp1 as a novel binding partner of BCL92, which was previously unrecognized. This interaction
might explain the ß-catenin independent functions of
BCL9-2 to drive tumorigenesis. Our data uncover a novel
mechanism for BCL9-2 as co-factor, which acts together
with Sp1 and regulates ER transcription through the
proximal ESR1 gene promoter in breast cancer cells.

act together with Pygopus proteins as nuclear co-activators
of canonical Wnt/ß-catenin signals in development and
tumorigenesis [11; 12; 14; 15; 18]. Our previous work
indicated that the BCL9-2 proto-oncogene harbors
additional ß-catenin independent functions that promote
tumorigenesis [15].
We show here, that BCL9-2 overexpression in
vivo induced the formation ER+ breast tumors in aged
transgenic mice. Females developed breast cancers,
which exhibited a ductal-like morphology and highly
expressed nuclear ER, similar to human ER+ breast
cancers [1; 37]. We confirmed with specific markers, that
the mouse tumors might represent a model for human ER+
breast cancers since we detected strong co-expression
of nuclear ER and BCL9-2 both in human and mouse
BCL9-2 tumor samples. Moreover, we found that human
and mouse breast cancers contained a putative stromal
compartment with SMA positive cells, surrounding the
ER+, BCL9-2+ tumor cell clusters. Of note, SMA, a
marker of myofibroblasts, is not only expressed in basallike, hormone receptor negative cancers [38], but was
also previously reported for human ductal ER+ breast
cancers [39]. Moreover, SMA positive cells in breast
cancers might represent activated myofibroblasts in the
stroma and mark putative cancer-associated fibroblasts
[40; 41]. Interestingly, cancer-associated fibroblasts might
be the source of estrogen production in breast cancer
[42]. Of note, estrogens are primarily produced outside
of the ovary in postmenopausal women and in breast
cancers [43], and similarly, in our mouse model aged
females developed ER+ breast tumors. We also show
that the proliferation of primary BCL9-2 tumor cells was
sensitive to estrogen and tamoxifen treatment, suggesting
a functional role of BCL9-2 to control proliferation in
breast tumors. Correspondingly, human ER+ breast cancer
patients with high BCL9-2 in the primary tumor showed a
highly significant better overall survival when treated with
tamoxifen (see below).
Our BCL9-2 transgenic mouse model represents
one of the few genetic mouse models which develop ER+
breast tumors [8]. The phenotype of BCL9-2 mammary
tumors shares several intriguing similarities with tumors
from MMTV-Wnt1 transgenics in which we also
found high BCL9-2 expression (Zatula and Brembeck,
unpublished observations). It was suggested that activation
of the Wnt1 proto-oncogene targets a common luminal
progenitor, which results in ER+ mammary cancers [25;
44]. MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors are also at least in
part dependent on ER signaling, since tumorigenesis was
strongly delayed when crossed with ER knockout animals
[45]. Conditional deletion of Pygo2 in MMTV-Wnt1
animals similarly delayed the tumor onset, indicating
that Pygo2 also enhances Wnt1 driven tumorigenesis,
remarkably without affecting the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling
output [17]. Thus, BCL9-2 and its binding partner Pygo2
apparently drive breast tumor development in vivo by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ß-catenin independent mechanisms. Further investigations
are required to analyze the interplay of Wnt1/BCL9-2/
Pygo2 for the induction of ER+ breast tumors in vivo.
However, Wnt1 is not expressed in the normal
mammary gland and is not overexpressed in human breast
cancer [46; 47]. In contrast, we show here that BCL9-2 was
highly expressed in the normal breast during proliferative,
hormone dependent stages with increased ER expression,
i.e. during puberty and pregnancy [48]. Accordingly,
BCL9-2 was lost upon the normal postlactational and agerelated lobular involution, possibly as a consequence of
the loss of hormonal stimuli [43]. BCL9-2 overexpression
also conveys premalignant changes of the breast in vivo
since we found more hyperplastic alveoli in aged BCL9-2
females. Such preneoplastic foci in mutant mice indeed
harbor a malignant potential [43; 49]. Moreover, the
postlactational and the age-related lobular involution
of BCL9-2 females was delayed with persistence of
proliferating alveoli, similar to the disturbed mammary
involution of MMTV-Wnt1 and other mouse models [43].
In human, degradation of alveoli after pregnancy and in
postmenopausal women was suggested to be protective
against breast cancer [43]. Thus, persisting BCL9-2
expression disturbs the proper involution and may increase
the cancer risk.
Our results from human breast cancer cells further
argue for a role of BCL9-2 as regulator of ER expression
in breast cancer. We found highest BCL9-2 in ER+ human
breast cancer cells and show that BCL9-2 knockdown
strongly regulated ER expression on the transcriptional
level, which resulted in reduced ER protein level. ER target
gene expression was also reduced following knockdown of
BCL9-2, which was in part rescued by estrogen treatment
possibly due to the nuclear accumulation of preexisting
ER protein [32]. As biological consequences, depletion
of BCL9-2 also reduced the growth of ER+ breast cancer
cells, which may reflect impaired additional non-genomic
functions of ER after BCL9-2 downregulation [1].
We have further addressed the contribution of
the BCL9-2 co-factor for the transcriptional regulation
of ESR1 gene expression in breast cancer cells. ER
transcription is initiated from several promoters which
reside within 15 kB upstream of the ESR1 gene locus
[33]. Moreover, the promoters are differentially used
in normal ER expressing tissues or in cancer cells [33;
reviewed in 50]. The most proximal promoters are
predominantly activated in human breast cancer cells,
while a more distal promoter at -3 kB is alternatively
utilized in normal mammary epithelia, but far less in
breast cancer cells [5; 51]. The proximal promoters harbor
several G/C rich elements as putative Sp1 binding sites
and Sp1 has been shown to be an important regulator of
ESR1 gene expression in breast cancer cells [5-7]. Sp1, a
member of the Sp/Krüppel-like transcription factor family,
is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues, but highly
overexpressed in ER+ breast cancers [4]. Previous studies

Pygo genes are not Wnt/ß-catenin targets in cancer
cells [15]. However, we identified several putative
ERE elements in the upstream sequence of the BCL9-2
gene suggesting ER as a potential regulator of BCL92 transcription (Zatula and Brembeck, unpublished
observations). Of note, the BCL9-2 gene resides on
11q, which is one of the most frequently rearranged
chromosomal arms with repeated amplifications in human
breast cancers [57]. In future, whole genome sequencing
of cancer patient’s samples will provide more information
about possible rearrangements of the BCL9-2 locus. In
summary, our findings indicate that the expression of
BCL9-2 and ER are tightly connected in breast cancer
cells.
Finally, our study revealed the potential clinical
significance of BCL9-2 for human breast cancer. We
demonstrate that BCL9-2, but not the BCL9 homolog,
is overexpressed in most cancers and this was associated
with the pathological grade. Most importantly, BCL9-2
expression correlated with hormone receptor positivity
of the cancers: Triple negative breast cancers showed
no BCL9-2 overexpression, but BCL9-2 was elevated in
Her2 positive tumors, confirming a previous study [58].
Highest BCL9-2 was found in ER+ tumors, representing
the luminal subtypes of breast cancers. Thus, high BCL9-2
is associated with ER+ human breast cancer, as we found
in our animal model. From the clinical aspect, we propose
that high BCL9-2 in the primary tumor might predict a
favorable therapy response to anti-estrogen treatment,
based on our data analysis of tamoxifen treated patients
with ER+ breast cancers [28]. The primary response to
tamoxifen depends indeed on the maintenance of ER
expression [1; 28; 32; 56].
In summary, BCL9-2 acts as a novel molecular
determinant of ER expression. This might provide a
possible molecular mechanism how ER expression is
maintained in breast cancers that overexpress BCL9-2
and thus are sensitive to tamoxifen treatment. For future
clinical applications, assessing the levels of BCL9-2 in
human breast tumors could be valuable to determine if a
patient will benefit from anti-estrogen therapy.

have identified Sp1 binding to the most proximal ESR1
gene promoters, which recruits a multi-protein complex to
initiate ER transcription [5-7]. It was shown that promoter
B harbors a classical G/C box that is recognized by Sp1
[5; 6]. Moreover, we identified by promoter sequence
analyses multiple G/C-rich sequences in the ESR1 gene
promoter A. In fact, our ChIP analyses confirmed that
Sp1 and BCL9-2 are recruited both to promoter A and B.
Furthermore, using ESR1 reporter constructs, we found
that BCL9-2 co-activates the reporter to a similar extent
as previously demonstrated for Wnt-activity [11; 15; 52].
Mutation of the G/C-rich elements in the ESR1 reporter
slightly reduced the basal activity. However, co-activation
by BCL9-2 was impaired by mutations of the potential
Sp1 binding sites in promoter A and B, although we
did not identify the exact binding site. It is possible that
additional suboptimal sites might be also recognized by
Sp1 as previously reported [53; 54] and may contribute
to the activation by Sp1 and BCL9-2. In summary, we
provide evidence that BCL9-2 is recruited to the proximal
ESR1 gene promoters together with Sp1 and co-activates
basal ER transcription.
Moreover,
we
demonstrate
by
coimmunoprecipitation that BCL9-2 interacts with Sp1,
which may explain the mechanism how BCL9-2 and
Pygo2 are recruited to the ESR1 promoter. In fact, our
ongoing work further indicates that the Sp1-BCL9-2
interaction drives the expression of additional target genes
in cancer cells and that this interaction does not require
the ß-catenin binding domain of BCL9-2 (Wiese and
Brembeck, manuscript in preparation).
So far, transcriptional regulation of ER expression
by components of canonical Wnt-signaling has not yet
been described. A functional interaction between ER and
ß-catenin was reported for Drosophila [55]. However, we
did not detect an apparent interaction of endogenous ER
and ß-catenin or BCL9-2 proteins. Moreover, aberrant
activation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling is not associated
with luminal-like breast cancers [19]. Our data did not
provide evidence for elevated canonical Wnt-signaling
in ER+ human breast cancer cells, which was also
previously reported [55]. In fact, we did not see regulation
of ER expression after knockdown of ß-catenin in ER+
breast cancer cells. This is the first report that BCL9-2,
previously characterized as co-activator of Wnt/ß-catenin
signaling, regulates ER expression at the transcriptional
level by interaction with Sp1 through the proximal ESR1
gene promoter, apparently independently of ß-catenin.
Our data also suggest a feedback loop between
BCL9-2 and ER expression, since RNA levels of both,
BCL9-2 and ER, were downregulated after estrogen
stimulation. This is consistent with previous reports, that
the expression of ER and its transcriptional activators are
downregulated by estrogen [32; 56]. So far, transcriptional
regulation of BCL9-2 has not yet been studied in detail,
although we have previously shown that the BCL9 and
