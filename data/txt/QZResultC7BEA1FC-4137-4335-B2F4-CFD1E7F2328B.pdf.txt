BACKGROUND. Metastatic small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) has a poor prognosis. Because of the rarity of SBA, only a few studies have evaluated the role of
chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic SBA; thus, the benefit, if any, of
adding a platinum compound to fluorouracil (5-FU) is unknown. The objective
of this retrospective study was to determine whether the addition of a platinum
compound to 5-FU provided any benefit in the treatment of patients with metastatic SBA.

METHODS. The authors identified 80 patients with metastatic SBA who were treated with chemotherapy at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
between 1978 and 2005. Response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and

jejunum in 35 patients (43%), duodenum in 30 patients (38%), ileum in 6
patients (8%), and nonspecified small bowel in 9 patients (11%). Of all 80
(51%) received 5-FU without a platinum compound, and 10 patients (13%)
received non-5-FU–based treatment. Compared with other chemotherapy regimens, treatment with 5-FU and a platinum agent resulted in a higher response
rate (46% vs 16% with other regimens; P 5 .01) and longer median PFS (8.7
months vs 3.9 months; P  .01) but not better OS (14.8 months vs 12 months; P
5 .1). In multivariate analysis, treatment with 5-FU and a platinum compound
was a significant predictor of response (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.3-15.8; P 5 .02) and PFS (hazard ratio. 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.84; P 5 .01) but
only reached borderline significance for OS (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.37-1.07;
P 5 .08).

CONCLUSIONS. To the authors’ knowledge, the current analysis represents the largest number of patients with metastatic SBA treated with chemotherapy in the

compound leads to a higher response rate and PFS compared with other chemotherapy regimes. The authors concluded that prospective investigation of platinum analogues in the treatment of SBA is warranted. Cancer 2008;113:2038–45.

common histologic subtype of small intestinal cancer.1-3 Because of the difficulties in diagnosing SBA,
the majority of patients with SBA are not treated
until the disease has reached an advanced stage. The
outlook for patients with advanced SBA is poor:
According to the National Cancer Data Base, the 5year overall survival (OS) rates for patients with stage
III or stage IV SBA are 35% and 4%, respectively.4
Because of the rarity of SBA, no randomized
trials have evaluated the role of chemotherapy in this
disease. Recently, retrospective studies have demonstrated that treating advanced SBA patients with palliative chemotherapy has a survival benefit compared
with patients who do not receive palliative chemotherapy.5-7 In a retrospective study conducted by the
British Columbia Cancer Agency, patients with locally
advanced or metastatic SBA who received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy had a longer median OS (15.6 months) than patients who received no
chemotherapy (7.7 months).5 Another retrospective
study demonstrated that chemotherapy for patients
with inoperable or metastatic SBA resulted in an
improved median OS (12 months) compared with no
chemotherapy (2 months).6
The choice of chemotherapy has not been studied well for the treatment of SBA. A summary of
studies that evaluated various chemotherapy combinations in the treatment of metastatic SBA is provided in Table 1. In 1965, Rochlin et al reported the
first retrospective study to evaluate the role of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic SBA. In their
study, 11 patients with SBA who had been treated at
the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center had a 36% response rate (RR) to single-agent
fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment.8 Other retrospective
studies have reported RRs for 5-FU–based treatment
ranging from 5% to 18%.5,9,10 In 2005, the Eastern

Cooperative Group conducted the largest prospective
study of chemotherapy for SBA; 38 patients with SBA
received 5-FU, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C and
demonstrated an 18% RR and a median survival of 8
months.9
The benefit observed from the addition of a platinum chemotherapy agent to 5-FU–based chemotherapy in both colon adenocarcinoma and gastric
adenocarcinoma has suggested a possible role for
this kind of chemotherapy in the treatment of
SBA.11,12 Researchers at the Royal Marsden Hospital
reported a 37% RR and a median OS of 13 months
for 8 patients with SBA who were treated with epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU.13 A second retrospective
study by Fishman et al from the Princess Margaret
Hospital reported an RR of 23% for 11 patients who
received platinum-based therapy.7 Another retrospective study reported a 21% RR for 20 patients
with advanced SBA who were treated with a combination of 5-FU and a platinum agent.14 In an interim
analysis of 21 patients from a phase 2 study of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the small bowel and the ampulla of
Vater, we observed an RR of 52% and a median OS of
16.3 months.15 To clarify the optimal chemotherapy
for patients with metastatic SBA, we undertook this
retrospective study to determine the benefit, if any,
of adding a platinum agent to 5-FU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Data Collection
We identified all patients from the M. D. Anderson
Tumor Registry who were treated for metastatic SBA
at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (M. D. Anderson) between 1978 and 2005. In total, 177 patients
with metastatic SBA were identified, and 80 patients

who met the following criteria were included in this
report. Patients were required to have tumor histology that was reviewed at M. D. Anderson and was
consistent with SBA. Only patients who were undergoing first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease
and who received 1 cycle of chemotherapy were
included. Documentation of metastatic disease, either radiographically or at the time of surgery, was
required. Patients had to have undergone a radiologic assessment of tumor response after the administration of chemotherapy. Six patients who had
documented peritoneal involvement at surgery but
did not have radiographically measurable disease
were included in the study but were excluded from
the univariate and multivariate analyses for treatment response. Chemotherapy treatment in these 6
patients consisted of 5-FU (3 patients), 5-FU and carboplatin (1 patient), 5-FU and cisplatin (1 patient),
and 5-FU and oxaliplatin (1 patient). Patients who
had tumors that involved the ampulla of Vater were
excluded. Patients who were enrolled in an ongoing,
prospective, phase 2 study of capecitabine and oxaliplatin for SBA were not included in this study.
Patient medical records were reviewed for information regarding demographic data, tumor characteristics, treatment types, treatment responses, and
survival. Because of the long period covered by the
study and because not all radiologic images were
available for our review, response evaluation was
based on the treating physician’s response assessment. Tumor stage was determined according to the
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.16 Histologic grading was determined according
to the World Health Organization standard grading
system: poorly differentiated, moderately differentiated, well differentiated, or undifferentiated.
According to this system, tumors with 2 different
degrees of histiologic differentiation are recorded as
having the lesser grade. This analysis was approved
by the M. D. Anderson Institutional Review Board.

Statistical Analysis
We created descriptive summaries for each demographic and clinical variable. The following variables
were examined in univariate and multivariate analyses for RR, progression-free survival (PFS), and OS:
age, sex, histologic grade, primary site, stage at presentation, initial site of metastasis, surgery for primary tumor, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, and use
of platinum-based or 5-FU–based chemotherapy for
metastatic disease.
The Fisher exact test was used to assess the independence between 2 categorical variables. Survival
curves were calculated from the start of chemother-

apy using the Kaplan-Meier method. The 2-sided
log-rank test was used to test the association
between variables and OS and PFS. In the multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was
used to assess the simultaneous effect of 2 variables on OS and PFS. To compensate for advances in
supportive care, radiation therapy techniques, and
surgical techniques over the period studied, we
included chronological time as a covariate in all multivariate modeling. To obtain the best subset of variables in the final model, we performed stepwise
model selection. P values were derived from 2-sided
tests, and the statistical analyses were carried out
using S-PLUS 2000 software (MathSoft, Inc., Seattle,
Wash).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of the 80
patients who met our study’s inclusion criteria. The
median age was 53 years (range, 23-76 years), and 59
patients (74%) initially presented with stage IV disease. Of the 59 patients who presented with metastatic disease, 34 patients (58%) underwent surgical
resection of their primary tumor, 11 patients (19%)
underwent a surgical bypass, and 14 patients (23%)
underwent a biopsy. The liver and the peritoneum
were the most common initial sites of metastatic disease. Elevations in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
were not observed commonly, and only 31% of
patients had a CEA level >10 mg/dL.
The majority of patients had a primary tumor
site within the jejunum (n 5 35 patients; 44%) or the
duodenum (n 5 30 patients; 38%). Fifty-one patients
(64%) had moderately or well differentiated SBA.
Twelve patients (15%) had tumors with mucinous
histologic features, and 8 of those patients had well
to moderately differentiated tumors.
Of the 21 patients who initially presented with
stage I, II, and III disease but subsequently developed metastatic disease, 8 patients received adjuvant
chemotherapy, including 3 patients who received single-agent 5-FU therapy, 3 patients who received 5-FU
and radiation, 1 patient who received 5-FU and mitomycin C, and 1 patient who received 5-FU and carboplatin. Of the 8 patients who received adjuvant
chemotherapy, 7 patients (88%) had lymph node
involvement, whereas only 3 of the 13 patients (23%)
who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy had
lymph node involvement. The median time from
completion of adjuvant therapy to development of
metastatic disease was 7 months (range, 3-18 months).
The chemotherapy administered to these 8 patients

First-line Chemotherapy Treatment and Response
Forty-one patients (51%) received 5-FU–based therapy without a platinum agent; 29 patients (36%)
received 5-FU–based therapy with a platinum agent;
5 patients (6%) received non-5-FU–containing, platinum-based therapy; and 5 patients (6%) received a
nonplatinum, non-5-FU–based therapy (Table 3). 5FU was delivered intravenously in 53 patients (76%)
and as the oral 5-FU prodrug, capecitabine, in 17
patients (24%). Capecitabine was administered either
alone (1 patient), combined with cisplatin (9
patients), combined with oxaliplatin (6 patients), or

Of the 29 patients who received 5-FU and a platinum
agent, 3 patients (10%) also received a third agent
(paclitaxel in 1 patient, interferon-alpha in 1 patient,
and bevacizumab in 1 patient). Irinotecan combinations were given to 2 patients, and a gemcitabine
combination was given to 1 patient with no observed
responses.
The overall RR for the 80 patients was 25%, with
19 partial responses and 1 complete response. The
single complete response occurred in a patient who
had duodenal adenocarcinoma with biopsy-proven
peritoneal metastases. The patient had radiographic
resolution of her disease after 6 months of capecitabine and cisplatin and was alive without evidence of
recurrence 50 months after she completed chemotherapy. None of the 8 patients who had received
prior adjuvant chemotherapy responded to chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.
Table 4 compares patients who received a platinum agent and those who did not receive a platinum
agent. Platinum-based chemotherapy was given
more commonly to patients who had primary tumors
in the duodenum, initially presented with stage IV
disease, or did not undergo resection of their primary
tumor. Of the 74 patients who had metastatic disease
that was measurable radiographically at the start of
chemotherapy, the 26 patients who received 5-FU
and a platinum agent had a higher RR (46%) compared with the 48 patients who received other chem-

otherapy combinations (16%; P 5 .01). Treatment
with the combination of 5-FU and a platinum agent
was the only significant predictor of response in both
univariate and multivariate analyses (odds ratio, 4.5;
95% confidence interval, 1.3-15.8; P 5 .02). Patients
who had metastatic duodenal adenocarcinoma had a
slightly higher RR (34%) compared with patients who
had metastatic disease form other small bowel sites
(RR, 22%), but the difference was not significant (P
5 .29). Among the 26 patients who received 5-FU
and a platinum agent, the primary tumor site did not
correlate with response (RR: 47% for duodenal primaries, 44% for other small bowel sites).

Survival After First-line Chemotherapy Treatment
For the 80 patients who were included in this study,
the median follow-up was 47 months, the median OS
was 13 months (95% confidence interval, 10.4-16.5
months), and the median PFS was 4.6 months (95%
confidence interval, 3.9-7 months). Patients who
received 5-FU and a platinum agent had a higher
median PFS (8.7 months) than patients who received
other chemotherapy combinations (3.9 months; P 5
.003) (Fig. 1B). In the univariate analysis of PFS,

platinum agent (P 5 .02) were the only factors associated with improved PFS.
There was a trend toward a longer median OS in
the patients who were treated with 5-FU and a platinum agent (14.8 months) compared with other
patients (12 months), but the difference did not
reach statistical significance (P 5 .1) (Table 5, Fig.
1B). In the univariate analysis of OS, both resection
of the primary tumor (P 5 .01) and 5-FU treatment
(P 5 .02) were associated with improved OS. In addition, patients whose grade of adenocarcinoma was
not specified had a worse OS (P 5 .05); however, this
subset of patients was small (n 5 9). Resection of the
primary tumor was also analyzed in the subgroup of
patients who initially presented with stage IV disease.
Undergoing primary tumor resection in this subgroup was associated with an improved median OS
of 14.7 months compared with patients whose

primary tumor remained intact (median OS, 10.4
months; P 5 .048).
Table 6 shows the results of the multivariate
analyses of potential predictors of PFS and OS. More
recent chronological treatment and the lack of prior
adjuvant chemotherapy both were predictors of longer PFS and OS. Treatment with 5-FU and a platinum agent was a significant predictor of PFS (P <
.01) but did not reach statistical significance for OS
(P 5 .08). Resection of the primary tumor was a significant predictor of OS (P 5 .019) but not PFS.

Second- and Third-line Chemotherapy
Fifty-seven chemotherapy treatments were administered as second- or third-line chemotherapy to 38
patients. Six patients (11%) responded to treatment,
including 2 patients who responded to irinotecanbased therapy (n 5 16 treated patients), 2 patients
who responded to platinum-based therapy (n 5 6

In the current study, we observed that using 5-FU
and a platinum agent to treat SBA resulted in a significantly improved RR (46% vs 16%), and PFS (8.7
months vs 3.9 months) compared with other chemotherapy combinations. Treatment with 5-FU and a
platinum agent remained a significant predictor of
response and PFS in our multivariate analyses. With
regard to OS, the use of 5-FU and a platinum agent
was not a significant predictor, although the value (P
5 .08) was suggestive of a possible relation. It is our
opinion that the results of this study support the use
of combination chemotherapy with 5-FU and platinum analogue for the treatment of metastatic SBA.
The factors associated with an improved OS in
multivariate analysis were more recent chronological
treatment, absence of prior adjuvant chemotherapy,
and resection of the primary tumor. Of the 8 patients
who received adjuvant 5-FU–based therapy, none
responded to chemotherapy treatment for metastatic
disease. Of those 8 patients, 5 patients were retreated
with 5-FU-based nonplatinum and nonirinotecan
therapy. It is also possible that the patients with localized disease who received adjuvant therapy had
more aggressive tumor characteristics. Whether the
lower OS observed in patients who previously
received adjuvant 5-FU–based therapy was because
of prior exposure to 5-FU or because of a selection
bias is not known. Resection of the primary tumor
was significant not only for the entire 80-patient
cohort but also for the subset of patients who initi-

ally presented with stage IV disease. In this subgroup, patients who underwent resection of their primary tumor had an OS of 14.7 months compared
with 10.4 months for patients who did not undergo
surgical removal of the primary tumor. However, this
result may be confounded by the presence of a
greater burden of disease in those patients who did
not undergo resection.
Previous studies conducted primarily in patients
with localized SBA have suggested a worse outcome
for patients with adenocarcinoma of the duodenum
compared with to adenocarcinoma of the ileum or
jejeunm.4,6 In the current study, we observed no correlation between the primary tumor site and survival
in patients with metastatic SBA. Although more
patients with duodenal tumors were treated with a
platinum agent, duodenal tumors did not respond
better than nonduodenal small bowel tumors to platinum-based therapy.
The histologic grade of the tumor did not correlate with RR or PFS. Tumors that were classified as
adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified demonstrated a worse OS than tumors with well, moderate,
or poor differentiation. Only 9 patients had adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified, and those
patients tended to be patients who had been treated
in the earlier decades of this study. This result contrasts with other studies, in which poorly differentiated histology has been associated with a worse
survival.7,17,18 The most common sites of metastases
were the peritoneum and the liver, similar to prior
reports.19,20 Although peritoneal disease has been
associated with worse outcomes for other gastrointestinal malignancies, we observed no difference in
median OS between patients with and without
peritoneal disease (15 months and 12.7 months,
respectively).21
There is little information in the literature on the
use of second- and third-line chemotherapy for SBA.
Locher et al observed no radiographic responses to
primarily irinotecan-based, second-line chemotherapy administered to 13 patients with SBA.14 Fishman
et al observed responses to second-line chemotherapy
in 4 of 18 patients, and 3 of their patients responded
to gemcitabine-based therapy.7 In our study, a total of
57 chemotherapy treatments were given as either second-line or third-line therapy, and only 6 radiographic
responses were observed (RR, 11%).
We acknowledge that our report has several limitations and that our findings are hypothesis-generating. Important limitations are 1) the retrospective
nature of the report; 2) despite having a large denominator, interpretation of variables is limited by
the many small subgroups of patients; and 3) hetero-

geneous therapy over a long time (partially compensated by incorporating chronological time as a
covariate in our multivariate model). In addition, the
young age of our patient population suggests a possible referral bias.
The infrequency of SBA has made it difficult to
study. It is extremely unlikely that a randomized trial
comparing 2 chemotherapy regimens will be conducted. However, a prospective phase 2 trial conducted within a cooperative group or outside a
cooperative group (but in a multicenter setting)
should be encouraged.
In the current study, we observed that treatment
with 5-FU and a platinum agent was highly effective,
producing an RR of 41% and a median PFS of 8.7
months. Patients who receive this combination may
also gain an OS benefit. The combination of 5-FU
and a platinum agent appears to be superior to other
chemotherapy treatments, and this combination is
recommended for the frontline treatment of patients
with metastatic SBA.
